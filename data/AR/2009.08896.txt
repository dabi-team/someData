Abstract 

Recently there have been significant theoretical advances in our understanding of liquids and dense 
supercritical fluids based on their ability to support high frequency transverse (shear) waves.  Here, 
we have constructed a new computer model using these recent theoretical findings (the phonon 
theory of liquid thermodynamics), to model liquid internal energy across a wide pressure-
temperature range.  We have applied it to a number of real liquids in both the subcritical regime and 
the supercritical regime, in which the liquid state is demarcated by the Frenkel line.  Our fitting to 
experimental data in a wide pressure-temperature range has allowed us to test the new theoretical 
model with hitherto unprecedented rigour.  We have quantified the degree to which the prediction 
of internal energy and heat capacity is constrained by the different input parameters: The liquid 
relaxation time (initially obtained from the viscosity), the Debye wavenumber and the infinite-
frequency shear modulus.  The model is successfully applied to output the internal energy and heat 
capacity data for several different fluids (Ar, Ne, N2, Kr) over a range of densities and temperatures.  
We find that the predicted heat capacities are extremely sensitive to the values used for the liquid 
relaxation time.  If these are calculated directly from the viscosity data then, in some cases, changes 
within the margins of experimental error in the viscosity data can cause the heat capacity to exhibit 
a completely different trend as a function of temperature.  Our code is computationally inexpensive, 
and it is available for other researchers to use.

Introduction 

The heat capacity of liquids, and of supercritical fluids at liquidlike density displays – at first sight – 
highly unusual behaviour, since on an isochoric or isobaric temperature increase it typically 
decreases rather than increases.  In contrast, the heat capacity of gases and solids stays constant 
upon temperature increase or increases, as thermal energy becomes available for a wider spectrum 
of excitations.  The heat capacity of fluids at liquid-like density has therefore not historically been 
modelled from first principles.  The conventional method used to model dense fluid heat capacity is 
the fundamental equation of state, an empirical expression for the Helmholtz free energy of the fluid 
𝐻(𝜌, 𝑇) as a function of the density (𝜌) and temperature (𝑇) from which the heat capacities, as well 
as many other parameters such as the pressure 𝑃, can be derived1,2,3.  The prediction of the fluid 
heat capacity under the conditions for which 𝐻(𝜌, 𝑇) was fitted to experimental data are highly 
accurate.  However the drawbacks of this method are the mathematical and computational 
complexity, and the lack of relation to first principles which means that extrapolation to model 𝜌, 𝑇 
conditions or mixture compositions for which the expression for the Helmholtz free energy was not 
fitted to experimental data is not reliable. 

Thus, alternate methods to model the fluid heat capacity have been developed in recent years, in 
particular by accounting for the ability of dense fluids to support high frequency transverse waves.  
This ability has been known about for some time, having been studied with molecular dynamics 
simulations4,5 and observed in a limited number of experiments with methods such as Brillouin 
spectroscopy6.  What has happened only in recent years is that the existence of tranverse waves in 
dense fluids has been incorporated into a simple Debye-like model to predict the heat capacity of 
these fluids.  In particular, the decrease in heat capacity upon temperature increase has been 
understood as being due to the spectrum of transverse waves that can be supported by the fluid 
decreasing as temperature rises7,8,9.  In 2012 the heat capacity of a variety of liquidsa was modelled 
(albeit over a limited range of one isobar per fluid)7, using Eq. (1) to account for the contribution 
(𝑈𝑇) of the transverse waves to the internal energy: 

𝑈𝑇(𝜔 > 𝜔𝐹) = 2 (1 +

(1) 

Here, 𝛽 is the thermal expansion coefficient and 𝑁𝐴 is Avogadro’s number.  This model is referred to 
as the phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics, and has been applied also to nanofluids and 
wetting effects10,11.  Equation 1 arises from the hypothesis that transverse waves can be supported 
between a certain minimum frequency 𝜔𝐹 (calculated from Frenkel’s temperature-dependent liquid 
relaxation time 𝜏𝑅(𝐹)(𝑇)) and the Debye frequency 𝜔𝐷.  Experimental measurements of Frenkel’s 
(atomistic) liquid relaxation time are only available for a small selection of extremely viscous liquids 
close to the melting curve.  They are not available for typical liquids over a wide 𝜌, 𝑇 range as would 
be required for modelling trends in liquid heat capacity.  However, 𝜏𝑅(𝐹)(𝑇) can be estimated by 
equating it to Maxwell’s (macroscopic) liquid relaxation time 𝜏𝑅(𝑀)(𝑇).  The Maxwell relaxation time 
can be obtained from the infinite-frequency shear modulus and the temperature-dependent 
experimentally measured viscosity4: 

a Here, and subsequently, we use the term “liquid” to describe a fluid at supercritical temperature on the 
liquid-like (high density) side of the Frenkel line, as well as at subcritical temperature.

𝜏𝑅(𝑀)(𝑇) =

𝜂(𝑇)
𝐺∞

(2) 

Thus the internal energy (and hence the heat capacity) can be modelled using the experimental data 
for the viscosity and thermal expansion coefficient along with just two adjustable parameters: 𝜔𝐷 
and 𝐺∞ (the infinite frequency shear modulus).  These took physically reasonable values for the 
liquids studied in ref. 7. 

There is, however, much development and testing of the phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics 
still required.  The present work tackles four areas in which further work is needed: 

Firstly, the manner in which it is necessary to use empirically adjustable parameters to model the 
heat capacity is not clear at present.  Any model for liquid heat capacity requires the use of 
empirically adjustable parameters since experimental measurements are not widely available of all 
the parameters required; So the use of adjustable parameters does not necessarily indicate a 
shortcoming in the model.  In ref. 7 the Debye frequency was set to the value observed for the solid 
state of each substance studied, then a physically reasonable value of 𝐺∞ was obtained by a manual 
parameter fitting process.  It is thus not clear if the values chosen are those that provide the best fit 
to the data.  What are the consequences if values which are not physically reasonable turn out to 
provide a better fit to the data? 

Secondly, to date no testing has taken place in which the theory has been used to predict the heat 
capacity along multiple 𝑃, 𝑇 or 𝜌, 𝑇 paths for the same fluid.  What are the consequences if the best-
fit values of the fitting parameters do not exhibit the expected trends when compared across 
different paths?  For instance, if several 𝜌, 𝑇 paths are examined the best-fit value of 𝐺∞ should not 
decrease upon density increase.  What if it does? 

Thirdly, by definition 𝐶𝑉 ≡ (𝜕𝑈 𝜕𝑇⁄

differentiation of 𝑈 provides (𝜕𝑈 𝜕𝑇⁄

)𝑉 but implementations of the phonon theory of liquid 

)𝑃.  It is not clear what additional steps have been taken to 

)𝑉 from the data along isobars. 

Fourthly, a more detailed look at the viscosity data is required.  Thus far, the viscosity data required 
to calculate 𝜏𝑅(𝑀)(𝑇) has been fitted with the VFT (Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann) law (given later in Eq. 
(3)) before input into Eq. (2)12.  The VFT law has some theoretical foundation at low temperatures13 
but it is not clear if it provides a good fit to the data throughout the wide 𝑃, 𝑇 range in which we 
would like to calculate 𝜏𝑅(𝑀)(𝑇) from the viscosity, whilst retaining physically realistic values of the 
parameters (particularly 𝑇0 > 0).  In some preliminary work, we found that the obtained 𝐶𝑉 could be 
drastically affected by small changes in the input values used for the viscosity, as has been noted 
elsewhere12.  It is thus crucial that the manner in which the viscosity data has been prepared for 
input into Eq. (2) is laid out in a clear and unambiguous manner. 

In this work, we present an improved and computationally inexpensive methodology for modelling 
the heat capacity of a variety of liquids over a wide 𝜌, 𝑇 range including at significantly supercritical 
temperature on the liquid side of the Frenkel line and at the lowest temperatures where the liquid 
phase exists, close to the triple point.  We provide an explicit clarification of what parameters are 
empirically adjustable and how they were adjusted, and provide full details of the methodology to 
enable our work to be applied by other researchers.  This can provide a firm foundation for future 
work in which this and similar models are applied to the heat capacity on the transition across the

Frenkel line into the gas state, and to 𝜌, 𝑇 conditions and fluid mixture compositions for which 
experimental data are not yet available. 

2.  Development of the fluid energy model 

In this section we outline the physical principles underpinning the development of our “fluid energy” 
computer model to fit observed liquid heat capacities from first principles.  The model is 
implemented in C++ using our own code to search the parameter space and perform nonlinear 
regression analysis, and using code from the Gnu Scientific Library14 to perform numerical 
integration for calculations equivalent to Eq. (1).  We have used our model to model the heat 
capacity along isochores since parameters such as 𝑘𝐷, 𝐺∞ are likely to vary less along isochores than 
along isobars, and because a direct differentiation of the internal energy provides the heat capacity

)𝑉 without any additional steps.  Minor computational details are dealt with in the 

2.1 Fitting to the output from the fundamental equation of state 

To begin, it is appropriate to outline certain matters relating to the experimental data with which we 
are comparing the output of our model.  We compare our output to the output provided by the 
relevant fundamental equation of state available via NIST REFPROP15.  The fundamental equation of 
state is a mathematical model giving the Helmholtz free energy of the fluid (in the liquid, 
supercritical fluid and gas states) as a function of density and temperature: 𝐻(𝜌, 𝑇).   It is not 
possible to directly measure this quantity experimentally but a wide variety of experimentally 
measurable properties of the fluid (for instance  pressure, heat capacities, speed of longitudinal 
sound waves) can be obtained from 𝐻(𝜌, 𝑇) using mathematical relations obtained directly from 
first principles.  The fundamental equation for 𝐻(𝜌, 𝑇) for a specific fluid is a complex equation 
containing ca. 50 empirically adjustable parameters, and many terms (the “bank of terms” in the 
residual part) in which the mathematical forms of the terms are chosen empirically, not just the 
parameter values1-3.  The adjustable parameters are obtained using nonlinear regression analysis to 
result in an expression for 𝐻(𝜌, 𝑇) which accurately models the available experimental data.  It is 
common for the fundamental EOS to model all available data to an accuracy of ±~0.5% so here, 
and elsewhere, the output from the fundamental EOS is simply referred to as “data” and is treated 
as experimental data.  However it is not a model obtained from first principles so cannot be reliably 
extrapolated to predict fluid properties under conditions where it has not been fitted, or at least 
compared, to the original experimental data. 

For this work, we utilize the fundamental equation of state outputs for the internal energy 𝑈, 
longitudinal sound speed 𝑐𝐿, viscosity 𝜂 and pressure 𝑃.  All of these parameters can be obtained 
directly from 𝐻(𝜌, 𝑇) via NIST REFPROP and further details found in the relevant publications16-19.  In 
the earlier work7,12 to model fluid heat capacity from first principles using the phonon theory of 
liquid thermodynamics, an expression for the internal energy incorporating Eq. (1) and an equivalent 
equation for the contribution from longitudinal waves was numerically differentiated and the results 
manually compared to the values of 𝐶𝑉 obtained from 𝐻(𝜌, 𝑇) via NIST REFPROP. 

Obtaining the best values of any adjustable parameters using a proper nonlinear regression analysis 
procedure fitting to 𝐶𝑉, 𝐶𝑃 directly would be challenging since these depend on derivatives of the 
quantity we are calculating (for instance Eq. (1) for 𝑈𝑇 and an equivalent expression for 𝑈𝐿).  

4 

 
 
 
Therefore in our model we fit to the internal energy 𝑈 directly and then compare our results to the 
observed heat capacities.  This enables us to use nonlinear regression analysis to obtain the best 
values of adjustable parameters in our work.  Whilst it is not guaranteed that nonlinear regression 
analysis will provide the best fit (only linear regression analysis can do that), it is the best approach 
available. 

2.2 Preparation of viscosity data 

The Frenkel relaxation time 𝜏𝑅(𝐹) is not directly measurable; it is defined atomistically as the length 
of time a fluid particle spends in an equilibrium position before moving to a new equilibrium 
position.  However, it is expected to be the same order of magnitude as the Maxwell relaxation time 
𝜏𝑅(𝑀) which is defined using Eq. (2) in terms of macroscopic fluid properties.  Generally, 
experimental measurements of 𝐺∞ are not available but it is not expected to vary significantly as a 
function of temperature at constant pressure or density.  We therefore assume that it is 
independent of temperature along an isochore and treat it as a single fitting parameter.  The 
viscosity of both liquids and gases varies with temperature.  In a liquid at subcritical temperature the 
viscosity roughly follows the VFT law13 (Eq. (3)) in which the viscosity decreases upon temperature 
increase, although other theoretical models are available20,21. 

𝜂(𝑇) = 𝜂∞𝑒𝐴 (𝑇−𝑇0)

⁄

(3) 

In the gas state viscosity is independent of density and follows the simple relation 𝜂(𝑇) = 𝐽√𝑇, 
increasing as a function of temperature22 contrary to the trend observed in liquids.  Here, we wish to 
model the heat capacity of liquids at supercritical temperature on the liquid side of the Frenkel line.  
Under these conditions the viscosity, whilst not following the simple √𝑇 dependence observed for 
gases, does begin to increase upon (isochoric) temperature increase.  The raw viscosity data cannot 
therefore be used to calculate the relaxation time according to Eq. (2) as the viscosity is transitioning 
between liquid-like and gas-like behaviour.  Our solution is to fit the viscosity data using Eq. (4), 
separating out the components representing liquid-like and gas-like behaviour.  This regression 
analysis is performed using Magicplot Pro and the parameter 𝐽 is supplied to the fluid energy 
program along with the raw viscosity data so that the component representing gas-like behaviour 
can be subtracted from the viscosity data before use.  The only constraint in the regression analysis 
procedure is that 𝑇0 > 0 as it is only physically realistic for 𝑇0 to take positive values.  In some cases 
we find that 𝑇0 = 0 provides the best fit, in which case Eq. (3) simplifies to the Arrhenius equation.  
Figure 1 shows an example of this fit, the Ar (argon) isochore from 120 K – 500 K at 30.0 mol L-1. 

𝜂(𝑇) = 𝜂∞𝑒𝐴 (𝑇−𝑇0)

⁄

+ 𝐽√𝑇 

(4) 

Henceforth the liquid-like viscosity component that is used by the fluid energy program will be 
denoted by 𝜂𝐿, where 𝜂𝐿 = 𝜂 − 𝐽√𝑇.  Thus the only processing of the viscosity data is to subtract the 
component representing gas-like behaviour, modelled using the 𝐽√𝑇  term which is the temperature 
dependence of viscosity in a gas expected from first principles.  The only way in which the overall fit 
to the viscosity data from Eq. (4) is utilized is to select the value of 𝐽.

2.3 k-gap versus frequency gap 

Eq. (1) arises directly from Frenkel’s proposal of the liquid relaxation time 𝜏𝑅(𝐹).  The dispersion 
relation for transverse waves is assumed to remain linear, but waves with longer period than 𝜏𝑅(𝐹) 
cannot propagate.  There is therefore a “gap” in both the frequency / energy domain and the 
wavenumber domain of missing transverse waves expressed in the non-zero lower integral limit in 
Eq. (1).  Since then, it has been proposed that the gap in fact exists in the wavenumber domain, the 
so-called “k-gap”23,24.  In this case, the dispersion relation for transverse waves is given by: 

𝜔𝑇(𝑘) = √𝑐𝑇

2𝑘2 −

4𝜏𝑅(𝐹)

(5) 

This dispersion relation is obtained by solving a form of the Navier-Stokes equation, modified to 
consider the effect of short-term elasticity in the fluid.  Equation (5) has also been given utilizing 
4.  The questions of how similar these relaxation times are, and which is the 
𝜏𝑅(𝑀) in place of 𝜏𝑅(𝐹)
correct one to use in Eq. (5), are the subject of ongoing debate25,26.  In either case 𝜔𝑇(𝑘𝑔𝑎𝑝) = 0 
where 𝑘𝑔𝑎𝑝 = 1 2𝑐𝑇𝜏𝑅(𝐹/𝑀)
𝑘𝑔𝑎𝑝√2 are overdamped so do not propagate23.  For 𝑘 > 𝑘𝑔𝑎𝑝√2 the frequencies obtained using Eq. 
(5) and 𝜔𝑇(𝑘) = 𝑐𝑇𝑘 differ only by a factor of ≤ √2.  The discrepancy decreases on further increase 
of 𝜔, 𝑘 and due to the increased energy of each individual excitation combined with the increasing 
density of states (∝ 𝑘2) these are the modes which have the dominant effect on 𝑈. 

 so modes with 𝑘 < 𝑘𝑔𝑎𝑝 do not exist.  Modes with 𝑘𝑔𝑎𝑝 < 𝑘 <

⁄

It is probably as a result of these factors that we have not found it necessary to incorporate the non-
linear dispersion relation (5) into our model and we have made only one change resulting from the 
k-gap theory.  In ref. 7 the total internal energy is given as: 𝑈 = 𝑈𝐿 + 𝑈𝑇(𝜔 > 𝜔𝐹) +
𝑈𝑇(𝜔 < 𝜔𝐹) 2⁄ .  Here 𝑈𝐿 is the contribution from the longitudinal modes.  The final term in this 
expression accounts for the fact that, upon temperature increase, whilst the potential energy 
contribution from transverse modes is lost, the kinetic energy contribution remains; becoming the 
translational degrees of freedom that exist also in the gas state.  The kinetic energy contribution is 
1 2⁄  of the total energy, a result obtained from the virial theorem. 

Using the k-gap model, it is no longer appropriate to account for this using a term of the form 
𝑈𝑇(𝑘 < 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝) 2⁄  as with the dispersion relation given by Eq. (5) the low-k modes do not have a real 
energy.  We therefore use: 

𝑈 = 𝑈𝐿 +

𝑈𝑇(𝑘 > 𝑘𝑝)
2

+ 𝑅𝑇 

Here, the 𝑈𝑇 2⁄  term accounts for the potential energy associated with the transverse wave degrees 
of freedom (which is gradually lost upon temperature increase) and the 𝑅𝑇 term for the kinetic 
energy associated with these degrees of freedom.

2.4 The fluid energy model for 𝑼 

The expressions used here for the contributions to the fluid internal energy are similar to those in 
previous works7 but the derivations are given here to clarify what assumptions / approximations are 

7 

 
 
 
made in the derivation.  The objective is to evaluate the contributions to the fluid internal energy 
arising from longitudinal and transverse collective vibrational modes that can be treated using 
methods analogous to phonons in solids.  We begin with the expression from Landau and Lifshitz27 
for the contribution (𝐹𝑝ℎ) to the Helmholtz free energy of a solid arising from these vibrational 
modes: 

𝐹𝑝ℎ = 𝑘𝐵𝑇 ∑ ln [1 − 𝑒
𝑖

The internal energy contribution 𝑈𝑝ℎ is obtained by differentiating at constant volume27,28: 

𝑈𝑝ℎ = 𝐹𝑝ℎ − 𝑇 (

There are two approaches to deal with the remaining partial derivative.  The first is to assume that 
The Grüneisen approximation holds exactly as written, which is that both the temperature and 
pressure dependence of the vibrational frequencies can be incorporated into the volume 
dependence.  In this case,

to hold at liquid-like density7,29:

Where 𝛽 is the thermal expansion coefficient.  We thus introduce the parameter λ which is set to 
zero if the Grüneisen approximation is assumed to hold, and 0.5 if the equation above is used.  The 
final expression for the internal energy is therefore: 

𝑈𝑝ℎ = (1 + 𝜆𝛽𝑇) ∑

The components in our final expression for 𝑈 (equation (6)) are obtained from the above expression 
and given in Eq. (7) below.  The sum has been replaced by an integral and the density of states 𝑔(𝑘) 
(normalized for the correct number of modes to exist up to 𝑘𝐷) has been introduced, for a sample 
comprising one mole of particles.

𝜔𝑇(𝑘) = 𝑐𝑇𝑘 

The factor of 2 in the expression for 𝑈𝑇 is to account for the 2 degrees of freedom existing 
perpendicular to the propagation axis.  The parameter 𝑐𝐿 is the speed of longitudinal sound waves.  
We use the experimental data from NIST with no intermediate approximations / fitting.  The 
parameter 𝑐𝑇 is the speed of the transverse sound waves.  There are far fewer data on this available 
but it can be calculated from 𝐺∞, 𝜌 using Eq. (8): 

 (7) 

𝑐𝑇 = √

𝐺∞
𝜌𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠

Here, 𝜌𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 is the constant mass density along the isochore, and 𝐺∞ is the fitting parameter utilized 
also in the calculation of 𝜏𝑅(𝑀).  𝐺∞ is assumed to stay constant along the isochore.  The lower 
wavenumber limit 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝(𝑀) for transverse waves is calculated from 𝑘𝑔𝑎𝑝 obtained from Eq. (5), 
utilizing Eqs. (2) and (8). 

(8) 

𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝(𝑀) =

√𝜌𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠𝐺∞
𝜂𝐿√2

(9) 

The label (𝑀) indicates that the parameter has been calculated directly from Maxwell’s liquid 
relaxation time as given in Eq. (2).  The thermal expansion coefficient 𝛽(𝑇) is obtained directly from 
the experimental data at each temperature.  The different approaches to the parameter 𝜆 were 
outlined earlier.  Since the primary purpose of the present work is to test theoretical proposals 
against experimental data, the fluid energy model compares the fit to experimental data obtained 
with the values 𝜆 = 0,0.5.  The input parameters used to model the fluid internal energy and heat 
capacity along an isochore are summarized in table 1. 

The principal fitting parameters utilized by the fluid energy program are hence 𝑘𝐷 and 𝐺∞, whilst 𝜆 
can also be fitted to some extent (values of 0 and 0.5 are compared).  Therefore, in addition to 
producing the output of 𝑈 as a function of temperature for the best fit values of these parameters, 
the program produces (for the best fit values of 𝑘𝐷, 𝜆) the overall least-squares error in 𝑈 as a 
function of 𝐺∞, and the equivalent data for 𝑘𝐷.  It is therefore possible to evaluate how strongly the 
fit quality varies as a function of these variables.

2.5 Testing on liquid and supercritical Ar 

We initially tested the fluid energy program by studying fluid Ar along two isochores (30 Mol L-1 and 
32.5 Mol L-1) covering temperature range beginning in the subcritical region then extending as far as 
the Frenkel line in the supercritical region.  Figure 2 is the 𝜌, 𝑇 phase diagram of fluid Ar (further 
details given in ref. 30), on which these isochores are illustrated.

development of the fluid energy program and the blue line (d) denotes the isochore studied during 
our investigations of the subcritical liquid state in section 3.3.  The grey shaded area indicates the 
region not covered by the fundamental equation of state data.

Figure 3 shows the results of a systematic search of the λ,𝑘𝐷, 𝐺∞ parameter space on the 30 Mol.L-1 
isochore.  In this run, 2 x 502 points in the parameter space were searched: 50 values of 𝑘𝐷 (1.0 – 1.4 
x 1010 m-1) combined with 50 values of 𝐺∞ (0.1 – 5.0 GPa) and 𝜆 = 0,0.5.  The values of 𝑘𝐷 were 
chosen to be close to the value of 1.2 x 1010 m-1 estimated from comparison to the solid state (see 
supplementary information) and values of 𝐺∞ were selected to cover a wide range.  As shown in the 
figure, and in similar results obtained at 32.5 Mol.L-1, a reasonable fit to the internal energy can be 
obtained using the methodology described thus far.  However, the heat capacities are obtained from 
the derivative (𝜕𝑈 𝜕𝑇⁄
)𝑉 so it is necessary to obtain a much better fit to the internal energy to 
obtain a good prediction of the heat capacities.  The next section describes how this is achieved 
using the last stage of regression analysis in the fluid energy program.

energy of fluid Ar at 30 Mol.L-1.  Parameter values shown are those resulting in the best fit to the 
data. 

2.6 Refinement of the minimum shear wavenumber 𝒌𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒑 

The parameter 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 appearing as the lower limit to the integral for 𝑈𝑇 in Eq. (7) has been 
calculated thus far using Eq. (9) which is derived from the expression for Maxwell relaxation time 
𝜏𝑅(𝑀).  However, it has also been proposed to calculate it using the Frenkel relaxation time 𝜏𝑅(𝐹)
Whilst these relaxation times are expected to be the same order of magnitude, they are not the 
same quantity.  The last stage in the fitting process in the fluid energy program allows this degree of 
freedom by refining 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 at each temperature to obtain a value for 𝑈 that most closely matches 
the NIST data.  Figure 4 (a) compares the values of 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 obtained using Eq. (9) (𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝(𝑀)) and the 
values taken by 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 following the refinement process (𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝(𝐹)) with the 30 Mol.L-1 Ar data 

23,24.  

11 

 
 
 
shown in figure 3.  Figure 4 (b) shows the results for 𝐶𝑉 obtained following the parameter search and 
refinement processes.  As shown, the parameter search process produces a poor fit for 𝐶𝑉.  This 
problem is rectified by the refinement process, despite the modest changes to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 (< 0.3% at 30 
Mol.L-1 and < 1.3% at 32.5 Mol.L-1).  The nonlinear regression analysis code utilized for the 
refinement is described in the supplementary information. 

Note that the freedom given to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 here is greater than the freedom given at the earlier stage 
(searching the 𝐺∞, 𝑘𝐷 parameter space).  At the earlier stage the absolute value of 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 could be 
varied by changing 𝐺∞, but since 𝐺∞ is independent of temperature in our model the variation of 
𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 as a function of temperature was determined solely by the temperature-dependent viscosity 
𝜂𝐿.  At this stage however, we also allow the temperature dependence of 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 to be different from 
the temperature dependence of 𝜂𝐿. 

It is this part of the fitting process for which the decision to fit to 𝑈, rather than directly fit to 𝐶𝑉, is 
essential.  Adjusting 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 at a certain temperature would cause opposite effects on the gradient 
(𝜕𝑈 𝜕𝑇⁄
)𝑉 on each side of the chosen temperature so getting the process to converge towards a 
better overall fit to 𝐶𝑉 would be very challenging.

2.6 Validity of the fluid energy model 

The fluid energy model as presented here does not remain valid if the Frenkel line is crossed into the 
gas / gas-like state, for two reasons.  Firstly, as 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 → 𝑘𝐷 the value of the integral for 𝑈𝑇 in 
equation (9) approaches zero.  Then, when 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 > 𝑘𝐷  the integral has to be manually removed 
from the calculation to avoid the existence of a negative contribution to the internal energy.  There 
would thus be a discontinuity in the gradient (𝜕𝑈 𝜕𝑇⁄
)𝑉 at 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 = 𝑘𝐷.  Secondly, in the gas state 
the contribution to 𝑈 from potential energy associated with longitudinal phonon-like vibrations 
gradually disappears also.  Eq. (9) does not account for this effect.  The heat capacity of gases close 
to the Frenkel line has been modelled in separate work31. 

The model does, however, give the correct behaviour up to the Frenkel line at 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 = 𝑘𝐷.  At this 
point 𝑈𝑇 = 0 and 𝑈 = 𝑈𝐿 + 𝑅𝑇 (c.f. Eq. (6)).  Provided that adequate thermal energy is available to 
excite all longitudinal modes (𝑘𝐵𝑇 ≫ ħ𝑐𝐿𝑘𝐿), Eq. (7) simplifies to 𝑈𝐿 ≈ 𝑅𝑇 giving 𝐶𝑉 = 2𝑅 as 
expected. 

In addition, the model can fail if we attempt to cover a very large temperature range in a single 
isochore.  For instance, in the case of Ar the isochore shown in figure 2 at 34 MolL-1, running from 
150 K to 700 K (the highest temperature at which data is available from the fundamental EOS) is the 
largest temperature range for which a physically realistic output can be achieved.  In this case 
(shown in figure 5) 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 began to show the physically unrealistic behaviour of decreasing on 
temperature increase at the highest and lowest temperatures in the isochore.

3 Results 

We selected Ne (neon) and N2 (nitrogen) as suitable fluids with which to run the fluid energy 
program over a range of isochores in the supercritical state.  Both are simple fluids in which the 
Frenkel line has been characterized in some detail32,33.  We also examined subcritical isochores close 
to the triple point for Ar and Kr (Krypton). 

3.1 Ne 

Internal energy and heat capacity data for fluid Ne are available from NIST up to a density of 62 
Mol.L-1.  We ran the fluid energy model along four isochores in the rigid liquid state, as illustrated in 
figure 6 (a) on the 𝜌, 𝑇 phase diagram (further details given in ref. 30).  In all cases we were able to 
obtain a good fit for 𝐶𝑉 with very limited changes to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 during the refinement process (< 0.2%).  
Since 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 ∝ 1 𝜂⁄ , the experimental error in the viscosity data propagates through to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝.  The 
changes to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 during the refinement process are within the error in the viscosity data, yet cause 
significant changes to 𝐶𝑉 which are large compared to the experimental error (5%) on this 
parameter.  Figure 6 (b) shows, at 60 Mol.L-1, the effect on 𝐶𝑉 of the ±0.2% changes to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 made 
during the refinement process. 

The best-fit value of 𝜆 was 0.5 in all four cases.  The best-fit values of 𝑘𝐷, 𝐺∞ took physically 
reasonable values, however they varied in a haphazard manner on density increase rather than 
displaying the trend which should exist (a small increase upon density increase in both cases).  We 
therefore ran the fluid energy program with 𝑘𝐷 = 1.42 × 1010 m-1, the average value obtained from 
the calculations in which 𝑘𝐷 was allowed to vary.  In this case 𝐺∞ exhibited the expected trend (a 

14 

 
 
 
 
small increase on density increase).  The changes to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 required during the refinement process 
increased slightly but remained very small (<0.8%).  Table 1 gives all fit parameters from the 
calculations on Ne.

The upper temperature bound of our investigation of fluid Ne is formed by the Frenkel line.  The 
lower temperature bound was determined by the need to avoid the well-documented anomalies in 
the output from the fundamental EOS in the subcritical region34.  Relative to the critical temperature 
(44.5 K), this has allowed us to study the range 𝑇𝑅 = 𝑇 𝑇𝐶⁄ = 2 − 4. 

3.2 N2 

In our study of fluid N2, it was possible to examine a greater range in absolute temperature, and also 
in density.  The upper (315 K) and lower (160 K) temperature bounds of our study of fluid nitrogen 
were dictated by the need to subtract the heat capacity contribution due to the intra-molecular 
degrees of freedom.  To check this, we examined the heat capacity data in the gas state (the 0.01 
MPa isobar and 0.05 Mol.L-1 isochore).  Within this temperature range, 𝐶𝑉 stays constant at 5𝑅 2⁄  to 
within ±0.07% as the rotational degree of freedom is excited whilst the vibrational degree of 
freedom is not.  This was accounted for by subtracting 𝑅𝑇 from the values of 𝑈 obtained from NIST 
prior to entry into the fluid energy program.  Above 315 K the vibrational degree of freedom 
becomes excited causing a gradual change in 𝐶𝑉.  Below 160 K the rotational degree of freedom 
must be gradually lost but it is not possible to discern at exactly what temperature this process 
begins as 𝐶𝑉 in the gas state rises rapidly as the sublimation curve is approached.  Nevertheless, our 
investigation of fluid nitrogen covers 𝑇𝑅 = 1.27 − 2.5. 

In terms of density, our investigation runs from 25 Mol.L-1 (the lowest density at which we can cover 
a significant temperature range without crossing the Frenkel line into the gas state) to 30.9 Mol.L-1 
(the highest density for which experimental heat capacity data are available).  In figure 7 the ρ,T 
phase diagram of N2 is shown with the isochores studied here included.  Further details on the phase 
diagram data are given in ref. 30.

Figure 7.  𝜌, 𝑇 diagram of fluid nitrogen showing the first order phase transition lines alongside the 
Frenkel line.  The isochores studied in the present work are marked in red. 

When the fluid energy simulation was run for nitrogen along these isochores a good fit was obtained 
to the experimental 𝑈, 𝐶𝑉.  In this case, 𝜆 = 0.5 was generally preferred.  The fitting process only 
selected 𝜆 = 0 for 25 Mol.L-1.  A rerun of the calculation with 𝜆 = 0.5 fixed resulted in small changes 
to 𝑘𝐷, 𝐺∞ and a reduction in the total least squares error in 𝑈 following the parameter space 
searching process of about 30%.  In figure 8 the discrepancy between the theoretical value of 𝑈 
obtained in the parameter space search at 25 Mol.L-1 is shown for 𝜆 = 0,0.5.  As shown, the 
improvement to the fit obtained by allowing 𝜆 = 0 is limited. 

Similarly to Ne, the fitted values of 𝑘𝐷, 𝐺∞ are physically reasonable but do not exhibit the expected 
trends as a function of increasing density.  We therefore ran the calculations with 𝑘𝐷 fixed at the 
average value of 1.17 × 1010 m-1.  Again, this resulted in 𝐺∞ exhibiting a monotonic increase with 
increasing density as expected.  With 𝑘𝐷 fixed, 𝜆 = 0 usually resulted from the fitting process.

at 25 Mol.L-1 for 𝜆 = 0,0.5. 

Throughout the calculations listed in table 2, the adjustments to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 made during the refinement 
process to ensure an excellent fit to 𝐶𝑉 did not exceed ±2.0% and in most cases did not exceed 
±0.7%.  Similarly to the case of Neon, these changes are within the error in the experimental data, 
the viscosity output from the fundamental EOS. 

3.3 Some liquids in the subcritical regime 

Most of the 𝜌, 𝑇 space occupied by the liquid state is in the supercritical (𝑇 > 𝑇𝐶) regime in wnich 
the lower density limit of the liquid state is the Frenkel line.  However, we have also tested our 
model for fluids in the subcritical regime.  In this section we show results for Ar and Kr (Krypton) 
following isochores beginning from close to the triple point.  For Ar we have fitted 100 – 170 K at 35 
Mol.L-1 (illustrated on figure 2) and for Kr we have fitted 125 – 225 K at 29 Mol.L-1, an isochore lying 
very close to the density of liquid Kr at the triple point.  The relatively small temperature range was 
chosen so that a good fit to the viscosity could be obtained throughout by the VFT law, with no gas-
like √𝑇 component.  After checking this, the fluid energy program was run using the raw viscosity 
data with no fitting or baseline subtraction whatsoever.  In both cases, a good fit to the 
experimentally observed heat capacity could be obtained with a physically realistic values for 𝐺∞ 
(2.35(2) GPa for Ar, 3.51(3) GPa for Kr) and 𝑘𝐷 (7.3(1) × 109 m-1 for Ar, 5.9(2) × 109 m-1 for Kr), 
with small changes to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 in the refinement process.  The maximum change required for Ar was 
2.8% (slightly larger than the uncertainty in the viscosity output from the fundamental EOS of 2%) 
and the maximum change required for Kr was 0.6%.  Unfortunately it has not been possible to get 
access to the original publication describing the fundamental EOS in use for Kr to obtain the error in 
the viscosity output, however the changes required to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 are very small indeed in this case. 

18 

 
 
 
The low temperature limit for the Ar results was 1.19𝑇𝑇 and for the Kr results 1.08𝑇𝑇 where 𝑇𝑇 is 
the temperature at the triple point, the lowest temperature at which the liquid state exists.  The 
fluid energy program begins to fail at temperatures extremely close to the triple point.  Figure 9 
shows the trends in 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 after the parameter space searching, and after refinement, for both Ar 
and Kr.

4. Discussion and conclusions 

The investigations described in sections 2 and 3 constitute the most detailed and rigorous test of the 
phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics to date.  From the studies presented here we conclude 
that the theory can model the internal energy of fluids over a wide 𝑃, 𝑇 range with sufficient 
accuracy to model the heat capacity also.  The unique behaviour of dense fluid heat capacity (that it 
decreases upon temperature increase) is successfully accounted for.  Where input parameters are 
required other than the experimental data (𝑃𝑉𝑇 EOS, speed of sound, viscosity) we can confidently 
state that the parameters take best-fit values which (i) are physically reasonable, (ii) are consistent 
with the available experimental data and (iii) exhibit the expected trends as a function of 

19 

 
 
 
 
temperature and density.  We can therefore draw some clear conclusions about the input 
parameters and model. 

4.1 What values can the input parameters take? 

We can make the following specific conclusions about the different input parameters: 

1.  The Debye wavenumber 𝑘𝐷.  Within the constraint that 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 < 𝑘𝐷 (when this condition is 

violated our model is expected to fail) the fit quality obtained using the model is not 
sufficiently well-constrained to allow 𝑘𝐷 to be treated as a fitting parameter simultaneously 
to 𝐺∞.  However, the average values of 𝑘𝐷 obtained during fitting do not deviate in a 
systematic manner from the estimates obtained from comparison to the solid state (given in 
the supplementary material).  The approach taken here, of fixing 𝑘𝐷 at the average value 
across the isochores, then rerunning the calculations at this fixed value is therefore 
appropriate. 

2.  The infinite-frequency shear modulus 𝐺∞ to be fitted.  When the calculations are performed 
with 𝑘𝐷 fixed at an appropriate value, the best-fit value of 𝐺∞ increases slightly upon density 
increase as expected.  In reality the value of 𝐺∞ would vary slightly along the isochore, and 
this may be the reason why the model can struggle to cover a very large temperature range 
in a single calculation or to run at temperatures very close to the triple point.  However, 
since experimental measurements of 𝐺∞ across a wide 𝑃, 𝑇 range are not available 
accounting for any variation in the value of 𝐺∞ along the isochore would necessitate adding 
at least one more fitting parameter.  This is probably not possible without the fit becoming 
too poorly constrained.  The values of 𝐺∞ obtained during fitting are slightly too high.  For 
instance, from MD simulations summarized in ref. 4 we would expect 𝐺∞ ≈ 0.5 GPa in liquid 
Ar in the subcritical regime.  The values of 𝐺∞ obtained in our calculations on fluid Ar ranged 
from 2.4 GPa – 4.8 GPa.  In addition, the variation as a function of density seems too high for 
N2 (see table 2).  These discrepancies are reasonable given that the phonon theory of liquid 
thermodynamics is an approximate treatment (unavoidably so since it is based on the Debye 
model for solids, which is itself not exact). 

3.  The anharmonicity parameter λ.  The rationale for setting this to 0 or 0.5 was outlined 
earlier.  We observe that the fit quality is only weakly dependent on λ.  We therefore 
conclude that, at least for the fluids studied here, the Grüneisen approximation (that the 
pressure and temperature dependence of vibrational frequencies can be incorporated into 
the volume dependence, leading to 𝜆 = 0) could be used throughout for simplicity. 

4.2 Do the findings provide evidence that the model is correct? 

Generally, for a physical model to have any value it must be a model which could fail to fit the 
experimental data if it were wrong – as opposed to a model which automatically fits the data due to 
the number of adjustable parameters.  The phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics unavoidably 
has a sufficient number of adjustable parameters such that it can always be made to fit the data 
because very few direct measurements of Frenkel’s liquid relaxation time are available, and these 
measurements do not cover a wide 𝜌, 𝑇 range. 

However, what we have shown here is that the phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics could have 
failed in a multitude of ways were it not correct.  The model could have required 𝐺∞ and/or 𝑘𝐷 to 

20 

 
 
 
exhibit physically unrealistic values or the wrong trend as a function of density in order to fit the 
data.  It did not.  On the contrary, the model constrains 𝐺∞ to a narrow range of values of the 
correct order of magnitude exhibiting the correct trend on increasing density.  The model could have 
required the value of 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 to depart by orders of magnitude from what is expected from an 
estimation using the Maxwell relaxation time.  It did not. 

Eq. (5) has been utilized in previous works with the Maxwell relaxation time (a macroscopic property 
of the fluid) and with the Frenkel relaxation time (defined on an atomic level).  From the results 
presented here, it seems that the model can only be used with the Frenkel relaxation time if it stays 
close to the Maxwell relaxation time. 

It is also appropriate to briefly discuss the application of the model to quantum liquids.  The terms 
“quantum liquid” and “classical liquid” can have different meanings in different contexts.  Our model 
has been applied to liquids which are classical and quantum in the sense of the condition relevant to 
Eq. (7) (a classical liquid defined as one for which ħ𝜔 ≪ 𝑘𝐵𝑇 for all excitations).  However, we have 
not yet applied it to liquids which are genuinely quantum (the particle de Broglie wavelength is 
comparable to the dimensions of the box occupied by each particle and the number of quantum 
states available for the system does not vastly exceed the number of particles)4.  Only H2 and He at 
low temperatures meet these criteria. 

4.3 Can the model be used for a priori prediction of liquid heat capacity or other properties? 

We observe that tiny changes to 𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝, often so small that they could be caused by variation of the 
measured viscosity within experimental error, can change the predicted heat capacity trend on 
increasing temperature from one which is completely incorrect to one which fits the data closely.  
Therefore, whilst reproducing known liquid heat capacities is a nice test of the model it would be 
unwise to use it to predict heat capacity in the absence of experimental data.  On the other hand, if 
𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 and hence the viscosity are very tightly constrained by the observed heat capacity then a 
reformulation of the model to predict viscosity a priori using the observed heat capacity data could 
be possible in the future.
