1. Introduction

The long-lived isotope of argon, 42Ar, is a potential background source in

argon-based low background detectors. The isotope undergoes a beta decay

with a half-life of 32.9 years and the beta decay of its daughter isotope, 42K,

has the maximum electron energy of 3.52 MeV. The decay scheme is shown in

Figure 1. The potential background problem from 42Ar was ﬁrst identiﬁed by

the ICARUS experiment [1, 2]. Ray Davis pointed out that a signiﬁcant amount

of 42Ar could be formed in the Earth’s atmosphere due to nuclear weapon tests
in the upper atmosphere carried out at the end of the 1950s−beginning of the

1960s [3].

Estimates of the 42Ar concentration in atmospheric argon were carried out

in 1995 using the available information on nuclear tests [4, 5]. During such tests

42Ar can be produced via a two-step neutron capture reaction:

40Ar(n,γ)41Ar (1)

41Ar(n,γ)42Ar (2)

The above mechanism of 42Ar production requires a very high neutron ﬂux,

the condition fulﬁlled during nuclear tests in the upper atmosphere. In addition,
the half-life of 41Ar is suﬃciently long (T1/2 = 1.83 h) in comparison with a

typical time of a nuclear explosion (of the order of milliseconds) to allow an

eﬃcient production of 42Ar. It was shown that the maximum concentration of
42Ar caused by nuclear tests is of the order of ∼ 10−22 −10−23 atoms 42Ar/atom
40Ar. An alternative mechanism of 42Ar production was suggested in 1997 [6]

leading to a substantially higher level of the isotope content in the atmosphere.

In this mechanism 42Ar is produced by cosmic ray interactions in the upper

atmosphere via the reaction 40Ar (α,2p) 42Ar. The corresponding 42Ar/40Ar
ratio was estimated to be ∼ 10−20 atoms 42Ar/atom 40Ar.

The ﬁrst experimental limit on the content of 42Ar in atmospheric argon
was obtained in 1992, < 10−18 atoms 42Ar/atom 40Ar [7]. Later on, a more

sensitive estimate came from the DBA experiment that ran in the Gran Sasso

Underground Laboratory during 1995-2000 [8, 9]. The primary goal of the

2

experiment was the search for the double beta decay of 100Mo using a liquid

argon ionization chamber. The ﬁrst limit on the 42Ar content was obtained
from a partial data set, < 6 · 10−21 atoms 42Ar/atom 40Ar [10], followed by an
updated limit from the full data set, < 4.3 · 10−21 atoms 42Ar/atom 40Ar at

90% C.L. [9]. It should be noted that a surplus of events above the expected

background was observed in the DBA experiment in a single electron energy

spectrum. However, due to multiple other sources that can contribute to this

event topology it was diﬃcult to attribute these events to 42Ar. A conservative

approach was therefore adopted and only an upper limit established.

More recently, the GERDA-I experiment carried out an independent mea-

surement of the 42Ar concentration [11]. The aim of the experiment is to search

for the neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) of 76Ge. The experimental sig-

nature of 0νββ is a peak at the Q-value of the decay (2039 keV). The isotope

of 42K is therefore a potential background source for this experiment.

GERDA-I started data taking in 2011. High-purity germanium (HPGe) de-
tectors were immersed directly in a vessel with ∼ 90 tons of liquid argon. The
1525 keV gamma line from 42K was used to estimate the 42Ar content. The

interpretation of the observed count rate in terms of the 42Ar concentration de-

pends crucially on the assumption of the spatial distribution of 42K ions. It was

shown previously (see for example [13]) that positive 42K ions are preferentially
formed as a result of the 42Ar β− decay. Their spatial distribution in liquid

argon is determined by the electric ﬁeld conﬁguration in the detector. A high
voltage of ∼ 4 kV is typically applied to HPGe detectors. As a result, 42K ions

drift in the electric ﬁeld and are accumulated in the vicinity of the detectors

leading to a higher counting rate around the 1525 keV gamma line than that

expected from a uniform distribution of 42K in liquid argon.

The GERDA collaboration carried out a thorough study of the inﬂuence

of the electric ﬁeld on the level of background and methods of its reduction.

Thin-walled copper containers, mini-shrouds, were constructed around HPGe

detectors to isolate them from the main liquid argon volume.

It resulted in

a signiﬁcant reduction of the background in the 0νββ region and allowed the

3

42Ar concentration in liquid argon to be estimated, giving a range of (7 − 12) ·
10−21 atoms 42Ar/atom 40Ar [11] 1. Although this value is higher than the

limit obtained in [9], it is worth noting that, within errors, the observed eﬀect

corresponds to the excess seen in the DBA detector. The new analysis of the

DBA single electron events presented here has been triggered by the GERDA-I

result.

2. Updated DBA result on 42Ar concentration

The data obtained in the DBA experiment [9] have been reanalyzed to esti-

mate the 42Ar content in the Earth’s atmosphere. The detector was located in

the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory at a depth of 3500 m of water equiva-

lent. The experimental setup consisted of a liquid Ar ionization chamber (Fig.

2) placed in a 15 cm lead passive shielding, an Ar puriﬁcation and delivery sys-

tem, readout electronics and a data acquisition system. The ﬁducial part of the

detector is composed of alternating circular planes of anodes and cathodes with

Frisch screening grids placed between them. The cathodes are made of a molyb-

denum foil approximately 50 mg/cm2 thick. The chamber contains 14 cathodes,

15 anodes and 28 screening grids. The grid-anode distance is 5.5 mm and the

grid-cathode is 14.5 mm. The ﬁducial volume diameter is 30 cm and its height

is 56 cm. Each anode is connected to a charge-sensitive preampliﬁer, followed

by an ampliﬁer and a shaper. Shaped and unshaped signals are digitized by two

8-bit ﬂash ADC with a 50 ns sampling time. Unshaped pulse analysis provides

spatial information of the events. The trigger for data collection requires that
at least one anode signal exceeds the threshold (∼ 600 keV). The trigger causes

1The GERDA low-background test facility LArGe was also used to study the 42Ar back-
ground. Its concentration was found to be (2.2 ± 1.0) · 10−21 atoms 42Ar/atom 40Ar. The
assumption of a uniform distribution of 42K in liquid argon was used [12]. The eﬀect of the

electric ﬁeld from PMTs immersed in the liquid argon volume was not taken into account in
the estimation. Consequently, the 42Ar concentration could have been underestimated, which

was mentioned in [12]).

digitized signals from all anodes to be recorded. A more detailed description of

the experiment can be found in [9].

During the data taking period the electric ﬁeld was 1.9 kV/cm in the cathode-

grid gap and 4 kV/cm in the anode-grid gap. The detector energy scale was

calibrated using 22Na (Eγ = 1275 keV) and 88Y ((Eγ = 1836 keV) radioactive
sources (see description in [9]). The energy resolution of the chamber was ∼ 6%

(FWHM) at the 0νββ transition energy of 100Mo, 3 MeV.

A single electron signature is used to select candidate events from 42K decays.

This signature requires a single energy deposition detected on one of the anodes

with no signals on all other anodes. The 3.0-3.5 MeV energy interval of the

single electron spectrum accumulated over 2706 hours is used to determine the

42Ar concentration in liquid argon.

The new analysis of the experimental data has shown a small shift in the

energy scale of the calibration spectra that was unaccounted for in the original

analysis. A 5th-degree polynomial is used to ﬁt the high energy edge of the

Compton spectrum. The inﬂection point of the ﬁtting function corresponds to

the maximum energy of Compton electrons. However, multiple interactions of γ

rays in a single cathode-grid volume shift the inﬂection point to higher energies.

This eﬀect is illustrated in Figure 3.

Decays of 208Tl from materials surrounding the detector are used as an ad-

ditional point of the energy calibration that takes into account multiple gamma-

ray interactions in a single cathode-grid gap. Figure 4 shows the ﬁt of simulated

208Tl events in materials surrounding the ﬁducial volume of the detector to the

experimental single energy spectrum around 2381.76 keV. This energy corre-

sponds to the maximum energy of Compton electrons from the 2614 keV line of

208Tl.

The energy scale correction has been applied to the single electron energy

spectrum, which is shown in Figure 5.

MC simulations have been carried out to evaluate the detection eﬃciency in

the 3.0-3.5 MeV energy interval for two possible distributions of 42K in liquid

argon. In the ﬁrst case, positive ions of 42K created in the β decay of 42Ar are

assumed to maintain their charge for a suﬃciently long time to be transported

to negatively charged cathodes of the detector and undergo their β decay from

there, as was shown in [13]. In the second case, a uniform distribution of 42K in

the liquid argon volume of the detector is assumed. The eﬃciency is calculated

to be 0.87% and 1.07% in the ﬁrst and second case respectively. The calcula-

tions below assume the accumulation of positive 42K ions on negatively charged

cathodes of the chamber. However, a uniform distribution of neutral 42K atoms

in the detector volume will not alter the ﬁnal result by more than 15%. Re-

cently, EXO-200 reported the fraction of 214Bi+ ions in the 214Pb β decay (in
liquid Xe) to be (76.4 ± 5.7)%, while the remainder of 214Bi atoms are neutral
[14]. Assuming the same ratio of positive to neutral 42K atoms from the 42Ar

decay (in liquid Ar) the above eﬃciency is estimated to be 0.92%. Ultimately,

the uncertainty on the eﬃciency due to the distribution of the 42K ions in the

volume of the liquid argon detector is included in the systematic uncertainty on

the 42Ar concentration calculated below.

Table 1 shows possible other contributions to the single electron events in

the 3.0-3.5 MeV energy interval which are treated as background for the 42Ar

measurement. The contribution from nγ reactions are evaluated by extrapo-

lating the ﬂat part of the spectrum at high energies down to lower energies.

The external background from 214Bi is estimated using the available informa-

tion about the radiopurity of titanium (< 30 mBq/kg), which was the primary

material of the detector vessel. The 208Tl external background is estimated by

ﬁtting the Compton edge of the single electron spectrum around 2400 keV (see

Figure 4), and evaluating its contribution to the single electron events in the

3.0-3.5 MeV energy region.

Limits obtained from screening measurements with low-background HPGe

detectors are used to constrain the background from the internal contamination

inside the molybdenum cathode foils (the speciﬁc activities of 208Tl and 214Bi

are < 1.6 mBq/kg and < 10 mBq/kg, respectively). Taking into account the

above background sources the contribution of 42Ar to the single electron events

observed in the 3.0-3.5 MeV interval over the period of data taking is estimated

is a relatively weak constrain on 208Tl in the Mo cathode foils (see Table 1).

Other sources of the systematic error include the energy scale calibration, the

42K ion distribution in liquid argon and its eﬀect on the detection eﬃciency.

The argon used in the detector had been produced ∼ 10 years before the
measurements were carried out. Thus, given the half-life of 42Ar (32.9 years)

the concentration of the isotope in the detector’s volume is 20% lower than that

in the Earth’s atmosphere.

Using the above parameters and accounting for the total ﬁducial Ar mass

of 52 kg, the concentration of 42Ar in the Earth’s atmosphere can be estimated
· 10−21 atoms of 42Ar/atom of 40Ar, which corresponds to the 42Ar
as 6.8+1.7

activity of 1.2+0.3
−0.5 µBq/m3 of air. This leads to a speciﬁc activity of freshly
produced liquid argon of 68+17
−32 µBq/kg, in agreement with the earlier GERDA-

I result [11]. We also note that the presented result is consistent with the

mechanism of 42Ar production suggested in [6].
