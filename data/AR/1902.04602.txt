Abstract

The present work revisits the problem of modelling the real gaseous detonation dynamics
at the macro-scale by simple steady one-dimensional (1D) models. Experiments of detona-
tions propagating in channels with exponentially expanding cross-sections were conducted in
the H2/O2/Ar reactive system. Steady detonation waves were obtained at the macro-scale, with
cellular structures characterized by reactive transverse waves. For all the mixtures studied, the
dependence of the mean detonation speed was found to be in excellent agreement with ﬁrst
principles predictions of quasi-1D detonation dynamics with lateral strain rate predicted from
detailed chemical kinetic models. This excellent agreement departs from the earlier experiments
of Radulescu and Borzou (2018) in more unstable detonations. The excellent agreement is likely
due to the much longer reaction zone lengths of argon diluted hydrogen-oxygen detonations at
low pressures, as compared with the characteristic induction zone lengths. While the cellular
instability modiﬁes the detonation induction zone, the detonation dynamics at the macro-scale
are arguably controlled by its hydrodynamic thickness. Near the limit, minor discrepancy is ob-
served, with the experimental detonations typically continuing to propagate to slightly higher
lateral strain rates and higher velocity deﬁcits.

1. Introduction

Real detonations in gases have been experimentally observed to travel at a speed smaller than
the ideal Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation speed by a velocity deﬁcit, due to the presence of
non-ideal eﬀects [1, 2]. These non-ideal factors include lateral ﬂow divergence, unsteadiness,
and momentum and heat losses [1]. Extensive eﬀorts have been made to quantitatively compare
the experimentally measured velocity deﬁcits and propagation limits with the theoretical predic-
tions made by relatively simple models, which build up on the classical one-dimensional (1D)
Zeldovich-von Neumann-Doering (ZND) model [3–16]. The multi-dimensional transient cellu-
lar structures, consisting of an intricate ensemble of interacting triple points, shear layers, and
transverse waves, of the real gaseous detonations, however, greatly complicate these attempts.

They give rise to substantial deviations from the classical 1D ZND detonation structures [2, 17].
A signiﬁcant question hence comes up that, can the extended ZND model, which neglects the
time varying cellular structures, be able to model the real detonation dynamics in the presence of
losses at the macro-scale? The present paper addresses this question.

This question has also been attempted in the past by investigating detonation propagation
in narrow tubes [8, 9, 11–15] and tubes with porous walls [18, 19]. The mean propagation
velocities of detonations under varied initial pressures as well as the propagation limits were
experimentally determined for various mixtures. Due to the lateral ﬂow divergence from the
growth of the viscous boundary layer on tube walls acting as a mass sink [4] or from the porosity
of the walls, streamlines in the steady reaction zone are diverged resulting in a globally curved
detonation front experiencing a velocity deﬁcit [20]. In narrow tubes, the boundary layer theory
of Fay [4] was adopted for evaluating the global lateral strain rate; while in porous tubes, where
constant ﬂow divergence was assumed, it was estimated from the permeability of the porous
wall by assuming a choked ﬂow [19]. The generalized ZND model with lateral strain was then
applied to model the detonation dynamics. The authors have found that, the experimentally
obtained detonation velocity deﬁcits and propagation limits are in generally good agreement with
the theoretical predictions, made with the steady ZND model for weakly unstable detonations,
which are characterized by regular cellular structures; while for the unstable detonations with
irregular cells, the agreement is poor. Nevertheless, a number of simplifying assumptions and
matching constants were made in these works for the predictions. Firstly, there exist limitations
in the unrealistic assumption of uniform ﬂow divergence for detonations in narrow and porous
tubes, as Chinnayya et al. [20] and Mazaheri et al. [21] have numerically demonstrated that
a curved detonation front with ﬂow divergence due to wall boundary layers or permeability is
not expected to have a unique curvature. Moreover, Fay-type models [8, 12–15] require the
empirical inputs of a speciﬁcally deﬁned value of pressure ratio (cid:15), and a particular length scale
for modelling the ﬂow divergence rate, whose impact on the predictions has not been evaluated.
All these factors thus potentially diminish the values of the comparisons in relevant works.

Very recently, Radulescu and Borzou [22] experimentally formulated a novel solution al-
lowing for making a meaningful comparison of the experimental results with theoretical mod-
els. Their experimental technique involved two exponentially shaped channels. The constant
logarithmic derivative of the cross-sectional area enabled detonations to propagate with a con-
stant mean front curvature in quasi-steady state at the macro scale. Two mixtures of diﬀerent
regularity were tested, i.e., the highly unstable one of C3H8/5O2 and weakly unstable one of
2C2H2/5O2/21Ar. Firstly, they showed that detonations in the exponential channels propagated
at a constant average speed, which was controlled by the magnitude of the lateral strain. Beyond
a critical value of lateral strain, detonations were not possible. Moreover, they compared the ex-
perimentally obtained relationship, between the detonation velocity deﬁcit and its front’s global
curvature, with the generalized ZND model in the presence of lateral strain rate. The predic-
tions made with the steady ZND model for the velocity deﬁcit disagreed with the experiments.
The less unstable 2C2H2/5O2/21Ar detonations showed better agreement between experiments
and the theoretical predictions than the more unstable detonations in C3H8/5O2. An interesting
question then arises that, can the extended ZND model better predict detonation dynamics of
much less unstable mixtures, in spite of the cellular structures? This becomes the objective of
the present work.

It is well known that argon-diluted 2H2/O2 detonations have the weakest one dimensional
(1D) instability among those typically investigated experimentally [17, 19] and have a very reg-
ular cellular structure. The chemical kinetics of H2 decomposition is also better known than for
2

hydrocarbons. Therefore, the present study aims to extend the above well-posed technique to
more stable mixtures of 2H2/O2/2.0Ar, 3.0Ar, 4.5Ar, and 7.0Ar, for the purpose of investigating
in detail the dynamics of very regular cellular detonations with a constant mean lateral strain rate
in exponentially diverging channels.

2. Experimental Details

The experiments were conducted in a 3.4-m-long aluminium rectangular channel with an
internal height and width of 203 mm and 19 mm, respectively. A sketch of the experimental set-
up is shown in Fig. 1, which is the same as that adopted by Radulescu and Borzou [22]. The shock
tube comprises three sections, a detonation initiation section, a propagation section, and a test
section. The mixture was ignited in the ﬁrst section by a high voltage igniter (HVI), which could
store up to 1000 J with the deposition time of 2 µs. Mesh wires were inserted in the initiation
section for promoting the formation of detonations. Eight high frequency piezoelectric PCB
pressure sensors (p1-p8) were mounted ﬂush on the top wall of the shock tube to record pressure
signals and then obtain the propagation speeds by using the time-of-arrival method. The test
section was equipped with two glass panels in order to visualize the detonation evolution process.
For the safety purpose of performing experiments at high initial pressures, the visualization glass
panels were alternatively replaced by aluminum ones.

Two diﬀerent polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) ramps, which enabled the cross-sectional area A(x)
of the channel to diverge exponentially with a constant logarithmic area divergence rate (K =
d(lnA(x))
), were adopted in the test section. Dimensions of the ramps are shown in Fig. 1b. The
dx
large ramp had the logarithmic area divergence rate of 2.17 m−1, while for the small one such
rate was 4.34 m−1. At the entrance, a protruded rounded tip was kept for minimizing the eﬀects
of shock reﬂection on the detonation front. The initial gap between the ramp tip and the top wall
of the channel is 23 mm in height. The height between the exponentially curved wall and the top
wall is given by ywall = y0eK x for x > 0 and by ywall = y0 otherwise.

The mixtures presently studied were stoichiometric hydrogen/oxygen with diﬀerent argon
dilution, i.e., 2H2/O2/2.0Ar, 3.0Ar, 4.5Ar, and 7.0Ar. Each of them was prepared in a separate
mixing tank by the method of partial pressures and was then left to mix for more than 24 hours.
The mixture was introduced into the shock tube through both ends of the tube at the desired
initial pressure with an accuracy of 70 Pa. Before ﬁlling with the test mixture in every single
experiment, the shock tube was evacuated below the absolute pressure of 90 Pa. A driver gas
of C2H4/3O2 separated by a diaphragm, as shown in Fig. 1a, was used in the initiation section
for low initial pressures, under which detonations of the test gas cannot be initiated successfully
before entering the test section. For visualizing the detonation evolution process along the expo-
nential ramp, a large-scale shadowgraph system was adopted by using a 2m×2m retro-reﬂective
screen with an incandescent ﬁlament light source of 1600 W Xenon arc lamp from Newport.
The resolution of the high-speed camera was 1152×256 px2 with the frame rate of 42049 fps or
42496 fps. The exposure time was set to 0.81 µs. Alternatively, a Z-type schlieren setup [23]
with a vertical knife edge was also utilized with a light source of 360 W. The resolution of the
high-speed camera was 384×288 px2 with the framing rate of 77481 fps and the exposure time of
0.44 µs. Note that the background of each shadowgraph and schlieren photograph in the present
study was appropriately removed and the images were post-processed.

3. Experimental Results

3.1. Propagation of 2H2/O2/2Ar detonations along the large ramp

The superimposed shadowgraph photos illustrating the evolution of diverging detonation
fronts along the large ramp for the mixture of 2H2/O2/2Ar, at an initial pressure of 14.8 kPa and
12.4 kPa, respectively, are shown in Fig. 2. The detonation propagated from left towards right.
The detonation front acquired a large number of small-sized cellular structures, and was notice-
ably curved with a characteristic curvature due to the cross-sectional area divergence. Within the
limited resolution of the photographs, transverse waves can be recognized starting from triple
points and extending backward downstream. One can also note that, as the cross section area
of the channel increases, new transverse waves were continuously generated and the average
transverse wave spacing appeared to remain constant. This suggests that the cell size remains
constant in the self-sustained propagation of diverging detonations along the ramp. The average
detonation cell size measured in Fig. 2a and b is approximately 17.0 mm and 21.0 mm, respec-
tively, which are found to be larger than the values of 10.5 mm and 13.5 mm obtained from the
Detonation Database [24] for the same initial pressures.

On the other hand, the theoretically expected arcs of curvature from the quasi-1D approxi-
mation, whose radius equals the reciprocal of the logarithmic area divergence rate K = 2.17m−1,
were obtained and compared with the real detonation fronts in experiments. These arcs of circles
with the radius of 1/K = 0.46m are denoted by the dashed red lines in Fig. 2. The comparison
shows that the detonation front’s global curvature is in very good agreement with that expected
by the quasi-1D approximation for designing the exponential geometry, despite some minor de-
viations near the end of the ramp. These small deviations, as a result of the error in the quasi-1D

where the eﬀective curvature K2D represents the curvature of the arc of a circle perpendicularly
intersecting both the exponential wall at the point (x, ywall) and the top wall as well.

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the mean curvature of detonation fronts shown in Fig. 2 as
well as for detonations in other mixtures from Borzou’s experiments [25]. The front curvature
was ﬁtted by using the least-squares method provided by SciPy. Results in Fig. 3 clearly show
that it takes a relaxation length scale for the initially planar detonation front (before entering the
ramp) evolving into the curved one due to the exponential geometry. For the large ramp, the
relaxation length is approximately 0.4 m, while approximately 0.2 m for the small one. After
the relaxation stage, detonations follow the evolution of the eﬀective curvature K2D and can be
reasonably assumed to obey a constant mean curvature in their propagation, in spite of the slightly
decreasing curvature recognized near the end of the ramps. It thus suggests the appropriateness
of the macro-scale quasi-1D approximation for detonations propagating inside these exponential
channels.

The detonation propagation process for other lower initial pressures, near the limit, is illus-
trated in the superimposed shadowgraph photos of Fig. 4. With the decrease of the initial pressure
for reducing the kinetic sensitivity of mixtures, detonation cells are considerably enlarged. The
triple-shock structure, comprising a Mach stem, an incident shock, and a transverse wave that
extends behind the detonation front, can now be clearly observed. One can also observe the con-
sumption of the unreacted induction zones behind the incident shock by the passage of transverse
waves, e.g., see Frame 15 through Frame 18 in Fig. 4b, implying the reactivity of these waves.
This type of reactive transverse wave has been investigated ﬁrst in detail by Subbotin [26] for the

marginal, weakly unstable detonations and subsequently reported in a series of numerical and
experimental works, e.g., Sharpe [27], Pintgen et al. [28], and Austin [29]. When the initial pres-
sure was further decreased to approach the failure conditions, below which detonations are not
possible, the reaction zone structure becomes very clear (Fig. 4c-e). These near-limit detonations
were able to travel successfully with only one reactive transverse wave, which is interpreted as
a transverse detonation [30], as can be easily seen from Fig. 4c to Fig. 4e. The main features of
the transverse detonation, as shown clearly in Fig. 5, are qualitatively similar to that documented
numerically by Gamezo et al. [30]. The transverse detonation, propagating transversely along
the large induction zone, is strong enough to burn almost all the material except for a thin tail
in the vicinity of the triple point [30]. The generation mechanism of this thin non-reactive tail
in the gap between the leading shock and the transverse detonation front has been clariﬁed as a
result of the low temperature of the mixture in an embedded double Mach reﬂection [30]. When
delineating the track of the triple point, one can readily obtain the single-headed detonation cell,
denoted by the red dashed line in Fig. 4c-e. Clearly, as the detonation propagated towards the
end, the detonation cell size considerably increased. An alternative explanation of the enlarging
cells is the stabilization mechanism proposed by Short et al. [31]. Clearly in these curved det-
onations, the growth of the detonation front’s area may be higher than the intrinsic transverse
instability growth rate, thus resulting in the single-headed detonation of continuously increasing
cell size without birth of any new transverse waves. At these near limit conditions, signiﬁcant
departures between the real detonation fronts and the arcs of circles of expected curvature in Fig.
4a-c can also be observed.

The locally averaged speeds both along the top and bottom curved walls were calculated from
the shadowgraph photos in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, with the distance between every two neighboring
frames divided by their time interval ∆t, and their proﬁles are shown in Fig. 6. The speed was
normalized by the ideal CJ detonation velocity calculated with the NASA chemical equilibrium
code CEA [32]. For calculating the speed along the curved wall, the arc length L12 of the wall

The results in Fig. 6a-g demonstrate that within the current resolution, the local speed proﬁles
show more signiﬁcant variations for detonations at lower initial pressures. Especially for the
critical detonations with one triple point, as shown in Fig. 6e-g, the local speed proﬁles exhibit
periodic ﬂuctuations, ranging from the maximum of 1.2 DCJ to the minimum of 0.5 DCJ. These
characteristic ﬂuctuations very well illustrate the periodic evolution of the lead shock inside the
cells. As the detonation propagated to the right end, the ﬂuctuation period increased, implying an
increasing length scale of the detonation cell. This is consistent with the ﬁnding from Fig. 4 that
the detonation cell size increased as a result of the diverging area for the near-limit detonations.
Noteworthy are the out-of-phase periodic velocity proﬁles measured along the top and bottom
walls, shown in Fig. 6e-g. This can be interpreted as a result of the alternation between the
strong Mach stem with relatively high speed and the weak incident shock of low velocity in the
detonation front of a single triple point. The global mean propagation speeds along the top wall
and bottom walls diﬀered by at most 3% of DCJ. Moreover, the running time average (of 5∆t)
of the top-wall local speeds has also been shown in Fig. 6h. It again illustrates that for initial
pressures well above the limit, detonations can be assumed to propagate in quasi-steady state at
a macro scale much larger than the cellular structure with a constant speed (e.g., see the proﬁles
of 14.8 kPa and 12.4 kPa).

For the critical pressure of 5.5 kPa, below which detonations were unable to propagate, six
experiments in total were repeated. It was found that three of them successfully propagated as
single-headed detonations while the rest three ﬁnally failed. This apparently stochastic behavior
near the limits has also been observed in studies on detonation diﬀraction [33, 34]. Any slightly
diﬀerent perturbations during the whole evolution process can sensitively impact the result of Go
or No-Go for detonation propagation in the critical pressure range. Figure 7 shows the failing
process of the critical detonation and correspondingly its speed proﬁles. Before the failure, it
was similar to that of the successful cases in the propagation mechanism of a single-headed
detonation. As the detonation proceeded, the trailing reaction front was gradually detached from

the leading shock and unreacted tongues were formed behind, with the transverse wave becoming
inert. Finally, the detonation failed with the complete detachment of the reaction front from the
leading shock (see Frame 28 in Fig. 7a), thereby resulting in the continuous decay of the shock,
which can be seen from the continuously decreasing speed in Fig. 7b. Of noteworthy is that no
distinctive transverse detonations were observed in the decoupled shock-ﬂame complex for the
failure case.

In addition, the average detonation cell size was also obtained from the shadowgraph photos
of each experiment, as illustrated in Fig. 8. It characterizes the relationship between the ratio of
the presently estimated cell size (λ) to previously reported cell size (λ0) [35, 36], and the mean
propagation speed, normalized by the ideal CJ value. Note that the relation of λ0 was given by
λ0(p) = 443.3p−1.39, which was ﬁtted from the data in the Detonation Database [24]. Also, it is
reasonable to assume these reported cell sizes for detonations with very limited or no velocity
deﬁcits, i.e., ideal CJ detonations. The results from Fig. 8 show that the normalized cell size
(λ/λ0) increases considerably when decreasing the mean propagation speed with respect to the
ideal CJ speed (D/DCJ), suggesting a strong dependence of the cell size on the detonation ve-
locity deﬁcit. This agrees with the ﬁnding of Ishii and Monwar [12] for detonations in narrow
channels of varied sizes. When the mean propagation speed further decreased to 0.8DCJ, deto-
nations started to be organized in a single-headed one, whose cell size was about 10∼15 times
larger than that of the ideal CJ detonation at the same initial pressure. Previous works proposed
the onset of single-headed spinning detonations as a criterion for propagation limits of detona-
tions in narrow tubes [37, 38]. Here, it further demonstrates the characterization of propagation
limits inside the exponentially diverging channel by a single-headed detonation, organized with
a distinctive transverse detonation.

3.2. Propagation of 2H2/O2/2Ar detonations along the small ramp

Experiments were also performed for detonations propagating along the small ramp of a
higher area divergence rate of K = 4.34m−1, i.e., double that of the large ramp. Visualization
of the reaction zone structures of detonations at varied initial pressures near the limit, as shown
in Fig. 9, enables us to make the following observations. At 10.3 kPa, detonations propagated
with two triple points, i.e., one pair of transverse waves, along the detonation front (Fig. 9a). Ev-
idently, these transverse shocks were reactive in burning the unburned gases behind the leading
shock, preventing the generation of signiﬁcant unreacted gas pockets [28, 29]. When the initial
pressure was decreased to approach the critical one of 8.1 kPa, a single-headed detonation fea-
turing a transverse detonation was formed, as is clearly illustrated in Fig. 9b and c. Below this
critical pressure, the leading shock was found to continuously detach from the trailing reaction
front with the transverse wave being inert, which can be seen from Fig. 9d. Since the average
speeds along the walls were measured to be only 0.5∼0.6 DCJ, detonations can thus be inter-
preted as ﬁnally failed at the initial pressure of 7.9 kPa in Fig. 9d. It is not clear if such case
along the small ramp with a much longer extended length in the stream-wise direction would
have been possible.

The global mean propagation speeds of 2H2/O2/2Ar detonations, measured along the top wall
in all the experiments of both ramps, are shown in Fig. 10 as a function of initial pressures. As a
result of the ﬂow divergence, experienced by detonations inside the cross-section area diverging
channels, the mean propagation speed is smaller than its ideal CJ detonation speed by a velocity
deﬁcit. These velocity deﬁcits increase with the rate of geometrical area divergence, as can
be easily concluded in Fig. 10 from the higher propagation speeds measured in the large ramp
experiments (K = 2.17m−1) than that of the small ramp (K = 4.34m−1) under the same initial
pressures. As the initial pressure is reduced, the deviation of the mean propagation speed from the
ideal CJ value becomes larger, implying a more signiﬁcant role of area divergence in impacting
detonations of lower initial pressures. Near the limit, such velocity deﬁcits can reach 20% ∼ 30%

of the CJ value. One more observation is the higher propagation limit pressure pc of detonations
along the small ramp. This can be interpreted as the consequence of more losses experienced by
detonations along the small ramp due to its larger lateral strain rate, thus giving rise to a higher
critical pressure.

3.3. Eﬀect of argon dilution

In the present study, experiments of detonations in stoichiometric H2/O2 mixtures with other
argon dilutions both along the large ramp and small ramp were also performed. It served the
purpose of both qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrating the inﬂuence of argon dilution
on detonation behaviors. The mixtures involved in this part are 2H2/O2/3.0Ar, 4.5Ar, and 7.0Ar,
corresponding to the argon dilution of 50%, 60%, and 70%, respectively. Figure 11 shows the su-
perimposed schlieren photographs illustrating the evolution of detonations, well above the limit,
along the large ramp for diﬀerent mixtures. The curved detonation fronts were uniformly tex-
tured with triple points, with transverse waves extending downstream behind the leading shock.
Again, cell sizes remain approximately constant in the exponentially diverging channel, under
initial pressures far away from the limit. Moreover, comparisons of these experimentally ob-
tained detonation fronts with arcs of the expected curvature from the quasi-1D approximation
were also made. The very good agreement between the real curved detonation fronts and the
theoretically expected arcs, denoted by the red dashed lines in Fig. 11, demonstrates the indepen-
dence of the detonation front’s global curvature on mixture compositions and initial pressures. It

is thus indicative of the fact that argon diluted H2/O2 detonations, well above the limit, propagate
in quasi-steady state at the macro-scale with a constant mean curvature.

The visualized cellular structures of near-limit detonations in mixtures of 2H2/O2/3.0Ar,
4.5Ar, and 7.0Ar show qualitatively the same behaviors as that of 2H2/O2/2.0Ar detonations.
For example, Fig. 12 gives the evolution process of detonations with one pair of triple-shock
structures in the mixture of 2H2/O2/4.5Ar at the initial pressure of 11.2 kPa.
It excellently
demonstrates the interactions between the very regular cellular structures, including the colli-
sion of transverse waves and their reﬂections from the walls. Due to the reactive portion of the
transverse shock, sweeping across the unburned induction zone behind the incident shock, no sig-

niﬁcant unreacted gas pockets were observed. The detailed propagation process of single-headed
detonations is illustrated in Fig. 13 for the mixture of 2H2/O2/3.0Ar. Prior to the formation of a
transverse detonation, some unburned gases can be observed behind the transverse wave in the
ﬁrst three frames, implying that this transverse shock was non-reactive and of weak type. The
transverse detonation occurred after the reﬂection of the inert transverse wave from the curved
wall, which can be seen from the frames of 90.3 µs through 116.1 µs in Fig. 13. This behavior
can be better observed in Fig. 14, showing the transition process between the non-reactive and
reactive transverse waves in near-limit detonations in the mixture of 2H2/O2/7.0Ar. The initially
reactive transverse wave decayed gradually and transitioned to a non-reactive transverse wave,
which could be seen from the frames of 64.5 µs through 141.9 µs (Fig. 14). After the reﬂection of
the non-reactive transverse wave from the bottom curved wall, considerable unreacted gases were
pinched oﬀ as pockets, e.g., see frames of 154.8 µs and 167.7 µs. The reﬂected transverse wave
again became reactive and rapidly transformed to a strong transverse detonation burning all of
the unreacted gases behind the leading shock. After the generation of the transverse detonation,
unreacted gas pockets were no longer produced. These observations conﬁrm Subbotin’s ﬁnding

of both reactive and non-reactive transverse waves existing in marginal detonations [26] and the
mechanism of forming unreacted gas pockets due to inert transverse waves [26, 27, 29, 30].

The relationships between the mean propagation speeds and initial pressures are shown in
Fig. 15 for detonations in these mixtures, along the two ramps. As the argon dilution increases,
detonations of the same initial conditions propagate with a larger velocity deﬁcit, and the critical
pressure pc also increases. This can be interpreted in terms of the gas sensitivity varying with the
increase in dilutions of argon. Mixtures with higher argon dilutions are the ones with reduced
reaction rates and chemical energy release rates, thus giving rise to larger velocity deﬁcits and
limiting pressures. Near the limit, the measured velocity deﬁcits can reach 20% ∼ 25% of the CJ
value, as is consistent with that of 2H2/O2/2Ar.

4. Discussion

4.1. Relaxation to quasi-steady state

The investigation of the entrance eﬀects in our experiments shown in Fig. 3 suggest that the
relaxation length scale for the wave to adopt a steady state was approximately on the order of
the inverse steady state curvature (i.e., the radius of curvature 1/K ), i.e., 1/2.17 = 0.46 m and
1/4.34 = 0.23 m, respectively for the two ramps investigated.

The relative non-importance of the entrance eﬀects is also borne out from the comparison
of the detonation speeds obtained in the ﬁrst and second half of the channel, shown in Fig. 16
for all the experiments performed. The very good consistency between the mean propagation
speeds averaged over the whole section and those over the latter half section further conﬁrms
the appropriateness of assuming the macro-scale quasi-steady detonations inside the exponential
channels.

In order to investigate whether the conclusion of short transient entrance eﬀects can be gen-
eralized, we have further analyzed the numerical results of Radulescu and Borzou [22] for dif-
ferent entrance heights. These new compiled results are shown in Fig. 17.
In both simula-
tions, a planar ZND detonation enters a diverging ramp with the constant divergence rate, i.e.,
¯K = K∆1/2 = 0.004. Two entrance heights are considered, 10∆1/2 and 1∆1/2, where ∆1/2 is the
half reaction zone length. Further details can be found in Ref. [22].

The evolution of the detonation front speed recorded along the straight bottom wall, as well
as its running time average, are shown in Fig. 17b and Fig. 17c, respectively. From the running
time average, it can be observed that it takes a length scale of approximately 200 (in the order
of 1/0.004 = 250) for detonations in both the long and short channels to achieve the quasi-
steady state, despite their diﬀerent entrance heights. In passing, one can also note that minor
acceleration eﬀects can be observed near the end of the channels, which is consistent with the
slightly smaller curvature found near the end of ramps in Fig. 3 - an indication of the limitation
of the quasi-1D assumption in the design of the exponential geometry previously discussed.

Moreover, results in Fig. 17d demonstrate that detonations in both the long and short channels
follow the same evolution behaviors, since their running time average speed proﬁles collapse very

It can thus be concluded that the entrance heights have no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
the evolution of detonations. The relaxation length scale appears to correlate well with the radius
of curvature dictated by the speciﬁc geometry.

the quasi-steady state evolution of curved detonations described by the theory of Geometrical
Shock Dynamics (GSD) [39, 40], which suggests that the relaxation time to steady state follows a
process of diﬀusion of curvature on the surface of the front controlled by a time scale proportional
to h2K, where h is the channel’s thickness. The quasi-steady GSD description requires that the
detonation be much thinner than the observation length scales (comparable to the channel height
h).
In our experiments, the detonation enters the curved channel when the channel height is
comparable with the reaction zone thickness and comes to a steady state very rapidly. This
steady state is then maintained by the constant logarithmic derivative of the channel height.

4.2. The generalized ZND model

For the steady, inviscid, reacting quasi-1D ﬂow behind the leading shock front of a detonation
wave, the governing equations can be expressed in the frame of reference attached to the shock
front as the following system of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) [41]

are the local Mach number, speciﬁc enthalpy of species i, and mixture speciﬁc heat at constant
pressure. For the detonation wave, the ﬂow behind the leading shock starts from being subsonic
and then accelerates towards the sonic condition due to the positive energy release of ˙σre. On
the other hand, the strain rate of ˙σA by the lateral ﬂow divergence plays the opposite eﬀect
of decelerating this ﬂow. As the ﬂow may eventually become supersonic, a singular behavior
would appear in Eqs. (4a)-(4c). The local balance of these two competing eﬀects, however, can
eﬀectively prevent this singular phenomenon by mathematically letting ˙σre = ˙σA happen at the
same point for u = c (M = 1). As a result, this so-called generalized CJ condition is satisﬁed
with the steady reaction zone solution smoothly passing through the sonic point [41]. With this
criterion, the simpliﬁed system of governing equations of Eq. (4) can be numerically solved.

The lateral strain rate experienced by the ﬂow in the detonation attached frame can be related
to two separate eﬀects in our experiments: the divergence of the ﬂow to boundary layers and that
due to an enlarging channel dimension [22]. Consider a curved detonation front ABCD in Fig.
18a, where x(cid:48), y(cid:48), z(cid:48) are the space coordinates under the shock-attached system. The incoming
ﬂow (along the x(cid:48) direction) across the shock diverges in both y(cid:48) and z(cid:48) directions, as shown in
Figs. 18b and c, respectively. The lateral ﬂow divergence behind the detonation can be related

Therefore, we can further obtain

Ke f f = KAD + KAB

(5d)

(5e)

which indicates that for the curved detonation front ABCD in Fig. 18a, its total curvature of Ke f f
includes two parts, one due to the ﬂow diverged in the y(cid:48) direction while the other one comes from
the z(cid:48) direction. Similarly, for the curved detonation in our exponential channels, its total ﬂow
divergence also includes two parts, the one from the geometrical divergence of the exponentially
diverging channel in the height direction and the other due to divergence of the ﬂow rendered by
the boundary layer growth on the channel side walls. The eﬀective curvature Ke f f , experienced
by detonations in the exponential geometry, can thus be expressed as

Ke f f = K + φBL

(6)

where K is the logarithmic area divergence rate of the geometry. For the large ramp, K = 2.17
m−1, while for the small one, K = 4.34 m−1. φBL represents the contribution of the boundary-
layer-induced losses from the channel width direction.

4.3. The experimental D(κ) curves

Instead of modelling the boundary-layer-induced lateral ﬂow divergence, Radulescu and Bor-
zou [22] directly evaluated this loss rate of φBL from experiments by analytically comparing the
experimental data of two ramps with two underlying assumptions: (1) detonations propagating
inside the exponentially diverging channel of diﬀerent expansion ratios have the same constant
φBL since the channel’s dimension of the width is unchanged; (2) for the same mixture, it has a
unique relation between the velocity deﬁcits and the losses. As a result, the eﬀective curvature
Ke f f of the global front can be calibrated by collapsing together the experimental D(κ) curves of
detonations in the large and small ramp experiments, and then the loss rate φBL due to boundary
layers can be derived [22]. Figure 19 shows the experimentally obtained D(κ) curves, character-
izing the relationships between the detonation velocity (normalized by the ideal CJ speed) and
the lateral ﬂow divergence, for all the mixtures involved in this study. Note that the abscissa is
the non-dimensional loss obtained by multiplying the curvature with the ZND induction zone

peak thermicity. It was calculated by using the Shock and Detonation Toolbox (SDToolbox) [42]
under Cantera’s framework [43] with the San Diego chemical reaction mechanism (Williams)
[44]. This normalization method is the same as that adopted by Radulescu and Borzou [22].
Moreover, theoretical works have demonstrated that, for a speciﬁc mixture, there exists a unique
relationship between the curved detonation velocity deﬁcit and the curvature normalized by the
induction zone length [41, 45, 46]. In Fig. 19, the graph in the right column is the collapsed
D/DCJ − Ke f f ∆i correlation, after calibrating the eﬀective curvature Ke f f from the D/DCJ − K∆i
curve in the corresponding left graph, by including the boundary layer eﬀects. In the work of
Radulescu and Borzou [22], the same unique value of φBL = 5.5 m−1 was found to permit col-
lapsing all data of two ramps in both mixtures of 2C2H2/5O2/21Ar and C3H8/5O2. However, the
present study found that φBL can be varied for diﬀerent mixtures, with 5.5 m−1 for 2H2/O2/2.0Ar
and 2H2/O2/3.0Ar, while 4.5 m−1 and 3.5 m−1 for 2H2/O2/4.5Ar and 2H2/O2/7.0Ar, respectively.
In the recent works of Kudo et al. [47] and Nakayama et al. [48, 49] of curved gaseous deto-
nations in rectangular-cross-section curved channels, they also obtained the meaningful char-
acteristic D(k) curves, which are the ﬁrst extension of the D(κ) theory experimentally from
condensed-phase detonations to gas-phase detonations. When the detonation cell size was small
enough, i.e., in the order of 0.1∼1.0 mm, they were able to obtain the curved detonations in
quasi-steady conditions. An interesting question that arises is why the boundary layer eﬀects can
be negligible in their works while appear to be signiﬁcant in the present work, since their channel
depth of 16 mm is in the same order with that of the current exponential channels. This can be
ﬁrst clariﬁed by the fact that the cell sizes of detonations in the present study are comparable to,
if not larger than, the channel width, while in works of Nakayama et al., the cell size is much
smaller. As a result, detonations of much longer characteristic reaction zones in the present ex-
periments experienced more signiﬁcant boundary-layer-induced losses. The other explanation
can be interpreted with the detonation loss induced by the geometry. The exponential-geometry-
induced mean front curvature in the present work has been found to be comparable to that due
to boundary layers. However, in works of Nakayama et al., the local curvature induced by the
geometry ranges from 20 ∼ 200 m−1 (evaluated from Fig. 7 of Ref. [48]), which is much larger
than the boundary-layer-induced loss rate estimated from current experiments. Therefore, as a
result of the diﬀerence between geometries and initial conditions, the boundary layer can play
the role of varied signiﬁcance.

4.4. Comparisons with the generalized ZND model
4.4.1. The ZND model predicted D/DCJ − Ke f f ∆i curves

To start with, the theoretically predicted relationship between the eﬀective curvature Ke f f
and the detonation speed has been obtained by solving the ODE system of Eq. (4), with the
developed custom Python code [22] working under the framework of SDToolbox and Cantera.
The San Diego reaction mechanism was applied for describing the realistic chemical kinetics.
These calculations were conducted at three initial pressures covering the experimental range.
Normalizing the varied divergence rates Ke f f by the ZND induction zone length ∆i at these
pressures permits getting the theoretical D/DCJ − Ke f f ∆i curves, which have been shown in
Fig. 19. These comparisons show that the experiments are generally in very good agreement
with the extended ZND model predictions for small and moderate lateral strain, except near the
limit. Detonations from experiments were able to propagate beyond the maximum lateral strain
predicted by the steady ZND model, with larger velocity deﬁcits, thus demonstrating the role

of cellular structures in enhancing the detonability of gaseous detonations [50]. The D/DCJ −
Ke f f ∆i characteristic relationships of both the experiments and ZND model predictions for all
the mixtures, as summarized in Fig. 20, demonstrate that detonations with less argon dilutions
can propagate with more losses. It is thus indicative of the eﬀects of argon dilutions in reducing
the detonability of H2/O2/Ar detonations, consistent with the computations by Klein et al. [41].

The eﬀects of argon dilutions in reducing the detonation detonability are more evident in Fig.
21, which illustrates the relationship between the initial pressures and the ZND model predicted
critical curvature κmax, above which detonations are not possible at a certain initial pressure. With
the reduction of the mixture sensitivity by lowering the initial pressure, the critical curvature also

Moreover, the results in Fig. 21 further demonstrate
that detonations in experiments can propagate with a larger critical curvature than that predicted
by the generalized ZND model, suggesting the higher detonability of real detonations in experi-
ments.

4.4.3. The ZND model predicted detonation speed as a function of initial pressures

Finally, the theoretically predicted detonation speed as a function of initial pressures has
also been calculated, as shown in Fig. 22 illustrating the comparisons of the experiments with
the predictions made with the real chemistry. Such ZND model predicted relationships were
obtained through three approaches for evaluating the boundary-layer-induced ﬂow divergence,
either directly from experiment, or by modeling the negative displacement thickness in the case
of turbulent or laminar boundary layers.
(1) The ﬁrst method assumed the constant boundary-layer-induced loss rate φBL, which has been
directly calibrated from experiments. The lateral strain rate ˙σA can thus be expressed as

˙σA = (Ds − u) (cid:0)K + φBL

(cid:1)

(7)

(2) According to Fay’s theory on boundary layer mechanism, its eﬀect can be modelled by in-
viscid ﬂow in a streamtube with a negative displacement of the boundary layer, as a result of the
boundary layer acting as a mass sink by removing the mass from the core ﬂow [4]. For the present
experimental conﬁguration, since the channel height is much larger than the channel width, the
boundary layer eﬀects on the top and bottom curved wall can be reasonably neglected. The ef-
fective width of the diverged ﬂow behind the detonation is thus given by w(x(cid:48)) = w + 2δ∗(x(cid:48)),
where δ∗(x(cid:48)) is the boundary layer negative displacement thickness . As a result, the rate of ﬂow
divergence due to the boundary layer growth on side walls can be evaluated as

In Fay’s work, he adopted Gooderum’s empirical turbulent boundary layer thickness relation [51]
as the displacement thickness behind the detonation wave. The relation is given by

where µe and ρ0 are the post-shock state viscosity and the initial density, respectively. This
turbulent boundary layer displacement thickness relation has then been applied in a large number
of subsequent works investigating detonation velocity deﬁcits [5, 6, 9, 11–15]. The boundary-
layer-induced ﬂow divergence rate is thus a function of the distance behind the leading shock.
Consequently, using this turbulent boundary layer displacement thickness relation, the lateral
strain rate ˙σA is

The comparisons in Fig. 22 show that the ZND model predictions, obtained with Fay’s tur-
bulent boundary layer displacement thickness relation and Mirels’ laminar boundary layer solu-
tions, both have the very close results. They can relatively well predict the experiments. And
surprisingly, they also appear to capture the near-limit detonation dynamics quite well, including
both the limit pressures and velocity deﬁcits. Moreover, we also estimated the Reynolds number
Re = (cid:0)ρsus/µs
(cid:1) xH, as shown in Fig. 23, for H2/O2/Ar detonations in large ramp experiments.
Note that ρs, us, and µs are the post-shock parameters, i.e., density, particle velocity (in the lab
frame reference), and viscosity, while xH is taken as the characteristic hydrodynamic thickness
between the leading shock and the CJ sonic surface. The results from Fig. 23 indicate that the
boundary layer behind H2/O2/Ar detonations is probably laminar, since the Reynolds number is
smaller than the critical one of Rec ≈ 0.5 × 106 ∼ 4.0 × 106 for the shock-induced boundary-
layer transition from laminar to be turbulent [51, 53–55]. This ﬁnding concurs with the previous
conclusion of Liu and Glass [56] and Damazo et al. [57] that the boundary layer behind stoi-
chiometric hydrogen/oxygen detonations is laminar. Therefore, Fay’s turbulent boundary layer
displacement thickness relation for evaluating the boundary-layer-induced ﬂow divergence is
questionable. It is not clear at present why this turbulent boundary layer assumption somehow
can work well for predicting the experiments.

On the other hand, it can also be clearly seen from Fig. 22 that the experiments are in excellent
agreement with the predictions, made with the constant boundary-layer-induced loss rate of φBL

well above the limit. While approaching the limit, these predictions deteriorate. Real detonations
can propagate at lower initial pressures, where the steady ZND model predicts failure. The ﬁrst
reason for this discrepancy near the limit can be attributed to the possible promotion mechanism
of strong reactive transverse waves, especially the transverse detonations, which help extend the
propagation limits to lower pressures than that predicted by the generalized ZND model neglect-
ing cellular structures. Secondly, the assumption of a constant global curvature for the leading
shock front, well above the limit, is not applicable to detonations near the limit, as can be con-
cluded from observations of the structures of detonation fronts at relatively low pressures, e.g.,
see Fig. 4. It thus results in failure of the theoretical predictions for these near-limit detonations
from experiments.

The observed diﬀerences between the ZND model prediction and experiments observed near
the limits may also be aﬀected by the enhanced instability of attenuated detonations with lower
shock temperatures and longer ignition delays compared to the reaction time scales. Radulescu
[19] introduced the parameter χ for characterizing the stability of detonations under diﬀerent
thermodynamic conditions. Detonations in mixtures of higher χ are more unstable to perturba-
tions in the reaction zones than those with lower χ. The mathematical expression of χ is

χ =

(cid:32)

Ea
RT s

(cid:33)

(cid:33) (cid:32) tig
tre

(13)

where Ea/RT s is the usual non-dimensional activation energy, T s is the temperature behind the
leading shock, R is the speciﬁc gas constant, and tig/tre is the ratio of ignition to reaction time.
Figure 24 shows, for all the mixtures, the relationships of these parameters as a function of
the leading shock velocity, normalized with the ideal CJ speed. Of noteworthy is that each
solid circle represents one experiment, and the shock speed corresponds to the experimentally
measured mean propagation velocity over the whole ramps. One can observe that decreasing
the detonation front speed by increasing the velocity deﬁcits results in the reduced post-shock
temperature, increased activation energy, and larger ratios of the ignition time relative to the
reaction time, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the reaction rates to relaxations in the reaction
zones. As such, detonations tend to become more unstable with increased χ. The considerable
increment of χ , however, occurs when the velocity deﬁcit is relatively large, especially near the
limit, as can be observed from Fig. 24d. It can thus be speculated that the signiﬁcantly increased
instability, as a result of considerably large velocity deﬁcits, leads to the incapability of the
extended ZND model to predict detonation dynamics at relatively low initial pressures near the
limit.

4.5. Why can the steady 1D ZND model predict the H2/O2/Ar cellular detonation dynamics?

The above analysis has quantitatively showed that the generalized ZND model with lateral
strain rate can predict very well the experiments of H2/O2/Ar cellular detonations, except some
departures for the near-limit detonation dynamics. The question that arises is what results in such
excellent predictability, given the detonation structure is always cellular.

A tentative answer comes from the analysis of the relevant length and time scales in the
detonation cellular structure. For hydrogen-oxygen-argon detonations, the induction time scales
and length scales are much shorter than the global reaction zone, as can be seen from the ZND
calculations of Fig. 25. 90% of energy release occurs at a distance an order of magnitude longer
than the induction zone thickness. Since the reaction zone is not thermally sensitive, spatial

of the maximum thermicity, as proposed by Radulescu [19]. They were calculated with the constant volume explosion at
the mean propagation speed with the real chemistry.

the reaction zone structure. Since the dynamics are controlled by the acoustic time over the whole
reaction zone structure, these are expected to be insensitive to the induction zone variations,
which are much faster. For hydrocarbon detonations studied by Radulescu and Borzou [22], the
opposite is true and the reaction zone thicknesses are much shorter as compared to the induction
zone thickness. For these mixtures, the ZND model fails to capture the dynamics.

5. Conclusion

In the present study, experiments of very regular cellular detonations, propagating inside the
exponentially diverging channels with two diﬀerent constant area divergence rates, were per-
formed in mixtures of stoichiometric H2/O2 of varied argon dilutions. The propagation charac-
teristics were demonstrated and analyzed in detail. The results showed that detonations, well
above the limit, were uniformly curved with small-sized cellular structures of constant cell sizes,
and can be reasonably assumed to propagate in quasi-steady state at the macro-scale with a con-
stant mean front curvature. The experimentally measured cell sizes showed a strong dependence
on the detonation velocity deﬁcits. When the mean propagation speed dropped to about 0.8DCJ,
detonations started to propagate in the mechanism of single-headed detonations, organized with
a distinctive transverse detonation, with the detonation cell size larger than the ideal one in the
order of 10 ∼ 15. The stabilization mechanism of single-headed detonations with saliently en-
larging cells suggests a higher growth rate of the curved detonation front area than that of the
intrinsic transverse instability. The Go/No-Go phenomenon has also been demonstrated for deto-
nations near the very limit, due to its stochastic property. Also, both the reactive and non-reactive
transverse waves were observed for detonations propagating at low pressures near the limit.

The experimental D/DCJ − Ke f f ∆i curves were obtained by collapsing the D/DCJ − K∆i re-
lationships of both the large ramp and small ramp. As a result, the equivalent loss rate φBL due to
boundary layers were directly derived. It was found that detonations of lower argon dilutions can
propagate with more losses, indicating the eﬀects of argon addition in decreasing the detonability
of H2/O2/Ar detonations. The same conclusion can also be drawn from the decrease of critical
curvature with the increasing argon dilutions. The variation of velocity deﬁcits with the ﬂow di-
vergence was found in very good agreement with the predictions made with steady ZND model
with lateral strain rate, for small and moderate divergence and velocity deﬁcits. Nevertheless,
the model under-predicted the limiting lateral strain and velocity deﬁcits for detonations near the
limit, thus illustrating the eﬀects of cellular structures in enhancing the detonability.

Furthermore, comparisons between the experimentally obtained average speeds and the gen-
eralized ZND model predictions were performed in terms of diﬀerent initial pressures. The
results showed that predictions made with the experimentally obtained constant loss rate φBL can
excellently predict the experiments, except some departures for the near-limit detonations. On
the other hand, the predictions made with Fay’s turbulent boundary layer displacement thickness
relation and Mirels’ laminar boundary layer solutions both can relatively well predict the experi-
ments. However, the estimated Reynolds number casts doubt on the turbulent boundary layer as-
sumption, while appears to support the ﬁnding that the boundary layer behind hydrogen/oxygen
detonations is laminar. Finally, the promotion eﬀects by the strong reactive transverse waves or
transverse detonations, the limitation of the quasi-1D assumption near the limit, and the consider-
ably increased instability were proposed for clarifying the discrepancies between the theoretical
predictions and experiments for the near-limit detonations. The much shorter induction zone
length and time scales as compared to the global reaction zone were proposed for clarifying the
31

predictability of the real H2/O2/Ar cellular detonation dynamics by the extended 1D ZND model
with lateral strain rate.

which has been investigated in detail in the 1950s by Mirels [52]. By assuming a laminar ﬂow

By solving the equations of Eq. (16a) and Eq. (18) under the framework of Cantera and
SDToolbox with the detailed San Diego reaction mechanism, we can obtain the Mirels’ factor
KM from Eq. (19b) for diﬀerent mixtures at varied initial pressures, which has been shown in
Fig. 27. It can be observed that the constant KM exhibits minor variations regarding the initial
pressures and the mixture compositions. Note that the present realistic calculations using Cantera
adopted the real thermodynamic data, while Mirels’ model assumed the viscosity to scale linearly
with temperature. Diﬀerences of the assumptions can introduce the variability of the evaluated
KM by approximately 20% to 30%, when evaluating boundary layers behind detonations. In
the present work, we adopt KM = 4.5 for evaluating the laminar boundary layer displacement
thickness [58, 59].
