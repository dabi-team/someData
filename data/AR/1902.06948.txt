ABSTRACT

Understanding elemental abundance variations in the solar corona provides an insight into how matter and
energy ﬂow from the chromosphere into the heliosphere. Observed variations depend on the ﬁrst ionization
potential (FIP) of the main elements of the Sun’s atmosphere. High-FIP elements (>10 eV) maintain photo-
spheric abundances in the corona, whereas low-FIP elements have enhanced abundances. Conversely, inverse
FIP (IFIP) refers to the enhancement of high-FIP or depletion of low-FIP elements. We use spatially resolved
spectroscopic observations, speciﬁcally the Ar XIV/Ca XIV intensity ratio, from Hinode’s Extreme-ultraviolet
Imaging Spectrometer to investigate the distribution and evolution of plasma composition within two conﬁned
ﬂares in a newly emerging, highly sheared active region. During the decay phase of the ﬁrst ﬂare, patches
above the ﬂare ribbons evolve from the FIP to the IFIP effect, while the ﬂaring loop tops show a stronger FIP
effect. The patch and loop compositions then evolve toward the pre-ﬂare basal state. We propose an explanation
of how ﬂaring in strands of highly sheared emerging magnetic ﬁelds can lead to ﬂare-modulated IFIP plasma
composition over coalescing umbrae which are crossed by ﬂare ribbons. Subsurface reconnection between the
coalescing umbrae leads to the depletion of low-FIP elements as a result of an increased wave ﬂux from be-
low. This material is evaporated when the ﬂare ribbons cross the umbrae. Our results are consistent with the
ponderomotive fractionation model (Laming 2015) for the creation of IFIP-biased plasma.

1. INTRODUCTION

Elemental abundance variations are tracers of physical pro-
cesses throughout the Universe, with the cosmic reference
standard being the solar chemical composition. Understand-
ing how the Sun’s chemical composition varies in time and
space provides an insight into how mass and energy ﬂow
from the Sun’s chromosphere into the heliosphere and in

turn, from the chromospheres of solar-like stars into their as-
trospheres (e.g., Testa 2010; Testa et al. 2015; Laming 2015).
From over 50 years of spectroscopic observations we
know that the solar corona has different elemental com-
position from that of the photosphere (Pottasch 1963; Meyer
In the corona, elements of low ﬁrst ionization

potential (FIP; ≤ 10 eV) such as Fe, Si, Mg, and Ca are
enhanced by a factor of two to four compared to their pho-
tospheric abundances. This is known as the FIP effect and
it is typically expressed in terms of the FIP bias parameter
which is the ratio of an element’s coronal and photospheric
abundances. The enhancement of low-FIP elements varies
depending on the coronal structure, e.g., coronal holes show

little plasma fractionation (FIP bias ∼1 or photospheric com-
position; Feldman & Widing 1993; Feldman et al. 1998;
Doschek et al. 1998; Brooks & Warren 2011; Baker et al.
2013), quiet-Sun regions typically have a FIP bias of 1.5–
2 (Feldman & Widing 1993; Doschek et al. 1998; Warren
1999; Baker et al. 2013; Ko et al. 2016; Baker et al. 2018),
whereas active regions (ARs) consist of highly fractionated
plasma with FIP bias of 3–4 (Feldman 1992; Widing & Feld-
man 1995; Sheeley 1996; Brooks & Warren 2011, 2012;
Baker et al. 2013; Del Zanna & Mason 2014; Baker et al.
2015; Brooks et al. 2015). (See reviews by e.g., Feldman &
Widing (2003); Schmelz et al. (2012); Laming (2015) and
Chapter 14 of Del Zanna & Mason (2018)).

Unresolved Sun-as-a-star observations using full disk in-
tegrated spectra show the solar FIP effect of the active Sun.
For temperatures greater than ∼1 MK, Laming et al. (1995)
found low-FIP elements were enhanced by a factor of 3–4
which is in line with the FIP bias value for the element Fe de-
duced by Schonfeld et al. (2015). The FIP effect is reduced
at lower temperatures (Laming et al. 1995). Recent work of
Brooks et al. (2017, 2018) based on Sun-as-a-star spectra ob-
tained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Extreme-
Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) demonstrated that
the variation of coronal composition is highly correlated with
the solar cycle.

The coronae of solar-like stars exhibit a varying degree of
the solar-like FIP effect in their X-ray spectra whereas more
active cool dwarf stars show an inverse FIP (IFIP) effect. In
surveys of M dwarf stars and active binaries, low-FIP ele-
ments are under-abundant relative to high-FIP elements e.g.,
O, Ne, Ar (e.g., Brinkman et al. 2001; Telleschi et al. 2005;
Robrade & Schmitt 2005; Argirofﬁ et al. 2005; Robrade &
Schmitt 2006; Wood & Linsky 2006; Liefke et al. 2008;
Wood et al. 2012). Wood & Linsky (2010) ﬁrmly established
the dependence of the (I)FIP effects on F to K spectral type
stars with X-ray luminosity <1029 ergs s−1. The solar FIP
effect decreases from G to early K-type stars and becomes
zero at ∼ K5 then reverses to the IFIP effect for later K stars
and M dwarfs. Wood et al. (2018) extended the FIP bias–
spectral type relationship to include stars of earlier spectral
types A and F. It is worth noting that the observed compo-
sition of stellar coronae can be more complex than having
either a straightforward FIP or IFIP effect. For example,
Peretz et al. (2015) found that all elements were consistently
depleted in the coronae of six main sequence stars of spec-
tral type F7–K1 compared to their respective photospheres,
whether compared to solar abundances or the individual stel-
lar abundances.

Surveys of plasma composition in solar ﬂares show no-
table variability in elemental abundances. Warren (2014)
measured absolute abundances for 21 M9.3 to X6.9 class
ﬂares using SDO/EVE spectra. The mean FIP bias in their

sample is close to photospheric composition which is con-
sistent with the earlier results of Veck & Parkinson (1981);
Feldman & Widing (1990); McKenzie & Feldman (1992)
and more recently with Del Zanna & Woods (2013). How-
ever, in large samples of solar ﬂares observed by multiple
instruments, low-FIP element abundances are enhanced by
a factor of ∼2–3, depending on the emission lines and in-
struments used to determine the FIP bias, the atomic data
used at the time of the measurements, and temperature ef-
fects (e.g., Doschek et al. 1985; Sterling et al. 1993; Bent-
ley et al. 1997; Fludra & Schmelz 1999; Phillips & Dennis
2012; Dennis et al. 2015; Sylwester et al. 2015). Spatially
resolved ﬂare observations from Hinode/EIS provide clues
to understanding the abundance variability observed in solar
ﬂares. Doschek et al. (2018) show that the FIP bias varies
from coronal composition in the post-ﬂare loops to photo-
spheric composition in the loop footpoints for an X8.3 ﬂare
and Warren et al. (2018) ﬁnd coronal abundances in the cur-
rent sheet of the same limb ﬂare. At least for the solar case,
it is possible that the spatially unresolved observations (e.g.,
Warren 2014) show little FIP effect in ﬂares because photo-
spheric abundances are dominant and the coronal composi-
tion of speciﬁc features such as post-ﬂare loops is only evi-
dent in spatially resolved images.

Studies of abundance changes in stellar ﬂares have been
mainly limited to large ﬂares on active stars i.e., to stars with
IFIP composition. Using high resolution X-ray spectroscopy,
Nordon & Behar (2007, 2008) analyzed abundance variations
during 14 large ﬂares observed by the XMM-Newton and
Chandra observatories. In 7 of 14 ﬂares, they found a trend
of enhanced low-FIP elements tending towards photospheric
composition during the ﬂares for stars with IFIP-biased qui-
escent coronae. The opposite trend was observed in two
stars with FIP–bias dominated plasma comprising their coro-
nae and ﬁve stars showed no effect during ﬂaring. Their re-
sults are consistent with case studies of solar-like stars (e.g.,
Testa et al. 2007), active M dwarf EV Lac (Laming & Hwang
2009), active M dwarf CN Leo (Liefke et al. 2010), and RS
CVn binary stars (e.g., G¨udel et al. 1999; Audard et al. 2001,
2003). Indeed, our knowledge is presently limited for ﬂares
in stars because of the difﬁculties in determining abundance
variations in stellar coronae; see the extensive discussion in
Testa (2010).

Any theoretical framework for a fractionation mechanism
must be able to account for all of the solar and stellar ob-
servations including the IFIP effect. Early models based
on, for example, thermal diffusion and Coulomb drag could
reproduce some observational aspects of the FIP effect but
not those of the IFIP effect (Laming 2015, and references
therein). To date, only the ponderomotive force model is able
to produce IFIP composition. The Laming model invokes
the ponderomotive force acting only on ions to separate ions

from neutrals in the chromosphere of the Sun and other stars
(Laming 2012, 2015, 2017). Fractionation takes place in the
chromosphere at temperatures where low-FIP elements are
mainly ionized, but high-FIP elements remain neutral. The
ponderomotive force arises as Alfv´en waves reﬂect from or
refract at the high density gradient in the chromosphere of
the Sun. Alfv´en waves originating in the corona cause FIP
fractionation at the chromospheric level at loop footpoints
which are magnetically connected to reconnection sites of
ﬂares or nanoﬂares (Laming 2017). Conversely, upwardly
directed photospheric acoustic waves may mode convert to
fast mode waves as the plasma transitions from β >1 to β
<1, where plasma β is the ratio of plasma pressure and mag-
netic pressure. The IFIP effect arises as these new fast mode
waves refract in the chromosphere back down again, produc-
ing a downward directed ponderomotive acceleration (Lam-
ing 2015).

Recently, Doschek et al. (2015) reported the ﬁrst obser-
vations of the IFIP effect on the Sun. Highly localized re-
gions of IFIP were captured by Hinode/EIS (Culhane et al.
2007) near large sunspots during ﬂares (Doschek et al. 2015;
Doschek & Warren 2016, 2017). In the most extreme case,
the IFIP effect locally exceeded that of the integrated value
of M dwarf stars of spectral type ∼M5 at the extreme end
of the FIP bias-spectral type relationship of Wood & Linsky
(2010); Laming (2015); Wood et al. (2018).

In this paper, we present a detailed spectroscopic study of
the evolution of plasma composition in the very active AR
11429. We ﬁnd that patches of IFIP bias plasma appear and
disappear within the FIP-bias dominated composition of the
AR during a conﬁned ﬂare, while IFIP–bias plasma was not
observed in another conﬁned ﬂare nine hours later. We dis-
cuss how the relatively rare magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of
the AR and its evolution relate to the spatial locations and
temporal evolution of IFIP patches and we consider whether
ﬂaring plays a role in creating the anomalous plasma compo-
sition or simply reveals the already present IFIP plasma.

2. OVERVIEW OF AR 11429

2.1. Coronal Activity

AR 11429 appeared at the NE limb on 2012 March 3. Dur-
ing its disk transit, AR 11429 was the source region of three
X-class, 14 M-class, 32 C-class ﬂares and four coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), making it one of the most ﬂare and CME
productive active regions of Solar Cycle 24. The high activ-
ity level and rare magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration have inspired a
large number of studies of the active region (e.g. Petrie 2012;
Donea & Hanson 2013; Sun et al. 2015; Chintzoglou et al.
2015; Syntelis et al. 2016; Patsourakos et al. 2016; Polito
et al. 2017). In this study, we focus on two conﬁned M-class
ﬂares observed by Hinode/EIS on March 6. They are iden-
tiﬁed as FL1 and FL2 in the GOES 1–8 ˚A X-ray ﬂux curve

in Figure 1. The ﬁrst ﬂare starts at 12:23 UT, peaks at 12:37
UT, and decays to background ﬂux levels by ∼13:45 UT and
the second ﬂare begins at 21:04 UT, peaks at 21:12 UT and
quickly decays by ∼21:25 UT. FL1 and FL2 ﬂare classiﬁca-
tions are M2.2 and M1.4, respectively.

2.2. Coronal Evolution

The pre-ﬂare coronal conﬁguration of AR 11429 was a
highly sheared structure. The hot-channel passbands e.g., 94
˚A and 131 ˚A of the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmo-
spheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA; Lemen et al. (2012))

horizontal segment of the PIL in the SW of the AR. Ribbon
pair R1–R2 appears ∼1 min before R3–R4. They are bright-
est at the ﬂare peak (12:37 UT in Figure 2) and gradually
decrease in intensity during the decay phase.

There was continuous, low-level reconﬁguration of the
corona in the period between the two ﬂares when the main ac-
tivity shifted to the vicinity of the ribbon pair R3–R4 of ﬂare
FL1, along the horizontal portion of the PIL. At 20:43 UT,
brightenings begin to reappear in SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A passband
in the NE section of the AR while the main activity continues
in the SW (see included movie Movie 1.mp4). The ribbons
have faded in the NE by 21:06 UT, at the same time that FL2
begins in the vicinity of the former ribbons R3–R4. We ob-
serve highly packed ribbons over the magnetically complex
horizontal PIL during the rise phase. Activity continues in
the central part of the AR throughout the decay phase of FL2.

2.4. Magnetic Field Evolution

When AR 11429 rotated onto the disk on 2012 March 3, it
was already a mature sunspot group containing several um-
brae in a common penumbra. The magnetic structure of the
AR was bipolar, with an anti-Hale orientation for the N hemi-
sphere (Figure 3, continuum image at 22:10 UT on March
3). The orientation of the bipolar ﬁelds also deviated signif-
icantly from Joy’s law (Hale et al. 1919). Over the next few
days, major ﬂux emergence took place along the AR’s inver-
sion line, with the opposite-polarity new ﬂux concentrations
diverging at roughly a right angle to the line connecting the
pre-existing spots. By March 6, the magnetic structure be-
came αβγ, with two–three major bipoles still in emergence.
In Figure 3, 2nd row from the top, the main emerging
bipoles are indicated with arrows of different colors. Since
the emerging ﬂux was highly sheared, the magnetic inver-
sion line maintained its NE–SW orientation from March 3
throughout the emergence process. High shear in the emerg-
ing ﬁelds was evidenced in the radial magnetic ﬁeld as a
yin-yang magnetic polarity pattern (magnetic tongues; Lu-
oni et al. 2011), indicating strong negative, left-handed he-
licity in the emerging ﬂux. Early on March 6, Chintzoglou
et al. (2015), using SDO/HMI SHARP vector magnetograms,
found the mean shear angle along the PIL to be around 68◦,
which showed a slow increase throughout the day. Chint-
zoglou et al. (2015) pointed out that there were two sources
of shear: highly sheared ﬂux emergence in the NE part of
the AR, and shearing motions between emerging ﬁelds (their
positive polarity) and the pre-existing negative-polarity spot
in the middle of the AR, where the magnetic PIL was nearly
of E–W orientation, and had a quadrupolar structure (cf. Fig-
ure 3, right column).

Takasao et al. (2015) carried out magneto-hydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations showing that
the emergence of a
subsurface-kinked ﬂux rope can spontaneously form a

have sheared bright loops evident on March 5. One day later,
the bright sheared loop system has evolved into a highly
twisted ‘corkscrew’ on its NE end at the beginning of the
rise phase of ﬂare FL1. Figure 1 (bottom panel) shows a
frame from the included movie Movie 1.mp4 at 12:39 UT
on March 6 in which the ‘corkscrew’ feature is prominent in
each of the SDO/AIA passbands (1600 ˚A, 171 ˚A, and 94 ˚A).
Movie 1.mp4 spans from 11:44 UT to 22:29 UT, covering
both conﬁned ﬂares at a cadence of 45 sec but the cadence is
5 min from 14:00 UT to 20:15 UT.

Syntelis et al. (2016) conducted a spectroscopic analysis
of the pre-eruptive conﬁguration of AR 11429 prior to the
eruption of two CMEs that occurred early on 2012 March 7.
Using the same Hinode/EIS data as in our present study, they
found substantial spectroscopic evidence for the presence of
a hot ﬂux rope in the NE section of the AR which formed dur-
ing ﬂare FL1. Two distinct plasma components were identi-
ﬁed by Syntelis et al. (2016), one at 1.6–2.5 MK (log10 T
= 6.2–6.4 K) and the other at 6.3–12.6 MK (log10 T = 6.8–
7.1 K). The hotter component contained regions of enhanced
non-thermal line broadening, relatively strong Doppler up-
ﬂow velocities, and lower plasma densities. Collectively,
these spectral parameters are characteristic of hot ﬂux ropes.

2.3. Flare Ribbons

The lower solar atmosphere evolved in parallel with the
corona during conﬁned ﬂare FL1. Elongated bright rib-
bons appear early in the rise phase of FL1, however, there
is evidence of pre-ﬂare heating at these locations in the
SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A and 171 ˚A passbands (see included movie
Movie 1.mp4). At the peak of the ﬂare, two pairs of ﬂare rib-
bons, R1–R2 and R3–R4, are visible in the SDO/AIA 1600
˚A passband in Figure 2. Ribbon pair R1–R2 is centered on
the N–S aligned, near-vertical section of the polarity inver-
sion line (PIL; cf. SDO’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) magnetogram in Figure 1) in the
NE and the second pair, R3–R4, runs along the E–W aligned,

to the NLFF extrapolation in Figure 11 of Chintzoglou et al. (2015). MFR 1 is rooted in the sunspot umbrae in the north of AR 11429 whereas
the footpoints of MFR2 are located further south in the quiet Sun. Included Movie 2.mp4 is an animation of this ﬁgure. In the movie, the
locations of IFIP-biased and photospheric plasma observed by Hinode/EIS are identiﬁed with arrows.

quadrupolar non-Hale, non-Joy AR with multiple magnetic
inversion lines in its midst. The complex inversion line struc-
ture forms in their simulation by the submergence of emerged
ﬁelds. This simulation gives a good description of AR 11429
and its multiple inversion lines on March 6 (cf. Figure 3,
right column).

Using non-linear-force-free (NLFF) magnetic extrapola-
tions, Chintzoglou et al. (2015) found two ﬂux ropes on
March 6 in AR 11429: magnetic ﬂux rope 1 (MFR1) in
the NE emerging ﬁelds, while ﬂux rope 2 (MFR2) formed
around the pre-existing negative spot, where strong shearing
was observed around the complex E–W inversion line area.
MFR1 had its footpoints in the forming new umbrae, while
the latter (MFR2) ﬂux rope had its footpoints over quiet-sun
areas. The locations of the ﬂux rope footpoints are indicated
in the continuum image at 12:34 UT on March 6 in Figure 3.
Chintzoglou et al. (2015) suggested that MFR1, and probably
MFR2, formed during the M2.2 ﬂare (FL1) that we analyze.
The ﬂare ribbon pair R1–R2 is linked to the formation of
MFR1, while ribbon pair R3–R4 to MFR2 (cf. Figure 2 and
Section 2.3).

For about a day prior to FL1, the highly sheared divergence
of opposite polarities emerging along the PIL led to an inﬂow
of negative magnetic ﬂux moving toward the isolated pre-
existing spot at the eastern footpoint of MFR1 (R1). Flux
approached and collided with the spot, forcing the coales-
cence of the smaller ﬂux fragments into a growing, strongly
coherent umbra surrounded by a common penumbra. At the
western footpoint (R2), the emerging positive ﬂux fragments
crashed into and coalesced with the main positive polarity
in the center of the active region. Repeated ﬂux emergence
episodes drove umbral coalescence until ∼13:00 UT during
FL1. By ∼15:00 UT, the umbra at R1 had ceased coalesc-
ing and by ∼16:00 UT, the umbra at R2 started to break
apart/decay. This process is evident in Movie 2.mp4 begin-
ning at 11:22 UT on March 5 where arrows indicate each
footpoint region in the continuum and radial ﬁeld images.

3. HINODE/EIS OBSERVATIONS OF AR 11429

The observations featured in Figures 4 and 5 were acquired
while Hinode/EIS was operating in an autonomous observ-
ing mode during a Major Flare Watch campaign. When an
intense brightening was detected in the He II 256.32 ˚A lines,
a high cadence ﬂare response study was triggered. A series of
6 rasters at a cadence of nine minutes was run for each ﬂare.
Observations spanned 12:38 UT to 13:32 UT (FL1) and from
21:10 UT to 22:04 UT (FL2) on 2012 March 6. EIS captured
the peak and the decay phase for both ﬂares (see top panel of
Figure 1). Some of the key details of the ﬂare response study
are listed in Table 1.

3.1. Ar XIV/Ca XIV Intensity Ratio

The EIS ﬂare response study contains two lines that are
suitable for measuring plasma composition at temperatures
higher than those expected in non-ﬂaring ARs: low-FIP Ca
XIV (FIP = 6.11 eV) at 193.87 ˚A and high-FIP Ar XIV (FIP
= 15.76) at 194.40 ˚A (Feldman et al. 2009). Both lines are
relatively strong, close in wavelength, and contain no strong
blends. The two ions are formed in ionization equilibrium at
similar temperatures of ∼3.5 MK (log10 T = 6.55 K) (Feld-
man et al. 2009; Doschek et al. 2015), and they have very
similar emissivity temperature dependences: the theoretical
coronal ratio is about 0.25±0.10 over the temperature range
1.6–6.3 MK (6.2 ≤ log10 T ≤ 6.8 K) in coronal conditions
at an electron density of log10 N = 10. However, the ratio
rises to levels exceeding 0.50 at a temperatures above ∼8
MK (log10 T = 6.9 K). (See Figure 7 of the Appendix for a
plot of the ratio of Ar XIV and Ca XIV contribution functions
at different densities calculated using the abundances given
below). With similar contribution functions, the intensity ra-
tio of these lines can be used to determine (I)FIP bias levels.
In line with Doschek et al. (2015); Doschek & Warren
(2016), we use Log10 abundance values, relative to H (with
Log10 (H density) set to 12), as follows: corona–Ca = 6.93
(Feldman 1992) and Ar = 6.50 and photosphere–Ca = 6.33
(Caffau et al. 2011) and Ar = 6.50 (Lodders 2008), yield-
ing a coronal FIP bias of 100.6 = 4. The CHIANTI Atomic
Database, Version 8.0 (Dere et al. 1997; Del Zanna et al.
2015) was employed to carry out the calculations of the con-
tribution functions using these abundances. The abundances
of Ar and Ca affect mostly the magnitude of the respective
contribution functions but not their shapes as a function of
temperature, so the intensity ratio allows us to determine the
relative abundances of Ar to Ca. Typically, the FIP bias is the
ratio of the low-FIP element’s coronal to photospheric abun-
dances and the high-FIP element’s coronal to photospheric
abundances, however, the convention for IFIP bias is to invert
the ratio. We adopt the latter convention such that high-FIP
Ar XIV/low-FIP Ca XIV line intensity ratio > 1 indicates the
IFIP effect, = 1 is unfractionated photospheric plasma, and <
1 is the solar FIP effect. The estimated uncertainty based on
an intensity error of 20% is ±0.28.

All Hinode/EIS data were reduced using the eis prep rou-
tine available in Solar SoftWare (Freeland & Handy 1998).

The routine converts the CCD signal in each pixel into cal-
ibrated intensity units and removes/ﬂags cosmic rays, dark
current, dusty, warm, and hot pixels. The original Hin-
ode/EIS calibration was used instead of the newer calibra-
tions of Del Zanna (2013) and Warren et al. (2014) because
the lines are close in wavelength and within the same spec-
tral window. The ratio of the corrected intensities using either
calibration is within 2% of the original. We ﬁt three Gaus-
sians to the Ar XIV 194.40 ˚A line to remove two unidentiﬁed
weak lines in its blue wing (Brown et al. 2008; Doschek et al.
2015) and to the spectral region around the Ca XIV 193.87 ˚A
line to separate it from two nearby lines. Two sample spectra
for the spectral window are shown in Figure 8 of the Ap-
pendix, one of the FIP effect and the other of the IFIP effect.
Typically, the unidentiﬁed weak lines in the blue wing of the
Ar XIV are evident in the FIP effect spectra but are negligible
in the IFIP effect spectra. Columns 3 and 4 of Figures 4 and
5 show the Ar XIV/Ca XIV intensity ratio maps.

In this work, we have followed the methodology of
Doschek et al. (2015); Doschek & Warren (2016, 2017)
in producing the Ar XIV/Ca XIV intensity ratio maps. They
give a full account of the assumptions and issues concern-
ing this EIS composition diagnostic. We refer the reader to
their extensive discussions contained in this series of papers,
especially Doschek & Warren (2017). This method has the
advantage of being simple, but does not fully account for
the (relatively weak) temperature and density sensitivity of
the ratio. To alleviate any concerns that these effects might
explain the detection of patches of inverse FIP, as an inde-
pendent check, we have analyzed one of the IFIP patches
using the more complete method of computing the FIP bias
from a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis. The
DEM was inferred by measuring the electron density and us-
ing it to compute contribution functions for a set of emission
lines covering a wide range of temperatures (Fe VIII-XXII,
Ca XIV–XV). The ratio of the calculated to observed Ar
XIV intensity gives the FIP bias. This analysis showed that
accounting for the temperature and density sensitivity in-
creased the magnitude of the inverse FIP effect. The reason
is that the Ar XIV line is brighter than expected from theory,
so taking the observed Ar XIV/Ca XIV ratio underestimates

functions are convolved with the DEM, it appears that the
two lines are formed closer to 4.5 MK (log10 T = 6.65 K),
which falls within the temperature range of the ratio values
quoted above. They are also formed over a much narrower
temperature range than expected from theory, so any larger
variations in the ratio outside of the temperature range 3.2–
6.3 MK (6.5 ≤ log10 T ≤ 6.8 K) are not important in this
event (see plots of the ratio in Figure 7 of the Appendix). The
theoretical Ar XIV and Ca XIV contribution functions (G(T))

along with their contribution functions convolved with the
DEM are shown in Figure 9 of the Appendix.

3.2. IFIP Plasma Evolution During Flare FL1

Figure 4 is composed of Hinode/EIS and SDO/AIA im-
ages during ﬂare FL1 as follows: columns 1 and 2 contain
EIS Ar XIV and Ca XIV intensity images; the Ar XIV/Ca
XIV ratio maps are in columns 3 and 4, without and with
SDO/HMI line-of-sight (LOS) contours of ±500 G, and SDO
1600 ˚A and 94 ˚A intensity images are displayed in the last
two columns. The saturation levels are ﬁxed for each column
of intensity images to discern the relative changes in bright-
ness with time for a given wavelength or passband.

The ﬁrst EIS observation at 12:38 UT coincides with the
ﬂare peak. At that time, the AR contains plasma that is pre-
dominantly of coronal composition. FIP bias ranges from
0.25–0.40 (using the ratio of high-FIP element Ar XIV over
low-FIP element Ca XIV but equivalent to 2.5–4 in the solar
FIP bias convention as stated in the previous section). The
highest FIP bias (∼0.25) is located in the N–S directed bright
loops evident in the EIS Ar XIV, Ca XIV, and AIA 94 ˚A in-
tensity images. Nine minutes later at 12:47 UT, the extent
of the strong FIP bias material has spread as the bright loops
expand during the conﬁned eruption. This is also when the
ﬁrst highly localized patches of IFIP plasma composition are
visible in the EIS Ar XIV/Ca XIV ratio images. Both IFIP re-
gions are bordered by a ‘moat’ of photospheric composition
which in turn is surrounded by coronal plasma composition.
Throughout the remainder of the decay phase of FL1, the
western IFIP patch is still clearly visible from 12:56 UT to
13:23 UT, however, the eastern patch evolves from IFIP to
photospheric composition (cf. Ar XIV/Ca XIV intensity ratio
images at 13:14 UT and 13:23 UT in column 3 of Figure 4).
IFIP values are in the range [1.5, 2.1]. The IFIP plasma ap-
pears within the 9-minute time cadence of the EIS rasters and
then rapidly evolves toward photospheric composition within
18 minutes during the decay phase of the M2.2 ﬂare.

Figure 4, column 4, shows that the IFIP patches are lo-
cated at the footpoints of the bright loops connecting the
strong magnetic ﬁeld concentrations of the northern bipole.
We have overlaid green contours of the strong IFIP regions
observed at 12:47 UT on the SDO/HMI continuum image at
the corresponding time in Figure 6 to emphasize the very spe-
ciﬁc position of the anomalous composition within the strong
ﬁeld. The IFIP plasma is located entirely within the umbrae
of the northern bipole. Furthermore, the ﬂare ribbons of FL1
also cross/end at the same places as the IFIP patches over
the umbrae (cf. the intersection of the orange contours of the
ﬂare ribbons and the green contours at the umbrae associated
with ribbon R1 in the NE and R2 along the horizontal PIL).
In summary, IFIP composition is found over umbral areas
crossed by ﬂare ribbons. The footpoints of ﬂux rope MFR1

8

BAKER ET AL.

of Chintzoglou et al. (2015) are rooted in the same umbrae of
the emerging bipole where we observe the IFIP plasma.

3.3. Photospheric Plasma Composition of Flare FL2

Figure 5 contains the same series of images for ﬂare FL2
as is used for FL1 in Figure 4. Once again, the EIS observa-
tions began after the ﬂare trigger was initiated and continued
throughout and beyond the short decay phase of the ﬂare.
The locations of the IFIP plasma within AR 11429 remained
ﬁxed throughout the decay phase of FL1 and appear to cor-
respond to where photospheric-like composition is observed
∼8 hours later during ﬂare FL2 (see the orange patches in the
EIS Ar XIV/Ca XIV intensity ratio maps in Figure 5). Very lit-
tle composition evolution is evident during FL2. The anoma-
lous composition is no longer found to be in distinct IFIP
patches; rather it has near-photospheric composition and is
more dispersed especially in the eastern region. In the west-
ern region, much of the plasma over the positive polarity has
evolved back toward coronal composition. The umbra where
the eastern footpoint of MFR1 is rooted remains a coherent
structure during and after FL2, though it has stopped coalesc-
ing, whereas, the umbra at the other (western) footpoint has
broken up and dispersed (cf. the continuum images at 12:34
and 23:58 of Figure 3 and see the location indicated by the
right arrow in each arrow-pair of Movie 2.mp4).

4. DISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION

4.1. Summary of Plasma Composition Evolution in the

Conﬁned Flares

In this study, we have analyzed the evolution of plasma
composition in the highly active AR 11429 observed by Hin-
ode/EIS during two conﬁned M-class ﬂares. During the ﬁrst
conﬁned ﬂare, FIP bias plasma comprises the AR when the
ﬂare is at peak intensity. Minutes into the ﬂare’s decay phase,
IFIP bias plasma appears at the footpoints of bright ﬂare
loops within the AR. The IFIP patches are surrounded by
a ring of photospheric material. Co-temporally, the spatial
extent of FIP bias increases in the bright ﬂare loops. By
the time the GOES soft X-ray intensity has returned to pre-
ﬂare levels, there is asymmetric composition evolution in the
ﬂare loop footpoints; the plasma at the eastern footpoints
evolves to photospheric composition whereas at the western
footpoints, it maintains IFIP composition encircled by pho-
tospheric plasma composition. Hinode/EIS observes these
extremes in plasma evolution in less than one hour, primar-
ily within the decay phase of the ﬂare. Approximately seven
hours later the second conﬁned ﬂare occurs and photospheric
plasma composition is present in the vicinity of the ﬂare loop
footpoints where IFIP plasma was observed during the ﬁrst
ﬂare.

Distinct IFIP patches occurred near the footpoints of one of
the two magnetic ﬂux ropes identiﬁed by Chintzoglou et al.

(2015) where ﬂare ribbons cross the umbrae of the emerg-
ing bipole in the northern section of the AR. These are very
particular locations within the unusually complex magnetic
conﬁguration of the AR. The fact that the IFIP plasma is only
observed for a short time during the decay phase of a moder-
ate ﬂare in highly localized places within the AR’s magnetic
ﬁeld raises key questions as to what roles, if any, the AR’s
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration and ﬂaring activity have in the
creation and observation of anomalous plasma composition.

4.2. What is the signiﬁcance of the emergence of highly
sheared magnetic ﬁeld and coalescing sunspots?

Such ﬁeld represents different strands of highly sheared
ﬁeld that are converging towards each other to form sunspots,
and therefore meet below the photosphere/chromosphere in
the location of the coalescing umbrae. The high shear in
coalescing strands of the same magnetic polarity suggests
that the strands with a non-zero component of anti-parallel
magnetic ﬁeld have the possibility for sub-chromospheric
magnetic reconnection when brought together. In the high-
β plasma regime of the photosphere/low chromosphere,
upward-moving acoustic waves are generated which can
mode convert to fast mode waves at ∼1 Mm above the pho-
tosphere in the chromosphere where plasma-β is equal to
unity (Bourdin 2017). Over regions of high magnetic ﬁeld
concentration such as sunspots, the transition to a low-β
plasma occurs at lower heights within the photosphere. The
atmospheric models of Avrett et al. (2015), constrained by
observations, show a plasma pressure lower by a factor of
20 to 70 in a sunspot compared to the quiet Sun. This quiet
Sun pressure model is close to the one used by Gary (2001)
to derive the plasma-β versus height. With a ﬁeld strength
of 2500 G, Gary (2001) found plasma-β to be around or
below 0.2 within the photosphere. With the new sunspot
atmospheric model of Avrett et al. (2015), the plasma-β is a
factor between 20 to 70 lower, setting the sunspot umbra well
in the low plasma-β regime. Furthermore, the umbral mag-
netic ﬁeld expands less with height than does the penumbral
ﬁeld. Consequently in the decreasing density, the Alfv´en and
fast mode speeds increase faster in the umbra, leading to the
strongest refraction of fast mode waves, and the strongest
downward ponderomotive acceleration.

This is signiﬁcant in the context of the ponderomotive
force fractionation model (Laming 2012, 2015, 2017). When
Alfv´en wave ﬂux originates in the corona, the ponderomo-
tive force points upward, bringing low-FIP elements up from
the chromosphere so that the FIP effect is observed. Fast
mode waves coming from below the chromosphere means
the ponderomotive force is directed downward thereby de-
pleting low-FIP elements from chromospheric plasma. This
is consistent with Brooks (2018) who found that depletion of

plitudes are of order 1 km s−1 (Bruntt et al. 2010) and rela-
tively constant with stellar spectral type (Kjeldsen & Bedding
2011; Chaplin et al. 2009; Baudin et al. 2011), while around
10 km s−1 is necessary to produce sufﬁcient ponderomotive
acceleration (Laming 2015).

The inference in this paper that subsurface reconnection
generates the waves responsible for the IFIP fractionation is
supported by surveys of FIP and IFIP in stars. Wood et al.
(2018) ﬁnd FIP fractionation reducing and becoming IFIP
fractionation in stellar coronae as the stellar spectral type be-
comes later (i.e., cooler). Interestingly, the IFIP fractiona-
tion appears for stars where the magnetic ﬁeld saturates when
plotted against Rossby number, which is deﬁned as the ratio
of a star’s rotational period to its convective turnover time
(Reiners et al. 2009). Testa et al. (2015) extend this plot to X-
ray emission and FIP/IFIP fractionation against Rossby num-
ber. The saturation of magnetic ﬁeld (or equivalently X-ray
emission) implies the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the rota-
tion is being quenched, presumably by reconnection, which
must presumably be subsurface reconnection because the X-
ray emission also saturates. And, we emphasize, this subsur-
face reconnection coincides with the IFIP fractionation ap-
pearing in the coronae of these stars.

In the case of the pair of ﬂare ribbons R3–R4 linked to
ﬂux rope MFR2 identiﬁed by Chintzoglou et al. (2015), no
anomalous plasma composition was observed at any time
during either ﬂare. MFR2 has footpoints in the quiet Sun
(Chintzoglou et al. 2015) and there were no coalescing um-
brae observed in these locations (cf. the location of the foot-
points of ﬂux rope 2 in the continuum, radial magnetic ﬁeld
images at 12:34 UT on March 6 in Figure 3 and the corre-
sponding locations in Movie 2.mp4). Therefore, the condi-
tions for sub-chromospheric reconnection and the resulting
Alfv´enic wave generation are not satisﬁed at least at the lo-
cations of the ﬂare ribbons. A comparison of the conditions
associated with the two ﬂux ropes highlights that the IFIP
patches are found in very speciﬁc locations within the AR.

4.3. Does ﬂaring play a role in creating IFIP bias plasma?

During a solar ﬂare, magnetic reconnection high up in the
corona accelerates electron beams and initiates Alfv´en waves
downward along magnetic loops connected to the chromo-
sphere (e.g., Fletcher et al. 2011; Laming 2017; Reep et al.
2018).
In the very dense chromosphere, kinetic energy is
converted to thermal energy, causing the plasma to be heated
up to temperatures of log10 T ∼ 7.0 K (10 MK). The over-
dense, heated plasma expands upward, and due to the high
overpressure, ﬁlls the coronal loops driving mass ﬂows from
the chromosphere into the corona i.e., the process of chromo-
spheric evaporation (Neupert 1968).

In most ﬂares, evaporation leads to plasma of photospheric
or near-photospheric composition as both low- and high-FIP

the umbrae associated with ribbon pairs R1–R2. IFIP contours are

low-FIP elements instead of enhanced abundances of high-
FIP elements yields IFIP plasma in post-ﬂare loops.

In the Laming model, Ar/Ca is fractionated between just
above the plasma-β = 1 layer, and below a height of ∼1 Mm
where H starts to be ionized. The plasma-β = 1 layer with
300 G is in the photosphere. The deeper this layer lies, the
more likely acoustic waves generated by sub-photospheric
reconnection will mode convert to magnetoacoustic or fast
mode waves when reﬂected/refracted at high density gradi-
ents while H is still neutral, and causes the IFIP fractionation.
In the case of AR 11429, the umbral magnetic ﬁeld exceeds
500 G, therefore it is plausible that the plasma-β = 1 layer
could be low down in the photosphere or even below that
as discussed above, enabling the IFIP fractionation to take
place.

Chromospheric dynamics generally occur on timescales
much faster than those for ionization and recombination, and
so the chromospheric ionization balance is almost static, al-
though elevated from that expected in equilibrium (Carlsson
& Stein 2002). This is reproduced in the Avrett & Loeser
(2008); Avrett et al. (2015) models. A more important con-
cern resulting from chromospheric dynamics would be the
effect on the wave physics, especially in the low chromo-
sphere where the IFIP fractionation occurs. We speculate that
the extra wave interactions with density structures would in-
crease the reﬂectivity of the chromosphere to Alfv´en and fast
mode waves, thus reinforcing our cconclusions. Extra dy-
namics in the chromosphere are probably required for IFIP,
since it is worth noting that waves generated from solar or
stellar convection are not strong enough, by an order of mag-
nitude in amplitude, or two orders of magnitude in energy,
to cause sufﬁcient IFIP fractionation. Typical turbulent am-

elements are ionized and evaporated together (e.g., Warren
(2014) and other references given in Section 1). The un-
fractionated plasma arises during ﬂares because the upward
ﬂow speed is too fast for sufﬁcient fractionation to occur
(Laming 2009). However, in FL1 we have chromospheric
plasma that is depleted of low-FIP elements located above
coalescing umbrae in the highly sheared emerging ﬁeld. The
atomic masses of Argon and Calcium are similar, 39.948 amu
and 40.078 amu, respectively, so that there is no preferen-
tial evaporation upﬂow of one element over another with the
Ar XIV/Ca XIV intensity ratio composition diagnostic used
in this study. Chromospheric evaporation brings up what is
there, and in the very speciﬁc locations within AR 11429, this
is low-FIP depleted plasma, consequently we observe IFIP
patches in the corona.

The ﬂare ribbons cover a variety of magnetic-ﬁeld
strengths from quiet-Sun to umbral (cf. the location of ﬂare
ribbon contours in Figure 2 and radial magnetograms at
approximately the same time in Movie 2.mp4). At those
locations away from the strong ﬁeld, the Hinode/EIS obser-
vations show that the ﬂare energy releases low-FIP-biased
plasma ﬁrst, creating strong low-FIP composition in ﬂare
loops as observed in FL1 and to a much lesser extent in
FL2. In Figure 4, the loops are ﬁlled with low-FIP enhanced
plasma at 12:38 UT, at the time of the ﬂare peak, and con-
tinue to be ﬁlled with the low-FIP biased plasma from 12:47
UT, when we ﬁrst observe IFIP-biased plasma at the strong
umbral ﬁeld locations, until 13:05 UT.

Over the coalescing umbrae, where the composition deeper
in the chromosphere is depleted of low-FIP elements prior to
the ﬂare, the bottom of ﬂare loops will be ﬁlled with plasma
of IFIP composition. The IFIP patches appear to last as long
as either chromospheric evaporation is triggered by ioniz-
ing electron beams produced by magnetic ﬁeld reconnection
in the corona and/or thermal conduction of coronal plasma
persists (Bagal´a et al. 1995; Cheung et al. 2018). The only
observations of high energy electrons of FL1 are from the
Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The peak in the 25–50
keV energy bin occurs at the peak of the ﬂare at 12:38 UT
before returning to background levels by ∼12:45 UT (not
shown here). As Fermi then entered its night phase, we do
not have observations beyond 12:45 UT, however, the fact
that the electron energy levels have returned to background
levels by this time suggests that chromospheric evaporation
is not driven by electron beams but rather by thermal con-

duction during the later phase of the ﬂare.
once the process of chromospheric evaporation is ﬁnished,
with radiative and conductive cooling taking place, the IFIP
plasma would no longer be observable using the Ar XIV/Ca
XIV diagnostic ratio. Therefore, the patches appear to decay
within the gradual phase of the ﬂare.

The EIS observations indicate that

IFIP-composition
plasma is present in the vicinity of footpoints in certain ﬂare
loops. The ﬂaring reconnected loops inherit the composition
of their progenitor loops, i.e., FIP composition. In addition,
when the top of the chromosphere is being evaporated at the
start of the ﬂare, low-FIP-element enhanced plasma created
during intermittent heating episodes enters the reconnected
loops. Only later, when bremsstrahlung heating reaches
deeper chromospheric layers, will the IFIP-biased plasma be
evaporated. As IFIP plasma is injected into the ﬂare loops,
chromospheric evaporation creates the strongest IFIP bias at
loop footpoints. At greater heights, plasma mixing creates
a transition from IFIP bias through photospheric to FIP bias
composition. A composition gradient from photospheric
to coronal (FIP effect) along ﬂare loops was observed by
Doschek et al. (2018) in an AR at the limb, but in this case
there was no IFIP plasma at the loop footpoints. In a quies-
cent newly emerged AR, Baker et al. (2013) also observed
a composition gradient from the AR’s loop footpoints to
greater heights along the loops.

Our scenario for the role of ﬂaring activity in the creation
and observation of IFIP plasma on the Sun is similar to the
interpretation presented in Laming (2009) for a ﬂare on the
M dwarf star EV Lac which has an IFIP quiescent corona.
Element abundances during a moderate ﬂare showed a near
stellar photospheric composition. Laming (2009) argue that
the downward-directed ponderomotive force in the chromo-
sphere of the IFIP-dominated star increases the heat conduc-
tion from the ﬂare, consequently enhancing chromospheric
evaporation and for active stars like EV Lac, stronger chro-
mospheric evaporation leads to element abundance variation
during ﬂares. However, in the case of the less active Sun,
comparatively reduced evaporation leads to little variation
in the abundances observed during ﬂares, at least on large
scales.

Furthermore, in a multi-wavelength study of a giant ﬂare
observed on active M dwarf CN Leo with an IFIP dominated
corona, Liefke et al. (2010) found more than a twofold in-
crease in the low-FIP Fe abundance during the ﬂare i.e., the
FIP effect, compared to the pre-ﬂare quiescent abundance
level. The peak in Fe abundance enhancement approximately
coincided with the ﬂare’s peak in soft X-ray emission. By the
end of the decay phase, the Fe abundance returned to the pre-
ﬂare level of the quiescent corona, similar to the progression
of plasma composition we observed in the ﬂare loops dur-
ing FL1 in AR 11429. In each case, the plasma appears to
approach photospheric composition and then returns to pre-
ﬂare quiescent coronal composition during the time period of
ﬂare decay phase.

4.4. Why do we observe photospheric composition at the
locations of the IFIP patches during the second ﬂare?

TRANSIENT IFIP

13

The Ar XIV/Ca XIV ratio maps in Figure 5 contain photo-
spheric plasma where IFIP patches had been observed during
FL1. As evidenced in Movie 2.mp4 and described in Section
2.4, by the time of FL2 at ∼21:00 UT, the sunspot coales-
cence was completed and the umbrae had entered their de-
cay phase, halting sub-chromospheric reconnection. There-
fore, the fast mode wave ﬂux arriving from below the chro-
mosphere would have ceased, together with the resulting
ponderomotive force, which had depleted low-FIP elements

‘turned off’. Once the IFIP plasma is no longer generated,
plasma mixing with the surrounding ﬁeld containing low-FIP
bias material would begin to change what we observe in the
corona in these speciﬁc locations; from IFIP to photospheric
composition in ﬂaring loops. Repeated ﬂaring activity af-
ter FL1 may have provided a steady supply of unfractionated
plasma to the vicinity of IFIP patches, accelerating the transi-
tion from IFIP to photospheric composition though this time
period was not observed by Hinode/EIS. The pattern of evo-
lution is partly consistent with what Nordon & Behar (2007,
2008) observed on much larger scales in their study; ﬂares
tend to decrease both IFIP bias in the IFIP-dominated coro-
nae of active stars and FIP bias in the coronae of solar-like
stars (Testa 2010).

In this case study, highly localized inverse-FIP composi-
tion patches are appearing during a conﬁned ﬂare in an over-
all FIP-bias dominated active region. These patches evolve
and fade during the decay phase of the ﬂare. The IFIP patches
are observed in highly sheared emerging ﬂux over coalescing
umbrae crossed by ﬂare ribbons. We propose that subsur-
face magnetic reconnection between coalescing umbrae led
to an increased fast mode wave ﬂux from below the frac-
tionation height and resulted in the depletion of low-FIP el-
ements. When these coalescing umbrae with plasma com-
position depleted of low-FIP elements became footpoints of
ﬂare loops (i.e., they were crossed by ﬂare ribbons), the chro-
mospheric evaporation of the low-FIP depleted plasma led
to the appearance of IFIP patches above these umbrae. The
IFIP patches were observed in the corona as long as chromo-
spheric evaporation lasted. The insight gained from spatially
resolved composition maps suggests that in Sun-as-a-star or
stellar cases the composition of the chromosphere which is
evaporated into ﬂare loops may have local anomalies and a
ﬂare’s effect on the overall coronal composition may depend
on the ﬁlling factor of those anomalous locations. These ﬁnd-
ings are consistent with the Laming model as well as Brooks
(2018). In future work we will analyze the magnetic ﬁeld
evolution of the 8 active regions where IFIP plasma has been
observed to determine how common are the characteristics
seen in this case study when considering the entire sample.

5. CONCLUSION

APPENDIX

We address speciﬁc technical aspects of the Ar XIV/Ca XIV intensity ratio diagnostic described in Section 3.1: the effect of
temperature on the ratio for temperatures exceeding log10 T = 6.8 K; the Gaussian ﬁttings to the Ca XIV spectral window for
sample FIP and IFIP effect spectra; the contribution functions convolved with the differential emission measure (DEM).

Figure 7. Intensity ratios of Ar XIV and Ca XIV contribution functions vs electron temperature for electron densities of log10 N = 9.0, 10.0,
11.0. Shaded box shows the range of the Ar XIV/Ca XIV ratio in the temperature range of [6.2, 6.8] for electron density of log10 N = 10.0 and
coronal abundances as given in Section 3.1. The ratio is quite narrow for a wide temperature range but exceeds 0.50 for temperatures above
log10 T = 6.9 K.

Figure 8. Lines in the Ca XIV spectral window for the Hinode/EIS raster at 12:56 UT on March 6. The Y-axis is intensity. Three Gaussians
were ﬁt to the spectral region around Ca XIV 193.87 ˚A line (red), one for the Fe X 193.72 ˚A (yellow) in the blue wing and the other for the Ni
XVI–Ar XI blend (green) in the red wing. Three Gaussians were ﬁt to the Ar XIV 194.40 ˚A (magenta), two of which lie in the blue wing and
are unidentiﬁed lines (blue and orange; Brown et al. 2008). Top panel: FIP effect spectrum for pixel = [23, 196]. The Ca XIV 193.87 ˚A line
is much more intense compared to the Ar XIV 194.40 ˚A line and FIP bias is ∼0.40. Bottom panel: IFIP effect spectrum at pixel = [024, 216].
The Ar XIV line is more intense than the Ca XIV line and the IFIP bias is ∼1.60. The unidentiﬁed lines in the blue wing of the Ar XIV line are
visible in FIP effect spectra but are less evident in the IFIP spectra.
