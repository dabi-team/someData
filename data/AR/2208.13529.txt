Group invariant solutions for the planar Schr¨odinger-Poisson
system

Ganglong Zhou∗ †

Abstract

This paper is concerned with the following planar Schr¨odinger-Poisson system

−△u + V (x)u + φ(x)|u|p−2u = f (x, u),
△φ = |u|p,

in R2,
in R2,

(

where p ≥ 2 is a constant, V (x) and f (x, t) are continuous, mirror symmetric or rotationally
periodic functions. By assuming that the nonlinearity f (x, t) has critical exponential growth
w.r.t. H 1(R2), we obtain a nontrivial solution or a ground state solution of Nehari type
to the above system. Our results extend previous works of Cao, Dai and Zhang [9], Chen
and Tang [16]. We handle more general nonlinearities f with weaken constraint at inﬁnity,
and we assume only the (AR) type condition to take place of the monotonicity assumption
(Theorem 1.1). We considered all the cases p ≥ 2, and we show the existence of solutions
with multiple types of symmetry. As in [16], we adopt a version of mountain pass structure
which provides a Cerami sequence (Lemma 3.1), with two innovative points. First, we make
a key observation for the sign of a crucial part of the energy functional corresponding to the
nonlocal term φ|u|p−2u (Lemma 2.3), and secondly we adopt a new Moser type functions
(Lemma 3.2) to ensure the boundedness and compactness of the Cerami sequence. Moreover,
our approach works also for the subcritical growth case (Theorem 6.1), and generalizes recent
works [22, 9, 16].

In last decades, considerable attentions have been paid for the following Schr¨odinger-Poisson

system:

−△u + V (x)u + K(x)φ(x)|u|p
△φ = K(x)|u|p,

with various conditions on the parameters p, N and functions V, K, f . In three-dimensional case
N = 3, this kind of system arises in many contexts of physics, for example, in quantum mechanics
[7, 11, 19] and semiconductor theory [5, 6, 21, 23]. In [5], the equation (SP ) was introduced
as a model describing solitary waves, for nonlinear stationary equations of Schr¨odinger type
interacting with an electrostatic ﬁeld, where the unknown functions u and φ denote wave function
for particles and potential respectively. Mathematically speaking, for each u ∈ H 1(RN ), the
second equation in (SP ) determines a unique solution φu in D1,2(RN ), i.e. φu := ΓN ∗ |u|p,
where

ΓN =

and ωN is the volume of the unit ball in RN . When N ≥ 3, many minimization techniques were
used to the system (SP ). We refer the readers to [4, 12, 25, 29] and references therein.

In the following, let us focus on the two dimensional case. In 2008, Stubbe [27] considered

the equation

(S1)

−△u + λu + φ(x)u = 0, △φ = u2,

in R2,

where λ ∈ R is a constant. He set up a variational framework for (S1) with a subspace Z of
H 1(R2):

Z :=

u ∈ H 1(R2) :

(cid:26)

ln(1 + |x|)u2dx < ∞

.

He proved that there exists a unique radial ground state solution for any λ ≥ 0. In addition, he
proved that there exists a negative number λ∗ such that for any λ ∈ (λ∗, 0) there are two radial
ground states with diﬀerent L2 norms.

In 2016, Cigolani and Weth [17] considered the equation (P ) with p = 2 and f (x, u) =

b|u|q

−

2u, that is

(S2)

−△u + V (x)u + φ(x)u = b|u|q
△φ = u2,

in R2,
in R2,

where b ≥ 0, q ≥ 4 are constants and V ∈ C(R2, (0, ∞)) is Z2 periodic. Using the concentration-
compactness theory, they proved that the equation (S2) has a ground state u ∈ X2 and a
solution sequence {un}n ⊂ X2 such that limn

J(un) = ∞. Here

and J is the energy functional associated to (S2).

In 2021, Cao et al. [9] generalized the above consideration for p ≥ 2,

In 2020, Chen and Tang [16] considered the equation (P ) with p = 2, i.e.

△φ = u2,

where V ∈ C(R2, [0, ∞)) is axially symmetry and f ∈ C(R3) is of subcritical or critical exponen-
tial growth in the sense of Trudinger-Moser. More precisely, we say that f (x, t) has subcritical

This notion of criticality was introduced by Adimurthi and Yadava [2].

For the critical growth case, Chen and Tang [16] established the existence of a ground state

solution for (S4) by assuming a series of technical conditions on V and f :

all (x, t) ∈ R2 × R;

(CF2) f (x, t)t > 0 for all (x, t) ∈ R2 × R\{0}, and there exists M0 > 0 and t0 > 0 such that

F (x, t) ≤ M0|f (x, t)|, ∀ x ∈ R2, |t| ≥ t0,

Here we will prove the existence of a nontrivial solution to the equation (P ), not only for
all p ≥ 2, but also for much more general nonlinearities f and more general potentials V (see
Remark 1.2 below).

To describe our main results, we introduce the following notations: Let us view R2 as C, Let

k ∈ N, k ≥ 2, we say that v ∈ Pk if v(ze2πi/k) = v(z) over C. We deﬁne

Ek,p := Xp ∩ Pk, Vk,1 := C(C) ∩ Pk

Fk,1 := {f ∈ C(C × R) : f (·, t) ∈ Pk, ∀ t ∈ R}.

We say that v is mirror symmetric, denoted by v ∈ M if v(z) = v(z) in C. Let

Tk,p := Ek,p ∩ M, Vk,2 := Vk,1 ∩ M,

Fk,2 := {f ∈ Fk,1 : f (·, t) ∈ M, ∀ t ∈ R}.

Our main result is stated as follows.

Theorem 1.1. Let p ≥ 2, V and f satisfy (V0) and (F1). Assume that

(VF) V ∈ Vk,1 and f ∈ Fk,1 with k ≥ 4 or V ∈ Vk,2 and f ∈ Fk,2 with k ≥ 2;

(F2) f (x, t)t ≥ 0 for all (x, t) ∈ R2 × R\{0}, and there exists M0 > 0 and t0 > 0 such that

F (x, t) ≤ M0|f (x, t)| for x ∈ R2, |t| ≥ t0;

(F3) There exists q ∈ R such that lim inf

t
|

qF (x,t)
eα0t2 = +∞;

|

t
|→∞

|

(F4) (AR) type condition: There exist µ1 > 2, µ2 < µ1

2 − 1 such that

f (x, t)t ≥ µ1F (x, t) − µ2V (x)t2, ∀ (x, t) ∈ R3.

(F5) If p = 2, f (t) = o(t) as t → 0 uniformly on R2; and if p > 2, f (t) = O(ts0) with s0 > 1 as

t → 0 uniformly on R2.

Then (P ) has a nontrivial solution ¯u. Moreover, ¯u ∈ Ek,p if V ∈ Vk,1 and f ∈ Fk,1; ¯u ∈ Tk,p if
V ∈ Vk,2 and f ∈ Fk,2.

Remark 1.2. Comparing to Chen and Tang [16, Theorem 4], we have generalized or weaken
all the assumptions (CF1)-(CF4), to (VF) and (F2)-(F4) respectively. More precisely,

• (CF1) means just V ∈ V2,2 and f ∈ F2,2, hence is a special case of (VF);

• The condition (CF4) is a signiﬁcant improvement of (F4) since the (AR) type condition

does not require any monotonicity assumption;

• The condition (F3) is also less restrictive than (CF3) for the behavior of f at inﬁnity;

• (F2) improves slightly (CF2) where f (x, t)t > 0 is replaced by f (x, t)t ≥ 0;

Finally, [16] used implicitly the condition f (t) = o(t) with p = 2 in (F5), seeing the proof of
Lemma 2.6 there.

With a similar condition to (CF4), we can obtain the least energy solution on the corre-

sponding Nehari manifold.

Theorem 1.3. Let p ≥ 2, V and f satisfy (V0), (VF), (F1)-(F3) and (F5). Furthermore, we
assume that

(F4’) For any p ≥ 2, gp(x, t) is non-decreasing on t ∈ (−∞, 0) and t ∈ (0, ∞) respectively, where

gp(x, t) :=

Then (P ) has a nontrivial solution ¯u. Moreover, if V ∈ Vk,1 and f ∈ Fk,1, then ¯u ∈ Ek,p satisﬁes

if V ∈ Vk,2 and f ∈ Fk,2, then ¯u ∈ Tk,p satisiﬁes

Here the symbols Φ, N1, N2 are given by (2.11), (2.12) in the next section.

Comparing to the approach in [16, Theorem 4], we still adopt the consideration of Cerami
sequence, but we make a key observation which is actually Lemma 2.3 on the functional I0.
Furthermore, we construct also a new Moser type function to weaken the condition (CF3) to
(F3). Clearly, our approach works also for subcritical case, which generalizes Theorem 1.2 in
[16], see Theorem 6.1 in section 6.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present some basic results, in partic-
ular we show that the energy functional corresponding to the nonlocal term φ|u|p
2u is non
positive, see Lemmas 2.3. In secction 3, we establish the mountain pass structure, using a new
test function, see Lemma 3.2 below. In sections 4-5, we give the proof of Theorems 1.1 and
1.3 respectively. In section 6, we discuss some open problems about 2-D Schr¨odinger-Poisson
equation, and state our existence result for the subcritical growth case.

Corresponding to (2.5)-(2.7), we deﬁne

i = 0, 1, 2.

For the sake of completeness, we present a proof of Lemma 2.2 in the appendix. The following

lemma is our ﬁrst key observation.
Lemma 2.3. I0(u) ≤ 0, ∀ u ∈ Xp.
Proof. First, let u ∈ C ∞0 (R2) with supp(u) ⊂ B 1
i.e. the unique solution of ∆φ = |u|p, φ ∈ D1,2(R2). Then

Now we conclude by density argument. Indeed, using standard argument, by cut-oﬀ and molli-
ﬁcation, we can check readily that C ∞0 (R2) is dense in Xp, that is for any u ∈ Xp, there exist
{un}n ⊂ C ∞0 (R2) such that limn
kun − ukXp = 0. By the fact I0 = I1 − I2 and Lemma 2.2,
we conclude that I0(u) ≤ 0.
Corollary 2.4. Assume that (V0) and (F1) hold. Then

Proof. For any ω ∈ Xp\{0}, there exists δ > 0 such that m{|ω(x)| ≥ δ} > 0. By Lemma 2.3

Proof. We only consider the case Ek,p since Tk,p ⊂ Ek,p. Let Ω1 := {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : xi ≥ 0},
Ω2 = −Ω1. For any (x, y) ∈ Ω1 × Ω2, one has

p, ∀ u, v ∈ Ek,p or u, v ∈ Tk,p.

A1(|u|p, |v|p) ≥ Ckkukp

Then it follows from the deﬁnition of Ek,p and k ≥ 4 that

3 Variational framework

In this section, we will quote a version of Mountain Pass Theorem and prepare the proof of
Theorem 1.1.

Lemma 3.1. Let Y be a real Banach space and I ∈ C 1(Y, R). Let S be a closed subset of Y
which disconnects Y into distinct connected Y1 and Y2. Suppose further that I(0) = 0 and
(i) 0 ∈ Y1 and there exists α > 0 such that I|S ≥ α,
(ii) There is e ∈ Y2 such that I(e) ≤ 0.
Then I possess a (Ce)c sequence with c ≥ α > 0 given by

c = inf
Γ
γ
∈

max
[0,1]
t
∈

I(γ(t)),

where

and (Ce)c sequence means a Cerami sequence {un} ⊂ X such that

Γ = {γ ∈ C([0, 1], X) : γ(0) = 0, γ(1) = e}

I(un) → c, kI ′(un)kY ∗(1 + kunkY ) → 0.

The proof of the above Lemma can be found in [26, Theorem 3]. We state another key result
which serves as a bridge between the mountain pass structure (see Lemma 3.3) and Theorem
1.1.
Lemma 3.2. Assume that (V0),(F1) and (F3)-(F5) hold. Then there exists n0 ∈ N such that

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.1. We only consider the function space Ek,p, because the
Tk,p case is very similar.

Applying Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4, there exists a sequence {un} ⊂ Ek,p satisfying (3.10) and

kunk ≤ C for some constant C > 0. Moreover, by (3.17), we have

Φ(un) = Φ(¯u) and

Step 3: Φ′(¯u) = 0 in X ′p.

13

Now we will conclude Φ′(¯u) = 0, using the group action on the space Xp. The guideline of
the proof holds for more general cases. Let G ⊂ O(2) be a ﬁnite group of transforms acting on
Xp, where O(2) denotes the group of orthogonal transformations in R2. The action of G on the
space Xp is a continuous map (see [28, Deﬁnition 1.27]):

G × Xp → Xp : [τ, u] → τ (u) = u ◦ τ.

Assume that ϕ ∈ C 1(Xp, R) is invariant by G, that is ϕ(w ◦ τ ) = ϕ(w) for any τ ∈ G, w ∈ Xp.
Let u be a critical point of ϕ in Xp,G, where

Xp,G := {u ∈ Xp : τ u = u, ∀ τ ∈ G}.

We claim that ϕ′(u) = 0 in Xp. In fact, given any v ∈ Xp, we deﬁne

where #(G) denotes the cardinal of G. Clearly, ¯v ∈ Xp,G. Therefore, one has

¯v =

For the second line, we used the fact u ∈ Xp,G. So we have ϕ′(u) = 0 in Xp.

The two cases in Theorem 1.1 are direct consequence of the above discussion. Indeed, let
G1 be the subgroup of O(2) generated by z 7→ ze2πi/k, then Xp,G1 = Ek,p. If G2 is generated by
(cid:3)
z 7→ ze2πi/k and z 7→ ¯z, Xp,G2 = Tk,p. So Φ′(¯u) = 0 in X ′p.

5 Proof of Theorem 1.3

To prove Theorem 1.3, we show several Lemmas. As in the previous section, we will only consider
the Ek,p case.

Lemma 5.1. Assume that (V0),(VF),(F1),(F4’) and (F5) hold, the Nerahi manifold N1 satisﬁes

For any vk, similarly to Lemma 3.3, we can obtain a Cerami sequence {uk,n}n ⊂ Ek,p such that

p (1 + kunkXp) → 0, k ∈ N

Next, we consider the point (2). Let u ∈ Ek,p\{0} be ﬁxed and ζ(t) := Φ(tu) on [0, ∞). By

Now we claim that tu is unique. In fact, for any given u ∈ Ek,p\{0}, let t1, t2 > 0 such that

Therefore, we must have t1 = t2, since g(s) > 0 for any s > 0, s 6= 1.

hence (5.7) holds true. Replacing (4.1) by (5.7) in the the proof of Theorem 1.1 and proceeding
as before, one can conclude the existence of ¯u ∈ Ek,p\{0} with Φ′(¯u) = 0 in X ′p. Obviously,
(cid:3)
¯u ∈ N1, which together with c

In this section, we discuss several open problems above the 2-D Schr¨odinger-Poisson system

in R2,

where V, K ∈ C(R2\{0}, R+), f ∈ C(R2\{0} × R, R) and p > 1. We are interested in the
existence of solutions using the variational method.

In this work, we considered mainly the case K(x) ≡ 1, p ≥ 2 and f (x, t) is of critical growth
in t = ±∞ in Theorems 1.1 and 1.3, and made some progress comparing to [16, Theorem 1.4],
It seems that there are still some rooms for improvement. One idea is to construct better test
functions such that Lemma 3.2 holds. Another idea is to use the concentration-compactness
principle. For that, we could use the idea coming from [22]. In other words, we consider the
equation

As far as we know, there is no existence result for p ∈ (1, 2) even with K(x) ≡ 1. Perhaps
the crucial point is to prove the compactness of Cerami sequence, see the inequality (4.17) for
p ≥ 2.

For K(x) 6= 1, In [3], Albuquerque, Carvalho, Figueiredo and Medeiros proved recently the
existence of ground state of the equation (O) when V, K and f are radial. Therefore, it is natural
to explore the general case with non-radial V, K and f .

As mentioned in the Introduction, our approach works also for the subcritical case, we omit

the proof here since it is very similar to the critical case.

Theorem 6.1. Let p ≥ 2, V and f satisfy (V0),(VF),(F1′),(F5) and the following condition:

(F4’) f (x, t)t > 0 for all (x, t) ∈ R2 × (R\{0}) and there exists µ ∈ (2, ∞), t1 ∈ (0, ∞) such that

f (x, t)t ≥ µF (x, t), ∀ x ∈ R2, |t| ≥ t1;

Furthermore, if p > 2, we assume that

Then (P ) has a nontrivial solution ¯u. Moreover, ¯u ∈ Ek,p if V ∈ Vk,1 and f ∈ Fk,1; ¯u ∈ Tk,p if
V ∈ Vk,2 and f ∈ Fk,2.

Here k · k is deﬁned by (2.3). The fact γ > 0 was proved by [15, Lemma 2.1].

If we
suppose that f (x, t) = 0 for t ≤ 0, and f (x, t) is subcritical at t → ∞, our proof will provide
us a positive solution, roughly speaking, we can replace ¯u with |¯u| in variational approach, the
similar conclusion is valid also for the critical case, namely Theorem 1.1.

Recently, Liu, R˘adulescu, Tang and Zhang [22] considered the equation (O) with V = K ≡ 1
and f (x, u) = f (u). They proved that the equation (O) has a positive solution by assuming
that:

(SF1) f ∈ C 1(R, R+), f (s) ≡ 0 for s ≤ 0 and f (s) > 0 for s > 0;

(SF2) For every θ > 0, there exists Cθ > 0 such that f (s) ≤ Cθ min{1, s}eθs2

, ∀ s > 0.

(SF3) f (s)
s3

is non-decreasing for s > 0.

Clearly, the condition (SF 2) implies that f is subcritical at t = ∞, and (SF 3) yields the
(AR) condition and f (s) = O(s3) at the origin. We can remark that Theorem 6.1 generalized
the above result and also [16, Theorem 1.2], [9, Theorem 1.1].

7 Appendix

In this section, we will give the proof of Lemma 2.2. In fact, we just need to prove Ψ ∈ C 1(Xp, R),
and the readers can refer to [9, Lemma 2.3] for the rest. First, Given any u, v ∈ Xp, for almost
every x ∈ R2

= f (x, u(x))v(x).

On the other hand, we can choose large enough number t1 > 0 such that

Then, f (x, u) ∈ L2(R2), ∀ u ∈ Xp, This will imply that the Gateaux derivative Ψ′g(u) exists and
Ψ′g(u) ∈ X ′p.

Let now {un} ⊂ Xp, kun − ¯ukXp → 0. Hence un → ¯u in H 1(R2). Let us prove Ψ′(¯u) =
