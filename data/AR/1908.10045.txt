We sketch a possible evolutionary scenario by which a highly magnetized super-
Chandrasekhar white dwarf could be formed by accretion on to a commonly observed
magnetized white dwarf. This is an exploratory study, when the physics in cataclysmic
variables (CVs) is very rich and complex. Based on this, we also explore the possibility
that the white dwarf pulsar AR Sco acquired its high spin and magnetic ﬁeld due to
repeated episodes of accretion and spin-down. We show that strong magnetic ﬁeld dra-
matically decreases luminosity of highly magnetized white dwarf (B-WD), letting them
below the current detection limit. The repetition of this cycle can eventually lead to a
B-WD, recently postulated to be the reason for over-luminous type Ia supernovae. A
spinning B-WD could also be an ideal source for continuous gravitational radiation and
soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). SGRs/AXPs
are generally believed to be highly magnetized, but observationally not conﬁrmed yet,
neutron stars. Invoking B-WDs does not require the magnetic ﬁeld to be as high as for
neutron star based model, however reproducing other observed properties intact.

Keywords: white dwarfs; strong magnetic ﬁelds; CVs; pulsars; SGRs/AXPs.

1. Introduction

Several independent observations repeatedly argued in recent past for the existence
of highly magnetized white dwarfs (B-WDs). Examples are overluminous type Ia
supernovae 1,2, white dwarf pulsars 3,4 etc. Also soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs)
and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) could be explained as B-WDs 5–7, while they
are generally believed to be highly magnetized neutron stars 8 without however any
direct detection of underlying required high surface ﬁeld Bs ∼ 1015 G. Interestingly,
explaining SGR/AXP by a magnetized white dwarf requires a lower Bs . 1012 G,
which may however correspond to central ﬁeld & 1014 G. Nevertheless, the origin
of such ﬁelds in a white dwarf remains a question, when the observed conﬁrmed
surface ﬁeld is . 109 G.

Here we explore a possible evolution of a conventionally observed magnetized
white dwarf to a B-WD by accretion, which may pass through a phase exhibiting
currently observed AR Sco. This is an exploratory study, and the present venture
is based more on an idealized situation, when the physics in accreting white dwarfs,
i.e. cataclysmic variables (CVs), is very rich and complex. We also show, based on
some assumption, that the thermal luminosity of such a B-WD could be very small,
below their current detection limit. However, due to high ﬁeld and rotation, their
spin-down luminosity could be quite high. Hence, they could exhibit SGRs/AXPs.

2. Accretion induced evolution

The detailed investigation of the accretion induced evolution faces several diﬃculties
including nova eruptions (hence nonsteady increase of mass) and the eruption and
ejection of accumulated shells. Nevertheless, the discovery of AR Sco, which is a
fast rotating magnetized white dwarf, argues for the possibility of episodic increase
of mass in a CV. Hence, we sketch a tentative evolutionary scenario with repeated
episodes of accretion phase leading to the high magnetic ﬁeld via ﬂux freezing and
spin-power phase decreasing ﬁeld. Eventually this mechanism can plausibly lead
to a B-WD. Note that there are already observational evidences for transitions be-
tween spin-power and accretion-power phases in a binary millisecond pulsar 9. The
conservation laws controlling the accretion-power phase around the stellar surface
of radius R and mass M , which could be inner edge of accretion disk, are given by

lΩ(t)2R(t) =

GM (t)
R(t)2 , I(t)Ω(t) = constant, Bs(t)R(t)2 = constant,

(1)

where l takes care of inequality due to dominance of gravitational force over the
centrifugal force in general, I is the moment of inertia of star and Ω the angular
velocity of the star which includes the additional contribution acquired due to ac-
cretion as well. Solving the conservation laws given by equation (1) simultaneously,
we obtain the time evolution of radius (or mass), magnetic ﬁeld and angular velocity
during accretion. Accretion stops when

where ρ is the density of inner edge of disk.

For a dipolar ﬁxed ﬁeld, ˙Ω ∝ Ω3 7, where over-dot implies time derivative. Gen-
eralizing for the present purpose it becomes ˙Ω = kΩn with k being constant. There-
fore, during the phase of spin-power pulsar (when accretion inhibits), the time evo-
lution of angular velocity and surface magnetic ﬁeld may be given by

where Ω0 is the angular velocity when accretion just stops at the beginning of spin-
power phase at time t = t0, k is ﬁxed to constrain Bs at the beginning of ﬁrst
spin-powered phase, which is determined from the ﬁeld evolution in the preceding
accretion-power phase, α is the angle between magnetic and spin axes. Note that
n = m = 3 corresponds to dipole ﬁeld.

Figure 1 shows a couple of representative possible evolutions of angular velocity
and magnetic ﬁeld with mass (time). It is seen that initial larger Ω with accretion
drops signiﬁcantly during spin-power phase (when accretion stops and hence no
change of mass), followed by its increasing phase. Similar trend is seen in Bs proﬁles
with a sharp increasing trend (with value ∼ 1011 G) at the last cycle leading to the
increase of Bc as well, forming a B-WD. At the end of evolution, it could be left

out as a super-Chandrasekhar B-WD and/or a SGR/AXP candidate with a higher
spin frequency. Of course, in reality they may depend on many other factors and
the current picture does not match exactly with what is expected in AR Sco itself.

˙M = 10−8M⊙Yr−1, α = 10o and R = 104 km at t = 0. This is reproduced from a previous work 7.

3. Luminosity

With the increase of mass, the radius of white dwarfs, hence B-WDs, becomes very
small 4,10.
Indeed, the increase of magnetic ﬁeld is due to decreasing radius via
ﬂux-freezing. Now due to smaller radius, UV-luminosity of B-WDs turns out to be
very small if the surface temperature is same as their nonmagnetic counterpart 7.
However more interestingly, from the conservation of energy, it is expected that
the presence of strong magnetic ﬁeld enforces decreasing thermal energy and hence
lowering luminosity in stable equilibrium.

Combining the magnetostatic and photon diﬀusion equations in the presence of

magnetic ﬁeld but ignoring tension, we obtain

which we solve to obtain the envelop properties. Here P is the matter pressure, PB
the magnetic pressure, κ the opacity, T the temperature, a the radiation constant,
M the mass of white dwarf within the core radius r, which is practically the whole
mass of white dwarf because the envelop is very thin, and L is the luminosity.
For the strong ﬁeld considered here, the radiative opacity variation with B can be
modelled similarly to neutron stars as κ = κB ≈ 5.5 × 1031ρT −1.5B−2 cm2g−1 11.

Further equating the electron pressure for the non-relativistic electrons on both
sides of the core-envelop interface gives

Further T∗ and ρ∗ can be obtained by solving for the ρ − T proﬁle along with
equation (6), as shown in Fig. 2, and knowing T∗, we can obtain r∗ from the r − T
proﬁle. We see that interface moves inwards (r∗ decreases) with increasing B and
L. But ρ∗ increases with increasing L and/or B, as ρ∗ ∝ T 1/2

sents equation (6). This is reproduced from a previous work 13.

With above benchmarking, we now explore, based energy conservation, if the
luminosity of a magnetized white dwarf or B-WD changes. For B = 0 and L =
10−5L⊙, we have r∗ = 0.9978R, ρ∗ = 170.7 g cm−3 and T∗ = 2.332 × 106 K. Using
the same boundary condition as described above, we now solve equations (4) and
(7) with B 6= 0, but vary L in order to ﬁx r∗ = 0.9978R. We ﬁnd interestingly
that L decreases for B 6= 0, as shown in Table 1. Physically this corresponds to
increasing B, and thence magnetic energy, is compensated by decreasing thermal
energy (decreasing T∗) and thence L, when total energy is conserved. Similarly,

increasing B may be compensated by decreasing gravitational energy (decreasing
r∗). In either of the cases, L decreases.

4. SGRs/AXPs as B-WDs

Paczynski 5 and Usov 6 independently proposed that SGRs and AXPs are mod-
erately magnetized white dwarfs but following Chandrasekhar’s mass-radius rela-
tion 14. Many features of SGRs/AXPs are explained by their model at relatively
lower magnetic ﬁelds, while the more popular magnetar model 8 requires ﬁeld & 1015
G, which is not observationally well established yet. Nevertheless, such a white
dwarf based model suﬀers from a deep upper limit on the optical counterparts of
some AXPs/SGRs, e.g. SGR 0418+5729, due to their larger moment of inertia.

Now B-WDs established here could be quite smaller in size and hence have
smaller moment of inertia. Therefore, their optical counterparts, with very low
UV-luminosities, are quite in accordance with observation. Hence, the idea of B-
WD brings a new scope of explain SGRs/AXPs at smaller magnetic ﬁelds, which
are observationally inferable, compared to highly magnetized magnetar model. For
details see the work by Mukhopadhyay & Rao 7.

5. Continuous Gravitational Radiation

Due to smaller size compared to their regular counterpart, B-WDs rotate relatively
faster. Now if the rotation and magnetic axes are misaligned, they serve as good
candidates for continuous gravitational radiation due to their quadrupole moment,
characterized by the amplitude 15

(1 + cos2 α0) cos Φ(t), h×(t) = h0 cos α0 sin Φ(t), h0 =

, (8)

where α0 is the inclination of the star’s rotation axis with respect to the observer,
Φ(t) is the signal phase function, ǫ amounts the ellipticity of the star, Izz is the
moment of inertial about z-axis, and D is the distance between the star and detector.

6

A B-WD of mass ∼ 2M⊙, polar radius ∼ 700 km, spin period Ps ∼ 1 s 16,
ǫ ∼ 5 × 10−4 and D ∼ 100 pc would produce h0 ∼ 10−22, which is within the
sensitivity of the Einstein@Home search for early Laser Interferometer Gravitational
Wave Observatory (LIGO) S5 data 15. However, DECIGO/BBO would give a ﬁrm
conﬁrmation of their gravitational wave because they are more sensitive in their
frequency range. In fact, if the polar radius is ∼ 2000 km with Ps ∼ 10 s and other
parameters intact, DECIGO/BBO can detect it with h0 ∼ 10−23. Nevertheless,
(highly) magnetized rotating white dwarfs approaching B-WDs are expected to be
common and such white dwarfs of radius ∼ 7000 km, Ps ∼ 20 sec and D ∼ 10 pc
could produce h0 & 10−22 which is detectable by LISA.

6. Summary

The idea of B-WD has been proposed early this decade, mainly to explain observed
peculiar type Ia supernovae inferring super-Chandrasekhar progenitor mass. Lately
it has been found with various other applications, e.g. SGRs/AXPs, white dwarf
pulsars like AR Sco, continuous gravitational wave etc. Here we have attempted
to sketch a plausible evolution scenario to explain the formation of such a highly
magnetized, smaller size white dwarf.
In our simplistic picture, ignoring many
complicated CV features, we are able to show that a commonly observed magnetized
white dwarf could be evolved to a B-WD via accretion. Hence, the existence of
highly magnetized, rotating, smaller white dwarfs is quite plausible.
