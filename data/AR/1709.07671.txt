Abstract

We show that quantum conﬁnement in the valence and conduction bands of

semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes can be engineered by means of

artiﬁcial defects. This ability holds potential for designing future nanotube-

based quantum devices such as electrically driven, telecom-wavelength, room-

temperature single-photon sources. Intrananotube quantum dots with sub-10

nm lateral sizes are generated between consecutive Ar+ or N+ ion-induced de-

fects, giving rise to quantized electronic bound states with level spacings of the

order of 100 meV and larger. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling spec-

troscopy, we resolve the energy and real space features of the quantized states

and compare them with theoretical models. Eﬀects on the states structure

due to asymmetric defect scattering strength and the inﬂuence of the Au(111)

substrate are remarkably well reproduced by solving the Schr¨odinger equation

over a one-dimensional piecewise constant potential model. Using ab-initio cal-

culations, we demonstrate that vacancies, chemisorbed nitrogen ad-atoms and

1. Introduction

Despite the rise of graphene and other 2D materials, semiconducting single-

walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are still regarded as strong candidates for

the next generation of high-performance ultrascaled transistors [1, 2, 3] as well

as for opto-electronic devices [4, 5] such as chip-scale electronic-photonic plat-

forms [6] or low-threshold near-infrared tunable micro-lasers [7]. Engineering

a quantum dot (QD) along a (suspended) semiconducting SWNT foreshadows

promising opportunities in the ﬁeld of quantum information processing and

sensing through recently proposed schemes such as detection and manipula-

tion of single spins via coupling to vibrational motion [8], optomechanical cool-

ing [9] as well as all optical manipulation of electron spins [10]. Furthermore,

the quasi one-dimensional geometry of SWNTs allows for deﬁning tunable p-n

junctions induced by electrostatic doping through local gates [11, 12]. Combin-

ing a well-deﬁned QD within such a p-n junction structure could constitute a

crucial building-block for the realization of highly desirable electrically driven,

on-demand single photon emitters operating at telecom wavelength, based e.g.

on a turnstile device architecture [13, 14]. In practice, QDs in carbon nanotubes

have been reported predominantly for two diﬀerent conﬁnement structures: i)

Engineered tunneling barriers at metal-nanotube contacts [15] and/or by gate

electrodes, used e.g. to manipulate single electron spins [16], ii) Unintentional

localization potentials stemming from environmental disorder [17], allowing for

single-photon emission mediated by localization of band-edge excitons to QD

2

states [5, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Both types of structures are usually operated at cryo-

genic temperature due to small energy scales ranging from a few to few tens of

millielectronvolts.

Another technique for achieving conﬁnement in SWNTs makes use of arti-

ﬁcial defects such as covalently bound oxygen or aryl functionalization groups

on the side walls of semiconducting SWNTs, inducing deep exciton trap states

allowing for single-photon emission at room temperature [22, 23]. Also, carrier

conﬁnement between defect pairs acting as strong scattering centers has been

reported for mechanically induced defects [24] as well as for ion-induced defects

with reported level spacings up to 200 meV in metallic SWNTs [25]. The latter

technique, combined with recent progress in controlling defects structure and

localization [26, 27, 28] oﬀers a high potential for engineering a broad set of

SWNT-based quantum devices operating at room temperature.

Here, we demonstrate conﬁnement of electrons and holes in sub-10 nm QD

structures deﬁned by ion-induced defect pairs along the axis of semiconduct-

ing SWNTs. Using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spec-

troscopy (STM/STS), bound states with level spacings of the order of 100 meV

and larger are resolved in energy and space. By solving the one-dimensional

Schr¨odinger equation over a piecewise constant potential model, the eﬀects of

asymmetric defect scattering strength as well as the inﬂuence of the Au(111)

substrate such as terrace edges on the bound states structure are remarkably

well reproduced. By means of ab-initio calculations based on density functional

theory and Green’s functions, we ﬁnd that single (SV) and double vacancies

(DV) as well as chemisorbed nitrogen ad-atoms are good candidates to pro-

duce QDs with the experimentally observed features. These simulations also

allow to study the scattering proﬁle as a function of energy for diﬀerent defect

combinations.

2. Experimental section

The experiments have been performed in a commercial (Omicron) low tem-

perature STM setup operating at ∼ 5 K in ultra high vacuum. Topography

images have been recorded in constant current mode with a grounded sample,

using mechanically cut Pt/Ir tips. Diﬀerential conductance dI/dV spectra, pro-

portional in ﬁrst approximation to the local density of states (LDOS) [29] have

been recorded using a lock-in ampliﬁer technique. The LDOS spatial evolution

along a nanotube axis is obtained by dI/dV (x, V ) maps built by a series of

equidistant dI/dV spectra. Spatial extent mismatches between topography im-

ages and consecutive dI/dV (x, V ) maps have been systematically corrected [30],

and the metallic nature of the tip has been systematically checked on the gold

substrate to prevent any tip artefacts before recording STM or/and STS data

sets.

Nanotube samples were made of extremely pure high-pressure CO conver-

sion (HiPCo) SWNTs [31] with a diameter distribution centered around 1 nm,

FWHM ∼ 0.3 nm [32]. The measured intrinsic defect density was below one

defect every 200 nm. SWNTs were deposited on atomically ﬂat Au(111) sur-

faces from a 1,2-dichloroethane suspension, followed by an in-situ annealing

process [33, 30].

Local defects in SWNTs have been created in-situ by exposure to:

(i)

Medium energy ∼ 200 eV argon ions (Ar+) produced by an ion gun [30, 25], (ii)

Low energy (few eV’s) nitrogen ions (N+) produced by a 2.45 GHz ECR plasma

source [33, 34]. In both cases, the exposure parameters have been calibrated to

reach an average defect separation along the SWNTs of about 10 nm [30, 33].

In Fig. 1 (a) and (b), we show 3D STM images of the same semiconducting

SWNT (referred as SWNT I in the following) with Ar+ ions-induced defect sites

labeled d1 − d5 . Panel (d) shows a 3D STM image of a second semiconducting

In both cases, defect sites typically appear as hillock-like protrusions with an

apparent height ranging from 0.5 ˚A to 4 ˚A and an apparent lateral extension

varying between 5 ˚A and 30 ˚A [34, 30, 36].

The resulting dI/dV (x, V ) maps recorded along the horizontal dashed line

drawn in the STM images (b) and (d) are displayed in panels (c) and (e) in

Fig. 1, respectively. Defect signatures in the LDOS in both cases are character-

ized by deep in-gap states at the defects positions. This is consistent with the

expected defect structures, i.e. mainly SVs, DVs and combinations thereof for

collisions with Ar+ ions [30] and bridgelike N ad-atom for collisions with N+

ions [36, 37]. Note that gap states at energy levels ∼ 0.2 eV and ∼ 0.05 eV in

panels (c) and (e), respectively, are shifted to the right from d3 by about 1 nm

and to the right from d6 by about 2 nm. This indicates the presence of intrinsic

or ion-induced defects on the lateral or bottom side wall of the SWNTs [38],

not visible in the topographic images. These defects are labelled d3(cid:48) and d6(cid:48),

respectively.

Remarkably, the dI/dV (x, V ) maps in Fig. 1 exhibit several broad discrete

states in the conduction bands of SWNT I, II (white dashed boxes in panel (c)

and (e), respectively) and in the valence band of SWNT I (white dashed box in

panel (c)), characterized by a modulation of the dI/dV signals in the spatial di-

rection between pairs of consecutive defect sites d3(cid:48) − d4 and d6(cid:48) − d7. Enlarged

plots of these boxed regions are displayed in Fig. 2(a)-(b) and Fig. 3(a) for

SWNTs I and II, respectively. In the conduction bands, cross-sectional curves

recorded along the black horizontal dashed lines labelled m1–m3 in Fig. 2(a)

and m1–m4 in Fig. 3(a) are plotted below the LDOS panels. These clearly

reveal one to three and respectively one to four spatially equidistant maxima.

The number of maxima increases for increasing |Vbias| and the measured level

spacings between consecutive discrete states is of the order of 100 meV and

larger for both cases. This indicates that defect sites d3(cid:48) − d4 and d6(cid:48) − d7,

respectively separated by 12.1 nm and 11.2 nm, act as strong scattering centers

able to conﬁne carriers in semiconducting SWNTs [25, 39]. Such intrananotube

in the following. We estimated the level spacings in the conduction band of QD

I to 98 meV (m1-m2) and 116 meV (m2-m3). For QD II, we measured 122 meV

(m1-m2), 185 meV (m2-m3) and 210 meV (m3-m4).

In the valence band of SWNT I, discrete states with level spacings of the

order of 80-90 meV, with one clear maximum at the level m-1, can also be

distinguished between defect sites d3(cid:48) − d4 in Fig. 2(b). The discretization of

the states indicates that this QD structure also conﬁnes holes. Discrete states

starting from m-2 and lower show less well deﬁned structures compared to the

conduction band states. In the case of SWNT II, no clear discrete states are

observed in the valence band (see supplementary information). These observa-

tions are most probably the result of an energy dependent scattering strength

of the defects, respectively d3(cid:48)-d4 and d6(cid:48)-d7, leading here to a weaker conﬁne-

ment in the valence band. Such energy dependence is well known for metallic

SWNTs [40, 41, 42, 43] and is corroborated by our ab-initio calculations. Note

that mixing eﬀects with defect states and substrate-induced eﬀects [44] cannot

be ruled out.

Another remarkable feature in the LDOS is the strong spatial asymmetry of

the lowest energy states m1 and m-1 in QD I and m1 in QD II. In QD I, m1 is

shifted to the right side of the dot while m-1 is shifted to the left side. Higher

states m2 and m3 show more symmetry in terms of position of the maxima rela-

tive to the center of the QD. In QD II, m1 is shifted to the right side of the QD.

We attribute the observed lowest energy states asymmetry (for electrons as well

as for holes) in part to their strong sensitivity to weak potential modulations

within the QD structure (as we will show in section 3.2). For QD I, this as-

sertion is supported by the observation of a 0.25 nm high Au(111) terrace edge

located around the center of the QD, leading to a supported-suspended interface

(see white dashed lines in Fig. 1(b) and more topographic details in Fig. S2(a)-

(d) in supplementary information). Such conﬁgurations have been reported to

induce a rigid shift in the SWNT bands [45], for instance here a down-shift in

the right side of QD I corresponding to the ”suspended” portion between two

9

terraces. In QD II, we attribute the spatial shift of m1 to a potential modula-

tion induced by a layer of disordered impurities, most probably residua from the

1,2-dichloroethane suspension, lying between the gold substrate and the SWNT

(see Fig. 1(d) and Fig. S2(e)-(h) in supplementary information).

Also, the LDOS in QD I and II (Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 3(a), respectively) reveals

asymmetric patterns with curved stripes oriented from top left to bottom right

for QD I and from bottom left to top right for QD II. These are characteristic

signatures for defect pairs with diﬀerent scattering strengths [39, 25]. For in-

stance here, the left defect in QD I (d3(cid:48)) has a larger scattering strength than

the right one (d4), while the right defect in QD II (d7) has a larger scattering

strength than the left one (d6(cid:48)).

The exact atomic structure of the defects could in principle be determined

from a comparison of dI/dV spectra with simulated ﬁrst-principle LDOS sig-

natures of expected defect types.

In reality, this is hampered by the large

number of possible geometries to simulate, including complex multiple defect

structures [30], together with the large unit cells of the semiconducting chiral

SWNTs studied here.

3.2. 1D piecewise constant potential model

To better understand the physical origins of the non-trivial signatures of the

quantized states, we model the experimental dI/dV maps by solving the time

independent one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation over a piecewise constant

potential model of QD I and QD II. The scattering centers are approximated

by semi-transparent rectangular tunneling barriers leading to a square conﬁne-

ment potential [16]. This is supported by previous results on defect-induced

conﬁnement in metallic SWNTs using the same experimental conditions [25]

and is consistent with ab-initio simulations presented later in this work. The

potential modulation within the QD is approximated by a potential step. The

resulting potential geometries are illustrated with gray shaded areas in Fig. 2

(c) and (d) and Fig. 3(b). Dispersion relations E(k) can be extracted experi-

10

mentally from the quantized states wavefunctions by measuring the energy and

corresponding momenta in the left and right sides of the QDs. The wavevec-

tors k are determined using stationary wave-like ﬁtting functions [25] displayed

with dashed red curves in Figs. 2(a)-(b) and 3(a)). From this procedure, the

potential step height and position can be estimated (see supplementary infor-

mation). The experimental data sets E(k) are plotted in the right panels of

Figs. 2(a) and 3(a) together with dispersion relations from a third-nearest neigh-

bor tight-binding calculation closely approximating ab-initio results [46]. These

chirality-dependent tight-binding dispersion relations, calculated within an ex-

tended Brillouin zone resulting from the defect-induced breaking of the transla-

tion invariance [39], are used in the Hamiltonian of our one-dimensional model.

Taking into account the measured chiral angle, diameter distribution [32] and

measured bandgaps, we ﬁnd the best match with chiralities (7, 6) for QD I and

(11, 1) for QD II (see supplementary information).

Once chiralities together with potential step heights and positions are opti-

mized, one can ﬁt the height and width of the rectangular tunneling barriers in

order to reproduce the experimental level spacings and general LDOS patterns.

On a qualitative ground, a symmetric double barrier system results in the for-

mation of spatially symmetric discrete bound states. Increasing both barrier

heights simultaneously shifts the bound state energy levels and level spacings

up. This leads to sharper bound states as the conﬁnement in the QD is made

stronger thus increasing the lifetime of the conﬁned electrons. Increasing the

barrier thickness with constant inner edge separation does not aﬀect much the

level spacings but further sharpens the bound states. Any asymmetry intro-

duced by a change in the width or height of one single barrier leads to broader

bound states. The presence of a potential step modiﬁes the LDOS in lifting the

levels of the bound states, with a more pronounced eﬀect on the lower states.

In QD I and II, the center of each barrier is aligned with the center of the gap

states (d3(cid:48)-d4 for QD I and d6(cid:48)-d7 in QD II) and the width ratio is kept propor-

tional to the ratio of the spatial extent of the gap states. Thus, by increasing

the width of the barriers, we decrease the length of the QD leading to higher

11

level spacings, and vice versa. The experimental level spacings can then be

approximated by tuning both barrier widths in the same ratio and the heights

individually, knowing that the scattering strength of d3(cid:48) (d7) is larger than d4

(d6(cid:48)) according to the observed asymmetry in the LDOS described above 1.

For QD I, we ﬁnd a good match in the conduction band for the barrier heights

Vd3(cid:48) = 1 eV and Vd4 = 0.85 eV, widths ad3(cid:48) = ad4 = 3.4 nm, and potential step

VL − VR = 60 meV. With these parameters, the spatial proﬁle of the obtained

quantized states (see lower subpanels in Fig. 2(a) and (c)) reproduces the ex-

perimental modulation features remarkably well. Also, the simulated LDOS

displays a pattern with curved stripes oriented from top left to bottom right, as

observed experimentally, due to a left barrier with a larger scattering strength.

In the valence band, although modes m-2 and lower do not show a well deﬁned

structure in the spatial direction, thinner barriers with dimensions ad3(cid:48)/d4 = 2.5

nm, Vd3(cid:48)/d4 = −0.4 eV, leading to a slightly longer QD length (9.6 nm compared

to 8.7 nm in the conduction band) can reproduce the measured level spacings

very well.

For QD II, we observed that the measured energy levels are overestimated

by a factor α ∼ 1.29, presumably due to a voltage division eﬀect induced by

the impurity layer mentioned above (see details in supplementary information).

We ﬁnd a good agreement with the experimental LDOS with the parameters:

Vd3(cid:48) = Vd4 (cid:39) 0.47 eV, ad6(cid:48) = 1.5 nm, ad7 = 2.6 nm and UC = VL − VR (cid:39) 47

meV. Note that in Fig. 3(b) the barrier and potential heights are multiplied

by α to allow a direct comparison with the experimental LDOS. The simulated

LDOS shows a pattern with curved stripes oriented from bottom left to top

right, as observed experimentally, due to a right barrier exhibiting a larger scat-

tering strength. Also, the spatial proﬁle of the obtained bound states (see lower

subpanels in Fig. 3(a) and (b)) reproduces the experimental features quite well.

Note also that one can distinguish an isolated state in the experimental LDOS at

an energy level between m1 and m2, about in the middle of the QD. This state

that prevented an accurate ﬁt of the state m2 in the right QD part is attributed

to a spatial feature visible in the STM topography image in Fig. 2(d) (see also

supplementary information, Fig.S2(f)), probably a physisorbed impurity which

does not aﬀect the LDOS signiﬁcantly.

3.3. Ab-initio calculations

In order to elucidate the physical nature of the electron/hole conﬁning scat-

tering centers, we performed ab-initio simulations based on a combination of

density functional theory [47, 48, 49, 50], maximally localized Wannier or-

bitals [51] and Green’s functions (see supplementary information). Without loss

of generality, we have simulated short unit cell semiconducting zigzag SWNTs

with diﬀerent combinations of the most probable defect structures. Results for

vacancy defects likely being induced by 200 eV Ar+ ions, separated by about 11

nm in a (16, 0) SWNT are shown in Fig. 4(a)-(c) with DV-DV, DV-SV and SV-

SV pairs, respectively. The LDOS displays midgap states at the defect positions

as expected as well as defect states in the valence band [30]. Most importantly,

clear quantized states with a number of maxima increasing with energy are ob-

served between the defects in the conduction band, emphasizing the ability of

SVs and DVs to conﬁne carriers. For the asymmetric conﬁguration DV-SV, one

can distinguish faint curved stripe patterns oriented from top left to bottom

right, indicating a larger scattering strength for DVs compared to SVs. This is

consistent with observations in transport experiments [52]. On the other hand,

the patterns in the valence band strongly depend on the defect types. Discrete

states can be distinguished for the DV-DV case, with m-2 being mixed with

For the DV-SV case, clear curved stripe patterns oriented from

bottom left to top right indicate again a stronger scattering strength for DV.

Also, broader states are observed, indicating that the scattering strength of DVs

and SVs is weaker in the valence band compared to the conduction band.

More insight on the energy dependent scattering strength for each defect

pair conﬁguration can be obtained by extracting the wavevector kn(En) for

each resonant state. This data set is plotted in Fig. 4(d) for the conduction

and valence bands together with the (16, 0) dispersion relations calculated from

the third-nearest neighbor TB model and from the ab-initio calculation for the

pristine nanotube. A ﬁrst observation is the excellent agreement between TB

and ab-initio results, further validating the method used in Figs. 2(a)-(b) and

3(a). The vertical dashed lines indicate the limiting kn,∞ = π·n

L values cor-
responding to the closed system (inﬁnite hard walls potential) with L = 11.1

nm being the defect-defect distance.

In the conduction band, we ﬁnd that

kn(En) = π·n

Leff (n) < kn,∞, indicating that the eﬀective lengths Leﬀ (n) of the
QD are larger than L (i.e. the resonant states wavefunctions are characterized

by penetrating evanescent modes inside the defect scattering potential), as ex-

pected for an open system. The shortest Leﬀ (n) are obtained for the DV-DV

conﬁguration with 12.1 nm (m1), 13.1 nm (m2) and 12.9 nm (m3), which we

attribute to wider scattering potential proﬁles for DVs compared to SVs. In

the valence band, we ﬁnd that kn(En) = π·n

Leff (n) > kn,∞, with Leﬀ (n) values
between 7.9 nm (DV-DV, m-1) and 9.66 nm (DV-SV, m-2). We attribute this

pronounced QD shortening to wider scattering potential proﬁles of both DVs

and SVs in the valence band, probably due to mixing with wide spread defect

states in the valence band.

Ab-initio calculations for diﬀerent defect pairs combinations containing at

least one N ad-atom, i.e. N-DV, N-SV and N-N, are presented in Fig. 4(e)-(h)

for a (17, 0) SWNT, along with details on the defects geometries. Remarkably,

clear QD states are generated for all three conﬁgurations, underlining the po-

tential of N ad-atoms to conﬁne carriers in semiconducting SWNTs and thus to

generate intrananotube QDs.

15

In order to demonstrate the scattering strengths of the diﬀerent defects,

we calculated the energy dependent conductance in addition to the LDOS for

the diﬀerent combinations of the QD deﬁning scattering defects on the (16, 0)

and (17, 0) SWNTs, see supplementary information. Generally we can observe

strong conductance modulation of the order of 30-40% with regard to the pris-

tine CNT for all three tested defects (double vacancies DV, single vacancies SV

and chemisorbed C-N) with the DVs having the largest scattering strength in

the CB and VB.

Note that the choice of the zigzag SWNT chiralities in the two diﬀerent

ab-initio scenarios is motivated by the diﬀerent eﬀective masses of both chiral-

ities (m∗

(17,0) > m∗

(16,0)) which is typical for chirality families (3n − 1, 0) and
(3n − 2, 0) [53]. Taking advantage of recent reports on SWNT chirality con-

trol [54, 55, 56], this property could be used in practice to design QDs with

diﬀerent level spacings for the same QD length. From an application point of

view, however, QDs generated by DVs will have far superior stability at room

temperature due to their high migration barrier above 5 eV (∼ 1 eV for single

vacancy) [57]. This value drops down by at least 2 eV for N ad-atoms depending

on their chemisorption conﬁguration [37, 58].

Our ab-initio simulations do not take into account any substrate eﬀect. In

the experimental case, the carriers can decay through the substrate, thus lim-

iting their lifetime. This leads to state broadening, measured between about

60 meV up to 120 meV in QD I and II, while the quantized states widths in

ab-initio simulations vary between about 5 meV and 45 meV. This suggests

that a better contrast of the experimental quantized states, especially in the va-

lence band, could be achieved by lowering the nanotubes-substrate interaction

through e.g. the insertion of atomically thin insulating NaCl ﬁlms [59]. This

would allow to gain more insight on the electronic structure of the QDs as well

as in the associated scattering physics at the conﬁning defects [25].

16

4. Conclusions and outlook

In summary, using low-temperature STM/STS measurements supported by

an analytical model and ab-initio simulations, we have demonstrated that in-

trananotube quantum dots with conﬁned electron and hole states characterized

by energy level spacings well above thermal broadening at room temperature can

be generated in semiconducting SWNTs by structural defects such as vacancies

and di-vacancies, as well as nitrogen ad-atoms. These results, combined with re-

cent progresses in type and spatial control in the formation of defects [26, 27, 28]

as well as chirality control [23], hold a high potential for applications in the de-

sign of SWNT based quantum devices. These include e.g. electrically driven

single-photon emitters operating at room temperature and telecom wavelength.

In this context, the observation of quantum conﬁnement eﬀects in the emitted

light of cut, sub-10 nm, semiconducting SWNTs [60] shall be seen as an addi-

tional motivation for investigating the optical properties of our ”QD with leads”

building-blocks. These would include e.g. studying optical transitions selection

rules for diﬀerent types and conﬁgurations of defect pairs [61] associated with

experimental studies such as photoluminescence [62] combined to g(2) correla-

tion measurements [20] in suspended SWNT devices as well as photocurrent

imaging [63] and spectroscopy [64].
