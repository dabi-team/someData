We report on the electrical properties of polycrystalline NbO2 thin film vertical 

devices grown on TiN coated SiO2/Si substrates using pulsed laser deposition. First, we 

analyzed the thickness and contact size dependences of threshold switching of NbO2 

films  grown  in  10  mTorr  Ar/O2  mixed  growth  pressure,  where  25.1%/74.9%  of 

NbO2/Nb2O5 surface composition content was estimated by ex-situ x-ray photoelectron 

spectroscopy. The leakage current properties in the insulating state were dominated by 

trap-charge assisted Poole-Frankel conduction mechanism. The threshold switching and 

self-sustained  current  oscillatory  behavior  of  films  with  different  NbO2/Nb2O5 

composition ratios was measured and analyzed. The second film was grown in lower (1 

mTorr)  growth  pressure  which  resulted  in  a  higher  (34.2%/65.8%)  NbO2/Nb2O5  film 

surface composition. The film grown in higher growth pressure demonstrated lower off-

state  leakage  current,  faster  switching  and  self-sustained  oscillations  with  higher 

frequency than the film grown in lower growth pressure.

Introduction 

Transition metal oxides demonstrating metal-to-insulator transitions (MIT), such 

as  VO2

1-3  and  NbO2,  are  widely  studied  materials  for  the  use  as  selector  elements  in 

resistive random access memory (RRAM) and in current oscillatory devices.1-14 VO2 has 

shown  changes  on  the  order  of  105  in  resistivity  around  TMIT  =  340  K.1  The  MIT 

temperature of VO2, however, is close to room temperature and can be easily reached by 

heat dissipation while used in electronic devices.  NbO2, on the other hand has a much 

higher MIT temperature (TMIT = 1081 K)15,16 making this material a robust candidate for 

current threshold switching devices.4-14 

Previously  reported  NbO2  thin  film  vertical  devices  have  been  composed  of 

amorphous  NbO2  films.4-7,10-14  In  the  case  of  amorphous  films,  it  is  proposed  that  a 

crystalline  conducting  path  is  formed  during  the  initial  electroforming  process  where 

crystallization is mainly governed by the nucleation of the amorphous thin film material 

followed by  crystal  growth.17,18  A  continuous  increase  in  crystalline  area  and  in  crystal 

grain  size  upon  multiple  resistance  switching  cycles  leads  to  reduced  device  lifetimes. 

Also,  relatively  high  OFF-state  leakage  currents  >10  A9,11-14  result  in  larger  power 

dissipation  >10  μW/bit, assuming  an  operation  voltage  of  1  V,  and  thus  a  reduction  in 

leakage  current  would  be  beneficial.  Epitaxial  films,  on  the  other  hand,  have  longer 

current switching times and thus are not deemed suitable for applications in devices.19,20  

Here we report on the structural and electrical properties of NbO2 polycrystalline 

thin films grown using PLD on TiN coated SiO2/Si substrates, a platform important for the 

2 

 
 
 
further development of electronic devices based on NbO2. We pursued three promising 

routes for optimizing the performance of NbO2-x film devices: (1) varying thickness of the 

film,  (2)  varying  the  size  of  top  electrode  metallic  contacts,  and  (3)  varying  Nb4+/Nb5+ 

content ratio.  

II. 

Experimental details 

TiN (11 nm)/SiO2(100nm)/Si wafers, provided by Micron Technology, were used 

as substrates for NbO2 thin film growth using pulsed laser deposition. A ceramic target of 

Nb2O5  was  prepared  from  Nb2O5  powder  (99.99%,  Sigma-Aldrich).  The  powder  was 

pressed into a pellet and sintered for 72 h in air at 1300 °C.  The distance between the 

target  and  the  substrate  was  7.3  cm.  The  KrF  laser  energy  density  at  the  target  was 

approximately 2 J/cm2 and its pulse repetition rate was 5 Hz. The substrate temperature 

was kept at 700 °C. A set of films with different thicknesses was grown in 10 mTorr O2/Ar 

mixed gas atmosphere with 7% O2 mass flow. A 1 mTorr growth pressure with 7 % O2 

mass flow was used in order to examine the effects of possible oxygen vacancies.  

A four-axis goniometer x-ray diffraction (XRD) system with a Cu Kα rotating anode 

was used for structural characterization of the deposited films. Out-of-plane (θ-2θ) and 

grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) scans were performed. Polycrystalline peaks 

of NbO2 were verified from the powder diffraction file PDF# 00-043-1043.21 Film thickness 

and surface roughness analysis were performed on x-ray reflectivity (XRR) data obtained 

from the same x-ray diffraction system.  

The  chemical  composition  of  the  films  was  analyzed  using  x-ray  photoelectron 

spectroscopy  (XPS)  measured  in  a  PHI  5000  VersaProbe  spectrometer  from  Physical 

3 

 
 
Electronics.  The  spectra  were  calibrated  using  C  1s  peak  at  284.8  eV  and  fitted  under 

assumption  of  a  Shirley-type  background.  Areas  under  each  curve  were  compared  to 

obtain molar ratios between different Nb oxides present in the films.  

The  current-voltage  (I-V)  characteristics  were  measured  using  probe  station 

tungsten tips (Picoprobe) from GGB Industries Inc. which were pressed directly on top of 

the film. The nominal lateral size of the probe station tip used was ~2 µm. The voltage 

was applied across the thin film at ramp rates of 0.1 V/sec and the output current was 

measured  across  an  attached  serial  test  resistance  of  Rs  =  51  .  For  pulsed  I-V 

measurements, short triangular ramp pulses were applied to the sample and the output 

current was measured using digital oscilloscope.  

Contact-size dependent I-V measurements were performed with a voltage loop 

frequency of 1 Hz using an atomic force microscopy instrument from Asylum equipped 

with  conducting  platinum  coated  Si  cantilever  tips.  Top  circular  Pt  electrodes  were 

sputtered  to  50  nm  thickness  with  diameters  ranging  from  6.5  μm  to  0.1  μm  using 

electron-beam lithography. 

III. 

Experimental results and discussion  

A.  Structural and chemical analysis 

Figure 1 shows θ-2θ and grazing incidence x-ray diffraction scans of two of the 

NbO2 films grown on TiN/SiO2/Si substrates in 1 and 10 mTorr Ar+O2 (~7% O2) pressures 

and having thicknesses 43.7 and 33.2 nm, respectively. The presence of SiO2 peaks in the 

10  mTorr  sample  are  explained  by  SiO2  crystallization  at  the  growth  substrate 

temperature in an oxygen atmosphere. Note the absence of SiO2 peaks in the film grown 

4 

 
 
in 1 mTorr pressure due to the lower O2 growth pressure. No peaks related to Nb2O5 or 

NbO phases were observed.  

Figure  2  shows  x-ray  reflectivity  curves  for  the  samples  with  thickness  ranging 

from 13.7 to 76.4 nm grown in to 10 mTorr and a 43.7 nm film grown in 1 mTorr (blue 

open circles symbol). Fitting (solid curves) to an optical model was performed using GenX 

software.22 The bottom TiN layer had a thickness of 11 nm with an interface roughness at 

the TiN/NbO2 interface of ~0.4 nm. The maximum surface roughness was approximately 

1 nm for the 76.4 nm thick film. The best fit was achieved assuming an additional top layer 

with approximately 2.7 nm thick which is most likely a Nb2O5 layer formed by oxidation 

of NbO2 after exposure to the atmosphere. The inset in Fig. 2 shows a cross-sectional SEM 

image  of  76.4  nm  film.  All  four  layers  Si,  SiO2,  TiN  and  NbO2  are  visible  with  the 

corresponding  thicknesses  agreeing  with  the  nominal  values. 

It 

is  difficult  to 

unequivocally ascertain whether the top Nb2O5 layer is visible in the SEM image. 

The  molar  content  of  NbO2  and  Nb2O5  phases  was  obtained  using  XPS  spectra 

taken at the 3d core Nb level. XPS spectra measured on the films grown in 1 and 10 mTorr 

total growth pressures are shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. The deconvoluted 

peak fits for the film grown in 10 mTorr pressure show 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks from the Nb4+ 

state at 205.6 and 208.3 eV, respectively, in agreement with previous reports.19,23 Large 

peaks  at  207.1  and  209.8  eV  were  observed  corresponding  to  Nb5+,  probably  due  the 

oxidation  of  the  film  surface  to  Nb2O5  after  exposure  to  the  atmosphere.  The  shaded 

areas  mark  the  peaks  related  to  Nb4+  which  correspond  to  the  NbO2  phase.  The 

approximate content of NbO2 and Nb2O5, was calculated using the area covered by 3d5/2 

5 

 
 
level peaks, and yielded the values of 34.2%/65.8% and 25.1%/74.9% for the films grown 

in 1 and 10 mTorr growth pressures, respectively. Peaks related to Nb2O5 were not visible 

in  XRD  or  GIXRD  spectra  in  Fig.  1.  This  suggests  that  either  the  Nb2O5  top  layer  was 

amorphous  or  at  least  polycrystalline.  Other  authors  have  reported  the  estimated 

thickness  of  the  top  Nb2O5  layer  to  be  2  nm.24  The  exact  estimation  of  the  oxygen 

stoichiometry, however, is difficult via ex-situ measurements due to the possibility of the 

film surface oxidation after exposure to the air.  

B.  Film thickness effect on current threshold switching 

First, we analyzed I-V characteristics measured on NbO2 films [Fig. 4(a)] with film 

thicknesses  of  13.7,  33.2  and  76.4  nm  grown  in  10  mTorr  total  Ar+O2  pressure.  The 

measurements were taken using the probe station tungsten tip as a top electrode and TiN 

layer as a bottom contact. Clear threshold switching in the output current was observed 

and  the  threshold  switching  voltage  (Vth)  depended  linearly  on  the  film  thickness  [Fig. 

4(b)]. The linear dependence of Vth indicated that the ratio between the threshold voltage 

and the thickness, i.e. the threshold electric field, was constant and therefore the bulk 

portion of the film took part in the switching, rather than the metal-oxide interface. This 

contrasts  with  some  other  materials,  for  example  Fe2O3,25  which  have  a  resistive 

switching  behavior  that  is  independent  of  the  film  thickness  because  the  metal-oxide 

interface dominates the switching. The current measured at constant voltage [0.9 V in Fig. 

4(b)], on the other hand, showed an exponential increase with decreasing film thickness. 

As reported by Meyer et al.,26 the mobility (or the drift velocity) of ionic current carriers 

increases  exponentially  with  increasing  applied  electric  field  (i.e.  with  decreasing  film 

6 

 
 
thickness, if the voltage is constant), causing an exponential increase in the current.  Also, 

defects  at  the  film-substrate  interface  contribute  more  to  the  conductivity  in  thinner 

films.  

Low  voltage  (𝑉  <   𝑉𝑡ℎ )  regions  of  I  -  V  curves  of  the  samples  with  different 

thicknesses  were 

fitted 

to  ohmic 

( 𝐼 ~ 𝑉) ,  space-charge-limited  (𝐼 ~ 𝑉2) , 

Schottky [𝐼 ~ exp (𝛽𝑉

1

2)] ,  and  Poole-Frankel  conduction  [𝐼 ~ 𝑉exp (𝛽𝑉1/2)], T =

 constant ]  models  (see  Fig.  4c  for  33.2  nm  film).  For  all  three  thicknesses,  the  P-F 

model27,28  resulted  in  the  best  fits  which  suggests  that  the  high  resistance  state 

conduction  was  due  to  field-assisted  thermal  emission  of  carriers  from  Coulomb  trap 

centers.10  Several  other  authors  also  have  claimed  that  P-F  conduction  dominates  in 

crystalline10 as well as in amorphous films29-31 of NbOx.  

C.  Top contact size effect on current threshold switching 

The dependence of the I-V characteristics on contact size was further investigated 

using  the  conducting  probe  AFM  technique.  For  these  measurements,  the  current 

compliance  was  set to 10  A.  I-V  curves  obtained  from  the 10  mTorr  growth pressure 

sample using top contact diameters 𝑑 ranging from 0.1 μm to 6.5 μm are shown in Fig. 

5(a). Leakage currents measured at 𝑉  =  0.3 V as a function of contact area 𝐴 are shown 

in the Fig. 5(b). The data are fit well on a log-log scale to two power law segments of the 

form ln(𝐼) = 𝑛 ln(𝐴) + 𝐶, where 𝑛 is  the  exponent  in  the  power  law, 𝐴 is  the  contact 

area, and 𝐶 is a constant. For larger area contacts with 𝐴  >  2.8  10−9 cm2, n1 = 0.82  

0.06, or I ~ d2, whereas for smaller area contacts with A  2.8  10-9 cm2, n2 = 0.51  0.02, 

or I ~ d. Thus, below the critical area of A = 2.8  10-9 cm2 [d = 0.6 μm, the dotted line in 

7 

 
 
Fig. 5(b)], the current is proportional to the diameter rather than the area of the contact. 

Similar studies on NbO2/TiOx/NbO2

32 trilayers have revealed that the current depends on 

the electrode area (𝐼 ∝ 𝐴), which implies that the number of carrier traps per unit area, 

which are responsible for the oxide conductivity, is approximately constant. On the other 

hand,  if 𝐼 ∝ 𝐴𝑛  with 𝑛  <  1 (e.g., 𝑛  =  0.3 in  Ref.  32  for  a  low  resistance  state),  the 

current is not uniform across the contact area. In our case, 𝑛  0.5, which may indicate 

that electrode edges are the regions which dominate low-field conduction, in which case 

the current is proportional to the contact’s circumference and therefore 𝐼 ∝ 𝑑 ∝ 𝐴1/2. A 

transformation to 𝑛  1 for diameters 𝑑  >  0.6 m then corresponds to the diminished 

influence  of  the  contact  edge  in  larger  electrodes.  Other  reports12,32  consisted  of 

modifying  the  bottom  electrodes,  and  so  they  could  have  encountered  an  additional 

effect due to different film growth mode in the resistive switching layer. 

In  any  case,  the  dependence  of  current  on  contact  size  is  of  technological 

importance.  In  Si-based  FinFET  devices,  for  example,  reduction  in  device  dimension 

results  in  increased  leakage  current  due  to  the  quantum  tunneling  of  the  electrons 

between the gates. In the case of the NbO2 device, however, lowering the lateral device 

dimension  not  only  increases  the  device  density,  but  also  lowers  the  leakage  current. 

Using the smallest contact size (i.e., AFM tip), the leakage current measured at Vth 1.6 V 

was Ith ~10-6 A which is an order of magnitude lower than reported elsewhere to date.5,11-

13  

8 

 
 
 
 
D.  Effects of Nb5+/Nb4+ content  

We also investigated the effect of O2/Ar total pressure on the I-V characteristics. 

I-V characteristics measured on two films grown in 1 and 10 mTorr growth pressure [Fig. 

6(a)]  were  compared  using  the  top  contact  with  a  diameter  of  0.3  μm.  For  currents 

measured  at  the  same  voltage,  for  example  at  0.2  V,  the  film  grown  in  lower  growth 

pressure (1 mTorr) had a current that was an order of magnitude higher than the one 

measured on the film grown in higher growth pressure (10 mTorr). The larger content of 

insulating Nb2O5 was likely responsible for lower leakage current in the film grown in a 

higher oxygen pressure. On the other hand, a larger defect density, such as O-vacancies, 

might be responsible for increased leakage current for the film grown in a lower growth 

pressure.  Partial  overlap  of  Coulomb  potential  wells  with  increased  trap  density  helps 

lower the barrier height in the P-F model, thus increasing the conductivity. The bulk film 

region might have a small amount of conducting NbO or metallic Nb which might be the 

origin of larger leakage current. It is not possible to estimate exact bulk film stoichiometry 

using ex-situ XPS measurements because of the surface sensitive nature of XPS. NbO or 

metallic Nb on the surface of the film would probably be easily oxidized to NbO2 or Nb2O5 

upon exposure to the atmosphere.  

Our  previous  study  of  NbO2  lateral  devices19,20  demonstrated  that  the  current 

switching was caused by Joule heating from the current flowing through the devices. Prior 

to observing a threshold switching, a forming pulse was needed, requiring the application 

of larger electric field magnitudes than those used during normal operation. It is believed 

that during an electroforming step, an accumulation of defects, such as oxygen vacancies, 

9 

 
 
takes place which creates a conductive path for the current. Our measurements indicate 

that the forming voltage also depends on the contact size. Forming pulses for the film 

grown in 10 mTorr measured using 0.3 μm and 6.5 μm contacts are shown in Fig. 6(b). 

The  data  show  that  larger  diameter  top  contacts  require  a  smaller  voltage  during  the 

electroforming step, in agreement with Ref. 12.  

We  also  compared  the  threshold  switching  behavior  of  these  films.  Figure  7(a) 

shows  a  circuit  diagram  for  pulsed  IV  measurements.  Triangular  voltage  pulses  with 

different  pulse  widths  (τ)  were  applied  across  the  films  and  the  output  current  was 

measured  across  a  test  resistor  Rs.  A  non-linear  current  switching  characteristic  was 

observed for pulse widths    10 μs. Output pulses for both samples for   10 μs are 

plotted in Fig. 7(b) and 7(d). The device from the film grown in 1 mTorr had a smaller turn-

on voltage VON = 1.5 V and a smaller current ON/OFF ratio ( 5) than the one for the device 

from the film grown in 10 mTorr pressure, VON  = 2 V and a ratio  10. This can be explained 

by the more insulating character of the film grown in 10 mTorr. In addition, the device 

made  from  the  film  grown  in  10  mTorr  had  more  abrupt  ON-  and  OFF-switching.  An 

enlarged view of an output current pulse measured on the film grown in 10 mTorr growth 

pressure is shown in Fig. 7(c). The typical OFF-to-ON switching time (ON) was found to be 

25  ns,  which  is  fast  enough  for  a  current  selection  element  in  many  RRAM  device 

prototypes.33  This  result  held  true  for  4  other  samples  grown  using  similar  growth 

conditions.  ON/OFF  switching  times  for  the  film  grown  in  1  mTorr  [Fig.  7(b)]  were 

approximately  twice  as  long  as  the  ON/OFF  times  measured  for  the  films  grown  in  10 

mTorr pressure. Here, the switching time is considered only for extremely sharp region 

10 

 
 
[shaded  region  in  Fig.  7(c)].  Thus,  the  device  from  the  film  with  lower  NbO2  content 

(grown  in  10  mTorr  pressure)  can provide  the better  performance  if used  in  a  current 

switching  element.  Interestingly,  a  current  overshoot  was  observed in  case  of  the film 

grown in 10 mTorr growth pressure [Fig. 7(c) and (d)], which was not observed for one 

grown in 1 mTorr [Fig. 7(b)]. The current overshoot is likely caused by the switching time 

ON being shorter than the associated capacitance (Cp) discharge time (RONCp).34 The fact 

that no overshoot seems to happen for films grown in 1 mTorr pressure is further proof 

of a slower switching behavior. 

We also note that films grown in pressures greater than 10 mTorr had a significant 

amount of the insulating Nb2O5 phase and no threshold switching behavior was observed.  

E.  Self-sustained current oscillations 

Finally, we discuss self-sustained current oscillations in our vertical devices. Figure 

8(a) shows the connection diagram.  The sample was connected in series to a load resistor 

(RL)  of  10  kΩ  and  a  sensing  resistor  (RS)  of  51  Ω;  the  latter  was  used  to  measure  the 

current. The sample is shown as a switchable resistor connected to a parallel capacitor, 

representing the intrinsic capacitance of the insulating (OFF) state. A low frequency input 

voltage (Vin) with a triangular or rectangular wave shape was applied and the output signal 

(i.e. current, Iout) was measured across RS.  

Figure 8(b) shows a current response after a triangular voltage pulse was applied. 

Current oscillations were observed only within the range of the input voltage 2 V < Vin < 5 

V  [red,  dotted  line  in  zoomed  view  of  Fig.  8(b)].  These  oscillations  are  a  result  of  a 

thermally  induced  negative  differential  resistance  region.4,35,36  After  the  film  material 

11 

 
 
temperature increases due to the Joule heating, the current keeps on rising even while 

the input voltage is decreasing. The threshold current is highly unstable in this region, so 

that by choosing appropriate circuit parameters, such as RL and Vin, self-sustained current 

oscillations can be induced.37 

Figure 8(c) shows the output current characteristics of the film grown in 1 mTorr 

and  measured  by  applying  a  rectangular  pulse  with  ~  9  μs  pulse  width  and  4.4  V  in 

amplitude. Before applying Vin, the NbO2 device was in its initial high resistance state, so 

the  associated  capacitor  was  charged  when  the  voltage  was  applied.  The  increase  in 

current  caused  it  to  switch  to  the  low  resistance  state,  resulting  in  a  discharge  of  the 

capacitor. During this step, the largest voltage Vin drop occurred across RL and so the film 

turned itself insulating when the sample voltage was reduced. A rapid repetition of the 

process provided oscillations in the output current. 

Highly stable oscillations were obtained during positive and negative cycles of the 

input  voltage.  Oscillations  lasted  over  48  hours  (1012  cycles)  with  5%  fluctuation  in 

frequency  and  33%  fluctuation  in  amplitude,  which  is  the  most  stable  oscillator  so  far 

reported for NbO2. The peak-to-peak amplitude (Ipp) of current oscillations was about 1.1 

mA. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the signal showed that the first order frequency 

component was at 11 MHz [Fig. 8(c)] for an input voltage of 4.5 V.  

We studied the dependence of the oscillation frequency on input voltage in films 

grown at 1 and 10 mTorr total growth pressures, i.e. in films with different NbO2-content 

(Fig. 9). A closer view of oscillations is shown in the inset to Fig. 9 with similar frequencies 

12 

 
 
of  11 MHz for both films. Aside from the main frequency oscillations, other harmonics 

were present.  

For the film grown in 1 mTorr, the range of Vin where oscillations were observed 

was found to be between 2.5 V to 4.8 V, in agreement with the study on the same film 

under triangular pulse application [Fig. 8(b)]. The oscillation frequency fosc increased upon 

increasing  input  voltage  amplitude  Vin  until  Vin  =  4  V.  Upon  further  increase  of  Vin,  fosc 

started  to  decrease  and  oscillations  disappeared.  Lalevic  et  al.  have  reported  a  similar 

trend  in  frequency  variation:  linear  increment  followed  by  a  saturated  region  using 

polycrystalline thin film devices.38 For the film grown in 10 mTorr, the frequency increased 

linearly with increasing Vin and no saturation region existed. The range of Vin resulting in 

stable oscillations for the film was higher, between 4 V and 7.5 V. Because of the lower 

NbO2 content, the film grown in 10 mTorr pressure had higher threshold voltage and thus 

a larger range of Vin which produced oscillations.  

IV. 

Conclusions  

In conclusion, we studied structural and electric properties of NbO2 films grown 

on  TiN  coated  SiO2/Si  substrate  using  different  growth  pressures.  θ-2θ  and  grazing 

incidence  x-ray  diffractometry  verified  the  polycrystalline  growth  of  NbO2.  Threshold 

switching voltage (Vth) showed thickness dependence and off-state leakage current was 

described by the Poole-Frenkel conduction mechanism. The threshold switching behavior 

of the device depended on the contact size, with a dependence on the diameter of the 

contact for small contacts and on the area for large contacts. Pulsed I-V measurements 

performed on the sample grown in 10 mTorr pressure showed a current switching time 

13 

 
 
of  ~25  ns.  Highly  stable  self-oscillatory  current  behavior  with  oscillation  frequencies 

above  5  MHz  were  demonstrated.  Higher  Nb2O5  content  resulted  in  self-sustained 

oscillations of higher frequencies.

Figure 1: X-ray diffraction spectra. θ-2θ (black and blue curves) and grazing incidence x-
ray diffraction (GIXRD) (red and green curves) patterns of NbO2 films grown in 1 (green 
and blue curves) and 10 mTorr (red and black curves) total pressure. Sharp peaks denoted 
by ‘●’ and ‘↓’ are from (100) Si and (010) SiO2, respectively. The grazing incidence angle 
was 𝛼 = 30.   

Figure 2: X-ray reflectivity (XRR) data (open circles) for NbO2 films with the corresponding 
fits (solid lines). All films were grown in 10 mTorr total pressure, except the 43.7 nm film 
grown in 1mTorr total pressure. Inset figure shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the 
76.4 nm thin film.

films grown in 1 mTorr (a) and 10 mTorr (b) growth pressures  with deconvoluted peak 
fits. The shaded areas are the contribution from the Nb4+ valency state. The molar content 
of  NbO2/Nb2O5,  estimated  using  areas  covered  by  3d5/2  level  speaks,  was  found  as 
34.2%/65.8% and 25.1%/74.9% for the film grown in 1 and 10 mTorr, respectively.
