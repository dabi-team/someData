We  found  that  carbon-associated  byproducts  formed  at  the  dry-oxidized  SiO2/SiC(0001) 

interface could be decomposed and be taken out to the SiO2 side by high-purity Ar annealing. 

We evaluated the concentration of the ejected carbon atoms in the SiO2 by secondary ion mass 

spectrometry, and discovered that it clearly depends on the condition of oxide formation (dry-

oxidation, nitridation treatment, and phosphorus treatment). This work provides an indirect but 

unambiguous evidence for the carbon-byproducts existing at the SiO2/SiC interfaces, and also 

indicates that the phosphorus treatment removes the carbon-byproducts, leading to significant 

reduction of interface defects.

    Silicon carbide (SiC) has been regarded as a suitable material for sustainable power electronics 

owing to its superior physical properties such as high critical electric field and wide bandgap.1,2) The 

key device for power conversion, SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) 

have, however, suffered from the low channel mobility due to the extremely high interface state density 

(Dit > 1013 cm-2eV-1) of silicon dioxide (SiO2)/SiC systems.2-5) 

It has been believed that carbon-related byproducts created at the interface during the oxidation 

are  the  candidate  of  the  interface  defects.2,5-8)  However,  direct  detection  of  the  carbon  byproducts 

possibly residing at (or near) the interface has not been straightforward. Structural analyses based on 

x-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and so on, have been 

performed to clarify the microscopic picture of the SiO2/SiC interface so far.2) However, these results 

are not always consistent to each other. Studies based on high-resolution XPS,9-11) for instance, indicate 

that the interface is abrupt, and there exist only a few monolayers of sub-oxides.11) Regarding studies 

based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM)/EELS,12,13) one group showed a carbon-rich layer 

near the interface,12) while another group insists that the interface is abrupt and that the existence of a 

transition  layer  is  hard  to  detect  by  EELS.13)  The  result  of  high-resolution  medium  energy  ion 

scattering (MEIS) also shows that the interface is fairly abrupt.14) These contradictions arise from the 

essential difficulty of the interface analysis. In normal structural analyses, such as XPS or EELS, the 

detection limit of foreign atoms is 0.3–1% of the host atoms.2) Conversely, the imperfection of 0.1% 

2 

 
of  the  host  atoms  will  cause  a  huge  number  of  electronic  defects,  which  affect  the  electronic 

characteristics of the system. 

  Furthermore, most of the structural analyses focus on a single (or particular) sample(s) and very 

few of those deal with various samples owning different defect densities. Post-oxidation annealing 

(POA) such as interface nitridation (annealing in nitric oxide, NO15,16) or N2O17,18)) or POCl3 annealing 

(annealing in a gas mixture of POCl3, O2, and N2

19,20)) is effective in passivating the interface defects. 

The underlying physics of reduction of the interface states owing to the POA has not yet been clarified, 

and thus it is important to reveal how the interface structure is changed when the oxidation or POA 

conditions are varied. 

    In  this  work,  we  succeeded  in  detecting  the  existence  of  carbon-associated  byproducts  at  the 

SiC(0001)  MOS  interface  indirectly  but  unambiguously.  We  discovered  that  it  is  possible  to 

decompose the carbon-byproducts and take them out to the SiO2 side by thermal annealing alone. We 

also  found  that  the  density  of  the  ejected  carbon  atoms  by  the  annealing  strongly  depends  on  the 

condition  of  gate  oxide  formation  (dry  oxidation,  NO  annealing,  and  POCl3  annealing).  From  the 

obtained results, the mechanisms of interface passivation by NO and POCl3 are discussed.   

The samples employed in this study were 4H-SiC(0001) MOS structures. The doping density of 

the n-type epilayer was about 1×1016 cm-3. After standard RCA cleaning, dry oxidation was carried 

out at 1300˚C for 30–40 min. Subsequent NO annealing (10% diluted in N2) or POCl3 annealing (in a 

3 

 
gas mixture of POCl3, O2, and N2) were performed at 1250˚C for 70 min or at 1000˚C for 10 min, 

respectively. After  the  POCl3  annealing,  N2  annealing  was  carried  out  at  1000˚C  for  30  min.  To 

evaluate the Dit distribution of the MOS structures, MOS capacitors were fabricated with circular Al 

electrodes with a diameter of about 500 μm. The Dit was evaluated by a high-low method from the C-

V characteristics of the MOS capacitors. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was performed to 

monitor the carbon or nitrogen profile in SiC/SiO2 systems. The primary ion species and the energies 

of the ions were O2

+, 8 keV for carbon detection and Cs+, 2 keV for nitrogen detection. The conversion 

of the measured secondary C ion counts to the C atom concentration was accomplished using a relative 

sensitivity factor determined by measuring a reference C-implanted SiO2 sample. To cause diffusion 

of carbon species from the interface, annealing in high-purity Ar with a very low partial pressure of 

O2 (pO2) was performed in this study. The Ar gas was supplied from an Ar cylinder (pO2 < 2 ppm) and 

then  purified  to  obtain  very  low  pO2 (<  100  ppt).  Note  that  the  low  pO2  is  a  very  important  factor 

because the carbon atoms ejected during the annealing are easily transformed into gas species (CO or 

CO2) when they meet O2 inside the SiO2.   

Figure 1 shows the measured 1 MHz and quasi-static C-V characteristics for the MOS structures 

(as-oxidized, NO-annealed, and POCl3-annealed) prepared in this study. Large frequency dispersion 

appears in the sample oxidized at 1300˚C, which is suppressed to some extent by the NO annealing at 

1250˚C, and after the POCl3 annealing at 1000˚C, the frequency dispersion almost disappeared. From

5×1011 cm-2 (negative) for the as-oxidized sample, 1×1011 cm-2 (negative) for the NO-annealed one, 

and  3×1011  cm-2  (positive)  for  the  POCl3-annealed  one.  Figure  2  shows  the  interface  state  density 

evaluated  by  a  high(1  MHz)-low  method  for  the  MOS  structures  (as-oxidized,  NO-annealed,  and 

POCl3-annealed).  The  Dit  is  highest  in  the  as-oxidized  sample,  then  in  the  NO-annealed  one,  and 

lowest in the POCl3-annealed one, which agrees with a previous report.19)   

    Then the MOS structures were annealed in high-purity Ar, and the carbon (and nitrogen) profile 

was  evaluated  by  SIMS.  Figure  3  shows  the  evaluated  profile  of  carbon  concentration  for  the  as-

oxidized (1300˚C) sample and that after Ar annealing at 1300˚C for 1 min. We can see that the carbon

concentration  in  SiO2  was  close  to  the  detection  limit  (~  1018  cm-3)  in  the  as-oxidized  sample.  In 

contrast, after pure Ar annealing at 1300˚C for 1 min, high concentration of carbon (> 1020 cm-3) was 

detected inside the oxide. This result clearly indicates that the carbon-related byproducts exist at the 

as-oxidized MOS interface, and that the byproducts are decomposed and could be taken out to the 

SiO2-side by thermal annealing alone. By integrating the carbon profile over the depth, we found that 

the carbon concentration in SiO2 after the annealing is very high when converted into area density (~ 

6×1014 cm-2).   

    The post-oxidation annealing in NO is effective in both reducing the frequency dispersion of C-

V curves and the interface state density, as shown in Figs.1 and 2. Then, we performed Ar annealing

The evaluated depth profiles of the carbon (and nitrogen) concentration are depicted in Fig.4. In the 

case of the NO-annealed sample, the carbon concentration in SiO2 after Ar annealing at 1300˚C for 1 

min, was close to the detection limit (~ 1018 cm-3). After Ar annealing at 1300˚C for 5 min, however, 

high concentration of carbon is observed in the oxide (> 1020 cm-3), which is comparable to or even a 

higher value than the case of the dry oxidized and Ar annealed (1300˚C, 1 min) sample (shown in 

Fig.3). This result suggests that the main effect of NO annealing is not the removal of the carbon-

byproducts at the interface. In the nitrogen profile after the Ar annealing at 1300˚C for 5 min, we see 

that the high concentration of nitrogen (~ 1021 cm-3) is localized near the interface, and this value is 

close to that just after the NO annealing.21) In addition, the nitrogen concentration inside the oxide is 

around the detection limit (~ 1018 cm-3) which is lower than the carbon concentration (> 1020 cm-3) by 

more than two orders of  magnitude. From these results, it  is likely that the nitrogen atoms are not 

directly attached to the carbon byproducts by the NO annealing.   

Regarding the origin of defect passivation owing to the NO annealing, it is suggested that the 

nitrogen atoms are doped in the SiC region near the interface and operate as donors, leading to

formation of a very thin n+ region in the SiC near the interface.22) Due to the formation of an n+ region 

and resulting easier electron accumulation, surface band bending (or electric field) is overestimated in 

the Dit analysis. This leads to underestimation of the energy difference between the surface Fermi level 

and the conduction band edge (and thus EC−ET in Fig.2), which results in apparently lower defect 

densities.  Such  explanation  does  not  conflict  with  our  experimental  facts.  However,  further 

investigations are required to clarify the mechanism of passivation owing to the nitridation process. 

    As shown in Figs.1 and 2, POCl3 annealing is more effective than NO annealing in passivating 

the interface defects. The POCl3-annealed MOS structures were further annealed in Ar, to investigate

the mechanism of the observed defect passivation. The depth profiles of the carbon concentration are 

shown in Fig.5. Unlike as-oxidized or NO-annealed samples, the carbon concentration detected in the 

oxide after  the Ar annealing  at  1300˚C  for  1–5  min  was  close  to  the  detection  limit  (~  1018  cm-3). 

Furthermore,  even  after  annealing  at  higher  temperatures  (1400˚C  and  1500˚C),  carbon  was  not 

detected.  It  should  be  noted  that,  in  the  case  of  as-oxidized  or  NO-annealed  samples,  the  oxides 

completely  sublimed  by  annealing  at  1400˚C  for  1  min,  and  thus  we  speculate  that  the  oxide 

sublimation process at such low oxygen pressure is related to destruction of the SiO2 network due to 

the diffusion of carbon species from the interface. In the case of POCl3-annealed sample, the diffusion 

of  the  carbon  atoms does  not  occur,  which  keeps  a  solid  network  of  the  oxide,  and  thus the  oxide 

survives even after Ar annealing at 1500˚C. 

From the above experimental results, it is highly likely that the majority of the carbon-associated 

byproducts induced  during  the  oxidation  process  are  removed  by  the subsequent POCl3 annealing, 

leading to significant reduction of interface defects as shown in Fig.2. Such conclusion agrees with 

our recent prediction based on static and dynamic density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations.23)   

    In summary, we compared the concentration of the ejected carbon atoms from as-oxidized, NO-

annealed,  and  POCl3-annealed  SiC(0001)  MOS  interfaces  by  high-purity  Ar  annealing  at  1300–

1500˚C. The carbon concentrations detected in the oxide after the annealing were very high (> 1020 

cm-3) in the case of as-oxidized or NO-annealed samples. The results not only indicate the existence 

10 

 
of  high  concentration  of  carbon-associated  byproducts  at  the  as-oxidized  MOS  interface,  but  also 

suggest  that  the NO  annealing  is not  removing  the byproducts  themselves.  In  contrast,  the  ejected 

carbon  concentration  was  close  to  the  detection  limit  (~  1018  cm-3)  in  the  case  of  POCl3-annealed 

sample. Thus, it is highly likely that the POCl3 annealing is removing the carbon-related byproducts 

from the interface. This work provides an important data in revealing the microscopic picture of the 

SiC  MOS  interface and  explaining  the quality  change of  the  interface owing  to  the post-oxidation 

annealing.
