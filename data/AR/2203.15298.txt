ABSTRACT 

Wind speed modelling and prediction has been gaining importance because of its significant roles in various stages of 
wind energy management. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model, based on wavelet transform to improve the accuracy of the 
short-term  forecast.  The  wind  speed  time  series  are  split  into  various  frequency  components  using  waveletdecomposition 
technique,  and each frequency  components are modelled separately.  Since the components associated  withthe  high- frequency 
range  shows  stochastic  nature,  we  modelled  them  with  autoregressive  (AR)  method  and  rest  of  low-frequencycomponents 
modelled with support vector machine (SVM). The results of the hybrid method show a promisingimprovement in accuracy of 
wind speed prediction compared to that of stand-alone AR or SVM model.

As  a  renewable  source  of  energy,  the  wind  is 
considered as a key solution to reach a sustainable future. 
At the end of 2016, worldwide total installed wind power

increasing,  and  by  2030  is  expected  to  reach  2,110  GW 
supplying  20%  of  global  electricity,  (GWEC  2014).  In  a 
local scenario, India is in the fourth position in the global 
wind  industry with a total installed  capacity  of31 GW  by 
the  end  of  2016  and  also  expecting  639  GW  of  installed

In  general,  wind  speed  forecasting  methods  can 
be  classified 
two:  physical  models  such  as 
NumericalWeather  Prediction  model  (NWP)  and  time 
series models such as Autoregressive (AR) model, (Soman 
location  specific, 
et  al.2010).  Physical  models  are 
mathematically  complex,  computationally  intensive  and 
timeconsuming  making  themunreliable  for  short  and 
medium 
(Potter 
&Negnevitsky2006,  Candy  et  al.  2009).  Time  series 
analysis  methodologies  are  generally  considered  as 
suitable  for  modellingany  natural  system  from 
its 
historical  data  and  hence  are  fit  to  derive  a  good 
description of highly intermittentwind speed data. The use 
of statistical methods in explaining the random variation in 
wind speed datais available in the literature. The capability 
of  Gaussian  distribution  to  characterise  wind  over  time 
explainedby,  (Brown  et  al.  1984)  was  the  first  attempt  in 
this  direction.  Assuming  wind  as  a  stochastic  process 
manyother statistical models such as AR, ARMA, ARIMA 
and  some  probability  distribution  based  models  are 
alsoexperimented  to  explain  wind  speed  oscillations, 
(Kamal & Jafri 1997, Cadenas& Rivera 2007, Kavasseri & 
Seetharaman  2009,  Hennessey  Jr  1977,  Celik  2004, 
Mathew et al. 2011, Jiang et al. 2013). Investigationsbased 
on  data  mining  models  such  as  Artificial  Neural

(Beyer  et  al.  1994).  Hybrid  methods

SUPPORT  VECTOR  REGRESSION  MODEL 
OF PREDICTION 

Support  vector  machines  (SVM)  are  a  class  of 
machine learning methods used for both classification and 
regression first introduced by Vladimir Vapnik. The basic 
idea of SVM is to construct the higher dimensional hyper 
planes  from  the  given  input  data  using  kernal  functions 
and  choose  the  largest  seperation  betweenhyper  planes  to 
decide which class a new data point will be in, (Weston et 
al. 2001). The basic form  of  supportvector regression can 
be expressed as

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

in  Fig.2(a) 

Wind speed observations are known for its highly 
varying  oscillations  on  very  different  time  scales.  A 
typical  graphical  representation  of  this  highly  variable 
wind  speed  fluctuations  is  shown  in  Fig.1.  Our  previous 
frequency  level  analysis  of  dynamical  behaviour  of  wind 
speed  oscillations,  (Drisya  et  al.  2017)  show  that,  at 
different  scales  the  underlyingdynamics  can  be  classified 
as  stochastic,  chaotic  and  deterministic  processes.  The 
reported 
the  suitabilityof  different 
modelling techniques at each of the frequency components 
of  the  original  time  series.As  a  first  step  we  applied  the 
discrete wavelet transform with Daubechies wavelet on the 
measured time series data, to decompose it into 10 wavelet 
components,  9  detailed  components  and  one  smooth 
level  frequency 
series.  As  seen 
components  levels  up  to  3  shows  a  complexbehaviour 
suggesting  the  stochasting  nature  of  thecomponents.  The 
complex  dynamics  seen  in  the  intermediate  levels  of  the 
decomposed  series,  Fig.2(b),  is  due  its  chaoticnature, 
(Drisya  et  al.  2017)  and 
low  frequency 
components depicted in Fig.3 are essentially deterministic 
innature.  The  stochastic  process  is  modelled  using  AR 
method  as  given  in  Eq.7  assuming  that  there  exist  some 
amountof  correlation  with  the  previous  values.  Since  the 
wavelet  components  beyond  high  frequency  levels  are 
deterministicin  nature  these  signals  are  expected  to  be 
better  predicted  with  deterministic  models.  Machine 
learning  methods  aresuitable  for  modelling  deterministic 
dynamics  because  of  their  ability  to  capture  the  order 
present  in  the  data.  Fig.4  showsthe  prediction  made  with 
simple  AR  method  and  the  predictions  made  with  the 
proposed  hybrid  model,  AR  techniquein  high  frequency 
wavelet components and SVM in low frequency level and 
it  is  evident  that  the  results  from  hybridmethod  improves 
the  prediction  accuracy  significantly.For  validating  the 
results  we  extended  our  analysis  and  predictionto  several

For  the  available  data,  6  hrs  ahead  prediction  is 
done at a 1 week interval for the 3-year period from 2004 
to 2006. Timeseries data measured at the month January of 
the  year 2004 were used for  model  building and all  other 
predictions  aredone  with  this  constructed  model.  The 
RMSE values calculated are shown in Fig.5 and it is clear 

that  for  most  of  thepredictions  upto  6  hr  the  RMSE  is 
below  2:5  (m/s)  and  only  a  few  prediction  errors  go 
beyond  this.  The  average  RMSEfor  6  hr  prediction  is 
shown  as  dotted  lines  in  Fig.5  and  it  indicates  that  the 
proposed hybrid model can predict windspeed oscillations 
with  an  average  error  of  1:5  (m/s).  Even  though  wind 
speed  oscillations  shows  different  dynamics  indifferent 
time  scale,  suitable  modelling 
techniques  at  each 
frequency  level  can  significantly  reduce  the  prediction 
error. 

CONCLUSION 

Since  the  amount  of  power  produced  at  given 
time  is  a  direct  function  of  the  wind  speed  measured, 
accurate  prediction  of  wind  speed  has  got  wider 
application  in  wind  energy  management.  Most  of  the 
methods for predicting wind speed time series found in the 
literature  are 
it  could  never 
accommodate the varying dynamical behaviour atdifferent 
time scale of the wind speed oscillations. In this work, we 
report  that  the  use  of  a  hybrid  method,  consideringthe 
varying dynamics at different levels and applying suitable 
modelling  techniques,  can  remarkably  improve  forecast 
accuracy.
