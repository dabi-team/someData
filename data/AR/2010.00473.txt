Abstract

Using the photon-ion merged-beams technique at a synchrotron light source, we have measured
relative cross sections for single and up to ﬁve-fold photoionization of Fe2+ ions in the energy range
690–920 eV. This range contains thresholds and resonances associated with ionization and excitation
of 2p and 2s electrons. Calculations were performed to simulate the total absorption spectra. The
theoretical results show very good agreement with the experimental data, if overall energy shifts of up
to 2.5 eV are applied to the calculated resonance positions and assumptions are made about the initial
experimental population of the various levels of the Fe2+([Ar]3d6) ground conﬁguration. Furthermore,
we performed extensive calculations of the Auger cascades that result when an electron is removed from
the 2p subshell of Fe2+. These computations lead to a better agreement with the measured product-
charge-state distributions as compared to earlier work. We conclude that the L-shell absorption features
of low-charged iron ions are useful for identifying gas-phase iron in the interstellar medium and for
discriminating against the various forms of condensed-phase iron bound to composite interstellar dust
grains.

1. INTRODUCTION

L-shell photoionization data of

low-charged iron
ions are required to reliably assess the abundance
of
iron in the interstellar medium (ISM) from as-
tronomical x-ray observations. Resonant L-shell ab-
sorption features oﬀer
the possibility to discrimi-
nate between iron in the gas phase and iron that
is chemically bound in dust grains.
Absorption
data for chemically bound iron are available from
the literature (e.g., Kortright & Kim 2000; Lee et al.
2009; Miedema & de Groot 2013; Westphal et al. 2019).

However, corresponding experimental data for low-
charged iron ions had been missing. In order to ﬁll this
gap we have launched a campaign to provide absorp-
tion data for Fe+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ ions using photon-
ion merged-beams measurements at a synchrotron light
source and accompanying theoretical calculations. Re-
sults for Fe+ and Fe3+ ions have already been pub-
lished by Schippers et al. (2017) and Beerwerth et al.
(2019), respectively. The photoabsorption cross-section
of neutral Fe0 had already been measured previously by
Richter et al. (2004).

In this work, we present our measurements of relative
cross sections for up to ﬁve fold ionization of Fe2+ ions
via ionization or excitation of the L-shell. These data
provide, in particular, accurate information on the po-
sitions and shapes of photoionization resonances associ-

ated with the excitation of a 2p electron. The data will
also facilitate a reliable identiﬁcation of Fe2+ absorp-
tion features in, for example, astrophysical x-ray spec-
tra. Furthermore, extensive quantum theoretical cal-
culations to simulate the experimental spectra and to
identify the dominant decay channels were performed.
These results are vital for determining the charge bal-
ance and elemental abundance in astrophysical plasmas.
The Fe+ and Fe3+ papers (Schippers et al. 2017;
Beerwerth et al. 2019) provide an extended motivation
for these investigations and a comprehensive discus-
sion of the related literature. Therefore, the present
paper conﬁnes itself primarily to the aspects that are
speciﬁc for L-shell photoionization and photoabsorp-
tion of Fe2+. Previous work on L-shell photoioniza-
tion of Fe2+ ions reported theoretical calculations of
cross sections for direct photoionization of a L-shell
electron (Reilman & Manson 1979; Verner et al. 1993)
and theoretical calculations of the deexcitation cascades
that evolve after the removal of a 2s or a 2p electron
(Kaastra & Mewe 1993; Kuˇcas et al. 2019, 2020).

2. EXPERIMENT

The experiment was performed at the end sta-
tion PIPE (Schippers et al. 2014; M¨uller et al. 2017;
Schippers et al. 2020) of the photon beamline P04
(Viefhaus et al. 2013) at the synchrotron light source
PETRA III which is operated by DESY in Hamburg,
Germany. As for our previous work on L-shell pho-
toionization of Fe+ and Fe3+ (Schippers et al. 2017;
Beerwerth et al. 2019), we have employed the photon-
ion merged-beams technique (for recent overviews see
Schippers et al. 2016a; Schippers & M¨uller 2020) to
measure cross sections for single and multiple pho-
toionization of Fe2+ ions. The experimental photon-
energy range was 690–920 eV. The photon-energy band-
width was about 1.0 eV corresponding to the full-width-
at-half-maximum (FWHM) of a Gaussian distribution
function. The maximum energy-dependent photon ﬂux
was 8 × 1013 s−1. For an accurate determination of the
photon energy scale, the same calibration was used as
for the measurements with Fe+ (Schippers et al. 2017),
taking into account the diﬀerences in the Doppler shift
between the faster Fe2+ ions and the slower Fe+ ions.
The remaining one-sigma uncertainty of the experimen-
tal photon-energy scale is ±0.2 eV.

The Fe2+ ion beam was produced by leaking fer-
rocene, Fe(C5H5)2, vapor into an electron-cyclotron res-
onance (ECR) ion source (Schlapp et al. 1995) oper-
ated on an electrostatic potential of 6 kV. The ex-
tracted ion beam was mass/charge analyzed by passing
it through a double-focussing dipole magnet. Figure 1

shows the composition of the ion beam as a function
of mass-to-charge ratio with mass measured in atomic
mass units and charge in the elementary charge unit.
This mass/charge spectrum was obtained by scanning
the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the analyzing magnet and
simultaneously recording the ion current collected in a
Faraday cup. The 56Fe2+ signal occurs at a mass-to-
charge ratio of 28. Other species, such as CO+ and
C2H+
4 are also expected to contribute to the measured
ion current at this mass/charge ratio. Pure Fe2+ beams
could be obtained for the isotope 57Fe, but only at a
much reduced ion current due to the relatively low nat-
ural abundance of this isotope of only 2.1% (Meija et al.
2016). The 56Fe2+ (including contaminants) and 57Fe2+
ion currents were up to 27 nA and 0.12 nA, respectively.
As described previously for single and multiple ion-
ization of Fe+ ions (Schippers et al. 2017), relative cross
sections σm for m-fold ionization (m = 1 − 5) were mea-
sured individually for each product ion Feq+ with charge
state q = m + 2. To this end, the product ions were
magnetically separated from the primary ion beam and
directed onto a detector operated in the single-particle
counting mode. This charge separation ensured that
any photoionized products from the contaminants of the
56Fe2+ primary ion beam did not reach the product-ion
detector. For most of the present measurements, the po-
tentially contaminated 56Fe2+ beam was used, as it de-
livered much higher photoionization signals than those
obtained using a pure 57Fe2+ beam. Relative cross sec-
tions were measured with the isotope 57Fe at a few se-
lected photon energies and the 56Fe2+ data were scaled
to match the 57Fe2+ relative cross sections.

In principle, the PIPE setup permits photoionization
cross sections to be placed on an absolute scale, as

cross section for photoabsorption (see text).

Photon energy (eV)

was achieved in our work on photoionization of Fe+
ions (Schippers et al. 2017). This requires measuring
the spatial proﬁles of the ion beam and the photon
beam, from which the geometrical beam overlap fac-
tor can be obtained. For Fe3+, such measurements
could not be carried out because of a technical problem
that could not be solved within the allocated beamtime
(Beerwerth et al. 2019). Since the Fe2+ and the Fe3+
data were taken during the same beamtime, absolute
cross sections could not be measured for Fe2+ as well.
Following the same approach as for the Fe3+ data, we
multiplied the relative cross sections by a common factor
such that the cross-section sum

matches the theoretical absorption cross section of
Verner et al. (1993) at 690 eV (see below). The im-
plicit assumption that σΣ in Equation 1 represents the
Fe2+ absorption cross section is justiﬁed because all sig-
niﬁcant reaction channels were measured. This nor-
malization procedure was motivated by the fact that
the absolute experimental cross section for photoabsorp-
tion of Fe+ agrees with the corresponding theoretical
cross section of Verner et al. (1993) within the ±15% to-
tal experimental uncertainty at a 90% conﬁdence level
(Schippers et al. 2017).

For a deeper insight into the experimental ﬁndings,

Schippers et al.

(Grant 2007) and the Hartree-Fock method with rel-
ativistic extensions (HFR, Cowan 1981). The use of
these methods has been described more extensively in
our publications on photoionization of Fe+ and Fe3+
(Schippers et al. 2017; Beerwerth et al. 2019). Here,
these methods were used to calculate Fe2+ absorption
cross sections, accounting for direct ionization of a 2p
electron and for the excitation of a 2p electron from
the Fe2+(1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d6) ground conﬁgurations
to higher nd and n′s subshells. We included 3 ≤ n ≤ 5
and 4 ≤ n′ ≤ 5 in the MCDF calculations. In the HFR
calculations, we have only considered 2p → 3d excita-
tions and direct 2p ionization, the latter of which was
not included in the MCDF calculations.

The MCDF computational tools allow for the mod-
elling of the deexcitation pathways due to Auger cascade
processes that accompany the initial creation of a 2p
hole. Since the focus of our investigations is on the reso-
nance features that are associated with 2p excitation, we
did not consider cascades initiated by 2s-hole creation.
We used the Grasp2k (J¨onsson et al. 2007) program
package to generate the approximate wave functions and
employed the tools of the Ratip code (Fritzsche 2001,
2012) to compute the required cross sections and transi-
tion rates. The same approach was used for Fe2+ as was
used in our work on Fe3+ (Beerwerth et al. 2019), where
more details are given. Brieﬂy, the cascade includes
all energetically allowed (two-electron) Auger processes
where one of the electrons ﬁlls a lower subshell and an-
other is ejected from the ion. In addition we accounted
for three-electron Auger decays where a third electron
undergoes a shake-down transition. The inclusion of
these generally weak decay channels has been found to
be essential to explain the highest product charge states
obtained experimentally (Schippers et al. 2016a, 2017;
Beerwerth et al. 2019). In order to keep the computa-
tions manageable, we assume that the radiative losses
are negligible, i.e., that all levels that are energetically
allowed to autoionize will do so. Cascades initiated by
direct L-shell ionization of Fe2+ were previously cal-
culated by Kaastra & Mewe (1993) and more recently
by Kuˇcas et al. (2019, 2020). In Section 4.1 below, we
compare the results from these earlier studies with the
present calculations.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Our measured cross sections σm (1 ≤ m ≤ 5) for sin-
gle and multiple (up to ﬁve-fold) photoionization of Fe2+
ions are plotted in Figure 2 and also provided in Tab. 1
in numerical form. At photon energies of 690–750 eV,
the dominant process is double ionization (m = 2). Up
to ∼749 eV, a bound-bound transition forms a hole that

can relax by emission of one or more electrons (with two
being the dominant mode). Above ∼749 eV, a bound-
free transition changes the charge state by one and forms
a hole that can relax by emission of one or more electrons
(with two being the dominant mode). In the theoretical
cross sections of Verner et al. (1993), this threshold for
direct 2p ionization occurs at 745.1 eV (Figure 3). The
most obvious signature of this threshold in our data is
the step-like decrease of the single-ionization cross sec-
tion (magenta symbols in Fig. 2) that sets in for energies
&749 eV. Below this threshold, a 2p electron can only
be resonantly excited to a higher partially occupied or
unoccupied subshell, i.e, the primary photon-ion inter-
action does not change the charge state of the ion. At
higher energies above the 2p threshold, a 2p electron
can be directly ionized. This primary process increases
the ion charge state by one.
In both cases, a 2p hole
is created. The subsequent deexcitation of the multiply
excited 2p-hole conﬁgurations proceeds via a cascade of
autoionization and radiative processes that produces the
observed distributions over the various measured prod-
uct charge states as already sketched in Section 3 and
as will be discussed in more detail below.

oretical absorption cross section of Verner et al. (1993).
As explained above, the experimental cross-section scale
was normalized to the theoretical one at a photon en-
ergy of about 690 eV. The theoretical cross section of
Verner et al. (1993) does not contain any contribution
from resonant photoionization. Thus,
it clearly dis-
plays the calculated 2p and 2s thresholds at 745.1 and
863.1 eV, respectively. Comparatively weak signatures
for the 2s ionization threshold can also be seen in the
experimental data in Figs. 2 and 3. However, in the ex-
perimental cross sections the thresholds are blurred by
resonances associated with 2p and 2s excitation.

The dominant features in all measured cross sections
are the two broad resonance structures at around 708
and 720 eV which can be attributed to 2p → 3d exci-
tations. The ∼12 eV energy diﬀerence between these
two structures corresponds to the 2p1/2, 3/2 spin-orbit
splitting. This splitting is reproduced by our present
HFR calculations which are also displayed in Figure 3.
As already mentioned, the HFR calculations account for
2p → 3d excitations, but do not include the weaker reso-
nances at higher energies, which are predominantly asso-
ciated with 2p → nd excitations to higher subshells with
n ≥ 4. Hence, the HFR results lie below the measure-
ments from ∼730–760 eV. The HFR calculations also
account for direct 2p ionization, which is the dominant
contribution to the Fe2+ absorption cross section at en-
ergies above 760 eV and continuing up to the highest
experimental photon energy studied here.

diﬀerent levels. Our MCDF and HFR calculations were
carried out for all individual levels of the ground con-

for a Boltzmann distribution of energy levels for a tem-
perature of 30,000 K. Figure 4c contains theoretical re-
sults for a statistical mixture of all levels pertaining to
the Fe2+ ground conﬁguration, where where the popu-
lation of each level is weighted by its degeneracy. Ap-
parently, the latter provides the best agreement with
the experimental absorption cross section, if the theo-
retical resonance positions are uniformly shifted by -2.5
and -1.0 eV in case of the HFR and the MCDF cal-
culations, respectively. Similar shifts were applied to
the corresponding theoretical results for Fe+ and Fe3+
(Schippers et al. 2017; Beerwerth et al. 2019).

As already mentioned, the HFR calculations account
for direct 2p ionization and 2p → 3d excitation. Un-
der the assumption of a statistical initial level distribu-
tion, the calculated cross section agrees rather well with
the experimental absorption cross section in the energy
range of the photoionization resonances that are asso-
ciated with the 2p → 3d excitation. The resonances
above ∼726 eV are related to the excitation of a 2p
electron to higher subshells such as the 2p → 4d and
2p → 5d excitations that were included in the MCDF
calculations. But for the MCDF calculations, the agree-
ment between the computed and experimental resonance
structure is less satisfying, as compared to the HFR cal-
culations (Figure 4). This is attributed to the rather
limited consideration of conﬁguration interaction by the
present MCDF calculations, which were more geared to-
wards the simulation of the deexcitation cascades that
set in after the initial creation of the 2p hole and that
are discussed next.

Figure 5 shows our experimental and theoretical prod-
uct charge-state fractions following Fe2+ photoioniza-
tion. Our MCDF calculations only account for cascades
that follow the initial creation of a 2p, 3s, or 3p hole.
Therefore, our theoretical values only apply to energies
below the threshold for direct 2s ionization at about
860 eV. The calculated product charge-state fractions
follow the experimental values reasonably well consid-
ering the simpliﬁcations that were applied in order to
keep the computations tractable. This is particularly
true for the lower product charge states q = 3 and 4.
The theoretical values for q = 5 agree with the corre-
sponding experimental quantities only for energies above
the threshold for direct 2p ionization at about 750 eV.
At lower energies the MCDF values for q = 5 are much
too small (they are essentially zero). The MCDF calcu-
lations signiﬁcantly underestimate the production of the
product charge state q = 6 over the entire experimental
energy range. The calculations do not predict any size-
able q = 7 fraction. We attribute this increasing failure
of our MCDF cascade model with increasing charge state
to a mismatch of the computed (auto-)ionization thresh-
olds and to the neglect of many-body processes in the
cascade calculations beyond the three-electron processes
mentioned in Section 3. At present, such detailed cal-
culations cannot be easily carried out for complex ions
such as Fe2+ within our MCDF framework, although
more advanced cascade computations, based on detailed
cascade trees, are under way (Fritzsche 2019).

Earlier work on cascades, after inner-shell ionization
of Fe2+, has been carried out by Kaastra & Mewe (1993)
and more recently by Kuˇcas et al. (2019, 2020). These
authors calculated the product charge-state distribu-
tions resulting from the removal of an inner-shell elec-
tron and the subsequent deexcitation cascades. In or-
der to compare these results with the measured prod-
uct charge-state fractions, the individual distributions
for each inner-shell hole have to be weighted by the
corresponding cross sections for inner-shell ionization
(Schippers et al. 2017; Beerwerth et al. 2019). To this
end, we used the subshell speciﬁc photoionization cross
sections of Verner et al. (1993) that are displayed in Fig-
ure 3. The resulting product charge-state fractions are
also displayed in Figure 5. The overall agreement of the
results of Kaastra & Mewe (1993) with the experimen-
tal ﬁndings is not as good as compared to our MCDF
calculations, in particular for the lowest two product-
ion charge states. For the higher product charge states
the agreement is somewhat better. Kuˇcas et al. (2019,
2020) have only considered the production of initial 2p
and 2s holes. Therefore, their values can only be ap-
plied at energies above the 2p ionization threshold and

are biased towards higher product charge states. They
signiﬁcantly underestimate the production of Fe6+. The
Kuˇcas et al. (2019, 2020) results for q = 4 and 5 are in
reasonable agreement with our MCDF and experimen-
tal results, given the various limitations of the theories.
The agreement with the Kaastra & Mewe (1993) results
is only reasonable for q = 5. Single ionization is severely
underestimated by Kuˇcas et al. (2019, 2020).

None of the above discussed cascade calculations re-
produces the experimental ﬁndings for the product
charge-state fractions fq in all the details. This is likely
due to the considerable complexity of the problem un-
der consideration which, currently, can only be treated
by making simplifying assumptions and by neglecting
higher order processes such as direct double ionization
which probably form a wide continuum of cross-section
contributions. Nevertheless, as shown in Figure 5, all
methods agree reasonably well with the experimental
ﬁndings (Tab. 1) for the photon-energy dependent mean
charge state ¯q (Equation 3).

4.2. Summary of the experimental and theoretical

absorption cross-sections for neutral and
low-charged iron

The present paper is the last in a sequence of pub-
lications on photoionization of low-charged iron ions.
Therefore, we can now provide a comparison with our
previous work on Fe+ (Schippers et al. 2017) and on
Fe3+ (Beerwerth et al. 2019) with a focus on the most
prominent features in the iron L-shell photoabsorption.
In particular, these features should be useful for the
identiﬁcation of gas-phase iron in the ISM. Figure 6 dis-
plays our experimental and theoretical results for Fe+,
Fe2+, and Fe3+ ions and also the corresponding re-
sults for neutral iron atoms of Richter et al. (2004). In
Figure 6, their Fe0 relative experimental cross sections
were multiplied by an energy-independent factor to scale
them to the theoretical cross-section scale. All the the-
oretical cross sections that are displayed in this ﬁgure
are HFR results (see Section 3) for statistical mixtures
of ground-conﬁguration levels as discussed in Section 4
for Fe2+. As already mentioned, the theoretical energy
scales were shifted by eye in order to best line up the the-
oretical resonance positions with the experimental ones.
The remaining minor discrepancies between theory and
experiment are most probably due to the inherent lim-
itations of the theoretical method and uncertainties in
the level populations for the experimental results. In the
following we thus use the experimentally benchmarked
theoretical cross sections for the comparison with ab-
sorption cross sections for solid materials that are ex-
pected to be present in interstellar dust particles.

levels and account for the experimental photon-energy band-
width which was ∼0.6 eV for Fe0 and ∼1 eV for Fe+, Fe2+,
and Fe3+. The one-sigma uncertainty of the experimental
photon-energy scale is ±0.2 eV for Fe+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ and
unspeciﬁed for Fe0.

5. COMPARISON WITH OTHER FORMS OF IRON

The nature of the chemical binding of iron to inter-
stellar dust particles is currently being debated. For ex-
ample, from experiments in microgravity Kimura et al.
(2017) concluded that the probability of the formation
of pure iron grains should be very low and that, con-
iron should be bound in iron compounds
sequently,
or accreted as impurities on other grains in the ISM.
Another hypothesis was pursued by Bilalbegovi´c et al.
(2016) who calculated infrared absorption spectra of hy-
drogenated iron particles. From a variety of astronomi-
cal observations and related astrophysical modeling, sev-
eral groups inferred that a large fraction of the iron
in the ISM could be incorporated as inclusions in sili-
cate grains (Zhukovska et al. 2018; Westphal et al. 2019;
Zafar et al. 2019). Using an ion implantation technique,
Leveneur et al. (2011) produced Fe nanoparticles in sil-
ica, which could serve as a proxy for iron locked in in-
terstellar dust particles. In addition, Lee et al. (2009)
have carefully measured absorption data for a number
of iron compounds.

Figure 7. Comparison of photoabsorption cross sections for
gas-phase neutral and low-charged ions with photoabsorp-
tion cross sections for solid iron and solid iron-bearing com-
pounds. The cross sections for Fe0, Fe+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ (col-
ored lines) are the experimentally benchmarked HFR results
for photoabsorption of the ground level only. The full and
the dashed colored lines were calculated taking into account
photon energy spreads of 0.24 eV and 1.0 eV, respectively.
The data for solid iron and iron-bearing compounds have
been taken from the work of Lee et al. (2009, black full lines)
and Leveneur et al. (2011, black dash-dotted line). The one-
sigma uncertainty of the experimental photon-energy scale
is ±0.2 eV for Fe+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ and unspeciﬁed for the
other samples (see text).

Figure 7 presents a comparison of the experimentally
benchmarked theoretical gas-phase data for neutral and
low-charged ions with the absorption cross sections for
solid iron and solid iron compounds of Lee et al. (2009)
and Leveneur et al. (2011). The theoretical gas-phase
data are diﬀerent from those displayed in Figure 6 where
statistical populations of several levels were considered
in order to account for the high temperatures in the
ion source. The temperatures in the ISM are consid-
erably lower such that usually only the ground levels
are signiﬁcantly populated. This is accounted for in
the theoretical data for Fe0, Fe+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ dis-
played in Figure 7. In addition, a ﬁnite photon energy
bandpass was considered by convoluting the theoretical

cross sections with Gaussians with FWHM of 1.0 eV
and 0.24 eV. The latter energy spread corresponds to a
resolving power E/∆E = 3000 as was used in the experi-
ments of Lee et al. (2009). This resolving power approx-
imately corresponds to what is currently foreseen for the
future Athena x-ray telescope (Barret et al. 2020).

When comparing x-ray absorption data from diﬀer-
ent sources, the calibration uncertainties of the diﬀer-
ent photon energy scales are an issue of concern. For
the Fe+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ absorption cross sections this
uncertainty is ±0.2 eV. In our experiments, absorption
features in gases were used as reference standards as
discussed in considerable detail by M¨uller et al. (2017,
2018). Neither Richter et al. (2004) nor Leveneur et al.
(2011) provide any information on the calibration un-
certainties of their energy scales. Lee et al. (2009) refer
their data to theoretically calculated values for the iron
2p absorption edges as provided by the computer code
of Brennan & Cowan (1992) which uses theoretical ab-
sorption data from Cromer & Liberman (1970, 1981).
This calibration is problematic for two reasons. First,
the experimental data do not exhibit a clear step-like
threshold absorption feature since this is masked by the
near-threshold photoabsorption resonances. Second, the
uncertainties of the theoretical calculations are unknown
and may be rather large. For example, in their compre-
hensive list of x-ray calibration features, Deslattes et al.
(2003) quote a diﬀerence between theoretical and ex-
perimental values for the iron L3 edge of 2 eV. This
value is in line with the −2.2 eV energy shift that we
applied in benchmarking the present theoretical HFR
results for photoabsorption of Fe2+. This uncertainty of
the solid-state data hampers a quantitative comparison
between gas-phase and solid-state absorption data. In
any case, the diﬀerences will become more apparent at
higher spectral resolving powers such as those envisaged
for future x-ray telescopes.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This publication concludes a sequence of papers
(Schippers et al. 2017; Beerwerth et al. 2019) on the
photoionization of low-charged Feq+ ions with q = 1,2,
and 3 that was designed to provide accurate data for
resonant L-shell photoabsorption in order to enable the
identiﬁcation of these ion species in the ISM medium
and their discrimination against solid-phase iron locked
up in dust grains. The experimental cross sections for
m-fold ionization (m=1–5) for Fe2+ were obtained by
using the photon-ion merged-beams technique at a syn-
chrotron light source. The cross-section data exhibit
strong absorption features associated with the excita-
tion of a 2p electron to higher atomic subshells. The

positions and relative peak intensities of these features
can serve as clear ﬁngerprints for the various iron charge
states investigated. We have also carried out quantum
theoretical calculations of photoabsorption by Fe2+ ions.
Furthermore, we have calculated the deexcitation cas-
cades that follow the creation of a 2p hole and that de-
termine the ﬁnal charge state distributions.

Using our combined experimental and theoretical re-
sults, we can generate the photoabsorption data needed
to model X-ray observations of the ISM. The exper-
imental results are particularly important for provid-
ing experimental benchmarks for the theoretical energy
scale. Because of the many-body nature of the prob-
lem, the calculated energies of the L-shell absorption
features have rather large uncertainties. Thus, our ex-
perimental benchmarking is vital for achieving the level
of accuracy required for astronomical observations. The
energy-shifted theoretical results can then be used to
generate the needed photoabsorption cross-section data
for cold ions, similar to those expected in the ISM. The
experimental results cannot be directly used due to the
initial level distribution of the ions corresponding to a
much higher temperature than the cold ISM. A direct
comparison of the present gas-phase absorption cross
section with absorption data for iron-bearing condensed
matter compounds from the literature is also hampered
by the unknown uncertainties of the photon-energies in
these studies. Future work on solid-state absorption
data is needed to address this issue.

Our calculations of the Auger cascades that evolve af-
ter the primary creation of a 2p hole by excitation or
direct ionization yield charge-state fractions that are in
reasonable agreement with the experimental ﬁndings for
the lowest two product-ion charge states, Fe3+ and Fe4+.
This is a clear improvement as compared to earlier work
by Kaastra & Mewe (1993) and by Kuˇcas et al. (2019,
2020). The higher product-ion charge states are not as
well described. This is attributed to the simpliﬁcations
that had to be made in order to keep the computations
tractable. For example, our calculations neglected dou-
ble shake processes that were found to be important
for an accurate description of cascades in a lighter ion
(Schippers et al. 2016b). A further development of the
atomic structure codes — such as currently pursued by
Fritzsche (2019) — is required to properly account for
the many-electron contributions and a suﬃciently large
set of decay paths also for heavier ions.
