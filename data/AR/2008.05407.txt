In this paper, we numerically study a Coulomb impurity problem for interacting Dirac fermions
restricted in disordered graphene quantum dots. In the presence of randomly distributed lattice
defects and spatial potential ﬂuctuations, the response of the critical coupling constant for atomic
collapse is mainly investigated by local density of states calculations within the extended mean-ﬁeld
Hubbard model. We ﬁnd that both types of disorder cause an ampliﬁcation of the critical threshold.
As a result, up to thirty-four percent increase in the critical coupling constant is reported. This
numerical result may explain why the Coulomb impurities remain subcritical in experiments, even if
they are supercritical in theory. Our results also point to the possibility that atomic collapse can be
observed in defect-rich samples such as Ar+ ion bombarded, He+ ion irradiated, and hydrogenated
graphene.

Quantum electrodynamics predicts that the 1S1/2 state
is only stable up to a critical nuclear charge Zc ∼ 172;
otherwise, formerly bound state becomes a resonant state
[1]. In spite of its long-standing history [2], collapse of
the vacuum is far from being proven in experiments per-
formed with real atoms [3]. However, graphene reduces
the critical threshold to Zc (cid:38) 1 through a larger ﬁne
structure constant α = 2.2/κ [4, 5], where κ is the dielec-
tric constant. Therefore, the idea of creating an artiﬁcial
supercritical atom with a smaller critical valence charge
has received considerable experimental attention [6–10].
In the condensed matter analogue, Dirac fermions form
the vacuum itself, and the Coulomb impurity acts as a
nucleus that couples to the vacuum by means of a di-
mensionless coupling strength β = Zα [11]. When β
exceeds a critical coupling constant βc, the lowest en-
ergy electron state ﬁrstly turns into a quasi-bound state
(QBS) [4], which corresponds to the 1S1/2 state of the
impurity, and an inﬁnite number of QBS can appear
for massless fermions, depending on the value of β [5].
The critical coupling constant is estimated to be βc =
0.5 for a vacuum consisting of non-interacting massless
Dirac fermions [4, 5], and it remains the same when these
fermions are conﬁned in smaller-sized graphene quantum
dots (GQDs) [12, 13]. A further extension of the problem
takes electron interactions into account [14, 15] for which
this critical value is renormalized to βc = 0.6 due to oﬀ-
site Coulomb repulsion among Dirac particles [13]. How-
ever, up until now, all theoretical calculations assume a
disorder-free graphene by ignoring the experimental facts
[16, 17], and the question of eﬀects of imperfections on
atomic collapse in graphene has not been addressed yet.

Atomic scale defects [18, 19] and the intercalation of
hydrogen atoms [20–22] may arise during the growth
process, and these defects lead to an imperfect honey-
comb lattice [23, 24]. Furthermore, such a deformed
vacuum can ﬂuctuate in response to spatial charge in-
homogeneities caused by substrate [25, 26]. To ﬁnd out
ambiguous consequences of these distortions beyond con-
ventional perspective of the theory, the hexagonal GQDs

with armchair edges [27] could provide a practical play-
ground. These GQDs serve as a bridge between the ﬁnite-
sized samples and bulk graphene thanks to their special
band-gap characteristics [27, 28], and a suﬃciently large
size of them is enough to observe atomic collapse, as evi-
denced by transmission coeﬃcients of the 1S1/2 state [13].
The latter could help in ﬁnding solutions to such complex
problems via exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian, even
in the case of interacting fermions.

In this letter, the critical threshold is studied by plac-
ing the Coulomb impurity at the center of disordered
hexagonal GQDs. Deviations from the perfection in
the vacuum are intentionally created by: (i) randomly
distributed point vacancies with diﬀerent concentrations
and (ii) electron-hole puddles induced by Gaussian impu-
rities. We ﬁnd a strong dependence of the critical thresh-
old on both types of disorder, leading to up to thirty-four
percent increase in the critical coupling constant.

FIG. 1: LDOS spectra at the impurity site
for : (a) the numbers of 2814, 5514, and 10
806 atoms, (b) spin-up QBS families, and
(c) spin-down QBS families in the presence

averaging over these samples.

It can be useful to discuss the eﬀect of the vacuum size
from a diﬀerent perspective before proceeding to the dis-
ordered cases. The pristine hexagonal GQDs that diﬀer
in size are created, and the discrete energy levels of them
are summed over at the impurity site r = 0.142 nm, as de-
scribed above. Although such a sum corresponding to a
family of QBS is not necessary for the perfect vacuums,
it will provide a considerable advantage in the follow-
ing sections. All supercritical states are sequentially ar-
ranged within this family, which contains the 1S1/2 state
as the ﬁrst component [5]. Atomic collapse occurs when
this sharp peak in the electronic LDOS crosses just below
the Dirac point (DP) [7], which will be the energy ori-
gin in our calculations due to the formation of spatially
extended resonances at the negative energies [12]. Mean-
while, the Fermi level (FL) moves down starting from the
energy origin as the coupling strength is increased within
the half-ﬁlled model [12, 13]. To avoid too cumbersome
notation, the critical coupling constant of the families of
QBS is represented by ˜βc, and only the response of the
spin-up Dirac fermions is studied for the perfect vacuums
due to the presence of a spin-independent central poten-
tial. The spin-up QBS families at the impurity site are
shown in Fig. 1(a) for the perfect GQDs consisting of
2814, 5514, and 10 806 carbon atoms. All families are
pinned just below the DP at ˜βc = 1.0, revealing that the
eﬀect of the Coulomb impurity is the same for all these
GQDs, and the critical bare valence charge is calculated
to be ˜Zc ≈ 2.73 by taking κ = 6.

When point defects are evenly distributed between the
sublattices, i.e., A (50%) and B (50%), the FL continues
to stay at the energy origin in the absence of the impurity
[35–37] as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(c). In fact, the FL
is the same for both the perfect and disordered cases that
validates the previous discussion on the DP and the FL in
our defect conﬁgurations when ˜β is turned on. As for the
spin symmetry, it is naturally broken in the disordered
lattices [31]. However, there is no diﬀerence between the
spin-up and spin-down families near ˜βc as shown in Fig.
1(b) and Fig. 1(c), respectively. As is clear from these
two ﬁgures, all QBS families at the impurity site retreat
from the DP depending on the concentration of these de-

i and j at relatively large distances, and it is in atomic
units. The last term represents the Coulomb impurity
placed at the origin of coordinate system, where ri is the
distance between the impurity and the site i. vF ≈ 1 ×
106 m/s is the Fermi velocity.

Atomic vacancies with concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5%,
1%, and 2%, which refers to the ratio of the number
of point vacancies Nvac to that of the lattice sites N,
are created by randomly and equally removing the two
sublattices, A (50%) and B (50%), of the bipartite lat-
tice [31]. For 1% concentration of carbon vacancies, the
electron-hole puddles are created by the superposition
of contributions of randomly distributed Gaussian impu-
rities [32] with a total number of Nimp = 16, i.e., the
impurity concentration nimp = 1.1 × 1013 cm−2. Gaus-
sian potential at a position rn can be written as follows:
Vi = (cid:80)Nimp
, where ∆ is the
impurity strength, and the impurity correlation length is
taken to be ξ = 10a (a = 0.142 nm is the C-C distance)
[33]. Half of these impurities are chosen as positive and
the other half as negative with the help of ∆, which ran-
domly ﬂuctuates within three diﬀerent intervals: (i) |∆|
< 0.1t, (ii) |∆| < 0.3t, and (iii) |∆| < 0.5t.

Local density of states (LDOS) [5] is experimentally ac-
cessible through a scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
[7] and is calculated by N (E, r) = (cid:80)
i |Ψi(r)|2δ(E − Ei),
where Ψ(r) is the normalized wave function, the energy
E is identical to applied bias voltage in STM measure-
ments, and Ei is the eigenenergy of the i th state. The
LDOS is the spatially resolved density of states (DOS),
which is calculated by summing the discrete energy levels
of the GQDs at a set of radial distances from the impu-
rity, ranging from r = 0.142 nm up to r = 1.136 nm. The
summations are performed by using a Gaussian member-
ship function with a standard deviation of σ = 0.2 eV in
a linearly spaced energy interval E ∈ [-2.5,2.5]. Since the
eﬀects of random disorders may diﬀer from atom to atom,
these calculations are separately carried out for each in-
dividual atom at the predeﬁned radial distances, and this
is repeated in ten random disorder distributions for each
of the above conﬁgurations [34]. Finally, the LDOS spec-
tra per lattice site at various distances are extracted by

of particular interest are these merging states below the
DP, and the total probability density of them is calcu-
|Ψ(r)|2(cid:3)
lated by p(r) = (1/2) (cid:2)(cid:80)
in which both spin components are included. For a rep-
resentative sample, p(r) is projected into the space at
diﬀerent coupling constants, ranging from ˜β = 0.5 up to
˜β = 0.8. Fig. 3(a)-(d) clearly show that whenever defect
states dive just below the DP, they are localized around
the missing atoms by preserving their characteristic tri-
angular shapes and then demonstrate a striking stability
against the Coulomb impurity. On the other hand, the
weight of probability density around the impurity pro-
gressively increases, but there is no formation of the ﬁrst
supercritical state at ˜β = 0.5 nor at ˜β = 0.6, which are
the critical coupling constants of the 1S1/2 state for the
non-interacting [5] and interacting [13] fermions in a clean
vacuum, respectively. Finally, the 1S1/2 state [39] comes
into appearance at ˜β = 0.8, despite not being a direct
contribution of the bulk states to p(r). Such a forma-
tion of the 1S1/2 state is presumably due only to the hy-
bridized components of the diving defect states, and the
defect-induced increases in Fig. 2(a)-(d) actually origi-
nate from the formation mechanism of the 1S1/2 state.

Prior to the collapse experiments [6–9], monolayer
graphene is grown by CVD and then is transferred onto
a hBN ﬂake placed on a SiO2/Si substrate. To model the
spatial potential ﬂuctuations caused by such a substrate,
we randomly distributed Gaussian impurities for the set
of vacuum disordered by 1% concentration of carbon va-

FIG. 3: Response of the empty defect states below the DP to
the Coulomb ﬁeld for a representative sample with 1% defect
density. Their spatial distributions are shown in (a)-(d) for ˜β
= 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively. Upward (downward) tri-
angular shapes belong to the unoccupied spin-up (spin-down)
vacancy-induced states. As is clear from (d), the 1S1/2 state
is formed at the center of QD marked by green dots.

stant ˜βc for the concentrations of 0.1% in (a), 0.5% in (b), 1%
in (c), and 2% in (d). Here spin-up and spin-down QBS fam-
ilies exactly overlap, and the diﬀerent colored lines represent
the corresponding radial distances from the impurity.

fects, which are randomly distributed in the GQD lattice
consisting of 5514 atoms in the pristine case. Fig. 1(b)
and Fig. 1(c) point out that ˜β = 1.0 is no longer a crit-
ical coupling constant, and it is the ﬁrst eﬀect of point
defects on atomic collapse.

These families transit from above to the edge of the
DP at diﬀerent ˜βc which is evident in Fig. 2(a)-(d). The
critical coupling constant gradually increases in propor-
tion to the defect densities and reaches ˜βc = 1.27 for
random dilution at 2% [see Fig. 2(d)]. Actually, these
defects are ubiquitous in the crystal structure [23]. For
example, the Raman spectrum has ∼ 0.5 G–to–2D inten-
sity ratio for the high-quality graphene monolayer grown
by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [38], and this ratio
indicates that there is a ﬁnite defect density in graphene.
As is clear from our numerical results, these structural
peculiarities can cause an increase in the critical thresh-
old. On the other hand, the spectral shapes of all QBS
families are the same as of the defect-free case, especially
in the vicinity of the impurity. It can be inferred that
atomic collapse can be similarly observed in the imper-
fect lattices with the help of a higher valance charge.

In the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model, the lowest energy
states in the conduction band are unoccupied vacancy-
induced states whose energies are between 0 eV<E<0.4
eV for 1% defect concentration [see the global DOS in
the inset of Fig. 1(c)]. As ˜β is increased, these states
successively dive into the negative energies. However,
there is no explicit crossing from the higher energy con-
duction states within the energy spectrums. Therefore,

cancies. The averaged potential landscapes of |∆| < 0.3t
and |∆| < 0.5t are shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(d),
respectively. The resulting electron-hole puddles of both
spin components show that the electron puddles (red) ap-
pear in the positive potential regions, whereas the hole
puddles (blue) manifest themselves in the negative po-
tential regions as can be seen in Fig. 4(b) for |∆| < 0.3t
and Fig. 4(e) for |∆| < 0.5t. As ˜β is turned on, the charge
inhomogeneities rearrange themselves under the eﬀect of
the Coulomb potential. For example, at ˜β = 1.2, the
electron-hole puddles of |∆| < 0.3t and those of |∆| <
0.5t are mapped in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 4(f), respectively.
Even if there is no signiﬁcant change in the positions of
the hole puddles formed at the distances away from the
center, those close to the center leave their positions and
are centered around the stronger Coulomb impurity. As
will be seen below, such a reformation has a signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the critical threshold.

LDOS spectra in Fig. 5(a)-(c) are calculated for the
spin-up QBS family at the corresponding radial dis-
tances, starting from the impurity site. When the pos-
itive and negative Gaussian impurities are distributed
evenly, the total DOS of the spin-up fermions at ˜β =
0 clearly reveal that the FL is again around the energy
origin for these conﬁgurations; see the inset in Fig. 5(c).
There is no signiﬁcant shift in the minimum energy point
at ˜β = 0, allowing us to take the energy origin as the DP
for the non-zero values of ˜β. Similar to the previous cases,
whenever the sharp peak enters the negative energy spec-
trum, then atomic collapse has occurred. The addition
of Gaussian impurities causes to an increase in the criti-
cal threshold from ˜βc = 1.20 [Fig. 2(c)] up to ˜βc = 1.34
[Fig. 5(c)], and the critical valance charge is estimated
to be as high as ˜Zc = 3.65. In addition, we also study
the point defect-free GQD consisting of 5514 atoms for
ten random distributions of |∆| < 0.5t, and the critical
threshold reaches to ˜βc = 1.10 (not shown here), which is

FIG. 4: Upper panel: (a) averaged potential ﬂuctuations for
|∆| < 0.3t (only |∆|’s averaged), (b) the total electron-hole
puddles accordingly are formed at ˜β = 0, and (c) the refor-
mation of these charge puddles at ˜β = 1.2. Lower panel: the
same as the upper panel but now for |∆| < 0.5t.

˜βc = 1.0 [Fig. 1(a)] in its clean case. It can be noted that
the increments in the critical threshold are independent
of the sign of the substrate-induced potential where the
Coulomb impurity is placed and are directly proportional
to the strengths of Gaussian impurities. As a result, ˜βc
seems to be highly inﬂuenced by the disorders within the
vacuum itself.

FIG. 5: The eﬀect of electron-hole puddles on the critical
threshold in (a)-(c), which are the same for both spin com-
ponents. The inset in (c) shows averaged total DOS at ˜β =
0, where black, red, blue, and purple lines represent ∆ = 0,
|∆| < 0.1t, |∆| < 0.3t, and |∆| < 0.5t, respectively. For the
sake of simplicity, a space between these lines is intentionally
added.

In bulk graphene, a series of LDOS measurements per-
formed by a STM reveals that a cluster, composed of four
calcium dimers in the charge state of +1|e|, is needed
to form an inﬁnite family of QBS at just above the DP
[7]]. Therefore, the critical bare
[see Fig. 1(D) in Ref.
valance charge should be slightly greater than ˜Zc (cid:38) 4 in
the experiment. Accordingly, the calculated values of ˜Zc
are approaching to that of the experiment, and adding
these experimentally relevant factors to the Coulomb im-
purity problem opens a new route towards such experi-
mental results [6, 7]. These ﬁndings can be useful in in-
terpreting the experimental results of positively charged
Coulomb impurities, even if they exceed the theoretical
critical value. Results of this paper can be tested via Ar+
ion bombarded [40], He+ ion irradiated [41], and hydro-
genated [42] graphene. The latter can be achieved by
transferring CVD graphene samples at diﬀerent H cov-
erages [42] onto a hBN/SiO2/Si device, which facilities
to control bias and back-gate voltages. Impurities such
as cobalt trimmers [6] and calcium dimers [7, 9] can be
gathered in a defect-rich region by atomic manipulation
of them with the help of STM, and an artiﬁcial super-
critical atom can be created from these subcritical impu-
rities. Once the DP has been determined, LDOS spectra
can be measured at diﬀerent radial or lateral distances.
There should be an increase in the critical threshold due
to the partial removal of the πz states depending on the
concentration of H.
