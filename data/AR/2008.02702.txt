ABSTRACT

How much energy do solar active regions (ARs) typically radiate during quiescent periods? This is
a fundamental question for storage and release models of ﬂares and ARs, yet it is presently poorly
answered by observations. Here we use the “Sun-as-a-point-source spectra from the EUV Variability
Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to provide a novel estimate of radiative
energy losses of an evolving active region. Although EVE provides excellent spectral (5 − 105 nm)
and temperature (2 − 25 MK) coverage for AR analysis, to our knowledge, these data have not been
used for this purpose due to the lack of spatial resolution and the likelihood of source confusion. Here
we present a way around this problem. We analyze EVE data time series, when only one large AR
11520 was present on the disk. By subtracting the quiet Sun background, we estimate the radiative
contribution in EUV from the AR alone. We estimate the mean AR irradiance and cumulative AR
radiative energy losses in the 1−300 ˚A and astronomical standard ROSAT-PSPC, 3−124 ˚A, passbands
and compare these to the magnetic energy injection rate through the photosphere, and to variations of
the solar cycle luminosity. We ﬁnd that while AR radiative energy losses are 100 times smaller than
typical magnetic energy injection rates at the photosphere, they are an order of magnitude larger or
similar to the bolometric radiated energies associated with large ﬂares. This study is the ﬁrst detailed
analysis of AR thermal properties using EVE Sun-as-a-star observations, opening doors to AR studies
on other stars.

1. INTRODUCTION

The evolution of an active region (AR) in the solar
corona reﬂects the evolution of the photospheric mag-
netic ﬁelds connected to it (see the review by van Driel-
Gesztelyi & Green 2015). Many multi-wavelength anal-
yses have studied the long-term evolution of ARs, in-
cluding the behavior of the magnetic ﬁeld and its non-
potentiality (e.g. D´emoulin et al. 2002), ﬂare and CME
activity (e.g. Iglesias et al. 2019), helicity budget (e.g.
Liu & Schuck 2012), coronal heating (e.g. Warren et al.
2012; Reva et al. 2018), coronal intensity, temperature
and emission measure (e.g. Fisher et al. 1998; Tripathi
et al. 2011; Ugarte-Urra et al. 2017), total irradiance
(e.g. Ortiz et al. 2004; Zahid et al. 2004).

While many aspects of long-term active region evolu-
tion have been well studied (van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green
2015), we are still missing quantitative observational es-

timates of how much energy ARs lose to radiation as
they evolve. Speciﬁcally, how much of the magnetic en-
ergy injected as Poynting ﬂux through the photosphere
is lost due to radiation? This estimate is essential to
constrain the total energy budget of the AR. In principle
the Poynting ﬂux should match the budget of magnetic
energy stored in the AR and its radiative (and other)
In practice, however, most of the cur-
energy losses.
rent approaches estimate AR total magnetic energy as
a cumulative sum of the photospheric Poynting ﬂuxes
(Kazachenko et al. 2015; Liu & Schuck 2012; Lumme
et al. 2019; Tziotziou et al. 2013; Vemareddy 2015), ne-
glecting radiative energy losses.

Deriving radiative energy losses from the observa-
tions requires broad spectral measurements covering a
range of characteristic temperatures. Here the Ex-
treme Ultraviolet Variability (EUV) Experiment (EVE;
Woods et al. 2012) on-board Solar Dynamics Observa-
tory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) has ideal properties spec-
troscopically. It acquires continuous full-disk EUV spec-

tra of Sun-as-a-star in the range of 5 to 105 nm every 10
seconds with spectral resolution of 0.1 nm and an excel-
lent signal-to-noise ratio. The MEGS-A component of
EVE in particular contains a wide variety of iron emis-
sion lines formed around 105.7 − 106.8 K (0.5 − 6.3 MK),
making it an excellent basis for studying solar tempera-
ture proﬁles during both active and quiescent periods.

Although EVE provides full spectral coverage for AR
analysis, to our knowledge, no EVE data have been
used explicitly for AR analysis. The main reason for
this is lack of spatial resolution in EVE observations –
since EVE observes the Sun-as-a-star spectrum, it can-
not simply distinguish between AR and quiet-Sun con-
tributions. However, when only one AR is present on the
disk we can subtract the Sun-as-a-star spectrum when
no ARs are present (the quiet-Sun spectrum), to de-
rive the spectrum of AR alone. In this paper, we use
such EVE diﬀerence spectra to ﬁrst ﬁnd the diﬀerential
emission measure (DEM) of the AR and then use it to
quantify AR radiative energy losses as a function of time
in the 1 − 300 ˚A spectral range.

The Sun-as-a-star approach here explicitly relates to
the solar irradiance at one AU, equivalent to an as-
tronomical “spectral energy distribution” or SED. The
standard solar reference work for active-region luminos-
ity remains the classical review of Withbroe & Noyes
(1977), which focused on assessing the luminosity as
a surface brightness, as related to classical 1D semi-
empirical model atmospheres. Our approach here re-
sults in the estimates of the luminosity, LAR, of an ac-
tive region during its disk passage, which we compare
with the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux of the region (cf.
Fisher et al. 1998) and the magnetic energy ﬂux through
the photosphere, the Poynting ﬂux.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we de-
scribe the EVE data during a passage of AR 11520 and
the analysis we used to ﬁnd ﬂuxes in lines of interest. In
Section 3, we describe the methods we use to ﬁnd AR
Diﬀerential Emission Measures (DEMs) and AR radia-
tive losses. In Section 4 we present DEMs from EVE and
compare them with DEMs derived from the averaged in-
tensities from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA;
Lemen et al. 2012) data; we show how the region’s DEM
evolves as a function of time, derive its radiative losses
and total radiated energy and compare our results with
previous scaling relationship between AR X-ray emis-
sion and magnetic ﬂux (Fisher et al. 1998). Finally, in
Section 5, we summarize our results and draw conclu-
sions, including comparisons with the classical reference
of Withbroe & Noyes (1977).

2. DATA: EVE OBSERVATIONS OF AR 11520

contribution function (Tmax) and the maximum value of the

disk from its central meridian crossing (∼11 July 2012)
to its disappearance over the East limb, allowing us to
attribute the disk-integrated properties to this region
over this interval. Speciﬁcally, AR 11520 appeared on
the East limb on tEast = 05-Jul-2012 (S15E70), crossed
the central meridian on tCM = 12-Jul-2012 (S16W08)
and disappeared behind the West limb on tWest = 18-
Jul-2012 (S17W89). The Sun did not have any large
ARs on July 21 2012, hence we chose tQS = 20-Jul-
2012 05:00 UT as the quiet-Sun reference time. We chose
tAR = 10-Jul-2012 11:00 UT as the primary sample time,
when the AR was 15◦ East from the central meridian;
tAR corresponded to a quiescent period of AR evolution
one hour after a C2.0-class ﬂare. As AR 11520 crossed
the disk, it hosted one X1.4 ﬂare on 12 July 2012, four
M-class ﬂares (M1.1, M2.0, M1.7, M1.0) and 37 C-class

Figure 1 illustrates the temporal evolution of image-
resolved magnetic ﬁeld and EUV 211 ˚A irradiance: the
left and middle columns show line-of-sight (LOS) mag-
netic ﬁeld maps from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI, Schou et al. 2012) and 211 ˚A images from AIA
at tAR and tQS, respectively. The right column shows
the evolution of disk-integrated LOS magnetic ﬂux,
ΦLOS(t), and the 211 ˚A irradiance, Φ(211˚A, t), over the
17-day interval, with red and blue vertical lines marking
tAR and tQS, respectively. For consistent comparison
with irradiances, we did not account for magnetic ﬁeld
inclination nor foreshortening in ΦLOS(t) calculation.
We also ignored small contributions into ΦLOS(t) and
EVE irradiances from minor regions after tAR, assuming
that these originate from AR 11520. At the beginning
of AR disk passage (before tAR), other preceding regions
dominate. The smooth variation of the LOS magnetic
ﬂux around the central meridian passage shows the dom-
inance of this region and is consistent with the expected
nearly-vertical ﬁeld orientation. Taking the diﬀerence of
magnetic ﬂuxes at the AR and QS times, we evaluate

the target region’s LOS unsigned magnetic ﬂux at tAR,
ΦLOS,AR(tAR) = ΦLOS(tAR)−ΦLOS(tQS) = 8×1022 Mx.
Alternatively, using a Mercator-deprojected HMI vector
magnetic ﬁeld map that includes the AR alone, we ﬁnd
a more accurate vertical (radial) unsigned magnetic ﬂux
Φr,AR = 11.8 × 1022 Mx. Comparing this estimate with
magnetic ﬂux distributions from other known regions
(see Figure 8, Kazachenko et al. 2017), we characterize
AR 11520 as a large region, with ΦAR exceeding that
of 80% of all solar active regions (for comparison the
well-studied region AR 11158 had about 1/3 as much
unsigned magnetic ﬂux, 4 × 1022 Mx).

To track the region’s evolution across the EUV spec-
trum, we used EVE spectral irradiances, I(λ, t), from
tstart = 03-Jul-12 09:00 UT to tend = 20-Jul-12 00:00 UT.
We chose an hourly cadence and derived 429 spectra
ranging from 6.5 to 37 nm. When an active region passes
across the solar disk, an enhancement is observed across
the EUV spectrum. We used this enhancement to de-
rive the diﬀerence spectrum, comparing tAR to tQS and
thus isolating the target region alone; we can thus study
its properties independent of the quiet-Sun background.

Dotted lines show spectral lines selected for the DEM analysis. See the line list in Table 1 and more details in §2.

This approach is not perfect because the presence of the
region may itself alter the background spectrum; for this
reason we have restricted our analysis to optically thin
lines where this problem may not be signiﬁcant.

Figure 2 shows the EVE spectrum (spectral irradi-
ance) at tAR and tQS, namely I(λ, tAR) and I(λ, tQS)
(top), and the diﬀerence spectrum due in principle to
AR 11520 contribution alone at tAR, I(λ, tAR)−I(λ, tQS)
(bottom). The dotted lines correspond to 24 selected
spectral lines, {λi}, that we chose to describe the EUV
spectrum (see Table 1 for a line list).

To quantify the total ﬂux in each line, taking into
account possible line shifts and background oﬀsets, we
ﬁtted the curve of each line with a Gaussian function.
Figure 3 shows an example of Gaussian ﬁts for 24 EVE
spectral lines at tAR and tQS, respectively. We then
integrated the spectral irradiance below each Gaussian
around the line center to estimate the net irradiance

corresponding to each spectral line at time t:

= Φ(λi, t) − Φ(λi, tQS).

Figure 4 shows the result of this ﬁtting: evolution of
irradiances, ∆Φ(λi, t), in 24 EVE lines corresponding to
AR 11520 as it crossed the disk. Note, how 171.1 ˚A line
irradiance dropped below zero as AR 11520 crossed the
disk (Panel 2, following the red line). These negative
values are caused by “dark canopies” or “circumfacular
regions” around the AR, which are darker that the quiet
Sun in 171.1 ˚A line. Originally discovered by Hale &
Ellerman (1903) as a chromospheric eﬀect, they also ap-
pear clearly in the nominally coronal 171 ˚A band (Wang
et al. 2011), but without a detailed physical explanation
yet. Since negative irradiances complicate the analysis,
we exclude the 171.1 ˚A line from our further EVE data
analysis, resulting in a ﬁnal list of 23 EVE and 5 AIA
lines (Hale & Ellerman 1903).

3. METHODS: FINDING THE DEM AND

RADIATED ENERGY USING EVE DATA

The ﬂux diﬀerences we derive from EVE for each line,
∆Φ(λi, t), are related to emissions as expressed in terms
of the contribution function G(λi, Te, Ne), and the dif-

ferential emission measure, DEM (Te, t), by

where Te and Ne are the electron temperature and num-
ber density and G(λi, Te, Ne) is computed with the CHI-
ANTI V.8 atomic database. To ﬁnd G(λi, Te, Ne) we

6

Kazachenko et al.

summed up contributions from each CHIANTI emis-
sion line within the ±1˚A centered on the wavelength
of each individual EVE line, assuming coronal abun-
dances (Feldman 1992) and Mazzotta et al. (1998) ion-
ization equilibria. Since EVE measures the irradiance
in W m−2nm−1 and G(T ) has units of erg cm−3 s−1, to
compare between the two we need to take into account
the solid angle of the taken solar emission. Therefore
in Eq. 2 we divide the EVE irradiances, Φ(λi, t), by the
approximate solid angle occupied by the area of the AR:
AAR/R2 = 0.1Adisk/R2 = 0.1 × 6.807 × 10−5 sr, where
Adisk is the solar disk area in cm2, R is the Earth-Sun
distance and 0.1 approximates the upper limit of the
fraction of the solar disk occupied by the AR (see, e.g.,
Schonfeld et al. 2017). In Eq. 2, DEM (Te, t) (in units
of cm−3K−1), describes the temperature distribution of
plasma emitted along a distance along the LOS, s, at
temperature Te at time t,

DEM (Te, t) = N 2

e ds/dTe.

(3)

In this paper we use EVE irradiances, ∆Φ(λi, t), to
solve Eq. 2 and derive DEM (Te, t). Previously, many
diﬀerent DEM inversion methods have been developed
and used to solve Eq. 2 for DEM in ﬂares and ARs
using AIA/SDO (e.g. Cheung et al. 2015; Plowman
et al. 2013; Hannah & Kontar 2012; Warren et al. 2012),
EIS/Hinode (e.g. Tripathi et al. 2011; Warren et al.
2012; Testa et al. 2011; Petralia et al. 2014), Coronas-F
(Reva et al. 2018), EVE/SDO (Schonfeld et al. 2017)
and EVE/SDO and RHESSI (Caspi et al. 2014; Mc-
Tiernan et al. 2019) datasets.
In this paper we use
the Hannah & Kontar (2012) inversion method with the
EVE irradiances, ∆Φ(λi, t), in either the full 23-line set
or on a subset of 5 lines as identiﬁed in Table 1, and
the G(λi, Te, Ne) functions from CHIANTI, to ﬁnd the
DEM (Te, t) (Eq. 2). It is common to enforce positivity
in the DEM solutions to prevent apparently nonphysi-
cal negative emission measures, but this may be math-
ematically incorrect for a diﬀerence spectrum in which
negative values may occur naturally. For DEM inver-
sions using the reduced set of 5 lines we ﬁnd that the
solutions obtained are uniformly positive even without
this constraint, which is not the case when we use the
full 23-line set in Table 1.

Finally, at each time ti, we integrate over all coronal
emission lines and DEM(Te, t) to ﬁnd the energy radi-
ated by the AR plasma, the AR luminosity,

(cid:90)

LAR(t) =

Gtot(Te, Ne)DEM (Te, t)dTe.

In this approach, to account for all coronal emission
lines in 1 − 300 ˚A range we sum CHIANTI contribu-
tion functions, Gtot(Te, Ne) = (cid:80)
i G(λi, Te, Ne)dλ using
ionization equi-
coronal abundances (Feldman 1992),

libria (Mazzotta et al. 1998), and a constant pressure
(1015 cm−3 K) within a temperature range of Log10T =
[5.4, 7.5]. Finally, integrating AR luminosity over time,
we ﬁnd the total AR radiative losses during 10 days of
AR evolution from tAR to tQS.

4. RESULTS

4.1. Active-Region DEM: EVE vs. AIA observations

To test our approach of using EVE measurements to
ﬁnd the DEM, we ﬁrst calculate a DEM from the EVE
diﬀerence spectrum and compare it with one derived
from the full-disk AIA images (Figure 5). To make a
direct comparison we ﬁrst derive the DEM from EVE
data using the reduced set of 5 spectral lines: 131.2,
195.1 ˚A, 211.3 ˚A, 335.5 ˚A, and 93.9 ˚A. We exclude the
171.1 ˚A line from our analysis since its diﬀerence irra-
diance, ∆Φ(λi, tAR), dropped below zero as AR 11520
crossed the disk (see Figure 4, Panel 2 for 171.1 ˚A). For
AIA intensities we use full-disk averaged intensity diﬀer-
ences, ¯IAIA,λ(tAR) − ¯IAIA,λ(tQS). For AIA emissivities
we use the AIA response function (Boerner et al. 2012).
To ﬁnd the DEM we choose a range of temperatures,
Log10T = [5.4, 7.5], binned into 53 segments.

two DEMs,
DEM (Te, tAR), derived from diﬀerence ﬂuxes from
EVE (5 lines) and AIA (6 bands), ∆Φ(λi, tAR) (see
Eq. 1), respectively. The middle panel shows EVE
contribution functions corresponding to each line.
Notice that even though many lines can be considered
isothermal, they have signiﬁcant emission over a range
of temperatures due to contributions from other lines
within ±1˚A centered on each individual EVE line
(see G(λ, Te, Ne) description in §3). The right panel
shows the comparison between observed and DEM-
reconstructed EVE ﬂuxes, as a validation test for the
DEM inversion. From this comparison, we conclude
that the EVE and AIA datasets result in similar DEM
estimates, validating our working hypothesis of using
EVE Sun-as-a-star measurements to derive thermal
properties of an evolving AR in the absence of other
solar activity on the disk. The coarse wavelength set
for EVE resulted in a minor discrepancy at the lowest
temperatures.

In Figure 6 we also calculate the ARs DEM when it
is at the disk center using all 23 EVE lines instead of
the 5-line subset as above. We compare DEMs from 23
EVE lines with DEM derived using 6 bands from AIA
and also ﬁnd that the two agree well, but note that the
errors for the 23-line inversion are larger (compare e.g.
the 131 ˚A and 94 ˚A lines validation on the right panels of
Figures 5 and 6). These larger errors might lead to non-

realistic DEM inversions (see e.g. a small DEM increase
around Log10T = 7 in the 23-line inversion). Moreover
the selection of suitable lines for DEM analysis is critical
since the detailed atomic characteristics associated with
the chosen emission lines must be fully characterized
to properly calculate the DEM. Since CHIANTI lacks a
large number of weak unresolved lines that appear in the
EVE spectrum, we further restrict our analysis of DEM
evolution to only 5 emission lines, shown in Figure 5,
that are best characterized.

4.2. Active Region Irradiance Evolution

Figure 7 (left panel) shows the evolution of the de-
rived AR DEM (Te, t) from July 10 to July 20 2012. The
panels on the right show the quality of the DEM recon-
struction: a comparison between EVE input diﬀerence
ﬂuxes and the ﬂuxes reconstructed from the DEM. The
validation time series match each other closely, includ-
ing the hot enhancements during ﬂares, with Spearman
correlation coeﬃcient ranging from 0.96 to 1.0 for the
5 selected lines. We ﬁnd the worst diﬀerences (up to
20% for 211 ˚A and 30% for 335 ˚A lines), correspond-
ing to Log10(Tmax) = [6.3, 6.4]. These discrepancies

serve as uncertainty estimates, complementing contribu-
tions from the calibration of the EVE irradiance spec-
tra (5 − 7%, for the strongest lines, Hock et al. 2012),
error estimation of line ﬂuxes from our Gaussian ﬁts
to the EVE spectra (several percent depending on the
line), any density sensitivity in the DEM estimates, plus
the acknowledged uncertainties in the CHIANTI atomic
data. We estimate an overall uncertainty in the DEMs
to be less than 40%, exclusive of the possibly comparable
uncertainties in the atomic data (Dere et al. 1997).

In Figure 8 we show how the EUV irradiance and
luminosity evolve during the 10 days of AR evolu-
tion, IAR(t) and LAR(t). To estimate LAR(t) (top
right panel), we use Eq. 4, using the EVE-derived
DEM (Te, t) (see Figure 7) and the total contribu-
tion function, Gtot(Te, Ne) = (cid:80)
i G(λi, Te, Ne)dλ, us-
ing CHIANTI data in the 1 − 300 ˚A range (top left
panel). We ﬁnd the mean AR 11520 irradiance to be
¯IAR = 2.3 × 105 ergs/(cm2 s), and the luminosity to be
¯LAR = 3.5 × 1026 ergs/s = 1026.5 ergs/s (see horizontal
dotted lines on the top right and bottom left panels, re-
spectively). Integrating LAR over 10 days, we ﬁnd the

converted to the “RASS” [0.1 − 2.4] keV ([5.2 − 123] ˚A)
ROSAT/PSPC passband to ﬁnd similar estimates; these
were later adjusted by Haisch & Schmitt (1996) to
increase the minimum value to 1026 ergs/s. Ayres
(1997) used suborbital rocket measurements in a nar-
[6 − 62] ˚A (0.2 − 2 keV), to obtain
rower passband,
higher variations from 5 × 1026 to 2 × 1027 ergs/s. Fi-
nally, Judge et al. (2003) also used SNOE-SXP mea-
surements in the RASS passband to estimate variations
from 6.3 × 1026 to 7.9 × 1027 ergs/s. To relate our es-
timates of AR luminosity with stellar and solar cycle
variations, we also evaluate radiative loss rates over the
RASS passband. We ﬁnd the mean AR 11520 luminos-
ity, ¯LAR,(3−124) = 1.4 × 1026 ergs/s, which is some 5
times smaller than the minimum range of the solar cy-
cle variation, 6.3 × 1026 ergs/s, reported by Judge et al.
(2003), and therefore roughly in concordance given the
common occurrence of multiple active regions during so-
lar maximum.

In addition, we compare our region’s luminosity to
the magnetic energy ﬂux through the photosphere, the
Poynting ﬂux Sz, one hour before tAR. Figure 9 shows
the spatial distribution of Sz in AR 11520. To cal-
culate Sz = −Eh × Bh we use the horizontal compo-
nent of the electric ﬁeld vector, Eh, from the PDFI
inversion method (Kazachenko et al. 2014, 2015), and
the horizontal component of the vector magnetic ﬁeld
Bh, on July 10 09:48 UT. We ﬁnd that the major-
ity of the AR magnetic energy at the photosphere
is injected at positive and negative vertical Poynt-
ing ﬂuxes, Sz ≈ [107, 108] ergs/(cm2 s), with a to-
tal AR-integrated energy injection rate, Emag(tAR) =
(cid:82)
AR SzdS = 3 × 1028
ergs/s. Note, that here we
only estimate the energy injection rate Emag at one
time, when the AR was close to the disk center. How-

ever, as we have seen from a study of magnetic en-
ergy ﬂuxes in AR 11158, Emag(t) varies signiﬁcantly
as a function of time. For AR 11158 we found a
mean ¯Emag = 5 × 1027 ergs/s during 5 days of this
region’s evolution, varying from −6 to 18×1027 ergs/s
(see Fig. 9 in Kazachenko et al. 2015).
If we as-
sume, that our instantaneous estimates of Emag(tAR)
and Sz(tAR) approximate mean magnetic energy injec-
tion rate at the photosphere, as AR 11520 evolved,
then we conclude that both typical Poynting ﬂuxes,
Sz(tAR) ≈ [107, 108] ergs/(cm2 s), and the mean mag-
netic energy injection rate, Emag(tAR) = 3×1028 ergs/s,
are around two orders of magnitude larger than the
mean AR irradiance, ¯IAR = 2.3 × 105 ergs/(cm2 s), and
the AR luminosity, ¯LAR = 3.5 × 1026 ergs/s, derived
above.

Finally, we compare our mean AR luminosity to AR
unsigned magnetic ﬂux, ¯LAR and ΦLOS,AR. Previously,
Fisher et al. (1998) used Mees Solar Observatory (MSO)
vector magnetic ﬁeld and Yohkoh SXT X-ray obser-
vations in 333 ARs between 1991 and 1995 to ﬁnd a
relationship between magnetic ﬁelds and coronal heat-
ing. They deduced a scaling law between AR lumi-
nosities (in 1 − 300 ˚A) and unsigned magnetic ﬂuxes,
LAR ≈ 1.2 × 1026 erg/s (ΦAR/1022Mx )1.19. Note that
Fisher et al. (1998) used a simpliﬁed single-temperature
approach (Log10T = 6.5 or T = 3 × 106 K) resulting
in errors in LAR up to a factor of 2. Here, in con-
trast, we use a more accurate multi-temperature DEM
approach to estimate the AR luminosity. We compare
our estimates of mean AR luminosity and magnetic ﬂux

as AR crossed the disk, ¯LAR = 3.5 × 1026 erg/s and
ΦLOS,AR = 8 × 1022 Mx. We ﬁnd that our ¯LAR is 4
times smaller than the one expected for a given ΦLOS,AR
from the scaling law above, but is in agreement with
the overall scatter of (LAR − ΦAR) shown in Figure 9
of Fisher et al. (1998). Note that here we only com-
pared mean values of (LAR − ΦAR), instead of their evo-
lution, since neither of these variables exhibited much
variability apart from variations due to solar rotation.
We would also like to note that our AR magnetic ﬂux is
above the range of AR magnetic ﬂuxes in Fisher et al.
(1998). Comparing unsigned magnetic ﬂuxes in Fisher
et al. (1998) from MSO and Kazachenko et al. (2017)
from SDO, we ﬁnd that the SDO values are around 5-
times larger than the MSO values, a discrepancy that
might be interesting to explore in future.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We have evaluated the radiative losses during a qui-
escent period of the evolution of AR 11520. For this we
used hourly Sun-as-a-star spectra from EVE/SDO in the
6.5 nm to 37 nm range during 10 days, as this fairly large
AR 11520 (ΦLOS,AR = 8 × 1022 Mx) was crossing the so-
lar disk. Since AR 11520 was the only major region
on the solar disk, we could use EVE diﬀerence ﬂuxes,
∆Φ(λi, t) = Φ(λi, t) − Φ(λi, tQS), to derive its DEM.
Speciﬁcally, we used a set of 5 iron emission lines that
sample the AR coronal temperature range from 0.5 MK
to 6.3 MK (Log10T = [5.7, 6.8]) and have well-studied
atomic properties and minimal blending. We then ap-
plied this approach to a sequence of EVE spectra to

10

Kazachenko et al.

derive a sequence of DEMs during 10 days of AR evolu-
tion (see Figure 7). From the derived evolution of DEM
we determined the AR radiative losses as a function of
time (see Figure 8). Our ﬁndings are as follows.

1. We ﬁnd that the shape and the peak tempera-
ture of the DEM, as extracted from EVE data,
are overall consistent with previous studies using
spatially-resolved studies of quiescent regions (e.g.
Warren et al. 2012; Petralia et al. 2014; Tripathi
et al. 2011). Our DEM peaks at Log10T = 6.3,
corresponding to a relatively cool AR plasma. The
peak temperature stays nearly constant as the
AR evolves, illustrating the slowly varying nature
of irradiance of the region studied. The DEM
does exhibit high-temperature enhancements dur-
ing ﬂares. Our 1-hour cadence of EVE data is too
sparse for describing ﬂare contributions, and we
have ignored them in this analysis.

2. We ﬁnd the mean AR irradiance during 10 days
of AR evolution in the 1 − 300 ˚A spectral range,
¯IAR = 2.3 × 105 ergs/(cm2s). This estimate is
around 20 times smaller than the classical With-
broe & Noyes (1977) estimate of the bolomet-
ric radiative ﬂux in such a region, IAR,W&N =
5 × 106 erg/(cm2s). Note, however, that our esti-
mate does not include the optically thick compo-
nent (essentially, the chromosphere), which With-
broe & Noyes (1977) estimate at about twice the
magnitude of the optically thin coronal compo-
nent. The remainder of the discrepancy presum-
ably relates to the scaling of AR area.

3. Integrating over the whole AR, we ﬁnd a mean
AR radiative energy loss rate during 10 days of
AR evolution, ¯LAR = 3.5 × 1026 erg/s. We com-
pare it with the magnetic energy ﬂux through the
photosphere, when the AR is close to the disk cen-
ter, Sz,mag = [107, 108] erg/(cm2s), or integrating
over the whole active region, a total energy ﬂux
of Emag = 3 × 1028 erg/s. We conclude that the
coronal radiative energy losses within 1 − 300 ˚A
comprise about 1% of the available magnetic en-
ergy ﬂux, conﬁrming the relative importance of
the chromospheric heating problem.

4. To relate our estimates of AR luminosity with stel-
lar and solar cycle variations, we evaluate radia-
tive loss rates over the 3 − 124 ˚A ROSAT-PSPC
passband. We ﬁnd a mean AR 11520 luminosity,
¯LAR,(3−124) = 1.4 × 1026 erg/s, which is 5 times
smaller than the minimum range of the solar cycle

variation, 6.3×1026 erg/s, reported by Judge et al.
(2003).

5. We ﬁnd AR 11520 total cumulative radiated en-
ergy, Erad = 2.5 × 1032 ergs, during 10 days of
evolution. This estimate is an order of magnitude
larger or similar to bolometric radiated energies
associated with M- and X-class ﬂares (Emslie et al.
2012, Ebol ≈ 1030 − 1031 ergs), highlighting im-
portance of AR radiative losses in AR and ﬂare
energetics.

6. Finally, we compare our mean AR luminosity to
AR unsigned magnetic ﬂux. We ﬁnd these to be
consistent with a previously derived statistical re-
lationship, LAR ∼ Φ1.19
AR , using a more simpliﬁed
single-temperature approach (Fisher et al. 1998).
We therefore conﬁrm that this relationship could
be further used in both solar and stellar astron-
omy, when only one kind of observation is avail-
able.

7. This study is the ﬁrst detailed analysis of AR ther-
mal properties using EVE/SDO Sun-as-a-star ob-
servations. Our novel approach opens doors to
similar studies of active regions on other stars
where spatial resolution is an issue (e.g. France
et al. 2019).

To conclude, our analysis demonstrates that AR co-
ronal radiative losses are ∼ 100 times smaller than the
typical magnetic energy ﬂuxes at the photosphere, but
nevertheless are signiﬁcant compared to ﬂare radiative
losses. Although this study did not include chromo-
spheric losses, Withbroe & Noyes (1977) estimate these
at about twice the coronal contribution, and the major-
ity of the magnetic energy supply may therefore wind
up in faculae. Future synergetic studies of energy cy-
cle in active regions, including magnetic energy ﬂuxes
through the photosphere and coronal energy losses dur-
ing both quiescent and active periods of AR evolution
(e.g. Iglesias et al. 2019) will enable our understanding
of active-region energetics that may be overlooked in
isolated studies of ﬂaring or quiescent periods of ARs.
