Abstract Detectors using liquid xenon as target are widely
deployed in rare event searches. Conclusions on the interact-
ing particle rely on a precise reconstruction of the deposited
energy which requires calibrations of the energy scale of the
detector by means of radioactive sources. However, a micro-
scopic calibration, i.e. the translation from the number of ex-
citation quanta into deposited energy, also necessitates good
knowledge of the energy required to produce single scintil-
lation photons or ionisation electrons in liquid xenon. The
sum of these excitation quanta is directly proportional to the
deposited energy in the target. The proportionality constant
is the mean excitation energy and is commonly known as
W -value. Here we present a measurement of the W -value
with electronic recoil interactions in a small dual-phase
xenon time projection chamber with a hybrid (photomulti-
plier tube and silicon photomultipliers) photosensor conﬁg-
uration. Our result is based on calibrations at O(1 − 10 keV)
with internal 37Ar and 83mKr sources and single electron
events. We obtain a value of W = 11.5 +0.2
−0.3 (syst.) eV, with
negligible statistical uncertainty, which is lower than previ-
ously measured at these energies. If further conﬁrmed, our
result will be relevant for modelling the absolute response
of liquid xenon detectors to particle interactions.

1 Introduction

Liquid xenon (LXe) is widely used as both sensitive target
and radiation source in time projection chambers (TPCs)
for present and future rare event searches. These include
e.g. searches for neutrinoless double beta decay [1–3], the
extremely rare decay of 124Xe via double electron cap-
ture [4, 5], the measurement of low-energy solar neutri-
nos [6], searches for solar axions, axion-like particles and

dark photons [7–9] as well as for WIMP (weakly interact-
ing massive particle) dark matter in the GeV to TeV mass
range. In particular, TPCs operated in dual-phase mode with
a gaseous xenon (GXe) layer at the top are among the lead-
ing technologies in the past, present and near-future hunt for
WIMPs [10–16].

A particle that deposits energy in LXe yields scintilla-
tion photons in the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) range with a
peak centred at 175−178 nm wavelength [17,18], ionisation
electrons and heat via atomic motion, where only the former
two processes are detectable with dual-phase TPCs. Photo-
sensors detect the prompt scintillation light (S1) which is
composed of direct scintillation of the xenon atoms and light
from the recombination of xenon ions with electrons. In both
mechanisms, scintillation light is produced by de-excitation
of xenon dimers that form from xenon excitons and xenon
atoms. Electrons that do not recombine are vertically drifted
and extracted to the gas phase, by means of an electric drift
and extraction ﬁeld, where they collide with xenon atoms.
In this process, a secondary proportional scintillation sig-
nal (S2) is produced by electroluminescence which is also
detected by photosensors. Due to energy conservation, the
size of the signals from scintillation and ionisation are anti-
correlated [19]. The recombination fraction and thus the en-
ergy distribution between these is drift ﬁeld dependent. We
collectively refer to scintillation and ionisation as excitation
in this work.

The number of scintillation photons nγ and ionisation
electrons ne− in an electronic recoil interaction is linearly
related to the deposited energy E by the constant work func-
tion W [20]:

E = (nγ + ne−)W .

(1)

The W -value can be regarded as the average energy needed
to produce a single free quantum in LXe and the above ex-
pression as its deﬁning equation. It determines the underly-

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

ing recombination-independent energy scale in a LXe detec-
tor that detects both scintillation light and ionisation charge.
Note that we implicitly assume here that every recombining
electron-ion pair leads to the production of one photon.

The widely employed numerical value of W is (13.7 ±
0.2) eV measured at ∼ 100 keV by E. Dahl [20]. However, a
W -value of (11.5±0.1 (stat.)±0.5 (syst.)) eV was measured
in the EXO-200 experiment with various gamma sources at
O(1 MeV) [21]. A list of other measurements of the W -value
can be found in the same reference. The deviation of the
EXO-200 value from former measurements motivated this
study at keV-scale energies, deploying internal 37Ar and
83mKr sources. The measurements were performed in our
small dual-phase xenon TPC Xurich II, which is equipped
with a bottom photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a silicon pho-
tomultiplier (SiPM) top array [22].

This article is structured as follows: In Sec. 2 we out-
line the deployed experimental method, introduce brieﬂy the
setup and the data on which we base our analysis. In Sec. 3
we show the data analysis of the various inputs for the cal-
culation of the W -value. The systematic uncertainties on the
measurement and the applied data corrections are detailed in
Sec. 4. In particular, we provide a study of a possible dou-
ble photoelectron emission in SiPMs in Appendix A. We
present the ﬁnal result in Sec. 5 and discuss, interpret and
summarise our ﬁndings in Sec. 6.

2 Experimental approach

2.1 Measurement principle

We rewrite Eq. 1 with the scintillation gain g1 := S1/nγ and
the ionisation gain g2 := S2/ne−, such that W reads

W = g2

E
g2
g1 S1 + S2

.

(2)

Thus, the W -value can be determined from the following
inputs: an event population in S1-S2-space of a known cali-
bration source yielding electronic recoils at an energy E, an
independent measurement of the gain parameter g2 and the
(negative) slope g2/g1 of the ﬁrst order polynomial in ioni-
sation (charge) yield versus scintillation (light) yield space.
We refer to the latter representation of the anti-correlation of
the S1 and S2 signals as Doke plot [23] and show a schematic
in Fig. 1.

Alternatively to this local approach, evaluated at a cer-
tain energy and scaled by the slope of the anti-correlation
line in the Doke plot, we can extrapolate to S1 = 0, i.e. to
the intercept with the charge yield axis, and obtain the global
expression (see Fig. 1)

Fig. 1 Schematic of the Doke plot in charge yield (QY) versus light
yield (LY) space for an interaction energy E. Measurements of the
charge and light yield at different electric drift ﬁelds or interaction en-
ergies would yield the solid line. The dashed line, making the relation
to the gain parameters g1 and g2 apparent, is obtained by a scaling of
this space with W . While the local approach uses a point on the anti-
correlation line and its (negative) slope g2/g1, the global one uses the
(reciprocal) QY-axis intercept. Both require an independent measure-
ment of the gain parameter g2.

Besides the gain parameter g2, the only input here is the
extrapolated (reciprocal) offset of the anti-correlation line at
zero light yield. Both the ratio of gains g2/g1 as well as
the offset S2/E at S1 = 0 require at least S1 and S2 data
of a single energy line at two different electric drift ﬁelds
or two different energy lines at one electric drift ﬁeld. For
more than two light and charge yield pairs, one performs a
linear ﬁt in the Doke plot whose accuracy depends on the
separation in the S2/S1 ratio and on the yield errors.

Besides the parameters of the anti-correlation ﬁt, both
approaches require an independent measurement of the gain
parameter g2 as input. To that end, we observe that for a sin-
gle electron (SE) that is extracted to the gas phase, we have
g2 = S2. Hence, a measurement of the SE event population
with the S2 signal yields the gain parameter g2.

2.2 Experimental setup

Xurich II is a dual-phase xenon TPC with a cylindrical
31 mm × 31 mm drift region that provides external electric
drift ﬁelds of up to ∼ 1 kV/cm, applied between the cathode
and the gate mesh. For the presented data, it was operated
with a 10 kV/cm (5.4 kV/cm) gas (liquid) extraction ﬁeld,
applied between the gate and the anode mesh which are
at 4 mm distance. It is equipped with a single 2-inch PMT
(R6041-06 MOD, Hamamatsu Photonics) at the bottom and

a 4 × 4 SiPM array (2x2 array of S13371, Hamamatsu Pho-
tonics) at the top and allows for a precise three-dimensional
event position reconstruction with a resolution of ∼ 1.5 mm
in the horizontal plane. The detector was operated such that
the GXe was kept at a pressure of 2.0 bar and the LXe was
slightly below its boiling point at 177 K. Under these condi-
tions, LXe has a density of 2861 kg/m3 [24]. The detector
was kept in this state during the calibration runs and the ther-
modynamical parameters only varied slightly over the data
acquisition periods: the pressure and LXe temperature range
was 0.05 bar and 0.4 K, respectively. The gas recirculation
ﬂow through the hot metal getter, crucial for the LXe purity
(see Sec. 4.1.1), was stable within 0.5 − 0.6 slpm (slpm –
standard litre per minute). A detailed description of the de-
vice, the data acquisition (DAQ) and processing, the event
reconstruction as well as the 37Ar and 83mKr analysis proce-
dures can be found in Ref. [22].

2.3 Data

We base our analysis on high-statistics calibration data in
S1-S2-space from two different runs with internal 37Ar and
83mKr sources [22]. 37Ar provides an energy line at 2.82 keV
from a K-shell electron capture [25]. 83mKr offers two en-
ergy lines at 32.15 keV and 9.41 keV from an isometric
transition. The two lines are the result of an intermediate
decay state with a half-life of 155.1 ns [26]. If they are
not resolved separately at short delay times, due to detec-
tion or data processing limitations, or if they are purposely
merged in the data analysis, we observe the combined en-
ergy of 41.56 keV. Data sets acquired at electric drift ﬁelds
of 80−968 V/cm for 37Ar and of 484−968 V/cm for 83mKr
are used.

As mentioned in Sec. 2.1, the ionisation gain parame-
ter g2 is determined based on the observed SE events with
S2 signals only. These events occur at a high rate of ∼ 17 Hz
in the detector volume and are homogeneously distributed
in the horizontal plane. However, using a centre-of-gravity
algorithm as described in Ref. [22], it is clear that SE events
with e.g. only one photon in the top array are reconstructed
at the centre of the hit photosensor. This natural limitation of
the position reconstruction in the single photon regime does
however not affect the analysis. A systematical variation of
the ﬁducial radius did not show any signiﬁcant change of
the bottom, top or total SE charge yield up to radii close
to the TPC boundary. The SE event population in dual-
phase TPCs is well-known but its origin not yet fully un-
derstood [27–31]. In the given references, a time-correlation
to high-energy depositions is observed as well as a depen-
dence on the concentration of electronegative impurities in
the LXe. Single electrons can originate from a delayed ex-
traction to the gas phase, from trapped charge on the TPC
surfaces or from electron emission at the cathode. Other pro-
duction mechanisms involve stimulation by the VUV scin-
tillation light, such as photodetachment from impurities or
photoelectric effect on metal surfaces [27]. In case of the
deployed 37Ar source, the M-shell electron capture process
at 17.5 eV [25] could cause, based on the branching ratio
with the K-shell, a small fraction of ∼ 0.5 % of this SE pop-
ulation. The origin of these electrons is however not relevant
for this analysis as they all share the same signal topology.
We extract the SE population from the 37Ar data sets since
these were acquired with a low trigger threshold of 7 mV on
the PMT channel [22]. Because of the highly abundant one

4

by one extraction of electrons at high g21, the SE population
is readily identiﬁed and isolated (cf. Fig. 2).

4 Systematic uncertainties and corrections

3 Data analysis

3.1 Single electron gain

To identify and isolate the SE event population, we apply the
following data selection and quality criteria: a cut to remove
saturated events, a single scatter cut on the PMT channel and
a ﬁducial radius cut such as developed in Ref. [22]. In ad-
dition, we apply an S2-only cut, i.e. we remove events with
an S1 signal in the PMT waveform. Furthermore, we require
that the trigger was issued on the S2 signal, i.e. we keep
events whose PMT S2 signal is located within a tight time
window of [−100, +130] ns around the trigger. An S2-width
cut of [110, 550] ns further cleans up the population. The
S2-width increases with the depth of the interaction in the
TPC due to the vertical diffusion of the electron cloud during
the drift. Higher electric ﬁelds allow for higher drift speeds
that reduce the effect of diffusion [32].

The mean of the Gaussian ﬁt of the population is
constant within the parameter uncertainty for the consid-
ered drift ﬁelds. We show the result for the 968 V/cm
data sets in Fig. 2. A Gaussian ﬁt of the bare, i.e. non-
corrected, spectrum yields g2 = (37.05 ± 0.01 (stat.) ±
0.50 (syst.)) PE/e−. Incorporating the DPE/crosstalk cor-
rection as well as the DAQ and processing efﬁciencies, dis-
cussed in Secs. 4.2.2 and 4.3.1, we obtain g2 = (29.84 ±
0.01 (stat.) ± 0.40 (syst.)) PE/e−. While the DPE/crosstalk
correction shifts the SE spectrum by ∼ 14 %, the DAQ and
processing efﬁciencies contribute by another ∼ 6 %.

3.2 Anti-correlation ﬁt parameters

In Fig. 3, we show the means of the 37Ar and 83mKr popula-
tions at the considered drift ﬁelds in charge versus light yield
space (see Ref. [22] for the elliptical ﬁts of the populations in
S1-S2-space and also Fig. 4, right). In the left plot, we show
the ﬁt with the split 32.15 keV and 9.41 keV lines and in the
right one the merged 41.56 keV line. Although the 41.56 keV
line is not subject to the effect of the peak-splitting routine,
that is discussed in Sec. 4.3.2, it does not yield more precise
results of the ﬁt parameters on the anti-correlation line due
to its smaller span in S1-S2-space. However, we ﬁnd both
ﬁts to be compatible within errors. From the linear ﬁt on
the left of Fig. 3 we obtain a (negative) slope of g2/g1 =
289.5 ± 0.1 (stat.) +11.3
−7.1 (syst.) and a charge yield axis inter-
cept of S2/E = (2.596 ± 0.001 (stat.) +0.052
−0.034 (syst.)) PE/eV.

1Based on our previous analysis [22], we expect a high g2 of 30 −
40 PE/e− (PE – photoelectron) for an assumed W -value of 11 − 14 eV.

A determination of the absolute energy scale of a LXe de-
tector requires a careful treatment of the systematic uncer-
tainties and efﬁciencies that impact the result. Below, we
discuss in detail both relevant sources and those that were
identiﬁed to be negligible, as well as data corrections that
were applied whenever possible. We provide a summary of
all treated systematic effects and corrections in Table 1.

4.1 TPC effects

4.1.1 Liquid xenon purity and TPC geometry

For a given energy deposition, the size of the S1 and S2 sig-
nals depend on the vertical depth of the interaction in the
TPC and thus, on the drift time. Electrons can attach to elec-
tronegative impurities in the LXe during their drift. This
charge loss reduces the size of the S2 signal with increas-
ing drift time and is quantiﬁed by the free electron lifetime.
In addition, the light collection in the top and bottom pho-
tosensors is subject to the geometry of the TPC, and to the
optical properties of the TPC surfaces and the LXe, and thus
also features a dependence on the drift time. To minimise ge-
ometry effects, ensure good performance of the position re-
construction algorithm, and to reduce the material-induced
background and the effect of electric ﬁeld distortions, we
ﬁducialise our active volume like in Ref. [22]. In addition,
we apply corrections on the S1 and S2 signals as detailed in
the same reference. Note that the SE S2 signal is not subject
to any drift time dependence. In this analysis, the PE-scale
of both S1 and S2 top signals is ﬁxed utilising the single
PE resolution of the SiPMs, see Fig. 2, right (cf. Ref. [22],
Sec. 5.1.2 for the S1 top correction). However, such a cor-
rection is not accessible for the bottom signals due to the
lack of single PE resolution of the PMT.

4.1.2 Electron extraction efﬁciency

The electron extraction efﬁciency from the liquid to the
gas phase can be assumed to be ∼ 100 % at a gas (liq-
uid) extraction ﬁeld of 10 kV/cm (5.4 kV/cm). We base
this assumption on various former measurements that ap-
plied different methods. Among these are early absolute
measurements directly comparing the ionisation signal be-
low and above the liquid surface [33, 34]. In XENON100
a relative measurement was performed, comparing the
recombination- and electron lifetime-corrected S2 signals of
mono-energetic sources to the expected number of produced
electrons [27]. XENON1T compared the g2 obtained from
the anti-correlation ﬁt of several mono-energetic sources
(assuming a literature W -value) and the g2 from the low-
est S2 signals [35]. However, more recent relative measure-

Ref. [22]. Left: Including the split 9.41 keV and 32.15 keV 83mKr lines with asymmetric error bars from the splitting routine, see Sec. 4.3.2. Right:

ments imply that the extraction efﬁciency might only be
89 − 95 % at the extraction ﬁeld of interest [36, 37]. These
were searching for saturation of the ratio of the S2 signals of
mono-energetic calibration sources and the SE S2 at increas-
ing extraction ﬁelds. As noted in Ref. [36], such measure-
ments are, however, highly subject to systematic uncertain-
ties from the geometry of the extraction region. In Ref. [37]
the discrepancy to earlier relative measurements is attributed
to scaling factors that arise when an independent determina-
tion of the number of initially produced electrons is lacking.
In summary, the literature on this topic appears inconclusive
and lacks a detailed uniﬁed explanation of the discrepancies
between all the used methods. For this reason, we assume an
electron extraction efﬁciency of 100 % in this study and con-
sider the consequence of this effect on our analysis. While
a lower extraction efﬁciency would only diminish the statis-
tics of the SE population, it would reduce the charge yield of
the calibration lines and thus, if disregarded, yield a higher
W -value when determined via Eqs. 2 and 3. We further com-
ment on the effect in Sec. 6.

4.1.3 Liquid level

The 37Ar and 83mKr calibrations were conducted in two sep-
arate runs with a complete xenon recovery and ﬁlling proce-
dure in between. The levelling procedure gives rise to an
uncertainty of the liquid-gas interface of ±125 µm between
the runs which is nominally kept in the middle of the gate
and anode mesh. This in turn impacts the S2 signal ampli-
ﬁcation. A systematic study of this effect with 83mKr data
shows that the levelling uncertainty corresponds to a max-
imum S2-uncertainty of 2.5 %. However, we only include
this uncertainty in the 83mKr data points of Fig. 3 where we
use information of both runs for the anti-correlation ﬁt, and
assume the liquid level to be constant within the runs, due to

stable thermodynamic conditions, and uniform in the hori-
zontal plane.

4.2 Photosensor effects

We note that Eqs. 2, 3 are insensitive to an overall factor
linear in g1, g2, S1, S2 that is constant in time, energy and
common to the PMT and SiPMs. For instance, the result is
insensitive to a scaling of the conversion from ADC bins
to PE due to e.g. the read-out electronics as long as it con-
cerns both top and bottom sensors. However, as we discuss
in Sec. 6, the data shows a dependence of the relative light
and charge yields of the top and bottom photosensors on the
respective energy line, see Table 2. Therefore, we do expect
an inﬂuence of the hybrid photosensor conﬁguration from
systematically different characteristics of PMTs and SiPMs.
Two classes of such characteristics can be distinguished:
time-dependent and time-constant ones. Photosensor gains
can generally show a time-dependence, e.g. due to the aging
of the photocathode [38]. Since we did not measure all in-
put quantities for W at the same point in time, a systematic
gain change could impact the result even though all of the
input quantities in the Eqs. 2 and 3 scale with the gain in the
same fashion. All other characteristics treated subsequently
are expected to be constant in time as long as the thermody-
namic conditions are unchanged. For the considered inter-
actions the photosensors are operated in the linear regime of
their dynamical range and thus, we expect the characteristics
to be independent of the interaction energy.

4.2.1 Photosensor gain

The photosensor gains were determined weekly with an
LED calibration [22] and have shown to be stable in time.
We measured a PMT gain of (3.76 ± 0.06) × 106. The gain

6

variations among the SiPM channels are small (< 6 %). The
signals of the channels are however scaled individually with
their mean gain. The error-weighted SiPM mean gain is
(3.12 ± 0.01) × 106. The uncertainties on the gain measure-
ments represent one standard deviation of the gain distribu-
tions of the photosensors which we use as an estimator for a
systematic change over the period of data acquisition.

4.2.2 Double photoelectron emission and crosstalk

Double photoelectron emission (DPE), i.e. the emission of
two primary electrons originating from a single photon im-
pacting the photocathode, is well-known for PMTs [39–
41]. We use a DPE probability of (20 ± 5) % for the
R6041-06 MOD PMT and correct for it. On the other hand,
the working principle of SiPMs disfavours the existence of
such an external enhancement effect. The output of a sin-
gle cell is independent of the excess number of impacting
photons and thus, light detection with SiPMs relies on the
fact that, within their linear regime, the signal size is pro-
portional to the number of triggered cells. The only known
effect that increases the light signal of an isolated SiPM is
the internal crosstalk among neighbouring cells, i.e. from a
photon crossing the trench and triggering another avalanche
in a nearby cell. The internal crosstalk probability is usually
determined from dark counts inside the cells which provides
a good source of single PEs [42]. We show in Appendix A
that for the S13371 SiPMs we do not see an excess with
external scintillation light due to a DPE or DPE-mimicking
effect beyond the internal crosstalk probability and conclude
that the enhancement probability is (2.2 ± 0.1) %, an effect
for which we correct as well.

Besides the internal crosstalk among neighbouring cells
of a single sensor, SiPMs are known to feature an exter-
nal crosstalk capability among different sensors [43]. Pho-
tons produced during electron avalanches can, instead of

travelling to another cell, escape the sensor and eventually
reach another one where they trigger a secondary avalanche.
Such an effect must be estimated in situ as it is geometry-
dependent. To this end, we acquired scintillation-free dark
count data with nitrogen gas under thermodynamic condi-
tions very similar to those during the calibration runs us-
ing xenon [22]. Since dark counts of different sensors are
uncorrelated, the external crosstalk probability can be esti-
mated from correlated events of a few PE in size. We obtain
a mean external effective crosstalk probability of a SiPM in
the top photosensor array of (0.05 ± 0.01) %. The light col-
lection of the top SiPMs is thus expected to be enhanced
by this amount. This result is corrected by the probability
that a given sensor is in uncorrelated coincidence with any
other sensor of the array within the examined trigger time
window of 40 ns. We measured this accidental probability
to be 0.02 % from coincidences outside of the trigger win-
dow, in agreement with expectation for a mean dark count
rate of (8.05 ± 0.03) Hz/mm2 [22]. We do not expect the
estimated external crosstalk probability among SiPM chan-
nels to change to a signiﬁcant value, compared to the in-
ternal one, when the TPC is operated with xenon in dual-
phase mode. During operation with LXe, an external SiPM
crosstalk recorded by the PMT would be visible as a small
coincident S1-only signal in the PMT and a SiPM channel.
However, we did not observe any event of this kind e.g. dur-
ing the 37Ar calibration at 968 V/cm drift ﬁeld. In summary,
the external SiPM crosstalk effect can safely be neglected
as it is subdominant to the internal one and no effect on the
PMT is seen.

4.2.3 Photon detection efﬁciency

The manufacturer Hamamatsu Photonics claims for the
VUV4 S13371 SiPMs a saturation photon detection efﬁ-
ciency (PDE) of 24 % at 175 nm and 25 °C operated at 4 V

overvoltage without crosstalk and afterpulsing [44]. How-
ever, SiPM characterisations for the nEXO experiment im-
ply a much lower saturation PDE of 9.9 − 17.6 %, measured
at 3.3 − 3.8 V overvoltage and 233 K, that differs by 8 %
among devices [45,46]. We are operating the SiPMs at more
than 4 V overvoltage [22]. In view of these measurements,
we can thus assume a typical PDE of 18 %. Hamamatsu Pho-
tonics provided us with the spectral response curve of the
R6041-06 MOD PMT that shows a peak quantum efﬁciency
(QE) of ∼ 30 % at 175 nm. The MOD speciﬁcation sets a
minimum QE of 25 % at that wavelength as requirement.
An independent measurement shows a QE of ∼ 28 % [47].
The electron collection efﬁciency of that PMT was speciﬁed
with ∼ 70 % upon enquiry to the manufacturer. We can thus
conclude that the typical PDE of that PMT is 20 %. Since
the SiPMs and the PMT have similar typical PDEs with a
percent-level difference, systematics from the PDE differ-
ence are negligible for this analysis.

4.2.4 Infrared sensitivity

Apart from emitting light in the VUV region, GXe is known
to emit signiﬁcantly in the infrared (IR) [48, 49]: it features
a strong line at 1300 nm wavelength at a VUV-comparable
zero-ﬁeld light yield of (21±3) photons/keV2 at 2 bar, mea-
sured with α-particles at 4.3 MeV [51]. LXe features a dif-
ferent IR scintillation spectrum which emits mostly below
1200 nm but with a very poor yield [50]. For this reason,
only the S2 light can contain a signiﬁcant amount of IR ra-
diation. However, both photosensor types are insensitive at
these wavelengths and thus IR-scintillation does not con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to our signals. For the SiPMs, the band
gap of silicon sets a sensitivity cutoff at ∼ 1100 nm. Ac-
cording to the manufacturer, the PMT is insensitive beyond
1000 nm which is conﬁrmed by the trend of the spectral re-
sponse curve in Ref. [52] that shows a vanishing QE for
wavelengths above 650 nm.

4.3 Data acquisition and processing effects

4.3.1 Detection and tagging efﬁciency

As mentioned in Sec. 2.3, the DAQ settings during the 37Ar
calibration period allowed us to trigger on 7 mV PMT sig-
nals. Naturally, the trigger efﬁciency of signals that have
comparable or lower amplitudes is reduced which is particu-
larly relevant for SE S2 signals. The translation from signal
amplitude to signal charge depends on the signal type. We
employ a data-driven approach for the SE population, using
their amplitude-over-width ratio as discriminator to obtain a

sumed to be the true value considering Ref. [50].

detection efﬁciency, as shown in Fig. 2, left. To this end, we
consider the fraction of SE peaks that did not issue a trig-
ger in events in which a subsequent larger signal triggered.
Based on the same discriminator, we obtain the tagging ef-
ﬁciency of the processor to correctly identify SE events as
S2 signals, see the same ﬁgure. We correct the SE popula-
tion for these efﬁciencies and assume that these are 100 %
for larger signals.

4.3.2 Peak-splitting routine

In order to separate the distinct peaks of the 32.15 keV and
the 9.41 keV line of 83mKr, our raw-data processor splits at
the intermediate minimum whenever a moving average of
the waveform has fallen below half of maximum values of
both peaks. This algorithm was chosen for its simplicity and
good performance as it avoids ﬁtting and has no need for
a waveform template. Assuming Gaussian shape, we esti-
mated in Ref. [22] the typical leakage into the neighbouring
peak, caused by the processor, to be ≤ 10 %.

Here, we use a data-driven approach based on the ac-
tual shape of the photosensor signals to obtain a reliable es-
timate of the maximally possible leakage between the two
peaks. To this end, we select a few hundred well-separated
S2 signal pairs with a delay of at least 1.2 µs3 and shift
the small 9.41 keV S2 towards the large 32.15 keV S2 up
to the point where splitting, according to the algorithm, is
still just about possible. Integration of the charge and com-
parison to the isolated peaks conﬁrms the expectation that
the leakage is directed from the large to the small S2 sig-
nal. The maximum errors of the PMT (SiPM) signals are
(−2.0 ± 1.3) % ((−3.7 ± 1.9) %) for the 32.15 keV line and
(+10.2 ± 5.9) % ((+19.2 ± 8.4)%) for the 9.41 keV line. A
positive (negative) error indicates here that the S2 peak is re-
constructed with a higher (lower) charge. Since a correction
for any given S2-delay would be rather uncertain, we will
propagate these maximum errors.

We observe that the splitting algorithm only allows
for a minimal 83mKr S2-delay of ∼ 400 ns (see Fig. 4,
left) at which S1 signals, that feature widths in the range
60 − 140 ns, are well-separated. The delay distribution peaks
at ∼ 700 ns and falls exponentially towards higher separa-
tion. At such large separations, no delay dependence of the
S1 signals could be observed, unlike at shorter delays where
corrections are needed [53].

4.3.3 Fitting procedure

The two-dimensional 2.82 keV distribution in S1-S2-space,
shown in Fig. 4, right, features a slight asymmetry (skew-
ness) that was also observed elsewhere [54, 55]. This is due

3The narrow 83mKr S2-width distribution is maximal at 0.6 µs and thus
for delays > 1.2 µs, the waveform has basically fallen to baseline-level
in between the peaks.

to DAQ and processing efﬁciencies, the low light level or
charge loss and can be modelled with skew-Gaussians [56].
However, here the shape of the distribution is of less rele-
vance to the analysis for we only extract its mean. It is thus
sufﬁcient to use a standard Gaussian ﬁt and instead estimate
the uncertainty on the mean. To this end, and in addition to
the standard ﬁt parameter errors, we systematically varied
the ﬁt interval, including asymmetric intervals. This effect is
more pronounced in the S1- than in the S2-direction and ac-
counts for an S1-uncertainty of +0.7
−4.1 % and an S2-uncertainty
of +0.2
−0.7 %. In Ref. [55] the larger S1 bias is explained by the
fact that only upward S1 ﬂuctuations above the S1 threshold
are measured at such low light levels.

We evaluate Eq. 3 for the measurements of Sec. 3, consid-
ering the systematics and corrections of the previous sec-
tion, and obtain W = 11.5 +0.2
−0.3 (syst.) eV. We do not quote
a statistical uncertainty as it is subdominant compared to
the systematic effects which are mainly due to the photo-
sensor gain uncertainties, and the parameter errors of the
anti-correlation ﬁt. The latter come mostly from the liquid
level uncertainty and the 83mKr-S2 splitting routine. The
overall uncertainty is obtained from a propagation of the
contributing uncertainties. The correlations of the inputs are
maximal, however, these do not increase the ﬁnal uncer-
tainty much. Determining the W -value with the local ap-
proach using Eq. 2 at any of the considered S1-S2-space
populations of the calibration sources yields compatible re-
sults with mean values in the range W = 11.1 − 11.6 eV with
slightly higher errors due to the less direct nature of the ap-
proach.

6 Discussion and conclusion

We observe slightly different relative light and charge yields
of the top and bottom photosensors, depending on the se-
lected event population, see Table 2. As there is no fun-
damental physical reason for such differences, we attribute
these to systematic effects discussed in Sec. 4. For instance,
the peak-splitting routine increases the charge yield of the
9.41 keV 83mKr line while it slightly reduces the one of the
32.15 keV line and leaves the light yield of both lines un-
changed (see Sec. 4.3.2). The slightly higher relative PMT
charge yield in SE events could be due to an unquantiﬁed
systematic deﬁciency of our processing framework, leading
to a higher (smaller) reconstructed charge in the single PE
regime of the bottom (top) sensors. However, in lack of a
thorough explanation of the deviations shown in Table 2,
we would like to remark that a physical effect enhancing
(reducing) the photosensor charge yield in the SE regime
would increase (decrease) g2 and the resulting W-value. All
photosensor effects were weighted with the relative yields
in Table 2 when applied to the combined, top and bottom,
signals. We note however, that the inﬂuence of the hybrid
photosensor characteristics on the ﬁnal result is suppressed
by the fact that the weights are very similar and the effect
would in particular vanish for equal weights, cf. discussion
in Sec. 4.2.

As mentioned in Sec. 4.1.2, we did not consider an elec-
tron extraction deﬁciency in this study. We note however,
that the resulting W -value would only be lower than the ob-
tained one when correcting for an imperfect extraction ef-
ﬁciency. Because the incorporation of this systematic is a
straightforward scaling of the charge yields of the 37Ar and
83mKr lines and thus, of the W -value, we do not include the

effect of a potential non-unity extraction efﬁciency in the
lower error bound of the ﬁnal result.

Based on SE events and data from low-energy internal
37Ar and 83mKr calibration sources in a small dual-phase
TPC, we have measured the mean electronic excitation en-
ergy of LXe to be W = 11.5 +0.2
−0.3 (syst.) eV, with negligible
statistical uncertainty. Although Eqs. 2 and 3 are widely in-
sensitive to the different photosensor characteristics of PMT
and SiPMs, we carefully treated the known systematic devi-
ations. In particular, we presented in Appendix A a combi-
natorial approach to search for a DPE effect in SiPMs based
on SE data and found no excess beyond the known crosstalk
effect. Additionally, we considered the systematic uncertain-
ties from TPC, DAQ and data processing effects.

Albeit affected by various sources of systematics, our
result features a competitive uncertainty range compared to
former measurements. It is compatible with the W -value of
(11.5 ± 0.1 (stat.) ± 0.5 (syst.)) eV reported by the EXO-200
Collaboration [21] at O(1 MeV) energies which, thus, is re-
producible at keV-scale energies. The EXO-200 experiment
was a single-phase LXe detector with a wire charge readout.
An external charge-injection allowed for an absolute calibra-
tion of the ampliﬁer on the readout plane. The uncertainty on
the EXO-200 result is dominated by the calibrations of the
light and charge response of the detector.

However, the W -value found here is lower than deter-
mined in other former measurements [23, 57]. In particular,
it is incompatible with the established value measured by
E. Dahl of (13.7 ± 0.2) eV [20] which was determined in a
LXe detector of comparable size with 122 keV and 136 keV
gamma rays from an external 57Co source. The detector was
operated in dual-phase and single-phase mode. For the lat-
ter, an ampliﬁer on the anode allowed for a direct calibration
of the charge yield used to measure the gain g2. The calibra-
tion of the ampliﬁer was also the dominant source of uncer-
tainty for the ﬁnal result. In dual-phase mode, the detector
was operated at the same extraction ﬁeld as Xurich II and
thus, the higher value found by E. Dahl cannot be explained

9

by a lower electron extraction efﬁciency. The difference to
our obtained value would stay constant for lower extraction
efﬁciencies.

In order to check whether this discrepancy to former
measurements is due to a higher observed absolute yield
in the scintillation or ionisation channel, we can compare
our result to predictions of the Noble Element Simulation
Technique (NEST) [58]. From our measurements of g2 and
g2/g1 in Sec. 3 we can calculate the corrected scintillation
gain to be g1 = 0.103 +0.003
−0.004 PE/γ. Using the deﬁnitions of
g1 and g2 (cf. Sec. 2.1), we obtain at 2.82 keV and 968 V/cm
drift ﬁeld on average the following number of excitation
quanta from our measurements: nγ = 115.6 and ne− = 130.4.
At this energy and drift ﬁeld, and for the LXe density
given in Sec. 2.2, the NEST calculator [59] predicts absolute
= 85.8 (71.1) and nNEST
yields of nNEST
e− = 120.2 (134.9),
respectively, for the gamma (beta) model. Thus, the dis-
crepancy is mostly seen in the scintillation channel and we
observed S1 signals with a higher yield than predicted by
NEST. Qualitatively, the same is seen at higher energies or
lower drift ﬁelds.

γ

A change of the numerical value of W does not inﬂuence
the translation from S1 and S2 signals into deposited energy
when performing measurements relative to calibration lines.
According to Eq. 2, a lower W -value will generally reduce
the microscopic detector response parameters g1 and g2 and
thus, the absolute energy response to excitation quanta. As
we have seen from the comparison with NEST, the rescaling
will be mostly in the g1 value.

The Fano factor F accounts for the non-Poissonian na-
ture of the intrinsic ﬂuctuation of the number of quanta
n := nγ + ne− produced in an interaction [60–62]. At the
recombination-independent combined scintillation and ion-
isation energy scale of ER interactions (cf. Eq. 1), we can
write:

√

This expression is related to the (intrinsic) energy resolution

(6)

Thus, for a measured energy resolution, the Fano factor can
be determined based on W [64], and a lower value of W
would imply a higher Fano factor.

Due to these implications, we expect our work to pro-
voke other independent measurements of the W -value and
studies as to the origin of the deviation of almost 20 % com-
pared to other low-energy measurements. New measure-
ments of the W -value in LXe would also provide valuable

10

input to NEST [58], which aims to model the absolute light
and charge yields in LXe detectors for different energies and
electric drift ﬁelds.

Appendix A: Search for DPE in SiPMs

We apply a combinatorial approach on the SE population
to determine the probability q that a 2 PE signal originates
from one initial incoming photon onto the photocathode. We
assume that q is universal to all channels. Given a ﬁducial
radius, let {pi}i=0,...,15 be the set of mean light fractions of
the 16 SiPMs for homogeneously distributed SE events. Fur-
thermore, we denote the number of recorded hits in sensor i
by ki. For good statistics in the SE population, we consider
events with 3 detected hits and we call the total number of
these events N3h. Then, we can distinguish three cases4:

ki = 3, k j = 0 ∀ j (cid:54)= i. This signal can be produced by
I.
3, 2 or 1 initial photons. The latter process is next-to-next-
to-leading order and thus highly suppressed. However, we
will discard this ﬁrst case as no such events were recorded,
for it is a highly improbable event topology, and it is thus
not accessible here. Note, that this is not due to the twofold
coincidence requirement of the event building because addi-
tional PMT-triggers are allowed.

ki = 2, kl = 1, k j = 0 ∀ j (cid:54)= l (cid:54)= i. This signal can be
produced by 3 or 2 initial photons. We expect the following

The following mean light collection fractions of the sen-
sors, that are arranged in a 4 × 4 array, can be deduced from
SE data for the same ﬁducial volume as used in the analysis
above: 4.6 % (corner sensors), 6.2 % (edge sensors), 8.0 %
(middle sensors). Those match well light simulations with
the GEANT4 particle physics simulation kit [65]. Integrat-
ing the SE spectra with the respective data selection cuts
(similar to Fig. 2, right) for NII, NIII and N2h, 2s yields q =
(2.2 ± 0.1) %, with Poissonian uncertainty. The crosstalk
probability of the VUV4 S13371 SiPMs was measured to be
2.1 % at 4 V overvoltage and 3.3 % at 5 V overvoltage, and
is widely constant with temperature [42]. We operated the
SiPMs in Xurich II at 51.5 V which corresponds to 5 V over-
voltage at a temperature of 190 K measured in the gas phase.
However, due to the heat dissipation of the pre-ampliﬁers
of ∼ 3 W, the temperature at the sensors is expected to be
slightly higher [22]. In fact, the overvoltage is reduced by
1 V below 220 K. In this regard, the determined probability
q is well within the range of the expected crosstalk and we
do not see an excess that points towards an external SiPM
DPE effect. Moreover, we can conclude that the crosstalk
determination based on dark counts inside the cells is well-
motivated as the result does not change when using an ex-
ternal source of single scintillation photons.
