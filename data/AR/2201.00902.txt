ABSTRACT

From high-resolution spectra, chemical abundances from collisionally excited lines (CELs) and optical recombination lines
(ORLs) have been determined for planetary nebulae Cn 3-1, Vy 2-2, Hu 2-1, Vy 1-2 and IC 4997, which are young and dense
objects. The main aim of this work is to derive their O+2/H+ Abundance Discrepancy Factors, ADFs, between CELs and ORLs.
He, O, N, Ne, Ar, S, and Cl abundances were obtained and our values are in agreement with those previously reported. We found
that Cn 3-1, Hu 2-1, and Vy 1-2 have O abundances typical of disc PNe, while Vy 2-2 and IC 4997 are low O abundance objects
(12 + log(O/H) ∼ 8.2), which can be attributed to possible O depletion into dust grains. ADFs(O+2) of 4.30+1.00

5.34+1.27
−2.71 were determined for Vy 2-2, Hu 2-1, Vy 1-2 and IC 4997, respectively. The kinematics of CELs and
ORLs was analysed for each case to study the possibility that diﬀerent coexisting plasmas in the nebula emit them. Expansion
velocities of [O iii] and O ii are equal within uncertainties in three PNe, providing no evidence for these lines being emitted in
diﬀerent zones. Exception are Hu 2-1 and Vy 2-2, where ORLs might be emitted in diﬀerent zones than CELs. For Vy 2-2 and
IC 4997 we found that nebular and auroral lines of the same ion (S+, N+, Ar+2, Ar+3, O+2) might present diﬀerent expansion
velocities. Auroral lines show lower Vexp which might indicate that they are emitted in a denser and inner zone than the nebular
ones.

1 INTRODUCTION

Planetary nebulae (PNe) are constituted by shells of ionized gas
expanding around an evolved hot central star which initially was
a low-intermediate mass star (1 − 8 M(cid:12)) and it is on the way to
become a white-dwarf. The shell was part of the stellar atmosphere
and it was ejected in an advanced stage of evolution, during the AGB
phase. Presently the central star has an eﬀective temperature between
30,000 K to 150,000 K and typical properties of the ionized shell are:
electron densities between 103 to 105 cm−3, electron temperatures
of about 10,000 K, and expansion velocities Vexp ∼ 20 − 30 km s−1.
The ionized shell possesses a stratiﬁed structure, with the more
ionized species nearer the central star. Usually the structure shows
an expansion velocity gradient, with larger velocities towards the
external zones where the less ionized species are found (Hubble law
ﬂow).

A large amount of heavy ions have been detected in the nebular
spectra through Collisionally Excited Lines (CELs) of N+, O+, S+,
S+2, O+2, Ne+2, Ar+2 and even lines of O+3, Ar+3, Ar+4 and Ne+4 can
be detected for the cases of very high stellar eﬀective temperature.
Optical Recombination Lines (ORLs) of H+, He+, He+2 are detected
in the spectrum, and faint recombination lines of heavy elements (C,
O, N, Ne, ...) have been detected also.

dance can be derived from CELs as well as from ORLs. It has been
found that the abundances of an ion determined from the two types of
lines do not coincide, generally the abundances from recombination
lines are larger than the ones derived from collisionally excited lines,
giving origin to a discrepancy known as the Abundance Discrepancy
Factor (ADF). Such a discrepancy has been object of numerous stud-
ies trying to understand its origin and to determine the true chemistry
of the nebulae, which constitutes a fundamental parameter to under-
stand the evolution of low-intermediate mass stars. Such ADFs are
found in H ii regions as well, with values usually between 1.5 and 3,
see, e.g., Liu (2012); Esteban et al. (2014) and references therein, but
in PNe it has a signiﬁcant tail extending towards much larger values.
Several solutions have been proposed to explain the ADF prob-
lem (see Espíritu & Peimbert 2021, for a complete list). The two
most important solutions have been extensively analysed. The ﬁrst
one is the presence of large temperature ﬂuctuations in a chemi-
cally homogeneous plasma (Peimbert et al. 2014, and references
therein); the ﬂuctuations are larger than those predicted by photoion-
ized models, and they have been used mainly to analyse ADFs in
H ii regions through the parameter 𝑡2 that represents the size of the
ﬂuctuations (Esteban et al. 2014). The second solution corresponds
to bi-abundance models where small H-deﬁcient inclusions would be
mixed with the H-rich hot plasma (Liu et al. 2000), these inclusions
would be cold (Te about 1,000 K) and heavy element recombination
lines would originate predominantly in this plasma.

According to Peimbert et al. (2014), who analysed more than 20

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Ruiz-Escobedo & Peña

PNe, ADF values as large as 9 can be explained by the presence of
thermal inhomogeneities in a chemically homogeneous plasma with-
out requiring the presence of the small inclusions proposed by Liu
et al. (2000). However in Peimbert et al. (2014) work the possibil-
ity of diﬀerent plasmas of slightly diﬀerent chemistry and physical
conditions, coexisting in the nebulae, cannot be discarded. This pos-
sibility can be studied through kinematic analysis and it is the one
that can be explored in this work where we analyse the chemistry and
the kinematics in a sample of nebulae.

Since some years ago our group have started the analysis of several
PNe to determine the physical conditions and chemistry in the ionized
gas by using CELs and ORLs, by means of spectrophotometric data
of high- and low-spectral resolution. In our previous work (Peña
et al. 2017) and in works by other authors, evidence of diﬀerent
plasmas, with diﬀerent chemistry and spatial location, existing in
some nebulae, has been reported: one plasma is more widespread,
it has low metallicity and high electron temperature, and it emits
mainly the CELs, the other has larger heavy-element abundances
and lower electron temperature, it is more concentrated towards the
inner nebular zone and produces mainly the ORLs (see, e.g., García-
Rojas et al. 2016; Richer et al. 2013).

In Peña et al. (2017), we analysed the kinematic of CELs and ORLs
for a sample of 14 Galactic PNe with [WC] central star and ADFs
≤5, ﬁnding that in several of them there is evidence of the existence
of two diﬀerent plasmas with diﬀerent characteristics producing the
CELs and ORLs, as mentioned above.

Our goal in this and upcoming articles is to enlarge that work and
to determine the ADFs for O+2 of samples of PNe with diﬀerent
properties (central star types, low and high densities, diﬀerent elec-
tron temperatures, diﬀerent chemistry) to verify the validity of the
hypothesis of two coexistent plasmas in PNe as a possible origin of
the ADF, and to search for possible correlations of ADFs with some
nebular characteristics. To do so, we analyse deep high-resolution
spectra to determine physical conditions, abundances, and expansion
velocities of CELs and ORLs, aiming to ﬁnd if the emission of these
lines arises from diﬀerent regions within the nebulae.

In this work, we present the analysis carried out for ﬁve young,
very high-density nebulae, three of which have been reported in the
literature to show ADFs larger than 4. The objects under study are
Cn 3-1 (PN G038.2+12.0), Vy 2-2 (PN G045.4-02.7), Hu 2-1 (PN
G051.9-03.8), Vy 1-2 (PN G053.3+24.0), and IC 4997 (PN G058.3-
10.9), whose main characteristics are presented in Table 1. Although
some of these objects have been analysed previously by other authors,
it is important to redetermine the physical conditions, the chemistry
and the ADFs provided by CELs and ORLs in them in a homogeneous
manner, by using the same procedures to analyse our data with up-to-
date atomic parameters and to determine the uncertainties involved.
In addition, we analyse the kinematic behaviour of CELs and ORLs
that has not been done previously for these objects.

This paper is organised as follows. In §2 the PN characteristics,
observations and data reduction procedures are given. In §3 the phys-
ical parameters derived from CELs and ORLs for each object, are
presented. In §4 ionic abundances from CELs are calculated, while
ionic abundances from ORLs are computed in §5. Total abundances
are presented in §6. The nebular expansion velocities, derived for the
diﬀerent ions from their CELs and ORLs are discussed in §7. The
results for individual nebulae can be found in §8. Our discussion and
conclusions are presented in §9.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

To derive the chemical abundances from ORLs, high resolution spec-
tra (𝛿𝜆 better than 0.5 Å/pix) are required because these lines appear
generally blended with other ORLs or stellar lines. Therefore, for
data acquisition we used the highest spectral resolution instrument
available.

Some of the objects presented here have been observed by us since
2001, with the echelle REOSC spectrograph, attached to the 2.1-m
telescope of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional, at San Pedro
Mártir, B.C., México, OAN-SPM. Most recent observations were
carried out during September 2018, June and August 2019, with the
same instrument, covering the wavelength range from about 3,600
Å to 7,000 Å. In all cases, the slit was located through the centre of
the nebula crossing the central star position, and oriented E-W (P.A.
90◦). The slit length was always 13.3 arcsec in the plane of the sky.
The slit widths used were 100 𝜇 (1.3 arcsec) and 150 𝜇 (2 arcsec),
which provided spectral resolutions R = 𝜆/𝛿𝜆 of 20,000 and 18,000,
respectively, at 5,000 Å. Long and short exposure times were used
in order to detect the weak lines (in particular the heavy-element
recombination lines) with good signal to noise and to not saturate
the intense lines (exposure times of 1,800 s, 900 s, 600 s or less were
employed).

Wavelength calibration was performed with a Th-Ar lamp ob-
tained after each scientiﬁc observation. Standard stars from the list
by Hamuy et al. (1992) were observed each night for ﬂux calibration.
The slit width for standard stars was of 300 𝜇 (about 4 arcsec), in
order to include all the stellar ﬂux in the slit.

The log of observations is presented in Table 2. Observations

obtained since 2001 are included.

2.1 Data reduction

Spectroscopic data were reduced following the iraf1 standard rou-
tines: set of BIAS obtained each night was combined in a MASTER-
BIAS for BIAS subtraction. No ﬂat ﬁeld calibration was carried out.
Spectra of the same object, obtained during a night, with the same
exposure time, were combined in one, to improve the signal to noise.
1D spectra were extracted from the 2D echelle orders, they were
wavelength calibrated with the Th-Ar lamp obtained after each ob-
servation and corrected by eﬀects of atmospheric extinction, using
the curve for OAN-SPM sky given by Schuster & Parrao (2001). Fi-
nally the ﬂux calibration was carried out by using the standard stars
spectra.

Spectra in the zone around 𝜆4650 are presented in Fig. 1 showing
the quality of our data and the adequate spectral resolution to analyse
the lines in this zone, which is very important to separate the O ii and
N ii ORLs.

Fluxes were measured for all the available lines (which amount to
more than 100 in each case), by using iraf’s splot task. Their "Full
Width at Half Maximum", FWHM, were determined by applying
a Gaussian ﬁt in each case. If a line was double (two peaks) each
component was measured and a Gaussian ﬁt was applied to each one.
Such lines are marked with an asterisk in the intensity tables. FWHMs
were corrected by eﬀects of instrumental width (derived from the line
widths of comparison lamps) and thermal broadening (by adopting
an electron temperature according to each case), by assuming they
add in quadrature. Turbulent velocities were not considered (see §7).

where D is the spectral dispersion in Å/pix, 𝜎c is the mean standard
deviation per pixel of the continuum measured on each side of the
line, and Npix is the number of pixels covered by the line. For the
upcoming calculations, we adopted 2𝜎F values as more adequate to
represent the true line errors.

For each observed object, the logarithmic reddening correction,
c(H𝛽), was derived by using Cardelli et al. (1989) reddening law,
assuming a ratio of total to selective extinction RV = 3.1 and by using
the diﬀerent theoretical ratios H𝛼/H𝛽, H𝛾/H𝛽, H𝛿/H𝛽 and H𝜖/H𝛽
given by Storey & Hummer (1995) for the temperatures and densities
presented for each object in Table 3. H𝛼 line was saturated in the
spectra of Hu 2-1 and IC 4997, even in their low exposure-times
spectra, therefore the H𝛼/H𝛽 ratio was not used.

The observed and de-reddened ﬂuxes and the corrected line widths
for each object are presented in individual tables. Such tables can be

found in the on-line version only. An example of such tables is pre-
sented in Table 4 for Cn 3-1, where the emitting ion, the wavelength at
rest, the observed central wavelength, the observed and de-reddened
ﬂuxes, relative to H𝛽, and their uncertainties obtained by propagating
the errors associated to the line ﬂuxes through the normalization to
H𝛽 and the de-reddening correction, are presented together with the
line widths (FWHM) and the expansion velocities derived from the
line widths. The individual tables of all PNe are available as online
supplementary data.

3 PHYSICAL PARAMETERS OF NEBULAE

From the nebular lines, in particular from those collisionally excited
lines, physical conditions, such as electron densities and tempera-
tures, can be derived from some diagnostic line ratios. Densities
can be determined from the [S ii] 𝜆𝜆6731/6716, [O ii] 𝜆𝜆3729/3726,
[Cl iii] 𝜆𝜆5538/5518, [Fe iii] 𝜆𝜆4701/4659, and [Ar iv] 𝜆𝜆4711/4740
intensity ratios. Electron temperatures can be obtained from the
[N ii] 𝜆𝜆(6548+6584)/5755, [O iii] 𝜆𝜆(5007+4959)/4363, [Ar iv]
𝜆𝜆(7170+7263)/(4711+4740), [S ii] 𝜆𝜆(6716+6731)/(4068+4076)
and [O ii] 𝜆𝜆7325/3727 intensity ratios.

From the available diagnostic line ratios, all densities and temper-
atures were calculated with the code pyneb (Luridiana et al. 2015),
using the atomic data presented in the Appendix A, Table A1. pyneb
routine getCrossTemden was used to determine simultaneously the
temperature and density from the [N ii], [O iii], [S ii] and other di-
agnostic lines, by building diagnostic diagrams. The uncertainties in
the physical conditions and abundances were estimated using Monte
Carlo simulations, with 400 random points following a normal dis-
tribution around the observed intensity of the lines.

line identiﬁcation indicates that the line is emitted by the central star and not by the nebula.

3.1 Diagnostics diagrams

In Fig. 2 diagnostic diagrams for the analysed objects are presented.
These diagrams show the behaviour of diagnostic line ratios with
the electron density and temperature. Each line ratio is represented
by a broken or dotted line inside a colour band which shows the
1𝜎 rms error. Usually the electron densities and temperatures are
obtained from the zone where density- and temperature-diagnostics
intersect. The derived values for our objects are listed in Table 5.
These temperatures and densities will be used to determine ionic
abundances.

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

In order to derive correct temperatures, intensities of the auroral
lines [N ii] 𝜆5755 and [O iii] 𝜆4363 were corrected by eﬀects of
recombination using Liu et al. (2000) relations:

In this case we used the O+ and O+2 abundances determined from
CELs because we were not able to determine the abundance of O+
from recombination lines.

For Vy 1-2, we determined that the recombination contribution to
auroral line [O iii] 𝜆4363 intensity is of ∼1%. We also found the same
percentage using the recent relation proposed by Gómez-Llanos et al.
(2020) for this correction. The Te determined using the uncorrected
auroral line intensity is about ∼200 K higher than that determined
using the corrected line intensity, which lies within the error bars.
Therefore the correction does not produce a signiﬁcant eﬀect in
abundances determinations. In addition, García-Rojas et al. (2012)
were able to determined O+3 abundance directly from ORLs for the
highly ionized PNe of their sample, they found that the recombination
contribution is about ∼3% and the correction was negligible in the
temperature determinations.

can be derived from the He i lines, from the O ii lines, and from the
Balmer Jump as explained in the following.

3.2.1 Temperatures from the Balmer Jump

Temperature from the Balmer jump, Te(BJ), was only determined
for Cn 3-1, Hu 2-1 and IC 4997. We followed the procedure given by
Liu et al. (2001) for Te(BJ) determination:

Te (BJ) = 368 × (1 + 0.259 y+ + 3.409 y++)

(cid:19)−3/2

(5)

where y+ and y++ are the ionic abundances He+/H+ and He+2/H+, re-
spectively, BJ = Ic (3643) − Ic (3681) is the subtraction of intensities
of the continuum at those wavelengths, and I(H11) is the intensity
of H i 𝜆3770.

3.2.2 Temperatures from He i lines

Helium electronic temperatures, Te (He i), can be derived using
Zhang et al. (2005) methodology and the theoretical emissivities
for He i lines by Benjamin et al. (1999). We were able to deter-
mine temperatures from the line ratios 𝜆𝜆7281/6678, 𝜆𝜆7281/5875,
𝜆𝜆6678/5875, 𝜆𝜆6678/4471 and 𝜆𝜆5875/4471, by assuming a den-
sity of 104 cm−3, which agrees with the values derived from recom-
bination lines (see Table 7).

Zhang et al. (2005) and Otsuka et al. (2010) suggested that the most
accurate line ratio to determine Te (He i) is 𝜆𝜆7281/6678, because
these lines are among the most intense He i lines in the optical range,
their ratio is more sensitive to temperature but less sensitive to density
than other He i lines ratios, their recombination coeﬃcients are more
reliable than those for He i 𝜆4471 and 𝜆5876, and their ratio is less
aﬀected by the eﬀect of the interstellar extinction because of their
close wavelengths.

shadowed bands represent the 1 sigma rms error of each diagnostic. [Ar iv]b represents the line ratio 𝜆𝜆7170/4740.

Unfortunately, we could only measure the intensity of He i 𝜆7281
in two objects of our sample. In those objects where this line could not
be measured we adopted as Te (He i) the temperature derived from
the line ratio 𝜆𝜆6678/5875. We made this assumption because the
determined Te (He i) from 𝜆𝜆7281/6678 and 𝜆𝜆6678/5875 are very
close, within the uncertainties, for Vy 2-2 and IC 4997; this result
was also found by Otsuka et al. (2010) for the halo PN BoBn 1.

3.2.3 Temperatures and densities from O ii

It is known that the emissivities of recombination lines have a weak
dependence on electronic temperature (IORLs ∼ T−1
e ), nonetheless,
some lines of O ii emitted from states with diﬀerent orbital an-

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

gular momenta show some dependence on electronic temperature,
thus they can be used to estimate the temperature in the zone
where O ii lines are being emitted. This methodology, ﬁrst used
by Wesson et al. (2003) and then supported by some other au-
thors (Tsamis et al. 2004; Wesson et al. 2005; Fang & Liu 2013;
McNabb et al. 2013), uses the intensity ratio 𝜆𝜆4649/4089, lines
emitted in diﬀerent transitions, as temperature indicator. The re-
sults presented by these works show that Te (O ii) are very low
compared to Te from CELs, and follow a tendency of temperature
values Te ([O iii]) ≥ Te (BJ) ≥ Te (He i) ≥ Te (O ii). The main dis-
advantage of this method is that O ii𝜆4089 line is very faint and is
diﬃcult to measure. In this work, this O ii line could only be detected
in the spectra of Hu 2-1 and IC 4997, therefore only for these two
objects Te (O ii) could be determined using this method.

Another way to estimate Te (O ii) is by using the relationship pro-
posed by Peimbert et al. (2014). This method is based on the rate of
line intensities from both CELs and ORLs of O+2 and relates their
intensities with the electron temperature.

where I(V1) is the intensity of all the lines of the V1 multiplet of O ii
and I(F1) is the sum of the intensities of [O iii] 𝜆5007 and 𝜆4959. V1
multiplet is constituted by the lines 𝜆𝜆4638, 4642, 4649, 4651, 4661,
4673, 4676, 4696; and in LTE, the intensity of 𝜆4649 represents the
39.7% of the total multiplet intensity (Peimbert et al. 2014).

On the other side, the relative population of the ground-term ﬁne-
structure levels of some recombining ions, such as O ii and N ii,
vary with the electron density. From the intensity ratio of two ORLs
emitted in the same multiplet but from diﬀerent parent levels, one can
determine the electronic density (Fang & Liu 2013). These authors
show that line ratios O ii 𝜆𝜆4649/4661 and N ii 𝜆𝜆5679/5666 are
useful for the electronic density calculation. In our work we were

Ar+3, Ar+4, Fe+, Fe+2, and others, were determined from CELs
using the task get.IonAbundance from pyneb. For this we used the
de-reddened intensities of the lines listed in Table 8 as measured for
each nebula, and the adopted physical conditions for each nebular
zone as presented in Table 6. The results for all the objects are given
in Table 10. In the following the adopted zones for each case are

: represents a very uncertain result.

4.1 Cn 3-1

For this object we assumed a single zone of temperature and density
for all the ionic species. The adopted temperature is the mean value of
the temperatures derived from [N ii] and [O iii] line ratios, which are
equal within uncertainties. The density was determined as the mean
value of the computed densities from [S ii], [O ii] and [Cl iii] line
ratios. The density from [Fe iii] which is higher, was not considered
as the [Fe iii] lines are very faint and the derived density has large
uncertainty (see the 1𝜎 error band in Fig. 2). Thus, Cn 3-1 is assumed
to be a nebula with a single zone of temperature and density with
values Te ∼ 7, 900 K and ne ∼ 6, 600 cm−3.

4.2 Vy 2-2

At least two density zones were found in this object: a low den-
sity zone given by the [S ii] diagnostic with a value of ne ∼ 6, 200
cm−3; and a high density zone given by the [Cl iii] diagnostic with a
value ne ∼ 58, 200 cm−3, almost ten times larger than that of the low
density zone. Most probably there is a gradient of density increas-
ing inwards in this object. For the single ionized spices the density
from [S ii] ratio was used, while for the twice or more ionized spices
the density from [Cl iii] ratio was used. Regarding the electron tem-
perature, the [N ii] 𝜆𝜆(6548+6584)/5755 line ratio cannot be used
as temperature diagnostic due to the nebular lines are highly af-
fected by the inner high density, therefore these lines are undergoing
collisional de-excitation. Thus the [N ii] ratio is more indicative of
density, showing a value of about 105 cm−3 (see Fig. 2). The same
occurs with the temperature sensitive [Ar iv]𝜆𝜆7170/4740, which in
this case is indicating a density of about 106 cm−3 for the highest
ionized zone. Then the only available temperature diagnostics are the
[O iii] and [Ar iii] line ratios providing temperatures of about 12,800
K and 8,800 K, respectively. We decided to adopt the temperature
given by [Ar iii] for the low ionized species, and Te([O iii]) for the
high ionized species, as indicated in Table 6.

4.3 Hu 2-1

Densities were derived from [Cl iii], [Fe iii] and [Ar iv] diagnostics,
with values of 13,200 cm−3, 32,300 cm−3 and 48,700 cm−3, re-
spectively. The [O ii] and [S ii] density diagnostic ratios could not be

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

calculated with pyneb routines due to apparent problems with atomic
parameters. As it is shown in Fig. 2 the [S ii] line ratio is useless for
density determination. On the other hand, the [O ii] density, previ-
ously determined by Wesson et al. (2005) and Delgado-Inglada et al.
(2015), with a value of ∼7,000 cm−3 can be adopted. Thus Hu 2-1 is
a nebula with increasing density inwards.

For the single and double ionized species we adopted the density
given by the [Cl iii] and for the triple ionized species we adopted the
mean value of [Fe iii] and [Ar iv] densities, 47,100 cm−3. An electron
temperature of 10,200 K was determined from [N ii] lines, and a value
of 9,000 K from the [O iii] lines in the zone were both diagnostics
cross with [Ar iv] density diagnostic. Therefore we assumed a single
temperature for the whole nebula of 9,300 K, given by the mean
value of [N ii] and [O iii] temperatures.

4.4 Vy 1-2

In this case we adopted a single zone of density and temperature for
all species. Density is given by the mean value of [S ii], [O ii], and
[Ar iv] diagnostics and leads to a value of 5,400 cm−3. The slightly
larger density provided by the [Cl iii] lines was not considered, due
to the large uncertainty this value presents (see the wide 1𝜎 pink
error band in Fig. 2). The temperature was determined as the mean
value of [N ii] and [O iii] diagnostics which are very similar, leading
a value of 9,500 K.

4.5 IC 4997

This is a very complex object. Hyung et al. (1994), by analysing
optical and ultraviolet spectra, concluded that this PN contains at
least two important density zones: an outer zone with ne ∼ 104
cm−3 and an inner one with ne ∼ 106 − 107 cm−3. One important
detail about IC 4997 is the low [O iii] 𝜆𝜆4959/4363 line ratio which
shows a present value ∼ 2.05. This ratio has been decreasing with
time (Arkhipova et al. 2017). This low value is caused by the high
intensity of the auroral line 𝜆4363, augmented due to the large nebular
density (Menzel et al. 1941), and the low intensity of the nebular lines
which, as a consequence of the density larger than the critical value
for these lines, are undergoing collisional de-excitation. Therefore, it
is more appropriate to use the ratio of the nebular to auroral line as a

The results for O+2, C+2, and N+2 are presented in Table 9. The
O+2 values, compared to the ionic abundances from CELs, for the
same ion, allow us to derive the ADFs that are presented in Table 11.

density diagnostic instead of a temperature one (e.g., Kingsburgh &
Barlow 1994; Wesson et al. 2005). Thus this ratio leads to a value of
ne ∼ 1.81 × 106 cm−3.

The diagnostic diagram for this object (Fig. 2) is very complex.
Our interpretation is that there are, at least, two very diﬀerent density-
zones: one given by [Cl iii] and [Fe iii] line ratios, of about 31,700
cm−3, and a second one given by [O iii] and [Ar iii] line ratios which is
larger than about 1.81×106 cm−3. The [Ar iv] temperature diagnostic
line ratio, density-sensitive for this case, also indicates such a high
density. It was also possible to estimate the density given by [S ii]
lines but this diagnostic is in the limit of its validity range and the
interpretation is inconclusive, therefore it is not presented in the
diagram.

The [N ii] diagnostic ratio is the only one useful to estimate
the electron temperature. The intersection between this ratio and
the [Cl iii] density diagnostics results in a Te = 16, 200 K and
ne = 31, 700 cm−3. We adopted only the density value of [Cl iii]
because of the high dispersion of [Fe iii] density. When we assumed
this Te for the inner zones, we found ne ([O iii]) = 1.81 × 106 cm−3.
To determine ionic abundances, we decided to adopt a single tem-
perature zone and two diﬀerent density zones, given by [Cl iii] and
[O iii] ratios; they are shown in Table 6.

5 IONIC ABUNDANCES FROM ORLS: THE ADFS

Ionic abundances
from ORLs were computed using pyneb
get.IonAbundance with the previously determined temperatures and
densities (Te(He i), Te (O ii) or Te (BJ)) presented in Table 7. We
adopted the density derived from O ii 𝜆𝜆4661/4649 to determine
ionic abundances from recombination lines, except for Cn 3-1 where
it was not possible to estimate it and thus the density determined from
forbidden lines was adopted. Adopted temperatures were diﬀerent in
each case: for He i we adopted the derived Te(He i), for He ii in Vy 1-
2, the temperature determined from CELs, and for heavy elements,
Te (O ii) derived from Peimbert et al. (2014) expression. We decided
not to use Te (O ii) determined in Hu 2-1 and in IC 4997 from line
ratio 𝜆𝜆4649/4089 due to their very large uncertainties. For Cn 3-1
we used Te (BJ) to determine the abundances of all recombination
lines.

For each ion, diﬀerent line intensities were used: 𝜆5875 for He i,
𝜆4686 for He ii, 𝜆4267 for C ii, the intensities of V1 multiplet for O ii
and the intensities of multiplet V3 for N ii.

6 ABUNDANCE RESULTS

Total abundances from CELs were calculated from the measured
ionic abundances and using Ionization Correction Factors, ICFs, to
correct for the unseen ions. The ICFs employed and their expressions
are presented in Appendix B. Values for ICFs are listed in Table 10
together with the total abundances derived for each object.

In §8 we discuss the derived abundances, together with the kine-

matics, for each case.

7 THE KINEMATICS

The expansion velocity of the diﬀerent ions as a function of their
ionization potential has been analysed. Due to the ionization structure
of the nebulae, the ionization potential approximately represents the
distance of the ion to the central star. Fig. 3 shows these behaviours,
including the expansion velocities given by CELs (in blue) and by
ORLs (in red). Each dot represents the average value of the expansion
velocities of the observed lines of each ion, while the error bars
represent their mean standard deviation. When only a single line
was available, we adopted 2 km s−1 as the error value. Even when
we detected in our spectra some permitted lines of O i, Si ii, N iii
and O iii (Fig. 1), these lines are emitted by diﬀerent mechanisms
than recombination, such as ﬂuorescence and Bowen mechanism,
therefore those lines were not considered for the comparison between
CELs and ORLs.

Expansion velocities (Vexp) were determined from the FWHM
(Full Width at Half Maximum) for most of the lines which have
a single component. As said in §2.1 the instrumental and thermal
widths were discounted by assuming they add in quadrature. Turbu-
lent velocities are contributing also to the FWHM. Such velocities
have been analysed, among others, by Sabbadin et al. (2008); Gesicki
& Zĳlstra (2003); Gesicki et al. (2003). The latter authors concluded
that turbulence is signiﬁcant in PNe with [WC] central stars, but
has small values in other PNe. In this paper we are analysing non-
[WR] nebula, so turbulence might not be important and we have not
considered it in the expansion velocity calculation.

For the lines with a double-peaked proﬁle, a ﬁt of two deblending
Gaussian was applied, and the expansion velocities were determined
from the diﬀerence in velocity of both Gaussian.

Final expansion velocity of each ion was determined as the average
value of the expansion velocities of their observed CELs and ORLs.
Expansion velocities vs. ionization potentials are presented in Fig. 3.
In most cases we found that the kinematic behaviour of CELs is
typical of a plasma expanding in the vacuum. That is, the expan-
sion velocity increases with the distance to the central star, which
is normally predicted for a plasma expanding with velocities style
Hubble-ﬂow.

The analysis of Fig. 3 for the diﬀerent objects is presented in the
next section where a brief description of the objects is included, and
we discuss the abundance results and the kinematics obtained.

Radial velocities (Vrad) were determined for each observed line
by using Doppler eﬀect. The heliocentric correction was applied to
all the observed velocities and they were averaged to get a systemic
velocity for each object. These values and their standard deviations
are presented in Table 12.

8 DISCUSSION OF INDIVIDUAL RESULTS

8.1 Cn 3-1

This is a dense and compact PN, with a low ionization degree cor-
roborated by the low [O iii] 𝜆5007/H𝛽 ﬂux ratio of 0.28, therefore
almost all the oxygen is as O+. The nebula shows a low expansion
velocity of about 12 km s−1 from the [O iii] 𝜆5007 line (see Fig. 3),
and a heliocentric velocity of +29.62±6.37 km s−1 (Table 12).

Its distance from GAIA DR2 (7.65 kpc) and morphology from

Sahai et al. (2011) were already presented in Table 1.

Physical conditions and chemical abundances were derived pre-
viously for this nebula by Milingo et al. (2010) and Wesson et al.
(2005). Our values are very similar to those of both authors (see Table
13). The O abundance of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.60, together with the
heliocentric velocity, indicate that this is a disc nebula, located in the
solar vicinity. As a new result we have determined the Ne abundance
in this object, with a value log(Ne/O) ∼ −1.82, which results to be
very low in comparison with what is expected for normal PNe. There
are only a handful of PNe with such a low Ne/O abundance ratio.
The value reported for Cn 3-1 is similar to the value reported for the
halo PN H 4-1 (Otsuka & Tajitsu 2013), and for the PNe M 1-14,
IC 418 and Mz3 (Henry et al. 2010; Stanghellini & Haywood 2010).
No reliable explanation has been oﬀered so far for this phenomenon.
No ADF has been derived for this nebula previously. In this work
we could not derive an ADF either, because the O+2 abundance from
ORLs could not be determined due to the low ionization degree of
the nebula and due to the presence of stellar emission lines in the
wavelength range where the most important O ii lines (multiplet V1)
are found.

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

Regarding the kinematic behaviour, the blue points in Fig. 3 (up,
left) show that low ionization CELs from [S ii], [N ii], and [O ii]
present higher expansion velocities (from 18 to 21 km s−1) than
higher ionization CELs showing Vexp lower than 15 km s−1. This
behaviour is typical of an ionized plasma expanding in vacuum,
accelerating with the distance to the central star. The red dots in this
ﬁgure, showing the expansion velocities given by the ORLs, present
a similar behaviour to that of CELs (increasing velocity with distance
to the central star), except for N ii which shows a too large velocity for
its ionization potential. However, considering the large error bars, N ii
velocity coincides with ions of similar ionization potential. It should
be noticed that the O ii recombination lines and [O iii] collisionally
excited lines present a very similar expansion velocity. Therefore,
from these results there is no evidence of diﬀerent plasmas with
diﬀerent kinematics producing recombination lines and collisionally
excited lines in Cn 3-1.

8.2 Vy 2-2

This is a very compact, young and dense nebula. It shows a heliocen-
tric radial velocity of −63.91 ± 6.60 km s−1 (this work). The distance
from Frew et al. (2016), the morphology from Sahai et al. (2011), the
central star classiﬁcation and the previous reported ADFs, as well as
the huge FWZI at the base of H𝛼 were presented in Table 1.

The He ii 𝜆4686 recombination line was detected here showing a
wide proﬁle, therefore we consider it of stellar origin. Our diagnostic
diagram indicates an external zone with density of ne ([S ii]) = 6, 200
cm−3, and an inner zone of very high density with values ne([Cl iii])
of about 58,200 cm−3, while the [N ii] and the [Ar iv] temperature

sensitive diagnostic lines are indicating densities of about 105 −
106 cm−3. Therefore a steep density gradient exists in this nebula.
Electron temperatures could be derived from [O iii] and [Ar iii] CELs
providing values of Te([O iii]) = 12,800 K and Te([Ar iii]) = 8,800 K.
The high electron density prevents temperature determination from
the [N ii] 𝜆𝜆(6548+6584)/5755 lines ratio.

The abundances derived for this nebula indicate a low-abundance
object with 12 + log(O/H) = 8.14, while it presents about solar N,
Ne, S, Ar, and Cl abundances. The abundances found in the literature

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

by Perinotto et al. (2004) and Wesson et al. (2005) are in general
agreement with our values (Table 13). The low O abundance could
be due to depletion in dust grains, and since the S abundance is not
largely depleted, the dominant dust in Vy 2-2 might be the one of dual-
chemistry (DC) (García-Hernández & Górny 2014). We also found
a 12 + log(Fe/H) = 6.35+0.08
, which is lower than the solar value
−0.06
of 7.46, this can be also an indicator of depletion into dust grains
(García-Rojas et al. 2013, and references therein). The ADF(O+2)
derived in this work for O+2 is 4.30+1.00
, which is signiﬁcantly
−1.16
lower than the value 11.8 reported by Wesson et al. (2005).

The expansion velocities of the diﬀerent ions, derived from the
FWHM of lines, are presented in Fig. 3 (up,right). It is found that
CELs (blue dots) show a velocity ﬁeld increasing with the distance
from the central star, from about 19 km s−1 in the Ar+3 and Ne+2
zones to about 34 km s−1 or larger in the zone where O+, S+ and
Fe+2 reside, while ORLs present slightly lower Vexp, and no clear
gradient is found. The [O iii] lines show Vexp = 18 km s−1, while the
O ii lines show Vexp = 15 km s−1, which can be considered equal
within uncertainties.

is that the auroral and trans-auroral lines, shown in green in Fig.
3 (up, right) (e.g., [N ii]𝜆5755, [S ii]𝜆4068, [Ar iii]𝜆5192) present
lower expansion velocities than the nebular lines of the same ion
([N ii]𝜆𝜆6584, 6548, [S ii]𝜆𝜆6716, 6731, [Ar iii]𝜆7135). The diﬀer-
ences in velocity are larger than the uncertainties. Exceptions are the
lines of [Ar iv] which show the opposite, the auroral line 𝜆7170
presents slightly larger expansion velocity than the nebular line
𝜆4740, however both velocities are similar within uncertainties. A
possible explanation for this peculiar phenomenon is associated with
the very high density gradient in this nebula. It is known that auro-
ral lines usually have critical densities larger than the nebular lines
thus, in very high density nebulae the auroral lines can be emitted
in denser zones nearer the central star, where nebular lines are un-
dergoing collisional de-excitation. These inner zones are expanding
more slowly, in a Hubble-type ﬂow. A more detailed discussion on
this subject can be found in §8.6.

8.3 Hu 2-1

Chemical abundances for this object have been reported by Henry
et al. (2010), Perinotto et al. (2004), Wesson et al. (2005) and
Delgado-Inglada et al. (2015). Their results are in agreement with
the values reported here (Table 13). With a heliocentric velocity of
+23.62±5.67 km s−1 and 12 + log(O/H) = 8.46, Hu 2-1 is a regular
disc PN in the Galaxy. Wesson et al. (2005) reported an ADF(O+2) of
4.00, while we have found an ADF(O+2) of 1.85±1.05. A discussion
on this and other diﬀerences is presented in §9.

This and Vy 2-2 are the only objects in the sample in which we can
determine an iron total abundance using the ICF given by Rodríguez
& Rubin (2005), in the other objects their parameters are outside
the ICF validity range. We found a value of 12 + log(Fe/H) = 5.63,
which is much lower than the solar value of 12 + log(Fe/H) = 7.46
and, as for Vy 2-2, may be indicative of iron depletion into dust
(García-Rojas et al. 2013, and references therein), although O and S
do not appear very depleted.

The kinematic behaviour of CELs (blue points in Fig. 3 (mid-
dle,left)) is consistent with a Hubble-ﬂow type expansion, as Vexp
of [N ii], [S ii], [O ii] and [S iii] lines are larger than Vexp of higher
ionized species. Vexp of ORLs (red points) seem to show a ﬂatter
gradient. The velocity of O ii ORLs appears slightly higher than Vexp
of [O iii] CELs but equal within uncertainties.

8.4 Vy 1-2

This is a young PN with a complex morphology. Akras et al. (2015)
carried out a deep study of this object analysing its morphology,
kinematics and chemistry. According to these authors the central
star can be classiﬁed as a binary weak-emission-line star, 𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑠, as
it presents weak emission lines of C ii, C iv and O iii. Its eﬀective
temperature is in the range from 7.5×104 to 1.19×105 K. A possible
very late thermal pulse (VLTP) could have occurred in the central
star. From their low-resolution spectrum Akras et al. (2015) report a
solar abundance of O, slightly enhanced N and depleted C.

In this work we derived a heliocentric radial velocity of −82.40 ±
7.87 km s−1. Considering the distance reported by Frew et al. (2016)
(8.13 kpc) and by Akras et al. (2015) (9.7 kpc), and the heliocentric
velocity, this PN could be a halo object as a height of 3.3 − 3.9 kpc
above the galactic plane is derived from its galactic latitude b = +24◦.
However it shows an abundance 12 + log(O/H) = 8.84 (see Table
10) which is too large for a halo PN. This PN shows log(N/O)

abundance ratio of −0.38, log(Ne/O) = −0.76, log(S/O) = −1.82,
log(Ar/O) = −2.62, and log(Cl/O) = −3.44. Compared to average
values for disc PN abundances given by Kingsburgh & Barlow
(1994), Vy 1-2 abundances seem typical of a disc PN.

For this object, we did not detect any Ar+2 lines in our spectra. As
we determined the total abundance by using Kingsburgh & Barlow
(1994) ICF, which takes into account the ionic abundances of Ar+2,
Ar+3 and Ar+4, our total Ar/H abundance should be considered as a
lower limit, but closer to the real abundance; our value is consistent
with those derived by Wesson et al. (2005) and Akras et al. (2015).
which is lower than the
solar value by about a factor of ∼5.1; however, the ICF used to correct
the observed K+3 abundance, which is based on the ionic fraction of
Ar+3, requires a reliable determination of Ar/H abundance (Amayo
et al. 2020, and references therein). Therefore, our K/H value should
be also considered as a lower limit of the real abundance.

We found a 12+log(K/H) ratio of 4.45+0.16
−0.24

Wesson et al. (2005) reported an ADF(O+2) of 6.17 for this nebula.
which is

In this work we derived a value ADF(O+2) of 5.34+1.27
−1.08
consistent with their value.

The kinematics of Vy 1-2 is peculiar (Fig. 3 middle-left). Because
a central ring is the brightest structure (Akras et al. 2015), the lines
detected are mainly emitted in this zone. Expansion velocities pro-
vided by CELs show no gradient, actually the expansion velocities
of ions in the inner zone (He+2, Ar+3, Ne+2, O+2) are larger than the
velocities in the outer zone (N+, O+, S+), which is opposite of what is
expected in an expanding PN following a Hubble-law ﬂow. Only the
very inner ions (Ar+4, Ne+3) present low expansion velocities. Ve-
locities from ORLs show no systematic behaviour either, being some
times lower and sometimes higher than CELs velocities. Therefore
the inner zone seems to be accelerated compare to the outer zone.
In the literature few PNe present this peculiar kinematic behaviour;
considering the 14 objects studied by Peña et al. (2017) and the
40 objects analysed by Medina et al. (2006) only two of them, PN
BD+30 3639 and PN M 1-32, show a similar behaviour with Vexp of
[O iii] and other high ionized species larger the Vexp of [N ii], putting
in evidence high velocity gas in the central zone.

8.5 IC 4997

This is a very young and dense nebula, whose central star, classiﬁed
as 𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑠, has presented important changes and where the nebula is
also changing, heating with time. Kostyakova & Arkhipova (2009)
monitored the spectral evolution of this object for forty years. They
claimed that the electron density increased from 4 × 105 to 2 × 106
cm−3, and the electron temperature increased from 12,000 K to
14,000 K in the period 1972 to 1992. By considering the He i, [Ne iii],
and [O iii] lines it is found that the nebular ionization degree has
been growing with time. The central star seems to have increased its
eﬀective temperature from 37, 000 − 40, 000 K to 47,000 K in the
same period.

IC 4997 was studied by Arrieta & Torres-Peimbert (2003), who
measured a FWZI(H𝛼) equivalent to 5,100 km s−1 attributed to
Raman scattering. This was also suggested by Lee & Hyung (2000).
Feibelman et al. (1992) reported a secondary emission component,
displaced by −69 km s−1 from the peak of the broad main body of
H𝛼.

sibility that an important amount of these elements could be em-
bedded in dust grains. In this work we ﬁnd that S is also slightly
under-abundant which might indicate that also S could be embedded
in dust grains. Even when we found abundances of Fe+2 and K+3,
we could not use the previous ICF to determine total abundances
because they are outside their validity range.

The kinematics of IC 4997 is very complex. No gradient of CELs
or ORLs expansion velocities are found. The same as in the case
of Vy 2-2, the auroral and trans-auroral lines show lower expansion
than the nebular lines of the same ion. Again this phenomenon can
be attributed to the extreme density gradient in this nebula, which
has a density of about 30,000 cm−3 in the periphery and larger than
about 106 cm−3 in the inner zone. The auroral and trans-auroral lines
would be mainly produced in a higher density zone, where nebular
lines are undergoing collisional de-excitation due to they have lower
critical densities. A more detailed discussion on this subject can be
found in next subsection.

8.6 Nebular and auroral line kinematics in Vy 2-2 and IC 4997

As we mentioned in the previous subsections, in Vy 2-2 and IC 4997,
auroral (trans-auroral) and nebular lines of [S ii], [N ii], [O iii], [Ar iii]
and [Ar iv] present diﬀerent proﬁles and therefore diﬀerent kinematic
behaviour.

From very high-resolution spectra of PN NGC 6153, Barlow et al.
(2006) found that nebular and auroral lines of [O iii] 𝜆5007 and 𝜆4363
present diﬀerent velocity proﬁles. Since electronic temperature is
estimated from this ratio, the authors argued that large variations in
velocity of this ratio may be indicative of temperature ﬂuctuations
in the nebula. From photoionization models, Zhang (2008) explored
if the diﬀerences between auroral and nebular lines proﬁles can be
attributed to temperature or density variations in the plasma; he
argues that if these eﬀects are present in the nebulae, lines with
diﬀerent critical densities or excitation temperatures would show
diﬀerent proﬁles.

We attribute the velocity diﬀerences between auroral and nebular
lines in Vy 2-2 and IC 4997 to density variations and not to temper-
ature variations because in both nebulae we found a strong density
gradient increasing into their inner zones and the diﬀerences in ve-
locity are strongly marked in lines which are not useful to determine
electronic temperatures, such as [S ii] 𝜆𝜆(6716 + 6731)/4068 and
[N ii] 𝜆𝜆(6548 + 6584)/5755 which in the present circumstances are
sensitive to density. To analyse better this phenomenon, we compare
the critical densities and the expansion velocities of the auroral and
nebular lines for these two objects (Fig. 4) in order to ﬁnd a possible
correlation between both parameters.

For Vy 2-2 (Fig. 4, left) we found that auroral lines, which have
critical densities larger than 106 cm−3, are concentrated in a zone with
expansion velocities between 17 and 27 km s−1. Nebular lines of [S ii]
and [N ii] have larger expansion velocities than their auroral (trans-
auroral) lines, by about 20 and 12 km s−1 respectively. For the cases of
[Ar iii], [O iii] and [Ar iv] lines, the diﬀerences between auroral and
nebular lines are not so considerable: for [Ar iii] Vexp of the auroral
line is 6 km s−1 higher than the nebular value, however considering
the errors of Vexp of [Ar iii] lines the diﬀerence is just 2 km s−1; in the
case of [O iii], auroral and nebular lines show the same expansion
velocities of about 20 km s−1; while for [Ar iv], which shows the
opposite behaviour, the velocity of the auroral line is 6 km s−1 larger
than the nebular but considering the errors the diﬀerence is just of
2 km s−1. As we showed in Fig. 3, Vy 2-2 presents a Hubble-type
ﬂow for expansion velocities of ions, therefore we can consider that

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

auroral lines arises from inner zones of the nebula due to their lower
expansion velocities, these inner zones have higher density and the
emission of lines with low critical densities is suppressed there. This
eﬀect can be found in the nebular-auroral line ratios of [S ii], [N ii]
and [Ar iv], which are sensitive to density instead of temperature
(see Fig. 2); nonetheless the density in inner zones of the nebula
in not enough to overpass the critical densities of auroral lines of
[Ar iii] and [O iii] (ncrit > 107.38) and so the their line ratios are still
sensitive to temperature.

For IC 4997 (Fig. 4, right), there is clear discrepancy between the
velocities of the auroral and nebular lines of [S ii], [O iii] and [Ar iv],
the diﬀerences are of 11, 8 and 12 km s−1, respectively; as in the case
of Vy 2-2, [Ar iv] auroral line shows larger velocity than the nebular
one. Auroral and nebular lines of [N ii] and [Ar iii] show the same
expansion velocities (within the errors) of 27 and 25 km s−1. As in
Vy 2-2, for the ions which show important kinematic discrepancies
between auroral and nebular lines, their auroral-nebular ratio is not
sensitive to temperature and it is sensitive to density. Given the
kinematic complexity of the nebula, which does not follow a Hubble-
type ﬂow (Fig. 3), it is not possible to determine if the diﬀerences
of velocities of the lines are indicative of inner or outer zones of
the nebula, and they might be corresponding to complex structures
within the nebula.

9 DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

From high-resolution spectra, physical conditions (temperature and
density) and chemical abundances from CELs and ORLs have been
determined for the PNe Cn 3-1, Vy 2-2, Hu 2-1, Vy 1-2 and IC 4997,
for which our main goal was to derive the ADFs(O+2). The ﬁve
objects are young and dense, show density gradients growing towards
the inner zone and they have diﬀerent ionization degree and diﬀerent
morphology. Abundance determinations of He, O, N, Ne, Ar, S,
Cl have been obtained from CELs and our values are in general
agreement with values previously reported in the literature.

Three of the objects, Cn 3-1, Hu 2-1, and Vy 1-2, possess typical
abundances of disc PNe, comparable to the solar values. Vy 2-2 and
IC 4997 are low-abundance objects with 12+log(O/H) of about 8.2
or lower, which can be attributed to O depletion in dust grains or to
central stars formed in a low abundance medium. The large values of
Ne/O, Ar/O and S/O presented by both nebulae better indicate that
O might be depleted in dust grains. We also were able to determine
abundances of K/H for Vy 1-2 and Fe/H for Vy 2-2 and Hu 2-1.

From comparison of chemical abundances from CELs and ORLs,
ADFs(O+2) were calculated for Vy 2-2, Hu 2-1, Vy 1-2 and IC 4997,
obtaining values of 4.30, 1.85, 5.34 and 4.87 respectively. For Vy 2-2
and Hu 2-1, our values resulted to be smaller than values previously
reported in the literature. The diﬀerence between our values and the
previously reported can be attributed to the selection of multiplets
to determine the abundances for O ii. In our calculations we have
determined this abundance using the lines of multiplet V1 only,
which is the strongest among O ii multiplets; the lines from other
multiplets (e.g., V2, V5, V10, V19, V20 and 3p-4f transitions) are
much fainter than those from V1 and higher errors are expected
in O ii abundance. The Vy 2-2, Hu 2-1 and Vy 1-2 O ii abundances
determined by Wesson et al. (2005) include the contribution of other
multiplets. We found that our O ii V1 abundances for these objects
are similar to those derived by Wesson et al. (2005) for the same
multiplet. However, when these authors include the contribution of
the other multiplets, their O ii abundances become higher leading to
higher ADFs values. On the other side, Wesson et al. (2005) did not

report errors for the abundances of each multiplet and then it is not
possible to know if those diﬀerences are within their respective error
bars.

Considering the ADFs, the gas emitting ORLs is enriched by a
large factor, relative to the gas emitting CELs. An important work
to do is to estimate the amount of nebular mass contained in the
gas emitting CELs and the gas emitting ORLs, to determine the real
chemical abundances in the nebulae.

The temperatures derived from recombination lines of O ii are
lower than the values obtained from [O iii] CELs. We did not ﬁnd
evidence of the existence of cold H-deﬁcient He- and heavy elements-
rich small inclusions embedded in the nebulae and emitting most of
ORLs as proposed by Liu et al. (2000); Liu (2006, 2012), among
others, because according to their results, and also results from other
authors (e. g., Tsamis et al. 2004; Wesson et al. 2005), such inclusions
would have temperatures of about 1,000 K or even lower. We did not
ﬁnd such extremely low ORLs temperatures in the PNe of our sample,
for all cases we found that these temperatures are above 6,000 K.

The kinematics of the gas emitting CELs and ORLs was analysed
for each nebula to study the possibility of diﬀerent plasmas (with
diﬀerent physical conditions and spacial distribution) coexisting in
the nebula and emitting the diﬀerent lines. We compared in particular
the expansion velocities given by CELs and ORLs emitted by O+2.

The results indicate that such velocities are equal within uncertainties
in Cn 3-1, Vy 2-2, Hu 2-1 and Vy 1-2, therefore from the kinematics
point of view, there is no evidence for these lines being emitted in
diﬀerent zones of the nebula. But such velocities are very diﬀerent
in IC 4997, where we ﬁnd Vexp (𝜆4959) = 29.56 ± 2 km s−1 and
Vexp (𝜆4649) = 23.30 ± 2 km s−1, which might be implying that
ORLs are being emitted in a diﬀerent zone. According to Table 7,
the density and temperature given by O+2 recombination lines in
IC 4997 are 5,000 cm−3 and 7,700 K which are much lower than the
values derived from CELs.

As mentioned early for Vy 2-2 and IC 4997, we found the inter-
esting fact that, in some cases, nebular and auroral (or trans-auroral)
lines of the same ion (e.g., S+, N+, Ar+2, Ar+3, O+2) present diﬀer-
ent expansion velocities. Auroral and trans-auroral lines (marked in
green in Fig. 3) show, in general, lower Vexp which in the case of
Vy 2-2 (showing a Hubble velocity expansion law) might be indicat-
ing that auroral lines (sensitive to density and temperature) are being
emitted in a denser and inner zone than the nebular lines. This might
be a consequence of, in general, nebular lines have critical densi-
ties smaller than auroral lines, therefore nebular lines are undergoing
collisional de-excitation and are not emitted in dense zones. The phe-
nomenon is very complex in IC 4997 where the auroral lines of S+
and O+2 present lower Vexp than nebular lines, and the opposite oc-

curs in Ar+3. Anyway, being Vy 2-2 and IC 4997 the objects showing
the highest density diﬀerences between the inner and outer zones,
this phenomenon seems more related to density than to temperature
eﬀects.

IC 4997 is a very young PN, around a rapidly evolving hot post-
AGB central star. This interesting object has been showing stellar
and nebular evolution in short timescales, therefore it is necessary
to keep tracking IC 4997 and other similar objects in order to better
understand their behaviour and fast evolution towards the PN stage.
A similar work aiming to determine ADFs in PNe with diﬀerent
characteristics is being carried out for a number of objects. It will be
published in the future.
