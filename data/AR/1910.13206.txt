Abstract

We study the semileptonic decays of Bc meson to S-wave charmonium states in the frame-

work of relativistic independent quark model based on an average ﬂavor-independent con-

ﬁning potential U (r) in the scalar-vector harmonic form U (r) = 1

(a, V0) are the potential parameters.The form factors for B+

2 (1 + γ0)(ar2 + V0), where
c → ηc/ψe+νe transitions are

studied in the physical kinematic range. Our predicted branching ratios (BR) for transitions

to ground state charmonia are found comparatively large ∼ 10−2, compared to those for

transitions to radially excited 2S and 3S states. Like all other mpdel predictions, our pre-

dicted BR are obtained in the hierarchy: BR(B+

c → ηc/ψ(3S)) < BR(B+

c → ηc/ψ(2S))

< BR(B+

c → ηc/ψ(1S)). The longitudinal (ΓL) and transverse polarization (ΓT ) for

Bc → ψ(ns) decay modes are predicted in the small and large q2 - region as well as in

the whole physical region. The ratios for such transitions are obtained ΓL
ΓT

< 1 throughout

the kinematic range which means the B+

c meson transitions to vector meson charmonium

states take place predominantly in transverse polarization mode. The theoretical predic-

tions on these transitions could be tested in the on-going and forthcoming experiments at

LHCb.

INTRODUCTION

Ever since the discovery of Bc meson in Fermilab by the Collider Detector (CDF)

Collaborations [1] in 1998, the experimental probe to detect its family members in

their ground and excited states continues over last two decades. With the observation

of Bc meson at hadron collider at Tevatron [2, 3], a detailed study of Bc family

members is expected at the LHC, where the available energy is more and luminosity

± → J/ψe±νe and Bc

−0.16(stat.) ± 0.03(syst.) ps and its mass: M = 6.40 ± 0.39 ± 0.13 GeV have

is much higher. The lifetime of Bc has been measured [4–7] using decay channels:
± → J/ψπ±. A more precise measurement of Bc-lifetime:

Bc
τBc = 0.51+0.18
been obtained [8] using the decay mode Bc → J/ψµνµX, where X denotes any possible
c → J/ψπ+ relative
c → J/ψµ+νµ has been measured by LHCb Collaborations yielding [9]:

BR(Bc→J/ψµ+νµ) = 0.0469 ± 0.0028(stat) ± 0.0046(syst)

the channel B±

Recently, ATLAS Collaboration at LHC has detected excited Bc state [10] through
c (1S)π+π− by using 4.9 f b−1 of 7 TeV and 19.2 f b−1 of
8 TeV pp collision data which yielded Bc(2S) meson mass ∼ 6842 ± 4 ± 5 MeV.
Although masses of the ground and ﬁrst excited state of Bc with J P = 0− have been

c (2S) → B±

measured, it has not yet been possible to detect its higher excited states and even

the ground state of B∗

c . Hopefully with the available energy and higher luminosity at
LHC and at Z0 factory, the event accumulation rate for these undetected states can
be enhanced in near future providing scope for detailed studies of Bc and B∗

c counter-
part.The recent observed data and possibility of high statistics Bc events expected in

upcoming experiments provide necessary motivation to investigate the semileptonic

Bc meson decays to charmonium states which are easier to identify in the experiment.

The Bc meson has aroused a great deal of theoretical interest due to its outstand-

ing features. It is the lowest bound state of two heavy constituent quarks (charm and
bottom) with open (explicit) ﬂavor unlike the symmetric heavy quarkonium (b¯b, c¯c)
states. The charmonium (c¯c) and bottomonium (b¯b) with hidden ﬂavors decay

via strong and electromagnetic interactions whereas Bc meson with open ﬂavors

2

decay only via weak interaction since it lies below the B ¯D threshold. Therefore

it has comparatively long lifetime and very rich weak decay channels with sizable

branching ratios. Thus Bc-meson provides a unique window into heavy quark

dynamics and give scope for independent test of quantum chromodynamics. The

study of semileptonic decays, in particular, is signiﬁcant because it not only helps

in extracting accurate values of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Masakawa (CKM) matrix

element but also helps in separating the eﬀect of strong interaction from that of weak

interaction into a set of lorentz invariant form factors. The analysis of semileptonic

decays is therefore reduced essentially to the calculation of relevant weak form factors.

Semileptonic Bc decays have been widely studied in the literature. Although

it is not possible to cite them all, a few noteworthy ones are: potential models

[11–18], non-relativistic qurak models [19, 20], relativistic quark models [21–25],

instantaneous non-relativistic approach to BS equation [26], relativistic quark model

on BS approach [27], non-relativistic QCD [20, 28, 30], light-cone QCD sum rule

[31–33], covariant light-front model [34],

light-front quark model constrained by

the variational principle for QCD motivated eﬀective Hamiltonian [35], light-front

quark model [36], QCD potential model[37–39], perturbative QCD approach [40–44],

constituent quark model [45–49] and Isgur, Scora, Grinstein and Wise (ISGW) model

[50]. In this context one would also like to refer to review paper [51] and references

there in. In this paper we would like to extend the applicability of our relativistic

independent quark (RIQ) model [52–59] which has already been tested in describing

wide ranging hadronic phenomena including the static properties of hadrons [52] and

various decays such as radiative, weak radiative, rare radiative [53], leptonic, weak

leptonic, radiative leptonic [54], semileptonic [55, 56] and nonleptonic [57] decays of

hadrons in the light and heavy ﬂavor sector. In our previous work on semileptonic

Bc meson decays, we consider the participating mesons in their respective ground

state only. In view of observed Bc(2S) states and possible detection of higher Bc(nS)

states (n > 2) as well as B∗

c (1S) state at LHC and Z0 factory in near future, it
is worthwhile to predict energetically allowed semileptonic Bc decays to excited

charmonium states too. In fact a number of theoretical approaches in this direction

3

have already appeared in the literature. Being inspired by our recent prediction of

magnetic dipole [58] and electromagnetic [59] transitions of Bc and B∗

c mesons in
their ground and possible excited states we extend our previous work [56] to analyze

B+

c (nS) → ηc(nS)/ψ(nS)e+νe decays, where the radial quantum numbers n=1,2,3.
We don’t consider here the decay modes with higher 4S charmonia as their properties

are not yet understood well.

Here we would like to note few points that motivate us to undertake this exercise:

(1) The relevant form factors representing the weak decay amplitudes are expected to

have their q2 dependence (where q2 denotes the four momentum transfer squared) over

entire kinematic range. In some of the theoretical approaches cited above the weak

decay form factors and their q2 dependence are determined ﬁrst with an end point

normalization at either q2 =0 or q2 = q2

max and then using some phenomenological
monopole/dipole/gaussian ansatz they are extrapolated to the whole physical region.

In order to avoid possible uncertainties in the calculation we shall not resort to any

such phenomenological ansatz and instead study the q2 dependence of relevant form

factors in the allowed kinematic range: 0 ≤ q2 ≤ (M − m)2, where M and m refer

to mass of the parent and daughter meson, respectively. (2) In our previous analysis

[55, 56] two weak form factors a+ and a− corresponding to 0− → 1− semileptonic

transition are found to be equal under a simplifying assumption. On closure scrutiny

it is realized that, a+ is not strictly equals to a−. It is not necessary to invoke any

kind of simplifying assumption but nonetheless get model expressions seperately for

a+ and a−. (3) In this work we intend to predict the BR for decay channels involving

the ground as well as excited charmonia in the ﬁnal state and compare our results with

other model predictions. (4) Finally, we shall update some input hadronic parameters

according to Particle Data Group 2018 [60] in our calculation.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section-II we provide the general formalism

and kinematics of Bc meson semileptonic decays. Section-III brieﬂy describes the

framework of RIQ model and extraction of model expression for the weak form factors.

In Section-IV we provide our numerical results and discussion. Section-V encompasses

our summary and conclusion.

where, X denotes ηc or J/ψ, GF is the eﬀective Fermi-coupling constant, Vbc is the
CKM parameter, Lµ and Hµ, respectively are the leptonic and hadronic amplitudes

expressed as:

Lµ = ¯ue((cid:126)p1, δ1)γµ(1 − γ5)vνe((cid:126)p2 , δ2),

Hµ = < X((cid:126)k, SX) | J h

Here J h

µ = Vµ − Aµ is the vector-axial vector current. We take here (M, m) to be
the mass, (p, k) the four momentum and (SBc, SX) the spin projection of parent and

daughter meson, respectively. q = (p − k) = (p1 + p2) is four momentum transfer

where (p1, p2) are four momenta of the lepton pair. We introduce here a pair of

x = (p1.p2/M 2) for sake of convenience to describe kinematics of the decay process.

In the vanishing lepton mass limit, kinematically allowed range of y is

We also consider two frames of reference (i) parent meson rest frame and (ii) the eνe

center-of-mass frame. The co-ordinate system chosen here is such that the daughter
meson momentum (cid:126)k is along the negative Z-axis with the charged lepton momentum

(cid:126)p1 subtending an angle θe to Z-axis [Fig. 1(a)] in the eνe center-of-mass frame.

The Y-axis is oriented perpendicular to the plane containing ﬁnal particles’ momenta.

The physical quantities of interest associated with the ﬁnal state particles are their

energy and momentum, which can be calculated in both frames considered here. In

the eνe center-of-mass frame they are

The hardronic amplitudes are covariantly expanded in terms of lorentz invariant form

factors. For the transition of type (0− → 0−), the expansion is

< X(k) | Vµ(0) | Bc(p) >= f+(q2)(p + k)µ + f−(q2)(p − k)µ

(12)

For (0− → 1−) type transitions they are

< X(k, (cid:15)∗) | Vµ(0) | Bc(p) >= ig(q2) ∈µνρσ (cid:15)∗ν(p + k)ρ(p − k)σ

Here (cid:15)∗ ≡ ((cid:15)∗

0,(cid:126)(cid:15) ∗) with (cid:15)∗.k = 0, represents the vector meson polarization.

The diﬀerential decay rate is written in the generic form

in the eνe center-of-mass frame. Since its timelike component L00 is zero in the

vanishing lepton mass limit, the non-vanishing contribution to M comes from the

product LijHij only. Then integrating Lij over the lepton phase space, one gets, in

the eνe center-of-mass frame:

(cid:90) (cid:90) d3(cid:126)p1

It is worthwhile to note here that the hadronic amplitude ‘hi’ can be expressed, in

this frame, in a simple and convenient form as the terms involving the form factors
f−(q2) and a−(q2) do not contribute to (cid:126)h pertaining to transitions of the type (0− →
0−) and (0− → 1−), respectively. For (0− → 0−) type transitions one obtains hi (12)
in terms of a single form factor f+(q2) as

(cid:126)h = ((cid:126)p + (cid:126)k)f+(q2)

(21)

Similarly for transitions of type (0− → 1−), we obtain (cid:126)h from Eq.(13) and (14) as

(cid:126)h = 2i

√

yM g(q2)((cid:126)(cid:15) ∗ × (cid:126)k) − f (q2)(cid:126)(cid:15) ∗ − 2((cid:15)∗.p)a+(q2)(cid:126)k

(22)

For the calculation of physical quantities, it is more convenient to use helicity am-

plitudes, which are linearly related to the invariant form factors [54, 55, 61]. We
therefore, expand (cid:126)h in terms of helicity basis (eﬀectively of the virtual W) as

with

(cid:126)h = H+ˆe+ + H−ˆe− + H0ˆe0

ˆe± =

1
√
2

(∓ˆx − iˆy); ˆe0 = ˆz

(23)

(24)

The polarization vector ˆ(cid:15)∗ with the polar and azimuthal angle (θ∗, φ∗) in the vector

meson helicity frame [Fig. 1(b)] can be lorentz-transformed to the (eνe) center-of-mass

frame to be obtained in the form

sin θ∗eiφ∗ ˆe+ −

(25)

Then expanding hi in terms of helicity basis (23, 24) and using the Lorentz trans-
formed form of ˆ(cid:15)(cid:63) (25), one can obtain the helicity amplitudes H± and H0 from Eq.

(22) as

H± = ∓

e±iφ∗ ¯H±

sinθ∗
√
2
H0 = cosθ∗ ¯H0

(26)

(27)

where ¯H± and ¯H0 are reduced helicity amplitudes. For (0− → 1−)-type semileptonic
transitions, these reduced helicity amplitudes are obtained in terms of invariant form

factors f, g and a+ as

¯H± = [ f (q2) ∓ 2M Kg(q2) ],

(29)

Now Hii = hih†
i in Eq. (20) can be expressed in terms of reduced helicity amplitudes
(28, 29). Then integration over the polar and azimuthal angles (θ∗, φ∗) and then sum

over the daughter meson (vector) polarization yield an invariant expression for the

diﬀerential decay rate. Once obtained in an invariant form it is then convenient to

cast in any frame (here the parent meson rest frame) so as to get the ﬁnal expression

of the diﬀerential decay rate as:

(30)

Here the contribution of | ¯H0 |2 term to the diﬀerential decay rate (30) refers to the
longitudinal mode and that of the combined term [ | ¯H+ |2 + | ¯H− |2 ] refers to
the transverse polarization mode for the semileptonic transitions of the type (0− →

1−). However, in case of (0− → 0−) type transitions, one can realize corresponding

expressions by appropriately identifying

III. TRANSITION MATRIX ELEMENT AND WEAK FORM FACTORS

The decay process physically occurs between the momentum eigenstates of partic-

ipating mesons. Therefore in a ﬁeld theoretic description they need to be represented

by their appropriate momentum wave packets reﬂecting the momentum and spin

distribution between constituent quark and antiquark inside the respective meson

core. In the RIQ model, the appropriate wave packet representing the meson state

|Bc((cid:126)p, SBc) > is consideed at deﬁnite momentum (cid:126)p and spin state SBc as [52–59]

|Bc((cid:126)p, SBc) >= ˆΛ((cid:126)p, SBc)|((cid:126)pb, λb); ((cid:126)pc, λc) >

(33)

where, |((cid:126)pb, λb); ((cid:126)pc, λc) >= ˆb†

†
momentum and spin as ((cid:126)pb, λb) and ((cid:126)pc, λc). Here ˆb†

tively the quark and antiquark creation operators. ˆΛ((cid:126)p, SBc) represents an integral
operator:

(34)

√

Here

3 is the eﬀective color factor, ζ Bc(λb, λc) stands for SU-(6) spin ﬂavor coeﬃ-

cients for the Bc meson. N ((cid:126)p) is the meson-state normalization which is realized from
< Bc((cid:126)p) | Bc((cid:126)p (cid:48)) >= δ(3)((cid:126)p − (cid:126)p (cid:48)) in an integral form

N ((cid:126)p) =

(35)

Finally, GBc((cid:126)pb, (cid:126)p − (cid:126)pb) is the eﬀective momentum proﬁle function for the quark-

antiquark pair. In terms of individual momentum probability amplitudes Gb((cid:126)pb) and

Gc((cid:126)pc) of the constituent quark b and c, respectively, GBc((cid:126)pb, (cid:126)p − (cid:126)pb) is taken in this

model in the form:

GBc((cid:126)pb, (cid:126)pc) =

(cid:113)

Gb((cid:126)pb) ˜Gc((cid:126)pc)

(36)

in a straight forward extension of the ansatz of Margolis and Mendel in their bag

model analysis [62]. A brief account of the model framework and quark orbitals

derivable in the RIQ model along with those of the corresponding momentum prob-

ability amplitudes are given in the Appendix. In the wave packet representation of

meson bound state |Bc((cid:126)p, SBc) >, the bound state character is infact embedded in the

eﬀective momentum distribution function GBc((cid:126)pb, (cid:126)pc) . Any residual internal dynamics

responsible for decay process can therefore be described at the level of otherwise free

quark and antiquark using appropriate Feynman diagram shown in Fig. 2. The total

contribution from the Feynman diagram provides the constituent level S-matrix ele-

ment Sbc

f i which when operated by the baglike operator gives the meson level eﬀective

S-matrix element SBc

B. Weak decay form factors

In order to extract model expression of weak decay form factors, the covariant

exapansion of hadronic decay amplitudes [12–14] are compared with corresponding

model expression . For this the spin matrix element are simpliﬁed as follows. For

0− → 0− transitions, the axial vector current does not contribute. The non-vanishing

vector current parts are obtained as:

< SX((cid:126)k)|V0|SBc(0) >=

(cid:113)

(E(cid:126)pb+(cid:126)k + mc)(E(cid:126)pb + mb) + (cid:126)pb

dimensionless forms as cited in the literature to treat all in the same footing as

F1(q2) = f+(q2)

V (q2) = (MBc + MX)g(q2)

A1(q2) = (MBc + MX)−1f (q2)

A2(q2) = −(MBc + MX)a+(q2)

(57)

The q2- dependence of the weak form factors and prediction of the branching ratios

for semileptonic Bc-decays to S-wave charmonium states can then be obtained using

relevant hadronic quantities and RIQ-model parameters, as described in the next

section.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

For numerical calculation, we take the model parameters (a,V0), quark masses

mq and quark binding energies Eq which have already been ﬁxed from hadron spec-

troscopy by ﬁtting the data of heavy ﬂavored mesons, and used earlier to describe

wide ranging hadronic phenomena: [52–59]

(a, V0) ≡ (0.017166 GeV 3, −0.1375 GeV )

(mb, mc, Eb, Ec) ≡ (4.77659, 1.49276, 4.76633, 1.57951) GeV

(58)

To obtain the binding energy of constitute quarks (b,c) in radially excited (2S and

3S) meson states, we solve the cubic equations that represent the corresponding in-

dependent quark bound state condition. Accordingly we take [58, 59]

(Eb; Ec) = (5.05366; 1.97016)GeV

(Eb; Ec) = (5.21703; 2.22479)GeV

(59)

The masses of participating mesons in their S-wave ground and radially excited states

are taken in GeV as[59] MBc=6.2749, Mηc=2.9839, Mηc(2S)=3.6392, Mηc(3S)=3.8381,

MJ/ψ=3.0968, Mψ(2S)=3.6860, Mψ(3S)=4.1104. For CKM parameter Vbc and Bc meson

lifetime τBc, we use their central values from Particle Data Group [60] as Vbc=0.0422
and τBc = 0.51+0.18
−0.16(stat.) ± 0.03(syst.) ps. Before calculating the weak form factors
and their q2- dependence in the allowed kinematic range with the input parameters

[58, 59], it is interesting to study the behavior of radial quark momentum distribution

amplitude function related to Bc meson state together with those of the ﬁnal S-wave

charmonium states. The shape of the behavior of momentum distribution amplitude

is shown in Fig.3. One can see that the overlap region between the momentum dis-

tribution amplitude function for the initial Bc meson state and ﬁnal charmonium 1S

state is maximum, where as it is less for Bc decay mode to 2S and least for the Bc

decay to 3S charmonium state. The lorentz invariant weak form factors representing

the decay amplitudes are in fact calculated from the overlapping integrals of partic-

ipating hadron wave functions. It is evident therefore that the contribution of weak

form factors to the decay width/branching fractions should be obtained in the de-

creasing order of magnitude as one considers various semileptonic Bc decays to S-wave

15

charmonium states from 1S to higher 2S and 3S states. Our predicted q2- dependence

of weak form factors for six decay modes: in their physical kinematic range is shown

in Fig 4. We ﬁnd that transitions B+

c → ηc, (J/ψ)e+νe have a relatively strong q2-
dependence as relevant form factors become larger with increasing q2. This behavior,

however is not universal. For example, for transition, B+

c → ηc(2S), ψ(2S)e+νe and
c → ηc(3S), ψ(3S)e+νe some of the form factors decreases with increasing q2. Sim-
ilar predictions have been made in other model calculations based on perturbative

B+

QCD approach [40] light-front quark model [36] and ISGW2 quark model [34]. This is

attributed to the nodal structure in the momentum distribution amplitude functions

corresponding to Bc decay to diﬀerent S- wave charmonium states and the momentum

transfer involved in diﬀerent decay modes.

as an outcome of heavy quark eﬀective theory (HQET). From the predicted q2-

dependence (Fig.4), it is evident that the weak form factors do not simultaneously

satisfy HQS relation. This corroborates to the well known fact that the HQS is not

strictly applicable to the case of mesons with two heavy quarks.

For Bc → ηc/(J/ψ)eνe decays, our predictions are in good agreement with those

of non-relativistic quark model [20], relativistic quark model [23–25], Bethe-Salpeter

quark model [27], light-cone QCD sum rule [33] and QCD potential model [37]. For

Bc → ηc(2S)/ψ(2S)eνe decays our results are in overall agreement with the results

of perturbative QCD approach [40]. Bc → ηc(3S)/ψ(3s)eνe transitions have been

analyzed by a few theoretical approaches [23, 24, 30, 40]. The order of magnitude

of predicted BR in these decay modes vary widely from one model to other. While

the relativistic quark model predictions [23, 24] are typically smaller,those of the

light-front QCD sum rule [33] and perturbative QCD approach [40] are 2 order of

magnitude higher. Our predictions in this sector, although found over estimated,

compared to that of [25] are in overall agreement with [40]. Since data in this sector

are scant, the results of all these approaches can only be discriminated in future

LHC experiments. As expected, our predicted BR are obtained in the following

hierarchy: BR(B+

c → ηc, J/ψ(1S)).
This is due to the tighter phase space and weaker q2- dependence of weak form

We ﬁnd the polarization ratios ΓL
ΓT

< 1 in region-I, region-II and whole physical

region which means that semileptonic Bc decays to S-wave charmonium states take

place predominantly in transverse mode throughout the region. This is because in

our model calculation, the form factor V(q2) increases throughout with increase in

q2 which enhances the transverse polarization contribution in large q2 region. On

the other hand, form factor A2(q2) which provides dominant contribution to ΓL as
compared to A1(q2) is found suppressed mostly in large q2 region giving minimal

contribution to ΓL.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this paper we analyze the semileptonic Bc decays to S-wave charmonium states

in the framework of relativistic independent quark model based on conﬁning poten-

tial in equally mixed scalar-vector harmonic form. The weak form factors as overlap

integrals of the participating mesons’ wave functions, derived from the RIQ model

dynamics, are calculated explicitly in the entire kinematic range. We predict the

branching ratios (BR), longitudinal to transverse polarization ratios ΓL
ΓT

for these de-

cays in general agreement with predictions of other theoretical approaches. It is found

the predicted BR’s for Bc decays to the ground state charmonium is comparatively

large ∼ 10−2 while those for decays to higher excited charmonium states are relatively

small owing to the phase space suppression and weaker q2 dependence of the form

factors. The partial BR and transverse and longitudinal polarizations are investi-
gated separately for Bc → ψ(nS)eνe decays from which we ﬁnd that the ratios ΓL
ΓT
< 1 in the lower and higher q2 region as well as in the whole physical region. This

means the semileptonic Bc decays to S-wave charmonium vector states take place in

predominantly transverse mode. These theoretical predictions could be tested in the

ongoing and forthcoming experiments. With the possible data on Bc decays expected

from the LHC experiments one can extract the accurate value of CKM parameter

which would provide an important consistency check for the standard model.

PROBABILITY AMPLITUDES

In RIQ model a meson is picturised as a color-singlet assembly of a quark and

potential in the form: U (r) = 1

an antiquark independently conﬁned by an eﬀective and average ﬂavor independent
2(1 + γ0)(ar2 + V0) where (a, V0) are the potential
parameters. It is believed that the zeroth order quark dynamics generated by the

phenomological conﬁning potential U (r) taken in equally mixed scalar-vector har-

monic form can provide adequate tree level description of the decay process being

analyzed in this work. With the interaction potential U (r) put into the zeroth order

quark lagrangian density, the ensuing Dirac equation admits static solution of positive

The solution of the cubic equation provides the zeroth order binding energies of the

conﬁned quark and antiquark for all possible eigenmodes.

In the relativistic independent particle picture of this model, the constituent quark

and antiquark are thought to move independently inside the Bc-meson bound state

with momentum (cid:126)pb and (cid:126)pc, respectively. Their individual momentum probability
