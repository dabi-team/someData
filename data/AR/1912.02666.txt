ABSTRACT.  Oligothiophenes  are  -conjugated  semiconducting  and  fluorescent  molecules 
whose self-assembly properties are widely investigated for application in organic electronics, op-
toelectronics, biophotonics and sensing. We report here an approach to the preparation of crystal-
line  oligothiophene  nano/micro-fibers  based  on  the  use  of  a  ‘sulfur  overrich’  quaterthiophene 
building block, -T4S4-, containing in its covalent network all the information needed to promote 
the directional, stacking driven, self-assembly of Ar-T4S4-Ar oligomers into fibers with hi-
erarchical supramolecular arrangement from nano- to microscale. We show that when Ar varies 
from unsubstituted thiophene to thiophene substituted with electron withdrawing groups, a wide 
redistribution  of  the  molecular  electronic  charge  takes  place  without  substantially  affecting  the 
aggregation modalities of the oligomer. In this way a structurally comparable series of fibers is 
obtained having progressively varying optical properties, redox potentials, photoconductivity and 
type of prevailing  charge carriers (from  p- to n-type).  A thorough characterization of  the fibers 
based on SEM, CD, CV, X-ray diffraction, UV-vis and PL spectroscopies, photoconductivity and 
KPFM measurements is reported. With the aid of DFT calculations, combined with X-ray data, a 
model  accounting  for  the  growth  of  the  fibers  from  molecular  to  nano-  and  microscale  is  pro-
posed. We believe that the simple strategy outlined in this study allows to establish a straightfor-
ward correlation between the molecular structure of the components and the functional properties 
of the corresponding self-assembled nano/micro-fibers.

INTRODUCTION  

Investigations  aimed  to  the  design  and  synthesis  of  molecules  capable  to  self-assemble  into 

functional  supramolecular  structures  by  means  of  multiple  non  covalent  interactions  are  at  the 

forefront  of  nanoscience  and  nanotechnology.1-10  Researches  concern  both  equilibrium  and 

dynamic, i.e. out-of-equilibrium, self-assembling systems, the latter being of outmost importance 

to understand the biological world.1b,c Since the properties of the supramolecular structures do not 

necessarily correspond to those of the single components, a crucial aspect of the investigations on 

molecular self-assembly  is  the search  for  building blocks storing sufficient  information  in  their 

covalent  framework  to  promote  spontaneous  organization  into  well  defined  supramolecular 

structures  via  precise  non-bonded  interactions  (specific  non  covalent  interactional  algorithms 

according  to  J.M.  Lehn’s  definition11).  The  identification  of  such  molecular  building  blocks 

would  enable  the  easy  planning  of  supramolecular  structures  with  programmed  properties  and 

function.  Among  supramolecular  systems  of  major  current  interest  are  organic  semiconducting 

fibers  hierarchically  organised  across  different  length  scales  for  application  in  photovoltaics, 

supramolecular electronics and nanophotonics.2-7 Several organic self-assembled  supramolecular 

functional  fibers  have  been  synthesized  so  far  using  various  chemical  strategies,  including  the 

preparation  of  nanochains  made  of  organic  nanoparticles.3  Most  of  these  self-assembly  studies 

concern p-type semiconducting  components (hole charge carriers) while  n-type semiconducting 

components  (electron  carriers)  have  been  much  less  explored.  Recently,  perylene  imide 

molecules  have  been  investigated  for  the  formation  of  supramolecular  n-type  fibers  and  the 

relationship between molecular structure, noncovalent interactions, self-assembly conditions and 

fibers'  morphology  discussed  in  view  of  applications  in  optoelectronics.6  Nevertheless  further 

progress  is  required  in  design,  synthesis,  structural  analysis  and  optical  and  electrical 

characterization  of  functional  supramolecular  fibers,  while  work-up  simplicity,  reproducibility 

and chemical stability are needed for any type of application. Tailoring the electronic properties 

of  self-assembling supramolecular fibers while mantaining control over their crystalline structure 

and  morphological  habit  has  not  yet  been  achieved.  Moreover,  contrary  to  small  molecules  or 

oligomers  and  polymers  obtained  by  means  of  covalent  synthesis,  no  full  control  on 

HOMO/LUMO energy gaps, redox properties and optical features of  the fibers has been realized. 

Furthermore, the relevant properties of supramolecular fibers are generally optimized employing 

2 

 
 
different  molecular  structures  which  self-organise  in  different  manners  making  difficult  to 

compare 

their  performance.  Among 

the  components  employed  for 

the  formation  of 

supramolecular structures are thiophene derivatives.12 Nanostructured crystalline fibers obtained 

by  self-assembly  of  poly(3-hexylthiophene)13  and  of  thiophene  oligomers  bearing  terminal 

groups capable to form hydrogen bonds14 have been reported. The formation of supramolecular 

fluorescent and p-type semiconducting fibers has also been reported by our group, by employing 

‘sulfur  overrich’  octithiophenes  (having  an  extra  sulfur  per  ring  via  -functionalization  with 

thioalkyl chains) as a strategy to promote anisotropic growth through directional S···S intra- and 

intermolecular non-bonded interactions.15a,b On these grounds it results clearly appealing to target 

a new class of oligothiophenes capable to self-assemble into functional supramolecular fibers and 

simultaneously  to  undergo  wide  electronic  changes  in  charge  distribution  without  substantially 

modifying the aggregation modalities. Such challenging perspective would enable unprecedented 

rational  tuning  of  various  properties  within  a  set  of  comparable  systems,  in  particular  to  pass 

from  p-type  to  n-type  charge  transport  characteristics.  Here  we  report  that  3,3’,4’’,4’’’-

tetrakis(hexylthio)-2,2’:5’,2’’:5’’,2’’’:5’’’,2’’’’-quaterthiophene (-T4S4-, Scheme 1) is a building 

block capable to promote the  stacking driven formation of functional crystalline fibers from 

Ar-T4S4-Ar oligothiophenes (compounds 1-5) via solvent-vapour diffusion at room temperature.  

Chart 1. Molecular structure of compounds 1-5. 

The addition of different terminal Ar groups to the -T4S4- building block allows to obtain a class 

of  Ar-T4S4-Ar  oligothiophenes  whose  electronic  distribution  is  dictated  by  the  Ar  groups  but 

that  are  nevertheless  capable  to  form  structurally  similar  fibers  with  hierarchical  nano-  to 
3 

 
 
 
 
 
microscale supramolecular organization. The fibers are chemically and thermodynamically stable 

and  grow  with  the  same  modalities  on  different  substrates  such  as  glass,  gold,  ITO,  SiO2.  The 

variation of the electronic properties from 1 to 5 promotes the tuning of the functional properties 

of  the  fibers,  in  particular  of  their  optical  and  electrical  characteristics,  with  fluorescence 

spanning from visibile to near  IR and prevailing charge carriers  passing from p- to n-type. The 

properties  and  the  morphology  of  the  fibers  are  analyzed  here  by  a  variety  of  techniques: 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Circular Dichroism (CD), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), X-

ray  diffraction  (XRD),  UV-vis  and  PL  spectroscopies,  photoconductivity  measurements  and 

Kelvin  Probe  ForceMicroscopy  (KPFM).  Finally,  with  the  aid  of  Density  Functional  Theory 

(DFT) calculations the characteristics of the intermolecular interactions of the self-assembling 1-

5  are  investigated.  These  are  used,  together  with  X-ray  diffraction  data,  to  propose  a  model 

accounting for the growth of the fibers from molecular to nano- and microscale. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The head-to head regiochemistry of substitution and the alkyl chain length of the inner -T4S4- 

core  in  compounds  1-5  are  crucial  for  promoting  the  self-assembly  of  Ar-T4S4-Ar  oligothio-

phenes  into  fibers.  We  tested  several  other  ‘sulfur  overrich’  quaterthiophenes  having  different 

substitution patterns and different alkyl chain lengths and found them unable to promote the for-

mation  of  supramolecular  structures.  In  the  Supporting  Information  we  report  the  molecular 

structure, the synthesis and the characterization of all the tested quaterthiophenes, together with 

the  synthesis  and  characterization  of  3,3',3''',3''''',4'',4''''-hexakis(hexylthio)-2,2':5',2'':5'',2''':5''', 

2'''':5'''',2'''''- sexithiophene and of the the corresponding dodecamer also tested without any suc-

cess. 

Synthesis of compounds 1-5. Compounds 1-5 were synthesized as described in Scheme 2.  

Compounds 1-5 were obtained in high yield starting from the monobromo (1a) or the monostan-

nane (1d) of 3,3'-bis(hexylthio)-2,2'-bithiophene whose preparation is described in reference 15d. 

Compounds 1,3 and 5 were obtained from dibromoquaterhiophene 1c, described in the same ref-

erence, via Stille coupling with the appropriate stannanes. Compounds 2 and 4 were obtained by 

Suzuki coupling thhrough the newly synthesized trimers 1e and 1f after bromination and  subse-

quent treatment with  bis(pinacolato) diboron with microwave assistance.

Self-assembly  of  1-5  into  supramolecular  fibers  and  their  characterization.  Compounds  1-5 

spontaneously  self-assemble  into  crystalline  nanostructured  fibers  through  solvent-exchange  in 

solution,  in  which  the  molecules  move  from  a  good  solvent  (toluene)  into  a  poor  solvent 

(acetonitrile)  and  fast  evaporation  is  inhibited.16    Upon  about  one  hour  of  exposition  to 

acetonitrile vapours (see SI) of a 10-3-10-5 M solution of 1-5 in toluene, the formation of fibers 

with  high  aspect  ratio  and  characterized  by  micrometric  length  and  width  and  submicrometric 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
thickness was observed (Figure 1). The formation of the fibers was reproducibile and afforded the 

same results independently of the type of substrate employed (glass, SiO2, ITO, gold), indicating 

that  thermodynamically  stable  supramolecular  fibers  are  formed  and  that  the  morphologies  are 

mainly  determined  by  the  molecular  structure.  All  fibers  were  crystalline  as  shown  by  X-ray 

diffraction  (see  below)  and  optical  microscopy.  Figures  S37,  S38  and  S39  display  the  optical 

microscopy images with cross polarizers of the fibers obtained from compounds 1-5. Regardless 

of  morphology  they  showed  birefringence  estinguishing  in  four  positions  with  respect  to  the 

polarizers (every 90° rotation), indicating that the fibers had a high crystalline directional order. 

Figure  1  shows  representative  SEM  images  of  the  supramolecular  fibers.  It  is  seen  that 

compounds  1,2  afford  tape-like  fibers  whereas  compounds  3,4  display  the  presence  of  helical 

superstructures at the nano and microscale and compound 5 forms polymorphic fibers, tape-like 

as well as helical. Despite the lack of stereogenic centers in the starting molecule, oligomers 3-5 

form bundles of helices rolled into superhelical structures (coiled coils). Oligomer 3 (T4S4STN) 

affords fibers in the form of superhelices (helices of helices) and double helices of superhelices, 

all  displaying  the  same-hand  helicity  (left-handed  helicity,  M  type  double  helices).  For  this 

compound the inset in Figure 1 shows a large double helix of superhelices and indicates that the 

periodicity  of  the  superhelices  is  size  dependent.  The  SEM  images  relative  to  the  fibers  of 

compound 4 (T4S4CF) show the presence of nice superhelices of nanometer size (see the insets). 

Note  that  those  shown  in  the  inset  of  panel  a  display  opposite  handednesses.  Concerning 

compound  5  (T4S4BZ),  which  forms  polymorphic  fibers  with  different  morphology,  we  were 

able to obtain the tape-like fibers free from the helical ones (Figure 1, panel a) but not the latter in 

isolated  form.  Indeed,  the  helical  fibers  always  grow  on  top  of  tape-like  ones  in  the  form  of 

micrometer  sized  ‘fusilli’  (Figure  1,  panel  b)  or  as  nanometer  size  coils  wrapped  around  a 

micrometer  size  tape-like  fiber  (Figure  1,  panel  c).  All  fibers  −  whether  tape-like  or  helical  − 

displayed circular dichroism signals (Figure 1) corresponding to the  transition in the UV-

vis spectrum of the starting oligomer. Signal intensities ranged from a few mdeg () for 1, 3, 5 to 

40 mdeg () for 4 to 100 mdeg () for 2.

Since  1-5  are  centrosymmetric  molecules  and  do  not  have  chiral  centers,  no  CD  signals  are 

observed  in  solution.  Thus,  the  CD  signals  observed  for  the  fibers  are  related  to  their 

supramolecular  organization  at  the  nanoscale.  Indeed,  it  is  well  known  that  the  main  source  of 

CD  signals  comes  from  adjacent  interacting  cromophores  giving  rise  to  excitons  within  a 

nanometer  scale  range.17  One  possible  factor  generating  chirality  in  the  centrosymmetric 

oligomers 1-5 are distorsions from planarity upon deposition of the molecules on the substrate. In 

this case, even if the bias of one or more thiophene rings from the molecular plane is very small, 

the  molecules  lose  all  symmetry  elements  and  become  chiral  (conformational  chirality).  In 

addition  (or  in  alternative),  the  interactions  between  two  molecules  −  as  soon  as  they  come  in 

contact,  see  the  calculations  below  −  also  lead  to  distorsions  hence  to  desymmetrization  of  the 

molecules.  Subsequently,  during  the  dynamic  assembly  process,  chirality  amplification18  may 

take  place  generating  an  observable  CD  signal.  Since  upon  deposition  and/or  intermolecular 

interaction the bias of a tiophene ring from the molecular plane (changes in interring angles   

can occur in  one or the  opposite direction ( or both  hand-helicities  may be expected in 

different  points  of  the  same  sample  or  in  two  different  samples,15a,b  resulting  in  CD  signals 

displaying opposite Cotton effects. In agreement with expectations, the CD of all compounds but 

3  display  a  Cotton  effect  of  one  sign  and  also  of  the  opposite  one  corresponding  to  opposite 

helicity of the aggregates at the nanoscale. Nanoaggregates of opposite helicity are clearly visible 

in the SEM images of the fibers obtained from 4 (Figure 1, panel a) and 5 (Figure 1, panel c). The 

CD  spectra  of  the  tape-like  fibers  of  compounds  1  and  2  reveal  the  presence  of  nanoscale 

aggregates  of  opposite  helicity,  which  is  lost  at  higher  aggregation  scales,  possibly  due  to 

molecular  packing  effects.  The  fibers  formed  by  2  give  rise  to  the  largest  CD  intensity  of  all 

fibers. Since one of the factors determining the intensity of the CD signal is the proximity of the 

interacting cromophores,17 this result is in agreement with the fact that the fibers formed by 2 are 

the  most  compact  and  of  the  highest  crystalline  quality  (see  X-ray  diffraction  section).  Of  all 

fibers  only  those  pertaining  to  compound  3  afforded  a  CD  signal  displaying  only  one  single 

(positive) Cotton effect. Despite repeated attempts on different samples and on different points of 

the  same  sample,  we  were  unable  to  detect  the  CD  signal  of  opposite  sign.  The  simplest 

explanation  for  this  behavior  is  that  one  of  all  possible  conformations  of  3  is  largely  preferred 

over all other ones but  we do not  have  any experimental evidence for this.  We limit  ourself to 

note  that  the  positive  sign  of  the  long  wavelength  part  of  the  CD  signal  of  3  indicates  the 
8 

 
 
presence of a right handed helix at the nanoscale17 while the micrometer sized double helices of 

superhelices  observed  in  the  SEM  images  are  indicative  of  left-handed  helicity  (M  type)  at  the 

microscale. Thus, the right-handed helices present at the nanoscale self-assemble into left-handed 

super helices at the microscale, a behaviour reminiscent of that of collagen19  and also observed in 

other types of fibers.20 

As soon as they are formed the self-assembled fibers of 1-5 are always randomly distributed on 

the different substrates used. However, the integration of the fibers into a device requires that the 

self-assembly takes place in a confined space dictated by the features of the substrate employed 

and that the characteristics of the fibers are mantained.15d  In the present case we found that well-

ordered  aligned  fibers  can  be  obtained  making  use  of  the  Lithographically  Controlled  Wetting 

(LCW)21  technique  to  direct  their  self-assembly.  Figure  2  shows  well  aligned  fibers  of 

compounds 2 (tape-like) and 4 (helical) grown with the LCW technique.

5 µm. Inset image (B): zoom 5x5 µm2.

A few drops of the  compound dissolved in  toluene were  first  placed on  a silicon wafer, then a 

polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepatterned  stamp was placed on the top and the whole system 

exposed at  room temperature (r.t.) for 24 h to  the vapours of the (non-solvent) acetonitrile in  a 

sealed container. In both cases parallel microfibers of similar dimensions, in particular width (1 

m) and height (150-300 nm) were obtained. The figure shows that while 2 affords straight tape-

like fibers, 4 forms straight fibers made of tightly intertwined helical segments,  indicating once 

again that even in a confined environment the morphology of the self-assembled fibers is mainly 

dependent on the molecular structure. 

Optical properties. A comprehensive photo-physical analysis of compounds 1-5 in solution and 

as solid films was carried out. Table 1 reports the maxima in the absorption and emission spectra, 

the molar coefficients and the quantum yields of compounds 1-5 in solution, in cast films and as 

fibers while Table S1 reports the emission lifetimes in CH2Cl2 at r.t. The corresponding spectra 

are shown in Figure 3.

All compounds show broad absorption bands associated to the lowest energy  π-π* transition of 

the central thiophenic backbone, with the corresponding maxima shifting to higher wavelengths 

in  the  presence  of  strong  electron-withdrawing  groups  such  as  -NO2  and  -COC6F13  as  the 

outermost substituents. As a consequence, solutions of  1-5 cover a range of colors from yellow 

(1,  T4S4T)  to  wine  red  (2,  T4S4TNO2),  with  extinction  coefficients  included  between  circa 

30000 and 41000 M-1cm-1.

Emission spectra in CH2Cl2 at r.t. show a similar trend (Figure 3B), with maxima red-shifting in 

the  visible  spectrum  in  a  range  between  540  and  670  nm,  while  quantum  efficiencies  result 

strongly dependent on the type of substituent, dropping from 0.34 for 1 to 0.004 for 2. With the 

exception  of  2,  drop-cast  samples  from  CH2Cl2  solutions  showed  appreciable  luminescence 

signals,  with  4  displaying  a  broad  emission  profile  with  a  maximum  in  the  NIR  region  around 

820 nm (Figure 3D). As for the emission quantum yields of amorphous films of 1-5, likely due to 

the increased predominance of packing-induced radiationless deactivation pathways25-26, they are 

lower  compared  to  those  recorded  in  solution  and  below  the  limit  of  detection  of  our 

instrumentation  (Φ<0.005).  Emission  lifetimes  (see  Table  S1),  determined  in  the  same 

conditions,  point  out  singlet  excited  state  deactivations  with  sub-  nanosecond  decays.  For  the 

majority of the molecules taken in exam, multiexponential decays were evidenced, possibly due 

to  inhomogeneities  between  the  adopted  different  conformations  in  solution  and  in  amorphous 

films,  as  revealed  for  other  thiophene-based  oligo-  and  polymeric  structures.27-28  Moreover,  in 

drop-cast  films of 1-5, the relatively strong interactions  occurring intermolecularly likely  affect 

their  absorption  profiles  (Figure  3C),  showing  the  broadening  and  the  red-shift  of  the  lowest 

energy  absorption  maxima  with  respect  to  the  signals  recorded  in  solution.  This  trend  is  even 

more evident when molecules organize in crystalline fibers on glass surfaces (Figure 3E), which 

display  broader  absorptions  at  lower  energies  (up  to  800  nm  for  2  and  4)  compared  to  those 

recorded on drop-cast films. In the case of 5 (T4S4BZ), the wide-ranging absorption spectrum of 

the crystalline fibers reflects the presence of different polymorphs in the same sample (see also 

Figure 1). More interestingly, deposited fibers show appreciable luminescence (Φ~0.01 for 1 and 

3), ranging from the orange-red of 1 towards the NIR spectrum (Figure 4F). More specifically, 4 

and  2  show  their  fluorescence  maximum  around  830  and  840  nm,  respectively,  with  a  broad 

emission profile extending up to 1200 nm (~1.05 eV). 

Cyclic  Voltammetry.  Table  2  reports  the  redox  potentials  of  compounds  1-5  in  solution,  cast 

films  from  CH2Cl2  and  as  fibers.  The  corresponding  cyclovoltammetries  are  reported  in 

Supporting  Information  (Figure  S40)  together  with  a  few  comments.  In  the  present  context  the 

most  significant  result  is  that  for  all  compounds  the  reduction  potential  of  the  fibers  is 

significantly  less  negative  than  that  measured  in  solution  and  in  cast  film,  indicating  that  self-

assembly  into  fibers  leads  to  the  increase  in  electron  affinity.  For  example,  compound  1  in 

solution  and  in  cast  film  has  a  reduction  wave  outside  the  electrochemical  window  of  the 
12 

 
 
electrolyte  (<  -1.8  V)  while  the  corresponding  fibers  show  a  reduction  potential  of  -1.41  V, 

indicating  an  increases  in  electron  affinity  of  about  400  mV.  Also  compounds  2-5  show  less 

negative  reduction  potentials  when  grown  in  solid  state  with  respect  to  the  solution  and,  in 

particular,  when  the  order  of  the  solid  is  driven  towards  the  fibers.  The  displacement  of  the 

reduction  potentials  towards  less  negative  values  in  the  fibers  compared  to  the  solution  varies 

from 80 mV in 2 (T4S4TNO2) to 430 mV in 5 (T4S4BZ).

Passing from the solution to the fibers the oxidation potential decreases by 70 mV in 1, 80 mV in 

2, 100 mV in  3. However,  the opposite trend is observed in  4 and  5, as the oxidation potential 

increases  by  160  mV  and  110  mV,  respectively.  As  a  result  for  all  compounds  there  is  a  net 

decrease in the energy gap from solution to the fibers, the lowest energy gap observed being that 

of compound 2 (1.53 eV).  

DFT  calculations.  To  understand  the  basic  interactions  governing  the  aggregation  in  fibers  we 

studied the dimers of molecules 1-5 using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Ground-

state calculations and geometry optimizations were performed with the TURBOMOLE program 

package29-30  using  the  BLOC  exchange-correlation31-33  functional  and  the  multipole  accelerated 

resolution of identity approximation.34 For isolated molecules a def2-TZVP basis set35 was em-

ployed.  For  the  dimers,  the  optimal  structures  have  been  identified  performing  a  preliminary 

screening, via geometry optimizations at the BLOC/def2-SV(P) level of theory,31-33,36 on a large 

number  (about  100)  of  guess  structures  generated  by  random  displacements  of  two  monomers. 

Subsequently, the 20 best candidates have been optimized at the BLOC/def2-TZVP level to iden-

tify  the  most  stable  configuration.  The  calculated  interaction  energies  of  the  dimers 

[kcal/(mol*atom)]  are  the  following:  0.13  (1,  T4S4T);  0.19  (2,T4S4NO2);  0.17  (3,T4S4TN); 

0.12 (4, T4S4CF); 0.15 (5, T4S4BZ). Their structure  is depicted in in the X-ray diffraction sec-

tion below (see Figure 7). We have found that in all cases, partially excepting compound  4, the 

 stacking between the molecular backbones plays a major role. This is very evident in the di-

mer of sexithiophene 1, where the  stacking is basically the only force binding the two mole-

cules. Adding side substituents or varying the terminal groups, however, additional effects start to 

be relevant. These are related to a significant charge redistribution in the molecules, which is vis-

ualized in Figure 4, where the electrostatic potential generated by each molecule are reported. In 

the  case  of  5,  having  terminal  benzothiadiazole  groups,  the  net  effect  is  not  very  large  and  the 

molecules in the dimer show only small distortions with respect to the isolated ones. This traces 

back to the fact that, despite an important charge depletion on the thiadiazole moiety, the charge 

distribution in the molecular backbone and the side hexyls is not much perturbed. Thus, the main 

bonding character is still a stacking. On the contrary, in compounds 3 and 2, the presence of 

oxygen atoms in the terminal substituents, induces a stronger polarization, with charge depletion 

in the hexyls (and partially in the backbone) and charge accumulation on the oxygens. As a con-

sequence, when two molecules interact, hydrogen bonds can form. These involve the oxygen at-

oms and some hydrogens in the hexyls (or, to a less extent, in the backbone). 

14 

 
 
Figure 4. Electrostatic potential (in au) on the van der Waals surface for isolated 1-5. 

To  this  purpose,  we  have  performed  a  study  using  the  NCI  indicator37-38  −  which  can  identify 

hydrogen  bonding  regions  and  highlight  them  in  real  space  −  using  the  NCI  PLOT  program.39 

The  corresponding  plot  is  reported  in  Figure  5,  and  shows  indeed  hydrogen-bond  regions 

between  the  oxygen  atoms  and  the  hydrogens  (or  the  backbone).  Nevertheless,  because  of  fine 

differences between the two molecules and especially due to the different position of the oxygens 

(out of plane in 3, in plane in 2), the final dimers' structures are different in the two cases. For 3, 

we observe prominently hydrogen bond interactions involving the hexyls, thus in the dimer the 

two  molecules  tend  to  twist  onto  each  other,  despite  the  molecular  backbone  is  not  strongly 

distorted. 

15

(T4S4CF)  identifying  hydrogen  bonding  regions  (the  green  regions  between  the  two  molecules).  For 
clarity the isosurfaces were generated only for the regions indicated by the boxes. 

On the other hand, in 2, the oxygen atoms do not interact with the hydrogens in the hexyls but 

preferably with the molecular backbone. Consequently, instead of a twisting of the two molecules 

around  each  other,  we  rather  observe  strong  distortion  of  the  backbone  of  each  individual 

molecule.  Finally,  considering  compound  4  we  see  that  the  presence  of  many  fluorine  atoms 

induces  a  significant  depletion  of  charge  in  the    system  of  the  molecular  backbone  with 

consequent accumulation on the fluorines. Accordingly, in the dimer we do not observe anymore 

a  significant  stacking  interaction  but  rather  an  interaction  between  the  fluorines  of  one 

molecule and the backbone of the other molecule.  

X-ray  diffraction.  All  the  fibers  were  analyzed  by  X-ray  diffraction  and  found  to  be  highly 

crystalline. The X-ray diffraction plots of the microfibers from 1-5 are shown in Figure 6.  

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6. X-ray diffraction pattern of the fibers of 1-5 grown on glass. 

All samples display patterns with sharp and separated peaks, flat background, presence of second 

order  reflections,  indicating  highly  crystalline  materials.  The  interlayer  distances  of  peaks 

registered  at  the  lowest  angular  values  generally  give  the  direct  measurement  of  translational 

vectors  in  the  crystal.  In  this  hypothesis,  the  fibers  from  5  (T4S4BZ),  4  (T4S4CF)  and  3 

(T4S4TN),  show  reflections  corresponding  to  a  2.4-2.5  nm  distance,  those  grown  from  2 

(T4S4TNO2)  show  a  slightly  smaller  distance,  2.2  nm,  while  the  distance  measured  for  those 

grown  from  1  (T4S4T)  is  1.6  nm.  Putting  these  values  together  with  the  molecular  lengths 

obtained from theoretical calculations, a unique packing pattern can be proposed within the unit 

cells  having  molecules  differently  inclined  with  respect  to  the  main  crystallographic  axes,  as 

sketched in Figure 7. Concerning the fibers grown from  4, an overall decrease of the diffracted 

intensity  and  an  increase  of  full  width  at  half-maximum  (FWHM)  of  the  most  intense  peak 

(0.23°) is observed, almost twice that of the other fibers (0.11°). FWHM is a draft indicator of 

the crystal size: the smaller it is, the bigger the main size of the crystal domains is. This proves 

that in the experimental conditions used  the crystals of 4 are less perfect and with shorter

coherent domains than all the others, likely due to the presence of the long fluorinated terminal 

chains assuming disordered conformations. In Supporting Information (Figure S41) we report for 

comparison the X-ray diffraction patterns of the cast films of  1-5 deposited from CH2Cl2. Only 

the  films  from  1,  2  and  3  show  peaks  due  to  crystalline  order,  the  peaks  being  however  at 

different  angular  values  with  respect  to  those  of  the  corresponding  fibers  hence  indicating  a 

different  type  of  solid  state  aggregation.  Moreover,  worse  overall  quality,  smaller  number  of 

peaks and bigger peak widths indicative of less order and smaller crystal domains are observed.  

Combining the X-ray data with the information from DFT calculations it was possible to elabo-

rate a common model for the growth of tape-like and helical fibers. The mechanism proposed for 

the growth modalities of the fibers and the chirality transfer from the molecular level to the meso- 

and microscale of compounds 1-5 is illustrated in Figure 8.  

Figure 8. Proposed model for the formation of tape-like and helical crystalline fibers from 1-5. 

As suggested by the theoretical calculations, some torsional flexibility is present in the thiophenic 

backbones  of  all  the  molecules  as  a  result  of  intermolecular  interactions,  based  mainly  on   

stacking  for  compounds  1  and  5  and    stacking  mediated  by  hydrogen  bonds  for  2-4.  It  is 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
reasonable to assume that this molecular torsion, which contributes to conformational chirality, is 

maintained inside the unit cell of the crystal. Several unit cells are coherently aligned to form the 

crystal  domains,  the  linear  dimension  of  which,  as  roughly  estimated  from  the  FWHM  of  the 

XRD  main  peak,  is  about  85  nm  that  corresponds  to  about  35  unit  cells  (35  nm  for  4 

corresponding to about 20 unit cells). Each crystal is formed by several domains. The crystalline 

unit cells assemble together to form platelets subsequently packing either as tape-like fibers as in 

1-2, or as coiled fibers as in  3-5 depending on packing forces. The chirality transfer to a larger 

scale  takes  place  during  the  growth  of  the  nanocrystals:  regular  stacking  faults  driven  by 

intermolecular  interactions  cause  the  formation  of  elongated  helices  developing  in  the  growth 

direction.  As  reported  above,  the  long  fluorurated  alkyl  chains  of  4  have  some  difficulties  to 

regularly assemble in the crystal and in consequence the crystal domains are smaller. The same is 

true for the crystals that enlarge twisting and shifting during the stacking process thus growing as 

a more screwed helix. Strong polarization and formation of important hydrogen bonds between 

molecules  of  3  can  be  the  reasons  of  a  more  regular  interaction,  resulting  on  the  large  scale  in 

very regular helices. 

Photoconductivity. All the fibers of 1-5 are photoconductive, i.e. they become more electrically 

conductive  upon  absorption  of  visible  light.  We  evaluated  the  photoresponse  of  the  fibers 

networks deposited on planar gold electrodes by measuring their conductivity in dark conditions 

and  under  an  impinging  constant  illumination  from  a  white  light  source  with  an  intensity  of  1 

mW/cm2 (Figure 9A). The individual measurements for the different fiber samples are reported in 

Figure  S43,  while  Figure  9C  shows  the  the  measurements  for  two  representative  fibers,  those 

obtained from compounds 1 and 5. In the case of 1, dark conductivity is very low, at the limit of 

our  measuring  setup  (<  1  pA  at  a  bias  of  5  V);  when  irradiated,  a  marked  photoresponse  is 

detected, with the current increasing more than a factor of 10 (~20 pA at 5 V). In the case of 5, 

which is four orders of magnitude more conductive in dark (~800 pA at 5 V), the photoresponse 

is much weaker, with an increase < 2. Overall, the devices drive currents in the range 1 pA to 1 

nA in both conditions, at a bias of 5 V, in agreement with literature reports for oligothiophene-

based  self-  assembled  nanostructures40  and  poly(3-hexylthiophene  films).

41  The  morphology  of 

the  deposited  active  layers,  being  a  network  of  semiconducting  fibers,  does  not  allow  a  direct 

comparison of the conductivities between the different samples without estimating the coverage 

of  the  fibers  onto  the  substrate  and  the  electrodes.  We  therefore  restricted  our  analysis  to  the 
19 

 
 
assessment of the photo-response properties of the materials through the measurement of the ratio 

between the conductivities in the “light” and “dark” conditions (Figure 9B).  

Figure 9. A) Device structure for the measurement of the photo-response of the fibers of 1-5 grown on 
photolithographically-defined gold electrodes on glass, B) Ratio of the conductivities of the materials in 
the “light” and “dark” conditions. C) Current-Voltage measurements for the fibers of 1 (left panel) and 5 
(right  panel)  grown  on  photolithographically-defined  gold  electrodes  on  glass  in  the  “dark”  (black  line) 
and in the “light” (red line) conditions. 

Overall,  four  of  the  materials  behave  similarly  to  5,  exhibiting  a  very  limited  light/dark  ratio, 

lower  than  2,  while  those  obtained  from  1  exhibit  a  much  higher  ratio  of  36,  an  order  of 

magnitude higher than the other homologue materials. While it is not possible to conclude about 

the  photoresponse  mechanism  here,  we  observe  that  the  highest  on-off  ratio  is  obtained  in  the 

case  of 

the  network  characterized  by 

the 

lowest  dark  current,  possibly 

implying  a 

photoconduction or photoinjection mechanism.42 

KPFM  characterization.  The  of  1-5  grown  on  glass  were  analyzed  by  Kelvin  Probe  Force 

Microscopy (KPFM)43 for the measurement of the surface electronic potential. In particular, the 

technique allows to measure the work function of the fibers with respect to the gold tip value:  = 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
fiber - Au. The work functions of the fibers of 1-5 are reported in Figure 10. In agreement with 

previous characterizations,44 we can clearly distinguish two classes of fibers.  

Figure  10.  Surface  electronic  potential  measured  by  KPFM  for  the  fibers  of  1-5  grown  on  glass  and 
energy diagram for p-type and n-type charge carriers. 

Indeed,  the  fibers  obtained  from  1  show  a  work  function  value  higher  than  gold  (  –  Au  >  0) 

corresponding to the increase of hole density at surface (electrons moving from the fibers to the 

tip) whereas the fibers obtained from 2-5 show work function values lower than gold ( – Au < 

0)  corresponding  to  an  increase  of  the  electron  density  (electrons  moving  from  the  tip  to  the 

fiber). This evidence allows to adress the fibers of 1 as a p-type whereas the fibers of 2-5 are n-

type,  i.e.  the  functionalization  with  electron  acceptors  causes  the  reversal  of  the  sign  of  charge 

carriers. The  results  are  in  agreement with  cyclovoltammetry data, indicating that passing from 

the  fibers  formed  by  1  to  those  formed  by  2-5  there  is  a  marked  increase  in  electron  affinity 

(Table 2).

CONCLUSIONS 

Using thiophene based oligomers we have demonstrated that it is possible to establish a straight-

forward  correlation  between  the  functional  properties  of  self-assembled  nano/micro-  fibers  and 

the  molecular  structure  of  the  precursors.  To  this  purpose  oligomers  including  building  blocks 

containing in their covalent network the information needed to promote anisotropic growth  and 

capable  to  undergo  modifications  in  their  electronic  distribution  without  altering  the  self-

assembly  modalities  are  required.  If  these  conditions  are  fulfilled,  a  wide  tuning  of  important 

properties is achievable. In the present work we have described one of such  building blocks, i.e. 

a ‘non covalent interactional algorithm’ (according to the definition of J. M. Lehn11), which ena-

bled an unprecedented tuning of various properties within a set of comparable crystalline, elec-

troactive, self-assembled nano/microfibers. In particular, we describe here changes in polarity of 

major charge carriers from p-type to n-type, light emission from visible to NIR and extended tun-

ing of electrochemical energy gaps.  

We expect that the search for novel ‘non covalent interactional algorithms’ will be particularly 

fruitful in the field of thiophene oligomers, which are very versatile functional materials, fluores-

cent and conductive, with astonishing recognition capabilities  via non-bonded interactions even 

inside living cells and organisms.45 They can physiologically co-assemble with specific proteins 

inside live cells15e  and  are p-type semiconductors but can acquire n-type charge transport proper-

ties by sulfur functionalization with oxygen.46 Thus, it is probably not too hazardous to believe 

that  the  identification  of  appropriate  ‘non  covalent  interactional  algorithms’  will  be  beneficial 

not only to the search of new and more performing materials for organic electronics and optoelec-

tronics but also to the discovery of new properties of thiophene compounds for their application 

in fields at the frontier of biology, medicine and supramolecular chemistry.
