Abstract

R

In the paper [1], J. Berson, J. W. Bikker and A. van den Essen proved that for a non-
zerodivisor a in a commutative ring R containing Q if the polynomials f1, . . . , fn−1

then
in R[X1, . . . , Xn] form a partial coordinate system over the rings Ra and
f1, . . . , fn−1 form a partial coordinate system over the ring R. In this note we show
that the theory of residual variables of Bhatwadekar-Dutta ([2]) and its recent extension
by Das-Dutta ([3]), extends their result to the case when a is an arbitrary element of
A.

Introduction

We will assume all rings to be commutative containing unity. Throughout this note we
will use the notation R[X1, . . . , Xn] to mean a polynomial algebra in n variables over
R. Sometimes we will denote this ring by R[n].

Let A := R[X1, . . . , Xn]. We recall that m polynomials f1, . . . , fm (m ≤ n) in A are said
to form a partial coordinate system (of colength n − m) in A if A = R[f1, . . . , fm][n−m].
If m = n then we will say f1, . . . , fn form a coordinate system in A. For an arbitrary
a ∈ R, f1, . . . , fm in A are said to form an a-strongly partial residual coordinate system
(of colength n−m) in A if the images of f1, . . . , fm form a partial coordinate system (of
colength n − m) in
and also in Aa. We will say f1, . . . , fm form a partial residual
coordinate system (of colength n − m) in A if, for each prime ideal p of R we have
k(p) ⊗R A = (k(p) ⊗R R[f1, . . . , fm])[n−m], where k(p) :=
at p.

Theorem 1.1. Let R be a ring containing Q, a ∈ R a non-zerodivisor and A =
R[X1, . . . , Xn]. If n−1 polynomials f1, . . . , fn−1 in A form an a-strongly partial residual
coordinate system in A, then f1, . . . , fn−1 form a partial coordinate system in A.

They conjectured the following ([1, Conjecture 4.4]):

Conjecture. Theorem 1.1 also holds even when a is a zerodivisor in R.

In this note we observe that an aﬃrmative solution to the above conjecture can be
deduced from the following formulation of a result of Das-Dutta ([3, Corollary 3.19]).

Theorem 1.2. Let R be a Noetherian ring containing Q, A = R[n] and f1, . . . , fn−1 ∈
A. Then the following are equivalent:

(i) f1, . . . , fn−1 form a partial coordinate system in A.
(ii) f1, . . . , fn−1 form a partial residual coordinate system in A.

Remark 1.3. We note the following observations on the above result

(i) Although the result is stated in the paper [3] for Noetherian domains containing
Q, the proof is an application of Theorem 3.13 and Theorem 2.4 in [3] which hold over
any Noetherain ring containing Q (not necessarily a domain).

(ii) The case n = 2 was previously proved by Bhatwadekar-Dutta ([2, Theorem

3.1]).

2 Proof of the conjecture

Theorem 2.1. Let R be a ring containing Q, a ∈ R be arbitrary and A = R[X1, . . . , Xn].
If n − 1 polynomials f1, . . . , fn−1 in A form an a-strongly partial residual coordinate
system of colength 1 in A, then f1, . . . , fn−1 form a partial coordinate system in A.

Proof. Since f1, . . . , fn−1 form an a-strongly partial residual coordinate system in A,
there exist g, h ∈ A such that

[X1, . . . , Xn] =

[f1, . . . , fn−1, g]

Ra[X1, . . . , Xn] = Ra[f1, . . . , fn−1, h].

and

Hence we have,

for some Gi ∈ R[f1, . . . , fn−1, g] and Hi ∈ A (1 ≤ i ≤ n);

Xi = Gi + aHi

where ei,m1,...,mn−1,m ∈ R, for all i, mj, m (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ n − 1, mj, m, ki ≥ 0).

Now, let S be the Q-subalgebra of R generated by the subset of R consisting of a; all
coeﬃcients of Gi (for all i) as polynomials in f1, . . . , fn−1, g; coeﬃcients of Hi (for all i);
coeﬃcients of g, h, fi (for all i) and ei,m1,...,mn−1,m (for all i and for all m, mj). Then S is

a Noetherian Q-algebra. Let p be an arbitrary prime ideal of S and B := S[X1, . . . , Xn].
If a ∈ p then from (1), we have k(p) ⊗S B = (k(p) ⊗S S[f1, . . . , fn−1])[1]. If a /∈ p then
from (2), we have k(p) ⊗S B = (k(p) ⊗S S[f1, . . . , fn−1])[1]. So, f1, . . . , fn−1 form a
partial residual coordinate system (of colength 1) in B. Since S is Noetherian, hence
by Theorem 1.2, f1, . . . , fn−1 form a partial coordinate system in B and hence in A.
