Abstract

Straw tube detectors are single wire proportional counters that are widely
used as a tracking device. We have carried out R&D with a straw tube
detector prototype. The motivation of this work is to study the stability of
the performance in terms of gain and energy resolution of the straw tube
detectors under high rate radiation. Two diﬀerent methods are incorporated
to perform this study. The gain and energy resolution of the detector are
studied along with its variation with ambient temperature and pressure. X-
ray from a radioactive source is used to irradiate the detector and the same
source is also used to monitor the energy spectra simultaneously for calculation
of gain. Variation of the gain and energy resolution of the straw tube detector
under X-ray irradiation in Ar/CO2 gas mixture is discussed in this article. We
have also estimated the time resolution of the straw tube detectors that can
be best achieved with cosmic rays as trigger for the same gas mixture. The
details of the measurement process and the experimental results are presented
in this article.

1 Introduction

Straw tube detectors are single wire cylindrical proportional chambers that
have been used, in many high energy physics experiments over the decades
such as ATLAS [1], NA62 [2] experiment at CERN and GlueX [3] experiment
in Hall D at JLab for tracking of charged particles with low material budget.
Straw proportional tubes have potential to be used as tracking devices in the
future high energy physics experiments [4, 5, 6] involving very high particle
density and extremely high interaction rate. Therefore, it is crucial to test

the rate handling capability [7] and the eﬀect of prolonged radiation on the
detectors. Earlier studies of straw tubes with Xe/CF4/CO2 gas mixture has
revealed gain degradation [9, 8]. This transient aging phenomenon observed
in strongly irradiated straw tubes is because of change in the gas composition
due to a production of long-lived and highly electronegative radicals during
the avalanche process. This causes a temporary reduction in gain, which can
be restored by an appropriate increase of the gas ﬂow rate. There are more
reports on radiation hardness and aging eﬀects of straw tube detectors [10, 11]
performed with Xe based gas mixtures. However, Ar/CO2 is by far a much
more widely used mixture in gaseous particle detectors. As far as CO2 gas is
concerned, it is believed to be an aging resistant gas unlike other organic gases
that are mixed with noble gas to quench secondary photons. Pure Ar/CO2 gas
showed stable operation up to ∼ 1 C/cm [11, 12, 13, 14], while some reports
showed unexplained gain reduction with this gas [15, 16]. Our goal was to
operate the straw tube detector under conditions as close as possible to the
real environment of high energy physics experiments in terms of total charge
accumulated on the detector over its lifetime. We wanted to study the eﬀect
of long term exposure to radiation of straw tube detectors and to verify if gas
aging phenomena takes place or not without imposing accelerated aging. In
this regard, two separate experiments were performed. In the ﬁrst experiment,
stability tests for the absolute gain and energy resolution of one straw tube
under X-ray radiation was carried out. The experimental setup and results
are discussed in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 respectively. The inﬂuence of
temperature and pressure on the gas gain is also studied. Reduction in gain
after continuous operation for a very long time is observed in this experiment.
To conﬁrm that this gain reduction is due to the aging phenomena, another
experiment using two straw tubes, one as a reference and the other as a test
detector was carried out. The reference straw was under the inﬂuence of a low
rate of X-ray radiation whereas the other one was under a higher rate of X-ray
radiation. A comparison of the gain of both the straws was done at certain
time intervals during continuous radiation exposure. A detailed description of
the experimental setup and discussion on the results are included in Section 3.1
and Section 3.2 respectively. The diﬀerence between the ﬁrst and the second
experiment was that, the latter was conducted at relatively lower gas ﬂow
rates for reasons discussed in Section 5. Time resolution of the detector is
another important factor of concern in any tracking system. We have used
cosmic rays as the radiation source and measured the time resolution of the
straw tube detector. The experimental setup and results are discussed in
Section 4.

2 Stability test of straws : Experiment I

In this experiment, our main focus is to measure the gain of the straw tube
detector continuously at ﬁnite intervals and observe its variation with expo-
sure to radiation. Since we know that the gain of a gaseous detector has a

2

dependency on ambient temperature and pressure [17], we also tried to check
their correlation.

2.1 Experimental set up

The straw tube prototype used in this experiment is built in JINR, Dubna,
Russia. It consist of 6 straws of diameter 6 mm and length 25 cm. The straw
tube was fabricated from a kapton ﬁlm, one side containing a conductive layer
of 1000-3000 ˚A Al + 4 µm carbon-loaded kapton and the other side containing
a thermoplastic polyurethane layer of 3 µm. Two kapton ﬁlm tapes (4-8 mm
wide) were wound in spiral at a temperature of around 200 ◦C. The thickness
of the straw wall is around 65 µm and the diameter of gold plated tungsten
central wire is 30 µm. There is a provision to collect signals from each straw
through LEMO connector. A premixed gas of Argon and CO2 in 80/20 volume
ratio is used in ﬂow mode at a rate of 3 l/hr.

The central anode wire of the straws are biased with positive high voltage
(HV) using a HV ﬁlter box at one end and the signal is collected from the
other end after a capacitor. The output signal from the straw is fed to a
charge sensitive pre-ampliﬁer having gain 2 mV/fC and shaping time of 300 ns.
The output of the pre-ampliﬁer is put to a linear Fan-in-Fan-Out (FIFO)
module. One output of the linear FIFO is put to a timing SCA (Single Channel
Analyzer), which is operated in integral mode and the lower level in the SCA
is used as the threshold. A NIM based scalar module is used to measure the
count rate from the detector. A Multi Channel Analyser (MCA) is used to
obtain the energy spectra with Fe55 X-ray source taking another output from
the linear FIFO. A schematic of the setup is shown in Fig. 1. A typical energy
spectra for Fe55 in Ar/CO2 80/20 mixture at 1550 V is shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 1: Schematic of the setup for the stability test of the straw tube detector.

The gain of the straw tube detector is calculated in the following way. The
5.9 keV peak of the Fe55 X-ray spectrum is ﬁtted with a Gaussian function and

from the mean of the ﬁtted peak, the charge after avalanche multiplication
(output charge) is calculated using the gain of the pre-ampliﬁer (in mV/fC)
and the calibration factor (C.F.) of the MCA channel number and pulse height
(in mV). The expression for gain is given by the ratio of output charge and
input charge :

gain =

(1)

(2)

The preampliﬁer used in the set-up oﬀers a gain of 2 mV/fC. The average
number of primary electrons produced in the gas is taken as 217 for Ar/CO2
80/20 mixture assuming full energy deposition of 5.9 keV X-ray in the gas
volume. The energy resolution of the straw tube detector is deﬁned as :

% energy resolution =

Sigma × 2.355
M ean

× 100 %

(3)

where Sigma and Mean are obtained from the Gaussian ﬁtting of the 5.9 keV
peak of each Fe55 X-ray spectrum. The typical gain of the straw tube detector
is found to be 1.4 × 104 at a biasing voltage of 1550 V.
In order to study the eﬀect of prolonged radiation on the detector, a collimated
X-ray source is placed on top of the detector and continuous monitoring of
the energy spectra with the same source is carried out. A realistic particle
rate of 40 kHz/mm was set using the collimator. The spectra are stored
automatically at regular intervals of ten minutes. A data logger [18] made in
house was used to record ambient temperature and pressure online.

2.2 Results

The gain of the straw tube is measured at regular intervals as mentioned
earlier. The gain as a function of time is shown in Fig. 3 along with the

variation of the ratio of ambient temperature (T=t+273 K) and pressure (p)
with time. From Fig. 3 it can be seen that during this period of more than
800 hrs, the gain decreased from 15000 to 13000. This may be the eﬀect of
prolonged radiation. The aging rate is parameterized as a normalized gas gain

where G0 is the initial gas gain, dG is the loss of gas gain after collected

instantaneous gain (gaint) by the initial value of the gain (gaint0) and plotted
it against charge accumulated per unit length of the straw tube detector as
shown in Fig. 4. The accumulated charge over the straw tube is calculated
using the relation,

detector, n is the number of primary electrons for a single X-ray photon, e is
the electronic charge, G is the gain of the detector, dt is the time in second and
dl is the irradiated length of the straw. In this case the straw tube is exposed
to continuous radiation for more than 800 hrs, owing to an accumulation of
0.6 C/cm of charge. As shown in Fig. 4 the normalised gain is ﬁtted by a
1st order polynomial function. Using the value of the slope (p1) the aging
rate is calculated to be 9.6 % per C/cm. However, this observation needs a
conﬁrmatory test to ensure that this is purely due to radiation and no other
external eﬀects are responsible. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the variation
of gain depends on variation in T/p. Although there is not much variation in
T/p throughout the experiment, we still tried to ﬁnd a correlation of gain with
T/p and is shown in Fig. 5. It is seen from Fig. 5 that the points are scattered
and so the χ2/NDF of the ﬁt is bad. Therefore, it can be said that there are
other parameters also in addition to T/p, responsible for the variation of gain.

mulated charge [19]. Apart from that, the aging rate is aﬀected by macroscopic
parameters such as, high gas gain, radiation intensity and gas ﬂow rate. In
that direction, the next experiment is carried out with high radiation intensity
and low gas ﬂow rates to observe aging rates for straw tube in a practically
lesser amount of time.

Fig. 6 shows the variation of the energy resolution with time.

In this
experiment, it is observed that the energy resolution increases from an initial
value of 20% to a ﬁnal value of 21% at the end of the measurement.

3 Stability test of straws : Experiment II

The goal of the second experiment was to verify whether the degradation in
the gain of the straw tube detector is purely due to high irradiation or not. In
order to verify this, gain and energy resolution measurements with two straws,
marked as straw A and straw R are done. These two straws are positioned
adjacent to one another. The idea is to use one straw as a reference detector
(marked as R) and the other one as the detector under aging study (marked
as A) such that there will be a much higher amount of charge accumulated on
straw A than on straw R, after operating both the straws for a long duration.
To study the performance, gain and energy resolution of both the straws are
measured continuously and simultaneously at equal intervals of time.

3.1 Experimental set up

An identical experimental setup as mentioned in Section 2.1 is made to mea-
sure the gain and energy resolution of both the straws. The straws are con-
nected to the same gas line such that any external factors aﬀecting the per-
formance of the straws cancel out when we take the ratio of any measured
quantity of the two straws such as gain or energy resolution. The same Fe55
X-ray source is used to irradiate both the straws. The radiation over straw
R was purposely kept at low rates just to use it as a reference detector to
monitor the gas gain continuously and compare at ﬁxed time intervals with
the gain of straw A. The particle rate from the source exposed to the straws
is adjusted by using a perspex collimator. The count rates as measured by
the scalar in case of straw A and straw R are 35 kHz/mm and 0.09 kHz/mm
respectively. The biasing voltage of straw A and straw R are kept at 1550 V
and 1450 V respectively. The reference straw, i.e., straw R is operated at
lower gains ∼6000 and lower radiation, whereas the straw under aging i.e.,
straw A is operated at high gains ∼13000. This is done to achieve a higher
amount of accumulated charge on straw A in comparatively lesser amount of
time, whereas operating straw R at a low gain is done to minimise the amount
of charge accumulation on it. So the expectation is that the ratio of the gains
of the two straws will normalise all the eﬀects due to external parameters on
the gas gain such as, ambient temperature, pressure, relative humidity and gas

7

ﬂow rate, except the eﬀect of radiation which is diﬀerent for both the straws.
The energy spectra from straw A and straw R are simultaneously stored at
regular intervals of time such that there is no time lag in between, with the
help of two separate MCA modules. The detector characteristics such as gain
and energy resolution are extracted from the Fe55 X-ray spectra using the
same method as discussed in Section 2.1.

Figure 7: Gain and T/p as a function of time for both the straws. The bias voltage
of Straw A and R are 1550 V and 1450 V respectively.

3.2 Results

The variation of the gain and the energy resolution of both the straws over
time is plotted in Fig. 7 and Fig. 10 respectively. Fig. 7 and Fig. 10 also
show the variation of T/p that was also recorded throughout the experiment.
There is a gradual decrease in the gain of straw A with time as observed in
Fig. 7. However no such degradation in gain is observed for straw R. Whereas

of 11 % in the absolute gain at gas ﬂow rate of 0.02 l/hr. Then the gas ﬂow
rate was increased to ∼ 0.13 l/hr at around time 100 hr, to check if the gain
restores to its original value or not. In Fig. 8, the normalised gain of straw A,
viz. the instantaneous gain (gain) over the initial gain (gaint0 = 13000) and
T/p is plotted as a function of time from the time instant the gas ﬂow rate
was increased. The time varying normalised gain is ﬁtted by a function:
f (t) = p0(1 − p1e− t
p2 )

(6)

where p0, p1 are constants, t is the time in hr, and p2 is the time constant of
the function.

Figure 9: Normalised gain and T/p as a function of time (here t=0 hr means t=600
hr of the actual measurement).

From this ﬁt it is seen that the gain restores to 96 % of its original value
in 3.62 hrs of continuous gas ﬂow at a rate of 0.13 l/hr. T/p was constant
through out this time as can be seen from Fig. 8 so the gain was not needed
to be normalised by the T/p eﬀect. After a few hours, the gas ﬂow rate was
again reset to a value ∼ 0.03 l/hr and the measurement continued. The high
voltage is kept ON and the source is not removed from its original position.
We observed that the gain of straw A continuously decreased from 13000 to
10000 viz. 80% of the original value of gain. We again increased the gas ﬂow
rate to a value of 0.8 l/hr at around time ∼ 600 hr, and observed an increase
in the normalised gain as shown in Fig. 9. The normalised gain is ﬁtted with
the same function as in eqn. 6. From the ﬁt it is found that the gain increases
from 80% to 87% of its original value in a time duration of 3.15 hrs, but the
gain did not restore to its original value even after ﬂowing the gas at a high
rate for more than 10 hrs. The eﬀect of changing the gas ﬂow rate is also
observed for straw R, but this eﬀect is more prominent for the straw A. There
is an overall slight increase in the gain of straw R which is due to the increase
in T/p with time. For the same reason, there is a decrease in the energy
resolution value of straw R from 25 % to 23 % as shown in Fig. 10. However,
it can be seen from Fig. 10 that the energy resolution of straw A increases

that the energy resolution of straw A does not improve on increasing the gas
ﬂow rate. This may indicate the performance degradation of the straw at high
radiation environment.

bias voltage of straw A and R are 1550 V and 1450 V respectively.

accumulated per unit length of straw A.

To understand the eﬀect of high radiation alone on the degradation in
the gain of the straw tube detector, we took the ratio of the gains of the
straws and normalised it by the ratio of the initial gains. As changes in
temperature, pressure, relative humidity and gas ﬂow rate will aﬀect both the
straws similarly therefore, the ratio of the two gains can properly express the
long term eﬀect of the radiation only on the straw under aging study.

indicates degradation of gain in straw A because of high rate of radiation.

4 Measurement of Time resolution

Since straw tubes may be used for tracking in several upcoming high energy
physics experiments so it is important to study its timing properties. The
time resolution of a gaseous detector depends on the gas mixture and applied
voltage or electric ﬁeld of the detector.
It is actually the measure of the
ﬂuctuation in the time required for the electrons to drift along the electric
ﬁeld lines towards the anode wire. For wire chambers, the time resolution is
usually of the order of a few ns.

Figure 12: Schematic of the electronics setup for time resolution measurement of
the straw tube detector.

The time resolution of the straw tube detector is measured with premixed
Ar/CO2 gas in the 70:30 volume ratio. Two plastic scintillator detectors are
used to generate the 2-fold trigger signals with cosmic rays. The photomulti-
pliers coupled to the scintillators are biased with a voltage of + 1550 V. The
signals from the scintillators are fed to a Leading Edge Discriminator (LED)
with a threshold of - 50 mV. The 2-fold coincidence signal is used as the ‘start’
signal for the Time to Amplitude Convertor (TAC). The TAC is set at 10 µsec
full scale range. The straw signal after passing through the preampliﬁer is fed
to a Timing Single Channel Analyser (TSCA) which gives a TTL logic out-
put. This TTL signal is converted to NIM signal using TTL-NIM adapter
module and the NIM output signal is used as the ‘stop’ signal for TAC. The
time diﬀerence between the ‘start’ and the ‘stop’ signal gets converted to am-
plitude in the TAC and the output is fed to the MCA for obtaining a timing
spectrum. The schematic electronics setup for timing measurement is shown
in Fig. 12. Fig. 13 shows a typical time spectrum of a straw tube detector at
1750 V. The spectrum is ﬁtted with a Gaussian function. The mean of the

The sigma of this distribution is the eﬀective/combined time resolution of the
straw tube and trigger detectors. Therefore using the relation:

where σ2
ef f is the eﬀective time resolution of the combined detector setup, σ1
and σ2 are the time resolution of trigger scintillator Sc1 and scintillator Sc2
respectively, the time resolution of straw tube detector is extracted. The time
resolution of the trigger scintillators were measured independently and the
values of σ1 and σ2 were found out to be (0.38 ± 0.01) ns and (0.56 ± 0.01) ns
respectively. The time resolution are measured for diﬀerent voltage settings.
The variation of the time resolution (σ) and the time diﬀerence as a function of
voltage is shown in Fig. 14. It is observed that the time resolution decreases
with increasing voltage. The best achieved time resolution of straw tube
detectors in our experiment using cosmic rays as the trigger is found to be

From the ﬁrst experiment, we concluded that the gain reduction by 9.6%
per C/cm after a total charge accumulation of 0.6 C/cm wire on the straw
might be due to continuous and high radiation intensity. The observed aging
In the second experiment, we conﬁrmed
rate is small but not negligible.
that aging occurred due to the high radiation intensity and also drawn a
conclusion on the dependence of this aging rate on the gas ﬂow rate. It takes
about 3 hrs time for the gain of a continuously irradiated straw to partially
restore after increasing the gas ﬂow rate. The transient nature of the aging is
proven by the fact that the gain tends to restore as we increase the gas ﬂow
rate, but after a very long term exposure to radiation, we observe that the
gain degrades continuously. The gain did not restore to its initial value even
after ﬂowing the gas at a very high rate through the straw chambers for a
long time. This means that there is some aging due to long term operation
of the straw tube detectors which was not observed in case of accelerated
aging measurements reported in references [9, 8]. Therefore this needs further
detailed investigation. For Ar/CO2 gas mixture operated at high rates over
long time periods, a gradual decomposition of CO2 can occur and the resulting
pure carbon can be deposited at the cathode [20]. An important observation
in both the experiments is that the gain degradation of the straw tube detector
starts immediately from the time of operation under high intensity radiation.
The degradation is slow and gradual. Another conclusion that can be drawn
from our experiment is that the straw tubes can be safely operated at low
radiation intensities (∼ 0.1 kHz/mm) and at low gas ﬂow rates (∼ 0.02 l/hr)
(as no aging observed in straw R of experiment 2) and at high radiation
intensities (∼ 40 kHz/mm) at high gas ﬂow rates (>3 l/hr) (since slight gain
reduction observed even after 800 hr of operation of the straws in experiment
1). A systematic study of the aging rates at diﬀerent radiation intensities, gas
gains and gas ﬂow rates will be carried out in the future to ﬁx the operating
conditions of the straws in the real experiment.
The time resolution of the straw tube detector is also measured with cosmic
rays. The best achieved time resolution is found to be 14.4±1.6 ns at a biasing
voltage of 1900 V.
