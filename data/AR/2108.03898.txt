ABSTRACT

Context. Recent observations of dust ejections from active asteroids, including (3200) Phaethon, have drawn considerable interest
from planetary astronomers studying the generation and removal of small dust particles on asteroids.
Aims. In this work, we aim to investigate the importance of thermal radiation pressure from asteroid regolith (AR) acting on small
dust particles over the surface of the AR. In particular, we aim to understand the role of thermal radiation in the near-Sun environment.
Methods. We describe the acceleration of particles over the AR within the radiation ﬁelds (direct solar, reﬂected (scattered) solar,
and thermal radiation) in addition to the asteroid’s rotation and gravitational ﬁeld. Mie theory is used because the particles of interest
have sizes comparable to thermal wavelengths (∼ 1−100 µm), and thus the geometric approximation is not applicable. A new set of
formalisms is developed for the purpose.
Results. We ﬁnd that the acceleration of particles with spherical radius (cid:46) 1 µm to ∼ 10 µm is dominated by the thermal radiation from
the AR when the asteroid is in the near-Sun environment (heliocentric distance rh (cid:46) 0.8 au). Under thermal radiation dominance, the
net acceleration is towards space, that is, outwards from the AR. This outward acceleration is the strongest for particles of ∼ 1 µm in
radius, regardless of other parameters. A preliminary trajectory integration using the Phaethon-like model shows that such particles
escape from the gravitational ﬁeld within about 10 minutes. Our results are consistent with the previous observational studies on
Phaethon in that the ejected dust particles have a spherical radius of ∼ 1 µm.

1. Introduction

Recent discoveries of active asteroids (reviewed in, e.g., Jewitt
2012) and the paucity of small dust particles on the Hayabusa2
target asteroid (162173) Ryugu (Grott et al. 2019) have drawn
considerable interest from planetary astronomers studying the
generation and removal of small (submillimeter; subm(mm) dust
particles. Centimeter(cm)-sized particles were observed being
ejected from the asteroid (101955) Bennu (Lauretta et al. 2019),
and later their orbits were physically modeled (McMahon et al.
2020). Also, the near-Sun asteroid (3200) Phaethon, the tar-
get body of the JAXA DESTINY+ mission (Arai et al. 2018),
is a symbolic asteroid, as recurrent dust ejections have been
witnessed through telescopic observations around its perihelion
over the past decade (Jewitt & Li 2010; Jewitt et al. 2013; Hui &
Li 2017).

From observations,

the eﬀective radius of the particles
ejected from Phaethon is estimated to be as small as ∼ 1 µm
(Jewitt et al. 2013; Hui & Li 2017). Although the generation
mechanism of such small particles has been thoroughly studied
in terms of thermal fracturing in an astronomical context (Jewitt
& Li 2010; Delbo et al. 2014; Molaro et al. 2017), the mecha-
nism responsible for accelerating and ejecting these dust parti-
cles around the perihelion remains unexplored.

likely diﬀer because of the large size diﬀerence of the particles
(cm and µm) and the fact that Phaethon showed recurrent activ-
ity near its perihelion. Phaethon is an important object because it
is the only object with detectable recurrent dust ejection. There
have been questions such as whether Phaethon’s dust ejections
near perihelion can explain the total mass of the Geminid me-
teor stream (Blaauw 2017; Ryabova 2017; Jewitt et al. 2019).
Such questions can be discussed more systematically once the
dust ejection mechanisms are known. The aim of this work is to
ﬁnd a mechanism able to explain many of the observations of
Phaethon’s activity, at least to some degree.

When an asteroid comes close to the Sun, the surface is
heated by solar radiation. At a heliocentric distance of 0.2 au,
the maximum surface temperature reaches ∼ 900 K. Along the
terminator on a near-Sun asteroid, the rapid heating or cooling
may induce severe stress on the surface material (Molaro et al.
2017), which will lead to thermal fracturing, as demonstrated in
laboratory experiments (Delbo et al. 2014). Accordingly, small
dust particles may be generated on the asteroid surface (Jewitt
& Li 2010). Meteorites are the most direct sources with which
to infer the size of such small particles. Studies have found me-
teoritic matrix particles with sizes down to 0.01−5 µm (Scott &
Krot 2005; Righter et al. 2006), which suggests that dust parti-
cles of ∼ 1 µm or smaller could be present on asteroids.

In this context, the ﬁrst question to tackle is that regarding
the unknown mechanism responsible for ejecting such particles
from asteroids. The mechanisms on Bennu and Phaethon may

Applications of thermal radiation pressure in similar contexts
are presented in McMahon et al. (2020) (see Lauretta et al. 2019

2017). However, the formalisms in those works are applicable
only to large particles (geometric regime) at large initial height
(typically around 10 m). Using the formalism, McMahon et al.
(2020) found that particles with initial speed < 10 cm/s cannot
escape from Bennu.

In this work, we consider small stationary particles (radius
0.5 to tens of microns) at a small height of the order of 1 cm
above the asteroid regolith (AR) without any initial speed. Our
results demonstrate that neither initial thrust nor large initial
height are essential for such small particles to be accelerated and
escape into space in the near-Sun environment.

2. Methods

A particle ﬂoating above the AR experiences the following
forces: direct solar radiation, indirect solar radiation reﬂected
(scattered) on AR, thermal radiation from AR, and the gravity of
the asteroid. The acceleration vectors associated to these are de-
noted a(cid:12), aref, ather, and agrav, respectively. In addition to gravity,
the centrifugal term (acen) is included if we choose a non-inertial
rotating frame on the asteroid. The net radiative acceleration is
deﬁned such that arad = a(cid:12) + ather + aref. The net acceleration is
the sum of all accelerations, atotal = arad +(agrav +acen). Here, ather
and aref are directed outward from the AR, while a(cid:12) is usually
directed inward. The timescale of interest, for example the time
required for a particle to leave the asteroid’s gravitational ﬁeld, is
assumed to be short compared to the asteroid’s orbital timescale,
and hence the orbital motion of the asteroid is not considered.

2.1. Problem statement

In this work, we aim to calculate the net acceleration acting on
a particle that is placed above the AR at an initial height of H.
The way in which we achieve this initial condition is discussed
in Sect. 4.3; it is taken as granted for the modeling in this work.
To physically handle this problem with manageable complexity,
the following assumptions are used.

The particle is a homogeneous sphere of radius ra with a
known refractive index. The condition of height, H (cid:29) ra, should
be satisﬁed all the time. Then any radiations from AR can be
approximated as a plane wave (similar to solar irradiation), ig-
noring the curvature of the particle. Therefore, the Mie theory
(Lorenz–Mie theory) is applicable.

Under the Mie scattering theory (see Bohren & Huﬀman
1998, chapter 4), the eﬀective cross section for radiative pres-
sure is calculated for a given particle size, refractive index, and
wavelength (Sects. 2.3). If the spectrum of the incident radiation
is known, the radiation pressure and acceleration are calculated
by integrating the contribution from all wavelengths.

Throughout this work, AR is assumed as a Lambertian scat-
terer. Although more comprehensive models are available (e.g.,
Hapke 2012), they would introduce multiple new free parame-
ters, while the Lambertian scattering is a good approximation to
the complicated scattering process.

The calculation of thermal radiation from AR requires the
temperature distribution on the AR to be known a priori. For this,
a smooth spherical asteroid with a 1D thermal conduction model
is adopted to calculate the temperature of the AR (see Sect. 2.2).
By combining the assumptions mentioned above, a simple
set of descriptions of forces is established. In the following sec-
tions, we describe how the AR surface temperature TS is ob-
tained using thermal modeling, how the Mie theory is applied to
calculate the radiative accelerations, and a detailed set of deriva-
tions of the formalisms used throughout this work. Justiﬁcations

of selected parameter values used in this work are then provided.
Finally, we outline a simple way to compare the magnitudes of
solar and thermal radiations based on the developed formalism.

2.2. Thermal modeling

The surface temperature of an asteroid is necessary for estimat-
ing ather. The surface temperature is calculated by the so-called
thermo-physical model (TPM). In this section, we describe the
outline of the widely used scheme (Spencer et al. 1989; Delbo
2004; Mueller 2007) adopted in this work. A reparameterization
of the problem is then summarized; this is used throughout the
present work.

In the scheme, the following classic 1D thermal conduc-
tion equation (Fourier’s equation) on the surface is solved under
proper boundary conditions:

ρcs

∂T
∂t

= κ

∂2T
∂z2

.

(1)

Here, ρ, cs, and κ denote the material mass density, the speciﬁc
heat at constant pressure, and the thermal conductivity, respec-
tively. T is the temperature of the topmost cell in the simulation
(we refer to this as the AR surface temperature), t is the time,
and z is the depth (Spencer et al. 1989; Mueller 2007). This con-
duction equation is solved by two boundary conditions: (i) the
energy at the AR surface is balanced between the incident so-
lar radiation energy, the subsurface conduction energy, and the
radiative emission energy; and (ii) the temperature gradient van-
ishes at inﬁnite depth (limz→∞ ∂T (z, t)/∂z = 0). The ﬁrst bound-
ary condition (i) is solved via the forward time-centered space
scheme following the above-mentioned references. The emis-
sivity used in (i) must match with the emissivity (cid:15)S (λ) to be
used in the ather calculation below. The “inﬁnite depth” in the
second condition (ii) is set to ten times the thermal skin depth
lS = (cid:112)
κProt/(2πρcs), where Prot is the rotational period of the
asteroid (following, e.g., Spencer et al. 1989; Mueller 2007). The
Sun is assumed as a point source, although it can be as large as
∼ 2.5◦ at 0.2 au.

The modeled asteroid is assumed to be a smooth sphere; that
is, any roughness and large-scale geological structures are ig-
nored. There are a few advantages of ignoring roughness. First,
the model is mostly described by the thermal parameter (Eq. (6))
except for the heliocentric distance and pole orientation. Thus,
the discussions become analytically simple. An example is the
eﬀect of the rotational period and thermal inertia, as described
below Eq. (6). Second, a direct comparison with other theoret-
ical studies such as Ravaji et al. (2019) is possible as they also
used smooth spherical asteroids (see Sect. 4.3). Consideration
of roughness (self-heating, shadowing, and/or 3D conduction) is
computationally demanding and increases the dimensionality of
the parameter space enormously.

The rotational period Prot is assumed to be signiﬁcantly
shorter than the orbital one. Thermal equilibrium is therefore
reached at each ﬁxed heliocentric distance, and the seasonal ef-
fect is neglected. To calculate the AR surface temperature, an
initial condition of T (z) = Teqme−z/lS
is set for depth z at the
local noon for a given latitude, where Teqm is deﬁned below in
= 50 rotations, and
Eq (2). This array is then evolved for Nmin
iter
the rotation is further repeated until either the speciﬁed temper-
ature stability of ∼ 10−5 K is reached at the surface or the itera-
tion reaches 5000. It is conﬁrmed that Nmin
iter changes the surface
temperature by (cid:28) 0.1 K, given Nmin
iter > 10. The resulting tem-
perature along the longitude and depth during the last rotation

Yoonsoo P. Bach and Masateru Ishiguro: Thermal radiation pressure on asteroids

becomes the temperature of the AR. If the Sun does not rise at
a given latitude, the surface temperature is ﬁxed to 0 K for all
longitudes. The temperature is calculated for patches with a res-
olution of 1◦ in both latitude and longitude. From these gridded
values of the surface temperature, the temperature at an arbi-
trary position on the asteroid is calculated by linear interpolation
(RectBivariateSpline of scipy without smoothing factor).
Equation (1) implies that there exists a set of eﬀective ρ, cs,
and κ —and sometimes including the porosity factor— that de-
scribes the realistic regolith. It is further assumed that ρ, cs, and
κ, and thus thermal inertia (Γ := √
κρcs), are independent of
temperature (see Sect. 4.2 for further discussion). The thermal
inertia has the unit of tiu ≡ J m−2 K−1 s−1/2. The notation “tiu”
stands for “thermal inertia unit”, ﬁrst coined by Putzig (2006).

All equations used in TPM are then ﬁnally solved by spec-
ifying the spin vector and two parameters. The ﬁrst parameter
is Teqm, the equilibrium temperature at the subsolar point of a
non-rotating asteroid or a plate:

The variables used in this equation are explained as follows.

is a constant for an AR model, and ¯(cid:15)S is the spectrum-averaged

perature TS , deﬁned in Eq. (10). Conventionally, ¯(cid:15)S is ﬁxed as a
constant. It is ﬁxed to 0.90 in this work. As AB (cid:28) 1 and ¯(cid:15)S ∼ 1,
the constant cT ≈ 1. The temperature

2.3. Mie calculation

Mie theory requires (A) a homogeneous spherical particle and
(B) plane parallel incident electromagnetic waves (see, e.g.,
Bohren & Huﬀman 1983). It then enables us to calculate the ra-
diation pressure coeﬃcient Qpr = Qpr(λ, ra|Ia) once the refrac-
tive index is known. Here, Ia stands for the information on the
particle, the refractive index. The radiation pressure experienced
by the particle is proportional to Qprσ, as well as the incident
irradiance. If the extinction and scattering coeﬃcients (Qext and
Qsca, respectively) are given, then Qpr is calculated as
Qpr = Qext − Qsca(cid:104)cos ϑ(cid:105) ,

(7)

where ϑ is the scattering angle. The second term (Qsca multiplied
by the so-called asymmetry factor, (cid:104)cos ϑ(cid:105)) takes only the mo-
mentum transferred towards the propagation direction (see e.g.,
Sect 2.3 of van de Hulst 1981 and Sect. 4.5 of Bohren & Huﬀ-
man 1983). Each term in the equation can be calculated once the
particle radius ra and refractive index are found using Mie the-
ory. For large particles (ra (cid:29) λ), a geometric limit is expected:
Qpr → 1.

For the optical indices, two well-studied materials are con-
sidered, namely olivine and magnetite. The former is transpar-
ent and the latter is opaque material in optical wavelengths. The
optical indices are directly adopted from previous experimental
works: low-Fe olivine (Mg1.9Fe0.1SiO4; Fabian et al. 20011) and
magnetite (Fe3O4; Triaud, A. H. M. J.2; Mutschke, H. (2021),
private comm.). Although they are not representative materials
in the real AR compared to mixtures like meteoritic samples, our
model can easily be extended to any real material with a known
refractive index. These materials are chosen because the refrac-
tive indices are accurately known. The calculated Qpr(λ, ra) val-
ues for these two materials are given in Appendix A.

For the requirement (B) to hold, an assumption H (cid:29) ra is
needed such that the solid angle of the particle viewed from an
inﬁnitesimal AR patch (∼ σ/H2 = πr2
a/H2) is much smaller than
unity. As shown in Sect. 3, the ra of interest does not exceed a
few tens of microns, and hence an arbitrary choice of H = 1 cm
satisﬁes the requirement.

The TPM calculates the proﬁle of a dimensionless quantity,
T/Teqm, on the AR over time (rotation). This proﬁle is uniquely
determined once the spin vector and Θ are speciﬁed for the
smooth model; converting it to the absolute temperature then re-
quires Teqm. An advantage of assuming a smooth, spherical aster-
oid is that Θ is proportional to Γ/
Prot. Therefore, changing Prot
by a factor of 0.5, for example, is identical to changing Γ to
2Γ
because both Θ and Teqm are not changed by the modiﬁcation
(this fact is used in Sect. 3.4). Only the centrifugal acceleration
must be updated according to Prot.

2.4. Radiative accelerations

To derive the formalism for radiative accelerations, we consider
an arbitrary spectral irradiance (Jλ) from a black body of tem-
perature T , spectrum-averaged emissivity ¯(cid:15), and solid angle dΩ
on the particle from a certain incident direction (Fig 1). For sim-
plicity, we deﬁne a few auxiliary quantities (Appendix B.1):

inated from the direction ˆΩi. A tiny surface patch with an area of dA
reﬂects the solar radiation and emits the thermal radiation to the par-
ticle (the dashed and squiggly arrows, respectively, to the direction of
ˆΩe(cid:48) ) with the emission angle of e(cid:48). In our model, e(cid:48)(cid:48) = e(cid:48) holds because
of the planar surface assumption. The isothermal regolith region (gray
dashed) is assumed to be a circle with a radius of r0((cid:29) H (cid:29) ra). No
radiation outside this region is considered because the patch right below
the particle already ﬁlls most of the ﬁeld of view (r0 (cid:29) H).

is the spectrum-averaged Qpr value, bλ in Eq. (9) is the normal-
ized Planck function, and ¯(cid:15) is the spectrum-averaged emissivity.
Using these parameters, the magnitude of the radiative acceler-
ation on a Mie particle of radius ra and mass density ρm is (Ap-
pendix B.2):

We use the Qpr values calculated in Appendix A to integrate
in Eq. (8). Figure 2 shows the calculated ¯Qpr for magnetite and
olivine when (cid:15), and therefore ¯(cid:15), are constants. The trend that
¯Qpr → 1 as ra (cid:29) λ (i.e., the geometric optics regime) is clearly
seen in Fig. 2. For olivine, the optical index is measured sepa-
rately for three polarization directions with respect to the crys-
talline axis orientations. (Fabian et al. 2001; see Appendix A for
details). The calculated ¯Qpr values in Fig. 2a are, however, nearly
the same for all three cases, at least under the temperatures in
which we are interested (AR temperature of TS ∼ 100−1000 K
and T = T(cid:12) = 5777 K). Thus, the average of the three values is
adopted throughout this work. Magnetite does not have multiple
optical indices, because of its simple symmetric (face-centered
cubic) structure.

¯Qpr values are calculated in the range of ra

vals to 1000 µm) and TS ∈ [10, 1300] K (with 1 K interval) for
both magnetite and olivine. The ¯Qpr values are then linearly in-
terpolated when necessary. Figure 2 shows ¯Qpr values with re-
spect to ra for ﬁxed T .

2.4.1. Solar radiation a(cid:12)

Fig. 2. Calculated Qpr value averaged over blackbody spectra of dif-
ferent temperatures ( ¯Qpr in our notation). The ¯Qpr values are plotted as
a function of the particle size ra and blackbody temperature T of the
incident radiation for two minerals: a, olivine and b, magnetite. The
emissivity (cid:15) is assumed to be constant, so ¯(cid:15) = (cid:15) cancels out in Eq. (9).
For olivine, three polarization directions with respect to the crystalline
axes can lead to small diﬀerences in the results (three diﬀerent markers;
see Appendix A), and the average value (solid line) is used in this work.
¯Qpr converges to unity for a large particle limit, as predicted from the
geometrical optics approximation.

The solar radiation is assumed as a perfect blackbody in this
work, so ¯(cid:15)(cid:12) = (cid:15) = 1. a(cid:12) decreases as r−2
h as the solar irradi-
ance decreases. For the Sun, we use the notation ¯Qpr,(cid:12)(ra) :=
¯Qpr(ra, T = T(cid:12)).

Because a(cid:12) is oriented in the anti-solar direction, a(cid:12) is in the
inward direction on the dayside of the asteroid. When the particle
goes behind the shadow of the asteroid, we regard a(cid:12) = 0.

2.4.2. Reﬂected solar radiation aref

For a reﬂected (scattered) component of the acceleration, the ra-
diative acceleration contributed from each inﬁnitesimal surface
patch in the ﬁeld of view must be integrated. After proper in-
tegration (Appendix B.3), the acceleration from a Lambertian
scattering AR is derived as

because it plays an important role in the trajectory integration
(Sect. 4.4) when H (cid:38) r0. Because AB (cid:28) 1 for many asteroids,
one obtains aref (cid:28) a(cid:12) as expected.

From the formula, we see that ather is very sensitive to the AR
temperature TS . Also, it is linearly proportional to ¯Qpr, which
implies the importance of the adequate Mie calculation, espe-
cially for small particles (when ¯Qpr deviates signiﬁcantly from
unity).

2.4.4. Comparing a(cid:12) and ather

To compare the z-axis components of a(cid:12) in Eq. (12) and ather in
Eq. (15), we re-formulated ather using Eqs. (2) and (12):

where RQ(ra, TS ) := ¯Qpr(ra, TS )/ ¯Qpr,(cid:12)(ra) is the relative eﬃcacy
of the thermal radiation from the AR compared to the solar radi-
ation. In other words, it can be understood as the ratio of eﬀective
cross-sectional areas of the particle exposed to the spectrum of
temperature TS and T(cid:12). The ratio of the two acceleration mech-
anisms along the z-axis is then given by

Here, a(cid:12),z = a(cid:12)µi.

If the thermal inertia Γ = 0, the surface temperature is the
same as the equilibrium temperature, TS = Teqm. This is the
case for the near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM; Harris
1998) for example, with the beaming parameter of unity. Thus,
the ratio in Eq. (17) stays constant during rotation of the aster-
oid for Γ = 0 unless µi vanishes. In reality, however, this ratio
changes over the local time. In particular, it increases towards the
evening terminator. This is because TS does not cool immedi-
ately like NEATM (Sect. 3.1), and so TS > Teqmµ1/4
. Therefore,
one would expect ather to dominate a(cid:12) in the afternoon under
TPM, which is a more realistic version of NEATM. This is a key
point in the motivation of the present study.

where ρM is the bulk mass density of the asteroid (not necessarily
equal to the mass density of grains ρm; likely ρM < ρm due to the
bulk porosity), and D is the asteroid diameter. The gravitational
acceleration is directed inward from the AR. Figure 5 of Jewitt
(2012) can be reproduced by comparing agrav in Eq. (18) with a(cid:12)
in Eq. (12).

The last remaining acceleration component is a ﬁctitious
one, namely the centrifugal acceleration. This is introduced only
when describing the net acceleration of the particle from an ob-
server sitting on the AR (i.e., in the rotating frame on the as-
teroid). The centrifugal acceleration on the equator is calculated
from

for the asteroid’s rotational period Prot. In the main part of this
work, acen is taken into account for calculating the eﬀective grav-
ity by (agrav + acen) · ˆr = agrav − acen. As we are considering an
initially stationary particle with respect to the observer, the Cori-
olis force is zero.

2.6. Parameter selection of model asteroids

For ﬁctitious model asteroids, two aspect angles (the angle be-
tween the spin vector and the asteroid–Sun vector) are consid-
ered, namely, 90◦ and 45◦, which are called the “perpendicular”
and “aspect 45◦” models in this work, respectively. It is assumed
that the ﬁducial model asteroids are located at a heliocentric dis-
tance of rh = 0.2 au, that is, in the near-Sun environment. We
further changed it from 0.1 to 2 au for test cases (25 equally
spaced rh values in logarithmic scale by rh = 10k(log10 20)/24−1 au
for integer k = 0 to 24). Fiducial asteroids have smooth spher-
ical shapes with D = 1 km, and for test cases, D ranges from
0.1 to 80 km (50 equally spaced D values in logarithmic scale
by D = 10k(log10 800)/49−1 km for integer k = 0 to 49). For S, B,
and C-type asteroids, the bulk mass density ρM ∼ 2660 ± 1290,
2190 ± 1000, and 1570 ± 1380 kg/m3, respectively (Carry 2012).
Therefore, as a simplifying assumption, the model asteroids
have a ﬁxed ρM = 2000 kg/m3. The Bond albedo is ﬁxed at
AB = 0.05, a typical value for an asteroid with pV ∼ 0.1−0.2 us-
ing Eq. (3). The rotation period of the ﬁducial model is also ﬁxed
to Prot = 6 h, a representative value of the asteroids in the size
range (Warner et al. 2009, updated in 20203); the Prot value has
almost no eﬀect on these preliminary results when it is changed
by a factor of two (see Sect. 3.4). The thermal inertia is taken
as 200 tiu (a typical value for asteroids of a similar size range in
Delbo et al. 2015).

All the above-mentioned parameters are summarized in Ta-
ble 1 (Model asteroids columns). The surface temperatures of
these asteroids are calculated by solving the 1D heat conduction
equation using these parameters (Sect. 2.2).

2.7. Selection of particle parameters
The particles have mass densities of ρm = 3000 kg/m3 following
previous works on dust ejection or electrostatic dust lofting sim-
ulations (e.g., Li & Jewitt 2013; Jewitt et al. 2013; Senshu et al.
2015; Hui & Li 2017; Orger et al. 2018). The assumed mass
density ρm is close to the (25143) Itokawa sample (3400 kg/m3
Tsuchiyama et al. 2011). The particles are assumed to be homo-
geneous4 and spherical, and placed on the surface (at a height of
H = 1 cm over the surface). The radiation pressure coeﬃcient
(Qpr) is obtained from Mie theory (Sect. 2.3).

We do not consider microporosity (φ) in this work. If φ is
to be introduced, the particle density ρm must be updated to
(1 − φ)ρm, but the Mie theory (Sect. 2.3) still applies if the
particle is still assumed to be homogeneous. The radiative ac-
celerations are then aﬀected linearly: a(cid:12), aref and ather (Eqs.
12, 13, 15, respectively) have the simple identical ρ−1
m depen-
dency, and hence the net radiative acceleration will be scaled as
arad ∝ ρ−1

m ∝ (1 − φ)−1.

3. Results

3.1. Temperature proﬁle on asteroids

To test the validity of our TPM calculation, a few temperature
proﬁles over time were generated and compared with previous
works (e.g., Mueller 2007, Figure 2.2), and the code passed the
tests. Temperature proﬁles in Fig. 3 resemble some representa-
tive ones from ﬁctitious model asteroids and Phaethon used in
this work. The thermal inertia diﬀerence does not induce large
temperature proﬁle changes during the day compared to the night
(for the physical reasons, see Sect. 4.2).

The nighttime temperature increases signiﬁcantly as thermal
inertia. Also, the nighttime temperatures for perpendicular and
aspect 45◦ models are very similar, although they diﬀer consid-
erably in the daytime. Therefore, it is expected that ather ∝ T 4
S
would be insensitive to the aspect angle at night. The largest ther-

mal inertias are the ﬁducial values corrected by the temperature
dependency (Sect. 4.2).

3.2. Components of acceleration

The resultant radiative acceleration components for ra = 2 µm
olivine and magnetite particles on the equator of the ﬁducial
model asteroid (D = 1 km) are shown in Fig. 4. Here we see
that, especially at the evening side, the thermal component, ather,
dominates the total radiative acceleration, arad. At night, arad · ˆr is
larger than the threshold (cid:107)(agrav +acen)· ˆr(cid:107), that is, the particles are
accelerated outwards from the AR. The diﬀerence between these
curves of olivine and magnetite comes from the diﬀerence in the
refractive indices (Sect. 2.3 and Appendix A), which makes ¯Qpr
diﬀerent (Fig. 2).

The sharp spike of arad · ˆr at the evening terminator is caused
by the sudden quench of the solar radiation near the termina-
tor (when the particle enters the shadow behind the asteroid). In
the computation, a(cid:12) is not turned oﬀ until it reaches this shadow
even though its footprint reached the longitude of 270◦, but this
lag is invisible due to the small height H = 1 cm. The reﬂected
component aref turns oﬀ right after Sunset, that is, when the
footprint of the particle is in shadow, regardless of the particle’s
height.

3.3. Acceleration over local time

Similar to Fig. 4, the net radiative accelerations arad · ˆr for var-
ious particle radius ra on diﬀerent asteroids are given in Fig. 5.
The ﬁducial model asteroid (D = 1 km) and the Phaethon-like
model (Table 1) are considered. These ﬁgures indicate that par-
ticles with radii from ra < 1 to ra ∼ 10 µm tend to have larger
accelerations outwards from AR. This holds for both our ﬁducial
model asteroids (D = 1 km) and for Phaethon (D = 5.1 km).

4 The compact material density (the density when microporosity is
zero) is ∼ 3, 200 kg/m3 for forsterite (non-Fe olivine; Mg2SiO4),
∼ 4, 400 kg/m3
fayalite (non-Mg olivine; Fe2SiO4), and ∼
5, 200 kg/m3 for iron (II, III) oxide (pure Fe3O4; all densities from
Robie & Bethke (1962)). The adopted density ρm = 3000 kg/m3 can
therefore be understood as a homogeneously porous sphere with certain
microporosity in the Mie theory.

for

As mentioned in Sect. 3.1, the thermal inertia uncertainty
does not induce a large uncertainty in arad · ˆr during the day
compared to the night. The diﬀerence is small between the per-
pendicular (solid) and aspect 45◦ models (dashed), especially at
night. The cause of the inward acceleration of the 1 µm olivine
particle is given in Sect. 4.1.

inertia values: black lines for Γ = 0, light blue lines for ﬁducial value for model asteroids and Phaethon (Table 1), and red lines for the values

eﬀective gravity taking the centrifugal acceleration into account (solid). The absolute value of a(cid:12) · ˆr is used as it is negative. Both a(cid:12) and aref turn
oﬀ almost immediately after Sunset, which causes the spiky feature of arad · ˆr at longitude of 270◦. ather persists throughout the night thanks to
nonzero thermal inertia.

3.4. Conditions for outward acceleration

In this section, the ﬁctitious model asteroids are used to inves-
tigate the eﬀects of some parameters. First, the eﬀect of helio-
centric distance rh is vital to testing whether the outward dust
acceleration is a phenomenon appearing universally on any as-
teroid or if it happens only in the near-Sun environment. Also,
the eﬀect of asteroid size D and rotational period Prot give hints
as to whether the likelihood of losing small particles is depen-
dent on the asteroid’s size and rotation. Here, these parameters
are investigated by simulating the particles on ﬁctitious asteroids

of varying D, aspect angle, and Prot, at several rh. Two particle
types (magnetite and olivine) are investigated for varying radius
ra.

The total radial acceleration at the initial state, that is, a
stationary particle at height H = 1 cm above the AR, is ex-
pressed as a function of D and ra at given rh by atotal · ˆr =
arad · ˆr + (agrav + acen) · ˆr. The maximum of atotal · ˆr along the
equator is then found and plotted as a function of (D, ra) for a
few selected models (aspect angle, rotational period) and helio-
centric distances, as in Fig. 6.

Fig. 5. Radial accelerations on the equatorial surface at heights of H = 1 cm, for the corresponding particle radius ra with respect to longitude.
The net radial radiative accelerations (arad · ˆr) are shown. The black horizontal lines show the gravity and the eﬀective gravity as in Fig. 4. a, c,
olivine; b, d, magnetite. Panels a and b are calculated for ﬁducial perpendicular (solid) and aspect 45◦ (dashed) model asteroids (D = 1 km) at the
heliocentric distance rh = 0.2 au for given particle radii ra in the legend. For the perpendicular model, the 25 % ambiguity in the thermal inertia
(Γ = 200 ± 50 tiu) is expressed as shading. Panels c and d are calculated for Phaethon using the nominal physical parameter values (Table 1) at
the perihelion. The shading signiﬁes the uncertainty range in the thermal inertia (Γ = 600 ± 200 tiu, Hanuš et al. 2018) of Phaethon. From these
ﬁgures, it is obvious that most of (cid:46) 10 µm-sized particles are accelerated outwards from the AR.

From the ﬁgure, the maximum of atotal · ˆr peaks at ra ≈ 1 µm
for magnetite and at ra ≈ 2−3 µm for olivine. The same trend
must be true for realistic AR materials if they have ¯Qpr and ρm
similar to these particles. There is a general trend that less par-
ticles can achieve outward net acceleration if rh or D increases.
The former is because TS gets smaller as rh increases (thus re-
ducing ather in Eq. (15)), and the latter is because agrav (Eq. (18))
dominates the radial total acceleration.

No large change is visible for models with diﬀerent Prot in
Fig. 6. As mentioned in Sect. 2.2, the temperature on AR after
halving Prot is identical to that when Γ = 200 tiu is updated to
√
2Γ = 283 tiu, because both Θ and Teqm are the same for these
two cases. However, such a small change in Γ does not result
in a large change in the temperature proﬁle at noon in the near-
Sun environment (Fig. 3). As the maximum atotal · ˆr appear near
noon (Fig. 5), it is expected that the change in Prot by a factor
of two will not result in a large change in arad and thus in atotal.
Therefore, the change in Prot does not change the results shown
in Fig. 6 signiﬁcantly.

Comparing the rows in Fig. 6, it is often seen that particles
on Prot = 6 h have slightly greater outward acceleration than
Prot = 3 h. This result may contradict an intuitive prediction
that centrifugal acceleration of a fast rotator is larger than that
of a slow rotator. A change in Θ when changing Prot (as men-

Article number, page 8 of 21

√

tioned above, Prot → 0.5Prot has identical eﬀect as Γ →
2Γ)
slightly changes the maximum temperature as in Fig. 3. Hence,
arad, which is a sensitive function of the temperature (Eq. (15))
is reduced near noon, where the maximum outward acceleration
likely happens. As these two eﬀects take place at the same time,
the contours in Fig. 6 are not necessarily expected to show a
simple trend as a function of Prot.

Also, in Fig. 6, some bumps are seen especially at max{atotal ·
ˆr} = 0 contours around ra ∼ 1 µm. Figure 5a is an example for
understanding the olivine (blue dashed) contour in Fig. 6a. In
the ﬁgure, the location where max{atotal · ˆr} occurs changes from
the evening terminator (when ra (cid:46) 1 µm) to noon (when ra (cid:38)
1.5 µm). Therefore, the olivine contour in Fig. 6a will change its
trend at around ra ∼ 1 µm.

Finally, using the calculated max(atotal · ˆr) values, we con-
strain the diameter of asteroids that can accelerate particles. As
seen in Fig. 6, the condition for diameter gives only the up-
per bound under the parameter space considered in this study,
and hence the maximum diameter is plotted in Fig. 7. The de-
rived maximum diameters of asteroids are smaller for olivine
than magnetite, because olivine is less aﬀected by the thermal
radiation (smaller ¯Qpr(ra, TS )/ ¯Qpr,(cid:12)(ra) in Fig. 2). Also, the clear
trend of decreasing maximum diameter is seen as rh increases,
that is, as the thermal radiation weakens. The proﬁles in Fig. 7

Fig. 7. Maximum diameters of asteroids (D) that produce positive

(rh ∈ [0.1, 2.0] au). The red solid and blue dashed lines are the results

aspect 45◦ models are discriminated by the line thicknesses, and the re-
sults of diﬀerent rotational periods (6 h and 3 h) are discriminated by the
transparency of the lines. The black lines show the slope according to a
power law.

Summarizing the above results in this section, we ﬁnd the
following key points: (1) the thermal radiation becomes crit-
ical as an asteroid approaches the Sun, (2) smaller asteroids
tend to lose particles more easily than larger asteroids, (3) par-
ticles of ra ∼ 1 µm are most eﬃciently accelerated outwards,
and (4) these results are less sensitive to rotational period unless
acen (cid:38) agrav.

3.5. Phaethon

Asteroid (3200) Phaethon is the most appropriate object with
which to test the validity of our model because it has shown ac-
tivity near the perihelion (Jewitt & Li 2010; Li & Jewitt 2013;
Jewitt et al. 2013; Hui & Li 2017) but has not shown lingering ac-
tivity at rh ∼ 1 au (Green et al. 1985; Luu & Jewitt 1992; Cham-
berlin et al. 1996; Hsieh & Jewitt 2005; Wiegert et al. 2008; Je-
witt et al. 2018, 2019). If the recurrent near-perihelion activities
are caused by the same mechanism over time, any model ex-
plaining the phenomenon must coincide with the observations,
in that: (A) Phaethon’s activity (dust ejection) must be stronger
near the perihelion, and (B) the ejected particles must have a
spherical equivalent radius of ra ∼ 1 µm (Jewitt et al. 2013; Hui
& Li 2017).

To test the ability of our model to fulﬁl the requirements, the
maximum atotal · ˆr was found, as in Sect. 3.4, along Phaethon’s
equator. The physical parameters are as given in Table 1. The
results are shown in Fig. 8 as a function of heliocentric dis-
tance rh and particle radius ra for magnetite and olivine. If the
maximum atotal · ˆr on the equator can be a proxy of the likeli-
hood of dust ejection, this ﬁgure tells us that Phaethon should
show the strongest dust ejection near the perihelion. Over time,
as Phaethon’s rh increases (Sect. 4.3.3 and Fig. 11), the likeli-
hood will rapidly drop, and eventually converge to zero when
rh (cid:38) 0.8 au. Therefore, our model satisﬁes the requirement (A).

Fig. 8. Maximum radial acceleration on the Phaethon’s equator. As in
Fig. 6, the maximum acceleration on the equator is calculated for a wide
range of particle sizes (0.5−40 µm) before (a) and after (b) the perihe-
lion passage. The black vertical line corresponds to the Phaethon’s peri-
helion. The numbers on the contour plots are in units of mm/s2, and the
thickness of the contour increases as the acceleration value increases for
ﬁxed contour levels atotal · ˆr = {0, 2, 5, 10, 20} mm/s2. The blue dashed
and red solid lines indicate olivine and magnetite, respectively.

In addition, Fig. 8 indicates that particles of radius from
ra < 1 µm to ra ∼ 2−3 µm are likely to have larger accelerations
outwards from the AR, depending on the material. This is similar
to the results shown in Sects. 3.3 (Fig. 5) and 3.4 (Fig. 6), which
used ﬁctitious model asteroids. Moreover, this is highly consis-
tent with observational studies, as in requirement (B). Therefore,
we conclude that our model satisﬁes the two important require-
ments outlined above and based on previous observational stud-
ies of Phaethon.

The two plots in Fig. 8 (pre- and post-perihelion) appear sim-
ilar because, by coincidence, the aspect angle of Phaethon at per-
ihelion is almost 90◦ (strictly speaking, 101◦). This means the
geometric conﬁguration of the Sun and AR patch on the equator
are nearly time-symmetric with respect to the perihelion.

4. Discussion

4.1. The acceleration peak at ra ∼ 1 µm

In this section, we provide qualitative discussions regarding the
result that ra ∼ 1 µm particles have the largest acceleration.
Larger particles tend to have negative atotal · ˆr values because
gravity dominates atotal, as the area-to-mass-ratio decreases. The
coeﬃcient ¯Qpr plays a key role, especially for small particles. In
Fig. 2, it is seen that RQ = ¯Qpr(TS , ra)/ ¯Qpr,(cid:12)(ra) gets small for
smaller particle sizes. This means that solar radiation dominates
the thermal radiation, and hence the particle is easily pushed into
the AR.

This is why particles of ra ∼ 1 µm tend to experience out-
ward acceleration, while larger or smaller particles tend to ex-
perience weaker, or even inward acceleration (atotal · ˆr < 0).
For olivine, the ratio RQ decreases steeply so that solar radiation
dominates atotal · ˆr during the daytime. For this reason, the olivine
particle of ra = 1 µm in Fig. 5 displays an inward acceleration
during the daytime.

4.2. Effect of thermal inertia Γ

Delbo’ et al. (2007) and Delbo et al. (2015) discuss the eﬀect
of the temperature dependency of Γ. The dependency is caused
mostly by the temperature dependency of the thermal conductiv-
ity, κ. Although Γ must change at each voxel in TPM (depending
on the temperature at each position on the asteroid and depth),
a ﬁrst-order approximation to cope with this temperature depen-
dence is to roughly scale Γ by Γ ∝ T 3/2

or

S ∝ r−3/4

Γ(rh) =

(cid:18) rh

Γ1,

(20)

where Γ1 is the thermal inertia at 1 au (Delbo et al. 2015). In
the present work, the thermal inertia of the model asteroids
is taken to be 200 tiu from the Γ1 values of the similar-sized
asteroids (Delbo et al. 2015, Figure 9). If the asteroids were
placed at rh = 0.2 au, the true eﬀective thermal inertia would
be Γ = 669 tiu following this relationship. Phaethon’s thermal
inertia is also determined at rh ∼ 1 au (Hanuš et al. 2016, 2018),
so the value at its perihelion, rh = 0.14 au, is Γ = 2622 tiu. The
temperature proﬁles using these Γ values are plotted in Fig. 3.

Updating the thermal inertia values of the model asteroids
and Phaethon to these larger values, we obtain Fig. 9. When the
thermal inertia Γ is updated from the ﬁducial value, the morn-
ing and noon temperatures decrease because the heating process
takes longer. On the other hand, the afternoon and night temper-
atures increase because cooling also takes longer, as depicted in
Fig. 3. This implies that the ather for the models with increased
Γ will be larger than ﬁducial models in the afternoon. This eﬀect
is conﬁrmed by comparing Figs. 5 and 9.

where S = 0.1−1 is the ‘cleaness’ parameter and the cohe-
sion force in the original work is divided by particle mass m =

a/3. Thus, an event to break this cohesion force is likely to
have happened to free the particle from the regolith and achieve
the required initial condition H (cid:29) ra. Two such mechanisms are
brieﬂy discussed, and then the implication to Phaethon’s orbit is
discussed.

4.3.1. Thermal fatigue

Ravaji et al. (2019) provided a simple visualization of two (in-
suﬃcient, as they mention, yet useful) criteria to investigate the
probability of thermal fatigue (Figure 5 of their work). First is
∆ ˆTS > 100 K, where ∆ ˆTS is the daily maximum temperature
diﬀerence on the asteroid’s surface, that is, the amplitude of the
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) > 2 K/min,
curves in Fig. 3. The second criterion is
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) is the maximum time-rate of change in surface
where
temperatures, that is, the maximum time derivative of the tem-
perature proﬁle. In the original work, the thermal inertia and
Bond albedo of the asteroids were ﬁxed while rotational period
and heliocentric distance are changed.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)d ˆTS /dt

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)d ˆT s/dt

We devise a similar but more general plot as shown in Fig.
10. This ﬁgure visualizes the likelihood of thermal fatigue on
general small bodies of the Solar System. Taking the Bond
albedo, the emissivity, and the rotational period as free parame-
ters, the two criteria are re-formulated by

For a detailed derivation, see Appendix C.

The ﬁducial perpendicular model and Phaethon have
(cT , Prot) = (1.014, 6 h) and (1.015, 3.604 h), and so the right-
hand side of Eq. (22) is 98.7 [K] and 98.6 [K], respectively. This
criterion can be checked by tracing blue solid contours in Fig.
10. The right-hand side of Eq. (23) becomes 11.8 [K/min] and
7.1 [K/min], respectively (brown dashed contours in Fig. 10).
From the ﬁgure, the ﬁducial model at rh (cid:46) 1.5 au and Phaethon
at rh (cid:46) 0.8 au satisfy both of the criteria, and hence, thermal fa-
tigue is likely to occur in those regions (Region III in the notation
of Ravaji et al. 2019). The probability of the occurrence of the
fracture and the initial size and velocity distribution of the gen-
erated particle are beyond the scope of this work. Previous work
(Jewitt & Li 2010) suggested that thermal expansion potential
energy is translated into kinetic energy and can accelerate the
particle to a certain initial velocity immediately after the thermal
fatigue.

The accelerations shown in this work, such as the radiative ac-
celerations, have a maximum order of < 100 mm/s2. However,
this acceleration is still too small to overcome the cohesion
force of the regolith particles. According to Eq (12) of Hartzell

4.3.2. Electrostatic dust lofting and levitation

The electrostatic lofting mechanism, which is the mechanism
that launches the particles from the AR, has recently been stud-
ied extensively both theoretically (Zimmerman et al. 2016) and

experimentally (Wang et al. 2016; Hood et al. 2018). If small
particles are residing on the rocks by cohesion force, a super-
charging eﬀect near the terminator or the shadow on asteroids
may free the particle from the AR with initial kinetic energy and
achieve the condition H (cid:29) ra.

From Wang et al. (2016) (Figure 4 of them) and Hood et al.
(2018), particles of radius ra = 5−22 µm (2ra = 10−44 µm)
could achieve an initial speed of up to vz,0 ∼ 0.6 m/s due to
the supercharging eﬀect at rh = 1 au. This is the aftermath of
Coulomb interaction, and therefore the particle size range and
initial speed are independent of asteroid size (D) or rh. Thus,
electrostatic dust lofting due to the supercharging eﬀect can
achieve the initial condition (H (cid:29) ra).

It is found that the dust lofting mechanism does not repeat
forever on the asteroid; rather, the dust lofting rate decreases
over time during the experiment (Hood et al. 2018). Therefore,
it is expected that the electrostatic dust lofting will occur only
immediately after the AR is reset, that is, when fresh small par-
ticles are generated by micrometeoritic bombardment or thermal
fatigue.

4.3.3. Phaethon’s orbital movement

As described in Sect. 2.2, the TPM calculates the equilibrium
temperature after rotating the asteroid at least 50 times and ig-
noring seasonal variation. Phaethon has a large eccentricity of
0.89, and therefore the true anomaly changes dramatically near

Article number, page 12 of 21

its perihelion. Figure 11 shows the change in rh of Phaethon and
the aspect angle using the pole orientation (Table 1). During the
ten asteroidal days (≈ 1.5 day) near the perihelion, rh changes
by ∼ 10 % and aspect angle changes > 10◦. The environment
of Phaethon at its perihelion is a chaos of thermal inequilibria
under strong solar irradiation.

Although this weakens our assumption that the seasonal ef-
fect is negligible, such information can provide important hints
as to the probability of thermal fatigue and electrostatic dust loft-
ing. The chaotic inequilibria result in a large and sudden change
in temperature not only along the longitude but also along the
latitude due to the quick change in the aspect angle. As soon
as fracture happens and small particles are generated, they may
have reached an initial height or be lofted by the supercharging
eﬀect. In this work, initial velocity was set to zero with a small
initial height above AR (H = 1 cm) to show the validity of our
idea even when the initial condition is unfavorable. If the parti-
cles have a positive initial speed outwards, more particles could
have ejected. Moreover, there is a time-symmetry in the illumi-
nation condition on Phaethon along the latitude: The thermal (il-
lumination) history of the north during the perihelion passage is
nearly the time-reversal of that of the south because the aspect
angle is nearly 90◦. This may have implications on the latitu-
dinal particle size distribution on Phaethon, but investigation of
this matter is beyond the scope of this work.

4.4. Particle trajectory integration

One of the most important points to improve in this work is that
the large acceleration does not necessarily guarantee the escape
of particles. This problem is at least two-fold. First, the parti-
cle trajectory integration must be performed for varying height
of the particle, until at least the Hill radius (rH = 66 km; Jewitt
et al. 2019). Second, even though the particle can be ejected by
thermal radiation, it must have been generated (by, e.g., microm-
eteorite bombardment or thermal fatigue), and the initial condi-
tions must be known accurately. This second part is beyond the
scope of this work and has already been discussed in previous
sections to some extent, but we develop the ﬁrst point below.

We consider the particle trajectories in a frame in which the
observer orbits around the Sun with Phaethon, but does not ro-
tate around the asteroid. Thus, the particles are set to have an
initial speed of v0 = πD/Prot along the direction of the asteroid’s
rotation. Also, the centrifugal acceleration from the orbital mo-
tion and the gravitational acceleration of the Sun are balanced.
In the given reference frame, Coriolis force is negligible.

For the particles’ trajectories, the simplex integration scheme
(leapfrog kick-drift-kick) with a ﬁxed time interval of dt =
0.025 s is used. For selected test cases, longer time intervals
(e.g., 0.1 s) sometimes showed artifacts, but time intervals much
shorter than dt = 0.025 s (e.g., 0.001 s) did not change the re-
sult. In this preliminary work, Eqs. (13) and (15) are used for all
the cases. Nevertheless, it is meaningful to conduct the trajec-
tory integration, because the purpose of this preliminary study is

to reveal the possibility that small particles can escape from the
asteroid.

The initial positions of particles are selected by ±15◦ from
the morning and evening terminators at 5◦ intervals for ra = 1
and 2 µm (Fig. 12).

A particle is ﬂagged by three conditions:

(A) Escape from the gravity ﬁeld: The radial speed (cid:107)v · ˆr(cid:107) >

√

vesc(r) =

2GM/r.

(B) Landing on the surface: The particle height gets smaller than

0.1 cm.

(C) Oscillation over the surface: The particle starts to fall back

to the surface.

The condition (A) is applied when the particles are guaranteed to
escape from the gravitational ﬁeld of Phaethon. In the equation
of (A), M is the Phaethon’s mass and r is the asteroid-centric dis-
tance to the particle. vesc on the equator in our model simulation
is 2.5 m/s. There was no particle that once reached v· ˆr > vesc and
hit the ground in our test cases. This situation may happen due
to the solar radiation when the particle is ejected at high speed
towards the Sun. The condition (B) is applied when the particles
reach the asteroid surface. The condition (C) captures the artifact
caused by our assumptions that underestimate ather and aref as the
particle height increases. Hence, the particle may fail to further
accelerate outwards, even though it could have escaped from the
asteroid in reality. There are two ways to ﬂag (C). First, a par-
ticle’s height is divided by an arbitrary scale and if the quotient
(i.e., the integer part of H
scale ) is decreased during the trajectory
integration, it is ﬂagged (C). We set scale = 5 m. Another case

ity should be visible very quickly (< 1 day) after the particles
start to be generated.

The fact that most particles could not escape in Fig. 12a
implies the importance of thermal radiation: If it were not for
ather, particles could not escape easily. For example, let us take
a closer look at trajectories of olivine particles in Fig. 12a.
Many olivine particles could not escape from Phaethon. Among
them, the olivine particles initially at longitude of 75◦ (15◦ be-
fore the morning terminator) could nevertheless escape and were
ﬂagged as A. What mechanism removed them from the AR?
These particles have marginally positive net acceleration, atotal · ˆr
(ather + aref > agrav − acen in Fig. 5). Therefore, due to ather, it is
possible for these particles to achieve nonzero outward speeds
while rotating above the AR before sunrise. When the Sun rises
and a(cid:12) comes into play, the particles gain high speed along the
anti-solar direction within a few minutes. Then, as the footprints
of particles move towards midnight (longitude = 0 in Fig 5), the
contribution of ather increases again because of the higher tem-
perature (Fig 5). Meanwhile, vesc(r) decreases as 1/
r. Even-
tually, the particles are ﬂagged as (A) at x ∼ 320 m and 615 m
for ra = 1 and 2 µm, respectively. A similar explanation is ap-
plicable for magnetite in Fig. 12b. Magnetite particles in Fig.
12b are more strongly aﬀected by ather than olivine at a longi-
tude of < 90◦ (compare Fig. 5c and d), and hence escape from
Phaethon more easily than olivine. For all particles initially at
90◦ (cid:46) longitude (cid:46) 105◦, the net acceleration is always inwards
(toward the AR) in our Phaethon model (Fig. 5c and d), and
therefore they cannot escape and are always ﬂagged as (B).

√

If the thermal inertia Γ is updated as discussed in Sect. 4.2,
one would expect particles to become more likely to escape from
Phaethon if the initial position is near the terminator. The results
are shown in Fig. 13, and as expected, particles are more easily
ejected from the surface.

4.5. Phaethon’s diameter

It is important to mention that the diameter of Phaethon is not
constrained well among previous publications. In this work,
D = 5.1 km is adopted, because it is derived by the work that
determined the thermophysical parameters and spin vector in
Table 1 (Hanuš et al. 2016, 2018). A diﬀerent thermal mod-
eling study suggested D = 4.6+0.2
−0.3 km with geometric albedo
pV = 0.16 ± 0.02 and thermal inertia, Γ = 880+580
−330 tiu (Masiero
et al. 2019), whereas a radar study suggested D > 6 km (Taylor
et al. 2019).

Changes in diameter may aﬀect thermal inertia and/or geo-
metric albedo determination because the albedo is linked with
the diameter and the absolute magnitude, and thermal inertia is
a parameter used in TPM along with the albedo. It is beyond
the scope of this work to discuss the detailed eﬀects of the un-
certainties on these parameters. However, the change in the bulk
mass density ρM (Hanuš et al. 2018) does not aﬀect our results.
ρM is determined by Yarkovsky drift, that is, the change in the
semimajor axis of the asteroid. The Yarkovsky acceleration of
asteroid aY will be proportional to the reaction force from ther-
mal radiation from the asteroid, Ftr, divided by its mass, M. Be-
cause Ftr ∝ D2 and M ∝ ρM D3, the Yarkovsky acceleration
aY ∝ 1/ρM D. As aY is the observable, it remains constant, that
is, ρM D = const. The gravitational acceleration agrav ∝ ρM D (Eq.
18), and therefore it must remain constant even if D is updated,
because ρM is determined from the Yarkovsky drift. Hence, we
argue that the update in D will only lead to a minor correction

is when the particle’s longitude changes from lon ∈ [0◦, 180◦)
(morning) to lon ∈ [180◦, 360◦) (evening) or vice versa.

In Fig. 12, the trajectories of particles (ra = 1 and 2 µm) are
drawn until one of these three ﬂags is applied. The ﬂag is also
indicated at the initial position of each particle. If a particle was
initially near noon, the trajectory ﬁrst goes up (increased H) but
then down (decreased H) and repeats this oscillatory behavior
until it escapes or hits the ground. This is because of the under-
estimation of ather + aref, while a(cid:12) is estimated correctly. This is
why the initial positions were chosen only near the terminators
in Fig. 12. All the particles with the ﬂag (A) in Fig. 12 reach
this condition, i.e., escape, within 8 minutes and many reach this
condition within 5 minutes, except for olivine initially located at
a longitude of 75◦, which took 14 and 19 minutes to reach this
condition for ra = 1 and 2 µm, respectively.

Equation (12) gives a(cid:12) ∼ 60 mm/s2, which is ∼ 50agrav, for
ﬁducial particles with ra = 1 µm. Thus, ignoring any thermal ra-
diation and assuming atotal ≈ a(cid:12) for a ﬁrst-order approximation
(as in Jewitt et al. 2013), the particle reaches the Hill sphere ra-
dius (rH = 66 km; Jewitt et al. 2019) in 25 minutes or about one-
tenth of the rotational period of Phaethon. Only within about one
day will the particle reach the distance of 2.5 × 105 km, the dust
tail length of Phaethon (Jewitt et al. 2013). Therefore, the activ-

5. Conclusions and future work

In this work, the importance of thermal radiation from asteroidal
regolith surface acting on particles of radii of a few microns is
investigated for the ﬁrst time. Our results show that particles of
ra ∼ 1 µm are likely to have the largest outward net acceleration
on asteroids in the near-Sun environment (heliocentric distance
(cid:46) 0.8 au). The full range of “ejectable” particle size spans from
∼ 0.5 µm to (cid:46) 10 µm, although the exact range depends on the
physical properties of the parent asteroid and particle, as well as
initial conditions. This is consistent with observational studies
of Phaethon’s activity at its perihelion that suggested the ejected
particles have ra ∼ 1 µm.

However, this work should be taken with care because it
is agnostic to the mechanisms that generate the particles and
achieve the initial height above the regolith, similarly to other
works like studies of electrostatic dust levitation. Therefore, fu-
ture works may include investigations of those mechanisms, and
could also include the likelihood of the occurrence of thermal
fatigue as functions of heliocentric distance and location on the
asteroid and distributions of the generated particles in the size,
velocity, and asteroid-centric location domain. Other areas that
remain to be investigated are the eﬀects of simplifying assump-
tions used in thermal modeling. Most importantly, the problem
of underestimation of the thermal radiation for heights greater
than the isothermal length scale on the asteroid surface must be
solved.

Appendix A: Radiation pressure coefﬁcients

(Qpr(λ, ra))

As described in Sect. 2.3, the radiation pressure coeﬃcient,
Qpr(λ, ra), is calculated for two materials, olivine and magnetite.
The calculated Qpr values are shown as functions of wavelength
λ for selected particle radii in Fig. A.2 (olivine) and Fig. A.1
(magnetite).

The optical index is available at λ > 0.1 µm for magnetite
(Sect. 2.3) The derived Qpr from Mie theory is shown in Fig.
A.1.

For (low-Fe) olivine, two datasets of optical indices are
combined (Fabian et al. 2001; Sect. 2.3). The ﬁrst dataset is
composed of three indices as functions of wavelength λ =
2.0−4097 µm. The three indices are obtained from incident light
polarized parallel to each of the three diﬀerent crystalline axes
of olivine (orthorhombic). These are denoted E(cid:107)x, E(cid:107)y, or E(cid:107)z
following the notation in the original publication. The second
dataset is obtained based on a measurement for a randomly ori-
ented olivine sample in λ = 0.2−2.0 µm. After combining the
two datasets, the optical index is identical for λ < 2.0 µm, but
there are three separate cases for λ > 2.0 µm. These three diﬀer-
ent optical indices result in three separate Qpr curves in Fig. A.2
and ¯Qpr curves in Fig 2.

We further assumed Qpr = 1 for 0.1 µm ≤ λ ≤ 0.2 µm for
olivine to match the wavelength range with magnetite. For small
particles of ra (cid:28) 1 µm, the value of Qpr(λ ∈ [0.1, 0.2] µm, ra)
may be diﬀerent from unity (as in the ra = 0.1 µm curve in Fig.
A.2). However, this deviation is not critical because the contri-
bution of the radiation ﬂux at the short wavelengths to the to-
tal acceleration is small (for blackbody radiation of temperature
T (cid:46) T(cid:12)). Furthermore, as described in Sect. 2.4 and Fig. 2, the
resulting diﬀerence in ¯Qpr is negligible. Hence, ¯Qpr for E(cid:107)x, E(cid:107)y,
and E(cid:107)z are averaged to get olivine’s ¯Qpr value used throughout
this study.

Appendix B: Radiative accelerations derivations

In this section, we derive the equations we used in Sect. 2.4.

Appendix B.1: Auxiliary notations

The blackbody spectrum-averaged emissivity can be deﬁned as

¯(cid:15)(T, (cid:15)) ≡

(cid:82) ∞
0

(cid:82) ∞

(cid:15)(λ)Bλ(λ, T )dλ

Bλ(λ, T )dλ

.

(B.1)

We derived Eq. (10) using the Stefan–Boltzmann law,

(cid:90) ∞

0

Bλ(λ, T )dλ = σSBT 4

π

.

Next, the radiance (Planck function multiplied by the emissivity)
can be normalized by the total ﬂux:

bλ(λ, T, (cid:15)) ≡

(cid:15)(λ)Bλ(λ, T )dλ

(cid:15)(λ)Bλ(λ, T )dλ

(cid:82) ∞
0

.

(B.3)

Subsequently, substituting Eq. (B.1) and (B.2), we derive Eq. (9).
Similarly, Qpr can be averaged over the radiance, i.e.,

¯Qpr(ra, T, (cid:15)) ≡

(cid:82) ∞
0

Qpr(λ, ra)(cid:15)(λ)Bλ(λ, T )dλ
(cid:82) ∞
0

(cid:15)(λ)Bλ(λ, T )dλ

.

Article number, page 18 of 21

(B.4)

We then use Eq. (9) to derive Eq. (8). Using the above notations,
a simpliﬁed notation without integral is developed:
(cid:90) ∞

Qpr(λ, ra)(cid:15)(λ)Bλ(λ, T )dλ = σSBT 4

¯Qpr ¯(cid:15) .

(B.5)

π

0

This relation is used to derive Eq. (11).

Appendix B.2: Derivation of Eq. (11)
When an object with a geometric cross-sectional area of σ = πr2
a
is illuminated by a spectral irradiance of Jλ(λ), the magnitude of
the radiative force, i.e., the momentum ﬂux per time, is
(cid:107)F(cid:107) = 1
c

Jλ(λ)σQpr(λ, ra)dλ .

(B.6)

(cid:90) ∞

The magnitude of the radiative acceleration that the particle ex-
periences is a = (cid:107)F(cid:107)/m, where m = 4πρmr3
a/3 is the particle
mass. If the source is a blackbody with a solid angle of dΩ and
emissivity (cid:15), the irradiance Jλ = (cid:15)BλdΩ. Substituting m, Jλ, and
Eq. (B.5), a can be rewritten as
¯(cid:15) ¯Qpr(ra, T )
a = 3σSB
raρm
4c
which is Eq. (11).

Appendix B.3: Derivation of Eq. (13)

For the aref calculation, the irradiance must be integrated over
the surface elements within the ﬁeld of view. As we assume the
AR is a Lambertian scatterer, it leads to
rref(i) = AB
π

cos i ,

(B.8)

where rref = rref(λ, ˆΩi, ˆΩe(cid:48) ) is the bidirectional reﬂectance, and
AB is the Bond albedo of the Lambertian patch (for a deriva-
tion, see, e.g., Hapke 2012, Sect. 8.5.1). Therefore, the irradiance
from the inﬁnitesimal patch of solid angle dΩ is

dJλ,ref = Jλ,(cid:12)rrefdΩ = Jλ,(cid:12)ABµi

dΩ
π
where µi = max {cos i, 0}. By using µi, the reﬂected radiation is
“turned oﬀ” immediately after the sunset when calculated by a
code.

(B.9)

,

The Lambertian scattering leads to an azimuthal symmetry
of the scattered radiation from the local surface, so the acceler-
ation of the particle perpendicular to the z-axis will cancel out.
The acceleration along the z-axis from the inﬁnitesimal patch is
therefore (see Fig. 1)

(B.2)

daref = ABµi

dΩ
π

cos e(cid:48)(cid:48) × a(cid:12) .

(B.10)

The inﬁnitesimal annulus at angle e(cid:48)(cid:48) and width de(cid:48)(cid:48) has the solid
angle of dΩe(cid:48)(cid:48) = 2π sin e(cid:48)(cid:48)de(cid:48)(cid:48), and any patch within this annu-
lus will give an identical acceleration contribution to the particle
along the z-direction. Thus, the contribution of the annulus is ob-
tained by replacing dΩ with dΩe(cid:48)(cid:48) in Eq (B.10). The integration
of the annulus of radius from 0 to r0 is identical to the integra-
= tan−1(r0/H). If the height factor ˜H is
tion of e(cid:48)(cid:48) from 0 to e(cid:48)(cid:48)
deﬁned as Eq. (14),
(cid:90) e(cid:48)(cid:48)

Thus, after performing the integration, Eq. (13) is obtained.

Appendix B.4: Derivation of Eq. (15)

Similarly, the second criterion is reformulated using

For ather, similar to aref, the azimuthal symmetry is guaranteed.
Meanwhile, the acceleration (dather) due to the radiation originat-
ing from an inﬁnitesimal area on the AR with solid angle dΩe(cid:48)(cid:48)
is given by Eq. (B.7), with (cid:15) = ¯(cid:15)S , T = TS , and dΩ = dΩe(cid:48)(cid:48).
Then, multiplying cos e(cid:48)(cid:48) and integrating over dΩe(cid:48)(cid:48), in the same
way as done for aref, leads to Eq. (15).

Appendix C: Thermal fatigue reparameterization

Here, we derive the two criteria we used in Sect. 4.3.1. The two
criteria are from Ravaji et al. (2019), but we devise a more gen-
eral view using the (rh, Θ) coordinate by re-formulating them.

For the ﬁrst one, ∆ ˆTS > 100 K, we rewrite

∆ ˆTS =

∆ ˆTS
Teqm

× Teqm = cT × T1∆ˆuS (Θ)

(cid:19)−2

(cid:18) rh
1 au

≡ cT ∆ ˆT1 ,

for a dimensionless temperature used in TPM, u = T/Teqm (and
∆ˆuS = ∆ ˆTS /Teqm). The u proﬁle, and thus the ∆ˆuS , depend only
on the thermal parameter Θ (and the spin vector; see Sect. 2.2).
The term on the right-hand side, ∆ ˆT1 := T1∆u(Θ)( rh
1 au )−2, is the
∆TS when the asteroid is at rh but with cT = 1 (e.g., AB = 0
and ¯(cid:15)S = 1; see Eq. 4). All values other than cT are calculable
once the coordinate (rh, Θ) is given, and so it is mathematically
convenient to use

where ∆τ = Prot
nlon is the time bin and nlon is the number of lon-
gitude bin (nlon is ﬁxed in the TPM simulation). ∆u(Θ) on the
right-hand side is calculated numerically by taking the diﬀerence
of the consecutive u array elements in the code (u[1 :] − u[: −1]).
Therefore, ∆u(Θ)T1
is obtained for the coordinate grid
(rh, Θ). nlon
is a constant for the conducted TPM. The second
60
criterion is obtained by taking the maximum of the absolute val-
ues of the ∆u array in the code, and multiplying it by the con-
stants. Thus, it is more convenient to use

To generate the plot in Fig. 10, we set the grid of Θ on a log-
arithmic scale: Θ = 10x for 50 uniformly-spaced x ∈ [−2, +2].
The aspect angle is ﬁxed to 90◦. First the equatorial tempera-
ture proﬁle for these 50 models, u(Θ) = T/Teqm, are calculated
(see Sect. 2.2). Then the temperature is restored by multiply-
ing Teqm at each rh with cT = 1. The contours are calculated
∆ ˆTS and
for the re-formulated formulae, i.e., the contours are 1

For cT (cid:28) 1 (AB → 1), the ﬁrst condition pushes the region

thermal conduction (Γ → 0) and higher insolation (rh → 0).
Meanwhile, for a fast rotator (Prot → 0), the second criterion
requires a similar condition. This is also expected, because the
temperature proﬁle will be nearly constant at a given latitude for
such an asteroid, and the temperature change rate will be very
small unless it is close to the Sun and there is small thermal
conduction.

All the scripts, source codes and developed packages used to
generate datasets and plots in this work are available via the

olivine and magnetite, are available from the GitHub reposi-
