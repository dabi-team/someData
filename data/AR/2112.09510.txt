ABSTRACT
Using published work on the narrow-line region of Active Galactic Nuclei,
a comparison is carried out among the [O iii] λ4363˚A/λ5007˚A (ROIII) ratio
observed in quasars, Seyfert 2’s and the spatially resolved ENLR plasma. Us-
ing the weak [Ar iv] λ4711˚A/λ4740˚A doublet ratio observed by Koski (1978)
among Seyfert 2’s, we ﬁnd evidence of a Narrow-Line Region (NLR) populated
by low density emission clouds (∼< 104 cm−3). After considering calculations
of the [Ar iv] and [O iii] ratios that assume a powerlaw distribution of plasma
densities, no evidence of collisional deexcitation is found. The plasma tem-
perature that is inferred is 13 500 °K, which is problematic to reproduce with
standard photoionization calculations. The simplest interpretation for the
near coincidence of the ROIII ratios among the ENLR and Seyfert 2 measure-
ments (ROIII ≃ 0.017) is that the low density regime applies to both plasmas.

1. INTRODUCTION

The physics of the so-called narrow-line region of Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) has been amply studied (cf. Osterbrock 1978, and references therein).
AGN emission line spectra can be divided into two categories1: Type I when
the full width half-maximum (FWHM) of the permitted lines are signiﬁcantly
larger than the forbidden lines, and Type II where both the permitted and
forbidden lines have similar FWHM. The broad-line region (BLR) observed
in Type I objects originate from high density gas (> 108 cm−3) much closer to
the black-hole (BH) than the narrow-line region (hereafter NLR), the latter
being observed in both Type I and II objects. The AGN uniﬁed model sustains
that both types relate to the same phenomenon, with the diﬀerences being the
visibility of the central engine. It proposes that the BLR is hidden from direct
view in Type II due to an optically thick dusty torus-like gas structure sur-
rounding the central engine (black hole, accretion disk, and BLR) (Antonucci
1993). Whether the BLR is observed or not depends on the viewing angle of
the nucleus. Seyfert 2’s, QSO 2’s and Narrow Line Radio Galaxies (NLRG)
are classiﬁed as Type II while Seyfert 1’s, quasars, QSO 1’s and Broad-Line
Radio Galaxies (BLRG) are of Type I because their BLR is visible.

While it is customary for H ii regions to assume the low density regime
(hereafter LDR) when evaluating the plasma temperature using the [O iii]
λ4363˚A/λ5007˚A line ratio (hereafter labeled ROIII), this is inappropriate with
the NLR, at least in Type I objects. Osterbrock (1978) interpreted the relative
strength of the λ4363˚A line, which was measured to be higher in Seyfert 1’s and
BLRG than in Seyfert 2’s, as evidence of densities in the range 106 − 107 cm−3
within the NLR of Type I AGN. This interpretation was conﬁrmed by the
study of Baskin & Laor (2005, hereafter BL05) who compared the ROIII they
measured in 30 quasars. Their single-density calculations showed that the
broad range of observed ROIII ratios implies high plasma densities ranging
from possibly 105 up to 107 cm−3, providing convincing evidence of the im-
portant role of collisional deexcitation in Type I AGN where the temperature
cannot be directly inferred from the ROIII ratio. In the case of Type II ob-
jects (Seyfert 2’s and NLRG), the ROIII ratio is on average smaller (∼< 0.019)
although selection eﬀects may possibly bias such assessment. Prevailing NLR
photoionization models consider a distribution of clouds that extends over
a wide range of densities and ionization parameter values, whether the tar-
gets are Type I (Baldwin et al. 1995; Korista et al. 1997) or Type II objects
(Ferguson et al. 1997; Richardson et al. 2014). With respect to the spatially
resolved emission line component of AGN, the so-called extended NLR (here-
after ENLR), it consists of oﬀ-nuclear line emission from plasma at typically
LDR densities (e.g. Tadhunter et al. 1994; Bennert et al. 2006a,b) where the
ROIII ratio should provide a reliable temperature measurement.

The original element of the current work is the use of the weak [Ar iv]
λλ4711,40˚A doublet to evaluate to what extent the ROIII measurements of

our selected Seyfert 2 sample is aﬀected by collisional deexcitation. To cover
the multi-density case, we developed an algorithm, osald, to calculate den-
sity and temperature line ratio diagnostics appropriate to isothermal plasmas
in which the density follows a powerlaw distribution rather than taking on a
single value. This algorithm oﬀers the option of including a foreground dust
extinction component whose opacity, rather than being uniform, correlates
with the emission plasma density. Our main conclusion is that, at least for
the subset of Type II objects where the [Ar iv] doublet is observed, there is no
evidence of signiﬁcant collisional deexcitation. Hence in those cases the ROIII
ratio constitutes a direct temperature indicator. Oddly, LDR photoionization
calculations result in temperature discrepancies with the observations, un-
derscoring the so-called temperature problem (Storchi-Bergmann et al. 1996;
Bennert et al. 2006a; Villar-Mart´ın et al. 2008; Dors et al. 2015, 2020). In a
follow up Paper, we evaluate diﬀerent physical processes to address this issue.
Our reference sample is described in § 2 and a comparison with single-
component photoionization models is presented in § 3. A modiﬁed interpre-
tation of the NLR ROIII ratios observed near ≃ 0.017 in Type II and some
Type I AGN is proposed in § 4. These are subsequently compared with cal-
culations made with the algorithm osald (§ 5), which considers a powerlaw
density distribution.

2. REFERENCE DATA SET OF ROIII RATIOS IN AGN

In what follows, the term NLR will be used exclusively in reference to the
spatially unresolved nuclear component. For any line emission that originates
beyond the spatially unresolved central component2. of the active nucleus, it
will be referred as ENLR3 in all cases where the gas is deemed photoionized
by the AGN rather than by hot stars.

In order to evaluate the impact of collisional-deexcitation on the [O iii]
emission lines among Type I and II AGN, our data set consists primarily of the
quasar sample of BL05 (excluding upper limits data), to which we added the
four narrow-line Seyfert 1 studied by Rodr´ıguez-Ardila et al. (2000a, hereafter
RA00) which were originally observed by Rodr´ıguez-Ardila et al. (2000b).
To have access to measurements of the λλ4711,40˚A doublet, we relied on
the Seyfert 2 sample of Koski (1978, hereafter Kos78). Finally, to ensure
that our sample covers cases where the emission plasma is negligibly af-
fected by collisional deexcitation, we included diverse ENLR observations from
the literature. Fig. 1 describes the behaviour of the dereddened [O iii]/Hβ
(λ5007˚A/λ4861˚A) and ROIII (λ4363˚A/λ5007˚A) line ratios of our AGN sam-
ple.

2.1. Detailed description of the dereddened ROIII data set

The data set was extracted from the following sources:

2Where the densest plasma of the BLR and inner NLR is located
3When the line emission lies kiloparsecs or more away from the nucleus, some authors

(e.g., Tadhunter et al. 1988) prefer the term Extended Emission Line Region (EELR).

through ground-based observations by Kos78 (black hexagon) and HST-FOS obser-
vations analysed by Kr98 (black triangle), and C- ENLR measurements (all with
red ﬁlled symbols) consisting of 1) the average from BWS of two Seyfert 2’s and two
NLRGs (red dot), 2) the long-slit observations of the Seyfert 2 IC 5063 by Be06b
(pentagon), 3) the average of seven spatially resolved optical ﬁlaments from the

radiogalaxy Pks 2152−699 by Ta87 (large dot), and 5) the HST-FOS measurements
of two ENLR knots from NGC 1068 (red triangles).

A – NLR of Type I AGN

(a) Based on the prominent work of BL05, the sample consists of 30
Type I quasars with z < 0.5, mostly from the bright quasar sur-

vey of Boroson & Green (1992). Objects where only upper limits
of [O iii] λ4363˚A were reported have been excluded. The sample
is represented by bluish open squares in Fig. 1. The authors used
the [O iii] λ5007˚A proﬁle of each object as template for extracting
the NLR Hβ and [O iii] λ4363˚A line ﬂuxes. Since the latter line is
weak, its measurement required a proper subtraction of the under-
lying Fe ii emission multiplets. BL05 used the I Zw 1 Fe ii template
provided by T. Boroson (private communication) to subtract the
Fe ii multiplets. All the line ﬂuxes were corrected for dust redden-
ing and possible slit losses.

(b) The measurements of the four narrow-line Seyfert 1 nuclei (here-
after NLS1) from RA00 (yellowish open triangles) were annexed.
As detailed in their study, the authors used their own spectrum of
I Zw 1 to subtract the various Fe ii underlying features present in
their NLS1 spectra. They compared diﬀerent ways to extract the
Hβ NLR contribution, favoring in the end the procedure of ﬁtting
a narrow and broad gaussian component to the Hβ proﬁles. The
broad to narrow Hβ ﬂux ratios in these objects cover the range of
1.8 to 3.4.

(c) For comparison purposes, we included the measurements of two
well-studied Seyfert 1.5 galaxies (light-green open stars): NGC 5548
(Kraemer et al. 1998a) and NGC 72134 (Filippenko & Halpern 1984).

B – NLR of Type II AGN

(a) To characterize the behaviour of high excitation Type II objects,
we adopt the pioneering work on Seyfert 2’s by Koski (1978, here-
after Kos78), which provides the unique characteristic of reporting
reliable measurements of the weak [Ar iv] λλ4711,40˚A doublet ra-
tio, an essential density indicator for evaluating in § 4.2 and § 5.2
to what extent the observed ROIII is aﬀected by collisional de-
excitation. Table 1 lists the reddening corrected ratios of the high
excitation subset of their sample (i.e. with [O iii]/Hβ ≥ 10), which
consists of seven Seyfert 2’s. Two objects, Mrk 348 and 3C33, were
left out of Table 1 since their measurement of the [Ar iv] ratio unre-
alistically exceeded the low density limit value. They presumably
indicate emission from LDR plasma. The average ROIII ratio from
Table 1 is 0.0168 (i.e. 10−1.77 in Fig. 1), which is represented by a
large black disk whose radius of 0.088 dex corresponds to the ROIII
RMS dispersion. The average [O iii]/Hβ is 12.3 ± 1.1.

(b) As a complement to Type II objects, we averaged the measure-
ments of the four Seyfert 2’s IC 5063, NGC 7212, NGC 3281 and
NGC 1386 observed by Bennert et al. (2006b, hereafter Be06b).

4Initially associated to the LINER category, the presence of [Ne v] lines indicates a high

ionization plasma despite having [O iii]/Hβ < 1 due to collisional deexcitation.

It is represented by a small black circle corresponding to a mean
ROIII of 0.0188. Pseudo error bars represent the RMS dispersion
of 0.042 dex.

(c) The black diamond labelled a41 with ROIII = 0.0155 represents
the high ionization end of the sequence of reconstructed spectra of
Richardson et al. (2014, hereafter Ri14) which was extracted from
a sample of 379 AGN. These were identiﬁed by applying the Mean
Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA) tool to their
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sample of ∼ 104 emission line
galaxies in the redshift range 0.10 < z < 0.12 (see also Allen et al.
2013). They meticulously reviewed each spectrum to ensure that
no BLR component was present.

(d) Ground-based observations of the Seyfert 2 NGC 1068 nucleus by
Kos78 is represented by the black open octagon while the black
open triangle corresponds to the HST-FOS measurement of the
nucleus at a much higher spatial resolution of 0.3 ′′⌢
(archive data
Kraemer et al. 1998b, hereafter Kr98).

C – Spatially resolved ENLR emission

(a) The red ﬁlled dot stands for the average ratio from the ENLR of
four Type II AGN (two are Seyfert 2’s: ESO 362-G08 and MRK 573,
and two are NLRGs: Pks 0349−27 and Pks 0634−20) which were
studied by Storchi-Bergmann et al. (1996, hereafter SB96). The
mean ROIII ratio is 0.0169 ± 0.0029, which includes measurements
on both sides of the nucleus, except for ESO 362-G08 (Binette et al.
1996, hereafter BWS). Pseudo-error bars denote an RMS dispersion
of 0.07 dex.

(b) The Seyfert 2 IC 5063. The red pentagon represents the average
ratio ROIII = 0.0188 (with dispersion of 0.042 dex) from the ex-
tranuclear radial emission of the Seyfert 2 IC 5063 which Be06b
observed with a S/N > 3 from 8 ′′⌢

NW to 5 ′′⌢

SE.

(c) The Centaurus A (NGC 5128) ﬁlaments. The red square represents

the average ratio of seven optical ﬁlaments studied by Morganti et al.
(1991, hereafter Mo91) and situated along the radio jet at a mean
distance of 490 pc from the nucleus of the radio-galaxy Centaurus A
(mean ROIII = 0.0145 with a dispersion of 0.13 dex).

(d) Detached cloud emission aligned with radio-galaxy jets. The large
red dot represents the well studied 8 kpc distant cloud associated
to the nucleus of radiogalaxy Pks 2152−699 (Tadhunter et al. 1987,
hereafter Ta87).

(e) Two detached emission line ’knots’ of NGC 1068 labelled 1 and 2
(red triangles) which were studied by Kr98 using HST-FOS archive
data. The positions are oﬀ-centered from the nucleus by 0.2 ′′⌢
and
0.7 ′′⌢

3. PHOTOIONIZATION CALCULATIONS AT LDR DENSITIES

All our calculations will be presented in Fig. 3 in which the reference data
set is represented using the same symbols but colored in gray. For an isother-
mal plasma at a ﬁxed temperature, densities much above LDR would cause
an increase of the ROIII ratio, shifting its position to the right in Fig. 3 due
to collisional deexcitation. The segmented cyan arrow describes the increase
in ROIII expected from a 14 000 °K plasma slab whose density successively
takes on the values of 102 (LDR), 104.5, 105, 105.5, 106 and 106.5 cm−3. It
illustrates the density range implied by the BL05 and RA00 Type I AGN if
they shared the same temperature. For a 15 000 °K plasma, the critical densi-
ties5 for deexcitation of the [O iii] λ5007˚A and λ4363˚A lines are 7.8 × 105 and
2.9 × 107 cm−3, respectively, while for the[Ar iv] λ4711˚A and λ4740˚A lines
these are 1.7 × 104 and 1.5 × 105 cm−3. Let us compare the data with the
values predicted by photoionization calculations.

3.1. Above solar gas metallicities

The abundances we adopt correspond to 2.5 Z⊙, a value within the range
appropriate to galactic nuclei of spiral galaxies. For instance, the landmark
study by Dopita et al. (2014) of multiple H ii regions of the Seyfert 2 NGC 5427
favor abundances signiﬁcantly above solar. Using the Wide Field Spectro-
graph (WiFeS: Dopita et al. 2010), the authors could determine the ISM oxy-
gen radial abundances using 38 H ii regions spread between 2 and 13 kpc from
the nucleus. Using their inferred metallicities, they subsequently modelled
the line ratios of over 100 ‘composite’ ENLR-H ii region emission line spaxels
as well as the line ratios from the central NLR. Their highest oxygen abun-
dance reaches 3 Z⊙ (i.e. 12 + log(O/H = 9.16). Such a high value is shared
by other observational and theoretical studies that conﬁrm the high metallici-
ties of Seyfert nuclei (Storchi-Bergmann & Pastoriza 1990; Nagao et al. 2002;
Ballero et al. 2008). Our abundance set relative to H corresponds to
twice the solar values of Asplund et al. (2006) except for C/H and N/H,
which are set at four times the solar values owing to secondary enrichment,
resulting in a gas metallicity of Ztot = 2.47Z⊙ by mass. For the He/H abun-
dance ratio, we assume the solar value of 0.085.

3.2. Four alternative ionizing energy distributions

The four spectral energy distributions (hereafter SED) selected are shown
in Fig. 2. They are representative of published work concerning AGN pho-
toionization models and can be described as follows:

A the long dashed-line represents the SED used by Ferguson et al. (1997,
hereafter Fg97) in their calculations of Local Optimally emitting Cloud

5We deﬁne the critical density as the density where the line intensity, divided by both

the ion and the electron densities, reaches 50% of the low density limit value.

Fig. 2. The four SEDs described in § 3 and adopted in our LDR single-component
photoionization models of Fig. 3: 1) the SED assumed by Ri14 with Tcut = 105.62 °K
in their LOC model calculations (dot-dashed line), 2) a similar SED but with a higher
Tcut of 106.0 °K as explored by Fg97 (long dashed-line), 3) a powerlaw SED with
αF U V = −1.3 adopted by BWS (black continuous line), 4) the double bump thermal
SED proposed by La12 (thick gray line). Each SED is expressed in νFν units and
normalized to unity at 5 eV (2000˚A). In the X-rays, they all convert into a powerlaw
of index −1.0.

(LOC) models for the NLR. It is characterized by a thermal bump of
the form

Fν ∝ ναUV exp(−hν/kTcut)

with αUV = −0.3 and Tcut = 106.0 °K.

B the dot-dashed line represents the ’optimized SED’ used by Richardson et al.
(2014, hereafter Ri14) in their calculations of LOC models. It shares the
same index αUV as the Fg97 SED above but assumes a lower Tcut of
105.52 °K to describe the thermal bump. It is signiﬁcantly softer than
the Fg97 SED, yet due to collisional deexcitation being important in

NARROW-LINE REGION OF ACTIVE NUCLEI

LOC models, these qualitatively reproduces the ROIII and He ii/Hβ
(λ4686˚A/λ4861˚A) ratios of their reconstructed Seyfert 2 emission line
spectra.

C a powerlaw of index αF UV = −1.3 in the far-UV domain (continuous
black line) which was used by Binette et al. (1996, hereafter BWS) and
Binette et al. (1997) in their matter-bounded cloud calculations.

D the thick continuous gray line represents the sum of two distinct thermal
bumps as proposed by Lawrence (2012, hereafter La12) who postulated
that the accretions is entirely covered by intervening thick BLR clouds,
which would absorb Ly α as well as the softer ionizing radiation, thereby
accounting for the observed UV steepening short-ward of 1050˚A. The
author proposed that the absorbed EUV energy is reprocessed into emis-
sion at much shorter wavelengths, which generates the second peak near
40 eV.

Each SED converts in the X-rays into a powerlaw Fν ∝ ν−1 and results in

an αOX index6 of −1.35 except the BWS SED (αOX = −1.30).

3.3. Isochoric single-component photoionization calculations

Sequences of photoionization models are shown in Fig. 3 corresponding to
the four SEDs of Fig. 2. LDR was assumed as it is the appropriate density
regime for the ENLR plasma and for at least a signiﬁcant subset of the AGN
sample, as argued in § 4. They were calculated using the most recent 7 version
ig of the code mappings i (Binette et al. 2012) All models share the same
H = 100 cm−3 and each sequence includes up to six models8
density of no
along which the ionization parameter Uo increases in steps of 0.33 dex, from
0.01 (gray dot) up to 0.46. A ﬁlled square denotes the Uo = 0.1 model. All
calculations are ionization-bounded, dustfree and isochoric. The observational
data set represented in Fig. 3 uses only black or gray tones but with the same
symbol coding as in Fig. 1.

If we deﬁne the photoheating eﬃciency of each SED as the temperature of
the plasma averaged over the region occupied by the O+2 ion, we obtain for
the Uo = 0.1 model the following values of 11 300, 9700, 8400 and 8320 °K,
assuming the SED which we labelled BWS, Fg97, La12 and Ri14, respectively
(Fig. 3). The BWS SED possess the highest eﬃciency but is more speculative
as it excludes the possibility of thermal dump (or peak) in the far-UV. Such
a feature is to be expected if the continuum originates from an accretion disk,
which is widely accepted as being the primary mode of energy generation
in AGN. The double-peak reprocessed SED of La12 presents the advantage
of accounting for the ‘universal’ knee observed at 10 eV. The position of the

to increase the photoheating eﬃciency.

It is currently not possible to determine which abundances are the most

appropriate to the environment of active nuclei although it is generally ac-
cepted that metallicities above solar are most likely. If one assume the more
conservative metallicity of 1.5 Z⊙ of Fg97 and Ri14, a shift towards the right
takes place, as shown by the dotted line arrows in Fig. 3, assuming an ioniza-
tion parameter of Uo = 0.1.

What is the origin of the gap between the photoionization models and AGN
observations? The positions of models on the left of Fig. 3 correspond to LDR
conditions. It is a justiﬁed option for the ENLR, as argued in Appendix A.
As shown by BL05 as well as by the density sequence using the BWS SED
in Fig. 3 (gray dotted line), all models can be shifted towards higher ROIII
values by assuming plasma densities much above 104.3 cm−3. This is the main
reason why direct measurements of the density governing the [O iii] lines are
so important if we wish to determine the NLR temperature. Measurements
of the weak [Ar iv] doublet can give us access to this information as explored
below.

squares) with ROIII reaching ∼ 0.2 is the manifestation of collisional deexci-
tation from high density plasma. Their single-density photoionization calcu-
lations suggest densities of ≃ 106.5 cm−3. Interestingly, the four quasars on
the extreme left appear to clump at ROIII = 0.0195 with [O iii]/Hβ ≃ 10.5
in Fig. 3. At this position, single-density photoionization calculations from
BL05 suggest densities near 105.2 cm−3. If we consider an isothermal 14 000 °K
cyan arrow), the density we infer is very close to LDR, at
plasma (c.f.
103.3 cm−3. Our initial analysis of ROIII among Seyfert 2 galaxies indicated
that these show ROIII values similar to the leftmost quasars, which made us
question whether collisional deexcitation is related to their position in Fig 3.
Our analysis of the NLR data of Seyfert 2 galaxies, however, lead us to ques-
tion whether collisional deexcitation is related to the position of these quasars
on the left.
It is noteworthy that For instance, a similar position is occu-
pied by: 1) the sample of four Seyfert 2 nuclei of Be06b (dark-green dot), 2)
the reconstructed Seyfert 2 subset a41 from Ri14 (black diamond) which is
based on an ample sample of SDSS spectra, and 3) the seven high excitation
Seyfert 2’s of Kos78, as shown by the black disk, which represents the average
ROIII. We would argue that the accumulation of AGN on the left is most
likely representing a ﬂoor AGN temperature where collisional deexcitation is
not signiﬁcant. To support our hypothesis, we will make use in § 4.2 of the
density indicator provided by the λ4711˚A/λ4740˚A doublet ratios of Kos78.

4.1. Why do ENLR observations coincide with the leftmost NLR ROIII

observations?

Because ENLR emission operates in the low density regime (c.f. App. A),
they provide ideal measurements to compare Type II objects with. In Fig. 1,

a The line ratios from the 7 Seyfert 2’s were reddening corrected by Koski (1978) us-
ing the observed Balmer decrement. The measurement uncertainties were estimated

we added the following spatially resolved ENLR emission measurements: 1)
the Cen A ﬁlaments (red square, Mo91), 2) the average ENLR ratios of four
Type II AGN (red dot, BWS), 3) the radial ENLR emission from the Seyfert 2
IC 5063 (red pentagon: Be06b), and 4) the ionized cloud 8 kpc distant from
of Pks 2152-69 (large red dot, Tadhunter et al. 1987). All gather rather rel-
atively close to the leftmost Type I quasars (open squares) as well as to the
mean Seyfert 2 ratio of the Kos78 study (large black circle).
Interestingly,
the Seyfert 2 reconstructed subset a41 (black diamond) of Ri14 occupies a
similar position. The simplest interpretation would be that collisional deex-
citation is not signiﬁcant, not only within the spatially resolved ENLR but
among the leftmost objects as well, and that they all share a similar electronic
temperature.

4.2. Combination of the [Ar iv] and [O iii] diagnostics

To evaluate the NLR density, we will rely on the observations of Kos78
who measured the weak [Ar iv] λλ4711,40˚A doublet of his Seyfert 2 sample, an
unusual feature among AGN surveys. The observations were carried out with
the image-dissector-scanner mounted on the 3 m Shane telescope at the Lick
Observatory. The integration times were typically 32 min (A. T. Koski, PhD

NARROW-LINE REGION OF ACTIVE NUCLEI

13

thesis 1976). In Cols. (3–4) of Table 1, we present the reddening-corrected line
ratios of [O iii]/Hβ and ROIII.
In the context of high excitation planetary
nebulae. Kewley et al. (2019) pointed out that the [Ar iv] and [O iii] emission
regions signiﬁcantly overlap and that their respective ratios can be considered
representative of the high excitation plasma. A concern, however, is that the
weak He i λ4713˚A line lies very close to the [Ar iv] λ4711˚A line. Given the
much wider proﬁles of the NLR lines in comparison to planetary nebulae, both
lines will overlap. Hence the need to apply a deblending correction. The pro-
cedure we adopted for the single-density case is described in Appendix B.1.
It essentially makes use of the dereddened He i λ5876˚A line (Col. 6) to cal-
culate a reliable estimate of the contribution of the He i λ4713˚A line to the
blended9 [Ar iv]+ λ4711˚A+/λ4740˚A doublet ratio (Col. 5). The estimated frac-
tional contribution of the blended He i line to [Ar iv]+ is f HeI
blend (Col. 7), which
amounts to 5% on average. NGC 1068 stands out at a higher value of 10%.
For each object we iteratively determine which density nsng is implied by the
deblended [Ar iv] doublet ratio when it is calculated at the temperature T sng
OIII
which reproduces the ROIII ratio. The inferred density values, nsng, given in
Col. (8), all lie below 104 cm−3. As indicated by the cyan arrow in Fig 3, the
ROIII ratio is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by collisional deexcitation at densities
below 104 cm−3. Taken at face values, the densities of Table 1 indicate that
ROIII is a valid temperature indicator for the Seyfert 2’s of Kos78. The aver-
age temperature characterising the whole sample is 13 980 ± 1200 °K, which
lies signiﬁcantly above the predictions of the LDR photoionization models of
§ 3.3. Rather than assuming a single density, in § 5 we will consider the case
of a smoothly varying density distribution.

4.3. Density bias due to a limited spatial resolution

In Type I AGN, due to the favorable orientation of the observer with re-
spect to the ionizing cone (Antonucci 1993), the densest NLR components
are visible and possibly dominate the integrated line ﬂux, causing the ROIII
ratios to occupy values up to 0.2 due to collisional deexcitation, as proposed
by BL05.

In Type II AGN on the other hand, since the inner regions occupied by the
accretion disk and the BLR are not visible, important selection eﬀects take
place. The NLR is likely not fully observed due to obscuration associated to
the ionizing cone. Diﬀerences in spatial resolution as a result of the object
distance and the size of the spectrograph aperture inevitably aﬀect the sam-
pling of the NLR volume. The angular resolutions characterising our Seyfert 2
sample are the following. The reconstructed NLR spectrum of Ri14 was based
on SDSS observations of Seyfert 2’s of similar redshifts (0.10 – 0.12) with a
ﬁber aperture size of 3 ′′⌢
. This corresponds to a NLR sampling that extends
over 5.6 kpc diameter. The nearest AGN of the Kos78 sample is NGC 1068

9The sub-index + sign denotes a line that incorporates a blended component from a

at z = 0.0038, which is discussed in detail below. The other objects have
× 4 ′′⌢
redshifts in the range 0.0135 to 0.051 which, for an aperture of 2.7 ′′⌢
,
result in angular sizes in the range ≃ 1 to 4 kpc at the object distance. The
Be06b sample presents the highest spatial resolution since its four Seyfert 2’s
are of low redshift (0.003 – 0.027) and were observed with a seeing ∼< 1 ′′⌢
using
longslit spectroscopy mounted on the NTT and VLT telescopes of the Eu-
ropean Southern Observatory. The slit aperture was ≃ 1.1 ′′⌢
, which
translates into a NLR angular size of 50 to 600 pc. We might conjecture that
such superior spatial resolution is possibly related to the position of the Be06b
sample in Fig. 1, which is slightly more to the right than the Kos78 and Ri14
samples.

× 1 ′′⌢

Unlike the BL05 quasar sample where collisional deexcitation is the evi-
dent cause of the wide spread of ROIII values, the NLR of Seyfert 2’s appears
relatively unaﬀected by deexcitation, at least among ground-based observa-
tions. The much superior resolution from HST observations, however, reveal
the presence of much denser components within the inner nucleus. A case in
point are the HST-FOS observations of NGC 1068 (Kr98) with an angular res-
olution of 0.3 ′′⌢
(i.e. 25 pc). The nucleus (black open triangle), for instance,
shows an ROIII ratio higher by a factor two with respect to the ground-based
observation of Kos78 (black octagon). The image of the nucleus in [O iii] light
using the HST-FOC instrument shows a diﬀuse underlying emission compo-
nent that extends beyond 200 pc from the nucleus and which encompasses
a number of emission knots of sizes ∼> 10 pc. Two bright (EELR) emission
‘knots’, labelled 1 and 2 by Kr98 (red ﬁlled triangles) observed with the 0.3 ′′⌢
aperture show ROIII values that fall between those of Kos78 (octagon) and
of Kr98 with HST-FOS (open triangle). A red dotted line connects the four
measurements in Fig. 1. The two knots are situated at distances from the
nucleus of 0.2 and 0.7 ′′⌢

, respectively (i.e. at 16 and 57 pc).

5. MULTI-DENSITY TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY DIAGNOSTICS

We expanded the functionality of the ROIII temperature diagnostic by
combining the latter with the [Ar iv] density indicator, allowing us to evaluate
the impact of collisional deexcitation among the observed ROIII ratios. To this
eﬀect, we developed the algorithm osald (see App. C for further information),
which integrates the line emissivities from an isothermal plasma that extends
over a wide density range, up to a cut-oﬀ density, ncut. At a given temperature,
if ncut has a high value, the integrated ROIII ratio rises above the LDR value.
Since our diagnostics depends on measurements of the [Ar iv] doublet, we are
limited to the Kos78 sample of Table 1.

We have explored two options concerning the nature of the density cut-oﬀ:
1) that it simply consists of a sharp cut-oﬀ, or 2) corresponds to a gradual
cut-oﬀ due to a foreground dust extinction layer whose opacity correlates with
plasma density. The calculations assuming the ﬁrst option are summarised in
App. E and result in essentially the same temperatures as derived from the
single density case explored in § 4.2. We will now consider the second option

NARROW-LINE REGION OF ACTIVE NUCLEI

15

where we explore the possibility that the NLR emission becomes gradually
more absorbed towards the nucleus.

5.1. Components of the dust screen approach with osald

One particularity of our proposed approach is that it implies ﬁtting the
observed ROIII ratios presented in Table 2 rather than the dereddened ratios
of Table 1 and Fig. 1.

5.1.1. A density cut-oﬀ generated by a dust extinction gradient

The dust opacity is described by an exponential function of density n:
τV = τ o
V exp(n/nopa), where nopa is the e-folding density that deﬁnes the
gradual increase of the foreground V-band dust opacity towards the inner nu-
cleus. This deﬁnition does not require us to distinguish between the Galactic
extinction from that from the NLR dust screen (τ o
V includes both). Our inter-
est in exploring an ascending extinction towards the denser NLR component
is motivated by the accumulating evidence of the importance of the orienta-
tion of the NLR (and not just of the BLR) with respect to the observer, as
reviewed in App. D, and which is presumably the result of a cone-like opacity
distribution.

5.1.2. Extinction curve and line transfer algorithm

The line transfer algorithm implemented in osald fully takes into account
the eﬀect of multiple scattering across the foreground dust layers. Its charac-
teristics are described in App. C of Binette et al. (1993). As for the adopted
extinction curve, we adopt the one inferred by Martin & Rouleau (1991) in
their study of the Orion nebula, which diﬀers from the standard ISM curve in
that grains of size smaller than 0.05 µm are absent, resulting in a ﬂatter curve
with less extinction in the UV (Baldwin et al. 1991; Magris C. et al. 1993). It
is qualitatively in line with the evidence presented by Maiolino et al. (2001a,b)
that small grains are depleted in the dusty medium which is responsible for
the absorption of the X-rays and the reddening of the BLR lines. The V-band
dust opacity τ o
V is determined by ﬁtting the integrated Balmer decrement,
assuming recombination Case B at temperature TOIII. The values of TOIII,
blend are set by iteratively ﬁtting ROIII and the deblended [Ar iv]
nopa and f HeI
λ4711˚A/λ4740˚A ratio.

5.1.3. Transposition to a simpliﬁed spherical geometry

The algorithm consists in integrating the line emission measures10 of an
isothermal multi-density plasma (MDP) of temperature Te. The calculations
can be transposed to the idealized geometry of a spherical (or conical) distri-
bution of ionization bounded clouds whose densities n decrease as r−2. The

16

weight attributed to each plasma density component is set proportional to the
covering solid angle11 Ω(n) subtended by the plasma shell of density n. In the
case of photoionization models, such a distribution would result in a constant
ionization parameter Uo and the integrated columns NXk of each ion k of any
cloud would be to a ﬁrst order constant. For the sake of simplicity, to describe
Ω(n) we adopt the powerlaw (n/nlow)ǫ, which extends from nlow = 100 up
to 108 cm−3. If we transpose this to a spherical geometry where both Uo and
Ω are constant (i.e. ǫ = 0), the area covered by ionization-bounded emis-
sion clouds would increase as r2, thereby compensating the dilution of the
ionizing ﬂux and the density fall out (both ∝ r−2). In this case, the weight
attributed by osald to each shell is the same, otherwise when ǫ 6= 0 the
weight is simply proportional to Ω(n). MDP calculations are not a substitute
to photoionization calculations. They are only intended as diagnostics that
could constrain some of the many free parameters that characterize multidi-
mensional NLR models, including those which might consider a non-uniform
dust distribution.

5.1.4. Selection of the distribution index ǫ

To guide us in the selection of ǫ, we followed the work of Be06b who
determined that, for a spectral slit radially positioned along the emission line
cone, the surface brightness of the spatially resolved ENLR is seen decreasing
radially along the slit as rδ (with δ < 0), where r is the projected nuclear
distance on the sky. From their [O iii] λ5007˚A and Hα line observations of
Seyfert 2’s, Be06b derived average index values of δ[OIII] = −2.24 ± 0.2 and
δHα = −2.16 ± 0.2, respectively. Let us assume that such gradient extends
inward, i.e. inside the unresolved NLR. For our assumed spherical geometry
where the Hα luminosity across concentric circular apertures behave as r−2ǫ
(see § C.2), ǫ is given by −(1 + δ)/2. Hence we adopt ǫ ≈ +0.6 in order that a
long slit projected onto our spherical geometry could reproduce the observed
δ[OIII] value of Be06b. Out of curiosity, we have explored other positive values
and found that changes in ǫ were not critical and did not aﬀect our conclusions.

5.1.5. Importance of deblending the [Ar iv]+ λ4711˚A+ lines

As emphasized by Kewley et al. (2019), care must be taken when interpret-
ing the [Ar iv] doublet since the weak nearby He i λ4713˚A line is nearly super-
posed to the [Ar iv] λ4711˚A line, hence the need to apply a proper deblending
correction to the measured [Ar iv] ratios. The procedure adopted is described
in App. B.1. Because of the relative weakness of the He i λ4713˚A line, there
is no direct evidence of its presence in AGN spectra given its closeness to the
[Ar iv] λ4711˚A line. To deblend the ﬂux contribution from the He i λ4713˚A
line, we ﬁrst evaluate its expected ﬂux using the strong He i λ5876˚A line and

11Ω(n) = A(n)/4πr2 where A is the area of a shell of density n exposed to the ionizing
source at a distance r. For deﬁniteness we set the electron density equal to that of H,
n = ne = nH .

then subtract it from the [Ar iv] λ4711˚A line. Since we are dealing with He re-
combinations lines, the dependence of the He i ratio on temperature or density
is relatively minor. Hence obtaining a reliable estimate of the He i fractional
blend, to the observed [Ar iv] proﬁle is straightforward. The
contribution, f HeI
procedure is described in Appendices B.1 and C.4.

Another potential blending consists of the ﬁrst two lines of the [Ne iv]
quadruplet which comprise the lines λ4714.36, λ4715.80, λ4724.15 and λ4726.62˚A
(Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. 2015). For convenience, we will refer to them as consist-
ing of two doublets centered at λλ4715˚A and λλ4725˚A, respectively. Up to
densities of ∼ 106 cm−3, the unblended λλ4725˚A doublet is calculated to be
on average 35% brighter than the λλ4715˚A doublet. In those cases where the
λλ4725˚A doublet is detected, we can reliably determine the blended λλ4715˚A
doublet ﬂux and then subtract it from the blended [Ar iv]+ λ4711˚A+ lines.
Further information about the deblending procedure is given in App. B.2. No
detection of the [Ne iv] λλ4725˚A line was reported by Kos78.

5.2. Results from the multi-density plasma models

resents the estimated blending contribution from He i λ4713˚A to the [Ar iv]+

ﬁts. The e-folding dust screen densities, nopa, derived by OSALD lie in the
range 1500 to 16 000 cm−3. The average hTOIIIi for the seven Seyfert 2’s is

NARROW-LINE REGION OF ACTIVE NUCLEI

19

13 480 ± 1180 °K, being lower by only 500 °K with respect to the single density
case.

Having considered an explicit density distribution, with either dust obscu-
ration (Col. 10) or without (see Table B1 in App. E), we derive temperature
values that do not diﬀer much from the single density case of Table 1. This
supports our contention that collisional deexcitation is not aﬀecting signiﬁ-
cantly the ROIII ratios observed by Kos78. Given the relative proximity in
Fig. 3 of the Ri14 subset a41 (black diamond) to the Kos78 sample (black
disk), we might conjecture that LDR possibly applies to the a41 sample as
well since, at a redshift of z = 0.11, the large projected scale of the 3 ′′⌢
SDSS
aperture ensures signiﬁcantly more dilution of the inner dense NLR compo-
nent in comparison to the Be06b and Kos78 samples. We would need a larger
sample of [Ar iv] doublet measurements to conﬁrm that ROIII translates into
a reliable determination of the plasma temperature in Type II AGN.

5.2.2. Probing the possible blending of [Ar iv] by [Ne iv]

We present complementary calculations in Table 3 where we have assumed
the hypothetical case of the λλ4725˚A doublet reaching 30% of the observed
[Ar iv] λ4740˚A line intensity. The blending contribution from the He i and
[Ne iv] λλ4715˚A lines, that is f HeI
blend and f N eIV
blend , are presented in Cols. (7) and
(9), respectively, and the resulting deblended [Ar iv] doublet ratios are listed in
Col. (10). The opacities τ o
V (Col. 11) inferred remain about the same, but the
e-folding densities nopa (Col. 12) are typically larger by a factor with respect
to Table 2. The average sample temperature hTOIIIi is lower by only 125 °K.
At least for the Kos78 sample at hand, not including the λλ4725˚A doublet
should not aﬀect our conclusions concerning the Seyfert 2 NLR temperatures.

5.2.3. Detection of [Ne iv] in nearby Seyfert 1 NGC 4151

The critical densities of the [Ne iv] quadruplet lines all lie above 106 cm−3.
Because the [Ar iv] doublet emissivities at such densities are signiﬁcantly
reduced due to collisional deexcitation, a positive detection of the [Ne iv]
λλ4725˚A doublet might relate with having plasma densities much above those
deduced from the Kos78 sample. This might be the case in Type I AGN. In-
terestingly, the detection of the [Ne iv] λλ4725˚A doublet was reported early
on in the Seyfert 1 NGC 4151 by (Boksenberg et al. 1975). The line ratios of
interest for this object are shown in Table 3. A labeled star depicts its position
in Fig. 3. Eye estimates of the [Ne iv] λλ4725˚A doublet (from the published
ﬁgure) suggest a value of ∼ 0.3 with respect to the [Ar iv] λ4740˚A line while
the measurements reported in their Table I would imply a higher value of
0.62. In Table 3, we present three osald ﬁts in which the [Ne iv]/[Ar iv] ratio
(Col. 8) successively takes on the values of 0, 0.3 and 0.62. The two [Ne iv]
deblending corrections result in nopa values higher by factors of 2.2 and 7.5
for models 8B and 8C, respectively, with the deblended [Ar iv] doublet ratios

20

dropping to 0.496 and 0.294 (Col. 10). The impact on the inferred tempera-
ture is signiﬁcant, with TOIII from model 8C being 1870 °K lower, at 16 180 °K,
showing minimal evidence of collisional deexcitation being present. It would
be interesting to repeat this exercise if we could obtain higher S/N spectra.

5.2.4. The particular case of QSO 2’s

Through our literature search of Type II AGN measurements of the λλ4725˚A
[Ne iv] doublet, we came across three objects classiﬁed as QSO 2’s, that is,
Type II quasars corresponding to the high luminosity counterpart of Seyfert 2’s.
They are Mrk 477 (Villar Mart´ın et al. 2015), SDSS J1300+54 and SDSS
J1653+23 (Villar-Mart´ın et al. 2017) at redshifts z of 0.037, 0.088 and 0.103,
respectively. Their spectra were extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
data (SDSS; York et al. 2000) and the line ratios relevant to our analysis are
given in Table 3.

What stands out from these objects is their larger ROIII ratios. The
deblended [Ar iv] doublet ratios (Col. 8) do not imply signiﬁcant collisional
deexcitation, except at a reduced level in Mrk 477 where nopa reaches ≃
22 200 cm−3. Yet the TOIII values inferred (Col. 13) for the three QSO 2’s
are much higher than in Seyfert 2’s, which questions the plausibility of LDR
conditions. It is possible that AGN where the [Ne iv] λλ4725˚A can be detected
might indicate the presence of a double-bump in their density distribution.
We tentatively explored the addition of an additional denser plasma compo-
nent (∼> 106 cm−3) to our powerlaw. Our ﬁt to the [Ar iv] doublet was not very
sensitive to this component since both λλ4711,40˚A lines are aﬀected by colli-
sional deexcitation at the high density end. Even though the temperatures we
inferred came out at values lower than in Col. (13), the exercise was not con-
vincing as the number of free parameters exceeded the number of variables. A
possible interpretation is that the super-luminous QSO 2’s scale up in size to
the extent that their inner NLR become partly visible as is the case with the
high spatial resolution HST measurement of the nearby Seyfert 2 NGC 1068
(c.f. red triangles in Fig. 1).

6. TEMPERATURE PROBLEM WITH PHOTOIONIZATION

In conclusion, after integrating the emissivities of the [O iii] and [Ar iv]
lines over a continuous distribution of densities, we ﬁnd that the impact of
collisional deexcitation on the λ4363˚A/λ5007˚A (ROIII) ratio is not signiﬁcant
among ground-based observations of the seven Seyfert 2 sample of Kos78 who
provided measurements of the [Ar iv] density indicator, and therefore, their
ROIII ratio provides us with a reliable measurement of the NLR temperature.
A comparison of the values of ROIII observed among quasars, Seyfert 2’s and
spatially extended ENLR plasma, as displayed in Fig. 1, argues in favor of a
ﬂoor temperature for the NLR, which we situate at ∼> 13 500 °K. Our pho-
toionization models using mappings ig and assuming standard SEDs and low

NARROW-LINE REGION OF ACTIVE NUCLEI

21

densities predict ROIII values signiﬁcantly below those observed in Seyfert 2’s.
This discrepancy deﬁnes what we would label the ROIII-temperature problem.
In the current work, we found complementary evidence that the orientation
of the emission line cone with respect to the observer’s line-of-sight aﬀects
our characterisation of the NLR, whether in Seyfert 2’s (Kos78 sample) or in
quasars (BL05 and RA00 samples). We do not exclude the existence of a much
denser NLR component being present in ground-based observations, but we
would propose that, at least among Seyfert 2’s with z ∼> 0.02, the latter would
be strongly diluted by the much brighter low density NLR component, which
we evaluate has a density ∼< 104.3 cm−3. In quasars, where a larger fraction of
this dense and luminous component becomes visible, the resulting ROIII ratio
progressively increases up to values of ∼ 0.2 due to collisional deexcitation,
as proposed by BL05 using dual-density photoionization models.
It would
be interesting to investigate whether the [Ne iv] λ4725˚A doublet becomes
intrinsically stronger in Type I objects. A few luminous AGN in which we
reported the detection of the [Ne iv] doublet in § 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 appear to
favor a density distribution akin to a double-bump, such as the dual-density
approach of BL05, rather than the single powerlaw we have assumed.

APPENDICES

A. THE VALIDITY OF LOW DENSITY REGIME FOR THE ENLR

Among the Seyfert galaxies studied (e.g. Bennert et al. 2006a,b), the ENLR
densities inferred from the red [S ii] λλ6716,31˚A doublet are typically < 103 cm−3.
Along the long-slit measurements, in most cases both the electron density and
the ionisation parameter appear to be decreasing with radius. The authors
proposed that deviations from this general behaviour (such as a secondary

22

BINETTE, VILLAR-MART´ıN, MAGRIS ET AL.

peak), when seen in both the ionisation parameter and electron density space,
can be interpreted as signs of shocks due to the interaction with a radio jet.
In what follows, we will consider those cases where the excitation mechanism
is photoionization by the accretion disk. The red dot in Fig. 1 represents the
average ROIII of the ENLR of four12 Seyfert 2’s observed by SB96. If we as-
sume a temperature of 9 000 °K for the [S ii] plasma, the densities inferred by
BWS from the λ6716˚A/λ6731˚A ratios from each ENLR are ≤ 250 cm−2. Two
other examples shown in Fig 1 are: a) the yellow ﬁlled dot, which corresponds
to a deep spectrum of a 8 kpc distant cloud from the nucleus of radio-galaxy
Pks 2152-699 (Ta87), and b) the magenta dot which represents the average
ROIII of seven optical ﬁlaments situated at ∼ 490 pc from the nucleus of the
radio-galaxy Centaurus A (Mo91). In both cases, the red [S ii] doublet mea-
surements indicate low electronic densities, with ne ≤ 250 cm−3.

High excitation ENLR lines such as [O iii] should similarly operate under
LDR conditions for the following reasons. First, the geometrical dilution
factor of the ionizing ﬂux across the typical detector aperture does not vary
signiﬁcantly. For instance, if we deﬁne rin as the radial distance separating
the UV source from the inner boundary of the observed ENLR, and ∆r the
radial thickness corresponding to the detector aperture projected on the sky,
then the ratio (∆r/rin)2 represents the fractional change of the UV dilution
factor across the observed ENLR. This factor is typically ∼< 1.5, indicating
that the observed plasma is exposed essentially to the same ionizing ﬂux.
Line ratio variations across ∆r must be due to either variations in plasma
density or to a progressive absorption of the ionizing radiation, but not to
changes in the dilution factor. Second, if the [O iii] and [S ii] lines originates
from unrelated gas components, the densities of the low [S ii] emission plasma
must be order of magnitudes higher than the [O iii] emission plasma in order to
suﬃciently reduce the ionization parameter to the point that the low ionization
species dominate the spectrum. Third, if the [S ii] emission corresponds to the
partially ionized layer at the back of a photoionized (ionization-bounded) slab,
the electronic density of the region that emits the [O iii] lines is denser by a
factor of 2.5 to 4. The reason is that the [S ii] emission comes from plasma that
is partially ionized with an electronic density ne much lower than the local gas
density nH . This factor is suﬃciently small that for the typical [S ii] densities
of ne ≃ 250 cm−3 as found in the ENLR, the density associated to the [O iii]
lines would still be ≪ 104 cm−3 and LDR conditions should therefore apply.

B. CORRECTING THE [Ar iv] DOUBLET FROM LINE BLENDING

B.1. Correcting the [Ar iv]+ ratio from He i λ4713˚A blending

One characteristic of ratios involving recombination lines of the same ion
is their limited sensitivity to either temperature or density. A satisfactory

prediction of the He i λ4713˚A line intensity can be derived from the measure-
ment of the He i λ5876˚A line. First, we derive the Case B He i λ4713˚A/λ5876˚A
ratio, which we label RHe, via interpolation of the emissivities from the sup-
plemental Table of Porter et al. (2013). For a 104 cm−3 plasma at a temper-
ature of 12 000 K, RHe turns out to be only 4.78% of He i 5876˚A. Temper-
ature variations of ±2000 °K would cause a change in this ratio of +7.95
−11.5%,
respectively, while adopting density values of 100 and 105 cm−3 would re-
sult in RHe ratios of 0.0429 and 0.0489, respectively. Second, by deﬁn-
ing RHe/Ar as the observed He i/[Ar iv] λ5876˚A/λ4740˚A ratio, the product
(RHe/Ar × RHe) deﬁnes our estimate of the blending contribution from He i
λ4713˚A to the measured (blended) [Ar iv]+ doublet ratio. The relevant infor-
mation is provided by the fractional contribution of the blended line, which
blend = (RHe/Ar × RHe)/[Ar iv]+. The blended-corrected [Ar iv]

used to explore the single density case discussed in § 4.2 (see Col. (7) of Ta-
ble 1). For the powerlaw density distribution case, the procedure is described
in § C.4.

B.2. Correcting the [Ar iv]+ ratio from [Ne iv] λλ4715˚A blending

The [Ne iv] optical lines consist of a quadruplet at λ4714.36, λ4715.80,
λ4724.15 and λ4726.62˚A, respectively (Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. 2015). To simplify
the notation, we will refer to the quadruplet as consisting of two doublets: the
observed [Ne iv] λλ4725˚A lines and the potentially blended [Ne iv] λλ4715˚A
lines. At typical NLR densities, the potentially observed [Ne iv] λλ4725˚A
doublet is calculated to be ≈ 35% brighter than the [Ne iv] λλ4715˚A doublet
(blended with [Ar iv] λ4711˚A). To our knowledge the [Ne iv] λλ4725˚A doublet
has only been reported in a few AGN. However, it is frequently observed in
planetary nebulae (PN). For instance, in NGC 6302 where the stellar temper-
ature is estimated to be in the range 224 000 to 450 000 °K (Feibelman 2001),
the observed [Ne iv]/[Ar iv] λλ4725˚A/λ4740˚A ratio reported by Aller et al.
(1981) is 0.175. Since the emission lines of PN are narrow, the above men-
tioned lines can be resolved without any need of deblending provided high
resolution spectroscopy has been carried out. For instance, the observations of
the PN NGC 3918 by Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. (2015) using the Ultraviolet-Visual
Echelle Spectrograph (UVES, D’Odorico et al. (2000)) with an 1 ′′⌢
slit re-
sulted in a spectral resolution of 6.5 km s−1. The observed emission proﬁles
of each [Ne iv] quadruplet line were well resolved, showing a FWHM of ≃
20 km s−1. Interestingly, the [Ne iv]/[Ar iv] λλ4715˚A/λ4711˚A and He i/[Ar iv]
λ4713˚A/λ4711˚A ratios measured by Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. (2015) are 0.115 and
0.078, respectively. To correct the measured [Ar iv]+ (λ4711˚A+/λ4740˚A) ratio
from [Ne iv] blending, the density integration by osald of the two doublets
[Ne iv] λλ4724,26˚A and [Ne iv] λλ4714,16˚A proceeds as described in App. C.4
for the He i λ4713˚A and λ5876˚A lines.

C. THE OSALD ALGORITHM

Using emission line atomic physics, osald13 explores temperature and
density diagnostics in which an explicit distribution of the density is consid-
ered.

C.1. Line diagnostics with a powerlaw density distribution

Our goal is to explore which density distribution best reproduce a given
set of line ratios and to determine to what extent collisional deexcitation is
aﬀecting the observed ROIII λ4363˚A/λ5007˚A or RNII λ5755˚A/λ6583˚A line
ratios. For the high ionization species such as O+2, Ar+3 and Ne+3, the
temperature TOIII is set iteratively to the value which reproduces the target
ROIII ratio. Although not considered in the current Paper, other diagnos-
tics can be modeled such as the singly ionized oxygen [O ii] λ6726˚A/λ6729˚A
and [O ii] λ3727˚A/λ7325˚A line ratios at the temperature that would repro-
duce the temperature sensitive RNII target ratio, or the singly ionized sulphur
[S ii] λ6716˚A/λ6731˚A and [S ii] λλ4069,76˚A/λλ6716,31˚A line ratios at the
estimated temperature TSII ∼ 9000 °K.

C.2. Transposition of OSALD to a spherical geometry

The isothermal plasma considered by osald can be visualized as consist-
ing of concentric shells of plasma whose densities decrease radially as r−2.
These shells are given a weight which we associate to the covering solid angle
of a putative ionizing source at the center. This can be transposed to the
idealized case of photoionized shells that are ionization bounded and share
the same ionization parameter Uo. To the extent that the low density regime
applies, the line luminosities of each shell result equal if they share the same
covering solid angle Ω of the ionizing source. osald basically integrates the
line emission coeﬃcient times the shell covering solid angle: jk
ij (n, T ) Ω(n) ∆n,
where ij corresponds to the transition from level j to i evaluated at temper-
ature T and density n, which takes into account collisional deexcitation. The
integrated line ﬂux for line ij of ion k reduces to the summation in density
ij(T, nl) ∆nl, where nl is progressively increased in locked
space of
steps of size ∆nl/nl = 0.004 dex from no
H = 100 up to the cut-oﬀ density
ncut. When the ﬁt incorporates foreground dust extinction, ncut is ﬁxed at
108 cm−3 and the actual cut-oﬀ is set by the foreground dust extinction which
increases exponentially with density. The e-folding density for the opacity in
the V-band is deﬁned by the parameter nopa(see C.3). The weight of each
shell is given by its covering solid angle Ω, which follows a powerlaw of index
H)ǫ, where Ωo is an arbitrarily small constant
ǫ with density: Ω(n) = Ωo (n/no
that would ensure negligible shell shadowing. The density is postulated to de-
crease radially as n ∝ r−2. As a result, the shells’ luminosities behave as r−2ǫ
since positive values of ǫ imply a covering solid angle that increases towards

25

the ionizing source (along with the density n). A slit radially positioned along
the ionizing cone would result in an Hβ surface brightness that decreases as
rδ, with δ = −(2ǫ + 1).

C.3. Line transfer across the cone-like dust screen

In the context of Type II objects, we propose in § 5 that each emission line
is seen through a dust screen whose opacity increases exponentially towards
the inner denser regions. For each line ij, the opacity τij (n) is given by
τ o
V exp(n/nopa) A(λij )/AV , where τ o
V is the V-band dust opacity at the lowest
density no
H , nopa is the e-folding density of the exponential function, A(λij )
the selected extinction curve and AV the extinction value at 5 500˚A. When
integrating the emission measures, the dust transfer function Tr(τij (n)) is
applied to each emission coeﬃcient jk
ij (n, T ). The latter assumes a plane-
parallel geometry and takes into account both absorption and scattering due
to the dust grains, as described in App. C of Binette et al. (1993). In order to
constrain the parameter τ o
V , the set of line ratios that are selected to be ﬁtted
must include one or more Balmer line ratios from H.

C.4. Blending of the He i λ4713˚A and [Ar iv] λ4711˚A lines

To calculate the ﬂux of any He i line, the Case B recombination coeﬃcients
are taken from the work of Porter et al. (2013). They cover the temperature
range 5 000 ≤ Trec ≤ 25 000 °K and density range 102 ≤ ne ≤ 1014 cm−3.
By default the temperature assumed for He i in the current work is Trec =
12 000 °K while it is the variable TOIII for [Ar iv] and all the high ionization
ions.

In order to evaluate the blending of the weak He i λ4713˚A line with the
[Ar iv] λ4711˚A line, osald integrates the emission ﬂux of the following four
lines: He i λ4713˚A, He i λ5876˚A, [Ar iv] λ4711˚A and [Ar iv] λ4740˚A, taking
into account dust extinction at the corresponding densities. This procedure
properly takes into account how the emission coeﬃcient of each line is aﬀected
by density and collisional deexcitation as well as by dust extinction which may
increase along with density. After assuming an arbitrary abundance ratio of
the two ionic species He+ and Ar+3, the algorithm derives the integrated
He i/[Ar iv] ratio labelled R5876/4740 and rescale it to the observed value. The
R4713/4740 ratio represents a measure of the blending contribution from He i
and is derived from the ratio R4713/5876/R5876/4740. Deblending the [Ar iv]
R4711/4740 ratio is achieved by subtracting the R4713/4740 ratio from the ob-
served blended [Ar iv]+ ratio. The fraction of [Ar iv]+ due to He i blending is
labelled f HeI

blend in all our Tables.

C.5. Minimum χ2

where m is the number of line ratios simultaneously ﬁtted, wi the weight at-

corresponding line ratios derived from the integration of the line ﬂuxes. The
quantity xj represents the various parameters on which the line integration
depends on, that is, the temperature Tf it and density n as well as the parame-
ters describing the behaviour of the covering angle Ω(n), which are ǫ and ncut
as deﬁned in App. C.2. As detailed in § 5.2 and Table 2, we used the algorithm
to ﬁt the line ratios of the seven Type II NLR of Table 1. By trial and error
we settled for weights wi of 2.0 and 1.5 for the [Ar iv] λ4711˚A/λ4740˚A and
ROIII λ4363˚A/λ5007˚A ratios, respectively.

osald’s basic goal is to evaluate whether or not there is evidence of sig-
niﬁcant collisional deexcitation aﬀecting the ROIII ratio of any AGN whose
λ4711˚A/λ4740˚A ratio is successfully measured. Any ﬁt where χ2
rno exceeds
0.05 is deemed unsatisfactory and of no use. The ﬁts described in Tables 1–3
rno ∼ 5 × 10−7. For this reason, the line ratios derived
all present a negligible χ2
from the ﬁts are, for all practical purposes, equal to the target ratios.

D. NLR ORIENTATION AND THE OBSERVER’S PERSPECTIVE

The geometrical set up behind the uniﬁed model may apply not only to the
BLR but to parts of the NLR that are gradually obscured in Type II objects.
This would explain why the NLR line emission observed in the Seyfert 2’s cor-
respond to a much lower density plasma than observed in Type I’s. Examples
of studies conﬁrming the impact of the observer’s perspective on the NLR are:

a) Using a data set of 18 Seyfert 1 and 17 Seyfert 2 of similar redshift from
the literature, Murayama & Taniguchi (1998) showed the evidence of an
excess of Fe vii λ6086˚A emission in Type I AGN with respect to Type II.
The Fe vii/[O iii] (λ6087˚A/λ5007˚A) ratio in Type I AGN turns out to
be an order of magnitude larger than in Type II. They proposed that it
was linked to a region residing in the inner wall of a dusty torus, which
they labeled the high-ionization nuclear emission line region (HINER14).

b) Using a sample of 214 Seyferts, Nagao et al. (2001, hereafter NMT) con-
ﬁrmed that Type I Seyferts show a statistically higher ROIII than Type II
Seyferts. Using the work of De Robertis & Osterbrock (1984, 1986) who
measured the line widths of 24 Seyferts, MNT found that the FWHM
of [O iii] λ4363˚A in Type I spectra was larger than that of [O iii] λ5007˚A

14Terminology suggested by Murayama et al. (1998) to contrast those AGN from LINER.

NARROW-LINE REGION OF ACTIVE NUCLEI

27

while in Type II spectra the FWHM of both lines were statistically in-
distinguishable. Although with less statistical signiﬁcance, two more re-
sults were presented by NMT: 1) the FWHM of [O iii] λ4363˚A was larger
in Type I than in Type II spectra, and 2) the FWHM of [O iii] λ5007˚A
in Type I and Type II spectra were statistically indistinguishable. The
authors commented that these results would suggest that the strongly
[O iii] λ4363˚A emitting region is located in a deeper inner region as com-
pared to [O iii] λ5007˚A and that it is fully visible only in Type I AGN.
MNT inferred that the dependence of ROIII on AGN types can be at-
tributed to obscuration eﬀects.

c) Mel´endez et al. (2008) favor a similar interpretation with respect to the
mid-infrared coronal lines. They found that the mean [O iii] λ5007˚A line
luminosity is 1.4 dex smaller in Seyfert 2’s than in Seyfert 1’s while in the
case of the mean [O iv] λ25.89 µm line luminosity, the diﬀerence between
the two subgroups is only 0.2 dex. Their linear regression in the log plane
of each AGN subgroup reveals that the luminosity of [O iii] scaled almost
linearly as L0.9±0.1
in Seyfert 1’s, but much more steeply, as L1.8±0.5
[O IV ]
[O IV ]
in Seyfert 2’s. Both trends are consistent with strong dust absorption
of [O iii] while [O iv] is relatively little aﬀected by extinction. It con-
ﬁrms earlier reports of Jackson & Browne (1991); Cameron et al. (1993);
Mulchaey et al. (1994); Keel et al. (1994); Rhee & Larkin (2005); Netzer et al.
(2006) that a much higher dust extinction aﬀects the optical NLR of
Seyfert 2’s than of Seyfert 1.

d) Finally, the work of Rose et al. (2015b,a) of Coronal-Line Forest Active
Galactic Nuclei (CLiF AGN), which are characterized by a rich spec-
trum of optical forbidden high-ionization lines, suggests that the inner
obscuring torus wall is the most likely location of the coronal line region.

E. DUST-FREE OSALD CALCULATIONS

In § 4.2, we assumed a single plasma density to determine the plasma tem-
perature of the Kos78 Seyfert 2 sample. We present in Table B1 calculations
from osald where the density is represented by a powerlaw density distribu-
tion of index ǫ = +0.6 that extends from n = 100 cm−3 up to a sharp cut-oﬀ
density ncut. The blending corrected [Ar iv] λ4711˚A/λ4740˚A ratios are given
in Col. (4) where we followed the procedure described in Appendices B.1 and
C.4 to evaluate the He i λ4713˚A fractional contribution f HeI
blend to the blended
[Ar iv]+ line. The free parameters ncut and TOIII were iteratively varied until
they reproduced the dereddened ratios of both ROIII (Col. 4) and (blended)
[Ar iv]+ (Col. 5) from data Table 1. The inferred values for ncut and TOIII are
given in Cols. (5–6) of Table B1.

The plasma temperatures TOIII of Table B1 are essentially the same as
those of Col. (9) from Table 1 that were derived assuming a single density.
The main reason is that, insofar as the [O iii] lines are concerned, the line

aBased on the reddening corrected line ratios of Table 1. The ﬁts to both the ROIII
ratio and [Ar iv] doublet assume a density distribution that extends from 100 cm−3
up to the cut-oﬀ density ncut. The plasma covering factor follows a powerlaw func-
tion of density with index ǫ = +0.6.
b The target [Ar iv] λ4711˚A/λ4740˚A ratios after the He i deblending corrections
have been applied to the observed values given in Col. (5) of Table 1.
c The averaged temperature for the sample is hTOIIIi = 13 380 °K.

emissivities for the whole sample take place in the low density regime and,
as a result, the density averaged over the whole distribution, ¯n, turns out
to be very close to the single density value nsng from Table 1 (Col. 8). For
instance, for the object with the highest cut-oﬀ density of Col. (5), NGC 1068,
the ratio ROIII increases by only 3% across the range of densities covered by
the powerlaw distribution and the average density, ¯n, is 9425 cm−3, which
is close to the single density nsng value of 8770 cm−3. For the four objects
where ncut < 104 cm−3, the mean densities ¯n are proportionally closer to the
corresponding nsng values.

We conclude that for a covering angle Ω that increases monotonically with
density, there is no evidence of the ROIII ratio being aﬀected by collisional
deexcitation among the Seyfert 2 sample of Kos78. We cannot rule out the
existence of a double bump being present in the density distribution of some
AGN. The cause could be the existence of a high density component above
∼> 106 cm−3 since such component would not contribute to the [Ar iv] lines and,
therefore, our modelling would not be sensitive to it. There are indications
that such component might be present in QSO 2’s as proposed in § 5.2.4.
