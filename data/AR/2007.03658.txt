The prospects of extracting new physics signals in a coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
(CEνNS) process are limited by the precision with which the underlying nuclear structure physics,
embedded in the weak nuclear form factor, is known. We present microscopic nuclear structure
physics calculations of charge and weak nuclear form factors and CEνNS cross sections on 12C, 16O,
40Ar, 56Fe and 208Pb nuclei. We obtain the proton and neutron densities, and charge and weak form
factors by solving Hartree-Fock equations with a Skyrme (SkE2) nuclear potential. We validate our
approach by comparing 208Pb and 40Ar charge form factor predictions with elastic electron scattering
data. In view of the worldwide interest in liquid-argon based neutrino and dark matter experiments,
we pay special attention to the 40Ar nucleus and make predictions for the 40Ar weak form factor and
the CEνNS cross sections. Furthermore, we attempt to gauge the level of theoretical uncertainty
pertaining to the description of the 40Ar form factor and CEνNS cross sections by comparing relative
diﬀerences between recent microscopic nuclear theory and widely-used phenomenological form factor
predictions. Future precision measurements of CEνNS will potentially help in constraining these
nuclear structure details that will in turn improve prospects of extracting new physics.

INTRODUCTION

Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS),
where the only detectable reaction product is a low mo-
mentum recoiling nucleus, was suggested soon after the
experimental discovery of a weak neutral current in neu-
trino interactions [1]. Even though for neutrino energies
of some tens of MeV the CEνNS cross section is a few
orders of magnitude larger than competing inelastic pro-
cesses, the diﬃculty in detecting the
keV scale recoil of
a nucleus has hindered experimental detection of this pro-
cess for decades. In 2017, the COHERENT collaboration
detected the ﬁrst CEνNS signal using a stopped–pion
beam in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory with a CsI detectors [2, 3],
followed up by another recent measurement in a liquid
argon (LAr) detector [4, 5].

∼

The detection of CEνNS has opened up a slew of
opportunities in high-energy physics, astrophysics and
in nuclear physics,
inspiring new probes into beyond-
Standard-Model (BSM) physics and new experimental
methods. Several extensions of the SM that can be ex-
plored at low energy such as non–standard interactions
(NSI) [6–9], sterile neutrinos [10, 11], CP–violation [12],
as well as exploration of nuclear eﬀects, are being stud-

been or are being set up to detect CEνNS and BSM
signals in the near future using stopped–pion neutrino
sources in COHERENT at the SNS [2] and Coherent
CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) at Los Alamos National Lab-
oratory (LANL) [17], as well as reactor–produced neu-
trinos in CONNIE [18], MINER [19], νGEN [20], NU-
CLEUS [21], RICOCHET [22], and TEXONO [23].

The main source of uncertainty in the evaluation of
the CEνNS cross section is the accuracy with which the
underlying nuclear structure and nucleon dynamics that
determine the distributions of the nucleon density in the
nuclear ground state, embedded in the form factor, are
known in the target nucleus. The ground state pro-
ton (charge) density distributions are relatively well con-
strained through elastic electron scattering experiments
pioneered by Hofstadter and collaborators at the Stan-
ford Linear Accelerator [24], followed by other measure-
ments in the following decades [25–27]. CEνNS is how-
ever primarily sensitive to the neutron density distribu-
tions of the nucleus, which are only poorly constrained.
Hadronic probes have been used to extract neutron dis-
tributions, these measurements are however plagued by
ill-controlled model–dependent uncertainties associated
with the strong interaction [28]. More (experimentally)
challenging electroweak probes such as parity–violating
electron scattering (PVES) [28, 29] and CEνNS provide
relatively model-independent ways of determining neu-
tron distributions. In recent years, one such PVES ex-
periment, PREX at Jeﬀerson lab, has measured the weak
charge of 208Pb at a single value of momentum trans-
fer [30, 31], while a follow up PREX–II experiment is
ongoing to improve the precision of that measurement.
Another PVES experiment, CREX at Jeﬀerson lab, is
underway to measure the weak form factor of 48Ca [32].
Future ton and multi-ton CEνNS detectors will enable
more precise measurements and will potentially oﬀer a
powerful avenue to constrain neutron density distribu-
tions and weak form factors of nuclei at low momentum
transfers where the process remains coherent [13, 14, 33].

As long as no precision measurements of neutron den-
sity distributions of nuclei are available, the weak nu-
clear form factor has to be modeled in order to evaluate
the CEνNS cross section and event rates. The accuracy
of such an assumption is vital to the CEνNS program
since any experimentally measured deviation from the

expected CEνNS event rate can point to new physics or
to unconstrained nuclear physics. It is therefore crucial
to treat the underlying nuclear structure physics that is
embedded in nuclear form factors with utmost care. Phe-
nomenological approaches, such as the Klein–Nystrand
form factor [34] adapted by the COHERENT collabo-
ration, or the Helm form factor [35] where density dis-
tributions are represented by analytical expressions, are
widely used in the CEνNS community. Empirical val-
ues of the proton rms radius, measured in elastic elec-
tron scattering, are often used to evaluate the proton
form factor and often similar parameterizations are as-
sumed for the neutron form factor. Microscopic nuclear
physics approaches which describe a more accurate pic-
ture of the nuclear ground state and density distributions
such as density functional theory [33], coupled–cluster
theory from ﬁrst principles [36], relativistic mean–ﬁeld
model
[37], and Hartree–Fock plus Bardeen–Cooper–
Schrieﬀer model [38] have also been reported in recent
years.

In this work we will present a microscopic many–body
nuclear theory model where the nuclear ground state
is described in a Hartree–Fock (HF) approach with a
Skyrme (SkE2) nuclear potential. We calculate proton
and neutron density distributions, charge and weak form
factors, and CEνNS cross sections on 12C, 16O, 40Ar,
56Fe and 208Pb, and confront our predictions with the
available experimental data.
In view of the worldwide
interest in liquid–argon–based neutrino and dark mat-
ter experiments, we pay special attention to the 40Ar
nucleus. We attempt to gauge the level of theoretical un-
certainty pertaining to the description of the 40Ar form
factor and CEνNS cross section by comparing relative
diﬀerences between recent nuclear theory and widely–
used phenomenological form factor predictions.

tion III A, and compare our predictions with experimen-
tal data and other theoretical calculations. We present

II. FORMALISM

In this section, we lay out the general formalism of
calculating the (diﬀerential) cross section and form fac-
tor for coherent elastic neutrino scattering oﬀ a nucleus
governed by the weak neutral current where a single Z 0
boson is exchanged between the neutrino and the target
nucleus.

target nucleus.

A. CEνNS Cross Section

A neutrino with four momentum ki = (Ei, (cid:126)ki) scatters
oﬀ the nucleus, which is initially at rest in the lab frame
with pA = (MA,(cid:126)0), exchanging a Z 0 boson. The neutrino
scatters oﬀ carrying away four momentum kf = (Ef , (cid:126)kf )
while the nucleus remains in its ground state and receives
a small recoil energy T , so that p(cid:48)A = (MA + T, (cid:126)p(cid:48)A) with
A and T = q2/2MA. Here, MA

Under the assumption that the nuclei of interest are
spherically symmetric with J π = 0+ and taking the z–
axis to be along the direction of (cid:126)q, one only needs to take
into account the zero and third component of the nuclear
current’s vector part, which are furthermore connected
through conserved vector current (CVC):

qµ (cid:98)Jµ((cid:126)q) = 0.

In Eq. (9) and (10), we have expressed the CEνNS
kinematic distribution both in neutrino scattering angle,
θf , and in nuclear recoil energy, T. In most experiments
the only signal of a CEνNS event is a nuclear recoil en-
ergy deposition.
In principle, future experiments with
more advanced detector technologies may be able to de-
tect both nuclear recoil and angular distribution simul-
taneously. Such capabilities are already being explored
in some dark-matter experiments and will greatly en-
hance the physics capabilities of future CEνNS experi-
ments [40].

We employ a microscopic many–body nuclear theory

solve the HF equations to obtain single–nucleon wave
functions for the bound nucleons in the nuclear ground
state. We evaluate proton (ρp(r)) and neutron (ρn(r))
density distributions from those wave functions. The pro-
ton and neutron densities are utilized to calculate charge
(Fch(Q2)) and weak (FW (Q2)) nuclear form factors. This
approach involves realistic nuclear structure calculations

more reliable compared to the phenomenological ap-
proaches that rely on the approximation ρn(r)
ρp(r),
utilizing empirical values of ρp(r) extracted from electron
scattering experiments. Our approach has been devel-
oped and tested against several electron- and neutrino-
nucleus scattering scenarios [41–54]. The eﬀects of long-
range correlations included through a continuum Ran-
dom Phase Approximation (CRPA) approach, described
in aforementioned references, are found to be very small
in evaluating ground state densities of nuclei [55] and are
therefore not included in this work.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

clear weak charge is predominately carried by the neu-
trons. The weak form factor FW (Q2), and hence the
CEνNS cross section, are dominated by the distribution
of neutrons within the nucleus. As proton densities are
well constrained by experimental elastic electron scatter-
ing data [27] while little reliable neutron density data
is available, phenomenological approaches approximate
Fp(Q2), mak-
ρn(r)
ing the nuclear form factor more of a global factor [56].
Within the HF–SkE2 approach we treat proton and neu-
tron densities and their corresponding form factors sepa-
rately and do not have to rely on such assumptions. The
densities are deﬁned in terms of the radial single particle
wave functions as

ρp(r) and thus assume Fn(Q2)

with data for q (cid:46) 1.8 fm−

ison with the relativistic mean-ﬁeld (RMF) predictions of

both models up to q (cid:46) 1.8 fm−

single data point measured at a momentum transfer of
1 by the PREX collaboration [30, 31]. This

remains the only measurement of the weak form factor
obtained with an electroweak probe. The error bars on
the data point are too large to discriminate between the-
oretical predictions. The follow–up PREX–II measure-
ment at Jeﬀerson lab aims to reduce the error bars by at
least a factor of three.

Comparing the left and the right panels of Fig. 3 one
can see that although the charge and weak form factors
have a similar overall structure, the minima and max-
ima of both occur at diﬀerent values of the momentum
transfer. To further illustrate this, in Fig. 4, we show
the “weak-skin” form factor [28] of 208Pb, deﬁned as the
diﬀerence between the charge and weak form factors:

FW,skin(q) = Fch(q)

Fw(q),

(17)

which, near the origin, is proportional to the experimen-
tally observable weak skin [28]. The ﬁgure shows that

the diﬀerence between the charge and weak form factors
rises rapidly for q (cid:46) 0.5 fm−
1 and falls oﬀ after the ﬁrst
minimum.

The total CEνNS cross section as a function of neu-
trino energy for 12C, 16O, 40Ar, 56Fe and 208Pb is shown
in Fig. 5. All nuclei show similar a behavior: there is a
rapid rise of the cross section up to about
30 MeV,
then the steep increase slows down and ﬂattens out on
the log scale thereafter. The cross section increases with
the atomic number, with nearly two to three orders of
magnitude diﬀerence between 12C and 208Pb, reﬂecting
the

N 2 scaling behavior shown in Eq. 11.

eﬀects are vital to describe the quasielastic scattering
process where the nucleus can be excited to low-lying
collective nuclear states. For the energies relevant for
pion decay-at-rest neutrinos, E (cid:46) 52 MeV, the CEνNS
cross section is roughly two orders of magnitude larger
than inelastic cross sections.

A. Constraining 40Ar

In view of the worldwide interest in liquid argon (LAr)–
based detectors in neutrino and dark matter experiments,
in this section we will focus on 40Ar. In the COHERENT
collaboration’s expanding series of detectors at SNS, the
collaboration has recently presented new measurements
from a 24-kg, single–phase, LAr CENNS-10 detector [5]
while a ton-scale LAr experiment is underway. A 10
ton LAr scintillation detector, Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills
(CCM), was recently built at LANL to study CEνNS on
40Ar and to search for low–mass dark matter that co-
herently scatters oﬀ 40Ar nuclei [17]. Several other neu-
trino [57, 58] and dark matter experiments [59–62] em-
ploy LAr detectors, making it vital to study ground state
properties of the 40Ar nucleus.

In Fig. 7 we compare our argon charge form factor
(Fch(q)) predictions with the elastic electron scattering
data of Ref. [63]. Our predictions describe experimental
data remarkably well for q (cid:46) 2 fm−
1, validating our ap-
proach. We also compared with the predictions of Payne
et al. [36] where form factors are calculated within a
coupled–cluster theory from ﬁrst principles, using a chi-
ral NNLOsat interaction. At higher q, q (cid:38) 2 fm−
1, both
predictions diverge from experimental data. Note that

After validating our approach, we make predictions for
the weak form factor of 40Ar in Fig. 8. There is no data
available for the weak form factor on argon yet. We com-
pare our predictions with the nuclear theory prediction
of Payne et al. [36] and Yang et al. [37]. We also compare
with two phenomenological form factors which are widely
used in the CEνNS community: the Klein–Nystrand [34]
form factor that is adapted by the COHERENT collab-
oration and the Helm form factor [35]. Note that we
also show an adapted version of the Klein–Nystrand form

In order to appreciate which values of momentum
transfer q are involved at diﬀerent neutrino energies, as
well as to see at which q values the diﬀerences in the
nuclear modeling start causing discrepancies in reaction
strength predictions, we plot cumulative cross sections for
40Ar at several neutrino energies and for diﬀerent mod-
els in Fig. 10. This is deﬁned as the total cross section
strength, integrated up to a cutoﬀ value qcutof f in the
momentum transfer:

≈

The model diﬀerences become stronger for increasingly
high energies with discrepancies originating from the
higher–q regions of the elastic form factor. The range of
cutoﬀ values also coincides with all kinematically avail-
able momentum transfers. At 100 MeV e.g., 40Ar is only
probed up to q

1fm−

1.

In Fig. 11, we show diﬀerential cross sections on 40Ar
as a function of recoil energy T , and scattering angle
θf , for diﬀerent incoming neutrino energies according to
Eq. (9) and (10). For comparison, we have also plotted
the case with no nuclear structure eﬀects i.e. F (Q2) = 1.
The eﬀects of nuclear structure physics are more promi-
nent as the neutrino energy increases. Most of the cross
section strength lies in the lower-end of the recoil energy
and in the forward scattering as the cross section falls
oﬀ rapidly at higher T (top panels) and higher θf values
(bottom panels). Most CEνNS detectors are sensitive
only to the recoil energy deposited in the detector but,
in principle, in the future more advanced detector tech-
nologies might enable measurement of both nuclear recoil
and angular distribution simultaneously. Utilizing such
additional information can be valuable in disentangling
new physics signals in CEνNS experiments [40].

In Fig. 8, we come back to the diﬀerences between var-
ious predictions. Diﬀerent form factor approaches are
based on diﬀerent representations of the nuclear den-
sities, with no experimental data to constrain neutron
distributions. Identifying the size of the diﬀerences be-
tween various theoretical predictions is crucial as experi-
ments have to assign any deviation from expected event
rates either to new physics or to unconstrained nuclear
physics. We compare ﬁve predictions. These include
three nuclear theory approaches: the HF–SkE2 calcu-
lation of this work, the predictions of Payne et al. [36]
where form factors are calculated within a coupledcluster
theory from ﬁrst principles using a chiral NNLOsat inter-

form factors are predicted within a relativistic mean–
ﬁeld model informed by the properties of ﬁnite nuclei
and neutron stars. They also contain two phenomenolog-
ical approaches: the Helm [35] and Klein–Nystrand [34]
form factors where density distributions are represented
by analytical expression.

In the Helm approach [35] the density distribution is
described as a convolution of a uniform nucleonic density
with a given radius and a Gaussian proﬁle characterized
by the folding width s, accounting for the nuclear skin
thickness. The resulting form factor is expressed as:

An adapted version of the KN form factor is often used,
where RA is deﬁned as RA =
k utilizing mea-
sured proton rms radii r0 of the nucleus [15, 66]. We show
both the standard and the adapted (ad.) KN form fac-
tor. For the adapted we use r0 = 3.427 fm, the measured
proton rms radii of 40Ar [27].

form factors and the CEνNS cross section due to dif-

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The experimental observation of coherent elastic
neutrino–nucleus scattering processes by the COHER-
ENT collaboration has inspired physicists across many
ﬁelds. The power of CEνNS as a probe of BSM physics
and its potential for determining neutron density distri-
butions is being realized. The main uncertainty in the
evaluation of the CEνNS cross sections is driven by the
weak form factor that encodes the entire nuclear struc-
ture contribution to the CEνNS cross section.

We presented microscopic nuclear structure physics
calculations of charge and weak nuclear form factors and
the CEνNS cross section on 12C, 16O, 40Ar, 56Fe and
208Pb nuclei. We obtain neutron (proton) densities and
weak (charge) form factors by solving the Hartree–Fock

equations with a Skyrme (SkE2) nuclear potential. Our
predictions for 208Pb and 40Ar charge form factors de-
scribe elastic electron scattering data remarkably well.

After validating 40Ar charge form factor calculations,
we make predictions for the 40Ar weak form factor.
Thereby, we calculate diﬀerential cross section as a func-
tion of recoil energy and neutrino scattering angle. We
attempt to gauge the level of theoretical uncertainty per-
taining to the description of 40Ar form factor and CEνNS
cross section by comparing relative diﬀerences between
recent nuclear theory and widely–used phenomenological
form factor predictions. We compare our 40Ar predic-
tion with recent measurements of the COHERENT col-
laboration. Future precise measurements of CEνNS with
ton and multi-ton detectors will aid in constraining neu-
tron densities and weak nuclear form factor that will in
turn improve prospects of extracting new physics through
CEνNS.
