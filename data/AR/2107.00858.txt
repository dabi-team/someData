Abstract

The long-term stability in terms of gain and energy resolution of a prototype

triple Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector has been investigated with

high rate X-ray irradiation. Premixed Ar/CO2 (80:20) and (90:10) gases

have been used for this stability study. A strong Fe55 X-ray source is used

to irradiate the chamber. The uniqueness of this work is that the same

source has been used to irradiate the GEM prototype and also to monitor

the spectra. This arrangement is important since it reduces the mechanical

complexity of using an X-ray generator as well as the cost of the setup.

A small area of the chamber is exposed continuously to the X-ray for the

entire duration of the operation. The eﬀect of temperature and pressure on

the gain and energy resolution is monitored. The result of the long-term

stability test for a triple GEM detector using Ar/CO2 (70:30) gas mixture

has been reported earlier [1]. The results with Ar/CO2 (80:20) and (90:10)

gas mixtures for the same chamber are presented in this article.

Introduction

Gas Electron Multiplier detectors are being used in many High Energy Physics

experiments as tracking devices for their high rate capability [2][3][4]. The

Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) [5] experiment at the future Facil-

ity for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) [6], Darmstadt, Germany will

use the triple GEM detector as a tracking device in the MUon CHam-

ber (MUCH) [7][8][9][10] to track the di-muon pairs originating from the

decay of low mass vector mesons, which will give us the information about

the ﬁreball created after the collision. Triple GEM detectors will be used

in the ﬁrst two stations of MUCH because the rate will be very high (∼1.0

MHz/cm2 for the ﬁrst station [11]) there. The motivation of this particu-

lar work is to understand how the chamber behaves under continuous high

irradiation [1][12][13]. The stability study in terms of gain and energy reso-

lution of a triple GEM detector has been carried out with Ar/CO2 (80:20)

and (90:10) gas mixtures and results are presented in this paper.

2 Experimental details

A double mask triple GEM detector prototype obtained from CERN, having

dimensions 10 cm×10 cm, has been used for this study. The drift, transfer

and induction gaps of the detector are kept at 3 mm, 2 mm, 2 mm, respec-

tively. The high voltage is distributed between the drift plane and individual

GEM foils using a voltage divider resistor chain. The signal is collected us-

ing a sum up board from all the segmented readout pads, each of dimensions

2

9 mm × 9 mm. It is fed to a charge sensitive preampliﬁer (VV50-2) hav-

ing a gain of 2 mV/fC and shaping time of 300 ns [14]. The output of the

preampliﬁer is fed to the linear Fan In Fan Out (FIFO) module. One output

of the linear FIFO is fed to a Single Channel Analyzer (SCA) for rate mea-

surement and the other output is fed to a Multi-Channel Analyzer (MCA)

to obtain the energy spectrum. The SCA is operated in integral mode and

the threshold is set at 0.1 V to reject noise. The output of the SCA is fed

to the TTL-NIM adapter to convert the TTL signal to NIM signal and then

counted by a NIM scaler.

Premixed Ar/CO2 (80:20) and (90:10) gases have been used at a constant

ﬂow rate for this study. ∆V∼ 359 V and 331 V across each GEM foil were

maintained throughout the experiment for (80:20) and (90:10) gas mixtures,

respectively. A perspex collimator having an area of ∼13 mm2 has been used

to irradiate the chamber at a rate of ∼250 kHz. The results obtained for the

(80:20) and (90:10) gas mixture are given in the next section.

3 Results

The gain and energy resolution have been calculated from the F e55 5.9 keV

peak and then normalization is done using T/p correction as reported ear-

lier [1]. The stability test of the detector has been carried out for ∼30 hours

and ∼140 hours with Ar/CO2 (80:20) and (90:10) gas mixtures, respectively.

Figure 1 and 2 show the variation of gain and the energy resolution of

the prototype as a function of time along with the ratio of ambient tem-

perature (T=t+273) and pressure (p) for (80:20) and (90:10) gas mixtures,

malized energy resolution as a function of the charge accumulated per unit

The variation in the normalized gain and energy resolution has been found

to be ∼10% for both the (80:20) and (90:10) gas mixtures as shown in ﬁgure

4 Conclusions

A systematic study on the stability of gain and energy resolution of a proto-

type triple GEM detector in long term operation under a high rate of X-ray

irradiation has been carried out with Ar/CO2 (80:20) and (90:10) gas mix-

tures. For this study, the same Fe55 source is used to irradiate the chamber

as well as to measure the gain and energy resolution at an interval of 10

minutes. Using a collimator, the chamber is irradiated with a particle rate of

∼20 kHz/mm2 for ∼30 hours with Ar/CO2 (80:20) gas mixture and for ∼140

hours with Ar/CO2 (90:10) gas mixture which are equivalent to a charge ac-

cumulation of 0.6 mC/mm2 and 1.8 mC/mm2, respectively. No degradation

is observed in gain and energy resolution other than a ﬂuctuation of ∼10%

after the long exposure to X-ray.
