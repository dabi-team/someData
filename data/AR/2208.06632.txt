INTRODUCTION 

The  COVID-19  pandemic  helps  us  appreciate  the  role  of  technology  more  than  ever, 
particularly the things we take for granted, such as the way we interact with things and 
with  one  another.  Rapid  technological  progress  is  a  highlight  during  this  period, 
particularly  in  multiple  industries.  Businesses,  for  example,  are  looking  for  new  and 
existing technologies to enhance their business processes and practices. In recent years, 
technological  innovations  have  also  played  pivotal  roles  and  shifted  paradigms  in  how 
businesses  integrate  and  engage  their  customers  about  their  services  and  products 
(Muratovski,  2015).  E-commerce  offers  a  great  opportunity  for  any  business  because  it 
delivers flexibility in terms of time and location. Customers use e-commerce applications 
to buy stuff online where there is a vast range of products and services (Geetha & Rathi, 
2020). Also, it provides convenience and saves time since customers can buy any product 
from their offices, in the comfort of their homes, or anywhere in the world through the 
use of the internet (Rahman et al., 2018). 

Augmented  Reality  (AR)  is  one  of  the  emerging  technologies  for  ecommerce  in  the 
21st century (Yamin, 2019; Young & Smith, 2016). The popularity of AR on mobile devices 
is  due  to  advancements  in  smartphone  technology  (Sudarshan,  2018).  Also,  AR  has 
matured  significantly  over  time,  from  the  conceptual  belief  that  augmented  reality 
answers the important technical obstacles by creating applications that augment virtual 
objects  in  the  real  world  that  are  entertaining  and  usable  (Aljojo  et  al.,  2020;  Gjøsæter, 
2015;  Young  &  Smith,  2016).   With  the  number  of  devices  that  AR  is  capable  of,  as 
reflected in billions of downloads of Google Play Services, AR could change the way we 
do  business  online.  For  example,  AR  can  bring  life  to  a  product  and  provide  immersive 
content  (Berryman,  2012;  Yim  et  al.,  2017;  Oh  et  al.,  2008).  It  also  creates  a  sense  of 
presence for objects that are not really there (Jung et al., 2015; Krevelen & Poelman, 2010; 
Yim  et  al.,  2017).  As  a  result,  virtual  objects  merged  with  AR  affect  the  decisions  of 
possible  customers  a  lot  more  than  the  images  and  videos  usually  used  in  traditional  e-
commerce  experiences  (Abrar,  2018;  Flavián  et  al.,  2019).  Applications  with  AR  offer  a 
great experience and improve customer engagement by enabling the ability to customize 

2 

 
 
  
 
 
 
customers’ preferences (Baytar et al., 2020; Berryman, 2012; Flavián et al., 2019; Richter & 
Raška,  2017;  Yaoyuneyong  et  al.,  2016;  Yim  et  al.,  2017;  Oh  et  al.,  2008)  while  allowing 
customers to explore their options while buying through an online application (Richter & 
Raška,  2017).  Another  example  is  that,  AR-integrated  advertisements  are  favored  over 
traditional advertisements among potential customers (Bilgili et al., 2019). 

Likewise, AR  allows  the  improvement  of  the  real  world by  placing a  virtual  object  in 
real-time (Baytar et al., 2020; Carmigniani & Furht, 2011; El-Seoud & Taj-Eddin, 2019). Such 
innovations could also evoke higher purchase intentions (Abrar, 2018; Adam & Pecorelli, 
2018; Baytar et al., 2020; Richter & Raška, 2017), provide new opportunities (Carvalho et 
al., 2011; El-Seoud & Taj-Eddin, 2019; Richter & Raška, 2017) for businesses to reach out to 
customers  (Carmigniani  &  Furht,  2011),  develop  possibilities  for  the  customer’s 
engagement (Abrar, 2018; Baytar et al., 2020; El-Seoud & Taj-Eddin, 2019; Yaoyuneyong et 
al.,  2016),  add  value  to  their  products  (Flavián  et  al.,  2019),  and  stay  ahead  of  the 
competition (Abrar, 2018; El-Seoud & Taj-Eddin, 2019; Oh et al., 2004). In addition, Lu and 
Smith (2008) said that AR can be used to provide more accurate information on products 
like  furniture,  jewelry,  accessories,  and  other  decorative  products  that  need  space  and 
use volume (Carvalho et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2008). AR technology also provides the user 
the power to make better decisions when purchasing these kinds of products. Accenture 
discovered  in  a  more  recent  survey  on  the  use  of  AR  in  e-commerce  that  88%  of 
customers  indicated  that  the  use  of  AR  in  furniture  businesses  will  likely  increase  their 
intention  to  purchase  a  furniture  product  (Accenture,  2014).  This  was  supported  by 
Flavián  et  al.  (2019),  which  said  that  by  incorporating  AR  technology,  businesses  can 
optimize the user experience for purchasing things (Oh et al., 2004; Oh et al., 2008). For 
example, AR technology can enhance the customer's buying experience in pre-purchase 
scenarios, wherein the customer may view a product in real-time located in their chosen 
places based on the color of the paint on their walls and ceiling and other decorations in 
their house. As mentioned by Baytar et al. (2020), AR could be used to improve the online 
shopping experience, which can lead to higher revenues (Bucko et al., 2018). 

This prompts the study to develop a mobile application with a product preview using 
AR  for  made-to-order  products. It  aims  to  provide  a  platform  for  furniture  and  fixtures 
businesses  to promote their products  by  giving  customers  the  power  to  personally  feel 
and evaluate the product at their own time and place, which in turn enhances customers’ 
engagement  and  buying  experience.  Specifically,  the  study  focused  on  1)  designing  and 
developing a website; 2) developing and integrating a mobile-based application using AR 
technology  specifically  for  furniture  and  fixture  businesses;  and  3)  evaluating  the 
compliance  of  the  mobile  application  to  International  Organization  for  Standardization 
(ISO) 25010.

METHODOLOGY 

The  study  used  a  mixed-method  for  identifying  the  design  considerations  of  the  AR 
mobile application. The study adopted the contextual design approach. This method was 
followed  to  ensure  that  it  supports  and  meets  the  needs  of  the  intended  users  (i.e., 
furniture  business  owners  and  potential  customers)  (Holtzblatt  &  Beyer,  1997).  In  the 
qualitative  part  of  the  study,  an  interview  with  three  informants  (i.e.,  production  staff, 
secretary, and store manager) was initiated. These informants were selected due to their 
experience, involvement, and existing knowledge of the made-to-order furniture business. 
The  informants  were  asked  about  the  existing  processes  regarding  their  ordering 
procedures  and  the  issues  they  usually  faced  during  inquiries  related  to  the  made-to-
order products. Questions related to the possible functionalities that might be helpful to 
their  business  were  also  asked.  All  the  interviews  lasted  about  10  to  30  minutes.  A 
clarification  interview  was  also  conducted  during  the  development  process  in  order  to 
ensure  that  the  application  caters  to  the  needs  of  the  intended  users. Video  recordings 
were  utilized  with  the  proper  consent  of  the  informants  to  document  all  of  their 
responses. 

For the quantitative study, the developed application was evaluated by 35 customers 
(i.e., 10 potential and 15 existing customers), five staff, and five IT experts using a 4-point 
Likert scale (4 being the highest) and selected ISO 25010 quality standards (i.e., Functional 
Suitability, Usability, and Portability) (see Table 1). Responses from the questionnaire are 
coded  as  "strongly  disagree",  "disagree",  "agree"  and  "strongly  agree".  A  verbal 
interpretation ranged from 4 as highly acceptable to 1 as not acceptable. The evaluation 
was purposive in nature and was conducted in Pampanga in different locations over one 
week. The overall mean rating of the evaluations was then reported.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

Development of the E-commerce Website 

Based on the series of interviews among the key informants, the website should have 
the  following  main  features:  1)  display  available  furniture  and  services;  2)  improve 
customer  interaction;  and  3)  provide  automation  for  processing  customer  orders  and 
furniture  delivery.  Figure  1  showcases  the  main  categories  of  furniture,  namely:  living 
room, dining set, garden set furniture, and day bed. According to the informants, these 
four (4) furniture types are their main products. 

Figure 1. Home page 

According  to  the  informants,  the  website  should  also  be  able to  showcase  featured 
furniture  (Figure  2).  This  way,  the  future  customer  will  be  able  to  see  what  kind  of 
furniture  the  business  usually  creates.  The  website  also  has  the  ability  to  purchase 
products  online,  track  the  production  status  of  made-to-order  furniture,  and  customize 
and  personalize  furniture  before  purchase.  This  is  consistent  with  the  study  of  Lu  and 
Smith  (2008)  that  found  that  these  kinds  of  features  would  greatly  increase  the 
customer's comfort in buying and purchasing furniture online.

Development of Mobile Application and Integration of AR Technology 

One  of  the  main  problems  on  an  e-commerce  website  was  that  the  videos  and 
pictures  that  advertise  certain  products  like  furniture  are  different  from  the  actual 
product.  Specifically,  size  and  color  that  complement  the  interior  of  the  house.  This 
warranted the study to use AR technology to help both the customer and the furniture 
business  owner  ease  the  problem  mentioned.  Suggestions  based  on  the  interviews 
related to these served as a guide in the development of the mobile application with AR 
technology.  The  prototype  was  developed  in  Unity  3D,  while  the  AR  technology 
integration  utilizes  the  Vuforia  engine.  The  3D  drawings  initially  used  in  the  prototype 
were  provided  by  the  informants  and  recreated  and  modeled  using  the  SketchUp 
software. This integration paved the way for the application to be capable of previewing 
the  products  directly  to  the  desired  location  using  the  actual  sizes  and  designs  before 
purchase.  According  to  the  informants,  this  feature  is  needed  as  it  can  help  both  the 
customer  and  the  business  owner  visualize  the  desired  product,  thus  enhancing  the 
customer's buying experience (Figure 3).

Prototype Evaluation  

Table  2  shows  that  the  application  is  rated  as  highly  acceptable  among  the 
respondents  of  the  study.  This  rating  was  observed  in  several  aspects  of  the  ISO  25010 
quality  standards.  For  functionality,  the  product  was  able  to  provide  real-time 
experiences in terms of the product position (Mean = 3.84, n = 35) and scale (Mean = 3.84, 
n  =  35),  which  was  in  previewing  the  actual  product.  In  terms  of  its  product  preview 
feature, the application was also rated as being consistent with real-world (Mean = 3.80, 
n  =  35).  Additionally,  the  ability  to  monitor  the  product  status  and  development  was 
evaluated  as  highly  acceptable  (Mean  =  4.0,  n  =  35).  This  indicates  that  the  AR  mobile 
application  provides  a  real-time  experience  for  both  customers  and  business  owners, 
making  the  process  of  purchase  and  visualization  seamless  in  terms  of  customer 
engagement  and  buying  experience. For  usability, both  the  website  and the  application 
were user-friendly (Mean = 3.72, n = 35), provided clear instruction, particularly in terms of 
its navigation features (Mean = 3.76, n = 35), and the ability to showcase and preview the 
product in a desired location and track production status. The usability of the application 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
was evaluated as highly acceptable in terms of its ability to visualize products in real-time 
that improve the buying experience for both the customer and the business owner. For 
portability, the application can easily be moved to another location and can be accessed 
anytime  using  an  internet  connection.  This  indicates  that  the  application  was  readily 
available  anytime  and  anywhere  whenever  the  customer  felt  the  need  to  evaluate  the 
product inside the house, in the garden, or any other place where they desired.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

The mobile application was evaluated as highly acceptable across three selected ISO 
25010 standards. It showed that AR technology provides a way for businesses to enhance 
their  customers'  buying  experiences.  The  study  has  also  shown  that  real-time  status 
updates  and  product  previews  based  on  the  desired  location  of  the  made-to-order 
product  were  the  most  sought-after  features  in  the  furniture  business.  The  study  also 
highlighted  the  use  of  AR-related  technology  in  this  case,  which  has  the  capability  to 
further improve the customer buying experience. Future studies may include using newer 
technologies  (e.g.,  mixed  reality)  to  improve  the  application,  as  well  as  using  the  same 
technology on other business entities that require product visualization. 

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS 

The study showed that AR-related technologies could be helpful to local industries in 
the  Philippines.  It  also  shows  that  such  technology  can  be  used  by  specific  business 
models like made-to-order furniture, where instantaneous replies and spatial information 
are needed. Moreover, the study also shows that businesses, regardless of context, can 
connect with their potential consumers using emerging technologies like AR.
