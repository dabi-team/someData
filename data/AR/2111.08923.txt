AN EFFICIENT ITERATION FOR THE EXTREMAL SOLUTIONS
OF DISCRETE-TIME ALGEBRAIC RICCATI EQUATIONS

CHUN-YUEH CHIANG∗ AND HUNG-YUAN FAN†

Abstract. Algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) have been extensively applicable in linear op-
timal control problems and many eﬃcient numerical methods were developed. The most attention
of numerical solutions is the (almost) stabilizing solution in the past works. Nevertheless, it is an
interesting and challenging issue in ﬁnding the extremal solutions of AREs which play a vital role
in the applications. In this paper, based on the semigroup property, an accelerated ﬁxed-point it-
eration (AFPI) is developed for solving the extremal solutions of the discrete-time algebraic Riccati
equation. In addition, we prove that the convergence of the AFPI is at least R-suplinear with order
r > 1 under some mild assumptions. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the feasibility and
eﬃciency of the proposed algorithm.

If (A, B) is stabilizable and (A, C) is detectable, which are standard assumptions
in the LQ optimal control problem mentioned previously, then

this case, there are dozens of numerical methods for solving the DAREs with small
to medium sizes in the literature, see, e.g., [5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 20, 21] and the references
therein. The standard way for computing the stabilizing solution is to utilize the

On the other hand, regarding the DARE (1.1a) or (1.1b) as a nonlinear matrix

It is well known that the set

with the partial ordering “

Recently, it is shown in Theorem 5.1 of [24] that the existence and uniqueness of
the minimal solution to the DARE (1.1a) can be constructed iteratively, through a
Newton-type iteration for computing the maximal solution to the dual DARE (1.2),
when rank [A
and A is nonsingular. In this paper,
\{
applying the methodology of the ﬁxed-point iteration (FPI), we we will give construc-
tive proofs for the existence (or uniqueness) theorems of these four extremal solutions
to the DARE under some wild and reasonable assumptions. More restrictive assump-
tions have been addressed in [6] for the uniqueness of the maximal solution to the
DARE (1.1b)under the framework of the FPI. Starting with some appropriate initial
matrices, we will develop the accelerated ﬁxed-point iteration (AFPI), based on the
2 [17], for comput-
semigroup property of the DARE with an integer parameter r
Nn simultaneously. Speciﬁcally,
ing the extermal elements (X, Y ) of the set
the AFPI with the initial X0 = 0 is just the SDA presented in [5] when r = 2. In
analogous way, a variant of the AFPI will be derived from the dual DARE (1.2) for
Nn simultaneously, if (A, B)
solving the extremal elements (
Y ) of the set
is antistabilizable and A is nonsingular.
The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2 we present some preliminary
lemmas that will be used in our main theorems. Under some wild assumptions, the

existence (or uniqueness) of the extremal solutions to the DARE will be constructed
iteratively via the standard FPI in Section 3. Moreover, based on the framework of
the semigroup property for the DARE (1.1b), two accelerated variants of the FPI
Nn,
will be proposed for computing the extremal elements of
respectively, and will discuss the rate of convergence for the AFPI presented in this
section. In Section 4 some illustrate examples are presented for demonstrating the
feasibility and eﬃciency of the proposed AFPI(r) with diﬀerent values of r. Finally,
we conclude this paper in Section 5.

computing the positive semideﬁnite extremal solutions of the DARE (1.1). On the

Example 5.1. Let the coeﬃcient matrices of DARE (1.1b) be given by

Then it is easily seen that the pair (A, B) is stabilizable, but (A, C) is not detectable.
Moreover, this DARE (1.1b) has only two positive semideﬁnite solutions, namely,

BF is d-stable and

X0 is determined
by (5.1), then the numerical results of AFPI(2) and NTM are presented in Table 1
and Table 2, respectively, where A0 = A, G0 = BBH and H0 = H are required

Notice that, after 4 iterations, the AFPI(2) generates accurate approximations
to the maximal and minimal positive semideﬁnite solutions of the DARE (1.1b) si-
multaneously, but NTM merely computes an approximation to the solution X+,M .
Since the exact maximal solution is unknown, we may apply the MATLAB command

6. Concluding remarks. In most of the past works, it is always assumed that
the DARE has a unique maximal positive semideﬁnite solution X with ρ(TX )
1 and
another meaningful solutions are lacking in brief discussion. Our contribution ﬁlls in
the existing gap in ﬁnding four extremal solutions of the DARE. More precisely, we
have studied the existence of minimal and maximum solutions under mild assump-
tions.
It is important to note that we no longer need the traditional assumptions
on the distribution of the spectrum of the symplectic matrix pencil or Popov matrix
function, but give mathematical conditions from diﬀerent point of view.

≤

This paper concerns comprehensive convergence analysis of the most recent ad-
vanced algorithms AFPI, including its variant SDA, for solving the extremal solutions
of DARE. We verify that the AFPI works eﬃciently and the convergence speed is
R-superlinear under the mild assumptions. As compared to the previous works, the
theoretical results presented here are merely deduced from the framework of the ﬁxed-
point iteration, using basic assumptions and elementary matrix theory. We believe

the results we obtain are novel on this topic and could provide considerable insights
into the study of unmixed solutions of DARE.
