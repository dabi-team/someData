Recent results and future of the NA61/SHINE strong
interactions program

NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target experiment at the CERN Super-Proton-
Synchrotron. The main goals of the experiment are to discover the critical
point of strongly interacting matter and to study the properties of the
onset of deconﬁnement.
In order to reach these goals the collaboration
studies hadron production properties in nucleus-nucleus, proton-proton and
proton-nucleus interactions.

In this talk, recent results on particle production in p+p interactions, as
well as Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions in the SPS energy range, are reviewed.
The results are compared with available world data. The future of the
NA61/SHINE scientiﬁc program is also presented.

1. Introduction

The NA61/SHINE experiment performs a unique two-dimensional scan
of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. The main goals are
the study of the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement by measurements
of hadron production and the search for the critical point of strongly inter-
acting matter by measuring event-by-event ﬂuctuations. Measurements are
performed in a wide beam momentum range (from 13 up to 150/158A GeV/c)
and for various systems (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La and Pb+Pb).
The program is motivated by the discovery of the onset of deconﬁnement in
Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c by the NA49 experiment [1, 2].

NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target experiment at the CERN SPS [3]. The
detection system is based on eight Time Projection Chambers (TPC) pro-
viding acceptance in the full forward hemisphere, down to pT = 0. The
TPCs allow for tracking, momentum and charge reconstruction as well as
measurement of mean energy loss per unit path length. Time of Flight
(ToF) walls provide additional particle identiﬁcation by measuring particles

mass. The Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD), a zero-degree calorimeter,
allows selecting collision centrality based on the measurement of forward en-
ergy. The full detector system of the NA61/SHINE experiment is presented
in Fig. 1.

2. Onset of deconﬁnement

One of the main purposes of NA61/SHINE is to study the phase tran-
sition between hadron gas (HG) and quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The mea-
surements concentrate on observables for which the Statistical Model of the
Early Stage (SMES) predicts characteristic signals [4].

Mean multiplicities of all pions, hπi, normalized to the average number
of wounded nucleons, hWi, are shown in Fig. 2. The results were compared
with world data from other experiments [5–7]. At higher SPS energies the
slope of the energy dependence is larger for the heavy systems (Pb+Pb,
Ar+Sc) than for the light ones (p+p, Be+Be). SMES predicts an increase
of the slope in the quark-gluon plasma due to a larger number of degrees of
freedom. All A+A data come from central collisions.

Fig. 3 presents the multiplicity ratio of charged kaons to pions at mid-
rapidity. Fig. 4 shows the energy dependence of the inverse slope parameter

of transverse mass spectra of charged kaons. NA61/SHINE results on p+p
interactions [8] and Be+Be collisions were compared with results from cen-
tral Pb+Pb collisions from NA49 [1, 2] and other experiments [9–14].

A plateau visible in the energy dependence of the inverse slope param-
eter in Fig. 4, and peaks seen in Fig. 3 (left panel) for Pb+Pb and Au+Au
collisions in the SPS energy range, were predicted by the SMES model as
signatures of the onset of deconﬁnement.
In the SPS energy range the
NA61/SHINE results on p+p interactions exhibit a qualitatively similar en-
ergy dependence (step) for the inverse slope parameter, and a step instead

of a peak in the kaon-to-pion ratio. Thus some properties of hadron pro-
duction previously attributed to the onset of deconﬁnement in heavy-ion
collisions are present also in p+p interactions. Surprisingly, while the in-
verse slope parameter in Be+Be collisions lies slightly above that in p+p
interactions, the values of the charged-kaon-to-pion ratio are very close in
Be+Be and p+p reactions.

3. Search for the critical point

NA61/SHINE uses the strongly intensive measures Σ[PT , N ] and ∆[PT , N ]

to study transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations [15]. Within
the Wounded Nucleon Model, they depend neither on the number of wounded
nucleons (W) nor on ﬂuctuations of W. Moreover, in the Grand Canonical
Ensemble, they do not depend on volume and volume ﬂuctuations. Σ[PT , N ]
and ∆[PT , N ] have two reference values, namely, they are equal to zero in
case of no ﬂuctuations and one in case of independent particle production.
Fig. 5 shows deviations of Σ[PT , N ] and ∆[PT , N ] from unity (independent
particle model) that are smoothly growing with energy, which may be due to
the increasing azimuthal acceptance. So far, there are no prominent struc-
tures in the NA61/SHINE data which could be related to the critical point
(see the expected signal from the critical point in Fig. 5, upper panel).

4. NA61/SHINE detector upgrade

This year NA61/SHINE started a pilot program of open charm mea-

surements with the new Small Acceptance Vertex Detector (SAVD).

The construction of a high-resolution vertex detector was mostly moti-
vated by the importance and the possibility of the ﬁrst direct measurements
of open charm meson production in heavy-ion collisions at SPS energies. In
the ﬁrst step a limited-acceptance version of the detector, named SAVD,
was built. This device covers 35% of the acceptance of the ﬁnal version,
and is foreseen to operate beyond 2020. The constructed SAVD is based on
MIMOSA-26AHR sensors developed in IPHC Strasbourg.

A detector upgrade is planned during the long shutdown LS2 at CERN
during the years 2019–2020: the readout speed will be increased to 1 kHz
and the Large Acceptance Vertex Detector will be constructed.

The upgraded detector will allow a high-statistics beam momentum scan
with Pb+Pb collisions for precise measurements of D-meson production and
multi-strange hyperon production in 2021–2024.

5. Summary

This contribution brieﬂy discusses recent results from the NA61/SHINE
energy and system size scan performed to study the onset of deconﬁnement
and search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter. Results on
produced particle multiplicity and ﬂuctuations were presented.

The measured ﬂuctuations show no indication of a critical point. Still,
such features may be revealed in future results on Xe+La and Pb+Pb col-
lisions.

In addition, the extension of the NA61/SHINE program, such as the
detector system upgrade and plans to measure precisely open charm in
2021–2024, were discussed in this contribution.
