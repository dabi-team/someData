High intensity monoenergetic muon neutrinos of energy 236 MeV from kaon decay at rest (KDAR)
at the medium energy proton accelerator facilities like J-PARC and Fermilab are proposed to be used
for making precision measurements of neutrino-nucleus cross sections in 12C and 40Ar and perform
neutrino oscillation experiments in νµ → νµ and νµ → νe modes. In view of these developments, we
study the theoretical uncertainties arising due to the nuclear medium eﬀects in the neutrino-nucleus
cross sections as well as in the angular and energy distributions of the charged leptons produced in
the charged current (CC) induced reactions by νµ and νe in 12C and 40Ar in the energy region of
Eνe(νµ) < 300 MeV. The calculations have been done in a microscopic model using the local density
approximation which takes into account the nuclear eﬀects due to the Fermi motion, binding energy
and long range correlations. The results are compared with the other calculations available in the
literature.

νs by preforming the oscillation experiments in νµ

The two body leptonic decay mode of the charged kaon decay-at-rest (KDAR) i.e. K +

1.1% [1]
provides a unique and important source of monoenergetic muon neutrinos of energy 236 MeV. These neutrinos may
be used to make high precision measurements of neutrino-nucleus cross sections for the charged current (CC) induced
weak quasielastic (QE) production of muons from the various nuclear targets. The high precision neutrino-nucleus
cross section measured with the well deﬁned monoenergetic beam of muon neutrinos may serve as benchmark for
validating many theoretical models currently being used to describe the nuclear medium eﬀects in QE reactions [2, 3]
relevant for the analysis of present day neutrino experiments in the low energy region of a few hundred MeVs [4–21].
These KDAR neutrinos are proposed to be used as a probe to study the new neutrino oscillation modes to sterile
neutrinos i.e. νµ
νµ disappearance mode and studying the
CC interactions of νµ with nuclei and/or performing the oscillation experiments in νµ
νe appearance mode and
studying the CC interaction of νe with nuclei
νµ disappearance mode, νµ from the three body
Kµ3 decays of charged kaons i.e. K +
µ+π0νµ having continuous energy spectrum with the end point energy of
215 MeV constitute the major source of background while in the νµ
νe appearance mode, νe from the Ke3 decay
e+π0νe, having continuous energy spectrum with end point energy of 228 MeV
mode of charged kaons i.e. K +
constitute the major source of background. The background in both the channels from the decay in ﬂight (DIF)
neutrinos from pions, kaons and other mesons corresponds to higher energies. With suﬃciently improved energy
resolution for the detection of the ﬁnal muon and the electron produced respectively in the CC weak interaction of νµ
and νe with matter, the background events can be well separated in energy from the signal events for the oscillation
experiments corresponding to Eνµ(νe) = 236 MeV. Moreover, it has been recently suggested [22] that the observation
of CC induced QE events with the monoenergetic neutrinos can also provide information about the dark matter which
annihilates in its interaction with the solar matter in the center of the Sun into quark-antiquark pairs and produces
the charged kaons through the hadronization process. The monoenergetic muon neutrinos produced by these charged
kaons through the Kµ2 decays can be identiﬁed by comparing the on-source and oﬀ-source event rates in the terrestrial
detectors provided the background events for Eν
236 MeV are well under control in the ν-oscillation experiments
proposed with the KDAR neutrinos.

The feasibility of such experiments with high intensity KDAR neutrinos requires an accelerator facility capable of
producing K + mesons with a very high yield. The 3 GeV proton accelerator facility at the J-PARC MLF facility in
Tokai, Japan [15–19] and the 8 GeV proton accelerator facility at the BNB source facility at the Fermilab, USA [19–21]
have the suﬃcient energy and power to produce high intensity charged kaons through the primary and/or secondary
interactions of protons with the nuclear targets which would be stopped in the surrounding material and their decay
would give intense beam of νµ. At the J-PARC facility the neutrino oscillation experiments in the appearance mode
i.e. νµ
νµ have been proposed respectively, through the JSNS
experiment by the Japanese group [15–17], and the KPipe experiment by the MIT-Columbia group [18–20] using the
liquid scintillator detector with active detector mass of 17 tons and 684 tons, respectively. At the Fermilab facility
νe has been proposed with 2 kton LArTPC
a neutrino oscillation experiment in the appearance mode i.e. νµ
detector [20, 21].

νe as well as in the disappearance mode i.e. νµ

One of the major sources of systematic errors in these experiments is due to the νµ ﬂux arising from the uncertainty
in the K + production yields in the proton-nucleus interaction predicted by the hadronic models for the kaon production
and could be as large as 75% [18, 19, 23, 24]. The other source of systematic errors is due to the uncertainty in the
nucleus cross sections for Eνµ(νe) = 236 MeV arising due to the nuclear medium eﬀects [2, 3] and is the subject
νµ(νe)
of the present work.

−

The present simulation studies [18–20], for estimating the neutrino oscillation parameters, use the neutrino nucleus
cross sections for the KDAR neutrinos on 12C and 40Ar as predicted by the NuWro generator [25] which are reported
to be about 25% smaller than the predictions by the GENIE Monte Carlo generator [26] and the results of Martini
et al. [27, 28]. In the low energy region, the short range correlations and the meson exchange currents(MEC) are not
expected to play an important role [29–31], but the eﬀects of Pauli blocking, Fermi motion and the long range RPA
correlations are found to be quite important. This has been shown by many theoretical attempts [32–44] made to
12C cross section measured in the LSND experiment [45–47] with the pion decay in ﬂight (DIF) muon
explain the νµ
neutrinos in the energy region of Eνµ < 320 MeV with < Eνµ >= 150 MeV. These eﬀects could therefore be very
important in the energy region of KDAR neutrinos.

When the processes given by Eq. (2) take place in a nucleus, various nuclear medium eﬀects like Pauli blocking,
Fermi motion, binding energy corrections and nucleon correlations, etc. come into play. Moreover, the charged
lepton produced in the ﬁnal state moves in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the residual nucleus and which aﬀects its energy and
momenta. We have taken into account these eﬀects which are brieﬂy discussed below:

1. In the standard treatment of the Fermi Gas Model applied to neutrino reactions the quantum states of the

nucleons inside the nucleus are ﬁlled up to a Fermi momentum pF , given by pF =
density of the nucleus. In a nuclear reaction, the momentum of the initial nucleon p is therefore constrained to
be p < pF and p′(=
F , where pF is the Fermi momentum of the initial nucleon target in the Fermi
sea, and p′
F is the Fermi momentum of the outgoing nucleon. The total energies of the initial(i) and ﬁnal(f )

4. In the nucleus the strength of the electroweak couplings may change from their free nucleon values due to the
presence of strongly interacting nucleons. Conservation of vector current (CVC) forbids any change in the charge
coupling while the magnetic and the axial vector couplings are likely to change from their free nucleon values.
There exists considerable work in understanding the quenching of magnetic moment and axial charge in nuclei
due to nucleon-nucleon correlations. In our approach these are reﬂected in the modiﬁcation of nuclear response
in longitudinal and transverse channels leading to some reduction. We calculate this reduction in the vector-
axial(VA) and axial-axial(AA) response functions due to the long range nucleon-nucleon correlations treated in
the random phase approximation(RPA), which has been diagrammatically shown in Fig.(2).

The weak nucleon current described by Eq.(5) gives in the non-relativistic limit, terms like FA~στ+ and iF V

~σ×~q
which generate spin-isospin transitions in nuclei. While the term iF V
2M τ+ couples with the transverse exci-

tations, the term FA~στ+ couples with the transverse as well as longitudinal channels. These channels produce
diﬀerent RPA responses in the longitudinal and transverse channels due to the diﬀerent NN potential in these

in nuclei
[35, 50, 51, 57]. However, in some recent works, the Valencia group [41, 44, 64] has used the value of
g′ = 0.63. We have, therefore, studied the dependence of g′ on the total cross section as well as lepton energy
and angular distributions by varying g′ in the range of 0.6 to 0.7.
The eﬀect of the ∆ degrees of freedom in the nuclear medium is included in the calculation of the RPA response
by considering the eﬀect of ph-∆h and ∆h-∆h excitations. This is done by replacing UN
N = UN + U∆,
where U∆ is the Lindhard function for the ∆h excitation in the nuclear medium. The expressions for UN and
U∆ are taken from Ref.[65]. The diﬀerent couplings of N and ∆ are incorporated in UN and U∆ and then the
same interaction strengths (Vl and Vt) are used to calculate the RPA response.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

For the numerical calculations, we have used Eq. 24 to obtain the results for the charged current νe and νµ scattering
cross sections on the nuclear targets in the local Fermi gas model(LFGM) with the inclusion of Fermi momentum
and Pauli blocking, and Eq. 27 when RPA eﬀects are also included. Furthermore, we have taken Coulomb distortion
eﬀect on the outgoing charged lepton in both cases using EMA with the Coulomb potential given in Eq. 23.

In Fig. 3, we present the results of νl(l=e, µ) induced charged lepton production cross sections σ vs Eνl in 12C and

The measurement of neutrino-nucleus cross section induced by νµ and νe and the νµ/νe cross section ratio is an
important quantity in the analysis of νµ
νe oscillations in the appearance channel. This ratio also provides an
experimental validation of the theoretical calculations of the various eﬀects arising due to the lepton mass dependent
terms in the standard model specially the pseudoscalar form factors and the second class currents [54, 69] and could
provide possible evidence of muon–electron non-universality. Moreover, this ratio is also a key parameter in improving
the sensitivity of measuring the CP violation phase δCP in the future experiments on neutrino oscillations [70]. We
have plotted in Fig. 7, the ratio of νµ/νe cross section as a function of energy in the low energy region relevant for
the experiments with KDAR neutrinos.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

→

→

νµ and νµ

We have presented a theoretical description of the inclusive quasielastic scattering for νe and νµ scattering induced
by the weak charged current on 12C and 40Ar relevant for the future experiments planned to be done using KDAR
neutrinos. These KDAR neutrinos are monoenergetic with Eνµ =236MeV. The neutrino oscillation experiments in the
νe channels have background from the KDAR neutrinos from the Kµ3 and Ke3 decay modes with
νµ
215MeV and the electron neutrinos with Eνe ≤
the continuous energy spectrum of the muon neutrinos with Eνµ ≤
235MeV. We have therefore studied the nuclear medium eﬀects in the neutrino-nucleus cross sections in the energy
300M eV for QE scattering of νe and νµ from 12C and 40Ar nuclear targets proposed to be used in the
region of Eνl ≤
future experiments planned at the JPARC and Fermilab facilities with liquid scintillator(LS) and LArTPC detectors.
The calculations have been done in a microscopic model of nucleus which takes into account the eﬀect of the Fermi
motion, binding energy and long range nucleon-nucleon correlations through RPA. The method has been earlier
applied successfully to reproduce the low energy neutrino-nucleus cross sections observed in LSND, KARMEN and
LAMPF experiments. The eﬀect of Pauli blocking and RPA correlations is to drastically reduce the cross sections over
the free nucleon case. In the energy region of Eν = 150
250M eV , the overall reduction due to Pauli blocking and
−
RPA correlations in 12C(40Ar) varies from the range of 70%(75%) to 55%(53%) in the case of νe-nucleus scattering
and 95%(85%) to 68%(63%) in the case of νµ-nucleus scattering. There is an uncertainty of about 10% due to the
Landau-Migdal parameter used in the treatment of RPA correlations. The results have been compared with the
results of the other calculations in the literature. The cross section obtained using the present model with RPA eﬀect
is around 50% smaller than the results of the Relativistic Fermi gas model(RFGM) of Smith and Moniz [67]. The
diﬀerent treatment of nucleon-nucleon correlations in the various approaches discussed in section-III results in an
uncertainty of about 25% in the cross sections at Eνµ =236MeV.

We have also presented the results for the energy and angular distributions for e− and µ− produced in these reactions
for a ﬁxed neutrino energy of Eν=236MeV. A comparison with the recent results of Pandey et al. [71] shows that the
diﬀerences in the prediction of these two models are signiﬁcant in the case of the energy distributions of the muons. An
experimental observation of the total cross sections and the diﬀerential cross sections in the forthcoming experiments
will be able to discriminate between various models of treating the nuclear medium eﬀects in the neutrino-nucleus
scattering at low energies.
