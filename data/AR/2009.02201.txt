Abstract We present two diﬀerent techniques for achieving low resistance
(<20 nΩ) contacts between copper and aluminium at cryogenic temperatures.
The best method is based on gold plating of the surfaces in an e-beam evap-
orator immediately after Ar plasma etching in the same apparatus, yielding
resistances as low as 3 nΩ that are stable over time. The second approach in-
volves inserting indium in the Al/Cu joint. For both methods, we believe key
elements are surface polishing, total removal of the aluminum oxide surface
layer, and temporary application of large (typ. 11 kN) compression forces. Such
contacts are not demountable. We believe the values for gold plated contacts
are the lowest ever reported for a Cu/Al joint of a few cm2. This technology
could simplify the construction of thermal links for advanced cryogenics appli-
cations, in particular that of extremely low resistance heat switches for nuclear
demagnetization refrigerators.

1 Introduction

Dry dilution refrigerators have widely spread in laboratories these last years,
opening the mK temperature range to a large community. Yet, some research
ﬁelds still require lower temperatures. As an illustration, a European project
has recently been granted [1] aiming at providing access to platforms in the

micro-kelvin range. Nuclear demagnetization refrigerators (NDRs) pre-cooled
by dry dilution fridges seem a straightforward extension of the temperature
range below 1 mK. Successful developments [2,3] either with Cu or with PrNi5
as nuclear coolant have validated this concept.

NDRs are not intrinsically continuous coolers as they need to be recycled.
In wet dilution refrigerators, i.e. those using liquid helium as a 4.2 K precooling
source, nuclear stages can remain at base temperature typically for a couple
of days or, in some cases, for up to a month (see [4] and references therein).
In these examples, the heat leak is typically well below 1 nW. In dry fridges,
the induced vibrations associated with pulse-tube coolers [5,6] can lead to a
signiﬁcant heat input and values of the order of 5 nW have been reported [2,
3]. For a given setup, this will shorten the experimental time at base temper-
ature. For this main reason, but also since operation in the sub-mK regime
for months would be of interest for some experiments, there is a need for the
development of a continuous nuclear demagnetization refrigerator (CNDR) as
already proposed by Toda et al. [7].

In a previous paper [8], we have presented a CNDR concept based on two
PrNi5 nuclear demagnetization stages (NDSs) mounted in series (see Fig. 1)
and separated by a heat switch. This architecture, aimed at providing contin-
uous operation below 1 mK, is similar to the one used for electronic adiabatic
demagnetization refrigerators for space applications [9]. According to our sim-
ulations [8], the thermal link between the 2 stages is the most critical point:
its thermal resistance must be minimized. This is detailed in the following
section.

Fig. 1 Overview of the Continuous Nuclear Demagnetisation Refrigerator (CNDR). DR
stands for Dilution Refrigerator and NDS stands for Nuclear Demagnetisation Stage. Note
that, for clarity, the coils around the NDSs and the superconducting heat switches are not
represented.

In a more recent paper [10], we have compared parallel and series conﬁgu-
rations. Although the parallel conﬁguration may provide better performance
and relax the constraint on the thermal link resistance, it requires more space
and is more complex since it requires 4 heat switches instead of 2. Whichever
the selected conﬁguration, the thermal link resistance should be minimized.

In the present work, we report stable Al/Cu contact resistances as small
as 3 nΩ. This achievement may allow construction of superconducting heat
switches with a normal state resistance ≤15 nΩ, which is the lowest value
reported so far [11]. Furthermore, the construction of our gold-plated Al/Cu
joints rely on removal of the aluminum oxide layer by plasma etching and sub-
sequent gold deposition without breaking vacuum. Our process avoids the com-
plicated and potentially dangerous cyanide-based chemistry employed in [11].

2 Thermal link issue

Fig. 2 highlights the criticality of the thermal link between NDS1 and NDS2.
According to the model developed in [8,10] and assuming a minimum ﬁeld-
independent heat leak of 5 nW, it is not possible to maintain a base tem-
perature below 1 mK for a thermal link resistance of 500 nΩ. With 150 nΩ,
the model suggests that the base temperature could be as low as 750 µK for
10 nW losses. It is expected that this provides suﬃcient margin to allow for
uncertainties inherent to the model. As a consequence, this value of 150 nΩ
can be considered an appropriate objective value.

S´ebastien Triqueneaux et al.

In the following, we have used the Wiedemann-Franz law to convert ther-
mal resistances into electrical resistances. As an example, an electrical resis-
tance of 150 nΩ corresponds to a thermal resistance of ≈6000 K/W at 1 mK
which would lead to an acceptable ∆T of 60 µK between the 2 NDS for 10 nW
applied power. Although this law can overestimate the thermal conductivity [9,
12] for some materials or for contact resistances, we assume it is satisfactory
for comparison purposes.

In order to evaluate whether this requirement was achievable, we have
reviewed some of the articles dealing with superconducting heat switches for
NDRs. Results are summarized in Table 1. The equivalent electrical resistances
vary over almost 4 orders of magnitude, but at least 6 systems exhibit values
close to or below 100 nΩ and the lowest reported value is only 15 nΩ. This
suggests that our goal value of 150 nΩ for the entire thermal link between the
2 NDSs might be achievable.

3 Thermal contact issue

Fig. 3 provides a breakdown of the contributors to the thermal link resistance
between the 2 NDSs.

For the determination of the electrical resistances, we have used the fol-

lowing assumptions:

– Wires 1a (wires 1b are considered identical): 6 copper wires of 6N purity
[37], 1.5 mm diameter and 5 cm long. RRRs above 5 000 have been achieved
several times on wires from the same batch after heat treatment. This
results in 16 nΩ per set of wires, so 32 nΩ total contribution for Rw1a and
Rw1b.

– The Heat-Switch will be made of Aluminium. Although its geometry is not
ﬁxed yet, it could be a C-shape block as already used at Lancaster (see
[14] for example) with a section of 15 mm × 5 mm and a thermal path

length of approximately 35 mm. We have measured a RRR of ≈5000 with
6N purity [38] as received. The calculated contribution is ≈2 nΩ.

As a result, and after applying a factor of 2 as a safety margin on the
contributions of the Cu wires and Al heat switch, we end up with a budget of
≈20 nΩ for each of the 4 contact resistances. Once again the question arises
whether such a value is achievable. We have ﬁrst focused our eﬀorts on the
Al/Cu contact resistances (Rc2a and Rc2b in Fig. 3) leaving the PrNi5-Cu
contact for a future step.

Numerous articles provide data on contact resistances between metals (see
for instance [21,22,23,24,25,26]). We limit ourselves to the value of electrical
resistance at low temperatures and do not consider their – sometimes non-
linear – temperature dependence, which is addressed in [26]. We may identify
2 major trends in these data. A general trend is well represented in Fig. 4
taken from Blondelle et al. [21] and dealing with bolted Cu-Cu joints at 4.2 K.
First, the resistances follow a 1/F dependence, where F is the applied Force, in
agreement with theoretical predictions [26]. Furthermore, except for the mea-
surements of Okamoto et al. (see below), values in the range of 100-400 nΩ are
encountered for forces of 3000 N, close to the recommended force for standard
M4 stainless steel bolts [21].

This is consistent with the ”conservative” approximation proposed in [22]
for the thermal conductance of Cu-Cu bolted joints based on several earlier
publications: G = 0.0624×T −0.00023 [WK−1]1. This translates into a contact
resistance Rc of ≈400 nΩ using the Wiedemann-Franz law, which is compa-
rable to the ﬁgure given above. Similar values are also found in [24] where
Salerno and Kittel report thermal conductances for Cu assemblies (not only
Cu-Cu) ranging from 10−3 to ≈10−1 WK−1 at 4.2 K for 670 N applied force.
With a linear dependence of the conductance with the applied force, then the
best values at 3 kN would be close to 200 nΩ, again comparable to the ﬁgure
given above.
Yet, a few authors report signiﬁcantly lower values with diﬀerent preparation
techniques (we provide a detailed table in Appendix):

– Deutsch [27] achieved 77 nΩ by simply pressing copper samples one against

the other.

– Mueller et al. [11] and Shigematsu et al. [28] for Al-Cu contacts used rather
complex procedures making use of a Zincate solution followed by cyanide-
based gold plating. They achieved 5 nΩ in the best conditions.

– Okamoto et al. [29] used non cyanide gold plating solutions.Their best

results – 4 nΩ – were obtained adding an indium ﬁller.

– Willekers et al. [30] used impact welding and achieved 32 nΩ.

Even if these measurements may appear exceptional compared to the large
number of contact resistances above 100 nΩ, they suggest that a Rc of 20 nΩ
for our Al/Cu contacts should be feasible.

Bad contact resistances with Al on one or 2 sides are often explained by
the presence of a few nm Al2O3 hard ﬁlm on the surface of aluminium. Such
a hard oxide layer is diﬃcult to get rid of and is detrimental for thermal
contacts at very low temperatures. In the worst cases, the conductance of the
contact would depart from the T dependence expected for metallic contacts
[26]. Several ways are proposed to remove or disrupt this oxide layer:

– Wanner [31] reports Al to Al contacts with an equivalent electrical resis-
tance of 70 nΩ for rough samples whereas polished samples give about
3 times this value. He suggests that the roughness combined with strong
compression forces makes it possible to break the Al2O3 layer. The Rc =
70 nΩ was obtained for a large torque of 20 Nm onto a M8 screw. This Rc
is too high for our application and applying such a torque is out of range
for our future system (we will use M4 screws at best).

– We have performed tests using magnetic pulse welding inspired by devel-

opments in another ﬁeld [32] but the results were not satisfactory.

– Impact welding, as successfully achieved by Willekers et al.[30] could be a
promising approach, however it is unclear what eﬀect this process might
have on the highly annealed copper and aluminium required for our appli-
cation.

1 It seems surprising that, in this article from Schmitt et al., the conductance would not
depend on the applied force. We suppose that this approximation is valid for their conditions,
i.e. 3 kN.

– It is often proposed to chemically remove the oxide layer and replace it by
a coating (usually gold). The results are sometimes clearly unsatisfactory
when the process is not appropriate [31] but some very good results have
been obtained as in [11,28]. In the chemical oxide removal, a zincate solu-
tion replaces Al2O3 with Zn or Cu and the Al sample can be exposed to
air. It is then gold plated in a separate solution.

– An alternative solution proposed by Shigematsu et al. [28] drew our at-
tention. It consists in using equipment dedicated to micro-electronics in
order to sputter Au onto Al immediately after etching while remaining
under vacuum. Despite their pessimistic conclusion on this approach, we
have decided to investigate that process since we had already succeeded in
removing the oxide layers on Al for other applications [33]. We have also
decided to test Cu-Al connections with indium as a ﬁller.

For clarity, we ﬁrst focus on our successful procedures and results, i.e.
our last runs. Our earlier trial-and-error tests that may provide some useful
information are reported in subsequent sections.

4 Experimental setup

The experimental setup for the samples to be tested is depicted in Fig. 5 and
6. Small rectangular Cu pieces (20 mm × 12 mm × 2.5 mm) are pressed onto
the 2 ends of a bigger Al block (600 mm × 20 mm × 9.7 mm) via 2 SS bars
and 2 × 2 M6 SS screws + Belleville washers (∅i = 6 mm, ∅e = 12.5 mm,
t = 0.7 mm, max. deﬂection 0.4 mm). Smaller screws are screwed into the
diﬀerent materials for current supply or voltage measurement.

In order to establish a reproducible and well controlled tightening proce-
dure, we made some preliminary tests. First, we pressed representative Cu
pieces against an Al block at diﬀerent torques. For each test, we would put a
pressure measurement ﬁlm (Fuji Prescale MS) between the two materials. Al-
though the ﬁlm does not give very quantitative results, it helped us ﬁx 5 Nm
as a minimum torque and underlined the need for alternative tightening of
the screws in order to get a signiﬁcant and homogeneous contact surface. It
also conﬁrmed that our polishing procedure (see below) would give a good
planarity.

Then, we tested and characterised several Belleville washer conﬁgurations.
Belleville washers are needed to ensure that the applied force remains con-
stant while the setup is being cooled down – about 10 µm diﬀerential thermal
contraction was expected for our device. The characterisation of the Belleville
washers was judged necessary ﬁrstly because we could ﬁnd very few technical
data on compression characteristics of standard washers. We applied pressure
on the screw head with a hydraulic press and measured the deﬂection of the
washer assembly. The maximum measured stroke was ≈0.9 mm, close to the
expected 0.8 mm. We could verify that the deﬂection increases linearly with the
applied force. For our setup, the slope would be 0.23 mm.kN−1 up to 3.5 kN.
With this “calibration”, we could evaluate the force on our setup by measuring

the deﬂection (”h” in Fig. 6) instead of the torque applied on the M6 screws.
This is far more reliable since, as detailed in Appendix, one cannot reliably
convert a torque into a force. This latter observation was conﬁrmed as we used
diﬀerent levels of cleaning for our M6 screws: similar applied torques would
not compress the washers equivalently. This is explained by the variation of
the SS-SS friction coeﬃcient as a function of lubrication.

After assembly, the overall setup is mounted in a LHe cryostat.

5 Samples preparation

We have used the following bulk materials which were not heat treated for our
tests:

– Al plate (9.7 mm×130 mm×370 mm) - purity 4N6 [39]. On a test sample,

we measured a RRR of ≈350 for the raw material.

– Standard CuC2 ((cid:119)OFHC) block. On a test sample, we measured a RRR

of ≈130 for the raw material.

2 Al (Al1, Al2) and 4 Cu (Cu1 to Cu4) samples were machined to the desired
shape. They were then hand-polished using sequentially abrasive papers P400,
P800, P2500, P4000, and ﬁnally 1 µm diamond paste. A veriﬁcation on a
proﬁlometer gives a roughness of ≈20 nm on the surface with some scratches
in the 100 – 500 nm range. There are more and deeper scratches for Al, for
which a homogeneous polishing is diﬃcult to achieve since particles are easily
detached from the bulk during polishing. After polishing, a ﬁrst “soft” cleaning
sequence has been applied: 3 minutes ultrasonic bath in RBS Neutral T – 6%
concentration [40] – in hot water for Al and 3 minutes ultrasonic bath in RBS
T 305 – 5% concentration [40] – in hot water for Cu, followed by 3 minutes
ultrasonic rinsing bath in a beaker of hot water and 3 minutes ultrasonic bath
in a beaker of ethanol, and ﬁnally drying with a soft cloth. The samples were
then stored for days or weeks.
Immediately before Au evaporation or insertion of In, the samples underwent
a stronger cleaning sequence:

– For Al and Cu: Remover (MicroChem 1112A [41]) ≈15 mins + Rinse with

de-ionized water.

– For Al and Cu: Acetone 10 mins in ultrasonic bath + isopropyl alcohol

2 mins ultrasonic bath.

– For Al only: a standard ”Aluminium Etch” process as follows: 75% H3PO4
+ 2-5% HNO3 + 20% de-ionized water ≈12 mins + rinse in de-ionized
water until resistance of water is >12 MΩ. Note that the etching rate
is expected to be around 20 nm/min resulting in the removal of up to
≈240 nm of Al22O3. After this step, the surface was slightly less mirror-
like and surface pitting was visible in some places.

Setup with gold plating – sample reference Al1 + Cu3 (AB side) + Cu4 (CD
side):

– About 40 minutes after cleaning, introduction of the 2 Cu pieces and Al

block into an electron beam evaporator (Plassys model MEB550).

– Argon plasma etch with the following parameters: I = 52 mA, V = 600 V,

3 minutes with the samples under rotation (5 rpm)2

– Electron beam evaporation of 200 nm of Au with the following parameters:
0.5 nm/s deposit (V = 9.85 kV, I = 308 mA, 5 rpm rotation, vacuum level
≈2 × 10−5 Pa).

2 Very rough estimates based on measured etching rates of 7.4 nm/min for SiO2 on Si

and on [34] suggest an etching rate of ≈1.5 nm/min for Al2O3.

– Immediately after removal from the evaporator, the two gold surfaces were
placed in contact. Compressive force was applied by alternately tightening
the bolts.

– Application of an eﬀort of 11 kN with a hydraulic press (performed 2 days

after sample assembly).

– Re-tighten bolts to obtain a compression force of about 3 kN per bolt (5

Nm measured torque).

Setup with indium – sample reference Al2 + Cu1 (AB side) + Cu2 (CD side):

– A 99.999% purity piece of indium [42] approximately 1 mm×1mm×15mm
was placed at the centre of the contact surface between the Al and Cu,
which were then pressed together. A small sphere of indium was squeezed
rather than a thin foil to limit the initial surface to volume ratio of the
indium and consequently the quantity of oxide present on its surface.
– Assembly of Al + Cu parts in the clamp and tightening of the bolts pro-
gressively to 8.5 Nm. The applied force was insuﬃcient to fully squash the
indium.

– Application of an eﬀort of 11 kN with a hydraulic press (performed 2 days

after sample assembly).

– Re-tighten bolts to obtain compression of the Belleville washers of ≈0.7 mm

(3 kN per bolt) – typical tightening torque 3.5 - 4.5 Nm

6 Results

Measurements are of 4 wire type. The two samples are mounted in series
as presented in Fig. 7. The voltage is measured accross each of the contact
resistances (V1, V3, V4 and V5). Actually, for each of these measurements,
there is a contribution from bulk Cu and Al. From their measured RRRs,
we evaluate their total contribution to be about 3 nΩ for each of the two
samples. Measurement V6 is used as a veriﬁcation of the overall setup since
the characteristics of the Al block are well known.

We used a program developed under LabViewTM to analyse the resistance
of our samples. Each measurement sequence is achieved in several steps with
current reversal between steps so as to compensate for thermo-electric eﬀects.
Each step lasts about 2 minutes and we programmed between 7 and 21 steps.
The current (Kikusui Model PBZ40-10 current source) is chosen between 1 and
10 A. Copper current leads of low resistance run inside the cryostat and the
current is injected into the samples at the level of the stainless steel support
central screw (see Fig. 5). We always tested several current values in order to
maximise the signal while checking for overheating eﬀects. For each current
step, voltages are measured sequentially using a Keithley model 2000 multi-
meter equipped with a multiplexer. For each channel, the voltage is averaged
over about 20 measurements during each current step. The corresponding re-
sistance is averaged over the current steps, ignoring the ﬁrst and second steps,
during which the system is stabilizing.

ﬁller (blue). Right: with Au deposit on Cu and Al (yellow).

We always made a ﬁrst set of measurements at 300 K so as to check all the
connections, verify the overall measurement chain, compare with the calculated
value for bulk Al and get ﬁrst results on the contact resistances. The samples
are then slowly cooled down to 4.2K during several hours using ﬁrst liquid
nitrogen and then liquid helium.

Results obtained with these 2 samples (⇔ 4 contacts) are summarized in
Table 2. Prior to the second measurement sequence at 4.2 K, the bolts A
& B on each sample (Cu1 & Cu3) were loosened by approximately 0.4 mm
corresponding to a ﬁnal force of ≈1.3 kN for each bolt. The measurements
were repeated 4 months later. Finally, the bolts A & B on each sample were
loosened to 0.2 mm compression of Belleville washers corresponding to a ﬁnal
force of ≈0.87 kN for each bolt. For this latest cool down, we also removed
Belleville washers on bolts C & D on each setup (Cu2 & Cu4) then tightened
back the bolts to 0.75 Nm, which corresponds to a force between 0.7 to 1 kN
(friction coeﬃcients between 0.18 and 0.12) for each bolt. We chose such low
forces and also to remove Belleville washers in order to mimic the most simple
cryogenic setup one can think of.

Whatever the type of junction, gold plated or with indium ﬁller, the re-
sistances at 4.2 K are close to or below 20 nΩ. The best results are obtained
with gold plating. For the 2 gold plated samples, resistances cannot be dis-
tinguished from the expected contribution of bulk materials. Furthermore, no
degradation with time is observed and there seems to be no dependence on
the applied force, at least down to our minimum ≈1.5 kN total force. The
11 kN force applied with the press may have ”frozen” the Al-Au-Cu interfaces
so that it is not necessary to maintain a strong force on the contact area.

The contact resistances are higher with indium. They do not seem to de-
pend much on the applied force either, but may degrade with time. This latter
eﬀect is diﬃcult to quantify due to measurement uncertainties.

7 Complementary results and discussion

In this section, we give complenetary information deduced from previous mea-
surements (with few details for clarity purpose):

– It has been suggested [24,35] that highly polished surfaces usually don’t
give the lowest resistances. But, on the other hand, evaporated gold is
expected to adhere better to a highly polished surface. We have tested
roughly polished gold plated samples (typ. 1 µm roughness for Al and Cu)
but in all cases the resistance was above 100 nΩ, even after addition of
indium as a ﬁller. We cannot conﬁrm that polishing in the 20-40 nm range
is an optimum but rough samples do not give very low resistances.

– For a sample undergoing a less agressive argon etching (≈2.5 times less
Al2O3 removed compared to previous sample) and experiencing a lower
force (≈6 kN via screwing instead 11 kN via hydraulic press), the contact
resistance was above 230 nΩ initially and degraded with time. We believe
this to be caused by residual Al2O3 which could then serve as starting
point for further oxidation. Application of 8 kN via hydraulic press on a
similar sample only reduced the resistance from 240 nΩ to 140 nΩ.

– We dismounted some of the samples for visual inspection. The force re-
quired to separate the polished and gold plated copper and aluminium
pieces was not negligible (but still by hand). All the gold over the contact
area had transferred to the copper block, leaving a bare aluminium surface.
Note that in the case of the roughly polished sample, the parts separated
spontaneously which suggests that a more intimate contact is obtained for
highly polished surfaces.

8 Conclusion

S´ebastien Triqueneaux et al.

We have demonstrated that very low Al/Cu contact resistances at low temper-
ature – in the order of a few nΩ – can be achieved with rather simple methods:
one with the use of an indium ﬁller (and no gold plating) and one with gold
plating in a standard evaporator for micro-electronics. The gold plating sam-
ples gave better results and seem to be more stable with time.
Furthermore, unlike indium, gold will not undergo any superconducting tran-
sition at low temperature, which might aﬀect the thermal conductance of the
joint.
The necessary elements for obtaining such low Al/Cu contact resistances seem
to be:

– A ﬁne polishing of the Al and Cu surfaces.
– The total removal of the Al2O3 oxide layers. These layers are partially
removed by chemical etching. For gold plated samples, complete removal is
achieved via an Ar etching followed by Au evaporation without air exposure
in between. For samples using indium, we believe that friction between the
aluminum and the indium when the latter is squashed between the smooth
surfaces is suﬃcient to break the oxide layer.

– The application of strong compression forces, but only temporarily.

We believe these contacts are not compatible with multiple disconnections.
It is obvious for samples using indium since, after dismounting, we saw that
the Al block was strongly imprinted. For the gold plated samples, the gold
will probably remain stuck to the copper piece, thus allowing the aluminium
surface to oxidize again.

It might be interesting to measure the thermal conductance of the Al/Cu
contacts at low temperatures. First, this would provide further information on
the applicability of the Wiedemann-Franz law for contacts at low temperature
since there are conﬂicting results in the literature. On one side a discrepancy up
to a factor of 2.5 has been reported [36] while discrepancies are much smaller
for Gloos et al. [16] – see Table 1. This would also allow testing the eﬀect of
the indium ﬁller far below its superconducting transition. For the purpose of
the construction of the CNDR, similar tests with (Cu-Au)-(Au-Cu) contacts
will be needed in order to keep the overall heat switch dismountable together
with a resistance below the required value of 150 nΩ.

(cid:63) Extracting a force from the applied torque seems not a trivial procedure. For example,
Deutsch [27] reports a torque of 4 Nm with a NC8-32 SS screw. The corresponding force
may vary by more than a factor of 4 depending on the actual input parameters. First,
there are various expressions for the calculation of the force and some might be erroneous.
As an example, if one assumes that the parameter D from equation (8) provided in [21] is
equivalent to the parameter 0.5×(ds + dh) from equation (A1) in [26], then the pre-factor
for this contribution diﬀers by a factor of 2. We believe [26] should preferably be
considered. But, mainly, there is a large dispersion in the friction coeﬃcients to be used in
these equations. In [21], a friction coeﬃcient of 0.12 is assumed while it is of 0.53 in [26].
From our understanding, the ﬁrst one is better adapted to SS-SS bolts while the second
one corresponds to a dry SS-Cu connection. In reference [55] of Dhuley’s article, we also
ﬁnd that the friction coeﬃcient for SS-304L to Cu would be of 0.23 in the worst case.
Taking equation (A1) from Dhuley together with his parameters for UNC 8-32 screws
(table 2 in [26]), and a torque of 4 Nm one can calculate forces of 1.4 kN, 3 kN and 5.4 kN
for µ = µb = 0.12, 0.23 and 0.53 respectively. We believe µ = 0.23 is more realistic and we
thus propose 3 kN equivalent force in the table.
