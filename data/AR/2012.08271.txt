AR SER: PHOTOMETRIC OBSERVATIONS OF A BLAZHKO STAR

We observed AR Serpentis (RA=15h33min30.8s DEC=+2◦46(cid:48)38(cid:48)(cid:48)(2000.0) average V
mag=12.0) between 2010 and 2014, with Johnson V ﬁlters and CCD cameras. 2195 pho-
tometry measurements over 58 nights were gathered in 2010-2014 with a 20 cm telescope
located in France (MB), and 4599 measurements over 74 nights in 2014 with a 40 cm
telescope in Chile (HMB).

For the diﬀerential photometry, the comparison star is UCAC4 464-053185 with a V
magnitude of 11.551. Because the instruments are diﬀerent, there is a magnitude oﬀset
between the two observers. Owing to 3 pairs of overlapping times-series with the two
setups (as shown in Figure 1), this oﬀset is evaluated to be 20 mmag, that is added to
the measurements obtained with the 20 cm telescope.

Figure 1. An example of a pair of overlapping times-series. Cross: data with the 20 cm telescope,
circle: with the 40 cm one.

The data are analyzed with the PERIOD04 software program (Lenz & Breger, 2005)
which provides simultaneously sine-wave ﬁtting and least-squares ﬁtting algorithms. This
yields the pulsation frequency:
Fp = 1.7385671 ± 3.9.10−6 day−1
(or the pulsation period: Pp = 0.5751863 day ± 0.12 s).

There is no evidence for a variation of this period during our observations. The

ephemeris for the maxima of the pulsation is then:
t(n) = 2, 456, 135.181 + nPp HJD

Owing to the PERIOD04 software program, the data are ﬁtted with a sine-wave func-

tion of time t, with the number of harmonics of up to the 7th order:
f (t) = z + Σ8
with z = 11.9597 ± 0.0014 mag and the other parameters given in Table 1, components
F1-F8.

i=1Ai sin[2π(Fit + Φi)]

The resulting phase plot is shown in Figure 2 and the residuals of the observations

from the f(t) function in Figure 3.

f(t) function. The phase origin is arbitrary.

Figure 3. The diﬀerence between the observa-
tions and the f(t) function.

The deviations around the ﬁt f(t) are due to the Blazhko eﬀect.
The Blazhko modulation is expected to show up as side peaks around multiples of the
pulsation frequency Fp in the Fourier spectrum (Breger & Kolenberg, 2006 and Szeidl &
Jurcsik, 2009). The two strongest signals in the residuals of the pulsation (prewhitening)
correspond to the frequencies FB1 = 1/89 day−1 and FB2 = 1/109 day−1. Peaks are
clearly seen at nFp ± FB1 and nFp ± FB2 with n=1, 2, 3, as shown in Figures 4, 5, 6.
Hence, AR Ser has two Blazhko modulations.

There are many fainter peaks in the spectra and we refrain to interpret them. However
there is a possibility for signals at nFp ± 2FB2 (see Figures 4, 5, 6), although ﬁtting the
data including them does not much improve the residuals. Such quintuplets may imply
a magnetic origin for the modulation (Shibahashi, 2000) or may be due to a non-radial
pulsation (Dziembowki & Mizerski, 2004). The ﬁrst star where a Blazhko eﬀect was
discovered with quintuplets was RV UMa (Hurta et al., 2008) and a number of them have
been found since, especially owing to satellite observations (Chadid et al., 2010).

The observations are not evenly distributed, with most of them concentrated over a
time interval of about 1/FB1 (the data obtained from Chile). We checked that the signals
at FB1 are not spurious by computing the Fourier spectrum of the data obtained from
France only, that span 5 years: the strongest signals are still at FB1.

Using the PERIOD04 software program, the observations are then ﬁtted with the
frequencies nFp ± FB1 and nFp ± FB2. The results are shown in Table 1, components F9
through F20.

The data from Chile have a very dense coverage. Their Fourier spectrum was then

searched for a high frequency Blazhko modulation, with a negative result.

The residuals of the observations and of this modeling (the F(t) function, see below)
were searched for signals at FB1 and FB2, in the low frequency end of their Fourier

IBVS 5xxx

spectrum, with negative results. The spectrum was also searched for half-integer multiples
of the pulsation frequency Fp (this is connected to the period doubling, see Szab´o, 2014),
with negative results.

The ﬁt function F(t) is:

F (t) = Z + Σ20
i=1Ai sin[2π(Fit + Φi)]
with Z = 11.95590 ± 0.00057 mag.

Figure 4. The Fourier spectra of the residuals around Fp. The upper solid line is after prewhitening
with the Fp pulsation. The triplet at FB1 is noted 89+ and 89-, the one at FB2, 109+ and 109- (there is
a hint for a quintuplet with FB2, hence the 109++ and 109- -). The middle dotted line is after
prewhitening with both the Fp pulsation and the FB1 modulation: the triplets at FB2 are clearly
visible. The bottom solid line is after prewhitening with the pulsation and the modulations at FB1 and
FB2: only noise is left.

The diﬀerence between the F(t) and the f(t) represents the Blazhko modulations. It is

shown in Figure 7.

The two Blazhko periods may be computed from the F9, F10, F13, F14, F17 and F18
components of Table 1 for the ﬁrst period, and from the other components starting from
F11 for the second period. The average and standard deviations are:
1/FB1 = 89.1 ± 1.3 days
1/FB2 = 109.6 ± 2.6 days.

AR Ser was reported in the literature having one Blazhko modulation close to FB2
(Firmanyuk, 1977, Kolenberg et al., 2008) and also an uncertainty pulsation of 63 days
(Wils et al., 2006), not seen in our data. We observe it with two modulations of comparable
amplitude. The ﬁrst Blazhko star discovered as having two modulations of comparable
amplitude is CZ Lac (S´odor et al., 2011). Such stars are not very common in ground-based
observations (Skarko, 2014) although they seem to be ubiquitous in satellite observations
(Benk˝o et al., 2014).

The ratio of the two frequencies may be expressed as the ratio of two small integers,
FB1/FB2 = 6/5, a common occurrence for Blazhko stars with two modulations (Skarka,
2014, Benk˝o et al., 2014, S´odor et al., 2011).

The residuals of the observations and of the F(t) function are shown in Figure 8.
Although they are much improved compared to Figure 3, there are a few time-series
that do not ﬁt the model F(t) and are out of phase or with too large amplitudes. Such
discrepant observations appear suddenly, that means the time series obtained a few weeks
or days before or after ﬁt the model. This suggests irregularities or glitches, which is a
behavior observed in many Blazhko stars (Szab´o, 2014).
