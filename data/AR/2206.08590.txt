and Astronomy,

Neutrinos with energy of order 10 MeV, such as from pion decay-at-rest sources, are an invalu-
able tool for studying low-energy neutrino interactions with nuclei – previously enabling the ﬁrst
measurement of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. Beyond elastic scattering, neutrinos
and dark matter in this energy range also excite nuclei to its low-lying nuclear states, providing an
additional physics channel. Here, we consider neutral-current inelastic neutrino-nucleus and dark
matter(DM)-nucleus scattering oﬀ 40Ar, 133Cs, and 127I nuclei that are relevant to a number of low-
threshold neutrino experiments at pion decay-at-rest facilities. We carry out large scale nuclear shell
model calculations of the inelastic cross sections considering the full set of electroweak multipole op-
erators. Our results demonstrate that Gamow-Teller transitions provide the dominant contribution
to the cross section and that the long-wavelength limit provides a reasonable approximation to the
total cross section for neutrino sources. We show that future experiments will be sensitive to this
channel and thus these results provide additional neutrino and DM scattering channels to explore
at pion decay-at-rest facilities.

INTRODUCTION

The large ﬂux of neutrinos produced as a by-product
at spallation neutron sources has enabled new tests of
the Standard Model of particle physics. Most notably,
the ﬁrst measurement of coherent elastic neutrino nucleus
scattering (CEνNS) by the COHERENT collaboration at
the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in 2017 [1]. Several
other CEνNS experiments have been completed or are in
operation, such as Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) at
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) [2]. Additional
measurements have improved in precision and thus far
they are in agreement with the Standard Model (SM)
predictions [3]. Further improvements in precision will
allow these experiments to probe physics beyond the SM,
e.g. non-standard neutrino interactions [4–16] and dark
matter [17–24].

tering, where the nucleus is left in an excited state.
Neutrinos with energies of tens of MeV can excite
many states in the various target nuclei used for these
experiments. While the cross section for inelastic
scattering is much smaller than the coherently enhanced
elastic scattering, these processes could provide unique
tests of new physics and/or important backgrounds
to new physics searches. Additionally, understanding

inelastic neutrino-nucleus scattering is also vital for the
detection of core-collapse supernova signals by the next
generation neutrino experiments, such as DUNE [25]
and Hyper-K [26]. At present there are very few existing
measurements of inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections
in this energy regime, leaving them poorly understood.
The measurements that exist are primarily for carbon
and iron targets performed by the KARMEN [27] and
LSND [28] collaborations, none at better than the 10%
uncertainty level. Presently no measurement has been
made for scattering on the argon nucleus. Theoretical
understanding of these processes is also relatively poor,
due to strong dependence of the interaction rates on
the speciﬁc initial- and ﬁnal-state nuclear wavefunctions
and require cumbersome computation to account for
underlying complex nuclear structure. It is therefore im-
portant to have good theoretical estimates of their rates
employing fast and eﬃcient computational methods.

A number of theoretical approaches have been used
in the past to calculate inelastic neutrino-nucleus scat-
tering [29–34] although with more attention paid to the
charged current processes. Additionally, not much at-
tention has been paid to nuclei that are relevant to the
current low-energy neutrino experiments, e.g., argon and
cesium. More recent studies of neutral current inelastic
processes have been presented, e.g., within the continuum
Random Phase Approximation (CRPA) method [35, 36],
the deformed shell model mixed with the free nucleon
approximation [37], and merely free nucleon approxima-
tion [38]. The CRPA model employs long-range corre-
lations among nucleons on top of a Hartree-Fock pic-
ture of the nucleus and predicts cross sections above the

nucleon emission threshold utilizing a multipole expan-
sion [39, 40]. This method to date provides predictions
of inclusive cross sections, not cross sections for speciﬁc
ﬁnal states which are required for predicting detailed ex-
perimental signatures. The free nucleon approximation
is particularly inaccurate in the calculation of inelastic
scattering in this energy range since it ignores nuclear
structure. While Ref. [37] does employ the deformed
shell model to include nuclear structure eﬀects, their re-
sults only consider the ﬁrst excited state. In this work
we provide the ﬁrst comprehensive calculation of neutral
current (NC) inelastic neutrino-nucleus scattering using
electroweak theory and the nuclear shell model, and ex-
tend it to describe inelastic DM-nucleus scattering in a
consistent manner.

Low-energy beam based neutrino experiments (CCM,
COHERENT, etc.) provide a great opportunity to probe
well-motivated light dark matter via light mediators,
where the timing information is utilized to control the
SM neutrino background. The high-intensity proton
beam impacts a target producing a high-intensity ﬂux
of photons from cascades, meson decays and pion ab-
sorption [41]. These photons can then produce light
vector mediators via kinetic mixing, while scalar media-
tors can be produced from three-body decays of charged
pions [42]. The light mediators decay promptly into a
pair of DM particles which can then produce signals via
nuclear recoils in the detector. For proton beams with
Ep ∼ 1 GeV the resulting energy of light DM particles
is ∼ O(50-100) MeV. Like the neutrinos, the DM par-
ticles will also initiate inelastic DM-nucleus scattering.
Here, the inelastic scatters involve relativistic DM unlike
the non-relativistic DM-nucleus scattering in direct de-
tection experiments, previously explored in [43]. In this
paper we evaluate these cross sections fully relativisti-
cally using electroweak multipole operators, with special
attention to the long-wavelength limit Gamow Teller op-
erator.

The DM-nucleus inelastic scattering process is medi-
ated by a neutral dark photon only and thus the NC
neutrino-nucleus scattering process will be an important
and irreducible background for any accelerator based DM
searches using this channel.

The paper is organized as follows, in section II we de-
scribe neutrino-nucleus scattering within the electroweak
multipole framework, in section III we extend this to the
case of DM-nucleus scattering, in section IV we present
the shell-model calculation results for the cross sections,
in section V, we discuss scattering rates and experimental
signatures and lastly, in section VI we conclude.

II. NEUTRINO-NUCLEUS SCATTERING

At suﬃciently small momentum transfer (where q <
100 MeV), neutrinos coherently scatter from nuclei
which, in the case of elastic scattering, greatly enhances
the cross section. As shown in Fig. 1, the scattering pro-

2

cess involves the exchange of a Z boson, where the out-
going nucleus N ∗ could be in the ground state (for elastic
scattering) or an excited state (for inelastic scattering).
Inelastic scattering can also proceed via a charged cur-
rent interaction, in which case the outgoing nucleus will
have a diﬀerent atomic number. In this work we will only
consider neutral current scattering.

scattering process where a Z 0 boson is exchanged

where mN is the target nucleus mass, Eν is the incom-
ing neutrino energy, Er is the nuclear recoil energy, Z
(N ) is the target’s atomic (neutron) number, FW (q2)
is the weak form factor of the nucleus, and θW is the
Weinberg angle. A common parameterization for the
form factor is the Helm form [44]. Given the value of
sin2 θW ≈ 0.23, the CEνNS cross section scales approxi-
mately as the number of neutrons squared in the target
nucleus, and (not including small radiative corrections) is
independent of the neutrino ﬂavor. Eﬀorts to improve the
CEνNS cross section calculation through a more detailed
treatment of the hadronic current which allows for sub-
leading nuclear structure eﬀects was included in Ref. [45]
while radiative corrections were added in Ref. [46].

In the context of low-energy CEνNS experiments, the
inelastic scattering of neutrinos has not received much
attention - potentially owing to its smaller cross section
which is not coherently enhanced. Previous attempts to
estimate the inelastic neutrino-nucleus scattering rates
have not used detailed nuclear calculations [38] or only
explored the lowest lying states [37].
In this work we
apply the formalism of semi-leptonic electroweak theory
as developed in [47–49] to the calculation of inelastic
neutrino-nucleus scattering. In this formalism the rele-
vant hadronic current is spherically decomposed and ex-
panded in multipoles to obtain irreducible tensor opera-
tors which act on single particle states, which can generi-
cally be expressed as an expansion of harmonic oscillator

states [49]. This is a convenient basis to work in, since it
results in single-particle matrix elements that are polyno-

mials of the momentum transfer. Following [50], in the
extreme relativistic limit the total cross section can be
written as:

A. Gamow–Teller transitions

For small momentum transfers, when a Gamow-Teller
(GT) transition is kinematically accessible, the inelastic
cross section will be dominated by such allowed GT tran-
sitions. Considering the GT operator alone in the long
wavelength limit can then provide an eﬃcient way to ap-
proximate the scattering cross section. In the multipole
operator analysis the GT operator is contained within

where we have written the ﬁnal neutrino energy in terms

this approximation. We can then make connection with
the common form of the cross section for neutral current

This form of the cross section is in agreement with oth-

section that using Eq. (9) to calculate the cross section
will allow for an important simpliﬁcation of the numeri-
cal many-body problem while providing an adequate es-
timation of the transition matrix elements in the long
wavelength limit.

N , mediated via a dark photon, A(cid:48).

III. DARK MATTER-NUCLEUS SCATTERING

In this section we apply the formalism discussed in the
preceding section to the inelastic scattering of dark mat-
ter (DM) on nuclei. Previous analyses considered the
scattering of nonrelativistic dark matter [37, 43], which
greatly restricts the excited states that are accessible.
Astrophysically, dark matter can be boosted via several
mechanisms, however the ﬂux will be subdominant com-
pared to the non-relativistic component. Larger ﬂuxes of
boosted dark matter could be produced in the decay of
particles produced in collider experiments such as [1, 2].
Low-energy beam dump experiments can investigate
light dark matter where the light dark matter interacts
with the SM particle via light mediators. In these exper-
iments neutrinos are produced as a product of stopped-
pion decay, but they are also high-intensity sources of
photons emerging from meson decays and cascades which
could produce exotic light vector mediators via kinetic
mixing. The light vector mediators can then promptly
decay into a pair of dark matter particles (χ, ¯χ) which
are semirelativistic. There exist many well motivated
models where this scenario is possible [18, 56–64]. As a
benchmark example we will consider a dark photon A-
prime (A(cid:48)) model where the A(cid:48) undergoes kinetic mixing
with the SM photon. The model is described by the La-
grangian:

L ⊃ gDA(cid:48)

µ ¯χγµχ + e(cid:15)QqA(cid:48)

µ ¯qγµq

(10)

where gD is the dark coupling constant, (cid:15) is the mixing
parameter, Qq is quark’s electric charge. The dark pho-
ton will be produced in the processes of pion capture,
pion decay and the photons emerging from the cascades:

π− + p → n + A(cid:48)
π+ + n → p + A(cid:48)
π0 → γ + A(cid:48)

(11)
(12)
(13)

Via these processes the SNS, for example, produces dark
photons at a rate of (cid:15)2 × 0.23 × 1020 per day, mostly from
π0 decay. The dark photons then decay to DM: A(cid:48) → χ ¯χ.
Previous analyses looked at the elastic scattering of such
DM from nuclei in the COHERENT detectors [41], here
we extend upon this to include inelastic scattering.

The scattering of DM from nuclei proceeds via the ex-
change of a dark photon, as depicted in Fig. 2. The cross
section of elastic DM-nucleus scattering is given by [65]:

scattering, the elastic cross section receives a coherent en-
hancement, in this case by a factor of Z 2 because the dark
photon couples to the electromagnetic current. There-
fore the ratio of elastic to inelastic events will be larger
in light nuclei (e.g. Ar) and smaller in heavy nuclei (e.g.
Cs and I). This is the reverse of the neutrino case (which
dominantly couple to neutrons); a feature that could aid
in diﬀerentiating a dark matter signal from the neutrino
background.

Similar to neutrino scattering, we can write down the
diﬀerential cross section for inelastic DM scattering via

the GT operator alone:

In principle one can integrate Eq. 14, Eq. 15, and Eq. 17
over Er to get the total cross section, however, in this
case closed form expressions could not be obtained.

and 127I nuclei since these nuclear targets are utilized
at the ongoing COHERENT and CCM experiments.
Two approaches to the calculation are taken: the full
multipole operator analysis and the GT transition in the
long wavelength limit. For both approaches we use the
nuclear shell model code BIGSTICK [66, 67] to solve
the many-body problem. To evaluate the cross sections
using the multipole analysis the full nuclear one-body
density matrix is
required, which BIGSTICK can
generate for converged eigenstates; then the multipole
operator matrix elements can be computed with the
aid of the Mathematica package SevenOperators [51].
Because this approach requires converged eigenstates,
it is time and memory consuming if one is interested
in many ﬁnal states. For the restricted case of the GT
transition one can use the simpler and more eﬃcient
“Lanczos trick” [68–70], which is directly incorporated
into BIGSTICK and does not require full convergence
of the Lanczos algorithm. While computing the full
density matrix will give more accurate results (including
contributions for all operators), we ﬁnd that the GT
strength is suﬃciently precise for our purposes. Impor-

tantly, when dealing with a large number of ﬁnal states,
it makes the calculation a tractable computational task.
When computing density matrices we are able to cal-
culate the transition from the ground state to the, for
example, N = 2 - 16 excited states of 40Ar. In compar-
ison, when computing the GT transition we are able to
calculate the strengths up to the N = 500 excited state
(including the states with zero strength).

For 133Cs and 127I, the nucleons are in the orbits 0g7/2,
1d5/2, 0h11/2, 1d3/2, 2s1/2 and we use jj55pna interaction
[71]. 40Ar has a more challenging nucleon conﬁguration;
the protons (10) are in sd orbits (0d5/2, 1s1/2, 0d3/2),
while the neutrons (14) are in pf orbits (0f7/2, 1p3/2,
0f5/2, 1p1/2). In that case we consider the nucleons are
in sdpf orbits, then perform a truncation to reduce the
computational workload. For this model space we apply
the SDPF-NR interaction [72–74].

A. Neutrino-nucleus cross sections

In Fig. 3, we compare the inelastic cross section re-
sult of our two calculations, multipole and GT, with the
CEνNS cross section and with two other inelastic results
from the literature. While diﬀerent calculations show
some agreement at lower energies but diverge at higher
energy. Our calculation of the total inelastic cross section
(given as the sum over all GT transitions) is around an
order of magnitude lower than that of Refs. [38] and more
closely follows that of [36] until around Eν = 40 MeV.
The former used the free nucleon approximation to cal-
culate just one excited state and so agreement is only ex-
pected for very small neutrino energies when few states
are kinematically accessible. The latter calculates the
inclusive inelastic cross section, above nucleon emission
threshold, for low-lying states through the Continuum
Random Phase Approximation (CRPA). Working with a
limited spectrum of excited states, our multipole results
can only include transitions to the ﬁrst 15 excited states
and thus it is unable to capture all accessible transitions
and therefore is not an accurate estimate of the total
cross section above Eν (cid:38) 10 MeV. However, we can use
it to assess the contribution of non-GT transitions since
the limited spectrum contains one J = 1 state (N = 9)
that is accessible via a GT transition. For comparison
we have plotted the GT cross section (Eq. 9) for the low-
est lying J = 1 state (gray curve in Fig. 3 top). This
conﬁrms that the GT transitions provide the dominant
contribution to the inelastic cross section. Additionally
we show the diﬀerential cross section as a function of
angle and the recoil energy in appendix B.

Additional terms in the multipole expansion do con-
tribute and are required for a precise calculation of the
cross section for any speciﬁc transition. However, when
estimating the total cross section, based on the limita-
tions of our calculation, it is much more accurate to en-
sure that all accessible GT transitions are included. For
the same number of states, the GT analysis generally

sections as a function of the incoming neutrino energy.
For comparison our calculations (Multipole, Total GT
and 1st GT) are compared with the CRPA [36] and free
nucleon [38] predictions. Bottom: total elastic and NC

consumes much less computational resources than the
multipole analysis. For this reason and the aforemen-
tioned improvement in accuracy we use the GT analysis
for our results in the following sections.

The total elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the
133Cs and 127I targets are shown in Fig. 3, where we
have included GT transitions to 300 and 100 states (in-
cluding the states with zero strength) for 133Cs and 127I,
respectively. The elastic cross sections of both nuclei are
virtually the same as they have a similar number of neu-
trons. In contrast, 127I has slight higher inelastic cross

section since it has a higher total GT strength than 133Cs,
as shown in Fig. 4.

Experimentally the signature of an inelastic collision
will be dominated by the deexcitation energy of the nu-
cleus. The excited nucleus falls back to the ground state
very quickly through the emission of photons and (if en-
ergetically allowed) neutrons. Previous studies focused
on the nuclear recoil energy, which is small in compar-
ison, but could in principle be measured (recoil spectra
are provided in appendix B). While a full calculation of
the observational signatures is beyond the scope of this
work, we can use the cross section to each excited state to
visualize the relative strength of the energy depositions
for each of the allowed transitions. In Fig. 4 we plot the
cross section for each transition vs. the excitation energy
for 40Ar, 133Cs and 127I for a incoming neutrino energy
of 30 MeV.

B. DM-nucleus cross sections

Following the method of the previous section we com-
puted the total cross section for dark matter inelastic
scattering using the GT operator in the long wavelength
limit. However, unlike the neutrino case, GT operator
does not provide a dominant contribution to the cross
section. We ﬁnd that GT transitions contribute roughly
50% of the total cross section, which is a reasonable ap-
proximation but not as accurate as for neutrino scatter-
ing. This is due to the diﬀerent Lorentz structure as-
sumed for the DM interactions (here taken to be vector)
which allows other operators to contribute more signiﬁ-
cantly. Therefore, the results presented here constitute
a lower bound on the inelastic DM-nucleus cross section.
Such an estimation, while inaccurate, are still useful for
assessing the minimum sensitivity of experiments and
for drawing exclusion limits. Increased accuracy can be
obtained via the full multipole analysis (and signiﬁcant
computational resources) if required.

√

In Fig. 5, we show the elastic and inelastic cross sec-
tion for dark matter scattering on the target nuclei 40Ar,
133Cs and 127I assuming mχ = 30MeV, mA(cid:48) = 90 MeV,
(cid:15) = 10−4 and gD =
2π (this parameter space is allowed
by the current experimental data [21]). Since the dark
matter is not massless, Eχ has a threshold of 30 MeV, as
shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 5. The cross section σ is propor-
tional to the couplings constant (cid:15)2, so one can scale this
plot by changing (cid:15). As expected we ﬁnd that 133Cs and
127I have a higher elastic cross section than 40Ar since σel
has explicit Z 2 (atomic number) dependence, but have a
lower inelastic cross section because σinel is determined
by the GT strength, as shown in Fig. 4. The GT transi-
tion cross section is the largest for 40Ar and is the lowest
for 133Cs. There is a plateau for χ−40Ar in Fig. 5, but
not in 133Cs or 127I. This is because there are fewer low
lying states in 40Ar than 133Cs or 127I. We also observe
a small plateau in ν−40Ar in Fig. 3, but this is not as
noticeable as with DM scattering since the neutrino is
massless. We also calculate the recoil energy spectrum
for dark matter scattering in appendix B.

V. SCATTERING RATES AND
EXPERIMENTAL SIGNATURES

Using the results of the previous section we compute
the rates for neutrino and DM scattering oﬀ 40Ar, 133Cs,
and 127I nuclei. For a source of neutrinos or DM with
ﬂux Φ [cm−2 s−1], the number of events expected, N , is

consider pion decay at rest sources, and for DM we simu-
late the energy spectra in both COHERENT and CCM.
For the dark matter spectrum we need to determine the
production rates of relevant mesons. We use the results
from Ref. [41] which uses GEANT4 to determine these
production rates at CCM and COHERENT. In addition
to π0 decays and π− absorption, e± induced cascades
photons are important to produce dark photons for the
DM production. We show the DM energy spectrum for
CCM (which uses an 800 MeV proton beam), along with
the neutrino energy spectra at COHERENT (which uses
a 1 GeV proton beam) in Fig. 6 with mχ = 30 MeV.

Table I summarizes the key speciﬁcations of the exper-
iments we consider, we additionally assume a detection
eﬃciency of 100% and that all energy depositions are
above threshold. As an example we take the DM mass
to be mχ = 30 MeV, dark photon mass mA(cid:48) = 90 MeV
with coupling constants (cid:15) = 10−4 and gD =
2π. We
assume that CCM will operate continuously for 3 years
with 3 × 1022 POT, while COHERENT has already ran
for ∼ 1.61 years with their CsI detector (mT = 14.6
kg) with 3.20 × 1023 POT and approximately 0.6 years
with their LAr detector (mT = 24.4 kg) with 1.34 × 1023
POT. Table II shows the estimated number of events for

√

the two experiments under these assumptions. The DM
energy spectrum has a broader energy range extending
up to hundreds of MeV, much higher than the neutrino
spectrum. The high energy tail causes DM to induce
a higher rate of inelastic events compared to neutrinos.
Therefore, the elastic to inelastic event ratios for DM are
lower in all detectors.

We have applied the nuclear shell model to calculate
cross sections of neutrino-nucleus and DM-nucleus scat-
tering. The DM particles are produced from the light
vector mediator and this mediator is produced from the
kinetic mixing with photons in the stopped-pion experi-
ments (with ∼ 1 GeV proton beam) we are considering.
The number of states we calculated is large enough to in-
clude all non-trivial contributions such that the outcome
is reliable. In particular we focus on argon, caesium, and
iodine nuclei. We computed the cross section in two for-
malisms: a multipole analysis and the Gamow–Teller op-
erator alone in the long-wavelength limit. We found that
Gamow–Teller transitions dominate all other transitions
for neutrino scattering and account for around 50% of
the DM scattering. Using the Gamow-Teller operator,
our calculations show that the inelastic cross section is a
few orders of magnitude smaller than the elastic cross sec-
tion for both neutrino and dark matter scattering. We
also computed rates for two experimental setups based
on the computed cross section. The inelastic scattering
rate is much smaller than the elastic rate, but it will pro-
duce a much larger energy deposition that is potentially
easier to observe. In the setup we consider, since dark
matter spectrum has a higher energy tail than neutri-
nos, the inelastic contribution is higher and the ratio of
the inelastic to the elastic rate can be as large as 0.1 for
argon targets. The inelastic neutrino and DM scatter-
ing results presented here can be measured in currently
running stopped-pion experiments, such as at CCM and
COHERENT, and provide additional channels to explore
beyond the elastic scattering channel for which they were
initially conceived.

Appendix B: Shell model results

For a more detailed comparison in Fig. 7 we show the
diﬀerential cross section as a function of cos θ for the
multipole analysis (including the ﬁrst 15 transitions) and
the GT analysis involving the ﬁrst transition for a given
incoming neutrino energy Eν = 30 MeV. Again we see
that the N = 9 transition, the lowest lying GT transition,
dominates the inelastic cross section.

Fig. 8 shows Gamow-Teller cross section in recoil en-
ergy Er. Like we compare GT with multipole transition
in ν − N scattering (Fig. 3), we also show Fig. 9 for the
DM case. We cannot say GT dominates in χ − N scat-
tering, but it is still a good enough approximation (at
most a factor of 2) to estimate the total cross section
with reasonable computational time. Fig. 10 shows mul-
tipole and GT ratios of χ−40Ar scattering cross section.
