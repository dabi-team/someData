AUSLANDER-REITEN SEQUENCES FOR GORENSTEIN RINGS OF DIMENSION ONE

ROBERT ROY

ABSTRACT. Let R be a complete local Gorenstein ring of dimension one, with maximal ideal m. We
show that if M is a Cohen-Macaulay R-module which begins an AR-sequence, then this sequence is
produced by a particular endomorphism of m corresponding to a minimal prime ideal of R. We apply
this result to determining the shape of some components of stable Auslander-Reiten quivers, which in
the considered examples are shown to be tubes.

1. INTRODUCTION

The theory of Auslander-Reiten (AR) quivers is central in the study of artin algebras. Re-
garding AR theory for maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over a complete Cohen-Macaulay
local ring, the cases of ﬁnite AR quivers have been studied thoroughly (see [17]), but in the
more common case of inﬁnite type, shapes of AR quivers seem to be largely unknown.

The paper [1] agrees with this assessment (cf. its introduction), and begins to bridge this
gap. It establishes a variety of lemmas in the context of symmetric orders over a DVR, O,
and applies these lemmas to proving the shape (namely, a tube) of some components of the
AR quiver of a truncated polynomial ring O[X ]/(X n). The work of the latter calculation
consisted largely in proving that a module is indecomposable, but also in proving that a
sequence is an AR sequence. Our main result, Theorem 4.8, makes the latter task much
easier, in the setting of a complete local Gorenstein ring R of dimension one, with maximal
ideal m. Namely it shows that there exists a set of elements of EndR m, corresponding to
the minimal primes of R, which produce the AR sequences in a concrete way. We apply
the theorem in Section 6, where we establish the shapes of AR components (again, tubes)
over a graded hypersurface of the form k[x, y]/((bxp + yq) f ) where f ∈ k[x, y] is an arbitrary
homogeneous polynomial.

Regarding the structure of this paper, Sections 2 and 3, as well as the Appendix, consist
of supporting material for the proof of our main result in Section 4. In Section 5 we give
background concerning the abstract notion of stable translation quivers, and in Section 6
we record lemmas concerning the AR quiver of R. Speciﬁcally, Proposition 6.23 establishes
a criterion, based on material in [1], for proving that an AR component is a tube. In Section
7 we apply this proposition and our main result, to an example.

We would like to thank the developers of Singular [7]; we used it to compute many exam-

ples testing Theorem 4.8 and Proposition 8.7 before proving them.

2. PRELIMINARIES

Notation 2.1. Throughout this paper, all rings are assumed noetherian. A ring which is
described with any subset of the words {reduced, Cohen-Macaulay, Gorenstein, regular} is
implicitly commutative. By a graded ring we will mean a Z-graded ring, that is, a ring
i∈Z A i satisfying A i A j ⊆ A i+ j. If A has not been referred to as a graded ring, J (A)
A =
will denote the Jacobson radical of A, whereas if A is explicitly graded, J (A) will denote
1

L

 
 
 
 
 
 
the intersection of all maximal graded left ideals of A (in our situations this will always
coincide with the intersection of all maximal graded right ideals). Similarly, but when A
is commutative, if A is not given a grading then Q(A) = A[nonzerodivisors]−1 (the total
quotient ring of A), whereas if A is graded then Q(A) = A[homogeneous nonzerodivisors]−1.
A (graded) ring A is said to be (graded-) local if A/J (A) is a division ring. By a connected
graded ring we shall mean a commutative N-graded ring R =
i≥0 R i such that R0 is a
ﬁeld. In this case ˆR will denote the m-adic completion of R, where m =
i≥1 R i. If R is any
commutative ring, min R will denote its set of minimal primes. If R is furthermore local or
graded-local, we usually write mR instead of J (R).

L

L

We will say that an R-module M has rank (speciﬁcally, rank n), if M ⊗R Q(R) is a free
Q(R)-module (of rank n). If R is reduced, then R will denote the integral closure of R in
Q(R).

2.1. Trace lemmas. We establish some preliminary lemmas regarding trace. Observations
of this general type have certainly been made before; see [2, proposition 5.4]. First, we deﬁne
the trace of an endomorphism of an arbitrary ﬁnitely generated projective module, as in [10].

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let A be a commutative ring, and let P be a ﬁnitely generated projective
A-module. Then the map µP : HomA(P, A)⊗A P −→ EndA P given by f ⊗x 7→ (y 7→ f (y)x) is an
isomorphism, by Lemma 2.14. Let ǫ : HomA(P, A)⊗A P −→ A denote the map given by f ⊗x 7→
f (x). For h ∈ EndA P, we deﬁne trace(h) = ǫ(µ−1
P (h)). If e1, . . ., en and ϕ1, . . ., ϕn ∈ HomA(P, A)

are such that µP (
this, and using that P =
trace(h g) for all g, h ∈ EndA P.

n
i=1 φi ⊗ e i) = idP , then trace(h) furthermore equals

i Ae i, it follows that trace is symmetric, in the sense that trace(gh) =

P

P

P

Remark 2.3. We can see that the above deﬁnition of trace specializes to the usual one when
P is free, by taking the aforementioned {e i, φi}i to be a free basis and the corresponding
projection maps. If A = k1 × . . . × ks is a product of ﬁelds k i, then by a similar argument we
see that for any h ∈ EndA P, we have trace(h) = (trace(h ⊗A k1), . . ., trace(h ⊗A ks)).

Let R be a commutative ring and set Q = Q(R). Recall that if R is an ungraded reduced
ring, then Q is the product of ﬁelds Rp = Q(R/p) where p ranges over min R. In particular,
each Rp is an ideal of Q, and a Q-algebra.

Lemma 2.4. Let R be a reduced ring (possibly graded), let M be a ﬁnitely generated R-
module such that M ⊗R Q is Q-projective, and let h ∈ EndR M. Then trace(h ⊗R Q) ∈ R. (In
the ungraded case, the condition that M ⊗R Q is Q-projective is automatically satisﬁed, since
Q is semisimple.)
Proof. First suppose the graded case. Let Q′ = R[nonzerodivisors]−1; thus Q′ is a localization
of Q is a localization of R, and R ⊆ Q ⊆ Q′. As M ⊗R Q is Q-projective, there exists a ﬁnite
set {e i ∈ M ⊗R Q}i and corresponding {ϕi : M ⊗R Q −→ Q}i such that y =
i φi(y)e i for all
i(φi ⊗Q Q′)(y)e i
y ∈ M⊗R Q. Then the images of the e i in M⊗R Q′ have the property that y =
i(φi ⊗Q Q′)((h⊗R Q′)(e i)) =
for all y ∈ M⊗R Q′. Therefore trace(h⊗R Q) =
trace(h ⊗R Q′). Since R is equal to the integral closure of R in Q′ by [11, Corollary 2.3.6], we
P
are thus reduced to the ungraded case.

i φi((h⊗R Q)(e i)) =

P
P

P

Since R =

p∈min R R/p, we see by Remark 2.3 that it sufﬁces to show trace(h ⊗R Rp) ∈ R/p,
for each p ∈ min R. As h ⊗R Rp = (h ⊗R R/p) ⊗R/p Rp, we may assume R is a domain. By [15,
Theorem 2.1], h satisﬁes a monic polynomial with coefﬁcients in R, say f (X ) ∈ R[X ]. Let
2

Q

H = h ⊗R Q, and let µ(X ) ∈ Q[X ] be the minimal polynomial of H. Let χ(X ) ∈ Q[X ] be the
characteristic polynomial of H, and take a ﬁeld extension L ⊇ Q over which χ(X ) splits, say
χ(X ) = (X − α1)(X − α2) · · · (X − αs), αi ∈ L. Each αi is also a root of µ(X ), and therefore of
f (X ). Therefore R[α1, ..., αs] is an integral extension of R. Thus R ⊇ Q ∩ R[α1, ..., αs], which
contains the coefﬁcients of χ(X ). Finally, recall that trace(H) is the degree-(s − 1) coefﬁcient
(cid:3)
of χ.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.5. In the situation of Lemma 2.4, assume that dim R = 1 and that R is either a
complete local ring or a connected graded ring. If some power of h lies in mR EndR M, then
trace(h ⊗R Q) ∈ J (R).

Q

Proof. As J (R) =
p∈min R J (R/p), we may again assume R is a domain. In the connected
graded case, we have J ( ˆR) ∩ R = J (R) by Lemma 9.4, and we can therefore assume the
complete local case. We can also assume M ⊆ M ⊗R Q, i.e., replace M by its image in M ⊗R Q.
Now let MR denote the R-module of M ⊗R Q generated by M. Note that MR is a free
R-module, since all torsion-free R-modules are free. Since R is local, we can choose a ba-
sis for MR which consists of elements of M, say e1, ..., en. (Indeed, setting n = rank(MR),
Nakayama’s lemma allows us to ﬁnd a set {e1, ..., en} ⊂ M such that MR =
i R e i. Then we
have a surjective endomorphism of MR, equivalently an automorphism, mapping a basis
onto {e1, ..., en}.) By ﬁxing this basis, we can identify EndR M as an R-subalgebra of the
ring of n × n matrices Matn×n(R), in the obvious way. By assumption on h, some power of
h lies in mR Matn×n(R) ⊆ J (R) Matn×n(R). Thus the image of h in Matn×n(R/J (R)) is nilpo-
tent. The lemma now follows from the fact that over a ﬁeld, any nilpotent matrix has zero
(cid:3)
trace.

2.2. Cohen-Macaulay modules and Gorenstein rings. For the remainder of this sec-
tion, assume R is a Cohen-Macaulay ring which is either a complete local ring or a connected
graded ring. Let m = mR.

Notation 2.6. In the complete local case, let CM(R) denote the category of ﬁnitely generated
maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules, and (following [3]) let L p(R) denote the full subcat-
egory of CM(R) whose objects M have the property that Mp is Rp-free for all nonmaximal
prime ideals p. If R is instead a Cohen-Macaulay connected graded ring, we deﬁne CM(R)
and L p(R) in the same way but restricted to graded modules (keeping the full Hom sets).

Let k = R/mR. Then R is Gorenstein if and only if it is Cohen-Macaulay and dimk(Extdim R
1. If R is Gorenstein, and M ∈ CM(R), then ([6, Theorem 3.3.10]): Exti
R(M, R) = 0 for all i ≥ 1,
and the map M −→ HomR(HomR(M, R), R) given by m 7→ ( f 7→ f (m)) is an isomorphism. We
denote HomR(M, R) by M∗.

(k, R)) =

2.3. Auslander-Reiten sequences.

Deﬁnition 2.7. Let N be an indecomposable in CM(R). Then (cf. [17, Lemma 2.9′]) we may
deﬁne an Auslander-Reiten (AR) sequence starting from N to be a short exact sequence

(2.1)

in CM(R) such that M is indecomposable and the following property is satisﬁed: Any map
N −→ L in CM(R) which is not a split monomorphism factors through p. Equivalently, N
3

/
/
/
is indecomposable and any map L −→ M in CM(R) which is not a split epimorphism factors
through q. The sequence (2.1) is unique if it exists, and is also called the AR sequence
ending in M. Given an AR sequence (2.1), N is called the Auslander-Reiten translate of M,
written τ(M); and τ−1(N) denotes M.

Deﬁnition 2.8. A morphism f : X −→ Y in CM(R) is called an irreducible morphism if
(1) f is neither a split monomorphism nor a split epimorphism, and (2) Given any pair of
morphisms g and h in CM(R) satisfying f = gh, either g is a split epimorphism or h is a
split monomorphism.

2.9. Let L be an indecomposable in CM(R), and assume we have the AR sequence (2.1).
Then the following are equivalent (cf. [17, 2.12 and 2.12′]):

(a) L is isomorphic to a direct summand of E.
(b) There exists an irreducible morphism N −→ L.
(c) There exists an irreducible morphism L −→ M.

Theorem 2.10. (cf. [17, Theorem 3.4], and [3, Theorem 3]) Let M ≇ R be an indecomposable
in CM(R). Then M ∈ L p(R) if and only if there exists an AR sequence ending in M.

Notice also that if R is Gorenstein, applying (_)∗ shows that there exists an AR sequence
ending in M if and only if there exists an AR sequence starting from M. The appendix of
[1] contains a nice proof of Theorem 2.10 in a setting which includes Gorenstein rings of
dimension one.

Lemma 2.11. Assume dim R = 1, and let N ∈ CM(R). Then N ∈ L p(R) if and only if N ⊗R Q
is a projective Q-module.

Proof. The prime ideals of Q correspond to min R. Now use the fact that, since Q is noe-
therian, a Q-module is projective precisely when it is free at all maximal ideals of Q (cf. [8,
(cid:3)
Exercise 4.11]).

(cid:3)

2.12. For the remainder of this section assume furthermore that R is Gorenstein of di-
mension one, and M ≇ R is an indecomposable in L p(R). Then (ignoring a graded shift,
in the graded case; it will not concern us) τ(M) = syzR(M) (cf. [17, 3.11]), where syzR(M)
denotes the syzygy module of M, which is deﬁned to be the kernel of a minimal surjec-
tion onto M by a free R-module. The module τ−1(M) = syz−1
R (M) ∈ L p(R) is determined by
R (M)) ∼= M, and can be computed via syz−1
syzR(syz−1

∼= (syzR(M∗))∗.

Deﬁnition 2.13. Given a ring A, and A-modules X and Y , HomA(X , Y ) denotes
HomA(X , Y )/{maps factoring through projective A-modules}; and EndA(X ) denotes HomA(X , X ).
An A-homomorphism is said to be stably zero if it factors through a projective A-module.

Lemma 2.14. [17, Lemma 3.8] Let A be a commutative ring, and let X and Y be ﬁnitely
generated A-modules. The sequence

HomA(X , A) ⊗A Y

µ /

/ HomA(X , Y )

/ HomA(X , Y )

is exact, where µ : HomA(X , A) ⊗A Y −→ HomA(X , Y ) is given by f ⊗ y 7→ (x 7→ f (x)y).
Lemma 2.15. EndR(M) ∼= Ext1

Proof. Let N = syz−1
R (M). By applying HomR(_, M) to a short exact sequence 0 → M →
F → N → 0 where F is free, we have an exact sequence HomR(F, M) → HomR(M, M) →
Ext1
R(F, M) = 0. It only remains to observe that the image of HomR(F, M) →
HomR(M, M) consists of all endomorphisms factoring through projectives, which simply fol-
(cid:3)
lows from the deﬁnition of projective.

R(N, M) → Ext1

(cid:3)

Remark 2.16. Left M ∈ L p(R) be a nonfree indecomposable. Then EndR M is a (graded-)
local ring (cf. [3, proposition 8]), and therefore so is EndR M. It follows from Lemma 2.15 and
Theorem 2.10 that the ring EndR(M) has a simple socle when considered as a left module
over itself, and that if h : M → M generates this socle then the AR sequence starting from M
equals the pushout via h of the short exact sequence 0 → M → F → syz−1
R (M) → 0 where F is
free. In particular, if ι denotes the given injective map M → F, and 0 → M → X → N → 0 is
the AR sequence starting from M, then X ∼= (M ⊕ F)/{(−h(m), ι(m))|m ∈ M}.

3. TESTING STABLE-VANISHING WITH TRACE.

In this section, let R simply be a commutative ring, let Q = Q(R), and let M be a ﬁnitely
generated R-module such that M ⊗R Q is a projective Q-module. Let (_)∗ denote HomR(_, R).
Notation 3.1. Given an R-algebra B, let DB(_) denote HomR(_, B). Let νB denote DB((_)∗) =
DB ◦ DR(_), and let λB denote the Hom-Tensor adjoint isomorphism λB : DB(M∗ ⊗R _) −→
HomR(_, νBM). We also let µM denote the natural transformation µM : M∗⊗R_ → HomR(M, _ )
given by f ⊗ x 7→ (m 7→ f (m)x). For future reference, we note that for a given R-module X ,
the map λB ◦ (DBµM) : DB HomR(M, X ) −→ HomR(X , νBM) is given by the rule

(3.1)

[λB ◦ DBµM](σ)(x)( f ) = σ(µM( f ⊗ x)) , for all σ ∈ DB HomR(M, X ), x ∈ X , f ∈ M∗.

Let E = Q/R. The exact sequence 0

Lemma 3.2. [1, Appendix]

(1) The map DQµM is an isomorphism on ﬁnitely generated R-modules, and the sequence (3.3)

is exact.

(2) If R is Gorenstein of dimension one, and both M and the input module X lie in CM(R),

then the image of λR ◦ DRµM consists of the stably zero maps X −→ νR M.

Proof. We can identify µM ⊗R Q with µM⊗Q : HomQ(M ⊗R Q,Q) ⊗Q (_ ⊗R Q) −→ HomQ(M ⊗R
Q, _ ⊗R Q), which is an isomorphism because M ⊗R Q is a projective Q-module. Thus DQµM

chasing the diagram (3.2).

Now we assume the hypotheses of (2). Let 0

where the vertical maps are induced by p : F −→ M, and the horizontal maps on the right
are the isomorphisms induced by M ∼= M∗∗ and F ∼= F ∗∗. It is easy to see that the image
of the rightmost vertical map consists of the stably zero maps X −→ M, and it follows that
the third vertical map consists of the stably zero maps X −→ M∗∗. Let H denote the map
HomR(M, X ) −→ HomR(F, X ) induced by p. Since the top row of diagram (3.4) consists
of isomorphisms, establishing surjectivity of the leftmost vertical map, namely DR H, is
sufﬁcient for proving (2). Let N = cok H. By left-exactness of Hom, we have a left-exact
sequence

Lemma 3.3. Assume R is Gorenstein of dimension one, and let M ∈ CM(R) and h ∈ EndR M.
Then h is stably zero if and only if trace(gh⊗Q) ∈ R for all g ∈ EndR M. (Recall the deﬁnition
of trace, Deﬁnition 2.2.)

Proof. Let η denote the isomorphism EndR M −→ HomR(M, M∗∗) induced by M ∼= M∗∗, and
let θ denote (λQ◦DQµM)−1◦ι∗ : HomR(M, M∗∗) −→ HomR(EndR M,Q). It follows from Lemma 3.2
that h is stably zero if and only if [θ(ηh)](g) ∈ R for all g : M −→ M. Thus, by the symmetry
of trace, it sufﬁces to show that [θ(ηh)](g) = trace(h g ⊗ Q). Let σ : EndR M −→ Q denote the
map sending g ∈ EndR M to trace(h g ⊗ Q). Thus, we wish to show θ(ηh) = σ; equivalently,
ι∗(ηh) = (λQ ◦ DQµM)(σ).

Our goal now is to prove Theorem 4.8, which is really a formula for the AR sequence
beginning at M. For this section, let R be a one-dimensional Gorenstein ring which is either
a complete local ring or a connected graded ring. Let p be a minimal prime of R and let
R′ = R/p. Set Q = Q(R), Q′ = Q(R′), and m = mR.

Recall that for a commutative ring A, if M and N are ﬁnitely generated A-submodules of
Q(A), and M contains a faithful element w, i.e. AnnA(w) = 0, then HomA(M, N) is naturally
identiﬁed with (N :Q(A) M) = {q ∈ Q(A)|qM ⊆ N}. Essentially Theorem 4.8 will assert that
the AR sequence beginning at any M supported at p is induced by an element γ ∈ EndR m
which may be found by the following recipe: Pick γ′ ∈ (R′ :Q′ J (R′)) \ R′, lift γ′ from Q′ to
˜γ′ ∈ Q, and ﬁnd z ∈ R such that p = AnnR(z) and z ˜γ′ ∉ R; ﬁnally, set γ = z ˜γ′. We ﬁrst show
that these steps for ﬁnding γ are well-deﬁned.

Notation 4.1. Let F(R′) denote (R′ :Q′ J (R′)).
Lemma 4.2. We have F(R′) ⊆ HomR′ (mR′ , R′), while F(R′) * R′.

Proof. Let D = R′. As mD ⊆ J (D), we have F(D) ⊆ HomD(mD, D). In the complete local
case D is a DVR, while in the connected graded case D is a polynomial ring over a ﬁeld by
Lemma 9.5. Let π denote a generator for mD, and let n be the positive integer such that the
conductor ideal (D :D D) equals πnD. It is clear that πn−1D ⊆ F(D) and πn−1D * D. (cid:3) (cid:3)
Lemma 4.3. We have an R-algebra isomorphism Q/pQ ∼= Q′.

Proof. If x ∈ R is a (homogeneous) nonzerodivisor, we have Rx = Q. To see this, it sufﬁces
to check that a given (homogeneous) nonzerodivisor y ∈ R becomes a unit in Rx. As R y is
m-primary, we have xi = r y for some i ≥ 1 and some r ∈ R. Therefore y is a unit in Rx; hence
x, which equals Q′ by the same argument as
Rx = Q. Now Q/pQ = Q ⊗R R′ = Rx ⊗R R′ = R′
(cid:3)
(cid:3)
above.

Lemma 4.4. Let γ′ be a (homogeneous) element of F(R′) \ R′ (which exists by Lemma 4.2)
and let ˜γ′ be a lift of γ′ to Q (see Lemma 4.3). Then there exists (homogeneous) z ∈ R such
that p = AnnR(z) and ˜γ′ z ∉ R.
Proof. Let ω denote the ideal AnnR(p). Now ω ∼= HomR(R′, R) is, up to a graded shift, a
canonical module for R′ ([6, Theorem 3.3.7] and [6, proposition 3.6.12]), and therefore we
have EndR′ ω ∼= R′ (cf. [6, Theorem 3.3.4] and the proof of [6, proposition 3.6.9b]). We will also
use that p = AnnR(ω) = AnnR(z) for each nonzero z ∈ ω, which is true because all associated
primes of R are minimal, so that any ideal strictly larger than p contains a nonzerodivisor.
Regarding ω as a subset of Q via ω ⊂ R ⊂ Q, suppose that ˜γ′ω ⊆ ω. Then the action of ˜γ′
on ω agrees with the multiplication on ω by some r ∈ R, so ˜γ′ − r ∈ AnnQ(ω) = pQ. But then
γ′ ∈ R′ is a contradiction. So there must exist z ∈ ω such that ˜γ′ z ∉ ω. As AnnQ(p) ∩ R = ω,

we thus have ˜γ′ z ∉ R.
Lemma 4.5. For ˜γ′ ∈ Q and z ∈ R as in Lemma 4.4, we have z ˜γ′ ∈ EndR m.
Proof. From Lemma 4.2 we have γ′mR′ ⊆ R′. Since zR ∼= R′, it follows that ˜γ′ zm ⊆ zR, thus
z ˜γ′ ∈ m∗. It remains to observe that m has no free direct summand. But any proper direct
summand of an ideal has nonzero annihilator; and if m were free R would be regular. (cid:3) (cid:3)

We have now shown that the steps for for ﬁnding γ, given in the introduction of this

section, are well-deﬁned. We need one more preliminary lemma.

Notation 4.7. Let γ′ be a (homogeneous) element of F(R′)\R′, let ˜γ′ be a lift of γ′ to Q and let
z ∈ R (homogeneous) such that p = AnnR(z) and ˜γ′ z ∉ R. (Those steps are well-deﬁned by the
above lemmas.) Let γ = z ˜γ′. Assume M ∈ L p(R) has no free direct summands. Then there
exists no surjection M −→ R, so M∗ = HomR(M, m), hence M ∼= HomR(M, m)∗ is a module
over the ring EndR m. Therefore γ induces an endomorphism of M, by Lemma 4.5. Denote
it by γM. Denote by [γM] the class of γM in EndR M.

have [γM] ∈ soc(EndR M). Moreover, [γM] 6= 0 provided dimR′

an artinian local ring, there exists some i ≥ 1 such that hi ∈ m EndR M, and thus hi ⊗R R′ ∈
m EndR′ (M′). So trace(h ⊗ Q′) ∈ J (R′), by Lemma 2.5. Now using Lemma 4.6, ˜γ′ trace(h ⊗

we have nγ ∉ R, and thus [γM] 6= 0 by Lemma 3.3.

The following lemma, which we use in Section 6, is for locating γ′ when R′ is Gorenstein.
Lemma 4.9. Assume R′ is Gorenstein and connected graded, and let g ∈ HomR′ (mR′ , R′) be
a homogeneous element, and a = deg g. If R′

D(k, D) = 1, where k = D0. Then applying (_)∗ =

HomD(_, D) to the short exact sequence 0 → mD → D → k → 0 yields dimk(m∗

Lemma 4.2, there exists some homogeneous γ′ ∈ F(D)\ D. Then γ′ ∈ m∗

Therefore g = d + d′γ′ for some d ∈ Da and d′ ∈ D. But d = 0 since Da = 0. Thus g ∈ d′F(D) ⊆

5. STABLE AR QUIVERS.

In this section we provide the background for those unfamiliar with stable translation
quivers and their tree classes. Confer, e.g., [1] and [5], although the meaning of “valued” is
different in [5].
Deﬁnition 5.1. A quiver is a directed graph Γ = (Γ0, Γ1), where Γ0 is the set of vertices and
0, φ1 : Γ1 → Γ′
Γ1 is the set of arrows. A morphism of quivers φ : Γ → Γ′ is a pair (φ0 : Γ0 → Γ′
1)
such that φ1 applied to an arrow x → y is an arrow φ(x) → φ(y). For x ∈ Γ0, x− denotes the

8

set { y ∈ Γ0|∃arrow y → x in Γ1}; and x+ = { y ∈ Γ0|∃arrow x → y in Γ1}. Γ is locally ﬁnite if x+
and x− are ﬁnite sets for each x ∈ Γ0. A loop is an arrow from a vertex to itself. A multiple
arrow is a set of at least two arrows from a given vertex to another given vertex.

A valued quiver is a quiver Γ together with a map v : Γ1 → Z≥1 ×Z≥1. By a graph we mean
an undirected graph. A valued graph is a graph G together with speciﬁed integers dx y ≥ 1
and d yx ≥ 1 for each edge x— y.

Deﬁnition 5.2. A stable translation quiver is a locally ﬁnite quiver together with a quiver
automorphism τ called the translation, such that:
• Γ has no loops and no multiple arrows.
• For x ∈ Γ0, x− = τ(x)+.

Given a stable translation quiver (Γ, τ) and a map v : Γ1 → Z≥0 × Z≥0, the triple (Γ, v, τ) is
called a valued stable translation quiver if v(x → y) = (a, b) ⇔ v(τ(y) → x) = (b, a). A stable
translation quiver is connected if it is non-empty and cannot be written as disjoint union of
two subquivers each stable under the translation.

Deﬁnition 5.3. Let C be a full subquiver of a quiver Γ which satisﬁes Deﬁnition 5.2 except
possibly for the no-loop condition. We call C a component of Γ if:

(1) For all vertices x ∈ C, we have τx ∈ C and τ−1 x ∈ C .
(2) C is a union of connected components of the underlying undirected graph of Γ.
(3) There is no proper subquiver of C that satisﬁes (1) and (2).

Deﬁnition 5.4. By a directed tree we shall mean a quiver T, with no loops or multiple
arrows, such that the underlying undirected graph of T is a tree, and for each x ∈ T, the set
x− has at most one element.

Given a directed tree T, there is an associated stable translation quiver ZT deﬁned as
follows. The vertices of ZT are the pairs (n, x) with n ∈ Z and x a vertex of T. The arrows of
ZT are determined by the following rules: Given vertices x, y ∈ T, and n ∈ Z,

• (n, x) → (n, y) ∈ ZT ⇔ x → y ∈ T ⇔ (n, y) → (n − 1, x) ∈ ZT;
• If n′ ∉ {n, n − 1}, there is no arrow (n, x) → (n′, y).

Remark 5.5. Let T be a valued quiver which is also a directed tree. Then there is a unique
extension of v to ZT such that the latter becomes a valued stable translation quiver. Namely,
if v(x → y) = (a, b), then v((n, x) → (n, y)) = (a, b), and v((n, y) → (n − 1, x)) = (b, a).
Lemma 5.6. Let T and T′ be (valued) directed trees. Then ZT ∼= ZT′ as (valued) stable
translation quivers if and only T ∼= T′ as (valued) graphs.

Proof. See [5, proposition 4.15.3].

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

A group Π of automorphisms (commuting with the translation) of a stable translation
quiver Γ is said to be admissible if no orbit of Π on the vertices of Γ intersects a set of the
form {x} ∪ x+ or {x} ∪ x− in more than one point. The quotient quiver Γ/Π, with vertices the
Π-orbits of Γ0, and with the induced arrows and translation, is also a stable translation
quiver. A surjective morphism of stable translation quivers φ : Γ → Γ′ is called a covering if,
for each x ∈ Γ0, the induced maps x− → φ(x)− and x+ → φ(x)+ are bijective. Note that if Π is
an admissible group of automorphisms of Γ,

(5.1)

the canonical projection Γ → Γ/Π is a covering.
9

Theorem 5.7. (Riedtmann Structure Theorem; see [5, Theorem 4.15.6] ) Given a connected
stable translation quiver Γ, there is a directed tree T and an admissible group of automor-
phisms Π ⊆ Aut(ZT) such that Γ ∼= ZT/Π. In particular, we have a covering ZT → Γ. The
underlying undirected graph of T is uniquely determined by Γ, up to isomorphism.

The underlying undirected graph of T is called the tree class of Γ.

Remark 5.8. Formally, the tree class T of Γ is constructed as follows (as in the proof of
Theorem 5.7, which we will not reproduce here). Choose any vertex x ∈ Γ, and deﬁne the
vertices of T to be the set of paths

for which no yi = τ(yi+2). The arrows of T are

(x = y0 → y1 → · · · → yn)

(n ≥ 0)

(x = y0 → y1 → · · · → yn−1) −→ (x = y0 → y1 → · · · → yn) .
Remark 5.9. Suppose Γ is a valued stable translation quiver, and let φ : ZT → Γ be a cover-
ing, which exists by the Theorem. Now ZT becomes a valued stable translation quiver, by
setting v(x → y) = v(φ(x → y)). In particular, T becomes a valued quiver.
Deﬁnition 5.10. The valued tree class of a stable translation quiver Γ is a valued graph
(T, v) where T denotes the tree class of Γ, and v : {edges of T} → Z≥0 × Z≥0 is given as in
Remark 5.9.
Deﬁnition 5.11. Let (Γ, v) be a valued, locally ﬁnite quiver without multiple arrows. For
x → y in Γ, we write v(x → y) = (dx y, d yx). If there is no arrow between x and y, we set
dx y = d yx = 0. Let Q>0 be the set of positive rational numbers.

(i) A subadditive function on (Γ, v) is a Q>0-valued function f on the set of vertices of Γ

such that 2 f (x) ≥

y∈Γ d yx f (y), for each vertex x.

(ii) An additive function on (Γ, v) is a Q>0-valued function f on the set of vertices of Γ such

P

y∈Γ d yx f (y), for each vertex x.

that 2 f (x) =
Lemma 5.12. [5, Theorem 4.5.8] Let (Γ, v) be a connected valued quiver without loops or
multiple arrows. Suppose f is a subadditive function on Γ, and assume Γ has inﬁnitely
many vertices. Then:

P

(1) The underlying valued graph of Γ is an inﬁnite Dynkin diagram.
(2) If f is unbounded, or if f is not additive, then the underlying valued graph of Γ is A∞.

6. THE COHEN-MACAULAY SETTING

The over-arching ideas of this section are largely from [1], which in turn is based partly on
[9]. Since we conﬁne our arguments to the commutative setting, they are sometimes slightly
easier. Also, the proof of [1, Lemma 1.23] is ﬂawed, since its penultimate sentence is false,
and we give a correct version as Lemma 6.17. A principal goal of this section is to provide
some sufﬁcient conditions for guaranteeing that a given component of the stable AR quiver
of a hypersurface is a tube; see Proposition 6.23.

Assume R is a Cohen-Macaulay complete local ring, with maximal ideal m = mR. (But the

same results hold when R is connected graded instead of complete local.)

Deﬁnition 6.1. If M and N are indecomposables in CM(R), let Irr(M, N) denote the module
of nonisomorphisms M −→ N modulo those which are not irreducible. Let kM denote the
division ring (EndR M)/J (EndR M). Thus Irr(M, N) is a right kM-space, and a left kN-space.
10

Deﬁnition 6.2. The Auslander-Reiten quiver of R is the valued quiver deﬁned as follows:

• Vertices are isoclasses of indecomposables in CM(R).
• There is an arrow M → N if and only if there exists an irreducible morphism M → N,
i.e. Irr(M, N) 6= 0. The value v(M → N) of the arrow M → N is (a, b) where a is the
dimension of Irr(M, N) as a right kM-space, and b is the dimension of Irr(M, N) as a
left kN-space.

Recall that we use τ to denote the AR-translate (deﬁned at the end of Deﬁnition 2.7).

Lemma 6.3. Let M and N be indecomposables in L p(R).

(1) If 0 → τN → E → N → 0 is an AR sequence, the number of copies of M appearing in a
direct sum decomposition of E equals the dimension of Irr(M, N) as a right kM-space.
(2) If 0 → M → E′ → τ−1 M → 0 is an AR sequence, then the number of copies of N appear-
ing in a direct sum decomposition of E′ equals the dimension of Irr(M, N) as a left
kN -space.

Proof. See [17, Lemmas 5.5 and 5.6].

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

Remark 6.4. Suppose that k = R/m is algebraically closed. Then in the notation of Lemma 6.3,
we have k = kM = kN , and it therefore follows from Lemma 6.3 that the number of copies
of N appearing in a decomposition of E′ equals the number of copies of M appearing in a
decomposition of E.

Notationally, we allow τ to be a partially-deﬁned morphism on the AR quiver of R; τx is
deﬁned precisely when the vertex x corresponds to a non-projective module in L p(R), by [17,
Theorem 3.4]. The following fact is used in [1], and the proof essentially follows that of [4,
VII 1.4].

Lemma 6.5. Let x → y be an arrow in the AR quiver of R, and let (a, b) = v(x → y). If τy is
deﬁned, then v(τy → x) = (b, a). If τx and τy are both deﬁned, then v(τx → τy) = v(x → y).

Proof. We need not prove the last sentence, as it follows from the previous. Let M and
N ∈ CM(R) be the modules corresponding to x and y respectively. We ﬁrst show kN and
p /
/ 0 be an AR
kτN are isomorphic k-algebras, where k = R/m. Let 0
sequence. Given h ∈ EndR N, there exists a commutative diagram

Indeed, note that hq is not a split epimorphism, because if h is surjective, then h is an
isomorphism, and thus hq is not a split epimorphism because q is not. Therefore, by Deﬁ-
nition 2.7, there exists u : E −→ E such that hq = qu, and the existence of h′ follows.

By the dual argument, any given h′ ∈ EndR(τN) can be ﬁt into a similar commutative

diagram.

We wish to show that h 7→ h′ induces a well-deﬁned map kN → kτN . If so then it is a sur-
jective ring map from a division ring, hence an isomorphism, so we will be done. It sufﬁces to
show that, given any commutative diagram (6.1) such that h is a nonisomorphism, it follows
that h′ is also a nonisomorphism. Suppose, to the contrary, that h is an nonisomorphism

and h′ is an isomorphism. We may assume h′ is the identity map, since we could certainly
compose the diagram (6.1) with a similar diagram which has (h′)−1 on the left. As h is not
a split epimorphism, it factors through q. But then the top sequence in (6.1) splits, cf. [13,
Ch. III, Lemma 3.3]; and this of course is a contradiction. Thus kN

∼= kτN as k-algebras.

In particular, dimk(kN ) = dimk(kτN ). As dimkM Irr(M, N) = dimkM Irr(τN, M) is an imme-
diate consequence of Lemma 6.3, our aim is to show dimkN Irr(M, N) = dimkτN Irr(τN, M). By
the former, we have dimk Irr(M, N) = dimk Irr(τN, M). Thus, dimkN Irr(M, N) = dimk Irr(M, N)/ dimk(kN) =
dimk Irr(τN, M)/ dimk(kτN) = dimkτN Irr(τN, M).
Deﬁnition 6.6. If R is Gorenstein, the stable Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver of R is the
valued quiver deﬁned as in Deﬁnition 6.2, except that the vertices are only the isoclasses of
nonfree indecomposable modules M ∈ L p(R). By a stable AR component, we shall mean a
component (Deﬁnition 5.3) of the stable AR quiver.
Deﬁnition 6.7. Let (Γ, τ) be a translation quiver, and x a vertex of Γ. If x = τn x for some n >
0, we say that x is τ-periodic. A module M ∈ CM(R) is said to be τ-periodic if it corresponds to
a τ-periodic vertex in the AR quiver of R, i.e., M ∼= τn M. When R is Gorenstein of dimension
one, we will omit the preﬁx “τ-” and just say M is periodic.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

The following is well-known.

Lemma 6.8. If (Γ, τ) is a connected translation quiver containing a τ-periodic vertex, then
all of its vertices are τ-periodic.
Proof. If x is a vertex in Γ and τn x = x, then τn induces a permutation on the ﬁnite set
x−, and so some power of τn stabilizes x− pointwise. Thus each vertex in x− is τ-periodic;
(cid:3)
likewise for x+, so every vertex in Γ is τ-periodic by induction.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 6.9. We say that a connected translation quiver is periodic if one, equivalently
all, of its vertices is τ-periodic.
Deﬁnition 6.10. A valued stable translation quiver Γ is called a tube if Γ ∼= ZA∞/〈τn〉 for
some n ≥ 1. If n = 1, Γ is called a homogeneous tube.

Remark 6.11. Let Γ be a connected periodic stable translation quiver, and suppose the
valued tree class of Γ is A∞. Then Γ is a tube. To see this, let Π be an admissible group of
automorphisms of ZA∞ such that Γ ∼= ZA∞/Π. Note that every automorphism of the stable
translation quiver ZA∞ is of the form τn for some n ≥ 0. Thus Π = 〈τn〉 for some n ≥ 0; and
the periodicity implies n ≥ 1.

Notation 6.12. If R is Gorenstein of dimension one, and M is an indecomposable in L p(R),
deﬁne an R-module push(M) as follows. If M is free, let push(M) = 0. Otherwise let push(M)
denote the unique module (up to isomorphism) such that there exists an AR sequence 0 −→
M −→ push(M) −→ syz−1
n
i=1 Mi with each Mi in L p(R),
then we set push(M) =

R (M) −→ 0. More generally, if M =

i=1 push(Mi).

Notation 6.13. (See, e.g., [15, 14.1-14.6].) For an R-module M, let e(M) denote the multi-
nd length(M/mn M), where d = dim R, but
plicity of M. This can be deﬁned as e(M) = limn→∞
the reader may ignore this deﬁnition; we use only the following properties:
• If 0 −→ M′ −→ M −→ M′′ −→ 0 is exact, then e(M) = e(M′) + e(M′′).
• For all M ∈ CM(R), e(M) is a positive integer.

Lemma 6.15. Assume R is Gorenstein of dimension one, and M ∈ L p(R) is indecomposable
and periodic. If push M = X ⊕ F where X has no free direct summands and F is a (possibly
zero) free module, then X is periodic, and eavg(push M) ≤ 2eavg(M).

P

Proof. We know X is periodic from Lemma 6.8. Note that if N ∈ CM(R) is periodic, then
e(τi N) = neavg(N). For each
for any j ∈ Z, and n ∈ N a multiple of the period of N,
integer i, we have by Lemma 6.5 an AR sequence 0 −→ τi+1 M −→ Fi ⊕ τi X −→ τi M −→ 0,
where Fi is a (possibly zero) free module. So e(τi X ) ≤ e(τi+1 M)+ e(τi M), hence
i=1 e(τi X ) ≤
i=1 e(τi M) for each n ∈ N. This inequality gives the desired result by taking
n to be a common multiple of the periods of M and X , and dividing both sides by n. (cid:3) (cid:3)

The following goes back at least to [9] (in a slightly different setting).

Lemma 6.16. Let C be a connected τ-periodic valued stable translation quiver which is a
subquiver of the stable AR quiver of R. Then the valued tree class of C admits a subadditive
function (Deﬁnition 5.11).

Proof. Let T denote the valued tree class (Deﬁnition 5.10) of Γ. By deﬁnition of T, we
have a value-preserving covering φ : ZT → C. Deﬁne a function f : ZT → Q>0 by the rule
f (x) = eavg(φ(x)). We claim that the restriction of f to T is a subadditive function. That is,
y∈T d yx f (y), for each vertex x of T. By Lemma 6.5, d yx = d(τ−1 y)x for all x, y ∈ C,
2 f (x) ≥
hence for all x, y ∈ ZT. In what follows, for any x ∈ T, the sets x− and x+ will always be taken
with respect to ZT; to signify the predecessors of x with respect to T we can use x− ∩ T. If
x ∈ T, then x+ equals the disjoint union of x+ ∩ T and τ−1(x− ∩ T). Now, we have

d yx f (y) =

So subadditivity of f is equivalent to 2 f (x) ≥

y∈x+ d yx f (y). Since φ is a covering,

y∈x+ d yx f (y) =

y∈φ(x)+ d yφ(x)eavg(y), which is bounded by 2eavg(φ(x)) by Lemma 6.15. So f is subaddi-

Lemma 6.17. Assume R is Gorenstein, let M ∈ L p(R) be a nonfree indecomposable, and
suppose there exists an irreducible map from M to itself. Let C denote the component of the
stable AR quiver containing M, and assume C is inﬁnite. Then C is a homogeneous tube with
a loop at the end:

M = X0

X1

X2

X3

· · ·

In particular, τX i

∼= X i for all X i ∈ C.

Proof. First we show that M ∼= τM. If not, then the AR sequence ending in M is 0 −→ τM −→
M ⊕ τM ⊕ N −→ M −→ 0 for some N ∈ CM(R). Then e(N) = 0, hence N = 0. Now Miyata’s
Theorem [16, Theorem 1] says that the given AR sequence splits, which is a contradiction.
So τM ∼= M.

13

Since C has a loop, it does not satisfy the deﬁnition of stable translation quiver (Deﬁni-
tion 5.2). But removing the loops in C (and keeping all vertices and all non-loop arrows), we
get a τ-periodic connected stable translation quiver; call it Γ, and let T denote valued tree
class of Γ. Now T admits a subadditive function given by eavg, as in the proof of 6.16. From
the fact that Γ is not a full subquiver of the AR quiver of R, it follows that eavg is strictly
subadditive (i.e., not additive). As Γ is inﬁnite and τ-periodic, T must be inﬁnite. Therefore
T ∼= A∞ by Lemma 5.12, and Γ ∼= A∞/〈τ〉, by Remark 6.11. So Γ has the form

Suppose M = X i for some i > 0. Then we have an AR sequence 0 −→ X i → X i ⊕ X i−1 ⊕ X i+1 ⊕
F → X i → 0, for some free module F, so e(X i) ≥ e(X i−1) + e(X i+1). But the AR sequences
ending in X i−1 and X i+1 give us 2e(X i+1) > e(X i) and 2e(X i−1) ≥ e(X i). These inequalities
(cid:3)
contradict the previous one, so M = X0.

The following “Maranda-type result” corresponds to Lemma 1.24 in [1]. In our setting,
namely that of a Cohen-Macaulay complete local ring, this result is well-known (but possibly
has only been stated for the case when the ring is an isolated singularity). The following
proof can be found, for example, in [12, proposition 15.8] and its corollaries.

Lemma 6.18. Let M and N be nonisomorphic indecomposables in L p(R), and let x ∈ m be

the horizontal and vertical maps into HomR(M, N/xM) can be identiﬁed with θ and θ2 re-
spectively, while the rightmost vertical map is zero. Therefore a diagram chase yields

im(θ) = im(θ2).
(6.3)
We claim i = 2 will sufﬁce. Suppose M/x2 M is not indecomposable. Then there exists a
nontrivial idempotent e ∈ EndR(M/x2M). Consider the equation (6.3) in the case M = N;

now θ and θ2 are of course ring homomorphisms. Since EndR M is (noncommutative-) local,
so is im θ, and therefore θ2(e) is either 0 or 1. Since 1 − e ∈ EndR(M/x2 M) is also a nontrivial
idempotent, we may assume θ2(e) = 0, i.e. im e ⊆ xM/x2M. But then e2 = 0 is a contradiction.
Now suppose ϕ : M/x2 M −→ N/x2N is an isomorphism, with inverse ψ : N/x2N −→ M/x2M.
By (6.3), there exist ˜ϕ : M −→ N such that ˜ϕ⊗R (R/x) = ϕ⊗R (R/x), and ˜ψ: M −→ N such that
˜ψ⊗R (R/x) = ψ⊗R (R/x). By Nakayama’s Lemma, ˜ϕ and ˜ψ are surjective. Thus ˜ψ ˜ϕ is a surjec-
tive endomorphism, equivalently, an isomorphism; and thus ˜ϕ is an isomorphism. (cid:3) (cid:3)

Lemma 6.19. Assume dim R = 1, and let M be an indecomposable in CM(R). Then there
exists an irreducible morphism M −→ R if and only if M is isomorphic to a direct summand
of m. If R is Gorenstein, there exists an irreducible morphism R −→ M if and only if M is
isomorphic to a direct summand of m∗.

Proof. Write m as a direct sum of indecomposables, m =
i mi. Let ιi denote the inclusion
map mi ,→ R. To see that ιi is irreducible, take a factorization ιi = h g in CM(R), where h is
not a split epimorphism. Then h is not onto, so im h ⊆ m. Then if h′ denotes the map into m
given by x 7→ h(x), and pi denotes the projection m ։ mi, we have that pi h′ g = 1mi, so g is a
split monomorphism; hence ιi is irreducible. Now let M be an indecomposable in CM(R) and
let f : M −→ R be an irreducible morphism. Let ι denote the inclusion map m ,→ R. Since f
is not a split epimorphism, im f ⊆ m, hence f = ιg for some g : M −→ m. As ι is certainly not
a split epimorphism, g is a split monomorphism.

L

For the last sentence of the statement, note that the irreducible maps from R are obtained
(cid:3)

by dualizing the irreducible maps into R.

(cid:3)

We recall the Harada-Sai Lemma:

Lemma 6.20. [4, VI. Cor. 1.3] Let Λ be an artin algebra (e.g. a commutative artinian ring). If
f i : Mi → Mi+1 are nonisomorphisms between indecomposable modules Mi for i = 1, ..., 2n − 1
and length(Mi) ≤ n for all i, then f2n−1 · · · f1 = 0.

Lemma 6.21. [1, proposition 1.26] Assume R is Gorenstein of dimension one, and m is inde-
composable; and suppose R has a stable AR component C which is ﬁnite. Then C consists of
all isoclasses of non-projective indecomposables in CM(R).

Proof. As C is ﬁnite, Lemma 6.18 implies that we can take x ∈ m such that for each pair
M ≇ N in C, M/xM and N/xN are nonisomorphic indecomposable modules.

We may assume R is not regular, and therefore m is not free. Now ﬁrst we show m ∈ C.
Suppose not; then there are no irreducible maps to R from any module in C (Lemma 6.19).
Therefore if N ∈ C and N → N′ is any irreducible map in CM(R), N′ must lie in C (since
L p(R) is closed under syz−1
R , and therefore under irreducible maps by consideration of AR
sequences). Pick a module M ∈ C. By replacing x by a power of itself if necessary, we can
choose f : M → R such that f (M) * xR, i.e.
f ⊗R (R/x) 6= 0. Since f is not a split mono-
morphism, and there exists an AR sequence beginning in M, f equals a sum of maps of the
form gh, where h is an irreducible map between modules in C. Since g ∈ HomR(N, R) for
some N ∈ C, g is not a split monomorphism, and can in turn be written as a sum of maps of
the form kl where l is an irreducible map in C; now f =
klh. Continue this process until
i g ih2n−1,i · · · h1,i where each h j,i is an irreducible map in C,
we have written f as a sum
and n = max{length(N/xN)|N ∈ C}. Note that each h j,i ⊗R (R/x) is a nonisomorphism by our
15

P

assumption on x together with Lemma 6.17. Therefore, Lemma 6.20 implies f ⊗R (R/x) = 0,
contradiction. Thus m ∈ C.

Now just suppose C omits some indecomposable nonfree M ∈ CM(R). Again choose f : M →
R such that f ⊗R (R/x) 6= 0. Note that any map to R which is not a split epimorphism factors
through m. Whereas in the previous paragraph we reached a contradiction via Lemma 6.20,
by “stacking irreducible maps while moving forwards through C”, we now obtain a contra-
(cid:3)
diction by “stacking irreducible maps while moving backwards through C ∪ {R}”.

(cid:3)

Remark 6.22. Assume R is Gorenstein and let C be a stable AR component without loops.
Then C is a valued stable translation quiver (by Lemma 6.5) and therefore has a valued
tree class T (Deﬁnition 5.10). Then T carries the information of how many nonfree direct
summands push(M) and push(push(M)) (in general, pushi(M)) have for modules M ∈ C. Let
us explain further. Let x be the vertex in C corresponding to M, and let n =
d yx.

X(x→ y)∈C
n
Then n is the number of nonfree summands in push(M); that is, push(M) = F ⊕
i=1 X i
where F is a (possibly zero) free module, and the X i are (not necessarily nonisomorphic)
nonfree indecomposables in L p(R). We have a value-preserving covering φ : ZT → C, and
after possibly composing φ with a power of τ, we have x ∈ φ(T), say x = φ(u). Since φ : ZT →
C is a covering,

Proposition 6.23. (cf. [1, Lemma 1.23 and Theorem 1.27]) Assume R is Gorenstein of di-
mension one, m is indecomposable, and CM(R) has inﬁnitely many isoclasses of indecompos-
ables. Let C be a periodic component of the stable AR quiver of R, and suppose that either
R is a reduced hypersurface and C has no loops, or that there exists some M ∈ C such that
push(push(M)) = X ⊕ Y ⊕ F for some indecomposables X and Y , and some possibly-zero free
module F. Then, C is a tube.

Proof. If C has a loop, then by Lemma 6.17, for every M ∈ C, the module push M has two
nonfree indecomposable summands, and therefore push(push(M)) has four. So we may as-
sume C has no loops. Thus C is a valued stable translation quiver, and we have a valued
directed tree T and a value-preserving covering φ : ZT → C. Let the function f : ZT → Q>0
be given by f (x) = eavg(φ(x)). As seen in Lemma 6.16, f restricts to a subadditive function
on T. Since φ is surjective, every vertex of C lies in the τ-orbit of a vertex in φ(T). Note
also that C has inﬁnitely many vertices, by Lemma 6.21. Therefore T is inﬁnite, so it is an
inﬁnite Dynkin diagram by Lemma 5.12. If R is a reduced then {e(M)|M ∈ C} is unbounded
(see [17, Theorem 6.2]); and so if R is a reduced hypersurface (and thus all modules in C
have period 2) then f is unbounded. Then T ∼= A∞, by Lemma 5.12. If the alternate con-
dition holds, we get T ∼= A∞ by eliminating the other inﬁnite Dynkin diagrams, in light of
(cid:3)
Remark 6.22. Thus C is a tube, by Remark 6.11.

7. AN EXAMPLE.

In this section, we apply the results of the previous sections to determine the shape
(namely, a tube) of some components of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the ring ˆR deﬁned
16

in 7.4, below. Recall that a hypersurface, i.e. a regular (graded-) local ring modulo a nonze-
rodivisor, is always Gorenstein.

7.1. Let S be a regular (graded-) local ring, and f ∈ S a nonzero element. Let R = S/ f S. A
matrix factorization of f is a pair of matrices (ϕ, ψ), with entries in S, such that ϕψ = ψϕ =
f idl×l for some l > 0. As consequences of the deﬁnition, we have cok ϕ ∼= cok(ϕ ⊗S R), and
([17, 7.2.2])

(7.1)

im(ϕ ⊗S R) = ker(ψ ⊗S R) and im(ψ ⊗S R) = ker(ϕ ⊗S R).

In particular, cok ϕ and cok ψ are periodic R-modules, of period two.
Remark 7.2. Let (ϕ, ψ) and (ϕ′, ψ′) be matrix factorizations of f . Let n1 and n2 be the
integers such that ϕ is n1-by-n1 and ϕ′ is n2-by-n2. Given h : cok ϕ −→ cok ϕ′, there of
course exist α : S(n1) −→ S(n2) and β : S(n1) −→ S(n2) making the diagram

If (ϕ, ψ) is a matrix factorization such that ϕ and ψ each contains no unit entry, then

7.3. Let (ϕ, ψ) be a reduced matrix factorization, let M = cok ϕ, and assume that R, M and
γ satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 4.8. Pick α and β lifting γM ∈ EndR M in the sense of
Remark 7.2. One may check that the valid choices for α are precisely those choices such
that ψα = γψ after passing to R. By Remark 2.16, push(M) ∼= (im(ψ ⊗S R)⊕ R(n))/{(−γc, c)|c ∈
im(ψ ⊗S R)}, where n denotes the side length of the matrices ϕ and ψ. Then we see that

7.4. Let k be a ﬁeld, of characteristic not equal to 2, and let us set up a connected graded
hypersurface R as follows. Let p and q be relatively prime integers ≥ 3, and let S = k[x, y]
be the graded polynomial ring such that S0 = k, deg x = q, and deg y = p. Let f ∈ S be a
homogeneous polynomial which is not divisible by x. Let g = (bxp + yq) f , where b ∈ k, and b
is allowed to be zero. Now, let R = k[x, y]/(g). The m-adic completion of R is ˆR = k[|x, y|]/(g).
Let v = deg( f )/p, which is an integer because x ∤ f . We assume that f − yv ∈ xS. Lastly,
assume that there are inﬁnitely many isoclasses of indecomposables in CM(R).

Now ﬁx an ideal of R of the form I = (xm, yn), where 1 ≤ m < p − 1 and 2 ≤ n < q. We will
show that the component of Γ ˆR containing ˆI is a tube, by showing that push(push( ˆI)) has
only two indecomposable summands, and applying Proposition 6.23. However, we will work
over R:

Remark 7.5. Let C be a component of ΓR. Now consider the valued translation quiver C′
obtained from C by identifying vertices x and y when they correspond to modules which are
merely graded-shifts of one another, where a “graded-shift” of a module M means a module

M(i) deﬁned by M(i) j = Mi+ j. By [3, Theorem 3], C′ is naturally identiﬁed with a component
of Γ ˆR. Therefore we might as well work over R, and just try not to keep track of the grading
on M and the grading on push(M) simultaneously.
Notation 7.6. Let γ = yq−1 f /x ∈ Q(R). If b 6= 0, set R′ = S/(bxp + yq)S; if b = 0, set R′ =
S/yS ∼= k[x]. In either case, R′ is a domain:
Lemma 7.7. If b 6= 0, then S/(bxp + yq)S is a domain.
Proof. As S is factorial, it sufﬁces to show bxp + yq is irreducible. Since a product ss′ fails to
be homogeneous when either s or s′ does, bxp + yq is either irreducible or equal to a product
of homogeneous nonunits. Let s and s′ be homogeneous elements satisfying ss′ = bxp + yq,
and assume s is a nonunit. Then s has a term of the form αxi for α ∈ k \ {0}, so that q| deg s.
(cid:3)
Likewise p| deg s, and thus deg s = deg(bxp + yq), hence deg s′ = 0, so s′ is a unit.

(cid:3)

We will use the following piece of aritheoremetic several times. We omit the easy proof.

Lemma 7.8. If b1 < q and b2 < 0, or if b1 < 0 and b2 < p, then b1 p + b2 q ∉ pN + qN.

Lemma 7.9. Let (ϕ, ψ) be a reduced matrix factorization of g and such that each indecom-
posable direct summand of cok ϕ has rank, and char k does not divide any of these ranks.

Let α be a matrix such that ψα = γψ after passing to R. Then, push(cok ϕ) = cok

ϕ −α
0 ψ ¶

.

µ

Proof. By 7.3 we only need to check that γ agrees with Notation 4.7, and the indecomposable
summands of cok ϕ satisfy the hypotheses in Theorem 4.8. If b 6= 0 then R′ = S/(bxp + yq)S
and we take γ′ = yq−1/x ∈ HomR′ (mR′ , R′), and set z = f . Let Q = Q(R) and Q′ = Q(R′).
As deg(yq−1/x) = p(q − 1) − q ∉ pN + qN by Lemma 7.8, we have γ′ ∈ (R′ :Q′ J (R′)) \ R′ by
Lemma 4.9. So γ = yq−1 f /x agrees with Notation 4.7. If b = 0, then R′ = S/yS and we take
γ′ = 1/x ∈ (R′ :Q′ J (R′)) \ R′ and set z = yq−1 f . Again γ = yq−1 f /x agrees with Notation 4.7.
It only remains to note that M ⊗R Q′ is a free Q′-module of rank equal to that of M ⊗R Q, by
(cid:3)
Lemma 4.3.

(cid:3)

In preparation for what immediately follows, let us observe that g − yq+v ∈ xmS. Indeed,
we have by assumption f − yv ∈ xS, and deg f = deg(yv) = pv. So if xi y j is a monomial
occurring in f − yv, then we have i > 0, and qi + p j = pv. Since gcd(p, q) = 1, i is therefore
a positive multiple of p; in particular, i > m. Thus, if ≡ denotes congruence modulo xm, we
have f − yv ≡ 0, and g − yq+v = (bxp + yq) f − yq+v ≡ yq( f − yv) ≡ 0.

The reader can check directly that αϕ = −γϕ. In other words,

2, Lemma 7.9 gives cok θ = push(cok ξ) = push(push(I)). By Proposition 6.23, in order to show
the component of Γ ˆR containing I is a tube, it sufﬁces to show that cok θ = X ⊕Y ⊕F, for some
indecomposables X and Y and some possibly-zero free module F. It sufﬁces to do this for
im θ instead of cok θ. We clarify that the term the term “indecomposable” is unambiguous:

Lemma 7.12. [3, Lemma 1] Given an indecomposable N in L p(R) (i.e., N has no proper
ˆN is indecomposable in L p( ˆR). In particular, N is
graded direct summand), we have that
indecomposable as an R-module.

We state the above discussion as a lemma.

Lemma 7.13. In order to establish that the component of the AR quiver containing ˆI is a
tube, it sufﬁces to show that im θ = X ⊕ Y for some graded modules X and Y each having no
proper graded direct summand.

Assume M = M′⊕M′′ for some nonzero graded summands M′ and M′′; now, by Lemma 7.13,
producing a contradiction will complete our overall argument. Note that deg c4 < deg c j for
all j ≥ 3 different from 4. Since R is connected, it follows that c4 lies in either M′ or M′′; let
us assume c4 ∈ M′. Let π : M ⊕ (R c1 + R c2) → M′′ denote the projection map onto M′′, with
the goal of showing that π = 0. We have π(c1) = π(c2) = π(c4) = 0. Also immediate is π(c3) = 0
since xm c3 = yq+v−n c4 and x is a nonzerodivisor.

Let r3, ..., r8 ∈ R be homogeneous elements such that

deg(r8) = (−n + 1)p + q does not lie in Np + Nq by Lemma 7.8, and so r6 = r7 = r8 = 0.

Hence r5 = 0. Therefore π(c5) = r3c3 + r4c4 ∈ ker(π), hence π(c5) = 0 as π is idempotent; and

8. ANOTHER OBSERVATION: syz([γM]).

In this section, assume R is a reduced complete local Gorenstein (but not regular) ring of
dimension one, let m = mR , Q = Q(R), and ﬁx some indecomposable nonfree M ∈ L p(R). We
aim to prove Proposition 8.7, which (after some additional assumptions) states the relation-
ship between the socle elements [γM] and [γsyz M] with respect to the R-algebra isomorphism
syzR : EndR M −→ EndR(syzR(M)). Let MR denote the R-submodule of M ⊗R Q generated by
M, and assume the following: MR is a free R-module which possesses a basis consisting of
elements in M. This is true if R is a domain, since R is in that case a DVR.

Notation 8.1. Fix γ ∈ J (R)∗ \ R, and ﬁx elements e1, ..., en ∈ M forming a free R-basis for
MR. Given h ∈ EndR M, let h denote the unique R-linear endomorphism of MR extending
h. We regard h is an n-by-n matrix with entries in R. Let I cd = (R :R R), the conductor ideal.

Lemma 8.2. We have γMR ⊆ M, and I cd(MR) ⊂

i R e i.

Proof. As (R :R J (R)) = (I cd :R J (R)), we have γJ (R) ⊆ I cd. Therefore (Rγ)m ⊆ (Rγ)J (R) ⊆
I cd ⊆ m, which says that Rγ ⊆ EndR m. Since M ∼= HomR(M, m)∗ is an EndR m-module, we
(cid:3)
obtain (Rγ)M ⊆ M, equivalently γMR ⊆ M. That I cd(MR) ⊂

i R e i is obvious.

(cid:3)

L

We have the following immediate consequence.

L

Lemma 8.3. Let A ∈ EndR(MR), i.e. A is an n × n matrix with entries in R (recall that we
have a ﬁxed basis, {e1, ..., en}). If each entry of A lies in γR, then A sends M into M. If each
entry of A lies in I cd, then A|M : M → M is stably zero.

Lemma 8.4. There exists f ∈ EndR M satisfying the following conditions:

(i) [ f ] generates soc(EndR M);

21

(ii) all nonzero entries of f lie in Rγ.
(iii) the ﬁrst column of f is its only nonzero column.
(iv) f 1,1 = γ.

Proof. If we take an n×n matrix A with A1,1 = γ and all other entries zero, then by Lemma 8.3,
A = h for some endomorphism h ∈ EndR M. As trace(h ⊗ Q) = trace(h) = γ ∉ R, h is sta-
bly nonzero by Lemma 3.3. Therefore by essentiality of the socle of EndR M, there exists
g ∈ EndR M such that [gh] generates soc(EndR M). By Lemma 3.3, there exists h′ ∈ EndR M
such that trace(ghh′ ⊗R Q) ∉ R, i.e. trace(h′ gh ⊗R Q) ∉ R. As h′ gh is stably nonzero by
Lemma 3.3 once more, [h′ gh] generates soc(EndR M). Let f = h′ gh. Now trace( f ⊗R Q) =
trace( f ) = f 1,1 ∈ (γR) \ R. Therefore f 1,1 = uγ for some unit u ∈ R. Finally, replacing f by
(cid:3)
u−1 f , the result still sends M into M, by Lemma 8.3.

(cid:3)

Note that syzR is in general a well-deﬁned functor on the stable category. In particular it

gives an isomorphism of R-algebras EndR M −→ EndR(syzR(M)).

For the remainder, assume R is a domain, and assume k = R/m is algebraically closed.

Proposition 8.5. If f ∈ EndR M and g ∈ EndR(syzR M) are given such that [ f ] ∈ soc(EndR M)
and [g] = syzR([ f ]), then trace f + trace g ∈ R.

Proof. By Lemma 3.3, trace induces well-deﬁned maps EndR M −→ R/R and EndR(syzR M) −→
R/R. As syzR gives an isomorphism of R-algebras EndR M −→ EndR(syzR M), it restricts to
an isomorphism on socles, which are R-simple due to k being algebraically closed. Because
of these remarks, we can take our pick of f and g, as long as [ f ] 6= 0 and [g] = syzR([ f ]);
we will choose f as in Proposition 8.4. Let n = rank(M), and ν > n be the minimal number
of generators of M. Let ξ1, ..., ξν be a set of generators for M, such that {e1 = ξ1, ..., en = ξn}
n
i=1 wi, j e i, for wi, j ∈ R. Since
is an R-basis for MR. For each ξ j we have an equation ξ j =
R = R + J (R) (due to k being algebraically closed), we may assume that for each j > n, and
for each i, we have wi, j ∈ J (R) and therefore wi, jγ ∈ I cd.

P

Take a free cover π : F −→ M sending i-th basis element to ξi. Since f ∈ EndR M is as in
Proposition 8.4, there is a ν × ν matrix A : F −→ F such that πA = f π, with the following
properties. Columns 2 through n of A are zero. In addition, A i j = w1 j f i1 for (i, j) ∈ {1, ..., n}×
{n + 1, ..., ν}, and A i j = 0 for (i, j) ∈ {n + 1, ..., ν} × {n + 1, ..., ν}. Set N = ker(π), and let ~r =

and by the above equation this equals (A i1 − f i1)r1. In other words, A~r = r1~v where ~v =
[v1, ..., vν]T ∈ F is given by vi = A i1 − f i1. So if we let g ∈ EndR N be the restriction of A, we
see that the image of g has rank 1. We also see that the A2~r = A(r1~v) = r1v1~v, so that v1,
which equals A1,1 − γ, is an eigenvalue for g. Our goal is to show that trace(g) + γ ∈ R. Since
trace(g) = trace(g ⊗R Q) and im(g ⊗R Q) ∼= Q, the following lemma ﬁnishes the proof. (cid:3) (cid:3)

Proposition 8.7. We have rank(syzR M) · syz([γM]) + rank(M) · [γsyz M] = 0.

Proof. Since soc EndR(M) is R-simple, the map soc EndR(M) −→ R/R, induced by trace,
is injective. We also know that [γM] ∈ soc EndR(M), by Theorem 4.8. Therefore [γM] =
rank(M) · [ f ] if we take f ∈ EndR M as in Lemma 8.4; and Proposition 8.5 implies [γsyz M] =
(cid:3)

9. APPENDIX.

In this appendix we record some lemmas for reduced connected graded rings of dimension

one. The following theorem is well-known.

Theorem 9.1. Let B be one-dimensional, noetherian, local domain with integral closure B
and mB-adic completion ˆB. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) ˆB is a domain. (“B is analytically irreducible.”)
(2) B is local and ˆB is reduced. (“B is unibranched and analytically unramiﬁed.”)
(3) B is local and ﬁnitely generated as a B-module.

Notation 9.2. If R is a connected graded ring, let ˆR denote the completion of R with respect
to its graded maximal ideal, m.

Lemma 9.3. Let R be a reduced connected graded ring. Then:

(1) The integral closure of R in R[nonzerodivisors]−1 coincides with the integral closure
i≥0 R i

of R in Q = R[graded nonzerodivisors]−1, our deﬁnition of R. Moreover, R =
is an N-graded subring of Q.

L

i≥0 R i.

(2) We have ˆR =
(3) The completion, ˆR, is also reduced. If R is a domain, then ˆR is a domain.
(4) The integral closure, R, is ﬁnitely generated as an R-module.
(5) The integral closure of the completion, ˆR, is ﬁnitely generated as an ˆR-module.

Q

Proof. Statement (1) is [11, Corollary 2.3.6]. Statement (2) can be checked by noting that
{mi}i is coﬁnal with {
j≥i R j}i, and checking that the completion of R with respect to the
i≥0 R i. From (2) we see that ˆR is reduced, resp. a domain,
latter ﬁltration is isomorphic to
if R is such. As R is a ﬁnitely generated algebra over the ﬁeld R0, (4) is a consequence of [14,
Theorem 72]. The last assertion is a consequence of Theorem 9.1 (alternatively, it follows
(cid:3)
from (4)).

it is a DVR; let π ∈ ˆD be a uniformizing parameter. So π ˆD =
