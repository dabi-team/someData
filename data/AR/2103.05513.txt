Abstract: For over five decades the procedure termed maximum-entropy (M-E) has been used 
to “sharpen” structure in spectra, optical and otherwise.  However, this is a contradiction:  by 
modifying data, this approach violates the fundamental M-E principle, which is to extend, in a 
model-independent way, trends established by low-index Fourier coefficients into the white-
noise  region.    The  Burg  derivation,  and  indirectly  the  prediction-error  equations  on  which 
sharpening  is  based,  both  lead  to  the  correct  solution,  although  this  has  been  consistently 
overlooked.    For  a  single  Lorentzian  line  these  equations  can  be  solved  analytically.    The 
resultant  lineshape  is  an  exact  autoregressive  model-1  (AR(1))  replica  of  the  original, 
demonstrating how the M-E reconstruction extends low-index Fourier coefficients to the digital 
limit, and illustrating why this approach works so well for lineshapes resulting from first-order 
decay processes.  By simultaneously retaining low-index coefficients exactly and eliminating 
Gibbs oscillations, M-E noise filtering is quantitatively superior to that achieved by any linear 
method, including the high-performance filters recently proposed.  Examples are provided.

Introduction 

The  goal  of  spectroscopy  is  information,  and  enormous  effort  has  gone  into  improving 
capabilities either by enhancing structure or reducing noise.  Noise reduction, either linear or 
nonlinear, depends on information residing in correlations between data points whereas noise 
is  uncorrelated.    Hence  information  is  contained  in  low-order  Fourier  coefficients,  whereas 
high-order coefficients are dominated by noise.  

Extracting  information  from  spectra  by  linear  methods  generally  depends  on  noise 
reduction,  whether  to  obtain  cleaner  results  for  inspection,  fit  model  lineshapes  with  less 
uncertainty, or enhance structure by differentiation, either as an intrinsic part of data acquisition 
or  by  numerical  differentiation  afterward.    Linear  methods  reduce  noise  by  attenuating  or 
eliminating high-order coefficients either through reciprocal- (Fourier-) space (RS) filtering or 
direct-  (spectral-)  space  (DS)  convolution.    While  noise  is  reduced,  the  associated  cutoffs 
generate Gibbs oscillations, creating new problems.  

By now, linear methods are well understood.  In particular, recent work has shown that the 
optimum linear approach for preserving information while reducing noise is done with high-
performance filters such as cosine-terminated [1] or high-order Gauss-Hermite  filters [1–5], 
with parameters established by the RS behavior of the data [1,3–5].  The best filters avoid the 
Butterworth  approach  of  eliminating  as  many  low-order  derivatives  as  possible  in  RS 
expansions  of  transfer  functions  about 
,  where  n  is  the  coefficient  index,  in  favor  of 
engineering improved cutoffs.  However, Gibbs-oscillation concerns remain.   

Nonlinear approaches offer new capabilities, for example retaining low-index coefficients 
exactly  but  eliminating  Gibbs  oscillations  by  extrapolating  trends  established  by  these 
coefficients into informationally inaccessible regions.  For example, one can least-squares fit 
model  functions  to  spectra  in  DS  or  coefficients  in  RS,  in  the  latter  case  using  the  fitted 
functions to replace coefficients in the white-noise region [5].   

0nIn  principle  the  maximum-entropy  (M-E)  method  offers  a  better  alternative,  because 
extrapolations are done in a most-probable, model-independent way.  However, despite the fact 
that the correct approach follows directly from Burg’s work [6,7] in the 1960’s and indirectly 
from  the  prediction-error  work  of  Kolmonov  and  Wiener  [8–10]  on  weakly  stationary  time 
series in the 1940’s, this has never been explored.  From the beginning, what is termed M-E 
has  been  used  to  “sharpen”  or  “whiten”  structure  in  spectra  [11–14],  thereby  violating  the 
fundamental M-E principle of keeping the data intact.  While Burg’s derivation is more relevant 
to filtering than the W-K approach of extracting a single harmonic buried in weakly stationary 
noise, the latter theory was already well developed when Burg did his work, so he modified the 
final step of his derivation to conform to the prediction-error result.  By now the prediction-
error method has been thorougly investigated empirically [7,11,15,16] and used in many fields, 
including for example geophysics [12], astronomy [17,18], X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
[13,19–23],  Raman  scattering  [14,24–28],  and  others  [29–31].    We  have  found  only  one 
reference [14] where the correct approach has even been mentioned, let alone used. 

Our goals in the present work are to investigate the properties of the overlooked solution, 
understand the mechanism by which it functions, and to use it to reduce or even eliminate noise 
in  spectra.    For  a  single  Lorentzian  structure  we  find  that  the  M-E  equations  can  be  solved 
exactly.    This  solution  involves  only  the  two  lowest-index  coefficients,  and  yields  an  exact 
autoregressive replica (AR(1) in prediction-error terms) of the original.  Replication is the result 
of a combination of two nonlinearities to form a third, the approximate Lorentzian itself.  This 
solution  explains  not  only  why  the  correct  M-E  procedure  reconstructs  digital  Fourier 
coefficients to all accessible orders, but also why it applies so well to spectra with structure 
arising  from  first-order  decay  processes.    By  retaining  low-order  coefficients  exactly  and 
eliminating Gibbs oscillations, the correct M-E solution is quantitatively superior to any form 
of linear filtering, with minimal additional computational effort. 

2.  Theory 

2.1 Fourier analysis 

The  M-E  approach  is  based  on  digital  Fourier  analysis.    Because  digital  methods  are 
intrinsically  periodic, data should be pre-processed with either internal [32] or external [33] 
methods of removing principal components resulting  from  endpoint discontinuities in either 
value or slope, so the mathematics does not treat these singularities as legitimate critical points.  
Because  their  broadening  is  zero,  these  discontinuities  can  exert  an  outsized  influence  on 
results.  Second and third constraints follow in that spectra to be processed must be real and 
positive definite.  For spectra with negative excursions this is easily fixed by adding a constant 
background. 

To define procedures, let

Burg’s result differs in the following ways.   At Eq. (17), Burg sets

term 
 of the noise power of the 
prediction-error  equivalent,  and  discards  the  last-line  equation,  replacing  it  with  the 
requirement that in a recursive solution of Eq. (17), 
 must be minimized at each step.  These 
changes  map  Eq.  (17)  onto  the  prediction-error  approach,  except  that  in  prediction-error 
calculations,  the 
 are  autocorrelations,  not  Fourier  coefficients.    These  are  natural 
interpretations  of  the  prediction-error  formulation,  which  is  intended  to  recover  signal 
harmonics buried in noise in time-series data.  The result is a significant enhancement of signal-
harmonic spectra, to the extent that these can even appear as delta functions.  This variant will 
be discussed in more detail elsewhere.

third nonlinearity, the original Lorentzian.  The Fourier transform of Eq. (25) therefore projects 
the trend established by – in this case two – low-order Fourier coefficients into the white-noise 
region, which is why the correct M-E theory works.  In effect, the combination of the Toeplitz 
matrix and Eqs. (17) and (19) do a Fourier inversion, yielding a periodic replica of the original 
spectrum. 

4.  Discussion 

While Eqs. (24) reduce to a Lorentzian lineshape  in the limit of zero broadening, there is a 
fundamental difference between Eq. (20) and Eqs. (10) and (24b).  The latter two are periodic 
whereas Eq. (20) is not.  Hence Eq. (24b) may be termed more accurately a pseudo-Lorentzian.

Equation (26b) is identical to Eq. (24b) except for the correction term due to the truncation of 
the  sum.    The  extra  term  describes  the  Gibbs  oscillations  that  result  from  the  “ideal”  linear 
filter, where all RS coefficients up to a white-noise cutoff are multiplied by 1, and everything 
beyond by zero.  While high-performance linear filters use a graded cutoff, the resulting Gibbs 
oscillations remain of the order of those described in Eq. (26b).   

We now consider poles.  Letting 

, in the usual z-transform notation, the polynomial 
in the denominator of Eq. (19) can be factored into a product of  M poles.  Let one such pole

incorporation of extra poles acts to improve the fit to the data.  

Given the above, the prediction-error approach can also be understood qualitatively.  As 
noted  above,  in  solving  Eq.  (17)  identifications  and  procedures  are  changed.    In  particular, 
replacing the final equation in the  matrix with the condition that the power be minimized at 
 as  close  to  the  unit  circle  as  possible,  resulting  in  a

structure  that  is  sharper  than  what  would  be  obtained  from  the  direct  solution  of  Eq.  (17).  
Sharpening is thus understood. 

5.  Applications 

The  primary  objective  of  the  present  work  is  noise  reduction.   To  illustrate  capabilities,  we 
consider two sets of data:  XPS results obtained on a sparse distribution of AuPt clusters on an 
indium tin oxide substrate [34], shown in Fig. 1, and spectroscopic ellipsometric (SE) data of a 
MoSe2 monolayer at 31 K [35], shown in Fig. 2.  The energy range of the XPS data includes 
the  4f  transitions  of  Pt,  and  are  relatively  noisy  because  only  a  small  amount  of  material  is 
available.    The  SE  data  exhibit  relatively  little  noise,  but  must  be  differentiated  twice  with 
respect to energy to assess the possible presence of a weak structure.  

We consider the XPS data first.  After using the external removal of endpoint discontinuities 
(ERED) [30] procedure to remove endpoint-discontinuity artifacts, their Fourier transform was 
calculated.    The  result  is  shown  in  Fig.  3.    This  behavior  is  characteristic  of  noisy  spectra 
containing multiple structures.  The low-order coefficients are relatively noise-free and exhibit 
interference from the different peaks.  The coefficients saturate above the white-noise cutoff, 
here 
.  The low-order 
coefficients  are  followed  exactly,  and  the  trend  that  is  established  by  these  coefficients  is 
followed to the limit imposed by the accuracy of the calculations.  In Fig. 1 the reconstructed 
spectrum is superposed on the original and is essentially noise-free.

In the MoSe2 case, the data are relatively clean, but as shown in Fig. 4, the second derivative 
exhibits  too  much  noise  to  allow  meaningful  conclusions  to  be  drawn.    Figure  5  shows  the 
associated Fourier coefficients, along with the extrapolation calculated assuming a cutoff index

Being generated from analytic reconstructed spectra, in principle these Fourier coefficients 
can  be  extended  as  far  as  desired.   This  opens  the  possibility  of  self-deconvolution  without 
apodization.  Self-deconvolution was first studied by Kauppinen et al. [36] with the objective 
of  minimizing  apodization  effects.    We  have  found  an  analogous  approach  to  be  useful  in 
analyzing spectra with Gaussian features, whose parabolic decrease with coefficient index n is

proceed.  Once noise has been removed to the extent possible, the curvature can be restored and 
the  filtered  lineshape  recovered.    These  and  other  topics  will  be  discussed  in  a  subsequent 
publication. 

6.  Conclusions 

While the Burg and prediction -error formulations can both lead to the correct M-E solution, 
this  aspect  has  been  consistently  overlooked.    In  the  present  work  we  obtain  this  solution, 
discuss  its  main  characteristics,  and  apply  it  to  different  situations  to  demonstrate  its 
effectiveness in removing noise.  The solution for the single Lorentzian is exact, offering insight

lineshapes are reconstructed. 

Returning to our  main purpose, the model-independent M-E method of projecting trends 
established in low-order coefficients into the white-noise region eliminates Gibbs oscillations, 
the major remaining problem with high-performance linear filters.  By retaining the low-index 
coefficients exactly, the M-E process equals the high-performance filters in this regard.  The 
results are therefore quantitatively superior to those that can be obtained with any linear filter, 
with residual noise contributions at an absolute minimum.
