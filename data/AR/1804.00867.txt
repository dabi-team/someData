ABSTRACT

In this paper, we analyzed a failed and a successful eruption that initiated from the same polarity
inversion line within NOAA AR 11387 on December 25, 2011. They both started from a reconnection
between sheared arcades, having distinct pre-eruption conditions and eruption details: before the
failed one, the magnetic ﬁelds of the core region had a weaker non-potentiality; the external ﬁelds had
a similar critical height for torus instability, a similar local torus-stable region, but a larger magnetic
ﬂux ratio (of low corona and near-surface region) as compared to the successful one. During the failed
eruption, a smaller Lorentz force impulse was exerted on the outward ejecta; the ejecta had a much
slower rising speed. Factors that might lead to the initiation of the failed eruption are identiﬁed: 1) a
weaker non-potentiality of the core region, and a smaller Lorentz force impulse gave the ejecta a small
momentum; 2) the large ﬂux ratio, and the local torus-stable region in the corona provided strong
conﬁnements that made the erupting structure regain an equilibrium state.

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CME), as the most energetic phenomena in the solar atmosphere, are
suggested to be diﬀerent manifestations of a same magnetic explosive process when associated (e.g., Harrison 1995;

Lin & Forbes 2000). Their association rate generally increases with the intensities and the durations of the ﬂares. For
example, in a survey that covers ﬂares during 1995 - 2005, an association rate of 40%, 60%, 89% in GOES C5.7-, M3.2-,
X3-class ﬂares, of 100% in ﬂares of a duration > 180 minutes can be found (Yashiro et al. 2006). However, exceptions
like successive X-class ﬂares without accompanied CMEs do exist (e.g., Wang & Zhang 2007; Thalmann et al. 2015;
Sun et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2016a).

Flares accompanied by CMEs are termed as “eruptive” ﬂares, while those without are termed as “conﬁned” ﬂares.
Some conﬁned ﬂares which show a sign of ejecta that failed to fully erupt, are called “failed/conﬁned eruptions”(e.g.,
Ji et al. 2003; Alexander et al. 2006). It should be noted that sometimes the observable ejecta may even appear in the
inner region of the ﬁeld of view (FOV) of coronagraphs, being a “CME” literally, but failed to propagate to a large
distance in the corona. This kind of eruptions may not be magnetically driven, or may at least be diﬀerent from the
ﬂux rope-related CMEs, therefore they are also deﬁned as failed eruptions (Vourlidas et al. 2010, 2013).

Successful eruptions, i.e., CMEs propagating into interplanetary space, may cause strong geomagnetic distur-
bances. Hence, it is important for space weather forecasting to successfully identify the diﬀerence between explo-
sive phenomena with and without successfully escaped ejecta. Extensive research on the subject of “conﬁned” and
“eruptive” ﬂares, as well “failed/conﬁned” and “successful” eruptions, has been done by e.g., T¨or¨ok & Kliem (2005);
Wang & Zhang (2007); Cheng et al. (2011); Sun et al. (2015).

In most models, an eruption is usually driven by a core structure in form of a magnetic ﬂux rope (e.g., Amari et al.
1999, 2000; Roussev et al. 2003; T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005), irrespective of the formation time (prior to or during the
eruption) of the ﬂux rope. The core structure can be tracked if some coupled plasma structures, e.g., sigmoid,
ﬁlament, prominence, and hot channel, are observable (e.g., Canﬁeld et al. 1999; Schmieder et al. 2013; Zhang et al.
2012). Both theoretical and observational work conﬁrm that helical kink instability is one of the onset mechanisms
for eruptions, that will occur when the twist of the magnetic ﬁeld lines exceed a critical value (e.g., T¨or¨ok & Kliem
2005; Guo et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2012); torus instability is another important mechanism for full eruptions, which
will occur when the external ﬁelds decrease fast enough (e.g., Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Fan 2010). Accordingly, studies
on the magnetic conditions in active regions (ARs) mainly focus on two aspects. One is the non-potentiality of the
core magnetic ﬁelds, such as twist number, electric current, magnetic free energy, and magnetic helicity, etc. (e.g.,
Falconer et al. 2002, 2006; Nindos & Andrews 2004; Sun et al. 2015). The other is the conﬁnement of the external
magnetic ﬁelds, measured by the decay of the magnetic ﬁelds with increasing height, i.e., decay index (T¨or¨ok & Kliem
2005), or a ratio of magnetic ﬂuxes at diﬀerent heights (Wang & Zhang 2007). Conﬁned events usually have a weaker
non-potentiality in the core region (e.g., Sun et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2016a), and a stronger conﬁnement in the low corona
than successful eruptions (e.g., Liu 2008). Besides, an eruption position close to the center of the AR (Wang & Zhang
2007; Cheng et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2015), lack of opened or opening overlying magnetic ﬁelds (Ji et al. 2003), or
asymmetry of the magnetic backgrounds (Liu et al. 2009), may play roles in conﬁning the eruptions.

The topology of the magnetic ﬁelds that is involved in the eruption, including that of the core ﬁelds and the
overlying ﬁelds, will determine the eruption details. Therefore, a similar magnetic environment tends to produce
similar eruptions. For example, homologous CMEs/ﬂares, with similar eruptiveness, can occur from the same region
within an AR, e.g., from the same polarity inversion line (PIL) (Zhang & Wang 2002; DeVore & Antiochos 2008;
Chandra et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2017; Vemareddy 2017). PILs are the boundaries of adjacent ﬂux
concentrations with inversed polarities. Core structures of the eruptions, i.e., ﬂux ropes or sheared arcades, usually
reside above the PILs. The same source PIL naturally hints a similar magnetic environment, but sometimes does not
guarantee activities with similar eruptiveness. For example, Shen et al. (2011) studied a series of ﬁlament eruptions
from the same source region, of which only one eruption successfully escaped the Sun. They found that the ﬁeld
strength at the low corona, decay index and asymmetry properties of the extrapolated overlying ﬁelds for the failed
and successful eruptions had no signiﬁcant diﬀerence, and argued that besides the conﬁnement, the energy released in
the low corona may also be crucial for an eruption to fully erupt. Hence, further comparative studies are needed.

In this paper, from the view of failed/successful eruptions, we present a comparative study between two eruptions
that initiated from the same PIL within NOAA AR 11387. The ﬁrst one was a failed eruption associated with a C8.4-
class GOES soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂare (2011-12-25T11:20 UT), the second one was a successful eruption that escaped the
Sun and evolved into a CME, associated with a M4.0-class ﬂare (2011-12-25T18:11 UT). We refer to the ﬁrst, i.e., the
failed (second, successful) one and its corresponding ﬂare as eruption1 and ﬂare1 (eruption2 and ﬂare2) hereinafter.
By performing a combined analysis, including eruption details and the evolution of the magnetic conditions based on
stereoscopic observations, we try to discover the physical explanation for events that initiated from a possibly similar
magnetic environment but with diﬀerent eruptiveness. The paper is organized as follows: Data and methods are
introduced in Section 2. Results are presented in Section 3. Summary and discussion are given in Section 4.

2. DATA AND METHODS

The two eruptions both occurred near the coordinates S20W20 (see Table 1 for details ), and are well observed
by SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory, Pesnell et al. 2012). STEREO-A (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory-
Ahead, Kaiser et al. 2008) had a separation angle of 107◦ from SDO, giving an additional limb-view for the eruptions.
We study the on-disk ﬂaring evolution, using SDO/AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, Lemen et al. 2012) data,
that observes in seven EUV passbands and three UV passbands with a cadence up to 12 s and and a resolution
of 0.6 arcsecs. We analyze the rising motion of the eruptions, using data from EUVI (Extreme Ultraviolet Imager,
Wuelser et al. 2004), COR1 and COR2 (Inner and Outer Coronagraphs, Thompson et al. 2003), that are all comprised
in SECCHI (Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation, Howard et al. 2008) on board STEREO-A.
We further apply a CME detection tool (Bein et al. 2011, 2012) to track the eruption structure in EUVI and COR1,
COR2 images, by which its kinematics is obtained using a spline ﬁt method.

Besides the above data sets, photospheric vector magnetograms from SDO/HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager, Hoeksema et al. 2014) are used to analyze the eruption-related magnetic conditions. We take a subset of
SHARPs (Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches, Bobra et al. 2014) data products that automatically track an
AR (or AR clusters). SHARPs are remapped from CCD coordinates into a heliographic coordinates with cylindrical
equal area (CEA), with a resolution of 0.36 Mm per pixel and a time cadence of 720 s. Using SHARP data, we are
able to calculate photospheric parameters, e.g., magnetic ﬂux Φ, shear angle S, current density Jz, current helicity
hc, energy density ρ, etc., in the whole AR or in a sub-region within the AR (cf. the detailed calculation formulas in
Table 1).

Using DAVE4VM (Diﬀerential Aﬃne Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms, Schuck 2008) method to a
time series of SHARP vector magnetograms, we can get the photospheric plasma velocity (V ). By subtracting the
ﬁeld-aligned plasma ﬂow, (V · B)B/B2, from V , the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁelds, denoted by V⊥,
can be obtained. Accordingly, the relative magnetic helicity ﬂux through the photosphere can be calculated by:

dH
dt (cid:12)
S
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

= 2

(Ap · Bt)V⊥ndS − 2

(Ap · V⊥t)BndS

(1)

where Ap refers to the vector potential of the potential magnetic ﬁelds which have the same vertical component as the
photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds. Bt (Bn) refers to the tangential (vertical) component of the ﬁelds, and V⊥t (V⊥n)
refers to the tangential (vertical) component of V⊥. The left term of the above equation denotes the helicity injection
rate contributed by the emergence of the twisted ﬂux tube, while the right term refers to the helicity injection rate
due to the shear motion on the photosphere (e.g., Berger 1984; Liu & Schuck 2012; Liu et al. 2014).

No direct observation of coronal magnetic ﬁelds is available. Thus, the three dimensional (3-D) coronal magnetic
ﬁelds are reconstructed by a nonlinear force free ﬁelds (NLFFF) (Wiegelmann 2004; Wiegelmann et al. 2006, 2012)
and a potential ﬁelds (PF) extrapolation method (e.g., Sakurai 1989), using the photospheric vector magnetograms as
boundaries. Magnetic free energy can therefore be calculated by subtracting the magnetic potential energy from the
total magnetic energy, i.e., with

ZV
in which BN refers to the NLFFFs and BP refers to the PFs, dV denotes the elementary volume. The decay index
that measures the decrease of the external magnetic ﬁelds with increasing height can be calculated by

(3)

where h refers to the height, Bex is the horizontal component of the external potential magnetic ﬁelds, since PFs play
the major role in conﬁning the eruption in torus instability theory (T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005). A ratio of the unsigned
magnetic ﬂuxes in the low corona (h ≈ 42 Mm) and in the near-surface region (h ≈ 2 Mm), which additionally
measures the conﬁnement of the overlying ﬁelds to the core region (Wang & Zhang 2007; Sun et al. 2015), can be
calculated by Φ (42)/Φ (2). 42 Mm is found to be a typical height for eruption onset (Liu 2008). Φ (h) is calculated
|Bz (h)|dA in a plane with a height of h Mm, where Bz refers to the vertical component of the magnetic ﬁelds
by
and dA to the elementary area of the plane.

To study the magnetic parameters in the region that is most largely involved in the ﬂare, a “ﬂaring PIL” (FPIL)
is obtained following a method described in Sun et al. (2015): the PIL pixels are ﬁrstly located in a Bz map, and then
dilated with a circular kernel (r ≈ 3 Mm); the ﬂaring pixels are ﬁrstly located in an AIA 1600˚A map near the peak

P

time of the ﬂare, with a threshold of Am + 3 × Ad, where Am and Ad are the mean value and the standard deviation
of the 1600 ˚A image, and then dilated with the kernel; ﬁnally, the FPIL is determined as the intersection between the
dilated PIL pixels and the ﬂaring pixels. Within the region, the parameters in Table 1 are calculated. Besides, the
change of the vertical Lorentz force during the eruption, whose temporal integral can represent the force impulse that
provides the outward ejecta’s momentum, is calculated by:

δFz,upward =

dA(δB2

h − δB2
z )

where Bz (Bh) refers to the vertical (horizontal) component of the magnetic ﬁelds, and dA refers to the elementary
area (Fisher et al. 2012; Petrie 2012, 2013; Wang & Liu 2015).

With the data and method introduced above, we perform the analyzes.

3. RESULTS

Figure 1 displays the magnetic source region and the accompanied ﬂares of the two eruptions. The source AR had
a multipolar conﬁguration (as seen in Figure 1 (a)). Both eruptions were initiated from the same PIL (yellow line in
Figure 1 (a)), which was formed by two closely placed ﬂux concentrations with opposite polarities (enclosed in white
boxes in Figure 1 (a),(c),(e)). The two ﬂares had diﬀerent magnitude, C8.4-class for ﬂare1 and M4.0-class for ﬂare2,
respectively (Figure 1 (b),(d)), but almost same durations (9 and 11 minutes). See more ﬂaring details in Table 1.
They all produced ﬂare ribbons along the source PIL (as seen in Figure 1 (c),(e)). For each eruption, we analyze their
eruption details, pre-eruption magnetic conditions and eruption-related changes.

3.1. Eruption Details

Figure 2 shows the eruption process of the failed eruption (eruption1) observed by AIA (panels (a)-(d)), EUVI
A (panels (e)-(g)) and COR1 A (panel (h)). Before the onset of the ﬂare, two sets of sheared arcades (marked by
arrows SA1 and SA2 in Figure 2(a)) were discernible in multiple wavelengths. The two sets of sheared arcades both
lay above the source PIL. See more supporting evidence from the extrapolated magnetic ﬁelds in Section 3.3. The
locations of the northern footpoints of the two sets of arcades (marked by FP1, FP2 in Figure 2, respectively) were
very close. Flaring between the two sets of sheared arcades can be observed. After the onset of the ﬂare, mixture and
exchange between the northern footpoints of SA1 and SA2 can be identiﬁed (see Figure 2 (b)). A structure connecting
the northern footpoint of SA1 (FP1 in Figure 2 (a),(b)) and the southern footpoint of SA2 (FP2′′ in Figure 2(a),(b))
formed and acted as the core structure of the eruption (see Figure 2 (c),(d)). The structure showed a clear writhing
motion, which converted the twist of the plasma coupled ﬁeld lines into the writhe of the axis of the ﬂux-rope like
core structure, then grew into a γ shape in AIA observation (outlined by the white dotted line in Figure 2(d)), faded
gradually, and ﬁnally became invisible. Accompanied plasma drainage downward to the solar disk can be observed.
For more details see the online animation. The core structure showed an upward motion as observed by EUVI A with
a limb view (Figure 2 (e)-(g)) and ﬁnally halted at around 0.24 Rsun, and became invisible gradually. Meanwhile,
extremely faint outﬂow can be observed in the inner boundary of the FOV of COR1 A (Figure 2(h)), which decelerated
and diﬀused soon following the motion of the failed erupted core structure. Concluding, this can not be deﬁned as a
successful CME as introduced in Section 1.

The kinematical evolution of the core structure is shown in Figure 3 (red curve), and is obtained by the CME
detection tool introduced in Section 2. The core structure was ﬁrstly observed by EUVI A 195˚A at a height of ∼ 0.01
Rsun above the solar surface, then slowly rose and stopped at the highest position around 0.24 Rsun. Accordingly, the
velocity of the core structure peaked at the core’s ﬁrst appearance, then decreased gradually to 0. The inner corona
outﬂow that appeared in COR1 A was extremely faint, diﬀuse without coherent shape or clear front, leading to a large
uncertainty of its detection. Thus, its kinematics is not obtained.

In summary, the failed eruption was driven by a ﬂux rope-like structure that may form during the ﬂare. The core

structure rose slowly and ﬁnally halted/disappeared at around 0.24 Rsun.

Figure 4 shows the eruption process of the successful eruption (eruption2) observed by AIA (panels (a)-(d)), EUVI
A (panels (e)-(f)), COR1 A (panel (g)) and COR2 A (panel (h)). Before the onset of the ﬂare, a sigmoid structure can
be observed in multiple wavelengths of AIA, which is shown in 94 ˚A here (Figure 4 (a)). Two sets of sheared arcades
(marked by SA1 and SA2 in Figure 4 (a)) can be identiﬁed. See more supporting evidence from the extrapolated
magnetic ﬁelds in Section 3.3. The corresponding footpoints of the two sets of the sheared arcades (FP1 and FP1′′
for SA1, FP2 and FP2′′ for SA2 in Figure 4 (b)) brightened after the ﬂare onset. The intensity of the ﬂaring kept
increasing (Figure 4 (c)), the sheared arcades or any structure that formed during the eruption can not be identiﬁed
later. After the eruption, post-eruption loops can be observed (Figure 4 (d)). See more details in the online animation.

5

The kinematics of the CME in eruption2 is also checked and shown in Figure 3 (in blue). The CME was ﬁrstly
captured by EUVI A at a height around 0.1 Rsun, with a peak velocity of 1041 km/s, and then expanded fastly and
entered the FOV of COR1 A before the ﬂare ended. The velocity of the CME decreased as it propagated, and ﬁnally
kept at a constant speed around 500 km/s.

In summary, the successful eruption released a CME rapidly. There may also be a reconnection between the two
sets of sheared arcades during the eruption, similar as the process in the failed eruption, that needs further study
based on coronal magnetic ﬁelds reconstruction (see Section 3.3).

3.2. Pre-eruption Condition
LONG-DURATION EVOLUTION OF THE AR

In this section, we check the evolution of the source AR, NOAA AR 11387 in six hours before each eruption.
Figure 5 displays the snapshots of the evolving photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds (Figure 5 (a)-(c) for eruption1,
(e)-(g) for eruption2) and six hours-averaged velocities V⊥ (Figure 5 (d) for eruption1, (h) for eruption2). Before both
eruptions, clear magnetic ﬂux emergence can be observed in the Bz magnetograms. For eruption1, the AR already
had a multipolar conﬁguration six hours before its onset (Figure 5(a)). The source polarity pairs are highlighted in
Figure 5 (white boxes and top right insets.) Within the region, the positive polarity (white patch) appeared and grew
fastly during the six hours, accompanied by a westward movement that can be distinguished from its displacement.
Meanwhile, the negative polarity (black patch) underwent a signiﬁcant morphological change. The polarity pair was
approaching each other. The Bh component of the magnetic ﬁelds (red and blue arrows in Figure 5 (a),(b),(c)) grew
with the emergence of the polarities. The tangential component (V⊥t, orange arrows in Figure 5(d)) of the six hours-
averaged velocities clearly indicate westward motion, while the vertical velocities (V⊥n, cyan contours in Figure 5(d))
indicate signiﬁcant upﬂow at the east boundary of the positive polarity. The positive polarity moved westward faster
than the negative one, indicating a net converging motion toward the PIL (yellow lines in Figure 5 (c) and (d)) (see
online animation).

Before eruption2, ﬂux emergence, especially for the positive ﬂux, still existed in the source polarity pairs (Fig-
ure 5(e)-(g)). Shortly before eruption2 (Figure 5(g)), the polarities were much closer to each other than the ones
at the time instance before eruption1 (Figure 5(c)); and Bh ran more parallel to the PIL. The six hours-averaged
tangential velocities also indicate a westward movement (orange arrows in Figure 5(h)), while the vertical velocities
(cyan contours in Figure 5(h)) indicate a large extent upﬂow at the east boundary of the positive polarity, which was
smaller compared to the upﬂow before eruption1 (Figure 5(d)). The positive polarity had a faster westward movement
and brought the two polarities closer. See online animation for the evolution of the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds
of the AR.

The temporal evolution of some key parameters that characterize the properties of the entire AR are displayed in
Figure 6. The total, positive, negative magnetic ﬂux (black, orange, cyan curves in Figure 6 (a)) increased with time,
conﬁrming the ﬂux emergence as observed in the magnetogram snapshots (Figure 5). The ﬂux change rate (dotted
black curve in Figure 6 (a)) evolved, showing a larger value around 5 × 1020 Mx/h before ﬂare1 than the value around
4.2×1020 Mx/h before ﬂare2. The helicity ﬂux, i.e., the helicity injection rate calculated from Equation 1, including the
total, emergence term and shear term are shown in Figure 6 (b). The shear term (cyan curve in Figure 6(b)) played a
dominant role for the helicity injection. Before eruption1, the shear term had a mean value of 0.69 ± 0.11 × 1037 Mx2/s,
while the emergence term had a mean value of 0.43 ± 0.07 × 1037 Mx2/s. Before eruption2, the shear term had a
sudden increase after 14:00 UT but decreased again after 17:00 UT, with a peak value reaching 1.48 × 1037 Mx2/s.
Meanwhile, the emergence term had a mean value of 0.50±0.12×1037 Mx2/s before 16:00 UT, comparable to the mean
value before eruption1, and then showed a trend of decrease. Free magnetic energy is also calculated with Equation 2
based on the reconstructed coronal magnetic ﬁelds, shown in Figure 6(c). The magnetic free energy increased before
both eruptions. More free energy was accumulated during the six hours before eruption2 (2.35 × 1031 erg) than before
eruption1 (1.40 × 1031 erg).

In summary, ﬂux emergence, helicity injection and free energy accumulation existed in the AR before both

eruptions. The latter two accumulated more remarkably before the successful eruption.

MAGNETIC CONDITIONS PRIOR TO THE ERUPTION ONSETS

The magnetograms have a time cadence of 12 minutes. To explore the static, pre-eruption magnetic conditions,
we choose the ones nearest and prior to the ﬂare onsets, resulting a magnetogram with 10 minutes before ﬂare1,
and the other with 1 minute before ﬂare2. On the photosphere, an FPIL mask (outlined by dotted green lines in
Figure 7 (a),(c)), a region that involves the source PIL and the ﬂaring area, is obtained based on the combination of

6

the magnetograms and the images in AIA/1600˚A for each eruption (see method details in Section 2). We refer FPIL1
(FPIL2) as the mask for eruption1 (eruption2). Parameters in the FPIL masks are calculated and shown in Table 1.
In general, FPIL2 had a larger size than FPIL1, with an unsigned magnetic ﬂux (Φ) of 8.17 × 1020 Mx, which was
three times larger than for FPIL1 (2.71 × 1020 Mx). The mean value of the strength of the magnetic ﬁelds (B) in
FPIL2 (814 G), which should not be aﬀected by the mask size, was also larger than in FPIL1 (479 G). The parameters
that measure the non-potentiality of the region all had larger values in FPIL2 than in FPIL1. See details in Table 1
(covering also parameters that measure the conﬁnement of the external potential ﬁelds). The two events had similar
critical heights (the heights where n reach the critical value, 1.5, for torus instability) below 15 Mm. The ratio of
magnetic ﬂuxes between 42 Mm and 2 Mm for eruption2 (0.04) was lower than for eruption1 (0.08). The free energy
for eruption2 in the total computing volume (4.71 × 1031 erg) was larger than for eruption1 (2.27 × 1031 erg).

For clariﬁcation, Figure 7 displays the pre-eruption free energy map (Figure 7(a),(c)) of the core region and
the distribution of Bh and decay index above the FPIL (Figure 7(b),(d)). The free energy is integrated from the
photosphere to 42 Mm. For both eruptions, the free energy had clear concentrations that covered the majority of
the FPIL. The intensity, and the size of the free energy concentration for eruption2 was larger than for eruption1.
Meanwhile, the distributions of the decay index above the FPIL (orange curves in Figure 7(b),(d)) showed similar
variation trend of a “saddle-like” proﬁle: for eruption1, n reached the critical value of 1.5 at around 13.1 Mm, kept
increasing and peaked at around 27 Mm with a value of 2, then decreased and dropped in a local torus-stable region
within [40, 76] Mm, afterwards kept increasing with values larger than 1.5; for eruption2, a similar variation trend was
found, though with slightly lower heights. n reached the critical height at around 10.2 Mm, peaked at 21 Mm, and
fell into the local torus-stable region within heights of [36, 67] Mm. For the median value of Bh above the FPIL (black
curves in Figure 7(b),(d)), the two distributions had a similar variation trend except larger values near the photosphere
for eruption2.

For each eruption, the pre-eruption critical height (long dashed horizontal line in Figure 3 (a)) and torus-stable
region (enclosed in the upper two short dashed horizontal lines in Figure 3 (a)) are marked in Figure 3 for comparison.
The core structure of the failed eruption had an initial height of ∼ 0.01 Rsun (≈ 7 Mm). It rose rapidly in the lower
torus-unstable region, and slowed down to a large extent after it passed the torus-stable region. The CME in the
successful eruption rose much faster than the failed one, and passed the torus-stable region more quickly.

In summary, before the eruption onset, the core region of the successful eruption displayed larger non-potentiality
than the failed one. Their decay index distributions had a similar variation trend like a “saddle”, in which a local
torus-stable region was enclosed by two torus-unstable regions. The torus-stable region may play a role in conﬁning
the failed eruption.

3.3. Eruption-related Change

A ﬂux rope-locating method, using the combination of the twist number and the squashing factor Q calculated
from the reconstructed 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁelds (Liu et al. 2016b), is performed to ﬁnd the possible pre-existing
ﬂux rope. However, no coherent pre-existing ﬂux rope can be located before both eruptions. Therefore the result
is not presented here. We then checked the detailed conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁelds above the source PIL in
the extrapolated coronal ﬁelds before and after the eruptions. For eruption1, the result is shown in Figure 8 (panels
(a),(b)). Before the eruption, two sets of sheared ﬁeld lines (SA1 and SA2 in Figure 8 (a)) that corresponded well with
the sheared arcades observed by AIA (see background of Figure 8 (a), or SA1 and SA2 in Figure 2 (a)) were found.
Note, the coronal magnetic ﬁelds are reconstructed using the HMI SHARP cutout magnetograms as photospheric
boundaries, which limits the extrapolation cube region so that sometimes the extrapolated ﬁeld lines may go in and
out of the boundary, as the ﬁeld lines of SA2 in Figure 8 (a) showed: their southern part was out of the extrapolation
box. However, the northern part (left in the box) coincided well with the corresponding arcades observed by AIA (SA2
in Figure 2(a)). The extrapolated ﬁelds also met the divergence-free and force-free condition required by the NLFFF
method (see details in APPENDIX A). Thus, we still take the result. After eruption1, the two sets of the sheared
ﬁeld lines can not be identiﬁed, neither in the AIA observation (background of Figure 8(b)) nor in the reconstructed
magnetic ﬁelds. On the contrary, near-potential loops can be identiﬁed in both, observation and the model corona
(cyan ﬁeld lines marked as PFL in Figure 8(b)). Combined with the evolution of the eruption, we argue that a
reconnection between the two sets of the sheared arcades that formed the eruption core, may have happened.

Besides checking the topology change, we also checked the change of the photospheric Bh as shown in Figure 8(c).
The map is projected into CCD coordinates to be compared with Figure 8 (a), (b). A clear enhancement of Bh was
discernible in the FPIL region (outlined by a black curve in Figure 8(c)). The change of the Lorentz force, calculated by

7

Equation 4, gave a value of 0.11 × 1022 dyn. Meanwhile, the magnetic free energy showed a decrease of 0.47 × 1031 erg
(see Table 1).

For eruption2, similar changes are derived and shown in Figure 9. Before the eruption, two sets of sheared ﬁeld
lines (SA1 and SA2 in Figure 9 (a)) above the PIL can be identiﬁed, which corresponded well with the position of the
sheared arcades observed by AIA (backgrounds in Figure 9 (a) and SA1, SA2 in Figure 4 (a)). After eruption2, the
two sets of the sheared ﬁeld lines were not discernible anymore, and near-potential loops were found above the source
PIL (exemplary loops are shown as PFL in Figure 9 (b)). Besides the topology change of the ﬁelds, the enhancement
of the photospheric Bh in the FPIL can also be recognized (Figure 9 (c)). The change of the Lorentz force had a value
of 1.64 × 1022 dyne, which was an order of magnitude larger than the value of the force change in eruption1. The
magnetic free energy also showed a larger decrease of 0.83 × 1031 erg (shown in Table 1).

In summary, the derived topology changes in the reconstructed magnetic ﬁelds support that for both eruptions, a
reconnection between the sheared arcades above the source PIL may have happened. Compared to the failed eruption,
the successful eruption revealed a larger change in the Lorentz force and a stronger decrease in the magnetic free
energy.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

4.1. Summary

In this work, we perfomed a detailed comparative study between a failed and a successful eruption that initi-
ated from the same PIL within NOAA AR 11387 from perspectives of their eruption details, pre-eruption magnetic
conditions, and the eruption-related changes by stereoscopic observation from SDO and STEREO-A. The results are
summarized as follows:

1. For the failed eruption (eruption1), two sets of sheared arcades above the source PIL can be identiﬁed from AIA
observations before the eruption. The sheared arcades were likely to reconnect during the ﬂare, and led to the
formation of a ﬂux rope-like core structure that drove the outward eruption. The structure rose slowly with
writhing motion and mass drainage, and ﬁnally stopped, became gradually invisible afterwards. The process ﬁts
into a scenario of a failed eruption of a helical kinked ﬂux rope (e.g., Fan 2005; T¨or¨ok et al. 2010; Guo et al.
2010; Hassanin & Kliem 2016). The core structure had a peak velocity of 178 km/s, and ceased at a height
around 0.24 Rsun.

For the successful eruption (eruption2), two sets of sheared arcades above the PIL were also identiﬁed before
its onset. Their corresponding footpoints brightened during the ﬂare, indicating a reconnection between them.
The eruption rapidly evolved into a fast CME (with a peak velocity of 1041 km/s) that propagated into the
heliosphere.

2. Before both eruptions, continuous ﬂux emergence existed in the source AR. For the source polarity pair, the
positive one displayed a faster westward motion than the negative one, resulting in a net convergence toward the
PIL. Due to continuous ﬂux emergence and shear motion on the photosphere, magnetic helicity was injected,
with a dominating shear term. A larger quantity of magnetic free energy and magnetic helicity was accumulated
before the successful eruption.

Before the onset of the eruptions, the core region, i.e., the source FPIL of the successful eruption displayed a
larger non-potentiality than the failed eruption. For example, before the successful eruption, more magnetic free
energy resided above the FPIL, and larger values were derived for the mean current density, current helicity,
and the shear angle that measures the core region’s non-potentiality. The decay index distributions showed no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence, although the critical height for the successful erupion was slightly lower (around 3 Mm)
than for the failed eruption. The ratio of magnetic ﬂuxes at 42 Mm and 2 Mm (in the FPIL mask) was smaller
before the successful eruption, indicating a relatively weaker conﬁnement.

3. Before the failed eruption, two sets of sheared ﬁeld lines that corresponded well with the observed sheared
arcades, can be identiﬁed in the coronal magnetic ﬁelds extrapolated by the NLFFF method. After the eruption,
the sheared ﬁeld lines disappeared, while near-potential loops were identiﬁed above the PIL. Combined with the
observed eruption process, we conjecture that a reconnection between the sheared arcades may have occurred.
A similar topology change was found during the successful eruption.

Signiﬁcant enhancements of Bh were found in the FPILs after both eruptions, while the value of the Lorentz force
change during the successful eruption was an order of magnitude larger than for the failed eruption. Decreases

8

of magnetic free energy were also found after both eruptions, although the magnitude for the successful eruption
was larger than for the failed one.

4.2. Discussion

The associated ﬂares of the two eruptions had diﬀerent intensities, C8.4-class and M4.0-class for the failed and the
successful one. In general, the CME association rate increases when ﬂare intensity increases, but the rate values for
C8.4-class and M4.0-class are 45% and 65%, respectively, (see ﬁgure 1 in Yashiro et al. 2006), which are comparable.
The event choice here is therefore adequate. During the failed eruption, an extremely faint corona outﬂow, without
coherent shape or clear front, appeared in the FOV of COR1, soon diﬀused and failed to travel to a distance larger than
1 Rsun. Observation of COR2 and LASCO (Brueckner et al. 1995) conﬁrmed the absence of a successful CME. This
kind of literal “coronal mass ejections” that appeared in the inner corona but failed to propagate to a large distance,
are deﬁned as “pseudo-” or “failed-” CMEs in Vourlidas et al. (2010, 2013), which are thought to be diﬀerent from
the ﬂux-rope related CMEs, as they may not be magnetically driven. Therefore, we argue that deﬁning eruption1 as
a failed eruption is reasonable. The physical nature of this kind of “pseudo-” CME is worth a further study.

Enhancement of Bh, which was observed during both eruptions, consists with the “magnetic implosion” scenario,
in which the enhanced Bh is thought to be attributed to the contraction of the ﬁeld loops due to the decrease of the
magnetic pressure resulted by the eruption (e.g., Hudson 2000; Wang & Liu 2010; Liu et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012a).
When no eruption happens, the solar atmosphere is in a quasi-static, i.e., roughly force-free state. The state does not
stand during the eruption. Using the change of the magnetic ﬁelds during the eruption, the change of the upward
Lorentz force exerted on the ejecta can be calculated by Equation 4, of which the temporal integral will represent
the Lorentz force impulse. A larger impulse results in a larger momentum of the outward ejecta, indicating a faster
velocity if the mass of the ejecta is comparable (Equation 14 in Fisher et al. 2012). For the above two eruptions,
although precise times during which the Lorentz force acting on the ejecta can not be obtained, their associated ﬂares
have comparable durations, thus the Lorentz force impulses may be reﬂected directly by the changes of the force.
During the successful eruption, an order of magnitude larger Lorentz force change was found, consisted with the result
of Sun et al. (2015), in which the Lorentz force change in an X3.1-class conﬁned ﬂare from NOAA AR 12192 was
smaller than in other eruptive ﬂares. Furthermore, the successful eruption had a larger peak velocity in the low corona
than the failed eruption. We therefore argue that a large Lorentz force impulse, recorded by the Lorentz force change,
may be important for a successful eruption, which will give the medium weight ejecta a large initial velocity, make it
quickly enter the region with weak conﬁnement and escape the Sun. The Lorentz force change, as a easily computed
parameter, has been conﬁrmed by Wang et al. (2012b) to be linearly correlated to the magnitude of the ﬂares. Its
correlation to the eruptiveness of the ﬂares is worth a further statistical study.

It should be noted that the Lorentz force change (or force impulse) may not be a suﬃciently independent parameter.
J × B dV , a non-zero force ﬁrstly requires the
Considering the original form of the equation for Lorentz force: F =
existence of current in the volume, which is related to the non-potentiality of the magnetic ﬁelds; it secondly requires
the current density to have a component perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld lines, i.e., is additionally inﬂuenced by
the ﬁelds conﬁguration. Besides, the force change can only be obtained after the eruption, that may not be practical
to pre-evaluate the potential of a source region for producing CMEs. However, it still reﬂects the property of the
force acting on the ejecta during the eruption, that may also be important as the pre-eruption conditions of the source
region in determining the ﬁnal state of the ejecta.

V

Before both eruptions, the decay index distribution displayed a “saddle-like” proﬁle, exhibiting a local torus-
stable (n < 1.5) region higher than the critical height, enclosed by two torus-unstable domains. This kind of proﬁle
is found to be exclusive in ARs with multipolar conﬁguration, and may provide extra conﬁnement when the erupting
core structure enters this torus-stable region without a well-developed disturbance (Wang et al. 2017). In our failed
eruption, the erupting core reached a height around 0.24 Rsun, which was higher than the critical height or the local
torus-stable region. It rose quickly in the lower torus-unstable region, but slowed down largely after passing through
the torus-stable region. It exhibited a writhing motion that converted the twist to the writhe of the structure axis,
which is a typical behavior in the course of helical kink instability, suggesting a ﬂux rope conﬁguration of itself, and
a possible “self-consistent” reformation. It may have regained an equilibrium state due to the stronger conﬁnement
in the torus-stable region, rose more slowly and ﬁnally halted. For the successful eruption, the erupting structure
had larger energy/initial velocity to pass through the torus-stable region rapidly, and was kept in a non-equilibrium
state with enough disturbance to erupt out. The local torus-stable region in our case, which is also found in some
other failed eruptions (e.g., Guo et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2017), may play an important role in conﬁning the eruption,
especially those ones with small initial momentum. The result suggests that the role of the decay index in determining

a full eruption should be considered by its entire distribution, rather than a single critical height.

Before both eruptions, no pre-existing coherent ﬂux rope can be found. However, sheared arcades were found
above the PIL, which may have reconnected and initiated the eruptions. This is consistent with the result in Liu et al.
(2016a) who concluded that pre-existing ﬂux ropes or sheared structures are necessary conditions for successful CMEs,
although not suﬃcient ones.

In summary, we analyzed two eruptions initiated from the same PIL, one with a failed erupted core and a faint
inner corona outﬂow that is deﬁned as a failed eruption, one with a fully evolved CME that is deﬁned as a successful
eruption. They both started from reconnection between diﬀerent sets of sheared arcades above the source PIL due to
converging motion, during which the ﬂux ropes may have formed and driven the eruptions. The successful eruption had
a larger velocity than the failed one. Although originated from the same PIL, they had distinct pre-eruption magnetic
conditions: for the successful eruption, the source region underwent a more severe shear motion, accumulated more
helicity and free energy, leading to a core region with a larger non-potentiality before the eruption started; the external
magnetic ﬁelds displayed a similar decay index distribution (a “saddle-like” proﬁle) but smaller ﬂux ratio (between
values in the planes at 42 Mm and 2 Mm) compared to the conditions for the failed eruption. The Lorentz force
change exerted on the outward ejecta over the course of the eruption, which can represent the force impulse, was an
order of magnitude larger than for the failed eruption. We argue that the weaker non-potentiality in the core region,
smaller Lorentz force impulse during the eruption, and the local torus-stable region in the coronal magnetic ﬁelds
are together responsible for the failed eruption: the core structure erupted with a small momentum due to weaker
non-potentiality in its source and a small Lorentz force impulse exerted on it, may regain an equilibrium state due to
the strong conﬁnement in the torus-stable region, and thus failed to fully erupt. The Lorentz force impulse during
the eruption (which may be related to the non-potentiality and the conﬁguration of the source ﬁelds), and the local
torus-stable regions in the corona may play important roles in initiating and conﬁning the eruptions.

Figure 5. Evolution of the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds, and the velocities, of the AR during six hours before each
eruption. (a)-(d) evolution before eruption1. (e)-(f) evolution before eruption2. (a)-(c) maps of Bz before eruption1 in every
three hours. White dotted boxes have the same FOV as the white box in Figure 1(a), enclosing the source magnetic polarity
pairs, and are enlarged and displayed as insets on the right sides, with Bh overplotted. The black (white) contours in the insets
outline the boundaries of the positive (negative) polarity at 300 (−300) G for clarity. Colored background and arrows have the
same meaing as the ones in Figure 1 (a). (d) shows the Bz magnetogram (same as in panel (c)) shortly before the ﬂare, with
six hours-averaged V⊥ calculated by DAVE4VM overplotted. The orange arrows display the horizontal component of V⊥, while
the cyan contours outline the vertical component of V⊥ at [0.05, 0.09] km/s. The yellow lines in (c), (d) mark the PIL before
eruption1. (e)-(h) have the same layouts as (a)-(d) but for eruption2. An online animation, showing the 12 hours evolution of
the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds, is available.

six hours before eruption1 and six hours before eruption2. (a) evolution of magnetic ﬂuxes, black solid line for the total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux, black dotted line for the magnetic ﬂux change rate, orange line for the positive magnetic ﬂux and cyan line for
the absolute value of the negative magnetic ﬂux, which is suited for a direct comparison. The uncertainties of the magnetic ﬂux
calculated from the error data segment from HMI are overplotted on the curves, which are too small to be distinguished. (b)
one hour-averaged helicity ﬂux calculated by Equation 1, black line for the total helicity ﬂux, orange line for the helicity ﬂux
from the emergence term and cyan line for the helicity ﬂux from the shear term. An uncerntaity, of 23% of the helicity ﬂux value
(a value from Liu & Schuck 2012) is overplotted every 5 data points. (c) free magnetic energy calculated in the reconstructed
magnetic ﬁelds by Equation 2. Uncertainties of 20% of the free energy values are overplotted (Thalmann et al. 2008). The
energy data points have a cadence of 720s during the eruption, and 1 hour during other durations. In all panels, red dotted
lines mark the beginning, peaking and ending time of the ﬂare1. Blue dotted lines give same information but for ﬂare2.

APPENDIX

A. QUALITY OF THE NLFFF EXTRAPOLATION

In this study, we reconstruct the coronal magnetic ﬁelds based on a NLFF assumption, which requires the model
ﬁelds to meet the force-free and divergence-free condition. Following Wheatland et al. (2000); Liu et al. (2016b, 2017),
we calculate two parameters: the fractional ﬂux increase (h|fi|i) and the angle between the ﬁelds and the current
density (θ) in the extrapolated volume to check their qualities. The computing equations are:

h|fi|i =

θ = sin

n denotes the number of the cells in the calculation volume, B refers to the magnetic ﬁelds, J denotes the current
density. subscript “i” refers to the ith cell, ∆V and ∆S refer to the volume and the surface area of each cell. See
Figure A1 for the qualities of the model ﬁelds in the context. h|fi|i are all well below 0.007 while θ are all well below
10◦, conﬁrming that the model ﬁelds all meet the force-free and divergence-free condition.
