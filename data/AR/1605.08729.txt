Abstract

A two-phase Cryogenic Avalanche Detector (CRAD) with electroluminescence (EL) gap, operated in argon doped with a minor
(49±7 ppm) admixture of nitrogen, has been studied. The EL gap was optically read out using cryogenic PMTs located on the
perimeter of the gap. We present the results of the measurements of the N2 content, detector sensitivity to X-ray-induced signals,
EL gap yield and electron lifetime in the liquid. The detector sensitivity, at a drift ﬁeld in liquid Ar of 0.6 kV/cm, was measured
to be 9 and 16 photoelectrons recorded at the PMTs per keV of deposited energy at 23 and 88 keV respectively. Such two-phase
detectors, with enhanced sensitivity to the S2 (ionization-induced) signal, are relevant in the ﬁeld of argon detectors for dark matter
search and low energy neutrino detection.

Keywords: Two-phase detectors, Argon doped with nitrogen, Electroluminescence, Dark matter detectors

1. Introduction

The present study was performed in the course of the devel-
opment of two-phase Cryogenic Avalanche Detectors (CRADs)
[1, 2], operated in Ar, for dark matter search [3, 4] and coherent
neutrino-nucleus scattering [5, 6] experiments and their energy
calibration [7, 8, 9, 10].

In two-phase detectors operated in Ar, the S2 signal (in-
duced by the primary ionization in the noble-gas liquid), is de-
tected through the eﬀect of proportional electroluminescence
(or proportional scintillation) in electroluminescence (EL) gap
located directly above the liquid-gas interface [11]. In propor-
tional electroluminescence the energy provided to the electrons
by the electric ﬁeld is almost fully expended in atomic exci-
tations producing Ar∗(3p54s1) and Ar∗(3p54p1) states. These
are followed by the photon emission in the Vacuum Ultraviolet
(VUV), around 128 nm, due to excimer (Ar∗
2) productions in
three-body collisions and their subsequent decays [12, 13, 14],
and by the photon emission in the Near Infrared (NIR), at 690-
850 nm, due to Ar∗(3p54p1) → Ar∗(3p54s1) + hν atomic tran-
sitions [15, 16].

In presence of nitrogen admixture to gaseous argon the
mechanism of proportional electroluminescence is modiﬁed.
Namely, the excimer production (and hence the VUV emission)
can be taken over by that of excited N2 molecules in two-body
collisions followed by their de-excitations in the Near Ultravi-
olet (NUV) [17], through the emission of the so-called Second
Positive System (SPS), at 260-430 nm [18].

It should be remarked that VUV recording is rather ineﬃ-
cient in two-phase detectors in Ar as compared to that of NUV,
due to re-emission and total reﬂection losses in the Wavelength

Shifter (WLS): the losses in light collection eﬃciency may ex-
ceed an order of magnitude [1]. Accordingly, it looks attrac-
tive to dope argon with a small amount of nitrogen, to convert
the VUV into the NUV directly in the EL gap. This idea has
been recently realized by our group in [1]. A high performance
two-phase CRAD has been developed there, with EL gap op-
tically read out using cryogenic PMTs located on the perime-
ter of the gap, and with combined THGEM/GAPD-matrix mul-
tiplier [2, 15, 19] (THGEM is Thick Gas Electron Multiplier
[20]; GAPD is Geiger-mode APD or MPPC or else SiPM [22]).
Such a combined charge/optical readout of two-phase detectors
would result in a higher overall gain at superior spatial resolu-
tion.

In that work [1] we systematically studied proportional elec-
troluminescence in Ar in the two-phase mode, with a minor
(∼50 ppm) admixture of N2, that might be typical for large-
scale liquid Ar experiments [23, 24]. The results obtained there
indicate that the eﬀect of N2 doping on proportional electrolu-
minescence in Ar is enhanced at lower temperatures. In addi-
tion, the S2 signal response was found to be substantially (by a
factor of 3) enhanced due to the fraction of the N2 emission
spectrum recorded directly, i.e. escaping re-emission in the
WLS ﬁlm and thus having a considerably higher light collec-
tion eﬃciency.

In this work we present some topics on the performance of
the two-phase CRAD with EL gap in N2-doped Ar, not covered
in the previous work, namely the results of the measurements
of the N2 content, amplitude characteristics for X-ray-induced
signals, EL gap yield and electron lifetime in the liquid.

2. Experimental setup and procedures

Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup; it is described elsewhere
[1]. Here we present the details relevant to the present study.
The setup comprised a 9 l cryogenic chamber ﬁlled with 2.5
liters of liquid Ar. Ar was taken from a bottle with a speciﬁed
purity of 99.998%. During each cooling procedure Ar was puri-
ﬁed from electronegative impurities by Oxisorb ﬁlter, providing
electron lifetime in the liquid >100 µs. The detector was oper-
ated in two-phase mode in the equilibrium state, at a saturated
vapor pressure of 1.000±0.003 atm and at a temperature of 87.3
K.

Figure 1: Schematic view of the experimental setup (not to scale). The resistors
of the voltage divider have the following values: R1, R2, R3 and R4 is 80, 40,
4 and 600 MOhm respectively.

It should be noted that a reliable measurement of the N2 con-
tent in the cryogenic system at ppm level is a challenge; we
describe below how this problem was solved. After each cryo-
genic measurement, the Ar was liquiﬁed from the chamber back
to a stainless steel bottle (”CRAD bottle”) cooled with liquid ni-
trogen, so that the N2 content remained constant throughout the
entire measurement campaign. The latter lasted 5 months dur-
ing which the setup (operated on a closed loop) was repeatedly
evacuated but neither baked nor puriﬁed from N2, resulting in a
certain N2 content established in the system due to combined ef-
fect of the residual gas and internal outgassing in the bottle and
cryogenic chamber. At the end of the campaign, the N2 content
in the CRAD bottle was measured in two ways: ﬁrst, using a
Residual Gas Analyzer (RGA) Pfeiﬀer-Vacuum QME220, and
second, using a chromatography technique.

In case of RGA technique, the CRAD bottle was connected
to a baked high-vacuum (4 × 10−9 mbar) test chamber equipped
with RGA, where the N2 content in Ar was measured in a ﬂow
mode at a pressure reaching 10−4 mbar: see Fig. 2. It should
be remarked that the RGA readings were diﬃcult to get rid of
the inﬂuence of outgassing from the walls of the test chamber

and lead-in tubes. Therefore only the relative N2 content had
the meaning, measured with respect to the reference bottle with
a known N2 content. Thus the N2 content value obtained using
this technique was 56±5 ppm: it was composed of the diﬀer-
ence between the RGA readings for the CRAD and the refer-
ence bottles (51 ppm) and of the N2 content of the reference
bottle (5±5 ppm) speciﬁed by the manufacturer.

In case of chromatography technique, the N2 content in the
CRAD bottle was measured by a local industrial company
”Pure Gases”:
it amounted to 42 ppm. Thus the ﬁnal value
of N2 content, averaged over the two techniques, amounted to
49±7 ppm. In the two-phase mode at 87 K, this value corre-
sponds to the N2 content of 49 ppm in the liquid and 132 ppm
in the gas phase, according to ”Raoult” law [25].

The cryogenic chamber included a cathode electrode, ﬁeld-
shaping electrodes and a THGEM0, immersed in a 55 mm thick
liquid Ar layer. These elements were biased through a resis-
tive high-voltage divider placed within the liquid, forming a
drift region in liquid Ar, 48 mm long. A 4 mm thick liquid
Ar layer above the THGEM0 acted as an electron emission re-
gion. A double-THGEM assembly, consisting of a THGEM1
and THGEM2, was placed in the gas phase above the liquid.
The EL gap (the EL region), 18 mm thick, was formed by the
liquid surface and the THGEM1 plate; the latter was grounded
through a resistor acting as an anode of the gap. All electrodes
had the same active area, of 10×10 cm2.

The voltage applied to the divider varied from 11 to 22
kV, producing the electric drift ﬁeld in liquid Ar of 0.34-0.68
kV/cm, electric emission ﬁeld of 2.6-5.1 kV/cm and electric
ﬁeld in the EL gap of 4.0-8.0 kV/cm. Using such a voltage
divider, the THGEM0 was biased in a way to provide the ef-
fective transmission of drifting electrons from the drift region
to that of electron emission: the electrons drifted successively
from a lower to higher electric ﬁeld region, with a ﬁeld ratio of
about 3 at each step, which in principle should result in electron
transmittance through the THGEM0 approaching 100%. The

2

 
 
 
 
average drift time of the primary ionization electrons across the
drift, emission and EL regions varied from about 25 to 35 µs,
depending on the applied electric ﬁelds.

The detector was irradiated from outside by X-rays from a
pulsed X-ray tube [10], with the energy of 30-40 keV after X-
ray ﬁltering [1], those from 109Cd source, with the energy of 22-
25 and 88 keV, and those from 241Am source, with the energy
of 60 keV.

The EL gap was viewed by four compact cryogenic 2-inch
PMTs R6041-506MOD [21], located on the perimeter of the
gap. The PMTs were electrically insulated from the gap by a
grounded mesh and an acrylic protective box of a rectangular
shape. To convert the VUV into the blue light, four wavelength
shifter (WLS) ﬁlms, based on TPB (tetraphenyl-butadiene) in
polystyrene matrix, were deposited on the inner box surface
facing the EL gap, in front of each PMT. In addition, propor-
tional electroluminescence in the spectral range other than the
VUV, i.e.
in the NUV (and visible and NIR range, if any)
could be recorded using a MPPC (Multi-Pixel Photon Counter)
S10931-100P [22], placed behind the THGEM2.

Three types of signals were recorded from the EL gap:
the optical signal from the PMTs, the charge signal from the
THGEM1 acting as an anode of the gap and the optical signal
from the MPPC (see Fig. 3). The optical signal from the four
PMTs, called the total PMT signal, was obtained as a linear
sum of all the PMT signals, ampliﬁed with a linear ampliﬁer
with a shaping time of 200 ns. The THGEM1 charge signal
was recorded using a charge-sensitive preampliﬁer followed by
a shaping ampliﬁer with a time constant of 1 µs. The MPPC op-
tical signal was recorded using a fast ampliﬁer with a shaping
time of 40 ns. Note the rather large drift time of the ionization
electrons in Fig. 3, equal to the distance between the trigger and
the PMT pulse peak, which is about 31 µs.

3. Amplitude characteristics and EL gap yield

The amplitude characteristics of the detector, when record-
ing the S2 (ionization-induced) signal, are illustrated in Fig. 4:
it shows the amplitude spectrum of the total PMT signal from
the EL gap induced by X-rays from a mixture of the 109Cd and
241Am radioactive sources, at an electric ﬁeld of 7.3 kV/cm in
the EL gap and 0.62 kV/cm in the drift region. The peaks due
to X-ray lines at 88 keV and 22-25 keV of the 109Cd source,
as well as that at 60 keV of the 241Am sources, are well dis-
tinguished. The energy resolution improved with energy; it
amounted to σ/E=42, 22 and 16% at 22-25, 59.5 and 88 keV
respectively.

The amplitude in Fig. 4 is expressed in the number of pho-
toelectrons (pe) recorded at the PMTs. This allows one to esti-
mate the detector yield (sensitivity) for electron-equivalent (ee)
recoils induced by X-ray absorption: it is deﬁned as the number
of PMT photoelectrons per keV of deposited energy. The sen-
sitivity amounted to 8.7, 15.1 and 16.1 pe/keV at 22-25, 60 and
88 keV respectively. One can see that the sensitivity degrades
with the energy decrease. Such an energy dependence in fact
rather precisely reﬂects the reduction of the X-ray ionization
yield in liquid Ar with the energy decrease observed elsewhere

Figure 3: Typical signals from the EL gap, namely the total optical signal from
the PMTs, the charge signal from the THGEM1 and the optical signal from
the MPPC, induced by pulsed X-rays absorbed in liquid Ar, at an electric ﬁeld
of 6.5 kV/cm in the EL gap and 0.55 kV/cm in the drift region. Note that the
ionization electron drift time, equal to the distance between the trigger indicated
by a triangle and the PMT pulse peak, is about 31 µs.

[10]. It was described there by the following dependence of
the relative ionization yield (ne/Ni) on the energy (E): at a drift
ﬁeld of 0.6 kV/cm, ne/Ni = 0.54/(1+41/E[keV])=0.195, 0.320
and 0.368 at 23, 60 and 88 keV respectively.

The fact that the detector yield is proportional (within the
experimental uncertainties, of about 5% [10]) to the X-ray ion-
ization yield in liquid Ar allows one to estimate, inter alia, the
lower limit of the electron lifetime in the liquid, using the fact
that the electron drift path in liquid Ar is larger for softer X-rays
than that for harder X-rays. The electron lifetime estimated this
way exceeds 130 µs.

Another estimate of the lifetime can be obtained from Fig. 5
showing the EL gap yield as a function of the electric ﬁeld in the
gap for X-rays from the pulsed X-ray tube, using the measured
charge, and from the 241Am source, using the calculated charge.
In the latter case the ionization charge arrived to the THGEM1
(anode) was too small to be measured. Consequently it was
calculated theoretically by interpolation of the X-ray ionization
yield dependence on energy at diﬀerent electric ﬁelds using the
data of ref. [10]. One can see from Fig. 5 that the EL gap yield

electric ﬁeld of 7.3 kV/cm in the EL gap and 0.62 kV/cm in the drift region,

amplitude is expressed in the number of photoelectrons (pe) recorded at the
PMTs.

for 60 keV X-rays is systematically reduced compared to that
of pulsed X-rays. This reduction is due to the combined eﬀect
of the electron transmittance through the THGEM0 and elec-
tron lifetime in the liquid, not taking into account in the charge
calculation. Hence we obtain the lower limit on the electron
lifetime of 70 µs. Finally the electron lifetime in the liquid av-
eraged over the two estimates exceeds 100 µs.

In addition, one can conclude from Fig. 5 that the EL gap
yield can be as high as 1.5 pe/e at an electric ﬁeld in the gap of
7 kV/cm. This is a factor of 3 higher than expected in ”pure Ar”
approach and is due to the fraction of the N2 emission spectrum
recorded directly, i.e. escaping re-emission in the WLS ﬁlm
and thus having a considerably higher (by a factor of 20) light
collection eﬃciency [1].

4. Conclusions

Following our ﬁrst work in the ﬁeld [1], we continued to
study the performance of the two-phase Cryogenic Avalanche
Detector (CRAD) with electroluminescence (EL) gap, operated
in argon doped with a minor (49±7 ppm) admixture of nitro-
gen. The results of the measurements of the N2 content, de-
tector sensitivity to X-ray-induced (electron-equivalent recoil)
signals, EL gap yield and electron lifetime in the liquid were
presented. The detector sensitivity at a drift ﬁeld in liquid Ar of
about 0.6 kV/cm was measured to be 9 and 16 pe/keV at 23 and
88 keV respectively. The EL gap yield may reach 1.5 pe per
drifting electron at an electric ﬁeld in the gap of 7 kV/cm. The
results obtained pave the way to the development of N2-doped
two-phase Ar detectors with enhanced sensitivity to the S2 sig-
nal. Such detectors are relevant in the ﬁeld of argon detectors
for dark matter search and low energy neutrino detection.
