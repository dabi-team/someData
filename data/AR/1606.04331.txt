Abstract

We study L2-maximal regularity in a Hilbert space H for non-autonomous linear evolution

equations of the form

˙u(t) + A(t)u(t) = f (t) t ∈ [0, T ], u(0) = u0.

(1)

where A(t), t ∈ [0, T ] arise from a non-autonomous sesquilinear forms a(t, ·, ·) with constant
domain V ⊂ H. L2−maximal regularity result is proved recently in [7] when a is Hölder
continuous of type α > 1/2. In this paper we recover the same results by the approximation
method developed in [19], [35] and [20]. The method uses an appropriate approximation AΛ(·)
of A(·) for which

˙uΛ(t) + AΛ(t)uΛ(t) = f (t) t ∈ [0, T ], uΛ(0) = u0
(2)
has L2-maximal regularity where Λ is a subdivision of [0, T ]. Furthermore, we show that there
exists a sequence (Λn)n∈N of subdivisions of [0, T ] depending on the modulus of continuity such
that the sequenece of the solutions uΛn of (2) converges in L2(0, T, V )∩H 1(0, T, H)∩C(0, T, V )
uniformly on the initial datas (u0, f ) to the solution u of (1) as n → 0. Moreover, we show
that such an uniform converges with respect to initial datas holds for arbitrary subdivision of
[0, T ] under a little more assumptions on the modulus of continuity.

applications to boundary valued problems maximal regularity in V ′ is not suﬃcient. Only the part

Problem 0.2. If f

L2(0, T ; H) and u0 ∈

V , does the solution u of (3) belong to H 1(0, T ; H) ?
This problem is asked by Lions in [26, p. 68] for u0 = 0 and a(t, u, v) = a(t, v, u), i.e., a
is symmetric. A recent result by Dier [14], show that the answer of this question is negative
in general.On the other hand, some positive results are due to Lions [26, p. 68, p. 94, ], [26,
Theorem 1.1, p. 129] and [26, Theorem 5.1, p. 138] and to Bardos [9] under additional regularity
assumptions on the form a, the initial value u0 and the inhomogeneity f. More recently, this
problem has been studied with some progress and diﬀerent approaches by Arendt, Dier, Laasri
and Ouhabaz [6], Arendt and Monniaux [7], Ouhabaz [27], Dier [15], Haak and Ouhabaz [29],
Ouhabaz and Spina [30] and Dier and Zacher [16]. Results on multiplicative perturbation are
established in [6, 15, 8].

In this paper we are interested with the following nice result due to Arendt and Monniaux [7]:

The aim of this paper is to give an explicit approximation of the problem (3) under the assump-
tion of Theorem 0.3, which is very useful to obtain qualitative properties of the unknown solution
u of (3). The method employs an approximation by discretisation of the function
7→
(V, V ′) and then taking a suitable limit. Namely, let Λ := (0 = λ0 < λ1 < ... < λn+1 = T ) be a
subdivision of [0, T ]. Consider an approximation

It is well known that the solution of a non-autonomous linear evolution equation can be given by a
strongly continuous evolution family

will allows us to study whether or not this evolution family is eventually norm continuous. This

Proof. We will use the notation of the the previous sections and we will proceed, as in the proof
of Theorem 4.1, in several steps. To this end, we will adapt the proof of [7, Theorem 4.4] to our
situation.
Step a: By using (2) and (5) in Proposition 2.1 for (λ
and (40) we obtain for every t

− AΛ(t))−1, respectively,

− AΓ(t))−1 and (λ

Proof. Assertion 1) follows by similar argument as in the proof of Corollary 4.2. By Theorem
5.1, uΛ is a Cauchy sequence, and thus converges in C([0, T ], V ). In other hand, we known that
u strongly in C([0, T ], H). Therefore, assertion 2) is a direct consequence of 1) and the
uΛ −→
assertion 3) follows directly from the estimate (63) and the additional condition (53).
