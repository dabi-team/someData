Rankings of countries based on rankings of universities 

Bahram Kalhor1, Farzaneh Mehrparvar2 

Abstract 

Although many methods have been designed for ranking universities, there is no suitable system 
that focuses on the ranking of countries based on the performance of their universities. The overall 
ranking of the universities in a region can indicate the growth of interests in science among the 
people of that land. This paper introduces a novel ranking mechanism based on the rankings of 
universities. Firstly, we introduce and discuss two new rankings of countries, based on the rank of 
their  universities.  Secondly,  we  create  rankings  of  countries  according  to  the  selected  method, 
based on the top 12000 universities in webometrics.info (January 2012) and compare rankings of 
countries in  4 editions  (January 2012 to  July  2013). Firstly, we introduce two new methods of 
ranking  countries  based  on  their  university  rankings,  Weighted  Ranking  (WR)  and  Average 
Ranking  (AR).  Secondly,  we  discuss  how  the  introduced  ranking  systems,  perform  in  ranking 
countries based on the two years of data. Thirdly, we choose QS (http://www.topuniversities.com) 
and webometrics.info as two different classification systems for comparing rankings of countries, 
based on the top 500 universities in these rankings. Results indicate that the methodology can be 
used to show the quality of the whole universities of each country used to compare rankings of 
countries in practice compare to other countries in the world. 

Introduction 

Unlike rankings of universities, rankings of countries have not yet been the focus of considerable 
study in the web rankings research. There are many countries in which most of their universities 
belong  to  the  government.  In  these  countries,  universities  must  follow  their  country  policies, 
especially  on the internet.  Finding rankings of countries based on rankings of universities help 
researchers for comparing the performance of government decisions in the educational institutes 
and universities. 

Higher education institutions are using rankings as a promotion tool that shows their educational 
and research excellence. Universities use these rankings for increasing their research performance 
(Isidro F. Aguillo, Judit Bar-lan, Mark Levene, Jose Luis Ortega, 2010). Local and international 
rankings  have  been  focused  by  higher  education  policymakers  (Ghane,  Khosrowjerdi  & 
(THE-QS, 
Azizkhani, 
http://www.topuniversities.com/home), rankings of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ARWU, 
http://www.arwu.org),  rankings  of  the  Higher  Education  and  Accreditation  Council  of  Taiwan

(HEEACT, http://ranking.heeact.edu.tw), web rankings of World Universities by the Cybermetrics 
Lab at CSIC (WR, http://www.webometrics.info), web rankings of Iranian Universities (RICEST, 
http://websanji.ricest.ac.ir), rankings of the Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden 
University (CWTS, http://ranking.heeact.edu.tw),  rankings of the SCImago Research Group (SJR, 
http://www.scimagoir.com) and 4 International Colleges & Universities (http://www.4icu.org) are 
the famous rankings of universities. 

The concept of using rankings of universities for calculating countries‚Äô educational rankings is the 
central focus of this article. We used the data from the 4 data set updates, in two years, on university 
rankings of Webometrics. We produce country rankings from the January 2012 list and compare 
their rankings to the July 2012, January 2013, and July 2013. WR is a web-based ranking (21451 
universities,  January  2014)  which  is  published  every  six  months.  We  use  a  list  of  12000 
universities from each edition. We study and discuss changes in countries‚Äô ranks in one ranking of 
universities (WR) among the time. We also compare the rankings of countries in two different 
classification systems. We compare the rank of countries in the top 500 WR (January 2012) with 
the countries' rank in the top 500 THE-QS (2012). 

Methodology 

the 

list 

top 

12000 

webometrics.info 

For  quantitative  purposes,  data  of  universities  and  research  centers  have  been  extracted  from 
webometrics.info  and  QS.  Although  webometrics.info  only  provides  the  latest  rankings  of 
universities,  in  the  last  three  years  we  have  saved  a  full  list  of  rankings  of  universities  from 
Webometrics.info. Webometrics.info collects data for all the universities of the world. The latest 
domains 
contains 
main 
(http://webometrics.info/en/world?page=119). Webometrics‚Äô previous editions have only the top 
500 universities from July 2009 (http://webometrics.info/en/Previous_editions). Many countries 
don‚Äôt have any university in the top 500 (http://webometrics.info/en/node/54) thus in the last three 
years  we  have  saved  a  full  list  of  rankings  of  universities  (top  12000  domains)  from 
Webometrics.info in our database. In this article, we use this database for calculating rankings of 
countries.  In  this  study,  we  also  produce  QS  countries‚Äô  rank  based  on  the  top  500  QS  World 
University  Rankings 
http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-
university-rankings/2012) and compare with WR countries‚Äô rank (webometrics.info) based on top 
500 WR universities (January 2012). To compare the rankings of countries in each edition top 50 
world countries with the highest number of universities in the WR (January 2012) were selected 
(Table 1). In this list United States of America with 2883 universities (January 2012) is at the top 
and Egypt with 34 universities is at the bottom of the list. Selected top 50 countries list contains 
10927 universities (Table 1). 

(2012, 

In the end, we used the top 500 QS universities (QS, 2012) for comparing to the top 500 WR (WR, 
January  2012)  universities.  Although  Webometrics.info  provides  12000  universities  in  each 
edition and QS provides 750 universities, we used the top 500 universities. The simplest way of 
calculating the rank of one country is by calculating average rank. We define the average rank for 

one  country  as  the  sum  of  the  universities  rank  belongs  to  that  country  divide  to  count  of 
universities. 

AR =

n
‚àë Ri
i=1
n

Where AR is the Average Rank of the country and n is the total number of universities that belong 
to the country. Country average rank (AR), has two major problems drawback. The first problem 
is  that  items  of  each  edition  are  not  identical  and  comparing  overlapping  universities  is  not 
recommended. In this case, exiting one university at the bottom of the rankings list makes better 
AR  for  the  country.  The  Second  problem  issue  is  the  huge  differences  between  the  number  of 
universities in each country. One country with a lower number of universities maybe takes a better 
position in the ranking table rather than a country like the United States of America which occupied 
the most position of top 100 universities (Table 4). To address the drawbacks of the AR problems 
system, we defined W as a new indicator that allows us to detect the weight of countries. 

n

W=‚àë(M-ùëÖùëñ + 1)

i=1

Where the W is the weight of the country, n is the total number of universities number of each country, M 
is the total number of universities number in the world‚Äôs list (12000 in this study) and i is the ranking of 
each  university  in  the  Webometrics.info.  W  has  the  value  zero  when  the  country  does  not  have  any 
university at the world‚Äôs list, its maximum value is M*(M+1)/2. Table 6 shows the calculated W according 
to the universities ranking for the top 50 countries in WR for 4 editions of different data sets. The Maximum 
W  in  July  2012  belongs  to  the  United  State  of  America  with  18943854  and  the  lowest  W  belongs  to 
Morocco with 103988. 

M=12000 

Min W=0 

Max W= M*(M+1)/2 =7200600 

1+2+3+4+‚Ä¶. + M=M*(M+1)/2 

Both problems of AR are solved by using W.  

Results 

Weighted ranking (W) provides a new way to compare countries. We can compare changes of countries‚Äô 
rankings  in  this  new  ranking‚Äôs  list  to  other  official  rankings‚Äô  list.  Also,  we  can  compare  two  separate 
rankings‚Äô lists. In the top 500 QS, there are 50 countries (Table 2) and in the top 500 WR, there are 48 
countries (Table 3). 

 
 
 
Comparing four editions of WR  

Table (6) shows the ranks of 50 countries in four WR editions. Selected countries are the countries with the 
highest universities number in January 2012, ranks have been produced based on country weight (table 5). 
The United State of America, china, and japan are at the top of the list. The highest drop from January 2012 
to July 2013 belongs to Romania with 9 levels and the highest increase belongs to Pakistan with 5 levels.

Comparing ranks of countries in top 500 WR and top 500 QS 

Most  of  the  researchers  who  analyze  rankings  of  universities,  use  the  data  from  the  top  500  universities 
(http://webometrics.info/en/node/54, 2014). For the two rankings, WR and QS, we calculated the ranks rankings of countries 
based on the top 500 universities list. Table (7) shows the ranks rankings of countries in QS (2012) and table (8) shows the 
ranks rankings of countries in WR (January 2012). 

M=500 

Max W= M*(M-1)/2 =124750  

Tables (7) and (8) show count the number of universities, weight of countries and total country‚Äôs ranking in the top 500 WR 
and top 500 QS lists. The result shows that the rankings of two universities‚Äô rankings are highly similar.

Limitations and Discussion 

Changing methodology of the rankings of universities are the study‚Äôs main limitations. Results which have been calculated 
based on each edition are not comparable. For comparing rankings of universities in different editions we should re-rank 
previous data with the new methodology. Characteristics of the Web are second limitation. We know search engines‚Äô 
results are not stable and changing continuously. Also, data sources‚Äô policies change among the time and providers lead 
to use new data sources for attracting web statistics. Rankings of universities which are based on web data sources only 
valid for the time span which they are collected and result calculated. 

Conclusion 

In  this  paper,  we  introduced  the  new  rankings  of  countries  methods.  Average  rank  of  universities  (AR)  and  weighting 
countries (W) based on their university ranks. The average rank is simple but not suitable to show a good view of countries 
rank. Using W in one ranking of universities in different editions shows us the result of the activities of countries to take 
better rank. The current study covered two universities‚Äô rankings which are very different methodologies. We compared 
different world universities‚Äô rankings (QS & WR) using W. The results show that the rankings of two rankings lists (WR 
and QS) are highly similar. On the other hand, deposit each ranking used different methods. This gives some confidence 
that to W is a robust algorithm to rank all countries around the world.
