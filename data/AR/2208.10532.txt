ABSTRACT

We conduct the ﬁrst systematic survey of a comprehensive set of the twenty optical coronal lines in the spectra
of nearly 1 million galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 catalog. This
includes often overlooked high ionization-potential (IP) lines such as [Ar X] λ5533, [S XII] λ7609, [Fe XI]
λ7892, and [Fe XIV] λ5303. We ﬁnd that, given the limited sensitivity of SDSS, strong coronal line emission
0.03% of the sample showing at least one coronal line, signiﬁcantly lower than
is extremely rare, with only

2%) indicative
of nuclear activity. The coronal line luminosities exhibit a large dynamic range, with values ranging from

mass galaxies. These ﬁndings are consistent with the theory that lower mass black holes found in lower mass
galaxies produce a hotter accretion disk, which in turn enhances the higher ionization coronal line spectrum.
Future coronal line searches with 30 m class telescopes or JWST may provide a pathway into uncovering the

1. INTRODUCTION

High ionization ﬁne-structure lines have been known to
exist in the optical spectra of nearby active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) for almost sixty years (e.g., Oke & Sargent 1968;
Nussbaumer & Osterbrock 1970; Grandi 1978; Penston &
Perez 1984; Appenzeller & Oestreicher 1988; Prieto et al.
2002; Lamperti et al. 2017; Müller-Sánchez et al. 2018).
These so-called “coronal lines”, ﬁrst observed in the so-
lar corona, arise from collisionally excited forbidden ﬁne-
structure transitions in highly ionized species, with ioniza-
tion potentials that extend well beyond the Lyman limit to
several hundred electron volts. This corresponds to the so-
called “Big Blue Bump” thought to arise from the accretion
disk emission (e.g., Lynden-Bell 1969; Mushotzky & Fer-

land 1984; Netzer 1985; Pogge & Peterson 1992) and the
“soft excess” characteristic of AGN soft X-ray spectra (Kro-
lik 1999; Boissay et al. 2016). While systematic surveys of
the strong emission lines seen in the optical spectra of galax-
ies have now been carried out on millions of galaxies and
their diagnostic potential in studying star formation and ac-
cretion activity well-established (e.g., Kauffmann et al. 2003;
Brinchmann et al. 2004), no such large scale systematic sur-
vey of the much weaker coronal lines has been carried out
on similarly large samples of galaxies. Because of their high
107–1010
ionization potentials and high critical densities (
cm−3), coronal lines are powerful probes of the highly ion-
ized and dense gas in galaxy centers. They have the potential
to identify elusive AGNs missed by optical narrow line ratios
and mid-infrared color selection which suffer from contami-
nation from star formation in the host galaxy (e.g., Goulding
& Alexander 2009; Trump et al. 2015; Satyapal et al. 2018,
2021), and may actually be a powerful tool in identifying ac-
creting intermediate mass black holes (e.g., Cann et al. 2018,
2021; Molina et al. 2021a,b).

Coronal lines can indirectly probe the spectral energy dis-
tribution (SED) of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld from the Ly-
man limit up to several hundred electron volts, a region of the
electromagnetic spectrum that is observationally inaccessible
because of Galactic and intrinsic absorption (e.g., Moorwood
et al. 1996; Alexander et al. 2000). As a result, they can po-
tentially be used to constrain accretion disk models, and even
possibly the mass of the black hole (Cann et al. 2018; Prieto
et al. 2022). The resulting intrinsic SED is also of interest in
studying the effect of the AGN on its environment, and the
line ratios can also be used to infer the gas density and tem-
perature of the highly ionized and dense gas close to the cen-
tral supermassive black hole (SMBH). Finally, because the
line proﬁles often show asymmetrical proﬁles indicative of
outﬂows, with outﬂow properties often showing correlations
between ionization potential and critical density (e.g., Erkens
et al. 1997; Rodríguez-Ardila et al. 2006; Bohn et al. 2021),
coronal lines can be used to study outﬂows in the most highly
ionized gas near their launch origin, a crucial input in under-
standing AGN feedback and its impact on star formation in
the host galaxy.

With the advent of the next generation of 30 m class ex-
tremely large telescope (ELTs), unprecedented sensitivity
and spatial resolution will become possible within the com-
ing decade. Large scale surveys of the fainter coronal lines
will be feasible, resulting in transformative advances in our
understanding of the highly ionized gas in galaxy centers
with extremely high spatial resolution. While most past op-
tical and near-infrared coronal line studies have exclusively
targeted AGNs (Rodríguez-Ardila et al. 2002; Riffel et al.
2006; Rodríguez-Ardila et al. 2011; Müller-Sánchez et al.
2011; Lamperti et al. 2017; Müller-Sánchez et al. 2018),
there have been a few studies aimed at the general galaxy
population. In a large scale search for [Fe X] λ6374 emission,
Gelbord et al. (2009) identiﬁed 63 galaxies with detections,
all of which were previously identiﬁed as AGNs. Recently,
Negus et al. (2021) conducted an extensive search for coro-
nal line emission in integral ﬁeld data and found 10 coronal
line emitters, 7 of which were known AGNs, all showing spa-
tially extended emission. In other recent work, Molina et al.
(2021b) searched for [Fe X] λ6374 emission in a large sample
of dwarf galaxies, ﬁnding convincing evidence for previously
hidden AGNs in the dwarf galaxy population. These studies
have hinted at the diagnostic potential of coronal lines in the
general galaxy population and have provided tantalizing ev-
idence for their power in uncovering previously unidentiﬁed
AGNs, but no study thus far has explored all of the optically
accessible coronal lines in any sample, and studies of the
comprehensive set of optical coronal lines in large samples
of galaxies does not yet exist. The full diagnostic potential
of coronal lines from current optical surveys has therefore
not yet been extracted.

In this work, we introduce the Coronal Line Activity Spec-
troscopic Survey (CLASS) for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) catalog. We quantify for the ﬁrst time the detection
statistics for all optical coronal lines detected in the SDSS
spectra of a large sample of galaxies, and analyze the host
galaxy demographics of coronal line emitters compared to
those from other galaxy classes, and the sample as a whole.
The full CLASS catalog, with an in-depth description of our
methodology and all coronal line ﬂuxes and kinematics, is
presented in Reefe et al. 2022b. Throughout this paper, we
assume a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1,
Ωm = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7.

2. SAMPLE SELECTION AND METHODOLOGY

∼

The creation of the CLASS catalog begins with the SDSS
MPA/JHU DR8 catalog (Eisenstein et al. 2011; Aihara et al.
2011; Gunn et al. 2006; Smee et al. 2013)1, which contains
3300–8000 Å) spectra of galaxies. We
952,138 optical (
choose this data release in particular to utilize the derived
host galaxy properties available for each spectrum, including
stellar masses and star formation rates. We perform no initial
pre-selection on this sample based on nuclear activity and in-
stead conduct a search for all coronal line emission in the en-
tire extragalactic population. In this work, we systematically
search for every coronal line that is present at optical wave-
lengths, from the [Ne V] λλ3346,3426 doublet at the blue end
to the high ionization-potential [Fe XI] λ7892 at the red end.
We note that most previous coronal line searches have ex-
clusively targeted already identiﬁed AGNs, or are based on a
single or small set of coronal lines. Moreover, previous stud-
ies often impose requirements on the detection or widths of
other lines (e.g [O I] λ6302 for [Fe X] λ6374 searches) and
use these as pre-selection strategies in generating the ﬁnal
sample. We emphasize that our methodology is designed to
be inclusive, with no bias imposed in our pre-selection strat-
egy. Our goal is to gain an understanding of the demograph-
ics of coronal line activity in the general galaxy population
and to quantify for the ﬁrst time their detection rates. The
full list of coronal lines can be found in Table 1.

We construct a sample of candidate coronal line emitters
by applying a pre-selection ﬁltering algorithm to search for
robust detections. For each of the coronal lines listed in Ta-
ble 1, we perform a linear ﬁt to the continuum using two
adjacent reference regions
30 Å on either side of the the
line of interest, adjusting the location as necessary to ensure
that they fall on a ﬂat and featureless part of the continuum,
and subtract this from the average ﬂux in a 20 Å region cen-
tered on the coronal line. We then calculate the root-mean-
square (RMS) deviation of the ﬂux in the adjacent reference
windows, which quantiﬁes the noise in the continuum, and

require that the average ﬂux centered on each coronal line is
at least 4σ above the noise. This ﬁltering is achieved with
a custom-made Python package called BIFRÖST2. We note
that this pre-selection algorithm is designed to identify the
most robust detections in the entire sample, and will neces-
sarily exclude marginal detections.

To eliminate spurious detections and contamination from
nearby sky lines, we impose the additional constraints that
our coronal line candidate spectra must have at least 3 con-
tinuous pixels above 3σ and must not be within
20 Å (or

Monte Carlo (MCMC) ﬁt using the afﬁne-invariant Emcee

certainties and covariances. The BADASS ﬁtting routine
breaks down a spectrum into its base components, modeling
the AGN power-law continuum, Fe II emission, and spec-
tral lines, simultaneously with the stellar line-of-sight ve-
locity distribution (LOSVD) using the penalized pixel-ﬁtting

(pPXF; Cappellari 2017) method. Each coronal line is mod-
eled as a simple Gaussian proﬁle with a free amplitude, ve-
locity offset, and width. We also do not ﬁt the entire wave-
length range of the spectrum at once, but instead subdivide
it into smaller regions of a few hundred angströms to glean
basic information about the continuum level. We require the
model-ﬁt ﬂux of each line to be above 3σ.

For a few speciﬁc lines, we impose additional con-
straints on certain parameters. Doublets such as [Fe VII]
λλ5720,6087 have their widths and offsets tied. The ﬂux
ratio of the [O I] λλ6302,6365 doublet is ﬁxed to 3, as pre-
dicted by atomic physics, and the line widths and velocity
offsets are both tied to [N II] λ6585, ensuring that the nearby
[Fe X] λ6374 can be robustly distinguished from [O I].

We then perform a ﬁnal round of visual inspection before
conﬁrming each coronal line detection. We present a selec-
tion of 6 individual spectra that show some of the most com-
monly detected coronal lines in Figure 1, with the spectral
ﬁt overlaid. Our ﬁnal sample contains 258 galaxies (
0.03%
of the catalog). The coronal line luminosities in our sam-
ple range from 1034–1042 erg s−1, with a median value of
1040 erg s−1. The average and standard deviation of
1.08
the luminosity for each coronal line is listed in Table 1. The
redshifts of our coronal line sample ranged from 0–0.3, with
an average of 0.105

0.100.

The galaxies in our sample are classiﬁed as AGNs or star
forming (SF) galaxies based on optical narrow emission line
ratios, using the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagnos-
tics (Baldwin et al. 1981), as well as mid-infrared color se-
lection. For optical selection, we use the K03 (Kauffmann
et al. 2003) and K01 (Kewley et al. 2001) selection criteria
to classify spectra as AGNs or SF galaxies using ﬂuxes pro-
vided in the MPA/JHU catalog, requiring a signal to noise
> 3 on the relevant narrow line detections. In order to clas-
sify galaxies in the sample according to their mid-infrared
color, we matched the MPA/JHU DR8 catalog to the ﬁnal

±

public AllWISE catalog3, where a galaxy is matched if the
positions agree to within 6(cid:48)(cid:48). We require that all objects be
detected with a signal-to-noise > 5 in the 3.4 µm W 1 and 4.6
µm W 2 bands in order to employ a mid-infrared color diag-
nostic. We use the 3-band AGN color cut from Jarrett et al.
(2011) to identify mid-infrared AGNs in the sample. In or-
der to obtain information on the host galaxy morphologies,
we use the magnitudes and Sersic indices, obtained from sin-
gle component two dimensional ﬁts to the surface brightness
proﬁles, from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog (version
1.0.1)4.

One of our goals is to quantify the detection statistics for
each of the 20 coronal lines in this study. Because the lu-
minosity of the various coronal lines varies considerably, as
does the signal-to-noise of the observations, the total num-
ber of spectra employed in the calculated detection fraction
varies from line to line. In particular, in calculating detection
fractions, we exclude from consideration spectra in which
the sensitivity is not sufﬁcient to enable a 3σ detection of the
given coronal line with a luminosity equal to the average lu-
minosity amongst our detections. In addition, in calculating
each detection fraction, we exclude from consideration spec-
tra in which the given coronal line is redshifted out of the
SDSS spectral range. We calculate the sensitivity of each
spectrum by integrating a Gaussian with amplitude equal
to the RMS of the ﬂux and width equal to the instrumen-
tal FWHM dispersion, both calculated at the location of the
coronal line. This allows us to account for the non-uniform
sensitivity of the observations to each of the coronal lines, al-
lowing their detection percentages to be directly comparable
to each other, given the sensitivity of SDSS.

We ﬁnd that coronal line emission is extremely rare in
SDSS spectra of galaxies. Given the total sample of 258
galaxies that display at least one coronal line identiﬁed
through our pipeline, the detection fraction using binomial
statistics, with 68% conﬁdence bounds, is 0.0271+0.0018
−0.0017%,
signiﬁcantly lower than the fraction obtained using other
commonly employed diagnostics for nuclear activity.
In
the detection fraction of galaxies identiﬁed
comparison,
as K01 AGNs and WISE AGNs is 16.821
0.031% and
2.002+0.012
−0.011%, respectively. The detection fraction and lumi-
nosity distributions vary considerably for the various lines, as
can be seen from Table 1. Among the most commonly found
coronal lines are [Fe X] λ6374, the [Fe VII] λλ6087,5720
doublet, and the [Ne V] λλ3346,3426 doublet, with detec-
tion fractions upwards of 0.0407%. The least common, on
the other hand, are [S XII] λ7609, and [Fe V] λ3891 with
only 2 detections. The maximum number of coronal lines
that we detect together in a single galaxy is only 6, with two
such galaxies, SDSS specObjIDs 2411797517822879744
and 2904951020922628096. The former exhibits [Fe XI]
λ7892, [Fe X] λ6374, [Fe VII] λλ6087,5720, [Ca V] λ5309,
and [Fe VII] λ5159. The latter exhibits almost the same set of
lines, but shows [Fe XIV] λ5303 instead of [Fe VII] λ5159.
It is clear from this study that it is rare to detect many coro-
nal lines in a single spectrum; 49% of the coronal line emit-
ting galaxies have only one coronal line detected. We note
that because our ﬁltering algorithm is designed to pick out
robust detections and therefore may exclude marginal detec-

tions, our catalog does not include all coronal line detections
reported previously in the literature (e.g. Gelbord et al. 2009;
Molina et al. 2021b). We examine the overlap between the
various samples in more detail in Reefe et al. 2022b.

The most luminous coronal line detected in the sample is
1041 erg
[Ne V] λ3426, with an average luminosity of 1.62
s−1. The strength of this line, in conjunction with its low
IP and its location in a relatively ﬂat part of the spectrum is
consistent with the [Ne V] λλ3426,3346 doublet having one
of the highest detection fractions seen in the optical. The
next most luminous line is the [Fe V] λ3839, with an average
1041 erg s−1. We note that the [Fe V]
luminosity of 1.58
doublet is located nearly directly on top of two higher-order
Balmer lines, Hζ at 3889 Å and Hη at 3835 Å, making the
detection of the line more challenging. Within the few de-
tections for [Fe V] that we claim, the lower-order Hε is not
visible in the spectra, so it is unlikely our results are contami-
nated by these Balmer lines. The least luminous coronal line
in the sample is the [Fe VII] λ5276, with an average lumi-
1037 erg s−1, potentially making it the most
nosity of 1.20
difﬁcult line to detect in the optical.

large fraction of our coronal line emitters do reside in the
K01 region (72%), and mid-infrared AGN region (59%), a
signiﬁcant fraction of coronal line emitters (11%) are not
identiﬁed as AGNs using optical narrow line ratios or mid-
infrared color selection. Moreover, a key and striking result
of this work is that the majority of [Fe X] and higher IP de-
tections are found in the star-forming region of the BPT plot
and outside the Jarrett AGN box in the WISE plot. Note
that although AGNs are expected to produce a hard radiation
ﬁeld, coronal line emission is not universally seen in either
BPT-selected or mid-infrared selected AGNs, a result that
is consistent with numerous other studies (e.g., Nagao et al.
0.2%
2000; Riffel et al. 2006; Lamperti et al. 2017). Only
0.9% of BPT and mid-infrared AGNs showed coro-
and
nal line emission detectable by SDSS in our sample. Given
the average luminosity of coronal lines that are detected in
our sample, and considering only those observations with the
sensitivity to detect them, only 0.2% of K01 and 6.1%, of
WISE AGNs display coronal line emission identiﬁed in our
pipeline. Luminous optical coronal line emission is therefore
intrinsically rare, a result that is explored in McKaig et al.
(2022, in prep.).

3.2. Host galaxy properties

Having identiﬁed coronal line emitters in SDSS, we now
explore the host galaxy demographics of this population and
compare it to those of other galaxy subclasses. Speciﬁcally,
we explore the SFRs, stellar masses, and galaxy morpholo-
gies of the sample. We use the the [N II]/Hα ratio, the most
robust metallicity indicator in galaxies where the primary
source of ionization is not well-constrained (e.g., Groves
et al. 2006) to gain insight into the metallicity of the host
galaxies of our sample in comparison to other subclasses. In
comparing host galaxy morphology, we use the Sérsic index,
nsersic, with low values indicating disk-like morphologies and
higher values corresponding to bulge-dominated morpholo-
gies. Because the Sérsic ﬁts depend on the spatial extent and
hence distance to the galaxies, we match by r-band mag-
nitude when comparing Sérsic indices in BPT-AGNs with
coronal line emitters. In Figure 3, we plot the SFR against
the stellar mass of our sample with the main sequence rela-
tionship from McGaugh et al. (2017) overlaid. The highest
ionization potential coronal line detected in a given galaxy
is indicated by the color bar. As can be seen, a signiﬁcant

a key and striking result from this work is that there is a dra-
matic increase with decreasing stellar mass in coronal line
emitters that are not identiﬁed as BPT AGNs, as can be seen
by Figure 4b. We also see in Figure 4a that in lower mass
hosts, the higher ionization potential coronal lines are more
prevalent than the lower ionization potential lines, in con-
trast to what is found in the higher mass galaxies. Coro-
nal line emitters are also found in lower metallicity galax-
ies based on their [N II]/Hα ratios, as can be seen in Figure
4c. Higher ionization potential coronal lines also possibly
favor disk-like hosts compared with lower ionization poten-
tial lines and BPT-selected AGN hosts (Figure 4d). While the
limited sample size of coronal line emitters precludes us from
conducting a statistically rigorous analysis, this study clearly
demonstrates that coronal line emission is uncovering a dif-
ferent host galaxy population than is revealed by traditional
optical narrow line ratios.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have constructed the CLASS survey, with the goal of
providing for the ﬁrst time a complete census of all optical
coronal line emission in the galaxy population observed by
SDSS. Our survey is designed to pick out all robust detec-
tions of the 20 optical coronal lines accessible in the SDSS
wavelength regime; marginal detections are not included in
the current survey. We ﬁnd that optical coronal line emis-
sion is extremely rare in the galaxy population, even in AGNs
identiﬁed through optical narrow line ratios or mid-infrared
color selection, and even when accounting for the sensitiv-
ity of SDSS. Our detection rate in AGNs is signiﬁcantly
lower than that seen in the near-infrared spectra of AGNs
(Rodríguez-Ardila et al. 2011; Lamperti et al. 2017; Müller-
Sánchez et al. 2018), possibly due to dust extinction, a result
that underscores the crucial need for JWST in future coronal
line studies. This study also demonstrates that, while rare,
a signiﬁcant fraction of coronal line emitters are found in
galaxies with no signs of nuclear activity based on their opti-
cal narrow line ratios or mid-infrared color, with the majority
of coronal line emitters with no optical or mid-IR AGN indi-
cation being found in lower mass hosts. Coronal line emitters
are preferentially found in galaxies with elevated star forma-
tion rates, and tend to reside in more metal-poor, and later-
type galaxies compared to BPT AGNs.

In this work, we have not explored the origin of the coro-
nal line emission, but instead our goal is to provide a com-
plete census of coronal line activity in SDSS and explore
their host galaxy properties. Optical coronal line emission
has been observed in extragalactic supernovae (Benjamin &
Dinerstein 1990; Smith et al. 2009; Izotov & Thuan 2009),
and can be produced by Wolf-Rayet stars, planetary nebula
or shocks from starburst-driven winds (Schaerer & Stasi´nska
1999; Abel & Satyapal 2008; Allen et al. 2008; Zhang et al.

deviation of the full sample is shown in the dashed blue lines.

fraction of the coronal line detections (50 galaxies, or 19.4%
of the 258 coronal line emitters) lie more than 1σ away
from the main sequence relationship, with the vast major-
ity of the higher ionization potential coronal line detections
preferentially found well above the relationship. Similar re-
sults are found by Molina et al. (2021b) in their sample of
[Fe X]-emitting dwarf galaxies. While it is clear that coronal
line emission is preferentially seen in galaxies with elevated
SFRs, this does not necessarily imply that the emission lines
are generated by stellar processes, as pointed out by Molina
et al. (2021b). Elevated accretion activity onto a SMBH or an
elevated tidal-disruption event (TDE) rate may be correlated
with elevated SFRs in galaxies, as nuclear gas availability
may provide the fuel for both accretion and star formation
activity. There is no correlation seen between the host galaxy
speciﬁc SFR and coronal line luminosity, a result we explore
further in Reefe et al. (2022b., in prep.)

In Figure 4, we explore the host galaxy demographics of
coronal line emitters relative to those of BPT-selected and
WISE AGNs. In these plots, we only consider emission line
galaxies in which the [O III] line is detected with S/N (cid:62) 5,
1/3 of the original sample, and plot the
which constitutes
fraction of galaxies in various subclasses of nuclear activity.
We replicate the well-known trend that optical narrow line
diagnostics select AGNs in more massive (Figure 4a), metal
rich (Figure 4c), and bulge-dominated (Figure 4d) hosts (see
Figure 5 in Kauffmann et al. 2003). In contrast, we do not see
the same dramatic drop in coronal line emitters and WISE
AGNs in lower mass galaxies, despite the fact that the lower
mass galaxies suffer greater ﬂux incompleteness. Moreover,

have an [O III] S/N (cid:62) 5, the solid blue line is the fraction of those galaxies that meet the [O III] S/N requirement (of which there are 354,905)
that are classiﬁed as AGN via their BPT ratios using the Kewley et al. (2001) criterion, and the solid green line is the fraction of the [O III]
galaxies that are classiﬁed as AGNs by their WISE colors as in Jarrett et al. (2011). The red lines indicate the fraction of coronal line emitters
out of the initial subsample of 2,834 candidates marked by the BIFRÖST analysis which also meet the [O III] S/N threshold, of which there are
1,651. The solid line includes all coronal line emitters, the dashed line includes only those with IPs < 200 eV, and the dotted line includes only
those with IPs > 200 eV. In panel b, we plot the excess of coronal line detections as a fraction of BPT-identiﬁed AGNs from panel a, of which
there are 62,410. In panel d, the data are subsampled such that the distributions in r magnitude matches between the control BPT AGNs and the
sample coronal line emitters–the BPT fraction is again out of the full sample, while the coronanl line fraction is out of the r-magnitude-matched
BPT subsample, of which there are 5,100.

2012), but their luminosities are generally signiﬁcantly lower
than the luminosities of the coronal lines presented in this
work. Photoionization from stars in lower metallicity galax-
ies can also potentially produce coronal lines. Lower metal-
licity galaxies are dominated by more massive stars which
produce a harder radiation ﬁeld (Campbell et al. 1986), which
in turn can produce an emission line spectrum dominated by
higher ionization potential lines, a result that has been ob-
served with the detection of [Ne V] λλ3346,3426 in blue
compact dwarf galaxies (Izotov et al. 2012, 2021). How-
ever, we reiterate that the luminosities of the coronal lines
in this sample are generally larger than those produced by

purely stellar processes, ranging from 1–2 orders of magni-
tude above those typically seen from stellar processes. Fi-
nally, coronal line emission can be produced by TDEs or ac-
cretion onto a SMBH (Wang et al. 2012). If this is the case,
the prevalence of coronal line emission in dwarf galaxies in
our sample, with the lines with highest ionization potential
preferentially found in lower mass hosts, is consistent with
the theory that lower mass hosts with lower mass black holes
produce a hotter accretion disk, which in turn enhances the
high ionization coronal line spectrum (Cann et al. 2018) and
causes the optical narrow line ratios employed in the BPT
diagram to be indistinguishable from those of star forming

galaxies (Cann et al. 2019). In Reefe et al. (2022b, in prep.),
we present an in-depth description of the CLASS catalog,
provide the full list of line ﬂuxes and kinematics, and ex-
plore the origin of the coronal line emission in our sample.
Given the sensitivity of SDSS and the faintness of coronal
line emission, more sensitive surveys are critical to unlock
their full diagnostic potential. Infrared coronal lines are sig-
niﬁcantly stronger than optical coronal lines. For example,
in the nearby AGN, Circinus, the infrared coronal lines are
up to over two magnitudes more luminous than the optical
coronal lines (Oliva et al. 1994; Moorwood et al. 1996), with
an even more signifcant enhancement of the infrared coro-
nal lines relative to the optical coronal lines anticipated for
intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs, Cann et al. 2018).
Follow-up observations with JWST may thus be a powerful
avenue for uncovering IMBHs and constraining their proper-
ties.
