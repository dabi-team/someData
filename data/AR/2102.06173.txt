Abstract: Here we discuss the current state of knowledge of terrestrial planet formation from 

the  aspects  of  different  planet  formation  models  and  isotopic  data  from  182Hf-182W,  U-Pb, 

lithophile-siderophile  elements,  48Ca/44Ca  isotope  samples  from  planetary  building  blocks, 

recent reproduction attempts from 36Ar/38Ar, 20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/22Ne isotope ratios in Venus’ and 

Earth’s atmospheres, the expected solar 3He abundance in Earth’s deep mantle and Earth’s D/H 

sea  water  ratios  that  shed  light  on  the  accretion  time  of  the  early  protoplanets.  Accretion 

scenarios that can explain the different isotope ratios, including a Moon-forming event ca. 50 

Myr after the formation of the Solar System, support the theory that the bulk of Earth’s mass 

(≥ 80 %) most likely  accreted  within  10  - 30 Myr.  From a combined analysis of the before 

mentioned isotopes, one finds that proto-Earth accreted a mass of 0.5 – 0.6 MEarth within the 

first ≈ 4-5 Myr, the approximate lifetime of the protoplanetary disk. For Venus, the available 

atmospheric noble gas data are too uncertain for constraining the planet’s accretion scenario 

accurately. However, from the available imprecise Ar and Ne isotope measurements, one finds 

that proto-Venus could have grown to a mass of 0.85 – 1.0 MVenus before the disk dissipated. 

Classical terrestrial planet formation models have struggled to grow large planetary embryos, 

or even cores of giant planets, quickly from the tiniest materials within the typical lifetime of 

protoplanetary disks. Pebble accretion could solve this long-standing time scale controversy. 

Pebble accretion and streaming instabilities produce large planetesimals that grow into Mars-

sized and larger planetary embryos during this early accretion phase. The later stage of accretion 

can be explained well with the Grand-Tack model  as  well as the  annulus and depleted disk 

models.  The  relative  roles  of  pebble  accretion  and  planetesimal  accretion/giant  impacts  are 
1 

 
 
 
 
poorly understood and should be investigated with N-body simulations that include pebbles and 

multiple protoplanets. To summarise, different isotopic dating methods and the latest terrestrial 

planet  formation  models  indicate  that  the  accretion  process  from  dust  settling,  planetesimal 

formation,  and  growth  to  large  planetary  embryos  and  protoplanets  is  a  fast  process  that 

occurred to a great extent in the Solar System within the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk.

1.  Introduction 

Terrestrial  planets  accrete  mass  by  numerous  collisions  between  small  objects  that 

accumulate  into  larger  ones,  thereby  forming  planetesimals,  and  Moon-  and  Mars-mass 

planetary embryos that eventually grow into planets. An illustration of a schematic time scale 

of the accretion of terrestrial planets is shown in Fig. 1. One can see four main accretion stages: 

i)  dust  settling;  ii)  planetesimal  formation;  iii)  formation  of  Moon-  to  Mars-mass  planetary 

embryos;  and  iv)  the  accretion  of  protoplanets  up  to  terrestrial  planetary  masses  by  giant 

impacts  (e.g.,  Morbidelli  et  al.,  2012;  Brasser,  2013;  Johansen  et  al.,  2015;  Birnstiel  et  al., 

2016). The bulk composition of the silicate part of terrestrial planets has long been linked to a 

fraction  of  carbonaceous  chondritic  meteorites  (CI,  CV,  CM,  etc.),  which  was  mixed  with 

enstatite  chondrites  (EC)  and  ordinary  chondrites  (OC)  according  to  mainly  oxygen  isotope 

evidence (Drake and Righter, 2002; Dauphas, 2017; Birmingham et al., 2020, this issue), and/or 

ureilite-like material based on recent analysed 48Ca/44Ca data in samples that originated from 

ureilite and angrite meteorites, as well as from Vesta, Mars and Earth (Schiller et al., 2018). 

As illustrated in Fig. 1, depending on their speed of growth before or after disk dissipation 

and  their  orbital  locations  of  origin/destination,  protoplanets  will  evolve  into  objects  with 

different  volatile  and  elemental  abundances,  which  results  in  different  elemental  ratios 

compared to their initial ones due to subsequent atmospheric escape and/or impact erosion of 

atmospheres and crustal/mantle material (e.g., Lammer et al., 2020a; this issue; O’Neill et al., 

2020; this issue). 

Safronov (1969) proposed the first physical model for the formation of the terrestrial planets. 

He suggested that the earliest stage of accumulation of dust into planetesimals was caused by 

gravitational instabilities in a thin dust layer in the midplane of the protoplanetary disk. Due to 

their  gravitational  interaction,  the  ensuing  planetesimals  are  stirred  and  can  encounter  each 

other. Safronov (1969) showed that the relative velocities between planetesimals are typically 

of  the  order  of  their  surface  escape  velocity,  so  that  each  planetesimal’s  gravitational  cross 

section is limited by the geometrical one, restricting the accretion rate. Wetherill (1980) built 

2 

 
 
upon these ideas and suggested that the terrestrial planets coagulated from planetesimals, and 

that the formation of these planets was linked with the evolution of the asteroid belt. Wetherill 

and Stewart (1989) subsequently showed that in a disk of planetesimals, some would undergo 

runaway growth and form a sequence of planetary embryos. These embryos would then further 

collide to form the terrestrial planets. 

Fig. 1: Illustration of the five main formation stages of the terrestrial planet formation: dust 
settling  (I),  planetesimal  formation  (II),  formation  of  planetary  embryos  (III),  giant  impacts 
including Earth’s Moon-forming event (IV). The long-term evolution phase where secondary 
atmospheres origin (V). The scenarios above the horizontal dashed line illustrate so-called slow 
accretion scenarios where terrestrial planets accrete most of their mass after the disk dissipated. 
The scenario below the dashed-horizontal line corresponds to a two-stage accretion scenario 
according to Jacobsen and Harper (1996), Harper and Jacobsen (1996), and Yu and Jacobsen 
(2011). Here, terrestrial planets accrete faster so that they can capture primordial atmospheres, 
which subsequently escape while the proto-planets accrete their final masses. The shaded zone 
represents the presence of the protoplanetary nebula in the Solar System that dissipated after ≈ 
3.3 – 4.5 Myr (Bollard et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017). In both scenarios, the planets outgas 
steam  atmospheres  when  their  magma  oceans  solidify,  and  secondary  atmospheres  build  up 
later-on due to volcanic outgassing and tectonic activities.  

The past decades have seen much progress in understanding the formation of the terrestrial 

planets. Models that fully explain the formation of terrestrial planets in the inner Solar System 

have to explain how planetesimals grow to ≈ 100 km-scale bodies because of dust coagulation 

(Johansen  et  al.,  2017).  These  planetesimals  then  further  coagulate  into  Mars-mass  or  even 

larger  planetary  embryos,  most  likely  by  planetesimal  accretion  (Kokubo  and  Ida,  1995; 

Kokubo and Ida, 1998). Finally, terrestrial planet formation models that form Venus, Earth and 

Mars must match constraints related to the involved planetary embryos and asteroids, including 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their  orbital  and  compositional  distributions  as  well  as  their  isotope  and  elemental  ratios 

(Morbidelli et al., 2012; Brasser et al., 2017). 

At present, there exists a great variety of terrestrial planet formation models: the Classical 

model (e.g., Wetherill and Stewart, 1989; Chambers, 2001; Raymond et al., 2006; 2009), Grand 

Tack model (e.g., Walsh et al., 2011; Brasser et  al., 2017; 2018, Woo et  al., 2018), annulus 

model (Agnor et al. 1999; Hansen, 2009; Walsh and Levison, 2016), depleted disk model (e.g., 

Izidoro et al., 2014; 2015; Raymond and Izidoro, 2017a) and early instability model (Clement 

et  al.,  2019).  In  contrast,  giant  planet  formation  in  the  solar  system  has  not  been  studied  as 

extensively (Helled et al., 2013). As such, most of the terrestrial planet formation models in the 

literature presuppose that terrestrial and giant planet formation can be treated separately because 

they frequently assume that the giant planets have already formed and reside on their current 

orbits.  Only  the  Grand  Tack  model  includes  the  migration  of  the  giant  planets.  The  models 

listed above tend to study the later stages of terrestrial planet formation, usually focused on the 

giant impact stage (Chambers, 2001) that follows the oligarchic growth phase (Kokubo and Ida, 

1998). However, we would argue that an additional model of terrestrial planet formation can be 

constructed based on pebble accretion (e.g., Ormel and Klahr, 2010; Lambrechts and Johansen, 

2012;  Lambrechts  et  al.,  2014;  Drazkowska  et  al.,  2016).  Even  though  these  studies  focus 

primarily on the formation of planets from a stream of pebbles spiralling through the disc and 

accreting onto a planetary core, Levison et al., (2015b) constructed a model of the formation of 

the terrestial planets from pebble accretion starting from a planetesimal disk and then ran this 

all  the  way  through  the  oligarchic  and  giant  impact  phases.  Their  model  suggests  that  the 

oligarchic and giant impact phases are a natural outcome irrespective of how the planetesimals 

are formed and what they subsequently accrete. The only potential difference is the time scale 

of accretion. 

Here we discuss most of the terrestrial planet formation models in varying degrees of depth 

(Sect. 2). In Sect. 3, we summarise the latest knowledge on terrestrial planet accretion, including 

time scales that are obtained from data based on the isotopic chronometers 182Hf-182W and U-

Pb, lithophile-siderophile elemental isotope data of accreted material, the latest data analysis 

from 48Ca/44Ca isotope samples from planetary building blocks, recent reproduction attempts 

of Venus’ and Earth’s atmospheric 36Ar/38Ar, 20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/22Ne isotope ratios, the evidence 

of solar 3He abundance in Earth’s deep mantle, and the D/H ratio in Earth’s sea water. These 

findings are then compared with the various terrestrial planet formation models. Finally, Sect. 

4 concludes the review.

2.  Terrestrial planet formation models 

2.1 The Classical model for terrestrial planet formation 

Wetherill and Stewart (1989) demonstrated that in a protoplanetary disk consisting of equal-

mass planetesimals, some would undergo rapid collisions with other planetesimals leading to a 

phase  of  runaway  growth  wherein  the  mass  of  the  planet  increases  as  dM/dt  ∝  

M β, where β is a free parameter. When β > 1 runaway growth occurs. In contrast, if β < 1 then 

the accretion is more egalitarian and no specific body will begin to dominate over the others.  

During the earliest stages of planet formation β=4/3 due to effective gravitational focusing 

(Ida & Makino, 1993; Kokubo and Ida, 1996). Here the planetesimals gravitationally stir each 

other  (Ida  and  Makino,  1993),  resulting  in  their  eccentricities  and  inclinations  slowly 

increasing. Once the eccentricities reach orbit-crossing values, the planetesimals will eventually 

collide. Under the assumption of perfect mergers, the formation enters a runaway growth phase 

in  which  the  size-frequency  distribution  of  the  bodies  in  the  disk  becomes  approximately 

bimodal  (Kokubo  and  Ida,  1996).  During  this  phase  the  solids  in  the  disk  consist  of 

approximately lunar- to Mars-sized protoplanets (dubbed planetary embryos) spaced by about 

10 mutual Hill radii, which are embedded in a sea of planetesimals (Kokubo and Ida, 1998). 

The Hill radius of a planet is given by RH=a(mpl/3Mstar)1/3, where a is the semi-major axis, mpl 

and Mstar are the mass of the planet  and the star; the mutual  Hill radius  uses the sum  of the 

masses of two neighbouring planets and the mean of their semi-major axes. During the bimodal 

phase the planetary embryos gravitationally perturb the planetesimals and each other (Kokubo 

and Ida, 1998). If no gas remains from the protoplanetary disk the system would be unstable, 

but if any residual gas remains then the eccentricities and inclinations of all bodies are kept low 

due to damping forces from the gas, and the system is dynamically quasi-stable (Kominami and 

Ida., 2002). The planetary embryos all grow at roughly the same rate as they vie for space and 

for their ability to accrete planetesimals. This phase is called the oligarchic growth stage, and 

approximately half of the solid mass within the disk is in the embryos, with the other half being 

in planetesimals (Kokubo and Ida, 1998). 

The gas density from the solar nebula decreases with time (e.g. Hartmann et al., 1998) so 

that the damping forces from the gas disk on the embryos also weaken with time. There comes 

a  point  in  time  when  gravitational  stirring  overcomes  the  tidal  forces  from  the  gas  disk 

(Kominami  and  Ida,  2002;  2004;  Kominami  et  al.  2005).  By  then,  the  mutual  gravitational 

perturbations from the embryos cause their eccentricities to rise to orbit-crossing values so that 

the whole chain eventually becomes dynamically unstable and the system subsequently evolves 

5 

 
into  a  giant  impact  phase.  Here  planetary  mergers  through  large  impacts  are  commonplace. 

Over  tens  of  millions  of  years  these  mutual  protoplanetary  collisions  eventually  lead  to  the 

observed  terrestrial  planet  inventory  (e.g.  Chambers  and  Wetherill,  1998;  Chambers,  2001; 

Raymond et al., 2006, 2009).  

The so-called Classical model is based on the evolution described above. Due to limitations 

in computing power, however, the runaway growth was extremely difficult to model so that 

simulations of this model began with the Sun being surrounded by a disk of planetesimals and 

protoplanets that are gravitationally interacting (e.g. Raymond et al., 2006). Typical simulations 

of the Classical model assume that the gas from the protoplanetary disk has already dissipated 

(Chambers, 2001), and that Jupiter and Saturn have already formed and reside on their current 

orbits. More recent iterations of invoke the presence of gas from the protoplanetary disk due to 

advances in the theory of planet migration and eccentricity damping (e.g. Tanaka et al., 2002; 

Tanaka and Ward, 2004; Creswell and Nelson, 2008; Paardekooper et al., 2011). In N-body 

simulations of the model, the protoplanets are usually assumed to have the same size and mass; 

the  same  is  true  for  the  planetesimals.  The  surface  density  of  material  typically  has  a  steep 

gradient (typically Σ  ∝ r-3/2) to  match the mass distribution of the planets (Weidenschilling, 

1977).  

Early simulations based on the Classical model of terrestrial planet formation estimates the 

growth time scale of the terrestrial planets to be tens of millions of years. Overall, numerical 

simulations  indicated  that  the  final  terrestrial  system  would  be  assembled  within  100  Myr 

(Chambers, 2001; Raymond et al., 2006; 2009). In most of these early simulations, however, 

the resulting planetary systems were found to suffer from excess eccentricity and inclination of 

the  final  planets,  but  the  inclusion  of  a  large  number  of  planetesimals  –  which  exert  strong 

dynamical friction on the growing planets – alleviated this concern (O'Brien et al., 2006). Still, 

a  chronic  and  fundamental  shortcoming  of  the  Classical  model  remained:  the  output 

systematically  yielded  a  Mars  analogue  that  was  far  too  massive  (e.g.  Chambers,  2001; 

Raymond et al., 2006; 2009). 

2.2 The Grand Tack model 

The problem of Mars' low mass compared to Earth’s has been the focus of several recent 

models  of terrestrial planet  formation.  The most common of these is the Grand Tack model 

(Walsh et al., 2011), which relies on the early, gas-driven radial migration of Jupiter. The idea 

behind the model is that after the gas giant formed it opened an annulus in the gas disk and 

continued migrating towards the Sun (Lin and Papaloizou, 1986) because the torques acting on 

the planet from the protoplanetary disk are imbalanced. At the same time, Walsh et al. (2011) 
6 

 
argue that beyond Jupiter Saturn also accreted its gaseous envelope, albeit more slowly. Once 

Saturn reached some critical mass (as suggested by Walsh et al. (2011) to be 50MEarth, but it 

could be lower) it rapidly migrated Sunwards too, caught up with Jupiter and became trapped 

in  the  2:3  mean  motion  resonance  (Masset  and  Snellgrove,  2001).  This  particular,  and 

fortuitous, configuration of orbital spacing and mass ratio between the gas giants reversed the 

total torque from the gas disk on both planets (Masset and Snellgrove, 2001), thus reversing 

their migration; the planets ‘tacked’, a term from sailing reflecting a change of direction. Pierens 

et al. (2014) showed that outward migration is possible with Jupiter and Saturn in both the 2:3 

and 1:2 resonances (cf. Zhang and Zhou, 2010), but that dynamically stable evolution with little 

migration may also happen i.e. the planets could stall once they are caught in a resonance. Thus, 

the inward-outward migration is a possible outcome, but is not guaranteed, and the amount of 

outward  migration  depends  sensitively  on  the  disk  structure  and  evolution  (D’Angelo  & 

Marzari, 2012). To ensure that Mars did not grow beyond its current mass, the location of the 

‘tack’ of Jupiter was set at 1.5 AU (Walsh et al., 2011). Apart from Mars' low mass compared 

to Earth, the Grand Tack scenario can further account for the semi major axis distribution of 

the terrestrial planets and the stirred demography of the asteroid belt (DeMeo and Carry, 2014; 

Brasser et al., 2019). 

The dynamical consequences of the Grand Tack model on the terrestrial planet region are 

two-fold. First, as Jupiter migrated towards the Sun, it strongly scattered all protoplanets and 

planetesimals in its path due to its high mass. This scattering places more than half of the mass 

of the disk from the inner Solar System to farther than 5 AU from the Sun. Second, Jupiter 

pushed  some  protoplanets  and  planetesimals  towards  the  Sun.  This  shepherding  of  material 

mostly occurred within the 2:1 mean motion resonance with the planet. When Jupiter reversed 

its  migration  at  1.5  AU  it  caused  a  pileup  of  solid  material  within  1  AU.  Thus,  almost  all 

protoplanets and planetesimals that originally formed beyond 1 AU were scattered outwards by 

Jupiter, with a few pushed within 1 AU. This evolution provides a plausible explanation for the 

low amount of mass in the asteroid belt region. 

Figure 2 shows an example of the evolution of a Grand Tack simulation taken from Brasser 

et al. (2016). The top-left panel depicts the initial conditions. Jupiter and Saturn are at 3.5 and 

4.5 AU, respectively. The protoplanetary disk resides between 0.7 AU and 8 AU, interrupted 

by the gas giants. The disk contains planetary embryos of 0.05 Earth masses and two thousand 

planetesimals.  

Closer than 1.5 AU the disk is assumed to consist of material similar to enstatite chondrite 

(EC; green) (Brasser et al., 2017; 2018), while between 1.5 AU and Jupiter the material is akin 

7 

 
to ordinary chondrite (OC; orange). The blue dots correspond to the carbonaceous chondrites 

(CC). Symbol sizes are proportional to their  masses; for Jupiter and Saturn a fixed size was 

chosen so as not to fill most of the panels As the gas giants migrate inwards (top-right panel) a 

significant fraction of OC and CC material is ejected while some OC material is pushed closer 

to the Sun by Jupiter.  

Fig. 2: Snapshots of the evolution of a Grand Tack simulation. The colour coding is green for 
bodies that began closer than 1.5 AU to the Sun, orange for bodies originally between 1.5 AU 
and 3.0 AU and blue for material beyond that. Jupiter and Saturn are depicted as large black 
bullets. The symbol sizes are proportional to the mass of the bodies; for Jupiter and Saturn a 
fixed size was chosen so as not to fill most of the panels. 

After 5 Myr of simulation evolution the gas giants have reversed their migration and stalled 

close to their current positions (bottom-left). They have emptied out the asteroid belt region and 

left behind predominantly EC material in the inner Solar System. Earth and Venus have reached 

approximately half of their masses. By 30 Myr (middle-right) the terrestrial planets are almost 

fully formed and not much happens after 60 Myr of simulation evolution (bottom-left) to 150 

Myr (bottom-right). 

The Classical model and the Grand Tack model predict slightly different outcomes for the 

bulk  compositions  of  the  terrestrial  planets  (Woo  et  al.,  2018).  In  the  Classical  model,  the 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
planets tend to accrete mostly locally.  In contrast, in the Grand Tack model, all the accretion 

is confined to an annulus between approximately 0.5 AU and 1 AU, but this region also contains 

material that originated in the outer parts of the protoplanetary disk that was scattered inwards 

by the migration of Jupiter. Additional contamination of the inner Solar System with material 

from the outer Solar System occurs during the growth of the gas giants (Raymond and Izidoro, 

2017b).  

2.3 Alternative model hypotheses 

We briefly mention several alternative models of terrestrial planet formation, which have 

either  not  (yet)  gained  much  traction  or  are  too  new  to  have  been  thoroughly  explored, 

especially for their cosmochemical implications. The first is the annulus model (Agnor et al., 

1999; Hansen, 2009; Walsh and Levison, 2016), wherein solid material in the disk is confined 

to a narrow region around the Sun, typically between 0.5 AU or 0.7 AU to 1 AU or 1.5 AU. 

The justification for the inner edge of the annulus model is due to the large mass ratio between 

Mercury and Venus; in a similar vein, the justification for the outer edge of the annulus is to 

attempt to reproduce the large mass ratio between Earth and Mars. The rationale for the edges 

is  that a low density of solid material  will hinder the Mercurian and Martian embryos from 

gathering it so that they cannot grow into fully fledged planets such as Venus and Earth.  

The second is the depleted disk model (Izidoro et al., 2014; 2015) wherein the mass of the 

asteroid belt is initially much lower than elsewhere in the protoplanetary disk; a variation of 

this model (Raymond and Izidoro, 2017a) fills the asteroid belt region up with the outwards 

scattering of material from the terrestrial planet formation zone and the inwards scattering of 

material from the giant planet region during giant planet migration. This variation is, in essence, 

no different from the annulus model. In this model, Mars’ small mass compared to Earth’s is 

caused by the density drop of solid material around 1 to 1.5 AU. As such, the Mars analogue 

was unable to accrete much material once the Martian embryo had already mostly grown by 

locally accreting material. The reason for the density drop is left unspoken. 

A  third  model  (Clement  et  al.,  2019)  invokes  a  dynamical  instability  in  the  outer  Solar 

System wherein the giant planets scatter each other and all material around them. There is ample 

evidence that such a dynamical instability has occurred (Thommes et al., 1999; Tsiganis et al., 

2005; Gomes et al., 2005; Morbidelli et al., 2005; Brasser et al., 2009; Morbidelli et al., 2010; 

Levison et  al.,  2011;  Nesvorný and Morbidelli,  2012;  Nesvorný, 2015a, 2015b;  Brasser and 

Lee, 2015), but thus far it has been assumed that this instability happened after terrestrial planet 

formation to account for the late heavy bombardment purported to be recorded by the formation 

of the large lunar impact basins (Tera et al., 1974). In Clement et al. (2019) the authors assume 
9 

 
that this dynamical instability occurred early, while the terrestrial planets were still forming. 

Mars’ low mass is then a result of material in its vicinity being removed by perturbations from 

the  migrating  giant  planets  as  they  evolved  through  a  high-eccentricity  phase.  Based  on 

evidence  from  reset  ages  of  meteorites  for  radiometric  systems  with  different  closure 

temperature Mojzsis et al. (2019) showed that giant planet migration must have commenced 

before  4480 million  years  ago  (Ma),  lending  some  support  to  the  early  instability  model  of 

Clement et al. (2019). 

A fourth variation is the pebble accretion model (Ormel and Klahr, 2010; Lambrechts and 

Johansen, 2012; Johansen and Lambrechts, 2017) wherein Sun-wards-drifting pebbles accrete 

onto large planetesimals or small planetary embryos (Johansen et al. 2015). The high growth 

rate of pebbles compared to planetesimals is due to dissipation of kinetic energy by gas drag as 

a pebble is scattered by a growing protoplanet. These embryos then rapidly grow into either the 

giant planets (Levison et al., 2015a) or the terrestrial planets (Levison et al., 2015b). The radial 

pebble flux through the protoplanetary disc is a key parameter that determines the final masses 

of  the  embryos.  Lambrechts  et  al.  (2019)  demonstrated  that  low  pebble  fluxes  lead  to  the 

formation of Mars-mass embryos that then go on to collide as in the classical terrestrial planet 

formation  picture.  Larger  pebble  fluxes  lead  instead  to  the  formation  of  super-Earths  with 

masses between 1 and 10 times the mass of the Earth. The pebble accretion model is actively 

studied  both  in  the  Solar  System  and  for  exoplanets  (e.g.  Johansen  and  Lambrechts,  2017; 

Matsumura et al., 2017; Izidoro et al., 2019). Furthermore, this model also explores the idea of 

drifting  pebbles  piling  up  in  the  terrestrial  planet  region,  first  forming  planetesimals  and 

subsequently the terrestrial planets (Drazkowska et al., 2016). This model is then a precursor 

for the annulus or depleted disk models. 

2.4 The terrestrial planet formation chart 

A good model of terrestrial planet formation should match a variety of criteria. The criteria that 

we consider here are: fast accretion of mass (< 30 Myr; e.g., Kleine et al., 2002; Yin et al., 2002; 

Yu and Jacobsen, 2011; Kleine and Walker, 2017, and references therein), the mass-semimajor 

axis (M-a relation) distribution of the planets, the low mass of Mars (closely related to the first 

criterion),  the  angular  momentum  deficit  (AMD)  of  the  planets,  the  radial  concentration 

distribution  (Sr),  the  timing  of  the  Moon-forming  event  (Lock  et  al.,  2020,  this  issue),  the 

isotopic composition of the planets, and the lunar and Martian cratering chronology. We have 

composed  a  chart  wherein  we  list  each  of  the  criteria  from  relevant  literature  sources  and 

whether the models listed above match the criteria. When certain  criteria have not  yet  been 

10 

 
tested, we write ‘U’ for ‘Unknown’. Table 1 is filled with the results from the studies listed in 

the previous subsections, as well as those of O’Brien et al. (2006; 2014), Jacobson et al. (2014), 

Brasser  et  al.  (2018,  2020)  and  Woo  et  al.  (2018).  The  criteria  for  success  vary  from  one 

publication to another. Here we have taken the results from literature sources and tallied the 

successes or failures based on what the authors wrote in their respective publications. Where 

unclear,  we  e-mailed  the  authors  with  specific  requests.  An  exhaustive  list  of  individual 

successes and failures is beyond the scope of this work. 

Table 1: Terrestrial planet formation comparison chart related to the different accretion stages 
I, II, III, and IV illustrated in Fig. 1. The criteria and the symbols are explained in the main text. 

We consider the model to work if the success probability for a particular event exceeds 50 % 

in the relevant literature sources (symbol ✔), inconclusive if it falls from 25 % to 50 % (symbol 

~) and a failure if it is below 25 % (symbol ✗). We caution against accepting these results at 

face value because different studies have different criteria for what is considered a successful 

semi-major axis relationship, or a mass threshold for a Mars analogue. This table should be 

considered as indicative only and prompt further investigation into particular aspects of each 

model. 

3.  Terrestrial planet accretion rates constrained by isotopes 

As  briefly  reviewed  above,  planetesimals  and  planetary  embryos  began  to  form  from  solid 

grains originating from the gas and dust in the disk ≈ 4567 Ma (e.g.; Jacobsen, 2003; Bollard 

et  al.  2017).  Planetesimals  then  formed  within  the  first  few  105 years  (Kruijer  et  al.,  2014) 

followed  by  planetary  embryos,  such  as  Mars,  over  the  next  few  million  years  (Dauphas  & 

Pourmand,  2011).  The  terrestrial  planets  subsequently  formed  from  accretion  of  Moon-  and 

Mars-sized planetary embryos that originated at various heliocentric locations. During the past 

decades, the terrestrial planet formation models and scenarios discussed above used different 

accretion  rates,  timing  of  metal-silicate  partitioning,  and  compositions  of  planetary  building 

blocks. However, the before-mentioned different model approaches and parameter spaces that 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are applied by numerous planetary formation modellers (e.g., Morbidelli et al., 2012; Raymond 

et al., 2004; 2009; O`Brien et al., 2006; Johansen et al., 2007;  Izidoro and Raymond, 2018; 

Raymond and Morbidelli, 2020; and references therein), and core formation models (magma 

ocean  model,  two-stage  model,  local  equilibrium  model,  see:  Jacobsen  et  al.,  2008;  and 

references therein) yield different time scales for the formation of large terrestrial planets like 

Earth or Venus that lie within a range of ≤ 30 - 100 Myr. 

Since measurable variations in isotopic ratios of certain elements in terrestrial planets and 

their atmospheres, as well as in meteorites, provide records of accretion, formation of the core 

and crust, we briefly review  the  so-called isotopic chronometers  182Hf-182W and U-Pb  (e.g., 

Jacobsen and Harper, 1996; Yin et al., 2002; Halliday, 2004; Kleine et al., 2004; Rudge et al., 

2010; Jacobsen et al., 2008; Yu and Jacobsen, 2011; Kleine and Walker, 2017), and isotopic 

systems such as 50Ti, 54Cr, 92Mo and 100Ru (e.g., Dauphas, 2017; Brasser et al., 2018; Woo et 

al., 2018; Carlson et al., 2018), 48Ca/44Ca isotope systematics (Schiller et al., 2018), atmospheric 

36Ar/38Ar,  20Ne/22Ne,  36Ar/22Ne ratios (Marty, 2012;  Lammer  et  al.,  2020b), the  evidence of 

solar 3He abundance in Earth’s deep mantle and the D/H ratio in Earth’s sea water,  that can be 

used to constrain the accretion time scales of the terrestrial planets. 

3.1 Radiometric dating systems 

3.1.1 182Hf-182W chronometry for Earth and Mars’ accretion 

The  fractionation  of  gas  and  dust  during  the  stages  of  disk  formation  and  accretion  of 

planetesimals in the solar nebula (< 5 Myr, Bollard et al. 2017) led to a fractionation between 

volatile and refractory elements (e.g., Wai and Wasson, 1977; Jacobsen et al., 2008). At this 

early  time,  Hafnium  (Hf)  and  Tungsten  (W)  isotopes  are  not  significantly  fractionated.  The 

differentiation of planetesimals, planetary embryos and protoplanets, however, leads due to the 

separation of metal-sulphide melt from silicates to the formation of cores resulting in Hf-W 

fractionation (e.g., Jacobsen et al., 2008; Kleine and Walker, 2017). The Hf-W-system therefore 

provides the most reliable radiometric chronometer of core formation for terrestrial planets such 

as the Earth (e.g., Jacobsen and Harper, 1996; Harper and Jacobsen, 1996; Lee and Agee, 1996; 

Halliday and Lee, 1999; Halliday and Lee, 1999; Halliday 2000; Kleine et al., 2002; 2004; Yin 

et al., 2002; Jacobsen et al., 2005; Wood and Halliday, 2005; Jacobsen et al., 2008; Kleine et 

al., 2009; Yu and Jacobsen, 2011; Kleine and Walker, 2017).  

The elements Hf and W are both highly refractory trace elements. Hafnium is a lithophile 

element and strongly partitioned into the silicate portion of a planet, while W is moderately 

siderophile and partitioned preferentially into the coexisting metallic phase. Therefore, ≥ 90 % 

12 

 
of Earth’s W has moved into the core during its formation (Halliday, 2000) (see Fig. 3a), making 

the history of planetary bodies and the timing of accretion, differentiation, and core formation 

a valuable dating technique in planet formation (Kleine et al., 2009). 

Fig.  3:  Panel  a:  The  lithophile  element  182Hf  remains  in  the  mantle  while  the  moderately 
siderophile element 182W moves preferentially into the metallic core. Because 182Hf decays with 
a half-life time of only 9 Myr via 182Ta into 182W these elements represent a precision timer of 
accretion, differentiation, and core formation of terrestrial planets. Panel b: Illustration of the 
essential Hf-W feature (after Halliday, 2000).   

The  basic  principles  of  the  182Hf-182W  chronometry  method  are  briefly  described  below. 

182Hf decays to 182W via 182Ta with a short half-life time of 8.9 Myr. Initially, their parent and 

trace elements should be in chondritic portions ≈ 1 : 1 in the early Solar System bodies because 

both elements are highly refractory (e.g., Jacobsen and Harper, 1996; Halliday and Lee, 1999; 

Halliday 2000; Kleine and Walker, 2017). 

As  mentioned  above  Hf  is  lithophile  and  remains  in  the  mantle  but  W,  which  exists 

preferentially into the metallic phase, sinks into the core. Therefore, the parent-to-daughter ratio 

fHf/W is perturbed by the formation of the core (e.g. Kleine and Walker, 2017; and references 

therein). The residual silicate portion in Earth’s crust and mantle is commonly described as the 

bulk silicate Earth (BSE) and has a fHf/W in the range of ≈10-40 (Newsom et al., 1996). More 

recent studies that correlated W with other refractory lithophile trace elements such as U, Th, 

Ta and Ba (McDonough, 2003; Dauphas and Purmand, 2011; König et al., 2011) indicate that 

fHf/W of the BSE is 18.8 ± 5 (Kleine and Walker, 2017). This value is an order of magnitude 

higher than the chondritic value (see Fig. 3b). If the fractionation of Hf from W caused by core 

formation takes place during the lifetime of 182Hf, an excess 182W relative to other isotopes of 

W should develop in the silicate portion of the planet because of an enhanced fHf/W as illustrated 

in Fig. 3b.  

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By using 182Hf-182W chronometry and the ratio fHf/W one can now constrain the rate of Earth’s 

accretion and the timing of core formation by geochemical models. Several Moon- to Mars-

mass planetary embryo impactors released enough energy that proto-Earth produced temporary 

magma oceans so that core formation could take place (e.g., Rubie et al., 2007). 

The segregation of metal and hence core formation occurs within the early magma ocean 

state with a metal-silicate equilibrium at very high pressure and temperature (e.g., Rubie et al., 

2003; Jacobsen et al. 2003; Kleine and Walker, 2017). Core formation models assume that the 

terrestrial planets accrete dust and planetesimals with a chondritic Hf/W ratio related to an Hf 

and W-isotopic composition. Jacobsen and Harper (1996) suggested a model that assumes local 

equilibrium  at  which  the  newly  added  material  to  the  growing  protoplanet  immediately 

differentiates into metal and silicate, with the metal sinking to the core without equilibrating 

with the remaining silicate mantle. However, this local equilibrium model results in a very long 

mean-time for Earth’s core formation of ≈ 108 Myr (≈ 4460 Ma) with a 90 % core-formation 

time of the order of ≈ 250 Myr (≈ 4318 Ma) (Jacobsen and Harper, 1996; Jacobsen et al., 2008). 

A reason for this long time-scale is that the newly segregated core material in this model reflects 

only the average isotopic composition of the delivered material.  

This long core formation mean-time is also not in agreement with the strong evidence for an 

early  silicate  differentiation  at  ≈ 4530 Myr  ago  from  measured  143Nd/144Nd  and  142Nd/144Nd 

ratios  of  the  3800  Myr  ago  supracrustal  rocks  of  Isua  from  West  Greenland  (Harper  and 

Jacobsen, 1992; Jacobsen and Harper, 1996; Boyet et al., 2003; Caro et al., 2003; Boyet and 

Carlson,  2005;  Bennet  et  al.,  2007;  Jacobsen  et  al.,  2008).  These  findings  let  to  a  general 

consensus that the related Sm-Nd-systematics as fractionation of Sm/Nd taking place within 

the first 100 Myr after the origin of the Solar System, i.e. before 4468 Ma. This would also 

indicate that the Moon-forming event, which led to the last magma ocean, occurred within the 

first 100 Myr (e.g. Touboul et al., 2007; Asphaug, 2014; Lock et al., 2020, this issue). 

Lee and Agee (1996) developed a so-called metal pond core formation model, where the 

authors assumed that the newly segregated material is equilibrated at the bottom of the magma 

ocean at roughly 1000 km. Harper and Jacobsen (1996) and Jacobsen (2005) developed the so-

called magma ocean differentiation model, where the newly segregated core material reflects 

the  average  isotopic  composition  of  the  silicate  mantle  due  to  full  equilibrium  in  a  magma 

ocean. Today, the magma ocean model is the most widely used core formation model related 

to the interpretation of early Earth’s Hf-W-chronometry studies (e.g., Yin et al., 2002; Wood 

and Halliday, 2005; Jacobsen et al., 2008; Kleine et al., 2009; Yu and Jacobsen, 2011; Kleine 

and  Walker,  2017).  Two-stage  accretion  scenarios  yield  results  between  the  magma  ocean 

14 

 
model with complete equilibration between metal and silicates and the local equilibrium model 

(e.g., Jacobsen et al. 2008; references therein). 

Experimental work and model results indicate that the primitive mantle abundances of the 

moderately siderophile elements Fe, Ni, Co, Mo, W, P, the moderately siderophile element Ge 

and the highly siderophile element Re are consistent with a so-called metal-silicate equilibrium 

at the base of a 700 to 1000 km deep magma ocean in the early Earth, and hence a homogeneous 

accretion (Righter and Drake, 2000; Righter et al., 2011). During the stage of planetary embryo 

formation  surface  temperatures  can  reach  up  to  2000  -  3000  K  (Ikoma  and  Genda,  2006; 

Bouhifd and Jephcoat, 2011; Stökl et al., 2016), so that deep magma oceans would have been 

present (Lammer et al., 2020a, this issue; 2020b). 

By assuming complete metal-silicate equilibrium the Hf-W systematics yield a fast accretion 

of the main mass of Earth within 10 Myr (Wade and Wood, 2005; Cogne et al., 2008; Jacobsen 

et  al.,  2008).  The  Moon-forming  event,  however,  finished  Earth’s  main  phase  of  accretion 

between ≥30 Myr (e.g., Jacobsen, 2005; Albarède, 2009; Barboni et al., 2017; Thiemens et al., 

2019) to ≈ 100 Myr (e.g., Halliday, 2008; Halliday and Wood, 2009; Boyet and Carlson, 2005; 

Connelly et al. 2019) i.e. between 4538 Myr and 4468 Myr ago. Metal segregation happens 

faster than accretion (Jacobsen and Harper, 1996; Jacobsen et al., 2008, and references therein), 

so that the time scale of core formation  is  generally used to  constrain  Earth’s accretion rate 

(e.g.,  Rudge  et  al.,  2010;  Yu  and  Jacobsen,  2011;  Kleine  and  Walker,  2017;  and  references 

therein). Equilibrium two-stage model results for Hf-W systematics agree with accretion ages 

of ≈ 31.0 ± 4.4 Myr (Rudge et al., 2010; Kleine and Walker, 2017), meaning that core formation 

was established by 4537 ± 4.4 Myr ago. 

According to these studies, the 182Hf-182W chronometry method indicates that at least 80 % 

of  the  early  Earth  must  have  accreted  in  ≤  35  Myr,  while  the  final  ≈10  %  must  have  been 

accreted  by  120  Myr.  In  partial  metal-silicate  equilibrium  models,  proto-Earth  would  have 

accreted ≈ 0.63 MEarth after a duration of some 10 - 25 Myr (Jacobsen et al., 2008; Mamajek, 

2009; Rudge et al., 2010; Kleine and Walker, 2017; Morbidelli, 2018). 

Yu and Jacobsen (2011) showed that one could overcome discrepancies mainly explained 

by  metal-silicate  disequilibrium  during  giant  impacts  in  Hf-W  systematics  by  including 

constraints from partitioning of refractory siderophile elements Ni, Co, W, V, and Nb during 

core formation. These authors found that the concentrations of the siderophile elements in the 

mantle  are  consistent  with  high-pressure  metal-silicate  equilibration  in  a  terrestrial  magma 

ocean (Righter and Drake, 2000; Righter et al., 2011). In this study, the earliest time the Moon-

forming event could have taken place is at roughly 30 Myr after the origin of the Solar System. 

15 

 
Under these assumptions, the model of Yu and Jacobsen (2011) indicate that the timing of the 

Moon-forming event is inversely correlated with the time scale of Earth’s main accretion stage 

of the first 0.87 MEarth. 

If the Moon-forming giant impact occurred later than 50 Myr (i.e. after 4510 Myr ago), the 

main stage of early Earth’s accretion would need to have occurred before < 10.7 ± 2.5 Myr, 

while  an  earlier  Moon-forming  event  would  increase  the  time  taken  for  Earth’s  primary 

accretion (Yu and Jacobsen, 2011). To summarise, the evidence for Earth’s (terrestrial planet) 

accretion from  182Hf-182W chronometry within its uncertainties results in a time scale for the 

main mass accretion of 8.2 - 35 Myr and proto-Earth masses at the time when the disk dissipated 

at 3.5 – 4 Myr (Bollard et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017) of  0.5 – 0.75 MEarth, if one assumes full 

metal-silicate equilibrium (Yin et al., 2002; Jacobsen et al., 2008; Rudge et al., 2010; Yu and 

Jacobsen, 2011; Kleine and Walker 2017). Yu and Jacobsen (2011) obtain a mass for proto-

Earth at roughly 4 Myr that is of the order of 0.56 MEarth with a Hf/W ratio of ≈ 15 and a late 

giant Moon-forming impact ≥ 52 Myr (i.e. after 4510 Myr ago). 

As was shown in Lammer et al. (2020a, this issue; 2020b), if proto-Earth accreted in excess 

of > 0.58 MEarth during the lifetime of the solar nebula, the present-day atmospheric 36Ar/38Ar, 

20Ne/22Ne and 36Ar/22Ne ratios (see also Sect. 3.1.4) cannot be reproduced through EUV-driven 

hydrodynamic escape of a thin primordial atmosphere. Moreover, these authors also show that 

if  the  proto-Earth  accreted  >  0.7  MEarth  during  the  disk  lifetime  (≈  4  Myr),  it  would  need 

hundreds of Myr or even Gyrs to lose its primordial atmosphere. One can therefore conclude 

that the upper mass of proto-Earth at 4.0 Myr, i.e. the time when the disk dissipated, should 

have been ≤ 0.58 MEarth (Lammer et al., 2020b). 

The analysis of 182Hf-182W chronometry for dating Mars’ accretion is more complex because 

one cannot measure the Hf/W ratio of bulk silicate Mars (Kleine and Walker, 2017). In Mars’ 

case one must compare the abundance of W to other lithophile elements that have the same 

incompatibility as W. If one assumes that refractory elements such as U, Th, Hf and W occur 

in chondritic relative portions in bulk Mars, than Hf/W of bulk silicate Mars can be estimated 

from U/W × chondritic Hf/U or Th/W × chondritic Hf/Th of Martian rock samples (Dauphas 

and  Pourmand,  2011).  By  using  this  assumption,  two-stage  accretion  models  yield  a  core 

formation age for Mars of 4.1±2.7 Myr, while exponential growth models for Mars yield  ≈ 63 

% accreted mass at roughly 2.4 Myr and up to ≤ 10 Myr for the remainder of Mars’ accretion 

(Dauphas and Pourmand, 2011; Kleine and Walker, 2017). Using 60Fe-60Ni chronometry, Tang 

and Dauphas (2014) independently obtained the same accretion time scale. Thus, one can say 

16 

 
that Mars was almost fully formed when the disk dispersed after 3.3 – 4.5 Myr (Bollard et al., 

2017; Wang et al., 2017).  

3.1.2 Uranium-lead (U-Pb) isotopic dating system 

The U-Pb dating system is one of the earliest radiometric dating schemes that was used for 

dating rocks that crystallised between millions of years to over 4500 Ma (e.g., McDonough and 

Sun, 1995; Kellogg et al., 2007; Jacobsen et al., 2008; Schaltegger et al., 2015). Because the 

exact rate at which U decays into Pb is well known, the current ratio of Pb to U in a rock sample 

can be used to determine its age, provided that in the interim no Pb loss occurred. The U-Pb 

dating system relies on two separate isotope decay chains: the first one is from  238U to 206Pb, 

with a half life of 4.47 Gyr, while the second decay chain begins at 235U which decays to 207Pb 

with a half life of 710 Myr. U-Pb systematics applied to Earth’s mantle suggest that the time it 

takes for the Earth to grow to ≈ 0.63 MEarth is 56 – 130 Myr for an equilibrium two-stage model, 

and 21.5 – 51 Myr for an exponential growth model (Rudge et al., 2010).  

Compared to 182Hf-182W systematics of Earth’s mantle discussed above, U-Pb systematics 

yield accretion time scales that are much longer (e.g., Halliday, 2004; Kleine et al., 2004; Rudge 

et  al.,  2010;  Kleine  and  Walker,  2017).  Because  U-Pb  chronometers  are  long-lived 

chronometers that are susceptible to geological processes throughout Earth’s history, as well as 

at  its  beginning,  this  method  does  not  give  as  strong  an  accretion  constraint  as  the  Hf-W 

chronometer (Jacobsen et al., 2008; Kleine and Walker, 2017; and references therein). 

The  blanketing  effect  of  the  H2/He-dominated  primordial  atmosphere  that  surrounded 

growing  protoplanets  during  and,  depending  on  their  mass,  also  some  time  after  the  disk 

lifetime,  as  well  as  collisions  between  Moon-  to  Mars-mass  planetary  embryos  that  were 

involved in the growth of proto-Earth and Venus, released enough energy to produce a global 

magma ocean  (e.g., Jacobsen et  al.,  2008; Lammer et  al.,  2020a, this issue;  2020b), so  core 

formation as discussed before started much earlier than estimated by the U-Pb chronology (e.g., 

Rubie et al., 2007; Kleine and Walker, 2017). Due to this discrepancy, Kamper and Kramers 

(2006)  and  Yin  and  Jacobsen  (2006)  suggested  that  U-Pb  systematics  do  not  constrain  core 

formation since bulk Earth’s U/Pb ratio and the Pb isotopic composition are not known well 

enough. Moreover, the discrepancy in accretion time scales related to U-Pb systematics may be 

caused by a late segregation of Pb-bearing sulphides into Earth’s core (Wood and Halliday, 

2005;  Halliday  and  Wood,  2007),  disequilibrium  during  core  formation  (Halliday,  2004; 

Allègre et al., 2008), and the possible addition of Pb during the late veneer (Albarède, 2009). 

To summarise this brief discussion: according to Rudge et al. (2010) and Kleine and Walker 

17 

 
(2017), one can conclude that U-Pb systems contain little information on the early accretion, 

but constrain Earth’s late accretion phase very well. 

However, the main uncertainties between Hf-W and U-Pb systematics for the determination 

of the core formation time-scale is the strong dependence on the metal-silicate equilibrium (e.g., 

Kleine et al., 2002; Allègre et al., 2008) and the uncertainties in knowledge related to the bulk 

Earth  Pb  isotopic  composition  and  U/Pb  ratio  (e.g.,  Yin  and  Jacobsen,  2006).  Rudge  et  al. 

(2010)  showed  that  Hf-W  constrains  the  early  phase  of  accretion,  while  the  U-Pb  system 

constrains the late stage of accretion but contains little information on Earth’s early  growth. 

One can bring the Hf-W and U-Pb age  determinations into agreement  if  one assumes a  full 

metal-silicate equilibrium combined with a very fast early accretion that subsequently slowed 

down and was  followed by a long  phase of much slower  growth culminating  in  a late giant 

impact, i.e., the Moon-forming event (Rudge et al., 2010; Yu and Jacobsen, 2011).  

Moreover, Kellogg et al. (2007) showed that a mean age of accretion and core formation of 

≈ 10 Myr is consistent with the isotopic composition of modern mid-ocean ridge basalts when 

taking into account recycling of continental and oceanic crusts into the mantle over time. This 

result agrees  with  the study of Rudge et  al.  (2010) that there is no need to  infer a late  core 

formation to explain Earth’s Pb isotopic composition. According to Jacobsen et al. (2008) it 

seems that the fractionation of U-Pb in the nebula is, a dominant process so that the core-related 

fractionation  has  to  be  very  accurately  determined  compared  with  the  volatile-related 

fractionation in order to obtain accurate results for the timing of core formation based on the 

U-Pb-system. Therefore, the U-Pd-isotopic dating system does not place strong constraints on 

the chronology of accretion and core formation. 

3.2 Constrains from lithophile-siderophile isotope data, 48Ca/44Ca-systematics  

and noble gases  

3.2.1 Earth’s accretion constrained by lithophile-siderophile elements 

For  decades,  researchers  have  tried  to  estimate  Earth’s  bulk  chemical  composition  by 

comparison  with  meteorites. Clayton et al.  (1970) found that Earth’s oxygen composition  is 

different compared to most meteorites apart from the silicon-rich and highly reduced enstatite 

chondrites.  However,  the  chemical  composition  of  enstatite  chondrites  is  very  different 

compared to  rocks  on Earth’s surface  (e.g., Drake and Righter, 2002;  Carlson 2017), so  the 

community  continued  to  assume  that  the  more  oxidised  and  volatile-rich  carbonaceous 

chondrites were involved in early Earth’s accretion. 

18 

 
 
 
Recently Dauphas (2017) used the unique isotope content of different types of meteorites to 

identify those that could have been involved in Earth’s accretion over time. He calculated that 

the isotopic mantle signatures of lithophile elements such as O, Ca, Ti and Nd, and moderate to 

highly siderophile elements like Cr, Ni, Mo and Ru recorded different accretion stages of the 

early Earth. Dauphas  (2017) showed that these  elements point to  a large fraction of Earth’s 

building blocks, some 70%, that were isotopically similar to enstatite meteorites. It was found 

that  for  the  first  60%  of  its  accretion,  proto-Earth  most  likely  formed  from  a  mixture  of  an 

isotopic  composition  of  51%  enstatite,  40  %  ordinary  chondrites  and  9  %  carbonaceous 

chondrites (i.e.  5.4% CC in total). For the second accretion stage, i.e. the next  60 – 99.5% of 

Earth’s mass, and for the final 0.5% accreted during the late veneer, the isotopic record of these 

elements are mainly akin to enstatite chondrite-like material. 

At  the  same  time,  Fischer-Gödde  and  Kleine  (2017)  concluded  from  Ru  isotopic 

measurements from a sample of meteorites that material arriving as late accretion was relatively 

dry and isotopically identical to enstatite chondrites. This finding is also in support of Dauphas 

(2017) that states enstatite chondrites most likely played an important role in the accretion of 

the Solar System’s terrestrial planets, although in an earlier study Zhang & Becker (2013) state 

that S, Se and Te abundance in the terrestrial mantle requires a volatile-rich late veneer. Carlson 

et al (2018) conclude that the composition of the planetary building blocks changes over time 

and Earth’s deep interior should have a different composition compared to its surface layers. 

However, the findings and three-stage accretion model presented by Dauphas (2017) neither 

gives a time scale for the two main accretion stages nor describes how much mass was accreted 

while the planet was embedded within the disk or after its dispersal. 

3.2.2 Accretion rates of inner disk mass versus time obtained from 48Ca/44Ca isotope data 

Current  models  that  study  the  formation  of  planetary  embryos  from  dust  settling  to 

planetesimal formation via pebbles (that originate from the same flow) struggle to explain the 

different compositions of Solar System bodies (e.g., Johansen et al., 2015; Morbidelli, 2018). 

Schiller  et  al.  (2018)  measured  the  48Ca/44Ca  isotope  content  in  samples  from  Earth,  Mars, 

Vesta, and the angrite and ureilite parent bodies. Here, µ48Ca corresponds to the 48Ca/44Ca ratio 

relative to that in the terrestrial reference standard, given in parts per million (p.p.m.). A positive 

correlation between  48Ca/44Ca isotope ratios and planetary masses was identified. To explain 

these findings, a highly debated and unorthodox view of planetary growth is proposed by these 

authors. Schiller et al. (2018) suggest that pebble accretion is correct, however, the different 

bodies were growing at the same rate but stopped growing at different times (Schiller et al., 

19 

 
 
2018; Morbidelli, 2018). This hypothesis is non-conventional because the mainstream theory 

is that bodies of different masses and at different locations grew at different rates during the 

lifetime  of  the  disk.  Fig.  4  illustrates  their  hypothesis  of  planetary  accretion.  In  the  model 

approach  of  Schiller  et  al.  (2018),  the  gas  and  dust  in  the  disk  surrounding  the  young  Sun 

initially contained inner-disk material with low µ48Ca ≈ -150 ppm, similar to the ureilites, and 

outer disk particles with high µ48Ca values of ≈ +200 ppm, which corresponds to carbonaceous 

chondrites. 

In this scenario, the planetesimals and planetary embryos grew by accreting matter from the 

inner disk. The inner disk started to be fed with inwards-drifting pebbles and, after some time, 

the inner-disk material was largely supplemented by the material from the outer disk, resulting 

in an increase of the mean µ48Ca value of the inner disk. The planetary embryos continued to 

grow until they were displaced by perturbations from other bodies. The assumed µ48Ca mixing 

from the inner and outer material resulted in values of µ48Ca ≈ -100 p.p.m. for Vesta, ≈ -20 

p.p.m for Mars and 0 p.p.m. for Earth and the Moon. From their analysis, the authors conclude 

that proto-Earth grew to ≈ 0.8 MEarth within the disk lifetime and its accreted material consisted 

of ≈ 60 % Ureilite and ≈ 40% CI-chondrite-like material (which are the end-members of the 

model).  This  rapid  accretion  is  difficult  to  reconcile  with  current  dynamical  and  Hf-W 

chronometry models (e.g. Carlson et al., 2018; Yu and Jacobson, 2011). 

In a brief report, Morbidelli (2018) remarked various inconsistencies within the hypothesis 

proposed by Schiller et al. (2018). One problem is that, for the Earth, the model of Schiller et 

al.  (2018) requires  about  0.4  MEarth  to  be accreted from  the outer disk,  which is  higher than 

previous calculations by Dauphas (2017) and Morbidelli et al. (2016). However, the previously 

mentioned studies did not include ureilite-like material in their models because of the inability 

from the existing samples of the Ureilites and other achondrites to obtain the bulk elemental 

concentrations of the parent body that the models require. 

The  added  outer  Solar  System  material  is  represented  isotopically  in  Ca  ratios  of  CI 

chondrites (Schiller et al., 2018). The composition of the proto-Earth as inferred by Schiller et 

al. (2018) is not in agreement with the isotope measurements of the lithophile, moderately and 

highly siderophile elements of the material out of which Earth’s mantle accreted, as determined 

by Dauphas (2017), since it does not include a high amount of enstatite material (see also Sect. 

3.1.2) because Schiller et al. (2018) focused on an end-member model only. Furthermore, it is 

unlikely that a terrestrial mantle consisting of 40% CI chondrite is consistent with the terrestrial 

Mg/Si elemental ratio as well as with oxygen, titanium, chromium and other isotopic systems. 

Recently, Schiller et al. (2020) claim that terrestrial Fe isotopes are nearly identical to those of 

20 

 
CI chondrites. From their measurements they imply that the terrestrial mantle consists of 40% 

CI. It is clear that further studies are needed to resolve this dilemma.  

Fig. 4: Illustration of the hypothesis suggested by Schiller et al. (2018) for the accretion of 
Venus,  Earth  and  Mars  based  on  measured  48Ca/44Ca  isotope  ratios  (µ  48Ca  [p.p.m.])  that 
correlate between the masses of the inner Solar System bodies.  The times indicate accretion 
stages during the disk’s lifetime in which various bodies originated. In this scenario, the parent 
bodies  of  Ureilite-type  meteorites,  the  asteroid  Vesta,  Mars  and  planetary  embryos  that 
probably formed Earth are also shown (from Morbidelli, 2018). 

From atmospheric 20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/38Ar and 36Ar/22Ne reproduction attempts, Lammer et al. 

(2020b)  concluded  that  protoplanets  that  accreted  masses  of  >  0.58  MEarth  within  the  disk 

lifetime of 3.3 – 4.5 Myr (Bollard et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017) would capture a primordial 

atmosphere that is  too  massive  to  be consistent with  the present  atmospheric ratios,  while a 

proto-Earth with a mass of ≥ 0.7 MEarth at 4 Myr likely ends up as a gas dwarf (e.g., Owen and 

Wu, 2016; Fossati et al., 2017; see also Lammer et al. 2020a; this issue).  

As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to reproduce the present-day atmospheric Ar and Ne noble 

gas  ratios  of  the  Earth  with  a  composition  as  suggested  by  Schiller  et  al.  (2018)  but  not  by 

growing up to 80% of its mass within the nebula (that dispersed at 3.3 – 4.5 Myr). In such a 

case proto-Earth accretes up to ≈ 0.53 – 0.58 MEarth within the gas disk and grows fast up to ≥ 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.8  MEarth  immediately  afterwards  and  still  before  the  escape  of  a  tiny  captured  primordial 

atmosphere (within < 7 Myr) through planetesimal accretion. Afterwards mainly CCs or CIs – 

as suggested by Schiller et  al.  (2018)  – that are  depleted in  the noble gases  and moderately 

volatile  elements  finalised  Earth’s  accretion.  In  such  a  case,  the  process  after  disk  dispersal 

would  be  a  complex  interplay  between  EUV-driven  hydrodynamic  and  impact-induced 

atmospheric escape combined with mass accretion. Such a fast accretion scenario also fits with 

the Hf-W chronometry for fHf/W ≈ 15, if full metal-silicate equilibrium is assumed (Rudge et al., 

2010; Yu and Jacobsen, 2011; Kleine and Walker, 2017) (see also Sect. 3.1.1). 

To conclude, the controversial hypothesis of Schiller et al. (2018) may give some answers 

as  to  why  different  Solar  System  bodies  have  varying  compositions  if  they  grew  from  the 

accretion  of  the  same  flow  of  pebbles  (cf.  Morbidelli,  2018),  but  it  neither  agrees  with  the 

isotopic  nature  of  Earth’s  accreting  material,  as  inferred  by  Dauphas  (2017),  (see  also  Sect. 

3.2.1) nor are the implications clear for other isotopic systems and for the elemental abundances 

within the Earth. Future research will have to show how the µ48Ca isotope data connects with 

the  other  isotopical,  chemical,  chronological  and  dynamical  constraints  of  terrestrial  planet 

formation. 

3.2.3 Constraining early Earth’s and Venus’ accretion by reproducing their atmospheric 

36Ar/38Ar, 20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/22Ne isotope ratios 

Besides the before mentioned dating methods, 36Ar/38Ar, 20Ne/22Ne and 36Ar/22Ne noble gas 

isotope ratios  in  Earth’s  and Venus’  atmospheres also  provide important  information  on the 

origin and evolution of these planets (e.g. Pepin, 1991; 1997; Gillmann et al., 2009; Odert et 

al., 2018; Lammer at al., 2020a, this issue; Lammer et al., 2020b). Previous studies (e.g., Pepin 

1991; 1997; Gillmann et al., 2009; Odert et al., 2018) that have tried to reproduce the present 

atmospheric isotope ratios of these noble gases during the past-applied arbitrary assumptions 

related to the EUV flux of the young Sun, simple atmospheric escape models and initial H2-

rich reservoirs related to primordial and steam atmospheres. 

Marty (2012) analysed the Ar and Ne abundances in the present atmosphere of the Earth and 

found that the ratios of today’s atmosphere and concentrations of water, carbon and nitrogen 

indicate a volatile content equivalent to ≈ 98% non-chondritic depleted/dry proto-Earth with 

only  ≈  2%  contribution  of  carbonaceous  chondritic  material.  As  discussed  above,  Dauphas 

(2017) analysed isotopic signatures of lithophile, moderately siderophile and highly siderophile 

elements from Earth’s mantle material and concluded that roughly 5% carbonaceous chondritic 

material was involved in early Earth’s accretion. As discussed above, more recently, Schiller et 

22 

 
 
al. (2018) inferred from the analysis of 48Ca/44Ca isotope ratios in various early Solar System 

objects, that proto-Earth accreted roughly 40% carbonaceous chondrites (mainly CI chondrites) 

at  the  time  when  the  disk  dissipated.  This  value  is  roughly  comparable  to  that  obtained  by 

Warren (2011), who uses the lever method to obtain ≈ 24 - 32 %. In the case that proto-Earth 

accreted higher amounts of carbonaceous chondritic material compared to the 2% inferred from 

today’s  data  (Marty,  2012),  thermal  processing  in  a  possible  primordial  atmosphere  and 

atmospheric escape from accreting planetary embryos and the growing protoplanet could have 

been depleted in these volatile elements (Odert et al., 2018; Benedikt et al., 2019; Young et al., 

2019; Lammer et al., 2020a, this issue; 2020b), altering the bulk and isotopic composition.  

Recently,  Lammer  et  al.  (2020b)  reproduced  Earth’s  present  atmospheric  36Ar/38Ar, 

20Ne/22Ne  and  36Ar/22Ne  noble  gas  isotope  ratios  within  realistic  young  Sun  and  initial  H2-

reservoir  conditions  by  applying  a  sequence  of  sophisticated  impact  and  upper  atmosphere 

escape models. 

accumulate around protoplanets with different masses during the accretion in the disk phase. 

They applied a hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model for the escape calculation of possible 

H2-envelopes that remained during disk dispersal on various protoplanetary masses, including 

impact  erosion,  delivery,  and  composition/ratio  modifications.  The  atmosphere  evolution 

studies were carried out by including the young Sun’s EUV flux constrained by an activity-

rotation relation of young solar-like stars according to Tu et al. (2015). 

Finally,  Lammer  et  al.  (2020b)  could  reproduce  Earth’s  present  36Ar/38Ar,  20Ne/22Ne  and 

36Ar/22Ne  and  Venus’  36Ar/38Ar,  20Ne/22Ne  noble  gas  ratios  within  the  uncertainties  of  the 

parameter space, when proto-Venus and proto-Earth grew to masses of up to 0.68 - 0.81MEarth 

and 0.53 – 0.58 MEarth, respectively, at 4 Myr when the disk dissipated. 

In early Earth’s case, today’s atmospheric 36Ar/22Ne ratio of 18.8 (Marty and Allé, 1994; Marty, 

2012) can be best reproduced by Lammer et al. (2020a; 2020b) if the post-nebula impactors 

(0.15 – 0.3 MEarth) contain roughly 5% carbonaceous chondritic material  (see Fig. 5; dashed 

lines) if one assumes an initial composition as suggested by Dauphas (2017), and ≥ 70% (see 

Fig. 5; solid lines) if they assume the composition as expected by Schiller et al. (2018). 

The 95 % and ≤ 30 % of the accreted post-nebula material has to be depleted in the studied 

elements and hence originates from volatile-poor material. 

These authors studied the boil-off phase of primordial H2-dominated atmospheres that  

Figure 5 shows reproduction attempts of Earth’s present atmospheric Ar and Ne noble gas 

ratios when the proto-Earth was 0.55MEarth when the disk dissipated at 4 Myr. In such a case, a 

23 

 
tiny primordial H2-dominated atmosphere with a mass fraction of 0.0035 %  MEarth remained 

after the boil-off phase during disk dispersal (Lammer et al., 2020a, this issue; 2020b). 

Fig. 5: Evolution scenario that reproduces present Earth’s atmospheric  20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/38Ar 
and 36Ar/22Ne ratios and the corresponding early mass accretion of proto-Earth as modelled 
by Lammer et al. (2020a) with a proto-Earth-mass at 4 Myr of 0.55 MEarth, a small captured 
H2-dominated primordial atmosphere that is lost within < 7 Myr after the origin of the Solar 
System, and ≈ 3 Myr after disk dispersal due to impact erosion and EUV-driven hydrodynamic 
escape  related  to  a  young  Sun  that  rotates  slower  than  a  moderate  rotator.  Case  1: 
Reproduction of Earth’s atmospheric 20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/38Ar and 36Ar/22Ne ratios if one assumes 
the initial composition given in Dauphas (2017), but with a CC contribution of about 5 % after 
a tiny primordial atmosphere escaped (see also  Sect. 3.2.1) with a contribution of ≈ 5% of 
carbonaceous chondrites. Case 2: Reproduction of Earth’s atmospheric 20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/38Ar 
and  36Ar/22Ne ratios by assuming the initial composition suggested by Schiller et al. (2018) 
(see also Sect. 3.2.2) with a contribution of ≈ 40% of carbonaceous chondrites. The chondritic 
post-H2-envelope impactors are depleted in  70%  and 30% in  Ne and Ar,  respectively.  The 
corresponding accretion scenario  agrees well  with  that of Yu and Jacobsen (2011) that the 
main stage of Earth’s accretion of ≈ 0.87 MEarth was completed rapidly within 10.7 ± 2.5 Myr, 
corresponding to  a Hf-W determined Moon giant impact time  tMGI  at ≈ 53 Myr after Solar 
System formation (black solid line). (after Lammer et al., 2020a)

The growing proto-Earth lost this tiny primordial atmosphere during ≤ 3 Myr afterward by 

impact erosion and EUV-driven hydrodynamic escape of H atoms that drag and fractionate the 

Ar and Ne isotopes. 

In Venus’ case, the reproduction of its atmospheric 36Ar/38Ar and 20Ne/22Ne isotope ratios is 

more uncertain due to the large error bars of the available measurements of previous spacecraft. 

According to Lammer et al. (2020b) Venus’ present atmospheric Ar and Ne isotope ratios can 

be reproduced if it captured a primordial atmosphere that corresponds to a mass for proto-Venus 

of ≈ 0.83 – 1 MVenus at the time when the disk dissipated. If this were the case then this would 

indicate that Venus accreted faster than Earth. As pointed out by Dandouras et al. (2020, this 

issue), future Venus missions that will precisely re-measure the atmospheric noble gas ratios 

are necessary to constrain the initial composition and evolution of Venus. 

3.2.4 Constraining early Earth’s accretion by 3He, and 20Ne/22Ne, isotope data 

from the deep mantle 

The question of whether the growing  proto-Earth was  surrounded by at  least  a  low-mass 

primordial atmosphere has long been debated (e.g., Hayashi et al., 1979; Mizuno et al., 1980; 

Jacobsen and Harper, 1996; Harper and Jacobsen, 1996; Porcelli et al., 2001; Dauphas, 2003; 

Yokochi and Marty, 2004; Jacobsen et al., 2008; Raquin and Moreira, 2009; Hallis et al., 2015; 

Jaupart et al., 2017; Péron et al., 2018; Williams and Mukhopadhyay, 2019). That early Earth 

most  likely  accreted  partially  before  and  after  the  nebular  disk  dispersed  was  discussed  by 

Harper and Jacobsen (1996), who studied the abundance of 3He and the before mentioned Ne 

isotopes in the mantle. In such a two-stage accretion scenario hypothesis, proto-Earth accreted 

enough  mass  during  the  disk  lifetime  to  attract  a  H2-He-dominated  primordial  atmosphere 

directly from the nebular gas. For explaining the evidence of the solar-like Ne and He noble gas 

abundances,  as  well  as  the  presence  of  a  large  129Xe  excess  in  the  deep  Earth,  Harper  and 

Jacobsen (1996) and Jacobsen et al. (2008) suggest, that these elements were embedded in the 

solar-like  H2-He-dominated  primordial  atmosphere,  dissolved  in  the  magma  ocean  and 

transported into the deep Earth. Additionally, planetesimals and dust continuously added noble 

gas components into the growing protoplanet. Although, the presence of a large 129Xe excess, 

produced in the deep mantle due to a fast radioactive decay of 129I with a half-life of 15.7 Myr, 

is consistent with a very early atmosphere (Jacobsen and Harper, 1996; Jacobsen et al., 2008; 

Caracausi et al., 2016; Avice et al., 2017), the initially produced 129Xe is contaminated by Xe 

isotopes that were delivered during the late veneer. A detailed discussion on Xe isotopes and 

25 

 
 
 
their perspectives on atmospheric evolution on Earth, Venus and Mars can be found in Avice 

and Marty (2020, this issue).  

According to  Harper and Jacobsen (1996), the  inferred  3He abundance from deep-mantle 

plumes  of  Hawaiian  volcanos  (e.g.,  Poreda  and  Craig,  1992;  Harper  and  Jacobsen,  1996; 

Timmerman et al., 2019) is more or less comparable to the abundance observed in primitive 

carbonaceous chondrites (e.g., Mazor et al., 1970; Kellogg and Wasserburg, 1990), but is much 

higher compared to all the other highly volatile elements in the deep Earth. This evidence is 

thought  to  be  a  primitive  un-degassed  reservoir  that  was  preserved  from  the  early  accretion 

stages, when the planetary body was not large enough to support the energy of the impacts over 

the degassing threshold (Atreya et al., 1989; Harper and Jacobsen, 1996; Jacobsen et al., 2008).  

On the other hand, one can expect that Earth’s deep mantle should also be depleted in 3He 

in  a similar way as the  other volatiles, because  of volatile  depletion  in  proto-Earth’s nebula 

source  reservoir,  metamorphic  degassing  in  planetesimals,  as  well  as  degassing  from  large 

planetesimals and planetary embryos during accretion (Harper and Jacobsen, 1996; Jacobsen et 

al., 2008; Lichtenberg et al., 2016; 2018; Benedikt et al., 2020; Lammer et al., 2020a, this issue). 

Short-lived radioactive isotopes such as 26Al, and 60Fe also determine the thermal history and 

interior structure of the early planetary building blocks additionally to impacts and gravitational 

energy (Lichtenberg et al., 2016; 2018). The following thermo-mechanical evolution results in 

internal differentiation, which is related to a rapid volatile outgassing that was recently studied 

in Benedikt et al. (2020) and also discussed in Lammer et al. (2020a, this issue). 

Therefore,  the  primordial  3He,  which  was  accreted  to  the  Earth  through  the  delivery  of 

carbonaceous  chondrites,  should  have  been  efficiently  lost,  similar  as  the  other  volatile 

elements, compared to its initial abundance in the primitive meteorite value. By comparing the 

3He  abundance  with  other  highly  volatile  elements  that  should  have  been  accreted  from  the 

same building blocks, Harper and Jacobsen (1996) argued that the inferred  3He abundance in 

the deep Earth is at least two orders of magnitude higher than that expected from accretion of 

dust and planetesimals, which was probably most likely ≤ 1% of its initial value (Harper and 

Jacobsen, 1996; Jacobsen et al., 2008). Because of this paradox, these authors concluded that 

the 3He in Earth’s deep mantle cannot be an accreted primitive component but is most likely a 

remnant  of  a  magma  ocean  equilibration-related  primitive  H2-He-dominated  primordial 

atmosphere. 

The preservation of such a primordial  helium  reservoir over the Earth’s  history  has been 

questioned on the basis of geophysical evidence of slab subduction into the lower mantle and 

mantle  convection  models  (e.g.,  van  der  Hilst  et  al.,  1997;  Maibom  et  al.,  2003;  Class  and 

26 

 
Goldstein,  2005;  Parman,  2007).  Recent  studies,  however,  confirmed  such  a  reservoir  of 

primordial helium from studies of the hottest mantle plumes (Jackson and Becker, 2017) and 

from  measured  He-Sr-Pb  isotope  ratios  in  superdeep  diamond  fluid  inclusions  from  the 

transition zone in a depth of 410 - 660 km which is unaffected by degassing and shallow crustal 

contamination  (Timmerman  et  al.,  2019).  These  authors  conclude  that  their  findings  are 

indications that a less degassed, high-3He/4He deep mantle source infiltrates this transition zone, 

where it interacts with recycled material, creating the diverse compositions recorded in ocean 

island basalts. This is, furthermore, an indication of a dense high-3He/4He deep-mantle domain 

that  could  have  remained  isolated  from  the  convecting  mantle  (e.g.,  Samuel  and  Farnetani, 

2003), which explains and supports the preservation of very early (> 4500 Ma) geochemical 

anomalies in lavas (e.g., Harper and Jacobsen, 1996; Jacobsen et al. 2008; Mukhopadhay, 2012; 

Jackson et al., 2016). 

Harper and Jacobsen (1996) suggested that the best explanation for the high abundance of 

3He isotopes in the deep mantle is that 0.8 MEarth accreted within the presence of a solar nebular-

composition atmosphere, which indicates a fast accretion of the early Earth. Such a scenario 

would be in agreement with the constrains obtained by the atmospheric Ar and Ne noble gas 

ratios (Lammer et al., 2020b), the Hf-W chronometer (Kleine and Walker, 2017, and references 

therein), and the Ca isotope systematics (Schiller et al., 2018), if proto Earth grew within the 

disk (≈ 3.3 – 4.5 Myr; Bollard et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017) to a mass of ≈ 0.53 - 0.58 MEarth, 

and to ≈ 0.8 MEarth immediately after disk dispersal, whilst the growing body was surrounded 

by the escaping H2-He-dominated primordial envelope (see Fig. 5). 

Besides  3He, there is  also an evidence of solar-like Ne isotopes in  the deep mantle (e.g., 

Mizuno  et  al.,  1980;  Honda  et  al.,  1991;  Porcelli  et  al.,  2001;  Yokochi  and  Marty,  2004; 

Jacobsen  et  al.,  2008;  Raquin  and  Moreira,  2009;  Jaupart  et  al.,  2017;  Péron  et  al.,  2018). 

Williams  and  Mukopadhayay  (2019)  measured  a  20Ne/22Ne  isotope  ratio  from  Earth’s  deep 

interior of 13.01 – 13.45, which is higher than a ratio of 12.52-12.75 that could also be produced 

through implantation of the solar wind onto accreted meteoritic material (Moreira and Kurz, 

2013; Moreira and Charnoz, 2016). This range is well in accordance with the 20Ne/22Ne isotope 

ratio of ≈13.34 of the solar nebula that was derived by Heber et al. (2012) from Genesis data. 

In agreement with the hypothesis of Harper and Jacobsen (1996) and Jacobsen et al. (2008), 

Williams and Mukhopadhayay (2019) suggest that some Ne isotopes that were embedded in a 

primordial atmosphere were incorporated with the solar ratio into proto-Earth’s interior via a 

magma ocean. Jacobsen et al. (2008) also argued that solar wind related implanted components 

would most likely be thoroughly outgassed and lost from early differentiated planetesimals due 

27 

 
to the before mentioned 26Al heating (Lichtenberg et al., 2016; 2018), which comports with the 

results of recent studies such as Young et al. (2019), Sossi et al. (2019), Benedikt et al. (2020) 

and Lammer et al. (2020a, this issue)  

Slower accretion scenarios with proto-Earth accreting < 0.53 MEarth during the disk lifetime 

of 3.3 – 4.5 Myr (Bollard et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017) would need planetary embryos that 

were extremely depleted in volatile and moderately volatile rock-forming elements (i.e. K, Na, 

Si, Mg, etc.) after the disk evaporated and  other explanations than a primordial atmospheric 

origin for the high 3He abundance in the deep mantle would have to be found. 

If proto-Earth, on the other hand, accreted too much mass during the disk lifetime (i.e., a 

mass of > 0.7 MEarth), an H2-dominated primordial atmosphere with a mass of ≥ 0.0042 MEarth 

would remain after disk dispersal, which could not be lost by EUV-driven hydrodynamic escape 

during a billion years, so that Earth would have most likely become a sub-Neptune-like body. 

3.2.5 Containing early Earth’s accretion from D/H 

If proto-Earth grew partly within the gas disk then one can argue that there should be  visible 

evidence  in  the  D/H  ratio  of  Earth’s  ocean  water  (e.g.  Meech  and  Raymond,  2019;  and 

references therein; Raymond and Morbidelli, 2020), since the D/H ratio of nebular gas of (21 ± 

5) × 10−6 is roughly 7 times lower (Geiss and Gloeckler, 1998; Robert et al., 1999) than Earth’s 

seawater D/H ratio of (150 ± 10) × 10−6 (e.g., Robert et al. 1999), which fits well within the 

measured D/H ratio in carbonaceous chondrites (e.g., Marty 2012). According to Ikoma and 

Genda (2006) and Ikoma et al. (2018), the atmospheric H2 within the primordial H2-dominated 

atmosphere can be oxidized by gas-rock interactions between the atmosphere and a magmatic 

surface with temperatures ≥ 1500 K, thereby producing H2O. The amount of nebular-related 

water depends both on the mass of the surrounding primordial atmosphere and on the available 

ion  oxides  and  fayalite  (Fe2SiO4)  in  the  magma ocean.  The  ratios  of  produced  water  to  the 

primordial atmospheric hydrogen MH2O/MH2 are ≈ 0.49, ≈ 24.02, and ≈ 0.88 for the quarz-iron-

fayalite-oxygen (2Fe + SiO2 + O2 ↔ Fe2SiO4), the wüstite-magnetite (6.696Fe0.974O + O2 ↔ 

2.174Fe3O4), and the ion-wüstite (1.894Fe + O2 ↔ 2Fe0.947O) buffers (Robie et al., 1978; Ikoma 

and Genda, 2006). Ikoma and Genda (2006) estimated that under such conditions a protoplanet 

that captured an H2-envelope from the disk gas with a mass of MH2 ≈ 1022 kg (0.00167 MEarth) 

would produce an H2O amount comparable to the mass of the Earth’s current ocean of MH2O ≈ 

1.4 × 1021g if such oxygen buffers were available. 

By applying the same assumption as Ikoma and Genda (2006) for an accretion scenario that 

can reproduce the present day atmospheric Ar and Ne isotope ratios based on the simulations 

of  Lammer  et  al.  (2020a),  a  proto-Earth  with  a  mass  of  0.55  MEarth  (see  also  Fig.  5)  with  a 

28 

 
captured primordial H-dominated atmosphere of roughly MH2 ≈ 3.5 × 10-5 MEarth (or 2.15 × 1020 

kg) produces a water reservoir of MH2O of ≈ 3.0 × 1019 g from the H2-envelope corresponding 

to only ≈ 2% of the current value of Earth’s seawater (see Fig. 6). Such a low value lies within 

the  error  bars  of  the  D/H  seawater-carbonaceous  chondrite  “match”  which  is  ≈  10  -  20% 

(Pahlevan et al., 2019; and references therein). 

Fig. 6: The amount of Earth oceans (green solid line) that are produced by the captured H2-
dominated primordial atmospheres (blue dashed line) as modelled in Lammer et al. (2020b) due 
to gas-rock interactions between the atmosphere and a magma ocean according to Ikoma and 
Genda (2006). The red “+” corresponds to the accretion scenario that can reproduce Earth’s 
atmospheric Ar and Ne isotope ratios, as shown in Fig. 5. In this scenario, a negligible amount 
of 2% of an Earth ocean with solar nebula origin would be produced. The blue area corresponds 
to  the  proto-Earth  masses  at  the  disk  dissipation  time  for  which  the  nebula-based  D/H-ratio 
would only modify the chondritic value of Earth’s seawater within its error bars. The dashed-
dotted lines mark the production of an Earth ocean from a primordial in case of proto-Earth 
accreting to 0.65 MEarth before the gas disk dissipated. 

If we estimate the hypothetical H2O production with similar assumptions as before but for a 

proto-Earth with a mass of 0.75 MEarth at the disk dispersal time of 4 Myr, an H2-envelope of 

0.0077  MEarth  (  4.59  ×  1022  kg)  would  be  captured  (Lammer  et  al.,  2020b).  In  such  a  case, 

roughly 4.5 times of Earth’s present seawater value, or some 4.5 Earth-oceans, could have been 

produced due to the nebula gas-magma ocean interaction processes. One can see from Fig. 6, 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that proto-Earth masses > 0.6 MEarth should have left behind D/H ratios that would differ largely 

from the measured carbonaceous chondritic value. 

Another indication that at least a small fraction of Earth’s H2O may be derived from a nebular 

origin comes from measurements of the D/H ratios in glassy melt inclusions in two basaltic 

rock samples that originated in a deep mantle reservoir by Hallis et al. (2015). These authors 

found  D/H  ratios  in  their  samples  that  are  closer  to  the  nebular  than  to  the  carbonaceous 

chondritic ratio. 

According  to  the  reproduction  attempts  of  Venus’  atmospheric  Ar,  Ne  and  bulk  K/U  ratios 

(Lammer et al., 2020a, this issue; 2020b), more nebula-based water could have been produced 

compared to early Earth’s expected evolution  as shown in the blue area of Fig. 6 due to proto-

Venus possibly being slightly more massive. This would indicate that Venus’ initial D/H ratio 

was  probably  closer  to  the  nebula  ratio  than  to  carbonaceous  chondrites.  Since  the  planet’s 

initial water inventory and its D/H ratio was modified during the planets evolution by thermal 

escape and various nonthermal atmospheric loss processes as well as water vapor outgassing 

episodes (see Lammer et al., 2020a, this issue) it is difficult to draw definite conclusions. New 

future in-situ measurements of Venus atmospheric D/H ratio in combination with heavier noble 

gas isotopes as discussed in Dandouras et al. (2020; this issue) are essential for constraining 

and understanding the evolution of early Venus’ water inventory and atmosphere. 

One should also note that the production of nebula-based water depend on the nebula properties 

such as the dust grain depletion factor, etc. (Lammer et al., 2014; Kimura and Ikoma, 2020), 

which can be different on other star systems. Recently, Kimura and Ikoma (2020) showed that 

primordial atmospheres could be highly enriched in water vapor, if one does not assume solar 

abundances for the gas disk properties. 

3.6 Protoplanetary masses of Venus, Earth and Mars at disk dispersal time constrained 

from different isotope reproduction studies 

If we summarize the different discussed isotope-systematics that are related to D/H, primordial 

3He,  36Ar/38Ar,  20Ne/22Ne,  36Ar/22Ne,  48Ca/44Ca  abundances  and  ratios,  and  chronometric 

methods based on  182Hf-182W and U-P isotopes one obtains the accretion scenarios for early 

Earth illustrated in Fig. 7. 

The min. and max. disk lifetime according to Bollard et al. (2017) and Wang et al. (2017) is 

represented by the two vertical dashed-lines. The lower horizontal dashed-line corresponds to 

the minimum proto-Earth-mass, which is necessary for a protoplanet at 1 AU to build-up and 

keep an H2-He-dominated primordial atmosphere (Lammer et al., 2020b) from the solar nebula 

30 

 
 
for some while. The blueish shaded area above the mass fraction of proto-Earth corresponds to 

masses  for  which  primordial  atmospheres  remain  too  long  around  the  growing  planetary 

nucleus for a distance of 1 AU (Sasaki and Nakazawa, 1990; Lammer et al. 2020a, this issue; 

2020b). As discussed in Sec. 3.2.4, there is an excess of 3He in the deep mantle, which is two 

orders of magnitude higher than the 3He amount that was delivered by planetesimals and dust. 

Because it is expected that this 3He excess originated most likely due to ingassing (equilibration 

with a global magma ocean) from a primordial H2-He-dominated atmosphere (e.g., Harper and 

Jacobsen, 1996; Jacobsen et al., 2008; Jackson et al., 2017; Timmerman et al., 2019), one can 

use this primordial  3He evidence for constraining the minimum proto-Earth-mass at the disk 

dispersal time, in agreement with the reproduced atmospheric 36Ar/38Ar, 20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/22Ne, 

noble gas ratios (see Sect; 3.2.3, Lammer et al., 2020a; 2020b, this issue) of  0.53 MEarth. 

The upper mass of proto-Earth at the disk dispersal time can be constrained with the D/H 

ratio  of  Earth’s  seawater  in  agreement  with  the  reproduction  of  the  atmospheric  Ar  and  Ne 

isotope ratios (see Sect. 3.2.3; Lammer et al., 2020a; this issue; 2020b) of 0.5 < M ≤ 0.6 MEarth. 

As discussed in Sect. 3.2.5, higher proto-Earth-masses would have resulted in too massive 

H2-He-dominated primordial envelopes that would have produced a too high amount of ocean 

water  through  the  reaction  between  the  primordial  atmospheric  hydrogen  and  oxides  in  the 

magma  ocean  (Ikoma  and  Genda,  2006).  Such  a  mixture  of  water  from  nebular  and 

carbonaceous chondritic origin would have resulted in different D/H ratios than measured in 

Earth’s seawater, which is close to the D/H value measured in carbonaceous chondrites (e.g., 

Marty 2012). The dark grey box that is confined between proto-Earth masses of ≈ 0.53 - 0.6 

MEarth, and the min and max disk dispersal time of 3.3 and 4.5 Myr, therefore, corresponds to 

the  range  to  which  the  accreting  proto-Earth  should  have  evolved  to  produce  the  preserved 

isotope records. The dotted-vertical line marks the time when the primordial atmosphere was 

lost (Lammer et al., 2020a). 

In case proto-Earth accreted very fast (dotted brownish line), almost to its whole mass within 

6 - 7 Myr. Schiller et al. (2018) inferred it from Ca-isotope systematics (see Sect. 3.2.2), then 

the disk lifetime should have been close to its minimum value. At this time, the luminosity of 

the young Sun was yet higher so that a slightly denser primordial atmosphere could have been 

lost from a more massive proto-Earth of 0.6 MEarth at the time of disk dispersal. A continuous 

fast growth until about 7 Myr after the origin of the Solar System combined with the escaping 

primordial  atmosphere  can  reproduce  the  present  atmospheric  Ar  and  Ne  isotope  ratios 

including 36Ar/22Ne (see Lammer et al., 2020a for details). 

31 

 
The solid and dashed brownish lines correspond to the dual or two stage accretion scenarios 

as proposed by Yu and Jacobsen (2011) and Dauphas (2003). Both scenarios can also produce 

the studied isotope record. Most of the recent studies that used the Hf-W-chronometry method 

for dating the core formation expect a complete equilibrium or nearly complete equilibrium of 

metal and silicates favouring Hf/W values betweeb 10 – 20, thereby indicating a fast accretion 

of ≥ 0.8 MEarth before ≤ 30 Myr (Rudge et al. 2010; Kleine et al., 2002; Yin and Jacobsen, 2006; 

Yu and Jacobsen, 2011; Kleine and Walker, 2017; and references therein). There are difficulties 

to homogenise isotopic data related to the composition of Earth’s accreted material between the 

measurements  of  lithophile,  and  moderate  and  highly  siderophile  elements  (Dauphas,  2017) 

and µ48Ca (Schiller et al., 2018). 

Fig. 7: Illustration of the most likely proto-Earth accretion scenarios as constrained by different 
isotope-systematics (D-H, atmospheric Ar & Ne, primordial 3He abundance in the deep mantle) 
and isotopic chronometers (Hf-W, U-P) in dependence on the disk lifetime and activity of the 
young Sun. Proto-Earth’s mass fraction during disk dispersal should have been ≈ 0.5 – 0.6 MEarth 
(dark grey area).  

From this discussion, one can see that the initial setup of planets that may later evolve to an 

Earth-like habitat is a complex interplay between the lifetime of the gas-disk, the accretion rate 

32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the terrestrial planet and the EUV evolution path of its young host star. If the Solar System 

disk lifetime had been about 8 Myr instead of ≈ 4 Myr (Bollard et al., 2017; Wang et al. 2017), 

Earth would have accreted too much primordial atmospheric mass within the protoplanetary 

nebula  and  would  have  ended  as  a  small  sub-Neptune  or  an  ocean  planet  surrounded  by  a 

remnant of its primordial atmosphere that could not escape during its lifetime. 

Due to insufficient noble gas isotope data, at present one cannot conclude much about the 

main  composition  of  proto-Venus.  If,  however,  proto-Venus  accumulated  a  primordial 

atmosphere, it should have finished its accretion slightly faster than proto-Earth and did not 

grow further due to a lack of planetary embryos/accreting material at 0.7 AU, while early Earth 

at 1 AU could have still accreted ≤ 0.4 MEarth after the disk dispersal (Lammer et al., 2020a; 

2020b, this issue).  

In the case of early Mars, according to Hf-W chronometry (Dauphas and Pourmand, 2011; 

Kleine and Walker, 2017), this small planet also accreted most of its mass (> 0.63 – 1.0 MMars) 

during the disk phase, but proto-Mars was too small to capture a tiny primordial atmosphere 

that remained around its rocky nucleus after the dissipation of the disk (Lammer et al., 2018). 

Out of the formation hypotheses and model results that are compared in Table 1 of Section 

2,  currently  the  most  likely  ones  to  have  formed  terrestrial  planets  are  pebble  accretion 

(Johansen and Lambrechts,  2017) and some Grand Tack models (Brasser  et  al.,  2016);  they 

come the closest to the accretion of planetary embryos with masses of ≈ 0.5MEarth after a few 

Myr.  Planetesimals  grow  into  large  planetary  embryos,  even  giant  cores,  or  gas  giants  by 

accreting planetesimals  or pebbles, or most likely a combination of both (Lambrechts et  al., 

2019). One should note that model simulations of planetesimal accretion struggle to grow giant 

massive planetary cores within the disk lifetime of 3-5 Myr (e.g., Levison et al., 2015a; 2015b). 

Such  fast  accretion  scenarios  may  be  solved  by  pebble  accretion,  but  key  aspects  of  pebble 

accretion  remain  to  be  better  understood  (Lambrechts  and  Johansen,  2012;  Johansen  et  al., 

2015; 2017; Birnstiel et al., 2016; Bitsch et al., 2019). 

According  to  studies  of  Johansen  et  al.  (2015),  recent  simulations  indicate  that  the  main 

growth  of  planetesimals  results  from  the  gas  drag-assisted  accretion  of  chondrules.  Thus, 

chondrules represent the building blocks of planetesimals, planetary embryos, protoplanets and 

finally, terrestrial planets (e.g., Lambrechts and Johansen, 2012; Johansen et al., 2015; Birnstiel 

et  al.,  2016;  Johansen  and  Lambrechts,  2017;  Alexander,  2019a;  2019b).  It  is  expected  that 

these scenarios evolve from a two-stage process, where the first generation of accreting bodies 

form very fast by streaming instabilities followed by continuous growth that is dominated by 

the gas-drag in  combination with the accretion of mm-sized particles for planetesimals  with 

33 

 
radii larger than about 200 km (Johansen et al., 2015). The streaming instability most likely 

represents a promising mechanism that can explain how dust particles grow to 100 km large 

planetesimals. The streaming instability, however, requires specific conditions to operate and 

this implies that planetesimals may form in preferential locations, just beyond the snow line 

(Izidoro and Raymond, 2017). However, at present knowledge, pebble accretion and streaming 

instabilities most likely solve the first stages in planet accretion (Fig. 1: I and II), as it results in 

the fast formation of Mars-sized embryos and even more massive protoplanets ≥ 0.5 MEarth over 

typical disk lifetimes of 3 - 5 Myr. The later stage of accretion (Fig. 1: III, IV) of the terrestrial 

planet structure of the inner Solar System can then be quite well explained by the Grand-Tack 

model and to some extent by the annulus and depleted disk models as well. A clear future step 

in terrestrial planet formation will be an N-body simulation that also includes the reproduction 

of isotopic and geochemical constraints. 

4 Conclusions 

We reviewed the classical scenarios of terrestrial planet formation, including the Grand-Tack 

model and more recently proposed alternatives. The terrestrial planet formation models were 

compared with accretion time scales obtained from isotope data of planetary building blocks, 

the atmospheric Ar and Ne isotope data of Earth and Venus, Earth’s D/H isotope ratio in the 

sea  water  and  the  evidence  of  3H  abundance  in  the  deep  mantle,  as  well  as  182Hf-182W 

chronometry. The analysis of these data indicate that the early terrestrial planets in the Solar 

System  could  have  accreted  most  of  their  mass  (≥  0.8  MEarth)  within  the  first  10-30  Myr, 

including a Moon-forming event related to Earth ≥ 50 Myr after the Solar System originated. 

From the combined evidence of the atmospheric 36Ar/38Ar, 20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/22Ne isotope ratios, 

the D/H ratio in Earth’s seawater and the estimated 3He abundance that likely originated due to 

ingassing from a primordial atmosphere, one finds that proto-Earth accreted a mass of 0.5 – 0.6 

MEarth at ≈ 4 Myr, the time when the disk dissipated. The planetesimals  grow into planetary 

embryos  and  or  protoplanets  by  accreting  pebbles,  planetesimals,  or  a  combination  of  both. 

Pebble accretion most likely solves time scale conflicts of fast accretion, although some aspects 

of pebble accretion remain to be better understood. For instance, more observations of the radial 

dependence of pebble sizes in disks, coagulation models that include volatiles, and experiments 

on the sticking properties of aggregates of a range of compositions are necessary. The late stage 

accretion of terrestrial planets can than explain the structure of the inner Solar System. Here, 

the Grand Tack model, the primordial low-mass asteroid belt, and the primordial empty asteroid 

belt  models  yield  quite  accurate  results.  More  studies  are  needed  to  homogenise  pebble 

accretion  and  later  stage  accretion  models  with  data  that  are  provided  by  chemical, 
34 

 
chronological, isotopical and dynamical constraints. Furthermore, precise measurements of the 

isotopic composition of Venus are necessary for testing the planet’s evolution, including the 

isotopic composition of its building blocks.
