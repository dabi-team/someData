Abstract We present here an interesting two–step ﬁlament eruption during
14–15 March 2015. The ﬁlament was located in NOAA AR 12297 and asso-
ciated with a halo Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). We use observations from
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Heliospheric Magnetic Imager
(HMI) instruments onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and from
the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Large Angle and Spectromet-
ric Coronagraph (LASCO). We also use Hα data from the Global Oscillation
Network Group (GONG) telescope and the Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory. The
ﬁlament shows a ﬁrst step eruption on 14 March 2015 and it stops its rise at
a projected altitude ≈ 125 Mm on the solar disk. It remains at this height
for ≈ 12 hrs. Finally it eruptes on 15 March 2015 and produced a halo CME.
We also ﬁnd jet activity in the active region during both days, which could
help the ﬁlament de-stabilization and eruption. The decay index is calculated to
understand this two–step eruption. The eruption could be due to the presence
of successive instability–stability–instability zones as the ﬁlament is rising.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬁlaments (known as prominences, when they appear on the limb) are dense
and cool material suspended in the hot solar corona along polarity inversion lines

(PILs). They are found in magnetic dip regions. The ﬁlaments can be located in
quiet as well as in solar active regions. The existence, stability and disappearance
of ﬁlaments are nicely described in recent reviews (Mackay et al., 2010; Labrosse
et al., 2010; Parenti, 2014). There are two main magnetic conﬁgurations for
the ﬁlaments, namely a sheared arcade and a ﬂux rope. In the sheared arcade
conﬁguration, the arcade connects the opposite polarities on either sides of a PIL,
whereas in the case of the ﬂux rope conﬁguration the magnetic ﬁeld has helical
magnetic structure. Solar ﬁlament eruptions are also responsible for Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs) and hence for geomagnetic activity. Therefore the study
of their stability and eruption is very important for space weather prediction.

Active region ﬁlaments (for example Chandra et al., 2010) are usually asso-
ciated more with solar ﬂares in comparison to quiet region ﬁlaments (Gosain
et al., 2016). It is not necessary that every ﬁlament activation results in a CME.
The result of the activation of ﬁlaments can be a failed eruption (Ji et al.,
2003; T¨or¨ok and Kliem, 2005; Alexander, Liu, and Gilbert, 2006; Kuridze et al.,
2013; Kushwaha et al., 2015), a partial eruption (Gibson and Fan, 2006; Liu
et al., 2014; Kliem et al., 2014) or a full eruption (Chandra et al., 2016). When
a ﬁlament erupts partially or fully and moves away from the solar surface it
becomes a CME. Therefore there is a spectrum from fully conﬁned to fully
eruptive ﬁlament activations. In the latest studies the Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory (STEREO) has provided two view-points of ﬁlament eruptions.
Combining the STEREO data with SDO data, three view-point studies have
been done (Filippov, 2013, 2016b).

A ﬂux rope is in equilibrium due to the balance between the upward magnetic
hoop–force and the downwards magnetic tension of the overlying coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld. If due to some process like reconnection between new and existing
magnetic ﬂux the stability of the ﬂux rope is lost, it starts to erupt. Several
models have been proposed for solar eruptions (for reviews see Aulanier, 2014;
Filippov et al., 2015; Schmieder, Aulanier, and Vrˇsnak, 2015; Vrˇsnak et al.,
2014). Catastrophic loss of equilibrium or the torus instability are the important
mechanisms for solar eruptions (Forbes and Isenberg, 1991; Kliem and T¨or¨ok,
2006; D´emoulin and Aulanier, 2010). In these models, it is assumed that the
overlying magnetic ﬁeld (Bexternal) decreases with the increase of the height (h)
from the photosphere i.e. Bexternal ∝ h−n. The ﬂux rope becomes unstable when
the decay index n at its location becomes less than a critical value. According to
simulations this value ranges from 1.3 to 1.75 (T¨or¨ok and Kliem, 2005; Isenberg
and Forbes, 2007; Aulanier et al., 2010; Zuccarello et al., 2017). Using diﬀerent
observations including high resolution SDO and multi–view STEREO observa-
tions it was found that this value lies between 1 and 1.5 in observed eruptions
(Filippov and Den, 2001; Filippov, 2013; Zuccarello et al., 2014; McCauley et al.,
2015).

In addition to failed, partial and full ﬁlament eruptions, recently two ﬁlament
eruptions were observed with a quasi-equilibrium state in the middle part of
a two-step process (Byrne et al., 2014; Gosain et al., 2016). In these cases the
ﬁlament starts to erupt and after attaining some height it decelerates, stops and
seems to be stable for some time. In case of Byrne et al. (2014) this time was
rather short i.e. ≈ one hour and for the case of Gosain et al. (2016) the time was

15 hrs. Such cases are very crucial and play an important role in understanding
the space weather implications of ﬁlament eruptions. In this study, we analyze
an active-region-ﬁlament eruption on 14–15 March 2015, where we notice that
after the initial eruption the ﬁlament stays for ≈ 12 hrs in the quasi-equilibrium
state.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the observational data,
and the morphology of the ﬁlament eruption. The time–distance analysis of the
ﬁlament eruption is presented in Section 3. The associated CME is described
in Section 4. To interpret the quasi–equilibrium of the ﬁlament, we present the
decay index calculation in Section 5. Finally in Section 6, we discuss our results
and conclude.

2. Observations

The active region, NOAA AR 12297 produced one of the largest geomagnetic
storm (Dst index ≈ −223 nT) of Solar Cycle 24 on 17 March 2015. This ge-
omagnetic storm was associated with a ﬁlament eruption and a Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) C9.1 class ﬂare of 2015 March 15.
The active region NOAA AR 12297 was located at S22W25 on 15 March 2015 on
the solar disk. Further this ﬁlament eruption was associated with a halo CME.
The ﬁlament eruption on 2015 March 15 was studied by Wang et al. (2016),
whileas the geomagnetic storm from this active region was investigated by Liu
et al. (2015). The eruption also produced a magnetic cloud (MC) studied by
Cho et al. (2017). They calculated the helicity sign in the MC and found it
was associated with a positive helicity. Our aim in this study is to investigate
the ﬁlament activation and eruption of 14–15 March 2015. This ﬁlament was
disturbed on 14 March 2015 and ﬁnally on 15 March 2015, it totally erupted.
The event was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen
et al., 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell, Thomp-
son, and Chamberlin, 2012) in diﬀerent UV and EUV wavelengths. The pixel
size and cadence of the data is 0.6 arcsec and 12 s respectively. The event was
also observed by the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) in the Hα line
center. The temporal and pixel resolution of GONG Hα data are one min and
one arcsec respectively. For the magnetic ﬁeld, we use the data from Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al., 2012) onboard SDO. The cadence
of the HMI data is 45 s and the pixel resolution is 0.5 arcsec.

The observational description of the ﬁlament activation and eruption on 14–
15 March 2015 observed by diﬀerent instruments is presented in the following
sections.

2.1. SDO and Hα Observations

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the ﬁlament on 14 March 2015 in AIA 193 ˚A
(ﬁrst column), 304 ˚A (second column), and GONG Hα (third column). Figure
1a is overplotted with HMI magnetic ﬁeld contours. Before any activity in the
ﬁlament it has a long sigmoidal shape (see Figure 1a, e, f, and also the yellow

arrow). We can see the sinistral barbs in GONG Hα images. According to Martin
(1998), if the barbs in the ﬁlament are directed leftwards (rightwards) their
chiralities are sinistral (dextral) respectively. The sinistral (dextral) chiralities
indicate positive (negative) twist/helicity respectively. In our case the sinistral
barbs are represented by blue arrow in Figure 1i. This suggests the ﬁlament has
a positive twist and hence positive helicity. Since the ﬁlament is located in the
southern hemisphere, this is in conformity with the hemispheric rule of helicity.
According to the helicity hemispheric rule the majority of positive/negative
helicity solar features located in the southern/northern hemisphere respectively
(Pevtsov, Canﬁeld, and Metcalf, 1995).

Around 11:50 UT a jet activity started in the active region, which we name
as jet 1 and mark by the white arrow in Figure 1b. This jet activity was visible
in almost all EUV/UV and Hα wavelengths. Due to this jet activity the left
lower part of the sigmoidal ﬁlament was disturbed. Afterwards a strand of the
ﬁlament separated from the main body, rose upwards and became stable at
the projected altitude ≈ 125 Mm. The broken part of the sigmoidal ﬁlament is
labeled by F1 and indicated by the red arrow in Figure 1c, d. At the same time,
we observe ﬂare brightening in the active region which was reported by GOES as
a C2.6 class ﬂare. The upper–right part of the ﬁlament channel, which was not
disturbed in this period is shown by black arrows in Figure 1k. LASCO C2 at
≈ 13:30 UT on March 14 also observed a partial halo CME. Later on this CME
interacted with the CME of March 15 (Liu et al., 2015). The CME on March
14 was associated with the small ﬁlament in the active region, which is diﬀerent
than the ﬁlament studied here. A small ﬁlament eruption was associated with
this CME as reported by Wang et al. (2016) and is named F4 in their Figure 1a.
An interesting point is that the uplifted broken part F1 from the main sig-
moidal ﬁlament was stable in that particular location for a period of ≈ 12 hrs
i.e up to 00:45 UT on 15 March 2015. Around 00:45 UT on 15 March 2015, we
again observe the jet/surge activity in the active region towards the west-south
direction which interacts with the ﬁlament F1 as well as with the big northern
ﬁlament (indicated by three black arrows). We label this jet as jet 2. After 00:45
UT the ﬁlament F1 starts to erupt and ﬁnally it leaves the solar surface. The
evolution of the erupting ﬁlament is shown in Figure 2. The left, middle and right
column of Figure 2 show the development of the erupting ﬁlament F1 in AIA
193 ˚A, 304 ˚A, and Hα wavelengths respectively. The eruption is associated with
a GOES 9.1 class ﬂare. The ﬂare has a two–ribbon structure visible in diﬀerent
EUV and Hα images. We can also see the ribbon separation as proposed by
the CSHKP model (Carmichael, 1964; Sturrock, 1966; Hirayama, 1974; Kopp
and Pneuman, 1976). The ﬂare was also observed in hard X-rays by the Reuven
Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) satellite and studied
by Wang et al. (2016).

The major upper part of the sigmoidal ﬁlament channel (indicated by black
arrows in Figure 2) is also perturbed during the ejection of jet 2. The material
of the ﬁlament rises up and later on it comes back down to the footpoints of the
ﬁlaments. In AIA channels it becomes brighter and we can also see its twisted
structure. From Figure 2d (see also movie in AIA 193 ˚A), one can infer that the
twist is right–handed, which is consistent with the sinistral ﬁlament chirality seen

Two Step Filament Eruption During 14–15 March 2015

in Hα data. Therefore, we see here the same sign of twist in the chromosphere,
the upper solar atmosphere and in the associated magnetic cloud. It seems that
jet 2 injects impulse and heat into the ﬁlament at its eastern end. Just after
the maximum brightness of the mini-ﬂare in the active region at 00:39 UT,
dark and bright features appear in AIA 193 ˚A images, which move from the
ﬂare place along the ﬁlament channel (see movie in AIA 193 ˚A). Obviously the
ﬂare happens near the eastern end of the ﬁlament and jet 2 propagates along
ﬁeld lines belonging to the ﬂux rope containing the ﬁlament. Accelerated and
heated plasma of the jet inﬂuence signiﬁcantly the equilibrium of the whole
ﬁlament. Previously static ﬁlament material starts to move along the helical
ﬁeld-lines of the ﬂux rope. Thus the upper parts of the helices become visible
as dark and bright (due to heating) threads. We observe intense ﬁeld-aligned
motions within the activated ﬂux rope but it does not change signiﬁcantly its
position, and after the energetic phase of the event the ﬁlament is restored to its
approximate initial state. We consider arguments for such behavior in Section
5. During the activation the ﬁlament becomes less visible in the Hα wavelength
(see the Hα images in the third column of Figure 2) most likely for two reasons.
The Doppler shift in the moving material can move its Hα line out of the ﬁlter
passband (dynamic disappearance), and the heating of the ﬁlament can suppress
the absorption of Hα radiation (thermal disappearance).

3. Time–Distance Analysis

To investigate the height–time evolution of the ﬁlament eruption during 14–15
March 2015, we select a slit along the direction of the ﬁlament eruption in the
AIA 193 ˚A data. The position of the slit is shown by the dashed black line in
Figure 3a. The time-distance diagram is given in Figure 3b. In the time-distance
diagram, we can clearly see the two step eruption of the ﬁlament. In the ﬁrst
step, the ﬁlament starts to rise at ≈ 12:00 UT on 14 March 2015 and shifts
to a projected altitude of 125 Mm on the disk. Unfortunately we do not have
STEREO observations, which could tell us the true height of the eruption. We
compute the speed of this eruption and ﬁnd it to be ≈ 40 km s−1. After 13:00
UT the ﬁlament stops its rise and stays at the same height up to 00:45 UT on 15
March 2015. In the second step after 00:45 UT on 15 March 2015, the ﬁlament
starts to rise and ﬁnally fully erupts. The calculated speed of the second step
eruption is 70 km s−1.

4. LASCO Observations

The CME associated with the ﬁlament eruption on 15 March 2015 was observed
with the LASCO instrument (Brueckner et al., 1995). As reported in Wang et al.
(2016), during the C2.6 class ﬂare of 14 March 2015 a small ﬁlament erupted (see
their Figure 1a, F4 ﬁlament) and there was a slow CME observed in the LASCO
C2 ﬁeld–of–view (FOV) at ≈ 13:30 UT. The speed and the angular width of this
CME was 208 km s−1 and 160◦ respectively.

SOLA: Chandra_twostep_filament_eruption_rev2.tex; 20 June 2021; 12:22; p. 5

R. Chandra et al.

The F1 ﬁlament eruption on 15 March 2015 produced a halo CME, visible in
the LASCO C2 FOV at 01:48 UT. The CME was visible up to 27 R(cid:12) in the
LASCO C3 FOV. The running diﬀerence of the C2 and C3 coronagraph images
are shown in Figure 4. The white circle represents the solar disk occulted by
the coronagraph. In the C2 images, the running diﬀerence of SDO/AIA 193 ˚A
images are displayed inside the white circles for the same time. The red and
yellow arrows indicate the leading edge of the CME in the LASCO C2 and C3
FOV respectively. The black arrow in the ﬁrst image of the bottom panel points
to the CME from the same active region on 14 March 2015. According to the
LASCO Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) Catalog (Gopalswamy
et al., 2009) the average CME speed was 719 km s−1 and the acceleration was
−9.0 m s−2. The mass and kinetic energy of the CME were 3.0×1016 gram and
7.7 ×1031 ergs respectively. Moreover, Liu et al. (2015) reported the maximum
CME speed was 1100 kms−1. In the C3 FOV the CMEs of 14 and 15 March
2015 interacted at 02:18 UT. Liu et al. (2015) considered the interaction of
these CMEs as the cause of the strong geomagnetic storm of Solar Cycle 24 on
17 March 2015.

5. Decay Index Calculations

In order to ﬁnd the reasons why the part F1 of the initial ﬁlament erupted after a
12 hr delay in an intermediate state, while the remainder of the ﬁlament did not
leave its position despite the strong activation, we should analyze the structure
of the magnetic ﬁeld surrounding these parts of the ﬁlament. Since the stability
of the ﬂux-rope equilibrium depends on the value of the decay index, we need
to know the distribution of this parameter in the active region. In principle, the
decay index should be calculated for the coronal ﬁeld external to the ﬂux rope.
We can consider the electric current of the ﬂux rope as the major coronal current
within the volume of interest, while the surrounding magnetic ﬁeld is created by
currents located below the photosphere. For this part of the coronal ﬁeld, which
is needed for decay index calculations, we can use a potential-ﬁeld extrapolation
of the photospheric ﬁeld data.

We are interesting in the distribution of the potential magnetic ﬁeld in the
volume around the ﬁlament, which is much less than the size of the solar sphere.
The bottom boundary of this domain is a part of the photosphere only slightly
deviating from the shape of a ﬂat surface. We cut a rectangular area of the pho-
tospheric magnetogram below the ﬁlament and use it as the boundary condition
for the solution of the boundary-value problem in terms of Green’s functions
(Filippov and Den, 2001; Filippov, 2013). Doing this we ignore the inﬂuence
of sources that are located outside the chosen area. In many cases it can be
reasonable.

In our case the active region NOAA AR 12297 is the strongest magnetic source
on the disk and is rather distant from other active regions. On March 14 and
especially on March 15 the active region is at a considerable distance from the
central meridian, so we need to take into account the projection eﬀect.

Figure 5a represents the modiﬁed fragment of the magnetogram taken by the
HMI on 14 March 2015 at 15:00 UT, which is used as a boundary condition for
the potential magnetic ﬁeld calculations. The pixel size in HMI magnetograms
is 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) or 0.36 Mm, which is very small compared with the expected height of a
ﬁlament > 10 Mm. To save computational time we apply binning several times
and increase the pixel size to ≈ 10 Mm. Figure 5b–f shows the distribution of
the decay index

n = −

∂ ln Bt
∂ ln h

(1)

where Bt is the horizontal magnetic-ﬁeld component and h is the height above
the photosphere, at diﬀerent heights above the area shown in the panel (a).
The thin lines show isocontours of n = 0.5, 1, 1.5, while the thick red lines
indicate the positions of PILs at respective heights. Areas where n > 1 are
tinted with grey, while regions with n < 1 are white. Green contours show the
position of the ﬁlament taken from the co-aligned Kanzelhoehe Hα ﬁltergram
transformed in the same way as the magnetogram (Figure 6). Note that all panels
(b)–(f) represent the 2D plots viewed from the normal-to-the-surface direction.
Since the ﬁlaments are located at some unknown heights (we will consider this
problem below) above this surface and the surface is inclined to the line-of-
sight, the position of the ﬁlament contours does not correspond exactly to the
position of magnetic features at any height (the ﬁlaments should be somewhat
shifted to the north-west in this projection). However, the ﬁlament contours
show approximately the places of our interest.

A PIL is a favorable place for horizontal equilibrium of a ﬂux rope, because
the vertical component of the coronal ﬁeld vanishes. Any PIL at any height
can be considered as a potential location of the ﬂux rope, but it is only a
necessary condition. Another necessary (but again not suﬃcient) condition for
stable equilibrium is that the decay index is below the critical value. In fact,
ﬂux ropes may be found only in few places where both conditions are fulﬁlled.
In Figure 5, the segments of PILs within white areas (or at least outside of
isocontours 1.5) are the places favorable for the occurrence of a stable ﬂux rope.
Below 60 Mm (Figure 5c) the segments of the PIL near both green contours
are suitable for stable ﬂux ropes. The contour n = 1 touches the PIL near both
ﬁlaments at the height of 75 Mm (Figure 5d), while the contour n = 1.5 touches
the PIL near the southern ﬁlament at the height of 100 Mm (Figure 5e) and
near the western ﬁlament at the height of 120 Mm (Figure 5f).

Unfortunately, we cannot measure directly the height of the ﬁlaments because
STEREO is in an unfavorable position. However, we can estimate the heights
using the method proposed by Filippov (2016b). It is based on the (conﬁrmed
by observations) assumption that the material of ﬁlaments is accumulated near
coronal magnetic neutral surfaces Br = 0 (Filippov, 2016a). It was found also
that the potential approximation for coronal magnetic ﬁelds is suﬃcient for the
ﬁlament height estimations. Comparison of the 3D shape of the neutral surface,
represented in the projection on the plane of the sky as a set of PILs, with the
ﬁlament shape and position allows us to obtain information about the heights

SOLA: Chandra_twostep_filament_eruption_rev2.tex; 20 June 2021; 12:22; p. 7

R. Chandra et al.

of diﬀerent parts of the ﬁlament including its top, or spine, which is the most
reliable indicator of the ﬂux-rope axis.

Figure 6 shows the fragment of the Kanzelhoehe Hα ﬁltergram of the same
region as in Figure 5 co-aligned with the magnetogram and transformed in the
same way. The same PILs as in Figure 5b–f are shown but every PIL is shifted
in x and y coordinates by values

and

∆x = htgλ0

∆y = htgϕ0,

(2)

(3)

where h is the height of the PIL, λ0 and ϕ0 are the longitude and latitude of
the selected area center. Thus they are projected on the plane of the sky in the
same way as the ﬁlament in the on-disk ﬁltergram. The lowest PIL at the height
of 6 Mm is red, while the other is blue. The spine of the western ﬁlament follows
exactly the PIL at the height of 30 Mm. All of the ﬁlament body is located
between this line and the red line at the height of 6 Mm. The southern ﬁlament
does not so strictly follow any PIL, however, its spine is most likely a little
bit above the PIL at the height of 78 Mm. For comparison Figure 7 shows the
ﬁlament and the neutral surface on 14 March at 11 UT before the separation into
two parts. The spine of the western section of the ﬁlament also follows exactly
the PIL at the height of 30 Mm, while the eastern section seems to be higher.
The top of the wide part of the eastern section touches the PIL at the height of
54 Mm and the thin thread-like continuation of the spine crosses all PILs.

Returning to Figure 5 we establish that the western section of the ﬁlament
before the separation and the western ﬁlament after the separation are relatively
low (30 Mm) and are located in the zone of stability within the coronal magnetic
ﬁeld. The eastern section of the ﬁlament is less stable because on the one hand it
is higher and on the other hand the decay index in this area is also higher. That is
why, possibly, the disturbance coming from inner parts of the active region leads
to the partial and failed eruption of the eastern section of the ﬁlament, which
results in the separation of the ﬁlament into two parts. The erupted eastern
section of the ﬁlament obviously ﬁnds a new equilibrium position at a greater
height. In the new position of the eastern section, this height (about 80 Mm),
now considered as the southern ﬁlament F1, is within the zone of stability for the
decay index threshold n c = 1.5 and on the edge of stability for the decay index
threshold n c = 1. The next disturbance from the active region easily causes the
start of the eruption of the southern ﬁlament and this eruption is full because
there is no a zone of stability at heights above 100 Mm. So, the eastern section
of the ﬁlament shows a two–step eruption with a metastable state at a height of
80 Mm for 12 hrs. Possibly it could stay there longer if the strong disturbance
did not come from inner parts of the active region. The western ﬁlament is deep
within the zone of stability and therefore it did not erupt despite the strong
activation by the energetic disturbance.

6. Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented the two–step ﬁlament eruption of 14–15 March
2015 using observations from AIA onboard the SDO satellite and ground–based
GONG and Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory Hα data. Our main results are as
follows:

• The initiation of the ﬁlament eruption on 14 March 2015 and its full erup-
tion on 15 March 2015 are associated with the jets in the active region.

• The decay index calculation suggests that on 14 March 2015 the ﬁlament
ﬁrst enters into the instability zone and after reaching some height it ﬁnds
itself in the stability zone. Again on 15 March 2015 the ﬁlament enters into
the instability zone and ﬁnally it erupts.

• The major part of ﬁlament which had not been destroyed on 14 March 2015
was activated on March 15 but could not erupt. Therefore it was a failed
eruption. The coronal magnetic ﬁeld calculation evidences that the decay
index at the ﬁlament location is below the threshold of the torus instability
and hence the ﬁlament fails to erupt.

• The observation of the same sign of the twist/helicity in the chromosphere,
higher solar atmosphere and in the magnetic cloud evidence the conserva-
tion property of the helicity.

We ﬁnd that a big ﬁlament located at the periphery of a strong active region
undergoes a complicated partial and two-step eruption. The idea of two-step
energy release processes came from analyses of two-peak EUV light-curves of
some ﬂares (Woods et al., 2011; Su et al., 2012) suggesting that two peaks
in light-curves appear due to two stages of a single event associated with the
delayed eruption of a CME. Woods et al. (2011) and Su et al. (2012) presented
AIA EUV observations of the limb 8 March 2011 event in which a ﬂux rope
accelerated in the ﬁrst stage up to 120 km s−1, then the speed decreased to
14 km s−1, and in the second stage, started after 2 hrs after the beginning of
the event, it accelerated again and became the CME with a speed of ≈ 500
km s−1. Byrne et al. (2014) also analyzed this event and suggested that either
the kink-instability or the torus-instability of the ﬂux rope was the likeliest
scenario. Since the event was at the limb and photospheric magnetic-ﬁeld data
were not available for this time, the authors did not make strong conclusions
about the magnetic conﬁguration and were not very certain about the supposed
torus instability without calculation of the decay index. Gosain et al. (2016)
studied a two-step eruption of a quiescent ﬁlament on 22 October 2011. It was
observed from diﬀerent viewpoints by SDO, SOHO, and STEREO. The CME
associated with the ﬁlament eruption and two bright ribbons in the chromosphere
both appeared 15 hrs after the start of the event. Computation of the decay index
showed that there were zones of stability and instability that alternated in the

corona. Below 100 Mm the equilibrium was stable, then the zone of instability
followed from 100 to 500 Mm and gave place to a zone of stability again. Above
a height of 600 Mm the PIL disappeared, which hinted at the possibility for
the ﬂux rope to lose the horizontal equilibrium and erupt. These results showed
the possible scenario of the two-step eruption conﬁrmed by observations and
calculations. However, the ﬂux rope was not clearly observed in the intermediate
position and the magnetic ﬁeld calculations at great heights, above 400 Mm, were
not too reliable.

The event on 14–15 March 2015 we analyze in this paper happens when the
initial ﬁlament is in positon favorable for observations somewhere between the
central meridian and the limb. This allowes us to have reliable photospheric
magnetic-ﬁeld data and to observe the ascending trajectory of the eruptive
ﬁlament. The disadvantage is the absence of STEREO observations from an-
other point of view, but we use the rather reliable method of measuring of the
ﬁlament spine height on the disk. Our calculations of the decay index of the
coronal magnetic ﬁeld show that after the ﬁrst loss of equilibrium a part of the
ﬁlament ﬁnds itself within the zone of stability, but not far from the threshold of
instability. The strong disturbance that comes from the inner parts of the active
region force the ﬁlament to enter into the second step of the eruption.

Wang et al. (2016) studied the ﬁlament eruption on 15 March 2015 as the
source of the strong geomagnetic storm of Solar Cycle 24. They analyzed the
second step of the eruption because it was this event that produced the fast CME
that together with another CME started 12 hrs earlier drove the geomagnetic
storm. They calculated the decay index n in the region using the potential-ﬁeld
source-surface (PFSS) model. They found that n reached the critical value 1.5
for the onset of the torus instability at a height of approximately 118 Mm and
concluded that the strapping ﬁeld was strong enough to prevent any eruption
of both the southern and western ﬁlaments. If their decay index calculation is
averaged over the whole active region it is similar to our result shown in Figure
5f. They related the abrupt acceleration of the southern ﬁlament around 01:15
UT to the passage of the ﬁlament into the region with open magnetic ﬁeld,
which did not further conﬁne the ﬁlament. However, it is diﬃcult to derive the
true location of the ﬁlament rather high in the corona from images in only one
projection.

In our study, we perform the analysis of the ﬁlament ﬁrst-step activation
on March 14 and the second step eruption on March 15. We explain this as
follows, propogating a scenario based on more accurate magnetic ﬁeld calcula-
tions. Our conclusions are based on the detailed distribution of the decay index
over the active region. We deﬁne the critical height from values of the decay
index in the places where the ﬁlament could be located and is really located.
The distribution of the decay index provides an opportunity for the two-step
eruption. The estimated heights of the ﬁlaments show that the western ﬁlament
is within the zone of stability during all times of observation. That is why it keeps
its position despite the strong disturbance and intensive internal motions. The
southern ﬁlament is close to the threshold of stability during all time before the
abrupt acceleration in the second step. Very likely the eastern part of the initial
ﬁlament becomes slightly unstable at the beginning of the ﬁrst step. It moves

rather slowly in the direction of the zone of stability and is able to ﬁnd a new
position for stable equilibrium there. However, it is also close to the threshold of
stability and the next disturbance from the active region causes the full eruption.
