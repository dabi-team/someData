ABSTRACT

Context. The Evershed eﬀect, a nearly horizontal outﬂow of material seen in the penumbrae of sunspots at the photospheric layers,
is a common characteristic of well-developed penumbrae, but is still not well understood. Even less is known about photospheric
horizontal inﬂows in the penumbra, also known as counter Evershed ﬂows.
Aims. Here we present a rare feature observed in the penumbra of the main sunspot of AR NOAA 10930. This spot displays the normal
Evershed outﬂow in most of the penumbra, but harbors a fast photospheric inﬂow of material over a large sector of the disk-center
penumbra. We investigate the driving forces of both, the normal and the counter Evershed ﬂows.
Methods. We invert the spectropolarimetric data from Hinode SOT/SP using the SPINOR 2D inversion code, which allows us to derive
height-dependent maps of the relevant physical parameters in the sunspot. These maps show considerable ﬁne structure. Similarities
and diﬀerences between the normal Evershed outﬂow and the counter Evershed ﬂow are investigated.
Results. In both, the normal and the counter Evershed ﬂows, the material ﬂows from regions of weak (∼ 1.5 kG to ∼ 2 kG) to stronger
ﬁelds. The sources and sinks of both penumbral ﬂows display opposite ﬁeld polarities; with the sinks (tails of ﬁlaments) harboring
local enhancements in temperature, which are nonetheless colder than their sources (heads of ﬁlaments).
Conclusions. The anti-correlation of the gradients in the temperature and magnetic pressure between the endpoints of the ﬁlaments
from the two distinct penumbral regions is compatible with both the convective driver and the siphon ﬂow scenarios. A geometrical
scale of the parameters is necessary to determine which the dominant force driving the ﬂows is.

1. Introduction

The penumbrae of sunspots are strongly magnetized media (with
ﬁeld strengths of ∼1 to 2 kG) where convection is expected
to be almost completely suppressed according to simple es-
timates (Biermann 1941; Cowling 1953; Meyer et al. 1974;
Jahn & Schmidt 1994). Consequently, the penumbral bright-
ness is expected to be much lower than the observed one,
which is ∼75-80 % that of the quiet Sun, integrated over wave-
length. This fact points towards some level of convection tak-
ing place in the penumbra to account for its observed bright-
ness. However, how the energy is transported in the penum-
bra is still one of the major open questions in solar physics.
Detailed reviews pointing out this open problem and provid-
ing discussions on some proposed solutions have been given
by, e. g., Solanki (2003); Thomas & Weiss (2004, 2008); Bor-
rero (2009); Scharmer (2009); Schlichenmaier (2009); Tritschler
(2009); Bellot Rubio (2010); Borrero & Ichimoto (2011); Rem-
pel & Schlichenmaier (2011).

The ﬁlamentary structure of the penumbra might provide
one of the main clues to gaining insight into this question. The
penumbral magnetic ﬁeld consists of two major components.
The ﬁrst are spines, seen as relatively dark regions where the

magnetic ﬁeld is stronger and more vertical. The others are in-
traspines/ﬁlaments, seen as elongated bright channels where the
magnetic ﬁeld is weaker and more horizontal (see review by Bor-
rero & Ichimoto 2011).

Various models have been proposed to account for the ﬁla-
mentary structure of the penumbra. One of these, the embedded
ﬂux tube, is empirical in nature and was proposed by Solanki &
Montavon (1993). This model mainly describes the complex 3-
D structure of the ﬁeld to explain asymmetric Stokes V proﬁles.
According to it, nearly horizontal magnetic ﬂux tubes forming
the intraspines are embedded in more vertical background mag-
netic ﬁelds (spines) in the penumbra. The downward pumping
mechanism (Thomas et al. 2002) was proposed to explain the
origin of ﬁeld lines that return into the solar surface at the outer
penumbra. Another idea to account for the penumbral ﬁlaments
is the ﬁeld-free gap model (Choudhuri 1986; Scharmer & Spruit
2006; Spruit & Scharmer 2006), where the penumbral bright ﬁl-
aments are described as regions where the vertical component
of the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes as a result of the interaction with
the non-magnetized gas that rises due to convection into a back-
ground with more oblique ﬁelds.

These models concentrate on the conﬁguration of the mag-
netic ﬁeld in the penumbra. However, the appearance of a

penumbra is always associated with a distinctive gas ﬂow, i.e.,
the Evershed ﬂow (EF; Evershed 1909) and, therefore, this must
also be taken into account by these models. The EF is the most
prominent dynamic phenomenon in sunspots: An outward di-
rected ﬂow observed in the photospheric layers of penumbrae
with speeds of several km s−1 and large inclinations to the verti-
cal. This phenomenon is thought to be closely related to the ﬁl-
amentary structure of the penumbra (e. g., Borrero & Ichimoto
2011) and given its ubiquity, it is expected to play a central role
in the energy transport in the penumbrae of sunspots.

The EF is usually observed as a blueshift of photospheric
spectral lines in the disk-center-side part of the penumbra and
a corresponding redshift in the limb-side part of the penumbra.
This is generally interpreted as a radial, nearly horizontal out-
ﬂow of matter. The EF is height dependent: in the photosphere
the line shifts decrease rapidly with height of line formation (St.
John 1913; Maltby 1964; Börner & Kneer 1992). Moreover, in
the chromosphere the line shifts change sign (inverse EF), with
the center-side part of the penumbra now showing redshifts (St.
John 1913; Börner & Kneer 1992; Tsiropoula 2000). This is
taken to be the signature of an inﬂow of material. Most of the
mass ﬂowing outwards in the photosphere returns to the solar in-
terior within the penumbra, in opposite polarity downﬂow chan-
nels (Westendorp Plaza et al. 1997, 2001), although a part of the
Evershed ﬂow continues in the canopy of the sunspot (Solanki
et al. 1994).

The origin and driving physical mechanisms of the EF have
been subject of considerable controversy for decades. Some
models describe it as a siphon ﬂow driven by a gas pressure
diﬀerence between the footpoints of arched magnetic ﬂux tubes
(Meyer & Schmidt 1968; Thomas & Weiss 1992; Montesinos
& Thomas 1997; Thomas et al. 2006); while, in others, the EF is
explained as a ﬂow along magnetic ﬂux tubes driven by a form of
convection (Jahn & Schmidt 1994; Schlichenmaier et al. 1998;
Schlichenmaier & Solanki 2003). According to a more recent
proposal by Scharmer & Spruit (2006), the EF takes place in
ﬁeld-free gaps below the penumbral ﬁeld.

Recent 3-D MHD simulations for penumbral ﬁne structure
(Heinemann et al. 2007; Rempel et al. 2009a,b; Rempel &
Schlichenmaier 2011; Rempel 2011, 2012) display a ﬂow very
similar to the EF. In such simulations the EF has typically been
interpreted to be a consequence of overturning convection: the
hot gas rising from below the surface is deﬂected by the inclined
magnetic ﬁeld of the penumbra, producing a fast ﬂow toward
the sunspot border. Part of the rising gas turns over laterally and
dips down below the solar surface. The convective cells are then
elongated in the preferred direction imposed by the magnetic
ﬁeld (the radial direction), forming penumbral ﬁlaments with a
fast Evershed outﬂow along their axes and weaker downﬂows to-
wards their sides, much in the same way as in quiet sun granules.
The relative importance of various forces for driving the EF
is still a matter of debate. The reason is that along a ﬁlament
harboring a ﬂow, both the temperature and the magnetic ﬁeld
show the correct sign of the gradient along the ﬁlament (Tiwari
et al. 2013).

In this paper, we report and study the characteristics of an
atypical photospheric inﬂow observed by Hinode SOT/SP over
a considerable sector of the penumbra in the main sunspot of
NOAA AR 10930. Observations of photospheric counter Ever-
shed ﬂows have been reported rather rarely, and are usually re-
stricted to very narrow channels (see, e. g., Kleint & Sainz Dalda
2013; Louis et al. 2014), or are transient during the formation
phase of the penumbra, (see e. g., Schlichenmaier et al. 2012;
Romano et al. 2014; Murabito et al. 2016). The observation of

such a large inﬂowing region in a fully developed penumbra is
to our knowledge unique. By comparing the properties of the
anomalous counter EF with the well-known photospheric Ever-
shed outﬂow, we hope to learn more about the drivers of both
ﬂows.

This work is organized as follows: In section 2 we describe
our data and inversion technique. In section 3, results are pre-
sented and are discussed in section 4. Finally, in section 5 we
draw our conclusions.

2. Observational data and analysis techniques

2.1. Observations

For our study, we utilize spectropolarimetric observations in the
Fe I 6301.5 and 6302.5 Å lines from the Hinode spectropo-
larimeter of the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT/SP) (Kosugi et al.
2007; Lites 2007; Ichimoto et al. 2008; Lites et al. 2013) of the
main sunspot of the active region (AR) NOAA 10930 on De-
cember 08, 2006 (see Figure 1). The SOT/SP provided us with a
full-Stokes dataset with a spatial sampling of ∼ 0.16(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel while
operating in normal mode (see Lites et al. (2013) for a detailed
description of the SP instrument).

The sunspot umbra displays a negative magnetic polarity. It
was observed at (S91(cid:48)(cid:48), W698(cid:48)(cid:48)), i.e. at an heliocentric angle
θ ≈ 47◦. The observations were reduced with the correspond-
ing routines of the Solar-Soft package (Lites & Ichimoto 2013).

2.2. Inversions

We infer the atmospheric properties of the sunspot by inverting
the observational data with the spatially coupled version (van
Noort 2012) of the SPINOR inversion code (Frutiger et al. 2000)
which uses the STOPRO routines (Solanki 1987) to solve the ra-
diative transfer equations for polarized light under the assump-
tion of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

The inversion code calculates the best ﬁt full-Stokes spec-
tra of an atmospheric model described by a selected number of
atmospheric parameters, speciﬁed at a number of optical depth
positions, and interpolated using a bicubic spline approximation.
The spatially coupled version is able to invert the observed data
while taking into account the spatial degradation introduced by
the telescope diﬀraction pattern. Simultaneously it keeps the at-
mospheric model as simple as possible. The atmospheric param-
eters returned by the code provide the best ﬁts to the Stokes pro-
ﬁles in the absence of the blurring eﬀect of telescope diﬀraction.
The inversion is performed on a denser spatial grid than that
of the original data. The resulting inverted parameters have a
signiﬁcantly improved spatial resolution in most ﬁts and appear
to produce a more robust inversion result than at the original
pixel size (van Noort et al. 2013). Here we use a pixel size of
0.08(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel, a factor 2 smaller than in the original data, allowing
structures down to the diﬀraction limit of the telescope to be
adequately resolved. The returned parameters show small-scale
structures sharper than in the original data to the extent allowed
by noise (see van Noort (2012); van Noort et al. (2013) for details
and a discussion of the results of equivalent inversions of similar
Hinode/SP data).

The inverted parameters are temperature T , magnetic ﬁeld
strength B, ﬁeld inclination relative to the line-of-sight γLOS ,
line-of-sight velocity vLOS , and a micro-
ﬁeld azimuth φ,
turbulent velocity vMIC. All the free parameters were allowed
to vary at all three height nodes, which were placed at log(τ) =

(a) shows the continuum intensity Ic normalized to the mean continuum value in the quiet sun, IQS . Panels (b), (c) and (d) show the
maps of the Stokes parameters Q, U and V, respectively, normalized to local Ic. The Stokes Q, U and V maps were constructed at
−0.1Å from the 6302.5 Å line core (the selected wavelength is indicated by vertical green lines in Figure 2). The umbra-penumbra
boundary (black solid contour) was placed at Ic/IQS = 0.26 and the external penumbral boundary (black dashed contour) is at
Ic/IQS = 0.94. The cyan arrows point towards the disk center. Red markers show three selected pixels, one located in the limb-side
penumbra (‘*’), and two located in the center-side penumbra (‘x’ and ‘+’, respectively); their corresponding Stokes proﬁles are
shown in Figures 2a, 2b and 2c, respectively. The yellow cross shows a pixel close to the inner penumbral boundary where the
inversions give B > 7 kG at log(τ) = 0 and whose Stokes proﬁles are shown in Figure 2d

0.0, −0.8 and −2.0, respectively. The stratiﬁcations are then ex-
trapolated linearly above log(τ) = −2.0 up to log(τ) = −4.0, and
below log(τ) = 0 down to log(τ) ∼ 1.3.

The inversion returns very large ﬁeld strengths, in excess of 7
kG, in about 200 pixels located near the umbra/penumbra bound-
ary of the center-side penumbra (see e.g. yellow markers on Fig-
ure 5b). Figure 2d shows the observed Stokes proﬁles (dashed
lines) in one of those pixels (yellow marker on the maps of Fig-

ure 1). These proﬁles are highly complex since they exhibit large
asymmetries and multi-lobed Stokes V proﬁles, which causes
their best-ﬁts from the inversion to be not nearly as good as in
most of the penumbral pixels. The SPINOR 2D best-ﬁts to these
proﬁles (solid red lines) feature very large line-of-sight velocities
and magnetic ﬁeld strengths at all three height nodes in order to
reproduce the large wavelength separation in terms of the Zee-
man splitting: vLOS ∼ 9.3 km s−1 and B ∼ 8.3 kG at log(τ) = 0.

side penumbra (red ‘x’, red ‘+’ and yellow ‘+’ in Figure 1, respectively) in the same format as in (a). The SPINOR 2D best ﬁts of
proﬁles in panel (d) give B ∼ 6.4, 8.0 and 8.3 kG, γ ∼ 141, 148 and 145◦, and vLOS ∼ 5.6, 8.3 and 9.3 km s−1 at log(τ) = −2.0, −0.8
and 0, respectively, with χ2 = 14.

These unusually strong penumbral magnetic ﬁelds are not
new, as they have been previously observed in supersonic
penumbral downﬂows (van Noort et al. 2013). However, they
show up only when a spatially coupled inversion is performed
and their reality needs to be conﬁrmed with other techniques. To
examine the reliability of the inversions in the pixels with very
large ﬁeld strengths is not the main aim of this work. We instead
exclude in the present analysis all those pixels where the inver-
sion gives B > 7 kG.

Also, it is an intrinsic problem of inversions to specify errors
in the ﬁtted atmospheric parameters. Especially in the case of the

2D coupled inversions, the changes in the parameters of a single
pixel severely aﬀect the result, and therefore the error, of the
neighboring pixels. This fact makes the computation of formal
errors for a single pixel impossible. We stress that the main error
of inversions is not the formal error in one pixel resulting from
the minimization procedure, but is introduced by the choice of
the correct model atmosphere. The best error estimate therefore
can be provided by comparing the results from diﬀerent model
atmospheres. Such an analysis is beyond the scope of this work
and will be presented in detail in another publication. Prelimi-
nary results of this analysis indicate that strong magnetic ﬁeld

values of 5 kG and even ∼ 6 kG represent a valid solution for
the ﬁt to the Stokes proﬁles in multiple models, and that models
returning magnetic ﬁelds larger than 7 kG provide the best ﬁt to
the observed proﬁles.

Finally, after the inversion, the 180◦ azimuthal ambiguity
was resolved using the Non-Potential Magnetic Field Compu-
tation method (NPFC; Georgoulis 2005), which determines the
non-potential component of the ﬁeld to minimize the vertical
current density Jz. The NPFC code also converts the values of
magnetic ﬁeld inclination and azimuth from the line-of-sight
(LOS) frame into the local reference frame (LRF). This step
helps to determine the correct inclination and azimuth of the ﬁeld
in the LRF and is helpful for interpreting our results. However,
we are aware that disambiguation techniques may not give reli-
able results at the small scales studied in this paper. Some of the
reasons why such techniques may fail are: 1) the smallest struc-
tures we are studying have a horizontal dimension that is simi-
lar to the vertical corrugation of the τ = 1 surface. This invali-
dates the general assumption of disambiguation techniques that
the ﬁeld was measured on a ﬂat surface. 2) Electric currents (e.g.
current sheets at boundaries of ﬁlaments) are likely not properly
resolved and thus may be underestimated. This may inﬂuence
the results of techniques that aim to minimize the non-potential
part of the ﬁeld, such as the technique of Georgoulis (2005). 3)
In the highly dynamic environment of the penumbra, with its
waves, supersonic ﬂows, chromospheric jets, etc., it is not clear
if a minimization of the current really makes sense at the scales
we are studying in the photosphere. These caveats must be borne
in mind when considering the results in the LRF.

3. Results

In Figure 1, we show normalized maps of the Stokes parame-
ters in the sunspot from a single SOT/SP scan. Except for the
additional umbral-like feature in the bottom part of the maps,
and its corresponding penumbral-like extension (S olar X ≈
[−666(cid:48)(cid:48), −634(cid:48)(cid:48)], S olar Y ≈ [−126(cid:48)(cid:48), −115(cid:48)(cid:48)]), which we do not
study in this work, the well-developed penumbra surrounding
the main umbra of this sunspot seems, at ﬁrst sight, quite nor-
mal: it shows quasi-radial ﬁlamentary structures all around the
sunspot, and it is observed within a range of continuum intensi-
ties of 26 − 94% that of the average quiet Sun.

However, a more careful inspection through the individual
Stokes proﬁles at diﬀerent places within the penumbra reveals
an anomalous aspect: while it is possible to observe the nor-
mal EF (NEF), i. e., the photospheric absorption lines over the
limb-side and the disk-center-side penumbrae are redshifted and
blueshifted, respectively, indicating motions away from and to-
wards the observer (see, e. g., Stokes proﬁles in Figures 2a and
2b, respectively), strong redshifts are also observed over a broad
portion of the center-side penumbra (see, e. g., Stokes proﬁles in
Figure 2c), indicating a counter EF (CEF).

The existence of the CEF in the center-side penumbra be-
comes clearer after the inversions, since most of the observed
line proﬁles from the center-side penumbra show the same mag-
netic polarity (i. e. same signs of the Stokes V proﬁles) and dif-
fer from those in the NEF region only in more subtle ways such
as in the line shifts and asymmetries. Nonetheless, the Stokes
maps in Figures 1a, 1b and 1c suggest that the penumbral ﬁl-
aments in the CEF region have a slightly diﬀerent orientation
(not completely radially oriented) compared to that in the undis-
turbed other parts of the penumbra (which contain more radially
oriented ﬁlaments).

Figure 3 shows some of the resulting maps of the physical
parameters inverted with SPINOR 2D at three continuum opti-
cal depth levels, log(τ) = −2.0, −0.8 and 0 displayed from left
to right. From the vLOS maps (third row), it is possible to ob-
serve the NEF, i. e., the limb-side and center-side penumbrae
are redshifted and blueshifted, respectively. Additionally, as in-
dicated by the black thick contours, the CEF is observed over a
rather large area of the center-side penumbra, which mostly con-
tains positive vLOS values indicating motions away from the ob-
server. Such motions, because of their center-side location close
to the symmetry line (line connecting the sunspot’s center with
the disk-center), represent either downward motions of material
or inﬂows directed from the outer penumbra towards the umbra
of the sunspot.

Both, the NEF and the CEF are observed at all three selected
atmospheric layers. The largest blueshifts are observed at the
deepest observable layer (log(τ) = 0) in the center-side NEF
penumbra, with associated velocities (in the line-of-sight direc-
tion) that reach values of up to vLOS ∼ −15 km s−1. The largest
redshifts are located at the innermost part of the CEF penumbra
(towards the umbra-penumbra boundary). These redshifts also
become stronger with depth, corresponding to extreme veloci-
ties (vLOS > 20 km s−1) and exceeding even the ones found by
van Noort et al. (2013) in peripheral downﬂows within sunspot
penumbrae (vLOS ∼ 22 km s−1).

The inverted maps in Figure 3 do not show a clear diﬀer-
ence in temperature between the part of the penumbra showing
a NEF and the one harboring the CEF, in any of the three atmo-
spheric layers. However, at all three layers, the magnetic ﬁeld
strength appears to be larger at the inner part of the CEF penum-
bra than in any part of the NEF penumbra. Moreover, the inver-
sions give values B > 5 kG in some regions located in the in-
nermost part of the CEF penumbra (see cyan contours in Figure
5a). In particular, those regions contain pixels, located exactly
at the umbral/penumbral boundary (see yellow markers in Fig-
ure 5b), where B > 7 kG according with the inversions. Such
ﬁeld strengths, apart from being extremely high compared with
typical penumbral ﬁeld strengths, are also stronger than the um-
bral ﬁeld itself (the umbral ﬁeld at log(τ) = 0 has a local maxi-
mum close to the umbra’s geometric center as indicated by black
crosses in the magnetic ﬁeld maps of Figure 3, where B ∼ 3.9
kG, although some pixels close to the center-side umbral bound-
ary reach values up to B ∼ 4.2 kG).

Figure 4 shows the ﬁeld inclination γ and azimuth φ in both,
the LOS frame and LRF. The transformation of the magnetic
ﬁeld vector to the LRF suggests that the CEF region has diﬀerent
magnetic properties than the rest of the penumbra given that, at
all three heights, the magnetic ﬁeld lies more horizontally within
the enclosed penumbral sector harboring the CEF, even changing
polarity in the outer penumbra at log(τ) = −0.8 and −2. The
maps of γLRF also show a number of patches of opposite polarity
to that of the sunspot’s umbra, in the center-side penumbra at all
three optical depth levels. They are found mainly at the outer
penumbral boundary in both, the center-side NEF and the CEF
regions, although there are many more opposite polarity patches
concentrated closer to the outer penumbra in the CEF region.
We can also see this in Figure 5a, where green contours have
been placed on the continuum intensity map for the center-side
penumbra enclosing regions where γLRF < 90◦ at log(τ) = 0 and
the amplitude of Stokes V is at least 10σ.

The overall variation of vLOS , T and B with height in the CEF
part of the penumbra is similar to that of the NEF part: they all in-
crease with depth (see Figure 3). Nevertheless, in the anomalous
region, vLOS and B are observed to reach more extreme values. In

particular, in the inner penumbra of the CEF region vLOS > 20
km s−1 and B > 5 kG are observed at log(τ) = 0. Such high
values of vLOS and B are atypical in the penumbrae of sunspots,
with the closest values to these being those reported by van Noort
et al. (2013). Even more, ﬁeld strengths B > 7 kG are unusual
even for a dark umbra (see Livingston & Harvey 2006). We do
not include the pixels where B > 7 kG in the following analysis.
Instead, we plan to conduct a more detailed study on the reality
of unusually strong ﬁelds found in sunspots penumbrae. This is
beyond the scope of this paper and will be the topic of a future
work.

3.1. Filament Selection
In order to compare the diﬀerences and/or similarities between
the ﬁne-scale structures related to the CEF and the NEF, we in-
vestigate now the generic properties of the ﬁlaments that popu-
late the three penumbral regions identiﬁed in Figure 6. For this,
we manually selected 6 ﬁlaments from each of these penumbral
regions.

The individual ﬁlaments were selected based on selection
criteria introduced by Tiwari et al. (2013), but adapted to a
sunspot located oﬀ the disk center (θ ≈ 47◦). In our selection
criteria, we use the temperature, the ﬁeld inclination angle and
the line-of-sight velocity, at log(τ) = 0, as follows: (1) the heads

Article number, page 8 of 17

of the ﬁlaments are identiﬁed by relatively warm upﬂows and
nearly vertical magnetic ﬁelds; (2) the bodies of the ﬁlaments
are characterized by more horizontal ﬁelds and by the signature
of the Evershed ﬂow in vLOS due to the large heliocentric angle
of the sunspot; (3) the tails of the ﬁlaments are localized in re-
gions of concentrated downﬂows and of nearly vertical ﬁelds of
opposite polarity to the umbra.

The selection procedure was applied manually by placing
points along the central axis of the ﬁlament. A line connecting
these points was then computed using a bi-cubic spline interpo-
lation. The path deﬁned in this way deﬁnes the possibly curved
axis, or spine of the ﬁlament and was used in the de-stretching
and length normalization of the ﬁlament.

To perform the de-stretching and length normalization, 200
equidistant points were placed along the axis of each ﬁlament,
after which ten points on a line perpendicular to the tangent are
placed at intervals of one pixel (0.08(cid:48)(cid:48)) on each side of the path.
A cubic interpolation of the inverted parameters in these points
results in a de-stretched, de-rotated and length normalized ﬁl-
ament, as shown in Figure 7 for two individual ﬁlaments, one
from the center-side NEF and one from the CEF penumbral re-
gions.

With the method described above, a total of 18 penumbral
ﬁlaments were selected and de-stretched, 6 inside each of the
three penumbral regions highlighted in Figure 6. Our original

aim was to select equal numbers of ﬁlaments located in the in-
ner, middle, and outer parts of the penumbra within each high-
lighted region. Due to geometrical constraints introduced when
using γ as a selection parameter, it turned out to be most reliable
to identify ﬁlaments in the inner penumbra in the limb-side NEF
region. Likewise, all selected ﬁlaments in the center-side NEF
region lie in the outer penumbra. In contrast, the ﬁlaments in the
CEF region turned out to be much longer; most of them extend
over the whole penumbral width, i. e., they originate close to the
boundary between penumbra and quiet Sun (i. e. this is where the
upﬂow in these ﬁlaments is located) and end at the edge of the
umbra. Such a positional diﬀerence between the ﬁlaments from
each group should, however, not prevent us from performing a
qualitative comparison between the ﬁlaments from the 3 regions,
since, according to Tiwari et al. (2013), all ﬁlaments have essen-
tially the same structure independently of their location within
the penumbra, with the biggest diﬀerences happening in their
surroundings.

Table 1 shows the mean, the standard deviation and the me-
dian values of the length distributions for each of the selected
ﬁlament sets in the penumbra. Strikingly, the CEF-carrying ﬁla-
ments are nearly twice as long as those hosting the NEF.

Given the range of lengths of ﬁlaments from each selected
region, they are rescaled prior to averaging. It is important to
keep in mind that while averaging, the variation in the length
will cause some properties to be re-scaled along the ﬁlament.
Nonetheless, the generic physical properties and structure, re-
ﬂected by the average of such ﬁlaments, should be valid for ﬁla-
ments of all sizes.

Thus, after de-stretching and length normalizing all the se-
lected ﬁlaments we separately averaged each 6-ﬁlament set in or-
der to highlight their common characteristics, producing a "stan-

the ﬁlament’s endpoints: inner or closer to the umbra (left) and

dard" ﬁlament for each of the three selected parts of the penum-
bra. This reduces the large variability in the appearance of the
ﬁlaments caused by interactions with the environment as well as
due to their intrinsic variability. Thus we ﬁnally just analyzed the
above three standard or averaged ﬁlaments, one for each penum-
bral region marked in Figure 6.

The width of the ﬁlaments is, unlike their lengths, not re-
scaled. The width values shown in Table 1 were computed by
averaging the continuum intensity along the axes of the 3 av-
eraged ﬁlaments. As shown in Figure 8, they come out to be
roughly 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48), 0.8(cid:48)(cid:48) and 1(cid:48)(cid:48) for the center-side NEF, limb-side

izontal but slightly downward pointing ﬁeld along the body (i.
e. with the same polarity as the umbra), while the tail displays
an opposite ﬁeld polarity to that observed at the head, i. e. up-
ward pointing ﬁeld lines. This ﬁeld conﬁguration is maintained
after transforming γ to the LRF, i. e., the transformation gives
γLRF ∼ 140◦ in the head, ∼ 110◦ along the body and ∼ 60◦ in the
tail.

The LOS velocity shows strong blueshifts (vLOS ∼ −5 km
s−1) concentrated in the head of the center-side ﬁlament, and
weaker blueshifts (vLOS ∼ −2 km s−1) that continue in a thin
band along the central axis of the ﬁlament. In contrast, large red-
shifts (vLOS > 5 km s−1) appear concentrated in the tail. This
can also be clearly seen in Figure 10, where the thermal, the
magnetic and the velocity proﬁles along the central axes of the
three average ﬁlaments are plotted (the corresponding cuts are
indicated by horizontal dashed lines in Figure 9).

From Figures 9 and 10 one can ﬁnd various similarities be-
tween the center-side and the limb-side averaged NEF ﬁlaments:
the temperature at the head of the limb-side NEF ﬁlament is
roughly the same as in the center-side NEF case, and it drops
from the head towards the tail, while the magnetic ﬁeld suﬀers
a notable strengthening near the tail. As in the center-side NEF
ﬁlament, the limb-side NEF ﬁlament shows a slight temperature
increase at the tail with respect to the body, assuming tempera-
tures of up to ∼ 5800 K. The ﬁeld strength reaches values up to
∼ 2.2 kG in the tail.

Figure 9 also shows that the ﬂow is mainly concentrated
along the body of the limb-side NEF ﬁlament, reaching veloc-
ities vLOS > 6 km s−1 in the tail. Note, however, that in this case
we do not observe ﬂows in the heads, likely because the orienta-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld is almost perpendicular to the LOS di-
rection in that region. Assuming that the ﬂow and the ﬁeld have
the same direction, no ﬂows could then be observed along the
LOS.

In addition, unlike in the center-side NEF case, the LOS in-
clination does not show the opposite ﬁeld polarity between the
head and the tail of the limb-side ﬁlament. Instead, we see in
the head γLOS ∼ 80◦, γLOS ∼ 40◦ − 50◦ along the body, and
γLOS ∼ 20◦ in the tail. Nonetheless, once the ﬁeld inclination is
transformed into the LRF, the opposite ﬁeld polarities between
the ﬁlament endpoints and a roughly horizontal ﬁeld along the
body are unveiled: γLRF ∼ 120◦ in the head (slightly downward
pointing ﬁeld), γLRF ∼ 80◦ along the body (almost horizontal
ﬁeld) and γLRF ∼ 60◦ in the tail (slightly upward pointing ﬁeld).
The slightly diﬀerent curvatures of the ﬁeld along the center-
side and limb-side NEF ﬁlaments, as seen in the LRF (see sketch
in Figure 12), cannot be attributed to their diﬀerent radial lo-
cations within the penumbra (outer and inner ﬁlaments, respec-
tively) since, according to the ﬁndings of Tiwari et al. (2013), the
ﬁeld inclination is remarkably independent of the location of the
ﬁlament, displaying only modest diﬀerences between ﬁlaments
at diﬀerent radial distances.

There are multiple possibilities for the diﬀerent curvatures
of the center-side and limb-side NEF ﬁlaments. One possibil-

NEF and CEF regions, respectively. Thus, from the average of
the measured lengths of the individual ﬁlaments, we arrive at a
length-to-width ratio of approximately 9, 6 and 10 for the center-
side NEF, limb-side NEF and CEF regions, respectively.

3.2. Qualitative picture of ﬁlaments

Figure 9 depicts a selection of properties of each of the three
averaged ﬁlaments, representing the selected penumbral region
(center-side NEF, limb-side NEF and CEF), at log(τ) = 0. We
concentrate on log(τ) = 0 since the important diﬀerences and
similarities between the averaged ﬁlaments are best seen there.

By comparing plots in Figure 9 with similar images of the
individual ﬁlaments (e. g. Figure 7) we can see that, averaging
6 ﬁlaments in each of the three groups is suﬃcient to clearly
highlight the common features of the ﬁlaments and to suppress
the largest individual ﬂuctuations.

3.2.1. center-side and limb-side NEF ﬁlaments

Figure 9 shows that the average ﬁlament from the center-side
NEF region starts with a strong peak in temperature (∼ 6400
K in the head). The temperature gradually decreases along the
body of the ﬁlament and increases again towards the tail, up to
∼ 6300 K. The magnetic ﬁeld strength also decreases from the
head towards the body from almost 1.9 kG to ∼ 1.3 kG, but then
shows a local large strengthening at the very tail up to almost 2.5
kG.

The LOS inclination angle suggests that the head of the
center-side ﬁlament has a downward pointing ﬁeld, a more hor-

ity is that we see somewhat diﬀerent heights in the center-side
and limb-side penumbra, as the ray passes through diﬀerent at-
mospheric structures so that a given optical depth is reached at
diﬀerent heights in the two geometries. There are also biases
introduced by the fact that Stokes V is typically signiﬁcantly
stronger than Stokes Q or U, so that a magnetic ﬁeld directed
(anti-) parallel to the LOS gives a larger contribution than one
that is directed perpendicular to the LOS. If there is a mixture of
unresolved ﬁelds with diﬀerent strengths and inclinations (or if
SPINOR does not remove all the stray light), then this introduces
a diﬀerence in the ﬁeld strength (compare B in the the heads and
tails of the two NEF ﬁlaments in Figures 9 and 10) and also in
the inclination. Finally, the penumbra may be intrinsically asym-
metric, with the body of the limb-side ﬁlaments formed by al-
most horizontal ﬁelds that are pointing inwards and slightly up-
wards, and the body of the center-side NEF ﬁlaments formed by
also inward directed almost horizontal ﬁelds but pointing slightly
downwards.

As expected, there are some remarkable diﬀerences seen in
the surroundings of the averaged ﬁlaments from the center-side
and limb-side NEF regions since they are the result of averaging
groups of outer and inner ﬁlaments, respectively, and the phys-
ical parameters partly change quite considerably from the inner
to the outer penumbra. Such diﬀerences are consistent with the
results of Tiwari et al. (2013) for the surrounding environment of
ﬁlaments located in the inner and outer penumbra. Even though
the temperature in the surroundings of the ﬁlaments increases
gradually with radial distance in both cases (i. e. when moving
from umbra to the quiet Sun), the environment of the ﬁlament
from the center-side NEF penumbra (outer ﬁlaments) is signiﬁ-
cantly hotter than in the limb-side NEF case (inner ﬁlaments). As
argued by Tiwari et al. (2013), the diﬀerences in the properties
of the surroundings are due to the variation of the spines with
radial distances. Such diﬀerences appear to have an important
eﬀect on the downstream temperature structure of the ﬁlaments
(tail of ﬁlament in center-side NEF region is hotter than the tail
in the limb-side case). This can be clearly seen in both, Figures
10 and 11. In the latter, various physical parameters are plotted
along 2 transversal cuts near the head (solid lines) and the tail
(dashed lines), indicated by vertical dashed lines in Figure 9.

Figure 11 also shows that the magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the
head of the limb-side NEF ﬁlament (inner ﬁlaments) is signiﬁ-
cantly stronger than inside the head of the ﬁlament. In contrast,
the magnetic ﬁeld strength surrounding the head of the center-
side NEF ﬁlament (outer ﬁlaments) is slightly weaker than the
ﬁeld strength inside the head. However, as clearly revealed by
Figures 10 and 11, the ﬁeld strength in the ﬁlament itself seems
to be very similar for both, the center-side and limb-side NEF
regions, independently of their diﬀerent radial locations. More-
over, the ﬁeld strength is ≥ 1 kG everywhere inside both NEF
ﬁlaments, and slightly larger than 2 kG in their tails.

3.2.2. CEF ﬁlaments

Figure 9 also shows that the endpoints of the averaged ﬁlament
from the CEF region are exchanged compared to the NEF case:
the ﬁlament endpoint closer to the umbra displays properties
similar to the tail of the NEF ﬁlaments but being even more
extreme, with a local large strengthening of the magnetic ﬁeld
(∼ 4.5 kG) and large redshifts that correspond to supersonic
line-of-sight velocities (vLOS > 9 km s−1); while the outer end-
point behaves as a head, being much hotter than its surroundings
and harboring concentrated blueshifts. This clear spatial anti-

one (closest to the umbra) as its tail.

correlation strongly suggests that the ﬁlaments in the CEF region
are "reversed ﬁlaments", with their heads located at their outer-
most endpoints and their tails at their umbral directed endpoints.

According to Figure 9, the head of the averaged ﬁlament
from the CEF region is followed by a thin band along the center
of the ﬁlament where relatively low and positive values of vLOS
are seen (note that the head lies close to the outer boundary of
the spot and the ﬁlament extends towards the umbra). The LOS
velocity gradually increases from head to tail along the central
axis of the ﬁlament, from ∼ 1 to ∼ 5 km s−1, which represents an
inﬂow towards the umbra (counter Evershed ﬂow) roughly along
horizontal magnetic ﬁeld lines (γLRF ∼ 90 − 110◦).

We interpret the observation of low vLOS values just after the
head of the ﬁlament to be a result of the viewing geometry. In
fact, the LOS velocity shows stronger redshifts around the head
and in the lateral edges immediately after the head than inside the
body of the ﬁlament (this is clearly visible mainly between 0.8

Article number, page 12 of 17

and 0.9 of the normalized x-position of Figure 9). Those lateral
redshifts are likely produced by lateral downﬂows occurring at
the edges of the ﬁlament where the ﬁeld is pointing downwards
(γLRF ∼ 140◦). The dominance of the lateral downﬂows on the
velocity transversal proﬁle of that region can also be explained
by the viewing geometry: there, the ﬁeld is more aligned to the
LOS direction (γLOS ∼ 150◦) than in those regions of weak red-
shifts along the central axis of the ﬁlament (where γLOS ∼ 110◦).

According to γLRF, the CEF would ﬂow almost horizontally
right after the head (γLRF ∼ 90◦), assuming a coupled bending of
the ﬁeld and the ﬂow immediately after the head. The tail in this
case shows strong, supersonic LOS ﬂows that we interpret as
downﬂows, which coincide spatially with a large enhancement
of the magnetic ﬁeld strength and with downward pointing ﬁelds
(γLRF ∼ 140◦).

3.2.3. Comparison between NEF and CEF ﬁlaments

Plots in Figure 10 disclose a qualitatively similar behavior of the
temperature, ﬁeld strength and line-of-sight velocity along the
central axes of the three averaged ﬁlaments, from the "heads"
towards the "tails".

In all three cases, there is a systematic decrease of the tem-
perature from the head towards the body of the ﬁlaments. De-
spite a local temperature increase in the tails, the heads are al-
ways hotter than the tails. This temperature diﬀerence is, ∆T ∼
800, 600 and 100 K for the CEF, limb-side NEF and center-side
NEF case, respectively . Also, in all three cases, the tails display
large to very large enhancements in the magnetic ﬁeld strength,
which, compared to the heads, give ∆B ∼ 3000, 600 and 300 G
for the CEF, center-side NEF and limb-side NEF case, respec-
tively. Note that, because the head of the CEF carrying ﬁlaments
is lying at the outer penumbra, a larger B value at its tail com-
pared with the head is expected because B is on average larger
by 1 − 1.5 kG near the umbra than at the outer penumbral bound-
ary (Solanki 2003; Tiwari et al. 2015). This explains most, if not
all of the diﬀerence in ∆B between CEF and NEF carrying ﬁl-

aments. Something also worth noticing is that the bodies of the
ﬁlaments are not ﬁeld free gaps, but they are actually magne-
tized with strengths above 1 kG everywhere in the penumbra, in
agreement with the ﬁndings of Tiwari et al. (2013).

In all three cases, there are concentrated ﬂows in the tails,
with vLOS > 5 km s−1. In particular, the tail of the standard ﬁla-
ment carrying the CEF displays supersonic velocities (vLOS > 9
km s−1). Such supersonic ﬂows might be contributing to the en-
hancements in temperature seen at the tails, maybe due to the
formation of shocks as suggested by Tiwari et al. (2013).

The LRF inclination angle proﬁles show opposite ﬁeld po-
larities between heads and tails in all three average ﬁlaments. To
help the reader visualize the magnetic conﬁguration of the aver-
age ﬁlaments at log(τ) = 0, in Figure 12 we have sketched the
magnetic ﬁeld inclination of the three average ﬁlaments, accord-
ing to the information provided by γLRF in the deepest visible
layer: the head of the center-side and limb-side NEF ﬁlaments
have both the same polarity as the umbra (γLRF ∼ 140◦ and 120◦,
respectively), while the CEF ﬁlament head has the opposite po-
larity (γLRF ∼ 50◦). Note that the magnetic ﬁeld displays roughly

of ﬂows being aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld, such a red-
shifted region in the center-side penumbra represents a counter-
Evershed ﬂow. We discard the possibility that these redshifts
could be produced by a nearly vertical downﬂow of plasma only,
due to the ﬁnding of an associated radial penumbral ﬁne struc-
ture (i. e. ﬁlamentary ﬁne structure) and further similarities with
the normal Evershed outﬂow. Nonetheless, the observation of
strong redshifts in regions with more vertical ﬁelds at the edges
of the ﬁlaments carrying the CEF suggests the existence of lat-
eral downﬂows channels.

The very large line shifts and line splittings observed in the
anomalous penumbral region, and the extensive area that the
CEF spans, make this sunspot a rather unique one. The previ-
ously reported observations of CEFs by, e. g., Kleint & Sainz
Dalda (2013); Louis et al. (2014) have been mainly restricted to
penumbral ﬁlaments of sunspots leading to ﬂares, or have been
found in forming penumbrae (Schlichenmaier et al. 2012; Ro-
mano et al. 2014; Murabito et al. 2016).

Kleint & Sainz Dalda (2013) propose two possible models
to explain the observation of CEFs in the photosphere. The ﬁrst
model is the umbral ﬁlament sheet model, in which the CEF
would occur along a topological feature in form of a sheet that
magnetically connects spatially separated regions (e. g., the um-
bra with a network element well outside the spot), the CEF is
then described as a siphon ﬂow produced by the pressure dif-
ference between the umbral base of the sheet and the magnet-
ically connected network element. The second model proposed
by Kleint & Sainz Dalda (2013) is the massive umbral ﬁlament
model, in which a thick ﬂux tube with higher density than the
penumbra carries the common chromospheric inverse EF, with
the NEF hidden below the ﬂux tube.

In our study, we have not analyzed the dynamics of the
anomalous part of the penumbra in the higher layers of the at-
mosphere. We have concentrated mainly on the deepest visible
layer (log(τ) = 0), where the sources of the CEF could be iden-
tiﬁed within the penumbra itself (at the outer border). On the
one hand, the fact that we see a CEF at the deepest observable
layers in an otherwise nearly normal photospheric penumbra, is
not compatible with the massive umbral ﬁlament model of Kleint
& Sainz Dalda (2013), which basically describes the CEF as a
chromospheric ﬂow. On the other hand, the fact that the CEF
begins and ends within the penumbra itself, is conﬂicting with
the umbral ﬁlament sheet model, which requires that the ﬂow is
driven from a network element. Also, we do not observe turbu-
lent motions in the boundary between the CEF and the NEF (per-
haps due to the spatial resolution), as would be expected in the
umbral ﬁlament sheet model. Instead, we observe that the CEF
is concentrated along penumbral channels, whose magnetic and
thermal structures strongly suggest that they are "inverted nor-
mal ﬁlaments" with their heads/ﬂow-sources located at the outer
penumbral boundary and the tails/ﬂow-sinks located in the inner
penumbral boundary.

Our analysis allows for two interpretations of the driver of
the CEF (and the NEF). One possible qualitative picture of the
CEF (and of the NEF) emerging from our analysis is that of a
siphon ﬂow driven by a gas pressure gradient due to diﬀerent
magnetic ﬁeld strengths at the two endpoints of the ﬂux tubes
forming the penumbral ﬁlaments in the anomalous region, in ac-
cordance with the model of Meyer & Schmidt (1968) for ex-
plaining the driving forces of the NEF.

We found a ﬁeld strength gradient of ∼ 3000 G between
the tail and the head of the averaged ﬁlament carrying the CEF
(∼ 300−600 G in the averaged ﬁlaments carrying the NEF). This
may contribute to the acceleration of the ﬂows since an enhanced

ing to γLRF at log(τ) = 0. Solid arrows represent the magnetic

the same general magnetic polarity in both the CEF and center-
side NEF parts of the penumbra when looking at both from the
umbra outwards. The anti-correlation between their γLRF proﬁles
at the heads and the tails of NEF and CEF, seen in Figures 10
and 11, is a result of plotting the ﬁlaments such that the heads (i.
e. upﬂows) are together. The diﬀerent radial position within the
penumbra of the center-side and limb-side NEF ﬁlaments (outer
and inner ﬁlaments, respectively) as well as the diﬀerent radial
extent of the CEF ﬁlaments, have been sketched in Figure 12.

From the plots in Figure 11, we can again ﬁnd consider-
able similarities in the behavior of the two endpoints of the av-
eraged ﬁlaments in diﬀerent sectors of the penumbra, with the
biggest diﬀerences being observed between their surroundings.
The plasma surrounding the tail of the CEF averaged ﬁlament is
substantially cooler than in the NEF cases. This is not surprising
since most of the ﬁlaments in the CEF region are seen to pen-
etrate into the umbra (see Figure 3) and consequently the tails
are located in a rather cool environment (which is even cooler
than the media surrounding the heads of the inner ﬁlaments in
the limb-side NEF region).

In summary, we could say that the ﬂows (both, the NEF
and the CEF) all start as upﬂows in the bright and hot head of
the ﬁlament containing them, where the ﬁeld is more vertical.
The material is then carried radially outwards/inwards along the
NEF/CEF ﬁlament’s axis. Along the way, the gas cools and ﬁ-
nally sinks again at the tails, where the gas is cooler than in the
heads and the ﬁeld is stronger.

4. Discussion

In the center-side penumbra, one would normally expect to
observe blue-shifts or plasma ﬂows directed towards the ob-
server due to the well-known photospheric Evershed eﬀect (Ev-
ershed 1909), a radial and almost horizontal outward-directed
ﬂow of material. However, the observed redshifts in a sector of
the center-side penumbra of the main spot of AR NOAA10930
caused by plasma motions pointing away from the observer, in-
dicate either inward directed motions (towards the umbra) or
downﬂows in the center-side penumbra. Under the assumption

ﬁeld in the tails implies a larger gas pressure in the head com-
pared to the tail. However, to validate this siphon ﬂow scenario,
we need to know if a pressure gradient exists between the end-
points of the ﬁlaments at the same gravitational potential, i. e., at
constant geometrical height. This is unfortunately not possible
to know since the present observations provide physical infor-
mation of constant optical depth layers only.

According to van Noort et al. (2013), the strongest ﬁelds
in penumbrae are usually found at the ends of complex ﬁla-
ments, particularly those with multiple heads that merge to form
a single tail. Those tails show a polarity opposite to that of the
sunspot umbra and contain supersonic downﬂows (≥ 9 km s−1).
van Noort et al. (2013) argue that the strong magnetic ﬁelds are
probably the result of intensiﬁcation of magnetic ﬁeld by the
collapse of magnetized ﬂux concentrations (e.g. Parker 1978).
In addition, the optical depth unity surface might be strongly de-
pressed at the tails of the ﬁlaments, exposing stronger ﬁelds from
a deeper geometrical height. In our study, we have only analyzed
simple ﬁlaments (with a single head and a single tail) carrying
the NEF and the CEF, respectively. The tails of these ﬁlaments
also contain enhanced ﬁeld strengths (B ∼ 2 − 2.5 kG on average
for the tails of NEF carrying ﬁlaments and B ∼ 4.5 kG on aver-
age for the tails of CEF carrying ﬁlaments), and are co-located
with fast downﬂows (within the subsonic regime for the NEF
case, vLOS ∼ 7 km s−1 on average; and with supersonic speeds
in the CEF case, vLOS > 9 km s−1). The mechanisms considered
by van Noort et al. (2013) are also a possible explanation for
the relation between the large downﬂow velocities and the en-
hanced magnetic ﬁeld strengths in our observations. Likewise, it
is possible that the enhanced ﬁeld strengths found in the tails of
the ﬁlaments carrying both the CEF and the NEF, correspond to
regions below the average geometrical height of the penumbra,
as proposed by van Noort et al. (2013) and Tiwari et al. (2013).
This could also explain the temperature enhancement found in
the tails of the ﬁlaments, since we might be seeing deeper and
hotter layers in the tails than in the other parts of the penumbra.
The supersonic downﬂows observed in the tails of the ﬁlaments
carrying the CEF might contribute to the increase in temperature
due to the formation of shocks.

In particular, we do not discard the possibility that the very
large magnetic ﬁeld values returned by the SPINOR 2D inver-
sions (B > 7 kG) are real and they are observed in the penumbra
due to an unusually depressed optical depth surface formed as
the consequence of very low densities in the downﬂowing part
of the anomalous penumbra harboring the CEF. However, given
that most of the pixels where SPINOR 2D returns B > 7 kG are
located at or close to the umbral/penumbral boundary of the CEF
region (see yellow markers in Figure 5b) and contain very com-

plex Stokes proﬁles (e. g. they exhibit a large wavelength sep-
aration, large asymmetries and multi-lobed Stokes V proﬁles),
it is also possible that those proﬁles are produced by multiple
(unresolved) atmospheric components with large diﬀerences in
their Doppler velocity. One of the components could be asso-
ciated with the umbral magnetic ﬁeld in the sunspot (where the
medium is nearly at rest) and the second one with the ﬁlamentary
penumbra (strongly red-shifted component). Very large Doppler
shifts as well as extremely strong magnetic ﬁelds could explain
the large wavelength separation observed at these peculiar pix-
els in the umbral/penumbral boundary. However, in order to get
insight on the nature of these complex proﬁles it is necessary to
perform a detailed analysis using e. g. some classical diagnostic
methods and diﬀerent inversion techniques considering diﬀerent
model atmospheres to see which one gives the most reliable re-
sults. This will be the topic of a future study.

The other possible driver compatible with our results is the
thermal gradient. The systematic temperature decrease from the
heads to the tails observed in all three averaged ﬁlaments (limb-
side NEF, center-side NEF and CEF) is compatible with the
convective driver scenario, as proposed by Scharmer & Spruit
(2006); Spruit & Scharmer (2006), but modiﬁed by the presence
of a magnetic ﬁeld since we observe ﬁeld strengths B > 1 kG in
the body of the ﬁlaments, similar to the ﬁndings of Tiwari et al.
(2013) in ﬁlaments carrying a NEF. In this scenario, the upﬂow-
ing hot gas reaches the solar surface due to the convective insta-
bility. There, the gas decelerates and builds up excess pressure.
Due to the generally radial and horizontal magnetic ﬁeld direc-
tion, the gas ﬂows to a large extent radially along the body of the
ﬁlaments. Along the way, the gas cools down and it eventually
sinks in the tails. This is in qualitative agreement with the results
of the simulations of Rempel et al. (2009a). Independently of
their opposite horizontal ﬂow direction, in both cases (NEF and
CEF), the relationship between the direction of ﬂow and the tem-
perature, with upﬂowing material being hotter than the down-
ﬂowing material, could provide support for the presence of over-
turning convection along the penumbral ﬁlaments. Furthermore,
since we might be seeing higher layers in the heads than in the
tails, the temperature diﬀerence at an equal geometrical height
between heads and tails should be considerably larger than the
observed (Bruls et al. 1999). However, the relevant physical pa-
rameters need to be known on a geometrical scale to conﬁrm this
scenario.

The various opposite ﬁeld polarity patches that are observed
outside but in the vicinity of the anomalous part of the penum-
bra, might be related with the initiation of the CEF, since this
is apparently the only aspect that distinguishes (in the surround-
ings) the part of the penumbra with CEF from the other parts of

the penumbra considered as normal. The lack of SP scans pre-
vents us from observing the exact time at which the CEF is ini-
tiated in the anomalous part of the penumbra. However, Hinode
observations of the G-band and narrow-band ﬁltergrams show
the presence of an adjacent pore with opposite magnetic polarity
to that of the umbra of the main sunspot prior to the analyzed
SP scan. This pore was located in the region where the oppo-
site polarity patches are observed in the present SP scan (green
contours in Figure 5a), which might be remnants of the pore.
A quick look into the temporal evolution of the pore in the G-
band images (see Figure 13) suggests that the pore develops a
penumbra-like connection with the main sunspot (visible in the
second frame). The CEF carrying part of the penumbra devel-
oped out of this initial connection. The third frame shows that
the penumbral ﬁlaments in the anomalous region grow while the
area of the pore decreases. Note that the location of the penum-
bral bright grains (red arrows in third frame) suggests that the
ﬁlaments originate in the pore and extend outwards, towards the
umbra of the main sunspot. Consequently, if a NEF is carried
along those ﬁlaments (from the pore outwards), that would mean
an inﬂow towards the umbra of the main sunspot in the AR, i. e.,
a CEF. The fourth frame shows that the area of the pore contin-
ues decreasing while the penumbral ﬁlaments grow, and ﬁnally,
in the last frame (which roughly corresponds to the time of the
analyzed SP scan) the pore has disappeared and the penumbral
ﬁlaments in the anomalous region seem to have been "adopted"
by the main sunspot of the AR while carrying a CEF.

Jurˇcak et al. (2017) also reported the evolution of a penumbra
at the boundary of a small pore, in which the penumbra seemed
to colonize the pore area leading to its extinction. They found
that the maximum value of the vertical component of the mag-
netic ﬁeld Bver in the pore was around 1.4 kG and argued that
a stable umbra-penumbra boundary could not be formed in that
case because the pore did not fulﬁll the canonical critical value
of Bver = 1.8 kG, empirically found by Jurˇcak (2011) and Ju-
rˇcak et al. (2015) to be a crucial value for the formation of a
stable umbra-penumbra boundary in a magneto-convective con-
text. In our case, we do not have enough information on the mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration in the pore during the formation process
of the anomalous penumbra due to the lack of SP scans during
those stages. Nonetheless, its evolution on the G-band images
looks in some aspects similar to the case studied in Jurˇcak et al.
(2017): the ﬁlaments seem to grow at the expense of the adja-
cent pore. However, an important diﬀerence is that in the case
studied by Jurˇcak et al. (2017), the penumbra ends up as an or-
phan penumbra once the pore has disappeared, i. e. the ﬁlaments
are not connected to any umbral region, while the anomalous
penumbra in our study is continually attached to the umbra of
the main sunspot.

The evolution of the anomalous penumbra in AR 10930 is
associated with high chromospheric activity. The study of the
associated chromospheric and coronal dynamics, from the time
of the AR’s ﬁrst appearance over the solar west limb on 2006-
12-06 until the disappearance of the CEF on 2006-12-09 when
the center-side penumbra shows the NEF only, might provide
us with important information on how the anomalous penumbra
was formed and the CEF maintained during a couple of days
before reversing into a NEF. This will be the topic of a future
work.

5. Conclusion

AR NOAA 10930 on 2006-12-08 06:11:14 UT, at photospheric
heights. This is, to our knowledge, a unique observation of a
counter Evershed ﬂow (CEF) at the photospheric heights cover-
ing a sizable part of the penumbra of a mature sunspot.

By using the SPINOR 2D code to invert spectropolarimetric
data of the sunspot from the Hinode SOT/SP instrument, we in-
vestigated the characteristics of the CEF in the photosphere and
have compared them with the physical properties of the normal
Evershed ﬂow (NEF) in the same sunspot.

The results found here are consistent with both scenarios,
namely that the temperature gradient or the magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dient is the main driver of both, the normal Evershed ﬂow and
of the anomalous or counter Evershed ﬂow. This implies that we
cannot distinguish between the convective driver and the siphon
ﬂow scenarios. However, this result suﬀers from the shortcom-
ings of present observations and analysis techniques: the inabil-
ity to peer below the solar surface and the lack of knowledge of
the true geometrical height scale.

A comparison of our results with recent high-resolution
sunspot simulations that display a NEF in the penumbra and a
number of transient regions with a CEF at photospheric heights
(see Rempel 2015) will provide us with additional tools to deter-
mine the dominant forces driving the ﬂows. An important advan-
tage of this is that we will be able to study the dynamics of the
ﬂows at constant geometrical heights and to look into the vertical
gradients at sub-photospheric depths, which are not accessible to
observations.

Finally, studying in detail the history of the sunspot and the
associated chromospheric activity can help us understand the
formation process of the anomalous penumbra, the initiation of
the CEF and its change of direction into a NEF. This will be the
topic of a future study.
