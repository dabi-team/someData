Abstract.
Planetary nebulae are the products of the evolution of low and interme-
diate mass stars. The chemical property studies of these objects give
important information about the elemental abundances as He, O, Ne, Ar,
S and their modiﬁcations associated with the evolution of the progenitor
stars. The determination of accurate abundances in planetary nebulae is
important from the perspective of the stellar evolution as well as the for-
mation and chemical evolution of galaxies. Recently, new HeI emissivities
and ionization correction factors (ICFs) were published in the literature.
In this work, these new parameters are used in a code for the determina-
tion of chemical abundances in photoionized nebulae. This code is used
for the recompilation of the chemical abundances of planetary nebulae
from the Galactic bulge observed previously by our group and also for
the determination of new chemical abundances of a sample of planetary
nebulae located near the Galactic centre. The new emissivities and ICFs
slightly modiﬁed the elemental abundances of He, N, O, Ar and Ne. On
the other hand, S abundances are higher than previous determinations.
The new ICFs can contribute to solve partially the sulphur anomaly.

Introduction

The determination of accurate chemical abundances in planetary nebulae (PNe)
is very important, since these objects can contribute to studies regarding stellar
evolution as well as the chemical evolution of galaxies. Recently, new He i emis-
sivities have become available in the literature through the work of Porter et al.
(2012) and subsequently corrected by Porter et al. (2013), hereafter PFSD13.
These are the most recent He i emissivities, and collisional eﬀects are already
included in the emissivities calculation. In this work the emissivities of PFSD13
are adopted in order to calculate the He i abundances and provide accurate He i
abundances. Usually, the spectral range of the observations is not suﬃcient to
observe all the necessary lines of a given ion, and it is not possible to calcu-

late the total abundance of a particular element by the direct sum of the ionic
abundances of all the ions present in a nebula. Instead, it must be calculated
by means of the ionization correction factors (ICFs). One of most frequently
used ICFs in the literature are those from Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994), here-
after KB94. However, recently Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014), hereafter DMS14,
have published new ICFs formulae based on a grid of photoionization models
and they have computed analytical expressions for the ICFs of He, O, N, Ne, S,
Ar, Cl and C. These new ICFs incorporate more recent physics and are derived
using a wider range of parameters of photoionization models than the previous
ICFs from KB94. Another advantage of the new ICFs provided by DMS14 is the
possibility to compute the errors in the elemental abundances introduced by the
adopted ICF approximation. They provide analytical formulae to estimate error
bars associated with the ICFs, something not possible until their work. Accord-
ing to DMS14, the oxygen abundances are not expected to be very diﬀerent from
those calculated with the ICFs of KB94. On the other hand, the abundances of
N, S, Ar, Ne calculated with the new ICFs show signiﬁcant diﬀerences. However,
a direct comparison between the abundances of N, S, Ar and Ne calculated with
both ICFs is missing in DMS14. The aim of this work is to use these ICFs and
new emissivities to derive chemical abundances of a PNe sample located in the
Galactic bulge and also near the Galactic centre (GC).

2. The sample and abundance determinations

The new emissivities and ICFs were used to recalculate the elemental abundances
of PNe located in the Galactic bulge from Cavichia et al.
(2010), hereafter
CCM10. We followed the same procedures described in CCM10, nonetheless
using the new emissivities from PFSD13 and ICFs from DMS14. The H+ emis-
sivities are from Aver et al. (2010) and He ii emissivities are from Osterbrock
& Ferland (2006). Also, In 2009 we started an observational program aimed at
carrying out a spectroscopic follow-up of high-extinction GBPNe located within
2 degrees of the GC from the catalogue of Jacoby & Van de Steene (2004). The
Goodman spectrograph at the 4.1 m SOAR telescope at Cerro Pachón (Chile)
was used to perform spectroscopic follow-up of 33 objects located within 2 degrees
of the GC, in a region of a very high-level of reddening. From those objects, 15
had spectra with acceptable quality to derive physical parameters and chemical
abundances. The optical spectra of the GBPNe near the GC suﬀer for high-level
of extinction caused by the material near the Galactic plane and also in the
central regions of the Galaxy. As a result, important diagnostic lines as [O iii]
λ4363 Å and [N ii] λ5755 Å do not have enough S/N ratio to obtain the elec-
tron temperature from the temperature diagnostic diagrams. Other important
temperature-sensitive lines are those from S+3. In order to observe the NIR [S iii]
lines, we started an observational program in 2012 at the Observatório Pico dos
Dias (OPD) of National Laboratory for Astrophysics (LNA, Brazil) with the 1.6
m Perkin-Elmer telescope and a Cassegrain Boller & Chivens spectrograph was
used. The details of the observations, data reduction, abundances determinations
and results can be seen in Cavichia et al. (2017), hereafter C17.

3. Results

The abundances derived using the new He i emissivities from PFSD13 are com-
pared in Fig. 1 (left panel) with those from Pequignot et al. (1991) hereafter
PPB91. The PNe sample used for the comparison is that one from CCM10. As
can be seen, some small diﬀerences arise when using the new emissivities. From
now on, the emissivities from PFSD13 will be used to analyze the diﬀerences
in the ICFs. A direct comparison between the ICFs from DMS14 and KB94 is
provided for N in Fig. 1 (right panel). Most of the abundances are compatible,
however for a few objects the N abundance is higher than the one obtained by
using the previous ICF. This is regarded as the new ICFs formulae use a wider
range of parameters of photoionization models than the previous ICFs .

Figure 1.
Left: Comparison between He/H abundances from CCM10
(outer bulge PNe) calculated using the emissivities from Porter et al.
(2013, PFSD13) and Pequignot et al. (1991, PPB91). Error bars in-
clude only the errors in the ICFs. The red continuous line is the one to
one relation. Right: The same as left panel but for log(N/H) + 12.

In Fig. 2 the same confrontation is done for O, Ar, S, and Ne. Small diﬀerences
are noted for O, Ar and Ne for both ICFs. However, In the case of S the new
ICFs provide higher abundances than the previous ones from KB94. The new
ICFs from DMS14 can, at least partially, solve the “sulphur anomaly problem”
in PNe.
The behaviour of Ar/H vs. O/H and S/H vs. O/H are presented Fig. 3. In
this ﬁgure both samples from CCM10 (outer bulge PNe) and C17 (PNe near the
GC) are included. A correlation is found for these elemental abundances for both
samples, although S/H vs. O/H for CCM10 data the correlation is not as tight
as in the case of our data. S abundances of C17 were determined using both
S+ and S++ ions, contributing to reduce the uncertainties in the S abundances.
The predictions of evolution models by Karakas (2010) at Z = 0.004, 0.008 and
0.02 are displayed in the graph for S/H vs. O/H. Clearly, models show that S is
not modiﬁed by stellar nucleosynthesis, independently of the initial stellar mass.
On the contrary, O is expected to be modiﬁed in progenitor stars heavier than
4 M⊙ at low-metallicity environments. In the case of Ar, the models by Karakas
(2010) do not give predictions for these elements, so that the abundances could
not be compared with theoretical results.

from C17 (PNe near the GC), while ﬁlled blue triangles are the data
from CCM10 (outer bulge PNe). The symbols with numbers represent
the results of the models from Karakas (2010) for a given value of Z:
red stars joined by dotted line for Z = 0.004; yellow triangles joined by
dashed line for Z = 0.008; purple circles joined by dash-dotted line for
Z = 0.02. The numbers give the initial masses of the individual models
in M⊙ units. The red continuous lines are straight lines with slopes
equal to one.

Fig. 4 shows the N/O ratio as a function of O abundances. We can observe a
fair agreement between the data and the models by Karakas (2010) for models

Z = 0.008 and 0.02. An important diﬀerence between the samples of C17 and
CCM10 is observed in this ﬁgure:
in CCM10 some points are compatible with
the lower metallicity model (Z = 0.004) by Karakas (2010) and also lower initial
masses (< 4M⊙).
In the sample of C17 (PNe near the GC) the majority of
PNe have abundances compatible with models at higher metallicities. This can
indicate a faster chemical enrichment taking place at the GC, compared with the
outer regions of the Galactic bulge. However, this result should be interpreted
with some caution, since due to the high interstellar extinction in the direction
of the GC it is very diﬃcult to deﬁne a metallicity-unbiased sample.

4. Conclusions

We have implemented the new ICFs from Delgado-Inglada (2014, DMS14) for
the elemental abundances determination and also the new He i emissivities from
Porter et al. (2013, PFSD13). The abundances of Cavichia et al. (2010, CCM10)
were recalculated with the new emissivities and ICFs. A direct comparison be-
tween the He abundances using the new He i emissivities and those from Pe-
quignot et al. (1991, PPB91) resulted in small diﬀerences. The new ICFs from
DMS14 were compared with those from Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994, KB94).
The results show that N, O, Ar and Ne abundances are compatible within the
uncertainties. However, S abundances derived with the new ICFs are higher by
0.2 dex in average. The new ICFs from DMS14 can, at least partially, solve the
“sulphur anomaly problem” in PNe.
We have performed spectrophotometric observations with the 4.1 m SOAR (Chile)
and the 1.6 m OPD/LNA (Brazil) telescopes to obtain physical parameters and
chemical abundances for a sample of 15 planetary nebulae located within 2 de-
grees of the galactic centre (see details in Cavichia et al. 2017). S abundances
were derived using optical and NIR lines, reducing the uncertainties associated
with S ICFs. The abundances predicted by Karakas (2010) for stars of diﬀer-
ent initial masses and metallicities were used to constrain the masses and initial

metallicity of the progenitor stars. An important diﬀerence between the sample
located near the Galactic centre and PNe located in the outer parts of the bulge
is observed.
In our previous work (CCM10) some points are compatible with
the lower metallicity model (Z = 0.004) by Karakas (2010) and also lower initial
masses (< 4M⊙).
In the PNe located near the Galactic centre, the majority
of PNe have abundances compatible with models at higher metallicities. This
can indicate a faster chemical enrichment taking place at the Galactic centre,
compared with the outer regions of the Galactic bulge.
