Abstract

The anti-Ramsey number Ar(G, H) is the maximum number of colors in an
edge-coloring of G with no rainbow copy of H. In this paper, we determine the
exact anti-Ramsey number in the generalized Petersen graph Pn,k for cycles Cd,
where 1 ≤ k ≤ (cid:98) n−1
2 (cid:99) and 5 ≤ d ≤ 6. We also give an algorithm to obtain the
upper bound or lower bound of anti-Ramsey number.

Introduction

Let G = (V (G), E(G)) be a graph. We denote by E(v) the set of all edges incident
with v in G, and by Cd a cycle of order d. Let M (G) be the maximum number of
vertex-disjoint cycles with length at least 2 in G.

An edge-coloring of a graph G is a mapping φ : E(G) → {1, 2, . . . , c}, where
{1, 2, . . . , c} is a set of colors. An edge colored graph is called rainbow if all the colors
on the edges are distinct. A rainbow copy of a graph H in an edge-colored graph G is a
subgraph of G isomorphic to H such that the coloring restricted to H is rainbow. Given

two graphs G and H, the anti-Ramsey number Ar(G, H) is the maximum number of
colors in an edge-coloring of G which has no rainbow copy of H. If there is no copy of
H in G, then Ar(G, H) = |E(G)|.

The study of anti-Ramsey theory was initiated by Erd¨os, Simonovits and S´os in
1973 [4] and considered in the classical case when G = Kn. They presented a close
relationship between the anti-Ramsey number and Tur´an number. Since then, plentiful
results were researched for a variety of graphs H, including cycles [1, 2, 12, 13, 18, 19],
cliques [4, 17], trees [9, 11], and matchings [7, 16]. Some other graphs were also con-
sidered as the host graphs in anti-Ramsey problems, such as hypergraphs [6], hy-
pecubes [3], complete split graphs [5, 14], and triangulations [8, 10, 15].

For cycles, Erd¨os, Simonovits and S´os [4] showed that Ar(Kn, C3) = n − 1. Alon [1]
showed that Ar(Kn, C4) = (cid:98) 4n
3 (cid:99) − 1. Montellano-Ballesteros and Neumann-Lara [18]
proved that Ar(Kn, Cd) = ( d−2
2 + 1
d−1)n+O(1) for 3 ≤ d ≤ n. In 2015, Horˇn´ak, Jendrol,
Schiermeyer and Sot´ak [8] investigated the anti-Ramsey numbers for cycles in plane
triangulations. Lan, Shi and Song [15] gave the upper and lower bounds of the anti-
Ramsey number Ar(Wn, Cd) for n ≥ d − 1 and d ≥ 6. Recently, Xu, Lu and Liu [19]
completely solved the anti-Ramsey numbers of cycles in wheel graphs and determined
some exact values of Ar(G, Cd) when the host graph G is Pm × Pn, Pm × Cn, Cm × Cn
and cyclic Cayley graph, respectively.

Here, we are interested in the anti-Ramsey problems in generalized Petersen graphs
for cycles. Let n ≥ 3 and k be integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. The generalized
Petersen graph Pn,k is a graph of order 2n with V (Pn,k) = {ui, vi : 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}
and edge set E(Pn,k) = {uiui+1, uivi, vivi+k : 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}, where subscripts are
taken modulo n. Let On = {u0, u1, . . . , un−1} and In = {v0, v1, . . . , vn−1}. Then
V (Pn,k) = On ∪ In. The subgraph induced by On is called the outer rim, while the
subgraph induced by In is called the inner rim. A spoke of Pn,k is an edge of the form
uivi for some 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Note that Pn,k is isomorphic to Pn,n−k. Hence we can
always assume that 1 ≤ k ≤ (cid:98) n−1

2 (cid:99).

The generalized Petersen graph has been extensively investigated as many nice

structural and algorithmic properties.

Proposition 1.1 (i) Pn,k contains C5 if and only if n ∈ {3, 5} or k ∈ {2, n

5 , 2n

5 , n−1

2 };

(ii) Pn,k contains C6 if and only if k ∈ {1, 3, n

6 , n−1

3 , n+1

3 , n−2

2 }.

Proof. Note that V (Pn,k) = On ∪ In. By the deﬁnition of Pn,k, |V (C5) ∩ On| ∈
{0, 2, 3, 5} and |V (C6) ∩ On| ∈ {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}. Obviously, Pn,1 contains C5 for n ∈ {3, 5}
and C6 for n ≥ 3. So, in the following, we can assume k ≥ 2.

2

Let Ct = w1w2 · · · wtw1 be a cycle of length t in Pn,k. If V (Ct) ⊆ On, then t = n.
If |V (Ct) ∩ On| = 0, i.e., V (Ct) ⊆ In, then we can assume w1 = v0 by symmetry, and
then Ct = v0vkv2k · · · v(t−1)kv0, which implies tk ≡ 0 (mod n) and ik (cid:54)≡ 0 (mod n) for
1 ≤ i ≤ t − 1. Combining this with 1 ≤ k ≤ (cid:98) n−1
5 } for t = 5
and k = n
6 for t = 6. Thus we may assume 2 ≤ |V (Ct) ∩ On| ≤ t − 1. Without loss of
generality, we assume w1 = u0 and w2 = u1.

2 (cid:99), we have k ∈ { n

5 , 2n

(i) Note that |V (C5) ∩ On| ∈ {2, 3}. If |V (C5) ∩ On| = 2, then |V (C5) ∩ In| = 3,
w5 = v0 and w3 = v1. Let w4 = vs, then v1vs, vsv0 ∈ E(Pn,k), which implies s − 1 = k
and n − s = k. So k = n−1
2 .

If |V (C5) ∩ On| = 3, that is |V (C5) ∩ In| = 2, then we can assume that w3 = u2,

and w4 = v2, w5 = v0, which implies v2v0 ∈ E(Pn,k). Thus k = 2.

(ii) Note that |V (C6)∩On| ∈ {2, 3, 4} and NIn(vi) = {vi+k, vn−k+i} for 0 ≤ i ≤ n−1.
If |V (C6) ∩ On| = 2, then w3 = v1, w6 = v0, w4 = vk+1 (resp. w4 = vn−k+1)
and w5 = v2k+1 (resp. w5 = vn−2k+1), which implies 3k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod n) (resp.
n − 3k + 1 ≡ 0 (mod n)), i.e., k = n−1
3

(resp. k = n+1

3 ).

If |V (C6) ∩ On| = 3, say w3 = u2, then w4 = v2, and w5 = vk+2 (resp. w5 = vn−k+2),

which implies 2k + 2 ≡ 0 (mod n) (resp. n − 2k + 2 ≡ 0 (mod n)), i.e., k = n−2
2 .

If |V (C6) ∩ On| = 4, then we can assume that w3 = u2 and w4 = u3. Thus w5 = v3,

which implies k = 3 as w6 = v0.

In this paper, we determine the exact anti-Ramsey number in Pn,k for Cd, where

1 ≤ k ≤ (cid:98) n−1

2 (cid:99) and 5 ≤ d ≤ 6. Our results are as follows.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give some notations
and lemmas which will be used in the proof of main results. The exact values of
Ar(Pn,k, C5) and Ar(Pn,k, C6) for 1 ≤ k ≤ (cid:98) n−1

respectively.

2 Preliminaries

A hypergraph is a pair H = (V, F ), where V is a ﬁnite set of vertices and F is a
family of subsets of V such that for every F ∈ F , F (cid:54)= ∅ and V = (cid:83)
If
F ∈F F .
|F | = 1, we call F a loop. The rank of H is deﬁned as r(H) = maxF ∈F |F |.
If
r(H) = 2, then H is a graph. For every v ∈ V , denote FH(v) = {F ∈ F |v ∈ F }. Let
s(H) = max{|Fi ∩ Fj| : Fi, Fj ∈ F }.

Let G be a simple graph with E(G) = {e1, e2, . . . , em}, and let Ψ = {G1, . . . , Gl}
with E(G) = ∪l
i=1E(Gi), where Gi is a subgraph of G for 1 ≤ i ≤ l. A hypergraph HG,Ψ
is constructed in [19] with V (HG,Ψ) = {x1, x2, . . . , xl} and E(HG,Ψ) = {F1, F2, . . . , Fm},
where each xi corresponds to Gi in Ψ (1 ≤ i ≤ l) and xi ∈ Fj if and only if ej ∈ E(Gi)
(1 ≤ j ≤ m).

Given a graph G and Ψ = {G1, . . . , Gl}, where Gi is a subgraph of G for 1 ≤ i ≤ l.
For an edge-coloring of G, H ∈ Ψ is called rainbow-Ψ graph if the coloring restricted to
H is rainbow. Let ArG(Ψ) denote the maximum number of colors in a coloring of the
edges of G such that there is no rainbow-Ψ graph of G. Obviously, if Ψ = {G1, . . . , Gl}
is the set of all copies of H in G, then Ar(G, H) = ArG(Ψ).

The following two lemmas will be useful in the proof of our main results.

Lemma 2.1 [19] Let G = (V, E) be a simple graph. Let Ψ = {G1, . . . , Gl} such that
E(G) = ∪l
i=1E(Gi), where Gi is a subgraph of G for 1 ≤ i ≤ l. Suppose HG,Ψ is a
graph. Then

ArG(Ψ) = |E(G)| − |Ψ| + M (HG,Ψ).

Lemma 2.2 [19] Let G = (V, E) be a simple graph. Let Ψ = {G1, . . . , Gl} such that
E(G) = ∪l
i=1E(Gi), where Gi is a subgraph of G for 1 ≤ i ≤ l. Suppose HG,Ψ is a
hypergraph with r(HG,Ψ) = r and s(HG,Ψ) = s, then

ArG(Ψ) ≤ |E(G)| −

(cid:24) 2l

r + s

(cid:25)

.

Let H = (V, F ) be a hypergraph with |V (H)| = l and F = {F1, F2, . . . , Fm}.
Given an integer h with 0 ≤ h ≤ m − 1. Let {F1, F2, . . . , Fm−h} be an (m − h)-
partition of F with |F1| ≥ |F2| ≥ · · · ≥ |Fm−h| ≥ 1. For 1 ≤ i ≤ m − h, we
denote Li := {v ∈ Ft ∩ Fj | Ft, Fj ∈ Fi, t (cid:54)= j} if |Fi| ≥ 2, and ∅ otherwise. Then
|Li| is the number of vertices which appear simultaneously in at least two edges in Fi
when |Fi| ≥ 2. If each vertex contained in the edges of Fi appears simultaneously
in only two edges of Fi, then Fi is called a barrier. Obviously, | (cid:83)m−h
If
| (cid:83)m−h
i=1 Li| < l for any (m − h)-partition of F , then we say H ∈ Ph,l and call that H
satisﬁes the property Ph,l. Clearly, if H /∈ Ph,l, then there exists a (m − h)-partition
{F1, F2, . . . , Fm−h} of E(H) such that | (cid:83)m−h

i=1 Li| = l, that is, (cid:83)m−h

i=1 Li| ≤ l.

i=1 Li = V .

Note that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ m − h,

|Li| ≤

if |Fi| ≥ 3
if |Fi| = 2
otherwise.

(1)

Hence, if |Fi| ≥ 3 and r(H) is even, then the equality in (1) holds if and only if Fi is
a barrier.

Lemma 2.3 Let H = (V, F ) be a hypergraph with |V (H)| ≥ 7 and F = {F1, F2, . . . , Fm}
with m ≥ 4. If r(H) = 3 and s(H) = 2, then H ∈ P3,7.

5

Proof. Let {F1, F2, . . . , Fm−3} be an (m − 3)-partition of F with |F1| ≥ |F2| ≥
· · · ≥ |Fm−3| ≥ 1. Then 2 ≤ |F1| ≤ 4 and (cid:80)m−3
i=1 (|Fi| − 1) = 3. Since r(H) = 3
and s(H) = 2, we have |Li| ≤ 2(|Fi| − 1) for 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 3 by (1). So | (cid:83)m−h
i=1 Li| ≤
(cid:80)m−3
i=1 (|Fi| − 1) = 6 < 7, and hence H ∈ P3,7.

i=1 |Li| ≤ 2 (cid:80)m−3
Let G = (V, E) be a (hyper)graph. Let φ be an edge-coloring of G with the color set
K = {c1, c2, . . . , ct}. Note that coloring here need not be proper. Suppose φ−1(ci) (cid:54)= ∅
for each ci ∈ K. Let E(ci) = {e ∈ E(G) | φ(e) = ci} and D(ci) = |E(ci)|−1 for ci ∈ K.
Set D(G) = (cid:80)
ci∈K D(ci). Then D(ci) is the repeated number of the color ci and D(G)
is the repeated number of all colors in G. Obviously, |K| = |E(G)| − D(G). In the
following, we will give a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the bounds of ArG(Ψ).

Lemma 2.4 Let G = (V, E) be a simple graph with |E(G)| = m. Let Ψ = {G1, . . . , Gl}
such that E(G) = ∪l
i=1E(Gi), where Gi is a subgraph of G for 1 ≤ i ≤ l. Suppose h is an
integer with 0 ≤ h ≤ m−1. Then HG,Ψ ∈ Ph,l if and only if ArG(Ψ) ≤ |E(G)|−(h+1).

Proof. Suppose that E(G) = {e1, . . . , em}, V (HG,Ψ) = {x1, . . . , xl} and E(HG,Ψ) =
{F1, F2, . . . , Fm}, where each xi corresponds to Gi in Ψ for 1 ≤ i ≤ l and each Fj
corresponds to ej for 1 ≤ j ≤ m.

Let φ be an edge-coloring of G with the color set K = {c1, c2, . . . , cm−h} such that
φ−1(ci) (cid:54)= ∅. Consider the edge-coloring φ∗ of HG,Ψ: φ∗(Fj) = φ(ej) for 1 ≤ j ≤ m.
Then Dφ(G) = Dφ∗(HG,Ψ) = h. Denote Fi = {F ∈ E(HG,Ψ) | φ∗(F ) = ci}, 1 ≤ i ≤
m − h. Then {F1, F2, . . . , Fm−h} is a (m − h)-partition of E(HG,Ψ).

If HG,Ψ ∈ Ph,l, then | (cid:83)m−h

i=1 Li| < l, and thus (cid:83)m−h

i=1 Li ⊂ V (HG,Ψ). Let xp ∈
V (HG,Ψ) \ ((cid:83)m−h
i=1 Li). Then each edge of FHG,Ψ(xp) is colored with distinct colors in
HG,Ψ, and then every edge of E(Gp) is colored with distinct colors in G. It follows that
there exists a rainbow Gp in any edge-coloring of G by using m − h = |E(G)| − Dφ(G)
colors. So ArG(Ψ) ≤ (|E(G)| − Dφ(G)) − 1 = |E(G)| − (h + 1).

Conversely, we suppose that HG,Ψ /∈ Ph,l. Then there exists a (m − h)-partition
1, F (cid:48)
i = V (HG,Ψ). Let φ(cid:48) be an edge-

m−h} of E(HG,Ψ) such that (cid:83)m−h

2, . . . , F (cid:48)

i=1 L(cid:48)

{F (cid:48)
coloring of HG,Ψ such that φ(cid:48)−1(ci) = F (cid:48)

i for 1 ≤ i ≤ m − h. Then Dφ(cid:48)(HG,Ψ) = h.

Now we give an edge-coloring φ(cid:48)(cid:48) of G as follows: φ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ej) = φ(cid:48)(Fj), where each Fj
corresponds to ej (1 ≤ j ≤ m). Then Dφ(cid:48)(cid:48)(G) = Dφ(cid:48)(HG,Ψ) = h. Note that, for any
xp ∈ V (HG,Ψ), xp ∈ L(cid:48)
i for some i (1 ≤ i ≤ m − h), and hence there are at least two
edges of FHG,Ψ(xp) colored with the same color in HG,Ψ, which implies at least two
edges in each Gp are colored with the same color. So, G contains no rainbow-Ψ graph
of G. Therefore, ArG(Ψ) ≥ |E(G)| − Dφ(cid:48)(cid:48)(G) = |E(G)| − h.

In order to obtain the bounds of ArG(Ψ), we need to check that whether a hyper-
graph HG,Ψ satisﬁes the property Ph,l or not by Lemma 2.4. So we give the following
algorithm.

3 Anti-Ramsey number Ar(Pn,k, C5)

In this section, we will determine the anti-Ramsey number Ar(Pn,k, C5) for 1 ≤ i ≤
(cid:98) n−1
2 (cid:99). If G contains no C5, then Ar(Pn,k, C5) = |E(Pn,k)| = 3n. Thus by Proposition
1.1(i), we can assume that n ∈ {3, 5} or k ∈ {2, n

5 , 2n

5 , n−1

2 }.

Lemma 3.1 Ar(P3,1, C5) = 7.

i , G2

i := uiui+1vi+1vi+2ui+2ui, G2

Proof. Let G1
Ψ = {G1

i := uiui+1vi+1vi+2viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2. Then
i | 0 ≤ i ≤ 2} is the set of all C5 in P3,1, and then Ar(P3,1, C5) = ArP3,1(Ψ).
First we show that Ar(P3,1, C5) ≥ 7. Let φ : E(P3,1) → {1, 2, . . . , 7} be an edge-
coloring of P3,1 such that φ(uivi) = 1 for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2 and every other edges obtains
distinct colorings from {2, . . . , 7} (see Fig. 1(a)). Note that each C5 ∈ Ψ contains two
spokes uivi and ui+1vi+1 for some 0 ≤ i ≤ 2, and hence P3,1 has no rainbow C5 under
the coloring φ. So, Ar(P3,1, C5) ≥ 7.

Next we show that Ar(P3,1, C5) ≤ 7. Let V (HP3,1,Ψ) = {xi, yi | 0 ≤ i ≤ 2} and
E(HP3,1,Ψ) = {F0, . . . , F8}, where xi and yi correspond to G1
i in Ψ, respectively,
each Fi corresponds to uiui+1, Fi+3 corresponds to uivi, and Fi+6 corresponds to vivi+1
for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2. Note that uiui+1 is contained in G1
i , uivi is contained in
G1
i+2 for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2. Thus
Fi = {xi, xi+1, yi}, Fi+3 = {xi+1, xi+2, yi, yi+2}, Fi+6 = {xi+2, yi+1, yi+2} for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2,
and so r(HP3,1,Ψ) = 4 and s(HP3,1,Ψ) = 2. By Lemma 2.2, we have Ar(P3,1, C5) =
ArP3,1(Ψ) ≤ |E(P3,1)| − (cid:100) 2|Ψ|

Lemma 3.2 Ar(P5,1, C5) = 13.

8

Proof. Let P (cid:48)
5,1 = P5,1 − E(cid:48), where E(cid:48) = {uivi | 0 ≤ i ≤ 4}, and let G1 :=
u0u1u2u3u4u0, G2 := v0v1v2v3v4v0. Then Ψ(cid:48) = {G1, G2} is the set of all copies of
C5 in P (cid:48)
(Ψ(cid:48)). Note that each edge in E(Gi) is only
5,1, and then Ar(P (cid:48)
5,1, C5) = ArP (cid:48)
5,1,Ψ(cid:48) is a graph obtained from two isolated vertices by adding
contained in Gi. Thus HP (cid:48)
5,1,Ψ(cid:48)) = 0. By Lemma 2.1, we have
ﬁve loops on each isolated vertex, and so M (HP (cid:48)
Ar(P (cid:48)
5,1,Ψ(cid:48)) = 8. Since there is no copy
of C5 in P5,1 containing any edge of E(cid:48), Ar(P5,1, C5) = |E(cid:48)| + Ar(P (cid:48)

Lemma 3.3 Ar(P5,2, C5) = 10.

i := uiui+1vi+1vi+3viui, G2
Proof. Let G1
G3 := u0u1u2u3u4, G4 := v0v2v4v1v3v0. Then Ψ = {G1
set of all copies of C5 in P5,2. Hence Ar(P5,2, C5) = ArP5,2(Ψ).

i := uiui+1ui+2vi+2viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ 4, and let
i , G3, G4 | 0 ≤ i ≤ 4} is the

First we show that Ar(P5,2, C5) ≥ 10. Let φ : E(P5,2) → {1, 2, . . . , 10} be an

edge-coloring of P5,2 deﬁned as follows:

φ(e) =

if e ∈ E(u0) \ {u0v0};
if e ∈ E(v2);
if e ∈ E(v3),

and every other edges obtains distinct colorings from {4, . . . , 10} (see Fig. 1(b)). Note
that each C5 ∈ Ψ contains the edges {u0u1, u0u4}, or two edges of E(vi) (i ∈ {2, 3}),
and so P5,2 has no rainbow C5. Hence, Ar(P5,2, C5) ≥ 10.

Next we show that Ar(P5,2, C5) ≤ 10. Let V (HP5,2,Ψ) = {xi, yi, z, w | 0 ≤ i ≤ 4}
and E(HP5,2,Ψ) = {F0, . . . , F14}, where xi, yi, z and w correspond to G1
i , G3
and G4 in Ψ, respectively, each Fi corresponds to uiui+1, Fi+5 corresponds to uivi,
and Fi+10 corresponds to vivi+2 for 0 ≤ i ≤ 4. Note that each uiui+1 is contained
in G1
i , G1
i+3,
and each vivi+2 is contained in G1
i and G4. Thus Fi = {xi, yi, yi+4, z},
Fi+5 = {xi, xi+4, yi, yi+3} and Fi+10 = {xi+2, xi+4, yi, w} for 0 ≤ i ≤ 4. It follows that
r(HP5,2,Ψ) = 4 and s(HP5,2,Ψ) = 2.

Now we will show that HP5,2,Ψ ∈ P4,12. Suppose that HP5,2,Ψ /∈ P4,12. Then there
i=1 Li| = 12. Assume
i=1(|Fi| − 1) = 4. If |F2| ≤ 2,
i=1(|Fi| − 1) + 2 =

exists a 11-partition {F1, F2, . . . , F11} of E(HP5,2,Ψ) with | (cid:83)11
that |F1| ≥ · · · ≥ |F11| ≥ 1. Then 2 ≤ |F1| ≤ 5 and (cid:80)11
then by (1), | (cid:83)11
i=1 |Li| ≤ 2|F1| + (cid:80)11
10 < 12, a contradiction. So |F2| ≥ 3, and then |F1| = |F2| = 3. By (1),

i=2 2(|Fi| − 1) = 2 (cid:80)11

which implies |Li| = 2|Fi| = 6 for i = 1, 2, L1∪L2 = V (HP5,2,Ψ) and L1∩L2 = ∅. Hence,
each Fi (i ∈ {1, 2}) is a barrier. Without loss of generality, we assume F0 ∈ F1. Then
x0, y0, y4, z ∈ L1, and then {F10, F11, F13, F14} ∩ F2 = ∅ as y0 ∈ F10, x0 ∈ F11 ∩ F13, y4 ∈
F14. Note that F (w) = {Fi | 10 ≤ i ≤ 14}, and so w /∈ L2 as |F2| = 3. Then
w ∈ L1, and then |F1| ≥ 4, a contradiction. Therefore, HP5,2,Ψ ∈ P4,12. By Lemma
2.4, Ar(P5,2, C5) = ArP5,2(Ψ) ≤ |E(P5,2)| − (4 + 1) = 10.

Lemma 3.4 Ar(P10,2, C5) = 22.

Proof. Let G1
v1v3v5v7v9v1. Then Ψ = {G1
and then Ar(P10,2, C5) = ArP10,2(Ψ).

i := uiui+1ui+2vi+2viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ 9, and let G2 := v0v2v4v6v8v0, G3 :=
i , G2, G3 | 0 ≤ i ≤ 9} is the set of all copies of C5 in P10,2,

Note that each edge uiui+1 is contained in G1

i and G2 for i ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}; each

edge vivi+2 is contained in G1
i and G3 for i ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Thus HP10,2,Ψ is a simple
graph of order 12 (see Fig. 2). Since there exist four vertex-disjoint cycles w0w1w2w0,
w3w4w5w3, w6w8w11w6 and w7w9w10w7 in HP10,2,Ψ, M (HP10,2,Ψ) = 4. By Lemma 2.1,
Ar(P10,2, C5) = ArP10,2(Ψ) = |E(P10,2)| − |Ψ| + M (HP10,2,Ψ) = 22.

Proof. Let Gi := uiui+1ui+2vi+2viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Then Ψ = {Gi | 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}
is the set of all copies of C5 in Pn,2, and then Ar(Pn,2, C5) = ArPn,2(Ψ). Note that
each edge uiui+1 is contained in Gi and Gi+n−1; uivi is contained in Gi and Gi+n−2;
vivi+2 is contained in Gi for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Thus HPn,2,Ψ is a graph obtained from

Let Gi := uiui+1vi+1vi+ n+1

viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Then Ψ = {Gi | 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} is
the set of all copies of C5 in Pn,k, and then Ar(Pn,k, C5) = ArPn,k(Ψ). Note that each
uiui+1 is contained in Gi, uivi is contained in Gi and Gi+n−1, vivi+ n−1

Gi+ n−1

wi+n−1 for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Then
by adding a loop on wi and an edge wi+ n−1
wj is a 3-cycle in HPn,k,Ψ for 0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1. Let C be the set of

4 Anti-Ramsey number Ar(Pn,k, C6)

In this section, we will determine the anti-Ramsey number Ar(Pn,k, C6). If G contains
no C6, then Ar(Pn,k, C6) = |E(Pn,k)| = 3n. Thus by Proposition 1.1(ii), it is only neces-
sary to consider the anti-Ramsey number Ar(Pn,k, C6) when k ∈ {1, 3, n

Moreover, if k = 2, then n ∈ {5, 6, 7, 12}.

4.1 k = 1

In this subsection, we focus on the case that k = 1. Then n ≥ 3.

Lemma 4.1 Ar(P3,1, C6) = 7.

Proof. Let Gi := uiui+1ui+2vi+2vi+1viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2. Then Ψ = {G0, G1, G2} is the
set of all copies of C6 in P3,1, and then Ar(P3,1, C6) = ArP3,1(Ψ). Note that each uiui+1
is contained in Gi and Gi+2, uivi is contained in Gi and Gi+1, and vivi+1 is contained in
Gi and Gi+2 for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2. Thus HP3,1,Ψ is a graph obtained from the 3-cycle w0w1w2w0
by adding two parallel edges on each edge of C3. Then M (HP3,1,Ψ) = 1. By Lemma
2.1, Ar(P3,1, C6) = ArP3,1(Ψ) = |E(P3,1)| − |Ψ| + M (HP3,1,Ψ) = 7.

Lemma 4.2 Ar(P4,1, C6) = 9.

i := uiui+1vi+1vi+2vi+3viui, G2

Proof. Let G1
i := uiui+1ui+2ui+3vi+3viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3. Then Ψ = {Gj
ui+2vi+2vi+3viui and G4
i ≤ 3, 1 ≤ j ≤ 4} is the set of all C6 in P4,1, and then Ar(P4,1, C6) = ArP4,1(Ψ).

Let φ : E(P4,1) → {1, 2, . . . , 9} be an edge-coloring of P4,1 such that φ(uivi) = 1
for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3 and every other edges having distinct colorings from {2, . . . , 9} (see
Fig. 3(a)). Note that each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two spokes, and hence P4,1 has no rainbow
C6 under the coloring φ. So, Ar(P4,1, C6) ≥ 9.

i , G3

Now we will show that Ar(P4,1, C6) ≥ 9. Let V (HP4,1,Ψ) = {xi, yi, zi, wi | 0 ≤ i ≤ 3}
and E(HP4,1,Ψ) = {F0, . . . , F11}, where xi, yi, zi, wi correspond to G1

for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, and thus r(HP4,1,Ψ) = 8. Obviously, s(HP4,1,Ψ) = 4. By Lemma 2.2, we
have Ar(P4,1, C6) = ArP4,1(Ψ) ≤ |E(P4,1)| − (cid:100) 2|Ψ|

Lemma 4.3 Ar(P6,1, C6) = 14.

Proof. Let G1
G3 := v0v1v2v3v4v5v6v0. Then Ψ = {G1
C6 in P6,1, and Ar(P6,1, C6) = ArP6,1(Ψ).

i := uiui+1ui+2vi+2vi+1viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ 5, G2 := u0u1u2u3u4u5u6u0 and
i , G2, G3 | 0 ≤ i ≤ 5} is the set of all copies of

if e ∈ E(v3),

and every other edges obtains distinct colorings from {3, . . . , 14} (see Fig. 3(b)). Note
that each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two edges of E(u0) (or E(v3)), and so P6,1 has no rainbow
C6. Hence, Ar(P6,1, C6) ≥ 14.

On the other hand, let V (HP6,1,Ψ) = {xi, y, z | 0 ≤ i ≤ 5} and E(HP6,1,Ψ) =
i , G2 and G3 in Ψ, respectively,
{F0, . . . , F17}, where xi, y and z correspond to G1
each Fi corresponds to uiui+1, Fi+6 corresponds to uivi and each Fi+12 corresponds
to vivi+1 for 0 ≤ i ≤ 5. Note that each uiui+1 is contained in G1
i+5 and G2,
i , G1
uivi is contained in G1
i , G1
i+5 and G3 for
0 ≤ i ≤ 5. It follows that Fi = {xi, xi+5, y}, Fi+6 = {xi, xi+4} and Fi+12 = {xi, xi+5, z}
for 0 ≤ i ≤ 5, and then r(HP6,1,Ψ) = 3 and s(HP6,1,Ψ) = 2. By Lemma 2.2, we have

Lemma 4.4 Ar(Pn,1, C6) = (cid:98) 5n

2 (cid:99) for n ≥ 5 and n (cid:54)= 6.

13

Proof. Since n ≥ 5 and n (cid:54)= 6, Ψ = {Gi | 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} is the set of all copies of C6
in Pn,1, where Gi := uiui+1ui+2vi+2vi+1viui. Note that each uiui+1 is contained in Gi
and Gi+n−1, uivi is contained in Gi and Gi+n−2, vivi+1 is contained in Gi and Gi+n−1
for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Thus HPn,1,Ψ is a graph obtained from Cn = w0w1 · · · wn−1w0 by
adding one parallel edge on each edge of Cn and edge wiwi+2 for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Then
M (HPn,1,Ψ) = (cid:98) n

By Lemmas 4.1-4.4, the proof of Theorem 1.3 is completed.

In this subsection, we focus on the case that k = 2. Then n ≥ 5. By Proposition
1.1(ii), we have n ∈ {5, 6, 7, 12}.

Fig. 4 P5,2 and P6,2 have no rainbow C6 under the coloring φ.

Lemma 4.5 Ar(P5,2, C6) = 11.

Proof. Let G1
Then Ψ = {G1

i = uiui+1vi+1vi+4vi+2viui, G2
i , G2

i | 0 ≤ i ≤ 4} is the set of all copies of C6 in P5,2.

i = uiui+1ui+2ui+3vi+3viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ 4.

Let φ : E(P5,2) → {1, 2, . . . , 11} be an edge-coloring of P5,2 such that φ(uivi) = 1
for 0 ≤ i ≤ 4 and every other edges obtains distinct colorings from {2, . . . , 11} (see
Fig. 4(a)). Note that each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two spokes, and so P5,2 has no rainbow C6.
Hence, Ar(P5,2, C6) ≥ 11.

Next we will show that Ar(P5,2, C6) ≤ 11. Let V (HP5,2,Ψ) = {xi, yi | 0 ≤ i ≤ 4} and
i in Ψ, respectively,

E(HP5,2,Ψ) = {F0, . . . , F14}, where xi and yi correspond to G1

Fi+10 = {xi, xi+1, xi+3, yi+2} for 0 ≤ i ≤ 4, and thus r(HP5,2,Ψ) = 4 and s(HP5,2,Ψ) = 2.

Then Ψ = {G1

i := uiui+1vi+1vi+3vi+5ui+5ui for 0 ≤ i ≤ 5, and G2 := u0u1u2u3u4u5u0.
i , G2 | 0 ≤ i ≤ 5} is the set of all C6 in P6,2, and Ar(P6,2, C6) = ArP6,2(Ψ).

Let φ : E(P6,2) → {1, 2, . . . , 14} be an edge-coloring of P6,2 deﬁned as follows:

(cid:40)

φ(e) =

and every other edges obtains distinct colorings from {3, . . . , 14} (see Fig. 4(b)). Note
that each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two edges of E(ui) (i ∈ {0, 3}), and so P6,2 has no rainbow
C6. Hence, Ar(P6,2, C6) ≥ 14.

Next we will show that Ar(P6,2, C6) ≤ 14. Let V (HP6,2,Ψ) = {xi, y | 0 ≤ i ≤ 5} and
i and G2 in Ψ, respectively,
E(HP6,2,Ψ) = {F0, . . . , F17}, where xi and y correspond to G1
each Fi corresponds to uiui+1, Fi+6 corresponds to uivi, and Fi+12 corresponds to vivi+2
for 0 ≤ i ≤ 5. Note that each edge uiui+1 is contained in Gi, Gi+1 and G2, uivi is
contained in Gi+1 and Gi+5, vivi+2 is contained in Gi+3 and Gi+5 for 0 ≤ i ≤ 5. Hence
Fi = {xi, xi+1, y}, Fi+6 = {xi+1, xi+5} and Fi+12 = {xi+3, xi+5} for 0 ≤ i ≤ 5, and thus
r(HP6,2,Ψ) = 3 and s(HP6,2,Ψ) = 2. By Lemma 2.3, HP6,2,Ψ ∈ P3,7, and then by Lemma
2.4, we have Ar(P6,2, C6) = ArP6,2(Ψ) ≤ |E(P6,2)| − (3 + 1) = 14.

Lemma 4.7 Ar(P7,2, C6) = 17.

Proof. Let Gi := uiui+1vi+1vi+3vi+5viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ 6. Then Ψ = {Gi | 0 ≤ i ≤ 6} is
the set of all copies of C6 in P7,2, and then Ar(P7,2, C6) = ArP7,2(Ψ).

Let φ : E(P7,2) → {1, 2, . . . , 17} be an edge-coloring of P7,2 deﬁned as follows:

(cid:40)

φ(e) =

1,

if e ∈ E(v3);
if e ∈ E(v4),

and every other edges obtains distinct colorings from {3, . . . , 17} (see Fig. 5(a)). Note
that each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two edges of E(vi) (i ∈ {3, 4}), and so P7,2 has no rainbow
C6. Hence, Ar(P7,2, C6) ≥ 17.

15

Next we will show that Ar(P7,2, C6) ≤ 17. Let V (HP7,2,Ψ) = {xi | 0 ≤ i ≤ 6} and
E(HP7,2,Ψ) = {F0, . . . , F20}, where xi corresponds to Gi in Ψ, each Fi corresponds to
uiui+1, Fi+7 corresponds to uivi and Fi+14 corresponds to vivi+2 for 0 ≤ i ≤ 6. Note
that each uiui+1 is contained in Gi, uivi is contained in Gi and Gi+6, vivi+2 is contained

Fi+12 = {xi+2, xi+4, xi+6} for 0 ≤ i ≤ 6, and thus r(HP7,2,Ψ) = 3 and s(HP7,2,Ψ) = 2.
By Lemma 2.3, HP7,2,Ψ ∈ P3,7, and then by Lemma 2.4, Ar(P7,2, C6) = ArP7,2(Ψ) ≤

and |F5| = 1. Moreover, {L1, L2, . . . , L18} is a partition of V (HP8,3,Ψ), F1, F2 are
barriers. Note that Q contains no K4 and K5, and hence |F1| = |F2| = 3, |F3| =
|F4| = 2 and |F5| = 1. By symmetry, we can assume F1 = {F 1

L1 = {x0, x5, x6, x7, y0, y1, y7, z0, z7}, and then F2 = {F 1

L2 = {x1, x2, x3, x4, y3, y4, y5, z3, z4} and L3 ∪ L4 = {y2, y6, z1, z2, z5, z6}. On the other

Thus |F3| ≥ 3, and so |F1| = |F2| = |F3| = 3 and |F4| = 1. Then by (1), |Li| ≤ 9
for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3. If Qi is not a K3 for some 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, then we can check that |Li| ≤ 6. So
we can assume |L1| = |L2| = 9, and then Q1, Q2 are K3. If Q3 is not a K3, then |L3| = 6
and Fi are barriers as |L1 ∪ L2 ∪ L3| = 24 for i = 1, 2, 3, and thus by an argument
similar to the above, we can have a contradiction. Therefore Q3 = K3 and |L3| = 9.
If Li ∩ Lj = ∅ for some 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3, then by an argument similar to the above, we
can have a contradiction. So Li ∩ Lj (cid:54)= ∅ for any 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3. Assume that F1 =

as L1 ∩ Li = ∅ for i = 2, 3. Furthermore, we can check that |Li ∩ L1| = 3 for i = 2, 3.
Note that Q is 4-regular, and hence there exists some x ∈ (L1 ∩ L2) \ (L1 ∩ L3). Thus
| (cid:83)18
i=1 Li| ≤ 9 + 9 + 9 − 3 − 1 = 23 < 24, a contradiction. Therefore, HP8,3,Ψ ∈ P6,24.

and every other edges obtains distinct colorings from {6, . . . , 22} (see Fig. 7). Note that
each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two edges of E(vi) (0 ≤ i ≤ 2) or two edges of E(uj)\{ujvj} (j ∈

if e ∈ {u2iu2i+1, u2i+1u2i+2}, 0 ≤ i ≤ 8;
if e ∈ {vj+3vj, vjvj−3}, 0 ≤ j ≤ 2;

and every other edges obtains distinct colorings from {13, . . . , 42} (see Fig. 9). Note
that each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two edges u2iu2i+1, u2i+1u2i+2 for some 0 ≤ i ≤ 8, or two
edges vj+3vj, vjvj−3 for some 0 ≤ j ≤ 2, and hence P18,3 has no rainbow C6 under the

Next, we will show that Ar(P18,3, C6) ≤ 42. Let V (HP18,3,Ψ) = {xi, yj | 0 ≤ i ≤

Now we will show that HP18,3,Ψ ∈ P11,21. Suppose that HP18,3,Ψ /∈ P11,21. Then
there exists a 43-partition {F1, F2, . . . , F43} of E(HP18,3,Ψ) with | (cid:83)43

then (cid:83)43

So (cid:80)43
i=1(|Fi| − 1) − 2 = 20 < 21, a contradiction. Therefore, HP18,3,Ψ ∈

Lemma 4.12 Ar(Pn,3, C6) = (cid:98) 5n

2 (cid:99) for n ≥ 7 and n /∈ {8, 10, 18}.

Proof. Let Gi := uiui+1ui+2ui+3vi+3viui for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Then Ψ = {Gi | 0 ≤ i ≤
n − 1} is the set of all copies of C6 in Pn,3, and then Ar(Pn,3, C6) = ArPn,3(Ψ).

Let φ : E(Pn,3) → {1, 2, . . . , (cid:98) 5n

if e = u0un−1 and n ≡ 1

(mod 2),

2 (cid:99) − 1;

21

and every other edges obtains distinct colorings from {(cid:98) n
2 (cid:99)}. Note that
if n ≡ 0 (mod 2), then each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two edges u2iu2i+1, u2i+1u2i+2 for some
0 ≤ i ≤ (cid:98) n
2 (cid:99) − 1; and if n ≡ 1 (mod 2), then each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two edges
u2iu2i+1, u2i+1u2i+2 for some 0 ≤ i ≤ (cid:98) n
2 (cid:99) − 2 or two of {un−3un−2, un−2un−1, u0un−1},
and hence Pn,3 has no rainbow C6 under the coloring φ. So, Ar(Pn,3, C6) ≥ (cid:98) 5n

2 (cid:99) + 1, . . . , (cid:98) 5n

2 (cid:99).

Next, we will show that Ar(Pn,3, C6) ≤ (cid:98) 5n

2 (cid:99). Note that each edge uiui+1 is con-
tained in Gi, Gi+n−2 and Gi+n−1, uivi is contained in Gi and Gi+n−3, vivi+3 is con-
tained in Gi for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Then V (HPn,3,Ψ) = {xi | 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} and
E(HPn,3,Ψ) = {F0, . . . , F3n−1} with Fi = {xi, xi+n−2, xi+n−1}, Fi+n = {xi, xi+n−3} and
Fi+2n = {xi} for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Thus r(HPn,3,Ψ) = 3 and s(HPn,3,Ψ) = 1. By Lemma

Proof. Let

Gi :=

uivivi+kvi+2kvi+1ui+1ui,

if k = n−1
3 ;
if k = n+1
3 ,

Then Ψ = {Gi | 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} is the set of all copies of C6 in Pn,k for k ∈ { n−1
Then Ar(Pn,k, C6) = ArPn,k(Ψ). Recall that |E(Pn,k)| = 3n.

If n ≡ 1 (mod 2), then let φ : E(Pn,k) → {1, 2, . . . , (cid:98) 5n

of Pn,k such that φ(v0vk) = φ(vkv2k) = φ(v2kv3k) = 1, φ(vikv(i+1)k) = (cid:100) i

(Fig. 10(a) illustrates the coloring φ of P13,4). Then each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two edges of
{v0vk, vkv2k, v2kv3k} or two edges v(2i+1)kv(2i+2)k, v(2i+2)kv(2i+3)k for some 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1

and hence Pn,k has no rainbow C6 under the coloring φ.

If n ≡ 0 (mod 2), then let φ : E(Pn,k) → {1, 2, . . . , (cid:98) 5n

2 (cid:99)} be an edge-coloring of
Pn,k such that φ(vikv(i+1)k) = (cid:98) i
2(cid:99) + 1 for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and every other edges
2 + 1, . . . , (cid:98) 5n
obtains distinct colorings from { n
2 (cid:99)} (Fig. 10(b) illustrates the coloring
φ of P16,5). Note that each C6 ∈ Ψ contains two edges v2ikv(2i+1)k, v(2i+1)kv(2i+2)k for
some 0 ≤ i ≤ n
2 − 1, and hence Pn,k has no rainbow C6 under the coloring φ. So,
Ar(Pn,k, C6) ≥ (cid:98) 5n
2 (cid:99) for n ≡ 0 (mod 2). So, in either case, Ar(Pn,k, C6) ≥ (cid:98) 5n

2 (cid:99).

Now, we show that Ar(Pn,k, C6) ≤ (cid:98) 5n

2 (cid:99). Let V (HPn,k,Ψ) = {xi | 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}
and E(HPn,k,Ψ) = {F0, . . . , F3n−1}, where each xi corresponds to Gi in Ψ, each Fi
corresponds to uiui+1, Fi+n corresponds to uivi, Fi+2n corresponds to vivi+k for k ∈
{ n−1
3 }. Note that for 0 ≤ i ≤ n−1, each uiui+1 is contained in Gi, uivi is contained
, Gi+n−1 when k = n−1

in Gi, Gi+n−1, vivi+ n−1
3 . It follows that Fi = {xi},

Fi+n = {xi, xi+n−1} and

Obviously, r(HPn,k,Ψ) = 3 and s(HPn,k,Ψ) = 1, then by Lemma 2.2, Ar(Pn,k, C6) =
ArPn,k(Ψ) ≤ |E(Pn,k)| − (cid:100) 2|Ψ|
2 (cid:101) = (cid:98) 5n

Proof. Let Gi := uiui+1vi+1vi+ n
vi+n−1ui+n−1ui for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Then Ψ = {Gi | 0 ≤
i ≤ n − 1} is the set of all copies of C6 in Pn,k, and Ar(Pn,k, C6) = ArPn,k(Ψ). Note
that each edge uiui+1 is contained in Gi and Gi+1; each spoke uivi is contained in
Gi+1 and Gi+n−1; each edge vivi+ n−2
and Gi+n−1 for 0 ≤ i ≤
n − 1. Thus HPn,k,Ψ is a graph obtained from a cycle w0w1 · · · wn−1w0 by adding edges
3 (cid:99) vertex-disjoint
wi+1wi+n−1 and wi+ n
cycles w3iw3i+1w3i+2w3i in HPn,k,Ψ for 0 ≤ i ≤ (cid:98) n
3 (cid:99). By
Lemma 2.1, Ar(Pn,k, C6) = ArPn,k(Ψ) = |E(Pn,k)| − |Ψ| + M (HPn,k,Ψ) = (cid:98) 7n

wi+n−1 for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Since there exist (cid:98) n

3 (cid:99) − 1, we have M (HPn,k,Ψ) = (cid:98) n

is contained in Gi+ n

By Lemmas 4.13-4.15, we complete the proof of Theorem 1.6.
