(Dated: 4 November 2016)

We have developed a novel two-layer anti-reﬂection (AR) coating method for large-diameter infrared (IR)
ﬁlters made of alumina, for the use at cryogenic temperatures in millimeter wave measurements. Thermally-
sprayed mullite and polyimide foam (Skybond Foam) are used as the AR material. An advantage of the
Skybond Foam is that the index of refraction is chosen between 1.1 and 1.7 by changing the ﬁlling factor.
Combination with mullite is suitable for wide-band millimeter wave measurements with suﬃcient IR cutoﬀ
capability. We present the material properties, fabrication of a large-diameter IR ﬁlter made of alumina with
this AR coating method, and characterizations at cryogenic temperatures. This technology can be applied
to a low-temperature receiver system with a large-diameter focal plane for next-generation cosmic microwave
background (CMB) polarization measurements, such as POLARBEAR-2 (PB-2).

INTRODUCTION

As astronomical and cosmological observations always
demand higher sensitivities,
importance of large focal
planes with detectors at cryogenic temperatures ever in-
creases. The observation of the cosmic microwave back-
ground (CMB) polarization, which is one of the best
probes for studying the early universe1,2, is an outstand-
ing example where such cryogenic large detector arrays
are needed. Recently, a few CMB polarization experi-
ments have reported the detection of the faint sub-degree-
scale B-mode signal, the odd-parity mode of the CMB po-
larization pattern2. The use of a large array with an order
of 10,000 polarization detectors, such as the focal plane
of POLARBEAR-2 (PB-2)3, SPT-3G4, and BICEP-35, is
essential for characterizing the B-mode power spectrum.
The need of a large focal plane leads to a challenge
in the thermal design, as large thermal load is expected
from a large optical window.6 In order to keep the detec-
tor sensivitity high enough, eﬃcient infra-red (IR) ﬁlters
should be considered. One promising solution to this
problem is to introduce an alumina plate as an IR ﬁl-
ter with high thermal conductivity3–5,7,8. The alumina

a)iyuki@post.kek.jp

ﬁlter absorbs the incident IR emission eﬃciently. The
absorbed power is conducted from the central region of
the ﬁlter to the edge, which is thermally connected to
the cryogenic stage. The thermal conductance of alu-
mina in the temperature range between 50 and 100 K is
very high; three orders of magnitude as large as those
of conventional plastic ﬁlters, such as PTFE, nylon, and
black polyethylene. The temperature gradient and op-
tical loading of the alumina plate are thus very small
even with a large diameter, which is ideal as the IR ﬁlter
material.

A remaining technological challenge on the use of alu-
mina IR ﬁlter is to establish AR coatings for a large
frequency coverage. Alumina is known to be highly re-
ﬂective in the millimeter wavelength. We thus need an
AR coating on each surface of the alumina disc. AR
coating on such a large surface is easily peeled oﬀ ow-
ing to the thermal shock at cold temperatures. The
aforementioned next-generation CMB projects demand
multi-layer AR coatings on large IR ﬁlters with a typical
diameter of 500 mm. In the previous studies, the PO-
LARBEAR group attempted to develop a two-layer AR
coating method with epoxy on an alumina surface, with a
diameter of 50 mm7–9. However, the epoxy and alumina
cracked during thermal cycling. To avoid the cracking,
stress-relief grooves were adopted to reduce the stress
between alumina and the epoxy layer.7 This technology

 
 
 
 
 
 
was also used in the BICEP-35 group, which succeeded
in making an single-layer AR coating with epoxy for a
diameter of about 500 mm. However, this method is ex-
pensive. Also, it is not easy to maintain the thickness
uniformity of the AR layers on the thin alumina plate.
Alternatively, the ACTpol10 group succeeded in making
two- and three-layer AR coatings on silicon lenses, whose
diameters were approximately 300 mm. They tried and
succeeded using the technology of subwavelength grating
(SWG). It is theoretically possible to apply this technol-
ogy to an alumina surface; however, it is diﬃcult because
the dicing blade is subject to wear so that groove pitch
and depth are changed.
It is also diﬃcult to make a
large ingot of silicon. Machining the material is also very
expensive. Yet another method studied for the SPIDER
project is a polyimide sheet as an AR coating on the sap-
phire with a diameter of about 250 mm11. The SPIDER
method is very easy to perform and less expensive than
the method with epoxy or SWG.

Finally, the ﬁrst application of thermal sprayed mullite
as AR coating was made on a 50 mm diameter alumina
disc 12. It is also possible to tune the dielectric constant
of a thermal sprayed layer by spraying microspheres and
alumina powder with diﬀerent ratios. A three-layer ther-
mal sprayed broadband AR coating that achieves over a
100 % fractional bandwidth has been demonstrated on a
50 mm diameter alumina disc13..

In this study, we newly employ the polyimide foam
coating on the mullite coating described above to estab-
lish a two-layer AR coating method. We apply this tech-
nique to a thin and large alumina disc with a 460 mm di-
ameter as an IR ﬁlter, and demonstrate the performance
of the AR coating.

We fabricated a 2 mm thick and 460 mm diameter
alumina ﬁlter, and demonstrated the performance of the
new AR coating. Our development focuses on the use
in future CMB measurements but the method developed
can also be used for other applications. In Section II we
describe the design of a large-diameter alumina IR ﬁlter
with our new AR coating method. Section III explains
our measurements of material properties. The fabrica-
tion process is detailed in Section IV. Section V shows our
characterization of the AR coatings on a large-diameter
alumina IR ﬁlter. We discuss our results in Section VI
and give conclusions in Section VII.

II. DESIGN

To be concrete, our AR-coating deveopment targets
next-generation CMB experiments, where typical re-
quirements on the IR ﬁlter and the AR coating are as
follows:14

• The ﬁlter diameter must be extendable to 450 mm

or larger;

• The AR coating is robust against thermal shock, so

that it is usable in cryogenic temperatures;

2

• The uniformity of the additional optical path
length due to the AR coating should be less than
λ/50, where λ is the wavelength of the incoming
electromagnetic wave;

• Transmittance should be above 95 % at the detec-
tion bands, which we assume 95 GHz and 150 GHz
with a 30 % fractional bandwidth for each;

• The 3 dB cutoﬀ frequency should be below 1 THz.
The ﬁlter diameter requirement satisﬁes the requirement
for a large focal plane with O(10000) superconducting
millimeter-wave sensors. The requirement on robustness
against thermal shock is important for use at low tem-
peratures. The thickness of the AR coating is designed to
be λ/4 so that the reﬂected beam is canceled. The uni-
formity must be better than λ/50, which corresponds to
a transmittance uncertainty of 1 %. The requirement on
transmittance in detection bands comes from the design
sensitivity of experiment. The requirement on the cut-
oﬀ frequency is derived to reduce the IR emission whose
main frequency range is 10-100 THz.

Figure 1 shows a schematic view of two-layer AR coat-
ings on a large-diameter alumina disc. The design satis-
ﬁes the typical requirements mentioned above. The AR
coatings consist of the thermally-sprayed mullite, which
has the index of refraction (IOR) of 2.5 as the ﬁrst layer
and polyimide foam (called Skybond Foam15 hereafter)
as the second layer. A thin layer of low-density polyethy-
lene (LDPE) is placed in between two AR layers as a glue
layer. We employ the mullite as the ﬁrst layer because
the coeﬃcient of thermal expansion (CTE) is close to
that of alumina. The idea of using the Skybond Foam for
the second layer is a natural extension of the polyimide
sheet adopted by SPIDER, which was explained in the
previous section. An important advantage of the poly-
imide foam is that the IOR can be controlled by chang-
ing the ﬁlling factor of the polyimide, which gives us an
additional tuning knob to optimize the AR coating prop-
erties for given observation frequencies. Our example
design for this study is optimized to achieve the high-
est integrated eﬃciency for simultaneous measurements
centered at 95 GHz and 150 GHz with a 30 % fractional
bandwidth for each. Here we ﬁx the thickness of the
alumina and the IOR of mullite, while the IOR of the
Skybond Foam and the thicknesses of mullite and the
Skybond Foam layers are free parameters. For the de-
sign in Fig. 1, the optimized IOR for the Skybond Foam
is 1.43. Measurements of the properties of each AR layer
as well as those of alumina we have used in this study
are described in the next section.

III. MATERIAL PROPERTIES

We have measured basic properties of alumina, mul-
lite and the Skybond Foam. The measurements include
thicknesses, IORs, and the loss tangent values. Table I
summarizes our results.

3

A. Alumina

The sintered polycrystalline alumina was manufac-
tured by Nihon Ceratech corporation with a purity of
99.5 % (labeled as 99.5LD)18. The loss tangent of the
99.5 % purity of the alumina is low in the detection band
and high in the sub-millimeter wavelength. The large
gradient of the loss tangent between the detection band
and the sub-millimeter region results in a sharp IR cutoﬀ.
We have also tested alumina with purities of 99.9 % and
99.99 % from the same company and have concluded that
99.5LD is the best material. More details are described
elsewhere8.

B. Mullite

Mullite is a high-performance ceramic stable at atmo-
spheric pressure. We place the mullite on both alumina
surfaces using the thermal-spraying method developed by
Tocalo corporation12,19 We measure the transmittance of
the mullite at 298 K and 81 K. The measured frequencies
are between 72 and 148 GHz. This measurement yields
fringe patterns from the interferogram of the alumina and
mullite layers. Mullite has asperity structure, with a sur-
face roughness Ra and a ten-point average roughness Rz
of 6 µm (6 µm) and 36 µm (34 µm) at one (the other)
side, respectively. We apply the eﬀective medium theory
(EMT)20 to the surface of mullite to obtain the eﬀective
IORs as follows;

where neﬀ , nm, and n0 are the eﬀective IOR, IOR of
mullite and vacuum, respectively, and (1 − f ) is the ﬁll-
ing factor, deﬁned as 1 − Ra/Rz. We can approximate
the asperity surface as the virtual layer from the EMT
as illustrated in Fig. 2. The estimated IORs and loss
tangents in Table. I are obtained using the EMT.

C. Skybond Foam

The Skybond Foam is an polyimide foam, which is
manufactured by the IST corporation15. Figure 3 shows
photomicrographs of the Skybond Foam with a ﬁlling fac-
tor of 10 % and 60 %. The ﬁlling factor is deﬁned as the
volume-ﬁlling fraction of the polyimide in the mixture,
which can be controlled from 10 % to 100 %. Each cell
of the Skybond Foam has a size of ∼ 10 µm.
In gen-
eral, the IORs and loss of the material depend on the
ﬁlling factor21. We measure the IOR and loss tangent
of Skybond Foam with diﬀerent ﬁlling factors between
10 and 100 % (10, 20, 30, 50, 60, and 100 %). The
size of each sample is 100 mm × 100 mm with a thick-
ness of 10 mm. The thick Skybond Foam was chosen to
perform measurements with high signal-to-noise ratios.

FIG. 1. A schematic view of the two-layer AR coatings on
a large-diameter alumina disc. The AR coatings consist of
the thermally-sprayed mullite as the ﬁrst layer and polyimide
foam (Skybond Foam) as the second layer. A thin layer of
low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is placed in between two
AR layers as a glue layer.

TABLE I. Basic properties of alumina and AR materials.
The thickness d, the IOR n, and the loss tangent tan δ are
listed. Our measurements for n and tan δ are carried out
both at room temperature and at the temperature of liquid
nitrogen, whereas the thickness values are only measured at
room temperature. The errors include both statistical and
systematic uncertainties. The systematic errors mainly arise
from the uncertainty of the AR thicknesses and temperature
variations during the measurements.

The IOR and the loss tangent are obtained from trans-
mission measurements. A detailed description of the
measurement system is available elsewhere7. The beam
at millimeter wavelength (72-108 GHz and 108-148 GHz)
is produced by a signal generator with a sixfold and eight-
fold frequency multiplier16. The frequency range of the
signal generator is between 12 and 18 GHz. The beam is
collimated by an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethy-
lene lens and the measured sample is placed immediately
after the aperture. The transmitted radiation is detected
by a diode detector. The signal is chopped at 13 Hz for
modulation with a lock-in ampliﬁer, and the modulated
signal is obtained using a DAQ. The detector is moved
along the optical axis for more than a half wavelength
to subtract the eﬀect of a standing wave in the measure-
ment setup. We measure the power with and without
the sample and take the ratio between them to obtain
the transmittance. The measured transmittance is ﬁtted
with the Fresnel formula17. In the following sections, we
describe more details on each material.

FIG. 2. The schematic view of the mullite surface and the
model with the eﬀective medium theory (EMT). The mullite
has an asperity surface, which we can approximate as the vir-
tual layer based on the EMT. The eﬀective IOR of the virtual
layer is described by Equation (1). This equation depends on
the ﬁlling factor which is given by the ratio between Ra and
Rz.

FIG. 4. The IORs (top) and loss tangents (bottom) as a func-
tion of ﬁlling factor. The sample is placed at 298 K or 81 K.
The error bars in the y axis correspond to systematic error
of millimeter source ﬂuctuation. The size of the measured
samples are 100 mm × 100 mm × 10 mm.

ﬁlling factor. The bubbles are pressed with a 10 ton weight.
The average diameter of the unit cells is 10 µm. Right: Mea-
sured sample of Skybond Foam with a 60 % ﬁlling factor.

The measured IOR and loss tangent at 298K and 81 K
are shown in Fig. 4. The black curve is the best ﬁt for
the 81 K measurement, where the EMT with Eq. (1) is
used. The estimated IORs are n0 = 1.049 ± 0.005 and
nm = 1.748±0.006. We decide to use a ﬁlling factor of 60
% for the AR material because it gives the IOR closest
to the target value of 1.43.

IV. FABRICATION

Figure 5 shows a photo of the fabricated alumina IR ﬁl-
ter with the AR coating with mullite and Skybond Foam.
We use an alumina disc with a diameter of 460 mm and a
thickness of 2 mm. We place the mullite layer with ther-

mal spraying on both sides of the alumina. The thick-
ness of the mullite is (0.24 ± 0.02) mm as already listed
in Table I. We place a sheet of low-density polyethy-
lene (LDPE) with a thickness of 30 µm as the bond
layer. This layer is sandwiched by the Skybond Foam
and mullite surface. The thickness of the Skybond Foam
is (0.39 ± 0.02) mm as already listed in Table I. The
surface of Skybond Foam is then shaped with a milling

machine, whose diameter and rotating speed of the blade
are 4 mm and 6000 rpm, respectively. The uniformity of
the thickness is improved by a factor of two through the
machining process. The stack of Skybond Foam, mul-
lite and alumina layers are then baked in an oven. We
sandwich the stacked layer with 10 mm thick aluminum
boards and press them using lead blocks with a pressure
of 3, 000 N/m2. We adopt the baking recipe established
by the SPIDER group11. We start the baking cycle by
slowly ramping up the temperature from room temper-
ature to the baking temperature of 160 ◦C over 6 hours
to avoid thermal shock. After keeping the baking tem-
perature for 6 hours, we spend another 6 hours to ramp
down to room temperature.

V. CHARACTERIZATION

We perform a series of measurements to verify that the
fabricated large-diameter sample satisﬁes each require-
ment listed in Section II. First of all, we run a thermal
cycle test from 300 K to 77 K with conductive cooling.
The AR coating passes the thermal cycle test over ten
times. No damage such as cracks due to thermal con-
traction is found.

To check the uniformity, we select 9 positions shown
in Fig. 6 and measure the IOR and loss tangent at
room temperature for a frequency range between 72 and
108 GHz. The instrument described in Section III is used
for the measurements. The results are shown in Fig. 7.
We then measure the thickness uniformity of the Sky-
bond Foam and mullite using a coordinate measuring
machine (CMM). The results are shown in Fig. 8. We
calculate the optical path length in both Skybond Foam
and mullite with the measured IOR and thickness. These
ﬂuctuations are less than λ/50 as shown in Table II.

We measure the transmittance of the alumina ﬁlter
with the same setup described in Section III at room tem-
perature and at 81 K cooled with liquid nitrogen. Since
the uniformity measurements at room temperature gu-
rantee that the fabrication process is independent of the
size of the ﬁlter, to perform measurements with liquid ni-
trogen, we fabricated a sample with 50 mm in diameter
to avoid mechanical conﬂict with the measurement sys-
tem. Figure 9 shows the result. The black lines show ﬁt
results with the EMT. The estimated average transmit-
tances are 95.9 % and 95.8 % in the 95 GHz and 150 GHz

FIG. 10. The transmittance of the IR ﬁlter at the THz band.
The red crosses represent measurements at 298 K and the
blue open circles are for 19 K.

The transmittance of the alumina ﬁlter at sub-
millimeter wavelengths is measured using a Fourier trans-
form spectrometer (FTS) with an InSb bolometer. A
mercury lamp is used as a broadband thermal source.
The detailed description of the FTS is found else-
where22. The transmittance is measured from 200 GHz
to 1,500 GHz at two diﬀerent temperatures of 19 K and
298 K. We prepare the alumina ﬁlters with a diameter of
20 mm for the FTS measurements.

The measured spectrum at 19 K has a higher transmit-
tance than the spectrum at 298 K as shown in Fig. 10.
The 3 dB cutoﬀ frequencies of the ﬁlter are estimated as
400 and 650 GHz at 295 and 19 K, respectively. These
3 dB cut oﬀ frequencies are suﬃciently lower than our
design goal.

bands, respectively. We estimate the emissivity, ǫ, from
the following equation:

ǫ = A = 1 − R(d, n, tan δ, ν) − T (d, n, tan δ, ν),

(2)

where A, R and T are the absorption, the power re-
ﬂectance, and the transmittance of the ﬁlter, respectively.
The reﬂectances calculated from the parameters given in
Table I are 2.1 % and 1.1 % at 95 GHz and 150 GHz
bands. The estimated emissivities are 2.7 % and 4.2 %
in the 95 GHz and 150 GHz bands, respectively.

We have demonstrated that the AR coating method
with mullite and Skybond Foam satisﬁes all the require-
ments listed in Section II, which are typical in next-
generation CMB experiments. Although we have focused
on the measurements at 95 GHz and 150 GHz, a fu-
ture CMB satellite mission LiteBIRD23–25 for example
requires wider frequency ranges from 40 GHz to 400 GHz
using two telescopes. Skybond Foam is tunable in IOR
and can thus be considered as a candidate technology for
such a space mission. We have newly applied the EMT in
millimeter wave measurements to have the better surface
model, which were not adopted in previous works. The
ﬁt results are in better agreement with data. The perfor-
mances of the new AR coating method described in this
study are as good as those with epoxy with grooves. The
fabrication time of the method with mullite and Skybond
Foam is much shorter than the epoxy coating, which is a
clear advantage. Finally, this method can in principle be
applied to curved surfaces, so that applications for lenses

 
should also be considered.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have newly introduced polyimide foam (Skybond
Foam) as the AR coating material. We show that the
IOR of Skybond Foam is controlled between 1.1 and
1.7 by changing the ﬁlling factor. The tunable IOR al-
lows us to design a multi-layer AR coating much easier.
We have made a two-layer AR coating with thermally-
sprayed mullite as the ﬁrst layer and Skybond Foam as
the second layer on a 2 mm-thick alumina plate with 460
mm in diameter. We have conﬁrmed that sample uni-
formity in the IOR and thickness is satisfactory for 150
GHz measurements. We have also conﬁrmed that the
AR coating is robust against thermal cycles. The mea-
sured transmittances of this ﬁlter at 81 K are 95.8 % for
95 GHz and 95.9 % for 150 GHz. The measured 3 dB
cut-oﬀ frequency is 650 GHz at 19 K. The results satisfy
requirements on IR ﬁlters for next-generation CMB po-
larization measurements where a large focal-plane and a
large window are needed.
