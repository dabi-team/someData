A Statistical Learning Approach to

Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication

Abstract

Mission-critical applications require Ultra-Reliable Low Latency (URLLC) wireless connections,
where the packet error rate (PER) goes down to 10−9. Fulﬁllment of the bold reliability ﬁgures

becomes meaningful only if it can be related to a statistical model in which the URLLC system

operates. However, this model is generally not known and needs to be learned by sampling the wireless

environment. In this paper we treat this fundamental problem in the simplest possible communication-

theoretic setting: selecting a transmission rate over a dynamic wireless channel in order to guarantee

high transmission reliability. We introduce a novel statistical framework for design and assessment of

URLLC systems, consisting of three key components: (i) channel model selection; (ii) learning the

model using training; (3) selecting the transmission rate to satisfy the required reliability. As it is

insufﬁcient to specify the URLLC requirements only through PER, two types of statistical constraints

are introduced, Averaged Reliability (AR) and Probably Correct Reliability (PCR). The analysis and the

evaluations show that adequate model selection and learning are indispensable for designing consistent

physical layer that asymptotically behaves as if the channel was known perfectly, while maintaining the

reliability requirements in URLLC systems.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) is among the most exciting novelties in

5G networks [1]–[3]. The projected reliability guarantees of 10−5, and even going down to

10−9, represent the ultra-reliable (UR) regime of wireless operation. This regime is necessary to

support a multitude of mission-critical applications, such as remote control of robots, autonomous

coordination among vehicles as well as many yet-to-be-deﬁned use cases. The strictness of the

reliability requirements increases the focus on the performance of the physical layer, its main

design assumptions [1], [4], the modeling of the inherently unreliable wireless channel [5], [6]

and the adequacy of existing transmission strategies in UR-relevant regime [6].

Fulﬁllment of the bold ﬁgures on reliability for URLLC becomes meaningful only if it can

be related to a statistical model in which the URLLC system operates, as in that case one can

calculate the probability of error or failure. However, the statistical model and the probability

distribution of the parameters that affect the occurrence of errors are, generally, unknown and

the URLLC system needs to invest resources to learn them. In general, the statistical model

can encompass the interference from other devices, behavior of the protocols, etc. Here we

consider the simplest possible communication-theoretic setting: selecting a transmission rate over

a dynamic wireless channel, in absence of interference, in order to guarantee high transmission

reliability. For example, even if it is known that a channel is subject to a Rayleigh fading,

guaranteeing certain reliability means that the average gain of that channel is known perfectly.

In this paper we address two fundamental questions:

1) What level of knowledge is required about the wireless channel to be able to guarantee ultra-

reliable support of a certain transmission rate? To the best of our knowledge, the existing

URLLC studies select the transmission parameters by ignoring the uncertainty introduced

by the transmission environment. As a result, the assumption of perfect knowledge of

the channel statistics needs to be revised, as without it, the extreme reliability guarantees

become questionable. This assumption is fundamentally unreliable, and although it might

be acceptable in existing wireless systems with reliability targets in the order of 10−3,

the impact of channel uncertainty will lead to severe performance degradation in URLLC

systems.

2) How to pose the requirements for ultra-reliability in a statistically correct way? Stating only

that we need a packet error rate of e.g. ǫ = 10−6 is insufﬁcient. We deﬁne two different

way to measure reliability: Averaged Reliability (AR), suitable for dynamically changing

environments, and Probably Correct Reliability (PCR), where we assign a conﬁdence that

the reliability target will be met in a relatively static environment.

We take a closer look into the impact that the channel uncertainty has on the reliability that can

be attained in wireless systems operating in UR-relevant regime. This calls naturally for the use

of the statistical learning methodology, which has recently started to get a traction in the wireless

communication community [7]. Our investigation, which to the best of our knowledge is the ﬁrst

of its kind, shows that, the knowledge about the true channel statistics affects signiﬁcantly the

amount of effort that has to be invested in guaranteeing high reliability. Furthermore, compared

to the case in which the channel statistics is perfectly known, the transmitter needs to sacriﬁce

the spectral efﬁciency in order to meet the reliability requirements. Hence, more robust methods

for design and assessment of URLLC systems are required. We illustrate this in the following

example.

A. A Motivating Example

Alice is selling an ultra-reliable wireless communication system. In the advertisement she

claims that the system can deliver information at a rate of up to R with the probability of failing

being no larger than ǫ (e.g. 10−5). Bob considers purchasing the system and wants the following

two questions answered:

1) How does Alice measure the reliability performance?

2) Under what conditions can the system offer the advertised performance?

To investigate, Bob contacts Alice and gets the following response: when established over a ﬂat

fading wireless channel with received power drawn from a cumulative distribution function F ,

the system can support one-way transmission at a maximal rate R = Rǫ(F ) while maintaining

link outage probability equal to ǫ. Alice also provides Bob a list of rates Rǫ(F ) for various

values of F and ǫ.

Alice’s answer might sound reassuring to some customers, but not to Bob. Instead, he ﬁnds

the answer limiting and responds with several other questions:

• What happens if the system has only limited/imperfect knowledge of F ?

• What if the true channel differs from F ?

• What if the system has no knowledge of F at all?

Is Alice in a position to make an informed statement about the achievable rates and the corre-

sponding reliability performance of the system under all of the above circumstances? Although

she might be able to give some insights on part of them, Alice has a hard time in giving Bob

technically precise or fully general answers to all questions. This is because, unless F is fully

and perfectly known, it is unclear to Alice how the reliability should be assessed.

B. URLLC Revisited

This paper answers Bob’s questions in a novel statistical framework for design and perfor-

mance assessment. Being inspired by supervised learning, the framework consists of three key

elements: model selection, learning, and rate selection.

Model Selection: As indicated in the above example, when transmitting at rate Rǫ(F ), the

corresponding reliability, assessed in terms of e.g. link outage probability ǫ, can be guaranteed

with certainty only in the case when the system has perfect knowledge of the true distribution F

i.e. the exact channel statistics. Such knowledge is seldom available in practice and in all other

cases the system has to learn, i.e., estimate F . In order to do so, the system ﬁrst selects a model

for F . The choice will, in general, depend on the state of knowledge of the system regarding the

true distribution F . In some cases, a side information on the physical properties of the wireless

channel might be available. For instance, the system might know that the channel exhibits a

strong diffuse/specular component and adopt the Rayleigh/Rician fading model [8]. In other

cases, physical knowledge will be unavailable; hence, no parametric model is suitable, and the

system should resort to non-parametric models. Alternatively, given that in URLLC applications

only the regions of very low outages are of practical interest, the system might resort to simple

and general ﬁrst order approximations of the lower tail of F [5].

Learning: After selecting an appropriate model, the system applies a learning procedure that

generates an estimate of F , denoted by

F , using a ﬁnite number of channel measurements. We

refer to the measurements as the training sample and assume that they are collected in a dedicated

training phase prior to transmission.1 For parametric models including the models based on tail

b

approximations, we use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), as a standard learning tool in

absence of informative priors.

Rate Selection: The estimated distribution

F is a function of the random training sample

which makes it a random quantity itself and is, therefore, inherently uncertain. Choosing the
b

transmission rate as R = Rǫ(

F ) randomizes the outage probability, i.e., different realizations

of the training sample induce different outage probabilities; this is why Alice is unable to give

Bob deterministic reliability guarantees. In other words, the commonly accepted methodology

b

1The reader will note that the deﬁnition of the training phase is vague, i.e., we intentionally do not specify the details on how

the channel training is actually performed. In other words, our analysis is valid for variety of channel training schemes from

conventional, dedicated pilot signals and training sequences, to previous transmissions, where the “training” consists of actual

data transmissions in which feedback about the instantaneous channel quality is received.

of specifying ultra-reliability through an outage probability value is essentially insufﬁcient since,

under limited channel knowledge and uncertainty, the outage probability is a random variable.

In our framework, the system selects the transmission rate such that predeﬁned statistical re-

liability constraints are satisﬁed; hence, the reliability now is guaranteed either on average or

probabilistically. These reliability constraints rely on the statistical characterization of the outage

probability as a random variable and impose limits on some speciﬁc probabilistic measures. We

consider two types of constraints. The ﬁrst type of constraint, termed Averaged Reliability (AR),

controls the mean of the outage probability over all possible realizations of the training sample

and is suitable for designing URLLC systems that perform as desired on the average, over all

transmissions. The second constraint, termed Probably Correct Reliability (PCR), controls the

probability ξ that the outage probability violates ǫ for a given speciﬁc training sample. The latter

constraint is more restrictive and suitable for applications that require tighter, per-transmission

control of the performance of the system. In principle, the second constraint generalizes the ﬁrst

as it provides the system designer with the freedom to control the higher order moments of the

distribution of the outage probability via an additional free parameter ξ. This type of statistical

approach in characterizing the reliability performance probabilistically via two parameters is

reminiscent to the framework of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning [9], [10]. The

reader would recall that the goal in PAC learning, after acquiring the training samples, is to

select a generalization function which, with high probability, has a low generalization error.

Drawing the parallel, in our framework, when designing the URLLC system according to the

second constraint, the goal of the designer, after training the channel, is to select a transmission

rate which with high probability 1

ξ will have link outage probability equal to ǫ. Clearly, in

both frameworks the performance is assessed probabilistically.

−

Consistency and Reliability Assessment: As the size of the training sample grows, we intu-

itively expect that the transmission rate will converge to Alice’s rate, i.e., the maximum achievable

rate Rǫ(F ) for given ǫ when F is perfectly known; we refer to this desired property as consistency.

We observe that ensuring consistency while meeting the statistical reliability requirements is

crucially dependent on the relation between the assumed model and the true distribution.

Summarizing the main ﬁndings, we conclude that the scheme is consistent when

• The assumed model belongs in the same parametric family as F , or

• The system uses a non-parametric model.

In the ﬁrst case, the transmission rate converges rather quickly. However, the assumption of

September 17, 2018

DRAFT

6

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS (2018, SUBMITTED)

knowing which parametric family of models the channel belongs to is a strong one, difﬁcult

to fulﬁll in practice and prone to modeling mismatch which severely violates the reliability

performance. Non-parametric models have generalization power and work for any channel.

Nevertheless, the convergence is slow, requiring prohibitive training sample sizes. Finally, models

based on ﬁrst-order lower tail approximation offer “the best of the two worlds” [5]. Although such

models do not maintain consistency due to inherent mismatch stemming from the approximation

error, they still show superior performance compared to poor parametric modeling choices. In

addition, they also require less channel training compared to non-parametric models.

A ﬁnal remark is in order. Despite the fact that our work is limited to the simple case

of one-way transmission, we note that the statistical treatment we introduce here opens up a

methodology that can be readily extended to more advanced and complex transmission and

networking scenarios that also introduce other sources of uncertainties, such as multiple antenna

techniques, ARQ, interference, etc.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the system model. Sec-

tion III introduces novel statistical reliability constraints and formulates the problem. Sec-

tions IV, V and VI focus on parametric, non-parametric and approximate channel models,

respectively, and derive the corresponding rate-selection functions. Section VII presents and

discusses the numerical evaluations and Section VIII concludes the paper.

Parametric Channel Models: In this case, we assume that F belongs to a parametric family of
with Θ denoting the parameter space. The parameter θ, which

can be a vector or a scalar, usually has a speciﬁc interpretation stemming from the physical

properties of the wireless channel. We review three common parametric models that are widely

used in practice.

Rayleigh channel: Adopted in many wireless studies, the Rayleigh model represents a single

scatterer (i.e. cluster) where the received signal is due to a diffuse component only [8], [11].

The received power Y follows an exponential distribution and, hence, the CDF is given by

Fλ(y) = 1

where λ = E [Y ] denotes the average received power.

Rician channel: The Rician channel is an extension of the Rayleigh fading model, featuring an

additional specular component [8], [11]. Let the power of the specular component be denoted by

ρ, whereas, similarly to the Rayleigh case, the mean power of the diffuse component is denoted

by λ. Let k = ρ/λ

≥

0 be the ratio between the average powers of the specular and diffuse

components, also known as a Rician k-factor. The CDF of the received power under Rician

fading is given as

The special case when k = 0, indicating no specular component, corresponds to Rayleigh-

distributed channel as in (1).

Nakagami-m channel: The extension of the Rayleigh model in multi-cluster settings is the

Nakagami-m model where the received envelope follows the Nakagami distribution with shape

parameter m and scale parameter λ [12]. The Nakagami-m channel can be interpreted as the

incoherent sum of m i.i.d. Rayleigh-type clusters, each with mean diffuse power λ. The CDF

of the received power under Nakagami-m fading is

B. Outage probability

To isolate and study the impact of channel uncertainty, we neglect the impact of noise and

interference and consider errors due to link outage only; link outages are deﬁned by the following

event:

R > log2(1 + Y ).

Hence, the outage probability at transmission rate R is deﬁned as

pF (R) = P[R > log2(1 + Y )] .

(4)

(5)

The goal of ultra-reliable communication is to choose the maximal rate that meets a predeter-

mined reliability constraint, such as

pF (R)

ǫ.

≤

(6)

However, designing the reliability criteria as well as determining the most favorable transmission

rate is strongly linked to the amount of knowledge, i.e., state of knowledge the Tx has about the

true distribution. As illustrated in the following section, specifying the reliability performance

using only (6) when the Tx has limited knowledge of the channel is no longer sufﬁcient.

III. RELIABILITY GUARANTEES UNDER LIMITED CHANNEL KNOWLEDGE

A. Perfect channel knowledge: ǫ-outage capacity

First, consider the benchmark case when the Tx perfectly knows F . In such circumstances, the

Tx can easily determine the maximum rate as a function of F at which the outage probability

is no larger than ǫ, i.e., (6) can be guaranteed deterministically:

Rǫ(F ) = sup

{
= log2

R

≥

0 : pF (R)

ǫ
}

≤

1 + F −1(ǫ)

.

(7)

(8)

The term Rǫ(F ) is also known as the ǫ-outage capacity, whereas F −1(ǫ) is the ǫ-quantile of F .
For parametric models, knowing the channel implies that θ is known perfectly and we use the
notation Rǫ(θ).

B. Limited channel knowledge: MLE of the ǫ-outage capacity

To illustrate the impact of channel uncertainty, consider the following: the Tx knows that
Fθ but has no knowledge of θ. Having acquired a training sample xn prior to transmission,

Y
the Tx can learn θ via MLE as follows

ˆθ(xn)
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

is MLE of the ǫ-outage capacity. Selecting the rate this way is na¨ıve due to the uncertainty of

R(X n), which is itself a random variable. It follows from (5) that different R yields different

outage probability for ﬁxed F ; in other words, the random sequence X n induces a distribution

on the outage probability and the Tx can no longer guarantee with certainty that the outage

probability for the transmission rate R(X n), denoted by pθ(R(X n)), will be less than or equal

to ǫ. In fact, if the probability density function of the outage probability is symmetric (i.e., the
mean and the median coincide), we have that P [pθ(R(X n)) > ǫ] = 0.5 which in some practical

setups, as discussed below, is clearly unacceptable.

C. Problem formulation

The discussion in the previous subsection shows that, when the Tx has a limited knowledge

about the channel, it can only guarantee the reliability in a probabilistic manner. Formally stated,

this is done by deﬁning a rate-selection function R(X n) such that a predetermined statistical

reliability constraint is satisﬁed.

1) Statistical reliability constraints: We consider two different approaches, resulting in two

types of constraints, each of them suited to a speciﬁc set of use cases.

Averaged Reliability (AR): We consider the probability

pF = P [R(X n) > log2(1 + Y )] ,

(11)

computed w.r.t. the joint distribution of X n and Y . Using the law of total expectation, (11) can

be rewritten as

September 17, 2018

X n]]

|

= E[pF (R(X n))] ,

(12)

(13)

DRAFT

10

where the outer expectation is taken over the distribution of the training sample X n. It follows

that pF is the mean of the outage probability, as deﬁned in (5), averaged over the training sample
X n.

We consider the reliability constraint

which controls the worst-case mean outage probability over the whole class

ﬁrm reliability guarantee.

(14)

and provides a

F

The mean outage probability (11) can be used when the Tx’s objective is to optimize the

transmission rate jointly over the training and the transmission, when channel training is per-

formed prior to each transmission. This approach is suitable in a dynamic environment in which

the channel changes frequently, requiring frequent channel training and estimation; an example

of this is a vehicular communication scenario.

Probably Correct Reliability (PCR): Differently from the cases suited for AR, in many URLLC

applications, such as monitoring and control in power grids or automated production in industrial

complexes, the environment remains reasonably static for long periods of time. In such cases, it

makes sense to train the channel infrequently implying that the most recent channel estimate will

be used by the system over many future transmissions. Clearly, the Tx has to be more conservative

here and choose the rate such that the outage probability in all the following transmissions is

below ǫ with high probability.

This scenario is captured by PCR, which is more restrictive and effectively controls the higher

order moments of the distribution of the outage probability. PCR is suitable when the Tx sets

the transmission rate for all future transmissions after obtaining the training sample. We rely on

the concept of meta-probability [13] and introduce:

pF = P [P[R(X n) > log2(1 + Y )

X n] > ǫ]

= P[pF (R(X n)) > ǫ] ,

where the outer probability is computed w.r.t. the joint distribution of the training sample X n.

ξ is the conﬁdence parameter that indicates how likely it is to meet the reliability requirement

[10].

2) Rate-selection function: There is a whole family of rate-selection functions R(X n) that

satisfy (14) or (17). In order to ﬁnd the most favorable, one should introduce an objective function

of R(X n) and deﬁne an optimization problem that will give the optimal rate-selection function

subject to (14)/(17). A possible objective function might be the ratio

(cid:3)

(18)

between the throughput using R(X n) and the optimal throughput, given that F is known perfectly.

Formulating such optimization problem using (18) is a non-trivial task and therefore out of the

scope of the paper. One issue is the fact that (18) depends on a speciﬁc and ﬁxed true distribution

F while our aim is to design a robust rate-selection function that maximizes the transmission

rate over potentially large class

of channel distributions.

F

In the rest of the paper, we will limit our discussion to the heuristic, yet intuitive choice,

inspired by the na¨ıve, MLE-based approach described in the previous subsection. Namely, the

Tx uses

R(X n) = log2

1 +

F −1(εn)

,

(19)

where

F −1(εn) is an estimate of the εn-quantile of the channel for some positive sequence
εn > 0 and training sample X n. The objective now is to ﬁnd εn that maximizes R(X n) while

meeting either (14) or (17). Note that if εn = ǫ for every n, we have the plug-in solution where

R(X n) is just the MLE of the ǫ-outage capacity. Note that the rate-selection function (19) is still

an estimate of the ǫ-outage capacity; however, by choosing εn such that (14)/(17) is satisﬁed,

intuitively the Tx controls the uncertainty of the transmission rate introduced by limited channel

knowledge.

We next introduce the notion of consistency. Namely, a rate-selection function is said to be

consistent if R(X n) converges to the ǫ-outage capacity Rǫ(F ) as n

with probability 1 for

→ ∞

all F

∈ F

while simultaneously satisfying either (14) or (17). In such case

lim
n→∞

ωn

ǫ (F ) = 1.

(20)

Clearly, consistent rate-selection functions are desirable, but, depending on the relation between

the model and the true distribution, not always possible. Speciﬁcally, if there is a model mismatch,

such that the model differs from the actual channel distribution, then the rate-selection function

will not be consistent and limn→∞ ωn

ǫ (F )

= 1. This phenomenon, which can be also linked to

the bias-variance trade-off [10], is discussed in more detail in the following section.

IV. PARAMETRIC RATE-SELECTION FUNCTIONS

We begin by considering parametric channel models. In this case, (19) can be rewritten as

R(X n) = Rεn

ˆθ(X n)
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(21)

for some εn > 0; here, ˆθ is the MLE of the parameter θ using the training sample X n. We
illustrate some of our main insights through several case studies for which we impose different

assumptions regarding the true distribution and the state of knowledge at the Tx. In particular,

we focus on the following cases:

1) The channel is Rayleigh-distributed and the Tx knows this; however, the Tx has no knowl-

edge of λ.

2) The channel is not Rayleigh distributed and the Tx does not know this; nevertheless, the

Tx still assumes that the channel is Rayleigh-distributed, with unknown λ.

For known λ, the ǫ-outage capacity is easily computed as

Rǫ(λ) = log2(1

λ log(1

ǫ)) .

(22)

Note that, even for the simple and intuitive choice (21), ﬁnding εn that maximizes R(X n) such

that (14)/(17) is satisﬁed, is a non-trivial exercise for most of the remaining parametric channel

models and one needs to resort to numerical methods to compute the transmission rate.

B. Mismatch: The true distribution is not Rayleigh

Next, we study the impact of channel mismatch on the reliability performance of the system.

We assume that the channel is no longer Rayleigh, i.e., Fθ is different from (1); yet, the Tx

maintains the assumption that the channel is Rayleigh, setting the rate as in (23) with εn computed

via (27)/(32). Due to mismatch, the rate-selection function can no longer be guaranteed to be
consistent, i.e., R(X n) does not converge to Rǫ(θ) computed w.r.t. the true distribution Fθ. As
a result, one can no longer guarantee that the reliability constraints (14) or (17) will be satisﬁed.

Given that the Tx sets the transmission rate as in (23), the mean outage probability (11) and

the meta-probability (15) can be written as

where the outer expectations are taken w.r.t. the true distribution Fθ. The above quantities can

be easily evaluated numerically for any Fθ. To gain more insight into the impact of channel mis-

match, we derive simple approximations relaying on the assumption that the outage probability

conditioned on xn is small, i.e., in the order of ǫ. In such case, for wide variety of channels, Fθ

can be approximated via simple power law (see [5] for detailed derivations based on ﬁrst-order

approximations for different channels and Section VI for an argument from the extreme value

theory)

where αθ and κθ depend on the true distribution Fθ. Then, we obtain the simple approximations

for the empirical channel mean, the mean outage probability is always smaller than the target

ǫ, i.e., the transmission rate will always be pessimistic and lower than the maximum rate the

Rician channel can support for outage ǫ.

Now, let us consider the Nakagami-m channel for 0.5

It is easy to check that for 0.5

transmission rate will be always optimistic and larger than the maximum rate the Nakagami-m

the diffuse component, the Rayleigh CDF (1) is always an upper/lower bound bound on the

Rician/Nakagami-m (for m < 1) CDFs given in (2)/(3).

Another interesting observation that can be deduced from (26), (40) and (42) is the impact of

the training sample size n on the convergence. Provided that εn is selected as in (27), we have

V. NON-PARAMETRIC RATE-SELECTION FUNCTIONS

Using non-parametric rate-selection approach is suitable when the Tx has no, or very limited

knowledge of the channel distribution and is unwilling to impose assumptions that might lead

to mismatch and compromise the reliability performance. Clearly, one major advantage of the

non-parametric approach is its generality and versatility, i.e., it is applicable to wide variety of

channels, subject only to some smoothness constraints, such as e.g. existence of the ﬁrst-order

derivative of F . However, this comes at the expense of the duration of the channel training

phase; in general, non-parametric approaches often require excessive training sample lengths for

reasonably reliable system performance.

A. Non-parametric estimation of the ǫ-outage capacity

Similarly as in the parametric case, we will ﬁrst look into the plug-in estimate of the ǫ-outage

capacity. We consider a general case: Y is drawn from an arbitrary distribution F , deﬁned over

the non-negative reals. Consider a speciﬁc training sample xn; the empirical CDF

samples in purely non-parametric setup grows as

B. Non-parametric rate-selection function

We see from (56) that in non-parametric setup the l-th order statistic x(l) is an estimate of the

ǫ-quantile. Motivated by this, for a given training sample xn, the Tx ﬁxes the rate as

and chooses the largest l that meets the statistical reliability constraints. Thus, using (58), the

outage probability (5) conditioned on X n obtains the simple form

pF (R(X n)) = P [R(X n)

= F (X(l)).

(59)

(60)

Now, let U1, . . . , Un be independent random variables uniformly distributed [0, 1]. Then, F (X(l))

has the same distribution as U(l) which is beta-distributed with shape parameters l and n + 1

With this property, we easily evaluate the mean outage probability (11) as

l.

Clearly, the mean outage does not depend on F and supF ∈F pF = l/(n+1). Hence, the constraint

(63)

From the above rate-selection rule, it is evident that when the number of training samples

VI. POWER LAW APPROXIMATION OF THE CHANNEL TAIL

In Section IV, we saw that the training sample size required to learn the channel for parametric

channel models is relatively low; however, the model mismatch may have a signiﬁcant impact on

the realized reliability. The non-parametric method in Section V does not suffer from this draw-

back, but requires a training sample size of the order 1/ǫ which is enormous for many practical

applications. This section takes an approximate approach using power law approximations and

asymptotic properties. To this end, we ﬁrst argue why the power law approximation for lower

tail of F , introduced in (35) is of interest.

The Pickands-Balkema-de Haan theorem theorem (see [14, Th. 2.1.1] or [15, Th. 21.17]) in

extreme value theory states that, for a large class of distributions F , there exists a constant κ > 0

such that

for every y > 0. Hence, justifying the use of the power law approximation

≈

The importance of the power law approximation is that it allows one to treat the tail of any

distribution F , satisfying the conditions stated before, as a parametric distribution of only two

parameters. We remark that there are three domains of attraction for the extreme value distribution

and that (67) only captures one of these, see [5] for a list of common fading distributions

satisfying the power law approximation and [14, Th. 2.1.2] sufﬁcient conditions. As a result, we

can take an approach similar to the one in Section IV for parametric distributions even though

no full parameterization of F is given.

In order to estimate α and κ, we shall apply a variation of the ML estimator. In particular, given

a training sample zn and a small constant β, we use only the l =

βn

z(1), . . . , z(l) and choose the parameters ˆα and ˆκ such that the likelihood f (z(1), . . . , z(l); ˆα, ˆκ) is

maximized. The intuition is that only the smallest observations contain information about the

tail of F .

This approximate approach has some clear disadvantages; namely, the range of validity of the

power law approximation depends crucially on the value of β and on the true distribution F .

Hence, no strict statistical guarantees can be derived. It is, however, worth noting that in cases

where no parameterization of F is available, only the non-parametric approach can provide

such true statistical guarantees for reliability at the expense of a large required sample size, and

approximate statistical guarantees may therefore be favored.

By using the power law approximation in (68) for approximating f (z(1), . . . , z(l); ˆα, ˆκ), we

ﬁnd that [16, Sec. 7.2.4]

VII. NUMERICAL EVALUATION

Before presenting the result, we advise the reader to refer to the caption of the individual

ﬁgures for details regarding the notation of the curves.

We begin by considering transmission over Rayleigh ﬂat fading channel with average received

power λ = 1. Fig. 1 shows the throughput ratio ωn

ǫ (λ) as deﬁned in (18) for parametric (21)
(square markers) and non-parametric (circle markers) rate-selection functions (58) for different

training sample lengths n and ǫ

10−3, 10−4, 10−5

∈ {

. We observe that the parametric and non-
}

parametric rate-selection functions are consistent; the oscillations in the non-parametric case arise
N. We also observe that the parametric rate-selection functions converge signiﬁcantly

due to (l)

∈

faster to the ǫ-outage capacity. As expected, the non-parametric rate-selection functions require n

to be of the order 1/ǫ to produce non-zero throughput; the meta-probability constraint requires

n to be even larger, almost an order of magnitude larger than the mean outage probability

constraint.

We observe that ωn

ǫ (λ) approaches 1 faster when the rate-selection follows the mean outrage
probability constraint (14) (ﬁlled markers) as opposed to meta-probability constraint (17) (empty

markers); in fact, ωn

ǫ (λ)

1 and R(xn)

≈

≈

Rǫ(λ) even for n < 10. This is expected since the

mean outage probability depends very weakly on n (see (43)). In contrast, the rate under meta-

probability constraint converges slower which is also intuitively expected due to the strictness

of the constraint. An interesting observation follows from Fig. 1: the convergence rate under

the parametric rate-selection function appears to be (almost) independent from ǫ for ﬁxed ξ,

implying that the rate-selection function obtained for given ξ via (32) is valid for any ǫ. In

Fig. 2 we depict the throughput ratio under meta-probability constraint for different values

outage probability. In fact, when the distribution of the outage probability is symmetric, i.e., its

mean coincides with the median, the meta-probability constraint for ξ = 0.5 is equivalent to the

mean outage probability constraint. Hence, even though rigorously precise only in the case of

symmetric outage probability distribution, the meta-probability constraint (14) can, in general,

be viewed as generalization of the mean outage probability constraint (17).

Fig. 3 evaluates the impact of mismatched model on the reliability performance: the Tx adopts

Rayleigh model (ﬁlled markers), but the true distribution is different. We ﬁx ǫ and ξ, we choose

n to be large enough to ensure convergence and we plot the mean outage probability and the

meta-probability as a function of the true channel distribution as speciﬁed by the corresponding

parameters. In Fig. 3a, the channel follows Rice distribution (2) and we plot the reliability

performance for a range of k-factors: note that, we plot both (33)/(34) with the corresponding

approximations (36)/(37) (dotted lines), conﬁrming that the latter approximate the former well

for small ǫ and ξ. As already discussed in Section IV-B, assuming Rayleigh when the actual

fading is Rician, always gives a pessimistic rate-selection function, i.e., the throughput ratio

is strictly less than 1; in fact, as the specular component becomes stronger, the throughput

becomes even lower. We conclude that by assuming Rayleigh, i.e., k = 0 when k > 0, the

reliability constraints (14) and (17) will never be violated. However, this comes at the price of

under-utilizing the degrees of freedom offered by the Rician channel; under meta-probability

dropping and pushing the throughput towards 0. For Fig. 3b the true distribution is Nakagami-m

(3) and it shows the reliability performance for different values of m. For m > 1, the behavior is

similar to the Rician case. However, the numerical evaluations suggest that the under-utilization

is more severe; already for m = 2, which corresponds to two Rayleigh-type of clusters, both

the mean outage probability and the meta-probability are several order of magnitudes below the

thresholds, implying that the throughput is very low. We observe opposite behavior for m < 1

(which we also predicted in Section IV-B). Here, the rate-selection function gives optimistic rates,

larger than the corresponding ǫ-outage capacity; such rates violate the reliability constraints to

produce throughput ratio larger than 1. Once again, the meta-probability shows severe under/over-

utilization, quickly dropping/jumping towards 0/1.

The performance of the parametric and non-parametric rate-selection functions can be also

linked to the bias-variance trade-off. Namely, learning parametric models via MLE produces

estimates with small variance which explains the relatively fast convergence of the rate, but they

can be heavily biased in case of model mismatch. On the other hand, in the non-parametric

approach the εn-quantile is estimated with a small bias but a large variance; hence, it works for

any distribution F but requires a large number of samples.

The asymptotic rate-selection functions based on power law tail approximation address the

trade-off among consistency, training sample length, and mismatch. Fig. 4 compares the perfor-

mance of the power law tail approach against parametric/non-parametric rate-selection functions

with Rayleigh true distribution; in such case κ = 1, α = 1/λ. Clearly, the throughput ratio con-

verges faster than the non-parametric case, which is particularly evident for the meta-probability

constraint. Note that the approach requires l

2, i.e., n

2/β samples. Also, for small l

≥
(less than 10 in this case study), the estimators (72) and (73) over-estimate κ and α. For the

≥

meta-probability constraint, this effect is (partially) alleviated by using εn chosen according to

the upper bound (81) at the expense of slower convergence. The rate-selection function (76) also

suffers from mismatch due to approximation error; therefore, the approach does not guarantee

consistency.

To investigate the effect, Fig. 3 shows the reliability performance of the approach (empty

markers), compared against the case of incorrect model assumption. In both Figs. 3a and 3b,

we see that even in Rayleigh case (k = 0 or m = 1, recall the special cases of the Rician

or Nakagami-m channel in Section II) there is slight bias in the reliability performance which

is more evident for the meta-probability constraint; hence, the rate is slightly inconsistent due

to the approximation error. When the true distribution is Ricean, we see that the power law

tail approach violates both constraints for large k, producing optimistic rates; similarly, in the

case of Nakagami-m and m < 1, the approach gives optimistic rates. This is due to the fact

that the power law tail approximation is a lower bound of the respective cdfs (see [5] for more

details). Oppositely, for large enough m > 1 in the Nakagami-m channel, the approach leads to

pessimistic rates since the power law approximation becomes an upper bound [5].

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

The strict requirements of URLLC systems demand from us to reconsider the usual ways the

physical layer is designed and its performance assessed. Our study shows that the phenomena of

channel uncertainty strongly impact the performance in UR-relevant regime of operation, in the

sense that the targeted reliability can no longer be guaranteed with certainty. Motivated by this,

we introduced novel statistical framework in which the transmitter, given its best knowledge of

the true channel distribution, determines the physical layer parameters, namely the transmission

rate such that the reliability is guaranteed probabilistically. We showed that the approach based on

parametric channel models requires the least amount of channel training but is highly susceptible

to modeling mismatch. Non-parametric approaches do not suffer from such mismatch since they

do not impose assumptions; however, the training sample sizes tend to be prohibitively large. As

a consensus between the parametric and non-parametric approaches, the design approach based

on the power law tail approximations offers versatile performance that reduces both, the impact

of modeling mismatch and the training sample sizes.

The main lesson from our study is the implication that attaining and guaranteeing the strict

performance requirements in URLLC-relevant regimes of operation solely by adequate design

of the physical layer is a challenging task. The reader should note that apart from link outages,

our study does not consider other effects such as noise, interference or equipment imperfections;

combined, all of these effects would make it even more challenging to guarantee the reliability

performance. All of this suggest that the physical layer design in URLLC system should incor-

porate more advanced technologies that rely on diversity such as multiple antenna techniques

which is part of our on-going research.
