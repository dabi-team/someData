Abstract

Kitazawa (2013, 2016) showed that the common parameters in the panel logit AR(1)

model with strictly exogenous covariates and ﬁxed eﬀects are estimable at the root-n

rate using the Generalized Method of Moments. Honor´e and Weidner (2020) extended

his results in various directions: they found additional moment conditions for the logit

AR(1) model and also considered estimation of logit AR(p) models with p > 1.
In
this note we prove a conjecture in their paper and show that 2T − 2T of their moment

functions for the logit AR(1) model are linearly independent and span the set of valid
moment functions, which is a 2T − 2T -dimensional linear subspace of the 2T -dimensional
vector space of real valued functions over the outcomes y ∈ {0, 1}T . We also prove that
when p = 2 and T ∈ {3, 4, 5}, there are, respectively, 2T − 4(T − 1) and 2T − (3T − 2)

linearly independent moment functions for the panel logit AR(2) models with and without

covariates.

1 Proof of a conjecture in Honor´e and Weidner (2020)

We adopt the notation of Honor´e and Weidner (2020). Their conjecture in p.17 is

that for γ0 6= 0 (and arbitrary y0, x and β0; index i is omitted) any moment func-
tion my0(y, x, β, γ) = w(y1, ..., yt−1)m(a/b)(t,s,r)
(y, x, β, γ) for the panel logit AR(1) model
with strictly exogenous regressors and T ≥ 3 can be written as

(t, s, y1, ..., yt−1, x, β, γ) ∈ R that are uniquely determined by the func-

tion my0(., x, β, γ).

We will prove this conjecture by showing (i) that the set of valid moment func-
tions is a linear subspace of the 2T -dimensional vector space of real valued functions
over the outcomes y ∈ {0, 1}T that has a dimension of at most 2T − 2T and (ii)
that the 2T − 2T functions of the form wy1,...,yt−1(y1, ..., yt−1)m(a/b)(t,s,T )
(y, x, β, γ), where
wy1,...,yt−1(y1, ..., yt−1) : {0, 1}t−1 → {0, 1} are 2t−1 linearly independent indicator functions
and 1 ≤ t < s < T, are linearly independent and span this subspace.

Proof:

Recall that

P r(Yi = yi|Yi0 = yi0, Xi = xi, Ai = αi) ≡

pyi0(yi, xi, β0, γ0, αi) =

Y

We drop the index i. A valid moment function my0(y, x, β, γ) satisﬁes

E[my0(Y, X, β0, γ0)|Y0 = y0, X = x, A = α] = 0 for all α ∈ R

or equivalently

py0(y, x, β0, γ0, α)my0(y, x, β0, γ0) = 0 for all α ∈ R.

Let T ≥ 2 and α1 < α2 < ... < α2T . Deﬁne the 2T × 2T matrix ¯P with typical element

¯Pg,h = py0(y, x, β0, γ0, αg) for g ∈ {1, 2, ..., 2T } and h = 1 + 20y1 + 21y2 + ... + 2T −1yT .

h = 1 + 20y1 + 21y2 + ... + 2T −1yT .

Q

Note that ˘P = D ¯P ˘D for some nonsingular diagonal matrices D = D(x, β0, γ0, α) and

˘D = ˘D(γ0). Hence rk( ˘P ) = rk( ¯P ).

We now show (i). If the model does not contain covariates, i.e., if β0 = 0, then ˘P
does not depend on x and there exist 2T − rk( ˘P ) linearly independent moment functions,

which will not depend on x. Furthermore, the number of linearly independent moment

functions available for the model without covariates is at least as large as the number of

linearly independent moment functions available for the model that does include them,
i.e., that allows β0 6= 0. In the appendix we show that rk( ˘P ) ≥ 2T irrespective of whether
β0 = 0 or β0 6= 0, that is, we prove Lemma 1, which states that the 2T columns of ˘P
corresponding to vectors y with either the ﬁrst k or the last k elements equal to 1 and
the remaining elements (if any) equal to 0 for k = 0, 1, 2, ...T are linearly independent. 1
Recall that rk( ˘P ) = rk( ¯P ). It follows that claim (i) is correct. We now show (ii):

the moment

functions wy1,...,yt1

−1(y1, ..., yt1−1)×
m(a/b)(t1 ,s1,T )
(y, x, β, γ) with t1 < s1 < T are linearly independent of wy1,...,yt−1(y1, ..., yt−1)×
m(a/b)(t,s,T )
(y, x, β, γ) with t < s < T and (t, s) 6= (t1, s1) because only the former depend
on exp[±zt1,s1(y0, y, x, β, γ)], where zt1,s1(y0, y, x, β, γ) = (xt1 − xs1)′β + γ(yt1−1 − ys1−1).
This is still true when β = 0. Furthermore, for any t1 and s1 with t1 < s1 < T ,
−1(y1, ..., yt1−1)m(a/b)(t1,s1,T )
the moment functions wy1,...,yt1
are linearly independent be-
cause wy1,...,yt−1(y1, ..., yt−1) are linearly independent indicator functions and m(a)(t1,s1,T )
and m(b)(t1,s1,T )
are linearly independent. Hence the 2T − 2T functions of the form
y0
wy1,...,yt−1(y1, ..., yt−1)m(a/b)(t,s,T )
(y, x, β, γ) are linearly independent. They are also valid
moment functions. It follows that they span a 2T − 2T -dimensional linear subspace of
the 2T -dimensional vector space of real valued functions over the outcomes y ∈ {0, 1}T

that contains the valid moment functions.

Remark 1: The analysis above is also valid when there are no covariates, i.e., β0 = 0.

1More generally, any 2T columns of ˘P will be linearly independent if they correspond to
the following 2T y-vectors: the two y-vectors that satisfy yS = 0 or yS = T and for each k ∈
{1, 2, ..., T − 1} two y-vectors that satisfy yS = k, one with yT = 0 and the other with yT = 1.

2

Remark 2: When β0 6= 0, then ˘P depends on the xi and it may well be the case
that rk( ˘P ) > 2T. However, this does not contradict the existence of 2T − 2T linearly

independent moment functions, because for each individual i, they will depend on xi.
On the other hand, when β0 = 0, then ˘P does not depend on the xi and hence there
exist 2T − rk( ˘P ) linearly independent moment functions, which will not depend on the
xi. This and part (ii) of the proof in turn imply that when β0 = 0, then rk( ˘P ) = 2T .

Remark 3: It follows from the result under (i) that there are no valid moment functions

when T = 2. In other words, GMM estimation of the panel logit AR(1) model with ﬁxed

eﬀects and possibly strictly exogenous covariates is not possible for T = 2. Our proof is

more general than that of Honor´e and Weidner (2020) for this claim because we also cover

the case where the values of α can only be ﬁnite. In their proof, Honor´e and Weidner

(2020) chose two of the four diﬀerent values of α equal to ±∞, which leads to probabilities

that are equal to 1 for the events where all elements of y are either zero or one. This

unnecessarily restricts the moment functions a priori. In contrast, we also allow all the

probabilities of observing a y-vector with only zeros or only ones to be less than 1.

Remark 4: The analysis above can also be extended to panel logit AR(p) models with

ﬁxed eﬀects and p > 1.

T

Remark 5: The analysis above can also be used for the static panel logit model, i.e.,
g,t. When also β0 = 0, ˘P is equal to a matrix with
when γ0 = 0. In that case ˘Pg,h =
P yt
columns from a Vandermonde matrix of rank T + 1. It follows that when γ0 = 0, the set
of valid moment functions is a linear subspace of the 2T -dimensional vector space of real
valued functions over the outcomes y ∈ {0, 1}T that has at most dimension 2T − (T + 1)

and in particular that when T = 2, there exists at most one valid moment condition.

for g ∈ {1, 2, ..., 2T } and h = 1 + 20y1 +

(cid:16)
˘P = D ¯P ˘D for some nonsingular diagonal matrices D = D(x, β0, γ0, α) and ˘D = ˘D(γ0).
The formula for ˘Pg,h suggests that a second conjecture of Honor´e and Weidner (2020),
henceforth H&W, namely that the number of linearly independent moment functions for
the general panel logit AR(p) models with covariates is given by l = 2T − (T + 1 − p)2p,

(cid:17)

is plausible: when p increases by one, the number of factors under the product sign Π

decreases by one (this number equals T − 2 when p = 2), which explains the (T + 1 − p)

part of the formula, while the number of possible values for a p-tuple (yt, yt−1, . . . , yt−p+1),
namely 2p, doubles. To prove H&W’s second conjecture for p > 1, one can in principle

follow a similar proof strategy as for the case where p = 1. However, when p > 1,

things are a bit more complicated. As H&W demonstrate, when p > 1, the number

of linearly independent moment functions for the general panel logit AR(p) model is

smaller than the number of linearly independent moment functions for the panel logit

AR(p) model without covariates (i.e., with β0 = 0). One can relatively easily establish
the latter number for diﬀerent values of T by using a proof strategy similar to that for

the case p = 1. The diﬀerence between the two numbers of moment functions is equal

to the number of linearly independent ”special” moment functions that are only valid

for ”special” versions of the model, e.g. the model with β0 = 0, but not for the general
model. Thus by subtracting the number of these special moment functions from the total

number of linearly independent moment functions for the model with β0 = 0, one obtains
the number of linearly independent moment functions for the general model.

H&W claim that they have found all moment functions for the general model when

T ≤ 5. However, their claim is premature as they have not shown that there cannot be
more than l moment functions for the general model when T ≤ 5. 2 We have shown this

2H&W have found one moment function for the panel logit AR(2) model with β0 = 0 (given
the value of y(0)) when T = 3, which is a special case of a moment function that is only valid
when x2 = x3. However, they have not shown that when T = 3, there is only one moment
function for this model.

above for p = 1 (and any T ) and we will show this in the appendix for p = 2 and T ≤ 5.

For the panel logit AR(2) model without covariates (i.e., with β = 0), one can show
that rk( ˘P ) = 4(T − 1) − (T − 2) = 3T − 2, so that there are 2T − (3T − 2) linearly
independent moment functions available for this model. 3 One can easily obtain these
by solving the system ˆP[3T −2] ¯M3T −2 = 0, where ˆP[3T −2] = ˆP[3T −2](eγ1, eγ2) is a (3T −
2) × 2T matrix that consists of (any) 3T − 2 rows of the matrix ¯P ˘D, each evaluated
at/corresponding to diﬀerent values for the αg, and ¯M3T −2 is a 2T × (2T − (3T − 2))
matrix with rk( ¯M3T −2) = 2T − (3T − 2). The 2T − (3T − 2) columns of ¯M3T −2 span the
nullspace of ¯P ˘D, which is the space of valid moment functions for the panel logit AR(2)

model without covariates.

P2(S+2)) and one other term, (which itself is the result of

2(S+2)

summing almost all terms that appear in the aforementioned expansion of det(M) except
for det(DS+2
P2(S+2)), and) which is an expression that is given by a ratio with the factor
eα2S+6 − eα2S+5 raised to some positive power appearing in the denominator (as a common

2(S+2)

e

factor) and with the same factor also appearing in the numerator but raised to lower

positive powers than its power in the denominator so that its presence in the numerator
does not completely cancel out this factor in the denominator. 4 However, none of the
elements of DS+2
P2(S+2) depend on eα2S+5 or eα2S+6. It follows that det(M) 6= 0 a.s.

2(S+2)
P2(S+3) is invertible a.s. (as we have already seen that det(F ) 6= 0), i.e.,

and that

P =

P2(S+3)) = 2(S + 3) a.s. Another way of seeing this is that det(M) can be expressed
rank(
as a ratio with a numerator that is a polynomial in eαg for g = 1, 2, . . . , 2(S + 2), in eγ

and, unless the second term (”the other term”) in the aforementioned sum of two terms
is zero (in which case det(M) = det(DS+2
P2(S+2)) 6= 0 a.s.), also in eα2S+5 and eα2S+6.
Hence det(M) = 0 if and only if this numerator equals zero. Given values of eαg for
g = 1, 2, . . . , 2(S + 2) and eγ, the numerator is a polynomial in eα2S+5 and eα2S+6 with

2(S+2)

e

a ﬁnite number of roots. As the values of αg, g = 1, 2, . . . , 2(S + 3), and γ 6= 0 can

be assumed to be randomly drawn from some continuous distribution(s), the probability
that the values of eα2S+5 and eα2S+6 coincide with these roots is negligible. It follows that

Pr(det(M) 6= 0) = 1 and hence that Pr(det(

P2(S+3)) 6= 0) = 1.

The arguments generalize to the case where β 6= 0.

Q.E.D.

An alternative proof of the claim that rk( ¯P ) = 2T for the panel logit AR(1) model

without covariates (i.e., with β0 = 0):

that ¨P = ¨D ˘P for some nonsingular diagonal matrix ¨D = ¨D(γ0, α) and that the columns

of ¨P correspond to diﬀerent polynomials in Pg,1 up to order 2T − 1 with all intermediate
powers occuring somewhere inside ¨P . It follows that rk( ¯P ) = rk( ¨P ) is equal to the rank

4We have not investigated whether this second term (expression) in the sum is zero. If the
P2(S+2)) 6= 0 a.s., i.e., det(M ) 6= 0

latter were the case, we would have det(M ) = det(DS+2
a.s., which is what we want to show.

that is based on powers of Pg,1 and has rank 2T. Hence rk( ¯P ) = rk( ¨P ) ≤ 2T. To prove
that rk( ¯P ) = rk( ¨P ) = 2T, it suﬃces to show that rk( ¨P ) ≥ 2T. This can be done by
selecting the same 2T columns of ¨P as those of ˘P that underlie the deﬁnition of the

Proof of the second conjecture of H&W (2020) for p = 2 and T ∈ {3, 4, 5}:

We have followed the proof strategy above to show that when p = 2 and β0 = 0,
then rk( ¯P ) = 3T − 2 for all T ∈ {3, 4, 5} and any y0 ∈ {0, 1}. In particular, we have
used Mathematica to verify that when p = 2 and β0 = 0, then rk( ¨P ) = 3T − 2 for all
T ∈ {3, 4, 5} and any y0 ∈ {0, 1}. We note that when p = 2, T = 3 and x2 = x3, there

is (at least) one extra moment function relative to the number of linearly independent
moment functions for the general model (given the value of y(0)), cf. H&W (2020) who

found one extra moment function for this case; by analogy, when p = 2, T = 4 and

x2 = x3 = x4, there will be (at least) two extra moment functions relative to the number
of linearly independent moment functions for the general model (given the value of y(0));

and when p = 2, T = 5 and x2 = x3 = x4 = x5, there will be (at least) three extra

moment functions relative to the number of linearly independent moment functions for
the general model (given the value of y(0)). H&W (2020) also found l = 2T − 4(T − 1)
linearly independent moment functions for the general model (given the value of y(0))

when p = 2 and T ∈ {3, 4, 5}, so there are at least l of them in these cases. Hence

the number of linearly independent ”general” and ”special” moment functions is at least
2T − 4(T − 1) + (T − 2) = 2T − (3T − 2). However, this number cannot be larger than the

number of linearly independent moment functions for the model without covariates (i.e.,
with β0 = 0), which is 2T − (3T − 2). We conclude that when p = 2 and T ∈ {3, 4, 5},
there are 2T − (3T − 2) − (T − 2) = 2T − 4(T − 1) = l linearly independent moment
functions for the general model (given the value of y(0)).
