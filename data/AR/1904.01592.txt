explanation for overabundances in winds from X-ray

ABSTRACT
Multiple spectroscopic lines of diﬀerent elements observed in winds from X-ray binaries
(XRBs), based on one zone model, indicate super-solar abundance of elements, e.g.
Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Co. The one zone model considers similar hydrodynamics
of underlying winds. In order to ﬁnd a possible origin of these overabundances, we
explore nucleosynthesis in advective, geometrically thick, sub-Keplerian, accretion disc
in XRBs and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and further in outﬂows launched from
the disc. Based on ﬂow hydrodynamics and solving nuclear network code therein by
semi-implicit Euler method, we obtain abundance evolution of the elements. Although
the density is very low, due to very high temperature of advective disc than Keplerian
Shakura-Sunyaev disc (SSD), it is quite evident that signiﬁcant nucleosynthesis occurs
in the former. As the temperature at the base of the outﬂow is constrained by the
temperature of disc, nucleosynthesis also occurs in the outﬂow contingent upon its
launching temperature. Till now, the outer region of XRB and AGN discs is understood
to be colder SSD and inner region to be advective disc, together forming a disc-wind
system. Hence, newly evolved abundances after processing through outﬂow can change
the abundances of diﬀerent elements present in the environment of the whole disc-wind
system. We ﬁnd 2-6 times overabundant Mg, Si, Ar, Cr with respect to the respective
solar abundances, which is consistent observationally. Thus for most XRBs, when only
iron lines are present, inclusion of these evolved abundances is expected to change the
observational analysis drastically.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advective accretion disc arises when accretion rate is
low. Due to their low density and shorter residence time,
protons are unable to transfer their energy to electrons and
two-temperature plasma comes in the picture. Such discs are
optically thin, geometrically thick and their ion temperature
could reach the virial value ∼ (1/k)(GM mp/rs) ∼ 5.4×1012
K, if there is no cooling. Here k and G are the Boltzmann
and gravitational constants, M is the mass of black hole, mp
is the mass of proton, rs = 2GM/c2 is the Schwarzschild ra-
dius and c is the speed of light in vacuum. Realistically,
electron temperature goes to ∼ 109 K, whereas ion temper-
ature reaches to ∼ 1011 K. This temperature is too high for

nucleosynthesis, i.e. at this temperature all the nuclei will
be disintegrated into free nucleons−neutrons and protons.

On the other hand, there is another accretion disc
regime, which is most established, known as Shakura-
Sunyaev disc (SSD) model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). SSD
is optically thick and geometrically thin and arises when ac-
cretion rate is relatively high. Due to large optical depth, it
radiates as multi-temperature blackbody and temperature
attains at most ∼ 107 K. Although in this disc, density is
higher, temperature is too low for nucleosynthesis, because
reaction rates are highly sensitive to the temperature.

In between these two extreme regimes, there is an ac-
cretion zone which is also sub-Keplerian and advective in
nature. The temperature therein is to be adequate to kick
in nucleosynthesis. In very inner region of such regime, the
temperature may turn out to be too high to disintegrate all
the nuclei, as mentioned above.

Till now the best understanding is that in the outer

region of the X-ray binary accretion disc around a compact
object (XRB), the colder Keplerian SSD is present and in the
inner region, sub-Keplerian hotter advective disc is present
(e.g. Chakrabarti & Titarchuk 1995; Narayan et al. 1998;
Zhang 2013, and references therein). The same is true for
accretion disc around a supermassive black hole, i.e. in an
active galactic nucleus (AGN). We see XRBs in soft or hard
states, depending on the dominance of SSD or advective
disc components respectively. Therefore, considering only
the temperature, it is justiﬁed to say that in accretion disc,
there will be nucleosynthesis, i.e. abundance of the ﬂow will
evolve, as it goes from outer edge to the near black hole.

Many earlier works were devoted to nucleosynthesis
in a XRBs as well as AGNs. Chakrabarti et al. (1987)
and Jin et al. (1989) basically initiated nucleosynthesis
in an optically thick SSD. They found that signiﬁcant
nucleosynthesis happens in the disc only when the viscosity
parameter αvisc (cid:54) 10−4. This is because temperature
and density increase and radial velocity decreases with
decreasing αvisc. However, this range of αvisc
is not
consistent observationally (King et al. 2007). Chakrabarti
& Mukhopadhyay (1999) studied nucleosynthesis in hot,
highly viscous advective accretion ﬂows with small accretion
rates and showed that neutron tori can form around a
black hole due to disintegration of all the elements into
free nucleons, which matches with the results presented in
this work. Mukhopadhyay & Chakrabarti (2000) studied
nucleosynthesis in advective discs for other parameter space
with and without the formation of shock in accretion discs.
They found that signiﬁcant nucleosynthesis can occur in the
disc and in principle this can aﬀect the metallicity of the
galaxy. If we observe a speciﬁc XRB, then this change may
become very much signiﬁcant and analysis of observational
data, ignoring these evolved abundances, can lead to very
diﬀerent results than the actual scenario. This is because,
metallicity is a key factor to determine density and other
physical parameters of the ﬂow from the spectra.

GX 13+1 and GRO J1655-40 are the two Low Mass
X-ray Binary (LMXB) sources, which exhibit the presence
of many spectroscopic lines in the wind from accretion
discs (Ueda et al. 2004, Díaz Trigo et al. 2012, Kallman
et al. 2009, Allen et al. 2018). To explain the strength of
spectroscopic lines based on one absorption zone model,
overabundance of some elements is required in comparison
with the respective solar abundances. It is very unlikely that
these overabundances are caused by either initial abundance
of the companion (Jofré et al. 2015) or nucleosynthesis
in supernova which is occurred at the time of formation
of the compact objects (Kallman et al. 2009). Hence,
the question remains: from where these overabundances
arise. We propose that these overabundances occur due to
nucleosynthesis in an advective disc and associated outﬂow,
which further leads to the enrichment of the environment
of outer Keplerian part of the disc. The observationally
inferred overabundances of Mg, Si, Ar and Cr match with
those produced in our simulation quite well. However, the
situation is really complex and theoretical calculation does
not explain the overabundances of many elements like Ca,
Ar, Mn and Co, which are also observed. Above facts also
argue that nucleosynthesis has a potential to change the
observational analysis drastically, when only Iron lines

are present in the spectra, which is actually the case for
most of the sources. Because, for those cases, to ﬁnd out
density and other physical variables of the wind as well
as disc, we need to know how much fraction Iron is of
total. Also we see in our simulation that in the inner region
of the disc, all the elements are disintegrated into free
nucleons. This can be a possible reason for spectroscopic
lines to be indiscernible when the disc is in a pure hard state.

Nucleosynthesis in the AGN disc is also attempted
to explore after developing the XRB cases. However,
quantitative comparison of abundances in our simulation
with observation for AGN is quite complex and involved
(Hamann & Ferland 1999).

However, all the earlier explorations of nucleosynthesis
in XRBs and AGNs are based on nucleosynthesis in the
disc only (Arai & Hashimoto 1992; Mukhopadhyay &
Chakrabarti 2000; Breen 2018). The nucleosynthesis in
the outﬂow was not considered self-consistently, when,
however, ﬂow cools down as it expands. The density and
temperature at the base of outﬂow are constrained by the
density and temperature of the disc. Therefore, whenever
there is an abundance evolution in the disc, there may be
some evolution in the outﬂow, contingent upon density and
temperature at the launching radius, which we consider
here. For the present purpose, we use one of the simplistic
spherically expanding adiabatic outﬂow models, which
has been used extensively to study nucleosynthesis in the
outﬂow from collapsar discs in past (Fujimoto et al. 2004;
Banerjee & Mukhopadhyay 2013b). Although Hu & Peng
(2008) studied nucleosynthesis in the spherically expanding
outﬂow from advection dominated accretion ﬂows, their
is self-similar, which, we know, diﬀers very
disc model
much from the actual solution in the inner region of the
disc. They also used the scaling relation for expansion time
(τ ) with density (ρ) as τ ∼ 446/ρ1/2 for the dynamical
evolution of outﬂow.

We consider here the magnetized advective accretion
disc solution following Mondal & Mukhopadhyay (2018)
(hereafter MM18) for the present purpose of nucleosynthesis
in XRBs and AGNs. However, the results do not diﬀer dra-
matically for any other self-consistent advective disc models.
We follow the geometry of the outﬂow to ﬁnd out the veloc-
ity of the expansion, which is more realistic with the outﬂow
picture. Finally, our result reveals that ﬁnal abundance in
outﬂow depends mostly on the velocity of the outﬂow with
which it launches, and not really on its density and tem-
perature proﬁles. Numerical general relativistic magnetohy-
drodynamic (GRMHD) simulations (McKinney & Narayan
2007; Narayan et al. 2012; S¸adowski et al. 2014) indicate us
to choose the appropriate outﬂow velocity. As shown in the
subsequent sections, if outﬂow velocity is small (∼ 0.005c or
less), then the ﬁnal abundance changes drastically from the
disc. However, if the velocity is suﬃciently high, then the ﬁ-
nal abundance remains almost same as that at the launching
radius of the disc. This argues that we should not conclude
about the elements and elemental synthesis by which outer
Keplerian part as well as surrounding environment enriched
by performing nucleosynthesis only in the disc. The outﬂow

can inﬂuence elemental synthesis and ﬁnal abundance sub-
stantially.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we
present how theoretically and computationally we perform
nucleosynthesis. We describe models of disc and outﬂow in
Section 3. In Section 4, we present the results of nucleosyn-
thesis for XRB as well as AGN cases. We have described
about the shortcomings of our model and compare our re-
sults with observation in Section 5. We justify the choice of
simplistic outﬂow model for our work in Section 6. Finally
we conclude in Section 7.

2 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

In this section, we discuss how theoretically and computa-
tionally we mimic the physical situation and how the nucle-
osynthesis is performed. First of all, we need initial abun-
dances over which reactions to occur. Choosing initial abun-
dance is a very crucial step as depending on this all the
reactions occur. However, as all the elements ﬁnally are dis-
integrated to free nucleons in the inner region of the ﬂow,
ﬁnal results will not depend critically on the initial abun-
dances unless it is drastically diﬀerent. Nevertheless, initial
abundance determines where in the disc various reactions
occur. It is useful to represent the abundances in terms of
mass fraction (X).

After choosing initial abundances for all isotopes, we
need temperature (T ), density (ρ) and velocity (v) of the
ﬂow, i.e. hydrodynamics of the ﬂow. As the plan is nucle-
osynthesis in advective disc and in outﬂow launched from
the disc, we need hydrodynamic proﬁles of advective disc
and outﬂow which we discuss in the next section. Reaction
rates are taken from JINA reaclib database1(Cyburt et al.
2010). For ﬂexibility and to use in larger network, the rate of
the i-th reaction is presented following Thielemann (1980)
as

NA < σv >i= exp[c1

i +c2

i T −1

9 +c3

i T −1/3

9

+c4

i T9+c6

i T 1/3
+ c7

9 +c5
i log(T9)],

i T 5/3
(1)

9

where NA is the Avogadro number, < σv >i is the reaction
rate per unit volume, ci-s are the Thielemann coeﬃcients,
T9 is the temperature in units of 109 K. The values of
coeﬃcients ci are given in the JINA reaclib database for
various reactions. It is clear from equation (1) that reaction
rates are highly sensitive to the temperature.

Total number of reactions in an unit time step for
a speciﬁc element depends on how many nuclei of that
element present in the system. The requirement of density
comes here. The mass fraction of each element depending
on density gives the number of nuclei of the respective
element which determines how much each element will be
destroyed/synthesized in an unit time step.

As the ﬂow is moving towards a black hole, we need
to keep track of how much time it is spending in a speciﬁc
temperature and density region. If the velocity is low,

then elements in the ﬂow will spend more and more time
around a region, more and more reactions will occur in
that region and abundance will evolve largely. Otherwise,
if the velocity is very high, then elements in the ﬂow
will spend less and less time with insigniﬁcant number of
reactions, which will keep the ﬁnal abundance similar to
the initial abundance. It has been found in our study that
this eﬀect is very crucial in determining the ﬁnal abundance.

Now brieﬂy we describe how reaction network
changes the abundance following Cooper et al. (2006).
For simplicity we assume 4 elements and 3 reactions:
1H(1H,β+ν)D(D,γ)4He(24He,γ)12C. Neglecting any back-
ward reactions, the corresponding rate equations can be ex-
pressed as

Here λ-s are the reaction rates of speciﬁc reactions, sub-
scripted by the respective main reactant. Therefore, if the
temperature, density and velocity of the ﬂow are available,
then at each time step, solving the above set of equations
using semi-implicit Euler method, we obtain the change
of abundances at that step. Then updating the initial
abundance for the next time step, which is same as the ﬁnal
abundance of the previous step, we obtain the evolution of
elements through the whole ﬂow. For the present purpose,
we consider a reaction network of 3096 isotopes of diﬀerent
elements from Hydrogen to Copernicium for XRBs and
a network of 366 isotopes from Hydrogen to Yttrium for
AGNs. We have veriﬁed that our nuclear reaction network
conserves mass to within one part in 108. This is the same
well tested nuclear network code which was implemented
by Banerjee & Mukhopadhyay (2013a,b) for studying
nucleosynthesis related to the collapsar disc.

3 DISC AND OUTFLOW MODELS

taken from MM18.
Advective disc hydrodynamics
The authors there discussed about the importance of
large scale strong magnetic ﬁeld in removal of angular
momentum, as well as the possible origin of diﬀerent
kinds of magnetic barriers in advective, geometrically
thick, sub-Keplerian accretion ﬂows around black holes.
We consider 3 diﬀerent hydrodynamic proﬁles depend-
ing on diﬀerent ﬁeld conﬁgurations, as described by
follows.
MM18. The diﬀerent

sets considered are as

Set 1: Brc = 2Bφc; Set 2: Brc = 0.5Bφc; Set 3: Brc = Bφc;
where Brc and Bφc are the magnetic ﬁelds in the radial and
azimuthal directions respectively at the critical point. It is
important to emphasis that MM18 considered the strong
ﬁeld magnetic shear in order to remove angular momentum
and subsequently accretion of matter. As the strong ﬁeld is
expected to sluggish magnetorotational instability (MRI),
the eﬀect of αvisc is expected to be sluggish too. Hence,
MM18 did not consider αvisc in their model. On the other

4 Datta & Mukhopadhyay

hand, MM18 model is vertically averaged and hence it is
unable to capture vertical motion/variation of the ﬂow (and
ﬂow variables), which is a drawback. Moreover, the vertical
component of magnetic ﬁeld was assumed to be zero. For
more details, see MM18. Many of these shortcomings were
removed by Mondal & Mukhopadhyay (2019).

As shown by Mukhopadhyay & Chatterjee (2015) for
weaker ﬁeld magnetic shear, an eﬃcient removal of an-
gular momentum via magnetic shearing stress is possible
and the ﬂow is equivalent to that governed by MRI with
0.01 (cid:46) αvisc (cid:46) 0.1, depending on how the ﬁeld varies ver-
tically. From the comparison of ﬂow proﬁles given by ear-
lier works (e.g. Mukhopadhyay & Chakrabarti 2000; Rajesh
& Mukhopadhyay 2010), we may anticipate the eﬀective
αvisc in MM18 to be (cid:38) 0.05. However, for a more accu-
rate determination of equivalent αvisc giving rise to similar
ﬂow/hydrodynamic variables as of MM18, we need to solve
disc equations, once considering shear only due to αvisc, and
then only with strong magnetic shear, and adjust the αvisc
in the former in order to produce ﬂow proﬁles very similar to
the later, as was performed by Mukhopadhyay & Chatterjee
(2015).

For the computation purpose, we use Schwarzschild
radius rs(= 2GM/c2) as the unit of length scale. The mass
of the black hole is assumed to be 10M(cid:12) for XRBs. The
hydrodynamic solutions for advective disc are obtained
by taking crudely the advection factor to 0.5, not by
considering rigorous cooling eﬀects. This factor includes
all the information of cooling and hence advection. In the
equation of state, MM18 used adiabatic index Γ ∼ 1.34,
which corresponds to the ratio of gas to total pressure β ∼
0.04. From the gas pressure, we determine temperature,
which becomes 109 − 1010K. Fig. 1 reveals the temperature,
density and velocity proﬁles as functions of distance from
the black hole (r) for the three above mentioned sets. It
is quite natural that temperature, density and velocity
increase as the ﬂow advances from outer region to the
near black hole. As the density is very low, the very high
temperature becomes the key ingredient for the evolution
of abundances of various elements.

For a supermassive black hole of mass 107M(cid:12) (i.e.
AGN), the hydrodynamic variables in accretion discs with
the same physical parameters as of XRBs remain same in
the present model, except density scaling down with M .
We therefore also explore, how only the change in mass of
central black hole does aﬀect the nucleosynthesis. Other
than the change in density, another important change is the
residence time of matter in the disc which scales as M . As
we compare below, this makes the abundance evolution in
AGNs diﬀerent than XRBs.

For outﬂow, we assume simplistic spherically expanding
adiabatic outﬂow model (Qian & Woosley 1996). Although
this model is used mainly for supernova discs (Pruet et al.
2003, Banerjee & Mukhopadhyay 2013b), for its simplistic
picture, we use the model as the possible outﬂow from XRBs
and AGNs. The adiabaticity ﬁxes the temperature evolution
as well as the entropy of the ﬂow. The temperature of the

ejecta based on this model is
(cid:18) Rej

(cid:19)3(Γ−1)

Tej(t) = T0

Rej + vejt

(3)

where Tej(t) and T0 are the temperatures at time t and
t=0 respectively. Basically T0 is the temperature of the
disc where from outﬂow launches, Rej is the corresponding
radius of the disc, vej is the ejecta (outﬂow) velocity and Γ
is the adiabatic index of the ﬂow.

The entropy of the ejecta is ﬁxed at the value given by

where TM eV is the temperature in units of MeV and ρ10 is
the density in units of 1010gm cm−3. The ﬁrst term of equa-
tion (4) is the contribution from relativistic particles, e.g. γ,
e+, e−, and last two terms represent the contribution from
nonrelativistic heavy particles. Depending on the tempera-
ture and density of the disc at a radius from where outﬂow is
ejected, the entropy becomes ﬁxed. As the volume expands,
the temperature evolves adiabatically. The density is ob-
tained from equation (4) for given S and T . Therefore, now
we need to ﬁnd out only that how the volume expands, i.e.
the velocity, for that we follow Banerjee & Mukhopadhyay
(2013b) given below. The spherical expansion corresponds
to
˙Mej = 4πr2ρvej,

From the disc hydrodynamics, we know vR and Hej at Rej.
Therefore ﬁxing the ratio ˙Mej/ ˙Macc, we obtain the ejecta
velocity. This ratio acts as a free parameter in the model.
Diﬀerent values to this ratio give diﬀerent ejecta velocities
and we study nucleosynthesis for diﬀerent ejecta velocities.
We ﬁnd that the ﬁnal abundance processing through outﬂow
depends critically on vej. A full justiﬁcation of using this
outﬂow model is discussed in Section 6.

4 NUCLEOSYNTHESIS

4.1 X-ray binary

4.1.1 Nucleosynthesis in disc

The initial abundance of accretion disc for diﬀerent isotopes
is ﬁxed as solar abundance, from Asplund et al. 2009. Some
of the most abundant nuclei of Sun are tabulated in Table
1. Due to diﬀerent temperature, density and velocity conﬁg-
urations of the disc ﬂow, the initial abundances are evolved
diﬀerently for diﬀerent sets of disc proﬁles. However, the
overall picture of disc nucleosynthesis remains same for all
the sets. Initially, in the outer region of the advective disc,
the temperature and density are so low for the Set 1 and Set

3 that no nuclear reaction takes place. As matter advances
toward inner region of the disc, the temperature as well as
density increase. Depending critically on the temperature,
reaction rates become signiﬁcant and abundances start to
evolve. In the innermost region, all the elements ﬁnally
are disintegrated to free nucleons. In the middle region of
the ﬂow, various reactions occur and abundances evolve
in such a way that many peaks and dips of evolution of
various elements occur (Fig. 2). The middle region comes
in the picture because of the chain disintegration reactions,
which eventually convert the initial elements to free nu-
cleons. This scenario helps in capturing the right region
of the accretion disc where nucleosynthesis occurs eﬃciently.

As disc hydrodynamic proﬁles for Set 1 and Set 3

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2015)

are almost similar (Fig. 1), the abundance evolutions
for these two sets (see Fig. 2) also crudely look similar.
However, for Set 2, the size of advective disc is smaller
and advective ﬂow starts from a relatively higher temper-
ature. Therefore, for Set 2, most of the heavy elements
are disintegrated at the beginning of disc nucleosynthe-
sis and very few elements remain in the disc with free
nucleons. That is why Set 2 becomes less interesting
to us. The whole picture of disc nucleosynthesis can be
viewed typically as the disc nucleosynthesis of Set 1 or Set 3.

Finally N e20 disintegrates to alpha particles through the
reaction N e20(He4)O16(He4)C 12(2He4)He4. These reac-
tions play the key role for the abundance evolution shown
in Fig. 2. Disintegration of some of the most abundant
nuclei in the disc for the proﬁles in Set 1 is shown in Fig. 3.
This picture remains almost same for Set 3.

Due to the above described chain reactions, various el-
ements produce in the disc. The underlying evolutions are
shown in Fig. 4 for Set 1 and in Fig. 5 for Set 3. All the ele-
ments are shown to diﬀer largely from the initial abundances
and cause the disc abundance to deviate from solar abun-
dance. Note that the solar abundance is usually assumed to
be granted for the analysis of observations of disc spectra.
However, spectroscopic lines are observed, when sources are
in between high/soft state (when Keplerian SSD is domi-
nant) and low/hard state (when advective disc is dominant)
(Ponti et al. 2012), whereas we perform nucleosynthesis in
the advective disc, which captures the required temperature
suitable for nucleosynthesis.

The Bernoulli parameter for an advective disc generally
remains positive (Narayan & Yi 1994), which indicates
that it is prone to outﬂow. This outﬂow is expected to be
highly responsible to enrich the outer Keplerian disc by the
newly generated nuclei. In the next section, we investigate
the nucleosynthesis in outﬂow. Note importantly that
advective disc remains dominant than Keplerian thin SSD
in a low/hard state, which is expected to lead to non solar
abundance in the disc in the low/hard state. One reason
for not observing lines in a low/hard state could be due to
the high temperature of the advective disc, when electrons
can not remain in the atomic orbit for transition. The de-
tails of observational constraint and the presence/absence
of winds in soft/hard states are discussed in the next section.

Figures 4 and 5 look almost similar, where the evolu-
tions are for Set 1 and Set 3 respectively. The noticeable
diﬀerence is, for Set 1 the evolution of isotopes leading to
peaks spans in a larger range of radius than Set 3. This
becomes clear from the hydrodynamic proﬁles for Set 1
and Set 3 (Fig. 1). In the radius range of evolution, the
temperature is larger and the velocity is smaller for Set
3 relative to Set 1, which leads to maintain the ﬂow at
higher temperature for a longer time interval for the former.
This is eventually responsible for the formation of those
nuclei shown in Figs. 4 and 5 and then again due to higher
temperature they disintegrate in the smaller range of radius
for Set 3 compared to Set 1.

4.1.2 Nucleosynthesis in outﬂow

When all the evolutions occur in the advective disc, some
matter is ejected through the outﬂow. In this section,
we discuss the nucleosynthesis in outﬂow. Finally outer
Keplerian disc as well as nature will be enriched with those
elements only, which come out from the advective disc.
Initial abundances for nucleosynthesis in the outﬂow are
the evolved abundances of the disc. Initial temperature and
density of the outﬂow, when it is launched, are constrained
by the temperature and density of the disc radius from
where it is launched. Naturally, in outﬂow, the temperature
and density decrease as it expands and goes away from the
disc.

We have already divided the advective disc in three
regions: outer region, middle region and inner region. When
the outﬂow is launched from the outer region, we ﬁnd that
no nucleosynthesis takes place therein, because temperature
is too low for nucleosynthesis, which
in the disc itself
decreases further in the outﬂow. When outﬂow is launched
from the inner region where only free nucleons and helium
nuclei survive, then also no signiﬁcant nucleosynthesis
takes place. Therefore, outﬂow from the inner region of
the disc decreases the overall metallicity of the environment.

However, when the outﬂow launches from the middle
region of the disc, signiﬁcant nucleosynthesis takes place
evolve drastically. These abundance
and abundances
evolutions are shown in Figs. 6, 7 and 8. These are some
typical abundance evolutions, when respective outﬂows are
launched from diﬀerent radii of the middle region of Set
1. However, the respective choices of launching radii are
is not
arbitrary, when for the present purpose the goal
understanding the outﬂow mechanism. As mentioned above,
initial abundances for nucleosynthesis in outﬂow are ﬁxed
by the respective disc’s abundances at the launching radius.
As in the middle region of the disc itself, abundances evolve
very fast,
initial abundances for outﬂow from diﬀerent
radii become very diﬀerent. This makes large diﬀerence
in abundance evolution of diﬀerent elements in outﬂows
launched from diﬀerent radii of the middle region. As we
see that for the outﬂow from 17rs (Fig. 6), except Si28,
abundances of all the elements decrease. For outﬂow from
19rs (Fig. 7) abundances of S34, Ca40 and T i46 increase.
However,
for outﬂow from 21rs (Fig. 8), most of the
elements shown are not only survived from the disc but

also synthesized in the outﬂow. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that
whenever outﬂow is launched from the middle region, the
ﬁnal abundances of Mg, Si, Ar, Ti and Cr remain higher
than the solar abundances signiﬁcantly in most of the cases.
For the Set 3 disc, the same scenario repeats.

4.2 AGN

To simulate the nucleosynthesis of advective discs in AGN
in reasonable time, we consider the nuclear network of 366
elements which includes up to diﬀerent isotopes of Yttrium.
The choice is justiﬁed as we notice that elements with higher
mass number are not produced signiﬁcantly in XRBs. In-
deed, we compare nucleosynthesis in XRBs with 366 nu-
clear network with that of 3096 network, shown in Fig. 9.
It shows that all the abundances match quite well for two

ments in Set 1 between XRB and AGN.

4.2.2 Nucleosynthesis in outﬂow

Like XRBs, nucleosynthesis mostly occurs in the outﬂow,
when outﬂow is launched from the middle region of the
advective disc. The abundance evolutions in outﬂow, when
it is launched from diﬀerent radii of Set 1, are shown in
Figs. 11, 12 and 13. Here in most of the cases, ﬁnal abun-
dances of Mg, Si, Ti, Cr remain higher than solar abundance.

One crucial point to note is that all the nucleosynthesis
in outﬂow depends on the outﬂow velocity which is directly
proportional to ˙Mej/ ˙Macc. Observationally, the velocity of
the outﬂow from advective disc is also not well constrained.
˙Mej/ ˙Macc = 0.1, i.e
Hence, we choose a typical value of
mass ejection rate is 10% of mass accretion rate, in most
of the computations which seems quite reasonable. How-
ever, we also compare nucleosynthesis in outﬂow with dif-
˙Mej/ ˙Macc, shown in Fig. 14. With the in-
ferent values of
˙Mej/ ˙Macc (hence, velocity of the outﬂow), nuclei
crease of
get lesser time to interact and ﬁnal abundance follows the
initial launching abundance. It is clear from Fig. 14 that
larger the ˙Mej/ ˙Macc, larger the velocity, lesser the change
in abundance. This conﬁrms that if the outﬂow velocity is
large, ﬁnal abundance will remain same as disc abundance.
However, for lower velocity of outﬂow, ﬁnal abundance can
change drastically from the disc abundance.

5 CAVEATS, OBSERVATIONAL

CONSTRAINT AND SUPPORT

There are state-of-art GRMHD simulations of black hole
accretion including advection dominated accretion ﬂow
(ADAF) and radiative transfer (e.g. McKinney & Narayan
2007; Narayan et al. 2012; S¸adowski et al. 2014), which
showed the time evolution and formation of quasisteady disc.
However, till now, to the best of our knowledge, no work
on nucleosynthesis is performed selfconsistently along with
hydrodynamic simulation. Recent venture of nucleosynthe-
sis were mostly by performing full nuclear reaction network

nuclear networks, except that we lose some information of
heavier elements which have at the most X ∼ 10−8.

4.2.1 Nucleosynthesis in disc

The abundance evolution of diﬀerent elements looks similar
but with some diﬀerences in the evolutionary pattern com-
pared to XRBs. Also interestingly, the location of middle
region where most of the nucleosynthesis taking place shifts
outward, as shown in Fig. 10. This is because the residence
time of matter increases for AGNs, hence all the disintegra-
tion and evolution of abundances occur at larger radii than
XRBs. Rest remains same.

on tracer particles in a post processing step after GRMHD
simulation (Siegel & Metzger 2017). Needless to mention,
following similar procedure for the present purpose will re-
veal more accurate results. However, throughout the whole
time span of a ﬂow and nucleosynthesis, the most contribu-
tory elemental abundances come from the quasi-steady part,
because it remains for most of the time period. That is why,
here we emphasize only steady disc hydrodynamics proﬁles,
which are indeed quite simpler to tackle without loss of im-
portant physics and handy.

Through spectroscopic lines, winds are predicted ob-
servationally only in softer states of XRBs, when jet is
quenched (Ponti et al. 2012). In most of the cases, absorp-
tion line of Iron appears when an XRB changes its state
from low/hard state (when advective disc dominates) to
softer state (when Keplerian part of disc starts to domi-
nate). There are many proposals to explain possible rea-
sons for this change. Also the detection of a weak wind in
the hard state of GRS 1915+105 (Lee et al. 2002) indicates
the possibility of ejection of signiﬁcant amount of matter in
both the soft and hard states. However, due to higher ion-
ization in the hard state, the ions become fully stripped and

wind becomes transparent and hence invisible (Díaz Trigo &
Boirin 2013). Nevertheless, Neilsen & Homan (2012), based
on transition from hard to soft states in GX-13+1, showed
that overionization can not be the only reason for invisibil-
ity of wind in a hard state. Another possible reason being
thermodynamical instability of wind for the range of proper
ionization parameter, which is suitable for the appearance
of absorption lines in a hard state (Chakravorty et al. 2013).
Ponti et al. (2012) showed the dependence of angular incli-
nation of the disc with the appearance of absorption line.
Nevertheless, the theoretical modeling is in its infancy stage
to conclude something about the invisibility of line as well
as wind in a hard state. This is a crucial constraint for our
work to say anything about the velocity of the outﬂow as
well as ﬁnal abundance in the outﬂow. However, we know
from theoretical calculation that hot advective disc is more
prone to outﬂow than cold Keplerian disc due to the pres-
ence of various additional physics in the former (Narayan
& Yi 1994; Chakrabarti 1996; Fröhlich 2003; Narayan et al.
2012; MM18).

Although the abundance evolution appears to be in-
signiﬁcant in order to observe it in the galactic scale, when
we observe a particular LMXB, the evolution can change the
observational analysis very much. From observational anal-
ysis and modeling, till now the understanding is that ther-
mally driven wind is launched from 103−104rs of a Keplerian
disc (Boirin et al. 2005; Díaz Trigo et al. 2012; Díaz Trigo
& Boirin 2013; Done et al. 2018). In most cases, highly ion-
ized Iron lines only are detected. For very few sources, many
spectroscopic lines are detected (Ueda et al. 2004; Kallman
et al. 2009; Díaz Trigo et al. 2012), and GX 13+1 is one
of such sources. Ueda et al. (2004) and Díaz Trigo et al.
(2012) reported larger [S/Fe] ratio than solar value repeat-
edly. Although Allen et al. (2018) attempted to model the
disc wind with multiple absorption zones with fewer variable
abundances, they acknowledged that complex modeling of
absorption lines using single absorber with super-solar Ca,

Ar, S, Si and Mg abundances is also a possible solution.
Other source for which many spectroscopic lines are detected
is GRO J1655-40 (Kallman et al. 2009). The authors there
reported that diﬀerent models predicted overabundances of
Cr, Mn and Co, relative to Fe, by at least 50%. They tried to
explain the abundance distribution as an eﬀect of early su-
pernova, though there are many discrepancies remain in the
abundances of Ti, V and Co. It is quite unlikely that these
overabundances of diﬀerent elements, present in the wind,
are also present in the companion star (Jofré et al. 2015).
Also we know that due to lower temperature, nucleosynthe-
sis is not possible in a Keplerian disc. Therefore, the question
remains, from where these overabundances of diﬀerent ele-
ments in comparison with solar are arising. We show that
these overabundances possibly arise due to nucleosynthesis
in the advective part of disc and corresponding outﬂow, and
enriching the atmosphere of outer Keplerian part of the disc
by evolved elements, from where the wind is launched. From
the position of underlying LMXB in the hardness-intensity
diagram (Ponti et al. 2012), we can infer that the disc is
not in a complete soft state when we observe wind. It also
contains signiﬁcant advective component, however when jet
is quenched. Moreover, observationally, it is not possible to
detect isotopic lines. Therefore, we compute total isotopic
abundances of diﬀerent elements in the disc-wind system.
Abundances of diﬀerent key elements in the disc and out-
ﬂow for ˙Mej/ ˙Macc = 0.1, when launched from diﬀerent radii,
along with respective solar values are listed in Table 2. We
ﬁnd that abundance of Fe becomes highly sub-solar when
outﬂow is launched from the inner portion of the middle
region. The possible overabundances of Mg, Si, Ar and Cr
can be easily explained by the present work. The range of
observationally predicted overabundance is also 2 − 6 times
solar abundance, which matches with our results. There is
a predicted overabundance of Ti also from our calculation,
which is not detected yet. Again observationally, the pre-
dicted overabundances of S, Ca, Mn and Co in some cases
are possibly implying the complex dynamics of disc, outﬂow
and wind which we are unable to capture yet. However, as
Iron abundance decreases, larger [S/Fe] ratio becomes possi-
ble for certain cases. We also ﬁnd that in the inner region of
the advective disc, due to higher temperature, mostly free
nucleons are there. It may also be one possible reason for
not to see spectroscopic lines in a pure hard state.

In most of the sources (Ponti et al. 2012) only Fe XXV
and Fe XXVI ionized spectroscopic lines are present. Then
to ﬁnd out the column density and other physical variables
of wind as well as disc, metallicity comes in the picture and
till now observers use solar metallicity. Actually, we need to
know how much fraction Iron is of total. If by the nucle-
osynthesis in advective disc and outﬂow, abundance of Iron
changes, which is the case in the inner region of disc, then
all the analysis will change drastically.

For AGN, the disc and outﬂow structures are more com-
plex and involved. There are many processes, specially galac-
tic chemical evolution (Hamann & Ferland 1999), which can
account for diﬀerent elemental abundances for AGN. There-
fore, the job of comparing quantitatively our nucleosynthe-
sized abundances with observational signature is quite te-
dious and even nucleosynthesis eﬀect may be insigniﬁcant
in comparison with eﬀects from other sources. Only we can
conclude that this abundance change can be important when

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2015)

we try to model cosmological abundances of galaxies at high
redshifts (Jin et al. 1989).

6 JUSTIFICATION OF OUTFLOW MODEL
AND NUCLEOSYNTHESIS THEREIN

6.1 Outﬂow model

For the present purpose, we use a very simplistic model of
outﬂow which assumes adiabaticity, spherical expansion and
constant velocity. Fixing ˙Mej/ ˙Macc = 0.1 gives outﬂow ve-
locity ∼ 103 Km/s, which is the typical wind velocity ob-
served in XRBs (Díaz Trigo & Boirin 2013). However, some
estimates also argued that the mass outﬂow rate to be of the
order of the mass accretion rate (e.g. Ueda et al. 2004, 2009;
Ponti et al. 2012). Hence, the outﬂow velocity may also in-
crease and the ﬁnal abundance in the outﬂow may remain
almost same as the disc abundance, as we discussed earlier.
Nevertheless, GRMHD simulation of magnetized advective
accretion disc (Narayan et al. 2012) showed outﬂow veloc-
ity to be varying in the range 0.001 − 0.04c for the range
of disc radius 50 − 5rs, depending on diﬀerent conﬁgura-
tions of simulation. Moreover, the authors there found that
˙Mej/ ˙Macc = 0.1 at r = 20rs. Therefore, our chosen outﬂow
velocities are quite consistent with the simulation, which
conﬁrms the robustness of ﬁnal nucleosynthesized products.

6.2 Sensitivity to temperature

Nucleosynthesis is very much sensitive to temperature and
our all the evolutions of abundances take place in a tem-
perature range (3 − 6) × 109K. Therefore, wherever this
temperature lies in the disc, the evolution of elements oc-
curs with the change in abundances in the disc. However, as
mentioned above, GRMHD simulation of magnetized advec-
tive accretion disc (Narayan et al. 2012) showed that outﬂow
could take place from a large range of radius of the whole
disc. Interestingly, the temperature range, in which nucle-
osynthesis is most sensitive, lies between two extrema: virial
temperature in a typical low/hard state and blackbody ther-
mal temperature of the Keplerian disc in a high/soft state.
Moreover, the positions of sources exhibiting wind in the
Q-diagram (Ponti et al. 2012) indicate the wind to be de-
tected in between these two states. Obviously, if the outﬂow
takes place from a radius where temperature is diﬀerent from
(3 − 6) × 109K, the nucleosynthesis in the outﬂow presented
here is less relevant. However, the position of sources with
wind in the Q-diagram and super-solar abundances of dif-
ferent elements together suggest outﬂow to take place from
the said speciﬁc region of the disc. Nevertheless, perform-
ing nucleosynthesis in post processing step after performing
threedimensional GRMHD simulation of magnetized advec-
tive accretion disc might give resolution to this confusion,
which can be explored in future.

6.3 Comparison between nuclear and outﬂow

timescales

There are numerous reactions occurring in the outﬂow. One
typical chain of reactions, which is crucial for the produc-
tion of Cr52 from F e54 is: F e54(H 1)M n53(H 1)Cr52. Now,

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2015)

Nucleosynthesis in advective disc and outﬂow

11

we take F e54(H 1)M n53 as a typical nuclear reaction in the
outﬂow. The reaction rate of this reaction at 3.5 × 109 K,
which is the typical temperature at the base of outﬂow, is
R ∼ 103s−1. Therefore, the typical nuclear time scale is
tnuc = 1/R = 0.001 s. Now most of the nucleosynthesis in
the outﬂow takes place within the distance of 2rs from the
disc and a typical velocity of outﬂow is 0.0045c. This gives
the outﬂow timescale ∼ 0.044s, which is much larger than
tnuc. This indicates that signiﬁcant nucleosynthesis could
take place in the outﬂow itself. As the temperature decreases
with distance from the disc, nuclear timescale increases and
no signiﬁcant nucleosynthesis could take place above 2rs.
The temperature at the base of the outﬂow is already con-
strained by the temperature of the disc. Therefore, for so
short distance, exact variation of temperature does not af-
fect largely the abundances, which supports our simplistic
parameterized outﬂow model.

7 CONCLUSIONS

We have performed nucleosynthesis in the advective disc
in XRBs and AGNs, and subsequently in the respective
outﬂows launched from there rigorously. Starting from solar
abundance, elements have evolved in the disc. The velocity
of outﬂow is a very key parameter in order to determine
ﬁnal abundances and till now the outﬂow velocity is not
constrained observationally. However, comparison with
outﬂow velocity from GRMHD simulation indicates that
chosen outﬂow velocity is quite reasonable. Inclusion of a
larger nuclear network does not work to synthesize heavier
elements in the accretion disc. The abundance evolution in
the outﬂow has conﬁrmed that it is very crucial to consider
nucleosynthesis in the outﬂow when its velocity is low. All
the earlier works neglected outﬂow nucleosynthesis. The
present work has shown that neglecting outﬂow nucleosyn-
thesis may severely lead to wrong conclusion about ﬁnal
abundances. In other words,
inference about abundance
evolution based on disc nucleosynthesis alone is misleading.

We have found that when outﬂow is launched from a
suitable region of the disc with ˙Mej/ ˙Macc = 0.1, ﬁnal abun-
dances of the elements Mg, Si, Ar, Ti and Cr remain super-
solar, irrespective of the exact position from where the out-
ﬂow is launched for most of the cases. In the observation of
wind from LMXBs, when many spectroscopic lines are avail-
able, people attempted to model wind with the assumption
of either one absorption zone or many absorption zones. If
we combine the latest observations, then the one zone model
requires super-solar abundance of Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn,
Co. We have proposed that these overabundances arise due
to the nucleosynthesis happening in the advective disc of
XRBs and outﬂows from there. Required overabundances of
Mg, Si, Ar and Cr and larger ratio of [S/Fe] have matched
certainly that obtained from our simulation. Rest of the
over-abundant elements indicate possibly complex dynamics
of the disc and outﬂow, and also the subtle dependence on
the velocity of outﬂow, but possibly uncaptured yet. Also
we have taken the initial abundance of the accretion disc
as solar abundance. It may vary from star to star depend-
ing on the companion. In future, we will study whether the
abundance evolution in outﬂows changes or not, if the ini-

12 Datta & Mukhopadhyay

tial abundance for nucleosynthesis in disc changes largely
depending on the diﬀerent evolutionary stages of the com-
panion.

As all the elements are disintegrated into free nucleons
in the inner region of the disc, this can be the possible reason
for invisibility of wind, i.e. spectroscopic lines, in pure hard
states. Another possible reason is that the density of the ad-
vective disc is 5 − 6 orders of magnitude less than Keplerian
disc. When an outﬂow takes place from an advective disc,
after advancing some distance it will be cooled down and nu-
clei will capture electrons, becoming eligible for producing
spectroscopic lines. However, by that time, density becomes
too low to produce any signature of absorption. Neverthe-
less, in many observations when only Iron lines are present,
these nucleosynthesized abundances have the potential to
change the whole observational analysis. Above all, ﬁnally
we can say that this nucleosynthesis argues for the modeling
of wind from accretion disc more complex and open.
