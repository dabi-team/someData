ABSTRACT

We present azimuthally averaged metal abundance proﬁles from a full, comprehensive, and conservative re-analysis of the deep (∼800
ks total net exposure) Chandra/ACIS-S observation of the Centaurus cluster core (NGC 4696). After carefully checking various
sources of systematic uncertainties, including the choice of the spectral deprojection method, assumptions about the temperature
structure of the gas, and uncertainties in the continuum modeling, we conﬁrm the existence of a central drop in the abundances of the
‘reactive’ elements Fe, Si, S, Mg, and Ca, within r (cid:46)10 kpc. The same drops are also found when analyzing the XMM-Newton/EPIC
data (∼150 ks). Adopting our most conservative approach, we ﬁnd that, unlike the central drops seen for Fe, Si, S, Mg and Ca, the
abundance of the ‘nonreactive’ element Ar is fully consistent with showing no central drop. This is further conﬁrmed by the signiﬁcant
(> 3σ) central radial increase of the Ar/Fe ratio. Our results corroborate the previously proposed ‘dust depletion scenario’ , in which
central metal abundance drops are explained by the deposition of a signiﬁcant fraction of centrally cooled reactive metals into dust
grains present in the central regions of the Centaurus cluster. This is also supported by the previous ﬁndings that the extent of the
metal abundance drops in NGC 4696 broadly coincides with the infrared dust emission.

1. Introduction

One of the most compelling ways to study the chemical evo-
lution of the universe at its largest scales is via X-ray spec-
troscopy of galaxy clusters, groups, and giant elliptical galax-
ies. Indeed, the gravitational potential wells of these systems are
deep enough to retain the major fraction of their baryons, which
consist of a hot (106–108 K), tenuous (10−1–10−5 cm−3) X-ray-
emitting plasma (for a review, see e.g., Böhringer & Werner
2010). These hot atmospheres are rich in heavy elements (C,
N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni) whose abun-
dances can be relatively well constrained from their K-shell
emission lines in the X-ray energy window (for a recent review,
see Mernier et al. 2018a).

Thanks to current X-ray observatories like Chandra and
XMM-Newton, which allow to do accurate spatial spectroscopy,
the spatial distribution of metals in the diﬀuse intracluster
medium (ICM) can be studied in detail, providing invaluable in-
formation on where, how, and when these metals – produced by
Type Ia (SNIa) and core-collapse supernovae (SNcc) – escaped
from their galaxy hosts and enriched hot atmospheres of galaxy
clusters, groups, and ellipticals. In the outskirts, the recent dis-
covery of ﬂat, uniform metal abundance proﬁles (Werner et al.
2013; Simionescu et al. 2015; Urban et al. 2017) strongly sug-
gests that the bulk of metals enriched the hot ICM before clusters
started to form and attain a well stratiﬁed entropy (i.e., typically
at z (cid:38) 2-3). This scenario is also supported by recent cosmologi-

cal hydrodynamical simulations (Biﬃ et al. 2017, 2018b; Truong
et al. 2018), suggesting that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) play
an essential role in spreading metals out of their host galaxies
before assembling into clusters (for a review, see e.g., Biﬃ et al.
2018a). In addition, it is now well established that cool-core clus-
ters1 host a centrally peaked Fe distribution while noncool-core
clusters exhibit a much ﬂatter Fe proﬁle (De Grandi et al. 2004;
Lovisari & Reiprich 2018). The central Fe excess found in cool-
core clusters was initially thought to be produced by ongoing
SNIa explosions from the low-mass stellar population within the
(red-and-dead) brightest cluster galaxies (BCG; e.g., Böhringer
et al. 2004). However, the surprising ﬁnding that SNcc products
(i.e., O, Mg, as well as a fraction of Si, S, and Ar), which are not
expected to be produced by BCGs within the last ∼7-8 Gyr, also
exhibit a central peak reopened the question of the origin of the
central enrichment in cool-core systems (Simionescu et al. 2009;
Mernier et al. 2017).

Perhaps even more intriguing is the presence of apparent
metal abundance drops in the very core (i.e., within a few kilo-
parsecs) of some relaxed systems. First discovered in the galaxy
cluster Abell 2199 (Johnstone et al. 2002), central drops were
later reported for Fe in many other sources, including also less

1 The term ‘cool-core’ is used for systems in which the cooling time
of the central ICM is typically shorter than the Hubble time (Molendi
& Pizzolato 2001; Hudson et al. 2010).

massive groups and ellipticals (e.g., Churazov et al. 2003, 2004;
Rasmussen & Ponman 2007; Raﬀerty et al. 2013; Panagoulia
et al. 2015; Mernier et al. 2017; Gendron-Marsolais et al. 2017).
Because these drops are diﬃcult to explain with simple enrich-
ment models, they were initially thought to be artefacts of spec-
tral analysis. For instance, Werner et al. (2006) showed that the
apparent drop seen in 2A 0335+096 was solely due to the over-
simpliﬁed assumption of a single-temperature plasma, as no in-
version in the Fe proﬁle is found when two or more tempera-
tures are modeled in the spectra (i.e., the so-called “Fe-bias”;
e.g., Buote 2000). In several other cases, however, assuming a
multi-temperature structure for the gas does not help to attenuate
these drops. Possible eﬀects from resonance scattering have also
been proposed, but were found to contribute to only a negligible
fraction of the apparently missing Fe (Sanders & Fabian 2006b;
Gendron-Marsolais et al. 2017). Besides Fe, central abundance
drops were also found for several other elements, in particular Si
and S (Panagoulia et al. 2015; Mernier et al. 2017).

Under the assumption that the observed metal abundance
drops are real, it has been proposed (Panagoulia et al. 2013,
2015) that a signiﬁcant fraction of metals initially residing in
the hot phase will rapidly cool down and be deposited into dust
grains, thereby becoming invisible in the X-ray band. As most
BCGs host an AGN which is able to uplift and re-heat its sur-
rounding hot atmosphere via mechanical feedback (for a recent
review, see Werner et al. 2018), metal-rich dust grains may be
dragged out of the innermost regions, possibly in the form of ex-
tended emission line ﬁlaments, before becoming re-heated and
returning into their initial hot phase a few kiloparsecs away from
the center.

A key prediction of the above scenario is that, unlike all the
metal abundances that are measurable in X-ray (i.e., ‘reactive’
elements), abundance drops are not expected to occur for Ne
and Ar, as these two elements are noble gases and are not eas-
ily deposited into dust grains (i.e., ‘non-reactive’). The current
CCD instruments do not have the required spectral resolution to
accurately constrain the Ne abundance2 and no ﬁrm conclusion
could be drawn from the central Ar proﬁles using XMM-Newton
observations of nearby cool-core systems (Mernier et al. 2017).
In addition to the moderate spatial resolution of XMM-Newton,
the main reason is that stacking data of many systems naturally
increases the intrinsic scatter of the proﬁles, especially in cool-
core systems (see also Lovisari & Reiprich 2018). Clearly, test-
ing the above scenario requires very deep observations of one
bright, carefully selected, nearby cool-core system.

The most striking example of central metal abundance drops
certainly comes from Abell 3526 (i.e., the Centaurus cluster).
The central BCG (NGC 4696) of this bright and nearby cool-
core system exhibits one of the most prominent Fe drops known
to date (with an abrupt inwards decrease from ∼2 to ∼0.5 so-
lar), which was the second ever discovered (Sanders & Fabian
2002). Since then, additional detailed observations of the Cen-
taurus cluster have further conﬁrmed this remarkable drop within
its central 5-20 kpc, not only in Fe but also in Si, S, and possibly
Mg (Sanders & Fabian 2006a; Panagoulia et al. 2013; Sanders
et al. 2016). In addition, NGC 4696 is well known to contain
signiﬁcant amounts of dust, observed in far-infrared with Spitzer

2 Unfortunately, the main Ne emission lines (Ne x and Ne xi) are lo-
cated within the Fe-L complex unresolved by CCD instruments, making
the Ne abundance strongly degenerate with other parameters, e.g., the
Fe abundance or the temperature structure of the gas. While the Reﬂec-
tion Grating Spectrometer (RGS) instrument on-board XMM-Newton is
technically able to resolve these lines, its slitless design does not allow
for spatially resolved spectroscopy.

well as extended Hα and optical (in particular [NII]) ﬁlaments
(Fabian et al. 2016; Hamer et al. 2018, see also Lakhchaura et
al. 2018).

In this paper, we take advantage of the extremely deep Chan-
dra observations of NGC 4696 (residing in the core of the Cen-
taurus cluster), obtained in successive pointings over 14 years
since the beginning of the mission, combined with the unique
spatial resolution of the telescope, in order to infer unprece-
dented constraints on its metal abundance proﬁles. Speciﬁcally,
we aim to compare the (non-reactive) Ar radial distribution with
that of the other (reactive) elements in order to test the dust de-
pletion scenario as a possible explanation of the central metal
abundance drops. In this respect, we put a strong emphasis on
the major systematic eﬀects that may alter such measurements
and possibly explain some results previously reported in the lit-
erature. This includes a careful comparison with XMM-Newton
measurements, which we also re-analyze. The data reduction and
analysis of all the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations are
described in Sect. 2. Our results are reported in Sect. 3, and are
subsequently discussed and further interpreted in Sect. 4. We
summarize our conclusions in Sect. 5. Throughout this paper, we
adopt a ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, ΩM =
0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7. The metal abundances are given with respect
to the solar values of Grevesse & Sauval (1998). Unless stated
otherwise, the errors are given within their 68.27% conﬁdence
level (1σ).

2. Data

For this work, we used all the publicly available Chandra and
XMM-Newton observations of the core of the Centaurus cluster
(NGC 4696), taken from the High-Energy Astrophysics Science
Archive Research Center (HEASARC). A log of these observa-
tions is given in Table 1.

2.1. Chandra data reduction and analysis

We used the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations
(CIAO) software version 4.9 (Fruscione et al. 2006) and CALDB
version 4.7.3 for all the data reduction, and for the spectral anal-
yses, we used the X-ray spectral ﬁtting package XSPEC version
12.9.1 (Arnaud 1996). The procedures used for the data reduc-
tion were the same as described in Lakhchaura et al. (2018).
The standard chandra_repro tool was used to reprocess the
data and strong background ﬂares were ﬁltered and removed us-
ing the lc_clean script. Once ﬁltered, the cleaned ACIS-S data
have a total exposure of 797.31 ks (Table 1). The point sources in
the ﬁeld were detected using the CIAO task wavdetect (false-
positive probability threshold=10−6), veriﬁed by visual inspec-
tion of the X-ray images and removed from the subsequent anal-
ysis.

2.1.1. Spectral extraction

Although the remarkable amount of data available for NGC 4696
allows for the spectral regions to be subdivided into multiple,
azimuthally resolved spatial bins (e.g., Sanders et al. 2016),
here we aim to optimize the number of counts available per re-
gion in order to provide the most accurate constraints or the Ar
abundance. This implies adopting radial bins that are both az-
imuthally averaged (i.e., concentric annuli instead of sectors)
and much larger than what is usually considered based on the
spatial resolution of Chandra. Therefore, spectra were extracted
from four concentric annuli (or shells, when the spectra are fur-
ther deprojected), bounded by 4.4, 11.0, 26.6, and 65.3 kpc (cor-
responding to ∼0.4, 1.0, 2.5, 6.0 arcmin, respectively; see Fig. 1)
and centered on the X-ray emission peak, using the CIAO task
specextract. The annuli selection lead to ∼0.76, 1.51, 2.61
and 3.71 million counts in the four annuli, respectively, in the
0.5–7.0 keV energy range.

The standard Chandra blank-sky background event ﬁles
matching the source observations were used to extract the back-
ground spectrum corresponding to each of the source spectra.
The blank-sky event ﬁles were reprojected to match the source
observation coordinate frame. We also scaled all the blank-
sky spectra by the ratio of the 9.5-12 keV count rates of the
source and blank-sky observations, in order to match the time-
dependent particle background levels in the source and blank-
sky observations. The diﬀerences in the Galactic foreground
level in the scaled blank-sky and source spectra, determined
using the ROSAT All Sky Survey 0.47–1.21 keV (RASS 45
band) count rates, were found to be insigniﬁcant. We note that,
whereas background issues can sometimes be appreciable when
analyzing extended X-ray sources, the exceptional brightness of
NGC 4696 makes background uncertainties largely negligible in
the present analysis.

2.1.2. Spectral ﬁtting

The gas in the central regions of Centaurus is known to be mul-
tiphase. Therefore, single-temperature plasma models cannot ﬁt
the spectra well enough in the innermost bins, and may even
cause signiﬁcant underestimation of Fe due to “Fe-bias” (Buote
2000, see also Mernier et al. 2018a). To account for the complex
multi-temperature structure of the cluster core, we successively
ﬁtted the spectra with two diﬀerent multi-temperature models,
namely a two-component vapec model (using AtomDB version
3.0.7), hereafter ‘2T vapec’, and a vgadem model, which re-
produces a normally distributed diﬀerential emission measure.

We also added an additional thermal bremsstrahlung component
with the temperature ﬁxed at 7.3 keV to account for the unre-
solved low-mass X-ray binaries in NGC 4696 (see Irwin et al.
2003). The Galactic absorption was accounted for by using the
photoelectric absorption model wabs. The neutral hydrogen col-
umn density and the redshift were kept as free parameters in all
the analyses. We veriﬁed that, within a given annulus, a slight
variation of these two best-ﬁt parameters has negligible eﬀects
(i.e., a few percent at most) on our results.

For both the 2T vapec and vgadem models, the Fe, Si, S,
Mg, Ca and Ar abundances were kept as free parameters, the
He abundance was ﬁxed to the solar value, and all other ele-
ments were tied to Fe. For the 2T vapec model, the temperatures
and normalizations of the two vapec components were kept as
free parameters while the abundances of the same elements were
tied between the two components. We also note that a single-
temperature component (vapec) was used when modeling two
components did not signiﬁcantly improve the ﬁts (which often
results in highly degenerate parameters between the two compo-
nents). For the vgadem model, the mean temperature, the width
of the temperature distribution, and the normalization were kept
as free parameters. To determine the gas density (n = ne + ni) of
the four shells (assuming spherical symmetry), a constant den-
sity was assumed in each shell, and then the densities were ob-
tained from the vapec/vgadem normalizations (η) using the fol-
lowing relation.

where DA is the angular diameter distance of the source, and ne

and np = ne/1.2), respectively.

2.2. XMM-Newton data reduction and analysis

We also compare the results obtained using the deep Chandra
data with the archival XMM-Newton observations of the Cen-
taurus core, which were taken in two separate pointings (Jan-
uary 2002 and July 2006). The data reduction was performed us-
ing the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS) v14.0.0
and follows the same procedure as presented in Mernier et al.
(2015). In summary, we process the EPIC MOS (i.e., MOS 1
and MOS 2) and pn data using the tasks emproc and epproc,
respectively, before ﬁltering them to discard ﬂared events. To do
so, the light curves in the 10–12 keV band were stacked in 100-s
binned histograms. We then ﬁtted a Gaussian to the distribution
and selected the count-rate threshold above which the events are
rejected to be µ + 2 σ. The same procedure was repeated for the
0.3-2 keV band (for 10-s binned histograms), as ﬂaring events
may aﬀect softer energies diﬀerently (Lumb et al. 2002). A sum-
mary of the cleaned XMM-Newton data (∼150 ks for the two
pointings) is also presented in Table 1.

The rest of the analysis of the XMM-Newton data follows that
described above for Chandra (Sects. 2.1.1 and 2.1.2). Speciﬁ-
cally, the EPIC spectra were extracted following the same re-
gions as shown in Fig. 1 and the excluded point sources were
selected from the ACIS-S detections. In order to account for the
larger point spread function (PSF) of XMM-Newton, the circu-
lar regions centered on the point sources were excised within
a radius of 10 arcsec (Mernier et al. 2015). For the two XMM-
Newton observations, the combined 0.5-7.0 keV counts in the
four annuli were ∼0.11, 0.25, 0.45 and 0.73 million for MOS 1;

were obtained via the SAS tasks rmfgen and arfgen, respec-
tively. The MOS 1, MOS 2, and pn spectra were all ﬁtted simul-
taneously, with all their parameters tied accordingly between the
three instruments.

3. Results

As stated in Sect. 1, we aim to carry out a comprehensive study
on the central metal abundance drops in the Centaurus cluster,
taking into account all the potential ﬁtting biases that might sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀect our measurements. In the following subsections,
we compare our radial proﬁles obtained with diﬀerent assump-
tions, namely the temperature structure of the gas, the choice of
the spectral deprojection method, the energy band within which
the spectra are ﬁtted, and the instruments used.

3.1. Projected proﬁles: ‘vgadem’ versus ‘2T vapec’ models

First, we focus on the Chandra observations of NGC 4696 as di-
rectly seen by the ACIS-S instrument, that is, projected on the
plane of the sky. As stated in Sect. 2.1.2, two types of multi-

Article number, page 4 of 12

temperature models are considered: vgadem and 2T vapec. In the
case of the 2T vapec model, a single-temperature (vapec) com-
ponent was enough to ﬁt the spectra beyond the two innermost
annuli. The projected proﬁles of temperature (i.e., the mean tem-
perature for vgadem and the higher temperature for 2T vapec),
total number density, Fe, Si, S, Mg, Ca, and Ar abundances, and
the Ar/Fe ratio, obtained using these two models successively,
are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 (red and blue ﬁlled areas).

Globally, these proﬁles seem to be very similar, and do not
depend strongly on the choice of the multi-temperature model.
We note, however, that the density is systematically higher in
the 2T vapec (by typically ∼30%) than in the vgadem case. As
expected, it clearly appears that, no matter which model is con-
sidered, the Fe, Si, S and Mg proﬁles show a central decrease at
r (cid:46)10 kpc. Drops are also reported for Ar and Ca, although only
at r (cid:46)4 kpc. However, the Ar/Fe ratio (Fig. 2, bottom right panel)
seems to be increasing towards the center and the increase in the
innermost bin, as compared to the outermost bin, is > 3σ and
> 2σ when using the 2T vapec and the vgadem models, respec-
tively.

3.2. Deprojected proﬁles

Projection of X-ray emission along the line of sight can blur out
actual variations in the temperature and metal-abundance distri-
bution, and can sometimes also create artiﬁcial features. In order
to get rid of these eﬀects and investigate the drops as accurately
as possible, it may be essential to deproject the spectra. As the
ﬁrst step, we deprojected the annular spectral regions using the
dsdeproj tool developed by Russell et al. (2008). The method is
based on the assumption of spherical symmetry, which is rea-
sonable for the Centaurus cluster (see also Sect. 4.1). The depro-
jected spectra were analyzed in the same manner as described
above for the projected proﬁles (see Sect. 3.1). The results for
the radial distributions of temperature, total number density, the
Fe, Si, S, Mg, Ca and Ar abundances, and the Ar/Fe abundance
ratio obtained using the two models are shown in Fig. 2 (red and
blue data points) and Table 2. In the 2T vapec model, we ﬁnd
that only the innermost shell requires two components; the three
outer shells can be reasonably ﬁtted with a single-temperature
component (vapec). This result is not surprising, as the apparent
multi-temperature nature of the ICM due to projection eﬀects is
expected to be strongly reduced after deprojection.

Compared to their projected counterparts, the deprojected
proﬁles modeled with the 2T vapec and vgadem models show
very similar trends. We note, however, that the deprojected Fe,
Si, S and Mg drops are somewhat more pronounced when using
the 2T vapec model. This may be explained by the fact that the
shape of the unresolved Fe-L complex is rather sensitive to the
assumed temperature structure. A change in the Fe abundance
can, in turn, aﬀect the abundance of the elements that are close
to the Fe-L complex. The agreement found between our pro-
jected and deprojected proﬁles in the outermost annuli/shells is
not surprising, as the latter are weakly aﬀected by the deprojec-
tion methods. On the contrary, the largest diﬀerences are to be
expected in the inner regions, where projection eﬀects are more
important. In fact, the Fe drop (spanning over the three innermost
bins) appears much more signiﬁcant in the deprojected proﬁles,
in particular when the 2T vapec model is assumed. In addition,
the Ar/Fe ratio also increases towards the center, with the same
signiﬁcance as in the projected proﬁles.

Since we have demonstrated that the choice of the partic-
ular multi-temperature model does not dramatically aﬀect the
shape of the metal abundance drops (in particular for Ar, i.e.,
our main element of interest), in the following we choose to use
the vgadem model, both for its simplicity (one less free param-
eter than the 2T vapec model) and realism (a continuous multi-
temperature distribution seems more plausible than only two dis-
tinct, independent gas phases). Moreover, the weaker Ar/Fe gra-
dient reported in Fig. 2 for the vgadem model makes our results
more conservative.

The two deprojection methods yield rather similar metal
abundance proﬁle slopes. We note, however, that using projct
brings the value of the maximum abundance for Ca to better
agreement with the ∼10 kpc extent of the Fe, Si, S and Mg drops.
Furthermore, we ﬁnd signiﬁcantly higher abundances when us-
ing the projct method. While this source of uncertainties has no
impact for the purpose of this study, we caution that it may be
more critical if one wants to constrain the integrated abundances
or abundance ratios of some speciﬁc elements in the ICM (e.g.,
Simionescu et al. 2018; Mernier et al. 2018b). Since projct in-
volves a simultaneous ﬁt of all the projected spectra, the derived
uncertainties are higher for projct than for dsdeproj. Therefore,
although the magnitude of the drops in the best-ﬁt values of the
metal abundances are larger for projct than for dsdeproj, the sig-
niﬁcance of the drops is still higher for dsdeproj (41σ vs. 30σ
for Fe). The inter-dependency of the shell parameters in projct is
also known to produce potentially unstable measurements (Rus-
sell et al. 2008). However, the two deprojection techniques use
diﬀerent but equally valid approaches and the diﬀerences in the
obtained results are likely to reﬂect the level of systematic uncer-
tainties. For this reason, we show the results obtained with both
methods. Because the implementation of dsdeproj allows us to
perform narrow band ﬁts (see Sect. 3.4) more easily, we decided
to use dsdproj as our reference deprojection method.

3.3. Comparison with XMM-Newton

In addition to comparing the results between dsdeproj and pro-
jct, Table 2 and Fig. 3 also compare the above Chandra/ACIS-
S (density, temperature, metal abundance and Ar/Fe ratio) pro-
ﬁles to the ones obtained with XMM-Newton/EPIC (red and blue
ﬁlled areas).

We ﬁnd that, globally, the XMM-Newton results are consis-
tent (diﬀerence < 3σ) with their corresponding Chandra coun-
terparts. The agreement is also in line with the analysis of Schel-
lenberger et al. (2015), who found that the temperatures mea-
sured by ACIS and EPIC tend to converge when the gas is cooler.
We note, however, a slight but signiﬁcant tension between the
two data sets in some speciﬁc cases – in particular in the sec-
ond outermost shell when using projct. We speculate that these
discrepancies may be due to a combination of remaining calibra-
tion issues and artifacts propagated when projct is used. Never-
theless, in both cases the deprojected EPIC spectra clearly reveal
the presence of central drops for the Fe, Si, S, Mg and Ca abun-
dances.

Despite the formal consistency reported above, we note that
the uncertainties of the XMM-Newton abundances of Ar and Ca
are much larger than the uncertainties of the Chandra measure-
ments. This point is discussed in more detail in Sect. 3.4.

Deprojection methods

To test the sensitivity of our results to diﬀerent approaches to
spectral deprojection, we compared our present approach (ds-
deproj) with measurements obtained using the projct model in
XSPEC. In the former method, for each shell the contributions
of all the outer shells are subtracted and then each of the result-
ing deprojected spectra is ﬁtted individually. The latter method
involves forward ﬁtting and the projected spectra of all the shells
are ﬁtted simultaneously to obtain the deprojected parameters. A
comparison of the resulting proﬁles obtained using dsdeproj and
projct is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3 (red and blue data points).

3.4. Broad-band versus narrow-band ﬁts

Whereas ﬁtting the spectra using the full energy band (i.e., typ-
ically ∼0.5-7 keV for Chandra ACIS) is the standard procedure
for deriving the best-ﬁt parameters, this approach may bias the
metal abundance measurements. In fact, since the abundance of
a given element is directly proportional to the equivalent width
of its line (namely, the ratio between the total line ﬂux and the
continuum ﬂux at the centroid energy of the line), incorrect de-
termination of the continuum in the vicinity of the line would
lead to incorrect measurement of the corresponding elemental
abundance. Because no instrument is calibrated with inﬁnite pre-
cision, some slight imperfections of the eﬀective area may pro-

duce these local over- or underestimates of the continuum. In
the case of very deep observations, that is, when statistical un-
certainties become smaller than the above systematic eﬀect, such
a bias may become highly signiﬁcant (e.g., Mernier et al. 2015;
Simionescu et al. 2018).

A good way to minimize such biases is to reﬁt the spectra
between several local energy bands, each of them including the
K-shell emission line(s) used to derive the abundance of a given
element as well as part of the surrounding continuum. In these
‘narrow-band’ ﬁts (by contrast to the above ‘broad-band’ ap-
proach), the only parameters that were kept free were the (local)
normalization and the abundance of the considered element. All
the other parameters were ﬁxed to the best-ﬁt value of the broad-
band ﬁt. A comparison of the resulting narrow-band ﬁt proﬁles
with the ones obtained using broad-band ﬁts (assuming a vga-
dem model and using dsdeproj) is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4.
We used the 1.5-2.8 keV energy range for Si and S, 2.9-3.5 keV
for Ar, 3.3-4.3 keV for Ca, and 5.0-7.0 keV for Fe.

The narrow-band Fe proﬁle in Fig. 4 is consistent with the
broad-band proﬁle and also shows a drop in the innermost two
bins (at r (cid:46)10 kpc). The narrow-band ﬁt results in larger sta-
tistical uncertainties on the Fe abundance, because it only in-
cludes the Fe-K lines and excludes the Fe-L complex. Despite
the larger error bars on the measurements, the Fe drop in the
narrow-band case is signiﬁcant at the > 8σ level. Similarly to
the broad-band proﬁles, the narrow-band proﬁles of Si, S, and
Ca also show signiﬁcant central drops (at the ∼ 41, 16, and 6σ
levels, respectively). Importantly, the narrow-band abundances
of all the elements other than Fe are signiﬁcantly higher than
their broad-band values, especially in the innermost two bins.
This indicates an overestimation of the continuum emission in
the ∼1.5-5 keV range when the spectra are ﬁtted over the entire
0.5-7 keV band.

Interestingly, the Ar abundance proﬁle determined using
narrow-band ﬁts (Fig. 4, bottom left), diﬀers even more from
the corresponding broad-band results than the other proﬁles re-

ported above. As reported in Sect. 3.2, the broad-band Ar proﬁle
shows a 2σ hint of a drop in the innermost bin, while the highest
Ar value peaks between 4 and 27 kpc. However, the continuum
around the Ar line in the innermost bin was found to be slightly
overestimated. We also conﬁrm the overestimation of the contin-
uum using projct. After applying the narrow-band ﬁt correction,
the centrally decreasing behavior of Ar completely disappears
and becomes either ﬂat or increasing towards the center. Perhaps
even more importantly, the central increase of the Ar/Fe ratio 3
reported earlier is now strongly enhanced (> 3σ comparing the
innermost two bins; > 6σ when comparing the innermost and
outermost bins; Fig. 4, bottom right).

3 In the Ar/Fe proﬁle shown in Fig. 4, we choose to adopt the Fe values
from their broad-band measurements because the Fe-L complex pro-
vides additional constraints while not deviating signiﬁcantly from the
narrow-band values. We note that, when adopting the narrow-band Fe
values in the Ar/Fe proﬁle, the central increase remains ﬁrmly detected.

Given the rather deep (∼150 ks) XMM-Newton observations
that are available, and motivated by our previous comparison in
Sect. 3.3, we also attempted to perform narrow-band ﬁts in the
deprojected XMM-Newton spectra. Regrettably, very few addi-
tional constraints could be obtained for Ar, Ca, and Fe using
that approach (see also Sect. 3.3). In fact, the limited number of
counts for each of the EPIC instruments, coupled with the spec-
tral grouping requirements of dsdeproj, make narrow-band ﬁts of
their deprojected spectra around the Ar line very diﬃcult. This
is illustrated further in Fig. 5, where beyond ∼2 keV the com-
bined deprojected spectra of ACIS-S is better resolved than the
combined deprojected spectra of EPIC MOS 1, MOS 2, and pn.
In theory, better constraints from the XMM-Newton data would
be possible if the three EPIC spectra were stacked instead of
being ﬁtted simultaneously; however this method is not advised
as it may introduce unexpected uncertainties from the combined
response and eﬀective area.

4. Discussion

4.1. Systematic uncertainties and limitations of the analysis

As demonstrated throughout this paper, a careful analysis of the
spectra is extremely important for accurately measuring metal
abundances and their distribution. Indeed, if the spectra are ﬁt-
ted using overly simplistic assumptions, the subsequent incorrect
determination of the metal abundance proﬁles can easily pro-
duce artiﬁcial trends or, on the contrary, wipe out actual features.
From our analyses, we report that the following factors can sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀect the measurements of the metal abundance drops:

– Temperature distribution eﬀects: An incorrect modeling of
the thermal structure of the ICM can simultaneously aﬀect
the continuum emission and the modeling of the mostly unre-
solved spectral lines. This naturally results in incorrect abun-
dance determinations. One of the best examples is the Fe bias
which leads to an underestimated Fe abundance when using
a single-temperature model to describe a multi-temperature
plasma (Buote 2000, see also Mernier et al. 2018a). As
shown by Werner et al. (2006), this Fe bias can easily cre-
ate artiﬁcial Fe drops in some cases. In addition, our present
analysis shows that even the choice of the multi-temperature
model can alter the shape of the abundance drops (see e.g.,
the Fe drop in Fig. 2). This eﬀect is nevertheless less impor-
tant than the Fe bias.

Article number, page 8 of 12

– Projection eﬀects: Projection along the line of sight, espe-
cially in systems with strong temperature gradients, can lead
to the mixing of the emission of the cooler gas in the cluster
center with the emission of the hotter ICM at larger radii. The
projected view of the central low-metallicity gas overlapping
with the higher-metallicity outer layers will essentially result
in overestimation of the abundances in the central regions.
These projection eﬀects can explain the relatively weaker
central drops seen in the projected as compared to the depro-
jected proﬁles (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3, diﬀerent depro-
jection techniques result in proﬁles with consistent shapes,
but may add some extra uncertainties to the measurements
of the absolute abundance values.

– Continuum eﬀects: We found that the abundances of weak
lines can be signiﬁcantly over-/underestimated, even by a
slightly incorrect modeling of the local continuum level (see
Sect. 3.4 and Fig. 4). As explained in Sect. 3.4, the best way
to deal with this eﬀect is to ﬁt these lines individually, within
narrow energy bands. In the case of Ar, this eﬀect is signif-
icant and clearly aﬀects the interpretations and conclusions
of the present study (see also Sect. 4.2). Therefore, we cau-
tion that narrow-band ﬁts should be systematically consid-
ered when one aims to measure accurate abundances from
very deep observations of X-ray bright clusters.
In our case, the Fe abundances measured with only the K-
shell transitions are formally consistent with those measured
using the full energy band. We note, however, that in the
central cooler regions of the ICM, Fe abundances are often
derived from the Fe-L complex, which is very sensitive to
the modeling uncertainties of the temperature structure of
the plasma. A possible mismatch between broad-band and

narrow-band derived Fe abundances in other systems may
thus reveal a more complicated temperature structure than
initially assumed.

– Instrumental calibration, data quality, and detector PSF: Be-
cause no X-ray mission is perfectly calibrated, comparing
measurements done with the same analysis methods using
two or more instruments is strongly recommended for very
deep data. For instance, it is well known that XMM-Newton
and Chandra do not measure the same X-ray temperatures

(Schellenberger et al. 2015). In the Centaurus cluster, we
show that these two telescopes sometimes provide slight but
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in metal abundances as well. Finally,
although these eﬀects should be limited in our analysis, we
note that the spatial resolution of the instrument can also play
an important role as a broader PSF can smooth out gradients.

Considering the above factors, we argue that the depro-
jected narrow-band analysis presented in Sect. 3.4, ﬁtted with the

Fig. 5. A comparison of the deprojected Chandra (blue) and the XMM-Newton MOS1 (black), MOS2 (red), and PN (green) spectra of the innermost
shell; the most important emission lines have been marked. The Chandra spectrum has been scaled up by a factor of ﬁve for viewing purposes.
The inset shows the zoomed-in spectra around the Ar line. It can be seen that a slight over/underestimation of the continuum in the broad-band ﬁt
can lead to an under/overestimation of the abundances, especially for the weak lines. It is also clearly seen that the XMM-Newton spectra around
the high-energy lines (Ar, Ca and Fe-K) are very noisy and are not as resolved as in the Chandra spectrum and therefore the XMM-Newton spectra
are not found suitable for the narrow-band analyses.

Gaussian-shaped multi-temperature model vgadem, and based
on the Chandra data (i.e., taking advantage of its unprecedented
PSF of ∼0.5"), provides the most reliable measurements to date
of the central abundance drops – especially when emission lines
are weak. We note however, that some limitations still remain
and could be resolved only with future missions and instruments:

– As the ICM becomes more multi-temperature when ap-
proaching the cluster center, it is not clear how the metal
abundances should be associated with the diﬀerent ther-
mal components. With the current spectral resolution of
CCDs, assuming diﬀerent abundances for two or more in-
dividual (single-temperature) components would consider-
ably increase the degeneracy between parameters. Determin-
ing how complex abundance distributions would aﬀect the
central drops requires comprehensive high-resolution simu-
lations that need to be analyzed using mock spectra (for an
example of simulated clusters investigated via mock XMM-
Newton data, see e.g., Rasia et al. 2008).

– While in our analysis we have tried two simpliﬁed assump-
tions to model the multi-temperature plasma (i.e., the 2T
vapec and the vgadem models), the actual emission might be
diﬀerent from both these assumptions, and might even have
an asymmetric emission measure distribution. Determining
the real temperature distribution in the ICM is far from trivial
– even when the spectral resolution is considerably improved
(Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2018) – and probably requires a
very good spatial resolution as well.

– All deprojection methods rely on the assumption of spher-
ical symmetry. Based on the relatively regular morphology
of the X-ray emission of the Centaurus cluster, this seems
to be a reasonable assumption and the observed modest de-
partures from spherical symmetry are unlikely to aﬀect our
conclusions.

More generally, the careful successive checks performed in
the present study have shown that the presence of drops in metal
abundance is strongly established. It is also important to note
that, since for these very deep data sets the systematic uncer-
tainties dominate over the statistical ones, adding more Chan-
dra and/or XMM-Newton exposures in the future is not expected
to signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of the present measure-
ments. While observations with future instruments will be abso-
lutely necessary for this purpose, we speculate that all the limi-
tations discussed above would somewhat aﬀect the magnitude of
the metal abundance drops, but are not expected to signiﬁcantly
change our conclusions.

4.2. The origin of the metal abundance drops

Using the best data that are available to date for the Centaurus
cluster, our comprehensive analysis conﬁrms the central drops
seen in the abundances of the reactive elements Fe, Si, S, Mg
and Ca, with a much greater signiﬁcance than obtained pre-
viously (see Sanders & Fabian 2002, 2006a; Panagoulia et al.
2013; Sanders et al. 2016). After adopting our preferred analysis
approach (i.e., vgadem multi-temperature model, ACIS-S spec-
tra deprojected using dsdeproj, and abundances ﬁtted individu-
ally within a narrow-band), we have checked carefully that these
drops do not disappear when assuming a departure from these
assumptions. Using narrow-band ﬁts, the Fe, Si, S and Mg drops
are seen inside a region of ∼10 kpc from the center. For these
elements, the spatial extent of the drops is broadly consistent
with Panagoulia et al. (2013). It is also interesting to note that
the inner region, where the bulk of the central metals is missing,
overlaps remarkably well with the dust emission region seen by
Mittal et al. (2011) (see also Fig. 1). However, the Ar abundance
is fully consistent with no drop at the center. Instead, the de-
projected narrow-band ﬁts (Fig. 4) show a monotonic centrally

increasing trend for Ar. More importantly, even taking all the
above systematic uncertainties into account, we always see a sig-
niﬁcant increase in the Ar/Fe ratio towards the center (at least
> 2σ from ∼60 kpc to ∼2 kpc).

As discussed in Sect. 1, the radial distribution of Ar across
the location of the Fe drop constitutes a crucial prediction of
the dust-depletion model in the central ICM, as proposed by
Panagoulia et al. (2013, 2015). Together with the observed sig-
niﬁcant central drops in the abundances of reactive elements Fe,
Si, S, Mg and Ca, the peaked proﬁle seen in the central region
for a noble gas like Ar, and the central increase of the Ar/Fe
abundance ratio, strongly suggest that a signiﬁcant fraction of
the cooled reactive metals is indeed getting deposited into the
dust grains present in the central regions of the Centaurus clus-
ter.

Qualitatively, our observations seem thus to indicate that
metal abundance drops are real and form via the above chan-
nel. As explained in Sect. 1, the drops may also become more
pronounced due to mechanical feedback from the central AGN
which can uplift the metal-rich dust grains out of the central re-
gions towards outer hotter regions, where they get re-heated and
start emitting in the X-ray band again.

Another open question is the mismatch in the spatial extent
of the abundance drops (e.g., Fig. 4) and the spatial extent of
the dust emission observed in the far-infrared (Fig. 1). While the
metal abundance drops typically extend out to ∼10 kpc (possibly
somewhat further; e.g., Panagoulia et al. 2013), the dust emission
is only seen within ∼4 kpc, that is, it is entirely contained within
our innermost spectral extraction region. It is possible, however,
that a signiﬁcant amount of dust resides outside ∼4 kpc, where
its associated infrared emission is too weak to be ﬁrmly detected
with Herschel and Spitzer. Another possibility is that most of
the dust uplifted by the AGN activity to radii between ∼10 kpc
and ∼27 kpc is destroyed by the interaction with the ICM. In
that case, the metal abundance peak, observed in the third shell,
is due to the excess of metals that have freshly returned to the
ICM.

Finally, we note that the presence of a central Ar drop would
not necessarily rule out the existence of a depletion of the cen-
tral ICM-phase metals and their incorporation into dust grains.
As long as the Ar/Fe abundance ratio is constantly increasing to-
wards the cluster core, dust could play a signiﬁcant role in low-
ering the central ICM abundances.

5. Summary

In this study, we performed detailed, projected and deprojected
spectral analyses of very deep Chandra and XMM-Newton X-
ray observations of the Centaurus cluster. We also investigated
the various factors that could bias the metal abundance measure-
ments. These factors include an incorrect modeling of the tem-
perature distribution of the plasma, projection along the line of
sight, uncertainties in the modeling of the local continuum (es-
pecially when weak emission lines are ﬁtted over a broad energy
band), poor data quality, as well as detector PSF and calibration.
When adopting our most conservative approach, taking most
of these systematic eﬀects into account, we conﬁrm the central
drops seen in the abundance proﬁles of the reactive elements
such as, Fe, Si, S, Mg and Ca, with a > 6σ conﬁdence. For
Fe, Si, S, and Mg, the drops are seen at r ∼ 10 kpc, while for
Ca, a signiﬁcant drop is seen only at r ∼ 4 kpc. The region of
these metal abundance drops therefore broadly coincides with
the central dust emission. Additionally, we ﬁnd a centrally in-
creasing/ﬂattening trend in the abundance of the noble gas Ar,

further conﬁrmed by a signiﬁcant increase in the Ar/Fe ratio to-
wards the innermost region of the cluster. These results consti-
tute strong observational support in favor of the scenario pro-
posed by Panagoulia et al. (2013, 2015) in which the drops in
central metal abundance are due to the incorporation of a signif-
icant fraction of the cooling reactive elements into dust grains,
leading to their disappearance from the X-ray band.
