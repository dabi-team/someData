This  work  investigated  the  vorticity  dynamics  and  stability  of  leading-edge  vortices  (LEVs)  in 
revolving  wings.  Previous  studies  suggested that  Coriolis  acceleration  and  spanwise  flow  both 
played  key  roles  in  stabilizing  the  LEV;  however,  the  exact  mechanism  remains  unclear.  The 
current study examined a mechanism that relates the effects of Coriolis acceleration, spanwise 
flow, and the tilting of the planetary vortex on limiting the growth of the LEV. Specifically, this 
mechanism  states  that  a  vertical  gradient  in  spanwise  flow  can  create  a  vertical  gradient  in 
Coriolis acceleration, which will in turn produce oppositely-signed vorticity within the LEV. This 
gradient of Coriolis acceleration corresponds to the spanwise (radial) component of planetary 
vortex  tilting  (PVTr)  that  reorients  the  planetary  vortex  into  the  spanwise  direction  therefore 
creating  oppositely-signed  LEV  vorticity.  Using  an  in-house,  immersed-boundary-method  flow 
solver,  this  mechanism  was  investigated  alongside  the  other  vorticity  dynamics  for  revolving 
wings of varying aspect ratio (𝐴𝑅 = 3, 5, and 7) and Reynolds number (𝑅𝑒 = 110, and 1400). 
Analyses  of  vorticity  dynamics  showed  that  the  PVTr  consistently  produced  oppositely-signed 
vorticity for all values of 𝐴𝑅 and Re investigated, although other three-dimensional phenomena 
play a similar but more dominant role when 𝑅𝑒  =  1400. In addition, the relative strength of the 
PVTr increased with increasing 𝐴𝑅 due to a decrease in the magnitude of advection. Finally, the 
effects of 𝐴𝑅 and 𝑅𝑒 on the vorticity dynamics and LEV stability were also investigated. 

1. Introduction 

One  of  the  most  critical  aerodynamic  mechanisms  that  enable  insect  flight  is  the  lift 
augmentation from leading-edge vortices (LEVs), which also exist in revolving wings operating at

high  angles  of  attack  (Usherwood  &  Ellington  2002;  Poelma  et  al.  2006;  Lentink  et  al.  2009). 
Despite  the  variations  in  their  integrity  (Lentink  &  Dickinson  2009b;  Jones  et  al.  2016)  and 
secondary structures (Lu et al. 2006, 2007; Lu & Shen 2008; Harbig et al. 2013b; Garmann et al. 
2013; Garmann & Visbal 2014), the primary LEV structure on insect wings does not grow into 
instability and remains attached to the wing (Lentink & Dickinson 2009a,b; Harbig et al. 2013b). 
Notably, the stability and attachment of the vortex structure are sustained not only transiently 
during the revolving period of the flapping wings (delayed stall), but also for wings undergoing 
continuous  unidirectional  rotation.  These  flow  phenomena,  presumably  manifesting  from  the 
three-dimensional flow effects unique to revolving wings, are fundamentally different from those 
generated by their translating counterparts, which normally stall at high angles of attack. 

Recently,  a  number  of  studies  have  carefully  examined  the  vortex  structure  and  the 
corresponding vortex dynamics of revolving wings (Lentink & Dickinson 2009a,b; Kim & Gharib 
2010; Cheng et al. 2013; Harbig et al. 2013b; Garmann & Visbal 2014; Wolfinger & Rockwell 2014; 
Carr et al. 2015; Jardin & David 2015; Jardin 2017; Smith et al. 2017) often with the goal of testing 
one of the four hypotheses related to LEV stability. 

Arguably, the most well-known hypothesis has been proposed by Ellington et al. (1996) and 
has been further investigated by Birch & Dickinson (2001). It states that the spanwise flow in the 
region above the wing transports the LEV vorticity towards the tip, which is then shed within a 
coherent  structure  connecting  the  LEV  and  tip  vortex  (TiV).  According  to  this  hypothesis,  the 
vorticity  transport  caused  by  spanwise  flow  is  the  main  contributor  to  balancing  the  vorticity 
transported from the leading-edge.  However, several studies that analyse the vorticity transport 
using either experiments (Cheng et al. 2013; Wojcik & Buchholz 2014) or simulations (Shyy & Liu 
2007; Aono et al. 2008) question this hypothesis; as they find no direct evidence of significant 
vorticity transport caused by spanwise flow. Nonetheless, Garmann & Visbal (2014) observe a 
reduced degree of LEV stability caused by weakened spanwise flow. Additionally, Jardin & David 
(2014) by comparing flows with externally added spanwise gradients and flows over revolving 
wings,  observe  that  a  spanwise  gradient  in  flow  speed,  viscous  effects,  and  Coriolis  and 
centrifugal acceleration all contribute to LEV attachment. However, they conclude that ultimately 
the Coriolis and centrifugal effects play the primary role in lift generation. 

The second hypothesis put forth by Lentink & Dickinson (2009b) relates the stability of the 
LEV to the effects of Coriolis and centrifugal accelerations, arguing that both play a vital role in 
LEV attachment and are key mechanisms in the generation of additional lift (Jardin & David 2015; 
Jardin 2017). This hypothesis is based on observations of the distribution of wing aspect ratio in 
natural flyers (Chin & Lentink 2016; Lentink & Dickinson 2009a) as well as their investigations of 
Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in a relative rotating frame and experiments using dynamically-
scaled robotic wings (Lentink & Dickinson 2009b; Kruyt et al. 2015). Both Coriolis and centrifugal 
accelerations  are  inversely-proportional  to  Rossby  number  (𝑅𝑜)  (Lentink  &  Dickinson  2009a), 
which  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  advective  and  Coriolis  accelerations  (Kundu  et  al.  2008). 
According to Lentink & Dickinson (2009b), wings in nature on average have wing tip 𝑅𝑜 between

3  and  4  (Chin  &  Lentink  2016;  Lentink  &  Dickinson  2009a),  leading  them  to  conclude  that 
sufficiently low 𝑅𝑜 and therefore a high Coriolis acceleration is necessary for LEV stability. It is 
important to note that in Lentink & Dickinson (2009b), the 𝑅𝑜 is equivalent to the 𝐴𝑅 used here. 
Jardin & David (2015) further show that artificially removing the Coriolis acceleration reduces 
both  the  stability  of  the  LEV  and  the  lift  because  the  Coriolis  acceleration  plays  a  role  in 
maintaining the proximity of the LEV to the wing surface. Jardin (2017) observes at 𝑅𝑒 > 200 
that Coriolis acceleration is the primary contributor to LEV attachment, while at 𝑅𝑒 < 200 the 
viscous effects dominate, and that centrifugal effects were negligible. Nonetheless, although the 
𝑅𝑜  and  therefore  the  relative  magnitude  of  Coriolis  acceleration  are  strong  indicators  of  LEV 
stability, the Coriolis acceleration per se, as pointed out by Garmann & Visbal (2014), is unlikely 
to be a direct contributor to LEV stability since it points away from the wing, which may result in 
LEV detachment. Therefore, the exact mechanism of Coriolis acceleration in stabilizing the LEV, 
if it exists, remains unclear. 

Finally,  the  two  remaining  hypotheses  argue  that  either  vortex  annihilation  due  to 
interactions  with  a  shear  layer  that  develops  between  the  LEV  and  wing  surface  (Wojcik  & 
Buchholz 2014; Panah et al. 2015; Akkala & Buchholz 2017; Onoue & Breuer 2017) or vorticity 
transport caused by downwash being generated by the tip vortex (Birch & Dickinson 2001; Lauder 
2001; Ozen & Rockwell 2012; Carr et al. 2013) are the primary source of LEV stability. Onoue & 
Breuer (2017) also conclude that vorticity annihilation is a dominant mechanism in regulating the 
growth of the LEV more so than the spanwise advection for a sweeping flat plate at 𝑅𝑒 ≈ 𝒪(105). 
Wojcik  &  Buchholz  (2014)  and  Panah  et  al.  (2015)  observe  that  the  flux  of  oppositely  signed 
vorticity generated at the wing surface is an important factor in controlling the strength of the 
LEV. In addition, Cheng et al. (2013) shows that there exists a significant downward advection of 
radial vorticity by downwash, which plays a key role in the vorticity dynamics. 

This work establishes and tests a previously undiscussed mechanism that combines the roles 
of the Coriolis acceleration and the spanwise flow in contributing to LEV stability. It provides a 
new perspective towards the roles of spanwise flow instead of its vorticity transport, which is 
found  negligible  in  previous  studies  (see  above).  Specifically,  this  mechanism  states  that  the 
vertical gradient in spanwise flow (blue, figure 1) leads to a vertical gradient in the streamwise 
Coriolis  acceleration  (green,  figure  1),  which  results  in  angular  acceleration  that  is  oriented 
opposite to the rotation of the LEV vorticity (purple, figure 1). Therefore, it creates oppositely-
signed LEV vorticity and contributes to its stability. Previous experimental work by Cheng et al. 
(2013) shows a clear negative vertical gradient of the spanwise velocity field in the region of the 
LEV (i.e., the magnitude of the radial velocity increases with decreasing height above the wing), 
which has motivated the authors to test this mechanism. In the vorticity equation, which is the 
curl of the N-S equations (Batchelor 2000; Kundu et al. 2008), this mechanism is equivalent to 
the  tilting  of  the  planetary  vortex  into  the  outboard  (root  to  tip)  radial  direction  due  to  the 
vertical  gradient  of  the  spanwise  velocity.  Note  that  the  planetary  vortex  is  tangent  to  the 
rotation axis of the wing and exists everywhere in the relative rotating frame. This tilting of the 
planetary vortex, which we name radial planetary vortex tilting (PVTr), can be shown to be equal

to the curl of the Coriolis acceleration. Therefore, the PVTr introduces oppositely-signed vorticity 
to the LEV, and contributes to preventing the LEV from growing unstable and shedding from the 
leading-edge. The PVTr is also expected to act opposite to the LEV vorticity regardless of the wing 
𝐴𝑅 or 𝑅𝑒, as long as a vertical gradient of spanwise flow exists in the region of the LEV. Therefore, 
in this mechanism, it is the curl (or vertical gradient) of Coriolis acceleration due to the gradient 
of spanwise flow that contributes to the stability the LEV, instead of the Coriolis acceleration or 
spanwise flow themselves. In this work, based on the velocity and vorticity data obtained using 
an in-house immersed-boundary-method flow solver we examine this mechanism by considering 
the role of PVTr in the vorticity dynamics of revolving wings of different 𝐴𝑅 (3, 5, and 7) and 𝑅𝑒 
(110, and 1400). 

2. Materials and Methods 

2.1 Numerical Methods 

This work simulated six cases of revolving wings where each wing starts impulsively and then 
rotates at a constant angular velocity Ω for three full revolutions about a vertical axis aligned with 
the wing root at the mid-chord location (figure 2a). The rotation angle measured from the initial 
position is denoted by 𝜃. All wings have rectangular shape with a constant chord length c = 1 cm, 
angle  of attack  𝛼 =  45°,  and  infinitesimal thickness.  The  six  cases  were  defined according  to 
three aspect ratios 𝐴𝑅 = 𝑠/𝑐 of 3, 5, and 7 and two Reynolds numbers 𝑅𝑒 = Ω𝑟𝑔𝑐 𝜈⁄  of 110 and 
1400; where s is the wingspan length, 𝑟𝑔 is wing radius of gyration, and 𝜈 is the kinematic viscosity 
of the fluid. The radius of gyration 𝑟𝑔 was defined according to (Ellington 1984) (2.1). The two 𝑅𝑒

al.  2004;  Lentink  &  Dickinson 2009b;  Harbig  et  al.  2013b)  and  house  flies  (Musca  domestica), 
respectively (Lentink & Dickinson 2009b; Harbig et al. 2013b). The kinematic viscosity used in the 
simulations was 8.0 cSt.

For  the purpose  of data  analysis,  in addition to a  fixed  Cartesian  frame (X,  Y,  Z)  a  rotated 
Cartesian frame (t, y, r) was defined based on the azimuthal angle 𝜙 of a fluid element (see figure 
2b),  identical  to  those  used  in  Cheng  et  al.  (2013).  Vectors  in  the  fixed  Cartesian  frame  were 
transformed into the rotated Cartesian frame using the Jacobian matrix 𝑱(𝜙).

where 𝐑 is the position vector of a fluid element measured from the intersection of the origin 
and the axis of rotation. 

A  Cartesian  computational  grid  with  a  stretching  grid  configuration  was  employed  in  the 
simulations, as shown in figure 2c. A grid spacing of 0.034c was used in the dense region for each 
of the three 𝐴𝑅 values, which was sufficient to resolve the near-field vortex structures around 
the  wing.  A  homogeneous  Neumann  boundary  condition  in  pressure  is  applied  to  all  six 
boundaries  of  the  computational  domain  so  that  the  vorticity  could  advect  freely  at  the 
boundaries and a no-slip boundary condition was applied at the wing surface.

Here, 𝐮 is the velocity vector in the inertial reference frame (not from a perspective moving at

included in the N-S equations solved here. An in-house, finite-difference-based, Cartesian-grid, 
immersed-boundary-method  solver  (Mittal  et  al.  2008)  was  employed  to  solve  the  above 
equations. In this solver, the flow simulation with complex moving boundaries was achieved with 
stationary non-body-conformal Cartesian grids to eliminate the need for a complex re-meshing 
algorithm, which was otherwise used by body-conformal methods. The solver can simulate flows

of  moving  bodies  with  intricate  geometry  while  still  achieving  second-order  accuracy  in  both 
space and time. The equations were integrated in time using the fractional step method, and the 
boundary conditions on the immersed boundary were enforced by a ghost-cell procedure. This 
approach was successfully applied to the flapping propulsion of insects (Liu et al. 2016; Li & Dong 
2017), birds (Ren et al. 2016), and fish (Liu et al. 2015, 2017). A detailed description and validation 
of this solver can be found in the authors’ previous work (Dong et al. 2006; Li & Dong 2017). 

A convergence test was performed using the lift coefficient data for four separate mesh sizes 
at an 𝐴𝑅  =  5, and 𝑅𝑒  =  1400. These four mesh sizes were 3.3 million nodes (225 x 65 x 255), 
6.8  million  (289  x  81  x  289),  11.6  million  (353  x  93  x  353),  and  20  million  (337  x  113  x  337), 
respectively. Notice that the lift coefficient (𝐶𝐿) was approximately the same between 11.6 and 
20 million nodes (see figure 3a). There was negligible difference between the 11.6 and 20 mesh 
in the first and fourth revolution (see figure 3b). This indicates that the simulation had converged 
and that an 11.6 million node mesh size could be used at lower computational cost. 

The aerodynamic forces acting on the wings are computed by the direct integration of the 
pressure and shear on the surfaces (Mittal et al. 2008). The lift force in particular is normalized 

as the lift coefficient 𝐶𝐿 = 𝐹𝐿/
positive).

2.2 Analysis of Vorticity Dynamics 

To  reveal  the  effects  of  the  PVTr  (i.e.,  planetary  vortex  tilting  or  the  curl  of  Coriolis 
acceleration  in  the  radial  direction)  on  the  vorticity  dynamics,  the  flow  data  were  cast  into  a 
relative rotating reference frame and used to evaluate the components of the relative vorticity 
equation. The relative vorticity equation (2.5) was arrived at by taking the curl of equation 2.4a 
and casting it into the relative rotating frame. The details of the derivation are provided in Kundu 
et al. (2008) and Cheng et al. (2013).

Note that there is no planetary vortex tilting term (2𝛀 ⋅ ∇)𝐮′ in the vorticity equation in the 
inertial frame (Kundu et al. 2008; Cheng et al. 2013). This tilting term is identical to the curl of 
the Coriolis acceleration from the relative N-S equations, that is (2𝛀 ⋅ ∇)𝐮′ = −∇ × (2𝛀 × 𝐮′). 
In a relative rotating frame, the planetary vortex is equivalent to twice the angular velocity of the 
rotating body, that is ∇ × (𝛀 × 𝐑) = 2𝛀 and the relative vorticity 𝝎′ = 𝝎 − 2𝛀 (𝝎 being the 
vorticity  in the  inertial  vorticity  equation)  (Kundu et al.  2008;  Pedlosky 2013).  For  the  current

analysis, the planetary vortex was everywhere aligned with the axis of rotation of the wing (figure 
1). Note that, in addition to the PVTr, there also exists the tilting of relative vorticity 𝝎′. 

Since  the  LEV  vorticity  is  aligned  with  the  radial  direction,  the  analysis  below  focused 

exclusively on the radial component of the relative vorticity equation.

(2.6) 

The time derivative of radial vorticity (W) was evaluated indirectly using the sum of the terms on 
the RHS of 2.6. The spatial derivatives were calculated using a second-order, central-differencing 
scheme. 

The first term on the RHS of  2.6 is the radial vorticity advection (𝐴), which represents the 
transport  of  radial  vorticity  caused  by  the  velocity  field  𝐮′.  It  can  be  decomposed  into  three 
contributions representing the advection along tangential, vertical, and radial directions:

The second term (2.8a) represents the combined effect of tilting (𝑇) and stretching (𝑆) of relative 
vorticity in the relative rotating frame. This is decomposed into the tilting (2.8b) and stretching 
of the relative vorticity (2.8c):

The  tilting  represents  the  vorticity  reoriented  from  the  other  two  directions  into  the  radial 
direction  by  the  gradients  of  radial  flow  in  either  the  tangential  or  vertical  direction.  The 
stretching corresponds to the elongation of radially-oriented vortex tubes by the radial gradients 
of radial flow. 

The  third  term  on  the  RHS  equation  of  2.6  is  the  radial  planetary  vortex  tilting  or  PVTr, 
represented  here  as  𝑃,  which  is  simply  the  radial  component  of  the  planetary  vortex 
tilting/stretching described above. Note that the PVTr scales with the vertical gradient of radial

The last term on the RHS of equation 2.6 is the diffusion or dissipation of radial vorticity (𝐷),

Previous experimental results (Cheng et al. 2013) showed that the negative radial vorticity 
comprising the LEV was continually generated at the leading-edge and advected tangentially into 
the wake region as the wing rotated. The vorticity was further advected downward into the wake 
by vertical flow, where there exists considerable stretching and tilting that reduces LEV vorticity. 
The vorticity transport due to the spanwise flow, however, was found to be negligible.  

A  normalization  scheme  was  then  applied  using  the  following  characteristic  values:  the 
, the vorticity by the magnitude 

velocity by the speed of the wing at its radius of gyration 𝐮∗ =

, and the length by the wing chord length ∇∗= 𝑐∇. Rather than 
of the planetary vortex 𝝎∗ =
using an independent vorticity scale, Lentink & Dickinison (2009a) derived theirs from a reference 
velocity 𝐮+ =

alternative  to  the  first  normalization  scheme  by  Lentink  &  Dickinison  (2009a).  Normalized

The ′ used for relative quantities was dropped from here onwards. Both sets of normalization

(2.11b) and 𝐴+ (2.11c) as functions of the 𝑅𝑜 for fixed 𝑅𝑒 (defined in §2.1). These relationships 
were arrived at by noting that with a constant 𝑅𝑒, the angular velocity Ω scales inversely with the 
𝑅𝑜.

Assuming that 𝑃∗, 𝐴∗, and 𝐴+ scale with 𝒪(1), the above normalization schemes indicate that 
with a constant 𝑅𝑒, that the dimensional PVTr (P) is inversely proportional to 𝑅𝑜 (2.11a), while 
the  dimensional  advection  (𝐴)  is  inversely  proportional  to  𝑅𝑜  (2.11b)  or  independent  of  𝑅𝑜 
(2.11c) depending on the vorticity scale chosen. The relative effect of the PVTr can be further 
revealed  by  calculating  the  ratio  of  the  advection  with  PVTr.  Using  the  two  normalization 
schemes, we have:

Under the assumption that both the normalized ratios scale with  𝒪(1), it is clear that the 
ratio A/P scales with 𝑅𝑜0 (2.13a), or with 𝑅𝑜1 (2.13b). Therefore, we make the prediction that 
the ratio A/P will scale with 𝑅𝑜𝑛, where 𝑛 = 0 or 1. To test this prediction and to understand the 
dependency of PVTr on 𝑅𝑜 the value of n will be estimated based on the data from the numerical 
simulation for both 𝑅𝑒 (see §3.3):

2.3 Averaging Processes 

To investigate the vorticity dynamics of the LEV during the quasi-steady period, two averages 
of the terms in equation 2.6 were taken. These are the time-average (denoted by   ̅ ) and the 
spatial-averages (denoted by   ̂ , and   ̃  for the area, and volume-averages respectively). The 
time-average was calculated first, and then used to calculate the spatial-averages. Both averages 
were calculated within LEV control-volumes over the second half of the third revolution because 
the flow had reached an approximately quasi-steady state (see §3.1). The LEV control-volumes 
∗̅̅̅̅ = −3, 
were  identified  using  a  threshold  of  the  normalized  time-averaged  radial  vorticity  𝜔𝑟
which was chosen instead of the more common Q-criterion (Jeong & Hussain 1995; Harbig et al. 
2013a,b; Cheng et al. 2013;  Garmann & Visbal 2014; Jardin & David 2015) or vorticity magnitude 
(Mao & Jianghao 2004; Cheng et al. 2013; Bos et al. 2013) because only radial vorticity dynamics 
were being considered. Other values were tested but they did not have any measurable effect 
on the results.

11 

The  process  for  calculating  the  time-average  essentially  collapsed  all  of  the  LEV  control-
volumes from each time-step onto a single wing location (in this case the original position of the 
wing)  (figure  S1a),  and  corrected  the  misalignment  of  the  resulting  grids  (figure  S1c).  The 
correction process identified all the vorticity equation data on the misaligned grid (rotated by an 
angle 𝜙) within a small radius 𝛿 = 0.8√(Δ𝑥)2 + (Δ𝑧)2 centered at each point on the original grid 
and  averaged them  together  returning this new adjusted  value to the  original  grid.  From this 
point, all of this corrected data was averaged together to produce a time-averaged LEV control-
volume (figure S1b,d). 

Once the time-average was calculated, it was used to determine the spatial-averages for each 
𝑅𝑒 and 𝐴𝑅. First, the area-averages were calculated along surfaces defined by the intersections 
of a set of cylindrical slices with radii equal to the 𝑅𝑜(𝑟) centered and aligned with the rotation 
axis and the interior of the time-averaged LEV (figure S1e). The number of cylindrical slices used 
were 21, 41, and 31 for 𝐴𝑅 = 3, 5 and 7 respectively. All of the vorticity equation data within a 
small tolerance of each slice were averaged together to calculate the area-average at each 𝑅𝑜(𝑟). 
The volume-averages were then calculated as the average of the area-averages. 

Due to the infinitesimal thickness of the wing, most of the vorticity is produced at or very 
near the leading-edge of the wing. Consequently, large gradients in the velocity field exist in the 
regions  close  to  the  leading-edge.  In  these  regions,  finite  differencing  is  subject  to  higher 
truncation errors because of the limited resolution of the grid or mesh in the CFD simulation, and 
this could lead to numerical diffusion of vorticity. This “false” numerical diffusion effect occurs 
because the  local  streamlines  of  the flow  are not  aligned  with  the  local  computational  mesh. 
While numerical diffusion can be reduced by higher-order, finite-difference schemes and/or by 
more  finely  resolved  meshes,  the  alignment  issue  remains  since  streamline  geometry  is  not 
known in advance when generating the mesh. For a more detailed discussion about numerical 
diffusion, see (Patankar 1980). The effects of these errors can be seen by calculating the sum of 
the terms on the RHS of equation 𝑊∗̂  2.6, which was expected to be close to zero after time and 
spatial  averaging  because  the  flow  had  reached  quasi-steady  state  within  the  time-averaging 
period. However, this was not the case as is observed in figures S3a and S4a. The time and area-
average of the time derivative of vorticity is not zero initially after taking the time-average. This 
"false" numerical diffusion can lead to errors in calculating the terms in equation 2.6 and can be 
reduced by using higher-order, finite-difference schemes and/or by more finely resolved meshes 
near the leading-edge. These methods are difficult to implement due to the nature of in-house 
CFD code used. Instead, a leading-edge cylinder (LEC blue) and tip cylinder (TC red) was used to 
isolate certain problematic points in the mesh and remove them from the time-averaged LEV 
control-volume (figure S2). No cylinders were used for the root or trailing edges since the LEV 
control-volume does not cover those parts of the wing. The result of using a LEC and TC is shown 
in  figures  S3b-d,  and  S4b-d.  After  applying  the  LEC,  the  time  derivative  became  roughly  zero 
everywhere as expected, although there are higher deviations when 𝑅𝑒 = 1400.

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1 Vortex Structure and Lift Coefficient 

In this work, the vorticity dynamics of revolving wings were analysed only when the flow field 
(and therefore the LEV) had reached an approximately quasi-steady state in the relative rotating 
frame. The quasi-steady state was identified by first observing the temporal behaviours of 𝐶𝐿 and 
the vortex structure over the first three revolutions. Figure 4a shows these temporal variations 
of 𝐶𝐿 for all six cases with different 𝐴𝑅 and 𝑅𝑒 and figure 4b shows the time-averaged values in 
the second half of the first and third revolution, respectively. In all six cases, there was a transient 
period  for  approximately  the  first  90°  of  rotation  before  𝐶𝐿  plateaued  in  the  rest  of  the  first 
revolution, after which all the curves had a similar stepwise decreasing behaviour. Within the 
first and third revolutions, the time-averaged 𝐶𝐿 increased with increasing  𝑅𝑒, and decreased 
with increasing 𝐴𝑅 (figure 4b). Based on the trend of 𝐶𝐿 (figure 4a) it is determined that the flow 
field has reached a quasi-steady state by the second half of the third revolution, which was the 
main time-period of our analysis. 

Figure 5 shows iso-surfaces of normalized, and time-averaged radial vorticity. When 𝑅𝑒  =
 110,  the  vortex  structures  were  smoother  and  subject  to  smaller  temporal  variations  when 
compared with the cases where 𝑅𝑒  =  1400. The LEV was comprised of negative radial vorticity 
and is conical in shape over the wing surface, extending past the trailing edge for the 𝐴𝑅 =  5, 
and 7 cases. The LEV sheds into a TiV near the tip and extended into the wake aligned with the 
positive tangential direction.

3.2 Local Behaviour and Effects of the PVTr 

The PVTr represents the effect of the Coriolis acceleration in the vorticity dynamics (2.6) as 
discussed in §2.2. The PVTr is directly proportional to the vertical gradient of the radial velocity 
(2.9). Earlier we predicted that the PVTr acted functionally as a source of radial vorticity opposite 
to that of the LEV by tilting the planetary vortex line into the radial direction. This mechanism 
was examined using the area-averages of PVTr within the LEV control-volume for all six cases. 

Figure 6 shows the area-averaged values of the PVTr 𝑃 (2.9) along with the advection 𝐴 (2.7), 
tilting 𝑇 (2.8b), stretching 𝑆 (2.8c), and diffusion 𝐷 (2.10) as they vary with 𝑅𝑜(𝑟). It was observed 
that the PVTr was consistently positive for the entire length of the wing. Since the PVTr is always 
positive, it is generating oppositely-signed radial LEV vorticity, and therefore acts to reduce the 
LEV circulation for all 𝑅𝑒 and 𝐴𝑅 tested. For the 𝑅𝑒  =  110 cases, the strongest positive term

positive  across  all  𝐴𝑅  and  𝑅𝑒  for  the  majority  of  the  wing-span.  When  𝑅𝑒 = 110  the  PVTr  and  the 
advection both scale with the 𝑅𝑜(𝑟) up to one chord length from the tip. When 𝑅𝑒 = 1400, the tilting 
now exceeds the PVTr and scales roughly with the advection.

over the majority of the wing-span was the PVTr. In contrast, when 𝑅𝑒 = 1400, the PVTr was the 
second strongest positive term following the vortex tilting except when 𝐴𝑅 = 7 where the PVTr 
and tilting had similar magnitudes. Therefore, the stabilizing effect of the PVTr at 𝑅𝑒 = 1400 is 
weaker  relative  to  it's  effect  at  𝑅𝑒 = 110  because  the  tilting  plays  an  additional  role  in  LEV 
stabilization  (see  §3.5).  Additionally,  the  PVTr  exhibited  a  roughly  linear  behaviour  up  until 
approximately  1-2  chord  lengths  from  the  tip  where  it  reached  the  spanwise  location  of 
maximum PVTr for all 𝑅𝑒 and 𝐴𝑅 tested, which was identified as 𝑅𝑜(𝑟𝑁) = arg max(𝑃∗̂). The 
values  of  max(𝑃∗̂)  and  𝐴𝑅 − 𝑅𝑜(𝑟𝑁)  are  provided  in  table  1.  For  all  𝐴𝑅  and  𝑅𝑒  tested,  the 
maximum PVTr varied between approximately 1.5 and 2.5. This indicates that the magnitude of

the wing-span. 

the PVTr does not change substantially with the changes in 𝐴𝑅 or 𝑅𝑒 and functions as a consistent 
mechanism contributing to LEV stability. 

The primary term from the vorticity equation (2.6) that leads to the growth and instability of 
the LEV was the vorticity advection (2.7). As the wing rotated, the tangential flow that passed 
over the leading-edge transports negative radial vorticity generated at the fluid-surface interface 
into the LEV. Therefore to further understand the relative stabilizing effect of the PVTr, the ratio 
of the advection to the PVTr using area-averages 𝜉∗ = |𝐴∗̂/𝑃∗̂| was calculated (see  2.11b and 
§2.3). A plot of 𝜉∗ vs. 𝑅𝑜(𝑟) is given in figure 7 for each 𝐴𝑅 and 𝑅𝑒 tested. In general, 𝜉∗ remained 
approximately constant at values of 𝒪(1) across the wing-span when 𝑅𝑒  =  110, indicating that 
the  relative  effect  of  PVTr  in  the  vorticity  dynamics  remains  consistent  along  the  wing-span 
(except  the  region  close  to  the  tip).  In  the  cases  of  𝑅𝑒  =  1400  however,  𝜉∗  exhibited  large 
variations along the wing-span and the effect of PVTr was less dominant both locally and globally. 
Presumably, the onset of turbulence in the 𝑅𝑒 = 1400 leads to large spatial variations in the flow 
velocity, which significantly increases the variability in the vorticity advection (figures 6d-f). 

3.3 Global Behaviour and Effects of 𝑨𝑹 and 𝑹𝒆 on the PVTr and Vorticity 
Advection 

The effect of the PVTr on the entire LEV control-volume was determined by considering the 
normalized  volume-averages  of  PVTr  for  each  case  (figure  8a).  In  this  section,  the  volume-
averaged PVTr 𝑃∗̃ was first plotted against different 𝐴𝑅 for 𝑅𝑒 = 110 and 1400 (figure 8a). With 
the  volume-averaged  advection  𝐴∗̃,  the  ratio  between  the  advection  and  PVTr  Ξ∗ = |𝐴∗̃/𝑃∗̃|

PVTr  is  observed  to  remain  approximately  constant  across  all  AR  and  Re  at  values.  b)  Global  ratio  of

advection to PVTr Ξ∗ plotted against 𝐴𝑅 for 𝑅𝑒 = 110 and 1400. A factor of  (𝑠 𝑟𝑔⁄  )
 is used to scale back 
Ξ∗ to vary with the 𝑅𝑜 as in equation Ξ∗. The global ratio exhibits a hyperbolic decrease as shown by the 
curve fits, and decreases with increasing 𝑅𝑒. 

(figure  8b)  was  then  calculated,  similar  to  how  𝜉∗  was  calculated  for  the  local  PVTr  𝑃∗̂  and 
advection 𝐴∗̂ (see §3.2). 

The volume-averaged PVTr remained approximately 𝒪(1) for all of the 𝐴𝑅 and 𝑅𝑒 tested. 
This was similar to what was observed regarding the magnitude of the area-averaged PVTr 𝑃∗̂ in 
§3.2.  This  further  evidences  that  the  PVTr  consistently  generates  oppositely-signed  vorticity 
within the entire LEV control-volume and therefore plays a key role in the stability of the LEV. 

The stabilizing effect of the PVTr in the entire LEV was further quantified using the ratio of 
the volume-averages of advection and PVTr, Ξ∗ = |𝐴∗̃/𝑃∗̃| (see §2.3). The volume-averaged ratio 
Ξ∗  showed  a  relatively  consistent  behaviour  with  the  𝐴𝑅  across  both  𝑅𝑒  values.  That  is,  Ξ∗ 
decreased with increasing 𝐴𝑅 i.e. n < 0 where n is the exponent in equation 2.14 (see figure 8b). 
Furthermore,  Ξ∗  also  dropped  in  magnitude  with  increasing  𝑅𝑒.  Due  to  the  hyperbolic 
dependency on 𝐴𝑅 (or 𝑅𝑜 since 𝐴𝑅 scales with 𝑅𝑜) predicted by the normalization analysis, the 
dependency of Ξ∗ with 𝐴𝑅 was modeled using a hyperbolic fit for both values of 𝑅𝑒 with the 𝐴𝑅 
as the independent variable (3.1). 

Ξ∗(𝑅𝑜) = 𝑎𝑅𝑜𝑛 

(3.1) 

The values for a, and n as well as a measure of the accuracy of the fit are provided in table 2. 
Since n < 0, neither of the two normalization schemes, which predicted n = 0 or 1, successfully 
predict  the  dependency  of  Ξ∗  with  𝑅𝑜.  This  failure  could  result  from  the  scaling  of  either 
advection or PVTr being inappropriate. However, since the magnitude of the non-dimensional 
PVTr 𝑃∗̃ is of 𝒪(1) (see figure 8a), the failure must lie with the non-dimensional advection 𝐴∗̃. 
Due to the small parameter space of 𝐴𝑅 and 𝑅𝑒 involved in this study, it is unclear what the cause

of  this  failure  in  the  advection  might  be.  In  future  work,  a  widened  parameter  space,  and 
decoupling the 𝑅𝑜 and 𝑅𝑒 (Harbig et al. 2013b) might be able to help realize this fundamental 
relationship between the advection, PVTr, 𝑅𝑜, and 𝑅𝑒. 

3.4 The Relationship of Coriolis acceleration, PVTr, and LEV Vorticity 

This  section  provides  further  evidence  regarding  the  underlying  physics  of  the  PVTr  by 
examining  the  relationships  among  radial  flow,  Coriolis  acceleration,  PVTr,  and  radial  (LEV) 
vorticity. This was accomplished by analyzing the flow data along vertical lines at the middle of 
the wing-span (𝑅𝑜(𝑟) = 2.5) for the 𝐴𝑅 = 5 and 𝑅𝑒 = 110 case. Here it is shown that the peak 
in the PVTr directly coincides with the peak of the LEV vorticity. 

The Coriolis acceleration, non-dimensionalized by the magnitude of the planetary vortex and 

the velocity at the radius of gyration, is given by equation 3.2:

Figure  9a  shows  the  time-averaged  non-dimensional  tangential  Coriolis  acceleration  𝐶𝑡
radial velocity, and the gray highlighted region represents the region of the LEV defined using the 
non-dimensional radial vorticity in figure 9b. There exists a negative gradient in the radial velocity 
in the region of the LEV, and therefore a positive gradient of tangential Coriolis acceleration along 
the  vertical  direction.  The  positive  gradient  of  tangential  Coriolis  acceleration  would  create 
angular  acceleration  of  the  fluid  particles  (along  the  positive  radial  direction)  opposite  to  the 
direction  of  LEV  vorticity  and  therefore  reduce  its  strength.  Since  the  PVTr  is  identical  to  the 
vertical gradient of Coriolis acceleration (2.9), it produces oppositely-signed vorticity to the LEV 
(figure 9b). Figure 9b shows that the PVTr acts in the opposite direction of LEV vorticity, therefore 
contributing to limiting its growth. 

3.5 Local Vorticity Dynamics 

The  local  behaviours  of  other  terms  in  the  vorticity  equation  in  addition  to  the  PVTr  are 
discussed  here,  according  to  their  area-averages.  For  the  𝑅𝑒  =  110  cases  (figure  6a-c),  the 
advection (blue) was negative for the entire length of the wing, and increased linearly along the 
wing-span until approximately one chord length from the tip (or 𝑅𝑜(𝑟) = 𝐴𝑅 − 1), although this 
was  more  apparent  for  the  𝐴𝑅 = 5  and  7  cases  (figure  6b-c).  The  sign  of  the  advection  was 
expected,  since  the  advection  works  as  a  primary  source  of  LEV  vorticity  (negative  radial 
vorticity). The linear behavior in the advection can be explained by considering that locally, the 
angular velocity is constant, and therefore the non-dimensional advection scales with 𝑅𝑜(𝑟). This 
comports with the decreasing slope of the advection curves with increasing 𝐴𝑅 since for a fixed 
𝑅𝑒 the angular velocity also decreases. Finally, the abrupt change in the linear behavior of the 
advection close to the wing tip is likely due to the presence of a TiV. In the TiV, the radial vorticity 
is being tilted predominantly into the tangential direction. Unlike the advection, the tilting  𝑇∗̂ 
(red)  and  stretching  𝑆∗̂  (yellow)  started  out  at  approximately  zero  and  remain  approximately 
constant for the majority of the wing-span at 𝑅𝑒 = 110, where both increased slightly within the 
tip region before decreasing again (figure 6b-c). Since their values were approximately zero for 
the majority of the wing-span, it is likely that they do not play a significant role in the stability of 
the LEV outside of the tip region at this 𝑅𝑒. Finally, for 𝑅𝑒 = 110, the diffusion \widehat{D^*} 
(green) was approximately constant for the entire wing-span, but with a higher variability over 
time  (with  larger  error  bars).  Additionally,  the  diffusion  was  the  second  largest  positive  term 
immediately following the PVTr, and therefore is not negligible in the vorticity dynamics. Note 
that, Jardin (2017) showed that the role of the diffusion in LEV stability becomes significant for 
𝑅𝑒 < 200. Together these results suggest that when 𝑅𝑒 = 110, the diffusion and the PVTr are 
both stronger contributors to LEV stability. 

 
 
The role of planetary vortex tilting on the stability of the leading-edge vortex 

19 

At 𝑅𝑒  =  1400, the advection was still negative, and had significantly higher nonlinearity and 
variability  (see  figure  6d-f)  especially  at  higher  𝐴𝑅.  This  suggests  that  the  linear  behaviour 
observed in the advection is 𝑅𝑒 dependent. A minimum exists at approximately the mid-span 
location for the 𝐴𝑅 = 3 and 5 cases, but for the 𝐴𝑅 = 7 case no such trend exists. The tilting 
roughly  mirrored  the  advection,  having  one or more peaks  coinciding with the  minima  of the 
advection for 𝐴𝑅 = 3, and 5 and significantly dropping in magnitude for 𝐴𝑅 = 7. This behaviour 
suggests that at higher 𝑅𝑒 the tilting becomes a stronger contributor to LEV stability that balances 
the advection, especially at 𝐴𝑅 = 3, and 5 when the magnitude of tilting is significantly greater 
than that of the PVTr. The stretching was consistently negative and at its lowest point was of the 
same order of magnitude of the minimum advection. This suggests that at 𝑅𝑒 = 1400 it has a 
similar role as advection and tends to destabilize the LEV. Finally, the diffusion continues to be 
roughly constant along the entire wing-span, but was now much lower than all the other terms 
and  therefore  does  not  contribute  significantly  to  the  stability  of  the  LEV  at  a  𝑅𝑒 = 1400. 
Together, these results suggest that although the PVTr remains at about the same magnitude 
across all 𝐴𝑅 and 𝑅𝑒, again confirming it is a consistent mechanism contributing to LEV stability, 
its relative contribution to LEV stability seems to be 𝑅𝑒 and 𝐴𝑅 dependent due to the different 
behaviors of advection, tilting and stretching and vorticity dynamics. 

3.6 Global Vorticity Dynamics 

Figure 10 and table 3 show the volume-average data for each of the terms on the RHS of 
equation 2.6. The values are presented as a bar graph in figure 10 to compare the six cases. When 
𝑅𝑒  =  110, the advection had the strongest magnitude and decreased with increasing 𝐴𝑅. Both 
the tilting and stretching were approximately negligible compared to the other terms at this 𝑅𝑒, 
although the stretching was slightly larger than the tilting. The PVTr, as was discussed earlier, was 
the  largest  positive  term  and  remained  approximately  constant  across  all  𝐴𝑅  and  𝑅𝑒.  The 
diffusion  was  less  than  the  PVTr,  and  approximately  negligible  for  𝐴𝑅  =  3,  and  7  but  is 
approximately half the size of the PVTr when 𝐴𝑅  =  5. When 𝑅𝑒 increases to 1400, the advection 
behaved  similarly  to  the  𝑅𝑒  =  110  cases,  decreasing  with  increasing  𝐴𝑅  but  slightly  in 
magnitude. The tilting, on the other hand, increased significantly and was approximately equal 
to  the  PVTr  when  𝐴𝑅 = 5.  Similarly,  the  stretching  also  increased  in  magnitude  but  is  now 
negative for all 𝐴𝑅. The magnitude of the stretching approaches a similar value as the advection 
when 𝐴𝑅  =  5. The effects of tilting and stretching on the LEV stability, as they become more 
dominant at 𝑅𝑒 = 1400, remain to be studied further in the future work. Finally, the diffusion 
became negligible when 𝑅𝑒  =  1400 just as the tilting and stretching were when 𝑅𝑒  =  110.

The  tilting,  stretching,  and  diffusion  are  for  the  most  part  negligible at  𝑅𝑒  =  110  except  for  𝐴𝑅 = 5 
where  the  diffusion  exceeds  both  the  tilting  and  the  stretching.  At  𝑅𝑒  =  1400,  the  tilting  is 
approximately equal to the PVTr at 𝐴𝑅 = 5. The stretching changes sign when 𝑅𝑒  =  1400, and exceeds 
the magnitude of the PVTr at 𝐴𝑅 = 5. The diffusion remains positive but is mostly negligible at  𝑅𝑒  =
 1400.

4. Conclusions 

This work investigated the local and global vorticity dynamics within the LEV by simulating 
the flow over six revolving wings with 𝐴𝑅  =  3, 5, and 7 and 𝑅𝑒 at the radius of gyration of 110 
and 1400, respectively, using an in-house, finite-difference-based, immersed-boundary-method 
solver. The data within the LEV control-volume were time-averaged over the second half of the 
third revolution after identifying that the flow had reached a quasi-steady state. We observed 
that  the  radial  component  of  the  curl  of  the  Coriolis  acceleration,  or  the  PVTr,  provided  a 
relatively consistent stabilizing effect against the vorticity advection regardless of the value of 
𝐴𝑅  or  𝑅𝑒.  This  PVTr  varied  linearly  with  𝑅𝑜(𝑟),  increasing  along  the  wing-span  for  all  tested 
values of 𝑅𝑒 and 𝐴𝑅. The relative strength of the PVTr was observed to be inversely proportional 
to  both  𝐴𝑅  and  𝑅𝑒  as  well.  The  PVTr  was  notably  effective  at  𝑅𝑒  =  110  where  it  was  the 
strongest positive term for the entire wing-span seconded by the vorticity diffusion. However, 
when 𝑅𝑒  =  1400, the tilting became the dominant stabilizing term for  𝐴𝑅 = 3 and 5, as the

PVTr still behaved similarly to the 𝑅𝑒  =  110 cases. All of this leads us to conclude that the PVTr 
is a consistent mechanism that limits the growth of the LEV and contributes to its stability, its 
effect  is  particularly  strong  at  𝑅𝑒 = 110  but  less  significant  compared  with  other  three-
dimensional effects (vortex tilting) at 𝑅𝑒 = 1400. Since the PVTr is the gradient of the Coriolis 
acceleration, it is clear that the Coriolis acceleration plays a key role in the LEV stability which is 
in agreement with Lentink & Dickinson (2009a,b); Jardin & David (2014, 2015) and Jardin (2017). 
However, the observation that the vorticity advection grew weaker with increasing 𝐴𝑅 was not 
previously observed. Finally, the results show that the effects of PVTr and possibly other three-
dimensional effects depend on both 𝑅𝑒 and 𝑅𝑜, and that 𝑅𝑜 alone is insufficient to quantify their 
effects on the LEV stability in revolving wings. 

Further work must be done to quantify the effect of angle of attack on the vortex dynamics. 
It  is  possible  that  the  varying  the  angle  of  attack,  for  fixed  𝑅𝑒  and  𝐴𝑅,  could  fundamentally 
change how the PVTr aligns with the region of the LEV. Additionally, an analysis must be done to 
decouple the effect of 𝑅𝑒 and 𝑅𝑜 over a wider parameter space for the rotating wing. A similar 
analysis was done by Harbig et al. (2013b), but this can also be done by fixing the 𝑅𝑒 at a single 
point  along  the  wing-span  for  multiple  𝐴𝑅.  This  could  help  to  better  understand  why  the 
advection decreased with increasing 𝐴𝑅 as was observed in this study.

Supplementary Material 

This section elaborates on the time and spatial-averaging process discussed in §2.3 using the 
data from the 𝐴𝑅 = 5 simulations. The time-averaging process considers the LEV control-volume 
at each time step. This is illustrated for three individual time steps (\tau_0, \tau_1, \tau_2) in the 
third revolution S1a. Since the leading-edge moves forward at each time-step, the region of the 
flow within the LEV control-volume changes. The spatial-averaging considers surfaces coinciding 
with cylinders with radii at different local Rossby numbers 𝑅𝑜(𝑟) bounded by the time-averaged 
LEV control-volume. This is shown in figure S1e. 

Each  of the  time-averaged terms  from  equation  2.6 are displayed  in figures  S3  and  S4  for 
Re=110 and 1400 respectively, with the same symbols and colors as are is in figure 6. Additionally, 
the time-averaged and normalized time derivative of radial vorticity 𝑊∗̂  is plotted using pink stars
