ABSTRACT
Using time-sequence vector magnetic ﬁeld observation from Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager, we examined the connection of non-neutralized currents and the observed
activity in 20 solar active-regions (ARs). The net current in a given magnetic polarity is
algebraic sum of direct-current (DC) and return-current (RC) and the ratio |DC/RC|
is a measure of degree of net-current-neutralization (NCN). In the emerging ARs, the
non-neutrality of these currents builds with the onset of ﬂux emergence, following the
relaxation to neutrality during the separation motion of bipolar regions. Accordingly,
some emerging ARs are source regions of CMEs occurring at the time of higher level
non-neutrality. ARs in the post-emergence phase can be CME productive provided
they have interacting bipolar regions with converging and shearing motions. In these
cases, the net current evolves with higher level (> 1.3) of non-neutrality. Diﬀerently,
the |DC/RC| in ﬂaring and quiet ARs vary near unity. In all the AR samples, the
|DC/RC| is higher for chiral current density than that for vertical current density.
Owing to the fact that the non-neutralized currents arise in the vicinity of sheared
polarity-inversion-lines (SPILs), the proﬁles of the total length of SPIL segments and
the degree of NCN follow each other with a positive correlation. We ﬁnd that the
SPIL is localized as small segments in ﬂaring-ARs whereas it is long continuous in
CME-producing ARs. These observations demonstrate the dividing line between the
CMEs and ﬂares with the diﬀerence being in global or local nature of magnetic shear
in the AR that reﬂected in non-neutralized currents.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is widely accepted that solar eruptions including ﬂares
and CMEs are magnetically driven events and had been the
subject of study for the past four decades. Mainly, these
transient, eruptive events derive their energy from electri-
cal currents that pass through the solar atmosphere. There
are evidential reports that the strong electrical currents in-
volved in major ﬂares are embedded within magnetic ﬂux
emerged from convection zone through photosphere into the
corona (e.g., Leka et al. 1996; Vemareddy et al. 2012). Other
sources that generate these currents are plasma displace-
ments on the surface of the sun (Leka & Barnes 2003a,b;
Schrijver et al. 2005; Vemareddy et al. 2012, 2015). Dissi-
pation of these electrical currents during reconnection is the
supposed mechanism of releasing magnetic energy to ther-
mal and kinetic energy during the transient activity of the
sun (Priest & Forbes 2002).

However, as theorized by Parker (1996), the net electric

current at any cross-section of a ﬂux tube embedded in rel-
atively ﬁeld-free plasma must result in a zero value. In this
scenario, the net current of a ﬂux tube is a sum of direct cur-
rent due to its twist/shear and the return current in a inter-
face layer between the ﬂux tube and the surrounding plasma.
These two (body and surface) currents are opposite in sign
but equal in magnitude. As the ﬂux tubes emanate from the
photosphere, which are conﬁned by the dense plasma, the in-
tegrated net vertical current from the ﬂux tube cross section
is expected to obey the above Parker’s paradigm of neutral-
ized current. However, the observations of net current over a
polarity are quiet deviating from neutrality (Venkatakrish-
nan & Tiwari 2009; Ravindra et al. 2011; Georgoulis et al.
2012; Vemareddy et al. 2015) indicating controversial nature
of theory and observations.

In the presence of plasma ﬂows, the ﬁeld lines connect-
ing the well-isolated polarities are stressed, nevertheless, the
generated currents at their foot points remain neutralized,
according to integral form of Ampere’s law. Even emergence
of current carrying ﬂux tubes in the case of well-separated,
carry vanishing currents. Indeed, using high-resolution ob-

servations of photospheric magnetic ﬁelds, it is found that
the net-current from many isolated sunspots is near to neu-
trality (Venkatakrishnan & Tiwari 2009). The question to
ask what are the factors that contribute to the net current
from a single polarity. Georgoulis et al. (2012) had investi-
gated these issues extensively in two ARs, where they con-
cluded that intense polarity inversion lines (PILs) amid the
compact polarity regions in the core of the ARs support
signiﬁcantly for the non-neutralized currents. This result is
further supplemented by a recent study of Vemareddy et al.
(2015), where the length of strong magnetically sheared PIL
(SPIL) was found to be proportional to the observed net cur-
rent. In this context, a very early study by Falconer (2001)
was the basis for this well proved relation according to which
the presence of strong SPIL is an indicator for the occur-
rence of eruptions and its length is a measure of net vertical
current.

The plasma β in the coronal environment is far less than
unity yielding to gradually dominating ﬁeld aligned currents
over the return currents along the ﬂux tube. As a result,
there is a net current over the cross-section of the ﬂux tube
in the corona. Due to this stratiﬁcation in plasma-β, it is not
well understood, how the net current varies while emerging,
especially at and after the instance of emergence. Employ-
ing numerical simulations of emerging bipolar AR, this issue
was investigated by T¨or¨ok et al. (2014). Neutralization was
observed to increasingly break down during emergence and
retained at a slightly lower value after emergence stopped.
However, it has not yet well investigated whether this is a
characteristic evolution in all emerging ARs. On the other
hand, what is the scenario in the post-emerged ARs where a
diﬀerent boundary motions drive the evolution? In order to
have more insights, the net current evolution and its char-
acteristic time proﬁle of neutralization needs to be system-
atically examined from observations of diﬀerent ARs, which
is the motivation of this study.

Recently, systematic observational study of Liu et al.
(2017) conﬁrmed that the SPIL is the major contributor to
DC and proposed the degree of current-neutralization as the
proxy for assessing the ability of ARs to produce CMEs. In
this view, it would be important to study the the connection
between the degree of net current-neutralization (NCN) with
the nature of generated activity, viz., CMEs or ﬂares, in a
large sample of ARs.

Further, recent study by Vemareddy (2017) shows that
the gradient of magnetic ﬁeld strength contributes to oppo-
site signed, although smaller in magnitude, current to that
contributed by magnetic ﬁeld direction in the vertical com-
ponent of current. As a result, the net current neutralization
is enhanced in a polarity and could substantiates the origins
of sheath current in ﬁeld strength gradients as ﬁrst indicated
in Zhang (2010). This observational evidence also requires
solid basis in more AR cases. The now available uninter-
rupted vector magnetic ﬁeld observations from Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager are very identical for the objectives of
this study, to supplement possible scenarios of electric cur-
rent evolution. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
The observational data and analysis procedure is detailed in
Section 2, the obtained results are described in Section 3. A
discussion is made in Section 4, with a summary in Section 5.

2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND ANALYSIS

PROCEDURE

In this study of AR evolution, we used unprecedented, un-
interrupted photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld observations
obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI,
Schou et al. 2012) aboard Solar Dynamics Observatory. HMI
observes the full solar disk in the Fe i 6173˚A spectral line
with a spatial resolution of 0”.5/pixel. Filtergrams are ob-
tained at six wavelength positions about the line center to
compute Stokes parameters I, Q, U, and V. These are then
reduced with HMI science data processing pipeline (Hoek-
sema et al. 2014) to retrieve the vector magnetic ﬁeld using
Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector algorithm (Borrero
& et al 2011) based on the Milne-Eddington atmospheric
model. The inherent 180◦ azimuthal ambiguity is resolved
using the minimum energy method (Metcalf 1994; Leka et al.
2009). Finally, the projection eﬀects in the ﬁeld components
in native AR patch are corrected by transforming them to
disk center using Cylindrical Equal Area (CEA) projection
method (Calabretta & Greisen 2002). These ﬁeld compo-
nents (Br, Bθ, Bφ) in heliocentric spherical coordinates are
provided as hmi.sharp.cea_720s data product, which are
approximated to (Bz, −By, Bx) in Heliographic Cartesian
coordinates for ready use in various parameter studies (Gary
& Hagyard 1990). Because the projection eﬀects of the ARs
situated beyond ±40◦ longitude severely underestimate the
ﬁeld values and could not be recovered by disk transforma-
tion; we consider the AR’s disk passage within this limit for
their evolution study of net vertical current.

Then, we derive the vertical component of electric cur-
rent density and its decomposed components to twist/chiral
and shear terms (Zhang 2001)

where bx, by, bz are components of the unit magnetic ﬁeld
vector b = B/B with total ﬁeld strength B = |B|. The par-
tial derivatives are approximated by ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme
employing three-point Lagrangian interpolation procedure
(See Vemareddy 2017 for more details). As the names sug-
gest, the decomposition of the current density (J) is not
for twisted and sheared magnetic ﬁeld. Jch is connected
to helicity term or force-free ﬁeld but Jsh is not because
part of the current is perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld
(cross-ﬁeld current). Jzsh actually, provides a quantitative
description of the relationship between the magnetic shear
and gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld and can be written in
a form 1
cos(θ)(∇B)⊥ where θ is the shear angle of the
µ0
photospheric transverse magnetic ﬁeld, (∇B)⊥ is horizon-
tal gradient of magnetic ﬁeld (Zhang 2001). This term con-
nects with the heterogeneity and orientation of magnetic
ﬁeld. Here ﬁeld strength gradients play main role because
cosine of θ ranges between -1 and 1.

The net vertical ﬂux and current are then deduced by
summing the pixels over a particular polarity as given by

(Bz > 0), similarly the decomposed currents Ich, Ish) has
contribution from both positive and negative currents.

In order to have insight on the contribution of each
signed current in the neutralization of the current in each
polarity, we further separate the net current in each polarity
into positive (+) and negative (−) components. The individ-
ual net currents in each polarity always have a systematic
evolution and thus provides insights on their plausible gen-
eration mechanisms. We then evaluate the absolute ratio of
these individual currents, as dominant and non-dominant
net current in each polarity for the evaluation of the abso-
lute ratio of direct-current (DC) and return-current (RC)
(T¨or¨ok et al. 2014). Here, the dominant or non-dominant
with respect to the net current value of positive (or neg-
ative) current over its counter signed net value in a given
magnetic polarity. The sign of the dominant current in a
given magnetic polarity gives the chirality of the AR. With
this ratio, it is easy to monitor their relative time evolution
in concurrent with the ﬂux evolution. The ratio will always
have a value greater than one in magnitude and a value of

one indicates neutralized currents in a polarity. Deviation
from unity level signiﬁes non-neutralization and is a special
case of non-potentiality.

From Equation 1 of vertical current decomposition, ﬁeld
strength gradients are known to contribute opposite signed
currents to that contributed by ﬁeld direction in each polar-
ity regions. The combined result is more net current neutral-
ization (Vemareddy 2017). To know the extent of this con-
tribution, we estimate |DC/RC| for Ich, in a similar way, by
removing current contributed from ﬁeld strength gradients
(Ish).

For observationally reliable values, we consider pixels
having threshold values |Btot| > 200 G in all above com-
putations. These strong ﬁelds also exists with uncertainties
due to the ﬁeld measurements and inversion procedure. The
inversion products are given with estimated errors in the
vertical component varying by about 40 G and in horizon-
tal components by 80 G. As a test case, we propagate these
uncertainties through Equation 1 (see details in Vemareddy

where i, j refer to pixel indices in x and y direction, respec-

is assumed in arriving at the above expression. Taking an
average error δBx = δBy = 40G in a typical distribution
of n = 104 pixels, we found that the range of uncertainty

n × δJzdxdx) of a signed net current in a given polarity
(
can never be larger than 0.1 × 1012A. Here dx is HMI pixel
size of 0(cid:48)(cid:48).5 . Therefore, our estimation of |DC/RC| can have
a maximum error limit of 0.14. As we will see in the later
section, this uncertainty is very small compared to the range
of |DC/RC| evolution in CME and ﬂare producing ARs.

We also traced the sheared PILs in every one-hour snap-
shot by an automated procedure similar to the one applied
for tracing PILs of strong vertical ﬁeld gradients (Mason &
Hoeksema 2010) and applied in a statistical study (Vasan-
tharaju et al. 2018). The sheared PIL is a segment with shear
angle (diﬀerence between directions of observed transverse
ﬁelds Bo and potential transverse ﬁelds Bp and is given by,





θsh = cos−1(Bo · Bp/|Bo||Bp|)) greater than 45◦. In this
procedure, we smooth the vertical magnetic ﬁeld (Bz) im-
age to a smoothing factor of 8 pixels (4 arcsec) and identiﬁed
the zero Gauss contour. Then the potential magnetic ﬁeld
is calculated from the strongly smoothed magnetogram and
the shear map is generated from the computed potential
and the observed transverse ﬁeld. On applying the thresh-
olds of the strong observed transverse ﬁeld (> 300 G) and
strong shear angle (> 45◦) to contour segments, the strong
ﬁeld and strong shear PILs are identiﬁed. The summation
of these PIL segment lengths gives the total length of SPIL
present in the AR.

3 RESULTS

The distribution of vertical current and its components are
examined in all the studied ARs. In all the cases, we no-
tice that the Jz and Jzch have similar distribution in terms
of sign and morphology. However, Jzch and Jzsh vary both
in sign and magnitude. As exemplary cases, these distribu-
tions are shown in three ARs in Figure 1. Signed maps in
the last column panels show distribution of currents that are
having opposite (same) sign of Jzch and Jzsh and are indi-

cated by -1 (1) value. These pixels of opposite sign current
distribution are varying between 60-65% in the studied AR
cases. This kind of distribution indicates that the gradients
of ﬁeld strength contributes to opposite signed current to
that contributed by magnetic ﬁeld direction in the vertical
component of current, which was ﬁrst found by Vemareddy
(2017). Further, the Jzsh seem to show much-higher spatial-
frequencies than Jzch. This may be considered to be consis-
tent with small-scale structures present in sunspot penum-
brae. The investigations by Zhang (2010) also support our
observations. They found that the individual ﬁbrils are dom-
inated by the current density component caused by magnetic
inhomogeneity, while the large-scale magnetic region is gen-
erally dominated by the twist component of the electric cur-
rent density. Vemareddy (2017) examined this concept of
spacial frequencies by smoothing the magnetograms with
diﬀerent spacial windows. Because of large-scale structure,
the Jzch retains the spatial patterns even after smoothing
while Jzsh smears the patterns due to higher spatial fre-
quencies related to small-scale structure.

Then, we observed the time evolution of net chiral (or
twist) current (Ich) in a polarity follows the trend of net
current (I) at a higher magnitude level. Depending on the
sign of Ish, the DC or RC of Jz will be diﬀerently deviated
from the DC or RC of Jzch. We evidenced the sign of Ish
is mostly (2/3) negative to that of Ich in a given polarity,
consequently decreasing the DC value (than that of RC) of
Jz resulting in higher degree of net current neutralization
(NCN) than the net twist current neutralization. In order to

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2019)

make this clear, we show this diﬀerence of neutralization for
both Ich and I in each polarity of an AR.

In the following, we study the evolution of |DC/RC|
in 20 diﬀerent ARs of diﬀerent coronal activity. Most of
these regions are well studied previously in diﬀerent con-
texts. For clarity, we analyzed all of them, and then divided
into groups of their evolution phase and the nature of ac-
tivity. The emerging ARs consists of emerging bipolar re-
gions with sub-photospheric twist and complex interaction
whereas in the post emerged cases, the AR emergence phase
is missed and the evolution consists of ﬂux fragmentation,
diﬀusion, shear motions and/or ﬂux emergence in the pre-
existing ﬂux. As we already know that the ARs in decaying
phase are sometimes very active (e.g., AR12371) and we
search such cases to include here. On the other hand, there
are ARs producing ﬂaring activity associated with/without
CMEs, the so called conﬁned/eruptive ARs. This classiﬁ-
cation has implications to the space-weather exploring the
conditions of an AR to be CME productive. In principle, the
sample can be more than 20, but restricted to put up results
more clearly. Flares are classiﬁed by disk integrated GOES
X-ray ﬂux1. Coronal mass ejection (CME) is a large scale ex-
pulsion of magnetic ﬁeld and plasma from the AR disturbing
the outer corona at least to the LASCO-C2 ﬁeld-of-view ex-
tent. To associate the CMEs with the studied source ARs,
simultaneous coronal observations are scrutinized in asso-

ciation with the LASCO-C2 images2 (Yashiro et al. 2004).
From this qualitative information, we noted the type of coro-
nal activity in relevance to the net current evolution in the
AR. A summary of the AR cases in this study is given in Ta-
ble 1. As providing the details of the individual events in all
20 ARs is spatially prohibited, besides referring to the ear-
lier studies, we noted the timings of prominent CME/ﬂare
events in the text.

3.1 Emerging ARs

We choose set of ﬁve emerging ARs with CME and ﬂaring
activity and studied the NCN with time. In Figure 2, time
evolution of NCN is plotted only for three AR cases. The
|DC/RC| is shown both for positive and negative magnetic
polarity in separate panels. Horizontal dotted line indicates
the NCN of unity referring to equal values of DC and RC
in a magnetic polarity. The net ﬂux of each polarity is also
plotted in the same panels with y-axis scale (in units of 1021
Maxwell) on the right side. A sample vector magnetogram
is depicted in the corresponding ﬁrst row panels with traced
SPILs (blue curve). In all ﬁve AR cases, the |DC/RC| starts
near a value of one and increases rapidly with the fast ﬂux
emergence during about ﬁrst 20 hours. We noticed that this
fast emergence is given by appearance of compact bipolar
regions having SPILs at the interface of opposite polarities.
This phase is then followed by separating motion of bipo-
lar regions becoming isolated bipolar regions. As a result,
ARs become less compact without SPILs as the interface
of opposite polarities diminishes. We see that the |DC/RC|
decreases from the peak value (1.5-2) of highest compact
phase to the unity of well separated polarity regions. As we
can notice that all the ARs have higher value of |DC/RC|
for Jzch than for Jz.

All ﬁve AR cases (serial no 1-5 in Table 1) follow the
proﬁle of the NCN exhibited by simulated emerging bipolar
AR reported by T¨or¨ok et al. (2014). The simulation results
(their Figure 4) showed the development of strong deviation
from NCN simultaneously with the onset of signiﬁcant ﬂux
emergence into the corona, accompanied by the development
of substantial magnetic shear along the AR PIL. After the
region has formed and ﬂux emergence has ceased, the strong
magnetic ﬁelds in the regions center are connected solely by
DCs and the total DC is several times larges than the total
RC.

The AR 11560, 11726 are source regions of C-M ﬂares
and CMEs during the present observation window. A promi-
nent CME occurred in AR 11560 at 1:00UT on September
2, 2012, which is after the peak phase of |DC/RC| value. In
the AR 11726, the coronal eruptions are seen at 20/07:40UT,
22/06:00UT. Owing to the opposite chirality, the AR 11560
have opposite signed DC value than that in AR 11726. These
two cases are studied in the context of helicity and energy
ﬂux injection in Vemareddy (2015). The breakdown of NCN
in these two emerging ARs appears to have correspondence
with the CME occurrence, in agreement with the proposed
CME initiation mechanisms based on ﬂux emergence (Leka
et al. 1996). A similar |DC/RC| evolution follows in ARs

11460, 12089, 12257 however, the activity is limited to C-M
ﬂares without prominent CMEs.

3.2 Post emerged ARs

In Figure 3, the time evolution of |DC/RC| in post emerged
ARs is plotted. As pointed already, the ARs whose emer-
gence phase is not observed are referred as post emerged
ARs. In the post emergence phase, the bipolar regions are
well separated however in some ARs of multi-polar regions,
the separation leads to interaction among other polarities
causing the development of interfering regions with PILs.
In the case of interaction is accompanied by converging and
shearing motion between opposite polarities, the interface
develops to have shared PIL as δ-conﬁguration. The AR
11429 has a larger interface of SPIL (≈ 130Mm) as seen in
the vector magnetogram panel and maintains the |DC/RC|
value above 1.5 throughout the evolution period. While
maintaining high degree of non-neutralization, the AR 11429
produced 7 M, 3 X-class ﬂares, some of which are accompa-
nied by CMEs (Liu et al. 2016). To be noted, the CMEs on
05/1:55UT, 07/00:05UT, 09/03:40UT, 10/17:30UT are very
severe events. This AR is also studied in Sun et al. (2015)
in the activity context and Liu et al. (2017) in the NCN
context.

The AR 12158 has large rotating south polarity sunspot
surrounded by plage type north polarity distribution com-
prising the SPIL. The NCN is near to 1.5 in the observed
period of evolution and have one M-class and one X-class
ﬂare associated with CMEs (Vemareddy et al. 2016). At
the time of the observed two major CMEs (08/23:00UT,
10/17:15UT), the degree of non-neutrality is obove 1.5. The
AR 12371 has a following bipolar region with main SPIL in-
terface and an isolated leading south polarity. In our calcu-
lation of NCN, the leading south polarity is included which
may lower the estimated |DC/RC|. The |DC/RC| is well
above unity to a maximum of 1.3 and the observed activ-
ity is CME associated M-ﬂares (18/16:25UT, 21/02:00UT,
22/17:39UT,24/15:12UT, 25/08:02UT) as studied in Ve-
mareddy (2017). Note that the net magnetic ﬂux in these
cases is decreasing over time to indicate the decay phase of
the AR. Similarly, the ARs 11967, 12403 evolve with strong
deviation of NCN and generates C-M ﬂares some of them
are accompanied by CMEs.

3.3 Flaring ARs

Diﬀerently, we choose another set of ARs having only ﬂar-
ing activity. In Figure 4, the time evolution of |DC/RC| is
plotted for three of these ARs. The current neutralization
oscillates near unity in AR 11166 despite ﬂux emergence in
the post phase of the AR birth. The observed activity is
related to ﬂares including X1.5 at 23.13 UT on March 9,
2011 (Vemareddy & Wiegelmann 2014). The SPILs are in
the form of segments due to embedded north polarity in the
south polarity region. The AR 11928 is an emerging one but
|DC/RC| undulates about unity level unlike the cases in
the group of emerging ARs. No prominent SPIL segments
are noticed in the AR polarity distribution. As studied in
Vemareddy & D´emoulin (2017), the chirality changes from
positive to negative over the observed period of evolution

generating C-ﬂaring activity. The evolution in AR 12192 is
very near to unity satisfying the NCN throughout the evo-
lution. Despite being super AR, no long SPIL is present ex-
cept small segments as noticed in the vector magnetogram
panel. Probably of these reasons, the AR is ﬂare produc-
tive including major X-ﬂares on 22/14:02UT,24/21:07UT,
25/16:55UT, 26/10:04UT,27/14:12UT none of them are as-
sociated with CMEs (Liu et al. 2016; Amari et al. 2018).
Our |DC/RC| proﬁle is very much agreement with Liu et al.
(2017), although derived without applying any masking pro-
cedure. Similarly, the derived NCN proﬁles for AR 11190,
12422 imply near unity evolution related to ﬂaring activity
without CMEs.

3.4 Quiet ARs

ARs without ﬂaring activity greater than C-ﬂares and CMEs
are taken for the study of NCN evolution. Three of such ARs
are shown in Figure 5. In AR 11072, we see ﬂuctuations of
|DC/RC| deviating from neutrality during the emergence
phase till mid of May 23, which diminishes to neutrality
level as the bipolar regions separates without SPILs. Diﬀer-
ent from emerging ARs discussed earlier, the quiet activity
nature could be likely due to lack of twist in the emerg-
ing ﬁeld. The evolution of NCN in AR 11987 follows almost
unity. In AR 12082, the evolution of NCN follows unity in

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2019)

north polarity but deviates signiﬁcantly from unity in south
polarity. A small diﬀerence in degree of NCN between both
polarities may arise (also in Liu et al. 2017) due to various
errors in horizontal ﬁeld measurements (related to observa-
tional sensitivity) and thereby the numerical diﬀerentiation.
Importantly, the diﬀerence would be magniﬁed by division
operation in the ratio of DC and RC. We can have ﬂux im-
balance that is related to plage regions, or individual polar-
ities because the non-neutralized currents comes only from
SPIL vicinity. Since we show the NCN in each polarity, the
imbalance is not a concern at least to the present scope of
the study. In those cases, it may require to choose exact re-
gion of SPIL although considering entire AR yields expected
evolution trend in most of the ARs of our sample.

4 DISCUSSION

Non-neutralized currents arise in the vicinity of SPILs amid
opposite polarity regions in close proximity (Georgoulis et al.
2012). The numerical study of T¨or¨ok & Kliem (2003) ﬁrst
showed that as soon as shearing motions are generated in
the PIL area, non-neutralized currents inevitably build up
in the corona. In their study, shear motions are generated by
vortex ﬂows and the total non-neutralized current is propor-
tional to distance between the opposite ﬂux concentrations.

These studies are extended further to acknowledge the fact
that the breakdown of electric current neutralization occurs
exclusively along SPILs (T¨or¨ok et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2017).

4.1 Diﬀerent views of direct and return currents

In all the AR cases, we see that the |DC/RC| is more for
Jzch than for Jz. It proves that the current due to ﬁeld
strength gradients Jzsh have opposite sign distribution dom-
inantly (60-65%) to that of ﬁeld direction Jzch, substantiat-
ing the result ﬁrst found in AR 11158 by Vemareddy (2017).
This Parker (1996) ﬂux tube view of current neutralization
is explained diﬀerently by Dalmasse et al. (2015) with MHD
simulations. In their view, instead at the interface of ﬂux
tube and the ﬁeld free plasma, the return current is also
a volume current belonging to ﬂux bundle forming a more
or less thick shell between the direct current at the core of
the ﬂux tube and the surrounding potential ﬁeld (or ﬁeld-
free plasma if the ﬂux bundle is embedded in a ﬁeld-free
plasma). From this setup, they inferred that the existence
of the return current is purely a geometric eﬀect and is due
to the presence of diﬀerential twist (variation of twist as a
function of the distance to the ﬂux bundle axis) in the ﬂux
bundle which is necessary to keep the ﬂux bundle conﬁned.
Moreover, in the zero-β MHD simulations of Dalmasse
et al. (2015), the imposed motions along the PIL generate

force-free net current. However, this is not the scenario on
the photosphere, where the Lorentz-force driven shear gen-
erates cross-ﬁeld currents too (Georgoulis et al. 2012) as
the observations implied here. In the photosphere, magnetic
pressure tends to expand the ﬂux tube against the twist that
keeps the ﬂux tube conﬁned.

Our analysis assumes that return/sheath current is a
surface current related to cross-ﬁeld current and coming
partially from Jsh (Georgoulis & LaBonte 2004; Georgoulis
et al. 2012). Strictly, this does not prove that all return cur-
rents are pressure-driven cross-ﬁeld sheath-like shells. This
only shows that the force-free-like currents as considered in
low/zero-beta coronal MHD-models only reveal parts of the
currents that are present in the photosphere. Indeed Fig-
ure 1(left column), does show the existence of both DC and
RC in Jzch, as seen in low/zero-beta models. So the result is
that Ish contributes to the total return currents. With this
only similarity, the models are said to be incomplete for not
having the real photospheric scenario of the currents.

The decomposition of the net current implies the im-
portance of Ich in the coronal processes like ﬂares/CMEs, as
supported by low/zero-beta MHD models. Ish comes from
in-homogeneous pattern of ﬁeld-strength and therefore its
evolution bears no trend. Higher in the corona, the ﬁeld dis-
tribution becomes smooth, and Ish is negligible leaving only
force-free current Ich (Vemareddy 2017).

Figure 5. Same as Figure 2 but for quiet ARs.

While Parker’s neutralized currents require in-situ stor-
age and release of energy, the electric circuit models (Melrose
1991, 1995), on the other hand believe that the currents have
to close at the base of the convection zone where magnetic
ﬁelds are generated. In this scenario, the currents have to
emerge from the solar interior with the emergence of the
magnetic ﬂux. Then the magnetic loops are electric circuits
which have a strong inductive coupling between coronal ﬂar-
ing volume and the convection zone. In both the models,
we anticipate the importance of Ish in generating solar ac-
tivity in the ARs. In case Ish is strong, the Lorentz-force
may generate shear motions in the vicinity of the PIL. The
shear generating Lorentz-force further has physical connec-
tion to the non-neutralized currents (See Georgoulis et al.
2012). Although this exercise is worth to study, we believe
that the Lorentz-force related to Ish would be small. It is
clear from Figure 1 that the Ish comes from almost every-
where in the AR, so it is unlikely that the Ish play signiﬁcant
role in the active events like ﬂares/CMEs. However, an or-
ganized distribution of Jsh may have strong Lorentz-force.
Based on SOT/HINODE vector magnetic ﬁeld observations,
Georgoulis et al. (2012) had already showed that the shear
generating Lorentz-force is signiﬁcant in the ARs. Given the
contribution of Ish in the net-current neutralization, our re-
sults favour the concept of shear-generating Lorentz force
introduced by Georgoulis et al. (2012).

4.2 SPIL length and non-neutralized current

Following the connection between the magnetic shear and
the non-neutralized currents, the length of SPIL is expected
to follow the non-neutralized current evolution in the AR.
This property is observationally veriﬁed in AR 11158 (Ve-
mareddy et al. 2015). The AR 11158 has a systematic evo-
lution of the net current in the two sub-regions where the
SPIL is due to predominant rotational and shear motions of
opposite ﬂux concentrations. It was seen that the net cur-
rent evolution follows the time evolution of total length of
SPIL in both of the sub-regions.

In Figure 6, we compare the proﬁle of |DC/RC| with
the total length of SPIL segments in three ARs. The SPIL
segments are traced by a systematic procedure as explained
in section 2. Throughout the evolution right from the emer-
gence, the total
length of all SPIL segments correlates
well (at a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.69) with the non-
neutralization proﬁle in the AR 11560. A similar correlation
is found by Vemareddy (2019) between the SPIL length and
the |DC/RC| in the eruptive AR 12673. The AR 11429,
12371 have long SPIL interface which have weakly corre-
lated, at a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.45, 0.29 respectively,
with the |DC/RC| proﬁle. It means that the non-neutralized
currents spread in a broader region about PIL. This could
likely be the case in ARs containing large interface of op-
posite polarities where the shearing regions extend into the

opposite polarities. Then the spread of sheared region along
PIL may not represent the length of SPIL interface. This
aspect of SPIL is worth of further detailed investigation in
few more AR cases.

Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the total SPIL length in AR
12192, 11166 is signiﬁcantly large (60-150 Mm, 5-115Mm)
during entire evolution period. It is in the form of small
segments located all over the AR as shown in vector mag-
netograms in Figure 4. Obviously, the net-current in these
ARs is large (orders of 1012A) and probably caused large
ﬂares but none of them associated with CMEs. However, the
|DC/RC| curve remains neutralized. We should point that
the continuity of the SPIL is dependent on the threshold ap-
plied to trace the PIL. Given a lesser threshold (<300 G), the
PIL can be continuous or will have larger segments through
weak-ﬁeld regions. However what matters is the magnetic
shear information in the horizontal ﬁeld components that in
turn connects to the strong twisted structure along the PIL.
Due to weaker horizontal ﬁeld in regions below 300 G, the
magnetic shear could be weak. To our knowledge, there ex-
ists no reports of ﬂux rope structure above along the PIL in
weak ﬁeld regions less than 300 G. Therefore, our distinction
of continuous nature of SPIL is linked to magnetic shear and
twisted ﬂux structure which is a key feature for the CME
eruptions.

4.3 Nature of magnetic shear along PIL

We know that strongly twisted magnetic ﬂux tubes and
strongly sheared structures are candidates for explaining the
intense ﬂares and the associated ﬂux rope eruption from
AR. The segmented or localized distribution of magnetic
shear indicates that the ﬂares are relatively local phenom-
ena, and the released energy is mostly converted into radi-
ation and energetic particles. On the other hand, magnetic
shear along a long continuous PIL interface may refer to
coherently twisted magnetic structure, i.e., a ﬂux rope, as
require by many CME models (Amari et al. 2003; T¨or¨ok &
Kliem 2005). Thus the CMEs are more global phenomena,
and the energy mostly goes into mechanical energies through
the ejection of magnetized plasma structures. Therefore, as
opposed to general view, an intense ﬂare may not necessarily
be accompanied by a CME (e.g., Feynman & Hundhausen
1994; Green et al. 2002; Yashiro et al. 2005; Wang & Zhang
2007) because the occurrence of a CME is substantially de-
termined by the driving force of the inner core magnetic
ﬁeld and the conﬁning force of the external overlying ﬁeld.
From this comparison, the magnetic shear can be distributed
along a continuous PIL referring as global shear in the AR
scale or it can be present along few segmented PILs known
as localized shear. The global shear case is a manifestation
of strong twisted ﬂux rope that may erupt under certain
instability conditions. The local shear case may not form
a twisted ﬂux rope or even exists, the most ﬂux in the AR
acts as a conﬁning environment (magnetic cage) for an erup-
tion to takes place (see also the study of Vemareddy 2017;
Amari et al. 2018). From this observational analysis of the
magnetic shear and the nature of the activity, we suggest
that the conﬁned or eruptive character of an AR is related
to the nature of magnetic shear along the PIL.

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We studied the connection of non-neutralized currents and
the observed activity in 20 solar ARs. Net current evolu-
tion in the AR is derived using every 12 minute HMI vector
magnetograms. For a more general view of the results, we
separate the ARs according to their evolution phase, and
the nature of activity and studied the degree of NCN.

According to the ﬂux rope models of CMEs eruptions
(Zakharov & Shafranov 1986), the hoop force of the CME
ﬂux rope is proportional to square of the net current in the
ﬂux rope channel, thus the breakdown of net current neu-
tralization implies to a form of Lorentz force development
leading to stability loss and the CME eruption. The net cur-
rent in a given polarity is algebraic sum of DC and RC, in
particular their distribution may be relevant for CME/ﬂare
activity (Forbes 2010). The ratio |DC/RC| is a measure of
degree of net current neutralization due to magnetic shear
and twist.

In the emerging ARs, the non-neutrality of the currents
builds with the onset of ﬂux emergence, following the relax-
ation to neutrality during the separation motion of bipolar
regions. Accordingly, those emerging ARs are source regions
of CMEs occurred at the time of higher level non-neutrality.
ARs in the post phase of their emergence can be CME pro-
ductive provided they have interacting bipolar regions with
converging and shearing motions. In these cases, the net cur-
rent evolves with higher level (> 1.3) of non-neutrality. The
net current evolution in ﬂaring and quiet ARs is diﬀerent.
The |DC/RC| in these cases varies near unity indicating
neutralized currents in the magnetic polarities. These ob-
servations demonstrate that the CME eruptions are due to
non-neutralized currents in the ARs, as proposed by Liu
et al. (2017).

With the decomposition of the electric current, in all the
AR cases, we see that the |DC/RC| is more for Jzch than for
Jz. It implies that the current due to ﬁeld strength gradients
Jzsh have opposite sign distribution dominantly (60-65%) to
that of ﬁeld direction Jzch. This further substantiates the
result ﬁrst found in AR 11158 by Vemareddy (2017). Apart
from its role in current-neutralization, Ish can be the origin
of shear-generating Lorentz-force, which further connected
to non-neutralized currents and the solar activity in the ARs
(Georgoulis et al. 2012).

Owing to the fact that the non-neutralized currents
arise in the vicinity of SPILs, the total length of SPIL seg-
ments follows the degree of NCN with a strong correlation
in AR 11560. This correlation is positive but weak in AR
11429, 12371 that could be related to spread of sheared re-
gion about PIL. These ﬁndings are in support of a recent
observational study of the SPIL length and the |DC/RC|
in strong eruptive AR 12673 (Vemareddy 2019). In ﬂaring
ARs, the NCN is closer to unity even with total length of
SPIL segments is large. Moreover, we notice that the SPIL is
continuous in CME producing ARs in contrast to multiple
small segments in ﬂaring ARs which makes a clear diﬀer-
ence in the magnetic shear distribution in the AR scale in
which we refer as global shear in the former cases and local
shear in the later cases. Our study of net current neutral-
ity demonstrates the dividing line between the CMEs and
ﬂares with the diﬀerence being in global or local nature of
magnetic shear in the AR.

Figure 6. Relationship between SPIL length and |DC/RC| in AR 11560, 11429 and 12371. Total length of all SPIL segments is
plotted with time in the respective panels with y-axis scale on right side. Note that SPIL length correlates well (CC=0.69) with the
non-neutralization in the AR 11560.
