(Dated: July 12, 2021)

Within the framework of the dinuclear system model, production cross sections of proton-rich
nuclei with charged numbers of Z=84-90 are investigated systematically. Possible combinations with
the 28Si, 32S, 40Ar bombarding the target nuclides 165Ho, 169Tm, 170−174Yb, 175,176Lu, 174,176−180 Hf
and 181Ta are analyzed thoroughly. The optimal excitation energies and evaporation channels
are proposed to produce the proton-rich nuclei. The systems are feasible to be constructed in
experiments.
It is found that the neutron shell closure of N=126 is of importance during the
evaporation of neutrons. The experimental excitation functions in the 40Ar induced reactions can
be nicely reproduced. The charged particle evaporation is comparable with neutrons in cooling
the excited proton-rich nuclei, in particular for the channels with α and proton evaporation. The
production cross section increases with the mass asymmetry of colliding systems because of the
decrease of the inner fusion barrier. The channels with pure neutron evaporation depend on the
isotopic targets. But it is diﬀerent for the channels with charged particles and more sensitive to the
odd-even eﬀect.

INTRODUCTION

≥

The synthesis of superheavy nuclei (Z

106) is a very
important subject in nuclear physics, motivated by reach-
ing the island of stability predicted theoretically and by
exploring the shell evolution and structure properties.
It has obtained much progress in experiments with the
fusion-evaporation reaction mechanism, i.e., the hot fu-
sion reactions with the 48Ca bombarding the actinide nu-
clides and the cold fusion reactions based on the targets
of 208Pb or 209Bi [1–6]. The heavy proton-rich nuclei
(Z>83) undergo the α decay and can be easily iden-
tiﬁed in experiments. The structure properties of the
proton-rich nuclei (PRN) associated with the ﬁssion bar-
rier, density proﬁles of neutrons and protons, proton-drip
line, level spectra etc would be helpful to extend the su-
perheavy region. A number of models have been devel-
oped for understanding the formation mechanism of su-
perheavy nuclei and heavy PRN in the fusion-evaporation
reactions [7–20]. The formation of superheavy nuclei in
the massive fusion reactions is hindered due to the quasi-
ﬁssion process. The investigation of the formation mech-
anism of PRN around Z = 84-90 provides the possibility
for exploring the fusion hindrance and can be extrapo-
lated to the superheavy region, which may be useful for
synthesizing the new isotopes of heaviest nuclei in the
asymmetry actinide-based fusion-evaporation reactions
with the emission of charge particles [21]. Proton-rich
nuclei produced in hot fusion reactions around Z = 84-90
are close to the shell closure of N = 126. The survivabil-
ity of heavy ﬁssile nuclei strongly depends on the ﬁssion
barrier of a compound nucleus. The barrier is related to

the angular momentum and excitation energy [22, 23].
On the other hand, the proton-rich nuclei around Z=84-
90 are useful in understanding the decay modes of excited
heavy nuclei, which would be helpful for accurately es-
timating the survival probability of superheavy nuclei in
the fusion-evaporation reactions.

In this work, we will investigate the reaction mecha-
nism for producing the proton-rich isotopes of Po, At,
Rn, Fr, Ra, Ac, Th in the fusion-evaporation reactions
within the dinuclear system (DNS) model [8]. The evap-
oration residue excitation functions in the xn, xn1p and
xn1p1α channels with the x being the neutron numbers
are analyzed systematically. The article is organized as
follows. In section II we give a brief description of the
DNS model. Calculated results and discussion are pre-
sented in section III. Summary is concluded in section
IV.

II. MODEL DESCRIPTION

The dinuclear system (DNS) is a molecular conﬁgura-
tion of two touching nuclei which keep their own individ-
uality. Such a system has an evolution along two main
degrees of freedom: (i) the relative motion of the nu-
clei in the interaction potential to form the DNS and the
decay of the DNS (qusai-ﬁssion process) along the elon-
gation degree of freedom (internuclear motion); (ii) the
transfer of nucleons in the mass asymmetry coordinate
A2)/(A1 + A2) between two nuclei, which is
η = (A1 −
a diﬀusion process of the excited systems leading to the
compound nucleus formation [8]. Oﬀ-diagonal diﬀusion
in the surface (A1, R) is not considered since we assume
the DNS is formed at the minimum position of the inter-
action potential of two colliding nuclei. In this concept,
the evaporation residue cross section is expressed as a

Here, T (Ec.m.) is the penetration probability of the two
colliding nuclei overcoming the Coulomb barrier to form
the DNS, which is calculated using the empirical coupled
channel model [7]. The PCN is the probability that the
heavy system evolves from a touching conﬁguration into
the formation of compound nucleus in competition with
quasi-ﬁssion and ﬁssion of the heavy fragments [8]. The
last term is the survival probability of the formed com-
pound nucleus, which can be estimated with the statisti-
cal evaporation model by considering the competition be-
tween neutron evaporation ,γ-emitting, charged-particle
evaporation and ﬁssion. we take the maximal angular
momentum as Jmax = 30-50 ¯h since the ﬁssion barrier of
the heavy nucleus disappears at high spin [24].

B. Fusion probability

In order to describe the fusion dynamics as a diﬀusion
process in mass asymmetry, the analytical solution of the
Fokker-Planck equation and the numerical solution of the
master equations have been used, which were also used
to treat deep inelastic heavy-ion collisions. Here, the
fusion probability is obtained by solving a set of master
equations numerically in the potential energy surface of
the DNS. The time evolution of the distribution function
P (A1, E1, t) for fragment 1 with mass number A1 and
excitation energy E1 is described by the following master
equations [8, 9],

macroscopic state (Z1, N1, E1). The sum is taking all
possible proton and neutron numbers that fragment Z ′

1 with respect to fragment A1, which is deter-
mined by the dissipation energy from the relative mo-
tion and potential energy surface of DNS [30, 31]. The
dissipation energy is described by the parametrization
method of classical deﬂection function [32]. The motion
of nucleons in the interacting potential is governed by the
single-particle Hamiltonian [33, 34] as

the single particle energies and the interaction matrix ele-
ments, respectively. The single particle states are deﬁned
with respect to the centers of the interacting nuclei and
are assumed to be orthogonalized in the overlap region.
So the annihilation and creation operators are dependent
on time. The single particle matrix elements are param-
eterized by

The detailed calculation of these parameters and the
mean transition probabilities were described in Ref. [33].
The evolution of the DNS along the variable R leads
to the quasi-ﬁssion of the DNS. The quasi-ﬁssion rate
Λqf can be estimated with the one-dimensional Kramers
formula [35, 36]:

Here the quasi-ﬁssion barrier is counted from the depth
of the pocket of the interaction potential. The local tem-
ε∗/a
perature is given by the Fermi-gas expression Θ =
corresponding to the local excitation energy ε∗ and level
density parameter a in Eq. (41). In Eq. (16) the fre-
quency ωBqf is the frequency of the inverted harmonic
oscillator approximating the interaction potential of two
nuclei in R around the top of the quasi-ﬁssion barrier,
and ω is the frequency of the harmonic oscillator ap-
proximating the potential in R around the bottom of
the pocket. The quantity Γ, which denotes the double
average width of the contributing single-particle states,
determines the friction coeﬃcients: γii′ = Γ
¯h µii′ , with µii′
being the inertia tensor. Here we use constant values Γ
= 2.8 MeV, ¯hωBqf = 2.0 MeV and ¯hω = 3.0 MeV for
the following reactions. The Kramers formula is derived
with the quasi-stationary condition of the temperature
Bqf (A1, A2). However, the numerical calculation
Θ(t)
≤
in Ref.
(16) is also useful for
the condition of Θ(t) > Bqf (A1, A2). In the reactions of
synthesizing superheavy nuclei or PRN, there is the pos-
sibility of the ﬁssion of the heavy fragment in the DNS.
Because the ﬁssility increases with the charge number
of the nucleus, the ﬁssion of the heavy fragment can af-
fect the quasi-ﬁssion and fusion when the DNS evolves
towards larger mass asymmetry. The ﬁssion rate Λf is

[36] indicated that Eq.

formula [35]

where the ωg.s. and ωf are the frequencies of the os-
cillators approximating the ﬁssion-path potential at the
ground state and on the top of the ﬁssion barrier for nu-
cleus A1 or A2 (larger fragment), respectively. Here, we
take ¯hωg.s. = ¯hωf = 1.0 MeV, Γ0 = 2 MeV. The ﬁssion
barrier is calculated as the sum of a macroscopic part
and the shell correction energy (see Eq. (33)). The ﬁs-
sion of the heavy fragment does not favor the diﬀusion of
the system to a light fragment distribution. Therefore,
it leads to a slight decrease of the fusion probability (see
Eq. (24)).

In the relaxation process of the relative motion, the
DNS will be excited by the dissipation of the relative ki-
netic energy. The excited system opens a valence space
∆εK in fragment K (K = 1, 2), which has a symmet-
rical distribution around the Fermi surface. Only the
particles in the states within this valence space are ac-
tively involved in excitation and transfer. The averages
on these quantities are performed in the valence space:

∆εK, which gives the dimension

Here the U (A1, A2) and U (AP , AT ) are the driving po-

the entrance point of the DNS), respectively. The de-
tailed calculation of the driving potentials is from Eq.
(21). The excitation energy Ex of the composite system
is converted from the relative kinetic energy loss, which
is related to the Coulomb barrier B [37].

The potential energy surface (PES; i.e., the driving

potential) of the DNS is given by

U (A1, A2, J, R; β1, β2, θ1, θ2) = B(A1) + B(A2)
[B(A) + V CN

with A1 + A2 = A. Here B(Ai)(i = 1, 2) and B(A)
are the negative binding energies of the fragment Ai and
the compound nucleus A, respectively, in which the shell

and the pairing corrections are included reasonably; V CN
rot
is the rotation energy of the compound nucleus; the βi
represent quadrupole deformations of the two fragments;
the θi denote the angles between the collision orientations
and the symmetry axes of deformed nuclei. The interac-
tion potential between fragment 1(Z1, A1) and 2(Z2, A2)
includes the nuclear, Coulomb, and centrifugal parts as

V (A1, A2, J, R; β1, β2, θ1, θ2) =

where the reduced mass is given by µ = m

with the nucleon mass m. The nuclear potential and
Coulomb potential are taken from Eq. (7) and Eq. (11),
In the actual calculation, the distance R
respectively.
between the centers of the two fragments is chosen to
be the value that gives the minimum of the interaction
potential, in which the DNS is considered to be formed.
So the PES depends only on the mass asymmetry degree
of freedom η, which gives the driving potential of the
DNS.

After reaching the reaction time in the evolution of
P (A1, E1, t), all those components on the left side of the
BG (Businaro-Gallone) point contribute to the formation
of the compound nucleus. The hindrance in the diﬀusion
process by nucleon transfer to form the compound nu-
cleus is the inner fusion barrier Bf us, which is deﬁned as
the diﬀerence of the driving potential at the BG point and
at the entrance position. Nucleon transfers to more sym-
metric fragments that leads to quasi-ﬁssion. The forma-
tion probability of the compound nucleus at the Coulomb
barrier B and angular momentum J is given by

PCN (Ec.m., J, B) =

P (A1, E1, τint(Ec.m., J, B))

ABG

XA1=1

(23)

Here the interaction time τint(Ec.m., J, B) is obtained us-
ing the deﬂection function method [30], which means the
time duration for nucleon transfer from the capture stage
to the formation of the complete fusion system with the
order of 10−20 s. We obtain the fusion probability as

PCN (Ec.m., J) =

metric Gaussian form (see Eq. (4)). So the fusion cross

C. The survival probability of the excited
compound nucleus

The survival probability is particularly important in
evaluation of the cross section, which is usually calcu-
lated with the statistical approach. The physical pro-
cess in understanding the excited nucleus is clear. But
the magnitude strongly depends on the ingredients in the
statistical model, such as level density, separation energy,
shell correction, ﬁssion barrier etc. The excited nucleus
is cooled by evaporating γ-rays, light particles (neutrons,
protons, α etc) in competition with ﬁssion. Similar to
neutron evaporation [9], the probability in the channel of
evaporating the x

The charged particles (p, α) have smaller widths for the
superheavy nucleus in comparison to the proton-rich nu-
cleus because of larger separation energies. The ﬁssion
width increases rapidly in the excitation energy range of
10 - 30 MeV for the superheavy nucleus and the larger
width leads to a smaller survival probability, which is
because the ﬁssion barrier decreases exponentially with
increasing excitation energy [9]. The collective enhance-
ment factor increases the level density, but reduces the
partial widths, in particular for particle evaporation.

In order to test the model as discussed in Sec. II, the
maximal cross sections in the channels stated as shown in
Table 1 in the 40Ar induced fusion-evaporation reactions
are calculated and compared with the available data mea-
sured at Gesellschaft f¨ur Schwerionenforschung at Darm-
stadt, Germany [49]. The dominant evaporation channels
are underlined in the calculation. The charged particle
evaporation is comparable to the pure neutron channels
for the proton-rich nuclei. The ﬁssion barrier is high and
even larger than the particle separation energy. It is dif-
ferent to the superheavy region, in which the charged
particle evaporation can be neglected in comparison to
the neutron emission because of the higher Coulomb bar-
rier [7, 8]. Overall, the experimental cross sections can
be understood nicely well.

More sophisticated comparison is shown in Fig. 1 for
the reactions of 40Ar + 165Ho (left panel) and 40Ar +
169Tm (right panel). The evaporation channels are la-
beled with the 2
6n de-excitation from the compound
nucleus. The mass table and shell correction energy from
Ref. [44] are taken in the calculation. Diﬀerent to the su-

−

7

−

perheavy nucleus formation, the maximal cross sections
of the 4
6n channels are similar because the ﬁssion bar-
rier is not reduced with increasing the excitation energy.
The neutron numbers (120 and 122) of the excited com-
pound nuclei are below the shell closure N=126, which
lead to the neutron evaporation dominating the decay
process. However, the neutron evaporation is strongly
suppressed for the neutron number around the shell clo-
sure as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 in collisions of 40Ar
on 176Hf and 177,178Hf, respectively. The combined chan-
nels with proton or α contribute the cooling process. The
channels of 1p4n, 1p5n, 1α4n and 1α5n have larger cross
sections than the 4
6n evaporation. The cross sections
of pure neutron evaporation increase rapidly with the
neutron numbers of compound nuclei as shown in Fig.
4. However, the channels with charged particles weakly
depend on the isotopic targets. The maximal cross sec-
tions of charged particle evaporation are similar because
the ﬁssion barrier does not decrease after emitting a neu-
6n. The available data are
tron, e.g., 1p4
nicely reproduced with the DNS model and each evapo-
ration channels can be clearly explained.

The inﬂuence of entrance systems on the formation
of proton-rich nuclei is analyzed thoroughly within the
DNS model. Shown in Fig. 5 is the fusion-evaporation
cross sections with 28Si, 32S and 40Ar bombarding 170Yb
for producing the neutron-rich around Z=83-88 from the
compound nuclei 198Po∗, 202Rn∗ and 210Ra∗. The red,
blue and black lines correspond to the projectiles of 28Si,
32S and 40Ar, respectively. The diﬀerent symbols from
left to right side in each panel represent the evaporation
5n1p1α
6n1p, 2
channels, e.g., 3
respective to the panels of (a), (b), (c) and (d) respec-
tively.
It should be noticed that the residue cross sec-
tions increase with the mass asymmetry because of the
reduction of the inner fusion barrier except for the left
channels, i.e., 3n, 2n1p, 2n1α and 1n1p1α, which are
attributed from the competition of fusion and survival
probabilities. The even-odd eﬀect is pronounced in the
pure neutron evaporation. However, the maximal cross
sections are similar in the charged particle channels, e.g.,
3
5n1p1α. The ﬁssion barriers are
larger than the particle separation energy in the region of
Z=82-90 [50]. The fusion probability reaches a constant
value at the excitation energies above 40 MeV. Therefore,
the maximal cross sections for the charged channels are
not reduced with increasing the excitation energy. The
fusion-evaporation excitation functions are further ana-
lyzed in Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 for the targets of
174Hf, 175Lu and 181Ta, respectively. Besides the inner
fusion barrier of DNS, the particle separation energy is
also important on the residue cross section, in particu-
lar for the neutron evaporation around the shell closure

N=126. It is obvious that the neutron channels for the
targets of 170Yb and 174Hf have smaller cross sections in
comparison to 175Lu and 181Ta.

The reactions of 28Si + 174Hf and 32S + 170Yb lead to
the same compound nucleus 202Rn formation. The both
systems have the similar capture and fusion probabilities
at the same excitation energy, which result in the same

40Ar + 181Ta via xn1p1α evaporation channels, in which
the residue nuclei are created around the neutron shell
closure of N=126. The neutron channels of 32S + 181Ta
and 40Ar + 175Lu, the xn1p channels of 40Ar + 174Hf
and the xn1α channels of 40Ar + 181Ta are available for
the production of Ac (Z=89) isotopes with the maximal
104
105 nb, 105 nb, 6
cross sections of 3
nb, respectively. It is obvious that the systems of 32S +
181Ta and 40Ar + 175Lu in the neutron evaporation are
favorable for producing the proton-rich Ac production.
The optimal projectile-target combinations in producing
the proton-rich nuclei around Z=84-90 are the competi-
tion of the pure neutron evaporation and charged particle
emissions.

Isotopic dependence on production cross section

of proton-rich nuclei

The production of PRN depends on the isotopic com-
bination of the target and projectile in the fusion-
evaporation reactions. For example, the maximal cross
62.64 nb for the reaction of 40Ar +
section is 174
212Th + 4n. However, it becomes the value
176Hf
216Th
0.52 µb for the reaction 40Ar + 180Hf
of 30.5
+ 4n [49]. Studies of isotopic trends in the production
PRN would be helpful for predicting the optimal com-
binations and the optimal excitation energies (incident
energy) in experiments. Shown in Fig. 9 and in Fig. 10
is the isotopic distributions with the targets of Yb and
Hf, respectively. The channels of 4
6n, 3n1α, 4n1α
and 4n1p are analyzed thoroughly with the projectiles of
28Si, 32S and 40Ar, respectively. The available experi-
mental data (circles with error bars) in the reactions of
40Ar + 171,174Yb and 40Ar + 176−180Hf are shown for

comparison. It is obvious that the neutron evaporation
cross section increases with the mass of isotopic target be-
cause of the reduction of separation energy. However, the
channels with the charged particles are independent on
the mass number of targets, but related to the projectile-
target asymmetry.

The isotopic trends are mainly caused from the inner
fusion barrier of DNS, particle separation energy and ﬁs-
sion barrier. When the target neutrons increase, the DNS
gets more asymmetry and the fusion probability is en-
hanced owing to the reduction of inner fusion barrier.
A smaller neutron separation energy and a higher ﬁs-
sion barrier lead to a larger survival probability. The
nucleus around shell closure has a larger shell correc-
tion energy and neutron separation energy. For the PRN
around Z=84-90, the ﬁssion barrier is mainly contributed
from the macroscopic energy (The ﬁrst term in Eq. (33))
and even larger than the particle separation energy. The
charged particle escaped from the mother nucleus is com-
parable to neutron evaporation for the proton-rich nu-
clei. The residue nucleus becomes more neutron-rich af-
ter emitting a charged particle. The experimental data in
the 40Ar + 171,174Yb reactions are underestimated with
the DNS model. But the isotopic structure is consis-
tent with the calculations. All channels of the 40Ar +
176−180Hf reactions are nicely reproduced. The systems
could be easily constructed in experiments. The attempts
to explore the structure information and decay properties
of the proton-rich nuclei are proposed, in particular at the
Heavy-Ion Accelerator Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Within the DNS concept, a dynamical model is used
for describing the production of proton-rich nuclei in
fusion-evaporation reactions. The fusion dynamics in
the hot fusion reactions for producing the proton-rich

13

nuclei around Z=84-90 are investigated systematically.
The calculated results are in good agreement with avail-
able experimental data within error bars. The neutron
shell closure of N=126 continues to be of importance in
the proton-rich domain. The odd-even eﬀect appears in
the neutron evaporation. The residue cross sections in
the neutron channels increases with the mass of isotopic
target in the 28Si, 32S and 40Ar induced reactions. How-
ever, the channels with the charged particles are inde-
pendent on the mass number of targets, but related to
the projectile-target asymmetry. The maximal cross sec-
6n and
7n, 1α3
tions in the channels of 4
1α1p3
5n for the PRN production weakly depend on
the excitation energy.

The physical nature of the synthesis of heavy ﬁssile nu-
clei in fusion-evaporation reactions is very complicated,
involving not only certain quantities that crucially inﬂu-
ence the whole process but also the dynamics of the pro-
cess. The coupling of the dynamic deformation and the
nucleon transfer in the course of overcoming the multidi-
mensional PES has to be considered in the DNS model.
The height of the ﬁssion barrier for heavy nuclei is mainly
determined by the shell correction energies at the ground
state and at the saddle point. Further work is in progress.
