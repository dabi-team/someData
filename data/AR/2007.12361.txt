Abstract

The physics of the solar chromosphere is complex from both theoretical and mod-

eling perspectives. The plasma temperature from the photosphere to corona increases

from ∼5,000 K to ∼1 million K over a distance of only ∼10,000 km from the chro-

mosphere and the transition region. Certain regions of the solar atmosphere have suf-

ﬁciently low temperature and ionization rates to be considered as weakly-ionized. In

particular, this is true at the lower chromosphere. In this paper, we present an overview

of our data-driven magnetohydrodynamics model for the weakly-ionized chromosphere

and show a benchmark result. It utilizes the Cowling resistivity which is orders of mag-

nitude greater than the Coulomb resistivity. Ohm’s law therefore includes anisotropic

dissipation. We investigate the eﬀects of the Cowling resistivity on heating and mag-

netic reconnection in the chromosphere as the ﬂare-producing active region (AR) 11166

evolves. In particular, we analyze a C2.0 ﬂare emerging from AR11166 and ﬁnd a nor-

malized reconnection rate of 0.12.

Introduction

Chromosphere is a particularly diﬃcult region to model in the solar atmosphere. Together
with the transition region, it can be considered as a transition layer from the photosphere
to the corona where the plasma temperature increases from ∼5,000 K to ∼1 million K
over a distance of only ∼10,000 km. The low temperature in the photosphere results in an
ionization fraction of about ni/n ≈ 10−4 where 1 corresponds to fully ionized plasma. In
the chromosphere, the ionization fraction increases but always remains below 1 [1]. The
dominant mechanism for ionization in the chromosphere is photoionization with the rate for
hydrogen ≈ 0.014 s−1, which is orders of magnitude greater than the ionization rate due to
electron collisions of ≈ 7.8 × 10−5 s−1 [2]. Therefore, in order to model the chromosphere
properly, the physics of weakly-ionized plasmas should be taken into account.

Chromosphere models can be classiﬁed as part of either global solar atmosphere models
(e.g., [3, 4]) or local models that simulate the evolution of active regions (ARs). In the latter
category (e.g., [5, 6, 7]), there are ﬂux emergence models that extend through the upper
convection zone, photosphere, chromosphere, and transition region into the corona. These
are local models that include the physical processes to model the weakly-ionized plasma in
the chromosphere.

In this paper, we present a data-driven magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model for the
weakly-ionized chromosphere. It is driven by photospheric vector magnetogram data from
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) [8] onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) [9], hence we do not consider the upper convection zone unlike the ﬂux emergence
models. [10] indicates that the data-driven MHD simulations of AR evolution give accurate
results when driven by magnetogram data with a cadence of 12 minutes. This result is
quite promising for the utilization of HMI vector magnetogram data with a cadence of 12
minutes to drive such simulations. This will give us the possibility to eventually couple our
chromosphere model with our data-driven MHD model for global solar corona [11].

We take the partial ionization eﬀects in the chromospheric plasma into account by in-
cluding the Cowling resistivity. [12] showed that the electrical conductivity (the Cowling
conductivity) of a non-stationary plasma can be signiﬁcantly decreased owing to ion acceler-
ation by Ampere’s force. Collisions between ion and neutral particles become very eﬀective
because of the high ion velocities. As a result, the magnetic ﬂux is not conserved and
the rate of magnetic reconnection might be considerably increased due to Joule’s (Ohmic)
dissipation [13].

From the perspective of energy balance in the weakly-ionized chromosphere, Cowling
resistivity leads to additional dissipation of currents perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld

1

resulting in Joule heating that is several orders of magnitude larger compared to the fully
ionized plasma.

Section 2 gives an overview of our data-driven MHD model for the weakly-ionized chromo-
sphere and presents the benchmark result. In section 3, we focus on the Cowling resistivity
and discuss its eﬀects on heating and magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere based on
an analysis using extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) channel 171 ˚A images from the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) [14] onboard SDO and photospheric vector magnetograms from
SDO/HMI. In particular, we follow the evolution of AR11166, and its eﬀect on magnetic
reconnection and the formation of a C2.0 ﬂare. Finally, section 4 presents our conclusions.

2 Data-driven MHD model for the weakly-ionized chro-

mosphere

In this section, we present an overview of our data-driven MHD model in terms of the
modeling framework, governing equations, initial and boundary conditions, and numerical
methods, respectively. We also show a result from a benchmark case obtained with our
model.

2.1 Modeling framework

The modeling framework for our MHD simulations is Multi-Scale Fluid-Kinetic Simulation
Suite (MS-FLUKSS) [15]. It allows multi-ﬂuid and coupled MHD plasma / kinetic neutral
atoms simulations of partially-ionized plasma. It can also treat pickup ions (e.g., [16, 17]).
MS-FLUKSS consists of subroutines implemented on both Cartesian and spherical meshes
to solve MHD, Euler, and kinetic Boltzmann equations. It is built upon the Chombo adap-
tive mesh reﬁnement (AMR) framework [18] developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory. MS-FLUKSS utilizes parallel HDF5 library to store and manage data. It has
excellent scalability up to 150,000 cores on major national supercomputers such as ORNL’s
Jaguar and Titan, NCSAs Blue Waters, NASAs Pleiades, and conventional Linux clusters.
MS-FLUKSS is very exible with respect to specifying diﬀerent time-dependent BCs
(e.g., [11, 19, 20]). It reads input data sets (observational or numerically obtained, including
those from other numerical codes) and interpolates them to chosen spatial and temporal
grids.

source terms corresponding to viscous heating, shock heating, thermal conduction, radiative
transfer, and coronal heating.

To evaluate the expression for the Cowling resistivity, ηC, an estimate for the neutral

fraction ξn is required as a function of density and temperature (to be described below).

Following the method of [21] an electro-neutral hydrogen plasma is assumed. The solar
chromosphere is not in LTE, hence a simple one-level model for the hydrogen atom is in-
adequate for these conditions [22]. To calculate ionization degrees in a non-LTE situation
requires the solution of the radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations. These
are very time consuming to calculate. For this reason, approximations of non-LTE eﬀects
on hydrogen ionization have been developed. Accordingly, a two-level model is used for the
hydrogen atom, as this provides us with a good approximation for hydrogen ionization at
chromospheric densities and temperatures [23]. Under this approximation, the ionization
equation [24] is solved assuming that thermal collisional ionization is not important when
compared to photoionization [25]. The steady state solution to this equation is given by [23]
(i.e., the modiﬁed Saha equation for non-LTE chromosphere):

To calculate the Coulomb and Cowling resistivities, we need the plasma bulk density and
temperature as well as the ion and electron number densities, ni and ne, in the chromosphere.
These values are tabulated by the VAL-C model [27] based on Skylab observations (see
Figure 1). We compute the magnetic ﬁeld from the non-force-free-ﬁeld (NFFF) extrapolation
technique [28, 29] based on the photospheric vector magnetograms from SDO/HMI.

hydrogen ion number density (cm−3) proﬁles in the chromosphere obtained from the VAL-C
model [27].

2.3 Initial and boundary conditions

The computational domain consists of a box with the bottom and top boundaries located
at the photosphere and lower corona, respectively. The box size is chosen to be suﬃciently
large to cover the AR. For example, for AR11166, which is the AR of interest in section 3,
it is 203×128×128 Mm in the x, y and z directions, respectively where the horizontal plane
is indicated by the x and y axes, and z axis is the height from the photosphere.

The initial solution for magnetic ﬁeld is computed from the NFFF extrapolation. The
chromospheric plasma is assumed to be initially at rest. We specify stratiﬁed temperature
and density distributions obtained from the VAL-C model between 0-2,500 km height from
the photosphere. Above 2,500 km, we assume a normalized stratiﬁed temperature distri-
bution as in [5, 30], and a density distribution calculated from the hydrostatic equilibrium
equation and the ideal gas law accordingly. Our computational grid is stratiﬁed with height
in accordance with the stratiﬁed chromospheric plasma parameter distributions in order to

5

resolve the large gradient of the plasma parameters near the photosphere and meanwhile
avoid too much computational overhead [30].

We apply characteristic boundary conditions [11, 31] inspired from [32] to drive our
model by observational data on the photosphere (i.e., HMI vector magnetogram data and
horizontal velocity data computed by applying the DAVE4VM method [33, 34] to vector
magnetograms) to solve for a realistic solar chromosphere model. This will allow us to
specify suﬃcient number of mathematically admissible boundary conditions. In the outer
and side boundaries, we have the option to specify characteristic or non-reﬂective boundary
conditions.

2.4 Numerical methods

We discretize the advective ﬂuxes in Eq. 1 using an upwind cell-centered Finite Volume
method based on approximate Riemann solvers (i.e., total variation diminishing (TVD)
Roe’s scheme or Rusanov’s scheme). The boundary conditions are speciﬁed in the layers of
ghost cells located outside the domain adjacent to the boundary cells. The diﬀusive ﬂuxes
are discretized using central discretization. The time derivatives are discretized using explicit
time integration schemes implemented in MS-FLUKSS, namely forward Euler, Runge-Kutta
2-step, and Hancock’s scheme. In order to increase the convergence speed, we apply local
time-stepping.

Since explicit schemes are used for time integration, we determine the iteration timestep
∆t according to the CFL condition. For this model, the value of ηC becomes the dominant
eﬀect on the condition for stability of the numerical solution to the induction equation as the
ratio of ηC
η can be orders of magnitude (see Figure 3 (left)). In order to avoid subjecting the
whole scheme to this diﬀusion timestep condition, the resistive update for a weakly-ionized
plasma should be done separately from the main update for ideal MHD by sub-cycling the
resistive update inside each ideal step [5].

Let us recall the SN A term in Eq. 1 which is the combination of non-adiabatic source
terms in the energy equation. These terms are diﬃcult to model quantitatively. In order
to model the cumulative eﬀects of these terms, we solve a Newton-cooling equation at each
timestep in addition to the MHD equations to relax the speciﬁc energy density to match
the plasma temperature to the initial stratiﬁed chromospheric temperature proﬁle given in
subsection 2.3. This equation takes the form dE
where the speciﬁc energy of the
plasma is relaxed to its initial state in a time scale τ = (cid:0)

In Figure 2, a benchmark result obtained by our chromosphere model shows an analytical
magnetic ﬁeld topology extrapolated by using the linear-force-free-ﬁeld (LFFF) technique
that is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium. The hydrostatic equilibrium and hence the initial
extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld topology is preserved throughout the whole simulation, validat-
ing our local simulation setup.

3 Cowling resistivity in the chromosphere

In this section, we discuss the variation and eﬀects of the Cowling resistivity on the heating
and magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere, in particular during the evolution of a
ﬂare-producing active region AR11166.

As can be seen in the induction and energy equations in Eq. 1, the Cowling resistivity

(13)

We observe the evolution of AR11166 at 13 timesteps between 2011-03-07T06:00:29 UT
and 2011-03-11T06:00:29 UT with a cadence of 8 hours. Figure 3 (left) shows the variations
of the maximum values of Cowling and Coulomb resistivity proﬁles with height at 2011-
03-07T06:00:29 UT. Accordingly, the Cowling resistivity is orders of magnitude larger than

7

the Coulomb resistivity in the chromosphere, especially between 1-2 Mm. Figure 3 (right)
presents the variation of the maximum values of the frictional Joule heating proﬁles with
height in the chromosphere due to Cowling and Coulomb resistivities.
It shows that the
chromospheric heating due to the dissipation of currents perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld dominates the heating due to the dissipation of currents parallel to it. This ﬁgure
demonstrates the signiﬁcance of Cowling resistivity for chromospheric heating. Figure 3
(bottom) shows the time-dependent variation of Cowling resistivity at ∼1.8 Mm height
above the photosphere during the evolution of AR11166. The Cowling resistivity distribution
follows the AR structure quite well primarily due to its strong dependence on the magnetic
ﬁeld strength (see Eq. 6). For this reason, its time variation shown in Figure 3 (bottom)
can reveal how diﬀerent structures on the AR evolve in time. Accordingly, the structures at
the upper-right and upper-left do not change much as can be deduced from the vertical non-
interacting contour structures whereas the other structures interact with each other above
the polarity inversion line.

Since the Cowling resistivity is orders of magnitude larger than the Coulomb resistivity
in the chromosphere, it can in principle increase the magnetic reconnection rate signiﬁcantly,
and hence play a role in the ﬂare formation, especially in a low-lying 3D null point conﬁgu-
ration.

In Figure 4, we show such a 3D null point conﬁguration at 2011-03-10T14:23:36 UT
resulting in the C2.0 ﬂare (see Figure 4 caption for details) emerging from AR11166 with its
location being in a region where the Cowling resistivity is dominant.

On following [37] that examines the role of ambipolar diﬀusion in Sweet-Parker recon-
nection, we ﬁnd a normalized magnetic reconnection rate of 0.12. This value is in agreement
with [38] and the references therein.

We refer the interested reader to [39] for more details.

4 Conclusions

In
We have developed a data-driven MHD model for the weakly-ionized chromosphere.
this paper, we presented an overview of this model and a benchmark case result which
validated the local simulation setup. The partial ionization eﬀects in our model equations
are introduced by the Cowling resistivity which also poses numerical challenges such as the
restriction on the stability condition and hence the convergence speed that we needed to
address.

We also discussed the eﬀects of the Cowling resistivity in the weakly-ionized chromosphere
during the evolution of an AR and on ﬂare formation associated with magnetic reconnection

in the chromosphere.

We analyzed the evolution of AR11166. The Cowling resistivity is found to be orders
of magnitude larger than the Coulomb resistivity, especially between 1-2 Mm height in the
chromosphere. It has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the chromospheric heating via frictional Joule
heating due to current dissipation perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The time-dependent
evolution of Cowling resistivity gives an indication about the evolution of the AR as well
since it follows the AR structure quite closely due to its strong dependence on the magnetic
ﬁeld strength.

We also analyzed the eﬀect of Cowling resistivity on the formation of a C2.0 ﬂare that
emerged from AR11166. The Cowling resistivity can have an eﬀect on ﬂare formation for a
low-lying 3D null point conﬁguration that occurs at a height of ∼1.9 Mm where the Cowling
resistivity has its largest value. We obtained a normalized magnetic reconnection rate of
0.12 which is in agreement with [38] and the references therein. We also found a good match
between the AIA brightening with the log Q contours and the location of the null point
inferred from the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld topology.

In a future work, we will perform a numerical simulation of the evolution of AR11166

using our model and compare with the results in this paper.
