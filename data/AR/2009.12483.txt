ABSTRACT

Long-lasting activity complexes (ACs), characterised as a series of closely located, continuously
emerging solar active regions (ARs), are considered generating prominent poleward surges from ob-
servations. The surges lead to signiﬁcant variations of the polar ﬁeld, which are important for the
modulation of solar cycles. We aim to study a prominent poleward surge during solar cycle 24 on the
southern hemisphere, and analyse its originating ACs and the eﬀect on the polar ﬁeld evolution. We
automatically identify and characterize ARs based on synoptic magnetograms from the Solar Dynamic
Observatory. We assimilate these ARs with realistic magnetic conﬁguration into a surface ﬂux trans-
port model, and simulate the creation and migration of the surge. Our simulations well reproduce the
characteristics of the surge and show that the prominent surge is mainly caused by the ARs belonging
to two ACs during Carrington Rotations 2145-2159 (December 2013-January 2015). The surge has
a strong inﬂuence on the polar ﬁeld evolution of the southern hemisphere during the latter half of
cycle 24. Without the about one-year-long ﬂux emergence in the form of ACs, the polar ﬁeld around
the cycle minimum would have remained at a low level and even reversed to the polarity at cycle 23
minimum. Our study also shows that the long-lived unipolar regions due to the decay of the earlier
emerging ARs cause an intrinsic diﬃculty of automatically identifying and precisely quantifying later
emerging ARs in ACs.

1. INTRODUCTION

The spatial and temporal proximity of active regions (ARs) on the Sun is an important feature of large-scale
solar magnetism (van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 1992; Harvey & Zwaan 1993). A sequence of closely located, continuously
emerging ARs is deﬁned as a complex of activity (Gaizauskas et al. 1983), or activity complex (AC). This deﬁnition
agrees with the concept of “sunspot nests” (see Castenmiller et al. 1986), which last for several rotations and contain
over 30% ARs in total. ACs can also be associated with “active longitudes”, which date back to Carrington (1858).
Consequently, ACs are foci of Sun’s toroidal magnetic ﬁelds, and an indicator of solar cycle development (Yazev 2015).
The nesting tendency of ARs and physical interpretations are discussed in the review of van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green
(2015).

The decay of ARs over the solar surface determines the evolution of the large-scale ﬁeld, including the polar ﬁeld.
According to the Babcock-Leighton (B-L) mechanism (Babcock 1961; Leighton 1964, 1969), the surface large-scale
ﬁeld corresponds to the surface poloidal ﬁeld of the dynamo loop and serves as the seed of the subsequent cycle
(Cameron & Sch¨ussler 2015; Wang 2017; Jiang et al. 2018; Petrovay 2020). The polar ﬁeld is also the source of the
fast solar wind (Tu et al. 2005) and the interplanetary ﬁeld (Balogh et al. 1995; Jiang et al. 2010), which modulates
the density of cosmic rays (Cane et al. 1999; Potgieter 2013). Considering the continuous ﬂux emergence in ACs, the
decay of ACs is possible to introduce strong variations to the surface large-scale ﬁeld, and is supposed to be a cause
of short-term variation and perturbation of the interplanetary ﬁeld. Thus it is important to investigate the evolution
of ARs within ACs and its inﬂuence on the large-scale ﬁeld.

The migration of ARs on the surface can be described by the surface ﬂux transport (SFT) model (e.g. DeVore et al.
1985; Wang et al. 1989; van Ballegooijen et al. 1998; Mackay et al. 2002; Jiang et al. 2014). The SFT model utilizes
a set of transport parameters based on observations and estimations to solve the magnetic induction equation on
the surface, with the source of surface magnetic ﬂux coming from emerging ﬂux in ARs. The SFT model is able to
reproduce the polar ﬁeld evolution. Early SFT simulations use the bipolar magnetic region (BMR) approximation as
the source term. Wang et al. (1989) analysed the evolution of BMRs by comparing SFT simulations with observational
longitudinally averaged surface ﬁeld during cycle 21, and found how the trailing polarity ﬂux of BMRs built up the
polar ﬁeld. Cameron et al. (2010) used BMRs constructed from observations in the SFT model to reproduce the solar
open ﬂux and polar ﬁeld of cycles 15-21.

Recently, more SFT simulations have begun to use real conﬁgurations instead of the BMR approximation as source
terms (e.g. Yeates et al. 2015; Virtanen et al. 2017; Whitbread et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2019). Using real conﬁguration
of ARs is more precise in terms of polar ﬁeld inﬂuence than using BMRs constructed from AR parameters, especially
for more complex ones like δ-type ARs (Jiang et al. 2019). The ﬁnal dipole moment could deviate from or even be
opposite to that determined by tilt angle and other AR parameters. Therefore, using real conﬁgurations of ARs is
necessary as we aim to simulate ARs emerging during a few Carrington Rotations (CRs) in detail.

The poleward migration of ﬂux is not uniform in time, but usually in the form of poleward surges (or poleward
ﬂux streams, plumes) seen on magnetic butterﬂy diagrams, i.e., longitudinally averaged radial magnetic ﬁeld at the
photosphere (Howard & Labonte 1981). Poleward surges’ characteristics are related to originating ARs, whose axes
have tilts respect to the east-west direction. Typically, a tilted bipolar AR generates a poleward surge of the trailing
polarity. This results from the latitudinal separation of the two polarities because of the tilt angle, which leads to
a more diﬀusive, less distinguishable poleward migration of the leading polarity (Mackay et al. 2002; Yeates et al.
2015; Sun et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2019). Surges are more concentrated if originating from higher latitudes, and more
diﬀusive if originating from lower latitudes. The concentrated surges correspond to a short-term perturbation in the
polar ﬁeld by ARs. On the other hand, ARs’ inﬂuences on the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld, i.e., the polar ﬁeld at cycle minimum,
decrease exponentially as their emergence latitudes increase, as revealed by the SFT simulations of Jiang et al. (2014);
Whitbread et al. (2018), and by a mathematical explanation of Petrovay et al. (2020). Hence, a surge with long-
lasting inﬂuence to the solar cycle development should originate from lower latitudes, especially with concentrated ﬂux
emergence, e.g., ACs.

Meanwhile, observations suggest the relation among ACs, the generated poleward surges, and the polar ﬁeld rever-
sal (Mordvinov et al. 2016; Mordvinov & Kitchatinov 2019). ARs with diﬀerent tilt angles in ACs may form large
regions of single polarity as a result of ﬂux cancellation between them, and create poleward surges (Gaizauskas 2008).
Comparison of polar ﬁeld reversal of cycles 21-24 shows that ACs with larger area and longer lifetime are associated
with stronger poleward surges and more violent polar ﬁeld reversal (Petrie & Ettinger 2017). This, however, was done
by stacking synoptic maps, as Gaizauskas et al. (1983) did, and by measuring observational magnetic ﬂux at diﬀerent
latitudes, but no SFT simulations were applied.
It is needed to tell whether such long-lasting ACs that are able
to cause violent polar ﬁeld variation can have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld as well. The relationship
between poleward surges by ACs and their polar ﬁeld inﬂuence should be evaluated in the data-driven SFT model to
tell the exact long-term inﬂuence of ACs.

To learn the contribution of ACs to poleward surges and the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld, we simulate the production and
migration of the most prominent poleward surge on the southern hemisphere during cycle 24. As shown in Figure
1, the surge of interest covers the time period of CRs 2145-2159 (DEC 2013-JAN 2015), carrying a large quantity
of negative ﬂux that reversed the polar ﬁeld from positive to negative and further strengthened the ﬁeld to -4 G on
average. The surge of interest originates from long-lasting ACs, which will be shown in Subsection 2.2. We simulate
the overall development of the surge by assimilating the ARs with their real conﬁgurations during CRs 2145-2159 into
SFT simulations, and compare them with observations. Our simulation is able to reproduce the features of the surge,
especially its dominant inﬂuence on the southern polar ﬁeld. We present the simulation of a fraction of the ACs in
detail, discussing the continuous ﬂux emergence and cancellation occurring in ACs, in order to examine and discuss
the associated intrinsic diﬃculty of automatic AR identiﬁcation in ACs.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the AR identiﬁcation method based on synoptic maps.
We then show the identiﬁed ARs and describe the ACs. In Section 3 we introduce the data driven SFT model that
we use, and the assimilation technique of identiﬁed ARs. In Section 4 we present simulation results for the surge. We
discuss and conclude in Section 5.

2. ARS DURING CRS 2145-2159

2.1. Method of identifying ARs

To obtain the input source term for the SFT model, an AR identiﬁcation method is needed. Up to now, identiﬁcation
of ARs for the source term of the SFT model has been done by smoothing the magnetograms and applying a threshold,
as done by Yeates et al. (2015); Virtanen et al. (2017); Whitbread et al. (2017, 2018). The threshold is determined
by trial and optimization methods over a given cycle. However, as we aim to examine the properties of ACs within a
shorter period of time than the whole cycle, where ﬂux of diﬀerent strengths and concentrations is mixed as a result
of continuous emergence, one threshold is not suﬃcient to obtain the needed AR properties. Instead, we apply an
identiﬁcation method with the ability of morphological analysis to adapt to the complex environment in ACs.

AR data are obtained from synoptic maps of radial magnetic ﬁeld component from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI) (Schou et al. 2012). The radial ﬁeld component is derived from HMI line-
of-sight 720 sec-cadence magnetograms by dividing cosine latitude. The synoptic maps have a size of 3600×1440 pixels,
with equal space in longitude and equal space in sine-latitude. We choose the polar ﬁeld interpolated version created
by the method of Sun et al. (2011); Sun (2018).

We use the AR identiﬁcation method of Zhang et al. (2010) to obtain the ARs needed for the SFT model input.
The method is originally created for MDI magnetograms, and is adapted to the HMI data in this study. In order to
carry out the morphological analysis, the method needs four diﬀerent control parameters: kernel threshold, erosion
size, growth threshold, and dilation size. The method selects regions with strength larger than the kernel threshold
and area larger than the erosion size as kernels. The kernels are grown up to the growth threshold. Grown regions
within the dilation size are joined together to connect diﬀerent parts of a single AR. How to choose this set of four
parameters depends on the conditions of synoptic maps and our purpose.

For the majority of the ARs, we use the following set of control parameters: kernel threshold 250 G, erosion size
10 Mm, growth threshold 45 G, and dilation size 10 Mm. The set of parameters has been tested with diﬀerent trials,
and is found to successfully recover most ARs; it is referred to as the standard set. A lower kernel threshold or a
lower erosion size will keep smaller magnetic structures during the identiﬁcation, resulting in more ARs identiﬁed. A
lower growth threshold will result in larger areas of identiﬁed ARs. Here we show the extracted parameters of NOAA
AR12222 on CR2157 as an example, as shown in Table 1. ARs’ area and ﬂux are calculated by summing the values
over all AR pixels. The longitude and latitude of ARs are determined by the geometric center of valid AR pixels
weighted by unsigned ﬂuxes. Tilt angles are calculated from the weighted centers of two polarities. We note that some
identiﬁed regions are not well-balanced in positive and negative ﬂux. We select those ARs that are fairly balanced

 
4

in magnetic ﬂux, which means that the stronger polarity is less than three times that of the weaker polarity, such as
AR12222 listed here. This standard has also been applied to previous SFT simulations (see Virtanen et al. 2017).

The ﬁrst row of Table 1 shows the physical quantities of AR12222 obtained based on the standard set of control
parameters. The second to the fourth rows correspond to the variations of the control parameters by changing the
kernel threshold to 225 G, the growth threshold to 35 G, and the erosion and dilation sizes to 30 Mm, respectively.
As shown, the properties of AR12222 are well kept despite the changes of control parameters. In practice, we accept
a kernel threshold between 225 G and 250 G, an erosion and dilation size between 10 Mm and 20 Mm, and a growth
threshold between 40 G and 50 G.

During the development of ACs, the identiﬁcation of ARs within ACs can be problematic due to the extensive ﬂux
emergence and cancellation. Some ARs are proximate to the unipolar regions generated by previous ACs, and may also
be mixed with new ﬂux emerging near or even within the considered AR. In this case, the AR is composed of a mixture
of stronger and weaker, more concentrated and more diﬀusive ﬂux, and resides in a large area of non-zero background,
which causes an intrinsic diﬃculty for automatic AR identiﬁcation techniques with a given set of control parameters.
The AR with the largest area and longest time of occurrence during the time considered, labelled as NOAA AR12192,
is such an example. As shown in the synoptic maps in Figure 2(a) and 2(b), AR12192 is near a large unipolar region
(in blue color), which originates from previous ARs in an AC. We will simulate the formation of this unipolar region
in Subsection 4.2. The standard set of control parameters is able to identify AR12192 on CR2156. On CR2157, the
recurring AR12192, relabelled as ARs 12209, 12213, and 12214, is mixed with new ﬂux emergence near and within
it. We ﬁnd that the standard set of control parameters is unable to identify AR12192 on CR2157. Consequently we
have to choose a diﬀerent set of control parameters: kernel threshold 100 G, erosion size 10 Mm, growth threshold
20 G, and dilation size 60 Mm, to identify the more diﬀusive AR12192. We refer to this set of control parameters as
the special set. As shown in Figure 2(c) and 2(d), the two conﬁgurations of identiﬁed AR12192 diﬀer vastly. The two
conﬁgurations of AR12192 possess diﬀerent parameters, presented in Table 2. During CRs 2156-2157, AR12192 shows
an increase in area and a decrease in ﬂux, and a notable change in tilt angle. Our SFT simulation tests show that
the evolution of AR12192 during CRs 2156-2157 cannot be achieved by SFT transport terms only. This implies new
ﬂux emergences, as ﬂux emergence is important in changing the properties of AR12192 (McMaken & Petrie 2017).
Such new emergence superposes with existing ﬂux, and cancels with existing opposite polarities. Thus it is expected
that the observed evolution of the AR during CRs 2156-2157 is diﬀerent from the evolution solely deduced from the
previous occurrence of the AR on CR2156. Therefore, we choose the special set of control parameters for processing
AR12192 on CR2157 for the following simulations.

The two sets of control parameters produce diﬀerent results not only for AR12192, but for other ARs as well. We
show the diﬀerence for AR12222 as an example, in the last row of Table 1. As shown in Figure 2(e) and 2(f), when the
special set of control parameters is applied, AR12222 shows a growth in size and ﬂux, as well as a shift in conﬁguration,
for it is connected with other magnetic structures. We note that the parameter set for AR12192 is an extreme case,
and we keep the standard set of control parameters for all other ARs.

Figure 2. Identiﬁed ARs on synoptic maps. The left column shows synoptic maps of CR2156 (a), and CR2157 (b), with the
ARs (enclosed by black curves) identiﬁed by the automatic identiﬁcation method using the standard set of control parameters.
AR12192 and the unipolar region in proximity are indicated with black arrows. The middle and right columns show AR12192
identiﬁed using the standard set of control parameters on CR2156 (c), and identiﬁed using the special set of control parameters
on CR2157 (d), as well as AR12222 identiﬁed using the standard set of control parameters on CR2157 (e), and identiﬁed using
the special set of control parameters on CR2157 (f).

Utilizing the identiﬁcation methods described above, we identiﬁed 84 ARs in total. The time-latitude distribution
is displayed in Figure 3(a). As shown, all identiﬁed ARs reside within ±30◦ latitude in both hemispheres, with the
majority lying between -10◦ to -20◦. The emergence latitudes of ARs do not follow a clear trend, since a relatively
short time of period is considered here. The majority of emerging latitudes are lower than the source of the surge
studied by Yeates et al. (2015), which covers +20◦ to +40◦. We expect the surge we study to produce large ﬁnal polar
ﬁeld inﬂuence.

During CRs 2145-2159, more ARs are identiﬁed in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, in
terms of region counts and total areas. Figure 3(b) and 3(c) show the numbers and total areas of ARs identiﬁed
in both hemispheres on each CR, respectively. The diﬀerence of areas between two hemispheres is larger than that
of region numbers, indicating that the ARs of the southern hemisphere are also generally larger than regions of the
northern hemisphere.

The imbalance of ﬂux in two polarities is common among the identiﬁed ARs. Figure 3(d) shows the total identiﬁed
positive and negative ﬂux of each CR. The diﬀerence between two signs of polarities diﬀers from rotation to rotation.
We note that unbalanced large ARs aﬀect the result of our SFT model simulations.

Among all identiﬁed ARs, some ARs in the southern hemisphere ﬁt the concept of ACs. We identify ACs according
to standards similar to that of Gaizauskas et al. (1983); Petrie & Ettinger (2017). By stacking those identiﬁed regions
in the southern hemisphere rotation by rotation in Figure 4, we see that ARs between 180◦ and 270◦ longitudes belong
to a long lasting AC. This major AC exists from CR2145 to CR2156, and ends as the AR12192 emerges; AR 12192 is
the largest AR in area and the most abundant in ﬂux in solar cycle 24. This AC consists of 18 regions, over 30% of
all ARs in the southern hemisphere. From its rotation-to-rotation development, we can clearly observe the formation
of unipolar magnetic regions, especially the region that exists for several rotations near AR12192. The formation of
such regions is a superposition of ﬂux from several previous ARs emerging around. After one CR from its major
ﬂux emergence, the diﬀusive AR12192 is mixed with the unipolar region, as well as new ﬂux emergence. From this
perspective we consider AR12192 a member of the AC as well. Besides the most long-lasting AC mentioned above,
the ARs between 50◦ and 135◦ during CRs 2145-2149 can also be identiﬁed as an AC, or a nest. The ﬂux from these
ARs also superposes during evolution, forming unipolar regions. In total, approximately 50% of all identiﬁed ARs are
associated with the two ACs.

The SFT model is to solve the radial component of the magnetic induction equation with given diﬀerential rotation,
meridional ﬂow and supergranular diﬀusion at the solar surface to get the temporal evolution of radial magnetic ﬁeld
component. The SFT simulation code is based on Baumann et al. (2004). The code has 360×180 spatial resolution
and a time interval of one day. The spatial component is expanded in terms of spherical harmonics up to the order of
63, in which case the resolution corresponds to the size of supergranulation. The temporal component is solved with
the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method.

The diﬀerential rotation and meridional ﬂow are determined empirically from historic observations. We adopt
the diﬀerential rotation proﬁle of Snodgrass (1983), and the meridional ﬂow of van Ballegooijen et al. (1998). The
meridional ﬂow speed is set to 11 ms−1. The supergranular diﬀusivity is set to 500 km2s−1. The model details are
described in Jiang et al. (2014).

Besides aforementioned time-independent transport processes, inﬂows towards activity belts are another important
process that aﬀects the result of SFT simulations (Haber et al. 2002; Zhao & Kosovichev 2004; Gizon 2004; Jiang et al.
2010; Cameron & Sch¨ussler 2012). Inﬂows aﬀect ﬂux cancellation and the latitudinal separation of polarities of ARs
(Martin-Belda & Cameron 2016). For simulations that implement BMRs into the SFT code, the eﬀect of inﬂows can
be simpliﬁed as a factor that decreases all tilt angles of BMRs (Jiang et al. 2015). For ARs with real conﬁgurations, the
eﬀect of inﬂows would be more complicated. At present we do not include inﬂows in our simulations. To compensate
the eﬀect of inﬂows, we set the supergranular diﬀusivity to 500 km2s−1, larger than the diﬀusivity of Jiang et al.
(2014). Still, inﬂows are expected to take part in the evolution of ACs, as ACs are characterized as a large amount of
ﬂux emergence and interaction in activity belts. The exact eﬀect of inﬂows remains to be discussed.

3.2. Source term

The ARs identiﬁed in Section 2 are assimilated into the simulation. We ﬁrst balance the total ﬂux of each AR by
enlarging the ﬂux of the weaker polarity on each pixel by a same ratio to balance positive and negative ﬂux. This
balancing technique is identical to that of Jiang et al. (2019). Then we convert the ARs from equal sine latitude
to equal latitude, and rescale them to the resolution of the code. The insertion of ARs is done by replacing the
corresponding pixel in the simulation with new values of the ARs. Considering how synoptic maps are generated, the
day of inserting each AR into the simulation is determined by the time when it crosses central meridian.

Theoretically, ARs are intended to be assimilated into the SFT model when they reach the decay phase. ACs
are characterized as intense ﬂux emergence and cancellation, so decaying ARs within ACs may be mixed with new
emerging ﬂux and old ﬂux from previous ARs. The observed ﬂux is a superposition of ﬂux from diﬀerent emerging
sources at diﬀerent stages of evolution, so it is intrinsically hard to determine the exact decaying phase of ARs in an
AC. As shown in Subsection 2.1, the recurring AR12192 on CR2157 has fairly diﬀerent parameters and conﬁguration
from that of AR12192 on CR2156, possibly caused by ﬂux emergence. Hence, we use the conﬁguration of AR12192 on
CR2157, while its previous occurrence is not assimilated. Such issue is a direct result of the identiﬁcation problem in
ACs described in Subsection 2.1, and remains a possible problem for assimilation studies using real ARs.

4.1. The overall properties of the simulated poleward surge

4. RESULTS

In order to simulate the poleward surge of interest, we ﬁrst assimilate all identiﬁed ARs during CRs 2145-2159 (DEC
2013-JAN 2015). We use the synoptic map of CR2144 as the initial magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration, after converting it to
equal latitude along the y-axis and rescaling it to the resolution of the code. The simulation ends at CR2220 (AUG
2019), which was the latest CR with HMI synoptic maps available when the simulation was conducted.

We generate the magnetic butterﬂy diagram for the whole simulated time range to display the simulated surge. We
also demonstrate a butterﬂy diagram of one simulation without the identiﬁed ARs, solving the evolution of the initial
ﬁeld only. They are shown in Figure 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. By comparing the diagrams we can show that the
surge is primarily generated by the ARs in the time period. Without such a surge and the originating ARs emerging
during the year 2014, the polar ﬁeld reversal would not have been achieved. Instead it would remain at a low level,
and even reverse to previous polarities. The validation of our SFT simulation results is presented in the Appendix A.
In the following we present quantitative comparisons between the simulated results and observations.

Polar ﬁelds are obtained by averaging from 60◦ to 75◦ latitudes for both hemispheres. Its evolution during CRs
2145-2220 is shown in Figure 6. Observations (black lines) show that from the middle of 2014 to the end of 2015, the
southern polar ﬁeld quickly rises to maximum from near zero, and then decreases gradually as the ﬂux of the leading

9

polarity from the originating ARs begins reaching the south pole, while the northern polar ﬁeld rises more steadily
and continuously. The simulated polar ﬁeld of the southern hemisphere (red solid line) is close to observations during
the majority of the latter half of cycle 24, though ARs after CR2159 are not assimilated into the simulation. This
indicates that the rise to maximum and decrease from maximum of the southern polar ﬁeld is mostly determined by
the ARs assimilated, while the ARs after CR2159 do not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the southern polar ﬁeld. This
conﬁrms the importance of the ARs during CRs 2145-2159 to the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld, hence to the long-term development
of the solar cycle. According to Jiang et al. (2018); Jiang & Cao (2018), there are large ARs with abnormal tilt close
to the equator during the years 2016 and 2017, weakening the contribution of ARs after CR2159 to the ﬁnal polar
ﬁeld. As a result, the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld at cycle 24 minimum is largely determined by the ARs during CRs 2145-2159.
Without ARs during the time period (blue lines), the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld would be extremely weak, leading to a possible
next Maunder minimum. These ARs keep this from happening, and build up the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld, which has a similar
strength to that of cycle 23. Based on such strength of polar ﬁelds, we expect a moderate cycle 25.

The surge we consider is stronger and more inﬂuential than other poleward ﬂux migrations in the latter half of
cycle 24. We show the observed and simulated ﬁeld strength at diﬀerent latitudes in Figure 7. As shown by the black
curves obtained from observational data, the surge maintains its width of approximately 0.7-1.0 yr until it reaches high
latitudes, that is, -55◦ (Figure 7(e)) to -60◦ (Figure 7(f)). With a strength larger than 3 G, the surge is signiﬁcantly
stronger than following surges, of which the strength does not exceed 1G. For intermediate latitudes that are not close
to the pole (where the net ﬂux does not pile up), like latitudes -35◦ (Figure 7(a)) and -45◦ (Figure 7(b)), we can see
from the black observational curves that the surges after the prominent surge we consider are of diﬀerent signs, so
their inﬂuence on the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld is fairly small. As shown by the red solid curves, our simulation of the surge
of interest maintains its key features, while being not as narrow as the observational surge. The simulated surge at
35◦ is located somewhat away from the center of the observational surge, which is possibly a result of AR assimilation
random error. The initial diﬀerence is, however, reduced by the transport of ﬂux. The magnetic ﬁeld evolution in
the simulation after CR2159, that is, after all AR assimilation, stays close to that of observations. This is similar to
the situation of polar ﬁeld evolution. Thus we can conclude that the surge we consider deﬁnes the major evolution of
magnetic ﬁeld of the southern hemisphere since CR2145.

The surge is primarily generated by ARs within ACs. To show this, we run a simulation with only ARs within the
two ACs described in Subsection 2.2 and CR2144 as the initial ﬁeld. The generated surge by only ARs in the two
ACs is shown as the red dash-dot curves in Figure 7. The resulting surge is fairly close to the overall result of the
surge where all ARs are assimilated, with matching surge strength and width. The ARs in the two ACs generate the
prominent surge, and in turn have a long-lasting inﬂuence on the southern polar ﬁeld during the latter half of cycle
24.

4.2. Evolution characteristics of ARs within ACs

ACs are characterized as consistent ﬂux emergence as well as cancellation, which aﬀects the conﬁguration of surface
ﬂux.
In order to discuss how this feature is simulated in the SFT model, we choose a sequence of ARs between
180◦ and 270◦ longitudes during CRs 2152-2153 of the southern hemisphere to simulate their evolution together. The
parameters of these ARs are shown in Table 3. Most ARs listed in Table 3 have large and positive tilt angles, but with
a wide range of variation. This is expected since statistical studies of tilt angles have shown that tilt angles of ARs have
a large deviation from the Joy’s law (Hale et al. 1919). The scatter of the tilts is regarded as the result of the buﬀeting
by convective turbulence during the rise of ﬂux tubes through the convection zone to form ARs (Weber et al. 2013).
The poleward ﬂux originates from a part of the trailing polarity depending on the tilt angles and latitudes of ARs in
the AC. We note that, among the listed ARs, some are too close to be identiﬁed individually. Hence some identiﬁed
regions may contain more than one NOAA AR, e.g., the pair of ARs 12104 and 12107. We start the simulation without
initial ﬁeld and assimilate the ARs on their corresponding day. The simulation is run for 10 years for the ﬁeld to reach
their ﬁnial state.

During the simulation, opposite polarities of close ARs cancel, which is also seen in observations. Figure 8 shows
the simulated synoptic maps for CRs 2153-2158. In the simulation, a large area of concentrated ﬂux of the leading
polarity, that is, positive polarity is formed at the edge of the AC, as the ﬂux from ARs cancels out. Apparently the
polarities of the same sign from diﬀerent ARs tend to merge into larger area of ﬂux as a result of cancellation between
ARs, similar to the observations of Gaizauskas (2008). Eventually a long-lived unipolar region is formed, and aﬀects
nearby ARs, as described in Subsection 2.1. The unipolar region of positive polarity still resides at low to intermediate

latitudes after CR2156 for several rotations. Hence it exists close to AR12192 as it evolves for a considerably long
time. The extended coexistence of the unipolar region and the diﬀusive AR12192 aﬀects the identiﬁcation of AR12192
and new weak ﬂux emergence, as well as the analysis of the development of AR12192 in the following CRs. In the SFT
model, ARs interact only in the form of cancellation from supergranular diﬀusion. Consequently, the observed process
of gathering same sign polarities and the formation of unipolar regions is mostly a result of ﬂux cancellation. Such
cancellation of ARs is common for ACs, as described in Subsection 2.2, and in the observations of Gaizauskas et al.
(2001) and Gaizauskas (2008).

We present the simulated magnetic butterﬂy diagram shown in Figure 5(c), for assimilating only a part of the ACs.
The butterﬂy diagram shows that the part of ACs assimilated creates a section of the poleward surge of the trailing
polarity. As for the leading polarity, both poleward migration and transequatorial migration occur. This is the typical
evolution for a single AR at intermediate emerging latitudes. After the surge, the large unipolar region of the positive

polarity migrates to both poles, which weakens the southern polar ﬁeld and strengthens the northern polar ﬁeld. The
features of the generated surge can be shown by the red dashed curves in Figure 7. According to the peaks of the
curves, this surge has a relatively stable strength of 0.7-0.8 G, which is roughly a fourth to a third of the overall surge
strength.

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have applied a data-driven SFT model to simulate the formation and evolution of the prominent poleward surge
originating from ARs during CRs 2145-2159 on the southern hemisphere in solar cycle 24. We ﬁnd the strength and
shape of the surge is primarily determined by ARs within the two ACs, which consists of about half the number of all
ARs identiﬁed. Our simulations show that the ARs within the ACs generating the surge have a strong long-term eﬀect
on the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld at cycle minimum, while other surges during the latter half of cycle 24 only have considerably less
eﬀect on the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld. The development of the southern polar ﬁeld of the latter half of cycle 24 is predominantly
shaped by ARs generating the surge. Without the ARs within the ACs generating the prominent surge, the ﬁnal polar
ﬁeld would be less than 1 G, and even reverse to previous polarities. The ARs within the ACs eﬀectively build up the
polar ﬁeld of cycle 24 minimum, thus determining the strength of cycle 25 in the framework of B-L-type dynamos,
instead of entering a next Maunder minimum. The surge we consider is diﬀerent from the surge studied by Yeates et al.
(2015). Our surge is stronger and has longer persistence than the surge studied by Yeates et al. (2015). The ARs
generating our surge mostly lie between -10◦ to -20◦ latitudes, which are lower than that of Yeates et al. (2015)’s,
and our surge has signiﬁcantly larger long-term polar ﬁeld inﬂuence. This is consistent with the relationship between
ARs’ ﬁnal polar ﬁeld contributions and emerging latitudes proposed by Jiang et al. (2014). Since the strength and
long-term polar ﬁeld inﬂuence of the surge is unique to cycle 24, it makes sense to refer to it as a “super surge”, similar
to the idea of super ARs. This feature is a notable supplementary to the AC-surge-polar ﬁeld relationship obtained
from previous observations.

In SFT simulations, ARs within ACs are similar to a single, large AR in terms of surge generation and polar ﬁeld
inﬂuence, as the observed process of ARs’ emergence and cancellation creating large regions of leading and trailing
polarities can be simulated by SFT processes. For large ARs with large latitude coverage, the long-term polar ﬁeld
inﬂuence is focused on the ﬂux located around lower latitudes. Thus it may deviate from estimations given by overall
AR parameters. The concept was ﬁrst proposed by Jiang et al. (2019) based on the evolution of a βγδ type AR. The
eﬀect of size asymmetry for two polarities of BMR type ARs examined in Iijima et al. (2019) is also consistent with
this concept. ACs and ARs with large latitude coverage can contribute to both surge and polar ﬁeld, and it is likely
that the surge is not followed by prominent surge of the other polarity. Such a surge can be regarded as the cause of
long-term polar ﬁeld change.

Even for surges causing long-term polar ﬁeld change, the contributed magnetic ﬂux to the ﬁnal polar ﬁeld consists
of only a very small part of originating ARs’ total ﬂux. The percentage depends on the tilt angle and latitude of the
ARs. The AR ﬂux decreases monotonically as a result of diﬀusive cancellation at the neutral line. Poleward ﬂuxes
from separate ARs still cancel in the polar caps if they have diﬀerent polarities. The axial dipole ﬁeld, which results
from AR tilt angles, has the longest lifetime among diﬀerent orders of multipoles (Wang et al. 2000; Baumann et al.

2006). It can survive the SFT process at lower latitudes and contribute to the polar ﬁeld. The ﬁnal polar ﬁeld of a
cycle is determined by the total axial dipole ﬁeld of ARs, including those in ACs, emerged during the cycle, if the
initial ﬁeld and the transport parameters are ﬁxed.

ACs are abundant with intense ﬂux emergence and cancellation. The spatial and temporal proximity of ARs in
ACs is a potential cause of an intrinsic problem of automatically identifying and precisely quantifying ARs in ACs.
The decaying ARs are likely to be mixed with new emerging ﬂux as well as unipolar regions from previous ARs
in ACs. Meanwhile, new ﬂux emergence and associated ﬂux cancellation can alter the conﬁguration of ARs. ACs
are also considered to bear a collective magnetic structure unable to reduce to single ARs (Banin 1983). All these
contribute to the diﬃculty of automatically identifying and assimilating ARs within ACs. For the formation of unipolar
regions in simulations, we note that ﬂux cancellation in SFT simulations is rather simple, not completely realistic.
The removal of ﬂux on the solar surface includes small-scale diﬀusions and large-scale retraction of ﬂux and U-loops
(van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 1992). The importance of large-scale retraction of ﬂux and U-loops on removal of ﬂux still
needs to be examined.

Our simulations do not include inﬂows toward activity belts, but these are expected to take part in ACs. The
strength of inﬂows is dependent on the ﬂux concentration in activity belts due to temperature deﬁcit (Spruit 2003;

 
14

Gizon & Rempel 2008; Cameron & Sch¨ussler 2010). So it aﬀects ACs, as ACs’ emergence is related to the cycle
strength. A detailed examination of inﬂows on ACs is needed for future SFT simulations.

Our assimilation method for ARs with real conﬁgurations is able to produce reliable poleward surge and polar ﬁeld
evolution. However, its accuracy for single ARs is still limited. The two polarities of identiﬁed ARs are not balanced,
and this imbalance is not totally eliminated by our procedure of enlarging the weaker polarity. Observationally ARs
are not balanced in positive and negative polarity, as the trailing polarity may be more diﬀusive so that some ﬂux may
remain undetected by observations. Meanwhile, ARs’ magnetic ﬁeld may be connected to other magnetic features.
Besides these observational limitations, resizing magnetograms might also be possible source of extra imbalance. This
imbalance is required to be dealt with in future simulations.

APPENDIX

A. VALIDATING THE SFT SIMULATION RESULTS

In order to examine the reliability of the SFT simulation results, we introduce two methods of validating the SFT

simulations.

One method is to compare the one year evolution of the simulated polar ﬁeld with observations. If the initial ﬁeld and
the transport terms were ideal, the SFT simulated polar ﬁeld would be comparable to observations for approximately
a year. This is because that the variation of the polar ﬁeld is due to the magnetic ﬂux originated from the activity
It takes a few years for the ﬂux to be transported to the poles. The red and blue lines in Figure 6, which
belt.
are represented in Appendix as Figure 9, are results of the simulations starting from CR2144 with and without ARs
assimilated, respectively. In both cases, we ﬁnd that they are consistent with observational data from HMI synoptic
maps (black lines) for about 1 year since CR2145. Apart from these simulations described already in Subsection 4.1,
we introduce another simulation with the initial ﬁeld set as CR2159 and without ARs assimilated (orange lines in
Figure 9). Its polar ﬁeld evolutions also ﬁt the standard of the method. These results show that the transport terms
in the SFT model are generally reliable.

The other validation is to compare two SFT simulations starting at diﬀerent CRs while ending at the same CR. Still
if the initial ﬁeld and the transport terms were ideal, the two SFT simulations would strictly follow each other during
the overlapped time period. Here we compare the two simulations starting at CR2144 and CR2159, respectively. We
verify the consistency of the surface ﬁeld’s development from CR2159 to the end of the simulations. We ﬁnd from
Figure 9 that the red lines (starting at CR2144) and the orange lines (starting at CR2159) are fairly comparable. This
result further supports the reliability of the transport terms in the SFT model. The result also shows that the AR
identiﬁcation and assimilation methods that we apply during CRs 2145-2159 produce source terms that are close to
the realistic ﬂux emergence. The results of the two methods conﬁrm the reliability of our simulation results.

Figure 9. Validations of the SFT simulations. Black, red, and blue lines are the same as that in Figure 6, but for comparisons
of the ﬁrst-year evolution between simulations (red and blue lines) and observations (black lines). The orange lines represent
the results of the simulation with initial ﬁeld CR2159 and without ARs assimilated.
