AR SCO: A PRECESSING WHITE DWARF SYNCHRONAR?

Draft version September 21, 2021

ABSTRACT
The emission of the white dwarf-M dwarf binary AR Sco is driven by the rapid synchronization of
its white dwarf, rather than by accretion. Synchronization requires a magnetic ﬁeld ∼ 100 gauss at
the M dwarf and ∼ 108 gauss on the white dwarf, larger than the ﬁelds of most intermediate polars
but within the range of ﬁelds of known magnetic white dwarfs. The spindown power is dissipated
in the atmosphere of the M dwarf, within the near zone of the rotating white dwarf’s ﬁeld, by
magnetic reconnection, accelerating particles that produce the observed synchrotron radiation. The
displacement of the optical maximum from conjunction may be explained either by dissipation in
a bow wave as the white dwarf’s magnetic ﬁeld sweeps past the M dwarf or by a misaligned white
dwarf rotation axis and oblique magnetic moment. In the latter case the rotation axis precesses with
a period of decades, predicting a drift in the orbital phase of maximum. Binaries whose emission is
powered by synchronization may be termed synchronars, in analogy to magnetars.

INTRODUCTION
Marsh, et al. (2016); Buckley, et al. (2016) recently
discovered that AR Sco is a M dwarf/white dwarf binary
with an orbital period of 3.56 h and a white dwarf spin
period of 1.95 m. The white dwarf’s spin is slowing with
a characteristic time P/ ˙P = 0.9 × 107 y. Most of the
radiated power is emitted from the M dwarf near the
L1 inner Lagrange point, but the phase of maximum is
displaced from conjunction by about 0.15 of the orbit.

AR Sco emits X-rays but they are only a small frac-
tion of the system’s luminosity, implying that it is not
powered by accretion. Spindown is the remaining plausi-
ble source of energy, with a power −Iω ˙ω, where I is the
white dwarf’s moment of inertia and ω its rotation rate1.
The spindown power is converted to radiation with eﬃ-
ciency several times the 2–3% of 4π sterad subtended
at the white dwarf by its companion. This excludes re-
processing of roughly isotropic radiation from the white
dwarf as the source of the observed radiation.

I follow Marsh, et al. (2016) in assuming the white
dwarf’s rotational energy is dissipated by interaction of
its magnetic ﬁeld with the M dwarf’s atmosphere. The
spectral energy distribution and polarization (Buckley,
et al. 2016) indicate a substantial contribution of syn-
chrotron radiation, implying that the dissipation is by
nonthermal processes, such as magnetic reconnection,
that accelerate energetic particles.

The rapid spindown suggests that AR Sco may be a
missing link between synchronously rotating polars (AM
Her stars) whose synchronism is maintained by magne-
tostatic interaction (Joss, Katz & Rappaport 1979) to
extreme accuracy (Katz 1989) and the asynchronous in-

1 Properly, ω is the WD rotation rate in a rotating frame in
which the total angular momentum of the binary is zero. To an
excellent approximation, this is the frame rotating at the orbital
rate, in which the WD spin rate is about 1% less than in an inertial
frame. The observed optical modulation is at this lower frequency.

termediate polars (IP). Because AR Sco is still far from
synchronism the rate of dissipation of its white dwarf’s
rotational energy is much greater than that in almost-
synchronous systems like V1500 Cyg (Katz 1991a,b).

The visible brightness of AR Sco does not peak at con-
junction (orbital phase φ = 0.5), when we might expect
to see the heated side of the M dwarf most fully, but
rather around phase φ ≈ 0.35. The purpose of this paper
is to investigate the origin of this surprising observation.
I consider two hypotheses:

1. The power dissipated by interaction between the
white dwarf’s magnetic ﬁeld and the M dwarf is
greater on the latter’s leading face where a bow
wave may form (Fig. 1) than on its trailing face.
The dissipation rate does not depend on orbital
phase but we view the hottest portion of the M
star more fully before conjunction.

2. The white dwarf’s spin axis is not aligned with the
orbital axis and its magnetic moment is not aligned
with its spin axis. The dissipation rate in the M
dwarf’s atmosphere depends on the orbital phase
(Fig. 2). Precession of the spin axis makes the or-
bital phase of maximum drift.

In either hypothesis the optical maximum is displaced
from conjunction. In the ﬁrst hypothesis it precedes con-
junction if the white dwarf spin is prograde (and follows
it if retrograde). In the second hypothesis any phase is
possible, but precession makes it recede (if the spin is
prograde).

Geng, Zhang & Huang (2016) and Buckley, et al.
(2016) have suggested that the white dwarf acts as a
pulsar. But the M dwarf is well within the near zone of
the white dwarf’s dipole radiation ﬁeld, where the non-
radiative Poynting vector exceeds the radiative Poynting
vector by O(c/aω)4 ∼ 103–104. Marsh, et al. (2016) also
pointed out the diﬃculty of coupling an estimated 9%

Figure 2. The white dwarf’s spin (cid:126)ω makes an angle (cid:15) with the
orbital axis, and the spin axis precesses. If the magnetic moment is
oblique (shown here as perpendicular) to the spin axis, as indicated
by the large amplitude modulation at the sideband of the spin
frequency, the magnetic ﬁeld is maximum in a broad fan, indicated
by dashed lines, around the rotational equator, and dissipation
is maximum at orbital phases when the M dwarf (shown at three
orbital phases) is in that fan. In the Figure that occurs at φ ≈ 0.35
and φ ≈ 0.85 (at φ ≈ 0.85 the heated surface is not visible to the
observer).

Numerical evaluation (Table 1) yields ﬁelds > 109 G.
These are outside the range of observed white dwarf ﬁelds
and therefore implausible.

If the spin-down power is dissipated magnetically in
the M dwarf’s atmosphere the implied ﬁeld is readily, but
roughly, estimated. Because the parameter aω/c ≈ 0.15–
0.20 is not very small, the quasi-static approximation
(Joss, Katz & Rappaport 1979) is inexact and the ﬁeld
on the M dwarf’s leading (with respect to the rotating
magnetic ﬁeld) face may be substantially greater than
that on its trailing face. The resulting torque

Figure 1. The white dwarf’s ﬁeld is moving past the M dwarf
at a speed aω, where a is the separation of the stars. This is fast
enough (15–20% of c) to induce an asymmetry in the magnetic in-
teraction between the “upstream” and “downstream” faces of the
M dwarf, even though there is not expected to be a particle wind
from the white dwarf. The white dwarf’s magnetic ﬁeld is an elec-
tromagnetic wind, even inside the radiation zone (though not deep
in the near zone, close to the white dwarf, where a magnetostatic
treatment should be valid). More energy is released in a bow wave
on the upstream side. The Figure shows a magnetic moment mis-
aligned with the white dwarf’s spin axis, but this is not necessary;
an upstream/downstream asymmetry and a torque would occur

of the spin-down power, if radiated, to a M dwarf that
occupies only 2–3% of the white dwarf’s sky. This again
argues against mechanisms that radiate the energy in a
broad beam, such as that of a rotating dipole, and indi-
cates non-radiative coupling.

I therefore attribute the dissipation to the interaction
of the white dwarf’s quasi-static vacuum magnetic ﬁeld
with the M dwarf’s atmosphere. This interaction and the
dissipation rate vary with orbital phase, shifting maxi-
mum light from conjunction, even if the white dwarf’s
rotation and magnetic axes are aligned (that alignment
is excluded in AR Sco because of the large amplitude
modulation at the sideband of the spin period). The
irregularly ﬂuctuating brightness near the orbital phase
of maximum may be attributed to the magnetic storms
characteristic of magnetic reconnection.

2. MAGNETIC FIELDS
The hypothesis that the white dwarf is spinning down
as a rotating magnetic dipole in vacuum (Geng, Zhang
& Huang 2016; Buckley, et al. 2016) requires magnetic
ﬁelds greater than known white dwarf ﬁelds. Equat-

A number of these parameters, especially I, are uncer-

(Marsh, et al. 2016) I varies by an order of magnitude;
Table 2), but these ﬁelds are plausible. They point to an
unusually (for a polar; Warner (1995)), but not extraor-
dinarily, magnetized white dwarf in AR Sco, consistent
with its rapid spindown and high rate of dissipation of
rotational energy.

can be constrained from the mass function and the up-
per bound on white dwarf masses. The mass function

4. THE ORBITAL PHASE OF MAXIMUM
There are two distinct explanations of the fact that the
optical maximum of AR Sco does not occur at conjunc-
tion, in contrast to expectation for a classic reﬂection
eﬀect.

4.1. Magnetic Bow Wave
If the white dwarf were rotating slowly enough then
a magnetostatic treatment of its interaction with the M
dwarf (Joss, Katz & Rappaport 1979) would be valid.
There would still be dissipation (Katz 1989, 1991a,b),
likely enhanced by turbulent (rather than just Ohmic)
resistivity, but there would be symmetry between the
leading and trailing faces of the M dwarf and maximum
light would occur at conjunction.

In AR Sco the parameter ωa/c ≈ 0.15/ sin i is in the
range 0.15–0.20, large enough to distinguish the mag-
netic interaction between leading and trailing faces of
the M dwarf (Fig. 2) and to describe them as bow wave
and wake. Unlike the Solar wind, there is no material
wind from the white dwarf, only a vacuum electromag-
netic ﬁeld that cannot be completely described by the
magnetostatic near zone regime, although it is well in-
side (by a factor of 5–7) the speed of light cylinder and
the radiation zone.

4.2. Precession
If the white dwarf’s spin axis is not parallel to the or-
bital axis the magnetic ﬁeld at the M dwarf, and there-
fore the rate of dissipation, will vary with orbital phase.
This provides a possible explanation for the fact that the
optical maximum does not occur at orbital phase 0.5,
as it would for a classical reﬂection eﬀect. A simpliﬁed
possible geometry is shown in Fig. 2, in which the mag-
netic axis is assumed to be perpendicular to the rotation
axis. The maximum magnetic ﬁeld, along the magnetic
poles of the white dwarf, then sweeps out the rotational
equatorial plane of the white dwarf.

The M dwarf crosses this plane twice per orbit. If the
dissipation rate varies with the magnetic ﬁeld this would
introduce a dependence on orbital phase. The observed
intensity would then be the result of a convolution of this
orbital phase dependence of the dissipation rate with the
orbital phase dependence of the visibility of the heated
face of the M dwarf. An analogous result follows for any
dependence of dissipation on the ﬁeld (for example, the
˙(cid:126)B or ∝ (cid:126)J · (cid:126)E ∝ ˙B2,
dissipation might vary ∝ (cid:126)B · (cid:126)E ∝ (cid:126)B ·
where Maxwell’s equations imply E ∝ ˙B.).

If the white dwarf’s spin axis makes an angle (cid:15) with the
orbital axis, the spin axis will precess, causing the optical
maximum to drift in orbital phase. This might explain
the scatter Marsh, et al. (2016) of brightness of AR Sco at
orbital phases 0.25–0.4, if the spin axis precessed during
the period of photometric observations. The precession
rate is

tabulated value.

Table 3
Precession periods of white dwarf spin in AR Sco for various
white dwarf masses. In all cases the M dwarf is assumed to have
a mass MM = 0.3M(cid:12); the precession periods are roughly
inversely proportional to MM over its plausible range
0.2M(cid:12) (cid:47) MM (cid:47) 0.4M(cid:12). MW D < 0.81M(cid:12) is excluded (Marsh, et
al. 2016).

Numerical results for AR Sco are shown in Table 3. The
implied precession periods are in the approximate range
20–200 y, and are short enough that if precession is oc-
curring it should be apparent in a decade of data (for
the longest periods) and perhaps in one or a few years
(for the shortest periods). The condition sin i ≤ 1 sets a
lower bound of about 0.81 M(cid:12) on MW D (Marsh, et al.
2016), so that the properties of lower mass white dwarfs
shown in Table 2 are not relevant to AR Sco.

5. DISCUSSION
The remarkable properties of AR Sco support the sug-
gestion of Marsh, et al. (2016) that it diﬀers from most
intermediate polars in that it is powered by synchroniza-
tion of the white dwarf spin with the orbital motion (a
“synchronar”) rather than by accretion. The displace-
ment of the optical maximum from conjunction implies
that energy is deposited asymmetrically on the surface
of the M dwarf. This may be explained either as a conse-
quence of the subrelativistic phase speed of the rotating
white dwarf magnetosphere at the M dwarf or of a white
dwarf spin axis that is oblique to the orbital axis.
In
the former hypothesis the orbital phase of maximum is
likely to be ﬁxed; in the latter hypothesis the spin axis
precesses with a period of decades, producing a drift in
the orbital phase of maximum.

In at least one other IP, AE Aqr (Ikhsanov & Beskrov-
naya 2008; Mauche 2009), synchronization is also the
chief source of energy and radio emission indicates par-
ticle acceleration. The photometry of AE Aqr is com-
plicated by its ﬂaring, but the amplitude of the periodic

modulation is low and is explicable as an ellipsoidal vari-
ation without evidence of a reﬂection eﬀect or other in-
teraction with the white dwarf (van Paradijs, Kraakman
& van Amerongen, S. 1989; Bruch 1991). The secondary
star of AE Aqr is of earlier spectral type (K4V) than
that of AR Sco (M5V) and likely intrinsically more lu-
minous, reducing the eﬀect of magnetic heating on the
light curve. AR Sco and AE Aqr may be members of a
class of synchronars, magnetic binaries whose emission is
powered by the synchronization of their compact (white
dwarf) asynchronously rotating components. AR Sco is
an extreme example in which the contribution of intrinsic
stellar and accretional luminosity is particularly small.

Accretion contributes only a small fraction, perhaps
none, of the luminosity of AR Sco. This is likely at-
tributable to its strongly magnetized white dwarf. AR
Sco also diﬀers from non-accreting binary (neutron star)
pulsars with nondegenerate companions because the bi-
nary pulsars’ companions are in the radiation zones of
the fast-spinning pulsars’ magnetic ﬁelds, so any interac-
tion between the companion and the ﬁeld does not cou-
ple back to the pulsars’ rotation. In such a system pulsar
spin energy may be deposited in the companion, but the
pulsar radiates in a broad dipole pattern. This limits
the coupling eﬃciency to no more than twice the com-
panion’s subtended solid angle at the pulsar, inconsistent
with observations of AR Sco, and the pulsar despins as
would an isolated object. In contrast, in AR Sco the cou-
pling is near-zone, though not quite quasi-static, rather
than radiative. Its eﬃciency is not limited by the sub-
tended solid angle and, as in a well-designed transformer,
can approach 100%.
