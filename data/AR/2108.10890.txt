ABSTRACT

We investigate radiation hardness within a representative sample of 67 nearby
(0.02 (cid:46) z (cid:46) 0.06) star-forming (SF) galaxies using the integral ﬁeld spectroscopic data
from the MaNGA survey. The softness parameter 𝜂 = 𝑂+/𝑂2+
is sensitive to the spectral energy
𝑆+/𝑆2+
distribution of the ionizing radiation. We study 𝜂 via the observable quantity 𝜂(cid:48) (= [𝑂ii]/[𝑂iii]
)
[𝑆ii] [𝑆iii]
We analyse the relation between radiation hardness (traced by 𝜂 and 𝜂(cid:48)) and diagnostics
sensitive to gas-phase metallicity, electron temperature, density, ionization parameter, eﬀective
temperature and age of ionizing populations. It is evident that low metallicity is accompanied
by low log 𝜂(cid:48), i.e. hard radiation ﬁeld. No direct relation is found between radiation hardness
and other nebular parameters though such relations can not be ruled out. We provide empirical
relations between log 𝜂 and strong emission line ratios N2, O3N2 and Ar3O3 which will allow
future studies of radiation hardness in SF galaxies where weak auroral lines are undetected. We
compare the variation of [O iii]/[O ii] and [S iii]/[S ii] for MaNGA data with SF galaxies and
H ii regions within spiral galaxies from literature, and ﬁnd that the similarity and diﬀerences
between diﬀerent data set is mainly due to the metallicity. We ﬁnd that predictions from
photoionizaion models considering young and evolved stellar populations as ionizing sources in
good agreement with the MaNGA data. This comparison also suggests that hard radiation ﬁelds
from hot and old low-mass stars within or around SF regions might signiﬁcantly contribute to
the observed 𝜂 values.

INTRODUCTION

star-forming galaxies

An in-depth analysis of
the
characterisation of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies, which
constitutes matter and radiation ﬁeld. While the matter is composed
of gas and dust, the radiation is produced by both stars and the
interstellar matter. The hardness and intensity of radiation ﬁeld
are the fundamental parameters which aﬀect the overall shape of
the spectrum of a region consisting of stars and ionized gas. The
hardness of ionizing radiation ﬁeld has been studied via diﬀerent
deﬁnitions in diﬀerent works (e.g. Vilchez & Pagel 1988; Morisset

et al. 2016; Nakajima et al. 2018; Pérez-Montero et al. 2020).
More fundamentally, radiation hardness is the shape of the spectral
energy distribution (SED) or the slope of the extreme ultraviolet
spectrum (see e.g. Kewley et al. 2015; Nakajima et al. 2018) and
hence can be probed by the eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ) of stars
producing ionizing photons (e.g. Vilchez & Pagel 1988; Steidel
et al. 2014). The ratio of photons capable of ionizing neutral
hydrogen (H0) and helium (He0), i.e. Q0/1 is also used to probe
radiation hardness (Morisset et al. 2016). In photoionization models,
it is assumed that radiation hardness (parameterized by Teﬀ or

stellar population distribution and age), ionization parameter U1
and chemical abundance of ionized gas are independent quantities
which aﬀect the output spectrum of a photoionized nebulae. Steidel
et al. (2014) states that the more generalized form of ionization
parameter Γ2, depends on radiation hardness, because the number
of hydrogen ionizing photons can be changed by changing the shape
or intensity of ionizing radiation (Kewley et al. 2006). Hence, the
hardness of radiation ﬁeld may be related to various parameters such
as initial mass function, age of the stellar population, equivalent
eﬀective temperature, ionization parameter and metallicity, and
can be probed via emission lines emanating from the ionized gas
component of the ISM.

wavelength range (e.g. [O ii] and [O iii]) are widely used to
study the properties of the ISM. However, only a few works have
also explored the use of near-infrared (NIR) CELs such as [S iii]
𝜆𝜆9069, 9532 (see e.g. Vilchez & Pagel 1988; Vilchez & Esteban
1996; Díaz & Pérez-Montero 2000; Stasińska 2006; Pérez-Montero
& Díaz 2005; Pérez-Montero & Vílchez 2009; Fernández et al.
2018; Mingozzi et al. 2020; Pérez-Montero et al. 2020) mainly
due to the following two reasons. First, only a few spectrographs
used in galaxy surveys include useful wavelengths above 9000Å.
Secondly, the NIR wavelength range is strongly aﬀected by telluric
absorption and sky lines thus complicating the analysis of these
sulphur emission lines. Nonetheless, these lines have enormous
potential for determining the characteristic properties of ionized
gas from which they emanate. For example, the emission line ratios
involving [S iii] 𝜆9069, such as S23 = [S iii] 𝜆𝜆9069, 9532 +
[S ii] 𝜆𝜆 6717, 6731)/H𝛽 and S3O3 = [S iii] 𝜆𝜆9069, 9532/[O
iii] 𝜆𝜆4959, 5007 have been proposed as metallicity diagnostics
(see e.g. Díaz & Pérez-Montero 2000; Pérez-Montero & Díaz 2005;
Stasińska 2006). Similarly, the emission line ratios involving sulphur
lines, [S ii] 𝜆𝜆6717, 6731/H𝛼 versus [S iii] 𝜆𝜆9069, 9532/H𝛼
are also proposed to identify the ionization mechanisms in the
Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Regions (LINERs, Diaz et al.
1985). The photoionization models have shown that the line ratio
[S ii] 𝜆𝜆 6717, 6731/[S iii] 𝜆𝜆9069, 9532 is a good indicator of
ionization parameter (Mathis 1985; Diaz et al. 1991; Morisset et al.
2016; Kewley et al. 2019), which is critical in understanding the state
of plasma in an H ii region. Mathis (1982, 1985) further pointed
out the importance of sulphur lines such as [S iii] 𝜆9069, 9532 to
determine the relative temperatures of hot stars within nebulae by
comparing observations with nebular models on the S+/𝑆++ versus
O+/O diagram. Vilchez & Pagel (1988) modiﬁed the procedure from
Mathis (1982) and introduced the so-called softness parameter

𝜂 =

𝑂+/𝑂2+
𝑆+/𝑆2+

.

(1)

𝜂 is sensitive to the spectral energy distribution of the
ionizing radiation because of the large diﬀerence in the ionization
potentials of O+ (35.1 eV) and S+ (23.2 eV) (Bresolin et al. 1999;
Pérez-Montero & Vílchez 2009). However, 𝜂 is not a directly

observable quantity and can be studied via the observable line ratio
𝜂(cid:48) which, in optical, is deﬁned as

.

𝜂(cid:48) =

[𝑂ii]𝜆3727/[𝑂iii]𝜆𝜆4959, 5007
[𝑆ii]𝜆𝜆6717, 6731/[𝑆iii]𝜆𝜆9069, 9532
The mid-infrared ﬁne structure lines of Ne, Ar and S are
also used to determine 𝜂 (see e.g., Martín-Hernández et al. 2002;
Morisset et al. 2004; Pérez-Montero & Vílchez 2009). The softness
parameter 𝜂 is related 𝜂(cid:48) and electron temperature (T𝑒) as proposed
by Vilchez & Pagel (1988). The following revised relation is
obtained using pyneb and its default values for atomic data:

log 𝜂 = log 𝜂(cid:48) +

where t = T𝑒([O iii])/104.

(3)

The 𝜂(cid:48) parameter has been used to study the ionization structure
and the relative hardness of the ionizing sources in the H ii regions
within the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds (Martín-Hernández
et al. 2002; Morisset et al. 2004), in the star-forming galaxies
(Hägele et al. 2006; Kehrig et al. 2006; Hägele et al. 2008;
Pérez-Montero et al. 2020) and the radial variation of the hardness
of the ionizing radiation of H ii regions in the discs of spiral
galaxies (Pérez-Montero & Vílchez 2009; Pérez-Montero et al.
2019). However, it is important to consider other variables while
interpreting 𝜂(cid:48) as radiation hardness. For example, log 𝜂(cid:48) is inversely
proportional to equivalent eﬀective temperature (Teﬀ Kennicutt
et al. 2000), and log 𝜂 can be expressed as a linear function of
1/Teﬀ (Vilchez & Pagel 1988) for a blackbody spectrum. Similarly,
log 𝜂 and log 𝜂(cid:48) may also be related to nebular parameters such
as metallicity (Morisset et al. 2004) and ionization parameter
(Pérez-Montero & Vílchez 2009; Fernández-Martín et al. 2017).
Previous studies of 𝜂 using long-slit or ﬁbre spectra have been
limited to a small number of local (z∼0) galaxies (Hägele et al. 2006,
2008) due to the limitations of spectrographs to reach 𝜆 > 9000 Å.
The data obtained from spectrographs like that of Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) typically cover 3800–9200Å, which cover [S iii]
𝜆9069 up to only a redshift of 0.01 and does not cover [O ii]𝜆3727
required for studying 𝜂(cid:48). In addition, previous long-slit spectra lack
spatially-resolved information. In comparison to global galaxy-scale
analysis, a spatially-resolved investigation provides insight into the
local environment within nebulae. Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS)
is the best available technique to carry out such a study as it allows us
to map various properties encoded in the emission lines emanating
from the ionized gas component of the ISM within galaxies, thus
facilitating studies of correlations between diﬀerent hardness of
radiation ﬁelds and nebular and stellar properties at local scales.
Zinchenko et al. (2019) utilized the IFS data from the Calar Alto
Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA, Sánchez et al. 2012) survey
and performed an indirect study of radiation ﬁeld hardness at
local scales by analysing the relation between equivalent eﬀective
temperature (from [O ii] and [O iii] lines), ionization parameter and
oxygen abundance. Since the [S iii] lines lie beyond the wavelength
range of CALIFA, their lack thereof prevented this study to break the
degeneracy between radiation hardness and the ionization parameter
(see Equation 2). Moreover, the results of Zinchenko et al. (2019)
are derived and hence applicable to a restrictive sample of H ii
regions within spiral galaxies. The metallicity estimates in their
work are based on strong line methods rather than the robust direct
T𝑒 method because the CALIFA survey is not sensitive enough to
detect the weak auroral lines within high-metallicity environments.
This work is the ﬁrst spatially-resolved study of 𝜂 and 𝜂(cid:48) on

a large sample of 67 star-forming galaxies, aimed at understanding
the relation between various nebular parameters and the hardness
of radiation ﬁeld at local scales. In this work, we use data set from
the MaNGA survey to address and overcome the issues faced by
previous surveys and instruments. MaNGA is best-suited for the
current analysis as its wavelength range is wide enough to cover the
sulphur emission lines [S iii] 𝜆𝜆9069, 9532 crucial to this study. The
MaNGA survey also allows us to include relatively low-metallicity
star-forming galaxies which increases our odds to detect and map the
auroral line [O iii] 𝜆4363 enabling us to map T𝑒 and study its relation
with radiation hardness at spatially-resolved scales. Such a detailed
study on radiation hardness within local star-forming galaxies
exhibiting a wide range of ionization conditions, is imperative to
understand various factors which regulate radiation hardness.

The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data
set and the criteria for selecting sample galaxies from the MaNGA
survey. In Section 3, we focus on the relation between [Oiii]/[Oii]
and [Siii]/[Sii] and its dependence on several measurables related
to gas-phase metallicity, age of stellar population and ionization
parameter. In Section 4, we compare our results with the previous
observations and existing photoionization models. We also discuss
the relation between radiation hardness and helium lines in the
handful of galaxies where Heii 4686 are detected. Section 5
summarises our main results. Throughout this study, we use the
following shorthand notation for the strong line ratios for a compact
presentation:

N2 = log([Nii]/H𝛼) = log([Nii]𝜆6584/H𝛼)

We analyse the IFS data of a sample of 67 star-forming
galaxies observed as a part of MaNGA survey (Bundy et al.
2015). Observations were taken with the Baryonic Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) spectrographs (Smee et al. 2013)
on the SDSS 2.5 m telescope (Gunn et al. 2006) at the Apache Point
Observatory (APO). The MaNGA data cover a wavelength range of
3600 Å–10300 Å, have a spectral resolution R ∼ 2000 corresponding
to the instrumental full width half maximum (FWHM) ∼ 70 km
s−1 at the H𝛼 emission line. The reduced data cubes have the
spatial-sampling of 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) and the eﬀective spatial resolution of ∼
2.5(cid:48)(cid:48) FWHM. See Yan et al. (2016) for the Survey design, Law
et al. (2015) for observing strategy and Law et al. (2016) for data
reduction pipeline.

The sample of 67 star-forming (SF) galaxies is a subset of a
larger sample of ∼1400 galaxies in MaNGA data set from Data
Release 14 (DR14)3 which include SF galaxies, Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) and LINERs with reliable [S iii] line detections
in the redshift range of 0.02–0.06 (Amorin et al in prep.). Since
these analyses depend on the use of [S iii] lines, the redshift
cuts are imposed in the parent sample so that at least one of the
two [S iii] 𝜆𝜆9069,9531 lines lie outside the wavelength range of
9300–9700Å which is most aﬀected by a strong telluric absorption
band. To address this issue, we include only those galaxies for which
the emission line ratio [S iii]𝜆9069/9532 have a maximum deviation
of 50% of the theoretical line ratio (=2.5, Fischer et al. 2006) for
all spaxels with signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio > 3.

For the current sample, we deﬁne a galaxy as SF if the emission

Notes: †: MaNGA galaxies with He ii 𝜆4686 detection. ★: MaNGA galaxies with [O iii] 𝜆4363 detection. Stellar Mass is taken from the MaNGA Fireﬂy VAC
(Goddard et al. 2017; Parikh et al. 2018), while rest of the quantities are taken from the Pipe3D VAC.

line ratios of the central 2.5(cid:48)(cid:48) ﬁbre region of the galaxy falls
in the SF region of the classical emission line diagnostic (BPT,
Baldwin et al. 1981) diagram of [O iii]/H𝛽 versus [N ii]/H𝛼.
Figure 1 shows that the emission line ratios estimated from the
central spectrum (2.5(cid:48)(cid:48)/diameter) of galaxy sample follows the SF
sequence lying below the empirical demarcation line of Kauﬀmann
et al. (2003). One galaxy, MaNGA-8626-12704 (also catalogued
as SHOC 579), is an interesting exception which will be useful to
probe more extreme environments. This is a well-known extreme
emission-line galaxy (see e.g. Kniazev et al. 2004; Fernández et al.
2018) which falls slightly above (but still consistent within errors)
the demarcation lines in the BPT diagrams due to its unusually
high ionization properties. Note that similar H ii galaxies with high
excitation and low metallicity, such as the Green Peas (Cardamone
et al. 2009; Amorín et al. 2010) which are known to be local
analogues of high-redshift galaxies, often lie in the upper-left part
of the BPT diagnostics, quite oﬀset with respect to the SF sequence
and sometimes exceeding the demarcations set by photoionization
models (Pérez-Montero & Contini 2009; Feltre et al. 2016; Xiao
et al. 2018).

Table 1 lists general properties of all sample galaxies along
with their plate identiﬁcations as mentioned in the DR14 catalogue
(Sánchez et al. 2016a,b; Sanchez et al. 2018). The sample spans
the stellar mass range of 8.53 (cid:46) log(M★/M(cid:12)) (cid:46) 10.05 , SFR range
of −0.79 (cid:46) log(SFR/M(cid:12)yr−1) (cid:46) 1.30. The equivalent width (EW)
of H𝛼 of the central spectrum of the sample lie in the range of
∼20–1000Å, further ensuring that the galaxies are star-forming. Our
selection criteria is intended to assemble a representative sample
of SDSS-like SF galaxies along the [Nii]-BPT diagram, including
galaxies with reliable spaxel data in all the relevant emission lines.
Note that our sample is not complete by any means. Mingozzi
et al. (2020) presents a larger sample of Manga SFGs with [S iii]
measurements. Figures B1-B3 show the SDSS cutouts of all 67
galaxies in the sample on which hexagonal ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of
MaNGA is overlaid.

2.2 Data

For this work, we use data products included in the MaNGA
DR14 Pipe3D value added catalog (VAC)4 (Sánchez et al. 2016a,b;
Sanchez et al. 2018). Pipe3D is a spectroscopic analysis pipeline
based on a package called fit3d5, and is developed to analyse
the properties of stellar populations and ionized gas via emission
lines in the spatially-resolved optical spectra. In short, this pipeline
performs continuum ﬁtting on binned spaxels of data cubes
using the single stellar population templates from the MIUSCAT
library (Vazdekis et al. 2012) which is an extension of MILES
library (Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006; Vazdekis et al. 2010;
Falcón-Barroso et al. 2011). For analysing strong emission lines,
single Gaussian proﬁles are ﬁt to estimate properties such as
ﬂux intensity, velocity, velocity dispersion and equivalent width.
However, the same properties of weak emission lines is based
on a direct estimation procedure based on a prior estimate of gas
kinematics and Monte Carlo realisations. In addition, stellar indices
such as DN(4000) are also estimated to characterise properties of
stellar populations.

We downloaded data products of sample galaxies from the

links provided on the MaNGA website3. The data products include
data cubes, equivalent width maps and ﬂux maps of emission lines
of interest along with their uncertainty maps. We perform a S/N
cut of 3 on all ﬂux maps for the subsequent analysis. The emission
line ﬂux maps available from Pipe3D are corrected for Galactic
foreground extinction but not for the internal reddening. We use
the extinction curve of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, Fitzpatrick
1986) and theoretical value of Balmer decrement (H𝛼/H𝛽 = 2.86
assuming electron temperature T𝑒 = 104 K and electron density N𝑒 =
100 cm−3, see e.g. Osterbrock & Ferland 2006), to ﬁrst estimate the
colour excess (i.e. E(B−V)) for each galaxy, and then combine with
the observed ﬂux maps of all emission lines of interest to estimate
the extinction-corrected ﬂux maps. A few studies recommend using
the closer Paschen lines for estimating reddening correction for [Siii]
lines (e.g. Pérez-Montero et al. 2019), however, we do not adopt that
methodology because Paschen line maps are not available for this
sample in the DR14 MaNGA data set. We use the intrinsic ﬂux maps
for further analysis except for line ratios with emission lines close
in wavelengths. Uncertainties on these intrinsic maps are estimated
by propagating errors on the observed ﬂux maps, and then on all
quantities of interest, for example, the emission line ratios.

We use theoretical line ratios of [Oiii]𝜆5007/[Oiii]𝜆4959 (=3,
see e.g. Osterbrock & Ferland 2006) and [Siii]𝜆9532/[Siii]𝜆9069
(=2.5, Fischer et al. 2006) to estimate intrinsic ﬂuxes of emission
lines [S iii] 𝜆9069 and [O iii] 𝜆4959 from [S iii] 𝜆9532 and
[O iii] 𝜆5007, respectively. For this work, we prefer to use [S iii]
𝜆9532 instead of [S iii] 𝜆9069 because it has better S/N ratio and
is generally found outside the wavelength regions most aﬀected by
residuals from the telluric absorption correction at the redshift of
this sample. It is worth noting that the continuum ﬁtting performed
for the Pipe3D MaNGA VAC is found to be highly reliable out to
∼9470Å. While [S iii] 𝜆9069 is mostly within that limit, the [S iii]
𝜆9531 is in a wavelength range where the continuum subtraction
relies on an extrapolation of the MIUSCAT models beyond 9470Å.
Thus, the [S iii] 𝜆9531 may in principle be subject of larger
uncertainty. To minimise potential biases, ﬁrst we have checked
that our sample have excellent continuum ﬁtting, i.e. quality ﬂags
𝑄𝐶 𝑓 𝑙𝑎𝑔 = 0 in the Pipe3D catalogs, and second, our sample
selection was constrained to galaxies with spaxel data where the [S
iii]𝜆9069/9532 ratio is consistent within 50% with the theoretical
ratio. Our tests show that for galaxies with spaxel data with S/N([S
iii] 𝜆9531)(cid:38) 10 such consistency is actually better than 15%. Thus,
we estimate the relative uncertainty due to continuum subtraction
issues to be a factor of 1.5 at most. Overall, this translates into
a maximum expected uncertainty of about 0.2 dex for line ratios
involving [S iii].

2.3 Classical and Novel Emission line diagnostic diagrams

We use classical and novel emission line diagnostic diagrams to
verify that the spaxels used in this analysis are predominantly
star-forming. Figure 2 shows spatially-resolved emission line
diagnostic diagrams, [O iii]/H𝛽 versus [N ii]/H𝛼 (left-hand panel)
and [O iii]/H𝛽 versus [S ii]/H𝛼 (right-hand panel). The blue data
points correspond to all spaxels considered within the galaxy
sample, where the involved emission lines (i.e. H𝛽, [O iii] 𝜆5007,
[N ii] 𝜆6584, H𝛼 and [S ii] 𝜆𝜆6717, 6731) have a S/N >
3. Superimposed green data points are a subset of blue ones
corresponding to those spaxels where the [S iii] 𝜆9532 emission
line is also detected with S/N > 3. On both panels, black solid
curves denote the theoretical maximum starburst line from Kewley
et al. (2001). On the left-hand panel, we also show a black dashed

Figure 2. Left-hand panel: [O iii]/H𝛽 versus [N ii]/H𝛼. Right-hand panel: [O iii]/H𝛽 versus [S ii]/H𝛼. On both panels, spatially-resolved (spaxel-by-spaxel
basis) emission line diagnostic diagrams for all sample galaxies. Blue data points correspond to spatially-resolved (spaxel-by-spaxel basis) emission line ratios
for all spaxels where all emission lines used in the line ratios on the two axes are detected with S/N > 3, where as green data points represent a subset of blue
data points which show the detection of [S iii] 𝜆9532 emission line with S/N > 3. The typical uncertainties on emission line ratios for all data points (i.e. blue
data set) are shown in the bottom right corner of each panel. Solid black curve and dashed black curve correspond to the maximum starburst line from Kewley
et al. (2001) and Kauﬀmann et al. (2003), respectively, which provide a classiﬁcation based on excitation mechanisms. The dashed straight line on right-hand
panel separates Seyferts from LI(N)ERs derived by Kewley et al. (2006). We ﬁnd that a few green data points lie beyond the Kauﬀmann line and Kewley line
in the left-hand and right-hand panels, respectively. However, the typical uncertainties are large enough for these points to put them in star-forming region of
the BPT diagrams.

curve which corresponds to the demarcation line from Kauﬀmann
et al. (2003) derived empirically using ∼105 SDSS galaxies. The
right-hand panel also shows a dashed straight line separating the
spaxels with line ratios exhibited by Seyferts (Sy) and low ionization
(nuclear) emission regions (LI(N)ERs, Belﬁore et al. 2016). On both
panels, we ﬁnd that the spatially-resolved blue data points not only
lie in the star-forming sequence but also spill into the region beyond
the maximum star-burst lines. On the contrary, green data points
(corresponding to spaxels with [S iii] 𝜆9532 detection) appear to
lie on the star-forming sequence better than blue data points. In the
following, we solely concentrate on these green data points.

In Figure 3, the upper panel presents the relations between
[O iii]/H𝛽 versus [N ii]/H𝛼 (left-hand panel) and [O iii]/H𝛽 versus
[S ii]/H𝛼 (right-hand panel), and the lower panel presents the
relation between [S iii]/H𝛼 versus [N ii]/H𝛼 (left-hand panel) and
[S iii]/H𝛼 versus [S ii]/H𝛼 (right-hand panel). On all panels, data are
colour-coded with respect to log EW(H𝛽) which is an age indicator
for the young stellar populations (Leitherer et al. 1999). We ﬁnd that
EW(H𝛽) varies with [S ii]/H𝛼 and [N ii]/H𝛼, with high EW regions
showing higher excitation and lower [N ii]/H𝛼 and [S ii]/H𝛼, while
there is no such trend with respect to [S iii]/H𝛼 suggesting that
[S iii]/H𝛼 is not correlated with age.

We introduce here novel forms of classical BPT diagrams
replacing [O iii]/H𝛽 with [Siii]/H𝛼, that will serve to classify
star-forming regions from LI(N)ER/Sy-like regions for future
studies which lack blue end of optical spectrum. The black curves
in Figure 3 (lower panel) are the maximum starburst curves derived
empirically from a larger sample of MaNGA galaxies (Amorin et
al, in prep). The region lying below these curves are dominated by
stellar photoionization while the region beyond the curves are mostly
ionized by shocks and non-thermal sources. From Figure 3, we ﬁnd
that a majority of spaxels identiﬁed as SF on classical BPT diagrams
(upper panel) show similar ionization on the novel [S iii]-BPT

diagrams in (lower panel). The equation for the maximum starburst
curve for the novel [S iii]-BPT diagnostic diagrams are mentioned
as below:

3 RESULTS: RELATIONS BETWEEN RADIATION
HARDNESS AND FUNDAMENTAL NEBULAR
PARAMETERS

Understanding the hardness of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld is
important as, along with nebular geometry and gas density, it
determines the ionization structure of an H ii region. As explained in
Section 1, radiation hardness may correlate with various properties
of ionizing stars and ionized nebula such as equivalent eﬀective
temperature, stellar age, electron temperature, density and chemical
abundances within a nebula, while nebular structure can be
characterized by ionization parameter. In an H ii region, the ratio of
the number density of ions of same element in successive ionization

Figure 3. Upper panel: [O iii]/H𝛽 versus [N ii]/H𝛼 (left-hand panel) and [O iii]/H𝛽 versus [S ii]/H𝛼 (right-hand panel). The solid black curve on both panels
correspond to the maximum starburst line given in Kewley et al. (2001), while the dashed curve on the left-hand panel corresponds to the demarcation line
between star-forming and Seyfert galaxies derived by Kauﬀmann et al. (2003). The dashed line on the right-hand panel separates Seyferts from LI(N)ERs as
derived in Kewley et al. (2006). Lower panel: [S iii]/H𝛼 versus [N ii]/H𝛼 (left-hand panel) and [S iii]/H𝛼 versus [S ii]/H𝛼 (right-hand panel). The black solid
curve on the lower panels represent the maximum starburst line derived empirically in Amorin et al. (in prep), and presented as equations 12–15. On all panels,
data points represent the spatially-resolved emission line ratios in all 67 galaxies but only for those spaxels which have [S iii] 𝜆9532 detected with S/N > 3,
and are colour-coded with respect to log EW(H𝛽). The typical uncertainties on x- and y-axes are shown in the bottom-right corner of each panel. Note that
these data points correspond to green data points in classical emission line diagnostic diagrams presented in Figure 2.

state (e.g. S2+/S+, O2+/O+) depends on the hardness of the ionizing
spectrum and the eﬀective ionization parameter. The emission line
ratios such as [O iii]/[O ii] and [S iii]/[S ii] are known to be ionization
parameter diagnostics (see e.g. Kewley & Dopita 2002; Morisset
et al. 2016). Thus, by studying the variation of [O iii]/[O ii] versus
[S iii]/[S ii] (referred to as O3O2-S3S2 plane hereafter), we can in
principle remove the eﬀects of ionization parameter and study the
hardness of radiation ﬁeld to a ﬁrst order approximation (Vilchez
& Pagel 1988). In this section, we analyse the O3O2-S3S2 plane
with respect to several other properties which might be related
to the hardness of radiation ﬁeld. We have performed this study

on spaxel-by-spaxel basis for individual galaxies as well as for
all spaxels combined from all 67 galaxies. We note that, despite
some spaxels lie slightly above the SF empirical demarcation lines
in the [S ii]-BPT diagnostic, the overall results presented in this
section remain unchanged if we limit ourselves to those spaxels
whose line ratios lie below the maximum theoretical starburst line
(Kewley et al. 2001) on [S ii]-BPT. In the following we present
the results from the combined sample for all spaxels, though same
analysis for ﬁve individual galaxies are also presented in Appendix
D where [O iii] 𝜆4363 detections are spatially-extended, enough for
a comparison with other line ratios, in particular log 𝜂(cid:48). We also

note that the spaxels presented in these diagrams are correlated over
a few pixels. However, the presence of trends will not be aﬀected
by the correlated pixels, though the absence of trends should be
interpreted with caution.

3.1 Gas-phase Metallicity

Figure 4 shows the O3O2-S3S2 plane for spatially-resolved data
(on spaxel-by-spaxel basis) of all 67 galaxies in the sample where
data points are colour-coded with respect to the abundance-sensitive
emission line ratios, N2, O3N2, Ar3O3, S3O3, R23 and S23. On each
panel, three diagonal dashed lines correspond to constant values of
log 𝜂(cid:48) = −0.5, 0 and 0.5, where 𝜂(cid:48) is given by equation 2. Note
that log 𝜂(cid:48)=0 corresponds to spaxels with O3O2 = S3S2. A harder
radiation ﬁeld corresponds to lower values of log 𝜂(cid:48), and vice-versa.
In the following, we discuss the variation in O3O2-S3S2 relation
with each metallicity diagnostic mentioned above:

• N2 has been shown to increase with an increase in metallicity
(see e.g. Pettini & Pagel 2004; Maiolino et al. 2008; Pérez-Montero
& Contini 2009; Marino et al. 2013; Curti et al. 2017; Maiolino
& Mannucci 2018) over a wide range of metallicities (7.6 < 12
+ log(O/H) < 8.85) though it suﬀers from saturation of [N ii] at
higher metallicities. In Figure 4 (upper-left-hand panel), N2 shows
a gradient on O3O2-S3S2 plane, where it decreases with a decrease
in log 𝜂(cid:48). However, a constant value of log 𝜂(cid:48) does not correspond to
a constant value of N2, which indicates a secondary dependence on
other unknown parameters. We ﬁnd that at a constant S3S2, a lower
value of N2, i.e. a lower metallicity corresponds to a harder radiation
ﬁeld and vice-versa. However, at a constant O3O2, variation of N2
with hardness of radiation ﬁeld is less obvious. Both S3S2 and O3O2
trace ionization parameter (log U), though S3S2 is shown to be a
better diagnostic of log U than O3O2 (Morisset et al. 2016). Hence,
it appears that log 𝜂(cid:48) increases with an increase in metallicity (if
traced by N2) at constant ionization parameter (if traced by S3S2).
We also ﬁnd that the highest values of O3O2 correspond to the
lowest metallicities at a given value of S3S2. This result agrees
with the ﬁndings of Kehrig et al. (2006) and Stasińska et al. (2015)
for local blue compact dwarf galaxies with very high excitation.
Moreover, the photoionization models of Kewley & Dopita (2002,
Figure 1) also show an increase in metallicity with a decrease in
O3O2 at a given ionization parameter (traced by S3S2). We will
further discuss log 𝜂(cid:48) and ionization parameter in Section 3.3.
• O3N2 is known to decrease with an increase in metallicity (see e.g.
Pettini & Pagel 2004; Maiolino et al. 2008; Marino et al. 2013; Curti
et al. 2017; Maiolino & Mannucci 2018), and is deemed to be more
useful than N2 in the high metallicity regime, where [N ii] saturates
but the strength of [O iii] continues to decrease with metallicity.
In Figure 4 (lower-left-hand panel), O3N2 shows a similar gradient
as seen in the case of N2, indicating that metallicity and log 𝜂(cid:48) are
correlated.
• Ar3O3 follows a monotonically increasing relation with the
electron temperature and hence with the metallicity (Stasińska
2006). It is considered to be a more accurate metallicity diagnostic
than N2 at higher metallicity but needs a reliable reddening
correction (unlike N2). Moreover, it is unaﬀected by the presence of
diﬀuse ionized gas (DIG) because of the use of high excitation lines
and not the low excitation lines which may arise in both H ii regions
and DIG. In Figure 4, we study O3O2-S3S2 plane where data points
are colour-coded with respect to Ar3O3 ratio, where higher Ar3O3
indicates higher metallicity. We ﬁnd a similar gradient as N2 and
O3N2 though we note a weaker trend at lower values of O3O2 and

S3S2, which might be simply because of fewer spaxels with enough
S/N (>3) of [Ar iii] 𝜆7135.
• S3O3 is posed as a good diagnostic of metallicity in both low
and high metallicity regimes, which like Ar3O3, is unaﬀected
by the presence of DIG (Stasińska 2006). Hence we explored
O3O2-S3S2 plane with a third variant as S3O3 line ratio in Figure
4 (lower-middle panel). We ﬁnd a clear gradient in S3O3 across log
𝜂(cid:48) = -0.5–0.5, where S3O3 appears to be approximately constant
at a given value of log 𝜂(cid:48) unlike our observation in previous plots.
Note here that it might be simply because emission lines ([S iii]
and [O iii]) involved in this metallicity diagnostic appear in the
numerators of two axes on this plane, while the eﬀect of the two
emission lines in the denominator (i.e. [S ii] and [O ii]) nullify
because of their very similar ionization potentials, and probably
because oxygen and sulphur are produced in similar stars. We should
therefore be cautious while using S3O3 as a metallicity indicator on
the O3O2-S3S2 plane because the involved emission lines appear to
be more sensitive to hardness of radiation ﬁelds.
• R23 traces metallicity but there are two major caveats in its use:
ﬁrstly, it is bimodal with metallicity, secondly it also depends on
ionization parameter (see e.g., Kewley & Dopita 2002). This means
that one needs to determine the metallicity regime (low or high)
as well as ionization parameter to use R23 for inferring a reliable
value of metallicity. In Figure 4 (upper-right-hand panel), we ﬁnd
that the variation of R23 on the O3O2-S3S2 plane is similar to other
metallicity diagnostics though the trend is less obvious for lower
values of O3O2 and S3S2. For example, at a constant value of S3S2
= -0.5, there is practically no trend in R23. It is possible that the
metallicites of these spaxels lie in the "knee", a region of confusion
(i.e. 12 + log(O/H) ∼ 8.1-8.3) where R23 peaks.
• S23 has been used to trace metallicity (Vilchez & Esteban 1996;
Pérez-Montero & Díaz 2005; Kehrig et al. 2006; Hägele et al.
2006), and is similar to the R23 parameter, however the knee (i.e.
metallicity regime of confusion) appears at a higher metallicity
(12 + log(O/H) ∼ 8.8, Kewley & Dopita 2002) than R23. In Figure
4 (lower-right-hand panel), we do not observe a clear gradient
with respect to the S23 emission line ratio. The absence of a clear
gradient at higher metallicities may be because S23 is double-valued
with respect to metallicity and is quite dependent on ionization
parameter (Kewley & Dopita 2002). However, we also ﬁnd that
data points with extremely low-values of S23 clearly show harder
radiation ﬁeld lying between the constant values of log 𝜂(cid:48) = −0.5
to 0. Those data-points (lying in the top-right corner of middle
panel) are predominantly from the central region of a star-forming
galaxy (Manga-8626-12704, see Figure D7) which shows prominent
detection of the auroral line [O iii] 𝜆4363. The detection of this weak
emission line and the range of electron temperatures (Figure D7,
lower-right-hand panel) show that the metallicities of these data
points are low. Hence, in spite of the degeneracies related to the
ionization parameter and double-valued nature of S23, this plot is
consistent with an inverse relation between metallicity and hardness
of radiation ﬁeld.

In summary, we conclude that

the gas-phase metallicity
depends on the radiation hardness as traced by log 𝜂(cid:48) (on O3O2-S3S2
plane), i.e. low-metallicity gas is associated with harder radiation
ﬁeld and vice-versa. This result agrees with those of Kehrig et al.
(2006), who found that H ii regions with lower gaseous metallicity
present harder ionizing spectra. Kewley et al. (2013) pointed out
several potential reasons which might cause the correlation between
metallicity and radiation hardness. However, the diagnostics of
metallicity and ionization parameter are correlated as well (Dopita

might be related to ionization parameter.

Figure 5 shows O3O2-S3S2 plane where data-points are
colour-coded with respect to electron temperature T𝑒([O iii]). We
estimated T𝑒([O iii]) on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis for all galaxies in
the sample where auroral line [O iii] 𝜆4363 was detected with
S/N > 3, by using the emission line ratio of ([O iii] 𝜆𝜆4959,
5007)/[O iii]𝜆4363 with the prescriptions given in Pérez-Montero
(2017). We restrict our analysis of O3O2-S3S2 plane to only those
spaxels with T𝑒([O iii]) lying in the range of 7000-25000 K, as the

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2018)

involved equations are only valid in the above-mentioned range6. We
ﬁnd that the majority of data points lies in the range of log 𝜂(cid:48) = −0.5
and 0. At ﬁrst glance, it might appear that galaxies with [O iii] 4363
detection (and T𝑒([O iii]) estimates) exhibit harder radiation ﬁelds,
though model-based analysis shows no such relation (Figure A1).
The absence of data points with T𝑒 measurements on the lower-left
corner in Figure 5 is likely due to an overall lower O++/O.

Vilchez & Pagel (1988) show that ionic quotient ratio log
𝜂 varies directly with the oxygen abundance. We explore this
further by estimating log 𝜂 using O3O2, S3S2 and T𝑒([O iii])
within equation 3 and study its variation with respect to the

abundance-sensitive emission line ratio O3N2, N2 and Ar3O3 as
shown in Figure 6. We ﬁnd that softness parameter decreases with
O3N2, but increases with N2 and Ar3O3 implying that the hardness
of radiation ﬁeld varies proportionally with the metallicity traced
by the three line ratios. The result agrees with that of Vilchez &
Pagel (1988) who shows an increase of softness parameter with the
oxygen abundance. Since metal leads to cooling, we expect higher
electron temperature for metal-poor gas.The result is in agreement
with that in Section 3.1 where metallicity is found to have an inverse
dependence on log 𝜂(cid:48) at a given log U.

In Figure 6, we also ﬁt the following polynomials between log
𝜂 and abundance-sensitive line ratios O3N2, N2 and Ar3O3 using an
orthogonal distance regression and taking into account uncertainties
on both axes:

log 𝜂 = (−0.096±0.014)O3N2

2−(0.068±0.046)O3N2+(0.540±0.035)

log 𝜂 = (0.483 ± 0.016)N2 + (0.698 ± 0.019)

log 𝜂 = (0.734 ± 0.015)Ar3O3 + (1.47 ± 0.028)

(16)

(17)

(18)

The above equations will allow future studies to estimate log
𝜂 from O3N2, N2 and Ar3O3 which are ratio of strong emission
lines, thus extending the study of radiation hardness even in the
systems where the temperature-sensitive weak auroral lines (e.g.,
[O iii] 𝜆4363) are not detected. We do not claim that the line ratios
O3N2, N2 and Ar3O3 trace radiation hardness, however they can be
used to estimate log 𝜂 because of their sensitivity to metallicity and
probably ionization parameter. So caution should be made while
interpreting the log 𝜂 as radiation hardness when estimated from
O3N2, N2 or Ar3O3. In principle, similar relations can be found
between log 𝜂 and other abundance-sensitive line ratios shown in
Figure 4. However, we do not attempt to ﬁt such a relation of 𝜂
with the line ratios R23 or S23 since both of them are bi-modal in
metallicity. We do not use S3O3 as we establish in Section 3.1 that
the variation of 𝜂(cid:48) with S3O3 might be a systematic eﬀect of using

the emission lines ratios of similar ionization potentials [O ii] and
[S ii] in the deﬁnition of log 𝜂(cid:48).

In Figure 6, data are colour-coded with respect to line ratio
[S ii]𝜆6717/[S ii]𝜆6731 which is sensitive to N𝑒, showing that there
is no obvious relation between N𝑒 and radiation hardness. The result
is consistent with the theoretical deﬁnition of log 𝜂 (Equation 3)
which do not show any ﬁrst-order dependence on N𝑒. Furthermore,
a majority of data exhibit the [S ii] doublet line ratio corresponding
to the N𝑒 typical of H ii regions, i.e. there is not much variation
of N𝑒 within our data set and hence no secondary eﬀect is seen in
log 𝜂. Our results are in agreement with Hunt et al. (2010), who
ﬁnd that N𝑒 is not correlated with radiation hardness, which they
measure by [O iv]/[S ii] line ratio in their sample of dwarf galaxies.
Here, we do a qualitative analysis to infer whether Te might
be related to Teﬀ, on the basis of previous studies which suggest
that log 𝜂(cid:48) decreases with the increase in Teﬀ (e.g. Kennicutt et al.
2000; Pérez-Montero & Vílchez 2009; Pérez-Montero et al. 2019).
7 decreases with respect
Kennicutt et al. (2000) also ﬁnd that Teﬀ
to the gas-phase metallicity in a given abundance range. Similarly,
Hägele et al. (2006) argues that for a given stellar mass, stars of lower
metallicity have higher eﬀective temperature. Our work shows a low
gas-phase metallicity or high Te for low log 𝜂(cid:48). Hence, this might
imply that the star-forming regions hosting hotter stars with harder
ionizing radiation and lower stellar metallicity might have lower
gas-phase metallicity which results in higher electron temperatures.

3.3 Ionization parameter & Equivalent Eﬀective

Temperature

Figure 7 shows the relation between log 𝜂(cid:48) and the emission line
ratios sensitive to ionization parameter, S3S2 (upper panel) and
O3O2 (lower panel), where data points are colour-coded with respect
to EW(H𝛽) and the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient are mentioned
in the bottom-left. We ﬁnd no correlation between log 𝜂(cid:48) and S3S2
(upper panel, 𝜌 = -0.06) while log 𝜂(cid:48) decreases with an increase
in O3O2 (lower panel, 𝜌 = -0.75). S3S2 and O3O2 depend on log
U and Teﬀ diﬀerently. While S3S2 depends more on log U, O3O2
depends more on Teﬀ (Pérez-Montero et al. 2019). Similarly, S3S2
has been shown to be a better diagnostic of ionization parameter
than O3O2 via cloudy photoionization models (Morisset et al.
2016). As such, no correlation of S3S2 and log 𝜂(cid:48) might indicate
that ionization parameter does not depend on radiation hardness as
probed by log 𝜂(cid:48). A similar behaviour is seen in Figure 8 where we
compute log 𝜂 using equation 3 and study its variation with respect
to S3S2 (upper panel) and O3O2 (lower panel). However, we ﬁnd
in Section 3.1 that 𝜂 and 𝜂(cid:48) are correlated with strong line ratios
such that N2 and O3N2 which are not only sensitive to abundance
but also to the ionization parameter. Hence, ionization parameter
might be related to radiation hardness as well, as indicated by other
works (see e.g. Pérez-Montero et al. 2020). We discuss this further
in Section 4.1.

We explore this further in Figure 9 which shows the relation
to
between log 𝜂(cid:48) and log U and color-coded with respect
the equivalent eﬀective temperature Teﬀ. Both log U and Teﬀ
are computed from the python-based code HCm-Teff (v3.1)8
(Pérez-Montero et al. 2019) using the direct-method metallicity
and the emission line ﬂuxes of [O ii] 𝜆3727, [O iii]𝜆5007,

is not within the calibrated range.

[S ii]𝜆6717, 6731 and [S iii] 𝜆9069. We ﬁnd a lower value of log
U for a higher value of log 𝜂(cid:48) and vice-versa, though error bars are
large. Hence, an interdependence between log U and log 𝜂(cid:48) might
be present. We discuss and explore this interdependence more via
a comparison of data with models in Section 4.1.

However, we also note that U, by deﬁnition, is not related to
the shape of radiation ﬁeld but the production rate of the Lyman
continuum photons, distance from the stars or stellar clusters and
ionized or neutral hydrogen density. So, it is also possible that the
emission line ratios S3S2 is rather tracing the ionization state of the
gas which is determined by factors including radiation hardness, U
and optical depth (Ramambason et al. 2020).

In Figure 9, we do not ﬁnd any relation between log 𝜂(cid:48) and
equivalent eﬀective temperature in contrast to the previous studies
which suggest that log 𝜂(cid:48) decreases with an increase in Teﬀ for
galactic and extragalactic H ii regions (Kennicutt et al. 2000) and for
the disk-averaged radial proﬁles of external galaxies (Pérez-Montero
& Vílchez 2009). However, we can not rule out such a dependence
because the typical uncertainties on Teﬀ estimated from HCm-Teff
in our work is almost as large as the range of Teﬀ.

We also studied the relation of log 𝜂 with respect to equivalent
eﬀective temperature and ionization parameter, where the last two
quantities were computed using HCm-Teﬀ code as explained earlier.
The trends are similar to that shown in Figure 9. Note that the large
errors on Teﬀ and lack of clear relation of log 𝜂 or log 𝜂(cid:48) with log
U is likely due to the model grids used in Hcm-Teff (v3.1) based
on single WM-Basic stars. We show later in Section 4.1 that model
grids corresponding to older age stellar populations satisfy MaNGA
dataset which can be used with HCm-Teff to study the relations of
radiation hardness with log U and Teﬀ.

3.4 Age of Stellar Populations

Figure 10 shows O3O2-S3S2 plane where data-points are
colour-coded with respect to equivalent width of H𝛽 (EW(H𝛽))
(upper panel) and the narrow index of 4000 Å-break (DN(4000))
(lower panel), parameters sensitive to age of stellar populations.

EW(H𝛽) measures the ratio of young ionizing population

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2018)

traced by H𝛽 emission line ﬂux to the older non-ionizing population
traced by the underlying continuum. As young and hot massive
stars die, the supply of ionizing photons decreases which depletes
the nebular content of any hydrogen recombination lines (including
H𝛽), while the level of continuum is determined by long-lived,
cooler lower-mass stars. Hence, EW(H𝛽) decreases as the age of
stellar population producing ionizing photons increases. As such,
EW(H𝛽) is a good diagnostic for starburst age and is used in various
IFS studies but its use depends on assumption on various other
parameters such as metallicity, initial mass function, stellar mass
loss rates and star formation history (Leitherer et al. 1999; Levesque
& Leitherer 2013). For instantaneous star-formation, EW(H𝛽) is
sensitive to stellar populations of ages up to 10 Myr (straburst99).
In Figure 10 (upper panel), we ﬁnd that EW(H𝛽) spans a range
of ∼ 1–100 Å indicating that our sample include star-forming
regions with a variety of young stellar populations, from relatively
evolved to very recent starburst. However, our data do not show a
clear correlation between EW(H𝛽) and 𝜂(cid:48) which might be partly
due to the H𝛽 absorption. At high O3O2 and S3S2 we ﬁnd the
highest EW(H𝛽), which corresponds to very young (∼3–5 Myr)
stellar population. Most of these data points show 𝜂(cid:48) lower than
zero, suggesting a harder radiation ﬁeld compared to the average 𝜂(cid:48)
of lower EW points, and hence indicates that the lower age stellar
population are characterized by harder radiation ﬁeld. The result
is consistent with that of Kewley et al. (2001) which ﬁnd that the
ionizing spectrum becomes harder for lower age stellar population
synthesis models of Pegase v2.0 (Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997)
and starburst99 (Leitherer et al. 1999). In Figures 7 and 10, we ﬁnd
high O3O2 and high S3S2 for high EW(H𝛽) overall, consistent with
Campbell et al. (1986), which ﬁnd strong correlation between the
O3O2 and EW(H𝛽) in H ii galaxies indicating that high ionization
parameter might be related to younger stellar populations.

DN(4000) represents the ratio of the narrow continuum bands
(3850–3950Å and 4000–4100Å, Balogh et al. 1999) around the
break occurring at 4000 Å which is caused by a strongly changing
opacity of stellar atmospheres at this wavelength. In hot O and
B stars, metal ions exist in highly ionized state which eﬀectively
decreases the opacity leading to weaker 4000 Å-break than stars of

other spectral types. As a result, old metal-rich galaxies have larger
4000 Å-break than galaxies hosting younger stellar population. In
Figure 10 (lower panel), we ﬁnd that a majority of data points
have DN(4000) lying in the range 0.8–1.3 (i.e. at 99% conﬁdence
interval) indicating relatively young stellar populations, i.e. (cid:46) 500
Myr (see e.g. Noll et al. 2009; Winter et al. 2010). We note here that
unlike EW(H𝛽), DN(4000) is independent of metallicity up to an
age of 1 Gyr. Furthermore, unlike EW(H𝛽), DN(4000) is sensitive to
underlying older stellar population which might be co-spatial with
the younger population traced by EW(H𝛽). Despite such diﬀerences,
both D𝑁 (4000) and EW(H𝛽) shows a broadly consistent variation
on the O3O2-S3S2 plane, i.e. younger regions (with higher EW(H𝛽)
and low D𝑁 (4000)) seem to have higher ionization parameter (i.e.
higher O3O2 and higher S3S2) at a given value of 𝜂(cid:48).

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Comparison with photoionization models

In this section we compare our observational results with predictions
from photoionization models. The goal of this exercise is to provide
a qualitative interpretation of the observed sulphur line ratios and
discuss possible model limitations identiﬁed by previous works.
In particular, some standard photoionization models appear to
struggle in reproducing simultaneously high and low ionization
lines observed in star-forming galaxies using both long-slit and IFU
data. For example, Pérez-Montero & Vílchez (2009) and Kehrig
et al. (2006) speciﬁcally showed that such models fail to explain
the hardness of ionizing radiation of most low-mass star-forming
galaxies in the O3O2-S3S2 plane. More recently, the shortcomings
of photoionization models to reproduce sulphur ratios of a more
general population of star-forming galaxies using MaNGA data
have been addressed by Mingozzi et al. (2020), who suggest that
this is due to limitations in the stellar atmosphere modelling and/or

ﬁxed electron density of 100 cm−3.

99.7% of the MaNGA spatially-resolved data shown in Figure 4.
Additionally, we include non-LTE model predictions from Díaz
et al. (2000), whose derivation is shown in Appendix A. We prefer
here to show the full set of individual model predictions for each
line ratio instead of the usual grid visualization in order to highlight
diﬀerences and similarities with data and provide a qualitative
interpretations of our results. Finally, we note that shock models,
which may aﬀect the line ratios in complicated ways, have not been
considered.

Conversely to previous works, the combination of model
predictions from BOND and CALIFA do cover most data points

problems with sulphur line strengths due to inaccurate atomic data
(see also Garnett 1989; Kewley et al. 2019, and references therein).
While the sample used for the comparison performed by Mingozzi
et al. (2020) is larger than that used in this work, the explored
range of line ratios is actually very similar. For their comparison
they used four diﬀerent models which include those of (Dopita
et al. 2013; Levesque et al. 2010; Byler et al. 2017; Pérez-Montero
2014). The best agreement with data was found to be the grid of
Cloudy photoionization models by Pérez-Montero (2014), though
these models did not cover a signiﬁcant fraction of the data analysed
by Mingozzi et al. (2020) and in particular the S3S2 ratio.

In order to explore these issues further, we have used the most
recent CLOUDY v17.02 photoionization models available through
the Mexican Million Models database (3MdB, Morisset et al. 2015).
One of the improvements of Cloudy v17.02 compared to previous
versions is the inclusion of updated atomic parameters for sulphur,
which is relevant to our study. Here, we use two sets of model
grids, namely BOND-2 and CALIFA-2 in the 3MdB-17 database9
both of which adopt a spectral energy distribution obtained from
the population synthesis code PopStar (Mollá et al. 2009) for a
Chabrier (2003) stellar IMF between 0.5 and 100 M(cid:12). BOND-2
is an extension of the model grids developed for the code BOND
(Bayesian Oxygen and Nitrogen abundance Determinations, Vale
Asari et al. 2016) for the starburst age going up to 6 Myr and is
used to derive oxygen and nitrogen abundances simultaneously in
giant H ii regions. On the other hand, CALIFA-2 is an extension
of the model grids devised for the analysis of CALIFA galaxies
(Cid Fernandes et al. 2013) and additionally uses the starlight
spectral base of simple stellar populations of up to several Gyr (Cid
Fernandes et al. 2014). The combination of BOND and CALIFA

95% and 99.7% of the datapoints shown in Figure 4, respectively. Both

in our sample. We note that this is mostly because of the inclusion
of CALIFA models, as can be seen from the comparison shown
in Figures A1-A4. The use of BOND models alone produce a
systematic mismatch with nearly half of the spaxels, which is
removed when CALIFA models are adopted. Moreover, in Figure 11
the mean relation obtained from Díaz et al. (2000) models match
the data relatively well, but a slight oﬀset in the models towards
higher S3S2 is apparent.

One of the main diﬀerences between the BOND and CALIFA
models is the age of the ionizing stellar populations. In the former,
this is restricted to OB stars in their ﬁrst 6 Myr, while the latter
includes aged stellar populations of up to several Gyr which
contribute to lower-ionization regions (see e.g. Morisset et al. 2016).
While such older age stellar population are generally found in the
early type galaxies with only a few or negligible H ii regions, it is also
possible that there is an underlying older stellar population along
with the young stellar population within the galaxies under study.
For example, a few galaxies in our sample are blue compact dwarfs
which are known to host both young and old stellar populations (see
e.g., Aloisi et al. 2005; Amorín et al. 2009). Another possibility is the
presence of hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES, Flores-Fajardo
et al. 2011) with hard radiation ﬁelds as shown in Figure A4 where
lower EW(H𝛽) and lower log(Q0/Q1) indicative of older stellar
population tend to have relatively lower log 𝜂(cid:48) indicative of harder
radiation ﬁeld. HOLMES might be associated with the low surface
brightness regions, mostly have low log U and low log 𝜂(cid:48) values,
i.e. low O3O2 and low S3S2. As Figure 11 shows, lower log U
models match better with lower S3S2, whereas low O3O2 does not
necessarily indicate low ionization parameter, probably pointing to
secondary dependencies (e.g. metallicity; Kewley et al. 2019).

A good agreement between observations and models is also
seen in Figure 12, where we show the variation of log 𝜂(cid:48) as a
function of S3S2 (left-hand panel) and O3O2 (right-hand panel)
and color-coded with respect to log U. This ﬁgure shows that the
BOND and CALIFA models predict nearly all possible values of

ionization parameter for a ﬁxed value of log 𝜂(cid:48). This comparison
also help us to understand the observational trends seen in Figure 7.
The MaNGA data with higher EWs can be identiﬁed with models
having both larger log U and harder radiation ﬁeld (𝜂(cid:48)). Comparing
the trends shown by S3S2 and O3O2, the former appears to be again
a better diagnostic of the ionization parameter, less dependent of the
hardness of the ionizing radiation. Moreover, Figure 13 shows that
S3S2 has a negligible relation with the metallicity-sensitive N2 ratio
in the models, in contrast to the O3O2 ratio. Similar trends are seen
in the data. Therefore, S3S2 appears again as a more reliable tracer
of log U than O3O2 as secondary dependencies with metallicity
appear smaller.

The discrepancies found in previous works between data and
models may come from a variety of factors. Models strongly rely on
their simpliﬁed assumptions, such as the adopted geometry of the
nebula (see Figure 11), simpliﬁed temperature and density structure,
or the uncertain atomic data for sulphur (e.g. Kewley et al. 2019). In
the case of the line ratios under consideration, we ﬁnd that models
including the contribution to low-ionization gas by aged stellar
populations, in particular HOLMES with hard radiation ﬁelds can
signiﬁcantly contribute to solve the discrepancies found by previous
works relying on models in which the low and high ionization lines
are powered only by very young stellar clusters (e.g. Mingozzi et al.
2020). Indeed, HOLMES have been proposed to explain line ratios
sensitive to DIG in the past (e.g. Morisset et al. 2016), as these stellar
populations can signiﬁcantly contribute to increase the strength of
some low-ionization lines [Sii] (Sanders et al. 2017). In Figure 11
and Figure 12, we see that data showing low S3S2 and moderate
to low O3O2 (i.e. relatively hard radiation ﬁeld but low ionization
parameter) related to the low-excitation gas can be better described
with CALIFA models than BOND models, which seems to match
better data with higher log U and higher log 𝜂(cid:48) values (Figure A
for a direct comparison).

Although we selected our data points to have [Siii] detections
and the contribution of DIG emission in our sample should not
dominate in high EW data points probing high surface brightness
regions (see examples of spatially resolved maps in Appendix D),
the contribution of HOLMES is probably not negligible. This is
especially true at low EW(H𝛽) (characteristic of HOLMES), making
the [Sii] emission higher and therefore decreasing the S3S2 ratios
in Figure12 compared to models. Similarly, there is likely an eﬀect
of underlying older stellar population in these young star-forming
galaxies. We principally performed this analysis on spaxels with [S
iii] detection, some of which go beyond the maximum star-burst
line in Figure 2 and hence could be aﬀected by DIG. To rule out any
eﬀects in sample selection, we investigated only those data points
which lie below the maximum starburst line on [S ii]-BPT and found
that there were still line ratios on O3O2-S3S2 plane which could be
explained by the older age CALIFA model grids but not the BOND
model grids.

On the other hand, we do not see any signiﬁcant mismatch
between data and the BOND models in the S3-N2 and S3-S2
diagnostics presented in Figure 3, which are also reproduced by
the CALIFA models (see Appendix A, Figure A1-A2). From these
simple diagnostic, we can conclude that the S3-S2 plane (or the
S3S2 ratio) is an excellent diagnostic for the ionization parameter
which shows a little dependence with metallicity (Figure 13), as also
shown by previous models (e.g. Kewley & Dopita 2002; Kewley
et al. 2019).

Finally, we note that a recent approach to reconcile observed
S3S2 and O3O2 ratios with models is presented by Ramambason
et al. (2020), who show that classic photoionization models, like the

ones we use in Figure 12 and 13, can underpredict the low-excitation
line emission of [Sii] arising from the outskirts of H ii regions.
To alleviate this, Ramambason et al. (2020) propose a composite
model combining high and low ionization parameters which is able
to reconcile the S3S2 ratios of star-forming galaxies in SDSS using
the same BONDS model grids adopted in our study. This is likely a
much more reliable solution to model star-forming regions showing
very high ionization, like the ones analysed by Ramambason et al.
(2020).

star-forming galaxies and lie within the same range of log 𝜂(cid:48) as
our spatially-resolved data, i.e. -0.5 < log 𝜂(cid:48) < 0.5. However, the
majority of these data set have comparatively higher values of O3O2
and S3S2 than our spatially-resolved data set. Since these two line
ratios are sensitive to ionization parameter, it is possible that a
large part of the sample of Dors et al. (2016) consists of objects
with comparatively higher values of ionization parameter. We also
ﬁnd that all galaxies from Hirschauer et al. (2015) except one lie
close to log 𝜂(cid:48) = 0. We note that the galaxy from the sample of
Hirschauer et al. (2015) with a relatively higher value of log 𝜂(cid:48)
have a relatively lower value of [O iii] equivalent width and higher
metallicity compared to the other galaxies in their sample.

In Figure 14, we study the O3O2-S3S2 plane where we compare
spatially-resolved data from this study (brown points) with
published data from literature, including H ii regions along with
global data of emission line galaxies. Table 2 shows data from
literature along with references.

We ﬁnd that H ii regions from the nearby blue compact dwarf
galaxy NGC4449 (Annibali et al. 2017) are close to log 𝜂(cid:48) = 0.

and Teﬀ for these three galaxies using the same data set used here.
For NGC 5194, they ﬁnd that the H ii regions in the central region
(< 4R𝑒) of this galaxy show a drop in metallicity and have log 𝜂(cid:48)
<0.5, while the H ii regions in the outskirts have higher log 𝜂(cid:48) >
0.5 and near-solar metallicity. In Figure 14, H ii regions in NGC
5194 (green points) with log 𝜂(cid:48) < 0.5 and sub-solar metallicity
coincide with our sample. Hence, the oﬀset of H ii regions in
spiral galaxies with respect to the MaNGA spatially-resolved data
on the O3O2-S3S2 plane in Figure 14 indicate that our sample
of predominantly irregular galaxies (and hence relatively lower
gas-phase metallicities) have harder radiation ﬁelds on average
compared to the higher-metallicity H ii regions of CHAOS spiral
galaxies. Pérez-Montero et al. (2019) also mention that there might
be some relation of radiation hardness with log U and Teﬀ for which
they suggest doing more detailed analysis. Furthermore, another
possibility of the mismatch between MaNGA spatially-resolved data
and the overall location of H ii regions can be explained by the age
of stellar populations. In Section 4.1, we ﬁnd that the older stellar
population included as ionization source in CALIFA model grids
are necessary to match the MaNGA spatially-resolved data, while
Pérez-Montero et al. (2019) show that the H ii regions within these
spiral galaxies could be explained by the single star models.

While it is hard to clearly ﬁnd the relation between radiation
hardness and fundamental nebular properties, the analyses here
shown that
the similarities and diﬀerences between MaNGA
spatially-resolved data and other data set shown in Figure 14 are
likely related to gas-phase metallicities with secondary dependence
of other properties such as ionization parameter and age and
equivalent eﬀective temperature of stellar populations and possibly
DIG.

4.3 Radiation Hardness and Helium ionization

The nebular Helium emission is often associated with hard radiation
ﬁelds (see e.g., Kehrig et al. 2015, 2018; Senchyna et al. 2020;

Figure 15. He ii 𝜆4686/H𝛽 versus [N ii]/H𝛼 on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis
for all galaxies in the sample where He ii 𝜆4686 was detected but no WR
bump. These galaxies are marked with † in Table 1. The solid black curve
represents the maximum starburst line taken from Shirazi & Brinchmann
(2012), and was devised to separate the star-forming galaxies from the AGNs
or composite objects.

Pérez-Montero et al. 2020). The He ii 𝜆4686 line can only be
produced by the sources of hard ionizing radiation because the
ionization potential of He ii is very high (i.e. 54.4eV). Such hard
radiation can be produced by AGNs (Shirazi & Brinchmann 2012),
stellar sources, such as cool white dwarf stars (Bergeron et al.
1997; Stasińska et al. 2008; Singh et al. 2013), hot wolf-rayet
(WR) stars (Schaerer 1996), shocks (Thuan & Izotov 2005), massive
X-ray binaries (Garnett et al. 1991), post-AGB stars, (Binette et al.
1994; Papaderos et al. 2013), rapidly rotating, metal-free massive
stars and/or binary population of very metal-poor massive stars
(Kehrig et al. 2018). Given the importance of Helium detection
in the context of hardness, we analyse seven galaxies separately
here where He II 4686 was detected. These galaxies are marked
with a † in Table 1, and relevant maps of this sample are shown in
Section C. We have excluded two galaxies MaNGA-8250-3703 and
MaNGA-8458-3702, in spite of He ii 𝜆4686 detection. The former

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2018)

is excluded because the He ii emission in this galaxy shows the
Wolf-Rayet bump which is too broad to be considered as purely
nebular. The latter is excluded because He ii and H𝛽 are not
co-spatial and as such prevents the analysis presented below.

Figure 15 shows variation of He ii 𝜆4686/H𝛽 with [N ii]/H𝛼
on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis in seven galaxies where He ii 𝜆4686
are detected. The solid black line corresponds to the maximum
line taken from Shirazi & Brinchmann (2012) and
starburst
estimated from the Charlot & Longhetti (2001) models based on
population synthesis codes of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) and cloudy
photoionization models (Ferland 1996). On the original diagram of
Shirazi & Brinchmann (2012), the region lying below the maximum
starburst line correspond to star-forming galaxies while the region
beyond this line correspond to He ii/H𝛽 values which would require
the contribution of some non-thermal ionization mechanism, such as
an AGN. In Figure 15, we have colour-coded data points with respect
to the age diagnostic, EW(H𝛽) which shows a smooth gradient
going from star-forming part of the diagram to the AGN/composite
part. The data points lying beyond the demarcation line belong to
three diﬀerent galaxies (manga-8549-6104, manga-8553-3704 and
manga-8613-12703), and these spaxels are located on the edges of
the brightest region in the H𝛼 map, and have a relatively lower
EW(H𝛽). Since these spaxels do not coincide with the bright SF
regions with high excitation but lie at their edges, it is possible that
the enhanced He ii/H𝛽 is due to the shocks (Thuan & Izotov 2005;
Shirazi & Brinchmann 2012). However, an imperfect continuum
subtraction might also be a problem as these spaxels with high He
ii/H𝛽 also have low EW(He ii) (< 2Å).

In Figure 16, we study the relation between log 𝜂(cid:48) and He ii
𝜆4686/H𝛽10 on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis for those galaxies where
He ii 𝜆4686 is detected without any contamination by a WR broad
stellar emission (see Table 1). log 𝜂(cid:48) increases with He ii 𝜆4686/H𝛽
up to log He ii 𝜆4686/H𝛽 ∼ -1.5, after which log 𝜂(cid:48) becomes
constant, suggesting that lower values of He ii 𝜆4686/H𝛽 correspond
to harder radiation ﬁelds, contrary to the expectation that harder
radiation ﬁeld would result in nebular Helium lines. Further tests
need to be done on a larger sample of galaxies where nebular helium
lines are detected. The data marked as stars have [O iii] 𝜆4363
detections and electron temperatures from the [O iii] 43636/[O iii]
5007 line ratio lie between 7000–25000K. The data points in this
Figure are colour-coded with respect to abundance-sensitive line
ratio O3N2, thus showing a smooth increase in metallicity with
increasing He ii 𝜆4686/H𝛽 and decreasing log 𝜂(cid:48). Though there
is a strong dependence of O3N2 on the ionization parameter, we
deem our choice of O3N2 to be the most appropriate here because
the metallicity diagnostics such as R23 and O3S2 (Kumari et al.
2019; Maiolino & Mannucci 2019), which have only a secondary
dependence on log U, are also bimodal.

In this study, we could not map all optical Helium lines (He I
5876, He I 6678, He I 7785), and He II 4686 was detected only in a
few spaxels. Deeper S/N data would help us overcome challenges of
this work, for which ground-based GMOS-IFU would be extremely
useful. A possible avenue to investigate this work further is to study
the UV Helium lines in low-metallicity local galaxies, for which
COS and STIS instruments on HST would be extremely useful.
With the launch of JWST, we will be able to apply the ﬁndings from
the ground-based optical studies and space-based UV studies, to the

5 SUMMARY

In this paper, we used the IFS MaNGA data of 67 nearby (0.02
(cid:46) z (cid:46) 0.06) star-forming galaxies to explore the relation between
radiation hardness and various properties encoded in the emission
lines emanating from the ionized gas within star-forming galaxies.
In particular, we studied in detail softness parameter (log 𝜂, Vilchez
& Pagel 1988) by investigating the observable quantity log 𝜂(cid:48)
which is the ratio of the two emission line ratios, O3O2 and S3S2
accessible by the long wavelength range of MaNGA covering the
NIR sulphur lines such as [S iii] 𝜆𝜆 9069, 9532. In this analysis,
we have considered various diagnostics sensitive to age, electron
temperature, metallicity and ionization parameter in addition to
exploring available models for explaining the observations. The
main ﬁndings of this work are summarized below:

(i) We ﬁnd that

log 𝜂(cid:48) is correlated to strong line metallicity
diagnostics such as O3N2, N2, Ar3O3, S3O3, R23 and S23. So,
softness parameter, and consequently hardness of radiation ﬁelds
can be directly related to metallicity of ionized gas. We provide
polynomial relations between log 𝜂 and abundance-sensitive strong
line ratios such as O3N2, N2 and Ar3O3 which will allow us to
study radiation hardness in galaxies where temperature-sensitive
faint auroral lines are not detected thus preventing to estimate
softness parameter from its deﬁnition. We caution here not to
use these relations for high-metallicity spiral galaxies which are
systematically oﬀset with respect to the low-metallicity galaxies
(7.12<12+log(O/H)<8.6) from which these relations are derived.
(ii) We do not ﬁnd any particular trend on the S3S2-O3O2 plot
with respect to age diagnostics (EW(H𝛽) and D𝑁 (4000)), though
there are signatures of harder radiation ﬁeld for lower EW(H𝛽).
Similarly, we do not ﬁnd direct evidence of a relation between
radiation hardness and ionization parameter and equivalent eﬀective

18

temperature, but such possibilities can not be completely ruled out.
No correlation is found between radiation hardness and electron
density.

(iii) We compare the spatially-resolved data with predictions from two
publicly available Cloudy (v.17) photoionization models, which
allow us to study the relation between the stellar age and radiation
hardness. Photoionization models including both young and evolved
stellar populations are able to predict the observed line ratios
indicating that the hot and old low-mass stars such as HOLMES
and underlying older stellar population in the star-forming galaxies
might also be associated with hard radiation ﬁelds.

(iv) We compared the MaNGA data with published O3O2 and S3S2
emission line ratios for star-forming galaxies and H ii regions within
star-forming galaxies, and compared them with MaNGA data set
from this work. We ﬁnd that higher metallicity H ii regions within
CHAOS spiral galaxies have on average higher softness parameter
than the relatively lower-metallicity MaNGA star-forming galaxies
studied here.

(v) Helium is generally associated with the harder radiation ﬁelds,
hence we explored the relation between log 𝜂(cid:48) and He ii/H𝛽 in seven
galaxies of our sample where He ii𝜆4686 is detected. We ﬁnd that
regions with softer ionizing radiation (i.e. higher 𝜂(cid:48)) with Helium
detection tend to have higher He ii/H𝛽 ratios, higher metallicity and
lower EW(H𝛽), and might be related to shocks.

Finally, the results of this study are useful in investigating
the radiation hardness in high-z low-metallicity galaxies targeted
by future ground and space-based telescopes such as James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST) and European Extremely Large Telescope.
This work is crucial in preparation for the upcoming high-z surveys
exploiting the outstanding NIR facilities such as Near Infrared
Spectrograph (NIRSPec) on JWST and Multi Object Optical and
Near-infrared Spectrograph (MOONS) on Very Large Telescope
(VLT). These future surveys will provide access to [S iii] lines for
galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts, hence it is important
to probe the usefulness of line ratios involving sulphur lines in
local galaxies as potentially useful tracers of hardness, ionization,
and metallicity. Moreover, the detailed spatially-resolved analysis
of radiation hardness will further aid in understanding the extreme
conditions in high redshift galaxies which host harder ionizing
radiation (Stark et al. 2015).

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

This paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX ﬁle prepared by the author.

Supplementary data are available at MNRAS online.

Figures C1-C7
Figures D1-D8

APPENDIX A: PHOTOIONIZATION MODELS

Figures A1–A4 show additional comparisons of photoionization
models (BOND and CALIFA) and spatially-resolved data in
diﬀerent parameter space, including O3O2 versus S3S2 (Figure 4),
and the novel emission line diagnostic diagrams (Figure 3). These
models are ﬁrst presented in Figure 11. In that ﬁgure, we also
show model prediction (straight-line) from Díaz et al. (2000) and is
described below.

Díaz et al.

(2000) used a large grid of

single-star
cloudy photoionization models (Ferland 1996), with non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) single star stellar atmosphere
models, closed geometry and constant particle density and derived
the relation between log U and the emission line ratios sensitive to
ionization parameter such as O3O2 and S3S2 (see equations 7 and
8 in Díaz et al. 2000). We combine the two equations to derive the
following relation represented by the solid black line in Figure 11,

O3O2 = 2.1 S3S2 + 0.0375

(A1)
We note that Díaz et al. (2000) discarded their relation of
log U-O3O2 as this formula underestimated the values of log U
compared to other formulae for log U derived in their work.

APPENDIX B: SDSS CUTOUTS OF ALL 67 GALAXIES IN
THE SAMPLE

Figures B1-B3 show the SDSS cutouts of all 67 galaxies in our
sample where the magenta hexagon indicates the FOV of MaNGA
and the horizontal green line indicates an angular scale of 5 arcsec.
The four directions, north (N), south (S), east (E) and west (W) are
shown as the vertical and horizontal green lines in the centre of each
image. The MaNGA id is mentioned at the upper-right corner of
each cutout.

APPENDIX C: GALAXIES WITH HELIUM DETECTION

Figures C1-C7 present the relavant maps of those galaxies in our
sample where helium is detected. These maps include those of H𝛼
line ﬂux, He ii 𝜆4686/H𝛽, [O iii]𝜆5007/H𝛽, equivalent width of H𝛽
and softness parameter (all quantities in logarithmic).

APPENDIX D: GALAXIES WITH [O III] 𝜆4363
DETECTION

Figures D1–D8 show the spatially-resolved maps of several
properties of galaxies with extended [O iii] 𝜆4363 detection. We
have speciﬁcally chosen to show these data set because [O iii]
𝜆4363 detection allow us to determine T𝑒 and hence log 𝜂 which is
the proxy for radiation hardness. In addition, these ﬁgures also show
the O3O2–S3S2 plane for each galaxies colour-coded with respect
to parameters sensitive to abundance, T𝑒, and stellar age.

Figure A1. Photoionization models (colour points) and spatially-resolved data (black contours) represented on the O3O2-S3S2 plane, where we have overlaid
the three dashed lines corresponding to constant values of log 𝜂(cid:48) = -0.5, 0, 0.5. Inner to outer contours represent the 68%, 95% and 99.7% of the datapoints
shown in Figure 4, respectively. CALIFA models (Left-hand panel) and BOND models (Right-hand panel) are colour-coded with respect to the electron
temperature (see Section 3.2).

Figure A2. Photoionization models (colour points) and spatially-resolved data (gray contours) represented on the O3O2-S3S2 plane, where we have overlaid
the three dashed lines corresponding to constant values of log 𝜂(cid:48) = -0.5, 0, 0.5. Inner to outer contours represent the 68%, 95% and 99.7% of the datapoints
shown in Figure 4, respectively. CALIFA models (Left-hand panel) and BOND models (Right-hand panel) are colour-coded by the ionization parameter (see
Section 4).

S3-S2 plane (Right-hand panel), respectively. Inner to outer contours represent the 68%, 95% and 99.7% of the data points shown in Figure 3 (lower-panel),
respectively. BOND models are colour-coded by the gas-phase metallicity (Left-hand panel) and ionization parameter (Right-hand panel). See Section 4 for
details on the models.

Figure A4. CALIFA photoionization models represented on the O3O2-S3S2 plane and colour-coded with respect to the age sensitive parameters, log(EW(H𝛽))
(left-hand panel) and log(Q0/Q1) (right-hand panel). We have overlaid spatially-resolved data (gray contours) and the three dashed lines corresponding to
constant values of log 𝜂(cid:48) = -0.5, 0, 0.5. Inner to outer contours represent the 68%, 95% and 99.7% of the data points shown in Figure 4, respectively.
