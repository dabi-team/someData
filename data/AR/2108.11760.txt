Abstract—In this letter, an energetic and highly eﬃcient
dispersive wave (DW) generation at 200 nm has been numerically
demonstrated by selectively exciting LP02-like mode in a 10
bar Ar-ﬁlled hollow-core anti-resonant ﬁber pumping in the
anomalous dispersion regime at 1030 nm with pulses of 30
fs duration and 7 𝜇J energy. Our calculations indicate high
conversion eﬃciency of >35% (2.5 𝜇J) after propagating 3.6 cm
ﬁber length which is due to the strong shock eﬀect and plasma
induced blue-shifted soliton. It is observed that the eﬃciency of
fundamental LP01-mode is about 15% which is much smaller than
LP02-like mode and also emitted at longer wavelength of 270 nm.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE ultraviolet (UV) spectral range (100-400 nm) is of

great interest in the scientiﬁc community because of wide
range of applications such as spectroscopy [1], control of
chemical reactions [2], biomedicine [3], and femtosecond (fs)
pump–probe measurements [4]. Despite of numerous appli-
cations, the availability of such UV sources in this spectral
regime are limited and a very few laser sources directly
emit UV light and some require complex set-up [5]. These
UV laser sources include excimer lasers [6], cerium ﬂuoride
lasers [7], harmonic generation [8], and diode lasers [9].
Recently, hollow-core anti-resonant ﬁbers (HC-ARFs) oﬀer
many appealing features including broadband guidance, low-
light glass overlap, low propagation loss, and weak anomalous
dispersion to study ultrafast nonlinear dynamics when ﬁlled
with noble gases [10]–[15]. One of the remarkable features of
adding gas in HC-ARF is that both the dispersion landscape
and nonlinearity can be tuned by simply changing the pressure
of the gas. Based on these properties, several impressive results
have been reported to generate light in the UV [5], [11]–[13].
However most of the works on the UV light generation have
been performed considering the excitation of a pure LP01-like
mode and it is relied on a well-known process called soliton
self-compression to the sub single-cycle regime, followed by
resonant DW radiation [10]. For example, bright emission of

UV light was ﬁrst theoretically predicted in an Ar-ﬁlled HC-
ARF with eﬃciency of 20% [16] and later experimentally
reported with eﬃciency of 6% [11]. Recently, an energetic
DW generation at 275 nm is experimentally demonstrated by
pumping in the mid-IR regime of 2460 nm [12].

In this work, blue-shifted DW generation with high con-
version eﬃciency at around 200 nm has been demonstrated
by exciting LP02-like mode in an uniform Ar-ﬁlled HC-ARF
with experimentally feasible ﬁber and pulse parameters. The
generated DW has an eﬃciency of >35% when the ﬁber is
ﬁlled under 10 bar Ar, pumped in the anomalous dispersion
regime of 1030 nm, 30 fs pulse duration, and 7 𝜇J pulse
energy. The high eﬃciency of the generated DW wave is due
to the combination of self-phase modulation and anomalous
dispersion, extreme shock eﬀect and plasma-induced blue-
shifted soliton. The temporal pulse is compressed down to less
than single cycle of ∼1.5 fs. In comparison, the the nonlinear
dynamics of LP01-like mode is also investigated. When a LP01-
like mode is excited, the DW emits at a longer wavelength of
∼270 nm with eﬃciency of 15%. However, the compressed
pulse is not suﬃcient to ionize the gas due to the lack of
suﬃcient free electron generation.

II. FIBER MODELING AND MODAL DISPERSION

√

(𝑛2

The HC-ARF considered in this work consists of 10-nested
tubes with a core diameter of 40 𝜇m, wall thickness of 300 nm,
gap separation of 2 𝜇m, and nested tube tube ratio, 𝑑∕𝐷 = 0.5.
The wall thickness of 300 nm provides the center of ﬁrst-order
resonance at 630 nm calculated using [17]: 𝜆𝑟 = 2𝑡
g − 1),
𝑚
where 𝑡 is the wall thickness, 𝑛g is the refractive index of
silica glass, and 𝑚 is the resonance order. The wall thickness
is chosen 300 nm such that the resonance is far away from
the laser pump wavelength of 1030 nm. The modal properties
of the ﬁber was calculated using ﬁnite-element (FE) modeling
Ⓡ software according to [17]–[19]. The HC-
based on COMSOL
ARF can be designed multi-mode by carefully engineering the
cladding parameters and number of tubes [18]. The ﬁber is
shown in Fig. 1(a) which can support more than 20 spatial
modes and has maximum threshold loss of <100 dB/km.
Fig. 1(a) shows the mode-ﬁeld proﬁles of LP01 and LP02-like
modes which are well conﬁned in the core and the loss of
these modes are <10 dB/km at the pump wavelength of 1030
nm.

The propagation constant of LP𝑚𝑛-like mode of HC-ARF

can be represented using a capillary model [21]:

calculated according to [10] neglecting the ionization eﬀect.
It can be seen from Fig. 1(b) that the DW of a pure LP02-like
mode is blue shifted compared to the LP01-like mode since
the zero-dispersion wavelength of LP02-like mode resides in
the blue side.

III. PULSE PROPAGATION EQUATION

The optical pulse propagation was studied using a unidirec-
tional pulse propagation equation which includes free-electron
eﬀects but without considering polarization and coupling
between the diﬀerent modes can be expressed as [23]–[25]:

according to [20]. The group velocity dispersion (GVD) of
a 40 𝜇m HC-ARF under 10 bar Ar was calculated using the
capillary model which has been extensively used to study the
ultrafast nonlinear dynamics in gas-ﬁlled ﬁber systems [23]–
[26]. In comparison, the GVD was also calculated using FE
modeling and it is seen from Fig. 1(a) that both models agrees
very well. The only diﬀerence between the two models is
that FE modeling can track the resonance bands which are
determined by the ﬁber wall thickness. The zero-dispersion
wavelength of LP01 and LP02-like modes are 712 nm and
481 nm respectively. At the pump wavelength, the calculated
GVD of LP01 and LP02-like modes are –4.95 fs2/cm and –
32.91 fs2/cm respectively. The phase mismatch (Δ𝛽) between
the soliton and dispersive wave (DW) of LP01 and LP02-
like modes are shown in Fig. 1(b). The phase mismatch was

neglected due to the very low light–glass overlap (<<1%) and
we assume nonradial dependence of plasma. A quasi-static
tunneling based on Ammosov, Delone, and Krainov (ADK)
model was used to calculate the plasma density [27].

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The spectral and temporal evolution of LP01 and LP02-like
mode in a 10 cm long ﬁber ﬁlled with 10 bar Ar, pumped at
1030 nm with 30 fs pulse and pulse energy of 7 𝜇J is shown
in Fig. 2. We begin our analyses by considering the excitation
of LP01-like mode. For fundamental LP01-like mode, the pulse
undergoes soliton self-compression down to ∼3.5 fs with peak
intensity >65 TW/cm2 after propagating ∼5.5 cm due to
the interplay between self-phase modulation and anomalous
dispersion. At
the maximum compression point, a DW is
emitted at ∼270 nm in the normal dispersion regime and
a supercontinuum generation (SC) spanning 270–1800 nm.
However, the peak intensity of the compressed pulse was
not enough to ionize the gas since the plasma density at the
maximum temporal compression point was found around 1014
cm−3 (see Fig. 4(b)). Therefore, a similar spectral and temporal
evolution can be seen when the ionization eﬀect is turned-oﬀ
which is not shown in Fig. 2.

For LP02-like mode, the pulse undergoes a strong soliton
self-compression down to ∼1.5 fs (less than a single cycle)
with peak intensity >220 TW/cm2 at an early stage of ∼3.6
cm, and a strong DW is emitted at 200 nm. Such a high intense
pulse is enough to ionize the gas and form a plasma and
a blue-shifted soliton (BSF) appears in the spectral proﬁle.
Unlike the SC of LP01-like mode, the SC of LP02-like mode

the phase mismatch curve (Δ𝛽) between the soliton and the
DW including the ionization eﬀect is shown in Fig. 3(a). The
phase mismatch can be expressed as [26]:

where 𝛽0 is the propagation constant at the soliton centre
frequency 𝜔0, 𝛾 is the nonlinear ﬁber parameter at the pump
wavelength [10], 𝑃𝑝 is the soliton peak power of the com-
pressed pulse, 𝑛0 is the linear refractive index of the medium,
𝜌𝑐𝑟
is the critical plasma density [29]. It can be
seen from Fig. 3(a) that the phase matching occurs at 200 nm
which agrees well with the DW wave emission seen from the
power spectral density (PSD) curve of Fig. 3(b). It should
be noted that when the ionization eﬀect is considered the
phase matching condition occurred at longer wavelengths since
the pump soliton shifts toward the blue side [28] (see Fig. 2
(middle row)).

The DW eﬃciency and plasma density of LP01 and LP02-
like modes are shown in Fig. 4(a-b). The DW eﬃciency of
LP02-like mode is >35% whereas the eﬃciency of LP01-like
mode is around 15%. The dramatic enhancement of the DW
emission for LP02-like mode is due to the strong shock eﬀect
and ionization-induced blue-shift [28]. The plasma density
of LP02-like mode is above >1018 cm−3 at the maximum
temporal compression point which is enough to ionize the
gas. The free electron generation decays drastically after the
temporal compression as it propagates through the ﬁber due to
the high ionization loss. However, at the temporal compression
point, the plasma density of LP01-like mode is only 1014 cm−3.

is narrower at the longer wavelengths that can be seen after the
temporal compression which is due to the high ionization loss
[28]. The spectral and temporal evolution of LP02-like mode
without ionization is shown in Fig. 2 (bottom row). When the
ionization eﬀect was not considered, DW is not generated in
the UV regime since the energy of the compressed pulse is
not suﬃcient to phase match to the DW. It turns out that the
ionization eﬀect is responsible for the generation of DW for
LP02-like mode and plays an important role of DW generation.

followed by SC spanning 200–1500 nm. The formation of
extreme shock eﬀect and plasma induced blue-shifted soliton
leads to an eﬃciency of >35%. The numerical modeling
predicts that it requires only 3.6 cm of ﬁber to generate the
DW. The DW can be further blue-shifted if higher LP0𝑛 are
excited but requires more pump energy to phase match the
soliton and DW. The results presented in this work may be
valuable towards the development of compact, bright, and
highly eﬃcient UV light source.

In conclusion, a new approach to enhance the eﬃciency of
a DW generated in the UV regime by exciting LP02-like mode
in Ar-ﬁlled HC-ARF has been demonstrated. The numerical
modelings are based on the experimentally feasible ﬁber and
pulse parameters that can predict DW generation at 200 nm
