Abstract: 
The LPMWPC can be used as the  ΔE detector for the low-energy charged particle detection. In 
order to increase the transmittance, the wires were adopted as the cathode. This work investigated 
the LPMWPC signal characteristics of this configuration and measured the gas gain with a mixture 
of 90%Ar and 10% CO2 from 1E3 to 1E5 Pa. From the test, the second pulse after the avalanche 
signal was observed, which proved to be caused by the ions’ drifting near the cathode wire.

1 Introduction 

In the nuclear data measurements and nuclear physics experiments, the  ΔE-E is 
an effective method for charged particle identification. Usually, a thin silicon was used 
as the  ΔE detector with a threshold about several MeVs. [1-2] To detect the even lower 
energy charged particle, the gas-based Ionization Chamber (IC), which has the larger 
active  area  and  the  lower  materials,  is  a  solution.  [3-4]  The  signal  of  the  IC  is 
proportional to the deposited energy of the incident particle, which is depended on the 
thickness and pressure of the working gas. To gain a better Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), 
the  higher  gas  pressure  and  the  thicker  volume  are  needed.  But  for  the  low-energy 
charged  particle  detection,  a  vacuum  environment  is  usually  required.  The 
corresponding gas sealing window of the IC is also tens microns, which will stop the 
low-energy charged particle or cause a lot of energy consumption. The lower pressure 
IC  has  a  thinner  window,  but  less  the  energy  deposited.  Meanwhile,  the  size  of  the 
detector is limited in the vacuum chamber.   

The Low-Pressure Multi-Wired Proportional Chamber (LPMWPC) has a large gas 
gain. It means that the avalanched signal as low as tens of keVs can be obtained in the 
LPMWPC, which is equivalent to only thousands of primary ionizations. Since 1971, 
a  series  of  experiments  had  been  performed  to  investigate  the  energy  and  time 
resolution of LPMWPC. [5-12] 

An  LPMWPC-based  Δ E-E  telescope  array  was  developed  at  Back-n  white 
neutron source. With this telescope array, several experiments were accomplished, and 
the  lowest  energy  detection  was  0.5  MeV  for  protons  and  1.01  MeV  for  7Li.  The 
pressures of the LPMWPC can be tuned from 1E3 Pa to 1E5 Pa for different production 
measurements. [13-14] 

During  the  testing,  the  different  characteristics  of  the  LPMWPC  was  observed. 
The following paragraphs describe the detector construction, the observed signal and 
the  gas  gain  testing.  Some  simple  derivations  to  illustrate  this  phenomenon  are  also 
included.   

2 The LPMWPC construction 

The LPMWPC consists of three same electrodes, two grounded for cathodes (top 
and bottom), and one for the anode (in the middle). Each electrode is made of the gold-
coated tungsten wires with a diameter of 25 μm. The wires are welded in every 2 mm 
on a hollow PCB which has an empty area of 30×30 mm2. All wires on a frame are 
connected and read out together. Nylon spacers keep a gap of 2 mm between each frame. 
A Si-PIN detector with a thickness of 300  μm is placed behind the LPMWPC as the 
total energy detector. The photo of a  ΔE-E telescope as shown in Fig. 1. The thin PET-
film windows from 0.5 to 6 μm keep the working gas mixture at various pressures. A 
stainless-steel woven mesh outside of the box with 52% transmittance is employed to 
support  the  window  in  the  vacuum  chamber.  This  pressure-tunable  design  helps  the 
LPMWPC get adequate deposited energy (normally >20 keV) from different (n, lcp) 
measurements. Meanwhile, it also ensures that most of the charged particles can travel 

 
through the LPMWPC and stop in the Si-PIN detector. Because the flammable gas is 
strictly prohibited in the tunnel, in the test the gas mixture of 90% argon and 10% CO2 
was filled in the LPMWPC.

diameter of 20 mm followed as the total E detector 

3 Characteristics of Signals 

Followed tests were performed with a  241Am α source. The LPMWPC is biased 
through a charge sensitive preamplifier “MPR-1” from the Mesytec GmbH & Co [15]. 
The output of the preamplifier is digitized by the General-Purpose Readout Electronics 
(GPRE from USTC). [16] A customized Digital Signal Processing (DSP) network based 
on  the  ROOT  software  handles  all  digital  waveforms  from  the  detector.  This  DSP 
contains a simple smoothing, a high pass, and five low-pass filters to make the signal a 
semi-Gaussian distribution. Fig. 2 shows the waveform before and after the DSP at the 
pressures of 1E5 (the normal pressure MWPC), 2E4, and 3E3 Pa. 

 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. The MWPC works at different pressures, leading to different signal waveforms. The gas pressures 

are 1E5, 2E4, and 3E3 Pa from top to bottom. The plots on the left (a, c, e) show the original waveform, 
while the waveform after the DSP on the right (b, d, f) with the X-axis in nanosecond. 

It can be noticed from the original waveforms Fig.2 (a) and (c) that there are slow 
risings (ion tail) after the signal, which are caused by the ions’ slow drifting. The rising 
turned more significant with the lower pressure, due to the faster velocity of the ions. 
At even lower pressure (3E3 Pa) shown in Fig.2 (e), a second pulse was observed in 
microseconds after the first pulse.   

This phenomenon has been described in reference [17], and briefly illustrated in 
Fig. 3. Avalanche occurs near the surface of the anode wire, typically tens or hundreds 
of microns, which is depended on the electric field and the pressure  (as the reduced 
field  E/p).  While  the  electrons  are  collected  by  the  anode  wire  immediately,  the 
avalanche ions drift away. Both of the charge motions cause the first pulse. While the 
ions  go  through  the  weak  field  area,  an  ion  tail  is  induced,  especially  in  a  charge 
sensitive preamplifier. When the ions approaching the vicinity of the cathode wire, and 
a more rapid signal (the second pulse) is generated due to the higher field. Under lower 
pressures,  the  reduce  electric  field  E/p  can  be  much  larger  than  normal,  leading  a 
significant ion induced signal.   

 
 
 
Fig. 3. The schematic of the second pulse in the LPMWPC waveform 

Since  the  ion  spends  most  of  time  in  travelling  through  the  low  field  area.  By 
simplification similar to the parallel plate electric field, the time interval  τ  between 
the two signals can be approximated as:[18]

                                                      (1) 

Where d is the gap between anode and cathode planes,  μ0 is the mobility of the 
ions, U is the bias voltage. From waveforms after the PSD, the time interval between 
peaks can be obtained. For instance, Fig. 4 shows the voltage-dependent waveforms at 
a constant pressure of 1E4 Pa. 

Fig. 4. The waveforms vary from different biases at a constant pressure of 1E4 Pa. In each plot, the black 

curve is the original pulse, while the red one is after the PSD. The vertical axis is in an arbitrary unit. The 
horizontal axis is time in nanoseconds. 

The experimental velocity of ions in this test has a linear correlation with the E/p 

as Fig. 5 shown.

First peak height (H1) and second peak height (H2) in Fig.4 can be measured from 
the waves. Different from the first pulse, only ions’ drifting, especially near the cathode 
wire, induces the second pulse. The ratio of H2/H1 represents a ions’ rough contribution 
of  the  total  induced  charge. Table.  1  lists  some  H2/H1  from  the  tests  with  different 
pressures and biases. H2/H1 decreases with the reduced electric field.

From a micro perspective, with a higher reduced electric field, the avalanche starts 
in the farther range from the anode wire. This leads the electrons induced more charge. 
At even lower pressure (<1E3 Pa), the electrons’ signal becomes the dominant and rapid 
enough for timing. Therefore, the LPMWPC is often employed as the timing detector 
before. [5-9]   

4 Gas gain 

To get the primary ionization, a voltage of 50 V was applied on the LPMWPC, in 
which the detector works in the ionization mode. The relation between signal amplitude 
and the gas pressure was obtained as in Fig. 6. The 5.41 MeV  particle penetrates the 
gas chamber, so the energy deposited in  LPMWPC has an almost linear  relationship 
with the gas pressure.   

 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 6. With 50 V bias, the LPMWPC is working in the ionization mode, and the primary ionizations are 

not amplified. We obtain a linear relationship between the signal amplitude and pressure, namely the 

energy deposited is proportional to the gas density.   

Fig.  7  demonstrates  the  normalized  gas  gain  curve  at  various  pressures.  The 
multiplication (gas gain) increases with the bias, the trend follows an approximately 
exponential function. In this multiplication calculation, only the H1 is counted as the 
signal amplitude. The multiplication slope decreases with the increasing pressure. 

Fig. 7. The gas gain test results from 1E3 to 1E5 Pa. The signal is normalized with the primary ionization. 

The detector multiplication factor increases with the increasing bias in each pressure test. 

5 Discussion 

In order to minimize the energy loss of incident particles, it is the best to use the 
wires as the cathode. In this case, the second pulse caused by ions’ drifting is the main 
reason that affects the particle resolution, which might be mistaken for an accumulated 

 
 
 
 
 
physical event. The preliminary test of LPMWPC can help confirm the time interval 
and the ratio of the second peak to signal. In principle, it improves the particle resolution 
of the ΔE-E detector.   

A good example is the results from 10B (n, alpha) 7Li experiment in reference [14], 
where the LPMWPC worked at 3000 Pa. At this pressure, a significant double pulse is 
shown as in Fig.8 (a), with a time interval of 2 microseconds. A simple and effective 
way to solve this problem is to increase the integration time of the PSD, as in the Fig. 
8 (b).   

Fig. 8. A preamplifier waveform after the PSD, with different integration constants.   

But at a higher count rate environment, the cathode with a thin metalized film is 

also a compromise instead. 

On the other hand, the time difference contains information of the mobility of ions. 
It is a possible way for the velocity measurements of ions. Moreover, the ratio of the 
two peaks indicates the avalanche propagation around the wire. It offers a possibility to 
study the avalanche process and gas characteristics.
