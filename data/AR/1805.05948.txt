ABSTRACT

Using HINODE/XRT, GOES, SDO/AIA observations, we study a compact C-1.4 class ﬂare outside
a major sunspot of AR 12178 on 4 October 2014. This ﬂare is associated with a peculiar coronal jet,
which is erupted in two stages in the overlying corona above the compact ﬂaring region. At the time
of ﬂare maximum, the ﬁrst stage of the jet eruption occurs above the ﬂare energy release site, and
thereafter in the second stage its magneto-plasma system interacts with the overlying distinct magnetic
ﬁeld domain in its vicinity to build further the typical jet plasma column.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares are magneticlly driven transients, which can release huge amount of energy in few minutes to few tens
of minutes (Shibata & Magara 2011). Generally ﬂares occur in strong magnetic ﬁeld regions (i.e., active regions), but
sometimes they also occur in spotless regions (Dodson & Hedeman 1970). Flare process may emit whole electromagnetic
spectrum, energetic particles, and can accompanied with various physical processes, e.g., chromospheric evaporation,
plasmoid generation, waves & oscillations, jet/surge eruption, etc. In the present paper, we brieﬂy describe a compact
C-class ﬂare that gives rise a peculiar two stage jet eruption.

2. OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND ITS ANALYSES

For this paper, we use observational data from X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard Hinode (Golub et al.2007; Kosugi
et al. 2007) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) (Lemen et al. 2012) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) (Pesnell, Thompson, & Chamberlin 2012) in three EUV wavelengths 304˚A , 171˚A and in 211˚A . XRT observes
solar plasma with temperatures between 1 and 10 MK with 1′′pixel size. AIA has 0.6′′pixel resolution and it operates
with 12 sec cadence in EUV channels. We also use GOES data to show the evolution of the compact C1.4-class solar
ﬂare.

Figure 2. SDO/AIA Composite images in 304˚A , 171˚A , 211˚A show the two-stage jet eruption associated with C-1.4 class
solar ﬂare.

Fig.1 shows HINODE/XRT image at ﬂare peak time (10:21 UT) on 2014-10-04, which demonstrates that C-1.4 class
compact ﬂare has an energy release in a very localized region on the south-east bouldary of AR 12178 outside its
major sunspot. We have plotted GOES light curve for duration of one hour from 10:00UT to 11:00UT in soft x ray
(1.0-8.0 ˚A ) showing the temporal evolution of ﬂare Xray emissions. GOES ﬂux peaks out at 10:21 UT indicating
ﬂare maximum. Total time duration of this ﬂare is 8 min between 10:16 UT to 10:24 UT. Fig.2 shows a two-stage jet
eruption in the composite image of SDO/AIA at 10:24 UT. The ﬁrst stage of jet is erupted from the same location
where this ﬂare triggers. Basically right footpoint of this jet and C-1.4 Class ﬂare are found to be co-spatial. The
ﬂare maximum concides with the initiation time of the ﬁrst stage of jet eruption. In the second stage, the eruptive jet
above the ﬂaring region further interacts with the overlying distinct magnetic ﬁeld domain in its vicinity to create the
typical coronal jet moving outwards along spine ﬁeld lines. The triggering mechanism of this two stage jet eruption
puts rigid constraint on the existing models, and its detailed analysis is under progress by Solanki et al. (2018).
