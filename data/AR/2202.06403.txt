Abstract

Underground argon (UAr) with lower cosmogenic activities of 39Ar and 42Ar has
been planned as a detector in detecting scintillation light and charge collection us-
ing time projection chambers for dark matter searches and as a veto detector in
suppressing backgrounds for neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) experiments.
Long-lived radioactive isotopes, 39Ar and 42Ar, can also be produced on the sur-
face when UAr is pumped out from a deep well. Understanding the production of
long-lived isotopes in Ar is important for utilizing UAr for dark matter and 0νββ
experiments in terms of its production, transportation, and storage. Ar exposure to
cosmic rays at sea-level is simulated using Geant4 for a given cosmic ray muon, neu-
tron, and proton energy spectrum. We report the simulated cosmogenic production
rates of 39Ar, 42Ar, and other long-lived isotopes at sea-level from fast neutrons, high
energy muons, and high energy protons. Total production rates of 938.53/kgAr·day
and 5.81×10−3/kgAr·day for 39Ar and 42Ar are found from our simulation. Utilizing
these production rates, we set a time limit of 954 days constrained by the produc-
tion of 39Ar for UAr to be on the surface before it compromises the sensitivity for
a dark matter experiment. Similarly, a time limit of 1702 days constrained by the
production of 42Ar is found for a 0νββ experiment.

Introduction

Observational evidence indicates that dark matter accounts for approximately
85% of the matter in our universe[1,2,3]. But the nature of dark matter is still
mysterious. Of all the dark matter candidates, the Weakly Interacting Mas-
sive Particle (WIMP) seems promising and is favored by scientiﬁc communi-
ties. Assuming the WIMP is a new elementary particle, which is ubiquitous
in galaxies, it could be directly detected through its elastic recoils on ordinary
matter[4,5]. Many dark matter experiments are actively seeking WIMP scat-
tering events but none have succeeded so far [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25].
DAMA/LIBRA has been claiming for decades that the observation of the an-
nual modulation in the detection is the recoil signal stroked by WIMPs [26],
although their claim is not conﬁrmed by any other experiments. To further
push dark matter detection sensitivities, the next generation large-scale dark
matter experiments are being built aiming at the WIMP-nucleon cross section
down to the level of 10−48 cm2 [27,28,29]. This level of sensitivity also reaches
the ﬂoor of the neutrino background due to coherent neutrino induced nuclear
recoils in the detector [30,31]. In order to achieve such detection sensitivity,
large-scale detectors with hundreds of ton-years exposure under an ultra-low
background environment are needed. For example, DarkSide-20k, which will
use underground argon (UAr) as the target [29], is a two-phase liquid Ar
detector with a 23 tonnes active volume.

The experiments seeking to measure the half-life of neutrinoless double-beta
decay (0νββ) aim to determine the Majorana nature of the neutrino and help
understand the absolute neutrino masses and their mass hierarchy[32,33,34,35].
No discovery has been made by current 0νββ experiments with the sensitivity
of the decay half-life up to ∼ 1026 years [36]. This sets an upper limit on the ef-
fective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino less than 0.2 eV[36,37,38,39,40].
A future large-scale experiment, LEGEND-1000, with increased sensitivity up
to 1028 years has been proposed [41]. This aims for a sensitivity of 0.01 event
per ton per year in the region of interest. Aiming at such detection sensitivity,
instrumental backgrounds from radioactive isotopes need to be well suppressed
and understood. LEGEND-1000 plans to use UAr as the active veto detector.

Both dark matter and 0νββ experiments require their background rate at
the region of interest to be extremely low. The instrumental background from
long-lived radioactive isotopes in detector components must be minimized and
accurately measured. In addition, cosmogenic activation can add more radioac-
tivities to the background budget. Liquid Ar, a relatively cheap noble liquid
scintillator, is a widely used medium for the detection of ionizing radiation.
Taking advantage of its high ionization yield and characteristic scintillation
time proﬁle [42], liquid Ar is utilized as an active target or scintillation veto
material in dark matter searches and 0νββ experiments [12,25,29,36,41]. The

2

problematic issue is that there are long-lived radioactive isotopes existing in
Ar when it is produced on the surface. Both 39Ar (t1/2=269 years) and 42Ar
(t1/2=32.9 years) are produced through cosmogenic activation [43,44]. The
isotopic abundance of 39Ar in atmospheric argon is at a level of (8.1±0.6)
×10−16g/g, which results in a decay rate of ∼1 Bq/kg in a liquid Ar detec-
tor [12,25]. It is a pure β decay to a stable daughter nucleus (39K). This decay
rate and the β decay Q value of 565.5 keV produce background and pile-up
concerns in the detectors for dark matter searches. On the other hand, 42Ar
was measured by the Gerda collaboration and the isotopic abundance is de-
termined at a level of (9.2+2.2
−4.6)×10−21 g/g. More recent measurement from
the DEAP collaboration shows the speciﬁc activity of 42Ar to be 40.4 ± 5.9
µBq/kg [46] which is lower than the GERDA’s result of (88+21
−44) µBq/kg. Its
decay product, 42K, a β emitter with a decay Q value of 3.52 MeV, is a
background to 0νββ decay experiments when using liquid argon as a veto
detector [36]. Note that a fraction of 42Ar could be produced in the Earth’s
atmosphere due to nuclear bomb tests from 1945 to 1962 [43]. The concentra-
tion of 42Ar after bomb testing is estimated to be ∼ 10−22 to ∼10−23 atoms per
natAr atoms [43]. This is only ∼1% to ∼10% of the measured concentration of
42Ar [46,43]. The current 42Ar in Earth’s atmosphere is dominated by spalla-
tion reactions from the cosmic ray nucleon component through 40Ar(α, 2p)42Ar
process.

To obtain Ar with a lower level of 39Ar and 42Ar, it is natural to explore
Ar which has been deep underground where Ar has existed for thousands of
years [45]. Since the production of 39Ar depends on the depth of underground
wells and the surrounding rock condition in terms of its porosity, UAr may not
always have a low level of 39Ar [45]. Because the production of 42Ar is mainly
through 40Ar(α,2p)42Ar and the interaction threshold energy of α particles
is above 12 MeV, it is expected that the production of 42Ar is strongly sup-
pressed in deep underground since there are no α particles with energy greater
than 12 MeV from natural radioactivity decays. Amazingly, the UAr with low
radioactivity produced by the DarkSide collaboration [47] in Colorado of the
United States has shown a reduction of 1400 in 39Ar when compared to atmo-
spheric Ar. Note that the UAr produced elsewhere may not have such a low
level of 39Ar [45]. Although there is no measured reduction factor of 42Ar re-
ported from the UAr produced by DarkSide, it is expected that the reduction
of 42Ar should be at least a factor of 1400 [41]. Therefore, the UAr produced by
DarkSide in Colorado is particularly valuable for DarkSide-20k and LEGEND-
1000. To keep low level of 39Ar and 42Ar for underground experiments, any
potential production processes should be carefully examined and suppressed
since 39Ar and 42Ar are mainly produced through cosmogenic processes when
Ar is on the surface [43,44], precise calculations of cosmogenic activation are
needed to determine the maximum tolerable surface exposure time of argon
during its production, transport and storage.

3

In this paper, we evaluate cosmogenic production of radioactive isotopes in
Ar. The production rates of 39Ar, 42Ar, and other long-lived isotopes from
fast neutrons, high energy muons, and high energy protons are obtained using
Geant4-based simulations. The results are also compared with some experi-
mental data.

2 Evaluation of cosmogenic production in Ar

2.1 Evaluation tools and input sources

GEANT4 (V10.7p02) with shielding modular physics list [48,49] is used for
this study. It includes a set of electromagnetic and hadronic physics processes
for high energy or high precision simulation needs. G4MuonNuclearProcess is
activated to simulate the muon-nuclear interactions.

Cosmic ray muon ﬂux at sea level can be parameterized using Gaisser’s formula[50].
It assumes a ﬂat Earth which is only valid for muons with energy Eµ > 100GeV
(see Fig. 1). In our simulation, the input muons are sampled by using the
modiﬁed Gaisser’s formula[51]. The total muon ﬂux is normalized to 0.015
cm−2s−1 with energy spanning from 1 GeV to 100 TeV. Stop muons are not
included in the simulation due to their relatively small contribution to the
total cosmogenic activation budget for Ar.

The input fast neutrons with energy greater than 4 MeV are adopted from
the ground-based neutron ﬂux measurements at a reference location at sea
level, New York City (NY data)[54]. The total ﬂux is normalized to be 0.004
cm−2s−1. It is worth mentioning that the MeV neutrons may slightly vary
from location to location due to local radioactivities such as neutron yield
from (α, n) process in materials.

Cosmic ray proton induced activation in Ar is also simulated although the
number of protons below a few GeV is much less than the number of neutrons
in the atmosphere (see Fig. 2). The proton spectrum is harder than the neutron
one with energies exceeding a few GeV. The input cosmic ray proton ﬂux is
adopted from the result of MCNPX [55] simulation code. Protons with energy
Ep > 10 MeV are sampled for our use.

2.2 Cosmogenic activation in Ar

Commercial Ar is mostly extracted from the Earth’s atmosphere. It consists
primarily of the stable isotopes 40Ar, 36Ar, and 38Ar. Although natural argon

formula[50]. The solid line stands for the modiﬁed Gaisser’s formula[51]. As a com-

BESS[53] are also presented.

is stable, it suﬀers from cosmic-ray bombardment at the earth’s surface. Ar
radionuclides produced by cosmogenic activation, such as 37Ar, 39Ar and 42Ar,
are irreducible and turn out to be a signiﬁcant source of background for low-
background Ar-based radiation detectors. To eﬀectively suppress cosmogenic
activation, switching from atmospheric Ar to deep UAr had been proposed for
DarkSide-20k and LEGEND-1000. Signiﬁcant production of ultra-low back-
ground Ar extracted and puriﬁed from deep CO2 wells has been successfully
developed. It achieves a factor of 1400 reduction (or 0.73 mBq/kgAr) over at-
mospheric argon in terms of their 39Ar concentration[57]. However, the cosmo-
genic production rates are still critical and need to be accurately calculated
to optimize the surface exposure time during its production, shipping and
storage. Note that 37Ar is not so dangerous for dark matter and 0νββ decay
experiments due to its shorter half-life (35 days).

A comprehensive Geant4 (V10.7p02) simulation has been conducted to eval-
uate the cosmogenic activation rate in an Ar target. Geant4 default material
”G4 lAr” (40Ar:99.604%; 36Ar:0.334%; 38Ar:0.063%) is selected and stored in
a thin cylinder tank that is 2.0 m in diameter and 2.0 m in height. The liquid
argon has the density of 1.40 g/cm3 which gives the total mass of ∼8.80 ton
per cylinder. The cosmic-ray muons, neutrons and protons are considered as
inputs at the top of the Ar target.

City (NY data)[54]. Blue squares are Monte Carlo generated proton spectrum

The production of 39Ar in 40Ar is through the reaction of 40Ar(n, 2n(cid:48))39Ar
when high energy neutrons (>10 MeV) bombard the Ar target. This reaction
is expected to be seen in the Geant4 simulation. A main purpose of this
simulation is to determine if 42Ar can be seen in the Geant4 simulation since
the production rate of 42Ar is extremely small. The long-lived argon isotope
42Ar undergoes a β decay with a half-life of 32.9 years. The β decay of its
daughter isotope, 42K, has a maximum electron energy of 3.52 MeV which
becomes a vital background for 0νββ experiments in the region of interest
(Qββ = 2.039M eV for 0νββ decay from 76Ge)[41] when using liquid Ar as
a veto detector. It is understood that 42Ar is mainly produced through the
reaction channel 40Ar(α, 2p)42Ar with a Q-value of -12.77 MeV[43,44]. This
means that the α particles that can generate 42Ar in 40Ar must have kinetic
energies greater than 12.77 MeV.

In order to see the production of 42Ar in our simulation in a reasonable
computing time (one month) in the high precision computing cluster with
72 CPUs at the University of South Dakota, all particles with energy less
than 12 MeV are killed (tracks stop and kill). Therefore, our results exclude
all capture processes. For example 36Ar(n,γ)37Ar is not found in our simu-
lation. We found that the cosmogenic production rate of 42Ar results in a

of 3.88 × 10−12 Bq/kgAr/day. This shows that the Geant4 simulation is able
to predict the production of 42Ar. We summarize the three long-lived argon
isotopes in Table 1 and other long-lived isotopes in Table 2.

As can be seen from the results shown in Table 1 and 2, the production rates of
long-lived isotopes in Ar is dictated by high energy neutrons. The production
rate of 39Ar by fast neutrons from this work is in a reasonable agreement with
the measurement made by Saldanha et al. [58]. However, the production rate
of 37Ar by neutrons is diﬀerent from Saldanha et al. by a factor of ∼3. The
discrepancy is caused by the diﬀerent 40Ar(n,4n)37Ar production cross section
used in the process. This interaction cross section has not been experimentally
measured.

The total production rate of 39Ar measured by Saldanha et al. [58] (934.6±156.2
atoms/kg·day) is in a good agreement with this work (938.53 atoms/kg·day)
using the Geant4 simulation. To validate the simulated production rate of
42Ar from this work, we compared the cross section of 40Ar(α, 2p)42Ar from a
measurement made by Yuki et al. [59], the ALICE code [60], a nuclear reaction
simulator - TALYS [61], and a nuclear database - ENDF [62] as shown in Fig-
ure 3. The cross section extracted from Geant4 increases as the kinetic energy
of α particles increases. This tendency is similar to the experimental data [59]
and the ALICE code. However, the value of the cross section extracted from
Geant4 is diﬀerent by a factor of 2 to 5 (depending on energy) from the avail-
able data provided by Yuki et al. and a factor of ∼2 from the ALICE code.
Note that the cross section obtained from the TALYS code is signiﬁcantly

diﬀerent from Geant4, the ALICE code, and the available data. The ENDF-6
database only provides the cross section for energy below 30 MeV. Thus, we
can conclude that the cross section of 40Ar(α, 2p)42Ar is not well understood
and more experimental data are needed. Nevertheless, the Geant4 simulation
conﬁrms the production of 42Ar on the Earth’s surface through the secondary
α particles from cosmic ray muons, neutrons, and protons. Note that the cal-
culated rates of 42Ar production in the atmospheric argon at sea level cannot
be directly compared to the experimentally observed abundance of 42Ar. This
is because 42Ar is mainly produced at the top of the atmosphere where the
primary cosmic ray ﬂuxes are signiﬁcantly larger than terrestrial cosmic ray
ﬂuxes [63]. In addition, the energy spectra of the primary cosmic ray ﬂuxes at
the top of the atmosphere are much harder than that of the cosmic rays at sea
level. Therefore, the experimental observed abundance of 42Ar is signiﬁcant
larger than the calculated rates of 42Ar production at sea level.

2.3 Tolerable Exposure Time Limit

One can use the production rates of 39Ar and 42Ar obtained from this work to
set the allowed exposure time for UAr on the surface in terms of production,
transportation, and storage. Since the UAr produced by DarkSide in Colorado

Fig. 3. Shown is a comparison for the cross section of 40Ar(α, 2p)42Ar extracted
from Geant4 with the experimental measurement (Yuki et al. [59]), as well as that
of ALICE [60], TALYS [61] and ENDF-6 [62].

is depleted in 39Ar by a factor of 1400 when compared to atmospheric Ar, we
can also expect that the concentration of 42Ar is depleted by at least a factor
of 1400. Therefore, the cosmogenic production of 39Ar and 42Ar in the UAr
should be controlled in a level of less than 10% of the existing concentration
of 39Ar and 42Ar in the UAr produced by DarkSide. This level of additional
cosmogenic production in the UAr will not compromise its sensitivity for the
planned DarkSide-20k and LEGEND-1000.

Using a constraint of 10% additional cosmogenic production of 39Ar and 42Ar
in the UAr, we estimate the allowed exposure time using the formula be-
low [64]:

N (t) =

R
λ

[1 − exp(−λt)],

(1)

where N (t) is the additional number of atoms (10% of the existing 39Ar or
42Ar in the UAr) produced in the UAr through cosmogenic activation when
the UAr is on the surface during the production, transportation, and storage,
R is the production rate from the Geant4 simulation, λ is the decay constant,
and t is the allowed exposure time. Note the 10% of the existing 39Ar in
the UAr is calculated using the atmospheric level of 8.1×10−16g/g divided
by 1400 and multiplied by 10%. Similarly, the 10% of the existing 42Ar in the

represent the reduction factor of 1400 in terms of its 42Ar and 39Ar concentration

UAr is calculated using the atmospheric level of 9.2×10−21g/g divided by 1400
(assuming an upper limit for a conservative consideration) and multiplied by
10%.

Derived from Eq (1), the allowed exposure time can be expressed as:

t =

ln[1 − N (t)λ/R]
−λ

.

(2)

Using Eq (2), the allowed exposure time for the UAr on the surface are 954 days
in terms of the production of 39Ar and 1702 days in terms of the production
42Ar, respectively. This means that the UAr can be on the surface for more
than two years, which is a quite reasonable time to produce enough UAr before
transporting to underground for storage. Note that the cosmic ray neutron ﬂux
on the Earth’s surface varies with altitude [63], which will aﬀect the production
of 39Ar and 42Ar accordingly. The exposure time limit will change with respect
to diﬀerent altitudes.

One can also show the calculated exposure limits using Eq. 2, for both 42Ar
and 39Ar production at sea level, versus a target activity level since diﬀerent
experiments will have their own target activity levels. Figure 4 displays the
results.

The cosmogenic activations of Ar for the next generation rare event search
experiments at sea level have been simulated using GEANT4 package. Fast
neutrons, muons and protons at the earth surface are considered individually.
The activation rates of 37Ar, 39Ar and 42Ar are compared with the mea-
surement and model predictions[58]. We found that the production rates of
long-lived isotopes through cosmogenic activation on the earth’s surface are
dictated by fast neutrons. Using the production rates of 39Ar and 42Ar from
this work, we set a limit of the exposure time for the UAr on the surface
during its production, transportation, and storage. The limit is 954 days if
the production of 39Ar is a main driver for a dark matter experiment such as
DarkSide-20k. On the other hand, the limit is 1702 days if the production of
42Ar is a main concern for a 0νββ decay experiment such as LEGEND-100
using UAr as a veto. We conclude that the UAr from Colorado discovered
by DarkSide can be exposed on the earth’s surface in terms of production,
transportation, and storage for more than 900 days without compromising
the sensitivity of planned DarkSide-20k and LEGEND-1000 experiments.
