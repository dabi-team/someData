Neutrino oscillation experiments aim to measure the neutrino oscillation parameters with ac-

curacy and achieve a complete understanding of neutrino physics. For determining the neutrino

oscillation parameters, knowledge of neutrino energy is a prerequisite. But neutrino energy needs to

be reconstructed, based on the particles in the ﬁnal state that emerge out of the nucleus following

a neutrino-nucleus interaction. Current and upcoming neutrino oscillation experiments use heavy

nuclear targets (viz. Argon(Ar), Calcium(Ca), etc.) but the neutrino scattering with such targets

becomes complicated as compared to that with a clean target like Hydrogen(H). This work explores

the viability of using machine learning algorithms (MLA) in reconstructing neutrino energy. We

use ﬁnal state kinematics generated from two neutrino event generators viz. GENIE and GiBUU

to train the MLA. We calculate the Ar/H ratio in an attempt to quantify nuclear eﬀects in the Ar

target. We observe a signiﬁcant improvement in our results when we train the MLA by combining

the FSI kinematics of neutrino interactions from both the neutrino event generators.

INTRODUCTION

Neutrino being intrinsically leptonic and neutral is the second most abundant particle in the Universe.

It is a

potential candidate for probing the complex hadronic structure as well as exploring physics beyond the Standard

Model. Precision measurement of its properties and nature of interaction with the other nuclei is among the highest

fundamental particle physics priorities. Several benchmark discoveries employing a variety of nuclear targets in the

past decades have revealed several properties of the neutrino. Active neutrinos are known to exist in three ﬂavors viz.

electron neutrino (νe), muon neutrino (νµ) and tau neutrino (ντ ). A neutrino of a particular ﬂavor, after traveling a

certain distance, transforms into a neutrino of another ﬂavor, this unique property is referred to as neutrino oscillation.

A milestone was achieved with the discovery of neutrino oscillations that substantiated the tiny mass of neutrinos. The

study of neutrino oscillation physics involves certain parameters i.e. mixing angles θij where j > i=1,2,3 (θ12, θ13, θ23),
Dirac phase δCP and mass squared diﬀerences i.e. ∆m2

21 known as
solar mass splitting. Some of the neutrino oscillation parameters have been measured precisely i.e. θ12, θ23, non-
zero value of θ13 [1–3] and magnitude of mass squared diﬀerences ∆m2

31|. While the neutrino oscillation
parameters which are yet to be discovered with precision are- (i) the value of dirac phase δCP : which can lie in the
range −π < δCP < π (ii) the neutrino mass ordering i.e. sign of ∆m2

31: there is a possibility of neutrino mass ordering
being ’normal’ i.e. whether the neutrino mass order can be- m1 (cid:28) m2 (cid:28) m3 known as normal mass hierarchy (NH) or

31 known as atmospheric mass splitting and ∆m2

21, |∆m2

the ordering can be ’inverted’ i.e. the neutrino mass order can be- m2 ≈ m1 (cid:29) m3 known as inverted mass hierarchy

(IH), where mi(i=1,2,3) are neutrino mass eigenstates (iii) octant degeneracy i.e. whether the value of θ23 lies in the

lower octant(LO) 0 < θ23 < π/4 or higher octant(HO) π/4 < θ23 < π/2. The current status of the neutrino oscillation

parameters estimated by performing a global ﬁt can be found in [4]. Qualitative improvement in the measurement of

the unknown neutrino oscillation parameters requires pinning down the systematic uncertainties which become more

challenging with the use of heavy nuclear targets (mass number(A)>12).

For precise determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters at neutrino oscillation experiments, it is crucial

to accurately determine the energy of the incoming neutrino since the neutrino oscillation probability depends upon

the neutrino energy spectrum. In beam-based collider/accelerator experiments we need to reconstruct the energy of

the neutrino since neutrinos are produced as secondary decay products from primarily produced hadrons that lead

to non-monoenergetic and broad neutrino beams. To reconstruct the energy of a neutrino, the energy of all the ﬁnal

state particles produced in a neutrino-nucleus interaction must be taken into account on an event-by-event basis. An

obstacle for precise neutrino energy reconstruction from the ﬁnal state particles is the inability to correctly identify

the particle conﬁguration, dynamics, and kinematics of a neutrino interaction within the nucleus. The particles that

are produced at the initial neutrino nucleon interaction vertex within the nucleus are often modiﬁed inside the nuclear

environment. When a neutrino interacts with a nucleon (which is not at rest) inside the nucleus certain nuclear eﬀects

[5] come into play such as fermi motion, Pauli blocking, multinucleon eﬀects [6] at the initial interaction vertex.

Moreover, as the particles produced at initial neutrino-nucleon interaction travel through the nucleus they re-interact

with other nucleons and emerge out of the nucleus as diﬀerent particles known as ﬁnal state particles. Collectively,

these eﬀects are known as nuclear eﬀects [7]. As a result, the kinematics and dynamics of the real interaction remain

unknown. Thus the physics of neutrino-nucleus scattering remains tangled and requires a good understanding of

nuclear eﬀects.

Neutrino owing to its weakly interacting nature and very low interaction cross-section is merely detectable. Thus to

study neutrinos at neutrino experiments heavy nuclear targets are used which gives large statistics of neutrino interac-

tion events resulting in reduced statistical uncertainty but at the same time leads to huge systematic uncertainties due

to inherent nuclear eﬀects. For extracting vital information from the large data samples collected from detectors at

neutrino experiments, it is crucial to develop advanced reconstruction techniques. Machine learning algorithms(MLA)

are an integral part of the analysis tools for the past two decades [9]. Signiﬁcant improvement has been witnessed

in the physics reach of the analyses with the use of MLAs. Results obtained from previous generation experiments

[10–14] that involved the application of neural networks [15, 16] and Boosted Decision Trees(BDTs) led the use of

MLAs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [17]. MLAs also played a crucial role in the discovery of the Higgs Boson

[18, 19]. For a much detailed review about the use of MLAs at LHC one can refer to [20].

The upcoming and ambitious long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment i.e. the Deep Underground Neutrino

Experiment (DUNE) [64] is also using MLAs for data analysis. DUNE is currently in the process of being set up

in the Fermilab, United States.

It strives to achieve the most sought-after goals in the realm of particle physics

i.e. the octant degeneracy, neutrino mass hierarchy, value of Dirac δCP phase. It’s prime design consists of a Near

Detector (ND) [21–24] at Fermilab and a Far Detector (FD) [64] to be set up at Sanford Underground Research

Facility (SURF), South Dakota. The design of ND is a ﬁne-grained magnetic spectrometer while the FD will host

four independent 10 kt each, Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs). Both the ND and FD will be

employing Ar as a target with the aim of maximum cancellation of systematic uncertainties. A muon neutrino (or

antineutrino) dominated beam will be focussed from Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at Fermilab to both

iii

the ND and FD set up at a distance of 575 meters and 1300 km respectively. For data analysis at DUNE, advanced

MLAs like Deep learning are being used for interaction vertex reconstruction [25] and kinematic reconstruction [26].

Deep learning is a type of machine learning method based on artiﬁcial neural networks where ’deep’ refers to several

layers in the network. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) [27] is being used for classifying neutrino interactions [28].

A CNN can be deﬁned as a deep neural network that consists of several convolutional layers. The output from each

layer acts as an input for the next layer. To classify neutrino interactions, this technique has proven to be better than

the traditional event-based reconstruction methods [29, 30]. While reconstruction of neutrino energy and ﬁnal state

particle momenta with deep learning methods is still in progress.

To reconstruct the neutrino energy using MLAs, we have used a linear regression model and compared it with the

calorimetric method of energy reconstruction. For our analysis we have selected two diﬀerent simulation tools, GE-

NIE (Generates Events for Neutrino Interaction Experiments) [31] (version-2.12.6) and GiBUU (Giessen Boltzmann-

Uehling-Uhlenbeck) [32] (version-2019). Both GENIE and GiBUU are based on diﬀerent physics approach i.e. they

employ diﬀerent nuclear models to incorporate nuclear eﬀects and various neutrino interaction processes.

In an

attempt to constrain systematic uncertainties in Ar, we have calculated the ratio of Ar/H using calorimetric and

MLA. Further, we have taken a step to check the multi-generator approach and combined the ﬁnal state interaction

(FSI) kinematics as obtained from both generators. Our results show that on adopting a multi-generator approach

systematic uncertainties were signiﬁcantly reduced.

The paper is organized in the following sections: We describe the neutrino event generators GENIE and GiBUU

used in this work in Section II. We outline the simulation, experimental details, and the analysis strategy in Section

III. The results are discussed in Section IV followed by the Conclusions in Section V.

II. NEUTRINO EVENT SIMULATION TOOLS

A neutrino event generator simulates neutrino-nucleus interactions for a particular detector setting and propagates

the products out of the struck nucleus. These generators take into account, both the initial neutrino-nucleon interaction

and the ﬁnal state interactions. Event generators must be eﬃcient enough to simulate interactions on a wide range

of nuclei, for a broad neutrino energy spectrum, for all the neutrino (anti-neutrino) ﬂavors, and must have accurate

energy-dependent cross-section. The role of the event generator becomes crucial as it provides information about the

physics of the interaction taking place. But we lack complete information about the initial neutrino-nucleus interaction

and the subsequent re-interactions taking place within the nucleus that lead to modiﬁed outgoing products. Thus

diﬀerent neutrino event generators incorporate diﬀerent nuclear and physics models to describe the nucleus and the

various energy-dependent interaction processes. Diﬀerent neutrino experiments use diﬀerent neutrino event generators,

for eg. NEUT [33] is used by the T2K experiment, GENIE [31] is used by Fermilab experiments like NOvA [34],

MicroBooNE [35], MINERvA [36], T2K[37] and MINOS[38]. NuWRO [39] is being used for the comparison of

experiments and calculations. Another generator named, GiBUU [32] can be used for a wide range of interactions

between a nucleus- and -neutrino/electron/photon/pion/nucleus.

Our selected event generators i.e. GENIE and GiBUU, considerably diﬀer in the selection of nuclear models

and description of above mentioned neutrino-nucleus interactions. GENIE is developed in C++ language and is a

ROOT[40] based neutrino event generator designed using object-oriented methodologies. Whereas, GiBUU, written

iv

in FORTRAN routines, is based on a coupled set of semiclassical kinetic equations. These equations describe the

dynamics of a hadronic system in phase space and time.

Some diﬀerences and similarities between these two event generators can be outlined as follows. For nuclear density

distribution both the generators use Woods-Saxon parametrization[41]. The value of axial mass used by GiBUU is
MA= 1 GeV /c2 while the value of axial mass in GENIE is 0.99 GeV/c2. The vector form factor, BBBA07 [42] is used by

GiBUU while GENIE uses BBBA05 [43]. To describe the nuclear density distribution, both the generators use Woods-

Saxon parametrization [41]. For simulating QE interactions that are dominant below 1 GeV, RFG model[44] is used to

describe the nuclear structure by both the generators. But the RFG model used in GiBUU has an additional density-

dependent mean-ﬁeld potential term in which all nucleons are assumed to be bound while in GENIE it is based on the

model suggested by A. Bodek and J.L. Ritchie [45] that includes short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations. The QE

scattering in GENIE is modeled according to the Llewellyn Smith model[46]. For the description of QE cross-section

in GiBUU, one can refer to [47, 48]. Below 1 GeV, there is an interplay of other interactions also. Nucleon-nucleon

correlations involving two-particle two-hole (MEC/2p2h) excitations mainly populate in this low energy region [49].

The resonance interaction dominates in the energy range from 0.5 < Eν < 10 GeV. There are 13 variants of

resonance modes in GiBUU and it is the MAID analysis [50, 51] of the electron scattering data that deﬁnes vector

form factors for all the modes. GENIE accommodates 16 resonance modes deﬁned by Rein Sehgal model[52]. At

higher energies, DIS interaction dominates where the interaction is at the quark level. GiBUU and GENIE implement

PYTHIA [53] and Bodek and Yang [54] respectively to describe the DIS process. GENIE incorporates Aivazis, Olness,

and Tung model [55] also, particularly for DIS charm production.

The initially produced particles at the neutrino-nucleon interaction vertex are further modiﬁed due to re-interactions

with other nucleons within the nucleus, such re-interactions are referred to as Final State Interactions (FSI). Both

GENIE and GiBUU apply diﬀerent approaches to model FSI. FSI in GENIE is modeled using the simulation package

INTRANUKE [56–59]. GiBUU models the FSI by the semi-classical BUU equations. A mean-ﬁeld potential and

collision terms keep diﬀerent particle species coupled to each other. Further information on modeling diﬀerences,

corrections, and improvements being implemented in the two generators, one can refer to [60–62].

III. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

For simulating a DUNE-like experiment, we have considered the DUNE-ND ﬂux [63] that spans over an energy range

of 0.125-10 GeV as shown in Figure 1. In this energy range, there is an interplay of several interaction processes viz.

quasi-elastic (QE), resonance (RES) from ∆ resonant decay, and contribution from higher resonances, two particle-two

hole(2p2h/MEC), and deep inelastic scattering(DIS) interaction processes. We have considered all these interaction

processes in our analysis.

The incoming neutrino beam is dominated by muon ﬂavor which is generated at the LBNF facility. At LBNF, a

beam of protons in the energy range 60-120 GeV is produced at the main injector accelerator and is made to smash a

graphite target. This results in the production of pions and kaons which are directed to a decaying pipe with the help

of magnetic horns. These pions and kaons further decay into neutrinos and leptons of all ﬂavors. Finally an intense,

wide-band, ν(¯ν) beam is produced with an initial beam power of 1.2 MW, producing 1.1 × 1021 protons on target

per year [64].

v

Figure 1: The DUNE-ND ﬂux as a function of neutrino energy used in our work.

Inclusive event samples of 1 million νµ-Ar and νµ-H each, are generated using both the neutrino event generators

i.e. GENIE and GiBUU. The choice of nuclear targets is such so that we can quantify nuclear eﬀects in Ar. As we

know DUNE-ND and FD will employ liquid Ar in both the detectors, it is crucial to study neutrino-Ar scattering.

We have selected H because it is a single proton and hence it is devoid of nuclear eﬀects. It is very important to

have a control sample that can directly constrain nuclear eﬀects which can help in reducing systematic uncertainties.

Comparing measurements on Ar and H will impose stringent constraints on the nuclear smearing in Ar. The Straw

Tube Tracker (STT), a component in SAND [24], which is one of the components in the DUNE-ND will be studying

ν-Ar and ν-H interactions along with other nuclear targets (For eg. Ca(A=40), C(A=12)) as well. STT will be using

H in the form of ’solid hydrogen’ and will obtain interaction kinematics with H by subtracting interactions on CH2

[65] and Carbon. This is the motivation behind our selection of targets as, without a complementary H target, it is

diﬃcult to achieve precision measurement free from nuclear smearing. Although the DUNE collaboration does not

have any plan to use an H target in any form in the FD module as planned for the ND complex (SAND), but for

simulation purposes, we have replaced Ar with an H target. We have estimated the probability with H target as a

function of reconstructed neutrino energy using a single generator and multi-generator approach as well. To quantify

the amount of nuclear eﬀect we have further used it for calculating the Ar/H ratio as presented in Figures 6 and 7.

A. Analysis strategy

The following section describes the two analysis techniques that we have applied in our work i.e. Calorimetric and

Linear regression methods.

(GeV)nE12345678910Flux(1/GeV)00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.43-10·1. Calorimetric technique

vi

The calorimetric method [66, 67] of neutrino energy reconstruction estimates the neutrino energy by adding the

energies deposited by all the particles observed in the detector. This method in comparison to the traditional kinematic

method [68–71] of neutrino energy reconstruction is more eﬀective for mainly two reasons. Firstly, the kinematic

method is only restricted to the QE interaction process as it is based on lepton kinematics (outgoing muon) only

while the calorimetric method applies to all types of interaction processes. Secondly, the calorimetric method is in a

way insensitive to nuclear eﬀects while the kinematic method is more prone to nuclear eﬀects for interaction processes

other than QE. But only in an ideal detector where there will be no missing energy i.e. even the particles with the

lowest energies are detected, then only the calorimetric method will reconstruct eﬀectively. Although the impact

of FSI will still be prevalent in neutrino interactions due to which the energy transferred to the nucleus may get

redistributed to several particles but the total energy will remain the same [72].

For calculating the neutrino energy (ECal

ν

) using the calorimetric approach, ECal

ν

[66] can be calculated as:

ECal

ν = El + ΣiT n

i + (cid:15)n + ΣmEm

(1)

where El is the energy of the outgoing ﬁnal state lepton, T n
i

is the kinetic energy of the outgoing nucleons (protons

and/or neutrons), (cid:15)n represents the corresponding separation energies of the outgoing nucleons and Em is the total

energy of any other particle produced. The calorimetric energy in our work is calculated using Eq.(1).

2. Multivariate linear regression

We have applied the multivariate linear regression model which comes under supervised learning. In supervised

learning, we have the required dataset that is the input and have an idea about the output. Linear regression predicts

a real-valued output based on an input value. Our work gives multiple values, known as feature variables in the

input, which is termed as multivariate analysis. A python-based script is developed that takes the FSI kinematics

(features for our algorithm) as an input to train the algorithm and predict the neutrino energy. The multiple features

are the number of particles per event, momenta of all the outgoing particles per event, true neutrino energy, the
energy of outgoing muon (Eµ), energy transfer (q0), visible momenta of each particle, squared four momenta (Q2),

and reconstructed neutrino energy. This dataset is further divided into a training set and testing set as 70% and 30%

respectively. The training set is used to train the MLA and the testing set is used to check the predictions done by

the MLA. The algorithm learns from the input variables about the reconstructed neutrino energy per event and then

predicts the reconstructed neutrino energy in the output based on its learning from the feature variables provided

to it. The regression algorithm performs a mapping between a dependent and an independent variable which is a

continuous mapping and can be used to predict the energy of a particle.

IV. RESULT AND DISCUSSION

On testing the viability of the linear regression method for reconstructing the neutrino energy, we ﬁnd that the

method can competently reconstruct neutrino energy as good as the calorimetric method. Figures 2 and 3, represent

is very well reconstructed using the linear regression method.

unity for the entire energy range.

V. CONCLUSION

Neutrino interaction event rates are a convolution of neutrino ﬂux, neutrino-nucleon cross-section, nuclear eﬀects

and detector response. The ﬁrst three factors depend upon the incoming neutrino energy whereas the detector

response depends upon the eﬃciency and threshold of the detector. Experimentalists use event generators to connect

the observed topologies and interaction kinematics. Due to scarcity of data, there are cross-sectional uncertainties

where unknown fundamental neutrino scattering kinematics further distort vital information that lead to systematic

uncertainties. To construct a precise nuclear model, we need exact information about all the convoluted factors.

We ﬁnd from Figure 6, that the two widely used neutrino event generators, GENIE and GiBUU have non-negligible

systematic uncertainties in their nuclear models and especially in the energy range from 1-3 GeV. QE and RES

interaction processes are the most dominant interactions in this energy range. This energy range has other interaction

processes like multinucleon, 2p-2h, and coherent interactions that are still not modeled properly. We can note that

GENIE results have more ﬂuctuations than GiBUU results, which indicates a larger amount of uncertainties in the

GENIE in the low energy range. From Figure 7, we observe a signiﬁcant improvement in the Ar/H ratio, represented

by green circles. This shows that on combining the FSI kinematics from both the generators, ﬂuctuation in the

ratio was minimal, indicating a signiﬁcant reduction in the systematic uncertainties. A study of high-statistics ν-H

scattering data is necessary to supplement our knowledge of the poorly known nuclear eﬀects. Through this work,

we may conclude that a multi-generator and multi-target approach might be useful to constrain nuclear eﬀects in the

future long-baseline neutrino experiments like DUNE.
