Abstract 

The  solar  activity  during  the  Maunder  Minimum  (MM;  1645–1715)  has  been  considered 

significantly  different  from  the  one  captured  in  modern  observations,  in  terms  of  sunspot  group 

number and sunspot positions, whereas its actual amplitudes and distributions is still under active 

discussions.  In  its  core  period  (1650/1660–1700),  Martin  Fogelius  and  Henrich  Siverus  have 

formed  significant  long-term  series  in  the  existing  databases  with  numerous  spotless  days,  as  the 

13th and 7th most active observers before the end of the MM. In this study, we have analysed their 

original  archival  records,  revised  their  data,  have  removed  significant  contaminations  of  the 

apparent  “spotless  days” 

in 

the  existing  databases,  and  cast  caveats  on 

the  potential 

underestimation  of  the  solar-cycle  amplitude  in  the  core  MM.  Still,  they  reported  at  best  one 

sunspot  group  throughout  their  observational  period  and  confirm  the  significant  suppressed  the 

solar cycles during the MM, which is also supported from the contemporary observations of Hook 

and  Willoughby.  Based  on  the  revised  data,  we  have  also  derived  positions  of  notable  sunspot 

groups,  which  Siverus  recorded  in  1671  (≈  N7.5°  ±  2.5°),  in  comparison  with  those  of  Cassini’s 

drawings (≈ N10° ± 1°). Their coincidence in position and chronology in corrected dates indicates

these sunspot groups were probably the same recurrent active region (AR) and its significantly long 

lifespan (≥ 35 days) even during the MM.

1. Introduction 

The  MM  is  currently  the  only  grand  minimum  captured  in  the  instrumental  sunspot  observations 

since  1610  (Clette  et  al.,  2014;  Hathaway,  2015;  Muñoz-Jaramillo  and  Vaquero,  2019;  Arlt  and 

Vaquero,  2020).  This  epoch  is  characterised  by  significant  scarcity  of  sunspots,  extremely 

asymmetric sunspot positions, and notably weakened solar magnetic activity (Spörer, 1889; Eddy, 

1976; Ribes and Nesme-Ribes, 1993; Riley et al., 2015; Usoskin et al., 2015; Vaquero et al., 2015; 

Hayakawa  et  al.,  2020c,  2020d),  which  is  often  explained  with  special  dynamo  activity  and 

distinguished  from  normal  cycle  minima  or  even  the  Dalton  Minimum  (Usoskin  et  al.,  2015; 

Hayakawa et al., 2020a, 2020b; Petrovay, 2020; Charbonneau, 2020). As the only grand minimum 

with telescopic solar observations, the MM has formed a reference for other grand minima detected 

in the proxy reconstructions from cosmogenic isotopes (e.g., Usoskin et al., 2007, 2014; Inceoglu 

et al., 2015). 

As such, it has been of great interest to analyse direct solar observations during the MM. Since the 

benchmark article of Eddy (1976), Hoyt and Schatten (1996) examined the observational coverage 

of  major  observers  and  incorporated  continuous  spotless  days  during  this  period.  This  result  had 

formed a backbone for reconstruction of the sunspot group number during the MM in the existing 

database (Hoyt and Schatten, 1998 = HS98). Recent recalibrations of sunspot group number have 

required  major  revisions  and  updates  for  the  exiting  datasets  including  this  period  (Clette  et  al., 

2014;  Clette  and  Lefevre,  2016;  Svalgaard  and  Schatten,  2016;  Vaquero  et  al.,  2016  =  V+16). 

Apart from recoveries of forgotten records, recent studies have removed erroneous data and general 

descriptions on continuous spotless days during and around the MM (Carrasco et al., 2015, 2016, 

2019; Vaquero et al., 2011, 2015, 2016; Usoskin et al., 2015; Arlt and Vaquero, 2020).     

These  efforts  have  improved  our  understanding  on  the  MM  and  visualised  its  difference  and 

similarity with other epochs. Despite its suppression, sunspot group number still shows extremely 

weak  cycles  with  their  core  in  1660–1700  (Vaquero  et  al.,  2015;  Svalgaard  and  Schatten,  2016), 

while  the  ratios  of  umbra/penumbra  look  similar  to  the  modern  ones  (Carrasco  et  al.,  2018). 

Sunspot  appearance  was  mostly  concentrated  in  the  southern  solar  hemisphere  or  near  the  solar

equator,  whereas  this  trend  was  probably  not  shared  before  its  onset  or  its  immediate  afterwards 

(Carrasco  et  al.,  2019;  Muñoz-Jaramillo  and  Vaquero,  2019).  Nevertheless,  the  majority  of  the 

existing  discussions  are  devoted  to  its  latter  half  or  recovery  phase  (see  V+16;  Muñoz-Jaramillo 

and  Vaquero,  2019;  Arlt  and  Vaquero,  2020).  Therefore,  analyses  of  the  core  MM  (c.a., 

1650/1660–1700) still improve our understanding on its depth (Vaquero et al., 2015; Svalgaard and 

Schatten,  2016),  which  is  currently  an  active  discussion  topic  (Cliver  and  Ling,  2011;  Lockwood 

and Owens, 2014; Owens et al., 2017).   

In this context, Martinus Fogelius’ and Heinrich Siverus’ observations have formed two long-term 

series interestingly located in 1661–1671 and 1671 – 1690, and were once used to depict the great 

deficit  of  sunspots  in  the  1660s  and  the  early  1680s  (Hoyt  and  Schatten,  1996;  HS98).  However, 

caveats must be noted on their almost continuous spotless days (V+16). In fact, Fogelius has been 

associated with a series of spotless days between 15 October 1661 and 31 July 1671 and Siverus 

with  almost  continuous  spotless  days  with  sporadic  exceptions  between  1675  and  1690.  As  such, 

V+16 casted doubts on their data validity in 1662–1670 among Fogelius’, and that in 1675–1677, 

1679, and 1681–1690 among Siverus’. Still, even removing these data, both Fogelius and Siverus 

have observational data for 318 days and 1040 days and hence have been considered the 13th and 

7th most active observers before the end of the MM (V+16). Their observations are located around 

the beginning of the existing butterfly diagram for sunspot observations in the MM (Spörer, 1889; 

Ribes  and  Nesme-Ribes,  1993;  Muñoz-Jaramillo  and  Vaquero,  2019)  and  will  improve  our 

understanding on the sunspot positions in this epoch.   

Fogelius’ original correspondence has been located in the Royal Society archives as a manuscript 

of MS EL/F1/34. This manuscript shows several unpublished details in Fogelius (1671), clarifying 

the original observer as Siverus and showing one more sunspot plate. Moreover, close inspections 

in  Fogelius’  correspondences  and  historical  accounts  for  Siverus  (Ettmüller,  1693)  show  actual 

availability  of  their  datable  observations.  Therefore,  in  this  article,  we  re-analyse  the  original 

sunspot  records  associated  with  Fogelius,  reveal  the  actual  observer,  revise  the  sunspot  group 

number  and  observational  dates,  derive  sunspot  positions,  and  compare  them  with  contemporary 

observations. 

2. Martin Fogelius’ Sunspot Group Number 

Fogelius’ source documents are derived from Fogelius (1671) and Wolf (1850b), as clarified in the 

supplementary  bibliography  of  HS98.  Among  them,  Fogelius  (1671)  only  involves  a  “plate 

showing course of spot from Aug 26 to Sep 5, 1671” (HS98). As such, majority of Fogelius’s data

Hayakawa et al. 2020, Sunspot Observations of Fogelius and Siverus, 
Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, DOI: 10.1093/mnras/staa2965 

are derived from Wolf (1850b, p. 295), whereas the spotless days are actually “general statements” 

(see Table II of Hoyt and Schatten, 1996) and Hoyt and Schatten (1998) even clarify, “we do not 

know  exactly  what  days  he  was  observing”  (see  HS98’s  bibliographical  supplement).  In  fact, 

Wolf’s original description is translated as follows: “Fogelius in Hamburg still has seen sunspots in 

October 1661. In 1671 Picard [NB Jean Picard] saw spots on 3 August and some following days, 

which were also observed in Hamburg on 7, 8, and 9 August and in Paris on 11, 12, and 13 August. 

On 30 August and 1 September, Hook saw one of these spots return. Siferus [NB Heinrich Siverus] 

in  Hamburg  followed  it  [NB  the  sunspot]  continuously  from  26  August  to  4  September,  and 

Fogelius communicated his observations on November 1st with a remark: ‘Maculae solares iterum 

nobis  apparuerunt,  nunc  tamen  non  amplius  visibiles’  [NB  indicating  Fogelius  (1671)]  ”  (Wolf, 

1850b, p. 295).   

However, close inspection shows that the existing datasets for Fogelius and Siverus in HS98 and 

V+16  are  not  very  robust  considering  their  supplemental  bibliography.  First,  the  observations 

associated with Fogelius were actually those of Heinrich Siverus. Fogelius explicitly stated in his 

original letter (MS RS EL/F1/34) on 1 November 1671 in the Julian calendar and on 11 November 

1671 in the Gregorian calendar; “Furthermore, the sunspot has revealed itself to us again but it is 

no  longer  visible.  I  send  you  the  observations  made  here  by  the  famous  Heinrich  Sivers  [NB 

Siverus] with a telescope of modest length” (Hall and Hall, 1971, pp. 330–335). His statement is 

confirmed  with  signatures  of  “H.  S.”  in  the  original  drawings  in  the  Royal  Society  archives  (see 

Figure 1). On their basis, the sunspot observations in Fogelius (1671) are not by Fogelius himself 

but by Siverus. 

Instead,  Fogelius  stated  his  own  observations  not  in  September  but  in  August  in  his  earlier  letter 

(RS  MS  RS  EL/F1/33)  dated  on  11  August  1671  in  the  Julian  calendar  (21  August  1671  in  the 

Gregorian calendar). He stated, “this week we observed a sunspot here, demonstrated by the same 

very  learned  Picard,  who  had  first  seen  it  in  the  center  of  the  sun’s  disk  at  sea,  with  a  three-foot 

telescope, on the third/thirteenth of this month while off the island of Texel; in the following days 

it progressed towards the western limb near which we saw it on both the 7/17 and 8/18, each day 

nearer to the limb. On the ninth it was still visible and on the tenth we did not observe the heavens, 

because it was pretty cloudy. Whether Sivers saw it I may tell you next time. When Picard saw it 

the first time it was much like the tail of a scorpion, with a separated bulges which afterwards were 

observed  to  come  together  more  closely.  On  the  ninth  it  was  like  a  melon  seed”  (Hall  and  Hall, 

1971,  pp.  198–201).  On  this  basis,  Fogelius’  observational  dates  are  identified  as  17–19  August 

1671, whereas the last one was overlooked in HS98.

Second,  the  general  descriptions  for  spotless  days  require  serious  caveats  for  its  usage  on 

quantitative  discussions  (e.g.,  Vaquero  et  al.,  2016;  Arlt  and  Vaquero,  2020).  Considering  the 

modern  weather  of  Hamburg,  it  is  slightly  unrealistic  to  expect  either  Fogelius  to  conduct 

observations  every  day  during  15  October  1660  –  31  July  1671  as  suggested  in  the  existing 

databases (e.g., HS98; V+16). A contemporary description in Philosophical Transactions makes us 

more cautious: “Whence it will appear, that some such Spots were seen here in London, A. 1660. 

And  Mons.  Picard  affirm’d  to  Dr.  Fogelius  at  Hamburg,  that  he  had  seen  some  in  October  1661, 

witness  the  said  Doctor’s  own  letter,  written  to  the  Publisher  August  11th  last”  (Anon.,  1671,  p. 

2250).  In  fact,  Fogelius  himself  explicitly  stated,  “Picard  himself  told  us  he  has  seen  none  [=  no 

sunspots] since 13 and 14 October 1661, and had heard of none observed during the last ten years” 

in his correspondence (RS MS EL/F1/33; Hall and Hall, 1671, pp. 198–201). Accordingly, it was 

not  Fogelius  but  Picard  who  saw  sunspots  on  13–14  October  1661  and  affirmed  a  general  zero 

statement by August 1671. Such descriptions do not provide clues for continuous spotless days for 

approximately  ten  years  within  Fogelius’s  own  observations.  Therefore,  we  need  to  remove 

Fogelius’s data from the datasets of datable sunspot observations.   

Fogelius’ correspondence further shows his description on the lunar eclipse on 8 September 1671, 

which confirms that dating in his letter was based on the Julian calendar, as the total eclipse took 

place on 8 September not in the Gregorian calendar but in the Julian calendar. Accordingly, Siverus’ 

observational dates should be converted to the Gregorian calendar. Moreover, another spotless day 

on 1 November 1671 (HS98; V+16) was not when Siverus or Fogelius conducted observations, but 

when Fogelius wrote his original letter (see Fogelius, 1671). Therefore, this spotless day should be 

removed.     

3. Heinrich Siverus’ Sunspot Group Number 

As  such,  the  original  observer  of  the  sunspot  drawing  in  Fogelius  (1671)  has  been  revealed  as 

Siverus, unlike what has been described in HS98. Archival investigations located his original letter 

in  MS  EL/F1/34  with  two  sunspot  drawings,  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  one  to  the  right  is  the 

original  version  of  Figure  III  of  Fogelius  (1671).  The  other  drawing  involves  three  more 

observations: active days on 18 and 19 August in the Gregorian calendar and a spotless-day report 

on 20 August in the Gregorian calendar. This modifies Wolf’s dating for his observations in early 

August in 1671.

Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, DOI: 10.1093/mnras/staa2965 

November 1671 (MS RS EL/F1/34; ©The Royal Society). 

On the other hand, existing databases (HS98; V+16) have registered significant amounts of spotless 

days  in  Siverus’  datasets  in  1675–1690  (HS98)  or  at  least  in  1678  and  1680–1681  (V+16). 

Consulting  the  Wolf  (1850a,  pp.  46–47),  the  main  source  document  for  Siverus’  observations  is 

identified with Ettmüller (1693). Here, Ettmüller (1693, p. 5) has clarified that Siverus conducted 

sunspot observations from 1675 to 1690. Among this period, Ettmüller has specifically recollected 

sunspot visibility on 4 and 6 August 1680, 14 May and 15 June 1681 (Ettmüller, 1693, p. 8), 27–29 

October 1689 (Ettmüller, 1693, p. 12), and 19–22 July 1689 (Ettmüller, 1693, p. 13). They are in 

Julian calendar and should be converted to Gregorian calendar (see Table 1). Their number has not 

been clarified that much, except for 27–29 October 1689, where the number of individual spots has 

developed from 3 to 6. Nevertheless, we can only derive visibility of sunspot groups on these dates 

and cannot be sure on its exact group. Therefore, we record their group number ≥ 1, whereas those 

in 1689 had been removed in V+16. 

On the other hand, neither Ettmüller (1693) nor Wolf (1850a, pp. 46–47) has documented spotless 

days with exact dates. In fact, HS98 has stated, “The original observations by Siverus are now lost 

so  we  do  not  know  on  what  days  he  was  observing.  Spoerer  (1889)  [NB  Spörer  (1889)]  says  his 

manuscript  in  Hamburg  could  no  longer  be  found”.  Therefore,  Siverus’  existing  spotless  days 

registered  in  the  existing  databases  are  without  robust  evidence  and  should  be  removed,  unless 

otherwise his original logbooks are found in future.   

Figure  2:  (a)  Sunspot  drawings  on  “25–26  February  1678”  depicted  in  Ettmüller  (1693);  (b) 

Willoughby’s  drawing  for  a  spotless  Sun  on  22  June  1666  in  Julian  calendar,  namely  on  2  July 

1666 (MS RS CLP 8i/13a; ©The Royal Society). 

Apart  from  these  records,  Wolf  mentioned,  “From  25  and  26  February  1678,  a  large  spot  is 

depicted” in Ettmüller’s dissertation (Wolf, 1850a, p. 46). This is probably derived from drawings 

in Ettmüller’s dissertation (Figure 2a), which has been likely interpreted as Siverus’ observations 

and  incorporated  in  HS98  and  V+16  after  conversion  to  the  Gregorian  calendar  (7  and  8  March 

1678),  while  neither  Ettmüller  (1693)  nor  Wolf  (1850a)  has  explicitly  associated  these  drawings 

with Siverus. Therefore, we have removed them from Siverus’ observations. 

On  their  basis,  datable  sunspot  observations  in  Fogelius’  and  Siverus’  records  have  been 

summarized in Table 1, in comparison with his contemporaries’ observations. As shown in Table 1,

the apparent spotless days have been eliminated, as they were actually spotless days. Despite this 

drastic  revision,  Siverus’  sunspot  drawings  provide  valuable  snapshots  in  the  depth  of  the  MM, 

showing  only  one  group  at  best.  The  spotless  days  between  1662  and  1670  were  actually 

misinterpretations  of  hearsays  from  Picard’s  observations.  Still,  Willoughby’s  report  during  the 

partial  eclipse  shows  a  spotless  Sun  on  2  July  1666  (MS  RS  CLP  8i/13a;  see  Figure  2b)  and 

indicates  a  low  solar  activity  in  this  interval.  On  the  other  hand,  the  only  positive  report  in  this 

interval,  namely  that  of  Atanasius  Kircher  on  2  September  1667  in  V+16  is  not  an  observational 

date but a date of his letter (Frick, 1681, p. 49; Usoskin et al., 2015). Therefore, this record must be 

removed from the discussions on the sunspot group number, whereas this has been reserved in the 

revision  of  V+16  despite  the  clarification  in  Usoskin  et  al.  (2015).  Accordingly,  the  revised  data 

show that the existing databases (e.g., V+16) slightly underestimated the solar-cycle amplitude of 

the  MM  with  these  ghost  spotless  days,  but  that  the  solar  activity  in  the  MM  is  still  much  more 

suppressed  than  that  of  the  modern  solar  cycles  or  the  Dalton  Minimum  (see  also  Usoskin  et  al., 

2015; Vaquero et al., 2015; Muñoz-Jaramillo and Vaquero, 2019; Hayakawa et al., 2020a)

Table  1:  Fogelius’  and  Siverus’  datable  sunspot  observations  and  those  mentioned  in  Fogelius’ 

correspondences and his contemporaries (Picard and Hook). Their original observers are corrected 

to  Picard,  Siverus,  and  Fogelius  himself.  Picard’s  observations  on  3–4  August  1671  have  been 

revised  to  3  August  1671.  We  have  also  shown  the  revised  version  of  Hook’s  sunspot  group 

number for comparison.   

4. Sunspot Positions and Comparisons with his Contemporary Observations 

Obtaining  corrected  dates  in  the  Gregorian  calendar,  sequences  of  Siverus’  sunspot  drawings  in 

1671  allow  us  to  track  motions  and  evolutions  of  this  group,  in  combination  with  Cassini’s 

oft-cited  sunspot  drawings  in  August  1671  (see  Figure  2  from  Cassini  (1671a,  1671b);  see  also 

Usoskin  et  al.  (2015)).  Cassini  made  his  observations  at  the  Paris  Observatory  following  the 

Gregorian calendar (e.g., Ribes and Nesme-Ribes, 1993). Comparing Siverus’ drawings (Figure 1) 

with  Cassini’s  drawings,  we  infer  that  Siverus  and  Cassini  probably  reported  the  same  sunspot

group.  Cassini  had  noticed  this  sunspot  group  earlier  on  11  August  (Figure  3a,  II)  and  kept 

watching it until 19 August, when it almost arrived at the western limb (Figure 3b, VIII). Siverus 

monitored this sunspot group during the last two days: on 18–19 August (Figure 1a).   

The  August  sunspot  is  probably  identified  with  what  Picard  observed  too  (see  Ribes  and 

Nesme-Ribes,  1993).  Cassini  (1671a)  cited  Picard’s  observations  as  follows:  “Mr.  Picard  had 

observ’d  at  Sea  a  Spot  in  the  Sun  from  the  third  of  August  (ft.  n.)  to  the  nineteenth  of  the  same 

inclusively;  and  seen  it,  at  the  first,  like  the  Tayl  of  a  Scorpion;  but  on  the  nineteenth  day 

resembling  a  Melon-seed”  (translated  in  Cassini  (1671c,  p.  2253)).  Picard’s  extremely  early 

witness  on  3  August  1671  is  actually  a  misinterpretation  of  the  “thirteenth”,  as  confirmed  in 

Fogelius’  letter  (MS  RS  EL/F1/34;  Hall  and  Hall,  1971,  pp.  198–201)  and  his  correspondence  to 

Hevelius and Fogelius (Picolet, 1978, pp. 8 and 19). As such, his observations on 3–4 August 1671 

should be removed from discussions of sunspot group number (c.f., HS98; V+16). His description 

of its morphological transition from a scorpion tail to a melon seed looks consistent with Cassini’s 

drawings (see Figure 3a (V) and 3b (VIII)).   

Likewise, HS98 listed Stetini as reporting a sunspot group on 8–18 August 1671, citing Hevelius’s 

Machina Coelestis. However, Hevelius himself stated “Macula ¤ notabilis conspecta Hamburgi a 

Cl.  Picardo  die  13.  Stetini  vero  a  die  8  as  18,  quam  etiam  Lipsiae  videreunt”  which  reads  “A 

notable sunspot was seen at Hamburg by Cl. Picard on 13. In Stettin from 8 to 18, equally also seen 

in Leipzig” (Hevelius, 1679, p. 21). As such, “Stetini” is not a certain astronomer’s name but just a 

name of the German city “Stettin”.

satisfied with Hook’s observations in London, who “saw a large Spot in the Center of the Suns face 

about  noon”  on  30  August  and  the  same  group  moving  westward  on  1  September  in  the  Julian 

calendar (Hook, 1671, p. 2295), which should be corrected to 9 and 11 September in the Gregorian 

calendar with the drawing. Given their consistent central locations on 9 and 11 September, Hook 

probably  saw  what  Siverus  saw  in  September  (see  Figure  1b).  This  does  not  mean  we  should 

automatically  convert  all  of  Hook’s  observational  dates  in  the  existing  databases  (HS98;  V+16). 

Three  days  of  Robert  Hook’s  observations  are  known  in  1676  (25  June  and  8  and  17  August). 

According  to  his  original  records,  Robert  Hook  saw  “a  very  conspicuous  macula  with  its 

immediately incompassing Nubecula, and some other less conspicuous Spots at a further distance 

pass  over  the  Disk  of  the  Sun”  in  June  1676  without  exact  dates.  He  saw  sunspots  again  “at  the 

latter  end  of  July  and  the  beginning  of  August”.  On  29  July  1676  [NB  8  August  1676  in  the 

Gregorian calendar], he saw “about six greater and smaller in one knot with their proper Nubecules 

or  Umbra’s”  and  lost  this  spot  after  4  August  [NB  14  August]  and  did  not  find  any  spots  on  7 

August [NB 17 August in the Gregorian calendar] (Hook, 1677, p. 52). Accordingly, we revise one 

record on 8 August 1676, remove one record on 25 June 1676, and add one record on 14 August 

1676 in the existing datasets for Hook. 

Relationships  of  these  sunspot  groups  in  mid-1671  are  better  assessed  with  the  motion  of  these 

sunspot groups and comparison of their latitudes, as both Cassini (Figure 3a) and Siverus (Figures 

1a and 1b) describe the motion of the sunspot groups in sequences. However, we need to be careful 

with  their  variable  orientations.  Siverus  set  his  diagram  orientation  as  east  (Or.)  at  its  left,  west 

(Occ.) at its right, and north (Sept.) at its top, as clarified in his printed diagram (Fogelius, 1671, 

Figure III). However, Cassini set his diagram orientation as east (Or.) at its right, west (Occ.) at its 

left,  south  (Mer.)  at  its  top,  and  north  (Sept.)  at  its  bottom,  as  shown  in  Figure  3a.  The  depicted 

directions  indicate  that  Siverus’  sunspot  drawings  are  shown  in  erect  images  and  Cassini’s  are 

shown  in  inverted  images.  Given  these  observations  were  performed  in  1671,  Siverus  probably 

used  a  Schyrle-style  refractor  telescope  with  aerial  imaging  through  filtering  glass  to  show  such 

erect images, whereas Cassini probably used a Kepler-style refractor telescope with aerial imaging 

through  filtering  glass  to  show  such  inverted  images  (see  e.g.,  Court  and  von  Rohr,  1929;  Rudd, 

2007).   

Following  their  date  in  the  Gregorian  calendar,  we  have  tracked  their  motions.  Both  Siverus  and 

Cassini  have  probably  corrected  the  orientations  of  the  solar  disks  for  this  comparison  and  show 

their  North-South  directions  in  the  celestial  coordinates  rather  than  directions  in  the  heliographic 

coordinates.  On  this  basis,  the  solar  rotational  axis  is  found  from  the  North-South  direction  on  a

drawing  with  a  position  angle  (P-angle)  correction.  Using  the  corrected  dates,  the  heliographic 

latitude  of  the  centre  of  the  visible  solar  disk  (B0  angle)  is  computed  as  approximately  7°14′  for 

both  the  August  (Figure  1a)  and  September  drawings  (Figure  1b).  Taking  these  variables  into 

account, we have computed the positions of depicted sunspots in Siverus’ sunspot drawings (Figure 

1) and Cassini’s sunspot drawing (Figure 3a).

blue  circles  and  Cassini’s  August  drawing  (Figure  3)  in  green  diamonds  above;  their  comparison 

with those in Ribes and Nesme-Ribes (1993) digitised in Vaquero et al. (2015b). 

Figure  5  summarises  these  sunspot  positions  in  our  estimates.  Our  calculations  show  the  sunspot 

moving  in  the  latitude  of  ≈  N7.5°  ±  2.5°  in  Siverus’  August  drawing  and  September  drawing 

(Figure  1),  except  for  the  last  three  days  (13–15  September),  when  the  latitude  of  the  sunspot 

monotonically  increased.  This anomalous excursion is  probably  caused  due  to  its  approach  to  the 

western solar limb. Therefore, we carefully recalculate positions of sunspots on September 13 – 15 

to ensure that they are in latitudinal range above. Likewise, our calculations show Cassini’s sunspot 

moving in the latitude of ≈  N10° ± 1° on 11–13 August. With similar latitudes, they were located 

near the disk centre on 13 August (see Figure 3) and 9 September (see Figure 1 and Table 1). Their 

27-day separation agrees well with the duration of the solar rotation (e.g., Willis and Davis, 2015; 

Hayakawa et al., 2019). Therefore, their close latitudinal agreements and chronological separation 

for  one  solar  rotation  confirm  that  Siverus  and  Cassini  probably  depicted  the  same  active  region 

(AR)  in  the  low  latitude  of  the  northern  solar  hemisphere  and  its  recurrence  in  August  and 

September to confirm speculations of Cassini and Hook. 

6. Summary and Discussions 

In  this  contribution,  we  have  analysed  the  sunspot  records,  which  have  been  associated  with 

Fogelius in previous studies (HS98; V+16), in comparison with Fogelius’ original correspondences 

(MS RS EL/F1/33 and MS RS EL/F1/34; Figure 1) and his contemporaries’ observations such as 

those of Cassini and Hook (Figure 4). Our analyses have shown that the sunspot plate in Fogelius 

(1671) actually shows Heinrich Siverus’ observations and have located original drawings including 

one omitted in Fogelius (1671). 

Based  on  Fogelius’  correspondences,  we  have  shown  that  his  and  Siverus’  records  were  dated  in 

the  Julian  calendar  and  we  have  corrected  the  dates  to  the  Gregorian  calendar.  Moreover,  his 

sunspot observations on 13–14 October 1661 and few statements in the existing databases were not 

his  own  observations  but  actually  hearsay  from  Picard.  Fogelius’  own  observations  are  found  on 

17–19 August 1671. Siverus conducted his sunspot observations at least between 1675 and 1690, 

and a few of them have been cited in Ettmüller (1693) without explicit clarifications of exact dates 

of  spotless  days.  We  have  revised  Siverus’  observations  on  their  basis  and  removed  apparent 

spotless days without robust evidence. These observations are so far the only known datable ones 

by  Fogelius  and  Siverus,  unless  their  original  logbooks  or  separate  publications  are  located. 

Therefore, the ghost spotless days in Fogelius’ and Siverus’ observations in the existing databases 

13

have probably underestimated the solar-cycle amplitude during the core MM.   

In fact, their preserved data were not “long-term” observations but snapshots for the solar activity 

during the MM. Still, while these revisions removed considerable spotless days, they show at best 1 

or 2 groups in this interval and do not contradict the absence of the positive days between 1662 and 

1670.  This  is  almost  consistent  with  their  contemporaries’  observations  such  as  those  of  Hook’s 

and Willoughby’s. Especially, between 1662 and 1670, Willoughby’s recorded a spotless Sun on 2 

July 1666 (MS RS CLP 8i/13a; see Figure 2b) and the only positive day in V+16, namely that of 

Atanasius  Kircher  on  2  September  1667  was  not  derived  from  his  actual  observation  (see  also 

Usoskin  et  al.,  2015;  c.f.,  Vaquero  et  al.,  2016).  These  results  have  been  summarised  in  Table  1 

and indicate significantly low solar activity in this interval. As such, our result supports the current 

paradigm  for  the  MM  as  a  grand  minimum  (Usoskin  et  al.,  2015;  Vaquero  et  al.,  2015)  and 

disagrees with the claimed enhanced solar activity during the MM (Zolotova and Ponyavin, 2015).   

Based  on  the  revised  data  (see  Table  1),  we  have  compared  their  observations  with  Cassini’s 

drawings in 1671, clarifying their orientations as erect images for Siverus’ and inverted images for 

Cassini’s.  On  this  basis,  we  have  computed  their  positions  as  approximately  N7.5°  ±  2.5°  in 

Siverus’  and  approximately  N10°  ±  1°  in  Cassini’s  (Figure  5).  Their  latitudinal  agreement  and 

27-day  separation  of  the  central  meridian  passages  allow  us  to  identify  these  sunspot  groups 

probably as the same recurrent AR. Picard and observers at Stettin and Leipzig probably saw this 

AR too. We have revised Picard’s observation date to 13 August and corrected Stetini and Leipzig 

in  HS98  as  observers  at  Stettin  and  Leipzig,  both  witnessing  this  sunspot  on  8–18  August.  This 

implies the AR had a notably long lifespan of ≥ 35 days even during the MM or at least an active 

longitude  during  the  MM.  For  the  former,  recurrent  ARs  are  more  typical  with  larger  ARs 

(Petrovay and van Driel-Gesztelyi, 1997; Henwood et al., 2010; Namekata et al., 2019) and hence 

those  under  higher  solar  activity  (Hathaway  et  al.,  2002;  Figures  7  and  8  of  Hathaway,  2015). 

Otherwise, this could indicate an active longitude during the MM. Further case studies are needed 

to exploit behaviours of the recurrent ARs during the MM.
