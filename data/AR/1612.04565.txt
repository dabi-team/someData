Abstract. Photoionized nebulae comprise basically HII regions and plan-
etary nebulae, and their abundances give important clues on the nucle-
osynthesis and chemical evolution of their host galaxies. There is presently
a large amount of data on these objects, especially for the elements He
and N, which are strongly aﬀected by the evolution of intermediate mass
stars, as well as O, Ne, S, and Ar, which are essentially synthesized in stars
with larger masses. The abundances of these elements in several systems
in the Local Group are discussed on the basis of distance-independent
correlations.

1.

Introduction

Planetary nebulae (PN) provide accurate abundances of elements that are not
signiﬁcantly produced by their progenitor stars such as O, Ne, S, and Ar, as
well as some elements for which the abundances have been changed, such as
He, N, and C. The former can be used to study the chemical evolution of the
host galaxies, and the latter can place constraints on the nucleosynthesis of
intermediate mass stars. Distance-independent correlations involving O, Ne,
S, and Ar can then be compared with the corresponding abundances of young
objects, such as HII regions, Blue Compact Galaxies (BCG) and Emission Line
Galaxies (ELG). In this paper we intend (i) to compare the abundances of HII
regions and PN in diﬀerent galaxies of the Local Group in order to investigate
the diﬀerences derived from the age and origin of these objects, (ii) compare
the chemical evolution in these systems, and (iii) investigate to what extent
the nucleosynthesis contributions from the progenitor stars aﬀect the observed
abundances in planetary nebulae. Section 2 describes the data used in this
investigation, and Section 3 presents our results and discussion. Further details
can be found in Maciel et al. (2017).

2. The Data

We have considered abundance data for PN and HII regions in the following
objects: The Milky Way (MW), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Small

Magellanic Cloud (SMC), M31, M32, M33, M51, M81, M101, NGC 185, NGC
205, NGC 300, NGC 628, NGC 3109, NGC 5194, and the Sextans galaxy. The
uncertainties are typically of 0.2 to 0.3 dex for PN and 0.1 to 0.2 dex for HII
regions. The PN sample includes over 1300 objects, while the HII region sample
has over 900 objects, as shown in Table 1. We have preferably used the PN data
obtained by our own group, but have also considered some recent abundance
determinations from the literature, particularly from sources using a similar pro-
cedure as our group. For HII regions we have preferably adopted abundances
obtained from detailed electron temperatures, instead of the strong line method.
Blue Compact Galaxies and Emission Line Galaxies have also been included, as
they are essentially low metallicity HII regions. The samples are large enough
to compensate for the inhomogeneity of data, as a large number of sources has
to be considered, since there is no complete homogeneous sample available. The
complete list of sources for each object is given by Maciel et al. (2017).

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. O, Ne, S, and Ar

Figure 1 shows histograms of the oxygen abundance O/H for planetary nebulae
and HII regions in two representative cases: The Milky Way (left panels) and all
objects considered here, namely the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds and the
remaining external galaxies (right panels). Both PN and HII regions have similar
distributions, although the HII region distributions are generally broader than
in the case of planetary nebulae. Also, it can be noticed that a larger fraction of
HII regions have log (O/H) + 12 ≥ 9, which reﬂects the fact that these younger
objects are formed by more enriched material. Similar plots can be obtained for
Ne, S, and Ar.

Distance-independent correlations for Ne are shown in Figure 2. The left panels
refer to the Milky Way, while the right panels are for all objects considered. The
top ﬁgures show the abundances relative to hydrogen (Ne/H), while the bottom
ﬁgures show the abundances relative to oxygen (Ne/O). The squares represent
Milky Way PN, the circles are external PN, the triangles represent HII regions
in the Milky Way, and the crosses are external HII regions. We see that for
the Ne/H ratio both PN and HII regions present a lockstep variation with O/H,
although for HII regions the dispersion is much smaller. This is also reﬂected in

the bottom ﬁgure, indicating that the Ne/O ratio is essentially constant with a
higher dispersion for PN. The estimated dispersions are about 0.2 dex for PN
and 0.1 dex for HII regions.
The same behaviour observed in the Galaxy also holds in other Local Group
objects. Despite their diﬀerent metallicities and morphologies, their nucleosyn-
thetic processes and chemical evolution are apparently very similar. The trend
displayed in Figure 2 (right) shows a very good agreement with the trend found
by Izotov et al. 2006 on the basis of ELG only. Similar conclusions were obtained
by Richer and McCall 2007, 2008. For the right panel, the fractions of objects
within 1σ and 2σ are 0.78 and 0.93, respectively.
It is interesting to notice that in this larger sample the observed ranges of oxygen
and neon abundances in PN and HII regions are similar. The similarity essen-
tially reﬂects the fact that the interstellar metallicities did not change appreciably
in the last 5 Gyr approximately, a result that is supported by determinations of
the age-metallicity in the Milky Way (see for example Rocha-Pinto et al. 2000,
Bensby et al. 2004.
The results shown in Figure 2 can be interpreted assuming that the dispersion
in the PN data reﬂects the fact that the abundances are not as well determined
as in the HII regions. However, a larger dispersion would be expected, since PN
are older objects than the HII regions and any given sample probably includes
objects of diﬀerent ages, as we have shown elsewhere (Maciel et al. 2010, 2011).
It can also be considered that there is some contribution to the Ne abundances
from the PN progenitor stars, as suggested in some investigations (see for example
Peña et al. 2007). It has been argued that the third dredge-up process in AGB

stars may aﬀect the oxygen abundances observed in PN (see for example Karakas
& Lattanzio 2014). ON cycling would also reduce the O/H ratio especially in
lower metallicity PN with massive progenitor stars (see for example Karakas &
Lattanzio 2007). Our results show that, if present, such contribution should be
small compared with the average uncertainties in the PN abundances, so that an
average contribution of about 0.1 dex cannot be ruled out. On the other hand,
if we compare the expected contributions both to oxygen and neon, it is unlikely
that their are equal, which is needed in order to explain the similarity of the PN
and HII region trends shown in Figures 2 (cf. Karakas and Lattanzio 2003).

In the case of sulphur, as shown in Figure 3, the general trends with oxygen are
similar to neon, but some diﬀerences arise. The average dispersions are now 0.3
dex for PN and 0.2 dex for HII regions. For the Milky Way, the HII regions
present a very good correlation, and the data extend to higher and lower metal-
licities compared with neon. The galactic PN already display what is usually
called the “sulphur anomaly”, that is, many PN apparently have somewhat lower
S/H abundances than expected for their metallicity (see the detailed discussions
by Henry et al. 2004, 2012). The sulphur anomaly has been attributed to a
deﬁciency in the sulphur ICFs, particularly due to the abundance of the S+3 ion,
lack of accurate atomic constants, eﬀect of the nucleosynthesis in the progenitor
stars, and diﬀerent chemical evolution of the systems considered.
Considering the right panel of Figure 3, it can be seen that there is still a reason-
able number of objects below the HII region curve, but there is a large number of
PN in the opposite side, so that the sulphur anomaly is not particularly notice-

able. The inclusion of BCG and ELG maintains these conclusions, that is, the
sulphur abundances of HII regions apparently do not show the sulphur anomaly,
which is then a characteristic of the empirical determination of sulphur abun-
dances in PN.

For argon the observed correlations are similar compared to neon, but the dis-
persion is higher and is comparable to S/H, as can be seen from Figure 4. The
comparison with HII regions suﬀers from the lack of data for this element, espe-
cially for the Milky Way. The inclusion of BCG and ELG clearly improves the
correlation, showing that the correlation deﬁned at higher metallicities for the
Milky Way still holds for lower and intermediate oxygen abundances. For PN,
the Ar/H dispersion is higher compared with Ne/H, but for HII regions the dis-
persions in Ne/H, S/H, and Ar/H for the whole sample are similar to each other,
and always smaller than the PN data. Therefore, the HII regions are clearly
more homogeneous than the PN, which reﬂects their very low ages, roughly a
few million years.

3.2. Elements produced by the PN progenitor stars

Histograms of the N/H abundances for PN and HII regions in our sample are
shown in Figure 5, which can be directly compared with Figure 1. The PN
distribution is similar in the two cases shown, while for HII regions the inclusion
of external galaxies (as well as BCG and ELG) shifts the maximum downwards by
about 0.5 dex. The main diﬀerence between O/H and N/H is that the nitrogen

abundances extends to lower metallicities for HII regions compared with PN,
which reﬂects the N production during the evolution of the PN progenitor stars.

Helium abundances in HII regions are frequently aﬀected by the presence of
neutral helium, so that in this work we have adopted a lower limit of He/H =
0.03 in order to avoid objects with an important fraction of neutral He.
Figure 6 shows the N/H and N/O ratios as functions of O/H and He/H, respec-
tively, for the case where all objects are considered. The most striking result is
that, as expected, PN show an increase in both N and He compared to most HII
regions in the sample. The average dispersions of the nitrogen data are higher,
about 0.4 dex for PN and 0.3 dex for HII regions. Therefore, a larger disper-
sion is also observed for HII regions, so that part of their nitrogen is probably
secondary.
Our results clearly reﬂect the fact that the nitrogen abundances measured in
PN include both the pristine nitrogen plus the contribution from the dredge
up processes that aﬀect the red giant progenitor stars. Similar trends have also
been recently discussed by García-Hernández et al. 2016. Adopting a pregalactic
Izotov et al. 2014), which
He abundance by mass of about Y = 0.255 (cf.
corresponds to approximately He/H = 0.09, we conclude from Figure 6 (bottom)
that about 80% of the PN with He excess have abundances up to He/H ≃ 0.141,
which is about 57% higher than the pregalactic value. This can be compared
with an amount of 50% derived by Richer & McCall 2008 from a smaller sample.
More recently, Lattanzio & Karakas 2016 suggested an increase of about 38% in
the helium content by mass from the second dredge-up process in AGB stars,

which would lead to an increase of about 60% in the He abundance by number
of atoms, in excellent agreement with the results shown in Figure 6.
Also from Figure 6 we can have an idea of the amount of nitrogen produced by the
progenitor stars. Adopting as limit for primary nitrogen the amount produced
by type II supernovae (Izotov et al. 2006), corresponding to approximately
log N/O = −1.6, and considering the expected secondary nitrogen enrichment,
which corresponds to about log N/O = −1.2, Figure 6 (bottom) implies that
about 80% of the PN present an enrichment ratio up to factor of 13.3, comparable
with the factor of 10 found by Richer & McCall (2016).
In Figure 6 (bottom) we include a comparison with some recent theoretical mod-
els by Karakas 2010 with Z = 0.02, 0.004, and 0.008, while the dashed lines
represent models by Marigo et al. 2003 with Z = 0.019. According to these
models, progenitors having 0.9 to 4 M⊙ and solar composition can explain the
“normal” abundances, He/H < 0.15, while for objects with higher enhancements
(He/H > 0.15), masses of 4 to 5 M⊙ are needed, plus an eﬃcient HBB. Recent
models by Pignatari et al. 2016 with Z = 0.01 and 0.02 are also consistent
with these results, as can be seen in the discussion by Delgado-Inglada et al.
2015. For intermediate mass stars, agreement with theoretical models is fair,
but abundance determinations should be improved and expanded.
