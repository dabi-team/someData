Abstract

Here, we analyzed magnetic elements of the solar active regions (ARs) observed in the line-of-sight
magnetograms (the 6173 Å Fe I line) recorded with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI). The Yet Another Feature Tracking Algorithm (YAFTA) was employed to
extract the statistical properties of these features (e.g. ﬁlling factor, magnetic ﬂux, and lifetime) within
180′′ inside the ﬂaring AR (NOAA 12443) and the non-ﬂaring AR (NOAA 12446)
the areas of 180′′ ×
for 3 to 5 November 2015 and for 4 to 6 November 2015, respectively. The mean ﬁlling factor of polarities
was obtained to be about 0.49 for the ﬂaring AR; this value was 0.08 for the non-ﬂaring AR. Time series
of the ﬁlling factors of the negative and positive polarities for the ﬂaring AR showed anti-correlation
(with the Pearson value of -0.80); while for the non-ﬂaring AR, there was the strong positive correlation
(with the Pearson value of 0.95). A power-law function was ﬁtted to the frequency distributions of ﬂux
(F), size (S), and lifetime (T). Power exponents of the distributions of ﬂux, size, and lifetime for the
ﬂaring AR were obtained to be about -2.36, -3.11, and -1.70, respectively; these values of exponents for
the non-ﬂaring AR were found to be about -2.53, -3.42, and -1.61, respectively. The code detected a
1020 Mx, and the maximum value of the size was
magnetic element with the maximum ﬂux of 23.54

found to be about 300 Mm2. The most long-lived patch in the ﬂaring AR was belonged to an element
with the lifetime of 2208 minutes. It was revealed that S, T, and F for patches in the ﬂaring AR follow
empirical scaling relations as S ∝ F0.66, S ∝ T0.32, and F ∝ T0.48, respectively; For appeared patches in
the non-ﬂaring AR, these relations were obtained as S ∝ F0.64, S ∝ T0.23 and F ∝ T0.37, respectively.
The comparisons indicated that values of correlations between parameters of F and T, and also, S and T
for the ﬂaring AR, are more than those of the non-ﬂaring AR, and the quite-Sun (QS). The scaling law
relation between the ﬂux growth rate of positive polarities and their size revealed a strong correlation of
more than 0.7 in both ARs. Sun: ﬂares — Sun: photosphere — Sun: magnetic ﬁelds — methods: data

Introduction

The solar surface is ubiquitously covered by the magnetic elements in which their ﬂux and size
distributions follow scale-free behavior (e.g., Parnell et al. 2009, Javaherian et al. 2017). The mag-

netic elements emerged in pairs with opposite polarities (Lorrain et al. 2006, de Wijn et al. 2009).
Both of the positive and negative polarities with smallest sizes, known as "patches", are observ-
able in the line-of-sight magnetograms. These magnetic ﬁeld concentrations are often consistent
with appearing bright points in G band and CaII H lines (Otsuji et al. 2007, de Wijn et al. 2009). The size
and ﬂux of magnetic patches are ranged from 1014 to 1016 cm2 and 1017 to 1019 Mx, respectively (e.g., Stenﬂo
1973, Hagenaar et al. 2003, Priest 2014). The patches’ size increases with increasing latitude, and many of
patches tend to have appeared as isolated ones in the polar region with high order of magnetic strength
about one kG (de Wijn et al. 2009). To understand the underlying process of magnetic elements, many statis-
tical works were done. The power-law behavior of the ﬂux distribution of magnetic features were discussed
in Parnell et al. (2009). Also, the statistical analyzes of the polarities demonstrated that the magnetic ﬂux
growth rate is the power-law function of the magnetic ﬂux (Otsuji et al. 2011). By tracking a number of
magnetic features in the QS and focusing on their birth (death), it was revealed that for determining the
lifetimes of magnetic features, the shredding and dispersal of ﬂux is more dominant processes than the
other known processes. The relationships between the network and internetwork solar magnetic ﬂux were
studied by Goši´c et al. (2014). They showed that 14% of ﬂux originates from internetwork magnetic ﬁelds.
The analyzes of photospheric plasma motions and polar magnetic patches indicated that magnetic patches’
decay is inﬂuenced by cancelation and unipolar disappearance with or without fragmentation (Kaithakkal
et al. 2015). It was found that the rates of appearance and disappearance of magnetic ﬂux in internetwork

tics and physical properties of photospheric magnetic elements to ﬁnd their inﬂuences on the QS corona
(Close et al. 2005), network and internetwork areas (Schrijver & Title 2003, de Wijn et al. 2005, Narang
et al. 2019, Buehler et al. 2019), and also, the other solar features such as faculae (Okunev & Kneer 2004,
Kaithakkal et al. 2013), coronal mass ejections (CMEs), mini CMEs (Honarbakhsh et al. 2016), and ﬁlaments
(Louis 2019, Liu et al. 2019b). Investigating the relation between solar ﬂares as an energetic large-scale and
inﬂuential phenomena and photospheric magnetic elements as much as predicting solar ﬂares using surface
AR patches has been subject of many recent studies (e.g., Conlon et al. 2010, Gosain 2012, Wang et al. 2012,
Burtseva & Petrie 2013, Jiang et al. 2017, Teh 2019, Liu et al. 2019a).

Since the evolution of the atmosphere of the Sun is related to the magnetic ﬁelds, different high-spatial
and -temporal resolution space telescopes such as Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI: Scherrer et al. 1995), and
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Schou et al. 2012) were established to provide solar photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld magnitudes as magnetogram images. To process the large amount of data in a optimum way,
the automatic detection codes are needed. Curvature is the name of an algorithm that ﬁnds aggregations
of pixels with the same polarities which form convex cores around the local extrema. The updated version
of this code was represented by Hagenaar et al. (1999). Parnell (2002) developed a detection algorithm to
group pixels with absolute ﬂux values higher than a given threshold, called clumping algorithm. In the other
applicable method, named downhill, after ﬁnding pixels’ ﬂuxes with absolute values above lower cuttoff, the
structure’s peaks are determined, and magnetic features are identiﬁed as single ones per local maxima
(Welsch & Longcope 2003). It seems that the downhill and clumping techniques have better segmentation
results than the curvature algorithm (DeForest et al. 2007). For identifying the magnetic patches in internet-
work areas, de Wijn et al. (2005) developed a method which works based on convolving an image with a
suitable kernel, processing a resultant binary image with spatial and temporal erosion-dilation procedure,
and visually inspecting the internetwork bright points candidates after creating mask, temporal averaging
in a sequence of magnetograms, smoothing, and intensity thresholding. The other method for the segmen-
tation photospheric magnetic structures was developed by Kestener et al. (2010) which works based on 2-D
wavelet transform. Otsuji et al. (2011) employed the local correlation tracking method to track magnetic
elements and determine their morphological evaluation. One of the recent techniques that can track the ﬂux
of magnetic features from magnetograms and determines both emergence and cancellation of the magnetic
structures is the magnetic ball-tracking algorithm (Attie & Innes 2015). Zender et al. (2017) introduced a seg-
mentation method by thresholding on jointing adjacent pixels in a magnetogram. Pérez-Suárez et al. (2011)
gave a comprehensive review of the automatic detection of solar magnetic features and applications in the
space weather. Javaherian et al. (2017) focused on the magnetic features’ statistics in the quiet-Sun (QS) over
three days. Applying the Yet Another Feature Tracking Algorithm (YAFTA) on the magnetograms, it was

found that size, ﬂux, and lifetime distributions of the QS’s magnetic features follow the power-law function.
By investigating photospheric magnetic elements during the year 2011, they found that the ﬂux and size are
strongly correlated. Moreover, the statistical analysis shows that the magnetic features form a self-organized
criticality (SOC) system. One may ask whether or not there is any relationship between the magnetic patches
in the ARs and the QS. Here, we aim to investigate the features’ statistical properties (e.g. ﬁlling factor, size,
ﬂux, and lifetime) inside the ﬂaring AR and the non-ﬂaring AR. The YAFTA downhill algorithm (DeForest
et al. 2007) was employed to segregate the magnetic features from the consecutive HMI images. Next, to
differentiate scaling laws in the ARs, and also, to compare ﬁndings with the results extracted from the QS
(Javaherian et al. 2017), we focused on the relationships between the physical parameters of the patches.
Extracting scaling laws of physical parameters as appeared in the treatment of different phenomena that
follow nonlinear process may provide a physical model and an appropriate explanation about the future
behavior of the phenomena (e.g., see Aschwanden et al. 2008).

The layout is organized in the following steps: we introduce datasets in Section 2. The results are

discussed in Section 3. Concluding remarks are given in Section 4.

II. Data Analysis

Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Schou et al. 2012) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
provides full-solar-disk images with spatial and temporal resolutions of about 0.5 arcsec and 45 s, respec-
tively. For our purposes, the magnetogram images with a time lag of 45 s taken at 6173 Å were employed,
which recorded from 2 to 6 November 2015. Using the solar software package in Interactive Data Language
(IDL) programming, all images were derotated to the reference one when the regions of interest appeared
near the solar disk center. We focused on the ﬂaring AR (NOAA 12443), including C- and M-ﬂares (see
Table 1) and the non-ﬂaring AR (NOAA 12446) for three days. We chose square boxes, including the ﬂar-
ing AR (Figure 1, red contour) for days 3 to 5 November 2015, and the non-ﬂaring AR (Figure 1, green
contour) for days 4 to 6 November 2015 in the sequence of images. We selected areas within the ARs from
solar equatorial regions near the solar disk center (i.e., a region surrounded by longitudes
17◦ around the
180′′ to neglect
central meridian, and latitudes limited in
the projection effects (e.g., Alipour & Safari 2015). In Table 1, the characteristics of the ﬂaring AR and the
latest position of AR in both heliographic and heliocentric coordinates were speciﬁed (the latest positions
of the recorded ARs are valid on 21:35 UT of each day). Then, both constructed data cubes were prepared
to be fed to the YAFTA downhill algorithm for segregating magnetic features. The label of features is tracked
with the YAFTA match features algorithm. The two boxes with the size of 180′′ ×
180′′ were selected from the
sequence of derotated HMI images including the ﬂaring AR (Fgiure 1, red box) taken on 3 to 5 November
2015 and the non-ﬂaring AR (Fgiure 1, green box) taken on 4 to 6 November 2015.

III. Results and Discussions

The YAFTA code was applied on both constructed data cubes (see Section 2), including three days of data
with 5760 sequences. During the sequence of frames in the ﬂaring AR, the code identiﬁed 347502 magnetic
elements which 250337 of all detected patches survived more than one step (longer than one minute). For
the non-ﬂaring AR, among 114063 identiﬁed magnetic elements, 70790 of these detected patches survived
more than one step. Following the values selected by Parnell et al. (2009) and Javaherian et al. (2017), the
1.8 arcsec2 and 25 Gauss,
minimum thresholds of the patches area and magnetic ﬁeld were chosen to be 1.8
respectively.

i. Time series of area ﬁlling factor, number, and ﬂux of polarities

To compute the ﬁlling factors, the summations of the areas for negative and positive polarities and the whole
magnetic features were divided by the size of the selected box in each frame. Figure 2a shows the area ﬁlling
factors of both positive (red line) and negative (blue line) elements for the ﬂaring AR with the peak times of
ﬂaring phase (vertical dashed lines). As it is seen, before the occurrence of the M-type ﬂare (during C-type
ﬂaring phase), the lines of the area ﬁlling factors of positive and negative elements intersect. In contrast,
the summation of ﬁlling factors belonging to the both polarities is constant during ﬂaring periods. Figure
2b shows the area ﬁlling factors of positive (red line) and negative (blue line) elements for the non-ﬂaring
AR. At the beginning of the fourth day of our analyzes (6 November 2015) over the non-ﬂaring AR, the
lines of the area ﬁlling factors of positive and negative elements intersect, and the whole ﬁlling factor of the
non-ﬂaring AR grows to reach up about two times of that in the previous day. Figure 2c compares the area
ﬁlling factors of all magnetic features with their mean values in both ARs. The whole ﬁlling factor in the
ﬂaring AR (
0.084). In Figure
3, the number of the magnetic patches separately for positive (red line) and negative (blue line) elements
for the ﬂaring AR (upper panel) and the non-ﬂaring AR (lower panel) are displayed. The mean value of the
total number of magnetic patches calculated for the ﬂaring AR (
1241) is about six times of the non-ﬂaring
220). The summations of negative, positive, and total ﬂux of patches with their mean values for both
one (
1020 Mx) is about
ARs are plotted in Figure 4. The mean value of ﬂux summation in the ﬂaring AR (
14 times of that obtained for the non-ﬂaring AR (

0.499) takes the value approximately six times that of the non-ﬂaring AR (

1020 Mx).

ii. Pearson correlation coefﬁcients between time series

The Pearson correlation between the ﬁlling factors of the positive and negative elements of the ﬂaring AR
and the non-ﬂaring AR were obtained to be -0.88 and 0.97, respectively. The Pearson correlation between
the number of positive and negative elements of the ﬂaring AR and the non-ﬂaring AR were computed
to be -0.64 and 0.19, respectively. As we see in Table 2, the anti-correlated behaviors between the total
number of elements and total ﬁlling factor in the ﬂaring AR (
0.20)
represent that the number of the patches increases by decreasing the area ﬁlling factor in ARs. On the
other hand, the negative and positive ﬂuxes in both ARs have positively correlated behaviors about 0.88 and
0.93, respectively. The measurement of the probability value (p-value) test determines the validity of linear
correlation between the two time-series. It would take any values in the range of 0 and 1. The p-values
less than 0.05 imply that the conﬁdence level of obtained correlations is statistically valid (e.g. Everitt 2002,
Noori et al. 2019). As it is seen in Table 2, the probabilities of ﬁnding differences for all time-series were
computed to be less than 0.1%.

iii. Flux-, size-, and lifetime-distribution of magnetic elements

The ﬂux-frequency, size-frequency, and lifetime-frequency distributions of all magnetic polarities in the
ﬂaring AR are plotted on a log-log scale in Figure 5. We ﬁtted the thresholded power-law function to the
distributions, f (x), which is deﬁned as

f (x) = f0(x0 + x)θ,
where x is the array of data points, f0 is a normalization constant, x0 is a threshold, and θ is the exponent
which takes the negative value (for more details, see Aschwanden 2015). The genetic algorithm (e.g., Fogel et
al.1966, Mitchell 1996) was used to ﬁnd the best model for data points in the procedure of the minimization
the chi-square function (For astronomical applications of the genetic algorithm in minimization of chi-square
function, the reader can refer to Cantó et al. (2009), and also, Farhang et al. (2018)). In our distributions, the
parameter x0 was determined to be smaller than the lower bound of the observed data points, xmin. So, we
(x)θ (i.e. (x0 < xmin) for all data points in following calculations
can use the approximation (x0 + x)θ

(see subsection 3.5). Thus, the power exponents of ﬂux, size, and lifetime were obtained to be

of the ﬂaring AR is greater than that of the non-ﬂaring AR. It was revealed that 98% of patches have lifetimes
shorter than 100 minute. There were ﬁve patches (
0.004% of the elements) which have lifetimes longer
∼
than 10 hours. To be sure that the approximation as mentioned earlier gives the accurate exponents, we also
employed the maximum likelihood estimator method (MLE: Clauset et al. 2009) to apply the whole range of
the power-law distributions. The MLE method’s task is to estimate the parameters of a model ﬁtted to the
frequency distribution by maximizing a likelihood function. For the power-law function with the exponent
of η and the lower bound of the observed data points xmin, the following form is used as a model

This relation holds for η > 1 and xmin can take any values greater than 0. The slope of ﬁt extracted from the
MLE is deﬁned as

In Figure 7, patches with the maximum values of ﬂux, size, and lifetime identiﬁed by the code in the ﬂaring
1020 Mx (Figure 7,
AR are presented. The maximum value of the mean ﬂux belonged to a patch is 23.54
two ﬁrst rows). This patch has a lifetime of about 165 minutes and a mean size of 296.12 Mm2. The mean
size’s maximum value belonged to a patch is 299.65 Mm2 (Figure 7, two middle rows). This patch has a life-
1020 Mx. Also, the lifetime’s maximum value belonged

mean size of 9.19 Mm2. In Figure 8, patches with the maximum values of ﬂux, size, and lifetime identiﬁed
by the code in non-ﬂaring AR are displayed. In this area, the mean ﬂux’s maximum value belonged to a
1020 Mx (Figure 8, two ﬁrst rows). This patch has a lifetime of about 16 minutes and a mean
patch is 2.46
size of 79.39 Mm2. The mean size’s maximum value belonged to a patch is 97.23 Mm2 (Figure 8, two middle
1020 Mx. Also, the lifetime’s
rows). This patch has a lifetime of about one hour and a mean ﬂux of 2.02
maximum value belonged to a patch is 756 minutes (Figure 8, two last rows). This patch has a mean ﬂux
1018 Mx and mean size of 9.73 Mm2. The positively correlated behavior of ﬂux and the size of
of 6.77
magnetic elements is seen in both ARs. Furthermore, there are differences between the parameters obtained
from the ﬂaring AR and the non-ﬂaring AR. The values of the maximum ﬂux and size in the ﬂaring AR are
more remarkable than that of the non-ﬂaring AR.

v. Empirical scaling relations between ﬂux, size, and lifetime of the magnetic
elements

±

For magnetic elements that appeared in the ﬂaring AR, the relations between ﬂux [FFAR], size [SFAR], and
lifetime [TFAR] are presented in Figure 9 (FAR is the abbreviation of "ﬂaring active region"). The scatter plot
of the mean size [Mm2] versus mean ﬂux [1018 Mx] of patches over their lifetimes is shown on a log-log
scale in Figure 9 (upper panel). It is seen that the greater ﬂuxes are more scattered in size and more than
0.99% of patches have ﬂuxes lower than 1020 Mx. Also, more than 0.97% of patches have sizes lower than
10 Mm2. Applying the linear ﬁt to the mean values (red points) of each bin (0 – 0.2, 0.2 – 0.4 [
1018 Mx],
×
etc.) revealed that the relation between the size and ﬂux could be expressed as SFAR
FAR, with a best-ﬁt
parameter of a = 0.66
0.01 (R-square = 0.91). A closer look exposes that there may be a break in this
scatter plot. Fitting a broken double linear function shows a gentle slope of about 0.43 (Figure 9, yellow
1019 Mx and sizes < 15 Mm2. For greater
line in upper panel) between the ﬂux and size, for ﬂuxes < 8
ﬂuxes and sizes, the slope takes value of about 0.93 (Figure 9, upper panel). It may suggest that after this
limit, the correlated behavior of the ﬂux and size signiﬁcantly increases in the ﬂaring AR. The scatter plot
of the mean ﬂux versus the patches’ lifetime is presented on a log-log scale in Figure 9 (middle panel). We
can see that patches at any lifetime range, especially in shorter intervals, are more scattered in the ﬂux. We
applied the linear ﬁt to the mean values (red points) of each bin (0 – 1, 1 – 2 [minutes], etc.) to ﬁnd the
relation between the mean ﬂux [1018 Mx] of patches during their lifetimes and the lifetimes [minutes]. The
relation is FFAR
0.04 (R-square = 0.38). The scatter plot of the mean size versus the
patches’ lifetime is presented on a log-log scale in Figure 9 (lower panel). As same as the last panel, we see
that patches with various lifetimes have a large scatter in their sizes. The linear ﬁt to the mean values (red
points) of each bin (0 – 1, 1 – 2 [minutes], etc.) was applied to extract the power-law relation as SFAR
0.02 (R-square = 0.50).

1018 Mx], etc.)

In the same manner as Figure 9, for magnetic elements appeared in the non-ﬂaring AR, the relations
between ﬂux [FAR], size [SAR], and lifetime [TAR] are presented in Figure 10. The scatter plot of the mean
size [Mm2] versus mean ﬂux [1018 Mx] of patches over their lifetimes is shown on a log-log scale in Figure
10 (upper panel). It is seen that the greater ﬂuxes are more scattered in size and more than 0.99% of patches
have ﬂuxes lower than 1020 Mx. Also, more than 0.96% of patches have sizes lower than 10 Mm2. Applying
revealed
the linear ﬁt to the mean values (red points) of each bin (0 – 0.2, 0.2 – 0.4 [
g
that the relation between the size and ﬂux could be expressed as SAR
AR, with a best-ﬁt parameter of
g = 0.64
0.02 (R-square = 0.90). As same as Figure 9, ﬁtting a broken double linear function reveals that
for ﬂuxes < 2
1019 Mx and sizes < 15 Mm2, the slope is obtained to be about 0.55 (Figure 10, yellow line
in upper panel). For the greater ﬂuxes and sizes, the slope takes the value of about 0.81 (Figure 10, green
line in upper panel). The scatter plot of the mean ﬂux versus the patches’ lifetime is presented on a log-log
scale in Figure 10 (middle panel). We can see that patches at any ranges of lifetimes are more scattered in
ﬂux. We applied the linear ﬁt to the mean values (red points) of each bin (0 – 1, 1 – 2 [minutes], etc.) to ﬁnd
the relation between the mean ﬂux [1018 Mx] of patches during their lifetimes and the lifetimes [minutes].
The relationship is FAR
0.06 (R-square = 0.16). The scatter plot of the mean size
versus the patches’ lifetime is presented on a log-log scale in Figure 10 (lower panel). Similar to the previous
panel, we see that patches with various lifetimes have a large scatter in their sizes. The linear ﬁt to the mean
values (red points) of each bin (0 – 1, 1 – 2 [minutes], etc.) was applied to extract the power-law relation as
SAR

Let us assume two power-law distributions with functionality of variables x and y as the forms of
ny , respectively. The relation between two variables can be speciﬁed by y ∝ xm,

For the ﬂaring AR, the power-law indices of ﬂux (nF), size (nS), and lifetime (nT) extracted from fre-
quency distributions (see Figure 5) were obtained to be about 2.36, 3.11, and 1.70, respectively. Replacing a
pair of the power indices in Eq. 5, the corresponding scaling laws are achieved

SFAR ∝ F0.64
FAR,

FFAR ∝ T0.51
FAR,

SFAR ∝ T0.33
FAR.

(6)

For the non-ﬂaring AR, these power-law indices which were extracted from frequency distributions (see
Figure 6) were about 2.53, 3.42, and 1.61, respectively.

SAR ∝ F0.63
AR ,

FAR ∝ T0.39
AR ,

SAR ∝ T0.25
AR .

(7)

As it is seen, these obtained scaling values for the ﬂaring AR and the non-ﬂaring-AR are in good agreement
with results extracted from Figures 9 and 10, respectively.

vi. Empirical scaling relation between size and growth rate of magnetic ele-
ments

As it was mentioned in Section 1, (Otsuji et al. 2011) obtained a power-law relation between the maximum
ﬂux of positive magnetic polarities Fmax and their ﬂux growth rate < dF
dt

> as follows

< dF
dt

>∝ F0.5
max,

(8)

where t is the time of ﬂux growth and
denotes the mean value. In Figure 11, the scatter plot of the mean
size of the positive polarities versus their maximum ﬂux on a log-log scale for the ﬂaring AR (upper panel)
and for the non-ﬂaring AR (lower panel) is plotted. As it is seen, the scaling relation between the mean size
of the positive polarities and their maximum ﬂux takes the relation as S ∝ F0.64
max (R-square = 0.90) for the
ﬂaring AR and S ∝ F0.68
max (R-square = 0.93) for the non-ﬂaring AR. The relation between the ﬂux growth rate
of the positive polarities and their size can be yielded with the use of Eq. 8 as follows

hi

>∝ S0.78

< dF
dt
>∝ S0.73

< dF
dt

for the ﬂaring AR,

for the non

ﬂaring AR.

−

(9)

This power-law relation indicates that there is strong correlation between the maximum ﬂux growth rate of
the positive polarities and their size in both ARs.

IV. Conclusions

The number of 347502 and 114063 photospheric magnetic elements was automatically detected in the ﬂaring
AR (NOAA 12443) and in the non-ﬂaring AR (NOAA 12446), respectively, over the HMI consecutive sub-
images. Among identiﬁed patches, the largest one’s label belonged to a patch with a mean area of about
300 Mm2. Furthermore, we found a patch with the maximum ﬂux of 23.54
1020 Mx. The most long-lived
37 hours). Expectedly, all these patches were appeared in the ﬂaring
patch has a lifetime of 2208 minutes (
AR. Statistical analyzes show that both the mean value of the area ﬁlling factor and the ﬂux summation of
the magnetic patches in the ﬂaring AR are more than those of the non-ﬂaring AR. The greater value of the
number of elements in the ﬂaring AR implies the more complexity of the patches’ system in this area, which
may rise the possibility of ﬂare occurrence. All frequency distributions of ﬂux, size, and lifetime in both
ARs follow power-law functions indicating their scale-invariant behavior. Data-truncation effects caused by
applying detection thresholds on both size and magnetic ﬁeld of the patches can lead to a little deviations
from ideal power laws, as seen in the distributions. According to the ﬁtted broken double linear functions
to the scatter plots of ﬂux and size, it can be inferred that the start ﬂux range of signiﬁcant increases in the
correlated behavior of ﬂux and size of patches is 2 – 8 [

1019 Mx].

As a comparison between the power-law exponents of the ﬂux-distribution and size-distribution of the
patches in both ARs, the greater magnitude value of slopes of both distributions in the non-ﬂaring AR
suggests that the contribution of small scale events in ﬂux and size belonging to this area is more than that
of the ﬂaring AR.

On the contrary of the anti-correlated behavior which is observed in the ﬁlling factor of the negative
and positive polarities (with the Pearson value of -0.88) in the ﬂaring AR, the ﬁlling factor of the positive
and negative polarities in the non-ﬂaring AR are signiﬁcantly correlated (with the Pearson correlation value
of 0.97). The weak anti-correlated behavior between the total area ﬁlling factors and the total number of
patches in both ARs would imply that the area ﬁlling factor decreases by increasing the number of patches.
On the other hand, the Pearson correlation values between the time series of the positive and negative
ﬂux in the ﬂaring AR (
0.93) show that the ﬂux of both polarities are
signiﬁcantly correlated in both ARs.

The scaling laws obtained from the relations between the size and ﬂux of the patches in the ﬂaring AR
(S ∝ F0.66) and in the non-ﬂaring AR (S ∝ F0.64), and also, some given samples of time-series of size and
ﬂux with highly correlated manner indicate that the size and ﬂux are signiﬁcantly correlated in both ARs.
Moreover, in the previous reports, the relation between the size and ﬂux of patches appeared in the QS
can be expressed by S ∝ F0.64 (Javaherian et al. 2017). So, we can say that there would be the universality
in the relation between the size and ﬂux of patches all over the solar photosphere. On the other hand,
the relations between the ﬂux and lifetime (F ∝ T0.48), and also, the relation between the size and lifetime
(S ∝ T0.32) demonstrate that the size and lifetime, and also, the ﬂux and lifetime are moderately correlated
in the ﬂaring AR; these obtained relations for the non-ﬂaring AR which can be indicated as F ∝ T0.37 and
S ∝ T0.23 reveal that those parameters are weakly correlated in the ﬂaring AR. As previously reported by
Javaherian et al. (2017), for the QS, the relation between the ﬂux and lifetime of patches, and also the relation
between their size and lifetime were speciﬁed as F ∝ T0.38 and S ∝ T0.25, respectively. It suggests that the
correlated behavior between the ﬂux and lifetime, and also, the relation between the size and lifetime in
the QS, is a bit more than that of the non-ﬂaring AR and less than that of the ﬂaring AR. Moreover, the
strong correlation between the maximum ﬂux growth rate of the positive polarities and their size, which is
obtained as < dF/dt >∝ S0.7 in both AR, reveals that the ﬂux growth rate increases with increasing the size
of the positive polarities.
