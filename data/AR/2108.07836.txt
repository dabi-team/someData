Abstract

Using molecular simulation, we determine Ginzburg-Landau free energy func-
tions for molecular ﬂuids. To this aim, we extend the Expanded Wang-
Landau method to calculate the partition functions, number distributions
and Landau free energies for Ar, CO2 and H2O. We then parametrize a
coarse-grained free energy function of the density order parameter and as-
sess the performance of this free energy function on its ability to model the
onset of criticality in these systems. The resulting parameters can be readily
used in hybrid atomistic/continuum simulations that connect the microscopic
and mesoscopic length scales.

1. Introduction

In recent years, there have been tremendous developments in numerical
methods that bridge between the microscopic length scale and the mesoscopic
scale. Such methods include e.g. density functional methods [1], phase-
ﬁeld simulations [2] and hybrid atomistic-continuum simulations [3]. These
simulations have shed light on a wide range of phenomena, from the kinetics
of phase transitions to the emergence of ordered phase [4], either through the
nucleation of a new phase or through spinodal decomposition. These methods
have also the advantage of being extremely versatile since they can be applied
to understand the nucleation process in metal alloys [2] and water [5], to

model the ordering process in polymers [6] and in shape memory alloys [7].
Such calculations rely on the use of phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau free
energy functions that characterize the evolution of free energy during the
process. To allow for accurate predictions, the parameters for these functions
need to be determined on the basis of the underlying microscopic nature and
properties of the system. This, in turn, leads to an eﬃcient way of linking
the two length scales.

Molecular simulations provide a direct access to the prediction of ther-
modynamics properties from a molecular model and, as such, can be used
to extract the parameters for these Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy func-
tions in a self-consistent way. Previous work on the topic has shed light on
the behavior of model systems [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] close to the critical point
and on the relation between the composition and the chemical potential for
metal alloys [13]. In particular, it was shown [8, 9, 10] how a coarse-grained
free energy function could be developed for such systems, leading to the de-
termination of their critical properties. In this work, we extend a recently
developed simulation method, known as the Expanded Wang-Landau ap-
proach [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], to calculate directly the grand-canonical partition
function for molecular ﬂuids. This allows us to evaluate the number distri-
butions and the Landau free energy of the system over a wide range of condi-
tions of temperature and chemical potential (or, equivalently, pressure). We
assess the accuracy of the method on Argon and then focus on two molec-
ular ﬂuids, carbon dioxide and water. For each system, we parametrize a
Ginzburg-Landau free energy function by ﬁtting an expansion in the density
order parameter and analyze the behavior of the coeﬃcients in the expansion
for the 3 systems considered here.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss how
the EWL method can be used to determine the partition functions, number
distributions and Landau free energy surfaces. We also present the simulation
models used for Ar, CO2 and H2O. We then discuss the simulation results
and detail how we carry out the parametrization of the free energy function.
We also focus on analyzing the temperature dependence of the coeﬃcients for
the free energy functions and compare their behavior to that expected from
Landau’s theory. We ﬁnally draw our main conclusions in the last section.

2. Simulation Methods

The Expanded Wang-Landau (EWL) method [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] is a
grand-canonical Monte Carlo (MC) simulation that was developed by com-
bining a ﬂat histogram sampling technique, known as Wang-Landau sam-
pling [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] with a multi-stage (expanded ensemble) process
for the insertion and deletion of molecules [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,
34, 35, 36]. During EWL simulations, the simulated system is composed of
N molecules and of a fractional molecule at stage l, where l is an integer
varying from 0 (void fractional molecule) to M − 1, M being the maximum
l characterizes the ”size” of the fractional molecule and
number of stages.
interacts with the full (regular) molecules accordingly, and the conventional
insertion/deletion steps are replaced by steps consisting of changes in the
stage value l for the fractional molecule. The Wang-Landau part of the
method allows for the dynamic evaluation of the canonical partitions func-
tions Q(N, V, T, l) for the system. For any value of the chemical potential µ,
the grand-canonical partition function Θ(µ, V, T ) is then obtained by sum-
ming up over N the functions Q(N, V, T, l = 0) (we drop the speciﬁcation
l = 0 in the rest of the paper) according to

where qtrans and qrot are the translational and rotational partition functions
for a single molecule [37] and Γ denotes a speciﬁc conﬁguration of the sys-
tem. The staged insertion/deletion steps in the EWL method ensures a high
acceptance rate for these MC moves, which, in turn, yields highly accurate
values for the partition functions [14, 22].

The interactions between atoms of diﬀerent molecules are modeled with
the following force ﬁelds. For CO2, we use the TraPPE potential [38], in
which each molecule is modeled as a distribution of 3 Lennard-Jones (LJ)
sites and of three point charges located on each atom. The interaction be-
tween atoms i and j is given by

with the following parameters: (cid:15)OO/kB = 79 K, σOO = 3.05 ˚A, (cid:15)CC/kB =
27 K and σCC = 2.8 ˚A for the LJ parameters and qC = 0.7e (and qO =
−qC/2). The interaction between an atom of the fractional molecule with an
atom of a full molecule is also calculated through Eq. 3 with the interaction
parameters (cid:15)ij, σij and the product qiqj being scaled by (l/M )1/3, (l/M )1/4
and (l/M )1/3, respectively. The size of the fractional molecule (i.e. the bond
length between C and O) is also scaled by (l/M )1/3. For H2O, we use the
SPC/E force ﬁeld [39], with (cid:15)OO/kB = 78.197 K, σOO = 3.166 ˚A and qO =
−0.8476e (and qH = −qO/2). The interaction potential is also calculated
using Eq. 3, and the same scaling as for CO2 is applied for the fractional-full
interaction and for the size of the fractional molecule. To model Argon, we
use a LJ potential with (cid:15)/kB = 117.05 K and σ = 3.4 ˚A and use the same
scaling for the fractional-full interactions as for CO2 and H2O.

We carry out EWL simulations with the following probabilities for each
type of MC steps: 37.5% of the attempted MC moves are translations of a
single molecule (full or fractional), 37.5% are rotations of a single molecule
(full or fractional) and the 25 % remaining moves are changes in (N, l) values.
In the case of Ar, the only possible MC step are translations (75%) or changes
in (N, l) (25%). The number of stages M is set to 100, the starting value for
the convergence factor f in the iterative Wang-Landau scheme to e, its ﬁnal
value to 10−8, with each (N, l) value being visited at least 1000 times for
a given value of f , leading to a statistical uncertainty in the predicted free
energies of the order of 0.02 % with a computational eﬃciency comparable
to that of other ﬂat-histogram methods such as e.g. the Transition Matrix
Monte Carlo method [31]. Simulations are carried out on cubic cells for all
systems, with periodic boundary conditions, and sample N values between 0
and 500 for Argon and CO2 and between 0 and 300 for H2O. The usual tail
corrections are applied beyond the cutoﬀ distance (set to half the boxlength),
and Ewald sums are used to calculate the long-range electrostatic interactions
(with the same parameters as in ref. [16]).

3. Results and Discussion

The dynamical evaluation carried out during the EWL method results in
the direct determination of the grand-canonical partition function Θ(µ, V, T )
and of the Q(N, V, T ) functions. The left panel in Fig. 1 shows these func-
tions for Ar over temperatures ranging from 122.9 K to 187.3 K. At low
temperatures, Θ(µ, V, T ) exhibits a sharp increase above a threshold value

4

for µ, corresponding to the vapor → liquid transition that occurs in the ﬂuid.
As shown in Fig. 1, this threshold value is shifted towards the lower end of
the range of µ as temperature increases, with an oﬀset of approximately
4 % every 6 K. This shift is related to the change in slope of log Q(N, V, T ),
which decreases with temperature (see Top of Fig. 1). At high temperatures
(T > 160 K), log Θ(µ, V, T ) exhibits a smoother increase with µ. This be-
havior is associated with a continuous increase in density with µ for these
temperatures, or, in other words, to the fact that the ﬂuid has become super-
critical. We then deﬁne the number distribution p(N ) from Θ(µ, V, T ) and
Q(N, V, T ) as

p(N ) =

Q(N, V, T ) exp (βµN )
Θ(µ, V, T )

(4)

The number distribution p(N ) allows us to calculate the average density of
the ﬂuid < ρ > for a single phase system through

as well as the conditions of vapor-liquid coexistence by numerically solving
the following equation

(6)

where Nb is the point at which the function p(N ) reaches its minimum, and
the left hand side and the right hand side of the equation correspond to the
probability of the vapor and of the liquid phase, respectively.

Fig. 1 also shows the number distributions obtained at the vapor-liquid
coexistence (µ = −302.32 kJ/kg for T = 140.5 K) and for a supercriti-
cal ﬂuid, with an average density equal to the critical density of Ar (µ =
−413.07 kJ/kg for T = 187.3 K). The number distributions so obtained
display the expected change from a bimodal distribution below the critical
temperature to a unimodal distribution above the critical point. To assess
further this point, we calculate the fourth order Binder cumulant[8] U4 for
subcritical and supercritical Ar. U4 is a function of the density order param-
eter, δρ = ρ− < ρ >, and is given by

U4 = 1 −

< δρ4 >
3 < δρ2 >2

5

(7)

U4 is shown in Fig. 1 for temperatures ranging from 122.9 K to 187.3 K. For
temperatures below 140.5 K, U4 is close to 2/3 and slowly decreases with T .
There is then a sharp drop in U4, which becomes close to 0 for temperatures
above 160 K, conﬁrming that Ar is supercritical at these temperatures.

We now turn to the calculation of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy

Λ. We determine Λ from the number distribution p(N ) as

Λ = −kBT log p(N )

(8)

In Eq. 8, Λ depends upon the chemical potential µ and the temperature T
through p(N ). We add that Λ also depends implicitly on the system size,
here characterized by L, the edge of the cubic cell for the simulation.

Fig. 2 shows the variations of Λ against µ and δρ in the vicinity of the
vapor-liquid coexistence for CO2. The 3D plot shows two valleys, corre-
sponding to the two most probable phases, i.e. the vapor phase for δρ < 0
and the liquid phase for δρ > 0, separated by a ridge around < ρ >. The
ridge appears to bend across the range of µ, as a result of the increase in
< ρ > with µ. This change in < ρ > results from the transition from the
density of the vapor phase for µ below its value at coexistence µcoex to the
density of the liquid phase for µ > µcoex. At coexistence, < ρ > is located at
the center of the interval deﬁned by the densities of the the two coexisting
phases, since we have two equally probable phases.

We show in Fig. 3 the curves for the Landau free energy against δρ,
obtained at coexistence for temperatures ranging from T = 250 K to T =
450 K. These free energy plots exhibit in all cases two free energy minima,
which become closer and closer to each other as temperature increases, and
as the system approaches the critical point. Fig. 3 shows that the free energy
barrier associated with the passage from one minimum to the other decreases
steadily with temperature [40, 41]. Speciﬁcally, in the case of CO2, the free
energy barrier decreases by 62 % from T = 250 K to T = 280 K, which
implies that the nucleation of droplets or of bubbles becomes easier as T
increases and that the surface tension undergoes a notable decrease with T .
For temperatures of 350 K and above, Λ exhibits a single minimum, which
conﬁrms that CO2 is supercritical under such conditions.

To parametrize a GL free energy function, we coarse-grained Λ in terms of
an expansion in the order parameter δρ. This consists in ﬁtting the simulation
results for Λ, shown on the left of Fig. 3, with the following polynomial

The right panel in Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the even coeﬃcients C0,
C2 and C4 upon temperature. We ﬁnd that the two odd terms C1 and C3
are very close to 0 and that they do not impact the value of the other coeﬃ-
cients, in agreement with the theoretical results [42] and previous results on
the unshifted truncated Lennard-Jones model [10]. While the C0 and C4 co-
eﬃcients are found to exhibit a sharp drop when CO2 becomes supercritical,
C2 is found to vary linearly with temperature across the entire temperature
range. This behavior for C2 is consistent with theoretical predictions [42],
which state that C2 is proportional to a0(T − Tc) where a0 is a positive co-
eﬃcient [42], and, as a result, changes sign as CO2 undergoes the transition
from a subcritical to a supercritical ﬂuid. This is indeed what we ﬁnd here
for C2, as the curve for C2 against T crosses the x−axis for a temperature of
295 ± 25 K. This provides an estimate for a mean-ﬁeld critical temperature,
that is in good agreement with the experimental data (Tc = 304.2 K) [43]
and prior estimates from simulation studies [38, 44]. To assess the reliability
of this estimate, we calculate the density of the vapor ρv and of the liquid
ρl at coexistence from the number distribution p(N ) and ﬁt the diﬀerence
between these two densities with a scaling law for the temperature. We use
the following law: ρl − ρv = B(T − Tc)β, where B is a ﬁtting parameter
and β is the mean-ﬁeld critical exponent of 0.5. This provides an estimate
of 330 ± 30 K for the mean-ﬁeld critical temperature. The good agreement
obtained between the two mean-ﬁeld estimates conﬁrms the reliability of the
GL free energy function and of the Ci parameters determined here. Carry-
ing out the same analysis for the other two systems, Ar and H2O, leads to
similar results. In the case of Ar, we ﬁnd that the curve for C2 against T
crosses the x−axis for a temperature of 152±10 K, leading to an estimate for
a mean-ﬁeld critical temperature in good agreement with the experimental
data (150.9 K) [43]. Furthermore, using the scaling law of the temperature
with the mean-ﬁeld critical exponent β = 0.5 yields an estimate of 161±15 K
for the mean-ﬁeld critical temperature, which is consistent with the estimate
obtained from the C2 coeﬃcient. Finally, for H2O, we ﬁnd that, throughout
the temperature range, the variations for C2 as a function of T are accurately
modeled with a linear ﬁt, allowing us to estimate a mean-ﬁeld critical tem-
perature for water of 640 ± 30 K on the basis of this ﬁt. This is reasonably

10

close to the experimental data [43] for the critical temperature (647 K) and
to the estimate made on the basis of the scaling law for the temperature
(677 ± 45 K). This set of results validates the coarse-grained procedure for
the GL free energy of water, and shows that the EWL method can be applied
to determine GL free energy functions for molecular ﬂuids.

We now turn to the comparison between the results obtained for the
coeﬃcients C0, C2 and C4 for the 3 systems studied in this work. For this
purpose, we deﬁne the reduced temperature t = (T − Tc,i)/Tc,i, in which Tc,i
is the mean-ﬁeld critical temperature determined above for i = Ar, CO2 or
H2O, and scale the results for C0, C2 and C4 as follows. In the case of C0,
we observe that, for t < 0, the results exhibit a linear variation in t and
we use the slope as the scaling factor (equal to 206.4 for Ar, 791.7 for CO2
and 482.0 for H2O, all quantities given in kJ/mol). C2 exhibits a linear
variation across the entire temperature range for the 3 systems and we use
the slope as the scaling factor (equal to 1425.4 for Ar, 6613.8 for CO2 and
6888.8 for H2O, all quantities given in kJ/mol/(g/cm3)2). In the case of C4,
we use the maximum value taken by this coeﬃcient as the scaling factor, as
in previous work [10] (equal to 458.1 for Ar, 1944.9 for CO2 and 4340.8 for
H2O, all quantities given in kJ/mol/(g/cm3)4). The scaled coeﬃcients are
shown in Fig. 4 and show that remarkably similar behaviors are observed
for the 3 systems. Below the critical temperature (t < 0), all coeﬃcients
exhibit the same linear behavior as a function of t and the results for the
3 systems can be superimposed on each other, as shown in Fig. 4(a) for
the C0 coeﬃcients, in Fig. 4(b) for the C2 coeﬃcients, and in Fig. 4(c) for
the C4 coeﬃcients. Furthermore, the linear behavior observed for the C2
coeﬃcients extends over the whole range of values for t, as expected from
the theoretical predictions [42]. The overall behavior observed for the scaled
coeﬃcients further establishes the consistency of the results obtained for the
coarse-grained GL free energy functions for the 3 systems.

4. Conclusions

In this work, we extend the Expanded Wang-Landau simulation method
to determine the grand-canonical partition function Θ(µ, V, T ), the related
Q(N, V, T ) functions and number distributions. This allows us to calculate
the Landau free energy surfaces of molecular ﬂuids over a wide range of tem-
peratures and chemical potentials. We then parametrize the coeﬃcients for
a Ginzburg-Landau free energy function by coarse-graining the Landau free

energy in a polynomial function of the density order parameter δρ. This ap-
proach is applied to Argon, CO2 and H2O and provides the following picture
for the three systems. At subcritical temperatures, the Landau free energy
surfaces show that increasing the temperature leads to a narrowing of the
gap, in terms of δρ, between the two coexisting phases and to a decrease
in the Landau free energy barrier connecting these two minima. On the
other hand, for the supercritical ﬂuid, we ﬁnd that the Landau free energy
exhibits a single minimum around δρ = 0. The coarse-grained GL free en-
ergy function shows that only the even terms of the expansion contribute
notably, with the constant and the quartic term undergoing a sharp drop as
the ﬂuid becomes supercritical. The quadratic term in the GL function is
shown to vary linearly with T and to change sign, becoming positive at high
(supercritical) temperature as expected from Landau’s theory. This change
in sign provides an estimate for the mean-ﬁeld critical temperature that is
in good agreement with that obtained from a scaling law for the tempera-
ture with a mean-ﬁeld critical exponent. This set of results, together with
the good agreement obtained between the two estimates for the mean-ﬁeld
critical temperature, validates the use of the EWL method to determine and
coarse-grained GL free energy functions for molecular ﬂuids. The method
discussed in this work provides a direct link between the microscopic force
ﬁeld and properties of the molecular ﬂuids and the coeﬃcients for the GL free
energy function, thereby allowing to connect the microscopic and mesoscopic
length scales [5, 45]. The resulting coeﬃcients can be readily used in hybrid
atomistic/continuum simulations schemes.
