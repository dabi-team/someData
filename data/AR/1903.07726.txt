Background: The study of low–energy neutrinos and their interactions with atomic nuclei is
crucial to several open problems in physics, including the neutrino mass hierarchy, CP–violation,
candidates of Beyond Standard Model physics and supernova dynamics. Examples of experiments
include CAPTAIN at SNS as well as DUNE’s planned detection program of supernova neutrinos.

Purpose: We present cross section calculations for charged current and neutral current neutrino–
nucleus scattering at low energies, with a focus on 40Ar. We also take a close look at pion decay–
at–rest neutrino spectra, which are used in e.g. the SNS experiment at Oakridge.

Method and results: We employ a Hartree Fock + Continuum Random Phase Approximations
(HF+CRPA) framework, which allows us to model the responses and include the eﬀects of long–
range correlations. It is expected to provide a good framework to calculate forbidden transitions,
whose contribution we show to be non–negligible.

Conclusions: Forbidden transitions can be expected to contribute sizeably to the reaction
strength at typical low–energy kinematics, such as DAR neutrinos. Modeling and Monte Carlo
simulations need to take all due care to account for the inﬂuence of their contributions.

INTRODUCTION

Within the realm of neutrino physics, one area of re-
search that has a lot of potential for exciting new dis-
coveries lies in the study of low-energy neutrinos. The
interaction of these with atomic nuclei provides crucial
information needed for several open questions in physics.
DUNE [1, 2] can, for example, as part of their low–energy
(LE) neutrino program, distinguish between the two hi-
erarchy scenarios in the detection of supernova neutrinos
as explained in e.g. [3], where mention is also made of
the prospect to probe Beyond Standard Model (BSM)
physics such as sterile neutrinos, neutrino magnetic mo-
ments and Non–Standard Interactions (NSI). Further-
more, the measurement of low–energy neutrinos is cru-
cial to supernova research, where detecting the outgoing
neutrinos can be used to study the underlying super-
nova dynamics and the interactions that the neutrinos
engage in [3]. Finally, another avenue worth mentioning
lies in the experimental measurement of coherent elastic
neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) [4–6].

Inelastic cross sections induced by low–energy neutri-
nos (10s of MeVs) have been measured in the past for
carbon and iron by the LSND and KARMEN collabora-
tions [7, 8]. Several experiments have been proposed for
the near future to measure supernova neutrinos at higher
precision, including the aforementioned DUNE as well as
e.g. JUNO [9] and Hyper-Kamiokande [10]. These require
signiﬁcant research and development eﬀorts in order to

properly calibrate the detectors that are to be used, in-
cluding a better knowledge of the cross sections. One
necessity is to have access to neutrinos of similar kine-
matics to those produced in supernovae. The Spallation
Neutrino Source at Oakridge (SNS) [11] is an example of
such a facility. As a byproduct of its primary purpose
of producing neutrons, the SNS also creates neutrinos
of several ﬂavors. These are born out of pions decaying
at rest (DAR), yielding monoenergetic muon neutrinos
at Eνµ = 29.8 MeV as well as electron neutrinos and
muon antineutrinos, with their normalized ﬂux pictured
in Fig. 1, the well–known Michel spectra. Part of the
CAPTAIN [12] program is to have the CAPTAIN Liq-
uid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LarTPC) detec-

for NC. In turn, GF is the Fermi constant that encodes
the strength of the weak interaction, while cos θc is the
Cabibbo angle. The factor ζ 2(Z (cid:48), Ef ) is related to the
Coulomb interaction between the escaping lepton and the
residual nucleus. In the case of NC, it is simply 1. We will
come back to the speciﬁcs of this factor further on. The
cross section also diﬀers for neutrinos and antineutrinos
due to the V–A nature of the electroweak interaction,
as shown by the
–sign in the transverse interference
term. The v–factors are the leptonic functions, while
the W –factors are the nuclear response functions, which
contain all the nuclear information on the reaction to the
electroweak probe. They are a function of the transition
amplitude between the initial

found in e.g. [48]. Worth mentioning at this stage in the
context of low–energy neutrinos, is the ’allowed approxi-
mation’. Under this approximation, valid at low energies
and typically used in beta–decay calculations, it is cus-
tomary to employ both the long–wavelength limit q

and to assume that one is dealing with slow nucleons

tor run at the SNS [13]. This will yield crucial infor-
mation on the neutrino-nucleus cross sections, but also
on how to characterize these events in the analyses. A
proper analysis of all the produced particles is a necessity
to perform accurate calorimetry in SN neutrino experi-
ments. Since it is of relevance to further discussions in
this paper, we also make mention of the fact that special-
ized event generators are required for simulations, since
most like NuWro [14], NEUT [15] and GENIE [16] are
tailored towards higher-energy scenarios. DUNE uses
MARLEY [17], for example, to model charged current
interactions between LE neutrinos and 40Ar.

Parallel to all of these developments lies a need to
theoretically study and model cross-sections for charged
current (CC) and neutral current (NC) interactions of
SN neutrinos with nuclei. Past eﬀorts to that eﬀect in-
clude calculations performed in RPA frameworks such
as Refs. [18–24], shell model [25–28] (or hybrid mod-
els of the two [29–32]) as well as QRPA [33–35], rela-
tivistic (R)QRPA [36] and local Fermi Gas–based RPA
approaches [37–39]. We also mention previous CRPA
results in [40–42]. Comparisons between shell model,
RPA and CRPA results were performed in [43, 44]. Phe-
nomenological calculations of cross sections were also pro-
vided, in Refs. [45–47]. In this paper, we present cross
section calculations for low–energy CC and NC neutrino–
nucleus scattering in a HF+CRPA approach, with a focus
on 40Ar.

II. MODEL

We will brieﬂy discuss the model used for our calcula-
tions. The cross section for inclusive electroweak scatter-
ing of neutrinos oﬀ atomic nuclei is given by the familiar
expression:

spectively. These are the well–known Fermi and Gamow–
Teller transition operators. At suﬃciently low energies,
they provide an adequate description of the nucleus’ re-
sponse to an electroweak probe. Because they are re-
sponsible for the largest part of the reaction strength,
the transitions they give rise to are known as ’allowed’,
with the J P quantum numbers of the operators 0+ and
1+, respectively. Conversely, higher–order transitions are
often referred to as ’forbidden’ transitions. As we will
show, the latter are still important at the energies con-
In this paper, the nuclear re-
sidered in this context.
sponses are calculated in a Continuum Random Phase
Approximation (CRPA), where long–range correlations
and collective excitations of the nucleus are taken into
account. We mention that in these calculations, we use
the free-nucleon value for the axial coupling of gA = 1.27,
whereas some models use an eﬀective quenched value of
around gA = 1.00. This issue is discussed in Ref. [49],
where it is argued that the need for such a quenching
may appear as a consequence of an absence of nuclear
correlations or an insuﬃciently large model space in the
modeling.

Within the HF+CRPA approach, excited states of
the nucleus are described as coherent superpositions of
particle–hole and hole–particle excitations out of the cor-
related ground state:

energies,
the HF+CRPA model described above is
also successful at describing the quasielastic region
at higher energies, such as those relevant to baseline
experiments [57–59, 61, 62].

Finally, we turn our attention to the topic of Coulomb
interactions between the outgoing lepton and the residual
nucleus in charged–current interactions. At low energies,
this is expected to have a strong eﬀect on the cross sec-
tion due to the low momentum of the charged outgoing
lepton. In our discussion we will consider two eﬀective
schemes to account for the Coulomb distortion. At low
outgoing lepton energies, of the order of magnitude ap-
plicable to e.g. beta decay, one can make use of the Fermi
function [63]:

ﬁnal nuclear charge Z (cid:48) is equal to Z + 1 or Z
1 for
ν/¯ν, respectively. This approximation assumes that the
outgoing leptons only contribute sizeably as an s–wave to
the reaction strength, and is therefore not applicable at
higher outgoing lepton energies [63]. Therefore, in these
regimes, we will consider a diﬀerent scheme, the modiﬁed
eﬀective momentum approximation (MEMA), detailed in
Ref. [63], where the energy and momentum of the ﬁnal
lepton is shifted to an eﬀective value by the Coulomb
energy in the center of the nucleus:

hand for spatial, spin and isospin coordinates. The resid-
ual interaction used is the same Skyrme force that is em-
ployed to calculate the single–particle wave functions, so
that the scheme is self–consistent. Partially ﬁlled shells
such as those present in 40Ar are dealt with by including
occupation probabilities in the transition amplitudes:

at higher energies, where reaction strength contains in-

III. RESULTS

Before we cover the results for neutrino–argon calcu-
lations, we wish to compare our model predictions with
other recent studies at these energies for various nuclei.
In Fig. 4 we confront the HF+CRPA results for 56Fe to
those of other models. The comparison is ﬁne, except
that the strength lies comparatively low for lower ener-
gies. This is because of the fact that, within the CRPA,
discrete excitations are not taken into account. We can
also take a look at the cross section predictions for DAR
kinematics, by folding this cross section with the appro-
priate neutrino spectrum. We compare this to the KAR-
MEN experimental results and various other theoretical
models in Table I. Our result is compatible with exper-
imental results, but has a lower predicted value than
most other theoretical models. This is due to the fact
that, once again, discrete excitations are not included in
the reaction strength. Finally, we compare the B(GT−)
strength with other models discussed in [36]. Firstly,
this strength, as a function of the nuclear excitation Ex
is shown in Fig. 5. The HF+CRPA results lack the dis-
crete excitation strength, but reproduces the large peak
of the QRPA results relatively well. Secondly, we simi-
larly compare the total strength in Table II. HF+CRPA
underpredicts the other models, likely once again due to
the absence of discrete excitations, but still falls within
the broad experimental error interval.

In Fig. 6 we compare with other model predictions
for argon. A similar comparison holds. The results from
MARLEY match surprisingly well with those from [38],
in spite of using a diﬀerent, Fermi Gas–based RPA model.
The other two models predict lower strength at higher en-

the MEMA. We show this for several nuclei. For 12C, it
is clear that the Fermi function is a good approximation
over the whole energy range, while for 40Ar and 56Fe,
the Fermi function and MEMA schemes cross between
60 and 70 MeV. In general, the heavier the nucleus, the
more limited the Fermi function will be in its area of
applicability. A similar comparison of Coulomb schemes
was performed in Ref. [38].

is argued that this is due to a limited valence space for
excited states at higher energies.

In
comparing the case of CC and NC for neutrinos and
antineutrinos, other than the overall magnitudes of the
cross sections, the qualitative features concerning the
relative contributions from diﬀerent multipolarities are
similar. The 0+ and 1+ transitions correspond with
the allowed approximation. One can appreciate the
non–trivial contributions arising from the forbidden 1−
and 2− transitions in the continuum channels. The
importance of these two in particular was similarly noted
in Ref. [28]. Even higher order multipoles start becoming
visible above 50 MeV. The 0+ reaction strength is negli-
gible for excitations into the continuum. In comparing
the CC and NC result, one notices that the diﬀerence
in strength between neutrinos and antineutrinos is
noticeably larger for the former. A key reason for this is
the Coulomb interaction with the outgoing lepton, which
enhances or decreases the cross section for neutrinos and
antineutrinos, respectively.

Next, we cover the energy dependence of the contribu-
tions of diﬀerent multipole moments. We ﬁrst take a look
at the diﬀerential cross section dσ
dω for 40Ar in Fig. 11 for
several incoming energies. For clarity, we do not show
the 0− and 0+ contributions, since these are small. At
25 MeV incoming energy, we can see that the cross sec-
tion is quite well described in an allowed approximation,

with the diﬀerential cross section almost coinciding with
the 1+ transition strength, except for a small diﬀerence
in the tail. At 50 MeV, this is no longer an adequate ap-
proximation, with signiﬁcant strength coming from the
1− and 2− transitions, aﬀecting the shape of the excita-
tion spectrum as well. Finally, at 75 MeV, even higher
order multipolarities become non-negligible. In Figs. 12
and 13 we investigate the A–dependence of the cross sec-
tions. Comparing Figs. 7 to 12 and 13, one observes that

even for a relatively small nucleus as 12C, forbidden tran-
sitions are non–negligible at higher energies, but not to
nearly the same degree as they are for 40Ar and 56Fe,
both of which show a qualitatively similar picture, not
diﬀering too signiﬁcantly in size. In general, the larger
the target nucleus, the more multipoles will be necessary
for convergence of the cross section.

multipole contributions will have in an experimental con-

each multipole, are shown in Figs. 14, 15 and 16. The
plots demonstrate that for argon nuclei, forbidden transi-
tions can be expected to contribute sizeably to the reac-
tion strength in the energy regimes of DAR neutrinos. All
three paint a qualitatively similar picture in terms of rel-
ative contributions, except for the case of NC (¯νµ, 40Ar),

Fig. 1. Therefore the 2− transition strength has a larger
relative weight. And although small, even the 2+, 3− and
3+ transitions cannot be neglected when high precision is
desired. We conclude that working strictly in an allowed
approximation is not desirable, and forbidden transitions
must be properly accounted for in the modeling of low–
energetic neutrino–nucleus scattering events. Therefore
it is worth noting that the Monte Carlo generator MAR-

LEY [17] employs Fermi and Gamow–Teller transitions
in its modeling of charged–current neutrino–40Ar scatter-

sults, the implementation of forbidden transitions should
be considered important.

IV. SUMMARY

Argon represents an important nuclear scattering tar-
get in low–energy neutrino research. We have presented
calculations for (ν, 40Ar) scattering. We employed a
Hartree Fock + Continuum Random Phase Approxima-
tions (HF+CRPA) framework, which allows us to model
the responses and include the eﬀects of long–range corre-
lations. The Coulomb interaction of the outgoing lepton
is accounted for in an eﬀective way by interpolating be-

lepton momenta, and the Modiﬁed Eﬀective Momentum
Approach (MEMA) at higher ones. Subsequently com-
paring model results for 56Fe nuclei, one notices that the
model predictions compare favorably. Finally, we pre-
sented our predictions for 40Ar, for both neutral and
charged current events, where the important role played
by forbidden transitions is evident. Even in a typical ex-
perimental scenario of a π+ decay–at–rest neutrino spec-
trum, this is still the case, with strong contributions from
