SCATTERING RESONANCES ON TRUNCATED CONES

DEAN BASKIN AND MENGXUAN YANG

Abstract. We consider the problem of ﬁnding the resonances of the Laplacian on truncated
Riemannian cones. In a similar fashion to Cheeger–Taylor, we construct the resolvent and
scattering matrix for the Laplacian on cones and truncated cones. Following Stefanov, we
show that the resonances on the truncated cone are distributed asymptotically as Arn +
o(rn), where A is an explicit coeﬃcient. We also conclude that the Laplacian on a non-
truncated cone has no resonances.

1. Introduction

−

In this note, we consider the resonances on truncated Riemannian cones and establish
a Weyl-type formula for their distribution. To ﬁx notation, we let (Y, h) be a compact
1)-dimensional Riemannian manifold (with or without boundary) and let C(Y ) denote
(n
the cone over Y . In other words, C(Y ) is diﬀeomorphic to the product (0,
Y and is
equipped with the incomplete Riemannian metric g = dr2 + r2h. We refer the reader to the
foundational work of Cheeger–Taylor [4, 5] for more details on the geometric set-up. We
also introduce the truncated Riemannian cone Ca(Y ) formed by introducing a boundary at
r = a, i.e., Ca(Y ) is diﬀeomorphic to [a,

where ∆h denotes the Laplacian of (Y, h). Its resolvent R(λ) is given by

R(λ) = (∆ + λ2)−1.

We consider the cutoﬀ resolvent χR(λ)χ, where χ is a (ﬁxed) smooth compactly supported
function on C(Y ) (or Ca(Y )). One consequence of the resolvent formula of Theorem 2.1 is
that the cutoﬀ resolvent extends meromorphically to the logarithmic cover of C

More precisely, we identify elements λ of the logarithmic cover of C

The poles of the cutoﬀ resolvent consist of possibly ﬁnitely many L2-eigenvalues lying in
the upper half-plane (which do not appear with Dirichlet boundary conditions) and poles
lying on other sheets of the cover. The latter poles are called the resonances of ∆.

The main theorem of this paper counts the most physically relevant resonances for the
truncated cone. In particular, we count those resonances λ nearest to the physical half-plane,
(π, 3π
i.e., those with arg λ

cover remain more mysterious and are related to the zeros of Hankel functions near the real
axis. We consider the resonance counting function on these sheets, deﬁned by

The following theorem provides an asymptotic formula for N(r).
Theorem 1.1. Suppose either that the set of periodic geodesics of (Y, h) has Liouville mea-
sure zero or that Y = Sn−1 equipped with a constant rescaling of the standard metric. Con-
sider the truncated cone C1(Y ) equipped with the Dirichlet Laplacian and let N(r) denote its
resonance counting function on the neighboring sheets as above. We then have, as r
,

N(r) = An Vol(Y, h)rn + o(rn),
where An is an explicit constant (deﬁned below in equation (7)) and Vol(Y, h) denotes the
volume of the Riemannian manifold (Y, h).

→ ∞

The constant An Vol(Y, h) in Theorem 1.1 is the same constant as computed by Ste-
fanov [11] for the resonance counting function on the domain exterior to a ball in Rn. When
Y = Sn−1 is equipped with its standard metric, the truncated cone C1(Y ) can can be thought
of as the exterior of the unit ball in Euclidean space. Theorem 1.1 recovers Stefanov’s result.
(When Y = Sn−1, n odd, is equipped with its standard metric, the cutoﬀ resolvent in fact
continues to the complex plane; this can be seen in the resolvent formulae below.)

We also state the following theorem, which is known to the community but does not seem

to be in the literature.
Theorem 1.2. If (Y, h) is a compact Riemannian manifold (with or without boundary) then
the cone C(Y ) has no resonances.

In fact, Theorem 2.1 below shows that λ is a resonance of the truncated cone C1(Y ) if
and only if λ/a is a resonance of the truncated cone Ca(Y ). Sending a to 0 then pushes all
resonances out to inﬁnity and provides evidence for Theorem 1.2.

The proof of Theorem 1.1 has two main steps. We ﬁrst separate variables and obtain an
explicit resolvent formula in Theorem 2.1 to characterize the resonances as zeros of a Hankel
function. In Section 3 we consider the asymptotic distribution of the zeros of each Hankel
function appearing in the resolvent formula. The hypothesis on the link (Y, h) is used to
control the error terms when synthesizing the result. Theorem 1.2 is an immediate corollary
of the resolvent formula in Theorem 2.1.

The proof of Theorem 1.1 follows an argument of Stefanov [11] very closely. Stefanov
established a Weyl-type law for the distribution of resonances for the exterior of a ball in
odd-dimensional Euclidean space. The main contribution of this paper is the observation
that, after some natural modiﬁcations, the core of Stefanov’s argument applies to the setting
of cones. Borthwick [1, 2] and Borthwick–Philipp [3] showed that a similar approach works
in the asymptotically hyperbolic setting.

We further remark that we have specialized to the Dirichlet Laplacian in Theorem 1.1
only for simplicity. For Neumann or Robin boundary conditions, the resolvent formula of
Theorem 2.1 has an analogous expression. The resonance counting problem then involves
counting zeros of H (2)′

ν , which can be handled with similar arguments.

ν + CνH (2)

2. Resolvent construction

In this section we write down an explicit formula (via separation of variables) for the
resolvent and then show that the cut-oﬀ resolvent has a meromorphic continuation to the
logarithmic cover Λ of the complex plane. The construction is essentially contained in the
work of Cheeger–Taylor [4, 5], but the resolvent is not explicitly written there.

In this section, we prove the following explicit formula for the j-th piece of the resolvent.
For the cone C(Y ) (i.e., for a = 0), we use the Friedrichs extension of the Laplacian to
guarantee self-adjointness (though in high enough dimension the Laplacian is essentially
self-adjoint):
Theorem 2.1. The piece of the resolvent corresponding to the j-th eigenvalue has the fol-
lowing explicit expression on the truncated cone Ca(Y ) or the cone C(Y ) (a = 0):

We now proceed by the standard ODE technique of variation of parameters. One basis for

where Jν is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind and H (1)

For

λ > 0, Rj(λ)fj must lie in L2((a,

), rn−1 dr). If fj is compactly supported, this
means that uj = Rj(λ)fj must be a multiple of r−(n−2)/2H (1)
νj (λr) near inﬁnity. When a > 0,
uj must satisfy the boundary condition at r = a. When a = 0, the choice of the Friedrichs
extension requires that both uj and u′
j lie in the the weighted L2 space near 0 and so uj must
be a multiple of r−(n−2)/2Jνj (λr) near r = 0 as any nonzero multiple of w2 will not have this
property.

the Wronskian of the Bessel and Hankel functions and seen to be

This sequence is absolutely summable, so the partial sums of the series in equation (4)
converge locally uniformly. This establishes that the cut-oﬀ resolvent on the full cone (a = 0)
meromorphically extends to the logarithmic cover Λ of the complex plane.

We now proceed to the case of the truncated cone (a > 0). We proceed by an appeal to

the analytic Fredholm theorem.

C ∞((a,

Fix χ0, χ∞ ∈

near r = a, and χ0 + χ∞ = 1. We let R∞(λ) denote the resolvent on the non-truncated
cone and R0(λ) denote the resolvent on a compact manifold with boundary into which the
support of χ0 embeds isometrically. We deﬁne the parametrix

∞

Q(λ) = ˜χ0R0(λ)χ0 + ˜χ∞R∞(λ)χ∞,

where ˜χ have similar support properties and are identically 1 on the support of their counter-
parts. Applying ∆ + λ2 yields a remainder of the form I +
[∆, ˜χi]Ri(λ)χi. Both terms are
λ by Neumann series, so applying Ra(λ) to
compact and the operator is invertible for large
both sides and inverting the remainder shows that it has a meromorphic continuation. (cid:3)

3. Proof of Theorem 1.1

By the formula for the resolvent in Theorem 2.1, the resonances of Ra(λ) correspond to
those λ for which H (1)
νj (λa) = 0 for some j. For simplicity we will discuss only the case a = 1
as the other cases can be found by rescaling. As mentioned in the introduction, we consider
only those resonances nearest to the upper half-plane, i.e., those with

Because the resonances correspond to zeros of H (2)

νj , we must also consider the asymptotic
distribution of the νj. In what follows, we consider only the case when the periodic geodesics
of (Y, h) have measure zero.1 The eigenvalues µ2

j of ∆h obey Weyl’s law:

µj : µj ≤

Here Vol(Bn−1) denotes the volume of the unit ball in Rn−1 and Vol(Y, h) is the volume
of Y equipped with the metric h. In general, R(µ) = O(µn−2), but if we now impose the
dynamical hypothesis (that the set of periodic geodesics of (Y, h) has Liouville measure zero),
then a theorem of Duistermaat–Guillemin [7] (in the boundaryless case) and Ivrii [8, 9] (in
the boundary case) shows that

R(λ) = o(µn−2).

1When (Y, h) is a sphere, the analysis is simpliﬁed slightly. In that case, one replaces the use of the Weyl

formula with explicit formulae for the eigenvalues µ2

j and their multiplicities.

By our improved Weyl’s law (9), the second term is O(rn−2).

Again by Weyl’s law, we observe that the second term is O(rn−2). By relating ∆t and ∆kν
we can rewrite the ﬁrst term:

By Weyl’s law (9), the second term is O(rn−1), so we again consider the ﬁrst term.

Here the prefactor of 2 disappeared because the ﬁrst integral parametrizes only half of ∂K+.
It reappears in the statement of Theorem 1.1 because each zero here corresponds to two
resonances (one on each sheet). We further observe that the constant An Vol(Y, h) agrees
with the leading term found in the Euclidean case found by Stefanov [11].

Sending ǫ to 0 establishes the theorem for the approximate zeros λν,k. Because each λν,k

is in a C/ν neighborhood of a zero hν,k, this ﬁnishes the proof of the theorem.
