Abstract

We establish an approach to compute linear-response functions to elucidate heat waves and non-local thermal

transport. The theory is able to describe the response of a system to external heat sources that are nonuniform

in space and time. The response functions are computed using equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations

of an Ar crystal modeled using the standard Lennard-Jones potential. It is shown that for low temperatures

and short length scales, transport can be partially or even completely ballistic, with the response primarily

limited by the group velocity of lattice waves. By contrast, at longer length scales and higher temperatures,

the response functions correspond more closely to diﬀusive transport characteristic of Fourier’s law. It is also

shown how the eﬀective thermal conductivity can be determined in a partially-ballistic regime. The results

demonstrate the known reduction in the eﬀective thermal conductivity observed when system dimensions

are smaller than the mean-free path for lattice waves. Finally, we show how determination of the relevant

response functions can be used to model heating of a crystal without requiring additional atomic-scale

simulations. Diﬀerences between computed results and predictions from Fourier’s law represent wave-like,

partially-ballistic transport.

1. Introduction

Thermal conduction is most often described using Fourier’s law. Speciﬁcally, the Cartesian components

of the heat-ﬂux density ~J are related to the temperature gradient ~∇T using,

Jµ = −

κµν

∂T
∂xν

(1)

ν
X
in which Jµ is a component of the heat-ﬂux density, xν is a component of the position vector ~x, and κµν is an

element of the thermal conductivity tensor. An important assumption of Eq. 1 is that the heat-ﬂux density

depends only on the local temperature gradient at a single instant of time. For Fourier’s law to accurately

describe transport, the separation between any heat sources and sinks must be large enough that transport

is diﬀusive. In many instances this is a good assumption, but in nanoscale devices is often not the case [1, 2].

Speciﬁcally, if the separation between a heat source and sink is comparable or less than the mean-free path Λ

of heat carriers, then transport will be at least partially ballistic and transport will deviate signiﬁcantly from

the predictions based on Eq. 1. Moreover, when the heat sources and sinks depend on time, heat transport

should be limited by the group velocity of lattice waves. This feature, which is particularly relevant for

partially-ballistic transport, is not captured by Fourier’s law.

It is clear that transport phenomena in a

partially-ballistic regime requires a nonlocal theory.

Partially-ballistic transport has been directly observed in “direct” molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations

which use a heat source and sink and compute the steady-state temperature gradient. It is then assumed that

Fourier’s law can be applied to the results, with the computed eﬀective thermal conductivity κef f generally

diﬀering, often substantially, from the actual bulk thermal conductivity κ. Speciﬁcally, it was shown in

Ref.

[3] that MD simulation yields a linear dependency of

L where L is the separation between
the heat source and sink. Over the past severals years, improved insight and more accurate calculations

have demonstrated that the linear dependence assumed in Ref. [3] is overly simplistic. This is understood

to be due to the fact that scattering rates of vibrational modes depend rather strongly on wavelength [4].

Partially-ballistic transport also results in nonlinear temperature proﬁles [5]. In Ref. [5] a nonlocal theory

for thermal conduction was developed to probe partially-ballistic eﬀects. Speciﬁcally, a non-local function

κ(~x, ~x′) was used to relate the temperature proﬁle in an MD calculation to the heat-current density via the

expression,

Jµ(~x, t) = −

κ(~x, ~x′)

Z

∂T (~x′)
∂x′

(2)

This theory was used in reciprocal space to describe results of extensive MD calculations using the direct

method for conduction in GaN [6], with the assumption that for an ideal periodic system κ(~x, ~x′) = κ(~x−~x′),
the Fourier-transformed response ˜κ(~k) was directly obtained. The dependence ˜κ(~k) on the magnitude |~k|

was interpreted by solving the Peierls-Boltzmann Equation (PBE) with diﬀerent models for the dependence

of scattering time on phonon wave vector. Solutions were obtained within the relaxation-time approximation

(RTA) and very good agreement with MD results was demonstrated [5]. An important result of this approach

was that insight into how scattering rates depend on phonon wave vector was obtained. Moreover, the

approach developed in Ref.

[5] demonstrates a way to extract and understand nanoscale transport eﬀects

from an MD simulation.

Another simulation approach for obtaining thermal transport properties is to use equilibrium MD simu-

lation and the Green-Kubo (GK) formulation of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem[7, 8]. Speciﬁcally, the

thermal conductivity of a system in equilibrium at temperature T can be computed using,

κµν =

Ω
kBT 2

Z

hJµ(τ )Jν (0)idτ

(3)

in which Ω is the system volume. Generally, predictions for κ obtained with Eq. 3 do not agree with direct-

method calculations due to partially-ballistic transport in the latter case. Hence, it is generally believed that

the Green-Kubo approach is more appropriate for determining bulk transport properties. To the best of our

knowledge, Green-Kubo methods have not previously been used to extract nonlocal transport properties.

2

The theory of nonlocal thermal conductivity was ﬁrst developed in Ref.

[9]. In this paper we consider
the response function for the heat-ﬂux density ~J(~x, t) which results from an heat pulse which is added at

time t′. The heat pulse results in a local deviation ∆u(ext)(~x′, t′) from the equilibrium energy density. The

heat-ﬂux density after the heat pulse (i.e. for times t > t′) is given by the expression,

Jµ(~x, t) = −

CV ZΩ

ν
X

Kµν(~x − ~x′, t − t′)

∂∆u(ext)(~x′, t′)
∂x′

d3x′

(4)

in which CV is the heat capacity of the volume Ω, and the gradient of the energy pulse is taken because

only a nonuniform pulse will result in heat ﬂow. The primary objective of this paper is to establish how

equilibrium MD simulations can be used to determine the nonlocal response function Kµν (~x − ~x′, t − t′). We

also note the assumption of linearity in Eq. 4, which is also used in Appendix A to detail the response to a

series of external heat pulses.

The approach taken is to recast Eq. 4 in reciprocal space. We consider a Fourier expansion of the heat-

ﬂux density and the energy deviation. In a periodic system, the nonlocal response function Kµν(~x − ~x′, t − t′)

can also be written as a Fourier series expansion. After integration over the volume Ω, the response can be
written for any wave vector ~k as,

˜Jµ(~k, t) = −

i
cV

ν
X

kν ˜Kµν(~k, t − t′)˜u(ext)(~k, t′)

(5)

in which cV is the volumetric heat capacity cV = CV
Ω . In this paper, Eq. 5 will be the starting point for
deriving the expression used to determine ˜Kµν(~k, t − t′) from an equilibrium MD simulation. This expression
can also be written in terms of the temperature deviation also deﬁned in reciprocal space ∆ ˜T (ext)(~k, t′),

˜Jµ(~k, t) = −i

kν ˜Kµν(~k, t − t′)∆ ˜T (ext)(~k, t′)

(6)

It should be noted that these expressions are in the spirit of the original Kubo paper[7] in that the objective

is to determine the response of a system to an external perturbation. However, in Ref. [7] this is a mechanical

perturbation rather than that due to an external heat source. We will discuss this diﬀerence in the next

section.

It is important to note a diﬀerence between Eq. 2 and Eq. 4. In addition to the time-dependence implied

in Eq. 4, a key distinction is that Eq. 4 describes the response to an external heat source. By contrast, Eq.

2 describes a static situation where the external heat sources and sinks are not described, even though they

must exist to maintain a static temperature gradient. Therefore, it is important to note that the response

function Kµν(~x − ~x′, t − t′) is not directly comparable to the nonlocal function κ(~x, ~x′) in Eq. 2. In fact,

they describe rather diﬀerent things. In the ﬁnal section of the paper, we return to address some diﬀerences

in these two descriptions of nonlocal transport phenomena.

In the next section, the expressions required for the determination of the nonlocal response function are

derived. For a reference point, the same response functions are also determined from Fourier’s law. These

expressions are essentially analogous to the correlation functions used in a Green-Kubo calculation of the

3

thermal conductivity via Eq. 3. This is followed by MD simulations results. It is shown how the response

functions diﬀer from those obtained using Fourier’s law. The results show that transport is limited by the

wave-propagation velocity, and moreover that for low temperatures and short length scales, transport is

partially-ballistic.

2. Linear-response theoretical expressions for non-local heat transport

Before investigating the non-local response functions, it is helpful to determine the comparable response

function from Fourier’s law. This is obtained from the well-known Green’s function for the heat diﬀusion

equation given here in reciprocal space. For simplicity, we consider an isotropic system with thermal con-

ductivity κ. We consider the evolution of a temperature deviation ∆T (~x, t). The thermal-diﬀusion equation

is,

∂∆T (~x, t)
∂t

= α∇2∆T (~x, t)

(7)

in which α = κ
cV

is the thermal diﬀusivity. Writing this in reciprocal space, and assuming that the initial

temperature deviation is due to an external heat source acting at time t = 0, we obtain the equation for the

temperature deviation for times after the pulse t > 0,

∆ ˜T (~k, t) = e−αk

2

t∆ ˜T (ext)(~k, 0)

(8)

Here ˜T (ext)(~k, 0) is due to some external heat source which generates a temperature deviation to a system
initially in equilibrium at time t = 0. Then ∆ ˜T (~k, t) represents the resulting temperature deviation for

subsequent times. Moreover, the µth component of the heat-ﬂux density is given by,

˜Jµ(~k, t) = −ikµκe−αk

2

t∆ ˜T (ext)(~k, 0)

(9)

We will only consider systems with cubic symmetry, such that the heat-ﬂux density is directed along ~k, and

hence we can deﬁne,

in which k = |~k|. Then we can write,

˜Jµ(~k, t) = ˜J(~k, t)

kµ
k

˜J(~k, t) = −ikκe−αk

2

t∆ ˜T (ext)(~k, 0)

(10)

(11)

In this case the response is also homogenous, and we can identify the response from Fourier’s law by com-

parison to Eq. 6,

˜K(~k, t) = κe−αk

2

t

(12)

This shows that from Fourier’s law, an external heat pulse with wave-vector ~k results in a heat-ﬂux density

exponentially decays with a characteristic time

αk2 . Also, because the heat-diﬀusion equation is linear, the
response to a series of heat pulses is easily determined using superposition. To model the response to a series

of heat pulses, it will be useful to consider the Fourier transform,

We now turn to the nonlocal response function. To determine a computational approach using MD

simulations, we note that the method in the original Kubo paper[7] requires a mechanical perturbation

which is added to the Hamiltonian. The added term generates a deviation from equilibrium distribution

function. However, it is assumed that the eﬀect is small enough so that the system evolves under the action

of the original Hamiltonian without the perturbation. It is then clear that determining how ﬂuctuations in

dynamical variables are dissipated within the equilibrium ensemble can be used to determine how the system

responds to an external perturbation.

The case of thermal disturbances generates a conceptual diﬃculty which has been noted by others includ-

ing by Kubo himself[10]. Namely, there is no unambiguous way to include a purely thermal disturbance as a

perturbation to the Hamiltonian. Therefore, one encounters immediately a diﬃculty in attempting to gen-

eralize the approach from Ref. [7] to derive linear-response functions for thermal transport and many other

phenomena. The work by Kubo in Ref. [10] demonstrates the way forward based on Onsager’s generalized

reciprocity law[11, 12], which essentially states that any ﬂuctuation in the equilibrium ensemble will decay

in time. For a system with some set of macroscopic variables αj, it is assumed there is a linear relationship

between the thermodynamic driving force and the time derivative of the macroscopic variables. Speciﬁcally

the evolution is governed by the equation[10] ,

˙αj =

Gjl

Xl

∂S
∂αl (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(14)

in which S represents the entropy function and hence T ∂S
∂αl

is a thermodynamic driving force. The objective

of Ref. [10] is to compute the kinetic coeﬃcients Gjl, and to do this one multiplies Eq. 14 by αm to obtain,

Gjm = −

1
kB

h ˙αjαmi

(15)

in which the angle brackets represent an equilibrium average. From this point, a Kubo expression for the

kinetic coeﬃcients is obtained, and hence the calculation for thermal conductivity κ via Eq. 3 can be demon-

strated. In its essential aspects, this approach has been used by Helfand [13] for thermal conductivity, with

detailed derivations in textbooks [14, 15]. It should be noted that there has been at least one attempt[16] to

derive the Green-Kubo expression for thermal conductivity using a mechanical perturbation which “couples”

to the temperature deviation, and thereby obtain a term which can be added to the Hamiltonian so that the

procedure in Ref. [7] might be followed. However, it is unclear to us exactly why the mechanical perturba-

tion, which is taken to be the Hamiltonian density, should not itself reﬂect the temperature deviation. At any

rate, Ref. [16] demonstrates their approach yields the same Green-Kubo expression for thermal conductivity.

Here we do not consider this approach further, but rather use an approach similar to Refs. [10, 13, 14, 15].

The starting point we take is given in Eq. 5. Because we will consider a cubic system, we can assume

transport is homogenous. Hence we can take, with the heat pulse input at t′ = 0,

˜J(~k, t) = −

i
cV

k ˜K(~k, t)˜u(ext)(~k, 0)

(16)

We next assume that we can determine the response to an external perturbation through a determination

of how ﬂuctuations are dissipated in the equilibrium ensemble, thereby following the general prescription by

Kubo[10]. Thus, while the response function will be used to describe the eﬀect of an external heat source,

the function itself will be determined using equilibrium MD simulation. We rewrite Eq. 16 to describe the
dissipation of an instantaneous ﬂuctuation ˜u(~k, 0),

We then multiply both sides of Eq. A2 by ik˜u(−~k, 0) and take an equilibrium ensemble average of both sides

˜J(~k, t) = −

i
cV

k ˜K(~k, t)˜u(~k, 0)

(17)

of the equation, leading to,

ikh ˜J(~k, t)˜u(−~k, 0)i =

1
cV

k2 ˜K(~k, t)h˜u(~k, 0)˜u(−~k, 0)i

(18)

Next we take a derivative with respect to t on both sides and use the continuity equation and time-reversal

symmetry. Speciﬁcally, we make use of the relation [10],

h ˜J(~k, t)˜u(−~k, 0)i = h ˜J(~k, 0)˜u(−~k, −t)i

Then taking a derivative with respect to t, we ﬁnally obtain,

∂ ˜K(~k, t)
∂t

= cV

h ˜J(~k, t) ˜J(−~k, 0)i
h˜u(~k, 0)˜u(−~k, 0)i

To obtain an expression for the response function ˜K(~k, τ ), the equation above is integrated,

˜K(~k, τ ) − ˜K(~k, 0) = cV

τ

0 h ˜J (~k, t) ˜J(−~k, 0)idt
h˜u(~k, 0)˜u(−~k, 0)i
R

(19)

(20)

(21)

It is evident that the response function should vanish in the limit τ → ∞. In addition, ˜K(~k, 0) is also equal

to zero. This point is very clear on general terms, but it is also proven in the simulation results since the

integral on the right-hand side of Eq. 21 is shown to be zero in the limit τ → ∞. Hence the ﬁnal quantity

we obtain is the response function,

˜K(~k, τ ) = cV

τ

0 h ˜J(~k, t) ˜J (−~k, 0)idt
h˜u(~k, 0)˜u(−~k, 0)i
R

(22)

This quantity, which can be readily computed by equilibrium MD simulation, governs how a system responds

to externally-applied heat pulses. To establish deviations from Fourier’s law, calculations based on Eq. 22

should be compared to the same quantity in Eq. 12 determined using the heat-diﬀusion equation. For the

denominator in Eq. 22, we note that in the long-wavelength limit, the average in the canonical ensemble

yields the ﬂuctuation formula for the volumetric heat capacity,

h˜u(~k, 0)˜u(−~k, 0)i =

lim
~k→0

cV kBT 2
Ω

(23)

However, in the calculations reported here, the constant energy ensemble is used, and the values are de-
termined for ﬁnite ~k values. Hence, the term h˜u(~k, 0)˜u(−~k, 0)i was computed by time-averaging of the MD

simulation results.

6

This section concludes with the Fourier transform,

˜KT (~k, ω) =

∞

0
Z

˜K(~k, τ )eiωτ dτ

(24)

The choice of the integration limits accounts for the fact that the response is causal, and hence the response
function vanishes for τ ≤ 0. The expression for ˜KT (~k, ω) can be directly compared to the result obtained

above for Fourier’s law in Eq. 13. Diﬀerences are expected to be due to nonlocal transport phenomena

and “wave-like” heat transport in MD simulations, in contrast to the purely diﬀusive behavior predicted by

Fourier’s law.

Finally, it should be noted that ˜K(~k, τ ) is real, and hence ˜K(~k, τ ) = ˜K(−~k, τ ).

It then follows that
T (~k, ω) = ˜KT (~k, −ω). In the next section, we report
the approach and results for computing the response functions. These are compared to those which result

˜KT (~k, ω) is complex and should satisfy the relation ˜K ∗

from Fourier’s law so that the nonlocal nature of the transport can be identiﬁed.

3. Computational approach

The simulation results were obtained using a Lennard-Jones (LJ) solid in an fcc lattice. Periodic-boundary

conditions were applied in all three directions. Although the results could be given in terms of reduced units,

we used LJ parameters applicable to the model for LJ argon. The pair-potential was determined from,

(cid:21)

(cid:17)

(25)

(cid:20)(cid:16)

. A smooth cutoﬀ at a distance rc = 3σ was used.

Speciﬁcally, the pair potential umod(r) given by,

umod(r) = u(r) − u(r = rc) −

du
dr

(cid:20)

(cid:21)r=rc

(r − rc)

(26)

was used in the calculations for r ≤ rc. For r > rc, the pair potential is taken to be zero. It is easily seen

that the above expression yields umod(r = rc) = 0, and moreover the force obtained is also zero at r = rc.

Finally, the atomic mass was taken to be m = 39.948 in atomic-mass units.

The heat-ﬂux density is deﬁned using the standard expression relevant for a pair potential (e.g. see Ref.

[3] and Ref.

[17] for a quantum version). Here we distinguish the contribution to the heat-ﬂux density

assigned locally to a speciﬁc atom. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne a component of the heat-ﬂux density associated

with atom i as,

Ji,µ(t) =

1
Ω 

vi,µ (ǫi − hhi) +

1
2

rij,µ

~Fij · ~vi

Xj6=i

(cid:16)

(cid:17)



(27)

in which vi,µ is the µth component of the velocity ~vi, rij,µ is the µth component of the vector ~rij = ~ri − ~rj,
and ~Fij is the pairwise force due to the interaction between atoms i and j. The energy ǫi is the sum of



the potential and kinetic energies, with the potential energy for each pair evenly divided between the two

atoms [3]. The quantity hhi is the average enthalpy per particle, which for a single-component system with

7

N particles is given by hhi = hHi/N , where H is the total system enthalpy. This particular deﬁnition with

the average enthalpy term subtracted is speciﬁcally referred to as the reduced heat-ﬂux density [18]. The

quantity in Eq. 6 can be obtained from the above expression by localizing the heat ﬂux at the site of each

atom, hence,

These deﬁnitions are consistent with those derived in Ref. [18]. The the Fourier components are given by,

For ~k = 0, this reduces to the standard expression of the heat-ﬂux density used in Green-Kubo calculations
of the thermal conductivity[3]. As mentioned previously, the wave vectors ~k should be chosen to be reciprocal

lattice vectors of the simulation supercell, which means that in evaluation of the fourier-transformed heat-ﬂux

density does not require any “minimum image” convention to be applied.

Two diﬀerent simulation supercells were used to compute response functions. The small supercell con-

tained N = 4608 atoms and was orthorhombic with dimensions 3.24nm ×3.24 nm ×17.3nm. The large

supercell was also orthorhombic with N = 9216 atoms and dimensions 3.24nm ×3.24 nm ×34.5nm. Both

supercells correspond to placing the atoms at a nearest neighbor distance 21/6σ which corresponds to the

minimum of the LJ potential. The larger supercell dimensions were chosen to probe nonlocal transport

eﬀects over longer wavelengths while still maintaining manageable computational costs.

The equations of motion were integrated using the velocity Verlet algorithm with MD timestep of ∆t =

2.152fs. Each run was preceded by at least 2.5 × 104 MD steps using a constant temperature algorithm,

followed by a much longer run to sample the constant energy ensemble. For T = 12K and T = 72K using

the small supercell, 10 independent simulations were performed with a total simulation time of 5.358ns

for averaging. For the large supercell, 30 independent calculations at T = 12K were performed with a

total simulation time 11.384ns. For simulations at 72K in the large supercell, very slow timescales for the

response function required longer averaging times. In this case, 40 independent simulations were performed

with a total simulation time of 16.677ns. Error bars for the response functions and Green-Kubo thermal

conductivity were determined from analysis of the statistics of the independent runs.

It should be noted that the simulations are entirely classical, and substantially below the Debye temper-

ature of solid Ar of approximately 80K. However, it has generally been believed that classical simulations

can provide insight below the Debye temperature since the most important long-wavelength phonons are de-

scribed correctly. Generally it is accepted that classical simulations have some validity above the maximum

thermal conductivity near 6K in solid Ar [19]. Hence we restrict our calculations to above 10K

8

4. Results

Before computing the response functions, this section begins with the standard Green-Kubo thermal

conductivity κ. In Fig. 1, we plot κ(τ ) as a function of the upper limit of integration τ from,

κ(τ ) =

Ω
kBT 2

τ

0
Z

h ˜J(0, τ ) ˜J (0, 0)idτ

(30)

Formally, the thermal conductivity is equal to the integral in Eq. 30 when the integration limit is taken to

inﬁnity. These results provide a solid connection to previous simulation studies of the thermal conductivity

of solid Ar.

The results for κ(τ ) obtained with Eq. 30 in Fig. 1 are plotted for the the supercell with N = 4608

atoms at T = 12K. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that τ ≈ 40ps appears to be an adequate integration time

to obtain the value of κ, resulting in κ = 1.778W m−1K −1. A longer integration limit τ result in values

κ ≈ 2W m−1K −1 but with signiﬁcantly larger error bars. For T = 72K, the value κ = 0.338W m−1K −1 was

obtained, again using the integration limit τ = 40ps. Computed thermal conductivity values for LJ solids and

liquids have been reported elsewhere[20, 19, 21, 22]. We note that our results are comparable in magnitude

to these previous works, but exhibit some diﬀerences primarily due to diﬀerences in the volume per atom

and hence the pressure. Speciﬁcally, in each of the calculations reported here, the lattice parameter was

chosen to be a = 22/3σ, which corresponds to the nearest-neighbor distance exactly at the minimum of the

LJ potential, speciﬁcally 21/6σ. By contrast, previous studies have generally chosen the lattice parameter

such that the pressure was zero, p = 0. These diﬀerences result in somewhat lower values for κ at low

temperatures, but actually higher values of κ for high temperatures. It has been veriﬁed in earlier studies

that κ is extremely sensitive to the choice of lattice parameter [19, 21].

The computed values of κ can be used within the context of the kinetic theory of heat transport to

determine values for the mean free path Λ. In particular, we assume that Λ = 3κ
CV vs

. For lengths L ∼ Λ

and below, it should be expected that the Fourier theory breaks down. From the calculated values of the

bulk modulus and the mass density, the sound velocity was determined to be vs = 1110ms−1. At the
lowest temperature simulated here with κ = 1.778W m−1K −1, this expression yields Λ ≈ 4.5nm, which is

comparable to the cell dimension L = 17.3nm. This suggests that at least some of the simulation results
described below for ﬁnite ~k should correspond to at least partially-ballistic transport.

It has also been

previously reported that Λ tends to depend strongly on mode frequency and wavelength[4]. It is likely the

case then that at low temperature many modes have a mean free path Λ larger than the simulation supercell.

We next turn to the response functions given in Eq. 22 and Eq. 24, which represent the main focus of

this work. We ﬁrst analyze the response functions obtained for the small system with N = 4608 particles.

In Fig. 2, the real part of the response from Eq. 22 for T = 12K is shown as a function of time τ for a
few diﬀerent wave vectors ~k. In particular we consider only nonzero components along the long direction

of the supercell from kz = 2π

L . Some important features emerge. First, as
established from the expression in Eq. 22, the response function is zero for τ = 0. This reﬂects the fact

L to the largest value kz = 8π

9

that the response to any input heat pulse is not instantaneous. In fact, the rise time in Fig. 2 to reach the

maximum in the response function is characteristic of the period of a longitudinal acoustic (LA) vibration.

Assuming linear dispersion, which should be approximately true in the long-wavelength limit, this implies

for the longest wavelength λ = L = 17.3nm a vibrational period τ ≈ 15.6ps. In fact, the maximum response

for k = 2π

L in Fig. 2 occurs at about τ = 6.9ps which is close to half of this vibrational period. Moreover, the
response is quite small beyond ∼ 16ps, indicating that any perturbation is dissipated in a time comparable

to the vibrational period. For shorter wavelengths, the response is faster and the time required for the

response function to become zero is also shorter. In fact, the times required to reach a maximum are all

consistent with half a vibrational period for the relevant LA vibrational mode. These facts demonstrate that

for T = 12K, transport over length scales L ≤ 17.3nm, transport is almost completely ballistic and hence

not described by Fourier’s law.

In contrast to the ballistic behavior seen in Fig. 2 at T = 12K, at T = 72K diﬀusive behavior begins
to emerge. The results in Fig. 3 show ˜K(k, τ ) from simulations at T = 72K. In each case, the rise time

is comparable to the T = 12K results in Fig. 2. However, especially in the case kz = 2π

error. For comparison, both Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the response functions corresponding to Fourier’s theory

determined by Eq. 13 with κ = 1.778W m−1K −1. Diﬀerences between the computed nonlocal response

functions and the Fourier theory demonstrate the ballistic nature of the transport. Interestingly, the results

show negative values away from the central peak at ω = 0, which appear to be primarily due to the ﬁnite

rise time of the response function. The same quantities are shown for T = 72K with kz = 2π
L in Fig. 6 and
Fig. 7. The comparison between the Fourier theory obtained with κ = 0.338W m−1K −1 and the nonlocal

response functions show relatively small diﬀerences, indicating that transport at this higher temperature is

more diﬀusive in nature. The largest diﬀerences between the nonlocal response and Fourier’s law are evident

near ω = 0.

The results for the larger simulation cell with length L = 34.5nm and N = 9216 particles show that

ballistic behavior persists for T = 12K, but the response is even more clearly diﬀusive at T = 72K in

the long wavelength case kz = 2π

for the very low temperature T = 12K, partially ballistic behavior persists up to L = 34.5nm. By contrast,

10

at T = 72K, the results in Fig. 8 appear quite diﬀusive, with nearly 300ps of time required to dissipate the

initial ﬂuctuation. Comparison of Fig. 3 and Fig. 8, both for T = 72K but diﬀerent system sizes, show that

the dissipation time approximately scales as ∼ L2 which corresponds to diﬀusive behavior.

In Fig. 9-10 the real and imaginary parts of ˜KT (~k, ω) are shown for T = 72K with L = 34.5nm and

N = 9216 particles. Comparison the response function obtained from Fourier’s law demonstrates relatively

good agreement, indicating the Fourier’s law becomes more suitable at longer length scales and higher

temperatures. Hence, the behavior in this case, in agreement with the results in Fig. 8, is more closely

associated with diﬀusive rather than ballistic transport.

Given the response function ˜KT (~k, ω), the temperature proﬁle can be computed as a response to any

external heat source. The details of the calculations are given in Appendix A both for any general response
function ˜KT (~k, ω) and speciﬁcally for Fourier’s law. Here we speciﬁcally consider the response to a very

simple sinusoidal heat source given by,

H (ext)(~x, t′) =

Here we will consider ~k = 2π

L ˆz, where L is the system length along the long direction of the MD simulations
described above. For this length, as noted previously, partially-ballistic results are seen at low temperatures,

(cid:17)

whereas the behavior becomes more consistent with Fourier’s law at higher temperatures. The temperature
proﬁles are given by Eq. A5 in Appendix A when ˜KT (~k, ω) is obtained from the MD simulations for the

small system. For the behavior given by Fourier’s law, the temperature proﬁle is described by Eq. A8 also

in Appendix A.

The results of this comparison are shown in Figs. 11-13 for an external source with frequency ω

2π =
0.012THz at the average temperature T = 12K. It is assumed in these calculations that the source has been

active for a very long period of time so that any transient phenomena can be neglected. For the heating rate

we chose a value aΩ = 18.1nW which results in small enough temperature deviations to assume that the

linear-response theory applies. Note that because of the form of the external source in Eq. 31, the external

source does not change the overall average system temperature.

In Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, temperature proﬁles T (z, t) are shown for the nonlocal theory and Fourier’s

law assuming κ = 1.778W m−1K −1 corresponding to the average temperature T = 12K. At time t = 0, the

external source is adding heat near z = 0 and z = L, and removing heat at z = L

2 at a maximum rate.
At t = 0, the diﬀerences between the two theories is rather small as shown in Fig. 11. By contrast, at the

intermediate time, t = π

2ω , when the amplitude of the external source is instantaneously zero, there is a
dramatic diﬀerence between the two theories, with smaller dissipation in the nonlocal theory. The reason

for the diﬀerence is due both to a diﬀerent phase angle δ and also a diﬀerent magnitude of the response
function ˜KT (~k, ω) predicted by the two theories. At T = 72K, the nonlocal theory is expected to predict
similar response in comparison to Fourier’s theory. In Fig. 13, a comparison is made at time t = π

2ω where
the diﬀerence should be most signiﬁcant. However, the diﬀerences are actually quite small as suggested by
the similarity in the response function ˜KT (~k, ω) at T = 72K shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.

11

In Appendix B, the expressions to determine the eﬀective thermal conductivity κef f (~k) are presented.
The response function ˜KT (~k, ω) is used to determine κef f in the static limit of the external source ω → 0.

This limit corresponds, for example, to the eﬀective thermal conductivity which is derived from applying

the Fourier law to the steady-state temperature proﬁle that is measured or computed in response to a static

heat source and sink. In an MD simulation, this corresponds to the usual “direct” method of determining

κef f [3]. It is known that the eﬀective thermal conductivity κef f determined in MD simulations using the

“direct” method is strongly dependent on system size L when L ∼ Λ, where Λ is the mean-free path for heat

carriers. In the results reported here, this will be seen as a dependence of κef f on wave vector k. Note also

that given enough data for very large simulation cells, taking the limit k → 0 should correspond to the bulk

thermal conductivity κ.

To determine κef f (k), we will consider the smallest frequency ω

ω → 0. For T = 12K and T = 72K, the results are shown in Fig. 14 as a plot of

2π = 0.012THz to approximate the limit

2π . Also included in Fig. 14 are the results obtained for the large system with L = 34.5nm
L . In addition, the Green-Kubo results from Eq.3 are included for k = 0. The results in Fig. 14
are quite similar to the dependence of the eﬀective thermal conductivity on inverse system size seen in Ref.

[3] and elsewhere. Qualitatively, the results demonstrate that partially-ballistic transport over short length

scales results in smaller eﬀective conductivity values in comparison to the bulk conductivity.

5. Discussion and conclusions

The results in this article demonstrate how nonlocal transport properties can be determined using the

Green-Kubo approach. Response functions were computed to describe the eﬀective of an external heat source

acting on a LJ solid, with comparisons made to Fourier’s law to elucidate nonlocal heat transport phenomena,

including transport in the partially-ballistic regime. In Fourier’s law, the only relevant quantities are the

thermal conductivity κ and the volumetric speciﬁc heat capacity cV which can be combined to obtain the
thermal diﬀusivity α = κ
cV

.

It was shown how quantitative determination of the response functions KT (~k, ω) can be used to simulate

the response of a system to an external heat source without the need to perform additional MD simula-

tions. Details of this approach are given in Appendix A along with corresponding expressions obtained

from Fourier’s law. It was shown that at low temperatures and relatively short length scales that transport

becomes partially ballistic and Fourier’s law predicts substantially diﬀerent results.

Finally, it was demonstrated how to obtain values for the eﬀective thermal conductivity κef f (k) corre-

sponding to the response of a system to a static external heat source. As with the eﬀective conductivity

obtained using the “direct” method, partially-ballistic transport for ﬁnite length scales results in eﬀective

conductivity values lower than those obtained in the limit k → 0. Therefore, we have demonstrated how
Green-Kubo results for the response functions KT (~k, ω) in the limit ω → 0 can be used to interpret or predict

the results of “direct” MD simulations of thermal transport.

12

We suggest that simulation results for KT (~k, ω) be used to model the response of systems to external heat

sources, especially in regimes where partially ballistic transport is relevant. Speciﬁcally, when transport is

measured over distances smaller than the mean free path Λ and heat waves with transport is primarily limited

by the sound velocity can be analyzed and modeled using the approach outlined here. It would also be useful

and interesting to compare the response functions obtained from the Green-Kubo methods to predictions

from other approaches which go beyond Fourier’s law, including the Cattaneo-Vernotte equations [23, 24],

enhanced Fourier’s law[25], dual-phase lag model[26], and the mean-free path accumulation function[27]. It

would also be interesting to use this approach to elucidate transport in superlattices, where it has been

diﬃcult to connect transport properties to the phonon spectrum of the superlattice in the limit where the

mean free path is expected to be larger than the superlattice spacing.

Finally, we return to the question of the diﬀerences between Eq. 2 from Ref.

[5] and Eq. 4 considered

in this paper. In Ref. [5], it was demonstrated how the function κ(~x, ~x′) in Eq. 2 can be determined from

analysis of the results obtained from steady-state, nonequilibrium MD simulations. Given those results, it

should be possible to determine a response function following the simple approach outlined in Eqs. 7-13.

This could be compared to the response function obtained from the assumptions made in Eq. 4. It would be

very interesting to explore whether these two approaches converge. We expect that in the case of steady-state

external sources (i.e. sources with ω = 0) the two approaches should converge. However, for time-dependent

heat sources (i.e. sources with ω 6= 0), there will be an issue in the application of the nonlocal formulation

give by Eq. 2. Namely, Eq. 2 implies that a heat-ﬂux density arises instantaneously at some distance from

where the heat pulse is added to the system. This does not account for the ﬁnite wave propagation time.

By contrast, the response functions in this paper are time-dependent, and Eq. 4 is able to account for ﬁnite

wave propagation speed.

8. Appendix A

In this appendix we derive expressions to show how to compute the heat-ﬂux density and time-dependent
temperature proﬁles due to a time-dependent input power ˜H (ext)(~k, t′). Starting from Eq. 16, we note that

13

we can write it equivalently with an integral on time,

˜J(~k, t) = −

i
cv

k

t

−∞

Z

˜K(~k, t − t′)˜u(ext)(~k, 0)δ(t′)dt′

(A1)

The quantity ˜u(ext)(~k, 0)δ(t′) is an input power, with the energy pulse at t′ = 0 given by ˜u(ext)(~k, 0). In the
linear regime we can consider a series of pulses due to an input power ˜H (ext)(~k, t′), and then we have

˜J(~k, t) = −

i
cv

k

t

−∞

Z

˜K(~k, t − t′) ˜H (ext)(~k, t′)dt′

(A2)

In this case the pulse at time t′ corresponds to ˜H (ext)(~k, t′)dt′. In Eq. 31 the input power is given in real

space, with the reciprocal-space input power deﬁned in the usual way.

It is important to note here, as

mentioned previously, the assumption of a linear response. This assumption will fail if the amplitude of the

external input power becomes large.

From these considerations we can determine the time-dependent temperature proﬁles shown in Figs. 11-
13 due to the time-dependent heating power given by Eq. 31. Using the response function ˜KT (~k, ω), it is

very straightforward to show that the heat-ﬂux density which results from the external perturbation in Eq.

implicit assumption that the external perturbation has been active for a very long period of time such that

any transient behavior can be ignored.

9. Appendix B

Here we determine the appropriate calculation to obtain the eﬀective thermal conductivity κef f (~k) from

the nonlocal response functions. From the response function in Eq. 13 obtained from Fourier’s law, it can
be veriﬁed from the expressions for ~J (~x, t) and T (~x, t) that the thermal conductivity κ can be determined
from the response functions for any wave vector ~k and frequency ω using,

For Fourier’s law, this expression is exactly correct for any wave-vector ~k and frequency ω. In the more
general case with nonlocal response functions, the eﬀective thermal conductivity κef f (~k) is deﬁned in the

same way, but requires taking the limit to ω → 0,

in which the response function corresponds to the nonlocal case determined from MD simulation. The

thermal conductivity κ can be approximately determined then from taking the limit of this expression to
