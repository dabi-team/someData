ABSTRACT

We present new spectroscopic observations obtained with GMOS@Gemini-S of
a sample of 25 H ii regions located in NGC 55, a late-type galaxy in the nearby
Sculptor group. We derive physical conditions and chemical composition through the
Te-method for 18 H ii regions, and strong-line abundances for 22 H ii regions. We
provide abundances of He, O, N, Ne, S, Ar, ﬁnding a substantially homogenous com-
position in the ionised gas of the disc of NGC 55, with no trace of radial gradients.
The oxygen abundances, both derived with Te- and strong-line methods, have similar
mean values and similarly small dispersions: 12+log(O/H)=8.13±0.18 dex with the
former and 12+log(O/H)=8.17±0.13 dex with the latter. The average metallicities
and the ﬂat gradients agree with previous studies of smaller samples of H ii regions
and there is a qualitative agreement with the blue supergiant radial gradient as well.
We investigate the origin of such ﬂat gradients comparing NGC 55 with NGC 300,
its companion galaxy, which is also twin of NGC 55 in terms of mass and luminosity.
We suggest that the diﬀerences in the metal distributions in the two galaxies might
be related to the diﬀerences in their K-band surface density proﬁle. The ﬂatter proﬁle
of NGC 55 probably causes in this galaxy higher infall/outﬂow rates than in similar
galaxies. This likely provokes a strong mixing of gas and a re-distribution of metals.

Key words: Galaxies: abundances - evolution - ISM - Individual (NGC 55); ISM: H
II regions - abundances.

INTRODUCTION

NGC 55 is the nearest edge-on galaxy at a distance of
2.34 Mpc (Kudritzki et al. 2016) and it is member of the
nearby Sculptor group consisting of approximately 30 galax-
ies (Cote et al. 1997; Jerjen et al. 2000) and being domi-
nated by the spirals NGC 300 and NGC 253. The main
properties of NGC 55 are listed in Table 1.

The nature of

the NGC 55 galaxy has been
its high inclination (79◦;
debated for
time:
Puche, Carignan & Wainscoat 1991) has allowed diﬀerent
interpretation of its morphology. It has been sometimes
deﬁned as a late-type spiral galaxy (Sandage & Tammann
1987), while in other works it has been considered as a
dwarf
irregular galaxy, similar to the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), as, e.g., de Vaucouleurs (1961). Following

de Vaucouleurs (1961) the main light concentration at visi-
ble wavelengths, which is oﬀset from the geometric center
of the galaxy, is a bar seen end-on. The structure of the
disc of NGC 55 shows asymmetric extra-planar morphology

large quantities of gas oﬀ of the disc plane still forming
stars. Otte & Dettmar (1999) found shell structures and
chimneys outside the planar regions that are signatures of
supernovae explosions and stellar winds. The composition
of its exceptionally active population of H ii regions was
studied in the past by Webster & Smith (1983), and more
recently by T¨ullmann et al. (2003) and T¨ullmann & Rosa
(2004) who studied some regions, inside and outside the
disc, respectively.

The radial metallicity gradient of NGC 55 was ﬁrst
outlined by the study of H ii regions of Webster & Smith
(1983) who found a substantially ﬂat metallicity radial pro-
ﬁle. A similar result was obtained by Pilyugin et al. (2014)
in their re-analysis of the radial metallicity proﬁles of several
late-type spiral galaxies including NGC 55. Tikhonov et al.
(2005) analysed the spatial distribution of the AGB and red
giant branch (RGB) stars along the galactocentric radius of
NGC 55, revealing again a very small metallicity gradient
also for the older stellar populations. The absence of metal-
licity gradients might suggest a coherent formation of all the
disc or very eﬃcient mixing processes since its formation.
From a sample of 12 B-type supergiant stars, Castro et al.
(2008) found a mean metallicity of −0.40 dex, a value quite
close to the LMC metallicity (see, e.g., Hunter et al. 2007)
and a ﬂat gradient. The metallicities of the two extra pla-
nar H ii regions were found to be slightly lower than those
of the central H ii regions, suggesting that they might have
formed from material that did not originate in the thin disc
(T¨ullmann et al. 2003).

From a dynamical point of view, there are a number of
works that conﬁrm tidal interactions among the three pairs
(NGC 55 and 300, 247 and 253, and 45 and 7793) of major
galaxies in Sculptor Group (see, e.g., de Vaucouleurs et al.
1968; Whiting 1999; Westmeier et al. 2013). On top of the
dynamical eﬀects of the nearby galaxies on NGC 55, the
kinematics of its central regions within the bar shows a gra-
dient in radial velocities towards the galactic centre, which is
due to ﬂow of material along the bar (Carranza & Ageeuro
1988; Westmeier et al. 2013).

The present work is part of our study of the struc-
ture and evolution of Local Group and nearby galax-
ies through the spectroscopy of their emission-line pop-
ulations (see, e.g., Magrini et al. 2005; Gon¸calves et al.
2007; Magrini & Gon¸calves 2009; Magrini et al. 2009;
Gon¸calves et al. 2012, 2014; Stanghellini et al. 2015). In this
framework, we have carried on a deep spectroscopic cam-
paign with the multi-object spectrograph GMOS@Gemini-
South telescope of the strong-line emitters of NGC 55, as
illustrated in Figure 1. The aim of the present work is to ex-
plore the distribution of abundances in this galaxy, studying
H ii regions located in the disc –from the inner disc to the
outskirts– as well as extra planar regions.

The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we de-
scribe the observations –imaging and spectroscopy– and the
data reduction process. In Section 3 we present the spectro-
scopic analysis, whereas in Section 4 we describe the spa-
tial distributions of the abundances. In Section 5 we discuss
our results and compare them with those of its companion
galaxy NGC 300. In Section 6 we give our conclusions.

2 GMOS@GEMINI-S: IMAGING AND

SPECTROSCOPY

The data analysed in the present paper were obtained with
the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) at Gem-
ini South telescope in 2012 and 2013. The two programs
through which the data were taken are GS-2012B-Q-10 and
GS-2013B-Q-12, with D. R. Gon¸calves as Principal Investi-
gator (PI) in both cases. In total we observed three ﬁelds
of view of GMOS-S, each of 5.5′×5.5′. In the following, we
refer to the three ﬁelds as M1, M2 and M3 (see Figure 1).

Pre-Imaging

We obtained the pre-imaging of NGC 55 with the GMOS-S
camera in queue mode on the 28th (M1) and 27th (M2, M3)
of August 2012. We used the on- and oﬀ-band imaging tech-
nique to identify the strongest Hα line emitters. Their loca-
tion is shown in Figure 1. For the three ﬁelds of view (FoV)
the on-band Hα images were sub-divided in 3 exposures of
60 s each, while the three oﬀ-band (the continuum of Hα)
HαC sub-exposures were of 120 s each. These narrow-band
ﬁlters have central λ (λ interval) of 656nm (654-661nm) and
662nm (659-665nm) for Hα and HαC, respectively. The lo-
cation of the three ﬁelds (5.5′×5.5 ′) is shown in Figure 1,
and the central coordinates of each ﬁeld are: for M1 R.A.
00:16:02.62 and Dec. -39:14:41.77; for M2 R.A. 00:15:26.59
and Dec. -39:12:49.08; and for M3 R.A. 00:14:59.06 and Dec.
-39:11:30.97. During the pre-imaging observations, the see-
ing varied from 0.9” to 1.′′0.

highlighted. The green symbols (plus, diamond and circle) are our H ii regions located within these three FoV, respectively. Other symbols
are as follows: cyan plus, the X-rays sources up to D25 from Stobbart, Roberts & Warwick (2006); and the two blue crosses indicate the
extra-planar H ii regions studied by T¨ullmann et al. (2003). Bottom: Our GMOS-S continuum subtracted images (Hα-HαC) of the three
FoV. The H ii regions we discuss in this paper are identiﬁed, following the IDs of Table 2. The orientation, North to the top and East
to the left is the same in all the panels.

In Table 2 we give the coordinates of the observed
emission-line objects (25 H ii regions, HIIr, and 3 candi-
date symbiotic systems, SySt). We based the classiﬁcation
of the nebulae on the analysis of their spectra, which will be
introduced in the following sections. We discriminate SySts
from H ii regions on the bases of the presence of absorption

features and continuum of late-type M giants, of the strong
nebular emission lines of Balmer H i, He ii, the simultane-
ous presence of forbidden lines of low- and high-ionization,
like [O ii], [Ne iii], [O iii] (Belczy´nski et al. 2000) and of the

Spectroscopy

The spectroscopic observations were obtained in queue mode
with two gratings, R400+G5305 (red) and B600 (blue). For
the mask M1, the spectra were taken on the 22nd (blue) and
23th (red) of December 2012. The spectroscopy of M2 and
M3, on the other hand, were obtained about one year later.
The red spectra of M2 on the 29th of September, while the
blue counterpart was observed on the 13th of October, in
2013. As for M3, the red and blue spectra were taken on the
nights of 27th and 29th of December of 2013.

We obtained three exposures per mask and grating –
with 3×1,430s for M1 and 3×1,390s for M2 and M3 both
in blue and red. For technical reasons, only one exposure of
the blue spectra of M3 and two of the red spectra of M2
were useful for science. In all the cases, we combined the
good quality exposures to increase the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of the spectra and to remove cosmic rays.

For most of the spectra the eﬀective blue plus red spec-
tral coverage range from 3500 ˚A to 9500 ˚A, in several cases
allowing a signiﬁcant overlap of the spectra. Only few lines
were measured with wavelength longer than 7200 ˚A, be-
cause of the poor (wavelength + ﬂux) calibration at the red
end of the spectra (see Figure 2). We avoided the possibility
of important emission-lines to fall in the gap between the
three CCDs, by slightly varying the central wavelength of
the disperser from one exposure to another. To do this, we
centred the red grating R400+G5305 at 750 ±10 nm and
the blue one B600 at 460 ±10 nm.

The masks were built with slit widths of 1′′ and with
varying lengths to include portions of sky in each slit for a
proper local sky-subtraction. The spectroscopic observations
were spatially×spectrally binned. The ﬁnal spatial scale and
reciprocal dispersions of the spectra were: 0.′′144 and 0.09 nm
per pixel, in blue; and 0.′′144 and 0.134 nm per pixel, in red.
Following the usual procedure with GMOS for wave-
length calibration, we obtained CuAr lamp exposures with
both grating conﬁgurations, either the day before and af-
ter the science exposures. The spectrophotometric standard
LTT7379 (Hamuy et al. 1992) was observed with the same
instrumental setups as for science exposures, on September
2nd 2013, and used for ﬂux calibration of the three masks,
since no standards were obtained near the observation of M1,
in 2012. In Figure 2 we show a sample with fully reduced
and calibrated GMOS spectra, one spectrum per ﬁeld, on
which it is straightforward to see the quality of our data.

Data were reduced and calibrated in the standard way
by using the Gemini gmos data reduction script and
long-slit tasks, both being part of IRAF2

Figure 2. Sample of our GMOS spectra, one per FoV, M1, M2
and M3, for the H ii regions H-11, H-17 and H-23, respectively.
The CCD gaps in the blue part of H-23’s spectrum were masked,
since in this case only one spectrum was good enough for science,
so the CCD gaps could not be erased by the combination of dif-
ferent frames. Also note the red spectrum of H-17, noisier than
in of the other two H ii regions due to the fact that 2, instead of
3 spectra were combined to obtain this one.

3 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS AND

DETERMINATION OF THE PHYSICAL
AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES

We measured the emission-line ﬂuxes and their errors with
the package SPLOT of IRAF. Errors take into account the
statistical errors in the measurement of the ﬂuxes and the
systematic errors (ﬂux calibrations, background determina-
tion and sky subtraction).

We corrected the observed line ﬂuxes for the eﬀect of
the interstellar extinction using the extinction law of Mathis
(1990) with RV=3.1 (which is assumed to be constant as in
our Galaxy, but might slightly vary from galaxy to galaxy,
see, e.g., Clayton et al. (2015)) and the individual reddening
of each H ii region given by the cβ, i.e., the logarithmic diﬀer-
ence between the observed and theoretical Hβ ﬂuxes. Since
Hδ and Hγ lines are fainter than the Hα and Hβ ones, and lo-
cated in the bluer part of the spectra, they are consequently
aﬀected by larger uncertainties. We thus determined cβ com-
paring the observed Balmer I(Hα)/I(Hβ) ratio with its theo-
retical value, 2.87 (case B. c.f., Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).
We used lines in common between the blue and red part of
the spectra to put the two spectral ranges on the same ab-
solute ﬂux scale. The average scaling factor applied to the
ﬂuxes of the red spectra is 0.78.

and extinction corrected intensities –both normalised to
Hβ=100– of the emission lines of the 25 H ii regions listed
in Table 2. The spectra of the candidate symbiotic systems
will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.

The method to derive the physical and chemical con-
dition in H ii regions is described in the previous papers
of this series, as for instance Magrini & Gon¸calves (2009);
Gon¸calves et al. (2012, 2014): the temden and ionic tasks
of IRAF3 are used to derive ﬁrst electron temperature (from
the ratio of the [O iii] lines at 500.7 nm and 436.3 nm), and
density (from the lines of the [S ii] doublet at 671.7 nm and
673.1 nm) of the gas, then ionic abundances. Ionic abun-
dances are combined with the ionisation correction factors
for H ii regions from Izotov et al. (2006) to obtain the total
abundances.

Often, literature studies represent H ii regions with a
two-zone ionisation structure characterised by two diﬀerent
electron temperature, for the [O ii] and [O iii] emitting re-
gions. If available Te[O II] –or equivalently Te[N II] – are
used for the [O ii] zone, while Te[O III] is adopted in the
[O iii] emitting zone. When Te[O II] or Te[N II] are not
measured, the relation, based on the photoionisation mod-
els of Stasi´nska (1982), Te[O II]=0.7×Te[O III]+3000 K (or
a similar one) is adopted. If we consider valid without errors
the linear relation between Te[O II] and Te[O III], in the
temperature range of our H ii regions, the use of a single
temperature (the measured one, i.e., Te[O III]) might im-
ply a maximum underestimation of about ∼700 K and up
to a maximum overestimation of ∼400 K of the tempera-
ture adopted for the [O ii] ionic abundance. We have tested
the eﬀect of adopting two diﬀerent temperatures and, for
most regions, it has negligible eﬀect on the total oxygen
abundance –of the order 0.01-0.03 dex– since [O iii] ionic
abundance is on average a factor 10 larger than [O ii] ionic
abundance, and consequently it is the ionic fraction that
contributes the most to the total O/H. Thus we use only
the measured Te[O iii] for the calculation of the abundances
of both low- and high-ionisation species.

The abundances of He i and He ii were computed us-
ing the equations of Benjamin et al. (1999) in two density
regimes, that is Ne > 1,000 and 6 1,000 cm−3. Clegg’s col-
lisional populations were taken into account (Clegg 1987).

The results of physical and chemical properties of the
H ii regions are shown in Table 3. The Te has been measured
in 18 regions and ranges from 8,600 to 12,000 K; Ne is
available in 10 regions, while an upper limit is measured
in other 6 regions. The measurements of electron densities
range from 100 to 600 cm−3, typical values of H ii regions,
with a higher density of 1400 cm−3 in H-13. Errors on
ﬁnal abundances take into account the errors on Te on
Ne and on the line ﬂuxes. The average oxygen abundance
determined with the Te method, excluding lower limit
abundances, is 12+log(O/H)=8.13±0.18. For the other ele-
ments we obtain average values: 12+log(N/H)=7.18±0.28,
12+log(Ar/H)=6.00±0.25,
12+log(Ne/H)=6.81±0.14,
12+log(S/H)=6.04±0.25. Helium abundance
and
is
quite uniform too. Its mean value, linearly expressed, is
He/H=0.092±0.019. The mean O/H is in good agreement

NGC 55 (8.05±0.10 with the Te-method). The two extra-
planar H ii regions of T¨ullmann et al. (2003) are instead
slightly metal poorer (7.77 and 7.81) than our average O/H,
but they are still consistent with the composition of some
individual H ii regions, as for instance H-19, H-20, H-21.
This might be an indication of incomplete mixing in the
disc of NGC 55.

3.1 Strong-line metallicities

We computed oxygen abundances using strong-line meth-
ods to increase the number of regions with a determined
metallicity. These methods are based on the intensities of
lines that are usually easy to measure because they are
much stronger than the lines used as Te diagnostic (c.f.
Arellano-C´ordova et al. 2015, for a complete discussion and
comparison among the methods). The strong-line ratios
can be calibrated in two diﬀerent ways: using photoion-
isation models or using abundances of H ii regions ob-
tained through the Te-method. Since the empirical calibra-
tion works better in the low metallicity regime, we have used
the new calibrations based on Te-method abundances by
Marino et al. (2013, hereafter M13) of the two well-known
indices, N2=log([N ii]/Hα) and O3N2=log[([O iii]/Hβ)([N
ii]/Hα)]. The results are shown in Table 4 where we present
the galactocentric distances, O/H from the Te-method, the
metallicities derived with the M31’s N2 and O3N2 indices,
and an average between the two strong-line calibrators,
which is the value adopted in the following ﬁgures. Errors
on the adopted strong-line O/H take into account the ﬂux
uncertainties and the intrinsic errors of the method (0.18
and 0.16 dex, for O3N2 and N2, respectively, as quoted in
M13).

Comparing the average oxygen abundance derived with
the Te-method, 12+log(O/H)=8.13±0.18, with the average
values determined with the strong-line method, we have: for
the N2 index 12+log(O/H)=8.14±0.12, for the O3N2 index
12+log(O/H)=8.20±0.14, and for the combination of the
two indices 12+log(O/H)=8.17±0.13. They are thus in ex-
tremely good agreement. The increment of the number of
regions analysed with the strong-line methods provides an
even smaller dispersion of the distribution of the abundances
in NGC 55 pointing towards a very homogeneous composi-
tion for the interstellar medium for this galaxy.

4 RADIAL ABUNDANCE GRADIENTS IN

NGC 55

The H ii regions for which we can determine plasma condi-
tions, including Te, Ne, ionic and total abundances, give us
the opportunity to study the spatial distribution of abun-
dances and abundance ratios of several elements in the
thin/thick disc of NGC 55. We have computed the lin-
ear galactocentric distances de-projecting and transform-
ing them in linear distances with the inclination, posi-
tion angle and distance of Table 1. We use the range of
4◦ in the inclination angle obtained by the disc model of
Puche, Carignan & Wainscoat (1991) to estimate the un-
certainties in de-projected galactocentric distance. The new

Figure 3. Radial abundance gradients of elemental abundances in the H ii regions in NGC 55. The abundances of metals (O, N, Ne,
Ar, S) are expressed in the logarithmic form 12+ log(O/H), whereas the abundance of helium is expressed in linear form. The continuous
curves are the weighted linear ﬁts to the data, taking into account errors on both distances and abundances.

model of Westmeier et al. (2013) is consistent with the one
of Puche in the inner part of the galaxy where our regions
are located.

The sample of H ii regions (see green symbols in Fig-
ure 1) are located in a large galactocentric range of distances
(from the centre to about 12 kpc, see Table 4).

In Figure 3 we show the radial abundance gradients of
several elements: O, Ne, S, Ar, N and He. In Table 5 we
report the slopes and the intercepts of the radial abundance
gradients computed with the fitexy routine that takes into
account both the errors on abundances and galactocentric
distances. For all the available elements we found null gra-
dients, within the errors.

NGC 55 radial gradients of O/H and N/H have
been also recently re-analysed from literature data by
Pilyugin et al. (2014). They found oxygen and nitrogen gra-
dients essentially ﬂat, and in good agreement with our re-
sults (see Table5). Their slopes for oxygen and nitrogen are
-0.0059±0.0104 dex kpc−1 and -0.0042± 0.0145 dex kpc−1,
respectively. On the other hand, Kudritzki et al. (2016)
analysed a sample of 58 blue supergiant stars. For the ﬁrst
time, they detected a non negligible metallicity gradient
of -0.22±0.06 dex/R25 (-0.020±0.005 dex kpc−1 assuming

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–12

R25=11.0 kpc). Their central metallicity relative to the Sun
is Z=-0.37±0.03.

The comparison between the H ii region and blue su-
pergiant populations is extremely interesting because they
both are young populations and should trace the same epoch
in the galaxy lifetime. In the upper panel of Figure 4 we
plotted the metallicity of the supergiants of Kudritzki et al.
(2016) and of our H ii regions –reported on the Solar
scale (12+log(O/H)=8.66; Grevesse et al. 2007)– versus the
galactocentric distance. We have plotted the whole sample of
Kudritzki et al. (2016) without removing the possible out-
liers. The two sets of metallicities and their radial distribu-
tions are in surprisingly good agreement considering all the
internal uncertainties of the two metallicity derivations, the
diﬀerences in the metallicities measured from nebular and
stellar spectra (oxygen in the former, a global Z metallicity
in the latter), and possible dust depletion of oxygen in H ii
regions (this correction might amount to 0.10 dex for objects
with 7.8<12+log(O/H)< 8.3); see Peimbert & Peimbert
2010). It is, however, true that the supergiant abundances
show a small decreasing gradient, which is not appreciable
in the H ii region population abundances.

4.1 α-elements and nitrogen

Giving the similar origin of the four α-elements –O, Ne, S
and Ar– we expect them to have similar radial behaviours.
We indeed ﬁnd almost ﬂat gradients within the uncertainties
for all of them, with Ar having possibly a small negative
slope, still consistent with a null gradient, within the errors.
While α-elements are mainly synthesised by massive
stars (M>8 M⊙), nitrogen has a more complex nucleo-
genesis, having both a “primary” and a “secondary” ori-
gin. The primary origin refers to conversion of the origi-
nal hydrogen into nitrogen and it happens in stars with
4 M⊙ <M<8 M⊙ (Renzini & Voli 1981) and/or in very mas-
sive (M>30M⊙) low metallicity stars (Woosley & Weaver
1995), while the secondary channel is related with the pro-
duction from C and O initially present in the ISM at the
formation of the progenitor star. When the primary nitro-
gen component dominates, the N/O ratio is expected to be
independent of the oxygen abundance and this happens at

giants from Kudritzki et al. (2016) (empty stars) radial distri-
bution. The continuous line is the ﬁt to the H ii regions with

low metallicity. At higher metallicity, the secondary produc-
tion becomes more important, and N/O increases with O
(van Zee et al. 1998).

The comparison of N with any α-element can give indi-
cation on diﬀerent star formation history in diﬀerent radial
regions of NGC 55 disc. If a galaxy experiences a dominant
global burst of star formation, the ISM oxygen abundance
will increase in about 106 yr, generating a decrease in N/O.
Then over a period of several 100×106 yr N/O will increase
at constant O/H. Consequently N/O can be used as a clock
that measures the time since the last major burst of star for-
mation: low values of N/O imply a very recent burst of star
formation, while high values of N/O imply a long quiescent
period (cf. Skillman 1998). In Figure 5, the radial gradi-
ent of N/O is shown. A slightly decreasing gradient towards
the outskirts is detected. However this gradient is consistent
with 2-σ with a ﬂat gradient and homogeneous distribution
of abundances, indicating no diﬀerences in the star forma-
tion histories in diﬀerent parts of the galaxy. We can also
compare the typical N/O value in NGC 55 with those of
dwarf and spiral star forming galaxies. From Figure 5 of
Pilyugin et al. (2003) or Figure 7 of Annibali et al. (2015)
we can infer that at 12+ logO/H∼8.0 dex, there is an in-
creasing dispersion in N/O, with values ranging from −1.6
to −1 dex. N/O in NGC 55 is located towards the upper
envelope of this relationship. The average N/O of NGC 55

where Y is the mass fraction of He, and Z is the metallicity.
Using Equation 2 of Izotov et al. (1997) without correction
for the neutral He (<2%, cf. Izotov et al. 1997), we com-
puted the mass fraction of He using the mean abundance
of NGC 55, obtaining Y=0.27±0.08. Excluding the H ii re-
gion with the highest He abundance (H-1) we have a mean
He/H=0.088±0.020 and thus Y=0.26±0.04. The linear re-
gression of Izotov et al. (1997) of Y versus oxygen, computed
at the metallicity of NGC 55 gives a slightly lower value
Y=0.250±0.002, but still consistent within the errors with
our determination. The measurement of He abundance in
NGC 55 does not give any particular constraint to the pri-
mordial He abundance, but it is in line with the determina-
tion of Y in several low metallicity galaxies.

5 DISCUSSION

Figure 5. Radial N/O gradients of H ii regions of NGC 55.

(N/O= −0.93±0.21) is close to the M33’s one (see, e.g., Fig-
ure 12 in Magrini et al. 2007, for a plot of N/O vs O/H) and
to that of the LMC (N/O=-0.96; Carlos Reyes et al. 2015).
The scatter in N/O values at a given O/H seen, e.g., by
Pilyugin et al. (2003) and Annibali et al. (2015), can be nat-
urally explained by diﬀerences in the star formation histories
of galaxies (Pilyugin et al. 2003). This conclusion was al-
ready suggested by Edmunds & Pagel (1978) who explained
the observations of the N/O abundance ratio in external
galaxies due to the manufacturing of N in low-mass stars
of 4-8 M⊙. Very recently, Vincenzo et al. (2016) presented
chemical evolution models aimed at reproducing the ob-
served N/O versus O/H abundance pattern of star-forming
galaxies in the Local Universe. They found that position of
a galaxy in the N/O vs. O/H plane is mostly determined by
its star formation eﬃciency (see their Figure 4). The high
N/O ratio in NGC 55 with respect to other late-type dwarf
irregular galaxies having the same O/H might be an indi-
cation that the bulk of the star formation happened in the
recent past, more than 100×106 yr ago. This is in agreement
with the ﬁnding of Davidge (2005) of a vigorous star forma-
tion episode during the past 0.1-0.2 Gyr. The detection of
signiﬁcant numbers of stars evolving on the AGB phase, in-
dicates that there has been vigorous star formation during
the past 0.1-0.2 Gyr. In this time lapse, stars with masses
M>5 M⊙ might had time to evolve and to pollute with N
the ISM of NGC 55 and thus to increase the N/O ratio.

4.2 Helium

The measurement of He in low metallicity galaxies has been
often used to extrapolate the primordial He abundance.
To account for the amount of helium synthesised by stars,
Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert (1974) suggested for the ﬁrst
time to study a sample of H ii regions spanning a wide range
of metallicity. With the assumption of a helium enrichment
proportional to metallicity, we can obtain the primordial
abundance of He extrapolating to zero metallicity:

Y = YP + Z(∆Y /∆Z),

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–12

NGC 55 has both been classiﬁed as an irregular and a spiral
galaxy. However, although its morphology cannot be well
deﬁned because of its inclination, it is a very extended object
and with a large total mass (see Table 1); its H ii regions
are found up to 11-12 kpc from the centre, and its blue and
red supergiants even much farther (Kudritzki et al. 2016).
So, the questions are: how can the composition of its H ii
regions (and supergiants) be so homogeneous in such a wide
region, extending from the centre to about ∼11-12 kpc? Why
is not there a clear metallicity gradient from the H ii region
abundances?

The presence of metallicity gradients

in irregu-
indeed, deeply investigated in
lar galaxies has been,
reaching the conclusion that most of
the literature
these galaxies
composi-
show a spatial homogenous
tion (e.g., Kobulnicky & Skillman 1997; Croxall et al.
2009; Magrini & Gon¸calves 2009; Haurberg et al. 2013;
Lagos & Papaderos 2013; Hosek et al. 2014; Patrick et al.
2015). There are some exceptions, such as, for instance,
the observed oxygen gradient in NGC 6822 (Venn et al.
2004; Lee et al. 2006) and in the dwarf blue compact galaxy
NGC1750 (Annibali et al. 2015), or the iron gradients in the
SMC, in the LMC, and in the dIrr WLM (Leaman et al.
2014). The systematic study of gradients in late-type spi-
ral and irregular galaxies by Pilyugin et al. (2014, 2015) has
shown that there is a strong correlation between the radial
abundance gradient of galaxies and their surface brightness
proﬁles. In particular, galaxies with a steep inner surface
brightness proﬁle usually present a noticeable radial abun-
dance gradient. On the other hand, those galaxies with ﬂat
inner surface brightness proﬁles have shallower or null gra-
dients. The reason of this diﬀerent behaviour might be re-
lated to the presence of radial mixing of gas (through radial
ﬂows or galactic fountains): this process takes place more
evidently in galaxies with a ﬂat surface density inner proﬁle
that can readily redistribute the gas across the disc.

The comparison of metallicity distributions and sur-
face density proﬁles in the galaxy pair, NGC 55 and
NGC 300 (Scd for NGC 300 and barred spiral/irregular
SB(s)m for NGC 55) allows us to investigate this hypoth-
esis in detail. These two galaxies are indeed very similar
in many aspects: comparable near-IR magnitudes (K=6.25
and 6.38, respectively, see Jarrett et al. 2003) and mid-
infrared ﬂuxes (see Dale et al. 2009) that point towards

10 Magrini, Gon¸calves & Vajgel

comparable stellar masses. However, they have diﬀerent
morphologies. Even more important, Kudritzki et al. (2016)
have shown that their K-band radial surface proﬁles are
also diﬀerent, with NGC 300 having a strong central peak,
which is instead absent in NGC 55 (see their Figure 12).
The radial metallicity gradient of NGC 300 from H ii re-
gions, studied by Bresolin et al. (2009) and re-analysed by
Stasi´nska et al. (2013), is not negligible, and has a slope -
0.068±0.009 dex kpc−1 (with R25=5.3 kpc), as well as the
radial metallicity gradient of supergiants (Kudritzki et al.
2008; Gazak et al. 2015). These gradients are shown in the
lower panel of Figure 4.

Thus, in the light of the discussion of Pilyugin et al.
(2015), it seems that the diﬀerent K-band radial surface pro-
ﬁles imply a diﬀerent mass accretion/gas outﬂow in the two
galaxies, with a consequent much higher re-distribution of
metals in NGC 55 with respect to NGC 300. Kudritzki et al.
(2016) concluded that the chemical evolution of NGC 55 is
characterised by large amounts of gas outﬂow and infall, hav-
ing one of the largest known infall rate in the Local Universe.
This agrees well with the detailed morphological, kinematic
and dynamic study of the neutral gas by Westmeier et al.
(2013) who concluded that internal and external processes,
such as satellite accretion or gas outﬂow have stirred up the
gas disc, inducing streaming motions of the gas along the
bar of NGC 55. In addition, Westmeier et al. (2013) made
evident several isolated H i clouds within about 20 kpc pro-
jected distance from NGC 55. These clouds are similar to the
high-velocity clouds of the Milky Way and they are a signa-
ture of on-going infall of gas and of the complex dynamics
of NGC 55.

We also took advantage of the available X-rays data for
NGC 55 to test the possibility that the intense star-forming
events of the galaxy blow out the heavy elements, out of its
disc to the galaxy halo. As detailed in Appendix A, the X-
rays luminosity and SFR from the 12 of our 25 H ii regions
for which data exists in the Chandra archive, are not con-
sistent with the scenario on which the ﬂat metallicity gradi-
ent would be justiﬁed by blow up of heavy elements due to
extreme winds. Stobbart, Roberts & Warwick (2006) (their
sources that are located within the optical conﬁnes of the
galaxy are signed in Figure 1), studying the X-ray proper-
ties of NGC 55 using XMM-Newton observations, derived
the physical properties of the soft residual disc component
and found the SFR equal to 0.22 M⊙ yr−1 and the pres-
sure of the hot gas (P/k) equal to ∼ 1.5×105 K cm−3. This
later value is similar to the pressure inferred for the interior
of the Loop 1 superbubble within our Galaxy (Willingale
2003). The authors conclude that although this is broadly
consistent with the scenario where there has been suﬃcient
recent star formation in the disc of NGC 55 to form ex-
panding bubbles responsible for ejecting the material out of
the disc into the halo, the absence of an extended extra-
planar soft X-ray component in NGC 55 (contrary to what
was found by Oshima 2002) points to the fact that the gas
in such bubbles cools relatively quickly through adiabatic
losses, retaining insuﬃcient energy to power a superwind of
the form frequently seen in systems with SFR > 1 M⊙ yr−1
(Strickland 2004). So, our H ii region sample does not pro-
duce enough superwind in NGC 55, which is in agreement
with previous analysis, though we should keep in mind that

from all the star formation indicators, the X-ray is the weak-
est one.

Therefore all the above discussions suggest that the
dominant eﬀects in ﬂattening the metallicity gradient of
NGC 55 are those related to the dynamics of the gas through
bar-driven mixing and inﬂow/outﬂow.

6 CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper we show new spectroscopic observations
of a large sample of 25 H ii regions in the Sculptor group
member galaxy, NGC 55. We derive physical and chemical
properties though the Te-method of 18 H ii regions, and
strong-line abundances for 22 H ii regions. We measure also
abundances of He, O, N, Ne, S, Ar. We found a homogenous
composition of the disc of NGC 55, with average abun-
dances of He/H=0.092±0.019, 12+log(O/H)=8.13±0.18,
12+log(Ne/H)=6.81±0.14,
12+log(N/H)=7.18±0.28,
12+log(Ar/H)=6.00±0.25
and 12+log(S/H)=6.04±0.25.
The abundances are uniformly distributed in the radial
direction. This agrees with the study of smaller samples of
H ii regions (Webster & Smith 1983; Pilyugin et al. 2014)
and it is in qualitative agreement with the blue supergiant
radial gradient (Kudritzki et al. 2016). We investigate the
origin of such ﬂat gradient comparing NGC 55 with its
companion galaxy, NGC 300, similar in terms of mass and
luminosity and located in the same group of galaxies. The
most plausible hypothesis is related to the diﬀerences in
their K-band surface density proﬁle that, as suggested by
Pilyugin et al. (2015), which can provide higher mixing of
the NGC55 gaseous component than in similar galaxies.

APPENDIX A: X-RAY LUMINOSITY

We complemented our observations with the available X-ray
observations of the H ii regions in NGC 55 in the Chandra
archive.

The analysis of the X-ray emission for the 25 nebulae
consists basically of measuring the source net counts and
then converting the count rate into X-ray ﬂux and luminos-
ity. We used archival Chandra observation (ObsID 2255)
with exposure of 60.1 ks of NGC 55, performed in 2001
September with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer
(ACIS-I). The Chandra data were reduced and reprocessed
using the science threads of Chandra Interactive Analysis of
Observations (CIAO) version 4.6.

The ﬁrst step after reprocessing the data has been to es-
timate the background counts used to obtain the net source
counts for each Hα emitter from Table 1. The background
contribution in the 2-10 keV band has been evaluated in
a nearby source-free circular region with a radius of 30′′.
The X-ray count rates of the nebulae were estimated inside
a circular region too. The optimal size of each Hα emit-
ter has been measured by eye in the Hα images. The back-
ground count normalised by the source area has been sub-
tracted from the source count. The net count rates were
obtained by dividing the net counts by the data exposure
time. To convert the net count rates to X-ray ﬂux in the
2-10 keV energy band, we use the PIMMS4 software pack-
age routine. We calculated the count-to-energy conversion
assuming a given spectral model, temperature, abundance
and hydrogen column density. We adopted the astrophysical
plasma emission code mekal (Liedahl,Osterheld & Goldstein
1995), with a metallicity equal to 0.4 Z⊙ and a temperature
of 1 keV. The hydrogen column density (21 cm) towards
NGC55 was obtained from Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB)
Survey of Galactic H i and is equal to 1.37×1020 cm−2.

Once the net count rates were converted to ﬂuxes, we de-
termined the luminosity, L2−10keV . The k-correction from
B¨ohringer et al. (2000) has been applied to obtain the rest-
frame X-ray luminosity. From the rest-frame L2−10keV we
estimated the star formation rate using:

SFR(> 0.1M⊙) =

L2−10keV

3.8 × 1039erg s−1 M⊙ yr−1,

(A1)

from Persic & Rephaeli (2007). Because for most of the
sources we have only X-ray upper limits, i.e. their emis-
sion is below the background level, we did not attempt to
perform any quantitative analysis in this energy band. This
quantities are only used to have an insight of the SFR. The
so-obtained net counts, used apertures to measure the X-ray
emission, luminosities and the respectively SFR are listed
in Table A. The negative values of the net counts mean
that their emission is below the background level, these cor-
respond to the sources with X-ray upper limit. From the
25 Hα emitters only 12 have reliable measured X-ray emis-
sion. The rest-frame X-ray luminosities span from 1035 to
1037 erg s−1 and their respective SFRs range from 10−4 to
10−3 M⊙ yr−1. The SFR of the individual Hα emitters is,
as expected, much lower than the global SFR of NGC55
(∼0.22 M⊙ yr−1; Engelbracht et al. 2004) estimated with
Spitzer far-infrared (24 µm) data.
