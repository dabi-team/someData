In the present work we study non-rotating dark stars in f (R) modiﬁed theory of gravity.
In
particular, we have considered bosonic self-interacting dark matter modelled inside the star as
a Bose-Einstein condensate, while as far as the modiﬁed theory of gravity is concerned we have
assumed Starobinsky’s model R + aR2
. We solve the generalized structure equations numerically,
and we obtain the mass-to-ratio relation for several diﬀerent values of the parameter a, and for
two diﬀerent dark matter equation-of-states. Our results show that the dark matter stars become
more compact in the R-squared gravity compared to General Relativity, while at the same time the
highest star mass is slightly increased in the modiﬁed gravitational theory. The numerical value of
the highest star mass for each case has been reported.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A plethora of current observational data coming from
many diﬀerent sides show that we live in a spatially ﬂat
Universe that expands in an accelerating rate dominated
by a dark sector, while ordinary stuﬀ we are familiar with,
such as photons, neutrinos and baryons, comprise only a
5% of the energy density of the Universe [1]. The dark
sector, consisting of dark matter and dark energy, is one
of the biggest challenges of modern theoretical cosmology,
as its origin and nature still remain a mystery.

The concordance cosmological model, based on cold
(collisionless) dark matter and a cosmological constant,
has been very successful as it is in excellent agreement
with a vast amount of observational data. However, the
cosmological constant problems have forced us to explore
other possibilities, such as dynamical dark energy mod-
els [2] with a time varying equation-of-state parameter
or modiﬁed gravity models, e.g. f (R) theories of gravity
[3, 4], where the Ricci scalar R in the Einstein-Hilbert
term of General Relativity (GR) is replaced by a generic
function. Furthermore,
long time ago self-interacting
dark matter was proposed in order to eliminate or at least
alleviate some apparent conﬂicts between the collisionless
dark matter paradigm and astrophysical observations [5].
Although the main motivation nowadays to study f (R)
theories of gravity is to explain the current cosmic accel-
eration, the astrophysical implications of this class of the-
ories should also be investigated. Normal main-sequence
stars and compact stars have been used to test and con-
strain alternative gravitational theories [6, 7],as well as
dark matter models [8–12]. Compact objects, such as
neutron stars or strange quark stars, are the ﬁnal fate of
stars, and thanks to their extreme conditions that cannot
be reached in Earth-based experiments, comprise excel-
lent cosmic laboratories to test and constrain alternative

gravitational theories. First it was pointed out in [13]
that f (R) theories of gravity cannot support interior solu-
tions of relativistic stars, and they are thus unacceptable.
However, in [14] the authors showed that whether or not
relativistic stars exist or not depends on the behaviour of
the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor. Rel-
ativistic stars in f (R) theories of gravity have also been
studied in [15–20].

Recently it was shown that compact stars made en-
tirely of self-interacting dark matter may exist [21].
In that work bosonic dark matter with a short-range
repulsive potential was modelled inside the star as a
Bose-Einstein condensate. In this scenario a polytropic
equation-of-state of the form P (ǫ) = Kǫ2 was derived,
where the constant K was found to be [21]

K =

2πl
m3
χ

(1)

with mχ being the mass of the dark matter particle, while
l is the scattering length that determines the dark matter
self-interaction cross section σχ = 4πl2. The properties
of compact stars made of ordinary matter admixed with
condensed dark matter have been studied in [22–25], and
similarly admixed with fermionic matter in [26–29].

Boson stars, albeit in a diﬀerent context, have been
already studied in [30–35] and more recently in [36]. The
maximum mass for bosons stars in non-interacting sys-
tems was found in [30, 31], while in [32, 33] it was pointed
out that self-interactions can cause signiﬁcant changes.
In [34, 35] the authors constrained the boson star pa-
rameter space using data from galaxy and galaxy cluster
sizes.

It is the aim of this work to study condensed dark stars
in f (R) theories of gravity, and in particular in Starobin-
sky’s model f (R) = R + aR2 [37]. From a theoretical
point of view the R-squared gravity is well-motivated,
since higher order in R terms are natural in Lovelock
theory [38], and also higher order curvature corrections
appear in the low-energy eﬀective equations of Super-
string Theory [39]. Our work is organized as follows: In
the next section we present the model and the structure

equations, while in section 3 we discuss our numerical re-
sults. Finally we ﬁnish concluding our work in the fourth
section.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

The model is deﬁned by the following action in the

so-called Jordan frame

In the following we shall be considering the Starobin-
sky’s model f (R) = R + aR2, where a
0 is the only
free parameter of the gravitational theory, and clearly
the a = 0 case corresponds to GR. The parameter a has
dimensions [mass]−2, and therefore it can be written also
in the form a = 1/M 2, where now the mass scale M is
the free parameter of the theory.

[18–20, 40, 41]

where G is Newton’s constant, gµν is the metric tensor,
R is the Ricci scalar, and SM is the matter action that
depends on the metric tensor and the matter ﬁelds ψi. To
avoid pathological situations, such as ghosts and tachy-
onic instabilities, it is required that viable f (R) theories
satisfy the conditions [3, 4]

˜Tµν = A(φ)2Tµν

(10)

Varying with respect to the metric tensor and the scalar
ﬁeld one obtains Einstein’s ﬁeld equations as well as the
Klein-Gordon equation

and in particular in the case of a perfect ﬂuid the energy
densities and the pressures in the two frames are related
via [18]

Clearly when the scalar ﬁeld is absent one recovers the
usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ equations [42]. The
system of coupled equations is supplemented with the
EoS P (ǫ) = Kǫ2 as well as with the initial conditions at
the center of the star

λ(0) = 0
φ(0) = φc

(21)

where ǫc and φc are the central values of the dark matter
energy density and of the scalar ﬁeld respectively, and the
last condition ensures the regularity of the scalar ﬁeld. In
principle one could handle the problem in perturbations
theory, assuming that the parameter a is small and there-
fore the higher order term in R just perturbs the GR so-
lution. However, it was shown in [18] that in dealing with
relativistic stars an analysis based on perturbation theory
does not provide us with reliable results, and therefore
in the present work we shall treat the problem exactly,
i.e. non-perturbatively. We wish to stress the fact that
contrary to ǫc, φc is not an arbitrary initial value but it
must be determined self-consistently. In the next section
we explain how this is done.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Before we discuss the numerics and present our ﬁndings
let us ﬁrst discuss the limits that current data put on the
free parameters of the model, namely M and K. First, it
is known that a light scalar ﬁeld can mediate a long range
attractive force leading to a modiﬁcation to the usual
Newtonian potential 1/r. Thus, to avoid solar system
tests the scalar ﬁeld must be heavy enough. In [43] the
authors obtained the expression for the Post-Newtonian
parameter γ in f (R) theories of gravity, which has been
measured by the Cassini spacecraft. From the one hand
the parameter γ in f (R) theories it is computed to be

γ =

exp(
3 + exp(

(22)

where m is the mass of the scalar ﬁeld, which in Starobin-
sky’s model is given by m = M/√6 [18, 43]. On the other
hand the Cassini mission provides us with the measure-
ment [44]

and b) two dark matter EoSs, one stiﬀ and one soft,

We remark in passing that these values of the a pa-
rameter are also ﬁne with the emission of gravitational
radiation from observed binary systems. For the calcu-
lation in the framework of GR see e.g. [50, 51], while for
the relevant calculation in f (R) gravity see [52–54].

A ﬁnal remark is in order here regarding the solution
of the exterior problem. It is known that f (R) theories
of gravity admit static spherically symmetric black hole
solutions of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter form [55], where
the lapse function is given by f (r) = 1 + c1/r
R0/12,
with c1 being an arbitrary integration constant related to
the mass of the black hole, and R0 being the root of the
algebraic equation Rf ′(R) = 2f (R), while the prime de-
notes diﬀerentiation with respect to R. For Starobinsky’s
model R0 = 0, and the black hole solution is precisely
Schwarzschild without a cosmological constant. This can
be easily seen using the equations presented before valid
in the Einstein frame (without matter P = 0 = ǫ) as
follows. If we assume solutions with a constant value for
the scalar ﬁeld, φ = const = φ0, that in addition cor-
responds to an extremum of the potential, V,φ(φ0) = 0,
then the two last equations are automatically satisﬁed,
while the ﬁrst two are essentially the tt and rr equations
of GR with a cosmological constant Λ = V (φ0)/2 [56].
For the Starobinsky’s model φ0 = 0 = V (φ0), and we
thus obtain the anticipated Schwarzschild black hole so-
lution. This implies that in the exterior problem solution
all three quantities P = ǫ = φ = 0, and therefore when
we consider the interior problem solution we must require
that both the dark matter energy density and the scalar
ﬁeld vanish on the surface of the star

ǫ(R∗) = 0
φ(R∗) = 0

(31)
(32)

which clearly is not possible for any φc. Therefore for a
given equation of state (or K value), a given f (R) model
(or a value) and a given ǫc the scalar ﬁeld central value
φc is determined requiring that φ, ǫ vanish simultaneously
at the surface of the star. Finally, as usual the condition
P (R∗) = 0 determines the radius of the star R∗, while
the star mass M∗ is given by M∗ = m(R), where we have
introduced a new function deﬁned by

2m(r)
r

(33)

In Fig. 2 we show the star mass (in solar masses) versus
the star radius (in km) for the stiﬀ EoS (black colour in
Fig. 1) and for the 3 diﬀerent values of a. For comparison,

the mass-to-ratio relation that corresponds to GR is also
shown in black. As we increase a the curves are shifted
downwards. For low radii the curves lie one very close
to another and begin to separate at R∗ 14.5km. For a
given mass the DM star in GR is characterized by a larger
radius, and therefore the higher order term in R makes
the star more compact. Fig. 3 corresponds to the soft
equation-of-state (magenta colour in Fig. 1). The pattern
observed in the previous plot is repeated here. The part
of the curves that corresponds to large radius and low
mass is obtained for low central energy density, while the
part of the curves that corresponds to high mass and low
radius is obtained for high central energy density. The
curves exhibit a maximum precisely in that part, and
this corresponds to the highest star mass which increases
with a. In Tables I and II we report the numerical values
of the highest mass supported by each EoS in a given
gravitational theory.

Note that since the second EoS is softer the highest
star mass is lower, as it could have been anticipated.

Also note that the causality requirement cs
being the speed of sound, forces us to stop at a certain
point, since for suﬃciently high central energy density

K the maximum allowed ǫc is given by ǫmax

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied dark stars in Starobinsky’s model
f (R) = R + aR2, and we have solved the structure equa-
tions numerically to produce the mass-to-radius relation
for the relativistic stars. The dark matter is assumed to

5

be bosonic and self-interacting modelled inside the star as
a Bose-Einstein condensate leading to a polytropic EoS.
We have worked in the Einstein frame where the presence
of a scalar ﬁeld modiﬁes the standard TOV equations,
and we have treated the higher order in R term non-
perturbatively. We have produced the M
R diagram
for two EoSs, one stiﬀ and one soft, and for 3 diﬀerent
values of the parameter a compatible with solar system
tests. Our results show that the modiﬁed theory of grav-
ity makes the relativistic stars even more compact, while
at the same increase slightly the highest star mass, the
values of which are reported.
