The two stages dynamical stochastic model developed earlier for description of fusion-ﬁssion reac-
tions is applied to the calculation of mass- and energy-distributions of ﬁssion fragments of platinum
isotopes in reaction 36Ar +142 Nd →178−x Pt + xn. The ﬁrst stage of this model is the calculation of
the approaching of projectile nucleus to the target nucleus. On the second stage of the model, the
evolution of the system formed after the touching of the projectile and target nuclei is considered.
The evolution of the system on both stages is described by three-dimensional Langevin equations
for the shape parameters of the system. The mutual orientation of the colliding ions and tunneling
through the Coulomb barrier in the entrance channel are also taken into account. The potential
energy of the system is calculated within the macroscopic-microscopic approach. The calculated
mass-energy distributions of ﬁssion fragments are compared with the available experimental data.
The impact of shell eﬀects, rotation of the system and neutron evaporation on the calculated results
is discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst theoretical description of nuclear ﬁssion dis-
covered in 1939 [1, 2] was given in the framework of the
liquid drop model [3], in which it is assumed that the
properties of the atomic nucleus are similar to those of a
charged viscous incompressible liquid drop. It turned out
that the liquid drop model predicts splitting of ﬁssioning
nucleus into two fragments with the same masses, what
was conﬁrmed by experiments of highly excited nuclei.
However, in the case of low excitation energies, such as
the ﬁssion of 235U by thermal neutrons, the masses of
the ﬁssion fragments were not equal. The explanation of
mass-asymmetric ﬁssion was given later by the inﬂuence
of shell eﬀects. The presence of mass-asymmetric ﬁssion
valley for transuranium elements was demonstrated by
Pashkevich in [4].
In this work the dependence of the
potential energy of nuclei on their deformation was con-
structed using the shell correction method of Strutinsky
[5, 6] and it was shown that the ﬁssion process is strongly
aﬀected by the deformation dependence of the potential

energy of the system. Further progress in the description
of the process of nuclear ﬁssion is associated with the use
of statistical [7, 8] and dynamical [9, 10] models, as well
as their combinations [11]. These models describe the
ﬁssion of a nucleus initially located in a potential well
near the ground state (compound nucleus). Such an ex-
cited compound nucleus can be formed by irradiating of
atomic nuclei by light particles.

The description of the ﬁssion process becomes much
more complicated if the excited nucleus was formed in
the result of fusion reaction of two massive ions. In this
case, one can’t talk merely about the ﬁssion of compound
nucleus. From the moment of touching of the initial nu-
clei to the moment of formation of the compound nucleus
passes quite a long time, during which the system may
undergo ﬁssion or may reduce its excitation energy by
emitting a light particle or gamma quanta and form the
compound nucleus in the ground state. As the result, for
the description the mass distribution of ﬁssion fragments
it is necessary to consider the whole evolution of fusion-
ﬁssion process starting from the approaching of the ini-
tial nuclei to each other and ending with the formation
of compound nucleus or ﬁssion.

For this purpose in [12–14] the so called two-stage dy-
namic stochastic model for description of fusion-ﬁssion
reaction with heavy ions was developed. In this model
on the ﬁrst stage of calculations the approaching of pro-

 
 
 
 
 
 
jectile nucleus to the target nucleus up to their touching
point is considered. On the second stage we study the
evolution of compact system, formed after merging of
colliding nuclei.

In present work we apply the two-stage model [12–14]
for the description of the kinetic energy and mass distri-
butions of the ﬁssion fragments obtained in recent publi-
cation [15] for the reaction 36Ar +142 Nd →178−x Pt + xn
at beam energy Elab = 153.9, 168.8 and 178.8 MeV. This
publication contains experimental data on the energy-
and mass-distributions of ﬁssion fragments, average en-
ergy taken away by the pre-ﬁssion neutrons, average
induced angular momentum and the rotational energy.
Comparison of such data with calculated results would
be a good test for the theoretical models.

II. THE TWO-STAGE APPROACH

For the calculation of fusion-ﬁssion reaction with heavy
ions we use the two-stage dynamic stochastic model [12–
14]. As it was mentioned above, on ﬁrst stage of calcu-
lations we consider the approaching of projectile nucleus
to the target nucleus up to their touching point. On the
second stage we study the evolution of compact system,
formed after merging of colliding nuclei. The schematic
comparison of the potential energy in fusion and ﬁssion
channels is shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁnal point of the second
stage calculations could be the splitting of the system
back into two fragments or formation the evaporation
residue 178−xPt, where x is a number of neutrons, evap-
orated by the compound system in order to reduce its
excitation energy. Of course, the outcome depends on
the reaction energy.

36Ar +142 Nd−→178 Pt.

The evolution of both separated ions and compact sys-

tem is described by Langevin equations for the collective
parameters that ﬁx the shape of the system. For the ap-
proaching process the collective parameters are the pa-
rameters αp and αt of quadrupole deformation for both
ions and the distance r between their centers of mass.
On the approaching stage we also take into account the
orientation of target nucleus – the angle θt between the
symmetry axis of the deformed in the ground state tar-
get nucleus and the line connecting centres of mass of
colliding nuclei. The shape of the compact system is
described by the parameters α, α1 and α4 of Cassini pa-
rameterization [4] that specify the total elongation, the
mass asymmetry and neck radius of the system.

and 142Nd (r= 12.1 fm, αt = αp = 0.05, solid) and the ﬁt by
3-dimensional (α, α1, α4) Cassini ovaloids (dash).

At the end of the ﬁrst stage calculations (at the touch-
ing point) we ﬁx the center-of-mass distance, the poten-
tial and internal (dissipated) energy of the system. At
the initial point of the second stage calculations we use
this data to deﬁne the shape of the system, formed af-
ter collision of the initial nuclei. To do it we use three
conditions. First we ﬁx α4 and deﬁne α and α1 from the
requirement that the center of mass distance r and the
mass asymmetry of separated ions and the compact sys-
tem are the same. Then, we vary α4 and among all pos-
sible shapes, which satisﬁes that requirement, we chose
the one, that corresponds to the lowest potential energy
Edef (α, α1, α4) of compact shape. An example of relation
between the shapes of separated ions and the compact
system is shown in Fig. 2.

At both stages of calculation the time evolution of
the collective degrees of freedom q ≡ {α, αn} and corre-
sponding momenta p/m ≡ { ˙α, ˙αn} is described in terms
of the Langevin equations [16, 17], namely,

˙qβ = µβνpν,

˙pβ = −

∂µνη
∂qβ

+ Kβ − γβνµνηpη + θβνξν . (1)

Here qβ are the deformation parameters and a conven-
tion of summation over repeated indices ν, η is used.
The quantity γβν is the tensor of friction coeﬃcients and
µβν is the tensor inverse to the mass tensor mβν, Kβ is a

 
 
 
 
 
 
component of the conservative force ~K = − ▽ F , where
F = Vpot − aT 2 is the free energy of the system, Vpot – its
potential (deformation) energy, a is the level density pa-
rameter [8] and the temperature T of system is related to
the internal (dissipated) energy by the Fermi-gas formula
T =

Edis/a.

p

Friction provides the dissipation of collective motion
energy into internal energy. The ﬂuctuations in the sys-
tem are described by the random force θβνξν. Here ξν is
a random number with the following properties

< ξν > = 0,

< ξβ(t1)ξν (t2) > = 2δβνδ(t1 − t2).

(2)

The magnitude of the random force θβν is expressed in
terms of diﬀusion tensor Dβν = θβηθην, which is related
to the friction tensor γβν via the modiﬁed Einstein rela-
tion Dβν = T ∗γβν, where T ∗ is the eﬀective temperature
[18].

The internal energy of the system could be calculated

from the energy conservation condition:

Ecm = Vpot + Ekin + Edis,

(3)

here Ecm = ElabANd/(ANd + AAr) is the reaction energy,
calculated in the center-of-mass system, and Ekin is the
kinetic energy of the collective motion.

def and E(p)

Some terms of the equation (1) should be determined
twice, ones for the ﬁrst, and ones for the second stage
of calculations. Such terms we will denote by the upper
indexes (I) and (II), respectively.
The deformation energy E(t)

def of colliding
ions and Edef of the combined system are calculated
within the macroscopic-microscopic shell-correction ap-
proach proposed by Strutinsky [4–6]. The interaction
potential between the colliding ions consists of Coulomb
part VCoul [19] and nuclear VGK – Gross-Kalinowski po-
tential [20] , which was modiﬁed [17] in order to describe
the interaction of deformed ions. The rotation of the
system is also taken into account on the both stages of
calculations:

EI

rot =

ℏ2L(L + 1)
2(M r2 + Jt + Jp)

,

EII

rot =

ℏ2L(L + 1)

, (4)

where M = MtMp/(Mt + Mp) is the reduced mass of
target and projectile, Jt, Jp and J are the rigid body
moments of inertia of the target, projectile nucleus and
of the combined system, respectively, and L is an angular
momentum of the whole system.

Finally, the potential energy of the system is:

pot = VCoul + VGK + E(t)
V I
pot = Edef + EII
V II
rot.

(6)

Besides the deformation energy, the dynamic properties
of each nucleus are characterized by the friction γβν and
inertia mβν tensors, that were calculated within the lin-
ear response approach and local harmonic approximation
[21, 22]. In this approach many quantum eﬀects such as

3

shell and pairing eﬀects, and the dependence of the col-
lisional width of single particle states on the excitation
energy, are taken into account. The precise expressions
for the components of the friction γβν and inertia mβν
tensors can be found in [23]. Tensors γβν and mβν [23]
characterize completely the inertia and friction proper-
ties of the combined system and were used in our previous
calculations within three-dimensional Langevin approach
with Cassini shape parameterization and the two-center
shell model shape parameterization [24].

αtαt = mt

For the ﬁrst stage of calculation, besides the internal
processes in ions, one should account also for their rel-
ative motion. The inertial tensor mI
βν in this case has
only diagonal components: mI
rr = M (reduced mass),
αα, mI
mI
θtθt = Jt. The fric-
tion tensor for the ﬁrst stage of the process was deﬁned
as the sum of friction tensor for the relative motion , ob-
tained in the surface-friction model [25], like it was done
in [26], and the diagonal friction tensor for colliding ions,
which has only two non zero components (γI

III. THE RESULTS OF FIRST STAGE
CALCULATIONS

In the present paper, the ﬁrst stage calculations were
ended as soon as the system overcomes the potential bar-
rier. The position of the barrier depends on deformations
and orientation of the colliding ions. It also slightly de-
pends on angular momentum of the system (see ﬁg. 3).
As one can see, some experimental data in [15] are ob-

points r1 and r2 in the subbarrier region and E is the in-
cident energy, equal to the potential energy of the system
at the turning points. As one can see from Fig. 4 (bot-
tom), the account of quantum tunneling increases sub-
stantially the probability of penetration throw the barrier
in the subbarrier region.

The angular momentum is a free parameter of our
model. So, the ﬁrst stage calculations are carried out
for various values of L. One can see from Fig. 3, that
the height of potential barrier increases with the angular
momentum of the system. The probability to overcome
the barrier will decrease in this case, see Fig. 4. Know-
ing the probability of event, we can calculate its partial,

respectively:

The distribution in Fig. 5d is the distribution of rota-
tional energy at the touching point. The width of this
distribution is very small. The contribution to this width
comes from the uncertainly of center-of-mass distance r
(which is also small, see Fig. 5a) that appears in the mo-
ment of inertia in Eq. (4).

Each point in Fig. 5d is the contribution of trajectory
”i” that reached the touching point. By summing over
all trajectories one can deﬁne the average angular mo-
mentum hLi and the average rotational energy hEroti of
the system at the touching point,

of dissipated energy hEdisi ≈ 4.40 MeV. As we can see,
the sum of rotational and dissipated energy at the touch-
ing point is not so large compared with the excitation
energy E∗=50.5 MeV.

Starting from the touching point under the action of
random force the system would move in the direction
of ground state, form the compound nucleus and then
undergo ﬁssion. The evolution of the compound nucleus
could last long enough to evaporate gammas or light par-
ticles, so we should take into account this de-excitation
process. The evaporation of particles and γ-quanta by
the excited compact system is described in our approach
within the statistical model [8]. On each integration step
the partial width of the corresponding decay channel [8]
is calculated, then by the hit-and-miss method we de-
cide whether some particle was emitted and which kind
of particle was emitted. If some particle was emitted, the
binding energy of this particle was subtracted from the
excitation energy of the system. Also the particle can
carry away some energy (its kinetic energy).

The main evaporation channel is the evaporation of
neutrons. Probability of the neutron evaporation and its
kinetic energy depends on the dissipated energy of the
system (see Fig. 7). One can see, that system with dissi-
pated energy Edis = 40 MeV, for example, should live on
average 400 zs before ﬁrst neutron is evaporated. After
evaporation it loses about 10 MeV as a neutron kinetic
and binding energy, so, to evaporate the second neutron
it needs about 1500 zs, and so on. Of course, during this

evolution time there is a competition between neutron
evaporation and ﬁssion. The ﬁssion of nucleus can oc-
cur before it evaporates any neutron (dashed line), or it
could evaporate one (short dashed line), two (dotted line)
or more neutrons before ﬁssion (see Fig. 8). The maxi-
mal number of the evaporated neutrons depends on the
initial excitation energy of the system E∗, see Eq. (12).
After evaporation of several neutrons the systems in-
ternal energy decreases and the role of the nuclear shell
structure become more and more signiﬁcant. In Fig. 9
one can see the evolution of fragment mass distribution
due to the de-excitation process (for the initial excitation
energies E∗ = 39.6 MeV and E∗ = 50.5 MeV). The mass
distribution is symmetric if the system undergoes ﬁssion
before it evaporates any neutron. Then, after the ﬁrst
neutron evaporation, the system slightly cools down and

FIG. 9: The contributions to the total ﬁssion cross section of
278Pt (solid) at E∗=39.6 MeV and 50.5 MeV of the ﬁssion
events without neutron evaporation (dash), with evaporation
of one neutron (dash-dot) and two (dot) neutrons.

The total mass distribution obtained by superimposing
of distributions shown in Fig. 9 is compared in Fig. 10
with the experimental data [15]. One can see that the
calculated mass distributions for all three values of exci-
tation energy E∗ are very close to the experimental data.

fragments. The prescission kinetic energy KE(pre)
is the
kinetic energy in ﬁssion direction obtained from the so-
lutions of Langevin equations at the scission point.
It
turned out in these calculations that the average value
of KE(pre) is very small, of the order of 1 ÷ 2 MeV and
the main contribution to TKE comes from the Coulomb
repulsion energy.

as it was argued in [15]. We see the two ﬁssion valleys
on potential energy surface at large elongation, beyond
the saddle point, see Fig. 12. Between saddle and scis-
sion the mass-symmetric valley is even deeper compared
with mass-asymmetric. However, it follows from the cal-
culations that the dynamical trajectories do not follow
the bottom of ﬁssion valley. The mass- and energy-
distributions are formed mainly at the saddle. The tra-
jectories spend a lot of time inside saddle. Some of them
reach the saddle and move very quickly towards the scis-
sion. The descent from saddle to scission in 178At (and
other light ﬁssioning nuclei) is very short, see Fig. 12,
and steep. The trajectories do not have much time to ad-
just themselves to the potential energy landscape during
saddle-to-scission motion. Note also, that the mass asym-
metry of asymmetric valley beyond the saddle is much
larger as (coinciding with experimental) mass asymme-
try of PES at the saddle.

The average value of TKE is equal to 130.4 Mev what is
rather close to the position of main peak, TKEhigh=133.4
MeV, in experimental results [15]. The width of TKE-
distribution σT KE= 11 MeV is, however, much smaller
than experimental value, see Fig. 2a of [15]. The dif-
ference might be attributed to the uncertainty of scis-
sion point conﬁguration formed in the reaction, the ﬁnite
(in)accuracy of TKE measurements and some limitations
of theoretical approach.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Within the developed earlier two-stage approach for
the fusion-ﬁssion reactions we have studied the reaction
36Ar +142 Nd →178−x Pt + xn. The obtained results are
compared with the available experimental data. The cal-
culated mass distributions of ﬁssion fragments for three
energies Ecm=122.78, 134.68 and 142.58 MeV are in good
agreement with the experimental data [15]. The most
probable mass division for asymmetric component of ﬁs-
sion fragments mass distribution (Fig. 10) is found to be
about AL/AH = 79/98, what is rather close to the ex-
perimental data [15]. From our calculations it follows
that the competition between symmetric and asymmet-
ric ﬁssion channels is caused by the enhancement of shell
eﬀects in the compound nucleus due to the process of its
de-excitation by neutron emission.

The average value of TKE is equal to 130.4 Mev what is
rather close to the position of main peak, TKEhigh=133.4
MeV, in experimental results. The calculated shape of
distribution is very close to a single Gaussian. We did
not ﬁnd the contributions to TKE-distribution from two
ﬁssion modes as it was argued in [15].

From the results of calculations it follows that the dy-
namical trajectories do not follow the bottom of ﬁssion
valley and the mass- and energy-distributions of ﬁssion
fragments of 178Pt are formed mainly at the saddle.
