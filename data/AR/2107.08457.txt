Abstract

This paper presents a fault-tolerant control scheme for constrained linear systems. First, a new variant of the Reference Governor (RG)
called At Once Reference Governor (AORG) is introduced. The AORG is distinguished from the conventional RG by computing the
Auxiliary Reference (AR) sequence so that to optimize performance over a prescribed time interval instead of only at the current time
instant; this enables the integration of the AORG with fault detection schemes. In particular, it is shown that, when the AORG is combined
with a Multi-Model Adaptive Estimator (MMAE), the AR sequence can be determined such that the tracking properties are guaranteed
and constraints are satisﬁed at all times, while the detection performance is optimized, i.e., faults can be detected with a high probability
of correctness. In addition a reconﬁguration scheme is presented that ensures system viability despite the presence of faults based on
recoverable sets. Simulations on a Boeing 747-100 aircraft model are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the AORG scheme in
enforcing constraints and tracking the desired roll and side-slip angles. The effectiveness of the presented fault-tolerant control scheme in
maintaining the airplane viability in the presence of damaged vertical stabilizer is also demonstrated.

Key words: Reference Governor, Constrained Control, Fault Detection, Fault-Tolerant Control, Reconﬁguration Scheme.

Introduction

The satisfaction of constraints (e.g. operational limits and
actuator range and rate limits) is a crucial requirement for
the control of many real-world systems. There are two typ-
ical choices to ensure constraint satisfaction. One choice is
to design the controller within the model predictive control
framework [1, 2]. The other choice is to decouple the prob-
lem of the stabilization of the system from the problem of
satisfying the constraints [3]. In particular, a prestabilized
system can be augmented with an add-on unit called Ref-
erence Governor (RG) that, whenever necessary, modiﬁes
the reference signal to ensure constraint satisfaction [4–6].
Notably, a novel scheme called Explicit RG has been intro-
duced recently [7–11], which deals with constrained refer-
ence tracking without resorting to on-line optimization.

Equipment faults/failures are the main source of industrial

safety hazards [12–14]. As a result, designing a suitable
fault-tolerant control scheme to mitigate the impacts of faults
on the stability and performance of the systems has gained
a great attention in recent years, e.g., [15–17]. The fault-
tolerant control schemes presented in the literature typically
consist of two units [18,19]: 1) a fault detection unit, which
detects the presence of a fault and identiﬁes its nature, and 2)
a control reconﬁguration strategy, which modiﬁes the con-
trol law to continue operating the system with potentially de-
creased/degraded functionality/availability despite the pres-
ence of the fault.

One key issue that is overlooked in most of existing literature
is the system viability, which is characterized by measures
of operational capability and satisfaction of operating con-
straints. Note that when a fault occurs, in many real-world
applications, the most immediate objective is not to recover
asymptotic properties (e.g. stability), but to ensure that the
constraints are not violated during the transient. Indeed, the
violation of constraints may have catastrophic consequences,
making it impossible to recover a safe operation.

The need for fault-tolerant constrained control has been rec-
ognized in [20], where a control scheme has been presented
which ensures constraint satisfaction despite the presence of
faults, while optimizing control and detection performances.

 
 
 
 
 
 
The scheme presented in [20] applies the control sequence in
open loop, which may make the system vulnerable to distur-
bances or model mismatch. Some fault-tolerant constrained
control schemes based on model predictive control [21, 22]
and RG [6] have been presented in the literature as well. In
particular, [23] considers the application of an MPC-based
fault-tolerant control to deal with failures in both engines
of a Boeing 747-200F. In [24, 25] a distributed MPC fault-
tolerant scheme is developed for deterministic constraints.
Adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme have been presented
in [26, 27], which can address deterministic constraints on
state and input of the system. An adaptive fault-tolerant
constrained control scheme has been developed to for com-
mercial aircraft with actuator faults and constraints in [28].
Fault-tolerant control of Euler-Lagrange systems has been
discussed in [29], where the output of the systems has to sat-
isfy a deterministic constraint. Recently, an RG-based recon-
ﬁguration scheme has been introduced in [30]. Even though
the proposed scheme can effectively recover stability and
constraint satisfaction properties after detecting the fault, it
does not address the fault detection as it assumes that the
fault can be detected immediately upon occurrence.

This paper proposes a RG-based fault-tolerant constrained
control scheme, which addresses control, fault detection,
and reconﬁguration objectives. The structure of the proposed
scheme is depicted in Fig. 1. Our motivation to use RG-
based schemes is that they provide add-on solutions, which
can be attractive to practitioners interested in preserving an
existing/legacy controller or concerned with computational
burden and tuning complexity. Additionally, and as illus-
trated in this paper, they can non-conservatively restrict the
operation of the system, which facilitates the ability of the
system to recover from faults. First, we propose At Once
Reference Governor (AORG), which can be utilized to ad-
dress tracking and constraint satisfaction requirements. This
AORG is distinguished from the conventional RG by opti-
mizing and applying the AR sequence over a time interval
rather than at a given time instant. In order to detect the fault
occurrence, we adopt the Multi-Model Adaptive Estimator
(MMAE) [31, 32]. It will be shown that a bound on the de-
tection performance can be expressed as an explicit func-
tion of the AR sequence over an interval. Two optimization
problems will be formulated to determine the AR sequence
during transient and at steady-state, such that to optimize
the performance of the MMAE, while ensuring constraint
satisfaction at all times. Finally, a reconﬁguration scheme
will be proposed to maintain functionality of the system de-
spite the presence of the fault. This reconﬁguration scheme
is based on the recoverable sets [30, 33].

The main contributions of this paper are: 1) presenting the
AORG and proving its convergence and constraint-handling
properties, 2) proving that the AORG can be integrated with
the MMAE such that both control and detection objectives
are addressed simultaneously, and 3) proposing a reconﬁgu-
ration scheme to maintain the viability of the system despite
the presence of the fault.

Fault-Tolerant Constrained Control Scheme.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 states the problem. Section 3 introduces the AORG
scheme, and proves its constraint enforcement and conver-
gence properties. In Section 4, ﬁrst, the MMAE is brieﬂy
discussed. It is then proven that, combined with the AORG,
it is possible to determine the AR sequence such that the
performance of the MMAE is optimized. A reconﬁguration
scheme is also proposed to recover system stability and con-
straint satisfaction property. Section 5 evaluates the effec-
tiveness of the proposed scheme on a Boeing 747-100 air-
craft in the presence of vertical stabilizer failure. Finally,
Section 6 concludes the paper.

2 Problem Statement

Consider the following discrete-time LTI system with mul-
tiple operating modes:






x(t + 1|µ)= Ao,µ x(t|µ) + Bo,µ u(t|µ) + ωµ (t)

y(t|µ)= Cx(t|µ) + ξ (t)

,

(1)

where µ ∈ M = {µ1, · · · , µ f } is the index of the mode of the
system, x(t|µ) is the state of the system operating in mode µ
at time t, u(t) ∈ Rp is the control input at time t, y(t|µ) is the

output of the system operating in mode µ at time t, and the
process noise ωµ (t) ∈ Rn and the measurement noise ξ (t) ∈
Rm are mutually independent Gaussian processes with zero
mean and covariance matrices Hωµ ∈ Rn×n and Hξ ∈ Rm×m,
respectively. The Ao,µ and Bo,µ are the open loop dynamics
and inputs matrices in operating mode µ. The model (1) can
represent a system with f − 1 fault scenarios that manifest
themselves as changes in the system matrices. The model µ1
corresponds to the nominal system operating without faults.
Note that we assume that sensors are not affected by the
faults.

Remark 1 As an example, actuator faults can be captured
by the model (1). In this paper, the failure of the ith actuator
is represented by zeroing out the ith column of the matrix Bo.

In order to stabilize the system in each mode, we use the
following feedback plus feedforward control law:

u(t|µ) = Kµ x(t|µ) + Gµ v(t),

(2)

where Kµ ∈ Rp×n is the feedback gain matrix, Gµ ∈ Rp×m
is the feedforward gain matrix, and v(t) ∈ Rm is the vector
of reference commands (set-points). Thus, the closed-loop
system takes the following form:






x(t + 1|µ)= Aµ x(t|µ) + Bµ v(t) + ωµ (t)

y(t|µ)= Cx(t|µ) + ξ (t)

,

(3)

where Aµ = Ao,µ + Bo,µ Kµ and Bµ = Bo,µ Gµ . We assume
that the feedback gain Kµ is such that Aµ is strictly Schur
for all µ ∈ M.

Suppose that when the system is operating in mode µ, its
state and reference have to satisfy constraints of the follow-
ing form,






E [z1(t|µ)] ∈ Z1
P (z2(t|µ) ∈ Z2) ≥ β

,

where

z1(t|µ) = Lxx(t|µ) + Lvv(t) + ζ (t),
z2(t|µ) = Fxx(t|µ) + Fvv(t) + ς (t),

(4)

(5)
(6)

In this paper we consider the following problem:

Problem 3 Consider system (3) which is subject to con-
straints (4). Suppose that the operating mode of the system
may change at anytime as a result of a fault/failure. Let
r(t) ∈ Rm be the desired reference which is known over a
sufﬁciently long preview window into the future at each time
instant. For a given initial condition x(0), develop a scheme
to generate the AR signal v(t) such that constraints (4) are
satisﬁed at all times, and for a constant desired reference,
v(t) tends to the desired reference r(t).

To address this problem, we will ﬁrst present the AORG
scheme. Then, it will be shown that the AORG can be inte-
grated with a fault detection scheme and a reconﬁguration
strategy, such that constraint satisfaction and convergence
properties are retained.

3 At Once Reference Governor

As shown in Fig. 1, in the proposed fault-tolerant constrained
control scheme, AORG is utilized to manipulate the AR se-
quence. Unlike the conventional RG, AORG computes the
AR sequence over a speciﬁed horizon. Unlike the conven-
tional RG, AORG does not recompute the AR sequence at
the next time instant rather it applies the AR sequence over
this speciﬁed horizon and recomputes it at the end of this
horizon for the next horizon. Such an implementation is ad-
vantageous as it is able to improve fault detectability through
reference manipulation (as will be shown in Subsection 4.3)
and is applicable, e.g., to situations where commands repre-
sent waypoints which can be assumed to not change during
each preview horizon. Note, however, that with AORG the
system looses ability to respond to commands during each
preview horizon.

In this section, we explain the general formulation of AORG,
while its integration into the fault-tolerant constrained con-
trol scheme shown in Fig. 1 will be discussed in Subsection
4.3. Consequently, and to simplify the notations, we drop
the explicit dependence on µ in this section. On the other
hand, since we are concerned with the k step ahead predic-
tions made at time t, this will be reﬂected in the modiﬁed
notations.

Fv ∈ Rnc×p, nc is the number of chance constraints, ζ (t) ∼
N(0, Hζ ), and ς (t) ∼ N(0, Hς ). The constraint sets Z1 ⊂ Rne
and Z2 ⊂ Rnc are compact, convex, and contain the origin.
Note that z(t|µ) = [z1(t|µ) z2(t|µ)](cid:62) can represent real mea-
surable outputs of the system, or can be used to represent
the constraints on the state and input of the system.

3.1 Preliminaries

In this subsection, we present two propositions that will
be used in this paper. The ﬁrst proposition shows that the
chance constraint given in (4) can be enforced by enforcing
a condition on the noise-free output. The second proposition
shows how this can be done when the constraint set is a
polytope.

straints satisfaction within the interval [t,t + T ]. Hence, in
the following section, we will provide a method to compute
a subset of O∞ which ensures constraints satisfaction at all
times.

3.2.2 A Constraint-Admissible Subset of O∞

One possible way to compute a constrained-admissible sub-
set of O∞ referred to as ˜O∞, which ensures constraint satis-
faction from time t onward is to use the following set recur-
sion:

3.2 AORG: Formulation and Properties

Let T > 0 be a chosen horizon and [t,t + T ] be a given
command planning interval.

3.2.1 The Maximal Output-Admissible Set

The maximal output-admissible set is deﬁned as the set of
all initial states x and input sequences v0, · · · , vT , such that,
assuming the input vT is constantly applied from the time
instant t + T onward, the ensuing outputs will always satisfy
the constraints (4):

O∞ =

(cid:110)
(x, v0, · · · , vT ) : ˆz1(k|x, v0, · · · , vT ) ∈ Z1 and

and ˆz1(k|t) and ˆz2(k|t) can be computed via (8), with initial
condition ˆx(0|t) = x, and v(t + k) = vk for k = 0, · · · , T , and
Bε is an open ball of radius ε > 0. Simply, ¯Φ is the set
of all initial conditions x and input sequences v0, · · · , vT
that steer the system such that the constraints are satisﬁed
within the interval [t,t + T ], and vT is strictly steady-state
admissible. Note that by Assumption 2, ¯Φ is compact and
˜O0 is compact and convex. Note that each
convex. Thus,
recursive update in (15) can be performed by simple ofﬂine
linear algebra computations, and thus does not cause real-
time implementation issues.

Lemma 6 The ˜O∞ computed via the set recursion (15) is
compact and convex. Furthermore, it is ﬁnitely determined,
i.e., there exists k∗ ∈ Z≥0 such that ˜Ok∗ = ˜O∞.

PROOF. First, note that: 1) since Z2 is compact and convex,
it can be shown [35] that Z2 ∼ P
β (k) is compact and convex
for all k ∈ Z≥0, and 2) according to the set recursion given
in (15), we have ˜Ok+1 ⊂ ˜Ok, ∀k ∈ Z≥0.

We know that ˜O0 is compact and convex. According to (15),
˜O1 is equal to ˜O0 ∩ Φ1. Note that Φ1 is closed and convex,
as Z1 and Z2 ∼ P
β (1) are compact and convex. This means
that ˜O1 is compact and convex. Therefore, by induction, it
can be proven that ˜Ok, ∀k ∈ Z≥0 is compact and convex.

According to (13)-(14), since A is assumed to be strictly
Schur, for any 0 < ε (cid:48) < ε with ε as deﬁned above, there exist
k(cid:48) > 0 such that for all k ∈ Z≥k(cid:48) we have

which means that (x, v0, · · · , vT ) ∈ Φk. Thus, according to
(15) and by induction, we have (x, v0, · · · , vT ) ∈ ˜Ok. On the
other hand, we know that ˜Ok ⊂ ˜Ok(cid:48), ∀k ∈ Z≥k(cid:48). Therefore,
there exists k∗ ≤ k(cid:48) such that ˜Ok∗ = · · · = ˜Ok(cid:48) = ˜Ok(cid:48)+1 = · · · =
˜O∞. (cid:50)

3.2.3 Determination of the AR

Once ˜O∞ is computed, the following AORG scheme can be
employed to compute the AR within the interval [t,t + T ]
by solving the following optimization problem:

3.2.4

Infeasibility-Handling Mechanism

Due to system (3) having stochastic noise inputs, the com-
puted AR by an AORG may not be recursively feasible.
More speciﬁcally, the previously admissible reference v(t +
T ) may be no longer constraint admissible at the begin-
ning of the interval [t + T + 1,t + 2T + 1], i.e., (x(t + T +
1), v(t + T )) (cid:54)∈ Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞. In this case, as an infeasibility-
handling mechanism, the reference will be kept unchanged
for one step, i.e., v(t + T + 1) = v(t + T ). The feasibil-
ity will be checked again at t + T + 1. If it is feasible,
the AORG will compute the AR over the shifted interval
[t +T +2,t +2T +2]; or else, the AR will be kept unchanged
for one more step.

3.2.5 Properties

The constraint-handling and convergence properties of the
AORG will be proven in the following theorems. In order
to prove some of these properties, we will follow a similar
procedure to that of [36].

Theorem 7 Consider the sequential distinct intervals with
length of T + 1, starting from 0. Suppose that the AORG
as in (22) is used to compute the AR over the intervals.
Also, suppose that the the infeasibility-handling mechanism
described in Section 3.2.4 is employed. Then, constraints (4)
are satisﬁed at all times.

PROOF. Suppose that (x(t), v(t − 1)) ∈ Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞ for
some t ∈ Z≥0. Let k(cid:48) = inf{k ∈ Z≥0 : v(t + K) (cid:54)= v(t − 1)},
which is greater than 0 and possibly unbounded. Namely,
k(cid:48) is the ﬁrst instant after t that the AR changes.

Regarding the expectation constraint, according to (7) and
(8), and since ˜O∞ ⊂ Φk, ∀k, we have

E [z1(t + k)] = E [ˆz1(k|t) + ˜z1(k|t)] = ˆz1(k|t) ∈ Z1,

(23)

for k ∈ {0, · · · , k(cid:48) − 1}. Similarly, regarding the chance con-
straint, we have

P (z2(t + k) ∈ Z2) = P (ˆz2(k|t) + ˜z2(k|t) ∈ Z2)
β (k)(cid:1) = β ,

≥ P (cid:0)˜z2(k|t) ∈ P

(24)

for k ∈ {0, · · · , k(cid:48) − 1}. Thus, the use of the infeasibility-
handling mechanism described in Section 3.2.4 (i.e., the AR
at the beginning of each interval changes only if the previ-
ous value is feasible) implies that (x(t + k(cid:48)), v(t + k(cid:48) − 1)) ∈
Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞.

Therefore, assuming that (x(0), v(−1)) ∈ Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞ and
consequently (x(1), v(0)) ∈ Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞, where v(0) is com-
puted by the AORG as in (22), by induction, it can be shown
that the constraints (4) are satisﬁed at all times. (cid:50)

Theorem 8 Suppose that at time t which is the beginning of
an interval, the previously admissible AR is no longer con-
straint admissible (i.e., (x(t), v(t − 1)) (cid:54)∈ Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞) and
thus it remain unchanged. There exists a k(cid:48)(cid:48) ∈ Z≥0 such that
(x(t + k(cid:48)(cid:48)), v(t − 1)) ∈ Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞, i.e., the system will even-
tually enter a conﬁguration where it is safe to change the
AR.

PROOF. Suppose that (x(t), v(t − 1)) (cid:54)∈ Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞ for
some t ∈ Z≥0 which is the beginning time of an interval.
This means that the infeasibility-handling mechanism dis-
cussed in Section 3.2.4 will keep the AR unchanged until the
time that it is safe to change. Let e(t + k) = x(t + k) − ˆx(k|t)
be the prediction error at time t + k, ∀k ∈ Z≥0, where ˆx(k|t)
is as in (8).

Since A is strictly Schur, for any 0 < ε (cid:48) < ε/2, there exists
k(cid:48) such that for all k ≥ k(cid:48) we have

Gaussian measure [38], it can be shown [36] that almost
surely there exits k(cid:48)(cid:48) ≥ k(cid:48) such that LxAke(t + k(cid:48)(cid:48)), FxAke(t +

PROOF. Suppose that v(t) is the AR at time t ∈ Z≥0.
The AORG ensures that the convergence error, deﬁned
as the distance between the desired reference and the
AR,
the AORG en-
sures that (cid:107)r − v(t + k)(cid:107) = (cid:107)r − v(t + k − 1)(cid:107) if v(t + k) =
v(t + k − 1), and (cid:107)r − v(t + k)(cid:107) < (cid:107)r − v(t + k − 1)(cid:107) if
v(t + k) (cid:54)= v(t + k − 1), ∀k ∈ Z≥0. Thus, we only need to
prove that if v(t + k) = v(t + k − 1) for a k ∈ Z≥0, there
exists a k(cid:48)(cid:48) > k such that v(t + k(cid:48)(cid:48)) (cid:54)= v(t + k − 1).

Suppose that v(t + k) = v(t + k − 1). There are two rea-
sons for this: 1) it is imposed by the infeasibility-handling
scheme, and 2) it is the optimal solution obtained by (22).
As proven in Theorem 8 for the ﬁrst reason, and following
the same procedure of the proof of Theorem 8 for the sec-
ond reason, for any 0 < ε (cid:48) < ε/2 there exists k(cid:48)(cid:48) such that
for k ∈ {0, · · · , k∗} we have

can be more computationally demanding,
for a large T . However, since the AORG optimizes AR se-
quence over an interval, in general, it results in improved
(faster) tracking. Furthermore, optimizing over an interval
enables the AORG, if augmented with detection schemes, to
improve detection performance, which will be discussed in
the following section.

4 Fault Detection and Reconﬁguration

Thus far, we have presented the general formulation of an
AORG. It has been proven that the AORG guarantees con-
straint satisfaction at all times, while ensuring reference
tracking. Following the structure depicted in Fig. 1, in this
section, we integrate the AORG with a detection scheme to
identify the operating mode of the system. We also propose
a reconﬁguration scheme to maintain viability of the system
after recognizing the mode change due to fault occurrence.

Assumption 11 The time between subsequent faults/failures
is large, implying that only one mode change needs to be
considered at a time.

4.1 Detection Unit

In this subsection, we show how AORG can be integrated
with a detection unit to realize the structure shown in Fig.
1. We employ the MMAE [32, 39] as the detection unit. Let
µ be the current mode of the system, and M+
µ be the set of
all successor modes of mode µ. The MMAE involves the
parallel operation of |M+
µ | + 1 Kalman ﬁlters, designed for
systems (A ¯µ + B ¯µ Kµ , B ¯µ Gµ ,C, 0), ∀ ¯µ ∈ {µ} ∪ M+
µ , with
Hω ¯µ and Hξ as the process noise and measurement noise
covariances. In MMAE, the residuals of the Kalman ﬁlters
are used to identify the actual mode of the system. The
general structure of the MMAE is shown in Fig. 2, where
ˆyi(t) is the predicted output of the ith Kalman ﬁlter.

Remark 12 In the MMAE, the actual mode can be identiﬁed
(i.e., the posterior probabilities converge) almost surely [31,
40], if the systems are far apart. The distance between the
systems can be assessed by means of Baram proximity metric
[41] or gap metric [42]. We assume that the Kalman ﬁlters
are designed based upon system models that are sufﬁciently
far apart. This assumption is reasonable, as the feedback
and feedforward gains in (2) can be computed by optimizing
the distance metrics.

Let P ( ˜µ|y(t : t + Td), v(t : t + Td − 1)) be the posterior
(Td ∈ Z≥0
probability 3 of mode
˜µ at
see Remark 19) computed
is called detection time;
[t,t + Td], where
based on data over the time interval

time t + Td

3 Note that the Kalman ﬁlters are designed based upon systems
that are not the ones deﬁned in (3). To emphasize this difference,
we use ˜µ to denote the assumed modes in the design of Kalman
ﬁlters. We also denote the set of these modes by ˜M.

Fig. 2: The general structure of the MMAE deployed in this
paper as the detection unit.

v(t : t + Td − 1) := [v(t)(cid:62), · · · , v(t + Td − 1)(cid:62)](cid:62) ∈ Rp(Td +1)
and y(t : t +Td) := [y(t)(cid:62), · · · , y(t +Td)(cid:62)](cid:62) ∈ Rm(Td +1). Note
that P ( ˜µ|y(t), v(t)) = P( ˜µ), ∀ ˜µ, where P( ˜µ) is a known
prior probability. Then the operating mode can be detected
as the one which maximizes the posterior probability:

ˆµ = arg max

˜µ

P ( ˜µ|y(t : t + Td), v(t : t + Td − 1)) .

(33)

Let the detection objective be the quality of detection mea-
sured by the probability of mode misidentiﬁcation by the de-
tector (33). This objective is a function of the AR sequence
within the interval [t,t + Td], and can be expressed as
Jd(v(t : t + Td − 1)) = E(cid:2)σ ( ˆµ)(cid:3),

(34)

where σ ( ˆµ) is zero when ˆµ determined by (33) is the ac-
tual operating mode of the system (i.e., the actual operat-
ing mode is identiﬁed correctly), and is 1 otherwise. The
following theorem demonstrates that this objective function
can be expressed as an explicit function of the AR sequence
v(t), · · · , v(t + Td − 1).

Theorem 13 Consider the MMAE shown in Fig. 2, and sup-
pose that the AR sequence v(t), · · · , v(t + Td − 1) within the
time interval [t,t + Td] has been speciﬁed. Then, the detec-
tion objective function (34) can be upper bounded by an
explicitly computable function of the AR sequence.

PROOF. The detection objective function (34) can be ex-
pressed [20, 43] as
Jd(·) = E(cid:2)σ ( ˆµ)(cid:12)
=

(cid:12)v(t : t + Td − 1)(cid:3)

(cid:12)v(t : t + Td − 1)(cid:1) dy(t : t + Td), (35)

According to Bayes’ theorem, since 0 ≤ σ ( ˆµ) ≤ 1, and due
to the fact that the probability of the mode ˜µ conditioned

7

by only input data is equal to the a priori probability of the
mode ˜µ, (35) implies that

Following the same arguments as in [44], the right-hand side

can be computed as

computed with matrices of modes ˜µ and ˇµ, respectively.

Note that η ˜µ and η ˇµ are explicit functions of the AR se-
quence v(t), · · · , v(t +Td −1), and it can be easily shown [43]
that ρ ˜µ ˇµ is a quadratic function of this AR sequence. This
completes the proof. (cid:50)

Remark 14 The upper-bound ˆJd(v(t : t + Td − 1)) given
in (37) is,
in general, non-convex in the AR sequence
v(t), · · · , v(t + Td − 1).

bring the system to a safe conﬁguration associated with the
new operating mode, once a mode change is detected. In this
subsection, we design the reconﬁguration scheme. Before
proceeding, we make the following assumption.

Assumption 15 We assume that some of the constraints
can be temporarily relaxed. This assumption is reasonable,
as in practice, constraints are often imposed conservatively
to extend system operating life [30, 45]. In mathematical
terms, by relaxation we mean that E [z1(t|µ)] ∈ Z+
1 and
P (cid:0)z2(t|µ) ∈ Z+
2 ⊃ Z2 are the
extended sets. Also, we assume that this relaxation can last
up to maximum Te ∈ Z≥2 time steps, which is referred to as
the maximum extension time.

(cid:1) ≥ β , where Z+

Let Tr (0 < Tr < Te) be the speciﬁed recovery time, i.e.,
the time within the system should complete the recovery
and enter a safe conﬁguration. Let RTr
µ be a recoverable set
associated with mode µ. This set contains all states that can
be steered into Projx
µ = (cid:8)x(t) : ∃ v(t), · · · , v(t + Tr − 1) such that

where ˆx(k|t, µ), ˆz1(k|t, µ), and ˆz2(k|t, µ) are as in (8). Note
that this recoverable set can be computed once and ofﬂine
for all µ.

Lemma 16 Suppose that at time t, a mode change from µ
to ¯µ is detected, and x(t) ∈ RTr
¯µ . Then, the AR sequence

PROOF. The existence of such AR sequence v(t), · · · , v(t +
Tr − 1) follows from the deﬁnition of the set RTr
¯µ and As-
sumption 11. The AORG scheme can then be utilized to
control the system from time t + Tr onward. (cid:50)

4.2 Reconﬁguration Scheme

4.3 Control Unit

As shown in Fig. 1, a reconﬁguration scheme is employed
in the proposed fault-tolerant constrained control scheme to

In this section, we discuss how to employ the AORG to
generate the AR sequence v(t), · · · , v(t + Td − 1) such that

8

the detection scheme presented in Section 4.1 detects the
fault with high probability of correctness, without breaking
the control objectives, while ensuring a safe recovery upon
detection.

4.3.1 Control During Transient

The following theorem addresses an active fault detection
and control problem based upon the AORG scheme.

Theorem 17 Suppose that µ is the operating mode of
the system at
time t which is the beginning of a de-
tection interval. Let (x(t), v(t − 1)) ∈ Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞,µ , and
(cid:107)v(t − 1) − r(cid:107) > ϑ for some ϑ ∈ R≥0. Suppose that the
AR sequence v(t), · · · , v(t + Td − 1) is computed via the
optimization problem (22) with the following cost function,

ˆz2(i|t, ¯µ, Kµ , Gµ ) ∈ Z+

µ is as in (43), Z+

for all k ∈ {0, 1, · · · , Td} and all ¯µ ∈ M+
µ , where Ω ∈ [0, 1] is
a design parameter that deﬁnes the trade-off between control
performance and detection quality, ˆx(·), ˆz1(·), and ˆz2(·) are
1 and Z+
as in (8), ˆJd(·) is as in (37), RTr
2 are
the extended sets as discussed in Assumption 15, and Td is
the detection time. Then, the AR sequence v(t + i) = v∗
i , i ∈
{0, · · · , Td − 1}, where v∗
i is the optimal solution of the above
problem, results in the relaxed constraints being satisﬁed
within the interval [t,t + Td − 1]. If the operating mode of the
system remains constant over the interval [t,t + Td − 1], the
computed AR sequence results in the constraints (4) being
satisﬁed within the above-mentioned interval.

PROOF. The proof is a straightforward application of The-
orems 7 and 13, Assumptions 11 and 15, and Remarks 19.

Remark 18 Another possible way to pursue both control
and detection aims is to let one of the objective functions to
take arbitrary value up to a known upper limit value, and
then to enforce this as a constraint and minimize the other
objective function. In this paper we only study the convex
combination of two objective functions, as in (45).

Fig. 3: Geometric illustration of the recoverable set and the
maximal output-admissible set.

where Tr is the recovery time as in (43), Te is the extension
time as in Assumption 15, and Td is the detection time.

Remark 20 According to the last constraint in (22) and
the constraint (46), to satisfy the tracking properties the
following condition should hold true for all µ and for all
¯µ ∈ M+
µ :

Projx

˜O∞,µ ⊆ RTr
¯µ .

(50)

See Fig. 3 for a geometric illustration. As discussed in [30],
there are three mutually non exclusive approaches to sat-
isfy this condition: 1) to increase Tr, i.e., increase Te and/or
decrease Td; 2) to reduce Z1 and Z2 (i.e., to tighten con-
straints); and 3) to enlarge Z+
2 (i.e., to further relax
the constraints). Note that when the condition (50) holds,
if the state x(t) does not belong to the recoverable set at
the time of detection due to the random disturbances, the
infeasibility-handling mechanism ensures that the state will
eventually enter the recoverable set.

1 and Z+

Remark 21 Constraints (47) and (48) mean that if the con-
trol law and the AR sequence designed for system µ are ap-
plied to system ¯µ, ˆz1(·) and ˆz2(·) do not exit the extended sets
Z+
1 and Z+
2 , respectively. See Fig. 4 for a geometric illustra-
tion (this ﬁgure shows only the set Z1). There are three mu-
tually non exclusive approaches to satisfy these constraints
(and consequently ensure recursive feasibility): 1) to reduce
1 and Z+
Td; 2) to reduce Z1 and Z2; and 3) to enlarge Z+
2 .

Remark 22 Due to the asymptotic convergence of
the
MMAE, correct identiﬁcation may not be guaranteed for
small Td. Thus, the reconﬁguration scheme may be applied
based upon a misidentiﬁcation. One intuitive way to cope
with this issue is to apply the reconﬁguration scheme if the
mode change is being detected in two consecutive intervals.

Remark 19 As discussed in [31, 39], the MMAE may not
identify the mode change in one interval if it occurs at a time
which is close to the end of the detection interval. Accord-
ing to this fact and Assumption 15, the following condition
should hold true:

Remark 23 The optimization problem outlined in Theorem
17 is, in general, non-convex (see Remark 14). However, its
solution can be computed numerically by means of avail-
able nonlinear programming tools, e.g., bmibnb [46] and
GloptiPoly3 [47].

Tr < Te − 2Td,

(49)

Remark 24 Suppose that the operating mode of the system

9

i , i ∈ {0, · · · , Td − 1}, where v∗

AR sequence v(t + i) = v∗
i is
the optimal solution, results in the relaxed constraints being
satisﬁed within the interval [t,t + Td − 1]. If the operating
mode of the system remains constant over the interval [t,t +
Td − 1], the computed AR sequence results in the constraints
(4) being satisﬁed within the above-mentioned interval.

PROOF. The proof is a straightforward application of The-
orems 7 and 13, Assumptions 11 and 15, and Remarks 19.

Remark 27 The idea of Theorem 26 can be interpreted as
injecting a small perturbation signal to the system in steady-
state to improve detection performance. Note that injecting
a perturbation signal for diagnostics purposes is exploited
in many real-world systems (e.g., [34, 48])

5 Simulation Study

In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme, in this section, we simulate Boeing 747-100 air-
plane, shown in Fig. 5. In this example, the goal is, ﬁrst, to ef-
fectively detect the loss of vertical stabilizer, and then utilize
a differential thrust to maintain airplane lateral/directional
stability. Note that losing vertical stabilizer is a real prob-
lem in commercial airplanes. Notable examples are: 1) Japan
Airlines Flight 123 in 1985, with 520 fatalities, and 2) Amer-
ican Airlines Flight 587 in 2001, with 265 fatalities.

Suppose that Boeing 747-100 airplane is ﬂying at Mach 0.65
(with the corresponding airspeed of 673 [ft/sec]) at 2 × 104
[ft] altitude. Let x = [θr ∆θr θs ∆θy](cid:62) be the state of the
system, where θr is the roll angle, ∆θr is the roll rate, θs
is the side-slip angle, and ∆θy is the yaw rate. The control
input is u = [δa δr δT ](cid:62), where δa is the aileron deﬂection,
δr is the rudder deﬂection, and δT is the differential thrust.
The model of the system with sampling time 0.2 [s] is in
the form of (1), where µ1 and µ2 indicate, respectively, the
fault-free and faulty modes. System matrices can be found
in [49] and [50]. Note that the gap between the fault-free and
faulty systems (computed by the gapmetric function in
MATLAB) is 1, which means that the systems are far apart.

remains unchanged, and r is steady-state admissible. Sup-
pose that we employ the optimization problems mentioned
in Theorem 17 in the following intervals, and we use the
infeasibility-handling mechanism presented in Section 3.2.4.
Then, according to Theorems 8, 9, and 17, it can be shown
that constraints (4) are satisﬁed at all times, and v(t) asymp-
totically converges to r.

Remark 25 Suppose that a fault occurs at a time close to
the end of the interval [t,t +Td]. As mentioned in Remark 19,
the MMAE may not be able to detect the fault at time t + Td.
If (x(t + Td), v(t + Td − 1)) ∈ Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞,µ , the fault will be
detected at the end of the next interval, i.e., at time t +2Td. Or
else, since the infeasibility-handling mechanism presented
in Section 3.2.4 keeps the AR, the posterior probabilities will
go on evolving, and thus the fault will be detected in a few
time steps (< Td) [43].

4.3.2 Control At Steady-State

The following theorem formulates an active fault detection
and control problem at steady-state. Note that discussions in
Remark 19-25 hold true in this case.

Theorem 26 Suppose that µ is the operating mode of the
system at time t which is the beginning of an interval. Let
(x(t), v(t − 1)) ∈ Proj(x,v0) ˜O∞,µ , and (cid:107)v(t − 1) − r(cid:107) ≤ ϑ .
Consider the following optimization problem:

5.1 Effectiveness of the AORG

In order to show the effectiveness of the AORG, we have
run 100 simulations starting from the trim condition, i.e.,
x(0) = [0 0 0 0](cid:62) and v(0) = [0 0](cid:62), and with T = 5. Simu-
lation results are shown in Fig. 6. As seen in this ﬁgure, the
AORG guarantees convergence properties, while constraints
are satisﬁed at all times.

As discussed in Remark 10, the AORG provides a better
solution compared to conventional RGs. This fact is shown
in Fig. 7, where the AORG is employed to compute the AR
over the interval [0, T ]. This ﬁgure reports the mean relative
reference tracking error of 1000 experiments. As seen in this
ﬁgure, compared to the conventional RG, the AR obtained
by the AORG is closer to the desired reference at the end
of the aforementioned interval, i.e., at time T . However, as
T increases, the difference between two schemes reduces.
The main reason is that as time passes, the AR obtained by
either schemes gets closer to the desired reference, which
reduces the relative tracking error.

According to (10), increasing β can be interpreted as tight-
ening the constraint. To study this, we relax the expectation
constraints and we assume that r = [5 2](cid:62). The impact of β
on the convergence error is shown in Fig. 8, obtained from
1000 simulation runs. As seen in this ﬁgure, as the value β
increases, the convergence error increases as well. Also, the
rate of constraint violation is around (1 − β )/2. This result
is expected, as the half of noises should will cause constraint
violation.

5.2 Effectiveness of the Detection Scheme

the detection objective function is not taken into account in
determining the AR sequence, the MMAE can identify the
actual operating mode of the system with 98.7% of correct-
ness when the vertical stabilizer works faultlessly. However,
when the vertical stabilizer fails, the actual operating mode
of the system can be identiﬁed with 58.1% of correctness.

As discussed in Section 4.3.1, considering the detection ob-
jective function in determining the AR sequence can im-
prove the detection performance. This fact can be seen in
Table 1. As reported in this table, by simultaneously con-
sidering the detection and control objective functions, the
MMAE can identify the actual operating mode with 97.6%
of correctness for the fault-free mode, and with 100% for
the faulty mode. Note that the value of the control objec-
tive function (i.e., ∑i ∑ j κ i
j) with considering the detection
objective function is 34.4% less than that of the case where
the detection objective function is not considered.

In this section, we will assess the performance of the AORG
combined with the MMAE discussed in Section 4.3.1 in
identifying the actual operating mode of the system. To do
so, we have run 1000 simulations with Td = 6, and with ran-
dom initial conditions for both fault-free and faulty modes.
Results are reported in Table 1. As seen in this table, when

For comparison purposes, we implement the fault-tolerant
Model Predictive Controller (MPC) described in [22]. As
seen in Table 1, when we use the MPC scheme, the MMAE
can identify the actual operating mode of the system with
83.9% of correctness when the vertical stabilizer works fault-
lessly, and with 72.4% when the vertical stabilizer fails.

two typical initial conditions.

6 Conclusion

The posterior probabilities obtained by the MMAE for two
typical initial conditions are shown in Fig. 9. As seen in Fig.
9, when the initial condition is x(0) = [1 0 1 0](cid:62) and when
the system operates under the fault-free mode, without con-
sidering the detection objective function in determining the
AR sequence, the MMAE does not identify the actual oper-
ating mode of the system. However, by taking into account
the detection objective function, the MMAE identiﬁes the
actual operating mode of the system, though with a low level
of conﬁdence.

5.3 Effectiveness of the Reconﬁguration Scheme

In this section, we will evaluate the effectiveness of the pro-
posed reconﬁguration scheme. Suppose that the vertical sta-
bilizer fails at t = 8. Suppose that Td = 6 and Tr = 13. Sim-
ulation results for 100 experiments starting from the trim
condition are shown in Fig. 10. As seen in this ﬁgure, once
the vertical stabilizer fails and the MMAE detects this fail-
ure, the reconﬁguration schemes gets involved by comput-
ing a AR sequence via Lemma 16. As shown in Fig. 10, the
computed AR sequence can safely recover the tracking and
constraint satisfaction properties.

This paper proposed a fault-tolerant constrained control
scheme. First, a new RG-based constrained control scheme,
called AORG, was presented. The main feature of this
scheme is that it computes the AR sequence for an interval
entirely at the beginning of the interval. It’s convergence
and constraint-handling properties are proven rigorously.
The AORG was combined with the MMAE which was used
to detect the fault. It was shown that the AR sequence can
be determined such that the detection performance is opti-
mized, while enforcing constraints satisfaction at all times
and ensuring reference tracking. Finally, a reconﬁguration
scheme based on recoverable sets was presented, which can
maintain system viability and functionality despite the pres-
ence of the fault. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme
is validated through extensive simulation studies carried out
on Boeing 747-100. As future work, we plan to extend our
method to deal with non-Gaussian and possibly correlated
noise.

Baruah and A. Burns Journal of Systems Architecture 109 (2020) 101755 for the development of survivable implementations of a simple mixed- critical system under two diﬀerent mixed-criticality scheduling algo- rithms: MCF, which is based upon an idealized ﬂuid-scheduling model and EDF-VD, which is EDF-based and hence more realistic. However, we are not claiming that our quantitative metrics are the only ones (or even the best ones) that can be deﬁned. We believe the choice of met- rics is an inherently social process in that buy-in from a larger research community is needed if the metrics are to be widely adopted –we hope that our research eﬀorts, as reported in this paper, here will spur some discussion on the choice of metrics for robustness and resilience, and perhaps yield alternative proposals for metrics. As future work, we plan to revisit some mixed-criticality schedul- ing algorithms such as the ones in [16–19] that have previously been proposed for addressing the non-survivability of traditional mixed- criticality scheduling algorithms. We will seek to characterize the ro- bustness and resilience properties of these algorithms using the metrics that we have proposed in this paper. Declaration of Competing Interest None.
