ABSTRACT

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) play a decisive role in driving space weather, especially, the fast ones (e.g.,
with speeds above 800 km s−1). Understanding the trigger mechanisms of fast CMEs can help us gaining
important information in forecasting them. The ﬁlament eruptions accompanied with CMEs provide a good
tracer in studying the early evolution of CMEs. Here we surveyed 66 ﬁlament-accompanied fast CMEs to
analyse the correlation between the trigger mechanisms, namely either magnetic reconnection or ideal MHD
process, associated ﬂares, and CME speeds. Based on the data gathering from SDO, GONG and STEREO, we
ﬁnd that: (1) Active region (AR) ﬁlament and intermediate ﬁlaments (IFs) eruptions show a higher probability
for producing fast CMEs than quiet Sun (QS) ﬁlaments, while the probability of polar crown (PC) ﬁlament
eruptions is zero in our statistic; (2) AR ﬁlament eruptions that produce fast CMEs are more likely triggered by
magnetic reconnection, while QS and IFs are more likely triggered by ideal MHD process; (3) For AR ﬁlaments
and IFs, it seems that the speciﬁc trigger mechanism does not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the resulted CME
speeds, while for the QS ﬁlaments, the ideal MHD mechanism can more likely generate a faster CME; (4)
Comparing with previous statistic study, the onset heights of ﬁlament eruptions and the decay indexes of the
overlying ﬁeld show some differences: for AR ﬁlaments and IFs, the decay indexes are larger and much closer
to the theoretical threshold, while for QS ﬁlaments, the onset heights are higher than those obtained in previous
results.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are the most vio-
lent, eruptive phenomenon on the Sun, can throws out over
1012 − 1013 kg of magnetized plasma into the interplane-
tary (Jackson 1985; Gopalswamy & Kundu 1992; Hudson et
al. 1996). The very high-speed CMEs, if direct to the Earth,
can cause strong geomagnetic storms and severely threaten
space weather (Tsurutani et al. 1988; Gonzalez et al. 1999;
Huttunen et al. 2002, 2005; Liu et al. 2014). To avoid such
disaster caused by them, prediction of CMEs, especially the
fast ones, is an important topic in space weather research
(Singer et al. 2001; Schwenn et al. 2005), Particularly, it is
crucial to investigate the pre-eruptive conditions and the trig-
ger mechanisms of CMEs for a reliable prediction.

CMEs originates from the solar corona, and are often ac-
companied with other activities, such as ﬂares and ﬁlament
eruptions (Harrison 1995; Yashiro et al. 2005; Wang & Zhang
2007; Gopalswamy et al. 2003; Jing et al. 2004). Now it
is commonly believed that these eruptive phenomena are all

driven by the evolution of solar coronal magnetic ﬁeld, which
suddenly released its free energy through eruptions. In order
to understand how the eruptions are triggered, many theoret-
ical models have been proposed (Sakurai 1976; van Balle-
gooijen & Martens 1989; Antiochos et al. 1999; Chen & Shi-
bata 2000; Moore et al. 2001; To¨rök & Kliem 2005; Kliem
& To¨rök 2006; Aulanier et al. 2010), which can roughly be
divided into two categories: one is based on magnetic re-
connection, and the other is via ideal MHD process (Sakurai
1976; To¨rök & Kliem 2005; Kliem & To¨rök 2006; Aulanier
et al. 2010). The reconnection mechanisms, including mainly
the tether-cutting model (Moore et al. 2001) and break-out
model (Antiochos et al. 1999), consider that magnetic recon-
nection plays a fundamental role in producing the eruption of
magnetic structures. The tether-cutting model suggests that
reconnection within sheared magnetic arcades can break the
balance between the outward magnetic pressure force and the
inward magnetic tension of the overlying ﬁeld (Moore et al.
2001). It describes the situation that two magnetic arcades
get close to each other via photospheric shearing and con-
verging ﬂows. When the sheared arcades are close enough,
magnetic reconnection will take place to build up a magnetic
ﬂux rope (MFR) or even trigger an eruption. This model has

been well studied during last decades, as numerous observa-
tions have shown shearing and converging ﬂows a few hours
or minutes before triggering of ﬂares and CMEs (Wang et
al. 2005; Liu et al. 2013; Shimizu et al. 2014). And ac-
companied magnetic cancellations and increasing radiations
indicate that magnetic reconnection takes place and ﬁnally
triggers the eruptions (Leka et al. 1996; Sterling et al. 2010).
Note that the reconnection is within the core structure. On the
other hand, the break-out model proposes that reconnection
above the sheared arcades can do the same work by weaken-
ing the overlying ﬁeld (Antiochos et al. 1999). Such process
studied by simulations is also consistent with observations
(Lynch et al. 2004). Based on coronal magnetic ﬁeld ex-
trapolations, it is demonstrated that this model can explain
observations of CMEs (Zhou et al. 2017). Unlike the tether-
cutting model, there are fewer precursors that can be ob-
served for this model (Sterling & Moore 2001a). Besides,
magnetic ﬂux emergence and its associated magnetic recon-
nection are also proposed as being the trigger of eruption.
For example, Chen & Shibata (2000) proposed a model in
which the emergence ﬂux inside or outside the core structure
(a MFR) can trigger its eruption, i.e., an inside emerging ﬂux
can cause converging ﬂow underneath the MFR and then trig-
ger reconnection, while an outside emerging ﬂux can weaken
the overlying ﬁeld via reconnection. Note that all these men-
tioned models are based magnetic reconnection. The ideal
MHD models believe that the eruptions can be triggered and
accelerated by the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in-
stabilities, such as kink instability and torus instability asso-
ciated with twisted magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) (Sakurai 1976;
To¨rök & Kliem 2005; Kliem & To¨rök 2006; Aulanier et al.
2010).
In such models, the magnetic reconnection is trig-
gered as a result of the eruptions. The simulation of Aulanier
et al. (2010) suggests that the ideal MHD instability plays a
more important role in forming CMEs. And in the investi-
gation of the strongest ﬂare in 24 solar cycle by Yang et al.
(2017), they think the associated CME was ﬁrstly caused by
the kink instability of the ﬁlament embedded in.

Although there are numerous studies on the early evolu-
tion of CMEs, only a few of them focus on quiescent ﬁlament
eruption. Basing on previous studies we can know that they
are not so different from the AR eruptions. They can have
similar evolve processes, reach a high enough speed or as-
sociated with a double-ribbon ﬂare. However, some studies
found that the accompanied ﬂares have some delay with the
eruption onset (Sterling & Moore 2001b). It seems the recon-
nection is the result of the eruption, just like the description
of those eruptions triggered by idea MHD instabilities. And
Zhou et al. (2006) and Su et al. (2015) are conﬁrmed these
instabilities, such as kink instability and torus instability, can
trigger eruptions of quiescent ﬁlaments.

Filaments, or prominences when seen above the solar limb,
are fascinating objects embedded in the solar corona. They
are rougly 100 times denser than the surrounding corona
but 100 times colder.
In order to sustain such heavy ma-
terials, special magnetic structures are needed to provide
upward magnetic tension force, for example, the magnetic
dips within MFRs (Kippenhahn & Schluter 1957; Kuperus
& Raadu 1974). Since ﬁlament eruptions can be well ob-
served by multi-wavelength, such as Hα, 304Å, 193Åand
211Å, once the MFR holding a ﬁlament becomes unsta-
ble and erupts, the erupting ﬁlament as observed provides
a tracer of the dynamic evolution of the underlying mag-
netic structure. Furthermore, many statistical studies have
shown that the occurence of ﬁlament eruptions are strongly
related with that of CMEs (Gopalswamy et al. 2003; Jing et
al. 2004; Chen 2011), and the erupting ﬁlament materials are
recognized in most cases as the bright core of typical CMEs.
Thus observation of the ﬁlament eruptions provides the key
in studying the early kinetic evolution of CMEs.

Regarding to the triggering mechanisms by either recon-
nection or ideal MHD, the ﬁlament eruptions should behave
rather differently in observations. For reconnection-triggered
ones, their eruptions should be preceded by a strong enhance-
ment of X-ray (as well as EUV) intensity close to or on the
ﬁlament spine. For ideal MHD process, the intensity en-
hancement or X-ray ﬂux increasing will occur a bit after its
eruption. Thus for typical events, the triggers can be eas-
ily distinguished. In their evolutions, the idea MHD process
can always provide a clear trajectory of erupting ﬁlament
(Cheng et al. 2013), which can be used to study its acceler-
ation. While for reconnection process, more precursors can
be observed in photospheric magnetic ﬁeld, such as emerging
parasitic poles or conversion ﬂows (Feynman & Martin 1995;
Jing et al. 2004). These precursors are helpful in predicting
its trigger.

The Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK, Hurlburt
et al. 2012), which is a catalog of the records of solar ac-
tivities, including the ﬁlament eruption records from 2011 to
now. Using the records, some statistical studies discussed the
relationship between eruptive ﬁlaments and formed CMEs.
For example, McCauley et al. (2015) surveyed some proper-
ties of more than 900 ﬁlament eruptions recorded by HEK.
Among them, more than 100 limb events are analyzed for
studying their onset radial height and decay index. It is found
that the onset heights show a signiﬁcant difference in differ-
ent ﬁlament types. On the other hand, the differences for
decay indexes are not so signiﬁcant. The decay indexes have
an average value of 1.1 for all the ﬁlament, with the quies-
cent type slightly higher and the active region type slightly
lower. For the eruptive ﬁlaments, some of them can form
the CMEs and some of them failed. Jing et al. (2018) stud-
ied 38 eruption events that are associated with ﬂares stronger

than M5 class. They found that all the core magnetic struc-
tures of conﬁned events are underneath the height with decay
index equal 0.8. But the eruptive ones do not show a well-
deﬁned threshold, e.g., they can occur with decay index even
smaller than 0.8. Although, it is concluded that reconnection
solely seems not able to strong enough for ejecting a CME in
the study of Aulanier et al. (2010), the statistical result sug-
gests that reconnection can break out the constrain of strong
overlying magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., the eruptive events with decay
index smaller than 0.8 are triggered by reconnection. Thus a
survey of the triggering mechanisms of ﬁlament eruptions is
required to provide new insights for this topic.

In this paper, we carried out a statistical study to identify
the triggering mechanisms for ﬁlament eruptions with focus
on those resulting in high-speed CMEs. We will statistically
analyse the relationships among CME velocities, ﬁlament
types, trigger mechanism and some magnetic properties. The
ﬁrst part (Section 2) will introduce the data, standards in di-
viding the events and methods in calculating the magnetic
properties. Second part (Section 3) will gather the results of
the statistical properties. The last part (Section 4) will sum-
marize our ﬁndings.

2. DATA AND METHOD

The ﬁlament eruption samples are obtained from HEK.
Here we ﬁrst selected the signiﬁcantly high-speed CME
events (velocity > 800 km s−1 which is larger than the speed
of fast solar wind) in time span from June 1 2011 to June
1 2017 and identiﬁed their origin sites. Then, only the
CMEs which are accompanied with ﬁlament eruptions are
conﬁrmed as the samples. A total number of 87 events are
selected from over 400 CMEs. Among these 87 events, some
of them took place behind the solar disk and a few of them are
hardly to be traced for their trajectory. As such, we discarded
these events since they will cause errors in identifying their
ﬂare class and onset time. After this ﬁltering, we ﬁnally ob-
tained 66 events for statistic study. All of their eruption evo-
lutions can be observed by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Ob-
servatory (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012). Furthermore, in order
to gain the accurate position information of the pre-eruptive
ﬁlaments, 195 Å images taken by Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory (STEREO, Howard 2008) are also used. All the
events are listed in Table 1.

2.1. Filament types

Filaments (or prominences) distribute in the whole solar
disc, including the polar regions as well as the equator (En-
gvold 2015). They are often grouped in four types according
to their locations. Active region (AR) ﬁlaments form in ARs.
Quiet Sun (QS) ﬁlaments are located in quiet sun regions far
away from ARs. There are also intermediate ﬁlaments (IF)

that have one leg rooted in AR and the other one rooted in
quiet sun region, or lie between neighboring ARs. Filaments
found at the polar regions, e.g., at latitudes larger than 50◦,
are called polar crown (PC) ﬁlaments. Different types of ﬁl-
aments can have different physical properties, e.g., magnetic
conﬁgurations and strength. Thus dividing the samples by
ﬁlament types can help us clarifying the important factors
that affect their eruption. A typical ﬁlament for each type
is shown in Figure 1, and the statistical numbers are given
in Figure 2. Note that there is no PC ﬁlament in our statis-
tic samples, probably due to the fact that the weak magnetic
ﬁeld strength in high latitude is unable to produce fast CMEs.

2.2. Time-distance evolutions

Time-distance maps provide the kinetic information of a
drifting object with time. It is widely used in tracing erup-
tive events, such as jets, ﬂares and ﬁlament eruptions. In a
majority of the cases, a straight line pointing along the erup-
tion direction can fully cover the evolution trajectory of an
erupting ﬁlament. However, for a few events, the trajectories
are not along a straight line. In such cases, we select 4 or
5 frames during the eruption and mark the front of eruption
by hand. Then a conic is used to ﬁt all the mark points. In
order to cover the whole trajectory of eruptions, we extended
this conic from the footpoint to the front until it moves out
of the view. Figure 3 shows one of the events analyzed for
time-distance evolution. The upper panels show the selected
frames, where the marks are shown by the green diamonds.
The yellow dashed line shows the location for picking up the
slice. The bottom panel displays the time-distance map along
the yellow dashed line.

Evolution of an erupting ﬁlament often demonstrates two
distinct phases: a slow-rise phase and a fast-rise phase. The
slow-rise phase can be recognized as the upward motion with
a constant and small velocity (Sterling & Moore 2005), while
the fast-rise phase can be ﬁtted with an exponential function
(Goff et al. 2005; Williams 2005). In order to ﬁt these two
phases with a single curve, we use the function proposed by
Cheng et al. (2013):

h (t) = c0e(t−t0)/τ + c1 (t − t0) + c2,

(1)

where h(t) is the height of ﬁlament, t is the time and c0, c1,
c2, t0 and τ are free parameters. With this function, we can
calculate conveniently the eruption onset time (McCauley et
al. 2015), which is deﬁned by

tonset = τ ln (cid:0)c1τ /c0

(cid:1) + t0.

(2)

It means the instantaneous velocity at the onset time is twice
of the initial value, i.e., the constant speed in the slow-rise
phase. In the bottom panel of Figure 3, we denote the onset
time using a cyan dashed line. This function can well ﬁt some

celerated rather abruptly. As an example shown in Figure 5,
the initiation of such reconnection-triggered events are ac-
companied with strong EUV intensity enhancement, and in
these cases, the trajectory of erupting ﬁlaments is similar, i.e.,
starting with an almost static or extremely slow rise phase,
then followed by a rapid acceleration immediately after the
intensity enhancement, and ﬁnally reaching a constant veloc-
ity. We have attempted to deﬁne their onset time using the
aforementioned method but failed, because as shown in Fig-
ure 5 some of their acceleration phases are covered by the
strong radiations. Besides, there are also some fast acceler-
ated eruptions which cannot be ﬁtted well by an exponential
curve. For example, see such an event shown in Figure 6.
This event includes 4 phases during its eruption. The ﬁrst
phase was a very slow rise phase (nearly undetectable), then
it was most probably triggered by a reconnection (see the in-
tensity enhancements underneath the ﬁlament). After a short
acceleration, it ejected with nearly constant speed. Several
minutes later, it seems to be accelerated again, but mean-
while was split into three parts. Then all these parts show

uniform velocities. The cases with such complex trajectories
can hardly be deﬁned with an onset time using the aforemen-
tioned method. Thus, for all these cases, we deﬁne the erup-
tion onset time as beginning of the intensity enhancement,
i.e., the same onset time of ﬂare reconnection. Since in these
cases, the ﬁlaments are almost static before eruption and the
accelerations are so rapid, there is no signiﬁcant uncertainty
brought in calculating its onset height.

2.3. Onset height and decay index

It has been suggested that ideal MHD instabilities play an
important role in triggering ﬁlament eruptions. In particu-
lar, the torus instability has been proposed to be the most
important one for producing CMEs. For an ideal MFR con-
ﬁguration, the torus instability is determined by the decay
index, which describes the decreasing speed (with height) of
background magnetic ﬁeld overlying the MFR. Speciﬁcally,
the MFR system becomes unstable when the apex of the
rope axis reaches a height where the decay index exceeds a
threshold value (To¨rök & Kliem 2005; Kliem & To¨rök 2006).
Thus it is meaningful to calculate the onset height of eruption
prominence, and derive the decay index at this height.

Joint observations of STEREO and SDO are used to obtain
the onset height. Figures 8 and 9 show two examples of eval-
uating the onset height. First, we use a diamond to mark the
body of prominence and then trace the latitude to mark the
same position of ﬁlament in STEREO. This new mark can
tell us the longitude of the ﬁlament, and associated with the
relative position of STEREO and SDO, we can get the longi-
tude and latitude of the prominence observed in SDO. Thus

the position and height of prominence can be derived. How-
ever, this method can be used only for those prominences ob-
served in both SDO and STEREO, while some events do not
have STEREO observations with an appropriate angle. For
prominences (above the limb) of these events, we calculate
their radial height projected to the plane-to-sky. For radial
eruptive ﬁlaments (onboard the disc), we can calculate the
distance between ﬁlament spine and footspoints and project
it back to 3D space. Even so, there are still 8 events (3 AR
ﬁlaments, 2 IF ﬁlaments and 3 QS ﬁlaments) for which the
onset height cannot be determined.

After evaluating the onset height of ﬁlaments, we can cal-
culate the decay index n, which is deﬁned as n = −∂lnB/∂lnh,
at their onset height h. The magnetic ﬁeld B is obtained by
PFSS extrapolation from the magnetogram taken by Global
Oscillation Network Group (GONG, Harvey 2011), and only
the transverse component is used in the calculation.

2.4. Trigger mechanism

The trigger mechanisms of ﬁlament eruption, which have
been introduced in Section 1, are classiﬁed into two types:
reconnection and ideal MHD processes. Combining the soft
X-ray ﬂux, the time-distance map and the observations at on-
set time, we can distinguish which mechanism works in a
ﬁlament eruption: for the reconnection-triggered events, the
increase of soft X-ray ﬂux, which corresponds to beginning
of the associated ﬂare, should be observed just ahead of the
eruption onset time, and newly-formed ﬂare ribbons or en-
hancements of emission intensity should be observed at the
footpoints or spine of the erupting ﬁlament. In our events,

some of them can unambiguously identiﬁed as being trig-
gered by reconnection because the ﬂare emission enhance-
ments occur clearly before the onset of the fast rise eruption,
for instance, see the sample shown in Figure 6. Two more
samples of reconnection-triggered events are shown in Fig-
ure 5. Along with their time-distance maps, the observations
at onset time are also exhibited. It can be seen that at on-
set time, both of their X-ray ﬂux increased and the intensity
enhancements can be seen in footpoint (panel c) and spine
(panel d) of ﬁlament. On the contrary, a typical sample of
eruptions triggered by non-reconnection processes are shown
in Figure 7. It shows that there is no signiﬁcant X-ray ﬂux
increasing before and at onset time and no signiﬁcant radia-
tive enhancements along the ﬁlament. Indeed, the associated
ﬂare ribbons appear almost one hour after the onset time of
the ﬁlament eruption (see the last panel).

There are also some events which are difﬁcult to determine
the trigger mechanism using the above method, and we give

cautions for such cases. For example, in Figure 8, we present
a QS prominence eruption event which appears to be trig-
gered by reconnection but is actually not. The time-distance
map shows that the GOES soft X-ray ﬂux increased slightly
before the eruption onset time (which is denoted by the verti-
cal dashed line in panel a). However, by checking the 195 Å
images taken by STEREO B, we ﬁnd no ﬂare ribbons or even
no intensity enhancements associated with this eruption. We
thus further examined the causes of the X-ray ﬂux increasing
and found that it was actually caused by an X1.4 ﬂare occurs
at an AR, NOAA 11520. Thus this event should be consid-
ered as triggered by ideal MHD process. For comparison, we
also show a sample which have a similar situation, i.e., there
is a small GOES emission increasing before the onset time
of eruption (see Figure 9). At this time, there are no ﬂares
occurred in other active regions. Furthermore, from the ob-
servation of STEREO A, we ﬁnd that underneath the erupting
ﬁlament, there can obviously be seen the newly formed ﬂare

ribbons, suggestion that this ﬂare is accompanied with the
ﬁlament eruption. Thus this eruption can be considered as
being caused by reconnection.

However, some studies suggest that although the reconnec-
tion is observed prior to the onset time, it is still hard to say
which mechanism is the trigger as the signatures of recon-
nection often coincides very closely to the onset of fast rising
phase. Furthermore, even the reconnection begins well be-
fore the eruption, there is doubt that such reconnection is not
a trigger, but an approach gradually building up the MFR to
the state of loss of equilibrium or MHD instability (Vrsnak
1990, 2008; Aulanier et al. 2010). Thus we checked our
reconnection-triggered events with more evidences by study-
ing the decay index as well as the magnetic topology of their
soure regions. Firstly, the events for which the onset heights
are far below the torus instability threshold are not likely trig-
gered by torus instability. For the other events whose decay
indexes are close to or even above the torus instability thresh-
old (as listed in Table 1), the uncertainty on the trigger mech-
anism might be large since torus instability is also an option.
However, as shown by their time-distance maps (e.g., Fig-
ure 6), we ﬁnd the ﬁlaments are almost static without any ris-
ing motion before the reconnection occurs, and then they are
strongly accelerated immediately after the reconnection on-
set. This means the reconnection is the key factor in breaking
the equilibriums. Thus in such cases, it is more reasonable
to consider that the eruptions are triggered by reconnection
rather than torus instability. Furthermore, we checked the
magnetic environments of the source region of these erup-
tions by analysing the photospheric magetic ﬂux distribution.
It is believed that reconnection-triggered event is more likely
to occur in complex magnetic topology than in the simple
bipole ﬁeld. For example, Moore & Sterling (2006) present
three scenarios for reconnection-triggered eruptions under
quadrupolar conﬁguration. Consistently, we ﬁnd that in our
studied events, more than two thirds of the reconnection-
triggered ones occurred in complex magnetic environments,
e.g., a multipolar magnetic conﬁguration. While for the non-
reconnection triggered ones, more than two thirds occurred
in simpler environment such as bipole ﬁeld or the edge of
ARs. Finally, it should be noted that there are events in which
both reconnection and torus instability contribute to produce
the eruption, as the reconnection ﬁrst plays a role of trigger
and shortly afterwards the torus instability sets in and further
accelerates the ﬁlament.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Here we summarize the results found basing on the data

and analysis methods described in Section 2:

First, as shown in Figure 2, our statistic events includes
24 AR ﬁlaments, 11 IFs and 31 QS ﬁlaments but no PC ﬁl-
aments. In the statistical analysis of McCauley et al. (2015),

they mentioned that there are 19.6% AR ﬁlaments, 14.1%
IFs, 51.3% QS ﬁlaments and 15% PC ﬁlaments. The dif-
ference in type ratios of our events with theirs suggests that
high-speed CMEs result from AR ﬁlaments and IFs more fre-
quently than QS and PC ﬁlaments. This is rather natural since
the fast CMEs need more free magnetic energy (and stronger
magnetic ﬁeld) for large acceleration. It is worthy noting that
there are still near 50% fast CMEs formed by eruptive QS
ﬁlaments, which is more than that results from AR ﬁlaments.
This indicates that the conversion ratio of free magnetic en-
ergy to CME’s kinetic energy also plays an important role
in determining CME acceleration. Such a conversion rate is
probably related to magnetic environment of the eruptive ﬁl-
ament. However, to determine this factor, one needs more
comparative studies between eruptive AR ﬁlaments and QS
ﬁlaments.

Second, as shown again in Figure 2, the eruptions trig-
gered by reconnection are 62.5% for AR ﬁlaments, 36.4%
for IFs and 16.1% for QS ﬁlaments. It shows that AR ﬁl-
ament eruptions are preferred to be triggered by reconnec-
tion. The IF eruptions have a similar ratio between the re-
connection and ideal-MHD triggers. On the other hand, the
majority of the QS ﬁlament eruptions are triggered by ideal
MHD mechanism, with only 5 events triggered by reconnec-
tion. It is commonly believed that due to the weak magnetic
ﬁeld, reconnection in QS area can hardly trigger a typical
QS ﬁlament eruption with a large amount of mass. Thus
we carefully check the movie of these 5 events to see why
they are triggered by reconnection. We ﬁnd that four of them
(FE2012-05-11, FE2014-04-18, FE2015-04-04 and FE2015-
08-23) are located at or close to the small poles which are not
recognized as an active region, and the ﬁlaments are small as
typical AR ones. It means they have a similar magnetic envi-
ronment with relatively small AR ﬁlaments, thus the recon-
nection process are reasonable. Furthermore, the remaining
one of the 5 events is triggered by an X-class ﬂare in an AR
which shows a very strange ﬂare ribbons (FE2014-12-20).
Its ribbons extend out of the AR and trigger the reconnec-
tion far away from the AR, then lead to the eruption of the
QS ﬁlament. This is probably due to the complex magnetic
environment there.

Third, the velocities of CMEs behave very differently be-
tween different ﬁlament types. As shown in Table 3, the aver-
age velocity of AR-ﬁlament formed CMEs is 1285.00 km s−1,
which is about 1.14 times of IF eruptions and 1.39 times of
QS ﬁlament eruptions. This result for the fast CMEs dif-
fers signiﬁcantly from the one summarized for all eruptions
by McCauley et al. (2015). Unlike their results, the fast
CMEs are prefer to be formed by AR ﬁlaments but not IFs. It
means that magnetic strength plays an important role in ac-
celeration of CME for the formation of fast CMEs, which
is in agreement with the studies of some authors (Qiu &

** bracket: the statistical results ignored the abnormal event.

Yurchyshyn 2005; Chen 2006). On the other hand, the trig-
ger mechanisms, which are supposed to determine the ini-
tial acceleration of CMEs, i.e., the reconnection-triggered
events always experience a impulsive and short acceleration
phase and then evolve with a stable velocity, while the non-
reconnection ones often show an exponential rising proﬁle
as described by Equation 1, play a less important role in
determining the ﬁnal velocity of CMEs. As can be seen,
for whole data set, the average velocity of reconnection-
triggered events is 1196.00 km s−1 and for non-reconnection
events is 1022.74 km s−1, respectively. Interestingly, the av-
erage CMEs velocity of reconnection-triggered QS ﬁlament
eruptions (843.60 km s−1), is obviously smaller than those
triggered by non-reconnection processes (932.04 km s−1).
This indicates that in weaker magnetic environment, the ef-
ﬁciency of acceleration via ideal MHD instability is higher
than that via reconnection. For QS ﬁlaments and IFs, it seems
the average velocities also have a big difference between re-
connection triggered and non-reconnection triggered. But we
ﬁnd that there is one sample that diverges obviously from
other samples in both two sets (FE2012-01-23 and FE2012-
01-27), thus we also show the average velocities excluding
these events in Table 3 with brackets. After excluding these
two events, the difference is signiﬁcantly reduced.

In previous works, the class of associated ﬂares are also
considered to be an important factor in accelerating the CME
velocity (Hundhausen 1997; Yashiro et al. 2002; Vrsnak et al.
2005). Here we also analyse the relationship between CME
velocities and associated ﬂares. There are only 2 X-class
ﬂares and they are associated with the CMEs with highest
velocities of above 2000 km s−1. There are 12 M-class ﬂares

events, and 10 are associated with AR ﬁlaments eruptions
and 2 with IFs. There are 20 events associated with C-class
ﬂares, 9 of them are AR ﬁlament eruption, 5 of them are IFs
and 6 of them are QS events. 27 events of the rest are associ-
ated with B-class ﬂares or even weaker ﬂare signal, 2 events
have no record of GOES ﬂux and 3 events covered by other
ﬂares. The average velocity of CMEs associated is 1300.58
km s−1 for M-class ﬂares, 1046.42 km s−1 for C-class, and
956.08 km s−1 for B-class and below. Previously, Vrsnak et
al. (2005) noticed that the CMEs associated with larger ﬂares
are generally faster and broader than those with small ﬂares.
Similar result is also found by Bein et al. (2012). Here we
provide a more detailed evidence.

Last, the onset height and decay index are shown in Ta-
ble 4. In order to clarify the effects of trigger mechanisms,
we also divide them in two sets, i.e., reconnection and non-
reconnection. Since there are only 2 events of reconnection-
triggered QS ﬁlaments for which the onset height can be eval-
uated, thus they are ignored. It is found that the onset heights
of AR ﬁlaments are close to the results of McCauley et al.
(2015), but for the IFs and QS ﬁlaments, they are a bit higher.
Interestingly, the decay indexes for different types behaves
oppositely from McCauley et al. (2015)’s results, i.e., here
the values for the AR ﬁlaments and IFs are higher while for
the QS ﬁlaments they are close to McCauley et al. (2015)’s
results. The higher decay index and the same onset height
for AR ﬁlaments seems to imply that torus instability play a
more important role in accelerating faster CMEs than in trig-
gering the eruption. Furthermore, the average onset height
(and also the decay index) of reconnection triggered AR ﬁl-
aments is a bit lower than that of non-reconnection triggered

ones. However, the most signiﬁcant difference from Mc-
Cauley et al. (2015)’s results is that the minimum decay index
of reconnection-triggered ones are obviously lower. Indeed,
we ﬁnd the minimum decay index of non-reconnection sam-
ples are higher than 1, but for reconnection ones, the mini-
mum is 0.4. Interestingly, the eruption with such low decay
index is associated with a rather strong ﬂare, i.e., an X4.9
class ﬂare. Also, there are 36% samples have a decay index
smaller than 1. We think it may explain the results summa-
rized by Jing et al. (2018), i.e., strong enough reconnection
can help magnetic structures break out the constrain of back
ground ﬁeld. But these differences are not found in IFs. Any-
way, one should bear in mind that both of the onset heights
and decay indexes have big uncertainties from direct observa-
tions. For prominences, we can get the onset heights reliably
but to calculate the decay index, we can only use the magne-
togram observed days before or after the eruption when the
source region is observed on the solar disk. Similarly, for
ﬁlaments, although the magnetogram are more accurate, the
onset heights are less certain. Thus from this result we can-
not make any strong conclusion, and a more meticulous work
with more samples is needed.

4. SUMMARY

In this paper, by joint observations of SDO, STEREO
GONG and GOES, we surveyed the eruption trigger mech-
anism for ﬁlaments that produced fast CMEs with velocity
above 800 km s−1 observed from 2011 to 2017. The results
of our statistical analysis can be summarized as follows:

(1) AR ﬁlament and IF eruptions show a higher probability
for producing fast CMEs than QS ﬁlaments, while there is no
PC ﬁlament eruptions producing fast CMEs in our statistic.
This imply that stronger magnetic ﬁeld can generate a fast
CME more easily.

(2) The trigger mechanism show a signiﬁcant difference
between AR and QS ﬁlaments, i.e., AR ﬁlament eruptions

prefer to be triggered by reconnection while QS ﬁlament
eruptions prefer to be triggered by non-reconnection process.
(3) The trigger mechanisms do not result in a signiﬁcant
difference in the CME speeds, except for QS ﬁlament erup-
tions, in which non-reconnection process can more likely
generate a faster CME.

(4) Our statistic shows a trend that stronger ﬂares are more
likely associated with faster CMEs. This result is well in
agreement with the previous results.

(5) The onset heights and decay indexes show differences
from previous statistical works. It shows that torus instability
may contribute more in accelerating faster CMEs. We also
note that strong enough reconnection can break out the con-
strain of background ﬁeld. However, due to the uncertainty
of computing the onset heights and decay indexes, further
works are needed for reconﬁrm this conclusion.

In summary, we ﬁnd that QS ﬁlament eruptions still have
a big enough ratio in leading to a faster CME, and they can
transport free magnetic energy into kinetic energy of CMEs
with higher efﬁciency. Thus, it is necessary to pay more at-
tention in studying activities located in QS area for space
weather forecast. The trigger mechanisms play further im-
portant roles in eruptive events. They show different behav-
iors in QS and AR ﬁlaments. For predicting an AR ﬁlament
eruption, more attentions should be paid on the reconnection
precursors, since the reconnection can trigger a fast eruption
regardless the twist number (Jing et al. 2018) or even overly-
ing magnetic ﬁeld. But for QS ﬁlaments, more attention on
overlying constrained ﬁeld should be paid, since few recon-
nection events can lead a faster CME.
