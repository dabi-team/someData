The elucidation of fundamental mechanisms underlying ion-induced radiation damage of biological
systems is crucial for advancing radiotherapy with ion beams and for radiation protection in space.
The study of ion-induced biodamage using the phenomenon-based MultiScale Approach to the
physics of radiation damage with ions (MSA) has led to the prediction of nanoscale shock waves
created by ions in a biological medium at the high linear energy transfer (LET). The high-LET
regime corresponds to the keV and higher energy losses by ions per nanometer, which is typical
for ions heavier than carbon at the Bragg peak region in biological media. This paper reveals that
the thermomechanical stress of the DNA molecule caused by the ion-induced shock wave becomes
the dominant mechanism of complex DNA damage at the high-LET ion irradiation. Damage of
the DNA molecule in water caused by a projectile ion induced shock wave is studied by means of
reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Five projectile ions (carbon, oxygen, silicon, argon and
iron) at the Bragg peak energies are considered. For the chosen segment of the DNA molecule
and the collision geometry, the number of DNA strand breaks is evaluated for each projectile ion
as a function of the bond dissociation energy and the distance from the ion’s path to the DNA
strands. Simulations reveal that argon and especially iron ions induce the breakage of multiple
bonds in a DNA double convolution containing 20 DNA base pairs. The DNA damage produced
in segments of such size leads to complex irreparable lesions in a cell. This makes the shock wave
induced thermomechanical stress the dominant mechanism of complex DNA damage at the high-
LET ion irradiation. A detailed theory for evaluating the DNA damage caused by ions at high-LET
is formulated and integrated into the MSA formalism. The theoretical analysis reveals that a
single ion hitting a cell nucleus at high-LET is suﬃcient to produce highly complex, lethal damages
to a cell by the shock wave induced thermomechanical stress. Accounting for the shock wave
induced thermomechanical mechanism of DNA damage provides an explanation for the “overkill”
eﬀect observed experimentally in the dependence of cell survival probabilities on the radiation dose
delivered with iron ions. This important observation provides strong experimental evidence of the
ion-induced shock wave eﬀect and the related mechanism of radiation damage in cells.

INTRODUCTION

Experimental, theoretical and computational studies of radiation- and collision-induced processes with biomolecular
systems are highly relevant nowadays in connection with the molecular-level assessment of biological damage induced
by ionizing radiation [1–4]. The scientiﬁc interest in obtaining a deeper understanding of radiation damage is motivated
by the development of radiotherapy with ion beams [2, 5–7] and other applications of ions interacting with biological
targets, e.g. radiation protection in space [8, 9]. Protons and carbon ions are currently used for cancer treatment,
whereas the clinical implementation of other ions like helium and oxygen has been discussed as the next step [10, 11].
Heavier ions can be found in galactic cosmic rays, where such elements as iron are present, being potentially damaging
for humans during space missions [8].

The mechanisms involved in radiation damage at the nanoscale and molecular level are still not entirely understood
and are thus a subject of fundamental multidisciplinary research [1–4, 12]. The interaction of ion beams with biological
materials has commonly been studied computationally by means of track-structure Monte Carlo simulations, which
enable to follow the trajectory of each projectile, taking into account diﬀerent physical interactions, such as elastic
[13]. Some Monte Carlo tools have
and inelastic scattering, electron transfer, nuclear fragmentation reactions, etc.
recently included DNA models in the simulations of biodamage and the subsequent biological response (see [14, 15]
and references therein). Despite the wide use of the Monte Carlo approach for modeling ion propagation through
biological media, it is unable to simulate the dynamics of the molecular medium in the vicinity of ion tracks, thus
missing important physical phenomena.

It has been shown in recent years that a detailed physical understanding of the fundamental processes underlying
radiation damage is indeed possible due to recent advances in the theoretical methods and experimental tools developed
in atomic and molecular physics [2]. The phenomenon-based MultiScale Approach to the physics of radiation damage
with ions (MSA) has been formulated and elaborated during the past decade (see [2–4, 16] and references therein). This
approach considers relevant physical, chemical and biological eﬀects taking place on diﬀerent scales in space, time and
energy, and explores their manifestation in the biological damage. The key phenomena and processes treated by the
MSA are ion stopping in the medium, production of secondary electrons and free radicals as a result of ionization and
excitation of the medium, transport of secondary electrons and reactive molecular species, the interaction of secondary
particles with biomolecules, radiation chemistry, thermomechanical eﬀects caused by nanoscale shock waves induced
by ions, and the analysis of induced biodamage. The important outcome of the MSA concerns the prediction of cell
response to irradiation with ions on the basis of the assessment of complex DNA damage produced by a cascade
of the aforementioned processes. The MSA also demonstrated great success in predicting cell survival probabilities
as a function of the radiation dose in a wide range of the systems’ parameters, including diﬀerent cell types, ions
with diﬀerent values of linear energy transfer (LET), oxygenation level, as well as diﬀerent cell repair conditions
[3, 4, 17, 18].

The important physical eﬀect emphasized by the MSA concerns the manifestation of thermomechanical damage
and related phenomena (e.g.
transport of reactive secondary species) caused by nanoscale shock waves that are
created by high-LET ions traversing biological medium [19]. The formation of ion-induced shock waves was predicted
theoretically [19] and studied computationally in a series of subsequent papers [20–29]. This phenomenon arises
due to the fact that ions can deposit a large amount of energy on the nanometer scale resulting in the signiﬁcant
heating up the medium in the localized vicinity of ion tracks. The deposition of the energy lost by the ion into the
medium occurs as a result of (i) production, transport and stopping of secondary electrons, and (ii) relaxation of
the electronic excitation energy of the medium into its vibrational degrees of freedom through the electron–phonon
coupling mechanism [30].

The average kinetic energy of secondary electrons emitted in the vicinity of the Bragg peak is slightly below 40 eV
2 nanometers away
[3]. Electrons of such energy, experiencing both elastic and inelastic collisions, propagate up to 1
from the ion’s path within
50 fs before they become solvated electrons [31]. The radial distribution of secondary
electrons emitted in the vicinity of the Bragg peak, obtained from the solution of the diﬀusion equation, is in agreement
with the outcomes of track-structure Monte Carlo simulations [32, 33].

The energy lost by electrons in the processes of ionization and excitation of the medium is transferred to its
heating (i.e. vibrational excitation of molecules) due to the electron–phonon interaction, enabling the electronic de-
excitation of the molecules from the energy levels forbidden for other channels of de-excitation (such as autoionization,
1–2 nm radius surrounding
fragmentation or Auger processes). As a result, the medium within the cylinder of the
the ion’s path is heated up rapidly and the pressure inside this cylinder increases by several orders of magnitude
(e.g. by a factor of 103 for a carbon ion at the Bragg peak [34]) compared to the pressure in the medium outside
the cylinder. High local temperature and pressure around the ion’s path initiate a strong cylindrical explosion of
the excited medium, resulting in the formation of a shock wave [19]. Note that this eﬀect has been yet unnoticed
in the track-structure models based on the Monte Carlo approach although the classical theory of shock waves was
established long ago [35, 36]. Note also that the ion-induced shock wave eﬀect has been completely disregarded in the
adaptation of the MSA formalism by other groups [37].

∼

The two possible mechanisms of DNA damage originating from the ion-induced shock wave have been suggested
[3, 22]. The shock wave may inﬂict damage by the thermomechanical stress and induce breakage of covalent bonds in
the DNA molecule [20, 22–24, 26, 29]. Besides, the radial collective motion of the medium induced by the shock wave
is instrumental in propagating the highly reactive molecular species, such as hydroxyl radicals and solvated electrons,
to large radial distances (up to tens of nanometers) and preventing their recombination [25, 31].

There are several strong evidences of the ion-induced shock wave eﬀect. First of all, as the shock wave spreads
out, it becomes weaker and eventually turns into an acoustic wave at large distances from the ion’s path. Acoustic
waves coming from the Bragg peak region of ions’ trajectories were detected experimentally [38–40]. Second, a similar
phenomenon arising on the micrometer scale was observed during irradiation of micron-sized water droplets with
intense X-ray femtosecond pulses [41, 42]. Third, theoretical predictions for the radius and pressure on the shock
wave front, based on the analytical solution of hydrodynamic equations [19], were supported by a series of molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations [20, 22, 24, 25, 29]. Finally, the inclusion of the shock wave eﬀect in the multiscale
scenario of biodamage with ions [3, 4] has enabled to reproduce experimentally measured cell survival probabilities
and related radiobiological quantities such as oxygen enhancement ratio [17, 18].

In the earlier investigations [20, 22, 24], the DNA damage by ion-induced shock waves was studied by means of
classical MD simulations using non-reactive molecular mechanics force ﬁelds. In those simulations the potential energy
stored in a particular DNA bond was monitored in time as the bond length varied around its equilibrium distance
[22, 24]. When the potential energy of the bond exceeded a given threshold value, the bond was considered broken. A

3

more quantitative description of the phenomenon became possible by means of reactive MD simulations that permitted
explicit simulation of covalent bond rupture and formation [43]. A recent study [29] presented a detailed computational
protocol for modeling the shock wave induced DNA damage by means of the reactive CHARMM (rCHARMM) force
ﬁeld [43].

In this paper the thermomechanical stress of the DNA molecule caused by the ion-induced shock wave is systemati-
cally explored by means of MD simulations with the rCHARMM force ﬁeld following the aforementioned computational
protocol [29]. Several projectile ions ranging from carbon to iron with diﬀerent LET values corresponding to the Bragg
peak region in liquid water are considered. The number of DNA strand breaks occurring in either one or both DNA
strands is evaluated for each projectile ion as a function of the bond dissociation energy and the distance from the
ion’s path to the DNA strands. The simulations reveal that the shock wave induced thermomechanical stress by
carbon and oxygen ions causes only a few isolated strand breaks within a DNA double twist containing 20 base pairs.
At higher LET values the thermomechanical stress induced by the shock wave becomes the dominant mechanism of
DNA damage. This investigation reveals that argon and especially iron ions produce highly complex DNA damage
consisting of multiple localized DNA strand breaks.

The quantitative information obtained from the performed MD simulations has been utilized to evaluate (by means
of the MSA formalism) the survival probabilities of cells irradiated with ions. It has been established that the shock
wave aﬀects the survival probabilities of cells irradiated with carbon ions mainly via the transport of reactive species
away from the ion track. The shock wave induced by a single high-LET iron ion hitting a cell nucleus produces,
in addition to the transport of reactive species, lethal damage to the cell due to the thermomechanical stress. The
accounting for this DNA damage mechanism within the MSA permits explaining the “overkill” eﬀect, which arises
when high-LET ions produce more biodamage than needed for the cell inactivation. A good agreement of the
calculated cell survival probabilities with experimental data obtained for the cell irradiation with iron ions provides
strong experimental evidence for the ion-induced shock wave eﬀect.

II. METHODOLOGY

After setting up the all-atom model of a DNA molecule a series of reactive MD simulations have been performed
while varying several parameters that characterize the interaction of an ion-induced shock wave with the target. The
ﬁrst part of this section describes the essentials of the computational protocol and introduces the diﬀerent parameters
used in the simulations. More details about this protocol are given in the recent study [29]. The second part of this
section outlines the essentials of the MSA formalism regarding the evaluation of the number of DNA lesions produced
by a projectile ion and the corresponding cell survival probability. The existing MSA formalism [3, 4] is then extended
to account for the shock-wave induced thermomechanical stress in the DNA damage caused by ion irradiation. It
should be noted that VMD [44] and MBN Studio [45] software have been used in the data analysis and visualization
throughout the paper.

A. Setting MD simulations of the DNA system

In order to conduct simulations of DNA damage induced by the shock wave the system must ﬁrst be constructed
and undergo an extensive, multi-step equilibration process to correctly introduce the reactive rCHARMM force ﬁeld
[43] and ensure the system’s stability before the simulation of the shock wave propagation. The methodology of
designing and equilibrating the system was described in detail in our earlier study [29], and is therefore only brieﬂy
recapped below.

The investigated molecular system is created by joining together three short DNA segments (PDB-ID 309D [46])
resulting in a double-stranded DNA molecule containing 30 complementary base pairs. The molecule is placed in a
water box padding of 17 nm from the DNA in the x- and y-directions. The coordinate system used in the simulations
is illustrated in Fig. 1A. The x-axis of the coordinate system is oriented along the principal axis of inertia of the
chosen DNA molecule with the largest moment of inertia at the initial time instance. The ion track is oriented along
the z-axis. The y-axis is along the line deﬁning the shortest distance between the ion track and the selected principal
axis of inertia. One sodium ion is placed for every phosphate group present in the DNA to ensure a neutral charge
of the entire system, resulting in a system with a total of 1,010,994 atoms. The whole system, including the DNA
molecule and the water box, was equilibrated at 300 K temperature before the shock wave simulation. After an initial
equilibration in NAMD [47] with the standard CHARMM force ﬁeld [48, 49], the system was transferred to the MBN
Explorer software [50], where the reactive rCHARMM force ﬁeld [43] was used for further simulations.

rCHARMM is used to describe interatomic interactions in the C′

5–O and P–O bonds in the DNA
backbone, which connect the sugar ring of one nucleotide and the phosphate group of an adjacent nucleotide, see

in close proximity to the DNA molecule consisting of 30 complementary base pairs. The ion track is oriented along the z-axis;
the x-axis is oriented along one of the principal axis of inertia of the chosen DNA molecule, and the y-axis is along the line
deﬁning the shortest distance between the ion track and the selected principal axis of inertia. The collision parameter dgeo is
deﬁned as the displacement of the ion’s path along the y-axis with respect to the principal axis of inertia. The speciﬁc collision
parameters dA and dB are deﬁned as the shortest distances from the ion’s path to DNA strand A and strand B, respectively.

energy well of the covalent bond is considered in the simulations as a variable parameter. The values of De determined from
the DFT calculations have been scaled by a factor of 2/3, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/6 (see main text for details).

Fig. 1B. Contrary to the standard CHARMM force ﬁeld [49] which employs a harmonic approximation for the de-
scription of covalent interactions (thereby limiting its applicability to small deformations of the molecular system),
rCHARMM treats the bonded, angular and dihedral interactions diﬀerently [43], thus permitting an accurate de-
scription of the molecular dissociation process in complex molecular systems. The radial dependence of the bonded
interactions is described in rCHARMM by means of the Morse potential. The bonded interactions are set to zero for
interatomic distances greater than a user-deﬁned cutoﬀ distance, beyond which the bond is considered broken and
the molecular topology of the system is changed. Once a bond starts to break, the associated angular and dihedral
interactions involving the indicated atoms weaken and eventually disappear when the distance between the atoms
reaches a critical value [43]. Once all the associated bonded, angular and dihedral interactions go to zero, they are
automatically removed from the molecular topology of the system. The atoms that initially formed the broken bond
are then considered unbound, leading to the formation of atoms with dangling bonds. Bond dissociation energies for
the indicated bonds in the DNA strands and the cutoﬀ distances for bond breakage/formation have been obtained
by quantum chemistry calculations [29]. Note that the C′
3–C′
4 bond was not parameterized by the rCHARMM force
ﬁeld because the dissociation energy of the C′
4 bond is much higher (9.6 eV according to our DFT calculations)
than the dissociation energies of the aforementioned bonds (6.3

6.9 eV) [29].

The DNA damage produced by the shock wave is systematically investigated for ﬁve diﬀerent projectile ions
propagating along the z-direction by varying the distance from the ion’s path to the DNA strands and dissociation
energies of the bonds in the DNA backbone. As described in detail in the following subsections, nine diﬀerent values of

−

5

the collision parameter dgeo and ﬁve scaling factors for the bond dissociation energy De have been considered for each
projectile ion. For each simulation setup (i.e. for each ion type, values of dgeo and De), two independent simulations
of approximately 10 ps duration have been carried out. Hence, 450 independent simulations have been performed in
total, and the total simulation time exceeded 2.5 million CPU hours.

B. Setting up initial conditions for the shock wave simulation

The shock wave is induced by an energetic ion propagating through the aqueous environment, where the ion loses
its energy mainly by electronic excitation and ionization of water molecules. For ions at the Bragg peak energies,
ionization events result in the production of low-energy electrons (with the average kinetic energy of about 40 eV)
which propagate radially on the nanometer scale away from the ion’s path [3]. Theoretical analysis of secondary
electron transport revealed [31] that sub-40 eV electrons lose most of their energy by ionizing and exciting molecules
of the medium within approximately 1 nanometer from the ion’s path in about 50 femtoseconds after the ion’s passage
through the medium. The electronic excitation energy of the medium is transferred into its vibrational degrees of
freedom through the electron–phonon coupling mechanism [30]. The relaxation of the energy deposited in close
proximity to the ion track leads to a rapid increase of the temperature and the pressure of the medium around the
ion track, resulting in the dynamical response of the medium and the formation of a cylindrical shock wave that
propagates radially away from the ion track [19]. In a continuous medium this phenomenon is characterized by the
so-called self-similar ﬂow and the discontinuities of pressure and density of the medium at the wave front as follows
from the analytical solution of a set of corresponding hydrodynamic and thermodynamic equations [19].

In the MD simulations, the energy lost by the propagating ion is deposited into the kinetic energy of water molecules
located inside a “hot” cylinder of 1 nm radius around the ion’s path. The radius of 1 nm is employed for all the ions
considered in this study. The equilibrium velocities of all atoms inside the “hot” cylinder are increased by a factor α
such that the kinetic energy of these atoms reads as [20–22]:

1
2

N

i
X

mi (αvi)2 =

3N kBT
2

+ Se l .

(1)

Here Se is the LET of the simulated ion, l is the length of the simulation box in the z-direction (parallel to the ion’s
path), and N is the total number of atoms within the “hot” cylinder. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (1)
is the kinetic energy of the 1-nm radius cylinder at the equilibrium temperature, T = 300 K, whereas the second term
describes the energy loss by the ion as it propagates through the medium. Note that the 1-nm radius for the energy
deposition by low-energy secondary electrons was evaluated [22] as the average distance at which secondary electrons
lose most of their energy, according to the random walk approximation. The dispersion of the deposited energy due
to more energetic secondary electrons (with the kinetic energy above 40 eV) and its impact on the dynamics of the
ion-induced shock wave were addressed in the earlier study [51]. It was demonstrated that, for ions at the Bragg
peak, accounting for more energetic secondary electrons makes only a small correction to the results obtained for the
uniform energy deposition within the cylinder of 1 nm radius around the ion’s path. Since the present study is focused
on the eﬀects produced by ions at the Bragg peak region, the utilized “hot” cylinder model captures all the relevant
phenomena correctly.

C. Parameters for the reactive MD simulations

DNA damage caused by the ion-induced shock wave is simulated for ﬁve diﬀerent ions varying the distance from
the ion’s path to the DNA molecule and dissociation energies of bonds in the DNA backbone, see Fig. 1. The choice
of the speciﬁc parameters is explained and justiﬁed below.

1. Distance from the ion’s path to DNA strands

In the simulations each ion propagated along the z-axis orthogonal to the principal axis of inertia of the DNA
molecule with the largest moment of inertia at the initial time instance, below called simply the principle axis of
inertia. The collision parameter dgeo, deﬁned as the displacement of the ion’s path with respect to the principal
axis of inertia, varied from 0 to 12 ˚A with an increment step of 3 ˚A. The ion’s path was considered at the positive
and the negative directions along the y-axis resulting in the positive and negative values of dgeo. To account for the

orientation of DNA strands with respect to the ion’s path, the collision parameter was related to the shortest distance
to strand A, dA, and the shortest distance to the strand B, dB. As such, an increase of the displacement dgeo could
result simultaneously in an increased distance to one strand and a decreased distance to the other strand. Geometry
of the system is illustrated in Fig. 1A, whereas the values of the considered parameters dgeo, dA and dB are listed in
Table I.

2. Dissociation energy of covalent bonds in the DNA backbone

The number of DNA strand breaks induced by the shock wave impact may depend on the energy required to break
covalent bonds. The typical dissociation energy of covalent bonds in the DNA backbone varies from about 3 to 6 eV
[52]. The deposition of such an amount of energy into a given bond would most likely lead to its instantaneous
rupture. However, it has also been established that the threshold energy for bond dissociation can be several times
smaller due to the presence of solvated electrons in the molecular medium surrounding the DNA. For instance, it was
shown [53, 54] that attachment of a solvated electron to a DNA molecule decreases the dissociation energy of covalent
1 eV and leads predominantly to cleavage of a phosphodiester bond. In the present
bonds in the backbone down to
study the bond dissociation energy De is considered as a variable parameter to account for diﬀerent possible scenarios
that happen on the femto- to sub-picosecond time scales preceding the shock wave formation. A detailed analysis
of the DNA damage events created by secondary electrons on the indicated time scales is beyond the scope of this
study. Dissociation energies for several bonds along the DNA backbone, shown in Fig. 1B, were determined from
density functional theory (DFT) calculations [29]. The obtained values are scaled by a factor of 2/3, 1/2, 1/3 and
1/6 to account for the weakening of the bonds, which may happen e.g. upon the attachment of solvated electrons.
The resulting bond dissociation energies thus vary from about 1 eV to 6 eV; this range corresponds to the range of
values reported in [52–54].

∼

3. Diﬀerent projectile ions

The number of shock wave induced DNA strand breaks also depends on the type of ions irradiating the biological
target. Carbon ions are presently used as radiation modality in ion-beam cancer treatments [2, 5–7], whereas the
interaction with heavier ions (up to iron) is particularly relevant for the radiation protection of astronauts during
In the present study shock waves induced by ﬁve diﬀerent projectile ions (C6+, O8+,
manned space missions [8].
Si14+, Ar18+ and Fe26+) with energies corresponding to the Bragg peak region in liquid water are analyzed.

The LET Se as a function of projectile’s kinetic energy E has been calculated using the analytical MSA model
described in detail in earlier studies [3, 55, 56]. The model is based upon the Rudd’s formalism [57] which is extended
to account for relativistic corrections and an eﬀective charge of the projectile that arises when a bare ion picks oﬀ
electrons while propagating through a medium. The dependence of LET on E then reads as:

Se(E) =

dE
dx

= n

(W + Ii)

i
X

Z0

dσi
dW

dW ,

(2)

where n is the number density of water molecules in the medium and W is the kinetic energy of ejected electrons.
The sum on the right-hand side is taken over all electron shells of the water molecule with Ii being the binding
energy of the ith electron shell and dσi/dW the partial single diﬀerential ionization cross section of the corresponding
shell. Parameters of the analytical MSA model for liquid water are taken from [58]. Although these parameters were
originally derived for proton–water interactions, they are also applicable for evaluating the LET of heavier ions, as
illustrated below.

Solid lines in Figure 2A show the Se(E) dependence for C6+, O8+, Si14+, Ar18+ and Fe26+ ions calculated using
Eq. (2). The results are compared with the values compiled in the ICRU73 report [59] (open symbols) and the results

shows a detailed comparison of the calculated LET for carbon ions with the results of recent experiments [62] (open

The Se(E) dependence calculated using Eq. (2) (thick solid line) gives the best agreement with the experimental
data for carbon ions [62] in terms of both the position of the Bragg peak and its magnitude. Reportedly, there is
no experimentally measured Se(E) dependence for ions heavier than carbon, and the comparison can only be made
with the results of other calculations or Monte Carlo simulations. As shown in Fig. 2, there is some deviation (about
10
15% in the Bragg peak region) between the results obtained with diﬀerent theoretical methods. The results of
the present analysis ﬁt nicely into this range of values. Table II lists the values of LET for each ion at the Bragg peak
in liquid water and provides the respective ion’s kinetic energy. The values from Table II have been used in Eq. (1) to
scale the velocities of atoms of the medium located within the “hot” cylinder for the MD simulations of shock wave
propagation.

D. Shock wave propagation in pure water

In order to quantify the impact of the shock wave on the transport of reactive molecular species, additional MD
simulations of a shock wave propagating in pure water have been performed following the computational protocol
8 nm. No DNA molecule or neutralizing
described in [29]. The water box dimensions were set to 49.5 nm
ions were included, so that the shock wave propagated in liquid water. Simulations for the shock wave induced by
silicon, argon and iron ions were carried out for
10 ps, while the simulations for the lighter (carbon and oxygen)
ions were performed for

III. EVALUATION OF THE NUMBER OF ION-INDUCED DNA LESIONS AND CELL SURVIVAL
PROBABILITY

The MSA formalism has been developed to describe survival probabilities of cells irradiated with ion beams on the
basis of detailed physical understanding of the fundamental processes underlying radiation damage by ions [3, 4, 17].
As described above, all the relevant physical, chemical and biological processes and phenomena are interlinked within
the MSA into a uniﬁed multiscale scenario of ion-induced biodamage. A comprehensive description of the MSA
formalism is presented in [2–4]. This section outlines the formalism for evaluating the number of lesions of the DNA
molecule produced upon its irradiation with ions and the corresponding cell survival probabilities. The case study is
focused on the projectile ions in the vicinity of the Bragg peak. The previously developed formalism [2–4] is extended
towards accounting for the DNA lesions produced by the thermomechanical stress imposed on the DNA molecule by
the propagating shock wave.

The starting point for this theory is the calculation of

(r, Se) – the total average number of simple lesions, i.e.
N

is the number of simple lesions produced by secondary electrons. The function Fe(r, Se) is the number of electrons
incident on the DNA segment located at distance r from the ion’s path. The quantity Γe is the average probability of
producing a SSB per electron hit. For ions in the Bragg peak region the probability Γe does not depend on Se since
the average kinetic energy of produced secondary electrons is about 40 eV for diﬀerent ions with diﬀerent LET values
[3]. For ions outside the Bragg peak region the dependence of Γe on Se should arise as the kinetic energy of produced
δ-electrons is LET-dependent. The analysis of this regime goes beyond the scope of the present study.

Nr,0(Se) depends on the number of formed free radicals, which in turn is proportional to the number of

A lethal DNA lesion is deﬁned within the MSA framework as one double-strand break (DSB) plus at least two
additional single lesions occurring within a DNA double twist [3]. This deﬁnition relies on earlier ﬁndings [67–69]
that complex DNA damage is irreparable for a cell if the damage occurs in a localized DNA segment, which typically
consists of two helical turns containing 20 base pairs.

Lesions within the DNA double twist may occur on one DNA strand or be present on both strands. As shown
in Fig. 1 each nucleotide in the DNA molecule has four vulnerable covalent bonds in the sugar-phosphate backbone.
Therefore the number of such covalent bonds in one strand in a DNA double twist is equal to 80, and the total number
of such bonds in both strands in the DNA double twist is 2n = 160.

The total number of events Nν for ν = 0, 1, ..., 2n lesions occurring within the DNA double twist is equal to the

number of combinations for ν choices taken out of 2n places:

Nν = Cν

2n ≡

ν = 0, 1, ..., 2n .

On the other hand, the number of independent events of k lesions occurring in a single DNA strand of the length n
is equal to Ck

Nν is equal to

to the same result for Nν as given by Eq. (7).

Here λ is the probability that a SSB can be converted to a DSB and νmax = 2n. Accounting for λ relies on the
experimental ﬁndings [71, 72] that the DSBs caused by low-energy electrons with energies higher than
5 eV happen
in one hit. In that case the subsequent break in the second DNA strand occurs due to the action of debris generated
by the ﬁrst SSB. Following [71, 72] λ is set equal to 0.15 within the MSA framework [3].

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (18) describes the sum of probabilities to have all ν (ν = 3, 4, ..., 2n)
lesions on one DNA strand with the subsequent conversion of one SSB into a DSB. The second term is the probability
of three lesions with at least one DSB among them and the subsequent conversion of one SSB into a DSB, i.e. creating
two DSBs. The third term is the sum of probabilities of ν lesions (ν = 4, 5, ..., 2n) with creation of at least one DSB.

The function σl(Se) is the cross section of producing lethal DNA damage in a cell nucleus, which depends on LET

Now let us analyze the dependence of the cross section of a DNA lethal lesion σl and the number of lethal lesions in

case for this scenario is irradiation with protons. In this case the number of lesions in a DNA double twist

DNA double twist is proportional to LET,
of lesions created by secondary electrons incident on a DNA double twist,
Ne(r, Se), is proportional to the number
of such electrons (see Eq. (4)), which in turn is proportional to LET. The number of lesions created by free radicals,
Nr(r, Se), is determined by the number of such species, which is proportional to the number of secondary electrons
[31]. The shock wave induced by protons at the Bragg peak does not transport free radicals and other reactive species
to the distances much larger than the secondary electron propagation range Re. Note, however, that the diﬀusion
of free radicals on the picosecond time scale might be aﬀected by the temperature increase in the vicinity of the ion
tracks. As follows from the analysis described below in Sect. IV B, the free radicals propagation range Rr is smaller

Nr(r, Se) with Se will result in the faster growth of σl and Yl with increasing Se. Even steeper
dependencies of σl and Yl on LET may arise at higher Se values when the number of lesions in a DNA double twist

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The ﬁrst part of this section presents the results of the reactive MD simulations of the shock wave induced damage
occurring in a 30 base pairs long DNA segment introduced in Fig. 1. The simulations revealed that most bond breaks
in the DNA backbone are produced within the central segment consisting of two helical turns and containing 20
base pairs. Therefore, the number of bond breaks in the central DNA double twist, being the target DNA segment
considered within the MSA formalism [3], has been quantiﬁed. The shock wave induced dynamics of the liquid water
medium is analyzed next to evaluate the range of shock wave propagation and hence the range of shock wave driven
propagation of reactive species. The analysis concludes with the evaluation of survival probabilities of cells irradiated
with high-LET ions within the MSA formalism. This analysis reveals the signiﬁcant role of the shock wave induced
thermomechanical mechanism of DNA damage in the cell inactivation.

A. Quantiﬁcation of the number of bond breaks in the DNA double twist

MD simulations of the shock wave induced damage of a 30 base pairs long DNA molecule reveal that the projectile
ion propagating in close proximity to the principal axis of inertia of the molecule produces signiﬁcant damage within
the central segment containing 20 DNA base pairs. The DNA damage produced in segments of such size may lead to
complex irreparable lesions in a cell [3, 17, 67]. The number of bond breaks in the DNA double twist was counted after
each completed MD simulation and analyzed as a function of the distance dgeo from the ion’s path to the principal
axis of inertia of the DNA molecule, see Fig. 1A. The results of the performed analysis are shown in Fig. 4.

The ﬁgure shows that the number of bond breaks produced in the DNA double twist by the ion-induced shock wave
increases with the LET of a projectile ion (see Table II). Simulation results obtained for the scaled bond dissociation
energies De/6 (Fig. 4A) reveal that up to two DNA backbone bonds break due to the shock wave induced by the
carbon ion whereas up to 50 bonds may be broken due to the iron ion impact. For every combination of the bond

a certain distance range from the ion’s path; the values
As the ion passes at larger distances from the main axis of the DNA molecule the average number of bond breaks
within the DNA double twist gradually decreases. Figure 4 shows that the shock wave induced thermomechanical
stress of the DNA mostly occurs at <
1 nm from the ion’s path for ions lighter than iron. A more systematic and
∼
precise analysis of the threshold distance from the ion’s path for inducing DNA strand breaks for each projectile ion
is possible, but it would require a signiﬁcantly larger number of additional simulations aiming at decreasing statistical
uncertainties and considering larger values of the collision parameter dgeo. Such an analysis might be considered in
the future.

The spatial distribution of the total number of bond breaks occurring in the DNA double twist has been analyzed
as a function of the shortest distances dA and dB (see Fig. 1) from the ion’s path to DNA strand A and strand
B, respectively. Figure 5 shows the results obtained with the scaled bond dissociation energies De/6. Due to the
geometry of the studied system, not all combinations of dA and dB are accessible at the same time; the inaccessible
spatial regions in Fig. 5 are marked with dashed lines. The total number of strand breaks in the DNA double twist
decreases with the simultaneous increase of the distance from the ion track to both DNA strands. The results shown
in Fig. 5 indicate that the number of bond breaks drops sharply when the ion track passes at distances larger than
5 ˚A to both DNA strands. In contrast, the largest number of bond breaks in the sugar-phosphate backbone is observed
when the ion passes in close proximity to at least one of the DNA strands.

B. Propagation range for ion-induced shock waves

The front of the shock wave propagates radially away from the ion’s path. The dependence of the radius of the

wave front R on time reads as [19]:

R = β√t

,

(40)

(cid:18)
where t is the time from the start of the shock wave propagation, Se is the ion’s LET, ρ is the density of the
unperturbed medium (ρ = 1 g/cm3 for liquid water) and β = 0.86 is a dimensionless parameter determined in [19].
The position of the wave front calculated for diﬀerent projectile ions is illustrated in Fig. 6.

(cid:19)

To evaluate the range of shock wave driven propagation of reactive species, a shock wave propagation was simulated
in a pure water box with dimensions of 49.5 nm
8.0 nm. The evolution of radial density of water around
the tracks of the ﬁve projectile ions is shown in Fig. 7. Water molecules located in the vicinity of the ion’s path are
transported away from their initial positions, which results in the formation of a cylindrical cavity around the ion’s
path. The radius of the cavity grows with time up to the values of about 6 nm for carbon and oxygen ions, while
the density of water increases at larger distances from the ion’s path. Following the mass conservation law, the mass
of water molecules transported from the region in the vicinity of the ion track should be equal to the mass of excess
water molecules at larger distances from the track.

caused by propagation of the shock wave induced by iron, argon, silicon, oxygen and carbon ions inside a 49.5 nm × 49.5 nm ×
8.0 nm water box. The simulation time (measured in ps) is depicted as a color scale. The shock wave induced by iron, argon
and silicon ions (top row) has reached the simulation box boundary much faster than the shock wave induced by oxygen and
carbon ions (bottom row). Therefore, the simulation time for iron, argon and silicon ions is about 3 times shorter than for the
lighter ions.

FIG. 8. A: Variation of the density of water caused the carbon ion induced shock wave as a function of radial distance from
the ion track. The simulation time is indicated in the sidebar. The position of the shock wave front R calculated using Eq. (40)
is indicated with dots. The position of the wave front separates the mass transported by the shock wave, that is considered as
displaced (behind the wave front, i.e. at r < R) and excess (beyond the wave front, i.e. at r > R). B: Time evolution of the
linear mass density, deﬁned as the water mass transported by the carbon ion-induced shock wave and normalized by the unit
length of ion’s trajectory. The displaced mass calculated behind the wave front is shown by the dashed black line whereas the
excess mass beyond the wave front is shown by the solid green line.

The position of the shock wave front at diﬀerent time instances, determined using Eq. (40), is depicted in Fig. 8A
with symbols for the case of a carbon ion induced shock wave. The mass of all water molecules behind the wave front
is calculated and normalized to the unit length of ion’s trajectory. The obtained value is compared to the normalized
excess mass beyond the wave front. The comparison shown in Fig. 8B illustrates that the linear mass density is indeed
conserved within the simulation time range considered.

The simulation of the propagation of the carbon ion induced shock wave reveals that at a certain time instance the
shock wave has stopped propagating away from the ion’s path and started to move slowly in the inward direction.
This happens when the pressure of the shock wave front drops below a certain value determined by the balance of
the pressure at the wave front and the water surface tension pressure [27, 65]. Fig. 9A shows the radial position of
the maximal density of water as a function of simulation time for the case of the projectile carbon ion. The radial
displacement of the maximal density from the ion track axis increases rapidly during the ﬁrst 15 ps of the simulation,
then reaches the maximal value and starts to decrease at later time instances. The analysis shown in Figure 9A
suggests that the maximal radial displacement of the density corresponds to the time instance t = 16.7 ps. Note
that for t > 20 ps the radial displacement of the maximal density stops decreasing but ﬂuctuates around the value
of 21 nm. This behavior is attributed to interference with the outer part of the shock wave front, which reaches the
simulation box boundary and gets reﬂected. The behavior of the system within the simulation time range t
20 ps
is nevertheless physically meaningful as the shock wave has not yet reached the simulation box boundary within this
time interval.

≤

According to Eq. (40), the front of the carbon ion induced shock wave propagates by the time t = 16.7 ps to the
distance R = 11.9 nm from the ion track. This characteristic distance deﬁnes the propagation range of free radicals,
Rr in Eq. (5), which are transported by the shock wave driven collective ﬂow. To evaluate the range of shock wave
propagation for heavier ions one would need to run longer simulations and consider much larger simulation boxes than
the one used in the present study. Alternatively, the range of the shock wave propagation induced by high-LET ions
can be estimated from the analysis of the pressure on the shock wave front [19]:

where β = 0.86 is a dimensionless parameter determined in [19], γ = CP /CV is the heat capacity ratio (γ = 1.222

wave front generated by the diﬀerent ions in the Bragg peak region. Colored lines correspond to the results derived
using Eq. (41). A red dot depicts the pressure P = 0.115 GPa at the distance R = 11.9 nm from the ion track, that
is the maximal distance of the wave front propagation for a carbon ion. The indicated value of R corresponding to
the instant t = 16.7 ps has been evaluated using Eq. (40).

The shock wave propagation in the radial direction away from the ion’s path causes cavitation in its wake, leading
to the formation of a rareﬁed cylindrical region [19, 65]. This eﬀect has been observed in MD simulations described
in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8A. In the course of the shock wave propagation, the pressure at the shock wave front becomes
balanced by the surface tension pressure building up at the border of the wake region. As a result, the growth of the
wake region stops and this region shrinks after the instant when the pressure of the wave front becomes equal to the
water surface tension pressure on the surface of the wake region. The latter can be estimated as

P =

ξ
R

,

(42)

where ξ is the coeﬃcient of surface tension and R is the distance from the ion track. Using the aforementioned values
P = 0.115 GPa and R = 11.9 nm for the carbon ion at the Bragg peak, one obtains the surface tension coeﬃcient
ξ = 1.37 N/m. Note that the medium in the vicinity of the shock wave front is far from equilibrium, and the density
of the medium is signiﬁcantly higher than the density of water at ambient conditions. The high water density in the
vicinity of the shock wave front and the large amount of energy deposited into the medium explain the large value
of the corresponding surface tension coeﬃcient. The dependence of the surface tension pressure on the distance from
the ion track, calculated using Eq. (42), is shown in Fig. 9B by a dashed line.

Assuming that ξ depends weakly and smoothly on LET (or does not depend at all) at the pressures balance point
one can evaluate the radii Rr for diﬀerent ions. The radii Rr deﬁne the propagation ranges of free radicals transported
by the shock wave induced by diﬀerent ions. Equating the pressure on the shock wave front, Eq. (41), and the surface

tension pressure, Eq. (42), one obtains a linear dependence of Rr on LET:

during the time corresponding to the duration of formation of the shock wave wake region with the maximum radius.

C. Force exerted by the shock wave on the DNA

The characteristic range of the shock wave induced thermomechanical damage, RSW, can be evaluated by analyzing
the pressure on the shock wave front, Eq. (41), and the corresponding force exerted by the shock wave on covalent
bonds in the DNA backbone.

Equation (41) arises as a solution of the hydrodynamic Euler equation, the continuity and entropy conservation
equations [19]. As such, it is applicable to the volumes with sizes being much larger than the characteristic size of
a single molecule or a molecular bond. Nevertheless, the medium pressure induces forces applied to single molecular
bonds. Such forces should be treated as a result of averaging over an ensemble of molecules exposed to the pressure
P (r) at a distance r from the ion track.

Let us evaluate forces acting on molecular bonds in the presence of the ion-induced shock wave. For the sake of
simplicity, let us consider a molecular bond oriented parallel to the direction of the shock wave propagation. The
force stretching the bond is given by:

F = (πa2
0)

∂P
∂r

l ,

(44)

0 is the transverse area of the molecular bond exposed to the pressure created by the shock wave front, ∂P
where πa2
∂r
is the pressure gradient, and l is a characteristic interatomic distance in the medium on which the pressure gradient
is evaluated. The calculations described below are performed using the value a0 = 0.15 nm corresponding to the van
der Waals radius for atoms forming the DNA backbone [73] and l
0.15 nm, that is a characteristic length of covalent
bonds in the DNA backbone.

5–O and P–O bonds in the DNA backbone (see Fig. 1B) are
determined from the potential energy curves obtained by means of DFT [29] and listed in Table V. The second term
on the right-hand side of Eq. (45) describes the work against the force ~F , caused by the pressure gradient on the
distance from r0 to r. The force ~F should not depend on the interatomic distance r as it originates from the medium
and is deﬁned by its properties at given thermodynamic conditions and at any given location of the bond in space.

the bond rupture becomes possible. The threshold values of F are evaluated using Eq. (44) with the pressure gradient
∂r being related to the derivative of the pressure at the shock wave front, ∂P
∂P

∂R , via Eq. (63).

The results presented in Fig. 11 and Table VI indicate that the threshold distance from the ion’s path for the bond
rupture by the pressure gradient on the shock wave front varies from 0.7 nm for a carbon ion at the Bragg peak to
1.3 nm for an iron ion at the Bragg peak. The estimated RSW values are consistent with the results of MD simulations
shown in Fig. 4. Note however that no strand breaks have been observed in the simulations for carbon and oxygen
projectile ions for the default bond dissociation energies De (Fig. 4C), which can be attributed to a small number of
simulated trajectories and low number of the events. Accounting for diﬀerent possible orientations of the molecular
bonds in the DNA backbone should also increase their average stability. Simulations performed with the scaled bond
dissociation energies De/2 and De/6 (Fig. 4B and Fig. 4A, respectively) indicate the formation of bond breaks in the
DNA backbone by the carbon- and oxygen-ion induced shock wave within the range of distances from the ion track,
which are consistent with the RSW values determined by Eq. (65) and listed in Table VI.

D. Shock wave induced DNA lethal damage of cells irradiated with high-LET ions

Figure 12 shows the average number of simple lesions per a DNA double twist as a function of radial distance from
the ion’s path for irradiation with a carbon ion (Fig. 12A) and with an iron ion (Fig. 12B) in the vicinity of the
corresponding Bragg peaks. The average number of simple lesions created by secondary electrons and free radicals
Nr(r, Se)), is calculated according to Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively. The average number of lesions
Ne(r, Se) and
(
created by the shock wave induced thermomechanical stress of the DNA,
NSW, is taken from the MD simulations
described in Sect. IV A (see Table III). The number of breaks corresponds to the bond dissociation energies De
obtained from the DFT calculations [29].

As follows from the MD simulations (see Fig. 4 and Table III) the thermomechanical stress by the carbon ion
induced shock wave does not produce any lesions within the DNA double twist for the bond dissociation energies De.
In the case of irradiation with a carbon ion, the lesions are created by secondary electrons, free radicals and other
reactive species which are spread over the large distance range by the shock wave, see Fig. 12A. This is in agreement
with the results of earlier studies [3, 22] which demonstrated that at the values of LET typical for a single carbon ion
at the Bragg peak (Se = 830 keV/µm), most of ion-induced DNA damage occurs via the chemical eﬀects involving
interactions of DNA molecules with secondary electrons, free radicals, solvated electrons, etc. In contrast, the number
of lesions produced by the thermomechanical stress caused by the iron ion induced shock wave outweighs the number
of lesions produced by the chemical eﬀects at distances r
RSW from the ion’s path, as shown in Fig. 12B. The
analysis described below has been performed using the eﬀective radius RSW = 0.4 nm for the iron ion at the Bragg
peak, which is lower than the values reported in Sect. IV C. One should stress that the model presented in Sect. IV C
gives the maximal values of RSW for the ﬁve studied ions at the Bragg peak, corresponding to the ideal orientation
of the molecular bond parallel to the direction of the shock wave propagation. Accounting for diﬀerent orientations
of the bonds in the DNA backbone with respect to the direction of a shock wave propagation should lead to lowering
the RSW values. The value RSW = 0.4 nm has been obtained by averaging the number of lesions produced due to
direct thermomechanical damage by the iron ion-induced shock wave,
NSW, over the range of distances from the ion
track to the principal axis of the DNA molecule, see Fig. 4C.
On the basis of the non-reactive MD simulations and subsequent estimates for the energy deposited into the DNA
backbone bonds, it was concluded earlier [22] that the bond breaking due to the shock wave induced thermomechanical
stress becomes dominant for ions heavier than argon, propagating in liquid water. This result is conﬁrmed in the
present study by means of reactive MD simulations.

Bragg peak energies, as a function of radial distance from the ion’s path. Ne(r) and Nr(r) are the numbers of simple lesions
produced by secondary electrons and free radicals, respectively. NSW(r) is the average number of lesions produced due to direct
thermomechanical damage by the ion-induced shock wave. The value NSW = 5.4 at r ≤ RSW = 0.4 nm was obtained from MD
simulations, as summarized in Fig. 4 and Table III. See the text for further details.

and free radicals, as well as these agents together with the shock wave (SW) induced thermomechanical stress of the DNA.

distance r from the ion’s path, Eqs. (19) and (21), are shown in Fig. 13 for carbon and iron ions. In the case of
irradiation with iron ions (see Fig. 13B), accounting for the shock wave induced thermomechanical stress results in
RSW from the
a signiﬁcant increase of the probability of lethal DNA damage within the characteristic distance r
ion track. A conservative estimate for the number of bond breaks produced by the iron ion induced shock wave
thermomechanical stress, corresponding to the largest bond dissociation energy De (see Fig. 4 and Table III), reveals
that ﬁve or more bond breaks within the DNA double twist are created when the iron ion propagates at distances
smaller than RSW = 0.4 nm from the principal axis of inertia of the DNA molecule. The indicated number of
breaks exceeds the minimal number of lesions needed to produce the lethal DNA damage, and hence the probability
0.4 nm from the iron ion track. This means that even a single hit of a cell nucleus by a high-LET

ion will be suﬃcient to inactivate the cell.

values of LET; the probabilities were evaluated within the MSA using Eqs. (19)–(32). Lines show the survival
curves obtained with accounting for the DNA damage produced by the secondary electrons, free radicals and the
shock wave mechanism. For carbon ion irradiation, the shock wave mechanism enhances transport of radicals and
thus reduces their fast recombination thereby increasing the damaging eﬀect of projectile ions. However, the direct
thermomechanical DNA damage by the shock wave plays a minor role in the case of carbon ion irradiation. One should
stress a good agreement of the calculated survival probabilities with experimental data [74, 75]. These calculations
were performed using the range of shock wave driven propagation of reactive species, Rr = 11.9 nm, which was
determined from the reactive MD simulations described in Sect. IV B (see Table IV).

The shock wave mechanism plays even bigger role in producing lethal damage to cells by high-LET ions as demon-
strates in Fig. 13B. Figure 15 shows survival probabilities for two normal rodent cells, V79 and CHO, irradiated with
high-LET iron ions in the vicinity of the Bragg peak. Solid red lines show the probabilities calculated with accounting

26

for the shock-wave induced thermomechanical damage. These probabilities were calculated within the MSA using the
number of lethal lesions Yl, deﬁned by Eq. (37), and RSW = 0.4 nm, as discussed above. Dashed black lines show
the probabilities calculated with accounting for DNA damage produced only by secondary electrons and free radicals.
It is apparent that for the irradiation with high-LET ions the shock wave induced thermomechanical stress of the
DNA has a signiﬁcant impact on the cell survival probabilities. If this mechanism is not taken into consideration,
the calculated survival probabilities deviate by orders of magnitude from the experimental values [76, 77]. Indeed,
according to Eqs. (27)–(32), the number of lethal lesions Yl produced by secondary electrons and free radicals in a
cell nucleus grows with an increase of LET. As a consequence, the slope of cell survival curves would monotonically
increase with an increase of LET. This behavior contradicts with experimentally observed phenomenon known as the
“overkill” eﬀect, which manifests itself when cells are irradiated with high-LET ions. At higher LET a given dose
can be delivered with the smaller number of ions. This increases chances that some cells remain non-targeted, i.e.
the cell survival probability should increase. This leads to a less steep dependence of cell survival probability on the
deposited dose [7].

Diﬀerent approaches have been adopted in existing radiobiological models to account for the “overkill” eﬀect. For
instance, empirical saturation corrections due to non-Poisson distribution of lethal lesions in the cell nucleus were
introduced in the commonly used LEM and MKM models to describe the radiobiological response to high-LET
irradiation [78, 79].
In contrast to other models, the MSA describes quantitatively the “overkill” eﬀect through
accounting for the shock wave induced thermomechanical stress of the DNA.

As follows from Eq. (37), the quantiﬁcation of the number of lethal lesions produced by the ion-induced shock wave
in a cell requires data on nucleus area for a particular cell line. Solid red curves in Figs. 15(A,B) are obtained with
the values An(V79) = 88 µm2 and An(CHO) = 127 µm2 taken, respectively, from the experimental studies [80, 81].
As it was reported by Konishi et al.
[81], the distribution of nucleus areas for the CHO cells is characterized by a
rather broad Gaussian-like proﬁle, and the measured nucleus areas varies from about 80 µm2 up to 160 µm2 with the
average value of 127 µm2. The variation of the calculated cell survival probabilities related to the variation of the
nucleus size is illustrated in Fig. 15 by the shaded areas. Note also that no data on the experimental uncertainties
of the measured cell survival probabilities were provided in the earlier experimental studies [80, 81]. Therefore, the
characteristic uncertainties for the cells irradiated at doses up to about 10 Gy have been estimated based on the typical
experimental uncertainties arising in such measurements with carbon ions (Fig. 14). The estimated uncertainties for
the iron ion irradiation are shown in Fig. 15 by gray color. One may thus conclude that, within the experimental
uncertainties, the calculated survival probabilities for cells irradiated with iron ions are in a very good agreement with
the experimental results [76, 77]. This agreement provides a strong experimental evidence for the biodamage eﬀects
caused by ion induced shock waves upon irradiation of biological targets with high-LET ions.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The thermomechanical stress of the DNA molecule caused by the ion-induced shock wave was explored using the
reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed by means of high-performance computing. Five projectile
ions with diﬀerent values of LET, ranging from carbon to iron at the Bragg peak energies in liquid water, were
considered. The number of bond breaks in the DNA backbone was systematically evaluated for each projectile ion
as a function of bond dissociation energy and the distance from the ion’s path to the principal axis of inertia of the
DNA molecule.

Reactive MD simulations revealed that argon and, especially, iron ions induce rupture of multiple bonds in a DNA
double twist containing 20 DNA base pairs. The DNA damage produced in segments of such size lead to complex
irreparable lesions in a cell [3, 17, 67]. This makes the thermomechanical stress of the DNA molecule caused by
the ion-induced shock wave the dominant mechanism of complex DNA damage at the high-LET ion irradiation. In
contrast, the shock wave induced by lighter ions, such as carbon and oxygen, causes only a few isolated bond breaks
within a DNA double twist, but plays an important role in the transport of reactive species to larger distances away
from the ion track.

A detailed theory for evaluating the DNA damage caused by ions at high-LET was formulated and integrated into
the multiscale approach to the physics of radiation damage with ions (MSA). The theoretical analysis revealed that
a single high-LET ion hitting a cell nucleus is suﬃcient to produce highly complex, lethal damages to a cell by the
shock wave induced thermomechanical stress. Using the parameters of the ion-induced shock wave propagation in
liquid water, obtained numerically from MD simulations, survival probabilities of cells irradiated with high-LET iron
ions were evaluated by means of the MSA. Accounting for the shock wave induced thermomechanical mechanism
of DNA damage within the MSA provides an explanation for the “overkill” eﬀect observed experimentally in the
dependence of cell survival probabilities on the radiation dose delivered with iron ions. A good agreement of the
calculated cell survival probabilities with experimental data obtained for the cell irradiation with iron ions provides

strong experimental evidence of the ion-induced shock wave eﬀect and the related mechanism of radiation damage in
cells.
