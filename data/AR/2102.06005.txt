ABSTRACT

Aims. We investigate the conﬁguration of a complex ﬂux rope above the δ sunspot region in NOAA AR 11515, and its eruptive
expansion during a conﬁned M5.3-class ﬂare.
Methods. We study the formation of the δ sunspot using the continuum intensity images and photospheric vector magnetograms
provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We employ the extreme-
ultraviolet and ultraviolet images provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO, and the hard X-ray emission
recorded by the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager to investigate the eruptive details. The coronal magnetic
ﬁeld is extrapolated from the photospheric ﬁeld using a non-linear force free ﬁeld (NLFFF) method, based on which the ﬂux rope
is identiﬁed through calculating the twist number Tw and squashing factor Q. We search the null point via a modiﬁed Powell hybrid
method.
Results. The collision between two newly emerged spot groups form the δ sunspot. A bald patch (BP) conﬁguration forms at the
collision location between one umbra and the penumbra, above which a complex ﬂux rope structure is identiﬁed. The ﬂux rope has a
multi-layer conﬁguration, with one compact end and the other end bifurcating into diﬀerent branches, having non-uniform Tw proﬁle
which decreases from the core to the boundary. The outmost layer is merely sheared. A null point is located above the ﬂux rope.
The eruptive process consists of precursor ﬂarings at a “v”-shaped coronal structure, rise of the ﬁlament, and brightening below the
ﬁlament, corresponding well with the topological structures deduced from the NLFFF, including a higher null point, a ﬂux rope, and
a BP and a hyperbolic ﬂux tube (HFT) below the ﬂux rope. Two sets of post-ﬂare loops and three ﬂare ribbons in the δ sunspot region
further support the bifurcation conﬁguration of the ﬂux rope.
Conclusions. Combining the observations and magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation, we conclude that the precursor reconnection, which
occurs at the null point, weakens the overlying conﬁnement to allow the ﬂux rope to rise, ﬁtting the breakout model. The main phase
reconnection, which may occur at the BP or HFT, facilitates the ﬂux rope rising. The results suggest that the δ spot conﬁguration
presents an environment prone to the formation of complex magnetic conﬁgurations which will work together to produce activities.

1. Introduction

Sunspots appear as dark spots on the photosphere in white light
observation, reﬂecting the convection inhibition caused by the
concentrations of strong magnetic ﬂux which constitute the so-
lar active regions (ARs). They usually appear as groups, exhibit-
ing various conﬁgurations. The most complex type is called δ
sunspot, which is manifested as two umbrae of opposite polar-
ities sharing a common penumbra (Künzel 1960). Observations
reveal that regions harboring δ spots are productive in solar ﬂares
and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (Shi & Wang 1994; Sammis
et al. 2000; Takizawa & Kitai 2015; Toriumi et al. 2016; Tori-
umi & Wang 2019), which are the two most spectacular phe-
nomena in solar atmosphere. A few common features observed
in δ spot regions are considered to account for their high pro-
ductivity. For example, the opposite-signed polarities in these

regions tend to be stronger and compact, forming high-gradient,
strongly-sheared polarity inversion lines (PILs), which indeed
indicate the non-potentiality of the magnetic ﬁeld (Hagyard et al.
1984; Tanaka 1991; Schrijver 2007). Shearing motions along the
PILs and sunspot rotations also frequently appear. They are sug-
gested to be able to shear or twist the ﬁeld (Hagyard et al. 1984;
Leka et al. 1996; Fan 2009; Yan et al. 2015). The non-potential
magnetic ﬁeld, in combination with photospheric motions, may
create an environment apt to the magnetic reconnections and
eruptions (Fang & Fan 2015).

The formation conditions of δ spots are summarized into
three categories by Zirin & Margaret (1987): they can form when
intertwined bipoles emerge at once, when satellite spots emerge
into pre-existent spot regions, and when diﬀerent spot groups
collide. Numerical simulations suggest that the formation of δ

spots is resulted from the emergence of twisted magnetic ﬂux
tubes from the convection zone, which can induce shearing mo-
tions and sunspot rotations self-consistently (Leka et al. 1996;
Fang & Fan 2015; Toriumi & Hotta 2019). After formation, the
coronal counterparts of δ spot regions exhibit complex conﬁgu-
rations as well, sometimes are in the form of sigmoidal structures
which are considered as coronal proxies of the magnetic ﬂux
rope (e.g., Joshi et al. 2018). The ﬂux rope is a magnetic struc-
ture consisting of a set of helical ﬁeld lines collectively wrapping
around an axis with more than one full turn (Cheng et al. 2017,
and reference therein).

It is suggested that the magnetic ﬂux rope is a fundamen-
tal structure in solar eruptions (Liu 2020, and reference therein).
For example, although ﬂares and CMEs appear diﬀerently, with
the former being local enhancements of electromagnetic ra-
diation and the latter being more global expulsions of mag-
netized plasma, they are suggested to be diﬀerent manifesta-
tions of a same process involving the eruption of magnetic ﬂux
ropes (Forbes 2000). In the classical two-dimensional (2D) sce-
nario of the standard ﬂare model, the ﬂux rope erupts to form
the main body of the CME, generating current sheet at the CME
wake through stretching the strapping ﬁeld. The reconnection
manifested as ﬂare occurs at the current sheet (Carmichael 1964;
STURROCK 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976;
Shibata et al. 1995). The standard ﬂare model has been extended
to the three-dimensional (3D) space (Aulanier et al. 2012; Jan-
vier et al. 2013), in which the current sheet where the ﬂare occurs
is suggested to be formed around the hyperbolic ﬂux tube (HFT,
Titov et al. 2003). The exact trigger of the eruption is explained
by other models that can be roughly divided into two categories:
magnetic reconnection model and ideal Magnetohydrodynam-
ics (MHD) instability model (Chen 2011, and reference therein).
For the former, magnetic reconnection may occur above the
sheared arcades at the null point as in the breakout model (Anti-
ochos et al. 1999), or below the sheared arcades as in the tether-
cutting model (Moore et al. 2001). In these scenarios, the ﬂux
rope forms on the ﬂy. On the contrast, pre-existent ﬂux rope is
usually required in ideal MHD instability models, such as kink
instability and torus instability models (Török et al. 2004; Kliem
& Török 2006). The above models are supported by observa-
tions (Cheng et al. 2017, and reference therein).

Observationally, we are not able to “see” the coronal ﬂux
rope directly since there is no direct measurement of the coro-
nal magnetic ﬁeld at present. A few observable entities such as
sigmoids (Canﬁeld et al. 1999), ﬁlaments (Martin 1998) and hot
channels (Zhang et al. 2012), are considered as proxies of the
ﬂux ropes (Liu 2020, and reference therein). In situ observations
of interplanetary magnetic clouds also give hint to the conﬁgura-
tion of the ﬂux ropes (Hu et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2018a). On the
other hand, various methods are developed to reconstruct the 3D
coronal magnetic ﬁeld (Guo et al. 2017; Wiegelmann et al. 2017,
and references therein), based on which one can locate and ana-
lyze the ﬂux rope (Liu et al. 2016). It is found that the ﬂux rope in
reconstructed ﬁeld presents as strong twisted regions wrapped by
a boundary of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs, Titov 2007), which
in fact is natural according to the deﬁnition of the magnetic ﬂux
rope (Liu et al. 2016). Besides the coherent structure of one ﬂux
rope, the ﬁeld lines of which have similar rotational patterns (Liu
et al. 2016), more complex conﬁgurations are found in the ARs,
such as double-decker conﬁguration with one ﬂux rope atop the
other one (Kliem et al. 2014), intertwined double-decker ﬂux
rope (Mitra et al. 2020), braided ﬂux ropes (Awasthi et al. 2018),
co-existent ﬂux rope and sheared arcade in one ﬁlament (Guo
et al. 2010), etc.

Overall, δ sunspot which indicates a non-potential conﬁgu-
ration, and ﬂux rope which is a highly non-potential structure
in the corona, both play important role in solar eruptions. De-
tailed study of the magnetic ﬂux rope in δ sunspot region, in-
cluding its formation, conﬁguration and eruption, and moreover,
the role that δ spot conﬁguration plays in above process, is nec-
essary in understanding solar eruptions. A few observations do
have related the two explicitly. Jiang et al. (2012) reported that a
highly twisted ﬁlament channel was formed above the δ sunspot
in NOAA AR 11158. With the aid of coronal ﬁeld extrapola-
tion, Mitra et al. (2018) also found that the ﬂux ropes succes-
sively erupted from AR 12673 were formed in the δ sunspot of
the AR. In this work, we investigate the conﬁguration and failed
eruption of a complex ﬂux rope structure above the central δ spot
of AR 11515. The AR is very proliﬁc in ﬂares and CMEs and
has been intensively studied (Louis et al. 2014; Jing et al. 2014;
Wang et al. 2014, 2018b). The ﬂux rope we studied is related
to a conﬁned M5.3-class ﬂare occurred on 2012 July 4. The pa-
per is structured as follows: in the next section, we describe the
data and method used. The results are presented in Section 3. We
discuss the implication of this work in Section 4.

2. Data Analysis

We use the photospheric continuum intensity maps and vector
magnetograms provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Im-
ager (HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory) (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012) to investigate the evo-
lution of the δ sunspot. HMI generates the vector magnetograms
with a plate scale of 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 5 and a cadence of 12 minutes, based
on which the ARs are automatically extracted and tracked. Here
the data segment deprojected to cylindrical equal area (CEA)
coordinate is used (Bobra et al. 2014). The data segment is re-
leased as HMI.sharp_cea_720s series (Hoeksema et al. 2014).
Using the ﬁeld data, we calculate the unsigned magnetic ﬂux via
Φ = (cid:82)
|Bz|ds, in which Bz is the vertical component of the mag-
netic ﬁeld, and ds is the area of the pixel. Since the magnetic ﬁeld
measurement suﬀers from severe projection eﬀect when near the
solar limb (Petrie 2015), we only calculate Φ when the AR is not
far from the disk center, i.e., in the region between the Stonyhurst
longitude 60◦E to 60◦W.

s

We employ the ultraviolet (UV) and extreme-ultraviolet
(EUV) images provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assem-
bly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) onboard SDO to inspect the details
of the M5.3-class ﬂare. The data has a plate scale of 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 6 and a
cadence up to 12s. The hard X-ray (HXR) emission of the ﬂare
is recorded by the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectro-
scopic Imager (RHESSI, Lin et al. 2002). We use the detectors
1F, 3F, 4F, 5F, 6F, 7F and 8F to reconstruct the HXR sources at
12-25 KeV by the Clean algorithm (Hurford et al. 2002).

We study the coronal magnetic ﬁeld of the region by extrap-
olating the photospheric vector magnetogram using a non-linear
force free ﬁeld (NLFFF) method (Wiegelmann 2004; Wiegel-
mann et al. 2012). Since the photosphere is not necessarily force-
free, the photospheric magnetogram used as the input of the ex-
trapolation needs to be preprocessed to reduce possible force,
torque, and other noises (Wiegelmann et al. 2006). Three dimen-
sionless parameters, the ﬂux balance parameter, the force bal-
ance parameter, and the torque balance parameter, are calculated
to quantify the quality of the preprocessed magnetogram. We
also calculate the fractional ﬂux ratio and the weighted angle be-
tween current (J) and magnetic ﬁeld (B) to check the divergence-
freeness and force-freeness of the extrapolated ﬁeld (Derosa
et al. 2015).

Based on the extrapolated ﬁeld, we calculate the twist num-
ber Tw and squashing factor Q using the code1 developed by Liu
et al. (2016) to identify the ﬂux rope, the cross section of which
is manifested as areas of high Tw wrapped by high Q bound-
aries (Liu et al. 2016). Tw measures the number of turns that
two extremely close ﬁeld lines wind about each other, and is
computed through equation Tw = 1
4π
2006; Liu et al. 2016), in which α denotes the force free pa-
rameter and dl denotes the elementary length of the ﬁeld line.
Q quantiﬁes the local gradient of the magnetic connectivity.
For an arbitrary ﬁeld line, its two footpoints deﬁne a map-

Bn,1(x1, y1) and Bn,2(x2, y2) are components perpendicular to the
plane of the footpoints (Titov et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2016). High
Q regions usually indicate the QSLs, a thin volume where the
connectivity of magnetic ﬁeld lines has drastic change. The elec-
tric current is easily to be accumulated at the QSLs, favoring
of magnetic reconnection. For a coherent ﬂux rope possessing
some degree of cylindrical symmetry, we can further take the
ﬁeld line owning the extremum Tw of the ﬂux rope as a reliable
proxy of its axis (Liu et al. 2016). We also search the null point
through solving the equation Bi(x, y, z) = 0, in which i = x, y, z,
using a modiﬁed Powell hybrid method2 (Demoulin et al. 1994).
We then visualize the NLFFF ﬁeld lines via a software named
as PARAVIEW3, which provides an interactive environment for
visualization.

3. Results

3.1. Formation of the δ sunspot

When appears at the east limb on 2012 June 27, NOAA AR
11515 is already developed with a complex βγ conﬁguration. It
has unsigned magnetic ﬂux as large as 3.5×1022 Mx when pass-
ing the Stonyhurst longitude 60◦E on 2012 June 28 (see Fig-
ure 1(a)). About 3 days later, a new episode of ﬂux emergence
initiates in the western part of the AR, which transports more
than 4.5×1022 Mx to the AR before it rotates out of the view.
During the emergence, a δ sunspot is formed in the middle of the
AR (Figure 1(b)-(c)). An M5.3 class ﬂare, accompanied by the
failed eruption of a ﬁlament, takes place in the δ sunspot region
from 09:47 to 09:57 UT on 2012 July 04 (Figure 1(d)-(f)). The
reason for the failure of the eruption has been studied in Li et al.
(2019). Here we mainly focus on the formation of the δ sunspot,
the detailed conﬁguration of the pre-eruption ﬂux rope and the
magnetic topology accounting for the eruption characteristics.

While the ﬂux emergence starts from 2012 July 01, the δ
sunspot is not formed until 2012 July 04. We present the emer-
gence period relevant to the spot formation in Figure 2. On July
03, a newly emerged bipole, bipole1, has drifted from the west
to the middle of the AR (Figure 2(a1)), followed by another
small bipole, bipole2. The two polarities of bipole1 (N1 and
P1) are observed as developed sunspots consisting of the um-
bra and penumbra in the continuum image (Figure 2(a2)), while
the two polarities of bipole2 (N2 and P2) are presented as pores.

3 https://www.paraview.org/

As emergence goes on, the polarity N2 moves to the east, and ﬁ-
nally collides with P1 (Figure 2(b1-e1)). After collision, the ﬂux
emergence continues. Due to the existence of N2, some newly
emerged positive ﬂux of bipole1 forms a small patch that is
isolated from the original P1, being located at the north of N2.
We call the new patch as P2
1 (indicated by a cyan arrow in Fig-
ure 2(f1-h1)), and the old, large P1 as P1
1 (Figure 2 (f1-h1)). P2
1
appears as a patch of penumbra in the continuum image (Fig-
ure 2(f2-h2)). Simultaneously, N2 also develops into a sunspot
in the continuum image, which together with P1
1 form
the δ sunspot conﬁguration (enclosed by the red circle in Fig-
ure 2(h2)). Note that P2 is still dispersed, consisting of small
ﬂux patches that appear as small pores in the continuum image.

1 and P2

We further select a moment (2012-07-04T09:22 UT) to inves-
tigate the pre-ﬂare magnetic condition above the δ sunspot re-
gion. The photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld and the extrapo-
lated coronal ﬁeld are checked, shown in Figure 3 to Figure 5.
We ﬁnd a sheared PIL formed between P2
1 and the group of N1
and N2 (green line in Figure 3(a)), which is obtained via draw-
ing the contour of Bz = 0 on the Bz map directly. The pixels of
the PIL all have shear angle (S ) larger than 55◦ (Figure 3(b)),
indicating the high non-potentiality here. S is the angle between
observed ﬁeld (BObs) and the potential ﬁeld (BPot), calculated
by S = cos−1(

) (Bobra et al. 2014). The potential

BObs · BPot
|BObs||BPot|

ﬁeld is computed by a frourier transformation method (Alissan-
drakis 1981). Moreover, we ﬁnd a bald patch (BP) formed at
the interface between N2 and P2
1 (yellow dots in Figure 3 (a)),
i.e., between one umbra and the penumbra of the δ spot. BP is
a conﬁguration at which the ﬁeld lines are tangent to the pho-
tosphere and concaved up, showing a inverse conﬁguration that
points from the negative polarity to the positive polarity (see blue
vectors in Figure 3 (a)). It can be identiﬁed through the discrimi-
nant (Bh · ∇hBz)|PIL > 0 (Titov et al. 1993, see Figure 3(b) here),
where Bh and Bz denote the horizontal and vertical components
of the magnetic ﬁeld. BP usually belongs to the bald patch sepa-
ratrix surface (BPSS), which is prone to the formation of a ﬂux
rope. Such conﬁguration is found to be preferred location for
current accumulation in the corona and thus magnetic reconnec-
tion (Titov & Démoulin 1999).

We then search for the ﬂux rope in the extrapolated NLFFF.
The quality of the preprocessed photospheric magnetogram is
ﬁrstly checked. The values of the dimensionless parameters (see
Section 2) are presented in Table 1. It is found that the value of
the ﬂux balance parameter slightly increases after preprocessing,
but is still of the order of 10−2, indicating that the magnetic ﬂux
of the magnetogram is basically balanced, either before or after
the preprocessing. The values of the force balance and torque
balance parameters are of the order of 10−2 after preprocessing,
decreasing by an order of magnitude compared to the values be-
fore preprocessing, suggesting that the force and torque on the
magnetogram are signiﬁcantly reduced. We also check the qual-
ity of the extrapolation. It is found that the value of the fractional
ﬂux ratio is 2.03 × 10−3, and the weighted angle between J and
B is 9.07◦. While the former value is small, the latter is about
2◦ larger than the values of some reported NLFFF results (Liu
et al. 2017; Mitra et al. 2020). Nevertheless, both values are not
large, suggesting that the degree of the divergence-freeness and
force-freeness of the extrapolation is acceptable.

We do ﬁnd a ﬂux rope structure (shown in Figure 4(a)-(b))
above the δ spot region through checking the Tw and Q distri-
butions in a series of vertical planes across the PIL. The ﬂux
rope displays a complex conﬁguration consisting of diﬀerent
branches, with one compact end rooted in N1, and the other end
bifurcating into diﬀerent branches that are rooted in P1
1, discrete
ﬂux patches of P2, and also part of the periphery of the pre-
existent PA. In the following, we call the branch rooted in P1
1
as the southern branch of the ﬂux rope (indicated by a pink rect-
angle in Figure 4(a)), since P1
1 is located in the southern part of
the AR, and the ones rooted in P2 and PA (enclosed in a yel-
low rectangle) as northern branches. The bottom of the ﬂux rope
touches the photosphere at the BP between N2 and P2
1 (see the
ﬁeld lines passing through the BP in Figure 4(b1)). We further
try to identify the axis of the ﬂux rope through inspecting the
local extremums of the Tw maps. A ﬁeld line possessing the lo-
cal maximum in all Tw maps we inspected is found, which may
be deemed as the proxy of the ﬂux rope axis (Liu et al. 2016).
Q, Tw, and the in-plane ﬁeld vectors in a vertical plane normal to
the tangent line of the apex (local peak of a curve) of the possible
axis proxy are displayed in Figure 4(c)-(e). Unsurprisingly, the
cross section of the ﬂux rope is manifested as the strong twisted
region wrapped by high Q boundary. Moreover, it exhibits more
complex, onion-like conﬁguration, consisting of diﬀerent layers
that are separated by diﬀerent high Q boundaries. The most of
the in plane ﬁeld vectors are found rotating around the possi-
ble axis proxy (denoted by the red triangles in Figure 4), ex-
cepting the ones below the possible axis. This may be because
that the ﬂux rope owns bifurcated ends, which indicates that it
is not strictly coherent, so that there may exist a few ﬁeld lines
which have slightly diﬀerent rotational patterns from the other
ﬁeld lines at some locations. We also compare the ﬂux rope and
the ﬁlament observed in AIA 304 Å passband (Figure 4(f)). It is
found that the eastern part of the ﬂux rope coincides with the ﬁla-
ment to a large extent. The western part of the ﬁlament is covered
by higher loops, which makes the direct comparison unachiev-
able. Moreover, we ﬁnd two sets of loops in the AIA 131 Å pass-
band, which overlie the southern and northern branches of the
ﬂux rope, respectively (Figure 4(g)).

We further check the detailed properties of each layer of the
ﬂux rope (Figure 5). Typical ﬁeld lines of each layer are ran-
domly chosen to show. It is found that Tw decreases gradually
from the core to the boundary. The core layer (layer 5), where
the possible axis proxy threads, owns the largest twist with al-
most uniform Tw as high as −3.8 (Figure 5(b)). The ﬁeld lines of
the layer are rooted in the polarities N1 and P4
2 (see the blue line
in Figure 5). The outer layer, layer 4, has lower Tw roughly rang-
ing from −3 to −2.7. The ﬁeld lines of this layer originate from
the polarity P3
2, then go into N1 (see the green line in Figure 5).
Some of the ﬁeld lines further pass though P2
1 and N2 (the BP).
Layer 3 has Tw ranging from −3 to −1.5. Its ﬁeld lines span the
longest distance, rooted in polarities N1 and remote P2
2 (see the
orange line in Figure 5). Layer 2 owns Tw in the range of −2.4
to −1. Its ﬁeld lines are found rooted in N1 and P1
2 (see the pink
line in Figure 5). Some of the ﬁeld lines also pass through the BP.
The outermost layer (layer 1) is the least twisted part, having Tw
ranging from −0.9 to −0.5 (see the red line in Figure 5). Its ﬁeld
lines are rooted in polarities N1 and P1
1, with some of them also
passing through the BP. They indeed do not meet the criterion
of the ﬁeld lines belonging to a typical ﬂux rope, which should
wind at least one full turn. However, they are intertwined with
the more twisted inner layers, together forming an inseparable
whole structure. We thus call this structure a complex ﬂux rope.

3.3. Topological origin of the eruption characteristics

The ﬂare is accompanied by the failed eruption of a ﬁlament.
Taking the ﬁlament as a proxy of the ﬂux rope, its failed erup-
tion suggests that the ﬂux rope experiences an eruptive expan-
sion during the ﬂare. The Lorentz force during the eruption is
non-zero, making the in-eruption NLFFF extrapolation unreli-
able. We thus check the eruption characteristics observed in var-
ious passbands to deduce the eruptive details of the ﬂux rope.
We select three AIA passbands, the hot 131 Å (∼10 MK), cool
304 Å (∼50000 K), and the UV 1600 Å (∼10000 K) to show
the eruptive details (Figure 6). The GOES soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂux
shows that the ﬂare starts from 07-04T09:47 UT, peaks at 09:55,
and ends at 09:57 (Figure 1(d)). Besides, from around 09:35 to
09:47, a small “bump” appears on the SXR curve (Figure 1(d)),
suggesting that some mild ﬂarings, i.e., a phase of mild recon-
nection occurs prior to the recorded ﬂare. This kind of gradual
buildup of the SXR ﬂux prior to the main ﬂare, which is distinct
from the rapid increasing of the SXR ﬂux during the main ﬂare,
is called a precursor phase (Zhang & Dere 2006; Mitra & Joshi
2019). Furtherly, in the hot 131 Å passband (Figure 6(a1)-(b1)),
an inclined “v”-shaped structure brightens. The structure seems
to consist of two sets of loops, with two far sides rooted in P1
1
and dispersed P2, and the other two close sides somehow inter-
secting at higher altitude to form the cusp of the “v” (Figure 6
(a1)). In the RHESSI observation, an HXR source at the 12-25
keV energy bands is found to be centered at the cusp. The EUV
brightening and HXR source further support that there is a phase
of precursor reconnection occurring prior to the main ﬂare. We
call this phase of reconnection as reconnection1.

After the precursor brightening, a ﬁlament bundle starts to
rise slowly from around 09:46 (see Figure 6(c2)-(d2) and as-
sociated movie). The footpoints of the ﬁlament brighten dur-
ing the rise, forming an HXR source at the eastern footpoint
(Figure 6(d2)). From around 09:52, another brightening occurs
below the rising ﬁlament, which is visible in both 131 Å and
304 Å passbands, as well as in the 1600 Å passband, forming
a new HXR source (Figure 6(e1)). This is the main phase re-
connection generating the peak SXR ﬂux of the ﬂare. We call
this phase of reconnection as reconnection2. Following recon-
nection2, the ﬁlament continues to rise and ﬁnally stops without
forming a CME. After the failed eruption, two sets of nearly-
potential post-ﬂare loops appear above the δ spot region, with
one set connecting P2 (also part of the periphery of PA) and
the group of N1 and N2 (enclosed in a yellow rectangle in Fig-
ure 6(f1)), and the other set connecting P1
1 and the group of N1
and N2 (enclosed in a pink rectangle in Figure 6(f1)). Three
elongated ribbons appear at the footpoints of the loops in the
1600 Å passband (Figure 6(f3)). Besides, there is a remote rib-
bon brightening during the ﬂare, located at the east of the AR,
which seems to be connected with the core region by some
sheared loops (Figure 6(d1) and (d3)).

The inclined “v”-shaped structure, which shows an HXR
source centered at its cusp during the ﬂare, strongly suggests
that there might be a null point. We thus search the pre-eruption
NLFFFs using the method described in Section 2, and do ﬁnd a
null point above the ﬂux rope (Figure 7). The conﬁguration of
the null point is very similar to the classical null associated with
fans and spines (Priest & Titov 1996). The outer spine here is
rooted in the remote negative polarity, while the inner spine is
rooted in N2. The only exception here is that the ﬁeld lines of the
fans are rooted in two disconnected polarity patches, P1
1 and P2,
diﬀerent from the circular fan of the classical conﬁguration. The

Lijuan Liu et al.: The conﬁguration and failed eruption of a complex magnetic ﬂux rope above a δ sunspot region

null is manifested as the intersection of two high Q lines (indi-
cated by a red star in Figure 7(c)) in a vertical plane across it.
Moreover, the ﬂux rope is exhibited as a inverse teardrop-shaped
structure in this plane, similar as in Figure 4, but having an HFT
conﬁguration at its bottom. HFT is a conﬁguration where two
QSLs intersect, prone to current accumulation, thus reconnec-
tion (Titov et al. 2003).

We further show the AIA observations and the magnetic
topological structures together in Figure 8 to better understand
the eruptive process. The “v”-shaped structure in the 131 Å im-
age (shown in red in Figure 8(a)), i.e., the location where the ﬁrst
phase of the reconnection occurs, generally coincides with the
null point identiﬁed in the reconstructed coronal NLFFFs (Fig-
ure 8(b)). The only diﬀerence is that the sheared loops connect-
ing the core region and the remote region in the 131 Å pass-
band deviate from the outer spine in the NLFFFs. The former
are rooted in the more northern part of the remote negative po-
larity, while the latter is rooted in more southern region. This
may be resulted from the limitations of the NLFFF model, and
the projection eﬀect since the NLFFF image is in the CEA co-
ordinate while the AIA images are in the CCD coordinate. The
main phase reconnection seems to occur below the null point
(show in green in Figure 8(a)). The position of the two sets of
post-ﬂare loops (shown in blue in Figure 8(a)) and the three
main ﬂare ribbons (white contours in Figure 8(a)) correspond
well with the bifurcated branches of the pre-eruption ﬂux rope.
Speciﬁcally, the northern set of the post-ﬂare loops connects P2
(also part of the periphery of PA) and the group of N1 and N2,
while the northern branches of the ﬂux rope are also rooted in P2
and N1, passing through N2 at the BP (Figure 8(b)). The south-
ern set of the loops connects P1
1 and the group of N1 and N2,
while the southern branch of the ﬂux rope is also rooted in P1
1
and N1 (also passing through N2). The three ribbons are located
in P2 (also part of the periphery of PA), the group of N1 and N2,
and P1
1 as well. These suggest that the bifurcated ﬂux rope is
involved in the failed eruption. The ejective expansion of diﬀer-
ent branches of the ﬂux rope stretches diﬀerent sets of strapping
ﬁeld (see Figure 4(g)), forming two sets of post-ﬂare loops and
three ﬂare ribbons which are rooted near the footpoints of the
ﬂux rope branches. The results support that the extrapolated bi-
furcated ﬂux rope generally coincides with the observation.

We also present the time-distance diagram of a slice (white
dotted line in Figure 8(a)) extracted from the 131 Å images
to better see the sequence of the eruption characteristics (Fig-
ure 8(c)). The slice runs across the ﬁlament. It is seen that before
the ﬁlament rising, there is a phase of mild brightenings occur-
ring above the ﬁlament, which corresponds to the precursor re-
connection at the null. After the start of the ﬁlament rising, a
second phase of strong ﬂarings occurs below the ﬁlament, which
apparently corresponds to the main phase reconnection. The di-
agram conﬁrms the sequence of the eruption characteristics, i.e.,
reconnection1 occurs at the null at ﬁrst, followed by the rise of
the ﬁlament, and then reconnection2 occurs below the ﬁlament,
after which the ﬁlament continues to rise and ﬁnally stops. These
suggest that the trigger of the failed eruption is more likely to be
the breakout reconnection at the null, which weakens the con-
ﬁnement of the strapping ﬁeld and causes the rise of the ﬁlament.
The main phase reconnection occurring below the ﬁlament gives
positive feedback to the rising ﬁlament. Since the main recon-
nection is visible in various passbands, even in 1600 Å which
monitors the photosphere and the lower chromosphere, it is very
possible that it occurs rather low, might be associated with the
pre-existent BPSS or the HFT below the ﬂux rope.

4. Summary and Discussion

In this work, via combining the multiple wavelengths observa-
tions and the coronal magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation, we investi-
gate the conﬁguration of a complex ﬂux rope structure in NOAA
AR 11515, and its failed eruption during a conﬁned M5.3-class
ﬂare. It is found that the ﬂux rope is formed right above the δ
spot region, consisting of multiple layers, with its cross section
exhibiting an onion-like conﬁguration. Above the ﬂux rope, a
null point is identiﬁed. The eruption process suggests that the
precursor reconnection occurs at the null point, which is mani-
fested as a inclined “v”-shaped structure. It weakens the overly-
ing conﬁnement, causing the slow rise of the ﬂux rope which is
indicated by a ﬁlament. The main phase of reconnection occurs
below the ﬂux rope, probably at the BPSS or HFT, facilitating
the rise of the ﬂux rope. The eruptive expansion of the ﬂux rope
ﬁnally stops without forming a CME.

The δ sunspot is formed through the collision between two
spot groups which are newly emerged near the pre-existent spot
regions (PA). The collision occurs between one umbra and the
penumbra which become part of the δ sunspot later. A bald patch
conﬁguration is found formed at the collision location. The iden-
tiﬁed ﬂux rope is attached to the photosphere at the BP (see
Figure 4(b1)). The result suggests that the δ sunspot conﬁgura-
tion, where two umbrae are located close in the same penum-
bra that contain opposite-signed polarities huddling together,
naturally creates an environment prone to the formation of the
ﬂux rope. The detailed formation of the ﬂux rope is beyond the
scope of this paper. We do not identify ﬂux ropes in extrapo-
lated coronal ﬁeld before 09:00 on July 4, but do ﬁnd a smaller
ﬂare (C9.7-class) that occurs from around 09:00 to 09:09, during
which small-scale brightenings are observed in the BP region in
1600 Å, accompanied by brightenings of nearby coronal loops
(visible in 131 Å) which are associated with two other small rib-
bons (see the movie associated with Figure 6). It is suggested
that the ﬂux rope may be formed or built-up in conﬁned ﬂares
prior to large eruptions (Guo et al. 2013; Joshi et al. 2016; James
et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2018a, 2019), most probably via magnetic
reconnection between diﬀerent sheared loops in a tether-cutting
manner (Syntelis et al. 2019). Therefore, the ﬂux rope here may
be formed through small-scale reconnection between diﬀerent
sheared ﬁeld lines near the BPSS.

The ﬂux rope consists of multiple layers, exhibiting an
onion-like conﬁguration in the Tw and Q maps of its cross sec-
tion. One of the ﬂux rope end is compact, rooted in one negative
polarity, while the other end bifurcates into diﬀerent branches
rooted in discrete positive polarity patches, indicating that the
connectivities of the diﬀerent branches change drastically to
form the QSLs around each layer. The twist proﬁle of the ﬂux
rope is not uniform, with Tw decreasing from the core to the
boundary. The core has a twist as high as 3.8 turns. This is
consistent with some in-situ observations of interplanetary mag-
netic clouds, which exhibit highly twisted core enclosed by a less
twisted envelope (Hu et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2018a). The out-
most layer of the ﬂux rope here has twist less than one full turn,
which indeed is “sheared” rather than “twisted”. This is similar
to the observation reported in Guo et al. (2010), in which a ﬂux
rope and sheared arcade sections are found coexisting along one
ﬁlament. The diﬀerence here is that the sheared layer is inter-
twined with the other twisted branches of the ﬂux rope, forming
a complex structure. Similar but diﬀerent conﬁgurations of com-
plex ﬂux rope have been reported. For example, Awasthi et al.
(2018) identiﬁed a complex structure consisting of multiple ﬂux
ropes or ﬂux bundles braiding about each other in extrapolated

NLFFFs. Hou et al. (2018) also concluded that a multi-ﬂux-rope
system is formed through interactions between diﬀerent emerg-
ing dipoles. Overall, the observations suggest that the ﬂux rope
in δ sunspot region, or more generally, in multi-polar regions,
may have quite complex conﬁguration due to the interaction be-
tween adjacent polarities, may be diﬀerent from the simple con-
ﬁguration of a single coherent ﬂux rope in bipolar regions. The
latter is often presented in numerical simulations (e.g., Gibson
et al. 2004; Aulanier et al. 2010).

Since the NLFFF assumption does not stand during the ﬂare,
we compare the pre-eruption magnetic condition and the erup-
tion characteristics observed by various passbands to deduce the
details of the eruptive expansion of the ﬂux rope. The “v”-shaped
structure that brightens prior to the rise of the ﬁlament corre-
sponds well with the null point identiﬁed in the NLFFFs, sug-
gesting a precursor phase of reconnection occurs at the null,
which is also evidenced by the mild enhancement of the SXR
ﬂux and the HXR source at the cusp of the “v”. The precursor
may have triggered the ﬂux rope to rise via weakening the con-
ﬁnement of the overlying ﬁeld, ﬁtting the breakout model. This
is consistent with previous works, which suggest that the pre-
cursor activities, which are associated with small-scale recon-
nection, have potential to destabilize the ﬂux rope (Sterling &
Moore 2005; Sterling et al. 2011; Joshi et al. 2013; Mitra & Joshi
2019). Moreover, the inner spine and the fans associated with the
null point are rooted in the polarities forming the δ spot, again
addresses the important role that the δ spot plays in creating the
topology favoring of reconnection and eruption.

During the main phase of the ﬂare, three parallel ribbons
are formed in the polarities where the extrapolated ﬂux rope is
rooted, followed by the formation of post-ﬂare loops. The HXR
sources are also found at the footpoint of the ﬁlament and the
looptop. These features are all predicted by the 2D standard
ﬂare model (see Section 1 for introduction), suggesting that the
ﬂare ﬁts the standard ﬂare model. Moreover, the ﬂaring is vis-
ible even in UV observations, suggesting that the reconnection
occurs rather low. Considering that there are BP and rather low
HFT conﬁgurations at the bottom of the ﬂux rope, which are
prone to magnetic reconnection, the main phase ﬂare is very
possible to be associated with those topology. This is not con-
ﬂicting to the standard ﬂare model since in the 3D extension of
the standard model (Aulanier et al. 2012; Janvier et al. 2013),
the elongated current layer surrounding the HFT is thought to be
an analogy to the current sheet formed between two legs of the
strapping ﬁeld in the 2D model.

Note that the ﬂare is conﬁned. The reason for the failure of
the eruption has been investigated by Li et al. (2019). Through
calculating the decay index which measures the conﬁnement of
the strapping ﬁeld above the eruption region, they concluded
that a “saddle-like” distribution of the decay index, which is ex-
hibited as a local torus-stale region sandwiched by two torus-
unstable regions (Wang et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2018b), is respon-
sible to the failed eruption. The local torus-stable region may
have prevented the ﬂux rope from a full eruption.

The multi-layer conﬁguration of the ﬂux rope may also give
hint to the origin of homologous eruptions. Homologous erup-
tions originate from the same magnetic source region, having
similar appearance (Zhang & Wang 2002; Liu et al. 2017). It
is suggested that those eruptions may be resulted from partial
expulsions of the ﬂux rope (Gibson & Fan 2006; Cheng et al.
2018). Although the ﬂux rope studied here seems to expand as a
whole, we cannot exclude the possibility that in some occasions,
internal reconnections may occur at the distinct QSLs, resulting

in independent eruptions of diﬀerent layers, thus partial erup-
tions of the ﬂux rope.

To summarize, the ﬂux rope we studied is formed right above
the δ spot region, being attached at the interface between one
umbra and the penumbra, owning multi-layer conﬁguration with
twist decreasing from the core to the boundary. The eruptive ex-
pansion of the ﬂux rope is triggered by the precursor reconnec-
tion at the null point, and facilitated by the main phase recon-
nection at the BPSS or HFT. The results give details about how
complex magnetic topological structures formed in the δ spot
region work together to produce the activities.

Fig. 3. The bald patch between N2 and P2
1. (a) The photospheric vector magnetogram of the BP region. The FOV of this panel is indicated by
the green box in Figure 2(h1). The Bz component of the ﬁeld is plotted as the background, saturating at ±600 G. The red (blue) arrows denote
the horizontal component (Bh) of the ﬁeld that are corresponding to the positive (negative) polarities. The green line indicates the PIL between
1 and the group of N1 and N2, which is obtained at the contour line of Bz = 0. The yellow parts of the PIL mark the BP section. (b) Values of
P2
(Bh · ∇hBz)|PIL (shown in green) and the shear angle S (shown in magenta) of all pixels along the PIL. The two vertical-dashed lines in (b) enclose
the BP region.

Fig. 4. The conﬁguration of the ﬂux rope that is identiﬁed in the extrapolated NLFFFs. (a)-(b) The ﬂux rope seen from two diﬀerent views. The
iridescence colors vary with the strength of the ﬁeld. Panel (a) has the same FOV as Figure 2. The inset (b1) shows the ﬁeld lines passing through
the BP speciﬁcally. The yellow-dashed rectangle marks the northern branches of the ﬂux rope, while the pink one is for the southern branch.
The photospheric Bz saturates at ±2000 G in these panels, with white (black) patches indicating the positive (negative) polarities. (c)-(e) The
distribution of logarithmic Q, Tw, and in-plane ﬁeld vector in a vertical plane which is perpenduclar to the local apex of the possible axis proxy.
The red triangles indicate the local extremum of Tw, i.e., the location where the possible axis proxy threads the plane. The position of the plane
is indicated by the semi-transparent cut in panel (b). (f) The image of the AIA 304 Å passband, showing the ﬁlament. The white line denotes the
estimated axis of the ﬂux rope from NLFFFs. (g) The image of the AIA 131 Å passband, showing two sets of loops overlying the northern and
southern branches of the ﬂux rope. The colored dashed rectangles enclose the same regions as the ones in panel (a). Panels (a), (f), and (g) have
the same FOV.

Fig. 5. Diﬀerent layers of the ﬂux rope. (a) Representative ﬁeld line from each layer. The panels has the same FOV as Figure 2. The photospheric
Bz saturates at ±2000 G, with white (black) patches indicating the positive (negative) polarities. (b) Proﬁle of Tw along the black line in (d), which
is parallel to the photopshere and passing the extremum point. The vertical-dashed lines correspond to the black dots in panel (d). The digits mark
the layers of the ﬂux rope. (c)-(d) Distributions of the logarithmic Q and Tw in the same plane indicated in Figure 4(b). The position of the plane
is also indicated by a white line in panel (a), with the white dot denoting the start point of the plane. The representative ﬁeld lines from each layer
are overplotted. The solid parts of the lines are in front of the plane (seen along the line of sight), while the dashed parts are behind the plane. The
colord dots mark the positions where the ﬁeld lines thread the plane. The black dots indicate locations where the horizontal black line intersects
with the high Q boundaries.

Fig. 6. Eruptive characteristics of the ﬂare. (a1)-(f1) Eruptive details observed by the AIA 131 Å passband. The white arrows in (f1) point out two
sets of post-ﬂare loops. The two dashed box in (f1) are the same as the ones in Figure 4(g), enclosing the northern and southern sets of loops. The
polarities P1
1, N1,P2 and N2 are marked in panels (a1) and (f1) for reference. (a2)-(f2) Eruption details captured by AIA 304 Å passband, showing
the eruption of the ﬁlament. The photospheric Bz is overplotted in panel (a2) for comparison, with white (green) contours for the positive (negative)
polarities. The contour levels are -600 G and 600 G. (a3)-(f3) Flare ribbons observed in the 1600 Å passband. The RHESSI HXR sources in the
12-25 keV energy bands are overplotted in panels (a1), (b1), (c1), (d2) and (e1), with contour levels at 60% and 90% of the peak ﬂux. The blue
rectangle in panel (a2) has the same FOV as the one in Figure 1(b). An associated animation lasting form 09:00 to 10:10 on 2012 July 4 is available
online, which incorporates the details of the precursor and the main ﬂare, and a C9.7-class ﬂare lasting from 09:00 to 09:09. Brightenings at the
BP region and ﬂare ribbons during the C9.7-class ﬂare are indicated by arrows in the movie. The BP region is also enclosed by a green rectangle
which is the same as the one in Figure 1(b). See relevant discussion in Section 4.

Fig. 8. Comparison between the eruptive characteristics and the magnetic topology. (a) Composite image of AIA 131 Å observations at three
diﬀerent times. The observation at 09:42 is shown in red, the one at 09:52 is shown in green, and the one at 10:02 is shown in blue, which display
the coronal null, the main phase of reconnection, and the post-ﬂare loops, respective. The three insets at the left are the negative images at the three
times. The white contours outline the ﬂare ribbons in the 1600 Å observation. The blue rectangle has the same FOV as the one in Figure 1(b).
The white-dashed line indicates the position of the slice used in panel (c). The white dot marks the start of the slice. (b) The ﬂux rope (shown in
iridescence) and the magnetic ﬁeld lines of the conﬁgurations associated with the null (shown in grey) in the extrapolated NLFFF. Panel (b) has
roughly the same FOV as panel (a). (c) The time-distance plot of the slice, showing the two phase of reconnection and the rise of the ﬁlament.
