ABSTRACT

Abundance anomalies in globular clusters provide strong evidence for multiple stellar populations
within each cluster. These populations are usually interpreted as distinct generations, with the
currently observed second-generation stars having formed in part from the ejecta of massive, ﬁrst-
generation “polluter” stars, giving rise to the anomalous abundance patterns. The precise nature of
the polluters and their enrichment mechanism are still unclear. Even so, the chemical abundances
measured in second-generation stars within the globular cluster NGC 2419 provide insight into this
puzzling process. Previous work used Monte Carlo nuclear reaction network calculations to constrain
the temperature-density conditions that could reproduce the observed abundances, thereby placing
robust limits on the origins of the polluter material. The eﬀect of individual reaction rates on these
conditions has not been studied, however. Thus, we perform an exhaustive sensitivity study on the
nuclear physics input to determine which reactions have the greatest impact on these predictions. We
ﬁnd that the 30Si(p,γ)31P, 37Ar(p,γ)38K, 38Ar(p,γ)39K, and 39K(p,γ)40Ca reactions are all critical in
determining the temperature-density conditions, and ultimately, the origin of the polluter material.
We conclude with recommendations for future experiments.

1. INTRODUCTION

clear.

Many aspects of globular cluster formation and evo-
lution are unknown. These stellar aggregates were once
thought to house only a single stellar population, how-
ever, recent photometric analysis suggests that they in-
stead harbor multiple, chemically distinct populations.
This is indicated by the presence of discrete tracks in a
color-magnitude diagram (Villanova et al. 2007; Piotto
et al. 2007) and signiﬁcant star-to-star variations in the
abundances of light elements (e.g., C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al).
These signatures cannot be attributed to a single stel-
lar generation formed from inhomogeneous interstellar
matter. Therefore, theories for globular cluster forma-
tion now assume multiple generations of stars, i.e., ﬁrst
and second generation (D’Ercole et al. 2008; Carretta
et al. 2010). The second generation is thought to form
from the highly processed ejecta of the ﬁrst-generation
“polluter” stars, giving rise to the abundance variations
observed today. The details of this self-enrichment sce-
nario, including the nature of the polluters, are still un-

NGC 2419 is a massive, metal-poor globular cluster in
the Milky Way outer halo which is now emblematic of
the self-enrichment phenomenon. Photometric analysis
of this cluster by Cohen et al. (2011), Cohen & Kirby
(2012), and Mucciarelli et al. (2012) revealed a popu-
lation of red giants with an unprecedented depletion in
magnesium ([Mg/Fe] ≈ −1)1. This depletion is coupled
to a strong enhancement in potassium ([K/Fe] ≈ 2),
giving rise to a Mg-K anticorrelation within NGC 2419.
The origin of this anticorrelation is not yet clear. Of par-
ticular interest are the evolutionary time-scales involved,
the identity of the polluter stars, and the enrichment
mechanism. Once understood, these characteristics may
shed new light on globular cluster and galaxy formation
as well as provide a means to distinguish between com-
peting models of self-enrichment.

With this potentially substantial impact on our un-

abundances of elements A and B observed in a star ((cid:63)) or the sun

derstanding of globular clusters, enrichment scenarios
for NGC 2419 have been studied extensively. First,
Ventura et al. (2012) explored the possibility that the
severe Mg depletion was caused by high temperature
burning within ﬁrst-generation asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) and super asymptotic giant branch (super AGB)
stars. In their model, the second generation formed di-
rectly from the ejecta of the ﬁrst-generation stars. They
found that the chemical abundances of the enriched ma-
terial could be made to agree with the observations pro-
vided both model parameters and thermonuclear reac-
tion rates were ﬁne-tuned. Later, Iliadis et al. (2016)
broadened the scope of this investigation. They used
Monte Carlo nuclear reaction network calculations to
constrain the physical conditions that could give rise to
the observed abundances. They found a correlation be-
tween stellar temperature and density values that pro-
vided a satisfactory match between simulated and ob-
served abundances. In comparing these conditions with
stellar models, they found that low-mass stars, AGB
stars, massive stars, and super-massive stars are un-
likely to account for the abundance anomalies. Super
AGB stars and classical novae, involving either carbon-
oxygen or oxygen-neon white dwarfs, could be the pol-
luters. However, the authors emphasized the need for
improved stellar models before drawing ﬁrm conclusions.
The thermonuclear reaction rates used to carry out
these studies are based on experimental measurements
and theoretical calculations. Some rates are only known
to within a factor of 10, owing to the uncertainty in
their nuclear physics input. Therefore, reaction rate
uncertainties must be considered for the most robust
predictions. Iliadis et al. (2016) already demonstrated
that these uncertainties aﬀect the range of plausible pol-
luter sites. They found that the allowed region of the
temperature-density parameter space widens consider-
ably when the impact of reaction rate uncertainties are
considered. In this work, we determine which reactions
contribute to this broadening, with the ultimate goal of
constraining the parameter space. In doing so, we aim
to reﬁne the list of polluter candidates.

In Section 2, we describe the nucleosynthesis model
used to study this anomalous globular cluster. We then
explore the eﬀect of varying the reaction rate uncertain-
ties and identify reactions critical to reproducing the
observed abundances in Section 3. In Section 4, we re-
view the nuclear physics input to reaction rate calcula-
tions. Recommendations for future experiments follow.
Finally, a summary is given in Section 5.

2. METHODS

In this work, we adopt the methodology of Iliadis et al.
(2016) to explore possible self-enrichment scenarios in
NGC 2419. For a thorough exposition, we refer the

reader to that work. Below, we review the salient fea-
tures of our model.

2.1. Polluter Model

The adopted model aims to reproduce the observed
abundances of NGC 2419 by simulating its formation
history. This comprises three major episodes. First,
the ﬁrst stars form following primordial nucleosynthe-
sis. These stars contribute metals to the proto-cluster
gas, bringing the overall metallicity to the currently ob-
served value of [Fe/H] = −2.09 ± .02 (Mucciarelli et al.
2012). The ﬁrst-generation globular cluster stars then
form from this material. Later, the most massive of
these stars will evolve quickly and explode as type II su-
pernovae. Others will evolve more slowly, giving rise to
the anomalous chemical enrichment. Sometime during
their evolution, these ﬁrst-generation stars eject part of
their matter into the intracluster gas. Finally, the cur-
rently observed second-generation stars form from this
polluted material, thereby inheriting the nucleosynthetic
signatures of both pre-enrichment material and the ﬁrst-
generation stars.

The situation described above is reproduced in our
simulations, albeit with simpliﬁcations. For instance,
for the composition of the proto-cluster gas, we adopted
the results of a one-zone chemical evolution model for
the Milky Way halo. This model is an updated ver-
sion of Goswami & Prantzos (2000), which reproduces,
with some minor adjustments, the reported abundances
of ﬁeld stars of the same average metallicity as NGC
2419 (see the Appendix of Iliadis et al. (2016) for de-
tails). Further, to keep our results as general as pos-
sible, we did not adopt any particular stellar evolution
model. Instead, we used a nuclear reaction network to
process stellar material in a single zone with constant
temperature and density.

The nuclear reaction network follows the evolution
of 213 nuclides, ranging from p, n, 4He, to 55Cr. We
adopted the thermonuclear reaction rates linking these
nuclides (2373 total) from STARLIB (Sallaska et al.
2013). This library provides the rate probability density
function at temperatures from 10 MK to 10 GK. This
unique feature will be discussed further in Section 2.2.
The simulated stellar evolution occurs as follows.
First, the proto-cluster, or “pristine” gas, is processed
at constant temperature, T , and density, ρ, using the
nuclear reaction network. The evolution is halted after
a variable amount of hydrogen, ∆X H ≡ X H
f , has
been consumed. This “processed” matter corresponds to
the composition of the ﬁrst-generation stars before they
eject material back into the cluster. For the second-
generation stars, we assume that the processed material
is diluted with f parts of pristine, intra-cluster gas, as

i − X H

given by:

Xmix =

Xproc + f Xpris
1 + f

(1)

where Xproc and Xpris denote the mass fractions of the
reaction network output (i.e., processed matter) and the
initial composition (i.e., pristine matter), respectively.
The elemental abundances of Xmix (i.e., Mg, K, Ca, Ti,
Si, Sc, and V) are then compared with those of the ob-
served, extreme population. For these stars, we adopt
the same abundance conditions as Iliadis et al. (2016),
which is based on the scatter in the data and abundance
uncertainties of individual stars. These are given by 1.3
< [K/Fe] < 2.0, -1.5 < [Mg/Fe] < -0.8, 0.1 < [Ca/Fe]
< 0.7, -0.2 < [Ti/Fe] < 0.7, 0.4 < [Si/Fe] < 1.1, 0.4 <
[Sc/Fe] < 1.3, and -0.2 < [V/Fe] < 0.6. If there is agree-
ment for any value of f , then the physical conditions
used in the simulation represent plausible conditions for
the nucleosynthesis of the polluter material.

Since this approach is so simple, we must exercise cau-
tion in interpreting the results. An important limitation
of our simulation is that hydrodynamical mechanisms
such as convection are absent. In a realistic scenario, the
burning region is continuously mixed with fresh (unpro-
cessed) material, replenishing the hydrogen available for
burning while diluting the byproducts. Compared with
the single-zone process adopted in this work, it would re-
quire a much longer burning period to achieve the same
abundance levels. For this reason, any constraints we
obtain on the amount of hydrogen consumed or equiva-
lently, the duration of burning, are not meaningful. In-
stead, we focus on the temperature and density, since
these parameters determine which nucleosynthesis path-
ways are operating, and ultimately, the elements synthe-
sized. By repeating this simulation many times, the ac-
cumulated temperature and density conditions provide
valuable constraints on the origin of this material.

2.2. Reaction Rate Uncertainties

In our simulations, the elemental abundances of the
polluter material depend on the interplay between thou-
sands of reactions. Iliadis et al. (2016) showed that when
reaction rate uncertainties were taken into account, the
range of physical conditions that could reproduce the
observed abundances broadened signiﬁcantly. This im-
plies that, for one or more reactions, the rate uncertainty
is large enough to have a substantive eﬀect on the out-
come of the simulation. Identifying these reactions will
lead to more robust theories for the origin of the pol-
luter material, as these important reactions can then be
carefully studied in nuclear physics laboratories.

We study the inﬂuence of both the statistical and sys-
tematic contributions to the reaction rate uncertainties.
The uncertainties adopted by STARLIB comprise the
statistical component and any known systematic eﬀects.

3

These vary widely from reaction to reaction, owing to
diﬀerences in the mechanism of the reaction (i.e., non-
resonant versus resonant reaction) as well as the avail-
ability of experimental data. For the majority of the
reactions relevant to this study, the rates have been de-
rived using the experimental Monte Carlo formalism de-
scribed in Longland et al. (2010). Using this method, the
uncertainty is determined by considering statistical and
known systematic uncertainties of the nuclear physics
input, e.g., resonance energies and strengths, partial
widths, and resonant S-factors, from physically moti-
vated probability densities. Experimental Monte Carlo
rates are available for only 64 reactions in the target
mass range from A = 14 to A = 40. For reaction rates
taken from other sources, such as the NACRE compi-
lation (Angulo et al. 1999), uncertainties are evaluated
on a case-by-case basis. Theoretical Hauser-Fechbach
rates are adopted from the TALYS computer program
(Koning et al. 2004) in the instances where there are no
reliable, experimentally determined reaction rates. For
these rates, STARLIB adopts a conservative factor un-
certainty of 10.

What is of main interest is not the magnitude of these
rate uncertainties but rather the knowledge of the full
probability distributions. Accordingly, for each reaction
STARLIB provides two temperature-dependent quanti-
ties, µ and σ, which describe the rate probability density
as a log-normal distribution,

f (x) =

1
√
2π

1
x

σ

(ln x

µ)2/(2σ2),

−

e−

(2)

where µ and σ determine the location and width of the
distribution. To sample the reaction rates, we follow
the procedure detailed in Iliadis et al. (2015). First, a
random number, pi, is generated from a Gaussian dis-
tribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of
unity. Sample i of reaction rate y is then given by

yi = ymed(f.u.)pi,

(3)

where ymed and f.u. are the median value and the factor
uncertainty. These quantities are given by eµ and eσ,
respectively (Longland 2012).

We must also consider the possibility that unknown
systematic errors exist. This would be the case, for ex-
ample, if there was an unknown resonance contributing
to the reaction. Additional possibilities include errors in
experimental procedure (e.g., target preparation, charge
collection) or poor choice of a nuclear model. These
eﬀects cannot easily be anticipated. Nevertheless, we
perform tests to explore the possibility that the tem-
perature and density predictions are sensitive to their
presence. To do so, we ﬁrst sample the rate according
to Eq. 3. We then apply a multiplicative variation fac-
tor, α, such that the new rate is given by α × yi. This

4

has the eﬀect of scaling the probability distribution of
this reaction rate by a factor α. In the next section, we
use both of these methods as a means to explore the rate
sensitivities in our nuclear reaction network calculations.

3. RESULTS

We begin by reproducing the results of Iliadis et al.
(2016), as they serve as a convenient baseline for com-
parison. We adopted their recommended initial compo-
sition and assumed ﬁxed thermonuclear rates (i.e., dis-
regarding any uncertainties). For each network simula-
tion, we varied the temperature, T , density, ρ, and ﬁnal
hydrogen abundance, X H
f , using a Monte Carlo routine.
We performed 1×105 of these network simulations, twice
the amount used in the earlier work, to ensure that the
parameter space was thoroughly sampled. At the con-
clusion of each one, the mixtures of the “pristine” and
“processed” matter were compared against the observed
abundances for mixing fractions of f = 1000 (i.e., al-
most purely pristine matter), 100, 30, 10, 3, 1.0, 0.1,
0.05, 0.02, and 0.0 (i.e., purely processed matter). For
conditions that gave a satisfactory ﬁt to the abundances,
the parameters are plotted as red dots in the top panel
of Figure 1. The width of this distribution indicates,
for a given density, the range of temperatures capable of
producing the abundances of all the relevant elements
in NGC 2419.

Next, we repeat this procedure while also varying the
reaction rates according to their rate probability dis-
tribution in STARLIB. Each reaction rate in the net-
work was sampled using Eq. 3. In the case of correlated
reactions, i.e., forward and reverse reaction pairs, the
rates were sampled together in order to preserve reci-
procity. The results are plotted as blue dots in Figure 1.
The degree of broadening due to the reaction rate un-
certainties is substantial, particularly at low densities.
To assess this eﬀect quantitatively, these simulations
were repeated with a ﬁxed density of ρ = 100 g/cm3.
Those that reproduced the measured abundances were
then binned according to their temperature. These are
shown in the bottom panel of Figure 1. Using this rep-
resentation, we deﬁne the degree of broadening as δ, the
diﬀerence in temperature between the 16th and 84th
percentiles of the distribution. At this density, the cu-
mulative eﬀect of varying all reaction rates results in
δvr(100 g/cm3) = 19.0 MK. When expressed as a fac-
tor increase over the results obtained with the recom-
mended rates (i.e., their median values), which gives
δmr(100 g/cm3) = 11.0 MK, we ﬁnd that δvr/δmr = 1.73.
This number indicates the increase in scatter of the tem-
perature values at ﬁxed density. To determine which of
the individual reaction rate uncertainties have the great-
est impact on the nucleosynthesis, we now consider the
broadening due to each reaction.

solutions onto the temperature axis. Note that the red histogram

poses.

ditions, δ/δmr, due to the uncertainty of each reaction in

37Ar(p, γ)38K, 38Ar(p, γ)39K, and 30Si(p, γ)31P lie to the far-right
of the centroid.

For each reaction in our network, we performed 2×104
simulations where we sampled only the corresponding
reaction rate. All other reaction rates remained ﬁxed
at their recommended values. The parameters T and
X H
f were varied as before, while ρ remained ﬁxed at
100 g/cm3. From the accepted samples, the tempera-
ture values were then used to measure the broadening
for each reaction.

Note that the number of simulations performed was
reduced to make this calculation more tractable. To en-

tion, this process was repeated for a select few reactions
using 1 × 105 simulations, a ﬁvefold increase. For each
of these reactions, the higher statistics results were in
agreement to within 3%, demonstrating that 2×104 net-
work simulations per reaction is suﬃcient. The distribu-
tion of all the measured δ/δmr values, the factor increase
over the result obtained using the recommended (me-
dian) rates, is shown in Figure 2. They appear normally
distributed with a mean of 0.99 and standard deviation
of 0.03. This suggests that the majority of the reaction
rates are known to suﬃcient accuracy with regard to the
nature of the polluter material, since their uncertainties
have a negligible contribution to the broadening. There
are three outliers, with values of δ/δmr = 1.12, 1.15 and
1.41, corresponding to the 37Ar(p, γ)38K, 38Ar(p, γ)39K,
and 30Si(p, γ)31P reactions, respectively. Their signiﬁ-
cant inﬂuence on the width of the temperature distri-
bution demonstrates that these reactions play a promi-
nent role in determining which stellar conditions, i.e.,
temperature and density, are capable of reproducing the
observed abundances.

Next, we explore whether the allowed T − ρ condi-
tions are sensitive to unknown systematic eﬀects, i.e.,
those not included in STARLIB. In addition to the three
reactions identiﬁed above, we also included in this test
those which are important to the synthesis and destruc-
tion of both magnesium and potassium. These include
the reactions comprising the Ne-Na and Mg-Al nucle-
osynthesis chains (Rolfs & Rodney 1988), as well as
the Ar-K chain (Iliadis et al. 2016) and the reaction,
39K(p, γ)40Ca. For each of these reactions, we performed
a series of 1×105 network simulations where their corre-
sponding rates were given an artiﬁcial systematic eﬀect.
The rates of these reactions were varied in two steps.
First, they were sampled within their STARLIB uncer-
tainty. Each rate sample was then multiplied by the
ﬁxed variation factor, α, representing the contribution
of some unknown eﬀect (see Section 2.2). The factors
considered here were 1/10, 1/5, 5, and 10. All other re-
actions were varied within their STARLIB uncertainties.

Figure 3 shows the sampled parameter space for each
simulation, where the rows correspond (from top to bot-
tom) to the 30Si(p, γ)31P, 37Ar(p, γ)38K, 38Ar(p, γ)39K,
and 39K(p, γ)40Ca reactions. For all of the other reac-
tions considered, the eﬀect of the variation was found to
be much less impactful. The variation factor α is dis-
played in the top right-hand corner of each plot. The
case with no artiﬁcial systematic eﬀect, i.e., α = 1, is
shown in the foreground (red dots) for comparison. The
eﬀect on the broadening of the temperature and den-
sity conditions (black dots) reveals their sensitivity to
the magnitude of each reaction rate. For instance, when

5

the 30Si(p, γ)31P reaction rate is increased by a factor
of 5, we ﬁnd that the T − ρ scatter becomes narrower,
with the high-temperature edge receding at any given
density. The simulated abundances at these conditions
(e.g., T = 170 MK, ρ = 100 g/cm3, X H
f = 0.50) are
found to be depleted in silicon when compared with the
α = 1 case, with a net reduction of ≈ 1.3 dex. This
indicates that the narrowing is caused by the onset of
silicon depletion via 30Si(p, γ)31P.

Adjustments to the 37Ar(p, γ)38K, 38Ar(p, γ)39K, and
39K(p, γ)40Ca reaction rates reveal a similar eﬀect on
the potassium abundance. Note that as both the
37Ar(p, γ)38K and 38Ar(p, γ)39K reaction rates are in-
creased, the T − ρ scatter increases, with newly viable
conditions appearing on the low-temperature side. For
the 38Ar(p, γ)39K reaction, the diﬀerence between the
leftmost and rightmost plot is particularly stark. Un-
der the same test conditions as before, the elemental
potassium abundance increases by ≈ 1.0 dex when this
reaction is varied from α = 1/10 to 10 times its recom-
mended value. The succeeding reaction, 39K(p, γ)40Ca,
has the opposite eﬀect of depleting potassium by ≈ 0.8
dex. This is made apparent by comparing the α = 1/10
and 10 cases, where it can be seen that the high-
temperature conditions no longer satisfy the abundance
constraints when the rate is increased.

These results demonstrate that systematic eﬀects in
these key reaction rates aﬀect the predicted temperature
and density conditions that forged the polluter material.
Finally, we explore the possibility that all four of these
reactions have unknown contributions and look at their
combined eﬀect on these conditions. We also consider
how this aﬀects which potential polluter sites (e.g., clas-
sical novae, AGB stars, super AGB stars) are thought to
reproduce the observed abundances. A complete discus-
sion of these candidates is given in Iliadis et al. (2016).
Their ﬁndings are summarized in Section 1.

We simulated two scenarios.

First, we assumed
that the 30Si(p, γ)31P, 37Ar(p, γ)38K, 38Ar(p, γ)39K, and
39K(p, γ)40Ca reaction rates each have variation factors
of α = 5, 1/5, 1/5, and 5, respectively. These factors
were chosen to correspond to the case of decreased pro-
duction of both silicon and potassium. We then repeated
this run, where instead we used factors of α = 1/5, 5,
5, and 1/5, respectively, representing the opposite sit-
uation. All reaction rates were also varied within their
STARLIB uncertainties. The results of these two sce-
narios are shown in Figure 4, superimposed on the pre-
dicted temperature-density evolutions for various stellar
models. For the variation factors used in the top panel
(corresponding to the silicon-poor, potassium-poor sce-
nario) we ﬁnd that the T −ρ scatter has been drastically
reduced. This is especially evident when compared with
the bottom panel, where the scatter is much broader,

the one-level Breit-Wigner formula can be substituted

all partial widths (e.g., Γp, Γα, Γγ) are known for a

that their cross section cannot be obtained experimen-

Instead, all that is measured is the resonance

perimental nuclear physics data, such as the resonance
location and strength, introduce a combined uncertainty
to the reaction rate. In the following, we explore the nu-
clear physics input that gives rise to the estimated total
uncertainty listed in STARLIB for these four reactions.

4.1. 37Ar(p, γ)38K and 38Ar(p, γ)39K

We found that the potassium enhancement was
sensitive to the proton capture rates for 37Ar and 38Ar.

mental information when available. Otherwise, various
local and global input parameters are used to represent
the nuclear structure properties, optical potentials, level
densities, γ-ray strengths, and ﬁssion properties. A com-
parison between experimental and TALYS cross sections
provided in Sallaska et al. (2013) suggests that the dis-
crepancies for low-mass nuclei (A < 50) could be as large
as a factor of 10. While an experimentally determined
rate would certainly be preferable, we recommend the
use of the TALYS rate until more reaction data is made
available.

R = 896.5 keV to Elab

Next, we will look at the available nuclear data for
the 38Ar(p, γ)39K reaction. The strengths and energies
of 99 resonances, ranging from the lowest, directly ob-
served resonance at Elab
R = 2400.6
keV, were measured by H¨anninen (1984). They also
calculated the ﬁrst experimentally derived thermonu-
clear rate for this reaction. This rate was intended for
use in modeling explosive oxygen burning, and conse-
quently it was only applicable to temperatures in the
range of T = 0.7 − 4.7 GK. Later, this rate was re-
evaluated for STARLIB by Sallaska et al. (2013) using
the Monte Carlo reaction rate formalism presented in
Longland et al. (2010). This was the ﬁrst experimental
rate calculation for the full range of stellar temperatures.
The STARLIB rate incorporates the eﬀect of several
resonances in the 100 − 500 keV range. The correspond-
ing compound levels have been identiﬁed using indirect
reactions and are listed in Table 1 along with their avail-
able measured properties. Experimental data on the
level properties for these states is limited. This is ev-
idenced by the ambiguous spin-parity assignments and
also the scarcity of partial width measurements. For
instance, the proton partial width, Γp, has only been
derived for the state at Ex = 6548 keV. The γ-ray par-
tial width has been determined for several other states
via lifetime measurements (Nolan et al. 1981; Moreh
et al. 1988). However, without the complementary pro-
ton partial width, the precise contribution of these levels
to the reaction rate is unknown.

The details of the reaction rate calculation based on
these data are available in Sallaska et al. (2013), and
we refer the reader to that work. We brieﬂy point out
that the experimental Monte Carlo reaction rate for-
malism takes uncertainties in the nuclear physics input
into account by sampling the parameters from appro-
priate probability density functions. This unique fea-
ture is demonstrated for the 38Ar(p, γ)39K reaction in
the top panel of Figure 5. The fractional contribution of
each resonance to the thermonuclear reaction rate is pre-
sented, where the width of the bands corresponds to the
Monte Carlo uncertainty of each contribution. Between
100 and 300 MK, we ﬁnd that the rate is dominated by
contributions from the Ecm
R = 147, 305, and 447 keV

Figure 4. Temperature and density combinations that provide
an acceptable match between simulated and observed abundances
are shown as black dots superimposed over temperature-density
tracks for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon classical novae (“CN”)
(Iliadis et al. 2016), AGB (Karakas 2010), and super AGB (Do-
herty et al. 2014) models. (Top) The 30Si(p, γ)31P, 37Ar(p, γ)38K,
38Ar(p, γ)39K, and 39K(p, γ)40Ca reactions rates have been mul-
tiplied by 5, 1/5, 1/5, and 5, respectively. (Bottom) The variation
factors are 1/5, 5, 5, and 1/5 respectively.

These reactions, along with several others, comprise a
nucleosynthesis chain for potassium production. This
chain begins with proton capture on 36Ar and proceeds
to the stable isotope 39K via the reaction sequence
36Ar(p, γ)37K(β+ν)37Ar(p, γ)38K(β+ν)38Ar(p, γ)39K.
We are particularly interested in these two reaction
rates at the temperatures investigated in Section 3,
where this reaction sequence is the predominant pro-
ducer of potassium. These temperatures range from
120 to 240 MK, with the corresponding center-of-mass
energies of the interacting nuclei ranging from 100 to
500 keV.

First, we will consider the 37Ar(p, γ)38K reaction. The
target nuclide, 37Ar, is a short-lived cosmogenic isotope,
with a half-life of t1/2 = 35.001(19) days (Cameron et al.
2012). A measurement of this reaction via either pro-
ton (a direct measurement) or 3He bombardment (an
indirect measurement) is prohibitively diﬃcult. An at-
tractive alternative is to measure the kinematic inverse,
1H(37Ar,γ)38K, using radioactive ion beam methods,
however, no such experiment has been attempted yet.
Since there is scant empirical data on the resonances
in this reaction, STARLIB adopts theoretical estimates
based on the nuclear reaction model code, TALYS (Kon-
ing et al. 2004; Goriely et al. 2008), for the reaction rate.
TALYS calculates nuclear cross sections using experi-

resonances. All three exhibit a large degree of uncer-
tainty owing to the lack of experimental data for their
proton partial widths (Table 1). Therefore, new mea-
surements would signiﬁcantly reduce the uncertainties
of the 38Ar(p, γ)39K reaction rate.

4.2. 39K(p, γ)38Ca

The potassium synthesized by the Ar-K nucleosyn-
thesis chain is susceptible to destruction through the
39K(p, γ)40Ca reaction.
In Section 3, we found that
varying the thermonuclear rate for this reaction pro-
duced a marked change in the range of the plausible
temperature and density conditions of the polluter ma-
terial. This eﬀect warrants a closer look at the nuclear
physics input to the reaction rate.

R = 622.2 keV (Kikstra et al. 1990).

The rate adopted in this work is based on the recent
evaluation presented in Longland (2017), which uses the
Monte Carlo reaction rate formalism of Longland et al.
(2010). For a comprehensive overview of this reaction
and the available nuclear data, we refer the reader to
this work and the references therein. We note here
that the lowest-lying, directly observed resonance is at
Elab
Information
on the compound levels between 100 and 500 keV is
therefore limited to indirect measurements. Of the 15
resonances observed in this range, the proton partial
width, Γp, has been estimated only for the Ecm
R = 97,
223, and 337 keV resonances (Seth et al. 1967; Cage
et al. 1971; Fuchs et al. 1969). Their estimated rela-
tive contributions to the reaction rate are illustrated in
the middle panel of Figure 5 alongside other important
resonances. The key feature of this plot is that the 337-
keV resonance (solid green band) is the main contributer
to the 39K+p reaction at temperatures in the range of

Figure 5.
Individual contributions from resonances and non-
resonant amplitudes to the total reaction rate at given temper-
atures for the reactions 38Ar(p, γ)39K (top), 39K(p, γ)40Ca (mid-
dle), and 30Si(p, γ)31P (bottom). Contributions were calculated
using the STARLIB reaction rates. The vertical width of each
band indicates the Monte Carlo uncertainty of the contribution at
a ﬁxed temperature and corresponds to a coverage probability of
68%. Numbers at the top denote center-of-mass energies of given
resonances. ‘A-Rate 1’ refers to the non-resonant (direct capture)
rate contribution. The dotted line at higher temperatures indi-
cates the aggregate contribution of higher lying resonances.

140 − 400 MK. Since most of the allowed temperature-
density conditions fall within this range (see Figure 1),
the ﬁnal elemental potassium abundance in our simula-

tion rate within its probability distribution function, as
listed in STARLIB, we found that the 37Ar(p, γ)38K,
38Ar(p, γ)39K, and 30Si(p, γ)31P reactions are important
in determining a more conﬁned range of these condi-
tions.

We then applied artiﬁcial systematic eﬀects to the
rates to explore the possibility that the acceptable tem-
perature and density conditions were sensitive to un-
known errors in the nuclear physics input. We adjusted
the rates from 1/10 to 10 times their recommended value
and found this resulted in a substantive change in the
acceptable solutions, with each rate changing the range
of stellar temperatures required to produce the observed
abundances. In addition to the three reactions already
identiﬁed, we also found that the 39K(p, γ)40Ca reac-
tion produced a marked change in these conditions. To
further test the inﬂuence that systematic eﬀects could
have, we then simulated two scenarios in which all four
of these reactions rates were given artiﬁcial systematic
eﬀects. In the ﬁrst scenario, we adjusted each rate by
a factor of either 5 or 1/5 to promote silicon synthesis
and deter potassium production. In the second scenario,
we did the opposite. In comparing these two simulations
we found that these minor rate adjustments changed the
outcome of our simulations dramatically, leading either
to signiﬁcantly improved (ﬁrst scenario) or worse (sec-
ond scenario) constraints on the temperature and den-
sity conditions. This suggests that new reaction rate
measurements should lead to more robust predictions.

Finally, we discussed the available nuclear structure
data for the 30Si(p, γ)31P, 37Ar(p, γ)38K, 38Ar(p, γ)39K,
and 39K(p, γ)30Ca reactions. Resonances important to
the reaction rates at temperatures of 120−240 MK have
not been measured directly to date. Thus, we recom-
mend their study as a means to reﬁne the list of plausible
polluter candidate sites in the cluster NGC 2419.

tions is largely determined by the width of this single
resonance. Therefore, in addition to the resonances sug-
gested for 38Ar(p, γ)39K reaction, we also recommend a
direct measurement of the Ecm
R = 337 keV resonance in
39K(p, γ)40Ca to further our understanding of the ob-
served potassium enrichment in NGC 2419.

4.3. 30Si(p, γ)31P

Silicon synthesis and destruction varies precipitously
in the 100 − 200 MK temperature range. At the lower-
end (< 140 MK), silicon is primarily made up of the
isotope 28Si. In this regime, destruction via proton cap-
ture is suﬃciently slow, allowing the elemental abun-
dance of silicon to increase steadily by way of the
27Al(p, γ)28Si reaction. At higher temperatures, 28Si
is more eﬃciently converted to 30Si via the sequence
28Si(p, γ)29P(β+ν)29Si(p, γ)30P(β+ν)30Si. At temper-
atures above about 160 MK, the accumulated 30Si is
rapidly consumed via the 30Si(p, γ)31P reaction, reduc-
ing the silicon abundance to sub-solar values. By vary-
ing this rate in Section 3, we found that the onset of this
depletion aﬀects the simulated temperature and density
conditions of the polluter material. For this reason, a
more precise estimation of the 30Si(p, γ)31P reaction rate
is necessary.

The most recent experimental rate was published in
Longland et al. (2010) using the Monte Carlo reac-
tion rate formalism. For stellar temperatures between
T = 120 − 240 MK, the rate is determined by ﬁve res-
onances in the Ecm
R = 100 − 500 keV range. Only two
of these have been measured previously. The strength
of the Ecm
R = 482.7 keV resonance was measured di-
rectly by Kuperus et al. (1959). To date, this is the
lowest-lying, directly observed resonance in this reac-
tion. For the Ecm
R = 439.1 keV resonance, the pro-
ton partial width, Γp, was determined indirectly via
the 30Si(3He, d)31P reaction (Vernotte et al. 1990). The
other three resonances, Ecm
R = 144.3, 169.1, and 418.1
keV, have not yet been measured. Their fractional con-
tributions to the total rate are illustrated in the bot-
tom panel of Figure 5. The Ecm
R = 418.1 keV state is
shown to have the largest contribution (50-100%). A
direct measurement of this resonance would therefore
allow for a more precise determination of the reaction
rate at these temperatures.

5. SUMMARY

We reported here on a sensitivity study of the phys-
ical conditions that reproduce the abundance anoma-
lies measured in NGC 2419. Using the methodology
ﬁrst presented in Iliadis et al. (2016), we obtained tem-
perature and density combinations that simultaneously
satisfy the observed abundances of Mg, Si, K, Ca,
Sc, Ti, and V. By varying each thermonuclear reac-
