ABSTRACT

We present X-ray imaging spectroscopy of one of the weakest active region (AR) microﬂares ever
studied. The microﬂare occurred at ∼11:04 UT on 2018 September 9 and we studied it using the
Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) and the Solar Dynamic Observatory’s Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). The microﬂare is observed clearly in 2.5–7 keV with NuSTAR and in
Fe XVIII emission derived from the hotter component of the 94 ˚A SDO/AIA channel. We estimate
the event to be three orders of magnitude lower than a GOES A class microﬂare with an energy of
1.1×1026 erg. It reaches temperatures of 6.7 MK with an emission measure of 8.0×1043 cm−3. Non-
thermal emission is not detected but we instead determine upper limits to such emission. We present
the lowest thermal energy estimate for an AR microﬂare in literature, which is at the lower limits of
what is still considered an X-ray microﬂare.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares occur in active regions (ARs) and rapidly release stored magnetic energy into heating, mass ﬂows, and
particle acceleration in its vicinity (Benz 2017). The energy released can vary greatly, with smaller solar ﬂares (called
microﬂares) having energies about 1028–1026 erg (Lin et al. 1984; Hannah et al. 2011). Microﬂares have been extensively
studied in X-rays, to determine their thermal and non-thermal properties and are observed to have GOES soft X-ray
ﬂuxes <10−6 W m−2 and so are B, A, or sub-A class ﬂares. Even smaller events (called nanoﬂares) were proposed
by Parker (1988) as a unit of impulsive energy release to heat the whole corona, not just in ARs. These incredibly
small events, with energies about 1024 erg, would need to be highly frequent with their frequency distribution having
a power-law index >2 to dominate energetically over the larger ﬂares (Crosby et al. 1993; Hudson 1991). The term
nanoﬂare is sometimes used to describe an observed extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) brightening with energies about this
scale.

X-ray emission from microﬂares has been extensively studied in the past with instruments such as the Reuven
Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI, Lin et al. (2002)). A comprehensive study of more than
25,000 microﬂaring events observed by RHESSI found that they shared many properties with their larger counterparts
(Christe et al. 2008; Hannah et al. 2008). It was also noted that physical ﬂare size did not seem to correlate with the
magnitude of the microﬂare. To extend this work to even smaller ﬂares requires improved sensitivity.

The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) is an X-ray astrophysical telescope with the capability of
observing the Sun above 2.5 keV with unprecedented sensitivity (Harrison et al. 2013). NuSTAR consists of Wolter-I
type optics on a 10 m mast that focus X-rays onto two focal plane modules (FPMA and FPMB), each with a ﬁeld
of view of 12(cid:48)×12(cid:48), made up of four pixelated CdZnTe detectors separated by chip gaps. NuSTAR detects individual
counts, with a throughput of 400 counts s−1 module−1. Even quiet or weakly ﬂaring emission from the Sun can
produce high count rates, resulting in signiﬁcant deadtime and low eﬀective exposure, thus most solar observations
operate with a livetime fraction (cid:28)1 (Grefenstette et al. 2016). This can limit NuSTAR’s sensitivity to the hottest
material or weaker non-thermal energy during periods when livetime is small.

Since the ﬁrst solar NuSTAR observations in 2014 (see Grefenstette et al. 2016; Hannah et al. 2016; Kuhar et al.
2017), solar activity has decreased allowing sub-A class microﬂares to be observed regularly within ARs (Glesener
et al. 2017, 2020; Wright et al. 2017; Hannah et al. 2019) and small brightenings outside of ARs (Kuhar et al. 2018)1.
The AR microﬂares observed by NuSTAR have been found to have thermal energy releases down to 1027 erg with
quiet Sun brightenings having energies down to 1026 erg. Non-thermal emission has rarely been observable in NuSTAR
microﬂare analyses, with Glesener et al. (2020) reporting the ﬁrst focusing optics imaging spectroscopy of non-thermal
emission from an A5.7 class microﬂare. Limits on the non-thermal emission have been determined in other NuSTAR
microﬂare analyses (Wright et al. 2017).

In this Letter, we present observations of a microﬂare from 2018 September 9 at ∼11:04 UT (SOL2018-09-09T11)
in AR AR12721. This event was observed with NuSTAR and also in EUV with the Solar Dynamic Observatory’s
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA; Lemen et al. 2012). In Section 2 the whole NuSTAR campaign, across
2018 September 9–10, is brieﬂy discussed. We then focus on the small microﬂare’s time proﬁles and spatial properties
(Section 2.1) followed by X-ray spectral analysis and GOES ﬂare classiﬁcation (Section 2.2). A thermal energy estimate
is then calculated and compared to previously obtained values for other microﬂares in Section 2.3. An upper limit on
the non-thermal emission of the microﬂare is also derived in Section 2.4. In Section 2.5, NuSTAR and SDO/AIA loci
curves and emission measure distributions are calculated along with a comparison of the emission detected from both
observatories.

2. WEAKEST AR X-RAY MICROFLARE

NuSTAR performed six hour-long solar observations on 2018 September 9–10 with AR12721 (that emerged Septem-
ber 8) dominating the ﬁeld of view.. This campaign was related to a region targeted by the FOXSI-3 sounding rocket
(Musset et al. 2019) on September 7, which was still in the NuSTAR ﬁeld of view, but fainter and less active than
AR12721. Numerous X-ray microﬂares produced by AR12721 were seen over the two-day observing window. In this
Letter we focus on one of the smaller events; the other microﬂares are the subjects of a later paper.

2.1. Time Proﬁle and Imaging

The microﬂare presented was initially discovered upon inspection of the NuSTAR lightcurve, shown in Figure 1,
panel (a), calculated from the region shown in panel (b). The emission from the microﬂare becomes more pronounced
above the background in the higher energy range of 4–7 keV compared to 2.5–4 keV. A corresponding “bump” can
be seen clearly in the SDO/AIA Fe XVIII proxy (Del Zanna 2013) but SDO/AIA 94 ˚A, nor the other SDO/AIA
channels, displayed a clear feature. The 94 ˚A images show a loop better than any other original SDO/AIA channel,
but it is only in the Fe XVIII component that there is clear evidence of the microﬂare heating (Figure 1, panels (d)
and (e)). Due to the position of the event on the NuSTAR focal plane, only the data obtained from FPMB can be
used as the detector chip gap aﬀects the FPMA data. It does, however, provide corroboratory evidence for the event
as it also shows a clear microﬂare time proﬁle.

It should be noted that, as expected of ﬂaring behavior, it appears that the emission seen from the higher NuSTAR
energy range, 4–7 keV, rises slightly before emission peaks in lower energies from NuSTAR 2.5–4 keV and Fe XVIII.
This could be due to hotter plasma earlier in the event or an initially accelerated electron distribution, a potential
indication of non-thermal emission.

The NuSTAR pointing only requires a single correction over the entire time of the ﬂare, found by aligning the
NuSTAR image to SDO/AIA. We co-align the NuSTAR images with the Fe XVIII microﬂare emission map shown in
panel (e). The shift in the NuSTAR pointing was obtained by cross-correlating the X-ray and EUV images. Even after

(green, blue) are indicated in their panels, (d) and (e), with a white and black box, respectively. The vertical dotted lines in

and NuSTAR images were integrated over the microﬂaring time. A Gaussian ﬁlter with a FWHM of ∼15 arcseconds was used
to smooth the NuSTAR X-ray images that have been livetime corrected.

the spatial co-alignment, there still remains a conservative shift uncertainty of approximately 10 arcseconds. This is
due to the lack of deﬁned structure in the X-ray image.

Contour maps of the shifted NuSTAR data on an Fe XVIII background during the pre-ﬂare and microﬂare times
are presented in Figure 2. The energy ranges are the same as those used in the lightcurves from Figure 1. Contours
created from 2.5–4 keV (purple) and 4–7 keV (red) emission were deconvolved using a Lucy-Richardson method over
20 and 10 iterations, respectively (Richardson 1972). There is some 2.5–4 keV emission during the pre-ﬂare time,
which becomes brighter during the microﬂare and joined by the 4–7 keV source at the same location.

To see the heating due to the microﬂare we subtract the pre-ﬂare image from the microﬂare one - the resulting
microﬂare excess is shown in Figure 2 (bottom panel). Here an elongated loop is more clearly visible in Fe XVIII
and the 2.5–4 keV source is similar to before. However, now the 4–7 keV source is more elongated and the centroid
is slightly shifted to the left of the 2.5–4 keV source. This may not be a signiﬁcant shift as it is within the spatial
resolution of NuSTAR (Grefenstette et al. 2016). Although the time proﬁle (Figure 1) and later the spectral ﬁt results
(Figure 3) show a deﬁnite but small event, the physical size of the microﬂaring loop (∼20 arcseconds in length) is not
uncommon from others observed in X-rays (Glesener et al. 2017; Hannah et al. 2008).

excess.

2.2. NuSTAR Spectral Fitting

In order to quantify thermal emission of the AR and microﬂare we ﬁt the NuSTAR FPMB spectra (Figure 3). A cir-
cular region, centered on the brightest emission over the pre-ﬂare and microﬂare times, with a radius of 26.5 arcseconds,
was used to produce both spectra.

The pre-ﬂare spectrum (emission from 11:00:30 to 11:03:30 UT, Figure 3, left) is well ﬁtted with a single APEC
thermal model using XSPEC (Arnaud 1996). The ﬁt gives a temperature of 3.2 MK and an emission measure of
1.7×1046 cm−3. These are typical values of quiescent/non-ﬂaring ARs measured by NuSTAR (Wright et al. 2017;
Glesener et al. 2017; Hannah et al. 2019). However, the livetime recorded throughout this event is signiﬁcantly larger
than those previously studied (∼15% compared to 1–5%) resulting in a better sensitivity, and hence constraint, on
hotter material. This spectral ﬁt was used as a ﬁxed component during the microﬂare time (11:03:30 to 11:05:10 UT,
Figure 3, right panel) with an additional APEC thermal component used to ﬁt the microﬂare excess.

The microﬂare excess has a harder spectrum that dominates over the pre-ﬂare emission >4 keV, similar to what
was found in Section 2.1. The event excess was ﬁtted with a temperature of 6.7 MK and an emission measure of
8.0×1043 cm−3. The temperature is similar, or slightly hotter, to those found from other weak microﬂaring events,
whereas the emission measure is an order of magnitude smaller (Glesener et al. 2017; Hannah et al. 2019).

Figure 3. Thermal model ﬁts, using XSPEC, of NuSTAR emission during the pre-ﬂare time (left panel) and microﬂare time
(right panel). The pre-ﬂare spectrum is ﬁtted with one thermal model (blue), which is then used as a ﬁxed component for
the microﬂare spectrum ﬁt along with an additional thermal model (red). Both models in the microﬂare spectrum combine to
give the overall model (purple). The temperatures, emission measures, and times ranges are shown for the spectra with their
eﬀective exposures and livetimes in brackets. The quoted errors denote a 90% conﬁdence range with the ﬁt over the energy
range indicate by the vertical dashed lines.

The excess thermal ﬁt does not change considerably when taking into account the uncertainty in the pre-ﬂare
model. It should be noted that because temperature and emission measure are inversely correlated, the highest/lowest
temperature corresponds to the lowest/highest emission measure with asymmetric errors on each. We ﬁnd that the
temperature derived for the microﬂare excess through spectral ﬁtting is consistent with the presence of emission in the
SDO/AIA Fe XVIII channel.

Using the goes_flux49.pro2 IDL routine in conjunction with the temperature and emission measure of the microﬂare
excess, it is possible to obtain an estimated GOES classiﬁcation for the event. We ﬁnd a ﬂux of 5×10−11 W m−2, an
equivalent GOES class of ∼A0.005.

2.3. Thermal Energy

From the temperature (T ) and emission measure (EM ) of the microﬂare excess, with the addition of a volume

estimate (V ) for the heated loop, the instantaneous thermal energy (Eth) can be calculated as

Eth = 3NekBT = 3(V × EM )

2 kBT

[erg],

(1)

where Ne is the total number of thermal electrons and kB is Boltzmann’s constant (Hannah et al. 2008). The
temperature and emission measure are taken from the microﬂare excess, given in Figure 3 (right panel). The volume
of the loop can be estimated from the EUV SDO/AIA Fe XVIII image (Figure 2, bottom panel).

The microﬂaring loop appears to be 22 by 2 arcseconds (approximately 1.6×109 by 1.3×108 cm). Taking the heated
loop as a half-torus, this gives a volume of 3.2×1025 cm3. Thus, using Equation 1 with a temperature of 6.7 MK
and emission measure 8.0×1043 cm−3, we ﬁnd a thermal energy of 1.4+0.3
−0.2×1026 erg. The volume estimated here is
undoubtedly an upper limit as it could be contested that the region in EUV is smaller still as most of the emission

appears to be focused at the right of the loop with surrounding fainter emission. In addition, this volume estimate
does not consider a loop-ﬁlling factor, making the thermal energy estimate an upper limit. This thermal energy value
is lower than the previous smallest observed NuSTAR microﬂare (Hannah et al. 2019), which was cooler but with a
higher emission measure and had a GOES class of A0.02. EUV observations of magnetically braided loops observed
heating with thermal energy of about 1026 erg (Cirtain et al. 2013); however, this was for material up to 4 MK.

2.4. Non-thermal Limits

Following the approach in Wright et al. (2017), it is possible to obtain upper limits on any non-thermal emis-
sion produced by the microﬂare from NuSTAR’s spectral response. This is done by adding a thick target model
(f_thick2.pro3) to a simulated spectrum obtained from the total microﬂare thermal model. This non-thermal model
depends on the power-law index, the low-energy cut-oﬀ, and the electron ﬂux of the microﬂare accelerated electrons.
The non-thermal power was calculated throughout this parameter space, where the thick target model gave fewer
than four counts at energies greater than 7 keV—consistent with a null detection to 2σ (Gehrels 1986)—and that
the introduced non-thermal counts were within Poissonian uncertainty at energies (cid:54)7 keV. We ﬁnd that the upper
non-thermal limits produced are consistent with the required heating over the microﬂare time (∼1024 erg s−1) but
only with low-energy cut-oﬀs down to ∼6 keV with a power-law index (cid:62)6.

The upper limit values calculated that satisfy this microﬂare heating are lower than the upper limits in Wright et al.
(2017). This is expected as the microﬂare discussed here is less energetic. The largest upper limit obtained from
this analysis (∼1025 erg s−1) is only just comparable to the smallest non-thermal power in similar sized microﬂares
(Hannah et al. 2008, Table 1). The power-law index and cut-oﬀ energy are consistent with the values obtained in
Glesener et al. (2020). Only the electron ﬂux is diﬀerent (∼103 larger) which could be expected as the peak emission
is also orders of magnitude larger than the ﬂare discussed here. However, the values obtained are not consistent with
the events presented in Testa et al. (2014) who investigated coronal loop footpoint brightenings in iltraviolet (UV) and
a nanoﬂare heating model. Their model required that an electron distribution with a higher low-energy cut-oﬀ (∼10
keV) to match their observations compared to the microﬂare presented.

2.5. Multi-thermal Microﬂare Analysis

Figure 4 shows the EM loci curves (ﬂux divided by temperature response) from SDO/AIA and NuSTAR plotted with
the temperatures and emission measures obtained from Figure 3 and their 90% conﬁdence region (hatched regions).
During the pre-ﬂare time (Figure 4, left), the Fe XVIII and NuSTAR loci curves almost intersect at the temperature
and emission measure from the spectral ﬁt. This indicates that similar emission is observed by NuSTAR and Fe XVIII
at the pre-ﬂare stage over the selected region (Hannah et al. 2019). The microﬂare time has the additional heated
plasma from the ﬂaring process (see Figure 3 and Figure 4, right) which as expected, results in Fe XVIII and NuSTAR
not intersecting at the same point, nor agreeing with the spectral ﬁt value.

To determine the multi-thermal properties we calculate the emission measure distribution (EMD; the line-of-sight
diﬀerential emission measure multiplied by the temperature bin width, in units of cm−5) using the regularized inversion
approach of Hannah & Kontar (2013). Both AIA and NuSTAR data were used and the resulting EMD curves, and
uncertainty regions, are shown in Figure 4.

We ﬁnd that, in Figure 4, the calculated EMDs are consistent with the values obtained from the spectral ﬁts and
the loci curve upper boundaries. The EMD indicates a sharp edge at the quiescent AR/pre-ﬂare spectral ﬁtting values
(Figure 4, left panel) and a smoother drop in hotter material during the microﬂaring time (right panel). As the
microﬂare heats the plasma an excess of material appears at temperatures where the “tail” of the pre-ﬂare plasma
falls oﬀ quickly. This behavior is similar to what has been found for signiﬁcantly larger microﬂares, also observed in
EUV and X-rays (Athiray et al. 2020). The pre-ﬂare time EMD in Figure 4 (left panel) again shows the importance of
higher-energy X-ray spectroscopy when trying to robustly determine the presence of hot material in non-ﬂaring ARs,
as highlighted in previous studies (Reale et al. 2009; Schmelz et al. 2009; Ishikawa et al. 2017).

By subtracting the pre-ﬂare emission from the microﬂare—isolating the microﬂare heated plasma—the loci curves
show more consistent behavior with the spectral ﬁt excess parameters (6.7 MK and 8.0×1043 cm−3), again, indicating
similar emission seen by both observatories (Figure 5, left panel).

time (left panel) and microﬂare time (right panel). The shaded areas denote the uncertainty range for the NuSTAR loci curves
(purple and red), the Fe XVIII curve (dashed, blue), and the emission measure distribution (gray). The region used to calculate
the SDO/AIA and NuSTAR instrument loci curves was the boxed region shown in Figure 1, panels (d) and (e). The spectral
ﬁt values for both times are indicated with their hatched 90% conﬁdence regions.

Figure 5. Microﬂare excess NuSTAR (purple, red) and SDO/AIA Fe XVIII (blue) EM loci curves in comparison to the
microﬂare excess EMD (gray). SDO/AIA Fe XVIII loci were obtained for two diﬀerent source regions: “Box” and “Small Loop”
indicated in the right panel. The spectral ﬁt value for the microﬂare excess is shown in the loci plot with a black dot and 90%
conﬁdence region where errors on all other quantities are omitted due to their large magnitude.

Figure 5 (left panel) displays further evidence that the microﬂare emission is from the right-hand side of the region
assumed in Section 2.1. The Fe XVIII (blue, solid) loci curve from the “Small Loop” area is far more consistent with
the NuSTAR loci curves and spectral ﬁt value compared to the larger “Box” region loci curve (blue, dashed-dotted).
This indicates that during the microﬂare time the excess emission is observed from this “Small Loop” region and that
the pre-ﬂare emission was from a larger fraction of the AR.

Further support for this is seen when we compare the observed SDO/AIA Fe XVIII ﬂux from these regions to
the synthetic AIA ﬂux, calculated from the NuSTAR thermal parameters folded through the AIA response. Using
the AIA ﬂux from the “Box” we ﬁnd that NuSTAR appears to detect ∼62% of the emission observed by SDO/AIA

is more consistent for the microﬂare excess with the temperature calculated and the Fe XVIII response. Thus, it is
determined that the “Small Loop” region shown in Figure 5 is the true microﬂaring loop. A volume of 1.9×1025 cm3
and energy of 1.1+0.2
−0.2×1026 erg is then recalculated for this smaller loop, lowering the already small upper limit given
to the instantaneous energy release of this microﬂare.

3. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Using NuSTAR, in conjunction with SDO/AIA, we have identiﬁed the smallest thermal energy X-ray microﬂare yet
detected within an AR. A typical quiescent AR/pre-ﬂare temperature and emission measure (∼3 MK and ∼1046 cm−3
respectively) was obtained when ﬁtting a thermal model to the spectrum with the microﬂare excess reaching temper-
atures up to 6.7 MK and an emission measure of 8.0×1043 cm−3. This is hotter and has a lower emission measure
than most of the previously studied NuSTAR microﬂares (Hannah et al. 2016, 2019; Glesener et al. 2017; Wright et al.
2017).

The microﬂare is estimated to have a thermal energy release of 1.1+0.2

−0.2×1026 erg. This is the not the most spatially
compact microﬂare, but it is the smallest thermal energy release from an X-ray microﬂare observed in an AR. This
thermal energy is comparable to the small brightenings seen in high-resolution EUV observations of magnetically
braided loops (Cirtain et al. 2013). This shows that with NuSTAR we are starting to detect the X-ray emission from
the myriad of small brightenings seen in EUV, and are approaching events closer to nanoﬂare than microﬂare energies.
No non-thermal emission was detected; however, some electron acceleration could have occurred throughout the
evolution of the microﬂare. Support for this comes in the form of the higher energy time proﬁle (NuSTAR 4–7 keV)
rising earlier than the lower energy proﬁles (NuSTAR 2.5–4 keV and SDO/AIA Fe XVIII). We found non-thermal
upper limits that were consistent with not producing detectable emission, yet still capable of matching the heating
rate in this microﬂare.

This tiny microﬂare was very evident in the X-ray data but harder to ﬁnd in the EUV emission, highlighting the
need for sensitive X-ray telescopes to study ﬂares. It may be easier, however, to ﬁnd more events of this scale within
ARs, using this one as an example. This would further the investigation into how the ﬂare frequency distribution of
smaller ﬂares compare to that of larger ones (Crosby et al. 1993; Hudson 1991; Hannah et al. 2011).

Throughout the six ∼1 hour NuSTAR observations on 2018 September 9–10 there was a multitude of microﬂares
from AR12721. The statistics of these events will be the subject of another paper, furthering our understanding of the
range of small ﬂares possible.

This Letter made use of data from the NuSTAR mission, a project led by the California Institute of Technology,
managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. These
observations were supported through the NuSTAR Guest Observer program (NASA grant 80NSSC18K1744). This
research has made use of SunPy v1.0.6, an open-source and free community-developed solar data analysis Python
package (SunPy Community et al. 2015). This research also made use of HEASoft (a uniﬁed release of FTOOLS
and XANADU software packages) and NuSTAR Data Analysis Software (NuSTARDAS). This Letter made use of the
SolarSoft IDL distribution (SSW) from the IDL Astronomy Library.
