THE STRUCTURE OF TAME MINIMAL DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS
FOR GENERAL GROUPS

ELI GLASNER

Abstract. We use the structure theory of minimal dynamical systems to show
that, for a general group Γ, a tame, metric, minimal dynamical system (X, Γ) has
the following structure:

˜X

η

(cid:127)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)

X

π

θ∗

X ∗

ι

Z

σ

π∗

Y

Y ∗

θ
Here (i) ˜X is a metric minimal and tame system (ii) η is a strongly proximal
extension, (iii) Y is a strongly proximal system, (iv) π is a point distal and RIM
extension with unique section, (v) θ, θ∗ and ι are almost one-to-one extensions, and
(vi) σ is an isometric extension.

When the map π is also open this diagram reduces to

X

˜X

η

(cid:127)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)(cid:126)

π

ι

Z

σ

Y

In general the presence of the strongly proximal extension η is unavoidable. If
the system (X, Γ) admits an invariant measure µ then Y is trivial and X = ˜X is an
almost automorphic system; i.e. X ι→ Z, where ι is an almost one-to-one extension
and Z is equicontinuous. Moreover, µ is unique and ι is a measure theoretical
isomorphism ι : (X, µ, Γ) → (Z, λ, Γ), with λ the Haar measure on Z. Thus, this is
always the case when Γ is amenable.

Introduction

In this work we prove a structure theorem for tame, metric, minimal dynamical
systems for an arbitrary acting group, Theorem 5.3 and Corollary 5.4. This generalizes
an older result which delt with the case of abelian acting group ([26], [28] and [21]). It
turns out that the key property needed for the simple form of the structure theorem
is amenability, rather than commutativity. In particular Corollary 5.4 asserts that,
when the acting group is amenable, every metric minimal tame system is almost
automorphic. When the group is not amenable the structure of a minimal tame
system is more complicated and may involve a nontrivial strongly proximal factor.

The method of proof we use is basically the same one we applied in [21] and
consists mainly in applying various structure theorems for general minimal systems.
After some eﬀorts to write our proof as a commentary on [21] with indications where
new ideas and results appear, we found that the best way (for the reader as well as
for the author) to present the new results is to start anew, although for some minor
points we nevertheless refer to the older work. For completeness’ sake and in order
to provide the reader with the appropriate background I also reproduce the review
section, with the necessary changes.

A dynamical system is a pair (X, Γ), where X is a compact Hausdorﬀ space and
Γ an inﬁnite abstract group acting as a group of homeomorphisms of the space X.
That is, we are given a homomorphism (not necessarily an isomorphism) of Γ into
Homeo (X). For γ ∈ Γ and x ∈ X we write γx for the image of x under the homeo-
morphism which corresponds to γ. We will often abuse this notation and consider γ
as a homeomorphism of X.

The enveloping semigroup E(X, Γ) of the dynamical system (X, Γ) is deﬁned as the
closure of image of Γ in the product space X X. It is not hard to check that, under
composition of maps, E(X, Γ) is a compact right topological semigroup , i.e. for each
q ∈ E(X, Γ) the map Rq : p (cid:55)→ pq is continuous. In fact the canonical homomorphism
of Γ into E(X, Γ) is a right topological semigroup compactiﬁcation of Γ; i.e. it has a
dense range and for each γ ∈ Γ multiplication on the left Lγ : p (cid:55)→ γp is continuous
on E(X, Γ). This left multiplication by elements of Γ makes (E(X, Γ), Γ) a dynamical
system.

The enveloping semigroup was introduced by Robert Ellis in 1960 and became an
indispensable tool in abstract topological dynamics. However explicit computations
of enveloping semigroups are quite rare. One reason for this is that often E(X, Γ) is
non-metrizable.

TAME MINIMAL DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

Following a pioneering work of A. K¨oller, [29], Glasner and Megrelishvily proved the
following dynamical version of the Bourgain-Fremlin-Talagrand dichotomy theorem,
[20], [22].

0.1. Theorem (A dynamical BFT dichotomy). Let (X, Γ) be a metric dynamical
system and let E(X, Γ) be its enveloping semigroup. We have the following dichotomy.
Either

1. E(X, Γ) is a separable Fr´echet compact space, hence with cardinality card E(X, Γ) ≤

2ℵ0; or

2. the compact space E contains a homeomorphic copy of βN, hence card E(X, Γ) =

22ℵ0 .

A dynamical system is called tame if the ﬁrst alternative occurs, i.e. E(X, Γ) is
Fr´echet. A dynamical characterization of tame metrizable dynamical systems follows,
[22] and [25]:

0.2. Theorem. A compact metric dynamical system (X, Γ) is tame if and only if
every element of E(X, Γ) is a Baire class 1 function from X to itself.

For the deﬁnitions of HAE (hereditarily almost equicontinuous) systems and other
undeﬁned notions which appear in the following theorem, as well as for some further
motivation and examples we refer the reader to the papers [22], [20] and [25].

0.3. Theorem ([25]). Let X be a compact metric G-space. The following conditions
are equivalent:

1. the dynamical system (X, Γ) is hereditarily almost equicontinuous (HAE);
2. the dynamical system (X, Γ) is RN, that is, it admits a proper representation

on a Radon–Nikod´ym Banach space;

3. the enveloping semigroup E(X, Γ) is metrizable.

It thus follows that every metric HAE system is tame.

I would like to thank the two anonymous referees for their corrections and helpful

suggestions.

1. A brief survey of abstract topological dynamics

This section is a brief review of the structure theory of minimal dynamical systems.
We will emphasize some aspects which will be relevant in the present work. For full
details the reader is referred to the books [10], [16], [2] and [34] and the review articles
[33] and [19].

If X is a topological space and A ⊂ X then we use A = cls A, A◦, ∂A and
Ac = X \ A for the closure, interior, boundary and complementation operations on
A, respectively.

A topological dynamical system or brieﬂy a system is a pair (X, Γ), where X is a
compact Hausdorﬀ space and Γ an abstract inﬁnite group which acts on X as a group
of homeomorphisms. When there is no room for confusion we write X for the system
(X, Γ). A sub-system of (X, Γ) is a closed invariant subset Y ⊂ X with the restricted
action. For a point x ∈ X, we let OΓ(x) = {γx : γ ∈ Γ}, and OΓ(x) = cls {γx : γ ∈ Γ}.
These subsets of X are called the orbit and orbit closure of x respectively. We say

4

ELI GLASNER

that (X, Γ) is point transitive if there exists a point x ∈ X with a dense orbit. In
that case x is called a transitive point. If every point is transitive we say that (X, Γ)
is a minimal system. We say that x ∈ X is an almost periodic or a minimal point if
OΓ(x) is a minimal system.

The dynamical system (X, Γ) is topologically transitive if for any two nonempty
open subsets U and V of X there exists some γ ∈ Γ with γU ∩ V (cid:54)= ∅. Clearly a point
transitive system is topologically transitive and when X is metrizable the converse
holds as well:
in a metrizable topologically transitive system the set of transitive
points is a dense Gδ subset of X.

The system (X, Γ) is weakly mixing if the product system (X × X, Γ) (where

γ(x, x(cid:48)) = (γx, γx(cid:48)), x, x(cid:48) ∈ X, γ ∈ Γ) is topologically transitive.

If (Y, Γ) is another system then a continuous onto map π : X → Y satisfying
γ ◦ π = π ◦ γ for every γ ∈ Γ is called a homomorphism of dynamical systems. In
this case we say that (Y, Γ) is a factor of (X, Γ) and also that (X, Γ) is an extension
of (Y, Γ). With the system (X, Γ) we associate the induced action (the hyper system
associated with (X, Γ) ) on the compact space 2X of closed subsets of X equipped
with the Vietoris topology. A subsystem Y of (2X, Γ) is a quasifactor of (X, Γ) if
(cid:83){A : A ∈ Y } = X.

The system (X, Γ) can always be considered as a quasifactor of (X, Γ) by identifying
π→ (Y, Γ) is a homomorphism then in general
x with {x}. Recall that if (X, Γ)
π−1 : Y → 2X is an upper-semi-continuous map and that π : X → Y is open iﬀ
π−1 : Y → 2X is continuous.

We assume for simplicity that our acting group Γ is a discrete group. βΓ will denote

the Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation of Γ. The universal properties of βΓ make it

• a compact semigroup with right continuous multiplication (for a ﬁxed p ∈ βΓ
the map q (cid:55)→ qp, q ∈ βΓ is continuous), and left continuous multiplication
by elements of Γ, considered as elements of βΓ (for a ﬁxed γ ∈ Γ the map
q (cid:55)→ γq, q ∈ βΓ is continuous).

• a dynamical system (βΓ, Γ) under left multiplication by elements of Γ.

The system (βΓ, Γ) is the universal point transitive Γ-system; i.e. for every point
transitive system (X, Γ) and a point x ∈ X with dense orbit, there exists a homomor-
phism of systems (βΓ, Γ) → (X, Γ) which sends e, the identity element of Γ, onto x.
For p ∈ βΓ we let px denote the image of p under this homomorphism. This deﬁnes
an “action” of the semigroup βΓ on every dynamical system. In fact, by universal-
ity there exists a unique homomorphism (βΓ, Γ) → (E(X, Γ), Γ) onto the enveloping
semigroup E(X, Γ) which is also a semigroup homomorphism and we can interpret,
and often do, the βΓ action on X via this homomorphism.

When dealing with the hyper system (2X, Γ) we write p ◦ A for the image of the
closed subset A ⊂ X under p ∈ βΓ to distinguish it from the (usually non-closed)
subset pA = {px : x ∈ A}. If p is the limit of a net γi in Γ then

p ◦ A = {x ∈ X : there are a subnet γij and a net xj ∈ A with x = lim
j

γij xj}.

We always have pA ⊂ p ◦ A.

TAME MINIMAL DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

The compact semigroup βΓ has a rich algebraic structure. For instance for count-
able Γ there are 2c minimal left (necessarily closed) ideals in βΓ all isomorphic as
systems and each serving as a universal minimal system. Each such minimal ideal,
say M , has a subset J of 2c idempotents such that {vM : v ∈ J} is a partition of M
into disjoint isomorphic (non-closed) subgroups. An idempotent in βΓ is called min-
imal if it belongs to some minimal ideal. A point x in a dynamical system (X, Γ) is
a minimal point iﬀ there is some minimal idempotent v in βΓ with vx = x, iﬀ there
exists some v ∈ J with vx = x.

The group of dynamical system automorphisms of (M, Γ), G = Aut (M, Γ) can be
identiﬁed with any one of the groups vM as follows: with α ∈ vM we associate the
automorphism ˆα : (M, Γ) → (M, Γ) given by right multiplication ˆα(p) = pα, p ∈ M .
The group G plays a central role in the algebraic theory.
It carries a natural T1
compact topology, called by Ellis the τ -topology, which is weaker than the relative
topology induced on G = uM as a subset of M . The τ -closure of a subset A of
G consists of those β ∈ G for which the set graph (β) = {(p, pβ) : p ∈ M } is a
subset of the closure in M × M of the set (cid:83){graph (α) : α ∈ A}. Both right and left
multiplication on G are τ continuous and so is inversion.

It is convenient to ﬁx a minimal left ideal M in βΓ and an idempotent u ∈ M . As

explained above we identify G with uM and it follows that for any subset A ⊂ G,

cls τ A = u(u ◦ A) = G ∩ (u ◦ A).

Also in this way we can consider the “action” of G on every system (X, Γ) via the
action of βΓ on X. With every minimal system (X, Γ) and a point x0 ∈ uX = {x ∈
X : ux = x} we associate a τ -closed subgroup

G(X, x0) = {α ∈ G : αx0 = x0},

the Ellis group of the pointed system (X, x0). The quotient space G/G(X, x0) can be
identiﬁed with the subset uX ⊂ X via the map α (cid:55)→ αx0 and the induced quotient
τ -topology is called the τ -topology on uX. Again the τ -topology is weaker than the
relative topology induced on uX as a subset of X, it is T1 and compact, and the
closure operation is given by

cls τ A = u(u ◦ A) = uX ∩ (u ◦ A),

A ⊂ uX.

For a homomorphism π : X → Y with π(x0) = y0 we have

G(X, x0) ⊂ G(Y, y0).

For a τ -closed subgroup F of G the derived group F (cid:48) is given by:

(1.1)

F (cid:48) :=

(cid:92)

{cls τ O : O a τ -open neighborhood of u in F }.

F (cid:48) is a τ -closed normal (in fact characteristic) subgroup of F and it is characterized
as the smallest τ -closed subgroup H of F such that F/H is a compact Hausdorﬀ
topological group. In particular, for an abelian Γ, the topological group G/G(cid:48) is the
Bohr compactiﬁcation of Γ.

A pair of points (x, x(cid:48)) ∈ X × X for a system (X, Γ) is called proximal if there
exists a net γi ∈ Γ and a point z ∈ X such that lim γix = lim γix(cid:48) = z (iﬀ there exists

6

ELI GLASNER

p ∈ βΓ with px = px(cid:48)). We denote by P the set of proximal pairs in X × X. We have

(cid:92)

P =

{ΓV : V a neighborhood of the diagonal in X × X}.

We write P [x] := {x(cid:48) ∈ X : (x, x(cid:48)) ∈ P }. A system (X, Γ) is called proximal when
P = X × X and distal when P = ∆, the diagonal in X × X. It is called strongly
proximal when the following much stronger condition holds: the dynamical system
(M(X), Γ), induced on the compact space M(X) of Borel probability measures on
X, is proximal. A minimal system (X, Γ) is called point distal if there exists a point
x ∈ X such that if x, x(cid:48) is a proximal pair then x = x(cid:48).
The regionally proximal relation on X is deﬁned by

(cid:92)

Q =

{ΓV : V a neighborhood of ∆ in X × X}.

It is easy to verify that Q is trivial — i.e. equals ∆ — iﬀ the system is equicontinuous.

An extension (X, Γ) π→ (Y, Γ) of minimal systems is called a proximal extension if
the relation Rπ = {(x, x(cid:48)) : π(x) = π(x(cid:48))} satisﬁes Rπ ⊂ P , and a distal extension
when Rπ ∩ P = ∆. One can show that every distal extension is open. π is a highly
proximal (HP) extension if for every closed subset A of X with π(A) = Y , necessarily
A = X. It is easy to see that a HP extension is proximal. In the metric case an
extension (X, Γ) π→ (Y, Γ) of minimal systems is HP iﬀ it is an almost 1-1 extension,
that is the set {x ∈ X : π−1(π(x)) = {x}} is a dense Gδ subset of X.

The map π is strongly proximal if for every y ∈ Y and every probability measure
ν with supp ν ⊂ π−1(y), there exists a net γi ∈ Γ and a point x ∈ X such that
limi γiν = δx in the weak∗ topology on the space M(X) of probability measures on
X.

The extension π is called an equicontinuous extension if for every (cid:15), a neighborhood
of the diagonal ∆ = {(x, x) : x ∈ X} ⊂ X × X, there exists a neighborhood of
the diagonal δ such that γ(δ ∩ Rπ) ⊂ (cid:15) for every γ ∈ Γ.
In the metric case an
equicontinuous extension is also called an isometric extension.

A minimal dynamical system (X, Γ) is called almost automorphic if it has the form
X θ→ Z, where Z is equicontinuous and θ is almost one-to-one. More generally, an
extension of minimal systems π : X → Y is called an almost automorphic extension
if it has the form X θ→ Z σ→ Y , where θ is an almost one-to-one extension, σ is an
isometric extension and π = σ ◦ θ.

The extension π is a weakly mixing extension when Rπ as a subsystem of the product

system (X × X, Γ) is topologically transitive.

The algebraic language is particularly suitable for dealing with such notions. For
example an extension (X, Γ) π→ (Y, Γ) of minimal systems is a proximal extension iﬀ
the Ellis groups G(X, x0) = A and G(Y, y0) = F coincide. It is distal iﬀ for every
y ∈ Y , and x ∈ π−1(y), π−1(y) = G(Y, y)x; iﬀ:

for every y = py0 ∈ Y , p an element of M , π−1(y) = pπ−1(y0) = pF x0,
where F = G(Y, y0).

In particular (X, Γ) is distal iﬀ Gx = X for some (hence every) x ∈ X. The extension
π is an equicontinuous extension iﬀ it is a distal extension and, denoting G(X, x0) = A

and G(Y, y0) = F ,

F (cid:48) ⊂ A.

In this case, setting A0 = (cid:84)
g∈F gAg−1, the group F/A0 is the group of the group
extension ˜π associated with the equicontinuous extension π. More precisely, there
exists a minimal dynamical system ( ˜X, Γ), with G( ˜X, ˜x0) = A0, on which the compact
Hausdorﬀ topological group K = F/A0 acts as a group of automorphisms and we have
the following commutative diagram

˜X/L with L = A/A0 ⊂ F/A0 = K. ( ˜X = X iﬀ A is a normal subgroup of F .)

A minimal system (X, Γ) is called incontractible if the union of minimal subsets
is dense in every product system (X n, Γ). This is the case iﬀ p ◦ Gx = X for some
(hence every) x ∈ X and p ∈ M . When Γ is abelian Gx is always dense in X so that
every minimal system is incontractible. However the following relative notion is an
important tool even when Γ is abelian.

We say that (X, Γ) π→ (Y, Γ) is a RIC (relatively incontractible) extension if:
for every y = py0 ∈ Y , p an element of M , π−1(y) = p◦uπ−1(y0) = p◦F x0,
where F = G(Y, y0).

One can show that every RIC extension is open and that every distal extension is
RIC. It then follows that every distal extension is open.

We have the following theorem from [12] about the interpolation of equicontinuous

extensions. For a proof see [16], Theorem X.2.1.

1.1. Theorem. Let π : X → Y be a RIC extension of minimal systems. Fix a point
x0 ∈ X with ux0 = x0 and let y0 = π(x0). Let A = G(X, x0) and F = G(Y, y0). Then
there exists a commutative diagram of pointed systems

the map π∗ is open and the maps θ and θ∗ are almost 1-1. The explicit constructions
is as follows. The set valued map π−1 : Y → 2X (where the latter is the compact
space of closed subsets of X, equipped with the Hausdorﬀ, or Vietoris, topology) is
upper-semicontinuous and we let Y0 ⊂ Y be the set of continuity points of this map.
Set Y ∗ = cls {π−1(y) : y ∈ Y0} ⊂ 2X, and X ∗ = X ∨ Y ∗ = cls {(x, π−1(y)) : y ∈
Y0, π(x) = y} ⊂ X × Y ∗. By the upper-semicontinuity of π−1 every y∗ ∈ Y ∗ is
contained in a ﬁber π−1(y) for some y ∈ Y and we let θ(y∗) = y. The maps π∗ and θ∗
are the restriction to X ∗ of the coordinate projections on X and Y ∗ respectively. One
then shows that X ∗ = {(x, y∗) : x ∈ y∗ ∈ Y ∗} and that indeed, π∗ is open and the
maps θ and θ∗ are highly proximal. The O-shadow diagram collapses, i.e. Y = Y ∗,
X = X ∗ and π = π∗ iﬀ π : X → Y is an open map; iﬀ the map π−1 : Y → 2X is
continuous.

π∗ is RIC and θ, θ∗ are proximal (thus we still have A = G(X, x0) = G(X ∗, x∗

and F = G(Y, y0) = G(Y ∗, y∗
0)). The concrete description of these objects uses
quasifactors and the circle operation:

Y ∗ = {p ◦ F x0 : p ∈ M } ⊂ 2X,

X ∗ = {(x, y∗) : x ∈ y∗ ∈ Y ∗} ⊂ X × Y ∗

and

θ(p ◦ F x0) = py0,

θ∗(x, y∗) = x,

π∗(x, y∗) = y∗,

(p ∈ M ),

where F = G(Y, y0). The map θ is an isomorphisms (hence π = π∗) when and only
when π is already RIC.

We say that π : (X, Γ) → (Y, Γ) has a relatively invariant measure (or that is a

RIM extension), if there exists a projection P : C(X) → C(Y ) such that

1. P (f ) ≥ 0 for f ≥ 0 in C(X).
2. P (1) = 1.
3. P (h ◦ π) = h for every h ∈ C(Y ).
4. P (f ◦ γ) = P (f ) ◦ γ for every f ∈ C(X) and γ ∈ Γ.

This property is equivalent to the existence of a continuous section, i.e. a continuous
Γ equivariant map y (cid:55)→ λy from Y into M(X) such that π(λy) = δy for every y ∈
Y . Here and in the sequel we use the same letter π to denote the induced map
π : M(X) → M(Y ) on the spaces of probability measures. Sometimes though we will
write π∗ for the induced map.

In the sequel we will need the following lemmas.

1.2. Lemma. Let π : (X, Γ) → (Y, Γ) be a RIM homomorphism of minimal metric
systems with section y (cid:55)→ λy. Then there exists a dense Gδ subset Yf s ⊂ Y with the
property that supp (λy) = π−1(y) for every y ∈ Yf s.

Proof. It is easy to see that, in general, the map y (cid:55)→ supp (λy) from Y into 2X is
lower-semicontinuous; i.e. whenever yi → y in Y then lim inf supp (λyi) ⊃ supp (λy).
Such a map admits a dense Gδ set of continuity points which we denote by Yf s. We
claim that for each y ∈ Yf s the measure λy has full support, i.e. supp (λy) = π−1(y).
To see this observe ﬁrst that, by minimality, cls (∪{supp (λy) : y ∈ Y }) = X. Now
if y ∈ Yf s and x ∈ π−1(y) then there is a sequence xi → x with xi ∈ supp (λyi),
for some sequence yi ∈ Y . Necessarily π(xi) = yi → y and, as y ∈ Yf s, we have
lim supp (λyi) = supp (λy). Now

x ∈ lim inf supp (λyi) = lim supp (λyi) = supp (λy).

1.3. Lemma. Let π : (X, Γ) → (Y, Γ) be a RIM homomorphism of minimal metric
systems with section y (cid:55)→ λy. Let (1.4) be the associated O-shadow diagram. Then
the open homomorphism π∗ is RIM as well.

Proof. We use the notations following the deﬁnition of the O-shadow diagram (1.4).
Let Y0 (cid:51) yi → y ∈ Y \ Y0 and let Y ∗ (cid:51) y∗ = lim π−1(yi). By the lower-semicontinuity
of the map λy (cid:55)→ supp (λy) we see that supp (λy) ⊂ y∗. Thus for every such y
supp (λy) ⊂ (cid:84){y∗ ∈ Y ∗ : y∗ ⊂ π−1(y)}.
It is now easy to check that the map
(cid:3)
y∗ (cid:55)→ λθ(y∗) × δy∗ is a section for π∗.

Given a homomorphism π : (X, Γ) → (Y, Γ) of minimal metric systems there is an

the map ˜π has a RIM and the maps θ and ˜θ are strongly proximal. It can be shown
that every isometric extension has a RIM and is open. See [15] for more details, also
a treatment of SPI systems can be found in [17].

We say that a minimal system (X, Γ) is a strictly PI system if there is an ordinal η
(which is countable when X is metrizable) and a family of systems {(Wι, wι)}ι≤η such
that (i) W0 is the trivial system, (ii) for every ι < η there exists a homomorphism
φι : Wι+1 → Wι which is either proximal or equicontinuous (isometric when X is
metrizable), (iii) for a limit ordinal ν ≤ η the system Wν is the inverse limit of the
systems {Wι}ι<ν, and (iv) Wη = X. We say that (X, Γ) is a PI-system if there exists
a strictly PI system ˜X and a proximal homomorphism θ : ˜X → X.

If in the deﬁnition of (strictly) PI-systems we replace proximal extensions by HP
extensions (almost 1-1 extensions in the metric case) we get the notion of (strictly)
HPI (AI-systems in the metric case). If we replace the proximal extensions by trivial
extensions (i.e. we do not allow proximal extensions at all) we have I-systems. In this

terminology the structure theorem for distal systems (Furstenberg [13], 1963) can be
stated as follows:

1.4. Theorem. A metric minimal system is distal iﬀ it is an I-system.

And, the Veech-Ellis structure theorem for point distal systems (Veech [33], 1970

and Ellis [8], 1973):

1.5. Theorem. A metric minimal dynamical system is point distal iﬀ it is an AI-
system.

The structure theorem for the general minimal system is proved in [12] and [31]
(see also [33]) and asserts that every minimal system admits a canonically deﬁned
proximal extension which is a weakly mixing RIC extension of a strictly PI system.
Both the Furstenberg and the Veech-Ellis structure theorems are corollaries of this
general structure theorem.

Two useful criteria on minimal systems for being PI and HPI are given in theorems

of Bronstein [5] and van der Woude [35], respectively.

In the sequel we will mostly deal with metrizable systems. So from now on, unless
we explicitly say otherwise all the dynamical systems will be assumed to be
metrizable.

All of the above mentioned theorems have their relative versions. One starts with
a homomorphism π : (X, Γ) → (Y, Γ) between minimal systems and then all the var-
ious notions deﬁned above, equicontinuity, distality, point-distality etc. have natural
relative analogues.

We will use two such relative theorems which I now proceed to describe.

1.7. Deﬁnition. Let π : X → Y be a homomorphism of minimal systems. Then π is
a point distal extension if there is a point x0 ∈ X such that P [x0] ∩ π−1(y0) = {x0},
where y0 = π(x0). A point such as x0 is called a Y -distal point.

1.8. Theorem (Veech [32], Ellis [11]). Let π : X → Y be a homomorphism of metric
minimal systems. Then π is point distal iﬀ π is an AI extension and the set of Y -
distal points is a dense Gδ subset of X. If π is open then it is point distal iﬀ it is
strictly AI.

A homomorphism π : (X, Γ) → (Y, Γ) is called semiopen if the interior of π(U )
is nonempty for every nonempty open subset U of X. When X is minimal every
π : (X, Γ) → (Y, Γ) is semiopen (see Lemma 2.5 below). We will say that a subset
W ⊂ X × X is a S-set if it is closed, invariant, topologically transitive, and the
restriction to W of the projection maps are semiopen.

1.9. Theorem (van der Woude, [35]). A homomorphism π : X → Y between metric
minimal systems (X, Γ) and (Y, Γ) is a point distal extension iﬀ every S-set of Rπ =
{(x, x(cid:48)) ∈ X × X : π(x) = π(x(cid:48))} is minimal.

2. On semiopen maps

2.1. Lemma. Let π : X → Y be a continuous surjection between compact Hausdorﬀ
spaces. The conditions 1 and 2 below are equivalent. If X is metrizable then the three
conditions are equivalent:
1. π is semiopen.
2. The preimage of every dense subset in Y is dense in X.
3. The set

X0 = {x ∈ X : the set valued map π−1 : Y → 2X is continuous at π(x)}
is dense in X.

Proof. The equivalence of 1 and 2 is straightforward. For any continuous surjection
π : X → Y the corresponding set map π−1 : Y → 2X is upper-semicontinuous and,
when X is metrizable, this implies that it has a dense Gδ subset Y0 ⊂ Y of continuity
points. Assuming 2 we conclude that X0 = π−1(Y0) is a dense Gδ subset of X.
Conversely if 3 is valid and U ⊂ X is open and nonempty, then U ∩ X0 (cid:54)= ∅ and if x0
is any point in this intersection then π is open at x0, so that π(U ) is a neighborhood
(cid:3)
of π(x0) and we conclude that π(U )◦ (cid:54)= ∅.
β
2.2. Lemma. Let X α→ Z
→ Y , where X, Y and Z are compact metric spaces, α
and β are continuous surjections, and α is semiopen. For y ∈ Y set Zy = β−1(y) and
Xy = (β ◦ α)−1(y) = α−1(Zy). Then there is a dense Gδ subset Y0 ⊂ Y such that for
every y ∈ Y0 the restriction α : Xy → Zy is semiopen.

Proof. Let V ⊂ X be a nonempty open subset. Set

YV = {y ∈ Y : α(V )◦ ∩ Zy (cid:54)= ∅} ∪ {y ∈ Y : V ∩ Xy = ∅} := YV,1 ∪ YV,2.

We will show that VY is open and dense.

Suppose yn → y is a convergent sequence with yn (cid:54)∈ YV . Then, as Y c

V = Y c

V,1 ∩ Y c

V,2,

we have

• For all n

yn ∈ Y c

V,1 ⇒ α(V )◦ ∩ Zyn = ∅ ⇒ Zyn ⊂ (α(V )◦)c ⇒

Zy ⊂ (α(V )◦)c ⇒ α(V )◦ ∩ Zy = ∅ ⇒ y ∈ Y c

V,1.

• And, for all n
yn ∈ Y c

V,2 ⇒ V ∩ Xyn (cid:54)= ∅ ⇒ V ∩ lim sup Xyn (cid:54)= ∅ ⇒

V ∩ Xy (cid:54)= ∅ ⇒ y ∈ Y c

V,2.

This shows that YV is open.

Next let O ⊂ Y be a nonempty open set. We will show that O ∩ YV (cid:54)= ∅.

• Case1 : Suppose β−1(O) ∩ α(V ) (cid:54)= ∅.

Then β−1(O) ∩ (α(V )◦ ∪ ∂(α(V )) (cid:54)= ∅. As α is a semiopen map, the set
∂(α(V )) has an empty interior and it follows that β−1(O) ∩ α(V )◦ (cid:54)= ∅. Let z
be a point in this intersection and set y = β(z). Then y ∈ O and z ∈ α(V )◦ ∩Zy
imply that O ∩ YV,1 (cid:54)= ∅.

• Case 2 : Suppose β−1(O) ∩ α(V ) = ∅.

It then follows that for every y ∈ O we have V ∩Xy = ∅, whence y ∈ O ∩YV,2.
Let now {Vi}∈N be an enumeration of a basis for open sets on X. Set Yi = YVi and

let Y0 = ∩i∈NYi.

We now check that the set Y0 ⊂ Y satisﬁes the requirement of the lemma. In fact,
suppose y ∈ Y0. We want to show that α : Xy → Zy is semiopen. Let then U ⊂ Xy
be a nonempty open subset. With no loss of generality we assume that U = V ∩ Xy
for some V in our basis {Vi}i∈N. In particular then V ∩ Xy (cid:54)= ∅, whence y (cid:54)∈ YV,2.
But y ∈ Y0 ⊂ YV , hence y ∈ YV,1, i.e. α(V )◦ ∩ Zy (cid:54)= ∅.
If z is a point in this
intersection then z = α(x) for some x ∈ V ∩ Xy = U . Thus α(U )◦ (cid:54)= ∅ and our proof
(cid:3)
is complete.

2.3. Corollary. Let π : X → Y be a continuous semiopen surjection between compact
metric spaces. Let Rπ = {(x, x(cid:48)) ∈ X × X : π(x) = π(x(cid:48))}. Suppose W ⊂ Rπ is
a closed subset such that (π × π)(W ) = ∆Y = {(y, y) : y ∈ Y }. Suppose further
that the restrictions of the projection maps pi : X × X → X (i = 1, 2) to W are
semiopen. Then there is a dense Gδ subset Yso ⊂ Y such that for each y ∈ Yso the
maps pi : W ∩ (π−1(y) × π−1(y)) → π−1(y) are semiopen.

Proof. Apply Lemma 2.2 to W
intersection of the two corresponding dense Gδ sets of Y .

pi→ X π→ Y with i = 1, 2 and then take let Yso be the
(cid:3)

A result of Ditor and Eiﬂer from 1972, [6] asserts that a continuous surjection
π : X → Y between compact Hausdorﬀ spaces X and Y is open iﬀ the induced map
π∗ : M(X) → M(Y ) is an open surjection. In the course of the proof of our main
theorem (Theorem 5.3) we will need the following analogous result (in the metric
case) for semiopen maps. For the proof we refer to [21, Theorem 2.3].

2.4. Theorem. Let π : X → Y be a continuous surjection between compact metric
spaces which is semiopen. Then the induced map π∗ : M(X) → M(Y ) is a semiopen
surjection.

Recall the following well known result; for completeness we include a proof.

2.5. Lemma. Let π : (X, Γ) → (Y, Γ) be a homomorphism between minimal systems.
Then π is semiopen.

Proof. Let W ⊂ X be a closed set with nonempty interior. By minimality of
(X, Γ) there is a ﬁnite set {γ1, . . . , γn} ⊂ Γ with X = (cid:83)n
i=1 γiW . Therefore Y =
(cid:83)n
i=1 π(γiW ) and it follows that for some i the interior of the closed set π(γiW ) =
(cid:3)
γiπ(W ) is nonempty. Thus, as required, also π(W )◦ (cid:54)= ∅.

3. A key proposition on diffused measures

As explained above we ﬁx a minimal ideal M in βΓ and let u be an idempotent
in M . We denote the subgroup uM of M by G and identify it with the group
of automorphisms of the universal Γ-minimal system (M, Γ), where for α ∈ G the
corresponding automorphism Rα : M → M is given by right multiplication p (cid:55)→ pα.
For an abelian Γ each subgroup vM ⊂ M , where v is an idempotent in M , is dense
in M and it follows that the G-dynamical system (M, G) (where G acts by right
multiplication) is minimal. In the general case the compact dynamical system (M, G)
admits a minimal subset and it follows that there is a minimal idempotent v such
that cls (vG) is minimal under the right G action.
In the sequel we will need the
following slightly stronger statement.

3.1. Lemma. If (Y, Γ) is a minimal proximal system then

1. For every minimal idempotent v ∈ M there is a unique point y0 ∈ Y with

vy0 = y0 and moreover, vy = y0 for every y ∈ Y .

2. For every y ∈ Y there is a minimal idempotent v ∈ M such that vy = y and

the G-system (cls (vG), G) is minimal.

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is clear. For the second observe that the closed set {p ∈ M :
py = y} is G-invariant (under the right action of G) and hence contains a G-minimal
set. Clearly this set contains an idempotent, and any such idempotent v satisﬁes the
(cid:3)
required property.

As our choice of u was arbitrary we can, and will from now on, assume that

cls (uG) = cls (Gu) = cls (G) is G-minimal.

3.2. Lemma. Let (Z ∗, Γ) be a minimal metric system and let φ : (Z ∗, Γ) → (Y, Γ) be
its maximal proximal factor. Suppose further that we have the following diagram

Z ∗ θ→ Z σ→ Y,

where σ is a maximal isometric (i.e. equicontinuous) extension, θ is an almost 1-1
extension, and φ = θ ◦ σ (i.e. φ is an almost automorphic extension). Let O be a
nonempty open subset of Z ∗.

1. There is a nonempty open subset V ⊂ O such that θ−1(θ(V )) ⊂ O.
2. There is a nonempty open subset W ⊂ O such that cls τ (W ∩ uZ ∗) ⊂ O.

Proof. 1. Suppose O ⊂ Z ∗ is a nonempty open set for which the statement of the
lemma fails. Choose a point z∗ ∈ O such that θ−1(θ(z∗)) = {z∗} and let Vn ⊂ O
be a sequence of open balls centered at z∗ with diam (Vn) (cid:38) 0. By assumption
there are pairs of points zn ∈ Vn and z(cid:48)
n). However, as
limn→∞ θ−1(θ(zn)) = {z∗}, we have z(cid:48)
n → z∗ in contradiction of the fact that O is a
neighborhood of z∗.

n (cid:54)∈ O with θ(zn) = θ(z(cid:48)

2. Since Z is an isometric extension of the proximal system Y , uZ is a closed
subset of Z and the τ -topology on uZ coincides with its compact Hausdorﬀ group
topology. Since θ is an almost one-to-one map, the restriction θ (cid:22) uZ ∗ : uZ ∗ → uZ
is a homeomorphism of uZ ∗, equipped with the τ topology, onto uZ. Let O ⊂ Z ∗ be
a nonempty open set. Let V ⊂ O be as in part 1, and let W be a nonempty open

subset such that W ⊂ V . Now

cls τ (W ∩ uZ ∗) = θ−1(cls τ (θ(W ∩ uZ)) ∩ uZ ∗

= θ−1(θ(W ∩ uZ)) ∩ uZ ∗

⊂ θ−1(θ(W )) = θ−1(θ(W ))
⊂ θ−1(θ(V )) ⊂ O.

(cid:3)

3.3. Lemma. Let (X, Γ) be a minimal metric system and let φ : (X, Γ) → (Y, Γ) be
its maximal proximal factor. Suppose further that we have the following diagram

X

ρ
→ Z ∗ θ→ Z σ→ Y,

where ρ and σ are maximal isometric extensions, θ is an almost 1-1 extension, and
φ = σ ◦ θ ◦ ρ. Fix a minimal ideal M ⊂ βΓ and an idempotent u ∈ M as above. Let
U be an open subset of X such that U ∩ uX (cid:54)= ∅. Then

cls τ (U ∩ uX) ⊃ ρ−1(ρ(U )) ∩ uX.

Proof. Fix a point x0 ∈ X with ux0 = x0 and let z∗
and Y respectively. Let

0, z0 and y0 be its images in Z ∗, Z

A = G(X, x0) = {α ∈ G : αx0 = x0}, and

F = G(Z, z0) = G(Z ∗, z∗

0) = {α ∈ G : αz0 = z0} = {α ∈ G : αz∗

0 = z∗

0}.

Note that, as Y is a proximal system, we have G(Y, y0) = G. The assumption that
ρ is an isometric extension implies that B = F/A is a homogeneous space of the
Hausdorﬀ compact topological group F/ ∩ {f Af −1 : f ∈ F } (with respect to its
τ -topology). The fact that (Z, Γ) is the maximal equicontinuous extension of (Y, Γ)
(within X) implies that F ⊃ G(cid:48) and that G(cid:48)A = AG(cid:48) = F . Let h : M → X denote
the evaluation map p (cid:55)→ px0.

Let U be a nonempty open subset of X such that U ∩ uX (cid:54)= ∅. Set ˜U = h−1(U ) =
{p ∈ M : px0 ∈ U }. Then ˜U is an open subset of M with ˜U ∩ G (cid:54)= ∅ and, by
minimality of the G-system (cls (G), G), the collection { ˜U α : α ∈ G} is an open cover
of cls G. Choose a ﬁnite subcover, say { ˜U αi : i = 1, 2, . . . , n}. Now

n
(cid:91)

i=1

cls τ ( ˜U αi ∩ G) =

n
(cid:91)

i=1

cls τ ( ˜U ∩ G)αi = G;

hence cls τ ( ˜U ∩ G) has a nonempty τ -interior. Since cls τ ( ˜U ∩ G) is also τ -closed, it
must contain a left translate of G(cid:48), say βG(cid:48) for some β ∈ G (this follows from the
deﬁnition of G(cid:48), see equation (1.1)). Projecting back to X via h we get
cls τ (U ∩ uX) = h(cls τ ( ˜U ∩ G))

⊃ βG(cid:48)x0 = βG(cid:48)Ax0 = βF x0
= (βF β−1)βx0 = ρ−1(ρ(βx0)).

Let O = ρ(U ), then O is a nonempty open subset of Z ∗ and by Lemma 3.2 there is
a nonempty open subset W ⊂ O such that cls τ (W ∩uZ ∗) ⊂ O. Set U1 = ρ−1(W )∩U .

TAME MINIMAL DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

15

Then U1 is a nonempty open subset of X and by the above argument there exists
β1 ∈ G with ρ−1(ρ(β1x0)) ⊂ cls τ (U1 ∩ uX) ⊂ cls τ (U ∩ uX). Now

ρ(β1x0) ∈ ρ(cls τ (U1 ∩ uX))
= cls τ (ρ(U1) ∩ uZ ∗)
⊂ cls τ (W ∩ uZ ∗) ⊂ O = ρ(U ).

Thus we have shown that for every nonempty open subset U ⊂ X which meets
uX, the set cls τ (U ∩ uX) contains a full ﬁber ρ−1(z∗) for some z∗ ∈ ρ(U ). Since ρ is
an open map we conclude that

as required.

(cid:3)

cls τ (U ∩ uX) ⊃ ρ−1(ρ(U )) ∩ uX

This lemma has the following surprizing corollary.

3.4. Corollary. In the situation described in Lemma 3.3, if σ : Z → Y is a ﬁnite to
one isometric extension then ρ : X → Z ∗ is an isomorphism, i.e. φ : X → Y (with
φ = σ ◦ θ ◦ ρ) is an almost automorphic extension. In particular if, in addition, Y is
the trivial one point system, then X = Z is a ﬁnite system.

0 and ρ−1(z∗

Proof. Let z0 ∈ Z be a point with θ−1(z0) = {z∗
0} a singleton. With no loss of
generality we can assume that uz0 = z0 (see Lemma 3.1). Note that then also
0 = z∗
uz∗
0) ⊂ uX. Let y0 = uy0 = σ(z0) ∈ Y and let X0 = φ−1(y0),
0 = ρ(X0) and Z0 = σ−1(y0) = uZ. By our assumptions Z0 is a ﬁnite set and
Z ∗
therefore {z∗
0) is a relatively open
subset of X0. We claim that ρ−1(z∗
0) is a singleton. If this is not the case, then there
is an open subset U ⊂ X with ∅ (cid:54)= U ∩ ρ−1(z∗

0} is a relatively open subset of uZ ∗

0 . Then ρ−1(z∗

0). By Lemma 3.3 we have

0) (cid:40) ρ−1(z∗

cls τ (U ∩ uX) ⊃ ρ−1(ρ(U )) ∩ uX.

But cls τ (U ∩ uX) ⊂ U (because ρ is an isometric extension) and z∗
ρ−1(ρ(U )) ∩ uX ⊃ ρ−1(z∗
a contradiction. Thus ρ−1(z∗
as claimed.

0 ∈ ρ(U ), whence
0),
0) is indeed a singleton and it follows that ρ is one-to-one
(cid:3)

0). It follows that the set U contains the whole ﬁber ρ−1(z∗

3.5. Proposition. Let (X, Γ) be a minimal metric system and let φ : (X, Γ) → (Y, Γ)
be its maximal proximal factor. Suppose further that we have the following diagram

ρ
→ Z ∗ θ→ Z σ→ Y,
where ρ and σ are maximal isometric extensions, θ is an almost 1-1 extension, and
φ = σ ◦ θ ◦ ρ.

1. For every z∗ ∈ Z ∗ the ﬁber ρ−1(z∗) has the structure of a homogeneous space
of a compact Hausdorﬀ topological group and we let λz∗ be the corresponding
Haar measure on this ﬁber. In particular ρ is a RIM and open extension and
z∗ (cid:55)→ λz∗, Z ∗ → M(X), is the corresponding section. Let Λ : M(Z ∗) → M(X),

Rη = {µ ∈ M(X0) : there exists γ ∈ Γ with d(γµ, Mm(X0)) < η}
is dense in M(X0). Clearly R = (cid:84){Rη : η > 0} is the required dense Gδ subset of
(cid:3)
M(X0).

4. Some properties of tame minimal systems

4.1. Theorem. ([20]) Let (X, Γ) be a metric tame dynamical system. Let M(X)
denote the compact convex set of probability measures on X (with the weak∗ topology).
Then each element p ∈ E(X, Γ) deﬁnes an element p∗ ∈ E(M(X), Γ) and the map
p (cid:55)→ p∗ is both a dynamical system and a semigroup isomorphism of E(X, Γ) onto
E(M(X), Γ).

TAME MINIMAL DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

17

Proof. Since E(X, Γ) is Fr´echet we have for every p ∈ E a sequence γi → p of
elements of Γ converging to p. Now for every f ∈ C(X) and every probability measure
ν ∈ M(X) we get, by the Riesz representation theorem and Lebesgue’s dominated
convergence theorem,

γiν(f ) = ν(f ◦ γi) → ν(f ◦ p) := p∗ν(f ).

Since the Baire class 1 function f ◦ p is well deﬁned and does not depend upon the
choice of the convergent sequence γi → p, this deﬁnes the map p (cid:55)→ p∗ uniquely. It
is easy to see that this map is an isomorphism of dynamical systems, whence also
a semigroup isomorphism. Finally as Γ is dense in both enveloping semigroups, it
(cid:3)
follows that this isomorphism is onto.

As we have seen, when (X, Γ) is a metrizable tame system, the enveloping semigroup
E(X, Γ) is a separable Fr´echet space. Therefore, each element p ∈ E is a limit of a
sequence of elements of Γ, p = limn→∞ γn. It follows that the subset C(p) of continuity
points of each p ∈ E is a dense Gδ subset of X. More generally, if A ⊂ X is any
closed subset then the set CA(p) of continuity points of the map p (cid:22) A : A → X is a
dense Gδ subset of A. For an idempotent v = v2 ∈ E we write Cv for CvX(v). For a
special case of the next lemma see [23, Theorem 9.2]

4.2. Lemma. Let (X, Γ) be a metrizable tame dynamical system and π : X → Y a
RIM extension, with section y (cid:55)→ νy, such that (Y, Γ) is a proximal system.

1. pνy = νpy for every p ∈ E(X, Γ) and every y ∈ Y . In particular, we have

νpy(pX) = 1.

2. For every minimal idempotent v ∈ E(X, Γ) there is a unique y ∈ Y such
that vy = y. For such v we have vX ⊂ π−1(y), so that νy(vX) = 1 and
supp (νy) ⊂ vX ∩ π−1(y) = vπ−1(y).

3. For an idempotent v in E(X, Γ) we have Cv ⊂ vX.
4. If X is minimal then for every point y of the dense Gδ subset Yf s ⊂ Y (see
Lemma 1.2) and v a minimal idempotent in E(X, Γ) with vy = y, Cv is a dense
Gδ subset of π−1(y), and vX is a residual subset of π−1(y).

Proof. 1. As p : X → X is a Baire 1 function, the measure pνx is well deﬁned and the
equality follows from the continuity of the section.

2. Clear.
3. Given x ∈ Cv choose a sequence xn ∈ vX with limn→∞ xn = x. We then have

vx = limn→∞ vxn = limn→∞ xn = x, hence Cv ⊂ vX.

4. For vy = y ∈ Yf s we have supp (νy) = π−1(y). By part 2 we have νy(vX) = 1,
whence vX is dense in π−1(y). Now Cv = CvX(v) = Cπ−1(y)(v) and it follows that Cv
is a dense Gδ subset of π−1(y). By part 3 Cv ⊂ vX and it follows that vX is residual
in π−1(y).

(cid:3)

4.3. Corollary. Let (X, Γ) be a metrizable tame dynamical system admitting a Γ
invariant probability measure, and let v be a minimal idempotent in E(X, Γ). Then
C(v) ⊂ vX, C(v) is a dense Gδ subset of X, and vX is residual in X.

4.4. Theorem. Let (X, Γ) be a metrizable tame dynamical system and π : X → Y a
RIM extension, with section y (cid:55)→ νy, such that (Y, Γ) is a proximal system. Then the
extension π is point distal. In particular, a metric tame minimal system admitting
an invariant probability measure is point distal.

that every S-
Proof. We will prove that the condition in Theorem 1.9 holds; i.e.
set in Rπ is minimal. So let W ⊂ Rπ be an S-set. For y ∈ Y we write Wy =
W ∩ (π−1(y) × π−1(y)).

By Corollary 2.3 there is a dense Gδ subset Yso ⊂ Y such that for each y ∈ Yso the
projection maps pi : Wy → π−1(y) (i = 1, 2) are semiopen. Next recall that the set
Wtr of transitive points of W forms a dense Gδ subset of W . By the Ulam theorem
there is a dense Gδ subset Ytr ⊂ Y such that for each y ∈ Ytr, Wtr ∩ (π−1(y) × π−1(y))
is a dense Gδ subset of Wy. Thus, the set Yso ∩ Ytr ∩ Yf s is also a dense Gδ subset of
Y (see Lemma 1.2.4 for the deﬁnition of Yf s). Pick a point y in this intersection.

Let v be a minimal idempotent in E(X, Γ) such that vy = y. By Lemma 4.2.4
vX ⊂ π−1(y) is a residual subset of π−1(y). As y ∈ Yso we conclude that the sets
−1(vX) (i = 1, 2) are residual subsets of Wy (see Lemma 2.1). Now pick a
W ∩ pi
point (x, x(cid:48)) in the set

Wtr ∩ (p1

−1(vX) ∩ p2
(which is residual in Wy). We then have v(x, x(cid:48)) = (vx, vx(cid:48)) = (x, x(cid:48)), so that G(x, x(cid:48))
is a minimal set. On the other hand, being a point in Wtr, we have G(x, x(cid:48)) = W
and our proof is complete. For the last assertion, take Y to be the trivial one point
(cid:3)
system.

5. The structure of tame metric minimal dynamical systems

5.1. Deﬁnition. Let us call a minimal dynamical system (X, Γ) standard if it has the
following structure:

X π→ Y,

where (Y, Γ) is a strongly proximal system and π is a RIM extension.

The next theorem, from [15], is just a description of the RIM shadow diagram (1.6),
associated to the map X → {∗}, the trivial one point system. The fact that, when
X is tame so is ˜X, follows from Theorem 4.1.

5.2. Theorem. Every minimal system (X, Γ) has a standard extension ˜X

Note that if the map ρ is an isomorphism; i.e.

the largest isometric extension
corresponding to π∗∗ is trivial, then the AI tower for π collapses to the diagram
(5.2) which is exactly what we are after. Thus our goal is to show that indeed ρ is
necessarily an isomorphism.

3. In order to arrive at a contradiction, we now assume that ρ is a nontrivial
isometric extension. The map ρ, being isometric, is open RIM extension with unique
section z∗ (cid:55)→ λz∗ (where λz∗ is the Haar measure on the homogeneous space of the
associated compact group, see the diagram (1.2)).

Consider the subdiagram of (5.3)

θ, and φ = σ ◦ θ1 ◦ ρ : ˆX → Y ∗). Let y∗
0 = y∗

is a dense Gδ subset of M( ˆX0).

Set ˜X0 = (θ∗ ◦ θ∗

0 ). Also, set
Mm(X ∗∗

0 ) := ψ−1(Mm( ˆX0)) and

Mm( ˜X0) := (θ∗ ◦ θ∗

Now ˆR is a dense subset of M( ˆX0) and Lemma 2.1 implies that R∗∗ is a dense
0 ). Therefore R(cid:48) is a dense subset of M( ˜X0). From the deﬁnition of
subset of M(X ∗∗
R (5.4) it is easy to deduce that it is a Gδ set and because it contains R(cid:48), it is in fact
a dense Gδ subset of M( ˜X0).

4. Recall that the system ( ˜X, Γ) is tame and, by Theorem 4.1 so is (M( ˜X), Γ).
Moreover we have E( ˜X, Γ) = E(M( ˜X), Γ). In particular u ∈ E(M( ˜X), Γ), as a Baire
1 function, has a dense Gδ set of continuity points. Moreover, Cu = C
(u), the
set of continuity points of u restricted to the set uM( ˜X), is a dense Gδ subset of
uM( ˜X) and, by Lemma 4.2.3,

uM( ˜X)

Cu ⊂ uM( ˜X).
As ρ and σ are isometric extensions and θ1 is an almost one-to-one extension, it
is easy to see that u ˆX = ˆX0. As ψ is semiopen and a point distal extension, it
0 and therefore also that u ˜X = ˜X0.
follows that uX ∗∗ = X ∗∗
It follows that the
collection of ﬁnite convex combinations of point masses picked from u ˜X forms a
dense subset of M( ˜X0). In turn, this implies that uM( ˜X) = M( ˜X0) and we conclude
that S := Cu ∩ R ⊂ uM( ˜X) is a dense Gδ subset of M( ˜X0).

Now if ν ∈ S then uν = ν and, u being a minimal idempotent, the closure of the Γ
orbit of ν in M( ˜X) is a minimal set. On the other hand, ν being also an element of
R, this orbit closure meets Mm( ˜X0). We conclude that Γν is contained in Mm( ˜X).
In particular ν ∈ Mm( ˜X) ∩ M( ˜X0) = Mm( ˜X0) and we conclude that S ⊂ Mm( ˜X0),
whence the equality

(5.5)

Mm( ˜X0) = M( ˜X0).

5. Given a point ˜x ∈ ˜X0, the corresponding point mass δ˜x ∈ M( ˜X0) must have, by
(5.5), a preimage in Mm(X ∗∗
0 ). For ˜x with
(θ∗ ◦ θ∗
0 ) and therefore
ψ∗(δx∗∗) = δˆx ∈ Mm( ˆX0) with ˆx = ψ(x∗∗). By the deﬁnition of Mm( ˆX0) there exists
a measure ζ ∈ M(Z ∗

1)−1(˜x) = {x∗∗} a singleton, we must have ξ = δx∗∗ ∈ Mm(X ∗∗

1)(ξ) = δ˜x with ξ ∈ Mm(X ∗∗

0 ), say (θ∗ ◦ θ∗

0 ) with

δˆx = Λ(ζ) =

(cid:90)

Z∗

λz∗ dζ(z∗).

This clearly implies that the measure ζ is a point mass, say ζ = δz∗ and that the
measure λz∗ — which is the Haar measure on the homogeneous space which forms
the ﬁber ρ−1(z∗) ⊂ ˆX — is also a degenerate point mass. That is, the isometric
extension ρ is in fact an isomorphism. As we observed above, the collapse of ρ
implies the collapse of the entire AI tower for π, and the diagram (5.2) is obtained.

6. By Lemma 1.3 the section for π∗ has the form y∗ (cid:55)→ ν∗

y∗ = νθ(y∗) × δθ(y∗), whence
θ∗(ν∗
y∗) = νθ(y∗). Now the extension σ : Z → Y ∗, being isometric, admits a unique
section y∗ (cid:55)→ λy∗, where λy∗ is the Haar measure on the homogeneous space σ−1(y∗).
y∗) is the Haar measure λy∗ on the ﬁber σ−1(y∗).
It follows that ι(ν∗

From the construction of the O-shadow diagram it follows that the map

θ∗ : (π∗)−1(y∗) → π−1(y)

22

ELI GLASNER

(with y = θ(y∗)) is a homeomorphism. Therefore we can study the nature of the map
ι : ((π∗)−1(y∗), νy∗) → (σ−1(y∗), λy∗) via its pushforward

ι ◦ (θ∗)−1 : (π−1(y), νy) → (σ−1(y∗), λy∗).
Let vy∗ = y∗ for a minimal idempotent v. Then also vy = y and, ˜X being tame, we
have νy(v ˜X) = 1 by Lemma 4.2.2. We disintegrate ν∗

y∗ over λy∗

ν∗
y∗ =

(cid:90)

σ−1(y∗)

ξzd λy∗(z),

and correspondingly νy over λy, say

(cid:90)

νy =

ξωd λy(ω).

Now in the ﬁrst disintegration, for λy∗ almost every z, the measure ξz is concentrated
on ι−1(z), which consists of pairwise proximal points (ι being a proximal extension).
On the other hand, any two points in v ˜X are distal. We therefore conclude that for λy∗
almost every z, the measure ξω, and therefore also ξz, is a point mass. This means that
indeed ι : ((π∗)−1(y∗), νy∗) → (σ−1(y∗), λy∗) is a measure theoretical isomorphism.

Since the Haar measures section is unique we conclude that the section y∗ (cid:55)→ ν∗
y∗
(cid:3)

is unique. Finally, by Lemma 1.3, also y (cid:55)→ νy is unique.

2. If the system (X, Γ) admits an invariant probability measure µ then X is almost
it has the form X ι→ Z, where Z is equicontinuous and
automorphic, i.e.
ι is almost one-to-one. Moreover, µ is unique and the map ι is a measure
theoretical isomorphism ι : (X, µ, Γ) → (Z, λ, Γ), where λ is the Haar measure
on the homogeneous space Z.

3. Thus, when Γ is amenable this latter situation is the rule.

Concerning the ﬁrst assertion in Corollary 5.4 we pose the following.

5.5. Problem. Is a RIM homomorphism π : X → Y of minimal metric systems
necessarily open ? Is this true when, in addition, we assume that X is tame ?

5.6. Remark. In the situation described in Corollary 5.4.2, the set X0 = {x ∈ X :
ι−1(ι(x)) = {x}} is a dense Gδ and Γ-invariant subset of X and thus has µ measure
either zero or one.
In [28, Section 11] Kerr and Li construct a minimal Toeplitz
cascade (i.e. a Z-system) which is tame and not null. In [21, Remark 5.2] I claimed

(cid:127)
(cid:15)
(cid:15)
(cid:15)
(cid:15)
TAME MINIMAL DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

23

that this example can be made not regular in the sense that the densities of the
periodic parts converge to d < 1. As for such non-regular systems µ(X0) = 0, this
would show that the unique invariant measure of a minimal tame system need not be
supported by the set X0 where π is 1-1. Unfortunately the argument I had in mind
when claiming that the Kerr-Li example can be made nonregular was ﬂawed. Thus
the following basic question is still open.

5.7. Problem. Let (X, Γ) be a metric minimal tame system. Suppose that (X, Γ)
admits a (necessarily unique) invariant probability measure µ. Let X ι→ Z be its
maximal equicontinuous factor (so that ι is an almost one-to-one extension). Let
X0 ⊂ X be the dense Gδ subset of X deﬁned by X0 = {x ∈ X : ι−1(ι(x)) = {x}}. Is
it necessarily the case that µ(X0) = 1 ?

5.8. Remark. On the other hand, one may ask whether every metric minimal almost
automorphic system (X, Γ), with X ι→ Z being its maximal equicontinuous factor (so
that ι is an almost one-to-one extension), which admits a unique invariant measure µ
such that µ(X0) = 1, is necessarily tame ? The answer here is no. We can construct
a minimal subshift X ⊂ {0, 1}Z as above, with Z being an irrational rotation of the
circle, yet (X, σ) (σ denoting the shift) is not tame. We omit the details which will
be published elsewhere.

5.9. Remark. The following corollary of Theorem 5.3 was suggested by the ref-
eree. The notion of mean equicontinuity was studied in [30] and [7]. (A Z-system is
mean equicontinuous if for every (cid:15) > 0 there is δ > 0 such that if d(x, y) < δ then
d(T ix, T iy) < (cid:15) for all i except for a set of density < (cid:15).) Combining Theorem 2.1 of
[7] and Theorem 5.3 we deduce the following:
5.10. Corollary. A minimal tame Z-system is mean equicontinuous.

6. Examples

We illustrate our main theorem, Theorem 5.3, with some basic examples.

• The classical Sturmian Z dynamical system (X, T ) (where T : X → X is the
homeomorphism which generate the Z action) is minimal and tame. This is
an almost automorphic system with θ : X → Z, an almost one-to-one factor,
the projection of X onto its largest equicontinuous factor Z, the dyadic adding
machine. See [22].

• Every null dynamical system is tame; see [27] and [28].

(A system is null
if it has zero sequence topological entropy with respect to every subsequence
ni (cid:37) ∞.)

• The action of G = GL(d, R) (and hence of any subsgroup Γ < G) on the
projective space Pd−1, comprising the lines through the origin in Rn, is tame
(see the appendix below). The same is true for the action of G on Sd−1,
identiﬁed with the space of rays emanating from the origin. We have a natural
two-to-one map σ : Sd−1 → Pd−1. This factor map corresponds to the diagram
(5.6) with X = ˜X = Z = Sd and Y = Pd−1. See [14], [9] and [1].

• The action of the group G = Homeo (S1) (and hence of any subsgroup Γ < G)

on the circle S1 is tame. See [24].

24

ELI GLASNER

• Our next example will demonstrate the necessity for the presence of the exten-
sion η in the diagram (5.6). It is an elaboration of an example of Furstenberg
and Glasner, see [18]. Let G be the closed subgroup of the Lie group GL(4, R)
consisting of all 4 × 4 matrices of the form

(cid:19)

(cid:18)A 0
0 B

and

(cid:19)

(cid:18) 0 A
B 0,

with A, B ∈ GL(2, R). We let G act on the subspace X of the projective space
P3 consisting of the disjoint union of the two one dimensional projective spaces
P1, which are naturally embedded in P3, the quotient space of R4 = R2 × R2.
Call these two copies X1 and X2 respectively. By [1] this action is tame.

There is a natural projection from (X, G) onto the two points G-system
({X1, X2}, G). It is now easy to establish the remaining assertions of the fol-
lowing:

Claim 1: The G-system (X, G) is minimal and tame. It admits the isometric
factor which is the “ﬂip” on two points and the map from X onto ({X1, X2}, G)
is a strongly proximal extension. However, the system (X, G) admits no non-
trivial proximal factor.

Let Y be the “quasifactor” of (X, G) deﬁned by:

Y = {

1
2

(δx1 + δx2) : xi ∈ Xi, i = 1, 2} ⊂ M(X).

Again it is easy to check that the system (Y, G) is minimal and strongly prox-
imal G-system.
Next let

˜X = {(xi,

1
2

(δx1 + δx2)) : xi ∈ Xi, i = 1, 2} ⊂ X × M(X).

Claim 2: ˜X is minimal and tame. Let η : ˜X → X and σ : ˜X → Y denote
the projections from ˆX onto its two components. Then the diagram (5.6) (with
Z = ˜X and ι the identity map) is the canonical standard extension describing
the structure of the minimal tame system X.

In this short section we will rewrite Furstenberg’s proof of Borel’s density theorem

[14], in terms of tame systems and enveloping semigroups.

As we will show next the action of G = SLd(R) on the projective space Pd−1
(d ≥ 2) is tame. This is also true for the G action on Sd−1.
In both cases the
enveloping semigroup is a Rosenthal compactum but not metrizable. In the case of
the projective space it is not even ﬁrst countable (see [1]). Thus, these systems are
tame but not HAE.

For a non-zero vector v ∈ Rd we let v denote its image in Pd−1. Similarly, for g ∈ G

we let g denote its image in E(Pd−1, SLd(R)).

7.1. Lemma. The action of GLd(R) on Pd−1 is tame.

Proof. Let gn be a sequence of matrices in GLd(R). Given any subspace W ⊂ Rd,
by passing to a subsequence and by choosing appropriate scalars λn, we can assume
that λngn → hW , a non-zero linear map from W into Rd. For v (cid:54)∈ ker(hW ) we have
λngn(v) → hW (v).

Now deﬁne W0 = Rd, W1 = ker(hW0), and repeat this procedure with W1 to obtain
hW1 which maps W1 onto a subspace of Rd. Proceeding by induction (till we have a
trivial kernel) we ﬁnally obtain a subsequence such that gni → p ∈ E(Pd−1, SLd(R)).
(cid:3)
This shows that (Pd−1, G) is tame.

Note that for W = Rd the assumptions gn ∈ SLd(R) and (cid:107)gn(cid:107) → ∞, imply that
dim ker hW ≥ 1. Thus, in this case the image of p is a ﬁnite union of projective
sub-verieties of dimension < d − 1 (a quasi-sub-veriety).

7.2. Deﬁnition. A pair of groups (G, H) is called a Borel pair if G is a minimally
almost periodic (m.a.p.) group and H is a closed subgroup of G such that the quotient
space G/H supports a ﬁnite G-invariant measure.

7.3. Theorem (Borel’s density theorem). Let (G, H) be a Borel pair and π a ﬁnite-
dimensional representation of G on a space V . If W is a π(H)-invariant subspace, it
is also π(G)-invariant.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that dim(W ) = 1, say W = Rv, so that x0 = v ∈ P(V ). Then,
the map g (cid:55)→ gv = gx0, from G/H into P(V ), sends the invariant measure on G/H
to an invariant measure, say µ, on P(V ). Let Y be the support of µ. Clearly x0 ∈ Y
and Y is a closed G-invariant subset. Let u ∈ E(P(V ), G) be a minimal idempotent.
Then (by tameness; see Theorem 4.1) u∗µ = µ and it follows that µ(uP(V )) = 1.
By tameness there is a sequence gn ∈ G with gn → u. The range of u can not be
all of P(V ) since this would mean that the enveloping semigroup is actually a group
and therefore, that the action is distal; however, this possibility is ruled out by the
m.a.p. property of G. Thus, the set uP(V ) is a quasi-sub-veriety (ﬁnite union of
proper sub-varieties). In particular it is closed, whence Y ⊂ uP(V ).

Let L = (cid:83) Li be a minimal projective quasi-sub-variety containing Y . Then L is
closed and G-invariant and G must permute its components. By m.a.p. the permu-
tations are all the identity permutations. Thus each Li is G-invariant.

If the G-action on Li is not trivial then, again we conclude that uLi (cid:40) Li, which
contradicts the minimality of L. Thus G acts on L as the identity and, in particular,
x0 ∈ Y ⊂ L is a G-ﬁxed point.

The general case is reduced to the 1-dimensional one using exterior products. (cid:3)

We refer the reader to [3] and [14] where it is shown how from this theorem one

easily deduces the remaining results of [3].
