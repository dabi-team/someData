ABSTRACT

We apply a novel pre-ﬂare tracking of sunspot groups towards improving the estima-
tion of ﬂare onset time by focusing on the evolution of the 3D magnetic ﬁeld construc-
tion of AR 11429. The 3D magnetic structure is based on potential ﬁeld extrapolation
encompassing a vertical range from the photosphere through the chromosphere and
transition region into the low corona. The basis of our proxy measure of activity pre-
diction is the so-called weighted horizontal gradient of magnetic ﬁeld (W GM ) deﬁned
between spots of opposite polarities close to the polarity inversion line of an active
region. The temporal variation of the distance of the barycenter of the opposite po-
larities is also found to possess potentially important diagnostic information about the
ﬂare onset time estimation as function of height similar to its counterpart introduced
initially in an application at the photosphere only in Korsos et al. (2015). We apply
the photospheric pre-ﬂare behavioural patterns of sunspot groups to the evolution of
their associated 3D-constructed AR 11429 as function of height. We found that at a
certain height in the lower solar atmosphere the onset time may be estimated much
earlier than at the photosphere or at any other heights. Therefore, we present a tool
and recipe that may potentially identify the optimum height for ﬂare prognostic in the
solar atmosphere allowing to improve our ﬂare prediction capability and capacity.

Introduction

The 3D magnetic ﬁeld structure of an AR is a key to obtain a more accurate information about
the pre-ﬂare evolution of a ﬂaring AR. However, to construct an accurate 3D magnetic skeleton of
an AR is a challenging task, see e.g. Wiegelmann & Sakurai (2012). To accomplish this, one may
need to measure the magnetic ﬁeld at a number of heights. However, even nowadays, there are
no routinely carried out direct measurements of the solar magnetic ﬁeld in the solar atmosphere
except only at the photosphere, see e.g. the magnetic ﬁeld observations by SDO/HMI. Measuring
routinely the magnetic ﬁeld higher up in the solar atmosphere proved to be far too challenging
because of a number of technical reasons, see e.g. Solanki et al.
(2003) and the follow-up debate
by Judge (2009). Therefore, we may need to develop other complementary theoretical tools, that
capture the key features of the 3D magnetic structure of an AR in the (lower) solar atmosphere. A
frequently used such tool is magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation based on photospheric measurements, see
e.g. Wiegelmann & Sakurai (2012). The method employs the approximation that the solar corona
is considered to be in low-β plasma state, or in other words, the magnetic pressure dominates over
the pressure in the plasma. From this, we may approximate the plasma being in force-free (FF)
state satisfying

j × B = 0.

(1)

Here, j = 1
µ0

▽ × B is the electric current density, B the magnetic ﬁeld and µ0 is the magnetic
permeability of free space. This approximation may be a good one for describing the state of the
coronal magnetic ﬁeld. However, many studies claim (for good reasons) that the FF approximation
is not reliable below the transition region, especially in the photosphere. Equation (1) can be
satisﬁed by j = ▽ × B = 0, where the current density vanishes everywhere. This is called a
potential ﬁeld (PF). Another option is when j || B, that can be rewritten as ▽ × B = α ~B and
B · ▽α = 0, where α is the FF parameter. When α is constant along B everywhere in a given
volume, it is the linear FF ﬁeld (LFFF) approximation, otherwise α may be a spatially dependent
scalar function, in which case we have the nonlinear FF ﬁeld (NLFFF) approximation.

It is elementary to understand the ﬂare occurrence as the removal of free (i.e. non-potential)
energy and helicity emerging through the Sun’s surface, that is why the LFFF and NLFFF are more
realistic (though not necessarily more pragmatic!) approximations than the PF extrapolation.
Nevertheless, as a ﬁrst step of our study, we use the PF extrapolation not only because of its
mathematical simplicity but also to provide a ﬁrst coarser view on how ﬂare forecasting may be
aﬀected by tracking magnetic ﬁeld structures in such 3D models of an AR in the lower solar
atmosphere. Now, we only will investigate the typical pre-ﬂare behaviour patterns as a function of
height in the lower solar atmosphere.

2. Analysis

Kors´os et al. (2015), hereafter K15, introduced a new parameter that may more accurately
characterise the pre-ﬂare evolution of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld of ARs. This is the weighted
horizontal gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld (W GM ) between nearby groups of spots of opposite mag-
netic polarities closest to the polarity inversion line. With an empirical analyses, for all the observed
ﬂare cases between 1996-2010 that satisfy certain selection criteria (for that see K15), they discov-
ered two typical pre-ﬂare patterns for higher than M5 GOES ﬂare-classes: (i) The pre-ﬂare behavior
of the W GM itself exhibits characteristic and unique patterns: steep rise, high maximum and a
gradual decrease prior to ﬂaring. (ii) There is a U-shaped typical pre-ﬂare pattern during the com-
pressing and diverging motion in the distance value of the area-weighted barycenters of opposite
polarities preceding the ﬂare onset. Also, K15 found, surprisingly, that if any one of these two
typical pre-ﬂare behaviours is missing then no ﬂare occurs.

Based on the empirical study of K15, a further tool was developed for estimating the ﬂare
onset time: if one can identify the time when the distance between the two barycentres of the area-
weighted opposite polarities begins to grow again after the compression phase of the evolution,
then one may be able to estimate the onset time of the ﬂare by Eq.
(3) of K15. With the
aim to improve the eﬃciency of the onset time estimation capability of the W GM method that
is based on the observed photospheric dynamics of pre-ﬂare, we now propose to investigate the
two pre-ﬂare signatures not only at the photosphere but higher up in the lower solar atmosphere,
in the Interface Region and low corona in a 3D-constructed magnetic structure for an AR.
i.e.
Implementing SDO/HMI line of sight magnetogram (and imaging) observations in the construction
of the magnetic mapping of ARs may be a fruitful task. This procedure may also be cumbersome
and computationally very expensive. Based on the W GM method, we test now the feasibility of
estimating the ﬂare onset time on the magnetic mapping of AR 11429 using one of the simplest 3D
magnetic constructions, namelly the PF exploration (see Fig. 2a). This way, if it works and applied
routinely, a new data catalogue may be established, for further analysis. This catalogue which is
based on the 3D magnetic data would contain valuable information on position, area and magnetic
ﬁeld/ﬂux for each sunspot across the lower solar atmosphere.

In order to test the concept, here, let us now apply the W GM method and track the temporal
variation of W GM , distance of the area-weighted barycentre of the opposite polarities and the net
ﬂux at various heights for pre-ﬂare dynamic studies for AR 11429 which produced one X5.4 (on
2012-03-07 00:24) and two M-class ﬂares (M6.3 and M8.4 ﬂares on 2012-03-09 03:53 and 2012-03-10
17:44). The investigation of the pre-ﬂare dynamics is applied to the 3D construction of the AR
between 6-12 March. Note, we cannot investigate the X5.4 ﬂare because the limits of the W GM
method (e.g. the X5.4 ﬂare occurred close to the East limb).

In the ﬁrst step, as one ascends with a step-size of 100 km higher in the solar atmosphere and
reaches the level of 2 Mm above the photosphere, following the application of the W GM method
detailed in K15, we now recognise at most of the heights the prominent typical pre-ﬂare behavior of

– 4 –

the W GM (the increasing, maximum and after the decreasing phase of W GM ), and, the distance
(evolving during the full converging-diverging motion of area-weighted barycenters) prior to ﬂare(s).
Furthermore, we also ﬁnd that the evolution of W GM and distance changes remarkably as function
of height (see Fig. 1a-c).

In short, as we reach ∼0.4-0.6 Mm heights in the solar atmosphere, we see the beginning of

the converging-diverging motion of the distance starts earlier than at the photospheric level.

3. Result

While applying the W GM method to the PF extrapolated structure of AR 11429 we notice
that the starting time of the approaching phase changes as function of height, as visualized in
Fig. 2. Here, we plot the start of the converging phase (red lines) and the moment of time of the
minimum distance of barycentres (blue lines) as function of height. We notice that in the case
of the M6.3 ﬂare at about 0.4 Mm level, and, in the case of M8.4 ﬂare at about 0.6 Mm, the
converging phase starts much earlier and reaches the minimum point also earlier than it does at
the photosphere or at other heights. From this behaviour we may conclude that the ﬂare onset
times (by using the empirical Eq. 3 from K15 or otherwise) could be estimated sooner at certain
heights than at photosphere or in the corona. In summary, identifying this optimum height in the
solar atmosphere for a given AR may increase the time window elapsing prior to a ﬂare. If this
conclusion is conﬁrmed by using a larger, statistically signiﬁcant sample of ARs containing ﬂare
eruptions this would be a signiﬁcant progress.
