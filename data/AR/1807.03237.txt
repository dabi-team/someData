Magnetic Flux Cancelation as the Buildup and Trigger
Mechanism for CME-Producing Eruptions in two Small Active
Regions

Alphonse C. Sterling1, Ronald L. Moore1,2, Navdeep K. Panesar1

ABSTRACT

We follow two small, magnetically isolated CME-producing solar active re-
gions (ARs) from the time of their emergence until several days later, when their
core regions erupt to produce the CMEs. In both cases, magnetograms show:
(a) following an initial period where the poles of the emerging regions separate
from each other, the poles then reverse direction and start to retract inward; (b)
during the retraction period, ﬂux cancelation occurs along the main neutral line
of the regions; (c) this cancelation builds the sheared core ﬁeld/ﬂux rope that
eventually erupts to make the CME. In the two cases, respectively 30% and 50%
of the maximum ﬂux of the region cancels prior to the eruption. Recent stud-
ies indicate that solar coronal jets frequently result from small-scale ﬁlaments
eruptions, with those “miniﬁlament” eruptions also being built up and triggered
by cancelation of magnetic ﬂux. Together, the small-AR eruptions here and the
coronal jet results suggest that isolated bipolar regions tend to erupt when some
threshold fraction, perhaps in the range of 50%, of the region’s maximum ﬂux
has canceled. Our observed erupting ﬁlaments/ﬂux ropes form at sites of ﬂux
cancelation, in agreement with previous observations. Thus, the recent ﬁnding
that miniﬁlaments that erupt to form jets also form via ﬂux cancelation is further
evidence that miniﬁlaments are small-scale versions of the long-studied full-sized
ﬁlaments.

Introduction

Large-scale solar eruptions that produce solar ﬂares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and
other phenomena often start with the eruption of a ﬁlament structure of size 3 × 104—1.1 ×
105 km Bernasconi et al. (2005). What builds these ﬁlaments, and what eventually triggers
them to undergo violent eruption, are long-standing questions. Because ﬁlaments form in
magnetic ﬁeld that runs along a magnetic neutral line, it is clear that magnetic free energy, i.e.
energy in the ﬁeld in excess of that of a potential conﬁguration, is a requirement. Magnetic
ﬂux cancelation at the neutral line has been observed to precede ﬁlament formation (Martin
1986), and van Ballegooijen & Martens (1989) developed a theoretical picture explaining
how such cancelation can result in a ﬁlament.

Among the questions that remain is: what are the speciﬁc circumstances that determine
when the ﬁlament will erupt to produce a ﬂare and, if ejective, a CME? It is a challenge
to address this question with large-scale eruptions for the following reason: CME-producing
ﬁlament eruptions often occur in active regions (ARs) that emerge and grow to a substantial
size before eruption takes place; apparently, frequently the ﬁeld must ﬁrst evolve over some
time after the region emerges, and so it can take two weeks or more for the AR to mature and
generate a strong solar eruption. Therefore, because a complete solar rotation is ∼27 days,
it is often not possible to observe the same ﬂare-producing AR on the Sun from the time
that AR is born until the time of eruption. That is, the AR in which a large-scale eruption
visible from Earth occurs usually was born when that region was on the far side of the Sun,
if not even earlier. This means that it is frequently not possible to follow in its entirety
the magnetic buildup of a large-scale solar eruption with a set of near-Earth instruments.
This makes it diﬃcult to observe the entire history leading up to the eruption, and so our
understanding of the eruption’s buildup is frequently limited in scope. And, because the
time-scale for buildup to eruption is comparatively long, it can be diﬃcult to separate out
the key aspects that are most important for understanding eruption onset. That is, if a
strong-ﬂare-producing AR develops on the far side of the Sun, we could miss key magnetic
changes leading to an eruption in the AR when it is on the near side. Sorting out which
magnetic changes are key to an eruption are made more diﬃcult in such cases.

It therefore would be advantageous if there were short-lived small magnetic active regions
that we could study in their entirety during their disk passage, and over a short-enough period
so that the chance of complicating other substantial magnetic ﬂux changes occurring during
the build-up to a whole-region-scale eruption would be minimized. One such category of such
small active solar magnetic regions are those whose whole-region-scale eruptions make solar
coronal jets. Sterling et al. (2015) present evidence that these jets are small-scale versions of
larger-scale eruptions (for a similar view, see, e.g., Hong et al. 2011, 2014; Shen et al. 2011;

– 3 –

Innes & Teriaca 2013), implying that lessons from jet-producing regions can inform us about
larger-scale-eruption buildup and triggering.

Seen in X-rays with Hinode/XRT, coronal jets are long (reaching ∼50,000 km), nar-
row (∼8,000 km), transient (lifetime ∼10 min) features that shoot into the corona at a
rate of ∼60/day in polar coronal holes (Cirtain et al. 2007; Savcheva et al. 2007), and a “jet
bright point” (JBP) forms at an edge of the base of the jet. Coronal jets are also visible
in EUV coronal images (e.g. Raouaﬁ et al. 2008; Nistic`o 2009), and they are prevalent in
quiet Sun and ARs in addition to coronal holes (e.g. Shimojo et al. 1996; Raouaﬁ et al.
2016; Panesar et al. 2017, 2018; Sterling et al. 2017; Hong et al. 2016, 2017). Figure 1
shows a schematic picture for jet production presented by Sterling et al. (2015), based
on the idea that eruption of a small-scale ﬁlament, or “miniﬁlament,” is the source of
the jets. This ﬁgure is modiﬁed slightly from earlier versions (Sterling et al. 2015, 2016,
2017) with the addition of the red, dashed reconnected ﬁeld lines in panel (b), motivated
by a recent study of Moore, Sterling, & Panesar (2018) demonstrating that reconnection
at the magnetic null point in the corona often begins earlier than or concurrent with
the tether-cutting reconnection below the rising miniﬁlament. This miniﬁlament eruption
model for jets has recently been successfully simulated (Wyper, Antiochos, & DeVore 2017;
Wyper, DeVore, & Antiochos 2018).

Based on recent observations, it is now clear that at least many coronal jets are small-
scale versions of large-scale eruptions (e.g. Shen et al. 2012a; Adams et al. 2014; Sterling et al.
2015, 2016, 2017; Panesar et al. 2016a,b, 2017, 2018). Seen in proﬁle at the solar limb, the
miniﬁlaments that erupt to cause the jets are of a much smaller size (∼8000 km) but other-
wise appear to be similar to “normal”-sized ﬁlaments.

There are direct analogies between the coronal jets, and the the large-scale magnetic
eruptions that make ﬂares and CMEs: coronal jets result from eruptions of miniﬁlaments,
generate a miniature ﬂare (the JBP), and eject material onto open ﬁeld lines that guide
the jet (analogous to the CME in many large-scale eruptions) (Sterling et al. 2015). Besides
physical size, another diﬀerence between larger-scale eruptions and the eruptions that make
jets is that the buildup to eruption is much shorter with the jets: Panesar et al. (2017) found
that, for ten solar quiet region jets, the miniﬁlaments that erupt to make jets evolve from
birth to eruption over periods ranging from 1.5 hr to two days, and thus much shorter than
the two weeks or more for the ARs hosting large-scale eruptions to evolve and release an
explosive eruption.

Because the erupting miniﬁlaments are analogous to the erupting larger-scale ﬁlaments,
we suspect that the mechanism building and triggering the miniﬁlaments to erupt is the
same, except for size scale (and magnitude), as the buildup and triggering mechanism for

– 4 –

large-scale eruptions. Miniﬁlaments that erupt to form jets evolve rapidly enough so that
we can investigate directly the magnetic ﬂux changes leading to their eruption. Over several
investigations (§2) we have now measured magnetic-change quantities of the ﬁelds at the base
of a number of jets. The object of the current study is to examine the magnetic properties
of a CME-producing region that is larger scale than those that produce jets, for comparison
with the situation in jets. Our selected erupting region however is small enough so that we
can observe the region from the time of that ﬁeld’s emergence through the time of eruption.
This allows us to measure in this CME-producing eruption the same magnetic quantities
that we measured in the jets.

2. Magnetic Cancelation in Jets

We have previously studied the properties of the ﬂux cancelations around the time of
jet onset. Panesar et al. (2016b, 2017) examined 10-15 quiet-region jets (the actual number
studied depends on how one counts repeated, a.k.a. homologous, jets); and Panesar et al.
(2018) studied 13 coronal hole jets. All of the quiet region and coronal hole jets either showed
clear ﬂux cancelation at about the time of the jet onset, or (in a minority of cases) the situa-
tion was ambiguous but still consistent with cancelation. In the AR-jet cases (Sterling et al.
2016, 2017), in only one (out of ≈17 in total) jet episode (in Sterling et al. 2016) was it
unclear whether cancelation was occurring at the jet location near the time of jet onset; in
all other cases, cancelation was clearly present at the base of the jets at the time the jets
were occurring.

For the nine quiet region jets where reliable measurements were possible, Panesar et al.
(2016b) found that, between a time substantially before the jet (5—6 hrs) and soon after
the jet (0—1 hrs), the percentage of minority-ﬂux reduction ranged between 18%—57%.
From the reduction percentage for each jet (which we call pi) and their corresponding stan-
dard deviations (σi) listed in Table 1 of Panesar et al. (2016b), we can calculate a weighted
mean, P , and weighted standard deviation, σP , for the percent reduction in ﬂux for each of
those quiet region jets. Using 1/σ2
i as weighting factors, we use for these quantities (e.g.,
Bevington & Robinson 2003):

where N is the number of jets examined. This gives a weighted mean and weighted stan-
dard deviation of 36.6%±12.8% for the nine quiet Sun jets. Also, for these quiet Sun jets
Panesar et al. (2016b) found the minority ﬂux patches generally to be of order ∼1019 Mx.

In a similar fashion, for coronal hole jets Panesar et al. (2018) found ﬂux reductions
for 11 jets to range between 21%—73%. Applying (1) and (2) to the values in Table 1 of
Panesar et al. (2018) gives weighted average and weighted standard deviation of 44.8%±15.8%.
For these coronal hole jets, Panesar et al. (2018) found the minority ﬂux patches again gen-
erally to be of order ∼1019 Mx, and they also calculated an average cancelation rate of
∼0.6×1018 Mx/hr.

For approximately seven AR jets, Sterling et al. (2017) found on average ∼5×1018 Mx
canceled prior to each jet episode, that the ﬂux cancelation occurred at a rate of ∼1.5×1019 Mx/hr,
and estimated that ∼1028—∼1029 ergs of free magnetic energy built up per jet. Due to the
dynamic nature and polarity-arrangement complexity of the region however, it was not as
straightforward as in the quiet Sun and coronal hole cases to measure the percentage of ﬂux
change in the buildups to the jets in the Sterling et al. (2017) study. We summarize various
coronal jet properties in Table 1.

Several other detailed investigations of one or a small number of jets also found them to
originate from locations where magnetic ﬂux cancelation occurs (Hong et al. 2011; Shen et al.
2012a; Huang et al. 2012; Adams et al. 2014; Young & Muglach 2014a,b; Shen et al. 2017).
Some other jets however apparently occur in the absence of obvious ﬂux cancelation at the
HMI-detectable level (Kumar et al. 2018), although a study of 20 jets by Mulay et al. (2016)
also supports that most jets do occur at sites that include obvious ﬂux cancelation.

Here we will study two CME-producing ARs for which we can track the entire magnetic
history of the regions, from time of emergence until the time of the CME-producing eruptions.

3.

Instrumentation and Data

For this study we use data from two instruments on the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). That satellite’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) images the
Sun in seven EUV wavelength bands: 304 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 131 ˚A, 94 ˚A, 335 ˚A, in

– 6 –

two UV bands: 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A, and in a visible band: 4500 ˚A. These channels respond
to plasmas emitting over a wide range of temperatures in the solar atmosphere (Lemen et al.
2012), observing the full disk with 0′′.6 pixels and typically with cadence of 12 s and 24 s in
the EUV and UV channels respectively. Our magnetic data are from full-disk line-of-sight
magnetograms from SDO’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012),
with 45 s cadence and 0′′.5 pixels.

For this study we searched for ARs that (a) erupt to produce a CME, (b) that we
can follow on the solar disk from emergence until the time of eruption within a single disk
passage, and (c) that remain well isolated from other magnetic ﬂux emergence until the
time of eruption. Additionally, because we want to track the region as it builds up the free
energy in the ﬁeld that eventually erupts, we avoided regions that emerge already containing
substantial free energy concentrated in their cores and can explosively erupt shortly after
emergence, such as is the case with some delta-sunspot ARs.

For our two selected regions, because of the short development time necessitated by
condition (b), in both cases the emerged AR is small and the resulting CME-producing
eruptions are correspondingly small. Our ﬁrst example makes a CME-producing eruption
with a GOES C-class ﬂare of 2013 October 20 from AR 11868. This region had small
sunspots visible on October 18. Also, it had two ﬁlament/ﬂux ropes, one along the region’s
main neutral line that was faint in EUV, and a second one along a neutral line on the outside
edge of the region; as we will discuss below, both ﬁlaments erupted in this region’s eruption
episode. The second active region that we study produced a B-class ﬂare on 2010 July 16
from AR 11088; this region had a small sunspot from early in its life that decayed over
the course of our observations. This second region also had a ﬁlament prominent in EUV
running along its main neutral line, and this ﬁlament erupted during the eruption episode.

In both cases the resulting CMEs had widths smaller than many larger eruptions (as
discussed below). On the other hand, in both cases the erupting ﬁlaments had 2-D projected
spans (i.e., not considering inclination angle on the disk or curvature of the ﬁlament) of ∼70′′;
this is substantially longer than the ∼8000 km (∼11′′) for miniﬁlaments measured in polar
coronal hole jets by Sterling et al. (2015), or the jet-base widths for on-disk jets in coronal
holes (∼12,000 km)(∼17′′) of Panesar et al. (2018) and in quiet regions (∼17,000 km)(∼23′′)
of Panesar et al. (2016b). Therefore, we are observing eruptions of a larger category than
those producing typical coronal jets.

4. Eruption of 2013 October 20

4.1. EUV Development

Figure 2 shows the eruption of 2013 October 20 in AIA 131 and AIA 304 ˚A images at
various times, with Figures 2(d) and 2(h) showing overlaid HMI magnetograms. In describing
this eruption, we will also point out similarities with coronal jets.

Figures 2(a)—2(c) show that one of the two ﬂux rope/ﬁlaments of this region erupts
out from the main neutral line (Fig. 2(d)), where that neutral line is apparent in the mag-
netograms of Figures 2(d) and 2(h). This ﬂux rope/ﬁlament is not very prominent in EUV;
while visible in all seven AIA EUV channels, it is perhaps most obvious in the close-up 304 ˚A
images of Figures 2(a)—2(c). (At times leading up to eruption, this ﬁlament is prominent
in GONG Hα images, available at gong.nso.edu. Discussion of these images however is out-
side the focus of the current paper.) The main ﬂare brightening of the eruption occurs on
the same main, strong magnetic neutral line (Figs. 2(d) and 2(e)). Comparing with the jet
picture, this main neutral line corresponds to the neutral line deﬁned by polarities M2 and
M3 in Figure 1(a), where the JBP develops in Figures 1(b) and 1(c)).

Away from that core location where the main brightening occurs, there is a bright rim
that partially surrounds the core erupting region; arrows in Figure 2(e) point out these remote
brightenings, which are also seen in some ejective ﬂares (e.g. Masson et al. 2009; Sun et al.
2012; Joshi et al. 2015); Joshi et al. (2017) have argued that “three-ribbon ﬂare” events such
as this are closely analogous to jets. Circular ribbons such as these, sometimes seen as only a
portion of circles, are common in coronal jets (e.g., li et al. 2017, 2018; Panesar et al. 2016b,
Fig. 1b), and also in chromospheric jets known as surges (see discussion in Sterling et al. 2016,
§4). Comparing these circular brightenings with magnetograms (Fig. 2(h); also see Fig. 5(a)),
it is obvious that they are lodged against the edge of dominant-polarity (negative in this case)
ﬁeld. This agrees with the jet picture in Figure 1, where the circular ribbon is mapped out
by the negative-polarity footpoint of the dashed-line reconnection loop in Figure 1(b). For
the eruption in Figure 2, the loops in the large-scale event corresponding to the Figure 1(b)
dashed loop itself are visible in the AIA 131 ˚A video corresponding to Figure 2 (many such
loops are obvious at, e.g., 09:23:44 UT in that video).

Our particular event in Figure 2 however is more complicated than the basic jet picture
of Figure 1. In the core region, where the ﬂare starts to brighten from about 08:32 UT in
the video accompanying Figure 2, as noted above, in EUV images a well-developed ﬁlament
does not form and the ﬂux rope that erupts is faint (Figs. 2(a)—2(c)). There is, on the other
hand, a large ﬁlament that forms at and erupts from a location in-between the core (where
the bright ﬂare is occurring in Fig. 2(b)) and the remote brightenings marked by the arrows

– 8 –

in Figure 2(e). This ﬁlament begins to erupt at about 08:44 UT on 2013 October 20, which
is after the core eruption starts at about 08:34 UT. We discuss this ﬁlament eruption further
in §4.3.

Figure 3 and the accompanying video show that this region’s eruption produced a
CME, visible in SOHO/LASCO/C2 running-diﬀerence images (obtained from the online
SOHO/LASCO CME catalog; Gopalswamy et al. 2009), ﬁrst visible oﬀ of the solar west
limb at 09:12 UT, and eventually having width ∼60◦. From the movie we estimate its speed
to be ∼400 km s−1. We suspect that the CME has components from the eruption of the
core-region ﬂux rope, as well as from the eruption of the prominent ﬁlament, with both
eruptions visible in the videos accompanying Figure 2. It is not however possible to say with
certainty whether one or the other of the eruptions, or both together, contributed most to
the visible CME.

4.2. Magnetic Field Evolution

From HMI magnetograms, AR 11868, from which the 2013 October 20 eruption oc-
curred, started emerging at about 14:00 UT on 2013 October 15. It underwent a surge in
emergence from about 04:00 UT on October 16, and an even stronger surge from about
02:30 UT on October 18. When it started emerging on October 15 it was about 400′′ east
of central meridian, and at the time of eruption near 08:40 UT on October 20 it is 500′′
west of central meridian. Therefore it is an ideal example of a small bipolar AR with a
relatively short evolution period of about ﬁve days, before producing an eruption. Moreover,
the eruption was substantially larger (in both geometric size and EUV ﬂux) than a coronal
jet, and also drove a CME of modest width.

Figure 4 shows the evolution of the magnetic region, where we have rotated all of the
images to a common time of 09:00 UT on 2013 October 20, and so close to the eruption
time; all of the other presented solar images and movies for this event are rotated to this
same time. In the images of Figure 4 we only show the region from after the start of the
strongest surge in emergence, while the movie accompanying that ﬁgure shows the region’s
evolution over the entire time period, beginning before its emergence on October 14.

From Figure 4 and the accompanying movie, we see that the two polarities of the region
ﬁrst separate from each other, and that separating motion continues until around 03:00 UT
on October 19. But then the two polarities start to converge upon themselves. As that
convergence continues, the two poles of the bipole region start to interact and cancel, from
about 03:00 UT on October 20, and this convergence and cancelation continues through the

– 9 –

time of the eruption near 08:40 UT on October 20.

Figure 5 is a diﬀerent representation of this dynamical evolution over the time span
covered by Figure 4, that is, from the start of the ﬁnal burst of ﬂux emergence thorough to
the time of the eruption. This is a time-distance map of that evolution, with the ordinate
values representing horizontal integrations across the region covered by the white box in
Figure 4(a), plotted as a function of time; the vertical axis in Figure 5 therefore represents
distance along the y-direction in the panels of Figure 4. This clearly shows the two ﬂux
polarities separating early during the period, and then converging at later times, with the
eruption occurring near the time when strong patches of the opposite polarities collide.

Figure 6 shows the time evolution of the positive ﬂux of the region, integrated over the
area of the white box in Figure 4(a). Although the HMI magnetograms that we are using only
provide the line-of-sight component, we have approximately accounted for foreshortening in
the Earth-directed projection of that component by dividing by the cosine of the heliocentric
angle between the AR’s location and disk center (as observed by HMI), as a function of time.
(When using non-derotated magnetograms, there is an additional cosine factor required
to correct for foreshortening of the area used in the ﬂux calculation, meaning that one
should divide by cosine squared instead of cosine. Correction to this area factor however
was accounted for with the derotation procedure that we used, which was the solarsoft
(Freeland & Handy 1998) routine “drot map,” and therefore here we only need to divide by
cosine to the ﬁrst power.) We only measure the positive-polarity ﬂux because it can be well
isolated within the box over the entire duration of the measurement shown in Figure 6. In
contrast, the negative ﬂux has obvious ﬂows across the Figure 4(a)-box boundary, and hence
cannot be measured reliably over that region. Our plot in Figure 6 covers the entire period
from the beginning of the ﬂux emergence, showing the weak initial emergence near 14:00 UT
on October 15, and then the two subsequent surges in emergence. This shows that when
eruption occurs (orange line), the cancelation has been going on for some time.

Using the best-ﬁt green line in the Figure 6 plot, we estimate the rate of ﬂux cancelation
to be 1.1×1019 Mx/hr over the full time period of the green line (30.75 hr; see Fig. 6 caption).
If however we instead consider that the true fall-oﬀ commences with the bump in ﬂux near
18:00 UT on October 19, then the rate increases to ∼1.5×1019 Mx/hr. Therefore we take
the rate of ﬂux decrease to be ∼(1.3±0.2) × 1019 Mx/hr. If we assume that this canceled
ﬂux builds a magnetic ﬂux rope, and assuming equal amounts of positive and negative ﬂux
cancel, this implies ∼3.9×1020 Mx of ﬂux builds up in the ﬂux rope over a 30-hr period prior
to the eruption. (The arguments are essentially unchanged if, instead of a ﬂux rope, the
cancelation goes into accumulation of non-potential shear along the neutral line.) From the
plot in Figure 6 we see that ∼30% of the peak ﬂux value canceled prior to the time of the

– 10 –

eruption.

We can estimate the amount of free energy contained in, say, the ﬂux rope, formed
by the canceled ﬁeld. We can estimate the magnetic ﬁeld strength, B, of the ﬂux rope,
assuming that the total accumulated ﬂux passes through the approximate length-wise cross-
sectional area, A, of the ﬂux rope. We estimate the size of the neutral line over which the
cancelation occurs to be ∼50′′, based on the length of the abutting positive and negative
ﬂuxes in Figure 4(d)—4(f). Also, from Figure 4(f) we estimate, from the separation of
the two abutting polarities, that the width of the ﬂux rope might be roughly 5′′; this is
about the separation distance between the positive and negative ﬂux patches in Figures 4(e)
and 4(f), the latter image being about three hours after the eruption occurred. We also
assume the height of the cancelation region to be the same as the width, 5′′. So the total
accumulated ﬂux determined above would be BA = 3.9 × 1020, giving B ∼300 G. With
this value, and with the above dimensions for the ﬂux rope, we can estimate the amount
of energy built up in the ﬂux rope volume, V (= A× (width of 5′′)). Considering the
roughness in estimates for the ﬂux rope size and in the magnetic ﬁeld strength, we estimate
the accumulated energy= V B2/(8π) to be ≈ 2 × 1030 erg. With a wider ﬂux rope and/or
larger magnetic ﬁeld strength the estimate could be substantially higher, and so we can say
the accumulated energy is ∼1030—1031 erg.

4.3. Filament Formation and Ejection

We next examine the development of the second ﬁlament (the one that was prominent in
EUV images) that erupted with this event; in particular this question is of interest because,
as discussed above, the ﬁlament did not form and erupt from the main neutral line of the
AR. Looking at a 304 ˚A movie of the AR from near the time of its emergence until time
of eruption (video accompanying Fig. 2) shows that the ﬁlament in the region develops
over about 10—16 UT on October 18, which is about two days prior to eruption. From
magnetograms overlaid onto those images (Figs. 2(e) and 2(h)) and the accompanying video
(and also the magnetogram video accompanying Fig. 4), it is apparent that the ﬁlament forms
where positive-polarity ﬂux elements outside and to the west of the positive polarity pole of
the emerging ﬂux, canceled with surrounding negative-polarity ﬁeld over about that same
time period. From magnetogram images from about the time of Figure 4(b), we measure the
ﬁlament-forming canceling elements to be of moderate strength, of ∼100—300 G; arrows in
Figure 4(b) point to some of these ﬂux elements. These values are substantially weaker than
the strongest-ﬁeld portions of the emerging region at that time, which have strengths ranging
from ∼500 G and up to and exceeding 1000 G. Thus it is the intermediate-strength clumps

– 11 –

that cancel to make the ﬁlament, rather than the strongest-ﬁeld elements. These observations
of ﬂux cancelation as the mechanism for formation of the ﬁlament are fully consistent with
previous observational and theoretical studies (e.g. Martin 1986; van Ballegooijen & Martens
1989). The canceling ﬂuxes that form the ﬁlament are not concentrated enough to allow
for easy isolation and ﬂux-buildup and ﬂux-rate measurements, as we did above with the
canceling ﬂuxes in the core region, and therefore we do not attempt such measurements here.

Eruption of the ﬁlament begins with its liftoﬀ from the surface, which starts at about
08:41 UT on October 20; this is clearly later than the 08:32 UT start of the ﬂare in the core
region. Moreover, as the ﬁlament begins lifting oﬀ, remote ribbons of the region (arrows in
Fig. 2(e)) are also already illuminated. This means that new loops are being added to the
lobe overlaying that ﬁlament, as at that point the eruption is in a situation analogous to
Figure 1(b) in the jet picture (where the ﬁlament of this October 20 eruption initially sits
beneath the central, larger lobe rooted in polarities M1 and M2 of Fig. 1(a)). We suspect that
eruption of the ﬁlament is nonetheless triggered by the disruption resulting from the ﬂux rope
eruption along the main neutral line. Although it might seem counterintuitive to have the
ﬁlament erupt through an overlying lobe that contains newly closed ﬁeld (the dashed red loop
in Fig. 1(b)), we have seen evidence before (Sterling et al. 2014) for where a strong second-
stage ﬁlament erupted, apparently bursting through (or partially navigating around) newly
closed ﬁeld resulting from a ﬁrst-stage eruption. T¨or¨ok et al. (2011) present another example
of eruption through newly-closed ﬁeld, along with numerical simulations demonstrating the
plausibility of such complex eruptions. A likely possibility is that implosion of the ﬁeld
around the erupting core-region ﬂux rope triggers the eruption of the remote ﬁlament, the
so-called “Hudson Eﬀect,” from the ideas presented in Hudson (2000) (Janse & Low 2007;
Shen et al. 2012b; Panesar et al. 2013).

5. Eruption of 2010 July 16

Our second example is of AR 11088, which emerged on 2010 July 11 and resulted in
a GOES B-class ﬂare ﬁve days later on July 16. Figure 7 shows AIA 171 ˚A and 304 ˚A
images of this event. In this case a ﬁlament erupted from the main neutral line of the region,
and was directed toward Earth, and hence toward AIA. From the accompanying video, the
eruption begins near 15:00 UT, with strong ﬂare emission apparent about 20 min later.

Figure 8 and the accompanying video show that a CME that likely originated from this
eruption was visible in STEREO-B COR 1 images (from the online COR1 CME catalog:
cor1.gsfc.nasa.gov/catalog/), beginning from 15:41:02 UT on 2010 July 16, and, from Fig-
ure 8(b), obtaining a width of approximately 35◦. From this movie we estimate its speed to

– 12 –

be ∼250 km s−1. STEREO-A COR 1 shows what is likely the same CME from 16:30:18 UT.
SOHO/LASCO does not show a clear CME from this region, likely due to the CME’s small
width and on-disk location not far from disk center from the LASCO perspective.

Figure 9 shows the magnetic evolution of AR 11088, the source of this eruption, over
the ﬁve-day period from the region’s emergence until the eruption. Generally, the behavior
is similar to that of the 2013 event of §4, with the region emerging and then the poles of the
region separating, and then the poles retracting in on themselves, with cancelation occurring
at the location of the main neutral line. By the time of the eruption (Fig. 9(f)), the ﬂux has
clearly declined markedly from the earlier displayed times.

Figure 10 is analogous to Figure 5, showing in a time-distance map the evolution of
the positive and negative ﬂuxes with time. We created the map by integrating along the
north-south direction in the box of Figure 9, and so in this case the vertical axis of Figure 10
represents distance along the x-direction in the panels of Figure 9. This shows that, although
a substantial part of the ﬂux of the region still remains, a substantial portion of the emerged
ﬂux also has undergone cancelation by the time of the eruption (orange line).

Figure 11 shows quantitatively the amount of positive-ﬂux reduction over the life of the
region, where we have again selected only the positive ﬂux because it is (somewhat) easier
to isolate than the negative ﬂux of this region, where we have integrated that positive ﬂux
as a function of time over the location of the white box of Figure 9(a). Again we have
divided by the cosine of the region’s angle with disk center as a function of time. As with
the previous event, there again is an overall trend of ﬂux reduction with time. Inspection
of AIA 1600 ˚A, 1700 ˚A, and 4500 ˚A images together with the magnetograms shows that
a small positive-polarity spot appears near the time of emergence on July 11, and while it
fades to a small pore by the end of July 12, HMI magnetograms show that the concentrated
positive ﬂux of the spot continues to disperse over most of the period covered by Figure 11;
cancelation of this ﬂux apparently contributes to the steady decrease in positive ﬂux of the
region in Figure 11.

Between the start of the decline at about 20 UT on July 11 and the eruption onset
time of 15:00 UT on July 16, the ﬂux drops from 8.2 × 1020 Mx to 4.0 × 1020 Mx, so
the total reduction is 4.2 × 1020 Mx. Thus, over the 115-hr time period this is a rate of
∼3.7×1018 Mx/hr (and we assume an uncertainty of about the same level as in the ﬁrst
event: 0.2 × 1018 Mx/hr), and the total decrease is about 50% of the peak value.

Again we can estimate the energy built up in the expected ﬂux rope (or sheared ﬁeld)
resulting from the cancelation, again assuming that the canceled ﬂux (4.2 × 1020 Mx) goes
into a ﬂux rope. Using magnetograms to estimate the ﬂux rope size, from Figure 9(e) we

– 13 –

take its length to be 40′′, and we again use a width of 5′′. Following the procedure in §4.2,
here we obtain B ∼400 G. These values result in an estimate for the energy, V B2/(8π),
to be 2.4 × 1030 erg, and so similar to that of the 2013 event. With the previous provisos,
we again conclude that ∼1030—1031 erg of energy could have been accumulated from the
cancelation.

From the long-duration 304 ˚A movie accompanying Figure 7, we see that the ﬁlament
of the region began to form from about 10:00 UT on July 14 (again about two days prior
to eruption), with increased rate of formation from about 12:45 UT on July 15, and full
formation by 00:00 UT on July 16. Due to the data dropout over the second-half of July 14,
what happens with the magnetic ﬁeld during that time period is not clear in Figure 10;
that ﬁgure does however show cancelation at the bipole’s main neutral line occurring during
the second-half of July 15, consistent with that cancelation leading to the ﬁlament’s forma-
tion. Similarly, cancelation is apparent along that neutral line in the long-duration 304 ˚A
movie with overlaid magnetograms accompanying Figure 7, from about 22:00 UT on July 15
following a data gap.

6. Summary and Discussion

We have followed two diﬀerent small ARs, from the time that they emerged near the
solar east limb, until a time when they were the source for CME-producing eruptions. In
both cases: (1) the ARs emerged, (2) their poles moved away from each other until reaching a
maximum separation, (3) after that the poles started to retract in on themselves (shown well
in Figs. 5 and 10), (4) after some time this retraction led to magnetic ﬂux cancelation along
the main neutral line of the emerged bipole, and (5) eventually the continued cancelation
In the 2013 AR
led to an eruption along the main neutral line of the retracted bipole.
of §4, some of the positive ﬂux on the outskirts of the emerging ﬂux region canceled with
nearby negative-polarity ﬂux, and the prominent EUV ﬁlament of the region formed at that
location, which was east of the main (central) neutral line of the AR. In that case, the ﬁrst
eruption was of a (faint in EUV) ﬂux rope that formed along the main neutral line as a
result of the cancelation of the retracting region, and that blowout core eruption apparently
triggered eruption of the prominent EUV ﬁlament a few minutes later, plausibly via the
Hudson eﬀect. In the 2010 AR of §5, a ﬁlament developed along the main (central) neutral
line of the emerged/retracted AR, and it was that ﬁlament that erupted to generate the
CME.

Figures 3(b) and 7(b) show that the CMEs from these two small AR eruptions had
widths of ∼60◦ and 35◦. Not all coronal jets produce ejections observable in coronagraphs,

– 14 –

but when they do, typically coronal jets produce coronal ejections that are substantially
∼10◦, and called “white-light jets” or “narrow CMEs” (e.g.,
narrower than this, being <
Wang et al. 1998; Wang & Sheeley 2002; Nistic`o 2009; Paraschiv et al. 2010; Hong et al.
2011; Yu et al. 2014; Moore, Sterling, & Falconer 2015; Sterling et al. 2016). In some cases,
jets can trigger wider CMEs to erupt, when the magnetic ﬁeld that erupts to drive those
jets, i.e. the erupting miniﬁlament (or, presumably an “empty miniﬁlament ﬁeld” (ﬂux rope)
alone, if there is no cool miniﬁlament material on that ﬁeld), erupts into the base of a
coronal loop and drives that loop out (via its magnetic twist transferred to the loop) to
form a CME wider than 10◦. Because that larger coronal loop often forms the base of a
coronal streamer, we sometimes call these “streamer puﬀ” CMEs (Bemporad et al. 2005;
Panesar et al. 2016a). (Shen et al. 2012a also observe a “bubble-like” CME originating from
a jet region, and that event might also form as suggested in Panesar et al. 2016a.) In the
two small-AR CMEs studied here, the eruption leading to the CMEs originates along the
main neutral line of the ARs, rather than oﬀ to the side of the main neutral line of the
blown-out loops as is characteristic of streamer puﬀ CMEs. Therefore, the CMEs produced
by the two small ARs of this study diﬀer from the narrow CMEs or the streamer puﬀ CMEs
that occur with jets. At the same time, from a study by Gopalswamy et al. (2009) of over
10,000 CMEs, the average CME width is 44◦, but with a large number wider then 60◦ (see
Fig. 10 of Gopalswamy et al. 2009); hence, the small ARs of this study produced CMEs of
relatively moderate width. This is consistent with the idea that the small AR eruptions
of this study are on a continuum of solar eruptions occurring on diﬀerent size scales, with
coronal jets being smaller-sized eruptions, and many large-scale eruptions being bigger than
those presented here. This also agrees with the trend reported by Moore, Sterling, & Suess
(2007) for a direct proportionality between magnetic strength of the area from which the
eruption occurs and the ﬁnal width of the ejected CME.

An initial motivation for this investigation was our previous conclusions that many if
not all coronal jets are miniature versions of larger-scale CME-producing eruptions. If this is
true, then studying the triggering mechanism of coronal jets (which develop on a short time
scale of a couple days or less) could inform us of the triggering mechanism of larger-scale
eruptions (which develop on longer timescales, sometimes one or more solar rotations). We
found strong evidence that magnetic ﬂux cancelation builds and triggers the CME-producing
eruptions for both of our studied small ARs, supporting the suggestion that coronal jets are
useful proxies for studying the onset of larger-scale eruptions.

Additionally, we found evidence that ﬁlaments in both of our small ARs formed via
ﬂux cancelation. This has been found for large-scale ﬁlaments previously (see §1). More
recent observations show that ﬂux cancelation also builds miniﬁlaments that erupt to drive
jets (Panesar et al. 2017). Thus, our results here regarding ﬁlaments forming at cancelation

– 15 –

sites also supports that there is a continuum of similarly-produced ﬁlament-like features on
a variety of size scales that erupt.

We also note that AR ﬁlaments can form in a variety of ways, for example, shear-
ing motion and sunspot rotation (Yan et al. 2015) and complex magnetic changes (e.g.
Schmieder et al. 2004). Moreover, high-resolution investigations of formation and evolu-
tion of ﬁlaments show a wealth of complexities (e.g. Berger et al. 2008; Shen et al. 2015;
Yang et al. 2016a,b). Details such as these regarding ﬁlament formation are beyond the
scope of the current paper.

The two small eruptions of this study do show some diﬀerences from the miniﬁlaments
that erupt to produce jets; among these is the source of the cancelation that produces the
eruptions of this study, compared to the miniﬁlaments in the jet studies. Panesar et al.
(2017) found that, for the cases where they could make a determination, the eventually-
erupting miniﬁlaments form (a) when tiny grains of ﬂux coalesce to form a minority polar-
ity in a background majority-polarity region; or (b) the minority-polarity pole of a small
emerging bipole forms a bipole with a surrounding majority-polarity ﬂux clump, and the
miniﬁlament forms along the neutral line of that bipole. In both of the cases presented here,
the core erupting feature (a faint ﬂux rope in the 2013 case, and a well-deﬁned ﬁlament/ﬂux
rope in the 2010 case) both formed when the two poles of the emerged AR retracted in upon
themselves, and underwent ﬂux cancelation at the main neutral line of that same previously-
emerged bipole. For the AR jets studied by Sterling et al. (2017), the jets occurred in a
homologous fashion according to scenario (b). For the AR jets of Sterling et al. (2016) how-
ever, at least one of the jets (see §3.5 of Sterling et al. 2016) appears to have occurred along
the internal neutral line of a sheared-core emerged bipole, similar to the two events of the
present paper.

Because we suspect that the events here are larger-scale versions of coronal jets, and
because both the CME-producing eruptions of this paper and many jets result from ﬂux
cancelation, we can compare our ﬂux changes for the two events here with those of coronal
jets. We present these comparisons in Table 1 for coronal hole (CH) jets, quiet Sun (QS)
jets, AR jets, and the two small CME-producing eruptions of this paper. From this table, it
appears that the rate of ﬂux cancelation does not seem to be a determinate for the size of
the eruption that will occur, since the 2010 small-AR eruption made an eruption apparently
more energetic (1030—1031 erg) than the AR jets of Sterling et al. (2017) (1028—1029 erg),
while the rate of ﬂux cancelation in that 2010 small AR (4 × 1018 Mx/hr) was smaller than
that of those AR jets (1.5 × 1019 Mx/hr).

Rather, the results suggest instead that the total percentage of ﬂux of the entire region
that cancels may be more indicative of when an eruption may occur. Although the range of

– 16 –

values is large for the jets and the number of AR studied is small, currently the data indicate
that by the time ∼50% of the ﬂux of an isolated bipolar region has canceled, that region will
either have already erupted or eruption is imminent. This suggests a physical explanation
for the possible relationship between ﬂux-cancelation amount and eruption onset: it could be
that it is necessary for about 50% of the region’s total ﬂux to cancel for enough free energy to
be built up in the ﬂux rope (or sheared ﬁeld), together with the ﬁeld restraining the eruption
(the non-canceled ﬁeld) to be weak enough, for the eruption to take place. This suggests
that, at least for regions that are suﬃciently magnetically isolated from their surroundings,
monitoring the change in the amount of total ﬂux of a potentially erupting region — up
to and including large CME-producing regions — could provide a prognosticator for when
eruption will eventually take place. It will however be necessary to investigate additional
events before drawing ﬁrm conclusions regarding these speculations.

miniﬁlament is erupting and undergoing reconnection in two locations:
cutting” type) reconnection (larger red X), with the solid red lines showing the resulting
reconnected ﬁelds; the thick red semicircle represents the “jet-base bright point” (JBP).
External (a.k.a. “interchange” or “breakout” reconnection) occurs at the site of the smaller
red X, with the dashed lines indicating its two reconnection products. (c) If the external
reconnection proceeds far enough, then the miniﬁlament material can leak out onto the
open/far-reaching ﬁeld. Shaded areas represent heated jet material visible in X-rays and
some SDO/AIA EUV channels. See captions of e.g. Sterling et al. (2015) or Moore et al.
(2018) for a more detailed description. Labels M1, M2, and M3 are referred to in the text;
they respectively point out negative, positive, and negative photospheric polarity locations.

Fig. 2.— AIA 304 ˚A (a–c; g–i), and 131 ˚A (d–f) images of a small-AR CME-producing
eruption, from 2013 October. Contours in (d) are from an SDO/HMI magnetogram from
08:30 UT on October 20, and contours in (h) are from 16:45 UT on October 18, with red
and yellow contours respectively representing positive and negative ﬁeld. Arrows in (a—c)
point out a faint ﬂux rope erupting away from the core of the region, where the main neutral
line (d) is located. Overall, the basic eruption geometry is analogous to that of the coronal
jet in Fig. 1, where the ﬂare brightening along the neutral line in (d) corresponds to the
JBP in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), and where the arrows in (e) point to “external brightenings,”
corresponding to the footpoints of reconnected loop ﬁelds corresponding to the location
marked M1 in Fig. 1(a). Arrows in (h) point to a ﬁlament that forms along a neutral line
away from the main central neutral line; this ﬁlament is erupting in (f) and (i). Animations
of this ﬁgure are available. There are separate 304 ˚A animations for (a–c) and for (d–f), with
the former being of shorter duration, higher cadence, closer-in ﬁeld of view, and diﬀerent
color and intensity scalings than the latter, with parameters of the former tuned to facilitate
viewing of the faint ﬂux rope. In these and all other solar images in this paper, north is
up and west is to the right. For the event shown here, and in all other ﬁgures for this
2013 small-AR event, the images were diﬀerentially rotated to the common time of 2013
October 20, 09:00 UT.

Fig. 3.— SOHO/LASCO/C2 running diﬀerence image of the CME accompanying the erup-
tion of Fig. 2. White lines in (b) subtend an angle of ≈ 60◦. An animation of this ﬁgure is
available.

Fig. 4.— Magnetic ﬂux changes from HMI of the region of Fig. 2, with white/black rep-
resenting positive/negative ﬂuxes, respectively. The box in (a) shows the region used to
produce the ﬂux plot in Fig 5. Fluxes saturate at ±300 G. Arrows in (b) show examples
of mid-strength ﬂux elements that cancel to form the ﬁlament that erupts in Fig. 2(f). An
animation of this ﬁgure is available.

Fig. 5.— Time-distance map for the event of Fig. 2 for the ﬂux summed in the horizontal
(E-W) direction (i.e., in pixel rows) over the box of Fig. 4(a). Flux emerges near the start;
the two poles spread apart, reaching a maximum separation near 0 UT on 19 Oct; and then
the two poles converge back on themselves, with cancelation occurring at the central neutral
line of the bipole from approximately the start of October 20. A CME-producing eruption
occurred near 08:00 UT on October 20. Blue dashed lines indicate 00:00 UT for each day,
and the solid orange line shows the time of the eruption.

Fig. 6.— Variation with time of positive ﬂux for the event of Fig. 2, where the ﬂux is the
integrated positive-polarity ﬂux over the box in Fig. 4(a). Values are calculated assuming a
ﬁeld component vertical to the surface, where we have approximately corrected for foreshort-
ening by dividing by the cosine of the angle between the region and observed disk center
(see text). The green line is a least-square ﬁt over the period of the decay until the eruption
(from 19 October 05:30 UT until 20 October 11:45 UT), and the orange line marks the onset
time of the ﬂare/CME-producing eruption.

Fig. 7.— AIA ˚A and 304 ˚A images of a second small CME-producing eruption of this study,
this one from July 2010. Contours in (a) are from an HMI magnetogram from 15:15 UT on
July 16, and contours in (e) are from 09:45 UT on the same day, with red and blue contours
respectively representing positive and negative ﬁeld. In this case the ﬁlament is erupting
nearly directly out of the ﬁgure; arrows in (b) and in (e) point to the ﬁlament. Animations
of this ﬁgure are available. Jumps in time during the last half of July 14 in the animations
are due to SDO spacecraft pointing changes. For the event shown here, and in all other
ﬁgures for this 2010 small-AR event, the images were diﬀerentially rotated to the common
time of 2010 July 16, 15:30 UT.

Fig. 8.— STEREO/COR1 running diﬀerence image of the CME accompanying the eruption
of Fig. 7. White lines in (b) subtend an angle of ≈ 35◦. An animation of this ﬁgure is
available.

Fig. 9.— As in Fig. 4, but for the event of Fig. 7. The box in (a) shows the region used to
produce the ﬂux plot in Fig. 9. Fluxes saturate at ±300 G. An animation of this ﬁgure is
available. Jumps in time during the last half of July 14 in the animation are due to SDO
spacecraft pointing changes.

Fig. 10.— Time-distance map, as in Fig. 5 but for the event of Fig. 7, where the ﬂux is
summed along pixel columns in the vertical (N-S) direction of the box of Fig. 7(a). The
vertical strip during the last half of July 14 is an artifact resulting from SDO spacecraft
operations during that period, and so that portion of the map should be ignored. A CME-
producing eruption occurred near 15:00 UT on July 16; the solid orange line shows the
eruption time.

Fig. 11.— Variation with time of positive ﬂux for the event of Fig. 7, where the positive ﬂux
is integrated over the box in Fig. 7(a). Values are calculated assuming a ﬁeld component
vertical to the surface, where we have approximately corrected for foreshortening by dividing
by the cosine of the angle between the region and observed disk center (see text). The green
line is a least-square ﬁt over the period of the decay until the eruption (from 19 October
05:30 UT until 20 October 11:45 UT), and the orange line marks the onset time of the
ﬂare/CME-producing eruption.
