         Abstract 

Graphene  is  one  of  the  most  promising  2D  materials  for  various  applications  due  to its 

unique electronic properties and high thermal stability. In previous studies, it was shown that when 

graphene  is  deposited  onto  some  transition  metal  substrates,  small  molecules,  such  as  O2, 

intercalate between the graphene and the substrate and react to partially etch the graphene film 

when heated to desorb the intercalates. Here, carbon vacancy defects are intentionally formed on 

Gr/Ru(0001) and their effect on the intercalation of oxygen and etching of the graphene layer are 

investigated.  50  eV Ar+  sputtering  with  a  low  fluence  is  used  to  create  isolated  single  vacancy 

defects in the graphene overlayer and helium low energy ion scattering (LEIS) is employed for 

surface analysis. It is found that the defects both ease the intercalation of the oxygen molecules 

and improve the etching efficiency of the graphene during annealing.

I.  Introduction 

Graphene (Gr), an atomically thin sheet of sp2 bonded carbon, is regarded as a promising 

material for future carbon-based device architectures due to its particular electronic properties [1-

3]. The interface of graphene with other materials is a key part of developing large-scale graphene 

growth and forming conventional device contacts [4-6]. Moreover, graphene can also be used as a 

protection layer on metal surfaces to avoid oxidation or corrosion due to its chemical and thermal 

stability [7,8]. It is reported, however, that small molecules, such as O2, CO and H2O, intercalate 

between  a  deposited  graphene  overlayer  and  the  metal  substrate  when  exposed  above  room 

temperature or in the presence of defects [9-12].  

In  previous  work  [13],  helium  (He)  low  energy  ion  scattering  (LEIS)  was  used  to 

investigate the intercalation of oxygen underneath a Gr film deposited onto a Ru(0001) substrate. 

It was shown that the O2 intercalates when exposed at 650 K and that it remains in molecular form. 

It was further shown that the intercalated O2 desorbs from Gr/Ru(0001) when it is annealed to 800 

K  and,  in  doing  so,  etches  away  some  of  the  graphene.  The  intercalation  process  extends 

progressively from the edge of the graphene layer towards the center and a post-annealing at 823 

K leads to a rapid etching of the graphene edge, as shown in Ref. [10], which implies that the edge 

of the graphene film is more reactive than the intact areas of the film. Note that calculations have 

also suggested the atoms in the vicinity of a carbon vacancy defect also have a high reactivity [14]. 

It is thus important to study how the defects in deposited graphene layers, which commonly occur 

during  fabrication  and  cleaning  procedures,  affect  the  intercalation  of  small  molecules  and  the 

consequent etching reaction when the material is heated to remove the intercalates. In this paper, 

small defects are induced by a low fluence Ar+ sputtering of Gr/Ru(0001), and the results show 

2 

 
 
 
that the defects facilitate both the intercalation of oxygen and the etching of the graphene during 

the thermal desorption.  

The major tool used in this experiment is LEIS, which is well known for its extremely high 

surface  sensitivity  [15],  and  LEIS  has  been  previously  applied  to  measure  impurities  in  Gr 

overlayers [16]. The surface sensitivity is high when detecting the projectiles that scatter as ions 

because the Auger neutralization of He+ ions during the scattering process causes most of the ions 

that  experience  multiple  scattering  to  be  neutralized.  By  adjusting  the  scattering  angle,  a 

configuration can be obtained that probes only the Gr layer and any adsorbates, or the Gr layer 

along with any intercalates and revealed areas of the substrate.  

II. Experimental procedure 

 The experiment was conducted in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber that has a base 

pressure of 4×10-10 Torr and is equipped with an ion bombardment gun (Varian) for sputtering, low 

energy  electron  diffraction  (LEED)  optics  (Varian)  and  the  equipment  needed  for  the  LEIS 

experiments,  as  described  below.  The  1  cm  diameter  sample  is  mounted  on  the  foot  of  a 

manipulator that allows for rotations about both the polar and azimuthal angles. The manipulator 

foot contains an e-beam heater that uses a rhenium-coated tungsten filament that is floated at a 

high negative voltage to heat the sample up to 1400 K. The temperature is measured by K-type 

thermocouples spot welded to the sample plate.  

A  standard  procedure  is  used  for  the  preparation  of  a  clean  and  well-ordered  Ru(0001) 

surface, as reported in the literature [17,18]. The approach includes both ion bombardment and 

annealing (IBA) and a chemical reaction. First, a 30 min 500 eV Ar+ ion sputtering is performed 

using a flux of 4×1013 ions sec-1 cm-2. The spot size of the sputtering beam is 3×3 cm2, as measured 

3 

 
 
 
 
by a Faraday cup mounted near the sample holder, to ensure that the entire sample is uniformly 

bombarded. After sputtering, the sample is annealed under 4×10-8 Torr of O2 at 1100 K for 8 min 

followed by a flash annealing at 1300 K for 2 min under UHV to remove the carbon contaminants 

via chemical reaction with oxygen, as well as any oxygen residue. To acquire a sufficiently clean 

and  well-ordered  surface,  this  process  is  normally  repeated  several  times.  The  cleanliness  and 

crystallinity of the sample surface is verified with LEIS and LEED.  

The graphene layer is prepared by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method as reported 

in the literature [18]. This involves annealing the Ru(0001) sample to 900 K under 1.5×10-7 Torr 

of ethylene for 5 min, followed by a flash annealing under vacuum at 1200 K and then cooling to 

450 K for another 5 min. Repeating this growth cycle 3 or 4 times is generally required to get a 

fully-covered, single and continuous graphene layer on the Ru(0001) surface. The quality of the 

graphene layer is monitored with LEIS and LEED.  

Carbon  vacancy  defects  are  produced  via  Ar+  sputtering  performed  on  the  as-prepared 

Gr/Ru(0001) sample, as detailed in Ref. [14]. To remove only a few carbon atoms from Gr, a light 

sputtering is performed by defocusing the beam and setting the ion energy to 50 eV. As measured 

by the Faraday cup, the average beam density is 10 pA mm-2 and two different sputtering times (1 

min and 3 min) are employed. The total fluences of the 1 min and 3 min sputtering treatments are 

4´1011  ions  cm-2  and  1.2´1012  ions  cm-2,  respectively.  The  lattice  constant  for  free-standing 

graphene at room temperature is about 2.45 Å [19] so that there are about 2´1014 C atoms within 

each cm2. As a good approximation, only 1 out of 167 Gr carbon atoms is impacted during the 3 

min light sputtering. Considering the low energy and flux of the Ar+ ions, it is assumed that such 

a light sputtering leads to randomly distributed and isolated single carbon vacancies.  

4 

 
 
 
After introduction of defects in Gr/Ru(0001), O2 exposures are performed at a pressure of 

1.5×10-6 Torr with the sample held at 650 K to produce intercalated oxygen. The location of the 

oxygen beneath the Gr layer is confirmed with 3 keV He+ ion scattering using the method reported 

in Ref. [13]. Exposures in this paper are reported in units of Langmiurs (L), where 1 L = 1´10-6 

torr sec.  The sample is held at 650 K until the O2 is evacuated from the chamber. 

A  differentially  pumped  ion  gun  (PHI  model  04-303)  is  used  for  the  He+  LEIS 

measurements. The incident He+ ion beam has a diameter of 1.6 mm and a total sample current of 

1.5  nA.  The  scattered  ions  are  collected  by  a  Comstock  AC-901  hemispherical  electrostatic 

analyzer (ESA) that is mounted on the rotatable platform inside the UHV chamber, which allows 

for the scattering angle to be adjusted. The data collected in this paper uses a specular geometry in 

which the incident and outgoing angles are always equal with respect to the surface normal as the 

scattering angle is varied.   

To test for the occurrence of any beam-induced surface damage, five spectra were collected 

successively from the same spot of a Gr-covered Ru sample, and it was found that the C LEIS peak 

intensity  did  not  change.  To  completely  avoid  beam  damage,  the  samples  used  in  the  present 

experiments are re-prepared after the collection of three spectra.  

III. Results and Discussion 

LEIS data are normally analyzed classically and with the binary collision approximation 

(BCA)  [20]  due  to  the  small  de  Broglie  wavelength  of  the  incoming  ions  and  the  small  ratio 

between the scattering cross section and the interatomic spacings, respectively. In the BCA, the 

scattering process is considered as a series of interactions of the projectile with one atom in the 

crystal at a time. The ions that experience only one hard collision with a surface atom that is visible 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
to both the incoming ion beam and the detector produce a sharp single scattering peak (SSP) in a 

LEIS spectrum. The kinetic energy of the scattered projectiles in a SSP are determined primarily 

by the projectile/target mass ratio and the scattering angle, basically providing a mass spectrum of 

the surface composition [15]. To study defected and oxygen exposed Gr/Ru(0001), the areas of the 

C, O and Ru SSPs are computed by integration after subtracting the baseline of multiply scattered 

ions, which is modeled via a polynomial fit of the shoulder of the SSPs. When computing the ratio 

of SSP areas between different elements, a normalization based on the relative differential cross 

sections is employed [15,21].  

In order to backscatter from light target atoms, such as C and O, a light projectile is required, 

such as helium. Another advantage of using He+ for ion scattering is its high surface sensitivity 

due to Auger neutralization (AN) [15,22]. In AN, most of the projectiles that collide with multiple 

target atoms are neutralized due to the relatively large He ionization level compared to the size of 

the  surface  conduction  band. Thus,  the  signal  captured  by  the  ESA  consists  primarily  of  single 

scattering events from the outermost atomic layers. In addition, there is a strong matrix effect when 

helium ions are scattered from graphitic carbon [16,23,24]. This effect involves a quasi-resonant 

neutralization  in  conjunction  with  AN,  which  leads  to  a  very  high  neutral  fraction  for  primary 

incident beam energies below 2500 eV [25]. Therefore, to avoid the matrix effect and provide a 

strong signal of scattered He+, an incident beam energy of 3000 eV is used here.  

The experiments are performed using a specular geometry in which the incident and exit 

angles are equal with respect to the surface normal, and a scattering of angle or either 45° or 115° is 

employed [26]. At 45°, the incident and exit angles are grazing enough that only the outermost Gr 

layer and any adatoms adsorbed on it are probed. At the larger 115° angle, the ions penetrate the 

overlayer so that the spectra also probe any intercalates and some of the underlying substrate.  

6 

 
 
The cleanliness of the Ru(0001) surface and the growth of graphene onto it are verified 

with He+ LEIS and LEED. The clean Ru(0001) surface shows only a Ru SSP in LEIS spectra and 

a 1x1 LEED pattern. After producing a clean surface, LEIS at a scattering angle of 45° is used to 

monitor the outermost surface after the growth of graphene. Spectrum (a) in Fig. 1 shows only a 

C SSP, which indicates that the graphene overlayer completely covers the substrate. Since the cross 

section for the scattering from Ru is about 16 times larger than for scattering from C, this is a very 

sensitive measurement of the completeness of the overlayer. In addition, LEED images collected 

from this surface show a Moiré pattern due to the formation of a superlattice between the Gr film 

and the Ru(0001) substrate, as reported previously [27,28].  

A.  The role of defects in intercalation 

The defects on Gr/Ru(0001) are introduced by a 3 min 50 eV Ar+ sputtering, and 3 keV 

He+ ion scattering spectra collected at a 45° scattering angle are used to monitor any changes to 

the surface, as shown in spectrum (b) of Fig. 1. The sharp C SSP is still clearly seen in LEIS and 

the LEED Moiré pattern remains sharp, which indicate that the structure of the graphene overlayer 

is  not  overtly  affected  by  the  light  sputtering. There  is  a  small  Ru  SSP  in  the  spectrum,  which 

indicates that a small number of C vacancy defects are introduced by the light sputtering that reveal 

a small part of the substrate. This low fluence of Ar+ sputtering produces isolated single carbon 

vacancy defects, as described elsewhere [26].  

Because  the  sample  is  annealed  when  investigating  the  intercalation  of  oxygen  and  the 

reaction of intercalated oxygen with graphene below, the sputtered surface is annealed here as a 

control prior to oxygen exposure. The LEIS spectrum collected after the lightly sputtered sample 

is annealed to 1000 K is shown in spectrum (c) of Fig. 1. It is seen that the areas of the C and Ru 

7 

 
 
 
SSPs do not change and the Moiré LEED pattern is retained after the annealing, which implies that 

the defects on Gr/Ru(0001) are themselves stable, at least for annealing under 1000 K.  

In  addition,  as  shown in  our recent  work  [26],  oxygen  molecules  can  physically  absorb 

onto isolated carbon vacancy defects, even at room temperature, and the adsorbed oxygen diffuses 

and intercalates between graphene and Ru(0001) when the sample is heated to 600 K. To avoid the 

influence of oxygen attached to defect sites in the present measurements, the samples are held at 

650 K during the O2 exposures so that the all of the molecules intercalate. To confirm the location 

of oxygen after exposure of defective Gr/Ru(0001), a He+ ion scattering spectrum is collected at 

45° after a 3 min sputtering followed by a 6400 L O2 exposure at 650 K, as shown in Fig. 2. In this 

case, only the C SSP and a small Ru SSP are observed, which indicates that any adsorbed oxygen 

is intercalated below the Gr overlayer and none is present atop the Gr or at defect sites following 

O2 exposure at elevated temperature.  

To  explore  how  the  oxygen  intercalation  efficiency  is  affected  by  the  isolated  carbon 

vacancies produced by a light pre-sputtering, an O2 exposure of 900 L at 650 K is performed on 

the  as-prepared  Gr/Ru(0001)  and  on  Gr/Ru(0001)  with  1  min  pre-sputtering  and  3  min  pre-

sputtering, and the subsequent LEIS spectra are shown in Fig. 3. During the exposure, the sample 

is held at 650 K, and the spectra are collected at a 115° scattering angle to probe beneath the Gr 

film after the sample has cooled to room temperature. The figure shows that the areas of C SSPs 

do not change, but the areas of O SSPs increase with sputtering time. It is thus inferred that the 

oxygen intercalates easier on Gr/Ru(0001) as the concentration of C vacancy defects increases. 

In fact, it is shown in the LEEM images of Ref. [10] that the oxygen intercalates from the 

edges  of  graphene  flakes  on  a  Ru  substrate.  This  suggests  that  it  is  energetically  favorable  for 

oxygen to adsorb at the edge of the graphene film and to then diffuse to become intercalated if the 

8 

 
 
surface temperature is high enough to enable the diffusion. The mechanism is very similar in the 

presence  of  defects.  As  proposed  in  previous  reports  [29-33],  the  defects  and  dopants  on  2D 

materials, such as MoS2, boron nitride or graphene, act as active sites for molecular adsorption 

even at room temperature. In particular, our previous study of defects on Gr/Ru(0001) [26] showed 

that the oxygen adsorbs molecularly, even at room temperature, on single vacancy defects created 

by  light  sputtering  and  then  diffuses  between  the  graphene  film  and  Ru(0001)  substrate  when 

annealed to 600 K. It is thus reasonable to assume that when defect containing Gr/Ru(0001) is 

exposed  to  O2  at  elevated  temperature,  the  defect  sites  behave  as  transition  stations  for  the 

intercalation process, in which they keep adsorbing and transferring the adsorbates to the more 

stable  sites  beneath  the  graphene  overlayer.  This  process  increases  the  intercalation  rate  as 

compared to that of the original intact graphene layer. This indicates that defects further degrade 

the quality of graphene films on metal substrates, beyond the presence of the defects themselves, 

by increasing the probability and rate of intercalation. This effect will be particularly critical in 

applications in which graphene materials are exposed to an ambient environment and/or prepared 

at an elevated temperature. 

B.  The role of defects in the etching reaction 

 It has been reported that oxygen intercalated between Gr and Ru(0001) starts to desorb 

from the sample and react with the graphene overlayer when annealed to 750 K or above [13,34]. 

The annealing leads to both the removal of molecular O2 and the etching of some of the graphene, 

presumably through the formation of gaseous CO or CO2.  

To explore how this etching is affected by carbon vacancy defects, spectra collected from 

the as-prepared Gr/Ru(0001) are compared to those collected from the defect-containing samples 

9 

 
 
 
 
in Fig. 4. The as-prepared Gr/Ru(0001) samples and those pre-sputtered for 1 min and 3 min are 

exposed to 6400 L of O2 while being held at 650 K. Following the O2 exposures, an additional 10 

min  post-annealing  at  1000  K  is  employed  to  force  the  complete  desorption  of  the  intercalated 

oxygen.  Each  panel  of  Fig.  4  shows  He+  ion  scattering  spectra  collected  from  the  O2  exposed 

samples both before (dashed lines) and after (solid lines) the post-annealing. The spectra are all 

collected at 115°, so that the intercalated oxygen is detected. It is seen in Fig. 4 that the oxygen 

SSPs  are  absent  after  the  annealing,  confirming  that  the  desorption  process  is  complete  after 

annealing to 1000 K. The etching of graphene during the desorption process is indicated by the 

decrease of the C SSPs following annealing. It is clearly seen that magnitude of the decrease of 

the C SSP area increases with the fluence of the pre-sputtering treatment.  

In Fig. 5, the absolute amounts of C in the graphene film and intercalated O before and 

after the annealing are plotted, along with the ratio of C to the O decrease following the desorption 

process,  as  a  function  of  sputtering  time. The  amount  of  C  was  calculated  from  the  LEIS  data 

shown in Fig. 4 by assuming that the as-grown sample represents a full ML of Gr, and that the C 

SSP area is proportional to the Gr coverage. The oxygen coverage was calculated by normalizing 

the O SSP area to that of the C SSP after correcting for the differential cross section. Note that the 

O coverage may be an underestimate, as the He ions scattered from intercalated oxygen may be 

more prone to neutralization than those scattered from the Gr film, and some of oxygen may also 

be shadowed by the surface Gr. Nevertheless, the data in the figure does correctly show the trends 

in how the oxygen coverage and the ratio of lost C to lost O change.  

It  is  clearly  seen  that  the  amount  of  oxygen  decreases  to  the  same  level  after  the  post-

annealing  for  all  sputtering  times.  Since  the  intercalation  efficiency  depends  on  the  number  of 

defects on the surface, as discussed above, it is reasonable that a longer pre-sputtering time leads 

10 

 
 
 
to a slightly larger amount of oxygen intercalation even though the exposures are the same, which 

can be seen in the data of Fig. 5. Thus, the decrease of the amount of intercalated oxygen during 

the desorption process increases with pre-sputtering time because there is more oxygen that can 

be removed.  

Meanwhile,  the  decrease  in  the  amount  of  surface  carbon  following  annealing  is  much 

more affected by the number of surface defects. Although it may be expected that the C coverage 

would not decrease in the absence of defects, the data show a loss of 0.066 ML of C when the as-

prepared sample is heated, as was reported previously [13]. The data further show, however, that 

with increased sputtering time, the absolute decrease in the amount of C and the ratio of lost C to 

lost O during desorption both increase. That indicates that the defects introduced by the sputtering 

treatment improve the etching efficiency of the graphene layer.  

A reasonable explanation for how the defects created by the pre-sputtering ease the etching 

of graphene by intercalated oxygen is that the C atoms in the vicinity of the defects are more active 

in contrast to their inert behavior when intercalated beneath a complete graphene layer. As reported 

in Ref. [14], single carbon vacancies are introduced on Gr/Pt(111) by 140 eV Ar+ sputtering, which 

is also a weak graphene-metal interacting system similar to Gr/Ru(0001). In their DFT simulations, 

a 6´6 unit cell (4 cells of the 3´3 Gr/Pt(111) Moiré) was used. It was found that two of the three 

undercoordinated C atoms that surround a single C vacancy move closer to each other and form a 

pentagonal ring, becoming weakly bonded so that they could be etched first during the desorption 

process. In addition, the third atom and one of its neighbors moves out of the initial graphene plane 

towards the Pt substrate (distance decreases from 3.27 Å to 1.97 Å), forming two new chemical 

bonds with Pt atoms. This likely further improves the etching efficiency as the carbon-metal bond 

is easier to break than the carbon-carbon bond in defect-free graphene. It is also noted that the 

11 

 
 
 
average distance between the graphene overlayer and the Pt(111) substrate decreases by 0.1 Å due 

to the presence of the C vacancies, which could also enhance the etching reaction at the edges of 

the Gr films. 

IV. Conclusions 

Small molecules, such as O2, can intercalate between a graphene film and the substrate and 

the intercalated oxygen will etch the graphene overlayer when the sample is annealed to remove 

the  intercalated  oxygen  [9,10,13,34].  To  further  study  the  factors  that  affect  the  oxygen 

intercalation and the etching of Gr during the thermal desorption of oxygen, a light sputtering of 

the Gr/Ru(0001) surface was performed before the O2 exposures to create single carbon vacancy 

defects.  The  data  show  that  those  defects  improve  the  efficiency  of  oxygen  intercalation.  This 

implies  that  it  is  necessary  to  maintain  the  completeness  of  a  graphene  overlayer  when  storing 

graphene-based devices, as defects will cause the devices to degrade more quickly, especially when 

heating or fabricating them in air or low vacuum. Furthermore, it is shown that etching of the Gr 

film during the desorption of intercalated oxygen is more efficient in the presence of defects. It is 

thus concluded that the C atoms located near the defects or edges of the Gr film are less stably 

bonded  and  can  thus  more  easily  react  with  intercalated  oxygen  to  form  the  gaseous  etching 

products.

Figure 1. 3.0 keV He+ ion scattering spectra collected at a 45° scattering angle from (a) as prepared 

Gr/Ru(0001), (b) after a 3 min light sputtering, and (c) after post-annealing at 1000 K. The y-axes 

of the spectra are offset for clarity.

Figure  3.  3.0  keV  He+  LEIS  spectra  collected  at  a  scattering  angle  of  115°  from  Gr/Ru(0001) 

exposed to 900 L of O2 at 650 K following the indicated amounts of pre-sputtering. The spectra 

were collected after the sample cooled to room temperature.

Figure 4.  3.0 keV He+ LEIS spectra collected at a scattering angle of 115° from Gr/Ru(0001) 

exposed to 6400 L of O2 at 650 K (a) after a 3 min sputtering, (b) after a 1 min sputtering, and (c) 

without sputtering. The dashed lines show spectra collected right after the oxygen exposure, while 

the solid lines show spectra collected after an additional annealing at 1000 K for 10 min.

Figure 5. The left axis is used to show the amount of C and O on the surface before and after a 10 

min annealing at 1000 K, based on the data from Fig. 4, and are shown as a function of the amount 

of pre-sputtering before the O2 exposure. The right axis is used to indicate the ratio of the decrease 

of C coverage to the decrease of O coverage during the oxygen desorption. The ratio calculation 

includes  a  normalization  of  the  SSP  areas  by  the  respective  differential  cross  sections  for  He 

scattering from C and O.
