The rolling pad instability is caused by electromagnetic interactions in systems of horizon-

tal layers with strongly different electric conductivities. We analyze the instability for a

simpliﬁed model of a liquid metal battery (LMB), a promising device for large-scale sta-

tionary energy storage. Numerical simulations of the ﬂow and the dynamics of electromag-

netically coupled interfacial waves are performed using OpenFOAM. The work conﬁrms

the earlier conclusions that the instability is a signiﬁcant factor affecting battery’s opera-

tion. The critical role played by the ratio between the density differences across the two

interfaces is elucidated. It is found that the ratio determines the stability characteristics and

the type (symmetrically or antisymmetrically coupled) of dominant interfacial waves.

INTRODUCTION

This paper presents the results of numerical simulations of electromagnetically modiﬁed inter-

facial waves in a liquid metal battery (LMB) – a promising new device for large-scale stationary

energy storage. The principle of the battery’s operation and the complex electrochemical, mate-

rials, technological, and economical aspects are discussed in specialized literature, e.g., in Ref. 1.

The following brief description and the illustration in Fig. 1 are sufﬁcient for our analysis. The

version of the battery considered in the paper can be, in a simpliﬁed way, viewed as a cuboid vessel

ﬁlled with three liquid layers: heavy metalloid B (e.g., Bi, Sb, Zn, or PbSb) at the bottom, molten

salt electrolyte E in the middle, and light metal A (e.g., Na, Li, Ca, or Mg) at the top. The system

is stably stratiﬁed by density, with ρA < ρE < ρB. The electrolyte is immiscible with the metals

but conductive to positive ions of the light metal. The energy stored in the battery is the difference

between the Gibbs free energies of metal A in its pure state and in the state of alloy with the metal

B.

During discharging, the ions of A pass through the electrolyte and form the alloy within the

bottom layer. During charging, the ions are electrochemically reduced from the alloy and pass

into the top layer. The sidewalls of the vessel are electrically insulated. The top and bottom walls

contain current collectors for the electrons released or consumed during the charging/discharging

reactions. The resulting vertical currents ﬂowing through the battery are quite strong, with the den-
sity J ∼ 104 A/m2. The system is maintained at a temperature above the melting point of the three

materials, which is facilitated by the strong Joule heating of the electrically poorly conducting

electrolyte.

The system presents signiﬁcant challenges related to hydrodynamic effects, especially when
transition from small-scale laboratory prototypes to economically preferable large-scale (∼ 1 m3)

devices is considered (see Ref. 2 for a review). One such challenge is the need for mixing of

reactants in the bottom layer. Others are identiﬁed as hydrodynamic instabilities expected in large

batteries. When considering the instabilities, it is important to realize that if the deformation of the

electrolyte-metal interfaces is strong enough to bring the two metals into contact with each other,

it creates short circuit between the metal layers and, thus, requires immediate stop of the battery’s

operation. Any instability leading to such a deformation must be avoided.

Several instability mechanisms have been identiﬁed in recent studies: the Tayler instability,3–5
thermal convection caused by the Joule heating of the electrolyte6 or by bottom heating,7 the

Marangoni instability at the electrolyte-metal interfaces,8 and the rolling pad (also called metal
pad) instability.9–15 The ﬁrst three instabilities, while interesting and deﬁnitively affecting the

battery’s dynamics, are not expected to result in the just described disruption of operation.
Estimates5,6 show that, at realistic battery parameters, the forces leading to the instability are

balanced by the gravity force due to the density stratiﬁcation between the layers so that the grow-

ing perturbations saturate at a low amplitude of interface deformation. The situation is less clear

in the case of the rolling pad instability considered in this paper.

The mechanism of the rolling pad instability is known from the operation of the Hall-Héroult

aluminum reduction cells, each of which can, in a schematic and drastically simpliﬁed way, be

presented as the cell in Fig. 1 minus the top metal layer (see, e.g., Ref. 16). Many substantial

features of the Hall-Héroult cell differentiate it from the liquid metal battery: two layers instead of

three, a structured top current collector, the effects of gas bubbles and turbulent ﬂow of the melts,

low aspect ratio at very large (several m) horizontal dimensions, and so on. Both the systems,

however, have the same key feature necessary for the rolling pad instability, namely strong electric

currents passing through layers of vastly different electric conductivities. The conductivity of

molten salt electrolytes is about four orders of magnitude lower than the conductivity of liquid

metals. This means that even a small-amplitude deformation of the metal-electrolyte interface

causing a small-amplitude variation of the local electrolyte thickness along the current path leads

to signiﬁcant perturbations of currents and, thus, to signiﬁcant additional Lorentz forces acting on

the melts.

For the Hall-Héroult cells, it has been long understood that the Lorentz forces may create melt

3

ﬂows enhancing the interface deformation and leading to an instability in the form of a growing

interfacial wave rotating around the cell (the “rolling pad”). The key mechanism has been identi-

ﬁed as the interaction between the perturbation currents primarily closing within the metal due to

its high electric conductivity and the vertical component of the magnetic ﬁeld always present in
the cell.17–24

The possibility of a similar scenario in the case of liquid metal battery has been a subject of ac-
tive research recently. The ﬁrst approach9 was based on the mechanical analogy, in which sloshing

of two metal layers was modeled by oscillations of two rectangular solid pendula suspended in an

electrolyte. The main result was a demonstration, albeit in the framework of a strongly simpliﬁed

model, that the rolling pad instability mechanism is realizable in a three-layer system. This con-

clusion was conﬁrmed using a much more realistic model in the three-dimensional simulations of
a cylindrical battery cell.10 The instability was developing at the upper interface, where the density

jump was much smaller than at the lower one. It was concluded that the non-dimensional instabil-
ity parameter derived for the Hall-Héroult cells17 was also a good indicator of the instability in the
battery system. Further analysis was performed using two-dimensional shallow water models.12,13

While limited in their applicability to systems with low aspect ratio and low-to-moderate ampli-

tudes of interface deformation, such models provided the advantage of easier numerical solution

and stability analysis than for the three-dimensional model and allowed the authors to study var-

ious aspects of the instability. The two other recent studies remain to be mentioned: the linear
stability analysis,14 where the critical role of the non-conducting sidewalls was elucidated, the
theoretical and numerical analysis,11 where the hydrodynamic coupling between the waves at the

two interfaces was analyzed, and the perturbation theory analysis of waves in a cylindrical cell
with viscous, Joule dissipation, and capillary effects.15

This paper presents the results of the three-dimensional simulations of the rolling pad instability
in a liquid metal battery of cubic shape. As in the other studies of the instability,9–15 a simpliﬁed

physical model is used, in which the instability effect is separated from the effects of thermal

convection, Marangoni, and Tayler instabilities. The model is presented in detail in section II. The
numerical method described in section III is based on the OpenFoam25 and, in its many features,

similar to the method applied in Ref. 10. The simulation procedure is described in section IV.

The results presented in section V are quite different from those in Ref. 10 in that they pertain

to a cuboid rather than a cylindrical cell (a substantial difference for sloshing ﬂows), extend the

analysis to systems of various ratios between the density differences across the interfaces, and

apply a broader array of diagnostics tools thus putting the study into the context established by the
recent works.11–14

II. PHYSICAL MODEL

The liquid metal battery is a complex system. Its operation involves various physical mecha-

nisms, some of which are unknown. Therefore, a reasonable ﬁrst step toward understanding the

physics of the battery is to investigate each mechanism individually, isolated from the rest, and in
the framework of a simpliﬁed model. This approach has been applied to the Tayler instability,3–5
thermal convection,6,7 Marangoni instability,8 and the rolling pad instability.9–15

We apply the approach to the rolling pad instability. The simpliﬁed physical model is, in its

many aspects, similar to that used in Ref. 10 and based on the following main assumptions.

Simpliﬁed geometry: The geometry of the battery is simpliﬁed in our case to a cuboid with elec-

trically perfectly insulating sidewalls and the top and bottom walls serving as equipotential

current collectors (see Fig. 1a).

Simpliﬁed model of magnetic ﬁeld: The typical magnetic ﬁeld within an operating battery is

three-dimensional and possibly unsteady. A part of the ﬁeld, which is primarily horizon-

tal, is induced by the currents ﬂowing through the battery. The other part is truly three-

dimensional and is generated by the currents ﬂowing in the supply lines and neighboring
battery cells. By the analogy with aluminum reduction cells17–23 and based on the recent
results concerning the liquid metal batteries,9–15 we assume that the rolling pad instability is

caused by the vertical component of the magnetic ﬁeld. For this reason, we neglect all com-

ponents but the vertical one, which is approximated by a constant. In addition to removing

the effects of the Tayler instability and the electro-vortex ﬂow, this assumption also means

that we ignore the background ﬂow of the melts that would be induced by the interaction

between the variable component of the electric current and the three-dimensional magnetic

ﬁeld even when the interfaces are ﬂat. Only the electromagnetic interactions directly partic-

ipating in the rolling pad instability are retained in the model.

Absence of solid phase: During the discharge stage, poor mixing at insufﬁciently high tempera-
ture can cause formation of intermetallic solid in the bottom layer just below the interface.2

5

This effect is ignored in our study under the assumption that proper care is taken to avoid

this phenomenon generally detrimental for battery’s operation.

Immiscibility: The liquid metals forming the top and bottom layers of the liquid metal battery

are assumed to be immiscible with the electrolyte forming the middle layer.

Constant temperature: The liquid metals and the electrolyte are assumed to be maintained at the

same constant temperature. Accordingly, the effects of thermal and Marangoni convection
are ignored. The approximation is justiﬁed by the recent results6,8 showing that under typical

operational conditions the thermal and Marangoni convection are unlikely to perturb the

interfaces strongly and to have any signiﬁcant effect beyond additional mixing within each

layer.

Constant ﬂuid properties: Each ﬂuid is assumed to be incompressible, Newtonian and having

a constant electrical conductivity. The properties are, however, different among the three

ﬂuids. The coefﬁcients of surface tension at the two interfaces are assumed to be constant.

Ignoring mass transport through interfaces: The typical time scale of the processes analyzed

in this paper is tens to hundreds of seconds, which is much smaller than the typical time

of charging or discharging the battery. This allows us to ignore the change of mass and

physical properties of the metal layers due to the possible cross-interface diffusion and the

transport of ions through the electrolyte. The only manifestation of the ion motion is the

vertical electric current.

Quasi-static approximation of electromagnetic ﬁelds: Using the expected typical velocity U

below 0.1 m/s, the typical size L = 0.1 m, and the typical maximum electric conductivity
σ = 4×106 S/m, we estimate the magnetic Reynolds number as Rem ≡ ULσ µ0 = 4.5×10−2
(here µ0 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum). Even at larger UL, the number remains

substantially smaller than one. We can apply the quasi-static approximation, according to

which the magnetic ﬁeld induced by ﬂuid motion is neglected in comparison with the im-

posed ﬁeld in the expressions for the Ohm’s law and Lorentz force (see, e.g., Ref. 16).

Further simpliﬁcations, such as the shallowness of the system12,13 or small amplitude of
perturbations14,15 are not made in our model. Similarly to Ref. 10, the problem is solved as

three-dimensional, non-linear, and time-dependent.

6

The assumptions made above imply that in the unperturbed state, in which the interfaces be-

tween the layers are perfectly horizontal, the electric current is purely vertical and has constant

density:

J0 = J0ey.

(1)

As will be evident in the following discussion of the governing equations, the body forces and,

thus, the melt velocity are identically zero in this case. A deformation of the interfaces causes a

variation of the local thickness of the electrolyte, which leads to current perturbations j, Lorentz

forces, and melt ﬂows (see Fig. 1b).

The governing equations are based on the one-ﬂuid approach in its volume-of-ﬂuid version

(see, e.g., Ref. 26). This is an Eulerian method, in which the kinematic and dynamic conditions

at the interface are implemented on a ﬁxed grid via direct balances of ﬂuxes of mass, momentum,

and, in the case of our system, electric charge. The presence of each of the three liquids at a

given location is determined by its phase fraction 0 ≤ αi(x,t) ≤ 1, which is deﬁned as the volume

fraction of the liquid i in a computational cell. Only two phase fractions are independent, since at

every location we have

αi = 1,

The physical properties of the mixture are deﬁned as weighted averages. For the density, dynamic

viscosity and electrical conductivity, we have, respectively,

is the interface tension force approximated as a volumetric force active in the interface area,27 with

γi j being the constant coefﬁcient of interfacial tension.

The velocity is subject to the incompressibility constraint:

∇ · U = 0.

(8)

The constraint is satisﬁed in the standard manner via solution of the Poisson equation for the

modiﬁed pressure pd = p + ρgy.

As we have already mentioned, only the vertical component of the magnetic ﬁeld is included:

B = B0ey, B0 = const.

The electric current density is found using the Ohm’s law

J = σ (−∇φ + U × B)

and the charge conservation condition

∇ · J = 0,

which results in the elliptic equation for the electric potential φ :

∇ · (σ ∇φ ) = ∇ · (σ (U × B)).

(11)

(12)

The electric current can be viewed as the sum of the base current (1) and the current perturbations

caused by the deformation of the interfaces and the ﬂow of conducting ﬂuids in a constant magnetic

ﬁeld.

The no-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the walls:

U = 0 at x = 0, Lx, y = 0, Ly, z = 0, Lz.

The conditions on the electric potential include those of perfect insulation of the sidewalls:

(16)

The condition (15) is an approximation based on the assumption that the perturbations of the

electric current form loops closing entirely within the battery cell. The same condition was used

in Ref. 10. It is slightly different from the condition applied, e.g., in Ref. 12, where the potential

drop was adjusted continuously to account for the change of the total electric resistance of the cell.

The difference only appears at strong deformations of the interfaces and has no critical impact on

the instability even in that case.

III. NUMERICAL METHOD

Time-dependent three-dimensional solutions of the problem are computed using the ﬁnite-
volume CFD tool OpenFOAM.25 The method is similar to that applied to the rolling pad instability

in a cylindrical battery cell in Ref. 10. It is based on the solver for simulations of incompressible
multiphase ﬂows multiphaseInterFoam25,28,30 modiﬁed to include electromagnetic ﬁelds and ac-

count for sharp variations of the electrical conductivity.

The ﬁnite-volume technique is described in detail in, e.g., Ref. 30, so only a brief description

is given here. The spatial discretization is of the second order. The ﬁrst-order simple implicit
scheme is applied for time discretization. The PISO algorithm31 is applied to iteratively solve the

momentum and pressure equations. The advection equation for the phase fraction (4) is solved
using the implicit Euler time discretization and the spatial discretization by the MULES scheme29

based on the upwind interpolation outside the interface areas and a delimiter-based combination

of the linear and upwind interpolations inside it. The use of the compressive ﬂuxes allows the

solver to restrict the numerically diffused interface thickness to a few (typically two or three in our

simulations) cell widths.

The discretization of the electromagnetic equations is based on the conservative scheme.32,33

The potential equation (12) integrated over the ﬁnite volume cell Ω with faces A f , f = 1, . . . , n is

9

written as

n
∑
f =1

[σ f A f · (∇φ ) f ] =

n
∑
f =1

[σ f A f · (U × B) f ],

(17)

where the subscript f indicates the values at the midpoint of the cell faces f , (∇φ ) f is the face-

normal gradient evaluated by central differences, and (U × B) f is computed using linear interpo-
lation. The face-normal components of the electric current are calculated at the cell faces using

the Ohm’s law as

A f · J f = σ f

(cid:2)−A f · (∇φ ) f + A f · (U × B) f

(cid:3)

(18)

and then interpolated linearly to the cell’s centers to be used in the evaluation of the Lorentz force

(6).

The extreme (four orders of magnitude) difference between the electrical conductivities of the

electrolyte and the metals presents a challenge to accurate calculation of the electric potential and

currents, in particular to satisfying the charge conservation condition (11) in the interface area. We

have determined that the difﬁculties are resolved by two adjustments. One is the use of harmonic

interpolation for the evaluation of the electric conductivity of the multiphase mixture σ (see (3))

at the cell faces in (17) and (18):

σ f =

(cid:32)dN(cid:14)
d
σN

dP(cid:14)
d
σP

+

(cid:33)−1

,

(19)

where P and N are the two neighboring cell centers, d = |PN| is the distance between them, and

dN and dP are the distances from cell centers to the midpoint f of the cell face separating them

from each other (dN = | f N|, dP = | f P|). As discussed in the context of heat conduction in Ref. 34,

the harmonic interpolation avoids the unacceptably large error in the evaluation of ﬂuxes at cell

faces in the situation of strong variation of the transport coefﬁcient within the cell.

We have also found that satisfying the charge conservation and avoiding unacceptably large

spurious electric currents near the interfaces requires convergence of the iterative solution of (17)
to very low tolerance, at the level of 10−20. In the simulations presented in section V of this paper,

this typically required about 500 iterations.

The numerical model was veriﬁed by repeating several results presented in the earlier three-
dimensional simulations of the rolling pad instability in a cylindrical battery.10 Consistently good

agreement was found. In particular, we were able to accurately reproduce the period of interfacial

waves in an unstable system and the value of the threshold magnetic ﬁeld above which the system

experiences short circuit (see Fig. 10b of Ref. 10).

IV. SIMULATION PROCEDURE

A. Problem setting and diagnostics

The interior of the battery is modeled as a cube of side length Lx = Ly = Lz = 0.1 m (see

Fig. 1). This is approximately the size of the currently tested commercial LMB prototypes, but

substantially smaller than the size (∼ 1 m) of the envisioned large-scale batteries. Various values
of the unperturbed thickness of the electrolyte layer H0

E are used in the simulations. The layer is
always located in the middle of the cell, so the unperturbed thicknesses of the metal layers are
A = H0
H0
The square horizontal cross-section of the battery cell differentiates our work from the recent
studies, where cells of circular10 or rectangular12,13 cross-sections were considered. The analogy

B = (cid:0)Ly − H0

(cid:1) /2.

E

with the Hall-Héroult reduction cells leads us to expect the instability characterized by (i) the

threshold much lower than for rectangular cells, and (ii) possible spatial complexity and multitude
of instability modes.21 We will return to these expectations in the following analysis.

The physical properties of the materials corresponding to the Mg-Sb battery with NaCl-
KCl-MgCl2 electrolyte1 (see table I) are used in some of the simulations. This relatively well
studied9–14 combination of material properties is an example of the system with small density

difference across the upper interface ∆ρA ≡ ρE − ρA (cid:28) ∆ρB ≡ ρB − ρE. In order to see how the

instability changes in batteries with other ratios between ∆ρA and ∆ρB, the electrolyte density ρE

is varied in the other simulations, while the rest of the properties are kept the same.

The imposed vertical current J0 = 7850 A/m2 is used in all the simulations. The value φ0 of
the potential at the top wall is computed according to (16). The positive value of J0 implies that

the process of battery charging is simulated. Based on the physical mechanism established in
earlier studies9–14 and conﬁrmed in our work, the instability considered in the framework of our

simpliﬁed model is expected to have the same behavior in the course of charging, except for the
opposite direction of the precession of interfacial waves.12

Each simulation starts with the initial state, in which U = 0, J = J0ey, and φ is given by the

piecewise-linear function of y derived as a solution of (12) with the boundary conditions (14)–(16).

A weak perturbation of the electrolyte thickness is added to initiate the ﬂow. It has the shape

∆η A = 0.02z,

(20)

which implies the maximum amplitude of 2 mm. Each simulation is continued forward in time

electrolyte density ρE is different from the table value in some simulations. The other parameters used in

the simulations include the dimensions of the cell Lx = Ly = Lz = 0.1 m, the unperturbed current density

J0=7850 A/m2 and the interfacial tension coefﬁcients γA−E = 0.19 N/m, γB−E = 0.095 N/m.

until the behavior of the ﬂow becomes clear.

To investigate the effect of the initial conditions, we have repeated several simulations of unsta-

ble systems with different shapes of the initial perturbations as well as with the initial perturbations

applied to the bottom rather than top interface. As discussed and illustrated in section V C, these

changes affect the ﬁrst stage of the ﬂow evolution, but not the qualitative and quantitative charac-

teristics of the fully developed waves.

The solutions are visualized using the snapshots of the interfaces, distributions of velocity and
Lorentz force ﬁelds. The proﬁles of the upper and lower interfaces y = η A(x, z,t) and y = η B(x, z,t)

are determined during the simulations as the locations where, respectively, αB = 0.5 and αA = 0.5.

We also use the distributions of the vertical electric current density Jy(x, z,t) in the mid-plane of

the electrolyte layer y = 0.05 m, which is nearly reciprocal to the local thickness of the electrolyte.

The quantitative characteristics of the interfacial waves (period, growth or decay of amplitude)
are determined from the time signals of η A, η B and of the velocity and electric current components

at several points in the metal and electrolyte layers. The points are chosen along the vertical line

at x=0.05 m, z = 0.016 m, although any other line would give similar characteristics.

As in the previous simulations of the instability,10,12,13 the problem is solved in dimensional

units. This is justiﬁed by the multitude of relevant physical properties and the general desire to

keep the analysis focused on the realistic values of these properties. At the same time, it is useful

and interesting to consider the possible forms of the non-dimensional parameters controlling the
instability. From the three-dimensional analysis of the cylindrical cells10 and the shallow water

12

analysis of rectangular cells12 we conclude that in the case of small density difference across the

upper interface the key parameters are likely to be the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the
cell and the parameter17

reduction cells.

It estimates the typical ratio between the destabilizing Lorentz force and the

stabilizing effect of density stratiﬁcation. A similar parameter with ∆ρB in place of ∆ρA can be

formally introduced in the case of small density difference across the lower interface. There is no

reason to expect the parameter to accurately describe the instability in the cases where the density

differences across the two interfaces are comparable to each other.

The role of the other non-dimensional parameters, such as the Reynolds, Hartmann, and Weber

numbers remains largely unknown. We will leave this question to future studies, but note that

the expected large typical length scale of growing perturbations suggests that these parameters

somewhat affect the growth rate and the shape of the unstable modes, but do not change them in a

profound way.

The results reported in this paper can be recalculated into non-dimensional form using, for

example, the velocity of a large-scale gravitational wave on the upper interface

B. Computational grid and grid sensitivity tests

Constant time step and a structured Cartesian grid are used in all the simulations. The de-

sign of the grid is based on the following considerations. Firstly, we expect particularly strong

vertical gradients of velocity, electric potential, and other variables in the areas around the inter-

faces, especially when the interfaces are signiﬁcantly deformed. Secondly and more importantly,

accuracy of determining the position of the interfaces is critical for the overall accuracy of the

model. An error in the evaluation of the local relative change of HE leads to an approximately

σA/σE ∼ σB/σE (cid:29) 1 times bigger error in the evaluation of the perturbation currents and, thus, of

the Lorentz forces that drive the instability. An accurate volume-of-ﬂuid simulation of the inter-

face movement requires ﬁne resolution in the direction perpendicular to the interface. Since long

waves are expected to dominate in the ﬂows created by the rolling pad instability, this means a

requirement of ﬁne resolution in the vertical direction.

Constant grid steps ∆x = ∆z are used in the horizontal plane. In the y-direction, a constant

small grid step ∆ymin is used within the horizontal layer that extends on both sides sufﬁciently

far beyond the area of expected locations of the two interfaces. The position of this layer is not

necessarily symmetric with respect to the middle of the cell, since in some of the simulations, only

one interface is expected to move signiﬁcantly. In the metal domains below and above this layer,

∆y increases in geometric progression with the expansion rate chosen so that it reaches ∆ymax = 1

mm at the bottom and top boundaries of the cell.

Grid sensitivity tests were performed to determine the optimal values of ∆x = ∆z, ∆ymin, and

the time step ∆t. The grid was deemed sufﬁcient if further reﬁnement did not result in signiﬁcant

changes of the time period and peak values of the signals of velocity and electric current density.

A detailed description of the results can be found in Ref. 35. In summary, the spatial discretization

with ∆ymin = 0.2 mm and ∆x = ∆z = 2 mm is sufﬁcient for accurate simulations (see an example

in Fig. 2). The situation with the effect of the time step ∆t is more complex. We have found that, at

14

the spatial grid described above, ∆t = 4 × 10−3 s is sufﬁcient to avoid numerical instabilities and

accurately predict the velocity ﬁeld. At the same time, the signals of the vertical electric current Jy

inside and near the electrolyte, which is very sensitive to the accuracy of reproduction of interface
movement, only become truly ∆t-independent at ∆t below 2 × 10−3 s. Furthermore, ∆t must be

decreased in strongly unstable regimes, when the amplitudes of the interface deformation, electric

current perturbations, velocities and velocity gradients become large, and the electrolyte layer is
about to be ruptured. The strategy in the simulations was to use ∆t = 4 × 10−3 s, while periodically
conducting veriﬁcation runs at ∆t = 2 × 10−3 s and reducing ∆t in the cases of rapidly growing

perturbations.

V. RESULTS

A. Summary of completed simulations

The completed simulations are summarized in Table II. Each case is identiﬁed by the values

of the parameters varied in the study: the imposed vertical magnetic ﬁeld B0, the unperturbed
thickness of electrolyte H0

E, and the electrolyte density ρE. We also show the values of the non-
dimensional parameter β (see (21)) and the main period of the wave if it can be determined from

the time signals of the ﬂow variables. The last three columns show the characteristics of the ﬂow

regimes introduced later in the text: the stability identiﬁcation, the type of wave coupling, and the

typical ratio between the wave amplitudes at the upper and lower interfaces.

B. Examples of ﬂow behavior

In this section, we show three examples typifying the three principal scenarios possible in the
system. The electrolyte density is ρE = 1715 kg/m3 (a Mg-Sb battery), which corresponds to
∆ρA (cid:28) ∆ρB, and allows us to consider the solutions in the context of earlier studies.10,12–14

The ﬁrst example is the ﬂow at H0

E = 5 mm, B0 = 1 mT, and ρE = 1715 kg/m3 (case 1 in table
II). We see in Fig. 3 that the amplitudes of the interfacial waves created by the initial perturbation

decay with time. Similar decay is observed for all the other ﬂow variables, such as the kinetic

energy, perturbations of electric currents, etc. This allows us to identify the system as stable.

The second example illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5 is the ﬂow of the case 5, in which the system

parameters are the same as in the case 1, except that the strength of the vertical magnetic ﬁeld B0

TABLE II. Summary of completed simulations. Values of the imposed magnetic ﬁeld B0, unperturbed

electrolyte thickness H0

E, and electrolyte density ρE are shown. The other physical properties remain the

same in all simulations (see Table I). Also shown in the table are the value of the non-dimensional parameter

(21) (computed with ∆ρA in runs 1-17, and ∆ρB in runs 18-21) and the characteristics of the ﬂow: time

period of the unstable wave, stability identiﬁcation, and the type of coupling (‘A’ denotes the antisymmetric

coupling, while ‘S’ denotes the symmetric, in-phase coupling, both being described in detail in the text) and

the typical ratio of amplitudes of the waves at the upper and lower interfaces. Two digits are shown for the

amplitude ratios, but in some cases, in particular in ﬂows with rupture, only the ﬁrst digit can be reliably

determined.

FIG. 3. Stable ﬂow at H0

E = 5 mm, B0 = 1 mT, ρE = 1715 kg/m3 (case 1 in table II). The locations of the
upper (η A) and lower (η B) interfaces at x = 0.05 m, z = 0.016 are shown as functions of time. Note that the

scales used for η A and η B are strongly different.

is increased to 10 mT. Fig. 4 clearly shows that there are two stages of the ﬂow evolution. The

ﬁrst stage, lasting for about 60 s, is characterized by growth of the ﬂuctuation amplitudes of all

variables. During the second stage, which continues for the rest of the simulated ﬂow evolution,

the amplitudes remain approximately constant. The situation is identiﬁable as that of an instability

leading to nonlinear saturation at some level of ﬁnite-amplitude perturbations.

The quantitative characteristics of the interfacial wave in the saturated ﬂow regime can be

determined from the plots in Fig. 4 and other simulation data not shown here. The dominant

period of the wave is about 3.3 s. The amplitude of the ﬂuctuation is slightly less than 2.5 mm

for the upper interface, and much smaller, about 0.07 mm for the lower interface. As we see in,

respectively, Figs. 4b and 4c, the resulting variations of the local thickness of electrolyte result in
strong (up to 5000 A/m2 in amplitude) ﬂuctuations of the vertical current and strong (up to 2000
A/m2) horizontal currents in the metal layer. The melt ﬂows associated with the wave are not

strong. The typical magnitude of the horizontal velocity components is ∼ 1 cm/s in the electrolyte

and smaller than that in the metal layers (see Figs. 4d-f). It is interesting that the velocity in the

electrolyte ﬂuctuates around zero, while the signals of velocity in the metal layers show additional

strong variations on the typical time scale of many tens of s. Our analysis of the evolution of the

17

Time [s]A [m]B [m]02040600.05240.05290.047310.04733BAvelocity structure indicates that this behavior is a reﬂection of a slow transformation of the rotating

pattern of horizontal velocity associated with the wave.

We need to stress that the just mentioned ﬂuctuation amplitudes refer to the signals recorded

at the speciﬁc locations used in Fig. 4. Signals recorded at other points would produce different

values. The order of magnitude and the general characteristics of the wave, such as the lengths

of growth and saturation stages, time period, and the qualitative shape of the signal curves would,

however, remain the same.

The structure of the ﬂow with a fully developed wave (the saturation stage) is illustrated in

Fig. 5. The interfacial waves presented as three-dimensional (in Fig. 5a) and two-dimensional
(in Figs. 5c and d) plots of η A(x, z) and η B(x, z) are qualitatively similar to the typical waves
observed in the two layer systems (aluminum reduction cells)22,23,36 and three-layer systems with
∆ρ A (cid:28) ∆ρ B.10–15 The waves are characterized by the wavelength comparable with the horizontal

size of the cell and the zone of large-amplitude interface deformation located near the sidewall.
The pattern rotates clockwise if viewed from above (see animations37). The rotation is responsible
for the nearly periodic oscillations of η A, η B and other variables shown in Fig. 4. Two interesting

and useful for our further discussion observations can be made. One is that the wave at the upper

interface has much larger amplitude than the lower interface wave. Another observation is that the

two waves are antisymmetrically (with the phase shift of 180 degree) coupled.

The distribution of the vertical electric current Jy in the electrolyte (see Fig. 5b) follows closely

the variation of the local electrolyte thickness, thus the high-amplitude interfacial wave at the

upper interface. The distributions of other variables, such as ﬂow velocity (see Fig. 5e) or Lorentz

force (see Fig. 5f) cannot be explained that simply but are evidently parts of the ﬂow associated

with the electromagnetically coupled interfacial waves.

In addition to causing local current perturbations, the variation of the electrolyte thickness

caused by interfacial waves also changes the overall impedance RLMB of the battery. This affects

the energy efﬁciency. In our model simulations, in which the voltage drop across the battery re-

mains constant, the impedance changes are manifested as the reciprocal variations of the total

(integrated over a horizontal cross-section) vertical current JLMB. Furthermore, the mass conser-

vation of liquid phases implies that the integral of the perturbation of electrolyte thickness and,

thus, of the perturbation of local electric resistance are zero. One should expect decreased overall

impedance and increased total current in this case.

An example shown in Fig. 6 illustrates the typical behavior found in the simulated ﬂows with

instability. The time-averaged overall current is about 89.6 A, which is noticeably larger than 78.5

A for the unperturbed battery. The interfacial wave signiﬁcantly reduces the overall impedance of

the cell. We also see ﬂuctuations correlating with the evolution of the wave. This is to be expected

for a wave of ﬁnite amplitude, which changes its shape in the course of its progression around the

battery.

We note that in the case 5 as in all the other cases identiﬁed in table II as those with saturation,

the interface deformation never grows as strong as to cause a rupture of the electrolyte layer and

short circuit between the metal layer. The system is hydrodynamically unstable, but this does not

result in operational failure of the battery.

Our third example is the case 7 in table II. The system’s parameters are the same as in the

cases 1 and 5, but the vertical magnetic ﬁeld B0 is now increased to 20 mT. We see in Fig. 7 that

the system is unstable and that the outcome of the instability is different from that observed in

the previous example. The perturbations do not saturate but continue to grow until the electrolyte

layer ruptures at some point. This implies zero overall impedance of the electrolyte layer and a

short circuit between the metal layers, which makes further operation of the battery impossible.

The situation can be identiﬁed as that of not just hydrodynamic, but also operational instability.

The structure of the ﬂow about 0.5 s before the rupture is illustrated in Fig. 8. We see current

perturbations, velocity and velocity gradients of the amplitudes comparable to those in case 5. The

situation changes shortly before the rupture. At illustrated in Fig. 9, the interfaces nearly touch

each other in a small area in the corner of the cell (the corner location was observed in all our
simulations with rupture). The vertical electric current grows to about 106 A/m2 in this corner,

which results in very strong localized horizontal current perturbations and Lorentz forces.

At the moment of rupture, the vertical current increases further. The numerical model fails to

converge, so the simulations must be stopped. It should be stressed that during the short time in-

terval before the rupture, the small-scale, strong-gradient features appearing in the ﬂow imply that

the accuracy of the model’s prediction is lower than estimated in our grid sensitivity studies. Addi-

tional simulations performed on a reﬁned grid and with substantially reduced time step produced

a qualitatively and quantitatively similar ﬂow. The rupture event was delayed by a just fraction of

a second. This indicates that the electrolyte rupture observed in the simulations is a real physical

effect and not an artifact of the numerical model.

C. Effects of system parameters

In this section we analyze how the system’s behavior is affected by the key parameters of the

and the electrolyte density ρE. The discussion is based on the data summarized in Table II and the

illustrations in Figs. 3-14.

The following discussion will beneﬁt from a reference to the recent analysis of interfacial waves
in a stably-stratiﬁed three-layer system.11 Flow in a cylindrical vessel without electromagnetic

effects was considered. Two possible solution modes were identiﬁed. One was the fast mode with

high oscillation frequency and symmetric (in-phase) coupling between the waves on the upper and
lower interfaces. Another was the slow mode with lower frequency and antisymmetric (with 180◦

degree phase shift) coupling. The solutions of the two types also differ from each other by the

typical ratios between the amplitudes of the upper and lower interface waves.

The system considered in this paper is evidently very different from that of Ref. 11 due to the

different geometry and the effects of viscosity and surface tension. The electromagnetic effects

provide an additional coupling and forcing mechanisms and may inﬂuence the modes themselves

and the selection between them in a particular solution. Nevertheless, as we will see below, the

classiﬁcation remains valid and useful in the analysis.

We start with the cases 1-13, in which ∆ρA (cid:28) ∆ρB. The three ﬂows used as examples in section

V B (see Figs. 3-9) belong to this group. Further information is provided in Table II and Fig. 10.

We clearly see that the solutions have the form of a slow mode in the classiﬁcation of Ref. 11. The

typical time period T is large in comparison to the other cases. The waves at the two interfaces

are coupled antisymmetrically (see Figs. 3, 4, 7, 10). Finally, the wave amplitude on the upper

interface is much (20 to 60 times) larger than the amplitude of the lower interface wave. This is in

agreement with the results of calculations for the material properties of a Mg-Sb cell presented in
Fig. 4 of Ref. 11. For the typical horizontal wavenumber ∼ 20m−1 (observed in our simulations
as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 8), the slow modes are expected to have ∆η A one to two orders of
magnitude larger than ∆η B. The growth of ∆η A/∆η B with increasing H0

E (see Table II) is also

24

consistent with the behavior of the slow mode solutions illustrated in Fig. 4 of Ref. 11.

The combination of the material properties in the cases 1-12 corresponds to the Mg-Sb battery,
which is relatively well studied in literature.10–14 It has been found (see, e.g. Refs. 10 and 12)

that the value of the parameter β deﬁned by (21) is an important, albeit not unique, factor of

the instability in a cell of a given shape of the horizontal cross-section. The data in Table II
are partially consistent with this conclusion. As we increase B0, while keeping H0
E = 5 mm and
ρE = 1715 kg/m3, the state of the system changes from stable at approximately β less than one

(cases 1 and 2) to saturated at β up to about 4 (cases 3-6) and then to ruptured (cases 7 and 8).

The threshold values of β are reasonably close to those of Ref. 10 with the difference attributable

to different cell geometries (a cylinder on Ref. 10 and a cube in our case).

The situation with the effect of the electrolyte thickness H0
6, 9-12) are performed at B0 = 15 mT, ρE = 1715 kg/m3, and H0

E is less clear. Five simulations (cases
E increasing from 3 to 20 mm.
This corresponds to decrease of β , and, if β is the parameter controlling the instability, should lead
to less unstable behavior. This is observed in the transition from case 9 (H0

electrolyte layer is observed (cases 10-12), even though increase of H0

E = 3 mm, β = 5.984,
E, however, rupture of the
E within this group leads to
slower growth of the unstable wave (compare the signals for cases 10 and 12 in Fig. 10). We note

that special care has been given to assure adequate grid resolution of the ﬂow in these cases. For
example, in the case 12, the ﬁne mesh with ∆y = ∆ymin = 2 × 10−4 m was used at 0.02 ≤ y ≤ 0.08.

This can be compared with the highest (just before the rupture) position of the upper interface at

about y = 0.0668. We conclude that the most plausible explanation of the behavior in the cases 6,

9-12 is that β is an imperfect instability parameter for such systems.

The analysis11 also shows that, for solutions with ∆η A (cid:29) ∆η B, the behavior of the wave on

the upper interface is close to that of the wave developing in a two-layer system. The presence

of the lower interface has only small impact. The fact that such solutions are found in our and
other10–15 studies of the Mg-Sb cells is, therefore, consistent with the detected at least partial role

of β derived for a two-layer aluminum reduction cell as the instability parameter.

In the cases 14-17, the electrolyte density ρE is such that the density differences across the lower

and upper interfaces are the same. The system is stable in all these cases even though β can be as

large as 6 (in case 17). No consistent growth of perturbations is found. Instead, the perturbations

decay initially and then the ﬂow shows nearly periodic oscillations of approximately constant

small amplitude. An illustration in the form of the signals of interface locations is provided in

Fig. 11. We see that the waves are coupled symmetrically (in-phase with each other) and have

much smaller time period (between 0.24 and 0.5 s) than the waves observed in the cases 1-13.

This allows us to identify them as the fast modes according to the classiﬁcation of Ref. 11. We

also see in Fig. 11 that the amplitudes of the upper and lower interfacial waves are nearly equal to

The spatial structure of the ﬂow is illustrated in Fig. 12 as spatial distributions of HE(x, z,t) on
upper (η A) and lower interface (η B). The combination of symmetric coupling and nearly equal

Some variations of HE(x, z,t) and Jy(x, z,t) on the small length scale are found, but they are of

small and not growing amplitude. We conclude that the fast mode solutions realized in our system

at ∆ρA = ∆ρB do not generate signiﬁcant Lorentz forces and, thus, cannot lead to the rolling pad

instability.

Another feature of the interfacial waves in ﬂows with ∆ρA = ∆ρB is that, unlike in the unstable

ﬂows at ∆ρA (cid:28) ∆ρB, the shape of the wave remains strongly correlated with the shape imposed as

an initial perturbation. We see in Fig. 12 that, apart from effect of rotation and development of a

wave at the lower interface, the shape resembles the initial constant slope wave 60 s after the start.

The just reported ﬁndings can be compared with the results of the two-dimensional model of
shallow battery cells of rectangular cross-section,12 to our knowledge the only other study where

the case ∆ρA = ∆ρB is considered. Despite the evident differences in the geometry and modeling

approach, the results of the two studies are in clear quantitative agreement with each other. Stable

solutions in the form of symmetrically coupled waves of approximately equal amplitudes are found

in both studies.

The situation when ∆ρA (cid:29) ∆ρB is represented by the cases 18-21. As illustrated in Fig. 13,

the ﬂow can be unstable. Growth of perturbations occurs and ends in saturation in the ﬂow with

β (based on ∆ρB) equal to 0.917 (case 18) and 1.833 (case 19). Growth leading to rupture of

electrolyte occurs at β = 3.666 (case 20) and 6.11 (case 21). The analysis of the distributions of

ﬂow variables and time signals, such as those in Fig. 13, leads us to the conclusion that the solu-

tions are superpositions of fast and slow modes. The fast modes cause the high-frequency (period

of about 0.5 s) symmetric oscillations with approximately equal amplitudes on both interfaces.

The slow modes are responsible for low-frequency (period between 4.4 and 4.7 s) antisymmetric

oscillations. Their amplitudes cannot be accurately determined from the data in Fig. 13. For this

reason only the amplitude ratios of the fast mode oscillations are listed in Table II. Nevertheless

we clearly see that the amplitude of the slow mode is signiﬁcantly higher on the lower than on the

upper interface. Interestingly, the slow modes are only noticeably strong when the perturbations

are growing, i.e. during the initial growth stage in the saturation cases 18 and 19 and during the en-

tire ﬂow evolution in the rupture cases 20 and 21. During the saturation phase in cases 18 and 19,

the amplitude of the slow mode oscillations gradually decreases until they practically disappear.

The typical spatial structure of the ﬂows in the cases 18-21 is illustrated in Fig. 14. We see that
the upper (η A) and lower interface (η B) are coupled and oscillated symmetrically while the ampli-

tude of oscillation differs from upper and lower interface. This implies variable local electrolyte

thickness and, thus, Lorentz forces and the possibility of unstable behavior.

We conclude that in the simulations with ∆ρA (cid:29) ∆ρB (cases 18-21), the rolling pad instability

is caused by the slow modes developing at the lower interface. Unlike the ﬂows with ∆ρA (cid:28) ∆ρB,

however, the unstable waves evolve in the presence of strong fast mode oscillations.

We will now discuss the effect of the form of the initial perturbations. All the simulations

presented so far were initialized by a slight incline of the upper interface (20). The simulations

show that shape of the wave is retained by stable ﬂows, in particular by the ﬂows with ∆ρA = ∆ρB

(cases 14-17). The situation is quite different for unstable ﬂows, in which the initial conditions

only affect the early evolution. The ﬁnal fully developed state is determined by the instability

mechanism.

interfaces.

Our ﬁrst illustration is the test simulations in which the initial perturbation of the same shape

are applied to the lower rather than upper interface. This does not change the initial distribution

of the Lorentz forces, but affects the initial potential energy of the perturbations, speciﬁcally its

distribution between the waves on the upper and lower interfaces and its total magnitude, which

is proportional to the density difference across the perturbed interface. One may justiﬁably ask

whether this would affect the selection between fast and slow modes or affect the solution in some

other way.

The results of the numerical experiments carried out for cases 5 and 19 are shown in Fig. 15.

We see that the change of the initial conditions does not inﬂuence the solution in any major way.

In the second test, the perturbations are imposed at the upper interface but have a different

shape, smaller horizontal length scale, and smaller (with the maximum of 0.25 mm) amplitude:

∆η A = 0.00025 cos(80πx) cos(80πz).

The results obtained for the case 5 are presented in Fig. 16. We see that the instability takes

much longer to develop at the new initial conditions. At the fully developed stage, however, the

The simulation results reported in this paper conﬁrm the conclusion reached earlier in the stud-
ies of other geometries10–15 that the rolling pad instability is a signiﬁcant factor affecting perfor-

mance of liquid metal batteries. In particular, batteries with much smaller density difference across

the upper interface (∆ρA (cid:28) ∆ρB), for example the better studied Mg-Sb battery, become unstable

and face the danger of a ruptured electrolyte layer if the vertical component of the magnetic ﬁeld is

too large. The instability is caused by growing antisymmetrically coupled interfacial waves, which

can be identiﬁed as the slow modes in the classiﬁcation of Ref. 11. The wave amplitude is much

larger on the upper than on the lower interface in such solutions, and the behavior is qualitatively

similar to the behavior of unstable waves in two-layer aluminum reductions cells.

Much less expected and, to our knowledge, entirely new results are found for the much less

explored conﬁgurations in which ∆ρA = ∆ρB or ∆ρA (cid:29) ∆ρB. We see that the analogy with the

aluminum reduction cells would be misleading for such systems. In addition to the slow modes,
the symmetrically coupled fast modes11 appear in the solution. At ∆ρA = ∆ρB, only the fast

modes are present. Having nearly equal amplitudes, the interfacial waves do not cause signiﬁcant

variations of electrolyte thickness and, therefore, cannot cause the rolling pad instability. The

interfacial waves that appear in batteries with ∆ρA (cid:29) ∆ρB are superpositions of fast and slow

modes, with the latter causing the instability.

The results are consistent with the ﬁndings of earlier works,10–15 in which batteries of other

geometries (cylinders or shallow parallelepipeds) were considered. Speciﬁcally, qualitative agree-

ment is found with Refs. 10–15 for the case ∆ρA (cid:28) ∆ρB and with Ref. 12 for the case ∆ρA = ∆ρB.

Our parametric study is incomplete, since only a small sample of possible combinations of

material properties could be covered. Furthermore, comparison of our results with the results

of earlier studies conﬁrms the rather evident conclusion that the interfacial wave solutions are

critically affected by the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the battery cell. An exhaustive

parametric study of the rolling pad instability would be unjustiﬁably difﬁcult and costly to com-

plete. Analyzing speciﬁc shapes and material combinations of the battery versions selected for

commercialization appears to be a more promising path of future research.

A practically relevant numerical model of a working battery cell would require accurate de-

scription of a large number of diverse physical effects. In addition to the effects addressed in this

paper, the list includes the thermal and concentration convection, diffusive and convective mass

34

transport, surface tension, Tayler instability, electrovortex effect, etc. Full three-dimensional mag-

netic ﬁeld has to be included. No such comprehensive simulations have been done so far. The

question whether such a simulation is possible at the current level of computer modeling tech-

niques remains open. The OpenFOAM seems a promising tool due to the abundance of already

developed and veriﬁed solver modules and the relative easiness of implementation of physical
models. Our work and the earlier studies10,11 suggest that one computationally particularly chal-

lenging task, namely the description of the interface motion and the associated electric currents,

can be accomplished with the help of the OpenFOAM. Acceptable, albeit not perfect accuracy is

achieved on a properly reﬁned grid if appropriate modiﬁcations of the discretization scheme (see

section III) are made.
