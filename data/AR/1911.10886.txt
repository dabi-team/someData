In this paper we investigate the production of pentaquark states in the photon – proton inter-
actions present in hadronic collisions at the RHIC and LHC. We consider two phenomenological
models for the J/Ψ photoproduction that consider the presence of the Pc(4312), Pc(4440) and
Pc(4457) resonances in the s – channel of the γp → J/Ψp reaction. The rapidity distribution is
estimated for pA collisions at the RHIC and LHC. Predictions for pP b, P b Ar and P b He ﬁxed –
target collisions at the LHC are also presented. We demonstrate that the experimental analysis of
the J/Ψ photoproduction in ﬁxed – target collisions can provide complementary and independent
checks on these states, and help to understand their underlying nature.

PACS numbers:

In the last years a series of charmoniumlike exotic states has been announced at various experimental facilities (For
reviews see, e.g., Refs. [1, 2]). Such states decay to ﬁnal states that contain a charm and an anticharm but cannot
be easily accommodated in the remaining unﬁlled states in the c¯c level scheme. Recently, the LHCb Collaboration
has reported their new results for the Λ0
J/ΨpK − decay, which indicate the existence of three narrow pentaquark
states: Pc(4312), Pc(4440) and Pc(4457) [3]. Such observation motivated a series of theoretical studies as well
In particular, the GlueX Collaboration
as the search of these states in other processes (See e.g. Refs.
searched for the pentaquark states in the near-threshold J/Ψ exclusive photoproduction oﬀ the proton [11] and the
D0 Collaboration have analyzed the production of these states in p¯p collisions [12]. While the experimental results
from D0 Collaboration ﬁnd an enhancement in the J/Ψp invariant mass consistent with a sum of the resonances
Pc(4440) and Pc(4457) reported by the LHCb Collaboration, the GlueX Collaboration did not see evidence for them.
Such results indicate that the proposition of new reaction channels that can be used to probe the existence and to
decipher the nature of these states is timely and welcome.

In this paper we will analyze the possibility to probe the pentaquark states in photon – induced interactions
at the RHIC and LHC, which are dominant at large impact parameters (b > R1 + R2, where Ri is the hadron
radius). The results obtained in Refs. [13–15] have demonstrated that the properties of exotic states can be studied
by considering its production in the photon – photon interactions present in ultraperipheral collisions. Another
possibility is to consider the production of exotic states in photon – hadron interactions. As demonstrated for the
ﬁrst time in Ref.
[17], hadronic collisions can be used to study the production of
charged Zc charmoniumlike states in photon – hadron interactions. In our analysis we will extend previous studies for
the exclusive J/Ψ photoproduction in pP b collisions at the LHC, which estimated the contribution of the Pomeron
exchange for the cross section [represented in Fig. 1 (a)], by taking into account the contribution associated to the
presence of the Pc(4312), Pc(4440) and Pc(4457) resonances in the s – channel [See Fig. 1 (b)]. Motivated by the
[18], where we have demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that photon – induced interactions
results presented in Ref.
can be studied in ﬁxed – target collisions at the LHC, we will present our predictions considering pP b collisions in
the collider and ﬁxed – target modes of the LHC. In addition, we also will present predictions for P b Ar and P b He
ﬁxed – target collisions. In our analysis we will consider two diﬀerent models for the description of the pentaquark
production in photon – proton interactions, which allow us to estimate the model dependence of our predictions. As
we will show below, our results indicate that the study of the J/Ψ photoproduction in ﬁxed – target collisions can be
useful to probe the existence of the pentaquark states.

Initially we present a brief review of the formalism need to describe the J/Ψ photoproduction in pP b collisions. In

these collisions, both hadrons act as a source of almost real photons, with the equivalent photon ﬂux associated to
the nucleus being enhanced by a factor Z 2 in comparison to the proton one. Consequently, in a ultraperipheral pP b
collision, where b > Rp + RP b, the photon-induced interactions become dominant and the total hadronic cross section
for the J/Ψ production can be expressed in terms of the equivalent ﬂux of photons and the photon – hadron cross

[22], these diﬀerent

In our analysis we will consider that the J/Ψ + p ﬁnal state can be generated by a Pomeron exchange and by a Pc
resonance in the s – channel, as represented in the Figs. 1 (a) and (b), respectively. The contribution associated to
the Pomeron exchange for the γp

In our analysis we will consider the upper values derived in Ref.

The free parameters on the parametrization, σIP and ǫ, are ﬁtted using the HERA data [24], being given by: σIP = 4.06
nb and ǫ = 0.65. In addition, the STARLight MC supplements this cross section by a factor that accounts for its
behavior for energies near the threshold of production. On the other hand, the contribution associated to the Pc
resonance will be described considering two distinct phenomenological models present in the literature [25, 26]. We
[25], denoted Model I hereafter, in which the cross section for the
will consider the model presented in the Ref.
J/Ψp reaction was estimated using the approach proposed
production of the Pc state in the s – channel of the γp
in Refs.
[25], the authors have
constrained the range of values for this quantity using the branching ratios and fractions measured by the LHCb
and GlueX collaborations.
[25], which implies
that the associated predictions should be considered an upper limit for the photoproduction of Pc in ultraperipheral
collisions. In addition, we also will consider the model proposed in Ref. [26], denoted Model II hereafter, where the
photoproduction of the Pc states is estimated within the framework of an eﬀective Lagrangian approach combined
with the vector meson dominance assumption [23]. In this model, the main inputs in the calculations are the partial
decay widths ΓPc→J/Ψp of the diﬀerent Pc states, which determine the electromagnetic couplings related to the γpPc
vertices and gPcJ/Ψp coupling constants. Currently, the value of these quantities are still a theme of debate. Following
Ref. [26], in our calculations using the Model II we will assume that the J/Ψp channel accounts for 3% of total widths
of the Pc states. We refer the reader to the original references [25, 26] for more details about these phenomenological
models for the Pc photoproduction. The resulting predictions of these models for the energy dependence of the
γp
J/Ψp cross section considering the Pomeron exchange and the production of the Pc(4312), Pc(4440) and
Pc(4457) resonances in the s – channel are presented in Fig. 2. The presence of the resonances modiﬁes the energy
4.6 GeV. We found that these models diﬀer in its predictions
dependence of σ(γp
for the impact of the resonances on the cross section, with the Model II predicting a larger contribution associated
to the resonances. For larger and smaller energies, the cross section is dominated by the Pomeron exchange, with
our predictions being similar to those derived in the original references [25, 26], where diﬀerent descriptions of the
Pomeron exchange were considered. As these distinct models have considered the same set of data to constrain its
free parameters, such result is expect.

In what follows we will consider the phenomenological models discussed above as input in our calculations of the
J/Ψ photoproduction in pA collisions. In order to derive our predictions, the STARLight MC was modiﬁed to include
the contribution of the Pc resonances in the description of the energy dependence of the γp
J/Ψp cross section.
Initially, let’s consider pA collisions in the collider mode for the RHIC and LHC energies. For RHIC we will consider
pAu collisions at √s = 0.2 TeV, while for the LHC we will assume pP b collisions at √s = 8.1 TeV. Our predictions
µ+µ− decay are presented in Figs. 3 (a) and
for the rapidity distribution of the dimuons generated in the J/Ψ
(b) for RHIC and LHC energies, respectively. For comparison we present the predictions derived with and without
the inclusion of the Pc resonances, which are denoted IP + Pc and Pomeron, respectively. We have that the rapidity
distribution is asymmetric about midirapidity (yµ+µ−
0) and that the inclusion of the s – channel contribution
implies an enhancement of the rapidity distribution for a given yµ+µ−, with the magnitude of this enhancement
being dependent on the description of the Pc production. Such results are expected. For pA collisions the rapidity
distributions are asymmetric in rapidity due to the asymmetry on the initial photon ﬂuxes associated to a proton
and a nucleus, with the nuclear photon ﬂux being enhanced by a factor Z 2. One important consequence is that the
behaviour of the distribution is dominated by γp interactions with the rapidity directly determining the value of the

Let’s now investigate the Pc photoproduction in ﬁxed – target collisions at the LHC. The study of ﬁxed - target
collisions at the LHC became recently a reality by the injection of noble gases in the LHC beam pipe by the LHCb
Collaboration [29] using the System for Measuring Overlap with Gas (SMOG) device [30]. More results are expected
in forthcoming years [31]. As discussed in detail in Ref. [18], the study of photon - induced interactions is expected
to be possible in ﬁxed - target collisions. In particular, Ref. [18] demonstrated that in ﬁxed – target collisions we will
J/Ψp cross
be able to constrain, in the kinematical range probed by the LHCb detector, the behaviour of the γp
section at low center – of – mass energies, near to the threshold of production. Such results motivate the analysis of
the Pc photoproduction in ﬁxed – target collisions. In our analysis we will assume P bp collisions with √s = 69 GeV,
with the proton being the ﬁxed target. Our results are presented in Fig. 4. For the ﬁxed – target energy, we have that

As the recent studies were performed by injecting the noble gases (He, N e, Ar) in the LHC beam pipe and
similar conﬁgurations should also be present in future analysis, we will extend our previous analysis for the J/Ψ
photoproduction in P b Ar and P b He ﬁxed – target collisions. The predictions are presented in Fig. 5. As in the case
of pP b ﬁxed – target collisions, we predict an enhancement of the rapidity distribution for yµ+µ−
1.8 that is larger
for the Model II than for the Model I. We also predict a second enhancement of the distribution for yµ+µ−

As a summary, in this paper we have investigated the impact of the Pc resonances on the J/Ψ photoproduction
at the RHIC and LHC. We have considered pA collisions at the RHIC and LHC, as well pP b, P b Ar and P b He
ﬁxed – target collisions at the LHC, and estimated the rapidity distributions of the J/Ψ meson taking into account
its decay into a µ+µ− pair. Assuming two models for the description of the Pc production, we have derived upper

limits for the production of diﬀerent Pc states at the LHC. Our goal was to verify if the study of this process can be
useful to conﬁrm the existence of the resonances as well to constrain its properties. We shown that the presence of
J/Ψp cross
the resonances modiﬁes the associated rapidity distribution due to the large enhancement of the γp
section near the threshold. We have demonstrated that in the collider mode, the rapidity distribution is enhanced for
yµ+µ−
7.5, which is beyond of rapidity range covered by the current detectors of the LHC. On the other hand,
in the ﬁxed – target mode, this enhancement is predicted to occur in a rapidity range that can be covered in future
ﬁxed – target studies. Our results indicate that the study of γp interactions at LHC can also provide complementary
and independent checks on the properties of the pentaquark states, and help to understand their underlying nature.
