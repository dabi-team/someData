ABSTRACT

Context. We studied the low-frequency (cid:46) 0.5 h−1 (long-period (cid:38) 2 h) oscillations of active regions (ARs). The investigation is based
on an analysis of a time series built from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) photospheric
magnetograms and comprises case studies of several types of AR structures.
Aims. The main goals are to investigate whether ARs can be engaged in long-period oscillations as uniﬁed oscillatory entities and, if
so, to determine the spectral pattern of such oscillations.
Methods. Time series of characteristic parameters of the ARs, such as, the total area, total unsigned radial magnetic ﬂux, and tilt
angle, were measured and recorded using the image moment method. The power spectra were built out of Gaussian-apodised and
zero-padded datasets.
Results. There are long-period oscillations ranging from 2 to 20 h, similarly to the characteristic lifetimes of super-granulation,
determined from the datasets of the AR total area and radial magnetic ﬂux, respectively. However, no periodicity in tilt angle data was
found.
Conclusions. Whatever nature these oscillations have, they must be energetically supported by convective motions beneath the solar
surface. The possible interpretations can be related to diﬀerent types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations of the multi-scale
structure of the AR magnetic ﬁeld, which is probably linked with the characteristic turnover timescales of the super-granulation cells.
The presence of oscillations in the radial magnetic ﬂux data may be connected to periodic ﬂux emergence or cancellation processes.

1. Introduction

Active regions (ARs) are areas of strong magnetic ﬁeld concen-
tration visible on the solar surface and in its lower atmosphere.
These are areas of intense and often complex magnetic activity
in which sunspots frequently form. ARs are often related to so-
lar activity; for example, solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections.
The number, the locations, and the sizes of these ARs vary with
time, making ARs valuable indicators or tracers of the magnetic
activity of the Sun. The available high-resolution (both in time
and space) observations vividly show the complexity of the AR
morphology and their intriguing dynamics. One important as-
pect of the observable dynamical properties of ARs and of the

sunspots they contain concerns the huge variety of waves and
oscillations they exhibit. The various oscillatory phenomena can
be classiﬁed in diﬀerent types such as umbral chromospheric os-
cillations with a typical period of three minutes (Chorley et al.
2010; Centeno et al. 2006; Fleck & Schmitz 1991; Kuridze et al.
2009), umbral photospheric oscillations with a typical period
of ﬁve minutes (Thomas et al. 1984; Shergelashvili & Poedts
2005), long-period oscillations with typical periods of several
hours (Dumbadze et al. 2017; Efremov et al. 2007; Goldvarg
et al. 2005), and ultra-long-period oscillations with typical peri-
ods of several days (Khutsishvili et al. 1998; Gopasyuk 2004).
The long-period oscillations in sunspots were discovered both in

radio emission measurements and in magnetic ﬁeld data (Gel-
freikh et al. 2006; Efremov et al. 2007; Solov’ev & Kirichek
2008; Smirnova et al. 2013; Abramov-Maximov et al. 2013).
The ground-based and space-based observations yielded very
similar long-period oscillations of sunspots that conﬁrm the so-
lar nature of these oscillations (Abramov-Maximov et al. 2013;
Nagovitsyn & Nagovitsyna 2011). State-of-the-art, space-based
observational facilities provide data with unprecedented accu-
racy, which encourages both observational and theoretical stud-
ies of the physics behind AR dynamics (Moradi 2012).

The image moment method represents a tool for image pro-
cessing to recognise visual patterns of the image objects and to
characterise their position, size, and orientation (Flusser 2007;
Hu 1962). The invariants are computed using their boundary
shape and interior area, and provide characteristics of an object
to represent its properties (Hu 1962; Prokop & Reeves 1992). Hu
(1962) used the mathematical foundation for two-dimensional
moment invariants to derive seven known invariants with respect
to the rotation of 2D objects. Furthermore, Hu’s moment invari-
ant method has been used in template matching and the regis-
tration of satellite images (e.g. Goshtasby 1985; Flusser & Suk
1994) for character recognition of objects (Belkasim et al. 1991;
Tsirikolias & Mertzios 1993) and in many other applications.

In Dumbadze et al. (2017, hereafter Paper I), we reported
and discussed long-period oscillations in ARs, with periods of
up to several hours. In that paper, we also focused on oscilla-
tions of the tilt angle of the AR’s cross-sectional area. The tilt
angle oscillations were interpreted as the second harmonic of
standing kink modes, assuming the ARs are related to magnetic
ﬂux tubes with feet embedded in the dense plasma of the solar
interior and connected to the lighter (less dense) part of the loop
observed above the surface. We assumed that the related kink
modes have nodes in the apex above the solar surface and that the
ARs oscillate as a whole. This simplifying assumption enabled
us to roughly determine the possible distribution of their phase
speed values along the corresponding magnetic tubes. Our esti-
mations showed that the characteristic depth of the ARs is about
40 000 km, and that below this depth the sunspots are presum-
ably fragmented into smaller magnetic tube structures as was
suggested by Parker (1979).

The analysis presented here is in some sense a continuation
of the previous phenomenological study of ARs reported in Pa-
per I. The objective of the present paper is to more systemati-
cally examine the existence of the oscillations in diﬀerent types
of ARs. For this purpose, we performed a set of case studies for
typical ARs along their transit across the solar disk, which were
selected according to their morphological structure. The remain-
der of this paper is organised as follows: the observations of the
ARs and the data processing methods are described in Sect. 2.
Section 3 is dedicated to the analysis of the signiﬁcant peri-
ods discovered. The discussion and conclusions are presented
in Sect. 4.

disk. The observational time span is chosen so that we observe
the transition of the ARs from roughly −70◦ to +70◦ longitude.

We used data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) (Schou et al.
2012; Scherrer et al. 2012). The line-of-sight magnetogram
(BLOS ) dataset of 45 s cadence was used for the systematic in-
vestigation of active region long-period oscillatory patterns. The
projection eﬀects were corrected using the ’mtrack’ algorithm
in the SDO/HMI ring-diagram pipeline (Bogart et al. 2011a,b),
which employs the azimuthal equidistant (Postel) projection.
This involves a mapped rectangular frame following the AR at
selected heliographic coordinates and tracks it during the time
interval with the Carrington rotation rate. Also, we considered all
three components of the magnetic ﬁeld (i.e. radial Br, meridional
Bθ, and azimuthal Bϕ), which were obtained from Space-weather
HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP, Bobra et al. (2014)), avail-
able as sharp_cea_720s data with a cadence rate of 720 s. For
these data, the projection eﬀects were corrected using cylindri-
cal equal-area mapping.

2. Observations and data processing methodology

2.2. Generation of time series

2.1. Observational data

The aim of the study reported here is to reveal temporal oscil-
latory patterns in the datasets related to a number of ARs. We
carried out case studies for the ﬁve ARs that are shown in Fig. 1.
The list of these ﬁve studied ARs with some of their properties is
also given in Table 1. During the selection of these speciﬁc ARs,
we paid attention to their sizes, shapes, and locations on the solar

As mentioned before, we used the image moment method to pro-
cess the obtained series of rectangular frames described in the
previous sub-section. The standard procedure implies a transfor-
mation of the original BLOS magnetograms (or Br, Bθ and Bϕ)
into unsigned binary images of the ARs using certain thresholds
for each of them (cf. last column of Table 1). For each of the
diﬀerent ARs, the value of the threshold is chosen individually
from the ± 300 − 400 G range (see Table 1) so that the spurious

small magnetic features around the AR are ﬁltered out, while the
principal components of the AR body remain visible, and more
or less unchanged throughout the observational time span. These
thresholds are kept the same within the duration of observation
for a given AR. After the implementation of thresholding and
binary imaging procedures, the binary snapshots were used for
the calculation of the image moments. The moments of invari-
ants are characterised with their two-dimensional (p + q)th order
deﬁned by Hu (1962):

(cid:34)

Mpq =

xpyqI(x, y) dx dy,

(1)

where p, q = 0, 1, 2, ...; x and y are the coordinates of the pixel
in the respective scaling; I(x, y) denotes the binary rate (set of
active pixels) of the unsigned magnetic ﬁeld. For clarity with re-
gard to the analysis, we introduce the notation for total areas as
Di (i = BLOS , Br, Bθ or Bϕ), which are deﬁned by the correspond-
ing unsigned magnetic ﬁeld binary rate I.

For the analysis, we use the discretised counterpart of

Eq. (1):

Mpq =

(cid:88)

active pixels

xpyqI(x, y),

(2)

where I(x, y) represents the mentioned discrete binary rate of
BLOS (or Br, Bθ, Bϕ). In this case, the zeroth-order moment in-
variant M00 determines the area of the object measured in the
pixel areas. We can also calculate the principal axes of the object
(Hu 1962) using the ﬁrst- and second-order moment invariants.
Here, the principal axes of the object correspond to the major
and minor axes of the AR. The inclination of the AR major axis
with respect to the equatorial line of the solar disk, which is iden-
tiﬁed as the tilt angle of the major axis (the largest principal axis
of the object), can be derived using the ﬁrst- and second-order
moments of the image object:
θ = 1

.

Using the sequence of snapshots within the observational time
span, we thus produced time series for the tilt angles and the
total areas of the studied ARs, and this for all components of the
magnetic ﬁeld. In addition, we produced time series of the total
unsigned radial magnetic ﬂux, determined as

(cid:88)

|Φ| =

|Br(x, y)|S (x, y),

(4)

where Br(x, y) is the radial magnetic ﬁeld component in each
active pixel identiﬁed by the corresponding binary image, and
S (x, y) = 1.33 × 105 km2 is the area covered by these pixels
on the solar surface corresponding to the cylindrical equal area
remapping (Bobra et al. 2014).

2.3. Data pre-processing

We focussed our study on long-period (> 2 h) (low-frequency)
oscillation signals with a satisfactory level of conﬁdence. Fur-
ther discussion reveals that such periodicities are seen in the
Fourier spectra of the considered time series. However, they are
’drenched’ in the background power-law noise, making it diﬃ-
cult to prove the signiﬁcance of the detected periods. Therefore,
in order to elaborate the characteristic periods with a satisfactory
level of conﬁdence and to distinguish the real quasi-oscillations
in the time series from artefacts, we used three diﬀerent methods
for the period detection:

2.3.1. Method 1 (M1) – Power spectra of the datasets

Vaughan (2005) suggested a method that ﬁnds signiﬁcant peaks
on top of the power-law noise and calculates their uncertainties.
We applied this method to our datasets to ﬁnd signiﬁcant
peaks in the power spectra,
implying the following steps.
(i) De-trending and apodisating the initial data (as described in
Appendix A, items 1 and 2). (ii) Computing of the periodograms
of the detrended and apodised datasets; and along with this,
we omit the power of the Nyquist frequency following the
recipe given in Vaughan (2005) and convert
the frequency
( f ) and power (W) into log-space (see example in Fig. C.1).
(iii) Making a linear model ﬁt (lg Wmodel = m lg f + b) of the
obtained power spectrum in log-scale (cf. solid blue lines in
Fig. C.1). (iv) Determining the residuals of the computed power
from the model line assuming that they follow the second
order two-dimensional chi-square (χ2
2) distribution as a null
hypothesis. In particular, we test the goodness of the model with
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test (Press et al. 2007). When
the KS test does not satisfy the null hypothesis, we adjust the
slope m and the oﬀset b until the test is fulﬁlled. (v) Estimating
the 95% probability limit γe by assuming that the noise is two-
dimensional χ2 distributed following Eq. (16) from Vaughan
(2005) and using the computed m and b coeﬃcients (we also
plot this conﬁdence limit into log-space; cf. dashed red lines in
Fig. C.1). (vi) Selecting the signiﬁcant peak of the lowest fre-
quency (longest period) in the spectrum and comparing it with
similar period of the sinusoidal ﬁtting function A1 sin(A2t + A3)
applied to the considered initial dataset (for further details, we
refer the reader to Appendix A). The corresponding peak is then
removed from the power spectrum by directly subtracting the
found model sine function from the dataset. (vii) Steps (ii)-(v)
are iteratively repeated until all outstanding peaks are removed
from the spectrum, and a pure power-law noise remains.

2.3.2. Method 2 (M2) – Re-binned power spectra of the

datasets

In order to enhance signiﬁcant peaks in the power spectrum,
we used the spectral re-binning method (Appourchaux 2003).
Pugh et al. (2017) showed how the Vaughan (2005) method
can be updated for use with re-binned power spectra. They
used this method for solar and stellar ﬂare datasets to determine
quasi-periodic pulsations. We used the same method and
proceeded with the following steps: (i) performing steps (i) and
(ii) of M1; (ii) compute the sum of consecutive p frequency
bins using the original power spectrum and then divide it by p
(in our calculations we use p = 2); (iii) repeat steps (iii)-(iv)
of M1 (however, for the description of the noise distribution,
instead of a two-dimensional χ2
2 distribution function, we used
a 2p-dimensional distribution function χ2
2p (Pugh et al. 2017);
then, the corresponding 95% conﬁdence line is estimated and
plotted accordingly); (iv) repeat steps (vi)-(vii) of M1 (see
example in Fig. C.1).

2.3.3. Method 3 (M3) – Average power spectra for four
consecutive equal parts (time windows) of entire
observational time

In order to provide additional proof of the presence of the dis-
covered signiﬁcant periods in the signal, we used a third method.
It is based on the division of the total observational time span in
four equivalent mutually non-overlapping intervals of time, and
we derived the power spectra for each of these intervals. Con-
sidering the shorter datasets, we sacriﬁce the spectral resolution
(the uncertainties increase by a factor four compared to the ﬁrst
two methods) and, in this case, the noise no longer follows a chi-
squared distribution. However, we are able to generate the ’av-
eraged’ Fourier power spectrum out of these four observational
windows.

The analysis steps of M3 are as follows. (i) Divide the
analysed time series into four equivalent non-overlapping parts.
(ii) Compute the power spectrum of each individual part, as de-
scribed in step (ii) of M1. (iii) Sum the four power spectra ob-
tained. The peaks revealed by M1 and M2 are ’real’ if they still
remain in the summed spectrum, while the spurious ones disap-
pear (see example in Fig. C.1). Then, we apply the same proce-
dures as those outlined in steps (iii)-(vii) of M1 again.

Both methods M1 and M2 enable us to isolate the individual
periods of oscillations with a spectral accuracy of approximately
the same magnitude. The purpose of using these two diﬀerent
methods is to cross-check the validity of the discovered signif-
icant peaks. Thus, we are able to compare the periods obtained
from these two main methods and evaluate their average values.
Strictly speaking, however, these two methods of measurement
are not completely independent of each other. Therefore, when
we calculate the mean values of the periods, including measure-
ments of areas and ﬂuxes related to particular components of the
magnetic ﬁeld obtained by one of the two methods and cross
conﬁrmed by them where possible, the aim is not to demonstrate
the statistical mean of the mutually independent ensemble of the
measurements (according to its classical deﬁnition). Instead, we
use the average values just as a method of approximation to eval-
uate the globally averaged values we discovered. With regard to
the errors, the simple averaging of uncertainties, when we take
the arithmetic mean of measurements, is not consistent. In partic-
ular, it is not consistent in the case when the methods of measure-
ments are not completely independent of each other. Therefore,
we choose the uncertainty approximation method in order to be
prudent with the assumption that the uncertainty of the mean of
two measurements cannot be larger than the maximum error of
each individual method; hence, whenever we use the maximum
uncertainties. Additionally, M3 enables the veriﬁcation and con-
ﬁrmation (with a reduced but still reasonable accuracy) of the
characteristic periods inferred by the main methods, M1 and M2,
where possible. This yields the maximal robustness of the anal-
ysis that can be achieved.

3. Analysis and comparison of spectra for different

cases

3.1. Revealing of major periodicities

We study the long-period (> 2 h) oscillatory patterns in ARs
with four diﬀerent typical morphological structures (e.g. follow-
ing the classiﬁcation given in Jaeggli & Norton 2016). The con-
sidered periods are obtained from the Fourier spectra of the time
series, which have certain (limited) observational time spans and
sampling rates. The characteristic parameters of these datasets

Article number, page 4 of 12

determine the period resolution and the overall accuracy of the
obtained power spectra. As a result, some signiﬁcant periods in
the spectra are embedded in strong background noise showing a
power-law nature (see Appendix C). We do not attempt to pro-
vide a physical interpretation of the mechanism(s) that might be
responsible for the appearance of these oscillatory patterns. In-
stead, we give a few plausible indications concerning the pos-
sible scenarios. The ﬁnal interpretation of the detected oscilla-
tions requires the construction of rigorous mathematical models,
and this is beyond the scope of the present, purely observational,
study. The results of the performed analysis for each considered
AR are summarised in Tables B.1-B.4 (see Appendix B).

Most of the periodic features are revealed for DBLOS . How-
ever, the analysis of the estimated DBr , DBθ and DBϕ and the total
unsigned radial magnetic ﬂux yield a smaller number of detected
signiﬁcant periods. In most cases, the values of these periods are
similar to those in DBLOS .

Tables B.1-B.4 show that each AR yields a diﬀerent number
of modes, and further investigations with more ARs are needed
to verify the dependence of the number of oscillation modes on
the morphology. Another ﬁnding is that long periods (> 10 h)
are detected less frequently than the shorter periods (< 10 h) in
all analysed datasets. The apparent reason for this is the gradual
reduction of the spectral resolution with the growth of the peri-
ods. We know also that the longest period parts of the spectra
are contaminated by two artiﬁcial instrumental peaks at 12 and
24 h (Liu et al. 2012), which might cause spectral power leak-
age and mixture between real, long periods and artiﬁcial spec-
tral peaks. Presumably, these artiﬁcial signals have less impact
on the part of the spectrum below 10 h. Altogether, we show
that in all datasets there are long-period oscillations with char-
acteristic periods in the range from 2 to 20 h (beyond 20 h,
the derived spectra are rather unreliable because of a very large
uncertainty), which are similar to the characteristic lifetimes of
super-granulation (Rincon & Rieutord 2018). So, it is intuitive to
connect the observed oscillation periods with the characteristic
turnover times of super-granulation cells.

None of the applied analysis methods described in Sect. 2.3
gave us any signiﬁcant periodicities in the AR major axis tilt an-
gle data. Therefore, we assume that the power spectrum for this
quantity does not contain signiﬁcant periods and it remains of a
pure power-law type. At the same time, we would like to note
that this non-detection does not mean that tilt angle oscillations
do not exist, because the uncertainty tolerance of the image mo-
ment method used here, does not allow for suﬃcient conﬁdence
of such oscillations. The diﬀerence between this result and that
discussed in Paper I can be related to the methodology of the
analysis. In particular, the method discussed in Paper I, identiﬁes
the principal axis of the AR and its tilt on the basis of the least-
squares ﬁtting of its elliptical shape. While with the method of
image moments used in the present paper, the tilt angle θ (Eq. 3)
is deﬁned in terms of zeroth-, ﬁrst-, and second-order moments
of each image, which probably produces more noise in the tilt
angle datasets. Thus, the noise might overwhelm the oscillation
amplitude itself. Of course, a more precise analysis of this diﬀer-
ence requires a thorough cross-comparison of the two methods
of measurements.

The radial unsigned magnetic ﬂux shows some signiﬁcant
periodicities (see Table B.4) for all ARs, comparably to those of
the area oscillations (see Tables B.1-B.3). For example, the os-
cillations with periods of about 6 and 4 h are the most frequently
detected ones. They are conﬁrmed, with some exceptions, by the
two main methods M1 and M2, as well as being additionally
proven by M3 (with some discrepancy tolerated by the error of

M3 are excluded from the total mean calculation) via the solid-coloured horizontal lines (with the uncertainties indicated by the dashed coloured
lines). The colour scheme follows the sequence of quasi-harmonics described in Sect. 3.2 and also corresponds to the colouring used in the tables

ﬂux oscillations in practically all ARs. The frequent presence of
the six- and four-hour periods both in area and radial magnetic
ﬂux datasets may be connected with periodic ﬂux emergence or
cancellation processes, which can be another possible compo-

nent of the physical scenario behind the observed dynamic pic-
ture.

3.2. Possible interpretation as a signature of quasi-standing

oscillation patterns

Our analysis enables the detection of a discrete spectrum of
signiﬁcant periods. Tables B.1-B.4 (in Appendix B) show that
the particular and averaged periods measured by various meth-
ods are grouped in the following ranges: (i) ’harmonic’ P1 –
17.1 ± 0.71 − 17.4 ± 0.74 h (marked in cyan), (ii) ’harmonic’ P2 –
7.66 ± 0.14 − 9.54 ± 0.90 h (marked in magenta), (iii) ’harmonic’
P3 – 5.69 ± 0.08 − 6.37 ± 0.10 h (marked in red), (iv) ’harmonic’
P4 – 4.45 ± 0.19 − 4.88 ± 0.23 h (marked in green), and (v) ’har-
monic’ P5 – 3.66 ± 0.03 − 3.88 ± 0.05 h (marked in blue). In
Fig. 2, we plot all these period groups together. In Fig. 3, we
show the ratios of the average periods from each group in the
same sequence as in Fig. 2. For the calculation of the uncertain-
ties found in the period ratios, we use the following relation:

where Pi > Pi+1 (i = 1, 2, . . . is the number of ’harmonics’) are
the global and total mean periods (see deﬁnition of these terms in
the caption of Fig. 2) evaluated for each AR. They sequentially
follow each other in descending order. One can see that the ra-
tios of the averaged periods resemble the sequence of oscillation
harmonics (Fig. 3) typical for a standing oscillations. The latter
are shown with black solid horizontal lines as the reference val-
ues of the ratios. We note that the observed ratios do not exactly
coincide with the sequence of ratios of periods corresponding to
pure standing oscillations (2/1, 3/2, 4/3, . . .). Nevertheless, the
observed ratios with the entire uncertainty interval are well sep-
arated and approximately follow the reference spectrum ratios.
Hence, with the present level of accuracy we can say that the ob-
served discrete spectrum follows the sequence of quasi-standing
oscillations still showing some shift of the periods and corre-
sponding ratios from the reference values. This shift of periods
might be due to the incomplete line-tying of the magnetic loop
system, Doppler shifts due to the internal ﬂows in ARs, and/or
the inhomogeneity of the magnetic loop system constituting the
AR below and above the solar surface. The presence of the struc-
tures in the emerged magnetic ﬁelds with power-law-distributed
spatial scales is well known and actively used in sand-pile mod-
els of ﬂares (see Baiesi et al. (2008) and references therein). The
formation of such transfer structures can be ascribed to non-
equilibrium statistical process of driven diﬀusion (Maes et al.
2009) of the emerged elements of the magnetic ﬂux.

4. Discussion and conclusions

One can link the discovered periods with the characteris-
tic turnover timescale of the super-granulation cells, which is
known to be of the same order of magnitude. Another possible
interpretation can be related to the diﬀerent types of MHD oscil-
lations of the multi-scale structure of the AR magnetic ﬁeld. It
is well known that the MHD oscillations and waves sustained in
structures with non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld can be engaged in the
processes of resonant (Terradas et al. 2008) or swing (Sherge-
lashvili et al. 2005) absorption. It is evident that, whatever nature
these oscillations have, they must be energetically supported by
convective motions beneath the solar surface, which represents
the source of entropy production in the system through macro-
scopic stochastic super-granular motions of the plasma. The en-
tropy variations can be due to microscopic transport processes
as well (Shergelashvili et al. 2007). The presence of oscillations

in the radial magnetic ﬂux data may be connected with a pe-
riodic ﬂux emergence/cancellation process. One could interpret
some parts of the discovered spectra in terms of sequences of
quasi-standing eigen-oscillations with a full or partial line-tying
conﬁguration of the magnetic structures. The MHD oscillations
can be also driven by convective turbulence. To conﬁrm which
of these scenarios prevails, further dedicated studies are needed.
In the very simple set-up we considered in Paper I, we inter-
preted the oscillations of the major and minor axis lengths of the
ellipses we used to frame the ARs as higher (than sausage mode)
degree ﬂute modes. However, this interpretation was rather intu-
itive and speculative. The goal of the current work is to reveal the
basic spectral characteristic of the oscillations that will be used
in the next work for a more rigorous modelling. The compari-
son of the theoretical model with the observed spectra discussed
here will enable us to draw deﬁnite conclusions about the na-
ture of these oscillations. According to our preliminary results
in Paper I, one can intuitively expect that the large period oscil-
lations should be related to the modes with phase speeds compa-
rable to the Alfvén velocity in the high-beta plasma in sunspots.
Another general conclusion can be that, whatever nature these
modes have, if for some reason there is a line-tying at some depth
enabling the presence of nodes for velocity or pressure perturba-
tions, then such discrete spectra with ﬁxed sequences of period
ratios can be formed. Since we plan further theoretical investiga-
tions of the issue, we avoided any speculations about the physical
nature of the observed periodicities in the present paper, with an
ultimate goal of simply addressing the observational facts; that
is to say, the oscillation spectra observed in the range of 2 − 20 h
periods. Concerning the pure standing oscillations, these would
occur when the ratios of the periods of all overtones strictly fol-
lowing the sequence 2/1, 3/2, 4/3, . . .. The reason why the ratios
diﬀer form the reference spectrum requires investigation. Most
likely, the inhomogeneity along the ﬂux tubes causes this eﬀect,
as it does in coronal loops (Andries et al. 2009). Nevertheless,
our results indicate that the ratios of the detected periods roughly
follow the reference spectrum (shown on the ordinate axis of
Fig. 3); however, they still deviate from it somewhat. This might
be caused by the uncertainty tolerance we admit in our measure-
ments and the foot point leakage of modes (not complete line-
tying) or their combination.

Appendix A: Data processing details

For the application of original, re-binned and windowed power
spectra to the analysed datasets, we use data de-trending, apodi-
sation, signiﬁcant peak identiﬁcation, and removal by sine func-
tion ﬁtting, which are speciﬁed below.

3. Take the remaining dataset, after the subtraction of the
largest periodic signal found, as a new dataset and apply
steps (1) and (2) to identify and extract the next longest pe-
riod. These iterations are repeated until the shortest period of
interest is detected and extracted.

Appendix A.1: Data de-trending and preparation for different

Appendix B: Tables

Here, we present the tables that summarise the signiﬁcant peri-
ods obtained from the total area variation in time correspond-
ing to AR 12378, AR 12381, AR 12435, AR 12437, and AR
12524 (see Tables B.1-B.3). The ﬁrst columns of these tables
show the periods obtained by the power spectra of the datasets
(M1). The second columns indicate the periods detected by the
method using the re-binned power spectra of the datasets (M2).
The third columns indicate the averaged periods calculated based
on the results of M1 and M2, and the last columns denote the
outcome of average power spectra for four consecutive equal
parts of entire observational time (M3). All periods and uncer-
tainties shown in the tables are expressed in hours. The colours
correspond to the colour-coding of the period groups described
in Sect. 3.2.

In addition, we provide Table B.4, which contains similar
periodicities inferred from the total radial magnetic ﬂux of all
considered ARs. The average characteristic parameters of the
oscillations, derived from the content of these tables, are visu-
alised in Fig. 2, while the ratios of the derived global and total
mean periods are plotted in Fig. 3. When multiple peaks occur
in one particular method only, while a single isolated one is de-
tected in other methods, we calculate the weighted mean of the
frequency and deﬁne them as ’multiplets’. Accordingly, we as-
sume that such multiplets do not carry real physical information,
but they simply represent spurious artefacts related to analysis
accuracy.

Appendix C: Example eigenspectra

Here, we provide an example of the eigenspectra of the AR
12381 area. Fig. C.1 shows the obtained frequency spectra for
AR 12381 with all three methods that are shown with the de-
tected peaks, as well as the 12-hour artefact frequencies (Liu
et al. 2012).

spectral methods

Data processing begins with our obtaining time series using
the method described in Sect. 2.2 of image moments dealing
with the selected values of magnetic ﬁeld thresholds for individ-
ual ARs. However, apart from the stochastic and quasi-periodic
parts, the initial data include aperiodic trends with a characteris-
tic timescale of variation equal to the total observation time. We
remove these aperiodic variations by subtracting a third-order
polynomial function ﬁtted to the original data. Furthermore, as
mentioned in Sect. 2.1, for 45-second cadence data of BLOS we
use Postel’s equidistant projection mapping. Additionally, we
used 720-second cadence data from the Joint Science Operations
Center (JSOC, Sun (2013); Hoeksema et al. (2014)). The latter
data are de-projected by using cylindrical equal area mapping
for radial Br, meridional Bθ and azimuthal Bϕ components of
the magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, the projection eﬀect related to the
spherical shape of the Sun is removed from the magnetogram
image data.

Appendix A.2: Data apodisation

We perform a Gaussian apodisation of the de-trended data to re-
duce the eﬀect of ﬁniteness of the total sampling time. The pro-
cedure implies multiplication of the original datasets by a Gaus-
sian function of the following form:

w(n) = e− 1

2

(cid:16)
α 2n
(N−1)

(cid:17)2

,

(A.1)

where N is total number of sample points, while the integer n is
varying in the range −(N − 1)/2 ≤ n ≤ (N − 1)/2, and the param-
eter α controls the shape of the Gaussian. For all area datasets of
ARs 12381, 12435, 12437, and 12524, for DBLOS of AR 12378,
and for the radial ﬂux datasets of ARs 12381, 12435, and 12524,
we use α = 3. For the remaining datasets, we use α = 2. These α
values were chosen for each AR separately by gradually increas-
ing it until we obtain the value for which any further increase
does not show any further signiﬁcant aﬀect on the obtained spec-
trum.

Appendix A.3: Signiﬁcant peak identiﬁcation

To identify the signiﬁcant peaks using this method, we take the
following steps:

1. Perform a regression of the dataset on the sum of sine func-
tions. We choose the number of terms in this sum depending
on the best regression goodness and detect the one with the
longest period (with its amplitude, angular frequency, and
phase).

2. Test the relevance of the periods found, analysing an auto-
correlation function of the de-trended datasets, by taking its
power spectra and making sure that the period deduced di-
rectly in step (1) is indeed present in the spectrum. Then
this term is subtracted from the original dataset which al-
most completely removes the longest oscillation period from
the signal.
