White dwarfs are compact stars, similar in size to Earth but
Isolated white dwarfs emit most of their power from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths,
but when in close orbits with less dense stars, white dwarfs can strip material from their com-
panions, and the resulting mass transfer can generate atomic line2 and X-ray3 emission, as
well as near- and mid-infrared radiation if the white dwarf is magnetic4. However, even in bi-
naries, white dwarfs are rarely detected at far-infrared or radio frequencies. Here we report

the discovery of a white dwarf / cool star binary that emits from X-ray to radio wavelengths.
The star, AR Scorpii (henceforth AR Sco), was classiﬁed in the early 1970s as a δ-Scuti star5,
a common variety of periodic variable star. Our observations reveal instead a 3.56 hr period
close binary, pulsing in brightness on a period of 1.97 min. The pulses are so intense that
AR Sco’s optical ﬂux can increase by a factor of four within 30 s, and they are detectable
at radio frequencies, the ﬁrst such detection for any white dwarf system. They reﬂect the
spin of a magnetic white dwarf which we ﬁnd to be slowing down on a 107 yr timescale. The
spin-down power is an order of magnitude larger than that seen in electromagnetic radia-
tion, which, together with an absence of obvious signs of accretion, suggests that AR Sco is
primarily spin-powered. Although the pulsations are driven by the white dwarf’s spin, they
originate in large part from the cool star. AR Sco’s broad-band spectrum is characteristic
of synchrotron radiation, requiring relativistic electrons. These must either originate from
near the white dwarf or be generated in situ at the M star through direct interaction with the
white dwarf’s magnetosphere.

AR Sco’s brightness varies on a 3.56 h period (Fig. 1a); it was this that caused the δ-Scuti
classiﬁcation5. The scatter visible in Fig. 1a prompted us to take optical photometry with the high-
speed camera ULTRACAM6. These data and follow-up observations taken in the ultraviolet and
near-infrared (Extended Data Table 1) all show strong double-humped pulsations on a fundamental
period of 1.97 min (Figs 2 and 3); the scatter in Fig.1a is the result of the pulsations. Most unusually
of all, an hour-long observation at radio frequencies with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) also shows the pulsations (Figs 2d, 2e and 3d). The pulse fraction, (fmax
fmin)/(fmax +
fmin), exceeds 95 % in the far ultraviolet (Fig. 2), and is still 10 % at 9 GHz in the radio. Only in
X-rays did we not detect pulses (pulse fraction < 30 % at 99.7 % conﬁdence). AR Sco’s optical
magnitude (g(cid:48)) varies from 16.9 at its faintest to 13.6 at its peak, a factor of 20 in ﬂux.

We acquired optical spectra which show a cool M-type main-sequence star (Extended Data
Fig. 1) with absorption lines that change radial velocity sinusoidally on the 3.56 h period with
4) km s−1 (Fig. 1b; we use subscripts “1” and “2” to indicate the com-
amplitude K2 = (295
pact star and the M star respectively). The 3.56 h period is therefore the orbital period of a close
binary star. The M star’s radial velocity amplitude sets a lower limit on the mass of its compan-
0.016) M(cid:12). The compact object is not visible in the spectra, consistent
ion of M1
with either a white dwarf or a neutron star, the only two types of object which can both support
a misaligned magnetic dipole and spin fast enough to match the pulsations. The optical and ul-
traviolet spectra show atomic emission lines (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2) which originate from
the side of the M star facing the compact object (Extended Data Fig. 3). Their velocity ampli-
tude relative to the M star sets a lower limit upon the mass ratio q = M2/M1 > 0.35 (Extended
Data Fig. 4). This, along with the requirement that the M star ﬁts within its Roche lobe, deﬁnes
mass ranges for each star of 0.81 M(cid:12) < M1 <
0.45 M(cid:12). The

M star’s spectral type (M5) suggests that its mass lies at the lower end of the allowed range for
M2. Assuming that the M star is close to its Roche lobe, its brightness leads to a distance estimate
d = (M2/0.3 M(cid:12))1/3(116

16) pc.

±

The amplitude spectra of the pulsations show the presence of two components of similar
frequency (Fig. 3). Using our own monitoring and archival optical data spanning 7 years7, we
measured precise values for the frequencies of these components, ﬁnding their difference to be
within 20 parts per million of the orbital frequency, νO (Extended Data Figs 5 and 6, Extended
Data Table 2). The natural interpretation is that the higher frequency component represents the
spin frequency νS of the compact star (PS = 1.95 min), while its lower frequency and generally
stronger counterpart is a re-processed or “beat” frequency νB = νS
νO (PB = 1.97 min), assuming
that the compact star spins in the same sense as the binary orbit.

AR Sco emits across the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 4, Extended Data Table 3), and,
in the infrared and radio in particular, is orders of magnitudes brighter than the thermal emission
from its component stars represented by model atmospheres8,9 in Fig. 4.
Integrating over the
spectral energy distribution (SED) shown in Fig. 4 and adopting a distance of 116 pc, we ﬁnd a
1025 W and a mean of ¯L
1025 W, well in excess of the

1024 W. The two possible sources
combined luminosities of the stellar components L(cid:63) = 4.4

and its time derivative. Using the archival optical data we measured the spin frequency to be

RWD = 0.01 R(cid:12)), this leads to L ˙ν(NS) = 1.1

this shows that spin-down luminosity is sufﬁcient to power the system if the compact object is
a white dwarf but not if it is a neutron star. Accretion is the only possible power source in the

The observations point toward a white dwarf as the compact object. First, AR Sco’s distance
of 116 pc is an order of magnitude closer than the nearest accreting neutron star known, Cen X-
410, but typical of white dwarf / main-sequence binaries (closer systems are known11). Second,
1023 W, is only 4 % of the largely-optical luminosity
AR Sco’s X-ray luminosity, LX = 4.9
excess, L+. By contrast, the X-ray luminosities of accreting neutron stars are typically 100 times

their optical luminosities12. Third, at PS = 1.95 min, AR Sco has a spin period an order of magni-
tude longer than any (neutron star powered) radio pulsar known13. Finally, the upper limit masses
M1 = 1.29 M(cid:12) and M2 = 0.45 M(cid:12) are simultaneously low for a neutron star but high for an M5
M star. A 0.8 M(cid:12) white dwarf with a 0.3 M(cid:12) M dwarf is a more natural pairing.

AR Sco’s observational properties are unique. It may represent an evolutionary stage of a
class of stars known as intermediate polars (IPs), which feature spinning magnetic white dwarfs
accreting from low-mass stars in close binaries14. Only one IP, AE Aquarii (AE Aqr), has a broad-
band SED similar to AR Sco15 and comparably strong radio emission16, although it shows no
radio pulsations17 (< 0.8 %) and its 0.4 % optical pulsations compare with 70 % in AR Sco. With
a 25 % pulse fraction, even the IP with the strongest-known optical pulsations, FO Aquarii18, falls
well short of AR Sco. A key difference is perhaps the lack of signiﬁcant accretion in AR Sco
compared to the IPs. This can be seen from its X-ray luminosity which is less than 1 % of the X-
ray luminosity of a typical IP19, but above all from its optical and ultraviolet emission lines which
come entirely from the irradiated face of the M star. IPs by contrast show Doppler-broadened line
emission, often from accretion discs, and even AE Aqr, which is in an unusual “propeller” state in
which transferred matter is expelled upon encountering the magnetosphere of its rapidly-spinning
PS = 33 s white dwarf20,21, shows broad and stochastically variable line emission. We can ﬁnd
no analogue of AR Sco’s radio properties. Pulsed radio emission has been detected from brown
dwarfs and M stars22,23, but the broad-band nature of AR Sco’s emission, its short pulsation period,
and lack of circular polarisation (our ATCA data constrain it to < 10 %), distinguish it from these
sources.

The white dwarf in AR Sco is currently spinning down on a timescale τ = ν/ ˙ν = 107 yr.
White dwarfs are not born spinning rapidly24, and a prior stage of accretion-driven spin-up is
required. Depending upon the distance at which the accreting material coupled to the white dwarf’s
magnetic ﬁeld, between 0.002 M(cid:12) and 0.015 M(cid:12) of matter are required to reach PS = 1.95 min.
For an accretion rate of 10−9 M(cid:12) yr−1, typical of similar period systems, this takes from 2
107 yr
108 yr. Both spin-up and spin-down timescales are much shorter than the likely age of the
to 1.5
109 yr25. Thus we could be seeing
system: the cooling age of the white dwarf alone exceeds 1.2
one of many such episodes in AR Sco’s history. There is empirical evidence for similar cycling of
accretion rate in both white dwarf26,27 and neutron star binary systems28,29. If so, since the spin-up
and spin-down timescales are similar in magnitude, there would be a good chance of catching the
spin-down phase.

AR Sco’s extremely broad-band SED is indicative of synchrotron emission from relativistic
electrons. A signiﬁcant fraction appears to come from the cool M star. We infer this from the
dominant beat frequency component that in the absence of accretion can only come from the M

1/40th of the sky as seen from the white dwarf, while the spin-
star. Since the M star occupies
11.5 times the mean electromagnetic power, this requires a mechanism to
down luminosity is
transfer energy from the white dwarf to the M dwarf which is more than 40/11.5 = 3.5 times more
efﬁcient than the interception of isotropically-emitted radiation. At the same time, direct pulsed
emission from the white dwarf must not overwhelm the re-processed component. Two possibilities
are collimated fast particle outﬂows and direct interaction of the white dwarf’s magnetosphere with
the M dwarf, but the exact emission mechanism operative in AR Sco is perhaps its most mysterious
feature.

Data sources. AR Sco’s location in the ecliptic plane, not far from the Galactic centre and only
2.5◦ North-West of the centre of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, means that it appears in many
archival observations. It is detected in the FIRST 21 cm radio survey30, the Two Micron All Sky
Survey (2MASS)31, the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS)7, and in the Herschel, WISE and Spitzer in-
frared satellite archives32,33,34. Useful upper limits come from non-detections in the Australia
Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) survey35 and the WISH survey36. Flux measurements, ranges (when
time resolved data are available) and upper limits from these sources are listed in Extended Data
Table 3.

We supplemented these data with our own intensive observations on a variety of telescopes
and instruments, namely: the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope (VLT) with the FORS and X-SHOOTER
optical/NIR spectrographs and the HAWK-I NIR imager; the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope
(WHT) with the ISIS spectrograph and the ULTRACAM high-speed camera6; the 2.5 m Isaac
Newton Telescope (INT) with the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS); the 2.4 m Thai
National Telescope with the ULTRASPEC high-speed camera37; the UV/optical and X-ray instru-
ments UVOT and XRT on the Swift satellite; the COS UV spectrograph on the Hubble Space
Telescope, HST; radio observations on the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Opti-
cal monitoring data came from a number of small telescopes. We include here data taken with a
406 mm telescope at the Remote Observatory Atacama Desert (ROAD) in San Pedro de Atacama38.
Extended Data Table 1 summarises these observations.

The orbital, spin and beat frequencies. The orbital, spin and beat frequencies were best mea-
sured from the small-telescope data because of their large time-base. For example, see the ampli-
tude spectrum around the spin/beat components of the clear ﬁlter data from 19–28 July 2015 shown
in Extended Data Fig. 5. The ﬁnal frequencies, which give the dashed lines of Extended Data
Fig. 5, were obtained from the CSS data. These consisted of 305 exposures each 30-seconds in
duration spanning the interval 30 May 2006 until 8 July 2013. We rejected 6 points which lay more
than 4σ from the multi-sinusoid ﬁts that we now describe. To search for signals in these sparsely-
sampled data, we ﬁrst transformed the UTC times of the CSS data to a uniform timescale (TDB)
and then corrected these for light-travel delays to the solar system barycentre. The periodogram of
these data is dominated by the strong orbital modulation, which leaks so much power across the
spectrum owing to the sparse sampling that the spin/beat component can only be seen after the or-
bital signal is removed. Once this was done, beat and spin components matching those of Extended
Data Fig. 5 could be identiﬁed (Extended Data Fig. 6). We carried out bootstrap multi-sinusoid ﬁts
to compute the distributions of the orbital, beat and spin frequencies. The orbital frequency closely
follows a Gaussian distribution; the beat and spin distributions are somewhat non-Gaussian in their
high and low frequency wings respectively, but are nevertheless well-deﬁned. Statistics computed

13

from these distributions are listed in Extended Data Table 2.

Having established that the two pulsation frequencies are separated by the orbital frequency,
νB = νO, but also allowed
we carried out a ﬁnal set of ﬁts in which we enforced the relation νS
for a linear drift of the pulsation frequency in order to be sensitive to any change in the pulsation
frequency. This led to a signiﬁcant improvement in χ2 (> 99.99% signiﬁcance on an F -test) which
dropped from 326 to 289 for the 299 ﬁtted points relative to a model in which the frequencies did
not vary (after scaling uncertainties to yield χ2/N
1 for the ﬁnal ﬁt). Bootstrap ﬁts gave a

Pulsations are detected at all wavelengths with suitable data other than X-rays, where limited

the main text. The Swift X-ray observations were taken in 1000 s chunks over the course of more
than one month and we searched for the pulsations by folding into 20 bins and ﬁtting a sinusoid to
the result. There were no signiﬁcant signals on either the beat or spin periods or their harmonics.
We used a power-law ﬁt to the X-ray spectrum to deduce the slopes shown in Fig. 4.

The M star’s spectral type and distance. The CSS data establish the orbital period P = 0.14853528(8) d,
but not the absolute phase of the binary. This we derived from observations of the M star, which
also led to a useful constraint upon the distance to the system. The VLT+FORS data were taken
shortly before the photometric minimum, allowing a clear view of the M star’s contribution. We
used M star spectral-type templates developed from SDSS spectra39 to ﬁt AR Sco’s spectrum, ap-
plying a ﬂux scaling factor α to the selected template and adding a smooth continuum to represent
any extra ﬂux in addition to the M star. The smooth spectrum was parameterised by exp(a1 + a2λ)
to ensure positivity. The coefﬁcients a1, a2 and α were optimised for each template, with emission
lines masked since they are not modelled by the smooth spectrum. Out of the templates available
(M0-9 in unit steps), the M5 spectrum gave by far the best match with χ2 = 24,029 for 1165
points ﬁtted compared to > 100,000 for the M4 and M6 templates on either side (Extended Data
Fig. 1). The templates used were normalised such that the scaling factor α = (R2/d)2. We found
10−11. Assuming that the M star is close to its Roche lobe
α = 3.02
(there is evidence supporting this assumption in the form of ellipsoidal modulations of the minima
between pulsations in the HAWK-I data, Fig. 2), its mean density is ﬁxed by the orbital period,
which means that its radius is ﬁxed by its mass. Assuming M2 = 0.3 M(cid:12), for reasons outlined in
the main text, we ﬁnd that R2 = 0.36 R(cid:12), and hence d = 149 pc. This is an overestimate as the
FORS spectrum was taken through a narrow slit. We estimated a correction factor by calculating
the i(cid:48)-band ﬂux of the spectrum (2.50 mJy) and comparing it to the mean i(cid:48)-band ﬂux (4.11 mJy)
of the ULTRACAM photometry over the same range of orbital phase. This is approximate given
that the ULTRACAM data were not taken simultaneously with the FORS data and there may be
stochastic variations in brightness from orbit-to-orbit, however the implied 61 % throughput is

10−21, so R2/d = 5.5

We used the radius, spectral type and distance to estimate the KS ﬂux density from the
donor as fKs = 9.4 mJy. The minimum observed ﬂux density from the HAWK-I data is 9.1 mJy.
Uncertainties in the extrapolation required to estimate the KS ﬂux and from ellipsoidal modulations
allow the numbers to be compatible, but they suggest that the estimated distance is as low as it can
be and that the M star dominates the KS ﬂux at minimum light. The estimated M star ﬂuxes for i(cid:48)
and g(cid:48), fi(cid:48) = 1.79 mJy and fg(cid:48) = 0.07 mJy, are comfortably less than the minimum observed ﬂuxes
of 2.57 mJy and 0.624 mJy in the same bands. We do not detect the white dwarf. The strongest
constraint comes from the HST far ultraviolet data which at its lowest require T1 < 9750 K. A
white dwarf model atmosphere of T = 9750 K, log g = 8, corrected for slit-losses is plotted in
Fig. 1, and also (without slit losses) in Fig. 2 which shows the average HST spectrum. Given the
small maximum contribution of the white dwarf seen in these ﬁgures, the absence of absorption
features from the white dwarf is unsurprising.

The M star’s radial velocity. We used spectra taken with the ISIS spectrograph on the WHT and
X-SHOOTER on the VLT to measure radial velocities of the M star using the NaI 8200 doublet
lines. These vary sinusoidally on the same 3.56 h period as the slowest photometric variation
(Fig. 1), hence our identiﬁcation of this period as the orbital period. We ﬁtted the velocities with

VR = γ + K2 sin (2π(t

T0)/P ) ,

is

BMJD(TDB) = 57264.09615(33) + 0.14853528(8)E,

where E is the cycle number, and the time scale is TDB, corrected to the barycentre of the solar
system, expressed as a Modiﬁed Julian Day number (MJD = JD
2400000.5). This ephemeris
is important in establishing the origin of the emission lines, as will be shown below.

where i is the orbital inclination. This is a hard lower limit to the mass of the compact object,

is sometimes observed that irradiation can weaken the absorption lines on the side of the cool star

15

facing the compact object causing the observed radial velocity amplitude to be an over-estimate
of the true amplitude40,41. If this effect applied here, which we suspect it might, both K and the
mass function limit would need to be reduced. Given the large intrinsic variability of AR Sco, and
the lack of ﬂux-calibrated spectra, it was not possible to measure the absolute strength of NaI. We
attempted therefore to search for the inﬂuence of irradiation from another side effect, which is that
it causes the radial velocity to vary non-sinusoidally42. We failed to detect any obvious inﬂuence
of irradiation through this method, but its effectiveness may be limited by the heterogeneous nature
of our data which required multiple systematic velocity offsets. Despite our failure to detect clear
signs of the effect of irradiation upon the M star’s radial velocities, we would not be surprised if
20 km s−1 lower than we measure. However, with no
the true value of K was anything up to
clear evidence for the effect, in this we paper we proceed on the basis that we have measured the
true value of the M star’s centre of mass radial velocity amplitude. This is conservative in the sense
that any reduction in K would move the mass limits we deduce to lower values, which would tilt
the balance even more heavily towards a white dwarf as the compact star. The UV and optical
emission lines come from the irradiated face of the M star and their amplitude compared to K2 sets
a lower limit to the relative size of the M star, and hence, through Roche geometry, the mass ratio
q = M2/M1. Extended Data Fig. 4 shows how the emission measurements lead to the quoted limit
of q > 0.35, which leads in turn to the lower limits M1 > 0.81 M(cid:12) and M2 > 0.28 M(cid:12) quoted in
the main text.

The orbital period of a binary star sets a lower limit on the mean densities of its component
stars43. Since the mean densities of main-sequence stars decrease with increasing mass, this im-
plies that we can set an upper limit to the mass of any main-sequence component. In the case of
> 8900 kg m−3 which leads to M2 < 0.42 M(cid:12); the slightly larger value
AR Sco we ﬁnd that
of 0.45 M(cid:12) quoted in the text allows for uncertainty in the models. The limit becomes an equality
when the M star ﬁlls its Roche lobe, which we believe to be the case, or very nearly so, for AR Sco.
However, we expect that even in this case the number deduced still functions as an upper limit be-
cause the mass-losing stars in close binaries are generally over-sized and therefore less dense than
main-sequence stars of the same mass44. Indeed, systems with similar orbital periods to that of
44. This, and the M5 spectral type,
AR Sco have donor star masses in the range 0.2 M(cid:12) to 0.3 M(cid:12)
are why we favour a mass of M2

0.3 M(cid:12), close to the lower limit on M2.

Brightness temperature at radio wavelengths. The pulsations in radio ﬂux are a remarkable
feature of AR Sco, unique amongst known white dwarfs and white dwarf binaries. If we assume
that, as at other wavelengths, and as suggested by the alignment of the second harmonic power
with 2νB (Extended Data Fig. 3), they arise largely from the M star, then we can deduce brightness
temperatures from the relation

respectively. Although the value at the lowest frequency exceeds the
severe cooling of the electrons due to inverse Compton scattering is thought to occur45, this is
not necessarily a serious issue given the short-term variability exhibited by the source. The limits
can be lowered by appealing to a larger emission region as the radio data in hand are not enough
to be certain that emission arises solely on the M star. Even so, the 0.98 min second harmonic
pulsations that are seen in the radio ﬂux suggest an upper limit to the size of the emission region
of 25 R(cid:12) from light-travel time alone. This implies a minimum brightness temperature of 109 K
at 1.4 GHz, showing clearly that the radio emission is non-thermal in origin. We assume that
synchrotron emission dominates; while there may be thermal and cyclotron components at shorter
wavelengths, there is no clear evidence for either.
