Abstract

With the advancement of the accelerator systems and the requirements of high
luminosity particle beams to reach diﬀerent physics goals, detectors with good
position resolution and high rate handling capability have become essential for
designing any High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. The Gas Electron Mul-
tiplier (GEM) detectors are widely used in many HEP experiments as a tracking
device because of their good spatial resolution and rate handling capability.

The presence of the dielectric medium inside the active volume of the GEM
detector changes its behaviour when exposed to external radiation. This mecha-
nism is commonly referred as the charging-up eﬀect. In this article, the eﬀect of
the charging-up phenomenon and the initial polarisation eﬀect of the dielectric
on the gain of the chamber are reported for a single mask triple GEM chamber
with Ar/CO2 gas mixture.

Introduction

Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector, introduced by Fabio Sauli in 1997 [1],
is used in many HEP experiments [2] for its high rate handling capability
(∼1MHz/mm2) [1] and good position resolution (∼ 70 µm) [3]. The micro
pattern structure of the foil is utilised to achieve good position resolution, to
reduce the ion backﬂow in case it is used in a drift chamber and also to handle
high rates [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. A standard GEM foil consists of a 50 µm Kapton foil
with 5 µm copper cladding on both sides. A large number of holes are etched
into the Copper cladded Kapton foil using the photolithographic technique [9].
Depending on the etching technique, the GEM foils are classiﬁed as a double
mask or single mask type. The single mask technique is developed mainly due

to the requirement of the large area GEM chambers where the alignment of
the two masks (on the top and bottom side of the copper cladded Kapton foil)
is not possible. However, the holes obtained with the single mask technique
is asymmetrically bi-conical in shape as compared to the holes obtained with
the double mask technique [10]. Diﬀerent studies are performed to understand
the eﬀect of the variation of hole geometry on the ﬁnal performance of the
chamber [11, 12, 13]. The dielectric medium (Kapton) present in the active
volume of the detector, changes the behaviour of the chamber when exposed
to external radiation. As a result, the gain of the chamber increases initially
and then reaches a constant value asymptotically. This increase in gain is due
to the charging-up of the dielectric medium. Many diﬀerent groups have re-
ported on the studies to understand the eﬀect of this charging-up phenomenon
in GEM detectors [14, 15, 16]. The charging-up eﬀect for a double mask triple
GEM prototype (10 cm × 10 cm) is reported in Ref. [17]. In the present work,
the eﬀect of charging-up on a single mask triple GEM chamber of dimension
10 cm × 10 cm, operated with Ar/CO2 gas mixture in 70/30 volume ratio is
investigated with Fe55 X-ray source and reported in this article. The eﬀect of
initial polarisation of the dielectric is also investigated for diﬀerent gain of the
chamber with diﬀerent irradiation rates. The details of the GEM prototype and
experimental setup are discussed in section 2 and the results are reported in
section 3.

2 Detector description and experimental setup

The single mask triple GEM detector prototype consisting of 10 cm ×10 cm
standard stretched foils, obtained from CERN is assembled in the clean room
of the RD51 laboratory [18]. The drift gap, transfer gap 1, transfer gap 2 and

used between the HV line and resistive chain.

the induction gap of the chamber is kept at 3, 2, 2, 2 mm respectively [19]. A
voltage divider resistive chain is used to power the chamber as shown in Fig. 1.
A low pass ﬁlter is placed between the HV module and resistor chain as shown

in Fig. 1 to bypass the ac components present in the HV line. The chamber
has an XY printed board (256 X-tracks, 256 Y-tracks) on the base plate and
that works as the readout plane. Each of 256 X-tracks and 256 Y-tracks is
connected to two 128 pin connectors. However, for the purpose of this work
individual track readout is not used. Instead of that, a sum-up board (provided
by CERN) is used for each 128 pin connector. A total of 4 sum-up boards
are used in this prototype. The signal from one of the sum-up boards is put
to a charge sensitive preampliﬁer (VV50-2) having gain 2 mV/fC and shaping
time 300 ns [20]. The output signal from the preampliﬁer is fed to a linear
Fan-in-Fan-out (linear FIFO) module. One analog signal from the linear FIFO
is put to a Single Channel Analyser (SCA) to measure the rate of the incident
particle. The SCA is operated in integral mode and the lower level in the SCA
is used as the threshold to the signal. The threshold is set at 0.9 V to reject
the noise. The discriminated signal from the SCA, which is TTL in nature,
is put to a TTL-NIM adapter and the output NIM signal is counted using a
scaler. Another output of the linear FIFO is fed to a Multi-Channel Analyser
(MCA) to obtain the energy spectra. The schematic of the electronic circuit is
shown in Fig. 2. For the entire study, the chamber is operated with pre-mixed

Ar/CO2 gas in a 70/30 volume ratio. A constant gas ﬂow rate of ∼3.5 l/hr is
maintained using a V¨ogtlin gas ﬂow meter. Collimators are used to irradiate the
chamber with diﬀerent X-ray ﬂux coming from the Fe55 source. The ambient
temperature, pressure and relative humidity are monitored continuously using
a data logger, built-in house [21].

3 Results

The eﬀect of charging-up of the dielectric inside the active volume of the chamber
on its performance is studied. The Fe55 energy spectra obtained from the MCA
is analysed and the gain is calculated in the same way as mentioned in Ref. [17].
In Fig. 3, the typical Fe55 spectrum is shown for the single mask triple GEM
chamber at - 5100 V which corresponds to ∆V of 410 V across each of the GEM

foils. To measure the initial polarisation eﬀect of the dielectric, the recording
of the spectra is started as soon as the HV reached its speciﬁc set value and
the source is placed at a particular position of the chamber. The same Fe55
source is used to irradiate the chamber as well as to record the X-ray spectra.
To see the eﬀect of HV and irradiation rates on the initial polarisation of the
dielectric, X-ray spectra with diﬀerent HV and collimator settings are recorded
for 20 seconds without any interval between two consecutive measurements. The
details of the HV settings used for the study of initial polarisation eﬀect, their
corresponding ∆V across each GEM foils, average gain and the electric ﬁeld
strengths in the drift, transfer and induction gaps are listed in Table 1.

Due to the initial polarisation eﬀect, the decrease in gain for the ﬁrst few minutes
as reported in Ref. [17], is also observed in this study. In Fig. 4, the variation

The variation in ambient temperature (T) to pressure (p)
ratio for the ﬁrst 20 minutes is below 1% for all the measurements. Though the
variation of gain in any gaseous detector with temperature and pressure is a well
known phenomenon [22] but since the variation in temperature to pressure ratio
is small, no T/p normalisation is performed for this initial period. To identify
the time up to which the gain decreases initially, the gain is ﬁtted with a 2nd
degree polynomial using the chi-square minimisation technique, as available in
ROOT [23]. From the ﬁtting parameters, the ratio p1 /2p2 gives the minimum.
The ﬁtted curve with the respective chi-square value is shown in Fig. 4. The

same technique is repeated for diﬀerent gain and rate conﬁgurations to ﬁnd out
the time up to which the gain reduces due to the initial polarisation of the
dielectric and then again starts to increase due to the charging-up eﬀect.

In table 2, the time (hour) up to which the initial gain decreases due to the

initial polarisation eﬀect is listed for diﬀerent ∆V and irradiation rates.

In Fig. 5, the variation in the time of the initial decrease of gain for diﬀerent
irradiation rates is shown. The data points are ﬁtted with a linear function.
It is observed that the time up to which the gain decreases initially due to
the polarisation eﬀect is anti-correlated with the voltage across the GEM foils.
An eﬀect of the irradiation rates on the polarisation eﬀect is also observed.
As shown in Fig. 6, the rate of decrease of time with ∆V increases with the
increasing rate of irradiation.

To observe the eﬀect of charging-up phenomenon, the HV is switched on for
around ∼ 60 minutes before starting the measurement to ensure that the polar-
isation of the dielectric in the GEM foil is over. After that, the measurement is
started as soon as the Fe55 X-ray source is placed on the chamber. The spectra
for 60 seconds are stored at an interval of 120 seconds and analysed to obtain

Table 3: Saturated gain and charging-up time for diﬀerent irradiation rates.

The charging-up time for diﬀerent X-ray ﬂux is shown in Fig. 8. The charging
up time varies between 0.2 - 0.4 hour depending on the rate of irradiation as
shown in Fig. 8. In Fig. 9, the variation of gain as a function of time (hour)
is shown to illustrate both the eﬀects of polarisation and charging-up of the
dielectric medium on the gain of the chamber. It is visible in Fig. 9 that initially,
the gain decreases due to the initial polarisation eﬀect of the dielectric for around
0.1 hour. After that due to the charging-up eﬀect, the gain starts to increase
and saturates after around 1.0 hour.

4 Summary and Outlook

The eﬀect of charging-up phenomena and initial polarisation of the dielectric
inside the active volume of the 10 cm × 10 cm single mask triple GEM prototype
is investigated with Fe55 X-ray source at diﬀerent gains and irradiation rates.

chamber.

The chamber is operated with Ar/CO2 gas mixture in the 70/30 volume ratio.
The eﬀect of initial polarisation of the dielectric is investigated for four diﬀerent
irradiation rates and with three diﬀerent voltage settings. To quantify the eﬀect
of rate and ∆V across the GEM foils on the polarisation eﬀect, the initial
decrease of the gain of the chamber is ﬁtted with a 2nd degree polynomial and
then from the ﬁtting parameters, the time up to which the gain is decreasing
initially is found out. It is observed that this time decreases with increasing ∆V
across the GEM foils. A correlation is also observed between the irradiation
rates and the eﬀect of the initial polarisation of the dielectric. At a given ∆V,
with increasing particle ﬂux, the time required to reach the minimum gain value

due to the modiﬁcation of the electric ﬁeld lines inside the GEM holes, i.e the
charging-up eﬀect. In order to quantify the eﬀect of the rate on the charging-up
eﬀect, the T/p normalised gain is ﬁtted with eqn. 1 and p2 gives the charging-up
time taking analogy from the charging-up mechanism in RC networks [24]. The
charging-up time is found to be between 0.2-0.4 hour.

The comparison between the charging-up eﬀect measurement between the
double mask triple GEM chamber as reported earlier [17] and the present mea-
surement with the single mask triple GEM chamber are the following. The HV
ﬁlter was not used before the resistive chain in the measurement setup with
a double mask triple GEM chamber. The charging-up measurement was per-
formed at a ∆V ∼ 390 V across GEM foils and the respective drift ﬁeld, transfer
ﬁelds, and induction ﬁeld was ∼ 2.3 kV/cm, ∼ 3.5 kV/cm, and ∼ 3.5 kV/cm.
The charging-up time was found to be 2.376 + 0.02 hour, 1.524 + 0.008 hour
and 1.395 + 0.004 hour for irradiation rates of ∼ 0.08 kHz/mm2, 0.2 kHz/mm2
and 3.2 kHz/mm2 respectively. The saturation gain for the irradiation rates
∼ 0.08 kHz/mm2, 0.2 kHz/mm2 and 3.2 kHz/mm2 was ∼ 4900, 5100 and 5500
respectively.
