Abstract 

Among  various  perovskite  proton  conducting  oxides, Y-doped  BaZrO3  perovskite  is  a  promising  material  for 
electrochemical hydrogen devices due  to the good chemical stability and higher proton conductivity at higher 
operating temperatures like 500-800 °C. For the practical application of the functional BaZrO3 proton conductor 
in the electrochemical hydrogen devices, its necessary to understand the isotopic effect of proton conductivity. To 
understand the isotopic effect of proton conductivity in the barium zirconates, in this study, the proton conductivity 
in the Ar, (Ar + 4% H2), (Ar + 4% D2), (Ar + H2O), (Ar + D2O), and O2 atmospheres were measured for two 
different compositions: BaZr0.9Y0.1O2.95 (BZY), and BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O2.97 (BZYC) in the temperature range 
from 500 °C to 1000 °C. By comparing the obtained results, a significant difference in sinterability, conductivity, 
and the isotopic effect was observed due to the co-doping of the Co element in the BaZr1-xYxO3-α proton conductor.

Introduction 

Power  production  using  hydrogen  is  one  of  the  sustainable  and  safe  energy  generation  methods  [1,2]. 
Hydrogen  energy,  as  well  as  fusion  energy,  is  highly  expected  as  a  future  energy  source  to  solve  the  roots  of 
environmental and fuel depletion problems [2–7]. Hydrogen isotopes such as deuterium (D) and tritium (T) are used 
as fuel for fusion power generation. The fusion reactions that are usable in fusion reactors are given below (Eqs. 
(1)-(4)): 

D + T → 4He + n +17.6 MeV 

D + 3He → 4He + n + 18.3 MeV 

D + D → T + p + 3.0 MeV 

D + D → 3He + n + 3.3 MeV

Among the above fusion reactions, the DT reaction shown in Eq. (1) can be obtained with the lowest input 
energy and the generated output energy is large. Therefore, the current research and development of fusion is the 
DT fusion reactor [4]. 

Oxide ceramic materials have excellent chemical and physical features such as hardness, incombustibility, 
and rustproofness when compared with metals and plastic materials [8–12]. Oxide ceramic materials can be exposed 
under  extremely  severe  conditions  such  as  high  temperature,  corrosive,  and  attritional  environments.  Most 
common  ceramic  materials  including  oxide  ceramics  resist  these  severe  environments  and  have  better 
performance than metals and plastic materials. Therefore, the oxide ceramic materials can be widely applied in 
the area of the new energy system, information system, and recent communication devices [9], also could be used 
under extreme conditions like nuclear fusion reactor environment [13]. Proton conductive oxide ceramics material 
could be used as functional electrochemical materials for the nuclear reactor DT fuel circulation system, scientists 
are currently conducting in-depth research on various properties of proton conductive oxides in this regard [14–16].

In our previous studies, we  reported the hydrogen solubilities and diffusivities behavior along with the 
distribution of hydrogen in the outer and inner portion of the BZY and BZYC proton conducting oxide materials 
using  the  tritium  imaging  plate  (TIP)  technique  (Fig.  1)  [5,6,17].  But  for  the  practical  application  of  proton 
conducting  oxides  in  the  fusion  reactor’s  fuel  circulation  system,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  the  hydrogen 
conductivity behavior along with the isotopic effect, but data are not sufficient in the literature. For this reason, in 
this study, we report the conductivity behaviors of BZY and BZYC in various hydrogen-containing atmospheres 
especially the deuterium and heavy water atmospheres. 

2  Proton dissolution and conduction mechanism in BaZrO3 

BaZrO3 itself does not show high proton conductivity but has high proton conductivity by substituting the 
zirconium ion (Zr4+) at the B site with a trivalent cation, i.e., In3+, Yb3+, Y3+, Gd3+, etc. Among them, it has been 
reported that when doped with yttrium ion (Y3+), it exhibits the highest proton conductivity [18–20]. Regarding the 
doping amount, it has been reported that in BaZr1-xYxO3-α, the proton conductivity increases as the doping amount 
••) 
of Y increases up to x = 0.2, i.e., 20% [21,22]. In this case, Zr4+ replaces by two Y3+ and one oxygen vacancy (Vo
is introduced. This oxygen vacancy creation could be described as a point defect using the Kröger-Vink notation 
equation, given by Eq. 5 [23]. 

Y2O3 + 2ZrZr

×  + OO

×  → 2YZr

 ′

 + Vo

•• + 2ZrO2 

(5) 

In other words, Y-doped BaZrO3 has a perovskite structure with oxygen vacancies as shown in Fig. 2, and 
the oxygen vacancies contribute to proton conduction. The BaZrO3 material is a mixed conductor that conducts 
oxide  ions  in  addition  to  protons,  and  there  are  also  reports  of  electron  conduction.  It  is  thought  that  proton 
conduction is dominant in the low-temperature range and oxide ions are dominant in the high-frequency range. 

Perovskite proton conductive oxides generally take protons not only from the hydrogen atmosphere but 
also from the water vapor atmosphere and exhibit proton conductivity. In the case of acceptor-doped perovskite-
structured oxides, the uptake of protons from hydrogen (Eq. (6)) and water vapor (Eq. (7)) is expressed by the 
following Kröger-Vink notation equations [24,25]: 

H2 + 2Oo

×   ↔  2OHo

• + 2e′ 

H2O + Oo

× + Vo

•  
••   ↔  2OHo

(6)   

(7)   

Here,  Oo

×  is an oxygen ion with a neutral charge,  OHo

•   is a hydroxide ion with a single positive charge 
sitting on an oxygen site,  e′  is an electron, and  Vo
•• is an oxygen ion vacancy with two positive charges. Eq. (6) 
represents that hydrogen is incorporated by binding to oxide ions in the lattice. Eq. (7) represents that protons are 
taken up through the oxygen vacancies created by doping the acceptor, and the reaction depends on the number 
of oxygen vacancies [26]. 

The Vehicle mechanism [27] and the Grothussus mechanism [28–30] are two common mechanisms of proton 
conduction in the proton conductors. The Vehicle mechanism is the mechanism by which protons move with the 
diffusion  of  other  large  mobile  species. As  an  example,  protons  in  water  move  to  other  sites  in  the  form  of 
hydronium ions (H3O+) using water (H2O) as a vehicle. In perovskite-type oxides, it is thought that O2- moves like 
a vehicle in the form of OH-. On the other hand, in the Grotthuss mechanism protons move through the structure 
by  transferring  protons  to  oxygen  ions  at  adjacent  sites  (reorientation)  and  rotating  around  oxygen  ions  by 
recombination of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3) [31–34]. 

Since the lattice in the crystal oscillates with a specific frequency and the same applies to the oxygen ions 
in the perovskite-type oxide, the distance between the oxygen ions in the structure is constantly changing. Protons 
in perovskite-type oxides are present in the vicinity of oxygen ions in the structure, so they can be treated as OHo. 
The distance between this OHo and the oxygen ion at the adjacent site is shortened by the lattice vibration, and 
the proton can jump to the oxygen ion at the adjacent site. The mechanism by which protons move in this manner 
is called the Grotthuss mechanism. This mechanism can generally be considered in two steps. One is an operation 
in which protons transfer to an oxygen ion at an adjacent site, and the other is an operation in which protons rotate 
around  an  oxygen  ion  (reorientation).  In  the  Grotthuss  mechanism,  by  repeating  these  two  steps,  protons  are 
conducted through the structure (Fig. 3) [34]. A structure with strong hydrogen bonds promotes proton transfer, but 
it is not advantageous for the reorientation of O-H bonds that require the breaking of hydrogen bonds, and it may 
reduce the reorientation rate and inhibit long-distance proton transfer [35].

3  Experimental 

3.1  Sintered pellet preparation and characterization 

The raw material powders BaZr0.9Y0.1O3-α (BZY) and BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O3-α (BZYC) (prepared by TYK 
Corporation Ltd., Japan) were used in this study to prepare the pellets by the solid-state reaction method [36]. After 
weighing  about  0.7  g  of  these  powders  using  an  electronic  balance  (AUY220,  manufactured  by  Shimadzu 
Corporation), uniaxial compression (load 0.5 t, about 60 MPa, 3 min) was performed for a circular mold sample 
of diameter 10 mm. Next, put the molded sample in a rubber probe fit, evacuate it with a diaphragm type dry 
vacuum pump (DAP-6D, manufactured by ULVAC, Inc.), and the cold hydrostatic press (load 8t, about 200MPa, 
15 min) was performed. This molded sample was sintered using a molybdenum (Mo) tube furnace at 1640 °C for 
20 h in an air atmosphere to get the final sintered pellet. 

Fig. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns for both powder and sintered bodies of the BZY, and BZYC. 
Table 1 shows the lattice constants of the powder and sintered body of both samples calculated by refining the 
diffraction pattern. From the values of the lattice constants of each axis along with corresponding angles obtained 
by refining each diffraction pattern, it was confirmed that both powder and sintered bodies of BZY and BZYC 
had a single phase of cubic crystals. The lattice constants (a = b = c) of BZY and BZYC powder were 4.1967 Å, 
and 4.1939 Å, respectively, whereas the lattice constants (a = b = c) of the BZY and BZYC sintered body were 
4.2128 Å and 4.1986 Å, respectively. 

Table 1 also provides the results of density measurement by the Archimedes method for BZY and BZYC 
samples. The relative density of BZY and BZYC was 98 %, and 99.7%, respectively. As a result of the density 
measurement, it was confirmed that all samples show very high relative density, and the density of BZYC was 
improved than BZY.   

The SEM images for both powder and sintered samples of BZY, and BZYC are shown in Fig. 5. In addition, 
EDX was performed to identify the constituent elements (Fig. 6). In the SEM images (Fig. 5) of the powder BZY, 
the particles are agglomerated with each other and the size of primary grains is not clear but the size of the particles 
seems to be 0.1 ~1.0 µm as appearing in literature [37–40]. From the outer surface SEM images for all samples, it is 
observed that the grain boundaries were clear and dense. Also, the rounded particles could be observed with fine 
particles and grain boundaries. From the fractured surface, it is clear that the surface grains seem to stick together. 
In addition, from EDX mapping it's clear that all chemical components of the specimen were uniformly distributed 
throughout the surface (Fig. 6). 

3.2  Fabrication of electrodes 

Both sides of the BZY and BZYC sintered pellets were wet-polished with a diamond polishing pad and SiC water-
resistant abrasive papers (# 400, # 600, # 800, # 1200, BUEHLER) to achieve a thickness of 0.86 mm. After that, 
platinum (Pt) paste was applied to both sides of the sample and baked at 1000 °C for 1  h in an air atmosphere. 
After baking, the side surface of the sample was lightly polished, and it was confirmed that there was no electrical 
continuity on any sides of the samples [41]. 

3.3  Measurement of conductivity 

Fig. 7 shows a schematic diagram of the conductivity measurement device used in this study. The Pt foil and Pt 
wire were brought into close contact with the Pt paste-coated surface of the sample. The measurement conditions 
were an applied voltage of 0.5 or 1.0 V and an operating temperature of 1000 - 500 °C. First, temperature rise to 
1000  °C,  and  then  measurement  was  done  up  to  500  °C  with  a  100  °C  decrement  for  each  measurement. A 
temperature controller  (Model-DB630, Chino Co. Ltd.) and a digital multimeter (Model-8240, ADC Co. Ltd.) 
were connected to a personal computer (PC) via general-purpose interface bus (GPIB), and in every minute the 
measured temperature and current values were recorded automatically in the PC data-storage disk. A DC standard 
voltage/current generator (Model-TR6142, ADC Co. Ltd.) was used as the power source, and an electrometer 
(Model-2000, Keithley Instrument) was used for temperature measurement. 

The measurement atmospheres were argon (Ar), Ar containing 4% hydrogen isotope (hereinafter,  (Ar + 
4% H2), and (Ar + 4% D2)), wet Ar containing hydrogen isotope (hereinafter, (Ar + H2O), and (Ar + D2O)), and 
oxygen (O2) with a flow rate of 100 mL/min. Wet Ar was measured by bubbling H2O or D2O with Ar gas. The 
H2O and D2O pressures were considered to be saturated water vapor pressures. The formula for calculating the 
conductivity is shown below (Eq. 8) [41]:

Here, σ is the conductivity, I is the steady-state value of the current,  t is the thickness of the measured 
sample, S is the cross-sectional area of the sample, and V is the value of the applied voltage. In addition, BZYC 
sample was measured three times in each atmosphere to confirm the reproducibility.   

4  Results 

In this paper, the conductivity of BZY in Ar, (Ar + 4% H2), (Ar + 4% D2), (Ar + H2O), (Ar + D2O), and O2 
atmospheres  are  denoted  as  𝜎BZY_Ar ,  𝜎BZY_H2 ,  𝜎BZY_D2 ,  𝜎BZY_H2O ,  𝜎BZY_D2O ,  and  𝜎BZY_O2 ,  respectively. 
Similarly,  the  conductivity  of  BZYC  in Ar,  (Ar  +  4%  H2),  (Ar  +  4%  D2),  (Ar  +  H2O),  (Ar  +  D2O),  and  O2 
atmospheres are denoted as  𝜎BZYC_Ar,  𝜎BZYC_H2,  𝜎BZYC_D2,  𝜎BZYC_H2O,  𝜎BZYC_D2O, and  𝜎BZYC_O2, respectively. 

All conductivities data in dry ((Ar + 4% H2) or (Ar + 4% D2)) or wet hydrogen-containing atmospheres 
((Ar + H2O) or (Ar + D2O)) for BZY are given in Table 2, and Fig. 8 represent the corresponding Arrhenius plot 
of conductivities. In the case of BZY, from Fig. 8(a), and (b) it is clear that the conductivity in both the dry and 
wet  hydrogen-containing  atmospheres  showed  a  higher  value  than  that  of  the Ar  atmosphere.  In  addition,  the 
conductivity  𝜎BZY_H2  is higher than that of  𝜎BZY_D2  at all measured temperatures (Fig. 8(a)), and similarly the 
conductivity of  𝜎BZY_H2O  is higher than that of  𝜎BZY_D2O  (Fig. 8(b)). This is thought to be due to the isotope 
effect. Furthermore, the conductivity is higher in the  𝜎BZY_O2  atmosphere than in the Ar atmosphere (Fig. 8(c)), 
suggesting conductivity dominated by oxide ions and holes in oxygen containing atmosphere. 

All conductivities data in dry ((Ar + 4% H2) or (Ar + 4% D2)) or wet hydrogen-containing atmospheres 
((Ar + H2O) or (Ar + D2O)) for BZYC are given in Table 3, and Fig. 9 represent the corresponding Arrhenius plot 
of conductivities. Similar to BZY, in the case of the BZYC, from Fig. 9(a) and (b) it is clear that the conductivity 
in both the dry and wet hydrogen-containing atmospheres showed a higher value than the Ar atmosphere. Besides, 
the conductivity of  𝜎BZYC_H2  is higher than that of the  𝜎BZYC_D2  at all measured temperatures (Fig. 9(a)), and 
similarly the conductivity of  𝜎BZYC_H2O  is higher than that of  𝜎BZYC_D2O  (Fig. 9(b)). This is thought to be due to 
the isotope effect. Furthermore, the conductivity is higher in the O2 atmosphere than in the Ar atmosphere (Fig. 
9(c)), suggesting that the conductivity is dominated by oxide ions and holes in oxygen containing atmosphere. In 
addition, BZYC showed a similar conductivity value as BZY at 900 °C and 1000 °C in both dry and wet hydrogen-
containing atmospheres, but it tended to be higher than BZY as the temperature became lower. 

The closed blue square data points of Fig. 10(a) denote the ratio of the conductivities in dry hydrogen-
containing atmospheres for BZY, i.e., between  𝜎BZY_H2  and  𝜎BZY_D2. This ratio is obtained by subtracting the 
conductivity  𝜎BZY_Ar  from the conductivities  𝜎BZY_H2  and  𝜎BZY_D2. Furthermore, the closed black circular data 
points  of  Fig.  10(a)  denote  the  ratio  of  the  conductivities  𝜎BZY_H2O   and  𝜎BZY_D2O .  This  ratio  is  obtained  by 
subtracting  the  conductivity  𝜎BZY_Ar   from  the  conductivities  𝜎BZY_H2O   and  𝜎BZY_D2O .  The  ratio  of  the 
) showed a similar value at 
conductivity of BZY under the dry hydrogen-containing atmosphere (𝜎BZY_H2 𝜎BZY_D2
700-1000 °C, and the isotope dependence increased as the temperature decreased. On the other hand, the ratio of 
conductivity  in  the  wet  hydrogen-containing  atmosphere  for  BZY  ( 𝜎BZY_H2O 𝜎BZY_D2O
 )  is  in  line  with  the 
hydrogen isotope ratio (=  √2) in classical theory [42], confirmed the isotopic effect.

The open blue square data  points of  Fig.  10(b) denote the ratio of the conductivities  in wet hydrogen-
containing atmospheres for BZYC, i.e., between  𝜎BZYC_H2  and  𝜎BZYC_D2. This ratio is obtained by subtracting 
the conductivity  𝜎BZYC_Ar  from the conductivities  𝜎BZYC_H2  and  𝜎BZYC_D2. Furthermore, the open black circular 
data points of Fig. 10(b) denote the ratio of the conductivities  𝜎BZYC_H2O  and    𝜎BZYC_D2O. This ratio is obtained 
by subtracting the conductivity  𝜎BZYC_Ar  from the conductivities  𝜎BZYC_H2O  and  𝜎BZYC_D2O. It is confirmed that 
the ratio of the conductivity of BZYC under dry hydrogen-containing atmosphere (𝜎BZYC_H2 𝜎BZYC_D2
) tends to 
increase the isotope dependence as the temperature decreases. In addition, except for the measured value at 500 °C, 
) is about 
the ratio of conductivity in the wet hydrogen-containing atmosphere for BZYC (𝜎BZYC_H2O 𝜎BZYC_D2O
the same in line with the hydrogen isotope ratio (=√2) in classical theory [42].

Table 4 shows the activation energies of BZY and BZYC under all atmospheres. It is confirmed that the 
activation  energy  of  BZYC  is  lower  than  that  of  BZY  in  the  reducing  atmosphere.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the 
oxidizing atmosphere, BZY and BZYC showed similar values of activation energies.

5  Discussion 

For both BZY and BZYC, the conductivity is higher in the dry and wet hydrogen-containing atmospheres 
than in the Ar atmosphere. In addition, since isotope dependence was confirmed in both dry and wet hydrogen-
containing atmospheres, it is considered that BZY and BZYC have proton conductivity, and their proton transport 
is due to the Grotthuss mechanism [34]. 

In BZYC, the conductivity at 900 °C and 1000 °C is similar to that of BZY in both dry and wet hydrogen-
containing atmospheres, but it is confirmed that the conductivity tended to be higher than that of BZY as the 
temperature  became lower. This is thought to be due to hydrogen solubility. From  our previous HT study,  we 
observed  that  the  hydrogen  solubility  of  BZY  decreases  as  the  temperature  decreases,  while  that  of  BZYC 
increases  (Fig.  1(a))  [5].  Since  BZYC  has  a  higher  hydrogen  solubility  at  low  temperatures  than  BZY,  it  is 
considered that the conductivity of BZYC became higher than that of BZY as the temperature became lower. 

When the isotope dependence of conductivity is treated based on the classical theory with OH bond and 
OD bond as harmonic oscillators, the difference in the frequency of the bond affects the pre-exponential factor of 
the diffusion, presented in Eq. (9) [42].

Regarding the isotope dependence in the perovskite-type proton conductive oxide, the difference in zero-
point  vibration  energy  between  the  O-H  bond  and  O-D  bond  oscillators  is  also  considered.  Hibino  et  al.  [43] 
measured  the  conductivity  of  CaZr0.9In0.1O3  by  the  complex  impedance  method  and  found  that  the  activation 
energies of conductivity under Ar + H2O and Ar + D2O atmospheres differed by the difference in zero-point energy. 
The difference in the activation energy is thought to be like Eq. (10) [26]. In this case, the isotope dependence of 
conductivity increases as the temperature decreases. 

𝐸D   −   𝐸H =  

h(𝜈D −   𝜈H)

(10)   

As a result of this study, both BZY and BZYC tended to become more isotope dependent as the temperature 
became lower in the dry hydrogen-containing atmosphere, which is consistent with the literature  [26,44]. On the 
other hand, in the wet hydrogen-containing atmosphere the conductivity ratio value is very close to the hydrogen 
isotope ratio of classical theory (= √2) regardless of the measured temperature. 

Furthermore, the conductivity is higher in the O2 atmosphere than in the Ar atmosphere, and the difference 
became larger as the temperature became lower. This may be due to conductivity is dominated by oxide ions and 
holes, and the reaction formula is shown below (Eq. (11)).

The conductivity of BZY obtained in this study is higher at 800-1000 °C than the literature values measured 
by Schober et al. in hydrogen atmosphere (sintering conditions: 1715 °C, 30 h, measurement atmosphere: Ar + 
4% H2) (Fig. 8(a))  [45]. The value was about the same at 600-700 °C and lower at 500 °C. This appears as the 
difference in the activation energy of conductivity, which is the slope of the Arrhenius plot. The activation energy 
of conductivity in this study is 1.04 eV, while the literature value is as low as 0.65 eV  [45]. The cause of the high 
activation energy of the sample in this study is considered to be the particle size and the resistance at the electrode 
interface, but a more detailed investigation is required. Besides, the BZY conductivity obtained in this study is 
higher at all measurement temperatures than the literature values measured by Slade et al. in the wet atmosphere 
(sintering conditions: 1400 °C, 10 h, measurement atmosphere: N2 + H2O) (Fig. 8(b)) [46]. These differences of 
current studies conductivities with the literature data might be for the denser sample (due to high-temperature long 
time sintering), which reduces the intergranular resistance to promote the conductivity. 

6  Conclusion 

In this study, the conductivity of BaZr0.9Y0.1O3-α and BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O3-α was investigated using a 2-terminal 
DC  method  to  understand  the  isotopic  effect  of  proton  conductivity  along  with  the  co-doped  sintering  aid  Co 
content  effect.  The  BZY  and  BZYC  samples  showed  higher  conductivity  both  in  the  dry  hydrogen  and  wet 
hydrogen atmospheres than in the Ar atmosphere. The conductivity increased even in the O2 atmosphere, and the 

5 

 
 
 
 
conductivity difference increased as the temperature decreased. Therefore, it is confirmed that BZY and BZYC 
are  mixed conductors because  of the consideration of  conductivity by oxide ions and holes  along with proton 
conduction.  From  the  obtained  results  and  discussion,  it  is  clear  that  sintering  aid  Co  not  only  improves  the 
sinterability but also improves the conductivity at 500-800 °C. Since isotopic dependence was confirmed both in 
the  dry  and  wet  hydrogen  atmospheres,  it  could  be  assumed  that  BZY  and  BZYC  are  the  potential  proton-
conducting functional oxide materials for the electrochemical hydrogen devices.
