XIA GUO AND YAN YANG

Abstract. The 4-girth-thickness θ(4, G) of a graph G is the minimum number
of planar subgraphs of girth at least four whose union is G. In this paper, we
n+1
obtain that the 4-girth-thickness of complete tripartite graph Kn,n,n is
2 (cid:7)
except for θ(4, K1,1,1) = 2. And we also show that the 4-girth-thickness of the
complete graph K10 is three which disprove the conjecture θ(4, K10) = 4 posed
by Rubio-Montiel (Ars Math Contemp 14(2) (2018) 319).

1. Introduction

The thickness θ(G) of a graph G is the minimum number of planar subgraphs
whose union is G. It was deﬁned by W.T.Tutte [8] in 1963. Then, the thick-
nesses of some graphs have been obtained when the graphs are hypercube [6],
complete graph [1, 2, 9], complete bipartite graph [3] and some complete multi-
partite graphs [5, 10, 11].

In 2017, Rubio-Montiel [7] deﬁne the g-girth-thickness θ(g, G) of a graph G
as the minimum number of planar subgraphs whose union is G with the girth of
each subgraph is at least g. It is a generalization of the usual thickness in which
the 3-girth-thickness θ(3, G) is the usual thickness θ(G). He also determined the
4-girth-thickness of the complete graph Kn except K10 and he conjecture that
θ(4, K10) = 4. Let Kn,n,n denote a complete tripartite graph in which each part
n+1
contains n (n ≥ 1) vertices.
3 m when
n ≡ 3(mod 6).

In [11], Yang obtained θ(Kn,n,n) = l

In this paper, we determine θ(4, Kn,n,n) for all values of n and we also give a
decomposition of K10 with three planar subgraphs of girth at least four, which
shows θ(4, K10) = 3.

Proof. It is trivial for n = 1, θ(4, K1,1,1) = 2. When n > 1, because |E(Kn,n,n)| =
3n2, |V (Kn,n,n)| = 3n, from Lemma 1, we have

θ(4, Kn,n,n) ≥ l

In the following, we give a decomposition of Kn,n,n into

planar subgraphs
of girth at least four to complete the proof. Let the vertex partition of Kn,n,n
be (U, V, W ), where U = {u1, . . . , un}, V = {v1, . . . , vn} and W = {w1, . . . , wn}.
In this proof, all the subscripts of vertices are taken modulo 2p, except that of
u2p+1, v2p+1, w2p+1.

Case 1. When n = 2p (p ≥ 1).
Let G1, . . . , Gp+1 be the graphs whose edge set is empty and vertex set is the

i (1 ≤ i ≤ p).

same as V (K2p,2p,2p).
Step 1: For each Gi (1 ≤ i ≤ p), arrange all the vertices u1, v3−2i, u2, v4−2i,
u3, v5−2i, . . . , u2p, v2p−2i+2 on a circle and join uj to vj+2−2i and vj+1−2i, 1 ≤ j ≤ 2p.
Then we get a cycle of length 4p, denote it by G1
Step 2: For each G1
i (1 ≤ i ≤ p), place the vertex w2i−1 inside the cycle and join
it to u1, . . . , u2p, place the vertex w2i outside the cycle and join it to v1, . . . , v2p.
Then we get a planar graph G2
Step 3: For each G2
i (1 ≤ i ≤ p), place vertices w2j for 1 ≤ j ≤ p and j 6= i,
inside of the quadrilateral w2i−1u2i−1v1u2i and join each of them to vertices u2i−1
and u2i. Place vertices w2j−1, for 1 ≤ j ≤ p and j 6= i, inside of the quadrilateral
w2iv2i−1ukv2i, in which uk is some vertex from U. Join each of them to vertices
v2i−1 and v2i. Then we get a planar graph Gi (1 ≤ i ≤ p).
Step 4: For Gp+1, join w2i−1 to both v2i−1 and v2i, join w2i to both u2i−1 and
u2i, for 1 ≤ i ≤ p, then we get a planar graph Gp+1.

i (1 ≤ i ≤ p).

For G1 ∪ · · · ∪ Gp+1 = Kn,n,n, and the girth of Gi (1 ≤ i ≤ p + 1) is at
least four, we obtain a 4-girth planar decomposition of K2p,2p,2p with p + 1 planar
subgraphs. Figure 1 shows a 4-girth planar decomposition of K4,4,4 with three
planar subgraphs.

Case 2. When n = 2p + 1 (p > 1).
Base on the 4-girth planar decomposition {G1, · · · , Gp+1} of K2p,2p,2p, by
adding vertices and edges to each Gi (1 ≤ i ≤ p + 1) and some other modiﬁ-
cations on it, we will get a 4-girth planar decomposition of K2p+1,2p+1,2p+1 with
p + 1 subgraphs.
Step 1: (Add u2p+1 to Gi, 1 ≤ i ≤ p) For each Gi (1 ≤ i ≤ p), we notice that the
order of the p − 1 interior vertices w2j, 1 ≤ j ≤ p, and j 6= i in the quadrilateral
w2i−1u2i−1v1u2i of Gi has no eﬀect on the planarity of Gi. We adjust the order of
them, such that w2i−1u2i−1w2p−2i+2u2i is a face of a plane embedding of Gi. Place
the vertex u2p+1 in this face and join it to both w2i−1 and w2p−2i+2. We denote
the planar graph we obtain by

Gi (1 ≤ i ≤ p).

Step 2: (Add v2p+1 and w2p+1 to
G1, put both v2p+1
and w2p+1 in the face wku1v1wtv2u2 in which wk is some vertex from {w2j | 1 <

j ≤ p} and wt is some vertex from {w2j−1 | 1 < j ≤ p}. Join v2p+1 to w2p+1, join
v2p+1 to u1, u2, and join w2p+1 to v1, v2, we get a planar graph

Step 3: (Add v2p+1 and w2p+1 to

1 ≤ j ≤ p and j 6= i}, and join it to u2i−1 and u2i. Place the vertex w2p+1 in the
face wkv2i−1utv2i in which wk is some vertex from {w2j−1 | 1 ≤ j ≤ p and j 6= i}
and ut is some vertex from U. Join w2p+1 to both v2i−1 and v2i, we get a planar
graph
Step 4: (Add u2p+1, v2p+1 and w2p+1 to Gp+1) We add u2p+1, v2p+1 and w2p+1 to
Gp+1. For 1 ≤ i ≤ 2p, join u2p+1 to each vi, join v2p+1 to each wi, join w2p+1
to each ui, join u2p+1 to both v2p+1 and w2p+1, and join v1 to u2, then we get a
planar graph

In [7], the author posed the question whether θ(4, K10) = 3 or 4, and conjec-

tured that it is four. We disprove his conjecture by showing θ(4, K10) = 3.

Remark 3. The 4-girth-thickness of K10 is three.

Proof. From [7], we have θ(4, K10) ≥ 3. We draw a 4-girth planar decomposition
of K10 with three planar subgraphs in Figure 5, which shows θ(4, K10) ≤ 3. The
remark follows.
