HOMOTOPICAL COMPLEXITY OF A BILLIARD FLOW ON THE 3D FLAT
TORUS WITH TWO CYLINDRICAL OBSTACLES

CALEB C. MOXLEY AND NANDOR J. SIMANYI

Abstract. We study the homotopical rotation vectors and the homotopical rotation sets for the
billiard ﬂow on the unit ﬂat torus with two disjoint and orthogonal toroidal (cylindric) scatterers
removed from it.

The natural habitat for these objects is the inﬁnite cone erected upon the Cantor set Ends(G)
of all “ends” of the hyperbolic group G = π1(Q). An element of Ends(G) describes the direction in
(the Cayley graph of) the group G in which the considered trajectory escapes to inﬁnity, whereas
the height function s (s
0) of the cone gives us the average speed at which this escape takes
place.

s

The main results of this paper claim that the orbits can only escape to inﬁnity at a speed not
)) the escape is feasible with any prescribed

exceeding √3, and in any direction e
speed s, 0
. This means that the radial upper and lower bounds for the rotation
set R are actually pretty close to each other. Furthermore, we prove the convexity of the set AR
of constructible rotation vectors, and that the set of rotation vectors of periodic orbits is dense in
AR. We also provide eﬀective lower and upper bounds for the topological entropy of the studied
billiard ﬂow.

The concept of rotation number ﬁnds its origin in the study of the average rotation around the
circle S1 per iteration, as classically deﬁned by H. Poincar´e in the 1880’s [20], when one iterates
S1. This is equivalent to studying the
an orientation-preserving circle homeomorphism f : S1
average displacement (1/n)(F n(x)
R of f on the universal
covering space R of S1. The study of ﬁne homotopical properties of geodesic lines on negatively
curved, closed surfaces goes back at least to Morse [17]. As far as we know, the ﬁrst appearance
of the concept of homological rotation vectors (associated with ﬂows on manifolds) was the paper
of Schwartzman [21], see also Boyland [1] for further references and a good survey of homotopical
invariants associated with geodesic ﬂows. In the paper [14] M. Misiurewicz describes the homotopi-
cal rotation intervals of “almost continuous” (in an appropriate sense) self maps of the circle. The
high-dimensional generalization of the classic concept of rotation numbers and sets, from the circle
to tori, is accomplished by Misiurewicz and Ziemian in [16]. The concept of “persistency” of the
rotation intervals of surjective circle maps is explored in [15]. Rotation sets of homeomorphisms of
the 2-torus are investigated, and the 1D concepts and results are generalized in [6]. Further general-
ization to toral ﬂows was done by Franks and Misiurewicz in [7]. In [11] Kwapisz proves that every
convex polygon with rational vertices can be obtained as the rotation set of a homemomorphism of
the 2-torus. A description of the rotation sets of subshifts of ﬁnite type is given by K. Ziemian in
[22]. A systematic study of the relationship between the topological entropy and the rotation set of

(to high-dimensional, fairly general dynamical systems), studied and successfully explored by W.

averages of f with respect to the possible T -invariant probability measures on X. In the paper [19]
Passeggi proves, in some sense, the result reverse to the content of [11]: It is shown there that the
rotation set of a topologically generic homeomorphism of T2 is a rational polygon.

Following an analogous pattern, in [4] we deﬁned the (still commutative) rotation numbers of a 2D
billiard ﬂow on the billiard table T2 = R2/Z2 with one convex obstacle (scatterer) O removed. Thus,
the billiard table (conﬁguration space) of the model in [4] was Q = T2

Despite all the advantages of the homological (or “commutative”) rotation vectors (i. e. that they
belong to a real vector space, and this provides us with useful tools to construct actual trajectories
with prescribed rotational behaviour), in our current view the “right” lifting of the trajectory
Q is to lift these segments to the universal covering space of Q, not
segments
of T3. This, in turn, causes a profound diﬀerence in the nature of the arising rotation “numbers”,
primarily because the fundamental group π1(Q) of the conﬁguration space Q is the highly complex

2.1. Principles for the design of admissible trajectories. The trajectories are constructed
following the principles enumerated below, see also Fig. 2.1.1. Throughout this construction of
length minimizing curves (using the variational method) we will be using an analogy from mechan-
ics as follows: The orbit segments under construction are being thought of as made by a spanned,
perfectly elastic rubber band that tries to shrink itself as much as possible, subjected to the side
conditions that it needs to touch the boundaries of some scatterers in an order prescribed by their
symbolic collision itinerary. The somewhat “misterious” concepts of “past force” and in the upcom-
ing text refer to the forces arising in this tightened rubber band that the already constructed piece
(the “past”) exerts on the current (present) piece under construction. The “future force” is deﬁned
analogously.

(1) In our construction of admissible trajectory segments, using the arc length minimizing
variational method, we will be assuming that the scatterers have radius r0 = 0. This does
not yield an actual toroidal (cylindrical) billiard trajectory. However, we can overcome this
problem by continuously swelling the radii to some small positive r0.

(2) A trajectory enters a cell through one of eight entry faces and exits through a diﬀerent exit

face.

(3) Each passage into or out of a cell C occurs via a collision with a scatterer, bounding the
corresponding entry- or exit face of the cell, meaning that the trajectory does not pass
through the tubular r0-neighborhood of the crossed face without bouncing back from a
scatterer bounding that face.

(4) During its time within C, the trajectory visits several scatterers.
(5) For any two consecutively visited scatterers, corresponding edges E1 and E2 (which are
necessarily diﬀerent), it should be true that the intersection of the convex hull conv(E1, E2)
of the edges and the interior of the fundamental cell should be nonempty.

(6) In the construction of an admissible trajectory segment, at a point of collision there is a
predetermined force from the past which pulls the point of contact between the trajectory
and the scatterer toward one end of the corresponding edge E. The construction should be
such that the future force pulls the point of contact to the opposite end of E, thus balancing
the point of contact so that it stays in the interior of the edge at the equilibrium.

(7) If the admissible trajectory under construction is to exit the cell via one of the four face
1 and the past force is pulling the point of contact P with the exit edge
crossings b, b−
upward in the x3 direction (i.e the previous edge of contact is on the top of the cell to exit
from), then we make sure that the future force also pulls the point P upward. The same
is required concerning forces pulling P downward in the x3 direction. This convention is
necessary to obtain proper billiard trajectories and to keep track of face crossings.

These principles, together with the arc-length minimizing variational method, yield a trajectory
whose point of contact with a scatterer occurs away from the ends of the scatterer in the fundamental
cell, i.e. away from the faces perpendicular to the scatterer, thus the arising shortest curce will indeed
be a segment of a billiard trajectory. Furthermore, any word in Γ can serve as the guiding symbolic
itinerary of the trajectory segment to be constructed this way. This guarantees that a trajectory of
a prescribed homotopy type can be constructed via the variational method for arc length minimizing
curves.

First we describe the fundamental group of the conﬁguration space.

As discussed in

2.1, the admissible trajectories are constructed in such a way that each point
1 and the
of contact pn with a scatterer has a force coming from the preceding point of contact pn
succeeding point of contact pn+1 which pulls pn toward opposite ends of the scatterer. Recall that
the two scatterers S1 and S2 are perpendicular and disjoint. The trajectories are immediately lifted
to the covering space R3 of T3.

3.1. Admissible turns. The requirements from
2.1 give rise to 17 admissible turns which are
unique up to time-reversal and geometric symmetry. These admissible turns, occuring within a
fundamental cell, are given in the table below along with a corresponding upper bound for the
maximum amount of time each trajectory piece remains within the fundamental cell.

2.1 shows that

Note that, in the construction of admissible billiard orbits using the arc-length minimizing varia-
tional method, these upper bounds are used to show the existence of billiard orbits whose liftings to
the fundamental group π1(
) escape to inﬁnity as fast as possible. While proving the lower radial
bound for AR in Theorem 3.2, we need to slow down the speed of escape by injecting idle runs, i.
e. pieces of the trajectory spending a long time in a single elementary cell.

3.2. Anchoring. In constructing an admissible orbit segment corresponding to an irreducible ﬁnite
word w = w1w2 · · ·
wk, the above construction works only if two additional toroidal scatterers are
added to the trajectory segment. The ﬁrst edge to be added is to the initial piece of the trajectory
segment whereas the second is to the ﬁnal piece of the trajectory segment constructed using the
principles enumerated above. These two edges are added in such a way that neither lengthens the
irreducible ﬁnite word w and that each balances the force acting on the initial or terminal point of
contact coming from the already constructed trajectory segment. Finally, we call the midpoints of
the the newly-constructed initial and ﬁnal edges of the trajectory segment the anchor points, and

HOMOTOPICAL COMPLEXITY OF A BILLIARD FLOW...

7

we call these newly-added initial and ﬁnal edges anchor edges.

We construct here the initial anchor point using the method just described. The construction of
the ﬁnal (terminal) anchor point is analogous. We construct the initial anchor point for only one
possible situation — all other situations can be constructed using the same method. Assume that
the constructed trajectory segment exits the fundamental cell through the upper face via the edge
and that the point coming from the already-constructed forward segment pulls

the point of contact (1, x2, 1) towards the point (1, 0, 1). Then the initial anchor point would be the

We note that the number √6 + 2√3 in the denominator of the radius is the weakest upper bound
that we obtained in the table at the beginning of Subsection 3.1 for the maximum amount of time
an admissible orbit segment can spend in each visited fundamental cell.

Proof. Let w = w1w2w3 . . . be an (irreducible) inﬁnite word corresponding to an end of the hyper-

Theorem 3.3. The full rotation set, and thus the admissible rotation set, is contained within a ball
centered at 0 with radius √3 = 1.732050808 . . . .

Proof. The proof is similar to the upper radial estimate for the full rotation set for the billiard
model discussed in [12]. However, we need to consider more face crossings in our current model.

Let S[0,T ]x0 be a trajectory segment with foot point x0 = x(0) and T large, St(x0) = x(t) =
(q(t), v(t)), v(t) = (v1(t), v2(t), v3(t)). Eventually, we’ll take T
and get asymptotic estimates.
Now, denote by na, nb, nc, nd the number of face crossings the trajectory segment S[0,T ]x0 makes
within the fundamental cell, where a face crossing means a crossing of the face of the fundamental
cell associated with each generator a, b, c, or d of the fundamental group. Hence, na would be the
z face (irrespective of direction), nb the number of crossings of the half

Theorem 3.4 (Convexity of the Admissible Rotation Set). The admissible rotation set AR is a
convex subset of the cone C.

Proof. The cone C is a totally disconnected, Cantor set-type family of inﬁnite rays that are glued
together at their common endpoint, the vertex of the cone. Therefore, the convexity of AR means
that for any (s, e)
AR. However, this
immediately follows from our construction, since we can always insert a suitable amount of idle runs
into an admissible orbit segment to be constructed, hence slowing it down to the asymptotic speed

Theorem 3.5 (Periodic Rotation Vectors are Dense in AR). All the rotation vectors (s, e)
that correspond to periodic admissible trajectories form a dense subset of AR.

Proof. The following statement immediately follows from the ﬂexibility of our construction: Given
any ﬁnite, admissible trajectory segment S[0,T ]x0, with the approximative prescribed rotation vector
AR, one can always append a bounded initial and terminal segment to S[0,T ]x0, so that

past force acting on the point of contact with the terminal anchor edge.

These two properties gurantee that, by releasing the midpoints as the points of contact and just
requiring that they diﬀer by the integer vector ~v, one constructs a periodic admissible orbit with

4. Topological entropy of the flow

In this section we use the classic result in dynamics which relates the growth rate of volume in the
universal covering of our fundamental domain to the topological entropy of the ﬂow. In particular,
we will use the result as stated in [12]:

T

T

log nT (x, y),

htop(r0) = lim
→∞
where htop(r0) is the topological entropy of the ﬂow of our billiard model and nT (x, y) is the number
of homotopically distinct trajectories joining x and y in our fundamental domain having arc length
no more than T . This calculation is independent of the choice of x and y. Note: The statement of
the above fact in [12] is made in terms of geodesic ﬂows on closed, connected C∞ manifolds having
non-positive sectional curvature. This result applies to our billiard ﬂow. For further reference, [13].
See [18] for an exposition on the relationship between our billiard model and geodesic ﬂows.

By using the result just stated, we may obtain upper and lower estimates for the topological
entropy our billiard ﬂow by estimating nT (x, y) from above and below, which we do in the proof of
the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1. The topological entropy of our billiard ﬂow is bounded below by
above by √3 log 7:
