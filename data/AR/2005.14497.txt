Abstract

We demonstrate control of magnetic domain structures in continuous FePd thin ﬁlms by pat-

terning their surfaces with plasma treatment. The Fe-oxide layer formed on the surface upon

ambient exposure of the FePd alloy thin ﬁlm grown on an Al2O3(0001) substrate was patterned

into microstructures by e-beam lithography followed by O2- or Ar-plasma treatment. Microscopic

pinning of magnetic domain walls in the thin ﬁlms is then observed by magneto-optic Kerr eﬀect

microscopy, with the magnetic ﬁeld needed to reverse the magnetization of the plasma-treated ar-

eas being larger than that for the untreated areas. An intriguing competition between the uniaxial

anisotropy and the exchange bias is also observed in the system. This study demonstrates that

patterning of the ﬁlm surface with plasma treatment can be an easy and eﬃcient method for so-

phisticated engineering of magnetic structures in thin ﬁlms, and therefore has potential application

in developing future data-storage and spintronic devices.

INTRODUCTION

Engineering of local magnetic properties of continuous thin ﬁlms has long been an im-

portant topic in design and fabrication of future spintronic devices, high-density magnetic

data-storage devices, and magnetologic devices. Since Chappert et al. ﬁrst reported the abil-

ity of ion irradiation to induce modiﬁcation of local magnetic properties without altering

topographic features,[1] ion-induced magnetic patterning has been investigated intensively

and demonstrated to be realized through patterned modulations of magnetic anisotropy,[2–

5] saturation magnetization,[6, 7] or exchange bias (EB).[8] Most of these modulations rely

mainly on changes in the interfacial structures, but also in the case of alloys on changes in

the chemical ordering.[9, 10] Ion irradiation with suﬃcient energy and ﬂuence has been used

in most studies to achieve changes in local magnetic properties for magnetic patterning. By

contrast, plasma treatment was utilized in very few experiments for the same purpose.[11]

Among potential materials for ultrahigh-density magnetic recording media, the FePd

ferromagnetic (FM) compound has been investigated intensively in recent years. FePd

with a tetragonal L10 phase has attracted much attention in light of its uniaxial magnetic

anisotropy (UMA),[12] perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA),[13] and high resistance

to corrosion.[14] With particular fabrication methods such as speciﬁc deposition geometries

or use of buﬀer layers, UMA and/or weak PMA are found in some FePd and other Fe-based

alloys even without long-range L10 ordering.[5, 15, 16] Capping of proper materials such as

Pd on FePd has been demonstrated to induce speciﬁc interaction at the interface due to the

anisotropy of FePd,[17, 18] which we consider can be a potential means of magnetic engineer-

ing. In this study, we demonstrate an easy method that utilizes e-beam lithography and O2-

or Ar-plasma treatment to magnetically pattern an FePd thin ﬁlm with a surface Fe-oxide

layer formed upon ambient exposure. The behaviors of the magnetic microstructures are

investigated in detail. It is observed that the plasma treatment promotes further Fe oxida-

tion, which prominently enhances the Pd concentration in the Pd-rich phase[19, 20] formed

beneath the Fe oxide on the upper side of the FePd layer. This alters the magnetic properties

of the system, leading to interesting eﬀects of domain pinning and competition between the

UMA and EB observed in magneto-optic Kerr eﬀect (MOKE) microscopy experiments.

II. MATERIAL AND METHODS

The 30-nm-thick FePd (50:50) alloy ﬁlms were deposited on Al2O3(0001) substrates by e-

beam heated co-evaporation in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 3×10−9

mbar. Two evaporation guns were both aligned at 45◦ to the normal. This oblique deposi-

tion geometry allows UMA to be developed on the surface plane.[15] The alloy compositions

and ﬁlm thicknesses were controlled by the respective deposition rates of the elements, and

were calibrated by Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),

atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray

spectroscopy. X-ray diﬀraction results showed that the ﬁlms grown do not exhibit long-

range L10 ordering. Then, the FePd ﬁlms were naturally oxidized after exposure to ambient

E-beam lithography and O2- or Ar-plasma treatment (Harrick Plasma Cleaner PDC-32G,

radio frequency 13.56 MHz) were utilized for the patterning process on the surface of Fe

oxide/FePd. The surface morphologies and chemical compositions are examined by atomic

force microscopy and XPS, respectively. The microscopic magnetic behaviors, including

magnetic hysteresis loops and magnetic domain structures, are monitored by a MOKE mi-

croscope with the presence of an in-plane magnetic ﬁeld H.[21]

As shown in Figs. 1(a)–1(g), e-beam lithography was performed to create a microstructure

pattern in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) for selective plasma treatment of the ﬁlm

surface afterwards, which results in a patterned Fe-oxide layer on top of the FePd alloy

ﬁlm. The optical images of an Fe oxide/FePd ﬁlm at stages of Figs. 1(d) and 1(g) are

shown in Figs. 1(h) and 1(i), respectively. Fig. 1(h) demonstrates a patterned PMMA layer

with arrays of 50 × 50 µm2 square holes spaced 50 µm apart. At a base pressure of 200

mTorr of the plasma chamber, 3 minutes of 10.5-Watt O2 plasma was used to bombard the

square areas, leaving the areas under PMMA intact. The plasma eﬀect on the squares is

hardly observable in the optical image in Fig. 1(i), but manifests itself in the atomic force

microscopy image in Fig. 1(j), with the dashed-line proﬁle shown in Fig. 1(k). In the intact

region outside the squares, the FePd surface is still covered by the Fe-oxide clusters naturally

self-assembled after ambient exposure. Inside the squares, however, the Fe-oxide layer has

become much smoother with reduced grain sizes after the O2 plasma treatment, and has

been identiﬁed by XPS depth proﬁling technique to be only ∼1 nm thick.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Magnetic patterning with O2- or Ar-plasma treatment

The FePd alloy ﬁlms reveal UMA induced by the oblique co-deposition. Fig. 2(a) shows

the MOKE hysteresis loops of a surface-patterned Fe oxide/FePd ﬁlm measured in the longi-

tudinal geometry with the magnetic ﬁeld applied along the directions close to the magnetic

easy (red curve) and hard (blue curve) axes, respectively. (The direction of the applied ﬁeld

or the Kerr sensitivity throughout the experiment is at an angle of ∼15◦ to the hard or easy

axis, and these directions are labeled in the ﬁgures as x and y axes, respectively.) When the

ﬁeld direction is close to the easy axis, a square hysteresis loop is observed with a magnetic

coercivity Hc of ∼4 Oe. When the ﬁeld is instead applied in a direction close to the hard

axis, which is in the ﬁlm plane orthogonal to the easy axis, a slim hysteresis loop with ex-

tremely small remanence is observed. Fig. 2(b) shows the MOKE hysteresis loops measured

with the magnetic ﬁeld applied along the direction close to the hard axis in the transverse

geometry, in which the plane of incidence is orthogonal to the magnetic ﬁeld. The black and

red curves represent the transverse MOKE hysteresis loops measured from the same region

of the ﬁlm before (Fig. 1(d)) and after (Fig. 1(g)) plasma treatment, respectively. The hys-

teresis loop becomes wider after plasma treatment. The asymmetry of the hysteresis loops

higher-order anisotropies in a heterostructure with complexity.[22] Displayed in Fig. 2(c) is

the evolution of the magnetic domain structures simultaneously recorded with the hysteresis

loops in Fig. 2(b) with increasing magnetic ﬁeld, and the eﬀect of surface patterning can be

clearly seen in these Kerr images. Both series of the images before and after plasma treat-

ment show the preferred alignment of the magnetic domains along the easy axis. However,

the evolution patterns are quite diﬀerent from each other. Before plasma treatment with the

patterned PMMA layer on the surface, there is no clear correlation between the magnetic

domain structure and the arrays of 50 × 50 µm2 squares in PMMA. This indicates that the

PMMA capping does not induce any observable change in the magnetic properties of the

Fe oxide/FePd ﬁlm, and thus the magnetic domain structure is irregular. By contrast, after

plasma treatment and PMMA removal, a magnetic domain structure with periodic stripes

is observed. During the reversal of the magnetization of the ﬁlm from the negative (dark

gray) to the positive (light gray) direction, the magnetic domains in the plasma-treated

squares seem to be pinned, presenting a delay in their magnetization reversal, until a larger

magnetic ﬁeld is applied. Therefore, the ﬁeld (∼15 Oe) required for the ﬁlm after patterned

plasma treatment to complete the magnetization reversal is higher than that (∼9 Oe) before

plasma treatment. This is consistent with the observation in Fig. 2(b) with the after-plasma

hysteresis loop being wider than the before-plasma loop.

Fig. 3 illustrates the detailed orientations of the magnetic moments of the surface-

patterned Fe oxide/FePd ﬁlm at H = 8.5 Oe. In the middle of the magnetization reversal

when the ﬁeld is around 8.5 Oe, the magnetic moments still prefer to align along the easy

axis instead of along the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, but are constructed into an antipar-

allel conﬁguration with a geometry matching the columns of the patterned square arrays.

The plasma treatment inside the squares induces remarkable pinning of magnetic domains.

The spatially-resolved transverse MOKE hysteresis loops of the plasma-treated area A and

that of the intact area B as indicated in Fig. 3(a) are plotted in Fig. 3(b) for comparison,

together with the hysteresis loop of the intact area C between the squares along the easy

axis. The magnetic moments in areas A and C start to ﬂip up gradually (i.e., to turn from

whole to partial dark gray) at a ﬁeld of around 8.5 Oe, whereas those in area B start to

ﬂip up earlier at a lower ﬁeld around 6.5 Oe. These ﬁelds are indicated on the respective

hysteresis loops in Fig. 3(b) with solid dots, located at the the sharp turning points in the

lowest parts of the loop curves. This again suggests that the domain pinning eﬀect is induced

by plasma treatment in area A. The magnetic domain in area C between the squares, on

the other hand, strongly depends on the anisotropy of the neighboring squares because of

lateral modulation along the easy axis.[5, 23–25] Therefore, the ﬁeld required for area C to

reverse the magnetization is about the same as that for area A, which results in dark stripes

connecting the squares along the easy axis in the Kerr image.

Exhibited in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) is the observable reversal of the contrast in the transverse

MOKE signal between inside and outside the squares at zero ﬁeld as the plane of incidence

changes from φ = 45◦ to −45◦, where φ is the angle of the present plane of incidence to that

(i.e., the y axis) in Fig. 3(a). (Contrast has been enhanced in Figs. 3(c)–3(f) for clarity.)

This indicates that plasma treatment truly modiﬁes the magnetic anisotropy of the ﬁlm, not

just its surface morphology, and the easy axis of the new anisotropy may be at an angle of

∼−45◦ to the y axis in Fig. 3(a), i.e., ∼−30◦ to the original easy axis. Polar MOKE images

at diﬀerent angles are also obtained as shown in Figs. 3(e) and 3(f), which interestingly

reveal perpendicular magnetization of the ﬁlm and again the contrast between inside and

outside the squares. The perpendicular magnetization can be attributed to the anisotropy

of FePd, which is known to be a ferromagnet (FM) with weak PMA.[17]

the magnetic behaviors of a continuous ﬁlm and create designed domains at the micro- or

potentially even nanoscale. E-beam lithography provides high pattern resolution and excel-

lent design freedom, which allows great ﬂexibility in future developments and applications

of magnetic patterning. Shown in Fig. 4(a) is an example of a diﬀerent pattern composed of

smaller squares of sides 25 µm, spaced 25 µm apart. Each square has a central square island

of side 9 µm that was previously protected by PMMA from O2 plasma. As one can see from

the series of images from left to right with increasing magnetic ﬁeld applied along the direc-

tion close to the hard axis, the magnetic patterning and domain pinning phenomena here

are similar to those observed in the previous case of 50 × 50 µm2 squares, except that traits

of the central-island eﬀect are found in the present case, with ﬁne light-gray domain strips

(some indicated with yellow arrows) running across the square through the central island,

showing that the reversal of the magnetization inside a square starts from the unpinned

central island previously protected from plasma. Fig. 4(b), on the other hand, shows the

result of 50 × 50 µm2 squares treated with Ar plasma instead of O2 plasma, demonstrating

that Ar plasma has similar patterning eﬀects to those of O2 plasma. This implies that the

sample surface treated with Ar plasma may have undergone structural modiﬁcation similar

to that with O2-plasma treatment.

B. Eﬀect of plasma treatment time on magnetic patterning

The eﬀect of plasma treatment is further examined by studying the evolution of the

magnetic domain structure as a function of the treatment time on another Fe oxide/FePd

ﬁlm. Shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) are the transverse MOKE hysteresis loops and the Kerr

images after diﬀerent O2-plasma treatment time durations with the ﬁeld direction close to

the hard axis. The lower panel of Fig. 5(a) is a zoomed-in view of the upper panel and

focuses on the magnetization reversal process displayed in Fig. 5(b). It can be seen that the

domain-pinning behavior of this ﬁlm is most prominent at a treatment time of 90 seconds,

from the fact that the periodic dark strips in Fig. 5(b) are most persistent at 90 seconds as

the ﬁeld is increased to 9 Oe. As the treatment time is increased further from this optimal

value, the domain-pinning eﬀect becomes less pronounced. The hysteresis loops in the lower

panel of Fig. 5(a) also show that the Kerr signal of the 90-second curve is smaller than all

the others when H ∼ 9 Oe, presenting a most prominent delay in magnetization reversal.

The most probable reason for long-time treatment to fail in domain pinning is that too

much plasma bombardment leads to serious interfacial mixing, which is assumed to cause

a reduction of the exchange interaction across the interface.[26] As the Fe-oxide layer gets

thinner during plasma treatment over a longer duration to provide less protection, the ion

bombardment on the FePd layer may cause disorder eﬀects that lead to essential changes in

the magnetic properties and exchange interaction.[8, 27–31] To investigate the possibility of

the disorder eﬀects in our case, the penetration depths of plasma ions into the ﬁlm and the
displacement damage proﬁle are estimated by srim simulation.[32] The simulation results

conﬁrm that the ions are mostly stopped in the oxide layer of the ﬁlms treated with the

optimal plasma treatment time, making the disorder eﬀects negligible in the FePd layer.

The mechanisms involved in the magnetic patterning are most likely to occur mainly in the

FePd layer, where a Pd-rich phase is formed upon Fe oxidation, as will be discussed in detail

in the following sections.

C. XPS analyses

The composition of the surface Fe-oxide layer of the ﬁlm is analyzed using XPS. Displayed

in Fig. 6(a) are the Fe 2p spectra before and after O2-plasma treatment, respectively. It can

be seen that, after plasma treatment, the α-Fe2O3’s Fe 2p3/2 peak at 710.5 eV and Fe 2p1/2

peak at 724.0 eV are both remarkably enhanced. The satellite peak of Fe 2p3/2 for α-Fe2O3

is also observed around 719.5 eV.[33] Other forms of Fe oxides such as Fe3O4 may coexist

α-Fe2O3 peaks. The Fe metal signal at 707 eV from the FePd underneath the oxide layer

can also been seen.

Presented in Fig. 6(b) are the O 1s spectra respectively before and after O2-plasma

treatment, which also demonstrate an obvious enhancement of the α-Fe2O3 signal around

529.7 eV. An additional peak is observed around 531.8 eV, which may be attributed to

oxygen vacancies[34] or surface contaminants of carbon and hydroxide. A very small shift

of the α-Fe2O3 O 1s peak to a higher energy is noticed after plasma treatment, which is

probably related to a decrease in the number of oxygen vacancies.[34]

These data indicate that the O2-plasma treatment does not remove the oxide layer, but

instead modiﬁes the morphology and composition of it, and even further oxidizes more Fe in

the existing FePd layer underneath and thus prominently increases the Pd concentration in

the Pd-rich phase beneath the oxide[19, 20] (Fig. 7) with more Fe oxide formed on the surface.

The pronounced increase of the α-Fe2O3 signal can be ascribed mainly to the oxidation eﬀect

of the O2 plasma, and partially to the more-densely-packed ﬁner oxide particles created after

plasma treatment and the reduction of surface contaminants identiﬁed by other XPS C 1s

measurements. Similar XPS features are also observed for the sample treated with Ar

plasma, as shown in Figs. 6(c) and 6(d). It is interesting to notice that Ar-plasma treatment

also results in an enhancement of the oxide signal. The probable explanation is that Ar-

plasma treatment gives rise to surface radicals,[35] which then promotes oxidation with the

presence of water and residual oxygen in the process chamber and on the sample surface.[36]

It is known that local variations in the exchange or magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies

can attract or even pin the domain walls under suitable conditions.[37] Similar phenomena

have been intensively studied in antiferromagnet (AFM)/ferromagnet (FM) systems with

magnetic defects [8, 37–39] or nonmagnetic dilution treatments.[39–42] With α-Fe2O3 be-

ing a canted AFM at room temperature, it was ﬁrst speculated that the mechanism of the

magnetic patterning might lie in the magnetic heterostructure of the α-Fe2O3 layer and

the ferromagnetic FePd layer. However, it requires well-oriented crystal planes (FM cou-

pling within the (0001) planes, and AFM coupling across neighboring planes)[43] or low

temperatures[44] for α-Fe2O3 to exhibit stable AFM behaviors, and therefore it is unlikely

for the amorphous α-Fe2O3/FePd interface to host reliable AFM–FM exchange interaction

at room temperature.

(Color online) Schematic diagram of the Pd-richer/FePd interface underneath the ox-

ide layer in the plasma-treated area. An in-plane anisotropy phase is established near the Pd-

richer/FePd interface.

The most plausible approach to interpret the domain-pinning eﬀect is to consider the

interaction at the Pd-rich/FePd interface. FePd is an FM with weak PMA (as revealed

in Figs. 3(e) and 3(f)), and Pd capping on FePd has been demonstrated to induce an

additional in-plane magnetic anisotropy near the Pd/FePd interface.[17, 18] With weak

PMA, well-ordered alternating up-and-down magnetic domains[45] are formed in FePd at

zero ﬁeld, and alternating left-and-right in-plane domains appear near the interface.[17, 46]

As plasma treatment leads to segregation of more Fe atoms from the FePd layer to form

more Fe oxide on the surface, the Pd-rich phase[19, 20] near the interface of FePd is turned

into a Pd-richer phase, establishing a Pd-richer/FePd interface underneath, as illustrated

in Fig. 7. The stronger interfacial in-plane anisotropy created inside the separate plasma-

treated squares thereby establishes an anisotropy that is diﬀerent from the continuous UMA

outside the squares, which leads to a delay in reversal of the magnetization observed inside

the squares. More theoretical and experimental work may be needed to fully understand

the underlying physics.

Interplay between exchange bias and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy

followed by measurements under small transient ﬁelds of 0 Oe → ±15 Oe → 0 Oe along the

direction close to the easy axis (Fig. 8(a)), or 0 Oe → ±50 Oe → 0 Oe along the direction

close to the hard axis (Figs. 8(b)–(e)).

Fig. 8(a) displays the longitudinal MOKE hysteresis loops with the ﬁeld direction close

to the easy axis after initial magnetization. The blue loops are obtained after initial mag-

netization at −3 kOe, the red ones are after initial magnetization at +3 kOe, and the black

ones are after demagnetization following an initial magnetization at 3 kOe. The demag-

netization is conducted using an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld of decreasing magnitude until

the magnetization is reduced to zero at zero ﬁeld. The shifts of the loops with high-ﬁeld

initial magnetization with respect to the demagnetized one declare the existence of EB in

our system, and that the directions of the EB ﬁelds can be freely controlled by the initial-

magnetization directions. These loops shift in the same direction as the initial high ﬁeld,

which is referred as ‘positive’ spontaneous EB.

Setting EB usually involves cooling an AFM/FM bilayer below the N´eel temperature in

the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld.[47] It has also been shown that related phenomenon can

occur in coupled two FMs with dissimilar magnetic properties,[48, 49] where the role of the

AFM is fulﬁlled by a hard FM layer, and EB setting is realized by applying a suﬃciently high

initial magnetic ﬁeld without the need of cooling preprocessing.[49, 50] This explains the EB

eﬀect observed in our system, where the Pd-rich layer with remnants of Fe is a soft FM[51],

whereas the FePd layer is an FM with weak PMA and an induced in-plane anisotropy

near the interface (Fig. 7). The initial high magnetic ﬁeld induces a non-zero net in-plane

magnetic moment in the Pd-rich layer, which stems from an enlargement of the closure

domains oriented parallel to the initial ﬁeld at the expense of those oriented antiparallel to

the ﬁeld. The coupling between the Pd-rich layer and the net in-plane magnetization of

the FePd layer then accounts for the observed shift of the hysteresis loop.[46] The positive

spontaneous EB arises from the interfacial AFM coupling between FePd and the Pd-rich

layer, with a net interfacial moments that are not reversed during the measurements of the

hysteresis loops.[52, 53]

It is worth noting that many of these hysteresis loops exhibit a pair of small kinks on

the top and bottom of each hysteresis loop near the central ﬁeld of the loop. An example is

shown in the inset of the top panel of Fig. 8(a), which is blown-up view of the top and bottom

15

parts of the ‘Demag.’ loop in the panel, with the kinks indicated by the black arrows. These

kinks are of magnitude close to the noise level and therefore can be easily missed, but their

reproducibility conﬁrms their existence. The pair of top and bottom small kinks points to

an additional switching ﬁeld attributed to a minority soft layer in the system,[48, 54] which

in our case is the Pd-rich layer. These kinks have also been observed in the hysteresis loop

of a SmCo ﬁlm with a mixture of SmxCoy phases being present,[48] which play similar roles

to the FePd phase and the Pd-rich phase in our system.

It is noticed in Fig. 8(a) that the loops taken inside (labeled ‘area A’) and outside (labeled

‘area B’) the 50 × 50 µm2 square exhibit positive EB of similar magnitudes. Since the Fe

oxide in area B was naturally formed in ambient air without plasma treatment, the Pd-rich

layer under the oxide is not as ‘rich’ as that in the plasma-treated area A, but seems to be

able to generate EB of a similar magnitude to that of area A, at least under the condition of

initial magnetization at ±3 kOe. However, the EB eﬀect in area A can be easily distinguished

from that in area B if longitudinal MOKE hysteresis loops are recorded with the magnetic

ﬁeld applied along the direction close to the hard axis, as shown in Fig. 8(b). With initial

magnetization at −3 kOe, the loop of area B (black curve) is apparently slimmer than that

of area A (red curve) in the positive signal, which reveals diﬀerent anisotropy between the

two areas.

The interplay between the EB and the anisotropy further manifests itself in the spatially-

resolved transverse MOKE hysteresis loops shown in Figs. 8(c)–(e) with the ﬁeld direction

close to the hard axis. Fig. 8(c) shows the loops taken after demagnetization, accompanied

with a corresponding Kerr image taken at 0 Oe. The two loops from areas A and B ap-

proximately overlap with each other, and thus the stripe domain pattern is barely seen in

the Kerr image. However, if the sample is measured after initial magnetization at a high

ﬁeld without demagnetization, distinct behaviors are observed as displayed in Figs. 8(d)

and 8(e). Whereas the loop of the intact area B approximately follows the route seen in

Fig. 8(c), the loop of the plasma-treated area A stays in the same sign of the magnetization

along the Kerr-sensitivity direction, which is positive with initial magnetization at a ﬁeld

of −3 kOe (Fig. 8(d)), and negative with initial magnetization at +3 kOe (Fig. 8(e)). This

again implies an in-plane AFM coupling existing in the system. The opposite magnetization

in areas A and B as the ﬁeld is swept to 0 Oe at the spots marked with the blue crosses

on the hysteresis loops leads to magnetic-domain patterns with clear contrast shown in the

16

Kerr images on the right. This clear contrast at zero ﬁeld cannot be achieved without the

presence of EB. Besides, the stripe domains with EB (Kerr images in Figs. 8(d) and 8(e))

are straighter than the ones observed without EB (lower panel in Fig. 2(c)).

The phenomenon observed in Figs. 8(c)–8(e) may be understood in terms of the compe-

tition between the UMA of our sample (i.e., having one easy axis) and the EB set by the

high initial external ﬁeld applied along the y axis, which is at an angle of ∼15◦ to the easy

axis. When no EB is present, as in the case after demagnetization displayed in Fig. 8(c),

the hysteresis loops are similar to what we have observed in Fig. 2(b). However, as EB

becomes present, one needs to consider the interplay between EB and UMA. According to

theoretical studies,[47, 55] the look of the transverse MOKE hysteresis loop with the ﬁeld

applied orthogonal to the EB direction depends on the relative strength of UMA to EB and

the angle between their directions. UMA tends to exert a torque to rotate the moments, and

hence should result in opposite signs of the magnetization along the direction orthogonal

to the external ﬁeld when EB is small, provided that the angle between the directions of

UMA and EB is large enough (>∼15◦). If the angle between them is too small, or if EB

is strong compared to UMA, the direction of the magnetization is determined dominantly

by EB instead, leading to the same sign of the magnetization along the Kerr-sensitivity

direction (i.e., parallel or antiparallel to EB) during both reversals. For the intact area B,

the Kerr signal has the same sign during both reversals of its transverse MOKE hysteresis

loop, which is positive in Fig. 8(d) and negative in 8(e). This is probably because the angle

between the UMA (i.e., the easy axis) and the EB (set by the initial high ﬁeld) is small

(∼15◦). For the plasma-treated area A, however, each transverse MOKE hysteresis loop

exhibits both positive and negative branches. This may be explained by the new UMA

created after plasma treatment, as implied in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), which has a direction at

a much larger angle of ∼45◦ to the EB. The phenomenon of the interplay between EB and

UMA further conﬁrms the eﬀectiveness of our microscopic magnetic-property modulation

method that conveniently utilizes lithographed plasma treatment on the Fe oxide/FePd thin

ﬁlms. The drastic diﬀerence in the microscopic magnetization behavior between the two

cases with and without EB permits a practical switch from one mode of magnetic-domain

behavior to another by simply turing EB on or oﬀ at room temperature.

17

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we demonstrate control of magnetic domain structures of magnetically

micro-patterned Fe oxide/FePd thin ﬁlms through e-beam lithography and O2- or Ar-plasma

treatment of the surface. Transverse MOKE measurements with the magnetic ﬁeld applied

along the direction close to the magnetic hard axis reveal that the magnetic ﬁeld required

to reverse the magnetization of the plasma-treated areas inside the 50 × 50 µm2 squares

in periodic arrays is larger than that for the untreated areas, except that the untreated

areas that are aligned with the treated squares along the easy axis are magnetically coupled

with the squares. This results in periodic stripes of domains observed in the transverse

MOKE images during magnetization reversal. Besides, an intriguing competition between

the uniaxial anisotropy and the exchange bias is observed in our system, and can be micro-

scopically controlled by altering the magnetic anisotropy via lithographed plasma treatment.

The method of surface patterning with plasma treatment for magnetic-domain engineering

may be applied in design and fabrication of future data-storage and spintronic devices.
