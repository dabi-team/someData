Amorphous oxide thin ﬁlms play a fundamental role in state-of-the art interferometry experiments,
such as gravitational wave detectors where these ﬁlms compose the high reﬂectance mirrors of end
and input masses. The sensitivity of these detectors is aﬀected by thermal noise in the mirrors
with its main source being the mechanical loss of the high index layers. These thermally driven
ﬂuctuations are a fundamental limit to optical interferometry experiments and there is a pressing
need to understand the underlying processes that lead to mechanical dissipation in materials at room
temperature. Two strategies are known to lower the mechanical loss: employing a mixture of Ta2O5
with ≈ 20% of TiO2 and post-deposition annealing, but the reasons behind this are not completely
understood. In this work, we present a systematic study of the structural and optical properties of
ion beam sputtered TiO2-doped Ta2O5 ﬁlms as a function of the annealing temperature. We show
for the ﬁrst time that low mechanical loss is associated with a material morphology that consists
of nanometer sized Ar-rich bubbles embedded into an atomically homogeneous mixed titanium-
tantalum oxide. When the Ti cation ratio is high, however, phase separation occurs in the ﬁlm
which leads to increased mechanical loss. These results indicate that for designing low mechanical
loss mixed oxide coatings for interferometry applications it would be beneﬁcial to identify materials
with the ability to form ternary compounds while the dopant ratio needs to be kept low to avoid
phase separation.

INTRODUCTION

Amorphous oxide coatings play a fundamental role in
a wide range of optical systems, from high power lasers
to quantum circuits. In particular, mixed oxide materi-
als have attracted much attention due to the potential
to tune their optical properties by varying the dopant
concentration. These coatings have found their way into
diverse applications such as laser-damage-resistant coat-
ings [1], thin ﬁlm transistors [2] and high reﬂectance mir-

rors in gravitational-wave detectors [3].
these mirrors constitute the end masses of the interferom-
eters of both Advanced LIGO [4] and Advanced Virgo [5].
The oxide coatings take on a major role in these state-of-
the-art experiments as the mechanical damping in these
materials leads to the Brownian motion noise which de-
creases the sensitivity of the detectors. The thermally
driven ﬂuctuations (thermal noise) lead to optical path
length variations and are a fundamental limit to many op-
tical interferometry experiments [6, 7] including atomic
clocks [8]. There is a pressing need to understand the
underlying processes that lead to mechanical dissipation
in these materials. In the case of gravitational wave de-
tectors, the main source of thermal noise is found in the
mechanical loss of the high index material in the stack
and is currently the ultimate barrier to improve design
sensitivity [9].

Currently there are two known processes that lead to
a reduction in the mechanical losses of high index oxide
coatings: post deposition thermal treatment (annealing)
and doping.
In the ﬁrst case, annealing has been re-
ported to signiﬁcantly reduce the mechanical loss of the
high index material in the reﬂective stack in addition to
decreasing stress and optical absorption [10, 11]. In par-
ticular for tantala (Ta2O5) ﬁlms it has been found that
annealing has the strongest eﬀect on the reduction of
the coating loss angle, even when ﬁlms are grown at ele-
vated substrate temperatures [12]. In the second case, it
was found that by doping tantala with 20-25% of titania
(TiO2) the mechanical losses could be reduced by around
40% [4, 13, 14]. This led to designing the high reﬂectance
mirrors in both Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo to
be composed of alternating layers of silica (SiO2) and
titania-doped tantala (TiO2:Ta2O5). The thermal noise
reduction achieved due to the use of this particular mixed
oxide coating has contributed to an increased sensitivity
of the observatories which was instrumental to recent ma-
jor detections [15].

The causes of the reduction in mechanical loss achieved
with titania doping and the role of the dopant concen-
tration in the material mechanical loss are not yet un-
derstood. Harry et. al. evaluated ﬁlms with diﬀerent
titania concentrations up to 55% with all coatings sub-
jected to annealing in air at 600◦C, and reported that
the mechanical loss reached a minimum for this speciﬁc
dopant concentration of around 20% [3]. Several au-
thors conﬁrmed this decrease in mechanical loss as well
[13, 14, 16–19]. There are however, only a few studies

on the structure and properties of titania-doped tantala
ﬁlms and their relation to mechanical loss.
Investiga-
tions of structural modiﬁcations of titania-doped tantala
using transmission electron microscopy by Bassiri et. al
showed that Ti doping, in particular cation ratios around
0.2 - 0.3, promotes structural homogeneity at the nearest-
neighbor level which seems to correlate with low mechan-
ical loss. In their study the ﬁlm with the lowest mechan-
ical loss (Ti/Ta cation ratio of 0.283) was also the least
oxygen deﬁcient, suggesting that Ti doping might pre-
vent oxygen loss which also contributes to lowering the
mechanical loss [20]. On follow up work Bassiri et. al.
found that annealing of the ﬁlms did not greatly aﬀect the
structure, only subtle changes in the short-order were ob-
served, but proposed that the medium range order could
show signiﬁcant changes as a function of the annealing
temperature [21]. Modeling and experiments in zirconia
doped tantala have conﬁrmed that modiﬁcations in the
medium range order that result in more corner sharing
tetrahedra favors low room temperature mechanical loss
in that mixture [22].

Herein we report the results of a detailed study of the
evolution in the atomic structure, morphology, optical
properties and mechanical loss of reactively sputtered
titania-doped tantala upon annealing. It is shown that
for a dopant cation concentration of 0.27, the anneal-
ing process induces atomic mixing leading to the forma-
tion of a titania-tantala compound, while for a higher
cation concentration of 0.53 the ﬁlm can be regarded as
a molecular mixture of titania and tantala. The crystal-
lized phase for the ﬁlm with the lowest cation concen-
tration is indexed as TiTa18O47. Instead, the ﬁlm with
the highest dopant concentration is phase separated with
only the titania crystallizing at 500◦C. At an annealing
temperature of 600◦C, where the structural modiﬁcations
are clearly identiﬁed, the titania-doped tantala ﬁlms with
cation ratio of 0.27 achieve the lowest mechanical loss and
absorption loss at the laser interferometer wavelength of
1064 nm. At these conditions, the ﬁlms are less dense due
to the presence of Ar-rich bubbles. In combination, these
results show, for the ﬁrst time, that the lowest mechanical
loss is associated with a material morphology that con-
sists of nanometer sized Ar-rich bubbles embedded into
an atomically homogenous mixed titanium-tantalum ox-
ide, which features reduced optical loss.

II. RESULTS

Grazing incidence x-ray diﬀraction (GIXRD) results
for titania-doped tantala ﬁlms with diﬀerent cation ratio
concentrations are presented in ﬁgure 1.

The as-deposited ﬁlm with a cation dopant concentra-
tion of 0.27 shows an amorphous structure with broad
features comparable to those observed for tantala (see
Figure 1 of Supplementary Material [23]). These broad
features are unchanged up to an annealing temperature
of 600◦C. However, the main broad feature around 2θ

ature. The fused silica substrate peak position is indicated in

around 2θ = 21◦.Tabulated peak positions for the TiTa18O47
compound and for titania in the rutile phase are included.

= 16 - 40◦ is sharper and higher in intensity after an-
nealing at 700◦C, which is indicative of the onset of the
ﬁlm crystallization. In fact, annealing to 750◦C reveals
peaks superimposed over the main broad features which
indicate partial crystallization of the ﬁlm. The peaks of
the crystallized structure correspond to TiTa18O47 (PDF
00-021-1423). This compound was observed in powder
samples consisting of a mixture of tantala and titania in
varying concentrations [24]. These XRD measurements
are reported in a limited angular range, 2θ = 50◦ [23],
which do not permit indexing of three peaks observed at
higher positions in the diﬀractograms of ﬁgure 1A. The
crystal system of TiTa18O47 was identiﬁed as monoclinic.
The relative intensities of the peaks match fairly well
with the tabulated values except, for a peak expected
at 2θ = 30.03◦ which is not observed. This could be
due to the peak being superimposed with the amorphous
background still present or could also be indicative of
texture in the structure. The cation ratio necessary to
form TiTa18O47 is around 0.05 while the actual ratio of
the ﬁlm is much higher (0.27) so it is reasonable to ex-

3

pect that only a small portion of the amorphous layer has
crystallized. Figure 1B presents the GIXRD spectra for
the titania-doped tantala ﬁlm with a dopant cation ratio
of 0.53. The ﬁlms as-deposited and annealed at 300◦C
indicate an amorphous structure with the broad features
also observed for pure tantala and the mixed ﬁlm with a
lower dopant cation ratio. For an annealing temperature
of 500◦C two peaks centered at 2θ = (35.93 ± 0.03)◦ and
2θ = (53.9 ± 0.3)◦ appear, indicating that the ﬁlm is
partially crystallized. For the following annealing tem-
perature of 600◦C the diﬀractogram consists mainly of
sharp peaks with only a broad feature remaining asso-

ciated with the substrate. The peaks correspond to the
titania rutile structure with a preferential orientation in
the [101] direction. There are also signiﬁcant shifts in
peak positions that can be linked to a variation in lat-
tice parameters, as there are no clear indications of the
presence of residual stress in the ﬁlm. In this case, one of
the constituents of the mixture, titania, fully crystallizes
while the tantala remains amorphous featuring a clear
phase separation in the material. Remarkably, annealing
this ﬁlm at temperatures higher than the crystallization
temperature of pure tantala (up to 850◦C) does not in-
duce crystallization of the tantala phase.

The position and peak separation for a tantala ﬁlm are shown for reference. (B) position of Ti 2p3/2 peak and energy separation
of Ti 2p doublet in titania-doped tantala ﬁlms. The shaded region indicates the tabulated values of energy separation for Ti(IV).
Arrows indicate crystallized ﬁlms as determined by the presence of sharp peaks in the diﬀractograms.

Annealing of the titania-doped tantala ﬁlms also mod-
iﬁed the material structure observed by x-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS) from the evolution of the Ta 4f
and Ti 2p peaks. Figure 2A shows the variation of the
Ta 4f7/2 peak position and the binding energy separa-
tion between the Ta doublet for tantala and titania-doped
tantala ﬁlms as a function of the annealing temperature.
The position of the Ta 4f7/2 peak and the energy sep-
aration are well within the tabulated ranges for tantala
[25–28] in all ﬁlms at the diﬀerent annealing tempera-
tures. This indicates that the Ta oxidation state is that

of tantala and that neither the annealing nor the dopant
inclusion induce signiﬁcant changes in the chemical envi-
ronment of the Ta atoms.

A similar analysis for the Ti bonding environment in
titania-doped tantala ﬁlms is shown in ﬁgure 2B. The Ti
2p3/2 peak position versus annealing for all ﬁlms agrees
with tabulated values for Ti(IV) [25]. However, the en-
ergy separation of the doublet for the ﬁlm with a cation
ratio of 0.27 presents an interesting behavior. For the as
deposited ﬁlm the energy separation is in good agreement
with the expected energy separation for Ti(IV). After

4

annealing there is a signiﬁcant increase of the doublet
energy separation. Similar high values of energy sep-
aration have been reported for poorly oxidized titania
ﬁlms [29, 30], but in this case the position of the O 1s
and Ti 2p3/2 peaks do not correspond to a low oxida-
tion state. This indicates that the chemical environment
of the Ti atoms changes signiﬁcantly with annealing up
to the crystallization temperature and no longer corre-
sponds to a titania environment, which could be indica-
tive of an atomic mixture. After partial crystallization
of the TiTa18O47 phase the energy separation is again
within the range corresponding to Ti(IV), likely due to
the fact that a large portion of the material remains
amorphous in a tantala and a titania phase. This in-

dicates that crystallization eﬀectively breaks the atomic
mixture induced in the material by the annealing process.
For the titania-doped tantala ﬁlm with a cation ratio of
0.53, the energy separation of the doublet components are
consistent with Ti(IV) and do not show any marked de-
pendency on the annealing temperature even after com-
plete crystallization of the titania phase at 600◦C. The
energy separation measured after annealing at 500◦C is
only deviated by 1σ from the tabulated values, which
is not statistically signiﬁcant. This indicates that the
Ti atoms are in a titania chemical environment in the
as-deposited ﬁlms and after annealing, regardless of its
structure being amorphous or partially crystallized.

ﬁlm with a cation ratio = 0.53 as deposited and after annealing. All TEM images are bright ﬁeld except speciﬁed. (D) Relative
variation of refractive index at λ = 1064 nm and thickness of the coatings for diﬀerent annealing temperatures before the onset

Annealing of the titania-doped tantala ﬁlms brings
further structural modiﬁcations. Figure 3 shows trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the cross
section of tantala and titania-doped tantala ﬁlms as de-
posited and after annealing at their corresponding high-
est temperatures before the onset of crystallization. As
expected, the as-deposited ﬁlms present a dense mor-
phology. After annealing both the tantala ﬁlm and the
mixed ﬁlm with a cation ratio of 0.53 remain compact
with no changes in the morphology within the resolution
of the TEM images. However, the titania-doped tantala
ﬁlm with 0.27 cation concentration shows the presence of
closed bubbles with a characteristic diameter of 1 2 nm
and a surface density around 0.02 bubbles/nm2, which
are identiﬁed as dark regions in the high-angle annu-
lar dark-ﬁeld scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM/HAADF) image. These bubbles lead to a reduc-
tion of the packing density in the ﬁlm. This is supported
by the fact that the refractive index decreases and the
ﬁlm thickness increases with annealing temperature as
shown in ﬁgure 3D. The refractive index at λ = 1064

nm wavelength is reduced by almost 2% between the as
deposited and annealed ﬁlms and is accompanied by an
increase in thickness of 7%. In contrast, both the tantala
and titania-doped tantala with 0.53 cation ratio feature
no signiﬁcant changes in the refractive index or thickness
after annealing. An analysis of the refractive index by
means of the Wiener bounds approach [31] (Supplemen-
tary Material S3) indicates that the packing density is
reduced to (0.97 ± 0.02) while a reduction in the refrac-
tive index is expected only for bubbles larger than 1 nm,
which is consistent with the bubbles dimensions deter-
mined from the TEM images of ﬁgure 3B. Bubble for-
mation induced by annealing has been reported for other
sputtered oxide thin ﬁlms [11, 32–34] but not for mixed
ﬁlms. In this case, the dopant cation ratio appears to be
a key contributing factor to bubble formation. Even at
lower annealing temperatures, the mixed ﬁlm with 0.27
cation ratio already exhibits a clear increase in thickness
in contrast with the tantala ﬁlm and the mixed ﬁlm with
0.53 cation ratio.

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis for

5

annealing process [36, 37]. In particular, for the tantala
ﬁlm, this decrease in absorption can be associated with
an increase of around 8% in the lattice oxygen proportion
as determined by XPS (Supplementary Information S2).
In fact, in the current state-of-the-art coatings for grav-
itational wave interferometers, the absorption loss was
reduced from 0.7 ppm to 0.25 ppm when the tantala lay-
ers of the mirrors were replaced by titania-doped tantala
[18].

Dopant cation ratio and annealing also have a pro-
found impact in the mechanical loss of the coatings. The
mechanical loss of a material is given by the loss angle
(φ), the ratio of the imaginary to real parts of the Youngs
modulus, which is characteristic of the frequency depen-
dent mechanical damping. The loss angle relates to the
dissipated power as a fraction 2πφ of the stored energy in
the test mass is being dissipated during each cycle [38].

Figure 5. Coating loss angle at 1 kHz for a tantala ﬁlm and
titania-doped tantala ﬁlms with dopant cation ratio of 0.27
and 0.53 as a function of the annealing temperature.

The coating loss angle at a frequency around 1 kHz as a
function of annealing temperature for tantala and titania-
doped tantala ﬁlms is presented in ﬁgure 5. For an as-
deposited tantala coating the loss angle is (9.7 ± 0.9) ×
10−4 and reduces to (4.7 ± 0.3) × 10−4 after annealing
at 500◦C, in good agreement with reported values [3,
19]. The loss angle for the as deposited titania-doped
tantala ﬁlms is lower than for tantala, around 6.9 7.2 ×
10−4. After annealing at 500◦C the loss angle for both
doped ﬁlms is decreased and remains lower than that
of tantala. However, after annealing at 600◦C, the loss
angle of the ﬁlm with a cation ratio of 0.53 increases to
(13 ± 1) × 10−4. In contrast, the titania-doped tantala
ﬁlm with a cation ratio of 0.27 shows a marked decrease
reaching a value of (2.8 ± 0.3) × 10−4 which is roughly
a reduction of 40% in the loss angle compared to the
annealed tantala ﬁlm. This reduction is comparable to
previously reported values for titania-doped tantala with
a dopant concentration around 20% grown by ion beam
sputtering (IBS) [3, 13–19].
It is relevant to point out
that at 600◦C the 0.27 cation ratio titania-doped tantala
reaches lower values of the loss angle and the absorption

a titania-doped tantala ﬁlm with a cation ratio = 0.27
after annealing show the bubbles are mostly ﬁlled with
Ar, as can be observed in ﬁgure 4. The compositional
maps have Ar-rich regions that roughly correspond to
dark regions in the HAADF/STEM image. This is veri-
ﬁed by the EELS spectra taken from a line proﬁle across
the surface, which show a distinct increase only in Ar
concentration that correlates with the lowest intensity
regions in the HAADF/STEM image. The atomic con-
centrations obtained by EELS should only be considered
qualitatively as this is a standardless technique and for
quantiﬁcation careful calibration should be carried out.
From previous RBS studies done in our group, IBS ﬁlms
typically feature 3 - 5% of Ar which is in good agreement
with the detection of Ar by EELS in the ﬁlm regardless of
the presence of bubbles. During ﬁlm deposition, Ar at a
partial pressure around 4 × 10−6 Torr is used to operate
the ion source. The entrapped Ar in the ﬁlm can be due
to chemisorbed Ar or implanted Ar reﬂected oﬀ the tar-
get. The elevated Ar concentration in the bubbles could
be due to aggregation induced by the annealing process.
The eﬀect of doping and annealing on the optical prop-
erties of the ﬁlms was characterized. Table I summarizes
the values of the refractive index at λ = 1064 nm, the
optical band gap and absorption loss at λ = 1064 nm
normalized to a thickness of 250 nm for the as-deposited
ﬁlms and after annealing at the highest temperature be-
fore crystallization. For tantala the refractive index and
band gap agree well with reported values for ﬁlms grown
by reactive sputtering [35]. The refractive indices of the
mixed ﬁlms follow the expected scaling with Ti doping.
The absorption loss at λ = 1064 nm for tantala and
titania-doped tantala with a cation ratio of 0.27 is in the
parts per million for as-deposited ﬁlms and reduces upon
annealing. This results in part from reduction of the con-
centration of oxygen defects in the thin ﬁlms due to the

III. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The results of the characterization of titania-doped
tantala thin ﬁlms presented in the previous section pro-
vide valuable insight into the structural modiﬁcations
that occur with annealing and doping. In tantala ﬁlms,
there is an 8% increase in the lattice oxygen concentra-
tion upon annealing that suggests that oxygen rearrange-
ment induced by the thermal treatment is taking place.
This oxygen rearrangement occurs while the structure of
the ﬁlm remains amorphous. Although the changes in
the absorption loss and refractive index at λ = 1064 nm,
or the band gap are minimal, the oxygen rearrangement
decreases mechanical loss.

The addition of titania to tantala adds other vari-
ables that inﬂuence the properties of the materials that
strongly depend on dopant concentration. For the high-
est 0.53 cation ratio the as-deposited ﬁlms are a mixture
of tantala and titania and thus a phase separated mate-
rial. Beyond 500◦C titania crystalizes in its rutile phase
while tantala remains amorphous. This is consistent with
previous reports that showed elevated titania concentra-
tions can lead to phase separation in sol-gel ﬁlms [39].
The mechanical loss of the as-deposited ﬁlm is lower than
for a tantala ﬁlm but after annealing at 500◦C it reaches
a similar value. The high absorption loss at λ = 1064
nm for the as-deposited ﬁlm may indicate a lack of oxy-
gen, which is partially compensated by annealing at at-
mospheric conditions, but not suﬃciently to reduce the
absorption loss to parts per million as in tantala.

The titania-doped tantala ﬁlm with a cation ratio of
0.27 shows the most signiﬁcant structural modiﬁcations
with annealing. The material evolves from a mixture of
tantala and titania to an atomically homogenous mate-
rial after annealing up to 650◦C. This is evidenced by
the fact that the chemical environment of the Ti atoms
is no longer consistent with a titania conﬁguration. This
supports previous research that suggested that tantala
and titania are mixed at the atomic scale [20, 39]. More-
over, the ternary compound TiTa18O47 crystallizes after
annealing at 700◦C. The thermal treatment also induces
the formation of Ar-rich bubbles with a characteristic

[41], and by Harthcock et. al.

diameter of 1 2 nm and a surface density around 0.02
bubbles/nm2. This eﬀect has not been previously re-
ported for the mixed oxide ﬁlms but was suggested as a
possible cause for the measured variation in the Youngs
modulus of a 25% titania-doped tantala ﬁlm [40]. Simi-
lar features were reported in a tantala ﬁlm grown by IBS
in
by MacLaren et. al.
IBS HfO2 ﬁlms [42]. Recent simulation eﬀorts indicate
that the presence and distribution of bubbles might con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the coating loss angle of the mate-
rial [43]. Jiang et. al. studied zirconia doped tantala and
found that annealing not only promotes homogeneity by
modifying the chemical environment of the Zr atoms but
also allows for a homogenous distribution of voids, re-
sulting in decreased mechanical loss. The voids reported
in that study, however, are smaller than the ones found
in titania-doped tantala as the size of the simulation sys-
tem is roughly a 2 nm box and thus cannot reproduce
nanometer sized voids. Further studies are needed to
elucidate the role of voids in the loss angle of the mixed
oxide coatings.

In combination the results show that the presence of
Ar-rich bubbles and the atomic mixing of titania and
tantala with a cation ratio of 0.27 result in a material
that has the minimum coating loss angle and absorp-
tion loss at λ = 1064 nm. Higher Ti cation ratio leads
to phase separation which in turn increases mechanical
loss. Therefore a path towards identifying promising
mixed amorphous oxide thin ﬁlms with low mechanical
loss would need to account for the thermodynamics of
ternary phase formation that could promote atomic mix-
ing. A high crystallization temperature alone might not
predictive of low mechanical loss and dopant cation ratio
should be kept low to avoid phase separation in the ﬁlm.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

A. Film deposition

The titania-doped tantala ﬁlms with cation ratio of 0,
0.27, 0.53 and tantala ﬁlms were deposited by reactive bi-
ased target deposition (RBTD) [44, 45] using the LANS
system manufactured by 4Wave, Inc. The RBTD tech-
nique involves the use of a low energy ion source that

generates an Ar ion plume that is directed at a nega-
tively biased metallic target to sputter the target. The
deposition system ﬁts six 100 mm diameter metallic tar-
gets with a mobile shutter that exposes three targets at
a time. Metallic targets are biased using an asymmet-
ric, bipolar pulsed DC power supply. The same negative
bias is applied to the exposed targets but the positive
pulse width and period can be individually controlled.
For mixed ﬁlms the Ti and Ta targets were operated si-
multaneously but the individual pulse widths were varied
to realize diﬀerent mixture proportions of the materials
while the pulse period was ﬁxed at 100 µs. The O2 ﬂow
was optimized for each deposition condition in order to
optimize optical properties. The base pressure was 1 ×
10−7 Torr while the process pressure was around 6 ×
10−4 Torr. The pulse width at which the Ta/Ti targets
were biased to achieve the desired composition, and de-
position conditions evaluated in this work are presented
in Table II. The deposition rates of the ﬁlms ranged from
0.004 - 0.02 nm/s. The dopant cation ratio, deﬁned as the
ratio between the titanium concentration and the sum of
the titanium and tantalum concentrations (Ti/(Ti+Ta)),
was obtained from the analysis of XPS spectra.

Film thickness was kept around 200 - 250 nm for tan-
tala and titania-doped tantala ﬁlms and around 120 nm
for titania ﬁlms. Coatings were grown on Si (100) wafers
for XPS measurements and on fused silica substrates of
25.4 mm diameter and 6.35 mm thick for the rest of the
structural and optical characterization techniques em-
ployed. For mechanical loss measurements 75 mm diame-
ter and 1 mm thick fused silica substrates were employed.
Post-deposition annealing in air was carried out using a
Fisher Scientiﬁc Isotemp programmable muﬄe furnace in
which the temperature was increased at a rate of 100◦C
per hour until a soaking temperature of 300◦C, 500◦C,
600◦C, 650◦C, 700◦C and 750◦C was reached. For each
temperature a soaking time of 10 hours was used.

B. GIXRD measurements

GIXRD measurements were carried out on a Bruker
D8 Discover Series I diﬀractometer with a Cu Kα source.
The incident angle was kept at 0.5◦ and 2θ was varied be-
tween 10◦ and 80◦. In this conﬁguration the x-ray inten-
sity is 90% attenuated in a length of 340 nm of tantala
and 720 nm of titania. Results for tantala and titania
ﬁlms are described in the Supplementary Material sec-
tion.

C. XPS measurements

XPS measurements were performed using a Physical
Electronics PE 5800 ESCA/ASE system equipped with
a monochromatic Al Kα x-ray source. The photoelectron
take-oﬀ angle was ﬁxed at 45◦ and a charge neutralizer

7

was used with a current of 10 µA for all measurements.
The instrument base pressure was around 1 × 10−9 Torr.
Spectra were analyzed using CasaXPS software (version
2.3.19) [46]. An in-depth analysis of XPS data is de-
scribed in the Supplementary Material.

D. TEM and EELS measurements

TEM and EELS measurements were performed by Eu-
roﬁns Materials Science. The samples were prepared us-
ing the in situ focused ion beam (FIB) lift out technique
on a FEI Strata 400 Dual Beam FIB/SEM. The samples
were imaged with a FEI Tecnai TF-20 FEG/TEM oper-
ated at 200 kV in bright-ﬁeld TEM mode and high-angle
annular dark-ﬁeld STEM mode.

E. Optical measurements

Optical characterization of the ﬁlms was realized by
spectroscopic ellipsometry along with measurements of
absorption loss at λ = 1064 nm and transmittance. El-
lipsometric data were collected at an angle of incidence
of 60◦ using a Horiba UVISEL ellipsometer in a spectral
range of 0.59 eV to 6.5 eV. The ﬁtting of spectroscopic el-
lipsometry data was performed using the DeltaPsi2 soft-
ware and several dispersion models for the materials were
evaluated to obtain ﬁlm thickness, refractive index and
extinction coeﬃcient. From the dispersion of the extinc-
tion coeﬃcient, the energy band gap was estimated by
the Tauc method [47] for indirect transitions and further
veriﬁed by the Cody method [48] when the range of lin-
ear dependency could not be determined unambiguously
from the Tauc plot. The Supplementary Material sec-
tion describes the analysis of these results. Absorption
loss was measured at λ = 1064 nm by photothermal com-
mon path interferometry [49]. For each sample ﬁve spots
were measured in the surface in a 4 mm × 4 mm area.

F. Mechanical loss measurements

Mechanical loss measurements were performed at the
LIGO Laboratory (Caltech) using a gentle nodal suspen-
sion system [50, 51] for as deposited ﬁlms and after an-
nealing at diﬀerent temperatures.
In all cases, various
resonant modes were measured in a frequency range of 1
- 22 kHz.
