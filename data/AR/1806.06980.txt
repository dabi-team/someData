ABSTRACT

The diﬀusion of atoms and molecules in ices covering dust grains in dense clouds in interstellar
space is an important but poorly characterized step in the formation of complex molecules in space.
Here we report the measurement of diﬀusion of simple molecules in amorphous solid water (ASW),
an analog of interstellar ices, which are amorphous and made mostly of water molecules. The new
approach that we used relies on measuring in situ the change in band strength and position of mid-
infrared features of OH dangling bonds as molecules move through pores and channels of ASW. We
obtained the Arrhenius pre-exponents and activation energies for diﬀusion of CO, O2, N2, CH4, and
Ar in ASW. The diﬀusion energy barrier of H2 and D2 were also measured, but only upper limits
were obtained. These values constitute the ﬁrst comprehensive set of diﬀusion parameters of simple
molecules on the pore surface of ASW, and can be used in simulations of the chemical evolution of
ISM environments, thus replacing unsupported estimates. We also present a set of argon temperature
programmed desorption experiments to determine the desorption energy distribution of argon on non-
porous ASW.

1. INTRODUCTION

In the Interstellar Medium (ISM), there are molecules
that are complex enough to be considered as the build-
ing blocks of key molecules in the origin of life (Chiar
1997). Astronomical observations, computer modeling,
and laboratory experiments have all shown clearly that
many of these interstellar complex organic molecules
(ICOMs) are originated from the ice mantle covering
cosmic dust grains in dense clouds (Herbst 2014).
In
such environments where there is little penetration of
UV light and the gas temperature is low (<50 K), gas-
phase reactions are ineﬃcient, and ices’ advantage in

K) for a long time, is clear. However, except for a few
cases, the processes leading to the formation of these
complex molecules in ices are either unknown or still in-
suﬃciently characterized. One poorly understood step
in molecule formation is the diﬀusion of reactants in/on
ices. In the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, which is
the most important mechanism in gas-grain astrochemi-
cal modeling, the rate of reactions is largely determined
by the diﬀusion rate of reactants on the surface. After
gas phase radicals and molecules accrete on the ice man-
tle, they diﬀuse on the surface or penetrate into the ice
to react with each other. The rate of diﬀusion governs
how fast chemical reactions take place in the solid state
and the abundance of ICOMs in the ice mantle. Yet, the
process of diﬀusion under typical dense cloud conditions
in the ISM is poorly characterized.

The most common molecule that has been detected in
interstellar ices is water, followed by CO, CO2, CH3OH,
CH4, and NH3. N2 and O2 should also be present, but
it is hard to establish their abundance from the infrared

(Boogert et al. 2015). Observations of the absorption of
the OH vibrational stretch in the infrared have shown
that the structure of ice in the ISM is mostly amorphous
(Hagen et al. 1981). In the laboratory, water ice grown
by water vapor deposition at a temperature lower than
140 K is commonly referred to as amorphous solid wa-
∼
ter (ASW). Depending on the temperature, it may have
a porous structure with a large surface area per unit vol-
ume, and the lower the deposition temperature is, the
higher is the porosity (Ayotte et al. 2001; Raut et al.
2007; Bossa et al. 2014). To some extent, details of the
amorphous ice morphology depend on the preparation
methods (Kimmel et al. 2001). As the temperature of
the ice is raised, pores collapse and the ice compacts
(Bossa et al. 2012). In space, compaction can also be in-
duced by cosmic rays (Palumbo 2005; Raut et al. 2008).
The non-detection in the ISM of dangling OH (dOH)
bands in the infrared (Keane et al. 2001) —indicative
of porous ASW (Buch & Devlin 1991)—seems at ﬁrst
to argue against the porous hypothesis. However, ex-
periments by Bossa et al. (2014) found that the missing
of dOH bonds does not necessarily mean that the ice
is fully compact. The presence of these pores in inter-
stellar ices is important because they have the potential
to absorb a large number of molecules, and are also the
conduits for molecules to move and undergo chemical re-
actions. The very rich chemistry in the interstellar space
seems to agree with the hypothesis that the ice mantle is
porous, at least to some extent. Diﬀusion of molecules
or radicals on the pore surface of interstellar ices is a
key process in order to understand chemical reactions
in the solid state in the ISM. In this work, we study the
diﬀusion of simple molecules in ASW with the purpose
to obtain parameters of the diﬀusion process, such as
the pre-exponent factor D0 and activation energy Edif
in the Arrhenius expression for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
D(T ) = D0e− Edif
kT , that are important in simulations of
the chemical evolution of ices (Garrod & Herbst 2006;
Garrod et al. 2008; Garrod & Pauly 2011).

There exist a few attempts to quantify the diﬀusion
of simple molecules on/in ices. Livingston et al. (2002)
used laser resonant desorption to follow the bulk diﬀu-
sion of NH3 and CH3OH molecules from a layer of NH3
or CH3OH sandwiched in water ice between 140 and
180 K. This temperature region is much higher than
the typical temperature in dense clouds, and it is hard
to extrapolate their experimental data to dense cloud
conditions. Mispelaer et al. (2013) deposited a thick
layer of water on top of target molecules CO, NH3,
H2CO, or HNCO. By heating, the target molecules mi-
grated through the ice and desorbed into vacuum. In-
frared absorption of these molecules was measured in

order to quantify the desorption of molecules from the
ice. Fick’s law of diﬀusion was used to simulate the ex-
periments, and the diﬀusion energy barriers as well as
the pre-exponential factors in the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
were obtained. Their work is an important step to-
ward the understanding of diﬀusion in water ice. How-
ever, it suﬀers from two complications: 1) In their ex-
periments, desorption and diﬀusion are intimately en-
twined, and it is hard to separate the eﬀect of one
from the other; 2) During the measurement, the wa-
ter ice structure may be changing;
it is unclear how
the changes aﬀect the experiments. Following a simi-
lar procedure, Karssemeijer et al. (2014) measured the
diﬀusion of CO in porous water ice. Lauck et al. (2015)
extended the work of Karssemeijer et al. (2014) and pre-
sented a systematic study of CO diﬀusion in ASW.
Rather than looking into the desorption of CO from the
ice as in Mispelaer et al. (2013), Lauck et al. (2015) dis-
tinguished the IR absorption of CO molecules that inter-
acted with CO from those interacting with the surface
of pore in water ice. By performing a set of isother-
mal experiments, they quantiﬁed the diﬀusion of CO in
porous ASW. They attributed the diﬀusion to be sur-
face diﬀusion along pores. Lauck et al. (2015) avoided
the ﬁrst complication of Mispelaer et al. (2013) men-
tioned above, but not the second one. Most recently,
Cooke et al. (2018) utilized the change in the CO2 ν3
band proﬁle induced by CO as a probe to study the dif-
fusion of CO in CO2 ice. They found the diﬀusion energy
40 K, which is 0.18–0.24 times of the
barrier to be 300
binding energy of CO on non-porous ASW at low sur-
face coverages (He et al. 2016). In all of the three stud-
ies, the mechanism was found to be diﬀusion along the
pore surfaces instead of diﬀusion in bulk ice. The pene-
tration of molecules through porous media is also called
percolation. In this work, we adopt the term “diﬀusion”
that is more familiar to the astronomical community.

±

Rigorously speaking, the above experiments do not
necessarily measure the same diﬀusion processes as in
interstellar conditions. In a typically experiment to mea-
sure diﬀusion, the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction dom-
inates over adsorbate-adsorbent interaction, and the dif-
fusion is mostly concentration driven. In contrast, un-
der realistic interstellar conditions, the surface coverage
of adsorbate is usually very low, and the adsorbate-

would like to measure the tracer diﬀusion coeﬃcient,
which describes the random walk of a particle. To ap-
proximate this condition and obtain diﬀusion parame-
ters that are applicable to interstellar conditions, the
surface coverage of that particle in an experiment has
to be low, unless the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction is

signiﬁcantly weaker than the adsorbate-adsorbent one.
In a prior work, we studied the diﬀusion of low cov-
erage CO2 on compact ASW surface (He et al. 2017).
Although the CO2-CO2 interaction was found to be
stronger than the CO2-H2O interaction, in the exper-
iment the CO2 coverage was limited to 0.23 monolayer
(ML). The diﬀusion parameters should still apply to in-
terstellar conditions. However, due to limited experi-
mental data, we couldn’t determine the pre-exponent
factor ν and the diﬀusion energy barrier Edif in the dif-
fusion rate Γ = νe− Edif
kT at the same time. The dif-
fusion energy barrier Edif was calculated assuming the
pre-exponential factor ν of 1012 s−1, which is the typical
value of the vibrational frequency of a weakly adsorbed
particle on a surface.
In the study reported here, we
measure the diﬀusion rate D(T ) of CO, N2, O2, CH4,
and Ar on the surface of pores in porous ASW, and de-
termine both the pre-exponent factor D0 and activation
energy barrier Edif for the diﬀusion. For these adsorbate
molecules, the adsorbate-adsorbent interaction is about
1.5–2 times stronger than the adsorbate-adsorbate in-
teraction (He et al. 2016). We also chose the deposition
dose so that the coverage is less than full coverage of the
surface area of the ASW sample, as an eﬀort to study
the diﬀusion that is close to that in the interstellar con-
dition.

In the next Section, the experimental results are pre-
sented, followed by modeling of the experimental using
Fick’s law of diﬀusion. Finally, we comment on how
these results should be used in simulations of the chem-
ical evolution of ISM ices.

2. EXPERIMENTAL

×

Experiments were performed using a ultra-high vac-
uum (UHV) setup located at Syracuse University.
A detailed description can be found in prior works
(He & Vidali 2018a,b); here we brieﬂy summarize the
features that are relevant to this study. The main ultra-
high vacuum (UHV) chamber reaches a base pressure
10−10 torr. At the center of the UHV chamber,
of 4
a gold coated copper disk was used as the sample onto
which ice was grown. The sample can be cooled down to
4.8 K using a closed cycle helium cryostat. A cartridge
heater installed right underneath the sample is used to
heat the sample. A silicone diode located right under-
neath the sample disk and a Lakeshore 336 temperature
controller was used to measure the temperature to an
accuracy better than 50 mK and to control the heating
of the sample. Water vapor and other gas molecules
were deposited from two separate UHV precision leak
valves. Distilled water underwent at least three freeze-
pump-thaw cycles before being sent into the chamber.

The gas/vapor deposition was controlled accurately by
using a stepper motor connected to the leak valves. A
LabVIEW program measures the chamber pressure and
calculates the thickness in real time. Typically, the
relative accuracy of gas deposition is better than 0.1%.
Water deposition has a larger uncertainty of 1% because
of the instability of the water inlet pressure. For all of
the experiments in this study, gas was deposited from
the background. The deposition dose was calculated
from the impingement rate (IP R):

IP R =

P
√2πmkBT

(1)

where P is the chamber pressure, m is the mass of gas
molecule, and T is the gas temperature (assumed to be
room temperature). The impingement rate has the unit
of molecules per unit surface area per unit time. It can
be converted to ML/s by assuming 1 ML = 1015 cm−2.
The chamber pressure was recorded using a hot cath-
ode ion gauge. For each gas, the measured pressure
was corrected for the ionization cross section of that
gas. The main source of uncertainty in thickness comes
from the pressure gauge. An absolute uncertainty of
up to 30% is possible for this type of gauge. A Nicolet
6700 FTIR in the Reﬂection Absorption Infrared Spec-
troscopy (RAIRS) setup was used to monitor the ice.
The FTIR scans and averages 8 spectra every 10 sec-
onds at a resolution of 0.5 or 1.0 cm−1.

A set of volatile gases and water vapor co-deposition
experiments were performed to ﬁnd out how the inclu-
sion of volatile molecules in the water ice aﬀects the dOH
bands of water. 100 ML of water and 30 ML of volatile
molecules were deposited simultaneously onto the gold
sample when the surface was at 10 K. The RAIR spectra
were measured after deposition without warming up the
ice. The volatile molecules used in this study are: CO,
CH4, N2, O2, Ar, D2, and H2.

The shifting of dOH by a volatile molecule was ex-
ploited to measure the diﬀusion on the ASW surface.
Water was deposited from the background when the
sample was at 10 K. After 200 ML of water deposition,
the ice was annealed at 70 K for 30 minutes before fur-
ther experiments. The purpose of annealing the ice to
70 K is:

•

To ensure the water ice structure does not change
during the whole diﬀusion experiment. We tried to
anneal an ASW sample at 70 K for 2.5 hours, and
found that most of the changes in dOH happens
during the ﬁrst 30 minutes. When the ice is cooled
down to 10–25 K range for diﬀusion measurement,
the change in ice structure should be negligible.
Our measurements of diﬀusion are diﬀerent from

4

He et al.

the experiments by Lauck et al. (2015), in which
CO diﬀusion and ASW pore collapse happen si-
multaneously, and it was not possible to separate
the eﬀect of pore collapse from the diﬀusion of CO.

•

•

After annealing at 70 K, the 2-coordinated dOH
band at 3720 cm−1 is almost gone, and only the
3-coordinated dOH band persists; we only need
to deal with the shifting in position of one band
instead of two bands, therefore making the data
analysis simpler. More discussion about the shift-
ing of dOH are in the next section.

At 70 K, the pore surface area as well as the dOH
band intensity are still appreciable, giving reason-
able signal to noise ratio for the diﬀusion measure-
ment. This is the reason to anneal at 70 K instead
of at higher temperatures.

∼

After annealing at 70 K, the ASW samples were cooled
down to 10 K for the deposition of a volatile gas, except
for H2 and D2, which were deposited when the annealed
ASW was at 4.8 K. The dOH band of the annealed wa-
ter is red shifted from 3697 cm−1 to
3694 cm−1 after
annealing. These volatile molecules deposited on top of
the annealed water ice are not mobile (except for H2
and D2), and they build up as pure layers of ice. Just
after the deposition of the volatiles the dOH absorption
is mostly at the pure water dOH position —3694 cm−1,
with a small fraction of shifted dOH due to the pen-
etration of molecules in the topmost layers. The dose
of CO, N2, and Ar were ﬁxed at 16 ML, and those for
CH4 and O2 at 20 ML. According to our measurement
(He & Vidali 2018b), 20 ML of molecules occupy most of
the dOH sites on the pore surface. After deposition at 10
K, we waited until the residual volatile molecules in the
chamber were completely pumped away before heating
up the ice quickly at a ramp rate of 0.5 K/s to the de-
sired isothermal experiment temperature and remained
at this temperature for 30 minutes. The overshooting
in temperature is less than 0.2 K. RAIRS spectra were
collected in a 10 seconds time resolution to monitor the
change in dOH bands.

Their positions are listed in Table 1.

position. The N2 molecules are mostly on top of the
ASW in the pure form. Only a small fraction of N2 are
interacting with the water ice surface. After isothermal
experiment at a suﬃciently high temperature (but still
lower than the desorption temperature) for a set period
of time, N2 diﬀuses into the ASW along the pore sur-
faces, and evenly covers the pore surface of the ASW.
The original dOH band at 3694 cm−1 is mostly shifted
to 3672 cm−1, which is blue shifted by a few cm−1 with
respect to the shifted 3-coordinated dOH at 3668 cm−1
as shown in Table 1. Other molecules also show simi-
lar blue shifts as N2, i.e., the shifted dOH positions on
annealed ASW are slightly shifted respect to the shifted
3-coordinated dOH positions in Table 1. Figure 2 also
shows the ﬁtting of the spectra. A broad Gaussian and a
broad Lorentzian function are used to ﬁt the blue wing of
the bulk water absorption. The original dOH band and
the shifted one are each ﬁt using a Gaussian function.
This ﬁtting scheme is applied to each spectrum collected
in the whole experiment to trace the diﬀusion of N2 in
the ASW. The band area of the shifted dOH band at
3672 cm −1 and the original dOH band at 3694 cm−1
during the isothermal experiment at each target temper-
ature are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.
It is evident that the shifting of dOH strongly depends
on the target temperature.

4. MODELING

Fick’s law of diﬀusion was used to obtain the diﬀu-
sion energy barrier as well as the pre-exponential fac-
tor D0, similar to other studies (Mispelaer et al. 2013;
Karssemeijer et al. 2014; Lauck et al. 2015). The one
dimensional Fick’s law of diﬀusion is described by the

where C(z, t) is the coverage (unitless) at depth z into
the ice. If the amount of of N2 at depth z is just enough
to cover the whole pore surface at that depth, then
C(z, t) = 1. D(T ) is the temperature dependent dif-
fusion coeﬃcient. We assume that 1 ML of water cor-
responds to a thickness of 0.3 nm. Therefore the total
water ice thickness is h = 60 nm. Right after N2 depo-
sition at 10 K, N2 should only cover the top few layers.
We denote this initial penetration depth as d. After suf-
ﬁcient diﬀusion, N2 penetrates into the ASW and evenly
covers the pore surfaces. We have the following equa-

distributed on the pores. The shifted dOH band area
is proportional to Cinf . At an intermediate stage t =
200 s, the shifted dOH band area is proportional to the
shaded area under C = 1 and C(z, t = 200). Figure 3
shows the ﬁtting of the curves in Figure 3.

Similar ﬁtting procedures were applied to O2, Ar,
CH4, and CO. The shifted dOH band area versus
isothermal experiment time at diﬀerent target temper-
atures is shown in Figures 7. After obtaining the D(T )
values from the ﬁtting, we use the Arrhenius expression
D(T ) = D0 exp(
Edif /T ) to ﬁnd the pre-exponential
factor D0 and diﬀusion energy barrier Edif . In a ln(D0)
vs 1/T plot, see Figure 8, data are ﬁtted very well with
the Arrhenius expression. The best ﬁtting diﬀusion en-
ergies and pre-exponents are summarized in Table 2.

We also attempted to measure the diﬀusion energy
barrier of H2 and D2 on ASW. However, the diﬀu-
sion rate of these two molecules are very high even at
4.8 K. They penetrate into the pores during the depo-
sition stage. We could not establish the exact diﬀusion
rate of them by isothermal experiment. Here we try
to estimate the upper limit of their diﬀusion barriers.
Figure 8 and Table 2 show that the values of prefac-
tor D0 are surprisingly similar for the molecules that
are measured. We assume that the D0 values for D2
and H2 are both 10−7 cm2s−1). The diﬀusion of them
is so fast that we could not see any time lag in shift-
ing of dOH. Therefore the diﬀusion coeﬃcient should be
at least comparable with the higher values of D shown
in Figure 8. We take the value ln(D) >
41. Using
T ln(D/D0), we can estimate that
the formula Edif =

Edif < 120 K for both H2 and D2. These upper limits of
H2 and D2 should be useful in astrochemical modeling.

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The pre-exponential factor and energy barrier of dif-
fusion coeﬃcient are key parameters in simulations of
chemical evolution of ISM environments. Because of
the well-known diﬃculty, very few laboratory measure-
ments of them are available in the literature. The values
that are appropriate for tracer diﬀusion are even more
scarce. Astrochemical models usually assume that the
pre-exponent ν of the diﬀusion rate Γ is the same as
that for desorption, and that the Edif /Edes ratio is the
same for all volatiles. This ratio is often taken to be
between 0.3 and 0.5. In Table 3 we listed the diﬀusion
energy barriers obtained from this study and desorption
energies obtained previously by our group (He et al.
2016), except for Ar. Following the same procedure as
in He et al. (2016), we did a set of Ar temperature pro-
grammed desorption (TPD) experiments on non-porous
ASW to obtain the desorption energy distribution of Ar.
The TPD spectra and resulting desorption energy dis-
tribution are shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, respec-
tively. At relative high Ar coverages, there is a second
desorption peak between 40 and 45 K. This component
is perhaps due to the desorption from sample holder. In
ﬁtting the binding energy distribution using a empiri-
cal formula, we intentionally placed a higher weight for
the TPD curves corresponding to lower coverages. We
found that the desorption energy distribution can be ﬁt
by the formula:

Eb(θ) = 930+800 exp

(cid:18)−

max(0.2

1.5
lg(θ), 0.001) (cid:19)

−

(9)

where θ is the coverage.

The binding energy for all of the volatile molecules
covers a wide range. At low coverages, molecules prefer-
ably occupies deep adsorption sites, and the binding
energy is high. As coverage increases, deeper sites

are no longer available, and molecules occupy shal-
lower sites. At 1 ML and above, the binding en-
ergy is the lowest. The lower value of binding en-
ergy in Table 3 corresponds to the value for 1 ML,
and the higher values corresponds to very low cover-
ages. The Edif /Edes ratios are also shown in the ta-
ble. The ratio is mostly between 0.3 and 0.6, which
agrees with prior oﬀ-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo simula-
tions by Karssemeijer & Cuppen (2014) and the range
that has been assumed — based solely on empirical es-
timates — in models of the chemical evolution of ISM
environments (Garrod & Pauly 2011). In our previous
work He et al. (2017), we measured the diﬀusion of CO2
on non-porous ASW and found that the diﬀusion en-
ergy barrier is about 0.95 times the binding energy. It
still remains a question why CO2 is very diﬀerent from
the more volatile molecules. One possibility is that in
He et al. (2017) the diﬀusion pre-exponent factor ν in
the diﬀusion rate was assumed to be the same as the vi-
bration frequency ν0 of a single particle in the potential
well of the surface, which is probably not true, since it
ignores entropic eﬀects and interaction with other par-
ticles (Ehrlich 1994). The pre-exponent D0 of the dif-
fusion coeﬃcient in Table 2 can be used to obtain the
frequency factor using the Einstein relation for diﬀusion
in two dimension (Tsong 2005):

D0 = νa

2

/4

(10)

where a = 0.3 nm is the distance between two near-
est adsorption sites on ASW assumed in our analysis.
This is the expression pertinent to tracer diﬀusion. The
resulting frequency ν can be used in astrochemical mod-
eling to describe the diﬀusion of molecules on the sur-
face of ASW. The values of ν are mostly in the range of
108 to 109 s−1. This is orders of magnitude lower than
the typical value of the single particle vibrational fre-
quency ν0(1012 to 1013 s−1) that is assumed in models.
If we assume that the pre-exponent ν for CO2 is 108 s−1
instead of 1012 s−1, the Edif /Edes ratio would be low-
ered to the 0.6–0.7 range, closer to the ratio for more
volatile molecules. Further laboratory study are neces-
sary to quantify the diﬀusion parameters of less volatile
molecules.

In conclusion, we presented the ﬁrst comprehensive
set of diﬀusion parameters (pre-exponent D0 and acti-
vation energy Edif in the Arrhenius expression for the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient) for simple molecules diﬀusing on
the pore surface of ASW. Such parameters can be read-
ily applied in the simulation of the evolution of ices in
ISM environments.
