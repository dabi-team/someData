The absolute generalized cross sections and angular distribution parameters of photoelectrons for
the two-photon above threshold 3p-ionization of Ar were calculated in the exciting photon energy
range from 15.76 to 36 eV. The correlation function technique developed earlier was extended for
the case when an intermediate-state function is of a continuum-type.

We show that two-photon ionization of Ar near the 3p4 threshold to a large extent is determined
by the (3p 99K εd)2 two-photon absorption via the giant resonance. This many-electron correlation
causes (i) an increase of the photoionization cross sections by more than a factor of 3; (ii) the
appearance of resonances in the exciting-photon energy range of the doubly-excited states. The
predictions are supported by a good agreement between length and velocity results obtained after
taking into account of the higher-order perturbation theory corrections.

INTRODUCTION

Advancements in new intense and tunable free-electron
lasers (FELs) [1–5] covering the ultra-violet and X-ray
photon-energy ranges inspire a renewed interest for a de-
tailed comprehension of multi-photon processes. Experi-
mental data obtained using FELs are of great motivation
for theory to provide not only qualitative but also quan-
titative description of new phenomena.

One of these cases is atomic two-photon above-
threshold ionization (ATI) when the energy of a single
photon is suﬃcient to ionize an atom. It has been shown
[6–11] that below the one-photon ionization threshold
many-electron correlations signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the cal-
culated cross sections and angular distribution param-
eters of photoelectrons with respect to those obtained
in single-electron approximation. The intermediate-state
shake-up correlation studied in [9–11] resulted in a no-
ticeably closer agreement of the generalized two-photon
ionization cross section (G2PICS) calculated in length
(G2PICS-L) and velocity (G2PICS-V ) forms of the elec-
tric dipole operator. The ﬁnal-state electron scattering
correlations taken into account in [7, 8, 10, 11] decrease
noticeably the absolute values of G2PICS. In contrast,
the polarization of the atomic core by the photoelectron
[10, 11] increases the cross sections by 15-20%.

To the best of our knowledge, there is only one ab ini-
tio theoretical description of the two-photon ATI of Ar
[12]. Those calculations were carried out using Herman-
Skillman [13] potential for computing atomic orbitals
(AOs) without considering the collective behaviour of
electrons.

In this work we intend to take into account many-
electron correlations in the calculation of the 3p-ATI of

Ar. To solve this problem, the correlation function (CF)
technique developed by us in [10, 11] for the exciting-
photon energy region below the one-photon ionization
threshold is applied. We extent the CF technique for the
ATI case solving two challenging problems: (i) comput-
ing the CFs for positive energy, i.e., in the continuum,
satisfying the correct boundary conditions; (ii) comput-
ing the free-free dipole transition matrix elements con-
taining the CF and ﬁnal-state wave function, both of
continuum-type.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II we de-
scribe the correlation function method for a two-photon
transition amplitude calculation in the above-threshold
exciting-photon energy region. The technique of the
matrix element calculation for the two continuum-state
functions is also described in detail.
In section III the
developed method is applied to the calculation of par-
tial and total G2PICS of the 3p shell of Ar above the 3p
threshold. Various correlation eﬀects are considered and
discussed. The inﬂuence of many-electron correlations
on the angular-distribution parameters of the photoelec-
trons is studied in section IV. We conclude with a brief
summary in section V.

II. TWO-PHOTON TRANSITION
AMPLITUDES FOR THE ABOVE-THRESHOLD
PHOTON ENERGIES

In order to investigate the inﬂuence of many-electron
correlations on the ATI of atoms we considered the two-
photon 3p-ionization of argon applying the LS -coupling
scheme:

 
 
 
 
 
 
Ar 3p6(1S) + 2γ

→

Ar 3p5(2P )εℓ(1L)

(L = 0; 2). (1)

Here L and ℓ are the orbital angular momenta of the
ﬁnal state and photoelectron, respectively. We investi-
gate the case when the energy of a single photon is suﬃ-
cient to ionize the atom. This process is known as above-
threshold ionization (ATI).

bation theory (LOPT) in the ATI energy region is given

is a inﬁnitesimal positive quantity, and the sum contains
all possible intermediate states m including continuum
ones. The contributions accounting for many-electron
correlations were taken into account in addition to the
LOPT amplitude (2). We study all possible correlations
which are allowed in the next order of perturbation the-
ory due to Coulomb interaction of electrons. These tran-
sitions can schematically be presented as shown below.

the inhomogeneous equation (4) is solved disregarding

In Eq.(13) both the CF, φℓ′ (r), and the ﬁnal-state

the dipole integral (13) between the two continuum wave
functions, a special technique was applied. We used the
method described in [16, 17]. According to this method,
the dipole integral (13) is expressed as

C. Additional computational remarks

The wave functions of the atomic core of Ar were com-
puted on the ground-state conﬁguration 1s22s22p63s23p6
obtained in the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation. The
ﬁnal-state wave functions were obtained by solving the
HF equations for a photoelectron in the conﬁgurations
3p5εp(1S), 3p5εp(1D) and 3p5εf (1D) using frozen core
functions. The same frozen core functions were used in
the hℓ′ operator in Eq. (4).

The Hartree-Fock operator entering Eq. (4) includes
the non-local exchange part of the Coulomb interaction of
the CF with core electrons. In the same way as in [10], a
separate local diﬀerential equation is determined for each
term of the exchange Coulomb potential. As a result,
the single non-local integro-diﬀerential equation (4), is
transformed to a system of local diﬀerential equations.

4

In order to solve this system a non-iterative numerical
procedure is applied which is stable and converges at each
energy.

The calculation of the transition amplitude (Ib) via the
3s shell is identical for above (ATI) and below threshold
ionization. The latter case has been described in our pre-
vious work [10]. The correlation transition amplitudes
(II)-(V) were calculated using the CF technique. The
respective inhomogeneous equations were presented and
discussed in [10]. In the ATI energy region, the calcula-
tions of the CFs are diﬀerent in two cases. First, if the
energy denominator in the expression for the transition
amplitude has no pole, then the corresponding CF is of
discrete-type, consists of a real part only, and is calcu-
lated using technique [10]. Second, in the case the energy
denominator has a pole, then the CF is of continuum-
type, consists of real and imaginary parts, and is com-
puted using the method described above.

III. GENERALIZED TWO-PHOTON
IONIZATION CROSS SECTION FOR
ABOVE-THRESHOLD IONIZATION OF THE 3P
SHELL OF AR

In order to characterize two-photon ionization quan-
titatively, we use the generalized two-photon ionization
cross section (G2PICS) as deﬁned in [7, 9, 10]. This in-
trinsic quantity does not contain the exciting-photon ﬂux
and is therefore ideally suited to characterize this process.
The expression for the G2PICS is:

σq(ω) =

σq(L, ℓ, ω),

(28)

where q = 0 and q =
1 correspond to a linearly or cir-
cularly polarized incoming radiation, respectively. Each
partial generalized cross section is determined in cm4 s

A. LOPT approximation

The G2PICS of the 3p shell of Ar calculated in LOPT
approximation (processes (Ia) and (Ib)) are presented in

Fig. 1 in the exciting-photon energy region below the one-
photon ionization threshold (our calculation from [10])

in the LOPT approach is also depicted.

− |

ε3p|

The total G2PICS have been plotted in [12] vs the
+ω of the electron in the intermediate
energy ε1 =
state.
In our calculation the G2PICS is presented as
functions of the exciting-photon energy ω. To compare
our data with the data of [12] we used the experimental
one-photon ionization potential of the 3p-electron E(i)
3p =
1.158 Ry (corresponding to the energy level E(2P3/2) =
15.7596 eV [20]) instead of the Herman-Skillman value
= 1.065 Ry used in [12]. This aligns the one-photon
ε3p|
|
ionization thresholds in both calculations (see hatched
line at 15.76 eV in Fig. 1).

The G2PICS obtained in [12] agree fairly well with our
calculation close to the two-photon ionization threshold
(ω = 7.8798 eV). The data of [12] is located between our
G2PICS-L and G2PICS-V and diﬀers from our G2PICS-
L by 15%. The deviation is larger in the ATI region, as
seen from Fig. 1. At the one-photon 3p5 threshold, the
cross section from [12] exceeds our G2PICS-L by more
than three times, whereas at high photon energies it de-
creases more rapidly than our G2PICS, after ω = 30 eV
it is close to the present G2PICS-V . We suggest that
this disagreement arises most likely from the diﬀerent ap-
proximations in the CFs calculation: Herman-Skillman
in [12] vs term-dependent Hartree-Fock 3p5φℓ′ (1P) in the
present work.

In order to support this suggestion we performed a
separate study by calculating the G2PICS in the LOPT
approach using the average self-consistent 3p5ε′ℓ′ con-
ﬁguration instead of the term-dependent frozen core
3p5ε′ℓ′(1P ) conﬁguration. In this case the present cross
sections became closer to those obtained in [12].

The value of amplitude (Ib) for the transition via the
3s shell is less than 0.1% of the amplitude (Ia) and has
practically no inﬂuence on the calculated cross section.

The results depicted in Fig. 1 show that the G2PICS
calculated in our work in LOPT approximation in the
length and velocity forms diﬀer from each other by ap-
proximately two times. This diﬀerence indicates the ne-
cessity to include many-electron correlation in the calcu-
lation.

B. Correlation processes of third order of
perturbation theory

The total two-photon ionization cross section of the 3p
shell of Ar is a sum of three partial cross sections for the
transitions to the εp(1S), εp(1D) and εf (1D) channels.
As in [12], the εf (1D) channel is found to dominate in the
ATI region: in LOPT approximation at the one-photon
3p5 threshold the partial εf (1D) cross sections are about
85% and 89% of the total 3p cross sections in the length
and velocity gauge, respectively. Therefore, the inﬂuence

in detail for the case of the εf (1D) channel only.

In Fig. 2, the partial G2PICS for the εf (1D) channel
calculated in LOPT are compared with the cross section
computed with accounting for the processes (I)–(V) (cor-
relation (VI) is excluded). The starting value of the pho-
ton energy corresponds to the one-photon 3p5-ionization
threshold ω = 15.7596 eV. In Fig. 2, it is seen that the
correlative transitions (II)-(V) change the G2PICS only
quantitatively but without any qualitative change in their
energy dependence.

It turned out that in 3p-ATI correlation correction (VI)
is much more important than below the one-photon 3p
threshold. In ATI, the transition amplitude (VI) is sub-
stantially (one order of magnitude) larger than the other
correlation amplitudes (II)–(V) and changes the com-
puted cross sections drastically. In the processes (VIa)
and (VIb), the ﬁrst and the second photon excite a pair
of 3p core electrons to virtual ε′ℓ′ and ε′′ℓ′′ states; then
because of the Coulomb interaction, one electron returns
to the core and another changes the state to the εℓ ﬁnal
one. The large value of this correlation can be explained
through the existence of the giant resonance in each of
3p
the single-electron

transition amplitudes.

The electron-scattering correlation (VI) is found to be
very important in the ATI region. Therefore, we calcu-
lated it without the approximation discussed above using
the exact expression (30). This was possible in this spe-
cial case because in Eq. (30) both the Slater integrals
Rk(εℓ3p, ε′′ℓ′′ε′ℓ′) and the dipole integrals

are not divergent due to the presence

In Fig. 3, partial GSPICS for the transition to the
3p5εf (1D) channel calculated considering the correla-
tions (II)-(V) only and with all correlations (II)-(VI)
are compared. A drastic diﬀerence between the two re-
sults is evident: (i) the G2PICS in length form is en-
hanced by an order of magnitude resulting in a pro-
nounced maximum at ω = 32 eV; (ii) the correlation
(VI) gives rise to doubly-excited state resonances below
the two-photon 3p4 double-ionization threshold. The res-
onances become apparent at those photon energies when
the denominators in Eq. (30) containing 2ω are vanish-
ing. The ﬁrst, energetically lowest 3p43d4s resonance in
the partial 3p5εf (1D) G2PICS is shown in Fig. 3. We
restricted our presentation to this resonance because the
precise calculation of the doubly-excited state energies
is a cumbersome problem on its own (see, e.g., [21–23]).
The energies of the respective doubly-excited state res-
onances are expected to be larger than they appear in
the relaxed 3p4n′ℓ′n′′ℓ′′ conﬁguration. The two-photon
double-ionization threshold equals to 0.5E(i)
3p2 is depicted
in Fig. 3 by the hatched line. It indicates the upper limit
of the doubly-excited state resonances.

The revealed strong inﬂuence of many electron cor-
relations on G2PICS including the resonance structure
is beyond a simple single-electron picture of two-photon
ionization and its experimental veriﬁcation is of great
fundamental importance.

where r< and r> is the smaller and the larger of the

Since the ﬁrst factor in the denominator of the two
terms in the curly braces of Eq. (30) contains both the
ε′ and ε′′ intermediate state energies, the amplitude (30)
cannot be expressed via CFs.
In [10], we followed the
approximation of [9]. In the ﬁrst factor of the ﬁrst frac-
tion in curly braces containing 2ω, we replaced ε′ by ε′′
whereas in the second fraction in curly braces, we re-
placed ε′′ by ε′. After this assumption, Eq. (30) was
simpliﬁed and expressed via the correlation functions.
We estimated that at the near-threshold two-photon 3p-
ionization region the error of the approximated amplitude
did not exceed 7% with respect to the data obtained us-
ing the exact expression (30).

G2PICS calculated in length and velocity gauges con-
sidering all the transitions (I)-(VI) still diﬀer substan-
tially, as it is seen from Fig. 3. At ω = 32 eV the G2PICS-
L (dashed-dotted line) is four times larger than G2PICS-
V (dash-double-dotted line).
In our work, [10] a good
agreement between computed G2PICS-L and G2PICS-
V was achieved after inclusions of higher-order PT cor-
relations. Those eﬀects were: (i) the polarization of the
atomic core by the photoelectron and (ii) the correla-
tional decrease of the Coulomb interaction in the descrip-
tion of the correlative processes (II)-(VI). Additional cal-
culations showed that in ATI region taking into account
these higher-order PT correlations (i)-(ii) is not suﬃcient
to make an agreement between G2PICS-L and G2PICS-
V close. The reason is the anomalously large contribution

The ab initio core polarization potential V CP (r) [25]
was included in the HF operator hℓ′(r) entering the equa-
tions for the CFs and for the ﬁnal-state electrons. In ad-
dition, the matrix elements of the Coulomb interaction
describing the correlations (II)-(VI) have been reduced
by a factor of 1.25 [10]. Here and below, the calculation
with taking into account the processes (I)-(VI), intrashell
correlations, polarization of the atomic core by the pho-
toelectron and the correlational decrease of the Coulomb
interaction will be designated as the conﬁguration inter-
action Hartree-Fock approach with core polarization (CI-
HFCP).

The CIHFCP partial cross sections for the εf (1D)
channel are depicted in Fig. 4 (solid and dashed curves for
length and velocity form, respectively). In the same ﬁg-
ure the cross sections calculated with taking into account
processes (I)-(VI) but without higher-order PT correc-
tions are also presented (dash-dotted and dash-double-
dotted curves) for comparison. It is clearly seen that ac-
counting for higher-order PT corrections results in a very
close agreement between the G2PICS-L and G2PICS-V
both above the two-photon double-ionization threshold
(to the right of the hatched line in Fig. 4) and in the
region of the 3p44s3d resonance. The following changes
in the calculated G2PICS can be seen from Fig. 4:

(i) the energy of the 3p44s3d resonance shifted by 0.15
eV to the low-energy side. The reason of the shift is
the polarization of the atomic core by the photoelectron

which decreases energies of the excited electrons;

(ii) the G2PICS becomes larger on the one-photon

threshold (ω = 15.76 eV) by about 2 times;

7

(iii) maximum in the σ(ω) dependence above the two-
6 eV to the

photon 3p4 threshold is now shifted by
low-energy side.

channel, computed in length (L) and velocity (V ) form for
linearly polarized incoming radiation with accounting for all
the correlations (I)-(VI) (corr) and, in addition, the higher-
order PT correlations (CIHFCP). The two-photon 3p4(3P2)
ionization threshold is indicated by the hatched line. The ﬁrst
calculated 3p44s3d doubly-excited state resonance is shown
only.

The computed partial G2PICSs for the transitions to
the 3p5εp(1D) and 3p5εp(1S) channels are depicted in
Figs. 5a and 5b, respectively. Dash-dotted and dash-
double-dotted lines represent results computed in the
LOPT and solid and dashed lines represent CIHFCP re-
sults. Similar to the 3p5εf (1D) channel, one can recog-
nize a strong increase the G2PICSs, the appearance of
the doubly-excited state resonances and a better agree-
ment between length an velocity form results.

In the insets of Figs. 5a,b the doubly-excited state res-
onance region of the G2PICS-L is presented on an en-
larged scale. For the 3p5εf (1D) channel, the lowest res-
onance corresponds to the 3p44s3d state (see Figs.3 and
4), whereas in the 3p5εp(1D) and 3p5εp(1S) channels the
3p44s2 and 3p44s5s states are also present. As it was al-
ready mentioned, precise calculation of the resonance en-
ergies is a separate cumbersome problem. In more detail,

corresponds to the position of the 3p44s2 resonance in
Fig. 5. The experimental energy of the 3p44s2 resonance

is at ω = 13.475 eV [26]. The main reason for this dis-
crepancy is the approximate (frozen-core) value of ε4s.

In [9–11], a large inﬂuence of the intermediate-state
shake-up (IV) correlation on the computed G2PICS was
revealed, particularly on the 3p5εp(1S) partial cross sec-
tion. In the ATI case, this inﬂuence is of similar size, as
demonstrated in Fig. 6. Correlation (IV) inﬂuences both
the real and the imaginary part of the transition ampli-
tude and pulls together the 3p G2PICS computed in the
length and velocity gauges.

Concluding this section we demonstrate the eﬀect of a
successive inclusion of diﬀerent correlations in the cal-
culated total 3p shell G2PICS in Fig. 7.
In Fig. 7a,
we compare the G2PICS computed in LOPT approx-
imation with the cross sections obtained with taking
into account correlations (II-VI). The drastic change of
σ(ω) is obvious: a resonance structure appears below the
two-photon 3p4 threshold and a considerable enhance-
ment of the above-threshold cross section together with
a change of the shape of σ(ω) from monotonic decrease to
curve with a broad maximum occurs. Those changes are
mainly due to the electron-scattering correlation (VI), i.e

two-photon G2PICS in Ar or Xe close to their respective
3p4 and 4d8 thresholds would be highly desirable.

In Fig. 7b, the inﬂuence of the polarization of the
atomic core by the photoelectron on the computed to-
tal cross section is presented. It results in a shift of the
maximum of σ(ω) to lower photon energies and makes the
humped curve more vivid. At the two-photon 3p4(3P2)
threshold the G2PICS increases by

33%.

In Fig. 7c, the inﬂuence of the intrashell correlation on
the dominating process (VI) and the eﬀect of the corre-
lational decrease of the Coulomb interaction on the tran-
sitions (II)-(VI) is shown. These higher-order PT cor-
rections bring the cross sections computed in length and
velocity form in the considered photon-energy regions to-
gether.

the agreement between length and velocity results.

The comparison between β(ω) computed in the LOPT
approximation and with taking into account all the con-
sidered correlations exhibits a considerable change in
β(ω) dependencies in the range where the doubly-excited
resonances are situated. The inﬂuence of many-electron
correlations on β(ω) at ω & 22 eV is less pronounced
than in the G2PICS case. To a large extent this fact is
connected with the prevalence of the 3p5εf channel in the
two-photon photoionization of Ar due to the inﬂuence of
the 3p 99K εd giant resonance.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In the present work, the two-photon ionization of the
3p shell of Ar in the above-threshold ionization (ATI)
region was studied theoretically. For this purpose, we
extended a noniterative correlation function (CF) tech-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nique developed earlier [10] to the case when both the CF
and the ﬁnal-state function are of continuum-type. An
adequate accuracy of present calculations supported by
good agreement between the results obtained in length
and velocity form of dipole transition operator.

The many-electron correlation which can be treated as
the (3p 99K εd)2 absorption of the two exciting photons
at giant resonance play a decisive role in two-photon ion-
ization of Ar near the 3p4 threshold. Taking into account
this correlation results in (i) an increase of the computed
G2PICS by approximately three times and (ii) the ap-
pearance of resonance proﬁles in the energy range of the
doubly-excited 3p4n′ℓ′n′′ℓ′′ states (15.76 < ω < 21.69
eV).

Taking into account all remaining single and double
electron excitations in computing the transition ampli-
tudes results in better agreement between G2PICS-L and
G2PICS-V . Nevertheless, a 3 time diﬀerence between
them in some partial photoionization channels still re-
mains. This diﬀerence was removed after taking into
account higher-order PT corrections. These corrections
were included by: (i) the polarization of the atomic core
by the photoelectron, realized by incorporation of an ab
initio polarization potential in the Hamiltonian; (ii) the
eﬀective correlational decrease of the Coulomb interac-
tion, taken into account by computing respective reduc-
tion coeﬃcients; (iii) the intrashell correlations, taken
into account via a technique described in [24]. Good

10

agreement between length and velocity results for angular
distribution parameters was also obtained after inclusion
of the described above many-electron correlations.

Finally, our ab initio computation clariﬁed that the
two-photon above-threshold 3p ionization of Ar near the
3p4 threshold is almost entirely a collective-electron pro-
cess. An experiment to benchmark the present calcula-
tion is desirable.
