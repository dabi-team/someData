1. Introduction

The milestone discoveries of integer quantum Hall ef-
fect (QHE) and fractional QHE made the QHE one of the
most important Ô¨Åelds in modern condensed mater physics.
The dissipationless chiral edge states of the QHE regime
can be used in low power consumption, high speed elec-
tronic devices. The unique chiral edge states responsible for
the QHE originate from the magnetically induced Landau
levels[1]. However, well-deÔ¨Åned Landau levels are only pos-
sible in high-mobility samples under strong external mag-
netic Ô¨Åelds. The demanding requirements prevent the QHE
from being widely applied in industry. Therefore, it is highly
desirable to achieve the QHE without the need of a strong
magnetic Ô¨Åeld and an extraordinarily high mobility sample.
The anomalous Hall eÔ¨Äect (AHE) in a ferromagnet can be
induced by spontaneous magnetization without needing an
external magnetic Ô¨Åeld [2]. Then, a quantized version of the

AHE, the quantum anomalous Hall eÔ¨Äect (QAHE), repre-
senting the realization of the QHE in the zero magnetic Ô¨Åeld
has come to the forefront [2, 3].When QAHE is realized, one
) of ùëí2/h and a
can observe a plateau of Hall conductance (ùúåùë•ùë¶
) even at zero mag-
vanishing longitudinal conductance (ùúåùë•ùë•
netic Ô¨Åeld (Fig.1)[4]. Then, the realization of the QAHE may
lead to the development of low-power-consumption electron-
ics. There are two prerequisites for the observation of the
QAHE : the formation of an exchange gap induced by the
coupling with the magnetization in or next to the topological
insulator (TI) and the precise tuning of E
into the gap[5].
ùêπ
In detail, to realize QAHE requires four conditions: (1) the
system must be 2D; (2) insulating bulk; (3) ferromagnetic or-
dering; and (4) a non-zero Chern number[6]. Then topolog-
ical materials holding magnetism can satisfy the conditions
[7‚Äì9]. Until now, QAHE state has only been realized in mag-
netically doped Cr- and/or V-doped (Bi,Sb)
topological
2
insulator Ô¨Ålms system, below ‚àº 1K [4, 10]. However, such a
low critical temperature severely constrains both the explo-
ration of fundamental physics and technological applications
based on this exotic phenomenon[11]. Therefore, seeking
new materials to realize QAHE at higher temperature has

become a major research direction in the Ô¨Åeld of topological
quantum materials. One approach is to try to dop the other
3d elements such Mn, Fe and Co into the TI. The opening
of the gap has been realized in Fe or Mn-doped Bi
[12,
2
13]. For Co doped TI, ferromagnetic behaviour and antifer-
romagnetic behaviour have been observed in Bi

[16], respectively. Another ap-

[14, 15] and Sb

proach is to use the magnetic proximity eÔ¨Äects (MPEs) to
induce magnetic order in a TI by coupling it to an adjacent
magnetically ordered material. Lots of excellent works have
been done such as the reports on EuS/TI [17‚Äì19], Y

[20‚Äì22], CrSb/TI[23],Tm

Another promising approach is to realize high-temperature
QAHE insulator in thin Ô¨Ålms of intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM)
or antiferromagnetic (AFM) TI materials [26]. Neverthe-
less, despite much theoretical and experimental eÔ¨Äorts de-
voted, there is little progress until the recent discovery of
an intrinsic AFM TI MnBi
[27‚Äì32]. The growth of
Te
MnBi
was Ô¨Årst reported by Lee et al. and it was treated
as a kind of thermoelectric material at that time[33]. Then,
lots of theoretical and experimental work were done to treat
MnBi
insulator[27‚Äì32]. On experiment, MnBi
could be syn-
thesized through several approaches, but it is not so easy
to get the high purity crystalline samples with perfect anti-
ferromagnetic order[32, 34]. Then to understand its growth
mechanism become an urgent necessity.In another aspect, it

but the other materials of this family with dynamically sta-

Then,understanding the growth mechanism can help researcher
to get the single crystals of the other family members too.
Recently, Li et al. has reported the growth of high quality
MnBi
with perfect antiferromagnetic order[32]. Based

tamination and oxidation layer, then to observe the intrinsic
chemical states of ùõº-MnTe and MnBi

bulk single crystal MnBi

the ion energy is 1000eV.The analysis software CasaXPS is
used to Ô¨Åt the peaks. The magnetization measurements were
performed in a Quantum Design superconducting quantum

It may follow such key points: I) The inserting layers (MnTe

to P6
/mmc (194) space group, which is stable in bulk form.
Te
As shown by Fig.2 that, both unit cells of ùõº-MnTe and Bi
3
2
have layered structure, with the trigonal layer and hexagonal
layer alternately stacking along the c axis, which makes the
insertion of -Mn-Te- possible. However, it is predicted that
(ùëÖÃÑ3ùëö(166) space group) is also a
rhombohedral MnBi
2
kind of antiferromagnetic topological insulator[35].We have
tried several times to get the bulk rhombohedral structure
MnBi
by the similar inserting method, but it is not suc-
cessful. What we have done is that, we use ùõº-MnSe of NaCl
structure (ùêπ ùëöÃÑ3ùëö space group of cubic system and the sta-
ble phase of manganese selenium compounds) as the insert-
ing layer material to try to insert it into the rhombohedral
. Then it can be explained from the symmetry per-
Bi
spective: inserting ùõº-MnSe with NaCl structure into rhom-
bohedral (trigonal phase) Bi
, just like inserting a square
Se
3
into a stack of triangle (or regular hexagon), which is not
permitted by the symmetry and not stable too.We think the
symmetry is the major obstacle to hinder the formation of
rhombohedral MnBi
which is a potential antiferromag-
netic topological insulator. II) Lattice mismatch between ùõº-
MnTe and Bi
is acceptable. According to the powder
2
XRD pattern shown by Fig.3, we have reÔ¨Åned lattice pa-
rameters of ùõº-MnTe which are a=4.1477 √Ö, c=6.7123 √Ö,
while for that of Bi
are a=4.384 √Ö, c=30.488 √Ö, respec-
tively. As the lattice parameters mainly inÔ¨Çuencing the in-
serting process is from a axis, the lattice mismatch between
ùõº-MnTe and Bi
in a axis is calculated, which is only
2
3.4% ( ùëé‚àíùëé0
√ó 100%). III) Self-stability of ùõº-MnTe. The bulk
ùëé
ùõº-phase of MnTe is stable at room temperature and atmo-
spheric pressure. IV) There exists charges transfer between
the inserting layers (MnTe) and the inserted layers (Bi
).
2
As shown by Fig.2 (c), (d) and (e) that, during the inserting
growth process bilayer -Mn-Te- of ùõº-MnTe would insert into
the gap between the third layer (Te atoms layer) and fourth

Therefore, Mn atoms of ùõº-MnTe would bond with Te atoms
, then Mn atoms would transfer electrons to Te; Te
of Bi
2
atoms of ùõº-MnTe would bond with Bi atoms of Bi
, then
2
Bi atoms would transfer electrons to Te. The charges trans-
fer can make the MnBi
system stable. In summary, the

It could be observed that MnBi

which means the c axis is the easy axis. A modiÔ¨Åed Curie-

ized Mn moments. The Ô¨Åtted eÔ¨Äective paramagnetic mo-
ment with the value of 5.0ùúáùêµ

ther, Ô¨Åeld dependence of magnetization of MnBi

the magnetic Ô¨Åeld of H//c and H‚üÇc. Its temperature depen-
dence of magnetic susceptibility has been measured under

netic transition tends to become weaker and Ô¨Ånally disap-
pears with the increase of the applied out-of-plane magnetic
Ô¨Åeld, due to the suppression and spin-Ô¨Çop of interlayer anti-
ferromagnetic coupling caused by the external out-of-plane
magnetic Ô¨Åeld[30, 32]. The magnetic measurement result
shows that the MnBi
single crystal owns good crystal
quality and well antiferromagnetic property. As shown by
Fig.5, complementary to the magnetic measurements, the
temperature dependence of the in-plane electrical resistance
R(T) of a bulk MnBi
single crystal was measured from
room temperature down to T = 2.0 K. The resistance de-
creases with lowering the temperature, which is the metallic
behaviour. The R-T curve exhibits a distinct peaklike fea-
ture centered at 24.0 K. The local increase indicates an en-
hanced electron scattering in the vicinity of a magnetic phase
transition, and a sharp decrease below the peak signals the

compared to the initial spectrum (above line), the spectrum
obtained from the cleaned surface (below line) does not show
surface contaminants, i.e. oxygen and carbon anymore. Fig.

Mn2p spectrum of Fig. 7(a) reveals two main contributions:

the overlap of the binding energy of MnO and MnTe[50],
Peak 1 of Fig.7 (a) may be a sum of two partial contribu-
tions: MnO and MnTe. However, it is diÔ¨Écult to separate
Peak 1 into two reasonable parts. Peak 3 shifting to higher
energies can be ascribed to the satellite of Peak 1[50‚Äì54].
The satellites are also called shakeup satellites. It locates at
the higher-binding-energy side of the relevant core-lines of
transition metal (TM) or rare earth (RE) ions in the selected
TM or RE compounds [55]. It also concerns on particular
binary Mn oxides, especially MnO [54]. Such satellite struc-
ture in Mn 2p XPS spectrum originates from charge trans-
fer between outer electron shell of ligand and an unÔ¨Ålled 3d
shell of Mn during creation of core-hole in the photoelec-
tron process [52‚Äì54]. For Fig.7 (c), Peak 1 at the position of
639.8eV corresponds to +1 charge state of Mn, which may
come from nanoclusters of manganese subtelluride (possibly
Mn
Te) induced by ùê¥ùëü+ ion sputtering[50].The above eÔ¨Äect
2
is strictly analogous to the reduction of Mn oxides during
ùê¥ùëü+ ion bombardment[56]. Peak 3 with the binding energy
of 643.5 eV is supposed to be the satellite of Peak 1. Peak 2
at the position of 642.1eV belongs to Mn-O bonds of MnO
.
2
Peak 4 is the satellite of Peak 2. For (b) and (d) panels of
Fig.6, the removal of contaminants from the surface leads to
disappearance of the native oxides contributions to the Mn2p
spectrum, i.e. those of MnO
and MnO. Therefore, Peak 2 of
=641.1 eV, can be ascribed to the divalent
Fig. 7(d), with ùê∏ùêµ
. Peak 4 of Fig. 7(d) exhibiting a
Mn-Te bond of MnBi
2
= 5.3 eV (as
shift from Peak 2 with the value of ŒîE=ùê∏ùëù4
shown by Table I) is the satellite of Peak 2. Peak 1 with ùê∏ùêµ

= 639.8 eV may be induced by the ùê¥ùëü+ ion bombardment
during the surface preparation. It is the +1 charge state of
Mn and can be ascribed to the Mn‚ÄìTe bond in the nanoclus-
ters of manganese subtelluride (possibly Mn
Te), created in
2
the surface and subsurface region penetrated by ùê¥ùëü+ ions
[33]. Peaks 3 is the corresponding satellite of Peak 1. In ad-
dition, rising intensity of the Mn2p satellite for divalent Mn
(bound to chalcogen) with atomic number of ligand (from
MnO to MnBi
) could be observed too. As shown by Fig.
7 (e) and (f) that the peaks‚Äô positions of Te3d of ùõº-MnTe al-
, which means that the
most overlap with those of MnBi
chemical states of Te both from ùõº-MnTe and MnBi
are
the same. Fig. 7 (g) and (h) are the XPS spectra of Bi4f ac-
quired from the MnBi
surface without and with sputter-
2
ing, respectively. As shown by Fig.7(g) that peak 1 locating
at the position of 157.3eV corresponds to Bi-Te bond, while
peak 2 locating at the position of 158.8eV corresponds to
Bi-O bond of Bi
[57, 58]. As shown by Fig.7(h) that, af-
ter being sputtered, there exists only one kind of bond i. e.
Bi-Te bond with the binding energy of 157.4eV. This tells us
again that the contaminants have been removed completely
by the sputtering procedure. Comparison of the Ô¨Åtted Mn2p
and Te3d parameters of the MnBi
and ùõº-MnTe spec-
tral components gathered in Table I, it shows a very good
consistency between them (considering the accuracy of the
method, i.e. ŒîE = 0.1 eV). Then we can get the conclusion
that, Mn and Te of MnBi
share the same chemical state
Te
4
with those of ùõº-MnTe, which supports our hypothesis that
the growth mode of MnBi
is the inserting-layer growth
Te
mode.

Single crystals of antiferromagnetic topological insula-
have been grown by Ô¨Çux method. The mag-
tor MnBi
Te

netic property of MnBi
is investigated, which shows good
2
antiferromagnetic character with Neel temperature of 24.5K
and a spin-Ô¨Çop transition at H‚âà 35000 Oe, 1.8K. The possi-
ble inserting-layer growth mode of MnBi
is proposed,
which is supported by the XPS and XRD result of ùõº-MnTe
. The proposed crystal growth mechanism
and MnBi
may help us to grow the other members of MB
-family
materials, which have rich topological quantum states.
