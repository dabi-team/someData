Abstract: Photoacoustic (PA) imaging systems are spreading in the biomedical community, and the development of new PA contrast 
agents is an active area of research. However, PA contrast agents are usually characterized with spectrophotometry or uncalibrated 
PA imaging systems, leading to partial assessment of their PA efficiency. To enable quantitative PA spectroscopy of contrast agents 
in vitro with conventional PA imaging systems, we have developed an adapted calibration method. Contrast agents in solution are 
injected in a dedicated non-scattering tube phantom imaged at different optical wavelengths. The calibration method uses a reference 
solution of cupric sulfate to simultaneously correct for the spectral energy distribution of excitation light at the tube location and 
perform a conversion of the tube amplitude in the image from arbitrary to spectroscopic units. The method does not require any 
precise alignment and provides quantitative PA spectra, even with non-uniform illumination and ultrasound sensitivity. It was im-
plemented on a conventional imaging setup based on a tunable laser operating between 680 nm and 980 nm and a 5 MHz clinical 
ultrasound array. We demonstrated robust calibrated PA spectroscopy with sample volumes as low as 15 μL of known chromophores 
and commonly used contrast agents. The validated method will be an essential and accessible tool for the development of new and 
efficient PA contrast agents by improving their quantitative characterization.

1. Introduction 

Photoacoustic  imaging (PAI)  is  an  emerging multi-wave biomedical  imaging modality  able  to reveal molecular 
information at centimeter depths in biological tissues and with sub-millimeter resolutiaon [1]. PAI is based on the pho-
toacoustic (PA) effect: optically absorbing materials emit ultrasound waves when excited with transient illumination. 
The ultrasound waves are generated by thermoelastic expansion, and their amplitude is proportional to the absorbed 
optical energy at the excitation wavelength. Therefore, successive acquisitions of PA images at different optical wave-
lengths may allow spectral discrimination and quantification of the various absorbers in the imaged region [2]. 

To enhance this hybrid imaging modality beyond the information provided by endogenous absorbers such as he-
moglobin, the injection of absorbing exogenous contrast agents is often required [3]⁠. Recently, the material science com-
munity has shown a growing interest in the development of novel PA contrast agents [4,5], resulting in a strong need 
for techniques able to characterize them in terms of effective PA spectra and efficiency to generate ultrasound. Spectro-
photometry (SPP), based on the transmission of light by a sample, usually measures the optical attenuation: the sum of 
losses due to the absorption and the scattering of light. However, the latter does not contribute to PA signal generation. 
Moreover, SPP does not account for the photophysical and thermoelastic processes that occur during optical absorption 
and the subsequent ultrasound pressure generation.   

For many of the developed PA contrast agents, the in vivo detectability with PAI is demonstrated using commercial 
PAI systems or conventional prototypes. Therefore, PAI systems are available to many research groups and could be 
advantageously used to perform a more quantitative in vitro PA characterization of the agents than with SPP. Commer-
cial PAI systems [6,7] have already been proposed to measure the PA spectral response of contrast agents. However, no 
calibration was performed for such systems, leading to PA spectral assessments in arbitrary units. On the other hand, 
dedicated calibrated PA spectrometers have also been developed. However, they do not use a PAI system and therefore

require  a  specific  instrument.  Beard  et  al.  [8–11]  developed  a  PA  spectrometer  able  to  measure  the  absolute  optical 
absorption coefficient by fitting an analytic expression to the photoacoustically generated ultrasound signal. Further-
more, photoacoustic specific coefficients could be calculated with this system: the photothermal conversion efficiency 
Ept, which represents the conversion efficiency of the absorbed optical energy to heat, and the Grüneisen coefficient Γ 
(relative to water), which describes the conversion of the heat energy to the initial pressure rise resulting in the ultra-
sound waves. However, this PA spectrometer requires large sample volumes (mL) and a specific ultrasound detector 
with a very broadband and flat frequency response to correctly resolve the ultrasound waveform [10]. Other PA spec-
trometers based on dedicated single-element detectors place fewer constraints related to the ultrasound frequency re-
sponse of the detector. They evaluate the optical absorption coefficient using calibration with a known reference solu-
tion [12,13]⁠
⁠. For these PA spectrometers, small sample volumes (3 µL [13] and 200 µL [12]) are placed in optically trans-
parent cells, and SPP is performed on the same sample to concurrently measure the optical attenuation.   

We have developed and we present herein a calibration method using a reference solution to transform a conven-
tional multispectral PAI system into a calibrated PA spectrometer for the in vitro characterization of PA contrast agents. 
We implemented the method in a conventional configuration for PAI [14,15]⁠: a clinical linear ultrasound detector array 
with light delivered from the side. For PA contrast agent characterization, small sample volumes (15 µL) were injected 
in tubes whose diameter was chosen such that the ultrasound emission matches the frequency bandwidth of the detec-
tor. We demonstrate that our simple experimental setup enables robust calibrated spectroscopic measurements of pho-
toacoustic contrast agents. 

2. Materials and Methods 

2.1. Experimental Setup and Data Acquisition 

The  experimental  setup  is presented  in  Figure  1a.  It  is comprised of  a sample compartment and  a conventional 

multispectral PAI system.   

Figure 1. Experimental setup: (a) Annotated picture of the PAI system and schematic drawing of the experimental setup. The imaging 
plane of the array is perpendicular to the picture plane and perpendicular to the tubes. The laser beam was especially made visible 
for the picture with dust particles added in the water bath. (b) Experimental and theoretical frequency spectra of the PA-generated 
ultrasound signal. The experimental ultrasound spectrum was acquired with a tube filled with the calibration solution at 710 nm. 
The theoretical spectrum corresponds to Equation (A1). The spectra are normalized to their maximum values. (c) Image of 4 tubes 
filled with the calibration solution. 

2.1.1. Sample Compartment 

The sample compartment consists of 50 cm long polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubes (inner diameter: 0.2 mm, 
wall thickness: 0.1 mm, Bola, Germany). PTFE (Teflon) is hydrophobic and chemically inert; therefore, PTFE tubes are 
well adapted to contain aqueous solution of PA contrast agents. Moreover, PTFE was shown to have a weak optical 
absorption in the near infrared (NIR)  [16] to avoid strong background PA signals. The tubes were threaded through 
holes of two parallel perforated plates located 8 cm apart. The tubes were arranged to be parallel one to the other. Up 
to four tubes were positioned in the sample holder to perform simultaneous data acquisition (Figure 1c). The tubes were 
positioned  in  a  staggered  arrangement  instead  of  an  in-line  arrangement  to  avoid  both  optical  shadowing  and 

 
 
 
 
3  of  20 

interferences of the emitted ultrasound waves at the detector surface. To ensure a good spatio-temporal separation of 
the ultrasound signals from each tube and thereby independent measurements, a distance of at least 4 mm between the 
tubes was arbitrary chosen here. This distance may be reduced for a higher number of tubes. The tubes were immersed 
in a water tank (ultrapure water,  resistivity 18 MΩ·cm, Purelab Option Q, ELGA LabWater) at room temperature to 
ensure acoustic coupling between the samples and the ultrasound detector of the PAI system. The two ends of each 
tube were kept out of the water tank to inject and collect the measured samples, respectively. The inner volume of each 
tube was 15 µL, and the tubes were filled using a 33-gauge needle and a 50 µL gas-tight syringe (Hamilton). A ther-
mometer (HI98509, Hanna instruments, Lingolsheim, France) was used to monitor the temperature of the water bath 
with  a  precision  of  ±0.2  °C.  The  temperature  of  the  bath  had  a  maximum  variation  range  of  1  °C  for  each  series  of 
measurement. 

2.1.2. The Conventional PAI System 

A  tunable  (680–980  nm)  optical  parametric  oscillator  laser  (SpitLight  600  OPO,  Innolas  Laser  GmbH,  Krailling, 
Germany) delivering < 8 ns pulses with a pulse repetition frequency of 20 Hz was used to generate the optical excitation. 
The tuning range corresponds to the first optical window in biological tissue and to the near-infrared wavelength range 
typically used in PA tomography. Ultrasound was detected with a 128-element clinical linear array (L7-4, 5 MHz center 
frequency, bandwidth 4–7 MHz, ATL) driven by a programmable ultrasound machine used in receive-only mode (Van-
tage, Verasonics, WA, USA). A bifurcated fiber bundle (CeramOptec GmbH, Bonn, Germany) guided the light toward 
the fixed elevational focus of the ultrasound array (located at 25 mm from the surface of the detector) and delivered 
light over the entire length of the array. The tubes containing the samples were placed perpendicularly to the imaging 
plane of the ultrasound detector and near the elevational focus for higher sensitivity. Therefore, the intersection of the 
imaging plane with each tube was a disk. The illuminated length (perpendicular to the imaging plane) was around 1.5 
cm. Figure 1b shows that the ultrasound frequency bandwidth of the detector (4–7 MHz) is fully included in the main 
peak of the ultrasound spectrum generated by one tube (Appendix A). Then, the detection sensitivity is high for this 
sample container. 

The mean fluence at the elevational focus was estimated to be around 4 mJ.cm−2 at 730 nm (wavelength at which 
the laser has the maximum pulse energy). This estimation was performed in air by dividing the laser energy per pulse 
(Pyroelectric  Energy  sensor  ES245C,  Thorlabs,  Newton,  NJ,  USA)  by  the  area  covered  by  the  excitation  light  in  the 
elevational focal plane (at 25 mm of the detector surface). The fluence was lowered for some samples by reducing the 
laser energy before injection in the fiber bundle thanks to polarizing optics. Because of broken fibers, the finite length 
of the outputs of the fiber bundle, and the staggered arrangement of the tubes, the laser fluence was not uniform over 
the tubes. However, neither the precise knowledge of the laser fluence nor the uniformity of the illumination is required 
for our method since a calibration procedure is carried out per tube and for each series of PA spectrum measurements.   

2.1.3. Measurement Process 

For the PA acquisition, each laser pulse triggered (1) an ultrasound acquisition in parallel on all the 128 elements 
of the detector array and (2) a recording of the pulse energy using a pyrometer incorporated in the laser. The incorpo-
rated pyrometer was not calibrated, but it was verified, using an external calibrated pyroelectric energy meter (PE50BF-
DIFH-C, Ophir Photonics), that the delivered electric signal was proportional to the pulse energy for each laser pulse at 
a  given  wavelength.  For  a  spectroscopic  acquisition, measurements  were performed  successively  at different  optical 
wavelengths (λ) over the entire tunable spectral range of the laser and at an acquisition rate of 20 Hz. The per-pulse 
tunability of the laser was used, and the wavelength sequence was programmed with the laser software interface. The 
acquisition sequence consisted in recording the ultrasound signals and the corresponding pyrometer values for 15 suc-
cessive sweeps of 30 wavelengths between 680 nm and 970 nm with a step of 10 nm, for a total of 30 × 15 = 450 laser 
pulses. This swept sequence avoids consecutive excitations at a given wavelength that could induce photodegradation. 
Any potential changes in the PA spectra of the sample during the acquisition sequence can be detected as the entire 
spectral range is covered 15 times consecutively. For all samples reported in this paper, the spectra were found to be 
stable during the experimental sequences. Therefore, iterations at a given wavelength were averaged to increase the 
signal-to-noise ratio. Before averaging, ultrasound signal amplitudes were simply divided by the corresponding py-
rometer value to correct for the pulse-to-pulse energy fluctuations of the laser. 

For measurements with a spectrophotometer (SPP), a baseline correction is performed using a “blank” measure-
ment obtained by  filling  the  sample compartment  with  the  solvent.  In  a  similar manner,  for  our  PA  spectrometer,  a 
blank  dataset  was  acquired  with  the  tubes  filled  with  ultrapure  water  (or  the  solvent  when  available).  For  baseline 

 
 
 
4  of  20 

correction and suppression of the background signal of the tubes, the blank dataset was coherently subtracted from the 
averaged signals of the tube filled with the sample (subtraction of the radio-frequency signals). Thereby, the effective 
signals from the contrast-agent sample were isolated. During a series of measurements, blank datasets were recorded 
on a regular basis (between two different samples) to ensure an accurate correction and, at the same time, to verify that 
the tube was not polluted by a sample (comparison with a previous blank dataset to check for sample-induced persistent 
absorption). Following the baseline correction, the Hilbert transform of the corrected signals was computed to obtain 
quadrature signals. The in-phase signals and quadrature signals were beamformed independently using a simple delay-
and-sum  image  reconstruction  algorithm to  yield  two  images.  The speed of sound  in the  water bath  was  estimated 
using the measured temperature [17]. Then, an envelope-detected image was computed from the root-mean square of 
the two images for each pixel. The envelope-detected image of a sample injected in four tubes is presented in Figure 1c. 
Each tube  appeared  as a  Gaussian  spot,  and  its amplitude  APA  (λ)  was  determined  using  a  2D  Gaussian  fit.  APA  (λ) 
depends on the tube, the sample, and the optical wavelength λ. 

2.2. Calibrated Measurements with the PA Spectrometer 

The calibration of the PA spectrometer aims at retrieving a PA spectrum  θPA(λ) in the spectroscopic units of the 
absorption coefficient µa(λ), typically cm−1, from APA (λ), while avoiding any tedious calibration of the ultrasound de-
tector, determination of the light fluence distribution, or any precise alignment. We base our calibration process on a 
calibration per sample container and per acquisition series using a calibration solution injected in the tube prior to the 
samples in the series of measurements. 

2.2.1. The Photoacoustic Coefficient of a Sample θPA(λ) 

For the laser pulse width and the dimension of the tube used here, the thermal and stress confinement regimes are 
satisfied  [18].  Therefore, the  thermal  expansion  of  the  sample  inside  the  tube  is  expected to cause a pressure  rise  p0 
proportional to the absorption coefficient µa(λ) of the sample: 

𝑝0(𝜆) = 𝛷(𝜆) ⋅ 𝛤𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ⋅ 𝜂𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒(𝜆) ⋅ 𝜇𝑎(𝜆), 

(1) 

where  𝛷(𝜆)  is the local light fluence at the tube location for the wavelength λ, and Γwater is the Grüneisen coefficient 
of water. Water is the main constituent of the aqueous solutions used here.  ηsample is the dimensionless photoacoustic 
generation efficiency (PGE) of the sample. It corresponds to the efficiency of the PA pressure generation compared to a 
sample for which the absorbed energy is fully converted into pressure in a medium with the Grüneisen coefficient of 
the water. According to the conventional photoacoustic theory [19], ηsample can be expressed as: 

𝜂𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒(𝜆) = 𝐸𝑝𝑡,𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 (𝜆) ⋅ 𝛤𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 𝛤𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟

⁄

, 

(2) 

where  Ept,sample  and Γsample  are  the photothermal conversion  efficiency  and the Grüneisen coefficient of  the  sample 
solution, respectively. The photothermal conversion efficiency  Ept,sample is the ratio of the energy effectively converted 
into  a  thermal  increase  of  the  solution  (and  subsequently  to  production  of  ultrasound  waves)  to  the  total  absorbed 
optical energy. Ept,sample may be inferior to 1, due to various competitive pathways [9]⁠. For molecular absorbers, fluores-
cence and other energy-transfer mechanisms [12] can attenuate the conversion efficiency. A realistic value for the Grü-
neisen coefficient of water taken from the literature is Γwater = 0.12 at 22 °C [20], but the presence of solute and salts may 
increase the Grüneisen coefficient Γsample of the aqueous solution.   

In our experimental setup, 𝛷(𝜆)  and Γwater are independent of the sample placed in the tube. Therefore, the sample-

dependent factors of Equation (1) can be isolated in a quantity θPA(λ), named here the PA coefficient of the sample: 

𝜃𝑃𝐴(𝜆) = 𝜂𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒(𝜆) ⋅ 𝜇𝑎(𝜆), 

(3) 

The photoacoustic coefficient corresponds to the optical absorption coefficient of the sample, restricted to the ab-
sorption effectively transferred into heat to the surroundings of the absorbing agent and corrected for the potentially 
modified Grüneisen coefficient compared to the main solvent: water. 

For non-scattering solutions, the absorption coefficient µa(λ) is equal to the attenuation coefficient µSPP(λ) and can 
be directly measured with spectrophotometry (SPP) in transmission mode. Using the measured absorbance AbsSPP (λ) 
of a solution, µSPP(λ) was obtained with the following formula: 

𝐴𝑏𝑠𝑆𝑃𝑃(𝜆) =

𝜇𝑆𝑃𝑃(𝜆)
𝑙𝑛(10)

⋅ 𝐿 = µ10

𝑆𝑃𝑃(𝜆) ⋅ 𝐿, 

(4) 

 
 
 
5  of  20 

where L = 1 cm is the length of the SPP cuvette, and ln is the natural logarithm.  µ10

𝑆𝑃𝑃(𝜆)is the decadic absorption 

coefficient. 

2.2.2. Theoretical Relationship between APA and θPA(λ) 

The amplitude of the ultrasound signal recorded with the ultrasound system is proportional to the pressure rise p0 
generated in the illuminated tube. Moreover, the “delay and sum” image reconstruction process used here is linear. 
Therefore, the amplitude APA (λ) computed from the image is proportional to p0. Furthermore, the ultrasound signals 
were corrected for the pulse-to-pulse energy fluctuations of the laser. Therefore, the theoretical relationship between 
APA and θPA(λ) can be expressed as: 

𝐴𝑃𝐴(𝜆) = 𝜈𝑈𝑆 ∙ 𝛷𝑎𝑣𝑔(𝜆) ∙ 𝜈𝑃𝑦(𝜆) ∙ 𝛤𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ⋅ 𝜃𝑃𝐴(𝜆)   = 𝛿𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒(𝜆) ⋅ 𝜃𝑃𝐴(𝜆), 

(5) 

where  𝜈𝑈𝑆  is a coefficient that accounts for the global conversion of  p0 in the arbitrary units of the beamformed 
image,  𝛷𝑎𝑣𝑔(𝜆)  is the pulse-average spectral energy distribution of the laser, and  𝜈𝑃𝑦(𝜆)  is a coefficient that accounts 
for the pyrometer spectral sensitivity and the optical attenuation between the laser output and the tube. These factors 
can be gathered in a proportionality factor  𝛿tube(λ).  𝛿tube(λ) ensures the conversion between the arbitrary units of  APA 
and the spectroscopic units of µa(λ).  𝛿tube(λ) is independent of the sample but dependent of the optical wavelength and 
of the tube location in the image.   

The calibration process consists in assessing  𝛿tube(λ) using a reference solution for which APAcalibration (λ), µacalibration(λ), 

and ηcalibration(λ) have been predetermined: 

𝛿𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒(𝜆) = 𝐴𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

𝑃𝐴

(𝜆) (𝜂𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝜆) ⋅ 𝜇𝑎

⁄

𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝜆))

, 

(6) 

Each series of measurements started and ended with two acquisitions with the calibration solution per tube.  𝐴̃PA-

calibration (λ) was computed as the median value over the four acquisitions. 

The choice of the calibration solution is presented in Section 2.3.2. We chose a calibration solution for which ηcalibration 
is  independent  of  the  optical  wavelength.  However,  the  determination  of  ηcalibration  was  not  straightforward.  Without 
prior knowledge of ηcalibration, the following quantities were computed:

2.2.3. Statistical Evaluation 

Typically, 2 to 3 acquisitions in 4 tubes were performed to reach 8 to 12 measurements of the PA spectrum per 
sample. The median of the computed quantity was used as an estimate to avoid outliers due to possible injection errors. 
The median estimate was notated: 

For the evaluation of the measurement error, we used the median absolute deviation MAD, defined as: 

MAD(𝑋) = 1.4826 ∙ median( |𝑋 − 𝑋̃| )  

𝑋̃ = median(𝑋)  

(9) 

(10) 

The scale factor ensures that the value of MAD is comparable with the value of the standard deviation if the  X 

values are normally distributed. 

When expected values are known, the median relative error (MRE) was computed. For example, ξPA is expected to 

be equal to µacalibration for an acquisition corresponding to the calibration solution. The MRE is defined as: 

MRE(𝜉𝑃𝐴(𝜆), 𝜇𝑎(𝜆)) =

𝜇𝑎(𝜆)

∙ 1.4826 ∙ median( |𝜉𝑃𝐴(𝜆) − 𝜇𝑎(𝜆)| )

2.3. Preparation of the Absorbing Solutions 

All solutions were prepared at room temperature. Two different groups of solutions were prepared: non-fluores-
cent  and non-scattering molecular  solutions  and  commonlyused  PA contrast  agents,  which  are  either fluorescent  or 
scattering.   

2.3.1. Non-Fluorescent and Non-Scattering Molecular Solutions 

Three different  water-soluble molecular absorbers  with  a photothermal conversion  efficiency  Ep  that can be  as-
sumed  to  be  equal  to  1  were  selected  for  the  characterization  of  the  PA  spectrometer:  cupric  sulfate  pentahydrate 
(CuSO4·5H2O, ACS reagent, ≥98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O, ACS 
reagent, ≥98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and nigrosin (Nigrosin, 198285, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 
USA). These compounds absorb in the investigated optical range 680–970 nm. The assumption of Ept = 1 means that all 
the absorbed optical energy is transferred to the solution into heat. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other de-
excitation pathway for these compounds. For CuSO4·5H2O and NiSO4·6H2O, the assumption of Ept =1 has previously 
been reported for aqueous solutions of copper (II) chloride and nickel(II) chloride  [9]. Nigrosin is non-florescent dye 
that was used to provide controlled optical absorption to tissue mimicking phantoms [21]. Nigrosin was excited away 
from its absorption peak, which is around 570 nm, and was found to be photostable. 

Stock solutions were prepared to obtain a maximum absorption coefficient around µa = 7 cm−1 in the wavelength 
range 680–970 nm. The stock solutions were prepared by adding crystals or powder in a 50.0 mL volumetric glass flask. 
The mass  for  each compound  is  given  in Table 2.  The  flask  was  gradually  filled  with  ultrapure  water (resistivity  18 
MΩ·cm, Purelab Option Q, ELGA LabWater) to dissolve the crystals/powder and obtain an accurate concentration. We 
observed a volume contraction when dissolving the sulfate crystals. Dilutions of the stock solution were performed to 
prepare percent solutions (v/v %): 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20%. A mix solution, named mix-SO4, was also prepared, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consisting  of  30%  (v/v) CuSO4·5H2O  stock  solution,  30%  NiSO4·6H2O  stock  solution,  and  40%  water. Mixtures  of the 
sulfate solutions with the nigrosin solution were found to form a precipitate and were not used.

The compounds have similar low molar mass (Table 2) and are water soluble at the prepared concentrations. There-
fore, the solutions were not optically scattering. The absorption coefficients of all the prepared solutions were obtained 
with  Equation  (4),  and  the  optical  absorbance  spectra  were  measured  with  a  UV-Vis-NIR  spectrophotometer  (Cary 
6000i, Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA) in transmission mode. Figure 3 displays the absorption coefficients of the stock 
solutions.

with ultrapure water. 

2.3.2. Choice of the Calibration Solution 

The calibration solution was chosen within the three non-fluorescent and non-scattering molecular solutions de-

scribed in Section 2.3.1 so that  𝛿tube(λ) could be computed with Equation (6). Several key features were considered.   

The first requirement for the calibration solution is the ability to determine its coefficient of absorption µacalibration (λ) 
with SPP. All three solutions are non-scattering and hence meet this criterion. Second, the calibration solution should 
have a significant absorption coefficient over the entire investigated spectral range of 680–970 nm to ensure an accurate 
evaluation of APAcalibration (λ). Figure 3 shows that none of the three compounds has a constant absorption coefficient over 
the considered range. However, CuSO4·5H2O can be considered to have the flattest spectrum because it has the lowest 
relative range of µa (ratio of the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values to the mean value) 
(Table 2). Third, the calibration solution should be photostable and chemically stable so that the absorption spectrum 
does not change during the measurement process. Our investigations show that the three compounds meet those crite-
ria. Moreover, inorganic compounds CuSO4·5H2O and NiSO4·6H2O were shown to have a long-term photostability (no 
photobleaching) even under exposure to high-power laser pulses [11]. For long-term use, the preparation of the calibra-
tion solution should be highly reproducible. The sulfate salts are available commercially with a high chemical purity, 
which ensures a good reproducibility. However, nigrosin is a mixture of organic dyes, so the variability from one batch 
to another should be considered. The last requirement is the determination of the PA generation efficiency (PGE) of the 
calibration solution ηcalibration. The photothermal conversion efficiency  Ept of the three stock solutions is assumed to be 
equal to 1, but the Grüneisen coefficient relative to water  Γ/Γwater should also be known (Equation (2)). The molar ab-
sorptivity  of  nigrosin  allows  it  to  have  a  dye  concentration  around  1  mM  for  the  stock  solution.  Therefore,  the

contribution of the dye to the Grüneisen coefficient can be neglected to assume that  ηnigrosin = 1. For CuSO4·5H2O and 
NiSO4·6H2O, Fonseca et al. [11] reported that Γ/Γwater is wavelength-independent in the range 740 to 1100 nm. However, 
the molar concentration for the stock solutions was several orders of magnitude larger than for nigrosin (Table 2) and, 
at these concentrations of sulfate salts, the Grüneisen coefficient significantly differs from Γwater [11]. Fonseca et al. [11] 
proposed an empirical formula to determine Γ/Γwater of the sulfate solutions. However, we were not able to confirm this 
empirical formula.   

With all these criteria and because cupric sulfate pentahydrate solutions have already been used as a model me-
dium in PAI [11,22], our choice was: (1) to use the stock solution of CuSO4·5H2O as the calibration solution and (2) to 
determine ηcalibration using measurements performed with solutions of nigrosin.   

2.3.3. Commonly Used PA Contrast Agents 

The PA spectrometer was tested on two different PA contrast agents based on nanoparticles and dyes, respectively. 
First, the nanoparticle solution was a commercial dispersion of citrate-capped gold nanorods (GNR) in water (10 ± 2 nm 
diameter, 42 ± 8 nm length, concentration 35 µg/mol, Sigma-Aldrich) with a nominal maximum extinction at 808 nm. 
The attenuation coefficient µSPP(λ) was evaluated with SPP (V650, Jasco, Japan) in the wavelength range 680–900 nm. 
SPP baseline correction and PAI blank datasets were performed with ultrapure water. Due to scattering, µSPP is expected 
to differ from µa. 

For the dye agent, solutions of indocyanine green (ICG, pharmaceutical primary standard, Sigma-Aldrich) at dif-
ferent concentrations were prepared. First, a stock solution was prepared by dissolving 7.4 mg of powder in 1.5 mL of 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (concentration of 6.4 mM). This stock solution was diluted to obtain 5 concentrations of 
ICG: 5.5, 7, 9, 12, and 15 μM, each in 25.0 mL of solvent. The final solvent composition was 98.9% Dulbecco’s Phosphate 
Buffered Saline (concentrated ×1 DPBS, Gibco), 1% DMSO, and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich). Tween 20 is a non-ionic 
surfactant that forms micelles and stabilizes the dye  [23]⁠. Additionally, a solution at 7 µM of ICG was prepared in a 
solvent without Tween 20. Since ICG is known to be unstable in aqueous solutions and photosensitive, the solutions 
were  stored  in  amber  glass  vials,  and  PA  spectra  acquired  within  1  h  after  their  preparation.  In  parallel  to  the  PAI 
measurements, the absorption coefficients of the solutions µa(λ) were measured by SPP (V650) in the wavelength range 
680–900 nm. The scattering of the solution was negligible in the spectral range of interest. SPP baseline correction and 
PAI blank datasets were obtained with the solvent. 

3. Results 

3.1. Robustness of the Measurements with the Calibration Solution 

Robust measurements with the calibration solution are crucial for the reliability of the calibration process. There-

fore, the calibration solution itself was used to evaluate the measurement variability.   

3.1.1. Measurement Repeatability 

The measurement repeatability, under different injection conditions, was evaluated simultaneously in a series of 
10 acquisitions. In tube 1 (Figure 1c), the calibration solution was injected before the first acquisition and left untouched 
for the whole series to assess the intrinsic measurement fluctuations of the system. For tube 2, 50 µL of the calibration 
solution was injected before each acquisition (without flushing with water and air) to measure the variations due to the 
injection process. Tube 3 was flushed with air only, and the calibration solution was injected between each acquisition. 
Flushing with air prevented the mixing of samples corresponding to two successive acquisitions. Finally, tube 4 was 
cleaned with water and air, and the calibration solution was injected between successive acquisitions. 

𝑃𝐴
𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

For each tube,  𝐴̃

(𝜆)  was computed over the 10 acquisitions (Figure 4a). The values depend on the tube, 
and the variations can be attributed to the spatial heterogeneities of the light distribution and of the ultrasound detec-
tion. The wavelength dependency is caused by the spectrum of the calibration solution, the spectral sensitivity of the 
power meter, and the wavelength-dependent laser power at the fiber input and after propagation in the optical fibers 
and in water. Then, ΨPAi (λ) was computed from Equation (7) for each acquisition i. The expected value for ΨPAi (λ) is 
one. The median relative error MRE(ΨPA(λ),1) was calculated for each tube and each wavelength λ according to equation 
(11) and is displayed in Figure 4b. Additionally, each spectrum ΨPAi was fitted to a flat spectrum (of amplitude one for 
all λ), assuming a direct proportionality. The fitting factor γi has an expected value of one. The MRE of γi for each tube 
is shown in Figure 4c.

tions were applied for the 4 tubes. Tube 1: the solution was injected once. Tube 2: the solution was re-injected. Tube 3: the tube was

𝑃𝐴
𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

The MRE for ΨPAi (λ) is below 2% for all the wavelengths and the tubes, while they are below 1% for the fitting 
factor γ. These low percentages demonstrate an excellent repeatability of the measurement. The main source of fluctu-
ations is the injection of the solution. Flushing with air resulted in similar fluctuations as re-injecting without flushing. 
However, the injection with cleaning (tube 4) had the strongest variation. This variation could be attributed to droplets 
of the  solvents,  which may  stay  in the tube (or  the needle) and could result  in  dilution  of  the  injected  solution. The 
global fluctuations in amplitude of the spectrum (Figure 4c) were found to be lower than for individual wavelengths 
(Figure 4b), which suggests additional sources of fluctuations at each wavelength. For all tubes, the MRE is stable over 
the wavelength range 680–920 nm and increases in the range 920–970 nm. This increase could be attributed to the lower 
laser fluence at the tube location above 920 nm. Indeed, the absorption of the laser radiation by water between the fiber 
output and the sample is stronger above 920 nm [24]⁠. Consequently,  𝐴̃
(𝜆)  is smaller (Figure 4a), resulting in 
an amplification of the errors in the estimation of ΨPAi (λ) for λ > 920 nm.

The  evaluation  of  𝐴̃

(𝜆)  is crucial  for the calibration of the system  and needs to be performed for  each 
series of measurements, since no precise alignment is executed. Because of the measurement variability, the number of

The following experiment was carried out. Seven pairs of acquisitions with the calibration solution injected in the 
four tubes were performed (total of 14 acquisitions). Between two successive pairs, at least 10 acquisitions with other 
solutions were performed. Each pair was preceded with a blank acquisition of water, and the four tubes were flushed 
with air only between the two injections of the calibration solution.

and shows values below 2%, similarly to Figure 4b. MRE(γ,1) was equal to 1.2% when ΨPA was fitted with a flat spectrum 
of amplitude unity. It should be notated that the 56 evaluations (14 acquisitions in  four tubes) of ΨPA(λ) and γ were 
considered, adding the inter-tube variability compared to in Section 3.1.1.

computed for the (14 – m) other acquisitions. All the combinations of 14 acquisitions taken m at a time were used for the 
computation of the MRE, which corresponds to 4368 spectra for m = 2. Figure 5b shows the global decrease of the error 
with increasing m. The statistical evaluations with m = 2 and m = 4 are highlighted in Figure 5. The error is statically 
below 3% for the entire spectral range.   

3.1.3. Measurement Protocol for a Series of Samples 

In practice,  we chose to start and  to  end  each series  of measurements  with two consecutive  acquisitions  of the 
calibration solution to have at least four acquisitions (two before and two after) per tube to compute  𝐴̃
(𝜆). For 
the samples, the spectra were computed using two consecutive acquisitions. Between the two acquisitions of the same 
sample, the tubes were flushed with air before being injected again with 15 µL of the sample. Between two different 
samples, the tubes were flushed with air and the solvent to clean them and again with air to avoid dilution of the next 
sample. A blank dataset was acquired between two different samples when the tubes were filled with the solvent.

3.2.1. Linearity of the PA Spectrometer 

𝑃𝐴
𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

The linearity of the spectrometer was tested on the nigrosin solutions, as the PGE of nigrosin ηnigrosin is expected to 
be independent of the concentration and the wavelength. Experiments were performed at 20.5 °C ± 0.2 °C (median ± 
MAD).  𝐴̃
(𝜆)  was computed from six acquisitions per tube. ξPA was computed for the five percent solutions of 
nigrosin  and  for  four  acquisitions  in  four  tubes  for  each  solution.  Figure  6a  shows  the  proportionality  of  ξPA  to  the 
absorption coefficient for three wavelengths and the five solutions. The proportionality factor should be equal to 1/ηcali-
bration and was found to be equal to 0.79, which indicates that the PGE of the calibration solution ηcalibration is, as expected, 
greater than one. Figure 6b presents the measured spectra for the 40% and the 60% solutions. Only two solutions were 
presented here for the sake of legibility. The spectra ξPA(λ) were fit with a corresponding absorption spectra µa(λ) as-
suming a direct proportionality. The error between the fitted spectrum and ξPA(λ) was found below 5% for λ < 930 nm 
(Figure 6c). These results demonstrate that the spectral shape of the nigrosin solution could be retrieved by computing 
ξPA(λ) using the calibration solution of CuSO4·5H2O. The proportionally factor was assessed on the five solutions to be 
equal to 0.796 ± 0.015 (median ± MAD), which corresponds to ηcalibration = 1.256 ± 0.023.

were α40% = 0.81 and α60% = 0.80, respectively. (c) MRE of ξPA with α∙µa as a reference for the 40% and 60% percent solutions. 

3.2.2. Evolution of ηsample/ηcalibration with the Concentration and the Temperature for the Dif-
ferent Solutions 

For the percent solutions of CuSO4 and NiSO4, and for the solution mix-SO4, the PGE was shown to be wavelength-
independent  in  the  range  740  nm  to  980  nm  [11].  For  the  percent  solutions  of  nigrosin,  the  PGE  is  expected  to  be 

 
 
 
 
wavelength-independent for the range 680–980 nm. Hence, the spectra ξPA(λ) are expected to be directly proportional 
to the absorption spectra µa(λ), in the range where the PGE is constant.

According to Fonseca et al. [11], for the solutions of CuSO4 and NiSO4, the coefficient αsample depends on the concen-

tration with the empirical law: 

𝛼𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 = 𝛼0 ⋅ (1 + 𝛽𝐶𝑢𝑆𝑂4 ∙ 𝑐𝐶𝑢𝑆𝑂4 + 𝛽𝑁𝑖𝑆𝑂4 ∙ 𝑐𝑁𝑖𝑆𝑂4) 

(13) 

where cCuSO4 and cNiSO4 are the molar concentrations of CuSO4·5H2O and NiSO4·6H2O, respectively, and theoretically, 
α0 = 1/ηcalibration. The coefficients βCuSO4F = 0.708 M−1 (at 23.0 °C) and βNiSO4F = 0.325 M−1 (at 22.6 °C) were determined experi-
mentally for wavelengths between 1400 and 1500 nm where the absorption was dominated by water and not by the 
solutes.   

The PA spectra ξPA(λ) of the solutions of CuSO4, NiSO4, and nigrosin, as well as the solution mix-SO4, were meas-
ured at two different temperatures of the water bath: 20.3 °C ± 0.2 °C and 25.0 °C ± 0.2 °C. Samples with similar absorp-
tion were grouped together, and the groups were measured by ascending order of absorption. Each of the 16 samples 
was  injected  and  measured  twice  in  four  tubes.  The  calibration  solution  was  measured  twice  before  and  after  each 
group, resulting in 12 measurements per tube to compute  𝐴̃
(𝜆). The proportionality factors αsample were evalu-
ated with a curve-fitting algorithm from  𝜉̃𝑃𝐴(𝜆). Figure 7a–e presents the spectra ξPA(λ) for the different groups of so-
lutions,  together  with  the  fits  and  the  measured  spectra  µa(λ).  Figure  7f  presents  αsample  as  a  function  of  the  dilution 
percentage  of the  stock solution.  The  solution mix-SO4  was placed  in  Figure  7c  (intitled  60%)  due to the  absorption 
values, but it was placed at 30% in Figure 7f because of the percentage of the stock solution of NiSO4 used.

the stock solution of NiSO4. The dotted lines are the linear regressions. The same colors as for ξPA(λ) were used. 

For the solutions of nigrosin, the different spectra ξPA(λ) were fitted by the corresponding spectra µa(λ) over the 
entire spectral range for all the percent solutions. However, the values of αsample were larger at 25 °C than at 20 °C for all 
the samples. The values of αsample could be considered as independent of the concentration, and the constant value was 
evaluated by the median (Table 3). The corresponding PGEs of the calibration solution were ηcalibration(20 °C) = 1.253 ± 
0.003 (median ± MAD) and ηcalibration(25 °C) = 1.107 ± 0.062. The value at 20 °C is consistent with the value found with the 
experiment described in Section 3.2.1., while the two series of measurements were performed at different dates. With 
Equation (13) and the value βCuSO4F, the computed PGE at 23 °C will be ηFcalibration(23 °C) = 1.177. Therefore, the measured 
and computed evaluations of ηcalibration consistently decrease with increasing temperature. This result indicates that the 
temperature  of  the  water  bath  is  an  important  parameter  to  obtain  an  accurate  quantification  with  our  calibration 
method. The median value of ηcalibration determined with the nigrosin solutions was used for the computation of θPA(λ) 
with Equation (8). 

For the solutions of CuSO4, we can notice that the spectra ξPA(λ) at 20 °C and at 25 °C are superimposed and are 
fitted by the corresponding spectra µa(λ) over the entire spectral range. As expected, αCuSO4,100% is close to one and in-
creases linearly with the increasing concentration of CuSO4·5H2O. βCuSO4 was determined by linear regression to be of 
the order of 1.0 (Table 3), which is 41% higher than the value of βCuSO4F determined by Fonseca et al. For NiSO4, ξPA(λ) 
has higher values at 20 °C than at 25 °C. For the stock solution (100%), the coefficient αsample was found to be larger than 
1.5,  and  the values of  ξPA(λ)  were  lower than  𝛼𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 ∙ µ𝑎(𝜆)  for  λ <  740 nm.  For the  20% and  40%  solutions,  the  fit 
matches over the whole spectral range (even for λ < 740 nm). By fitting for λ > 740 nm, the coefficient αsample was found 
to vary linearly with the concentration, but the coefficient βNiSO4 was found to be equal to 0.74 M−1 at 20 °C and 0.65 M−1 
at 25 °C. These values of βNiSO4 are at least two times larger than the values determined by Fonseca et al. The values of 
α0 (Table 3) also differ from the empirical model proposed by Fonseca et al. Indeed, they were determined to be in the 
same order of magnitude as for the nigrosin, but they did not match the values or the variation with the temperature 
found for the nigrosin. α0 was found to be constant for CuSO4 and decreasing for NiSO4. 

For the mix-SO4, we found αmix-SO4(20 °C) = 1.24 and αmix-SO4(25 °C) = 1.15, while the value from Fonseca et al. would 
be αFmix-SO4(23 °C) = 1.01. While each of the stock solutions contributes to 30% of the mix-SO4, the molar concentration of 
NiSO4 in the solution is about five times larger than CuSO4. Thereby, the contribution of NiSO4 dominates in αmix-SO4, 
which explains the values above one and the decreasing value with the increasing temperature. However, because of 
the various values of α0 for CuSO4 and NiSO4, we were not able to verify an empirical law similar to Equation (13). The 
discrepancy between our results and the results of Fonseca et al. are further discussed in Section 4.

3.3. Characterization of Conventional Contrast Agents   

3.3.1. Gold Nanorods 

The solution of gold nanorods (GNR) was measured in a series of acquisitions together with the 20% solutions of 
nigrosin and CuSO4. The experiments were performed at 20.7 ± 0.2 °C, and the ηcalibration determined in Section 3.2.1 was 
used to compute the PA coefficient θPA(λ). The laser fluence was lowered at 2 mJ.cm−2 at 730 nm with polarizing optics 
placed before the input of the fiber bundle. The lower fluence aimed at preserving the photostability of the gold nano-
rods. Figure 8a displays the spectra θPA(λ) for the solutions and the attenuation coefficient µSPP(λ) measured by SPP, 
and Figure 8b presents the ratio between the two quantities in the range 680–900 nm. For the non-scattering solutions, 

 
 
 
13  of  20 

(nigrosin and CuSO4), µSPP(λ) is equal to the absorption coefficient µa(λ), and the ratio  𝜃̃𝑃𝐴/µ𝑎 was found to be constant, 
as expected from Section 3.2.2. The median of the ratio was found to be equal to 0.99 for the nigrosin, which validates 
the capabilities  of  the  system to operate  at different  laser fluences.  For CuSO4, the  PGE  was  estimated  to  1.08,  as  in 
Section 3.2.2.   

For the GNR, we first verified that the spectra of the sample were stable during the measurement by computing 
the spectra APA without averaging the ultrasound data over the 15 laser sweeps. Then, θPA(λ) was computed with the 
averaged US  data. θPA(λ)  and  µSPP(λ) had  a  similar  spectral shape:  a  broad peak centered  around  800 nm and  a  full 
width at half the maximum of ~130 nm. However, the spectral shapes did not match with a direct proportionality factor 
(proportionality factor for the best fit estimated to 0.74). The ratio  𝜃̃𝑃𝐴/µ𝑆𝑃𝑃 was found to be approximately equal to one 
from 680 nm to 710 nm and then decreasing until 800 nm and quasi constant from 800 nm to 900 nm. This ratio is not 
the PGE because the attenuation coefficient of GNR comprises both the absorption and the scattering coefficients. The 
lower value of θPA compared to µSPP could be explained by the combination of two phenomena. First, the scattering for 
the solution of GNR cannot be neglected, which would result in an overestimation of  µSPP as compared to µa. For the 
geometrical characteristics of the GNR used here, the shapes of the absorption and scattering spectra are expected to 
match (but could be slightly shifted), and the ratio between the scattering and the absorption coefficients could be on 
the order of 10% [25]⁠. Another phenomenon must be accounted for to describe the discrepancy: the GNR is the photo-
thermal converter (heat source) while water is the PA signal-generating medium. Interfacial thermal resistance to the 
heat transfer at the gold–water interface could lower the effective photothermal conversion efficiency [26,27] and then 
reduce the value of θPA. However, the influence of the interfacial thermal resistance on the PA signal is not well under-
stood even at a single wavelength (peak absorption) [28], and by extension its spectral dependency is not yet established.

a solid line. For the GNR, the attenuation coefficient was only available in the range 680 nm–900 nm. The fits of µSPP to  𝜃̃𝑃𝐴  are shown

3.3.2. Indocyanine Green 

Figure 9a displays images at λ2 = 790 nm of a tube filled with (from left to right): the calibration solution, ICG in an 
aqueous solution without Tween, and ICG stabilized in micelles using 0.1% of Tween. For the calibration solution and 
the ICG with Tween, the images of the tube are similar: one spot with the same center and the same width. Therefore, 
we can assume that the calibration and the sample measurements match. However, for the ICG in an aqueous solution 
without Tween, the image of the tube has two spots along the depth dimension. The position of the dip between the 
two spots was found to correspond to the maximum of the single spot for the other solutions. Because of its affinity 
with hydrophobic surfaces, we can assume that ICG did not stay in the aqueous solution and stuck to the wall of the 
PTFE tube when Tween was not added. The two spots would then correspond to the interferences of the signals gener-
ated by  the  absorbing  walls  in the  limited-view  detection  geometry.  The calibration cannot be  used  for quantitative 
measurements when two spots appear because the amplitude APA does not correspond to the same experimental con-
ditions. These results indicate that surfactants or other compounds are needed to keep hydrophobic absorbers in solu-
tion for quantitative accuracy of the measurements. All the other measurements with ICG were performed in a solution 
comprised of 0.1% of Tween 20 [29]. 

 
 
 
 
14  of  20 

The solutions of ICG were measured at a temperature of 22.0 °C ± 0.7 °C. ηcalibration was computed assuming a linear 
variation between  20  °C  and  25 °C. A  total  of  12  evaluations  were performed per solution.  Figure  9b,c  displays  the 
spectra θPA(λ) and µa(λ), respectively, for five concentrations of ICG and in the range 680–900 nm. The absorption of 
ICG  above  900  nm  is negligible because of  the shape of  the  spectra  and  was not displayed  for better  legibility.  The 
scattering could be neglected, and µa(λ) was measured with SPP for the solutions of ICG. The PA and optical spectra 
have a peak around λ2 = 790 nm and a shoulder around λ1 = 742 nm. The PGE ηICG was assessed with Equation (3) and 
depends on both the wavelength and the concentration of ICG. Here, the solvent is composed of DPBS with 1% DMSO; 
therefore, the Grüneisen coefficient of the solvent is expected to be slightly larger than  Γwater. However, given its low 
concentration, ICG is not expected to influence the Grüneisen coefficient of the solution contrary to the sulfate salts. Yet, 
the optical properties of ICG can vary with the concentration [12]. At λ1 and λ2, it can be seen that ηICG increases with 
the concentration. The slope is larger at λ2, but the ηICG values are larger at λ1 than at λ2 (Figure 9d). In a similar solvent 
but without Tween, Fuenzalida Werner  et al. [12] determined that ηICG(λ1) ≈ 0.80 and ηICG(λ2) ≈ 0.62 at concentrations 
below 10 µM. These results are consistent with our measurements at c ICG = 9 µM. 

Figure 9f displays the spectra µa(λ) normalized by the ICG concentration. The amplitude of the shoulder at λ1 was 
found to be linear with the concentration with a slope of one, while µa(λ2)/cICG decreased with the increasing concentra-
tion because of the aggregation of ICG at higher concentrations [12]. Therefore, the ratio µa(λ1)/µa(λ2) increases with the 
increasing cICG (Figure 9g). Interestingly, the ratio θPA(λ1)/θPA(λ2) was found to be constant, suggesting a stability of the 
heat transfer from the molecule to the solvent regardless of the concentration and, by extension, of the aggregation state. 
Figure 9e shows that the spectral shape of θPA(λ,cICG) does not depend on the concentration of ICG. This stability of the 
spectral shape was not observed in water without Tween [12], probably because of a stronger aggregation of ICG mol-
ecules when they are not in micelles of Tween. The normalization factor used for θPA(λ,cICG), however, is not directly 
1/cICG  as  for µa(λ), but  it  is proportional to 1/(ηICG(λ1,cICG)  ×  cICG).  Therefore,  the  PA  signal  generation  increases non-
linearly with cICG. The aggregation of ICG is expected to decrease the fluorescence efficiency, a competitive process to 
PA, and therefore benefits PA generation at higher concentrations, which is seen by the increase of ηICG (Figure 9d).

4. Discussion 

We presented and validated a method to perform calibrated photoacoustic spectrometry in the wavelength range 
680 to 970 nm with a commonly used PAI setup. The method requires successive injections in tubes that remain me-
chanically fixed and immersed in a water bath at a stable temperature. Three solutions need to be injected: water or a 
solvent  as  a background  reference,  a solution  of CuSO4·5H2O  at 0.25  M  as  a calibration  solution,  and  the  sample of 
interest. The  simple calibration process provides  PA spectra  in  spectroscopic  units  that can be related to the  optical 
attenuation spectra (SPP), both in terms of shape and amplitude. The ratio between the PA spectrum θPA and the optical 
absorption spectrum µa yields the photoacoustic generation efficiency of the sample. Even if the absorption spectrum is 
not available for some samples, for instance, because of strong scattering, the PA spectra expressed in SI units can be 
compared to other samples.   

The developed method requires the sample containers, the illumination, and the ultrasound detector to be stable 
during a series of measurement, but their respective position does not require a precise alignment. The method can even 
operate with a steady but nonuniform fluence distribution and ultrasound sensitivity. We also showed that the method 
can operate when the tubes are embedded in a tissue phantom (Appendix B). The developed calibration method can be 
adapted to various PAI systems, as long as they provide access to the PA-generated ultrasound signals or the beam-
formed  images  prior  to  envelope  detection  (to  allow  coherent  subtraction  of  the  background)  and  the  pulse-energy 
fluctuations of the excitation light at each wavelength. Although radio-frequency data may not be available on all ul-
trasound machines [30], they are usually accessible on current conventional PAI systems. We applied here the method 
to a PAI system based on a clinical ultrasound array and carefully adapted the sample size to the frequency bandwidth 
of the detector. For other systems, the tube radius may be adapted for optimal sensitivity using Equation (A2) in Ap-
pendix A. To ensure a good transmission of ultrasound waves, the wall thickness should be as small as possible com-
pared to the acoustic wavelength in the material at the center frequency of the detector. Furthermore, the material of 
the tube should have an acoustic impedance close to water (Zwater = 1.49 Mray), as in the case of PTFE (ZPTFE = 2.97 Mray 
[31]). The wavelength at the center frequency is 0.3 mm in the material (vsPTFE = 1390 m.s−1). With a wall thickness of 0.1 
mm, the transmission coefficient T in pressure through the three-layered system water–PTFE–water is [32]⁠: T = 75% at 
25 °C and at 5 MHz. For comparison, a glass tube with the same wall thickness would yield T = 10%. Additional prop-
erties of the tube should be a weak optical absorption and scattering, and the material of the tube should be chosen to 
be chemically inert to avoid interaction with the sample. Our PTFE tubes had all the required properties, and they are 
commercially available in various diameters and wall thicknesses. For independent measurements using multiple tubes, 
the necessary  spacing between  them  in the  tube phantom  should be at  least  superior to  the  spatial  resolution  of  the 
system, and a margin should be taken to avoid artifacts caused by side lobes. For PAI systems with an array focused in 
the elevational direction, the tube may be placed in the acoustic elevational focus for higher sensitivity.   

Using tubes as sample containers has several advantages over the containers used in other PA spectrometers: Beard 
et al. [9] used a homemade cuvette, Fuenzalida Werner et al. [12] used a single channel microscopy chip, and Pelivanov 
et al. [13] ⁠enclosed their sample within a diaphragm between two quartz plates. For these containers, only one sample 
can be measured at a time, and changing to another sample may require tedious preparation procedures. For our sys-
tem, several tubes could be positioned in the imaged region. This allowed parallel measurements of different samples 
or for the evaluation of the variability of the measurement for one type of sample. Because tubes have two opened ends, 
they could also easily be flushed, and the same tube could be used for a series of successive measurements. As the PTFE 
tubes are cost-effective, they were replaced as soon as they were polluted (persistent and additional absorption com-
pared to the first blank dataset) or degraded. The small volume of the tubes (15 µL) is an asset to test samples at very 
early stages of the development of new contrast agents and for screening when only small quantities have been synthe-
sized. However, the injection challenges compared to large cuvettes induce a variability that was reduced here by per-
forming statistical evaluations over several injections. An automated sample injector, as is used in high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC), might be considered in future development. 

The sensitivity of the spectrophotometer increases with the laser fluence and the detector sensitivity. The detection 
limit was not determined here, but Figures 7a and 8a show that the 20% solution of nigrosin was measured with a high 
sensitivity even with a low absorption coefficient of µa = 0.3 cm−1 at the two incident fluences 4 mJ.cm−2 and 2 mJ.cm−2 
(evaluated at 730 nm). For comparison, other PA spectrometers reported a lower bound of calibrated detection corre-
sponding to an absorption coefficient µa of 5 cm−1 for the system of Beard et al. [10], 0.4 cm−1 for the system of Fuenzalida 
Werner et al. [12], and 1 cm−1 for the system of Pelivanov et al. [13].   

For the upper bound of calibrated detection, the absorption coefficient of the stock solution was limited to µa stock ≤ 
7 cm−1, which corresponds to an absorption length of ℓstock = 1/µa stock ≈ 1.4 mm. As the tube radius is 14 times smaller 
than  ℓ  stock, the tubes could be considered  as  optically thin. Thereby,  the  decay  of  the optical  fluence  inside the tube 

 
 
 
16  of  20 

lumen caused by the sample absorption and its influence on the amplitude of the PA signal can be neglected. Indeed, 
while  the  absorption  coefficient  of  the  nigrosin  solution  varies  significantly  (relative  range  of  1.5,  Table  2)  over  the 
covered spectral range, the PA spectra were found to have the same spectral shape as the absorption spectrum, without 
any reduction of the signal at larger absorption coefficients (Figure 6). Moreover, the proportionality factor between 
𝜉̃𝑃𝐴(𝜆)  and µa(λ) (Figure 7f) was found to be constant even when the percentage of the stock solution varied from 20% 
to 100%. This latter result also demonstrates that only one calibration solution can be used for  an optical absorption 
coefficient below 7 cm−1. Pelivanov et al. [13] reported the use of several calibration solutions of CuSO4·5H2O to cover 
the absorption range 1–26 cm−1, but the concentration of the calibration solution was not given. Fuenzalida Werner et 
al. [12] reported measurements with a maximum absorption coefficient of 5 cm−1, while other PA spectrometers reported 
a much larger upper bound of detectability: 250 cm−1 for the system of Beard et al. [10] and 26 cm−1 to up to 300 cm−1 for 
the system of Pelivanov et al. [13]. As contrast agents for biomedical photoacoustic imaging can easily be diluted, the 
absorption coefficient of the tested solution can be lowered to fit below an upper limit of calibrated detection of our 
system.   

Our  calibration  method  relies  on  the  injection  in  the  sample  container  of  an  absorbing  solution  (CuSO 4·5H2O) 
whose  photoacoustic  properties  are  known.  Compared  to  India  ink,  used  elsewhere  as  a  reference  solution  [12]⁠, 
CuSO4·5H2O is a molecular absorber of small molecular weight and not a particle-based absorber, so the heat transfer 
to the solvent is direct, resulting in a photothermal conversion efficiency of one. Moreover, the solution is homogeneous 
(no sedimentation), even for volumes as small as 15 µL, and stable. Unfortunately, its Grüneisen coefficient relative to 
water depends on both the concentration and the temperature of the solution, and its values were previously reported 
in only one study, to our knowledge [11]. At the concentration used for the calibration solution, our estimation of the 
photoacoustic  efficiency  matches  with  the  value  reported  by  Fonseca  et  al.  [11].  Pelivanov  et  al.  [13]  also  used 
CuSO4·5H2O  as  a calibration solution, but they  assumed  ηCuSO4  =  1  even  at concentrations  up to  1 M;  therefore,  their 
calibration did not account for the increase in the Grüneisen coefficient with the concentration.  This discrepancy was 
not detected probably because of their use of different concentrations of CuSO4·5H2O as calibration solutions and a lack 
of validation with another reference solution such as nigrosin. Fuenzalida Werner et al.  [12] separated the correction 
method  used  to  obtain  the  shape  of  the  PA  spectrum  from  the  calibration  method  to  estimate  the  amplitude  of  the 
spectrum. They developed a complex correction method adapted to their measurement setup and validated its ability 
to  retrieve  the  shape  of  the  absorption  spectrum  in  the  range  400  nm  to  900  nm  with  solutions  of  NiCl2.  However, 
amplitude calibration was performed in the visible range at 570 nm with Brilliant Black BN (BBN), a dye that is photo-
stable, non-florescent, and for which the photoacoustic efficiency is expected to be equal to  ηBBN = 1. We identified ni-
grosin as a dye with similar properties in the NIR, and we used this highly absorbing dye to evaluate the Grüneisen 
coefficient of our calibration solution of CuSO4. With the determined Grüneisen coefficient, the spectral shape and the 
amplitude of unknown samples were simultaneously obtained. 

The Grüneisen coefficients relative to water of solutions of CuSO4·5H2O and NiSO4·6H2O were measured by Fon-
seca et al. [11] for five different concentrations from 0.125 M to 1 M for CuSO4 and 0.275 M to 2.2 M for NiSO4. According 
to their study, the Grüneisen coefficients of our calibration solution (0.25 M of CuSO4) and of the 40% solution of NiSO4 
(0.55 M of NiSO4) should have the same value, while we found a Grüneisen coefficient at least 16% larger for the 40% 
solution of NiSO4. At a given temperature close to 23 °C, they determined a linear variation of the Grüneisen coefficient 
with the concentration in each solute (Equation (13)). We also found a linear variation for concentrations from 0.05 M 
to 0.25 M for CuSO4 and from 0.26 M to 1.3 M for NiSO4. However, the β factors (Equation (13)) had a large discrepancy 
(Table 3). For CuSO4, our evaluation of βCuSO4 did not depend on the temperature and was 41% larger than the value 
reported by Fonseca et al. (βFCuSO4). For NiSO4, βNiSO4 was found to be larger at low temperature and at least 100% larger 
than βFNiSO4. Additionally, we were not able to confirm the empirical formula for the mix-SO4. One possible explanation 
for the discrepancy of the β values could be the difference in the investigated concentration range and the simplistic 
linear assumption over the whole concentration range investigated by Fonseca et al. However, we could not investigate 
the same concentration range due to the difference in calibrated detection limits of the PA spectrometers. Another major 
difference between the measurement methods is the spectral range in which the Grüneisen coefficient was evaluated. 
Fonseca et al. measured the Grüneisen coefficient based on the absorption of water in a spectral range (1400–1500 nm) 
where  the  absorption coefficient of  CuSO4  and  NiSO4 can  be considered negligible compared  to  water,  whereas  we 
measured the Grüneisen coefficient in a wavelength range where the solute has a strong absorption. We can hypothesize 
that the Grüneisen coefficient differs when the absorption coefficient of the solution is dominated by the solute instead 
of the solvent. Using the same measurement system as Fonseca et al., Stahl [10] evaluated the Grüneisen coefficient of 
an aqueous solution of CuCl2 (cCuCl2 = 200 g.L−1) as a function of the wavelength from 750 nm to 1500 nm. At 20 °C, it was 
observed that the Grüneisen coefficient was stable up to 1150 nm when the absorption was dominated by the solute, 

 
 
 
17  of  20 

while for wavelengths greater than 1380 nm, where the absorption was dominated by water, the Grüneisen coefficient 
increased by 14%. A possible, but not confirmed, explanation could be a Grüneisen coefficient specific to the hydration 
shells around the metallic ions of Cu2+ compared to the rest of the bulk solution. The bulk solution is mainly excited 
when the absorption is dominated by the solvent, as is the case for the experiments reported by Fonseca et al., while the 
hydration shells would have a stronger influence when the absorption is dominated by the solute. Unfortunately, no 
study was reported for different concentrations of Cu2+ and for Ni2+. These results show that the Grüneisen coefficients 
of the sulfate solutions of CuSO4 and NiSO4 depend on the concentration, the temperature, and the wavelength range 
of excitation. Further studies would be needed to use these chromophores at different concentrations in phantoms for 
quantitative multiwavelength photoacoustic imaging. Such studies are beyond the scope of this paper.   

Spectral measurements of commonly used contrast agents in PAI (gold nanorods and ICG) showed results com-
patible with previously reported studies and demonstrated the ability of the spectrometer to characterize different kinds 
of agents: metallic nanostructures and dyes. In particular, the wavelength and concentration-dependent photoacoustic 
generation efficiencies of ICG were verified. Variations of ηICG with the concentration are linked to the changes in the 
photothermal efficiency, in particular due to the dye aggregation and reduced fluorescence. For scattering solutions of 
gold nanorods, as already shown by Pelivanov et al. [13], the PA spectrum enables removal of the influence of the light 
scattering to access to the absorption properties of the solution. Our PA spectral measurement can be used to quantita-
tively characterize the PA properties of plasmonic nanoparticles and is expected to capture the shape of the absorption 
spectrum. However, the photothermal conversion efficiency may be lower than one due to thermal resistance from the 
absorbers to the solvent [26]⁠. Therefore, our calibrated measurement may not exactly match the amplitude of the optical 
absorption coefficient. Comparison  with the  attenuation coefficient measured  with  SPP  in transmission mode could 
provide information about the strength of the scattering and its spectral dependency. 

5. Conclusions 

The design of photoacoustic contrast agents has been demonstrated to be challenging, in particular because the 
photoacoustic  spectrum  may  differ  from  the  optical  attenuation  spectrum  due  to  scattering  and  other  physical  pro-
cesses. Therefore, a calibrated measurement of the photoacoustic spectrum and the photoacoustic generation efficiency 
is highly desirable at all stages of the development of PA contrast agents. We demonstrated a novel method that can be 
adapted to most commonly used photoacoustic imaging systems to obtain calibrated photoacoustic measurements in 
the NIR  range.  Measurements  were performed  with  small sample  volumes  of  15  µL,  and the  detection sensitivity  is 
lower  than  0.3 cm−1. The  system  enables  PA measurements  at very  early  stages  of  the  development  of  new contrast 
agents. This method can benefit the material science and biomedical communities and satisfy the growing need for the 
characterization of photoacoustic contrast agents.

Appendix A 

Appendix A demonstrates the suitability of the ultrasound detector frequency for the sample container. 

 
 
 
18  of  20 

The sample containers are tubes with an inner diameter of 0.2 mm. For an optically thin and infinitely long cylinder 
of water surrounded by water, the PA-generated ultrasound waves captured in the far-field are expected to have an 
acoustic spectrum, which has a magnitude proportional to [33]⁠: 

𝑝(𝑓) ∝

𝐽1(2𝜋

𝑎

𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑓)
𝑣𝑠
, 
√𝑓

(A1) 

where f is the ultrasound frequency, J1 is the first order Bessel function,  𝑎  is the radius of the cylinder, and vswater is 
the speed of sound in water. The first and highest peak of this acoustic spectrum is bounded by the first zero of Equation 
(A1): 

𝑓1𝑠𝑡 𝑧𝑒𝑟𝑜  ≈  3.83  

𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟

𝑣𝑠

2𝜋 𝑎

, 

(A2) 

For an optimal detector sensitivity, the first peak should cover the entire frequency bandwidth of the detector, and 
the first zero should slightly exceed the upper frequency of the ultrasound bandwidth of the detector. The upper fre-
quency of our detector given by the clinical array manufacturer for pulse-echo ultrasound imaging is around 7 MHz. 
For f1st zero ≥ 7 MHz and vswater = 1500 m.s−1, the maximal inner radius of the tube would be 130 µm. With  𝑎  = 100 µm, the 
nominal radius of our tubes, the theoretical spectrum is displayed in Figure 1b with the dashed blue curve. The solid 
black curve presents the ultrasound spectrum for the baseline-corrected signal of one tube. The entire bandwidth of the 
detector was indeed adequately excited by the chosen sample container. 

Appendix B 

Appendix B demonstrates the in vitro capability of the calibration method to operate in a scattering and absorbing 
environment such as biological tissues. This configuration could be used to verify the detectability of a contrast agent 
with the PAI system in a tissue-mimicking phantom, for instance. 

A tissue phantom was implemented: the four PTFE tubes, placed in the same tube holder as described in Section 
2.1.1., were surrounded with raw turkey breast (Figure A1a). The turkey breast was purchased from the local grocery 
store. Three 0.5 cm thick slices of tissue were placed on top of tubes 1 and 3 (Figures 1 and A1c), in between the tubes 
1/3 and 2/4, and below tubes 2 and 4, respectively. Thereby, the tubes were embedded in a 1.5 cm thick tissue block, and 
the laser light was scattered and partially absorbed before reaching the tubes. The in vitro tissue phantom was immersed 
in water with 0.9% NaCl (kitchen salt) at 21.7 °C ± 0.2 °C. 

Acquisitions were performed in the same condition as for the clear medium: the samples were injected in the tubes, 
and blank acquisitions were recorded with ultrapure water inside the tubes. The same data processing was applied to 
obtain the PA coefficient θPA(λ) of the sample (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2). The 100% and the 60% solutions of nigrosin and 
the 80% solution of CuSO4 were measured. As for the clear medium (see Section 3.1.3.), the calibration solution was 
injected twice before and twice after the samples for a total of four acquisitions per tube, and the samples were injected 
twice.   

Figure A1b,c presents the images without and with subtraction of the blank acquisition. The photoacoustic signal 
of the tissue was mainly removed by the subtraction process, enabling extraction of  APA. Figure A1d displays the PA 
coefficient θPA(λ) of the three solutions and the SPP spectra. For the nigrosin samples, we verified that the PA and SPP 
spectra  are  superimposed  (PGE  equal  to  one).  A  PGE  coefficient  of  1.16  was  found  for  the  CuSO4  solution,  which 
matches with Section 3.2.2. 

These results demonstrate that the calibration method can be used in scattering and absorbing media such as an in 

vitro tissue phantom.
