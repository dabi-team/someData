ABSTRACT 

The isolation of air-sensitive two-dimensional (2D) materials and the race to achieve a better control 
of the interfaces in van der Waals heterostructures has pushed the scientific community towards the 
development  of  experimental  setups  that  allow  to  exfoliate  and  transfer  2D  materials  under  inert 
atmospheric conditions. These systems are typically based on over pressurized N2 of Ar gloveboxes 
that  require  the  use  of  very  thick  gloves  to  operate  within  the  chamber  or  the  implementation  of 
several  motorized  micro-manipulators.  Here,  we  set  up  a  deterministic  transfer  system  for  2D 
materials  within  a  gloveless  anaerobic  chamber.  Unlike  other  setups  based  on  over-pressurized 
gloveboxes, in our system the operator can manipulate the 2D materials within the chamber with bare 
hands. This experimental setup allows us to exfoliate 2D materials and to deterministically place them 
at  a  desired  location  with  accuracy  in  a  controlled  O2-free  and  very  low  humidity  (<2%  RH) 
atmosphere.  We  illustrate  the  potential  of  this  system  to  work  with  air-sensitive  2D  materials  by 
comparing the stability of black phosphorus and perovskite flakes inside and outside the anaerobic 
chamber. 

The deterministic transfer methods, that allow for the placement of 2D materials onto a user defined 

specific location with an unprecedented degree of accuracy and reliability, are at the origin of the 

large  success  of two-dimensional (2D)  materials  research.1–6  This control  over the  position  of the 

transferred flakes has been exploited to fabricate devices with rather complex architectures as well as 

to  assemble  artificial  stacks  of  dissimilar  2D  materials  to  build-up  the  so-called  van  der  Waals 

heterostructures.7–10 In particular, deterministic placement methods have enabled the fabrication of 

 
 
 
 
2D-based samples fully-encapsulated between insulating layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), 

exhibiting record-high electronic performance that allowed for the observation of intriguing physical 

phenomena.4,6 Nonetheless, there are two main challenges of this line of research: 1) how to achieve 

a  better  control  of  the  interfaces,11–13  2)  how  to  handle  air-sensitive  2D  materials.14,15  Indeed,  the 

continuous race to increase the performances of 2D devices and the isolation of novel unstable 2D 

materials under atmospheric exposure, have pushed towards the development of experimental setups 

where  the  transfer  process  can  be  carried  out  under  controlled  environmental  conditions.14,16,17 

Although several research groups have implemented their own systems based on N2 or Ar glove-

boxes,  the  literature  is  lacking  of  comprehensive  technical  articles  providing  enough  details  for 

reproducing such systems by other groups. Moreover, these glove-box-based systems can be difficult 

to operate as delicate manual operation (e.g. mechanical exfoliation, handling small substrates with 

tweezers, …) have to be carried out while wearing thick gloves. In order to overcome this handicap, 

some systems are fully motorized and thus do not require any manual operation within the glovebox, 

increasing substantially their cost and complexity of implementation.18 

Here, we present an alternative concept of deterministic transfer setup operated in inert conditions 

that is based on a gloveless anaerobic chamber. The user can operate inside the chamber using his/her 

bare hands without the need of thick glove-box gloves, making the transfer process virtually as easy 

as that carried out in air (outside the anaerobic chamber). Importantly, in the manuscript we provide 

all the details needed to facilitate the implementation of this system by other research groups. 

Table 1 summarizes the different components needed to assemble our experimental system; whose 

cost is under the 20 000 €. We address the reader to the Supp. Info. for pictures of the different steps 

during the setup assembly process and for more details about the setup construction.

Table 1. List of all the setup components, which includes the part numbers and the prices. * Note that the Bactronez 
anaerobic chamber includes: sleeves, elastic rubber sealing rings, sleeve compartment doors, integrated dry vacuum pump 
for the sleeve and the interlock purging, external lights, two sets of oxygen scrubber catalysts. 

We  build  our  transfer system  within a  gloveless  anaerobic  chamber  (Bactronez  12.5).  In  order  to 

access the interior part of the chamber, the system has two sealed doors connected to two plastic 

sleeves equipped with an elastic rubber sealing ring at their free end. The operator inserts his/her bare 

arms in the sleeves until feeling tight the rubber sealing ring around the arms like shown in Figure 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1(b).  Then,  the  sleeves  are  pumped down  and  purged  with  N2  three  times.  After  this  process,  the 

operator  can  open  the  two  sealed  doors  without  altering  the  environmental  conditions  inside  the 

chamber. The system is equipped with a scrubber cartridge with Pd coated pellets (which act as a 

catalyst) that actively remove O2 from the chamber through the reaction 2H2+O2 

Pd
→ 2H2O19 when the 

system is purged with forming gas (N2 + 5% H2) mixture. The H2O generated during the O2 capture 

reaction is condensed in a big silica gel reservoir. We show in Figure 1(c) a comparison of the O2 

concentration evolution when the chamber is simply purged with N2 (O2 scrubber system OFF) and 

when the catalytic O2 capture is employed (O2 scrubber system ON). We found that the O2 scrubber 

speeds up the O2 concentration drop by a factor of 5 with respect to the simple N2 purge. In fact, these 

kind of gloveless anaerobic chambers with active O2 removal have proven to be very effective to 

generate environmental conditions with very low O2 levels (in the 10 ppm range).  

Figure 2 shows how the operator is preparing a Gel-Film (WF x4 6.0 mil, by Gel-Pak®) stamp with 

mechanically exfoliated black phosphorus. These pictures illustrate how the operator is able to easily 

carry out all the required delicate manual tasks (handling of tweezers, cutting, peeling, etc.) as he/she 

does  not  need  to  wear  thick  glove-box  gloves.  Briefly,  a  bulk  piece  of  black  phosphorus  (HQ 

Graphene)  is  exfoliated  using  Nitto  SPV224  tape.  The  tape  containing  the  exfoliated  black 

phosphorus flakes is gently pressed against the surface of a rectangle piece of Gel-Film substrate that 

will be used as viscoelastic stamp for the deterministic transfer.2 The stamp is secured overhanging 

in the edge of a microscope glass slide with Scotch tape (Magic tape) and the glass slide is fixed to a 

XYZ micro-manipulator stage, that will be used to move the stamp, with double side tape (Scotch 

restickable tabs). In order to identify the flake to be transferred, we place a collimated light source 

(Thorlabs quartz tungsten-halogen lamp, QTH11) under the stamp allowing us to infer the thickness 

of the flakes from its transmittance.20 Once the desired flake is located, the lamp is replaced by an 

XY-rotation stage that will be used to move the acceptor sample (also fixed to the stage with double 

side Scotch restickable tabs).  

Figure 3 shows a sequence of optical microscopy images acquired with the transfer system zoom lens 

during the deterministic placement of a black phosphorus flake onto a SiO2/Si substrate with a pre-

patterned alignment crosshair. First, the flake is aligned in the center of the crosshair markers. Then, 

the Gel-Film stamp is lowered until establishing a gentle contact between stamp and acceptor sample. 

Finally, the stamp is slowly peeled off until it is completely removed, and the flake is successfully 

transferred in the middle  of  the  crosshair.  The  possibility  to  place flakes  at  a desired location (as 

shown in Figure 3) can be further exploited to fabricate van der Waals heterostructures by stacking 

different  2D  materials  on  top  of  each  other.  Figure  4  demonstrates  the  capability  of  our  inert 

atmosphere deterministic placement system to fabricate this kind of artificial stacks of 2D materials. 

The different transfer steps to fabricate a heterostructure based on a few-layer black phosphorus (BP) 

flake sandwiched between two flakes of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are shown in Figure 4.  

In order to benchmark the potential of the gloveless anaerobic chamber to manipulate air-sensitive 

2D materials, we monitor the evolution of the black phosphorus flake (transferred in Figure 3) inside 

the  anaerobic  chamber  through  optical  microscopy  images  with  the  system’s  zoom  lens.  Black 

phosphorus is well-known for its instability under air exposure.21–23 We do not notice any change in 

the optical microscopy images after 22 days inside the chamber. On the other hand, after taking the 

flake outside the chamber, it quickly shows signs of degradation from day 3 of air exposure (see inset 

in Figure 5 with increased contrast) and it becomes severely damaged after 9 days of exposure. In 

Figure  5,  we  show  the  optical  contrast  profiles  acquired  from  the  optical  images  of  the  black 

phosphorus  sample  along  the  black  line  indicated  in  the  first  panel.  The  profiles  present  a  clear 

increase in roughness under air exposure due to the degradation, comparing with the profiles of the 

images of the flake inside the chamber. This illustrates the potential of this experimental setup for 

handling air-sensitive 2D materials. 

Furthermore, we also checked the performance of the gloveless anaerobic chamber with even more 

unstable 2D materials. We studied a compound that belongs to the metal halide perovskites family 

that is known to quickly degrade upon atmospheric exposure.24–26 The metal halide perovskites are a 

prominent  group  of  materials  in  the  solar  harvesting  research,27–29  optoelectronics30–32  and 

photovoltaics33,34 which degrade rapidly when exposed to air or light.24,35,36 In our case, the compound 

used  is  phenethylammonium  lead  iodide  (PEA2PbI4)  2D  perovskites  synthesized  according  to  the 

techniques described in References.26,37,38 The bulk crystals are exfoliated and transferred to a SiO2/Si 

substrate  inside  the  anaerobic  chamber.  Then,  the  sample  is  monitored  for  5  hours  by  acquiring 

microscope optical pictures, similar to the procedure used in the black phosphorus sample (Figure 6). 

Again,  no  apparent  change  of  the  material  is  observed  during  the  5  hours  in  inert  atmosphere. 

However, the surface of the perovskite flakes quickly showed degradation signs after just 15 minutes 

outside the chamber. In this case, we show the optical contrast of the flake to illustrate the degradation 

upon air exposure (see the Supporting Information for the analysis of the time evolution of the optical 

contrast). Given the results, we conclude that the atmosphere in the anaerobic chamber allows the 

handling of very air-sensitive 2D materials.   

In summary, we have developed a system to precisely transfer 2D materials under inert atmosphere 

and we provide all necessary technical details to allow its implementation in other laboratories. Unlike 

other  inert  atmosphere  transfer  system  used  in  the  literature  based  on  N2  or  Ar  over  pressurized 

gloveboxes, our system relies on a gloveless anaerobic chamber with an active O2 catalytic capturing 

system. Our setup allows the operator to work with his/her bare hands within the chamber, which 

facilitate tasks as scissors cutting, tape peeling, tweezer handling, etc. that are challenging to be done 

while wearing thick gloves required to access the interior of an over pressurized N2 or Ar glove-box. 

We  illustrate  the  operation  of  our  transfer  setup  by  showing  the  deterministic  transfer  of  a  black 

phosphorus flake and by studying the stability of thin black phosphorus and perovskite flakes. We 

believe that the simple operation and the low cost (<20 000 €) of this setup makes it highly attractive 

for other research groups that have not yet implemented a transfer system under inert atmosphere.

Figure  S7.  Preserving  air-sensitive  samples,  fabricated  within  the  anaerobic  chamber,  for  their  ex-situ  electrical  and 
optoelectronic  characterization.  Simple  three-terminal  electronic  devices  can  be  fabricated  by  using  the  deterministic 
transfer system to transfer a 2D material flake bridging two pre-patterned electrodes deposited on Si(p++)/SiO2. (a) After 
the transfer is finished, the substrate can be loaded in a small printed-circuit board (PCB) equipped with two spring loaded 
copper tips that will make electrical connection to the source and drain electrodes. Electrical connection to the gate can be 
done by  connecting  the  back  part  of  the  substrate  with  silver  paint  (using  the  heavily doped  silicon  substrate  as  a  gate 
electrode). (b) The PCB board can be loaded in a miniature chamber equipped with electrical connections, an optical window 
and a vacuum valve. After closing the miniature chamber, the sample is preserved in an anaerobic atmosphere. The chamber 
can be evacuated through the vacuum valve to allow electrical transport measurement at high vacuum levels (10-6 mbar).

characteristics (Vsd = 0.01 V).
