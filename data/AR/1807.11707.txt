ABSTRACT

EGB 6 is an extended, faint old planetary nebula (PN) with an enigmatic nucleus. The central star (PG 0950+139) is a hot DAOZ-type
white dwarf (WD). An unresolved, compact emission knot was discovered to be located 0′′.166 away from the WD and it was shown
to be centered around a dust-enshrouded low-luminosity star. It was argued that the dust disk and evaporated gas (photoionized by
the hot WD) around the companion are remnants of a disk formed by wind material captured from the WD progenitor when it was
an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. In this paper, we assess the hot WD to determine its atmospheric and stellar parameters.
We performed a model-atmosphere analysis of ultraviolet (UV) and optical spectra. We found Teﬀ = 105 000 ± 5000 K, log g =
7.4 ± 0.4, and a solar helium abundance (He = 0.25 ± 0.1, mass fraction). We measured the abundances of ten more species (C,
N, O, F, Si, P, S, Ar, Fe, Ni) and found essentially solar abundance values, indicating that radiation-driven wind mass-loss, with a
theoretical rate of log( ˙M/M⊙/yr) = −11.0+1.1

(PN G298.0+34.8), and found that it is a slightly cooler DAOZ WD (Teﬀ ≈ 85 000 K), but this WD shows signatures of gravitational
settling of heavy elements.

1. Introduction

EGB 6 (PN G221.5+46.3) is a faint old planetary nebula (PN)
with a mysterious nucleus. The PN was discovered by Ellis et al.
(1984) and has an angular extension of 11′ × 13′. At a nominal
distance of ≈ 725 pc, the linear diameter of the PN is ≈ 1 pc. The
central star (PG 0950+139) is a very hot white dwarf (WD) that
was independently discovered by Ellis et al. (1984) and the Palo-
mar Green (PG) survey (Green et al. 1986). Bright nebula emis-
sion lines superposed on the WD spectra were shown not to stem
from the old, low-surface brightness PN, but from a relatively
dense (ne = 2.2 × 106 cm−3, Dopita & Liebert 1989), unresolved
compact emission knot (CEK) that was thought to be centered
on the WD. An infrared excess was discovered by Zuckerman
et al. (1991) and attributed to the presence of an M-type stellar
companion. It came as a big surprise when imaging and grism
spectroscopy obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
revealed that the CEK is a point-like source at the location of
the companion, 0′′. 166 away from the WD (Liebert et al. 2013),
corresponding to a projected linear separation of ≈ 118 AU. The
origin of the material making up the CEK is unknown. It was
suggested that it is the remnant of a disk containing material
captured by the companion star from the WD progenitor’s wind

⋆ Based on observations made with the NASA-CNES-CSA Far Ultra-
violet Spectroscopic Explorer and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Tele-
scope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is oper-
ated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.,
under NASA contract NAS5-26666.

during its asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stage, and that this
disk is surrounded by gas (the CEK) photoionized by the hot
WD. The nature of the companion is in fact unknown because
it is enshrouded by dust (Bond et al. 2016). It must be a low-
luminosity object, a dM star or even another WD. For a detailed
summary of our current knowledge about this system, we re-
fer to the exhaustive paper by Bond et al. (2016) and references
therein.

In the present paper, we investigate in detail the hot central
star of EGB 6. It was classiﬁed as a hot DA white dwarf by Flem-
ing et al. (1986). Later on, by the detection of ionized helium,
Liebert et al. (1989) established the star as a DAO white dwarf,
and after the detection of metal lines in the ultraviolet (Gianninas
et al. 2010) the star was assigned to the DAOZ class.

The analysis of the optical spectrum of the WD is hampered
by strong emission lines from the CEK. Using pure-hydrogen
local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model atmospheres,
Liebert et al. (1989) derived Teﬀ = 70 000 ± 7000 K and log g =
7.5 ± 0.25 from a ﬁt to the Hγ line only. From new observations,
and with pure hydrogen non-LTE models for Balmer line ﬁts,
Liebert et al. (2005) found Teﬀ = 108 390 ± 16 687 K and log g =
7.39 ± 0.38.

Using non-LTE model atmospheres, Gianninas et al. (2010)
derived Teﬀ = 93 230 ± 20 425 K and log g = 7.36 ± 0.79, empha-
sizing increased uncertainties in the measured parameters due
to the exclusion of the Balmer line cores from the ﬁtting pro-
cedure. For the ﬁrst time, they measured the helium abundance
(He/H=0.1+0.7
−0.09, by mass) which, at face value, is lower than the

solar abundance (He/H=0.34), but highly uncertain. In their hy-
drogen plus helium models, in order to compute a more realistic
atmospheric structure, they included the elements C, N, and O in
solar amounts, as prescribed by the analysis of Werner (1996),
who outlined the solution to the Balmer line problem. This mea-
sure was motivated by the fact that they identiﬁed metal lines
in Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) spectra; how-
ever, abundance determinations were not performed.

Here, we present a new spectral analysis of the WD. Our
primary aim was to determine the metal abundances from the
ultraviolet (UV) spectra taken with FUSE and to improve the
measurement of Teﬀ , log g , and He abundance employing, in

addition, previously unused optical spectra. It was expected that
the results would contribute one piece to resolve the puzzle of
this extraordinary PN nucleus.1

It has been claimed that EGB 6 is the prototype of a
small class of PNe with central compact emission regions
(Frew & Parker 2010). Related to them could be Tol 26
(PN G298.0+34.8, Hawley 1981), whose central star was hith-
erto unexplored. From the nebula analysis, Teﬀ > 50 000 K was
concluded. Here we present the investigation of an archival UV

the ﬁctional Sherlock Holmes might be: “It is, of course, a triﬂe, but
there is nothing so important as triﬂes.” (Conan Doyle 1891).

spectrum obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)
aboard HST, to check for the possible similarity between the hot
central stars of EGB 6 and Tol 26.

2. Observations

For our analysis of EGB 6, we use UV spectra which were ob-
served with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), HST,
and FUSE. Optical spectra were obtained by the Sloan Digi-
tal Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Supernovae Type Ia Progenitor
Survey (SPY, Napiwotzki et al. 2003). For Tol 26, we used the
HST/COS spectrum.

2.1. Ultraviolet spectra

EGB 6 was observed by FUSE twice in 2000 and we retrieved
the spectra from the MAST archive. The ﬁrst observation
(A0340101) had imprecise target coordinates, so the star was
on the edge of the slit in two channels and completely missed
the other two. The second observation (A0341101) was good in
all channels, so we scaled the usable data from the ﬁrst observa-
tion to match the second. The reduction procedure was the same
as that described in Werner et al. (2016). The resulting spec-
trum is shown in Fig. 1. The resolving power is about 20 000.
We smoothed the spectrum by a 0.05 Å wide boxcar and, ac-
cordingly, our synthetic spectra were convolved with a Gaussian
with FWHM=0.07 Å.

The hydrogen Lyman lines are blended with the respective
He ii line series. From the latter, three isolated lines are visible,
with decreasing strength, at 1085 Å, 992 Å, and 959 Å (transi-
tions between levels with principal quantum numbers n = 2 →
5, 6, 7). The FUSE spectrum was published by Gianninas et al.
(2010) and photospheric lines of seven metals were identiﬁed (C,
N, O, Si, P, S, Fe); however, it was not subject to a quantitative
analysis. We identiﬁed many more lines of these elements plus
three more species (F, Ar, and Ni; see Sect. 3.2).

The FUSE observations exhibit many absorption lines of the
ISM. To unambiguously identify stellar lines, we employed the
program OWENS (Lemoine et al. 2002; Hébrard et al. 2002;

Hébrard & Moos 2003). It has the capacity to consider several,
individual ISM clouds with their own radial and turbulent veloc-
ity, temperature, chemical composition, and respective column
densities. We identiﬁed and modeled lines of H i, D i, H2 (J =
0–4), HD (J = 0), C ii–iii, C ii∗, N i–iii, O i, Si ii, P ii, S iii, Ar i,
and Fe ii.

The star was observed in 1993 with the Faint Object Spec-
trograph (FOS) aboard HST. Two spectra were taken with grat-
ings G160L (1150–2500 Å, resolution ≈ 7 Å) and G270H (2220–
3300 Å, resolution ≈ 2 Å). Because of the low resolution of the
G160L spectrum, even the strongest spectral lines predicted by
our models (He ii λ1640, C iv λ1550, N v λ1240, O v λ1371) are
not detected beyond doubt. In the G270H spectrum, three mem-
bers of the He ii Fowler series can be seen (n = 3 → 5, 6, 7).

Three observations during 1987–1989 were performed with
IUE (SWP camera, resolution 5 Å). The co-added spectrum was
taken from the database created by Holberg et al. (2003). Its ﬂux
level matches the HST/FOS data. At best, He ii λ1640 and C iv
λ1550 are barely detectable.

The UV spectra up to λ = 1770 Å are shown in Fig. 2. We
ﬁt the continuum shape with our ﬁnal photospheric model as-
suming interstellar reddening E(B − V) = 0.025 ± 0.005, in
good agreement with the value derived by Bond et al. (2016,
E(B−V) = 0.02) and conﬁrming the conclusion that the hot cen-
tral star suﬀers no reddening within the system because the total
reddening in the direction of EGB 6 is about E(B − V) = 0.027
(Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011). From the Lyman lines, we derive
an interstellar neutral hydrogen column density of log(nH/cm2)=
20.3 ± 0.4. This mainly follows from ﬁtting the Lyα proﬁle be-
cause only for this line is the equivalent width dominated by the
interstellar medium (ISM) and not by the photospheric contribu-
tion.

A HST/COS spectrum of the central star of Tol 26 was
recorded in 2014 with grating G140L. It has a useful wavelength
range of ≈ 1160–2000 Å and a spectral resolution of ≈ 0.6 Å. It
is discussed in detail in Sect. 3.4. The spectrum was smoothed
with a 0.1 Å wide boxcar and the models were folded with 0.6 Å
Gaussians.

(red: SDSS spectrum, gray: SPY spectrum; two lowest lines: HST
spectrum) compared to a model spectrum (blue graph; Teﬀ = 105 000 K,
log g = 7.4) with the adopted parameters (see Table 1). Nebular emis-
sion lines in the photospheric Balmer line cores are truncated for clarity.

2.2. Optical spectra

The archival SDSS spectrum of the EGB 6 nucleus covers the
wavelength range 3600–10 300 Å with a resolution of ≈ 2.5 Å.
The spectrum is a co-addition of four single observations. We
rectiﬁed it for our ﬁtting with normalized synthetic line proﬁles
(Fig. 3). The only photospheric lines that can be identiﬁed are
from H and He ii. The cores of the Balmer lines and He ii λ4686
(and perhaps also He ii λ5412) are contaminated with emission
lines from the CEK around the companion (Liebert et al. 2013),
hampering the determination of atmospheric parameters.

To mitigate this problem, we used SPY spectra, which have a
higher resolution (≈ 0.1 Å), allowing us to trace the photospheric
line proﬁles closer toward the line core, because the nebular
emission lines are rather narrow. However, the signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) of these spectra is relatively poor. In total, three SPY
spectra (each consisting of three segments covering the ranges
3400–4520 Å, 4620–5600 Å, and 5680–6640 Å) were used and
rectiﬁed. We abandoned co-addition because of the very diﬀer-
ent S/N of the single spectra in diﬀerent wavelength regions. In
the SPY spectra, too, no metal lines are detectable.

The He ii λ3203 line, covered by the HST/FOS G270H spec-
trum, is obviously not aﬀected by nebula emission. The evalu-
ated optical and near-UV H and He ii lines are shown in Fig. 3.

3. Spectral analysis

We used the Tübingen Model-Atmosphere Package (TMAP2)
to compute non-LTE, plane-parallel, line-blanketed atmosphere
models in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium (Werner & Drei-
zler 1999; Werner et al. 2003, 2012). The models include H, He,
C, N, O, Si, P, S, Fe, and Ni. The employed model atoms are
described in detail by Werner et al. (2018). In addition, we per-
formed line formation iterations (i.e., keeping the atmospheric
structure ﬁxed) for argon and ﬂuorine using the model atoms
presented in Werner et al. (2015).

We ﬁrst turn to the WD in EGB 6 (Sects. 3.1–3.3) and then

to the nucleus in Tol 26 (Sect. 3.4).

3.1. Effective temperature, surface gravity, He abundance

We started our spectrum ﬁtting procedure for EGB 6 from a
model with temperature, gravity, and helium abundance close
to the values derived by Gianninas et al. (2010): Teﬀ = 93 000 K,
log g = 7.4, H = 0.9 and He = 0.09 (mass fractions), and assum-
ing solar abundances for the metals. Keeping ﬁxed log g and
the H/He ratio, we then adjusted iteratively Teﬀ and the metal
abundances to achieve a good ﬁt to the metal lines in the FUSE
spectrum. From the relative strengths of lines from diﬀerent ion-
ization stages of nitrogen, oxygen, and iron (see Sect. 3.2), we
realized that the eﬀective temperature must be higher, namely
105 000 K, within a narrow margin of about 5000 K. Then the
possible range of the surface gravity was checked with the op-
tical H and He lines, conﬁrming the initial value within log g =
7.4 ± 0.4. The UV lines of H and He are compatible with this re-
sult but they are less sensitive to log g . Then the He abundance
was reﬁned by using the optical and UV spectra and we found
a better ﬁt with a higher He/H ratio, namely a solar value (H =
0.74 and He = 0.25). A model computed with log g = 8.0 shows
H and He lines that are signiﬁcantly too broad.

To investigate the eﬀects of the uncertainty in log g on the
other atmospheric parameters, we repeated the ﬁtting procedure
with log g = 7.0 models. The lower gravity leads to lower par-
ticle densities and, according to the Saha equation, metal ion-
ization balances are shifted to higher stages. To compensate for
this, Teﬀ must be reduced to retain good line ﬁts, namely down to
100 000 K. Metal abundances are hardly aﬀected by this change
in Teﬀ and log g , but the helium abundance must be reduced
in the model. Otherwise, the He ii lines become too strong, in
particular those at 959 Å, 4686 Å, and 5412 Å, and a detectable
λ4542 line is predicted that is not seen in the observations. We
arrive at He = 0.18 (and thus H = 0.81). From these experiments
we conclude Teﬀ = 105 000 ± 5000 K, log g = 7.4 ± 0.4, and He
= 0.25 ± 0.1. The error in the individual metal abundances is
estimated not to exceed ±0.5 dex.

In Fig. 3, we compare the observed optical and near-UV H
and He lines with our ﬁnal model. Although nebular emission
lines mask the Balmer line centers, we note a Balmer line prob-
lem (Napiwotzki 1993), that is, the depth of innermost parts of
the observed photospheric proﬁles of Hα and Hβ is not quite
matched by the models. Gianninas et al. (2010) were unable
to detect this problem because of the lower resolution of their
spectra. In order to ﬁt these lines, a lower temperature would

be required; however, this would give too-deep Hγ and Hδ line
cores and, as mentioned above, would be in conﬂict with the
metal line strengths. The central emission in He ii λ4686 is of
nebular origin because its height is not reached by the emission
reversal of the photospheric line proﬁle.

Comparing our results with the most recent ones by Gian-
ninas et al. (2010, see Sect. 1), the main progress we achieved
is the rather tight constraint of the eﬀective temperature (±5 %
compared to ±22 %) by using ionization balances of metals. In
addition, the error in the surface gravity could be reduced from
about ±0.8 dex to ±0.4 dex. The same holds for the He/H abun-
dance ratio. As a consequence, stellar parameters can be deter-
mined with higher precision (Sect. 3.3).

3.2. Metal abundances

We detected lines from ten metals in the FUSE spectrum (Figs. 1
and 4). These lines are well known from previous analyses. Line
lists, from which detailed laboratory wavelengths and transitions
can be obtained, were presented by Werner et al. (2015, their
Tables 2–5) and Werner et al. (2017, their Tables 2 and 3). The
derived abundances are listed in Table 1 and displayed in Fig. 5.
From carbon, two C iv doublets are seen in the FUSE spec-
trum, namely the 3p–4d and 3d–4f transitions at 1108 Å and
1169 Å, respectively. In our ﬁnal model with C = 0.003, the line
cores are not deep enough to match the observation. A detailed
inspection shows that the computed line proﬁles show central
emission cores. This is unrealistic, but despite some numeri-
cal testing concerning the temperature structure of the model,
the reason remains unknown. Increasing the carbon abundance
mitigates the problem in the line cores, but leads to too strong
line wings and to the appearance of optical C iv lines, which

are not observed. The variations in log g , Teﬀ , and He abun-
dance described in Sect. 3.1 do not improve the C iv line ﬁts.
The same problem was encountered in our analysis of a hot
DO WD with similar temperature and gravity (PG 1034+001,
115 000/7.0; Werner et al. 2017, their Fig. 1). The star is too hot
to show the C iii multiplet at 1175 Å, which is often seen in other
DAO WDs and in Tol 26 (see Sect. 3.4).

Nitrogen displays the N iv multiplet at 922–924 Å and the
singlet at 955 Å. We also see two N v doublets at 1048 Å and
1050 Å, which are partially blended by interstellar lines. The
relative strength of the N iv and N v lines is well matched by our
ﬁnal model. Values of Teﬀ as high as 115 000 K (at log g = 7.4)
or as low as 95 000 K (at log g = 7.0) can be strictly excluded
because the N iv lines are much too weak or too strong, respec-
tively, while the N v line strengths are almost unaﬀected by the
Teﬀ variations.

Prominent oxygen lines from three ionization stages are de-
tected. The O iv/O v line strength ratio is very sensitive against
Teﬀ variations. While the O v lines hardly change within a range
of 95 000–110 000 K, the O iv lines quickly disappear with in-
creasing Teﬀ . The O vi λλ1032/1038 resonance doublet poses
a problem. At the adopted abundance, the innermost line cores
are too deep and the line wings are slightly too shallow. Interest-
ingly, however, two subordinate O vi lines (4d–5f and 4f–5g tran-
sitions at 1123 Å and 1125 Å) are reproduced well by our ﬁnal
model. They are too weak in the Teﬀ = 95 000 K model (log g =
7.0) and too strong in the Teﬀ = 115 000 K model (log g = 7.4).
A weak F vi λ1139.50 line can be detected, allowing for a
ﬂuorine abundance measurement. The silicon abundance was
derived from a ﬁt to the Si iv λλ1122/1128 doublet. The blue
component is blended by one of the mentioned relatively broad
photospheric O vi lines. Another strong Si iv doublet at 1067 Å is
blended by a strong interstellar line. The phosphorus abundance
was derived from the P v λλ1118/1128 resonance doublet. The
sulfur abundance was found from the S vi λλ933/945 resonance
doublet, and from two weaker subordinate S vi lines at 1000 Å
and 1118 Å. The argon abundance was measured from the rather
prominent Ar vii λ1063.55 line, which is blended by the wing of
an adjacent interstellar line.

The strongest iron lines stem from Fe vii, followed by Fe vi
and Fe viii lines (the only unblended Fe viii line is at 1148 Å).
The relative strengths of lines from the diﬀerent ionization stages
are sensitive temperature indicators. For example, at Teﬀ =
95 000 K (and log g = 7.0) the Fe vii lines become too weak,
while the Fe vi lines become too strong. At Teﬀ = 115 000 K (and
log g = 7.4) the Fe vi lines are too weak, while the Fe viii lines
are too strong. The nickel abundance is derived from a multitude
of relatively weak Ni vi lines.

Fig. 6. HST/COS spectrum of the white dwarf in Tol 26 (gray) compared to a photospheric model spectrum (red; Teﬀ = 85 000 K, log g = 7.4)
with abundances as given in Sect. 3.4. The blue graph is the photospheric model attenuated by interstellar lines. Prominent photospheric lines are
identiﬁed. Absorption proﬁles of the C iv resonance doublet and He ii λ1640 Å (except for the far wings) are masked by nebular emission lines.

Other iron group elements were not detected, and we
can thus exclude extreme overabundances that were seen in
other DAOs, namely HS 2115+1148 (Werner et al. 2018) and
BD−22◦3467, the exciting star of Abell 35 (Ziegler et al. 2012).
Likewise, we found no hint of trans-iron group elements that are
present in strongly oversolar amounts in several hot DO WDs
(Hoyer et al. 2018, and references therein).

To summarize, the abundances of hydrogen, helium, and ten
more identiﬁed species in the white dwarf are, within error lim-
its, compatible with solar values.

Notes. (a) Mass, radius, luminosity, post-AGB age tevol, and mass-loss
rate ˙M from evolutionary tracks by Miller Bertolami (2016). Abun-
dances are given in number ratios relative to hydrogen (column 2), in
mass fractions (column 3), and logarithmic mass fractions relative to
solar value (column 4; solar abundances from Asplund et al. 2009). Er-
ror limits for the abundances are ±0.5 dex for the metals and ±0.4 dex
for helium.

For our WD we have V = 15.998 (Bond et al. 2016). From
E(B − V) = 0.025 we derived the visual extinction using the
standard relation AV = 3.1E(B − V) = 0.077, hence V0 = 15.92.
We found d = 660+1100
−400 pc. This value is about 15% higher than
the spectroscopic distance derived by Liebert et al. (2013), which
essentially reﬂects the ratio of the eﬀective temperatures of the
atmospheric model they used (93 235 K) and that of our model
(105 000 K). It agrees with the value of d = 870 ± 250 pc de-
rived by Frew et al. (2016) with a newly developed statistical
distance indicator for PNe. The distance to the WD given in the
Gaia Data Release 2 (1.36+0.40
−0.25 kpc) is a factor of two larger than
our result, but in agreement within error limits. We conjecture
that the Gaia parallax measurement may be compromised by the
strong emission lines from the nearby CEK, which could be vari-
able in strength, as was discussed in detail by Bond et al. (2016).

at 1175 Å are detectable. The C iv doublet might be ﬁlled in
partially by an He i λ1168.67 airglow line (second order from
λ584.33). The photospheric C iv resonance doublet is com-
pletely ﬁlled in by nebular emission. We note a photospheric
N v resonance doublet, but a potential photospheric N iv λ1718
line is masked by a tenuous emission feature. We see a O iv mul-
tiplet at 1340 Å and O v λ1371. Their relative strengths can be
used to constrain the eﬀective temperature. We identify a num-
ber of Fe v lines, mostly in the 1374–1430 Å region.

To ﬁt the spectrum, we started to use models with the com-
position and surface gravity we adopted for EGB 6. We adjusted
Teﬀ by using the relative O iv/O v line strengths. The best ﬁt is
obtained at Teﬀ = 85 000 ± 5000 K. At that temperature, the C iii
λ1175 multiplet (which is not present in EGB 6 because of its
higher Teﬀ ) also ﬁts well. In addition, the Fe v line features are
reproduced, so that the C and Fe abundances are the same as
in EGB 6. However, we had to reduce the nitrogen and oxygen
abundances. We found N = 5 × 10−6 and O = 1.5 × 10−3, i.e., 40
and ≈ 3 times less than in EGB 6. Error limits for abundances
are estimated to 0.5 dex. All other metal abundances cannot
be assessed with the HST spectrum. The Si iv resonance dou-
blet is obviously perturbed by interstellar absorption because the
line depths cannot be matched by a photospheric model even
with an unrealistically high Si abundance. The helium abun-
dance and surface gravity could in principle be constrained with
He ii λ1640, but both quantities cannot be derived independently
given that we only see the outermost part of the line wings. To
check to what extent these uncertainties aﬀect the determination
of the other atmospheric parameters (Teﬀ , abundances of C, N,
O, Fe), we computed models varying log g (±0.4 dex) and the
He abundance (reduction from solar to 1/8 solar) and we found
that our results do not change within error limits, in particular,
the N and O deﬁciencies remain.

Given the uncertainty in the He abundance, the question
arises whether Tol 26 is a DAOZ at all. Could it be a He-
dominated white dwarf (i.e., spectral type DOAZ) or even com-
pletely devoid of hydrogen (spectral type DOZ)? Probably not.
When we remove hydrogen from our model, the He ii λ1640
wings become so strong and broad that it is not compatible

with the observation, unless the surface gravity is reduced be-
low log g = 7 in order to diminish the strength of the line wings.

4. Summary and discussion

4.1. EGB6

We performed a spectral analysis of the hot WD in the PN
EGB 6. The eﬀective temperature could be tightly constrained,
while the surface gravity remains relatively uncertain (Teﬀ =
105 000 ± 5000 K, log g = 7.4 ± 0.4). A mass of M/M⊙ =
0.58+0.12
−0.04 was derived. The abundances of H, He, and ten more
species are solar.

We conclude that element diﬀusion by gravitational settling
and radiative levitation is not acting in the photosphere. The
probable reason is that the relatively luminous star (≈ 100 L⊙)
is losing mass by a radiation-driven wind at a rate on the or-
der of 10−11 M⊙/yr. Compared to other DAOZ WDs, this is re-
markable because they usually show strong deviations from so-
lar abundance patterns due to diﬀusion (e.g., Good et al. 2005;
Ziegler et al. 2012; Werner et al. 2018). The sample of DAOZs
and related hot progenitors analyzed by Ziegler (2012) contains
objects with temperature and gravity similar to EGB 6. In par-
ticular, the central star of Abell 31 (Teﬀ = 114 000 ± 10 000 K,
log g = 7.4 ± 0.3) has a roughly solar abundance pattern, while
slightly cooler objects like the central star of Abell 35 (Teﬀ =
80 000 ± 10 000 K, log g = 7.2 ± 0.3) show extreme deviations
from it (Ziegler et al. 2012). Obviously, stellar winds in cooling
DAO WDs eﬀectively prevent element diﬀusion as long as Teﬀ
is higher than ≈ 100 000 K. Our result for Tol 26 (Teﬀ ≈ 85 000 K;
O and N depletion) conﬁrms this conclusion. Similarly, the cor-
relation between helium abundance and eﬀective temperature
found by Gianninas et al. (2010) in their sample of DAOs was
interpreted as an indication of how the weakening stellar wind
along the WD cooling sequence can no longer maintain helium
in the atmosphere of a white dwarf.

rate

The

theoretical mass-loss

from the hot WD,
log( ˙M/M⊙/yr) = −11.0+1.1
is orders of magnitudes larger
−0.8,
than required to inhibit Bondi–Hoyle accretion of interstellar
material (MacDonald 1992). We therefore do not expect that
any circumstellar material from the PN is accreted unless
the accretion ﬂow is reorganized into a disk, due to angular
momentum.

Concerning the outer nebula, Liebert et al. (1989) pointed
out a discrepancy between their estimations of the post-AGB
age of the WD (several 105 yr; based on their spectral analysis
and evolutionary tracks by Koester & Schönberner 1986) and the
kinematical age of the nebula (20–50 kyr, based on their derived
spectroscopic distance of 460 pc and assuming a PN expansion
rate of 20–50 km/s). Our results indicate a much younger WD
age, log(tevol/yr = 3.60+1.26
−0.09), mainly due to the higher eﬀective
temperature (105 000 K compared to 70 000 K). Taking the PN
angular extension (13′), the spectroscopic distance derived by
us (660 pc), and the expansion velocity (38 km/s, Hippelein &
Weinberger 1990), we obtain a kinematical age of 15 kyr, which
is in agreement with the post-AGB age of the WD.

If the material around the companion was captured at the PN
ejection 15 kyr ago, and if the disk lifetime is not much longer,
then this would explain why the EGB 6 phenomenon is uncom-
mon. Also, the large distance of the companion from the primary
(at least ≈ 100 AU) prevents a fast evaporation of the disk mate-
rial by UV radiation from the primary. Measured orbital periods
of binary central stars are all much shorter (from hours up to

Article number, page 8 of 9

≈ 10 yr; see, e.g., the compilation maintained by D. Jones3) than
that of EGB 6 (larger than ≈ 500 yr); however a number of wide,
visual binaries are known as well (separations of ≈ 100 to a few
thousand AU, Ciardullo et al. 1999).

Liebert et al. (2013) considered an alternative explanation for
the origin of the compact emission knot. They put forward the
idea that it is the region where the winds from the WD and the
supposed dM companion collide. Their “duelling-winds” model
was considered unlikely by Bond et al. (2016) since they discov-
ered that the companion is not an exposed dM star but a dust-
enshrouded low-luminosity star. In view of our result that the
WD is rather young and luminous, it might be worth reconsider-
ing the colliding-wind hypothesis. From an ionization model for
the CEK, Liebert et al. (2013) estimated that a WD wind with
a rather high mass-loss rate on the order of 10−9 M⊙/yr would
be required, but they questioned how a hydrogen-rich WD could
maintain such a high rate.

We have shown that the WD has a solar metallicity; there-
fore, a radiation-driven wind can be sustained with a mass-loss
rate of up to 10−10 M⊙/yr, and thus almost reaches the required
value. However, we also point out that there is no spectroscopic
hint of mass-loss; in particular, we would expect the O vi res-
onance doublet to be most susceptible to wind eﬀects, but the
line centers are not shifted relative to other photospheric lines
and the proﬁles are symmetric. Investigations of H-rich central
stars showed that the rates are usually larger than 10−9 M⊙/yr.
The lowest rate derived so far, and thus constraining the thresh-
old for the spectroscopic proof of existing winds, is that of
NGC 1360 with ≈ 10−10 M⊙/yr (Herald & Bianchi 2011) us-
ing very weak deviations of the O vi resonance doublet line pro-
ﬁles from hydrostatic-atmosphere proﬁles. Detailed expanding
model-atmosphere computations tailored to EGB 6 are required
to determine the mass-loss rate that would be necessary to leave
a detectable spectroscopic signature.

4.2. Tol26

We analyzed a UV spectrum of Tol 26. We found, as for
EGB 6, that the hot nucleus of Tol 26 is a DAOZ WD, but cooler
(Teﬀ ≈ 85 000 K). Helium abundance and surface gravity are un-
certain with the observations currently at hand. We measured
the abundances of C, N, O, and Fe. Signiﬁcant depletion of ni-
trogen and oxygen was revealed, which can be interpreted as
an indication that the gravitational settling of elements aﬀects
the abundance pattern in the photosphere, in contrast to the WD
in EGB 6. Our results conﬁrm that, with regard to the hot nu-
cleus and the compact nebula emission region, Tol 26 is similar
to EGB 6. It remains to be investigated whether the central star
of Tol 26 also has a low-luminosity companion.
