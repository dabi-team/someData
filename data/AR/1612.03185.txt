The variable star AR Sco was recently discovered to pulse in brightness every
1.97 min from ultraviolet wavelengths into the radio regime. The system is
composed of a cool, low-mass star in a tight, 3.55 hr orbit with a more mas-
sive white dwarf. Here we report new optical observations of AR Sco that
show strong linear polarization (up to 40%) which varies strongly and peri-
odically on both the spin period of the white dwarf and the beat period be-
tween the spin and orbital period, as well as low level (< a few %) circular
polarization. These observations support the notion that, similar to neutron
star pulsars, the pulsed luminosity of AR Sco is powered by the spin-down of
the rapidly-rotating white dwarf which is highly magnetised (up to 500 MG).
The morphology of the modulated linear polarization is similar to that seen in
the Crab pulsar, albeit with a more complex waveform owing to the presence
of two periodic signals of similar frequency. Magnetic interactions between
the two component stars, coupled with synchrotron radiation from the white
dwarf, power the observed polarized and non-polarized emission. AR Scorpii
is therefore the ﬁrst example of a white dwarf pulsar.

Background

Radio pulsars, discovered nearly 50 years ago, are fast rotating magnetised neutron stars with
spin-modulated synchrotron radio emission, powered by spin-down energy loss of fast ro-

tating neutron stars (1). The star AR Scorpii was recently discovered to be a 3.56 h close
binary, containing a fast rotating (117 s) white dwarf, showing strong brightness variations
across most of the electromagnetic spectrum (ultraviolet to radio), most strongly modulated on
the 118.2 s beat (synodic) period, and its harmonics (2). The spin-down of the white dwarf
( ˙P = 3.92 × 10−13 s s−1) powers non-thermal emission, whose luminosity far exceeds (by a
factor of ≥14; 2) the combined luminosity of the stellar components and dominates the spectral
energy distribution. These observations were explained in terms of beamed synchrotron radia-
tion from the white dwarf, some of which is reprocessed by the companion star (2). The weak
X-ray emission suggests that little accretion power is produced in AR Sco, which either implies
that it is currently in a propeller mass ejection phase or there is no mass transfer at all. If the
former, then it would be similar to the white dwarf in the cataclysmic variable AE Aquarii (3, 4,
5, 6), which has a 33 s spin period (s) and a ˙P = 5.6 × 10−14 s s−1. However, the lack of ﬂicker-
ing and broad emission lines in AR Sco, indicative of mass outﬂows which are seen in AE Aqr,
implies no mass loss and suggests that a different mechanism is draining the rotational kinetic
energy from the rapidly rotating white dwarf in AR Sco, perhaps similar to that operating in
pulsars, namely dipole radiation (e.g. 4) and MHD interactions.

Results

We present and explain the ﬁrst polarimetric study of AR Sco, which shows strong pulsed lin-
ear polarization (up to 40%), highly modulated on the spin and beat periods, and little circular
polarization (a few percent at most). We develop a model which interprets the modulated po-
larized emission, as well as the earlier observations (2) of the unpolarized emission, in terms of
synchrotron radiation produced at two separate sites: the magnetosphere of the magnetic white
dwarf, and interaction regions involving the magnetosphere of the M-star. The combined syn-
chrotron emission from these sites produces the pulsed emission seen at both the spin and beat
periods, as well as producing a synchrotron dominated SED.

Photopolarimetry

High speed all-Stokes optical polarimetry of AR Sco was obtained using the HIPPO polarimeter
(7) on the SAAO 1.9 m telescope on two consecutive nights in March 2016 in two broad spectral
bands (see Methods: Data sources). These observations revealed the system to be strongly
linearly polarized, reaching levels of 40%. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, where the ﬂux
and polarization variations in the broad red band on the ﬁrst night are presented. We also show
additional observations and variations of the Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, V) on both nights in
the Methods section. Obvious are the strongly modulated total intensity variations, found from
a period analysis discussed below, to be predominantly at the beat period and its harmonics, as
previously reported (2). The degree of linear polarization, p, shows pulse fractions up to 90%,
while the position angle is seen to rotate through ∼ 180◦ at the frequency of the ﬁrst harmonic

2

of the spin or beat frequency. In contrast, the level of circular polarization is comparatively low,
at a few percent, with variations in V that are sometimes seen to be correlated with the Q, U
variations, when they are most strongly modulated.

Periodicities

The data were subjected to a period analysis (see Methods) and the power spectra for the Stokes
Q and U parameters are presented in Figure 2. We see power at both the spin (ω) and beat (ω−Ω)
frequencies (where ω and Ω are the spin and orbital frequencies, respectively). These results
show that, as expected for a dipolar white dwarf magnetic ﬁeld, the modulation is strongest
at the ﬁrst harmonic of the spin period, namely 58.55 s, implying that polarized emission is
seen from both magnetic poles. These results can be explained by the white dwarf magnetic
ﬁeld producing a magnetically-conﬁned bipolar outﬂow of charged particles emitting strong
linearly polarized synchrotron radiation which, together with the magnetic ﬁeld of the white
dwarf, sweeps across our line of sight and across the inner face of the M-star companion, where
it leads to unpolarized reprocessed optical emission.

Spin modulated polarization

The spin phase-folded polarimetry is shown in Figure 3, which clearly shows the double-peaked
variations of the polarized intensity, and particularly the strongly modulated (∼90% pulse frac-
tion) linear polarization, together with the large swing in position angle through 180◦, a likely
consequence of viewing the dipole perpendicular to its axis. The folded data are different on
the two nights, with a much higher percentage polarization and a higher pulse fraction seen on
the ﬁrst night. The different nature of the spin modulations on the two nights maybe due to the
different orbital phases of the two observations, which were at φorb ∼ 0.15 and φorb ∼ 0.64,
respectively, though further observations over a number of orbital cycles will be needed to con-
ﬁrm this. Both the spin and beat modulations combine differently on the two nights, resulting
in the variability of the waveforms for the phase-folded variations. Extracting the two pure spin
and beat and signals, as a function of orbital phase, will require more extensive observations.
Likewise for discriminating between repeatable orbital modulations and stochastic effects.

In Figure 4 we plot the average Q and U data pairs over a white dwarf spin cycle and draw
the trajectories of their motion in the Q−U plane, which follow counter-clockwise loops and
demonstrate how they vary as the magnetic orientation changes. On the ﬁrst night (φorb ∼
0.15), the main peak maps to the outer circle and the secondary peak maps to the lower half
of the small loop inside it. For the observation on the second night (φorb ∼ 0.65), there is
an apparent phase change and more complex polarized ﬂux variations, leading to a different
trajectory in the Q−U plane, possibly indicative of a variation in the magnetic ﬁeld orientation
over the two nights due to orbital modulation.

These Q and U variations are qualitatively similar to that seen in the optical polarimetry of
the Crab pulsar (8), although the latter’s p and θ variations show rather different morphologies,

3

with more abrupt θ “swings” than we see for AR Sco in our lower resolution data. While the
polarized ﬂux was not shown for the Crab in this study, the duty cycle of the light curve for
the Crab is ∼ 30% (for a normalized intensity ≥0.1), much less that the minimum duty cycle
of ∼ 60% seen for the polarized and total UV ﬂux (2) in AR Sco. Also, there are a range
of different θ swing morphologies observed in radio pulsars (9), which have been interpreted
in terms of a rotating vector model (RVM; 10), where the linear polarization vector (p, θ)
represents a projection of the magnetic ﬁeld where the polarized radiation is produced on the
plane of the sky.
In this model the emission is conﬁned to the magnetic poles, where the
ﬁeld lines of the dipole are essentially parallel to each other, with a small opening angle. The
morphologies of Q–U “loop diagrams” have been used to model other magnetic systems, for
example the oblique rotator model as applied to the polarized Zeeman spectra of magnetic Ap
stars (11).

The polarization behaviour of AR Sco is quite different from the other polarized asyn-
chronous magnetic white dwarf binaries, namely intermediate polars (IPs) which, unlike AR
Sco, are accretion luminosity dominated systems, with signiﬁcant X-ray emission. In the nine
IPs where polarization has been measured, it is typically only at the few percent level (12, 13),
and is predominantly circularly polarized, as expected from cyclotron emission from an ac-
creting magnetic white dwarf. The high level of linear polarization and lower level of circular
polarization is consistent with synchrotron emission, where a maximum value for the latter of
∼ 15% is expected (14).

Constraining the white dwarf magnetic ﬁeld

The lack of the usual signatures for accretion, namely ﬂickering and strong, broad and vari-
able Doppler broadened emission lines, coupled with the relatively low X-ray luminosity of
∼ 5 × 1030 erg s−1 (2), some two orders of magnitude less than a typical accreting magnetic
white dwarf, is evidence that the white dwarf in AR Sco is currently not accreting, or has a very
low accretion rate. The ratio of X-ray to spin-powered luminosity (α = 3.3 × 10−3; see Meth-
ods: Luminosities) indicates that the white dwarf in AR Sco is currently behaving as a rotation
powered pulsar, similar to AE Aqr (4; and Supplementary Figure 8). Most of the luminosity of
the system is being driven by rotational kinetic energy losses. The bulk of the spin-down power
is expected to be lost by a combination of magnetic dipole radiation (see Methods: Magnetic
dipole radiation and (4; and references therein), as well as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) in-
teractions of the fast rotating white dwarf’s magnetic ﬁeld with the secondary star. Additional
losses may also come from an out-ﬂow of relativistic charged particles from the magnetic white
dwarf and a wind from the M-star companion.

The upper limit on the magnetic dipole strength can be derived assuming that the bulk of the
spin-down power is radiated by dipole radiation (Poynting radiation; see Methods: Magnetic
dipole radiation). So if Lm−d = L ˙νs, the upper limit placed on the white dwarf magnetic ﬁeld

for a maximum dipole tilt angle to the spin axis of χ = 90◦, is given as

(1)

This value is in the regime for high ﬁeld magnetic white dwarfs, either isolated or in magnetic
cataclysmic variables (15).

Another approach, assuming that a fraction of the spin-down power is dissipated through a
magnetic stand-off shock near the secondary, gave an estimate of the magnetic ﬁeld of ∼100
MG (16). If rotational energy is also dissipated through magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) pump-
ing of the secondary star, then a constraint can be placed by estimating the MHD power dis-
sipated in the surface layers of the secondary (17). Dissipation will occur through magnetic
reconnection and Ohmic heating, particularly in that part of the secondary star’s photosphere
which faces the white dwarf. This could contribute to both the observed line emission and the
strong orbital photometric modulation, which is at maximum (after removal of the spin pulsa-
tions at φorb ∼ 0.5 (2), when the secondary star is at superior conjunction.

MHD pumping of the secondary allows setting an independent constraint on the white dwarf
surface magnetic ﬁeld strength.
If the white dwarf magnetic ﬁeld lines sweep periodically
across the secondary star, the penetration depth of the magnetic ﬂux into the surface layers
is (see e.g. 17 and references therein) δ =
2ηtur/ωb (Methods: Spin-down torque), where
ηtur and ωb are the turbulent diffusivity and beat (synodic) angular frequency, respectively. For
the photospheric conditions of a M-type dwarf, δ ∼ 108 cm, i.e. using ηtur ≤ 1015 cm2s−1
(17). The power dissipation of magnetic energy through reconnection and Ohmic heating can
be estimated from Pmhd = (B2/8π)(4πR2

2δ) ωb (e.g. 17 and references therein).

(cid:113)

For a 500 MG magnetic white dwarf, the ﬁeld strength at the distance of the secondary (at
a distance of a = 8 × 1010 cm; see Methods: Binary parameters) will be 160 G. This implies
Pmhd = 4 × 1031 erg s−1, which is ∼ 30% of the average optical luminosity of AR Sco in excess
of the combined stellar contributions, namely L+ = 1.3 × 1032 erg s−1 (2). The equation for
power dissipation through MHD pumping can then be expressed as:

(3)

where it was assumed that the secondary star ﬁlls, or nearly ﬁlls, its Roche lobe, so equals RL,2
(Methods: Binary parameters). If other processes are also responsible for the line emission
and heating of the secondary, for example beamed synchrotron radiation, dipole radiation or
charged particles, all from the white dwarf, then this will lower Pmhd and hence the estimate of
B and B1,∗ based on MHD interactions alone.

The white dwarf pulsar

We propose that the highly asynchronous binary system AR Sco contains a strongly magnetic
white dwarf, probably having been spun-up to the current short rotation period (Ps= 117 s) by
accretion torques during a high mass transfer phase in its history, as has also been proposed for
AE Aqr (e.g. 4,5,6). The observed ratios of X-ray to spin-power luminosities for AR Sco and
AE Aqr (2,4) are very similar to spin-powered neutron star pulsars (e.g. 18; and Supplementary
Figure 8), making both of them analogous to spun-up radio pulsars (4, 19). Similarly, consider-
ing that the 70% pulse fraction of the luminosity in excess of the combined stellar components
(2) is predominantly optical synchrotron emission, this implies that the synchrotron power in
AR Sco is 0.06Ps−d, similar to the ratio of synchrotron produced gamma-ray emission to spin-
down power reported recently for a sample of spun-up gamma-ray emitting milli-second radio
pulsars (20).

The high level of linear polarization in AR Sco is consistent with synchrotron emission of
relativistic electrons in ordered magnetic ﬁelds (e.g. 14). The periodicities, at both the white
dwarf spin and the beat periods, are also consistent with this emission being produced in the
white dwarf magnetosphere, which is additionally modulated at the binary period.

The spectral energy distribution (SED) in AR Sco (2, 21) shows a Sν ∝ να1 (α1 ∼ 1.3)
self-absorbed power law spectral distribution for ν ≤ 1012 − 1013 Hz, i.e. at infrared to radio
wavelengths. We suggest that these originate from pumped coronal loops of the nearly Roche
lobe-ﬁlling secondary star (e.g. 22,23, 24). The magnetospheric ﬂux tubes of the secondary star
are distorted by the fast rotating white dwarf dipolar ﬁeld (see Methods: Magnetic interactions),
inducing strong ﬁeld-aligned potentials (e.g. 25, 26), resulting in synchrotron ﬂares through the
van der Laan process (5, 27, 28), whose superposition produces the observed power law at
ν ≤ 1012 Hz and the peak emission at νcrit ∼ 0.3νsyn ≤ 1013 Hz. This emission is expected to
be pulsed at the beat frequency, consistent with the ATCA observations at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz (2),
and may be linearly and/or circularly polarized, depending on the orientation of the ﬂux tubes
relative to the observer.

At higher frequencies, ν ≥ few × 1014 Hz (optical-UV-X-rays), the SED follows a different
να2 power law (2), clearly distinguishable from the spectral components of both the M5 sec-
ondary and the white dwarf, where α2 ∼ −0.2 (also see 21). This component is produced by
non-thermal synchrotron emission from the magnetic white dwarf dipole and shows a high level
of linear polarization.

The absence of accretion, and hence conducting plasma, allows for the induction of signiﬁ-
cant electrical potentials (29) of the order of ∆V ∼ 1012 V in the vicinity of the light cylinder,
rl−c ∼ 6 × 1011 (ωwd/0.054 rad s−1) cm, where the white dwarf magnetic ﬁeld is of the or-
der Bl−c ∼ 0.4 G, which is ∼ 7.5× greater than the orbital separation (see Methods: Binary
parameters). This electric ﬁeld can produce a relativistic wind of electrons (and ions), with
energies of the order of γe ∼ 106, which will emit synchrotron radiation at frequencies up to
νsyn ≤ 3 × 1017(Bl−c/0.4 G)(γe/106)2 Hz (soft X-rays) in the vicinity of the light cylinder ra-
dius. Since the whole binary system is inside the accelerator zone, i.e. the light cylinder radius

6

(see Methods: Binary parameters), this emission may be modulated at both the spin and beat
periods.

If the white dwarf is an oblique rotator, with the magnetic dipole tilted to the spin axis, the
rotating magnetosphere is expected to produce a relativistic outﬂowing MHD wind outside the
light cylinder, with alternating regions of opposite polarity, i.e. a “striped” wind (see e.g. 30,
31, 32; Methods: Pulsar-like particle acceleration), resulting in additional particle acceleration
through magnetic reconnection and associated pulsed incoherent polarized synchrotron emis-
sion (30, 31). The emission will be pulsed at the spin period (fundamental and ﬁrst harmonic,
arising from both magnetic poles), as well as displaying the 180◦ swing of the position angle of
the polarization (see e.g. 32 for a discussion). The binary motion of the system may also impart
a beat period modulation, seen in both the polarized and unpolarized optical emission.

Discussion

The high degree of asynchronism in AR Sco (Ps/Porb = 0.009) indicates a previous spin-up
phase of the white dwarf, due to a higher mass transfer rate, similar to other highly asynchronous
intermediate polar magnetic cataclysmic variables, like AE Aqr, DQ Her, XY Ari and GK Per
(see e.g. 33). However, these system are still undergoing mass transfer but are now likely to be
in, or close, to spin equilibrium. For AE Aqr it has been shown (34, 35) that during a high mass
transfer phase the secondary star may have shed its outer envelope in a catastrophic run-away
mass transfer process, resulting in the white dwarf being spun-up to a period close to its current
value of ∼ 33s. There is currently no observational evidence that AR Sco has evolved through
such an extreme high mass transfer phase and so the evolutionary path which AR Sco took to
its current conﬁguration is still therefore an open question.

Given the high magnetic ﬁelds we are estimating, AR Sco presents a signiﬁcant problem
when it comes to spinning up the white dwarf in the ﬁrst place, since material will tend to be
ejected rather than accreted, except at very high accretion rates. Since the observed white dwarf
spin-down timescale of ∼ 107 yr (2) is less than the spin-orbit synchronization timescale of
∼ 2.5×108 yr, calculated for MHD torques alone (Methods: Spin-down torque), this implies the
bulk of the spin-down power is dissipated through magnetic dipole radiation and other channels.
The high value of the magnetic ﬁeld is therefore the reason for the current large spin down rate,
through the various mechanisms (e.g. dipole radiation, MHD interactions) we have described
here, which rob the white dwarf of its angular momentum.

The strongly pulsed polarized optical emission in AR Sco is analogous to that observed
in pulsars, like the Crab. The ratio α = (Lx/Ls−d) ∼ 10−3 derived for AR Sco implies that
most of the luminosity of the system is not produced by accretion of matter, but by spin-down
energy loss, implying that the white dwarf behaves like a spin-down powered pulsar (Supple-
mentary Figure 8). Electric potentials of the order ∆V ∼ 1012 V can be induced between the
white dwarf and the light cylinder (Methods: Magnetic ﬁeld interactions), accelerating particles
to energies of the order of γe ∼ 106 (Methods: Pulsar-like particle acceleration), resulting in

7

pulsed and strongly polarized synchrotron emission, possibly up to to X-ray frequencies. How-
ever, we argue that a striped relativistic magnetohydrodynamic wind, outside the light cylinder,
may also be present (Methods:Pulsar-like particle acceleration). The pulsed emission below
optical frequencies (i.e. radio) arises from synchrotron emission in pumped coronal loops of
the secondary star, which is consistent with the observed SED (2, 21). Future observations, par-
ticularly at X-ray and radio wavelengths, will be important in determining the exact nature of
the emission mechanisms operating in AR Sco. More extensive time resolved polarimetry will
also help to disentangle the two closely spaced polarized signals, at the spin and beat period,
leading to more deﬁnitive conclusions regarding geometry.

Methods

Data Sources:
The data presented in this paper arise from observations taken at the South African Astronom-
ical Observatory using the 1.9 m telescope. High speed photopolarimetry of AR Sco was con-
ducted utilizing the HIPPO photopolarimeter on two consecutive nights, on 14 and 15 March
2016 (see Supplementary Table 1 for observing log). HIPPO is a two-channel all-Stokes photon
counting photopolarimeter (7) which records all observations as intensity measurements every
millisecond. Rotating half and quarter waveplates modulate the signal at 10 Hz, and the data
are accumulated in 100 bins per waveplate rotation. The Stokes parameters are then determined
by a Fourier decomposition of the modulated signal; the 4θ and 8θ terms determining Q and
U and the 6θ term determining V (N.B. θ here should not be confused with the position angle
of linear polarization). The total intensity (Stokes I) data were post-processed by summing the
millisecond measurements to a time resolution of 1 s. Likewise, the 100 millisecond polariza-
tion arrays were summed to a time resolution of 10 s. Calibration observations of the polarized
standard star HD160529 (36) were observed on both nights to determine the zero points for
both waveplate angles. In addition, an observation was made of a nearby star, ∼40 arcsec north
east of AR Sco in order to estimate the level of background polarization.

Simultaneous observations were undertaken in two broad wavebands deﬁned by the convo-
lution of the intrinsic response of the GaAs photomultipliers with the respective ﬁlters used. For
both observations we used a clear fused silica ﬁlter (essentially no ﬁlter) and a Schott OG 570
glass ﬁlter, respectively, for the two channels. Channel 1 had a bandpass of 350−900 nm, while
channel 2 covered 570−900 nm. All of the data were converted to Barycentric Julian Date us-
ing the accurate prescription presented in (37). In Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 we show the
variation of the Stokes parameters I, Q, U & V for the broad band ﬁlter on both nights, while in
Supplementary Figures 3 to 6 we show the polarized ﬂux (s), degree of linear polarization (p)
and position angle (θ) for both night and both ﬁlters.

Period analysis:
The reduced HIPPO photopolarimetry was analysed using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
periodogram program. The two consecutive nights of data (14 and 15 March) were combined
and power spectra derived for i) the Stokes Q and U parameters (Figure 2), ii) the total and
polarized intensity, iii) the degree of linear polarization (p) and the position angle of the linear
polarization, i.e. the E-vector (θ). The periodograms suffer from signiﬁcant aliasing due to the
relatively short spin (118.2 s) and beat (117.1 s) periods, which are unresolved on single nights,
and because of the ∼24 h data gap, results in signiﬁcant cycle count ambiguity.

Just as was seen in the original study (2) for the g(cid:48) band variability, the total intensity (I)
varies predominantly at the beat frequency and its ﬁrst harmonic (Supplementary Figure 7,
right panels), with the latter being the stronger of the two. In addition, the harmonic of the
spin frequency is also clearly seen, but at a lower power compared to the beat harmonic. The
power spectra of the UV light curves derived from the Hubble Space Telescope observations

16

(2), although strongly aliased, clearly show that the power in the ﬁrst harmonics of the spin
and beat frequencies are approximately equal, implying that the white dwarfs magnetic ﬁeld is
directly (through beaming) or indirectly (through reprocessing) modulating the UV emission.
In the case for the polarized ﬂux (Supplementary Figure 7, left panels), we see a broad spread of
power at the ﬁrst harmonic, consistent with power at both spin and beat harmonic frequencies.
In the case of the 3rd harmonics, the spin component (4θ) dominates, at 29.3 s. The reason
that the power of the spin modulated polarized ﬂux and p is less than for the beat modulation is
attributed to the modulation of I occurring at two closely spaced periods (beat and spin), while
Q and U vary predominantly at the spin. Thus any calculation involving Q, U and I (as for p),
will introduce some additional power at the beat period.

Binary parameters:
AR Sco consists of a magnetic white dwarf and a M5 dwarf star orbiting one another with an
orbital period of Porb = 3.56 h. The pulsations observed from the UV to the radio show a
double peaked pulse proﬁle, predominantly at the beat period Pb, implying that the secondary
has to be a site for spin modulated reprocessing. Furthermore, narrow line emission is seen
which clearly follows the orbital motion of the secondary star and is situated near the L1 point.
Based on the limits placed, the white dwarf has a mass of M1 ≈ 0.8 M(cid:12), while the secondary
star has a mass of about M2 ≈ 0.3 M(cid:12) and therefore a mass ratio of q = (M2/M1) = 0.375.
Sinusoidal variations in the optical/IR light suggest that the secondary star is being irradiated,
with its hotter/brighter side facing the white dwarf, which is best seen at orbital phase φorb = 0.5
(superior conjunction of the secondary).

Assuming that the secondary is close to ﬁlling its Roche lobe, then the standard relationship
between the Roche lobe size of the secondary (RL,2) and binary separation (a), applicable to
binaries in the range 0.3 < q < 20 (38) is given by RL,2/a = 0.38 + 0.2 log q. For AR
Sco (q = 0.375) the orbital separation a ∼ 8 × 1010(Mwd/0.8 M(cid:12))1/3(Porb/3.56 hr)2/3 cm.
Thus the Roche lobe radius of the secondary star is estimated to be RL,2 ∼ 0.3a ∼ 2.53 ×
1010 cm. The distance of the L1 region from the white dwarf primary can be estimated from
the relation (b1/a) = 0.5 − 0.227 log q (for 0.1 < q < 10) (see e.g. 39), resulting in b1 ∼
0.6a ∼ 5 × 1010 cm. In comparison, the radius of the light cylinder, where the white dwarf
magnetosphere co-rotates with the speed of light (c = ωwd rl−c), is of the order of rl−c ∼
6 × 1011 (ωwd/0.054 rad s−1) cm, implying that the binary system is inside the white dwarf
pulsar’s light cylinder.

Luminosities:
It has been found (2) that the white dwarf in AR Sco is currently spinning down on a timescale
of τs−d = (νs/ ˙νs) ∼ 107 yr. The spin-down luminosity, assuming a 0.8M(cid:12) white dwarf, is
of the order of L ˙νs = −4π2Iνs ˙νs = 1.5 × 1033 erg s−1. The X-ray luminosity is Lx = 4.9 ×
1030 erg s−1, implying α = (Lx/L ˙νs) = 3.27 × 10−3. This is very similar to the ratio found in
spin-powered pulsars as well as the white dwarf in the cataclysmic variable system AE Aquarii
(Supplementary Figure 8), which has a ratio α ∼ 10−3, where Lx ∼ 5 × 1030 erg s−1 and

17

L ˙νs = 6 × 1033 erg s−1 (e.g. see references 4, 5, 26).

Magnetic dipole radiation:
The luminosity coming from magnetic dipole radiation (also known as Poynting ﬂux) in AR
Sco is given as:

Lm−d =

where B1,∗, ωwd, Rwd and χ represent the surface polar ﬁeld of the white dwarf, the white dwarf
spin angular velocity and radius, as well as the angle between the spin and magnetic axes. For
our calculations of luminosities we used the Hamada-Salpeter relation to determine that the
white dwarf has a radius of Rwd ∼ 5.5 × 108 (Mwd/0.8 M(cid:12))−0.8 cm.

Re-arranging this equation to determine the magnetic ﬁeld strength gives:

Spin-down torque:
It has been shown (e.g. 40, 41, 42) that the rate of dissipation of magnetic energy in the
surface layers of a cataclysmic variable secondary star of depth δ (skin-depth) is given by
˙W = (B2/8π)(4πR2
2δ) ωb, where B is the estimated magnetic ﬁeld of the white dwarf at
the distance of the secondary star, ωb is the beat period angular frequency of the white dwarf
(essentially the same as the spin angular frequency in AR Sco) and δ =
2ηtur/ωb represents
the dissipation depth of magnetic energy, where ηtur is the turbulent plasma resistivity.

The total magnetic torque exerted on the secondary star, i.e. TD = ( ˙W /ωb), results in a
synchronization timescale which is given by tsyn = Iωb/TD, where I is the moment of inertia
of the white dwarf, which is of the order of I ∼ 1.5 × 1050 g cm2. If we assume a 500 MG
dipolar magnetic ﬁeld for the white dwarf, the upper limit derived from the dipole radiation, the
ﬁeld strength at the distance of the secondary star is Bb1 ∼ 160 Gauss. For δ ∼ 108 cm, i.e.
using ηtur ≤ 1015 cm2s−1 (see e.g. 17), the magnetic torque exerted on the secondary star is of
the order TD = (B2
2 δ) ∼ 1033 erg (= dyn cm). The resulting timescale
for spin-synchronization through MHD torques for a 500 MG white dwarf is therefore tsyn ∼
2.5 × 108 yr. This supports the notion that the magnetic dissipation in the thin surface layers
of the secondary star (δ ∼ 0.004RL,2) will contribute to the dissipation of rotational kinetic
energy of the white dwarf, together with other mechanisms like magnetic dipole radiation. This
will eventually lead to the sychronization of the two stars during the current low mass accretion
phase. When accretion eventually switches on, once the M-star re-attaches to the Roche lobe,
then AR Sco will become a synchronised magnetic cataclysmic variable, or polar, consisting of
a highly magnetized white dwarf rotating synchronously with its M5 secondary companion.

Magnetic ﬁeld interactions:
It has been demonstrated (e.g. 17) that mass transferring secondary stars with orbital periods
between Porb = 3 − 4 h can have surface polar magnetic ﬁelds of the order of B◦ ∼ 3000 G,
which implies that the M5 secondary star of AR Sco will most probably be magnetically active.
This is supported by MHD modelling in convective envelopes of dwarf stars (e.g. 22). This pro-
vides a mechanism for explaining the observed spectral energy distribution of AR Sco below
ν ∼ 1013 Hz in terms of magnetic energy dissipation in the ﬁeld of the secondary star.

The ﬁeld-aligned electric potentials in the M-star magnetic ﬂux tubes are of the order of

where we assumed ∆B⊥ → Bb1 ∼ 700 G represents the perturbation induced in the coronal

against it. These coronal structures will be periodically perturbed, pushed sideways by the
rotating white dwarf ﬁeld and generating a “fracture zone” which will induce large ﬁeld-aligned
potentials that can accelerate charged particles (see 26).

In these interactions, the magnetic pitch can increase γφ = (∆B⊥/B) → 10 (see e.g. 43,
44) before the ﬁelds become unstable to reconnection. It should be mentioned that the magnetic
ﬁeld perturbation is still below the maximum magnetic ﬁeld near the poles of the secondary,
which can be of the order of 3000 G (see e.g. 17). It can be shown that electrons with energies
of the order of γe ≤ 400 trapped in pumped coronal ﬁelds of the order of a (cid:104)Bcor(cid:105) ∼ 100 G
(at a distance from the secondary surface of ∼ 2 × R2) will radiate synchrotron radiation at
e eB/(2πmec) ≤ 4×1013(γe/400)2(B/100 G) Hz, i.e. in the infrared
frequencies up to νsyn ∼ γ2
to radio regime.

can be induced between the white dwarf and the light cylinder (29), i.e. where the white dwarf
magnetosphere co-rotates at the speed of light (c = ωwd rl−c). For AR Sco the light cylinder
radius is of the order of rl−c ∼ 6 × 1011 (ωwd/0.054 rad s−1) cm. Since this electric ﬁeld is
several orders of magnitude stronger than gravity, charged particles like electrons can be pulled
from the surface of the white dwarf and accelerated to relativistic energies (45), of the order of
γe ∼ 106, resulting in synchrotron emission up to frequencies of the order of

with peak emission occurring νc ∼ 0.3νsyn ∼ 3 × 1017 Hz, in the X-ray regime.
Additionally, outside the light cylinder the fast rotating magnetosphere will turn into a rela-
tivistic magnetohydrodynamic “striped” wind (30, 31, 32 and references therein). It will consist
of zones of opposite magnetic polarity that will form current sheets, which can be a source of
particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection and pulsed incoherent synchrotron emis-
sion (see 32 for a review). The emission will be pulsed as a result of a relativistic beaming
effect due to these zones of opposite magnetic polarity that propagate outward at relativistic
velocities (v → c), separated by ∆l = πrL (here rL is the light cylinder radius). Each outward
propagating zone is beaming radiation into a forward cone of opening angle θ ∼ 2/γ, where
γ represents the wind Lorentz factor. Pulses will be observed when the time delay between
emission on each expanding wave front that intersects the observer, i.e. ∆t ∼ R/2γ2c), is less
than the time delay between the radiation from two successive outward propagating wave fronts
(∆T = ∆l/c).

A characteristic of the synchrotron radiation from the striped wind outside the light cylinder
radius is the fact that the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld component oscillates in the same sense as the
rotating pulsar, which results in pulsations at both the fundamental and ﬁrst harmonic of the
spin period. The emission is also expected to be polarized, emitting both linear and a small
component of circular polarized light (32). Applied to the Crab pulsar, numerical simulations
of the expected pulse proﬁles produced in a striped wind mimic exactly the observed pulse
proﬁles, together with the position angle swings through 180◦. The observed polarized pulse
proﬁles of AR Sco (Figures 3 and 4), especially near orbital phase Φo ∼ 0.15, mimic that of the
Crab pulsar, perhaps implying that a striped pulsar wind is active in AR Sco. The fact that the
striped wind occurs in a binary system may further introduce a beat frequency in the pulsations.
Both these processes, namely synchrotron emission in the vicinity of the light cylinder,
or outside in the striped pulsar-like wind, can account for the nature of the polarized pulsed
emission seen in optical lightcurves of AR Sco. Both processes can explain the polarization,
i.e. a signature of synchrotron radiation, pulsed at both the white dwarf spin period and the beat
(synodic) period.
