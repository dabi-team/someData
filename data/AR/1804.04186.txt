Abstract:   

Evacuation is one of the main disaster management solutions to reduce the impact of man-made and natural threats 
on building occupants. To date, several modern technologies and gamification concepts, e.g. immersive virtual 
reality and serious games, have been used to enhance building evacuation preparedness and effectiveness. Those 
tools  have  been  used  both  to  investigate  human  behavior  during  building  emergencies  and  to  train  building 
occupants on how to cope with building evacuations. 

Augmented Reality (AR) is novel technology that can enhance this process providing building occupants  with 
virtual contents to improve their evacuation performance. This work aims at reviewing existing AR applications 
developed for building evacuation. This review identifies the disasters and types of building those tools have been 
applied for. Moreover, the application goals, hardware and evacuation stages affected by AR are also investigated 
in  the  review.  Finally,  this  review  aims  at  identifying  the  challenges  to  face  for  further  development  of  AR 
evacuation tools. 

Keywords: Building Evacuation, Augmented Reality, Disasters, Hardware 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Building evacuations are one of the key risk reduction strategies for buildings affected by man-made and natural 
disasters. To date, many studies have been carried out focusing on the investigation of human behavior in disasters 
such  as  fire  and  earthquakes  and  to  simulate  those  behavior  in  evacuation  model  tools  (Gwynne  et  al.,  1999; 
Kuligowski, Peacock and Hoskins, 2010; Lindell and Perry, 2012; Lovreglio et al., 2017). 

Novel technologies, such as virtual reality and serious games, have been proved to be fundamental to investigate 
human behavior in disasters and to enhance building occupants’ preparedness. For instance, virtual reality  has 
been used (1) to investigate the occupant perception of evacuation systems (Ronchi and Nilsson, 2015; Olander et 
al., 2017); (2) to investigate evacuee route and exit choices (Andrée, Kristin, Daniel Nilsson, 2015; Cosma, Ronchi 
and  Nilsson,  2016;  Lovreglio,  Fonzone  and  Dell’Olio,  2016);  (3)  evacuee  navigation  (Lovreglio,  Ronchi  and 
Nilsson, 2015b; Moussaïd et al., 2016; Kyriakou, Pan and Chrysanthou, 2017; Rios, Mateu and Pelechano, 2108); 
and to train building occupants for fire and earthquake emergencies as reviewed in (Lovreglio et al., 2018; Zhenan 
Feng et al., 2018). 

Augmented Reality (AR) is a novel technology which is gaining popularity among the public since the release of 
new AR ardware (i.e. Microsoft HoloLens, Meta 2) and software in the last years (i.e. Pokemon Go). Furthermore, 
AR is a technology that could help enhance building evacuation performance by providing users with real-time 
digital information.    This would allow users to make real-time in-place best actions decisions during evacuations 
and emergencies. 

The aim of this work is to review existing AR applications for building evacuation to identify which fields and 
disasters  those  tools  have  been  applied  to  and  to  highlight  the  challenges  to  face  while  developing  an  AR 
application for building evacuation. 

2. BACKGROUND 

2.2 Augmented Reality 

Augmented  Reality  (AR)  is  a  live  view  of  the  real-world  environment  whose  elements  are  "augmented"  by 
computer-generated visual information (Carmigniani et al., 2011). As such, this technology occupies a specific 
place in the reality-virtuality spectrum illustrated in Figure 1. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 – Reality-virtuality spectrum 

From Figure 1, it is possible to observe that AR occupies the left-hand side of the reality-virtuality spectrum as the 
main component is reality while the computer-generated visual information is a secondary component augmenting 
the reality. 

AR can provide both a direct or indirect live view of the augmented environment. A direct view can be provided 
using lenses where computer-generated information is projected to be reflected in the user’s eyes while an indirect 
view is obtained by using a camera and a display showing live and augmented video stream (Carmigniani et al., 
2011). 

These AR algorithms usually consist of two stages: tracking and reconstructing/recognizing. The tracking can be 
done using markers (e.g. QR codes) or using markerless systems. In the first case, the algorithms constantly search 
for defined markers to impose digital elements using those markers as reference points. In the second case, more 
advanced techniques, such as Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) and Structure from Motion (SfM) 
are  used  for  mapping  fiducial  markers  relative  positions  (Carmigniani  et  al., 2011).  A  review  of  AR  tracking, 
interaction and display solutions is available in (Feng Zhou, Duh and Billinghurst, 2008; Wagner and Schmalstieg, 
2009). 

2.1 Building Evacuation 

To  investigate  AR  applications  for  building  evacuation,  it  is  worth  briefly  describing  the  stage  and  events 
characterizing evacuations. The evacuation of a building threatened by a man-made or natural disasters can be 
seen as the sum of several sequential events. The time required to complete a building evacuation is known in the 
literature as the required safe egress time (RSET). This time is required to be smaller than the available safe egress 
time (ASET), which is the time available to evacuate a building  safely before the building conditions become 
untenable for occupants (Lovreglio, 2016). RSET can be divided into several subsequetial times as shown in Figure 
2. As such, several steps need to be completed to have a successful evacuation.   

Figure 2 – Timeline building evacuation framework (Lovreglio, 2016) 

One of the most critical time is the total evacuation time since it accounts for human behaviour and response to an 
emergency. For some types of disasters, such as fire and bushfire, the pre-evacuation stage can be the most critical 
one as building occupants need time to recognise the emergencies and to get ready before the actual evacuation 
(Lovreglio, Ronchi and Nilsson, 2015a, 2016). For other disasters, such as earthquakes, building occupants can 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
easily perceive that the building is shaking while they might require time to respond (Lovreglio et al., 2017). 

The final stage of a building evacuation, it is the actual movement towards a safe place, e.g. an assembly point. In 
this stage, building occupants are asked to find a safe way out using the available zinformation provided by fire 
wardens and building evacuation systems such as evacuation lightings. 

Virtual reality and augmented virtuality have been broadly used to investigate human behavior and to train building 
occupants  in  different  evaluation  stages.  To  date,  several  reviews  are  available  in  the  literature  investigating 
different evacuation purposes of virtual reality tools see for instance (Kinateder et al., 2014; Zhenan Feng et al., 
2018). However, a comprehensive literature review of AR applications for building evacuation is still not available. 
As such, this research aims at covering this research gap. 

2. METHOD 

2.1 Review Objective 

The  proposed  review  of  AR  applications  for  building  evacuations  is  designed  to  fulfil  the  following  three 
objectives: 

1.  The identification of the building disasters where the AR applications have been applied; 
2.  The investigation which evacuation stage has been affected by the AR application; 
3.  The study of the hardware used for AR applications. 

Those objectives have been defining to have a general overview of this subject as well as identify research gaps 
for future research and AR development. 

2.2 Work Selection 

The papers selected for this review  were collected from journals, conferences, patents and reports. The papers 
were recovered from the following databases: Google Scholar and Scopus. 

The selected works needed to address two major concepts: augmented reality and building evacuation. The search 
was conducted using the following combination of key words: augmented reality or smart glasses + evacuation or 
building evacuation. Only works written in English were included in the first search. Such a search was run on the 
1st of April 2018 and yield to the first selection of 22 works out of 200 works accessed through Scopus and Google 
Scholar. This first selection was done making sure that the selected key words were at least mentioned in the title 
and abstract of those works. 

A second selection was then carried out considering the two selection criteria: 

(a)  An AR application for building evacuation was proposed; 
(b)  An AR application was tested through experiments. 

Only 12 papers met at least of the two criteria and were finally included in the review. The full selection process 
described in this section is illustrated in Figure 3.

3. RESULTS 

A list of the selected papers is provided  in Table 1. The results indicate that all the selected papers have been 
published in the last eight years (the least recent work was published in 2010) showing that applications of AR for 
building  evacuation  are  recent  research  goals.  Besides  the  general  applications  listed  in  Table  1,  most  of  the 
remaining applications focus on Tsunami, Earthquake and Fire building evacuations. Moreover, the results indicate 
that those applications have been mainly developed for educational buildings and large-scale buildings. 

3.1 Application Goals 

This review identified three types of AR application for building evacuation.   

The  majority  of  the  applications  (5  out  of  9)  were  developed  for  training  purposes.  Those  applications  were 
conceived to overcome the well known limitations of traditional evacuation drills which are reviewed in (Gwynne 
et al., 2016, 2017). As such, those applications trying to enhance the realism and engagement of the evacuation 
drills showing the impact of the threats on the buildings and its occupants. For instance, Kawai et al. (2016a) López 
et al. (2010) augmented drills with digital fires, smoke, injured occupants and cracks generated by an earthquake 
and building fire. Iguchi et al. (2016) and Mitsuhara et al. (2017) also augmented their earthquake drills with the 
damage generated as well as with digital building occupants the participants are supposed to interact with. 

Another  type  of  AR  application  goal  is  to  navigate  building  occupants  during  building  evacuations.  Those 
applications were developed for large-scale buildings having complex geometries to help building occupants with 
wayfinding information. For instance, Ahn and Han (2011) and Cai et al. (2011) developed a navigation system 
that  potentially  can  be  used  for  any  types  of  disaster  while  López  (2010)  proposed  a  smart  system  for  fire 
emergencies supporting occupants depending on their characteristics and fire location.   

Finally, the latest type of application is to visualize building evacuation simulations. This solution was recently 
developed  by  Lochhead  and  Hedley  (2018)  to  investigate  if  and  how  AR  can  be  used  to  evacuee  movement 
simulated by existing evacuation models. As such, they provide a new approach to link evacuation simulations 
with the real-world context of the built environment. 

3.2 Type of Hardware 

Most of the AR applications listed in Table 1 were developed using indirect AR non-immersive and immersive 
technologies.  Smartphones  and  tablets  are  the  common  non-immersive  solutions  while  Oculus  and  Google 
cardboards were used as immersive solutions. Although the immersive solutions can enhance the level of realism, 
Kawai et al. (2016b) reported that they could also produce motion sickness and discomfort for users. 

In few instances, direct AR technologies were used. For example, Kawai et al. (2016a) and Mitsuhara et al. (2017) 
tested smart glasses named Moverio. Both references argued that the main limitations of Moverio are the small 
field of view where digital contents can be visualized and the user difficulty in interacting with the device. 

To date, there is only one study comparing pros and cons of different AR pieces of hardware from a user viewpoint. 
Mitsuhara et al. (2017) tested and compared the use of Oculus, Google cardboard and Moverio for training purpose. 
After  testing  those  three  alternatives,  the  participants  rated  those  solutions  regarding  usability  and  visual 
capabilities. The results indicate that Google cardboards had the best performance. 

Table 1 shows that many AR application running on smartphones and tables required markers as those devices are 
not capable of handling the SLAM and SfM algorithms described in Section 2.1. In some occasions, those devices 
are used without markers as there is a cloud system locating the devices and providing them with the appropriate 
digital contents. 

3.3. Evacuation Stages 

All the reviewed applications focus on the movement stage during building evacuations. In fact, all the navigation 
systems  in  Table  1  are  developed  to  provide  wayfinding  information  to  building  occupants  to  enhance  their 
evacuation performance. On the other hand, the training applications used digital contents to enhance the realism 
of the evacuation routes with the cues of disasters (e.g. fire and smoke) or the impact of the disasters on the building 
and its occupants (e.g. cracks and injured occupants).

Only a couple of applications also focus on the pre-evacuation stage.  Mitsuhara et al. (2017) and Iguchi et al. 
(2016) developed a training AR application for school teachers who are asked to interact with digital pre school 
students during an earthquake shaking before starting evacuating after the end of the shake. 

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 

This  paper  introduces  a  literature  review  of  the  existing  Augmented  Reality  (AR)  applications  developed  for 
building evacuations. This review identifies 11 relevant conference and journal papers and 1 USA patent. 

This  review  shows  that  several  applications  have  been  developed  mainly  for  disasters  such  as  tsunamis, 
earthquakes and fires affecting educational buildings and large-scale buildings. As such, applications for many 
other man-made or natural disasters (e.g. terroristic attacks, bushfires and hurricanes) have not been investigated 
yet. 

The reviewed works indicate that AR applications have been used for training purpose to enhance the realism of 
traditional evacuation drills adding digital contents. Moreover, several applications have been developed with the 
aim of providing building occupant with wayfinding solutions to enhance their evacuation performance. A novel 
application is the use AR to visualize the result of evacuation simulation in real-world contexts. 

This  paper  shows  that  several  indirect  and  direct  AR  technologies  have  been  used.  The  review  indicates  that 
indirect immersive AR solutions such as Oculus can generate motion sickness while direct AR solutions such as 
Moverio  have  a  limited  field  of  view  that  reduces  the  immersion.  It  is  possible  to  argue  that  those  existing 
limitations can be easily overcome by using more recent direct AR hardware solutions such as Microsoft HoloLens 
and Meta 2. However, implementations using those two innovative solutions are still not available in the literature. 

This review illustrates that all the AR applications were developed to affect the movement stage during building 
evacuations and only in two instances those applications were used for training purpose during the pre-evacuation 
stage. Therefore, future studies are necessary to investigate how AR tools can enhance pre-evacuation training and 
how those tools can support building occupants during real emergencies providing them with the best action to 
take.
