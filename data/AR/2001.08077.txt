Abstract: One of the most powerful techniques for direct detection of dark matter via elastic
scattering of galactic WIMPs is the use of liquid argon time projection chambers. Atmospheric
argon (AAr) has a naturally occurring radioactive isotope, 39Ar, of cosmogenic origin. The use
of argon extracted from underground wells, deprived of 39Ar, is key to the physics potential of
these experiments. The DarkSide-20k (DS-20k) dark matter search experiment will operate with 50
tonnes of radio-pure underground argon (UAr), extracted from the Urania plant in Cortez (USA) and
puriﬁed in the Aria distillation plant (Sardinia, Italy). Assessing the radio-purity of UAr in terms of
39Ar is crucial for the success of DS-20k, as well as for future experiments of the Global Argon Dark
Matter Collaboration (GADMC), and will be done with the experiment named DArT in ArDM.
DArT is a small chamber that will contain the argon under test. The detector will be immersed
in the LAr active volume of the ArDM detector, located at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory
(LSC) in Spain, which will act as active veto for background events coming from photons from
detector materials and surrounding rock radioactivity.

Introduction

Neutrino [1, 2] and Dark Matter [3–5] observation requires devices highly sensitive to tiny signals
over large detecting volumes. A large volume of a high purity noble element, like argon and xenon
can provide, in principle, the sensitivity and detector-mass scalability required for those kinds of
rare event searches. Additionally, the detection properties of liquid argon are particularly attractive
for Dark Matter detectors, due to background rejection capability of signal-like nuclear recoils and
electronic background using the diﬀerent time distribution of the light output produced by these
interactions. The DEAP-3600 experiment, with 3200 kg of LAr, has demonstrated an exceptional
pulse shape discrimination (PSD) against such background, projected to be over 109 [6].

Argon extracted from the atmosphere consists mostly in stable isotopes. However, three natural
isotopes are produced by the interaction with the cosmic rays: 39Ar, 37Ar and 42Ar [7]. The 39Ar
has the largest abundance and activity of the three ones. It produces a β decay with a Q-value of
565 keV and its activity have been measured to be 1 Bq/kg [8]. For low background argon-based
detectors 39Ar is often the dominant source of interactions at low energies. Moreover, the pile-up
and high rates produced by 39Ar make diﬃcult the operation of these detectors.

The DarkSide-50 collaboration has measured the activity of underground argon (UAr) to be
0.73 mBq/kg [9], equivalent to a 1400 depletion factor (DF) with respect to the AAr. For this
reason, the next generation of Dark Matter direct detection experiments will operate with UAr in
order to mitigate the eﬀects of 39Ar . The DS-20k collaboration will extract at least 50 tonnes of
UAr with the Urania plant. Urania will be able to deliver 330 kg/day of 99.99% purity UAr. The
UAr will be further chemically puriﬁed to detector-grade argon in Aria at the rate of 1 tonne/day.
Aria is a 350 m cryogenic distillation plant currently being commissioned in Sardinia, Italy.

The DArT in ArDM experiment will measure the concentration of 39Ar in the UAr delivered
by Urania and Aria and will operate at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC, Spain). In the
low background environment of the LSC, DArT in ArDM will be sensitive to very high depletion
factors of 39Ar.

2 The DArT in ArDM experiment

DArT is a single-phase liquid argon detector, of about one litre active volume, that will be ﬁlled
with underground argon samples. The light produced by the interactions in the active volume will
be readout by two 1 cm2 cryogenic silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) [10] that come, together with
the readout electronics, from the DS-20k production chain. An optical ﬁber reaching the inside
of the chamber, illuminated with an LED, will be used to monitor the response of the SiPMs with
time.

DArT has been built with radio-pure materials to minimize the background induced by the
intrinsic radioactive contamination of the detector. The outer vessel is made of ultra-pure 99.99%
Oxygen Free High Conductivity (OHFC) copper, with only 4 ppm of oxygen (Fig. 1-Left). The
inner structure is made of radio-pure acrylic (PMMA) and the surfaces exposed to the argon are
properly sanded to suppress the plate-out of 222Rn daughters. The instrumentation and services
of DArT are attached to the top ﬂange, so that they are easily accessible by removing the copper
vessel. Two 15 cm long copper pipes penetrate inside the vessel. A thinner pipe oﬀ axis, that goes
all the way down the vessel, is used to ﬁll the chamber with argon. A wider pipe, in the centre,
stops at the top ﬂange, allowing to route the necessary connections (SiPM HV, signal, level meter,
etc.) through radio-pure cables.

inner support with the reﬂector around the active volume. The 2 PDM’s are installed at top and bottom sides
of the detector. (Right) Scheme of DArT inserted in the ArDM detector.

The inner structure is made of 8 acrylic pieces (Fig. 1-Center): 1 attachment to the top cover,
1 outer and 1 inner cylinders, 2 SiPM supports, 2 end caps, and 1 facilities support on bottom.
The two 6 mm thick disks are placed between the argon active volume and the two SiPMs. Both

disks and the inner acrylic cylinder are coated with wavelength shifter (TPB) on its inner surface
(200 µg/cm2). The outer surface of the acrylic is enrolled in a Vikuiti reﬂector foil. An additional
cylinder (annulus) is used as ﬁller of the space outside the reﬂector foil. The outer acrylic parts is
attached to the top vessel ﬂange. Two dedicated boards, on top and bottom, attached to two acrylics
disk using acrylic screws hold the SiPMs used for reading out the light signals.

DArT will be placed in the centre of the 1 tonne liquid argon detector ArDM [11] (Fig. 1-Right),
which will act as active veto against internal and external radiation. The single-phase setup of ArDM
will be used, with a new set of low-radioactivity photo-multipliers (PMT), 6 on the top and 7 on the
bottom, surrounded by a reﬂector foil covered with TPB. The whole setup is embedded in a 50 cm
thick polyethylene shielding (not visible in the ﬁgure). In order to suppress the impact of external
gammas, which dominate the background budget, a 6 tonne lead shield will be installed around the
ArDM vessel, in the hollow space between the ArDM cryostat and polyethylene shielding. The
lead shield is a 140 cm height octagonal prism, with 10 cm width walls. In this conﬁguration, the
detector will be capable of measuring with high precision the larger 39Ar depletion factors of the
UAr batches coming from the Urania plant.

3 Detector performance

In the DArT detector, signal events are electron recoils from the β decay of 39Ar, which have
an energy end-point of 565 keV. These events deposit all the energy in DArT leaving no signal
in the veto detector, ArDM. The range of the energy spectrum in DArT below 600 keV is called
region of interest (ROI), as virtually all signal events pertain to it. Background events stem from
radioactive decays in the detector materials and in the experimental hall surrounding the detector.
They typically produce γ particles that deposit energy in DArT and/or in ArDM. We assume that
nuclear recoils are rejected using the pulse shape discrimination technique, than in liquid argon
is very powerful. The background events that leave a signal-like imprint in the DArT ROI, and
an energy they deposit in ArDM above 10 keV, are tagged as background and removed from the
analysis. However, if the energy they deposit in ArDM is below that threshold, they cannot be
tagged. These untagged events are the background of the experiment.

Extensive studies of the physics reach of the experiment are performed with tuned-on-data
Monte Carlo simulations based on Geant4, with the simulation framework of the DarkSide-50
experiment (G4DS [12]). This package contains a detailed geometrical description of DArT and
ArDM including the new lead shield. Predictions for the number of signal and background events
expected in the ROI are based on these simulations. For the background activity, actual data of the
screened materials and measurements in the underground hall A of the LSC are used. The total
number of background events per week in the ROI with the lead shield is 7210 out of which 465 are
untagged, around 35% of these correspond to external background. For comparison, the expected
number of background events in the ROI without a lead shield is 122000, with 10300 untagged
events per week, 96% is external background (Fig. 2-Left).

The energy deposits in the liquid argon of DArT produce VUV photons that, once converted
to visible photons (420 nm) by the TPB, are either detected by the two SiPMs or lost in a dead
area. The simulation of the propagation of photons to the SiPMs with Geant4 takes into account the
optical properties of the detector materials and their interfaces, in particular the acrylic (PMMA),

the TPB coating of the internal surfaces, the reﬂector foil and the SiPM planes. Absorbed photons
in the SiPMs planes are converted to photo-electrons, with a photon detection eﬃciency (PDE) of
40%. Simulation parameters are tuned according to reference [12]).

The light response of the detector is evaluated simulating 20000 39Ar events in the DArT
active volume. The number of VUV-photons produced is 48 ph/ keV, which are converted into
visible photons with an eﬃciency of 98.5%. The reﬂector foil is placed on the sides of the active
volume and on the top and bottom acrylic caps, around the SiPMs. The average light collection
eﬃciency is about 58%, that corresponds to a light yield of 11 PE/ keV. Events closer to one of the
detection planes have larger collection eﬃciency. The dependence of the eﬃciency on the radius of
the interaction position is more pronounced for events close to the SiPMs, for geometrical reasons.
However, the overall light collection eﬃciency is uniform. The energy resolution is calculated with
monoenegetic deposits from 50 keV up to 800 keV uniformly distributed in the DArT active volume.
An energy resolution between 3 % and 6 % is found in the ROI.

After the characterization of the background and the light response in DArT, we evaluate the
sensitivity expected for diﬀerent 39Ar depletion factors. The photoelectron spectrum for signal and
background expected is generated using a lookup-table base in the 39Ar events. The 39Ar content
is extracted from a ﬁt of the observed shape to the randomized weighted sum of the signal and
background distributions. From these ﬁts, the expected statistical uncertainties per week on the
measurement of diﬀerent depletion factors of 39Ar are shown in Fig. 2-Right. The 90% one-sided
conﬁdence level upper limit (1.28 sigma) is reached with a 5000 DF without the lead shield, this
value is increased a factor 10 (50000 DF) with the lead shield. Additionally, in the conﬁguration
with the lead shield, the uncertainty is below 1% for a depletion factor of 10, 1% for DF = 100,
7% for DF = 1400 and 40% for DF = 14000. Without the lead shied, the statistical uncertainties

increase, typically, by a factor 3.

These results obtained assume the knowledge of the signal and background shape from the
simulations and, therefore, do not include systematic uncertainties. Systematic uncertainties on the
39Ar decay spectrum can be signiﬁcantly reduced validating the simulated spectra with a large data
sample in an AAr run.

4 Conclusions

UAr is the key for the next generation Dark Matter experiments. Also, neutrino experiments will
beneﬁt from high purity UAr. The Global Argon Dark Matter Collaboration has put in place a very
ambitious program for the UAr production at large scale. The DArT in ArDM detector will play a
fundamental role in this project. We have designed en experiment capable of measuring with high
precision the residual amount of 39Ar in the argon of small samples. The performance of DArT
has been studied with detailed background and optical simulations. These studies show that our
detector would allow us to measure UAr depletion factors above 1000 with less than 10% statistical
precision. The construction of DArT is in a well-advanced stage and is expected to start operations
at the beginning of 2020.
