1. Introduction

Abstract.
Intense extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pulses enable the investigation of
XUV-induced nonlinear processes and are a prerequisite for the development of
attosecond pump - attosecond probe experiments. While highly nonlinear processes
in the XUV range have been studied at free-electron lasers (FELs), high-harmonic
generation (HHG) has allowed the investigation of low-order nonlinear processes. Here
we suggest a concept to optimize the HHG intensity, which surprisingly requires a
scaling of the experimental parameters that diﬀers substantially from optimizing the
HHG pulse energy. As a result, we are able to study highly nonlinear processes in
the XUV range using a driving laser with a modest (≈ 10 mJ) pulse energy. We
demonstrate our approach by ionizing Ar atoms up to Ar5+, requiring the absorption
of at least 10 XUV photons.

Three key features of intense XUV pulses from FEL and HHG sources have opened
up new possibilities for a range of ﬁelds from life science to material science and
fundamental physics: (i) Intense XUV pulses provide the possibility to perform pump-
probe experiments, in which a ﬁrst XUV pump pulse initiates dynamics in an atom
or a molecule, and these dynamics are probed by a second, time-delayed XUV probe
pulse. This capability has been extensively used with femtosecond time resolution at
FELs (see e.g. Ref. [1]) and has been implemented with attosecond time resolution
using HHG sources [2, 3]. (ii) Intense, coherent XUV pulses have enabled single-shot
coherent diﬀractive imaging (CDI) of isolated nanotargets with a resolution in the tens of
nanometers range. While these experiments are predominantly performed at FELs [4],
CDI on He nanodroplets using an intense HHG source was recently reported [5]. (iii)

High XUV intensities enable the study of nonlinear optics in this spectral range.
Examples include multiple ionization of atoms [6] and XUV-driven four-wave mixing
schemes [7].

Advantages of HHG sources compared to FELs include their smaller size and lower
costs resulting in easier access to these sources. Another important point is that two-
color XUV-optical pump-probe experiments, which are one of the preferred applications
of ultrashort XUV pulses, are challenging at FELs due to timing jitter between the
optical and XUV beams [8]. Such experiments are routinely performed using HHG
sources, with a time resolution extending into the attosecond domain, given the fact
that attosecond pulses based on HHG have been generated for more than 10 years [9].
The most common scheme used to generate intense HHG pulses requires powerful
near-infrared (NIR) pulses that are loosely focused into a gas medium to increase the
generation volume [3, 10–13]. It has been shown that the HHG pulse energy increases
with increasing NIR focal length [14]. In contrast, we demonstrate in this paper that
for a given laboratory size the XUV intensity on target can be optimized by using an
NIR focusing element with a relatively short focal length. This enables the generation
of a smaller XUV beam waist radius in the experiment and a higher XUV beamline
transmission. As a result, we achieve an estimated XUV intensity in our laboratory of
7 × 1014 W/cm2, allowing us to study highly nonlinear processes, which we demonstrate
in this paper by ionizing neutral Ar atoms up to Ar5+.

2. HHG intensity scaling

Investigations on HHG scaling have shown that the HHG conversion eﬃciency may
be preserved when varying the laser power, as long as all relevant parameters such as
the focusing geometry and the gas pressure and length of the HHG medium are scaled
appropriately [15]. One can further assume that the NIR intensity used to optimize the
HHG conversion eﬃciency is nearly independent of the chosen experimental conditions,
given that the optimum NIR intensity is dictated by phase-matching conditions that are
largely determined by the choice of laser wavelength and target gas. As a result, the XUV
intensity obtained directly behind the generation medium is to a good approximation
independent of the NIR focusing geometry. Therefore, in order to optimize the peak
XUV intensity in the experiment, we apply the following strategy:
(1) We choose
a beamline geometry leading to a large demagniﬁcation D = wXU V,source/wXU V,f ocus
(where wXU V,source is the XUV beam waist radius at the HHG source and wXU V,f ocus
is the XUV beam waist radius after focusing). (2) The HHG beamline transmission is
optimized by using as few XUV optical elements (ﬁlters, mirrors) as possible, as each
of these elements introduces high losses.

To study how the demagniﬁcation of the XUV beam radius from the HHG source
to the XUV focus in the experiment depends on the NIR focal length dN IR, we have
performed calculations based on Gaussian beams in the paraxial approximation using
ABCD matrices [16]. While typical XUV beams from HHG may be non-Gaussian, it

laboratory). (a) XUV beam waist radius (blue curve) and demagniﬁcation resulting

in our setup. (b) Anticipated XUV pulse energy (blue curve) and XUV peak intensity

lengths.

is known that certain fundamental correlations are equivalent for Gaussian and non-
Gaussian beams [17].
In particular, the product of divergence and minimal beam
diameter is preserved while propagating the beam through an ABCD optical system.
Hence, using Gaussian optics is the most straightforward way to study scaling of the
XUV intensity that can be achieved in an experiment.

In the calculations, we have taken into account that our laboratory allows a
maximum distance of 18 m between the last NIR mirror preceding the HHG source
and the mirror that focuses the XUV radiation onto the target. Furthermore, an XUV
mirror with a focal length of fXU V = 75 mm was assumed, which is the shortest focal
length that can be used in combination with our velocity-map imaging spectrometer
(VMIS). In addition, we have assumed that the XUV source radius is 50 % of the NIR
beam waist radius.

The results of the calculations are shown in Fig. 1. The XUV beam waist radius
in the experiment (blue curve in Fig. 1(a)) increases rapidly with increasing NIR focal
length dN IR, both due to the increasing XUV source size (as a result of the increasing
NIR focus) and the decreasing demagniﬁcation. The demagniﬁcation calculated by
Gaussian optics (solid orange curve) is to a good approximation equal to D ≈ d/fXU V
for short focal lengths (dotted orange curve), where d is the distance from the HHG
source to the XUV mirror. The two curves based on the diﬀerent approaches deviate
for long NIR focal lengths where the XUV beam has a very low divergence. This can be
understood by considering the limit of an almost collimated XUV beam, when using an
extremely loosely focused NIR beam: In this case, the demagniﬁcation would increase

with dN IR because of the increasing XUV source size. In our experimental setup, we
chose d ≈ 13 m. This results in a demagniﬁcation of 173, independent of whether we
assume Gaussian optics or demagniﬁcation according to simple geometrical optics.

The global HHG scaling laws presented in Ref. [15] show that a constant HHG
conversion eﬃciency can be obtained following the change of one parameter (e.g. the
NIR pulse energy), if all other relevant parameters (including the NIR focal length
and the NIR beam size before focusing) are changed accordingly. In particular, the NIR
intensity needs to be kept constant both before focusing (to avoid damage of the focusing
optics) and at the focus (for optimal phase matching). This results in an expected linear
increase of the XUV pulse energy as a function of the NIR focal length [15], as shown
in Fig. 1(b) (blue curve). The expected XUV intensity on target (orange curve) shows
opposite behavior: It increases with decreasing fN IR, since the smaller XUV focal spot
size more than compensates for the lower XUV energy that is obtained. In Fig. 1(c) we
show how the demagniﬁcation depends on the size of the ratio between the XUV source
radius that is assumed and the NIR beam waist radius. Importantly, the demagniﬁcation
for long NIR focal lengths changes quite drastically with the ratio of the XUV and NIR
beam waists, while it is hardly aﬀected for short NIR focal lengths. As a consequence,
our results are valid for a broad range of XUV source sizes, a quantity that is not always
easy to determine experimentally.

According to these scaling laws, the use of a very short NIR focal length can be used
to optimize the focused XUV intensity. However, under such conditions the divergence
of the XUV beam is substantial, and restrictions due to ﬁnite XUV ﬁlter and mirror
apertures (which cannot be made arbitrarily large) have to be taken into account, while
at the same time the requirements on the quality of the XUV focusing optics increase.
As a compromise, we have performed ﬁrst experiments using d ≈ 13 m. Besides oﬀering
a large demagniﬁcation, a further advantage of our beamline geometry is the occurrence
of a comparably low NIR intensity on the Al ﬁlter that is used to block the NIR light
co-propagating with the XUV beam. This removes the need for additional mirrors [18]
which are often used in high-power HHG applications to attenuate the NIR intensity.

3. Experimental setup

The experiments were performed at a recently installed HHG beamline at the Max-
Born-Institut. The driving laser concept is based on optical parametric chirped pulse
ampliﬁcation (OPCPA) of a broadband seed beam. The pulses originate from a
commercial frontend [19] and have a spectrum ranging from 675 nm to 1025 nm.
Three high-energy pump beams centered at 515 nm with a total energy > 180 mJ
are generated via frequency doubling of the output from two thin-disk regenerative
ampliﬁers. Ampliﬁcation is achieved in three stages utilizing beta barium borate (BBO)
as a parametric gain medium to yield signal pulse energies up to 42 mJ at a repetition
rate of 100 Hz [20]. The initially negatively chirped pulses are compressed using
positive material dispersion followed by positively chirped mirrors that are placed in

a vacuum chamber. The spectral phase can further be adjusted using an acousto-optic
programmable dispersive ﬁlter (DAZZLER) placed in the seed beam, which enables a
temporal compression to a pulse duration < 9 fs. The NIR driving pulse energy used
for HHG can be varied by changing the pump energy.

Our experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2. We chose a telescopic focusing setup for
the NIR pulses using a concave mirror (f = 1.5 m) and a convex mirror (f = −1 m),
which has three advantages compared to using a single NIR focusing mirror: (i) Due
to the decreased beam size on the last NIR mirror, a large f-number of about 400 can
be achieved, along with a comparably large NIR beam waist radius of 270 µm, thereby
(ii) The distance between the last

mirror and the NIR focal plane can be easily adjusted by varying the distance between
the concave and the convex mirror. (iii) Astigmatism can be compensated by optimizing
the reﬂection angle on the telescope mirrors.

In the setup, the distance between the last NIR mirror and the NIR focal plane is
about 5 m. A motorized iris is placed behind the last NIR mirror to optimize the HHG
yield, and an NIR driving energy of 11 mJ is measured behind this iris (for an aperture
of 10 mm). A 30 cm long gas cell is placed 10 cm in front of the focus, and is statically
ﬁlled with Xe using a backing pressure of 7 mbar. Gas dynamics simulations were
performed, showing that the gas pressure within the cell is about an order of magnitude
lower. A comparison with HHG calculations [21] indicates a gas pressure in the cell of
about 0.5 mbar.

A 100 nm thick Al ﬁlter is placed 12 m downstream from the HHG cell and is
used to block the co-propagating NIR light. The XUV pulses are focused into the
interaction zone of the VMIS using a spherical B4C-coated mirror with a focal length
of 75 mm. Argon atoms are injected into the instrument using a piezoelectric valve.
The central part of the atomic beam is selected by a molecular beam skimmer with an
oriﬁce diameter of 0.5 mm. Ion distributions are recorded in a spatially-resolved manner
along the XUV propagation axis using the spatial imaging mode of the VMIS [22]. To
this end, the multichannel plate (MCP) used in our VMIS is gated, and the spatial
distributions of the ionic charge states are recorded according to their speciﬁc ﬂight

times.
In addition, the HHG beam diameter can be measured by moving a planar
grating into the beam path and steering the zeroth diﬀraction order onto an MCP /
phosphor screen assembly that is placed 12.5 m downstream from the HHG cell.

4. Estimation of the XUV intensity

An XUV pulse energy of 56 nJ was measured behind two 100 nm Al ﬁlters using an
XUV photodiode (AXUV100G) placed 12.5 m downstream from the HHG cell. This
corresponds to an estimated XUV pulse energy of 0.7 µJ directly behind the gas cell.
We note that a new Al ﬁlter with thinner oxide layers was used for measuring the ion
distributions after this characterization measurement, resulting in a higher transmission
of 40 %. Taking into account an average reﬂectivity of the XUV focusing mirror of about
25 %, the XUV pulse energy E in the VMIS experiment is expected to be ≈ 70 nJ. We
have further estimated an XUV beam waist radius w0 as 1.3 µm (see below). The
nonlinearity of the HHG process is expected to lead to the production of XUV pulses
Indeed,
that are substantially shorter than the duration of the NIR driving pulse.
previous measurements have reported HHG pulse durations which are shorter than the
fundamental pulse duration by factors ranging from 1.6 to 2.9 [23, 24]. Accordingly,
assuming an XUV pulse duration of ∆t = 4 fs, the XUV peak intensity is estimated as
Ipeak = 2E/(∆tπw2

0) ≈ 7 × 1014 W/cm2.

The beam waist radius of 1.3 µm was inferred from spatially resolved measurements
of the formation of multiply charged Ar ions that will be discussed in Sec. 5. An even
smaller XUV beam waist radius is suggested by calculations that were performed to
study HHG under the conditions of our experiment [21]. The results of these calculations
show that reshaping of the driving laser in the HHG medium plays an important role,
resulting in eﬃcient, phase-matched HHG. Furthermore, a short attosecond pulse train
was predicted in the focus of the experiment [21]. Taking into account the attosecond
pulse structure and the prediction of an XUV beam waist radius of 320 nm that was
found in the calculations, an even higher XUV intensity of 9 × 1015 W/cm2 may be
reached on target.

5. Multiphoton ionization of Ar atoms

To demonstrate and investigate the utility of the focused XUV pulses for XUV nonlinear
optics, CDI and XUV pump - XUV probe experiments, we have studied multiphoton
ionization of Ar atoms, and observed the generation of ions with charge states up to Ar5+.
The spatial ion distributions along the XUV propagation direction (Fig. 3) are peaked
at the XUV focal plane and become narrower for more highly charged ions, which is a
signature of the higher orders of nonlinearity leading to the production of these ions.
We note that the absence of sidebands in the electron spectrum shown in Fig. 2(b)
demonstrates that the residual NIR light did not play a role in the ionization of Ar.
The spatially resolved measurements allow us to determine the relative contributions of

ions, where the horizontal axis refers to the XUV propagation axis and the vertical
axis refers to the transverse direction. Each ion distribution was normalized to its
maximal value. Note that the extension in the transverse direction is limited by the
spatial resolution of the imaging setup of about 50 µm. Note further that some noise
is visible in (d) due to the low signal level. (e) Relative ion contributions at the XUV

of Ar2+ (27.5 %), Ar3+ (19.5 %) and Ar4+ (3 %) ions as well as a small contribution of
Ar5+ (0.05 %) ions. These results are comparable to previously obtained FEL results [6].
Since it is not easily possible to measure the XUV beam waist radius when
using a spherical focusing mirror with a short focal length, we have instead made an
estimation based on the XUV beam size on the focusing mirror and an estimate of
the Rayleigh length zR making use of the longitudinal Ar2+ and Ar3+ ion distributions

the focus was used to calibrate the relative XUV intensities. Fits to the diﬀerent ion
species (solid curves) indicate orders of nonlinearities n of 1.8 ± 0.2 for Ar2+, 3.9 ± 0.2
for Ar3+ and 8.2 ± 0.9 for Ar4+. Note that the maximal XUV peak intensity in this
measurement was somewhat lower compared to the measurement shown in Fig. 3.

(solid curves in Fig. 3(f)). For this measurement, we have inserted a second Al ﬁlter
with a transmission of 16 % to avoid signiﬁcant depletion of the Ar2+ and Ar3+ ion
yields due to the formation of more highly charged ions. The transversely integrated
ion yield scales with I n(z) × w2(z) ∝ I n/I = I n−1, where I(z) ∝ 1/w2(z) is the

and w(z) = w0

Accordingly, the ion distributions are proportional to (1 + z2/z2
measurements of the intensity dependence of the ion yields (see below), the generation
of Ar2+ is described by an eﬀective nonlinearity of n = 2, while the generation of
Ar3+ is described by an eﬀective nonlinearity of n = 4. Fits using these orders of
nonlinearity are shown as dotted curves in Fig. 3(f), giving zR = 49 µm for the ﬁt
of the Ar2+ and zR = 58 µm for the ﬁt of the Ar3+ result. Therefore, we estimate
that zR = 54 ± 8 µm. The XUV beam radius on the MCP / phosphor screen was
measured to be 1.7 mm,
indicating an XUV beam radius wXU V,mirror = 1.8 mm
at the position of the XUV focusing mirror. The beam waist radius is estimated
according to w0 = wXU V,mirror(1 + f 2
R)−1/2 ≈ wXU V,mirrorzR/fXU V , giving a value
of 1.3±0.2 µm. Again, we point out that numerical calculations using the parameters of
our beamline [21] indicate a signiﬁcantly smaller XUV beam waist radius of 320 nm as
a result of reshaping of the driving pulses in the HHG cell. In our experiment, we would
not be able to resolve such a small focus size, which is associated with a Rayleigh of
only several micrometers [21], due to the limited spatial resolution of our setup of about
50 µm. We further note that the asymmetric behavior of the Ar2+ ion yield before and
after the focus observed in Fig. 3(a) may be a result of propagation eﬀects of the driving
laser in the HHG cell, which are described in detail in Ref. [21].

for Ar2+, n = 3.9 ± 0.2 for Ar3+ and n = 8.2 ± 0.9 for Ar4+, indicating that about 8
XUV photons are absorbed in the latter case. While we have not recorded intensity-
dependent data for Ar5+ due to the low signal, we estimate that 3-4 additional photons
are required to generate Ar5+ from the Ar4+ ground state, which has an ionization
potential of 74.8 eV [25]. From this consideration it follows that at least 10 HHG
photons are absorbed by a single photon.

In the production of these ions, both sequential and nonsequential absorption of
XUV photons may contribute. Since our photon energy range is below the ionization
potentials of more highly charged ions, absorption of XUV photons leading to the
formation of excited ions is expected to play an important role. The subsequent
absorption of an additional XUV photon may then lead to further ionization of these
excited ions. Nonsequential ionization following the simultaneous absorption of two
or more XUV photons is expected to become important at very short XUV pulse
durations [2]. Future XUV-XUV experiments will allow us to identify the roles that
are played by sequential and nonsequential ionization, since the latter will result in an
increased ion yield at the temporal overlap of the two XUV pulses.

We note that the production of ions up to Ar4+ was observed in a recent experiment
using HHG, in which XUV pulses with energies of up to 230 µJ were reported [12]. Our
ﬁndings demonstrate that we achieve a higher degree of ionization, although our XUV
pulse energy is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the pulse energy reported
in Ref. [12]. Our results therefore open a path for the investigation of highly nonlinear
processes in the XUV range using HHG sources that are driven by lasers with moderately
high pulse energies, which makes it feasible to perform these experiments using lasers
at kHz repetition rates in the future.

6. Summary

In summary, we have demonstrated the generation of XUV pulses by HHG reaching
intensities of at least 7 × 1014 W/cm2 on target using a novel scaling scheme. These
XUV pulses enable highly nonlinear ionization of Ar atoms up to Ar5+, following the
absorption of at least 10 XUV photons. Our results provide excellent opportunities
for XUV pump - XUV probe experiments and for the single-shot CDI of isolated
nanotargets.
