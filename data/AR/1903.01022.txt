Abstract 

Epitaxial  thin  film  fabrication  of  iron  oxides  including  magnetite  Fe3O4  and  epsilon-

ferrite 

-Fe2O3  with  the  potential  for  advancing  electromagnetic  devices  has  been 

investigated, which led to the first ever  -ferrite epitaxial layer being synthesized in the 

conventional sputtering process. Concerning Fe3O4 (100) / MgO (100) films, a cube-on-

cube epitaxial relationship and sharp rocking curves with FWHM of 50 - 350 arcsec were 

confirmed regardless of the small amount of Ge additions. Sputtering Ar gas pressure 

PAr  heavily  influenced  their  magnetic  and  transport  properties.  High  PAr  =  15  mTorr 

caused a high magnetization of 6.52 kG for the Ge added sample and the clear Verwey 

transition  at  122  K  for  the  non  Ge  addition  case.  Conversion  electron  Mössbauer 

spectroscopy (CEMS) measurements revealed that low PAr < 10 mTorr causes Fe/O off-

stoichiometry on the oxidizing side for the non Ge addition case and the reductive side 

for the Ge addition case, respectively. Regarding the  -Fe2O3 (001) / SrTiO3(111) epilayer 

synthesis,  bilayer  microstructure  composed  of  an  approximately  5nm  thick  initially 

grown 

-Fe2O3  (001)  epilayer  and  subsequently  grown 

-Fe2O3  (001)  epilayer  was 

confirmed from cross-sectional TEM observations. The coexistence of magnetically hard 

and  soft  phases  was  confirmed  from  the  magnetization  measurements.  As  a  possible 

application  of  the  single  nm  thick  -Fe2O3  layer,  4-resistive-state  multiferroic  tunnel 

junction (MFTJ) is considered.

Introduction 

Magnetic iron oxides, so-called "ferrites", have been utilized for various electromagnetic 

applications  due  to  their  versatile  magnetic  properties  [1,  2]  and  large  natural 

abundance of main constituent iron and oxygen, which meets recent social requirements 

for materials such as rare-metal-free ubiquity. Among the huge variety of ferrites, we 

focused on two iron oxides: magnetite Fe3O4 and epsilon ferrite  -Fe2O3, both of which 

show unique magnetic and electronic functionalities, and attempted to fabricate their 

epitaxially  grown  thin  films  by  conventional  sputtering,  which  is  an  advantageous 

process for industrial device applications. 

Magnetite of the first iron oxide is an ubiquitous magnetic material naturally found as 

the main component of iron sand [3]. Its crystal structure  is an  inverse spinel  that is 

composed of Fe3+ at tetrahedral A sites, Fe2+ and Fe3+ at octahedral B sites and oxygen 

sites. It has a room temperature saturation magnetization 4 M of 6.25 kG, which is the 

highest among iron oxides, and Curie temperature TC of 858 K [4]. Magnetite also shows 

characteristic  electronic  properties  of  half-metallicity  [5-8]  and  large  anomalous  Hall 

resistivity  H  ~10  -  40  μΩcm  [9],  which  is  comparable  with  Co  based  full  Heusler 

compounds [10], leading to the possibility for various spintronic devices such as magnetic 

tunnel  junctions  (MTJ).  Due  to  its  high  biocompatibility,  magnetite's  biomedical 

applications  such  as  hyperthermia  and  drug  delivery  system  (DDS)  have  also  been 

pursued [11]. To date, our research group conducted research on small-amount element 

additions  in  polycrystalline  magnetite  films  and  found  that  the  additions  of  some 

elements up to several percent, especially Ge, raised their thermal stability and caused 

an  increase  in  magnetization  [12,  13].  Since  the  effects  of  such  element  additions  in 

magnetite epifilms have not yet been confirmed, we studied the structural and magnetic 

3 

 
effects on small-amount Ge addition to magnetite epifilms in this research. 

Epsilon ferrite of the second iron oxide is an emerging hard magnetic material, which 

has an orthorhombic crystal structure with four iron sites for which magnetic moments 

are ferrimagnetically aligned [14]. From its high anisotropy field HA that comes from the 

high magnetic anisotropy constants of Ka = 7.7 x 106 erg/cc along the a axis and Kb = 1.2 

x 106 erg/cc along the b axis [15] and low magnetization value 4 MS = 1.26 kG (= 100 

emu/cm3) [16],  -ferrite shows high resonance frequencies fr of 35-222 GHz [17, 18] and 

high coercivities over 20 kOe [17, 19], leading to the possibility of milli-wave absorption 

device  and  magnetic  recording  media  applications.  It  also  shows  a  rare  room-

temperature multiferroicity that means simultaneous manifestation of ferromagnetism 

and ferroelectricity [16], which may have memory or sensor applications as indicated in 

the  last  part  of  this  paper.  Its  synthesis  is  difficult  due  to  the  characteristics  of  the 

metastable  phase.  Two  preparation  methods  available  have  been  proposed  for 

metastable 

-ferrite  so  far.  One  is  based  on  Gibb's  energy  minimum  of 

-ferrite 

nanoparticles  at  the  particle  diameters  of  8-30  nm  [17],  leading  to  the  availability  of 

chemical  syntheses  of  -ferrite  nanoparticles.  The  other  is  based  on  the  constraint  of 

crystal lattices accompanied by epigrowth on certain single-crystalline substrates, which 

has mainly been conducted for  -ferrite epifilms by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). A few 

single-crystalline  substrates  including  SrTiO3(111)  [16,  20],  YSZ(100)  [21]  and 

GaN(0001) [22, 23] have been reported for  the syntheses of  -ferrite epifilms by PLD. 

However, epifilm synthesis by conventional sputtering, which is important in industrial 

applications,  has  to  the  best  of  my  knowledge  not  yet  been  reported.  Therefore,  we 

attempted  -ferrite epifilm synthesis by RF magnetron sputtering. 

4 

 
 
Experimental 

Sample  preparations  for  both  magnetite  and 

-ferrite  epifilms  were  done  by  RF 

magnetron sputtering. The sputtering target for the magnetite epilayer was a magnetite 

composite  target  on  which  Ge  chips  were  regularly-arrayed  and  that  for  the  -ferrite 

epilayer was an  -Fe2O3 target, respectively. Single-crystalline substrates for epigrowth 

were  polished  MgO(100)  (Tateho  Chemical  Industries)  for  magnetite  epilayers  and 

polished  SrTiO3(111)  (Furuuchi  Chemical  Corp.)  for  -ferrite  epilayers,  both  of  which 

were  heated  up  to  800°C  during  deposition  after  evacuating  at  less  than  the  vacuum 

degree of 2 x 10-7 Torr. Sputtering gas species were pure Ar gas for magnetite epigrowth 

and Ar + O2 mixed gas with the O2 / (Ar +O2) flow ratio ranging from 25% to 50% for  -

ferrite  epigrowth,  respectively.  Sputtering  gas  pressures,  which  strongly  affect  film 

characteristics, were varied from 2 to 15 mTorr for magnetite epigrowth, and from 1 to 5 

mTorr for  -ferrite epigrowth, respectively. The film thicknesses for magnetite epilayers 

ranged from 0.481 m to 0.548 m, which were measured by DekTak 150 (Bruker). Ge 

compositions  in  magnetite  epilayers  were  evaluated  by  wavelength  dispersive  X-ray 

spectroscopy  WDS  (INCA  WAVE,  Oxford  Instruments).  Structural  analyses  were 

conducted using a high-precision X-ray diffractometer with a CuK radiation, LYNXEYE 

1-dimensional detector and Ge(220) monochromator (D8 DISCOVER, Bruker). The film 

thicknesses of 

/ -Fe2O3 bilayers were evaluated by X-ray reflectometry. Magnetization 

measurements  were  performed  by  a  superconducting  quantum  interference  device 

SQUID  (MPMS3,  Quantum  Design)  and  vibrating  sample  magnetometer  VSM 

(Tamakawa)  with  maximum  applied  fields  of  70  kOe  and  15  kOe,  respectively. 

Diamagnetic components that come from substrates and sample holders were subtracted 

from the raw magnetization data. Conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy (CEMS) 

5 

 
measurement was performed with a 57Co radiation embedded in a Rh matrix, constant-

acceleration spectrometer and He-1% (CH3)3CH gas-flow counter. Velocity correction was 

conducted  using 

-Fe.  No  57Fe  was  doped  in  the  samples  for  CEMS.  All  the 

measurements  were  performed  at  room  temperature.  Resistivity  measurements  were 

performed  by  the  4-point  method  using  PPMS  (Quantum  Design)  in  the  temperature 

range of 10 - 300K. Cross-sectional high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission 

electron  microscopy  (HAADF-STEM)  observation  (Z-contrast  image)  and  nano  beam 

electron diffraction (NBD) for the 

/ -Fe2O3 bilayer were conducted by JEM-ARM200F 

(200 kV, JEOL). 

Results and discussions for Fe3O4 epigrowth 

A typical θ/2θ scan XRD profile for the 0.6 at%Ge-Fe3O4 / MgO(100) epifilm is shown in 

Fig.  1.  Sharp  Fe3O4  (400)  and  Fe3O4  (800)  peaks  were  clearly  observed  close  to  the 

MgO(200) and MgO(400) peaks and no other phase was confirmed, which shows c-axis 

alignment of the magnetite phase in the direction normal to the film plane. In order to 

study the effect of sputtering gas pressure PAr on crystallinity of the magnetite epilayers, 

full-widths at half maximum (FWHM) of Fe3O4 (400) rocking curves with varying PAr are 

shown  in  Fig.  2  in  comparison  with  FWHM  of  MgO(200).  FWHM  of  the  magnetite 

epilayers was relatively low ranging from 50 to 350 arcsec, which is the same order of 

magnitude as those of compound semiconductor epifilms reported so far. The FWHM of 

magnetite epilayers for PAr ≤ 7 mTorr was lower than those for PAr ≥ 10 mTorr, indicating 

that  magnetite  epilayers  with  lower  PAr  ≤  7  mTorr  have  higher  crystallinity  than  the 

higher  PAr  ≥  10  mTorr  cases,  and  shows  almost  the  same  crystallinity  as  those  of 

MgO(200). Conventional θ/2θ scan XRD gives only structural information along the out-

6 

 
 
of-plane direction, and therefore we conducted Fe3O4(311) 

 scan XRD that contains its 

in-plane  information,  as  shown  in  Figs.3  (a)  and  (b).  Different  from  Fe3O4  (400), 

Fe3O4(311) is appropriate for   scan XRD since it is sufficiently separated from the MgO 

substrate spots in its reciprocal lattice space. Figure 3 (c) shows a simulated Fe3O4(311) 

pole figure with the   = 0° direction along Fe3O4 [100], of which the inner four spots and 

outer eight spots correspond to the four peaks in Fig. 3 (a) and the eight peaks in Fig.3 

(b),  respectively.  Reproduction  of  the  simulated  pole  figure  is  considered  to  show  the 

following cube-on-cube orientation relationships: Fe3O4[100] // MgO[100], Fe3O4[010] // 

MgO[010] and Fe3O4[001] // MgO[001]. 

We have studied room-temperature magnetic properties for the Fe3O4(100) / MgO(100) 

epifilms  varying  with  Ar  sputter  gas  pressure  PAr.  Magnetization  curves  for  PAr  =  15 

mTorr and PAr = 2 mTorr with the maximum field of 70 kOe are shown in Figs. 4 (a) and 

(b). Out-of-plane magnetizations for both PAr = 15 mTorr and 2 mTorr exceed the in-plane 

magnetizations  at  higher  fields  over  10  kOe,  which  suggests  the  existence  of  some 

perpendicular  magnetic  anisotropy.  This  large  perpendicular  anisotropy  has  been 

reported for magnetite epifilms and polycrystalline films [24, 25] so far and its possible 

origin  is  attributed  to  out-of-plane  moment  alignment  around  antiphase  boundaries 

(APB), which was confirmed by off-axis electron holography [26]. Figure 4 (c) summarizes 

out-of-plane magnetizations 4 M with the maximum applied fields of 15 kOe and 70 kOe 

for the Ge-doped and non-doped magnetite epifilms as a function of PAr. For both the Ge-

doped  and  non-doped  cases,  magnetizations  4 M  increase  with  the  increase  in  PAr. 

Moreover, the out-of-plane 4M for PAr = 15 mTorr is 6.52 kG, which exceeds the 6.25 kG 

for single crystal magnetite, at the applied field of 70 kOe and still does not saturate at 

70 kOe as shown in Figs.4 (a) and (b). Magnetization enhancement over 12 kG, which is 

7 

 
much larger than the bulk value of 6.25 kG, has been reported for 3nm thick magnetite 

epifilm, the possible origin of which has been attributed to spin flip from ferrimagnetic 

moment alignment to ferromagnetic type [4]. The same type of enhancement might occur 

partially for the epifilms as well. In this research, we grew magnetite epifilms at a high 

substrate temperature of 800°C and magnesium atoms easily diffuse into the magnetite 

layer [27, 28], leading to the possible formation of an interdiffused Mg-Fe3O4 layer. Thus, 

we conducted cross-sectional TEM observation and composition analysis along the out-

of-plane  direction,  which  confirmed  the  existence  of  a  ~100  nm  thick  Mg-Fe3O4 

interdiffused layer in the magnetite epifilm with a total thickness of ~500 nm. Mg ferrite 

MgFe2O4 has 4 M of 1.149 kG [29], which is much lower than that of the 6.25 kG for 

magnetite,  and  so  the  interdiffused  layer  is  considered  to  cause  a  magnetization 

reduction.  Since  a  slight  magnetization  enhancement  was  observed  for  the  magnetite 

epilayer with PAr = 15 mTorr as described above despite the existence of the interdiffused 

layer, the magnetization enhancement at the undiffused part of  magnetite epilayer is 

considered  to  be  large  enough  to  compensate  the  magnetization  reduction  at  the  Mg 

interdiffused part. 

In  order  to  study  the  Verwey  transition,  which  is  sensitive  to  the  film  quality  and 

stoichiometry [30], we performed resistance measurements of the (a) Ge-doped and (b) 

non-doped magnetite epifilms with PAr = 10 and 15 mTorr as a function of the inverse 

number of temperature 1000/T as shown in Fig. 5. The non-doped magnetite epifilms 

show  the  clear  resistivity  change  accompanied  with  the  Verwey  transition.  The 

transition temperature TV for PAr = 15 mTorr is 122 K, almost the same as the previously 

reported value of bulk magnetite. On the contrary, resistivity changes for the Ge-doped 

samples are diminished and their TV's decrease until < 100 K. Since the Ge addition also 

8 

 
increases the resistivity, the added Ge might be incorporated into B sites with two types 

of valency and inhibit the hopping conduction. Regardless of the Ge concentrations, we 

could not observe clear resistivity changes of the Verwey transition for the samples with 

PAr < 10 mTorr, the magnetizations of which are low as shown in Fig. 4(c). 

For further investigation of magnetism in the magnetite epifilms, we performed CEMS 

measurements. CEMS spectra for the Ge-added magnetite epifilms are shown in Fig.6 

(a) PAr = 15 mTorr (0.4 at%Ge) and (b) PAr = 2 mTorr (1.6 at%Ge). The observed spectra 

can be decomposed into two sharp ferromagnetic sextets that come from tetrahedral A 

(Fe3+) and octahedral B (Fe2.5+) sites. Hyperfine structure parameters, BHf,  MB integral 

intensities for A and B sites and sextet intensity ratios x for the Ge-added  magnetite 

epifilms  are  summarized  in  Table  1  in  comparison  with  those  of  previously  reported 

sputtered magnetite epifilms and natural bulk magnetite [31, 32]. The parameters for 

the PAr = 15 mTorr sample are in good agreement with those of the previously reported 

film and bulk magnetite. BHf and integral intensities for the PAr = 2 mTorr sample, which 

has  lower  magnetization  4 M  than  the  PAr  =  15  mTorr  sample,  deviate  from  the 

previously reported values. Sextet intensity ratio x contains information about moment 

direction according to the following Eq.:  𝑥 =   4 sin 2𝜃 (1 + cos 2𝜃)

⁄

, where θ stands for the 

angle  between  57Fe  magnetic  moment  and  the  incident  direction  of  γ-ray  for  CEMS. 

States for x = 0 and x = 4 mean moment alignments along the out-of-plane and the in-

plane directions, respectively. State for x = 2 means randomly-oriented or <111> oriented 

moments. From x < 2 for both the PAr = 15 mTorr and 2 mTorr samples, the samples show 

some  perpendicular  magnetic  anisotropy,  which  coincides  with  the  feature  of 

magnetization curves in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). Integral intensity ratios for A and B sites in 

CEMS  contain  information  about  iron  vacancy  in  magnetite.  Vacancy  parameter

=  0  and 

  =  1/3  correspond  to  stoichiometric  magnetite  and  stoichiometric  γ-Fe2O3, 

respectively. If we take account of the effect of the recoilless fraction, a slight correction 

to  the  oxidizing  side  from  β  =  0.5  (   =  0)  to β  =  0.52  (   =  4.9  x  10-3)  is  required  for 

stoichiometric magnetite [34]. Figures 7 (a) and (b) show   and 4 M at 15 kOe for Ge-

doped and non-doped MNT epifilms  as  a function of PAr. With the increase in PAr, 

's 

approach zero for both the Ge-doped and non-doped samples, which corresponds to the 

increase in 4 M. Therefore, the 4 M reduction with the decrease in PAr is considered to 

be due to the composition deviation from the stoichiometry of magnetite. The vanishing 

of resistivity change at the Verwey transition with the decrease in PAr described in the 

previous  part  of Fig.  5  is  considered  to  be  the same  as  well,  and so  Fe/O  composition 

deviation is considered to significantly influence the magnetic and transport properties 

of magnetite. 

Results and discussions for  / -Fe2O3 bilayer epigrowth 

Research on epigrowth of  -ferrite so far has been mainly focused on the PLD process 

and the conditions necessary for its epigrowth have been reported to be a high substrate 

temperature and high oxygen content atmosphere during deposition [16, 20-23]. Thus, 

we conducted sputtered epigrowth deposition at the high substrate temperature of 800ºC 

with a varying oxygen flow rate ratio Q(O2)/Q(Ar+O2). For the no oxygen atmospheric 

condition, the Fe3O4(111) epilayer was grown despite the use of the Fe2O3 sputter target 

and  found  that  -ferrite  epilayers  can  be  grown  in  a  high  oxygen  content  atmosphere 

such as the PLD cases as shown below. This study is the first to report of  -ferrite epilayer 

10 

 
 
 
growth  by  conventional  sputtering  process.  XRD  profiles  for  the  Fe2O3  epifilms  with 

Q(O2)/Q(Ar+O2) = 25 % and different sputter gas pressures are shown in Figs.8 (a), (b) 

and (c). A c-axis oriented  -ferrite epilayer was confirmed only for the lowest gas pressure 

of a 1 mTorr sample and the higher gas pressure conditions of 2 and 5 mTorr create  -

phase  epilayers.  Low  sputter  gas  pressure  causes  long  mean  free  paths  of  sputter 

particles,  leading  to  high  kinetic  energies,  less  collisions  and  low  sputter  particle 

incorporation into the films, which may influence the different phase formation in the 

epilayers.  The  prepared  film  samples  on  10  mm  square  SrTiO3(111)  substrates  were 

composed of two different parts of the dark-colored and light-colored areas as shown in 

the optical images of Fig. 9. From XRD with narrowed X-ray beams, the dark-colored 

and  light-colored  areas  are  composed  of  the  c-axis  oriented 

-phase  and 

-phase, 

respectively. X-ray reflectometry with collimated beams shows that the thicknesses of 

the dark-colored and light-colored areas are 29 nm and 4 nm, respectively. 

In order to clarify the microstructure of the epilayer, we conducted cross-sectional TEM 

observations on the  dark-colored area of  the epifilm  with  Q(O2)/Q(Ar+O2) =  40 %  and 

sputter  gas  pressure  P(Ar+O2)=  1  mTorr.  Figure  10  shows  cross-sectional  TEM 

observation and NBD in the epifilm. It was revealed that the epifilm was composed of 

two phase construction where one is   phase of the initial epilayer on the substrate with 

~ 5 nm thick and the other is  -phase of the capped epilayer. From the NBD of Fig. 10 

(b),  both  the  -  and 

-phase  epilayers  were  aligned  with  [001]  along  the  out-of-plane 

direction  and  [-210]  along  the  in-plane  direction.  The  initial 

-phase  epilayer  is 

continuous  in  this  image,  however,  discontinuous  areas  were  also  found to  exist  from 

larger area TEM observations. Since a clear lattice image was confirmed in Fig.10, we 

also conducted HAADF-STEM observation with higher magnification as shown in Fig. 

11 

 
11. Within the scope of our TEM observation, no crystalline boundaries were confirmed 

in the  -phase epilayer though some disorder of atomic arrangement was observed, which 

is different from the case of the previously reported -phase epilayer prepared by PLD. 

It has been reported that PLD can create a thicker c-axis oriented  -phase epilayer up to 

about 100nm thick and the PLD epilayer is composed of nano-sized crystal domains with 

the  in-plane  crystal  orientation  of  six-fold  symmetry  [20].  -ferrite  has  been  mainly 

studied within the form of nanoparticles and its phase formation is explained by free 

energy minimum at the diameters of 8-30nm [17]. However, other forms of epitaxially 

grown 

-ferrite  have  also  been  reported  such  as  nanowire  or  nanobelt  several 

micrometers in length by PLD [35, 36] and peculiar dendritic microstructures of mullite 

on the scale of several micrometers in Japanese stoneware, Bizen-yaki [37, 38]. Therefore, 

further study is considered to be necessary regarding the generation mechanism of  -

ferrite. 

Room-temperature  magnetic  properties  of  the  two  phase 

/ -Fe2O3  epilayer  with 

different total thicknesses were investigated as shown in Fig. 11. The hysteresis curves 

show that the sample was composed of decoupled magnetically soft and hard phases. The 

hard phase comes from original hard  -ferrite and the soft phase comes from  -ferrite in 

which magnetic anisotropy was diminished by some imperfections of crystallinity since 

no  other  magnetic  phase  could  be  confirmed.  The  magnetization  values  obtained  by 

assuming 5 nm thick  -ferrite epilayers had mostly good agreement with the reported 

value of 1.26 kG in  -ferrite by the same order of magnitude, which is consistent with the 

above TEM observation results. 

As a possible application of such single nm-scale  -ferrite epilayer, it may be applied to 

the multiferroic barrier in multiferroic tunnel junction (MFTJ). Spin filter MFTJ with 

12 

 
half-metallic and multiferroic perovskite oxides was firstly reported by a French group 

in  2007  as  a  prototype  of  the  4-resistive-state  memory  that  utilizes  both  tunnel 

magnetoresistance (TMR) and tunnel electroresistance (TER) effects [39, 40]. 4-resistive 

states  in  MFTJ  correspond  to  the  configurations  of  magnetic  moment  M  and  electric 

polarization P as shown in Fig. 12. Because the high-temperature phase of magnetite 

and  -ferrite shows half-metallicity and multiferroicity at room temperature, respectively, 

we  anticipated  that  all  ferrite  MFTJ  would  work  at  room-temperature  if  it  were 

composed of a magnetite electrode and  -ferrite barrier as shown in Fig. 12. In order to 

secure the independent switching function of 4-state memory, ME coupling between M 

and  P  in  the  multiferroic  barrier  should  not  be  strong  and  so  the  clarification  of 

magnitude of ME coupling in  -ferrite is required. A study on optical ME coupling in  -

ferrite utilizing its second harmonic generation SHG effect showed that it has a strong 

ME coupling from the magnetic component of SHG [15], thus it might be necessary to 

control the magnitude of coupling by measures such as some element additions in order 

to realize 4-resistive-state magnetite /  -ferrite MFTJ. 

Summary 

Epitaxial  growth  of  magnetite  and 

-ferrite  was  conducted  by  conventional  RF 

magnetron  sputtering  on  MgO(100)  and  SrTiO3(111),  respectively.  Fe3O4  /  MgO(100) 

epifilms  have  a  cube-on-cube  epitaxial  relationship  and  a  high  crystallinity  was 

confirmed from the sharp rocking curves with FWHM of 50 - 350 arcsec for both the Ge-

added and non Ge addition cases. Sputtering Ar gas pressure PAr significantly influenced 

their magnetic and transport properties. The magnetite epifilm for PAr = 15 mTorr had a 

high magnetization of 6.52 kG for the Ge added case and the clear Verwey transition at 

13 

 
 
122 K for the non Ge addition case. CEMS measurements revealed that low PAr < 10 

mTorr causes Fe/O off-stoichiometry on the oxidizing side for the non Ge addition case 

and the reductive side for the Ge addition case, respectively. 

Regarding 

-Fe2O3  epilayer  synthesis,  bilayer  microstructure  composed  of  an 

approximately  5nm  thick  -Fe2O3  (001)  epilayer  initially  grown  on  SrTiO3(111)  and  a 

subsequently  grown 

-Fe2O3  (001)  epilayer  was  confirmed  from  cross-sectional  TEM 

observations. The coexistence of magnetically hard and soft phases was confirmed from 

the  magnetization  measurements.  As  a  possible  application  of  the  single  nm  thick  -

Fe2O3 layer, 4-resistive-state multiferroic tunnel junction (MFTJ) could be considered.
