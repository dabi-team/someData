ABSTRACT
Using the photospheric magnetic and coronal observations of Solar Dynamics Observatory, we stud-
ied the build-up and eruption of coronal non-potential magnetic structure in emerging active region
(AR) 12673. The velocity ﬁeld derived from tracked vector-magnetograms indicates persistent shear
and converging motions of ﬂux regions about the polarity inversion line (PIL). A major helicity injec-
tion occurs during rapid ﬂux emergence consistent with the very fast ﬂux emergence phase. While this
helicity ﬂux builds-up the sigmoid by September 4, the helicity injection by the continued shear and
converging motions in the later evolution contributes to sigmoid sustenance and its core ﬁeld twist
as a manifestation of the ﬂux rope which erupts after exceeding critical value of twist. Moreover,
the total length of sheared PIL segments correlates with the non-neutralized current and maintains a
higher value in both the polarity regions as a signature of eruptive capability of the AR according to
the ﬂux rope models. The modelled magnetic ﬁeld qualitatively reproduces the sigmoidal structure
capturing major features like twisted core ﬂux as ﬂux rope, and hook-shaped parts connecting at the
middle of the PIL. Study of quasi-separatrix-layers reveals that the sheared arcade, enclosing the ﬂux
rope, is stressed to a critically stable state and its coronal height becomes doubled from September
4-6. While demonstrating the fast injection of helicity per unit ﬂux as the crucial factor for severe
space-weather events, this study explains the formation of the ﬂux rope and recurrent eruptive nature
of the AR by the critically stable state of sheared arcade early on September 6.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Sun often produces major eruptive phenomena
that release vast amount of energy on the order of 1032
erg in a few seconds to minutes. It is now accepted that
the source of energy for all of this solar activity is from
magnetic ﬁelds. Active regions (ARs) are higher concen-
trations of magnetic ﬁeld regions often seen with violent
activity, like jets, ﬂares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
etc. The occurrence of these events relies on the infor-
mation of triggering and driving mechanisms. Even after
large number of studies, not only the onset mechanism
but also the supply mechanism of magnetic free energy
is not yet clariﬁed. Theoretically speaking, there are two
eﬀects that can supply magnetic free energy and mag-
netic helicity from below the solar surface to the corona.
One is the so-called ﬂux emergence activity, in which ver-
tical motion carries magnetic ﬂuxes through the photo-
sphere. If the emerging ﬂux has magnetic helicity, it must
work as a helicity injection and may eﬃciently supply
free energy into the solar corona. Another mechanism is
photospheric shear motion, which supplies magnetic free
energy as well as magnetic helicity into the solar corona
by generating magnetic shear in the coronal ﬁeld. Thus,
triggering of CMEs, ﬂares has mostly concentrated on
the problem of evolution of a magnetic ﬁeld in the very
tenuous highly conducting plasma of solar corona (Forbes
& Priest 1995; Lin & Forbes 2000; Lin et al. 2003; Forbes
et al. 2006).

Previous studies demonstrated various types of mech-
anisms that contribute dominantly to the accumulation

vemareddy@iiap.res.in

of free magnetic energy in the solar atmosphere. These
are 1) magnetic ﬂux emergence or cancellation (Zhang
1995; Chen & Shibata 2000; Zhang 2001; Sterling et al.
2010), (2) shearing motion (Ambastha et al. 1993; Zhang
1995; D´emoulin et al. 2002; Vemareddy et al. 2012b; Ve-
mareddy 2017) (3) sunspot rotation (Brown et al. 2003;
Tian & Alexander 2006; Yan et al. 2008; Vemareddy
et al. 2012a; T¨or¨ok et al. 2013; Vemareddy et al. 2016).
The AR 9236 was reported to produce recurrent CMEs
at an average time period of 10 hr (Gopalswamy et al.
2005) and the associated ﬂares were not long decay events
(LDEs). Report of the same AR by (Nitta & Hudson
2001) suggested the emerging magnetic ﬂux as being re-
sponsible for repeated CMEs. Some studies also showed
successive CMEs (e.g., AR 8038, 12371) in a timescale
comparable to energy buildup by foot point motions.
These were decaying ARs where the prolonged ﬂux can-
cellation by converging motions and subsequent magnetic
gradient increase about the polarity inversion line (PIL),
introduce energy build-up in the AR magnetic system,
which erupts into CMEs/ﬂares (Mathew & Ambastha
2000; Li et al. 2004, 2010; Vemareddy 2017; Vemareddy
& Dem´oulin 2018b). In the AR 12158, the two successive
CME eruptions were triggered by helical-kink instability
under the driving conditions of predominant sunspot ro-
tation in a timescale of days (Vemareddy et al. 2016).
Some ARs present with a combination of mechanisms in
action. For example, recent reports on AR 11158 suggest
that the shear and rotational motions of the observed
ﬂuxes played a signiﬁcant role in transient activity with
ﬂares and CMEs (Sun et al. 2012a; Vemareddy et al.
2012a). Based on these mechanisms, the eruptive sce-

nario of ARs under a particular evolving condition of
boundary motion have been numerically modelled (An-
tiochos et al. 1999; Amari et al. 2003a, 2010; Archontis
et al. 2014). All of these models are based on the phys-
ical concept that the foot point motions predominantly
contribute to a coronal helicity budget to form a twisted
ﬂux rope (FR) during or before its ejection as CME.

The magnetic helicity describes the magnetic ﬁeld com-
plexity, including the twist, writhe, knot, and linkages of
magnetic ﬁeld. When coronal magnetic ﬁeld is being
pumped with helicity and energy, the magnetic complex-
ity and non-potentiality increases. Conventionally, the
magnetic complexity and non-potentiality are described
in terms of parameters such as the magnetic shear (Hag-
yard & Rabin 1986; Wang et al. 1994), horizontal gra-
dient of longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld(Falconer et al. 2003;
Song et al. 2006), electric current (Leka et al. 1996; Wang
et al. 1994), twist parameter α (Pevtsov et al. 1994;
Hagino & Sakurai 2004; Tiwari et al. 2009), magnetic
free energy (Metcalf et al. 2005), current helicity (Abra-
menko et al. 1996; Zhang & Bao 1999), etc. On the other
hand, the EUV observations of the corona is seen with
sigmoidal structures, a form of twisted ﬂux rope associ-
ated with large-scale electric currents. From several such
above studies of simultaneous magnetic ﬁeld and coronal
observations, it is now believed that the magnetic ﬂux
rope is built up by the line-tied photospheric motions,
such as the magnetic ﬂux emergence or the horizontal
ﬂows which injects the magnetic helicity into the higher
solar atmosphere increasing the twist and kink of a ﬂux
rope (self-helicity) and the linkage between diﬀerent ﬂux
ropes (mutual helicity). The magnetic helicity is con-
served in an ideal MHD process and changes very slowly
in a resistive process (Taylor 1974). Thus, a ﬂux rope
with continuous injection of magnetic helicity inevitably
erupts to remove the accumulated helicity, a manifesta-
tion of the CME. In this way, the magnetic helicity in the
3D volume is just a result of the helicity ﬂux ﬂowing into
and out of the surface. Guo et al. (2013), for the ﬁrst
time, found a quantitative relationship between the he-
licity injection and the twist number of the MFR. Thus a
better understanding of the solar eruptions, on one hand,
requires the unravelling the magnetic conﬁguration for
the ﬂux rope, and the mechanism for the energy storage
on the other hand. This kind of study helps in revealing
the connections of the nature of boundary evolution and
ﬂux rope formation.

From the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) point of view,
the ﬂux rope is in equilibrium under the balance of mag-
netic pressure in the ﬂux rope and the magnetic tension
of the overlying magnetic ﬁeld. If the twist number in-
creases to some critical value, then kink instability would
occur (Hood & Priest 1979; T¨or¨ok et al. 2004). On the
other hand, if the decay index of the background ﬁeld,
in which the MFR is embedded, is larger than some crit-
ical value, torus instability can occur (Kliem & T¨or¨ok
2006; Aulanier et al. 2010; D´emoulin & Aulanier 2010).
D´emoulin & Aulanier (2010) pointed out that the loss
of equilibrium and the torus instability are two diﬀer-
ent views of the same physical mechanism, which is the
Lorentz repulsion force of electric currents with diﬀerent
paths. In addition to the role play in the ﬂux rope forma-
tion, the ﬂux cancellation and tether cutting reconnec-
tion have also been invoked to account for the triggering

the loss of equilibrium of the ﬂux rope (van Ballegooijen
& Martens 1989; Moore et al. 2001; Amari et al. 2003a,b).
Because lack of direct routine observations of the coro-
nal magnetic ﬁeld, the extrapolation of observed photo-
spheric ﬁeld by force-free ﬁeld approximation is typically
used for the study of the AR magnetic structure (Wiegel-
mann et al. 2012). The force-free model to the coronal
ﬁeld is justiﬁed by the low-β plasma and higher (several
hundred km/s) Alfven speed compared to photospheric
ﬂow speed. With this model, the coronal ﬁeld evolution,
corresponding to the slow photospheric plasma motion,
is approximated as a quasi-static evolution of force-free
equilibria. This enables one to study the buildup of pre-
eruptive 3D structure, like a sigmoid or ﬂux rope, then
to ﬁnd hints of the most appropriate conﬁgurations lead-
ing to eruptions (e.g., Savcheva et al. 2012b; Sun et al.
2012b; Guo et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2014; Vemareddy &
Wiegelmann 2014; Vemareddy et al. 2016; Vemareddy &
Dem´oulin 2018b).

The structure of the magnetic ﬁeld is usually char-
acterized by the topological analysis of quasi-separatrix
layers (QSLs) which denotes the places where the mag-
netic ﬁeld line connectivity changes dramatically (Priest
& D´emoulin 1995; Demoulin et al. 1996; Titov et al.
2002). Two important QSL shapes are found to have
relationship with the pre-eruptive conﬁguration. The
bald patch separatrix surface (BPSS) is separatrix sur-
face with ﬁeld lines touching the photosphere along PIL
section where the transverse magnetic ﬁelds cross from
negative to positive polarity as opposed to potential ﬁeld
case. The BPSS forms typically in cancelling and con-
verging ﬂux regions in the process of ﬂux rope formation
and has sigmoidal shape viewed from above. Hyperbolic
ﬂux tube (HFT) is another QSL structure with an X-
line conﬁguration that forms underneath the rising ﬂux
rope of BPSS topology. Alternatively, the HFT struc-
ture also forms above the ﬂux rope or shared arcade fa-
cilitating breakout reconnection (Antiochos et al. 1999)
in a quadrupolar magnetic conﬁguration.
In this case,
the overlying ﬂux contains a coronal null point which is
possibly formed by a new ﬂux emerging into an inverse
pre-existing ﬁeld (Wu et al. 2005; T¨or¨ok et al. 2009).

In this manuscript, we studied the most violent AR
12673 producing strongest ﬂares in the 24th solar cy-
cle. Previous studies of this AR focused on qualitative
energy supply mechanisms and triggering of major erup-
tions (Yang et al. 2017; Verma 2018; Yan et al. 2018; Hou
et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018). While the supply mecha-
nism of energy and helicity is of prime importance, it is
also very crucial to understand the rate at which they
store in the corona to seek any relation to severe activ-
ity. This will be examined through a comparison with
other ARs of various degree of activity in the form of
strong ﬂares/CMEs. Further, in order to establish the
connection of the helicity ﬂux injection with the coronal
ﬁeld conﬁguration like ﬂux rope topology, we also stud-
ied the coronal ﬁeld evolution by force-free extrapolation
of the observed photospheric magnetic ﬁeld. To this end,
we estimate the key parameters like QSL, twist number,
relative magnetic helicity, and total energy at diﬀerent
epochs of time evolution. In section 2, observations and
overview of the AR is presented. Details of the results
are given in Section 3. Summary of the results with a

2. OBSERVATIONS AND OVERVIEW
In this study, we use vector magnetic ﬁeld observations
at a 12 minute cadence and 0(cid:48)(cid:48).5 per pixel obtained from
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al.
2012) aboard Solar Dynamics observatory (SDO; Pesnell
et al. 2012). Details of retrieving vector ﬁeld from stokes
vectors of ﬁltergrams and other related information
about HMI data products can be referred in Hoeksema
et al. (2014); Bobra et al. (2014). These disambiguated
vector observations of the AR patch in the native co-
ordinate system (latitude, longitude) are remapped to
disk center by cylindrical equal area (CEA) projection
method such that the AR patch center matches the

disk center and are provided as hmi.sharp cea 720s
data product. The data product contains essentially
(Bz, −By, Bx) in the local heliographic coordinate sys-
tem (see the appendix section in Sun 2013). Supporting
coronal imaging observations are obtained from Atmo-
spheric Imaging Assembly (Lemen et al. 2012) at a ca-
dence of 12 s and 0(cid:48)(cid:48).6 per pixel.

In Figure 1 (ﬁrst row), the HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld
observations of AR 12673 are displayed. The corre-
sponding coronal observations in AIA 304 ˚A , 131 ˚A are
also shown in the second and third row panels. AR
12673 starts emerging from September 2 at disk posi-
tion E11S08 into pre-existing positive sunspot polarity
(SP). As described by Yang et al. (2017, Figure 1), the
emergence on September 3 is through two bipolar regions

nearby a pre-existing sunspot of positive polarity. During
this time, the coronal images of AIA 304 ˚A , 131 ˚A pass
bands indicate simple magnetic structure as seen in Fig-
ure 1. Following this on September 4, another two dipoles
emerged within the existing patches. Notably, the ﬁrst
pair of the dipolar regions separated in east-west direc-
tions, whereas the later pair along north-south direction
(Hou et al. 2018). The proper and shear motion of these
emerging patches was interacted by the pre-existing spot
and formed a large sheared main PIL. For convenience,
we labelled the prominent polarity patches as P1, P2, N1,
N2, N3 in Figure 1. These polarities are overally sepa-
rated by a PIL of semi-circular shape. By September 4,
the coronal images show an inverse-S sigmoidal structure
(bent shape at the middle) with two hook shapes joining

at the middle of main PIL between N1, P1.

3.1. Magnetic evolution
3.1.1. Shearing and converging motion
From the time series (every 12 minutes) vector mag-
netic ﬁeld data, we derived the vector velocity ﬁeld by
using DAVE4VM (Schuck 2008). In Figure 2, we plot the
horizontal velocity (arrows) on Bz map. Contours of 100
G are also overlaid to identify a polarity patch boundary.
Diﬀerent features move with diﬀerent velocity at diﬀer-
ent epochs, where the velocity is spread up to a maxi-
mum value of 0.8 km s−1. For a large scale ﬂow patter,
we have averaged the velocity maps for over 2 hours (10
time shots), which then reduces the ﬂow velocity to 0.4

km s−1. The velocity ﬁeld in N1 is coherent with a net
organized ﬂow pattern in northward, whereas that in P1
is southeast. Anti-clockwise whirl-pool motion pattern
is also seen that is consistent with the sunspot rotation
of N3, N1 and P2 which were reported to play major
role in triggering two major eruptions on September 6,
2017 (Yan et al. 2018). However, these sunspot rota-
tions are smaller in spatial and time scales compared to
large fraction of ﬂux involved in shear motion about the
mail PIL over entire evolution period. Therefore, these
motions indicate a predominant shearing and converging
motion of N1 and P1 over the entire evolution time and is
suggested to play prime role in energy and helicity stor-
age in the magnetic system. Consequently, the sigmoidal
structure builds as seen in corona after a day of the AR
emergence and is persisted for days through the continu-
ous helicity and energy input by these motions as earlier
studied cases for example Vemareddy (2017). These ob-
servations are consistent with (Verma 2018) linking the
shear ﬂows and head-on collision of new and pre-existing
ﬂux with the origin of two X-class ﬂares.

3.1.2. Net magnetic ﬂux
In Figure 3, we plot evolution of magnetic parameters
related to build-up of non-potential nature of the AR. A
rapid emergence commenced early on September 3 grow-
ing sunspot groups and forming full AR in a time of a
day. In Figure 3(a), net ﬂux in positive (Bz > 0) and
negative (Bz < 0) polarities are plotted with time. Disk
integrated GOES X-ray ﬂux is also shown in the same
panel with y-axis scale on right side. From September
4 to September 10, the AR produced a total 4 X-class
ﬂares, 27 M-class ﬂares and a multiple of small ﬂares
(Yang et al. 2017). From this GOES X-ray light curve,
we can divide the ﬂaring activity into two phases as in-
dicated by orange shades. The ﬁrst phase starts from
early September 4 and ends on September 5 at around
18:00 UT. This phase correlates with the ﬂux emergence
and includes M-class ﬂares. The second phase starts from
11:00 UT on September 6 and continues till September
10. This phase is the most energetic with the largest
X-class ﬂares in solar cycle 24. The net ﬂux varies 2–
10×1021 Mx in each polarity on September 3rd, due to
rapid emergence of ﬂux. The later evolution follows grad-
ual ﬂux emergence and its areal spreading, increasing the
net ﬂux to 34×1021 Mx till end of September 8. As found
in preliminary study of Sun & Norton (2017), the AR has
the fastest ﬂux emergence of any observed values at an
average of 4.93 × 1020 Mx hr−1 over 5-day period.

3.1.3. Net electric current and SPILs
While growing, the interaction of opposite polarity re-
gions creates compact regions forming sheared polarity
inversion lines (SPILs) at their interface. The opposite
motion of polarity regions parallel to PIL is referred to
shear motion and generates stress in magnetic ﬁeld con-
necting those regions.
In that case, the adjacent ﬁeld
vectors are parallel to PIL, and the extent of the shear
is measured by θ = cos−1(Bo · Bp/|Bo||Bp|), (Ambastha
et al. 1993) where Bo is the observed ﬁeld and Bp is the
potential ﬁeld. Thus, sheared PIL (SPIL) is a measure
of stressed magnetic conﬁguration in the AR. In Fig-
ure 1, the HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld observations of AR
12673 are displayed. We also traced the sheared PILs

component

by an automated procedure similar to the one applied
for tracing PILs of strong vertical ﬁeld gradients (Ma-
son & Hoeksema 2010) and applied in a statistical study
(Vasantharaju et al. 2018). In this procedure, we smooth
the Bz map to a smoothing factor of 8 pixels (4 arcsecs)
and identiﬁed the zero Gauss contour with shear angle
greater than 45◦. The value of SPIL length is slightly
dependent on degree of smoothness. The error in the
SPIL length is estimated by varying smoothing factor,
and could be upto 3-5 Mm. The maps are overplotted
with these traced SPIL segments.
It is indicated that
with the emergence of the AR, the interaction of oppo-
site polarities increased the interface of SPILs between
P1 and N1.

ing horizontal ﬁeld gradings and is readily computed with
vector ﬁeld observations. In Figure 3(b), the net current

(Jz)idA, where dA is area of the pixel) obtained
N
in each polarity is plotted with time. A threshold of
|B| > 150 G is used for the reliability of the values above
sensitivity, noise, inversion errors. The I increases with
the emergence of the AR on September 3, and reaches
to 5 × 1012 A in magnitude in each polarity by the end
of that day. The later evolution follows its further in-
crease reaching a maximum value of 13 × 1012 A around
12:00 UT on September 6, when a major eruption with
X9.2 ﬂare occurred. Note that the I is negative (pos-
itive) in positive (negative) polarity, indicating a dom-
inant negative chirality of the AR magnetic structure
according to the deﬁnition of current helicity.

In a magnetic polarity, the net current is theorized to
be neutralized by canceling volume and sheath currents
of the ﬂux tubes (Parker 1996), which is found to nearly
valid in isolated sunspot ARs (Venkatakrishnan & Ti-
wari 2009). However, when interacting opposite polar-
ities with SPILs exists, the net current breaks neutral-
ization (Georgoulis et al. 2012). According to the ﬂux
rope models of CMEs eruptions (Zakharov & Shafranov
1986), the breakdown of net current neutralization refers
to a form of Lorentz force development and stability loss.
As a reason, breakdown of neutrality is proposed to be
a proxy assessing the ability of ARs to produce major
eruptions (Liu et al. 2017). Following this, breakdown of
net current neutralization is found to be correlated with
the presence of SPILs and the observed activity in many
ARs (Vemareddy 2019).

currents, in each polarity is plotted with time. HMI pro-
vides inversion errors of ﬁeld vectors which vary upto 50
G. On considering an average error of δBx = δBy = 40
G in a typical distribution of n = 104 pixels, we found
that the range of uncertainty (
n × δJzdxdx) of a signed
net current in a given polarity can never be larger than
0.1 × 1012A (Vemareddy 2017, 2019) . Here dx is HMI
pixel size of 0(cid:48)(cid:48).5 Therefore, our estimation of |DC/RC|
can have a maximum error limit of 0.14, and is very
small compared to the range of |DC/RC| evolution in
CME and ﬂare producing ARs.

neutrality (T¨or¨ok et al. 2014). We can notice that neu-
trality breaks down with the emergence of the ﬂux from
3rd September onward and reached to 1.4 by the end of
the day. After the fast emergence phase, the |DC/RC|
varies about 1.5 in the later phase of evolution till 8th
September.
Importantly, the |DC/RC| follows the to-
tal length of all SPIL segments plotted in the same panel
with y-axis scale on right. This also substantiates for the
relevance of SPIL amid the compact regions in the ARs
and the breakdown of net current neutrality (Georgoulis
et al. 2012). Breakdown mainly occurs in the rapid emer-
gence phase, restoring to neutrality in the later phase
during which the ﬂux regions separate and become iso-
lated without SPILs. Unlike the case in emerging ARs
(Vemareddy 2019), the persistent higher degree of non-
neutrality of net electric current throughout the evolu-
tion is an indicator of eruptive capability of this AR.

3.1.4. Pumping of magnetic helicity and energy
While the AR ﬂux emerges and spreads through
plasma motions, the rate of build up of complexity is
measured by the helicity ﬂux injection through the pho-
tospheric surface of the AR given by (Berger & Field
1984)

where Ap is the vector potential of the potential ﬁeld
Bp, Bt and Bn denote the tangential and normal mag-
netic ﬁelds, and V⊥t and V⊥n are the tangential and
normal components of velocity V⊥, the velocity perpen-
dicular to the magnetic ﬁeld lines. From the time se-
ries (every 12 minutes) vector magnetic ﬁeld data, we
derived the vector velocity ﬁeld by using DAVE4VM
(Schuck 2008) and compute dH/dt (see also Liu & Schuck
2012; Vemareddy 2015). Although there is no way that
we can actually compute errors, a Monte Carlo experi-
ment is used to represent probable error in helicity ﬂux
computation. Here we randomly added noise of mag-
nitude 100 Gauss to three components of the vector
magnetic ﬁeld, and repeated the vector velocity and he-
licity ﬂux computations for 200 times (Liu & Schuck
2012). The maximum error is 1σ error of all 200 ex-
periments and was found to be 23%. To represent the
average complexity per ﬂux tube (twist rate), we nor-
malized the dH/dt with the half of the unsigned ﬂux
(cid:82) |Bz(x, y, z = 0)|dxdy and plotted in Figure 3(d).

The fast emergence phase on September 3rd is accompa-
nied by higher twist injection upto −0.5 × 10−6 turns/s.
Note that the negative sign denotes the negative chirality
of the AR. It refers that the emerging ﬂux is having pre-
existing twist from convection zone. This phase follows
a decrease of twist injection rate to −0.7 × 10−6 turns/s
where horizontal motions dominate over the gradual ﬂux
emergence over days. The time integrated dH/dt/Φ2 is
coronal accumulation of helicity ﬂux H(t)/Φ2 and is plot-
ted in the same panel with y-axis scale on the right. The
H(t)/Φ2 reaches to 0.09 turns by 5th September, indi-
cating a moderately twisted ﬂux system. We point that
the helicity ﬂux calculations in emerging ARs are more
useful for the studies of CME occurrence because the
values represent the AR ﬂux without missing the pre-

existing/emerged structure. Further, Yan et al. (2018)
interpret that the counter-clockwise rotating sunspots
(here N1, P2, N3) inject negative helicity and relate with
the successive X-class ﬂares on September 6, 2017. Our
results suggest that the AR is already in critically non-
potential state by predominant shear motions over entire
evolution period, which in addition of sunspot rotation
could trigger eruptions on the September 6.

The recurrent CME producing AR 12371 is found to
accumulate 0.15 turns, whereas CME-poor ﬂare-rich AR
12192 is having 0.02 turns (Vemareddy 2017) over a sim-
ilar time of evolution. In the former case ﬂux rope (sig-
moid) structure is observed whereas no ﬂux rope in the
later. As suggested by Vemareddy (2017), a higher value
H(t)/Φ2 denotes more twisted ﬂux system like ﬂux rope
and have lesser conﬁning ﬂux. From these cases, we sug-
gest that the magnetic ﬂux normalized helicity ﬂux is an
important parameter in distinguishing strong erupting
ARs.

is computed and plotted in Figure 3(e). Correspond-
ing to the dH/dt proﬁle, the energy ﬂux injection dE/dt
(a positive deﬁnite quantity always) also shows a higher
rate of input during rapid emerging phase which reaches
to 8 × 1027erg/s. Assuming this value of ﬂux for two
days, the coronal energy budget would be 1.35 × 1033ergs
that probably supplied for the M-class ﬂaring activity on
September 5. Following this phase, the dH/dt maintains
its constant inﬂux at an average value of 7 × 1027erg/s.
Given this constant supply of energy ﬂux, the accumu-
lated quantity is 4 × 1033ergs by the end of September 7.
Notedly, dE/dt in this AR is strong by a factor of two
compared to less intense-ﬂaring ARs (Vemareddy 2015,
2017). From this energy ﬂux study, we suggest that the
coronal magnetic ﬁeld is constantly driven to a stressed
state of critical energy level that is signiﬁcant enough to
power the sequential X-ﬂares with CMEs.

3.2. NLFFF model of AR magnetic structure
The AR magnetic structure is reconstructed by per-
forming nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapola-
tion of the observed photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld
(Wiegelmann & Inhester 2010). In order to weaken the
eﬀects of the lateral boundaries, the observed boundary
is inserted in an extended ﬁeld of view and computations
are performed on a uniformly spaced computational grid
of 800 × 800 × 400 representing physical dimensions of
291 × 291 × 146 Mm3. At diﬀerent epochs of AR evolu-
tion, the ﬂux imbalance is less than 10%. To satisfy the
force-free conditions, the magnetic ﬁeld components are
pre-processed (Wiegelmann et al. 2006). We ﬁrst initi-
ated the NLFFF code with potential ﬁeld (PF) but found
that the modelled ﬁeld failed to reproduce the structured
AIA emission especially the hook shapes. This is due
to the fact that the large scale structure is not close to
potential ﬁeld. Therefore, the NLFFF code is initiated
with the 3D linear force-free ﬁeld (LFFF) constructed
from the vertical ﬁeld component of the observed ﬁeld

(Gary 1989). The force-free parameter used is obtained
by minimizing the least-square diﬀerence of the mod-
elled and observed transverse ﬁeld and is known as αbest
(Pevtsov et al. 1994; Hagino & Sakurai 2004). Direct use
of this LFFF with αbest parameter as initial condition for
NLFFF results in over injection of magnetic twist into
the ﬁeld lines leading to their unexplained shape. We
make several runs with varying αbest and compare the ﬁ-
nal NLFFF structure with coronal images and then found
that a value of half of the estimated αbest would result in
for the suitable initial model for NLFFF. The NLFFF re-
laxation is proceeded by minimizing the functional L con-
taining volume integral terms of Lorentz-force, magnetic
ﬁeld divergence and a surface integral term that accounts
the measurement errors while injecting the boundary ob-
servations. The ﬁnal solution is assessed by the current-
weighted sine angle sinθJ between magnetic ﬁeld B and
electric current density J and magnetic ﬁeld divergence
in the computational box (Wheatland et al. 2000). In our
cases of NLFFF extrapolation, the relaxation converges
to 10−3 of initial L with 10-12◦ of θJ and an average mag-
netic ﬁeld divergence of the order of 10−4. Note that the
initial condition of LFFF is implemented to reproduce
the unexplained structure by NLFFF resulted with PF,
and is constrained by the observed conﬁguration of the
coronal images after several trial runs with varying αbest.
The NLFFF magnetic structure at diﬀerent epochs is
shown in Figure 4. The rendered ﬁeld lines are overlaid
on Bz map in the ﬁrst column and on AIA 94 ˚A passband
images in the second column panels. The ﬁeld lines con-
necting P2, N1 form lower lobe and that connecting N3,
P1 form another northern hook structure. The ﬁeld lines
anchored near the SPIL are inverse S-shaped and graze
the PIL manifesting low lying ﬂux rope (blue arrow in
04T18:00 UT panel) and are overlaid by high lying poten-
tial like ﬁeld lines. This ﬂux rope structure persisted in
all panels as indicated by arrow. This modelled structure
mimics the sigmoidal shape very well exhibited in AIA
94 ˚A images. Especially the hooked structure in the top
and bottom of the inverse S-sigmoid matched well. The
global magnetic structure seems not changed much from
September 4 to 6, which means that the photospheric
ﬂux motions maintains the global non-potentiality by
sigmoidal shape. While there are active events releasing
stored energy by the ﬁeld reconﬁguration, it is replen-
ished by underlying photospheric shear and converging
ﬂux motions through quasi-static evolution.

It is important to note the projection eﬀect with obser-
vations. When the AR moves away from the disk center,
the radial direction becomes increasingly departed from
the line of sight, so in order to compare the modeled ﬁeld
lines with the coronal AIA observations, the best practice
is to tilt the modelled magnetic structure by an angle of
the AR position on the disk (Guo et al. 2016, 2017a). Al-
though should have corrected, this projection eﬀect has
little contribution in our overlaid panels of AIA 94˚A .
Especially, the ﬁeld lines in the lower limb of the sigmoid
on September 6, which are higher in height, appear to
deviate a bit from the emission pattern.

In the third column panels, we display the vertically in-
tegrated electric current ((cid:80)
z |J|) distribution. The coro-
nal ﬁeld is driven by photospheric shear motions which
naturally builds coronal volume currents in the stressed

conﬁguration. Corresponding to the sheared/twisted
ﬁeld structure (ﬂux rope), the intense |J| are present
along main PIL. The overall morphology of this cur-
rent distribution is similar to the sigmoid observed in
EUV 304 ˚A images displayed in fourth column panels
and demonstrates the NLFFF model captures the most
of the observed features.

In Figure 5, the rendered core ﬁeld structure is dis-
played in top view (second column panels) and perspec-
tive view (third column panels). For a better representa-
tion of volume current with the ﬁeld lines, we also display

ferent days, the structure mimics the twisted ﬂux rope
above the main PIL. Especially, the NLFFF structure at
18:00 UT on September 4 is compact with coherent con-
tinuous twisted ﬁeld lines. On other days, there exists
highly sheared arcade in addition to low lying continu-

ous inverse-S ones. However, the ﬁeld lines connecting
north-west bipolarities are part of sheared arcade in the
top hook structure of the sigmoid.

A careful examination reveals a null point topology
in the 04T18:00 UT frame as depicted in the Figure 6.
The null point position is located by algorithm described
in (Vemareddy & Wiegelmann 2014). Basically it in-
volves scanning for the null to locate a possible grid cell
and then ﬁnding the precise position using a tri-linear
interpolation with the help of an iterative NewtonRaph-
son scheme within the grid cell. The null point is lo-
cated above a positive polarity on the east side of the
N1 polarity. It is at a height of around 5.8 Mm. Null
point topology is typically associated with a fan-spine
ﬁeld line structure. The null point properties are de-
scribed by eigen values and eigen vectors of the Jacobian
δB = ∇jBi = ∂Bi/∂xj obtained in the vicinity of the
null (Lau & Finn 1990). Two of the eigenvectors (with
the same sign for the eigenvalues) deﬁne the fan surface
and the third one speciﬁes the spine direction. Knowing
fan plane orientation by two of the eigen vectors, ﬁeld
lines away from the null can be traced in a circle of points
on either side of the fan-plane to visualize the local null
topology. Here the spine ﬁeld lines overly the ﬂux rope
and have foot points spreading in P1 and P2 polarities
as conﬁning structure. This is one of the the proposed
structures in a complex quadrapolar magnetic conﬁgu-
ration facilitating breakout reconnection the underlying
ﬂux rope eruption (Antiochos et al. 1999). Note that
here the ﬂux rope is under the spine ﬁeld lines instead of
fan ﬁeld lines as for example in Guo et al. (2016). These
kind of structures form in regions of new emerging ﬂux
into a preexisting ﬂux of inverse conﬁguration (Wu et al.
2005; T¨or¨ok et al. 2009). All together, the modelled ﬁeld
reproduces the complex magnetic structure resembling
the observed EUV sigmoid with embedded twisted ﬂux
rope.

3.3. Quantitative estimates of energy, helicity, twist

number

The total magnetic energy is estimated by (cid:82)

V B2/8πdV
in the AR volume. Owing to the net ﬂux increase in the
AR, the potential energy Ep increases from 12.4 × 1032
ergs on 04T18:00 UT panel to 18.7×1032 ergs at 06T11:24
UT panel. The total energy E have increasing nature
from 18 × 1032 ergs on 04T18:00 UT to 26.6 × 1032 ergs
on 06T08:36 UT. This indicates that the AR reaches to
higher non-potential state by this time and an X2.2 ﬂare
was seen peaking at 06T09:10 UT. The total magnetic
energy is less by 2.8 × 1032 by 06T10:36 UT compared
to the earlier panel indicating energy during the ﬂare.
However, it increased to 25.9 × 1032 ergs by 06T11:24
UT showing energy storage for the X9.3 ﬂare which oc-
curred commencing from 06T11:53 UT. Since the free
energy is above 5.6 × 1032 ergs at any time, an M or X
class ﬂare associated with CME is expected depending on
the other favorable non-potential conditions as discussed
in the section 3.1. We can compare these energy estima-
tions to that derived from energy injection method (equa-
tion 2) by time integration as Eacc = (cid:82) T
0 (dE/dt) dt. As
can be seen in Table 1, the E, Eacc agrees each other by
orders of magnitude except the fact that E corresponds
to the activity events indicating storing/releasing phase

unlike the monotonous accumulation in the later.

From the helicity injection method discussed in sec-
tion 3.1.4, the coronal magnetic helicity is estimated as
Hacc = (cid:82) T
0 (dH/dt) dt. Alternatively, this can also be
computed from volumetric distribution of magnetic ﬁeld
above the AR, which is generally a model like force-free
extrapolation (for more details on diﬀerent methods, re-
fer to Valori et al. 2016). To compare the coronal helicity
budget, we calculate relative magnetic helicity (Berger &
Field 1984) from the 3D modeled ﬁeld as given by

HR =

(cid:90)

V

(A + Ap) · (B − Bp) dV

(3)

Here the reference ﬁeld is potential ﬁeld Bp and Ap is the
corresponding vector potential. The main assumption
involved is that the reference ﬁeld should have the same
normal ﬁeld component as that of the real magnetic ﬁeld
on the boundaries. We construct the vector potentials
with the formalism given in DeVore & Antiochos (2000)
under the Coulomb gauge condition as

Ap(x, y, z) = ∇ × ˆz

(cid:90) ∞

z

dz(cid:48)φ(x, y, z)

(4)

where the scalar function obeys the Laplace equation
∇2φ = 0 recovering the potential ﬁeld such that ∇ ×
Ap = −∇φ. Using the Green’s function for Laplace
equation as integral kernel,

φ(x, y, z) =

Bz(x, y, z = 0)
[(x − x(cid:48))2 + (y − y(cid:48))2 + z2]1/2
(5)
This result is used to calculate the vector potential Ap
at z = 0. These boundary values are used to compute
the A for the actual magnetic ﬁeld B, by integration

A(x, y, z) = Ap(x, y, 0) − ˆz ×

(cid:90) z

dz(cid:48)B(x, y, z(cid:48))

(6)

The values of HR and Hacc are tabled in Table 1. They
match each other in orders of magnitude. A point to
be noted is that the information of helicity taken away
by intermittent CMEs is not included in Hacc and show
monotonous increase in time whereas the HR decreases
after X2.2 ﬂare (10:36 UT) and then increases (11:24
UT) towards X9.3 ﬂares on September 6. Moreover, HR
is consistent with the E for being the fact that they are
related each other proportionally.

Given 3D ﬁeld distribution, one can calculate the twist
number for each ﬁeld line (Berger & Prior 2006; Inoue
et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2016)

Here the twist is related to the parallel electric current

twist number then is given by

last column of Figure 8. The ﬂux rope boundary is as-
sumed as the QSLs of the large Q-values, within which
the ﬁeld lines are twisted. The values of < Tw > are
furnished in Table 1. The Tw values in the ﬂux rope at
04T18:00UT ranges to 2 turns (negative is for left hand
helicity) but the < Tw > becomes 1.2 turns indicating
favorable condition for kink-instability as also reported
by Yang et al. (2017). In the 05T12:00 UT and 06T00:12
UT time shots, the < Tw > is small for the fact that the
ﬁeld lines are in sheared arcade form. Tw has maximum
values of 1.72 in the 06T08:36 UT panel, but the average
value comes down to 0.87 turns. In the later times, the
< Tw > recovers to 0.99 turns before the large X9.3 ﬂare
at 11:53 UT. Further, the < Tw > values correspond to
Hrel values at diﬀerent epochs because the later is the
measure of twist, linking, and shear which mostly come
from the core part. The < Tw > values represent the
physical structure of magnetic ﬁeld derived from the si-
multaneous observations, thus are not in agreement with
the Hacc which in itself has no information of the loss
of helicity by ﬂux rope eruption i.e., ﬂux rope present
or not. Helicity injection builds the coronal structure of
ﬂux rope, expecting the buildup of the ﬂux rope twist
with the coronal helicity accumulation as reported in the
modeling analysis of Guo et al. (2013). However, this is
possible as long as no eruption occurs in the observation
time window.
In any AR since its emergence, helicity
builds to form structures like ﬂux ropes which erupt af-
ter some critical value. A persistent injection of helicity
would builds such structures over a time scale of tens
of hours after every eruption successively and has been
the subject of recent studies (Vemareddy 2017). Alto-
gether, our estimated parameters are evidently shown to
change with the ﬂux rope presence or its eruption. This
modeling analysis quantitatively captures the most of the
theoretical aspects as seen with the coronal activity.

From the Tw computation, we can also estimate the
self-helicity of the ﬂux rope as Hs = ΣN
i , with
the summation running over N ﬂux tubes. We use the
ﬂux rope cross section deﬁned by the closed-QSLs in the
boundary. The values vary between 0.3 − 1.0 × 1040 Mx2
at diﬀerent time snapshots. This is consistent with the
previous ﬁndings of Guo et al. (2013); Guo et al. (2017b)
that the self-helicity becomes negligible for large N.

Quasi separatrix layers (QSLs) are the regions of the
magnetic volume where the ﬁeld line connectivity ex-
periences dramatic but continuous variations (Demoulin
et al. 1996). The locations of QSLs are determined by
computing the squashing factor (Q; Titov et al. 2002).
From the 3D PF and NLFFF, we calculate Q using the
code developed by Liu et al. (2016) according to the for-
malism given in Pariat & D´emoulin (2012). In Figure 7,

the 3D-rendering of LogQ is shown for diﬀerent time
shots of NLFFF structure. There are large Q values upto
15 orders, but a scaling of 0 < LogQ < 4 is applied in
order for a better visualization of all range. As is obvious
from the panels, the Q-distribution outlines the sigmoid
structure with the ﬁeld lines in the core of the ﬂux rope,
the overlying potential arcade, and 2J ﬁeld lines, similar
to the QSL analysis of Tassev & Savcheva (2017) for the
Titov & D´emoulin (1999) ﬂux rope. Higher values of Q
are located in the core part of the sigmoid above the main
PIL. Online only available animation demonstrates the
relationship of the Q-distribution with variable opacity
and the ﬁeld lines. QSLs (in blue) above the main PIL
majorly separates the quasi-connectivity domains from
P1 and N1 polarities. The QSLs of large Q-values are
likely places for reconnection, in which the line-of-sight
integrated emission resembles the given shape for the X-
ray or EUV sigmoid. However, all QSLs of higer Q-values
are not associated with the intense volume currents as de-
scribed in (Savcheva et al. 2012a; Guo et al. 2013; Yang
et al. 2015).

Further, the Q (in logarithmic scale) in a vertical slice
placed across the ﬂux rope (see Figure 4) is plotted in
Figure 8. Bz contours at ±80G are also shown with
thin blue/red curves. The joining locations of these con-
tours at the photosphere (z=0) corresponds to the main
PIL and is surrounded by magnetic domains of sheared
arcade enclosed in a less sheared potential ﬁeld. The im-
portant QSLs are identiﬁed by large values of Q i.e., the
black lanes (or patches) in our negated maps. Owing to
the presence of stressed ﬁeld conﬁguration, there is clear
diﬀerence in the domains of sheared arcade in both the
PF and NLFFF, especially the candle-ﬂame or inverse
tear-drop like shape in the later. The inner core of the
sheared arcade is highly twisted manifesting a ﬂux rope
extended upto 6 Mm (pointed by blue arrow).

To be more clear, the Q maps for ﬂux rope cross sec-
tion (red rectangle) is displayed in third column of the
same ﬁgure. The large values of Q in the 04T18:00 UT
panel are located in the ﬂux rope border which diﬀerenti-
ates the domains of ﬂux rope with twisted ﬁeld lines and
the surrounding sheared arcade, similar to the studies of
Guo et al. (2013); Zhao et al. (2014); Liu et al. (2016).
However, this ﬂux rope structure is not clear with large
QSLs in the border for the 05T12:00 UT, 06T00:12 UT
panels probably because ﬂux rope was not formed, after
the ﬁrst phase of ﬂaring activity from 04T18:00 UT, from
the sheared arcade. This is consistent with the inference
of Yang et al. (2016) who found that the closed-QSL of
ﬂux rope becomes smaller as a consequence of the ﬂare.
In the 06T08:36UT panel, these QSLs appear to be can-
dle ﬂame shape with less width compared to 04T18:00
UT case. And this structure is diﬀused in 06T10:36 UT
panel, probably for the fact that the ﬂux rope might

distribution outlines the sigmoid structure with the ﬁeld lines at the core of the ﬂux rope, the overlying potential arcade, and 2J ﬁeld
lines. Higher values of LogQ are located in the core part of the sigmoid. An online only animation for 04T18:00 UT shot describes the

partially erupted during X2.2 ﬂare at 06T08:57 UT. The
06T11:24 UT panel clearly shows the semi-closed QSL
implying a developed state of the ﬂux rope before X9.3
ﬂare at 11:53 UT. We should point from these QSL analy-
sis that the ﬂux rope has an HFT topology from 06T08:36
UT onwards as the QSL legs cross each other below as
also revealed by the numerical study of this AR by Jiang
et al. (2018). Diﬀerently, the topology would be BPSS in
04T18:00 UT panel as the QSLs touch the photosphere
tangentially.

Further, there are other QSLs associated to large scale
magnetic structure enclosing the ﬂux rope. These are
also self-closed QSLs diﬀerentiating less sheared ﬁeld
lines over the ﬂux rope and the potential ones in even
higher height. Importantly, there exists intersecting self-
closed QSLs in the 04T18:00 UT. The intersection is at
the null point above the positive polarity on the east
side of the ﬂux rope as displayed in Figure 6. Thus the
spine ﬁeld lines extends in the P1, P2 over the ﬂux rope.

The reconnection in the null point helps to reduce the
overlying ﬁeld, as in a breakout reconnection scenario,
enabling the ﬂux rope eruption (Wu et al. 2005; T¨or¨ok
et al. 2009). As the positive polarity moves southward,
these intersecting QSLs become separated after 05T12:00
UT panels.

It is important to note the height of the large scale
QSLs over the time evolution. They appears at in-
creasing height from 04T18:00 UT panel to 06T10:36
UT panel. In the presence of persistent slow shear mo-
tions of the magnetic patches (N1 and P1) at the photo-
sphere (Figure 2), the ﬁeld lines are increasingly stressed.
This results in the decreased distance of the QSL legs
rooted in the photosphere on either side of the PIL.
The conﬁguration still remains in equilibrium by increas-
ing the extent of sheared arcade height from 18 Mm on
04T18:00UT to 34 Mm on 06T10:36 UT. We believed
that this highly energized sheared arcade system is criti-
cally stable and is prone to erupt to a small perturbation

very fast ﬂux emergence cases (Sun & Norton 2017).

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Using continuous time-series SDO observations, we
studied the long term-evolution of ﬂare-proliﬁc AR 12673
right from its emergence on the visible photosphere. The
AR emergence occurred with a couple of dipoles in the
vicinity of pre-existing positive polarity sunspot whose
interaction by shear/proper motions builds into compact
δ-AR complex with curved SPIL. This main SPIL is seen
with persistent strong shear and converging ﬂows of op-
posite polarities on either side. A major helicity injection

In order to have more insight on helicity ﬂux input, we
compared the normalized helicity ﬂux ( 1

in diﬀerent ARs in Figure 9. The value is a measure of
non-potentiality per unit ﬂux per unit time and indicates
how fast the AR accumulates energy and helicity. As is
clear from the plot, this parameter evolves at a higher
rate by a factor of 3 in AR 12673 compared to other ARs.

UT, 2015-06-19T00:00 UT, 2014-10-21T00:00 UT, 2012-03-06T00:00 UT , for AR 12673, 12371, 12192, 11429 respectively. Normalized
helicity ﬂux injection in AR12673 is comparatively high with major injection phase co-temporal with rapid ﬂux emergence. The mean
values in the given time windows of these ARs are noted as −0.52 × 10−6 s−1, −0.19 × 10−6 s−1, −0.08 × 10−6s−1, −0.25 × 10−6s−1
respectively.

12673, 12371, 12192, 11429 respectively. The AR 12192
is a ﬂare-proliﬁc region without CMEs (Sun et al. 2015)
in contrast to the rest of the ARs (Vemareddy 2017)
and has small injection value per ﬂux tube, Interestingly,
this value in our AR is quite stronger by a factor of 2
than the strong CME-proliﬁc ARs 12371, AR11429 which
is suggested to be key parameter for generating severe
space-weather events as the case in AR12673.

While this helicity ﬂux builds up the sigmoid by
September 4, the helicity injection by the continued shear
and converging motions in the later evolution contributes
to sigmoid sustenance and its core ﬁeld twist as a mani-
festation of the ﬂux rope which erupts after exceeding
critical value of twist. Moreover, the total length of
SPIL segments correlates with the non-neutralized cur-
rent (|DC/RC|) and maintains a higher value in both
the polarity regions in the AR. This higher value of
non-neutralized currents is a signature of strong non-
potentiality and eruptive capability of the AR according
to the ﬂux rope models (Zakharov & Shafranov 1986;
T¨or¨ok et al. 2014), and is suggested to be a proxy assess-
ing the ability of ARs to produce major eruptions (Liu
et al. 2017; Vemareddy 2017, 2019).

Corresponding to the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld evo-
lution, we also studied the magnetic conﬁguration by
modeling the coronal ﬁeld. The modelled magnetic ﬁeld
qualitatively reproduces the sigmoidal structure captur-
ing major features like twisted core ﬂux as ﬂux rope,

and hook-shaped parts connecting P1 and N3 polarity
regions. Topological study indicates that the AR consists
of QSLs in the surroundings of the ﬂux rope in the core
and those in the large structure surrounding the sheared
arcade. The ﬂux rope was likely having BPSS topology
during the emergence phase (04T18:00 UT) of the AR
whereas it was HFT in later time on September 6. How-
ever, the twist number of the ﬁeld lines in the ﬂux rope
have more than 1.2 turns (with < Tw >≥ 1 turn) indi-
cating a possible kink-unstable nature of the twisted ﬂux
in the core. In addition, the magnetic structure reveals
a null point topology with spine ﬁeld lines overlying the
ﬂux rope. Therefore, both kink-instability and null-point
reconnection in the overlying ﬁeld would have played role
in triggering the ﬁrst phase of the activity from Septem-
ber 4 (Figure 3). In the second phase of the activity on
September 6, although the AR was critically stable, kink-
instability and/or null point reconnection below the ﬂux
rope might play the role of triggering the eruptions, as
also revealed by numerical studies of Jiang et al. (2018).
Further, the twist number of the ﬂux rope, the QSL
structure surrounding the ﬂux rope and coronal helic-
ity and energy budgets are shown to change with the
presence of ﬂux rope and its eruption. This implies
that the the energy and helicity injections from the bot-
tom boundary help build the essential physical condition
for ﬂare/CME occurrence in the long term evolution.
QSL study shows that the sheared arcade is stressed

the many distinguished non-potential characteristics, the
critically stable state from the mid of September 6 is a
crucial factor to explain the recurrent eruptive nature of
this AR. Once the magnetic system is critically stable,
there are basically three alternatives for triggering solar
eruptions viz., internal tether cutting, external tether-
cutting, and MHD instability or loss of equilibrium such
as kink-instability and/or torus-instability (Lin & Forbes
2000; Antiochos et al. 1999; T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005). The
unique non-potential characteristics found in this study
are in agreement with previous studies and interpreta-
tions. Studies of this AR 12673 by Yang et al. (2017)
showed that the ﬂux rope eruption is triggered by kink-
instability because of the exceeding critical twist. They
had proposed a block-induced complex structure for a
ﬂare-productive AR. Similarly, Yan et al. (2018) sug-
gested the sunspot rotation and shearing motion played
an important role in the buildup of free-energy and the

formation of ﬂux ropes in the corona which produces so-
lar ﬂares and CMEs. We believe that the long term evo-
lution of the AR has characteristic clues for the nature
and strength of the activity, which by studying diﬀerent
AR cases can help constrain the space-weather prediction
models.
