We report on non-sequential double ionization of Ar by a laser pulse consisting of two counter
rotating circularly polarized ﬁelds (390 nm and 780 nm). The double ionization probability depends
strongly on the relative intensity of the two ﬁelds and shows a “knee”-like structure as function of
intensity. We conclude that double ionization is driven by a beam of nearly monoenergetic recolliding
electrons, which can be controlled in intensity and energy by the ﬁeld parameters. The electron
momentum distributions show the recolliding electron as well as a second electron which escapes
from an intermediate excited state of Ar+.

Strong laser ﬁelds eﬃciently lead to the ejection of elec-
trons from atoms and molecules. In the continuum the
electron wave packet is driven by the laser ﬁeld and its
trajectory can be controlled by tailoring the time evolu-
tion of the electric ﬁeld vector of the laser pulse on a sub
cycle basis. A laser pulse composed of two harmonic col-
ors oﬀers already a signiﬁcant amount of control param-
eters, such as polarization, relative intensity and phase
between the two ﬁelds. This allows shaping the light ﬁeld
and thus to steer the electron motion in the continuum
or in a bond [1–9]. Particularly versatile and in addition
well controllable waveforms are generated by counter ro-
tating circular two-color ﬁelds (CRTC) shown in Fig. 1
panels (c), (f), (i). These waveforms have spawned re-
cent activities because, unlike circularly polarized light
consisting of only a single color, CRTC ﬁelds can ini-
tially drive electrons away from the atom they have es-
caped from but later drive them back - often on triangu-
larly shaped trajectories to re-encounter their parent ion.
The recapture of these electrons gives rise to the emis-
sion of circularly polarized higher harmonic light as pre-
dicted in pioneering work by Becker and coworkers [10]
and conﬁrmed by recent experimental studies [11]. The
recollision in such ﬁelds has also been identiﬁed by high
energetic electrons [12] as well as by characteristic struc-
tures in the electron momentum distribution at very low
energies where the electrons are Coulomb focused [13].

In the present work we experimentally show that
CRTC ﬁelds also lead to eﬃcient double ionization me-
diated by the re-colliding electron as predicted by recent
classical ensemble calculations [14]. Studying the prob-
ability of double ionization and in particular the three
dimensional momentum distribution of the emitted elec-
trons gives unprecedented insight into the recollision dy-

namics occurring in these two-color laser ﬁelds. In par-
ticular they support that CRTC ﬁelds can be used to cre-
ate a nearly monoenergetic electron beam for attosecond
time-resolved studies. Additionally, very recent theoret-
ical work [15] building on [16] predicts that these recol-
liding electrons can be generated such that they are spin
polarized [17].

In order to generate two-color ﬁelds, we use a 200 µm
BBO to double the frequency of a 780 nm laser pulse
(KMLabs Dragon, 40 fs FWHM, 8 kHz). The fundamen-
tal and the second harmonic are separated using a di-
electric beamsplitter. Before the two are recombined a
neutral density ﬁlter, followed by a lambda-half and a
lambda-quarter waveplate are installed in each pathway.
In the arm of the fundamental wavelength a nm-delay
stage (PI P-752.2CD) is used to adjust the temporal over-
lap and the relative phase between the two colors. Scan-
ning the relative phase between the fundamental and the
second harmonic actively using the nm-delay stage allows
to correct for slow phase drifts in the oﬄine analysis [3].
Using a spherical mirror (f = 80 mm) inside the vacuum
chamber we reach intensities of up to 1.9 × 1014 W/cm2
for the fundamental and 2.6 × 1014 W/cm2 for the second
harmonic. The laser ﬁeld is focused into an argon target
that is generated using supersonic gas expansion. The
peak intensity in the focus was calibrated separately for
both colors using the photoelectron momentum distribu-
tions from ionization by circularly polarized light. For
780 nm the intensity in the focus was obtained from the
measured drift momentum. For 390 nm we observed clear
peaks in the photoelectron energy distribution spaced by
the photon energy. We used the shift of the energy of
these peaks as function of intensity, which is due to the
change in ponderomotive energy, for calibration of the
intensity in the focus. The uncertainty of the absolute
intensity for 780 nm and 390 nm is estimated to be 10 %
and 20 % respectively. Further it should be noted that
our intensity calibration is an insitu measurement of the

FIG. 1: The measured and simulated relative yield of double to single ionization is shown in column I. In column II measured
electron momentum distributions are shown for the ﬁeld ratios E390/E780 of (b) 0.8:1, (e) 1.5:1 and (h) 3.5:1 and a maximum
combined intensity of 5.0 × 1014 W/cm2. In column III the corresponding combined electric ﬁelds Ey/z (arb. units) as well
as the vector potentials Ay/z (atomic units) are depicted for the same ratios E390/E780 (c) 0.8:1, (f) 1.5:1 and (i) 3.5:1. The
phase in which the combined electric ﬁeld is at one of its maxima is marked with a green dot. The helicities of the two colors
and the temporal development of the combined electric ﬁelds and the vector potentials are indicated with arrows. In IV the
corresponding simulated energy distribution of the returning electrons is shown which has been calculated also for the ratios
E390/E780 (d) 0.8:1, (g) 1.5:1 and (j) 3.5:1 using CTMC. The energy needed for double ionization (27.6 eV) and the relevant
excitation energy (17.14 eV) are marked with a dashed orange and a red line, respectively. The number of recollision events
is normalized to 106 single ionization events in IV. All events exceeding 17.14 eV are integrated which is visualized as the red
shaded area. This integral corresponds to the number of returning electrons having enough energy to excite Ar+ and strongly
depends on the ﬁeld ratio E390/E780.

electric ﬁeld and hence includes focal averaging for sin-
gle ionization. To minimize the eﬀect of focal averaging
the gas jet was collimated to 40 ± 10 µm along the ax-
ial direction in the laser focus (Rayleigh length of about
150 µm) for all measurements except the data presented
in Fig. 2 (in this case double ionization rates would have
been too low for low intensities).

The three-dimensional electron momenta presented in
this paper have been measured in coincidence with argon
ions using cold-target recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy
(COLTRIMS) [18]. The length of the electron and ion
arm was 378 mm and 67.8 mm respectively. The homo-
geneous electric and magnetic ﬁelds of 11.2 V cm−1 and
8.3 G, respectively, guided electrons and ions towards po-
sition sensitive microchannel plate detectors with three
layer delay-line anodes [19]. Only one electron was mea-
sured for single and double ionization events.

Using momentum conservation as criterion the false
electron-ion coincidences for single ionization of argon
resulting from simultaneous ionization of two diﬀerent
atoms in one laser shot are determined to be 25%. This

leads to 14% of the electrons that are detected in coinci-
dence with Ar2+ to stem from simultaneous single ioniza-
tion of a second atom. We have corrected our measured
electron momentum distributions for double ionization
for these false coincidences.

In Fig. 1 (a) we show the ratio of doubly to singly
charged argon ions as function of the relative ﬁeld
strength E390/E780 of the 780 nm and 390 nm ﬁeld. The
corresponding photoelectron distributions (b), (e), (h)
are presented in Fig. 1 along with combined electric
ﬁelds and vector potentials (c), (f), (i) for three selected
ﬁeld ratios. The maximum combined electric ﬁeld am-
plitude corresponds to an intensity of 5.0 × 1014 W/cm2.
To characterize the strength of the diﬀerent combined
ﬁelds we use “equivalent intensities”, which ensures that
the single ionization rate for given “equivalent intensi-
ties” is similar for diﬀerent shapes of the ﬁeld. We ﬁnd
that the double ionization probability depends strongly
on the relative intensity of the two-colors conﬁrming a
recent prediction [14]. The double ionization probability
shows a maximum at the ratio E390/E780 = 1.5. Dou-

a clear evidence that double ionization takes place non-
sequentially and is mediated by a recolliding electron.

To illuminate the recollision physics causing the ob-
served dependence of double ionization probability we
show the measured electron momentum distributions for
single ionization [Fig. 1, column II] together with the
simulated energy distributions of recolliding electrons
[Fig. 1, column IV]. The measured electron momentum
distributions exhibit a strong dependence on E390/E780
in qualitative agreement with recent reports by Mancuso
et al.
[6, 12]. The discussion of single ionization is not
in the focus of the present paper but is shown here to
guide intuition. Panels (d), (g), (j) in Fig. 1 show simu-
lated energy distributions of recolliding electrons at the
distance of closest approach using a classical trajectory
Monte Carlo (CTMC) simulation. For this we have cal-
culated classical electron trajectories with weights ob-
tained by ADK theory [20] starting at the exit of the
tunnel with zero momentum in direction parallel to the
tunnel and a Gaussian distribution of momenta trans-
verse to the tunnel direction as given by ADK theory.
The electron trajectories are calculated in the presence
of the Coulomb ﬁeld. In order to select trajectories which
potentially can lead to ionization or excitation of the par-
ent ion by energy transfer from the recolliding electron,
we have postselected electrons, which have passed the
parent ion at a distance smaller than dmin = 5 a.u. and
have plotted their excess energy at the instant of closest
approach. The number of trajectories has been normal-
ized to the total number of 106 freed electrons and thus
giving the fraction compared to total single ionization.
Also indicated in Fig. 1 (column IV) are the energy of
the ﬁrst relevant excited state of Ar+ at 17.14 eV and the
ionization threshold at 27.6 eV. Strikingly, the distribu-
tions of recollision energies shows a pronounced narrow
peak which is swept in energy and intensity as the ratio
E390/E780 is varied. The measured maximum of the dou-
ble ionization yield [Fig. 1 (a)] coincides with the ﬁeld
ratio for which the ﬂux of recolliding electrons with ener-
gies suﬃcient to excite the Ar+ reaches its maximum. At
the intensities used in the experiment there are no rec-
olliding electrons with energies above the Ar+ ionization
threshold (yellow line in Fig. 1 column IV). This sug-
gests that double ionization occurs solely by recollision
induced excitation followed by subsequent ionization of
Ar+∗ (see e.g. [21–23]).

To model the double ionization yield by impact excita-
tion more quantitatively we have weighted the simulated
electron energy distributions shown in Fig. 1 (d), (g),
(j) with the energy dependent electron impact excitation
cross section from [24] and integrated over the electron
energy. This simple estimate reproduces the observed
E390/E780 dependence of double ionization as shown by
the dashed line in Fig. 1 (a). Although the obtained
maximum turned out to be robust regarding the choice
of dmin it should be noted that the somewhat arbitrary
value of dmin as selection criterion of the recollision tra-

3

jectory allows us to estimate only the dependence of the
double ionization yield on E390/E780 but not an absolute
value as for example given by quantitative rescattering
(QRS) theory [25].

So far our scan of E390/E780 together with the trajec-
tory simulations suggests that double ionization in CRTC
ﬁelds is driven by recollision induced excitation and that
tuning E390/E780 allows to create nearly monoenergetic
beams of recolliding electrons [see Fig. 1 (d), (g)]. To fur-
ther support and detail these ﬁndings we discuss in the
remainder of this paper the intensity dependence of dou-
ble ionization in CRTC ﬁelds and compare the three di-
mensional momentum distribution of the electrons from
single and double ionization.

FIG. 2: Relative yield of double ionization is shown as a func-
tion of intensity in focus for linear polarization at 780 nm and
for a CRTC ﬁeld with E390/E780 = 1.23 which is close to
the maximum in Fig. 1 (a). For the CRTC ﬁeld a similar
“knee”-like shape is observed as it is commonly known for
linear polarization. The two ﬁrst points for linear polariza-
tion on the ordinate indicate that no double ionization events
were measured within a reasonable amount of time.

Fig. 2 shows the intensity dependence of the Ar2+/Ar+
ratio for a CRTC ﬁeld with E390/E780 = 1.23 which
is close to the maximum in Fig 1 (a). We have found
a steep increase of double ionization at an intensity of
around 2.0 × 1014 W/cm2 followed by a broad plateau.
This shape is very similar to the “knee”-like shape for
linear polarized light (red circles) (see e.g.
[26]). The
double ionization probability of the CRTC ﬁelds is sup-
pressed by one order of magnitude compared to linearly
polarized light. The reason for this suppression is that
in contrast to linearly polarized light the electrons in
CRTC ﬁelds are driven in two dimensions and hence they
often require some initial momentum in order to recol-
lide with the core. This is similar to the double ioniza-
tion suppression for elliptically polarized light or orthog-
onal linearly polarized two-color ﬁelds [2]. An inspec-
tion of the energy of simulated recollision electrons con-
ﬁrms, that the sharp drop-oﬀ of double ionization below
2.0 × 1014 W/cm2 is caused by an absence of recolliding
electrons with energies above the ﬁrst relevant excitation

tion beyond 6.0 × 1014 W/cm2 is caused by the onset of
sequential ionization.

FIG. 3: Measured electron momentum distributions for single
(a) and double (b) ionization for a ratio of E390/E780 = 1.42
and a combined intensity of 4.5 × 1014 W/cm2. The corre-
sponding vector potential is shown in black and the phase
that belongs to the maximum combined ﬁeld is indicated by
a green dot. The dashed white line serves as guide to the
eye regarding the rotation of the low energy structure (pur-
ple structure at momenta smaller than 0.3 au).

the normalized diﬀerence A−B

counts in the corresponding bins normalized to the sum of all
counts for double (single) ionization. In (d) the tomographi-
cally reconstructed electron momentum distribution is shown
for the condition that the ﬁrst electron has been detected in
the shaded area in (c). Electrons in this area have recollison-
ally excited the ion at the time of the pulse which is indicated
by the yellow dot in c). d) shows the momenta of the cor-
responding excited electron set free later in the pulse. The
labels 1, 2, 3 the ﬁrst (1) second (2) or third (3) maximum
of the ﬁeld following the recollision and correspond to time
delays of 433, 1300, 2167 attoseconds after recollision.

To further illuminate the double ionization dynamics
in the CRTC ﬁelds we have measured the electron mo-
mentum distribution for double ionization [Fig. 3 (b)]
and compare it to the one for single ionization [Fig. 3
(a)]. First inspection shows signiﬁcantly higher momenta
and a counter-clockwise rotation of the triangular struc-
ture for electrons from double ionization as compared
to those from single ionization. The counter-clockwise
rotation is caused by the increase of the inﬂuence of the
Coulomb potential for the doubly charged as compared to
the singly charged ion. Single ionization electrons freed

4

at the maximum of the ﬁeld with zero energy would in
the absence of the Coulomb potential be streaked to a
certain ﬁnal momentum. This ﬁnal momentum is given
by the negative vector potential at that time shown by
the green dot on the black line. We have taken the rota-
tion angle of the Lissajous curve relative to our measured
electron momentum distribution from TDSE calculations
[12] and our own classical simulations. (Due to Coulomb
eﬀects this absolute rotation angle should not be taken
as a quantitative measure.)

From our arguments given in the discussion of Fig. 1
we expect two classes of electrons for double ionization:
the initial electron, which recollides and creates an exci-
tation and the second electron, which is freed from the
excited state later on in the laser ﬁeld. The recollid-
ing electron can be best seen in the data by calculating
the normalized diﬀerences of the momentum distribution
from double and single ionization [Fig. 3 (c)]. The yellow
reddish area at the three tips of the vector potential in
Fig. 3 (c) results from these recolliding electrons. The
feature spreads by 0.4 - 0.5 a.u. around the vector poten-
tial, indicating an electron momentum after rescattering
which is in agreement with an energy excess of 3 eV left
on the electron after excitation.

From the location of this feature close to the maximum
of the vector potential [marked with a yellow dot in Fig. 3
(c)] we conclude that the main contribution results from
recollisions close to the electric ﬁeld minimum. The sec-
ond electron, which is set free at a subsequent maximum
of the electric ﬁeld [corresponds to a minimum of the vec-
tor potential and is marked with a green dot in Fig. 3
(a), (d)], can be expected to have a momentum distri-
bution similar to that of single ionization, with the main
diﬀerence that it shows a bigger Coulomb eﬀect escaping
from a doubly charged ion. Also this is clearly seen in the
data as the inner threefold structure in Fig. 3 (b) is ro-
tated counter-clockwise compared to the one from single
ionization (a). The rotation is indicated by the dashed
white line serving as guide to the eye (see e.g. [27]).

In the next step, we now investigate the time delay
between the recollisional excitation and emission of the
excited electron. To do so we impose the condition that
the detected electron’s momentum is in the gray shaded
area in Fig. 3 (c); we know that those electrons are
mainly recolliding electrons. This sets the time zero for
our time measurement. For technical reasons such as de-
tector dead-time and poor ion momentum resolution in
the two spatial dimensions we have used a ﬁltered back-
projection algorithm to tomographically reconstruct the
momentum distribution [6, 12, 28] of the second electron
from the sum of the momenta of the ﬁrst electron and the
ion in z-direction as well as the relative phase of the two
colors (determines the rotation of the combined electric
ﬁeld in space). High frequencies are cut oﬀ in frequency
space. The result is shown in Fig. 3 (d). It can be nicely
seen that the second electron is ionized close to the ﬁrst
[marked with (1) in Fig. 3 (d)] maximum of the electric
ﬁeld that corresponds to a minimum of the vector poten-

has hit the ion. At the second ﬁeld maximum (label (2))
the electron ﬂux is already reduced and by the time of
the third maximum after 2167 attoseconds only a small
fraction of excited electrons is left. This is a powerful
example of how to use CRTC ﬁelds to study electron-
emission dynamics on the attosecond timescale without
being limited to near-single-cycle laser pulses (see e.g.
[29]).

In conclusion, we have shown that CRTC ﬁelds support
non-sequential double ionization and at the same time
allow for a detailed control of the energy distribution of
the recolliding electron wave packet which re-encounters
the parent ion from deﬁned directions. These recolliding
electron wave packets moving in CRTC ﬁelds have ex-
citing applications. One is their use for the generation
of higher harmonics with circular polarization, which is
exploited already today [11]. Another possible applica-
tion is the use of these wave packets to induce molecular
dynamics by recollision [30] where the CRTC ﬁeld would
allow to manipulate the energy and the direction from
which the electron wave packet approaches the molecule.
For such applications it is particularly useful that due

5

to the shape of the vector potential the rescattered elec-
trons are driven to an otherwise mainly empty region
of momentum space as demonstrated by our measure-
ment. Yet another exciting future application builds on
the fact that at the time the electron is set free the ﬁeld
vector rotates as in circularly polarized light. This ro-
tation gives rise to spin polarization of the emitted elec-
trons as predicted in pioneering work [16] and recently
shown experimentally [17]. Our study shows that CRTC
ﬁelds are highly eﬃcient to generate such electrons for
electron impact ionization or excitation paving the way
for attosecond time-resolved collision studies with spin
polarized electrons [15].
