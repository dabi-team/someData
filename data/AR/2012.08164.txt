ABSTRACT

Whilst the most dynamic solar active regions (ARs) are known to ﬂare frequently, predicting the
occurrence of individual ﬂares and their magnitude, is very much a developing ﬁeld with strong
potentials for machine learning applications.

The present work is based on a method which is developed to deﬁne numerical measures of
the mixed states of ARs with opposite polarities. The method yields compelling evidence for the
assumed connection between the level of mixed states of a given AR and the level of the solar
eruptive probability of this AR by employing two morphological parameters: (i) the separation
parameter Sl−f and (ii) the sum of the horizontal magnetic gradient GS.

In this work, we study the efﬁciency of Sl−f and GS as ﬂare predictors on a representative
sample of ARs, based on the SOHO/MDI-Debrecen Data (SDD) and the SDO/HMI - Debrecen
Data (HMIDD) sunspot catalogues. In particular, we investigate about 1000 ARs in order to test
and validate the joint prediction capabilities of the two morphological parameters by applying the
logistic regression machine learning method. Here, we conﬁrm that the two parameters with their
threshold values are, when applied together, good complementary predictors. Furthermore, the
prediction probability of these predictor parameters is given at least 70% a day before.

1 INTRODUCTION
A solar ﬂare is a sudden ﬂash observed in the solar atmosphere which is able to rapidly heat the plasma to
megakelvin temperatures, while the electrons, protons and other heavier ions are accelerated to very large
speeds (Benz, 2008). The associated accelerated particle clouds may reach the Earth, typically within a few
hours or a day following a solar ﬂare eruption. The ﬂares produce radiation across the electromagnetic

spectrum at all wavelengths. Most of the released energy is spread over frequencies outside the visible
range. For this reason, the majority of ﬂares must be observed with instruments which measurements in
these wavelength ranges, as e.g. the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). Therefore,
the most generally known ﬂare classiﬁcation scheme is GOES ﬂare-class. Measurements of the maximum
x-ray ﬂux at wavelengths from 0.1 to 0.8 nm near Earth are classed as A, B, C, M, or X type ﬂares back
from 19751. These ﬁve GOES ﬂare intensity categories are further divided into a logarithmic scale labelled
from 1 to 9. The A-, B- and C-classes are the lowest energy release classes of solar ﬂares and they also
occur frequently in the solar atmosphere. The A to C-class range has no or hardly any detectable effect on
Earth based on current instrumentations and understanding. The M-class medium ﬂare category may cause
smaller or occasionally more serious disruptions, e.g. radio blackouts. However, the X-intensity ﬂares may
cause strong to extreme hazardous events, facility break-downs (e.g. radio blackouts, etc.) on the daylight
side of the Earth (Hayes et al., 2017). The major solar ﬂares (M- and X-class) are often accompany with
accelerated solar energetic particles and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (see, e.g., Tziotziou et al., 2010).

For solar activity modelling, a key ingredient is to determine the role of the associated observable
magnetic ﬁeld. Waldmeier (1938) proposed the ﬁrst classiﬁcation scheme to examine the connection
between the size and morphology of active regions (ARs) and the capacity of their ﬂare-productivity.
This classiﬁcation scheme is known today as the Z¨urich classiﬁcation (see also Kiepenheuer, 1953). This
scheme contains eight types thought to be representative of consecutive states in the evolution of a sunspot
group. The classiﬁcation system was further developed by McIntosh (1990). McIntosh introduced three
more components based on characteristics including the Z¨urich class, the largest sunspot, and the sunspot
distribution in an AR. Although the classiﬁcation uses white-light observations only, it is still widely used.

The ﬁrst magnetic classiﬁcation scheme, known as the Mount Wilson classiﬁcation, was introduced
by Hale et al. (1919). It is simpler than the Z¨urich-McIntosh system, as it only distinguishes unipolar,
bipolar, mixed conﬁgurations and very close and mixed conﬁgurations within a common penumbral feature,
denoted by the letters α, β, γ and δ-class, respectively. K¨unzel (1960) added the δ-class conﬁgurations for
the McIntosh system which refer to the most productive sources of energetic ﬂares (see, e.g., Schrijver,
2016, and references therein). All these classiﬁcation schemes are useful in revealing potential connections
between the morphological properties of sunspot groups and their ﬂare-productivity. However, it is
somewhat ambiguous that these classiﬁcation schemes rely on a number of rather subjective elements to be
identiﬁed by visual inspection besides some more objective measures.

The McIntosh and Mount Wilson classiﬁcations have been shown to be useful for grouping ARs by their
expected ﬂare productivity (Gallagher et al., 2002; Ireland et al., 2008; Bloomﬁeld et al., 2012). However,
further quantities derived from AR observations allow a physical comparison and deeper understanding
of the actual causes of the solar eruptions. In this sense, different morphological parameters have been
introduced to characterised the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration or highlight the existence of polarity-inversion-
lines (PILs) in ARs, with varying sophistication (see e.g. Barnes et al., 2016; Leka et al., 2018, 2019a,b;
Campi et al., 2019; Park et al., 2020, and references therein). Furthermore, Kontogiannis et al. (2018)
investigated and tested some of those parameters, which were identiﬁed as efﬁcient ﬂare predictors. These
parameters include, e.g., a quantity denoted as Bef f that measures the coronal magnetic connectivity
between the opposite magnetic ﬁeld elements (Georgoulis and Rust, 2007), Ising energy EIsing of a
distribution of interacting magnetic elements (Ahmed et al., 2010), the sum of the horizontal magnetic
ﬁeld gradient GS (Kors´os and Erd´elyi, 2016), and the total unsigned non-neutralized currents, IN N,tot
(Kontogiannis et al., 2017).

The observed magnetic properties of an AR can be processed for the purpose of prediction by machine
learning (ML) computational methods for data analysis (Camporeale, 2019), such as neural networks
(Ahmed et al., 2013), support vector machines (Bobra and Couvidat, 2015; Boucheron et al., 2015),
relevance vector machines (Al-Ghraibah et al., 2015), ordinal logistic regression (Song et al., 2009),
decision trees (Yu et al., 2009), random forests (Liu et al., 2017; Domijan et al., 2019), and deep learning
(Nishizuka et al., 2018). Notably, parameters Bef f , EIsing, GS, and IN N,tot were used by the FLARECAST
project2, where the prediction capabilities of almost 200 parameters were tested by the LASSO and Random
Forest ML techniques (Campi et al., 2019). From these 200 parameters, the FLARECAST project found
that the four morphological parameters were ranked as good ﬂare predictors.

The content of the paper is as follows: Section 2 overviews in detail the two morphological parameters
used for ﬂare prediction in this work. Section 3 describes the data preparation process and key aspects
of the adopted ML method. Section 4 shows the results of the analysis focusing on two morphological
parameters in particular, while our conclusions are in Section 5.

2 TWO MORPHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS
Kors´os and Erd´elyi (2016) introduced and tested, as a trial, an advantageous scheme that may be used as
new prediction indicators besides the Z¨urich, McIntosh and Mount Wilson classiﬁcation systems. This
scheme includes two morphological parameters, namely:

• The separation parameter Sl−f , which characterises the separation of opposite polarity subgroups in

an AR, given by the formula:

Sl−f =

Dlc−f c
2(cid:112)(cid:80) Ag/π

,

(1)

where l and f refer to the leading and following polarities. The numerator denotes the distance between
the area-weighted centres (therefore the index c) of the spots of leading and following polarities. Fig. 1a
gives a visual representation. The denominator is the diameter of a hypothetic circle (2 times the radius
((cid:112)(cid:80) Ag/π)). The (cid:80)Ag is the sum of individual umbrae areas in a sunspot group.

• The second introduced morphological parameter is the sum of the horizontal magnetic gradient GS,

|Φp,i − Φn,j|

,

(2)

where Φ is the magnetic ﬂux of the umbra based on Kors´os et al. (2014). The indices p and n denote
positive and negative polarities, and i and j are their running indices in the entire sunspot group. D is
the distance between two opposite-polarity umbrae with indices i and j, respectively. Panel c of Fig.1
gives a visual presentation of the GS parameter.

The Sl−f and GS can be determined from the moment of ﬁrst available observation of sunspot groups,
because the applied umbrae data are suitably corrected for geometrical foreshortening in the SOHO/MDI-
Debrecen Data (SDD3) and the SDO/HMI - Debrecen Data (HMIDD4) catalogues (Baranyi et al., 2016).
Furthermore, these two morphological parameters were shown to be potential indicators for upcoming
ﬂares on a smaller number of typical test cases (Kors´os and Erd´elyi, 2016). The test cases included 116
ARs, which were selected from SDD. Their selection was based on that about a third of the ARs produced
only B- and C-class ﬂares, another third produced M-class ﬂares, and the remaining third produced X-class
ﬂares. For the statistical analysis, the considered values of Sl−f and GS were determined 24, 48, and 72 hrs
before ﬂare onset to test the conditional ﬂare probability (CFP) of these two parameters. The CFPs were
calculated as empirical probabilities, which measure the studied ﬂare intensities and adequate recordings
of the happening of events.

Kors´os and Erd´elyi (2016) found that if Sl−f ≤1 for a ﬂaring AR then the CFP of the expected largest
intensity ﬂare being X-class is over at least 70%. If 1≤Sl−f ≤3 the CFP is more than 45% for the largest-
intensity ﬂare(s) to be the M-class, and, if 3≤Sl−f ≤13 there is larger than 60% CFP that C-class ﬂare(s)
may occurs within a 48-hr interval. Next, Kors´os and Erd´elyi (2016) found also that from analysing GS
independently for determining the associated CFPs: if 7.5≤log(GS) then there is at least 70% chance for
the strongest energy release to be X-class; if 6.5≤log(GS)≤7.5 then there is ∼45% CFP that M-class
could be the highest-intensity ﬂares; ﬁnally, if 5.5≤log(GS)≤6.5, then it is very likely that C-class ﬂare(s)
may be the main intensity ﬂares in the coming 48 hours. ARs are unlikely to produce X-class ﬂare(s) if
13≤Sl−f and log(GS)≤5.5.

3 DATA AND DATA PREPARATION
In this study, we further explore test and validate, the joint prediction capabilities of the Sl−f and GS
morphological parameters. The analysis is based on the binary logistic regression algorithm, using the
Scikit-Learn module in Python (Pedregosa et al., 2011). The adopted ML technique requires appropriate
historical datasets for training. Logistic regression is one of simplest and widely-used ML algorithms for
two-class classiﬁcation. Logistic regression is a special case of linear regression where the target variable
is dichotomous in nature. Dichotomous means that there are only two possible classes, e.g. yes/no or
true/false. Logistic regression also predicts the probability of occurrence of a binary event utilising a logit
function.

Four training sets were constructed to enforce consistency in time and test robustness, each one
corresponding to 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-hr forecast issuing time interval, because within a day the forecast
reliability becomes more pronounced. The study takes as a reference the time of the largest ﬂare event for

each AR. For each issuing time interval, we consider the calculated Sl−f or GS values of an AR before this
reference time, as input data for the logistic regression. This framework allows us to quantify the prediction
capabilities of the two morphological parameters.

Similarly to Kors´os and Erd´elyi (2016), this study uses information on around 1000 ARs extracted
from the Debrecen Sunspot Data Catalogue between 1996 and 2015 (Baranyi et al., 2016). The catalogue
contains information including centroid position in various coordinate systems, area, and magnetic ﬁeld
of sunspots and sunspot groups. Derived from spacecraft observations, the catalogue has entries at each
1 hr for SDD5, and 1.5 hr for HMIDD 6. The GOES7 ﬂare catalogue is used for information on the
largest-intensity ﬂare eruption of each AR.

For each issuing time interval, two thirds of the ARs were randomly extracted to create a training set.
These ARs are labelled as true(1) and false(0) events, under two different binary classiﬁcation deﬁnition
models:

• 1st model: When the largest intensity ﬂare of an AR is M- or X-class then this case is classiﬁed as

true(1), otherwise B- or C-class ﬂares are false(0).

• 2nd model: Based on the results of Kors´os and Erd´elyi (2016), an event is true(1) if an AR is host to a
M/X-class ﬂare, satisfying 3≤Sl−f , and 6.5≤log(GS). Or, an event is true(1) if an AR was host to a
B/C-class ﬂare, satisfying Sl−f >3, and log(GS)<6.5. Otherwise the cases are all labelled false(0).

The two different classiﬁcation models were chosen to study whether the two morphological parameters
perform better, either with or without (2nd or 1st model) thresholds. Often, a well-chosen threshold

adjustment(s) could improve prediction capabilities of a method, as a warning level or as a warning sign.
Furthermore, in the case of both model approaches as described above, the set of Sl−f and GS values
associated with the remaining 1/3 ARs are not labelled and are provided as a test set only for the logistic
regression algorithm training. In this manner, there is no overlap between training and testing. To ensure
robustness of the results, we replicated 100 times the training and test datasets for 6/12/18 and 24-hr issuing
time intervals, like e.g. Campi et al. (2019).

4 ANALYSIS
Solar ﬂare prediction is affected by strong class imbalances, in that there are far more negative examples
(labelled as N) than positive ones (labelled as P.) Therefore, we apply different metrics to measure the
performance of the 1st and 2nd models. The performances of the two binary classiﬁers can be characterised
by confusion matrixes in Figs. 2-3. Those confusion matrixes summarise the True Positive (TP), True
Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN) predictions, we adopt different metrics to
quantify the impact performance of the Sl−f and GS parameters in the case of both model approaches (1st
and 2nd). The applied metrics are summarised in Table1 for 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-hr forecast issuing times,
and are:

• Accuracy is the ratio of true positives plus true negatives over all events, or how often the TRUE

prediction is correct: (TP+TN)/(P+N)

• Recall, also called the true positive rate or sensitivity, measures the proportion of actual positives that

are correctly identiﬁed: TP/P

• Speciﬁcity, also called the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are

correctly identiﬁed: TN/N

• Precision, also called positive predictive value. This is the ratio of true positives over all positive

predictions: TP/(TP+FP).

This is a provisional ﬁle, not the ﬁnal typeset article

6

M. B. Kors ´os et al.

Flare prediction by the Sl−f and GS proxies

• Negative predictive value (NPV) is the ratio of true negatives over all negative predictions:

TN/(TN+FN).

• F1 score is the harmonic mean between sensitivity (or recall) and precision (or ). It tells us how precise
our two classiﬁers are, as well as how robust these are. A greater F1 score means that the performance
of our model is better. Mathematically, F1 can be expressed as: 2·(1/Recall+1/Precision)

• True Skill Statistic (TSS) is widely used to test the performance of forecasts (McBride and Ebert,
2000). TSS will be the preferred performance metric when comparing results of the 1st and 2nd model
approaches with different N/P ratios because this metric is independent from the imbalance ratio
(Woodcock, 1976; Bloomﬁeld et al., 2012). TSS takes into account both omission and commission
errors. The TSS parameter is similar to Cohen’s kappa approach (Shao and Halpin, 1995), and compares
the predictions against the result of random guesses. TSS ranges from -1 to +1, where +1 indicates
perfect agreement. The zero or less value indicates that a performance no better than random (Landis
and Koch, 1977).: TSS=TP/P-FP/N=Recall+Speciﬁcity-1

These seven metric parameters are plotted as a function of forecast issuing times in Fig. 4, where the
blue/red lines stand for the 1st/2nd model. Based on the values of Table1 and Fig. 4, the two models
have high accuracy for all forecast issuing times. In both models, the best accuracy is gained by the 24-hr
prediction window. We emphasise that the accuracy is a meaningful measure only if the values of FP and
FN would be similar in the confusion matrices of Figs. 2-3. For dissimilar values, the other metrics must be
considered in evaluating the prediction performance of the two models.

Next, we focus on the recall and speciﬁcity metrics, which show the probability whether a model captures
the correct classiﬁcation during all four intervals. The values of the speciﬁcity metric show that the two
models are capable to correctly classify TN cases during all four intervals, especially in the case of the 1st
model, which is greater than 90%. Based on recall values, the TP classiﬁcation of the 2nd model is 20%
more accurate than the 1st model for 6/12/18/24-hr forecast issuing times.

However, when the two models classify a new AR, then we do not know the true outcome until after an
event. Therefore, we are likely to be more interested in the question what is the probability of a true decision
of the two models. This is measured by precision and NPV metrics. For the 1st model, the precision of
the 24-hr prediction time is ∼10% better than the other issuing time intervals, while the NPV values are
∼80% in the case of four issuing time. The precision and NPV values of the 2nd model are almost the
same over all four prediction windows. Based on precision and NPV metrics, the 2nd model predict a TP
event with higher probability than the 1st model, while the 1st model is better with the case of TN event.
This is because the 2nd model discards some X- and M-class ﬂares which do not satisfy the threshold
conditions. Despite this, the 2nd model still could fairly predict a TN event with about 70% probability.

The F1 and TSS metrics show that the 2nd model performs better than the 1st in the case of all of the
prediction windows. This is an important aspect because the F1 and TSS are the most reliable scores in the
presence of class imbalance. Intuitively, the F1 score is not as easy to understand as that of the accuracy, but
it is usually more useful than accuracy, especially in our case, where we have an uneven class distribution.
Namely, 77% of the F1 score shows that the 24-hr ﬂare prediction window is the most efﬁcient in the case
of the 2nd model approach. Furthermore, the above 0.4 values of TSS score of the 2nd model show that this
method is a good prediction scheme, and, the deﬁned accuracy values of the 2nd model can be considered
as correct.

We also use Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves (ROCs) to evaluated the results of the binary
logistic regression method for both models. In the ROC plots in Figures 2-3, the sensitivity (the proportion

1st model shows similar AUC values during the four prediction windows. In the case of the 2nd model,
the predicting probabilities are also similar based on the AUC values of Fig. 3. On further note that the
predicting probabilities of the 2nd model are 10% less than the 1st one, based on AUC values during the
four prediction windows.

5 CONCLUSION
Kors´os and Erd´elyi (2016) introduced the separation parameter Sl−f and the sum of the horizontal magnetic
gradient GS as potential indirect indicators of the measure of non-potentiality of the magnetic ﬁelds of
solar active regions. They also proposed these two morphological parameters as potential new prediction
proxy indicators complementing the traditional Z¨urich, McIntosh or Mount Wilson classiﬁcation schemes.

Flare prediction by the Sl−f and GS proxies

In this work, a binary logistic regression machine learning approach is used to test and validate the ﬂare
prediction capability of the GS and Sl−f morphological parameters. Two binary classiﬁcation schemes
are used. One scheme is based on a simple approach while implementing solely ﬂare intensity, the
second approach is a more sophisticated model based on both ﬂare intensity and threshold values of the
morphological parameters. This experimental approach is applied to a large set of ∼1000 ARs, with 100
repeats the datasets, over different forecast issuing time intervals of 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-hr. Analysis of
various performance metrics shows the following:

• The morphological parameters give more than 70% ﬂare prediction accuracy, based on logistical
regression analysis. This result supports the ﬁndings of Kontogiannis et al. (2018) and (Campi et al.,
2019), who conclude that the GS parameter has potential as an efﬁcient predictor.

• Based on the F1 scores and the True Skill Statistic metrics, the joint ﬂare prediction efﬁciency of
the Sl−f and GS parameters is improved when the previously identiﬁed threshold values by Kors´os
and Erd´elyi (2016) were also imposed. However, the 2nd model discards some X- and M-class ﬂares
which do not satisfy the threshold conditions. Despite of it, the 2nd model still could predict/classify
an upcoming event with at least 70% probability, based on the precision and NPV metrics.

• The best ﬂare prediction capability of the two parameters is available with 24-hr forecast issuing time.
This latter means that the Sl−f and GS parameters with their thresholds are capable to predict an
upcoming ﬂare with 75% accuracy a day before ﬂare occurrence.

• However, not just the 24 hrs prediction window has good metric scores, but also the ones with 6/12
and 18 hrs. This means that the Sl−f and GS are together applicable for prediction purpose in a short-
and long-term one.

• The limitation of this study is that the applied data are extracted from a given sunspot database.
Therefore, an other ML method (e.g. Convolutional Neural Network) that is trained on the same
SDO/HMI intensity and magnetogram data, may assess further parameters to increase the predictive
capability of the two morphological parameters.

We are aware that the two tested models are not perfect and so a natural question to ask is: how can we
improve further them? In the future, we intend to further explore the application of these two warning
parameters both from machine learning and physics perspectives: (a) ﬁne tune the threshold conditions of
2nd model, (b) extend the application of the Sl−f and GS parameters at different solar atmosphere heights,
(c) train the employed machine learning model at different atmospheric heights for an even more accurate
estimation of ﬂare event time and ﬂare event intensity, and (d) identify an optimal height range giving the
earliest possible ﬂare prediction, similar to the concept described by Korsos et al. (2020).
