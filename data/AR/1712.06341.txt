ABSTRACT
We report the analysis result of UV/X-ray emission from AR Scorpii, which is an intermediate
polar (IP) composed of a magnetic white dwarf and a M-type star, with the XMM-Newton data. The
X-ray/UV emission clearly shows a large variation over the orbit, and their intensity maximum (or
minimum) is located at the superior conjunction (or inferior conjunction) of the M-type star orbit.
The hardness ratio of the X-ray emission shows a small variation over the orbital phase, and shows
no indication of the absorption by an accretion column. These properties are naturally explained by
the emission from the M-type star surface rather than from the accretion column on the WD’s star
similar to the usual IPs. Beside, the observed X-ray emission also modulates with WD’s spin with a
pulse fraction of ∼ 14%. The peak position is aligned in the optical/UV/X-ray band. This supports
the hypothesis that the electrons in AR Scorpii are accelerated to a relativistic speed, and emit non-
thermal photons via the synchrotron radiation. In the X-ray bands, the evidence of the power-law
spectrum is found in the pulsed component, although the observed emission is dominated by the
optically thin thermal plasma emissions with several diﬀerent temperatures.
It is considered that
the magnetic dissipation/reconnection process on the M-type star surface heats up the plasma to a
temperature of several keV, and also accelerates the electrons to the relativistic speed. The relativistic
electrons are trapped in the WD’s closed magnetic ﬁeld lines by the magnetic mirror eﬀect. In this
model, the observed pulsed component is explained by the emissions from the ﬁrst magnetic mirror
point.

1. INTRODUCTION
AR Scorpii (hereafter ARSco) is a white dwarf binary
system categorized as the intermediate polar (hereafter
IP), and it is a compact binary system with a binary sep-
aration of a ∼ 8 × 1010cm. The distance to the source
is d ∼ 110pc (Marsh et al. 2016; Buckley et al. 2017).
This binary system consists of a magnetic white dwarf,
for which the surface magnetic ﬁeld is Bs ∼ 108G, and a
M-type main sequence star (hereafter M-type star) with
a radius of R∗ ∼ 0.4R⊙ and a mass of M∗ ∼ 0.3M⊙. The
spin period of the white dwarf is Ps ∼ 117s, and the or-
bital period of the system is Po = 3.56hrs. In terms of the
radio/optical/UV emission properties, AR Sco is distin-
guished from other IPs, and is similar to those of neutron
star (NS) pulsar. The radio/optical/UV emission modu-
lates due to the spin of the WD, and the light curve shows
the double peak structure. The phase separation between
two peaks is ∼ 0.5 in the optical/UV bands, and the
pulse fraction exceeds 95% at the UV bands (Marsh et al.
2016). The optical emission is observed with a strong lin-
ear polarization and a polarization degree varying over
the spin phase. The double peak structure of the pulse

proﬁle and the morphology of the linear polarization
(Buckley et al. 2017) in the optical bands are resemble
to those of the Crab pulsar, which is an isolate young NS
pulsar with electromagnetic wave from radio to high en-
ergy TeV bands (e.g. Kuiper et al. 2001; Kanbach et al.
2005; Takata et al. 2007). Moreover, the optical emis-
sion from AR Sco also modulates on the orbital period
(3.56hrs), which indicates the heating of the day-side of
the M-type star by the magnetic ﬁeld/radiation of the
WD (Marsh et al. 2016; Katz 2017). This feature is also
similar to that of the millisecond pulsar/low mass star
binary systems (e.g. Fruchter et al. 1988; Kong et al.
2012). With the unique properties of the emission,
AR Sco may be the ﬁrst WD binary system that con-
tinuously shows a non-thermal radiation from relativistic
electrons.

AR Sco’s broadband electromagnetic spectrum from
radio to UV bands is characterized by a synchrotron
radiation from relativistic electrons, indicating acceler-
ation process in the binary system. As pointed out by
Geng et al. (2016), on the other hand, the number of par-
ticles that emits the observed pulsed optical emission of
AR Sco is signiﬁcantly larger than the number that can
be supplied by the WD itself. Geng et al. (2016) thus
suggest that an electron/positron beam from the WD’s
polar cap sweeps the stellar wind from the M-type star,
and a bow shock propagating into stellar wind accelerates
the electrons in the wind. Takata et al. (2018) consider
the relativistic electrons that are trapped at the closed
magnetic ﬁeld lines of the WD by the magnetic mirror ef-
fect, and suggest that the pulse emission is originated by
the emission from the ﬁrst magnetic mirror point. Both
models predict the non-thermal X-ray emission from this
system. However, Marsh et al. (2016) report no signiﬁ-
cance detection of the pulse emission in the X-ray bands,

and determine the upper limit of the pulse fraction at
∼ 30%. Therefore, the origin of the X-ray emission from
this system has not been undetermined. In this paper,
we report the analysis of results from the UV/X-ray data
taken by the XMM-Newton.

2. DATA ANALYSIS
We analyze the archive XMM-Newton data taken at
2016 September 19 (Obs. ID: 0783940101, PI: Steeghs).
This new observation was performed with a total expo-
sures of ∼ 39ks. The observation was operated under
the fast mode for the OM camera, the small window
mode for the MOS1/2 CCDs (time resolution 0.3s), and
the large window mode for the PN camera (time resolu-
tion 47.7ms). Event lists from the data are produced
in the standard way using the most updated instru-
mental calibration, omf chain, emproc and epproc tasks
of the XMM-Newton Science Analysis Software (XMM-
SAS, version 16.0.0). A point source is signiﬁcantly de-
tected (> 100σ) by the XMMSAS task edetect chain
at the position of AR Sco. To perform the spectral
and timing analyses, we extract the EPIC data from
a circle region with a radius of 20′′ centered at source
position (R.A., Decl.) = (16h21m47s.29, −22◦53′10′′.4)
(J2000). The arrival times of all the selected events
of the OM/EPIC data are barycentric-corrected with
the aforementioned position and the latest DE405 Earth
ephemeris.

2.1. Timing analysis
2.1.1. Orbital modulation
Marsh et al. (2016) argue that the un-pulsed opti-
cal/UV emission shows the maximum (or minimum)
brightness at the superior conjunction (or inferior con-
junction) of the M-type star orbit, and the emission is
originated from the day-side of the M-type star. The new
XMM-Newton observation covers more than two orbits
of AR Sco, and the X-ray emission signiﬁcantly modu-
lates over the orbital phase (Figure 1). We can see in the
ﬁgure that the X-ray modulation after subtracting the
background remains a large DC level, and it synchro-
nizes with the UV orbital modulation.

We fold the EPIC data in the orbital

frequency
νo = 0.07792mHz (Table 1) with the reference time To
(MJD)=579264.09615, where the M-type star is in the
inferior conjunction; that is, the M-type star is located
between the WD and Earth. The property of the X-ray
orbital modulation of AR Sco is distinguished from those
of other IPs. AE Aquarii is the IP system whose orbital
period (Po ∼ 9.88hours) and spin period (Ps ∼ 33s) are

similar to those of AR Sco (Choi et al. 2017; Itoh et al.
2006; Terada et al. 2008), but its X-ray emission does
not show signiﬁcant orbital modulation. The observed
X-ray ﬂux from some IPs shows a sharp drop to zero
due to an eclipse of the emission region, which indi-
cates that the X-ray emission region is conﬁned close
to the WD’s surface (Cropper et al. 2002). Some IPs
exhibit an orbital modulation due to an absorption by
an accretion stream, for which the NH and hardness ra-
tio in X-ray bands rapidly vary with the change of the
observed ﬂux (Evans et al. 2004; Pek¨on & Balman 2011;
Rea et al. 2017). For AR Sco, however, a large DC com-
ponent of the observed light curve suggests that the size
of the X-ray emission region is comparable to the size of

the binary system. Moreover, the small variation of the
hardness of the X-ray emission over the orbit (Figure 2)
indicates that the absorption by the accretion matter is
not the origin of the observed orbital modulation.
In-
stead, the large variation of the orbital modulation with
a DC component and synchronizing with the UV mod-
ulation is naturally explained if the emission is origi-
nated from the day-side of the M-type star, on which
the plasma is heated by the magnetic ﬁeld/radiation of
the WD.

In Figure 1, we ﬁnd that OM orbital light curve shows
a faster rise and a slower decay, and the orbit maximum
is prior to the superior conjunction of the companion or-
bit. This orbital waveform is consistent with the previous
results (Marsh et al. 2016; Littleﬁeld et al. 2017). This
orbital shift is interpreted as a consequence of either (1)

Fig. 5.— Energy dependent pulse proﬁles folded in beat fre-
quency: UV (top panel), 0.15-2keV energy bands (middle panel)
and 2-12keV energy bands (right panel). For the OM data, we
remove the data at Tb < 3hours in Figure 1, since there is a large
observational gap. The spectrum of the pulsed component is gener-
ated by subtracting the spectrum at ’Phase 1’ from that at ’Phase
2’

the major magnetic dissipation at the leading surface of
the M-type star or (2) the precession of the rotation axis
of the WD owing to a misalignment to the orbital axis
(Katz 2017). Littleﬁeld et al. (2017) reveals that the or-
bital waveform and maxim gradually shift with time.

2.1.2. Energy dependent pulse proﬁle
In Marsh et al. (2016), the timing analysis shows that
the optical/UV emission from AR Sco is modulating with
the beat frequency of the WD’s spin frequency and the
orbital frequency. The pulse proﬁle folded in the beat
frequency shows a double peak structure with a phase-
separation of ∼ 0.5. Moreover, the peaks in the optical
and UV bands are in phase, and the radiation power of
the pulse emission in the optical/UV bands is comparable
to or more than the DC emission from the M-type star
surface and WD surface. The broadband spectrum from
the radio to optical bands is described by a non-thermal
spectrum. These optical/UV properties suggest that the
AR Sco continuously generates relativistic electrons. To
conﬁrm this hypothesis, the detection of the pulse emis-
sion in a higher energy band and the correlation of the
pulse peaks in diﬀerent energy bands are important. We
therefore search the beat frequency (νB ∼ 8.6mHz) re-
ported by Marsh et al. (2016) in the OM/EPIC data,
and we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant peak at the beat frequency in
the Lomb-Scarge periodogram (Lomb 1976) in OM data
(Figure 3), and in the Z 2
2 periodogram (Buccheri et al.
1983) in all EPIC data (Figure 4). For the EPIC data,
the beat frequency [νb = 8.461100(8)mHz, where the er-
ror is determined by the equation (6a) in Leahy (1987)]
is detected with Z 2
2 ∼ 240 or H ∼ 242 of the H-test
(de Jager & B¨usching 2010), which corresponds to ran-
dom probability of < 10−14, suggesting the X-ray pul-
sation is signiﬁcantly detected. In addition to the fun-
damental beat frequency, a peak in periodogram can be
found at the spin frequency [νs ∼ 8.5390mHz], and their
harmonics. Table 1 summarizes the ephemeris used to

make a folded light curve in this paper.

To investigate property of the pulse proﬁle, we fold
the OM/EPIC data into the beat phase, and obtain the
orbitally phase averaged pulse proﬁles in the UV bands,
0.15-2.0keV bands, and 2-12keV bands (Figure 5). In the
UV bands, the pulse proﬁle is composed of the promi-
nent ﬁrst peak and a small second peak, and the phase-
separation between the peaks is ∼ 0.5 in the beat phase,
which is consistent with the previous result of the opti-
cal/UV pulse proﬁles (Marsh et al. 2016). We can see in
Figure 5, the pulse proﬁle in 0.15-2keV bands is similar to
that of UV bands, although the second peak is less signif-
icance (< 3σ). This similarity in the pulse proﬁle shows
that the pulse emission in the UV/soft X-ray bands is
produced by the same population of the particles.

The narrow phase width of the main peak and the dou-
ble peak pulse proﬁle of AR Sco are also distinguished
from the pulse proﬁles of canonical IPs, in which the X-
ray spin modulation is observed as a broad single pulse
(e.g. Pek¨on & Balman 2011). This observational fact
also supports the hypothesis that the X-ray emission of
AR Sco is not explained by the emission from the ac-
cretion column/heated WD’s surface. Our result shows
that the pulse emission from AR Sco extends from ra-
dio to soft X-ray bands, and the pulse proﬁle is aligned
from the optical/UV to X-ray energy bands (three to
four order of magnitude in the energy). This is a strong
indication that the electrons are accelerated to relativis-
tic energies in AR Sco system, and the pulse emission
is produced by the synchrotron radiation process. In 2-
12keV energy band, the detection of the pulsation is not
signiﬁcant with χ2/dof = 50/24 for the probability of a
ﬂat distribution.

Another interesting feature is the energy dependent
pulse fraction. The pulse fraction, which is deﬁned by
the equation (fmax − fmin)/(fmax + fmin), is measured
as ∼ 50% in the UV bands, while it is ∼ 14% in 0.15-
2keV energy bands, which is consistent with the upper
limit of 30% in Marsh et al. (2016). The small pulse frac-
tion shows that the DC level is the main component in
the X-ray emission. Moreover, the large orbital variation
synchronizing with the UV emission shows that DC com-
ponent is originated from the heated-side of the M-type
star, and there is a ∼ keV plasma around the M-type
star surface. The energy conversion from the magnetic
energy to the particle energy due to the magnetic re-
connection/dissipation on the M-type star is a possible
scenario to heat up/accelerate the plasma.

2.1.3. Pulse proﬁle; orbital evolution
The pulse emission from AR Sco is observed with the
beat frequency νB. This indicates that the position of
the pulse peak in the spin phase has a linear shift in
the orbital phase. To conﬁrm this, we make a dynamic
pulse proﬁle folded in the spin phase over the orbital
phase (upper panel in Figure 6).
In Figure 6, we can
clearly see the shift of the position of the pulse peak in
the spin phase for both OM (right panel) and EPIC (left
panel) data. However, an interesting feature can be seen
in the dynamic pulse proﬁle of the EPIC data; in the
right upper panel, the phase shift of the pulse peak at
Φob ∼ 0.2 − 0.5 orbital phase is slower than that in Φob ∼
0.5 − 1 orbital phase, and results in a discontinuity of the
peak position at the superior conjunction (Φob ∼ 0.5)

and inferior conjunction (Φob ∼ 0) of the orbit of the M-
type star. This interesting feature can also be seen in the
dynamic pulse proﬁles folded in the beat phase (lower
panel in Figure 6); in this case, the X-ray pulse peak
(right pane) shifts at the Φob ∼ 0.2 − 0.5 orbital phase,
while the peak position does not show a shift during the
Φob ∼ 0.5 − 1 orbital phase.

To investigate an evolution of the pulse proﬁle over the
orbit, we create orbitally resolved pulse proﬁles, folded
in spin phase, of the OM data and the EPIC data (Fig-
ure 7). In Figure 7, we can see that the pulse shapes in
both UV and X-ray bands evolve over the orbital phase.
On the other hand, we can also see that the pulse shape
and peak position in the UV/X-ray bands are similar
each other in most of the orbital phase. This observa-
tional result also supports the hypothesis that the pulse
emissions in the UV and X-ray bands are originated from
the same population of the particles.

In the UV bands, the double peak structure can be
clearly seen at most part of the orbital phase. Around
Φob ∼ 0.5 orbital phase (superior conjunction), however,
the pulse proﬁle is described by a broad single peak, and
the pulse shape drastically changes during Φob = 0.3−0.6
orbital phase, where the shift of the main peak position
in the spin phase is faster than other orbital phase. In
the X-ray bands, we also conﬁrm such a rapid change
in the behavior of the pulse proﬁle around the superior
conjunction.
In Figure 7, a large change in the pulse
proﬁle can be also seen around the inferior conjunction
(Φob ∼ 0).

An interesting feature is the large variation of the
pulse fraction over the orbital phase. For the UV bands,
the pulse fraction is maximum at the inferior conjunc-
tion (> 70%) and minimum at the superior conjunction
(∼ 40%). The X-ray emission also shows a similar trend,
although the uncertainty is large. For the OM data,
we ﬁt the pulse proﬁle with two Gaussian components,
and determine the DC level for each orbital phase. In
Figure 8, we can see that the DC component varies by
a factor of 6 over the orbital motion, while the pulsed
component changes by a factor of ∼ 4. For the pulsed
component, moreover, the count is almost constant dur-
ing Φob = 0.4 − 1.0 orbital phase. The diﬀerence in the
evolution of the photon count over the orbital phase sug-
gests that the emission region of the pulsed component
and DC level is diﬀerent. Since the DC level emission is
likely came from the entire surface of the day-side of the
M-type star, the pulsed component is produced in part of
the M-type star’s surface or at the WD’s magnetosphere.

2.2. Spectral analysis
2.2.1. Phase averaged spectrum

In order to further investigate the X-ray emission from
AR Sco, we carry out a spectral analysis with the EPIC
camera. We generate the spectra from photons in the
0.15-12keV energy bands within a radius of 20” circle
centered at the source. The background spectrum is gen-
erated from a source free region. The response ﬁles are
generated by the XMMSAS tasks rmf gen and arf gen.
We group the channels so as to archive the signal-to-noise
ratio S/N ≥ 3 in each energy bin with specgrop of SAS,
and use Xspec (version 12.9.1) to ﬁt the data.

The obtained spectra (Figure 9) clearly show a 6.8keV

emission line from He-like Fe. To ﬁt the EPIC data,
therefore, we adopt an optically thin thermal plasma
emission (VMEKAL in Xspec), which is a common spec-
tral model for the IPs. During the ﬁtting, we ﬁnd that
the current EPIC data can constrain only the abundance
of Fe, and therefore we ﬁx other elements at the solar
abundance. First, we ﬁt the data with a single temper-
ature model, and ﬁnd that the model cannot provide an
acceptable ﬁt (χ2 ∼ 713 for 410 dof). Adding a power-
law component or a disk component (diskbb in Xspec)
does not improve the results of the ﬁtting. Then we ﬁt
the data with two diﬀerent temperature components, and
ﬁnd that a two component model with kT1 ∼ 8.0keV
and kT2 ∼ 1.1keV can provide an acceptable ﬁt (Ta-
ble 1). In order to determine the number of VMEKAL
components with diﬀerent temperatures, we ﬁt the data
with three temperature and four temperature compo-
nent models. An improvement of the ﬁtting is found
by adding the third component with a F statistic value
of 14.1, which means that the probability of this im-
provement being caused by chance is 1.2 × 10−8. Less
signiﬁcant improvement is found for a fourth component
with a F -value of 1.8 or a change probability of 0.15.

Fig. 9.— X-ray spectra of AR Sco. Top; phase-average spectrum.
Bottom; spectrum of the pulsed component.

The best-ﬁt two and three temperature VMEKAL mod-
els are shown in Table 1. We do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant evi-
dence of a non-thermal component in the phase-averaged
spectrum. Since the X-ray ﬂux modulates over the orbit
(Figure 1), we evenly divide an one orbit into four parts
to investigate the evolution of the spectrum over the or-
bital phase. We do not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant change in the
orbitally phase-resolved spectra.

2.2.2. Spectrum of the pulsed component
It has been considered that the emission from radio
to UV bands is produced by the synchrotron radiation
of the relativistic electrons (Marsh et al. 2016). As de-
scribed in section 2.1, the pulse UV/X-ray emission is
originated from the same population of the plasma. To
examine the contribution of the non-thermal component
in the X-ray bands, we ﬁrst perform a phase-resolved
spectral analysis, and we compare the spectra at ’Phase1’
and at ’Phase 2’ in Figure 5. We ﬁnd that the phase-
resolved spectra for Phase 1/Phase 2 are well described
by an optically thin thermal plasma emission model, and
we do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the ﬁtting param-
eters of the two phases within 1σ error. This would be
because the pulse fraction is ∼ 14% and therefore the
phase-resolved spectrum is also dominated by the un-
pulsed component.

We then generate the spectrum of the pulsed com-
ponent by subtracting the spectrum of ’Phase 1’ from
that of ’Phase 2’. We remove the MOS1 data be-

Fig. 10.— Spectral energy distribution of AR Sco. The red
crosses and lines represent the spectrum of the time average and
of the pulsed component respectively. The radio/IR/Optical/UV
data were taken from Marsh et al. (2016). The blue and green lines
show the blackbody spectra for the M-type star (R∗ = 0.36R⊙,
T∗ = 3100K) and for the WD (RW D = 0.01R⊙, TW D = 97500K),
where we ignore the absorption of the blackbody emission by the
stellar atmosphere. The dashed line show the model spectrum of
the synchrotron emission by assuming the power law index of the
injected electrons of p = 3 [see Takata et al. (2018) for a detail].

cause of a small amount of the photon counts. Dur-
ing the ﬁtting, we ﬁx the hydrogen column density at
NH = 3.5 × 1020cm−3 from the phase-averaged spec-
trum. As a result, the power-law model can describe the
data reasonably well (χ2 = 8.97 for 12 dof). It yields a
soft emission with a photon index Γ = 2.3 ± 0.5 and an
−0.6 × 10−13erg cm−2s−1 in
unabsorbed ﬂux of FX = 3.7+0.7
0.15-2keV energy bands. An optical thin plasma emission
model (1 MEKAL model) also results in a comparable
goodness of the ﬁt. In this model, however, the ﬁtting
cannot constrain the parameters of the model, that is,
the error range is larger than the central value. Figure 10
shows the broad-band SED spectrum of AR Sco.

3. DISCUSSION
With d = 110pc, the X-ray luminosity is of the order
of LX ∼ 4 × 1030erg s−1, similar to LX ∼ 1031erg s−1
of AE Aquarii (Kitaguchi et al. 2014), but it is two to
three orders of magnitude lower than that of typical IPs.
One interesting feature of AR Sco is the weak absorp-
tion of the soft X-rays, which corresponds to NH ∼
lower than NH > 1022cm−2 observed
3 × 1020cm−2,
in many IPs (Yuasa et al. 2010). With the distance
d = 110pc of AR Sco, the column density will be mainly
contributed by the interstellar absorption. This also sup-
ports the hypothesis that most of the X-ray emission of
AR Sco is not produced as a result of the mass accretion
on the WD surface, as we have discussed in section 2.1.
Most of the X-ray emission of the AR Sco is produced
by the thermal plasma heated up to several keV. Since
there is no evidence of the accretion column for AR Sco,
an alternative plausible process is a magnetically interac-
tion between the WD and M-type star, such that a mag-
netic dissipation process eventually heats up/accelerates
the plasma on the M-star surface. When the WD’s mag-
netic ﬁeld lines sweep across the surface of the M-type

star, the magnetic interaction on the M-type star pro-
duces an azimuthal component of WD’s magnetic ﬁeld,
and the pitch η ≡ δBφ/B will increase at η → 1 before
the magnetic ﬁeld becomes unstable against the dissipa-
tion process. We estimate the rate of the energy dissipa-
tion as (Lai 2012; Buckley et al. 2017)

where µW D is the WD’s magnetic dipole moment, δ is
the skin depth (Buckley et al. 2017), and Ωs = 2π/Ps
is the spin angular frequency. Since the thermal com-
ponent of the X-ray emission is observed with a lumi-
nosity of ∼ 4 × 1030erg s−1, a small fraction of the dis-
sipation energy is converted into keV plasma. Most of
the dissipation energy would be used to accelerate the
electrons, and be radiated away by the synchrotron ra-
diation that has a peak at the IR/optical bands in the
spectral energy distribution and a synchrotron luminos-
ity of Lsyn ∼ LB ∼ 1032erg s−1.

An evidence of the non-thermal emission can be found
in the pulsed component, although the possibility of
the emission from the thermal plasma cannot be ruled
out. However the alignment of the pulse peaks in the
optical/UV/X-ray energy bands (three to four order of
magnitude in the energy) strongly supports the syn-
chrotron emission process of the non-thermal relativis-
tic electrons. The double peak structure in optica/UV
bands of AR Sco is similar to the Crab pulsar (isolated
young neutron star), for which the electrons/positrons
are accelerated by the electric ﬁeld parallel to the mag-
netic ﬁeld line, where the charge density deviates from
the Goldreich-Julian charge density. As pointed out by
Geng et al. (2016), however, the number of the parti-
cles that emit the observed pulse optical emissions of
AR Sco is signiﬁcantly larger than the number that can
be supplied by the WD itself. This suggests that the

 
 
 
 
8

synchrotron emitting electrons are supplied from the M-
type star surface, and the acceleration process is diﬀerent
from that of NS pulsars.

Magnetic reconnection on the M-type star is a pos-
sible process to produce the relativistic electrons. The
strength of the magnetic ﬁeld of the WD at the surface
of the M-type star is of the order of

where µW D is the magnetic moment of the WD. In
the observed SED (Figure 10), the spectral peak ap-
pears at Ep ∼ 0.1 − 1eV. If the observed pulse emis-
sion is originated from the M-type star surface, the
synchrotron radiation implies the typical Lorentz fac-
tor of γe ∼ 170(Bd/200G)−1/2(Ep/1eV)1/2. With the
Lorentz factor γe ∼ 170, on the other hand, the time
scale of the synchrotron loss around the M-type star
is τs ∼ 110s(Bd/200G)−2(γe/170)−1. Since the cool-
ing time scale is longer than the crossing time scale of
τc ∼ a/c ∼ 2.5s, the accelerated electrons on the M-type
star surface can migrate into the inner magnetosphere of
the WD along the magnetic ﬁeld of the WD before losing
their energy.

Takata et al. (2018) discuss that the observed pulse
emission is produced by the relativistic electrons trapped
by the closed magnetic ﬁeld lines of the WD. The accel-
erated electrons from the M-type star will move toward
the WD’s surface with the condition that τc < τs, and in-
crease the perpendicular momentum under the ﬁrst adia-
batic invariance. The electron is rebounded by the mag-
netic mirror eﬀect and returns to outer magnetosphere.
The synchrotron emission from the ﬁrst magnetic mirror
point after leaving the M-type star surface dominates
the emission from the subsequent mirror points, and are
observed as the pulse emission (Figure 11). In this sce-
nario, the pulse emission can be produced from the in-
clined rotator, for which the dipole magnetic axis and
the spin axis are not aligned; in Takata et al. (2018), the
spin axis of WD is assumed to be perpendicular to the

orbital plane. The electrons trapped into diﬀerent mag-
netic ﬁeld lines have diﬀerent travel time from the M-type
star surface to the ﬁrst magnetic mirror point. Due to
the diﬀerence in the travel times, the electrons injected
at the diﬀerent time may arrive the ﬁrst magnetic mirror
point simultaneously. This enhances the observed ﬂux
and this eﬀect becomes important for the electrons that
are injected around when the magnetic axis is laid within
the plane made by the spin axis and the direction of the
M-type star. Since the position of this plane relative to
the direction of the Earth shifts over the orbital phase,
the pulse peak also shifts in the spin phase, and results in
the formation of the beat frequency in the timing analy-
sis.

In summary, we have reported that the X-ray emis-
sion from AR Sco is modulating with the orbital phase
and with the beat phase. The X-ray orbital modula-
tion with a week absorption and synchronizing with the
UV emission suggests that the most of the emission is
originated from the M-type star surface, rather than the
WD’s surface similar to other IPs. We found that the
pulse shape of the X-ray emission is similar to that in
the optical/UV bands, and the peak position is aligned
in the optical/UV/X-ray bands. This is strong evidence
that the pulse emission is the non-thermal, and it is pro-
duced by the synchrotron radiation process of the rela-
tivistic electrons. In the X-ray data, the evidence of the
non-thermal emission can be seen in the spectrum of the
pulsed component. Our results support that AR Sco is
the new class of the WD binary system that continuously
produces the non-thermal radiation from the relativistic
electrons.
