Abstract 

Shear  stress  distribution  prediction  in  open  channels  is  of  utmost  importance  in  hydraulic 

structural engineering as it directly affects the design of stable channels. In this study, at first, 

a series of experimental tests were conducted to assess the shear stress distribution in prismatic 

compound channels. The shear stress values around the whole wetted perimeter were measured 

in  the  compound  channel  with  different  floodplain  widths  also  in  different  flow  depths  in 

subcritical  and supercritical  conditions.  A set  of, data mining  and machine learning  models 

including  Random  Forest  (RF),  M5P,  Random  Committee  (RC),  KStar  and  Additive 

Regression Model (AR) implemented on attained data to predict the shear stress distribution in 

the compound channel. Results indicated among these five models, RF method indicated the 

most precise results with the highest R2 value of 0.9. Finally, the most powerful data mining 

method which studied in this research (RF) compared with two well-known analytical models 

of  Shiono  and  Knight  Method  (SKM)  and  Shannon  method  to  acquire  the  proposed  model 

functioning in predicting the shear stress distribution. The results showed that the RF model 

has the best prediction performance compared to SKM and Shannon models.

1. Introduction 

In the design of hydraulic structures; the boundary shear stress distribution is an essential factor 

to understand most of the flow characteristics such as the flow resistances, sediment transport, 

and cavitation problems. It is suggested that, the stress distribution depends on some parameters 

such as the flume geometry, the hydraulic condition, the boundary roughness, particularly the 

streamwise velocity component and the secondary flow pattern (Chiu and Chiou, 1986; Chiu 

and Lin, 1983; Flintham and Carling, 1988; Ghosh and Roy, 1970; Knight et al., 1994). Since 

the compound cross section is the nearest section to the rivers, understanding the distribution 

of shear stress along the periphery of compound channels is essential. Furthermore, studying 

the river morphology and engineering the river bed and banks is dependent on it.  In addition, 

analysis  and  design  of  flood  control  structures  depends  on  extended  knowledge  on  the 

distribution of shear stresses in the flooding route. Literature includes various investigations 

considering different methods and case studies (Khatua and Patra, 2007; Knight and Hamed, 

1984; Naik and Khatua, 2016; Rezaei and Knight, 2010; Tominaga et al., 1989). Because of 

the  difficulty  and  time-consuming  of  direct  and  indirect  shear  stress  measurement,  many 

analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical methods have been currently developed (Shiono and 

Knight,  1988;  Khodashenas  and  Paquier,  1999;  Yang  and  Lim,  2005;  Yang  et  al.,  2012; 

Bonakdari et al., 2015; Sheikh Khozani et al., 2017a; Sheikh Khozani et al., 2017b). Rezaei 

and Knight (2009) modified the Shiono and Knight method (SKM) to predict the shear stress 

distribution  in  the  compound  channel  with  non-prismatic  floodplains.  Sheikh  Khozani  and 

Bonakdari  (2016)  compared  five  different  analytical  models  to  estimate  the  shear  stress 

distribution in  compound channels  with  prismatic rectangular  shapes. They investigated the 

performance of each model in estimating shear stress in each section of the compound channel. 

They  deducted  the  method  of  Tsallis  entropy  could  estimate  good  results  with  fewer 

calculations. 

Nowadays applying soft computing and data mining methods in forecasting different hydraulic 

and hydrology phenomena are in progress (Genç et al., 2015; Bonakdari et al., 2018; Sheikh 

Khozani et al., 2018a; 2018b; Azad et al., 2018; Jahanpanah et al., 2019; Sanikhani et al., 2019; 

Anitescu et al., 2019; Geo et al., 2019).  

Nowadays applying soft computing and data mining methods in forecasting different hydraulic 

and  hydrology  phenomena  are  in  progress.  In  estimating  shear  stress  distribution  Sheikh 

(Khozani  et  al.,  2017)  utilized  the  Randomize  Neural  Network  (RNN)  model  in  circular 

2 

 
channels  and  estimated their results with  results of the Shannon entropy. These researchers 

proposed a matrix-based equation. Khuntia et al. (2018) carried out a model of neural networks 

to predict the force applied to the walls in compound channel cross-sections. Sheikh Khozani 

et  al.  (2019)  applied  different  data  mining  models  to  estimate  apparent  shear  stress  in 

compound channels. They deducted that by using the Bagging-M5P model the more accurate 

results of apparent shear stress will be obtained. 

Based  on  the  knowledge  of  authors  there  is  few  studies  which  estimated  the  shear  stress 

distribution  in  compound  channels  by  using  data  mining  models.  Therefore,  a  set  of 

experiments were done in different flow depths and flow conditions then the extracted data was 

used to forecast the shear stress distribution in the smooth compound channel. About 1812 data 

of  shear  stress  applied  to  five  different  models  as  Additive  Regression  (AR),  M5P,  KStar, 

Random Forest (RF), and Random Committee (RC) models. The performance of each model 

in prediction of the distribution of shear stress is investigated, and the most accurate model is 

selected.  Also,  the  output  of  the  most  appropriate  model  is  compared  with  two  analytical 

models as Shiono and Knight (SKM) and Shannon model.  

2. Apparatus and Proceeding of Experiments  

In this study, the experiments are conducted utilizing a flume of 18m length. All experiments 

were performed in the flume with a simple rectangular cross-section compound channel. The 

flume width and depth are 1200 mm and 400 mm, respectively. The bed has a slope of S0 = 

2.003×10-3. The main channel dimensions are 398 mm, 50 , and 400 mm for width, depth, and 

floodplains  respectively,  has  been  constructed  with  PVC  material.  The  modulus  floodplain 

widths for the L-shaped aluminum sections in prismatic compound channels are 100 mm, 200 

mm,  300  mm  and  400  mm.  In  this  study,  the  distribution  of  shear  stress  in  the  prismatic 

compound channel with 100 mm floodplain width is investigated (see Figs.1 and 2).

In the expereinents, the uniform flow is controlled by a series of adjustable tailgates located in 

the end of the flume. OPC denotes, Overbank flow in the channel, the first three numbers after 

OPC refer to the floodplain width and two code numbers denoted the flow discharge. Local 

boundary shear stress was measured by using a Preston tube of 4.77 mm outer diameter, at the 

wetted channel perimeter at 25 mm transverse intervals on the bed and 10 mm vertical intervals

channel inlet). The range of hydraulic parameters of the experimental data is presented in Table

According to the results of different research the shear stress distribution in an smooth 

compound channel is related to geometry of channel (the width of floodplain, Bfp, Bmc, whole 

channel wetted perimeter (L)), the transverse coordinate (y), bankfull depth (h), depth of flow 

over main channel  (H), slope of channel bed (S0), flow velocity (V), fluid density (), 

gravitational acceleration (g) and hydraulic radius (R) then the dimensionless shear stress can 

be expressed as a function: 

In this study, the y/L, Bfp/Bmc, Fr, and H/h are as input variables which applied to each model 

and the dimensionless shear stress is the output variable.

3.1. Data mining methods 

Economist Michael Lovell who used the term "data mining" for the first time in the Review of 

Economic Studies (1983). Data mining is a process which discovers trends and patterns Han et 

al.  (2011).  Data  mining  is  a  subset  of  statistics  and  computer  science  with  the  mission  of 

discovering patterns in data sets with a goal to extract trends and information from a data set 

and to prepare the extracted information into a required structure for further application (Witten 

et al., 2016). 

On  the  other  hand,  in  addition  to  the  analysis  step,  it  contains  data  management,  inference 

consideration,  pre-processing  and  post-processing  of  data,  visualization  and  interestingness 

metrics  (Khuntia  et  al.  2018).  Data  mining,  unlike  data  analyzing,  employs  statistical  or 

machine learning techniques to  estimate, predict and  to  model  patterns of the target  dataset 

(Olson, 2007). Most common applications of data mining methods are Association learning, 

Anomaly detection, Cluster detection, classification, and Regression.  

3.1.1. Random forest 

Random  forests  (RFs)  are  methods  for  regression  and  classification  and  related  tasks  with 

constructing  a  multitude  of  decision  trees.  RFs  considered  in  ensemble  learning  method 

category.  This  method  was  first  introduced  by  Ho  (1995)  who  implemented  the  stochastic 

discrimination  to  classify  to  the  proposed  by  Eugene  Kleinberg  using  the  random  subspace 

method  (Barandiaran,  1998).  An  extension  of  the  RFs  algorithm  has  been  registered  as  a 

trademark (Breiman, 2001). In another study by Sun et al. (2018), a new RFs algorithm has 

been  proposed  for  classification  based  on  cooperative  game  theory,  on  the  other  hand,  the 

evaluation  of  each  feature  power  was  performed  using  Banzhaf  power  index  which  was 

traversing possible coalitions of the feature. In another study, Chen et al. (2018) proposed an 

adaptive variable step method based on RFs. This method from one hand was able to accelerate 

the training process and on the other hand, can decrease the gain of calculations of information. 

Based on evidence and documentation, the proposed approach was suitable to be applied in the 

most decision tree-based models. 

In this study the optimum parameter settings of RF models including of batchsize, maximum 

depth of tree, number of decimal places, number execution slots, number of features, number 

of iterations, and number of seeds are 100, 0, 2, 1, 0, 100 and 4 respectively.

3.1.2. M5P Model 

M5P algorithm is first introduced by Quinlan (1992). This method is the upgraded version of 

the M5 algorithm. Model trees can effectively handle large data sets, and in case of dealing 

with missing data, they are robust.  

Based on Fig. 1, which shows the schematic diagram of the M5 algorithm, the process first 

split the input data (or input space) into subspaces.  

Fig. 3. The schematic diagram of M5 algorithm. 

Figure 3 demonstrates the input space which has been divided into subspaces S1, S2, and S3. 

The minimization of the variation is performing by the use of linear regression approaches. 

After  this  step,  in  order  to  create  a  tree-like  structure,  information  of  the  previous  step  is 

imported  to  build  several  nodes.  In  this  step,  the  standard  deviation  reduction  (SDR)  is 

employed to reduce the error at the node (Eq. 1) (Wang and Witten, 1996): 

𝑆𝐷𝑅 = 𝑠𝑑(𝑆) − ∑

-  S = dataset which reaches to the node,

(1) 

 
 
 
 
 
-  Si= subspaces 

-  Sd= the standard deviation 

Lower SDR than the expected error creates over-training problems. To overcome this problem, 

there is a need for a smoothing process for the combination of all the models from the root to 

the leaf. This establishes the final model of the leaf. Finally, the resulted values of data from 

leaf  are  combined  with  the  predicted  values  using  linear  regression  for  that  node  (Eq.  2) 

(Behnood et al., 2017):

In this paper the optimum parameter settings of M5P models including of batchsize, number 

of decimal places, number of instance and number of seeds are 100, 0, 2, 4, and 3 

respectively. 

3.1.3. K-Star model (K*) 

K* model or in other word K* algorithm as an Instance-based Learner and a memory-based 

classifier was presented by Cleary and Trigg (1995) in a conference proceedings of machine 

learning. The distance metric for K* technique has been performed by employing the entropy 

concept. Therefore, it can be claimed that the transformation probability occurs in a “random 

walk  away”  manner.  Summing  the  probabilities  classifies  the  K*.  Generally,  there  is  not 

enough evidence about how K* faces class noisy and attribute, and with the attributes mixed 

values in the datasets (Tejera Hernández, 2015). 

In order to specify the K* technique, we have (Eq. 3 to Eq. 5):

0 ≤

𝑝(𝑡̅𝑢)
𝑝(𝑡̅)

≤ 1 

∑ 𝑝(𝑡̅𝑢) = 𝑝(𝑡̅)

𝑝(𝐴) = 1 

 It satisfies Eq. 6 as a consequence: 

∑ 𝑝(𝑡̅𝑢) = 1
𝑡̅𝜖𝑃

Eq. 7 defines the probability function P*: 

𝑃∗(𝑏|𝑎) = ∑ 𝑝(𝑡̅)

𝑡̅𝜖𝑃:𝑡̅(𝑎)=𝑏

The following properties have been satisfied by P*: 

∑ 𝑃∗(𝑏|𝑎) = 1
𝑏

0 ≤ 𝑃∗(𝑏|𝑎) ≤ 1 

Finally, the K* function will be defined as Eq. 9: 

𝐾∗(𝑏|𝑎) = − log2 𝑃∗(𝑏|𝑎)

In this study the optimum parameter settings of KStar models including of batchsize, global 

blend, and minimum number of places, are 100, 1, and 1 respectively.

3.1.4. Additive regression method  

This method is a nonparametric regression method which was first introduced by Friedman and 

Stuetzle  (1981).  This  method  is  known  as  an  essential  part  of  the  alternating  conditional 

expectations  algorithm.  The  alternating  conditional  expectations  algorithm  employs  a  one-

dimensional smoother (𝑓𝑗(𝑥𝑖𝑗) in Eq. 10) to create a class of non-parametric regression models 

(Eq. 10). This make the method smoother than a p-dimensional method. This technique is also 

more  flexible  compared  with  that  for  a  standard  linear  model,  but  is  more  interpretable 

compared with that for a general regression surface. Multicollinearity, overfitting and model 

selection are consodered as application fields for an additive reggression method. 

By considering {𝑦𝑖, 𝑥𝑖1, … , 𝑥𝑖𝑝}, (i=1 to n) as data-set for n units, which xi indicates estimators 

and yi reperesents the outcome value, the additive model is as Eq. 10: 

𝐸[𝑦𝑖|𝑥𝑖1, … , 𝑥𝑖𝑝] = 𝑌

𝑝

= 𝛽0 + ∑ 𝑓𝑗(𝑥𝑖𝑗)
𝑗=1

+ 𝜀 

(10) 

Fitting the Additive regression method can be performed by the use of the backfitting algorithm 

presented by. Yoshida (2018) employed a semiparametric method to explore the structure of 

additive regression models 

The optimum parameter settings of AR models including of number of itration and shrinkage 

are 12 and 1 respectively. 

3.1.5. Random Committee  

Random  committee  belongs  to  the  category  of  committee  machines  which  works  based  on 

ensemble of predictors, e.g. ANNs, decision trees (Hwang and Hu, 2001). Thus, it is considered 

as an ensemble classifier which work on the basis of classification for accoplish the training. It 

is made using a learning mechanism which predicts the committees of the new inputs. The new 

imputs  are  generated  through  the  integration  of  the  estimation  of  every  single  committee 

members. The random committee functions as a meta-learning technique using a number of 

randomized  classifiers.  The  average  of  estimation  achieved  each  classifier  of  Random 

committee provides the final classification result.   

10 

 
 
 
 
Hwang  and  Hu  (2001)  documented  the  concept  of  Random  Committee.  He  described  the 

architecture  and  algorithm  where  some  Base  classifiers  are  constructed  using  a  different 

number of random seeds. Furthermore, an estimation average generated through every base 

classifier form the final value for the prediction.

expert neural networks. 

By assuming x as input variable and y as output variable vectors, f(x) and P(y|f(x)) will be

respectively function and conditional density. By considering 𝑋𝑞   =   {𝑥1

NQ  test  points  and  let  fq  =  (fq  1  ,...,fq  NQ  )  as  the  vector  of  the  corresponding  unknown 

response variables and by spliting up the input data set into M sets of data D = {D1,...,DM} and 

by denoting the data which are not in Di as 𝐷̅𝑖   =  𝐷/𝐷𝑖 we will have in general: 

P(f q|D̅i , Di )   ∝  P(f q)P(D̅i|f q)P(Di |D̅i , f q) 

(12) 

It can be approximated Eq. 13: 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
P(Di |D̅i , f q) ≈ P(Di |f q) 

Now the combination of Bayes’ formula and approximation generates Eq. 14: 

P(f q|Di−1, D̅i) ≈ Const ×

P(f q |Di−1)P(f q|Di)
P(f q)

approximate predictive density is calculated as Eq.15: 

P̂(f q|D) = Const ×

The  above  integration  of  the  committee  members  predictions  ressembles  the  Bayesian 

committee machine (Hwang and Hu, 2001). 

The optimum parameter settings of RC models of Batchsize, number of decimal places, number 

Execution slots, number of itration, and number of seed are 100, 1, 1, 15 and 1 respectively. 

3.2. Analytical models 

3.2.1. SKM Model 

The Navier–Stokes equation for a fluid element in steady uniform flow can be written as: 

(18) 

12 

zygSzwwyuvzxyx++=+0 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where S0 is bed slope, u, v and w are local velocities. The 

and 

 represent the Reynolds 

stresses. Furthermore, g and ρ are gravitational acceleration and fluid density, respectively. 

An analytical solution for the Navier–Stokes equation to predict the lateral variation of the 

depth-averaged velocity in compound channels proposed earlier by Shiono and Knight 

(1988). It accounts for the 3D flow by the use of depth-integrated parameters to simplify its 

use as follow:  

(19) 

Where s is the channel side wall slope. H, Ud, 

, f, and y are the local flow depth, the depth-

averaged velocity, the dimensionless eddy viscosity, the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor and 

the lateral coordinate, respectively. Shiono and Knight (1988) proposed an analytical 

solution, initially ignoring the secondary flow term on the other side of the Equation (19). 

They concluded that by ignoring the current secondary term, the velocity profile could be 

determined relatively accurate. By increasing the bed friction, f, or the turbulent friction, 

 

the relationship between the depth-averaged velocity and bed shear stress might be 

jeopardized in such a way that it became impossible to get a prediction of both profiles 

accurately at the same time. 

Shiono and Knight (1991) proposed a secondary current model in order to improve the 

analytical results. From experimental results, they came to conclusion that within certain 

regions of the flow, the depth-averaged term on the right-hand side of differential Equation 

(19) varied linearly in the y-direction on the floodplains and in the main channel, in such a 

way, that its derivative could be replaced by the constant, , in the main channel and on the 

floodplains. Hence 

(20) 

(21) 

For a flat bed region (

), the differential Equation (21) may be written as follow 

13

(22) 

According to Shiono and Knight (1991), the analytical solution of Equation (22) for a prismatic 

compound channel with a flat bed region and vertical side walls is expressed as follows: 

(23) 

where 

; 

 and 

At an interface between selected panels, different boundary conditions can be used to determine 

the unknown parameters A. 

Having the depth-averaged velocity, the bed shear stress can be calculated as: 

(24) 

It should be noted that the SKM is not able to model shear stress distribution on the 

rectangular compound channels walls. 

3.2.2. Shannon Model 

Based on the Shannon entropy concept, (Sterling and Knight, 2002) extended equations to 

estimate shear stress distribution in channels. They proposed equations for predicting shear 

stress distribution along the wetted perimeter in the circular channel without flat bed. Also 

they presented equations to forecast the shear stress distribution in wall and bed of 

trapezoidal and circular channels with sediment separately. Sheikh Khozani and Bonakdari 

(2016) used these models for estimating shear stress distribution to compare with other 

analytical models. The suggested equations by Sterling and Knight are as bellows:

(26) 

where 

 and 

 are shear stress values for wall and bed of floodplain or main channel 

respectively, 

 and 

 are the maximum shear stress values for wall and bed 

respectively. Pb and Pw is the wall and bed wetted perimeter respectively, yw is an offset taken 

as 5 mm in the study of Sterling and Knight (2002) and 

 are the Lagrange multipliers 

related to wall and bed of compound channel subsections respectively which calculated as: 

(27) 

(28) 

Which ρ is the fluid density, g is the gravity acceleration, R is the hydraulic radius and S0 is 

the channel slope. In order to compute the maximum shear stress distribution, the proposed 

relations by Knight et al. (1994) these equations were utilized in studies of other researchers 

such as Bonakdari et al. (2015), Sheikh and Bonakdari (2015), and Sheikh Khozani and 

Bonakdari (2018). 

4. Models performance evaluation 

According to Dawson et al., (2007) using one statistical criterion is not suitable for evaluating 

a model. To investigate the performance of each model for estimating the shear stress 

distribution in compound channels four commonly used criteria were utilized. These applied 

criteria are as coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE), Mean 

Absolute Error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and BIAS. These statistical indexes 

are calculated as:

which xip is the predicted shear stress values by models, xio is the observed shear stress values 

in the laboratory, 

 and 

 are the mean value of shear stress values which observed and 

predicted respectively and n is the number of samples.  

These indexes were used by Sheikh Khozani et al. (2019) to investigate the model 

performances in modeling apparent shear stress in compound channels. 

5. Results and discussion 

5.1. Selection the best statistical model 

All five mentioned models were applied to shear stress distribution data which was measured 

in a straight rectangular compound channel. About 1812 data was used in the modeling 

procedure that 70% were used for the training stage and 30% for the testing stage. The results 

of the testing stage are shown in Figure 5 as a scatter plot and hydrograph. According to the 

results of this figure, the Additive Regression Model predicted the worst results of shear 

stress distribution with R2 of 0.6745. As seen in Figure 5 the Additive Regression Model 

predicted the same values of shear stress in different y/P in each test. Also based the results of 

hydrograph this model could not able estimate shear stress in the whole wetted perimeter. 

The M5P and KStar models show the same results to somewhat. As seen in hydrograph these 

models are weak in predicting the maximum and minimum shear stresses in walls and beds of 

main channel and floodplains, but for other y/P they show more accurate results than the 

Additive Regression Model. The RC and RF models’ predictions for the maximum and 

minimum shear stress values are better than those of other models. It clearly is seen from the 

scatter plot of Figure 5 that the RF Model with R2 of 0.9003 demonstrated the most precise 

results than the AR, KStar, M5P, and RC models. Therefore, the predictions of the RF Model 

will be compared with two mentioned analytical models (the SKM and the Shannon models) 

in the next section.

5.2. Comparison of the models 

To estimate the shear stress distribution in a prismatic compound channel with rectangular 

cross-section five different data mining methods were investigated. Based on the results the 

RF model performed superior to those of other models in all subsections of the compound 

channel. In this section, the performance of the RF model is compared with the ability of the 

Shannon and SKM models in forecasting the shear stress distribution. Figure 6 demonstrates 

the comparison between two analytical models and the RF model. As seen in Figures 6a and 

b the SKM model shows better performance in predicting the shear stress in the bed of the 

main channel than the bed of floodplains. As we know the SKM model only can estimate the 

bed shear stress and this model is not able to predict wall shear stresses. Based on the results 

of Fig. 6 using the SKM model overestimated values obtain for bed shear stress of the main 

channel and underestimated values calculate for the shear stress of bed of floodplains. With 

increasing the width of floodplains, the accuracy of the SKM model predictions for the bed of 

the main channel was decreased. 

On the other hand, in higher floodplain width the shear stress predictions values for the bed of 

floodplain are more precise. Also, when the width of floodplain increased, the SKM model 

estimates the pattern of shear stress for the bed of floodplain with higher accuracy as seen in 

Figures 6e, f, g, and h. The performance of the Shannon model is better than the SKM model. 

In all sub-sections, the Shannon model predictions are overestimated, but this model performs 

19 

 
 
 
better for estimating wall shear stress than bed shear stress. When the width of floodplains is 

equal to 100 mm, the performance of the Shannon model is the same as the SKM model for 

main  channel  bed  shear  stress  to  somewhat.  With  increasing  the  width  of  floodplains,  the 

results of the SKM model become weaker than the Shannon model. Between three mentioned 

models the RF model illustrates the best results with higher accuracy as seen in Fig 6. By using 

the RF model in addition to the most accurate predictions of shear stress distribution in the 

whole wetted perimeter, the model could estimate the pattern of shear stress distribution very 

well. In modeling with the RF model only using the hydraulic parameters of channel as y/L, 

Fr, H/h and Bfp/Bmc the shear stress values can estimated in whole channel boundary while in 

the  Shannon  entropy  it  needs  to  compute  the  Lagrange  multiplier  and  the  results  are  not 

accurate as the RF model. In addition in the SKM model we can only estimate the bed shear 

stress and it needs to calculate the average depth velocity and computing the shear stress needs 

to time-consuming procedure.

The statistical results of comparison between the RF, Shannon and SKM models are tabulated 

in  Table  3.  As  we  know,  the  lower  values  of  RMSE  and  MAE  indexes  shows  the  higher 

performance  of  models  to  forecast  a  specific  phenomenon.  As  mentioned  before  the  SKM 

model predict bed shear stress of floodplains and the main channel, in Table 3 the results of the 

SKM model contains only these predictions. According to the results of this table, the RF model 

with  lower  values  of  RMSE  and  MAE  indicates  the  best  results  of  estimating  shear  stress 

distribution in compound channels. The Shannon entropy model performs better than the SKM 

model in predicting shear stress values. The values of NSE demonstrates the performance of 

model which graded as very good for 0.75 <NSE≤ 1, good for 0.65 <NSE≤ 0.75, satisfactory 

for 0.5 <NSE≤ 0.65, acceptable for 0.4 <NSE≤ 0.5, and unsatisfactory for NSE ≤0.4. As seen 

in Table 3 for the RF model the obtained values of NSE are higher than 0.95, therefore, the RF 

model  has  a  perfect  grade  for  estimating  shear  stress  values.  For  estimating  shear  stress 

distribution values in OPC-100, OPC-200, OPC-300, and OPC-400 the results of the RF model 

are most precise with RMSE of 0.0166, 0.0255, 0.0338, and 0.0518 respectively in comparison 

with the Shannon and the SKM models. All in all, based the results of Figure 6 and Table 3 the 

RF model is  the most robust model between mentioned models in  this study for estimating 

shear stress distribution in compound channels. It is worth addition that R2, RMSE, MAE, NSE, 

and BIAS which are used to estimate how good regression models are, in some cases, they can 

overestimate (or underestimate) the training data. To overcome these issues (overestimation 

and underestimation), Bayesian methods can be used to improve the regression model (Vu-Bac 

et al. 2014, 2015, 2016).

6. Conclusion 

In this research, the authors have investigated on shear stress distribution on the  compound 

channel. Series of experiments were performed in prismatic simple rectangular cross-section 

compound channels of floodplain 100 mm, 200mm, 300mm and 400 mm width using flume of 

the University of Birmingham. The results have used for five different data mining method to 

predict the shear stress distribution; AR, M5P, KStar, RC and RF models. The AR model with 

R2 of 0.6745 was not able to estimate shear stress in whole wetted perimeter accurately. The 

M5P  and  KStar  models  did  not  show  appropriate  results  in  predicting  the  maximum,  and 

minimum shear stresses in walls and beds of main channel and floodplains, however for other 

locations of perimeter they showed more accurate outcomes rather than the AR model. The 

maximum and minimum shear stress values can be predicted better with the RC and RF models 

in comparison with the other models. The RF Model can predict the results with R2 of 0.9003 

which  is  the  most  precise  prediction  among  other  statistical  models.  Shannon  and  SKM 

analytical model have been compared with RF model, the SKM model is able to predict bed 

shear  stress  of  floodplains  and  the  main  channel  better  than  wall  shear  stresses,  however, 

Shannon  model  can  predict  wall  shear  stresses  more  accurately.  The  accuracy  of  the  SKM 

model predictions for the main channel bed decreases by increasing the floodplains width. The 

shear  stress  predictions  values  for  the  floodplain  bed  are  more  meticulous  in  broader 

24 

 
 
 
floodplains. The results showed that the RF machine learning model has the lower values of 

RMSE and MAE in comparison with the two famous accurate analytical models’ prediction of 

shear stress distribution in the whole wetted perimeter. Random Forest modeling technique can 

estimate the shear stress values in whole channel boundaries using the hydraulic parameters of 

y/L, Fr, H/h and Bfp/Bmc while, Lagrange multiplier and average depth velocity is needed in the 

Shannon entropy, and SKM model, respectively and the results are not as accurate as the RF 

model.
