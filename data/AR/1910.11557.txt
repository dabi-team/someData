ABSTRACT

Context. MHD waves are proposed to transport suﬃcient energy from the photosphere to heat the

transition-region (TR) and corona. However, various aspects of these waves such as their nature,

propagation characteristics and role in the atmospheric heating process remain poorly understood

and are a matter of further investigation.

Aims. We aim to investigate wave propagation within an active-region (AR) plage using IRIS and

AIA observations. The main motivation is to understand the relationship between photospheric

and TR oscillations. We plan to identify the locations in the plage region where magnetic ﬂux

tubes are essentially vertical, and further our understanding of the propagation and nature of

these waves.

Methods. We have used photospheric observations from AIA (i.e., AIA 1700 Å) as well as TR

imaging observations (IRIS/SJI Si iv 1400.0 Å). We have investigated propagation of the waves

into the TR from the photosphere using wavelet analysis (e.g., cross power, coherence and phase

diﬀerence) with inclusion of a customized noise model.

Results. Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) shows the distribution of wave power at photospheric &

TR heights. Waves with periods between 2.0- and 9.0-minutes appear to be correlated between the

photosphere and TR. We exploited a customized noise model to estimate 95% conﬁdence levels

for IRIS observations. On the basis of the sound speed in the TR and estimated propagation

speed, these waves are best interpreted as the slow magneto acoustic waves (SMAW). It is found

that almost all locations show correlation/propagation of waves over broad range of period from

photosphere to TR. It suggests the wave’s correlation/propagation spatial occurrence frequency

is very high within the plage area.

1. Introduction

Understanding wave propagation is a very important topic in solar physics as these waves can

transport energy into the upper layers of the Sun’s atmosphere. The energies carried by these

waves can play a crucial role in the heating of the interface region and inner corona. The interface-

region heating can not be fully understood without understanding/characterizing the wave propa-

gation and the eﬀect of the complex solar atmosphere on it. The plasma conditions, perturbations,

and structured magnetic ﬁelds, lead to a complex behavior of waves in magnetic ﬂux-tube. Us-

ing observations from diﬀerent instruments as well as numerical simulations, there are several

reports that shed light on various aspects of the waves (e.g., origin, properties, and dynamics) and

their propagation throughout the solar atmosphere (De Moortel et al. 2000, 2002; De Pontieu et al.

2003; Centeno et al. 2006, 2009; Jelínek & Karlický 2009; Jess et al. 2012; Jelínek & Murawski

2013; Jelínek et al. 2015; Krishna Prasad et al. 2015; Murawski et al. 2018; Kayshap et al. 2018).

In sunspot umbra, 3-minute waves propagate up to the chromosphere from the photosphere as

reported by Centeno et al. (2006, 2009) using spectropolarimetric observations. Interface-Region

Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS) observations have shown that the 3-minute oscillations can propa-

gate within umbra up to the TR and corona (Tian et al. (2014); Khomenko & Collados (2015)). In

magnetic "free-regions" (i.e., inter-network), the propagation of 3-minute waves is widely reported

(e.g.,Lites et al. 1982; Wikstøl et al. 2000; Judge et al. 2001; Bloomﬁeld et al. 2004; Kayshap et al.

2018). Using IRIS high-resolution observations, Kayshap et al. (2018) explored the propagation of

3 minute oscillations in the inter-network. The propagation of low frequencies (5-minute) from the

photosphere to the higher layers have also been reported in a small magnetic patch by Srivastava et al.

(2008).

In coronal loops, De Moortel et al. (2002) have proposed that the photospheric oscillations (specif-

ically, 3 & 5 minutes) can reach up to the TR/coronal heights. It has been proposed that these

are diﬀerent manifestations of slow magneto acoustic waves (SMAW) in coronal loops (Jess et al.

2012; Krishna Prasad et al. 2015). Using TRACE observations, it is has also been reported that pho-

tospheric power (p-mode) can reach the TR within the plage atmosphere (De Pontieu et al. 2005)

and the interaction of p-mode with the magnetic ﬁeld generates magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)

wave modes (Spruit 1991; Cally et al. 1994; Jess et al. 2015). The magnetic ﬁeld acts as a guide

for the waves to reach up to coronal heights (Cally 2007; De Pontieu et al. 2003, 2005).

Almost all the works that investigate wave propagation use wavelet analysis for the study of phase

relations. The ﬁrst and most fundamental necessity is has to do with the reliability of the wave

periods that are detected through wavelet analysis. The reliability of the period depends on the

conﬁdence levels that are measured with the help of the assumed theoretical spectrum. The white

noise (i.e., ﬂat spectrum with no frequency dependency) is most widely used theoretical spectrum

to calculate the conﬁdence levels. However, the white noise does not represent the true noise in-

herited in the signal of the solar atmospheric. The use of an incorrect noise model may lead to

the false detection of wave periods (Auchère et al. 2016; Threlfall et al. 2017). It has been reported

that the Fourier spectra of coronal signals behave as a power-law (e.g., Auchère et al. 2014; Gupta

2014; Inglis et al. 2015; Ireland et al. 2015). The power-law like nature of Fourier/wavelet spectra

(i.e., P ∝ f−α) is characteristic of red noise when the exponent value is -2. The exponent values may

vary from one time-series to another. Therefore, we emphasize the importance and necessity of the

power-law model for the estimation of the conﬁdence levels (e.g., Gabriel et al. 2002a; Vaughan

2005; Auchère et al. 2016; Pugh et al. 2017). Finally, we would like to mention that Auchère et al.

(2016) have beautifully justiﬁed the necessity of power law (along with kappa function and con-

stant background) to detect wave periods in coronal loops. Our work follows Auchère et al. (2016)

to calculate the conﬁdence levels using a power-law function.

The main motivation of our work is to identify the nature of wave motions and their propagation

properties in an active-region plage area using high-resolution observations from IRIS (De Pontieu et al.

2014). The work is organized as follows. Sect. 2 describes the observational data and analy-

sis. Sect. 3 describes the deduced results under three diﬀerent subsections. The ﬁrst subsection

(Sect. 3.1) is dedicated to Fourier maps of plages in the diﬀerent frequency bins. The second sub-

section (Sect. 3.2) describes the wavelet analysis and associated results using SDO/AIA 1700 Å

(Lemen et al. 2012) and IRIS/SJI 1400 Å. In the ﬁnal subsection (Sect. 3.3), we investigate the

nature of SMAW waves in the plage region. In the last section, discussion and conclusions are out-

lined. In addition, appendix-A discusses the diagnostics that dominate the emission in the IRIS/SJI

1400 Å channel.

2. Observational Data & Analysis

IRIS observed an active-region plage on 28 July 2014 from approximately 17:59 UT to 19:52 UT.

IRIS captures the solar spectra in the near and far ultraviolet, which includes many photospheric

and chromospheric/TR lines, e.g., Mn i 2803.8 Å, Mg ii k 2796 Å, C ii 1334.53 Å, Si iv 1393.75 Å.

In this study we have used mainly the IRIS/Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) at 1400 Å, Si iv 1393.75 Å, and

AIA 1700 Å. In addition, we have also utilized magnetic ﬁeld inclination and line-of-sight (LOS)

information from HMI. At the time of the observations, the AR plage was located at disk center

(i.e., very close to µ = 1.0). The on-disk observations minimize projection eﬀects (Falconer et al.

(2016)). However, another possibility of projection eﬀects comes due to the inclination of magnetic

ﬁeld which can lead to oﬀsets at diﬀerent heights.

AIA 1700 Å imaging observations sample the emission from the upper photosphere, while IRIS/SJI

P. Kayshap et al.: Propagation of Waves above a Plage as Observed by IRIS and SDO

Si iv 1400 Å is dominated by a spatially varying mix of upper photospheric continuum and low TR

emission. The IRIS/SJI 1400 Å ﬁlter is a broadband ﬁlter with a width of 55 Å, and is dominated

by continuum emission in the vicinity of two strong Si iv lines. Therefore, this ﬁlter can also

capture some photospheric emission. In order to check the parts of the atmosphere that contribute

to the emission in the IRIS/SJI (i.e., photosphere or TR), we have investigated the IRIS/SJI 1400 Å

observations in conjunction with Si iv. Using this analysis we found that the IRIS/SJI 1400 ﬁlter is

dominated by the TR emission in the plage area. However, we did not ﬁnd a well deﬁned correlation

between SJI 1400 and Si iv line in the surrounding quiet-Sun. This suggests that our region of

interest (ROI) is dominated by the TR emission. More information is provided in appendix A

Figure 1 shows AIA 1700 Å (panel a) and IRIS/SJI 1400 Å (panel b) images of the observed

plage region. We also show the LOS photospheric magnetic ﬁeld (panel c) and ﬁeld inclination

angles (panel d). Strong magnetic ﬁelds are evident in the vicinity of the plage. The inclination

angle from these plage locations varies from zero (i.e., vertical magnetic ﬁeld in the central areas)

to 70-80 degrees (at the outer edges). However, we are interested in the vertical magnetic ﬁeld

locations within these plage areas. Therefore, we have put a threshold of magnetic ﬁeld (i.e., higher

than 300 G) to identify the vertical magnetic ﬁeld plage locations (VMPLs). The identiﬁed plage

locations are overdrawn by green contours on the inclination map (panel d). The inclination angles

are very low within the VMPLs, which justiﬁes that the magnetic ﬁeld is essentially vertical. After

identiﬁcation of VMPLs, we extracted the time-series (TS) from AIA 1700 Å and IRIS/SJI 1400 Å

data.

3. Results

We investigate wave propagation between the photosphere and the TR in the VMPLs. We utilize

wavelet transform (e.g., cross wavelet transform, coherence, and phase diﬀerence) for this work.

However, before presenting the wavelet analysis & the associated results, we present Fourier power

maps of the plage region. This provides the wave power distribution within the plage-region at two

diﬀerent heights (i.e., AIA 1700 Å and IRIS 1400 Å).

3.1. Plage’sFourier Maps

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the plage observations is performed in AIA 1700 Å (i.e., pho-

tosphere) and IRIS 1400 Å (TR). The FFT provides the power spectral density (i.e., wave power

vs frequency) over a particular solar region, e.g., plage in the present work. We have normalized

the Fourier power as explained in the way Gabriel et al. (2002b) and used by Froment et al. (2015)

and Auchère et al. (2016). Based on this methodology we estimate the scaling factor (i.e., m as

deﬁned in previous works) corresponding to the used conﬁdence levels. We estimate the scaling

factor value to be 8.41 for conﬁdence levels of 95%, i.e., if the power is higher than 8.41 then

the conﬁdence level is above 95%. Using the value of the scaling factor (i.e., m) and estimated

noise we derived the ﬁnal array (i.e., m*estimated noise) to normalize the Fourier power for each

ﬁeld inclination map (panel d) of the same region using SDO/HMI observations. High magnetic ﬁeld and low
inclination angles are visible within the vicinity of the plage area. We have selected the plage locations using a
threshold of absolute magnetic ﬁeld (i.e., above 300 Gauss) and locations are contoured (i.e, above 300 Gauss)
over magnetic ﬁled inclination (panel d) by green color which reveal the presence of almost vertical (or very
low inclination) ﬁelds.

pixel. Finally, we estimated the normalized power maps for each frequency at each location in

the observed region. In order to highlight the wave power distribution in the observed region, we

selected three diﬀerent frequency ranges, namely,(1) high-frequency range – 11.04 mHz (period:

1.5 minutes), (2) intermediate frequency range – 5.31 mHz (period: 3.10 minutes), and (3) low

frequency range – 1.64 mHz (periods: 10.15 minutes). We extracted 2-D Fourier maps (for these 3

selected frequencies) for AIA 1700 Å and IRIS 1400 Å. The 2-D Fourier maps for both channels

are shown in Fig. 2.

High Frequency: In Fig. 2, we have shown the Fourier power map in the high frequency range

(i.e, 11.04 mHz) for AIA 1700 Å (panel a) and IRIS 1400 Å (panel b). The observed area contains

mostly a plage region along with the surrounding region at the edges of images (see Fig. 1). The

normalized Fourier power maps show uniform distribution of the power of the waves in the plage

and the surrounding area at both heights in the solar atmosphere (e.g., AIA 1700 Å & IRIS 1400 Å).

Therefore, we do observe that the behavior of the plage & surrounding region is almost similar at

this high-frequency. However, it should be noted that power is very low at the photosphere (panel

A) and TR (panel B). Furthermore, TR power is slightly lower than the photospheric power.

Intermediate Frequency: The middle row of Fig. 2 shows Fourier power map of the photosphere

(panel C) and TR (panel D) for intermediate frequency (i.e., 5.31 mHz). Particularly, this is in the

frequency regime where most of the wave power is inherited and propagates into the higher layers.

The pattern of photospheric wave power at intermediate frequency is completely diﬀerent from

the behavior that we found in high frequencies. We see that power in the surrounding region is

marginally higher than the inherited power in the plage. A similar behavior exists in TR heights,

however, the pattern is not as prominent as at the photospheric level.

Low Frequency: The bottom row of Fig. 2 shows the Fourier power map of the photosphere (panel

E) and TR (panel F) at low frequency (i.e., 1.64 mHz). At this frequency range, we do not see any

diﬀerence between the plage and surroundings at the photospheric (panel E) and TR levels (panel

F).

3.2. Wavelet Analysis

A wavelet transform involves the convolution between the TS and the "mother" function. There are

diﬀerent type of "mother" functions with the Wavelet transform (e.g., Morlet, Paul and Derivative

of Gaussian (DOG)). For the present analysis, we have used the Morlet mother function with a

dimensionless frequency ω0 = 6, which is suitable for investigating the propagation of waves with

a range of frequencies. The Morlet function consists of the plane wave which is modulated by a

Gaussian window.

Fig. 3. The generic noise model for AIA 1700 (panel a and c) and IRIS/SJI 1400 (panel b and d). The FFT
power spectrum (black line), time averaged wavelet spectrum (red line), and ﬁtted noise model (green line)
are shown in each panel. Using ﬁtted noise, we have drawn local and global 95% conﬁdence levels, which are
shown by blue and pink colors respectively. The parameters used for the ﬁts parameters also provided. The
low χ2 values justify the reliability of the ﬁtted noise model on the FFT power spectrum.

Eq. 1 describes the Morlet function,where ω0 and η are the non dimensional frequency and time pa-

rameters. The wavelet transform provides a 2-D complex array for a TS. The power of the wavelet

is deﬁned as the square of absolute magnitude of the complex wavelet. We have shown intensity TS

and wavelet power maps (i.e., |W(s)|2) for the photospheric (panel a) and TR (panel c; Fig 4) emis-

sion from a location within the selected plage locations. We have not applied any smoothing before

the wavelet transform as it can add spurious periodicities in the TS (Auchère et al. 2016). We have

normalized the wavelet power as described in subsection 3.1. A major fraction of the photospheric

power is concentrated in periods shorter than 15 minutes (i.e., high frequency), however, signiﬁcant

power can also be found around 5 minutes and reﬂects the well know photospheric oscillations (see

panel; Fig. 4). In the TR we also see the dominant power in high periods (panel d; Figure 4). This

power is not spurious and is persistent over long timescale (i.e., such periods exist more than 25

minutes or even longer, cf., Fig 4). It indicates wave propagation from the photosphere into the

TR. The white hatched area represents the Cone-of-Inﬂuence (COI) on each wavelet power map

(cf.,Fig. 4) while the solid white line outlines the 95% conﬁdence levels.

The red or white noise spectrum is often used to calculate the conﬁdence levels as described by

Torrence & Compo (1998). However, it should be noted that red or white noise does not really cap-

ture the inherited noise within the TS, which can in turn mislead the estimation of the conﬁdence

levels (Auchère et al. 2016). Ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light curves tend to

exhibit an overall power-law behavior and the inbuilt red noise model is inappropriate to ﬁt the

and its corresponding normalized wavelet power, respectively. The power within the TR is distributed within
the period of 2-8 minutes. The white contours on each wavelet map (panel b & d) outlines the 95% global

spectrum (except if the power-law exponent is -2.0; private communication with De Pontieu). In

the present analysis, we have also found that the TS shows a power-law behavior with a broad

distribution the exponent values and speciﬁc value of the power-law exponent (i.e., -2) are rare.

Therefore, we can say that in-built red-noise model is not appropriate to estimate the conﬁdence

levels. Recently, Auchère et al. (2016) proposed a generic noise model for an EUV TS (using AIA

high-temperature ﬁlter observations) and have also shown that smoothing can add artiﬁcial period-

icities. After Auchère et al. (2016), Threlfall et al. (2017) have also adopted the same generic noise

model for EUV TS under diﬀerent physical conditions of solar atmosphere. Auchère et al. (2016)

proposed that the generic noise model is a linear combination of the power law, kappa function,

and white noise. It is shown that the coronal signals are well ﬁtted through this model. The present

work deals with the signal from the lower solar atmosphere (i.e., photosphere & TR), therefore,

the noise characteristics may be diﬀerent from the inherited noise in the coronal time-series. We

check this fact and found that signals used in this work are best represented by only by a power

law. Hence, we utilized only a power-law function and omitted the kappa function & white noise

contribution. We have ﬁtted a function σ(v) to each power spectrum which (i.e., σ(v)) is described

as follows

σ(v) = Avs + C

(2)

Although the contribution from constant (i.e., C – white noise) is low in most of the conditions

still it may play an important role for some cases. Therefore, we kept the constant term in our

model. We ﬁrst ﬁtted σ(v) of each photospheric and TR power spectrum. Two samples are shown

in the Figure 3 with various components. Each panel of Figure 3 shows the FFT power spectrum

(black histogram), time averaged wavelet spectrum (red line) and the ﬁtted generic noise model

(sigma(v); green line). Using this noise model, we estimate the local (blue line in both panels

of Fig 3) and global 95% Fourier conﬁdence level (pink line in both panels of Fig. 3). We also

estimated the global 95% conﬁdence levels which are shown by the gray solid line in both panels

of Fig. 3. It should be noted that the global 95% Fourier conﬁdence level has high values compared

to the local/global 95% wavelet conﬁdence level for all periods. The local/global 95% conﬁdence

levels lie below the power spectra (i.e, Fourier & time-averaged wavelet) for most of the period

bins. However, the global 95% wavelet conﬁdence levels are higher than the local 95% wavelet

conﬁdence level. It should be noted that a similar type of ﬁndings is reported in previous works

for coronal signals (Auchère et al. 2016; Threlfall et al. 2017). The estimated values of various

parameters (e.g., A, s, and χ2) are also provided in each ﬁgure. The low χ2 values justify the

reliability of the ﬁtting model. Panel a and c are dedicated for AIA 1700 while panel b and d are

for IRIS 1400 TS. Through the described methodology, we have estimated wavelet power maps for

AIA 1700 Å and IRIS 1400 Å and associated 95% conﬁdence levels (i.e., local & global wavelet,

global Fourier) in the plage region. Figure 4 shows the normalized wavelet power map with the

95% wavelet global conﬁdence level as white lines (panel b and d). It shows that power is inherited

over a broad range of periods within the photosphere and TR.

Fig. 6. Left: The normalized cross wavelet power between AIA 1700 Å and IRIS/SJI 1400 Å. The normalized
cross power is distributed in the similar period range as in the case of wavelet power of photosphere and TR
(cf., Fig. 4). Right: Wavelet coherence is displayed along with the over plotted phase diﬀerence angle (black
and purple arrows) within the high coherence regime (i.e., coherence above 0.6). Negative phase diﬀerence
(black arrows) represent downward propagating waves, while positive phase diﬀerence (purple arrows) in-
dicates upwardly propagating waves. It is clearly visible that below 7.0 minutes the waves are propagating
upward into the TR from the photosphere. The white contours outline the 95% conﬁdence levels while white
cross hatched area outlines the COI.

Further, the wavelet coherence analysis is performed using AIA 1700 Å and IRIS 1400 Å, which

is important to understand coherent and incoherent oscillations at two diﬀerent heights. In the

very ﬁrst step, the cross spectrum (cross wavelet power) of two TS (i.e., photospheric and TR)

is determined by multiplying the wavelet of one TS with the complex conjugate of the wavelet

of another TS. The cross-spectrum highlights the power areas in the time-frequency range, which

has common power in both TS. However, it should be noted that the cross spectrum does not

necessarily possess very high power as it is visible in the individual TS. The left-panel of Fig. 6

shows the normalized cross spectrum, which is drawn using the intensity TS of photosphere and

TR. We have utilized the cross FFT power and time-averaged cross wavelet power to estimate the

95% global conﬁdence levels for this cross wavelet power which is further normalized by noise

arrays (as described in subsection 3.1). We have adopted a similar methodology as we applied for

individual TS. Figure 5 shows two diﬀerent samples for estimation of the 95% local and global

conﬁdence levels. The white line outlines the normalized cross wavelet power, which is above

the 95% conﬁdence level. The normalized cross wavelet power shows that a signiﬁcant common

power lies in the very wide range of periods, which is a signature of possible relation between the

photosphere and TR. However, it should be noted that common cross power alone is not suﬃcient

in order to draw deﬁnite conclusions about wave propagation.

Therefore, we further study the wavelet coherence, which is an important parameter to investigate

the interaction between two TS. The cross wavelet power is normalized by the multiplication of

the power of both series, which is basically the wavelet coherence (Torrence & Compo (1998)).

The coherence can vary from zero to one. A value of zero value represents complete incoherence

and a value of one the perfect coherence between the two TS. The cross-spectrum of the TS is

necessary to ﬁnd out signiﬁcant common power in the time and frequency domains, however, the

wavelet coherence is also needed to ﬁnd the relationship between the two heights in the solar

atmosphere. Therefore, the wavelet coherence is an important parameter to signify the correlations

of oscillations between two heights. Right-panel of Figure 6 shows the corresponding coherence

map. Similar to normalized cross power map, coherence map also outlines 95% conﬁdence levels

by white lines. In addition, hatched white area outlines the COI area on cross power and coherence

maps.

Finally, we have estimated the phase lag (i.e., diﬀerence of phase angles at two diﬀerent heights) in

the time and period domains. The cross wavelet gives the complex array in the time-period domain,

which can be converted into the phase angle using real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers

(Bloomﬁeld et al. (2004); Jafarzadeh et al. (2017)). The phase angle reﬂects the phase lag between

the two intensity TS originating from two diﬀerent heights. We have put some speciﬁc conditions

to select the valid phase lags for the greater reliability of the results, e.g., (a) we have used only

those regions which have signiﬁcant cross power (i.e., cross power lies within the regime of 95%

global conﬁdence level), (b) the coherence value should be greater than 0.6 in these signiﬁcant

cross power areas, (c) we have excluded the COI area to avoid spurious edge eﬀects. Therefore, we

have extracted the valid phase lags using the above described conditions in the time-period domain.

We have used arrows to show these valid phase lags on the time-period domain. These valid phase

lags are over plotted on the coherence maps using white (positive phase lag) and black arrows

(negative phase lags). The positive phase lags indicate the upward propagation, while the negative

phase lags represent the downward propagation of the waves between two heights. The phase lag is

positive in the short period regime (i.e, less than 6.0 minutes), which shows the propagation of the

waves from photosphere to TR (right-panel; Fig. 6). However, negative phase lag is evident within

the regime of high period (i.e., beyond 8.0 minutes). This observational ﬁndings indicates that the

waves, within the period range of 2.0 to 6.0 minutes propagate upward from the photosphere and

can reach up to the TR.

We applied the same procedure to all the plage locations to extract valid phase lags. After extracting

the phase lags we produce the 2-D histogram (i.e., phase lag vs period) using all plage locations.

Panel (a) of Fig. 7 shows a 2-D histogram of phase lags. The histogram reveals the presence of

signiﬁcant phase lag within the period range from 2.0 to 9.0 minutes. Periods less than 7.0 minutes

are dominated by the positive phase angles while for periods longer than 7.0 minutes the phase

angles are distributed both in the positive and negative regimes. The over plotted blue contours

are ﬁtted 2-D Gaussian which successfully characterize the behavior of the observed phase lag

Fig. 7. (a) 2-D histogram of ∆ φ, extracted from all plage locations. The white contours show a ﬁtted 2-D
Gaussian on the 2-D ∆ φ histogram. The histogram reveals that shorter periods have positive phase diﬀerence
while longer periods move into the negative phase diﬀerence regime. With the help of a 2-D Gaussian, we
have estimated the peak phase diﬀerence for each period. (b) The distribution of phase diﬀerence at the period

distribution. With the help of 2-D Gaussian ﬁtting, we have estimated the peak phase angle at

every period. Panel (b) in Fig. 7 shows the distribution of phase angles at a period of 4.35 minutes.

At this period, the peak of the distribution lies around 43.56o with the 1-σ spread of 39.94o (see;

panel (b)). Finally, we have produced the behavior of mean phase lag with periods that is shown in

panel (c) of Fig. 7. The phase lag is decreasing with increasing period. It is clearly visible that zero

phase angle occurs around 9.0 minutes (cf, panel c as well as panel a), which predicts that waves

with periods less than 9.0 minutes successfully propagate from the photosphere into the TR.

3.3. Evidence of the Propagationof Magneto-acousticWaves

In this work we aim to investigate the propagation of waves within VMPL through phase diﬀer-

ence (∆φ). The phase diﬀerence between the photospheric (AIA 1700) and TR (IRIS/SJI 1400 Å)

reveals the presence of positive phase lag within the period-regime from 2.0 to 9.0 minutes (cf.,

Fig. 7). ∆φ is decreasing with the period. Such observational ﬁnding suggests that most of the pho-

tospheric power leaks into the TR through the wave propagation in this period regime. We have

P. Kayshap et al.: Propagation of Waves above a Plage as Observed by IRIS and SDO

performed some further investigations to understand the nature of these waves. Using ∆φ and the

corresponding frequency and height diﬀerence between two atmospheric layers, we can estimate

the wave travel time and propagation speed. For instance, the ∆φ is around 63.20o±34.90o at the

frequency of 5.4 mHz (or around 3.0 minutes; cf., Fig. 7).

,

(3)

Using Eq. 3 and upper value of ∆φ (i.e., µ+2.0σ), the wave travel time (τ) is around 68.34 s for the

frequency of 5.4 mHz. The Si iv 1393.77 Å spectral line typically forms at a geometrical height

of 2-3 Mm above the photosphere. Lets assume a height diﬀerence of 2 Mm (lower bound value)

between the photosphere (AIA 1700 Å) and TR (IRIS/SJI 1400 Å). So, the wave travel time and

distance (height diﬀerence between photosphere and TR) yields a wave propagation speed of ∼29

km s−1. It is believed that waves travel with slightly lower speed (i.e., 15-20 km/s) within the lower

solar atmosphere (B. De Pontieu; private communication) and our estimated propagation speed is

higher than expected. We have used VMPL (very bright and high-magnetic ﬁeld areas) that can

have signiﬁcantly higher temperatures compared to the quiet-Sun. We do not have the temperature

measurement in present baseline, although surely, qualitatively we can assume that plage should

have higher temperatures compared to the quiet-Sun. These higher temperature can lead to a higher

sound speed. So, we may infer that the speed of the propagating waves is close to the sound speed

within the plage region. Our observational ﬁndings indicate that these are slow magneto acoustic

waves (SMAW). De Pontieu et al. (2003, 2005) have also reported the propagation of SMAW into

the corona from the photosphere in plage regions. Nonlinear eﬀects contribute to complex wave dy-

namics (Heggland et al. 2011; Skogsrud et al. 2016) while the occurrence of shocks produce strong

gradients in various physical parameter (i.e., intensity or Doppler velocity) over a short period of

time (Tian et al. (2014)). Variations of the physical parameters (i.e., intensity or Doppler velocity)

should reveal the saw-tooth pattern as reported by Tian et al. (2014). Panel (b) of ﬁgure A.1 shows

the Si iv 1393.77 Å intensity images (y-t image).

A large number of samples (i.e., 5927 TS within the plage) are utilized in the present analysis.

We have found that a large number of locations show good correlation between the photosphere

and the TR over a signiﬁcant time interval. That is the reason we have used all the locations to

create the ﬁnal 2-D histogram (cf., Fig 7). Previous reports state that only a small fraction of the

locations show a nice correlation between two atmospheric layers. For example, De Pontieu et al.

(2003) have reported that only 4% locations (6 out of the total 148) show a good correlation that

indicate the successful propagation of the SMAW between the photosphere and TR. In the present

observation, we have found that almost all locations have correlation between photosphere and

TR. In previous work, with the help of FFT, Centeno et al. (2009) have utilized all the locations to

draw the phase diﬀerence diagram (frequency vs phase) between photosphere and chromosphere.

We have also used all the locations to draw the phase vs. frequency histogram. In this work, we

use IRIS high resolution observations and analysis techniques (wavelet, cross spectrum, coherence,

Article number, page 14 of 20

P. Kayshap et al.: Propagation of Waves above a Plage as Observed by IRIS and SDO

and a generic noise model), which lead these results with even more accuracy. Higher occurrence

of propagation of SMAW within the plage region are inferred from IRIS observations for ﬁrst

time. We believe that this is important for the energy transport and thereby possible heating of the

atmosphere overlying the plage region.

4. Discussion & Conclusions

Centeno et al. (2006, 2009) investigated wave propagation in diﬀerent features of the solar atmo-

sphere (e.g., umbra, pore and faculae) through ∆ φ using FFT. They reported a successful propa-

gation of 3-minute oscillations into the chromosphere for each of these solar features. In the case

of faculae, they found that low frequency waves (5 minute) can also reach the chromosphere. The

variation of cut-oﬀ frequency was also investigated using frequency vs ∆ φ diagrams (Centeno et al.

2006, 2009). Their ﬁndings suggest that waves with longer periods can also propagate into the TR

in a plage environment. Centeno et al. (2006, 2009) used only vertical magnetic ﬁeld and success-

fully managed to show the propagation of 5-minute oscillations in faculae. De Pontieu et al. (2004)

reported that the leakage of p-modes into the upper atmosphere is only possible along inclined mag-

netic ﬁelds while Centeno et al. (2009) reported the propagation of 5-minute waves in faculae for

non-inclined (almost vertical) magnetic ﬁeld. Heggland et al. (2011) used numerical simulations to

study wave propagation. Waves with a 5 minute period dominate in strong and inclined ﬂux-tubes

whereas 3 minutes dominates in weak or vertical magnetic ﬂux tubes. Similar to De Pontieu et al.

(2004), Heggland et al. (2011) have also found that ﬂux tube inclination is important for long-

period wave propagation. Further, De Pontieu et al. (2003, 2005) have reported that longer period

waves associated with the photospheric 5 minute oscillations can reach into the TR within the plage

region.

In the present work we have estimated 2-D Fourier power maps from plage observations (i.e.,

plage+surrounding area) at diﬀerent frequency ranges (i.e., high to low-frequencies). The Fourier

power maps show how the wave power is distributed in the plage & surrounding area and show

that most of the wave dynamics are inherited in the intermediate frequency range. We found very

low power at high frequencies without any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the plage and surrounding

region. Similarly, low frequencies do not show the diﬀerence between the plage and surrounding

region but have high power in comparison to the power inherited in the high frequency range.

Hence, on-average, the Fourier power behavior suggests that the dynamics of the plage region

is inherited within the regime of intermediate frequencies. Then, we applied for the ﬁrst time a

generic noise model to estimate the conﬁdence levels using wavelet analysis on photospheric and

TR TS. The noise model has been previously applied only for coronal TS (Auchère et al. 2016;

Threlfall et al. 2017). Previous scientiﬁc works have utilized either a white or red noise model to

calculate conﬁdence levels, which can give erroneous conﬁdence levels. In addition, Auchère et al.

(2016) have reported that smoothing can include spurious periods, therefore, we did not apply any

type of smoothing to our TS. The generic noise model and original TS have signiﬁcantly improved

Article number, page 15 of 20

the accuracy of the results. Our analysis has revealed that waves within a certain period range (i.e.,

2.0 to 9.0 minutes) are propagating into the TR from the solar photosphere. We have found that

∆ φ decreases with period, which qualitatively matches with the previous reported results (e.g.,

Centeno et al. 2006, 2009).

We have estimated the wave travel time and propagation speed using ∆ φ, frequency and height

diﬀerence (between photosphere and TR), e.g. 68.34 seconds wave travel time at a frequency of 5.4

mHz, which gives the propagation speed of about 29.26 km s−1. This propagation speed is close

to the sound speed in the TR, which justiﬁes our conclusion that these are SMAWs. In addition, a

signiﬁcant correlation/propagation (in terms of the locations) between the photosphere and TR is

revealed in the present analysis for the ﬁrst time using IRIS and AIA observations. Previous works

report very small fraction of a good correlation between photosphere and TR (De Pontieu et al.

2003). The occurrence frequency of correlation/propagation of SMAW is very high in the present

study. It should be noted that we have only used the almost vertical magnetic ﬁeld plage locations

and ﬁnd that a broad range of waves (i.e., 2 to 9 minutes) successfully reach into the TR from

photosphere. Finally, our results suggest that the propagation of 5 min oscillations may not depend

on the magnetic ﬁeld inclination, which supports the ﬁndings of Centeno et al. (2006, 2009). We

have investigated the nonlinear character of waves (i.e., shocks) and did not ﬁnd any such signature.

We investigated which emission (i.e., photospheric – continuum part of SJI 1400 Å ﬁlter or

Si iv lines in SJI 1400 Å) dominates in the SJI 1400 Å. On the basis of a light curve comparison

and phase analysis, we found that the SJI 1400 Å emission is dominated by the Si iv lines (see

appendix A for more details). Similarly, Skogsrud et al. (2016) have reported that bright grains

emission originates from the TR (i.e., Si iv lines rather than the photosphere (i.e., continuum part

of SJI 1400 ﬁlter). However, using the same observations, Martínez-Sykora et al. (2015) suggests

that the emission of bright grains originates from the photosphere.

Appendix A: Consistency between IRIS/SJI 1400 Å and Si iv 1393.77 Å

As we have derived well correlated oscillations in near photospheric (AIA 1700 Å) and TR (IRIS/SJI

1400 Å emission), we need to evaluate is the IRIS/SJI 1400 Å bandpass is indeed dominated by

the TR emission. The IRIS/SJI 1400 Å ﬁlter is a 55 Å broad ﬁlter, which contains two strong Si iv

lines. However, a large portion of this ﬁlter is dominated by the photospheric continuum. The Si iv

Fig. A.1. Panels (a) and (b) show the y-t intensity images from IRIS/SJI 1400 Å and Si iv 1393.77 Å. These
images are very similar. We have compared IRIS/SJI 1400 Å TS (black line) with Si iv 1393.77 Å (2 times
Si iv) from two diﬀerent locations (panels (c), and (d)) to understand the similarities/diﬀerences in the nature
of both TS. Panel (e) shows histograms of the correlation coeﬃcients for QS (black) and plage (red). The
plage histogram is sharply peaked towards high values.

1393.77 Å spectral line, which is the strong line within this ﬁlter, is also included in for this ob-

servation. With the help of this spectral line, we can check the dominance of emissions within this

ﬁlter.

First, we estimate the intensities from the Si iv 1393.77 Å line using Gaussian ﬁtting. By selecting

the slit position in SJ images, we have produced y (along the slit)-t(time) intensity images from

IRIS/SJI 1400 Å data cube. This allows for a comparison between the y-t intensity images of SJI

1400 Å and Si iv 1393.77 Å. The intensity image from SJI 1400 Å) is very similar to the intensity

image from Si iv 1393.77 Å (cf., panel a and b of Fig. A.1). We have also examined TS from two

diﬀerent locations within the plage (cf., panels c and d; Fig A.1). This shows that the SJI 1400 Å

emission exactly follows the TR emission (emissions from Si iv 1393.77 Å). Using intensity thresh-

old, we divide the regions into plage and surrounding quiet-Sun (QS). We then look for correlations

between the IRIS/SJI 1400 Å and Si iv 1393.77 Å TS for each location. Panel c of Fig. A.1 shows

the statistical distribution of correlation coeﬃcients for plage (red histogram) and QS (black his-

Fig. A.2. Panel (a) shows a 2-D histogram of phase diﬀerences which is distributed within ± 20. panel (b)
shows the distribution of phase diﬀerence (black line), which are estimated using IRIS/SJI 1400 Å and Si iv

togram). The histograms reveal that the QS coeﬃcients show a very large spread while the plage

histogram is sharply peaked at a high value (around 0.7). It is also evident that the mean coeﬃcient

is high for plage region (0.75) compared to QS (0.6). These observational ﬁndings support that SJI

1400 Å and Si iv 1393.77 Å are highly correlated with each other in the plage regions.

In the further step, we have investigated the phase diﬀerence between IRIS/SJI 1400 Å and Si iv

1393.77 Å. The Si iv 1393.77 Å line forms in the TR. If IRIS/SJI 1400 Å is dominated by the emis-

sion originating from the TR, then the phase lag between SJI 1400 Å and Si iv 1393.77 Å should be

around zero phase. Applying the same methodology (as previously described), we have estimated

the phase lag between SJI 1400 Å and Si iv 1393.77 Å and this is shown in Fig. A.2. The 2-D

histogram (a) shows that almost all phase angles are accumulated within ±15 at each period. In ad-

dition, the phase lags have no dependency on the periods as it should be expected theoretically and

we found previously. In (b) we also show the statistical distribution of the estimated phase diﬀer-

ences. The black line is a histogram of phase lags, while the over plotted blue line is the Gaussian

ﬁt of the histogram. The distribution shows that the peak lies around zero phase diﬀerence (i.e.,

-1.16). Moreover, the Gaussian ﬁtting shows that the Full Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) is

around 20. On the basis of these observational ﬁndings, we can say that IRIS/SJI 1400 Å captures

the emissions from TR within the plage areas.
