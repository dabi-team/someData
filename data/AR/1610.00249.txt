The (001) surface of SrTiO3 were transformed from insulating to conducting after

Ar+ irradiation, producing a quasi two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). This con-

ducting surface layer can introduce Rashba spin orbital coupling due to the broken

inversion symmetry normal to the plane. The spin splitting of such a surface has re-

cently been demonstrated by magneto-resistance and angular resolved photoemission

spectra measurements. Here we present experiments evidencing a large spin-charge

conversion at the surface. We use spin pumping to inject a spin current from NiFe

ﬁlm into the surface, and measure the resulting charge current. The results indicate

that the Rashba eﬀect at the surface can be used for eﬃcient charge-spin conversion,

and the large eﬃciency is due to the multi-d-orbitals and surface corrugation.

It

holds great promise in oxide spintronics.

It was pointed out by Dresselhaus1 and Rashba2, in non-centrosymmetric zinc-blende or

wurtzite semiconductors that the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) becomes odd in the electron
momentum ~p. The SO Hamiltonian can be written as HSO ∼ µB( ~E × ~p) · ~σ/mc2, where
~E, ~p, m, c, ~σ and µB are the electric ﬁeld, electron momentum, electron mass, light speed,

Pauli matrices and Bohr magneton, respectively. As a consequence of this odd-in-p SO
coupling, electrons moving in an electric ﬁeld experience an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld ~Bef f ∼
~E × ~p/mc2, which is coupled with the spin of electrons. Due to the SO coupling, unpolarized

charge currents can be converted into transverse pure spin currents, in a phenomenon called

spin Hall eﬀect (SHE). Later on, it was pointed out by Bychkov and Rashba3 in 1984 that if

a crystal has a single high-symmetry axis and an invariant vector ~z oriented along this axis,

similar SOC can be obtained. This is the so-called Rashba SOC (RSOC) with its associated
electronic Hamiltonian written as HRSOC = αR(~σ × ~k) · ~z, where ~k is the wave vector of the

traveling electrons, and αR is the so-called Rashba coupling constant. According to this,

electrons moving in materials experience a wave vector dependent eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld
with magnitude BR = 2αRkF /gµB and its direction being dependent on ~k and ~z, where kF
is the wave vector at the Fermi level, g is the electron Land´e g-factor and µB = 9.27 ×10−24J
T−1 is the Bohr magneton. Over the past 30 years, the RSOC has inspired a vast number of

predictions, discoveries and innovative concepts. The Rashba physics in condensed matter

was recently reviewed by Manchon et al4. It was ﬁrstly experimentally demonstrated by

Sih et al.5 in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) conﬁned in (110) AlGaAs quantum

wells using Kerr rotation microscopy. The Rashba coupling constant was determined to be
αR = 1.8 × 10−12eV m according to the spin-splitting energy. One great beneﬁt from using

2DEG lies in that the RSOC can be nicely tuned by electric ﬁelds as predicted by Shanavas

et al.6, and demonstrated by experiments7,8. The asymmetric 2D electron system can be

realized in ultra-thin metallic layers and surfaces. The current-induced spin polarization on

free metal surfaces has also been systematically studied on the surfaces of Au, Cu, Pt, Pd,

Ta and W by spin-polarization positron beam9. Besides these surfaces, metallic interfaces

can also possess this asymmetry as shown in Pt/Co(0.6 nm)/AlOx
with αR = 10−10eV m.

Following the Rashba Hamiltonian, an associated anomalous charge current ~jc = −e[~r, HRSOC]/i~ =

−eαR(~z × ~σ)/~ arises from the non-equilibrium spin density ~σ. This spin galvanic eﬀect is
also called the Inverse Rashba Edelstein eﬀect (IREE)11. Recently, experimental evidences

2

for a large spin-charge conversion at the Bi/Ag12,13, Ag/Sb14 and LaAlO3/SrTiO3

15 inter-

faces were found by the use of microwave spin pumping to inject spin currents from the

NiFe layer into the heterointerface.

The 2DEG can be also formed at the surfaces of transitional metal oxides16–18, which ex-

hibits extraordinary properties such as tunable insulator-metal transitions19, large anisotropic

magnetoresistance20, etc.. Due to the asymmetric geometry, the Rashba SO coupling is an-

ticipated. Evidence of the Rashba spin splitting in the quasi 2DEG formed at the (001)

surface of SrTiO3 (STO) single crystal was found from weak localization or antilocalization

analysis of the low-temperature magnetoresistance7. The spin splitting energy is 0.1-0.3

meV. Later on, a giant spin splitting of about 100 meV at the Fermi level in the two-

dimensional electron gas formed at the surface of STO was observed at 20 K, which goes
beyond the expectation of the normal Rashba eﬀect: Considering the band bending ∼ 300
meV amounts to an electric ﬁeld ∼ 100MV m−1, which will give a spin splitting of only
about 10−5 meV. The surface corrugations may result in a greatly enhanced Rashba pa-
rameter that increases the spin splitting21. As experiments clearly show the presence of SO

coupling and spin splitting in the 2DEG on STO surfaces, the IREE can also be anticipated.

This is the main result of this work, where a clear evidence of the voltages induced by the

non-equilibrium spins pumped from NiFe ﬁlms into the conducting STO surfaces after Ar+

irradiation was observed at room temperature. It shows that the spin-to-charge conversion

can be comparable with that of the Bi/Ag bilayer. The results support a large Rashba

coupling constant in this 2DEG, which holds great potential to explore spintronic physics

in such treated oxide surfaces.

The substrate used in this study is the polished single-crystal STO (001) with dimensions
of 10 mm × 5 mm × 0.2 mm, which is mounted in a vacuum chamber and bombarded with
Ar+ generated by a home made Hall ion source. The implantation dose is about 1.2×1022
cm−2. Subsequently, a 20-nm-thick ferromagnetic NiFe layer was magnetron sputtered on

the non-treated and ion-irradiated STO substrate with the argon pressure at 0.5 Pa and the

RF power at 100 W.

The microwave measurement was done by our shorted microstrip ﬁxture which can work

up to 8 GHz at the room temperature. In order to put the samples at the same positions

in the ﬁxture and minimize the diﬀerences of the experienced microwave ﬁeld before and

after sample ﬂipping, we covered the samples with virgin STO of the same dimensions as

the substrate. We obtained the voltage by lock-in techniques (SR830, Standford Research

System) with microwave source power provided by Rohde & Schwarz (SMB 100A). At the

ﬁxed microwave frequency, we sweep the static magnetic ﬁeld so that FMR was observed.

To determine the thickness of the conductive layer, a wedge cross-section etched from a

photoresist patterned sample by a Ar+ ion beam of 5 keV for 30 seconds (PIPS, Gatan Inc.).

The tilt angle between the Ar+ ion beam and the sample surface was set to be as low as

possible, around 6 degrees. Current AFM was measured at room temperature by an atomic

force microscope (AFM I, Attocube) equipped with a low noise current ampliﬁer (SR570,

Stanford Research System). During the CAFM measurement, a dc bias of 2 V was applied

to the sample, while the conductive diamond coated probe (CDT-CONTR, Nanosenors) was

virtually grounded.

The temperature dependent transport properties were measured in the Hall bar conﬁg-

uration. The current source is provided by Keithley 6221A and the voltage is measured by

Keithley 2182A, while the temperature is controlled by Lakeshore 335.

It is well demonstrated that the surface of insulating STO transforms into metallic after

proper Ar+ irradiation. It is due to the formation of oxygen vacancies after that16,20. At

the same time, the transparency is also decreased.

The conducting layer is estimated from the conductive AFM (CAFM) measurement of the

wedge cross-section of STO as schematically shown in Fig.1. (a). From the simultaneously

obtained topography and current images and the averaged proﬁles (Fig.1 (b)-(e)), it is found

that the thickness of conductive layer is within 5 nm below the STO surface. As the trace

distance of CAFM probe on the wedge cross-section was much larger than the thickness of

the conductive layer, the limit of the spatial current resolution of CAFM, typically around

5 nm, was overcame. Our results suggest that a conducting layer is formed on the STO

surface by Ar+ bombardment. The conductivity is exponentially dependent on the depth.

It is in agreement of depth dependence of oxygen concentration after irradiation.18

As shown in Fig. 2, the sheet resistance increases as the temperature increases, which

is evident of metallic behavior. The data can be ﬁtted to T n with n ∼ 2.7. The sheet
resistance (Rs) reaches ∼600 Ω/(cid:3) at room temperature. The electron Hall mobility reaches
∼ 160 cm2V−1s−1 at 77 K. Up to the room temperature, the temperature dependent electron
mobility can be best ﬁtted to T m with m ∼ −2.8. The behavior deviates from the phonon
dominant scattering of non-degenerated 2DEG, which gives m = −1 ∼ −1.522. Yet, the

origin of the surface 2DEGs on STO remains unclear, or even controversial16,23,24.

The spin transport properties were determined by the ﬂip-chip method using a shorted

micro-strip ﬁxture which was recently proposed by us25 as shown schematically in Fig.3(a)

and (b). The photon voltage is usually a superposition of the spin rectiﬁcation eﬀect(SRE)

in NiFe, which comes from the rectiﬁcation of the dynamic current and the oscillating

magneto-resistance driven by a dynamic magnetic ﬁeld, and the IREE in the metallic surface

of STO. According to Rashba spin orbital Hamiltonian the spin current can be written as
~jc = −eαR(~z ×~σ)/~. We can see that ~jc is an odd function of the surface normal ~z, while the

spin rectiﬁcation eﬀect (SRE) is independent of it. Thus, IREE and SRE may be separated

by comparing their combined voltages after inverting the samples in the z plane. Speciﬁcally,
the voltage due to the IREE is VIREE = (Vup − Vdn)/2 and VSRE = (Vup + Vdn)/2, where the

Vup,dn are the photon voltages measured before and after the sample is ﬂipped as shown in

Fig.3(a) and (b). The voltage measured at 4.2 GHz is shown in Fig.3(c). The respective

contributions of SRE and IREE voltages are quite obvious in the ﬁgure as indicated by the

diﬀerence of the two curves before and after chip ﬂipping. As can be seen from the ﬁgure,

FIG. 3. Measurement of the IREE voltages. The measurements were done in two steps as schemat-

ically shown in (a) and (b). The corresponding measured photon voltages before (up) and after

(dn) sample ﬂipping as the function of the magnetic ﬁeld H are shown in (c) . The voltages of

SRE and IREE obtained from the curves (c) are shown in (d) .

the SRE voltage is a combination of the static magnetic ﬁeld H-dependent symmetric and
antisymmetric Lorentzian curves VSRE = VL · L(H) + VD · D(H), with

(2)

where Hr and ∆H are the ferromagnetic resonant ﬁeld and linewidth at ferromagnetic

resonance (FMR), respectively. Clearly seen from the curve in Fig.3 (d), there is symmetric

Lorentzian component from IREE. The IREE voltage is of the same order of magnitude as

SRE.

We also measured the voltages when the magnetic ﬁeld is reversed from y (0◦) axis to −y
axis (180◦). The IREE voltages are shown in Fig.4(a) as a function of the static magnetic

ﬁeld. The reversal of the magnetic ﬁeld causes the reversal of the spin polarization ~σ,

thus changes the voltage to switch signs from positive to negative, in agreement with the

theoretical prediction of spin current conversion to the charge current.

The power dependent voltage of IREE is shown in Fig.4(b). Because the VIREE is

proportional to the spin current js, which is in turn proportional to the square of the

∝ P , this leads to the linear dependence of the VIREE on the

microwave power. This linear dependence of the photon voltage and microwave power is

shown in the inset of Fig.4(b).

The trajectories of the resonant peaks, i.e. the resonant frequency (fr) vs. the resonant

ﬁeld (Hr), from symmetric Lorentzian lines of IREE and SRE are basically the same, which

reﬂect the FMR condition in Py ﬁlms. They are ﬁtted to the Kittel’s formula

fr =

γ
2π

p(Hr + Hk)(Hr + Hk + 4πMs),

(3)

where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. With the eﬀective saturation magnetization 4πMs ∼ 11
kOe and magnetocrystalline anisotropic constant Hk ∼ 0.84 Oe, the data can be nicely

ﬁtted as shown by the red line in the ﬁgure. The amplitude VL and VD of SRE changes

with the frequency, because of the variation of the phase between the dynamic current j

and magnetic ﬁeld26. This frequency dependent amplitude mixing of VL and VD prevents

us from simply taking the symmetric component of the voltage as contribution from IREE,

while the asymmetric one from the SRE.

The IREE is the process of conversion of spin current js to the charge current jc via

RSOC. Its eﬃciency can be measured. The coeﬃcient λIREE connects the two quantity12:

jc = λIREEjs

(4)

The spin current js pumped from NiFe at FMR can be obtained by measuring the spin

mixing conductance Gmix, which is related to the increase of the NiFe damping due to spin

pumping. The linewidth (∆H) from the virgin and irradiated STO substrate are shown

in Fig. 5, which clearly show an increase when spin pumping is present in the conducting

STO/NiFe bilayer. They can be linearly ﬁtted by ∆H = ∆H0 + 4παf /γ. The two lines give

α0 = 0.01025 and αef f = 0.01292 for the virgin and irradiated substrate, respectively. The

zero-freqency linewidth ∆H0 comes from inhomogeneous broadening due to imperfections in
the ﬁlms27. Extrapolation of both lines to f = 0 GHz gives ∆H0 ∼ 3 Oe. The similar ∆H0

obtained for both samples indicates that the ﬁlms grown on both substrates are of the same

crystalline quality. The increased line width for the irradiated STO/NiFe sample, which is

proportional to the frequency comes from the spin pumping, which is characterized by the

spin mixing conductivity,

Gmix =

where Ms, tF and µB are the eﬀective saturation magnetization, the thickness of the ferro-

magnetic layer, and the Bohr magneton, respectively. The damping constants αef f (,0) are

the values taken from Py on irradiated and virgin STO, respectively. With the data obtained
from the above, the spin mixing conductivity is 2.98 × 1019 m−2, which is comparable with
that of Py/GaAs28, e.g. 2.31 × 1019m−2.

The calculated value of js is 10.8 kA m−2 in our sample at f = 4.8 GHz, ω = 2πf and

hrf = 0.13 Oe. The spin current is absorbed in the conduction surface of STO and produces

nonequilibrium spin density. By the IREE, it is converted to the charge current density jc

ﬂowing through the 2D conducting layer, which can be estimated by

where Rs and l are the sheet resistance of the sample and distance between the electrodes,
respectively. Taking the experimental values of these parameters, we obtained λIREE ∼ 0.23

nm. This length is in the same order as λIREE = 0.33 nm in Ag/Bi interfaces reported by

S´anchez et al.12 .

As reported by Santander-Syro et al21, the spin splitting of 2DEG in STO is very large,
reaching more than 100 meV. This gives a Rashba coeﬃcient of αR ∼ 10−12 eV m. As in
the limit of strong spin-moment coupling, the λIREE ∼ αRτs/~, where τs is the eﬀective

relaxation time describing the ratio between spin injection and spin-moment scattering.

Taking our λIREE = 0.23 nm, we get τs = 0.15 ps, which is reasonable when considering the
rough surface of STO after Ar+ irradiation. In terms of level broadening, one obtains ~/τs =
4.4 meV, which is only a percentage of spin splitting on the corrugated STO surfaces21. The

results obtained so far supported the huge Rashba splitting picture of STO surfaces, where

multiorbital, especially the d-orbital Rashba physics and surface atomic conﬁguration are

both critical7.

In summary, we have measured the electric voltage on the metallic conducting (001)

surface of SrTiO3, converted from the spin current which is pumped from the NiFe layer by

microwave excitation at ferromagnetic resonance. The conversion eﬃciency is on the same

order as the interfaces in metallic multilayers. The spin-orbital coupling constant obtained

from our measurements support the giant spin splitting picture from ARPES measurements.

This extends the range of potential materials for spin-current detector without magnetic

materials.

In addition, the 2DEG allows the spin orbital coupling to be presented in a

controllable way.
