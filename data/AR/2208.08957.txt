ABSTRACT

The relationship between solar eruption and sunspot rotation has been widely reported, and the
underlying mechanism requires to be studied. Here we performed a full 3D MHD simulation of data-
constrained approach to study the mechanism of ﬂare eruptions in active region (AR) NOAA 10930,
which is characterized by continuous sunspot rotation and homologous eruptions. We reconstructed
the potential magnetic ﬁeld from the magnetogram of Hinode/SOT as the initial condition and drove
the MHD system by applying continuous sunspot rotation at the bottom boundary. The key magnetic
structure before the major eruptions and the pre-formed current sheet were derived, which is responsible
for the complex MHD evolution with multiple stages. The major eruptions were triggered directly by
fast reconnection in the pre-formed current sheet above the main polarity inversion line between the
two major magnetic polarities of the AR. Furthermore, our simulation shows the homologous eruption
successfully. It has reasonable consistence with observations in relative strength, energy release, X-
ray and Hα features and time interval of eruptions. In addition, the rotation angle of the sunspot
before the ﬁrst eruption in the simulation is also close to the observed value. Our simulation oﬀers
a scenario diﬀerent from many previous studies based on ideal instabilities of twisted magnetic ﬂux
rope, and shows the importance of sunspot rotation and magnetic reconnection in eﬃciently producing
homologous eruptions by continuous energy injection and impulsive energy release in a recurrent way.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar eruption is considered as the most magniﬁcent
phenomenon in the solar system.
It is manifested as
ﬂares and coronal mass ejections along with high en-
ergetic particle events, and these solar transients from
solar corona can aﬀect heavily the solar-terrestrial envi-
ronment. By estimating the typical parameters of the
eruptive source regions, it has been well recognized that
only the magnetic free energy stored in the coronal cur-
rent exceeds the required energy density as released in a
typical eruption (Forbes 2000). Based on this, many
theories of solar eruption have been proposed, which
converged into the standard CSHKP model (Carmichael
1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman
1976) by grasping the key structure of magnetic ﬁeld
and can be applied to incorporate many observations

(such as ﬂare, particle acceleration, shock wave and ra-
dio burst).

Although the basic scenario is well established, the
initiation mechanism of solar eruption remains not fully
understood. Currently two kinds of initiation mecha-
nisms are frequently invoked, one is based on the ideal
plasma macro-instabilities and the other on non-ideal,
micro process, i.e., magnetic reconnection (Chen 2011).
The coronal magnetic ﬁeld in the non-eruptive evolution
is nearly force-free, and a particular force-free structure,
magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR), holds the central position
in models based on ideal instabilities.
In the earliest
model of such kind, the MFR is simply taken as an elec-
tric wire as in Lin & Forbes (2000) (later an MFR has a
twisted 3D structure), which is conﬁned to be in equilib-
rium by the overlying magnetic arcade that is anchored
at the photosphere. The ideal instabilities of such a

Wang et al.

pre-existing MFR, mainly the torus and kink instabil-
ity, provide an eﬀective way for driving eruptions as de-
veloped by many theoretical and simulation researches
(Bateman 1978; T¨or¨ok et al. 2004; Fan 2005; Kliem &
T¨or¨ok 2006). When the MFR reaches the critical point
of instability, the eruption is triggered with a quick lift-
ing up of the MFR. Meanwhile a current sheet (CS)
forms under the erupting MFR in a dynamic way. A
ﬂare is resulted when magnetic reconnection sets in at
the CS, which converts magnetic energy to thermal and
nonthermal energies that power the ﬂare. Usually the
torus instability is considered to be more eﬃcient, while
the kink one can only bring MFRs to be torus unsta-
ble or, otherwise, conﬁned ﬂares (T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005;
Schmieder et al. 2013).

The second type of mechanisms as built upon mag-
netic reconnection needs a CS forms before eruption,
such as the bipolar tether-cutting model (Moore &
Labonte 1980; Moore & Roumeliotis 1992; Moore et al.
2001) and the quadrupolar breakout model (Antiochos
et al. 1999; Karpen et al. 2012). In these models, the CS
ﬁrst forms, and reconnection then triggers the eruption,
while MFR forms during the eruption, which is distinct
from the ﬁrst type in which the CS is built up at the
wake of the erupting MFR. In the breakout model, a
magnetic null point needs to be pre-existing above a
sheared core. The expansion of the sheared core will
compress the null point to form the breakout CS. Slow
reconnection in the CS progressively weakens the overly-
ing ﬁeld, which in turn allows more expansion of the core
ﬁeld, and it is proposed that a positive feedback is estab-
lished, which ﬁnally leads to the formation of the ﬂare
CS (i.e., the vertical CS within the sheared core) and an
eruption (Karpen et al. 2012). The tether-cutting model
is simpler in the requirement of magnetic topology, since
it is based on only a bipolar arcade. Shearing motion
in bipolar ﬁeld near the polarity inversion line (PIL)
forms a CS. The reconnection in the CS cuts gradually
the tethering ﬁeld lines, which allows the expansion of
the core ﬁeld until a global disruption of the system is
triggered, similar to that of the breakout model. The
reconnection in a newly-formed large-scale CS, as re-
sulted from stretching of the large-scale overlying ﬁeld
by the rising core ﬁeld (as an MFR), further plays an
important role in supporting the eruption. However,
previous numerical simulations (e.g., Amari et al. 2003;
Aulanier et al. 2010) show that shearing motion alone
can only help to form an MFR (along with ﬂux can-
cellation), while its eruption is triggered by some ideal
instabilities. Recently a ultra-high accuracy MHD simu-
lation has established a new point: the sling-shot eﬀect
of reconnection can accelerate impulsively the plasma

to fast eruption without ideal instabilities taking place
(Jiang et al. 2021b), thus emphasizing the key role of
reconnection in both triggering and driving a eruption.
In the above models, magnetic energy ought to be re-
leased mainly by fast reconnection (Petschek 1964) even
in the presence of an erupting MFR. Ideal instabilities
alone can only release a small amount of magnetic en-
ergy (Forbes & Isenberg 1991), which is inadequate for
accelerating the coronal plasma.

Even though so many theoretical models exist, it is
not easy to determine which one operates in the realistic
events, since the coronal magnetic ﬁelds and their evo-
lutions associated with eruptions are often much more
complex than as described in the models. In the recent
years, numerical models that are constrained or directly
driven by the observed data have been developed and
proved to be a powerful tool in probing the mechanisms
of realistic solar eruptions (e.g., Inoue et al. 2014; Prasad
et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2018; Jiang & Hu 2018; Guo et al.
2021), and the progresses have been reviewed by Jiang
et al. (2022a).

In this paper we performed an MHD simulation of a
data-constrained approach to study the mechanism of
the ﬂare eruptions in active region (AR) NOAA 10930.
This AR is very eruption-productive and has been stud-
ied extensively in many previous papers (e.g., Su et al.
2007; Jing et al. 2008; Inoue et al. 2010; Ravindra et al.
2011; Fan 2011; Amari et al. 2014). It appeared on the
solar disk on December 2006 and produced a number of
ﬂares including four X-class ones in a few days (e.g., an
X3.4 ﬂare on December 13th and an X1.9 ﬂare on De-
cember 14th). The most prominent dynamics of the AR
is that a sunspot newly emerging into the AR showed
continual rotation for days in the period with the ﬂares.
For example, previous studies found that the sunspot
had rotated about 240◦ in 2 days (Zhang et al. 2007) or
540◦ in 5 days (Min & Chae 2009) as measured by diﬀer-
ent methods. Such rotation resulted in a strong shearing
ﬂow near the main PIL of the AR and the magnitude
of the shearing speed has also been estimated (Mag-
ara & Tsuneta 2008; Tan et al. 2009). There are some
static modeling of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld for this AR
(Schrijver et al. 2008; Guo et al. 2008), i.e., by using
nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation, veri-
fying that the magnetic structure has a highly sheared
core or MFR. A few works have been done also using
dynamic MHD simulations with focus on the mecha-
nism of eruptions, but the conclusions are at odds with
each other. For instance, based on the observed vector
magnetograms from Hinode/SOT (Tsuneta et al. 2008),
Amari et al. (2014) ﬁrst reconstructed a series of NLFFF
solutions to follow the pre-ﬂare evolution of the AR from

Simulation of AR 10930 eruption

December 9th to December 12th, and found that a sig-
moidal MFR was progressively built up. Then with the
pre-ﬂare NLFFF solutions as the initial condition, they
managed to simulate the eruption of the X3.4 ﬂare by
using 3 diﬀerent types of ad-hoc boundary conditions at
the bottom surface and concluded that the main trigger
of the ﬂare is torus instability of the MFR. Fan (2011)
constructed a background potential ﬁeld by the line-of-
sight magnetogram from SOHO/MDI for this AR and
then introduced into the core ﬁeld an artiﬁcial MFR
through rigid emergence from the bottom boundary to
simulate how the emerging MFR leads to the eruption
in the background ﬁeld. In such a study, they suggested
a diﬀerent trigger, i.e., kink instability rather than the
torus instability because the decay index near the erupt-
ing MFR is found to be smaller than the critical value
(n < 1.5). Another study (Muhamad et al. 2017) was
performed by triggering the eruption with a small bipole
emerging at the main PIL in a large-scale stable NLFFF
ﬁeld. By adjusting the orientations of the small bipole
relative to the main PIL, they concluded that the so-
called opposite polarity and reversed shear types’ emer-
gence can eﬀectively trigger the eruption, as the same
mechanism originally developed in Kusano et al. (2012).
We note that none of the aforementioned dynamic
simulations have taken into consideration the eﬀect the
continual and signiﬁcant rotation of the AR’s sunspot
in leading to the eruptions, which, however, is strongly
suggested by observations (Evershed 1909; Brown et al.
2003; Yan et al. 2008, 2018; Vemareddy et al. 2012).
Although the preﬂare sheared magnetic structure is un-
doubtedly resulted by the sunspot rotation, there is no
self-consistent model of such a process, and this is also
the motivation of this paper. Here we employed an MHD
model as driven by the sunspot rotation to follow the
coronal magnetic evolution of AR 10930 from its en-
ergy slow accumulation to fast releasing process. We
started the simulation with a potential magnetic ﬁeld re-
constructed from the observed magnetogram and then
applied a rotational motion to the positive sunspot of
the AR to mimic the observed rotation. With a contin-
ual rotational driving, our model displayed a full evolu-
tion from the initial potential ﬁeld to two homologous
eruptions (which may correspond to 2 X-class ﬂares).
We found that reconnection in a quasi-statically pre-
formed CS triggered the homologous eruptions, which is
consistent with a fundamental mechanism of solar erup-
tion initiation as recently established (Jiang et al. 2021b;
Bian et al. 2021, 2022a). Furthermore, our results of the
coronal magnetic conﬁguration have reasonable consis-
tency with the observed soft X-ray and Hα features.
Also the time interval and relative strength of the sim-

ulated eruptions are on the same scale of the quantities
of eruptions as derived from observations. The mecha-
nism in our research is diﬀerent from other works that
requires the pre-formed MFR and is initiated by ideal
MHD instabilities. We also suggest that many homolo-
gous eruptions of rotational sunspots may be triggered
by the same mechanism in this paper.

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst show the
observation and data in Section 2, then describe the
model and method in Section 3. Simulation results are
displayed in Section 4 and ﬁnally we give discussion and
conclusion in Section 5.

2. DATA AND OBSERVATION

The AR NOAA 10930 is highly dynamic in which 4
X−class ﬂares were produced and 3 of them occurred
on December, 2006; X6.5 on December 6th, X3.4 on
December 13th and X1.5 on December 14th (Kubo et al.
2007). In this research we focus on the X3.4 ﬂare located
at S07W22 on December 13th and the X1.5 ﬂare located
at S06W46 on December 14th (Bamba et al. 2013).

Figure 1 taken from Stoke V images of HINODE/SOT
(Kosugi et al. 2007; Tsuneta et al. 2008) shows the com-
plex magnetic ﬂux distribution of this AR. As denoted
in the 4th panel of the ﬁgure, we deﬁne 4 areas of the
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld, which are, respectively, the
strong positive (SP, which is the rotating sunspot), the
weak positive (WP, the weak ﬁeld region with positive
polarities at the west side of the rotating sunspot), the
strong negative (SN, i.e., the large sunspot) and the
weak negative (WN, the weak ﬁeld region of negative
polarity at the west side of the large sunspot). There are
mainly two sunspots with opposite magnetic polarities.
The leading sunspot (SN) shows nearly no change during
two ﬂare events, while the smaller one in the south (SP)
shows evident growth, and this indicates that the main
sunspots are not a pair. The positive sunspot emerged
later than the main negative sunspot, translating from
west to east (right to left) (Wang et al. 2008) with an
obvious counter-clockwise rotation from December 10th
to December 14th. It is connected not only to the main
negative sunspot in the north but also to the west (right)
dispersed polarities (WN) (Min & Chae 2009). The pos-
itive sunspot became diﬀused and rotated more slowly
on December 14th.

The evolution of an inverse-S sigmoid during two ﬂares
is shown in Figure 2 taken from Hinode/XRT (DeLuca
et al. 2005; Golub et al. 2007). The sigmoid formed near
the main PIL and had a big tail around December 12th,
which is likely formed by the rotation of the positive
sunspot. The post-ﬂare arcades spread from left to right
during the ﬁrst ﬂare. In the middle of December 13th,

4

Wang et al.

the ﬁrst ﬂare ended, and the sigmoid reformed at the
same position was involved in the second ﬂare. The post-
ﬂare arcades during the second eruption didn’t spread
too much to the right as the ﬂare ribbons. Both ﬂares
exhibited two ribbons signature as shown in the 1st and
3rd columns of Figure 3, which are taken from Broad-
band Filter Imager (BFI) of SOT. The negative ribbon
of both ﬂares was located between the two main spots,
spreading to right and was longer in the ﬁrst eruption.
While the positive ribbon was initially on the left side of
the positive polarity (since the footpoints at the positive
polarity have been rotated counter-clockwise to left) and
it shrank into a circle to the right (Figure 3). Except the
length of the negative ribbon, the corresponding ribbons
in both events resemble each other in both position and
shape, which reﬂects the similarity in their underlying
magnetic conﬁgurations and thus their trigger mecha-
nisms. There was an Earth−directed CME with a pro-
jected speed of 1780 km s−1 (Ravindra & Howard 2010)
on December 13th and another CME with a speed of
1042 km s−1 on December 14th. A major geomagnetic
storm was observed on December 15th.

3. MODEL AND METHOD

We used the DARE–MHD model (Jiang et al. 2016a)
to study the dynamic evolution of the solar corona.
The model was developed based on the CESE method
(Zhang et al. 2002; Chang & Tot 1993) in Cartesian
coordinate system combined with adaptive mesh reﬁne-
ment (AMR) technique by utilizing the PARAMESH
(MacNeice et al. 2000) to solve the full MHD equations:

ρ Dv

∂ρ
∂t + ∇ · (ρv) = −νρ (ρ − ρ0)
Dt = −∇p + J × B + ρg + ∇ · (νρ∇v)
∂B
∂t = ∇ × (v × B − ηµ0J)
∂T
∂t + ∇ · (T v) = (2 − γ)T ∇ · v

(1)

where J = ∇ × B/µ0, g is the solar gravity, µ0 is the
magnetic permeability in vacuum, ν is the kinetic vis-
cosity and γ = 1 is the adiabatic index. We choose
νρ = 0.05 VA (the Alfv´en speed) to avoid the very low
density in the strong magnetic ﬁeld region, which may
lead to a very small time step. By setting this, the
plasma density will be relaxed to its initial value ρ0 in
a time scale of 20 Alfv´en time τA. This time scale is
suﬃcient large such that the fast dynamics of Alfv´enic
speed is not inﬂuenced. The viscosity ν is given as
ν = 0.05∆x2/∆t, where ∆x (varies from 1(cid:48)(cid:48) to 4(cid:48)(cid:48) in our
simulation) and ∆t are the grid resolution and time step
respectively. No explicit resistivity was applied in our
simulation. Since to mimic the real corona environment,
any explicit value of η will give a larger value of resistiv-
ity than only a numerical method has, which will aﬀect

the reconnection process. The computational domain is
suﬃciently large of [−553, 553] Mm in x,y-direction and
[0, 1106] Mm in z-direction to prevent the inﬂuence of
the side and top boundary conditions on the computa-
tion of the eruption initiation. The Powell source terms
and the diﬀusion control term are added to maintain the
divergence-free condition of magnetic ﬁeld as described
in Jiang et al. (2010).

3.1. Initial Conditions

We smoothed the magnetogram at December 12th
2006, 20:30 UT which is taken from Schrijver et al.
(2008) using Gaussian smoothing with FWHM of 20
pixels. This makes the maximum value of Bz decreases
from 2619 G to 1595 G and then we constructed a po-
tential ﬁeld as the initial condition. The background
plasma density satisﬁes a hydrostatic isothermal model
with a value of 2.3 × 10−15 g cm−3 at bottom. To save
the computation time, the strength of magnetic ﬁeld
from the smoothed magnetogram is reduced by a factor
of 25. But this will make the plasma pressure and den-
sity decay slower than the background magnetic ﬁeld,
causing a higher plasma β, if we use the real value of
solar gravity (g(cid:12) = 274 m s−2). To avoid such a situa-
tion, we modiﬁed the gravity in the same way as Jiang
et al. (2021b):

g =

k
(1 + z/L)2 g(cid:12)
where k = 5.7 and L = 76.8 Mm.
In this way, the
plasma β around the active region is less than 0.1 under
340 Mm. The miminum value of plasma β is β = 2.5 ×
10−3. The Alfv´en speed VA > 1000 km s−1 below 190
Mm. These mimic the real corona environment better.

3.2. Boundary Conditions

We energized the system by applying a photospheric
rotational motion to the positive polarity at the bottom
boundary, as shown in Figure 4. To ensure that such
a ﬂow will not modify the magnetic ﬂux distribution
Bz at the photosphere, the velocity can be speciﬁed by
employing a potential function ψ(Bz) with v = ∇ ×
(ψez). While the speciﬁc forms of the potential function
in many previous researches (e.g., Amari et al. 2003;
Aulanier et al. 2010; T¨or¨ok et al. 2013; Jing et al. 2021)
made the line speed of rotation |v| vanish (|v| = |∇ψ| =
0) at PIL where Bz = 0. As a result the shear ﬂow near
PIL is relative weak. To make the shear ﬂow stronger,
the velocity potential was modiﬁed as:

ψ = v0Bz

and

vx =

∂ψ (Bz)
∂y

,

vy = −

∂ψ (Bz)
∂x

This velocity proﬁle can reproduce the strongest shear
ﬂow v = |∇ψ| = v0|∇Bz| at PIL and the faster line
speed of rotation in the north than south as observa-
tion shows (Min & Chae 2009). To save the computa-
tion time, v0 is scaled such that the maximum speed is
34.1 km s−1, which is about 60 times of the real value
as 0.5 km s−1 (Tan et al. 2009; Min & Chae 2009) but
still smaller than the typical Alfv´en speed by around two
orders of magnitude. With such a large driving speed,
the time scale of quasi-static evolution is shortened by
the same times. The photospheric motion is coupled
with the magnetic ﬁeld evolution by the frozen-in theo-
rem of ideal MHD, manifested as the line-tied condition,
which is important to the success of simulation. To self-
consistently update the bottom magnetic ﬁeld, we solve
the induction equation:

∂B
∂t

= ∇ × (v × B) + ηstable∇2

⊥B

(5)

at the photosphere. The last term ηstable∇2
⊥B is used to
maintain the numerical stability near the PIL (see also
Jiang et al. 2021a). Here we set:

ηstable = 1 × 10−2e−B2

z

(6)

On the side/top boundary, if we ﬁx the plasma vari-
ables (ρ, v, T ), there will be reﬂection. Instead, all the
variables are extrapolated from the neighboring inner
points using a zero gradient along the normal direc-
tion of the boundary surface. The normal component
of magnetic ﬁeld at side and top boundary is updated
by divergence−free condition to avoid the accumulation
of numerical error. This mimics the open boundary.

3.3. Topology

To analyse the magnetic structure, we calculated the
Q factor to identify the quasi separatrix layers (QSLs)
(Titov et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2016) as follows:

Q =

a2 + b2 + c2 + d2
|ad − bc|

where

a =

∂X
∂x

,

b =

∂X
∂y

,

c =

∂Y
∂x

,

d =

∂Y
∂y

(7)

(8)

and (X, Y ) and (x, y) are a pair of footpoints of the
same magnetic ﬁeld line. The region with large value
of Q (e.g., ≥ 105) denotes the most possible location
where reconnection will take place and is often used to
be compared with the position and shape of the ﬂare
ribbons.

4. RESULTS

4.1. Overall Process

Figure 5 shows the evolution curves of the total mag-
netic and kinetic energies in the computational volume
as well as their changing rates. The magnetic energy in-
jection by the surface motion is also shown (the dashed
line in Figure 5A), which is computed by time integra-
tion of the total Poynting ﬂux at the bottom surface. As
driven by the continual rotation of the sunspot for a time
duration of 190 min (in which SP has rotated about 3
turns), the AR in the MHD model experiences ﬁrstly an
overall increase of magnetic energy and then two erup-
tion events with rapid release of part of the magnetic
energy. The two eruptions can be identiﬁed clearly from
the energy evolution, with onset time tE1 = 119 min
for the ﬁrst eruption (will be referred to as E1) and
tE2 = 161 min for the second eruption (E2), respectively.
From the beginning to time of around t = 28 min, the
kinetic energy keeps a very low value of below 10−3 Ep,
and the magnetic energy injection curve matches well
with increase of the total magnetic energy, owing to the
line-tied boundary condition and the low numerical dis-
sipation. This ideal process is followed by two small
episodes of magnetic energy release that occur before
E1. The ﬁrst one (P1) starts at tP1 = 28 min, after
which the kinetic energy rises to 10−3 Ep, and it results
in a small deviation of the bottom surface energy input
and the total magnetic energy accumulation. The sec-
ond one (P2) occurs at tP2 = 80 min, after which the
kinetic energy ﬁrst rises to a peak value of 3.4 × 10−3 Ep
and then decreases slightly. The reason for these small
energy release will be analyzed in the next sections.

The ﬁrst major eruption (E1) begins when the mag-
netic energy reaches about 1.44Ep (and the sunspot
has been rotated about 1.5 turns). Through this erup-
tion, the magnetic energy decreases to about 1.36Ep
(8 × 10−2 Ep free energy loss) and the kinetic energy
increases impulsively to 3.6 × 10−2Ep. That is, about a
half of the magnetic energy loss is converted to kinetic
energy in 10 min. The amounts of magnetic energy re-
leased and total kinetic energy obtained, on the order
of magnitude of 1032 erg, are consistent with the es-
timations from previous studies that used NLFFF ex-
trapolations for the pre-ﬂare and post-ﬂare magnetic
ﬁelds (Schrijver et al. 2008; Ravindra & Howard 2010).
After the ﬁrst eruption, the magnetic energy increases
again while the kinetic energy drops to a low value close
to that of the pre-eruption state. At t ∼ 161 min starts
the second eruption (E2), a weaker one than the ﬁrst
eruption. The magnetic energy decreases from 1.41Ep
to 1.36Ep (5 × 10−2 Ep free energy loss). The kinetic

6

Wang et al.

energy increases to 2.8 × 10−2Ep and 56% magnetic en-
ergy has been converted to kinetic energy in around 10
min. The maximum erupting speed reaches 1500 km s−1
and 1100 km s−1 in E1 and E2, respectively. Both
eruptions drive a fast shock wave with speeds of about
500 km s−1. The complex distribution of magnetic ﬂux
in this AR renders the eruptions highly asymmetrical
in both north-south and west-east directions. Since the
magnetic ﬁeld is multiplied by a factor of 0.04, the ki-
netic energy should be underestimated in our simulation
because if we strengthen the magnetic ﬁeld used to cal-
culate, the ratio of kinetic energy to magnetic energy
will be increased.

Although it is not likely to reproduce realistically the
observed ﬂares with such simple setting of sunspot rota-
tion, these two eruptions can still mimic approximately
the observed two X-class ﬂares on December 13th and
14th, respectively, as the ﬁrst one, X3.4, is stronger than
the second one of X1.5. The positive sunspot has rotated
over 1.5 turns before E1, which is comparable with Min
& Chae (2009). Furthermore, if multiplied by a factor
of 60 determined by the speeding up in our velocity-
driven simulation, the quasi-static evolution time before
E1 is about 5 days and time interval between E1 and
E2 is about 40 hours. Both time scales are compara-
ble with observations: 3 days of sunspot rotation be-
fore E1 and another 44-hour interval between E1 and
E2.
Interestingly, there will be more eruptions, pro-
duced in a homologous way, if the simulation is con-
tinued with further rotation of the sunspot, conﬁrming
that the sunspot rotation is an eﬃcient mechanism in
producing eruptions. Finally it is worthy noting that
the total magnetic energy is always below the open ﬁeld
energy Eopen ∼ 1.51Ep (Aly 1984, 1991; Sturrock 1991)
during the whole process, suggesting that eruption is ef-
ﬁcient at keeping the magnetic energy below its upper
limit, i.e., the open ﬁeld energy.

4.2. Evolution of Magnetic Field and Electric Current

To understand why the energies evolve in the manner
as described in the last subsection, here we give a de-
tailed study on the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld, topology,
and current density. First we consider the magnetic ﬁeld
evolution before the major eruption.

The initial magnetic topology is shown in the ﬁrst
column of Figure 6C and F. It shows complex X-points
around, QSLs above and at the west (right) side of SP.
These initial QSLs play an important role in magnetic
evolution. Before tP1, P1-QSL, i.e., the QSL above SP,
was strengthened by stress between the sheared core
ﬁeld (which expands outward as driven by the rotation)
and the surroundings. This contributed to the forma-

tion of a current layer, referred to as P1-CS at the lo-
cation of P1-QSL. At the same time a current layer was
also developed above the main PIL between SP and SN,
for which we called the PIL-CS. It developed with ro-
tated SP between sunspots and didn’t show any sudden
changes. These current layers before tP1 were not strong
enough, i.e., not suﬃciently thin to trigger reconnection,
so the kinetic energy remained to be a very small value.
The magnetic energy injection from the bottom bound-
ary and its increase in the coronal volume matched each
other well, showing the signature of quasi-static evolu-
tion in this period.

P1-CS took eﬀect when it became strong enough after
tP1. The core expansion let the P1-CS (the gray iso-
surface in Figure 6B) form at the top of SP and trans-
late to west side subsequently, with exactly the same
location of P1-QSL (Figure 6C, D, F and G). Recon-
nection in P1-CS let WN connect to SP continuously,
leading to the exchanges of SP-SN and WP-WN (as in
Figure 6A). The current layer PIL-CS was still too weak
before tP2 while kept developing (Figure 6B). Weak out-
ﬂow (500 km s−1) were produced by slow reconnection in
P1-CS (Figure 6E and H) which accounts for the devia-
tion between magnetic energy injection from the bottom
surface and energy accumulation between tP1 and tP2.
The third stage began after tP2. The magnetic struc-
ture is very similar with an eruption: a rising MFR,
the reconnected arcades and a PIL-CS can be seen (Fig-
ure 7A, B and C). Though with these similarities, the
distribution of outﬂow and speed show the diﬀerence
(Figure 7D). The MFR is located at the PIL-CS and
two parts of outﬂow has the same position with the in-
tersection of the slice and MFR (Figure 8A). After we
move the slice to east side, the two parts become a single
one (Figure 8A). This suggests the location of reconnec-
tion was at the east side of SP. Checking the topology of
magnetic structure we found that, due to the complex-
ity of magnetic ﬂux distribution, the initial ﬁeld has a
QSL (referred to as P2-QSL) at east (left) (Figure 8B).
The existence of the initial P2-QSL made reconnection
can take place at the location of P2-QSL before PIL-
CS’s width reached grid resolution. When enough mag-
netic ﬁeld and current were transported to SP east, the
second weak energy release process began with outﬂow
speed about 500 km s−1. Since we only rotated SP and
other parts stayed nearly potential (Figure 4), the slow
outﬂow will be restricted by the overlying ﬁeld to be the
‘horizontal ﬂow’ (Figure 7D), which has merely velocity
in x and y directions. The same as in P1, the mechanism
here is diﬀerent from eruption: the energy conversion is
resulted by the slow reconnection near the initial QSL
but not fast reconnection in PIL-CS. This is the key rea-

Simulation of AR 10930 eruption

son why P2 is also a weak energy release episode. At the
end of P2, the reconnected arcades connected to SP and
SN, keeping rotating and preparing for the next erup-
tion. Reconnection in side P1-CS existed all the time
and transformed WP-WN to SP-WN (Supplementary
Video 1), which let more ﬁeld lines participate in the
formation of PIL-CS next time. These are ready for the
ﬁrst major eruption (E1).

During the periods as described above, converging mo-
tion towards PIL induced by rotation kept thinning the
CS between SP and SN (PIL-CS) with a speed as the
same order of rotation, i.e., 2 orders of magnitude lower
than local VA (Alfv´en speed), thus representing the
‘quasi-static evolution’. Owing to the very low magnetic
diﬀusion in our code, we can get a very thin CS even
with such a low speed. Otherwise, a larger magnetic
diﬀusion will widen the CS against the converge mo-
tion, as pointed out in Jiang et al. (2021b). The fourth
bunch of ﬁeld lines (labeled by the red arrow in Fig-
ure 9A) became SP-WN (Figure 9A) and took eﬀect to
form a stronger PIL-CS by rotational post-P2 arcades.
The trigger PIL-CS grow up from the bottom of simu-
lation box by continuous rotation (Figure 9C) until the
thickness of PIL-CS reached 2-3 grid resolution. Then
numerical diﬀusion became non-negligible and triggered
the fast reconnection and the fourth stage, namely, the
major eruption (E1) began. The PIL-CS also extended
to WN (Figure 9F), which corresponds to the longer ﬂare
ribbon on December 13th 2006. Reconnection in PIL-
CS formed an MFR during the eruption (Figure 9B).
The plasma outﬂow originated from the PIL-CS with a
speed reaching up to 1500 km s−1 (Figure 9D) and im-
pulsively drove MFR to erupt (as shown in Supplemen-
tary Video 2A). Meanwhile, the PIL-CS became longer
in the vertical direction, thinner and stronger (Figure 9C
and Supplementary Video 2B), with more ﬂux involved
into reconnection, which provides the energy required
for this eruption. With such a high speed, this eruption
was strong enough to remove the restriction of overlying
ﬁeld (which also occurred in E2) and no ‘horizontal ﬂow’
can be seen in Figure 9D and 10D. At the end of E1,
the reconnected arcades SP-SN restored and kept rotat-
ing as before (Figure 9A). While SP-WN returned to its
origin WP-WN (labeled by the red arrow in Figure 9A)
and was out of control of rotation.

When the arcades SP-SN formed after E1 was sheared
enough again, the ﬁfth stage began (after tE2). The
same as in E1, the PIL-QSL along with PIL-CS grew up
again from bottom near PIL. Reconnection in PIL-CS
formed an MFR (Figure 10B), which was lift up by the
outﬂow (with the speed of 1100 km s−1) initiated from
PIL-CS (Figure 10D and Supplementary Video 3A). The

side P1-CS always existed and transformed the ﬁeld line
connection of WP-WN to that of SP-WN, while the time
duration of side reconnection before tE2 was not so long
as that before tE1. As a result, less magnetic ﬂux was in-
volved in the formation of PIL-CS (the ﬁeld lines labeled
by red arrow in Figure 10A remain WP-WN), which
made the eruption CS weaker than E1 (Figure 10C) and
shorter in the vertical direction (Supplementary Video
3B). The ﬂare ribbon and PIL-CS (Figure 10F) were
shorter also in the horizontal direction. This naturally
leads to the fact that the magnetic energy release in E2
is less than that in E1. We note that when E2 began, the
current sheet of E1 didn’t disappear (Figure 10C), and in
a short interval, the latter eruption (E2) caught up with
the former one (E1), making the shock in E2 clearer.
After the eruption, the post-ﬂare arcades should restore
to the pre-ﬂare conﬁguration again, and if with further
rotation of the sunspot, it will lead to the third erup-
tion which is beyond the scope of this event research.
We stopped the simulation at t ∼ 190 min, showing the
whole process of magnetic evolution of 2 eruptions and
the reasons for such changes.

4.3. Comparison with Observations

To show the credibility of our simulation, our results
are compared with the observed X-ray and Hα features,
time scale, rotation angle, magnetic energy release and
relative strength of the eruptions.

In general, QSLs denotes the location where reconnec-
tion is most likely to take place and their footpoints at
the bottom surface represent the position of ﬂare ribbons
(Titov et al. 2002). Figure 3 shows the comparison of
the bottom QSLs for the two simulated eruptions with
the ﬂare ribbons as observed for the two ﬂares. Dur-
ing both eruptions, the QSLs are overall consistent in
shape and position with observed ﬂare ribbons: QSL-N
(corresponding to the negative ﬂare ribbon) was located
near the main PIL between two sunspots. QSL-P (cor-
responding to the positive ribbon) was initially at the
east (left) of the positive sunspot and then shrank into a
quasi-circular shape to the west (right). Both are com-
parable with the evolution of ﬂare ribbons, especially
the QSL-N, which extended longer in E1 than E2 (Fig-
ure 3). This was formed by the side reconnection in
P1-CS, which transformed ﬁeld connection of WP-WN
to SP-WN as described in Section 4.2 and as a result
the west ﬁeld lines were involved in the eruption. Sig-
moids in soft X-ray images (Figure 11) before both ﬂares
were located at the main PIL and bent towards the pos-
itive sunspot by sunspot rotation. These observed fea-
tures are comparable with the synthetic images of coro-

8

Wang et al.

nal emission from current density (Jiang et al. 2016b)
and simulated magnetic structure (Figure 11).

Quantitatively, the simulation can also yield consis-
tence in timing and magnetic energy release as men-
tioned in Section 4.1. There were 5 days rotation before
E1 and another 40-hour interval between E1 and E2.
Both time scales are comparable with actual evolution
time: 3 days rotation before E1 and 44 hours time inter-
val between eruptions on December 13th and December
14th. The positive sunspot has rotated over 1.5 turns
before the ﬁrst eruption in our simulation, which is con-
sistent with the total rotational angle of 540◦ as derived
in Min & Chae (2009). The magnetic energy release in
E1 in our simulation is ∆Emag = 3.6 × 1032 erg, which
is very close to the values derived with other methods in
previous researches of ∆Emag ∼ 3 × 1032 erg (Schrijver
et al. 2008; Ravindra & Howard 2010). From obser-
vation, the CME on December 13th (1780 km s−1) is
faster than on December 14th (1042 km s−1), which is
consistent with our simulation.

The Hα ﬁgures also show some observational evidence
corresponding to P1 and P2 episodes as labeled by the
white arrow in Figure 12. The Hα brightening has the
similar location of P1-CS in Figure 12 A and P2-QSL
in Figure 12B and C respectively. This indicates the
slow reconnection there before the major eruption as
described in Section 4.2. These results enhance the cred-
ibility of our simulation.

It should be noted that our simulation simpliﬁed the
photospheric motions in many aspects, which could af-
fect the results. We did not include the ﬂux emer-
gence process of the rotating sunspot, its shearing mo-
tion (from west to east) with respect to the leading
sunspot SP, and the colliding motion between the two
main sunspots (Wang et al. 2008). For example, if we
move the positive sunspot from west to east, the QSL-
N in E1 may be longer since when the positive sunspot
is located further east, it will connect to WN with a
stronger sheared conﬁguration. Larger computational
domain is also helpful to obtain a longer QSL: once the
MFR reaches the top or lateral boundaries, the closed
ﬁeld lines will be taken as the open ﬁeld and can’t be
shown by Q factor calculation. These adjustment has
potential to get a higher degree of consistence between
simulated QSLs and observed ﬂare ribbons. Also the
converge motions (i.e., the collision of the two sunspots)
will shorten the evolution time since it will enhance the
building up of the PIL-CS and enhance the amount of
the magnetic energy release by strengthening the mag-
netic gradient near PIL (Bian et al. 2022b). Though
more complex motions and settings may reproduce the
ﬂares more realistically, our result shows the key role

played by sunspot rotation in leading to the eruptions
and can shed light on the onset mechanism of this ho-
mologous event.

4.4. Eruption Initiation Mechanism

There are two types of CS in our simulation: the for-
mation of CSs in P1 and P2 which are responsible for
slow reconnection depends on the initial topology while
PIL-CS formed by continuous shear near PIL which ac-
counts for the main energy release in E1 and E2. As the
sunspot rotation brought ﬁeld lines together, the mag-
netic ﬁeld expanded slowly in P1 and was translated
to P2-QSL in P2. This leaded to the squeeze between
core ﬁeld and the surroundings. Then a squeezed QSL
formed at top (Figure 6G) and the east (left) side of
the positive sunspot (Figure 8). Slow reconnection here
changed the magnetic topology without eruptions. Dur-
ing the same period, converging motion induced by ro-
tational ﬂow made PIL-CS stronger and thinner. When
the CS’s thickness reached down to the grids width,
magnetic gradient near CS will be strong enough to let
the diﬀusion kick in. This mimicked essentially the non-
uniform magnetic diﬀusivity as required in the Pescheck-
type reconnection (Yokoyama & Shibata 1994): the re-
sistivity depends sensitively on the local current density,
and ﬁnally leaded to fast reconnection and eruption.

Figure 13C shows the temporal evolution of velocity
at approximately the middle point of the ﬁeld lines as
shown in Figure 13A and B, respectively. These ﬁeld
lines are used to illustrate the dynamics of the ﬁeld
that experienced reconnection and became part of the
MFR subsequently in the two eruptions, E1 and E2.
Once the reconnection took place, the coronal plasma
as frozen with the ﬁeld lines was accelerated impulsively
from a few 10 km s−1 to over 1000 km s−1. This accel-
eration was accomplished by the strong slingshot eﬀect
of the upward concave magnetic ﬁeld lines as labeled
by the white arrow in the middle panel of Figure 13A
and B. Shortly after the impulsive acceleration, the up-
ward tension force changed sign to a downward one since
the magnetic ﬁeld lines relaxed quickly from upward to
downward concave shape. As a result, the ﬁeld lines
experienced deceleration from above 1000 km s−1 to
around 600 km s−1, which is consistent with the MFR
acceleration process described in Jiang et al. (2021b),
suggesting the magnetic reconnection played the key role
in initiating the two eruptions.

We also estimated the possible role played by torus
instability in driving the eruptions of E1 and E2. To do
this, we need to calculate the decay index n of the strap-
ping ﬁeld (often approximated by the potential ﬁeld
model) overlying the erupting MFRs. Since the poten-

Simulation of AR 10930 eruption

9

tial ﬁeld is not always a good approximation of the strap-
ping ﬁeld (especially when the overlying ﬁeld is substan-
tially sheared), we also calculated the decay index of
our simulated ﬁeld for comparison in Figure 13D and
E. The decay index was derived along the white dashed
line in Figure 13A and B, which denotes the eruption
direction following the method proposed by Duan et al.
(2019). The critical height of simulated ﬁeld (above
which n > 1.5) is located at 50 Mm in E1 and above
60 Mm in E2. The reconnection point (labeled by the
white arrow in the middle panel of Figure 13A) is lo-
cated at the height of 50-60 Mm in E1, which indicates
the MFR axis entered the unstable region. Therefore,
when the MFRs in E1 was formed, the torus instabil-
ity was possible to be triggered to drive the eruption
in addition to the reconnection. While the MFR axis
in E2 is located below 60 Mm and the torus instability
had little chance to take eﬀect. This may be an addi-
tional reason why E1 is stronger than E2, as the over-
lying ﬁeld of E1 decays faster with height than that in
E2. It is also worthy noting that, PIL-CSs were formed
before the onset of both eruptions, or in other words,
they were all formed in a quasi-static way before MFR
exists. Then an MFR was formed synchronously with
the reconnection and acceleration in PIL-CSs (Supple-
mentary Video 2A and 3A). The acceleration process of
the erupting MFR was accomplished under the critical
height of torus instability in E2 while above the critical
height in E1 as shown in Figure 13C. Furthermore, the
MFRs experienced a deceleration process after the im-
pulsive acceleration phase, and this deceleration occurs
even in the torus unstable region of two eruptions, which
clearly indicated the torus instability was not the main
factor controlling the dynamics of the MFRs. There-
fore, though torus instability had the potential to be
triggered and helped the acceleration in E1, magnetic
reconnection was the main initiation mechanism of both
eruptions.

The P1-CS formed at the top of the positive sunspot
initially and the four polarities: SP, SN, WP and WN
constituted a quadrupolar topology. One may compare
this situation with the breakout model: P1-CS corre-
sponds to the breakout CS which opens the overlying
ﬁeld of the eruptive core in the quadrupolar conﬁgura-
tion. However, our case is unlike the breakout model in
which the reconnection at the breakout CS plays the key
role in triggering eruption. In our simulation, the main
consequence of slow reconnection in P1-CS is changing
the magnetic connectivity, which can make E1 stronger,
but it is not required to trigger the eruption. Continu-
ous sunspot rotation can initiate the eruption alone from
sheared PIL-CS. This clearly suggests that the mecha-

nism as demonstrated here is a fundamental one, which
is consistent with that shown in Jiang et al. (2021b) and
Bian et al. (2022a).

5. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this paper, using our velocity-driven DARE-MHD
model, we have simulated the two eruptions of NOAA
AR 10930 on December 13th 2006 and December 14th
2006 continuously. Our simulation started from a po-
tential ﬁeld obtained by the observed magnetogram and
with a simple rotation ﬂow applied to one of the main
magnetic polarities at the bottom surface to mimic the
sunspot rotation. Owing to the complex distribution
of the magnetic ﬂux, there were two slow reconnection
processes in P1 and P2 before the ﬁrst major eruption,
which helped building the special magnetic topology.
When sunspot rotated over 1.5 turns, the most strong
CS formed near the main PIL. Fast reconnection in PIL-
CS formed an MFR and the reconnection outﬂow ejected
the coronal plasma violently. The PIL-CS was stretched
to be longer, stronger and thinner, and continuous re-
connection released the energy required by E1. After
this eruption, the post-ﬂare arcades of E1 were further
stressed by the rotating sunspot with about another half
turn, during which the PIL-CS forms again and then the
second major eruption began, which is very similar to
the homologous eruption mechanism as shown in Bian
et al. (2022a). The PIL-CS between sunspots was de-
veloped from bottom and reconnection sets in to trigger
the eruption when the width was comparable with grid
resolution like in E1. Though E1 and E2 had the same
mechanism, there were less magnetic ﬂux participated
in E2, which made the CS and also the eruption in E2
weaker than in E1. Two eruptions have reasonable con-
sistency with observations in relative strength, magnetic
energy loss, sunspot rotation angle in the pre-ﬂare dura-
tion, observed X-ray and Hα features, as well as eruption
time interval.

Our simulation oﬀers a scenario diﬀerent from many
previous studies. For example, diﬀerent from Amari
et al. (2014), in which they drove an NLFFF extrap-
olated for about 6 hours before the eruption to erupt
by using three diﬀerent types of photospheric boundary
conditions, we started the simulation from the poten-
tial ﬁeld. Moreover, the continuous energy accumula-
tion and release process has been produced in a more
self-consistent way, by applying a more realistic condi-
tion, i.e., the rotation of the positive sunspot at the
bottom boundary. The key magnetic structure in favor
of initiating the eruption can form by sunspot rotation
directly. In addition, a pre-eruption MFR that emerged
through the photosphere as described in Fan (2011) is

10

Wang et al.

not necessary in our simulation for triggering the erup-
tion. The sunspot rotation can form an MFR by fast
reconnection in the pre-formed PIL-CS during E1 and
E2, but not before. Furthermore, most researches of AR
10930 are only focused on the X3.4 ﬂare on December
13th and few of them have studied the relationship of the
two ﬂares (the other X1.5 ﬂare on December 14th). Our
results show the two events can be triggered in the same
way by fast reconnection in the CS formed in a recurrent
manner by sunspot rotation as described in Section 4.
Since sunspot rotation is a persistent motion for days,
our result suggests an eﬃcient way of continuous energy
injection, which can reproduce the homologous eruption
in AR 10930.

The importance of sunspot rotation has also been
taken into consideration in some previous researches
while the corresponding numerical models were estab-
lished in diﬀerent ways. To investigate the eﬀect of
sunspot rotation in AR 10898, T¨or¨ok et al. (2013) ro-
tated a envelop ﬁeld of a pre-existing MFR. As the the
envelop ﬁeld expanded progressively, the MFR became
unstable and triggered to erupt by torus instability. Jing
et al. (2021) rotated the reconstructed potential ﬁeld of
AR 12665 along with ﬂux emergence at the PIL. As a
consequence, a sigmoidal structure formed with an over-
lying MFR created and rose to erupt like a CME. Com-
pared with these rotation-driven models, our model is
much simpler with only sunspot rotation and a potential
ﬁeld as the initial state, and the MFRs in our simulation
could form spontaneously at the onset time of reconnec-
tion in the pre-formed PIL-CS and erupted as a CME.
Both of the formation of MFR and PIL-CS were not re-
lated to the ﬂux emergence. The quasi-static evolution
and impulsive eruption process can be obtained solely
by the rotation of the initial potential ﬁeld.

Owing to the simple settings of our simulation in many
aspects, more realistic consideration should be taken in
future improvements of the model for reproducing the

eruptions. For example, the smoothing of magnetogram
have weakened the magnetic gradient near the main PIL.
As a consequence the eruption strength will decrease,
because according to Bian et al. (2022b), the eruption
strength is highly correlated with the magnetic gradient
of the main PIL. A more realistic velocity ﬁeld at photo-
sphere, including rotational, shearing and converge mo-
tions, derived from observation could be applied as the
boundary condition to get a more self-consistent and re-
alistic evolution (which has been shown in Jiang et al.
2021a and Jiang et al. 2022b). Another key point we
have not considered in the current model is the ﬂux
emergence process, for which the normal velocity (i.e.
velocity in z-direction) at photosphere ought to be used
to mimic the emergence process of sunspot.

To summarize, the whole process from potential ﬁeld
to eruption has been reproduced, showing the full MHD
evolution of slow energy accumulation to fast release.
Our simulation reveals the importance of sunspot ro-
tation and magnetic reconnection in eruption initiation
mechanism. The homologous eruptions as driven by
persistent photospheric motion and initiated by the
fundamental mechanism (Jiang et al. 2021b) may be
common in solar ARs. Future works will be carried out
with the aforementioned improvements for more realis-
tic modeling of solar eruptions that can be potentially
applied to the space weather forecast.

initial potential ﬁeld is Ep = 8.3 × 1030erg. This value should be multiplied by a factor of 625 = 1
which is the same order with previous results. The corresponding Supplementary Video 1 starts at t = 0 and ends at t = 185.5
min in simulation time, showing the evolution of J/B, the velocity distribution, QSLs, the magnetic ﬁeld lines and the kinetic
energy in the real time duration of 185.5 hours. The cadence between each ﬁgure used in Supplementary Video 1 is 210 s in the
quasi-static period (t ∈ [0, 112] ∪ [129.5, 157.5] ∪ [175, 185.5] min) and 21 s in the eruption period (t ∈ (112, 129.5) ∪ (157.6, 175)

Figure 13. A): 3 snapshots of the evolution of reconnected ﬁeld lines in E1. The vertical slice at x = 0 (at the middle of MFR)
is shown with the contour of velocity. All physical variables are displayed by the colorbar in the ﬁrst panel. B): Same as A but
the vertical slice is located at x = −34.5 Mm. C): The solid lines denote the variation of the speed with respect to height z of
the point which is the intersection of the reconnected ﬁeld lines and the vertical slice in A (E1) and B (E2), respectively. The
green (red) dashed line denotes the critical height of torus instability in E1 (E2). D): Variation of decay index n with respect
to height z along the white dashed line on the slice in the ﬁrst panel of A. The dashed line in D denotes the decay index n of
simulated ﬁeld at t ∼118 min and the solid line denotes the result of the corresponding potential ﬁeld at the same time. E):
Same as D but n is calculated along the white dashed line in the ﬁrst panel of B at t ∼161 min.
