Abstract

Nuclear liquid-gas phase transitions are investigated in the framework of static antisymmetrized molecular dynam-
ics (static AMD) model under either a constant volume or a constant pressure. A deuteron quadrupole momentum
ﬂuctuation thermometer is applied to extract the temperature of fragmenting systems of 36Ar and 100Sn. A plateau

structure of caloric curves is observed under a constant volume for those system with a density ρ
backbending in the caloric curves, which indicates a ﬁrst order phase transition, is observed under a constant pressure
with all pressures studied. The similar behavior of caloric curves of 36Ar and 100Sn systems indicates that there is no
strong system size eﬀect under a constant volume or a constant pressure. Both the mass distributions and the light
particle multiplicities show a strong α clusterization at low excitation energies in the static AMD simulations. The
liquid-gas phase transition measures of the multiplicity derivative (dM/dT) and the normalized variance of Zmax (NVZ)
are applied. The experimental caloric curves are also compared with those of 100Sn of the static AMD simulations
under both the constant volume and the constant pressure conditions. Discussions are presented with the available
experimental results and those from the static AMD simulations. Large errors in the experimental temperature mea-
surements and those in the reconstruction technique for the primary fragmenting source hinder to draw a conclusion
whether the phase transition occurs under either a constant volume or a constant pressure. This study suggests that
diﬀerent measures for the liquid-gas phase transitions should be examined besides the caloric curves in order to draw
a conclusion.

I. Introduction

Nuclear multifragmentation process was ﬁrst pre-
dicted in 1930s [1] and has been extensively studied
following the advent of 4π detectors [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. It
provides a wealth of information on nuclear dynamics,
properties of the nuclear equation of state (EOS), pos-
sible nuclear liquid-gas phase transition among others.
The nuclear liquid-gas phase transition was ﬁrst stud-
ied in the early 1980s [7, 8, 9] and has long been a hot
topic of contemporary nuclear physics. It was suggested
in the experimental observations and theoretical simu-
lations, due to the resemblance between the equation of
state of homogeneous nuclear matter and homogeneous
Van der Waals matter.

In the past four decades, many experimental and the-
oretical works have been devoted to searching for the
signals of the liquid-gas phase transition in the Fermi
energy heavy-ion collisions and relativistic energy pro-
jectile fragmentations. Measures used for the stud-
ies are the nuclear speciﬁc heat capacity (the caloric
curves) [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24],
the bimodality in charge asymme-
try [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], the Fisher droplet model
analysis [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], the Landau
free energy approach [39, 36, 37, 40, 41, 42, 43], the
moment of the charge distributions [44, 45, 46, 47, 33],
the ﬂuctuation properties of the heaviest fragment size

tion [56, 57] and the derivative of cluster size [58]. The
liquid drop model parameters [59], the clusterization al-
gorithms [60] eﬀects on the liquid-gas phase transition,
the ﬁnite-size scaling phenomenon [61], the critical pa-
rameters and the microscopic predictions of the liquid-
gas phase transition were also studied recently [62, 63].
Many considerable progresses have been accomplished
on the theoretical and experimental studies.

In our recent studies [64, 65], several measures
among listed above were investigated and the solidarity
of the signal of these measures for diﬀerent sizes, N/Z
asymmetries and volumes of the fragmenting system
were examined in the framework of the statistical multi-
fragmentation model (SMM) [66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71], in
which the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition occurs in
a constant volume. In the references, a clear signal for
the ﬁrst order phase transition is observed for the exam-
ined measures, and the charge distributions for diﬀerent
system sizes provide an instructive picture for the sig-
nals observed in the SMM events. No system size eﬀect
is observed in them. This is quite diﬀerent from the re-
sults by the percolation model or the lattice gas model,
in which the phase transition signatures become promi-
nent when the system size increases [72, 73, 74, 75].
These measures were also experimentally studied using
reactions of 40Ar+27Al, 48Ti and 58Ni at 40 A MeV and
clear signals for a possible liquid-gas phase transition
were observed [76].

In the SMM adopted in our previous studies of
Refs. [64, 65], a constant volume is assumed for the
breakup system and a spherical volume with the normal
density is assigned for the fragments, and their kinetic
energies are determined from the energy balance.
In
this article, these studies are extended in the framework
of static antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (static
AMD) model [20, 21], where the multi-fragmentation
is treated in a quantum branching process and the frag-
ments can be deformed in the phase space. This arti-
cle is organized as follows: Brief descriptions of the
static AMD and the deuteron quadrupole momentum
ﬂuctuation thermometer are presented in Sec. II. The
caloric curves under constant volume and constant pres-
sure conditions are presented in Sec. III. The liquid-gas
phase transition measures in the static AMD are shown
in Sec. IV. Comparisons with the available experimen-
tal data are carried out in Sec. V. A brief summary is
given in Sec. VI.

In AMD [77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82], the reaction system
with N nucleons is described as a Slater determinant of

where M is the mass of nucleons, A is the mass num-
ber of system, NF (Z) is the fragment number, and T0 is
3~2ν/2M in principle but treated as a free parameter for
the adjustment of the binding energies. The wave packet
diﬀusion process [79] is taken into account stochasti-
cally in the time evolution of the wave packets in order
to make a proper multifragmentation of hot nuclear mat-
ter generated during collisions.

Similar to other transport models, there are two sep-
arated processes, one is the mean ﬁeld propagation of
nucleons and the other is the nucleon-nucleon (NN) col-
lision process. The mean ﬁeld propagation is governed
by a given eﬀective interaction and the NN collision
rate is determined by a given NN cross section. Pauli
principle is fully respected in an exact manner in both
processes. Throughout this paper, the Gogny interac-
tion [83] is used for the mean ﬁeld.

In the static AMD [20, 21], the eﬀective Hamilto-
is modiﬁed for a better treatment of the gaseous

nian

nucleons, which is important for the temperature mea-
surement. The NF (Z) is modiﬁed to take into account
the number of isolated fragments and nucleons together.
The potential energies between the gaseous nucleons are
mod(Z)
also modiﬁed by adding an additional term of
(3). The diﬀusion component of the original
in Eq.
width of wave packet is also improved for the stochastic
single particle motion to fully satisfy the energy conser-
vation and to precisely evaluate the temperature.

Instead of using the NN collisions as the decoherence
process, a diﬀerent decoherence process is adopted in
the static AMD, which takes place with the probability
of 1/τ0 per unit time, where τ0 is a characteristic co-
herence time. This decoherence process aﬀects all the
nucleons located within the relative radius of 2 fm if
more than three nucleons are found within this radius.
Three diﬀerent coherence time τ0 (250, 500 and 1000
fm/c) were studied in Ref. [20] and found that they cor-
respond to diﬀerent level density parameter a for the liq-
uid caloric curve. Later the decoherence process was
further improved and τ0 was readjusted as 5 fm/c in
Ref. [21]. Therefore, the same parameter τ0 = 5 fm/c
is used throughout this paper.

An irregular surface reﬂection process at the con-
tainer wall is introduced in the static AMD [20, 21]
to keep nucleons inside the container with a given ra-
dius rwall. For each time step, nucleons i and j belong
to the same cluster if the relative distance at the physi-
< 0.8. If an isolated nucleon
cal coordinate
k is located outside the container and its momentum
pk = 2~ √νImZk directs outward, an inward momentum
direction ˆp′k = p′k/
is randomly chosen, which satis-
ﬁes rk
√ν ReZk. The absolute value
is adjusted so as to conserve the
of the momentum
total energy which is sometimes aﬀected by antisym-
metrization. The total angular momentum of the system
is not conserved, which allows one to construct a micro-
canonical ensemble in a single run. A similar reﬂection
procedure is applied to the center of mass coordinate
of a cluster if any of the nucleon in the cluster is lo-
cated outside the container wall to avoid the unphysical
breaking of the cluster.

where the summation is taken over all the reﬂection nu-

each reﬂection and ˆn is the normal vector. The factor
2 comes from the fact that when a nucleon or fragment
hits the wall, the total momentum of the rest system is
also changed to conserve the momentum.

The static AMD calculations are performed with the
excitation energy Ex/A ranging from 2 MeV to 25 MeV
with step of 0.5 MeV for 36Ar and 100Sn. The rwall rang-
ing from 5 fm to 14.5 fm (ρ from 0.00282 to 0.0688

is calculated up to 55000 fm/c for 36Ar and 25000 fm/c
for 100Sn. The output data are collected for the time
step of 10 fm/c. Three individual runs are performed to
increase the statistics.

but Ex/A = 8 and 20 MeV, respectively. One can see
that for the cases in Fig. 1, a short time is needed for sys-
tems to achieve a thermal equilibrium. The maximum
time to achieve the thermal equilibrium is less than 4000
fm/c among the calculations mentioned above. There-
fore, the same as that in Refs. [20, 21], the ﬁrst 5000
fm/c states are discarded in the following analysis.

Several experimental thermometers such as the ki-
netic energy slope thermometer [84, 85], the isotopic ra-
tio thermometer [86, 87], the population of excited state
thermometer [88, 89], the ﬂuctuation thermometer [90,
91] and the temperature extracted by the Thomas-Fermi
approach [92], have been proposed in the past to eval-
uate the temperature of the hot nuclear matter. In the
static AMD, the temperature of system is obtained from
the average kinetic energy of nucleons in a gaseous
subsystem. However, it is diﬃcult in deﬁning such a
gaseous subsystem without the measured source veloc-
ity in nuclear reaction experiments.

In our previous work, a deuteron quadrupole momen-
tum ﬂuctuation thermometer was proposed in the exper-
imental data analysis [76]. Using a classical Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution of momentum yields, a temper-
ature from the quadrupole momentum ﬂuctuation of a
prob particle is derived by Wuenschel et al. [90] as

where px and py are the transverse components of the
fragment momentum. According to the SMM simula-
tion [76], the deuteron quadrupole momentum ﬂuctua-
tion thermometer is adopted to minimize the Coulomb
and the secondary decay eﬀects.

In Fig. 2, the temperatures extracted by the deuteron
quadrupole momentum ﬂuctuation (open circles) and
the average kinetic energy [20, 21] (solid circles) are
compared and good agreements are observed. To get the
caloric curve under a constant pressure, the temperature
is obtained from the interpolation of T vs P curve at a
given pressure for each excitation energy. The caloric
curves under a constant volume and under a constant
pressure are shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (c), respectively,
which will be discussed further in detail in the next sec-
tion. The derived speciﬁc heat capacity (Cv) are shown
in Fig. 2 (b) and (d) with smoothing over seven points

in the caloric curves. Under a constant volume case,
temperature increases rather smoothly as the excitation
energy increases and one can only see a possible liquid-
gas phase transition as a shoulder structure at Ex/A = 8
- 15 MeV, which corresponds to the peak at Cv around
T = 6 MeV. On the contrary, under a constant pressure
case, the liquid-gas phase transition is clearly observed
as a backbending at Ex/A = 8 - 15 MeV, which cor-
responds to the negative Cv between T = 6 - 8 MeV.
Slightly larger ﬂuctuation is observed for the deuteron
quadrupole momentum ﬂuctuation thermometer values
in the lower excitation energy side, because deuterons
have less probability at these low excitation energies.
Since the good agreement of the temperature obtained
by the deuteron quadrupole momentum ﬂuctuation and
the average kinetic energy, the deuteron quadrupole mo-
mentum ﬂuctuation thermometer is used in the follow-
ing analysis. It is adopted also for the direct compar-
isons between the AMD simulations and experimental
observations in future.

III. Caloric curves under constant volume and con-
stant pressure

Sobotka once argued whether one should use the
Helmholtz free energy (under a constant volume) or the
Gibbs free energy (under a constant pressure) to charac-
terize the hot nuclear matter observables [93]. Experi-
mentally, when a nuclear liquid-gas phase transition oc-
curs during the expansion, whether it takes place under a
constant volume or under a constant pressure is diﬃcult
to distinguish. Here we propose a possible scenario to

 
 
distinguish these processes, using the static AMD sim-
ulated events of 36Ar and 100Sn.

The calculations are done in discrete rwall for both
36Ar and 100Sn systems.
It is diﬃcult to ﬁnd exactly
the same density for 36Ar and 100Sn at the rwall se-
lected. Therefore, similar to the constant pressure case,
the temperature for a given density is obtained from the
interpolation of T vs ρ curve for each excitation en-
ergy. Figure 3 shows the caloric curves of 36Ar (solid
circles) and 100Sn (open circles) under the constant vol-
ume of nine diﬀerent densities. The lines correspond to
Eg.s./A, (Eg.s./A = -8.5 MeV for 36Ar
Ex/A = 3/2T
and -7.9 MeV for 100Sn), and the dashed curves corre-
spond to Ex/A = aT 2 with a = 1/8 are shown for com-
parison. One can see from Fig. 3 that the trend of the
caloric curves for 36Ar and 100Sn are very similar for a
given density. A degraded plateau structure is found for
3, which indicates the liquid-gas
densities ρ > 0.03 fm−
phase transition happens below the densities ρ = 0.03
3. Above this density, both the two systems stay in
fm−
liquid phase all the time and the caloric curves follow
well the curve of Ex/A = aT 2. A plateau structure is
developed as the density decreases. As discussed in our
previous work [65], the similar plateau temperatures at a

given density (ρ
reﬂect a negligible dependence of the phase transition
temperature on the system size.

served in the caloric curves at each given pressure. This
is a distinct diﬀerence from those under a constant vol-
ume. The backbendings are observed similarly under all
pressures examined. At lower excitation energies, the
systems are in the liquid phase and no gaseous nucleons
or light fragments are produced, causing the left end of
the calculated caloric curves stop at the dashed curve.
For a given pressure, the phase transition temperatures
are similar for 36Ar and 100Sn, which again indicates no
system size eﬀect for the phase transition temperature
under the constant pressure condition in the static AMD
simulations.

IV. Liquid-gas phase transition measures in static
AMD

Several experimental measures were examined in our
previous works in the framework of SMM model [64,
65]. The multiplicity derivative (dM/dT) and the nor-
malized variance of Zmax (NVZ) were found to provide
accurate measures for the liquid-gas phase transition
temperature from both the primary and the secondary
fragments. In this section, the mass distributions, the
multiplicities of light particles, the dM/dT and the NVZ
are examined for the static AMD calculations.

The mass distributions of 36Ar system are shown in
3 (rwall = 5 fm, left column),
Fig. 5 for ρ = 0.0688 fm−
3 (rwall = 8 fm, middle column) and 0.0039
0.0168 fm−
3 (rwall = 13 fm, right column) and for the excita-
fm−
tion energies Ex/A = 2, 8, 14 and 20 MeV from top to
bottom. The fragments are identiﬁed by the relative dis-
tance of nucleons rclust
2.5 fm in the coordinate space.

≤

 
 
 
 
 
 
At low excitation energy of Ex/A = 2 MeV, the mass
distributions show large ﬂuctuations for diﬀerent mass
number A and the maximum yield appears at A = 4 for
all the densities investigated. When system evolves at
a higher density, the U shape distribution is found even
at the excitation energy Ex/A = 20 MeV. For the ρ =
3, the system evolves from two Ar like peaks
0.0168 fm−
to the power law distribution as the Ex/A increases. The
3 evolves more rapidly as the
system at ρ = 0.0039 fm−
Ex/A increases. As pointed out in Ref. [20], the mass
distribution depends signiﬁcantly on the choice of the
decoherence parameter τ0 and the cluster radius rclust.
Nevertheless, it is helpful for the qualitative understand-
ing of the evolution of the system under a constant vol-
ume and a constant pressure, together with the results in
Ref. [20].

excitation energies, which is a signiﬁcant contrast to the
strong α cluster enhancement at low densities observed
in the experiment [94]. The multiplicities of the other
light particles increase smoothly as the excitation en-
ergy increases. The α yield enhancement starts close
to the temperature where the liquid-gas phase transition
occurs when the temperature decreases, but the role of
this α clusterization for the liquid-gas phase transition
is not understood yet.

resemblance between Cv values in Figs. 2 (b), (d) and
dM/dT values Figs. 7(b), (e) where the same density and
pressure are used. The characteristic peak of dM/dT un-
der a constant volume are found for all the three den-
sities investigated. However, the peak temperature in-
creases and the width of the peak becomes broader as
the density increases under the constant volume condi-
tion, which is quite diﬀerent from that of SMM calcula-
tions in our previous work [65], where the peak temper-
ature stays same and the width becomes narrower as the
density increases. The reason could be the assumption
of a spherical shape of fragments used in SMM, whereas
in the static AMD, no shape assumption is used, which
aﬀects in the formation of clusters in the excitation en-
ergy and size. Similar to the Cv under the constant pres-
sure condition in Fig. 2 (d), the negative dM/dT is ob-
served for both 36Ar and 100Sn systems under the con-
stant pressure condition. The region of negative dM/dT
shifts to high temperature when the pressure increases.
A narrower region of negative dM/dT is also found for
100Sn system, which reﬂects a sharper liquid-gas phase
transition for larger system size under a constant pres-
sure condition.

Figure 8: (Color online) The same as that in Fig. 7 but for the normal-
ized variance of Zmax (NVZ) as a function of temperature. The data
are obtained with the smoothing of seven points of NVZ and temper-
ature.

At the temperature of the liquid-gas phase transition,
the system shows the maximum ﬂuctuation [33, 34, 35].
In order to see such a feature, the normalized variance
of Zmax (NVZ) are also investigated for both 36Ar and
100Sn systems. Figure 8 shows the NVZ as a function
of temperature under constant volume of density ρ =
3 in (a) (b) and (c), respec-
0.01, 0.015 and 0.02 fm−
tively, as well as those under constant pressure of P =
0.03, 0.05 and 0.07 MeV/fm3 in (d), (e) and (f), respec-
tively. The maximum value of NVZ appears at diﬀer-
ent temperatures, and these peaks appear at the temper-
atures lower than that from the dM/dT with signiﬁcant

broadening. Under the constant pressure, on the con-
trary, much sharper signals are observed for both sys-
tems for the liquid-gas phase transition. The maximum
value of NVZ agrees well with each other for the two
systems investigated under a constant pressure condi-
tion. The temperature increases and they correspond
more or less to those of dM/dT in the lower panels of
Fig. 7, especially for 100Sn. A slight broadening of the
signatures is observed for 36Ar system.

In these comparisons with diﬀerent measures, all in-
dicate that the temperatures for the liquid-gas phase
transitions depend on the density and pressure, but no
system size eﬀect is observed. Under a constant pres-
sure, the signal becomes much sharper at the liquid-gas
phase transition temperature, which corresponds to the
backbending of the caloric curves in Fig. 4.

V. Comparison with the available experimental data

In general, in nuclear collisions, the particle emitting
source is expanding and therefore the volume and pres-
sure is changing in time. However in the studies of Fu-
ruta and Ono in Ref. [21], they can identify the mass dis-
tribution at a given time from the dynamical simulation
of AMD to one of the ensembles from the static AMD.
This suggests that for a given system and a given excita-
tion energy, the maximum ﬂuctuation occurs at a certain
volume or a certain pressure. As seen in the previous
two sections, from the distinctive features of the mea-
sures under a constant volume or a constant pressure for
the liquid-gas phase transition, we may be able to dis-
tinguish these two conditions using the results from the
heavy ion experiments. In this section, we will compare
our static results with those obtained from the heavy ion
collisions.

mometers of the source mass ranges of A = 60 - 100 and

of 100Sn. Experimentally, the diﬀerence in the exper-
imental ﬁlter, the event classiﬁcation and the methods
applied to extract the temperature and the excitation en-
ergy may present quite diﬀerent caloric curves. It is not
our goal to go deep into the detail of the extraction of
caloric curve, but rather we focus on the comparison of
the trend of the caloric curve from the experiments and
that from the static AMD simulation, expecting to reveal
some clue for the liquid-gas phase transition.

The experimental caloric curves of source mass number
A = 60 - 100 and 100 - 140 are shown in Fig. 9 (b) and
(c). The experimental data are taken from Ref. [19],
in which the published data are sorted out in diﬀerent
source sizes. One should note that the scale of the x-
axis is diﬀerent between the simulation and the experi-
mental data. The two caloric curves of 100Sn with phase
transition temperature T
6 MeV from the AMD simu-
lations are compared to the experimental values. In the
experimental data, a plateau appears at Ex/A
3 to 5
MeV and last up to 10 MeV or more. The three points
at highest excitation energy for A = 100 - 140 in the
experimental data are not observed for A = 60 - 100 re-
sults, indicating more experimental data are necessary
for Ex/A > 10 MeV. No clear backbending is observed
in the experimental results within the experimental ac-
curacy. In the case of constant volume in the simulation
as shown in Fig. 3, the plateau appears at Ex/A = 5 -
10 MeV and last up to
15 MeV. On the other hand,
in the case of the constant pressure, the plateau starts
at excitation energy Ex/A less than 5 MeV and a back-
bending appears between 10 - 15 MeV. But by simply
looking at the results in Figs. 3 and 9, the experimental
results seem to favor that the liquid-gas phase transition
occurs under a constant or approximately constant pres-
sure. Unfortunately, this conclusion is not conclusive
within the current experimental accuracy.

stant pressures of PFO = 0.023-0.068 and 0.068-0.114

The caloric curves of the static AMD calculations of
100Sn system are plotted in Fig. 10 (a) for comparisons.
Even though the system size is around 200 for those in
Fig. 10 (b) and (c), these comparisons are reasonable
because no strong system size eﬀect is observed in the
static AMD results. The caloric curves with the internal
fragment thermometer are similar to those of the static
AMD, but show less dependence on the density or pres-
sure. Only a ﬂat plateau is observed in their result un-
der a constant pressure. Their results with the kinetic
energy thermometer seems problematic, since the tem-
peratures become far beyond the Fermi-gas curves (blue
solid and dashed curves), where a clear backbending is
observed under the constant pressure. It is possible that
the Coulomb or the dynamic eﬀects were not fully re-
moved in the reconstruction process. As suggested in
this article, it is important to cross-check their results,
using other measures with their freeze-out particles.

With the discussions above, the experimental uncer-
tainties in the former and the ambiguity in the freeze-
out event reconstruction in the latter certainly prevent to
draw a conclusion. Therefore, more precise measure-
ments of caloric curves in heavy ion collision experi-
ments are still needed. Diﬀerent measures other than
those studied in the last section may provide additional
evidence to the liquid-gas phase transition. Therefore,
diﬀerent measures for the liquid-gas phase transitions
should be examined besides the caloric curves to draw

 
 
 
 
 
a conclusion.

It should be noted that the plateau temperature of
the experimental caloric curves decreases as the sys-
tem size increases as shown in Ref. [19]. The caloric
curves extracted by the deuteron quadrupole momentum
ﬂuctuation from our recently analysis using reactions of
40Ar+27Al, 48Ti and 58Ni at 40 A MeV [76] also agree
with that from previous experiments of the system size
A = 30 - 60 using isotope ratio thermometer and He
slope thermometer [19]. This system size eﬀect is not
observed in the static AMD or the SMM simulations. It
could be the eﬀects of the dynamic process during the
heavy ion collisions, which still need further investiga-
tion. The consistent of the trend and the plateau temper-
ature in the caloric curves obtained with diﬀerent ther-
mometers suggests that the temperature is insensitive to
the extraction methods.

VI. Summary

The nuclear liquid-gas phase transitions under a con-
stant volume and a constant pressure condition are in-
vestigated in the framework of the static AMD. Using
the deuteron quadrupole momentum ﬂuctuation ther-
mometer, the caloric curves of fragmenting systems of
36Ar and 100Sn are extracted. A plateau structure of the
caloric curves is obtained under a constant volume for
3 for both the two sys-
those with density ρ
0.03 fm−
tems. A clear backbending in the caloric curve is ob-
served under a constant pressure condition for all the
pressures studied here. Distinct diﬀerences are observed
for the signature of the liquid-gas phase transition mea-
sures under a constant volume or a constant pressure.
The Similar behavior of caloric curves for 36Ar and
100Sn indicates there is no strong system size eﬀect in
the static AMD simulations.

≤

The studies of light particle multiplicities indicate the
α cluster enhancements at low excitation energy for all
rwall investigated in the static AMD calculations. Signa-
tures of the liquid-gas phase transition are observed in
dM/dT and NVZ, but the signature is more prominent
under a constant pressure and their temperature changes
according to the density or pressure. The temperature
extracted by the NVZ deviates from that of dM/dT and
caloric curves under the constant volume condition, but
the results under the constant pressure condition agree
with those of dM/dT and caloric curves.

The experimental caloric curves are also compared
with those of 100Sn of the static AMD simulation under
a constant volume and a constant pressure conditions.
The comparisons indicate that the liquid-gas phase tran-
sition occurs between a constant volume and a constant

pressure, but more experimental studies are necessary
to make a conclusive remarks. This study suggests that
diﬀerent measures for the liquid-gas phase transitions
should be examined besides the caloric curves in order
to draw a conclusion. The system size eﬀect on the
caloric curves in the experiments may come from the
dynamic process during the heavy ion collisions, which
still needs further investigation.
