This paper presents results of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS)
and global linear stability analyses (LSA) of a viscous incompressible ﬂow past a ﬁnite-
length cylinder with two free ﬂat ends. The cylindrical axis is normal to the streamwise
direction. The work focuses on the eﬀects of aspect ratios (in the range of 0.5 (cid:54) ar (cid:54) 2,
cylinder length over diameter) and Reynolds numbers (Re (cid:54) 1000 based on cylinder
diameter and uniform incoming velocity) on the onset of vortex shedding in this ﬂow.
All important ﬂow patterns have been identiﬁed and studied, especially as ar changes.
The appearance of a steady wake pattern when ar (cid:54) 1.75 has not been discussed earlier
in the literature for this ﬂow. LSA based on the time-mean ﬂow has been applied to
understand the Hopf bifurcation past which vortex shedding happens. The nonlinear
DNS results indicate that there are two vortex shedding patterns at diﬀerent Re, one
is transient and the other is nonlinearly saturated. The vortex-shedding frequencies of
these two ﬂow patterns correspond to the eigenfrequencies of the two global modes in
the stability analysis of the time-mean ﬂow. Wherever possible, we compare the results
of our analyses to those of the ﬂows past other short-ar bluﬀ bodies in order that our
discussions bear more general meanings.

Key words: bluﬀ-body wake ﬂow, ﬁnite-length cylinder, global linear stability analysis,

1. Introduction

Finite-length cylinders and their variants are ubiquitous in human lives and engineer-
ing, including the cylinder with one free end, e.g. chimneys, cylindrical tall buildings,
etc. and the cylinder with two free ends, e.g. submarine-like shape (Tezuka & Suzuki
2006; Sheard et al. 2008), torpedoes-like shape (Schouveiler & Provansal 2001), wheels
(Zdravkovich et al. 1989) and the short cylindrical bluﬀ bodies (Prosser & Smith 2016;
Yang et al. 2021) etc. However, compared to the extensively-studied ﬂow past an inﬁnite
cylinder, there are relatively fewer works on the ﬂow past a ﬁnite-length cylinder with
two free ends and thus the current understanding of the ﬂow dynamics past a ﬁnite-
length cylinder is insuﬃcient. The works on the ﬂows past ﬁnite-length cylinders in the
literature also appear scattered, mainly because of the many diﬀerent conﬁgurations that
are possible for the cylinder. For example, the cylinders can be classiﬁed as (1) having

two ﬂat free ends versus two non-ﬂat free ends; (2) having two free ends versus one free
end and one ﬁxed end (connected to a ground plane); (3) being axially perpendicular
to the incoming ﬂow versus axially parallel to the incoming ﬂow, etc. Plus, important
parameters, such as Reynolds number (Re), aspect ratio (ar), yaw angle, etc., are all
diﬀerent in each work, further enriching but at the same time complicating the current
literature. In this work, we will focus on the ﬂow past a cylinder with two free ends and
with an axis perpendicular to the incoming ﬂow with 0.5 (cid:54) ar (cid:54) 2 and Re (cid:54) 1000. In
the following, we will summarise the relevant works in the literature on the studies of the
ﬂows past a ﬁnite-length cylinder and on stability analyses based on a time-mean ﬂow.
At the end of this section, we will clarify the position of the current work by identifying
the research gap we are going to ﬁll.

1.1. Flows past a ﬁnite cylinder with two free ends

In an oil shadow experiment to visualise the ﬂow past a ﬁnite-length cylinder,
Zdravkovich et al. (1989) found that periodical vortices can be observed at the aspect
ratio of 2 < ar < 8 and 6 × 104 < Re < 2.6 × 105 (where ar = L/D with L being
the length or height and D the diameter of the cylinder), and when ar is reduced to 3,
the eye-like low pressure area near the free ends gradually disappears. Moreover, when
ar < 3, the pressure distribution on the curved surface is no longer symmetric about the
center plane, and this asymmetrical ﬂow produces yaw and roll moments. In general, the
drag coeﬃcient decreases as the aspect ratio decreases. However, Zdravkovich et al. (1989)
later conducted experiments on the ﬂow around a coin-like cylinder with 0 < ar (cid:54) 1 and
showed that in the range of 2 × 105 < Re < 6 × 105, the drag coeﬃcient and the aspect
ratio satisfy the relationship: C d = 0.024/ar + 0.633, (2 × 105 < Re < 6 × 105), that is
when ar decreases, C d increases. This trend contradicted their previous measurements
(in Zdravkovich et al. 1989) , which the authors attributed to the inappropriate reference
area used in this range of ar (once the side area D2
4 π was used as the reference area,
instead of the projected area LD, the previous trend that C d decreases as ar decreases
held valid for small values of ar). Furthermore, the topology of the ﬂow ﬁeld has also
been depicted: there are two horseshoe-shaped vortices on the two free ends, which are
separated at an angular position of approximately 90◦, and the free vortex forms two
counter-rotating vortex pairs in the leeward zone. Based on this observation, Zdravkovich
analysed and proposed a drag-reducing strategy of rounded sharp edges with a drag
reduction eﬀect up to 33.6%.

More recently, direct numerical simulations have been adopted in this ﬁeld of research;
for example, Inoue & Sakuragi (2008) studied the ﬂow around a ﬁnite cylinder with
two free ends with 0.5 (cid:54) ar (cid:54) 100 and 40 (cid:54) Re (cid:54) 300. Their results showed that
the ar and Re have a great inﬂuence on the vortex shedding pattern, and ﬁve types of
vortex shedding patterns were identiﬁed as: (I) Periodic oblique vortex shedding (large
ar, Re > Rec); (II) Quasi-periodic oblique vortex shedding (large ar, Re < Rec); (III)
Hairpin vortex that periodically falls oﬀ (moderate ar); (IV) Two stable counter-rotating
vortex pairs (small ar and Re); (V) The counter-rotating vortex pairs alternately shed
from the free ends (small ar, high Re). Prosser & Smith (2016) conducted large-eddy
simulations coupled with the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations using
a ﬁnite-volume method to study the ﬂow around bluﬀ bodies (ﬁnite cylinder or prism)
with much higher Re in the range of [105, 106] and ar = 1 and 2. The inﬂuences of the
geometric features and attitude of the bluﬀ body on the reattachment distance, pressure
coeﬃcient and stagnation point position were investigated and modelled empirically. For
example, they found that through proper normalisation, on the ﬂat ends of the bluﬀ body,

Onset of vortex shedding around a short cylinder

3

the pressure coeﬃcient and the stagnation point position are single-valued functions of the
incident angle; but on the curved face of the bluﬀ body, these two variables are aﬀected by
the aspect ratio. Gao et al. (2018) numerically studied the ﬂow pattern of a cylinder with
two free ends. Unlike the ﬂow ﬁeld of cylinder with one free end (where there is a large
horseshoe vortex surrounding the ﬁxed end of the cylinder), there is no horseshoe vortex
appears in the ﬂow past the cylinder with two free ends, and a new relationship between
C d and Re has been proposed within the range of 5 (cid:54) Re (cid:54) 5 × 106, 1 (cid:54) ar (cid:54) 6. In
addition, Pierson et al. (2019) used the ﬁnite-volume–ﬁctitious-domain method to study
the axial ﬂow (i.e. the cylinder axis is parallel to the streamwise direction) around a ﬁnite-
length three-dimensional cylinder (ar = 1, 20 < Re < 460) with two free ends. They
identiﬁed two bifurcation points both without hysteresis, one is the regular bifurcation
at Re ≈ 278 and the other is the Hopf bifurcation at Re ≈ 355. Unfortunately, they did
not explain how the aspect ratio aﬀects these two bifurcation points.

In addition, ﬁnite-length cylinders with non-ﬂat ends have also been studied by
some groups. These works are reviewed here because some of them are inspiring and
comparisons have been made to these works in our result section. Zdravkovich et al.
(1989), Schouveiler & Provansal (2001) and Sheard et al. (2005) used wind tunnel
experiment and numerical simulations respectively to study ﬂow around a ﬁnite cylinder
with two hemispherical ends. The results show that the hemispherical ends can eﬀectively
reduce drag coeﬃcient. Since the ﬂow ﬁeld past this type of cylinder has no ﬁxed
boundary layer (due to the rounded ends), there is no horseshoe vortex in ﬂow ﬁeld
either. When the two hemispherical ends connect each other, a sphere is formed. The
wake pattern, transition and instability of the ﬂow around a sphere have been studied for
a long time, especially, regarding the critical Reynolds number, beyond which the steady
ﬂow becomes unsteady. This critical Reynolds number has been reported as Rec = 130
in early experimental research (Taneda 1956), as Rec = 175 in LSA (Kim & Pearlstein
1990), as Rec = 270 in experiments of Magarvey & MacLatchy (1965); Wu & Faeth
(1993); Johnson & Patel (1999), as Rec = 277.5 in LSA of Natarajan & Acrivos (1993)
and ﬁnally as 270 < Rec < 285 in the DNS using the spectral element method by
Tomboulides & Orszag (2000). In summary, the value of Hopf bifurcation Rec = 277.5
obtained by LSA has been generally accepted. This is the second transition in the sphere
ﬂow; and the ﬁrst transition occurs around Re = 210 (Natarajan & Acrivos 1993) or
Re = 212 (Tomboulides & Orszag 2000). In this work, we will focus on the wake patterns
and transition of the ﬂow around a short ﬁnite cylinder (ar (cid:54) 2). As we will later show,
the ﬂow past a short ﬁnite-length cylinder (ar (cid:54) 1.7) shows a transition process similar
to that of a sphere, but also exhibits some unique characteristics.

1.2. Stability analyses of a mean ﬂow

As we will conduct global stability analysis of the ﬂow around the ﬁnite cylinder, it is
pertinent to review works on the application of this analysis to the inﬁnite-length cylinder,
pioneered by Jackson (1987); Zebib (1987); Noack & Eckelmann (1994). Especially, we
will review the stability analyses applied to the 2D wake ﬂows based on a time-mean
ﬂow.

For the wake ﬂow behind an inﬁnite-length (2D) cylinder, Hammond & Redekopp
(1997) and Pier (2002) noted that applying the linear stability analysis to the time-
averaged ﬂow ﬁeld (which will be called mean ﬂow for simplicity in the following) instead
of the steady base ﬂow, that is an unstable solution to the Navier–Stokes equations, can
better predict the shedding frequency of the unsteady ﬂow. Barkley (2006) conducted
a global LSA of the 2D cylinder ﬂow based on its mean ﬂow and observed that the
eigenfrequency is consistent with the nonlinear vortex shedding frequency St found by

4

Y. Yang, Z. Feng and M. Zhang

Williamson (1988) in his famous experiments of the cylinder ﬂow. In addition, Barkley
(2006) also showed that the mean ﬂow is marginally stable. This striking result was
explained in the asymptotic analysis by Sipp & Lebedev (2007) who demonstrated that
the two-dimensional cylinder ﬂow can be well represented by the mean ﬂow value and a
single eigenmode, and there is almost no nonlinear interaction between them, validating
the usage of the mean ﬂow in the stability analysis. Therefore, the premise of Barkley
(2006) for the global stability analysis of using the time-averaged ﬂow was veriﬁed, that is,
the Reynolds stress caused by the pulsating wake is not disturbed at the linear order. Sipp
& Lebedev (2007) also provided a theoretical proof for the validity of the global weakly
nonlinear analysis of the 2D cylinder ﬂow near the Hopf bifurcation. More speciﬁcally, the
theoretical conditions were given on how to keep the mean ﬂow linearly stable and when
the eigenfrequency obtained using the mean ﬂow matches the experimental frequency.
This condition can be qualitatively described as a situation where the zeroth harmonic
(mean ﬂow) is much stronger than the second harmonic. Meanwhile, they also pointed
out that the eﬀective results obtained in the case of the 2D cylinder based on the mean
ﬂow are by no means general (in the context of the ﬁnite-length cylinder whose axis is
perpendicular to the ﬂow direction, the stability analysis based on its mean ﬂow has not
been performed and will be conducted here). Besides, because of the weakly nonlinear
expansion employed in the theoretical development, the analysis of Sipp & Lebedev
(2007) is strictly valid only very close to the bifurcation point, and cannot fully explains
the success of Barkley (2006)’s global LSA performed on the mean ﬂow across a wide
range of Reynolds numbers.

Later, Leontini et al. (2010) applied the saddle-point criterion (that the zero group
velocity is found at the saddle point in the complex wavenumber plane or the cusp point
in the complex frequency plane when local mean ﬂows are analysed in the streamwise
direction) to spanwise-averaged three-dimensional inﬁnite cylinder ﬂow. Their results
showed that if the local curvature is not too large and the assumption of the ﬂow
changing slowly is valid, even if the ﬂow is three-dimensional, the saddle-point criterion
can work well. Their global LSA showed that even for the three-dimensional ﬂow, the
spanwise-averaged mean ﬂow remains marginally stable, which supports the following
hypothesis: the dynamics of the cylinder wake is mainly dominated by the ﬁrst linear
eigenmode generated on the nonlinear modiﬁed mean ﬂow. Turton et al. (2015) proved
in a more general manner that if the ﬂow exhibits quasi-monochromatic oscillations, the
eigenfrequency of the linearisation operator based on the temporally mean ﬂow is indeed
equal to the true nonlinear ﬂow frequency. They further looked into the amplitudes of the
waves in the spectral space of the signal and demonstrated that if the amplitude of the
ﬁrst harmonics is suﬃciently larger than those of higher-order harmonics, the stability
analysis based on the mean ﬂow can represent fairly well the dynamics of the nonlinear
ﬂow.

For a weakly non-parallel and strongly convectively unstable ﬂow, whose ﬁrst singular
value largely dominates the others, a strong link between the mean ﬂow and the fully
nonlinear dynamics of a turbulent ﬂow has been explained and veriﬁed by Beneddine et al.
(2016, 2017) from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. According to the RZIF
property (real zero imaginary frequency named by Turton et al. 2015), Bengana et al.
(2019) identiﬁed two successive Hopf bifurcations and classiﬁed three situations by using
mean ﬂow and base ﬂow LSA in the shear-driven cavity ﬂow and summarizing previous
research. Another interesting ﬁnding is that although no mathematical proof is given, the
cross-eigenvalues would then correspond to the relative stability of ﬁrst two eigenmodes,
which can good qualitatively explain the hysteresis in the nonlinear ﬂow system.

In summary, it can be concluded that the global LSA based on the mean ﬂow can

Onset of vortex shedding around a short cylinder

5

predict accurately the nonlinear frequency in a wider range of parameters for the quasi-
monochromatic oscillation ﬂows. It remains to be seen if this method is applicable to the
ﬂow to be studied here.

1.3. The current work

As we can see from the previous sections, there is no regular bifurcation (so-called
pitchfork) being reported in the previous research on 3D ﬁnite-length cylinder ﬂows with
ar > 2. It has not been studied systematically how this ﬂow bifurcates when ar < 2. On
the other hand, in the ﬂow around other bluﬀ bodies, many works have conﬁrmed the
existence of a regular bifurcation, such as sphere (Johnson & Patel 1999; Tomboulides &
Orszag 2000; Thompson et al. 2001; Sheard et al. 2004), axial ﬂow around short cylinders
with ar = 1 (Pierson et al. 2019) and ellipsoids (Sheard et al. 2008; Tezuka & Suzuki
2006). Thus, one can infer that the aspect ratio may be the decisive factor for educing the
regular bifurcation in the ﬁnite-length cylinder ﬂows and the regime ar (cid:54) 2 should be
explored to see if this bifurcation exists therein. In this work, we will study systematically
the inﬂuence of Re((cid:54) 1000) and ar ∈ [0.5, 2] on the ﬂow stability/instability of the ﬂow
past a 3D ﬁnite-length cylinder by nonlinear DNS and linear global LSA (mainly based
on temporal mean ﬂow). We will examine whether the LSA results obtained based on
the mean ﬂow can be compared to the nonlinear results in the DNS (e.g. in terms of the
shedding frequency in the ﬂow). Besides, in order to complete the discussions, we will
also compare the LSA results based on the mean ﬂow with the LSA results based on a
base ﬂow obtained using the selective frequency damping (SFD) method (˚Akervik et al.
2006). The most important result will be summarised in ﬁgure 21 on the Rec-ar relation.
The paper is organised as follows. § 2 introduces the conﬁguration of 3D ﬁnite cylinder
ﬂow, the boundary conditions, the governing equations, i.e. nonlinear Navier–Stokes
equations and their corresponding linearised equations about the base state (mean ﬂow
or base ﬂow) and the numerical method. § 3 provides a detailed veriﬁcation step of
nonlinear and linear numerical methods. In § 4, we show the results and discuss the base
states, cylinder wake patterns, critical Re, nonlinear DNS bifurcation scenario, global
eigenmodes and eﬀects of ar and Re on this ﬂow. Finally, the results are summarised in
§ 5 and conclusions are provided.

2. Problem formulation and numerical methods

2.1. Governing equations and geometry

We study the three-dimensional stability of the ﬂow around a ﬁnite-length cylinder
(of a length L and a diameter D) subjected to a uniform incoming ﬂow in a Cartesian
coordinate system. The computational domain size, boundary conditions and geometry
of the ﬁnite cylinder are shown in ﬁgure 1. The origin of the Cartesian coordinate system
is located at the center of the cylinder, the x axis points in the ﬂow direction, the z axis
extends along the center line of the cylinder, and the y axis is determined by the right-
hand rule. The axis of the cylinder is normal to the incoming ﬂow. The Navier–Stokes
(NS) equations for the unsteady incompressible ﬂow read

(2.1)

where U is the velocity vector, whose components corresponding to the three directions
of x, y, z are U = (Ux, Uy, Uz) and P is the pressure. In the equations 2.1, the cylinder
diameter D is used as the reference length, the velocity U∞ of the uniform incoming
ﬂow at inﬁnity as the reference velocity, and ρU 2
∞ as the reference pressure. Therefore,

where f is the frequency of vortex shedding (thus, when there is no vortex shedding in
the wake, St = 0), ν is the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid and ρ is the density. Fd is the
drag force on the surface of the cylinder, whose direction is the same as the streamwise
direction. Fl is the cross-stream lift force acting in either the y or z direction (see Cly
and Clz below). A is the reference area, and for a ﬁnite cylinder A = LD. For the lift
coeﬃcient Cl, there are two possibilities in y and z directions. Among them, Cly (in y
direction) is mainly discussed in present work, because its value is directly related to the
regular bifurcation. Clz (in z direction) or its mean is almost zero in most of the cases
due to the symmetry of the ﬂow. Besides, we will also use the letters C d and C l to denote
the time-averaged values of Cd and Cl.

Next, we deﬁne the boundary conditions in the computational domain. As shown in
ﬁgure 1(a), Sc represents the surfaces of the ﬁnite cylinder, on which no-slip boundary
conditions are applied

U = (Ux, Uy, Uz) = 0

on Sc.

domain, whose normal is in the x direction. The inlet boundary conditions for the velocity

Sxy,t, Sxy,b, Sxz,f and Sxz,b represent the surfaces of the cuboid on the top, bottom, front
and back side walls, which are parallel to the xy, xy, xz and xz planes, respectively.
Previous research indicates that the computation domain has some inﬂuence on the
results of the LSA. For example, Giannetti & Luchini (2007) conducted an eigenvalue
sensitivity analysis on the size of the computational domain in the problem of the
two-dimensional cylinder wake ﬂow with symmetric boundaries in the cross-streamwise
direction. Their results showed that when the size in the cross-streamwise direction is

Onset of vortex shedding around a short cylinder

greater than 10D, the drift of the eigenvalue and eigenmode is small. Following them,
we will perform a similar analysis. The symmetry boundary condition is imposed on the
surfaces Sxy,t, Sxy,b, Sxz,f and Sxz,b at position ±10D, that is Ly = Lz = 10:

(cid:40) ∂Ux

∂y = Uy = ∂Uz

∂z = Uz = ∂P

∂y = 0,

(2.6)

The values of Lx1, Lx2 deﬁne the position of the cylinder in the streamwise direction,
which, together with the vertical length Ly and span length Lz, will be discussed in a
convergence study of the computational domain size on the linear dynamics.

2.2. Linearisation

In the present work, we will study the global linear stability/instability of the ﬂows
around the ﬁnite-length cylinder. As we have reviewed in the introduction section, we
will focus on studying two types of base states (both of which are denoted as (Ub, Pb)
in the text to follow as long as there is no confusion) to analyse their global instability.
The ﬁrst base state is called a base ﬂow, which is a steady solution to the Navier–Stokes
equations 2.1 obtained by the selective frequency damping (SFD) method proposed by
˚Akervik et al. (2006). This method damps the unsteady temporal oscillations by adding
a dissipative relaxation term in the NS equations to let the low-frequency component of
the velocity pass. The second base state is the mean ﬂow, which is obtained by time-
averaging the periodic ﬂow with vortex shedding. For the present global stability analysis,
at least ten vortex shedding cycles will be used for the time-average procedure. The
linearisation starts with Reynolds’ decomposition U = Ub + u, P = Pb + p, which will be
substituted into the nonlinear governing equations. Then, we discard the nonlinear terms
and the terms satisfying the Navier–Stokes solution for the base states and retain terms
of the order of the perturbation, yielding the linearised equations for the inﬁnitesimal
perturbations residing on these base states

We found that the numerical results obtained by these boundary conditions in the eigen-
solver (to be discussed shortly) did not manifest the non-physical oscillations at outlet
boundary encountered by Giannetti & Luchini (2007). So, we did not set the partial
derivative of pressure in the streamwise to zero.

(2.10)

We expand the perturbation q in time q(x, y, z, t) = ˆq(x, y, z)eλt, where λ = σ + i2πω.
The equation 2.9 can be transformed into the following generalised eigenvalue problem
by substituting the solution ansatz of q:

λM ˆq = A ˆq

(2.11)

In this formulation, the stability of the base state Ub is dictated by the eigenvalues λ
in the linearised problem with ˆq being the eigenmode, σ temporal growth/decay rate of
perturbations and ω the eigenfrequency. Because the ﬂow problem is not spatially periodic
or homogeneous in either x, y, z directions, ˆq depends on all the three coordinates, giving
rise to a global stability problem (Theoﬁlis 2011) to be solved by the Arnoldi method. In
addition, the eigenfrequency ω of the ﬁrst eigenvalue also determines whether the base
state Ub experiences a regular bifurcation (ω = 0) or a Hopf bifurcation (ω > 0)(Bengana
et al. 2019).

2.3. Numerical methods: DNS and IRAM

In order to obtain the accurate wake pattern and base state of the fully three-
dimensional ﬂow past a ﬁnite-length cylinder at medium and low Reynolds numbers, we
conduct DNS of the ﬂow past the cylinder. The high-order parallelised open-source code
Nek5000 (Fischer et al. 2020) (version 19.0) is used, which is based on the nodal spectral
element method (SEM) originally proposed by Patera (1984). Hexahedral elements for a
polynomial order N = 7 (the optimal polynomial order suggested by Fischer et al. 2020)
are used to get a better performance of the code. The time step ∆t is determined by the
Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition with the target Courant number being in the
range of 0.5-1.0. In the following numerical simulations, the boundary layer elements have
been reﬁned by the O-type. To achieve the requirement of adequate resolution near the
surface of the cylinder, the value of the smallest boundary thickness for each Reynolds
number will be discussed in section 3.1.

For a non-parallel three-dimensional ﬂow past the ﬁnite cylinder, the numerical dis-
cretisation of linearised NS equation 2.7 will results in a large-scale Jacobian matrix A
in the generalised eigenvalue problem 2.11. It is often impractical to solve a large-scale
eigenvalue problem for its whole eigenspectrum in a 3D ﬂow. Based on Nek5000 solver
and the ARPACK package (Lehoucq et al. 1998), the matrix-free time-stepper method
(Theoﬁlis 2011; Doedel & Tuckerman 2012) is used in the present work. In this method,
one does not need to explicitly construct the matrices, but instead power-iterate the
linearised NS equations 2.7 in the temporal direction from an initial condition u0. In
the long-time limit, the power iteration will converge to the asymptotic state of the
linearised system, that is, the least stable/most unstable eigenmode of Eq. 2.11. More
eigen-information cannot be extracted from the simple power method. To remedy this, the
classical Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM) (Radke 1996; Lehoucq et al. 1998)
based on Krylov subspaces will be used to reduce the order of the original matrix, forming
the much smaller Hessenberg matrix, to obtain the Ritz eigenmodes approximating the
leading eigenmodes of the full system.

3. Validation

3.1. Validation of nonlinear DNS

In this section, we will ﬁrst show the evidence of converged calculations using Nek5000
and explain the choice of the grid resolution. Eight sets of grids from G1 to G8 in table
1 have been used to analyse the inﬂuence of spatial resolution on the DNS results at
Re = 300 and ar = 1. The coeﬃcients C d and C ly and the St number are used as
evaluation indicators. Nx1 and Nx2 are the numbers of the nodes in x direction as shown
in the right panel of ﬁgure 1(b); Ny and Nz are the node numbers for the sections related
to Ly and Lz, respectively. As previously mentioned, the polynomial order N = 7 for
all Re, which means that the number of the Gauss–Legendre–Lobatto nodes inside each
hexahedral element is 8 × 8 × 8 (in 3 directions). Since the ﬂow in the boundary layer of
cylinder is sheared most, we tested the layer number of the O-type mesh Nb = 2, 4, 6, 8,
while keeping the total thickness of the O-type mesh constant. We can see from table
1 that, comparing G5-G7, when Nb (cid:62) 6, the errors in C d and C ly are generally small.
The error in St (which appears more sensitive to the grid number) is also less than
1%. The corresponding smallest boundary layer grid thickness is approximately 0.003 (a
dimensionless value with the diameter D as the reference length), which is smaller than
the estimated value of 0.016 for Re = 1000 in Tomboulides & Orszag (2000) who also
used the SEM. Next, keeping the parameters of the boundary layer mesh unchanged,
we test the eﬀect of the element size in the wake area on the results. Comparing cases
G4, G6 and G8, we can see that if (Nx1 + Nx2) × Ny × Nz (cid:62) (6 + 10) × 6 × 6, the

10−3. The errors are computed using as a reference the results of the mesh S3.

diﬀerences in C d, C ly, St among G4, G6 & G8 are also very small. Besides comparing
cases G4 and Inoue & Sakuragi (2008)’s DNS at ar = 1, Re = 300, the diﬀerence of
C d is approximately 0.53%; but the diﬀerence in St is 10.5% (our St = 0.142 in table 3
using mesh S2 and the DNS results in Inoue & Sakuragi (2008) is St = 0.127), and the
reasons for this large diﬀerence will be discussed in Sec. 4.3 to follow. Furthermore, as
the Re = 300 in Table 1 is relatively low, we have also tested the cases with Re = 1000
using the meshes G4 and G8 for a turbulent wake ﬂow. In this case, the time histories
of Cd and Cly are intermittent. We compare the averaged values of theirs within 400
dimensionless time units. As shown in table 2, the diﬀerence in C d between the two grids
is small and the values of C ly by themselves are also small, close to zero. The latter is
because the ﬂow is turbulent and statistically, there is not a preferred direction of the
lift force in y. With these results, we decided to use mesh G4 for Re (cid:54) 500, mesh G8 for
500 (cid:54) Re (cid:54) 1000 in our numerical simulations.

Next, we deal with the size of the computational domain for G4. As mentioned
previously (§ 2.1), the numerical structural stability analysis (Giannetti & Luchini 2007)
of the ﬂow around a two-dimensional cylinder indicates that the results of the stability
analysis will change signiﬁcantly if the computational domain is not suﬃciently large
and its boundaries are placed close to the ﬂow core area. For a two-dimensional cylinder,
the core area is the recirculation zone near the cylinder. In table 3, we tested four
computational sizes for the G4 grid. The blockage ratios (= A/Sin) for S0, S1, S2 and S3
are 4%, 1%, 0.25% and 0.098%, respectively. In order to ensure that the spatial resolution
remains relatively the same, the element number outside the O-type mesh zone of mesh
S3 increases accordingly with the increase of computational domain size, so its Ntotal is
slightly larger. We set the results of the S3 case as the reference. It can be seen that
when the blockage ratio is less than 1%, the diﬀerences in time-averaged drag and lift
coeﬃcients are less than 2%, and St is relatively more sensitive. For the blocking ratio
less than 0.25%, the diﬀerences in C d, C ly, St are less than 0.6%. Meanwhile, we also
tested the inﬂuence of the computational domain size on the eigenvalue solution based
on the mean ﬂow. The eﬀect of the computational domain size on the eigenfrequency ω
is similar to that on the St number. On the other hand, the eﬀect of the computational
domain size on the growth rate is stronger than the eigenfrequency. This is because when

Onset of vortex shedding around a short cylinder

11

Re is greater than the critical Reynolds number, the linear stability results based on
the mean ﬂow are marginally stable (meaning that the growth rate is nearly zero), so
any inﬂuence of the computational domain size on the growth rate will appear relatively
large. These tests are consistent with the numerical tests in Giannetti & Luchini (2007),
whose results indicated that if the boundaries are not placed close to the core zone of
instability, one can get reasonable eigenvalues.

After the numerical veriﬁcation step, in the result section, we will use a computational
domain for the case of ar = 1 with a blocking ratio of 0.25%. For other ar values
of the cylinder ﬂow, the computational domain size is increased accordingly to keep
the blocking ratio no greater than 0.375%. For the cases with the same ar, when Re
increases, the computational domain size remains unchanged. In this way, the eﬀect
of the computational domain size on the growth/decay rate σ is ﬁxed to analyse the
inﬂuence of Re on σ.

3.2. Global stability analysis and validation

In this section, we will show the global stability analyses of the ﬂow around the ﬁnite-
length cylinder. Since in the present literature, we are not able to ﬁnd the global LSA
results of the fully 3D ﬂow around a short cylinder with two free ends, we will validate our
implementation of the global stability code in the 2D cylinder ﬂow. The Reynolds number
range being explored is 35 (cid:54) Re (cid:54) 500 (Re here is also based on the cylinder’s diameter
D). In ﬁgures 2(a, b), we compare the real part of the leading eigenmode (in the form of
vorticity) by the present linear stability analysis based on the time-mean ﬂow with the
leading eigenmode calculated by Barkley (2006). The two results are visually the same.
In ﬁgures 2(c, d), we further compare the leading eigenfrequency and the growth rate
(by both base ﬂow and mean ﬂow) from our IRAM code with the St results and growth
rates obtained by previous stability analysis (Barkley 2006), DNS (Leontini et al. 2010)
and experiment (Williamson 1989) as function of Re. One can see a good agreement of
our results with theirs.

In the inﬁnite cylinder wake ﬂow, there are two critical values of Re: one is around 46,
across which the ﬂow undergoes a Hopf bifurcation giving rise to the 2D vortex shedding
and the other is approximately 180, across which the St-Re curve shows discontinuity
(Williamson 1989), which is due to the three-dimensional nature of the wake ﬂow.
Comparing the results in ﬁgure 2 regarding the critical Reynolds number, one can see
that when Re < 46.1, the eigenvalues obtained using the base ﬂow and the mean ﬂow
are the same. This means that for the physical ﬂows without oscillation or with decaying
oscillation, stability analysis based on the base ﬂow or the mean ﬂow will yield the same
result, which also veriﬁes our implementation of the two methods (one is SFD-based
LSA and the other is time-average DNS results). When 46.1 < Re < 180, we can observe
that stability analysis based on the mean ﬂow can reproduce the experimental results
but that based on the SFD base ﬂow cannot, which has been observed and discussed
in detail by Pier (2002); Barkley (2006) among many others. When Re > 180, the
result of LSA can no longer reﬂect the true vortex shedding frequency in the experiment
(Williamson 1989), but its eigenfrequency is still close to the vortex shedding frequency
obtained by the two-dimensional DNS (Leontini et al. 2010). As previously mentioned,
the discontinuous change of the St number is caused by the three-dimensional nature
of the wake, so two-dimensional DNS and LSA are no longer suitable for predicting the
vortex shedding frequency in experiments (dot-dashed lines) when Re > 180.

As a further validation step of the three-dimensional results, we use the power method
to solve the linear equation 2.7 (linearised around the mean ﬂow), then compare its growth
rate and frequency with the leading eigenvalue obtained by IRAM. The power method

can yield the eigenvalue of the largest absolute amplitude of a matrix, provided it is well
separated from the second one. As shown in ﬁgure 3(a), the leading eigenvalues obtained
by power method and IRAM are very close to each other at ar = 1, 270 < Re < 350.
In ﬁgure 3(b), the growth rates at diﬀerent Re are obtained by the linear interpolation
of the DNS results, the power method and the IRAM. The value of the critical Rec1
obtained by the linear interpolation (of the DNS results) is almost the same as that
determined by the IRAM, which are 172.2 and 171.4 respectively (the diﬀerence between

them is 0.46%). For the cases far away from Rec1, the growth rates obtained by these
two methods appear diﬀerent (due to the nonlinearity). The critical Reynolds numbers
Rec2 obtained by the power method and the IRAM are also close to each other.

4. Result and discussions

In this section, we will present detailed results of global stability analysis and DNS of
the ﬂows past a ﬁnite-length cylinder. We will show the base states in nonlinear system in
the range of Re (cid:54) 1000 and ar (cid:54) 2, which is characterised by time-averaged aerodynamic
coeﬃcients (i.e. Cd, Cl etc.). We then study the ﬂow transitions from steady wake pattern
P1 to chaotic pattern P4 (see Sec. 4.2) for ar = 1. This is followed by a discussion of
the global modes and how they are connected to the monochromatic ﬂow patterns P3. In
the end, we will discuss the eﬀect of ar with the signiﬁcance of our results summarised
in ﬁgure 21.

4.1. Base states in nonlinear system

In this section, we will show the results of the nonlinear DNS for the ﬂow around the
ﬁnite-length cylinder. First, we observe that with the increase of Re, the wake pattern
will change, which is reﬂected in the structure of the mean ﬂow ﬁeld. The drag and lift
coeﬃcients in the mean ﬂow are shown in ﬁgure 4. We can ﬁt the relation between C d and
the Reynolds number for the ar values considered in ﬁgure 4(a) using the power function
C d = aReb + c. The ﬁtting coeﬃcients (a, b, c) are shown in the legend of ﬁgure 4(a).
The goodness of ﬁt R2 for each ar is greater than 0.99. On the other hand, for the lift
coeﬃcient, the change in wake pattern has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on C ly as shown in ﬁgure
4(b). For example, at ar = 1, each change in the wake pattern by increasing Re will cause
discontinuity or kinks in C ly, as shown at Re = 172, 282 and 550. These discontinuous
or non-smoothness positions correspond to bifurcation points, as we will explain in the
following global linear stability analyses.

Comparing the values of C ly of ar = 0.5, 0.75, 1 & 1.5, we can observe that when
ar becomes larger, the value of Re at which C ly becomes non-zero decreases. For these
ar values, C ly decreases to a negative value from zero and then increases and return
to zero. This trend of the C ly result with increasing Re indicates that there is a spatial
asymmetry generated in the ﬂow evolving from the laminar solution when Re becomes
larger and this asymmetry disappears (so Cly → 0) when Re becomes even larger. At the
onset of non-zero C ly, the gradient of C ly is quite steep, signalling a sudden transition
of the ﬂow states. On the other hand, when ar becomes large, the C ly results look very
diﬀerent: we can see from the panel b that when ar is large (e.g. ar = 2), the value
of C ly is always approximately zero for Re from 0 to 300 as we investigated here, in
which region we can ﬁnd non-zero values of C ly for small-ar ﬂows. This means that the
value of ar is fundamentally important in determining the dynamics of the ﬂow past a
ﬁnite-length cylinder. We have also superposed the results of sphere (Johnson & Patel
1999) and interestingly, we ﬁnd that the C ly result of ar = 0.75 in our ﬂow is very close
to that of the sphere. Besides, this similarity also exists in the characteristic size of the
separation bubble as shown in ﬁgure 6(a). Thus, it is reasonable to believe that the ﬁnite
cylinder with a small ar may behave dynamically similarly to the sphere. As a side note,
Inoue & Sakuragi (2008) did not report the non-zero value of C ly in their DNS results,
but this phenomenon exists in our results and has also been conﬁrmed in the ﬂow past a
sphere (Johnson & Patel 1999; Tomboulides & Orszag 2000) and axial ﬂow past a short
cylinder (Pierson et al. 2019).

4.2. Flows past a ﬁnite cylinder at ar = 1
The main parameters in this work are Re and ar. In order to give a clear presentation
of our results, in this section, we will mainly use the case ar = 1 as a prototype. In
subsection 4.4, we will present the eﬀect of changing ar.

4.2.1. Steady ﬂows

First, let us discuss the steady ﬂows that one can obtain at diﬀerent values of Re. For
the cylinder with ar = 1 and Re being larger than approximately 10, the ﬂow begins to
separate on the ends of the cylinder, a closed recirculation zone begins to form, and a
pair of counter-rotating vortices appear in the wake. At this time, there are two mutually
perpendicular symmetric planes (x-y and x-z passing through the origin of the coordinate
system) in the wake, and the centroid of the cylinder is on these two planes. We call this
ﬂow pattern P1. The corresponding Reynolds number at the onset of pattern P1 is Rec0.
In general, the ar is inversely correlated with Rec0. The smaller ar is, the closer Rec0
is to 20 in the case of the sphere wake (Johnson & Patel 1999), and the larger ar is,
the closer Rec0 is to 4 in the case of inﬁnite-length 2D cylinder ﬂow. Speciﬁcally, the
critical Reynolds numbers of the ﬁnite cylinder with ar = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5 and 2 are
Rec0 ≈ 18, 15, 10, 8 and 6, respectively.

to each other, at Re = 100 and ar = 1. (a) streamlines on plane x-y, (b) streamlines on
x-z plane.

A streamline diagram is used to characterise the typical wake structure of the pattern
P1 for ar = 1 and Re = 100 in ﬁgure 5. The speciﬁc cross-section is the x-y and x-z
planes of the ﬂow. Unless stated otherwise, the streamwise direction of the ﬂow ﬁeld
diagram in this article is from left to right. The topological traits of the pattern P1, such
as the separation position on the cylinder’s end (θs), the vortex center point (xb, yb) or
(xb, zb) and the length of the separation bubble (xs), have also been shown in ﬁgure 5.
The ﬂuid separates from the cylinder’s end at the angle θs (the vertex of the angle is at
the origin, one edge ends at the forward stagnation point, and the other at the separation
point), and converges at a point xs on the ox axis, forming a closed separation bubble
in the x-z plane. The coordinates of the center of the separation vortex pair in the x-y
and x-z planes are (xb, yb) and (xb, zb), respectively, and the velocity at the vortex center
point (xb, yb, zb) is zero. All the lengths are non-dimensionalised by the cylinder diameter.
With these parameters, we can quantify the eﬀect of Re on the pattern P1, as follows.

Previous works on ﬂow past a sphere (Fornberg 1988; Johnson & Patel 1999;
Tomboulides & Orszag 2000) found and conﬁrmed that when Re > 75, the separation
angle and the separation bubble length are logarithmically related to the Reynolds
number. Following this idea, we found that a logarithmic relation also holds in the ﬂow
past short cylinders, as illustrated in ﬁgure 6. For the steady ﬂow, the separation bubble
length can be approximately related to Re by xs = a ln(Re + b) + c (see the dotted curves
in panel (a) and for the unsteady ﬂow, the separation angle and separation bubble length
are measured in the mean ﬂow). The goodness of ﬁt R2 for ar = 1 is 0.9988, and exceeds
0.999 for the other four cylinders. The turning points of curve xs-Re in ﬁgure 6(a)
correspond to the transition of wake mode (from steady ﬂows to time-periodic ﬂows),
which also can be observed in C ly-Re (ﬁgure 4b). One can see that the xs-Re relation
curve for the ﬂow past a sphere is close to the ar = 0.75 data. As pointed out by one of
the referees, this aspect ratio is notable because, interestingly, it has a projected frontal
area that is very close to that of a sphere (i.e. π/4 ≈ 0.785), which can also explains
that the curve C ly-Re (ar = 0.75) in (ﬁgure 4b) almost coincides with that of sphere.

In ﬁgure 6(b), the relationship between the separation angle and the Reynolds number
is approximately a power function θs = aReb + c within the range of Re < 600. It
turns out that the separation angle is less sensitive to the transition, and almost no
visible kinks are found in these results. At a ﬁrst glance, the results of the sphere from
Johnson & Patel (1999) deviate signiﬁcantly from the result of ar = 0.75 (note that
these results in ﬁgure 6(b) is only for θs in the x-y plane). A more fair comparison entails
an additional consideration of the separation angle in the x-z plane. With reference to
ﬁgure 5(b) (plane x-z), the separation angles at the sharp trailing corners of the short

cylinder are ﬁxed at 135◦ (ar = 1), 143.13◦ (ar = 0.75) and 153.44◦ (ar = 0.5). Hence,
we can simply average the two angles in the x-z and x-y planes and plot the new results
as dashed lines in ﬁgure 6(b). One can see that in this case, the results of short cylinders
(for ar = 0.5, 0.75, 1) indeed straddle that of the sphere, consistent with the previous
simple argument as suggested by the referee.

the legends. In panel (b), the black, red and green dashed lines are the averaged value of
the separation angles in the x-y and x-z planes for the short cylinders with ar = 0.5, 0.75
and 1, respectively.

When Re further increases, larger than a certain critical Rec1, the current DNS results
show that the pattern P1 will be unstable and transition to another steady wake pattern
P2 (ﬁgure 7) with only one symmetrical plane (x-y), simultaneously inducing non-zero
values of C ly. The bifurcation of the short cylinder at Rec1 is steady, time-independent
without vortex shedding (St = 0), so the ﬂow experiences a pitchfork bifurcation. It
is noted that the pattern P2 may not appear for certain values of ar. As we will
show in the end of next section, ar = 1.75 is such an example. We will present more
systematic results of the eﬀect of ar in Sec. 4.4. This is similar to the ﬂow past a
sphere, where there is a regular bifurcation before the Hopf bifurcation. The diﬀerence is
that the wake of the sphere retains a symmetric plane that is randomly oriented, which
can be related to the numerical uncertainty or the perturbations in the experimental
environment (Tomboulides & Orszag 2000). In the literature, there is no discussion about
the P2-type ﬂow pattern (Inoue & Sakuragi 2008 did not report this) or its associated
regular bifurcation for the ﬂow past a short cylinder with its axis being perpendicular
to the streamwise direction (in the following, for the ease of discussion, we will call this
ﬂow a radial ﬂow; likewise, we call the ﬂow past a short cylinder with its axis parallel
to the streamwise direction an axial ﬂow). Recently, Pierson et al. (2019) conducted a
numerical simulation of an axial ﬂow past a short cylinder at ar = 1, 20 (cid:54) Re (cid:54) 420 and
ar = 3, 25 (cid:54) Re (cid:54) 250. They found a regular bifurcation for the axial ﬂow around the
cylinder at ar = 1 and Re ≈ 278 (based on the cylinder diameter) without hysteresis,
but this bifurcation was not found for the cylinder with ar = 3. Sheard et al. (2008)

body cube have been numerically studied by Saha (2004). The cube wake also undergoes
a regular bifurcation (losing one symmetric plane but retaining time-independence) at
Re = 216 and a Hopf bifurcation at Re = 270. From these works, it can be hypothesised
that the aspect ratio ar of the bluﬀ body (including the short cylinder with ﬂat ends as
we study here) is related to the existence of a regular bifurcation.

Now we present the way we determine Rec1. We perform nonlinear DNS for ar = 1, and
the critical value Rec1 is approached by gradually increasing the Reynolds number from
a small value. For each Re, we can calculate the growth rate of disturbance development
as in ﬁgure 8. In this paragraph, we focus on the blue curves for Re = 180 without
randomness in the initial condition and will discuss the other curves shortly. The time
series of Cly, when plotted in a logarithmic scale against the time in a linear scale (as
in panel b), will display a period of a straight line, which represents the linear phase.
The linear growth or decay rate can then be calculated and the critical Re corresponding
to the zero growth rate can be interpolated by ﬁtting several data points using a linear
function, which is shown in ﬁgure 10, to be discussed shortly. For ar=1, we can see
that Rec1 = 172.2, which is consistent with the Re of onset of non-zero C ly shown in
ﬁgure 4(b). The Rec1 values of other ar have also been calculated and it is found that
when ar is small or large, Rec1 is relatively large. The ar having the minimum Rec1
is approximately located around 1.25 ∼ 1.5. Besides, the ar-dependence of the critical
Reynolds number will be revealed in Sec. 4.4. In the analysis of Tomboulides & Orszag
(2000), the authors also performed a logarithmic transformation of the azimuthal velocity
at a point located in the wake and near the sphere, and found that the logarithm of the
azimuthal velocity is a linear function of time during the initial evolution. The growth
rate obtained by this method is consistent with the LSA result of Natarajan & Acrivos
(1993).

Some numerical experiments have also been conducted to perturb the ﬂows in ﬁgure 8.
We applied white noise (denoted as (cid:15)rand) to the initial conditions in the DNS at
ar = 1, Re = 165, 168, 170 (subcritical, as Re < Rec1 = 172.2). The random numbers
are shifted to perturb the solution positively and negatively. The amplitude of the white
noise is 0.2 times the inlet velocity for the three cases and additionally, for Re = 168, we
also examined the amplitudes of the (white-noise) disturbance being 0 and 0.6 times the
inlet velocity. The white noise is applied to all the three velocity components through
the following initial conditions (Eq. 4.1 and Eq. 4.2).

random numbers between -1 and 1 in Eq. 4.2. x, y, z are the coordinate values of the
element nodes. ix, iy, iz, ig are the numbers of the element nodes. From ﬁgure 8, we can
see that the lift coeﬃcients Cly for all the cases aforementioned eventually converge to
zero (because the ﬂows are subcritical) and the linear phase survives for a long time. This
demonstrates the robustness of the results. A by-product of these numerical experiments
is that they seem to indicate that the ﬁrst bifurcation of the short cylinder around Rec1
is probably supercritical for the parameters we consider here, because if the bifurcation
was subcritical, the white noise with a large amplitude will probably bring the ﬂow to
a stable ﬁnite-amplitude nonlinear solution. In order to conﬁrm the supercriticality of
the ﬁrst bifurcation in this ﬂow, we estimate the coeﬃcients of the Landau model from
the DNS data (as is well known, the Landau coeﬃcient calculated around the linear
critical conditions determines the nature of the bifurcation, see Guckenheimer & Holmes

number. Unstable ﬂows will transition from P1 pattern to P2 pattern via a regular
bifurcation and the critical Reynolds number is Rec1.

(1983)). The global variable Cly that can directly reﬂect the transition from P1 to P2
is used to evaluate the Landau coeﬃcient at Re = 180 and ar = 1. The original time
history of Cly is shown in ﬁgure 8(a), where |Cly| grows and ﬁnally saturates. Now, based
on Landau equation dA
dt = c1 A + c3 |A|2 (where A can be viewed as the amplitude of
Cly) or, equivalently, dlog|A|/dt = c1 + c3 |A|2 , the Landau coeﬃcients c1 and c3 can be
calculated by plotting d(log|Cly |)/dt versus |Cly|2 (Thompson et al. 2001), as shown in
ﬁgure 9. Therefore, the vertical intercept point gives an estimation of c1 = 0.0201 and
the gradient near this point is an approximation of c3 = −8.78. The value of growth rate
c1 = 0.0201 is close to the linear growth rate 0.0196 (at Re = 180) obtained by calculating
the linear slope in ﬁgure 8(b). Furthermore, the negative c3 = −8.78 indicates that the
(lowest-order) nonlinearity stabilises the ﬂow. In panel (b), one can also see that the
nonlinearity stabilises the ﬂow after the linear regime. Thus the bifurcation is supercritical
transitioning from P1 to P2. We mention in passing that, theoretically, using this method
to infer the bifurcation type of a ﬂow is most accurate when the parameter is close to
the critical condition. Nevertheless, when this is satisﬁed, the evolution time of the ﬂow
is very long in DNS. As long as the bifurcation type is concerned, the method can be
applied slightly away from the critical condition (Henderson & Barkley 1996; Gao et al.
2013; Carmo et al. 2010; Feng et al. 2021). Besides, we arrive at the above conclusion
using only one instance of Re and admit that a more rigorous analysis would be to apply
the weakly nonlinear stability analysis around the linear critical conditions, which can
be pursued in a future work.

To sum up, the P2-type steady ﬂow has been found for short cylinders with small
ar. Most of the relevant research on the ﬂow past a short bluﬀ body have focused on
the sphere or cylinder with a large ar, and no previous studies have systematically
investigated this P2-type wake mode in the axial ﬂow past a ﬁnite cylinder. Through our
DNS results in the range of 0.5 < ar < 2, it is found that the ar of the short cylinder
has a very signiﬁcant and important inﬂuence on the critical Reynolds number Rec1.
Only when the ar is relatively small (ar < 1.75) will there be a regular bifurcation.
As can be seen in ﬁgure 10, when ar = 1.75, we cannot ﬁnd the regular transition by
either DNS or LSA methods. In fact, when ar (cid:38) 1.75, as Re increases, the wake of the
radial ﬂow around the short cylinder will not experience the P2-type wake, and directly
transition from the P1-type to a periodic shedding of hairpin-shaped vortices P3-0 with

C ly = C lz = 0, which has been reported many times in the ﬂow past a bluﬀ body with
ar > 2, for example, in the ﬂow past a cylinder with two free hemispherical ends (Sheard
et al. 2005, 2008), a cylinder with two free ﬂat ends at moderate 2 (cid:54) ar (cid:54) 10 (named
type III by Inoue & Sakuragi 2008) and at ar = 3 and Re > 125 (Pierson et al. 2019’s
ﬁgure 29), a prolate spheroid at L/D = 6 and Re = 100 (El Khoury et al. 2012) and a
freely falling cylinder following rectilinear paths at Archimedes number Ar = 200 and
L/D = 5 (Toupoint et al. 2019’s ﬁgure 17a). Nevertheless, we will report in the next
section that there are two unreported periodic vortex shedding wakes (P3-1 and P3-2)
of radial ﬂow around the short cylinder with C ly (cid:54)= 0.

4.2.2. Vortex shedding

When Re increases further, a second bifurcation appears at Re ≈ 282 (for ar = 1) with
St (cid:54)= 0, which belongs to a Hopf bifurcation. Figure 11 shows the relationship between
the linear growth rate and Re for short cylinders of diﬀerent ar values from 0.5 to 2 near
the Hopf bifurcation point. The relationship between the growth rate and the Reynolds
number is approximately linear when the ﬂow is stable and near the critical condition.
The solid lines in ﬁgure 11 represent linear ﬁtting results which are shown in the legend.
The general trend is that the larger the value of ar is, the smaller the critical value of
Rec2. The denoted eigenmodes A and B will be discussed in Sec. 4.3.

We found that near the Hopf bifurcation point, one of the two periodic wake patterns
P3-1 (a transitional state) or P3-2 (a saturated state) may appear and can exist for a
long time. The P3-1 wake pattern is a hairpin-like vortex structure shedding from the
side surface of the cylinder, as shown in ﬁgure 12(a). The P3-1 type wake is symmetric
about the x-y plane (note that the green ruler is collinear with the cylinder axis, that is
z), and the lift coeﬃcient Clz in the z direction is non-oscillating and approximately zero.
Fast Fourier transform (FFT) applied to the drag and the lift coeﬃcients gives the same
and single-periodic vortex shedding frequency StRe=283 = 0.125. Interestingly, we notice
that this value is comparable to the vortex frequency of the sphere StRe=270 = 0.1292,
StRe=285 = 0.1335 obtained by Tomboulides & Orszag (2000) through nonlinear DNS.
The cross-section of the P3-1 hairpin vortex on the x-y plane is asymmetric with respect
to x axis, and the wake is oﬀset in the y axis (similar to the P2 type wake). This
asymmetric periodic wake pattern is also similar to the asymmetric wakes of bluﬀ bodies,

the legends indicates that the initial condition for the velocity is (1,0,0) plus white noise
with an amplitude of a. The white noise is three-dimensional as seen in Eq. 4.2.

for example, in the axial ﬂow around a short cylinder studied by Pierson et al. (2019) (who
found that the axial ﬂow becomes unsteady at Re ≈ 355, ar = 1, but it still maintains
a symmetric plane in wake until Re = 420), in the ﬂow past a sphere by Tomboulides
& Orszag (2000); Johnson & Patel (1999) (who showed that the regular bifurcation at
Re = 211, and the asymmetric steady ﬂow becomes unsteady at Re = 275), and in the
ﬂow past a short cylinder with hemispherical ends by Sheard et al. (2008) (who found
that the regular bifurcation at Re = 350 ± 2). The other three-dimensional wake pattern
P3-2 is shown in ﬁgure 12(b). It can be seen that the vortex shedding from the ends
begins to be dominant in the wake. The results of FFT applied on the aerodynamic
coeﬃcients show that the frequency of Cd and Cly is the same, and the frequency of Clz
is 1/2 that of Cd and Cly. Besides, the frequency of vortex shedding of the structure P3-2
is larger than that of the structure P3-1; for example at Re = 290, we calculated that
StP 3−2 = 0.1395 whereas StP 3−1 = 0.1269. More results of the St data for other values
of Re are shown in ﬁgure 19 to be discussed shortly.

In a subcritical ﬂow (with Re < 282 for ar = 1), both P3-1 and P3-2 patterns are
stable and will converge to the P2 pattern. This is demonstrated in ﬁgure 13 using DNS
where we have used diﬀerent initial conditions to trigger the appearance of the two P3
patterns. We found that if one uses initial perturbation with a smaller amplitude at
Re = 278, the ﬂow will more likely develop to the P3-1 structure; whereas, if a large
disturbance is adopted, P3-2 is more likely to appear. To explain, the initial condition is

the base ﬂow (Ux, Uy, Uz), e.g. (1, 0, 0), plus white noise with a maximum amplitude of
a = 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, denoted as 1+a(cid:15)rand. Let us ﬁrst claim the results that 1+a(cid:15)rand leads to
the P3-1 structure, and 3 + 0.2(cid:15)rand gives rise to the P3-2 structure. The phase trajectory
diagram of the lift-drag coeﬃcient is shown in ﬁgure 13. For all the initial conditions
considered, the Cd-Cly curves of P3-1 and P3-2 patterns, as converging spirals, shrink to
the same ﬁxed point, that is, the attractor of the subcritical cases is a ﬁxed point, which
is the steady ﬂow pattern P2 as shown in ﬁgure 7. On the other hand, the oscillation
range of Clz corresponding to the initial conditions 1 + a(cid:15)rand is much smaller than Cly
and is close to zero, as shown in ﬁgure 13(b). Based on this result, we think that the
initial conditions 1 + a(cid:15)rand leads to the P3-1 pattern. The phase trajectory of Cd-Clz
corresponding to the initial condition 3 + 0.2(cid:15)rand is obviously diﬀerent from that of
1 + a(cid:15)rand (the P3-1 pattern) and corresponds to the P3-2 structure.

In a supercritical ﬂow (with Re > 282 for ar = 1), the P3-1 pattern is transient and
will eventually converge to the saturated P3-2 pattern. However, one may be easily fooled
to believe that the P3-1 pattern can be a stable mode because when Re is close to the
critical condition, the lingering time of the ﬂow around the neighbourhood of P3-1 can
be extremely long (before it saturates to the nonlinearly stable P3-2 state). This is shown
in ﬁgures 14 and 15 for Re = 290 and 300, respectively. As one can see from ﬁgure 15
for Re = 300, the two wake patterns and their transition are clear in a relatively short
time. When Re = 290, however, the DNS method becomes quite diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate
the two because one needs to simulate for a very long time to see the transition. In the
above two ﬁgures, because a high-Re is more sensitive to numerical error, it makes the
Re = 300 ﬂow transition to the saturated state more quickly. Another way to expedite
the convergence to the saturated state is to add perturbation in the initial condition,

resulting in a high possibility of throwing the ﬂow out of the neighbourhood of P3-1 and
converging to the ﬁnal saturated state more quickly (results not shown).

Some discussions are in order regarding the possible bifurcation type around Rec2. In
the subcritical ﬂows, our numerical simulations with diﬀerent initial conditions cannot
converge to a stable ﬂow state other than P2 (which is a linearly stable state). In the
supercritical ﬂows, even though the lingering time around P3-1 can be very long, the ﬁnal
saturation of the ﬂow is the P3-2 pattern; diﬀerent initial conditions will only change
the time spent by the ﬂow around P3-1 before converging to the P3-2 wake. With these
results, we infer that the nature of the bifurcation around Rec2 should be supercritical.
The Landau model has also been used to study the bifurcation type (following a similar
analysis presented in ﬁgure 9). Again, c1 = 0.0272 obtained in the Landau model is
close to the global stability analysis results based on the SFD base ﬂow (whose linear
growth rate is 0.02746). The negative value of c3 indicates that the ﬂow bifurcation may
be supercritical, which can also been seen in the stabilising eﬀect of the (lowest-order)
nonlinearity in ﬁgure 16(b). More analyses of the P3-1 and P3-2 patterns and the ﬂow
bifurcation will be conducted in section 4.3 on the global modes.

4.2.3. Approach to chaos

When Re is further increased, the ﬂow becomes more chaotic. Figure 17 shows Cd-Clz
phase diagrams and power spectral density (PSD) of the Clz data for four values of Re
in 338 (cid:54) Re (cid:54) 1000. When Re is larger than 332, a new lower frequency St = 0.072
starts to emerge in the ﬂow ﬁeld. This can be seen in panels (a, e) for Re = 338 where a
small peak begins to form around St = 0.072 in the PSD ﬁgure. This frequency becomes
incommensurable when Re further increases and the wake will gradually become chaotic,
which is called pattern P4-0 (with C ly = C lz = 0) and P4-1 (with C ly (cid:54)= 0, occurs at
ar < 1.75) in this article. In Tomboulides & Orszag (2000)’s DNS study on the sphere,
a similar lower frequency value was detected as StRe=500 = 0.045 at a relatively large
Re, which was the second highest peak in the PSD of their DNS data. The frequency
corresponding to the dominant peak was still StRe=500 = 0.167, which was dominant at
all positions of wake. In the work of the axial ﬂow past a short cylinder, Pierson et al.
(2019) also found a similar low frequency (StRe=395 = 0.03) when Re (cid:38) 395 in their DNS
study of the axial ﬂow past a short cylinder.

appear. At this Re, the attractor of Cd-Cly is no longer a limit cycle, but becomes a limit
torus. It means that certain two frequencies in the ﬂow ﬁeld are incommensurable, and the
phase trajectory is no longer closed. The PSD of these two lower frequencies St = 0.0706
and St = 0.0083 is not negligible compared to the dominant frequency St = 0.1528.
At Re = 410, the phase trajectory of Cd-Cly becomes highly disordered, and the PSD
curve shows the characteristics of a chaotic signal. It can be seen from ﬁgure 17(g) that
the dominant frequency is still around St = 0.1611, and its PSD curve shows that there
are many small peaks around St = 0.033, St = 0.094 and St = 0.1611. Finally, when
Re = 1000, the phase diagram is highly chaotic and a broad spectrum of frequencies
appears signalling the disordered state of the ﬂow. In the literature, Sakamoto & Haniu
(1995)’s experimental work on the ﬂow past a sphere showed that, when Re > 420, the
shedding direction of the hairpin vortex appears intermittent, the oscillation amplitude
and waveform caused by the vortex shedding start to become irregular, and the ﬂow ﬁeld
starts to transition from a single-frequency ﬂow to a chaotic state. Pierson et al. (2019)’s
DNS study (in its supplementary materials) on the axial ﬂow past a ﬁnite cylinder (ar =
1) shows that the ﬂow exhibits chaotic properties for the Re in 420 (cid:54) Re (cid:54) 460, and the
secondary lower frequency (StRe=460 = 0.03) gradually dominates the entire ﬂow ﬁeld.
These results of the transition from a single frequency to a chaotic state is similar to that
of the radial ﬂow past a ﬁnite cylinder (ar = 1) as we study here.

4.3. Global modes

The discussions in Sec. 4.2 pertain to the diﬀerent ﬂow patterns (P1-P4) one can obtain
from the nonlinear DNS when increasing the value of Re and the critical values of Re
delimiting the diﬀerent ﬂow regimes. In this section, we will look into the eigenmodes
at certain values of Re and ar for some base states. We report this because we found
that when the parameters change, the type of the mode that becomes the most unstable
changes. If not stated otherwise, the global linear stability analysis to follow is performed
with respect to the mean ﬂow.

Based on the symmetrical and asymmetrical stationary base states, the global eigen-
modes obtained by IRAM codes can be divided into two categories. The ﬁrst type is
the eigenmode with only one symmetric plane (x-y) as shown in ﬁgure 18, and it can

0.72580.7260.7262-0.0100.010.7220.72250.723-0.0200.020.6850.69-0.0200.020.580.6-0.0200.020.0400.150.30.450.6St10-710-510-310-1PSD00.150.30.450.6St10-710-510-310-1PSD00.150.30.450.6St10-710-510-310-1PSD00.150.30.450.6St10-810-610-410-2PSDOnset of vortex shedding around a short cylinder
25
be found at the cases Re > Rec1, ar < 1.75. The second type is the eigenmode with
two mutually perpendicular symmetric planes (x-y and x-z) as shown in ﬁgure 20 in the
parameter ranges Re < Rec1 and ar < 1.75 or ar (cid:62) 1.75. It can be understood that the
global linear eigenmode retains the same structural symmetry as the basic state (either
base ﬂow or mean ﬂow), which is consistent with the results of the global LSA of the
classical three-dimensional non-rotating and rotating sphere (Citro et al. 2016).

(c) eigenmode C with eigenvalue −7.491 × 10−2 + 0.04345i. The Q-criterion isosurfaces
Q = 0 are colored by the x-component of the vorticity ranging from −10−3 to 10−3.

We ﬁrst discuss the case ar = 1, Re = 290, which has the ﬁrst type of eigenmodes. The
typical ﬂow structures of the ﬁrst three eigenmodes in this case are shown in ﬁgure 18,
which are ordered by the real part (the growth rate) of the eigenvalues from large to
small, and are marked as eigenmodes A, B and C, respectively. The imaginary part of
the eigenvalues of the ﬁrst three eigenmodes are all not equal to zero. Modes A and
B appear to have smaller ﬂow structures than mode C, whose frequency is smaller.
Interestingly, we found that the eigenmodes A and B can be favourably compared to
the DNS results and are highly relevant to, respectively, the P3-2 and P3-1 structures
that we have identiﬁed and discussed earlier. Following Sansica et al. (2018), we have
also checked that the mode shape and frequency in the dynamic mode decomposition
(DMD following Schmid 2010) analysis of the nonlinear ﬂow ﬁeld snapshots of the P3-1
pattern are almost the same as those of the linear eigenmode B (DMD results are not
shown). The same correspondence between the DMD mode of the P3-2 pattern and the
global mode A can also be established. Based on these strong links, to further understand
the Hopf bifurcation, the relationship between the eigenvalues of these two eigenmodes
and the Reynolds number in the stability analyses based on the mean ﬂow and the SFD
base ﬂow is shown in ﬁgure 19 (with the speciﬁc data in table 4). In the two panels, the
vertical dash-dot line is Re = Rec2, and the dotted horizontal line is the zero growth
rate σ = 0. In panel (b), the dashed cyan and red solid lines are approximate ﬁttings of

The red solid line also indicates stable solutions and the dashed cyan ones transient ﬂow
states.

From panel a, one can see that at a subcritical Re, the mean ﬂow and the SFD base
ﬂow generate the same results for modes A, B. The decay rates of mode B are both
smaller than those of mode A (i.e., mode A is more stable), which is consistent with the
result that it is sometimes possible to observe wake pattern P3-1 in nonlinear DNS in this
range of Re (note that mode B corresponds to P3-1 pattern). In the supercritical range,
the most unstable mode is now eigenmode A (circles based on the SFD base ﬂow and
green ﬁlled squares based on the mean ﬂow), whose σ increases with Re. The eigenmode
B (red crosses) based on the mean ﬂow is stable. Thus, the amplitude of eigenmode
A will increase exponentially with time until the nonlinearity becomes important. This
can explain that in the evolution of nonlinear DNS, the frequency information of wake
pattern P3-2 (corresponding to eigenmode A) is observed in a supercritical condition.

that the vortex shedding frequency of the P3-1 wake is consistent with the eigenfrequency
of eigenmode B, while the vortex shedding frequency of the P3-2 wake is consistent
with the eigenfrequency of eigenmode A. As we have investigated above, when some
perturbation is added on the initial condition (see the red arrow in panel b), the ﬂow
will transition to the P3-2 structure. Besides, the wake P3-2 (eigenmode A) will appear
at Re > Rec2 as the nonlinearly saturated state. All the ﬂow states superposed by the
cyan dashed lines are transient. These results are consistent with the DNS investigations
in the end of section 4.2.2 that the ﬂow at ar = 1 bifurcates supercritically around the
Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, in the validation Sec. §3.1, we mentioned that the diﬀerence
of vortex shedding frequency between the present result (StP3−2 = 0.142) and the DNS
result in Inoue & Sakuragi (2008) (St = 0.127) at ar = 1, Re = 300 is 10.5%. We think
that the frequency obtained by Inoue & Sakuragi (2008) may be the frequency of P3-1
(our StP3−1 = 0.1295, which is closer to their value with Err = 1.9%) in present work.
According to the results of our nonlinear DNS and LSA, P3-1 is a transitional state. These
results pertain to ar = 1. In the case of other ar values, the ﬂow bifurcation may be
diﬀerent. In a diﬀerent but related context, Sheard et al. (2004) showed that geometric
feature size ar can change the properties of bifurcation in the ﬂow past spheres and
circular cylinders (rings). Thus, the bifurcation types of the radial ﬂow at the other
values of ar deserve to be investigated further in the future.

When ar (cid:62) 1.75, no matter whether the ﬂow is steady or unsteady, the basic
state obtained by the SFD method and the time-average method has two mutually
perpendicular symmetric planes. The eigenmodes obtained based on such symmetrical
basic states also retain the symmetry of their basic state, and the typical structures
are shown in ﬁgure 20. The ﬁgure shows the ﬁrst ﬁve eigenmodes for the case ar =
1.75, Re = 225, ordered by the real part of the eigenvalues from large to small from panel
a to e. The eigenfrequencies (the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues) of the eigenmodes
II and III (panel b and c) are both zero and the corresponding eigenmodes have ﬂow
structures which appear like long strips extending streamwise. On the other hand, the
other eigenmodes with non-zero eigenfrequencies have distinct wave structures in the
streamwise direction.

4.4. Rec-ar diagram
To summarise this work, we present a Rec-ar diagram in ﬁgure 21. The preceding
sections 4.3 and 4.2 mainly discussed the various ﬂow patterns and global modes with
reference to ar = 1. A key focus of this work is to study the eﬀect of ar on the ﬂow
transition in the ﬂow past a ﬁnite-length cylinder (experiencing diﬀerent ﬂow patterns),
which has not been investigated systematically in previous works for this ﬂow. Moreover,
combining present works and the previous research on the ﬂow past a ﬁnite cylinder with
ar > 2, the transition scenarios of this radial ﬂow past a cylinder with two free ends can
be better understood.

Before embarking on the discussion, we mention that in addition to Rec1 (red) and Rec2
(green) the deﬁnitions of which we have discussed in detail in previous sections, we also
deﬁne Rec3 which marks transition from periodic ﬂow to chaotic ﬂow. More speciﬁcally,
Sipp & Lebedev (2007) and Turton et al. (2015) have proved theoretically and numerically
that if a ﬂow is dominated by a single frequency (i.e. monochromatic wave oscillation),
the eigenfrequency of the linearisation operator based on the mean ﬂow is equal to the
nonlinear frequency. Based on this, Rec3 is deﬁned as follows. We increase Re by 5 each
simulation from a lower value of Re and keep track of the dominant eigenfrequency as the
Reynolds number increases. When the diﬀerence between the nonlinear vortex frequency
and the dominant eigenfrequency obtained by the linear IRAM code is consecutively
greater than 1%, we deﬁne the corresponding Re as the third critical Reynolds number
Rec3. For example, when ar = 1, as we increase Re, the ﬁrst time when we have a pair
of consecutive Re whose nonlinear and linear frequencies diﬀer by greater than 1% is
Re = 322 and 327 and we set Rec3 = 322 for this parameter. The physical meaning of
the bifurcation point Rec3 is the transition from a single frequency dominated ﬂow to
the coexistence of multi-frequency oscillations. As for Rec4, it is reminded that this value
delimits the two chaos states P4-0 (with C ly = C lz = 0) and P4-1 (with C ly (cid:54)= 0, occurs
at ar < 1.75), as we have discussed in the previous section.

In ﬁgure 21, one can see that with the increase of ar, the critical Reynolds number
Rec1 ﬁrst decreases and then increases, while the critical Reynolds numbers Rec2 and
Rec3 decrease monotonically in the range of ar from 0 to 2. The relationships between
Rec2-ar and Rec3-ar approximately conform to power functions, as shown by the green
and blue dashed lines in the ﬁgure with the corresponding ﬁtting formula being Rec2 =
158.9ar−1.241 + 117 and Rec3 = 136ar−1.572 + 186.8, respectively. Besides, it can be
seen from ﬁgure 4(b) that as Re increases, C ly will turn to zero again, that is, the wake
pattern P4-1 of C ly (cid:54)= 0 will disappear, and the black-dashed neutral curve is used to
ﬁt the critical Reynolds number of this change of wake. Then, the areas where the ﬂows
with C ly (cid:54)= 0 exist are combined into a thumb-shaped area surrounded by the black and
red dashed lines in ﬁgure 21.

We have also superposed the results of the critical Re (transitioning from a steady
ﬂow to a periodic ﬂow, so should be compared to our Rec2) in the radial ﬂow around
a short cylinder with double hemispherical free ends in Schouveiler & Provansal (2001)
(experiments) and the double plane free ends in Inoue & Sakuragi (2008) (numerical
simulations using ﬁnite diﬀerence method). Their results are supposed to be compared to
our green curves and squares. It can be seen that our results are closer to the experimental
results of Schouveiler & Provansal (2001), and are diﬀerent from the DNS results of Inoue
& Sakuragi (2008). The Hopf bifurcation result of Inoue & Sakuragi (2008) appears to
be close to our Rec1-ar curve obtained. But the regular bifurcation of a radial ﬂow past
the cylinder (ar < 1.75), generating the steady ﬂows with one symmetric plane, found
in this paper was not reported in Inoue & Sakuragi (2008). Nevertheless, this regular

Reynolds numbers in the ﬂow past a sphere (Johnson & Patel 1999) and the axial ﬂow
past a cylinder with ar = 1 (Pierson et al. 2019) have also been superposed. The data
of sphere (Johnson & Patel 1999) is placed along the vertical line of ar = π/4 ≈ 0.785.

bifurcation phenomenon has been widely recognised in the ﬂow past small-ar bluﬀ bodies
such as a sphere (Johnson & Patel 1999; Tomboulides & Orszag 2000; Thompson et al.
2001; Sheard et al. 2004), axial ﬂow around short cylinders with ar = 1 (Pierson et al.
2019) and ellipsoids (Sheard et al. 2008; Tezuka & Suzuki 2006). Indeed, we have also
superposed the Rec1 and Rec2 results of the ﬂows past a sphere (Johnson & Patel 1999)
in ﬁgure 21. Following the discussion in the previous section, we place these data along
the vertical line for ar = π/4 ≈ 0.785. The Rec1 value for the cylinder with ar = 0.75 is
close to that of a sphere in the range of 210 < Rec1 < 212 (reversed triangle), while the
value of Rec2 at ar = 0.75 is larger than that of the sphere’s (270 < Rec2 < 280), see the
black triangle pointing right. Note that this is related to the fact that we place the results
of Johnson & Patel (1999) at ar ≈ 0.785. Besides, the results of Pierson et al. (2019)
on axial ﬂows past an ar = 1 cylinder have also been superimposed in the ﬁgure. The
current three critical Reynolds numbers of the radial ﬂow past a cylinder with ar = 1
are all smaller than those in Pierson et al. (2019)’s DNS results (Rec1 ≈ 278, Rec2 ≈ 355

and Rec3 ≈ 395†, data found in their supplementary material) for the axial ﬂow. This
to some extent indicates that, for the cylinder with ar = 1, the ﬂow separation due
to the curved surface (in our radial ﬂow) is a more eﬃcient destabilising mechanism
than the sharp-edge separation due to the front plane end in an axial ﬂow. This may be
helpful to the discussion of how to place the ﬁnite-length cylinder in a ﬂow to suppress
or stimulate ﬂow instability. In this vein, a more general work will be needed to study
the ﬂow transition and bifurcation past a cylinder for a series of yaw angles.

5. Conclusions

In this paper, we studied systematically the eﬀect of aspect ratio (0.5 (cid:54) ar (cid:54) 2) and
Reynolds number (Re (cid:54) 1000) on the wake patterns and bifurcations (of regular and
Hopf types) in the ﬂow past a ﬁnite-length short cylinder by performing nonlinear DNS
and linear stability analyses (based on both time-mean ﬂow and base ﬂow). The detailed
transition paths of the radial ﬂow around the short cylinder (shown in ﬁgure 21) are
obtained, and combined with the previous research on ar > 2, the present work will help
us to better understand the wake transitions of the cylinder with two free ends.

With the Re increasing from small to large, the ﬁrst ﬂow pattern is a steady wake P1
with two mutually perpendicular symmetric planes. When Re > Rec1, the second ﬂow
pattern P2 emerges and it is also a steady wake but with only one symmetric plane (which
is perpendicular to the cylinder axis). This P2 pattern was not discovered in the DNS
study by Inoue & Sakuragi (2008) on the radial ﬂow past a short cylinder. In the studies
of the ﬂows past sphere, ellipsoid and the axial ﬂow past a short cylinder, a similar ﬂow
structure with C l (cid:54)= 0 has also been found in the experimental and numerical results.
According to our results, this wake pattern P2 only exists in short cylinders with aspect
ratio ar < 1.75; when ar (cid:38) 1.75, as the Re increases, the wake will directly transition
from the pattern P1 to an unsteady wake pattern P3-0 with zero C l.

When Re > Rec2, vortex shedding happens and the ﬂow becomes periodic and
unsteady. Two wake patterns P3-1 and P3-2 have been observed. They have diﬀerent
frequencies and shapes and respectively represent the vortex shedding from the side
surface and free ends of the cylinder. When ar = 1, the P3-1 structure is transient and
will eventually transition to the nonlinearly stable P3-2 pattern. The transition can take
a very long time if Re is close to the critical value and there is no disturbance in the
ﬂow ﬁeld. According to our numerical analyses, the bifurcation around Rec2 at ar = 1
is supercritical as we cannot ﬁnd a nonlinearly stable solution in the subcritical regime
when we change the initial conditions. We have not investigated in detail the type of
the Hopf bifurcation in this ﬂow at other values of ar. When Re is further increased
and is larger than Rec3, the ﬂow becomes chaotic. The main message of this work is
summarised in the diagram on the relation between the aspect ratio ar and the critical
Reynolds numbers. The values of Rec2, Rec3 decreases as ar increases. The critical Rec1
ﬁrst decreases and then increases with the increase of ar, and ﬁnally intersects the ar-
Rec2 curve at ar ≈ 1.75.

Based on mean ﬂow and base ﬂow, global linear stability analyses (LSA) have been
conducted to analyse the instability and bifurcation in the ﬂow past the short cylinder.
By linearly interpolating the real part of the dominant eigenvalue, the aforementioned
two critical Reynolds numbers Rec1 (regular bifurcation) and Rec2 (Hopf bifurcation)

† The deﬁnition of Rec3 in Pierson et al. (2019) is above which the attractor in the drag
coeﬃcient-lift coeﬃcient diagram becomes chaotic. This is in principle diﬀerent than our
deﬁnition, but both deﬁnitions to some extent measure the onset of chaos in the ﬂow.

Onset of vortex shedding around a short cylinder

obtained from DNS results can also be determined in the LSA. When Re < Rec2, the
eigenvalues obtained based on mean ﬂow and base ﬂow are the same; when Re > Rec2,
similar to the 2D cylinder wake ﬂow, the nonlinear vortex frequency is consistent with
the most unstable eigenfrequency based on mean ﬂow, but the diﬀerence between the
nonlinear vortex shedding frequency and the eigenfrequency based on the mean ﬂow
gradually becomes larger when Re increases to a non-monochromatic ﬂow state. Finally,
around the Hopf bifurcation, the previously-discussed wake patterns P3-1 and P3-2 can
be connected to the ﬁrst two global eigenmodes A and B in the global LSA based on
the mean ﬂow. In our numerical analysis, we can ﬁnd that the frequencies and structures
of the ﬁrst two eigenmodes A, B are very close to those of nonlinear wakes P3-2 and
P3-1, respectively. Therefore, based on this strong link, by analysing the linear growth
rates of these eigenmodes, the evolution of the ﬂow can be better understood and a more
accurate reduced-order model of the ﬂow can be proposed in the future.

For future directions, an interesting topic is to investigate the bifurcation type for
other values of ar using a global weakly nonlinear stability analysis or similar stability
analysis following Bengana et al. (2019) based on the mean ﬂow past a ﬁnite cylinder in
LSA to determine the area of hysteresis and the transition conditions of the ﬂow.
