GRADED AR SEQUENCES AND THE HUNEKE-WIEGAND CONJECTURE

ROBERT ROY

ABSTRACT. We let R = Li≥0 Ri be a one-dimensional graded complete intersection, ﬁnitely-generated
over R0 an inﬁnite ﬁeld, satisfying certain degree conditions which are satisﬁed whenever R is a nu-
merical semigroup ring of embedding dimension at least three. We show that a broad class of graded
maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules M satisﬁes the Huneke-Wiegand Conjecture, namely when there
exists an Auslander-Reiten sequence ending in M whose middle term has at least two nonfree direct
summands.

1. INTRODUCTION

The following is called the Huneke-Wiegand Conjecture in, e.g., [6] and [7].

Conjecture 1.1. ([10]) Let D be a Gorenstein local domain of dimension one and M a
nonzero ﬁnitely-generated torsionfree D-module, that is not free. Then M ⊗D M∗ has a
nonzero torsion submodule.

As shown in [9, Theorem 5.9], the above condition on M ⊗D M∗ may be replaced by the
condition that Ext1

D(M, M) 6= 0.

Notation 1.2. If R is a Gorenstein ring of dimension one, and M is a nonfree ﬁnitely-
generated maximal Cohen-Macaulay module, we will say that M “satisﬁes the Huneke-
Wiegand Conjecture" if Ext1

R(M, M) 6= 0.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we deﬁne some general notions, and state
lemmas in the setting of a graded one-dimensional Gorenstein ring, whose use in Section 3
In
will usually be explicitly mentioned, so these lemmas need not be read beforehand.
Section 3, we let R be a one-dimensional graded complete intersection satisfying a certain
degree condition (Deﬁnition 3.1), and prove (Theorem 3.8) that M satisﬁes the Huneke-
Wiegand Conjecture if M is any module in a broad class (see Remark 3.5), namely when
there exists an Auslander-Reiten sequence s(M) ending in M such that the middle term
of s(M) has at least two nonfree direct summands. In Section 4 we show that the degree
condition is satisﬁed by all numerical semigroup rings of embedding dimension at least
three.

2. BACKGROUND: AUSLANDER-REITEN THEORY

Throughout, R will be a commutative, one-dimensional, Gorenstein, graded ring R =
Li≥0 R i graded over the nonnegative integers, where R0 = k is a ﬁeld and R is a ﬁnitely-
generated algebra over k. Denote the graded maximal ideal Li≥1 R i by m. For any graded
R-module M, ΩM will denote the graded syzygy of M, i.e., the kernel of a minimal graded
surjection onto M by a free R-module. We use M∗ to denote HomR(M, R).

We let CM(R) denote the category of graded, ﬁnitely-generated, maximal Cohen-Macaulay
modules (and all R-linear homomorphisms between such), and let L p(R) denote the full
1

 
 
 
 
 
 
subcategory {M ∈ CM(R)|Mp is Rp-free for all nonmaximal prime ideals p ⊂ R}. Let CM(R)0
denote the category whose objects are those of CM(R) and whose morphisms are the degree
zero maps. We say that a module M ∈ CM(R) without free direct summands is periodic if
M ∼= Ω2M, up to a shift in the grading.

Notation 2.1. For R-modules X and Y , we let HomR(X , Y ) denote the quotient of HomR(X , Y )
by those maps which factor through free R-modules.
Lemma 2.2. Let X , Y ∈ CM(R). Then Ext1

R(X , Y ) ∼= HomR(ΩX , Y ).

Proof. Start with the short exact sequence

/ F
(2.1)
where F is a free module. Since ( )∗ is a duality on CM(R), i∗ is epi. Therefore any map from
a free module to (ΩX )∗ factors through i∗. Then the duality implies that any map from ΩX
to a free module factors through i. Therefore we have a right exact sequence

/ X

0

HomR(F, Y )

Hom(i,Y )/

/ HomR(ΩX , Y )

/ HomR(ΩX , Y )

/ 0.

On the other hand, applying HomR(_, Y ) to (2.1) yields

HomR(F, Y )

Hom(i,Y )/

/ HomR(ΩX , Y )

/ Ext1

R(X , Y )

/ Ext1

R(F, Y ) = 0,

and the lemma follows.

(cid:3)

Notation 2.3. The symbol a(R) stands for the integer called the a-invariant of R, a formula
for which is given in (3.1).

Lemma 2.4. There exists a short exact sequence in CM(R)0 of the form

0 −→ R(a) −→ m∗(a) −→ k −→ 0,

where a = a(R).
Proof. As R is Gorenstein of dimension one, we have Ext1
R(k, R(a)) = k. We can obtain the
desired sequence by applying HomR(_, R(a)) to the short exact sequence 0 −→ m −→ R −→
(cid:3)
k −→ 0.

A morphism f : X −→ Y in CM(R)0 is called irreducible if (1) f is neither a split mono-
morphism nor a split epimorphism, and (2) given any pair of morphisms g and h in CM(R)0
satisfying f = gh, either g is a split epimorphism or h is a split monomorphism.

Let M be a nonfree indecomposable in L p(R). Then [1, Theorem 3] the category CM(R)0
admits an Auslander-Reiten (AR) sequence ending in M. That is, there exists a short exact
sequence

(2.2)

in CM(R)0 such that N is indecomposable and the following property is satisﬁed: Any map
L −→ M in CM(R)0 which is not a split epimorphism factors through g (equivalently, any
map N −→ L in CM(R)0 which is not a split monomorphism factors through f ). In this paper
R is Gorenstein, and therefore (1) there is also an AR sequence beginning at M, and (2) the
modules in (2.2) all lie in L p(R) (to see this, use Lemma 2.11).

Deﬁnition 2.5. Given an AR sequence (2.2), N is called the Auslander-Reiten translate of
M, written τM. One may equivalently write τ−1 N = M.

/ τM

/ 0 be an AR sequence in CM(R)0. Then,
Lemma 2.6. Let 0
given any Y ∈ CM(R), a degree zero map h : τM −→ Y is irreducible if and only if there
exists a split epimorphism p ∈ HomR(X , Y )0 such that h = p f . Dually, a degree zero map
h′ : Y ′ −→ M is irreducible if and only if there exists a split monomorphism ι ∈ HomR(Y , X )0
such that h′ = gι.

/ M

/ X

Proof. Cf. [14, Lemma 2.13], [2, Ch. V, Theorem 5.3].

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.7. ([13, Lemma 4.1.8]) If f : M −→ N is an irreducible map in CM(R)0, then f
must be either a monomorphism or an epimorphism.

Notation 2.8. Several short exact sequences in this paper will include a written direct-sum-
decomposition (not necessarily into indecomposables) of the middle term, for example

0

/ Y1 ⊕ Y2
Given such a diagram, if we write f = [ f1, f2]T and g = [g1, g2], this means that g restricted
to Yi is g i, and similarly f induces maps f1 : X −→ Y1 and f2 : X −→ Y2 with respect to the
direct sum decomposition Y1 ⊕ Y2.

in CM(R)0, then each f i and g i is irreducible, and: f1 is a monomorphism if and only if g2
is a monomorphism.

/ Y1 ⊕ Y2

Proof. The ﬁrst sentence is straightforward, and the second follows from Lemmas 2.6 and 2.7.
(cid:3)

Notation 2.10. If M is a graded R-module, and n ∈ Z, then the graded shift M(n) is the
graded R-module given by M(n)i = Mn+i, ∀i ∈ Z.

Lemma 2.11. For any indecomposable nonfree M ∈ L p(R), we have τM = ΩM(a), where
a = a(R) is the a-invariant of R.

Proof. Cf. [14, Proposition 3.11] or the proof of [1, Theorem 3].

(cid:3)

Notation 2.12. Let f : M −→ N be a morphism in CM(R)0. By extending f to a map between
the minimal free resolutions of M and N, we get induced morphisms Ωn f : Ωn M −→ Ωn N ∈
CM(R)0, for each integer n. (Of course, these are not quite uniquely determined.) Likewise,
we have morphisms τn f : Ωn M(a(R)) −→ Ωn N(a(R)).

Lemma 2.13. ([11, Theorem 3.1],[13, Lemma 4.1.7]) Let f : M −→ N be a morphism in
CM(R)0, and assume M and N contain no free direct summands. If f is irreducible, then so
is any choice of Ωn f , for all n ∈ Z.

Lemma 2.14. Let M and N be ﬁnitely-generated, graded R-modules, and assume M has no
free direct summand. If f : M −→ N factors through a free R-module, then f (M) ⊆ mN.

Proof. We may assume N is free. As f is necessarily a sum of graded maps (cf. [4, Exercise
1.5.19 (f)]), we may assume f is homogeneous. Now if m ∈ M is homogeneous, and f (m) ∉
mN, then f (m) can be extended to a basis of N, and we may obtain a surjection M −→ R f (m),
(cid:3)
contradicting our assumption that M has no free direct summand.

Lemma 2.15. Let f : M −→ N be a morphism in CM(R)0, and let n be an integer. If g and
h ∈ HomR(ΩnM, Ωn N) are two choices for Ωn f , and g is epi, then so is h.

Proof. For n ≥ 0, it is well known that g − h must factor through a free module, and it is easy
to see that this still holds for n < 0 by Gorenstein duality. Therefore (g − h)(ΩnM) ⊆ mΩn N
(cid:3)
by Lemma 2.14. The assertion now follows from Nakayama’s Lemma.

Lemma 2.16. [13, Lemma 4.1.13] Let 0
quence in CM(R)0. Then Ωg is an epimorphism if and only if mX = X ∩ mY .

sequence in CM(R)0 with g irreducible, and suppose that Ωg is a monomorphism. Then there
exist graded maps i : X −→ m∗ and j : m∗ −→ Y in CM(R) such that f = ji; in particular, X
is isomorphic to a graded ideal of R, up to a graded shift.
Proof. It is part of the general (Auslander-Reiten) folklore that if f ′ : X −→ Y ′ is any map in
CM(R)0, then either f factors through f ′ or f ′ factors through f (in CM(R)0). To see this, as-
sume that f ′ does not factor through f . This says that the pushout of 0
by f ′ does not split. Therefore, the irreducibility of g implies that the middle map in the
diagram

is a split monomorphism, and it follows that f factors through f ′.

From the short exact sequence 0 −→ R(a) −→ m∗(a) −→ k −→ 0 (Lemma 2.4), we obtain a

commutative square

/ HomR(X , k)

R(Y , R) = Ext1

where the horizontal maps are surjective since Ext1
R(X , R) = 0 (as R is one-
dimensional Gorenstein). From Lemma 2.16 it follows that dimk(Y ⊗R k) < dimk(X ⊗R k) +
dimk(Z ⊗R k), i.e., dimk(HomR(Y , k)) < dimk(HomR(X , k)) + dimk(HomR(Z, k)), and therefore
the map HomR( f , k) : HomR(Y , k) −→ HomR(X , k) is not an epimorphism. Then, in turn, the
map HomR( f , m∗(a)) : HomR(Y , m∗(a)) −→ HomR(X , m∗(a)) is not epi (because the horizon-
tal maps in (2.3) are epi). Therefore, we may pick f ′ ∈ HomR(X , m∗) which does not factor
through f . We may also assume f is homogeneous of some degree, cf. [4, Exercise 1.5.19
(f)]. It then follows from our ﬁrst sentence in this proof that f = j f ′ for some homogeneous
j : m∗ −→ Y . We know that f ′ : X −→ m∗ is mono, because f is mono. Lastly, note that there

exists a monomorphism X ,→ R, because there exists a monomorphism m∗ ,→ R (since m∗ is
(cid:3)
a ﬁnitely-generated submodule of R[nonzerodivisors]−1).

Deﬁnition 2.18. If X and Y are modules in CM(R) having no free direct summands, we say
that an irreducible map g : X −→ Y is eventually Ω-perfect if either Ωn g is epi for all large
n, or Ωn g is mono for all large n.

Lemma 2.19. (cf.
/ X
/ Y

[8, Proposition 2.4]) Assume that R is a complete intersection, and let
g
/ 0 be a short exact sequence in CM(R)0, such that g is irre-
0
ducible and not eventually Ω-perfect. Then, for all n ≥ 0 such that Ωn g is epi and Ωn+1 g is
mono, we have that ker(Ωn g) is isomorphic to a periodic ideal.

/ Z

Proof. For each n ≥ 0 we can apply the Horseshoe Lemma to obtain a short exact sequence

If Ωn g is surjective, then so is f1 (Lemma 2.9) and this implies F n = 0, since Ωn X cannot
have a free direct summand. So if Ωn+1 g is mono while Ωn g is surjective, then

/ 0 for some free module F n, and ξ ∈ HomR(F n, ΩnZ)0.

/ F n ⊕ ΩnY

/ ΩnZ

Ωn X ∼= ker(Ωn g) is isomorphic to an ideal,
by Lemma 2.17. Since Ωn X is thus isomorphic to an ideal for inﬁnitely many n ≥ 0, it
follows that the free modules in a minimal resolution of X have bounded rank (cf.
[13,
Lemma 4.1.17]). Therefore X is eventually periodic, by [5, Theorem 4.1]. As X ∈ CM(R) and
(cid:3)
R is Gorenstein, X is in fact already periodic.

3. HUNEKE-WIEGAND CONJECTURE

Let S = k[x1, . . ., xe] = Li≥0 S i be a graded polynomial ring over an inﬁnite ﬁeld k, where
each xi is homogenenous (of any positive degree), k = S0, and e ≥ 2. Let f1, . . ., f e−1 ∈ S be a
regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials, and let R = S/( f1, . . ., f e−1). We assume that
e = edim R, the embedding dimension of R (i.e., each f i ∈ (x1, . . ., xe)2)). Let ai = deg xi, and
d i = deg f i. Then the a-invariant of R is ([4, 3.6.14-15])

(3.1)

a(R) =

e−1
X
i=1

d i −

ai.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let dmax = max{d1, . . ., d e−1}. We will say that R “satisﬁes Condition (*)" if
a(R) > dmax/2.

In Section 4 we show that Condition (*) is satisﬁed by all complete intersection numerical
semigroup rings of embedding dimension at least three.

Deﬁnition 3.2. We will call an indecomposable module M ∈ L p(R) elevated if

min{i|(τM)i 6= 0} < min{i|Mi 6= 0}.

(Recall that τ denotes the AR translate; see Deﬁnition 2.5 and Lemma 2.11.)

Notice that if M is elevated, then there exists no monomorphism τM ,→ M in CM(R)0.

Lemma 3.3. Assume R satisﬁes Condition (*), and let M be an indecomposable nonfree
module in L p(R). Then there exists n0, depending on M, such that for all n ≥ n0, either ΩnM
is elevated or Ωn+1 M is elevated (or both).

Proof. Let (F, ∂) : . . .
bud’s construction of cohomology operators [5], take a graded lifting ( ˜F, ˜∂) of (F, ∂) to free
S-modules, that is, ( ˜F, ˜∂) is a graded sequence of free S-modules such that ˜∂ ⊗S R = ∂. Then
for j ∈ {1, . . ., e − 1}, and all n, we can choose graded maps t j : ˜Fn+2 −→ ˜Fn such that

/ F1

˜∂2 = P j f j t j, and deg t j = −d j for each j ∈ {1, . . ., e − 1}.
Now let ˆR = Qi≥0 R i (the completion of R with respect to m) and consider the resolution of
free ˆR-modules ( ˆF, ˆ∂) induced by ∂, as well as the maps ˆt j : ˆFn+2 −→ ˆFn induced by the t j’s.
e−1
From the proof of [5, Theorem 3.1], there exist g1, . . ., g e ∈ ˆR such that ˆt1+P
j=2 g j ˆt j : ˆFn+2 −→
ˆFn is an epimorphism for all large n.

It follows that, for large n, min{i|(Fn+2)i 6= 0} − min{i|(Fn)i 6= 0} ≤ dmax. In other words,
min{i|(Ωn+2 M)i 6= 0}−min{i|(ΩnM)i 6= 0} ≤ dmax, which implies that either min{i|(Ωn+2M)i 6=
0} − min{i|(Ωn+1 M)i 6= 0} ≤ dmax/2 or min{i|(Ωn+1 M)i 6= 0} − min{i|(Ωn M)i 6= 0} ≤ dmax/2. The
(cid:3)
result now follows from Condition (*), since τn M = Ωn M(n · a(R)), by Lemma 2.11.
Deﬁnition 3.4. Given an AR sequence 0 −→ τM −→ X −→ M −→ 0, and writing X = Li X i
as a direct sum of indecomposable modules X i, deﬁne α(M) to be the number of (not neces-
sarily nonisomorphic) summands X i which are nonfree.

Remark 3.5. Let X and Y be nonfree indecomposables in L p(R), such that α(X ) and α(Y )
are both equal to 1. For the sake of simplicity, assume also that X is not a direct summand
of m (so that there exists no irreducible map X −→ R), and Y is not a direct summand of m∗
(so that there exists no irreducible map R −→ Y ). Then there exists no irreducible morphism
X −→ Y (i.e., X and Y are not adjacent in the stable AR quiver). Indeed, any irreducible
map X −→ X ′ is mono and any irreducible map Y ′ −→ Y is epi, by Lemma 2.6. Thus the
nonfree indecomposables M ∈ L p(R) having α(M) ≥ 2 form a broad class.

Lemma 3.6. Assume R satisﬁes Condition (*), and let M be a nonfree indecomposable in
L p(R), with α(M) ≥ 2. Then there exists a nonfree indecomposable X ∈ CM(R) and an irre-
ducible morphism p : τM −→ X in CM(R)0, such that the set

N := {n ≥ 0|Ωn p is epi and Ωn M is elevated}

is inﬁnite.

Certainly τn M is elevated for inﬁnitely many n ≥ 0, by Lemma 3.3. We claim that for
each such n, τn f i is epi for some i ∈ {1, . . ., l}. Note that, given the AR sequence (3.2), the
map ξ : τn M −→ F ′ must be mono, since otherwise it would be epi (Lemma 2.7) and therefore
split, contradicting the fact that it is irreducible. So if we write g′ = [g′
l+1], and if τn f i
is mono for each i ∈ {1, . . ., l}, then it follows from Lemma 2.9 that each of g′
l+1 is mono.

Then g′
1 ◦ (τn f1), for example, is a degree zero monomorphism, which contradicts that τn M
is elevated. Thus the claim is thus proved, and the lemma follows (by applying a version of
(cid:3)
the “pigeonhole principle").
Lemma 3.7. If edim R ≥ 3, then m∗ is not periodic.

Proof. See [3, Theorem 8.1.2].

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.8. Assume that either R is isomorphic to a numerical semigroup ring k[ta1, . . ., tae],
or that edim R ≥ 3 and R satisﬁes Condition (*). If M ∈ L p(R) is a nonfree indecomposable
with α(M) ≥ 2, then HomR(τM, M)0 6= 0, and M satisﬁes the Huneke-Wiegand Conjecture.
Proof. If edim R < 3, and R is a domain (for example, a numerical semigroup ring), then M
satisﬁes the Huneke-Wiegand Conjecture by [10, Theorem 3.7]. If R is a numerical semi-
group ring with edim R ≥ 3, then we will see in Proposition 4.10 that R satisﬁes Condition
(*). So for this proof, assume that edim R ≥ 3 and R satisﬁes Condition (*). Now assume, to
the contrary, that HomR(τM, M)0 = 0. Take p : τM −→ X and N as in Lemma 3.6.

First we set about proving the following claim: τn+1 p is epi for all sufﬁciently large n ∈ N .
If p is eventually Ω-perfect then the claim holds (by choice of p), so assume otherwise.

Let n ∈ N , i.e., τn p : τn+1 M −→ τn X is epi and τn M is elevated. Let us ﬁrst observe that:

There exists an irreducible mono ι : τn X −→ τn M in CM(R)0.
(3.3)
Indeed, there exists an irreducible map τn X −→ τn M by Lemma 2.6, and if it were epi then
the composition with the epimorphism τn p would (by Lemma 2.14) give a nonzero element
(Indeed, HomR(Ωn+1 M, Ωn M) ∼= HomR(ΩM, M)
of HomR(τn+1 M, τn M)0
for all n ∈ Z since R is Gorenstein.)

∼= HomR(τM, M)0.

Now, suppose τn+1 p is mono. Letting K = ker(τn p), we know K is isomorphic to a pe-
riodic ideal, by Lemma 2.19. Letting κ denote the inclusion map κ : K ,→ τn+1 M, we have
κ = κ′′κ′ for some graded maps κ′ : K −→ m∗ and κ′′ : m∗ −→ τn+1 M, by Lemma 2.17. Note
that K ∼= K ∗∗ ∼= HomR(K ∗, m) since K lies in CM(R) and has no free direct summand. This
implies that K is a module over EndR m = m∗. So if 1 ∈ κ′(K ), then κ′ must be a split epi,
contradicting that K is periodic and m∗ is not (Lemma 3.7). So 1 ∉ κ′(K ), while on the other
hand, κ′′(1) must be nonzero since otherwise κ′′ would be zero.

Let us observe that the latter sentence implies that κ(K ) ∩ (τn+1 M)i0 = 0 where i0 =
min{i|(τn+1 M)i 6= 0}. To check this, note that a(R) is positive by Condition (*), and there-
fore by the short exact sequence 0 −→ R −→ m∗ −→ k(−a) −→ 0 (Lemma 2.4), we have that
(m∗)0 = R0 is a one-dimensional k-vector space, and (m∗)i = R i = 0 for all i < 0. So indeed
we see that since the image of K does not touch the lowest degree of m∗, and the lowest
degree of m∗ does not go to zero in τn+1 M, therefore κ(K ) does not touch the lowest degree
of τn+1 M.

Therefore τn p restricted to (τn+1 M)i0 is injective. But together with (3.3), this implies
(τn M)i0 6= 0, and this is a contradiction since τn M is elevated, by deﬁnition of N . So the
claim, that τn+1 p is epi for all sufﬁciently large n ∈ N , is proved.

Therefore, using Lemma 3.3 and the fact that HomR(τM, M) ∼= HomR(τn+1 M, τn M) for all

n ∈ Z, we may assume that p : τM −→ X is itself epi and that τ−1 X is elevated.

By Lemma 2.6, the AR sequence beginning with X has the form

(Recall that e( ) is additive along short exact sequences, and positive on CM(R).) Therefore,
τg1 : τM −→ X is also epi, by Lemma 2.7. This implies that Ωg is epi.

Now let 0 6= w ∈ X j0 where j0 = min{ j ∈ Z|X j 6= 0}. Then f (w) ∉ mM ⊕ mZ, by Lemma 2.16,
and therefore f2(w) 6= 0, since f1(X ) ⊆ mM. Meanwhile g2 is mono by Lemma 2.9, and
so g2 f2(w) 6= 0. This contradicts the assumption that τ−1 X is elevated. So the assertion
HomR(τM, M)0 6= 0 is proved. Now by Lemma 2.2, Ext1
R(M, M) 6= 0, i.e. M satisﬁes the

The purpose of this section is to prove Proposition 4.10.

4. NUMERICAL SEMIGROUPS

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let N denote the natural numbers {0, 1, 2, . . .}. A numerical semigroup is a
subset S of N such that 0 ∈ S, s + s′ ∈ S whenever s and s′ are in S, and N \ S is ﬁnite. The
numerical semigroup generated by positive integers a1, . . ., ae (such that gcd(a1, . . ., ae) = 1)
is the set {n1a1 +· · ·+ n eae|n1, . . ., n e ∈ N} = Na1 +. . .Nae. If S = Na1 +. . .Nae, k[S] will denote
the graded k-algebra k[ta1, . . ., tae] ⊆ k[t] where deg t = 1. The Frobenius of a numerical
semigroup S is max{n ∈ Z|n ∉ S}, and we denote this integer by F(S). A numerical semigroup
S is said to be complete intersection if k[S] is a complete intersection. In this case F(S) =
a(k[S]) (see, e.g., [13, Proposition 2.3.3]), so in particular we can use formula (3.1) to ﬁnd
F(S).

Deﬁnition 4.2. Consider a numerical semigroup S which is minimally generated by a1, . . ., ae.
We may take an additive surjection from the free monoid Free(Y1, . . ., Ye) = {n1Y1 + · · · +
n eYe|n1, . . ., n e ∈ N}, ϕ : Free(Y1, . . .Ye) −→ S sending Yi to ai. A minimal presentation for S
is a set ρ ⊂ Free(Y1, . . ., Ye) × Free(Y1, . . ., Ye) which generates the kernel congruence {(u, v) ∈
Free(Y1, . . ., Ye)|ϕ(u) = ϕ(v)}; see [12, Chapter 7]. For r = (r1, r2) ∈ ρ, we will use the nota-
tion |r| = ϕ(r1) = ϕ(r2). The numbers {|r|}r∈ρ are the same as the {d i} from Section 3, when
R ∼= k[S].

Deﬁnition 4.3. For a complete intersection numerical semigroup S, we will abuse notation
slightly by saying that “S satisﬁes Condition (*)” if k[S] satisﬁes Condition (*). Instead of
writing a(R) > dmax/2, we may alternatively write

where F(S) is the Frobenius of S and ρ is a minimal presentation of S.

F(S) > |r|/2 for all r ∈ ρ,

Deﬁnition 4.4. [12, Ch. 8, §3] Let S and S′ be two numerical semigroups minimally gener-
ated by {a1, . . ., ae} and {a′
e′}
be such that gcd(λ, µ) = 1. Then S′′ = Nµa1 + · · · + Nµae + Nλa′

Proof. For the ﬁrst statement, see [12, Lemma 9.8]. We have for example λ ≥ 2 because
(cid:3)
λ ∈ S \ {a1, . . ., ae}.

Lemma 4.6. (See the proof of [12, Proposition 9.9].) Assume we have S, S′, and S′′ as in
Deﬁnition 4.4, and let ρ and ρ′ be minimal presentations of S and S′, respectively. Assume
that S and S′ are complete intersections. Then S′′ is minimally presented by ρ ∪ ρ′ together
with a single additional element r, with |r| ∈ λµN.

Theorem 4.7. [12, Theorem 9.10] A numerical semigroup other than N is a complete inter-
section if and only if it is a gluing of two complete intersection numerical semigroups.

Lemma 4.8. Let m and n be relatively prime integers ≥ 2. Then mn/2 − m − n ≥ −2, and the
only cases when mn/2 − m − n ≤ 0 are when either 2 ∈ {m, n} or {m, n} ∈ {{3, 4}, {3, 5}}.

Lemma 4.9. Let S and S′ be complete intersection numerical semigroups. Assume that S
satisﬁes Condition (*) and is not equal to N, and either: S′ can be generated by 1 or 2 elements,
or S′ satisﬁes Condition (*). Then each gluing of S and S′ satisﬁes Condition (*) as well.

Proof. Assume all notation in Deﬁnition 4.4. Let ρ and ρ′ denote minimal presentations of S
and S′ respectively, and let {d1, . . ., d e−1} = {|r|}r∈ρ and {d′
e′−1} = {|r′|}r′∈ρ′. Formula (3.1)

Since F(S) ≥ 1 and F(S′) ≥ −1, we obtain F(S′′) − d′′/2 ≥ d′′/2 + µ − λ ≥ λµ/2 + µ − λ, which is
positive since µ ≥ 2. Using (4.1) and (4.1), we have F(S′′) = d′′ +µF(S)+λF(S′) > d′′ +µd j/2+
λF(S′) > µd j/2 for each j ∈ {1, . . ., e − 1}; and if S′ satisﬁes Condition (*) then symmetrically

Proposition 4.10. Let S be a complete intersection numerical semigroup, minimally gen-
erated by {a1, . . ., ae}. Then S satisﬁes Condition (*), unless e = 2 and either 2 ∈ {a1, a2} or
{a1, a2} ∈ {{3, 4}, {3, 5}}.

Proof. First suppose e = 2. Now d1 = a1a2 and F(S) = a1a2 − a1 − a2, and we are done by
Lemma 4.8.

Now suppose e = 3. Then, by [12, Theorem 10.6] (or alternatively Theorem 4.7) there
exist relatively prime integers m1 and m2 greater than one, and nonnegative integers a,
b, and c such that S = Nam1 + Nam2 + N(bm1 + cm2), and furthermore, a ≥ 2, b + c ≥ 2,
and gcd(a, bm1 + cm2) = 1.
In this case, the minimal presentation ρ of S has {|r|}r∈ρ =
{am1m2, a(bm1 + cm2)}, and

(4.3)

F(S) = a(m1m2 − m1 − m2) + (a − 1)(bm1 + cm2).
First, notice that F(S)−a(bm1+ cm2)/2 = a(m1m2 −m1 −m2)+(a/2−1)(bm1+ cm2) is positive
since m1m2 − m1 − m2 > 0 and a ≥ 2.

(4.4)

To ﬁnish the e = 3 case, suppose (with the aim of a contradiction) F(S) ≤ am1m2/2, i.e.,
a(m1m2/2 − m1 − m2) ≤ (1 − a)(bm1 + cm2).
However, a(m1m2/2 − m1 − m2) ≥ −2a by Lemma 4.8; so we get −2a ≤ (1 − a)(bm1 + cm2),
and thus bm1 + cm2 ≤ 2a/(a − 1) ≤ 4. Since a strict inequality bm1 + cm2 < 4 is impossible
(as b + c ≥ 2), we get bm1 + cm2 = 2a/(a − 1) = 4. So a = 2 and bm1 + cm2 = 4, contradicting
gcd(a, bm1 + cm2) = 1.

Having ﬁnished cases e = 2 and e = 3, we proceed to the induction part, which requires
little additional work in light of Theorem 4.7 and Lemma 4.9. In fact the only thing left
to check is that any gluing of two-generated numerical semigroups (not counting N as two-
generated) satisﬁes Condition (*). So let S = Na1 + Na2, S′ = Na′

wish to check that each of {µa1a2, λa′
Lemma 4.6) and F(S′′) = d′′ + µ(a1a2 − a1 − a2) + λ(a′
2) = d′′ + F(S) + F(S′). We
have F(S′′) − d′′/2 > 0 since F(S) and F(S′) are positive. Meanwhile, by Lemma 4.8, F(S′′) −
µa1a2/2 = d′′ + µ(a1a2/2 − a1 − a2) + F(S′) ≥ d′′ − 2µ + F(S′) ≥ λµ − 2µ + 1 > 0. The proof that
