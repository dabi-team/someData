2D heterostructures are more than a sum of the parent 2D materials, but are also a product of 

the interlayer coupling, which can induce new properties. In this paper we present a method 

to tune the interlayer coupling in Bi2Se3/MoS2 2D heterostructures by regulating the oxygen 

presence in  the  atmosphere,  while  applying  laser  or  thermal  energy. Our  data  suggests  the 

interlayer coupling is tuned through the diffusive intercalation and de-intercalation of oxygen 

molecules. When one layer of Bi2Se3 is grown on monolayer MoS2, an influential interlayer 

coupling  is  formed  that  quenches  the  signature  photoluminescence  (PL)  peaks.  However, 

thermally annealing in the presence of oxygen disrupts the interlayer coupling, facilitating the 

emergence of the MoS2 PL peak. DFT calculations predict intercalated oxygen  increases the 

interlayer  separation  ~17%,  disrupting  the  interlayer  coupling  and  inducing  the  layers  to 

behave  more  electronically  independent.  The  interlayer  coupling  can  then  be  restored  by 

thermally annealing in N2 or Ar, where the peaks will re-quench. Hence, this is an interesting 

oxygen-induced  switching  between  “non-radiative”  and  “radiative”  exciton  recombination. 

This  switching  can  also  be  accomplished  locally,  controllably,  and  reversibly  using  a  low-

power focused laser, while changing the environment from pure N2 to air. This allows for the 

interlayer coupling to be precisely manipulated with submicron spatial resolution, facilitating 

site-programmable  2D  light-emitting  pixels  whose  emission  intensity  could  be  precisely 

varied  by  a  factor  exceeding  200×.  Our  results  show  that  these  atomically-thin  2D 

heterostructures may be excellent candidates for oxygen sensing.

Research in 2D heterostructures continues to gain enormous interest for their potential to advance 

both fundamental and application-oriented research. They have contributed to fields as diverse 

as  transistors,[1]–[3]  optoelectronics,[4]–[6]  information  storage,[7]–[9]  plasmonics,[10]–[12] 

photocatalysis,[13]–[15]  capacitors,[16],  [17]  biosensors,[18]  spintronics,[19],  [20]  high-density 

lithium  storage,[21],  [22]  and  superconductivity.[23]–[25]  The  far-reaching  success  of  2D 

heterostructures is in part due to the large spectrum of properties they have demonstrated. A 2D 

heterostructure’s properties are more than a sum of the parent 2D materials, but are also a product 

of the interlayer interaction, which can be manipulated to engineer new capabilities. It has been 

shown  that  the  twist  angle,[26]  interlayer  spacing,[25]  thermal  annealing,[27]–[29]  and 

intercalation  of  molecules[30]–[32]  all  influence  the  interlayer  coupling.  There  are  no  tools  to 

directly probe the interlayer coupling strength; however, its impact can be inferred by the extent 

it  influences  the  properties.  In  this  paper  we  demonstrate  that  the  interlayer  coupling  in 

Bi2Se3/MoS2  2D  heterostructures  can  be  tuned  by  regulating  the  oxygen  presence  in  the 

atmosphere, while applying controlled laser or thermal energy doses. The coupling strength is 

inferred using changes in the photoluminescence (PL) intensity, where lower PL corresponds to 

higher  coupling.  Our  data  suggests  the  interlayer  coupling  is  modulated  by  diffusively 

intercalating and de-intercalating oxygen molecules.  

The  interlayer  coupling  in  2D  materials  is  considered  a  promising  parameter  for  designing 

materials  with  tailored  properties;  however,  despite  the  significant  interest,  the  interlayer 

coupling is not well understood, which is in part due to the lack of experimental techniques with 

the ability to precisely manipulate it. Some previous experimental work has focused on using 

global  thermal  annealing  to  manipulate  the  coupling;  however,  this  method  has  not 

demonstrated  precision,  and  often  requires  several  hours 

to  complete.[27]–[29]  Ion 

irradiation,[33] in-plane strain,[34] and lateral pressure[25], [35] have all been shown to increase 

the interlayer coupling by decreasing the interlayer separation; however, ion irradiation has also 

been shown to damage 2D materials and induce defects[36]–[38], and applying strain or pressure 

alters  the  2D  material’s  lattice  parameters  and  properties,[39]–[41]  thereby  introducing 

2 

 
 
uncertainty.  Work  to  manipulate  the  interlayer  coupling  via  electric  fields  has  only  been 

theoretical, and follow-up experimental work is needed to confirm it.[42]–[45] In this paper we 

demonstrate a facile method to tune the interlayer coupling in-situ with high-spatial resolution, 

all using ambient conditions and tools commonly found in a 2D research laboratory.  

Monolayer MoS2 is known, among other things, for having a bright PL due to the formation of 

tightly-bound excitons.[46] However, when only one layer of Bi2Se3 is grown on the monolayer 

MoS2  using  vapor-phase  deposition,  the  bright  PL  is  >99%  quenched  because  the  interlayer 

coupling  induces  a  non-radiative  exciton  recombination  pathway.[7]  In  this  paper  we 

demonstrate that the PL can be controllably increased and decreased at small increments of only 

a few percent, suggesting that the coupling is being diminished or strengthened, respectively, at 

the same small increments. This is done by applying energy to the material in either an oxygen-

present or oxygen-absent environment, which we believe facilitates the diffusive intercalation or 

de-intercalation  of  oxygen  molecules.  Our  results  suggest  that  the  diffusive  intercalation  of 

oxygen  molecules  induces  the  monolayer  MoS2  to  behave  more  electronically  independent, 

thereby  restoring  the  radiative  recombination  pathway  and  facilitating  the  emergence  of  the 

signature PL peak.  

The intercalation of molecules between layers has been shown to disrupt their coupling, leading 

to change in the properties.[21], [30]–[32], [47]–[53] For example, it has been shown that when 

several  layer  MoS2  is  intercalated  with  lithium  or  quaternary  ammonium  molecules,  the 

signature  monolayer  photoluminescence  emerges,  suggesting  the  intercalated  molecules 

induce the MoS2 layers to behave electronically independent, as if they were monolayer.[30], 

[47], [54] It has also been shown that oxygen can easily intercalate between 2D crystals and their 

substrates, decoupling the two materials and inducing them to behave more “freestanding” (i.e. 

electronically independent).[31], [32], [48]–[52] 

A  natural  question  arises  as  to  why  oxygen,  vice  other  molecules  in  the  atmosphere,  is 

manipulating the interlayer coupling in Bi2Se3/MoS2 2D heterostructure. Bi2Se3 is well-known for 

its oxygen-affinity. It has been shown that initial absorption of oxygen p-dopes the crystal,[55]–

3 

 
[57]  gradually  destroying  its  exotic  topological  properties  and  eventually  forming  wide-band 

bismuth and selenium oxides.[56] Indeed, the deleterious oxidation of Bi2Se3 has so far restricted 

most practical applications using Bi2Se3. 

In  this  work,  we  obtain  highly  controllable,  reversible,  and  site-selectable  switching  between 

direct  (i.e.  radiative  and  photoluminescent)  and 

indirect  (i.e.  non-radiative)  exciton-

recombination  pathways  in  Bi2Se3/MoS2  2D  heterostructures  (1-3  layers  of  Bi2Se3  grown  on 

monolayer  MoS2).  Our  approach  allows  permanent,  in-situ,  electrode-less,  and  use-specific 

programming of the interlayer coupling and PL intensity. Exciton recombination dynamics could 

be switched (between radiative and non-radiative) by annealing the heterostructures in oxygen-

present (e.g. air) vs. inert atmospheres (i.e. Ar or N2). Alternately, the switching could be localized 

in a highly controllable manner at ambient temperatures using a focused laser (as before, in air 

or  under  N2),  which  allowed  site-selective  reversible  manipulation  of  different  regions  of  the 

same 2D heterostructures. Additionally, our results suggest that these 2D heterostructures might 

have  applications  as  standard  temperature-pressure  high-density  oxygen  storage  devices, 

potentially storing 69 kg/m3 (a factor of 52 times the density of O2 gas at 1 atm).

on SiO2, where the monolayer MoS2 was grown using vapor-phase chalcogenization (VPC)[58] 

and the Bi2Se3 was grown on top using vapor-phase deposition. Figure 1b is a side-view diagram 

of a typical Bi2Se3/MoS2 2D heterostructure. Despite the huge lattice mismatch (e.g. 2.74Å to 3.57Å, 

see SI.1), uniform layers of Bi2Se3 grow with high regularity on top of the MoS2 crystal, suggesting 

strong  van  der  Waals  epitaxy-mediated  growth  between  the  two  component  layers.[59]  SI.2 

shows the transfer characteristics of back-gated monolayer MoS2 and Bi2Se3/MoS2 FET devices. 

The  right-shift  of  the  threshold  gate  voltage  in  the  2D  heterostructure  indicates  a  relative 

downshift  of  the  effective  Fermi  level  due  to  reduction  of  excess  n-type  carriers  (by  about 

~9.50x1012 cm-2). The device response looks neither like monolayer MoS2, nor few layer Bi2Se3 (a 

semi-metal),[60]  suggesting  there  is  sufficient  interlayer  coupling  to  modify  the  electronic 

structure of both materials.

Figure  2.  Manipulating  the  interlayer  coupling  using  oxygen  and  energy  (a)  Optical  image  of  a  Bi2Se3/MoS2 
vertical 2D heterostructure where energy was applied locally using a focused laser, while the sample was in an 
oxygen-present environment (i.e. air). The optical properties of the affected area were altered going from purple 
to white, allowing affected locations to  be  easily identified. (b) PL spectra from the same spot before and after 
energy was applied, demonstrating how the interlayer coupling can be manipulated. Initially, the PL spectra was 
flat; however, after applying a focused laser for 8 minutes  at 168μW, a PL spectra corresponding to monolayer 
MoS2  appeared,  suggesting  the  interlayer  coupling  was  disrupted,  allowing  the  MoS2  layer  became  more 
electronically independent. Electronically independent monolayer MoS2 has a signature PL peak due to its tightly 
bound excitons. (c) The laser was now applied to a different location (orange arrow) on the same sample at the 
same power (168μW for 12 minutes), but the environment was changed from oxygen to nitrogen. Interestingly, 
the color change seen in (a) was not observed. The inset shows the setup where N2 gas was flown across the sample 
to displace the oxygen. (d) PL spectra from before and after energy was applied show no perceivable appearance 
of PL, suggesting the interlayer coupling was not affected. Thermal annealing experiments in SI.4 demonstrate 
applying heat in an oxygen environment disrupts the interlayer interaction, and that the other components in air 
(e.g. N2, H20, CO2) do not appear to affect the interlayer coupling. (e) PL spectra of a Bi2Se3/MoS2 2D heterostructure 
before  energy  was  applied,  as  well  as  after  several  consecutive  doses,  demonstrating  how  the  PL  intensity  is 
dependent on the total dose. 

Figure  2a  is  an  optical  image  of  a  Bi2Se3/MoS2  vertical  2D  heterostructure,  where  energy  was 

applied locally using a focused laser (168μW for 8 minutes), while the sample was in an oxygen-

present environment (i.e. air). The red arrow identifies the affected location, which underwent a 

change in color from purple to white. Figure 2b shows its PL spectra before and after the energy 

dose was applied. Characteristic B2Se3/MoS2 2D heterostructures do not have a PL, or only a very 

weak  PL,  because  the  interlayer  coupling  creates  a  non-radiative  recombination  path  for  the 

tightly-bound excitons that exist in the monolayer MoS2.[7] However, if energy is applied to the 

6 

 
 
 
heterostructure in the form of either thermal annealing or a laser, while  the heterostructure is in 

an O2-present environment, a PL spectrum emerges that corresponds to that of monolayer MoS2, 

suggesting  the  interlayer  coupling  was  disrupted  and  the  signature  MoS2  excitons  are 

recombining  along  radiative  pathways.  Atomic  force  microscope  (AFM)  measurements 

demonstrate that the Bi2Se3 remains on the MoS2 after a color change has been induced and the 

PL remerges, verifying that the change is not due simply to the removal of Bi2Se3 (SI.3). A different 

spot on the same sample (Figure 5c, yellow arrow) was exposed to the same power (168μW for 

12 minutes), while being continuously purged with N2 gas (inset Figure 5c), thereby removing 

oxygen from the vicinity of the exposed spot. We find that even with an increased laser dose (12 

min. vs. 8 min. exposure), there was neither a perceivable color change, nor emergence of the PL 

peak (Figure 5d), suggesting the interlayer coupling was not affected. Next, the atmosphere was 

switched  back  to  air  without  changing  the  laser  power  or  moving  the  sample  -  thereby  re-

introducing  oxygen  without  changing  the  specific  location  being  probed  -  resulting  in  a  color 

change and a strong PL peak recovery (SI.4b), confirming that oxygen plays a critical role in the 

observed  changes.  Detailed  investigations  in  different  gas  environments  in  SI.4  establish  that 

oxygen (O2), and not nitrogen, H2O vapor, or carbon dioxide, is required to induce the changes 

and  manipulate  the  interlayer  coupling.  Figure  2e  demonstrates  how  the  PL  intensity  is 

dependent  on  the  energy  dose  applied,  suggesting  that  the  interlayer  coupling  can  be 

manipulated in small increments. Later in the paper we demonstrate that the interlayer coupling 

can be tuned with high precision by controlling both the energy applied and the partial pressure 

of oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere. 

Photo-excited e-h pairs in mono-layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) form tightly-

bound  neutral  and  charged  excitons.[46]  In  direct-gap  monolayer  TMDs,  they  recombine 

radiatively, producing well-known PL spectra. In few-layered and thicker TMDs the quasiparticle 

band gaps are indirect, hence the KΓ indirect (non-radiative) recombination pathway becomes 

more favorable, resulting in progressively suppressed PL.[61] Indirect recombination in certain 

heterostructures  can  similarly  be  non-radiative,  if  the  excitons  formed  near  a 

-vector  in  the 

reciprocal  lattice  of  one  layer  finds  the  most  favorable  recombination  pathway  via  a  lower-

7 

k 
energy-state that is located at a different 

-point in the reciprocal lattice of the second layer. In 

all  the  as-grown  Bi2Se3/MoS2  2D  heterostructures,  the  PL  spectra  were  strongly  quenched, 

suggesting the interlayer coupling was inducing non-radiative recombination pathways for the 

excitons. Upon application of energy (either heat or laser) in an oxygen-present environment, all 

heterostructures  recovered  their  radiative  recombination  pathways,  suggesting  the  interlayer 

coupling  was  disrupted,  thereby  inducing  the  MoS2  layer  to  behave  more  electronically 

independent. Next we show that the PL can be quenched again by applying energy (via either 

thermal  annealing  or  laser  exposure)  in  an  O2-free  environment  (SI.4),  demonstrating  that  the 

effects could be reversed and the interlayer coupling restored. 

Figure 3. Tuning the interlayer coupling and photoluminescence intensity (a) Variation of PL intensity under 
alternating  air  and  nitrogen  environments  while  a  focused  laser  (i.e.  energy)  is  applied,  demonstrating  that  a 
nitrogen environment is able to restore the interlayer coupling. The solid black arrow shows how the baseline PL 
reading monotonically grows after repeated environment cycling, and the PL’s rate-of-change varies, suggesting 
the 2D heterostructure may not return to its initial (as-grown) state. The dashed blue arrow shows the overall PL 
intensity growth factor, up to 215×, achievable by this cycling approach. (b) Correlation between laser (i.e. energy) 
exposure (in air) and the resulting PL intensity of a Bi2Se3/MoS2 2D heterostructure using a calibrated recipe (50 
µW, 6  s doses  followed  by 1 µW, 60  s  for  collecting  data), demonstrating a  controlled  disruption  of  interlayer 
coupling. Under this dose recipe, the radiative recombination was found to grow approximately logarithmically, 
and a vast majority of exposures result in a <5% change in intensity (see inset). See also SI.5 for other possible 
behaviors when the recipe is changed. Inset: histogram of the change steps under each exposure. Both (a) and (b) 
taken together demonstrate an unprecedented degree of controlled manipulation of the interlayer coupling and 
PL achievable. Later we demonstrate this is possible in a site-selectable manner as well.

Remarkably, not only are we able to disrupt the interlayer coupling and increase the PL intensity 

using, but we can also restore the interlayer coupling and  decrease the PL intensity, which we 

believe is due to the intercalation and de-intercalation of oxygen. Figure 3a shows the change in 

PL intensity of a Bi2Se3/MoS2 2D heterostructure that is  oxygenated and deoxygenated several 

cycles  by  switching  the  ambient  atmosphere  between  air  and  nitrogen.  This  controllable 

switching  of  radiative  and  non-radiative  exciton  recombination  pathways,  demonstrates  the 

ability  to  both  disrupt  and  restore  the  interlayer  coupling.  This  process  can  be  cycled  several 

times, underscoring the fact that at the initial stage, under identical laser power, the oxygenation 

is reversed by the mere removal of the O2 partial pressure in the ambient. This indicates that at 

least initially, the oxygenation process is diffusive and does not form chemical bonds. After a few 

cycles,  the  maximum  PL  intensity  grows  by  as  much  as  215×  and  stops  quenching  fully, 

suggesting that other more permanent changes occur at higher energy dosage (discussed later in 

the paper). 

Figure 3b shows the variation of PL intensity measured after repeated doses (t=6s) of combined 

exposure to air (at ambient pressure) and laser power (at 50 µW). At this dose-value, the PL was 

found  to  grow  approximately  logarithmically  with  combined  exposure  (along  with  incident 

energy), suggesting the interlayer coupling can be tuned with high precision. The logarithmic 

shape is in agreement with Fick’s law of diffusion, which states the diffusion flux will decrease 

as  the  system  reaches  equilibrium,  and  whose  general  solution  has  an  exponential  form. 

Additionally,  Fick’s  law  has  been  used  to  describe  the  intercalation  process,  including  the 

intercalation  of  lithium  into  vertically  stacked  bilayer  graphene.[22]  The  inset  shows  that  the 

intensity-change  (IPL)  can  be  as  low  as~5%,  suggesting  possible  applications  as  low-cost 

atomically-thin laser calorimeters or photon-counters. SI.5 demonstrates other possible behaviors 

when the recipe is changed.

Figure  4.  DFT  calculations  predict  intercalated  O2  diminishes  interlayer  coupling  (a)  DFT  calculations  of  a 
rotationally aligned (i.e. twist angle is 0°) Bi2Se3/MoS2 superlattice predict significant charge redistribution into the 
interlayer  region,  and  an  influential  interlayer  coupling.  (b)  However,  when  O2  molecules  are  placed  in  the 
interface between the layers, DFT calculations predict the average interlayer separation increases from 3.57Å to 
4.18Å (17% increase), diminishing the interlayer coupling. These results are in agreement with previous studies 
where intercalated O2 between a 2D material and the substrate induces the 2D material to behave electronically 
independent (i.e. “freestanding”). Further, intercalation and de-intercalation are diffusion-dependent processes, 
offering an explanation for why the PL intensity rises and falls so quickly as the environment changes (Figure 3). 
DFT  calculations  predict  an  interlayer  separation  ~4.7  times  larger  than  the  diameter  of  an  oxygen  atom, 
suggesting sufficient space exists for O2 molecules to reside.  

The rapid changes observed in Figure 3 by simply switching the environment between air (i.e. O2-

present)  and  nitrogen  (i.e.  O2-absent)  suggest  that  oxygen  is  diffusing  in  and  out  of  the  2D 

heterostructure. As seen in Figure 4, the O2 molecule is relatively small compared to the interlayer 

spacing.  Further,  it  has  been  shown  that  O2  molecules  are  able  to  permeate  into  Bi2Se3, 

demonstrating they are able to fit between the atoms.[56], [57] Density functional theory (DFT) 

calculations  predict  that  the  interlayer  coupling  in  a  Bi2Se3/MoS2  2D  heterostructure  induces 

significant charge redistribution in the interlayer region, hybridizing nearest neighbor atoms to 

form bonds, and that it is influential in modifying the bandstructure.[7] Interestingly, when O2 

molecules  are  placed  in  the  interlayer  region,  DFT  calculations  predict  that  the  materials  will 

begin to separate, diminishing the interlayer coupling, and inducing the layers to behave more 

electronically  independent.  It  can  be  seen  in  Figure  4  that  the  interlayer  spacing  increases  on 

average  by  17%  when  five  O2  molecules  are  intercalated.  Together  these  results  hint  at  the 

interesting possibility that these atomically-thin layers may be excellent candidates for oxygen 

storage devices, potentially storing 69 kg/m3 (a factor of 52 times the density of O2 gas at 1 atm).

were “drawn” using different exposure times. (c) Fluorescence microscope image of the same sample (excitation

recombine  radiatively  (bright  regions)  or  non-radiatively  (dark  regions),  where  the  size  of  the  affected  area  is 
dependent  on  the  laser  spot  geometery  and  recipe  used  (i.e.  the  power  and  exposure  duration).  The  smallest 
“radiative”  regions  were  below  a  micron  in  diameter.  This  method  allows  for  the  rapid  manipulation  and 
measurement  of  the  interlayer  coupling  with  high  spatial  resolution,  facilitating  experiments  that  produce 
statistically significant results. 

Figure  5  demonstrates  a  low-cost  method  to  rapidly  and  precisely  manipulate  the  interlayer 

coupling  of  Bi2Se3/MoS2  2D  heterostructures  with  submicron  spatial  resolution.  Figure  5a  is  a 

schematic showing how a focused laser beam can be used to  apply calibrated energy doses to 

precisely manipulate the interlayer coupling with high (submicron) spatial resolution. Figure 5b 

shows the optical image where the method in Figure 5a was used to trace the letters “NEU” using 

different exposure times, demonstrating a facile method to manipulate the interlayer coupling. 

The laser-written sample was then imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Figure 5c, λex=488 

nm), demonstrating the ability to rapidly measure the degree of interlayer coupling disruption. 

The ability to rapidly write and read patterns with varying interlayer coupling strength, facilitates 

11 

 
 
 
 
  
experiments  that  produce  statistically  significant  results.  The  fluorescence  image  also 

demonstrates site-selective light emission with a spatial size close to that of the incident laser spot, 

enabling  photoluminescing  pixels  (PLPs)  tailored  down  to  sub-micron  diameters.  These  site-

programmable, color-selectable, atomically-thin, micron-scale PLPs (with effective volumes ~10-

21  m3)  are  attractive  for  optical  and  optoelectronic  applications  that  require  ultra-small  form-

factors.  

Bi2Se3 is well-known for its affinity to oxygen. ARPES measurements have shown that under very 

low  exposures  (<0.1  Langmuirs),  oxygen  inclusion  hole-dopes  ultraclean  Bi2Se3  samples.[55] 

However, the exposure level in our system is ~109 orders of magnitude larger, and so we don’t 

expect doping to be a dominant cause behind the observed switching of recombination pathways. 

Oxygen has been shown to react with Bi2Se3 and form new compounds, such as bismuth oxide; 

[56], [57] however, the reversible and diffusive behavior at lower exposure ranges suggests the 

formation of strong chemical bonds, or new materials, is unlikely. Additionally, AFM images of 

pre and post laser exposure in oxygen do not  show changes in the step height or topography, 

despite the fact the color changed and PL increased dramatically (SI.3b), suggesting the Bi2Se3 

was not chemically modified by oxygen.  Previous studies measured topographical changes in 

Bi2Se3 where oxygen modified the structure.[56] 

At  the  same  time,  oxygen  has  been  shown  to  easily  intercalate  between  2D  crystals  and  their 

substrates, decoupling the two materials and inducing them to behave more “freestanding” (i.e. 

electronically  independent).[31],  [32],  [48]–[52],  [62]  DFT  calculations  of  a  Bi2Se3/MoS2  2D 

heterostructure  predict  that  intercalated  O2  molecules  force  the  materials  apart,  enlarging  the 

interlayer  separation  by  17%,  thereby  diminishing  their  interlayer  hybridization  (SI.6). 

Furthermore, intercalation is a diffusive process that has been shown to be reversible,[31], [50]–

[52] which could explain why laser exposure in an O2-free environment is able to rapidly reverse 

the  changes.  The  2D  heterostructure  appears  to  have  memory  of  previous  laser  exposure  in 

oxygen, suggesting more permanent changes are taking place. We found the highly crystalline 

Bi2Se3  becomes  nano-  and  poly-crystalline  when  a  laser  is  applied  in  an  oxygen-present 

environment (SI.1).  O2 diffusion might be facilitated through the laser induced break-down of 

12 

 
Bi2Se3 into smaller grains (SI.1), and the subsequent increase in grain boundaries. A schematic 

explanation  of  the  possible  exciton  recombination  pathways  under  different  conditions  is 

summarized in SI.6. 

In conclusion,  the interlayer  coupling  in  vertically  stacked  2D  materials has  demonstrated  the 

ability  to  dramatically  alter  their  properties,  and  is  considered  a  promising  parameter  for 

designing  materials  with  tailored  capabilities.  The  Bi2Se3/MoS2  2D  heterostructure  an  ideal 

platform to study the interlayer interaction of 2D materials because it offers the ability to tune the 

interlayer coupling in-situ and with high-spatial resolution. From a fundamental perspective, in 

addition to rich excitonic physics, this system interplays strong spin-orbit coupling in non-centro-

symmetric crystal structures, and hence could potentially demonstrate novel correlated, spin and 

valley  physics.[63]–[65]  In  addition,  as  site-programmable,  color-selectable,  atomically-thin, 

micron-scale  and  intensity-tunable  photoluminescing  pixels  (PLPs),  this  system  could  be 

attractive for ultrathin and flexible optical information storage devices, color converters, micro-

cavity-lasers, and other photonic, plasmonic and optoelectronic applications.[66]–[69] The strong 

oxygen-selectivity of these heterostructures could also be potentially used as low-cost oxygen-

sensors and photon/power meters. We also showed data that suggested these materials could be 

used as O2 storage devices, potentially storing 69 kg/m3 (a factor of 52 times the density of O2 gas 

at 1 atm).

Methods  

Growth of monolayer MoS2 crystals  

13 

 
Monolayer  MoS2  was  grown  using  chemical  vapor  deposition  (CVD).[58]  The  growth  setup 

consisted  of  quartz  tubes  [1  inch  (2.54  cm)  in  diameter]  in  a  horizontal  tube  furnace 

(Lindberg/Blue M). A quartz boat, containing a thin layer of MoO2 powder (3 mg) with SiO2/Si 

(MTI Corporation) substrates suspended over the powder with the growth side facing down, was 

placed in the hot center of the furnace. Sulfur powder (150 mg) was placed near the insulating 

edge of the furnace upstream. The setup was pumped down and purged with argon gas before it 

was filled with an Ar atmosphere. Downstream was then opened to atmosphere, in addition to a 

constant 200 standard cubic centimeter per minute (SCCM) Ar flow. The furnace was heated to 

different temperatures and at variable rates, depending on the material being grown. The growth 

was conducted in two stages, 1st-stage and 2nd-stage, where 2nd stage would start once the 1st-stage 

temperature was reached. See the below table for material specific growth information. After the 

elapsed time, the furnace was opened and allowed to cool rapidly.

Bi2Se3 growth was performed in an identical CVD setup, except a heating wrap was coiled around 

the quartz  tube  at  the  down-stream end, leaving  no  gap between the furnace  and  the heating 

wrap. The Bi2Se3 powder (50 mg) was placed in the hot center of the furnace. The monolayer MoS2 

substrate  was  placed  downstream  ~0.75cm  from  the  boundary  between  the  furnace  and  the 

heating wrap. The system was pumped down to a base pressure of ~10 mtorr before a 35-SCCM 

Ar flow was introduced, raising the growth pressure to ~490 mtorr. The heating wrap was set to 

a temperature of 245°C, and a temperature controller (J-KEM Scientific Model Apollo) ensured it 

remained within ±2°C. The furnace was heated at a rate of 50°C/min to 530°C and then held there 

for 20-25 min depending on the desired thickness. Once growth was completed, the furnace was 

opened and the temperature controller was de-energized, allowing the setup to cool rapidly. 

Annealing experiments 

14 

 
 
All annealing experiments were performed between 240-245°C for 3 hours. All experiments used 

a flow rate of 3 SCCM, except the annealing under air, where no flow rate was used.  The five 

environments  were  pure  Ar,  pure  N2,  N2+H2Ovapor,  dry  air  (21%  O2  and  79%  N2),  and  air.  All 

setups,  except  N2+H2Ovapor,  were  pumped  down  and  filled  with  the  respective  gas  prior  to 

annealing.  The  N2+H2Ovapor  environment  was  created  by  flowing  N2  at  3  SCCM,  while  several 

boats with deionized H2O were present in the tube. The heating of the tube caused the H2O to 

evaporate. The downstream side “rained” significantly during the entire annealing process and 

H2O  was  still  present  in  most  of  the  boats,  verifying  that  sufficient  H2Ovapor  was  present 

throughout the annealing process. 

Device Fabrication  

Bi2Se3/MoS2 2D heterostructures grown on 285 nm Si/SiO2 were transferred to an identical chip, 

that had titanium/gold markers, by PMMA transfer method. First, PMMA C4 was spin coated at 

4000 rpm for 60 s and baked 180 C for 1:30 min. Then the chip was immersed in 1 M KOH solution 

for 4 hours.  Obtained PMMA  and  heterostructure film  transferred  to new  substrate.  This  was 

followed by acetone and IPA cleaning to remove PMMA residues.  

FET devices were made on 285 nm Si/SiO2 substrate by E-beam lithography using PMMA C4 or 

A4. The electrodes (5 nm Ti/50 nm Au) were deposited by e-beam evaporator with rate deposition 

1 and 3 Å/s, respectively. Lift off process was performed with acetone followed by IPA cleaning.  

Instrumentation  

Raman and PL spectra were measured using a Renishaw Raman microscope equipped with a 

488nm  laser  and  a  grating  of  1800  lines/mm.  A  ×100  or  ×150  objective  focused  the  laser  to 

diffraction-limited spot size. TEM images and SAED patterns were collected from a JEOL 2010F 

operated at 200 kV. AFM images were taken from a NanoMagnetics Instruments Ambient AFM. 

All Raman, PL, AFM, and UV-Vis experiments were performed under ambient condition. 

Computational Details 

15 

 
Ab initio calculations were carried out by using the pseudopotential projector augmented-wave 

(PAW) method [70] implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (vasp) [71], [72] with 

an energy cutoff of 420 eV for the plane-wave basis set. Exchange-correlation effects were treated 

using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [73], and van der Waals corrections were 

included using the DFT-D2 method of Grimme [74], where a 7x7x1 Γ-centered k-point mesh was 

used to sample the Brillouin zone. A large enough vacuum of 15 Å in the z-direction was used to 

ensure negligible interaction between the periodic images of the films. All the structures were 

relaxed using a conjugate gradient algorithm with an atomic force tolerance of 0.05 eV/Å and a 

total energy tolerance of 10−4eV. The spin-orbit coupling effects were included in a self-consistent 

manner.

The  distinct  dots  indicate  both  materials  are  highly  crystalline.  The  Bi2Se3  tends  to  grow  crystallographically 

aligned (i.e. twist angle is 0°). (b) A laser was applied while in an oxygen-present environment (i.e. air), and it was 

found to induce the Bi2Se3 to become nano- and poly-crystalline. As seen in Figure 3, at higher energy doses the 

system undergoes more robust changes that are not easily reversed. This is possibly due to the Bi2Se3 becoming 

nano-crystalline,  which  creates  more  grain  boundaries.  Oxygen  is  known  to  more  easily diffuse  through  grain 

boundaries (SI.##), which would explain the variation in the PL’s rate-of-change.

SI.4a. Table summarizing the changes induced depending on the energy delivery method and the environment. 
There  are  two  energy  delivery  methods  (Focused  laser  beam  and  Thermal  annealing),  and  five  different 
environments  (Air,  Dry  air,  Wet  N2,  N2,  and  Ar).  The  results  show  that  O2  is  required  to  switch  the  exciton 
recombination pathway from non-radiative to radiative.

spectra from the same spot before and after the air-laser-treatment, demonstrating the predicted behavior (i.e. PL 
recovery).  (c)  A  different  location  (orange  arrow)  on  the  same  sample  was  N2-laser-treated  by  flooding  the 
environment with N2 gas flow and displacing the air. N2-laser-treatment inhibits the color change observed in (a). 
Inset  shows  the  setup  used.  (d)  PL  spectra  from  before  and  after  N2-laser-treatment,  showing  no  perceivable 
appearance of PL after N2-laser-treatment. Laser-treatment and annealing experiments were separately performed 
in synthetic dry O2+N2 mixture and moisture-saturate N2 (SI.1) from which any role of the other components of air, 
e.g. N2, H20, CO2 could be eliminated. (e) The same spot in (c) was air-laser-treated. The color-change is perceivable, 
along with the appearance of the PL spectrum, shown in (f), demonstrating that extended N2-laser-treatment had 
no obvious deleterious effect on the switching of the exciton recombination pathways. (g) Comparison of air-laser-
treatment  vs.  N2-laser-treatment  using  a high-power  recipe.  The  PL  intensity  grew  over  an  order  of  magnitude 
under  air-laser-treatment,  compared  to  the  flat-growth  under  N2-laser-treatment.  (h)  Variation  of  PL  intensity 
under alternating air- and N2-laser-treatments, showing that N2-laser-treatment diminishes the PL intensity several 
decades. The solid black arrow shows how the baseline PL reading monotonically grows after repeated cycling of 
the  laser-treatments,  and  the  PL’s  rate-of-change  between  air-laser-treatments  varies,  suggesting  N2-laser-
treatment may not return the heterostructure to its as-grown state. The dashed blue arrow shows the overall PL 
intensity  growth  factor,  up  to  215×,  achievable  by  this  cycling  approach.  Taken  together,  this  demonstrates  an 
unprecedented degree of controlled manipulation of PL achievable in a site-selectable manner.

SI. 4d. 2D heterostructure annealed in dry air (i.e. 79% N2 + 21% O2). The behavior is similar to that of the air-
annealing experiments in that the PL intensity increases when dry-air-annealed and then decreases again after N2-
annealing. However, it is different in two subtle points: (1) after dry-air-annealing, air-laser-treatment does not 
affect the PL; and (2) a possible new PL signal emerges in the upper energies (~2.0eV), where the PL plateaus to a 
higher intensity than that seen at 1.7eV (i.e. the PL spectra is not symmetric, showing higher intensities at higher 
energies).  

29 

 
 
SI. 4e. 2D heterostructure annealed in an N2+H2Ovapor environment. This experiment established that water vapor 
does not react with the heterostructures to induce the optical and photoluminescence changes observed during air-
laser-treatment  in  air  (i.e.  water  vapor  is  not  necessary  to  switch  exciton  recombination  pathway).  In  fact,  the 
heterostructure will reverse both the air-laser-treatment induced optical and photoluminescence changes, when 
annealed in an N2 environment saturated with water vapor.  As seen above, five locations were air-laser-treated 
prior to annealing, and an optical change was induced in each on. Annealing reversed the optical change in all five 
spots. The two larger spots seen in the right two optical images were induced post-anneal, demonstrating it was 
still  possible  to  switch  the  recombination  pathway.  A  Bi2Se3/MoSe2-2xS2x  2D  heterostructure  was  used  above. 
Upcoming work will demonstrate that this can be accomplished on a family of monolayer TMDs.

how the air-annealed heterostructures appear a lighter shade of purple and have less contrast, compared to the as-
grown heterostructures. The heterostructures were then N2-annealed, resulting in the air-annealed optical changes 
being partially reversed (i.e. there is a darker shade of purple and more contrast). (Bottom PL spectra) Left to right

(specified by the red arrows). Air-annealed samples will have a brighter PL than the as-grown samples, but it will 
be  weaker  than a  laser-treated  as-grown  heterostructure.  The  PL  intensity  of  air-annealed  heterostructures  will 
decrease  when  air-laser-treated.  A  Bi2Se3/MoSe2-2xS2x  2D  heterostructure  was  used  above.  Upcoming  work  will

approximately  the  same  intensity;  however,  the  peak  blue-shifted.  The  PL  intensity  of  air-annealed 
heterostructures will decrease when air-laser-treated, which is the same behavior as in SI.1c.i. After N2-annealing, 
the PL will be quenched, and air-laser-treatment induces the PL upward, which is the same behavior observed in 
as-grown  heterostructures.  A  Bi2Se3/MoSe2-2xS2x  2D  heterostructure  was  used  above.  Upcoming  work  will

SI. 5. High Tunability and control of interlayer coupling and PL intensity. Rate of change of PL is dependent 
on the energy application recipe. A Bi2Se3/MoS2 crystal was air-laser-treated using five different recipes, where 
the power was held constant power, but time was changed. Different locations on the same Bi2Se3/MoS2 crystal 
were studied, allowing the results to be better compared. The results show that 6 sec. at 48.6µW produced the most 
consistent results.  

The difference in curve shapes is due to competing factors: too much air-laser-treatment results in degradation of 

the heterostructure; however, too little power does not induce sufficient change to be permanent. Additionally, 

using very low powers (~0.91µW) causes the PL intensity to decline. We believe this is because the powers perturb 

the  heterostructure  into  a  better  coupling,  which  squeezes  the  intercalated  oxygen  out.  It  has  been  shown 

previously that changing the interlayer coupling will change the rate of diffusion of oxygen intercalating between 

graphene and the surface (see [2] and SI.9).

Section 6 – Explanation of possible radiative and non-radiative exciton recombination pathways 

This family of 2D heterostructures has produced intriguing data that speaks both to the 

promising applications, as well as the complexity of the underlying science. There are a number 

of established mechanisms in peer-reviewed literature that may apply because they are in 

agreement with portions of the data. To the best of our knowledge, our system has multiple 

competing mechanisms that are taking place to produce the observed behavior. 

Below we describe the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of mechanisms that could be 

present, and then highlight the ones we believe play a primary role. To best convey our thought 

process, we list all the key observations (KOs), followed by the list of the mechanisms we 

believe could be present. 

Key Observations 

1.  The PL of the TMD is over 99% quenched when only one layer of Bi2Se3 is CVD grown on 
the TMD. One layer of Bi2Se3 is not thick enough to reflect or absorb the incoming and 
outgoing photons, meaning the Bi2se3 introduces a non-radiative electron-hole 
recombination path. 

2.  Several changes are induced from air-laser-treatment: 

a.  PL intensity will increase. 
b.  PL intensity can be precisely tuned (i.e. recovered with high control) over several 

c. 

orders of magnitude. 
 Affected regions undergo a perceived color change, appearing brighter and with 
less contrast, compared to as-grown heterostructures. 

d.  PL peak position is in the same location as the monolayer TMD’s PL peak 
position from pre-Bi2Se3 growth, strongly indicating that the recovered PL 
observed is from the excitons and trions in the TMD. This would indicate that 
air-laser-treatment removes the non-radiative electron-hole recombination 
pathway, allowing the excitons and trions to recombine at the K-point in the 
TMD, where it is direct bandgap. 

e.  Laser-treatment recipe (i.e. laser-power and time interval) will affect the rate of 

change of the PL intensity and peak position shift. 

3.  Air-laser-treatment changes can be spatial controlled with sub micrometer precision (i.e. 

the laser spot size). 

34 

 
 
 
 
4.  O2 is required to be present in the surrounding environment for changes to be induced, 

meaning it reacts with the heterostructures. 

5.  Air-laser-treatment induced changes can be reversed by thermally annealing or laser-

treating the heterostructure in an O2-free environment. 

6.  Bi2Se3/MoS2 heterostructures are p-type, and p-doped compared to pristine monolayer 

MoS2. 

7.  Air-laser-treating or annealing does not remove the Bi2Se3 from the surface, as seen by 

AFM scans. 

8.  Larger air-laser-treatment doses appear to induce permanent changes that make the 

heterostructure more sensitive in subsequent air-laser-treatments. 

9.  Bi2Se3 grows crystalline and with long-range order on the TMD, suggesting strong van 
der Waals epitaxy-mediated growth between the two component layers, and that they 
couple together. 

10.  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the Bi2Se3/MoS2 2D heterostructure 

predict that intercalated O2 molecules will increase the interlayer separation, disrupt the 
interlayer bonding, and diminish the interlayer interaction, thereby inducing the two 
materials to behave more “free-standing”. 

Exciton recombination pathways that may be present 

#1 –A straddled or staggered bandgap induces the photoluminescence quenching 

Well-coupled 2D heterostructures have been shown to have overlapping bandgaps,[75], [76] 

which we believe is happening when Bi2Se3 is grown on the TMDs, for reasons explained in key 

observation 9 (KO-9).  There are three different types of overlapping bandgaps: broken, 

straddled, and staggered. Device data showed that Bi2Se3/MoS2 is p-type, meaning the bandgap 

is not broken (broken bandgaps behave metallic), but is forming either a straddled or a 

staggered bandgap. All four TMD’s studied in this work are wide bandgap compared to Bi2Se3 

(>1.6eV to ~0.3eV),[55] meaning both a straddled and a staggered bandgap would introduce a 

non-radiative electron-hole recombination pathway. 

Mechanism #1 is in agreement with the PL quenching (KO-1) and why Bi2Se3/MoS2 is p-type 

(KO-6).  

35 

 
 
SI. 6a. Possible non-radiative electron-hole recombination pathways to explain the PL quenching observed in 

as-grown heterostructures. Both straddled and staggered bandgaps are in agreement with the data and explain 

the photoluminescence quenching observed because they introduce a non-radiative recombination pathway. 

Although a broken bandgap also has a non-radiative recombination pathway, it disagrees with KO-6; broken 

band gaps are metallic, whereas our device was p-type. 

#2 – O2 intercalates between TMD and Bi2Se3 and diminishes the interaction strength and 

coupling 

As the heterostructure is air-laser-treated, it undergoes numerous dramatic optical and PL 

changes; however, the Bi2Se3 is not removed (KO-7), as shown with AFM. We know that 

whatever the mechanism is, it is highly local (KO-3) and that O2 is required for the process (KO-

4). 

We believe that as the heterostructure is laser-treated or annealed in an O2-present 

environment, O2 intercalates into the interlayer spacing of the heterostructure (i.e. between the 

Bi2Se3 and TMD layers), where it disrupts the interlayer coupling, leading to the changes in 

properties observed. It has been shown that O2 intercalating between 2D materials and their 

surface decouples the 2D material, making quasi free-standing.[31], [32], [49]–[52], [77] In this 

case, it decouples the materials, allowing the TMD to regain the radiative recombination 

pathway. 

Additionally, each O2 molecule is only able to disrupt the interlayer coupling locally, meaning 

the amount of disruption in a certain area is dependent on the number of O2 molecules; the 

more O2 there is, the greater the interlayer coupling disruption. This mechanism (or radiative 

recombination pathway) is in agreement with numerous key observations, stated below:  

36 

 
 
 
KO-2a & KO-2d: As the interlayer coupling is disrupted, the non-radiative e-h recombination 

path will no longer be allowed, permitting e-h excitonic pairs to radiatively recombine in the 

TMD. 

KO-2b: The amount of recovery is dependent on the amount of O2 that intercalates, explaining 

the high control. 

KO-f: Changing the air-laser-treatment recipe will affect the diffusion of O2, thereby affecting 

the rate of change. 

KO-e: As O2 diffuses into the interlayer region, the environment surrounding the TMD will 

change, thereby altering the surrounding dielectric constant. All exciton quasiparticles emit 

electric field lines that affect the quasiparticle’s properties, and in 2D materials, these lines exist 

outside of the material, making the excitons and trions highly sensitive to the surrounding 

environment. By increasing the dielectric constant, one increases the binding energy, thereby 

lowering the peak position.[46] 

KO-c: The perceived color change indicates the material is becoming more transparent, which 

could be because the interlayer bandgap is removed as the materials decouple. 

KO-5: The changes can be reversed by annealing in an O2 free environment because the O2 

molecules diffuse out. 

KO-8: It has been shown that as Bi2Se3 is air-laser-treated, the Bi2Se3 will break-up into small 

grains. It is likely that increasing the number of grain boundaries increases the rate of O2 

diffusion, a fact that has been shown previously for graphene and silicene on various metal 

substrates.[31], [32], [49], [50], [52], [77] 

KO-10: DFT calculations predict intercalated O2 will disrupt the interlayer interaction.  

37 

 
SI. 6b. DFT calculations comparing a Bi2Se/MoS2 superlattice with and without O2 intercalated. The calculations predict that O2 

intercalation will increase the interlayer separation, disrupt the interlayer bonding, and diminish the interlayer interaction. Note 

how  the  interlayer  separation  increases  after  adding  O2  molecules,  going  from  an  average  separation  of  3.57Å  to  an  average 

separation of 4.18Å, a 17% increase. Interestingly, the O2 molecules create an uneven landscape of selenium atoms at the interface, 

pushing different atoms to different separation values. The above 2D heterostructure is rotationally aligned (i.e. twist angle is 0°), 

where 3 Bi2Se3 unit cells are the same length as 4 MoS2 unit cells. 

38 

 
SI. 6c. DFT calculations showing the location of the O2. These atomically-thin layers may be excellent candidates for oxygen storage 

devices, potentially storing 69 kg/m3 ¬(a factor of 52 times the density of O2 gas at 1 atm). The Bi2Se3/MoS2 superlattice has a predicted 

volume of 1.936nm3 (1.247x1.086x1.43 nm), and the combined mass of five O2 molecules is 1.328x10-25 kg, yielding a density of 68.6 

kg/m3.
