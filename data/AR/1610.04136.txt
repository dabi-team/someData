Abstract 

In  the  present  work,  extended  Argon  ion  bombardment  was  used  to  modify  anatase 

TiO2 nanotube (NTs) layers. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a high 
content of sub-oxide formed (Ti3+, Ti2+ states) in the nanotube layers. These samples 

were  tested  for  their  ability  to  show  open-circuit  photocatalytic  hydrogen  evolution. 

We found for UV (cw laser 325nm) illumination as well as for AM1.5 conditions, a 

strongly  enhanced  H2  evolution  activity 

in  absence  of 

the  usual  noble 

metal-nanoparticle decoration. We conclude therefore that these sub-oxide states can 

play an important role in the activation of TiO2 nanotubes - namely as a H2 evolution 

co-catalyst.

Introduction 

In  1971,  Fujishima  and  Honda  reported  on  the  use  of  a  TiO2  for  triggering 

photocatalytic reactions, i.e. by shining light of an energy higher than the band gap of 

the semiconductive TiO2 (3.2 eV for anatase or 3.0 eV for rutile) electron-hole pairs 

are generated that then may trigger red-ox processes with the environment [1]. Due to 

the relative position of  TiO2 valence and conduction band  with  respect  to important 

red-ox  potentials  (namely  water),  a  wide  range  of  useful  red-ox  processes  are 

thermodynamically  feasible  [2,3].  This  may  involve  hole  transfer  for  oxidative 

photocatalytic destruction of pollutants or electron transfer to generate H2 from H2O 

[4,5]. In general, photocatalytic reactions are preferably carried out on large specific 

surface  area  TiO2  entities  such  as  nanoparticle  suspensions  [6,7]  or  nanostructured 

electrodes  [8-10].  Most  recently,  particularly  self-organized  TiO2  nanotube  arrays 

have  received  considerable  attention  for  photocatalysis  because  of  their  unique 

combination of geometry with favorable charge-separation properties [11-15]. 

One of the most desired photocatalytic reactions is the generation of H2 and O2 from 

water. The reaction is generally however very sluggish on the bare TiO2 surface, and 

therefore adequate co-catalysts (noble-metals such as Au, Pt, Pd [16-20]) are needed 

to achieve considerable reaction rates. Recently, it was however reported that anatase 

TiO2  nanotube  layers  after  a  treatment  in  H2  under  high  pressure  conditions  are 

activated  to  provide  considerable  open  circuit  hydrogen  evolution  rates,  i.e. 

hydrogenation seems to be able to provide specific intrinsic co-catalytic activation of 

anatase  nanotubes  and  thus  enable  considerable  co-catalyst  free  H2  evolution  rates 

[21]. The work further investigated  also common reduction treatments [17,22-25] of 

TiO2 such as Ar, or Ar/H2 annealing under elevated temperatures, but these treatments 

were found not  to  induce any co-catalytic  effect [21].  In the present  work we show, 
however  that  TiO2  nanotube  layers  that  are  exposed  to  Ar+  -ion  sputtering  show  a 

considerably  enhanced  hydrogen  production  rate  that  can  directly  be  attributed  to 
ion-beam generated sub-oxide states (Ti3+/Ti2+).

Experimental section 

TiO2  nanotubes  (NTs)  were  grown  by  anodization  of  titanium  foils  (0.125mm 

thickness,  Advent,  purity  99.6+%)  in  ethylene  glycol  (EG,  Sigma–Aldrich),  water 

(1M)  and  NH4F  (0.2M,  Sigma–Aldrich,  98%)  electrolyte  at  60V  (power  supply, 

VOLTRAFT  VLP2403Pro)  for  20  min  in  a  two  electrode  configuration  using  a 

platinum counter electrode. Before anodization, the Ti foils were degreased in acetone 

and  ethanol  by  sonication,  respectively,  rinsed  with  deionized  water,  and  dried  in 

nitrogen atmosphere. In order to convert the amorphous tube layer to anatase, thermal 

annealing was performed in air using rapid thermal annealer (Jipelec JetFirst 100) at 

450 ̊C for 1h with a temperature ramp rate of 0.5 ̊C/s.     

X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, PHI 5600 XPS spectrometer, US)  was used 
for  ion  bombardment,  Ar+-ion  sputtering  and  compositional  analysis  at  the  sample. 

For  bombardment,  the  crystallized  TiO2  NTs  were  exposed  to  argon  ion  beam 

sputtering  (3.5kV,  current  density  15mA).  The  sputtered  sample  area  was  5×5mm, 

sputtering  was  carried  out  using  a  sequence  of  10min  sputtering  followed  by  30s 

spectra acquisition. The incident angle of Argon beam on the surface of TiO2 NTs is 
36o  –  this  corresponds  to  a  nominal  sputter  rate  of  0.85nm/min  on  a  SiO2  reference 

layer. XPS spectra were acquired using monochromatic X-rays with a pass energy of 

23.5eV. All the XPS element peaks are shifted to the Ti2p standard position.   

For morphological  characterization  of the  TiO2  NT layers, we used  a  field  emission 

scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S4800). XRD patterns of the crystallized TiO2 

NTs were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (X’pert Philips PMD diffractometer) 

with a Panalytical X’celerator detector and CuKa radiation (λ = 1.54056Å).   

For open circuit photocatalytic H2 evolution measurements we immersed the TiO2 NT 

layers  in  an  aqueous  ethanol  (20  vol%)  solution  and  illuminated  the  surface  either 
with a 325nm cw-HeCd laser (60 mW/cm2, 200mW, Kimmon, Japan) or  an AM 1.5 
(100  mW/cm2)  solar  simulator  for  12h,  respectively.  A  gas  chromatograph 

(GCMS-QO2010SE, SHIMADZU) with TCD detector was used to obtain the amount 

of generated H2 for different TiO2 NTs samples.

Results and discussion 
In order to generate and quantify Ar+-ion bombardment effects (namely inducing the 
reduction  of  TiO2  to  Ti3+),  we  carried  out  these  steps  in  the  UHV  of  an  XPS.  Ti 

sub-oxides  are  reported  to  be  very  sensitive  to  environmental  exposure  [26,27],  this 

guaranteed an identical modified starting point for further investigations. The samples 

were  then  transferred  to  photocatalytic  H2  evolution  measurements.  After  these 

measurements the sample sub-oxide status was then reassessed by XPS and a number 
of reference experiments (such as exposing Ar+ bombarded samples to ambient) were 

carried out.   

Fig  1a  shows  SEM  images  of  the  nanotube  layers  used  in  this  work  after  anodic 

growth  in  a  NH4F/H2O/ethylene  glycol  electrolyte  and  after  the  samples  were  air 

annealed  at  450°C  to  transform  the  samples  to  anatase.  From  Fig.  1a  and  b  it  is 

apparent  that  the  tubes  have  a  diameter  of  85  nm  in  average  and  a  length  (layer 
thickness of 6.6µm). After Ar+ -ion sputtering for 5h, as described in the experimental 
section, the tube morphology at the top of the layer shows typical Ar+ -ion sputtering 

marks (Figure 1c). The sputter conditions used correspond to a nominal removal of a 

compact TiO2 layer of 255 nm from the top. As apparent from the cross section SEM, 

the  layer  thickness  was  indeed  diminished  by  the  sputter  process  only  by  0.24  µm 

(Figure 1b and d). XRD in  Figure  1e shows that the overall anatase  structure of  the 
TiO2 nanotubes remained after 5h Ar+ -ion bombardment.   
From XPS spectra that were acquired before (Fig.2a) and after Ar+ -ion bombardment 

(Fig. 2b-d), clear alterations in the Ti2p peak as well as in the O1s peak are apparent 

after  sputtering.  By  fitting  of  the  Ti2p  peaks  according  to  literature  [28],  the 
individual  peaks  can  be  ascribed  to  Ti4+  at  463.6eV  (Ti2p1/2)  and  457.9eV  (Ti2p3/2), 
Ti3+ at 461.8eV (Ti2p1/2) and 456.1eV (Ti2p3/2), Ti2+ at 459.9eV (Ti2p1/2) and 454.1eV 

(Ti2p3/2).  Compared  to  Ti2p  before  ion  bombardment,  an  obvious  increase  of 

sub-oxide  peaks  is  evident  from  Figure  2b  and  2c.  For  TiO2  NTs  after  50min 
sputtering, the measured contents are 43.85% for Ti4+,    32.23% for Ti3+ and 23.92% 
for Ti2+, for TiO2 NTs after 5h sputtering, Ti2+ rises to 41.77%, Ti3+ to 29.30%, and 
Ti4+ drops to 28.93%, respectively. Also a significant alteration of the O1s peak can be 

observed  with  a  shift  in  the  maximum  from  529.1eV  to  529.9eV  and  strong 

contributions  at  higher  binding  energies  (Figure  2d),  which  is  well  in  line  with  the 

formation of sub-oxides in the TiO2 NTs.

Surface Ti3+ is susceptible to air exposure as evident from XPS spectra taken after the 

samples  were  removed  from  the  XPS  environment  and  reintroduced  after  being 

exposed to  air  (for  2  h  or 7 days). Clearly exposure to  air for 2 h  leads  to  a drastic 
re-oxidation  of  the  samples:  the  measured  Ti2+  content  decreases  from  41.77%  to 
7.79%, the Ti3+ content from 29.30% to 7.66% (Figure 2e), and accordingly the partial 

re-oxidation is also apparent from a shift of O1s peak from 530.1eV to 529.4eV. After 

exposure  for  7  days  in  air,  the  sub-oxide  species  reach  a  1%  level,  i.e.  as  shown  in 

inset of Figure 2e. Quantitative experimental data are compiled (Table 1f) in Fig.1. 

Figure 3 shows the observed hydrogen evolution rate of the bare TiO2 NTs and after 
they have been exposed to Ar+ sputtering measured under open circuit conditions in a 

20  vol%  ethanol/DI  water  solution.  For  the  sputtered  samples,  clearly  more  H2  is 
generated both under UV laser and AM1.5 illumination, i.e. for the Ar+ bombardment 

TiO2  NTs  under  plain  UV  illumination,  the  amount  of  H2  is  2-fold  that  of  the  bare 

TiO2  NTs  after  the  same  time  illumination.  For  AM1.5  illumination,  for  the 

non-treated tubes there is no significant H2 evolution detectable, whereas clearly the 

sub-oxide containing sample shows obvious H2 evolution.     

In order to assess how much the results are affected by environmental deterioration of 

the sub-oxide content, we additionally investigated samples that were exposed to air 

for 2 h and 7 days (Figs.2e and f) for their H2 evolution performance (Fig.3b). Clearly 

the sample exposed for 2 h to air still shows a H2 evolution activity comparable to a 

fresh sample, while for the sample exposed for 7 days to air, the activity has virtually 

returned  to  the  untreated  TiO2  nanotube  samples.  This  clearly  shows  that  the  H2 

evolution  photocatalytic  activity  is  related  to  the  presence  of  sub-oxide  states 
(Ti3+/Ti2+).  However,  it  is  very  interesting  to  note  that  the  sample  after  2  h  air 
exposure shows a drastic drop in XPS-accessible Ti3+/2+ (from 29.30 % to 7.66% for 
Ti3+,  and  41.77%  to  7.79%  for  Ti2+,  respectively),  while  the  H2  activity  remains 
(within the error of detection) almost unaffected. This may indicate that Ti3+/2+ also in 

much  lower  concentrations  than  observed  directly  after  sputtering  provide  sufficient 

co-catalytic centers to be not rate determining. On the other hand, it may indicate that 
Ti3+  centers  that  are  buried  [i.e.,  are  not  directly  on  the  surface  (XPS  penetration 

depth)] may contribute to activity. Nevertheless, if re-oxidation of the samples is too 

extended they may be buried too deep to be effective. 

In the light of recently reported effects of a high temperature hydrogenation of TiO2 

4 

NTs on the creation of a stable co-catalytic center for photocatalytic open circuit H2 

evolution [21], the present work allows same conclusions. It is shown that sub-oxide 
(Ti3+/2+)  states  can  represent  a  co-catalytic  center  for  H2  evolution  and  may  thus 

constitute  a  partial  explanation  for  such  findings.  Nevertheless,  in  contrast  to 
hydrogenation, the co-catalytic effect produced by Ar+ -ion bombardment is not stable, 

i.e. it fades out by environmental interactions. 

Overall  it  can  thus  be  concluded  that  Ti-sub-oxide  states  can  represent  co-catalytic 

centers  that  allow  an  enhanced  photocatalytic  hydrogen  evolution  from  TiO2 

nanotubes. In order to make the co-catalytic effect “permanent”, a passivation of these 

states is required as it is possibly provided by hydrogenation.   

Conclusions 
The  present  work  shows  that  Ar+  -ion  bombardment  creates  sub-oxide  states  in  the 

oxide of TiO2 nanotubes that beneficially affect the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution 

rate  under  open  circuit  conditions.  The  finding  thus  may  open  new  perspectives  of 

replacing noble metal co-catalysts in photocatalytic water splitting.
