The search for experimental signatures of the critical point (CP) of
strongly interacting matter
the
is one of
NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN SPS. In the course of the experiment, a
beam momentum and system size scan is performed. Local proton density
ﬂuctuations in transverse momentum space represent an order parameter of
the chiral phase transition and are expected to scale according to a univer-
sal power-law in the vicinity of the CP; we probe their behavior through
an intermittency analysis of the proton second scaled factorial moments
(SSFMs) in transverse momentum space. Previous such analyses revealed
power-law behavior in NA49 Si+Si collisions at 158A GeV/c, with no in-
termittency observed in lighter or heavier NA49 & NA61/SHINE systems
at the same energy. We now extend the analysis to NA61/SHINE Ar+Sc
collisions at 150A GeV/c, similar in size and baryochemical potential to
NA49 Si+Si. We employ statistical techniques to subtract non-critical
background and estimate statistical and systematic uncertainties. Subse-
quently, we use Monte Carlo simulations to assess the statistical signiﬁcance
of the observed intermittency eﬀect.

(13A – 150A GeV/c) and system size (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La)
of colliding nuclei, thus probing diﬀerent freeze-out conditions in tempera-
ture T and baryochemical potential µB (Fig.1 left).

and temperature T . Right: Theoretical studies predict the presence of a “hill
of ﬂuctuations” as a function of colliding system size and energy, for observables
sensitive to the CP (see Ref.[2] for more details).

Near the CP, a second order phase transition occurs; the correlation
length of the system diverges, leading to a scale-invariant system and an
expected “hill” of increased ﬂuctuations in various observables in the CP
vicinity (Fig.1 right). Of particular interest are local power-law ﬂuctuations
of the net baryon density [3], connected to the order parameter of the QCD
chiral phase transition, the chiral condensate. At ﬁnite baryochemical po-
tential, critical ﬂuctuations are also transferred to the net proton density, as
well as to the proton and antiproton densities separately [3, 4]. At the CP,
the ﬂuctuations of the order parameter are self-similar [5], belonging to the
3D-Ising universality class, and can be detected in transverse momentum
space within the framework of a proton intermittency analysis [3, 6] by use
of scaled factorial moments (SFMs). A detailed analysis can be found in
Ref. [7], where we study various heavy nuclei collision datasets recorded in
sN N ≈ 17 GeV)
the NA49 experiment at maximum energy (158A GeV/c,
of the SPS (CERN).

2. Method of intermittency analysis

Intermittency is deﬁned as power-law scaling of the Second Scaled Fac-
torial Moments (SSFMs) of protons as a function of bin size in transverse
momentum space. The SSFMs are calculated by partitioning a region of
transverse momentum space into a lattice of M × M equal-size bins, and
counting the number of proton pairs per bin:

where ni is the number of particles in the i-th bin and M 2 is the total
number of bins, and we average over bins and events ((cid:104). . .(cid:105)). In the case
of a pure system exhibiting critical ﬂuctuations, F2(M ) is expected to scale
with M , for large values of M , as a power-law:

F2(M ) ∼ M 2φ2, φ2 = φB

2,cr = 5/6

(2)

where φ2 is the intermittency index, and provided the freeze-out occurs
exactly at the critical point [3].

Noisy experimental data require the subtraction of a background of un-
correlated & misidentiﬁed protons, which is achieved through the construc-
tion of correlation-free mixed events. A correlator ∆F2(M ) can then be
deﬁned in terms of the moments of data and mixed events. In the special
case where the background dominates over the critical component, Monte
Carlo simulations indicate we can approximate the correlator as:

∆F (e)

2 (M ) (cid:39) F (d)

2

(M ) − F (m)

2

(M ),

(3)

where mixed event (m) moments are simply subtracted from data (d) mo-
ments [7]. ∆F2(M ) should then scale as a power law, ∆F2(M ) ∼ M 2φ2,
in a limited range, with the same intermittency index as the pure critical
system.

SSFMs statistical errors are estimated by the bootstrap method [8, 9],
whereby the original set of events is resampled with replacement [7]. Fitting
∆F (e)
2 (M ) to obtain φ2 conﬁdence intervals is complicated by bin correla-
tions among M -values. The matter is under current investigation.

A proton generating modiﬁcation of the Critical Monte Carlo (CMC)
code [3] is used to simulate a system of critically correlated protons, which
are mixed with a non-critical background to study the eﬀects on the quality
of intermittency analysis.

3. Results

Proton intermittency analysis was ﬁrst performed on data collected by
the NA49 experiment [7]. Three collisions systems of diﬀerent size were
analyzed: C+C, Si+Si and Pb+Pb at mid-rapidity, at the maximum SPS
energy of 158A GeV/c. Fig.2(a-c) shows the correlator ∆F2(M ) as a func-
tion of bin size M for the analyzed systems. No intermittency was detected
in C+C and Pb+Pb; by contrast, the Si+Si system exhibits power-law

ﬂuctuations compatible with criticality, with an intermittency index value
estimated, through the bootstrap, as φ2,B = 0.96+0.38
−0.25(stat.)±0.16(syst.) [7].
Motivated by the positive NA49 Si+Si result, an intermittency analysis
was performed on the NA61/SHINE 7Be + 9Be [10] and 40Ar + 45Sc [11]
systems at 150A GeV/c. Results for the correlator ∆F2(M ) are presented
in Fig.3. In the case of Be+Be system, Fig.3(a), ∆F2(M ) values ﬂuctuate
around zero, and no intermittency eﬀect is observed. The result is, how-
ever, inconclusive as to criticality, due to the low proton multiplicity of the
system.

The Ar+Sc analysis presented here supersedes the older preliminary
analysis shown in [11], as it is based on higher statistics. A scan was per-
formed in centrality, as determined by projectile spectator energy; 5% and
10% centrality intervals, as well as the full 0-20% range, were examined.
Selected proton purity was 90% or higher. Results are shown in Fig.3(b-h).
The scaling eﬀect is weaker, but still consistent, with the earlier analysis;
we see a weak indication of intermittency for peripheral collisions (10-15%),
improving in quality for the wider 10-20% interval. Reliable φ2 conﬁdence
intervals cannot currently be obtained through simple power-law ﬁts due
to bin correlations of M values; the solid red lines in Fig.3(b-h) are simply
power-law scaling functions to guide the eye.

Pb+Pb collisions (0-10% most central) at 158A GeV/c (Ref.[7]).

As mentioned, the uncertainties involved in the ∆F2(M ) calculation are
large; we therefore attempt to quantify the statistical signiﬁcance of the non-
zero eﬀect we see in NA61/SHINE Ar+Sc @ 150A GeV/c data by looking
at the bootstrap distributions of ∆F2(M ) values.

Figure 4 (left) shows the values of ∆F2(M ) for 10-20% central Ar+Sc
collisions at 150A GeV/c; original sample data values and their bootstrap
standard errors are plotted against conﬁdence intervals (68-95-99.7%) of the
∆F2(M )
samples.
Figure 4 (right) compares the experimental ∆F2(M ) values against the

that random background can imitate an eﬀect as large as seen in Ar+Sc
in about ∼ 5 − 15% of all cases, and the Ar+Sc eﬀect is above zero in
∼ 85 − 95% of bootstrap samples. Based on these ﬁndings, we tentatively
assign a 85% statistical signiﬁcance to the observed experimental result be-
ing not a purely random ﬂuctuation.

4. Summary and conclusions

Intermittency analysis of proton density ﬂuctuations in transverse mo-
mentum space provides us with a promising set of observables for the detec-
tion of the critical point of strongly interacting matter. NA49 Si+Si inter-
mittency analysis at the maximum SPS energy estimates an intermittency
index overlapping with the critical QCD prediction, whereas no intermit-
tency is observed in either the smaller C+C or the larger Pb+Pb system at
the same collision energy. Preliminary analysis of the NA61/SHINE central
Be+Be system at 150A GeV/c, consistently, shows no positive result.

We see a ﬁrst weak indication of a non-trivial intermittency eﬀect in
NA61/SHINE, in our preliminary analysis of the SSFMs ∆F2(M ) of Ar+Sc
collisions at 150A GeV/c. The signiﬁcance of the eﬀect seems to increase
for less central collisions in the case of proton purity thresholds of 90% and
above. However, due to the magnitude of SSFMs uncertainties, and the fact
that F2(M ) values for distinct M are correlated, the quality of ∆F2(M )
power-law scaling remains still to be established, and an estimation of φ2
conﬁdence intervals is still pending.
