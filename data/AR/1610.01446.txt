Abstract Antibiotic-resistant bacteria has posed a grave threat to public health by causing
a number of nosocomial infections in hospitals. Mathematical models have been used to study
the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within a hospital and the measures to control
antibiotic resistance in nosocomial pathogens. Studies presented in [4, 5] have shown great
value in understanding the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a hospital. However,
their results are limited to numerical simulations of a few diﬀerent scenarios without analytical
analysis of the models in all biologically feasible parameter regions. Bifurcation analysis and
identiﬁcation of the global stability conditions are necessary to assess the interventions which
are proposed to limit nosocomial infection and stem the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
In this paper we study the global dynamics of the mathematical model of antibiotic resistance
in hospitals in [4, 5]. The invasion reproduction number Rar of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is
introduced. We give the relationship of Rar and two control reproduction numbers of sensitive
bacteria and resistant bacteria (Rsc and Rrc). More importantly, we prove that a backward bi-
furcation may occur at Rar = 1 when the model includes superinfection which is not mentioned
in [5]. That is, there exists a new threshold Rc
ar < Rar < 1, then the system can
have two interior equilibria and it supports an interesting bistable phenomenon. This provides
critical information on controlling the antibiotic-resistance in a hospital.

Bifurcation and dynamics of a model of antibiotic resistance

In general, patients with infections are at higher risk of worse clinical outcomes and
even death, and they also consume more healthcare resources.
It is one of the pre-
eminent public health concerns in the 21st century. Mathematical models have made
substantial contributions to explain antibiotic resistance in hospitals as they provide
quantitative criteria to evaluate the interventions to control nosocomial infection and
stem the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

There has been a substantial amount of work devoted to understanding the dy-
namics of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, see for instance [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9].
Lipsitch et al.
[4] proposed a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of
antibiotic-resistant and sensitive strains of a type of bacteria in a hospital or a unit of
hospital. They studied the transmission dynamics of these two strains and the use of
two antimicrobial agents referred to drug 1 and drug 2, and assumed that the bacte-
ria may be sensitive or resistance to drug 1, but all bacteria were sensitive to drug 2.
The authors predicted the transmission dynamics of resistant and sensitive nosocomial
pathogens, and suggested criteria for measuring the eﬀectiveness of interventions to
reduce resistance in hospitals based on an ODEs model. With numerical simulations,
they predicted how the prevalence of resistant bacteria changes over time under various
interventions. Furthermore, the same authors extended the model in [5] by allowing
superinfection, which is ignored in [4]. The results in [4, 5] are limited to numerical
analysis. However, analytical studies of the models are necessary to provide a full
assessment of possible interventions.

We provided analytical analysis of the model [5] in this paper. The model considers
two strains of a single bacterial species with two antimicrobial agents referred to drug
1 and drug 2. Individuals may carry strains of these bacteria that are either sensitive
(S) or resistant (R) to drug 1, or they may be free of these bacteria (X); here, X,
S, and R are the frequencies of the diﬀerent host states as well as their designations.
The schematic diagram Figure 1 leads to the following system of ordinary diﬀerential
equations [5]:

dS
dt
dR
dt
dX
dt

= mµ + βSX − (τ1 + τ2 + γ + µ)S + σβcSR,

= β(1 − c)RX − (µ + τ2 + γ)R − σβcSR,

(1.1)

= (1 − m)µ + (τ1 + τ2 + γ)S + (τ2 + γ)R − βSX − β(1 − c)RX − µX.

The parameters in the model are explained in Table 1. If σ = 0, then the superinfection
is ignored and system (1.1) is the model studied in [4].

Note that S +R +X = 1. The model (1.1) can be simpliﬁed to an equivalent planar
diﬀerential system (1.2) by substituting X = 1 − S − R into the ﬁrst two equations of
system (1.1),

Figure 1: A compartment model of bacterial transmission dynamics in a hospital set-
ting. This ﬁgure is adopted from [5], and we reverse the arrows from S to R. The
correction has been conﬁrmed by the authors of [5] in the private mail.

In this paper we analytically studied system (1.2) instead of system (1.1). We
obtained the invasion reproduction number Rar of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and
introduced the connection between Rar and Rsc and Rrc, which are the control re-
production numbers of sensitive bacteria and resistant bacteria. It is of great value in
measuring the eﬀectiveness of interventions to reduce resistance in hospitals. One of
important ﬁndings in our paper is that backward bifurcation may occur when super-
infection is included which is impossible in the model without superinfection. When
the backward bifurcation arises, it supports an interesting bistable phenomenon and
provides important information on explanation of antibiotic-resistant controls. More-
over, we get the global dynamics for all parameter cases. Numerical simulations help
to verify the analytical results obtained. Some measures can be taken to control the
transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, for example, isolation of patients with in-
fections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, properly increased use of drug 2, etc.
Sensitivity analysis of the model based on Latin Hypercube Sampling shows that the
treatment of drug 1 (τ1) has the most important inﬂuence on the frequency of patients
colonized with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and they are positively correlated. Thus,
it needs to be more cautious to use drug 1.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the studies
on the invasion reproduction number Rar of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the bifurca-
tion analysis and the global dynamics of the model for diﬀerent parameter conditions.
We give some numerical analysis about the backward bifurcation and dependence on
parameters in section 3. Discussions are provided in section 4. Finally, some detailed
proofs and the global dynamics of the model when m = 0 are given in the Appendix

2 Model analysis

In what follows we will study system (1.2) to obtain the global dynamics of system

(1.1).

Note that S and R are the frequencies of diﬀerent host states. It is suﬃcient to

consider the dynamics of system (1.2) on the following closed region:

Ω = {(S, R)|0 ≤ S ≤ 1, 0 ≤ R ≤ 1 − S}.

(2.1)

Moreover, we have the following proposition on Ω:

Proposition 2.1. For system (1.2), the set Ω, deﬁned in (2.1), is positively invariant.
That is to say, all solutions through a point in Ω stay in Ω for all t ≥ 0.

The proof of Proposition 2.1 is given in the Appendix.

Before the analysis of the model, we introduce two important control reproduc-
tion numbers, which is closely related with the invasion reproduction number and the
dynamics of system (1.2).

In a hypothetical institution where all individuals enter uncolonized (m = 0), the

control reproduction number of the sensitive bacteria is deﬁned as

and the control reproduction number of the resistant bacteria is deﬁned as

Rsc =

β
τ1 + τ2 + γ + µ

,

Rrc =

β(1 − c)
τ2 + γ + µ

.

(2.2)

(2.3)

They respectively represent the number of secondary infections produced by an infec-
tious individual colonized with the sensitive bacteria and by an infectious individual
colonized with the resistant bacteria during the respective infectious period, when in-
troduced in a population uncolonized.

The global dynamics of system (1.2) when m > 0 is very diﬀerent from the case
m = 0. In the present paper, we mainly focus on the case m > 0 and give the global
dynamics of system (1.2) when m = 0 in the Appendix for reference and comparison.

2.1 Resistance-free equilibrium and invasion reproduction number

In this subsection, we study the resistance-free equilibrium of system (1.2) and get

the invasion reproduction number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

It is easy to verify that system (1.2) has a unique boundary equilibrium, i.e., the

resistance-free equilibrium E∗

0 (S0, 0), where S0 is the positive root of the equation

βS2 + (τ1 + τ2 + γ + µ − β)S − mµ = 0,

given by

S0 =

(2.5)

It follows from m ∈ (0, 1] that S0 ∈ (0, 1), and thus it is biological feasible. For the
case m > 0, the existence of resistance-free equilibrium does not depend on the scale
of Rsc, and the disease-free equilibrium no longer exists.

Notice that S0 given by (2.5) represents the frequency of individuals which carry
the bacteria sensitive to drug 1 in the absence of antibiotic-resistant infection, while
X0 = 1 − S0 represents the frequency of individuals who are not colonized with the
sampled species. These two quantities together can be used to describe the invasion
reproduction number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which is denoted by Rar and
deﬁned as

Rar =

β(1 − c)X0 + σβ(1 − c)S0
τ2 + γ + µ + σβS0

.

(2.6)

The invasion reproduction number Rar represents the total number of individuals colo-
nized with antibiotic-resistant bacteria caused by one “infected” individual during the
entire period of colonization (1/(τ2 + γ + µ + σβS0)) when the antibiotic-resistant bac-
teria invade into a population where individuals carrying the sensitive bacteria are at
the level S0, and individuals not colonized with the sampled species are at the level
X0. Note that the total individuals colonized with antibiotic-resistant bacteria not
only include the colonization of ones who are free of the bacterial species of interest,
but also the colonization of ones who carry the sensitive bacteria in which case the
superinfection occurs.

The invasion reproduction number Rar also can be written as a function of control

reproduction numbers Rrc and Rsc which is implied in the expression of S0:

Rar =

(1 − c)[1 − (1 − σ)S0]Rrc
1 − c + σS0Rrc

.

(2.7)

Remark 2.2. It follows from (2.7) that Rar ≥ 1 ⇒ Rrc > 1 and Rrc ≤ 1 ⇒ Rar < 1.

The stability of the resistance-free equilibrium E∗

0 can be determined by the invasion

reproduction number Rar, which is described in the following result.

2.2 Existence and stability analysis of interior equilibria

This subsection is devoted to the study of the existence and stability of interior

equilibria.

An equilibrium E∗(S∗, R∗) is called an interior equilibrium of system (1.2) if E∗(S∗, R∗)

is an interior point of Ω, i.e.,

0 < S∗ < 1, 0 < R∗ < 1 − S∗.

(2.10)

2.2.1 Existence of interior equilibria

It follows from V (S∗, R∗) = 0 that

R∗ = −

1 − c + σc
1 − c

S∗ +

Rrc − 1
Rrc

.

(2.11)

Substituting it into U (S∗, R∗) = 0, we get the following equation satisﬁed by the
abscissa of the interior equilibrium (for which we drop “∗” for simplicity)

Φ(S) = φ2S2 + φ1S + φ0 = 0,

(2.12)

where

φ2 = c2σ(1 − σ), φ1 = (1 − c)

(cid:18) 1 − cσ
Rrc

+ cσ −

(cid:19)

Rsc

, φ0 =

(1 − c)mµ
β

.

(2.13)

To make sure that E∗(S∗, R∗) is an interior equilibrium of system (1.2), by (2.10)

and (2.11), we have the following conditions which must be satisﬁed:

Rrc > 1 and 0 < S∗ <

(1 − c)(Rrc − 1)
(1 − c + cσ)Rrc

= a∗ < 1.

(2.14)

6

X. Cen, Z. Feng, Y. Zheng and Y. Zhao

Note that a∗ < 1 holds naturally and a∗ > 0 if and only if Rrc > 1.
If Rrc ≤ 1,
then Rar < 1 by Remark 2.2 and system (1.2) has no interior equilibrium. Hence, the
number of roots of equation (2.12) in the interval (0, a∗) corresponds to the number of
interior equilibria of system (1.2), and it is no more than 2. Although the coeﬃcients of
Φ(S) are a little complex, we can determine the number of solutions S∗ by examining
the properties of the function Φ(S).

A direct computation leads to

Φ(0) = φ0 > 0, Φ(a∗) = Φ0(a∗)(1 − Rar),

(2.15)

where

Φ0(a∗) =

(1 − c)(1 − c + σS0Rrc)
(1 − c + σc)Rrc

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

a∗ − ˜S0

> 0,

with ˜S0 being the other root of the equation (2.4) and ˜S0 < 0.

If cσ(1 − σ) = 0, then φ2 = 0 and Φ(S) is linear, and thus system (1.2) has a unique

interior equilibrium if and only if Rar > 1 (i.e., Φ(a∗) < 0).

If cσ(1 − σ) > 0, then Φ(S) is quadratic and it has at most 2 zeros. (i) When
Rar > 1, we have Rrc > 1 and Φ(a∗) < 0. It follows from Φ(0) > 0 that the system
has a unique interior equilibrium. (ii) When Rar < 1 (in this case Rrc > 1 can’t be
derivated), we suppose Rrc > 1 and get Φ(a∗) > 0. The system (1.2) may have 0, 1, or
2 interior equilibria, which is determined by the sign of the discriminant

(2.16)

and the position of symmetry axis −φ1/(2φ2) of quadratic polynomial equation (2.12).
The detailed analysis is as follows:

Note that Φ(S) achieves its minimum at −φ1/(2φ2). Hence, system (1.2) has two

diﬀerent interior equilibria if and only if

If

Rar < 1, ∆ > 0,

0 < −

∆ = 0,

0 < −

φ1
2φ2

< a∗,

(2.17)

(2.18)

then system (1.2) has only one interior equilibrium.

(iii) When Rar = 1, we have Rrc > 1 and Φ(a∗) = 0.

It suﬃces to ensure
−φ1/(2φ2) < a∗ that system (1.2) can have a unique interior equilibrium. This is be-
cause that Φ(S) assumes its minimum at −φ1/(2φ2) and it follows from −φ1/(2φ2) < a∗
and Φ(a∗) = 0 that this minimum is less than 0. Combining Φ(0) > 0, we have
−φ1/(2φ2) > 0 and Φ(S) has exactly one zero in (0, a∗).

System (1.2) has none interior equilibria for all other cases.

We simplify the existence conditions (2.17) and (2.18), and summarize the discus-

sions above as follows:

Bifurcation and dynamics of a model of antibiotic resistance

Theorem 2.5. Let Rar be the invasion reproduction number deﬁned in (2.6) or (2.7),
and Rsc, Rrc be the control reproduction numbers deﬁned in (2.2) and (2.3), respec-
tively.

(a) If Rar > 1, then system (1.2) has a unique interior equilibrium;

(b) if cσ(1 − σ) > 0, β > β∗ and Rrc > R∗

are derived from the conditions ∆ = 0 and Rar = 1, respectively.

Remark 2.6. (i) The condition (2.18) actually determines a lower bound Rc
ar of Rar
(note that in this case, Φ(a∗) > Φ(−φ1/(2φ2)) = 0, thus condition (2.18) implies that
Rc
ar < 1 by (2.15)), such that system (1.2) has two diﬀerent interior equilibria if and
only if Rc

ar < Rar < 1.

X. Cen, Z. Feng, Y. Zheng and Y. Zhao

requires that f (Rrc) > 0, i.e., β > β∗ and Rrc > R∗
given in (2.8) and (2.9), respectively, and

rc, where f (Rrc), β∗ and R∗

rc are

Ra∗

sc =

(1 − c + cσ)Rrc
1 − c + cσRrc + c2σ(1 − σ)(Rrc − 1)

comes from −φ1/(2φ2) = a∗. This provides the existence condition of R(cid:52)

sc and Rc

ar.

(iii) Similarly, under the hypothesis of f (Rrc) > 0, condition (2.17) is equivalent to

R1

sc < Rsc < R(cid:52)

sc, i.e., Rc

ar < Rar < 1.

Remark 2.7. The existence of interior equilibria depends not only on Rar, but also
on Rrc and Rsc. To see how the number of interior equilibria varies, we choose Rrc
and Rsc as the bifurcation parameters and consider bifurcations in (Rrc, Rsc) plane.

For the case of cσ(1 − σ) > 0 and β > β∗,

thus, the curves Rsc = R(cid:52)

rc,
and thus the (Rrc, Rsc) plane will be divided into three regions Di, i = 0, 1, 2; for
all other cases, the (Rrc, Rsc) plane only be divided into two regions Di, i = 0, 1. If
(Rrc, Rsc) ∈ Di, then system (1.2) has i interior equilibria, see Figure 2.

and the solid part corresponds to one interior equilibrium. For all other parameters

2.2.2 Local stability of interior equilibria

by

(cid:18)

or the simpliﬁed matrix

(cid:18) −βS∗ − mµ/S∗ −β(1 − cσ)S∗

.

Obviously, the trace and the determinant of J(E∗) are:

trJ(E∗) = −βS∗ − mµ/S∗ − β(1 − c)R∗ < 0,
detJ(E∗) = βR∗[mµ(1 − c) − βc2σ(1 − σ)S∗2]/S∗ = βR∗(φ0 − φ2S∗2)/S∗.

(2.22)

Note that

(trJ(E∗))2 − 4detJ(E∗)

=(βS∗ + mµ/S∗ − β(1 − c)R∗)2 + 4β2(1 − cσ)(1 − c + cσ)S∗R∗ > 0.

(2.23)

Thus, the stability and the type of the interior equilibria can be determined by (2.22)
and (2.23), which is described in more detail in the following result.

Theorem 2.8. Consider the interior equilibria described in Theorem 2.5.

Remark 2.9. From the analysis of the case cσ(1 − σ) = 0, we know that system
(1.2) can not have a backward bifurcation when superinfection is not considered (σ =
0). However, system (1.2) which includes the superinfection (σ > 0) may exhibit
the backward bifurcation, see Theorem 2.8. Apparently, the occurrence of backward
bifurcation will make it more challenging to control the antibiotic-resistant infection
since the threshold for eradication is reduced from 1 to Rc
ar. The determination of the
new threshold plays a key role in providing quantitative criteria to evaluate the success
of interventions to control infections in hospitals.

2.3 Global dynamics

Based on the analysis in the previous subsections, we are going to give global
dynamics of system (1.2) on the positively invariant set Ω. To do this, we use Dulac
theorem [10] to rule out the existence of limit cycles and homoclinic loops.

Proposition 2.10. System (1.2) has no limit cycles or homoclinic loops.

Proof. Introduce a function

for all S > 0, R > 0.

The proposition follows from Dulac theorem [10].

By Proposition 2.1, Theorems 2.3, 2.5, 2.8 and Proposition 2.10, we obtain the

global dynamics of system (1.2) as follows.

Theorem 2.11. Let Rar be the invasion reproduction number deﬁned in (2.6) or (2.7),
and Rsc, Rrc be the control reproduction numbers deﬁned in (2.2) and (2.3), respec-
tively. The following statements hold:

3 Numerical analysis

This section is devoted to numerical simulations for the global results we obtained
ar given in

in last section, the possible backward bifurcation, and the dependence of Rc
(2.19) on parameters.

Figure 4 demonstrates the simulation results of the system for the case Rar > 1
(a), and the case Rar < 1 and no interior equilibrium exists (b). Numerical results
show that, in (a), system (1.2) has a unique interior equilibrium, and all the solution
curves with initial values S(0) ≥ 0, R(0) > 0 will eventually converge to this interior
equilibrium; in (b), the system will stabilize at the resistance-free equilibrium, which
is globally asymptotically stable. The parameter values in Figure 4(a) are m = 0.75,
µ = 0.1, β = 1, τ1 = 0.35, τ2 = 0.1, γ = 1/30, σ = 0.25, c = 0.05, and thus Rar = 1.5;
most parameter values in Figure 4(b) are the same as those in Figure 4(a), except
τ1 = 0.1 and τ2 = 0.35, and in this case Rar = 0.9. The parameter values we used
come from [3, 4, 5].

Figure 5 plots the solution curves of system (1.2) for diﬀerent initial conditions when

equilibrium exists (b).

Rc
ar < Rar < 1. Only the frequency of patients with the antibiotic-resistant bacteria
R are shown. We can see clearly that the solution curves with the initial values near
R(0) = 0 will converge to the resistance-free equilibrium E0, while the solution curves
with the larger initial values will converge to the stable interior equilibrium E∗
1 as
t → ∞, which implies a bistable phenomenon. The parameter values in this ﬁgure are:
m = 0.2, µ = 1/15, β = 5, τ1 = 0.3, τ2 = 0.19, γ = 1/30, σ = 0.3, c = 0.15. For this
set of parameter values, Rar = 0.9997 and Rc

ar = 0.9994.

Figure 6 shows the backward bifurcation described in Theorem 2.8. The equilib-
rium fraction of individuals carrying the antibiotic-resistant bacteria R∗ is plotted as a
function of Rar. The solid part and the dashed part represent the stable and unstable
interior equilibria, respectively. The leftmost point of the curve (the intersection of
the solid and dashed branches) corresponds to the lower bound of Rar, Rc
ar, for the
existence of two interior equilibria. The vertical arrows indicate the convergence of
solutions with initial conditions in the respective regions as t → ∞. In this ﬁgure, we
choose τ1 as the independent variable to vary Rar, and other parameter values are the
same as those in Figure 5.

ar < Rar < 1. Obviously, Rc

Figure 7 illustrates the dependence of lower bound Rc

ar given by (2.19) on param-
eters m, µ, τ2, β, σ and τ1, respectively. The dashed curve corresponds to the lower
bound Rc
ar of Rar, such that there are two interior equilibria in the shaded region when
Rc
ar increases with m, and disappears when m exceeds a
threshold value, see Figure 7(a). In Figure 7(d), Rc
ar decreases with β. It is worth
noting that when all other parameters are ﬁxed, Rc
ar may exist if and only if β reaches
some threshold value (β∗). The dependence of Rc
ar on parameters µ (see Figure 7(b)),
τ2 (see Figure 7(c)) and τ1 (see Figure 7(f)) is similar to that on m, however, for the
parameter τ1, Rc
ar may exist only if τ1 reaches some threshold value. The most special
one is the dependence of Rc
ar decreases ﬁrst
with σ, then increases, until σ exceeds some threshold value. The parameters ﬁxed in
this ﬁgure have the same values as those in Figure 5.

(1.2) has two diﬀerent interior equilibria. Solution curves for diﬀerent initial conditions
are plotted, only demonstrating the fraction of individuals R which carry the bacteria
resistant to drug 1.

Uniform distribution [0,1], β obeys Triangular distribution[0,10], γ obeys Uniform dis-
tribution [1/60,1/30], µ obeys Uniform distribution [1/20,1/7], and c obeys Triangular
distribution[0,0.3]. It is clearly shown that the treatment of drug 1 (τ1) has the most
important inﬂuence on the frequency of patients colonized with antibiotic-resistant bac-
teria, and they are positively correlated, while the treatment of drug 2 is negatively
correlated with it.

4 Discussion

Antibiotic resistance has caused worldwide concern, and the studies on the trans-
mission dynamics of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are important for us to understand
and take measures to control it. In the present paper, we give a full analysis of the
global dynamics of an antibiotic-resistance model, in which superinfection is included,
and numerical simulations are done to verify the analytical results. Our results sug-
gest that when there is no superinfection (σ = 0), the system has a unique interior
equilibrium if and only if Rar > 1. That is to say, the model can’t generate the back-
ward bifurcation without superinfection. Thus, superinfection (σ > 0) increases the
possibility of occurrence of the backward bifurcation.

From model analysis and simulations, we ﬁnd some threshold conditions for the
elimination of transmission of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, for example, controlling
Rrc ≤ 1 such that Rar < 1, or controlling Rar < Rc
In practice, it
means control measures can be aimed at reducing the primary transmission rate (β) or
increasing the use of drug 2 (τ2) with cautions that no new resistance develops.

In the Appendix, we also provide the global dynamics of the model for m = 0.

Obviously, they have enormous diﬀerence with the case m > 0.

In future study, we will consider the isolation of patients with antibiotic-resistant
bacteria, and investigate the dynamics of the new system; or introduce a nonlinear
term, for example, assuming that patients with antibiotic-resistant bacteria consume
more medical resources, and this leads to a reduction in new patients admitted with
sensitive bacteria, that is, the proportion of admitted already colonized with sensitive
bacteria m depends on the frequency of individuals who carry the antibiotic-resistant
bacteria R. More complicated and rich dynamics and bifurcations are expected.

Appendix

Proof of Proposition 2.1. Consider the directions of the orbits of system (1.2) on
the boundary of Ω.

Firstly, along the R-axis, it follows from the ﬁrst equation of (1.2) that S(cid:48)(t)|S=0 =
mµ ≥ 0. Hence, either R-axis is an invariant line of system (1.2) (m = 0), or the vector
ﬁeld of system (1.2) at each point on R-axis points to the interior of Ω (m > 0).

Secondly, consider the boundary S + R = 1. By system (1.2), we get that

d(S + R)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)R=1−S

= −(1 − m)µ − τ2 − γ − τ1S < 0.

Therefore, any orbit starting from a point on the boundary S +R = 1 enters the interior
of Ω as t increases.

If cσ(1 − σ) = 0, then detJ(E∗) = β(1 − c)mµR∗/S∗ > 0. With (2.22) and (2.23),
we get that Jacobian matrix J(E∗) has two negative eigenvalues, i.e., the unique interior
equilibrium is a node and it is l.a.s..

If cσ(1 − σ) > 0, then the unique zero of Φ(S) in (0, a∗) is S∗ = (−φ1 −

We have E∗

1 is a l.a.s. node, and E∗

2 is an unstable saddle by (2.22) and (2.23).

(b)(ii) Here Φ(S) has a zero S∗ = −φ1/(2φ2) in (0, a∗) with multiplicity 2. Further

calculus shows that

detJ(E∗) =

βR∗(4φ0φ2 − φ2

Therefore, detJ(E∗) has an eigenvalue equal to zero. We will determine the stability
by using the center manifold theory to system (1.2). Translate E∗ to the origin and
take the aﬃne transformation

Then system (1.2) is reduced to the norm form:

where F (S, R) and G(S, R) are homogenous quadratic polynomials and thus they satisfy

F (0, 0) = 0, G(0, 0) = 0, DF (0, 0) = O, DG(0, 0) = O.

It follows from the center manifold theorem [11] that there exists a locally invariant
manifold S = h(R) ∈ C2 such that all the solutions on this center manifold have the

Since the coeﬃcient of R2 in (4.1) is negative, we have E∗ is a saddle-node and it is
unstable.

(a) When Rsc ≤ 1 and Rrc ≤ 1, the disease-free equilibrium O(0, 0) is locally asymp-

totically stable (l.a.s.);

(b) when Rsc > 1 and Rrc ≤ 1, the disease-free equilibrium O(0, 0) is unstable, and

the resistance-free equilibrium E0(S0, 0) is l.a.s.;

(c) when Rsc ≤ 1 and Rrc > 1, the disease-free equilibrium O(0, 0) is unstable, and

the resistant equilibrium U0(0, R0) is l.a.s.;

(d) when Rsc > 1 and Rrc > 1, the disease-free equilibrium O(0, 0) is unstable,

(i) if cσ(1 − σ) > 0 and (1 − c + cσ)Rrc/(1 − c + cσRrc) < Rsc < Rrc/(1 −
cσ + cσRrc), then both the resistance-free equilibrium E0(S0, 0) and the re-
sistant equilibrium U0(0, R0) are l.a.s., and the unique interior equilibrium
E1(S1, R1) is unstable,

(ii) if cσ = 0 and Rsc = Rrc, then all the solution orbits of system (1.2) converge
to the singular line S0−R−S = 0, and if σ = 1 and Rsc = Rrc/(1−c+cRrc),
then all the solution orbits of system (1.2) converge to the singular line
S0 − (1 − c)R − S = 0,

(iii) if Rsc < (1 − c + cσ)Rrc/(1 − c + cσRrc), then the resistance-free equilibrium
E0(S0, 0) is unstable, and the resistant equilibrium U0(0, R0) is l.a.s.,

(iv) if Rsc > Rrc/(1 − cσ + cσRrc), then the resistance-free equilibrium E0(S0, 0)

is l.a.s., and the resistant equilibrium U0(0, R0) is unstable,

(v) if cσ(1−σ) > 0 and Rsc = (1−c+cσ)Rrc/(1−c+cσRrc), then the resistance-
free equilibrium E0(S0, 0) is unstable and the resistant equilibrium U0(0, R0)
is l.a.s.,

(vi) if cσ(1 − σ) > 0 and Rsc = Rrc/(1 − cσ + cσRrc), then the resistance-
free equilibrium E(S0, 0) is l.a.s. and the resistant equilibrium U0(0, R0) is
unstable,

where S0, R0, S1 and R1 are given by (4.2).

By Proposition 2.1, Theorems 4.1, 4.2 and Proposition 2.10, we obtain the global
dynamics of system (1.2) for the case m = 0, see Figure 9. The phase portraits
correspond to the cases of Theorem 4.2.
