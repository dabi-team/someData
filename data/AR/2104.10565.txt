(Dated: 14 June 2021)

We present a cost-eﬀective treatment of the triple excitation amplitudes in the time-dependent optimized
coupled-cluster (TD-OCC) framework called TD-OCCDT(4) for studying intense laser-driven multielectron
dynamics. It considers triple excitation amplitudes correct up to fourth-order in many-body perturbation
theory and achieves a computational scaling of O(N 7), with N being the number of active orbital functions.
This method is applied to the electron dynamics in Ne and Ar atoms exposed to an intense near-infrared
laser pulse with various intensities. We benchmark our results against the time-dependent complete-active-
space self-consistent ﬁeld (TD-CASSCF), time-dependent optimized coupled-cluster with double and triple
excitations (TD-OCCDT), time-dependent optimized coupled-cluster with double excitations (TD-OCCD),
and the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) methods to understand how this approximate scheme performs
in describing nonperturbatively nonlinear phenomena, such as ﬁeld-induced ionization and high-harmonic
generation. We ﬁnd that the TD-OCCDT(4) method performs equally well as the TD-OCCDT method,
almost perfectly reproducing the results of fully-correlated TD-CASSCF with a more favorable computational
scaling.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The advance in experimental techniques for high-
intensity ultrashort optical pulses has contributed sub-
stantially to enrich strong-ﬁeld physics and attosecond
science1–4.
It is also showing promise to measure and
manipulate the motions of electrons in a quantum many-
body system5,6. One of the key processes in attosecond
physics is high-order harmonic generation (HHG)7,8. It
is a highly nonlinear frequency conversion process that
delivers ultrashort coherent light pulses in the extreme-
ultraviolet (XUV) to the soft x-ray regions interacting
with laser pulses of intensity (cid:38) 1014 W/cm2 in the visi-
ble to the mid-infrared spectral range. The HHG spectra
consist of a plateau where the intensity of the emitted
radiation remains nearly constant up to many orders,
followed by a sharp cutoﬀ, beyond which harmonics are
ceased to observe9.

The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE)
provides the most rigorous theoretical description of all
these dynamical phenomena10–17. However, it remains a
major challenge to achieve the exact numerical solution
of TDSE for more than two-electron systems due to its
high dimensionality. Thus, single-active electron (SAE)
approximations have been widely used18,19, in which only
the outermost electron is explicitly treated. Though use-

ful in obtaining a qualitative insight into diﬀerent strong-
ﬁeld phenomena, SAE is intrinsically unable to treat the
electron correlation in the ﬁeld-induced multielectron dy-
namics.

Therefore, the development of various time-dependent,

standing of
intense-laser-driven multielectron dynam-
ics. See Ref. 20 for a review on various wavefunction-
based methods
laser-driven elec-
tron dynamics, and Ref. 21 for multiconﬁguration ap-
proaches for indistinguishable particles. The multi-
conﬁguration time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF)
method22–26 and time-dependent complete-active-space
self-consistent-ﬁeld (TD-CASSCF) method27,28 are the
best known for the purpose. Both these methods are
based on the full conﬁguration interaction (FCI) ex-
pansion of the wavefunction, Ψ(t) = (cid:80)
I CI (t)ΦI (t),
where both CI coeﬃcients {CI (t)} and occupied spin-
orbitals {ψp(t)} constituting Slater determinants {ΦI (t)}
are time-dependent and propagated in time according to
the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). The
TD-CASSCF method broadens the applicability by ﬂex-
ibly classifying occupied orbital space into frozen-core (do
not participate in dynamics), dynamical-core (do partic-
ipate in the dynamics remaining doubly occupied), and
active (fully correlated description of the active electrons)
subspaces. By such ﬂexible classiﬁcation, it helps to get
rid of a large number of chemically or physically inert
electrons from the correlation calculation and thereby
enhance the applicability. However, these methods scale
factorially with the number of correlated electrons, re-

 
 
 
 
 
 
stricting large scale applications. By limiting the con-
ﬁguration interaction (CI) expansion of the wavefunc-
tion up to an aﬀordable level, various less demanding
methods29–33 like the time-dependent restricted-active-
space self-consistent ﬁeld (TD-RASSCF)29,30 and time-
dependent occupation-restricted multiple-active-space
(TD-ORMAS)32 have been developed. These methods
have proven to be of great utility34 even though not size-
extensive.

On the other hand, the coupled-cluster method is
the most celebrated many-body method while dealing
with the electron correlation. It is size-extensive at any
given level of truncation, scales polynomially, and has
proven its eﬀectiveness on a wide range of problems in
the stationary theory35–37. Therefore, we have devel-
oped its time-dependent extension using optimized or-
thonormal orbitals, called the time-dependent optimized
coupled-cluster (TD-OCC) method38. The TD-OCC
method is the time-dependent formulation of the station-
ary orbital optimized coupled-cluster method39–41, and
we have considered double and triple excitation ampli-
tudes (TD-OCCDT) in our implementation. Here again,
both orbitals and amplitudes are time-dependent and
propagated in time according to TDVP. We applied our
method to simulate HHG spectra and strong-ﬁeld ion-
ization in Ar. The TD-OCCDT produced virtually iden-
tical results with the TD-CASSCF method in a poly-
nomial cost-scaling within the same chosen active orbital
subspace38. In an earlier development, Kvaal reported an
orbital adaptive time-dependent coupled-cluster (OAT-
DCC) method42 built upon the work of Arponen using
biorthogonal orbitals43. However, this work does not ad-
dress applications to laser-driven dynamics. We also take
note of the very initial attempts of the time-dependent
coupled cluster44–46, and its applications using time-
independent orbitals47–52. See Ref. 53 for the discussion
on numerical stability of time-dependent coupled-cluster
methods with time-independent orbitals, and Refs. 54,55
for symplectic integrator and interpretation of the time-
dependent coupled-cluster method. The TD-OCCDT
method scales as O(N 8), with N being the number of
active orbitals.

To further reduce the computational scaling and
thereby enhance the applicability to larger chemical sys-
tems, we have developed time-dependent optimized cou-
pled electron pair approximation (TD-OCEPA0)56. This
method is much more eﬃcient than time-dependent op-
timized coupled-cluster with double excitations (TD-
OCCD), even though both scale as O(N 6). The supe-
rior eﬃciency is due to the linear Hermitian structure of
the Lagrangian, which helps to avoid a separate solution
for the de-excitation amplitudes. The above argument is
also true for the time-dependent optimized second-order
many-body perturbation (TD-OMP2) methods, which
scales as O(N 5), reported in Ref. 57. We have also re-
ported the implementation and numerical assessments of
the second-order approximation to the time-dependent
coupled-cluster single double (TD-CCSD) method, called

2

the TD-CC2 method58. The stationary variant of this
method (CC2)59 is one of the widely accepted lower-cost
methods. However, the TD-CC2 method suﬀers from the
lack of gauge invariance and instability in the real-time
propagation under the high-intensity ﬁelds, both due to
imperfect optimization of orbitals as opposed to the case
in fully-optimized TD-OMP257.

Thus, the TD-OCCD method and its lower-cost ap-
proximations such as TD-OCEPA056 and TD-OMP257
will be useful to investigate multielectron dynamics in
large chemical systems driven by intense laser ﬁelds.
Nevertheless, the inclusion of triple excitation ampli-
tudes is certainly attractive to achieve decisive accuracy,
as demonstrated by a quantitative agreement of TD-
OCCDT and TD-CASSCF results for strong-ﬁeld ioniza-
tion from Ar atom38. Therefore it is desirable to reduce
the computational cost of a method including the eﬀect
of triple excitations. Numerous reports are available in
the stationary coupled-cluster literature for reducing the
computational scaling retaining a part of the triple exci-
tation amplitudes60–64. The coupled-cluster theory and
the many-body perturbation theory are intricately con-
nected. Therefore, approximation of the coupled-cluster
eﬀective Hamiltonian based on many-body perturbation
theory is an appealing one.37

In this article, we report an eﬃcient approximation to
the TD-OCCDT method, treating triple excitation am-
plitudes within the ﬂexibly chosen active space correct
up to the fourth order in the many-body perturbation
theory. We designate this method as TD-OCCDT(4).
It is closely related to the stationary CCSDT1 method
of Bartlett and coworkers60,61. We do not include single
excitation amplitudes following our previous work38,56–58
but optimize the orbitals according to TDVP, which
is ideally suited for studying strong-ﬁeld dynamics in-
volving substantial excitation and ionization. The TD-
OCCDT(4) method inherits gauge invariance from the
parent TD-OCCDT method due to the variational op-
timization of orbitals. This method scales as O(N 7),
which is an order of magnitude lower than the full TD-
OCCDT method, rendering this method very much af-
fordable, while retaining important contributions of the
triples.

We apply our newly developed TD-OCCDT(4) scheme
to Ne and Ar atoms exposed to a strong near-infrared
laser ﬁeld. We compare TD-OCCDT(4) results with
those of the TD-CASSCF, TD-OCCDT, TD-OCCD, and
uncorrelated TDHF methods to asses the numerical per-
formance in describing laser-driven multielectron dynam-
ics. We ﬁnd that the TD-OCCDT(4) method performs
equally as well as the TD-OCCDT and fully correlated
TD-CASSCF methods, while reducing the computational
cost.

This paper is organized as follows. We derscribe the
TD-OCCDT(4) method in Sec. II. Section III presents
its numerical application to Ne and Ar. Conclusions
are given in Sec. IV. Hartree atomic units are used un-
less otherwise stated, and Einstein convention is implied

throughout for summation over orbital indices.

The complete set of 2nbas spin-orbitals (labeled with
µ, ν, γ, λ) is divided into nocc occupied (o, p, q, r, s) and
2nbas −nocc virtual spin-orbitals. The coupled-cluster (or
CI) wavefunction is constructed only with occupied spin-
orbitals which are time-dependent in general, and vir-
tual spin-orbitals form the orthogonal complement of the
occupied spin-orbital space. The occupied spin-orbitals
are classiﬁed into ncore core spin-orbitals which are oc-
cupied in the reference Φ and kept uncorrelated, and
N = nocc − ncore active spin-orbitals (t, u, v, w) among
which the active electrons are correlated. The active
spin-orbitals are further split into those in the hole space
(i, j, k, l) and the particle space (a, b, c, d), which are de-
ﬁned as those occupied and unoccupied, respectively, in
the reference Φ. The core spin-orbitals can further be
split into frozen-core space (i(cid:48)(cid:48), j(cid:48)(cid:48)) and the dynamical-
core space (i(cid:48), j(cid:48)). The frozen-core orbitals are ﬁxed in
time, whereas dynamical core orbitals are propagated in
time.27 (See Fig. 1 of Ref. 38 for a pictorial illustration
of the orbital subspacing.)

Following our previous work38, we rely on the real ac-
tion formulation of the time-dependent variational prin-
ciple with orthonormal orbitals,

is the vector potential, with E(t) being the laser elec-
tric ﬁeld linearly polarized along the z axis. Our meth-
ods are gauge invariant; both length-gauge and velocity-
gauge simulations produce identical results for physical
observables upon numerical convergence. The velocity
gauge is known to be advantageous in simulating high-
ﬁeld phenomena28,65,66.

where Ylm and fk(r) are spherical harmonics and the
normalized radial-FEDVR basis function, respectively.
The expansion of the spherical harmonics continued up
to the maximum angular momentum Lmax, and the ra-
dial FEDVR basis supports the range of radial coordinate
0 ≤ r ≤ Rmax, with cos1/4 mask function used as an ab-
sorbing boundary for avoiding unphysical reﬂection from
the wall of the simulation box. We have used lmax = 47
for Ne and lmax = 63 for Ar, and the FEDVR basis sup-
porting the radial coordinate 0 < r < 260 using 68 ﬁ-
nite elements each containing 21 (for Ne) and 23 (for Ar)
DVR functions. The absorbing boundary switched on at
r = 180 in all our simulations. First, the ground state is
obtained by the imaginary time relaxation. Starting from
the ground state, we perform real-time simulations by
switching the laser-ﬁeld. The Fourth-order exponential
Runge-Kutta method67 is used to propagate the EOMs
with 10000 time steps for each optical cycle. The sim-
ulations are continued for further 3000 time steps after
the end of the pulse. The 1s orbital of Ne and 1s2s2p or-
bitals of Ar are kept frozen at the canonical Hartree-Fock
orbitals, and for the correlated methods the eight valence
electrons are correlated among thirteen active orbitals.

In Figs. 1 and 2, we report the time evolution of
dipole moment, evaluated as a trace (cid:104)ψp|ˆz|ψq(cid:105)ρq
p using
the 1RDM. In Fig. 1 (a)(c)(e), we observe that, whereas
the TDHF results deviate substantially from the TD-
CASSCF results with larger deviation for higher inten-
sity, the TD-OCCDT produces almost the identical re-
sults with those of TD-CASSCF irrespective of the laser
intensity. The valence electrons are driven farther with
increasing laser intensity, which renders the dynamical
electron correlation (the eﬀect beyond the TDHF descrip-
tion) more relevant.

Figure 1 (b)(d)(f) compare coupled-cluster results with
three diﬀerent approximation schemes, TD-OCCDT,
TD-OCCDT(4), and TD-OCCD. We observe that the
TD-OCCDT and TD-OCCDT (4) results are indistin-
guishable on the scale of the ﬁgures, while TD-OCCD
slightly underestimates the oscillatory behavior. The
TD-OCCDT(4) method takes account of the dominant
part of the electron correlation, successfully approximat-
ing the triple excitation amplitudes.

Figure 2 shows similar results for Ar. The TDHF, TD-
OCCDT, and TD-CASSCF methods give virtually the
same results for 1014 W/cm2 intensity [Fig. 2 (a)]. On
the other hand, the TDHF result deviates from the others
for the higher intensities [Fig. 2 (c)(e)], indicating that
the electron correlation plays an increasingly important
role as the electrons are driven farther from the nucleus.
In Fig. 2 (b)(d)(f) we observe, analogous to the Ne case,

that the TD-OCCDT(4) result excellently agrees with
the TD-OCCDT one, while the TD-OCCD result slightly
deviates from them.

Overall, for both Ne (Fig. 1) and Ar (Fig. 2), the TD-
OCCDT(4) and TD-OCCDT methods with polynomial
scalings deliver practically the same results with the TD-
CASSCF method with a factorial scaling, irrespective of
the employed intensities. The TD-OCCDT(4) scales by
one order lower than the TD-OCCDT but works equally

well with the latter. Thus, the TD-OCCDT(4) method
is the most advantageous of the three.

In Figs. 3 and 4, we present the temporal evolution of
single ionization of Ne and Ar, respectively, evaluated as
the probability of ﬁnding an electron outside a radius of
20 a.u.. For this purpose we have used RDMs as deﬁned
in Refs. 68–70. Ionization probabilities are more sensi-
tive to the electron correlation26,71 to assess the capa-

In panels (a)(c)(e) we compare the
TD-CASSCF, TD-OCCDT, and TDHF methods, while
we compare diﬀerent time-dependent optimized coupled-
cluster approaches in panels (b)(d)(f). For both Ne and
Ar, the TDHF method leads to substantial underesti-
mation, indicating an important role played by the elec-
tron correlation in ionization. On the other hand, the
TD-OCCDT produces nearly identical results with the
TD-CASSCF method. We see from panels (b)(d)(f) that
the TD-OCCDT(4) and TD-OCCDT results are almost
identical to each other, irrespective of the laser intensi-
ties, whereas the TD-OCCD results slightly underesti-
mate. Especially for Ar [Fig. 4(b)(d)(f)], the deviation
grows with an increasing laser intensity. This observa-
tion again suggests that the consideration of the triples
becomes more important for higher intensity due to a
greater role of the electron correlation.

Figures 5 and 6 display the temporal evolution of dou-
ble ionization of Ne and Ar, respectively, evaluated as the
probability of ﬁnding two electrons outside a radius of 20
a.u.. Double ionization, which may involve recollision, is
expected to be even more susceptible to electron correla-
tion. For the case of Ne (Fig. 5), all the methods except
for TDHF predict similar double ionization probability.
However, in the case of Ar (Fig. 6) with more double
ionization than for Ne, the TD-OCCD method fails to
reproduce the TD-OCCDT(4) and TD-OCCDT results,
which in turn agrees well with the TD-CASSCF. The de-
viation is especially large at the highest laser intensity
employed [Fig. 6(f)].

Let us now turn to high-harmonic generation. We
present the HHG spectra calculated at three diﬀerent
laser intensities for Ne in Figs. 7-9 and for Ar in Figs. 10-
12. The HHG spectrum is obtained as the modulus
squared I(ω) = |a(ω)|2 of the Fourier transform of the ex-
pectation value of the dipole acceleration, which, in turn,
is evaluated with a modiﬁed Ehrenfest expression28. We
also plot the absolute relative deviation,

δ(ω) =

of the spectral amplitude a(ω) from the TD-CASSCF
value for each method in the panels (d) of Figs. 7-12.

Again, TDHF underestimates the spectral intensity,
presumably due to the underestimation of tunneling ion-
ization [Figs. 3 and 4], i.e., the ﬁrst step in the three-step
model72,73. The other four methods predict the virtually
same spectra on the logarithmic scale of the ﬁgures. The
relative deviation of results for each method from TD-
CASSCF ones depends only weakly on the harmonic or-
der and has a general trend of decreasing as TDHF>TD-
OCCD>TD-OCCDT(cid:38)TD-OCCDT(4). This observa-
tion clearly demonstrates the usefulness of the TD-
OCCDT(4) method.

Finally, we compare the computational cost of the dif-
ferent methods considered in this article. All our simu-
lations have been run on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6230
central processing unit (CPU) with 10 processors with a

putation time spent for the simulation corresponding to
Fig. 12. This table also lists the relative cost reduction
with respect to the TD-CASSCF method. The cost re-
duction for the TD-OCCDT(4) method (40%) is larger
than for the TD-OCCDT method (25%). As we have re-
peatedly seen above, the inclusion of triples is certainly
important for highly accurate simulations of high-ﬁeld
phenomena, and the TD-OCCDT(4) method takes ac-
count of the essential part of the triples at an aﬀordable
reduced computational cost.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have developed the TD-OCCDT(4) method as
a cost-eﬀective and eﬃcient approximation to the TD-
OCCDT method. This method considers triple excita-
tion amplitudes correct up to the fourth order in the
many-body perturbation theory. Its computational cost
scales as O(N 7). As numerical assessment, we have ap-
plied this method to Ne and Ar atoms irradiated by an
intense near-infrared laser pulse and compared the cal-
culated time-dependent dipole moment, single and dou-
ble ionization probability, and HHG spectra with those
obtained with other methods. We have found that the
TD-OCCDT(4) method takes account the major part of

triple excitation amplitudes, which are important for ob-
taining consistently accurate results over a wide range of
problems; the TD-OCCDT(4) method delivers the re-
sults virtually indistinguishable from those of its par-
ent, full TD-OCCDT method. Furthermore, the TD-
OCCDT(4) method achieves a 40% computational cost
reduction in comparison to the TD-CASSCF method for
the case of Ar calculation with eight active electrons with
thirteen active orbitals. The present TD-OCCDT(4)
method will extend the applicability of highly accurate ab
initio simulations of electron dynamics to larger chemical
systems.
