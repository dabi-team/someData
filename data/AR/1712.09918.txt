The analysis of domain wall dynamics is often simpliﬁed to one dimensional physics. For domain walls in
thin ﬁlms, more realistic approaches require the description as two dimensional objects. This includes the study
of vortices and curvatures along the domain walls as well as the inﬂuence of boundary effects. Here we provide
a theory in terms of soft modes that allows to analytically study the physics of extended domain walls and their
stability. By considering irregular shaped skyrmions as closed domain walls, we analyze their plasticity and
compare their dynamics with those of circular skyrmions. Our theory directly provides an analytical description
of the excitation modes of magnetic skyrmions, previously only accessible by sophisticated micromagnetic
numerical calculations and spectral analysis. These analytical expressions provide the scaling behaviour of the
different physics on parameters that experiments can test.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The existence of distinguishable magnetic domains in ferro-
magnetic ﬁlms1,2 is the basis for magnetic memories devices.3
The boundary between two opposite magnetic domains corre-
sponds to a domain wall (DW).4–7 DWs belong to a class of
textures called topological textures. Analytically in the low-
energy limit, DWs are often treated as one dimensional objects
that can be described by two soft modes.4,8–14 Experiments in
thin ﬁlms7,15–18 reveal however much richer conﬁgurations in-
cluding curved DWs and vortex DWs,19 which in such a one
dimensional picture are not captured. Therefore a two dimen-
sional theory is needed.

In this paper, we consider DWs as strings described by a
pair of ﬁelds of soft modes. We derive a theory that allows to
treat the local dynamics of the DW and interactions with local-
ized perturbations like impurities. Also the effects of external
perturbations can be easily added to the formalism.

Beyond DWs, magnetic skyrmions are promissing candi-
dates for applications in spintronics.20–23 Skyrmions have a
quantized topological charge and respond more efﬁciently to
applied currents.24,25 Due to their reduced size and particle-
like behavior they have attracted signiﬁcant interest in spin-
tronics26 with applications as memory and logic devices.3,27–29
Skyrmions are very much related to DWs in the sense at they
can be viewed as closed DWs. Often, their theoretical de-
scription is based on a radially symmetric ansatz correspond-
ing to a circular DW.30–33 The radial symmetry, however, is
not a requirement for their existence. Other shapes have been
oberved, for example, close to a defect34,35 or by exciting their
internal modes.35–39 The plasticity of the skyrmion shape has
several experimental advantages, including the ability to avoid
impurities34,35 and increasing the response to external electri-
cal currents.40,41 Here we describe skyrmions as closed DWs
without imposing shape-related symmetries. Our formalism
directly allows to study the dynamics of deformed magnetic
skyrmions and their eigenmodes.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present
the effective description of a DW as a string. We describe
the ansatz and obtain the effective energy for these topolog-
ical textures. In Sec. III we obtain an action that describes
the dynamics in terms of the soft mode ﬁelds. In Sec. IV we
consider closed DWs and analyze the dynamics of deformed
skyrmions. In particular, we consider three examples, we cal-
culate the dynamics of deformations (bumps) along skyrmions
and examine the rotational and the breathing mode dynamics
of deformed skyrmions. In Sec. V we report our conclusions.

II. DESCRIPTION OF DOMAIN WALL STRINGS

We consider a ferromagnetic ﬁlm with thickness τ ,
much smaller than the DW width, and with interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI).42–44 The magneti-
zation ﬁeld is described as M (r) = Msm(r), where m(r)
is a unit vector ﬁeld and Ms is the saturation magnetization.
The micromagnetic Hamiltonian corresponds to

where m⊥ is the vector of the in-plane components of the
magnetization mx, my. The term proportional to J > 0 is the
ferromagnetic exchange interaction. It favors the alignment
of the magnetization vectors. The term proportional to K cor-
respond to out-of-plane anisotropy interaction. It favors the
magnetization pointing along the easy-axis, perpendicular to
the plane of the ﬁlm. The term proportional to D is the inter-
facial DMI. For D ≥ 4
JK/π the ground state is given by a
helix,33 which can be viewed as a periodic structure of DWs.
In order to describe single DWs, we consider D <
JK. We
neglect explicit terms related to demagnetization ﬁelds as they

the state without edge twists and associate to them an effec-
tive potential. For DWs with periodic boundary conditions,
there is no such twisting and, consequently, there is no poten-
tial associated to it. The effective energy obtained from the
micromagnetic Hamiltonian given by Eq. (1) with periodic
boundary conditions is in terms of the effective coordinates

FIG. 1. A sketch of an extended smooth DW given by the curve
X(s) in a thin ﬁlm. Everywhere along the curve, the radius of cur-
vature is much bigger than ∆. The basis of the longitudinal, ˆel, and
normal, ˆen, vectors are represented in the ﬁgure. On the top left
corner, we show a typical cross section along the curve with the rep-
resentations of X(s) and Φ(s)

may be interpreted as a contribution to an effective anisotropy
in thin ﬁlms.45 The Hamiltonian from Eq. (1) has a character-
istic length, the DW width ∆ = (cid:112)J/2K, and a characteristic
JK.46 These two parameters de-
energy density scale, E =
ﬁne the scale for the dynamics of topological textures.

√

We consider a DW in a thin ﬁlm as an extended object de-

scribed by a curve X, see Fig. 1,

X(s) = (x(s), y(s), 0),

(2)

where s is a parameter along the curve. A local basis along
the curve is given by the unitary longitudinal vector ˆel(s) and
the unitary normal vector ˆen(s)

ˆel =

X (cid:48)
|X (cid:48)|

,

ˆen = ˆel × ˆez,

(3)

where for any function f (s) we deﬁne f (cid:48) ≡ ∂sf and |X (cid:48)| =
(cid:112)(∂sx)2 + (∂sy)2. Note that ˆe(cid:48)
l = kˆen, where the function
k ≡ k(s) is related to the local curvature κ(s) via k = |X (cid:48)|κ,
see App. A. We assume that the radius of the local curvature
1/κ at any point along the DW is much bigger than the DW
width, i.e. |X (cid:48)|/k (cid:29) ∆.

We consider an ansatz for an extended DW described by a
curve X(s) with a cross section along ˆen corresponding to a
rigid one-dimensional DW, see Fig. 1 and App. A. Thus, each
cross section is described by a pair of soft modes X(s), the
position of the cross section where the magnetization is in-
plane, and Φ(s), the angle of the in-plane magnetization with
respect to the vector ˆen(s). The effective description of the
DW string is in terms of the ﬁelds X(s) and Φ(s).

In the case of ﬁnite thin ﬁlms without periodic boundary
conditions, DMI produces a twist of the magnetization at the
boundaries.33,47 This means that, for open DW curves in thin
ﬁlms, DMI twists the magnetic proﬁle for cross sections close
to the edge. We treat these edge twists as a perturbation to

Here, cE , cκ and cd are dimensionless constants that depend
on the exact proﬁle of the DW along the normal direction ˆen,
see Appendix A. This effective Hamiltonian is one of the main
results of this paper. It is invariant under reparametrization,
s → γs where γ ∈ R. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (4) is proportional
to the length of the DW in analogy to the energy of a rubber
band. The solution that minimizes this term is a straight line.
The second term describes the fact that bending the DW leads
to a changes in Φ(cid:48) and vice versa. As the azimuthal angle can
be manipulated experimentally for example by local external
magnetic ﬁelds or spin waves,48–50 this provides a mechanism
to introduce curvature in DWs. Note that without DMI the
energy is invariant under global rotations of the azimuthal an-
gle of the DW. As DMI breaks inversion symmetry, it directly
couples the azimuthal angle Φ with the curvature and the total
length of the DW curve making the physics of the extended
DW more complex.

To calculate the effective potential due to boundary condi-
tions for open DWs, we assume the following two conditions:
i) the longitudinal vector ˆel at the boundary is perpendicular
to the edge; and ii) the length scale given by the DMI induced
boundary twists is not much bigger than the DW width ∆.
The ﬁrst condition implies that the magnetization conﬁgura-
tion at the edge corresponds to a DW with the same width as
in the bulk. Due to our assumption that the local curvature of
the extended DW is larger than its width, the second condi-
tion grants that the DW is straight in the region close to the
boundary. As a result, the DMI induced boundary condition
leads to a rigid twist of the magnetization proﬁle around ˆen for
cross sections close to the edge. As we substitute this modi-
ﬁed ansatz for the edges into the micromagnetic Hamiltonian
from Eq. (1), we obtain that the energy potential due to edge
effects does, as expected, not depend on the position X. The
main contributions are functions of Φ and Φ(cid:48) deﬁned only on
a small region around the edges. Within the above formalism,
the Zeeman interaction due to an external magnetic ﬁeld can
also be incorporated. In this case the boundary condition will
depend also on the relative positions of the string ends.51,52 In
the following we will restrict our analysis to periodic bound-
ary conditions.

For 2d magnetic textures it is possible to deﬁne a topologi-

cal charge of the form53

III. EFFECTIVE DYNAMICS OF EXTENDED DWS

ics in a ferromagnet is given by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
(LLG) equation59

(7)

where γ is the gyromagnetic constant, H is the Hamiltonian of
the system, α is the dimensionless Gilbert damping parameter,
and we deﬁne ˙f ≡ ∂tf for any function f . The ﬁrst term on
the right-hand side corresponds to the precession of the mag-
netization due to an effective magnetic ﬁeld and it conserves
energy. The second term correspond to a damping term which
promotes the alignment of the magnetization with the effec-
tive magnetic ﬁeld. The energy conserving part of the LLG
Eq. (7) may be obtained from varying the action60

where the ﬁrst part is the spin Berry phase SB expressed in a
standard spherical polar representation of the magnetization.61
Plugging in Eq. (7) the ansatz of a curved DW in terms of the
ﬁelds of soft modes, we obtain

ds|X (cid:48)|( ˙X · ˆen) (Φ − arccos (ˆen · ˆex)) ,
(9)
where cγ = 2Ms/γ, see App. B. From the spin Berry phase
action, Eq. (9), and the effective Hamiltonian, Eq. (4), it is
possible to obtain the equations of motion for the soft mode
ﬁelds X(s), Φ(s) to study the dynamics of DWs in thin ﬁlms,
such as the propagation of extended DWs in different geome-
tries, the inﬂuence of curvatures and the formation of cusps. A
full general description is however rather complicated as the
equations of motion are heavily inﬂuenced by the boundary
conditions.

In the case of Φ(cid:48) = 0, i.e. a constant azimuthal angle along

the DW, the Berry phase from Eq. (9) can be separated as

where by A we deﬁne the area of the ferromagnetic domain
with mz = −1. The ﬁrst term reveals that A and Φ are
conjugated soft modes,57 with a Poisson bracket given by
{Φ, A} = 1/(τ cγ). An important remark is that, since an
external out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld couples directly to A, it
produces, as expected, a precession of the angle Φ.

IV. EFFECTIVE DYNAMICS OF CLOSED DWS

In this section we study the dynamics of closed DWs that
can be parameterized within the polar coordinate representa-

FIG. 2. A sketch of how to obtain a skyrmion from extended DW
with periodic boundary condition.

The conservation of topological charge in the continuous ap-
proximation, is guaranteed by the boundary conditions. In a
magnetic lattice the conservation of topological charge holds
only for textures that are bigger than the discretization scale.
By substituting the ansatz of the DW string into Eq. (5) we
obtain,

Q =

(cid:90)

2π

ds (k − Φ(cid:48)) .

(6)

For open DWs in thin ﬁlms without periodic boundary con-
ditions, the topological charge neither needs to be an integer
number nor a conserved quantity. This means that it is pos-
sible to induce topological charge into these textures through
boundary dynamics.54,55 In contrast, for DWs with periodic
boundary conditions, this charge must be conserved in the
continuum approximation as the integrals over Φ(cid:48) and k are
quantized. Connecting the ends of a DW, see Fig. 2, leads to a
skyrmion. For such closed DW strings without knots, the con-
tribution from the integral over k is ±1, where we use Gauss-
Bonnet theorem. Thus, by interpreting skyrmions as closed
DW strings we, of course, also obtain their quantized topo-
logical charge of ±1 depending on their center magnetization.
Eqs. (4) and (6) reveal that a possible mechanism to produce
skyrmions out of DW strings is to manipulate the azimuthal
angle.56

In the following we will consider explicitly the dynamics
of extended DWs in Sec. III and the physics of closed DWs
in Sec. IV. For the case of open DWs the solution with min-
imum energy is given by a straight DW, where |X (cid:48)| is a con-
stant and Φ(cid:48) = k = 0; while for a closed DW the state
with minimum energy is given by a circular skyrmion with
radius R = ∆(cid:112)cE /(cκ − πD/E) and a constant azimuthal
angle Φ = π along the curve. Note that plugging in a circu-
lar skyrmion ansatz into Eq. (4) leads to the effective energy
known from the literature for skyrmions.33 These two mini-
mal solutions do not have local degrees of freedom for the
soft mode ﬁelds. Thus, the long range dynamics of a straight
DW is globally deﬁned by the soft mode pair {X, Φ}.57 In the
case of skyrmions, also two globally deﬁned soft modes are
enough to capture their dynamics, {R, Φ}, the radius of the
skyrmion and the azimuthal angle of the in-plane magnetiza-
tion along the radius.39,58

where s = [0, 2π), and r(s) is a smooth function with

distorted magnetic skyrmions as shown in the right panel of

lution in time is a rigid rotation with a frequency depending on their
size. Notice that the mode n = 1, corresponds to what is known as

we did not include damping dynamics. The addition of the
Gilbert-damping term corresponds to adding a term propor-
tional to the damping constant α that mixes the evolution of ˙r
and ˙Φ, see App.C.

Eq. (13a) has two interesting properties that we would like
to point out: i) we ﬁnd that the only contribution to the time
evolution of the area enclosed by the DW is due to the DMI.

ii) In the absence of DMI, Eq. (13a) has the form of a conti-
˙ρ = ∂s(j). Here, analogous to the charge
nuity equation, i.e.
density, it is proportional to the area per unit length and j cor-
responds to the density of topological charge per local length
change. This shows that the existence of Bloch lines, which
corresponds to a concentration of topological charge, can gen-
erate strong deformations of the DW.

where some of the terms with higher order derivatives van-
ished due to the periodic boundary conditions.

These equations provide a good intuition to the dynamics
of extended DWs as well as deformed skyrmions, and convey
the general dynamics of a broad range of magnetic textures. In
particular, this effective theory allows for the study of contin-
uous deformations of skyrmions without requiring the knowl-
edge of magnonic modes.
In the following we will explic-
itly explore three examples, the propagation of deformations
along a skyrmion, the eigenmodes of closed DWs and breath-
ing dynamics.

B. Wave propagation along the closed DW

Here we consider circular skyrmions with radius R0 with a
small and smooth deformation of size d, i.e. r(s, t) = R0 +
d(s, t) with d (cid:28) R0. We assume that the angle Φ and the
radius R0 are ﬁxed to the values minimizing the energy,33 i.e.
Φ = π and R0 = ∆(cid:112)cκ/(cE − cπ(D/E) where ∆ is the DW
width. In this case we obtain from Eq. (13a) a drift equation

(cid:19)

˙d + d(cid:48)

≈ 0.

(16)

This describes the propagation of the deformation d along the
DW. Since the curve is closed, this motion is periodic with
frequency ω ∝ Jγ/MsR3
0.

C. Rotational eigenmodes of a closed DW

Eq. (B6) is rather complicated as it contains higher order
derivatives. Integrating the equation of motion along the entire

In this example we consider solutions of Eq. (13a) that have
a rigid shape and obey the following conditions: i) the curve

has a maximum rmax and a minimum rmin radius, which
are of the order of the equilibrium radius R0 of a circular
skyrmion; ii) the solution depends on the combination s − ωt,
where s is the parameter along the curve, t is time, and ω
is a constant frequency; iii) the solution is periodic; and iv)
Φ(cid:48) = 0. With these conditions, we ﬁnd that the curve describ-
ing the DW string, is given by

r(s) ≈ rmin + ∆r sin2 (cid:16) ns
2

(cid:17)

,

(17)

where ∆r = rmax − rmin, and n is an integer. The ﬁrst four
solutions of the above equation are shown in Fig. 3. The so-
lutions in Eq. (17), which we obtained within our effective
theory, correspond to the skyrmion excitation modes reported
in the literature.38,39,62–64 The strength of our formalism is that
we can analytically obtain the frequencies. The frequency ωn
for the n-th mode is given by

ωn ≈ −

2Jcκ

(n − n3).

(18)

min
This result is in agreement with the result obtained by numer-
for the clockwise modes.64
ical methods by Kravchuk et al.
An important remark is that, even though this frequency does
not depend explicitly on the DMI, this interaction is necessary
to keep Φ constant along the DW string.

To obtain the full spectrum, we need also to consider the
cases in which ˙Φ (cid:54)= 0. For small perturbations of r and Φ,
around the minimum radius rmin and the equilibrium angle π,
Eqs. (B6) and (13a) become

These equations of motion correspond to oscillations with fre-
quency

ωn ≈ −

(20)

which corresponds to the counter-clockwise modes reported
by Kravchuk et al.64 To understand the difference for the
clockwise and counterclockwise modes, we notice that for the
clockwise modes, n < 0, oscillations for Φ and r travel in the
same direction while for the counterclockwise modes, n > 0,
they travel in opposite directions. Since in this formalism, the
angle Φ is deﬁned with respect to the normal direction along
the DW string, an oscillation for r already assumes a rota-
tion of the local magnetization. Therefore, if both oscillations
travel in the same direction, the oscillation in r can suppress
the oscillation for Φ, remaining the frequency ∼ 1/r3
min, while
if they travel in opposite directions, the oscillation in Φ should
be increased, producing the motion with frequency ∼ 1/rmin.

D. Breathing modes of a closed DW

Here we consider the smooth breathing dynamics of a
closed DW with Φ(cid:48) = 0 along the curve. This means that

5

its shape is ﬁxed and the dynamics is given by a scaling factor
(cid:15)(t), i.e. r(t, s) = (1 + (cid:15)(t))r0(s), where r0(s) is the equi-
librium ﬁxed shape. From Eqs. (14) and (15), we obtain the
following equations in terms of the scalling factor (cid:15)(t),

Eq. (15) is zero for the higher modes, due to symmetries.
Also, in the case of smooth breathing dynamics the last term
in Eq. (15) is small and therefore is neglected. From the ﬁrst
equation and ﬁrst term in the second equation we obtain the
condition for the equilibrium conﬁguration. They ﬁx r0(s)

We deﬁne r0(s) = ˜R0r(s), where r(s) is dimensionless and

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Motivated by the experimentally observed richer conﬁgu-
rations of topological magnetic textures in thin ﬁlms, in this
paper we extended the soft mode formalism of DWs beyond
the effective one dimensional theory. We provided an ansatz
for the effective description of a DW in terms of soft mode
ﬁelds. From the micromagnetic Hamiltonian for ferromag-
netic thin ﬁlms we obtained an effective energy for these topo-
logical textures revealing analogies of the DW string to elastic
rubber bands. An important remark is that our results are in-
variant under reparametrization. We have shown that circular
skyrmions are (meta-)stable conﬁgurations of the Hamiltonian
and analyzed their stability. We calculated the effective spin
Berry phase from which, associated with the effective energy,
and obtain the equations of motion describing the dynamics
of these structures. Finally we have applied our formalism
to three examples of skyrmion dynamics. This allowed us to
calculate the excitation modes of magnetic skyrmions analyt-
ically in agreement with previous works which only obtained
them by sophisticated micromagnetic numerical calculations
and spectral analysis. Our analytical expressions provide the
scaling behaviour of the frequencies on different measurable
parameters.

We would like to emphasize that our developed formalism
takes into account several aspects of topological textures dy-
namics, such as curvatures and variations of the in-plane mag-
netization. We have derived the topological charge for the ex-
tended DWs. Our theory allows the study of more complex
dynamics like the propagation of extended DWs in different
geometries with inhomogeneous perturbations, the local inter-
action of skyrmions and DWs, as well as the the annihilation
and creation of skyrmions mediated by DWs. Furthermore, it
is possible to analyze the stability of Bloch lines65–67 in DWs
and the creation of skyrmion lattices by excitation of worm
domains.15,68

For a more general case, however, a full treatment of the
boundary contributions is required.33 These boundary condi-
tions can be treated effectively52 and lead to additional terms
in Eq. (4). Micromagnetic simulations show that the edges
may be sources of both curvature and Bloch lines,69 and with
the presented formalism we can analyze their propagation
along the DW.

We conclude by mentioning that our formalism is ex-
tendible with regard to different types of interactions or more
generalized types of DMI,70,71 which will cover the dynamics
of more complex topological textures like antiskyrmions.

Appendix A: Derivation of the effective energy for the extended
DW

In this paper we describe an extended DW in terms of a
curve X(s) = (x(s), y(s), 0) and a local unitary basis along
the DW given by the longitudinal, ˆel, and the normal, ˆen, vec-
tors to the curve. We make the ansatz that the DW can be de-
scribed along the normal direction by a rigid one-dimensional
DW. We can transform the Cartesian basis ˆex, ˆey via a local
rotation into the basis ˆen, ˆel along the curve

x, y → n, l,

(A1)

where n, l are the coordinates along the vectors ˆen, ˆel, respec-
tively,

n(s) = (x − X(s)) · ˆen(s),

l(s) = (x − X(s)) · ˆel(s).
(A2)
Here x denotes any position in space and the parameter l takes
values in between zero and the length of the extended DW.
The transformation between the coordinate l and any string
parameter s is given by

dl = ds|X (cid:48)|.

The curvature κ of the DW is deﬁned by73

(A3)

(A4)

where in the last equality we have used Eq. (A3). According to
our ansatz, we separate the micromagnetic Hamiltonian from
Eq. (1) into three terms,

H = Hn + Hl + HD

(A5)

where

Hn = τ

Hl = τ

are the normal, longitudinal and DMI contribution to the
Hamiltonian respectively. We now show that our ansatz,

where each cross section corresponds to a rigid one-
dimensional DW, minimizes Hn with the given DW bound-
ary conditions. This can be directly seen by rewriting the ex-
change part in a spherical representation of the magnetization

sin θ = 0 for the ferromagnetic domains. For the time vari-
ation of θ, we note that θ ≡ θ(n). Any variation of θ cor-
respond to a translation along the local ˆen direction. Using
Eq. (A2), we get

where ˜n = n/∆ is dimensionless. The state with mini-
mum energy and DW boundary conditions, θ(nleft) = π and
θ(nright) = 0, corresponds to a solution with ∂˜nΦ = 0 and
a speciﬁc θ(˜n) dependence. This solution is invariant under a
rigid rotation of Φ. Furthermore, in the linear approximation
θ does not depend explicitly on l. The magnetization is then
given by

ˆm = cos Φ(l) sin θ(n)ˆen(l) + sin Φ(l) sin θ(n)ˆel(l)

+ cos θ(n)ˆez,

(A8)

where θ(n(s)) corresponds to a rigid DW centered at position
X(s). Plugging the magnetization conﬁguration of Eq. (A8)
into Eq. (A6) and perfoming the integration over n gives

(cid:82) (dl/|X (cid:48)|)Φ(cid:48) cos Φ. Upon integra-
angle contribution τ Dcd
tion along the length of the DW curve this term vanishes for
periodic boundary conditions. Moreover, for systems in which
the domain wall proﬁle is point symmetric to respect to the
center of the domain wall, we have that cd = 0. This point
symmetry, however, is not always satisﬁed and can be broken,
for example, by an out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld.

Appendix B: Spin Berry phase in the extended DW ansatz

Since θ(n) is ﬁxed by the DW solution, we may integrate the
n dependence and we obtain

SB = −τ cγ

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

dt

dl φ ( ˙X · ˆen),

(B5)

where cγ = 2Ms/γ and with the reparametrization from l
to s we obtain Eq. (9) of the main text. The magnetization
azimuthal angle φ in terms of the DW coordinates is

φ = Φ + ψ − arccos (ˆen · ˆex) .

(B6)

Notice that the integral of the term proportional to ψ in the
Berry phase corresponds to a total time derivative and does
not contribute to the dynamic equations. With Eqs. (B5) and
(B6) we obtain, therefore the effective Berry phase in Eq. (9)
in the main text. Also, as a remark, for a circular skyrmion we
have that arccos (ˆen · ˆex) = ψ.

A simpler case is when ∂lΦ = 0, meaning that Φ is globally
deﬁned along the DW curve. In this case, the ﬁrst term for the
effective Berry phase (9) becomes

SB1 = −τ cγ

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

dt Φ

dl( ˙X · ˆen).

(B7)

We can further simplify this equation by the following consid-
erations: The inﬁnitesimal area spanned by dn and dl is given
by dA = (dnˆen × dlˆel) · ˆez. A time variation of this area
corresponds to dn → dn + δn and dl → dl + δl, such that

δdA = (δnˆen × dl ˆel) · ˆez + (dnˆen × δl ˆel) · ˆez.

(B8)

We want to study the area change upon changing the DW

string X(t) with a ﬁxed parameterization, i.e.

˙dA.

The spin Berry phase in a standard spherical representation

of the magnetization in thin ﬁlm is61

˙dA =

(B2)

Note, that the second term vanishes as δl = 0 for a ﬁxed
parameterization and in the ﬁrst term we have calculated the
variation of the DW string along the normal direction.
Therefore, the second integral in Eq. (B7) becomes

(cid:90)

dl( ˙X · ˆen) =

(cid:90)

˙(dA) = ˙A,

(B10)

This representation has the advantage that the non-vanishing
contributions come only from regions within the DW, as

and we obtain the ﬁrst term in Eq. (10) of the main text.

Appendix C: Damping terms and Rayleigh functional

The damping term in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation,
Eq. (7) of the main text, can be derived from a Rayleigh func-
tional.59 This means that we can identify

The effect of damping occurs as additional terms γr, γΦ in
