INTRODUCTION

The controlled modiﬁcation of graphene properties
is essential for its proposed electronic applications1–5.
for
Ion irradiation is widely used for this aim (see,
example,6–9) due to the ability to control the energy of
ions and irradiation dose with high accuracy.
Irradia-
tion of pristine graphene results in increase of disorder
due to introduced structural defects which inﬂuences its
electrical and optical properties.

Ion irradiation as the method to introduce disorder is
interesting also due to the possible reversibility caused
by annealing of radiation damage. Many works were
devoted to the annealing of mono- and multi-layered
graphene ﬁlms. However, in most of previous papers,
annealing was used for pristine, non-irradiated graphene
as a procedure for overcoming unintentional doping and
removal of polymer residues, which remain after wet
graphene transfer to the substrate or after photolithog-
raphy used in the device processing10–14.
In a few pa-
pers, the procedure of annealing was employed to sam-
ples preliminary irradiated with ions15,16, plasma17 and
UV light18.

Usually, measurements of the Raman scattering spec-
tra (RS) are considered as an eﬀective tool for probing
the structure of disordered graphene ﬁlms and density
of introduced defects19–21. Typical RS spectra for disor-
dered graphene consist of three main lines. The G-line at
1600 cm−1 is common for diﬀerent carbon-based materi-
als, including carbon nanotubes, mono- and multilayered

graphene and graphite. The 2D-line at 2700 cm−1 is
related to an inter-valley two phonon mode, fully corre-
sponds to momentum conservation and is emitted in the
intact crystalline structure removed from any structural
defects. The defect-connected D-line at 1350 cm−1 is re-
lated to the inter-valley single phonon scattering process
which is forbidden in the perfect graphene lattice due to
momentum conservation, but is possible in the vicinity
of a lattice defect (edge, vacancies, etc.) Therefore, the
intensity of D-line is used (in the form of dimensionless
ratio of amplitudes of D- and G-lines, α = ID/IG) as a
measure of disorder in graphene layers. Correspondingly,
the normalized intensity of 2D-line β = I2D/IG can be
considered as a measure of non-destroyed part of the lat-
tice.

In this work, we report the results of measurements of
RS in monolayer graphene samples irradiated with diﬀer-
ent dose Φ of heavy (Xe) and light (C) ions and annealed
at diﬀerent temperatures in vacuum and in forming gas
(95%Ar+5%H2).

II. SAMPLES

Details of sample preparation, ion irradiation and mea-
surements of RS in our samples before annealing were re-
ported in our previous papers22,23. Two initial large scale
monolayer graphene specimens (5x5 mm) were supplied
by Graphenea Inc.. Monolayer graphene was produced
by CVD on copper catalyst and transferred to a 300 nm
SiO2/Si substrate using wet transfer process. Graphene
specimens of such a large size were not a monocrystalline,
they look like polycrystalline ﬁlms with the average size
of microcrystals about 10 microns22.

 
 
 
 
 
 
On the surface of the ﬁrst specimen, six groups of
micro-samples (0.2x0.2 mm) were prepared by means of
electron-beam lithography. Each group of samples was
irradiated by diﬀerent dose Φ of carbon ions C+ with
energy of 35 keV. On the surface of the second speci-
men, micro-samples were not fabricated. Six areas 2x1
mm2 each, of the whole specimen were just irradiated
by diﬀerent dose Φ of Xe+ ions with the same energy
of 35 keV. As a result, two series of samples irradiated
by heavy (Xe+) and light (C+) ions were obtained. In
the RS measurements, excitation was realized by a laser
beam with excitation wavelength λ = 532 nm and power
less than 2 mW to avoid heating and ﬁlm destruction.

It was shown in23, that dependences α(Φ) and β(Φ) for
both series of samples are merged if plotted not as a func-
tion of Φ, but as a function of the density of defects ND
= kΦ, introduced by irradiation, where the coeﬃcient k
depends on the energy and mass of the incident ion and
reﬂects the average fraction of carbon vacancies in the
graphene lattice per ion impact. It was found that for
C+-series, k ≈ 0.08, while for Xe+-series, k ≈ 0.824. De-
pendences of α(ND) and β(ND) for both series of samples
before annealing are shown in Fig. 1. Alignment of both
dependences plotted on this scale, allows us to attribute
all changes in the RS spectra observed after annealing,
to the diﬀerent annealing conditions.

In non-irradiated samples (for these samples we assume
that ND ≈ 1011 cm−2), α is very small and β is maximal.
With increase of ND, α increases while β decreases. How-
ever, with further increase of ND, α reaches a maximum
and then decreases. This non-monotonic behavior of α is
explained by theoretical model25 based on the assump-
tion that a single ion impact leads to formation of com-
pletely destroyed ”defective area, S-area, in the immedi-
ate vicinity of the defect which is surrounded by a more
extended activated area (A-area), where the graphene
lattice is preserved, but the proximity to the defect causes
a breakdown of the selection rules and gives rise to the
emission of D-peak, attributed to a single-phonon scat-
tering. Increasing of A-areas obviously results in an in-
crease of α and decrease of β. However, increase of ND is
accompanied by decrease of the mean distance between
defects LD = (ND)−1/2, and when LD becomes shorter
than the size of A-area, they begin to overlap with each
other and with S-areas. As a result, the value of α
reaches a maximum and then decreases. Additionally,
Fig. 1 shows that α and β → 0 at ND = 0.5 × 1014
cm−2. Disappearance of both Raman scattering lines
could be explained by the fact that at this ND, the mean
distance between defects LD = (ND)−1/2 ≈ 1.5 nm be-
comes smaller than the Raman relaxation length, 2 nm26.
Annealing of samples from Xe-series was performed
in high vacuum (2 − 4 × 10−6 Torr), while samples
from C-series were annealed in the mixed forming gas:
95%Ar+5%H2 (800 sccm). Before turning on the gas
ﬂow, the tube was pumped and purged to a pressure
about 100 Torr.
Samples were heated at a rate of
15◦C/min to diﬀerent annealing temperatures, Ta, and

then annealed for 1 hour. Cooling of the samples was
performed by shutting oﬀ the heater and letting samples
cool naturally.

For non-irradiated samples, ND is presumed 1011 cm−2.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figures 2 and 3 show RS measurements of samples an-
nealed in vacuum and in forming gas, accordingly, and
at diﬀerent Ta. All spectra are normalized to the inten-
sity of the G-line which is taken as 1. One can see that
annealing leads to changes in amplitudes of D and 2D-
lines, as well as to shifts of the frequencies of the peak
positions.

Figs. 4a,b show the values of α and β for samples
annealed in vacuum at diﬀerent Ta. One can see that
α decreases signiﬁcantly with increase of Ta, with most
of the change occurings at 550◦C. Decreasing α can be
interpreted as a removal of irradiation induced defects.
One might expect that decrease of α will lead to corre-
sponding increase of β. However, Fig. 4b shows that
after annealing at Ta = 550◦C, β decreases for pristine
and slightly irradiated samples, and increases only with
further increase of Ta. In Ref.27, simultaneous decrease of
D- and 2D-lines was observed in defected graphene with
increase of doping. So, we may suggest that in our ex-
periment, doping is induced by vacuum annealing at low
Ta followed by exposure of annealed samples to ambient
air.

Further increase of Ta up to 1000◦C leads to increase of
β up to the values almost equal to those before annealing
for lightly irradiated samples and up to relatively large
values for strongly disordered samples where 2D-line was
initially suppressed by ion irradiation (see insert in Fig.
4b). This can be attributed to the eﬀective defect re-
moval and partial reconstruction of the lattice structure.
However, after ﬁnal annealing at Ta = 1000◦C, D-line still
remains which means that defects are not fully removed.
We note, that in samples more disordered before anneal-
ing, the values of α which remain after full annealing, are
larger (see insert in Fig. 4a).

lines are the guide to the eyes.

Figure 5a,b shows similar dependences of α and β as a
function of Ta for samples annealed in forming gas. This
annealing is characterized by diﬀerent features: all data
oscillate strongly, so that it is possible to note only the
general trends: the ratio α decreases somewhat little for
slightly disordered samples, and remains more or less the
same for strongly irradiated samples, so after annealing
at Ta = 1000◦C all samples have a distribution α(ND)
with a maximum, which is similar than before annealing
(see insert in Fig. 5a and compare with insert in Fig.
4a). The ratio β continuously decreases a little with in-
crease of Ta for slightly disordered samples and increases
for strongly disordered samples in which the 2D-line was
initially suppressed. As a result, after ﬁnal annealing at
1000◦C, the values of β are small and lower than those
values in the case of vacuum annealing (compare insert
in Fig. 5b and insert in Fig. 4b). This gives rise to the

Vacuum annealing results also in appearance of a broad
band in RS, centered, approximately, near the position
of D-line at 1300 cm−1 (Fig. 6). In Ref.13, a similar band
was observed in graphene annealed at 400◦C in oxygen-
free atmosphere and was attributed to amorphous carbon
(aC) on the surface of graphene28. This can appear be-
cause of carbonization of organic traces of PMMA poly-
mer used in the wet transfer of CVD grown graphene ﬁlm
onto SiO2/Si substrate12. Due to existence of the aC-
band, the amplitude of D-line was always obtained after
subtraction of aC-band, using Lorentzian decomposition
as shown in Fig. 6. In samples annealed in forming gas,
aC-band was not observed, which shows that the polymer

Lorentzian curves.

Annealing in forming gas and in vacuum results in the
blue shift of the position of all three lines, D, G and
2D. There are two reasons for the blue shift of the Ra-
man peaks after annealing: (i) hole doping caused by
enhanced ability to adsorb oxygen and water molecules
after vacuum annealing and sample exposure to ambient
air27,29,30 or (ii) compressive stress caused by the diﬀer-
ence in the thermal expansion of graphene and substrate,
slipping of the graphene ﬁlm over substrate during heat-
ing and pinning of annealed at high Ta ﬁlm during cool-
ing back to room temperature16,31–35. It was shown in
Ref.33 that these two reasons of the blue shift can be dis-
tinguished when one plots the frequency (position) of the
2D-peak P2D versus position of the G-peak PG. When
doping eﬀect dominates, the slope of this dependence has
to be equal to 0.7, while existence of strain leads to an
increase of this slope up to 2.2. Fig. 7 shows this depen-
dence measured at diﬀerent Ta for both series of samples.
The slope is approximately 1.0 which shows that the com-
pressive strain plays an important role in the blue shift.
There is another argument to justify the contribution of
lattice strain to the blue shift. The lattice deformation
induced by strain leads to a change in the phonon energy,
and therefore shift of 2D-line connected with emission of
two equal phonons has to be double than the shift of D-
line. In Fig. 8, shifts ∆P of position of RS lines after an-
nealing at diﬀerent Ta are shown. One can see that below
Ta = 500◦C, shifts of all lines are equal which indicates
that it is caused mainly by doping, while with further
increase of Ta, shift of 2D-line is larger and the ﬁnal shift
after annealing at 1000◦C for 2D-line is, indeed, approxi-
mately two times larger than that for D-line. This shows
that at high annealing temperatures, the main reason of
shift is a compressive stress of the graphene lattice.

5

One can see from Fig. 8, that the frequency (posi-
tion) of both peaks oscillate with increase of Ta. Figure
5 shows that the intensities of D- and 2D-lines also oscil-
late when plotted as a function of Ta. Taking into account
that both changes are caused by annealing-induced lat-
tice deformation and doping, one can expect a possible
correlation between these quantities. Fig. 9 shows that,
indeed, there is some correlation between variation of the
intensities of RS lines and their peak positions. In Fig. 9,
the line amplitudes are normalized to the corresponding
values at room temperature (RT). Such correlated varia-
tion can originate from heterogeneous distribution of the
doping and the lattice strain. This can be caused by
grain boundaries in the initial polycrystalline large-scale
graphene specimens.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

6

In conclusion, the following principal features for an-
nealing of irradiated graphene in vacuum and in forming
gas are revealed:
1) Vacuum annealing below 500◦C, leads to simultane-
ous decrease of both D-line and 2D-line which can be
explained by unintentional doping caused by exposure of
annealed samples to ambient air. Further increase of Ta
up to 1000◦C leads to partial removal of defects and re-
construction of the damaged lattice. Annealing in form-
ing gas is less eﬀective in reconstruction of the damaged
lattice up to annealing at 1000◦C.
2) Annealing in vacuum leads also to appearance of a
broad band near the position of D-line which is attributed
to formation of amorphous carbon on the surface of
graphene caused by carbonization of traces of polymer
used in wet transfer of CVD grown graphene ﬁlm on
SiO2/Si substrate. Annealing in forming gas does not
lead to appearance of such a broad band, which indi-
cates that polymer residues are removed by annealing in
forming gas but only agglomerate in vacuum.
3) Annealing in vacuum and in forming gas is accom-
panied by a blue shift of all RS lines, which is due to
unintentional doping and compressive stress caused by
diﬀerent thermal expansion of monolayer graphene and
the substrate. Doping is the main mechanism of shift at
annealing below 500◦C, while stress dominates at high
Ta up to 1000◦C.
4) Fluctuations of the intensity and peak position of RS
lines are correlated and indicate inhomogeneous distribu-
tion of doping and strain across the samples, which may
be caused by location of samples on the polycrystalline
large-scale graphene specimen.
