ABSTRACT

Aims. Understanding the nature and evolution of the photospheric helicity ﬂux transfer is a key to reveal the role of magnetic helicity
in coronal dynamics of solar active regions.
Methods. Using SDO/HMI photospheric vector magnetograms and the derived ﬂow velocity ﬁeld, we computed boundary driven
helicity ﬂux with a 12 minute cadence during the emergence of AR 11928. Accounting the foot point connectivity deﬁned by non-
linear force-free magnetic extrapolations, we derived and analyzed the corrected distribution of helicity ﬂux maps.
Results. The photospheric helicity ﬂux injection is found to changes sign during the steady emergence of the AR. This reversal is
conﬁrmed with the evolution of the photospheric electric currents and with the coronal connectivity as observed in EUV wavelengths
with SDO/AIA. During about the three ﬁrst days of emergence the AR coronal helicity is positive while later on the ﬁeld conﬁguration
is close to a potential ﬁeld. As theoretically expected, the magnetic helicity cancelation is associated to enhanced coronal activity.
Conclusions. The study suggests a boundary driven transformation of the chirality in the global AR magnetic structure. This may be
the result of the emergence of a ﬂux rope with positive twist around its apex while it has negative twist in its legs. The origin of such
mixed helicity ﬂux rope in the convective zone is challenging for models.

1. Introduction

The magnetic energy and helicity in the solar active regions
(ARs) are two important parameters for a quantitative study of
magnetic origins of solar eruptions. The ﬁeld lines in a closed
magnetic structure of the corona have foot points rooted in the
photospheric boundary. During AR emergence and their evolu-
tion, the lower boundary acts as a driver of the evolution in the
structure either via boundary ﬂows or via the injection of addi-
tional structure through it.

Magnetic helicity is a metric describing the volumetric com-
plexity like twist and shear magnetic ﬁeld of the AR. It is a well
conserved quantity even in non-ideal cases and its injection, un-
der ideal conditions, through boundary-like photosphere, S , is
derived (Berger & Field 1984; Finn & Antonsen 1985) as

where Ap is the vector potential of the potential ﬁeld Bp com-
puted from the photospheric Bn distribution, Bt and Bn are the
tangential and normal magnetic ﬁelds, and vt and vn are the tan-
gential and normal components of the plasma velocity v. This
relation identiﬁes that the magnetic helicity in the corona pri-
marily originates from the twisted magnetic ﬂux tubes emerging
from the solar interior into the corona (ﬁrst term; vn term here-
after), and is further generated by shearing and braiding the ﬁeld
lines by the tangential motions on the solar surface (second term;
vt term). While ﬂux is emerging, using a geometrical relation of

the apparent horizontal foot point velocity of ﬁeld lines (u; ﬂux
transport velocity) with the plasma velocity (v) implies the rela-
tion

With this equation Démoulin & Berger (2003) combined the two
terms in Eq. (1) to measure helicity ﬂux using the observations
of line-of-sight magnetic ﬁelds at the photosphere with only the
knowledge of Bn and u.

Equation (1) with the help of (2) can be written as (Berger

1988; Pariat et al. 2005);

is the relative angular velocity between ﬁeld line foot points lo-
cated at x and x(cid:48). Here the helicity ﬂux dH/dt is the summa-
tion over all the photospheric elementary ﬂux pairs of their net
angular rotation around each other weighted by Bn.B(cid:48)

ample, if two positive (negative) end points rotate counter-clock
wise (dθ/dt > 0) then their net contribution to dH/dt is nega-
tive and consequently the ﬁeld lines above becomes twisted in a
left-handed sense.

Employing a technique for deriving ﬂow velocity, the dif-
ferential aﬃne velocity estimator for vector magnetograms
(DAVE4VM; Schuck 2008), Liu & Schuck (2012) recently
found that Equations (1) and (3) are not yielding identical re-
sults when applied to photospheric observations. Then, they sug-
gested to calculate individual terms in Eq. (1). With that, on re-
expansion of Eq. (3) with Eq. (2) yields

where Gθ, vn and Gθ, vt denote helicity ﬂux distribution due to vn
and vt terms as in Eq. (1). The above equation includes helicity
injection due to apparent relative rotation of elementary polarity
with regard to surrounding polarities and due also to inherent
twist while ﬂux emerges from sub-photosphere.

Observational studies on quantitative estimates of dH/dt
from Eq. (3) , or equivalent formula, were carried out to reveal
the role of helicity in the eruptive nature of ARs (Chae 2001;
Démoulin et al. 2002; Kusano et al. 2002; Moon et al. 2002;
Chae et al. 2004; LaBonte et al. 2007). Few studies claim that
the monotonous accumulation of helicity in the corona comes
from magnetic domains with uniform signed distribution of he-
licity ﬂux and therefore are prone to launch coronal mass ejec-
tions (Pariat et al. 2006; Vemareddy et al. 2012a,b). On the other
hand, domains with opposite signed distribution of helicity ﬂux
were speculated to be related to more energetic events as they
can liberate more free energy since the system can relax to a
more potential ﬁeld (Chandra et al. 2010; Romano et al. 2011;
Vemareddy et al. 2012b).

Since the magnetic helicity is not a local quantity, the he-
licity ﬂux distribution is only meaningful when one considers a
whole elementary ﬂux tube rather than its individual foot points
(Pariat et al. 2005). As a consequence, the earlier interpretations
of observed activity based on computed helicity ﬂux distribution
remains speculative.

Considering the whole elementary ﬂux tube, Pariat et al.
(2005) deﬁned an improved helicity ﬂux distribution assuming
information of coronal connectivity (inferred from a model). The
new ﬂux density of helicity writes

where c denotes a closed elementary ﬂux tube with foot points at
xc± in the photosphere. The factor 1/2 present in the above equa-
tion assumes that the helicity is injected equally between the two
footpoints of each ﬁeld line (see Pariat et al. 2005, for a more
general case). Recently, this helicity ﬂux proxy was tested using
analytical case studies and numerical simulations by Dalmasse

et al. (2014) and they observationally found evidence for the ex-
istence of opposite signed helicity ﬂux distribution in the ﬂaring
AR 11158 (Dalmasse et al. 2013).

Present study is an attempt towards further understanding the
distribution of helicity injection ﬂux in an emerging AR. In an
extensive study of three emerging ARs Vemareddy (2015) found
corresponding signatures of helicity ﬂux distribution Gθ with
the observed activity. We consider here one of their cases, AR
11928, and computed the connectivity-based helicity ﬂux distri-
bution (GΦ) at successive stages of evolution to explore its nature
and a possible physical signiﬁcance. Data sets and methodology
are given in Sect. 2, results are presented in Sect. 3. A discussion
of the results is made in Sect. 4.

2. Observations and Employed Procedure

The studied AR 11928 appeared on 16 December 2013 at a loca-
tion of E40oS15o on the solar disk. It emerged progressively and
evolved to a leading major positive polarity sunspot and follow-
ing plage group regions of negative polarity. We covered this AR
evolution with 12-minute cadence magnetograms for four days
since its emergence.

The required photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld observa-
tions (B, at a resolution of 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)per pixel) are obtained from
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012)
on board Solar Dynamic Observatory. HMI science team had
pipe-lined the process of retrieving vector ﬁeld information from
ﬁltergrams (Hoeksema et al. 2014, and references therein) and
made the direct usable vector products (hmi.sharp.cea.720s)
available to solar community. The pipeline procedure involves
inversion of stokes vectors using the very fast inversion of the
Stokes vector algorithm (Borrero et al. 2011; Centeno et al.
2014) based on the Milne-Eddington atmospheric model and
removing 180o azimuthal ambiguity using minimum energy
method (Metcalf et al. 1995; Leka et al. 2009). The projection
eﬀects in the ﬁeld components in the cutout area are corrected by
transforming to disk center using the cylindrical equal area pro-
jection method (Calabretta & Greisen 2002; Bobra et al. 2014).
Detailed documentation on the pipeline processing of HMI mag-
netic ﬁeld data, including various data artifacts, is available in
Hoeksema et al. (2014).

From these vector magnetic ﬁeld observations, we ﬁrst de-
rived the ﬂow velocity (v) by employing DAVE4VM technique,
then the ﬂux transport velocity (u) with DAVE technique. Then,
we calculated Gθ(x) (Pariat et al. 2006; Liu & Schuck 2012; Ve-
mareddy 2015). For connectivity information of foot points, we
performed nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation by
an optimization procedure involving minimization of Lorentz
force and divergence conditions (Wiegelmann 2004; Wiegel-
mann & Inhester 2010, and also see Vemareddy & Wiegelmann
2014). The photospheric boundary conditions are derived from
the vector magnetic ﬁeld observations after pre-processing in
order to satisfy force-free conditions the best possible (Wiegel-
mann et al. 2006). We embedded the lower boundary ﬁeld in a
large null array to minimize eﬀect of lateral boundaries. We then
re-binned the data by a factor two to have a reasonable compu-
tation time. Having done these systematic procedures, we ob-
tained 3D magnetic ﬁeld in an uniform spacing Cartesian grid
of 400 × 400 × 256 corresponding to physical dimensions of
292 × 292 × 187 Mm3 encompassing the AR. Given well known
diﬃculties to construct 3D ﬁelds from boundary ﬁeld observa-
tions (e.g., De Rosa et al. 2009), we regard these NLFFF extrap-
olations as an approximation to the coronal magnetic ﬁelds of
this AR.

Fig. 1. HMI magnetic and deduced velocity ﬁelds of AR 11928 at diﬀerent times. In all the panels, the background of grey levels shows the
vertical component, Bz, of the magnetic ﬁeld and contours of Bz ± 120 G and the magnitude of the transverse vectors is indicated by the light blue
segment located in the top left of each panel. Left panels: Vector magnetic ﬁeld observations (blue/red arrows above positive/negative Bz values).
Vectors point to horizontal ﬁeld direction and their length corresponds to the horizontal ﬁeld magnitude (a zoom on a computer screen is needed
to better view these arrows). Right panels: The horizontal velocity vectors (Vh) are shown with blue arrows. The velocity pattern in the leading
polarity indicates the presence of a counter-clock rotating motion of the magnetic elements on 19 and 20 December 2013. The ﬁeld-of-view is a
portion of actual observation indicated with white rectangular box in Fig. 2a.

We adopted the procedure detailed in Dalmasse et al. (2013)
to compute GΦ from Eq. (6). First we traced ﬁeld lines hav-
ing one foot point in a polarity region (xc+/xc−) and found the
corresponding conjugate foot point (xc−/xc+) after landing to the
boundary at z = 0. Having foot point coordinates of all ﬁeld lines
in a magnetic structure of AR, we implement Eq. (6) by using a
bi-linear interpolation. Traced ﬁeld lines that touch the lateral
boundaries are considered as open-like. In all our magnetogram
sequence, the fraction of open-like ﬁeld lines found is up to 10%
and the redistribution of helicity density, Eq. (6), is not applied
as connectivity is undeﬁned for them.

3. Results

3.1. Global Evolution

AR 11928 initially emerges with a bipolar ﬁeld distribution and
evolves to a large leading positive polarity sunspot and a more
dispersed following negative polarity. In Fig. 1, we plot the vec-
tor magnetograms at diﬀerent times in the local solar frame (lo-
cal horizontal and vertical directions) after the transformation
from the observed frame. For both velocity and magnetic ﬁelds,
the horizontal ﬁeld component is plotted with arrows indicating
the direction and magnitude. The background is the map of the
vertical magnetic ﬁeld component (Bz). These panels show the
emergence of small bipoles which are the consequence of the
development of the undulatory instability or of the upward con-
vective motions, creating a sea-serpent conﬁguration with mag-
netic dips (e.g. Pariat et al. 2004; Valori et al. 2012). The op-
posite polarities diverge and the like polarities coalesce to form

strong concentrated spots, of opposite magnetic polarity which
separate as the AR evolves in time. This evolution is typical for
AR emergence (van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015). While these
prominent polarities are in separating motion, a reverse orienta-
tion bipole, larger than others, forms and develops in the mid-
dle of the AR (panel at 19/12:00 UT in Fig. 1). This creates
a complex magnetic topology for the AR coronal conﬁguration
(Fig. 2c). This bipole progressively disappeared with time (e.g.,
the bottom panel at 20/06:00 UT in Fig. 1).

In order to compare the NLFF model for the coronal ﬁeld,
we plot the ﬁeld lines on AIA 171 Å observations in Figure 3.
Field lines in the core of the AR globally resemble the coronal
loops. However, a closer look shows also some deviations (e.g.
the computed ﬁeld lines are more symmetric in the East-West
direction than the observed loops as some show a sharp bend
near the leading polarity). Such deviations could have several
origins. This could be due to the missing electric currents in the
magnetograms due to a too coarse spatial resolution not able to
resolve their magnetic structures. This eﬀect is further increased
by the rebinning procedure applied to the magnetograms in order
to achieve feasible computing times (e.g. De Rosa et al. 2015).
Moreover, convergence to a NLFF ﬁeld with a small divergence
for the magnetic ﬁeld is another issue (e.g. Wiegelmann et al.
2012). Finally, the involved assumptions with the boundary ob-
servations are not yet settled (e.g., the magnetograms are not in
a fully force-free region in contrast to the equations solved in the
coronal volume, De Rosa et al. 2009). All these issues contribute
to the deviations of the model ﬁeld lines with the actual observa-
tions. Despite all these limitations we obtained a coherent global
resemblance between modeled ﬁeld lines and the coronal loops
over the entire AR evolution.

In order to examine the magnetic helicity ﬂux, we derived the
photospheric velocity ﬁeld by employing DAVE4VM method on
these time sequence of vector magnetic ﬁeld observations. The
horizontal velocity ﬁeld at diﬀerent stages is plotted on the Bz
map in the right panels of Fig. 1. The velocities are typically up
to 0.9 km/s and earlier on they are dominantly translational in the
leading polarity. However, by December 18 onwards, the veloc-
ity vectors in the leading positive polarity indicate the presence
of an anticlockwise rotating motion especially in the southern
portion of the leading polarity. This motion becomes prominent
in later time while separation motion continues (see the three
right bottom panels of Fig. 1).

In Fig. 2, we plot the extrapolated magnetic structure of AR
11928 at diﬀerent stages of evolution. The ﬁeld lines are repre-
sented with a color scale of horizontal ﬁeld strength. The mag-
netic structure is non-potential in the early emergence phase and
becomes more relaxed as AR evolves. December 18 onwards,
the ﬁeld structure appears close to potential ﬁeld, globally con-
necting the leading and following polarities. Due to the forma-
tion of a reverse orientation bipolar region in between the sepa-
rating leading and following polarity, a low lying bipolar struc-
ture exists in the December 19 frames.

We derived the net vertical magnetic ﬂux Φ

The ﬂux of both polarities predominantly increases in time
owing to the emergence of these ﬂux regions. This AR has an
almost constant rate of ﬂux emergence which is not so frequent
(e.g., see examples in Poisson et al. 2015). The observed activity
is limited to GOES class C without coronal mass ejections
(CMEs). However, jet like ejections often occurred during the
AR evolution.

where µ0 = 4π×10−7H m−1. Partial derivatives are approximated
by a three-point Lagrangian interpolation procedure. The net
current in each polarity is much more time varying both in mag-
nitude and sign than the magnetic ﬂux (Fig. 4a,b). The current
proﬁles show prominent variations with a time scale of around
12 hours, while they are small in the magnetic ﬂux proﬁles. They
are due to orbital rotation of the SDO spacecraft, and are also
seen in other active region studies (Hoeksema et al. 2014). There
is also a longer time scale variation at the scale of a day which is
comparable in the north and south polarities (as expected if the
ﬁeld is force-free). The absolute value of both currents ﬁrst reach
maximum at 02:00 UT on December 18 (2 × 1012A in the north
polarity and −1.8 × 1012A in south one). Later on the net cur-
rents exhibit a counter evolution, then they both change in sign

at 22:00 UT on December 18 and with again a reversal in sign
around the end of December 19.

Since the positive/negative magnetic polarity is predomi-
nantly due to leader/follower polarity, we can also interpret
the current evolution in terms of unbalanced current in the
leader/following polarity. For that, we separately compute the
positive (I+) and negative currents (I−) in each polarity and
compared their absolute values in Fig. 4c,d. Those currents are
about a factor 10 larger in magnitude than those described before
(Fig. 4b). The ratio of positive and negative current varies within
0.82-1.33 in the leader polarity, and within 0.83-1.18 in the fol-
lower polarity, then there is nearly neutralization of currents in
each magnetic polarities. This is due to a small magnetic shear
along the main AR inversion line (Fig. 1, left panels) as shown
by Dalmasse et al. (2015).

Fig. 5. Time evolution of αav (deﬁned by Eq. 7) in the entire AR 11928.
The error bars are obtained from a least square regression procedure in
the plot of Jz and Bz (see Eq. 8). αav changes sign several times at the
beginning of the emergence, as well as later on when the AR is well
developed at 18T22:00 UT (vertical line).

We next investigate the mean evolution of α = Jz/Bz called
αav. It is a proxy for the average twist of the AR ﬁeld lines
(Hagino & Sakurai 2004). Using the three components of vec-
tor magnetic ﬁeld, we compute this parameter as

αav =

(cid:80) Jz(x, y)sign[Bz(x, y)]
(cid:80) |Bz|

If the positive and negative magnetic ﬂuxes are in balance, the
above equation is equivalent to

over the two polarities. It is an estima-
which is the mean of
tion of how twisted is the magnetic conﬁguration. Since Eq. (7)
corresponds to the usual least-squares ﬁt assuming a linear re-
gression Jz = αavBz, the error in αav is estimated by

The time variation of αav is shown in Fig. 5 with the error
bars indicating ±δαav. Just like the net current in the early emer-
gence phase (Fig. 4b), αav changes sign four times. This is likely
due to the limited spatial resolution since the AR has a low spa-
tial extension at that times. After 04:00 UT on December 17,
it remains positive with signiﬁcant variations till 22:00 UT on
December 18 (vertical line), from which time it turns negative,
reversing of sign again by the end of December 19. αav is indeed
related to the current distribution in the AR but with a diﬀerent
weighting in the summation than for the net currents.

3.3. Helicity Flux

The ﬂux density of magnetic helicity is computed with the
method recalled in Sect. 1. Figure 6 shows the helicity ﬂux distri-
bution at four times of Fig. 1. Gθ distribution (left column panels)
shows both positive and negative values. The distribution has a
range of ﬂux exceeding ±1 × 1019 Mx2 cm−2 s−1, but we scaled
the maps within these values. A dominant positive signal is per-
sistent mostly within the leading positive sunspot till 06:00 UT
on December 18, by which time the sunspot got well separated
from the following polarity. In the later stages, strong negative
signal with the leading sunspot kept increasing in magnitude.

On December 17 and 18, the magnetic polarities are elon-
gated and are globally resembling a yin yang pattern. These ob-
served features, called magnetic tongues, are produced by the
azimuthal ﬁeld component of the emerging ﬂux rope projected
on the vertical direction (see e.g. Poisson et al. 2015). They
are present when the magnetic ﬂux is growing as long as the
top horizontal portion of the twisted ﬂux tube is crossing the
photosphere. The magnetic-ﬂux distribution due to the magnetic
tongues is directly related to the sign of the twist in the emerg-
ing AR (see Fig. 1 in Luoni et al. 2011). In AR 11928 mag-
netic tongues on December 17 and 18 indicates a positive twist
in agreement with the positive helicity ﬂux. In contrast, the neg-
ative helicity ﬂux observed next has no trace on the distribution
of the vertical ﬁeld component.

Having deﬁned connectivity from NLFFF extrapolation
(Sect. 2, Fig. 2), the computed GΦ distribution is shown in the
right column of Fig. 6. It is computed with Eq. (6) when the
ﬁeld line is closed within the computation box, otherwise the
local value Gθ is kept. Since ﬁeld lines from the leader sunspot
connect to the following polarity, the dominant helicity ﬂux from
the leading sunspot redistributes to the following polarity regions
by means of Eq. (6). Since the helicity ﬂux is larger in absolute
value in the leading polarity than the following ones, the GΦ dis-
tribution is also negative in the following polarity on 19 Decem-
ber and later on.

In Fig. 7a, we plot the summation of Gθ and GΦ over the
entire AR with respect to time. Both Gθ and GΦ proﬁles have
undergone a smoothing window of 7 successive data points. The
time proﬁles of Gθ and GΦ ﬂuxes are correlated to a high ac-
curacy (Fig. 7a) as expected from the redistribution which the-
oretically preserves the total helicity ﬂux (Pariat et al. 2005).
The net helicity ﬂux increases from zero to a maximum value of
8.5 × 10−37 Mx2 cm−2 s−1 at 18:00 UT on December 17. Ow-
ing to the change in sign of Gθ and GΦ (Fig. 6), the helicity ﬂux
then decreases toward near zero values. Next, it turns to negative
value at 00:20 UT on December 20. This helicity time proﬁle has
similar variations than the net current proﬁles in both polarities
(Fig. 4b, taking into account that the current sign is reverse in the
following negative polarity) and to αav (Fig. 5) except diﬀerent
relative amplitudes and a time delay (between 2.5 and 7 h de-
pending if the reversal or the extremums are taken into account).

Fig. 6. Snapshots of helicity ﬂux distributions with Gθ
maps (left column) and GΦ maps (right column) at four
diﬀerent times of the evolution of AR 11928. GΦ is de-
rived from Gθ taking into account the connectivity of
the ﬁeld line foot points (Eq. (6)). Intense positive he-
licity ﬂux in Gθ maps is associated with the leading ma-
jor sunspot polarity, which turns to negative over the
time. This ﬂux is re-distributed to the following polar-
ity ﬂux by closed ﬁeld lines in GΦ maps. In all pan-
els, contours of Bz at ±120 G (black/white) are over
plotted. All maps were scaled with grey levels within
±1 × 10−19 Mx2 cm−2 s−1. Axes units are in arc-second
and the ﬁeld-of-view is same as indicated by the black
dashed rectangle in Fig. 2a. The rectangular white box
in the top left panel refers to the ﬁeld-of-view of the
panels in Figure 1.

The net Gθ ﬂux is dominated by the vt term (Eq. (5)) over vn
by a factor of about six, so the helicity ﬂux evolution is mostly
related to horizontal boundary motions (see Fig. 6 of Vemareddy
2015). Still, we do observed a similar ﬂux proﬁles for the vt
and vn terms. Moreover, while this separation in vn and vt terms
was studied in many previous publications, its physical relevance
is doubtful since each term is not separately gauge invariant in
Eq. (1) and a particular gauge was used to derive Eq. (5) (Pariat
et al. 2015).

Furthermore, we separately computed net helicity ﬂux of GΦ
from north (GΦ, N) and south (GΦ, S ) polarity regions. The un-
derlying assumption here is that the net GΦ, N and GΦ, S ﬂuxes
should be equal provided exact connectivity for every polarity
pixel, i.e., closed ﬂux system in the AR. From yellow and green
curves of Fig. 7a, their time proﬁles have approximately equal
trend till 18:00 UT on December 18, 2013. After that they ex-
hibit noticeable deviation, with dominant helicity ﬂux from north
(leading) polarity. With increasingly separation, the open ﬁeld
lines (those reaching top/lateral boundaries) from leader polarity
increases, then a full redistribution is not applicable and there-
fore dominant negative helicity ﬂux from N-polarity after 19 De-
cember.

Next, we separately computed the net GΦ ﬂux from north,
GΦ, N, and south, GΦ, S , polarity regions separating the positive
and negative contributions (Fig. 7b). This shows that the helicity
ﬂux is a mix of positive and negative contributions with two main

phases: a positive injection followed, about 2 days later, by a
negative injection from both polarities.

We also compute Gθ from the horizontal velocity ﬁeld, u,
derived from DAVE (Schuck 2005) using line-of-sight magne-
tograms. We obtained LOS magnetic ﬁeld observations from
HMI and we align them to the time of the central meridian pas-
sage by removing the diﬀerential rotation. The helicity ﬂux is
computed with Eqs. (3,4). Its time proﬁle (dH/dt)DAVE is shown
in Fig. 8 in a comparison to (dH/dt)DAVE4VM. Both proﬁles are
well correlated in time. However, they diﬀer signiﬁcantly in
magnitude at most times. Despite that, the sign reversal time of
net helicity ﬂux in both methods agree within 2.3 hours. (For
DAVE4VM the reversal is at 19T00:20 UT while for DAVE it is
at 18T22:00 UT).

The accumulated helicity in the corona over time is given by

H(t) =

(dH/dt) dt .

Since the magnitude of magnetic helicity is proportional to
square of the magnetic ﬂux (Berger & Field 1984), to compare
magnetic helicity with other ARs, we plotted in Fig. 8b the nor-
malized helicity (H(t)/Φ2) where Φ is the average AR ﬂux be-
tween polarities (Φ = (|ΦS | + |ΦN|)/2). It indicates how much
the magnetic conﬁguration is twisted/sheared, because for a uni-
formly twisted ﬂux tube with n turns, the helicity H is equal to

n Φ2, where Φ is its axial ﬂux. In our case, the absolute value of
the normalized helicity is less than 0.07 turns before and after H
reversal. These values are in comparison with previous AR stud-
ies having a minimum of 0.01 to a maximum of 0.2 (see for a
review Démoulin & Pariat 2009). The sign reversal of this quan-
tity, for both DAVE and DAVE4VM procedures, is well after the
reversal of dH/dt (19T18:00UT) because it requires time to can-
cel pre-accumulated positive helicity by pumping negative quan-
tity. Since the positive and negative H injections are realized in
almost the same magnetic structures (Fig. 6), the helicity cance-
lation can occur, as the negative injection is occurring, without
the need of magnetic reconnection (between independent ﬂux
tubes).

4. Discussion

Solar magnetic ﬁelds, upon their emergence, are driven by pho-
tospheric plasma motions governed by the induction equation.
Consequently the coronal magnetic helicity, which plays prime
role in most of the activity, is generated by these photospheric
motions. In the present work, we studied the time evolution of
connectivity based helicity ﬂux of an emerging AR associated
only to weak ﬂaring activity.

Reconstruction of coronal magnetic ﬁeld every 12 minutes
using observed ﬁeld is a computationally expensive task. More-
over, several issues of the NLFFF modeling of the coronal ﬁeld
with observed photospheric boundary data are still not fully
solved (see Sect. 3.1). The implications of these issues for helic-
ity studies can be checked by comparing the helicity ﬂux maps
and the helicity ﬂuxes derived with and without involving the
computed coronal connectivities. Finally, the derived results are
useful for studying helicity ﬂux maps in relation to coronal ac-
tivity as the studied AR shows.

The helicity ﬂux derived from the photospheric velocities de-
rived from DAVE4VM changes from positive to negative sign
around the end of December 18. Helicity ﬂux derived from
DAVE method also exhibits a similar evolution proﬁle. The evo-

Article number, page 8 of 10

lution of average twist (αav) has a comparable evolution but de-
layed in time by few hours (up to 7), a delay needed to accu-
mulate enough coronal magnetic helicity. At the photosphere,
plasma motions drive magnetic ﬁelds, so the observed evolution
of αav is most likely caused by these boundary evolution. Recent
reports (e.g. Vemareddy et al. 2012a, and references therein)
also delineate such a relation of sunspot rotation with the nature
of helicity of magnetic ﬁelds.

The coronal consequences of the change of helicity ﬂux sign
is present in the observed coronal loops which are tracing part
of the magnetic structure. We examined the AIA coronal obser-
vations obtained in 94 and 171 Å wavelengths. In Fig. 9, we
plot them at four diﬀerent time instances. During the evolution
till end of 18 December, the coronal loops exhibit a S-shape
morphology (e.g. the dotted line in Fig. 9 frames). This is also
well present when comparing the observed coronal loops to a
potential ﬁeld extrapolation represented with the same viewing
point. This indicates a positive magnetic helicity in agreement
with the mild clock-wise motions detected in leading polarity
and the positively oriented magnetic tongues observed with the
vertical ﬁeld component (Fig. 1). Next, from 19 December on-
wards, the magnetic elements within the leading sunspot present
counter-clock motions. As a response, the coronal structure be-
comes more potential like.

The proﬁle of normalized helicity H/Φ2 also is in the line of
these coronal observations. Its maximum value is 0.07 turns so
it is equivalent in term of magnetic helicity to a weakly twisted
ﬂux tube. The injection of opposite helicity in the same mag-
netic structures in the GΦ maps is an indication of cancellation
of coronal helicity by the negative injection later on. In fact the
coronal loops are not far from potential ﬁeld at 19T18:00UT.

A further clue comes from the observed activity. Rather than
helicity injection of opposite sign, if helicity injection would
have continue to be positive its storage in the corona would have
build an increasingly stressed magnetic ﬁeld which is a good
candidate to become unstable and launch a CME. However, the
observed activity is limited to C-class ﬂares and jets so that the

heating, rather than building a ﬂux rope which is expected to
erupt as a CME at some point of the evolution.

In order to follow the coronal ﬂaring activity we computed
EUV 94 and 171 Å ﬂuxes integrated within the AR with 3 minute
cadence. These ﬂuxes (F94, F171) are normalized by mean mag-
netic line-of-sight ﬂux to suppress the increased EUV ﬂux due
to magnetic ﬂux becoming larger (e.g. see Démoulin 2004, and
references therein). Next, we scaled the ﬂuxes by an appropriate
constant value to plot them on the same graph because the evolu-
tion trend is the only required observable for the following analy-
sis. Time proﬁles of these ﬂuxes are plotted in Fig. 10. Enhanced
emissions in both F94 and F171 are present after the sign rever-
sal of the magnetic helicity ﬂux (indicated by a vertical solid
black line). The short time peaks of F94 are due to C-class ﬂares

passband detects hot emission (≈ 6 MK) near soft X-ray range
(1-100 Å). The F171 enhancement is more continuous, without
peaks, indicating less hot emission over the entire AR (Fig. 9).
The coronal helicity cancellation is realized progressively by the
continuous injection of opposite helicity ﬂux (Fig. 8a). There-
fore the enhancement of F94 and F171 ﬂuxes is continuing well
after mid of 19 Dec.

In summary, the evolution of AR 11928 is peculiar compare
to most of ARs studied previously since the positive H injection
is followed by the larger negative injection in the same emerg-
ing magnetic structure. The initial positive injection is supported
by DAVE, DAVE4VM, αav, the magnetic tongues and the shape
of coronal loops. The negative injection is supported by DAVE,
DAVE4VM, αav and the shape of coronal loops which become
more potential. This AR provides an example of magnetic en-
ergy due to cancelation of magnetic helicities of opposite sign.
Of course in present AR the maximum value of H/Φ2 is modest
so the amount of available magnetic energy is also modest.

Finally, these results suggest a scenario of an emerging ﬂux
tube with helicity distribution changing sign over its length. This
could have been created in the convective zone by a vortex lo-
cally rotating the magnetic ﬂux tube which, by conservation of
H, creates both H > 0 and H < 0 on the sides of the rotated re-
gion. In order to answer whether it is an isolated case or whether
it reveals a relatively common convective zone process, the study
of a much broader sample of emerging ARs is needed.
