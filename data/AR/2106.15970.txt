Abstract

A systematic study is performed to measure the ion backﬂow fraction of

the GEM detectors. The eﬀects of diﬀerent voltage conﬁgurations and Ar/CO2

gas mixtures, in ratios of 70:30, 80:20 and 90:10, on positive ion fraction are

investigated in detail. Moreover, a comparative study is performed between

single and quadruple GEM detectors.The ion current with detector eﬀective

gain is measured with various ﬁeld conﬁgurations and with three proportions of

gas mixtures. The ion backﬂow fraction for the GEM is substantially reduced

with the lower drift ﬁeld. A minimum ion backﬂow fraction of 18 % is achieved in

the single GEM detector with Ar/CO2 80:20 gas mixture, however, a minimum

ion backﬂow fraction of 3.5 %, 3.0%, and 3.8 % are obtained for a drift ﬁeld of

0.1kV/cm with Ar/CO2 70:30, 80:20 and 90:10 gas mixtures, respectively for

quadrupole GEM detector. Similar values of eﬀective gain and ion backﬂow

fraction have been found by calculating the current from pulse height spectrum

method, obtained in the Multi Channel Analyser.

1. Introduction

The concept of the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector was introduced

in 1997 by Fabio Sauli [1, 2]. Some of the major advantages of the GEM de-

tectors are its excellent spatial resolution, good energy resolution, high particle

rate capability and long term stability [3, 4, 5, 6]. In recent years, Gas Elec-

tron Multiplier (GEM) detector has been a preferred choice for many High

Energy Physics Experiments like COMPASS experiment at CERN [6], STAR,

and PHENIX experiment at RHIC [7, 8]. GEM has also been proposed for

components of the International Heavy Ion Collider [9] and the Facility for An-

tiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI [10, 11, 12]. These GEM detectors are

also being included in the upgrade of the CMS and ALICE experiments [13, 14].

Ion backﬂow (IB) refers to the ﬂow of the positive ions, that result from the

electron avalanches inside the gas, towards the drift region. Thus the electric

ﬁeld, that should remain uniform for most of the cases, is distorted due to the

presence of the positive ions in the drift region.

The deﬁnition of ion backﬂow fraction [15] is the ratio of the cathode current

due to positive ions to the anode current due to electrons. The positive ions

ﬂowing back into the drift region create a space charge eﬀect that aﬀects the

normal operation of the detector and results in performance degradation of the

detector [16, 17, 18]. So, the reduction of ion backﬂow fraction is important for

stable detector operation. The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and gas-ﬁlled

photomultiplier (GPMT) are a few examples in which the detector is sensitive to

IB. For example, in TPC the particle tracks are reconstructed by assuming that

the drift ﬁeld is uniform for estimating the x, y, z position of each voxel. The

speciﬁc energy loss (dE/dx) and the position resolution depend on the amount

of IB. Similarly, in case of GPMT the IB is an obstacle for its operation at higher

gains. Therefore, an active gate electrode is introduced between the successive

GEM elements for blocking the avalanche-induced ions.

GEM can operate with diﬀerent gas mixtures and can reach eﬀective gain in

the order of 102 - 103, for a single layer ampliﬁcation. To achieve further high

2

gain, multiple layers of GEM can be coupled with the advantage of minimum

discharge probability and lower spark rate [19, 20]. These result in maximising

the avalanche process in the last GEM foil. Most of the created ions are collected

on the top copper layer of the GEM foil during their drift path. Hence, fewer

ions are capable of reaching the cathode and this results in minimising the ion

backﬂow fraction.

We have used both single and quadruple GEM detectors to study the ion

backﬂow fraction for these two diﬀerent geometries and also with diﬀerent

Ar/CO2 mixture.

The paper is organised as follows: In section 2, the experimental conﬁgura-

tion with diﬀerent conﬁgurations of detectors is described in detail. The results,

for the optimisation of gain and ion backﬂow fraction values for both single and

quadruple GEM prototype, are discussed in section 3. Here, the eﬀects of the gas

mixing ratio on detector performance are also presented. Finally, the conclusion

is given in the last section.

2. Experimental Conﬁguration

In this study Fe55 X-ray source is used for measuring the eﬀective gain and

ion backﬂow. The X-ray source is placed at a ﬁxed position on the top of

the kapton window of the GEM detector to avoid any spatial eﬀect. The two

quantities eﬀective gain and ion backﬂow fraction are deﬁned as follows. The

eﬀective gain of the detector is deﬁned as the anode current divided by the

primary ionisation current in Eq.1. The ion backﬂow fraction is represented as

the cathode current divided by the anode current in Eq.2.

In Eq.1, ’R’ is the maximum count rate of the radioactive source, ’n’ is the

count rate R is measured with a scaler counter [21] for the diﬀerent gas ratios

with both detectors conﬁguration.

The speciﬁcation of GEM foil with the standard pitch equal to 140 µm having

an active area of 10 ×10 cm2. The GEM foils used in the set-up are obtained

from CERN and assembled in the cleanroom locally. The drift plane is a 50 µm

kapton foil with a copper layer of 5 µm on one side which faces the top of GEM,

and the readout plane is a two dimensional PCB with 128 readout pads each of

area ∼ 9×9 mm2. All the pads are connected to 128 pin connectors. A sum-up

board from CERN with a female lemo output is used to add the signals from

all pads.

The measurements are done with the diﬀerent gas ratios at Ar/CO2 70:30,

80:20, and 90:10 and constant gas ﬂow rate, temperature, pressure, and relative

humidity throughout the experiment.

2.1. Experimental Set-up

In this paper, we plan to measure ion backﬂow fraction for two set-ups, a

single GEM and a quadruple GEM. In the beginning, the scanning is done with

diﬀerent voltage conﬁgurations, which is then extended by taking various gas

mixture proportions. The detector architecture along with electronics arrange-

ment for the ion backﬂow fraction measurements are discussed below.

The whole set-up along with the readout is placed on a copper plate and

properly grounded. The schematic diagram for the GEM set-up is given in Figs.

1 and 2. Each electrode, the drift plane, GEM top, and bottom are separately

connected to individual common ground HV (-HV1, -HV2, -HV3 and -HV4)

power supply module (CAEN N1470), the electronics set-up are as shown in

Figs. 1 and 2. The currents are measured from anode plane using Keithley

KE6485 [22] pico ammeter and from cathode using PicoLogic ammeter [23],

which is a ﬂoating device to ensure high voltage insulation. PicoLogic amme-

ter has a measuring range ±125 nA, ambient temperature 250 C, gain 0.0039

nA/ADC count, and sampling frequency 1 kHz and is suitable for operation

at a high voltage (up to ± 5kV) with respect to the ground. The full descrip-

4

tion is given in ref.

[23] and the connection are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. This

arrangement gives more freedom and ﬂexibility for operation with desired volt-

ages. High value (10 MΩ) resistors in series are used with the power supply

scheme to protect GEM foil from any damage during sudden discharge. Speciﬁc

voltages are set for diﬀerent voltage conﬁgurations, and the respective currents

are recorded from the PicoLogic ammeter. The anode current measurements

are taken from a Keithley pico ammeter connected in series from the readout.

All currents are measured when the switch 1 is connected to B and switch 2 is

connected to C in Figs. 1 and 2.

2.2. Single GEM detector

The single GEM set-up consists of a standard double mask GEM foil placed

in between a drift and an induction plane, the schematic diagram is shown in

Fig. 1. The GEM foil has standard dimensions of 10cm × 10cm with holes of

typically 70 µm in diameter at 140 µm pitch and has conductor on both sides.

The gap between the top of GEM foil and the drift cathode (drift plane) is

3.5mm and that between the readout anode (induction plane) and the bottom

of GEM foil is 2mm. The drift plane is a copper-clad Kapton foil while the

induction plane is realised on a printed circuit board. The whole assembly

is enclosed within a G10 frame equipped with gas inlet/outlet chamber and

provided with a Kapton window. As our primary goal is to minimise the ion

backﬂow fraction value for the GEM detector, we have done a scanning over

diﬀerent ﬁelds and GEM foil ampliﬁcation bias, ∆V (i.e., the voltage across top

and bottom of the GEM foils).

2.3. Quadrupole GEM detector

In quadrupole GEM detector four GEM foils are placed over one another

with the drift plane on the top and the readout PCB at the bottom. The

readout plane consists of 128 pads with equal area over the PCB for picking

up the signals. Here also the readout plane, GEM foils and the drift plane are

covered by a G10 frame provided by a window on the top which is covered by

high voltage connections at the drift plane, top and bottom layer of GEM with induction

plane is being grounded. Anode current reading is taken from a Keithley Pico ammeter.

a Kapton foil for maintaining the gas tightness in the chamber. The drift gap

(between the drift plane and GEM1), three transfer gaps (between the GEMs),

and the induction gap (between GEM4 and the induction plane) are made 3, 2,

2, 2, and 2 mm, respectively. The schematic diagram of the set-up is given in

Fig. 2.

For the quad GEM set-up, the drift plane and electrodes of the GEM4 are

biased with individual common ground power supply (HV N1470) -HV1, -HV3,

and -HV4 as shown in Fig. 2. For the distribution of correct voltages in the

rest of the electrodes, a voltage divider circuit is used (-HV2). The resistance

values are already mentioned in the schematic diagram. The diﬀerent voltage

conﬁgurations to the quad GEM are applied by pre-calculating the values of

the diﬀerent resistors in the detector, thus all the ﬁelds are determined in the

detector accordingly.

2.4. Working Principle

In the beginning, ultra-pure N2 (99.999 %) gas is passed through the detec-

tor, and gradually detector biasing is done to achieve conditioning at maximum

Figure 2: Schematics diagram of the quadruple GEM detector. The voltage scheme is designed

with four main high voltage connections at four electrodes i.e., at the drift, top layer of GEM1,

top, and bottom layers of GEM4. GEM3 bottom plane is grounded through a resistor and

the induction plane is grounded and acts as the anode. Anode current reading is taken from

a Keithley Pico ammeter.

stable operating voltage. Then Ar/CO2 gas mixture is passed through the

chamber with an optimised rate of ﬂow value throughout the experiment. For

both the set-ups, measurements are also done with the diﬀerent gas ratios at

Ar/CO2 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10 to determine the inﬂuence of the gas propor-

tions on the ion backﬂow fraction values. The experiment is sensitive to ambient

parameters such as gas ﬂow rate, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity.

Therefore, the corresponding gas ﬂow rates (11 SCCM), temperature (250C),

pressure (1000±3 mbar), and relative humidity (33%) are recorded with a data

logger[24, 25] and are maintained to be constant throughout the experiment.

As mentioned above, a sum-up board with a female lemo output connector is

used for extracting the signal, measuring total counts as well as anode current

from the readout plane. The electronic signal is ampliﬁed through a charge

sensitive pre-ampliﬁer and displayed in a digital oscilloscope as shown in Fig.

2, the same way as shown in Fig. 1 for single GEM detector, when the switch

1 is connected to A, switch 2 is connected to D and switch 3 is connected

to Z. A discriminator is used to reduce the electronic noise and it will form

the detector signal to a square pulse. The threshold voltage for single and

quadrupole GEM detectors are 1.1 V and 1.28 V, respectively. The extracted

signal is then fed to a scaler counter to measure count rates as shown in Figs. 1

for single GEM detector and Fig. 2 for quadrupole GEM detector when switch

1 is connected to A, switch 2 is connected to D, and switch 3 is connected to X.

For the measurement of anode current, we have connected the quadrupole GEM

detector output like a single GEM detector in Fig. 1 directly to a pico-ammeter

via a lemo cable, when switches 1 and 2 are connected to B and C, respectively,

in Fig. 2. The energy spectrum of single GEM and quadrupole GEM detectors

are obtained by connecting the switches 1, 2, and 3 to switches A, D, and Y,

respectively, in Figs. 1 and 2. Here the detector signal from the spectroscopic

ampliﬁer is fed to Multi Channel Analyser (MCA) directly with a threshold

values approximately 50mV for Single GEM and 250mV for quadruple GEM

detectors, respectively.

The count rate of the GEM detector is measured as a function of ∆V, which

8

is deﬁned as the GEM foil ampliﬁcation bias or voltage across top and bottom

GEM foils. The GEM prototype reached a plateau region after ∆V ∼ 380V =

for all three mixed Ar/CO2 gases in proportions of 70:30, 80:20 and 90:10. The

value of R is ∼ 48.5 kHz. The primary number of electrons is calculated and

it is about 212, 217, and 222 for Ar/CO2 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10 gas ratios,

respectively. The cathode and anode currents are measured with and without

the source for each voltage setting and with diﬀerent gas ratios. The anode

currents range from 0.02 nA to 0.4 nA without source and 0.08 nA to 3.6 nA

with source and the cathode currents vary from 0.01 nA to 0.08 nA without

source and from 0.02 nA to 0.75 nA with the source for single GEM detector.

For quadrupole GEM detector, the anode currents and cathode currents range

from 0.3 nA to 6 nA and 0.08 nA to 2 nA, respectively, without source and from

4 nA to 90 nA and 0.6 nA to 18 nA, respectively, with the source.

The drift ﬁeld is varied from 0.1 kV/cm to 0.8 kV/cm. As induction ﬁeld is

important for gain, a similar scan is done for 1 to 6 kV/cm.

The eﬀective gain values of the quadrupole GEM by measuring the anode

current from pico ammeter are similar to that of the values calculated the inte-

grated charge of the pulse height spectrum obtained by the MCA.

We ﬁrst calibrated the MCA, the calibration factor is 2.7 mV/ADC chan-

nel and then the signal is obtained by a sum-up board and a single input is

fed to a charge sensitive preampliﬁer, ORTEC 142AH with 20 mV/MeV charge

sensitivity. A spectroscopic ampliﬁer CAEN N968 is connected after the pream-

pliﬁer and the output signal from the ampliﬁer is fed to the MCA to obtain the

energy spectrum. The technical details and speciﬁcation of preampliﬁer, OR-

TEC 142AH, and ampliﬁer, CAEN N968 are given in the manuals [26, 27]. The

spectrum for single GEM detector with ampliﬁer gain 50 and quadrupole GEM

detector with ampliﬁer gain 30 are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, when the switches

1, 2 and 3 are connected to switches A, D and Y, respectively in Figs. 1 and 2.

In this work, a pre-mixed Ar/CO2 in 70:30 volume ratio has been used

and the drift ﬁeld and induction ﬁeld are kept at 0.4 kV/cm and 4 kV/cm,

respectively for quadrupole GEM detector. We have determined the eﬀective

9

gain and ion backﬂow fraction in this procedure for three diﬀerent values of ∆V

(330 V, 340 V, and 350 V) as given in Table 2.

First, we calculated the total area under the pulse height spectrum and con-

verted it into voltage using the calibration factor. This voltage is then converted

into charge using the energy sensitivity factor of the pre-ampliﬁer. This total

charge per unit time gives the current and the resultant current was found to

be comparable with the anode current obtained from the pico-ammeter. We

estimated the eﬀective gain from both the currents and the values agreed well

given in Table 2.

∆V=410 V. The induction ﬁeld and drift ﬁeld are kept constant at 4 kV/cm and 0.4 kV/cm,

respectively. There are two peaks for Fe55 X-ray source. The main photopeak is corresponding

to the 5.9 keV X-ray of Fe55 and the small peak is corresponding to the 2.9 keV Ar escape

peak.

3. Results

Charge transport properties in GEM mainly depends upon detector geome-

try, hole conﬁgurations, gas mixtures, and diﬀerent applied ﬁelds. Here we have

tried to understand the detector response with a single and quadruple GEM

detector. In the beginning single GEM is irradiated with 5.9 keV Fe55 source

and the measurements are taken with diﬀerent applied ﬁelds and gas mixtures

with the various quencher proportions.

3.1. Single GEM detector

The detector is biased in such a way that the induction ﬁeld is 4 kV/cm (a

popular choice for ALICE TPC; low ion backﬂow fraction), ∆V is 410 V, and

drift ﬁeld varies from 0.1 kV/cm to 0.6 kV/cm.

The eﬀective gain is calculated from the corresponding anode current, and a

comparison is made for three mixed Ar/CO2 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10 gas ratios

as shown in Fig. 5. For the same voltage settings, the cathode current is noted

and ion backﬂow fraction is calculated. Fig. 6 shows the eﬀects of drift ﬁeld

Ed on ion backﬂow fraction for the three diﬀerent gas mixtures. Eﬀective gain

increases as a function of induction ﬁelds. The eﬀective gains reach to a plateau

region after Ei > 4 kV/cm, for all three Ar/CO2 70:30, 80:20 and 90:10 gas

ratios.

Here, we see that eﬀective gain is increasing with Ed for Ar/CO2 70:30, 80:20

all gas ratio and on the other hand, ion backﬂow fraction rises linearly with

Ed [16]. It is because with increasing drift ﬁeld more electric ﬁeld lines end on

the drift plane giving rise to a higher value of cathode current. This, in turn,

increases the ion backﬂow fraction.

An optimum value of the drift ﬁeld is desired to create the primary number

of electrons and push them into the GEM holes. But here it is observed that,

after a particular value of the ﬁeld, the eﬀective gain is insensitive to change in

the drift ﬁeld. When we consider diﬀerent Ar/CO2 gas mixtures, the eﬀective

gain is maximum for a 90:10 ratio due to the maximum content of ionisation

component. On the same argument, the anode current value increases with Ar

content, we get minimum ion backﬂow fraction for this ratio.

The eﬀective gain and ion backﬂow fraction behaviour are also observed with

changing the induction ﬁeld by keeping the drift ﬁeld and GEM voltage constant.

Now the detector is biased in such a way that the drift ﬁeld is 0.4 kV/cm, ∆V

is 410 V, and the induction ﬁeld varies from 1 kV/cm to 6 kV/cm. To make a

comparison of the performances of diﬀerent gas mixtures, the eﬀective gain and

ion backﬂow fraction are displayed as a function of induction ﬁeld Ei in Fig. 7

and Fig. 8, respectively.

The eﬀective gain of the detector is calculated and plotted with applied

GEM voltage ∆V for diﬀerent gas mixtures by keeping Ed = 0.4 kV/cm and Ei

= 4kV/cm constant. It is observed that eﬀective gain increases exponentially

with ∆V and maximum eﬀective gain is recorded for Ar/CO2 90:10 ratio due to

less quencher content, as is shown in Fig. 9. Finally, to optimise our detector

set-up, we have plotted the ion backﬂow fraction with corresponding eﬀective

gain value by keeping ∆V =410 V for three gas ratios. This can be seen in Fig.

10. For Ar/CO2 70:30 ratio, the maximum eﬀective gain value is approximately

500, as we have varied the Ei value maximum up to 6 kV/cm. The decreasing

trend of the ion backﬂow fraction as a function of eﬀective gain is the same as

given in Ref.[16]. A minimum ion backﬂow fraction of 18% is achieved in the

single GEM set-up with Ar/CO2 80:20 gas at eﬀective gain around 1500 for this

3.2. Quadruple GEM detector

In the previous section, the operation of a single GEM prototype has been

investigated, and the role of ﬁelds along with gas mixture in diﬀerent ratios

has been discussed.

In the present section, the GEM prototype is operated

with diﬀerent voltage biasing schemes and the eﬀective gain with ion backﬂow

fraction values are optimised. The same 5.9 keV Fe55 radioactive source is used.

The primary purpose of our study is to optimise the values of ∆V, Ei, Ed and

eﬀective gain of the quadruple detector for the lowest possible value of the ion

backﬂow fraction for three Ar/CO2 gas ratios.

By looking at the results of a single GEM, we ﬁrst scan the detector with

ﬁeld variation which is then continued to study with diﬀerent gas mixtures.

In the beginning, the detector is biased as per the voltage settings, and then

eﬀective gain and ion backﬂow fraction value are calculated. The drift and

induction ﬁelds are kept as 0.4kV/cm and 4 kV/cm, respectively. The selected

16

ﬁeld ranges for the detector with diﬀerent gas mixtures are listed in Table 1.

Also, the eﬀective gain calculation from the pulse height spectrum obtained

from the MCA is done with a 70:30 gas ratio and the drift and induction ﬁelds

are kept at 0.4 kV/cm and 4 kV/cm, respectively, as shown in the Table 2.

The eﬀective gain increases exponentially with increasing ∆V. The qualitative

behavior is the same as that estimated by the current measurement method.

The GEM voltages ∆V are kept 320 V, 300 V and 270 V for Ar/CO2 gas ratio

70:30, 80:20 and 90:10, respectively. The eﬀective gain increases exponentially

with increasing ∆V for all gases, and the plot is shown in Fig. 11. The detector

is maintained at a constant eﬀective gain, and the variation of ion backﬂow

fraction value is then investigated. For the next measurements, the detector is

operated with voltages above 104 gain. For the higher proportion of ionising

gas, the detector is restricted for the working in higher ∆V regions. So, for

Ar/CO2 in 80:20 and 90:10 ratio, higher GEM voltage ∆V is not possible due

to the continuous occurrence of sparks. At a constant GEM voltage ∆V, the

eﬀective gain is maximum for Ar/CO2 90:10 ratio due to more ionisation and a

higher proportion of Ar.

The ion backﬂow

fraction is measured with the diﬀerent gas mixture and at various GEM voltages

∆V. The plots are given in Fig. 12 for Ar/CO2 70:30, in Fig. 13 for Ar/CO2

80:20 and in Fig. 14 for Ar/CO2 90:10, respectively. Here, it is observed that

with increasing drift ﬁeld, the ion backﬂow fraction increases [16], and at the

highest ∆V it shows a minimum value. So for the next optimisation, we have

kept the GEM voltage ∆V ﬁxed for each mixture, and a detailed study is done

over drift and induction ﬁelds. The GEM voltages ∆V are kept 320 V, 300

V, and 270 V for 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10 gas mixtures, respectively. The plots

are given in Figs. 15, 16, 17 for gases with increasing ionisation components.

In these ﬁgures, It is observed that for any ﬁxed value of Ei, the ion backﬂow

value increases with increasing values of Ed. Therefore, the low ion backﬂow

fraction values are observed from low drift regions as was also recorded a similar

trend from a single GEM detector. With increasing induction ﬁeld Ei, which is

responsible for high gain, the ion backﬂow fraction ratio for the quadruple GEM

system is changing from high to low values. For example in Fig. 15 for 70:30

Ar/CO2 gas ratio with ∆V=320 V, the ion backﬂow fraction decreases with

increasing induction ﬁeld Ei for ﬁxed drift ﬁeld Ed. The minimum ion backﬂow

fraction value is calculated and it is found to 3.5% with drift ﬁeld 0.1kV in

Ar/CO2 in 70:30 gas mixture. In this case, it is observed that the more the

gain, the less the ion backﬂow fraction. Similarly, in Figs. 16 and 17, the ion

backﬂow fraction are 3.0% and 3.8% with drift ﬁeld 0.1kV in Ar/CO2 mixed

gas mixture 80:20 with ∆V= 300 V and 90:10 with ∆V =270 V, respectively.

However, for Fig. 15, the ion backﬂow fraction changes rapidly due to a change

of eﬀective gain as a function of Ei. For example, the ion backﬂow value becomes

almost half at ﬁxed Ed=0.1 kV/cm from Ei =3 to 5 kV/cm, due to eﬀective

gain changes from 3000 to 11000. The higher the eﬀective gain value the smaller

the ion backﬂow fraction. Similar trends are also seen in Ref.[2, 16, 17, 18].

4. Conclusion

The performance in the GEM mainly depends on ﬁeld conﬁgurations and

gas mixtures. So a detailed measurement is done for the study of ion back-

ﬂow fraction with GEM-based detectors. The eﬀective gain and ion backﬂow

fraction are determined for a single and quadruple GEM detector. Throughout

the experiment, the ambient parameters like gas ﬂow rate, temperature, pres-

sure, and relative humidity are maintained constant. The dependencies of ion

backﬂow fraction are carefully observed with Ed, Ei, ∆V, and with three mixed

Ar/CO2 gas 70:30, 80:20 and 90:10 ratios. It is found that the ion backﬂow frac-

tion is dependent on the conﬁguration of the drift ﬁeld and the GEM voltage

∆V. The ion backﬂow fraction values decrease as a function of the induction

ﬁeld keeping drift ﬁeld as constant. With an increase in gain, the ion backﬂow

fraction decreases proportionately. From the scanning over gas ratios, we also

observed that with increasing quencher proportion, the Eﬀective Gain decreases

and ion backﬂow fraction value is quite high. We found a minimum ion back-

ﬂow fraction of 3.5%, 3.0% and 3.8% with Ed = 0.1 kV/cm for 70:30, 80:20

and 90:10 Ar/CO2 gas ratios, respectively, for quadrupole GEM detector and a

minimum ion backﬂow fraction of 18 % is achieved in the single GEM detector

with Ar/CO2 80:20 gas mixture.

The Eﬀective Gain of the quadruple GEM is measured by estimating the

currents from the pulse height spectrum using MCA and found to be similar to

that estimated by the current measurement method.
