Abstract. The NEWS-G direct dark matter search experiment uses spherical proportional
counters (SPC) with light noble gases to explore low WIMP masses. The ﬁrst results obtained
with an SPC prototype operated with Ne gas at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM)
have already set competitive results for low-mass WIMPs. The forthcoming next phase of
the experiment consists of a large 140 cm diameter SPC installed at SNOLAB with a new
sensor design, with improved detector performance and data quality. Before its installation at
SNOLAB, the detector was commissioned with pure methane gas at the LSM, with a temporary
water shield, oﬀering a hydrogen-rich target and reduced backgrounds. After giving an overview
of the improvements of the detector, preliminary results of this campaign will be discussed,
including UV laser and Ar-37 calibration data.

1. Introduction
Astronomical and cosmological observations provide strong evidence that most of the matter
in the Universe is in the form of cold, non-baryonic dark matter [1, 2]. The best-motivated
candidate is a stable, massive, neutral particle generically referred to as a WIMP (Weakly
Interacting Massive Particle) [3]. Direct detection experiments typically look for nuclear recoil
signatures in the range of (1–100) keV coming from the elastic scattering of WIMPs oﬀ a target
nucleus with masses of (10–1000) GeV/c2. In the last decade, new theoretical motivation for
low mass WIMPs searches (GeV/c2 range) has increased interest in the community, but it
requires sub-keV recoil energy thresholds and detector materials containing low mass nuclei.
New Experiments With Spheres-Gas (NEWS-G) is a dark matter direct-detection experiment
using spherical proportional counters [4] (SPCs) with light noble gases and has been designed
to be speciﬁcally sensitive to detect very low WIMP masses down to 0.1 GeV/c2. The ﬁrst
results in 2017 from the NEWS-G collaboration, obtained with a 60-cm diameter prototype
SPC, SEDINE, operated in a compact radiation shielding with a Ne + CH4 (0.7%) at 3.1
bars for a total exposure of 9.7 kg-days at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM) [5]
set new constraints on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section for WIMP
masses under 0.6 GeV/c2 [6]. The 42.7 day-long physics run taken between in 2015 conﬁrmed the
relevance of SPCs for dark matter searches and placed NEWS-G as a leader in the search for low-
mass WIMPs. The current phase of the experiment consists of a larger sphere of 140 cm diameter
SPC to be operated at SNOLAB [7]. However, a ﬁrst campaign has been performed with pure
methane gas at the LSM, a temporary water shield, and improvements in the reduction of the
background levels. The use of a lighter target, improved threshold, and detector performance
will allow for unprecedented sensitivity to sub-GeV WIMPs down to 0.1 GeV/c2.

 
 
 
 
 
 
2. NEWS-G Detector
The NEWS-G collaboration has built a 140-cm diameter sphere made with ultra-low background
copper (C10100) and radio-pure material shielding to minimize backgrounds that come from
radioactive impurities within detector construction materials. The SPC is placed in a concentric
25 cm low-radioactivity lead shield, with the innermost 3 cm of lead made from ultra-low
210Pb content archaeological lead and surrounded by 40 cm of high-density polyethylene to
shield against neutrons from the environment. The inter-space is continuously ﬂushed with pure
nitrogen to mitigate the presence of radon. The detector schematic is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Schematic of the
140 cm diameter detector
and shielding setup.

The two C10100 hemispheres were fabricated in France. An electroplating method developed
at PNNL (USA) was implemented to add 0.5 mm of pure copper to the inside of the hemispheres,
to limit the impact of the 210Pb contamination found in the C10100 copper used to fabricate the
SPC [8]. This work was performed underground at LSM to limit the production of cosmogenic
radioactive backgrounds. The hemispheres were then welded into a sphere using an electron
beam in France. After cleaning and etching the sphere underground at LSM, the sphere was
kept isolated from the naturally present radon in a sealed, nitrogen-ﬁlled bag. Additional eﬀorts
have been made to improve the gas handling system and gas quality, including a series of ﬁlters
to remove electro-negative impurities such as water and oxygen and radon. A radon trap system
[9] has been developed at the University of Alberta, and adsorbent materials and their optimal
temperature conditions are explored for the forthcoming phase at SNOLAB. In addition, a
novel sensor called ACHINOS with eleven individual anodes has been developed by NEWS-G
collaborators to improve charge collection in large detectors by increasing the magnitude of the
electric ﬁeld at large radii [10]. The sensor was read out in two channels, the lower (“southern”)
6 anodes and upper (“northern”) 5 anodes. The complete installation of the 140 cm SPC
with the lead shielding was achieved at LSM with a temporary neutron shield to allow the full
commissioning of the detector using pure methane in low background conditions before being
dismounted and shipped to SNOLAB. As with previous NEWS-G experiments, the current
induced on the anode by the movement of avalanche ions is integrated and ampliﬁed with a
CREMAT charge sensitive pre-ampliﬁer [11], then digitized [6].

3. Commissioning at the LSM
A limited physics campaign at the LSM lasting approximately 6 days was carried out with
the 140 cm SPC. Pure methane gas was used as a target material (135 mbar), which oﬀers
the advantage of a larger fraction of hydrogen target material, with lower backgrounds from
Compton scattering. Only data collected from the southern channel of the ACHINOS sensor is
used to produce physics results, as the electric ﬁeld and detector response are uniform in this
region of the sphere, which spans roughly 70% of the volume of the detector.

traces deconvolved for the pre-ampliﬁer and ion-induced current responses [12]; an example
of this is shown in Fig. 2. To take advantage of this additional information, a peak-ﬁnding
algorithm based on ROOT TSpectrum class is applied to the data [13]. This allows for the
rejection of background signals, many of which are single-peak events. A large portion of low
energy background events observed are after-pulse signals induced by alpha decays (primarily
210Po on the surface of the sphere), which produce signiﬁcant increases in the rate of single-
peak events, as well as a distortion in the electric ﬁeld due to the ∼ 108 charges produced in
the alpha particle’s Townsend avalanche, observable as a decrease in electron drift time. This
background is mitigated by removing 5 s after observed alpha decays, leading to a roughly 13%
loss of exposure. Another phenomenon unique to this experimental setup was the “cross-talk”
observed between the two channels of the ACHINOS sensor. Physical pulses producing a current
on one channel were found to induce a smaller, inverted signal on the other with a consistent
fractional amplitude of approximately 20% (see Fig. 2). However, non-physical pulses (that do
not produce an avalanche in the gas) do not follow this trend, which is exploited as a means of
discrimination against non-physical background events.

During this campaign, calibration data was collected with a 213 nm pulsed UV laser system
[14], using a photo-diode to tag these events, in which primary electrons are extracted from the
surface of the sphere via the photoelectric eﬀect. The laser was continuously run at a pulse
rate of 10 Hz to monitor changes in detector operating conditions, including a roughly 10%
drop in detector gain over the course of the campaign due to increasing gas contamination.
Between daily physics runs, dedicated laser calibrations with low-intensity laser pulses occurred,
producing on average approximately 5 primary electrons. These electrons then drift to the
southern hemisphere of the ACHINOS sensor, providing tagged, low-energy calibration events
to characterize the SPCs avalanche response. The resulting amplitude spectrum, shown in Fig.
3 for one calibration run, allows for characterization of the SPCs single electron response. This
is modeled with the Polya distribution [15, 16] (a modiﬁed exponential) with shape parameter θ
(θ = 0 is an exponential distribution, but approaches a Gaussian for large θ) [14]. Additionally,
the mean gain (cid:104)G(cid:105) of the detector can be extracted from this calibration. The peak ﬁnding
algorithm is also characterized with the laser calibration data by including contributions of false
negative, false positive, and coincident peaks in the amplitude spectrum of identiﬁed single
electron events. The peak-ﬁnding algorithm identiﬁes 64% of primary electrons, with a 0.1%
chance of falsely identifying noise as peaks in a span of 60 µs. Comparing the amplitude spectrum

risetime.

Another component of the calibration program is the use of 37Ar, a radioactive gas producing
two low-energy electron capture decays of 270 eV and 2.8 keV [17]. This allows for conﬁrmation
of the linearity of the detector energy response over this energy regime, and modelling of
the detector response in energy and risetime (a PSD variable proportional to radii). To ﬁt
this data, the detector’s energy response was modeled using the COM-Poisson distribution
for primary ionization [18], and the Polya distribution for avalanche ionization [14]. Electro-
negative contaminants in the gas (such as O2 and H2O) preferentially reduce the amplitude of
events originating farther from the sensor (at higher risetimes), which is modeled using binomial
statistics for the number of un-trapped primary electrons, with the survival probability varying
linearly with risetime. The relative rates of 2.8 keV and 270 eV decays were determined using a
Geant4 simulation [19, 20]. Additionally, some 2.8 keV decays produce 2.6 keV x-rays which can
escape the sphere, leaving 200 eV to be deposited by electrons. The laser calibrations provide
a constraint on the gain of the southern-most anode (where laser events are collected), and the
gain of the other 5 southern hemisphere anodes was allowed to vary. The resulting ﬁt is shown
in Fig. 4. This yields estimates for many detector-response parameters, including the W-value
and Fano factor at several diﬀerent interaction energies, and the gain of the entire southern
channel of the ACHINOS sensor.

4. Future Steps at SNOLAB and Conclusions
The 140 cm SPC has since been relocated to SNOLAB, with installation complete as of
September 2021. After initial commissioning, physics data will be taken with a neon-methane
gas mixture, yielding sensitivity down to WIMP masses of 0.1 GeV/c2. As was the case at the
LSM, UV laser and 37Ar calibration will be used to characterize the detector’s energy response at
the single electron level. The projected exclusion curve for spin-independent interactions for this

experiment is shown in Fig. 5. In summary, NEWS-G has successfully operated a new 140 cm
SPC at the LSM with methane gas. Dark matter results are expected from this campaign soon.
With the demonstrated capability to observe single ionization quanta, NEWS-G is expected to
prove highly sensitive to nuclear recoils from low mass dark matter, both with existing data in
methane gas and upcoming work at SNOLAB.

1.67 ± 0.5 d.r.u., and a quenching
