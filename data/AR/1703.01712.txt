Interaction of Two Active Region Filaments Observed by NVST
and SDO

ABSTRACT

Using high spatial and temporal resolution Hα data from the New Vacuum
Solar Telescope (NVST) and simultaneous observations from the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO), we present a rare event on the interaction between two
ﬁlaments (F1 and F2) in AR 11967 on 2014 January 31. The adjacent two
ﬁlaments were almost perpendicular to each other. Their interaction was driven
by the movement of F1 and started when the two ﬁlaments collided with each
other. During the interaction, the threads of F1 continuously slipped from the
northeast to the southwest, accompanied by the brightenings at the junction of
two ﬁlaments and the northeast footpoint of F2. Part of F1 and the main body of
F2 became invisible in Hα wavelength due to the heating and the motion of F2.
At the same time, bright material initiated from the junction of two ﬁlaments
were observed to move along F1. The magnetic connectivities of F1 were found
to be changed after their interaction. These observations suggest that magnetic
reconnection was involved in the interaction of two ﬁlaments and resulted in the
eruption of one ﬁlament.

Introduction

Filaments are relatively cool and dense plasma suspended in the hot corona. They are
usually observed to form and be maintained in a magnetic channel (Martin 1998). Recent
observations show that the material of ﬁlaments are supported by magnetic ﬂux ropes,

which can be visible when ﬁlaments are activated or erupted (Cheng et al. 2011; Li & Zhang
2013a,b,c; Yang et al. 2014; Yan et al. 2015). Filaments are known to have magnetic patterns
of handness or chirality (Martin 1998). Viewing the ﬁlament from the positive-polarity side,
the chirality is deﬁned to be dextral if the ﬁlament axial ﬁeld is directed rightward and
sinistral if directed leftward. Generally, ﬁlaments follow a handedness rule, in which dextral
ﬁlaments dominate in the north hemisphere and sinistral ﬁlaments dominate in the south
one (Martin et al. 1994). It is believed that the ﬁlament chirality and the magnetic helicity
sign have a one-to-one correspondence, in which dextral ﬁlaments have negative (left-handed)
magnetic helicities and sinistral ﬁlaments have positive (right-handed) helicities (Chae 2000).

Previous observations reveal that two nearby ﬁlaments can approach and interact with
each other (e.g., D’Azambuja & D’Azambuja 1948; Kong et al. 2013; Li & Ding 2012; Xue et al.
2016a). Some authors have presented observations that ﬁlaments of the same chirality, shar-
ing a common ﬁlament channel, could merge into a single ﬁlament at their neighboring ends
(Deng et al. 2000; Schmieder et al. 2004; Bone et al. 2009; Joshi et al. 2014; Zhu et al. 2015).
While Su et al. (2007) showed that two sinistral ﬁlaments along diﬀerent channels could
merge by body coalescence and form a common ﬁlament channel. More recently, Jiang et al.
(2014) reported that the intrusion of the erupted material of one sinistral ﬁlament into the
ﬁlament channel of the other sinistral ﬁlament caused the merge of the two ﬁlaments. Un-
like the above observations, Kumar et al. (2010) and Chandra et al. (2011) found that two
dextral ﬁlaments observed on 2003 November 20 ﬁrst approached each other, then merged
at their middle parts, and ﬁnally separated in opposite directions. Consequently, the two
ﬁlaments changed their footpoint connections to form two newly linked ﬁlaments. Similar
observations were also reported by Jiang et al. (2013).

Under convective zone conditions, Linton et al. (2001) simulated the collision of two
highly twisted, identical ﬂux ropes. In their numerical simulation, four types of interaction
were found on the basis of the helical sign and contact angle of the two ﬂux ropes. They
were bounce, merge, slingshot, and tunnel, in which the magnetic reconnection was involved.
The interaction was called bounce when the two collided ﬂux tube bounced oﬀ each other,
and was called merge when they merged into one. The slingshot interaction occurred when
the two ﬂux ropes with opposite helicities collided with each other in an appropriate contact
angle. As a result, two new ﬂux ropes with exchanging footpoint connections formed and
then slingshotted away from the interaction region. In the following work of Linton (2006),
the collision of two lowly twisted and unequal ﬂux ropes with the same helicity can also
produce the slingshot interaction. Under coronal conditions, T¨or¨ok et al. (2011) also found
the slingshot interaction of two ﬂux ropes with the same helicity, which was based on the
event that occurred on the 2003 November 20. Note that the opposite and same helicities
mentioned above refer to the sign of helicity. The tunnel and slingshot interaction had the

– 3 –

same initial condition. Nevertheless, the slingshot reconnected once at the collision site and
ﬁnally formed two new ﬂux tubes. The tunnel reconnected twice at two diﬀerent places and
exchanged the section between the two reconnection points, making the ﬂux tubes to pass
through each other. Among them, the slingshot interaction was the most energetic because
In addition, DeVore et al. (2005)
the magnetic ﬂux was annihilates and twist canceled.
performed numerical simulations of the formation and interaction between pairs of head-to-
tail ﬁlaments within the sheared-arcade model. Four possible basic combinations of chiralities
(identical or opposite) and axial magnetic ﬁelds (aligned or opposed) between the ﬁlaments
have been considered. The numerical experiments suggest that tether-cutting reconnection
occurred between ﬁlaments with aligned axial ﬁelds, irrespective of their chiralities.

There exists mainly two mechanisms that lead to the instability of ﬁlaments and trigger
the energy release and eruptions. One is the non-ideal process such as magnetic recon-
nection (Lin & Forbes 2000; Antiochos et al. 1999; Moore et al. 2001; DeVore & Antiochos
2008; Shen et al. 2012; Li et al. 2016; Xue et al. 2016b), and the other is an ideal magne-
tohydrodynamic (MHD) process such as kink and torus instabilities (T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005;
Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Srivastava et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2014; Bi et al. 2015). Observations
have indicated that magnetic reconnection during the ﬁlament interaction can lead to ﬁla-
ment eruptions. Kim et al. (2001) observed a ﬁlament that partially erupted after a rapid
change of connectivity in a bundle of ﬁlament threads. Su et al. (2007) pointed out that
one ﬁlament eruption resulted from the sudden mass injections produced by external bodily
magnetic reconnection between two ﬁlaments. More recently, Chen et al. (2016) reported
that tether-cutting reconnections between ﬁlaments triggered ﬁlament eruptions.

To our knowledge, observational evidences on ﬁlament interaction are relatively rare
and need to be further studied, which is helpful to understand physical mechanisms of such
interaction. In this paper, we present detailed analysis of the interaction of two ﬁlaments with
the high-resolution, multi-wavelength observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope
(NVST; Liu et al. 2014) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012).
We describe the observational data in Section 2 and present analysis results in Section 3.
Conclusions and discussions were given in Section 4.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

The NVST has a multi-channel high resolution imaging system, which is used to observe
the ﬁne structures in the photosphere and the chromosphere. Up to now, it can image the
Sun in three channels, i.e., TiO, G-band, and Hα. The Hα channel is centered at 6562.8 ˚A,
with a bandwidth of 0.25 ˚A. It can provide oﬀ-band observation in the range of ±5 ˚A with

– 4 –

a step size of 0.1 ˚A. In the present work, the Hα line center images from 06:55:00 UT
to 07:59:59 UT on 2014 January 31 were employed to analyze the interaction of the two
ﬁlaments in the chromosphere. These images have a pixel size of 0.162′′ and a cadence of
12 s. The ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) is 150′′×150′′. The Hα data are ﬁrst processed by dark current
subtracted and ﬂat ﬁeld corrected, and then are reconstructed by speckle masking (Weigelt
1977; Lohmann et al. 1983).

The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2011) on board SDO provides
full-disk images taken in seven EUV passbands and three continuum bands. The spatial
resolution and cadence of these images are 1.5 ′′ and 12 s, respectively. Here, all of the seven
EUV channels were used, which cover a temperature range from 0.05 MK to 20 MK. The
diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) using the almost simultaneous observations of six AIA
EUV lines (131 ˚A, 94 ˚A, 335 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 193 ˚A, and 171 ˚A formed at coronal temperature)
was reconstructed, and the DEM-weighted average temperature was calculated (Cheng et al.
2012). We also used the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) (Scherrer et al. 2012)
line-of-sight magnetograms and vector magnetic ﬁeld data from the SDO. The line-of-sight
magnetograms were used to extrapolate the potential ﬁelds above the photosphere, which
were used to calculate the decay index of magnetic ﬁelds overlying on the F2. They have
a cadence of 45 s and a sampling of 0.5 ′′ pixel−1. The vector magnetic ﬁeld data were
obtained by using the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector algorithm (Borrero et al.
2011). The 180 azimuthal ambiguity was resolved based on the minimum energy method
(Metcalf 1994; Metcalf et al. 2006; Leka et al. 2009). These data have a pixel size of 0.5
′′ pixel−1 and a cadence of 12 minutes. We processed the AIA images and HMI line-of-
sight magnetograms by using the standard routine aia prep.pro in the SolarSoftWare (SSW)
packages (Freeland & Handy 1998), and rotated all the images to a reference time (07:30 UT
on 2014 January 31). In addition, the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) full-disk
Hα image was used to align the SDO and NVST data.

3. Results

On 2014 January 31, the observations of the NVST covered the interaction process
of two ﬁlaments (“F1” and “F2”), which were located close together in a complex NOAA
AR 11967 (S14E41). Figure 1 shows their locations outlined by the blue dashed lines in
the SDO/AIA 304 ˚A and Hα images with the SDO/HMI radial component of the vector
magnetic ﬁeld superimposed before F1 began to move. The black and white contours indicate
the negative and positive magnetic ﬁeld. The level of the contours is ±100 G. It is clear
that F1 is roughly oriented along the east-west direction, while F2 oriented along the north-

– 5 –

south direction. The axes of the two ﬁlaments were nearly perpendicular to each other (see
Figures 1(a) and (b)). When viewed at the positive-polarity side, the axial ﬁeld direction of
F2 was leftward. Therefore, F2 is a sinistral ﬁlament, which is consistent with the preferential
ﬁlament pattern in the southern hemisphere (Martin et al. 1994). It can be seen from Figure
1(b), F1 was not strictly located on the polarity inversion line (PIL), but its location was
close to the PIL. It is supposed that F1 might be suspended high in the corona, and the
misalignment between F1 and the PIL was due to the projection eﬀect.

Figure 2 displays the interaction of the two ﬁlaments and the subsequent ﬁlament erup-
tions in Hα, 304 ˚A and 335 ˚A wavelengths, respectively. Prior to the interaction, the two
ﬁlaments can be identiﬁed as dark structures not only in the cool channels such as Hα and
AIA 304 ˚A channels, but also in the hot channels such as AIA 335 ˚A channel (see Figures
2(a) – (a2)). At about 06:55 UT, the central part of F1 was activated and began to move
to the southwest direction (see Animation 1). As a result, F1 gradually approached F2
from the northeast to the southwest direction (see Figures 2(b) – (b2)). Such approaching
motion can be clearly seen in the stack plots along the slit “A – B” , in which the two
ﬁlaments can be identiﬁed as dark tracks (see Figures 5(b) – (d)). At about 07:22 UT, F1
impinged on the northeast part of F2 and the brightenings appeared at the junction of the
two ﬁlaments. The brightenings were enhanced with further ﬁlament interaction, which were
marked by the white arrows in Figures 2(c) – (c2). Simultaneously with the appearance of
the brightenings, the cool plasma of ﬁlament was heated up and started to move along F1.
The moving heated plasma was observed as bright structures in Figures 2(c1), (c2), (d1),
and (d2), which were marked by the thin white arrows. It was exhibited as many bright
stripes in the stack plots along the slit “C – D” (see Figure 5(e)). At the same time, part
of F1 and the main body of F2 became invisible in the Hα wavelength (see Figure 2(c)),
while they exhibited as obvious brightenings at 304 ˚A wavelength (see Figure 2(c1)). The
disappearance of F1 might be mainly due to the heating of the ﬁlament plasma, but that of
F2 might have two probabilities. one is the heating of the ﬁlament plasma, and the other
is the motion of F2. Unfortunately, NVST has no oﬀ-band observations on that day. At
about 07:25 UT, F2 started to erupt. Meanwhile, it underwent an anticlockwise rotation
during its eruption. Three minutes later, F2 collided with its overlying large-scale loops and
began to interact with them, as shown in Figure 3. These large-scale loops were brightened
by the interaction and can be clearly seen in Figure 3(b). As the interaction was processed,
the overlying large-scale loops were continually stretched and the material of F2 was found
to be falling down along them (see Figure 3(c) and Animation 2). The interaction led to
the deﬂection of F2. F2 ﬁnally developed to a fan structure (as marked by the thick white
arrows in Figures 2(d) – (d2)). At about 07:28 UT, two ﬂare ribbons appeared on opposite
sides of the eruptive F2 (marked as “FR” in Figures 2(d) – (d2)). It was too weak to be

– 6 –

recorded as a ﬂare, similar to observations shown by Yang et al. (2008). Several minutes
later, another pair of ﬂare ribbons appeared at the east of F1 in the same active region. It
was related to a GOES C2.3 ﬂare, which started at 07:35 UT and peaked at 07:57 UT. No
coronal mass ejection was associated with this eruption.

In order to present the ﬁlament interaction in more detail, we extracted the interaction
region (as marked by the white square in Figure 2(b)) and analyzed its evolution process
at Hα and 304 ˚A wavelengths, as showed in Figures 4(a) – (l). The southwest border of
F1 was traced out by red dashed curves in Figures 4(a) – (g). Owing to the high spatial
resolution of the NVST, the ﬁlament threads can be clearly distinguished (see Figures 4(a)
– (h)). It is noticed that the F1’s threads extended to the east before its interaction with
the threads of F2, as shown in Figure 4(a). At about 07:22 UT, the southwest bunch of F1’s
threads collided with the northeast bunch of F2’s threads. It seems that the two bunches
of threads joined together (see Animation 3). One minute later, they began to separate
and F1’s threads continued to move to the southwest direction (see red dashed lines in
Figures 4(b) – (h)). Note that the bunch of F1’s threads that was involved in the ﬁlament
interaction changed their directions, and curved to the southwest direction, indicating that
the magnetic connectivities of F1’s threads have changed. As the interaction continued,
the magnetic connectivities of F1’s threads changed continuously, exhibiting as a slipping
motion from the northeast to the southwest direction (see Animation 3). The F1’s threads
ﬁnally rooted in the weak network region, where the northwest footpoint of F2 was originally
located (see Figure 4(h)). The newly formed magnetic structure was depicted by the yellow
dashed line in Figure 4(h). We also noticed that the brightenings appeared at the northwest
footpoint of F2 when the two ﬁlaments collided with each other (see Animation 3). Following
the movement of F1’s threads, the brightenings were gradually strengthened and extended
to the northwest direction, which also showed up as a slipping motion (see thick red arrows
in Figures 4(b) – (g) ). Such kind of brightenings was ever observed by Kim et al. (2001)
in a pre-eruption reconnection event, and was considered to be caused by the downward
draining ﬁlament material produced by the magnetic reconnection. And more notably, the
brightenings appeared at 304 ˚A wavelength when the F1’s threads collided with the F2’s
threads, as shown by the yellow arrow in Figure 4(j). They were enhanced as the interaction
in progress, and can be clearly identiﬁed in chromospheric and coronal lines (see Figures
4(k), (m) – (o) and Animation 3). The temperature map obtained with the DEM method
was shown in Figure 4(p), and it is found that the temperature of the brightenings can reach
up to 20 MK. These observations suggest that magnetic reconnection might occur between
F1 and F2 during the interaction process. The brightenings at the northwest footpoint
of F2 indicate that magnetic reconnection during the ﬁlament interaction altered the stable
environment of F2. We speculate that the downward magnetic tension force might decreased

– 7 –

when magnetic reconnection occurred, which might trigger the eruption of F2.

To investigate the brightenings at the junction of the two interactive ﬁlaments, we
selected a small region marked by the white box in Figure 4(j) to calculate the variation of
Hα, SDO/AIA 304 ˚A and 335 ˚A brightness over time, as shown in Figure 5(a). We note
that these curves started to increase at about 07:22 UT (marked by the yellow vertical line),
which was the time when the two ﬁlaments encountered each other. For tracing the eruption
of F1 before interaction, we made time slices from Hα, 304 ˚A, and 335 ˚A images along a slit
“A – B” (marked by a white line in Figure 2(a)). As seen from the Figures 5(b) – (d), the
ﬁlaments appeared as dark tracks. Clearly, F1 was slowly approaching F2 at a speed of 3 –
5 km s−1. During this process, F2 almost did not move. In order to trace the mass motions
along F1, we made a time slice from AIA 304 ˚A images along a slit “C – D” (marked by a
white line in Figure 2(b1)). It is noted that these mass motions started at about 07:22 UT,
and had a velocity of 150 km s−1.

In order to better understand the eruption of F2 in this event, the magnetic topol-
ogy and the decay index over the ﬁlament were obtained by performing the local potential
ﬁeld extrapolation (Alissandrakis 1981; Gary 1989). The decay index is deﬁned as n=-
dln(B)/dln(h), where B is the transverse strength of the magnetic ﬁeld and h is the height
measured from the photosphere. Here decay indexes were derived from a central cross section
of F2 (marked by the red line in Figure 6(a)) at a height range from 0.9 Mm to 22 Mm.
The results were shown in Figure 6(b). Here, the height of F2 was estimated. We assumed
that F2 has a loop shape vertical to the solar surface and its footpoints rooted in the same
atmospheric level. The line of sight has a 37◦ angle relative to the solar surface. So the
maximum height of F2 is estimated to be about 12.9 Mm, which was marked by the blue
dashed line in Figure 6(b). The red line in Figure 6(b) denotes where the cross section cut of
F2. As seen from Figure 6(a), one can see that F2 was restricted by the overlying large-scale
arcades (marked by the golden ﬁeld lines in Figure 6(a)). From Figure 6(b), we note that
F2 was located on the intersection point of the red solid line and the blue dashed line, and
the decay index above F2 was lower than 0.3, which was far below the theoretical threshold
value (1.5) of torus instability (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006). Therefore, torus instability is not the
mechanism of F2’s eruption. However, F2 erupted during the ﬁlament interaction, which
suggests that F2’s eruption was mainly caused by the ﬁlament interaction.

4. Conclusions and Discussion

The interaction of two adjacent ﬁlaments (F1 and F2) was well observed by the NVST
and SDO at the southeast of the Sun on 2014 January 31. F1 and F2 were close and almost

– 8 –

perpendicular to each other. The interaction was driven by the movement of F1, which had
a velocity of 3 – 5 km s−1. The interaction occurred when F1 and F2 collided with each
other and produced brightenings at the junction of these two ﬁlaments. The threads of F1
continuously slipped from the northeast to the southwest, accompanied by the brightenings
at the northwest footpoint of F2. Moreover, the motions of bright material can be seen
along F1 from the junction of the two ﬁlaments. The temperature of the brightenings at the
junction of the two ﬁlaments was up to 20 MK. During the interaction, part of F1 and the
main body of F2 became invisible in Hα wavelength but appeared as evident brightenings
in the 304 ˚A wavelength, which might be due to the heating and the motion of F2. The
interaction led to the change of the magnetic connectivities of F1’s threads. Finally, F2
erupted after their interaction.

The interaction was driven by the F1’s movement. Previous observations show that
there are two kind of mechanisms driving the ﬁlament interaction. One is slow photospheric
motions (Kumar et al. 2010; Chandra et al. 2011; T¨or¨ok et al. 2011) and the other is the
eruption of one of the interactive ﬁlaments (Jiang et al. 2013, 2014; Kong et al. 2013). It is
obvious that the ﬁlament interaction in this event was driven by the second mechanism.

Magnetic reconnection normally occurred during the ﬁlament interaction. Based on the
observations of the converging motions of the two ﬁlaments, the subsequent appearance of a
hot plasma layer, and a coronal hard X-ray source near the interaction interface, Zhu et al.
(2015) pointed out that the two ﬁlaments reconnected with each other during their inter-
action. In this event, evidences of magnetic reconnection in the ﬁlament interaction region
were also presented, including high-temperature brightenings (up to 20 MK) at the junction
of the interactive ﬁlaments, mass motions along F1, signiﬁcant plasma heating, the magnetic
connectivity change of F1, and brightenings at the northwest footpoint of F2. During the
ﬁlament interaction, the connectivities of F1’s threads changed continuously, accompanied
by the slipping motion of the brightenings at the northeast footpoint of F2. To our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst time to display the details of ﬁlament interaction process, especially
the magnetic connectivity change of ﬁlament threads, which was owing to the high temporal
and spatial resolution of the NVST.

In this event, no clear observational signatures for bounce, merge or tunnel were found.
However, it is noted that F1’s magnetic connectivities changed after the interaction, indi-
cating that at least one new ﬁlament formed. Therefore, the interaction of this event might
be inclined to support the slingshot interaction. This event was associated with a GOES
C2.3 ﬂare. Since the eastern leg of F1 was rooted in between the two ﬂare ribbons and the
interaction changed the magnetic connectivities of F1 and F2, this ﬂare might be resulted
from the eruption of F2.

– 9 –

During the ﬁlament interaction, F2 became unstable and erupted. Previous observa-
tions show that magnetic reconnection during ﬁlament interaction can initiate solar erup-
tions. Su et al. (2007) present observations that the overloaded mass ejection caused by
the magnetic reconnection during the ﬁlament interaction led to the second ﬁlament erup-
tion. Bone et al. (2009) pointed out that the build-up shear of long linking ﬂux tubes by
magnetic reconnection involved in the ﬁlament interaction , together with the removal of
overlying ﬁeld by magnetic ﬂux reconnection, led to the instability and eventual eruption of
the interactive ﬁlaments. Very recently, Chen et al. (2016) claimed that the tether-cutting
reconnection between two ﬁlaments triggered solar eruptions. In this case, it is also magnetic
reconnection involved in the ﬁlament interaction that might trigger F2’s eruption. According
to the result of torus instability, F2 should be stable before the ﬁlament interaction. It was
balanced under the upward magnetic pressure force, downward magnetic tension force, and
downward gravity force. The downward magnetic tension force might be decreased when
magnetic reconnection occurred between the two ﬁlaments, which breaks the balance of F2’s
strapping ﬁeld, and leads to the ﬁnal eruption of F2.

Fig. 1.— SDO/AIA 304 ˚A (a) and NVST Hα (b) images overplotted by the contours of the
SDO/HMI radial component of the vector magnetic ﬁeld showing the locations of the active
region ﬁlaments. “F1” and “F2” represent the two interactive ﬁlaments. The two ﬁlaments
are delineated by the blue dashed lines. Black/white contours represent positive/negative
polarity regions, and the contour level is ±100 gauss. The ﬁeld of view (FOV) of panel (b)
is outlined by the green square in panel (a).

Fig. 2.— NVST Hα (a – d), SDO/AIA 304 ˚A (a1 – d1), and 335 ˚A (a2 – d2) images showing
the interaction of the two ﬁlaments and subsequent ﬁlament eruptions. The line “A” – “B”
marks the slit position of space-time plots of panels (b) – (d) in Figure 5. The curve line
“C” – “D” marks the slit position of the space-time plot of panel (e) in Figure 5. “FR”
represents the ﬂare ribbons involved in this event. The white square in panel (b) gives the
FOV of Figure 4. The thick white arrows in panels (c) – (c2) point to the erupting F2. The
thin white arrows in panels (c1), (c2), (d1), and (d2) point to the mass motions. The thick
white arrows in panels (d) – (d2) indicate the fan structure of F2 after its eruption.
