ABSTRACT

Obtaining observational evidence of the turbulent component of solar dynamo operating
in the convective zone is a challenging problem because the dynamo action is hidden below
the photosphere. Here we present results of a statistical study of ﬂaring active regions (ARs)
that produced strong solar ﬂares of an X-ray class X1.0 and higher during a time period that
covered solar cycles 23 and 24. We introduced a magneto-morphological classiﬁcation (MMC)
of ARs, which allowed us to estimate possible contribution of the turbulent component of the
dynamo into the structure of an AR. We found that in 72% of cases, ﬂaring ARs do not comply
with the empirical laws of the global dynamo (frequently they are not bipolar ARs, or, if they
are, they violate either Hale polarity law, or the Joy’s law, or the leading sunspot prevalence
rule), which may be attributed to the inﬂuence of the turbulent dynamo action inside the
convective zone on spatial scales of typical ARs. Thus it appears that the ﬂaring is governed
by the turbulent component of solar dynamo. A contribution into the ﬂaring from these ARs-
“violators” is enhanced during the second maximum and the descending phase of a solar cycle,
when the toroidal ﬁeld weakens and the inﬂuence of the turbulent component becomes more
pronounced. These observational ﬁndings are in consensus with a concept of the essential
role of non-linearities and turbulent intermittency in the magnetic ﬁelds generation inside the
convective zone, which follows from simulations of dynamo.

1 INTRODUCTION

Improved astrophysical observational and computational capabili-
ties presented new evidence that magnetic ﬁelds are the key force
that supports the endless chain of cosmological non-stationary phe-
nomena. In space, the magnetic ﬁeld generates energy from stars
and galaxies. This small amount of energy under the inﬂuence of
the weak seed magnetic ﬁeld and turbulent motions in the medium
is spent on generation of new magnetic ﬂux, the so called dynamo
process. Release of this magnetic energy fuels the relentless activity
of solar-type stars - spots and eruptions (ﬂares on the Sun).

Studies of the solar dynamo and investigations in the ﬁeld of
solar ﬂare forecast usually do not overlap. Theoretical research and
numerical simulations of the dynamo (e.g., Karak & Miesch 2017;
Pipin 2018; Cameron et al. 2018), see also reviews by Charbonneau
(2010, 2014, 2020); Brun et al. (2015), do not consider prob-
lems of solar ﬂares. In turn, recent progress in ﬂare forecast-
ing (e.g., Barnes et al. 2016; Leka et al. 2019; Cinto et al. 2020;
Nishizuka et al. 2020) is often based on photospheric magnetic ﬁeld
properties of active regions with statistical and machine learning
techniques and does not involve processes of magnetic ﬂux gen-

eration. Here we will explore solar activity via studying dynamo-
processes and we will show that the non-linear (turbulent) com-
ponent of the dynamo, namely, ﬂuctuations of dynamo on a broad
range of spatial scales, is connected to variations of ﬂaring activ-
ity and they (ﬂuctuations) can be revealed from observations. It is
widely accepted that for the majority of solar active regions (ARs)
the magnetic ﬁeld is generated by the mean-ﬁeld dynamo (global dy-
namo), see, e.g., a review by van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green (2015).
According to Abramenko, Zhukova, & Kutsenko (2018), the mag-
netic structure of about 70% of the investigated 1494 ARs is con-
sistent with the essential empirical laws that follow from the mean-
ﬁeld dynamo theory: bipolar ARs obeying the Hale polarity law,
the Joy’s law and the rule of a prevalence of the leading spot in
a bipolar structure. Nevertheless, a question how to explain ap-
pearance of those 30% of ARs that violate the aforementioned
laws is still open. It is highly unlikely that these ARs are simply
due to large ﬂuctuations in an Gaussian medium since a fraction
of such ﬂuctuations should not exceed 5%. One possibility is to
consider them as a result of strong ﬂuctuations in an intermit-
tent medium, in other words, in a non-linear dynamical dissipa-
tive system (NLDDS). In such a system, strong ﬂuctuations are
not rare and they appear in both space and time domains. In this
case, there is a basis to speculate that strong ﬂares are intrinsi-

cally related to strong spatial ﬂuctuations, i.e, ARs that violate
the mean-ﬁeld theory rules mentioned above. It is well established
that ARs with a complex magnetic structure display enhanced ﬂare
activity (e.g., Ireland et al. 2008; Falconer, Moore, & Gary 2008;
McAteer, Gallagher, & Conlon 2010). However, there also are al-
ternative opinions on this subject (e.g., Georgoulis 2012). The ma-
jority of publications are focused on revealing of critical conditions
for ﬂares to occur, and on ﬁnding a set of parameters, which is sen-
sitive to the pre-ﬂare energy build-up. Our approach is diﬀerent. We
consider strong ﬂares as unavoidable strong ﬂuctuations in the time
domain. For an NLDDS, the presence of strong temporal ﬂuctua-
tions implies the existance of strong deviations in the spatial domain
as well. In our case, strong spatial ﬂuctuations are the “violator” ARs
with deviations from the regular magnetic conﬁguration. If the solar
dynamo performs as a NLDDS, then occurrence of strong ﬂares and
the appearance of AR-“violators” (irregular ARs) have to be statis-
tically related. We intend to check this hypothesis. To do this, we
investigated all 79 ARs of 23rd and 24th solar cycles that produced
at least one X-class ﬂare during its passage across the solar disk. For
each AR we determined their magneto-morphological class (MMC)
by using the criteria outlined below, and compared these with the
ﬂaring index of the AR. A time distribution of the ARs through the
cycles was also analyzed to reveal the signature of the dynamo wave
performance.

2 MAGNETO-MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION

OF ACTIVE REGIONS

According to the mean-ﬁeld dynamo theory, ﬂux tubes of the
toroidal ﬁeld rise from the bottom of the convection zone toward
the photosphere and then form bipolar magnetic regions (sunspot
groups, or ARs) as that ﬂux pushes further into the solar atmosphere.
For the majority of cases, the sunspot groups obey certain empirical
laws (van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015). Thus, polarities of the
leading (western) sunspot are opposite in the Northern and South-
ern hemispheres, and the polarity sign changes from one cycle to
another cycle, a behaviour known as Hale’s polarity law (Hale et al.
1919; Hale & Nicholson 1925). Bipolar ARs tend to emerge with
a systematic tilt of their axis relative to the solar equator, so that
the leading sunspot is located closer to the equator. The tilt tends to
increase with the latitude and this pattern is known as Joy’s law. The
twist of an emerging ﬂux tube is determined by Coriolis force and is
thought to be a plausible reason for the tilt (Wang & Sheeley 1991;
D’Silva & Choudhuri 1993), however other reasons are possible
(Leighton 1969; McClintock & Norton 2013). The third empirical
law is the prevalence of the leading sunspot in the bipolar structure:
in majority of cases, the area of the leading spot is larger than the
area of the largest sunspot in the following part of an AR. This im-
plies that the leading spot is more coherent and the magnetic ﬁelds
are less inclined than those in the following part. Note that Babcock
(1961) considered this observational property of bipolar ARs as one
of the keystones of Babcock-Leighton phenomenological concept
of the solar dynamo, that later became the origin of the mean-ﬁeld
dynamo theory.

However, as it was mentioned in Introduction, about one third
of ARs do not follow these laws (Abramenko, Zhukova, & Kutsenko
2018). The tilt of a bipolar structure may not follow Joy’s law (the
most common violation, 20% of all ARs), the leading spot may
be smaller than the largest following spot (about 12% of the total
number), or the polarities of leading and following spots may be
reversed (anti-Hale ARs, they constitute about 3-4% of all ARs).

All these deviations may be explained by peculiarities in the ﬂow
ﬁeld of the convection zone that twist and stretch a toroidal ﬂux
rope while it rises toward the photosphere, in other words, by the
mild inﬂuence of the turbulent dynamo.

The inﬂuence of turbulent dynamo on the toroidal ﬂux ropes
can be stronger. For example, it can result in fragmentation of a
ﬂux rope with subsequent deformation of the fragments that may
lead to formation of several co-aligned bipoles on the solar surface
with prevailing E-W orientation, similar to the well known AR
NOAA 11158. Moreover, distortions of the toroidal ﬂux rope may
become so signiﬁcant that the resulting AR may appear as a complex
conﬁguration of mixed polarity sunspots distributed chaotically.

In our original magneto-morphological classiﬁcation (MMC,
Abramenko, Zhukova, & Kutsenko 2018), we divided all ARs into
three classes: class A, which includes bipolar ARs that follow all
aforementioned laws, is referred to as regular ARs; class U con-
sists of unipolar sunspots without opposite polarity pores in the
trailing part, and class B that includes the rest of ARs - irregular
ARs. Some of irregular ARs have a bipole structure and violate
at least one of the laws. However, a part of them do not display a
classical bipole structure; instead they show multipolar or strong
𝛿-structures. The multipolar and strong 𝛿-structures were very rare
when we studied ARs of any ﬂaring capability, but they became not
rare at all when we explored here the strong-ﬂaring ARs. Strictly
speaking, the three aforementioned laws are not applicable for ARs
without classical bipolar structure. This motivated us to introduce
here further speciﬁcations inside classes.

Considering that

this study is to estimate
the degree of
the turbulent dynamo on the
AR formation process, we modiﬁed here our classiﬁcation
(Abramenko, Zhukova, & Kutsenko 2018) by introducing sub-
classes into the A and B classes:

A1 - bipolar ARs for which Hale polarity law and Joy’s law are
fulﬁlled, the leading spot is dominant, and there were no small 𝛿-
structures inside the AR during its passage across the solar disk
(see Figure 1). These type of ARs may be considered as a result of
non-disturbed emergence of a single toroidal ﬂux tube.
A2 - bipolar ARs for which Hale polarity law, the Joy’s law are
fulﬁlled, the leading spot dominates and there were small (relative to
the size of the leading spot) 𝛿-structure(s) during the passage across
the solar disk (see Figure 2). These type of ARs may result from a
small contribution of the turbulent dynamo, possibly operating at
the near-surface depth.
B1 - bipolar ARs which violate at least one of the aforementioned
law (can be considered as a result of mild distortion of a single
toroidal ﬂux tube), with small (if any) 𝛿-structure(s) during the
passage across the solar disk. A typical example is shown in Figure
3.
B2 - multipolar ARs consisting of several quasi-coaligned bipoles
having general axis orientation in accordance to Joy’s law. Fre-
quently these ARs contain a strong 𝛿-structure and they can be
represented by AR NOAA 11158 (Figure 4). Class B2 ARs may
be regarded as resulting of fragmentation and distortion of a sin-
gle toroidal ﬂux tube. For that reason we included into the B2 class
strong single 𝛿-structures (see Figure 15a in Toriumi & Wang 2019)
as also consisting of one ﬂux tube.
B3 - multipolar ARs where opposite polarity sunspots are dis-
tributed in an irregular manner so that it is impossible to deﬁne the
AR axis and assign leading and trailing sunspots (Figure 5). These
ARs represent the most complex magnetic structures and can be
considered as a result of interaction (intertwining) of several ﬂux

tubes in the convective zone. Often such magnetic knots appear in
the vicinity of a unipolar sunspot (e.g., AR NOAA 12673) resulting
from fast ﬂux emergence. It is likely that such a bundle of inter-
wound ﬂux tubes may have been channelled to the surface along the
pre-existing structures of deeply rooted stable sunspots. The exis-
tence of such a channel in the vicinity of a vortex structure (recall
that 𝐵 = 𝑟𝑜𝑡 ( 𝐴)) is a frequent occurrence in an intermittent medium
(Frisch 1995).

Table 1 summarizes the essential criteria of the magneto-
morphological classiﬁcation. In parentheses, our comments in the
framework of turbulent dynamo inﬂuence are presented.

We note that some ARs evolved very fast during their passage
across the solar disk, so that it was diﬃcult to assign a perma-
nent MMC class for the entire time interval. In such cases, we
assigned the class as determined during a 2-3 day interval prior to
the strongest ﬂare. For ARs with the strongest ﬂare occurred in the
eastern limb, the class was acquired when the AR was on the lon-
gitude around -(50-70) degrees (e.g., NOAA ARs 12339, 10930).

As for bipolar ARs, in the present study, we utilized an ex-
perience obtained in Abramenko, Zhukova, & Kutsenko (2018) for
reliable estimations of the AR’s tilt (Joy’s law) and the leading spot
dominance. Problems that arise in detection of ARs with reverse
polarity (violation of the Hale polarity law) are discussed in details
in Zhukova et al. (2020) and taken into account here. As for multi-
polar ARs, there could be some issues to which class (B2 or B3) a
given AR should be assigned. For example, in NOAA AR 12297 the
dominating feature is the strong 𝛿-structure, and the ARs could be
classiﬁed as B2. However, a moderate bipole nearby the 𝛿-structure
emerging during the day of the strongest ﬂare is in favour to classify
this AR as B3 - a multipolar caused by at least two ﬂux tubes.

Our list includes 79 ARs that produced X-class ﬂares during
the time interval from January 1996 to December 2018 spanning
solar cycles 23 and 24 (Tables 2, 3). Only for 9 ARs (out of 79)
no 𝛿-structure were observed and documented during all days of
observations (see the last column in tables). This allowed us to
conclude that the presence of a 𝛿-structure within an AR appears to
be a common condition for X-class ﬂare to occur.

In this context, it is interesting to compare our classiﬁcation
with the classiﬁcations of 𝛿-structures by Zirin & Liggett (1987)
and by Toriumi & Wang (2019). Two opposite polarity umbras em-
bedded in a common penumbra belong to type 1 according to
Zirin & Liggett (1987) and comprises a“spot-spot” type accord-
ing to Toriumi & Wang (2019), while in our MMC classiﬁcation
this structure belongs to class B2. A multi-polar complex of tightly
packed sunspots within an extended penumbra (“island 𝛿-spots”) be-
longs to type 1 𝛿-structures per Zirin & Liggett (1987) and B3 class
in the MMC classiﬁcation. ARs of type 2 (Zirin & Liggett 1987)
and “spot-satellite” ARs (Toriumi & Wang 2019), in cases when
the satellite-sunspot is smaller than the leading spot, belong to the
class of the hosting bipole. Type 3 ARs (Zirin & Liggett 1987) and
“quadrupole” groups (Toriumi & Wang 2019) overlap with class B2
in MMC classiﬁcation. “Inter-AR” groups (Toriumi & Wang 2019)
are very rare and belong to our B3-class (AR NOAA 08647, marked
with a star in Table 2).

We did not utilize the existing classiﬁcations such as Zurich
classiﬁcation (or McIntosh Sunspot Group Classiﬁcation McIntosh
(1990)), Hale classiﬁcation (Mount Wilson classiﬁcation Hale et al.
(1919)) for the following reasons. Both these classiﬁcations uni-
formly treat all bipolar ARs, which is not acceptable when one aims
to diagnose turbulent dynamo in the convection zone. The advantage
of the proposed classiﬁcation is that 1) those bipoles violating the

empirical laws of the global dynamo are separated into one special
class, and 2) the classiﬁcation scheme is organized in such a way
that the expected contribution from the turbulent dynamo increases
through the classes from A1 toward B3.

3 DISTRIBUTION OF STRONG-FLARING ARS OVER
THE MAGNETO-MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSES

Second and third columns in Tables 2 and 3 list the ﬁrst and the last
day of AR’s presence on the solar disk, while the fourth column
lists the strongest X-class ﬂare in an AR (GOES class, date and UT
time). The 5th column shows the corresponding Flare Index (FI,
Abramenko 2005), which was derived by summing the GOES-class
of all ﬂares observed in an AR during its passage across the solar
disk, 𝜏, and then normalizing the total by 𝜏. Further scaling was
applied so that an AR with one C1.0 (X1.0) ﬂare per day has the
ﬂare index FI=1.0 (100). The 6th column lists the AR compliance
with the empirical laws of the global dynamo for the bipolar ARs.
In the headline, the "H" stands for the Hale polarity law, the "J"
stands for the Joy’s and the "L" for the dominance of the lead-
ing spot rule. Below, in lines, the "Y" stands for "Yes" - adhering
to the law, and the "N" stands for "No" - violation of the law.
Multipolar ARs are marked with the "M"-symbol and ARs with a
strong dominating 𝛿-structure are marked with the symbol "𝛿". The
magneto-morphological class is shown in the 7th column. And the
last column shows the Hale class1 of an AR determined prior to the
ﬂare. As we mentioned above, the majority of ARs (70 out of 79)
possessed a 𝛿-structure.

The MMC-class distribution of the analyzed ARs is shown
in Figure 6. The majority of the X-class ﬂare ARs (72%) are of
B-class. Also, the AR capability to produce intense ﬂares tends to
increase with the MMC-class changing from A1 to B3, i.e., with an
enhanced complexity caused by increasing contribution/inﬂuence
of the turbulent component of the dynamo. (The only deviation is a
transition from A2 to B1: the A2-ARs are more numerous than the
B1-ARs. Apparently a presence of even small 𝛿-structure is more
important for strong ﬂaring than the overall rotation or inclination
of the ﬂux tube.) In general, ARs of class A display rather low ﬂare
activity, with the most regular ones (A1-class) being the least active
and they are small in numbers. ARs with even small 𝛿-structure
present (class A2) are more prone to strong ﬂaring, they are more
numerous and display higher ﬂare index as compared to the A1-
class ARs. Similar dynamics is seen within the B-class ARs; the
strongest ﬂares occur in ARs of class B2 and B3, i.e., those ARs
that are most aﬀected by the turbulent dynamo.

We would like to emphasize that B-class ARs consti-
tute about 25-30% of all ARs regardless their ﬂaring activity
(Abramenko, Zhukova, & Kutsenko 2018), whereas their fraction
increases up to 72% when we consider only those ARs with strong
ﬂares (>X1.0). This suggests that the occurrence of the most power-
ful ﬂares is associated with those magnetic conﬁgurations for which
turbulent dynamo in the convective zone contributed substantially
into the generation of their ﬂux. And the larger the contribution of
the turbulent dynamo action, the stronger the ﬂaring potential of the
resulting magnetic structure.

4 DISTRIBUTION OF STRONG-FLARING ARS ALONG

A CYCLE

The cycle dependence in the appearance of ﬂare-productive ARs is
shown in Figures 7 and 8 where the AR ﬂare index is plotted against
the AR observation time. We also plot time variations of sunspot
area using Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) and US Air Force,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (USAF NOAA)
sunspot data2 smoothed with a 13-month averaging window. Reg-
ular A-class ARs are shown with black circles, and the B-class
AR are shown with red circles. B-class ARs are more numerous
and they appear throughout the entire cycle. The A-class ARs are
mostly concentrated at the rising phase and the ﬁrst maximum of
each solar circle. There are no A-class ARs with the ﬂare index
above ≈100 level, so that data for irregular ARs only appear above
this level.

To make this tendency more prominent, we calculated a yearly
cumulative ﬂare index as a sum of ﬂare indices of all ARs of a
given class (Figure 8). Flare-productive A-class ARs, which we
hypothesize is a product of the global dynamo, tend to appear and
contribute into the ﬂaring at the rising phase and during the ﬁrst
maximum of a cycle, when the global toroidal ﬁeld is expected to
be strong. However, during the second maximum and the declining
phase of a solar cycle, when the toroidal ﬁeld weakens (Charbonneau
2020), the irregular ARs become the main producers of powerful
episodes of solar activity.

5 CONCLUDING REMARKS

We introduced a magneto-morphological classiﬁcation (MMC) of
ARs in order to better describe possible contribution of turbulent
dynamo into the formation of ARs. Comparing the MMC class of
active region and their ﬂare productivity over solar cycles 23 and
24 allowed us to conclude the following.
1) Out of all ARs that produced X-class ﬂares, 72% are the ARs-
“violators”, i.e., non-compliant with (at least one of) the empirical
laws of the global dynamo (Hale polarity law, Joy’s law, and the
leading spot prevalence rule), while these ARs constitute only 25-
30% of all observed 1494 ARs (Abramenko, Zhukova, & Kutsenko
2018). Thus, the strongest ﬂuctuations in the time domain (ﬂares)

are statistically related to the strongest distortions in the space do-
main, which is one of the key properties of a non-linear dynamical
dissipative system. The inference is in a favour of a viewpoint that
the solar dynamo is one of such systems.

2) The time distribution of ﬂaring ARs over a solar cycle indicates
that the regular A-class ARs contribute to solar activity mostly
during the rising phase of a cycle and its ﬁrst maximum, whereas
irregular B-class ARs are more distributed in the decline phase and
they are dominating source of solar ﬂares during the second maxi-
mum and the declining phase. The rising phase of the dynamo wave
is when the toroidal component of the magnetic ﬁeld is strongest
so that we observe both regular and irregular ﬂaring ARs. As the
dynamo wave proceeds, the toroidal component weakens and the
turbulent component of the dynamo becomes more pronounced thus
notably distorting emerging toroidal ﬂux tubes and leading to ap-
pearance of strong ﬂuctuations in the spatial domain (i.e., irregular
ARs).

Our analysis showed that the majority of ARs that produced X-
class ﬂares do not follow the laws of the global mean-ﬁeld dynamo
and possess an irregular magnetic structure. Therefore, large tem-
poral and spatial ﬂuctuations in the solar dynamo are not rare and
indicate on the existence of the turbulent component of the dynamo
on scales of ARs. Thus the gap between the large-scale dynamo
that generates the global poloidal and toroidal ﬁelds and the small-
scale turbulent dynamo that is responsible for quiet sun magnetic
ﬁelds may be ﬁlled by the turbulent dynamo acting on mid-scales
throughout the convective zone. Then one might expect a contin-
uous spectrum of turbulent magnetic ﬁelds and energy on a large
range of spatial scales. The presumed continuous spectrum is a nat-
ural property of a turbulent medium (Monin & Yaglom 1975). Note
that existence of a continuous temporal spectrum of solar activity
was recently demonstrated by Frick et al. (2020) based on time vari-
ations of the total sunspot area. The continuous spectrum implies
that magnetic energy is generated not only on the largest scales,
but also on a wide range of intermediate scales of the turbulent
intermittent convective zone. The entire process works as a whole
with a continuous energy exchange between the scales. The con-
cept was suggested in early theoretical studies by Kazantsev (1968)
and Zel’dovich & Ruzmajkin (1987). More recently the existence
of the turbulent component of dynamo follows from theoretical
considerations and numerical simulations in both time variations
(Sokoloﬀ et al. 2010; Olemskoy & Kitchatinov 2013; Passos et al.
2014; Karak & Miesch 2017; Schüssler & Cameron 2018) and spa-

MNRAS 000, 1–5 (2015)

tial properties (Nelson et al. 2013) of solar activity. However, ob-
servational evidence of the continuous spectrum, especially in the
spatial domain, is not strong so far mainly because the dynamo ac-
tion is hidden below the photosphere. Publications in this ﬁeld are
rather scanty (Sokoloﬀ, Khlystova, & Abramenko 2015).

In conclusion, it is worth to mention that the explored here four
essential properties which characterise the regular ARs (bipolarity
and three empirical laws) do not cover the entire list of such proper-
ties. For example, the hemispheric sign preference rule of helicity
complies for the majority of ARs (Pevtsov et al. 2014, and refer-
ences herein). This parameter undoubtedly deserves an extended
analysis in future. Note that LaBonte, Georgoulis, & Rust (2007)
investigates ARs of the 23rd solar cycle and found that for X-ﬂaring
ARs, the hemispheric sign preference rule tends to be obscured due
to intrinsic helicity injection of opposite sign. A recent study by
Park, Leka, & Kusano (2021) of the hemispheric sign preference
rule for ARs of the 24th solar cycle demonstrated that in helio-
graphic areas where the ARs with strong ﬂares occurred, the degree
of compliance of this rule is lowered. They argued that below the
photosphere there should be localized volumes of enhanced turbu-
lence, where vigorous turbulent plasma motions aﬀect the shape
and future ﬂare capability of some ﬂux tubes while they are rising
to the surface. This inference is in agreement with the suggested
above concept on the role of the turbulent component of dynamo in
the AR formation and ﬂaring.

Figure 1. A typical example of an active region of A1-class: a bipolar AR of the 23rd cycle is located in the Northern hemisphere and has the
positive polarity of the leading spot (compliance of the Hale polarity law); the AR obeys the Joy’s law; the leading spot dominates any of the
following spots. No small 𝛿-structure is observed. The magnetogram (top) and the continuum image (bottom) are acquired by SOHO/MDI
instrument in the high-resolution mode (Scherrer et al. 1995). North to the top, west to the right. Direction of the equator coincides with the
horizontal side of the frame. The magnetogram is scaled from -800 G (black) to 800 G (white).

Figure 2. A typical example of an active region of A2-class: a bipolar AR of the 24rd cycle is located in the Northern hemisphere and has
the negative polarity of the leading spot (compliance of the Hale polarity law); the AR obeys the Joy’s law; the leading spot dominates the
following spot. A small 𝛿-structure is observed in the middle. The line-of-sight magnetogram (hmi.sharp-720s series) and the continuum image
are acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO, Schou et al. (2012)). North to the
top, west to the right. Direction of the equator coincides with the horizontal side of the frame. The magnetogram is scaled from -500 G (black)
to 500 G (white).

Figure 3. A typical example of an active region of B1-class: a bipolar AR of the 24rd cycle is located in the Southern hemisphere and has the
positive polarity of the leading spot (compliance of the Hale polarity law); the AR does not obey the Joy’s law: the leading part is located
farther from the equator than the following part; the rule of the prevalence of the lading spot is not met: the leading spot is smaller than the
following spot. Notations are the same as in Figure 2.

Figure 4. An example of an active region of B2-class: a complex AR composed from two co-aligned bipoles emerged simultaneously with the
general orientation in accordance with the Joy’s law that allows to suppose a common toroidal ﬂux tube (fragmented or bended, see Figure
6 in Toriumi et al. (2017).) The Hale polarity law and the Joy’s law are met for both bipoles, however the leading spot prevalence rule is not
applicable. Notations are the same as in Figure 2.

Figure 5. An example of an active region of B3-class: a complex AR composed from several chaotically distributed spots of both polarities.
The empirical global dynamo laws are not applicable. A complex knot of ﬂux tubes in the convective zone, similar to that in Figure 4 by
Ishii, Kurokawa, & Takeuchi (1998), might be the source. Notations are the same as in Figure 2.

𝑎 - for bipolar ARs: "H" stands for the Hale polarity law, the "J" for the Joy’s law, the "L" for the leader prevalence rule.
Below, in lines, for bipolar ARs: the "Y" stands for "Yes" - adhering to the law, and the "N" stands for "No" - violation of the law.
★ - "M" marks multipolar ARs, " 𝛿" marks ARs with tight strong dominating 𝛿-structure.
∗ - the strongest ﬂare occurred between two ARs.

Figure 6. Distribution of 79 ARs with strong ﬂares (>X1.0) over the magneto-morphological classes from A1 to B3. Each AR is marked by a
circle (black for regular ARs of A-classes and red for irregular ARs of B-classes). The vertical axis shows the ﬂare index, FI, of each AR. For
each class, numbers denote the number of cases. Strongest ﬂares occur (FI>100) only in ARs of classes B2 and B3.

Figure 7. Time distribution of active regions with strong ﬂares (>X1.0) along the two solar cycles. For each AR, the ﬂare index FI is shown along
the vertical axis. Regular (irregular) ARs are marked with black (red) circles. The green line shows the total sunspot area smoothed over 13
months; RGO and USAF/NOAA data available at http://solarcyclescience.com/activeregions.html were used. Strongest ﬂares occur (FI>100)
only during the second maximum and descending phase of a cycle.

Figure 8. Cumulative over a year ﬂare index of regular (black) and irregular (red) ARs during the two cycles. Regular ARs (a product of the
global dynamo) tend to contribute into strong ﬂare production on the rising phase and during the ﬁrst maximum of the cycle, whereas irregular
ARs produce strong ﬂares through the entire cycle and considerably enhance their activity during the second maximum and descending phase.
Notations are the same as in Figure 7.
