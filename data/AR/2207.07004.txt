Abstract
We analyze 152 large conﬁned ﬂares (GOES class  M1.0 and  45° from disk center) during 2010−2019, and
classify them into two types according to the criterion taken from the work of Li et al. “Type I” ﬂares are
characterized by slipping motions of ﬂare loops and ribbons and a stable ﬁlament underlying the ﬂare loops. “Type
II” ﬂares are associated with the failed eruptions of the ﬁlaments, which can be explained by the classical 2D ﬂare
model. A total of 59 ﬂares are “Type I” ﬂares (about 40%) and 93 events are “Type II” ﬂares (about 60%). There
are signiﬁcant differences in distributions of the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux (ΦAR) of active regions (ARs)
producing the two types of conﬁned ﬂares, with “Type I” conﬁned ﬂares from ARs with a larger ΦAR than “Type
II.” We calculate the mean shear angle ΨHFED within the core of an AR prior to the ﬂare onset, and ﬁnd that it is
slightly smaller for “Type I” ﬂares than that for “Type II” events. The relative nonpotentiality parameter
ΨHFED/ΦAR has the best performance in distinguishing the two types of ﬂares. About 73% of “Type I” conﬁned

ﬂares have ΨHFED/ΦAR<1.0 × 10
ΨHFED/ΦAR  1.0 × 10−21 degree Mx−1. We suggest that “Type I” conﬁned ﬂares cannot be explained by the
standard ﬂare model in 2D/3D, and the occurrence of multiple slipping magnetic reconnections within the
complex magnetic systems probably leads to the observed ﬂare.

1. Introduction
Solar ﬂares are one of the most energetic events in solar
activity and as early as 1859, the observation of the solar ﬂare
was ﬁrst recorded. For most large solar ﬂares, they are usually
associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Solar ﬂares
and their associated CMEs are widely recognized as two
performance forms of the same underlying physical process,
and the ﬂares associated with CMEs are named eruptive ﬂares
(Svestka & Cliver 1992). There are also some ﬂares that are not
associated with any CME, and these types of ﬂares are called
conﬁned ﬂares. It was revealed that ﬂare–CME association rate
increases with the ﬂare intensity and decreases with the
increasing total unsigned magnetic ﬂux (ΦAR) of active regions
(ARs) producing the ﬂares (Yashiro et al. 2006; Li et al.
2020, 2021a).

Solar ﬂares and CMEs are considered to originate from the
rapid release of
free magnetic energy through magnetic
reconnection (Forbes 2000; Shibata & Magara 2011). Since
the concept and preliminary theory of magnetic reconnection
were put forward, Kopp & Pneuman (1976) proposed a model
to elaborate the ﬂare based mainly on the studies of Carmichael
(1964), Sturrock (1966), and Hirayama (1974), which is called
the CSHKP model. Before the ﬂare onset, a magnetic ﬂux rope
(ﬁlament) located near the magnetic polarity inversion line
(PIL) is bound by magnetic arcades across it. Due to the
occurrence of magnetic reconnection, in particular of the tether-
cutting type, the ﬂux rope becomes unstable and starts to rise

up. Then the magnetic reconnection occurs in the X-type
magnetic structure under the rising ﬂux rope and accelerates the
ﬂux rope. A series of extreme ultraviolet (EUV)/X-ray loops
are formed across the PIL, and their footpoints correspond to
Hα ribbons in the chromosphere.

Recent high-quality and rich observations showed that the
classical 2D CSHKP model remains insufﬁcient to explain
solar ﬂares. For
numerous observational phenomena of
instance, Li & Zhang (2014) found the apparent slipping
motions of the ﬂux rope’s end along the ﬂare ribbons. Dudík
et al. (2014) showed the apparent slipping motion of ﬂare loops
along the developing ﬂare ribbons during an eruptive X-class
ﬂare. Similar observations were also found in previous studies
(Sun 2013; Li et al. 2015; Li & Zhang 2015; Dudík et al. 2016;
Zemanová et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2019), which indicate that
the energy release in solar ﬂares is indeed an intrinsically 3D
phenomenon; 3D extensions to the CSHKP model have been
proposed to interpret the physical process of eruptive ﬂares
(Aulanier et al. 2012; Janvier et al. 2013), in which magnetic
reconnection occurs along quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs; Priest
& Démoulin 1995), and the continuous restructuring of ﬁeld
lines along the QSLs results in an apparent slipping motion of
ﬁeld line footpoints. Aulanier et al. (2006) simulated the
process of fast slippage of magnetic ﬁeld lines along QSLs in a
conﬁned ﬂare in the absence of a ﬂux rope. In recent years, the
close correspondence between ﬂare ribbons and the QSLs has
been shown in many studies (Masson et al. 2009; Savcheva
et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2016), which provides
strong evidence for QSL reconnection.

To reveal the key factors determining whether a ﬂare is
eruptive or not is an important question in ﬂare studies. The
constraining effect of the background magnetic ﬁeld overlying

the ﬂaring region is thought to be a key factor (Wang &
Zhang 2007; Yang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2017; Baumgartner
et al. 2018). Wang & Zhang (2007) found that conﬁned events
occur closer to the magnetic center of an AR and eruptive
events tend to occur close to the AR edge, implying that the
strong external ﬁeld overlying the AR core is probably the
main reason for the conﬁnement. Besides the conﬁnement of
overlying magnetic ﬁelds, the nonpotentiality of ARs produ-
cing the ﬂares is another aspect
to determine the eruptive
character of solar ﬂares (Nindos & Andrews 2004; Sun et al.
2015; Cui et al. 2018; Gupta et al. 2021; Kazachenko et al.
2022). The nonpotentiality of ARs reﬂects the degree that the
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld of an AR deviates from its
potential ﬁeld, which can be represented by many magnetic
parameters, such as magnetic helicity, magnetic twist, magnetic
energy, etc. Li et al.
two relative
nonpotentiality parameters α/ΦAR and Ψ/ΦAR within the AR
core (α is the mean characteristic twist parameter and Ψ is the
mean shear angle) for conﬁned ﬂares are signiﬁcantly smaller
than those for eruptive ﬂares.

The dynamic property of conﬁned ﬂares is important to
understand the conﬁning mechanism of solar ﬂares. It was
considered that conﬁned ﬂares are usually associated with
the failed eruption of the ﬁlament or ﬂux rope (Ji et al. 2003;

conﬁned by a strong strapping ﬁeld. Following the study of
Li et al. (2019), here we enlarge the ﬂare sample including

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2

and statistical results for the two types of conﬁned ﬂares,
respectively. Finally, we summarize our ﬁndings and discuss
their implications in Section 4.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

The data set analyzed in this study involves 152 M-class
conﬁned ﬂares4 during the period of 2010 June to 2019 June
(Li et al. 2020). For each event, we check the (E)UV
observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA;
Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) to make a classiﬁcation. In the
channels of AIA/304 and 171 Å, the dynamic evolution of the
ﬁlament during the ﬂare can be clearly discerned. From the
AIA/1600 and 131 Å observations, we can see if the slipping
motions of ﬂare ribbons and high-temperature loops occur
during the conﬁned ﬂare. Thus the four channels of AIA 1600,
304, 171, and 131 Å are mainly consulted in this work. We also
use the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld data from the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) on board the
SDO to compare the ribbon locations with the photospheric
magnetograms.

In order to calculate the nonpotentiality of ARs producing
the solar ﬂares, we also use the vector magnetograms from
Space-Weather HMI AR Patches (SHARP; Bobra et al. 2014)
of the SDO, which are remapped using a cylindrical equal
area projection with a pixel size of ∼0 5 and presented as
(Br, Bθ, Bf) in heliocentric spherical coordinates corresponding
to (Bz, −By, Bx) in heliographic coordinates (Sun et al. 2013).
Two nonpotential parameters are calculated for each event,

including the photospheric magnetic free energy density ρfree
and mean shear angle Ψ; ρfree describes the distribution of the
magnetic energy in excess of the minimum energy attributed to
the potential ﬁeld, which is calculated as

for the AR core region. Then we measure the mean shear angle
ΨHFED within the HFED region. Magnetic shear is deﬁned as

magnetic ﬁeld and a modeled potential magnetic ﬁeld based on

3. Results
For all the 152 conﬁned ﬂares, we divided them into two
types based on the following criterion, consistent with the
deﬁnition in Li et al. (2019).

During “Type I” conﬁned ﬂares, the slipping motions of
the ﬂare loops or ﬂare ribbons can be clearly seen. The

ﬁlament is stable and does not seem to be disturbed during
the ﬂare. In addition, the low-temperature PFLs observed in
the 171 and 304 Å channels are located above the stable
ﬁlament.

The main characteristic of “Type II” conﬁned ﬂares is the
failed eruption of the core ﬁlament. The ﬁlament initially rises
up during the ﬂare and then quickly slows down. The overlying
large-scale arcades are heated and can be observed at the high-
temperature wavelength (131 Å). In other words, “Type II”
ﬂares are consistent with the classical 2D ﬂare model.

Among the 152 conﬁned events, a total of 59 ﬂares are
“Type I” ﬂares (about 40%) and 93 events are “Type II” ﬂares
(about 60%). In order to show the dynamic property of the two
types of conﬁned ﬂares, two events from each type of conﬁned
ﬂares are selected as examples to analyze in detail. Based on
the vector magnetograms from the SDO/HMI, we calculate the
mean shear angle ΨHFED within HFED region for each event
prior to the ﬂare onset. Here we create a new data set,
ConﬁnedﬂareDB,5 and describe the classiﬁcation of the event
(“Type I” or “Type II”), the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux ΦAR
of ARs and the mean shear angle ΨHFED.

3.1. “Type I”: the M1.8-class Flare on 2014 December 1 and
the X1.6-class Flare on 2014 October 22
One selected event of “Type I” conﬁned ﬂares is the M1.8-
class ﬂare occurring in AR 12222 on 2014 December 1. The
GOES soft X-ray (SXR) 1−8 Å ﬂux showed that the M1.8-
class ﬂare started at 06:26 UT and peaked at 06:41 UT. From
the observations of 304 Å,
the short ﬁlaments are present
connecting the positive and negative-polarity magnetic ﬁelds
before the ﬂare onset (Figures 1(a) and (i)). After the ﬂare
started, the ﬁlaments did not show any rise phase and remained
stabilized (Figure 1(b)). At the decay phase of the ﬂare, low-
temperature PFLs were observed at 304 Å, which are located
above the noneruptive ﬁlaments (Figure 1(c)). In the 131 Å
channel, the ﬂare loops (FLs) were heated and illuminated
when the ﬂare started (Figures 1(d)–(f)). As the ﬂare evolved,
more loop bundles appeared and displayed apparent slipping
motions along ribbons (see Animation 1, Figure 1). Two
brightened ribbons can be clearly observed in the 1600 Å
images (Figures 1(g)–(h)), with one ribbon at the southeast of
the leading positive-polarity sunspot and the other one at the
southwest of the following negative-polarity sunspot. SDO/
HMI magnetograms show that the AR was gradually decaying
on 2014 December 1 (Figure 1(i)).

Figure 4. Similar to Figure 1, but for the M1.7-class ﬂare on 2011 August 3. The ﬁlament shows a failed eruption process. The animation of this ﬁgure includes
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 304 and 131 Å images from 04:20 UT to 04:48 UT.
(An animation of this ﬁgure is available.)

The apparent slipping motion of the ﬂare ribbons can be seen
in the 304 Å, which is displayed in Figure 2 to show the details
of the dynamic evolution of the ribbon substructures. In
Figure 2, we can see that the east ribbon was composed of
bright knots, which showed slipping motions clearly (see
Animation 2, Figure 2). We tracked and labeled three
individual bright knots within the ribbon as “1” to “3”. These
three bright knots move mainly in two directions. The bright
knot “1” slid westward along the straight-line part of the
ribbon. Bright knot “2” and bright knot “3” slid toward the
north of the ribbon. The bidirectional slipping motion of ribbon
substructures implies the occurrence of slipping magnetic
(Li &
reconnection between different magnetic systems
Zhang 2015; Dudík et al. 2016).

Another event we selected is the X1.6−class event in AR
12192 near the solar disk center (S14°, E13°) on 2014 October
22 as an example of “Type I” conﬁned ﬂares. The GOES SXR
1−8 Å ﬂux showed that the X1.6−class ﬂare started at 14:02
UT and peaked at 14:28 UT. The 304 Å observations showed
that the ﬁlament systems (Figure 3(a)) are present prior to the
onset of the ﬂare. There was no obvious rising stage for the
ﬁlaments, and during the ﬂare process, any failed eruptions are

not associated with them (Figure 3(b); see Animation 3,
Figure 3). At about 14:25 UT, the PFLs appeared at 304 Å
connecting two ﬂare ribbons (Figure 3(c)),
indicating the
cooling process of newly formed high-temperature loops
through magnetic reconnections. In the channel 131 Å, the
FLs displayed complex structures (Figures 3(d)–(f)), such as
the loops that are sheared with each other. With the ﬂare
evolution, the loop bundles were more abundant and exhibited
the slipping motions along ﬂare ribbons. The ﬂare is composed
of two ribbons as discerned in 1600 Å (Figures 3(g)–(h)), with
one short ribbon located nearby the sunspot and the other long
ribbon extended southward to the facula region (Figure 3(i)).

3.2. “Type II”: the M1.7-class Flare on 2011 August 3 and the
M7.6-class Flare on 2015 September 28
One selected “Type II” conﬁned ﬂare was generated in AR
11263 (N17°, E08°) on 2011 August 3. The ﬂare started at
04:29 UT and peaked at 04:32 UT from the GOES SXR 1−8 Å
ﬂux. It can be seen from the 304 Å images at 04:30 UT, the
shape of ﬁlament was like the letter of ε (Figures 4(a) and (d)).
Then the ﬁlament started to erupt and showed an expansion
process (Figure 4(b); see Animation 4, Figure 4). From about

Figure 5. Similar to Figure 1, but for the M7.6-class ﬂare on 2015 September 28. The ﬁlament shows a failed eruption process. The animation of this ﬁgure includes

(An animation of this ﬁgure is available.)

04:38 UT, the ﬁlament material gradually drained back along
its two legs to the solar surface and ﬁnally the brightening of
the material faded away (Figure 4(c)). From the 131 Å images,
it can be seen that large-scale EUV loops were present over the
ﬂaring region (Figure 4(e)). Associated with the eruption of the
ﬁlament,
these large-scale EUV loops were disturbed and
pushed outward. We suggest that the large-scale EUV loops
the ﬁlament, which
probably constrained the eruption of
resulted in the failed eruption of the ﬁlament. At the decay
phase of the ﬂare, brightened PFLs can be clearly observed in
the 131 Å channel (Figure 4(f)), indicative of the newly formed
loops through magnetic reconnection. In the early stage of the
ﬂare, two ribbons can be observed from the 1600 Å images
(Figure 4(g)). At 04:31 UT, the ribbons became longer and
more extensional (Figure 4(h)). It seems that the east ribbon
was anchored in the southeast of the following positive-polarity
the negative-
sunspot and the west ribbon was located at
polarity magnetic ﬁelds (Figure 4(i)).

Another selected “Type I” conﬁned ﬂare initiated at 14:53
UT and peaked at 14:58 UT in AR 12422 (S20°, W16°) on
2015 September 28 from the GOES SXR 1−8 Å ﬂux. At about
14:54 UT, the ﬁlament was illuminated and started to erupt

(Figures 5(a) and (d); see Animation 5, Figure 5). Meanwhile,
the high-temperature 131 Å images showed the presence of
large-scale EUV loops overlying the erupted ﬁlament. Then
more ﬁlament material and large-scale EUV loops were
illuminated (Figures 5(b) and (e)). At about 14:57 UT, most
ﬁlament material moved toward the east and then fell down to
the solar surface (Figure 5(c)). The ﬁlament underwent a failed
eruption with no material and magnetic structure going into the
interplanetary space. Associated with the failed eruption of the
ﬁlament,
the large-scale EUV loops displayed a gradual
expansion process, which ceased while reaching a certain
height (Figures 5(e)−(f)). In the 1600 Å, it can be observed that
there are two main ribbons at the northwest part of the ﬁlament
(Figures 5(g)–(h)), which are both located at the south of the
sunspot (Figure 5(i)).

“Type II” Conﬁned Flares

Figure 6 shows the maps of photospheric magnetic free
energy density ρfree and magnetic shear angle Ψ for the two
“Type I” and “Type II” events shown in Figures 1–5. It can be

distributions, with their large values around the PILs of ARs.
For the “Type I” M1.8-class ﬂare on 2014 December 1, the ρfree
and Ψ are both small (Figures 6(a)–(b)). The ribbon area (green
contours in panel (b)) does not correspond to the high Ψ region.
We also calculate the mean shear angle ΨHFED within the areas
of ρfree>4.0 × 104 erg cm−3 and it is only 24° for this event.
Compared with the ﬁrst event, the second “Type I” ﬂare has a
larger ρfree and Ψ (Figures 6(c)–(d)), with ΨHFED about 57°. For

the two “Type II” events, the values of ρfree and Ψ are evidently
higher than the two “Type I” ﬂares (Figures 6(e)–(h)). The
ΨHFED for the M1.7-class ﬂare on 2011 August 3 and M7.6-
class ﬂare on 2015 September 28° are 72° and 67°,
respectively. It can also be noticed that the ﬂare ribbons in
the two events overlay part of the high Ψ area. This implies that
the energy release of solar ﬂares occurs in the region with
strongly sheared magnetic ﬁelds.

We calculated the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux ΦAR and the
mean shear angle ΨHFED within the areas of high ρfree for 59
“Type I” and 93 “Type II” conﬁned ﬂares. The statistical
results are shown in Figure 7. As seen from the scatter plot of
the ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux FSXR versus ΦAR (Figure 7(a)), a
majority of conﬁned ﬂares (22 out of 26) belong to “Type I”
conﬁned ﬂares from ARs with a large ΦAR > 1.0 × 1023 Mx
(indicated by the vertical dashed line). The histograms for the
two types of conﬁned ﬂares show that there are signiﬁcant
differences in distributions of ΦAR between “Type I” and
“Type II” conﬁned ﬂares (Figure 7(b)). “Type I” events tend to
have a larger ΦAR than “Type II” ﬂares. The averages of the log
values of ΦAR (indicated by vertical dotted lines) are 8.8 × 1022
Mx and 5.1 × 1022 Mx for “Type I” and “Type II” conﬁned
ﬂares, respectively. The standard deviations of ΦAR for “Type
I” and “Type II” are 5.9 × 1022 Mx and 2.47 × 1022 Mx,
respectively. For the parameter ΨHFED, there is only a small
difference in distributions for the two types of conﬁned ﬂares
(Figures 7(c)–(d)). The average of the log values of ΨHFED is
59° for “Type I”, slightly smaller than that for “Type II”
conﬁned ﬂares (about 64°).
the relative
parameter ΨHFED/ΦAR, the differences between “Type I” and
“Type II” conﬁned ﬂares are more evident (Figure 7(e)). About
73% (43 of 59) of
conﬁned ﬂares have
“Type

93) of “Type II” conﬁned events have ΨHFED/ΦAR  1.0 ×

The averages of the log values of ΨHFED/ΦAR (indicated by

ﬂares show large deviations from normal distributions in ΦAR
and ΨHFED/ΦAR.

3.4. Flare Reconnection Flux and Flare Duration for “Type I”
and “Type II” Conﬁned Flares
We also analyze the reconnection ﬂux swept by ﬂare ribbons
ΦRIB (from a RibbonDB database in Kazachenko et al. 2017)
and the FWHM duration of the ﬂares τFWHM for the two types
of conﬁned ﬂares. It was shown that ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux FSXR
correlates with ﬂare reconnection ﬂux ΦRIB at a moderate rank
order correlation coefﬁcient rs of 0.42–0.43 for all the events:
“Type I” and “Type II” ﬂares (Figure 8(a)). Differently, the
ﬁtting slope α for “Type I” ﬂares is evidently higher than that
of “Type II” ﬂares. Similar to the parameter ΦAR, “Type I”’
conﬁned ﬂares have a larger reconnection ﬂux ΦRIB than “Type
II” events (Figure 8(b)). The averages of the log values of ΦRIB
(indicated by vertical dotted lines) are 5.3 × 1021 Mx and
3.5 × 1021 Mx for “Type I” and “Type II” cases, respectively.
The standard deviations of ΦRIB for “Type I” and “Type II” are
5.5 × 1021 Mx and 2.37 × 1021 Mx, respectively. For “Type I”
conﬁned ﬂares, the reconnection ﬂux ΦRIB and the FWHM
duration of the ﬂares τFWHM (Figure 8(c)) show a moderate
correlation with a rank order correlation coefﬁcient rs of 0.46.
However, there is no obvious positive correlation between the
two parameters for “Type II” ﬂares. Similarly,
there is a
signiﬁcant difference in distributions of τFWHM between the
two types of ﬂares (Figure 8(d)). The averages of the log values
of τFWHM are 920 s and 550 s for “Type I” and “Type II”
events, respectively.

4. Summary and Discussion
In this study, we analyzed 152 conﬁned ﬂares (GOES
class  M1.0 and  45° from disk center)
that occurred
between 2010 June until 2019 June, and classiﬁed them into
two types based on their different dynamic properties. “Type I”
ﬂares are characterized by slipping motions of ﬂare loops and
ribbons and a stable ﬁlament underlying the ﬂare loops. “Type
II” ﬂares are associated with the failed eruptions of the
ﬁlaments, which can be explained by the classical 2D ﬂare
model. A total of 59 ﬂares are “Type I” ﬂares (about 40%) and
93 events are “Type II” ﬂares (about 60%). There are
signiﬁcant differences in distributions of ΦAR between “Type
I” and “Type II” conﬁned ﬂares, with “Type I” conﬁned ﬂares
from ARs with a larger ΦAR than “Type II.” The nonpotenti-
ality parameter ΨHFED of “Type I” ﬂares is slightly smaller than
that of “Type II.” However,
the relative nonpotentiality
parameter ΨHFED/ΦAR has the best performance in distinguish-
ing the two types of ﬂares. About 73% (43 of 59) of “Type I”
conﬁned ﬂares have ΨHFED/ΦAR<1.0 × 10−21 degree Mx−1,
and ∼66% (61 of 93) of “Type II” conﬁned events have
ΨHFED/ΦAR  1.0 × 10−21 degree Mx−1. The ﬂare reconnec-
tion ﬂux ΦRIB and the FWHM duration of the ﬂares τFWHM
both give larger log-mean values for “Type I” than “Type II”
ﬂares.

For “Type I” conﬁned ﬂares, the slipping motions of ﬂare
loops and ribbon substructures are the signatures of slipping
reconnections along the QSLs (Aulanier et al. 2012; Janvier

et al. 2013). Flipping or slipping of magnetic ﬁelds was
predicted to be a property of all 3D reconnection models (Priest
& Forbes 1992; Li et al. 2021b), due to the continuous change
of ﬁeld line connections during their passage through a
diffusion region. The slipping motions of ﬂare loops and
ribbon substructures have been reported during eruptive ﬂares
(Li & Zhang 2015; Dudík et al. 2016), which can be interpreted
by the standard ﬂare model
in 3D (Janvier et al. 2015).
However, recent studies showed that the slipping motions can
also be observed during conﬁned ﬂares (Li et al. 2018, 2019).
They cannot be simply explained by the 3D standard ﬂare
picture, which requires the presence of an eruptive ﬂux rope.
Moreover, unlike what the standard ﬂare model in 2D/3D
predicts, the PFLs in “Type I” ﬂares are formed above the
stable ﬁlament, and the ﬂare does not involve the magnetic ﬁeld
of the ﬁlaments. The appearance of this type of conﬁned ﬂare is
similar to that of the named “atypical” ﬂares in several case
studies (Liu et al. 2014; Dalmasse et al. 2015; Joshi et al.
2019). The topological analysis shows that the occurrence of
multiple and sequential magnetic reconnections within the
complex set of QSLs led to the observed conﬁned ﬂare (Liu
et al. 2014; Dalmasse et al. 2015). Li et al. (2019) suggested
the magnetic conﬁguration of “Type I” ﬂares is very
that
complex with two or more QSLs overlying the core magnetic
structure, and multiple slipping reconnections along these
the ﬂare. Numerical
QSLs results in the occurrence of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling presents
that a

tether-cutting reconnection between the sheared magnetic
arcades leads to “Type I” ﬂares (Jiang et al. 2016).

“Type II” conﬁned ﬂares can be simply explained by the
standard ﬂare model in 2D. The ﬂare is caused by the failed
eruption of a ﬁlament, and a current sheet forms in the corona,
right below the erupting ﬁlament. The MHD simulation results
showed that the energy of the twist ﬂux rope is insufﬁcient to
break through the overlying ﬁeld, whose lines form a conﬁning
cage, but its twist is large enough to trigger a kink instability,
leading to the conﬁned ﬂare (Török & Kliem 2005; Amari et al.
2018). There is another possibility that the eruptive structure
ﬁrst enters the local torus-unstable region, and then keeps rising
and enters the torus-stable region when the decay index of
overlying magnetic ﬁelds presents a saddle-like proﬁle (Guo
et al. 2010; Baumgartner et al. 2018; Luo & Liu 2022). It was
suggested that the initiation and development of these types of
conﬁned ﬂares are similar to that of eruptive ﬂares, and the
main difference is the conﬁnement of the background ﬁeld
(Huang et al. 2020). The overlying large-scale coronal arcades
observed during the ﬂares probably correspond to the
restraining arcades above the ﬂaring region.

The measures of AR magnetic parameters show that the ARs
generating “Type I” ﬂares have a larger ΦAR, with the average
of the log values being 8.8 × 1022 Mx, much larger than that of
“Type II” ﬂares (5.1 × 1022 Mx). It has been revealed that ΦAR
describes the background ﬁeld conﬁnement overlying the
ﬂaring region, which is supported by the high positive
correlation between the critical decay index height and ΦAR
(Li et al. 2020, 2021a). The higher ΦAR of “Type I” ﬂares
indicates that the constraints of the overlying ﬁeld for “Type I”
ﬂares are much stronger than “Type II” ﬂares. The relative
nonpotentiality parameter ΨHFED/ΦAR can provide a good
ability for distinguishing the two types of conﬁned ﬂares. It
needs to be noted that the relative parameter does not seem to
be an entirely clear predictor of the type of ﬂares, considering
that there is a certain degree of overlap between the two types
of ﬂares. The relative parameter ΨHFED/ΦAR probably indicates
the balance between the upward force that drives the eruptions
and the downward force that suppresses the eruptions, which is
an important parameter in determining the capability of ARs to
produce eruptive ﬂares (Li et al. 2022). We suggest that for
“Type I” conﬁned ﬂares the overlying magnetic ﬁeld may be
too strong to allow the ﬁlament to erupt. The other reason
explaining the stable ﬁlament during “Type I” ﬂares is probably
the small twist values of the ﬁlament, impossible to trigger the
kink instability (Li et al. 2019). We also ﬁnd that “Type I” and
“Type II” conﬁned ﬂares signiﬁcantly differ regarding the
reconnection ﬂux ΦRIB and the ﬂare duration τFWHM, with
“Type I” cases having larger log-mean values. The moderate
correlation was obtained for ΦRIB versus τFWHM, consistent
with the results of Toriumi et al. (2017). Their relation implies
that the reconnection processes continue for longer when more
magnetic ﬂux is involved.

Our statistical study shows that the “Type I” conﬁned ﬂares
are numerous and occupy as high as 40% of all the large
conﬁned ﬂares, which is pointed out for the ﬁrst time to our
knowledge. “Type I”conﬁned ﬂares cannot be interpreted by
the standard ﬂare model in 2D and its extension in 3D. The true
distinction between “Type I” and “Type II” conﬁned ﬂares
might be the presence or absence of ﬂux ropes. In “Type I”
ﬂares,
the stable ﬁlaments probably correspond to sheared
magnetic arcades, not ﬂux ropes (Li et al. 2019). “Type II”

ﬂares are generated due to the failed eruption of ﬂux ropes. In
future, we can carry out the extrapolations of coronal magnetic
ﬁelds for the analyzed database and give a deﬁnite answer.
Moreover,
the triggering mechanism and the development
process of “Type I” conﬁned ﬂares are still unknown, so further
topological analyses and numerical simulations of these types
of ﬂares are required to build the 3D MHD ﬂare models.
