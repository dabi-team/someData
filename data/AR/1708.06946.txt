ABSTRACT

We observe intensity oscillations along coronal fan loops associated with the active region

AR 11428. The intensity oscillations were triggered by blast waves which were generated

due to X-class ﬂares in the distant active region AR 11429. To characterise the nature of

oscillations, we created time–distance maps along the fan loops and noted that the intensity

oscillations at two ends of the loops were out of phase. As we move along the fan loop, the

amplitude of the oscillations ﬁrst decreased and then increased. The out–of–phase nature

together with the amplitude variation along the loop implies that these oscillations are very

likely to be standing waves. The period of the oscillations are estimated to be ∼27 min,

damping time to be ∼45 min and phase velocity projected in the plane of sky ∼ 65–83 km

s−1. The projected phase speeds were in the range of acoustic speed of coronal plasma at

about 0.6 MK which further indicates that these are slow waves. To best of our knowledge,

this is the ﬁrst report on the existence of the standing slow waves in non–ﬂaring fan loops.

1. INTRODUCTION

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are ubiquitous in solar corona. With the advent of modern space

based instruments, diﬀerent types of wave modes have been observed in the last decade. Slow MHD modes

(compressional waves) were ﬁrst observed in the polar coronal holes using UVCS by Ofman et al. (1997).

Later, DeForest & Gurman (1998) and Ofman et al. (1999) reported propagating intensity disturbances

(PDs) in polar plumes using EIT onboard SOHO. Recently, several authors have reported that small scale

jets and spicules at transition region and chromosphere are associated with with PDs seen in polar plumes

and polar coronal holes (Pant et al. 2015; Jiao et al. 2015; Samanta et al. 2015; Bryans et al. 2016; Yuan et al.

2016). Reﬂections of propagating slow waves were also reported in hot and ﬂaring coronal loops using AIA

(Kumar et al. 2013, 2015) and XRT observations (Mandal et al. 2016). The authors have reported that these

waves are triggered by the ﬂares at the footpoint of the coronal loops. Recently, Fang et al. (2015) have

modelled reﬂective slow mode in ﬂaring loops using 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic simulation in synthetic

131 Å emission images.

Apart from propagating slow waves, ﬂare–excited standing slow waves have also been observed in hot

and ﬂaring coronal loops. Oscillations in Doppler velocity, detected in Fe xix, were reported in hot ﬂaring

coronal loops using SUMER/SOHO and SXT/Yokoh (Wang et al. 2002). Time period of oscillations was

found to be 14–18 min. These oscillations were interpreted as slow standing modes. Wang et al. (2003a,b)

have performed statistical study of slow standing modes in several hot coronal loops and post ﬂare loops,

respectively. They have reported a π/2 phase shift between Doppler velocities and line intensities of Fe xix

and Fe xxi emission lines (formation T > 6 MK) which is the signature of a standing slow modes (see also,

Wang 2011; Yuan et al. 2015).

3

The standing slow modes are believed to be triggered by an impulsive ﬂare which cause asymmetric heat-

ing at one footpoint of the coronal loop (Wang et al. 2005). However, Tsiklauri et al. (2004) performed a

numerical study of the longitudinal oscillations and reported that the excitation of standing oscillations is

independent of the location of the impulsive heating in the loop. Taroyan et al. (2005, 2007) have performed

1D hydrodynamic simulations of standing slow mode and showed that slow standing waves can be triggered

by impulsive foot point heating as well. Taroyan et al. (2007); Taroyan & Bradshaw (2008) have constructed

1D hydrodynamic loop model to study and distinguish between standing and propagating slow oscillations

in hot and cool coronal loops. They have reported that the phase of the intensity of the oscillation contin-

uously changes with time due to heating and cooling of loops. Yuan et al. (2015) have performed forward

modelling of standing slow modes in hot ﬂaring coronal loops (T > 6 MK) and studied their imaging and

spectroscopic signatures. The authors have reported that the amplitude of the oscillations along the loop

should vary depending on the mode of the oscillations.

Slow standing waves are found to be strongly damped. Ofman & Wang (2002) used a 1D MHD model to

study damped standing slow oscillations. The strong damping was attributed to large thermal conduction

which depends on the temperature of the loops. Recently, Wang et al. (2015) observed standing slow modes

in hot coronal loops using AIA 94 Å observations and reported that the thermal conduction, which is be-

lieved to damp the standing oscillations, is suppressed in hot coronal loops. Till today, standing slow modes

have been observed exclusively in hot coronal loops. A very limited number of standing slow mode waves

were detected by imaging observations. In this letter, we report the evidence of standing slow waves in cool

fan loops. The paper is organised as follows. In section 2, we describe the data processing used for this

study. In section 3, we describe the method of analysis which is followed by discussion and conclusions in

section 4

2. OBSERVATIONS

On 2012 March 7, a group of fan loops were observed near the active region AR 11428 (see Figure 1).

Two X-class ﬂares were detected consecutively at a distant active region, AR 11429 to the north west of

AR 11428. The approximate distance between AR 11428 and AR 11429 is about 455 Mm. The GOES

X-ray emission (inset in Figure 1) exhibit the evolution of the ﬂares. The X-ray ﬂux at two channels peaked

at 00:22 UT and 01:13 UT, respectively. The strength of two peaks corresponds to the ﬂuxes of X5 and

X1 classes, respectively. Both the X5 and X1 ﬂares originated from AR11429 and the associated energy

pulses reach AR11428 at 00:27UT and 01:15 UT, respectively. The fan loops were initially driven to move

transversely, and subsequently the intensity perturbations along the loops became detectable. A three-hour

data set (00:00 UT-03:00 UT) taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics

Observatory (SDO) (Lemen et al. 2012) was used for detailed analysis. The fan loops of interests are visible

in both 171 Å and 193 Å, so we only use these two channels for study.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Time evolution of intensity oscillations

To derive the properties of the oscillations, we placed three artiﬁcial slices, S1, S2, and S3, along the

fan loops as shown in Figure 2, at the locations where the intensity oscillations were clearly seen. We

chose broad artiﬁcial slices in order to capture the longitudinal oscillations despite they get displaced in

transverse direction due to interaction with the blast wave. It should be worth noting at this point that only

one footpoint, close to the active region, of fan loops was clearly visible in 171 and 193 Å. The length of

the artiﬁcial slices correspond to the distances along the fan loop up to which clear signatures of intensity

oscillations were observed. Therefore, the length of the artiﬁcial slices may not be equal to the length

of the fan loops. We discuss the estimation of the length of the fan loop in section 3.3. For each of the

three artiﬁcial slices, we generated a time–distance map, which will be termed as an x-t map, henceforth,

middle and right panels respectively. The signatures of intensity oscillations were clearer in AIA 171 Å as

compared to AIA 193 Å, because fan loops appeared more diﬀuse in AIA 193 Å. A possible reason for this

is discussed in section 3.4. The vertical lines in red in Figure 3 represent the instances when blast waves

hit the fan loops system. We noticed that the second blast wave hit fan loops when the intensity oscillations

driven by the ﬁrst blast wave were still present.

Figure 3 shows that the intensity oscillations were out of phase at the two ends of the artiﬁcial slices as

seen in the x-t maps. The out–of–phase signature was clearly seen in both AIA 171 and 193 Å. It is clear

from the Figure 3 that one reﬂection point (or antinode) of the oscillations was present near the one footpoint

which is clearly visible in the intensity images. While the other antinode was present at the other end of

the artiﬁcial slice which may or may not be close to the other footpoint. From movies 1 and 2 linked with

Figure 2, it is evident that the shape and appearance of fan loops was changed after the second blast wave

hit the fan loop system. Therefore, intensity oscillations were not clearly seen in x-t maps after second blast

wave hit the fan loops.

Figure 4 shows the variation of intensity with time at diﬀerent distances along the artiﬁcial slice S1. Y-

axis represents the relative intensity normalized to the local background. Two dashed vertical lines in red

represent the instant of time when blast wave hit fan loops. Since blast wave hit the fan loops twice, we ﬁtted

the sinusoidal and damped sinusoidal curve separately at two diﬀerent time intervals. Red curve represents

the best ﬁt sinusoidal curve. We should point out that the damping of the oscillations were not seen clearly

during the ﬁrst period of observation, which may be due to the impact of the second blast wave. Thus we

did not ﬁt damped sinusoidal curve during the ﬁrst time interval. However, we ﬁtted a damped sinusoidal

curve (shown in orange) in the second time interval and noticed the signature of damping at some locations

along the fan loops (e.g, at 5 Mm). The intensity of oscillations became undetectable after 120 min because

the shape and appearance of the fan loop changed (see movies 1 and 2). The estimated average period of

the oscillation, P and average damping times, τ, at the location of three slices, S1, S2 and S3 in 171 and

193 Å are listed in Table 1. Since only one oscillation was observed during second interval, there were large

uncertainties in the damping time. The quality factor (ratio of damping time by time period) estimated at

the location of three slices is also listed in Table 1. These oscillations are weakly damped as compared to

those reported earlier in hot coronal loops. A possible reason for weak damping is outlined in section 4.

8

3.2. Variation of amplitude of intensity oscillation

We noted that the relative amplitude (after normalising with background intensity) of the intensity oscil-

lations along S1 in 171 Å ﬁrst decreased and then increased while moving from one end at S1 (close to

one footpoint) to other (may be close to another footpoint) (see Figure 4). The variation can be seen clearly

for both curves ﬁtted at two separate time intervals shown in red and orange. Furthermore, the variation of

the amplitude at diﬀerent distances along S1, S2 and S3 in 171 and 193 Å is also shown in Figure 4. Sys-

temic decrease and increase of the amplitude of oscillations, while moving from one end of slice to another,

was seen at the location of all slices. This signature clearly indicate the existence of an anti-node near the

footpoints of the fan loop.

3.3. Estimation of loop length and velocity of the oscillations

The footpoint of the fan loop that was away from the active region was distributed and therefore, not seen

clearly in normal intensity images of 171 or 193 Å. Thus, it was not straightforward to measure the length of

the fan loops. Moreover, the shape and appearance of fan loops also changed with time (see movie 1 and 2).

To estimate the length, we chose the frames where the fan loops were best seen in normal intensity images.

We chose several points along the visible segment of the fan loops and interpolated a cubic spline between

them. The length of interpolated curve should be approximately equal to the projected length of the fan

loops. The orange curves in Figure 2 are the ﬁtted spline curves which represents the projected length of fan

loops at the location of three artiﬁcial slices. We found the length of the fan loops at the location of S1, S2

and S3 to be 62, 74 and 54 Mm, respectively (see Table 1). Note that the estimated length is the projected

length in the plane of sky. Assuming the length of fan loop as same in 171 and 193 Å, we estimated the

phase velocity of oscillations in 171 (193) Å to be 75 (85), 83 (101) and 65 (91) km s−1 at the location of

S1, S2 and S3, respectively. The phase velocity of oscillations, v, are comparable to the speed of sound in

171 and 193 Å.

3.4. Temperature and density of the fan loop

We estimated the temperature and density of the fan loop using automated diﬀerential emission measure

(DEM) technique as developed by Aschwanden et al. (2013). The temperature of the fan loops was found to

be ∼ 0.7 MK which are much cooler than the hot loops as observed by hot SUMER lines (Wang et al. 2002)

and in the AIA 94 Å channel (Wang et al. 2015). We also observed that the electron density decreased

along the loop. Since the temperature of fan loops is low, they appear brighter in 171 Å channel and diﬀuse

in hotter channels like 193 Å. We should point out that a fan loop may consists of several ﬁner strands and

we have not considered that scenario here.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We observe intensity oscillations in a non–ﬂaring fan loop system as seen in AIA 171 and 193 Å images.

The intensity variations were out of phase close to two footpoints of fan loops and the amplitude of the

intensity oscillations varied along fan loops at the location of artiﬁcial slices. The amplitude of intensity

oscillations ﬁrst decreased and then increased while moving from one footpoint to another along the fan

loop. It should be noted that it is diﬃcult to identify the diﬀerences between standing and propagating

waves without spectroscopic signatures. Recently, Yuan et al. (2015) have performed forward modelling of

standing slow magnetoacoustic waves in ﬂaring loops. They have reported that the variation of amplitude

along the coronal loops is one of the signatures of the standing slow magnetoacoustic waves (see, Figure 8

in Yuan et al. 2015). Moreover, small phase shift in the intensity variations with time at diﬀerent distances

along fan loop corresponding to the slice S1, as seen in Figure 4, can be due to the presence of standing

slow oscillations (Taroyan et al. 2007; Taroyan & Bradshaw 2008). We estimated the time period of the

11

oscillations ∼27 min and damping time ∼45 min. We calculated the projected length of the fan loops and

estimated that the velocity of oscillations are comparable to the velocity of sound in 171 and 193 Å. These

signatures allows us to conclude that the observed oscillations are due to standing slow waves in coronal fan

loops. The fan loops under study are associated with a sunspot. Yuan et al. (2011) reported presence of long

period oscillations in the coronal diﬀused plasma near an active region. The oscillations observed in this

study are diﬀerent from those reported by Yuan et al. (2011) because the event under study was triggered

by energy impulse of ﬂares, while Yuan et al. (2011) studied persistent leakage of long period oscillations

from the underneath sunspot.

It is worth mentioning that only one footpoint of fan loops was clearly seen in AIA 171 and 193 Å images.

At this stage we can only conjecture two possible scenarios by which the reﬂection of wave from other end

can happen. Either the antinode of the oscillations is present at the other footpoint which is distributed and

therefore not seen clearly in normal intensity images or the antinode could be present at the region of sharp

density contrast close to the other end of the fan loop. The region of sharp density change may have acted

as a reﬂecting surface. These scenario may be experimented in future studies using computer simulations.

At most of the locations along the fan loops, oscillations are found to be undamped. The reason for the

absence of damping at most of the locations is not clear to us, more observations of such events are required

to reach conclusive views on the damping. However at few locations along the fan loop, we indeed noted

weak damping. The oscillations at those locations are weakly damped as compared to those reported in

Ofman & Wang (2002); Wang et al. (2002, 2003b, 2015) where the damping time was comparable to the

time period of the oscillations in hot and ﬂaring coronal loops (T > 6 MK). One of the reason for weak

damping could be because the fan loops under study are not hot (∼ 0.7 MK), thus the thermal conduction

may not be eﬃcient enough. Since thermal conduction is one of the main mechanism to damp slow waves,

the oscillations were weakly damped in our study.

In summary, we found the signatures of standing slow magnetoacoustic waves in cool fan loops. In earlier

12

studies these oscillations were particularly observed in the hot coronal loops. To the best of our knowl-

edge, this is the ﬁrst report, on the observational signatures of the existence of weakly damped standing

oscillations in cool fan loops.
