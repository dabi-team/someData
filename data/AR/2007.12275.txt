Abstract

The physics of the solar chromosphere is complex from both theoretical and mod-

eling perspectives. The plasma temperature from the photosphere to corona increases

from ∼5,000 K to ∼1 million K over a distance of only ∼10,000 km from the chro-

mosphere and the transition region. Certain regions of the solar atmosphere have

suﬃciently low temperature and ionization rates to be considered as weakly-ionized.

In particular, this is true at the lower chromosphere. As a result, the Cowling resistiv-

ity is orders of magnitude greater than the Coulomb resistivity. Ohm’s law therefore

includes anisotropic dissipation. To evaluate the Cowling resistivity, we need to know

the external magnetic ﬁeld strength and to estimate the neutral fraction as a function

of the bulk plasma density and temperature. In this study, we determine the magnetic

ﬁeld topology using the non-force-free ﬁeld (NFFF) extrapolation technique based on

SDO/HMI SHARP vector magnetogram data, and the stratiﬁed density and temper-

ature proﬁles from the Maltby-M umbral core model for sunspots. We investigate the

variation and eﬀects of Cowling resistivity on heating and magnetic reconnection in the

chromosphere as the ﬂare-producing active region (AR) 11166 evolves. In particular,

we analyze a C2.0 ﬂare emerging from AR11166 and ﬁnd a normalized reconnection

rate of 0.051.

Introduction

The lower atmosphere of the Sun (i.e., photosphere and chromosphere) is composed of
weakly-ionized plasma. The low temperature in the photosphere results in an ionization
fraction of about ni/n ≈ 10−4 where 1 corresponds to fully ionized plasma. In the chromo-
sphere, the ionization fraction increases but always remains below 1 [Khomenko, 2016]. The
dominant mechanism for ionization in the chromosphere is photoionization with the rate for
hydrogen ≈ 0.014 s−1, which is orders of magnitude greater than the ionization rate due to
electron collisions of ≈ 7.8 × 10−5 s−1 [Peter & Marsch, 1998].

The plasma β exceeds 1 in the photosphere except for sunspot locations, and rapidly
decreases in the chromosphere [Gary, 2001]. The plasma β being high in the photosphere,
typical coronal magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation techniques based on nonlinear-force-free-ﬁelds
(NLFFFs), which are widely accepted by the solar community [Wiegelmann & Sakurai, 2012],
do not work very well as the Lorentz force is non-negligible in both photosphere and lower
chromosphere. A novel alternative to NLFFF is an extrapolation using non-force-free-ﬁelds
(NFFFs), which are described by the double-curl Beltrami equation for the magnetic ﬁeld B,
derived from the variational principle of minimum energy dissipation rate [Bhattacharyya
et al., 2007]. The equation was ﬁrst solved analytically to obtain magnetic ﬂux ropes that
resembled coronal loops [Bhattacharyya et al., 2007]. This technique is discussed in more
detail in section 2.

Cowling [1957] showed that the electrical conductivity (the Cowling conductivity) of a
non-stationary plasma can be signiﬁcantly decreased owing to ion acceleration by Ampere’s
force. Collisions between ion and neutral particles become very eﬀective because of the high
ion velocities. As a result, the magnetic ﬂux is not conserved and the rate of magnetic
reconnection might be considerably increased due to Joule’s (Ohmic) dissipation [Tsap &
Stepanov, 2010].

From the perspective of energy balance in the weakly-ionized chromosphere, Cowling
resistivity leads to additional dissipation of currents perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld
resulting in Joule heating that is several orders of magnitude larger compared to the fully
ionized plasma.

Section 2 describes the calculation of the Cowling resistivity. Section 3 presents results
and discusses the eﬀects of Cowling resistivity on heating and magnetic reconnection in the
chromosphere. In particular, we follow the evolution of AR11166, and its eﬀect on magnetic
reconnection and the formation of a C2.0 ﬂare. Finally, section 4 presents our conclusions.

2 Calculation of the Cowling Resistivity

To describe the interaction of chromospheric plasma with magnetic ﬁeld, and its dependence
on the degree of collisional coupling, we may apply a quasi-MHD single ﬂuid theory comple-
mented with a generalized Ohm’s law, or we may treat neutral and charged ﬂuids separately
as ﬂuids interacting by collisions [e.g. Leake et al., 2012]. In this paper, we adopt the former
approach according to the formulations given in Leake & Arber [2006].

Our main focus is on the calculation and eﬀects of Cowling resistivity. The anisotropic
dissipation of currents due to the presence of Cowling resistivity can be seen in the induction
and energy equations given in Eq. 1 and Eq. 2, respectively that illustrate the impact of the
presence of neutrals through the terms that contain ηC:

∂B
∂t

+ ∇ · (v B − Bv ) + ∇ × ηJ(cid:107) + ∇ × ηCJ⊥ = 0,

(v ·B)

B

−∇·(B ×ηJ(cid:107))−∇·(B ×ηCJ⊥) = ρ(v ·g ) +SN A. (2)

Here, η is the Coulomb resistivity, ηC is the Cowling resistivity, J(cid:107) and J⊥ are the components
of current density parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld B, E, p, ρ, v , and g
are speciﬁc total energy, thermal pressure, density, velocity, and gravitational acceleration,
respectively, and SN A is the combination of non-adiabatic source terms corresponding to
viscous heating, shock heating, thermal conduction, radiative transfer, and coronal heating.
Accordingly, the Cowling resistivity dissipates currents perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld while the Coulomb resistivity dissipates currents parallel to it. In addition, Cowling
resistivity contributes to heating the chromosphere via the frictional Joule heating term that
follows from the generalized Ohm’s law according to Leake & Arber [2006]:

Q = (E + (v × B)) · j = ηJ 2

(cid:107) + ηCJ 2
⊥.

(3)

To evaluate the expression for the Cowling resistivity, ηC, an estimate for the neutral fraction
ξn is required as a function of density and temperature (to be described below).

Following the method of De Pontieu [1999] an electro-neutral hydrogen plasma is as-
sumed. The solar chromosphere is not in LTE, hence a simple one-level model for the
hydrogen atom is inadequate for these conditions [Pottasch & Thomas, 1959]. To calcu-
late ionization degrees in a non-LTE situation requires the solution of the radiative transfer
and statistical equilibrium equations. These are very time consuming to calculate. For this

2

reason, approximations of non-LTE eﬀects on hydrogen ionization have been developed. Ac-
cordingly, a two-level model is used for the hydrogen atom, as this provides us with a good
approximation for hydrogen ionization at chromospheric densities and temperatures [Thomas
& Athay, 1961]. Under this approximation, the ionization equation [Brown, 1973] is solved
assuming that thermal collisional ionization is not important when compared to photoioniza-
tion [Ambartsumyan, 1958]. The steady state solution to this equation is given by Thomas
& Athay [1961] (i.e., the modiﬁed Saha equation for non-LTE chromosphere):

In this study, we prefer to utilize the steady state solution to the ionization equation
via the modiﬁed Saha equation to solving non-equilibrium ionization of hydrogen in a time-
dependent manner [Mart´ınez-Sykora et al., 2020] since we calculate ηC based on the SHARP
vector magnetogram data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager [HMI; Schou et al.,
2012] onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory [SDO; Pesnell et al., 2012] at 13 timesteps
with a cadence of 8 hours (see subsection 3.1).

To calculate the Coulomb and Cowling resistivities, we need the plasma bulk density ρ
and temperature T as well as the ion and electron number densities, ni and ne, in the chro-
mosphere where ρ, T , ne, and nH, which is the total hydrogen number density, are tabulated
by the Maltby-M umbral core model [Maltby et al., 1986] for sunspots (see Figure 1). To
calculate ni, we use ni = nH −ne
r+1 . We compute the magnetic ﬁeld from the NFFF extrapo-
lation technique based on the photospheric vector magnetograms from SDO/HMI SHARP
data series.

The NFFF extrapolation technique used in this paper was developed by Hu & Dasgupta

[2008], Hu et al. [2008, 2010]. Here, the magnetic ﬁeld B is written as

B = B1 + B2 + B3; ∇ × Bi = αiBi

(15)

where, for i = 1, 2, 3, each subﬁeld Bi corresponds to a linear-force-free ﬁeld (LFFF) with
corresponding constants αi. Further, without loss of generality, we choose α1 (cid:54)= α3 and
α2 = 0 making B2 a potential ﬁeld. Subsequently, an optimal pair of α = {α1, α3} is
obtained by an iterative trial-and-error method which ﬁnds the pair that minimizes the
average deviation between the observed (Bt) and the calculated (bt) transverse ﬁelds on the
photospheric boundary. This is estimated by the following metric [Prasad et al., 2018]:

(16)

where M = N 2 represents the total number of grid points on the transverse plane. To
minimize the contribution from the weaker ﬁelds, the grid points are here weighted with
respect to the strength of the observed transverse ﬁeld; see Hu et al. [2010] for further
details.

The extrapolated ﬁeld B is a solution of an auxiliary higher-curl equation

∇ × ∇ × ∇ × B + a1∇ × ∇ × B + b1∇ × B = 0,

(17)

which contains a second order derivative (∇ × ∇ × B)z = −∇2Bz at z = 0 necessitating the
requirement of vector magnetograms at two or more layers for evaluating the B. To work
with the available single layer vector magnetograms, an algorithm was devised by Hu et al.

5

[2010] that involved additional iterations to successively correct the potential subﬁeld B2.
Starting with an initial guess, B2 = 0, the system is reduced to second order which allows for
the determination of boundary conditions for B1 and B3 using the trial-and-error process
If the resulting minimum En value is not satisfactory, then a corrector
described above.
potential ﬁeld to B2 is derived from the diﬀerence transverse ﬁeld, i.e., Bt − bt, and added to
the previous B2 in anticipation of better agreement between the transverse ﬁelds as measured
by En. This optimization procedure during which En is iteratively minimized is automatic.
In the present case, to minimize the computational cost, we ran the code for 1000 iterations
during which we noted that En asymptotically reached a value of 0.15. The algorithm relies
on the implementation of fast calculations of the LFFFs including the potential ﬁeld. Such
extrapolations have been applied recently to model initial ﬁelds for ﬂares and jets [Prasad
et al., 2018, Mitra et al., 2018, Liu et al., 2020].

Figure 2 (top left) shows the HMI SHARP magnetogram data for the magnetic ﬁeld
component along the z-axis in the heliographic coordinate system, Bz, for AR11166 at 2011-
03-07T06:00:29 UT (hereafter called t0) with the polarity inversion lines (PILs) in green and
transverse magnetic ﬁeld vectors. Figure 2 (top right) shows the corresponding NFFF mag-
netic ﬁeldlines. Figure 2 (middle left) shows that the Cowling resistivity is mostly important
between 1-2 Mm height above the photosphere. The NFFF extrapolations for AR11166
were performed using the HMI vector magnetograms taken from the “hmi.sharp cea 720s”
data series on a domain consisting of 560 × 352 × 352 pixels in the x, y and z directions,
respectively. Since each pixel in HMI magnetogram corresponds to 0.5 arcsec, the horizontal
extent of the box in x corresponds to ∼200 Mm.

The NFFF extrapolations correctly capture the Lorentz force distribution, which is also
principally concentrated around 1-2 Mm height (see Figure 2 middle right). The Lorentz
force is then found to fall oﬀ sharply with height bringing the magnetic ﬁeld close to a
force-free state in the corona as shown in Figure 2 (bottom left and right).

3 Results & Discussion

In this section, we will present results related to the variation of Cowling resistivity during
the evolution of AR11166. We chose AR11166 for our analysis for the following reasons: (i)
It has 3-5 days coverage within a meridional range of [-40◦,40◦] without any data gaps, and
a ﬂare occurs during this period and in this region; (ii) the early stage of the AR starts on
the left limb and increases in complexity during its passage; and (iii) the AR is somewhat
compact so that our NFFF extrapolations can be run at full resolution.

We observe the evolution of AR11166 at 13 timesteps between t0 and tf with a cadence
of 8 hours. Figure 3 (left) shows the variations of the maximum values of Cowling and
Coulomb resistivity proﬁles with height at t0. The Cowling resistivity is orders of magnitude
larger than the Coulomb resistivity in the chromosphere, speciﬁcally 6-8 orders of magnitude
larger between 1-2 Mm. Figure 3 (right) presents the variation of the maximum values of
the frictional Joule heating proﬁles with height in the chromosphere due to Cowling and
Coulomb resistivities, showing that the chromospheric heating due to the dissipation of
currents perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld dominates the heating due to the dissipation
of currents parallel to it. This ﬁgure demonstrates the signiﬁcance of Cowling resistivity for
chromospheric heating. Figure 3 (bottom) shows the time-dependent variation of Cowling
resistivity at ∼1.8 Mm height during the evolution of AR11166. Since the Cowling resistivity
distribution follows the AR structure quite well (see Figure 2 middle left) primarily due to
its strong dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld strength, its time variation shown in Figure 3
(bottom) can reveal how diﬀerent structures on the AR evolve in time. Accordingly, the AR
structures at the upper-right and upper-left do not change much as can be deduced from the
vertical non-interacting contour structures whereas the other structures interact with each
other above the PIL (see the animation corresponding to Figure 2 top left).

3.2 The eﬀect of Cowling resistivity on magnetic reconnection

Since the Cowling resistivity is orders of magnitude larger than the Coulomb resistivity in the
chromosphere, it can in principle increase the magnetic reconnection rate signiﬁcantly, and
hence play a role in the ﬂare formation, especially in a low-lying 3D null point conﬁguration.
In Figure 4, we show such a 3D null point conﬁguration at 2011-03-10T14:23:36 UT
resulting in the C2.0 ﬂare (see Figure 4 caption for details) emerging from AR11166 with its
location being in a region where the Cowling resistivity is dominant.

According to Vishniac & Lazarian [1999], the normalized magnetic reconnection rate

(NRR) can be written as

v
vA

≈

(cid:114) ηC
vAL

,

(18)

where ηC = ηC/µ0 and µ0 is the magnetic permeability in vacuum.

In Figure 5, the reconnection current sheet is shown using |J|/|B| contours. Accordingly,
|J|/|B| ∼ 1/LCS [Jiang et al., 2016] where LCS is the width of the current sheet. The |J|/|B|
contour value in the current sheet is 0.5 which gives LCS = 2 pixels. The pixel size in our
computation box for applying NFFF is 0.5 arcsec ≈ 362 km which is also equal to the half

speed vA = 1563 km/s in the vicinity of the 3D null point, NRR is found as 0.051. This
value is in agreement with Xue et al. [2016] and the references therein.

current sheet [Jiang et al., 2016].

According to the Sweet-Parker reconnection model, the characteristic half thickness of a

current sheet can be written as

l ∼

(cid:114)ηCL
vA

,

(19)

which results in a current sheet thickness of 37 km compared to 25 m found for Coulomb
resistivity.

Studies involving direct observational evidence of magnetic reconnection are relatively
rare. Xue et al. [2016] estimates NRR as the Alfv´enic Mach number of the inﬂow velocity
similar to Eq. 18. They consider this as an upper limit for NRR since the outﬂow velocity
may not generally reach the Alfv´en velocity and the current sheet width obtained from the
images is considered an upper limit for the actual width of the ﬁeld reversal. Similarly,
replacing the Coulomb resistivity with the Cowling resistivity as in Eq. 18 gives an upper
limit for NRR as the inﬂow velocity, v, in Eq. 18 gives the maximum reconnection speed that
is obtainable through ambipolar diﬀusion [Vishniac & Lazarian, 1999] or Cowling resistivity.
There are also numerical studies that simulate the magnetic reconnection in a partially-
ionized chromosphere. Leake et al. [2012] solves a multi-ﬂuid reacting hydrogen plasma model
that takes ionization imbalance into account resulting in a reconnection rate which is almost
independent of the Lundquist number. In this study, we follow the single-ﬂuid approach due
to Leake & Arber [2006] which implicitly assumes that the ions and neutrals are in ionization
balance and follows the interactions between the ions and neutrals by the Cowling resistivity.

11

Despite the diﬀerences between the models, our estimate for NRR of 0.051 is in agreement
with the simulated and observed values in Leake et al. [2012] and Xue et al. [2016] and the
references therein, respectively.

4 Conclusions

In this paper, we calculated the Cowling resistivity using the magnetic ﬁeld obtained from
NFFF extrapolation of photospheric vector magnetogram data, and density and tempera-
ture values from the Maltby-M model. We also discussed its eﬀects in the weakly-ionized
chromosphere during the evolution of an AR and on ﬂare formation associated with magnetic
reconnection in the chromosphere.

We analyzed the evolution of AR11166. The Cowling resistivity is found to be 6-8
orders of magnitude larger than the Coulomb resistivity between 1-2 Mm height in the
chromosphere. It has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the chromospheric heating via frictional Joule
heating due to current dissipation perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The time-dependent
evolution of Cowling resistivity gives an indication about the AR evolution since it follows
the AR structure quite closely due to its strong dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld strength.
We also analyzed the eﬀect of Cowling resistivity on the formation of a C2.0 ﬂare that
emerged from AR11166. The Cowling resistivity can have an eﬀect on ﬂare formation for a
low-lying 3D null point conﬁguration that occurs at a height of ∼1.9 Mm where we have a
signiﬁcant Lorentz force distribution and the Cowling resistivity has its largest value. We
obtain an NRR of 0.051 which is in agreement with Leake et al. [2012] and Xue et al. [2016]
and the references therein, and a relatively thick current sheet with a thickness of 37 km in
the chromosphere. We also ﬁnd a good match between the AIA brightening with the log
Q contours and the location of the null point inferred from the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld
topology.

In future work, we will focus on analyzing the eﬀects of Cowling resistivity for a ﬂare
using HMI SHARP vector magnetogram data with 12-minute cadence including observations
before and after the ﬂare. We also plan to utilize the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
[IRIS ; De Pontieu et al., 2014] data to determine the density and temperature structures of
the corresponding AR with height in the chromosphere instead of the Maltby-M model.
