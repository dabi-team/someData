Several states of proton-unbound isotopes 30Ar and 29Cl were investigated by measuring their
in-ﬂight decay products, 28S+proton+proton and 28S+proton, respectively. A reﬁned analysis of
28S-proton angular correlations indicates that the ground state of 30Ar is located at 2.45+0.05
−0.10 MeV
above the two-proton emission threshold. The theoretical investigation of the 30Ar ground state
decay demonstrates that its mechanism has the transition dynamics with a surprisingly strong
sensitivity of the correlation patterns of the decay products to the two-proton decay energy of the
30Ar ground state and the one-proton decay energy as well as the one-proton decay width of the
29Cl ground state. The comparison of the experimental 28S-proton angular correlations with those
resulting from Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response illustrates that other observed 30Ar
excited states decay by sequential emission of protons via intermediate resonances in 29Cl. Based
on the ﬁndings, the decay schemes of the observed states in 30Ar and 29Cl were constructed. For
calibration purposes and for checking the performance of the experimental setup, decays of the
previously-known states of a two-proton emitter 19Mg were remeasured. Evidences for one new
excited state in 19Mg and two unknown states in 18Na were found.

INTRODUCTION

Two-proton (2p) radioactivity is an exotic nuclear
decay mode resulting in the simultaneous emission of
It was proposed for the ﬁrst time by
two protons.
Goldansky in the early 1960s [1].
In this pioneering
work, simultaneous two-proton emission was predicted to

appear in the even-proton number (Z) isotopes beyond
the proton drip-line, in which one-proton (1p) emission is
energetically prohibited but the ejection of two protons
is energetically allowed due to the pairing interaction.
More than 40 years after its prediction, ground-state
2p radioactivity was discovered in 2002 [2, 3]. Two
experiments independently observed that the ground
state (g.s.) of 45Fe decays by simultaneous emission of
two protons. Later 54Zn [4], 19Mg [5], 48Ni [6], and
67Kr [7] were found to be other g.s. 2p radioactive nuclei.

Among the g.s. 2p emitters hitherto observed, the half-
lives of 45Fe, 48Ni, and 54Zn are in the range of several ms,

which can be accessed by the conventional implantation-
decay method. In the case of 19Mg, whose half-life was
predicted in the range from a few ps to a few ns [8],
a technique based on particle tracking of decays in ﬂight
(see details in Ref. [9]) was applied in order to investigate
its decay properties. In this experiment, the trajectories
of 2p decay products of 19Mg were measured by double-
sided silicon micro-strip detectors. The 2p-decay vertices
and fragment correlations were reconstructed. The 2p
decay energy and half-life of 19Mg g.s. were determined,
which represented the ﬁrst case of 2p radioactivity in s-
d shell nuclei [5]. In a recent work [10], the half-life of 2p
decay of 19Mg g.s. was measured by another experimental
technique, the extracted half-life value is consistent with
the ﬁrst measurements.

After

the discovery of 2p radioactivity several
theoretical eﬀorts were dedicated to predictions of the
2p radioactivity landscape.
In a systematic study of
lifetime dependencies on the decay energy and three-
body correlations applied to a number of isotopes by
using a three-body model [8], dozens of prospective true
2p emitters were predicted. Among these candidates,
19Mg, 48Ni, and 54Zn have been proven to be indeed true
2p emitters. In a recent study, the global landscape of
g.s. 2p radioactivity has been quantiﬁed by the energy
density functional theory [11]. The main conclusion of
this work is that 2p-decaying isotopes exist in almost
every isotopic chain between elements Ar and Pb, which
indicates that g.s. 2p radioactivity is a typical feature for
the proton-unbound isotopes with even atomic numbers.
Those theoretical predictions provide guidance for the
experimental search of 2p radioactive nucleus.
For
instance, 30Ar was predicted to be an s-d shell true 2p
emitter by the three-body model [8]. The prediction
for the 30Ar g.s. half-life was T1/2(30Ar) = 0.7 - 33 ps
and the predicted separation energies were S2p(30Ar) =
−1.43 MeV and Sp(30Ar) = 0.35 MeV, respectively.
Considering its short lifetime, the in-ﬂight decay method
was applied. Several states in 30Ar and its 1p-decay
daughter nucleus 29Cl were investigated. The observation
of 30Ar and 29Cl low-lying states, including their g.s.,
was reported in Ref. [12]. The assigned ground and ﬁrst
excited states of 29Cl were found at 1.8+0.1
−0.1 MeV and
2.3+0.1
−0.1 MeV above the 1p threshold, respectively. The
g.s. of 30Ar was found to be at 2.25+0.15
−0.10 MeV above
the 2p emission threshold [12]. A sophisticated data
analysis together with theoretical investigations revealed
that the g.s. of 30Ar is located at 2.45+0.05
−0.10 MeV above
the 2p emission threshold [13]. Due to a strong Thomas-
Ehrman shift, the lowest states in 30Ar and 29Cl point to
a violation of isobaric mirror symmetry in the structure
of these unbound nuclei. Detailed investigations of the
decay mechanism of the 30Ar ground state show that it
is located in a transition region between simultaneous
2p decay and sequential emission of protons. Such an
interplay between the true three-body and the sequential
two-body decay mechanism is the ﬁrst-time observation
for nuclear ground state decays. For the ﬁrst excited

2+ state of 30Ar, the hint on so-called ﬁne structure
in the 2p decay was obtained by detecting two decay
branches either into the ground state or ﬁrst excited state
of 28S [12].

Besides the g.s. and ﬁrst excited states, several higher-
lying excited states of 30Ar and 29Cl were also populated
in this experiment. The present manuscript describes
the details of the experiment and reports the ﬁrst
spectroscopy of observed excited states. The structure
of the present manuscript is organized in the following
way. To begin with, the experimental setup is introduced
ion-optic
with the emphasis on the employed special
settings. Then the nuclear structure information on
several observed states of the known 2p emitter 19Mg
is presented. Afterwards, the detailed analysis of the
angular correlations between decay products and the
extraction of the decay properties of several excited states
of 30Ar as well as 29Cl is described. Finally, discussions
on the transition dynamics of 30Ar g.s. decays and the
decay mechanisms of observed excited states of 30Ar are
presented.

II. EXPERIMENT

The 30Ar experiment was performed at the Fragment
Separator (FRS) [14] at GSI (Darmstadt, Germany).
The FRS was operated with ion-optical settings in a
separator-spectrometer mode. The primary 885 MeV/u
36Ar beam with an intensity up to 2 × 109 s−1 impinged
on a 8 g/cm2 9Be production target. The 620 MeV/u
31Ar fragments with an average intensity of 50 s−1 were
selected as a secondary beam and transported by the
ﬁrst half of the FRS to bombard a 9Be reaction target
located at the middle focal plane F2 of the FRS. The
thickness and the transverse dimension of the reaction
target is 4.8 g/cm2 and 5 × 5 cm2, respectively. At
the ﬁrst focal plane F1 of the FRS, an aluminum wedge
degrader was installed in order to achieve an achromatic
focusing of 31Ar at the reaction target. 30Ar nuclei were
produced via one-neutron (1n) knockout from the 31Ar
ions. The decay products of 30Ar were tracked by a
double-sided silicon micro-strip detector array placed just
downstream of the reaction target. The projectile-like
outgoing particles from the reaction target were analyzed
by the second half of the FRS, which was operated as a
magnetic spectrometer. The magnet settings between
the focal planes F2 and F4 were tuned to transmit the
targeted heavy ion (HI) fragments (e.g., 28S) down to the
last focal plane F4.

The above-mentioned operation mode of the FRS
requires a special ion-optical setting. Since the transverse
dimensions of the reaction target and the tracking
detectors are small, a focused secondary beam is required
in order to have a small beam spot on the reaction
target. Such a requirement was fulﬁlled by employing
a wedge-shaped aluminum degrader to compensate the
momentum deviation (from the reference particle) of the

secondary beam. The thickness of the degrader along
the optical axis was 5 g/cm2 and the wedge angle was
194 mrad. Fig. 1 shows the ion-optical setting of the
FRS used in the experiment, which was calculated with
the code GICOSY [15, 16]. The colored lines show the
trajectories of 31Ar ions at three diﬀerent energies, each
at ﬁve diﬀerent angles after production by fragmenting a
36Ar beam on the 9Be production target. By combining
the ion-optical elements of the FRS (dipole magnets and
quadrupole magnets) and the energy loss in the degrader,
the optical system TA–F2 was tuned to spatially separate
the 31Ar fragment beam from other fragments and to
provide an achromatic image at the middle focal plane
F2. The horizontal (X) slits at F1 (not shown in Fig. 1)
and F2 were employed to assist in rejecting the unwanted
ions at F2. The second half of the FRS was operated in
a dispersive mode and the 28S ions were transmitted as
the centered beam down to F4, where the full Particle
IDentiﬁcation (PID) in A and Z can be performed. The
transmission properties of the FRS may be described by
the calculated longitudinal momentum (p) and angular
acceptance. For the section TA–F2, the momentum
acceptance (∆p/p) was limited by closing the slits at
F1 to ∆p/p = ±0.71%. The corresponding angular
acceptance in the horizontal plane (X plane) was ±14
mrad, while the angular acceptance in the vertical plane
(Y plane) was ±13 mrad. For a beam between F2 and F4,
the momentum acceptance was ±2.8% and the angular
acceptance was ±20 mrad in both X and Y planes.

The detectors employed in the present experiment
are sketched in Fig. 2.
The locations of tracking
detectors were mainly at the FRS middle focal plane,
F2. Two Time-Projection Chambers (TPC1 and TPC2)
were used to track the positions of incoming 31Ar (or
20Mg) projectiles. A double-sided silicon micro-strip
detector (DSSD) array, which consists of four large-area
DSSDs [17] was employed to measure hit coordinates
of the two protons and the recoil heavy ion (28S or
17Ne) resulting from the in-ﬂight 2p decay. The high-
precision position measurement by DSSDs allowed us to

FIG. 2: Sketch of the detector setup. The secondary beam
AZ (31Ar or 20Mg) was tracked by position sensitive detectors
TPC1 and TPC2 before impinging on the reaction target.
The trajectories of two protons and HI daughter nucleus
A−3(Z − 2) resulting from the decay of 2p precursor A−1Z
(30Ar or 19Mg) were measured by the DSSD array. At the
focal plane F4, the energy deposition of HI in the detector

F4 (∼35 m) was measured by using the scintillator detectors

reconstruct fragment trajectories and to derive the decay
vertex together with angular HI-proton and proton-
proton correlations. In the second half of the FRS, the
heavy ions arriving at the ﬁnal focal plane of the FRS F4
were unambiguously identiﬁed by their magnetic rigidity
Bρ, time-of-ﬂight (TOF), and energy deposition ∆E.
The Bρ of the ion was determined from the FRS magnet
setting and the ion’s position measured with TPCs. The
TOF for the ion traveling from F2 to F4 was measured
by using the scintillator SCI1 at F2 and scintillator SCI2
at F4. Then the ion’s velocity (v) can be deduced from
its TOF. Once the v is obtained, the mass-to-charge ratio
(A/Q) can be determined by using the following equation

of c (β = v/c), γ is the Lorentz factor (γ =
Given the fact that the energy deposition (∆E) of the HI
in the MUltiple Sampling Ionizing Chamber (MUSIC) is
nearly proportional to the square of the ion’s charge Q,
the Q can be calculated form the ∆E measured by the
MUSIC detector. At the high energies used in the present
experiment (several hundred MeV/u), most of ions are
fully stripped, thus we assume Q = Z. Therefore,
the HI’s proton number Z can be determined from ∆E
measurements. By plotting the distribution of Z versus
A/Q, the identiﬁcation of HI can be achieved since each
isotope has a unique combination of Z and A/Q. Fig. 3
shows a two-dimensional PID plot for the ions which
reached F4. In this plot, each nuclide occupies a unique
position according to its proton number and mass-to-
charge ratio. Therefore, the heavy ion of interest can be
identiﬁed unambiguously. The ions of interest including
28S and 31Ar are well separated from other species and
they are highlighted by the circles.

from 2p decays of 19Mg are described. Based on the
measured trajectories of 17Ne and two protons which
were emitted by the 2p decay of 19Mg, the angle between
the 17Ne and proton’s trajectories (θNe-p) as well as the
angle between both protons’ trajectories (θp-p) can be
obtained. The corresponding 17Ne-p angular correlations
were reconstructed for all 17Ne + p + p coincidences.
Fig. 4(a) shows the scatter plot (θNe-p1, θNe-p2) for the
measured angles between 17Ne and both protons. Since
the two protons cannot be distinguished, the distribution
is symmetrized with respect to proton permutations, and
proton indexes are given for illustration purpose only. In
this angular correlation plot, there are several intensity
enhancements which provide the information on the 2p
states in 19Mg and 1p resonances in 18Na.

transmit the 28S ions.

For each identiﬁed 28S nucleus, the coincident protons
were identiﬁed by registering their impact position
in several DSSD’s and by requiring a “straight-line”
trajectory in the analysis. Afterwards, several conditions
and thresholds were applied in order to identify the
28S+p+p coincidence. The procedure can be divided into
three steps. First, the trajectories of protons and of 28S
were reconstructed by using the coordinates measured
by DSSDs. Second, the closest approach between proton
trajectory and 28S ion trajectory was measured and
tested by checking whether it is a vertex for a 28S +
p double coincidence. Third, the diﬀerence between the
Z coordinates of two vertices (Zdiﬀ) derived from two 28S
+ p double coincidences was calculated and the Zdiﬀ was
tested by another threshold to identify the 28S + p + p
triple coincidence. If a triple coincidence 28S + p + p was
identiﬁed, an 30Ar 2p decay event was assumed to be
found. The detailed description of the search procedure
for the 2p decay events can be found in Ref. [18].

19Mg were also produced by a

fragmenting a 685 MeV/u 36Ar beam. The 2p decay
properties of 19Mg were remeasured. By following the
same procedure applied in previous studies of 19Mg [5, 9,
19], the decay properties of the precursors 19Mg and 30Ar
were investigated on the basis of angular correlations
between the HI daughter nucleus and the protons. In this
section, the angular 17Ne-proton correlations obtained

Ne-p2 = const .

Since ρθ is related to the energy sum of both emitted
protons and therefore to the Q2p of the parent state by
the relation Q2p ∼ ρ2
θ [19], one can obtain the indication
of the parent state and its 2p-decay energy by studying
the distribution of ρθ. The ρθ spectrum has a few
peaks which allow us to select speciﬁc excitation-energy
regions for the investigation. In the present study, the ρθ
distribution measured for 19Mg 2p decays is displayed in
Fig. 4 (b). Several well-separated intense peaks, which
indicate the 2p decays of various states in 19Mg, are
clearly seen and labeled by Roman numerals. The peak
in Fig. 4 (b) corresponds to the arc in Fig. 4 (a) labeled
with the same Roman numeral. By gating on a particular
ρθ peak, the decay events from a certain 19Mg state
can be selected.
In the following, the states observed
in 19Mg will be investigated by comparing the measured
17Ne-p angular correlations with the Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations of the detector response.

A. Reference case: 1p and 2p decays of known
states in 18Na and 19Mg

By comparing the θNe-p angular correlations [Fig. 4(a)]
with those obtained in the previous experiment (see
Figure 2(c) in Ref. [19]), it was found that several known
states of 19Mg including its g.s. and several low-lying
excited states were observed in the present experiment.
They are shown by the peaks and arcs (i), (ii), (iii), and
(iv) in Fig. 4.
In order to quantitatively interpret the
17Ne-p angular correlations obtained from the decays of
these known states, MC simulations were performed by
assuming the simultaneous 2p decay of the 19Mg g.s. and
the sequential 2p decay of 19Mg excited states via low-
lying 18Na states. The simulated θNe-p distributions were
compared with the data obtained by choosing events with
the ρθ gates (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) indicated in Fig. 4
(b). The corresponding results are shown in the panels
(a), (b), (c) and (d) of Fig. 5, respectively. One can
see that the simulations reproduce the data well. The
deduced 2p-decay energy (Q2p) of the g.s. shown in (i)
is 0.87+0.24
−0.07 MeV, which is consistent with the previous
result of 0.76(6) MeV [19]. The deduced Q2p values of the
excited state (ii) and excited state (iv) are 2.5+0.8
−0.4 MeV
and 5.1+0.3
−0.3 MeV, respectively, which agree within the
errors with the previous data on the respective states at
2.14(23) MeV and 5.5(2) MeV [19]. The determined Q2p
for the broad peak (iii) is 3.2+1.2
−1.0 MeV, which matches
the previously-measured states at 2.9(2) and 3.6(2) MeV.
However, these two states cannot be resolved in the
present experiment.

In Fig. 4(b), besides the known excited states of 19Mg
shown by the peaks (ii), (iii), and (iv), evidence on
a new excited state of 19Mg is displayed by the peak
(v) which is located around ρθ = 130 mrad. The
corresponding θNe-p1 versus θNe-p2 distribution is shown
by the arc (v) in Fig. 4(a). One can see that most
events fall into several clusters which indicate sequential
emission of protons from one excited state of 19Mg via
intermediate resonances of 18Na. It is worth mentioning
that the hints to sequential proton emission from such
an unknown excited state of 19Mg can be also found
in the experimental spectrum obtained from a previous
study of 19Mg (see Fig. 2(c) of [19]). Despite the low
counts, the peak (v) and multiple-cluster structure in the
corresponding arc (v) are quite evident, which may be
attributed to a diﬀerent detection scheme being applied
thus leading to a better signal to noise ratio in the present
experiment. The angular θNe-p spectrum obtained by
imposing the arc gate (v) (119.0 < ρθ < 146.0 mrad) is
shown by the black dots in Fig. 5(e). Such a multiple
peak structure cannot be described by a sequential 2p
decay via any previously-known 18Na state because the
characteristic θNe-p pattern generated from 1p decay of
the known state in 18Na does not ﬁt any peak shown in
Fig. 5(e). In order to interpret such experimental θNe-p
spectrum, the existence of two new 18Na levels has to be
assumed.

The hints of two new states expected for 18Na can be
found in Fig. 6, which displays the comparison of angular
θNe-p correlations obtained from the measured 17Ne + p
and 17Ne + p + p coincidences in the present experiment.
In the former case, parent 18Na states may be populated
via several possible reactions on 20Mg, while the latter
distribution is presumably due to the 2p emission from
19Mg states. Five peaks (1-5) which coexist in both
histograms suggest the states of 18Na. According to the
previous knowledge on the angular correlations obtained
from the decays of known 18Na states [19], the peaks 1-
3 correspond to the the 18Na states at 1.23 MeV, 1.55
MeV, and 2.084 MeV, respectively. The peaks 4 and
5 provide indications of two unknown excited states in
18Na, which are located at 2.5 MeV and 4.0 MeV above
the 1p threshold, respectively.

The two above-discussed new states in 18Na provide a
possible explanation for the observed θNe-p distribution
i.e., such a 17Ne-proton angular
shown in Fig. 5(e),
correlations may originate from the decays of a previously
unknown excited state in 19Mg by sequential emission of
protons via the above-mentioned two 18Na excited states
To verify such a tentative assignment, MC simulations
were performed. By varying the decay energies and
lifetimes of 19Mg state and 18Na levels, we found that

In particular, the multiple-peak structure of
the experimental pattern is reasonably described. The
energy level of 18Na around 2.5 MeV has been predicted

in a theoretical work [20]. Given the fact that the
limited amount of 19Mg 2p decay events identiﬁed in
the present experiment provides only hints of a new
19Mg excited state and two new 18Na excited states,
future experiments with improved conditions (e.g., better
statistics) are desirable.

28S-proton angular correlations

"A"

As described in Sec. II, the decays of 30Ar were
28S + p + p
identiﬁed by tracking the coincident
trajectories.
Following a similar procedure to that
conducted for 2p decays of 19Mg, we measured the
angles between the decay products of 30Ar (i.e., θS-p and
θp1-p2) and then reconstructed the 28S-proton angular
correlations as well as the decay vertices. The scatter
plot of θS-p1 versus θS-p2 for all identiﬁed 28S + p + p
coincidences is shown in Fig. 7(a). Here proton indexes
are given for illustration purposes only. Several intensity
enhancements can be observed in this angular correlation
plot, and they indicate on the 2p states in 30Ar and
1p resonances in 29Cl. The arcs labeled “A-H” in
Fig. 7(a) correspond to peaks in the ρθ spectrum
shown in Fig. 7(b), where ρθ = qθ2
S-p2. As
demonstrated in the previous chapter, the ρθ distribution
is helpful in order to identify the states of 30Ar and to
discriminate transitions of interest.
In Fig. 7(b), the
peaks labeled “A-H” suggest several states in 30Ar, and
the corresponding arcs in Fig. 7(a) illustrate the 28S-
proton angular correlation patterns. These arcs and
peaks demonstrate the ﬁrst observation of 2p decays from
several states of the nucleus 30Ar.
In order to deduce
the nuclear structure information on these states and
investigate their decay properties, careful analysis of θS-p

θS-p distributions of states observed in 30Ar

Since the θS-p distributions reﬂect energy spectra
of protons emitted from the 2p decay of 30Ar states,
they provide insight into the decay mechanisms of the
parent states. The pattern of the θS-p distribution
carries information on the decay branches of the 30Ar
state. Fig. 8 displays the θS-p spectra obtained from
the measured 28S + p + p coincidences which are selected
by imposing the ρθ gates “A”, “B”, “C”, “D1”, “D2”,
“E”, “F1”, “F2”, “G”, and “H” shown in Fig. 7. The

exhibits a relatively broad peak which corresponds to
the half of the total 2p-decay energy Q2p. In the case
of the sequential emission of protons, a typical double-
peak structure appears in the proton spectrum, and the
two peaks are related to the decay energies of two 1p
decays,
i.e., one peak is located at the decay energy
of the intermediate state of 1p-decay daughter nucleus
(Q1p) and the other peak is located around the 1p-
decay energy of the mother nucleus (i.e., Q2p − Q1p).
Moreover, multiple-peak structures may also be present
in the proton spectrum, which indicate two or more decay
branches. Therefore, one can obtain hints of the decay
mechanism on the basis of the angular θS-p distribution.
In the case of 30Ar, one can see in Fig. 8 that except
the state “B”, all other 30Ar states show two or more
θS-p peaks, which indicate a sequential decay mechanism.
Concerning peak “B”, the angular 28S-proton spectrum
presents a relatively broad peak which is almost twice
more wide than that expected for a simultaneous 2p
decay. On the other hand, the spectrum does not point
to a sequential 2p emission, where the typical double-
peak structure appears. Such an unexpected pattern
was carefully studied in our previous work [12]. There,
the peak “B” has been assigned to the g.s. of 30Ar. Its
decay mechanism was identiﬁed in a transition region
between simultaneous 2p decay and sequential emission
of protons. The peak “C” was regarded as the ﬁrst
excited state of 30Ar. The decay of this state presents
the ﬁrst hint of a ﬁne structure in the 2p decay, which
provides the natural interpretation of the peak “A” and
peak “C” [12]. In the present work, we will discuss the
excited states of 30Ar with decay energies higher than

that of the peak “C” and deduce their decay properties
and decay mechanisms. Regarding the state “H” which
is located at about 15 MeV above the 2p threshold, we
will not discuss it further due to a few decay events
observed from this state. Before investigating the 2p
decay properties of the 30Ar states, the states of its 1p
decay daughter nucleus 29Cl must be studied.

C. Decay energies of low-lying 29Cl states

As shown in Ref.

[12], the comparison of the θS-p
distribution obtained from the measured 28S + p double
coincidence and that from 28S + p + p triple coincidences
provide some guidance on the states in 29Cl, which were
Such a comparison is
populated in the experiment.
In the 28S + p case (the unﬁlled

histogram in Fig. 9), the 29Cl states may be populated
via several possible reactions on 31Ar, e.g., the two-step
reaction 31Ar → 30Ar + n followed by 30Ar → 29Cl + p,
or via the direct fragmentation 31Ar → 29Cl + n + p.
Concerning the θS-p spectrum obtained from the 28S+p+
p coincidence (grey-ﬁlled histogram in Fig. 9), population
of 29Cl states are presumably due to the 2p emission
from 30Ar states. Therefore, one may expect that the
θS-p peaks in both distributions indicate the possible 29Cl
states. In Fig. 9, several θS-p peaks (indicated by arrows)
with decent intensities coexist in both spectra, which
suggest the possible 29Cl resonances.

Concerning the 1p-decay energies of the 29Cl states
indicated by the arrows in Fig. 9, one can deduce their
values by employing the approximate linear relation

D. Decay schemes of 30Ar and 29Cl

As shown in Fig. 7, several states of 30Ar were
populated in the present experiment. The decay energy
of observed 30Ar states can be deduced from the ρθ
distribution shown in Fig. 7(b). The comparison of θS-p
spectrum obtained from 28S + p coincidences and that
deduced from 28S + p + p coincidences suggests several
states in 29Cl. By combining these results, we derived a
tentative level scheme together with the decay branches
for the observed 30Ar and 29Cl states.
It is shown in
Fig. 10. The g.s. and ﬁrst excited state of 30Ar and 29Cl
have been discussed in the Ref. [12]. The decay scheme
of higher excited states is interpreted below.

V. DISCUSSION

In the previous section a quite detailed energy level
and decay scheme was deduced. Such an assignment is
based on the limited kinematic information derived from
the angular distributions. The data also have limited
statistical signiﬁcance, which is a common situation for
extreme exotic nuclear systems near and beyond the

driplines. Therefore, the interpretation of the data is
partly based on some speculations, which require detailed
explanation. Our interpretation of the data is based on
reasonable arguments, which take into account present
knowledge.
It is self-consistent, no alternative self-
consistent interpretation which covers all aspects of the
observed picture is achieved. Diﬀerent issues which one
had to elaborate in order to arrive to the interpretation
shown in Fig. 10 are discussed in this section. Some of
these issues have already been considered in Ref. [12]. All
arguments are presented below in a systematic way.

A. Signature of 30Ar ground state

Identiﬁcation of the 29Cl and 30Ar g.s. energies is
the most important assignment on which the whole
interpretation is based. The low-energy peaks in the 28S-
p and 28S-p-p correlations spectra may arise from decay
channels populating the excited states of 28S
, which are
instantaneously de-excited by γ-emission. In the present
experiment the reaction target area was observed by
an ancillary γ-ray detector. With its total registration
eﬃciency of about 5%, this information could be useful
for counting rates, say, an order of the magnitude higher
than those available for 29Cl and 30Ar.

∗

The candidates for 30Ar g.s. in Fig. 7 are peak “A” at
ρθ ∼ 44 mrad (corresponding to Q2p = 1.4 MeV) and
peak “B” at ρθ ∼ 59 mrad (corresponding to Q2p = 2.45
MeV). We point to three reasons which make the peak
“B” preferable prescription for the 30Ar ground state.

The ﬁrst argument is connected with a population
cross section for the peak “A”. It comprises less than
5% of the total population intensity of all 30Ar states,
and this value is unexpectedly low for the ground state.
For comparison, one may look at some examples of

 
 
 
 
10

corresponding values obtained in the nucleon-knockout
experiments populating s-d shell nuclei beyond the
dripline. They are: ∼ 20% for 19Mg [5], ∼ 35% for 16Ne
[22], ∼ 60% for 26O [23]. These values and also other
examples, which can be found in the literature, vary
quite broadly demonstrating strong sensitivity to the
individual structure of the precursor nucleus. However,
such values never seem to be extremely small.

The second argument is connected with systematics of
odd-even energy staggering (OES) and proton correlation
pattern for the peak “A”. The OES is deﬁned as

2EOES = S(A)

2N − 2S(A−1)

N

,

2N and 2S(A−1)

where S(A)
are separation energies for two
nucleons in the system with mass number A and for one
nucleon in its A−1 subsystem. This can be interpreted as
a phenomenological paring energy value computed with
the assumption that the structure of the nuclear with
mass number A is represented by two valence nucleons
populating single-particle conﬁgurations corresponding
to A − 1 system ground state.
It was demonstrated
in Fig. 6 of Ref. [12] that the systematics of OES is
very similar for the isotone chain leading to 30Ar and
its mirror 30Mg isobar. The extrapolated value for 30Ar
is 2EOES = 2.25 MeV. However, it is known that such
a systematics breaks near the borderline of the nucleon
stability [24]. Therefore, the actually expected value of
2EOES should be a factor 0.4 − 0.7 smaller.

Several reasonable prescriptions for proton and two-
proton decay energies of 29Cl and 30Ar, respectively,
are shown in Table I. By considering the 28S-p angular
correlations in Fig. 8, the double-peak structure for the
1.4 MeV peak “A” can be interpreted as the result of the
sequential emission of two protons with the energies of
0.6 and 0.8 MeV. As far as the emission order of protons
is not known, one has to consider both prescriptions for
the 29Cl Qp value, which is marked as P1 and P2 in Table
I. Both variants provide the OES values far beyond the
range expected from systematics. Let’s assume that the
double-peak structure of the p-p correlations is actually
connected with a statistical “staggering” due to low data
statistics and in reality a single peak characteristic for
“true” 2p emission should exist. Then one should assume
the higher reasonable 29Cl g.s. position which value can
be found as Qp = 1.8 MeV from Fig. 9. For this
prescription, marked as P3, the OES value is somewhat
If one correlates the 30Ar g.s. with the
overestimated.
peak “B” in Fig. 7 (at Q2p = 2.45 MeV), and assume
Qp = 1.8 MeV (the prescription P4), then the obtained
OES value nicely ﬁts the expected range. The relative
population intensity of the peak “B” (∼ 15% of the
total) is also reasonably consistent with expectation for
the ground state. An additional argument for the choice
of Qp = 1.8 MeV prescription comes from systematics of
Coulomb displacement energies is described in the next
section.

The plausible explanation of the “A” structure at 1.4
MeV is that this is a “ﬁne-structure peak” for 2p emission

from the ﬁrst excited (probably 2+) state in 30Ar into
the ﬁrst excited state of 28S (2+ at 1.507 MeV, see Fig.
10). The further discussion of this issue needed for a
consistent description of the 29Cl and 30Ar decay schemes
(see, Fig. 10) is provided in the Sec. V D.

B. Thomas-Ehrman eﬀect in 29Cl-29Mg

If one assume the single-particle nature of the 29Cl
low-lying states, their energies can be reliably evaluated
basing on the spectrum of the isobaric mirror partner,
the 29Mg nucleus. The g.s. of 29Mg is known to have
spin-parity 3/2+ [25] and it is reasonable to assume
the single-particle d-wave structure of this state. The
ﬁrst excited state is separated just by 54 keV, see Fig.
11. According to shell model calculations with Brown-
Wildenthal USDB Hamiltonian [26], this can be expected
to be an s-wave 1/2+ state. For such a situation of
practically degenerated s- and d-wave states in 29Mg,
one may expect a strong modiﬁcation of the level scheme
due to the Thomas-Ehrman eﬀect [27, 28], which can be
evaluated by using a simple potential model.

There are two major parameters, which controls
the Coulomb displacement energies of nucleons in the
potential model: (i) the charge radius of the core nucleus,
which is a major characteristic of the charge distribution,
and (ii) the radius parameter of the potential, which
controls the nucleon orbital size. For the 28S-p channel,
the Woods-Saxon potential is used with two parameter
sets, see Table II. The ﬁrst set (P1 and P2 cases) is
quite typical for light nuclei, it was also employed in the
work on 2p radioactivity [29]. The second set (P3–P5)
uses potential parameters of a global parameterization
destined to obtain single-particle states for shell-model
calculations [30]. The charge radius of 28S is not known
but can be extrapolated using the known values for
32−36S [31], which are in the range 3.26–3.30 fm. We
consider the range rch = 3.18−3.26 fm as a realistic value
for 28S. For each nuclear potential set we use the upper
and lower charge radius values (see Table II) to deﬁne the
Coulomb potential of the homogeneously charged sphere
of radius rsp by the following expression

r2
sp = (5/3)

ch + r2
r2
(cid:2)
where rch(p) = 0.8 fm is the proton charge radius. The
obtained Qp values are in the range 1.69 − 1.79 MeV,

which is consistent with the prescription of Qp = 1.8
MeV for the peak denoted “(1)” in Fig. 9 in order to
correspond to 29Cl ground state.

One may evaluate how strongly should one modify the
potential model input to obtain Qp = 0.8 MeV or Qp =
0.6 which is required to associate the 1.4 MeV peak “A”
with the 30Ar g.s. The P5 case in Table II shows how
large should be the charge radius of 28S in order to get the
Qp value within the above-mentioned range. It is found
that a value as large as rch > 5 fm is needed. However,
charge radii as large as 5 fm become available for nuclei
heavier than neodymium and mass numbers twice larger
than that of 30Ar. Thus the decay energies Qp ∼ 0.6−0.8
MeV are unrealistic for 29Cl.

The 29Mg ground 3/2+ state and the 1.638 keV state
(which may be assumed to be 5/2+ according to shell
model calculations) belong to a d-wave doublet (it will
be shown below that the actual situation may be more
complicated, see discussion in Sec. V D). The states with
such a structure have considerably larger (∼ 0.5 MeV)
Coulomb displacement energies in comparison with the
s-wave 1/2+ state, see Fig. 10, and thus they provide
diﬀerent level ordering in 29Cl compared to 29Mg. Then
the 3/2+ prescription for peak “(2)” with Qp = 2.3 MeV,
and the 5/2+ prescription for peak “(4)” with Qp = 3.5
MeV are possible as well (see Fig. 9).

Fig. 10 shows the level scheme of 30Ar compared to
that of the isobaric mirror partner 30Mg. There is an
important diﬀerence in these schemes, which could be
an evidence for strong Thomas-Ehrman eﬀect in this
isobaric mirror pair as well. Another origin could be a
quite speciﬁc structure of the ﬁrst excited state in 30Ar,
as it is argued in Sec. V D.

C. Transition dynamics of 30Ar ground state decay

As we have shown above, the assignment of peak “B”
in Fig. 7 to 30Ar ground state is plausible from the
point of view of diﬀerent energy systematics. However,
the corresponding 28S-p angular correlations of this peak
[see Fig. 8 (b)] show the pattern which we ﬁrst found
problematic to interpret. There is neither a single narrow
“central” peak, typical for “true” 2p emission, nor a
double (or other even-number) peak structure associated
with the sequential emission of protons. Estimates of

FIG. 11: Level schemes of 29Cl and 30Ar compared with
schemes of isobaric mirror partners. Shell-model predictions
(labeled with SM USD) for 29Mg and results of a cluster
potential model (labeled with Cluster) for 29Cl are compared
with the experimental data. The energies of 29Cl are shown
relative to the 1p threshold. The energies of 29Mg states were
shifted down by 3.655 MeV in order to compare them with
the mirror states in 29Cl.

Ref. [12] demonstrated that the natural explanation of
this fact is connected with the peculiar “transitional”
decay dynamics which is exactly on the borderline
between “true” 2p and sequential 2p decay. The behavior
of physical observables in such a “transitional” region
demonstrates features analogous to phase transitions.
Namely there is a very high sensitivity of observables
to minor variations of parameters. The parameters
of nuclear decays are not subject of
free variation
from outside like in phase transitions considered e.g.
in thermodynamics. However, if our system of interest
appears to belong to “transitional” decay dynamics case,
then strong sensitivity to parameters paves the way to
precise determination of parameters (or some of their
combinations) based on observables.

Transitions between diﬀerent regimes of three-body
decays have been discussed in detail in Ref. [13]. There
exist three distinct mechanisms of such decays — “true”,
democratic, and sequential — which all are characterized
by the distinct pictures of three-body correlations and
diﬀerent systematic of the lifetimes Ref. [29]. In the most
common case the transitions between these regimes are
deﬁned by three parameters: three-body decay energy
Q2p(A), two-body decay energy of the ground state in
the core-p subsystem Qp(A − 1), and the width of the
core-p ground state resonance Γr(A − 1). Qualitative
illustration of the transition phenomenon in the three-
body systems is provided in Fig. 12.

Based on the direct-decay model which was improved
in the content of the present work, theoretical and
simulation studies of the 30Ar 2p decay dependence on
three general decay parameters have been performed in
[13]. The strong dependence of lifetime systematics in the
transition region on the parameter values is illustrated
in Fig. 13. The lifetime curves demonstrate a kink at
the transition situation. This kink is more expressed for

small values of the two-body widths. Diﬀerent curves are
evaluated based on diﬀerent assumption about proton
width of the 29Cl g.s. The gap between lifetime curves is
much larger in the true 2p decay part of the plots. This
is connected with the fact that the sequential 2p decay
width linearly depends on the 1p 29Cl g.s. width, while
the true 2p decay width depend on that quadratically.
Consequently, a stronger kink for smaller 1p width values
is needed to compensate for this eﬀect in the transition
region.

The observables, which were found of considerable
practical interest in the context of the present work, are
three-body correlations among the heavy fragment and
the protons. Fig. 14 (a) displays the calculated energy
distributions between the 28S and one of the emitted
protons.
In the calculations, the resonant energy of
29Cl g.s., Qp(29Cl) is set to 1.8 MeV and the Γ(29Cl) is
ﬁxed at 92 keV. One may clearly see that the shape and
width of the spectrum proﬁle change dramatically with
the variation of Q2p(30Ar), which represents a strong
sensitivity of the decay mechanism to the Q2p(30Ar).
In the case of small Q2p(30Ar), e.g., 2.35 MeV, the
energy distribution between 28S and proton [blue dashed
curve in Fig. 14 (a)] is mainly characterized by a bell-
like spectrum centered at ε = 0.5, which indicates the
true 2p decay.
In contrast, the spectrum with a bit
larger Q2p(30Ar) value [e.g., Q2p(30Ar) = 2.50 MeV,
the green dashed-dotted curve in Fig. 14(a)] is mainly
featured by a double-peak pattern (with two peaks at
ε = 0.75 and at ε = 0.25), which typically corresponds
to the sequential 2p emission. Therefore, the correlation
pattern is extremely sensitive to calculation parameters,
where small variations of Q2p(30Ar) cause dramatic
changes of the shapes of distributions. Similarly, the
sensitivity of the energy distribution to Γ(29Cl) was also

Fig. 14(b). Here Q2p(30Ar) = 2.45 MeV and Qp(29Cl) =
1.8 MeV. With the increase of Γ(29Cl), an obvious change
from a sequential two-body decay case to a true three-
body decay situation can be observed.

In order to compare the model predictions of the 28S-p
angular correlations with the experimental data, Monte
Carlo simulations of the detector response to the 2p
decay of 30Ar g.s. were performed. The momenta of
three decay products used in the simulations were taken
from the predictions of the direct decay model [13]. The
corresponding results are shown in panels (c) and (d) of
Fig. 14, which illustrate the dependence of the simulated
θS-p spectrum on Q2p(30Ar) and Γ(29Cl), respectively.
In comparison of experimental θS-p distribution (grey
histogram with statistical uncertainties) and various
simulations, the model prediction with Q2p = 2.45 MeV
and Γ(29Cl) = 92 keV (black solid curves in panels (c)

The sensitivity of energy distributions of decay
products to reasonable combinations of the parameters
{Q2p(30Ar), Qp(29Cl), Γr(29Cl)} was systematically
investigated in [13]. A statistical analysis allowed to
ﬁnd the preferable combination of three parameters:
Q2p(30Ar) = 2.45+0.05
−0.10 MeV and Qp(29Cl) = 1.8 ± 0.1
MeV, Γr(29Cl) = 85 ± 30 keV. The result Q2p(30Ar) =
2.45+0.05
−0.10 MeV is somewhat diﬀerent compared to the
ﬁrst-reported value Q2p(30Ar) = 2.25+0.15
−0.10 MeV from
[12], but consistent within the error bars. The
Ref.
determination of the width Γ(29Cl) in an indirect way,
based on the 30Ar correlation data, should be regarded
as a novel result of the proposed approach.

Three aspects of the current analysis should be
emphasized.
(i) The current studies were performed
based on the data with quite limited statistics. Just
fact of such opportunity is already very encouraging.
Thus they should be regarded more as a proof-of-concept
rather than a ﬁnal result. It was not evident in advance
that diﬀerences in the observed patterns would be
suﬃcient to put restrictions on the physical parameters.
(ii) It is demonstrated that the method is working
even utilizing kinematically very limited information
(angular distributions in the (heavy ion)-p channel. The
application of the method to complete kinematics where
the momenta vectors of all outgoing decay products are

13

measured, should produce results of higher precision. (iii)
To perform width measurements, standard experiments
with quite high statistics are required. For example, the
determination of Γ(29Cl) in a standard RIB experiment
on resonance scattering of 28S on a hydrogen target
would require the availability of a quite intense 28S
beam and registration of hundreds or thousands of decay
events. The sensitivity of the proposed method even for
low statistics can be understood as a result of kind of
“quantum ampliﬁcation”: the observed spectrum is not
29Cl spectrum by itself, but the result of interference of
29Cl decay amplitudes with other amplitudes involved in
30Ar decay.

D. Structure of the ﬁrst excited states in 29Cl and
30Ar

It was mentioned in Sec. V A that it could be
reasonable to assume that the 1.4 MeV “A” structure
in Fig. 8 is connected with 2p emission from the ﬁrst
excited (probably 2+) 30Ar state into the ﬁrst excited
state of 28S (2+ at 1.507 MeV, see Fig. 10). We
demonstrate in this section that such an assumption leads
to strong restrictions on the structure of the ﬁrst excited
states both in 29Cl and 30Ar as well as to a consistent
description of the decay scheme for the low-lying states
in 29Cl and 30Ar.

Within the above assumption one may associate the
whole feeding to the peak “A” with the decay sequence

30Ar(2.9) → 29Cl(2.3) → 28S(1.5) ,

(2)

while about 3/4 of the peak “C” corresponds to the
sequence

30Ar(2.9) → 29Cl(2.3) → 28S(0) .

(3)

If one compares population intensities in Fig. 8 (a) and
(c), then the sequence (3) is about 2 times more intense
than sequence (2). If one sticks to the 3/2+ prescription
for the 2.3 MeV 29Cl state then the structure of its wave
function (WF) can be schematically presented as

Ψ29Cl(3/2+) = ˜αΨ28S(0+)[d]3/2 + ˜βΨ28S(2+)[s]1/2

+ ˜γΨ28S(2+)[d]3/2 .

(4)

The estimate of the penetration factors Pl(E) provides
the ratio

Pd(2.3)
Ps(0.9)

≈ 15 − 25 .

This means that the ˜β coeﬃcient should be as large as
0.86 − 0.93. Therefore, the structure of the ﬁrst excited
state of 29Cl is totally dominated by the WF component
with the 28S subsystem in the 2+ state (the availability
of some ˜γ terms can only increase the above estimate).

Next we must check whether this assumption is
consistent with the decay scheme of 2.9 MeV state of

 
 
 
 
 
 
14

30Ar. For the decay of the ET = 2.9 MeV state there are
two branches: (i) via the 1.8 MeV g.s. of 29Cl (assumed to
be 1/2+) and (ii) via the 2.3 MeV state of 29Cl (assumed
to be 3/2+). These branches are populated with a ratio
around 3:1, see Fig. 8 (c). Let’s assume that ET = 2.9
MeV is a 2+ state. In a schematic notation the 2+ state
WF can be represented as

Ψ30Ar(2+) = αΨ28S(0+)[sd]2 + βΨ28S(0+)[d2]2
+γΨ28S(2+)[s2]0 + δΨ28S(2+)[sd]2 + ǫΨ28S(2+)[d2]2 .

The estimate of penetration factors for the most probable
decay branches provides

Pd(1.1)
Ps(0.6)

≈ 5 − 8 .

To match the observed d/s ratio around 3, one should
assume

γ2 + δ2
α2 + β2 ≈ 3,

which actually means that the weight of the excited
28S conﬁguration in the structure of the 2.9 MeV state
of 30Ar is larger than 0.75 (the decay schemes cannot
provide information about ǫ coeﬃcient). The large
weight of the excited 28S conﬁguration in the structure
of this state is also required to explain transitions to the
2.3 MeV state of 29Cl, which is dominated by the excited
28S conﬁguration as well.

The structure of the 29Cl ﬁrst excited state discussed
here seems to contradict the discussion of Sec. V B about
Thomas-Ehrman shifts: the valence nucleon can be in a
s-wave conﬁguration relative to the core (coeﬃcient ˜β) in
Eq. (4). This should produce much smaller TES values.
There may be two explanations here. One is that the
term with ˜γ is dominant in the structure of the 29Cl 3/2+.
The other point is that the s-wave component should be
much more compact in the WF (4), because the state is
more bound (due to the excitation energy of 28S 2+).

The decay of the ET = 3.4 MeV state via the 1.8 MeV
g.s. of 29Cl is dominant, while the decay path via the
2.3 MeV state is suppressed. This situation is naturally
explained by the assumption that the 0+
2 state decays via
the 1/2+ g.s. of 29Cl by the emission of a s-wave proton.
The assumption of 0+, 2+, and 0+
2 level ordering in 30Ar
is in agreement with the ordering expected from isobaric
symmetry based on the 30Mg level scheme, see Fig. 11.
All other possible prescriptions of spins and energies of
the ET = 2.9 and ET = 3.4 MeV state fail to describe the
overall situation with reasonable physics assumptions.

from the peak “D1” exhibits a triple-peak structure, in
which the middle and the right-most peaks match the
1.8 MeV (peak (1) in Fig. 9) and 2.9 MeV (peak (3) in
Fig. 9) states observed in 29Cl, respectively. Therefore, a
natural interpretation for the experimental θS-p spectrum
is the sequential proton emission of the 30Ar state “D1”
via the above-mentioned two 29Cl states. To test such
an explanation, MC simulations were performed and
the resulting θS-p spectra were compared with the data
displayed in Fig. 15(a). There the dashed and dotted
curves represent the simulations of the detector response
to the 2p decay of the 3.9 MeV 30Ar state via the 29Cl
resonances at 1.8 MeV and 2.9 MeV, respectively. The

weighted sum of these two components is shown by the
solid curve, and the contributions of the 1.8 MeV and 2.9
MeV components are 60% and 40%, respectively. One
can see that simulations with our hypothesis reproduce

the data rather well.
p angular correlations from the peak “D2” shown in
Fig. 7 were analyzed. It was found that this 30Ar state
decays by sequential 2p emission via the 29Cl states at
2.3 MeV and 2.9 MeV, respectively. Corresponding MC
simulations are shown in Fig. 15(b) and reproduce data
well.

Regarding other observed excited states of 30Ar,
namely the peaks “E”, “F1”, “F2”, and “G” shown
in Fig. 7, one can clearly see from Fig. 8 that their
28S-proton angular correlation spectra display multiple-
peak structures. For instance, the θS-p distribution
obtained from ρθ peak “E” has a triple-peak pattern,
in which the second and third peaks correspond to
the 2.9 MeV and 3.5 MeV state of 29Cl respectively.
Naturally, the decay pattern shown in the Fig. 8(e)
can be attributed to the sequential emission of protons
of one 30Ar state via the above-mentioned two 29Cl
states.
Such a hypothesis was tested by performing
MC simulations of the detector response to the decays
of this 30Ar∗ state. The input parameter of the 30Ar
state is Q2p = 5.6 MeV. The resonance energies of two
states in 29Cl are 2.9 MeV and 3.5 MeV respectively.
The branching ratios for the two above-mentioned decay
branches are 30% and 70%, respectively. The simulated
θS-p distributions are displayed by the dotted and dashed
curves in Fig. 16(a). The solid curve represents the
summed ﬁt which reproduces the data quantitatively.
Following a similar analysis of decay patterns from other
excited states in 30Ar, one may tentatively suggest that
all these excited states decay by sequential emission of
protons via intermediate resonances in 29Cl.
In order
to verify such a hypothesis, MC simulations of the
detector response to the 2p decays from these states were
performed. Fig. 16 shows a comparison between the
simulated θS-p spectra and the respective experimental
distributions. One can see that all simulations agree with
the data.

VI. SUMMARY

The present work has investigated two proton-unbound
nuclei 30Ar and 29Cl, which were identiﬁed by measuring
the trajectories of their in-ﬂight decay products 28S+p+p
and 28S + p, respectively.

For calibration purposes, the decays of the previously-
known true 2p emitter 19Mg were remeasured. The 2p

15

radioactivity of the 19Mg ground state and the sequential
emission of protons from several known excited states in
19Mg were conﬁrmed. The deduced 2p decay energies are
consistent with previous data. Evidence for a new excited
state in 19Mg at 8.9+0.8
−0.7 MeV above the 2p threshold was
found. We tentatively suggest that this new 19Mg state
decays by sequential emission of protons via two so far
unknown 18Na resonances at 2.5+0.7
−0.3 MeV and 4.0+1.5
−0.6
MeV above the 1p threshold, respectively.

Several problems relevant to the interpretation of the
data were also discussed in this work. These include:
Thomas-Ehrman shift in the states of 29Cl and 30Ar;
transition character of decay dynamics of the 30Ar g.s.
and the possibility to improve the determination of 29Cl
and 30Ar ground states properties; evidence for that the
structure of the ﬁrst excited states of 29Cl and 30Ar is
dominated by the 28S core in the 2+ state; decay schemes
of higher excited states of 30Ar.

The performed experimental studies are on the edge
of modern experimental opportunities. Because of the
limited statistics of the data, several
issues of the
corresponding nuclear structure cannot be elaborated
completely, which leaves
future
investigations.
