ARNOUX-RAUZY INTERVAL EXCHANGE TRANSFORMATIONS

PIERRE ARNOUX, JULIEN CASSAIGNE, S ´EBASTIEN FERENCZI, AND PASCAL HUBERT

ABSTRACT. The Arnoux-Rauzy systems are deﬁned in [5], both as symbolic systems on three let-
ters and exchanges of six intervals on the circle. In connection with a conjecture of S.P. Novikov,
we investigate the dynamical properties of the interval exchanges, and precise their relation with the
symbolic systems, which was known only to be a semi-conjugacy; in order to do this, we deﬁne a
new system which is an exchange of nine intervals on the line (it was described in [3] for a particular
case). Our main result is that the semi-conjugacy determines a measure-theoretic isomorphism (be-
tween the three systems) under a diophantine (sufﬁcient) condition, which is satisﬁed by almost all
Arnoux-Rauzy systems for a suitable measure; but, under another condition, the interval exchanges
are not uniquely ergodic and the isomorphism does not hold for all invariant measures; ﬁnally, we
give conditions for these interval exchanges to be weakly mixing.

Arnoux-Rauzy dynamical systems were introduced in [5] in order to generalize the fruitful triple
interaction between Sturmian sequences and rotation of the 1-torus through the Euclid continued
fraction approximation. Arnoux-Rauzy sequences are deﬁned through word-combinatorial condi-
tions, see Section 2.1 below, and have been studied from the combinatorial point of view by many
authors, see for example [13] [15] [16] [27], and many others. These sequences constitute also
the restriction to three-letter alphabets of the class of Episturmian sequences, deﬁned in [18], and
extensively studied, see the surveys [10] and [25].

The ﬁrst and foremost question on Arnoux-Rauzy sequences was to get a geometric representa-
tion of the associated symbolic dynamical system, the preferred one being as a natural coding of a
rotation of the 2-torus. The set of possible angles of this rotation is known as the Rauzy gasket, and
deﬁned in Section 2.3 below. A famous particular case, the Tribonacci sequence, was shown in [33]
to be a natural coding of a rotation of the 2-torus, and thus the corresponding system is measure-
theoretically isomorphic to that rotation. This was generalized to a larger class of Arnoux-Rauzy
systems in [4], and recently to almost all Arnoux-Rauzy systems [11], in the sense of Deﬁnition 14
below. On the other hand, [14] provides counter-examples where this isomorphism cannot hold,
see Section 5 below. For a general Arnoux-Rauzy system, one has to be content with what looks
like a second-best geometric representation built in [5], a coding of a six-interval exchange on the
circle, see Section 2.3 below; in the Tribonacci case, this is the Arnoux-Yoccoz interval exchange
[2], linked with the pseudo-Anosov map deﬁned in [7]. Note that it is still an open question to
ﬁnd other geometric models, in particular for those Arnoux-Rauzy systems which are not natural
codings of rotations of the 2-torus, see for example [34].

However, these six-interval exchanges have been recently understood to represent by themselves
a very interesting family of systems, as the dimension over the rationals of the set of lengths of
the intervals is quite smaller than the number of intervals (namely, three versus six). This kind
of interval exchanges was pointed out (in a very different context and language) by S.P. Novikov,
see [32][21][30], also [19][20][17]. This prompted several authors to make deep studies of the
Rauzy gasket in [29] (Lemma 5.9, attributed to J.-C. Yoccoz) [6] [8] [9] [26], partially solving a

conjecture of Novikov, and to look at everything that can be found about this particular family.
But indeed, a priori not much is known, as these six-interval exchanges (called AR6 in the present
paper) are only semi-conjugate to the original Arnoux-Rauzy systems (called AR3 in the present
paper): namely, an AR6 interval exchange admits a coding by a partition into three sets which is
an AR3 symbolic system, but this partition is not necessarily a generating partition, while, as far
as we know, the coding by the natural partition into six intervals of the circle cannot be built by
substitutions, contrarily to its AR3 coding. Hence no property of an AR6 interval exchange can be
directly carried out from the underlying AR3 symbolic system. Moreover, while all AR3 systems
are known to be minimal [5] and uniquely ergodic (by Boshernitzan’s result [12] using the fact
that the language complexity is 2n + 1), in stark contrast, deep geometric methods have allowed
I.A. Dynnikov and A. Skripchenko [22] to prove, again in a completely different language, the
existence of minimal non-uniquely ergodic AR6 interval exchanges.

The relation between AR6 interval exchanges and underlying AR3 symbolic systems was par-
tially tackled in [3], though only in the particular case of Tribonacci, and with a certain lack of
details: that paper deﬁnes yet another Arnoux-Rauzy interval exchange, this time on nine intervals
(called AR9 in the present paper), where an AR3 appears again as a coding by a partition into three
sets, and where the coding by the natural partition into nine intervals can be explicitly generated
by a substitution. This is the key for studying ergodic properties of AR9 interval exchanges, and
extending them to the AR6 interval exchanges which appear as factors of AR9. The one stated in
[3] is the measure-theoretic isomorphism between the three corresponding systems (AR3, AR6,
AR9) in the Tribonacci case, though no proof is offered.

In the present paper, we generalize the construction of AR9 systems to every set of parameters
in the Rauzy gasket, and their construction by substitutions, using an induction process deﬁned in
Section 3.2 below; we use them to derive dynamical properties of AR6 and AR9 systems. Our
main result is

Theorem 1. Almost every (in the sense of [11], see Deﬁnition 14 below) AR9 or AR6 interval
exchange is uniquely ergodic and measure-theoretically isomorphic to its AR3 coding.

This theorem could be deduced (using Lemma 14 below and some extra work) from the ergod-
icity of the induction process; we choose to derive it from a stronger result, namely an explicit
sufﬁcient diophantine condition (Proposition 16 and Theorem 17 below) for measure-theoretic
isomorphism between the corresponding AR9, AR6 and AR3 systems, which also implies unique
ergodicity for the AR6 and AR9. This condition is satisﬁed by almost all Arnoux-Rauzy systems
(Proposition 18 below), and many explicit examples including Tribonacci, all systems which are
periodic points under the induction, and, more generally, all the so-called Arnoux-Rauzy systems
with bounded weak partial quotients (Proposition 19 below). Thus

Corollary 2. Almost all AR9 or AR6 interval exchanges, including the Tribonacci ones and all
those with bounded weak partial quotients, are measure-theoretically isomorphic to rotations of
the 2-torus.

Thus at last we have proved the isomorphism result for the Tribonacci case; this provides the
backbone of an answer to Question 9 (asked by G. Forni) in [24] and this was another motivation
for the present paper.

Corollary 3. The Arnoux-Yoccoz interval exchange, or else the Tribonacci AR9, provide nontrivial
examples of rigid (a sequence of powers converges to the identity in L2) self-induced interval
exchanges.

Then we give a class of examples of non-uniquely ergodic AR9 (or AR6) which may be some-
what more explicit than those in [22], and give both examples and counter-examples to the isomor-
phism problem: these AR9 are measure-theoretically isomorphic to their AR3 coding if we equip
them with an ergodic invariant measure, but of course this cannot hold if we take one of the many
non-ergodic measures. Then we show that weak mixing is also present in the class of AR9 (or
AR6) systems.

1. BASIC DEFINITIONS

We look at ﬁnite words on a ﬁnite alphabet A = {1, ...k}. A word w1...wt has length |w| = t.

The concatenation of two words w and w′ is denoted by ww′.

Deﬁnition 1. A word w = w1...wt occurs at place i in a word v = v1...vs or an inﬁnite sequence
v = v1v2... if w1 = vi, ...wt = vi+t−1. We say that w is a subword of v.

Deﬁnition 2. A language L over A is a set of words. In the present paper, all languages are
assumed to be factorial (if w is in L, all its subwords are in L), and extendable (if w is in L, aw is
in L for at least one letter a of A, and wb is in L for at least one letter b of A).
A language L is minimal if for each w in L there exists n such that w occurs in each word of L of
length n.
The language L(u) of an inﬁnite sequence u is the set of its ﬁnite subwords.

Deﬁnition 3. A substitution ψ is an application from an alphabet A into the set A⋆ of ﬁnite words
on A; it extends naturally to a morphism of A⋆ for the operation of concatenation.

Deﬁnition 4. The symbolic dynamical system associated to a language L is the one-sided shift
S(x0x1x2...) = x1x2... on the subset YL of AN made with the inﬁnite sequences such that for every
t < s, xt...xs is in L.

Note that the symbolic dynamical system (XL, S) is minimal (in the usual sense, every orbit is

dense) if and only if the language L is mimimal.

Deﬁnition 5. For a dynamical system (X ′, U) and a ﬁnite partition {P1, . . . Pl} of X ′, the trajec-
tory of a point x in X ′ is the inﬁnite sequence (xn)n∈IN deﬁned by xn = i if U nx falls into Pi,
1 ≤ i ≤ l.
Then if L is the language made of all the ﬁnite subwords of all the trajectories, (YL, S) is called
the coding of (X ′, U) by the partition {P1, . . . Pl}.

2. CLASSICAL ARNOUX-RAUZY SYSTEMS

2.1. AR3 symbolic systems. These systems are the “genuine” Arnoux-Rauzy systems; we take
here as a deﬁnition their constructive characterization, derived in [5] from the original deﬁnition,
and modiﬁed in the present paper by a renaming of letters and words.

Deﬁnition 6. An AR3 symbolic system is the symbolic system on {a, b, c} generated by the three
substitutions

• σI: a → ab, b → ac, c → a,
• σII: a → ab, b → a, c → ac,
• σIII: a → a, b → ab, c → ac,

and a directing sequence rn, n ∈ N⋆, rn ∈ {I, II, III}, taking the value I inﬁnitely many times.
Namely, it is the symbolic system (Y3, S) whose language is generated by the words Ak =
σr1...σrk a, Bk = σr1...σrk b, Ck = σr1...σrk c, k ≥ 1. The respective lengths of the words Ak, Bk,
Ck will always be denoted by ha,k, hb,k, hc,k.

As mentioned in the introduction, (Y3, S) is minimal, and uniquely ergodic: there is a unique

invariant probability measure, denoted by µ.

Note that our modiﬁcation of the rules changes the usual condition of [5], that each substitution
is used inﬁnitely often, to the present condition that σI is used inﬁnitely often. The most famous
particular case is the Tribonacci system, where rn = I for all n.

2.2. Partial quotients and multiplicative rules. These quantities are deﬁned in [14], but we
redeﬁne them here as the notations are different.

Deﬁnition 7. We write the directing sequence (rn) in a unique way as k1 − 1 ≥ 0 times the symbol
III followed by one symbol I or II, then k2 − 1 ≥ 0 times III followed by one I or II etc.... the
kn ≥ 1 are then called the partial quotients of the system.
The multiplicative times are m0 = 0, mn = k1 + ...kn, n ≥ 1: they are the times m for which
rm 6= III.

Then the words Amn, Bmn, Cmn can be built by the following multiplicative rules, which could

also be expressed by substitutions but would need a countable set of them:

• if rmn+1 = I, we say that the n + 1-th multiplicative rule is a rule Im, and we have

– Amn+1 = Akn+1
– Bmn+1 = Akn+1
– Cmn+1 = Amn;

mn Bmn,
mn Cmn,

• if rmn+1 = II, we say that the n + 1-th multiplicative rule is a rule IIm, and

mn Bmn,

– Amn+1 = Akn+1
– Bmn+1 = Amn,
– Cmn+1 = Akn+1

mn Cmn.

For Tribonacci, we have kn = 1 for all n, and all multiplicative rules are Im.
We recall that in [14], we use different substitutions (called “(additive) concatenation rules” in
that paper), and the sequence of multiplicative rules (as deﬁned in that paper) corresponds to the
successive number of times we use each substitution: the n + 1-th multiplicative rule is of type 1
whenever the mn−1-th and mn+1-th substitutions are different. Then the Hn, Gn and Jn of [14] are

AR IET

5

exactly the same as respectively Amn, Bmn and Cmn in the present paper, and types 1 and 2 of [14]
correspond to our rules Im and IIm.

We shall use the inequalities proved in Lemma 7 of [14] at the multiplicative times: namely
hb,mn ≤ 2ha,mn and hc,mn ≤ 2ha,mn. These are not true in general at other (additive) times
p 6= mn.

2.3. AR6 interval exchanges. These exchanges of six intervals on a circle are deﬁned in [2] for
Tribonacci, see also [7], and [5] for the general case.

Deﬁnition 8. The Rauzy gasket Γ is the set of triples of positive real numbers (a0, b0, c0), such that,
if we deﬁne recursively the numbers an, bn, cn by taking the triple (an−1 − bn−1 − cn−1, bn−1, cn−1)
and reordering it, then for each n ≥ 0 we have an > bn > cn > 0.

Deﬁnition 9. An AR6 interval exchange (X6, T ) is deﬁned in the following way from any triple
(a0, b0, c0) in Γ: X6 is a circle of length 2a0 + 2b0 + 2c0. The circle is partitioned into three
intervals of respective lengths 2a0, 2b0, 2c0, then each one is cut into two halves; the action of
T ﬁrst exchanges by translations respectively the two intervals of length a0, the two intervals of
length b0, the two intervals of length c0, then translates everything by a0 +b0 +c.0, i.e. a half-circle.

We could also look at the same transformation as an exchange of seven intervals on the interval

[0, 2a0 + 2b0 + 2c0[, but a better model on the interval will be given in Section 3 below.

Note that he location of the origin on the circle does not change the system up to topological
conjugacy and measure-theoretic isomorphism for any invariant measure (in the sense that any
invariant measure on one of them can be carried to the other one, and the two measure-theoretic
systems are isomorphic). Similarly, the order between the intervals of lengths 2a0, 2b0, 2c0 on
the circle is not mentioned in Deﬁnition 9 (the fact that it is not always the same is somewhat
understated in [5]); by changing the origin, we can reduce the number of possible orders to two,
and the two AR6 interval exchanges deﬁned with the same (a0, b0, c0) but different orders of these
intervals are conjugate by a symmetry on the circle, thus are also topologically conjugate and
measure-theoretically isomorphic for any invariant measure.

For example, when the intervals of lengths 2a0, 2b0, 2c0 are successive intervals of the circle in
that order, T is shown in Figure 1, where on the left circle a−, a+, b−, ... denote the intervals of
length a0, a0, b0 ... while on the right circle the letters correspond to the images of these intervals
by the transformation. If in Figure 1 we choose to put the origin at the left end of the interval
denoted by a−, [0, a0) is sent to [a0 + a0 + b0 + c0, 2a0 + a0 + b0 + c0) modulo 2a0 + 2b0 + 2c0,
[a0, 2a0) is sent to [a0 + b0 + c0, a0 + a0 + b0 + c0) modulo 2a0 + 2b0 + 2c0, etc...

The link between AR3 symbolic systems and AR6 interval exchanges, studied in [5], will be
described in Section 3.4 below. But, as pointed out in the introduction, we do not know any
constructive way to build directly the language of the natural coding of the AR6 interval exchange,
that is its coding by the partition into its six intervals of continuity on the circle, coded by a−, a+,
b−, b+, c−, c+. That is why we need to introduce one more class of Arnoux-Rauzy systems.

2.4. Note on endpoints. One recurring problem when dealing with interval exchanges is what to
do with interval endpoints? A satisfying answer to this question is given by M. Keane in Section
5 of [28]: by carefully doubling the endpoints and their orbits, he deﬁnes a Cantor set on which
the transformation becomes an homeomorphism, and show this is equivalent to taking the natural
coding by the partition into deﬁning intervals. In the present paper, to make deﬁnitions easier, we
do not use Keane’s construction, and all intervals are closed on the left, open on the right; but that
will introduce technical difﬁculties, see Remark 1 below.

3. THE NEW SYSTEMS: ARNOUX-RAUZY ON NINE SYMBOLS

3.1. AR9 interval exchanges. These are deﬁned for the particular case of Tribonacci in [3]. Here
we deﬁne them in full generality, in a deliberately pedestrian way, which does not reveal how they
were devised; the grand geometry underlying and motivating the construction, generalizing the
geometry in [3], will appear in a further paper. Note that we use the same symbol T for AR9 and
AR6 interval exchanges in view of Proposition 5 below.

An AR9 interval exchange is deﬁned by a point (a0, b0, c0) in Γ, as an exchange of nine intervals

on a union of three disjoint intervals on the line.

Deﬁnition 10. For a point (a0, b0, c0) in Γ, an AR9 interval exchange (X9, T ) is deﬁned on the
union of three disjoint intervals Ω0 of length a0 + b0, Ω′
0 of length b0 + c0, Ω”0 of length a0 + c0.

An AR9 interval exchange in the ﬁrst, second or third order is deﬁned in the following way:

• in the ﬁrst order, from left to right we see Ω0, Ω′

0, Ω”0; in the second order, from left to

right we see Ω′

0, Ω”0, Ω0; in the third order, from left to right we see Ω”0, Ω0, Ω′
0,

• we partition the interval Ω0, from left to right, into four intervals of successive lengths
b0 − c0, c0, c0, a0 − c0, denoted respectively by I7,0, I8,0, I9,0, I1,0, and into four intervals of
successive lengths a0 − c0, c0, c0, b0 − c0, which we deﬁne respectively to be T I1,0, T I2,0,
T I6,0, T I7,0,

• we partition the interval Ω′

0, from left to right, into two intervals of successive lengths c0,
b0, denoted respectively by I2,0, I3,0, and into two intervals of successive lengths b0, c0,
which we deﬁne respectively to be T I5,0, T I9,0,

• we partition the interval Ω”0 from left to right, into three intervals of successive lengths
a0 − b0, b0, c0, denoted respectively by I4,0, I5,0, I6,0, and into three intervals of successive
lengths c0, b0, a0 − b0, which we deﬁne respectively to be T I8,0, T I3,0, T I4,0.

An AR9 interval exchange in the reversed ﬁrst, second or third order is deﬁned in the same way,
except that in all items above“from left to right” is replaced by “from right to left” (note that all
intervals are still closed on the left, open on the right).

It is clear from the deﬁnition that two AR9 interval exchanges deﬁned with the same (a0, b0, c0)
but different actual locations on the line of the intervals Ω0, Ω′
0, Ω”0 (equivalently, different lo-
cations of the origin and gaps between the intervals), or different orders, are conjugate by a map
which is continuous except on a ﬁnite number of points, and measure-theoretically isomorphic for
any invariant measure, in the sense of Section 2.3 above; all will be topologically isomorphic if we
suppose no two of the intervals Ω0, Ω′

0, Ω”0 are adjacent.

We could also deﬁne AR9 interval exchanges on the circle, gluing Ω0, Ω′

0, Ω”0 as in Proposition
5 below, but we prefer to deﬁne them on the line as (contrarily to the AR6 case) there is no need to
add an interval. If we choose the Ω0, Ω′
0, Ω”0 to be adjacent, and this is allowed by our deﬁnition,
we get examples of “usual” nine-interval exchanges as in [28], deﬁned on one interval; but as we
shall see below this adjacency will not be conserved by induction, so we have to use the more
general family. We shall check that all our results, in particular Lemma 11 below, which states the
adjacency of certain intervals, is true whatever the gaps between Ω0, Ω′

0, Ω”0.

For example, an AR9 interval exchange in the ﬁrst order is shown in Figure 2, where i in the
upper part corresponds to Ii,0 and i in the lower part corresponds to T Ii,0. An example in the
reversed second order is shown in Figure 3.

3.2. Induction. Now, we take an AR9 system (X9, T ); to ﬁx ideas, we suppose it is in the ﬁrst
order. Let T1 be the induced map of T on I1,0 ∪ I2,0 ∪ I3,0 ∪ I4,0. We deﬁne a1 > b1 > c1 as the
triple (a0 − b0 − c0, b0, c0) after reordering. Then there are three cases, which we tackle by growing
order of difﬁculty.

3.2.1. Induction step case III: a1 = a0 − b0 − c0.. Then b1 = b0, c1 = c0.

The situation is essentially described in Figure 4. The induction set I1,0 ∪ I2,0 ∪ I3,0 ∪ I4,0 is a
disjoint union of three intervals which we denote by Ω1, Ω′
1, Ω”1, and is further cut into nine new
intervals Ii,1, whose respective lengths are, from left to right, b1 − c1, c1, c1, a1 − c1, c1, b1, a1 − b1,
b1, c1. Then T acts on the picture as a move upwards, until we reach again the induction set, which
is marked by dashed lines. Each interval of the picture is labelled by j above if it is in Ij,0; the
labels are between parentheses for the dashed intervals, as they will not be used further (note that
T1I5,1 = T 2I5,1 is the union of a (full) subinterval of I2,0 with a (left) subinterval of I3,0, hence the
ambiguous label). Thus for example I7,1 is sent by T onto I7,0, then by another application of T
into I1,0, hence T1 = T 2 on I7,1. And we check that T1 is indeed an AR9 interval exchange deﬁned
by (a1, b1, c1) on the union of Ω1, Ω′

1, Ω”1; the order is still the ﬁrst one.

The length of each Ii,1 in Figure 5 is the same as in case III. T1 is an AR9 interval exchange

deﬁned by (a1, b1, c1), in the third order.

The length of each Ii,1 in Figure 6 is the same as in case III. T1 is an AR9 interval exchange

deﬁned by (a1, b1, c1), in the reversed second order.

The same computations work if we start from an AR9 in the second order: we get the same
pictures, in the second order in Case III, the ﬁrst order in Case I, the reversed ﬁrst order in Case
II. When we start from the third order, we get the same pictures, in the third order in Case III, the
reversed third order in Case II, and the second order in Case I. If we start form a reversed order,
just reverse the orientation of the pictures.

We can now iterate the induction: starting with T0 = T , we deﬁne Tk as the induced map of
i=1Ii,k−1, which we denote by Ja,k−1. It deﬁnes intervals Ωk, Ω′
Tk−1 on the set ∪4
k, Ω”k, Ii,k, with
∪9
i=1Ii,k = Ja,k−1. The points (ak, bk, ck) in the Rauzy gasket have been deﬁned in [5], where
the same induction process is described for AR6 interval exchanges; they constitute an algorithm
of simultaneous approximation of (a0, b0, c0), which is called the Arnoux-Rauzy algorithm. Our
induction on AR9 interval exchanges gives also an algorithm of simultaneous approximation of
(a0 + b0, b0 + c0, a0 + c0) by the lengths of the intervals Ωk, Ω′
k, Ω”k: this turns out to be the fully
substractive algorithm where the smallest of the numbers is substracted from the other two [31].

3.3. AR9 symbolic systems.

Deﬁnition 11. An AR9 symbolic system (Y9, S) is the natural coding of an AR9 interval exchange
(X9, T ), that is its coding by the partition into Ii,0, 1 ≤ i ≤ 9; we denote by ψ the map associating
to each point x ∈ X9 its trajectory in Y9.

Remark 1. Because of the way we deal with the endpoints, see Section 2.4 above, ψ is injective
but not surjective; we have Y9 = ψ(X9) ∪ D9, where D9 is a countable set made with the improper
trajectories of the right endpoints of the intervals Ii,0 and their negative orbits: these are the limits,
in the product topology of {1, ...9}IN, in which Y9 is closed, of trajectories of points approaching
these endpoints from the left, and similarly for their pre-images.

Proposition 4. For each (a0, b0, c0) in Γ, the AR9 symbolic system associated to any AR9 interval
exchange deﬁned by (a0, b0, c0) is the symbolic system on {1, ...9} generated by the three substitu-
tions

I: 1 → 35, 2 → 45, 3 → 46, 4 → 17, 5 → 18, 6 → 19, 7 → 29, 8 → 2, 9 → 3,
II: 1 → 17, 2 → 46, 3 → 45, 4 → 35, 5 → 3, 6 → 2, 7 → 1, 8 → 19, 9 → 18,
III: 1 → 1, 2 → 2, 3 → 3, 4 → 4, 5 → 45, 6 → 46, 7 → 17, 8 → 18, 9 → 19.
and a directing sequence rn, n ∈ N⋆, rn ∈ {I, II, III}, deﬁned by rn = I if an = an−1 − bn−1 −
cn−1, rn = II if bn = an−1 − bn−1 − cn−1, rn = III if cn = an−1 − bn−1 − cn−1; rn takes the value
I inﬁnitely many times.

Any system deﬁned in this way is an AR9 symbolic system.

Proof

We iterate the induction of Section 3.2, and call ik, 1 ≤ i ≤ 9, the trajectory under T of any point
x in Ii,k between the time 0 and the ﬁrst return time of x in Ja,k−1, coded by the partition into
Ii,k, 1 ≤ i ≤ 9. The induction steps show that ik = σ′
rk i, and that, if we iterate the induction
inﬁnitely many times, the words 1k to 9k, k ≥ 0, generate the language of T . As an > bn > cn > 0,
rn = I inﬁnitely often.

It is actually proved in [5] that the construction of rn gives a one-to-one correspondence be-
tween the points of Γ and the sequences rn, n ∈ N⋆, rn ∈ {I, II, III} where rn takes the value I
(cid:3)
inﬁnitely many times, which proves our last assertion.

Thus the AR9 symbolic system does not depend on the location or the order of the intervals Ω0,
0, Ω”0. The common length of the words 1k, 2k, 3k, 4k, is ha,k deﬁned in Section 2.1, hb,k is the

Ω′
common length of the words 5k, 6k, 7k, hc,k the common length of the words 8k, 9k.

The multiplicative rules of Section 2.2 above extend immediately to AR9 systems, in the fol-

lowing way

3.4. Relations between Arnoux-Rauzy systems. Starting from a point (a0, b0, c0) in Γ, we have
deﬁned two geometric systems, (X9, T ) and (X6, T ).

Proposition 5. An AR9 interval exchange deﬁned by (a0, b0, c0) is conjugate to an AR6 interval
exchange deﬁned by (a0, b0, c0) by a map which is continuous except on a ﬁnite number of points,
and thus gives a measure-theoretic isomorphism for each invariant measure, and any AR6 interval
exchange is conjugate to an AR9 in this way.

Proof

By gluing together the three intervals Ω0, Ω′
6 sending X9 to a circle of
length 2a0 + 2b0 + 2c0: for example, in the ﬁrst order, we identify the right end of Ω0 with the left
end of Ω′
0 with the left end of Ω′”0, the right end of Ω”0 with the left end of Ω0.
This conjugates (X9, T ) to a system (X6, T ) which is exactly the AR6 interval exchange deﬁned in
Section 2.3 above: its intervals of continuity are the φ′
6(Jj,0), j ∈ {a−, a+, b−, b+, c−, c+} where
Ja−,0 = I1,0 ∪ I2,0, Ja+,0 = I3,0 ∪ I4,0, Jb−,0 = I5,0, Jb+,0 = I6,0 ∪ I7,0, Jc−,0 = I8,0, Jc+,0 = I9,0. It

0, Ω”0 we deﬁne a map φ′

0, the right end of Ω′

is immediate that every AR6 interval exchange can be built in this way.

AR IET

(cid:3)

As in Proposition 4, any point in Γ deﬁnes a directing sequence (rn). Each directing sequence

deﬁnes two symbolic systems, (Y9, S) and (Y3, S).

Proposition 6. The coding of an AR9 symbolic system deﬁned by (a0, b0, c0), by the partition into
three sets Ja,0 = I1,0 ∪ I2,0 ∪ I3,0 ∪ I4,0, Jb,0 = I5,0 ∪ I6,0 ∪ I7,0, Jc,0 = I8,0 ∪ I9,0, is the AR3
symbolic system deﬁned by the directing sequence in Proposition 4, and all AR3 symbolic systems
can be built in this way.

Proof

We deﬁne the letter-to-letter map φ by φ(1) = φ(2) = φ(3) = φ(4) = a, φ(5) = φ(6) = φ(7) = b,
φ(8) = φ(9) = c. If we build the words Ak, Bk, Ck in Deﬁnition 6 with a directing sequence (rn)
and the words 1k to 9k in the proof of Proposition 4, we get inductively that for all k, φ(1k) =
φ(2k) = φ(3k) = φ(4k) = Ak, φ(5k) = φ(6k) = φ(7k) = Bk, φ(8k) = φ(9k) = Ck. By the
induction steps of Section 3.2, Ak, resp. Bk, resp. Ck are the trajectory, under the coding by the
partition into three sets, of any point x in Ii,k, 1 ≤ i ≤ 4, resp. 5 ≤ i ≤ 7, resp. 8 ≤ i ≤ 9, between
the time 0 and the ﬁrst return time of x in Ja,k−1, and the words Ak, Bk, Ck, k ≥ 0, generate the
language of T .

The last assertion comes again from the fact, known from [5], that each directing sequence de-
(cid:3)

ﬁnes a point in Γ.

FIGURE 7. The ﬁve AR systems

Corollary 7. An AR9 symbolic system has an AR3 symbolic system deﬁned by the same directing
sequence as a factor, and all AR3 symbolic systems can be built in this way.

Proof

These are two codings of the same AR9 interval exchange, and the partition into nine intervals is

12

ﬁner than the partition into three sets.

(cid:3)

The map associating to a point in (X9, S) its coding in (Y3, S) is just φψ, where ψ is deﬁned in
Deﬁnition 11 and φ in the proof of Proposition 6. As in Remark 1, we have φψ(X9) = Y3 \ D′
3
for the countable set D′
3 ⊂ D3 where D3 = φ(D9).
φψ conjugates the map T on X9 with the shift S on X3: to use the vocabulary of [5], φψ is called
a semi-conjugacy; as is pointed out in the introduction above, this does not give a one-to-one cor-
respondence between points. Similarly, φ conjugates the shifts on Y9 on Y3 and φ(Y9) = Y3; it is
also a semi-conjugacy, and not injective, see Proposition 13 below.

3 made with improper trajectories; note that D′

We can also deﬁne the AR6 symbolic system (Y6, S) on {a−, a+, b−, b+, c−, c+}, as the natural
coding ψ6, of (X6, T ), by its six intervals of continuity; we have Y6 = ψ6(X6) ∪ D6 for a countable
set D6. We can write φ = φ3 ◦ φ6, with φ6(1) = φ6(2) = a−, φ6(3) = φ6(4) = a+, φ6(5) = b−,
φ6(6) = φ6(7) = b+, φ6(8) = c−, φ6(9) = c+, and φ3(j−) = φ3(j+) = j for j = a, b, c.

In the same way as Proposition 6, we could reprove the main result of [5]: the coding of an
AR6 interval exchange deﬁned by (a0, b0, c0), by the partition into three sets φ′
6(Ja−,0 ∪ Ja+,0),
6(Jb−,0 ∪ Jb+,0), φ′
φ′
6(Jc−,0 ∪ Jc+,0), is the AR3 symbolic system deﬁned by the directing sequence
of Proposition 4, and all AR3 symbolic systems can be built in this way. Thus (Y6, S) appears as
an intermediate coding between the AR3 and AR9 symbolic systems; because of Proposition 5, φ6,
applied letter to letter, is invertible except on a countable set (included in φ6(D9)), and conjugates
(Y9, S) and (Y6, S), which are thus measure-theoretically isomorphic for each invariant measure.
In Figure 7, the four systems linked by full edges are, for all our purposes, the same system; the

nature of the dashed edges will be investigated in the remainder of this paper.

As was already mentioned, we do not know any way to build the trajectories in Y6 as in Deﬁni-
tion 6 or Proposition 4; but they can be deduced from the trajectories in Y9 by applying φ6 letter to
letter, and that was the main objective of the theory of AR9 systems; however, in general it will be
easier to work directly on AR9 systems and then derive the properties of AR6 systems.

At this stage, it may be useful to recall the various notations we use, for which we had to make
choices because of the number of systems we have deﬁned and some long pre-existing notations:
a, b, c are always the three symbols on which AR3 systems are built. But ak, bk, ck, for any k, are
real numbers, describing lengths of intervals. Ak, Bk, Ck are the words used to build AR3 systems,
of lengths (i.e. number of letters) ha,k, hb,k, hc,k. 1 to 9 are the symbols on which AR9 symbolic
systems are built, 1k to 9k are the words used to build them, their lengths are among ha,k, hb,k,
hc,k. Interval lengths for AR9 systems, when needed, are deﬁned in terms of ak, bk, ck. Roman
numerals are used to number substitutions and rules to build words.

4. DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES

4.1. Minimality. By using the condition that rn = I for inﬁnitely many n, the minimality of AR3
symbolic systems and AR6 interval exchanges is shown in [5]. The minimality of AR6 symbolic
systems follows, as the minimality of an interval exchange is equivalent to the minimality of its
natural coding, small intervals corresponding to small cylinders.

Proposition 8. Any AR9 system is minimal.

Proof

We show it for the symbolic systems, the minimality of the interval exchanges follows from the

AR IET

13

remark just above. We want to show that in the language of (Y9, S) any word w occurs in any long
enough word. It is enough to show that for all n and 1 ≤ i ≤ 9 there exists N such that in occurs
in every jN , 1 ≤ j ≤ 9.

For example we take i = 1. Through σ′

III in occurs in in+1 for all i, as we are after sufﬁcient
conditions we can ignore these rules. We start from 1n; it occurs in 1n+1 through any number of
III, so we wait until the ﬁrst σ′

I (we know it exists), in which 1p1 occurs in 4p1+1, 5p1+1, 6p1+1.

We follow these three words until just before the next σ′

track 4p2, 5p2, 6p2; if there has been one σ′
occur are 2p2, 3p2, 4p2; if there have been two σ′
So in the worst case we have to track either 2p2, 3p2, 4p2 or 4p2, 5p2, 6p2. After the σ′

4.2. Rokhlin towers.

Deﬁnition 12. In a system (X ′, U), a Rokhlin tower is a collection of disjoint measurable sets F ,
UF , . . . , U h−1F (U jF is called level j of the tower, F is called the base, h the height of the tower).
A slice of τ is a union of whole levels U p1F ... U plF , and a column of τ is a union of all sublevels
G, ... U h−1G for a subset G of F . We shall usually write “the tower τ ” as a shortened form of
“the tower for which the union of the levels is the set τ ”.

Proposition 9. In an AR9 interval exchange (X9, T ), there are nine sequences of towers τi,k,
respectively of base Ii,k, and height equal to the length of the word ik, 1 ≤ i ≤ 9, k ≥ 0: the union
of all the levels for ﬁxed k is X9, and every point x in X9 is determined by the sequence ι(x, k),
η(x, k) such that x is in T η(x,k)Iι(x,k),k, k ≥ 0. This remains true if we restrict k to a subsequence,
for example the mn. All levels of these towers are intervals.

Proof

From the induction steps in Section 3.2, we deduce that the τi,k are indeed Rokhlin towers, whose
union of levels for ﬁxed k is indeed X9; all these levels are intervals and their lengths are smaller
(cid:3)
than ak, which tends to zero when k goes to inﬁnity, hence the result.

Figures 4, 5, 6 going from stage 0 to stage 1 show how the towers at order 1 are made from
the towers at order 0 by cutting and stacking. This cutting and stacking is done in the same way

14

P. ARNOUX, J. CASSAIGNE, S. FERENCZI, AND P. HUBERT

from stage k to stage k + 1; it is dictated by the induction as above, and can be read on the rules
giving the words 1k+1 to 9k+1 as concatenations of the words 1k to 9k, which are deduced from the
substitutions σ′
I is applied, and we deduce from 1 → 35
that 1k+1 = 3k5k, and the tower τ1,k+1 is made by a column of τ5,k stacked above a column of τ3,k.

III: for example, when rk+1 = I, σ′

I to σ′

Corollary 10. In (Y9, S), the τ ′
i,k = ψ(τi,k), i = 1, ...9, form nine sequences of Rokhlin towers. If
D9 is the countable set deﬁned in Remark 1, every point y in Y9 \D9 is determined by the sequences
ι(y, k), η(y, k) such that y is in Sη(x,k)ψ(Iι(x,k),k), k ≥ 0.

In (X9, T ), there exist three sequences of Rokhlin towers τa,k, τb,k, τc,k, respectively of bases
Ja,k, Jb,k, Jc,k, and heights equal to ha,k, hb,k, hc,k, k ≥ 0, where Ja,k = I1,k ∪ I2,k ∪ I3,k ∪ I4,k,
Jb,k = I5,k ∪ I6,k ∪ I7,k, Jc,k = I8,k ∪ I9,k. The union of all their levels for ﬁxed k is X9.

In the AR3 system (Y3, S), the τ ′

j,k = φψ(τj,k), j = a, b, c, form three sequences of Rokhlin
towers; if D3 = φ(D9), every point x in Y3 \ D3 is determined by the sequences ι′(y, k), η(y, k)
such that y is in Sη(y,k)φψ(Jι′(y,k),k), k ≥ 0.

Proof

The ﬁrst assertion comes from Proposition 9 translated by ψ to the symbolic system, the second
one from the deﬁnition of the Jj,k and the values of the heights, the third one from the ﬁrst one
and the fact that for all k φ sends ψ(Ii,k) to ψ(Ja,k) if i = 1, 2, 3, 4, ψ(Jb,k) if i = 5, 6, 7, ψ(Jc,k)
(cid:3)
ifi = 8, 9. and similarly for the other levels.

Remark 2. We can also build directly (slightly) enlarged versions of the various towers τ ′ in the
symbolic systems: this is done in [14] for the τ ′
j,k, j = a, b, c, by induction on cylinders which are
the closure of φψ(Ja,k) in the topology of the symbolic systems, and can be done in the same way
for the τ ′
i,k, i = 1, ...9, by induction on unions of cylinders which are the closure of ψ(Ja,k). These
enlarged towers are closed and include also improper trajectories; but we do not need that for our
results, for which countable sets can be neglected, and in any case points of D3 must be taken into
account, see Remark 3 below.

The towers τ ′

i,k, i = 1, ...9, can be built by cutting and stacking with the same rules as the τi,k.
The τj,k or τ ′
j,k, j = a, b, c, can be built by cutting and stacking, using the concatenation rules
generating the words Ak to Ck, deduced from the substitutions σI to σIII; we shall also use the
multiplicative rules to build more quickly these towers at multiplicative times, as is shown in Fig-
ures 9 and 10 below.

Lemma 11. For every k, the sets T jI2,k and T jI3,k, 0 ≤ j ≤ ha,k − 1, resp. T jI5,k and T ji6,k,
0 ≤ j ≤ hb,k − 1, resp. T jI8,k and T ji9,k, 0 ≤ j ≤ hc,k − 1, are adjacent intervals.

Proof

We make the induction hypothesis that our result is true at order k and that T jI2,k, T jI5,k, r T jI8,k
are the leftmost of the respective two adjacent intervals when Tk is not in a reversed order, the
rightmost if Tk is in a reversed order.

This is true for k = 0, whatever the order. The induction step from k to k + 1 describes also the

way the towers at order k + 1 are built from the towers at order k.

Take for example Case I when Tk is not in a reversed order: the new tower 8 is made by taking
a right subinterval of the base I2,k of the old tower 2, and keeping the corresponding part of all

AR IET

15

the levels of the old tower 2; the new tower 9 is made by taking a left subinterval of the base I3,k
of the old tower 3, and keeping the corresponding part of all the levels of the old tower 3. Thus
all corresponding levels of the new towers 8 and 9 are adjacent as those of the old towers 2 and 3
were, and the levels of the new tower 8 are to the left of those of the new tower 9.
The new tower 2 is made by taking a left subinterval of the base I4,k of the old tower 4, and keeping
the corresponding part of all the levels of the old tower 4, until the top; above that we stack a right
subinterval of I5,k, and the corresponding part of all the levels of the old tower 5. The new tower 3
is made by taking a right subinterval of I4,k, and keeping the corresponding part of all the levels of
the old tower 4, until the top; above that we stack I6,k, and all the levels of the old tower 6. Thus
all corresponding levels of the new towers 2 and 3 are adjacent as those of the old towers 5 and 6
were, while the levels of the old tower 4 are intervals, and the levels of the new tower 2 are to the
left of those of the new tower 3.
The new tower 6 is made by taking a right subinterval of I1,k, and keeping the corresponding part
of all the levels of the old tower 1, until the top; above that we stack a left subinterval of I9,k, and
the corresponding part of all the levels of the old tower 9. The new tower 5 is made by taking a
subinterval of I1,k just left of the previous one, and keeping the corresponding part of all the levels
of the old tower 1, until the top; above that we stack the subinterval I8,k, and all the levels of the
old tower 8. Thus all corresponding levels of the new towers 5 and 6 are adjacent as those of the
old towers 8 and 9 were, while the levels of the old tower 1 are intervals, and the levels of the new
tower 5 are to the left of those of the new tower 6.

The other cases are similar.

FIGURE 8. Rokhlin towers in X9

An immediate consequence is best seen on Figure 8:

Corollary 12. Each level of the towers τc,k is an interval, each level of the towers τb,k is a union
of at most two intervals, each level of the towers τa,k is a union of at most three intervals.

Note that the Jj,k and their images are not intervals for j = a, b, except maybe for the ﬁrst values
0, Ω”0, but even in that case, for example if they are in the ﬁrst

of k, with some choices of Ω0, Ω′

order, Jb,0 is not an interval. Similarly, except maybe for the ﬁrst values of k, the levels of the
towers τb,k are not intervals, the levels of the towers τa,k are not unions of less than three intervals.

4.3. Isomorphism.

Deﬁnition 13. For i = 1, 2, 3, let Ei ⊂ Y3 be the set of points which have i pre-images under φ.
Proposition 13. Y3 \ D3 ⊂ E1 ∪ E2 ∪ E3. E3 is countable. If µ(E1) < 1, then for any invariant
probability µ′ the system (Y9, S, µ′) is a two-point extension of (Y3, S, µ)

Proof

The knowledge of a point y in Y3 determines the sequences ι′(y, k) in {a, b, c} and 0 ≤ η(y, k) ≤
hι′(y,k),k − 1 such that y is in Sη(y,k)φψJι′(y,k),k for all k. Except if y is in D3, there exist points
in x ∈ X9 such that φψ(x) = y, and the pre-images of y by φ are the points ψ(x); because of
the way φψ acts on the towers, all these x must be in T η(y,k)Iι(x,k),k were ι′(y, k) = φ(ι(x, k)). y
being ﬁxed, for a given k, all possible x are in at most three of the intervals of Figure 8 above: if
ι′(y, k) = a, all possible x are either in T η(y,k)I1,k, or in T η(y,k)I2,k ∪ T η(y,k)I3,k, or in T η(y,k)I4,k,
and similarly there are only two possible intervals if ι′(y, k) = b, and one if ι′(y, k) = c. If there
exist more than three such points x, two of them must be inﬁnitely often in the same interval, thus
must be the same as the intersection of inﬁnitely many of these intervals deﬁnes at most one point.
Thus we get our ﬁrst assertion.

c,k ∪ τ ′

By the same reasoning, if y ∈ Y3 \ D3 is in τ ′

b,k for inﬁnitely many k, then y is in E1 ∪ E2.
Thus if y is in E3 \ D3, y is in τ ′
a,k for all k ≥ k0. By the rules of construction by cutting and
stacking, this implies that for all k ≥ k0 η(y, k) takes the same value η0, thus any pre-image of y
by φψ is in ∩k≥k0T η0Ja,k. For η0 = 0, it is shown in [5] that this intersection consists indeed of
three distinct points, whose images by ψ are not in D6 and which have the same images by φψ,
thus E3 \ D3 consists of the union of the positive orbits of these three points, which proves our
second assertion.

Thus µ(E1 ∪ E2) = 1, and if µ(E1) < 1 the number of pre-images by φ is two on a set of
(cid:3)

positive measure, thus almost everywhere by ergodicity, and this is our third assertion.

Lemma 14. Let y be in Y3 \ D3. If y is in τ ′

c,k for inﬁnitely many k, then y is in E1.

Proof

Under the hypothesis, as in the proof of Proposition 13, for inﬁnitely many k all the pre-images of
y by φψ are in an interval, of length ck, thus the intersection of inﬁnitely many of these intervals
(cid:3)
deﬁnes at most one point.

Remark 3. If we enlarge the towers to cover all Y3 as in [14] and Remark 2 above, the generaliza-
tion of Lemma 14 does not hold for y ∈ D3: indeed, the point x0 separating I8,0 from I9,0 deﬁnes
one trajectory in ψ(X9) and one improper trajectory (as in Remark 1), and both these trajectories
have the same image y0 by φ, though we can check that, for example in the Tribonacci case, y0 is
in the enlarged τ ′
c,k for inﬁnitely many k. However, it is true that every point in Y3 has at most three
pre-images by φ, as the only candidates to have more are the points which are in the enlarged τ ′
a,k
for all k ≥ k0, and their pre-images do not give rise to improper trajectories.

At this stage, one can ask whether the condition to be in τ ′

c,k for inﬁnitely many k is necessary
for y to be in E1. Hopefully, a necessary and sufﬁcient condition will be given in a further paper,
but the following lemma gives already a negative answer for many systems including Tribonacci.

Q

We turn now to the isomorphism problem: as E3 is nonempty, the best we can hope is to replace

the semi-conjugacies in Section 3.4 by measure-theoretic isomorphisms.

Theorem 17. Under the hypothesis of Proposition 16, an AR9 or AR6 symbolic system or interval
exchange is uniquely ergodic and measure-theoretically isomorphic to its AR3 coding.

Proof

Then, by Proposition 16 and Lemma 14 φ is invertible almost everywhere. Thus φ provides a
measure-theoretic isomorphism between (Y3, S, µ) and (Y9, S, µ′) for any normalized invariant
measure µ′. Such an invariant measure µ′ can be deﬁned also on (X9, T ) as ψ is invertible almost
everywhere, and ψ provides a measure-theoretic isomorphism between (X9, T, µ′) and (Y9, S, µ′).

20

P. ARNOUX, J. CASSAIGNE, S. FERENCZI, AND P. HUBERT

In particular, any such measure µ′ has to be ergodic, hence the unique ergodicity. The results ex-
(cid:3)
tend then to the intermediate coding (Y6, S, µ′) and to its geometric model (X6, T, µ′).

Deﬁnition 14. As in [11], we consider measures on all inﬁnite sequences of symbols I, II, III
and take any shift invariant ergodic probability measure ν which assigns positive measure to each
cylinder; by identifying an AR3, AR6, or AR9 system with its deﬁning sequence (rn), we can deﬁne
ν on the set of all AR3, AR6, or AR9 systems.

In particular, one of these measures coincides with the measure of maximal entropy for the

suspension ﬂow of the Rauzy gasket built in [8], see also [9].

Proposition 18. The hypothesis of Proposition 16 is satisﬁed by ν-almost every AR3, AR6, or AR9
system.

Proof

This hypothesis is satisﬁed in particular if for inﬁnitely many n we have kn+1 = 2 and kn+2 = 1,
which is satisﬁed in particular if for inﬁnitely many p we have rp = I, rp+1 = rp+2 = III,
rp+3 = rp+4 = I. As this cylinder has positive measure and ν is ergodic, this is true for ν-almost
(cid:3)
every sequence (rn).

This completes the proof of Theorem 1 above. But the sufﬁcient condition in Proposition 16
gives also the isomorphism (and unique ergodicity) for many explicit examples; while the ﬁrst set
of values of ξn is enough to prove Proposition 18 above, with the help of the second set of values
we can prove the following.

Proposition 19. The hypothesis of Proposition 16 is satisﬁed by all Arnoux-Rauzy systems where
the kn are bounded (in [11] these are said to have bounded weak partial quotients).

Proof

If the n + 2-th multiplicative rule is Im, then ξn is either

This completes the proof of Corollary 2 above; then Corollary 3 is proved by using the measure-
theoretic isomorphism between the Tribonacci AR3 and a rotation of the 2-torus [33] and the fact
that such a rotation is always rigid.

4.4. Non unique ergodicity.

Theorem 20. If
< +∞, each corresponding AR9 or AR6 symbolic system or interval
exchange is not uniquely ergodic; it has two ergodic invariant measures; it is measure-theoretically
isomorphic to its AR3 coding if and only if it is equipped with an ergodic measure.

Thus, the condition

< +∞ implies that for any invariant measure µ′, the system
(Y9, S, µ′) is such that µ′-almost every point y in Y9 is determined by the sequences ι”(y, k), η(y, k)
ι”(y,k),k, ι”(y, k) ∈ {1, 4}. We say that (Y9, S, µ′) is
such that y is in level η(y, k) of the tower τ ′
generated by two sequences of towers, and such a measure-theoretic system is said to be a system
of rank (at most) two; by a classical result for which we refer the reader to [23], (Y9, S), which is
of rank at most two for any invariant measure, has as at most two ergodic invariant measures.

At multiplicative times, we deﬁne recursively (τ ′

As is explained in more details in [1], we can build an application φ1 from ¯X to Y9 by sending
the j-th level of the tower ¯τ ′
: it is consistent, deﬁned almost
everywhere and one-to-one. By taking the image of ¯µ by φ1, we build a measure-theoretic isomor-
phism between the rank one system ( ¯X, ¯T , ¯µ) and (Y9, S) equipped with some invariant probability
measure µ1; µ1 is ergodic as ¯µ is. We do the same for another application φ4, which sends the j-th

a,mn.
These towers are built in the same way as the ¯τ ′
a,mn by spacers does
not change the system, thus as in [1] (Y3, S, , µ) is measure-theoretically isomorphic to ( ¯X, ¯T , ¯µ),
thus to both (Y9, S, µ1) and (Y9, S, µ4); but it cannot be measure-theoretically isomorphic to a
non-ergodic (Y9, S, µ′). And the same reasoning holds for the others AR9 or AR6 systems consid-

Note that in the only family of counter-examples we have, the two-point extension of Proposition
13 is rather degenerate, being ergodic only when the measure is concentrated on one copy of the
factor.

5. WEAK MIXING
Deﬁnition 15. If (X ′, U, µ0) is a ﬁnite measure-preserving dynamical system, a real number
0 ≤ θ < 1 is a measurable eigenvalue (denoted additively) if there exists a non-constant f in
L1(X ′, R/Z) such that f ◦ U = f + θ (in L1(X ′, R/Z)); f is then an eigenfunction for the eigen-
value θ.

As constants are not eigenfunctions, θ = 0 is not an eigenvalue if U is ergodic.
(X ′, U, µ0) is weakly mixing if it has no measurable eigenvalue.

The existence of weak mixing for AR3 systems, proved in [14], came as a surprise; this existence
persists for AR9 (and AR6) systems, because under the hypothesis
< +∞, by Theorem
20 above the AR9 or AR6 system equipped with one of its ergodic measures is isomorphic to its
AR3 coding, while by Theorem 2 of [14] this AR3 system is weakly mixing. The sufﬁcient condi-
< +∞:
tion given in [14] for weak mixing of AR3 systems is weaker than the condition
we shall show now that under this sufﬁcient conditions the AR9 systems are also weakly mixing,
for any ergodic invariant measure. But indeed this raises more questions than gives answers, as we
shall see in the discussion below.

Proof

a,mn+1, we arrive at the same level in τ ′

The only difference between the present proof and the proof in [14] is in the beginning. Namely,
to prove Proposition 10 of [14], we use the fact that when we move by Sha,mn inside a substantial
slice of τ ′
a,mn; here we need the stronger result that for all
i = 1, 2, 3, 4, when we move by Sha,mn inside a substantial slice of τ ′
i,mn+1, we arrive at the same
level in some τ ′
j,mn. This in turn involves some technical difﬁculties when kn+1 is small, obligeing
us to use our hypotheses on the kn at that stage, which was not recessary in [14]. Thus Proposition
10 of [14] is replaced by

Lemma 22. If θ is a measurable eigenvalue for an AR9 symbolic system (Y9, S, µ′) satisfying
the hypotheses of Proposition 21, kn+1||ha,mnθ|| → 0 when n → +∞, where ||
|| denotes the
distance to the nearest integer.

Proof

Let f be an eigenfunction for the eigenvalue θ; for each ε > 0 there exists N(ε) such that for all
||f − fn||dµ < ε and is constant on each level of each
n > N(ε) there exists fn, which satisﬁes

We continue exactly as in [14]. Let ε < 1

let i be the smallest 0 ≤ j ≤ kn+1 such that ||jθha,mn|| 6= j||θha,mn||, then i ≥ 2 and ||(i −
1)θha,mn|| = (i−1)||θha,mn||, thus i||θha,mn|| = (i−1)||θha,mn||+||θha,mn|| = ||(i−1)θha,mn||+
||θha,mn|| < 400ε < 1

get kn+1||θhn−1|| < 200ε for n > N(ε).

Suppose now kn+1 = 2; then, except maybe for a ﬁnite number of values of n, the hypotheses
imply that the n-the multiplicative rule is IIm. Note also that we need only to prove ||θha,mn|| <
Cε. For concatenation rules such as 1mn+1 = 12
mn7mn, we see that S iterated by the length of 1mn,
namely ha,mn, sends to itself each level of τ ′
1,mn if we start from the ﬁrst slice τ ′
1,mn+1,
whose height is comparable (by some constant) to the height of τ ′
1,mn+1, thus we can write the
reasoning which leads to ||θha,mn||µ′(τ ′
If there is no square in the concatenation rule, its right member is 3mn4mn5mn, which is equal to
mn−15mn−13mn−14kn−1
4kn
mn−15mn−13mn−1; if kn ≥ 2 we iterate S by the length of 4kn
mn−15mn−1, which is
ha,mn, starting from the 4kn−1
mn−1; if kn = 1 we use the length of 3mn−15mn−1,
which is ha,mn, starting from the ﬁrst 3mn−1. In both cases, the iteration of S by the chosen quan-
tity will send levels of some τ ′
i,mn−1 to themselves, thus our choice of fn allows to write the usual
reasoning, and to complete the case kn+1 = 2.

Suppose kn+1 = kn = 1.Then, again for n large enough, the n-th and n − 1-th multiplica-
tive rules are IIm. The concatenations we look for are 1mn7mn = 1mn−17mn−11mn−1, 4mn5mn =
3mn−15mn−13mn−1, 3mn5mn = 4mn−15mn−13mn−1,4mn6mn = 3mn−15mn−12mn−1, In the ﬁrst one,

ha,mn, which is the length of 1mn−17mn−1, can be used to iterate S starting from the ﬁrst 1mn−1, and
similarly in the second one. The last ones are equal to 3mn−24kn−1−1
mn−25mn−2 and
4kn−1−

mn−2 5mn−23mn−24kn−1

Suppose kn+1 = 1 but kn ≥ 2. Then ha,mn = ha,mn+1 − ha,mn−1. We have ||θha,mn−1|| < Cε
because kn ≥ 2, and ||θha,mn+1|| < Cε either because kn+2 ≥ 2 or because kn+1 = kn+2 = 1, thus
(cid:3)
we conclude.

Then the (nontrivial) Sections 3 and 4 of [14] prove that, under the hypotheses of Proposition
21, the condition kn+1||ha,mnθ|| → 0 gives no possible θ except θ = 0, which is excluded because
of the ergodicity of the system. The same reasoning applies to the other AR9 or AR6 systems. (cid:3)

We do not know whether this sufﬁcient condition gives interesting new examples; it might help
to ﬁnd a weakly mixing AR9 system for which µ(E1) = 1 in the AR3 coding, but this we were not
able to achieve. Indeed, starting from Lemma 14 as in Section 4.3, we are able to build such AR9
systems under the condition
may be ﬁnite; we could also get
= +∞. while
these conditions by starting from Lemma 15 and imitating the proof of Proposition 16; this falls
short of being compatible with the conditions of Proposition 21. Indeed, we conjecture that these
conditions are not compatible with µ(E1) = 1, and not even with unique ergodicity; whether these
conditions are necessary for weak mixing is not known either. It would be also very interesting to
ﬁnd a uniquely ergodic weakly mixing AR9, or a weakly mixing AR9 which is not isomorphic to
its AR3 coding.
