Abstract: 

The images of sunspots in sixteen active regions taken at the UCCI Observatory in Grand 

Cayman during June - November 2015, were used to determine their fractal dimensions using 

the perimeter-area method for the umbral and the penumbral region. Scale free fractal 

dimensions of 2.09 ± 0.42  and 1.72 ± 0.4 were found respectively. This value was higher 

than the value determined by Chumak and Chumak (1996) who used a similar method but for 

the penumbral region only for their sample set. There is a positive correlation r = 0.58 

between umbral and the penumbral fractal dimensions for the specific sunspots. Furthermore, 

a time series analysis was done similarly on eight images of AR 12403, from 21st August 

2015 – 28th August 2015 taken from the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD). The 

correlation r = 0.623 between the umbral and penumbral fractal dimensions in the time series 

indicating that the complexity in morphology indicated by the fractal dimension between the 

umbra and penumbra followed each other in time as well.

1. Introduction: 

Fractals were popularised by Mandelbrot (1983) and since then have become very useful 

tools for the quantification of irregular shapes and dynamical phenomena in nature. The wide 

range of their applications include use in diverse fields such as examining the growth of 

cancer cells (Losa, 2012) to the behaviour of stock exchanges (Panas 2001). Their 

applications are extensive and Morse (1985) even applied the use of fractals on vegetation 

and the body sizes of insects that can live on it. They found that very tiny insects occupy 

those with high fractal values or complexity.  Practical applications of fractal dimensions 

have aided in determining the measure of toughness as a function of roughness in concrete 

(Issa et al., 2003). Wherever, there is evidence of irregular and complex patterns in nature 

that may be static, it has been a useful tool, but its use also extends to dynamical phenomena. 

Fractals can help determine if a system has turbulence and is chaotic (Mazzi and Vassilicos, 

2004). Bershadskii (1990) showed that large scale fractal structure in laboratory turbulence, 

the ocean and the clustering of galaxies can have a common percolation nature which can be 

approximated by the fractal dimension of the order of about 4/3.  

When it comes to understanding solar phenomena, it is understood that solar magnetic 

activity lies at the heart of many solar features that are observed which include faculae, 

sunspots, solar flares, prominences and coronal mass ejections. It is modelled by dynamic 

chaotic system (Lawrence et al., 1995; Bofetta et al., 1999). The appearance, growth and 

disappearance of sunspots have been found to be connected to variations in the magnetic field 

of the Sun (Solanki, 2003). It has been shown by Deng et al. (2016a) that there are 

relationships between number of faculae, sunspot counts and sunspot areas and solar flare 

activity. Therefore, the behavior of any single phenomena is related to the behaviour of the 

other features as they share a common underlying magnetic dynamo process driving them.  

The physical distribution of such features on the solar disk is also not random, nor 

2 

 
symmetrical between northern and southern solar hemispheres. Deng et al. (2016a, 2016b) 

suggest that the nonlinear coupling of the polar magnetic fields with strong active-region 

fields produces the complexity and the relationships between the polar faculae and sunspot 

numbers and areas. They used a time series to investigate the fractal and chaotic properties of 

high and low-latitude solar activity by use of the fractal dimension, Hurst exponent and 

Lyapunov exponent and thereby were able to establish a predictability timescales in years for 

these three measures. They determined values of the fractal dimension as approximately 1.2 

and the Hurst exponent of approximately 0.8 showed long range persistence (Deng et al. 

2016a). The fractal dimension for sunspots determined at a point in time differs from the 

value determined through time series, that is, spatial and temporal determinations yield 

different values (Georgoulis 2005).  In this paper, we determine the scale-free fractal 

dimension d, from images of spatially distributed active regions.  

Deng (2016c) further analyzes the magnetic complexity and multi-fractal  behavior of solar 

Hα flare activity and finds that there is a long range correlation due to the multi-fractal 

behaviour and that the solar flare activity is most irregular in the northern hemisphere 

compared to elsewhere in the solar disk. Solar flares and sunspot activity has been strongly 

correlated (Yan and Qu 2007; Yan et al. 2009) as the stored magnetic energy in active 

regions suddenly gets released as kinetic energy of the particles, radiation and plasma flow 

and heat (Fletcher et al., 2011). The process of the transformation of the stored energy in the 

active region to solar flares however is not well understood. It is therefore important to 

understand the fractal behavior of solar flares as well to gain an insight into active regions on 

the Sun. The findings by Deng (2016c) on the solar flares follow the non symmetrical 

behavior of active regions in the different hemispheres of the Sun and is consistent with it. 

3 

 
 
Deng et al. (2016b) have also investigated constraints for the solar dynamo models by 

investigating the hemispheric interconnection of solar activity phenomena for sunspot areas 

during Solar Cycless 9 – 24. They note that sunspot areas are suitable indicators of solar 

magnetic activity as well as giving an insight into the growth and decay of sunspots (Feng et 

al., 2014).  They found that the sunspot areas have greater physical significance than the 

sunspot numbers since there is a linear relationship between sunspot areas and its total 

magnetic fluxes (Preminger and Walton 2006).  It is noted that sunspot areas as a measure of 

solar magnetic activity are more suitable than sunspot numbers because there are challenges 

in the measurement and identification of the smallest spots (de Toma et al., 2013). The study 

in this paper uses area-perimeter relationship to determine the fractal dimension.  

The monthly sunspot group numbers have been found to vary for the northern and southern 

hemispheres of the solar disk (Deng et al., 2013) over different eras.  The monthly sunspot 

group numbers in the northern hemisphere preceded those in the southern hemisphere during 

1874-1927, with a subsequent shift to the southern hemisphere leading the northern 

hemisphere during 1928-1964 and Deng et al. (2013) note that currently we are in the phase 

where the monthly sunspot numbers in the northern hemisphere lead the southern hemisphere 

counts. Therefore in any study with sunspots, it is important to highlight their location. The 

periodicity of solar activity in both hemispheres have not been found to be identical (Deng et 

al., 2014). Our sunspot sample can be classified as being located in the low-latitude band 

from -18.4 to 17.2 degrees latitude. 

Qin (1994) performed a fractal study on sunspot relative numbers and determined a fractal 

dimension D = 2.8 ± 0.1 using data from January 1850 to May 1992. This study was extended 

by Qin (1996) who employed fractal dimensions to assist in prediction of monthly sunspot 

numbers using the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. Greenkorn (2009) examined the 

nonlinear analysis of the daily sunspot number for each of cycles 10 to 23 to determine if the 

4 

 
convective turbulence was stochastic or chaotic. He found that there was stochastic behaviour 

for cycles 10 to 19, transitioning to chaotic behaviour for cycles 20, 21, 22, and 23, having 

implication for the scale of turbulence. However, Price et al. (1992) found that using raw 

monthly sunspot number data for a 22 year period (monthly mean Wolf sunspot numbers), 

shows no evidence that the sunspot numbers are generated by a low-dimensional 

deterministic nonlinear process.   More recently, Gayathri and Selvaraj (2010) also used 

sunspot numbers as a measure of solar activity using fractals. For the period 1990 to 2004, 

they found that the average fractal dimension for periods of 10 days or less was around 1.43 

but changed to 1.72 for periods longer than 10 days. Shenshi et al. (1999) analyzed the 

dynamic behaviour for the monthly mean variations of the sunspot relative number from 

January 1891 to December 1996 and found a fractal dimension of 3.3 ± 0.2. This is the 

highest fractal dimension encountered in such studies to date. Fractals application to sunspot 

numbers have been one of the most common application of this tool to solar activity. 

Watari (1995) studied the fractal dimensions of solar activity temporally using daily solar 

indices like the sunspot number, 10.7 cm radio flux, coronal emission and the total solar 

irradiance from the NIMBUS-7/ERB (Earth Radiation Budget). The author found that the 

solar activity varies more irregularly for time scales that are longer than several days and 

shorter than several months and, that the yearly values of the fractal dimension did not 

change in concert with the Solar Cycle. 

Zelenyi and Milovanov (1991) also presented a fractal model of sunspots obtaining 

expressions for the magnetic field distributions in sunspot umbrae and penumbrae. The model 

allowed a qualitatively explanation for the process of sunspot formation and, the morphology 

of spots with developed penumbras with the fractal dimension being 1.24 for developed 

sunspots.  

5 

 
Implication of turbulent structure by use of fractal analysis to sunspots was studied by 

Chumak and Chumak (1996) where they determined the fractal dimension of the solar 

sunspot umbra using cross-section area – outline length method which we have used.  They 

found a value for the fractal dimension 1.35 which corresponded to turbulent structure in 

percolation theory.  Chumak and Zhang (2003) further explored the question of whether total 

sunspot area and the total magnetic flux were proportional to each in ten solar Active 

Regions. While they found that some of the relationships satisfied simple power laws, no 

single power law for the area-flux correlation was common to all the Active Regions. Thus 

fractal examination showed that what some of the power laws found could not be justified 

inside the simple models of stationary magnetic flux tube aggregation. Chumak (2005) 

extended the study to include self-similar and self-affine structures on the sunspots and their 

magnetic fields. Solar X-ray flux was also studied and could be represented as well by fractal 

dimension.  

In this paper we have followed the analysis of Chumak and Chumak (1996) but, applied it to 

the umbral as well as the penumbral region as well.  Fractals can help to determine the nature 

of the sunspot morphology and in so doing can perhaps help in predicting their evolution 

from the stage of their formation to their disappearance. Much of the recent work has focused 

on the time series analysis to determine the multifractal dimension (Vertyagina and 

Kovslovskiy, 2013) while this paper focuses on the complexity of the actual structure of two 

aspects of the sunspots, the umbra and penumbra as possible indicators of its evolution. It has 

not been common practice to consider both the umbra and penumbra in studies of active 

regions. Since such features are dynamical phenomena and the morphology can clearly define 

these aspects common to most sunspots, it can be an indicator of its evolution. We also 

present some preliminary results on using this same method to determine the evolution of the 

fractal dimension temporally for both the umbral and penumbral regions for a set of eight 

6 

 
images of AR 12403, from 21st August 2015 – 28th August 2015 obtained from the Debrecen 

Photoheliographic Data (DPD). 

The paper is divided as follows. In Section 2, the detail of the digital solar imaging for the 

images used from University College of Cayman Islands (UCCI) Observatory is given.  In 

Section 3 we report on the data used. Section 4 reports on the results and analysis on the data. 

In Section 5, we discuss our findings and conclude in Section 6.  

2. Digital Solar Imaging: 

Although the UCCI Observatory has a dedicated 8” Solar Newtonian, the images used in this 

study were captured with a TS 115mm APO triplet refractor equipped with a 3x’s TeleVue 

Barlow, Baader Herschel wedge, Baader Solar Continuum filter (540nm bandpass) and 

IR/UV cut filter.   Digital imaging devices included both the monochrome DMK41 (1280 × 

960 pixels of 4.65um) and ZWO ASI120MM (1280 × 960 pixels of 3.75um).  SharpCap 2.6 

was used for capture software in which 300 frames were captured as an AVI file.  Stacking 

was carried out with AutoStakkert2 software where 15% of the ranked best frames were 

stacked.  This process improves SNR and, the threshold is adjustable.  For the next level of 

processing, we used Registax 6 which provided a very effective “wavelet” function which 

improves image quality further.  Finally, for photo editing, we used PaintShop Pro 7 for the 

addition of false color and adjustment of brightness/contrast.  Magnification was not an issue 

since the parameters to be measured were ratios rather than absolute. 

The measurement of the area and perimeter were determined using ImageJ1. It offers multiple 

graphics and analytical tools of which two allow for rapid and accurate measurement of area

and perimeter of a defined entity.  The threshold is adjustable based on adjacent pixel 

gradients.   

3. Data: 

The image set contained 16 ARs taken between 16th June 2015 and 3rd November 2015. The 

images were inspected to ensure only good images were used. Good images were defined by 

two criteria (Solanki 2003). 

i. 

Images must have been taken when the ARs were near the centre of the solar disc so 

as to avoid distortions caused by the Wilson Effect. 

ii. 

Images must contain the highest level of contrast available.  

For this study the area and perimeter of the sunspot umbra and penumbra in each 

active region were determined. Active regions were defined as clusters of sunspots and 

pores which were clearly connected and given an official number by NOAA2. For each 

AR, measurements were only taken for well-defined sunspots containing a clear umbra 

and penumbra. Pores which do not contain a penumbra were not included in the 

measurements. All measurements were done using the ImageJ software. The wand 

(tracing) tool was used to outline the umbrae (as seen in Figures 1b, 2b, and 3b) after 

which the measure tool was used to determine the areas and perimeters. The area is 

determined by counting all the pixels within the enclosed area while the perimeter 

counts the pixels used to form the outline. This was also done outlining the penumbrae

as seen in Figures 1c, 2c and 3c. It should be noted that the penumbra outline enclosed 

both the umbra and penumbra. In active regions which contained multiple spots, all the 

spots containing a clear umbra and penumbra were outlined and measured as one 

entity. 

Figures 1a to 3a show examples of some of the images used. Figures 1b to 3b show how the 

umbra was selected and Figures 1c to 3c show the selection of the penumbra respectively.

4.  Results and Analysis: 

To determine the fractal dimensions of the sunspot’s umbrae and penumbrae, the area-

perimeter relation as defined by Chumak and Chumak (1996) was used. 

The area of the sunspot umbra/penumbra, S, is related to the perimeter of the sunspot 

umbra/penumbra, L, as follows: 

𝑆 ~ 𝐿𝑞, 

𝑞 =

𝐿𝑜𝑔 𝑆

𝐿𝑜𝑔 𝐿

, 

𝑑 =

2

𝑞

, 

q is related to the fractal dimension, d,  

if the area is fractally dependant on the perimeter.  

Table 1 gives the measurements for the umbrae and penumbrae of the sunspots in the 16 

Active Regions selected for analysis with the timing and date of data acquisition as well as 

the latitude where that was available.

A preliminary time series analysis was done on eight consecutive days following the same 

active region, which was emerging, through its disc passage. This data set comprises of eight 

images of AR 12403, from 21st August 2015 – 28th August 2015. The images are taken from 

the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) (Baranyi, Győri, and Ludmány 2016) and is 

given in Table 3. As can be seen in Figure 7, the central meridian passage occurs 

approximately in the middle of the period analyzed. The period is also done for eight 

days around the central meridian passage to ensure that distortion due to limb effects 

do not affect the data used.

From Fig 7, it is found that there is a correlation coefficient r = 0.623 between the fractal 

dimension for the corresponding umbra and penumbra with time. 

5. Discussion 

As noted in the Introduction, fractal dimensions are very useful in a variety of dynamic and 

chaotic phenomena. While their importance in describing features associated with magnetic 

activity on the Sun such as faculae, sunspot numbers, coronal mass ejections and 

prominences has been highlighted, it is important to distinguish how the use and 

determination of fractal dimensions in this study varies from other uses of fractal dimensions 

24 

 
 
 
 
for similar phenomena in other studies. Broadly, fractal dimensions can be used to quantify 

structure at a point in time or over a time i.e. spatially or temporally. This study has focused 

on the structure of sunspots spatially, similar to the analysis from Chumak and Chumak 

(1996) and unlike the studies by Deng et al.  (2016c) which focused on the time series 

variations.  Uritsky and Davila (2012) however studied the spatio-temporal evolution of 

unipolar and bipolar photospheric regions to analyze the fractal dimensions’ multiscale 

behavior. Furthermore, fractal dimensions have also been determined for the distribution in 

the number of sunspots appearing on the solar disk (Deng, 2016a) showed that there is a 

correlation among the different measures of fractal dimensions of number of sunspots and 

time series determinations. These different determinations quantify the phenomena they 

measure which behave fractally and therefore obey a power law. Therefore, the distribution 

of sunspots, their temporal evolution, and their morphology all have shown fractal nature. 

This clearly indicates that magnetic activity giving rise to all of these determinations would 

be a scaling dynamical chaotic process. We used the correlation fractal dimension for our 

study with q = 2 which is widely used in studying morphology and is the scale free fractal 

dimension. This correlation dimension can be considered an empirical proxy for the 

correlation integral which yields the embedding dimension. Generalized correlation 

dimensions determines the multifractal nature within which the embedding dimension gives a 

measure of the correlation between different sets. Any discrepancies between these 

dimensions is therefore a measure of the clustering behavior (Uritsky and Davila 2012).  

We applied the methodology of Chumak and Chumak (1996) to our 16 active regions in 

white-light, and we obtained a value for the penumbral fractal dimension of 1.72 ± 0.4, 

higher than their penumbral value of 1.35.  We further determined the fractal dimension for 

the umbral region as well. This yielded a value of 2.09 ± 0.42. This indicates that the 

complexity of the structure within the umbral region is higher than that in the penumbral 

25 

 
region.  This can have implications as to how sunspots evolve.  However, for such a study, 

the same spot has to be monitored over a period of time which is the current study underway 

by the authors. We report some preliminary results on this. For AR 12403, for a period of 

eight days from 21 – 28 August 2015, the sunspot image from Debrecen Solar Observatory 

(DSO) was used to determine its umbral and penumbral fractal dimension. While this is 

preliminary result, it is interesting that umbral fractal dimensions are consistently higher than 

the penumbral values and also that they follow each other. There is a correlation coefficient 

between them of r = 0.623. 

It is important to consider the effect of the resolution on the determination of the scale free 

fractal dimension. Was it possible that the difference in our findings could be due to the 

difference in the quality of the images as it is one of the features of fractals that the dimension 

can change with greater detail at the same scaling? However, the authors were unable to 

analyze the images of sunspots used in the study by Chumak and Chumak (1996).  To test the 

effect of resolution, as a comparison, we computed the value of the fractal dimension for the 

unprocessed images from the UCCI Observatory used in this analysis and corresponding 

sunspot images obtained from the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) (Baranyi, Győri, 

and Ludmány 2016). The resolution of the latter is reported to be as 1 arcsecond 

(Stanford.edu 2010). For the imaging system at the UCCI Observatory, we estimate the 

resolving power from the Dawe’s limit as 1.01 arcsec while the diffraction limited resolution 

is 11.82 arcsec. The Table 4 below shows the 11 active regions used for this analysis on the 

impact on the fractal dimension of the resolution.  The corresponding fractal dimensions from 

the three different datasets for a subset of 11 ARs that were available for the three different 

datasets is shown in Table 5.

Table 5.  Fractal dimensions, d determined for the three data sets with different spatial 

resolutions. 

Table 5 shows that the fractal dimension is not very sensitive to spatial resolution for the 

active regions. This is consistent with the findings of Georgoulis (2012) who determined that 

the multiscale parameters of active regions depended sensitively on resolution and 

observational characteristics rather than the scale free fractal dimension, which is what we 

have investigated. They determined this by utilizing three distinctly different spatial 

resolutions of the magnetograms with linear pixel sizes being 0.158 arcsec (highest 

resolution), 0.605 arcsec, and 1.98 arcsec (lowest resolution) to determine the fractal and 

multifractal dimension. They found that for 1.98 arcsec resolution the fractal dimension was 

1.41, and for 0.605 arcsec it was 1.43 and the highest resolution yielded 1.54, all within error 

margins to be considered similar to our findings. Georgoulis (2012) notes that the values of 

the scale-free fractal dimension d, are fairly consistent, despite the widely different spatial 

resolution and the different instruments.  He suggests that the reason for this might be fractal 

dimension qualitatively highlights the morphological complexity of the studied self-similar 

structure that is being reflected adequately on seeing-free (Hinode SOT/SP and SOHO/MDI) 

magnetograms largely regardless of spatial resolution and magnetic flux content. 

An interesting study which yielded similar fractal dimensions as our study in a single system 

was reported by Weitz et al. (1985) on the limits of the fractal dimension for irreversible 

kinetic aggregation of gold colloids. While gold colloids seem to have nothing in common 

with sunspots, the former deals with the kinetic growth processes resulting in clusters.  It is 

therefore possible that there may be similar kinetic growth processes leading to similar 

morphology for both aggregates and sunspots. As our images show, a perfectly spherical 

isolated sunspot is an extremely rare event compared to what can be generated by computer 

28 

 
 
models (Rempel, 2011). The actual sunspot images appear quite similar on visual inspection 

to aggregates in the gold colloids. While Weitz et al. (1985) applied the fractal analysis to 

aqueous colloid systems, it is possible that the fluid dynamics of compressible flow dealing 

with the formation of the sunspots could be similar.  

While there are several ways to determine the fractal dimension of a geometrical structure, it 

should be noted that the method used by Weitz et al. (1985) for the determination of the 

fractal dimension was through the determination of interparticle interactions and mass as a 

function of radius. The values they obtained indicate whether there is dominance of diffusion-

limited kinetics or reaction-limited kinetics. This they controlled by the addition of pyridine 

to the gold colloids. By analogy, is it possible that the umbral and penumbral values of the 

fractal dimensions are reflective of similar processes occurring? Obviously the penumbral 

region is larger than the umbral region for a sunspot, and interestingly, the study on the gold 

colloids found that the diffusion-limited kinetics yields a larger cluster aggregate than the 

reaction-limited kinetics. The slow aggregation process yields the value of fractal dimension 

of 2.01, for E > kT when determined from the mass of the clusters as a function of their 

radius. The diffusion-limited aggregates were determined to have a fractal value of 1.77, for 

E << kT, with both regimes being described by power laws.   

By extension of the analogy to the results of this study, it is possible that the formation of the 

umbra and penumbra depend on energy and therefore temperature dynamics, however, on the 

macroscopic scale it should be noted that the darker regions of the umbra represent cooler 

temperatures than the brighter regions such as the penumbra.  The penumbra represents the 

transition of the temperature gradient to the ambient temperature of the solar surface and the 

end of the region of influence of magnetic activity contained within the active region. 

29 

 
Recent models of the sunspot formation, for example, Jaegglie (2012), hypothesized that 

ionized hydrogen becomes molecular hydrogen due to the reduced temperature in a sunspot, 

due to the trapping by the magnetic fields. We propose that the gold colloid analysis can be 

used as an analog model, since the addition of pyridine serves to displace the charged ions 

from the surface of the colloid even as the ionized hydrogen becomes molecular hydrogen 

according to Jaegglie (2012). 

7. Conclusions 

We have determined that the umbral and penumbral regions of the sunspots have different 

fractal dimensions from the analysis of sunspots in 16 active regions using the method of 

Chumak and Chumak (1996).  Our value is higher than the fractal dimension they determined 

for the penumbra. We have extended our study to include the umbra as well. Our values 

match well with the findings of a totally unconnected study on the fractal dimension of gold 

aggregates (Weitz et al., 1985) and therefore we propose that the kinetic dynamics in the 

colloid system may be related to similar processes of compressible flow in the sunspot thus 

leading to similar morphology of these unrelated structures. Preliminary studies of the change 

of the fractal dimension for the umbra and penumbra temporally found that they are 

correlated and can indicate that the changes in complexity between the umbra and penumbra 

are linked.
