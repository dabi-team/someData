ABSTRACT

We have analyzed FUSE, COS, GHRS, and Keck HIRES spectra of the UV-bright star Barnard 29 in
M13 (NGC 6205). By comparing the photospheric abundances derived from multiple ionization states
of C, N, O, Si, and S, we infer an eﬀective temperature Teﬀ = 21, 400 ± 400 K. Balmer-line ﬁts yield a
surface gravity log g = 3.10±0.03. We derive photospheric abundances of He, C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, S,
Cl, Ar, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ge. Barnard 29 exhibits an abundance pattern typical of the ﬁrst-generation
(FG) stars in M13, enhanced in oxygen and depleted in aluminum. An underabundance of C and an
overabundance of N suggest that the star experienced nonconvective mixing on the RGB. We see no
evidence of signiﬁcant chemical evolution since the star left the RGB; in particular, it did not undergo
third dredge-up. Previous workers found that the star’s FUV spectra yield an iron abundance about
0.5 dex lower than its optical spectrum, but the iron abundances derived from all of our spectra are
consistent with the cluster value. We attribute this diﬀerence to our use of model atmospheres without
microturbulence, which is ruled out by careful ﬁts to optical absorption features. We derive a mass
M∗/M(cid:12) = 0.45 − 0.55 and luminosity log L∗/L(cid:12) = 3.26 − 3.35. Comparison with stellar-evolution
models suggests that Barnard 29 evolved from a ZAHB star of mass M∗/M(cid:12) between 0.50 and 0.55,
near the boundary between the extreme and blue horizontal branches.

1. INTRODUCTION

The bright, blue star Barnard 29 in Messier 13 (NGC
6205) has intrigued astronomers for more than a cen-
tury. In a series of papers, Barnard (1900, 1909, 1914)
pointed out that some of the cluster’s stars “shine with
a much bluer light than the great majority” and cited
Barnard 29 as the “most striking example” of this
group. Smith (2005) reviews the early research into
these hot, luminous objects, which are now referred to
as UV-bright stars. Some are post-AGB stars, evolving
from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) to the white-
dwarf cooling curve at high luminosity; others are AGB-
manqu´e stars, evolving directly from the extreme hori-
zontal branch (EHB) at lower luminosity. Modern spec-
troscopic studies of Barnard 29 include those of Conlon
et al. (1994), Dixon & Hurwitz (1998), Moehler et al.
(1998), and Thompson et al. (2007). They established

the star as a post-AGB object with Teﬀ = 20, 000 ± 1000
K, log g = 2.95±0.1, and log N (He)/N (H) = −1.06±0.20
and determined its photospheric abundances of C, N, O,
Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe. Its radial velocity (VLSR = −228
km s−1; Thompson et al. 2007) is consistent with the
cluster mean (VLSR = −228.0 km s−1; Harris 1996,
2010).

Despite over a century of study, important questions
about Barnard 29 remain unanswered. In particular, the
iron abundance derived from the star’s far-ultraviolet
(FUV) spectrum is roughly 0.5 dex lower than that de-
rived from optical data, which is consistent with the
cluster mean (Thompson et al. 2007). Another ques-
tion concerns the extent to which the star’s photospheric
abundances have been altered by evolutionary processes,
particularly nucleosynthesis on the AGB. The availabil-
ity of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise FUV and op-
tical spectra allow us to conﬁrm the star’s iron abun-
dance and determine the abundances of many additional
species. We employ archival spectra from the Far Ultra-
violet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), the Cosmic Ori-
gins Spectrograph (COS) and Goddard High Resolution

eter (HIRES). A summary of these data is presented in
Table 1. A link to the FUSE and HST data is provided
here: 10.17909/T9ZH6R.

In Section 2, we describe these observations and our
reduction of the data. We present our determination
of the star’s eﬀective temperature and chemical abun-
dances in Section 3.1 and its surface gravity and helium
abundance in Section 3.2. We describe our model at-
mospheres in Section 3.3 and our ﬁtting procedure in
Section 3.4. We discuss challenges presented by speciﬁc
stellar features in Section 4.1 and examine the implica-
tions of our photospheric abundances in Section 4.2. We
estimate the star’s mass, radius, and luminosity in Sec-
tion 4.3 and discuss its evolutionary status in Section
4.4. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section 5.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

2.1. FUSE Spectroscopy

The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)
provides medium-resolution spectroscopy from 1187 ˚A
to the Lyman limit (Moos et al. 2000; Sahnow et al.
2000). Barnard 29 was observed through the FUSE
30(cid:48)(cid:48) × 30(cid:48)(cid:48) aperture. The data were reduced using v3.2.1
of CalFUSE, the standard data-reduction pipeline soft-
ware (Dixon et al. 2007). CalFUSE corrects for a variety
of instrumental eﬀects, extracts spectra from each of the
four FUSE channels, and performs wavelength and ﬂux
calibration. The extracted spectra are binned by 0.013
˚A, which corresponds to about 2 detector pixels, or one-
fourth of a point-source resolution element. The spectra
from each exposure are aligned by cross-correlating on
the positions of stellar absorption features and combined
into a single spectrum for each channel. The signal-to-
noise ratio (S/N) per resolution element is about 20 at
wavelengths shorter than 1000 ˚A and about 30 at longer
wavelengths. The spectrum shows absorption from C,
N, O, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ge.

Lehner et al. (2004) used this spectrum in a survey
designed to study the rate of radiative cooling in the dif-
fuse interstellar medium (ISM). They combined column-
density measurements of C II*, S II, P II, and Fe II with
H I 21 cm emission measurements to derive the cool-
ing rates and analyze the ionization structure, depletion,
and metallicity of low-, intermediate-, and high-velocity
clouds (LVCs, IVCs, and HVCs) along a number of high-
latitude sight lines.

2.2. COS Spectroscopy

The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) enables
high-sensitivity, medium- and low-resolution spec-

troscopy in the 1150–3200 ˚A wavelength range (Green
et al. 2012). Barnard 29 was observed with COS us-
ing both the G130M and G160M gratings. The fully-
reduced spectra, processed with CALCOS version 3.2.1
(Fox 2015), were retrieved from the Mikulski Archive
for Space Telescopes (MAST). The S/N varies between
45 and 65 per 7-pixel resolution element in the G130M
spectrum. In the G160M spectrum, the S/N falls mono-
tonically from ∼ 60 at 1430 ˚A to ∼ 20 at 1770 ˚A. The
spectrum shows absorption from He, C, N, O, Mg, Al,
Si, S, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ge.

The G160M exposures were obtained ﬁrst, in time-
tag mode, followed by a pair of G130M exposures. Be-
cause the star is bright at short wavelengths, the G130M
exposures were obtained in ACCUM mode, which can
accommodate higher count rates. The use of ACCUM
mode had two eﬀects on the data: First, the resolution
of the G130M spectrum is signiﬁcantly lower than the
nominal value for this grating (R ∼ 18, 000); modeling
the line-spread function with a Gaussian yields FWHM
= 0.13 ˚A (R ∼ 10, 000). The motion of the COS Optics
Select Mechanism 1 (OSM1), which is used to switch
between gratings, is not perfectly controlled and can
continue throughout an exposure, which in turn moves
the spectrum across the detector in an eﬀect known as
OSM drift (White et al. 2016). Time-tag data can be
corrected for OSM drift (CALCOS does this automat-
ically), but ACCUM data cannot, resulting in a lower
spectral resolution for the G130M spectrum.

The second eﬀect is an error in the wavelength so-
lution for the ﬁrst G130M exposure. The spectra pro-
duced by the two exposures are nearly identical on de-
tector segment B (1130 – 1280 ˚A), but are oﬀset by
about 6 pixels at the short-wavelength end of segment
A (1290 – 1430 ˚A) and by more than 40 pixels – nearly
0.5 ˚A – at the long-wavelength end. When taking data
in ACCUM mode, COS follows each external exposure
with a short exposure of a wavelength-calibration lamp;
perhaps the ﬁrst cal-lamp spectrum was distorted by
OSM drift. We correct for the wavelength error by de-
termining the shift between the two spectra in 10 ˚A bins
across segment A, ﬁtting a linear function to the mea-
sured oﬀsets, and rescaling the wavelength array of the
ﬁrst exposure. Rather than combining the two spectra,
we feed both of them to our ﬁtting routines and ﬁt them
simultaneously.

Welsh et al. (2011) used the COS and FUSE spectra to
study the ISM toward M13. They detected absorption
due to C I, C II, C II*, C IV, N I, N II, N V, O I, Al II,
Si II, Si IV, S II, and Fe II at VLSR ∼ −60 km s−1,
associated with a well-known IVC, and absorption due
to C II, C III, C IV, N II, Si II, and Si IV at VLSR =

has been analyzed by both Moehler et al. (1998) and
Thompson et al. (2007), who treat the jump in diﬀerent
ways. Moehler et al. assume that it is instrumental.
They deﬁne the continuum “by eye” and remove it in
their normalization of the spectrum. Thompson et al.
assume that the jump is astrophysical and employ mod-
els with a sloping continuum. Fig. 3 of Thompson et al.
shows that the jump is present in the GHRS spectra of
both Barnard 29 and ROA 5701, which were observed
using the same instrumental set up. We conclude that
the jump is instrumental and follow Moehler et al. in re-
moving it. Our estimate of the continuum is overplotted
in Fig. 1.

2.4. Keck Spectroscopy

Barnard 29 was observed using the HIRES echelle
spectrograph on the Keck I telescope (Vogt et al. 1994).
The spectrograph was conﬁgured to use the red cross-
disperser and a slit of width 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)861 and length 7.(cid:48)(cid:48)0. We
retrieved the resulting spectrum from the Keck Obser-
vatory Archive (KOA). The standard KOA extraction
provides one-dimensional spectra that are ﬂat-ﬁelded,
bias and background subtracted, and wavelength cali-
brated. The spectrum ranges from 4288 to 6630 ˚A and
is divided into 30 spectral orders that cover 70 ˚A on
average. At wavelengths longer than 5200 ˚A, there are
gaps between the spectral orders that increase in size
from a few ˚Angstroms to about 25 ˚A as the wavelength
increases. The S/N within a 0.1 ˚A resolution element
varies from about 100 to 150 across each spectral order.
The He I λ5875 line is not used in the spectral analysis,
because it lies at the edge of spectral order 23. Besides
H I and He I, the Keck spectrum exhibits features of
N II, O II, Mg II, Al III, Si II, Si III, S II, Ar II, and
Fe III. The full list of spectral features and their equiv-
alent widths is presented in Table 2.

The orders of an echelle spectrum have a distinctive
shape, which we must remove before attempting to ﬁt
individual features. For each order, we model the con-
tinuum using the interactive Python tool specnorm.py.

−121 ± 3 km s−1, which they identiﬁed as a previously
unknown highly-ionized, multi-phase HVC.

2.3. GHRS Spectroscopy

The Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS)
was one of the four original axial instruments aboard the
Hubble Space Telescope (Heap et al. 1995). Barnard 29
was observed through the Large Science Aperture (LSA)
with the G200M grating. The fully-reduced spectrum,
a product of the ﬁnal re-calibration of the GHRS data
set, was retrieved from MAST. The spectrum, repro-
duced in Fig. 1, spans the wavelength range 1865–1905
˚A, a bandpass chosen to enable a measurement of the
star’s iron abundance (Moehler et al. 1998). Accord-
ing to version 6.0 of the GHRS Instrument Handbook
(Soderblom et al. 1995), the resolution of the G200M
grating is R = 20, 000 at 1900 ˚A, so we model the line-
spread function with a Gaussian of FHWM = 0.095 ˚A.
The S/N is about 30 per resolution element across the
bandpass.

The GHRS spectrum of Barnard 29 shows consider-
able structure, with a jump in the continuum level be-
tween about 1877 and 1885 ˚A (Fig. 1). The spectrum

The user identiﬁes spectral regions free of absorption
features to which the program ﬁts a third-order spline
function. The technique does not work for the orders
that contain hydrogen Balmer lines, as they are so deep
and wide that it is impossible to reconstruct the un-
derlying continuum. We therefore modify the routine,
enabling it to read, write, and manipulate the spline
functions. For Hα and Hβ, we instruct the program
to read the spline ﬁts to the preceding and subsequent
orders, average them, and scale the result to match a
region far from the hydrogen line center. For Hα, which
falls in order 30, we deﬁne an alternative continuum by
rescaling the spline ﬁt to order 28. For Hβ, which falls
in order 11, we derive an alternative continuum from
order 13. Because order 1 is incomplete, we cannot use
it to model the continuum for the Hγ line, which falls
in order 2. Instead, we use a scaled ﬁt to order 3 as the
continuum model and to order 4 as the alternative. We
create two normalized spectra: for the ﬁrst, we divide
by the continuum model; for the second, we divide by
the alternative continuum. We use the alternative nor-
malization to estimate the uncertainties in our stellar
parameters due to errors in our continuum ﬁts.

3. ANALYSIS

3.1. Eﬀective Temperature from Ionization Balance

We determine the star’s eﬀective temperature by com-
paring the absorption features of multiple ionization
states of C, N, O, Si, and S. Consider the panel labeled
“Nitrogen” in Fig. 2. We ﬁt the COS N I λ1200 feature
with models (described in Section 3.3) assuming Teﬀ =
19,000 K and ﬁnd a best-ﬁt value of log N (N)/N (H) =
−5.16 ± 0.14. We repeat with models assuming Teﬀ =
20,000 K, 21,000 K, and 22,000 K. The best-ﬁt abun-
dances are plotted as black points and connected with
a low-order polynomial (evaluated at 10 K intervals).
Vertical bars represent the statistical uncertainties re-

turned by our ﬁtting routine. As the temperature rises,
the fraction of nitrogen in the neutral state falls, requir-
ing a higher nitrogen abundance to reproduce the ob-
served feature. Our Keck spectrum exhibits a number
of N II lines (Table 2). We ﬁt each of them individually
and plot the mean abundance as a function of temper-
ature in green. We ﬁt the N III λλ1183, 1185 doublet
in the FUSE spectrum in the same way and plot the
results in blue. (The N III features also appear in the
COS spectrum, but they yield abundances with larger
error bars, so we use the FUSE values.) As the fraction
of ionized nitrogen rises with temperature, the best-ﬁt
nitrogen abundance falls.

We repeat this process for C, O, Si, and S, ﬁtting
all of the features in the Keck spectrum (Table 2) and
selected features in the FUV (Table 3). With few excep-
tions, the abundance curves intersect between 21,000 K
and 22,000 K. To quantify this result, we compute the
error-weighted mean abundance and the error-weighted
standard deviation as a function of temperature for each

element. The mean abundance is plotted as a dashed
line in each panel. At each temperature step, we com-

where yi is the abundance derived from a single fea-
ture (or group of features; solid line), y(xi) is the mean
abundance (dashed line), σi is the statistical uncertainty
in the derived abundance (vertical bars), and the sum-
mation is taken over the 21 abundance curves plotted
in Fig. 2. χ2 has a minimum at Teﬀ = 21,400 K.
Our lower limit to the temperature is Teﬀ = 21,000
K, set by the point at which χ2 rises by 7.04 relative
to its minimum. This choice of ∆χ2 is strictly cor-
rect for a model with six interesting parameters (in our
case, one temperature and ﬁve abundances) if all errors
are normally distributed (Press et al. 1988). For each
element, our best-ﬁt abundance is the error-weighted
mean value (computed above) at the best-ﬁt tempera-
ture. The abundance uncertainty is the larger of the

Ten other metals, Mg, Al, P, Cl, Ar, Ti, Cr, Fe,

Barnard 28, but only of a single ionization state. (Argon
has absorption features from Ar II and Ar III, but the
resulting abundance curves do not cross.) We compute
their abundances just as for the lighter elements, but
do not include them in the calculation of the best-ﬁt
temperature. The absorption curves for these species
are presented in Fig. 3. The full set of abundances
for Barnard 29 is presented in Table 4 and plotted in
Fig. 4. Our results are generally consistent with those
of Thompson et al. (2007).

3.2. Surface Gravity and Helium Abundance

We determine the surface gravity from a simultaneous
ﬁt to the star’s Balmer lines (Hα, Hβ, and Hγ). Assum-
ing Teﬀ = 21,400 K, we ﬁnd that log g = 3.100 ± 0.003.
This value is not sensitive to small errors in the optical
continuum: Repeating the ﬁt using our alternative nor-
malization yields log g = 3.111 ± 0.003. Reducing the
temperature to 21,000 K yields log g = 3.071 ± 0.003;
we will adopt this value as the lower limit to the surface

perature and surface gravity yield a helium abundance
of log N (He)/N (H) = −0.89±0.04, where the abundance
is the error-weighted mean of our seven results, and the

uncertainty is their error-weighted standard deviation.
Reducing both the temperature and gravity to their
lower limits does not change this result. Our ﬁnal atmo-
spheric parameters are thus Teﬀ = 21, 400 ± 400 K, log g
= 3.10±0.03, and log N (He)/N (H) = −0.89±0.04. This
model successfully reproduces the hydrogen (Fig. 5) and
helium features (Fig. 6) in our HIRES spectrum.

Our metal abundances were derived using models with
log g = 3.0, but our ﬁnal value is log g = 3.1. How
sensitive are our abundances to this change in the sur-
face gravity? In our ﬁts to the N III λλ1183, 1185 dou-
blet in the FUSE spectrum, we found log N (N)/N (H) =
−4.41±0.16 using models with Teﬀ = 21,000 K and log g
= 3.0. Repeating the ﬁt using models with log g = 3.1
yields log N (N)/N (H) = −4.38 ± 0.15. The diﬀerence is
smaller than the uncertainty in any of our abundances.
Using Kurucz (1992) LTE models with [Fe/H] = −1.0
and scaled-solar abundances, Conlon et al. (1994) de-
rived stellar parameters of Teﬀ = 20, 000 ± 1000 K, log g
= 3.0 ± 0.1, and log N (He)/N (H) = −1.06 ± 0.20 for
Barnard 29. Thompson et al. (2007) used a grid of
NLTE models generated with TLUSTY and SYNSPEC,
just as we do, but their models included iron with an
abundance [Fe/H] = −1.1 and the light elements C, N,

O, Mg, Si, and S. They found Teﬀ = 20, 000±1000 K and
log g = 2.95 ± 0.1. Both groups determined the star’s
eﬀective temperature by ﬁtting its Si II and Si III lines
and its surface gravity by ﬁtting its Hγ line. These re-
sults are generally consistent with ours. We discuss the
use of silicon as temperature indicator in Section 4.1.4.

3.3. Model Atmospheres

We compute a grid of non-local thermodynamic equi-
librium (NLTE) stellar-atmosphere models using ver-
sion 205 of the program TLUSTY (Hubeny & Lanz
1995). The models are composed of hydrogen, helium,
nitrogen, oxygen and the element whose lines we wish
to ﬁt. The models have eﬀective temperatures Teﬀ =
19,000, 20,000, 21,000, and 22,000 K; a surface grav-
ity log g = 3.0; and abundances log N (He)/N (H) =
−0.9, log N (N)/N (H) = −4.3, and log N (O)/N (H) =
−4.5; these parameters are similar to those derived for
Barnard 29 by Thompson et al. (2007). When ﬁtting
optical hydrogen and helium lines to determine the sur-
face gravity and helium abundance, we use a grid with
surface gravities log g = 2.8 to 3.2 in steps of 0.1 dex and
helium abundances log N (He)/N (H) = −1.1 to −0.7 in
steps of 0.2 dex. We employ atomic models similar to

spectrum.
It was derived from a stellar atmosphere com-
puted with TLUSTY v205, which employs hydrogen colli-

halas et al. 1975.

those used by Lanz & Hubeny (2007) to compute their
grid of B-type stars.

From these model atmospheres, we compute synthetic
spectra using version 51 of the program SYNSPEC
(Hubeny 1988). For the Keck data, the synthetic spec-
tra are convolved with a Gaussian of FWHM = 0.1 ˚A to
replicate the observed spectrum. For the FUSE data,
the synthetic spectra are convolved with a Gaussian of
FWHM = 0.06 ˚A to match the FUSE line-spread func-
tion. For the COS G130M spectrum, we model the line-
spread function with a Gaussian of FWHM = 0.13 ˚A.
For the G160M spectrum, we employ the tabulated line-
spread functions appropriate for data obtained at Life-
time Position #1, which are available from the COS
website. For the GHRS spectrum, we adopt a Gaussian
with FWHM = 0.095 ˚A as the line-spread function.

For the elements P, Cl, Ti, Cr, Ni, and Ge, we lack the
model atoms necessary to compute full NLTE models.
For these species, we adopt an NLTE model atmosphere
with a H+He+N+O+Fe composition and compute the
ionization fractions of the element in question assum-
ing LTE. We assume log N (Fe)/N (H) = −6.0, which is
roughly the cluster abundance. For the iron-peak ele-
ments Ti, Cr, and Ni, we can use iron, for which we
have a complete set of models, to estimate the abun-
dance errors. To this end, we generate a second grid
of iron spectra using the LTE approximation. Accord-
ing to TLUSTY, the dominant ionization state of iron in

Figure 6. He I lines in the optical spectrum of Barnard 29

the lines appear in multiple spectral orders. The line at 6678
˚A appears to blended with another feature and is not used
to determine the helium abundance.

the stellar photosphere is Fe III. Fitting our LTE models
to the star’s Fe III lines yields an abundance consistent
with that derived from the NLTE models. Ti III, Cr III,
Fe III and Ni III have ionization energies of 27, 31, 31,
and 35 eV, respectively, so we expect their populations
to vary similarly with temperature.

SYNSPEC computes partition functions for only the
ﬁrst three ionization states of elements heavier than
nickel. As a result, there are by default no Ge IV features
in our synthetic spectra. To derive an abundance from
the star’s Ge IV lines, we must modify the program to in-
clude the ionization potentials and partition functions of
Ge IV and Ge V. We compute the partition functions by
considering all of the statistical weights and energy lev-
els provided by Sugar & Musgrove (1993). The atomic
data for the Ge IV 1189 ˚A and 1230 ˚A transitions are
from Morton (2000).

3.4. Spectral Fitting

Models are ﬁt to the data using a chi-squared mini-
mization routine. Because both the data and the syn-
thetic spectra are normalized, the only free parameter
is the abundance of the element in question. Our pro-

gram linearly interpolates between two model spectra to
compute a model with an intermediate abundance. The
abundance uncertainties quoted for individual line ﬁts
are one-standard deviation errors computed from the
covariance matrix returned by the ﬁtting routine; we
refer to these as statistical errors.

Continuum placement is the dominant uncertainty in
our ﬁts to the FUSE and COS spectra. The FUV spec-
tra of early B-type stars are riddled with absorption
lines, and even relatively ﬂat regions of the spectrum
are depressed by a myriad of weak absorption features.
Allowing our ﬁtting routines to scale the model to the
mean level of the “pseudo-continuum” would underesti-
mate the true continuum level. To address this problem,
we assume that, at high signal-to-noise ratios, small dips
in the spectrum are not noise features, but weak absorp-
tion lines, and we normalize the spectrum such that its
small-scale features peak at a value of 1.0. To estimate
the uncertainty inherent in this technique, we perform
each ﬁt twice, once with the model continuum ﬁxed at
unity and again with the model scaled by a factor of
0.97, which brings its continuum closer to the pseudo-
continuum of the observed spectrum. An example is pre-
sented in Fig. 7. The diﬀerence in the two abundances
is an estimate of the systematic error in our abundance
estimates. We add this term and the statistical error in
quadrature to compute our ﬁnal error.

Notes on individual elements:
Magnesium:

In the COS spectrum near the Mg II
λλ1734.9, 1737.6 doublet, the continuum is poorly con-
strained.

Silicon: The Si III 4552.6 ˚A feature is much stronger
than the N II 4552.5 ˚A line with which it is blended, so
we include it in our estimate of the silicon abundance.
Phosphorus: P III has resonance lines at 998.0 and
1003.6 ˚A, but they lie among a forest of iron and other
lines that are not included in our simple models. To
limit the eﬀects of blending on the wings of these P III
features, we ﬁt only the line cores, a spectral region
roughly the width of a single resolution element.

Sulfur: To limit the eﬀects of blending, we ﬁt only the

cores of the sulfur lines in the FUSE spectrum.

Chlorine: The Cl III resonance lines at 1005.3, 1008.8,
and 1015.0 ˚A lie in a crowded region of the spectrum, so
we ﬁt only the line cores and only the 1005.3 and 1008.8
˚A lines.

Argon: In the FUSE spectrum near the Ar III λ1002

line, the continuum level is poorly constrained.

Chromium: There are many Cr III lines between 1032
and 1042 ˚A. Most are blended with other species, but the
region between 1039 and 1041 ˚A contains a half dozen
lines that are reasonably well isolated.

29. The data are normalized as described in the text. The
red curve represents a model whose continuum is ﬁxed at
1.0. The blue curve represents a model whose continuum is
ﬁxed at 0.97. For this ﬁgure, the spectrum has been nor-
malized, binned by three pixels, and shifted to a laboratory
wavelength scale.

Nickel: In the FUSE spectrum near the Ni III λ980

line, the continuum level is poorly constrained.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Model Atmospheres

4.1.1. Hydrogen

Our models successfully reproduce the Hα line proﬁle,
which has a distinctive shape near the line center. To
do so, we call TLUSTY with the parameter ICOLHN =
1 (the default value), which triggers the use of hydro-
gen collisional excitation rates taken from Przybilla &
Butler (2004). Older versions of TLUSTY (prior to ver-
sion 202), which employ the collisional rates of Mihalas
et al. (1975), cannot reproduce this feature. In Fig. 5,
we plot the best-ﬁt spectra generated with TLUSTY
versions 200 (blue) and 205 (red); the red curve bet-
ter reproduces the line proﬁle. SYNSPEC version 51
oﬀers several sets of hydrogen line proﬁles. We have ex-
perimented with both the Lemke (1997) and Tremblay
& Bergeron (2009) proﬁles and ﬁnd that the resulting
spectra are indistinguishable.

4.1.2. Helium

Careful study of Fig. 6 reveals weak forbidden compo-
nents in the blue wings of the He I λ4388 and λ4922
features that are not well reproduced by our model,
while a similar component of the He I λ4471 feature
is well ﬁt.
In SYNSPEC, the He I λ4471 proﬁle is
taken from Barnard, Cooper, & Smith (1974, hereafter
BCS74), who provide a set of line proﬁles for electron
densities between 1013 and 1016 cm−3. The proﬁles of
the He I λ4026, λ4388, and λ4922 lines are from Shamey

(1969), who gives proﬁles for electron densities ranging
from 1014 to 3 × 1017 cm−3. The line-forming region of
our model atmosphere extends to stellar radii with elec-
tron densities lower than 1014 cm−3, a region of parame-
ter space not included in the Shamey models. Line pro-
ﬁles for the He I λ4922 line were computed by Barnard,
Cooper, & Smith (1975, hereafter BCS75). Their calcu-
lations are based on the work of BCS74 and cover the
same range of electron densities. We have incorporated
the BCS75 proﬁles into SYNSPEC. As shown in Fig. 8,
the absorption feature at 4920.5 ˚A is now well repro-
duced. Unfortunately, line proﬁles for the He I λ4388
line at electron densities lower than 1014 cm−3 are not
available, preventing us from computing a satisfactory
model for this line.

The only He II feature in our data is at 1640.4 ˚A.
We do not use this line when deriving the eﬀective tem-
perature or helium abundance, because the spectrum is
rather noisy in this region and the He II line is blended
with several metal features. Instead, we simply plot in
Fig. 9 the COS spectrum (black curve) and a model with
the helium abundance derived from our optical data (red
curve). The He II proﬁle is well reproduced by this
model.

4.1.3. Silicon II

Our initial set of model stellar atmospheres em-
ployed the silicon model atoms that Lanz & Hubeny
(2003, 2007) built to compute their grids of NLTE line-
blanketed model atmospheres of B and O stars. The
resulting synthetic spectra reproduce the Si III lines in
Table 2, but they also predict strong absorption from
the Si II features at 5041.0, 5056.0, 5056.3, 6347.1, and
6371.4 ˚A. Only the 5056.0, 6347.1, and 6371.4 ˚A lines
are observed, and all three are in emission (Fig. 10).

Figure 9. The He II λ1640 feature in the COS spectrum
of Barnard 29. The red curve is a model with the helium
abundance derived from our optical data. For this ﬁgure,
the spectrum has been normalized, binned by three pixels,
and shifted to a laboratory wavelength scale.

In an attempt to alleviate this discrepancy, we employ
a more elaborate set of silicon model atoms (retrieved
from I. Hubeny’s website) that include additional en-
ergy levels and allowed transitions: The new Si II model
contains 70 individual energy levels and considers 940
allowed transitions, the Si III model contains 122 levels
and considers 1648 transitions, and the Si IV model
contains 53 levels and considers 760 transitions. We use
these model atoms to generate a new grid of model stel-
lar atmospheres. Fits of the resulting synthetic spectra
to the Si III lines yield a lower silicon abundance and
weaker Si II absorption (blue curves in Fig. 10). The
models do predict faint Si II emission at still lower abun-
dance levels (magenta curves), but the lines weaken as
the silicon abundance is further decreased. While our
models do not produce Si II emission lines strong enough
to match the observed emission, they do explain quali-
tatively the behavior of the lines by predicting the Si II
λλ5056, 6347, and 6371 lines in emission and the Si II
λ4128.0 line in absorption, as reported by Thompson
et al. (2007).

Observations of weak metallic emission lines in the
optical spectra of B-type stars have been reported by
several authors (e.g., Sigut et al. 2000 and Wahlgren
& Hubrig 2000, 2004).
In particular, Sadakane &
Nishimura (2017) reported the detection of weak Si II
λ6239 and Al II λ6237 emission in the optical spectra
of B-type stars with low rotational velocities. Several of
these stars have eﬀective temperatures similar to that
of Barnard 29, but their gravities are higher by 0.6 to
1.1 dex. They are also signiﬁcantly more metal rich.
The Si II λ6239 line is not observed in the spectrum of
Barnard 29 because of the star’s low silicon abundance;
however, by raising the silicon abundance of our models

Dixon et al.

Figure 10. Si II emission in the HIRES spectrum of Barnard
29. The red curve represents our initial ﬁt to the observed
Si III features, which yields log N (Si)/N (H) = −5.12. At
this abundance, the Si II lines are predicted to be strong ab-
sorption features. The blue curve represents a second model,
using more sophisticated silicon model atoms, also ﬁt to the
Si III features. With an abundance of log N (Si)/N (H) =
−5.57, this model predicts weaker Si II absorption. If we fur-
ther reduce the abundance, we ﬁnd that these lines go into
emission at abundances lower than log N (Si)/N (H) = −5.80;
the emission reaches a maximum around log N (Si)/N (H) =
−6.4 (magenta curve).

to log N (Si)/N (H) = −4.80, we can generate synthetic
spectra with the Si II λ6239 line in emission and the Si II
λλ5056.0, 6347.1, and 6371.4 lines in absorption, repro-
ducing the pattern seen by Sadakane & Nishimura. This
result strengthens our conﬁdence in these models and
demonstrates that variations in the silicon abundance
can explain, at least qualitatively, the pattern in the
Si II lines that is observed in both Barnard 29 and some
of the B-type stars analyzed by Sadakane & Nishimura.

4.1.4. Silicon III

Conlon et al. (1994) derived an eﬀective temperature
of Teﬀ = 20, 000 ± 1000 K by requiring that the Si II
line at 4128 ˚A and the Si III triplet at 4552, 4567, and
4574 ˚A yield consistent silicon abundances. Thompson
et al. (2007) employed the same technique (with the ad-
dition of Si III λ5739) and achieved the same result. Our
equilibrium analysis includes these Si III lines, yet yields
an eﬀective temperature of 21,400 K. Why might that
be? In Fig. 11 we plot the abundances derived from
each of the Si III features in our Keck spectrum. We
cannot model our Si II lines, so we use the equivalent
width of the Si II λ4128 line published by Thompson
et al. to derive a silicon abundance. We see that the

Figure 11. Deriving the eﬀective temperature from silicon
lines in the optical spectrum of Barnard 29. The Si II curve
is computed from the equivalent width of Si II λ4128 pub-
lished by Thompson et al. 2007. The Si III curves are derived
from features in our Keck spectrum. Points with error bars
represent the abundance derived from model ﬁts to each ab-
sorption feature. Solid lines are low-order polynomial ﬁts to
the measured points.

Si II curve crosses those for the Si III triplet at Teﬀ
∼ 20, 500 K, while it crosses the curve for Si III λ5739
at Teﬀ ∼ 21, 300 K. This plot is derived from models
using oscillator strengths from Kurucz (1992); models
using oscillator strengths from the more recent compli-
ation of Kelleher & Podobedova (2008) show an even
greater diﬀerence (∼ 1000 K) between the intersection
points. Apparently, the Si III triplet yields systemati-
cally lower abundances than does Si III λ5739, leading to
a lower eﬀective temperature from an equilibrium anal-
ysis. The Keck Si III curve in Fig. 2 represents the mean
of the four Si III curves shown here.

4.1.5. Microturbulence

Microturbulence is an ad hoc parameter originally in-
troduced to reconcile discrepancies between theoretical
In a
and empirical curves of growth (Mihalas 1978).
traditional abundance analysis based on absorption-line
equivalent widths, the microturbulent velocity ξ is ad-
justed to remove any trend in abundance for individ-
ual atomic transitions as a function of the lower excita-
tion potential or line strength. In practical terms, mi-
croturbulence corrects for (or obscures) deﬁciencies in
plane-parallel atmospheric models, including errors in
the treatment of collisional broadening, dynamical ef-
fects, inhomogeneities, and non-LTE eﬀects.

In calculating our atmospheric models, we have set
ξ = 0 km s−1. To explore the implications of this deci-
sion, we calculate a second set of models assuming ξ = 4
km s−1, the value adopted by Thompson et al. (2007),
and compare them to the data. The top row of Fig. 12
shows a set of nitrogen and oxygen features ﬁt to the

AASTEX Barnard 29 in M13

(Gratton et al. 2004). The abundance pattern seen in
Barnard 29 — C depletion and N enhancement relative
to the average value for FG stars on the RGB — sug-
gests that the star experienced the full impact of deep
mixing.

4.2.1. Iron Abundance

The iron abundance of Barnard 29 has been a puzzle-
ment for more than two decades. Conlon et al. (1994)
set an upper limit of log N (Fe)/N (H) < −5.30 ± 0.30
from an optical spectrum of the star. Dixon & Hurwitz
(1998) observed Barnard 29 with the Berkeley Spec-
trometer, which spans the same wavelength range as
FUSE, but at lower resolution. Fitting spectra de-
rived from Kurucz (1992) models to the region be-
tween 1115 and 1160 ˚A, they derived log N (Fe)/N (H) =
−6.70+0.22
−0.26. Both Moehler et al. (1998) and Thompson
et al. (2007) modeled the star’s GHRS spectrum, deriv-
ing log N (Fe)/N (H) = −6.79±0.10 and log N (Fe)/N (H)
= −6.6 ± 0.1, respectively. All of these FUV-derived
values are signiﬁcantly lower than the cluster iron abun-
dance of log N (Fe)/N (H) = −6.05 (M´esz´aros et al.
2015).
found that ﬁts
to the star’s optical spectrum yield log N (Fe)/N (H)
−5.93±0.12, a value consistent with the cluster metallic-
ity. Canonical stellar-evolution theory predicts no evolu-
tionary changes in the iron abundance of low-mass stars
like those in Galactic globular clusters today (Iben &
Renzini 1983).

Strangely, Thompson et al.

We have independently derived the iron abundance of
Barnard 29 from its Keck, FUSE, COS, and GHRS spec-
tra. Our values are consistent with one another (Fig. 3)
and with the cluster iron abundance (Fig. 4). To un-
derstand the diﬀerence between our results and those of
previous authors, we have conducted a series of numeri-
cal experiments, systematically testing the assumptions
made by Moehler et al. (1998). Following them, we ﬁt
the entire suite of Fe III features in the GHRS spectrum.
Using models with a microturbulent velocity ξ = 0 km
s−1, we derive an iron abundance log N (Fe)/N (H) =
−6.16 ± 0.16. Moehler et al. adopt the value ξ = 10
km s−1 derived by Conlon et al. (1994). Using mod-
els with ξ = 10 km s−1, we derive an iron abundance
log N (Fe)/N (H) = −6.79 ± 0.09, which matches the
Moehler et al. result. Assuming a spectral resolution
of FHWM = 0.07 ˚A, employing LTE models, or adopt-
ing the atomic data presented by Moehler et al. does
not further reduce the derived iron abundance.

Abundances derived from FUV spectra are sensitive to
the assumed value of the microturbulent velocity. Many
FUV lines are saturated, and over-estimating the mi-
croturbulence results in an under-estimate of the abun-

Keck spectrum using models with ξ = 0 km s−1. For
this ﬁgure, each line is ﬁt independently, and the result-
ing abundance is listed. The bottom row shows the same
features ﬁt using models with ξ = 4 km s−1. While the
abundances are little changed, the quality of the ﬁt is
obviously poorer, as evidenced by the increase in χ2. We
conclude that the data are best reproduced by models
with ξ = 0 km s−1.

4.2. Photospheric Abundances

Galactic globular clusters host multiple stellar popu-
lations. First-generation (FG) stars display abundances
typical of halo ﬁeld stars, while second-generation (SG)
stars, which may have multiple subpopulations, are en-
riched in Na and Al and depleted in O and Mg. Models
suggest that the second generation is formed from gas
polluted by material expelled by massive stars of the
ﬁrst generation. (For details, see the review by Bastian
& Lardo 2018.) M´esz´aros et al. (2015) identiﬁed two
stellar populations on the RGB of M13. FG stars (blue
lines in Fig. 4) are richer in O and poorer in Al than
SG stars (green lines). Barnard 29 is clearly a FG star,
richer in O and poorer in Al. The star is depleted in C
and enhanced in N; otherwise, its abundances appear to
have changed little since it left the RGB. In particular,
its low carbon abundance (NC/NO = 0.03) indicates
that the star did not undergo third dredge-up.

In addition to the abundance trends attributable to
multiple populations, M´esz´aros et al. (2015) ﬁnd a clear
correlation in the abundance of carbon with eﬀective
temperature in M13. The authors interpret this trend
as a sign of “deep mixing,” a nonconvective mixing pro-
cess that results in a steady depletion of the surface
carbon abundance and an enhancement in the nitrogen
abundance in low-mass stars as they evolve up the RGB

dance. Conlon et al. (1994) derive ξ = 10 ± 2 km s−1 by
minimizing the scatter in the abundance derived from
17 oxygen lines in the star’s optical spectrum. Dixon &
Hurwitz (1998) employ Kurucz models with ξ = 2 km
s−1, while Thompson et al. (2007) derive ξ = 4 ± 2 km
s−1 from ﬁts to O II and Si III lines.

4.2.2. Zirconium Abundance

In a preliminary analysis of the FUSE and COS data
(Dixon et al. 2011), we attributed the strong absorption
feature at 1184 ˚A to Zr IV; however, recent calculations
of Zr IV oscillator strengths by Rauch et al. (2017) raise
doubts about this identiﬁcation. Zr IV λ1184 should
be accompanied by Zr IV λ1220, as both are resonance
transitions, yet the λ1220 feature is not seen. The hot
sub-dwarf B star CPD−64 481 has an eﬀective temper-
ature Teﬀ = 27,500 K (O’Toole et al. 2005), similar to
that of Barnard 29. Examination of a high-resolution
spectrum of CPD−64 481 obtained with the HST STIS
E140H grating reveals that Zr IV λ1184 is blended with
another, unidentiﬁed feature. We conclude that the 1184
˚A feature cannot be used to derive the Zr abundance of
stars observed at the resolution of FUSE or COS.

4.3. Stellar Mass and Luminosity

We can derive a star’s radius, and from this its mass
and luminosity, by comparing its observed and predicted
ﬂux. The spectral irradiance of Barnard 29 has been
measured in several bands: B = 12.934, V = 13.116,
I = 13.303 mag (Sandquist et al. 2010), for which we
assume an uncertainty of 0.003 mag. The extinction
toward M13 is E(B −V ) = 0.02 ± 0.01 mag (Harris
2010). We model the stellar continuum using an NLTE
model, similar to the H+He+N+O+Fe models described
in Section 3.3 but with our best-ﬁt atmospheric pa-
rameters, scaled by a Cardelli et al. (1989) extinction
curve with RV = 3.1. We compute synthetic stellar
magnitudes using the Python package Pysynphot (Lim
et al. 2015), adjusting the magnitude zero points as de-
scribed by Dixon et al. (2017). The data are best ﬁt
with a scale factor φ = (1.216 ± 0.002) × 10−21. We
repeat the ﬁt assuming an extinction E(B −V ) = 0.03
and get φ = (1.251 ± 0.002) × 10−21. Combining this
change with the statistical error yields a ﬁnal scale fac-
tor φ = (1.22 ± 0.04) × 10−21.

In the synthetic spectra generated by SYNSPEC, the
ﬂux is expressed in terms of the ﬂux moment, Hλ. If the
star’s radius and distance are known, then the scale fac-
tor required to convert the model to the ﬂux at earth is
φ = 4π(R∗/d)2 (Kurucz 1979). Unfortunately, we can-
not use results from Gaia Data Release 2 to constrain
the distance to M13, as Gaia globular-cluster parallaxes
suﬀer from signiﬁcant systematic errors (Helmi et al.

2018). Recent published values range from 7.1 kpc (Har-
ris 2010) to 7.9 kpc (O’Malley et al. 2017). Adopting
this distance range and our scale factor, we derive a stel-
lar radius R∗/R(cid:12) between 3.11 and 3.45. Applying our
best-ﬁt surface gravity (log g = 3.1), we ﬁnd that the
stellar mass M∗/M(cid:12) is between 0.45 and 0.55. Finally,
combining the stellar radius with our best-ﬁt eﬀective
temperature (Teﬀ = 21,400 K), we derive a stellar lumi-
nosity log L∗/L(cid:12) between 3.26 and 3.35, slightly greater
than the range log L∗/L(cid:12) = 3.08 – 3.25 estimated by
Conlon et al. (1994). All derived values (radius, mass,
and luminosity) scale with the cluster distance.

4.4. Evolutionary Status

The post-HB evolution of M13 stars is illustrated in
Fig. 13. The coolest (Teﬀ (cid:46) 8,000 K), most massive
(MZAHB (cid:38) 0.70M(cid:12)) stars populate the red horizontal
branch (RHB, red points). As they depart the HB, they
evolve to the red and ascend the AGB. Stars on the blue
horizontal branch (BHB, blue points) are hotter (8,000
K (cid:46) Teﬀ (cid:46) 20,000 K) and have lower masses (0.52 (cid:46)
MZAHB (cid:46) 0.70M(cid:12)). Most post-BHB stars also climb
the AGB and reach the thermal-pulsing AGB phase, but
only for a short time. The hottest (Teﬀ (cid:38) 20,000 K),
least-massive (MZAHB (cid:46) 0.52M(cid:12)) stars populate the
extreme horizontal branch (EHB, cyan points). Most
of these stars do not climb the AGB after the He-core
burning phase, but evolve to high luminosities with little
change in temperature. Post-EHB stars are also known
as AGB-manqu´e stars. Stars near the boundary between
the EHB and the BHB (Teﬀ ∼ 20,000 K, MZAHB ∼
0.52M(cid:12)) follow an intermediate path: they climb the
AGB, but depart before reaching the thermal-pulsing
phase, becoming post-early AGB (post-EAGB) stars.

The tracks plotted in Fig. 13 represent an extension
of the work presented by Miller Bertolami (2016). The
models are computed for [Fe/H] = −1.5 and a zero-
age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of MZAMS = 0.83 M(cid:12)
(age 11.7 Gyr), assuming a scaled-solar metal content
with initial abundances ZZAMS = 0.000548, YZAMS =
0.246096, and XZAMS = 0.753356. Winds on the RGB
are adjusted to populate the extreme, blue, and red hor-
izontal branches. Zero-age horizontal-branch (ZAHB)
masses are MZAHB = 0.83, 0.75 and 0.70 M(cid:12) (ﬁnal
masses MWD = 0.557, 0.550, and 0.540M(cid:12)) for the RHB
(red points); MZAHB = 0.65, 0.60, 0.55, and 0.53 M(cid:12) (ﬁ-
nal masses MWD = 0.525, 0.519, 0.505, and 0.501 M(cid:12))
for the BHB (blue points); and MZAHB = 0.51, 0.50,
and 0.495 M(cid:12) (ﬁnal masses MWD = 0.500, 0.499, and
0.495 M(cid:12)) for the EHB (cyan points). The dark-cyan
points show the evolution of the hottest possible post-
EHB model. This sequence corresponds to a Late Hot-

AASTEX Barnard 29 in M13

15

log L∗/L(cid:12) ∼ 3.26. These values have interesting impli-
cations for the star’s evolutionary history. No HB star
can have a mass less than 0.49 M(cid:12), because core helium
ignition is impossible at such low masses. An evolved
star with M∗/M(cid:12) < 0.49 must have experienced ex-
treme mass loss on the RGB (more even than the clus-
ter’s EHB stars), left the RGB before the helium-core
ﬂash, and is now evolving directly from the RGB to
the white-dwarf cooling curve, where it will become a
helium-core white dwarf. The fact that M13 has a large
population of extreme EHB stars suggests that it may
also have a population of lower-mass post-RGB stars,
because a ﬁnely-tuned mass-loss process would be re-
quired to remove just enough material from RGB stars
to produce a large population of the hottest EHB stars
without creating any lower-mass objects. So it is not
unthinkable that Barnard 29 is a post-RGB star. On
the other hand, only the most massive post-RGB stars
would be as luminous as Barnard 29. According to
stellar-evolution models, a post-RGB star with the lumi-
nosity of Barnard 29 would have a mass M∗/M(cid:12) = 0.48,
greater than the derived value for this distance. Conse-
quently, a post-RGB origin for Barnard 29 is unlikely.

If the cluster lies at the high end of the allowed range
(d ∼ 7.9 kpc), then M∗/M(cid:12) ∼ 0.55 and log L∗/L(cid:12) ∼
3.35, values consistent with the star’s being a post-
BHB star. At an intermediate distance, the mass of
Barnard 29 would lie between these extremes; values
M∗/M(cid:12) (cid:46) 0.52 would place the star on one of the post-
EHB evolutionary tracks. We can exclude the hottest
EHB track in Fig. 13, which yields a white dwarf with
mass around 0.495 M(cid:12).
It traces the path of AGB-
manqu´e stars that evolve directly from the HB to the
white-dwarf cooling curve. Barnard 29 is clearly cooler
and more luminous than this track, suggesting a mass
M∗/M(cid:12) (cid:38) 0.5.

In light of stellar-evolution models, it seems likely that
Barnard 29 is a post-HB star evolving from a ZAHB star
with MZAHB between 0.50 and 0.55 M(cid:12), a range span-
ning the EHB/BHB boundary. A post-HB star would
have fully ascended the RGB, consistent with our sug-
gestion that Barnard 29 experienced the full eﬀects of
nonconvective mixing on the RGB. Its relatively low
mass is consistent with our conclusion that the star did
not experience third dredge-up.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have performed a spectral analysis of the UV-
bright star Barnard 29 in M13. By requiring multiple
ionization states of C, N, O, Si, and S to yield consis-
tent abundances, we derive an eﬀective temperature Teﬀ
= 21, 400 ± 400 K. We derive a surface gravity log g =

Flasher sequence (see Battich et al. 2018 for a detailed
explanation) that undergoes a violent H-burning event
during the He-core ﬂash and ends as a H-deﬁcient ZAHB
model (surface abundances [H, He, C, N] = [2.3 × 10−4,
0.9636, 0.024, 0.012] by mass fraction), with a ZAHB
mass of MZAHB = 0.49 M(cid:12) (ﬁnal mass MWD = 0.489
M(cid:12)).

To these evolutionary tracks we have added a sample
of M13 stars from Nardiello et al. (2018), who provide
a ﬁve-band catalog of stellar magnitudes from the HST
UV Legacy Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters (Pi-
otto et al. 2015) and the ACS Globular Cluster Survey
(Sarajedini et al. 2007). Eﬀective temperatures are es-
timated from F275W − F438W colors, and luminosities
from F606W magnitudes. We use Castelli & Kurucz
(2003) models with [Fe/H] = −1.5 to determine these
relationships. The cluster distance and reddening are
taken from Harris (2010). Barnard 29 is indicated by a
vertical orange bar that spans the range of luminosities
derived in Section 4.3.

M13 hosts only a handful of RHB stars, but its BHB
and EHB are well populated. In Fig. 13, we see a number
of hot stars more luminous than the HB. Some appear to
be following the post-BHB tracks toward the AGB, and
some the post-EHB tracks toward the white-dwarf cool-
ing curve. Sandquist et al. (2010) estimate that roughly
one-third of the post-HB stars in M13 are on post-EHB
tracks.

The derived mass and luminosity of Barnard 29 de-
pend on its distance. If M13 lies at the low end of the
allowed range (d ∼ 7.1 kpc), then M∗/M(cid:12) ∼ 0.45 and

3.10±0.03 from the star’s Balmer lines. Using the latest
version of TLUSTY, we are able to reproduce the ob-
served Hα proﬁle. By adding He I line proﬁles to SYN-
SPEC, we reproduce the absorption feature at 4920.5 ˚A.
Although our models predict faint Si II emission in the
optical, they cannot reproduce the strength of the ob-
served features. We derive the photospheric abundances
of He, C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, Ti, Cr, Fe,
Ni, and Ge. Barnard 29 exhibits an abundance pattern
typical of ﬁrst-generation stars in M13, though an un-
derabundance of C and an overabundance of N suggest
that the star experienced nonconvective mixing on the
RGB. This pattern appears to have changed little since
the star left the RGB. In particular, the star did not
undergo third dredge-up. Previous workers have found
that the star’s FUV spectra yield an iron abundance
about 0.5 dex lower than its optical spectrum. The
iron abundances derived from our Keck, FUSE, COS,
and GHRS spectra are consistent with one another and
with the cluster value. We attribute the diﬀerence to
our use of model atmospheres without microturbulence,
which is ruled out by the quality of the ﬁts to the op-
tical N II and O II lines. Barnard 29 lies in a region
of the temperature-luminosity plane that is traversed
by both post-BHB and post-EHB evolutionary tracks.
Comparison with stellar-evolution models suggests that
it evolved from a ZAHB star of mass M∗/M(cid:12) between
0.50 and 0.55, close to the EHB/BHB boundary.
