ABSTRACT

Aims. To study the dynamical evolution of trans-equatorial loops (TELs) using imaging and spectroscopy.
Methods. We have used the images recorded by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager on-board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory and spectroscopic observations taken from the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on-board
Hinode.
Results. The data from AIA 193 Å channel show that TELs are formed between AR 12230 and a newly emerging AR 12234 and
evolved during December 10–14, 2014. The xt-plots for December 12, 2014 obtained using AIA 193 Å data reveal signatures of
inﬂow and outﬂow towards an X-region. High cadence AIA images also show recurrent intensity enhancements in close proximity to
the X-region (P2), which is observed to have higher intensities for spectral lines formed at log T [K] =6.20 and voids at other higher
temperatures. The electron densities and temperatures in the X-region (and P2) are maintained steadily at log Ne =8.5–8.7 cm−3 and
log T [K] =6.20, respectively. Doppler velocities in the X-region show predominant redshifts by about 5–8 km s−1 when closer to the
disk centre but blueshifts (along with some zero-velocity pixels) when away from the centre. The Full-Width-Half-Maxima (FWHM)
maps reveal non-thermal velocities of about 27–30 km s−1 for Fe xii, Fe xiii and Fe xv lines. However, the brightest pixels have non-
thermal velocities ∼62 km s−1 for Fe xii and Fe xiii lines. On the contrary, the dark X-region for Fe xv line have the highest non-thermal
velocity (∼115 km s−1).
Conclusions. We conclude that the TELs are formed due to magnetic reconnection. We further note that the TELs themselves un-
dergo magnetic reconnection leading to reformation of loops of individual ARs. Moreover, this study, for the ﬁrst time, provides
measurements of plasma parameters in X-regions thereby providing essential constraints for theoretical studies.

1. Introduction

It is well established that the solar corona is full of loop struc-
tures (see, e.g., Reale 2014, for a review) as well as diﬀuse emis-
sions (Del Zanna & Mason 2003; Tripathi et al. 2009; Viall &
Klimchuk 2011; Subramanian et al. 2014). One of those are the
trans-equatorial loops (TELs), which join ARs across the equator
of the Sun. The theoretical existence of such loop structures was
ﬁrst suggested by Babcock (1961) as a consequence of the solar
dynamo. However, such loops were ﬁrst reported over a decade
later in 1974 using the observations recorded by the X-Ray Tele-
scope (XRT) on-board Skylab (Vaiana et al. 1974). Based on the
subsequent observations of ARs associated with McMath plage
numbers 12472 and 12474, Chase et al. (1976) and Svestka et al.
(1977) suggested that the TELs were formed due to magnetic
reconnection between two ARs.

Using the observations recorded by the Soft X-ray Telescope
(Tsuneta et al. 1991) on-board Yohkoh, Tsuneta (1996) reported
the formation of X-type topology in TELs connecting two ARs
in two hemispheres. This has been followed by a number of au-
thors (Fárník et al. 1999; Pevtsov 2000; Fárník et al. 2001; Fárník
& Švestka 2002; Crooker et al. 2002; Pevtsov 2004; Chen et al.
2006, 2007; Wang et al. 2007; Shimojo et al. 2007; Yokoyama &
Masuda 2009, 2010) reporting the formation, characteristics and
evolution of TELs, using the observations taken from SXT as
well as the X-Ray Telescope (XRT; Golub et al. 2007) on-board
Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007).

The early spectroscopic diagnostics of TELs were reported
by authors viz., Harra et al. (2003) and Brosius (2006) using the
observations recorded by the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer
(CDS; Harrison et al. 1995) on-board the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO; Domingo et al. 1995). However, we em-
phasize that these spectroscopic measurements were performed
in and along the oﬀ-limb TELs only.

X-shaped regions (cusp regions) are believed to be signatures
of magnetic reconnection, for e.g., Tsuneta et al. (1992); Forbes
& Acton (1996); Tripathi et al. (2006, 2007). Therefore, mea-
surement of plasma parameters in the X-shaped structure formed
between the TELs may help us probe the physical properties of
reconnection regions. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
such measurements till date for TELs.

In this paper, we perform a detailed study of a complete se-
quence of the formation and evolution of a set of TELs using
the observations taken from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Schou et al. 2012a,b) on-board the Solar Dynamics Ob-
servatory (SDO; Boerner et al. 2012; Pesnell et al. 2012). This is
accompanied with spectroscopic observations recorded with the
Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; Culhane et al.
2007) on-board Hinode. The rest of the paper is structured as
follows. In §2, we discuss the observations used for this study.
Data analysis and results are presented in §3. Finally, we sum-
marize and discuss the results in §4.

2. Observations and data

In this work, we have primarily used the AIA and EIS obser-
vations. AIA provides near-simultaneous full-disk observations
of the solar atmosphere in 7 EUV channels sensitive to diﬀer-
ent temperatures (O’Dwyer et al. 2010; Del Zanna et al. 2011;
Boerner et al. 2012) with an approximate time cadence of 12 s
and a pixel size of 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48). EIS provides spectroscopic observa-
tions in two wavelength bands, CCD A (170–210 Å) and CCD B
(250–290 Å) using four slit widths 1, 2, 4 and 250(cid:48)(cid:48). We have
used the AIA observations to study the long term evolution of
the TELs and EIS observations to measure the physical plasma
parameters such as electron density, temperature, Doppler veloc-
ities and non-thermal widths.

A portion of the solar disk observed on the AIA 193 Å chan-
nel on December 12, 2014 at 19:35:30 UT, is shown in panel
A of Fig. 1. The over-plotted green box indicates the region-
of-interest (ROI) and displayed in panel B and considered for
further study. The over-plotted white box in both panels A &
B shows the EIS raster ﬁeld-of-view (FOV). In panel B, we
overplot two white dashed lines crossing each other to high-
light the X-shaped structure. Fortuitously, the top part of the EIS
raster FOV covers this X-shaped region. Also, the blue (posi-
tive) and black (negative) contours represent the Line-Of-Sight
(LOS) magnetic ﬂux density of 500 G as observed at a near-
simultaneous time (19:35:40 UT) by HMI. The same HMI image
is shown in panel (C) where we clearly see two bipolar active
regions (AR 12230 and AR 12234) on either side of the solar
equator.

We note that EIS rastered this region four times dur-
ing 10:16:00–11:17:00 UT, 19:04:33–20:05:25 UT, 20:40:00–
21:41:30 UT and 22:16:00–23:17:00 UT on December 12th,
2014 using the 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slit. We denote these rasters as ‘E1’, ‘E2’,
‘E3’ and ‘E4’, respectively, where E2 is the closest to the disk
center. All these rasters are 60-steps rasters that covered a FOV
of 120(cid:48)(cid:48)×512(cid:48)(cid:48). We have processed all the AIA and EIS observa-
tions with the standard software provided in Solarsoft (Freeland
& Handy 1998).

taken from Brown et al. (2008) and peak formation temperatures
derived from CHIANTI (Dere et al. 1996; Del Zanna et al. 2015).
The reference wavelength for Doppler velocities are derived us-
ing the relatively cooler lines, Fe viii and Si vii for CCD A and
CCD B, respectively. For this purpose, we have used the aver-
aged spectra for all pixels belonging to rows 50–149 (from the
bottom) of the EIS raster (highlighted by the white box in panels
A and B of Fig. 1) because these represent the quiet Sun better.
However, we have ignored the bottom 0–49 rows due to missing
data. We have used the eis_auto_ﬁt.pro package1 that rectiﬁes
the EIS spectral data by removing the errors due to orbital drift
and slit tilt. An uncertainty of ∼5 km s−1 is expected on EIS ve-
locity estimates 2.

We note that there are four line pairs, viz., Fe xi, Fe xii, Fe xiii
and Fe xiv (labelled with a, b in Table 1), which are suitable
to estimate the electron densities at four diﬀerent temperatures
(see e.g., Young et al. 2007; Tripathi et al. 2010, and reference
therein). For Fe xii, the spectral line identiﬁed at 186.88 Å has
two components at 186.854 Å and 186.887 Å. Moreover, Fe xii
195.119 Å line has a self-blend at 195.179 Å, which is signiﬁ-
cant (> 5%) only at log Ne > 9.5 cm−3 (Young et al. 2009). We
have considered both the lines for our study. The Fe xiii 203.8 Å
line, too, is a combination of 203.79 and 203.82 Å lines, with a
component of Fe xii at 203.72 Å. Therefore, the total intensity
under the Fe xiii line at 203.8 Å is the total of 203.79+203.82 Å
intensities. Hence we have ﬁtted two Gaussians to separate out
Fe xii and Fe xiii lines. The two Fe xiv lines are not blended and
have been ﬁtted with single Gaussians.

3. Data Analysis and Results

3.1. Formation and Evolution of TELs

Fig. 2 displays the evolution of the two ARs between December
10–14, 2014 as observed with AIA using 193 Å ﬁlter. The AR
12230 in the southern hemisphere ﬁrst appeared on the visible
side of the solar disk on 5th December 20143. However, it was
identiﬁed as an AR and given its number on 7th December 2014.
The other AR 12234 located in the northern hemisphere was ﬁrst
detected on 10th December 2014. To show the evolution of the
structures better, note that we have diﬀerentially rotated all the
images displayed here at 19:35:30 UT on 12th December 2014
that corresponds to the center time of the EIS raster E2. Fig. 2
demonstrates that as early as on 10th December, the two ARs
have individual loop structures along with a slight hint of faint
TELs, connecting the two ARs. These TELs become prominent
on 12th December (panel C), along with an X-shaped structure
that is observed between x = [140(cid:48)(cid:48), 260(cid:48)(cid:48)] and y = [-80(cid:48)(cid:48), -20(cid:48)(cid:48)]
(see panels D, E and F). The X-shaped structure exists through
12th December. By 13th December, the ARs drift across the
disk, towards the western limb, with gradual disorientation of
the loops. The very well-deﬁned morphology of the TELs are no
longer visible on or after 14th December.

An animation tel12dec.gif created with data taken at a ca-
dence of 30 minutes using the AIA 193 Å channel images on
12th December, shows a continuous interaction amongst the
loops belonging to the individual ARs as well as the TELs. On
the one hand, we identify epochs when loops belonging to indi-
vidual ARs interact and form TELs (e.g., refer to the frames at

The EIS rasters included several spectral lines spread over a
broad range of temperatures (log [T/K] = 5.80 − 6.35). Table 1

loops are formed. The over-plotted green box shows the FOV of AIA that is considered for further analysis. The white box is the FOV that was
rastered using EIS. Panel (B): Zoom-in view of AIA 193 Å images corresponding to the green box in the left panel showing the X-type topology

±500 G as observed by HMI at 19:35:40 UT. Panel (C): HMI LOS magnetogram image at the same instant as shown in the contours of panel B.

13:00 hours in the animation). On the other hand, we also iden-
tify the interaction among the TELs leading to the reformation of
loops belonging to their parent ARs. To highlight this, we show
in panel A of Fig. 3 loops belonging to individual ARs (marked
as ‘I’), along with some TELs on the left of the FOV (marked as
‘T’). In panel B, we see the ‘I’ loops coming close enough so as
to merge and form new TELs on the right of the X-region. Simi-
larly, we see these TELs interacting amongst themselves in panel
C. Finally, in panel D, we see such TELs have been annihilated
to form more loops belonging to the two ARs.

3.2. Loop dynamics

To further understand the dynamics of the loops, we created xt-
plots along two artiﬁcial 10-pixels wide slits named ‘V’ and ‘H’
(see panel A in Fig. 4). For this purpose, we have used the data
taken on December 12, 2014, with AIA 193Å at a cadence of 1
minute. Panels B and C of Fig. 4 show the xt-plots corresponding
to the slits V and H, respectively. The horizontal black dashed
lines trace the locus of point P labelled in panel A whereas
the solid vertical black lines locate the four EIS raster phases,
marked as E1, E2, E3 and E4.

The xt-plot corresponding to the slit V (panel B) demon-
strates the inward movement of the structures from the very be-

ginning and appear to merge soon after the raster E1, approxi-
mately between 12:00 and 13:00 UT. Such inward motion in the
xt-plot along the slit V suggests the evolution of loops belonging
to individual active regions and moving closer to each other. Dur-
ing the same interval, the xt-plot corresponding to slit H (panel
C) reveals hints of outward motion, though not as systematic as
the case for the inward movement. The outward movement in the
xt-plot for slit H suggests the structures are moving away. Com-
bining the two xt-plots, we infer that loops belonging to the indi-
vidual active regions are evolving. Their tips are coming closer
to each other, leading to magnetic reconnection and formation of
the TELs. We have highlighted the inward and outward motions
with blue slanted (dashed-doted) lines in panels B and C.

After 13:00 UT, the motions observed in the two xt-plots re-
verse direction till about 19:00 UT. The reversing of movements
suggests that during this period, the TELs are evolving and mov-
ing towards each other. During this time, the TELs reconnect
and lead to the reformation of the loops belonging to individ-
ual active regions. Beyond 19:00 UT on December 12, 2014, the
motion is similar to that is observed during the ﬁrst phase.

We have used the over-plotted blue dashed-dotted lines in
panel B (by eye estimation) to obtain the inﬂow speeds during
the ﬁrst and third phases. The inﬂow speeds are 1 and 3 km s−1,
whereas the outﬂow speed for the second phase is 1.5 km s−1.

images for ﬁve days from December 10–14, 2014. The over-plotted blue box in panel (F) shows the EIS raster FOV. All the AIA data shown here
are diﬀerentially rotated to the center time of raster E2.

Due to ambiguous patterns observed in the xt-plot shown in
panel C, we did not measure speeds along the slit H. Simi-
lar values of inﬂows and outﬂow speeds were also reported by
Yokoyama et al. (2001) in an observation related to a ﬂare.

3.3. Identiﬁcation of the reconnection point with AIA images

As mentioned earlier, the X-region was rastered with EIS four
times on 12th December. Since the raster takes time to scan
through the FOV, we identify a region that was simultaneously
observed by AIA and EIS slits. For this purpose, we plot in Fig. 5
the AIA intensity maps in 193 Å channel corresponding to ‘E2’
(panels A–F and H). However, the ROI plotted in these maps is
between y=[-80(cid:48)(cid:48), 10(cid:48)(cid:48)]) so as to highlight the dynamics/ features
in the neighbourhood of the X-region. We identify intermittent
brightenings occurring between x=[217(cid:48)(cid:48), 222(cid:48)(cid:48)] and y=[-34(cid:48)(cid:48),
-29(cid:48)(cid:48)], which is henceforth identiﬁed as ‘P2’ (marked with the
yellow box). Coincidentally, this region is also observed by four
EIS raster exposures (highlighted by the white vertical lines in
panel C).

In panel G (just beneath panel C), we plot the average
light curve in this box with a cadence of 12 seconds between
18:55:07–20:14:55 UT. The bold black vertical lines represent
the four exposures of E2 raster, each 2(cid:48)(cid:48) wide, corresponding to

Article number, page 4 of 17

the white lines marked in panel C. In addition, the exact duration
of E2 is marked by the dashed black vertical lines in panel G.
From the light curve, we see that three intensity peaks occur in
quick succession at P2. This indicates dynamic events occurring
and are also captured by simultaneous EIS raster observations.
This gives us the opportunity for measuring the plasma param-
eters in the P2 region. Similarly, for E4 observations, there is
a partial overlap of EIS observations with the region having re-
peated intensity enhancement. However, no such spatial overlap
of EIS exposures with those of homologous intensity enhance-
ment is observed for E1 and E3.

3.4. Plasma Diagnostics with EIS

As stated earlier and shown in Fig. 1, the EIS spectrometer ob-
served the X-shaped region four times on 12th December 2014,
in raster mode. These are denoted as E1, E2, E3 and E4. We plot
the EIS intensity maps obtained in diﬀerent ionisation states of
Iron from Fe viii to Fe xv in Figs. 6 & 7 (as labelled). In these
maps, we emphasize the region between y=[-120(cid:48)(cid:48), 10(cid:48)(cid:48)], so as
to show the morphology of the loops near the X-region as well
as the loops beneath and above it, in detail. The four columns
in these two ﬁgures correspond to the four diﬀerent EIS rasters.
We have diﬀerentially rotated the FOVs of E2, E3 and E4 to the
raster start time of E1, to facilitate the time evolution study of

Fig. 3. Snapshots of events on December 12, 2014 showing formation of TELs and reformation of the loops belonging to individual ARs as a

the same region. The noticeable rightmost black stripes in E2,
E3 and E4 are due to this rotation. We locate the X-shaped re-
gion in all the intensity maps with a blue box, that encloses the
point ‘P’ shown in panel A of Fig. 4.

The intensity maps obtained at cooler temperatures, such as
in Fe viii and Fe x, show a number of distinct loops criss-crossing
each other (top and middle rows in Fig. 6). Similar structures are
also seen in the intensity images obtained in Fe xi (bottom row
of Fig. 6) and Fe xii (top row of Fig. 7) but with a signiﬁcant
amount of diﬀuse emission, similar to those observed by, for e.g.,
Tripathi et al. (2009); Subramanian et al. (2014). In the intensity
images obtained at higher temperatures (exceeding log T [K] =
6.20), we notice a decrease in the intensity in the X-shaped re-
gion. The region appears fully evacuated in the intensity maps of
Fe xiv and Fe xv for all the three rasters but E1 (bottom row of
Fig. 7). It is worth noticing that there is an abundance of bright
loops in the Fe xv intensity maps beneath the X-region.

To illustrate this better, we obtain light curves in ﬁve spec-
tral lines of Iron for all four EIS rasters and plot them in Fig. 8
as labelled. The top panels are the intensity maps in Fe xv and
bottom panels are the light curves. We obtain the light curves
by averaging the intensities within the two horizontal white lines
overplotted in the top panels. We have drawn the vertical blue
and black lines in the top and bottom panels, respectively, to
highlight the extent (in x-direction) of the X-shaped region and
the corresponding extent in the respective light curves.

The light curves (shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 8) re-
veal that the X-shaped region is dimmer in all the spectral lines

in all rasters, except E1, where Fe xv is brighter than other lines.
However, it shows a decrease in intensity where Fe x shows an
enhancement. Similar nature of light curves is noted for Fe xiv
(not shown here), albeit it is a weak line and has minor ﬂuctua-
tions in intensity as a function of position.

3.4.1. Density and Temperature diagnostics

Plasma diagnostics are conducted in several regions within the
EIS raster FOV, to discern the properties in diﬀerent types of
loop structures captured in the same. The average electron densi-
ties and temperatures have been estimated at the X-region along
with those in the adjacent loops for all four rasters. These are
denoted in Fig. 9 by ‘P’ (X-region), ‘L’ (TELs) and ‘D’ (hot
loops beneath the X-region) on the Fe xii 195 Å intensity map of
E2, rotated with respect to E1. In addition, for E2, we have the
fourth region of interest P2 which shows intermittent intensity
enhancements, as shown in panel G of Fig. 5.

3.4.1.1. Assessment of background/foreground
Estimate of background/ foreground emission plays an impor-
tant role in measuring plasma electron densities and tempera-
tures (Del Zanna & Mason 2003; Tripathi et al. 2011). For this,
we identify a region marked as ‘B’ in Fig. 9. The average inten-
sity in ‘B’ is assumed to be the background/ foreground intensity.
The green box in Fig. 9 is the zoomed-in ROI and correspond to
the ROI that is shown in Figs. 6 and 7.

Fig. 4. Panel (A): The TELs seen in AIA 193 Å channel in pixel coordinates at a given instant belonging to EIS raster E2. The white lines are the
slits, marked as ‘H’ and ‘V’ and the point ‘P’ (‘*’, in blue) denotes the intersection. Panels (B) and (C): The intensity ﬂuctuations along the slits
‘V’ and ‘H’ respectively in the xt plots. The over-plotted solid black lines indicate the EIS raster durations, with numbers ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘E3’ and ‘E4’
indicating the respective raster number. The dashed-dotted blue lines track the displacement of plasma with time. The black dashed line shows the
position of the point ‘P’ in pixel coordinates.

The averaged intensities for locations P, P2, L, D and B are
noted in Table 2. We note that the averaged intensities in Mg vii
and Si vii in ‘B’ region larger than the actual locations which
are considered for the estimates. Similar discrepancy is noted
for Fe xiv line. We attribute this to the weak spectral lines and
therefore, discard these three lines for any kind of plasma diag-
nostic studies. In addition, we note that for diﬀerent locations
for diﬀerent rasters, the average intensities in ‘B’ exceed those
in the other three regions. This renders most of the low temper-
ature lines viz., Fe viii, Fe ix, Fe x and Fe xi unsuitable for the
EM-loci computation. That leaves only a set of four lines Fe xii
192 Å and 195 Å, Fe xiii and Fe xv only. Therefore, we neglect
the background/ foreground correction for EM-loci plots for all
three (four) regions, ‘P’, ‘L’, and ‘D’ (and ‘P2’ in case of E2).

3.4.1.2. Density diagnostics in the X-region
Using the average intensities in ‘B’ in Fig. 9 as the background/
foreground values, we derive the density maps for Fe xii and
Fe xiii line pairs (refer to Fig. 10) for all four raster periods. Note
that these maps show background subtracted densities. The four
columns represent the four diﬀerent rasters as labelled. The over-
plotted white-box in each map highlights the X-shaped structure

(same location as the blue boxes in Figs. 6 & 7). It is further
noted that these boxes enclose the point ‘P’, shown in panel A
of Fig. 4. We neglect deriving density maps obtained using Fe xi
and Fe xiv, since these are noisy. This is because of one of the
lines of Fe xi, i.e. 180.401 Å is at the edge of CCD A where the
eﬀective aperture area is small; and Fe xiv lines have small signal
to noise ratios as they are weak.

The average densities within the X-shaped regions (enclosed
by white boxes) for all four rasters using the Fe xii (similar for
Fe xiii) lines range between log Ne = 8.46 to 8.67 cm−3 (also
see, Table 3). To check the consistency of our results, we com-
pared these densities by obtaining the averaged spectra within
the white box before taking the ratios. The density estimates
were similar to those listed in Table 3. In addition, the density at
the identiﬁed brightening observed by EIS slits, i.e., P2 is log Ne
= 8.50 in Fe xii, which is consistent with the average values in
the X-region.

3.4.1.3. Temperature diagnostics in the X-region
We estimate the temperature of the X-shaped region, which is
shown by blue boxes in Figs. 6 & 7, using the Emission Mea-
sure (EM) loci curves (Jordan & Wilson 1971; Tripathi et al.

2010). For this purpose, we ﬁrst obtain the averaged intensities
in the region in all the spectral lines marked with ‘t’ in Table 1.
However, we exclude Si vii, for reasons explained in §3.4.1.1. To
compute the EM we have used coronal abundances of Schmelz
et al. (2012) and standard ionization equilibrium given by CHI-
ANTI (Dere et al. 1996; Del Zanna et al. 2015). The obtained
EM-loci curves for all four rasters in the X-region are shown in
Fig. 11. We have also plotted the histograms of number of cross-
ings of EM curves within a temperature bin of log T [K] = 0.1
in the respective panels. In all the four plots, the left y-axis de-
note the EM values, whereas the right y-axis represents number
of crossings in each temperature bin.

The EM-loci curves along with the histograms suggest that
the plasma within the X-shaped structure (enclosing the point
P) during E2 is nearly isothermal with temperature within
log T [K] = 6.10–6.20. In contrast, for E3 we note that the
plasma is more multi-thermal in nature, with the histogram peak-
ing between log T [K] = 6.10–6.30. The average temperatures in
the X-region for all four rasters are noted in in Table 3.

For the P2-region, the EM-loci curves are shown in Fig. 12.
It reveals that the peak formation temperature ranges between
log T [K] = 6.20–6.30 (refer to Table 3), which is somewhat
larger than that noted in the X-region.

3.4.1.4. Plasma density and temperature diagnostics in the
adjacent loops
It is imperative to have a comparison of the electron densi-
ties and temperatures in the X-region (the point P is contained
in this region) with those at the adjacent loops. Therefore, in
Fig. 9 we have identiﬁed two additional regions- one on the
TELs (shown in blue and identiﬁed as ‘L’) and other at the loops
belonging to the active region in the southern hemisphere (shown
in black, identiﬁed as ‘D’) of the X-region. The background is
Fe xii 195 Å intensity map corresponding to E2. The average
densities obtained at L, in most cases, is higher than those ob-
tained at P. The former, in turn, is always less than those in D
(see Table 3). We note that densities in the TELs obtained here
using Fe xii lines is about an order of magnitude lower than those
obtained by Liu et al. (2011) using the line ratios of Si x observed
by CDS.
In Fig. 13, we also plot the EM Loci curves obtained for lo-
cations L and D for E2 raster period. The plots show that the
plasma at location D is more multi-thermal than location L. We
further note that the temperature for TELs and loops correspond-
ing to the active region in the southern hemisphere are some-
what higher (and more multi-thermal) than those obtained P i.e.,
within the X-shaped region (see Table 3). The temperatures ob-

tained for locations L and D are in agreement with those ob-
tained for TELs by Sheeley et al. (1975); Delannée & Aulanier
(1999); Glover et al. (2003); Pevtsov (2004); Balasubramaniam
et al. (2005). This temperature range is maintained throughout
the four rasters.

3.4.2. Doppler velocities and Spectral Line Width

We obtain the Doppler velocity and line width maps correspond-
ing to the X-region for all four rasters in Fe xii, Fe xiii and Fe xv.
The maps are displayed in Figs. 14 & 15. The four columns rep-
resent the four EIS rasters. The over-plotted white (black) boxes
in Doppler (line width) maps correspond to the blue boxes in
Figs. 6 & 7, enclosing the X-shaped structure.

The Doppler velocity maps for Fe xii and Fe xiii are very sim-
ilar. During the second raster E2, when the region is closest to
the disk center, the X-shaped region shows dominant redshifts of
∼5–8 km s−1. On the contrary, during rasters E1 and E3, the same
region shows predominant blueshifts of ∼10 km s−1. For the
raster E4 when the active regions is farthest from the disk center,
the LOS velocities are predominantly upﬂows (∼5–8 km s−1). At
higher temperature mapped by Fe xv line, a signiﬁcant fraction
of the pixels is observed to have blueshifts (E1), redshifts (E2,
E3) and very close to zero (E4) velocities. The average Doppler
velocities in the box region are noted in Table 3. Taking into ac-

count an uncertainty of ∼5 km s−1 in EIS velocity measurements
(see e.g., Young et al. 2012), we note that the direction of plasma
ﬂows along the LOS do not change.

The line width maps shown in Fig. 15 are essentially the Full-
Width-Half-Maxima (FWHM) obtained after subtracting the in-
strumental width (56 mÅ; Doschek et al. 2008). In all the maps,
the loops at the bottom have relatively higher FWHMs, but
are best identiﬁed in Fe xii. The FWHMs obtained within the
box is ∼0.03 Å for Fe xii and Fe xiii lines, for all four rasters
(see, Table 3), which is equivalent to the non-thermal veloc-
ity of ∼27 km s−1. To derive the non-thermal velocities, we
have used the temperature in the X-region to be around 1.6 MK
(log T [K] = 6.20) as was obtained using the EM-Loci proce-
dure in 3.4.1.3. However, there are a few individual pixels with
FWHM as large as 0.068 Å with an equivalent non-thermal ve-
locity of ∼ 62 km s−1.

The Fe xv line has an average FWHM of ∼0.048 Å
(∼30 km s−1) in X-shaped structure for all four rasters. There are
pixels within the box, where the FWHM is as large as 0.18 Å,
which is equivalent to 115 km s−1 (assuming log T [K] = 6.2).

The average Doppler velocity and non-thermal width in P2
region are also noted in Table 3 and seen to be fairly similar to
those in the X-region (within the error limits). In addition, the
other plasma parameters in P2 (averages) are similar to those

represents the reconnection region, for all events.

4. Summary and Conclusions

This piece of study combines observations recorded by the AIA
and the HMI on-board SDO and EIS on-board Hinode to study
the formation, dynamics and plasma parameters of the trans-
equatorial loops (TELs). The TELs were observed between pre-
existing AR 12230 in the southern hemisphere and the newly
emerging AR 12234 in the northern hemisphere. We have per-
formed a comprehensive study of the evolution of TELs us-
ing AIA observations. The physical plasma parameters such as
density, temperature, Doppler and non-thermal velocities in the
loops as well as the interaction region between those loops are
studied using EIS spectroscopic observations.

The observations recorded by AIA reveal that initially, loops
belonging to the individual ARs evolve. These loops come closer
to each other and form the X-shaped topology, leading to the for-
mation of the TELs. This is highlighted in Fig. 3 and is sugges-
tive of the occurrence of the process of magnetic reconnection.
The xt-plots in Fig. 4 show that the inﬂow speed for the recon-
nection is 1–2 km s−1 whereas the outﬂow speed is ∼2 km s−1.
These values are in close comparison to that of Yokoyama et al.
(2001); Liu et al. (2011) in a ﬂaring TEL system (∼5 km s−1).
However, we note that these are projected velocities measured
in the plane-of-the-sky, hence gives the lower limit on the esti-
mates.

The intensity maps corresponding to the four EIS raster pe-
riods are derived using various spectral lines formed between

log T [K] = 5.80–6.35. At lower temperatures, corresponding to
Fe viii to Fe x, the X-region is seen very clearly with the adjacent
loops being very bright. The intensity images of Fe xii (formed
at log T [K] ≤ 6.20), show bright X-regions whereas at Fe xv
(log T [K] = 6.35), the X-region appears to be ﬁlled with plasma
at E1 but completely void at E2 and partially ﬁlled at E3 and
E4. Such darkening at the reconnection site has been attributed
to density diminution (Delannée & Aulanier 1999; Tripathi et al.
2007; Sun et al. 2015). This result is reinforced by plotting the
light curves in Fig. 8. Yokoyama et al. (2001) reported similar
voids in soft X-ray observations of magnetic reconnection events
leading to ﬂares.

Within the X-region for all the four EIS raster periods, the
electron densities are maintained steadily at log Ne = 8.46 to
8.67 cm−3 for the Fe xii and Fe xiii lines. The EM-Loci curves
suggest that the plasma is very nearly isothermal at log T [K] =
6.20 (i.e. 1.6 MK) within the X-region, which is somewhat
larger than those reported by Liu et al. (2011) at the cusp re-
gion (1.3 MK). However, Sun et al. (2015) found higher tem-
peratures, between 1–5 MK at the magnetic reconnection site
between TELs, but with an associated ﬂare. Also, there are hints
of multithermality of plasma in the X-region at E3.

High cadence observations, at an interval of 12 seconds, fur-
ther, reveal intermittent brightenings occurring close to the X-
region (marked as P2 in Fig. 5). Coincidentally, such brighten-
ings occurring during E2 phase of EIS raster observation were

captured exactly by four exposures. This gave us the opportunity
to understand the plasma parameters in this brightening point.
Density estimates at P2 show that it has an intermediate value
for Fe xii line. Further, the plasma at P2 has slightly higher tem-
perature, log T [K] = 6.20–6.30. We emphasize that we have not
incorporated background/foreground emission for temperature
estimates for reasons explained in §3.4.1.1.

We have also compared the densities and temperatures ob-
tained in the X-region with those obtained in TELs and other
AR loops. The average electron densities in the TELs (location
L of Fig. 9) exceed those in the X-region for all the four rasters.
Similarly, the electron densities at location D is larger than those
in the TELs. However, the densities at L is noted to be lower by
an order of magnitude as reported by (see, e.g., Liu et al. 2011),
using the Si x line of CDS. We also ﬁnd that just beneath the

X-region, a set of loops persist at ∼2 MK and the TELs are at in-
termediate temperatures. Existence of such hot loops neighbour-
ing the X-region has also been reported by Delannée & Aulanier
(1999); Glover et al. (2003); Pevtsov (2004); Balasubramaniam
et al. (2005), though in the presence of eruptive events like ﬂares
or coronal mass ejections. The peak formation temperature in
the loops belonging to the ARs individually is similar to that ob-
tained at P2.

The Doppler velocity maps show a mixture of upﬂows and
downﬂows for the comparatively cooler spectral lines in the X-
region. Near the disk center position, Fe xii, Fe xiii and Fe xv
show strong downﬂows but a mixture of zero velocities and
blueshifts away from the center. These ﬂows are ∼5–8 km s−1
upﬂows/downﬂows depending on the raster period. We note that
the loops emanating from the reconnection show similar mag-
nitude of Doppler velocities. With oﬀ-limb observations, Harra
et al. (2003); Brosius (2006); Liu et al. (2011) have also reported
similar bidirectional ﬂows in such loops. The on-disk LOS ve-
locities form the third mutually orthogonal component to the out-
ﬂow speeds at the X-region noted above.

In the X-region, the average FWHM is 0.03 Å which trans-
lates to about 27 km s−1 with the maximum being ∼ 62 km s−1
(corresponding to the brightest pixels) for Fe xii and Fe xiii.
However, for Fe xv, the X-region show a FWHM of ∼0.05 Å
translating to ∼30 km s−1 whereas the maximum is 0.18 Å,
equivalent to ∼115 km s−1. It is interesting to note that in case

of Fe xv, the enhanced FWHM region coincides with the dark
X-region in intensity map. We note that the non-thermal veloc-
ities are obtained considering the temperature of the X-region
(log T [K] = 6.20). The Doppler velocities and FWHM in P2 re-
gion is also comparable to those in the X-region. We highlight
that the temperatures used for these estimates are representative
of electron temperature of the plasma which can be considerably
diﬀerent than ion temperatures. This is particularly true in re-
gions undergoing magnetic reconnection where equilibrium con-
ditions are no longer valid. Considering that the ion temperatures
are generally larger than the electron temperatures, it is apparent
that the non-thermal velocities are somewhat overestimated here
(Seely et al. 1997; Tu et al. 1998; Landi 2007).

The results obtained based on the xt-plots derived using the
AIA observations combined with those from the EIS suggests
that the TELs formed through the process of reconnection at
the X-region formed between the two active regions. This study,
for the ﬁrst time, provides measurements of plasma parameters
such as electron density, temperature, Doppler shifts as well as
non-thermal velocities at X-region. We interpret that this is an
example of homologous low-intensity magnetic reconnections
occurring in TELs where the energy released is predominantly
used in plasma ﬂows and as kinetic energy source for the ﬁeld
lines snapping away and getting reoriented in some other direc-
tion. The intensity increment observed in AIA 193 Å images is
very small but not accompanied by any ﬂares or coronal mass

ejections, unlike those reported by Khan & Hudson (2000); Bal-
asubramaniam et al. (2005). It is plausible that such small-scale
reconnections of TELs steadily keep feeding energy into the so-
lar corona, thereby being a source of heating. However, further
studies are required to conﬁrm how frequent such loop systems
are in the solar atmosphere in a given time interval and estima-
tion of energy released by them. The physical plasma parameters
obtained in this study may provide constraints for MHD simula-
tions of magnetic reconnections in future.
