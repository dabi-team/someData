Abstract 
In this research, the effect of Magnesium Fluoride (MgF2) Anti-Reflection (AR) layer was investigated in quantum 
dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). MgF2 nanoparticles with the dominant size of 20 nm were grown by a thermal 
evaporation  method  and  a  thin  layer  was  formed  on  the  front  side  of  the  fluorine-doped  tin  oxide  (FTO) 
substrate. In order to study the effect of the AR layer on the efficiency of solar cells, this substrate was utilized 
in CdS QDSCs. In this conventional structure of QDSC, TiO2 nanocrystals (NCs) were applied on the FTO substrate, 
and then it was sensitized with CdS quantum dots (QDs). According to the results, the QDSCs with MgF2 AR layer 
represented the maximum Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of 3%. This efficiency was increased by about 47% 
compared to the reference cell without the AR layer. The reason is attributed to the presence of the AR layer 
and the reduction of incident light reflected from the surface of the solar cell. 

Keywords: QDSCs, MgF2 anti-reflection layer, CdS QDs, Energy conversion efficiency. 

1. Introduction 
Solar energy is one of the cleanest and most accessible sources of energy, especially in areas with high annual 
solar radiation emissions [1-4]. So, it could be a suitable replacement for fossil fuels. Several technologies have 
been applied to convert solar photons into electricity. Among these solar cells are the devices to directly convert 
sunlight  into  electricity  via  the  photoelectric  effect  [5-7].  QDSCs  are  one  of  the  most  promising  types  of 
nanostructure solar cells which have been studied here and in order recent research due to some of the most 
important parameters; these include good optical properties and high absorption coefficient in semiconductor 
QDs [8,9]. The corresponding laboratory efficiency of QDSCs is lower in reality than in theory [10]. In the past 
years several studies have been performed on different components in order to improve the performance of 
the  QDSCs.  This  research  includes  applying  a  different  structure  of  TiO2  as  the  scaffold  [11-13],  different 
semiconductor QDs  [14,15],  electrolyte  [16]  and the  counter  electrode  [17,18]. Moreover,  in  a  solar  cell the 
percentage of  sunlight emitted is reflected which  reduces the density of the  generated current from photon 
radiation. So, another possibility to further increase the performance of QDSCs is to optimize the usage of the 
incident light. So far, the use of an AR layer has been used in silicon solar cells [19-23]. In order to overcome this 
problem,  various techniques  have  been  proposed  to increase optical absorption.  One of  the  most important 
techniques is to apply an AR coating [21,24,25]. The AR coatings are one of the most important components for 
reducing  reflection  from  the  surface;  therefore,  they  are  widely  used  in  solar  cells,  lenses,  and  other 
optoelectronic devices [26-28]. 
As the solar cells are to be used in the air (n=1), in a case of glass where n=1.5, the material required for the AR 
should have an n~1.24. Such a material suitable for coating is not available, and so generally MgF2 with n=1.38 
is used which reduces the value of reflection from a single surface [29-31]. MgF2 is a technically very important 
low index material in UV-VUV optical coating applications due to its high transparency and low optical loss in 
this wavelength range [31,32]. Therefore, MgF2 can be used as an appropriate choice as an AR layer in solar cells. 
The most important parameters in the application of the AR layer are the number and the thickness of them 
rather than depending on the range of wavelengths that needs to be covered; the number of AR layers can be

variable. But typically the AR coating is fabricated by using a single layer coating of a material, or a doubled layer 
of two selected materials [33-35]. 
The current work describes MgF2 composed of a single layer that has been chosen to prepare the AR layer in a 
standard structure of QDSCs for the first time. In the following a layer with about 8µm thickness of TiO2 NCs with 
a dominant size of 20 nm was hydrothermally grown and deposited on FTO-glass substrates. CdS NCs were also 
applied for the sensitization of photoanodes utilizing the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) 
method. The photoelectrode with a MgF2 AR layer demonstrated the maximum PCE of about 3%. This efficiency 
was increased by about 47% compared to that of the reference cell sensitized without the AR layer. 

2. Experimental 
2.1. Coating of MgF2 nanoparticles 
In this research as the first step we needed to insure proper adhesion of the films. FTO coated glass substrates 
were cleaned with acetone and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. The outer surfaces of transparent substrates were 
then coated with a thin layer of MgF2 nanoparticles by a thermal evaporation method under a base pressure of 
1×10-5 mBar. The substrate temperature was varied from ambient temperature to a maximum value of 200°C. 
The evaporation rate was maintained constant at 3 Å/s with a reaction time of about 15 minutes. 

Figure 1. (a,b) Surface FESEM images of the composed layer of MgF2 nanoparticles under two different 
magnifications. The size distribution histogram of the MgF2 nanoparticles is shown in the inset of (b). 

In  addition to  the thermal  evaporation  [36,37], various deposition  methods  have  been applied  for  preparing 
MgF2 thin films including Ion beam sputtering [38], e-beam evaporation [39], sol-gel processing [40], Ion-Beam 
Assisted Deposition (IBAD) [41], Plasma Ion Assisted Deposition (PIAD) [42]. 

3. Result and discussion 
3.1. Coating of MgF2 nanoparticles 
In Figure 1(a,b) a surface Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) view of a MgF2 thin film is shown in two different 
magnifications. The homogeneous film consists of globular grains with diameters between 18 nm and 35 nm, as 
shown  inset  of  Figure  1(b).  Figure  1(a)  shows  that  the  substrate  surface  is  completely  covered  with  MgF2 
nanoparticles.

Figure 2. X-ray diffraction (a) and EDX (b) patterns of MgF2 composed layer. 

The crystalline phase of the MgF2 nanoparticles layer can be detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as presented in 
Figure 2(a). The positions of XRD peaks of the MgF2 films, which are observed at 41.05o, 61.83o, 84.16o and 89.16o 
confirm the tetragonal crystal structures of the deposited MgF2 films. The obtained peaks were matched with 
ICSD cards No. 01-072-2231 correspond to the (221), (110), (220) and (111).  
The grain size (D, nm) of the MgF2 films was calculated from the main intensity peak with the following Scherer 
equation [43]: 

D =

(0.9 × λ)
(βCOSθ)

                         (1) 

where β is the Full Width at Half Maxima (FWHM), θ is the Bragg angle and λ is the wavelength of incident X-ray 
(Cr Kα, 0.229 nm in the present case). It is well known that the Scherer formula is a good approximation for a 
spherical crystal; the size is inversely proportional to the FWHM [44]. By the use of the Scherer formula for (221) 
plane, the average grain size of 22 nm for a MgF2 film was confirmed. 
Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis has been used to investigate the elemental components 
of the anti-reflection layer. As seen in Figure 2(b), the intensities of the peaks show the formation of both Mg 
and Flor atoms as the main element in the EDX pattern. The atomic composition is also calculated and shown in 
inset of Figure 2(b). 
To  analyze  the  quality  of  the  produced  MgF2  composed  layer,  the  optical  properties  have  been  considered. 
Figure  3(a)  shows  the  measured  transmittance  spectra  of  the  single-layer  MgF2  films  deposited  on  a  glass 
substrate  that  are  compared  with  the  spectra  of  uncoated  glass  samples.  As  a  result,  there  is  no  noticeable 
change in the transmittance rate of light from either the uncoated glass or MgF2 coated glass in the wavelength 
range of 300 nm to 1000 nm; this indicates that the MgF2 composed layer is as transparent as the glass. 
The diffuse reflectance spectra of the MgF2 layer is also  shown in Figure 3(b). As we can see, the results are 
matched with the transmission spectra. According to the spectra, the level of reflection from the uncoated glass 
surface is about 4%, while the level for the MgF2 layer has been reduced to less than 1%. This result shows the 
suitable optical performance of the MgF2 AR layer.

In many optical devices there are several levels of separation demonstrating that the loss of intensity resulting 
from reflections can be serious [45]. For example, for the near-vertical radiation, the surface reflection from the 
crystal glass (in the air) is: 

R(cid:2929) = R(cid:2926) = (cid:3428)

(cid:2870)
(cid:3432)

1.5 + 1

(cid:2870)
(cid:3432)

= 0.04                    (2) 

So for incident light, there is about 4% reflection, which will reach 6% for a flint glass with a refractive index of 
1.67. 
But  in  this  work    for a  glass  with  a refractive  index of  1.5  and  a specific thickness  of the  MgF2  AR layer,  the 
magnitude of the reflection will be significantly reduced by the following equation: 

∆= 2n(cid:2916)t cos θ(cid:4593) → 2n(cid:2916)t = 1

2(cid:3415) λ → t =

                     (4) 

Since n(cid:2916) = 1.38 and  n(cid:2916) = 1.5 , the reflectivity is reduced from 4% to 1.3%. 
All three transmission, reflection and absorption coefficients have to be considered. In the above destructive 
interference, according to the expected calculations, the reflection has significantly decreased. 
According to the conservation of energy and the following formula: 

A + T + R = 1                               (5) 

By measuring the transmission and the small changes observed in Figure 3(a), a part of the radiation is absorbed 
and resulted in increasing the efficiency of the solar cell.

Figure 4. The 3-Dimensional AFM image of the MgF2 AR layer. 

An  atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM)  image  of  the  MgF2  composed  layer  has  been  taken  to  measure  surface 
topography of the layer (Figure 4). The typical root-mean-square roughness (Rq) and the average roughness of 
the layer were found at 87.993 nm and 87.91 nm, respectively. According to the average roughness, it could be 
observed that the MgF2 surface layer was uniformly applied. This low-level roughness reduces the scattering of 
incident light to the surface. It does not create an imbalance in the performance of the solar cell which may also 
improve it. 

2.2. Fabrication of CdS quantum dot sensitized solar sells 
In this research, the photoanode includes TiO2 nanoparticles as a scaffold and CdS QDs as sensitizers. So, TiO2 
NCs were synthesized by a hydrothermal method in acidic autoclaving PH with a Titanium Tetraisopropoxide 
(TTIP) precursor as described in our previous work [46]. Then the paste is prepared using TiO2 nanoparticles and 
is deposited by the doctor blade method on the top surface of the FTO substrate. The layer was finally heated 
at 325, 375, 450, and 500°C for about 5, 5, 15, and 15 min to achieve a pure nanocrystalline TiO2 layer. This layer 
is identified as the H1(2) layer. 

Figure 5. Schematic of application of the anti-reflection layer in the quantum dot sensitized solar cell. 

The deposition of CdS QDs in situ on TiO2 films is done by the SILAR method. For this deposition, the TiO2 film 
was immersed in 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2.2H2O methanol solution and 0.1 M Na2S.9H2O water/methanol solution 
for 1 minute, followed by rinsing with methanol and then drying. This process was repeated over six cycles as 
we reported earlier [47]. This layer is also identified as the H1(2)/CdS layer.  
In this work, CuS NCs are used as a counter electrode that was prepared through a SILAR process by using 0.5 M 
Cu(NO3)2 in ethanol and 0.5 M Na2S.9H2O in ethanol/DI water solutions. The deposition was carried out to form 
a black layer of CuS on the surface of FTO glass substrates.

A polysulfide electrolyte solution including 1 M Na2S.9H2O, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl was also used. Figure 5 shows 
the  location  of  the  anti-reflection  layer  as  well  as  its  application  in  the  quantum  dot,  sensitized  solar  cell, 
schematically. 

2.3. Characterizations 
All SEM images were taken using a TeScan–Mira III.EDX measurements of the photoanodes were also verified 
using a T-Scan field emission electron microscope. XRD patterns were measured by Philips Xpert-pro equipment 
with  Kr  Kα  (λ=  2.29°A)  radiation.  Optical  spectroscopies  were  carried  out  using  a  Mecasys  Optizen  POP 
spectrophotometer.  The  current-voltage characteristics  were  verified  under  AM 1.5, 100 mW/cm2  simulated 
sun-light irradiation. The incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) was also measured by a Sharif 
solar IPCE system.

sectional SEM image of TiO2 NCs layer. The inset of Figure 6(a) shows the diameter histogram of the TiO2 
NCs. 

3.2. CdS sensitized solar cells 
A  top-view  SEM  image  of  TiO2  nanoparticles-composed  layer  is  shown  in  Figure  6(a).  The  size  distribution 
histogram of these NCs is also shown in the inset of this Figure. It could be observed that hydrothermally grown 
TiO2 nanoparticles with a dominate size of 20 nm are uniformly deposited on the FTO substrate. It can be seen 
also, that the morphology of nanocrystalline semiconductor TiO2 is almost spherical in shape, and also the TiO2 
layer is porous that can enhance the number of QD sensitizers attached to the photoanode surface. Figure 6(b) 
demonstrates the top-view SEM image of the CdS sensitized TiO2 NCs layer through the SILAR process after 6 
cycles of  deposition. According  to this Figure,  the  surface of  the  TiO2 composed  layer  is covered  by  a round-
shape of CdS NCs. The thicknesses of the TiO2 NCs layer (H1(2) layer) is also clarified in Figure 6(c) and measured 
about 8 µm.

Figure 7. X-ray diffraction patterns of the nanocrystalline H1(2) layer before and after the deposition of CdS 
QDs. 

Figure 7 represents the X-ray diffraction pattern of the H1(2) layer before and after CdS sensitization. As can be 
seen, the crystalline planes associated with the H1(2) layer in Figure 7(a) correspond to the anatase phase and 
belong to the standard JCPDS file No. 71.1169. The X-ray diffraction peaks are located at 2θ of 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.2°, 
53.9°, 55.1°,  62.7°,  68.7°,  and 75°,  for  TiO2  nanoparticles.  These  peaks  correspond  to  the  (101), (004),  (220), 
(105), (211), (204), (116), and (215) crystalline planes of the anatase phase of titanium dioxide. After deposition 
of CdS quantum dots these peaks were detected at 2θ of 26.65°, 43.98°, 52.25°, and 70.38°. According to JCPDS 
file No. 41.1049, these peaks are related to the (002), (110), (103) and (211) crystalline planes of the hexagonal 
phase of CdS. This plan shows that the CdS quantum dots are well deposited on the surface of the H1(2) layer. 

Figure 8. EDX spectra and elemental compositions of the TiO2/CdS layer. 

The composition of the CdS QDs deposited photoelectrode was determined by the EDX. According to Figure 8, 
Ti, O, Cd and S were detected, and their concentrations are shown by weight. These results confirmed that the 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
CdS QDs had been deposited on the TiO2 NCs layer. The EDX analysis demonstrates the purity of the sample 
because there is no impurity detected in Figure 8. Furthermore, the quantitate analysis shown in the inset of the 
Figure demonstrates the atomic composition of 23.6% Ti, 58.5% O, 10% Cd, and 7.8% S. 
The optical properties of CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 NCs photoelectrode is studied with UV-vis transmittance and 
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy as shown in Figure 9. So, Figure 9(a) presents the optical transmittance of the 
H1(2) layer before and after CdS sensitization over 200-1000 nm wavelength. It could be seen that the TiO2 NCs 
layer with transparency of about 80% is highly transparent between 400 and 1100 nm. Nevertheless, after the 
deposition of CdS QDs, the value of transmission is considerably decreased to about 40% for the H1(2)/CdS layer. 
The absorption edge of the H1(2)/CdS is shifted to about 515 nm. This is due to the deposited CdS QDs on the 
surface of the H1(2) layer and the absorption edge is close to the bandgap energy of  bulk CdS material. The 
diffuse reflectance spectra of fabricated photoelectrodes is also shown in Figure 9(b). This was performed in 
order to better determine the absorption edge of the electrode before and after the  deposition of CdS QDs. 
Considering the diffuse reflectance spectra result, we conclude that the absorption edge starts at 500 nm for 
the  two  photoelectrodes.  However,  the  corresponding  values  of  diffuse  reflectance  are  increased  after  the 
deposition of CdS QDs. 

Figure 9. Transmittance (a) and diffuse reflectance (b) spectra of H1(2) and H1(2)/CdS photoanodes. 

Finally, the photocurrent density-voltage characteristics of the cells were measured for the investigation of solar 
cells application and are shown in Figure 10(a). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are also calculated 
and shown in Table 1. In this research, the H1(2)/CdS were selected as the reference photoanodes to show the 
effect  of  the  MgF2  AR  layer  on  the  performance  of  the  CdS  QDSCs.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  the  photovoltaic 
parameters of the reference cell such as short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor 
(FF) and conversion efficiency (η) are about 7.81 mA/cm2, 558 mV, 0.47 and 2.05%, respectively. After deposition 
of the MgF2 AR layer, these values are increased to 11.48 mA/cm2, 620 mV, 0.42, and 3%. According to the result, 
an increase of about 47% is obvious in the short-circuit current density. It is because of the presence of the AR 
layer and reduction of incident light reflected from the surface of the solar cell.

efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the QDSCs with and without the MgF2 AR layer. 

The investigation of the effect of the AR coating layer is further analyzed using IPCE measurements. Figure 10(b) 
shows the IPCE curves obtained for the QDSSCs fabricated with and without the MgF2 AR coating layer. All the 
IPCE curves have a maximum of around 500 nm around the absorption edge of CdS QDs. The highest IPCE value 
is shown by the QDSSC fabricated with the MgF2 AR layer (62%) and without the AR layer the lowest value is 
apparent (55.8%). This result could confirm the data of J-V measurements as were reported in Figure 10(a). The 
high value of IPCE supports the observation that the cell with the AR layer has excellent performance.

4. Conclusion 
Herein, we have demonstrated the MgF2 AR thin film by a thermal evaporation process. Besides, based on the 
SEM  images  and  EDX  analyses,  the  modified  deposition  was  uniformly  performed.  The  morphology,  optical 
properties and the key role of the MgF2 AR layer in CdS QDSCs were investigated. According to the result, the 
transparent MgF2 layer showed suitable optical performance that resulted in increasing the efficiency of CdS 
QDSCs. Moreover, the photovoltaic performances of as-prepared TiO2/CdS photoanodes with an AR layer were 
investigated,  and  the  results  showed  that  this  electrode  exhibited  higher  performance  than  that  of  pure 
electrode.  According  to  the  results,  the  CdS-sensitized  solar  cell  with  a  MgF2  AR  layer  demonstrated  the 
photovoltaic parameters of Jsc=11.48 mA/cm2, Voc=620 mV and efficiency of 3%. This efficiency was increased 
about 47% compared to the reference cell without the AR layer. The reason was attributed to the formation of 
an anti-reflection film to reduce the incident light reflection from the surface of the cell.
