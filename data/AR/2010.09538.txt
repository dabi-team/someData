Electron-stimulated desorption (ESD) of cryosorbed molecules on surfaces is a process of relevance to ﬁelds
as varied as vacuum dynamics in accelerators and astrochemistry. While desorption from such molecular
systems induced by keV electrons and fast ions has been extensively studied, the sub-keV electron regime is
comparatively little known. We measured and quantiﬁed electron-stimulated desorption from molecular ice
systems (layers of N2, CO, CO2, Ar and H2O/D2O condensed at cryogenic temperatures) in the 150-2000
eV electron energy range. In this regime stopping power is no longer suﬃcient to explain the electron energy
dependence of ESD yields. We introduce the notion of desorption-relevant depth, which characterizes the
transition between two energy deposition regimes near the surface. We then apply this notion to the
diﬀerent systems, showing how ESD in the sub-keV regime can for example reveal the diﬀerences in species
diﬀusion in crystalline and porous amorphous CO2 ices.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Electron-stimulated desorption (ESD) is one of the
oldest phenomena observed in vacuum science and has
long been studied in the view of mitigating its impact in
the deterioration of vacuum1,2. Later more fundamen-
tal surface science studies of ESD were made to deter-
mine how the electronic excitations resulting from in-
elastic scattering of the incident electrons could convert
to desorption, within the more general ﬁeld of study of
desorption induced by electronic transitions (DIET)3–5.
Studies of DIET phenomena still have important ap-
plications today in vacuum dynamics, in accelerators
where synchrotron radiation creates energetic photons
and electrons hitting the chamber walls6,7. Electron-
stimulated desorption in particular is ampliﬁed by elec-
tron cloud eﬀects8.
In accelerators operated at cryo-
genic temperature, such as the LHC (Large Hadron
Collider), the chamber walls are covered by molecules
cryosorbed from the residual gas. These adsorbed
molecules should change signiﬁcantly the non-thermal
desorption properties of the chamber walls. Some ex-
periments were made previously on photon-stimulated
desorption9 and electron-stimulated desorption10 from
cryosorbed gases with the aim to provide data to prop-
erly model vacuum behaviour in cryogenic instruments.
DIET phenomena also ﬁnd applications in seemingly
unrelated ﬁelds like astrochemistry. In cold and dense
regions of the interstellar medium, where stars and plan-
ets are born, molecules condense from the gas phase
or directly form on submicrometer-sized dust grains.
These molecules and grains are exposed to irradiation
from cosmic rays and stellar UV and X-rays, as well as
from secondary photons and electrons of these primary
sources. Non-thermal desorption induced by these var-
ious sources of energy regulate the exchanges between

yields, but also a better fundamental understanding of
non-thermal desorption processes, are necessary to the
contexts where DIET phenomena are of relevance. The
present study focuses on electron-stimulated desorption
from molecular ices, i.e. on the high coverage regime
where multiple layers of molecules are cryosorbed.
We provide quantiﬁed data in the 150-2000 eV range,
but we also aim to obtain more insights into some
fundamental aspects of ESD, most notably to explain
the electron energy dependence of desorption yields.
studied include molecules commonly
The systems
found both in the residual gas of vacuum systems and
at the surface of grains in the interstellar medium or
other icy astrophysical objects (CO, CO2, H2O), as
well as simpler molecular/atomic ices (N2, Ar) where
the absence of irradiation-induced chemistry allows to
study these more fundamental aspects of ESD.

Measurements of desorption by fast charged particles
are usually rationalized by assuming that the desorp-
tion yield is proportional to some power of the stopping
power for the particle-target couple considered. The
stopping power is a measure of the energy loss per unit
distance of a fast charged particle going through a given
target material. It depends on the mass, velocity and
charge of the particle as well as on the properties of the
material. Many experimental studies have been per-
formed to determine the relation between desorption
yields and stopping power for molecular ices (see e.g.
refs. 16–20 and references therein). Most of these have
been conducted with ions as projectiles, and sometimes
with keV electrons. The electron energy dependence in
the sub-keV regime has been comparatively little ex-
plored. Two studies to our knowledge report desorption
yield curves as a function of electron energies in this
range10,21. Ref. 10 does not expand on the physical
interpretation of the observed dependence. In ref. 21,
the energy deposition proﬁle of electrons in the ice is

 
 
 
 
 
 
described and used to explain the observed electron en-
ergy dependence of electron-induced chemistry in CO
ice. The results on electron-stimulated desorption are
however not discussed. Here it is our main goal to show
how accounting for the electron energy dependence of
ESD requires both the description of energy deposition
by electrons as a function of energy, but also the energy
and/or particle transport mechanisms that set which
layers of the ice can be involved in desorption. Such a
description therefore requires going beyond simple con-
siderations of stopping power.

II. METHODS

A. Experimental set-up

The Multisystem is a newly installed instrument at
CERN. The main chamber of the system is an ultra-
high vacuum mu-metal chamber pumped by a turbo-
molecular pump and a NEG (Non-Evaporable Getter)
cartridge. The base pressure achieved is 1 × 10−10 mbar
at room temperature and 2 × 10−11 mbar at 13 K. A
drawing of the chamber is shown in ﬁg. 1. At the cen-
ter is a cryomanipulator with movements in the XYZ
directions and rotation around the Z axis, cooled down
with liquid helium. At the tip is a sample holder the
upper part of which can be cooled down to about 13 K.
Flag-type samples (surface ∼ 2.7 cm2) can be inserted
in the sample holder. For the experiments presented
here the nature of the substrate sample is not consid-
ered important and its inﬂuence was not investigated.
We used a gold substrate for the experiments (> 1 µm
gold vacuum-evaporated on a Cr covered stainless steel
plate). The samples are kept electrically insulated by
a sapphire plate, which allows to measure the currents
produced by electron irradiation of, and electron emis-
sion from, the surface.

The chamber is equipped with an electron gun (Kim-
ball), with a theoretical electron energy range of 5 -
2000 eV. The measurements were carried out in the 150
- 2000 eV range. The beam was incident normal to the
surface. A phosphorus screen in the lower part of the
sample holder and two Faraday cups on the back were
used to characterize the electron beam. For each en-
ergy, the beam was set in order to obtain a clean spot
of about 0.1 cm2. The beam was checked to be gaus-
sian with the Faraday cups. The exception was that for
energies 1500 eV and more, the beam could no longer
be focused tightly enough to obtain the same conditions.
This resulted in larger and less well deﬁned spots, which
means measurements at these energies carry more un-
certainty.

The composition of the residual gas of the chamber
was monitored using a quadrupole mass spectrometer
(QMS, HiQuad), which is also used for the desorption
measurements.

In order to deposit condensed gas on the surface, an
injection system is used. Gas from an injection manifold

2

is brought into a closed, known volume where the pres-
sure is measured by a capacitance gauge. A microleak
valve is then used to let gas into the chamber through
a dosing tube, which can be brought very close (∼0.2
mm) to the surface so that most of the injected gas sticks
and the rest of the chamber is not contaminated. From
the QMS signal observed during ice deposition and us-
ing the calibration derived below, we estimated the ﬂux
leaking out of the substrate region during deposition to
be about 1% of the injected gas ﬂux. The base pressure
rises barely above 10−10 mbar when injecting several
hundred monolayers of ice. The investigated gases are
N2, CO, Ar, CO2, and H2O, as well as some isotopes of
these: 15N2, 13CO2 and D2O. For H2O and D2O, the
liquids in pyrex vials were degassed by several freeze-
pump-thaw cycles and the vapour pressure above the
liquid was let into the manifold for injection.

The amount of gas deposited is controlled by mon-
itoring the drop in pressure from the closed cali-
brated volume. The thickness of ice corresponding
to this deposited amount can be calibrated using the
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) method
within ∼ 10-20 % precision22. The TPD of N2 for dif-
ferent quantities of deposited gas on the substrate is
shown in ﬁg. 2. For this case the transition from a sub-
monolayer desorption regime to a multilayer regime is
clearly identiﬁed by distinct desorption peaks, with a
multilayer peak appearing at a temperature lower than
the monolayer peak for the high coverages. This signiﬁes
that the desorption energy of the multilayer molecules
is lower than the desorption energy of the monolayer
molecules bound to the substrate. The pressure drop
corresponding to the deposition of one monolayer can
then be inferred from these TPD curves to be approx-
imately 9 × 10−4 mbar. One can also notice the des-
orption signal above 40 K in ﬁg 2, which is due to des-
orption from other cold parts of the manipulator that
are progressively heated. This parasitic desorption does
not contribute to the actual TPD signal from the sur-
face. The thickness of ices for which the TPD method
does not allow such a clear identiﬁcation of the mono-
layer to multilayer transition (e.g. H2O) was estimated
from the N2 calibration, taking into account diﬀerences
in pumping speed.

One particularity of the set-up is the use of a
”molecule collector”, designed in the spirit of the so-
called ”Feulner cap”23, to increase the sensitivity of
the measurements.
The measurement of electron-
stimulated desorption involves measuring the increase
of partial pressure of the species of interest when bom-
barding the surface with the electron beam. The col-
lector is an L shaped tube attached to the ﬂange of the
chamber which leads to the QMS and into which the
manipulator can be inserted (see ﬁg. 1). The pump-
ing speed inside the collector is thus limited, with the
only apertures being the margin between the manipula-
tor and the collector entrance, and a small hole to allow
the electron beam to hit the sample inside. With the
pumping speed reduced, the increase of partial pressure

B. Measurement procedure

We wish to obtain the ESD yield, i.e.

the number
of ejected molecules or atoms per incident electron, as a
function of electron energy for a number of systems. For
this, a molecular ice is grown by the procedure explained
previously. The cryomanipulator is then inserted in the
molecule collector so that the cold substrate is in front
of the electron gun. The surface is set at a bias voltage
of +45 V to prevent secondary electrons from escaping
the surface. The current read on the substrate when ir-
radiating is therefore the incident electron current. The
bias voltage had no inﬂuence on the ESD yields other
than that due to the change of incident electron kinetic
energy, which is taken into account.

The ice is irradiated at a given electron energy for
about 20-30 seconds, usually with a beam current of
around 100 nA (ﬂux of electron ∼ 6 × 1011 e−.s−1), and
the desorption signal of the relevant species is recorded
on the QMS as an increase of partial pressure. Si-
multaneously, the substrate (incident beam) current is
recorded with a Keithley picoammeter. The procedure
is repeated on the same ice spot (since the molecular
collector does not allow to move the sample) for a series
of electron energies. We checked that the order in which
points were measured did not inﬂuence the desorption
yields measured.

Once the data is recorded, the average value of the
QMS current iQM S during irradiation for each energy is
divided by the beam current Φe− , then converted to an
absolute ESD yield Y:

Figure 2. Calibration of the deposition of 15N2 ice using
TPD. A given amount of molecules, measured as a pressure
drop in a known closed volume indicated in the legend, is de-
posited on the substrate, which is subsequently heated with
a linear temperature ramp of 10 K/min, and the QMS signal
is monitored as a function of temperature. The progressive
appearance of a sharp peak at low temperature marks the
onset of the multilayer regime.

due to ESD when irradiating the sample is increased.
Based on measurements made inside and outside the
collector for N2 ESD, it is estimated that the collector
brings an improvement of a factor of ∼ 8 to the signal-
to-noise ratio of the QMS signal.

The calibration of QMS current to ESD yield to derive
the calibration factor kX for species X is made using the
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) technique.
This calibration technique is described e.g.
in ref. 15.
It consists in assuming that the calibration factor kX
between QMS current and desorption ﬂux is also valid
in a thermal desorption experiment such as TPD. Since
the ice thickness deposition is calibrated (using TPD)
we can deposit a known absolute number of molecules
on the substrate and evaporate it in a TPD experiment.
Then we have:

X

where N1M L

is the total number of molecules for 1
monolayer (ML = ∼ 1015 mol.cm−2 × 2 cm2 for all
the gases considered here) and iT P D is the signal read
on the QMS during the TPD experiment where exactly
1 ML is sublimated. For example, for N2 we derived
a value of kN2 = 1.05 × 10−23 A.s. For species for
which a TPD experiment is not possible (e.g. H2), the
calibration factor can be extrapolated from the one of
another molecule by taking into account the relative sen-
sitivity of the QMS to the two diﬀerent species. This
relative sensitivity is measured by injecting known pres-
sures (using a calibrated gauge) of the respective gases
in the chamber and measuring the corresponding QMS
signals.

The root-mean-squared noise of the QMS measure-
ment is taken as a measurement uncertainty for the error
bars in the subsequent ﬁgures. We thus consider that
there is no uncertainty on the beam current measure-
ment. This assumption can be wrong, in particular if
there is reﬂection of electrons on the gold substrate and
subsequent escape from the ice, which would lead to an
underestimation of the true incident current. This point
is also discussed later in the text. As for the absolute
yield calibration, we estimate a ∼ 50 % uncertainty.

III. RESULTS

Electron-stimulated desorption was

studied and
quantiﬁed between 150 and 2000 eV for ﬁve molecu-
lar ice systems: N2, CO, Ar, CO2 and H2O (or D2O).
The results for each of these systems will ﬁrst be pre-
sented separately. Further interpretation of these re-
sults, in particular of the electron energy dependence,
in the frame of the notion of desorption-relevant depth,
will be made in the Discussion part.

(monolayer) and 200 ML ices and for deposition tempera-

Lower panel: curves for 20, 50 and 100 ML ices deposited at
14 K. The secondary electron yield (SEY) of 30 ML N2 ice
from ref. 24 is also shown.

A. N2

Experiments were performed on both regular N2 and
isotopically labeled 15N2. No diﬀerences were observed,
and only the results for 15N2 will be presented here,
except for one curve measured on 14N2 to substanti-
ate the absence of diﬀerence between the isotopes. The
only desorbing species observed was N2 itself, although
it is possible that very small amounts of N, N3 or N4
desorb as well25. Nitrogen ice exhibits green lumines-
cence when irradiated with electrons, which allows to
cross-check the shape and position of the electron spot
directly on the sample.

On the upper panel of ﬁg. 3, results for four diﬀerent
ices are shown, for 200 and 500 ML (monolayer) thick-
nesses and for a deposition temperature of the ice of 14
and 21 K. All the curves are very similar. Therefore the
deposition temperature of the ice does not have an ef-
fect here, and the ESD yields already correspond to the
semi-inﬁnite ice values at 200 ML. We also checked (not
shown) that the temperature at which the ice is main-
tained during the irradiation does not have an eﬀect
either (from 14 to 22 K: above 22 K thermal desorption
becomes higher than ESD). The only identiﬁed struc-
tural change for N2 ice occurs around 35 K26, a tem-
perature outside the range that can be accessed under
high vacuum conditions. There are no other indications

atures explored here (for example the density remains
constant27), therefore these results are not surprising.
The curves exhibit a maximum around 300 eV.

Results for thinner ices are shown on the bottom
panel of ﬁg. 3. When we reach down to 20 ML, the
curve ”ﬂattens” with a higher yield at high electron en-
ergies (> 500 eV) and a slightly lower yield around the
maximum (< 500 eV). To explain why the curve ﬂat-
tens for thinner ﬁlms, we need to take into account the
substrate. Indeed, electrons with a penetration depth
higher than the ﬁlm thickness will reach the substrate.
Excitations of the substrate could then take place and
inﬂuence the yield, but another factor is the reﬂection of
electrons on the substrate. In particular, gold has a high
specular reﬂection coeﬃcient for electrons, e.g about 0.4
at 2 keV28. Two distinct consequences of electron re-
ﬂection can lead to the observed increase (or apparent
increase) of the desorption yield at high electron energy,
if the penetration depth of the electrons is at least twice
the thickness of the ﬁlm (i.e. electrons can be reﬂected
and reach the surface again). The ﬁrst is that electrons
will then re-deposit energy close to the surface, leading
to a higher yield than in the semi-inﬁnite ice case. The
second is that if reﬂected electrons escape the surface,
this will lead to an underestimation of the true incident
current, and thus to an apparent increase of the ESD
yields.

On the ﬁgure is also shown a measurement of the sec-
ondary electron yield (SEY) of N2, taken from Kuzucan
et al.24. The SEY curve, which was measured for a 30
ML ice at 4.7 K, closely resembles the ESD curves of
about the same thickness (20 ML), suggesting similar
processes drive ESD and SEY in this case.

The absolute ESD yield for N2 reaches about 3.3
molecules/electron at the maximum. The yield at 1 keV
is 1.6 molecules/electron, which compares very well with
the value of 1.8 molecules/electron found in ref.17 and
In ref.10 the
quantiﬁed using a quartz microbalance.
value indicated is about 2.5 molecules/electron, which
is also close. There are other studies of ESD from
25,29–31 which however did not report quantitative es-
N2
timates, focusing instead on other phenomena such as
desorption of excited species, kinetic energy distribution
measurements or luminescence.

B. CO

The ESD yield for CO ices of diﬀerent thicknesses
and deposition temperatures are shown in ﬁg. 4 (up-
per panel for CO desorption). Once again, a typical
curve with a maximum at 300 eV is observed. The
yield, however, is much higher than for N2. The yields
have already reached a semi-inﬁnite ice value at 100 ML.
Measurements of CO ESD for thinner ﬁlms were made
diﬃcult by the high ESD yield of the molecule and the
modiﬁcation of the ﬁlm during irradiation: too much
of the ice was processed or removed during the mea-

ent thicknesses and deposition temperatures. The SEY of 15

temperatures.

surement (for an ESD yield of 10 mol/electron and an
irradiation at 100 nA on a 0.1 cm2 spot the removal
rate is about 3 ML/minute). No eﬀect of the deposi-
tion temperature (14-21 K) is observed. Also shown on
ﬁg.4a for comparison is the CO SEY from Kuzucan et
al.24, which here diﬀers slightly from the ESD curves,
both at low and high energies. This SEY curve was
measured at a thickness of 15 ML, which explains the
discrepancy at high electron energies (> 500 eV), as
specular reﬂection of electrons and substrate contribu-
tion will play a role here as well. At low electron en-
ergies, the maximum of the SEY occurs at 200 eV and
is therefore diﬀerent from the 300 eV maximum of the
ESD, which will be explained later. Our value of ∼3.8
CO molecules/electron at 1 keV is close to the value
of Tratnik et al.10 (∼4.5 molecules/el) but higher than
the values reported by Schou et al. and Brown et al.13
which are below 1 molecule/electron.

Contrary to N2 ice, a lot of chemistry can already hap-
pen during the irradiation of CO ice, as many carbon
chain species can be formed. Refs21,32 are examples of
studies of the irradiation-induced chemistry in CO ice,
which includes formation of many Cn, CnO and CnO2
species. Although we cannot probe the chemistry hap-
pening in the ice here, we can observe one of the main
products desorbing in the gas phase, CO2. No other
species are observed desorbing. The ESD yield of CO2
from a CO ice is shown in the lower panel of ﬁg. 4. We
observed a progressive increase of CO2 desorption over

D. CO2

Solid carbon dioxide has a complex range of possi-
ble structures. CO2 ﬁlms can be crystalline or amor-
phous to various degrees depending on the conditions
of preparation of the ice. The ice is amorphous when
deposited at a temperature of 14 K (the base temper-
ature of our set-up) and becomes gradually more and
more crystalline for deposition temperatures up to 75 K
or when it is annealed to such temperatures (above this
temperature, under our experimental conditions, the ice
starts to signiﬁcantly sublimate)34. Deposition temper-
ature also signiﬁcantly aﬀects the density and porosity,
with an ice 40% less dense when deposited at 14 K than
when deposited at 75 K35.

Experiments were done on both regular CO2 and iso-
topically labeled 13CO2. As for N2 only the experiments
with 13CO2 will be presented here - except for one curve
on 12CO2 - as no diﬀerences were observed between the
isotopes. Three diﬀerent phases of the ice are investi-
gated: one where the ice is grown at 14 K and irradiated
as is (Amorph.), one where the ice is grown at 14 K then
annealed for 5 minutes to 75 K (Ann.), and one where
the ice is directly deposited at 75 K (Crys.). The latter
two show crystalline properties but are diﬀerent, which
is seen from the fact that CO2 ice directly deposited at
75 K can be seen with the naked eye on the surface.
A 200 ML ice is usually too thin to be visible. Here
a very clear and colored square with iridescence is ob-
served. Presumably the ice grown at 75 K is the most
crystalline one and the crystalline order is at the origin
of this optical property. In the absence of more struc-
tural insights, we do not presume any of the properties
of the annealed and crystalline ices, such as their de-

thicknesses are shown on the upper panel and low thicknesses

the course of a few minutes after the beginning of ir-
radiation, due probably to the accumulation of CO2 in
the ice. Desorption reaches a constant value after some
time and the yields shown correspond to that steady
state value. The yield is very small (two orders of mag-
nitude smaller than CO) and therefore the error bars
are large, so it is diﬃcult to conﬁrm whether there is a
diﬀerence in the shape of the ESD curves between CO
and CO2.

C. Ar

The ESD yield of solid argon as a function of electron
energy and ice thickness is displayed in ﬁg. 5, with the
high thicknesses on the upper panel and the low thick-
nesses on the lower panel. The shape of the ESD yield
curve changes depending on the thickness up to about
300 ML, with the maximum shifting to higher energies.
Above 300 ML the shape and intensity become stable,
with only marginal changes for the highest electron en-
ergies. The shape of the desorption curve of Ar ice at
high thickness is markedly diﬀerent from what is ob-
served for the two previous ices.

Quantitatively, the yield of 4.5 Ar atoms/electron at

noted that in the case of the crystalline and annealed
CO2 ice, which are respectively grown at 75 K or an-
nealed for some time at that temperature, the actual
ice thickness is lower than the nominal thickness since
the temperature is above the sublimation temperature
of the ice. In the ﬁgures to follow, the ices are labeled
Amorph., Ann. or Crys. according to the method of
growth. All ices were irradiated at 14 K.

The results for desorption of CO2 are displayed in
ﬁg. 6. The yields and shape of the curves for the three
phases are very close. The curves are again compared
with the SEY results of Kuzucan et al.24, which have
the same maximum at 300 eV. The SEY curve is ﬂatter
(higher at high electron energies relative to the maxi-
mum) but this is again ascribed to thickness diﬀerences,
as the SEY was measured for a 20 ML ice.

The most abundant desorbing species is not the par-
ent molecule CO2 but a product of dissociation, CO.
Also observed desorbing is O2, although the yield is
lower. This is consistent with other studies of desorp-
tion from CO2, whether the ones with ions16 or the ones
with VUV photons36,37. The desorption yields of CO
and O2 for the same ices that were presented in the
previous ﬁgure are shown in ﬁg. 7. Similarly to the
CO case, there is a time dependence for the desorption
of these products with a gradual increase over a few

discuss the plateau value here. Although the absolute
yields do not diﬀer signiﬁcantly for diﬀerent structures
of the ice (which is consistent with the result of Sie et al.
for VUV photons37), there is a diﬀerence in the shape of
the curves. As we go from the more crystalline ice (de-
posited at 75 K) to the more porous and amorphous one
(deposited at 14 K), there is a shift towards higher en-
ergies of the maximum (CO: 300 eV for Crys., between
300 and 400 eV for Ann, 400 eV for Amorph.; O2: 300
eV for Crys., 400 eV for Ann., 500 eV for Amorph.).

E. H2O/D2O

The ESD yield curve of H2O from water ice is shown
in ﬁg. 8a for diﬀerent phases and temperatures of the
ice. The ice is grown at 15 K to obtain porous amor-
phous solid water (p-ASW), at 100 K to obtain compact
amorphous solid water (c-ASW) and 140 K for crys-
talline water. The irradiation temperature can then also
be varied. It is clear from ﬁg. 8a that the phase does not
have signiﬁcant eﬀects on the desorption of H2O. The
yields for higher irradiation temperatures are systemat-
ically higher, but not by much. The SEY of water ice
adapted from ref. 38 is also shown on ﬁg. 8a. While the
maxima look similar between the SEY and ESD curves,
the shape are not exactly the same but it is diﬃcult to
comment further, especially considering the error bars

We have also made experiments on D2O ice, and the
results displayed in ﬁg. 8b that show the ESD yield of
D2O from compact amorphous D2O ice at 15 or 100 K
show an isotope eﬀect in the absolute yields. We ﬁnd a
factor of ∼ 5 between the desorption yields of H2O and
D2O. A similar factor was found for VUV desorption of
water39, although the explanation for this observation
is not clear at the moment.

On ﬁg. 9, the results obtained at 15 K for the desorp-
tion of H2/D2 and O2 from H2O/D2O ices are shown.
The desorption of H2 and O2 show time dependences
as well, and again points were taken when the signal
had reached a relatively stable value. The yield of H2O,
measured simultaneously, did not show any time depen-
dence. Results for the desorption of H2 and O2 at higher
temperatures are not shown because of quantiﬁcation
and time dependence issues.

Considerable amount of work has been made on water
ice ESD, to which the reader is referred for more details.
To cite only those that consider neutral species des-
orption and without being exhaustive, there have been
studies of ESD by low-energy (< 20 eV) electrons40,41,
and numerous studies of ESD by sub-keV electrons in
the group of Petrik and Kimmel42–44 and more recently
in the group of McCoustra45,46, that point to the com-
plexity of the energy transport and chemistry leading to
production of H2 and O2, in particular.

Quantitative studies of water ESD43,46 agree with our
results at least in the order of magnitude, although these
works look at the H2O loss from the bulk and therefore
constitute only an upper limit on the water yield. The
total estimated loss of 0.5 molecules/electron in ref. 43
for 87 eV electrons incident on D2O at low temperature
is much higher than our D2O yield at low electron en-
ergies, around 0.02 molecules/electron. The diﬀerence
could be explained by loss of D2O through desorption
of products of chemistry. No absolute sputtering yields
are reported for H2O in this study. The number of 0.1-
0.5 molecules/electron for 200-300 eV electrons on H2O
in ref. 46 is close to our derived yield.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Desorption-relevant depth

In the electronic stopping regime - which concerns
electrons and fast ions - particles interact with the elec-
trons of a material and deposit energy mainly in the
form of electronic excitations. This interaction is char-
acterized by the stopping power, which is the amount of
energy deposited by the particle in the material per unit
distance traveled. Desorption induced by particles in
the electronic regime is therefore assumed to be related
to the stopping power of the particle-target pair. The
underlying assumption here is that the desorption yield
depends in some way on the amount of energy deposited
at or ”near” the surface, since desorption is a surface

8

eﬀect, and this amount of energy is by deﬁnition pro-
portional to the stopping power. Indeed, the observed
desorption yields as a function of particle energy - and
therefore of stopping power - usually verify a power law,
the dependence often being linear or quadratic16,47. A
linear relation can be interpreted in terms of domination
of a mechanism of desorption involving independent in-
dividual events (event = excitation or ionization of a
molecule), although such mechanisms do not necessar-
ily lead to a strictly linear relation depending on the
details of energy relaxation in the system considered. A
superlinear (often but not necessarily quadratic) rela-
tion instead suggests mechanisms of desorption involv-
ing the cooperation of multiple events. Transitions from
one behaviour to another are possible over the range of
stopping powers, and in some cases it is even possible
to observe diﬀerent regimes for similar stopping pow-
ers but diﬀerent particle velocities48. The occurence of
such complex transitions and other factors like absolute
yields depend on the details of energy deposition and
relaxation in the considered system.

Water ice has been explored on the broadest range
of stopping power, and consistently exhibits a desorp-
tion yield proportional to the square of the stopping
power20. This is also the case for CO ice49,50, and for
CO2 ice51–54. The stopping power dependence of Ar ice
is almost linear55. For N2 ice, a transition is observed
from a quadratic dependence at high stopping power
to a linear dependence at low stopping power56. This
particular transition has been related to a progressive
increase of deposited energy density leading to an over-
lap of initially separated cascades triggered by single
events.

These stopping power dependences, which have most
often been measured for ion sputtering, remain true in
the keV electron regime (which corresponds to a low
stopping power regime relative to most of the studies
made with ions). In the sub-keV regime, on the other
hand, we start encountering discrepancies between stop-
ping power and ESD yields. Existing measurements of
stopping power at low electron energies57,58 show that
stopping power keeps increasing when going towards
lower electron energies, down to around 100 eV - simi-
larly to electron-impact ionization cross-sections, for ex-
ample, which are also related to the degree of electron-
matter interaction. We saw in the various examples
presented here that ESD curves on the other hand tend
to have a maximum around 200-300 eV or even higher.
For example, in ﬁg. 10, the ESD yield of N2 for a 500
ML ice grown and irradiated at 14 K, previously shown
in ﬁg. 3 is compared to the measured stopping power of
ref.57 for electrons going through N2 ice. We see a good
agreement at high energies, in particular with the mea-
sured stopping power, but deviations at low energies.
Another example is shown in ﬁg. 11 where the ESD
curves of H2O desorption from H2O ices are compared
with the square of the stopping power for the ice. The
deviation at low energies is again clear.

Deviations at low energy originate from the fact that

the desorption yield is no longer proportional to the
stopping power, because energy deposition occurs en-
tirely near the surface. When the electron penetration
depth becomes low enough, one needs ﬁrst to take into
account the details of the energy deposition structure,
which is not exactly uniform. According to the Monte-
Carlo simulations of ref.60, the energy deposition proﬁle
as a function of depth is better approximated by a trun-
cated Gaussian. Examples at diﬀerent electron energies

were computed using the parameters given in ref. 60 for
N2 ice and are plotted in ﬁg. 12b. But in addition to the
exact energy deposition structure, one also needs to take
into account energy (or particle) transport phenomena.
While desorption is really a surface process in the
sense that the desorbing molecules are from the top
molecular layer, a deeper part of the uppermost lay-
ers can be involved in desorption (see the example of
the detailed study of ref. 61 for photon-stimulated des-
orption). Energy (for example in the form of excitons
or electrons) or particles (energetic fragments, diﬀus-
ing light species) can be transported from below up

to the surface and may cause desorption, depending
on the desorption mechanism involved. Such transport
can be characterized by a length scale, which we call
the desorption-relevant depth λdes. This desorption-
relevant depth corresponds to the transport length scale
of the mechanism(s) which dominate energy and/or par-
ticle transport, and its exact deﬁnition will depend on
these mechanisms.

For incident fast charged particles that have a pen-
etration depth (Λe) in the ice much greater than the
desorption-relevant depth, the desorption yield is re-
lated (linearly or by a higher order relation depending
on the dominant type of desorption mechanism) to the
stopping power, as particles all deposit uniformly within
the whole desorption-relevant depth region an amount
of energy proportional to that stopping power. How-
ever, when the penetration depth becomes comparable
to the desorption-relevant depth, this will no longer be
the case. The other extreme would be the case of inci-
dent electrons depositing all of their energy very close
to the surface. We would then expect the desorption
yield to be proportional to the energy of the electron,
rather than its energy loss per unit distance. These two
diﬀerent regimes are schematized in ﬁg. 12a.

The

amount

of deposited energy within the
desorption-relevant depth region will reach a maximum
for the intermediate of these two regimes. In ﬁg. 12b,
the computed energy deposition proﬁles were integrated
up to given values of λdes, and the result as a function
of electron energy is plotted in the inset. One can see
how the maximum occurs at diﬀerent electron energies
depending on λdes. These curves are simpliﬁed models
that do not reproduce actual ESD curves, as one also
needs to take into account how the energy (or parti-
cle) transport is attenuated. For example, if we had

energy ESD curve.

a transport mechanism with a diﬀusion-like behaviour,
the amount of energy that could migrate from a given
layer to the surface would exponentially decrease with
the distance to the surface. The desorption-relevant
depth would then be the characteristic length scale of
this exponential.

B. Application to argon ice

Argon ice provides useful demonstrations of the appli-
cation of the notion of desorption-relevant depth. First,
the above-mentioned low-energy linear regime is visible

the two diﬀerent regimes of energy deposition occurs at
much higher electron energy than for the other ices. The
ESD yield of a 500 ML Ar ice grown and irradiated at
14 K is presented on ﬁg. 13, along with the stopping
power from ref. 57. Up until 500 eV the desorption
yield is linear with electron energy (the lowest point at
150 eV is oﬀ because of charging issues). The regime in
which the yield is proportional to stopping power is not
visible in our electron energy range limited to 2 keV.

A consequence of the existence of these two regimes
is that the ESD yield curve in the transition regime
is characteristic of the desorption-relevant depth of the
considered system. Around the maximum of the curve,
where the ESD yield starts to deviate from the stopping
power, we have λdes ∼ Λe and it is therefore possible to
estimate the value of λdes, knowing the electron penetra-
tion depths. Hence for N2 ice with a maximum around
250 eV we have λdes ∼ 10 ML (30 ˚A). In ﬁg. 10 and ﬁg.
13 the upper axis shows the experimental estimates of
the electron penetration depth as a function of electron
energy from Adams et al.57.

This principle is also well illustrated in the thickness
dependence of Ar ice ESD, already presented in ﬁg. 5.
So far an underlying assumption in our model was that
the ices were considered semi-inﬁnite. For ices of ﬁ-
nite thickness, it is possible to have an ice thinner than
the ”intrinsic” desorption-relevant depth, in which case
the whole ice is involved in desorption and the eﬀec-
tive desorption-relevant depth becomes the ice thick-
ness itself. This is what we observed for argon ﬁlms
in ﬁg. 5. The shape of the ESD yield curve changes
with thickness: the maximum shifts progressively to-
wards higher energies as the thickness increases, un-
til the thickness of the ice becomes much higher than
the intrinsic desorption-relevant depth, around 300 ML.
From the ESD yield curve of the semi-inﬁnite thickness
ice, we can estimate that the desorption-relevant depth
in our Argon ices is approximately 100 ML. This is in
line with the saturation of the yields reached around
300 ML: for an exponentially attenuated energy migra-
tion process we would expect the yields to completely
saturate above approximately 3 times the characteristic
migration length scale.

This large intrinsic desorption-relevant depth is linked
with the mechanisms of excitation transport in the ice,
as mentioned previously. Desorption mechanisms and
excitation transport in the case of rare-gas solids like ar-
gon have been extensively studied and are therefore well
known. Rare gas solids host excitons that can migrate
over large distances in the ice, with typical estimates in
the 70 - 500 ML range depending on the studies33,55,62,
which is consistent with what we observe. Previous
studies on the thickness dependence of electron or ion-
stimulated desorption of argon found results very simi-
lar to ours33,55. Migration of electronic excitations (ex-
citons) is therefore what drives the desorption-relevant
depth in the case of argon ice.

The variation of the observed exciton migration dis-

500 ML Ar:CO ices with 2% and 5% CO are compared with
ESD yields from 500 ML and 75 ML pure Ar ices. In the

and 5% N2 are compared with the ESD yield from 500 ML

tances in argon ice stems from its sensitivity to the pres-
ence of impurities and defects in the ice. To illustrate
the inﬂuence of this on the desorption-relevant depth,
and consequently on the ESD yields, we performed ex-
periments where impurities of CO or N2 were deliber-
ately added to argon ice. The results are presented in
ﬁg. 14. The Ar desorption yield for 500 ML ices of
diﬀerent compositions are presented. The upper panel
corresponds to Ar:CO mixes with 2% and 5% CO, while
the lower panel corresponds to Ar:N2 mixes with similar
amounts of N2. The results are compared with the pure
Ar case.

The addition of impurities signiﬁcantly aﬀects the
ESD yield curves. In the case of CO, both curves are
very diﬀerent from the pure Ar 500 ML curve and closely
resemble the 75 ML curve instead. This indicates that
the CO impurities, acting as exciton sinks, eﬀectively
reduce the exciton migration distance, and therefore
the desorption-relevant depth. The case of N2 impu-
rities (lower panel) is slightly diﬀerent: while the curves
display a diﬀerent maximum, respectively around 1250,
1000 and 750 eV for the pure, 2% and 5% ices, the yields
are higher than for the Ar:CO ice case or the pure 75
ML Ar ice case. We interpret this in the following way:

maximum, characterizes the desorption-relevant depth,
which is again reduced by the addition of impurities.
However, N2 addition may also have an additional ef-
fect on the absolute Ar desorption yields, for example
surface N2 molecules may eﬃciently trap migrating exci-
tons, and then transfer energy to neighboring Ar atoms,
leading to desorption. The diﬀerence between N2 and
CO may reside in the electronic structure of the two
molecules: the ﬁrst dipole-allowed electronic state of
solid CO is lower in energy (around 8 eV63) than the
ﬁrst solid Ar exciton (around 11.5 eV64) while in the
case of solid N2 the ﬁrst dipole-allowed state lies around
12 eV65, above the ﬁrst exciton threshold. Thus energy
transfer from CO to Ar should be hindered, preventing a
boosting eﬀect similar to the one observed for N2. Com-
plementary experiments using other types of impurities
would be necessary to conﬁrm these hypotheses.

C. Structure- and desorbate-dependent
desorption-relevant depths in CO2

Let us now turn to the case of CO2 ice. We recall that
an interesting eﬀect is observed in the desorption of CO
and O2, with a variation of their desorption maxima de-
pending on the ice structure (ﬁg. 7). This eﬀect can also
be seen from a diﬀerent angle by plotting instead the
curves of the three desorbing products (normalized at
400 eV for comparison) for either the crystalline (grown
at 75 K) ice, the annealed (grown at 14 K and annealed
to 75 K) or the porous amorphous (grown at 14 K) ice,
as in ﬁg. 15. In this ﬁgure we see that for the crystalline
ice (upper panel), the maximum of the curve occurs ba-
sically at the same energy (300 eV) for all three species,
despite some diﬀerences between the relative intensities.
On the other hand, for the porous amorphous 14 K ice
(lower panel), we see that the maximum is similar to
the crystalline ice for CO2 but shifts towards higher en-
ergies for CO and even more for O2. The annealed ice
(middle panel) is intermediary between amorphous and
crystalline.

Considering the interpretation of the ESD yield
curves developed above, where the maximum character-
izes the desorption-relevant depth, this means that for
the porous amorphous ice, deeper layers are involved in
the desorption of O2 than for CO, and for CO than for
CO2 - but this is not the case for the crystalline ice. This
is well explained by considering the desorption mecha-
nisms of these diﬀerent species, especially the weight of
chemistry (in the sense of exothermic (re)formation of
these species from CO2 dissociation products, and des-
orption due to the excess energy). Desorption of CO2
can involve chemistry but also more direct processes.
it can desorb directly by
Desorption of CO is similar:
dissociation of CO2 but also form and desorb from chem-
ical processes. As for O2, the direct dissociation of CO2
is not likely to yield it and therefore chemistry has to
be involved in its formation and subsequent desorption.

12

Figure 15. Comparison between the yields of CO, O2 and
CO2 for the crystalline (top panel), the annealed (middle
panel) and the porous amorphous (bottom panel) CO2 ices.
The yields have been normalized at 400 eV for comparison.
The approximate maximum of each curve is indicated by
dashed vertical lines.

When the ice is porous and amorphous, radicals formed
by dissociation of bulk CO2 can reach the surface, react
and enhance chemistry, which will aﬀect the most, in
order, O2, then CO, then CO2, considering the weight
that chemistry should play in the formation and des-
orption of these three species. Note that diﬀusion is not
necessarily thermal - the thermal diﬀusion of radicals
in CO2 ice is unknown but may be low at 14 K - but
also non-thermal, due to the kinetic energy imparted to
fragments upon dissociation. It is also possible that O2
and CO formed in the bulk directly migrate to the sur-
face, where they are subsequently desorbed by another
excitation. These migration phenomena do not occur
for crystalline CO2 where bulk species cannot reach the
surface (at least not at 14 K).

The desorption of e.g. O2 from CO2 ice is therefore an
example of a case where the desorption-relevant depth
is dominated not by energy transport (in the form of
secondary electron or electronic excitation migration,
for example) but particle transport: migration of species
from the bulk to the surface. It also provides a good
illustration of the use that ESD yield curves can have
as a probe, revealing the eﬃciency of migration to the

D. Dominant contributions to the desorption-relevant
depth of diﬀerent molecular ices

We ﬁnish by discussing the approximate desorption-
relevant depth and the dominant type of transport set-
ting this depth for the diﬀerent molecular ices studied
here. The desorption-relevant depth are estimated from
the maximum of the ESD yield curves and the corre-
sponding electron penetration depth. These only consti-
tute rough estimations. The desorption-relevant depths
are expressed here in MLs, and the approximate conver-
sion from ML to ˚A is 1 ML ∼ 3 ˚A (the actual number
depends on the ice density).

We addressed above the question of the desorption-
relevant depth of argon ice, which is speciﬁc and diﬀer-
ent from the molecular ices as it hosts excitons. The
desorption-relevant depth is λdes ∼ 100 ML and is af-
fected by the presence of impurities, as demonstrated in
the experiments presented in ﬁg. 14. In the case of N2
ice, we pointed out previously the similarity between
the ESD curve and the SEY curve (ﬁg. 3). The de-
rived characteristic desorption-relevant depth is around
10-15 ML (∼ 30 ˚A), which is also the typical approxi-
mate escape depth of secondary electrons24,66. Both of
these facts point to the dominant energy carrier being
secondary electrons in N2 ice. The transport of sec-
ondary electrons is the default dominant contribution
to the desorption-relevant depth in ESD, in the absence
of other transport mechanisms with longer length scales,
since it is always present. This also implies that trans-
port mechanisms with length scales lower than ∼ 10
ML (such as the indirect desorption process identiﬁed
in VUV PSD from CO ice61) cannot be probed using
this method.

For CO ice, there is a diﬀerence between SEY and
ESD curves (ﬁg. 4). Aside from the diﬀerence at high
energy due to specular reﬂection of electrons, this diﬀer-
ence can be explained by the square of stopping power
dependence of ESD for this system. It is therefore not
clear whether secondary electron transport is the only
dominant mechanism here, although the desorption-
relevant depth is similarly to N2 around 10-15 ML.
Chemistry leading to reformation and exothermic des-
orption of CO could contribute, and the quadratic stop-
ping power dependence lends credit to this hypothesis,
as desorption from exothermic chemistry involves mul-
tiple consecutive excitation events. There is no partic-
ular evidence for electronic energy transfer in CO ice.
For CO2 ice (λdes ∼ 10 - 20 ML), we have shown that
the desorption-relevant depth depends on the consid-
ered desorbing species and the structure of the ice. We
explained such a diﬀerence by the diﬀusion of species
from the bulk to the surface. As the desorption-relevant
depth found is close to the escape depth of secondary
electrons, they certainly also contribute in a signiﬁcant
way to transport in CO2 ice.

13

For H2O ice, experimental diﬃculties (high error bars,
transitory behaviour of product desorption) obscure the
conclusions that can be drawn. The ESD yield curves
seem to have similar shapes within the experimental er-
rors. We may have expected observations similar to CO2
ice with maxima shifts due to diﬀusion in the porous
structure. Instead the desorption of these species may
be dominated by surface reactions, as emphasized in
PSD studies39. For the diﬀerent structures and desorb-
ing species from H2O ice, λdes should not exceed 10-20
ML either considering the curve shapes. Mechanisms
contributing to the desorption-relevant depth in H2O
ice could include, aside from secondary electrons, the
diﬀusion of species and the presence of excitons that
seem to have a migration length scale of the order of 20
ML43,45.

V. CONCLUSION

We quantiﬁed the electron-stimulated desorption of
neutral species for various molecular ice systems (N2,
CO, CO2, H2O/D2O) and solid Ar, in the 150 - 2000
eV electron energy range. Our results are in good agree-
ment with the pre-existing quantiﬁed measurements of
ESD on some of these systems, and expand to the des-
orption of species other than the parent molecule and
the exploration of ice temperature and structure ef-
fects. These results are summarized in table I, which
lists for the studied systems the desorbing species, the
electron energy where the desorption yield is maximum,
the corresponding maximum yield, as well as the above-
discussed values of the desorption-relevant depths and
corresponding dominant sources of transport in the ice.
This new data as well as the physical considerations
developed in this article and summarized below should
help a better modelling of ESD-related phenomena in
the above-mentioned ﬁelds of e.g. vacuum dynamics in
accelerators or astrochemistry.

We showed that interpretation of the electron energy
dependence of ESD in the sub-keV regime requires going
beyond simple stopping power considerations. We intro-
duce the notion of desorption-relevant depth, a quantity
characterizing how transport of energy or particle from
the bulk to the surface make layers below the surface
contribute to desorption. This is illustrated in the spe-
ciﬁc case of Argon, where excitons allow for a particu-
larly long transport range observed in the ice thickness
dependence of the yield curve. For molecular ices, it also
allows to evidence a diﬀerence of species migration to
the surface in porous amorphous vs. crystalline phases,
illustrated in the CO2 ice case. In addition to bringing
further fundamental understanding of the electron en-
ergy dependence of ESD, this study therefore also high-
lights the possible use of ESD as a probe of various
phenomena (e.g. migration of electronic excitations or
radicals and molecules) in systems like molecular ices.
