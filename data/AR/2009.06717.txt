ABSTRACT

Recent observations demonstrated that emerging ﬂux regions, which constitute the
early stage of solar active regions, consist of emergence of numerous small-scale mag-
netic elements. They in turn interact, merge, and form mature sunspots. However,
observations of ﬁne magnetic structures on photosphere with sub-arcsecond resolution
are very rare due to limitations of observing facilities. In this work, taking advantage
of the high resolution of the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope, we jointly analyze vector
magnetic ﬁelds, continuum images, and Hα observations of NOAA AR 12665 on 2017
July 13, with the goal of understanding the signatures of small-scale ﬂux emergence,
as well as their atmospheric responses as they emerge through multiple heights in
photosphere and chromosphere. Under such a high resolution of 0.′′1 to 0.′′2, our re-
sults conﬁrm two kinds of small-scale ﬂux emergence: magnetic ﬂux sheet emergence
associated with the newly forming granules, and the traditional magnetic ﬂux loop
emergence. With direct imaging in the broadband TiO, we observe that both types of
ﬂux emergence are associated with darkening of granular boundaries, while only ﬂux
sheets elongate granules along the direction of emerging magnetic ﬁelds and expand
laterally. With a life span of 10∼15 minutes, the total emerged vertical ﬂux is in
order of 1018 Mx for both types of emergence. The magnitudes of the vertical and
horizontal ﬁelds are comparable in the ﬂux sheets, while the former is stronger in
ﬂux loops. Hα observations reveal transient brightenings in the wings in the events of
magnetic loop emergence, which are most probably the signatures of Ellerman bombs.

1. INTRODUCTION

Flux emergence, through which magnetic ﬁelds are transported to the solar atmo-
sphere from sub-surface, is considered to be generated by convective motions and
aided by magnetic buoyancy in solar interior (Schmidt 1968, 1974). Flux emergence
in diﬀerent scales is important for energy release in diﬀerent forms, inlcuding small-

scale brightenings and large-scale solar eruptions. The typical scenario of emergence
is that magnetic ﬁelds are twisted underneath the photosphere due to ﬂows and rise
to form an Ω-loop due to magnetic buoyancy (Parker 1977; Fan 2001). Observations
of emissions in the solar atmosphere such as in UV/EUV provide evidence that energy
may be released due to reconnection during the process of emergence. The magnetic
ﬁelds emerging through convection zone are not constrained to rise in an aligned ori-
entation with the pre-existing ﬁeld, so the magnetic reconnection is expected to occur
between the emerging ﬂuxes and pre-existing ﬂuxes. Overall, on the large scale in
the solar photosphere, the orientation of emerging ﬁelds is roughly aligned with the
direction connecting paired polarity spots (Otsuji et al. 2011; Centeno 2012).

Taking advantage of high-resolution (∼0.′′3) observations, De Pontieu (2002) found
that magnetic concentrations emerge within the granule interior and quickly (∼10–
15 minutes) disperse following granule ﬂows. The author speculates such ﬂux emer-
gence initiates with horizontal magnetic structures. The study of Cheung et al. (2007)
supported these ﬁndings from the simulation perspective. They found that emerging
magnetic elements with suﬃciently high ﬁeld strength can also impact on the gran-
ular structure. The elongated granule and intergranular lane darkening are reported
on the photosphere with observations in visible wavelengths (Zwaan 1985; Lim et al.
2011; Yang et al. 2016). On the other hand, the recent study of Campos Rozo et al.
(2019) showed that while small magnetic elements are advected to upper layers on the
surface through normal convection, emergent magnetic ﬁelds with B>50 G tend to
in turn induce the photospheric motions by governing the plasma ﬂows. The authors
also found that such emergent-ﬂux-related ﬂow ﬁelds change velocity distributions as
well as granule elongation.

Besides the dynamic magnetic characteristics observed on the photosphere, varia-
tions of brightness from continuum images provide clear indications of magnetic ﬂux
emergence. Yurchyshyn et al. (2012) found that small-scale ﬂux emergences have as-
sociated bright points on the photosphere, mostly inside solar granulation, in which
the ﬁeld emerges at a size scale less than 1–2 Mm (e.g Lites et al. 1996; De Pontieu
2002). They suggested that the emergence of relatively strong ﬁelds create bright
points at the footpoints of magnetic loops, which intrude into intergranular lanes.
Ellerman bombs (EBs) (Ellerman 1917), the bright signatures essentially observed in
Hα wings, are found at locations where magnetic elements with opposite polarities
are close to each other. They are likely linked with the dips of the serpentine mag-
netic ﬁeld through the surface (Pariat et al. 2004; Bello González et al. 2013). The
previous studies of EBs conclude that such photospheric heating processes are caused
by photospheric reconnection of strong opposite-polarity ﬁeld and are not directly
associated with chromosphere and transition region dynamics (e.g Watanabe et al.
2011; Vissers et al. 2013; Vissers et al. 2015).

Since the ﬁrst observational

report of granulation scale emergence events
(De Pontieu 2002), high-resolution polarimetric observations focus more frequently

on small-scale ﬂux emergence events together with observations of ﬂow motions. In
the high-resolution (∼0.′′32) observation of small-scale ﬂux emergence reported by
Centeno et al. (2007), by using analysis of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
inversion of full Stokes measurements, the author found horizontal ﬁeld emergence
prior to the appearance of vertical ﬂux elements in the typical granulation time scales
(10 minutes). With the advance of observational technology, the existence of ﬂux loops
have been witnessed (e.g., Martínez González & Bellot Rubio 2009; Tian et al. 2010).
By implementing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of magnetoconvection,
Moreno-Insertis et al. (2018) detected two types of ﬂux emergence events: magnetic
loop emergence and ﬂux sheet emergence. In previous observations of the ﬂux loop
emergence with Hinode (e.g., Centeno et al. 2007; Martínez González & Bellot Rubio
2009; Smitha et al. 2017), the authors summarized physical characteristics of the
the horizontal ﬁeld enhances within a well-established granule struc-
emergence:
ture followed by emerged vertical ﬁelds drifting in intergranular lanes. The verti-
cal ﬁeld elements are connected by horizontal magnetic patches. Recent studies by
Centeno et al. (2017) and Fischer et al. (2019) have reported the ﬂux-sheet emer-
gence events, which have diﬀerent signatures from ﬂux loop emergence. Instead of
evolving within granules, the horizontal ﬁeld enhances together with the expansion of
a granule. This forms an organized sheet-like mantle that spans both in the emerg-
ing direction and to sides. The sheet covers the entire granule, and the emerged
longitudinal ﬂux in footpoints is also in the order of 1018 Mx.

In this paper, we study the magnetic ﬁeld structure and evolution during the ﬂux
emergence in the NOAA active region (AR) 12665 on July 13, 2017. Taking advan-
tage of the exceptionally high resolution of the 1.6 m oﬀ-axis Goode Solar Telescope
(GST; Goode & Cao 2012) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), we are able to
observe ﬁne magnetic structures on sub-arcsecond level (0.′′1 to 0.′′2) and study the
magnetic properties in both ﬂux emergence scenarios as described above. We also
investigate photospheric and chromospheric brightness variation, especially Ellerman
bombs, associated with the small-scale ﬂux emergence. The structure of this paper
is as follows: We introduce our observations and data processing methods in Sec-
tion 2; In Section 3, we present analyses of observational results; Key ﬁndings are
summarized and discussions are presented in Section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING

As the Sun enters the activity minimum, observations of ARs are less often obtained.
On the other hand, with the routine operation of GST at BBSO, the quiet Sun and
less complicated ARs are more feasible targets. Aided by the high-order adaptive
optics system with 308 sub-apertures (Shumko et al. 2014) and completion of the
second generation of spectro-polarimetric instrument – the Near Infra-Red Imaging
Spectro-polarimeter (NIRIS) (Cao et al. 2012), BBSO/GST obtained observations
near the main magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) of NOAA AR 12665 (31◦W, 6◦S)

during ∼20:16–22:42 UT on 2017 July 13. Under the excellent seeing conditions, the
observations achieved diﬀraction-limited imaging with a resolution of 0.′′1 to 0.′′2. The
data includes spectro-polarimetric observations of full sets of Stokes measurement at
the Fe I 1564.8 nm line (0.25 Å bandpass) by NIRIS with a round ﬁeld of view (FOV)
of 80′′ at 0.′′24 resolution and 56 s cadence, Fabry-Pérot spectroscopic observations
around Hα line center at ± 1.0, ± 0.6, ± 0.4, and 0.0 Å (0.08 Å bandpass) by the
Visible Imaging Spectrometer (VIS) with a 70′′ circular FOV at 0.′′1 resolution and
33 s cadence, and images in TiO (705.7 nm; 10 Å bandpass) by the Broad-band
Filter Imager with a 70′′ circular FOV at 0.′′1 resolution and 15 s cadence. TiO and
Hα observations achieved a diﬀraction-limited resolution in the order of 0.′′1 with
speckle-masking image reconstruction (Wöger et al. 2008), while NIRIS achieves a
spatial resolution of 0.′′24 without speckle reconstruction.

Alignment among Hα images, TiO images, and magnetograms are processed by
matching the most stable sunspot and plage features in the FOV. After data noise de-
duction, the essential vector magnetograms from NIRIS are obtained through Stokes
inversion based on Milne-Eddington approximation (see Methods in Wang et al. 2017)
and aligned by using interpolation to achieve sub-pixel precision. Vector magne-
tograms in the local coordinates were deduced after removing the 180◦ azimuthal
ambiguity with the AUTO-AMBIG code by Leka et al. (2009a,b), which is an opti-
mized dis-ambiguation method originally intended for Hinode vector data. It uses
the minimum energy algorithm (Metcalf 1994) to ﬁnd a minimum of ﬁeld divergence
(∇·B) and current density (J) in the FOV. To assist in tracking magnetic elements
and quantiﬁcation of magnetic ﬂux, we applied the Southwest Automatic Magnetic
Identiﬁcation Suite (SWAMIS) (DeForest et al. 2007), which is a demonstrated tech-
nique for magnetic identiﬁcation and tracking. Here we set the threshold of the
vertical magnetic ﬁeld to 100 G. Based on visual inspection, this threshold allows us
to include as many detected magnetic elements as possible while maintaining a high
S/N ratio.

3. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
GST observation was centered at the ﬂare productive NOAA AR 12665 at (432′′,-
164′′). The AR is classiﬁed as the βγ magnetic conﬁguration. Figure 1 and the
online animations show an overview of the AR in magnetograms, TiO images, and
Hα images at +1.0 and −0.4 Å. During the period of observation, there is obvious
magnetic ﬂux emergence of opposite polarities at the main PIL. Emerging magnetic el-
ements actively diverge from the PILs and eventually merge into the nearby sunspots.
The TiO visible images clearly show that granules near the PIL exhibit elongating
patterns. Such evolving granular structures are typical photospheric signatures of
ﬂux emergence. Simultaneous magnetic ﬁeld measurements taken by NIRIS reveal
an enhanced horizontal ﬁeld accompanied by the elongating granules. Concentrated

magnetic elements of opposite polarities are located at the two ends of the central
region with the enhanced horizontal ﬁeld.

In Figure 1(b), the Hα image clearly exhibits brightenings at the footpoints of the
emerging ﬁbrils associated with the new ﬂux emergence and growing pores. The
green circles outline the locations of small-scale ﬂux emergences labeled 1 to 9. The
diameters of circles correspond to the size of the associated granules in TiO images.
The white dashed boxes F1 and F2 indicate the regions of events that we will discuss
in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The vertical component of magnetic ﬁelds is shown in Figure
1(a), which saturates at ±500 G. From the online TiO movie, one can see that the
magnetic ﬂux is transported to the photosphere through individual episodes in the
scale of granules during ﬂux emergence. Subsequently, the Sun’s pore areas are ex-
panded as the same polarity ﬂuxes are merged to them. From Hα oﬀ-band images,
ﬂows in dark ﬁbrils are observed streaming toward or away from the concentrated
magnetic footpoints.

During the observation time window, we identiﬁed eight good events (see Table 1)
of small-scale ﬂux emergence that have high-quality data in all wavelengths obtained.
The magnetic topology of event 5 can not be clearly interpreted because the magne-
tograms lack the accuracy of azimuthal disambiguation in this event area. For a simi-
lar reason, we exclude some emergence events seen in continuum images. Each of them
has an emerged total unsigned ﬂux in the order of 1018 Mx and shows prominent mag-
netic structure changes on the photosphere. The observed lifetime of these emergence
events is ∼10 minutes, which is on the same scale as the lifetime of granulation. Thus
the observed ﬂux emergence events are considered as granular-sized magnetic ﬂux
emergence. Diﬀerent magnetic characteristics are observed in these small-scale ﬂux
emergence events with high-resolution data. In the case studies of observed emergent
events, we are able to distinguish two diﬀerent types of ﬂux emergence processes, i.e.,
ﬂux sheet emergence and ﬂux loop emergence (e.g Martínez González & Bellot Rubio
2009; Centeno et al. 2017; Fischer et al. 2019). In the case studies of the observed
emergent events, the two types of ﬂux emergence events are categorized based on
geometric properties of the ﬁeld evolution and correspondent structure changes.

3.1. Detailed Study of a Flux Sheet Emergence

Since the observed emergence events are visible in granule-sized scale and often ad-
jacent to actively evolving granules, the clear event episodes are selected manually
after implementing the SWAMIS feature tracking method. In the ﬁve identiﬁed events
of ﬂux sheet emergence among all eight selected events, an enhanced horizontal ﬁeld
is seen to emerge within small granules as well as in the intergranular dark lane that
later forms a newly emerged granule cell. The emerging horizontal ﬁeld expands its
boundaries in the directions both along and across the ﬁeld lines while the ﬁeld lines
within granule cells are aligned between concentrated footpoints of opposite polari-
ties. We also found that on average the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld strength (265 G) is

6

Wang et al.

comparable with the vertical ﬁeld (272 G) in the emergent area as both are enhanced
during sheet emergence. Despite small variations in individual cases, the emerging
ﬂux expands its front at a speed of 1.5 km s−1(±0.55 km s−1). In event 1 we observed
the highest speed of emerged footpoints at 2.1 km s−1, and in event 8 we observed the
lowest speed at 0.8 km s−1. TiO images show that the photospheric granular struc-
tures associated with emerged footpoints’ separations undergo expansion during the
ﬂux emergence process, then follow the typical life cycle of photospheric granulation.
By reviewing the time-lapse movies of event 1 in multi-wavelengths, we identiﬁed
continuous ﬂux emergence and evolving granulation structure, which belong to the
ﬂux-sheet emergence type. The event 1 lasts ∼50 minutes, during which the TiO
images and horizontal magnetic ﬁeld maps clearly show two stages of the emergence
process. Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of magnetic and continuum structures
of this event. Figures 2(a1–a8) present snapshots of image sequence from 21:46 UT
to 22:06 UT of vertical ﬁeld superimposed with horizontal ﬁeld vectors, whose direc-
tions are represented by colors and magnitude is represented by arrow length. The
cutoﬀ value of the horizontal ﬁeld vectors is 100 G. Figures 2(b1–b8) show TiO im-
ages overlaid with the same horizontal ﬁeld vectors as in Figures 2(a1–a8). From
Figures 2(b3–b4), we clearly observe that the disoriented ﬁeld vectors overlap en-
tirely an expanding granule. Figures 2(c1–c8) present TiO images superimposed with
vertical magnetic elements, with the green (red) contours representing negative (pos-
itive) magnetic ﬁeld at a magnitude of 150 G. The concentrated magnetic elements
are seen to be located at the intergranular boundaries as new ﬂuxes emerge to the
photosphere (Jin et al. 2008). In the region where ﬂux emergence occurs (blue circle
in Figures 2(a3) and (b3)), concentrated magnetic elements divert along the inter-
granular lanes near the western edge of the region and eventually merge with pores of
the same polarities (as shown throughout Figures 2(a1–a8)). For a very short period
of ∼10 minutes (as seen in ﬁrst four columns in Figure 2), a granule cell appears
near the edge (centered at [X,Y]∼[5′′,5′′]) of a pre-existing granule and grows in the
circled region with the overlying horizontal ﬁeld emerging in the direction nearly per-
pendicular to the predominant direction of ambient ﬁelds. The translational motion
of negative magnetic elements along the intergranular lane is observed at the western
side of the circled area in Figures 2(a5–a7) and (c5–c7).

The background ﬁeld in the studied region is approximately in the east-west di-
rection. At the start of the time sequence in Figure 2, granulation is accompanied
with the growth of a new granule cell. Along with the disoriented granule expansion
occurrence (Figure 2(b3)), the accompanying horizontal ﬁeld emerges in an organized
direction diﬀerent from the pre-existing ﬁeld. The newly emerged horizontal ﬁeld
extends its boundary as it enhances in 8 minutes. In Figure 3, enhanced horizontal
ﬁeld patches are observed at ∼21:47 UT and two minutes later, the enhanced ﬁelds
reach the boundary of the co-spatial granule, where vertical magnetic ﬁelds concen-
trate into footpoints as indicated by the red and green contours (shown in Figures

EFR Observed by BBSO/GST

7

3(a4–a6)). The noticeable enhancement of the horizontal ﬁeld at the granule’s west
edge as seen in Figure 3(a5) is associated with a developing dark lane. When the
vertical ﬁeld is concentrated to the extended intergranular lanes as shown in Figure
2(a6), the horizontal ﬁeld continues to enhance (Figures 3(a5–a7)). The most promi-
nent enhancement covers the elongated granule and intergranular dark lane. From
the dopplergrams in Figures 3(b1–b8), both upﬂows and downﬂows are observed in
the ﬂux sheet area (centered at ∼[4′′,5′′] in Figures 3(b3–b4)). Strong Doppler blue-
shifts (red-shifts) with upﬂow (downﬂow) velocity up to 1.8 km s−1 are observed
at the positive (negative) footpoints in the intergranular lanes (centered at ∼[6′′,6′′]
in Figure 3(b6)). Very weak blue-shifts are seen within the granular cell (centered
∼[4′′,6′′] in Figure 3(b6)), where the average Doppler upﬂow velocity is ∼0.4 km s−1.
This is roughly two times smaller than that of emerging ﬂux in the previous study
of Centeno et al. (2017), and is also smaller than the average upﬂows (downﬂows) of
0.64 (0.49) km s−1 as found by Oba et al. (2017).

To further analyze the magnetic evolution associated with ﬂux emergence, we
present the time-distance diagrams of horizontal ﬁeld and TiO image in Figures 4(a)–
(d), which display the time-distance evolution of two slits across the ﬂux sheet and
along negative footpoint trail indicated in Figure 4(f) as red and yellow curves, respec-
tively. Figure 4(a) clearly shows the enhancement of horizontal ﬁeld in the expanding
granule, in which the separating bright lanes represent the emerging horizontal ﬁeld
with a magnitude over 150 G. The associated bi-directional extending granule bound-
aries are presented in Figure 4(b) based on TiO observations. The observations show
that the emergence in the granulation starts at 21:46 UT, when the horizontal ﬁeld
starts to increase from the background ﬁeld and ﬁlls the granule interior. The on-
going emergence lasts ∼15 minutes before dark intergranular lanes form in place at
∼22:02 UT. The concentrated footpoints (as indicated by the green contours in Fig-
ure 4(e)) at the boundary continue to evolve with an expansion speed of ∼1.7 km s−1.
Associated with the horizontal ﬁeld emergence in the transverse direction, the front
of the growing granule as indicated by TiO dark lanes (seen in Figure 4(b)) expands
at the same speed. The time-distance diagram (shown in Figure 4(c)) along the yel-
low slit indicates that the motion of the negative magnetic element resides in the
intergranular lane. Its speed of motion along the slit is 2 km s−1. Figure 4(d) shows
the co-spatial TiO evolution in the intergranular lane. Although granular boundaries
are observed as dark lanes in TiO images, we ﬁnd that the concentrated magnetic
elements are associated with transient TiO bright points. The negative magnetic
elements and the co-spatial TiO bright points drift together along the intergranular
lane. The horizontal ﬁeld in the ﬂux sheet emergence event 1 increases throughout
the 20 minutes evolution, reaching up to 450 G. The newly emerged vertical ﬂux at
the negative footpoint is 1.3× 1018 Mx.

3.2. Detailed Study of a Flux Loop Emergence

Wang et al.

On the other hand, in regions where events of emerging granules take place less often,
we observed dumbbell-like features in magnetograms representing ﬂux loop emergence
events, with two ends of loops rooted in opposite magnetic polarities. The emergence
of magnetic concentrations originates in the boundaries of neighboring granules and
then the emerged elements move along the magnetic network. A relatively weak ﬁeld
connects the two emerged footpoints. It is seen that the emerged magnetic footpoints
do not alter the overall evolution of their nearby granules. As shown in the online
movies, the passage of ﬂux loop footpoint motions shifts following the nearby granule
emergence and decay, which means that the merged ﬂux loop does not dominate the
local magnetic ﬁeld and structure evolutions. By comparing averaged ﬁeld strength
we found that the emerged vertical ﬁeld is 326 G, which is ∼120 G (60%) higher than
the emerged horizontal ﬁeld (∼200 G). We observe TiO and Hα brightenings more
often in this ﬂux loop type of emergence. In particular, all three events are seen to
be spatially associated with Hα brightenings near the emerged magnetic footpoints.
Event 2 (indicated by the box F2 in Figure 1) is one of the distinctive magnetic loop
type of ﬂux emergence in our observations, in which the emerging magnetic footpoints
travel in the network along intergranular dark lanes and are connected by an arched
magnetic ﬁeld. With the aid of Hα oﬀ-band images, we also observe Ellerman bombs
at the negative polarity footpoint and additional brightenings at the central location
in this event.

Figure 5 shows the temporal evolution of the elementary ﬂux emergence that forms
a magnetic loop conﬁguration using the magnetic and continuum observations. In the
snapshots of vector magnetic ﬁeld maps (as shown in Figures 5(a1–a4)), horizontal
ﬁeld vectors are superimposed on vertical ﬁelds and are also overplotted on TiO images
(Figures 5(b1–b4)). The direction of the horizontal ﬁeld is indicated by the direction
of the arrow and displayed in diﬀerent colors for each direction, and the positive
(negative) vertical ﬁeld is indicated by the white (black) background. Figures 5(c1–
c4) and Figures 5(d1–d4) show Hα images at +1.0 and −0.4 Å, respectively, with
the overplotted green (yellow) contours representing the negative (positive) magnetic
elements at the level of 150 G. From the image sequence and the online movie, we
can see consecutive episodes of ﬂux emergence during the time of observation in the
event 2 region.

Starting from 21:13 UT, a new pair of magnetic elements appear at ∼[4.′′5,3.′′5] (Fig-
ure 5(a1)). The concentrated magnetic elements of opposite polarities continue to

vector maps that the horizontal ﬁeld enhances in place with the emerged magnetic
elements and connects the diverging footpoints. A loop-like magnetic ﬁeld structure is
observed between the footpoints FP2 and FP3 at 21:46 UT, and the width of the ﬁeld
loop reaches ∼1′′ as observed for its horizontal ﬁeld component (Figure 8(a3)). There
is no obvious granular elongation observed to be associated with this horizontal ﬁeld
enhancement, while a deformed granule is accompanied by a transient magnetic en-

hancement between the footpoints FP2 and FP3 (see Figure 5(a3)). The diﬀuse ﬁeld
can also be observed in Figures 8(a1–a4), which show the horizontal ﬁeld map super-
imposed with vertical ﬁeld contours at the level of 150 G. The green and red contours
represent negative and positive magnetic elements, respectively. The Dopplergrams
in Figures 8(b1–b4) show obvious red-shifts at footpoints and two blue-shifted patches
connecting the footpoints at ∼21:35 UT. This indicates that the loop between foot-
points has an upward motion and the footpoints have downward ﬂows. The upﬂow
speed reaches up to 1.8 km s−1. The emerging magnetic footpoints start to cancel with
the preexisting magnetic ﬁelds of opposite polarities from 21:46 UT. Such conﬁgura-
tion of the emerged magnetic arc and the nearby preexisting footpoints in the north of
the region may indicate the emergence of an undulating ﬁeld in the emergence on the
photosphere. Adjoining footpoints of opposite polarities in the emergent undulating
ﬁeld can easily organize a U-shaped or Ω-shaped bald patch. According to previous
studies (e.g., Pariat et al. 2004; Toriumi et al. 2017), the photospheric locations of
bald patches of serpentine magnetic ﬁelds are very likely to be associated with EBs.
In the event 2, we witnessed bald patch associated EBs between the footpoints FP1
and FP2 (see Figure 5 a4 and c4), where the brightening in Hα wing occurs when the
magnetic concentrations of opposite polarities approach each other. The separation
of emerged magnetic footpoints eventually reaches a maximum distance of 5 Mm at
22:02 UT. In Figure 5(c4), Hα brightenings at +1.0 Å oﬀ-band are observed at the
magnetic footpoints ([2′′,7′′]) of the emerging ﬂux at 22:02 UT, when the magnetic
ﬂux cancellation occurs. At the same time, one can clearly observe a brightening in
Hα −0.4 Å centered at ∼[4′′,3′′] (Figure 5(d4)) between the magnetic footpoints.

The time-distance diagrams in Figure 6 display bidirectional motions of the emerg-
ing magnetic elements. Similar phenomena were reported by Yang et al. (2016) with
TiO broadband ﬁlter images. The slit cuts along the extending magnetic loop as
shown with the yellow curve in Figure 6(c). Based on the time-distance diagrams, the
magnetic footpoints diverge at a speed of 0.6–1.4 km s−1, which is much slower than
previous results (3.8 km s−1 in Yang et al. 2016). While the vertical ﬁelds follow con-
ﬁned separating traces, slightly weaker horizontal ﬁelds develop between the extending
front of the horizontal ﬁeld as seen in Figure 6(b). This is consistent with the obser-
vation from vector magnetic ﬁeld maps that the magnetic footpoints are connected
by diﬀused horizontal ﬁelds (Centeno et al. 2007; Martínez González & Bellot Rubio
2009).

To understand the relationship between ﬂux emergence and Hα brightenings, we
plot the temporal evolution of footpoint magnetic ﬂux, Hα intensities at −0.4 Å and
+1.0 Å, and horizontal ﬁeld strength in Figure 7. Figure 7(a) shows the averaged
vertical ﬂux in the positive (negative) footpoints as a red (blue) curve. Figure 7(b)
shows the normalized intensity of Hα −0.4 and +1.0 Å in the central loop (blue)
and footpoint (red) regions, respectively. Figure 7(c) shows averaged horizontal ﬁeld

emergence, there is no visible Hα response, while we observe brightenings in the
loop corresponding to the second horizontal ﬁeld increase starting from 21:46 UT.
Comparing the light curves of the horizontal ﬁeld at diﬀerent locations, we ﬁnd that
the ﬁeld strength increases at footpoints while decreases in the loop at ∼22:02 UT,
which is co-temporal with Hα brightenings. Meanwhile, the vertical ﬂux increases
at the negative polarity footpoint. We speculate that Hα brightenings in the loop
are produced by the magnetic reconnection between the newly emerged magnetic
loop with the overlying background ﬁeld. On the other hand, the Hα brightenings at
footpoints are likely to be signatures of EBs between FP1 and FP2 (see Figure 5(a3)).
The LOS velocity maps of event 2 in Figure 8(b1)-(b4) show that the central loop and
magnetic footpoints of the emerged ﬂux loop is clearly associated with bi-directional
shifts. At 21:13 UT, the velocity of blue-shift corresponding to the emerging loop is
0.45 km s−1. It increases to 0.98 km s−1 at 21:28 UT then decreases to 0.37 km s−1
at 21:46 UT. The separating footpoints are observed to experience red-shifts with a
maximum speed of 1.3 km s−1 at 21:28 UT.

3.3. Properties of Other Events

Starting from 21:00 UT, with best-seeing quality of the day, we observe other small-
scale ﬂux emergence cases in ∼70 minutes, which demonstrate similar magnetic prop-
erties. The derived parameters of magnetic ﬁeld evolution observed in nine events are
given in Table 1, including horizontal ﬁeld, vertical ﬁeld, vertical ﬂux increments, the
maximum distance of emerging bipolar magnetic elements, correspondent separation
speed, LOS Doppler velocities, and associated EB occurrence. The maximum dis-
tance and correspondent average speed are measured in the emergence phase, which
starts from the emergence of opposite polarities till both separation and ﬂux enhance-
ment cease. As listed in Table 1, ﬁve of the eight selected events in the observation
can be categorized as a ﬂux sheet type of emergence. We ﬁnd that although the time
interval between horizontal ﬁeld emergence and the corresponding expanding gran-
ule boundaries is within 10 minutes, which is at the same time scale as summarized
in previous studies (Centeno et al. 2017; Moreno-Insertis et al. 2018), magnetic ele-
ments in the granule boundaries continue to enhance as horizontal ﬁeld increases and
then either merge with adjacent magnetic ﬁelds or cancel with elements of opposite
polarities. The ﬂux sheet emergence events 1 and 8 are observed to originate from
intergranular dark lanes and form new expanding granular cells in the emergence
locations. While the other three emergent ﬂux sheets (events 3, 7, and 9) do not
show a direct linkage to pre-existing intergranular dark lanes, they are found to be
located near the newly formed pores. The vertical ﬂux brought into the solar surface
through emergence, which is associated with the expanding granules, is in the range
of 0.9–11.6× 1018 Mx. As the edge of the emerging magnetic ﬁeld that envelopes the
granule expands at a speed of 1.5 km s−1, the granule cells undergoing emergence
are averaged 4.′′.3, which grow by 0.7–1.5′′. Although we observed a close connec-

tion between magnetic ﬂux emergence and changes of photospheric granule structure,
Hα brightenings are rarely observed to be associated with ﬂux sheet emergence. Hα
bright bursts captured in the event 9 region are closely associated with magnetic ﬂux
cancellation starting from 20:16 UT. During its emergence, TiO brightening at the
granular boundary is observed at 21:36 UT.

Summarizing the ﬂux loop cases, we ﬁnd that the vertical ﬂux enhancement in this
type of events is 3.0±0.9× 1018 Mx.while the separation speed of the emerging loop
footpoints is 1.2 km s−1, which is similar to the expanding speed of horizontal ﬁeld in
ﬂux sheet emergence, the maximum distance of opposite polarities reaches 5.5±1.5′′.
The diﬀerence of maximum separation is consistent with ﬂux sheet and loop topology
as magnetic footpoints of emerging ﬂux loops are expected to extend further in the
granular network. Despite that Hα brightenings are observed in event 2 at end of
the ﬂux emergence, the most prominent Hα response occurred 38 minutes later. In
the other two ﬂux loop emergence events (event 4 and 6), we also observed Hα
brightenings close to the emerged footpoints of these two events, while time intervals
In event 6 Hα
between emergence and Hα brightenings do not show a similarity.
brightenings are observed three minutes after loop emergence. Among the studied
events, ﬁve events are spatially associated with Hα brightenings, including all three
ﬂux loop emergence and two ﬂux sheet emergence. From Doppler velocity maps of
the ﬂux emergence events, we ﬁnd that the active region generally shows an upﬂow
of 0.8 km s−1 in the background. Three of the listed emergence events (events 3-5)
have blue-shifts over 2 km s−1, which is comparable to previous observational results
of photospheric Doppler velocity (Ortiz et al. 2014). Event 5 is excluded from the
categorization of magnetic topology because azimuthal ambiguity is not well resolved
at the event location and Doppler red-shift is observed between opposite polarities.
It is interpreted as a U-shaped ﬁeld.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In this paper, we have presented a detailed study of small-scale ﬂux emergence near
the central PIL of NOAA AR 12665 on 2017 July 13. The study is particularly focused
on magnetic characteristics of two diﬀerent kinds of ﬂux emergence derived using the
near-infrared polarimetric data obtained by NIRIS at BBSO/GST. In addition, we
studied photospheric evolution and chromospheric responses to the ﬂux emergence
using TiO and Hα time-sequence images. Our main results are summarized below.

1. In event 1, a typical sheet emergence case, an organized sheet-like structure
of enhancing horizontal magnetic ﬂux is seen to span over an entire granule,
which expands at a speed of 1.6 km s−1. The magnitude of the horizontal ﬁeld
in the ﬂux sheet increases for ∼20 minutes, reaching up to 450 G. The emerged
ﬂux at footpoints reaches ∼1.8× 1018 Mx. In a subsequent second stage, the
negative polarity footpoints and the co-spatial TiO bright points move along
the intergranular lanes at a speed of ∼2 km s−1.

2. In event 2, a typical loop emergence case, magnetic footpoints at the two ends
(the concentrated opposite-polarity ﬂux component) emerge and move in the
intergranular lanes with a separation speed of 1.2–1.7 km s−1; meanwhile, a
horizontal ﬁeld lying in-between enhances, forming elongated, loop-like struc-
tures (the central diﬀused component). The positive vertical ﬂux increases by
∼0.5× 1018 Mx. Later at ∼22:00 UT, horizontal ﬁeld decreases in the central
loop region while it increases at footpoint regions.

3. Analysis of extended samples shows that all the eight events have a strongly
emerged horizontal ﬁeld of ∼450 G at maximum. While in the ﬂux sheet emer-
gence vertical ﬁeld is comparable with the horizontal ﬁeld(∼270 G), in the loop
emergence vertical ﬁeld is 120 G stronger than the horizontal ﬁeld. In the ﬁve
ﬂux sheet emergence events, the horizontal ﬁeld enhances and hovers the emer-
gent granule cells as the granules grow. The concentration of ﬁeld strength in
the granule boundaries at the late phase of the emergence is observed in both
horizontal and vertical magnetograms. Three out of the eight emergence events
are observed to have a magnetic loop topology, in which the emergence of mag-
netic elements happens in intergranular lanes. The loop-like emergence carries
∼1018 Mx of ﬂux to the surface.

The results of the two types of ﬂux emergence, with one experiencing an enhanced
horizontal ﬁeld hovering over the granule and the other following the typical Ω–loop
conﬁguration, have advanced our understandings of small-scale ﬂux emergence and
formation of active regions. It is worth noting that observations of ﬂux-sheet emer-
gence in both active regions (Centeno et al. 2017) and quiet Sun (Fischer et al. 2019)
are rare. The numerical study by Moreno-Insertis et al. (2018) suggested that the oc-
currence rate of loop-like emergence (1–3 day−1 Mm−2) is ∼3 times higher than that
of the sheet-like events (0.3–1 day−1 Mm−2) in the quiet Sun. In our study, we found
more frequent occurrence of ﬂux-sheet emergence events (1.8±0.1 day−1 Mm−2) than
of loop-like emergence (1.1±0.06 day−1 Mm−2). We suspect that in the active region
sub-surface magnetic tubes rising up to solar surface can break their original bipolar
structure and emerge sideways due to the active and dynamic transverse motions.
Frequent granulation observed in the active region provides higher opportunity than
in quiet Sun to have magnetic tubes emerge with growing granules, which eventu-
ally form an emerging ﬂux sheet. In comparison with a previous study, Fischer et al.
(2019) observed that the transverse ﬂux density reaches up to 194 Mxcm−2, cor-
responding to a maximum horizontal ﬁeld of ∼300 G. Our results show that the
horizontal ﬁeld reaches up to 450 G while the total ﬂux is comparable to previous
studies. Based on our results, ﬁve out of the eight observed ﬂux emergence episodes
in the FOV follow the ﬂux-sheet type of emergence, and the rest follows the loop
type emergence. Further, the ﬂux sheets often appear in the emergence sites that
are closely associated with newly evolving granulations. Such a preference leads us

EFR Observed by BBSO/GST

to speculate that not only magnetic buoyancy instability but also transverse tension
contribute to the ﬂux-sheet emergence. In both types of ﬂux emergence, the max-
imum distance of footpoint separation and speed of Doppler shift vary with cases.
Base on the results of our analyzed events, we conclude that despite diﬀerences in
magnetic ﬁeld topology and ﬁeld strength distribution, the ﬂux sheet and ﬂux loop
emergences share some similarities in terms of the emerging process. As an indication
of Ellerman bombs, Hα brightenings in our observations are found to have a close
connection with magnetic loop emergence, in which the migrating footpoints collide
and cancel with elements of opposite polarity in the intergranular lanes.

The magnetic-loop emergences observed by us may evolve in the form of an undu-
lating serpentine ﬁeld. The three conﬁrmed loop type emergences are observed in the
magnetic intranetwork. As magnetic footpoints diverge along the intergranular lanes,
the emergent horizontal ﬁeld is observed to enhance the ﬁeld strength of network in
magnetograms with correspondent dark lanes seen in TiO images. Despite diﬀerent
emergence topology, the total emerged magnetic ﬂux in the loop emergence events is
comparable with that in the ﬂux-sheet emergence events, and is an order of magnitude
higher than previous studies of granule-sized magnetic loops (Gömöry et al. 2010).
As presented in the sample event 2, the magnetic footpoints of opposite polarities
originate within neighboring granules and move apart along the intergranular lanes.
Thus as they approach the adjacent footpoints of the emerged ﬁeld, a U-shaped ﬁeld
line can be formed across the surface. Such magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is one type
of bald patches that are found to have a strong connection with EBs (Pariat et al.
2004; Jiang et al. 2017). Vissers et al. (2015) found that similar to EBs, ﬂaring arch
ﬁlaments could also exist in the emerging active region but are often observed as
brightenings at Hα core. This phenomenon is believed to be related to the reconnec-
tion of curved ﬁelds. In comparison, our results in Section 3.2 reveal Hα brightenings
at the central loop location (in −0.4 Å) as well as at the footpoints (in +1.0 Å). These
may be interpreted as the reconnection between the emerging ﬂux loop (footpoints)
with the pre-existing overlying ﬁeld (opposite polarity elements).

In summary, with high-resolution and high-cadence vector data, we have studied
small-scale ﬂux emergence from the observational perspective. We conﬁrm that mag-
netic ﬁelds of granule-sized ﬂux emergence have two diﬀerent topologies, magnetic
loop and ﬂux sheet. The primary diﬀerence of magnetic properties between the two
types of emergence is that the magnetic ﬁeld of ﬂux sheets tend to be more inclined

enings are more favorable to the footpoints of the emerging magnetic loops. Also,
despite their diﬀerent locations in the observed AR, both types of emergence bring
1–6× 1018 Mx of ﬂux to the solar atmosphere.

Figure 4. Time-space diagram of event 1. Panels (a) and (b) show time-space diagrams
of horizontal ﬁeld and TiO along the red slit as shown in (f), which correspond to ﬂux sheet
emergence stage. Green lines in (a) and (b) trace the expanding granule. Panels (c) and
(d) show time-space diagrams of vertical ﬁeld and TiO along the yellow slit as shown in (f),
which represent negative footpoint motions in the intergranular lane. Red lines in (c) and
(d) trace and are used to estimate speed of motion of the magnetic element. Green (red)
contours in (e) and (f) outline the concentrated negative (positive) magnetic elements.

Figure 8. Horizontal ﬁeld and dopplergrams in event 2. Panels (a) show horizon-
tal ﬁeld map superimposed with vertical ﬁeld contours at level of 150 G. Panels (b) show
upﬂows (downﬂows) of Dopplergrams in blue (red) color. The line-of-sight component the
correspondent velocity is in range of ±3.0 km s−1. Panels (c) present TiO images superim-
posed with horizontal ﬁeld contours at levels of 200 G and 400 G, indicated by dark and
light blue, respectively. The green (red) contours in (a) and (b) represent magnetic elements
of negative (positive) polarity at level of 150 G. The red arrow in (a3) indicates horizontal
component of the magnetic loop. The yellow arrows in (b2) indicate Doppler blue-shifts
between the magnetic footpoints. An animation the horizontal ﬁeld and dopplergrams in
event 2 is available in the online Journal. The animated Figure, which includes the same
panels (a)-(c) shown here, runs from 21:03 to 22:16 UT.
