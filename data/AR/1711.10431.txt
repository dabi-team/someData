We consider the process of pumping charge through an open quantum system, motivated by the
example of a quantum dot with strong repulsive or attractive electron-electron interaction. Using
the geometric formulation of adiabatic nonunitary evolution put forward by Sarandy and Lidar,
we derive an encompassing approach to ideal charge measurements of time-dependently driven
transport, that stays near the familiar approach to closed systems. Following Schaller, Kießlich and
Brandes we explicitly account for a meter that registers the transported charge outside the system.
The gauge freedom underlying geometric pumping eﬀects in all moments of the transported charge
emerges naturally as the calibration of this meter. Remarkably, we ﬁnd that geometric and physical
considerations cannot be applied independently as done in closed systems: physical recalibrations
do not form a group due to constraints of positivity (Bochner’s theorem). This complication goes
unnoticed when considering only the average charge but it is relevant for understanding the origin
of geometric eﬀects in the higher moments of the charge-transport statistics. As an application we
derive two prominent existing approaches to pumping, based on full-counting-statistics (FCS) and
adiabatic-response (AR), respectively, from our approach in a transparent way. This allows us to
reconcile all their apparent incompatibilities, in particular the puzzle how for the average charge
the nonadiabatic stationary-state AR result can exactly agree with the adiabatic nonstationary FCS
result. We relate this and other diﬃculties to a single characteristic of geometric approaches to open
systems: the system-environment boundary can always be chosen to either include or exclude the
ideal charge meter. This leads to a physically motivated relation between the mixed-state Berry
phase and the entirely diﬀerent geometric phase of Landsberg.

INTRODUCTION

A. Geometric phases in open systems

In condensed matter physics geometric and topologi-
cal quantities are generally appreciated for their robust-
ness against perturbations. In physics, topological quan-
tities often arise from geometric ones and the former
have been used to classify phases of isolated solids at
zero temperature1–11. Recently, this topological classi-
ﬁcation has also been addressed for ﬁnite temperature
and nonequilibrium12–14 which is more challenging since
it requires a description in terms of mixed-state density
operators9,15–17 rather than pure-state vectors. There
is, however, a further complicating factor for such open
systems: due to the diversity of kinetic equations that de-
scribe their nonunitary dynamics there is a much wider
variety of geometric formulations18–21 than for closed sys-
tems which are all described by the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion. Despite this strong impetus to establish relations
between geometric approaches in open systems, little at-
tention has been given to such comparisons so far22,23.

An important issue that is currently being addressed
in several of the above works9,12–17,24 is to ﬁnd observ-

ables that are sensitive to given geometric and topologi-
cal quantities that one deﬁnes for an open system. Some
works22,25–28 follow an opposite line of questioning by
ﬁrst focusing on observable transport eﬀects and then ex-
pressing these in geometric terms. Identifying geometric
quantities this way, even in relatively simple open sys-
tems, seems an essential ﬁrst step towards ﬁnding eﬀects

indicative of topological order.
pumping, i.e., transport due to slow periodic driving, was
found to probe geometry and topology and one might
expect the same for open systems. However, as we re-
cently highlighted23, the geometric phases that one en-
counters for pumping through open quantum systems do
not relate to the reduced quantum state of the system
(obtained by tracing out the environment): instead, ex-
ternal observables –or related generating functions– accu-
mulate these geometric phases. Another issue concerns
two prominent open-system approaches that deal with
pumping in this way, the adiabatic-response approach
(AR) and the full counting statistics (FCS): Despite their
completely opposite features they were shown to give
identical results for the average pumped charge22,23. Rec-
onciling these features requires a deeper understanding
of the distinction between geometric phases in open and
closed quantum systems and motivates the present work.

on the driving parameters, collected in a vector R,

ˆNg(R) = ˆN + g(R)1,
without altering the pumped charge23,43. Physically, this
is a literal gauge, i.e., a recalibration of the scale used for
reading out a charge meter. These physical gauge trans-
formations fully explain the emergence of a geometric
ﬁrst moment M(1) := (cid:104) ˆN (cid:105)(T ) − (cid:104) ˆN (cid:105)(0) upon driving the
parameters during one period T . However, driven trans-
port also involves geometric eﬀects for higher moments
M(k) such as the pumping noise36 related to (cid:104) ˆN 2(cid:105). The
calibration freedom (1) does not explain their occurrence
and so far it has remained unclear which further physical
gauge freedom is responsible for this.

One should note that the computation of the aver-
age transported charge requires a memory-kernel for the
observable (in addition to a state-evolution kernel) be-
cause the reservoirs and meter have been integrated out.
It was shown that through this latter observable kernel
the gauge freedom Eq. (1), responsible for the geometric
pumping phase, enters the problem. Also, the nonzero
value of this phase could be directly tied to the retarded
response (“lag”) of the current through the system to the
driving parameters as measured by an outside observable:
the pumping current is therefore nonadiabatic.

As highlighted in Ref. 23 the AR approach has the ad-
vantage of leading to technically simple calculations, pro-
ducing such examples as Fig. 2, while at the same time
tying geometric quantities to concrete transport physics.
For example, the geometric connection equals the physi-
cal pumping current. However, even without going into
detail, one notices that the features of this approach,
listed in Table I, go against virtually all familiar ideas
about the appearance of geometric phases in closed quan-
tum systems (adiabaticity, quantum-state phase accumu-
lation, Berry-Simon type connection, etc.). This paper
addresses the important question how and to what ex-
tent this familiar picture can be restored by starting from
a diﬀerent, yet equivalent, formulation.
In particular,
how does the phase-accumulation of the charge observ-
able emerge from the phase of some quantum state?

(b) Meter inside. Another prominent approach to
pumping proceeds as sketched in Fig. 1(b):
the me-
ter is part of the open system (not integrated out).
The FCS approach keeps track of the meter by a for-
mal counting-ﬁeld parameter φ, a statistical tool48. The
charge-transfer statistics is computed from a generating
function Z φ via a generating-operator ρφ which describes
the ﬁrst cumulant C(1) := (cid:104) ˆN (cid:105)(T ) − (cid:104) ˆN (cid:105)(0) but also all
higher cumulants C(k). Sinitsyn and coworkers applied
this approach to the problem of pumping22,28,45,46,49,50
and by an adiabatic decoupling obtained a result for
the cumulant generating function zφ = ln Z φ which is
nonstationary for ﬁxed parameters. For each continu-
ous value of φ it has a pumping contribution that is a
geometric phase of the Berry-Simon type51,52. The geo-
metric part of the ﬁrst cumulant C(1) is the measurable
pumped charge and it is plotted in Fig. 2 for our example.

Equivalent ways of accounting for charge pump-

ment, together with the electrodes, all of which are traced out
(hatched). (b) Meter inside: the meter is considered as part

The key questions can be outlined further, guided by
the role of a meter that registers the charge ˆN without
backaction1: either the meter lies outside (a) or inside
(b) the open-system boundary as sketched in Fig. 1.

(a) Meter outside.

Steady-state pumping through
an open quantum system has been studied in the way
sketched in Fig. 1(a) in several works25,26,31–38. In Ref. 23
it was shown, that in this approach geometric pumping
eﬀects do not result from a geometric phase of the state
(reduced density operator). Indeed, when computing this
phase in the steady state limit, it turns out to be zero. In-
stead, the pumped charge per period was shown to equal
a single Landsberg-type geometric phase39–43 that arises
naturally when computing the adiabatic response25 (AR)
of the current that is linear in the velocity of the driving
parameters.

For concreteness, we show two examples for such
charge pumping in Fig. 2, which can both be ac-
cessed with this formalism.
Interestingly, in these ex-
amples pumping is generated by strong interaction ef-
fects22,28,33,36,43–47 which in the weak coupling limit
can readily be treated using the open-system (density-
operator) approach. The geometric origin of the pump-
ing was shown to lie in the nonuniqueness of assigning
an operator to an observable measured outside 2 the open
system, i.e., in the hatched area in Fig. 1(a): One is free
to add to the charge operator an oﬀset g that depends

1 Integrating out the meter is equivalent to having no meter at all.
2 Applied to system observables this also covers23 the Kato-

projection approach of Avron, Fraas, and Graf27,34.

The features of the FCS approach listed in Table I are
similar to the closed-system geometric approach. How-
it is not clear to which
ever, this similarity is formal:
physical state the adiabaticity and geometric phase refer.
This is a serious concern –raised already in Ref. 22– since
by its adiabatic decoupling approximation the FCS ap-
proach to pumping (correctly) produces the same result
as the AR approach, in which the current is undeniably
nonadiabatic23, see Fig. 2. In fact, all the features of the
FCS and AR approach listed in Table I seem to be in
conﬂict. Nevertheless, for the ﬁrst moment / cumulant
they produce identical results within their limits of appli-
cability as shown in detailed analyses22,23. These latter
works, however, do not give a simple explanation or, even
better, a single systematic approach that rationalizes all
their diﬀerences in a simple and transparent way.

A further question that received little attention so far
relates to the full set of moments / cumulants, i.e., the en-
tire transport process. It is an advantage of the FCS ap-
proach that it gives a formal expression for all cumulants
C(k) of the transported charge which shows that they all
have a geometric contribution. However, their proper-
ties have not been discussed much. In particular, as we
will see here, the geometric gauge transformations may
transform proper generating functions to functions that
violate Bochner’s positivity criterion55,
implying their
inverse Fourier transforms take negative values and do
not correspond to charge-transfer probability distribu-
tions anymore, cf. Ref. 56. The nontrivial positivity re-
striction is typical of the open-system (density-operator)
setting and its interplay with geometric considerations
requires clariﬁcation if gauge transformations aﬀecting
the higher moments are to be understood physically.

B. This paper

Motivated by the above, we relate in this paper the
charge pumping process to geometric phases of the adia-
batically evolving mixed quantum state. We achieve this
by including an ideal charge meter in the total system
sketched in Fig. 1(c) following Schaller et al.57 and by
applying the adiabatic (mixed-)state evolution (ASE) ap-
proach, developed by Sarandy and Lidar20,21. Geometric
pumping through an open quantum system can then be
understood in a formulation that stays near the estab-
lished intuition of the familiar closed-system formalism.
We hereby go beyond3 recent discussions of the tech-
nical equivalence of pumping approaches22,23. From our
new vantage point both the AR and FCS approach to
pumping can be derived and understood transparently:
all their opposing features, listed in Table I, can be tied

3 Although in Ref. 23 the ASE approach20,21 also played a role, it
was not applied to the composite system-plus-meter state which
is the crucial advance that we report here.

to a single characteristic of open-system descriptions,
namely, that the boundary between system and environ-
ment can be redrawn to include [Fig. 1(a)] or exclude
[Fig. 1(b)] the meter, thereby completely altering the
physical and geometrical description at every step, but
without changing the ﬁnal technical outcome. This com-
prehensive comparison has never been done and is im-
portant for the various reasons that we outlined above.
Most prominently, we directly tie the physical origin
of geometric eﬀects on the entire pumping process to the
simple fact that a physical meter can be recalibrated.
This generalizes an earlier result23 restricted only to the
pumped charge (ﬁrst moment) to the entire transport
process (all moments). We show that this is the origin of
geometric pumping eﬀects both in the FCS and AR ap-
proach, despite all their diﬀerences. In particular, in the
FCS this point becomes clear when treating the counting
ﬁeld as the physical momentum conjugate to the meter
charge. We furthermore ﬁnd the announced nontrivial
conﬂict between the physical positivity requirements and
geometric considerations that one does not encounter in
closed quantum systems: physical meter calibrations do
not form a transformation subgroup of the full group of
allowed geometric gauges.

On a more general level our ﬁndings highlight that tak-
ing measurements explicitly into account is important for
the geometric and –a fortiori – the topological characteri-
zation of open systems. Also, by explicitly accounting for
the meter, our approach provides a suitable starting point
for consideration of more complicated situations than ad-
dressed in this paper where nonideal aspects of the charge
measurement process need to be included, such as back-
action and spontaneous charge-symmetry breaking in su-
perconducting systems.

C. Outline.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we intro-
duce a Hamiltonian model which includes an ideal meter

as sketched in Fig. 1(c). Integrating out the reservoirs,
as in Fig. 1(b), we set up a master equation for the com-
posite quantum state of system plus meter and carefully
discuss which momentum (counting-ﬁeld) is actually con-
jugate to the charge registered by the meter. Then, in
Sec. III we outline the adiabatic state-evolution (ASE)
approach of Sarandy and Lidar20,21 to open systems
and show in Sec. IV how it describes the entire charge-
pumping process when applied to the composite system-
plus-meter state. This provides the basis for resolving all
mentioned concerns regarding AR and FCS approach:
in Sec. V, we show how our ASE approach to system-
plus-meter dynamics –through standard, calibrated mea-
surements on the meter– naturally includes the FCS ap-
proach which focuses on charge-transfer statistics. All
features of the FCS approach, in particular, the adia-
baticity, can be clearly understood physically by consid-
ering the system plus meter.
In Sec. VI we show how
our approach also naturally leads to the AR approach
–with its completely opposite feature list– by going to
a reduced description in which the meter is integrated
out as in Fig. 1(a). This allows us to explain in par-
ticular how the less familiar Landsberg geometric phase
for the observable in the AR approach emerges physically
from the more familiar Berry-Simon geometric phase of
the composite state of system-plus-meter. We summarize
our ﬁndings in Sec. VII and indicate how the key ideas
presented can be extended beyond the simple limits that
we intentionally focus on here for purpose of clarity.

II. MODEL, METER AND MASTER EQUATION

Hamiltonian model.

In Fig. 1(c) we sketch a model
of an ideal meter that we introduce following Schaller
et al.57. In order to count the net number of electrons
entering one of the reservoirs, say the left one, we extend
the system plus reservoirs by a suitable Hilbert space
to model a meter. This can be any space spanned by an
inﬁnite discrete set of orthonormal vectors {|N (cid:105), N ∈ Z}.

When an electron enters (leaves) the left reservoir one
“counts” by changing the meter state from |N (cid:105) → |N ±1(cid:105).
The charge operator on the meter thus reads

∞
(cid:88)

ˆN =

N =−∞

N |N (cid:105)(cid:104)N |.

(2)

Through this formal trick we are able to explicitly keep
track of observable operators outside the system even af-
ter integrating out the reservoirs below.

We assume the meter is ideal in the sense that it has no
internal dynamics (zero Hamiltonian). As a result, the
choice of the meter-space is nonunique: it is possible to
shift |N (cid:105) → |N −η(cid:105) by any integer η ∈ Z without altering
the construction (translational invariance). Later we will
see that there is a further nontrivial physical gauge free-
dom at this point in the choice of the meter states, see
Eq. (61). The charges are counted instantaneously and
without backaction on the rest of the system: when later
[Eq. (82a)] on we discard the measurements on the meter
(by tracing over the meter space) the reduced system evo-
lution is not modiﬁed by the presence of the meter. This
ideal coupling of the meter to the transported charge is
implemented in the dynamics by replacing the electron
ﬁeld operators in the tunnel-coupling Hamiltonian of the
left reservoir by a tensor product

c → c ⊗ ei ˆφ,

c† → c† ⊗ e−i ˆφ,

(3)

with phase operators acting on the meter space (η = ±)

eiη ˆφ =

∞
(cid:88)

|N (cid:105)(cid:104)N + η| =

∞
(cid:88)

|N − η(cid:105)(cid:104)N |.

(4)

N =−∞

N =−∞

We note that this construction works for any tunnel cou-
pling model – not just for bilinear ones as considered in
Ref. 57. Physically, ˆN is the position operator of the nee-
dle on an unlimited charge scale of an ideal meter and ˆφ
is its conjugate momentum ((cid:126) = 1):

[ ˆN , ˆφ] = i.

(5)

Thus, ˆN → ∂iφ when acting on phase eigenkets4 |φ(cid:105) :=
(cid:80)
N eiN φ|N (cid:105). This phase operator is well known in su-
perconductivity58–60 and in the P (E)-theory of electro-
magnetic ﬂuctuations of electric circuits coupled to quan-
tum dots61–63. The operator (4) “kicks” the meter by one
unit −η = ± for every charge that tunnels to / from the
left reservoir (out of / into the system). Charge trans-
port is measured outside the system by projective mea-
surements of the meter observable ˆN , producing a statis-
tics of outcomes N from which the expectation values of

ˆN |φ(cid:105) = (cid:80)
N N eiφN |N (cid:105) = ∂iφ|φ(cid:105). The action on a wavefunc-
tion (cid:104)φ| ˆN |ψ(cid:105) = (cid:80)
N N e−iφN (cid:104)φ|ψ(cid:105) = −∂iφ(cid:104)φ|ψ(cid:105) has the oppo-
site sign. The latter is needed to verify Eq. (5), (cid:104)φ|[ ˆN , ˆφ]|ψ(cid:105) =
−∂iφφ(cid:104)φ|ψ(cid:105) + φ∂iφ(cid:104)φ|ψ(cid:105) = i(cid:104)φ|ψ(cid:105), but is avoided otherwise.

powers (cid:104) ˆN (cid:105), (cid:104) ˆN 2(cid:105), etc. can be computed. By measuring
these at two diﬀerent times, all moments and cumulants
of the charge transfer (full counting statistics) can be de-
termined, see App. A and App. B.

Calling this a “meter” emphasizes its ideal detection
aspects which allow us to incorporate it inside an open
system, i.e., even when integrating out the reservoirs.
This is suﬃcient to clarify the issues at the focus of the
paper. We stress that it is not intended as a realistic
model of measurements, but simply makes explicit what
one assumes when using any of the approaches discussed
in the paper (ASE, FCS, AR) to compute pumping ef-
fects. For concreteness we assume that the model of the
total system in Fig. 1(c) takes the form

H tot =H ⊗ 1 +

where H is the system Hamiltonian. Reservoir r is de-
scribed by the noninteracting Hamiltonian H r and has
temperature T , electrochemical potential µr and density
of states νr. The last line assumes bilinear coupling and
for the left reservoir includes the counting of electrons
entering the dot (η = +) and leaving the dot (η = −).

Master-equation. By explicitly including the meter,
we go back to the way FCS of transport was originally
conceived56,64. However, the following is not a mere red-
erivation of FCS: we go beyond Ref. 57 by introducing
charge and phase super operators in order to relate the
geometry of the pumping process to meter calibrations.
Moreover, we consider driving of the Hamiltonian (6)
which is slow in the sense that the velocity of the dimen-
sionless parameters R(t) is small relative to the transport
rates ( ˙R := | ˙R| (cid:28) Γ). For simplicity we also make the
weak-coupling approximation (Γ (cid:28) T ) and the frozen-
parameter approximation (memory kernel K below is in-
˙R) which is suﬃcient for computing the
dependent of
linear-response in ˙R. See Ref. 23 for a detailed discus-
sion of these steps and also Sec. VII. After tracing out
only the reservoirs57 we obtain a Born-Markov master
equation for the density operator |||ρ(t)))) for system plus

the total system65: in the eigenbasis of H the diagonal density
matrix elements decouple from the oﬀ-diagonal ones.

Charge and phase superoperator. Because the reser-
voirs which we eliminated are normal metals (charge-
diagonal state), in the last term of (9) the system su-
peroperators K L,η are combined with the phase su-
per operator Φ:

This superoperator “kicks” the meter by −η = ±1 and
thereby counts the charge on the reservoir. Due to its
central importance below it deserves some comments. We
have written (functions of) pure-state projections as su-
per(co)vectors:

|||N))) := |N (cid:105)(cid:104)N |,
(((N|||• := Tr

(|N (cid:105)(cid:104)N |•) = (cid:104)N | • |N (cid:105),

where TrM denotes the trace of an operator acting on
the meter space. (Only for |||N))), and below |||N, k))), |||φ)))
and |||φ, k))) we will deviate from the convention Eq. (8),
thus, e.g., |||N))) (cid:54)= ˆN .) From these we constructed the
k-oﬀdiagonal versions

|||N, k))) := |N (cid:105)(cid:104)N + k|,

Moreover, writing k = N (cid:48)−N in Eq. (19b) one recognizes
the eigenvalue N + 1
2 (N + N (cid:48)) as the classical sym-
metrized coordinate of the meter’s needle. This splitting
into the sum and diﬀerence of N and N (cid:48) is well-known
from the Moyal gradient expansion66 around the semi-
classical limit using Wigner67,68 or Green’s functions69.
The relevant phase superoperator Φ that is conjugate
to the charge anticommutator N ∝ ˆN •+• ˆN in the sense

[N , Φ] = i

is given by the commutator, the phase diﬀerence

Φ := ˆφ • − • ˆφ,

(20)

(21)

Thus, Φ is the momentum canonically conjugate to the
classical charge-meter needle position N : it implements

the unitary symmetry transformations (15a) on the me-
ter’s mixed state, i.e., the translations of the charge me-
ter’s needle. As we will see in Sec. V, the counting ﬁeld in
the density-operator FCS formalism is the eigenvalue φ
of this phase super operator Φ. It should not be confused
with the phase operator ˆφ in the initial Hamiltonian for-
mulation which is conjugate to the charge operator ˆN
[Eq. (5)]. (We note that from ˆN and ˆφ one can construct
another pair of conjugate superoperators for charge and
2 ( ˆφ • + • ˆφ). These do
phase: N (cid:48) = ˆN • − • ˆN and Φ(cid:48) = 1
not enter anywhere here: these are required only when
considering a phase meter –observable Φ(cid:48)– whose needle
is “kicked“ by symmetry generator N (cid:48) for charge.)

Diagonalization of the kernel in the meter space.
In
the following [Eq. (39)] we will need the diagonal form of
the kernel superoperator (9). This amounts to going to
the eigenbasis of the phase superoperator:

Eq. (9) we thus see that after integrating out the reser-
voirs, the ideal meter is coupled to the transported charge
through the meter’s needle momentum superoperator Φ.
Importantly, inserting Eq. (22) into the kernel (9) we see

Finally, we note that in the following we can drop all
k sums in the above expressions since we will restrict our
attention to physical meter states that are ˆN -diagonal8,
i.e., mixed states of the form (cid:80)

relate the charge ( ˆN ) and phase operators ( ˆφ) to the
relevant superoperators (N and Φ, respectively).

III. GEOMETRIC PHASES OF
ADIABATICALLY EVOLVING MIXED STATES

To keep the paper self-contained, this section collects
the key steps of the adiabatic state evolution (ASE) ap-
proach to slowly-driven open quantum systems guided
by our points of interest in Table I. This approach due
to Sarandy and Lidar20,21 –in principle not related to
transport– generalizes the adiabatic closed-system ap-
proach: starting from a time-local master equation of the
form (7) it leads to a Berry-Simon type geometric phase
for the mixed-state operator. In Sec. IV, we will apply
this approach to the pumping model which explicitly in-
cludes the meter. Here we ﬁrst discuss the less speciﬁc
problem of the driven state-evolution governed by Eq. (7)
[i.e., without assuming Eq. (25)].

Mixed states, modes and decay rates. First we con-
sider ﬁxed parameters R (not indicated), for which the
time-evolved state reads

|||ρ(t)))) = |||k0))) +

(cid:88)

m=1,2,...

ekmtcm(0) |||km))).

(26)

Here, the modes are the right eigenvectors which satisfy
K|||km))) = km|||km))). These are operators |||km))) = ˆkm la-
beled m = 1, 2, . . .. These nonstationary modes account

8 Acting on ˆN -diagonal meter states the k (cid:54)= 0 terms in the super-
operators give zero and can be dropped. They contain no terms
that couple the k = 0 and k (cid:54)= 0 components of the state since
the diﬀerence ˆN − ˆn between the meter and the left reservoir
charge is conserved by the construction (3). (This is no longer
true if superconducting electrodes are considered.)

for the dissipative decay65 since their eigenvalues have
Re km < 0. We label by m = 0 the zero-mode with eigen-
value k0 = 0, i.e., |||k0))) = ˆk0 is the stationary density op-
erator. We assume for simplicity that K has a completely
nondegenerate spectrum for all parameter values9, in par-
ticular, that the stationary state |||k0))) is unique. This ap-
plies to a very large class of practically relevant cases.
Because the evolution is non-Hamiltonian, K is not a
normal operator (K †K (cid:54)= KK †) and the left eigenvec-
tors (covectors) are not the hermitian adjoints of the
right ones and need to be determined separately65. For
each eigenvalue km the corresponding left supereigen-
vector (((¯km||| is thus speciﬁed by an operator ˆ¯km diﬀer-
ent from ˆkm, as indicated by the overbar. The covector
plays a diﬀerent role: given the initial state for Eq. (26),
|||ρ(0)))) = (cid:80)
m cm(0)|||km))), it determines the amplitude for
mode |||km))) being excited:

cm(0) = (((¯km|ρ(0)))) = Tr

(cid:16)ˆ¯k†

mρ(0)

(cid:17)

.

(27)

Furthermore, the zero mode |||k0))) always exists since the
trace-preservation TrK• ∝ (((¯k0|||K• = 0 requires that
there is a corresponding covector with ˆ¯k0 ∝ 1.

Adiabatic mixed-state and decoupling. When slowly
driving the parameters, it can be shown20,21,23 that in
the leading approximation the mixed state maintains the
form (26):

|||ρ(t)))) =

(cid:88)

m=0,1,...

ezm(t)cm(0) |||km[R(t)]))).

(28)

It is therefore meaningful to refer to the m = 0 (m (cid:54)= 0)
contributions as its parametrically (non)stationary com-
ponents. A key question addressed in this paper is to
physically understand how this adiabatic procedure man-
ages to (correctly) capture nonadiabatic eﬀects when ap-
plied to a suitably modiﬁed open system (including a me-

the modes |||km))) evolve independently since any crosstalk
is negligible due to the slow driving. Their coeﬃcients
have evolution phases zm(t) = zn,m(t) + zg,m(t) which
are no longer given by Eq. (26). After one period, at
t = T , the modes all return to their initial values10 since
the parameters have traversed a closed curve C in the pa-
rameter space, R(T ) = R(0). However, the state |||ρ(T ))))
has changed relative to |||ρ(0)))) due to all the geometric
and nongeometric phases, respectively,

one for each mode m contributing to the state (28).

Thus, the ASE approach formally resembles the Berry-
Simon approach to closed systems, except for distinguish-
ing left from right eigenvectors. In closed systems one is
essentially only concerned with the right eigenvectors of
the time-evolution because the closed system Hamilto-
nian H is hermitian (implying the left eigenvectors are
simply their adjoints). For such Hamiltonian dynamics,
we have K(t) = −i[H(t), •] and the master equation (7)
reduces to the usual Liouville-von Neumann equation.
One veriﬁes that in this case one exactly recovers the
standard closed-system approach for ket vectors includ-
ing Berry’s result for a spin in a rotating ﬁeld70.

Geometric phases and nonstationarity. However,
there is an important diﬀerence in the way physical re-
strictions enter for open systems. In particular, the ker-
nel needs to preserve the trace and hermiticity of the
density operator. This requires the adiabatically decou-
pled state to take the more speciﬁc form

eigenvalue km (k∗
In view of the following discus-
sion we assume that for m (cid:54)= 0 there all eigenvalues are
complex. This implies that steady-state geometric phases
arise only if the mixed state has a parametric nonstation-
ary component, similar to closed systems, see App. C. We
need to distinguish the two cases:

First, the parametrically stationary mode m = 0 in
Eq. (30) has a real eigenvalue, so its operator can be
chosen hermitian, ˆk0 = ˆk†
0. If we trace-normalize it to be
a physical state (stationary state), Trˆk0 = 1, then c0 = 1
is ﬁxed for all times as in Eq. (26). These physical re-
strictions force both the geometric and the non-geometric
phase for the zero mode to vanish: z0 = zn,0 = zg,0 = 0
since k0 = 0 in Eq. (29b) and (((¯k0|k0))) = (((1|k0))) = 1 in
Eq. (29a). That |||k0))) can be trace-normalized reﬂects
that it is the only term in the expansion on the right-
hand side of Eq. (28) that is a valid physical state [con-
sistent with |||ρ(t)))) → |||k0))) in the stationary limit for ﬁxed
parameters]. This should be contrasted with closed sys-
tems, where each term in a superposition of pure-state
vectors similar to Eq. (28) represents a physical state.
Since in the slowly driven steady-state limit the unique
zero-mode contribution dominates, the time-dependent
steady-state (28) exhibits no geometric phase as a result
of trace-normalization.

Second, the parametrically nonstationary modes m ≥
1 in Eq. (30) are pairs of non-hermitian operators with
complex-conjugate coeﬃcients (complex eigenvalue km).
The operators for these nonstationary components are
necessarily traceless, Trˆkm = Trˆk†
m = 0, and therefore
are not quantum states by themselves or in any com-
bination. They can only be added to the stationary
state as in Eq. (30) to form the physical state |||ρ))). This

Along this curve, the parallel transport condition (33) holds, or, equivalently, the curve minimizes the Fock condition (35).

represented by such a curves in its own space.

lack of trace-normalization also allows the nonstationary
modes |||km))) —and only these— to accumulate nonzero
(non)geometric phases (29).

We note that the positivity of the density operator ˆρ(t)
imposes a further nonlinear constraint on the evolution.
Whereas in closed systems this is automatically ensured,
in open systems this is not the case. This has received
little attention in the context of pumping and geometric
phases and we will return to it in Sec. IV [Eq. (61)].

Gauge freedom and physical restrictions. The appear-
ance of a geometric phase such as Eq. (29a) in general
requires some gauge freedom. Here, similar to closed
systems, the gauge freedom resides in the possibility of
choosing a diﬀerent normalization of the eigenvectors in
the expansion of the state while leaving the state invari-
ant: each pair of right and left eigenvectors can be mod-
iﬁed to gauged eigenvectors

(((¯km|||Gm = (Gm)−1(((¯km|||,

|||km)))Gm = Gm|||km))),

(31)

if the coeﬃcients are simultaneously adjusted to cm,Gm =
(Gm)−1cm [Eq. (27)]. A gauge for mode m is thus any
choice of a continuous nowhere-vanishing complex func-
tion of the parameters, Gm[R]. In contrast to closed sys-
tems, in open systems the physical requirements for the
gauges are less restrictive: Although preservation of the
form (30), written compactly as |||ρ))) = (cid:80)

m = G−m,

(32)

this still allows the modes |||km))) to accumulate a normal-
ization factor11 with real phases under non-unitary evo-
lution, in addition to the usual imaginary phase factors.

Parallel transport of nonstationary components. Fi-
nally, to see what is precisely geometric about the adi-
abatic evolution [Eqs. (28)-(29)] we can closely follow
the Berry-Simon approach to closed quantum systems.
In particular, in Eq. (28) the evolution factor ezg,m(T )
for each parametrically-nonstationary mode (m ≥ 1) is
equivalent to a geometric parallel transport in the space
of parameters (R) and nonzero complex gauge values
(Gm). This means for each m separately that if we
try to gauge away this evolution factor we will in gen-
eral fail as illustrated in Fig. 3. Suppose we look for
cm(t) such that |||k(cid:48)

in this new “rotating frame”. Eq. (33) is equivalent to

Am,cm

dt cm = 0,

(34)

where Am = (((¯km|∇Rkm))) is the connection appearing
in the result (29a). Solving this for cm(t) one obtains
(only) the nontrivial geometric evolution factor cm(T ) =
e− (cid:72)
C dRAm cm(0) = ezg,m(T )cm(0) in Eq. (28), explain-
ing12 its geometric origin. The geometric phase cannot
be gauged away: for a small driving curve C around a
point R with nonzero curvature Bm = ∇R × Am, the so-
lution cm(t) will be discontinuous and fails to be a valid
gauge. The phases zg,m are thus unavoidable and phys-
ically relevant. We stress that the adiabatic evolution
of a single mixed state involves the parallel transport of

tion between left- and right eigenvectors (((¯km|km))) = 1.

12 The left hand side of Eq. (34) is one of several ways of deﬁning
a geometric connection. The deﬁnition employed here leads to a
clear physical picture later on [Eqs. (63), (76), (87)].

ily of geometric pictures, each as in Fig. 3,is physically

consideration of the geometric phase of a single vector
suﬃces.

Discussion: diﬀerence with Uhlmann’s phase. This
completes our summary of the ASE approach as applied
for the following.
It is, however, relevant to point out
that the parallel transport condition (33) can be formu-
lated also as a Fock-type condition71:

((( d

for all possible curves cm parametrized by time. Here the
overbar in the covector indicates that the distance mea-
sure used depends on the particular nonhermitian evo-
lution kernel K in Eq. (7), see App. D for details. This
should be contrasted with parallel transport in closed
systems, where due to the hermicity of the Hamiltonian,
the Fock condition “(cid:104) d
dt ψ(cid:105) is stationary” involves the
standard hermitian metric, independent of the Hamilto-
nian. Thereby, Eq. (35) also diﬀers from the deﬁnition
of the Uhlmann geometric phase 18 for density operators
which is also deﬁned using the Fock condition for a closed
“puriﬁed” system13. This diﬀerence is relevant in view
of the recent interest9,15–17 in ﬁnding measurable quan-
tities that are related to the Uhlmann phase. The in-
verse route taken in the present paper –starting from
physical evolution and measurable quantities and then
identifying the relevant geometric structures– leads to a
diﬀerent type of geometric parallel transport condition,
one that depends on the particular open-system dynam-
ics from which it was derived. Of course, for topological
quantities the connection used to compute them does not
matter by the Chern-Weil theorem, but our discussion in-
dicates that considerations of measurements are tied to
diﬀerent types of connections.

IV. ADIABATIC STATE EVOLUTION OF
SYSTEM + METER

In the following we derive geometric pumping in terms
of the established geometric approach to adiabatic mixed
states [Sec. III] by exploiting the special structure (25)
of the evolution (7) of an open system extended by an
ideal meter [Sec. II]. We purposefully postpone compar-
ison with the FCS and AR approach to Secs. V and VI,
respectively, to systematically answer the questions that
they raised.

10

A. Adiabatic, nonstationary composite-state
evolution.

Since we integrate out only the reservoirs, while ex-
plicitly keeping the meter as part of the open system,
the master equation (7) treats the system-meter coupling
as instantaneous. As a result, the adiabatic evolution
of the mixed composite state correctly describes pump-
ing eﬀects. Thus, in this description there is no visible
“lag” between driven system and charge measurement, cf.
Secs.V-VI. The adiabatic solution of the master equation
(28) involves the decoupling of the kernel eigenmodes.
We start from Eq. (25)

K(t) =

(36)

and further diagonalize the kernel also in the system
space. The resulting eigenvectors inherit the special
tensor-product form of (25)

peroperator W φ in Eq. (36) whose eigenvalues coincide
with those of K(t), i.e., kl,φ(t) = wφ
l (t). Compared to
the previous section, the eigenmodes are thus labeled by
a composite mode index, m → (l, φ): a discrete system
index l = 0, 1, 2, . . . and the continuous meter momentum
φ ∈ [−π, π].

As a consequence of the ideal coupling, the meter
kets |||φ))) are time- and parameter independent. The
modes |||kl,φ))) with diﬀerent φ are thus already decou-
pled before the adiabatic approximation. Denoting the
meter density operator by ρM(0), we ﬁnd that start-
ing from any classical meter state, a statistical mixture
ρM(0) = (cid:80)

The tensor product expresses the absence of backaction

only involves the decoupling of the eigenmodes with the
same φ but diﬀerent l = 0, 1, . . .:

and we denote the remaining l = 0 coeﬃcient at t = T
by Z φ = ezφ
. We stress that this involves two steps:
to extract the steady-state component of ρ(t) one must
“reset” the initial condition of the system plus meter,
cφ
0 (0) = 1 for all φ. Importantly, before this resetting the
function cφ
0 (0) cannot be properly gauged away (i.e., in a
continuous fashion). We discuss this in detail in App. E
since this is easily overlooked22. After this resetting, we
are thus free to ﬁx a reference gauge for the eigenvectors
|||kl,φ(t)))) by requiring

(((1|wφ

0 (t)))) = 1 for all φ and t.

(41)

This gauge ensures that the meter readout statistics is en-
tirely contained in the coeﬃcient Z φ and no additional in-
formation remains in the eigenvector normalization: the
reduced density operator of the meter obtained by addi-
tionally tracing out the system is then

ρM := TrSρ =

2π Z φ|||φ))).

(42)

The quantum state Eq. (40) describes the system plus
meter in an ideal adiabatic steady-state pumping exper-
iment. The contributions to |||ρ))) from all the nonzero
meter momenta φ (cid:54)= 0 are parametrically-nonstationary
[Eq. (30) ﬀ.]: for ﬁxed parameters these terms account for
the fact that the charge meter keeps running, even when
(the current through) the system –without meter– has
become stationary. (This latter point is made explicit in
the AR approach discussed in Sec. VI, cf. Eq. (83).)

B. Continuum of Berry-Simon phases

and pumped charge.

As we have seen [Eq. (30) and App. C], parameter
driving in general leads to geometric phase accumulation
only in the parametrically nonstationary components of
the time-dependent state. Indeed, the coeﬃcients

Z φ = ezφ

,

zφ = zφ

n + zφ

(43)

esting eﬀects as noted only recently in related FCS studies72,73,
see also the discussion in Sec. VII. In our formulation crossings
lead to nonadiabatic evolution of system-plus meter (not to be
confused with nonadiabaticity of the system only, cf. Sec. VI.
15 In Eq. (39) only the l = 0 eigenspace contributes in the long time
limit. The l (cid:54)= 0 modes decay on the time scale Γ−1, see App.
D of Ref. 23.

is a “sum of snapshots” of the eigenvalues [Eq. (29b)].
The geometric part,

(45)

is determined by the eigenvectors through the geometric
connection of the Berry-Simon type [Eq. (29a)]
Aφ := (((¯k0,φ|∇R|k0,φ))) = ((( ¯wφ

0 |∇R|wφ
0 ))).

(46)

Since it relies on the eigenvectors, it arises even when the
eigenvalues wφ
0 in Eq. (44) were all zero along the path
C of accessed parameters, i.e., if there was no transport
at all (including no ﬂuctuations).
It thus accounts for
pumping contributions to the entire, slowly driven trans-
port process.

In our physical model (6), it is clear from the beginning
that the transport statistics of charge is exactly registered
by the meter incorporated in the quantum state ρ(T ) –
and thus in Z φ or zφ– because every passing electron
“kicks” the meter [Eq. (4) and (15b)]. More precisely,
the projective measurements of the reservoir charge at
two times – with outcomes n at t = 0 and n(cid:48) at t = T –
determine the statistics for the change of the reservoir
electron number through the 2-point moments M(k) of
order k = 1, 2, . . .:

M(k) :=

(cid:88)

n(cid:48)n

(n(cid:48) − n)kpn(cid:48)n.

(47)

Here pn(cid:48)n is the joint 2-point probability distribution for
this system-reservoir process. At this point it is conve-
nient to initialize the meter in the pure state with zero
average and no dispersion, |||0))) = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0|. Then, the 2-point
moments of charge transport appear as 1-point measure-
ments of powers of the charge ˆN indicated by the meter,
M(k) = (cid:104) ˆN k(cid:105)(T ),

(48)

which is veriﬁed in App. A. This is possible because the
meter only registers changes of the charge by its ideal
coupling to transport through the phase superoperator
Φ [Eq. (15b)]. Since we include the meter in the open
system, we simply compute these averages in the stan-
dard way from the meter reduced density operator:

M(k) = Tr
M

ˆN kρM(T ) = (−∂iφ)kZ φ(cid:12)

(cid:12)φ=0 .

(49)

Although the last formula is familiar from formal FCS
considerations to be discussed in Sec. V, here we can
physically understand all of its aspects as shown by the
steps of its derivation:

Tr

(50a)

(50b)

The ﬁrst equality (50a) was discussed in Eq. (18). The
second step highlights the physical meaning of the quan-
tity φ, the counting ﬁeld of the FCS approach discussed
in Sec. V: it is the momentum conjugate to the relevant
“classical” charge super operator N , the position of the
needle of the charge meter [Eq. (5) and (20) ﬀ.]:

N → ∂iφ when acting on |||φ))).

(51)

The phase should not be confused with the conjugate to
the quantum charge operator ˆN [Eq. (21) ﬀ.]. Third,
the phase derivative in (50b) is made to act on the
system factor Z φ |||wφ
0 (T )))) of the composite state |||ρ(T ))))
[Eq. (40)] by partial integration using the gauge condi-
tion (((1|wφ
0 (t)))) = 1 [Eq. (41)]. We see that the extra
sign in −∂iφ that appears in the formula (49) relative
to Eq. (51) simply reﬂects that the charge added to the
system is counted negative by the meter. Finally, this
derivative is taken only at φ = 0 due the partial trace
which traces out the meter:

TrMN |||φ))) = TrM∂iφ|||φ))) = ∂iφ2πδ(φ)

(52)

This shows that setting φ = 0 corresponds to discarding
information about further measurement outcomes on the
meter. Thus, the formal phase-derivative at zero phase in
Eq. (50b) emerges naturally from a measurement of the
charge observable on the meter, after which the meter is
discarded. Relations (48), (51) and (52) will also clarify
the structure of the AR equations in Sec. VI.

The formula (49) furthermore underlines that the
(non)geometric part of the transported charge (M(1)) is
never equal to a single (non)geometric phase of some
quantum state: Physically this is clear since an ideal
charge meter has an inﬁnite number of discrete needle
positions with necessarily a continuum of conjugate mo-
menta φ (kinematics). All these are required to describe
the charge detection process, resulting in a correspond-
ing continuum of (non)geometric phases (dynamics). A
particular measurement (cid:104) ˆN k(cid:105)(T ) = M(k) only accesses
a certain Taylor coeﬃcient [Eq. (49)] but not the entire
function Z φ which is essentially the state (40) or (42).16

C. Gauge transformations – meter recalibration

It remains to clarify why geometric quantities emerge
in the transport process as a whole by identifying the
physical origin of the gauge freedom.
(In the general
ASE approach of Sec. III the freedom to re-normalize
eigenvectors was merely formal.) This origin is simply the
possibility of calibrating the meter and geometric parallel

16 Note carefully:

in Sec. VI the pumped charge is nevertheless
expressed directly as single geometric (Landsberg) phase but this
is not a (Berry-Simon) phase of a state, but a (Landsberg) phase
of the observable.

12

transport is the (failed) attempt to calibrate away any
eﬀect of the transport process. To develop both ideas we
need to take a few steps.

First, the gauge freedom (31) in the present problem
translates to multiplying the system and meter tensor-
factor in Eq. (38) by opposite gauge functions such that
the state |||ρ))) remains invariant:

|||ρφ))) → |||ρφ)))G := (Gφ)−1|||ρφ)))
|||φ))) → |||φ)))G := Gφ |||φ))).

(53a)

(53b)

Because there is a continuum of modes, the gauge Gφ
is a function of the meter-momentum φ. As function
of time it is convenient and without loss of generality
to ﬁx the initial condition to Gφ[R(0)] = 1 for all φ.
Preservation of the trace and hermiticity of the composite
state ρ require that we maintain [Eq. (32)]

G0 = 1,

(Gφ)∗ = G−φ.

(54)

Analogous to other problems with a gauge structure, the
gauge freedom can be exploited as follows: A transfor-
mation (53b) to an arbitrary gauge Gφ [relative to the
reference (41)] amounts to writing

|||ρ))) =

(cid:90) π

−π

dφ

2π Sφ|||wφ

0 ))) ⊗

(cid:104)
Gφ|||φ)))

(cid:105)
.

(55)

and correspondingly for the meter density operator (42)

(cid:90)

ρM =

dφ

2π Sφ |||φ)))G.

(56)

with new coeﬃcients Sφ = Z φ(Gφ)−1. Expectation val-
ues on the meter are gauge-invariant:

M(k) = Tr
M

ˆN kρM(T ) = (−∂iφ)kSφGφ(cid:12)

(cid:12)φ=0 .

(57)

One thus splits up the problem of computing the Z φ =
GφSφ in Eq. (49) by decomposing it into a simple or con-
venient gauge function Gφ (absorbed into the meter ket)
and an unknown complicated part Sφ, the solution to be
computed in this gauge. For example, by a choice of Gφ
one can eliminate26 the parametrically time-dependent
capacitive screening charges from the calculation of the
pumped charge (ﬁrst moment).

Next, we note that gauge transformations can only be

combined with the geometric factor of the solution

Z φ = Z φ

g Z φ
n ,

(58)

g = ezφ

(The nongeometric factor Z φ

which is a functional Z φ

ally has a functional dependence on the velocities ˙R(t).)
Thus, when working in some gauge one rather considers
the split

n = ezφ

Z φ

g = GφSφ.

(59)

rather than splitting up Z φ.

Finally, to clearly see how physical restrictions aﬀect
gauge transformations we need to consider the charge
representation (in contrast to geometric considerations
which are most evident in the phase representation). The
special form of the composite state (38) implies

|||ρ))) =

(cid:90) π

−π

dφ

2π |||ρφ))) ⊗ |||φ))) =

(cid:88)

N

|||ρ−N))) ⊗ |||N))).

(60)

This reﬂects that by our construction (3) of the ideal
meter model the classical information about the charge
exchanged between system and reservoir (−N , i.e., lost
by system) is “copied” to the ideal meter (N ) without any
backaction. The charge representation in Eq. (60) shows
that the gauge transformation (53b) leading to Eq. (55)
corresponds to changing the pure meter states to

(61)

N GN = 1 and GN ∈ R.

These are physical mixed states provided GN ≥ 0 for
all N in addition to the restrictions (32) which translate
to (cid:80)
In this case, the gauge
transformation in the charge representation GN −N (cid:48)
is the
classical probability of randomly ﬁnding the pure state
|N (cid:48)(cid:105)(cid:104)N (cid:48)| when the meter is in the gauged state |||N)))G. We
have thus found that working in such a physical gauge,
part of the transport statistics has been absorbed into
parametrically evolving mixed meter states |||N)))G that
are used to count charge: the meter has been recalibrated
by making the meter states “noisy” with a probability
distribution GN −N (cid:48)
(assumed to be known). This is what
the formal freedom of re-normalizing eigen-supervectors
of the evolution superoperator K [Eq. (53)] physically
amounts to for an ideal pumping process.

D. Bochner’s constraints of positivity.

Before we can develop a physical picture of geometric
parallel transport, we need to discuss whether a gauge
GN always has (and should have) positive values and
thus make sense as probabilities56. Although for closed
systems this is always true, for open systems negative
values are unavoidable, but, on the other hand, never
lead to incorrect results.

N Z −N |N (cid:105)(cid:104)N |, is a valid quantum state.

We ﬁrst note that in any case Z N must be positive
because the reduced density operator of the meter (42),
ρM = (cid:80)
In
the following we simply call Gφ “positive” if it Fourier
transforms to a positive distribution GN . Importantly,
this property can be checked with Bochner’s criterion55
directly on Gφ without actually performing the Fourier
transform, as discussed in App. F. This criterion makes
explicit that in the original φ-representation there is a
serious constraint on the class of allowed gauge functions

Gφ if they are to have physical meaning as the Fourier
transform of the statistical mixing coeﬃcients of meter
states [Eq. (61)].

13

GN (cid:48)

N (cid:48) SN −N (cid:48)

Performing gauge transformations in an open system
is thus not an innocent procedure as it is in closed
quantum system:
in general, two probability distribu-
tions Z N and GN cannot be related by a convolution
Z N = (cid:80)
with a third function SN that is
also a probability distribution. Although the function Sφ
in Eq. (56) can be found, given a positive Gφ, Bochner’s
criterion imposes nontrivial constraints on Sφ to be pos-
itive as well. We stress, that the correctness of the ﬁ-
nal result Z φ to be computed is never at stake. This
should be contrasted with closed systems where physical
restrictions and geometric considerations can be cleanly
separated. To develop some intuition how such negative
values arise we consider some simple examples in Fig. 4.
In Fig. 4(a) three possible scenarios are sketched when
assuming for simplicity that the geometric factor domi-
nates, Z φ ≈ Z φ
g , and thus is positive. This ﬁgure shows
that a positive function can be split into two positive
functions, a positive and a negative one, or even into two
In these scenarios, the correct physical,
negative ones.
positive Z φ
g is obtained even though either the chosen
gauge (Gφ) or the computed solution (Sφ) or both may
be nonpositive and lack a classical probabilistic interpre-
tation. The ﬁnal answer is obtained by Eq. (59) corre-
GN (cid:48)
sponding to a charge-convolution Z N
.
In Fig. 4(b) we show additional scenarios that arise in
the case where Z φ
g does not dominate, i.e., the coeﬃcient
g Z φ
Z φ = Z φ
n consists of both a nontrivial geometric factor
Z φ
n . Since it is only required
by Eq. (58) that the convolution Z N = (cid:80)
Z N (cid:48)
g
is positive, there seems to be no reason that the individ-
ual functions Z N
g must be positive. Therefore
scenarios arise where Zg is negative and can be split into
a negative and a positive or even two negative functions.
This means that geometric and nongeometric contribu-
tions generally do not correspond to well-deﬁned clas-
sical processes, i.e., with probability distributions. For
example, if nongeometric and pumping eﬀects compete,
it should be possible that their contributions partially
cancel (e.g., a reduction of noise due to pumping), which
requires a nonpositive Z φ
g as we illustrated in Fig. 4(b).
Thus, generally, considerations of the geometry / gauge
structure and of the probabilistic structure of open quan-
tum systems are nontrivially intertwined. However, in no
case one makes a mistake by applying gauge transforma-
tion: one is only working in an intermediate picture in
which the gauge and/or the solution computed in that
gauge may have no physical signiﬁcance.

This failure to ﬁnd a proper gauge (continuous) means
that the entire quantum state –system plus meter– ex-
hibits a geometric eﬀect: not just the average charge, but
the entire transport process (all ﬂuctuations).

Whenever Z φ

g is positive, the geometric parallel trans-
port thus has the physical meaning of a meter recalibra-
tion to proper physical mixed states [Eq. (61)]

This holds for the ideal case of “pure pumping” where
Z φ
g dominates Z φ and both are necessarily positive. In
this case, the information about the entire transport pro-
cess can be completely incorporated in a recalibration
of the meter, which does not evolve anymore (“rotating
frame”). Parallel transport (63) is thus the (impossible)
attempt to literally calibrate away the pumping eﬀect on
all charge transport quantities (current, noise, etc.) in
continuous fashion by an adjustment of the ideal meter.
One should, however, keep in mind [Sec. IV D] that
the splitting Z φ = Z φ
n does not in general guaran-
tee that Zg is positive, i.e., pumping is not a separate
process. With this provision, the above arguments can
be reversed: because an ideal meter can be literally re-
calibrated down to the level of its classical ﬂuctuations,
slowly driven transport measurements should in general
pick up geometric contributions in all moments of the
measurement statistics. One overlooks this simple phys-
ical origin of geometric eﬀects if one assumes that the
states Eq. (2) in the ideal meter are pure, as we did ini-
tially [Eq. (2) ﬀ.] following Schaller et. al57. Instead, one
should in general allow for measurements with “noisy”
meter states with known gauged statistics GN (i.e., which
are part of the meter design).

The equivalence of “trivial charge transport” meter-
calibration and geometric parallel transport was demon-
strated for the average pumped in Ref. 23. Here we have
generalized this natural physical idea to the entire trans-
port process (all moments) [cf. also Sec. V and Sec. VI]
noting the nontrivial intertwining with the physical con-
straint of positivity.
In Sec. VI we will show that this
complication goes unnoticed when one considers only the
ﬁrst moment (= ﬁrst cumulant) of pumping as in most
studies of pumping. Only in that case one can always
consider a given gauge transformation of the average
charge as realized by some meter-state calibration.

15

nonzero meter-momentum (φ (cid:54)= 0) which account for the
nonstationarity of the charge meter (“the meter keeps
running”). There is necessarily a continuum of geomet-
ric phases, one for each value of the momentum of the
meter’s needle. The gauge freedom underlying these ge-
ometric phases emerges from the simple physical freedom
to recalibrate the meter which includes making the me-
ter “noisy” in a known way. However, the requirement
of positivity nontrivially constrains the physical mean-
ing of geometric quantities in open quantum systems, in
strong contrast to closed quantum systems: only a sub-
set of gauge transformations correspond to a probability
distribution in the charge representation. Nevertheless,
we showed that the Berry-Simon type parallel transport
condition of adiabatic open-system time evolution can
be understood as trying to maintaining a “trivial charge
transport process” on the meter.

V. FULL COUNTING STATISTICS (FCS)

OF ADIABATIC PUMPING

Having discussed our comprehensive approach [Sec. IV]
in terms of mixed quantum-state evolution, we show in
the remainder of the paper how two prominent density-
operator approaches to pumping, FCS22,28,45,46,49,50 and
AR25,26,31–38, can be elegantly derived from it, thereby
reconciling their seemingly conﬂicting features in Table I.
In the present section, we ﬁrst discuss the FCS ap-
proach which is most closely related to the ASE approach
for an open system with meter inside, as illustrated in
Fig. 1(b). The expressions derived in the main part of
this paper [Sec. IV] were written such that one obtains
the FCS approach by simply dropping the meter ket |||φ)))
as we now show. Importantly, this does not mean that
the meter is physically discarded or eliminated – as in the
case of the AR approach discussed in the next Sec. VI.

State evolution, generating operator and counting ﬁeld.
In order to compute the statistics of charge transfer to
the reservoir, the FCS approach in its usual formula-
tion introduces a generating operator ρφ which is de-
ﬁned only on the system48. This auxiliary object is con-
structed such that the generating function Z φ = TrSρφ
produces the desired kth moment and cumulant, respec-
tively, through17

F. Summary

In this main section of this paper we have shown that
charge pumping results from the continuum of geomet-
ric phases accumulated in the adiabatic dynamics of the
composite system-plus-meter state. In particular, these
phases are picked up by the components of the state with

17 Our sign convention is opposite to the usual one in FCS but
is physically motivated.
It is ﬁxed by letting the ideal meter
indicate the same charge as counted in reservoir, outside the
system, and by deﬁning φ to be the momentum conjugate to the
meter-needle position, see Sec. II. This moreover ensures that
there are no signs in the phase representation |||ρ))) = (cid:82) dφ

Here, no reference is made to a composite system-meter
state as in Sec. IV, the meter momentum φ is treated as
an auxiliary “counting ﬁeld” variable: taking derivatives
and setting φ = 0 is just a way of generating the desired
expressions for the moments / cumulants (66) based on
measurements in the reservoir (see Eq. (A2)-(A3)).

Derivation of FCS equations from ASE. The FCS ap-
proach thus eﬀectively accounts for the measurements
performed outside the system through the φ dependence
of the quantity ρφ deﬁned only on the system. In con-
trast, in our ASE approach to pumping Eq. (66) arises
naturally from the ideal meter inside the open system in
line with the original motivation of the FCS by a meter
model64, see our discussion of Eq. (49). There we iden-
tiﬁed the meter phase φ as the meter-momentum [eigen-
value of the superoperator Φ, Eq. (21)] that is conju-
gate to the classical charge [superoperator N , Eq. (19b)].
Phase derivatives ∂iφ relate to meter-charge measure-
ments and setting φ = 0 discards the meter afterwards.
Finally, in our approach the generating function Z φ =
ezφ
naturally appeared when expanding the mixed meter
state (after integrating out both system and reservoirs)
in the meter-momentum basis |||φ))).

The central equation of the FCS approach describing
the evolution of ρφ is derived quite simply from the adi-
abatic state evolution of the system-meter model [(7),
(25b)] by formally leaving out all reference to the meter
space in Eq. (40) and treating φ as a parameter

d

dt|||ρφ))) = W φ|||ρφ))).

(68)

This follows ultimately from the ideality of the meter
model [tensor product structure in Eq. (36) and (38)],
not by discarding the meter (which we do not). We
stress that after leaving out (cid:82) dφ/(2π) . . . |||φ))) the remain-
ing quantity ρφ by itself is not a state of some system,
even though Eq. (68) formally resembles the evolution of
a quantum state. First, it is not the state of the system,
the reduced density operator ρS, even though it includes
that state.18 This diﬀerence between ρφ and ρS is crucial
since physical restrictions (normalization, hermiticity) do
not quench43 the gauge freedom for ρφ as they do for ρS
[Sec. VI], allowing ρφ to accumulate a nonzero geometric
phase for φ (cid:54)= 0. Second, |||ρφ))) is also not the state of the
system plus meter: only the full system-meter expression
Eq. (38) has this direct physical meaning.

18 If one does integrate out the meter [Sec. VI] we indeed have
dt |||ρS))) = W |||ρS))) with W :=

ρφ|φ=0 = ρS and from Eq. (68) d
W φ|φ=0.

Nonstationary FCS and Berry-Simon phase. For
slowly driven parameters, the ASE and FCS approach
account for pumping of transport quantities in the same
way by performing an adiabatic decoupling approxima-
tion. Taking account of the steady-state limit as ex-
plained in Sec. IV, in particular, “resetting” cφ
0 = 1, and
deﬁning the gauge by (((1|wφ
0 ))) = 1 [Eq. (39) ﬀ.] leads to

(69)

Apart from parametrically following of the eigenvector
|||wφ

Z φ = ezφ
. In our approach this parametric nonstationar-
ity19 is seen to correspond to the meter needle “running”
(net current) and ﬂuctuating (higher cumulants). The
geometric part of the exponent zφ, the second term in

is of the Berry-Simon type due to the formal similarity
of Eq. (68) to the closed-system Hamiltonian evolution
[Sec. III]. Because in our approach we keep |||φ))), we see
that this phase appears in the nonstationary component
of the physical state of system plus meter, which is always
the case [Sec. III, Eqs. (30), (42) and App. C]. Thus, even
though ρφ itself is not a state, its geometric phase is an
adiabatic Berry-Simon phase (45) of a mixed state.

Gauge freedom. As discussed in Sec. IV C, in our ASE

approach, the gauge transformations

can be naturally regarded as changes of the meter factor
|||φ))) in the system-meter state: gauge freedom is thus a
consequence of physical recalibration of the meter. If one
instead sticks to the FCS equation (68) in which all ref-
erence to the meter space remains implicit, gauge trans-
formations are not easily related to meter recalibration.
Instead of (53), gauge transformations are then equiva-
lently introduced as a simultaneous rescaling of the eigen-
vectors and of the generating function

such that the generating operator |||ρφ))) in Eq. (69) stays
invariant. As in Sec. IV, Sφ denotes the solution sought
working in the gauge Gφ. This absorption of a factor of
the generating function into the eigenvector suggests no
relation to physical meter calibrations.

Geometric parallel transport = “trivial charge trans-
port”.
In the FCS approach the parallel transport con-
dition (63) of the system-plus-meter state, a condition
holding for all values of φ, can be expressed in terms of
geometric parts20 of the cumulants. To see this, consider
the adiabatic evolution equation of the cumulant gener-
ating function that leads to Eq. (70a),

d

dt zφ

G = wφ

0 − Aφ ˙R − d

(73)

in an arbitrary gauge Gφ = egφ
this determines the kth cumulant current

[Eq. (71)]. By Eq. (66)

d

G = w(k)

0 − A(k) ˙R − d

(74)

where, similar to the real-valued cumulants C(k) (67), the
terms on the right hand side of Eq. (73) have been ex-
panded in powers of φ,

Geometric parallel transport (63) of the system-meter

(77)

Geometrically, Eq. (76) deﬁnes a horizontal lift curve in
the space of parameters R × cumulant gauges g(k). How-
ever, one should note that by our discussion in Sec. IV D,
maintaining a “trivial transport process” is physically
realizable as a recalibration of the meter state only if
the geometric factor of Z φ has a positive inverse Fourier
transform (guaranteed by Bochner’s criterion).

Adiabatic decoupling produces nonadiabatic current?
Equation (76) generalizes the parallel transport condi-
tion derived in Ref. 23 for the ﬁrst cumulant / moment
(k = 1) to arbitrary cumulants (k ≥ 2). However, in
Ref. 23 the considerations were based on the explicitly
nonadiabatic AR approach. In contrast, the FCS/ ASE
result (76) was derived using the adiabatic decoupling
procedure (69). In this last subsection we address this
apparent conﬂict from the FCS side by borrowing a few
simple considerations from the AR approach that are fur-
ther discussed in the next section.

17

C dRAφ = − (cid:82) T

The geometric phase in Eq. (70b) is generated by
a driving-velocity dependent argument in the contribu-
tion − (cid:72)
0 dt ˙RAφ which is well-known
from analogous closed-system state-evolution expres-
sions. However, one may equally well consider the ˙R-
dependence in this expression to indicate a nonadiabatic
eﬀect as one ﬁnds in response calculations39,40,74. This
point naturally arises when one inquires into the cur-
rents deﬁned by Eq. (73) that ﬂow through the system-
reservoir boundary, e.g., in the gauge Gφ = 1, gφ = 0:

I (k)
C

:= d

dt C(k) = w(k)

0 − A(k) d

dt R.

(78)

We now compare this with the form one would expect
in a response calculation, i.e., the expansion of the exact
cumulant currents (with a functional dependence on the
driving) to linear order in the driving velocity: I (k)
C ≈
I (k)
C [R] + δI (k)
C (R, ˙R) + . . . We see that the adiabatic cu-
mulant currents are just the real-valued coeﬃcients of the
parametric eigenvalue [Eq. (75)] I (k)
0 [R]. The
geometric cumulant current δI (k)
C (R, ˙R) = −A(k)[R] ˙R
is linear in the driving velocity ˙R and therefore gener-
ates the pumping contribution to the cumulant C(k) =
(cid:82) T
I (k)
C dt. The real-valued geometric connection A(k) has
0
the direct physical meaning of an adiabatic-response co-
eﬃcient:

C [R] = w(k)

−A(k)[R] =

δI (k)
C
δ ˙R

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12) ˙R=0

.

(79)

This is the ﬁrst nonadiabatic correction to the adiabatic
cumulant current. The parallel transport (76) is thus
equivalent to (trying to ﬁnd) gauges g(k) that maintain
zero nonadiabatic cumulant current δI (k)
G =
δI (k)
dt g(k) for all k = 0, 1, 2, . . .:

C,G := d

(80)

Thus, once one turns to a response formulation, geometry
and nonadiabaticity are seen to be closely linked in open
systems, even “from within” the FCS/ ASE approach
based on adiabatic decoupling.

The nonadiabaticity responsible for δI (k)

is due to the
ﬁnite “time-lag” between system and measurement of the
charge outside the system [see Sec. I and Sec. VI]. This
is conﬁrmed already by considering the simplest case of
the ﬁrst moment / cumulant k = 1 for which Eq. (74)
with G(1) = 1 gives

C

C(1) = (cid:104) ˆN (T )(cid:105) − (cid:104) ˆN (0)(cid:105)

Sec. IV D.

When one actually evaluates the expressions for A(1) =
−∂iφAφ|φ=0 within the AR approach, i.e., by really inte-
grating out the meter as discussed in Sec. VI, one ﬁnds

the result explicitly contains a ﬁnite “lag” time and thus
cannot be an adiabatic quantity as seen by the system
only. This second geometric part (81) was plotted for
our example system in Fig. 2.

One can thus equally well trace the physical origin of
the ˙R-dependence that turns − (cid:72)
C dRAφ into a geomet-
ric curve integral to the “lag” or retardation between
the system and the measured observable.
In the ASE
and FCS approach this explicit expression of the “lag” is
never manifest since it accounts for a meter that is ”run-
ning” inside the open system. The lag is correctly kept
track of but in a fragmented and implicit way.21

Summary.

In open quantum systems there is an ad-
ditional caveat in the term “adiabatic”:
the confu-
sion whether the ˙R-dependence indicates adiabaticity or
nonadiabaticity is not 22 a matter of deﬁning “adiabatic”
diﬀerently (i.e., which energy scales bound the driving
frequency). Although in all discussed approaches (ASE,
FCS, AR) it is required23 that ˙R (cid:28) Γ and the same re-
sults are obtained22,23, the FCS is adiabatic relative to
the system including the meter, whereas the AR is nona-
diabatic relative to the system without the meter. It is re-
vealing that the analogy to closed systems –characteristic
of the FCS/ ASE approach– breaks down precisely when
one inquires in the spirit of the AR approach into quan-
tities [Eq. (80)] characteristic of an open system (cur-
rents). Table I outlines how the question of adiabatic-
ity is closely tied to many other diﬃculties that depend
on whether the system boundary includes / excludes the
meter. That this is not merely a formal choice becomes
even more evident in the next section, where we explic-
itly place the meter outside the system, changing all the
features listed in Table I.

VI. NONADIABATIC PUMPING CURRENT:
AR APPROACH

Finally, we show how the AR approach can be derived
from the adiabatically evolving state of system plus me-
ter [Sec. IV], thereby clarifying the remaining unsettled
questions raised in the introduction. The AR approach

21 The “lag” eﬀect is distributed over various pieces that only
come together in the ﬁnal step of the calculation. This is al-
ready the case for the pumping current (k = 1) as explicitly
worked out in Sec. V C.4 of Ref. 23. More generally, to com-
pute A(k) = −∂k
0 ))) [Eq. (70b)]
requires contributions from both ((( ¯wφ
0 ))) to all lower or-
ders l = 0, . . . , k in φ.

22 In Ref. 23 we checked that ASE and AR approach when applied
to the steady state of the system only, are fully consistent: what
is (non)adiabatic in one approach, is thus also (non)adiabatic in
the other. In particular, the pumping curent is nonadiabatic in
both the ASE and AR approach applied to the system only. Note
carefully:
in Sec. IV and eﬀectively also Sec. V we applies the
ASE approach to the system-plus-meter, shifting the boundary
of the open system to include the meter.

is obtained from the ASE approach by physically discard-
ing the meter (measurement outcomes). Similar to the
FCS approach, the AR approach thus eliminates |||φ))) from
the equations in Sec. IV, but this time one additionally
sets φ = 0, which corresponds to tracing out the meter
[Sec. IV B]. This leads to a very diﬀerent physical and
geometric picture.

Derivation of AR equations from ASE. To achieve
a description referring only to the system, both for the
state and for measurements done outside the system, we
need to trace out the meter relative to Sec. IV. We ﬁrst
do this for the state ρ(t): tracing over the master equa-
tion (7), accounting for Eq. (36) and (38), gives a master
equation for the reduced state ρS(t) = TrMρ(t):

d

dt|||ρS))) = Tr

M

d

dt|||ρ))) = W φ(cid:12)

(cid:12)φ=0 |||ρS))) = W|||ρS))).

(82a)

Here the key step is to use TrM|||φ))) = 2πδ(φ), i.e., setting
φ = 0 integrates out the meter [cf. Eq. (52)]. Preserva-
tion of hermiticity and normalization for the composite
system implies that these are also preserved by the mas-
ter equation (82a). As we discussed in Sec. III, these
properties restrict the Berry-Simon geometric phase of
ρS to be zero in the driven steady state23. Thus, once
we physically discard the meter (by setting φ = 0) the
geometric phase of the system state is lost.

To recover the pumping eﬀect as a geometric phase
we need to consider the transport of an observable out-
side the system, i.e., keep track of additional information
about the reservoirs. Using the reduced state ρS we can-
not describe measurements of the charge ˆN registered by
the meter. This is reﬂected by the system kernel W being
the φ = 0 component [cf. Eq. (52)] of system-meter ker-
nel K [Eq. (36)], the sum over all possible charge trans-
fers:

W := W φ|φ=0 =

(cid:88)

W N .

(82b)

To recover the charge as computed in the AR approach
we need to consider the transport current into the reser-
voir as registered by the meter in the ASE approach,

IN := d
[Eq. (18)]. Using Eq. (52), i.e., tracing out the meter
after the measurement, we obtain

The second term vanishes by the trace preservation of

(cid:12)φ=0 = 0.
Thus, by integrating out the meter from our ASE ap-

proach we obtained23 the coupled set of AR equations
(82), in which the observable current is “enslaved” to the
driven state25,26,31–38. The current-kernel

WIN := −∂iφW φ|φ=0

(82f)

accounts for the additional system-reservoir correlations
that are needed to compute the current of charge mea-
sured outside the system. We point out the diﬀerence
dt (cid:104) ˆN (cid:105), namely the average veloc-
between the current d
ity of the needle of the charge-meter, and the needle’s
canonical momentum φ. Our result (82e)-(82f) relates
∂φ(((1|||iW φ|||ρS)))|φ=0, which interestingly
these as d
resembles a classical Hamilton equation for the velocity
d
dt x = ∂
∂p H, while the phase φ plays the role of momen-
tum and the meter is again discarded after the measure-
ment by setting φ = 0 [Eq. (52)].

dt (cid:104) ˆN (cid:105) = ∂

Nonadiabatic, driven stationary state. We now fol-
low the AR approach and compute the current coupled
to the state evolution by Eq. (82). Notably, to obtain
any pumping contribution at all for the ﬁrst moment
M(1) = (cid:104)N (cid:105)(T ) − (cid:104)N (cid:105)(0) we need to treat the parameter
driving in equations Eq. (82) in a way that diﬀers from
both the ASE / FCS approach. By putting the meter
outside the system in the AR approach we have to deal
with the ﬁnite physical “lag” between system and meter:
we need a nonadiabatic approximation relative to the adi-
abatic system state which obeys the instantaneous equa-
tion (“i”) W [R] |||ρi[R]))) = 0. In the notation of Sec. IV-V
this is the parametric stationary state, |||ρi))) = |||w0))). The
required nonadiabatic correction or response |||ρS,r))) (“r”)

|||ρS))) ≈ |||ρS,i))) + |||ρS,r))),

(83a)

is easily found to depend on R and linearly on ˙R:

|||ρS,r))) ≈

1
W

˙R ∇R|||ρS,i))).

(83b)

Since we have discarded the meter the steady system
state ρS(t) given by Eq. (83a) does not exhibit a geomet-
ric phase, even though it includes nonadiabatic eﬀects24.
This closely correlates with the fact that for ﬁxed pa-
rameters the system (without the running meter) has a
well-deﬁned stationary state.
In contrast, the system-
meter state ρ(t) in the ASE approach does have such
nonstationary components with geometric phases. Our
analysis shows that this opposite state of aﬀairs [Table I]

19

is a consequence only25 of having shifted the boundary
deﬁning the open system to exclude the meter [φ = 0]
as in Fig. 1. This is a characteristic of geometric eﬀects
in open systems: shifting the boundary can drastically
change both the physical and the geometric description
without changing any prediction for measurements.

Landsberg’s geometric phase and transported charge.
The AR equations (82a)-(82f) by their “enslaved” struc-
ture generate a dissipative geometric phase which was
considered in particular by Landsberg39–42, cf.
also
Ref. 43. The splitting (83a) of the geometrically triv-
ial state translates into a nongeometric and geometric
contribution to the transported charge

M(1) = (cid:104) ˆN (T )(cid:105) − (cid:104) ˆN (0)(cid:105)

The adiabatic part |||ρS,i))) leads to the nongeometric adi-
abatic current IN [R] = (((1|||WIN |||ρS,i))) that survives even
at zero driving velocity ( ˙R = 0). The nonadiabatic re-
sponse correction |||ρS,r))) gives rise to a nonadiabatic cur-
rent δIN (R, ˙R) = (((1|||WIN |||ρS,r))) that naturally deﬁnes a

(85)

Physically, this Landsberg connection23 is just the lead-
ing current-response to the driving velocity, a nonadia-
batic quantity: it depends on the inverse relaxation kernel
W −1, i.e., a ﬁnite “lag” or retardation [Eq. (83b)]. The
pumped charge contribution is equal to the single geo-
metric phase (cid:72)
C dRA of Landsberg, in contrast to the
ASE and FCS approach where exactly the same result is
obtained from an adiabatic approximation and a contin-
uum of Berry-Simon phases. In Ref. 22,23 it was tech-
nically veriﬁed that Eq. (81) and (84) are equivalent26:
A = −A(1) = ∂iφAφ|φ=0 and I i
0 |φ=0. Here,
however, we have physically related these two very diﬀer-
ent phases: the Landsberg pumping phase appears when
one traces out an ideal meter from a composite system
that accumulates Berry-Simon phases. Notably, it does
not appear by simply taking the partial trace of the state,
but additionally requires the partial trace of a transport
equation [Eq. (82e)]. Moreover, in the previous section

N = −∂iφwφ

23 Usually, these equations –including the explicit expressions for
the kernels W and WIN – are derived more economically25 with-
out any reference to FCS, counting ﬁelds or the meter model,
making it a very practical approach.

24 Although |||ρS,i))), and the nonadiabatic correction |||ρS,r))) can both
acquire geometric phases, these phases were shown to be zero due
to trace preservation in Ref. 23 [App. G and H], see also Sec. III:
the steady state |||ρS(t)))) of the system only is geometrically trivial.

25 In our ASE approach we do not put in / leave out anything by
hand relative to the FCS and AR approach, as explicitly veri-
ﬁed in Refs. 22,23. See App. E regarding a superﬂuous term in
Ref. 22.

26 The opposite signs are in a way unavoidable because in the ASE
and FCS approach leading to A(1) the natural convention is to
require the expression for the connection [Eq. (70b)] to resem-
ble that of Berry [Sec. III]. Landsberg’s connection A, however,
is naturally equated [Eq. (85)] to the physical pumping eﬀect
without a sign.

[Eq. (78)] we indicated that higher FCS cumulants C(k)
similarly can be understood as nonadiabatic Landsberg
phases.

Practically, the Landsberg curvature B = ∇R × A ob-
tained from Eq. (85) simpliﬁes calculations23,26,33 and it
directly corresponds to the physical pumped charge per
unit area in driving-parameter space. Our illustration in
Fig. 2 of the charge pumping eﬀect for our example quan-
tum dot of Sec. II was computed this way23, coinciding
with the FCS expressions.

Gauge transformations – geometric phase accumulated
by observable? In the AR approach, the gauge freedom
that allows the Landsberg geometric phase to accumulate
lies in the possibility of recalibrating the meter observ-
able23,43 as ˆN → ˆN + g1 [Eq. (1)]. Our considerations
in Sec. IV readily reveal this freedom: the gauge trans-
formation (61) of the meter states |||N))) → |||N)))G deﬁnes a
new gauged meter observable operator27:

(cid:88)

ˆN =

N|||N))) → ˆNG =

N

(cid:88)

N

N|||N)))G = ˆN + g1,

(86)

where g = (cid:80)
N N GN = −∂iφGφ|φ=0 = −∂iφgφ|φ=0 =
g(1) is the real linear coeﬃcient in Gφ or gφ [Eq. (71)].
This provides a direct physical understanding how this
gauge freedom in the observable –uncommon in quantum
physics– emerges from the gauge freedom in the system-
meter state in the familiar Berry-Simon setting. In the
usual formulation of the AR approach25 this requires es-
tablishing the gauge covariance of the AR equations (82)
through a careful derivation of the current kernel 23.

Another insight going beyond Ref. 23 is that for the
ﬁrst moment M(1) the gauge transformation of the ob-
servable can always be understood physically as arising
from some recalibration of the meter states (mixed in-
stead of pure ones), rather than recalibrating the meter
observable (86).
In App. G we show that the positiv-
ity restriction discussed in Sec. IV D does not prohibit
the construction of a meter-state gauges corresponding
to any given real value of g. Since for pumping of the
ﬁrst moment, the gauge freedom is exhausted by the ob-
servable recalibration (86), this implies that Bochner’s
positivity criterion Sec. IV D imposes no constraint on
pumping of the average charge unlike the situation for
higher moments.

Parallel transport = zero nonadiabatic current. Fi-
nally, by discarding the meter, the “trivial charge-

entire transport process), see Eq. (76) for k = 1. The
condition (87) was related in Ref. 23 to attempting to
gauge away [by the recalibration (86)] the nonadiabatic
pumping current (as seen by the system), i.e., Lands-
berg’s connection equals the pumping current.

Summary. Our approach developed in Sec. IV al-
lowed us to show how the AR approach –with all its unfa-
miliar aspects listed in Table I – emerges naturally from
an adiabatic state-evolution approach similar to closed
systems by just a single physical operation: discarding
the meter, i.e., shifting the boundary from Fig. 1(b) to
Fig. 1(a).

VII. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

Starting from an explicit model of system, reservoirs
and an ideal meter we have shown that geometric ef-
fects in driven transport have their direct origin in the
In

contrast to Ref. 23 where only the ﬁrst moment / cumu-
lant was addressed, this applies to the entire transport
process, i.e., all possible charge measurements performed
on the meter, or, equivalently, all moments / cumulants
of the transported charge. The recalibration allows for
a “noisy” meter (with known noise) that counts charges
using mixed quantum states instead of the pure ones as-
sumed in Ref. 57. Notably, physical recalibrations form
only a semigroup in the group of all possible geometric
gauges since they must satisfy the nontrivial restrictions
of Bochner’s criterion for positive probability distribu-
tions. Nevertheless, one can make use of the full geo-
metric gauge group to apply standard considerations of
connections on a ﬁber bundle.

We showed that two widely used approaches to pump-
ing –full counting statistics (FCS) and adiabatic response
(AR)– transparently follow from our approach. We
showed their many crucial diﬀerences in Table I all go
back to the choice of the open system boundary, either in-
cluding or excluding the meter. In particular, the central
issue of the (non)adiabaticity of pumping transport was
fully clariﬁed this way. We also noted that by the compu-
tational choice of working either with moments (AR) or
cumulants (FCS) one decides where one places the open-
system boundary and commits oneself to one of the two

entirely focuses on the average pumped charge – as of-
ten done– this is easily overlooked since the ﬁrst moment
equals the ﬁrst cumulant.

Finally, we showed that when going beyond the av-
erage charge, the probability distributions that appear
both in the ASE and FCS approach may turn into non-
positive functions when working in certain gauges. As we
explained, this is a generic situation but it is not problem-
atic since the computed results are gauge invariant: un-
like closed systems the “intermediate” picture obtained
in some gauges need not make physical sense. That the
physical constraint of positivity is incompatible with ge-

ometric gauge structure, is important if one wants to use
gauge invariance as a principle for constructing models
within the open system approach (Liouville space).

Finally, we comment on the few simplifying assump-

tions that we made:

(i) We limited our attention to the AR approach as
formulated for the ﬁrst moment M(1). However, an ex-
tension of the AR approach to all moments M(k) is possi-
ble by calculating additional observable memory kernels.
This leads to additional Landsberg geometric phases, one
for each M(k), which are nontrivially related [Eq. (A11)
ﬀ.] to the cumulants C(k) obtained by Eq. (77) from the
Berry-Simon phases of ASE/ FCS approach.

(ii) Although for clarity we have focused on charge
transport, our considerations can be extended to spin-
tronics (spin counting75) quantum thermodynamics (en-
ergy / heat transport46,76,77 and simultaneously measur-
able quantities (multi-counting statistics22).

(iii) For simplicity, we assumed that the eigenvalues wφ
0
are gapped for all φ [Eq. (39)] but we noted that crossings
of the eigenvalues may in principle occur. This leads to
interesting topological eﬀects studied recently in72,73 and
our considerations can be adapted to this.

(iv) Importantly, even when maintaining the strong
restrictions of the ideal meter model –underlying all dis-
cussed approaches (ASE, FCS, AR)– many of the pre-
sented considerations can be extended further, in partic-
ular, to general non-Markovian open-system dynamics.
(vi) Finally, we raise the interesting question how our
relation between meter calibration (gauge freedom) and
pumping eﬀects (geometric phases) is modiﬁed when ex-
tending the model beyond Ref. 57 to non-ideal measure-
ments. It seems promising to combine our approach with
related insights from quantum-information and measure-
ment theory (“quantum instruments”).

Appendix A: Moments and cumulants

In this appendix we discuss the diﬀerent moments and

cumulants used in Sects. IV-V and verify Eq. (48),

(cid:104) ˆN k(cid:105)(T ) = M(k).

(A1)

We distinguish between measurements on the reservoir
(charge operator ˆn) as considered in most works48 and
the measurements on the ideal meter (meter position ˆN ).

ˆn = (cid:80)
n n ˆOn with projective measurement operators ˆOn,
assuming that [ˆn, ρR] = 0, and tracing out the system (S)
and reservoirs (R):

(A3)

where U is the evolution operator from time 0 to T .

For App. B we note that the k-th moment is simply the
average of the kth-power of the change of the Heisenberg
charge operator ˆn(t),

M(k) = (cid:104) ˆT [ˆn(T ) − ˆn(0)]k(cid:105)

(A4)

provided one time-orders the expression by ˆT . By def-
inition, the generating function has Taylor coeﬃcients
proportional to the moments:

Summing the series with Eq. (A4), one obtains78–80:

Z φ = (cid:104)e−iφˆn(T )eiφˆn(0)(cid:105)

= (cid:104) ˆT e−iφ[ˆn(T )−ˆn(0)](cid:105) = (cid:104) ˆT e−iφ (cid:82) T

0 dt ˆIn(t)(cid:105).

(A6a)

(A6b)

Meter charge ˆN : 1-point moments. By construction
of the ideal meter model, changes of the reservoir charge
ˆn are exactly copied to the meter position ˆN : the prob-
abilities for measuring the same change ∆n = ∆N be-
tween times 0 and T are thus equal:

p∆N = P ∆N .

(A7)

Thus, from the time-propagation of the ﬁrst r moments
(cid:104) ˆN (cid:105), (cid:104) ˆN 2(cid:105), . . . , (cid:104) ˆN r(cid:105) of the meter one should be able to
extract the ﬁrst r moments of interest M(1), . . . , M(r)
(or the ﬁrst r cumulants). Below we establish this recur-
sive relation [Eq. (A10)]. Moreover, when initializing the
meter to |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0|, this simpliﬁes to Eq. (A1). Thus the for-
mulas of Sec. IV –based on 1-point meter measurements–
indeed produce the exact 2-point statistics (A1) of charge
transport to the left reservoir. There are three steps:
(i) Without the adiabatic / steady-state limit the system-
meter state has the form (38). Tracing out the system,

the meter density operator (42) at time t = T reads28
|||ρM(T )))) = (cid:80)
|||N (cid:48)))). Therefore, the charge-
diagonal elements P N (t) = (cid:104)N |ρM(t)|N (cid:105) = (((N |ρM(t))))
evolve as

N (cid:48) Z −N (cid:48)

P N (cid:48)

(T ) =

(cid:88)

N

Z −(N (cid:48)−N )P N (0)

(A8)

where we restored for clarity a general initial condition,
instead of P N (0) = δN,0 used in the main text.
(ii) The conditional distribution deﬁned by P N (cid:48)
(cid:80)
N P N (cid:48)|N P N (0) is thus translation invariant:

(T ) =

P N (cid:48)|N = Z −(N (cid:48)−N ) = P ∆N (cid:12)

(cid:12)∆N =N (cid:48)−N .

(A9)

Then the expectation value of ˆN k at time T reads

(cid:104) ˆN q(cid:105)(0) = δq,0 in Eq. (A10) which gives the result (A1).
Reservoir charge ˆn: 2-point cumulants. Finally,
in
Sec. V we used that the transport process as a whole
is characterized either by all cumulants or all moments.
This relies on the explicit relation

which is obtained by inserting the series Eq. (A5) and
zφ = (cid:80)∞
k! C(k)(−iφ)k into zφ = ln Z φ. The rela-
k=0
tion (A11) is nonlinear for k ≥ 2 which complicates the
comparison of geometric approaches that compute mo-
ments (AR) on the one hand, and cumulants (FCS) on
the other. For this reason the present paper focused on
comparing C(1) = M(1).

Appendix B: Recalibrating the reservoir charge ˆn?

Here we point out how gauge transformations enter
in formulations that do not use an open-system (den-
sity operator) formulation and provide some comments.
When expression (A6) is used as a starting point, then
the gauge transformations Gφ = egφ
discussed
in the main text correspond to the formal replacements56

= e−iφγφ

ˆn(t) → ˆn(t) + γφ1 or

ˆIn(t) → ˆIn(t) + ∂tγφ1 (B1)

with γφ(t) = γφ[R(t)] Also, γφ|φ=0 = −∂iφgφ|φ=0 = g(1)
and γφ = −(γ−φ)∗ since gφ|φ=0 = 0 and gφ = (g−φ)∗.

For the φ-independent case γφ = g the gauge trans-
formation (B1) physically corresponds to parametrically
changing the charge operator in time, ˆn(t) → ˆn(t) +
g[R(t)]1, which will cancel out in the change ˆn(T )− ˆn(0).
This only captures the gauge freedom of the observable
(86), responsible for geometric pumping of the ﬁrst mo-
ment M(1) / cumulant C(1) as discussed in Sec. VI. How-
ever, the gauge freedom responsible for the geometric
higher moments / cumulants discussed in the main text
arises when γφ is φ-dependent, in which case it is less
clear what Eq. (B1) physically means.

Another problem is that one cannot really consider the
counting ﬁeld φ in Eq. (B1) as the conjugate to the reser-
voir charge observable ˆn. First, the replacement (B1),
would amount to shifting the operator ˆn by the eigen-
value of its noncommuting conjugate ˆφ, which is diﬃcult
to understand. Moreover, it is known in quantum mea-
surement and estimation theory81 that due to the lower
bound n = 0 of the spectrum there does not exist any
phase observable operator29 that is conjugate to a Fock-
occupation operator (such as ˆn).

None of these complications arise in the ideal meter
model (6) that we used following Ref. 57: the charge op-
erator ˆN has a well-deﬁned conjugate observable ˆφ be-
cause ˆN is the position-operator for the meter needle
running from −∞ to ∞. It is an excess charge operator
that registers discrete changes of ˆn in the reservoirs, sim-
ilar to the situation in, e.g., superconductivity58–60 and
the P (E)-theory of electromagnetic circuits61–63.

Appendix C: Measurable geometric phase and
parametrically nonstationary state.

In Sec. III and Sec. IV we found that in open systems
the geometric phase is accumulated in the parametrically
nonstationary part of the quantum state and remarked
that the same is true for closed systems. The latter
point easily goes unnoticed when working with state vec-
from the parametric eigenkets H|km(cid:105) =
tors as usual:

28 The negative sign in Z−N indicates that charge N counted by
the meter and entering the reservoir is lost on the system (−N ).

29 Such a phase does have description as a POVM-measurement

(projection-valued operator measure).

km|km(cid:105) one constructs the adiabatic approximation to
the solution of d
dt |ψ(t)(cid:105) = −iH(t)|ψ(t)(cid:105), starting from
an arbitrary superposition |ψ(0)(cid:105) = (cid:80)
m cm(0)|km(0)(cid:105)
of parametric eigenstates of H(0). Decoupling of the
eigenspaces gives |ψ(t)(cid:105) = (cid:80)
m ezm(t)cm(0)|km(t)(cid:105) where
each term seems to have an imaginary phase zm(t) =
−i (cid:82) T

0 dtkm(t) − (cid:82) T
However, consider the corresponding density operator:

0 dt(cid:104)km| d

dt |km(t)(cid:105).

m(cid:48)(cid:54)=m

In Eq. (C1a) all closed-system phases have canceled out.
This is the parametrically stationary part which would be
time-independent if the parameters were ﬁxed. The mea-
surable phases appear only in the parametrically non-
stationary part (C1b) of the state. This expresses that
single state-vector geometric phases are not measurable
(like any absolute phase in quantum physics).

A second point made by Eq. (C1) is that consideration
of measurements is also crucial for understanding geo-
metric phases in closed systems. To observe a geometric
phase one needs some interference measurement82.

ing to interference terms (C1b) with observable phase

diﬀerence.
tem with simple reference phases and lets the two com-
ponents interfere.
In the latter case, one veriﬁes that
when actually including this auxiliary system into the
pure state description, the phases of interest appear as
observable phase diﬀerences in the parametrically non-
stationary part (C1b) of the composite state. Whereas
for a closed system this is all clear, the main text of the
paper discusses this in the more complicated setting of
open systems, cf. also Ref. 19.

Here we show how the Fock variational condition, that

we generalized to mixed-state evolution in Eq. (35),

dt ¯ρ| d

is stationary

(D1)

when varied over all operators ρ, is equivalent to the par-
allel transport condition Eq. (34) as it arises from adia-
batic evolution. First, in Eq. (D1) the bar is understood
as follows in terms of the left- and right eigenvectors:

each term is time-independent: (((¯km|km))) = 1. Functional
variation of the expression (D1) with respect to the coef-
ﬁcients is eﬀected by replacing cm → cme(cid:15)gm, maintain-
ing the constancy of each term Eq. (D3), expanding to
O((cid:15)), and noting that the gauge exponent gm(R(t)) is a
parametric function of time. Using

Appendix E: Steady-state limit

In this appendix we discuss the transition to the steady
state in Eqs. (39) and (40). Our expressions in Secs. IV-
V are consistent with those of Ref. 28 and we comment
on a diﬀerent expression obtained in Ref. 22. To obtain

has already been performed in Eq. (E1a), the step (E1b)
only concerns the steady-state limit. This can be un-
derstood clearly by considering measurable quantities:
since we consider slow driving, T (cid:29) Γ−1 ∝ ˙R, the
cumulant current (78) reaches a time-dependent steady-
state already at the beginning of the ﬁrst driving period,

ﬁrst term, the sum of “snapshots”, takes the same “snap-

Extra contribution in Ref. 22. Notably, Ref. 22 does
not set cφ

− (cid:72)
0 relative to Ref. 28 and the present pa-
per. The authors of Ref. 22 rationalize this diﬀerence
by noting that the extra term does not contribute to the
ﬁrst cumulant C(1) (pumped charge). Although this last
observation is correct30 provided one assumes that ρ(0)
is initialized as the parametric stationary state |||w0))), this
does not take away the fact that higher moments really
do depend on the initial condition through cφ
0 : the mod-
iﬁed result does not apply to the steady-state FCS. For
the above reason this did not lead to any inconsistencies
in Ref. 22 when their FCS result was compared with the
steady-state AR result for the ﬁrst moment only. How-
ever, when comparing with other FCS works, Ref. 23 or
the present paper one should ignore the extra term in
Ref. 22. In the present paper we consistently treat each
of the compared approaches (ASE, FCS, and AR) in the
steady-state limit.

Appendix F: Bochner’s criterion and
gauge transformations

Bochner’s criterion. Bochner’s criterion31 states that
the inverse Fourier transform GN of a smooth function
Gφ of φ ∈ [−π, π] is a positive (semideﬁnite) function,
GN ≥ 0 for all N ∈ Z, if and only if the associated
quadratic form

k Gφk−φk(cid:48) vk(cid:48) ≥ 0
v∗

(F1)

(cid:88)

kk(cid:48)

is positive (semideﬁnite) for an arbitrary ﬁnite complex
vector with components vk and a corresponding arbitrary
discrete sampling of Fourier frequencies φk ∈ [−π, π].
The “if” part is easily veriﬁed and a constructive proof
of the converse can be found in Ref. 83.

Examples of Fig. 4(c). The criterion (F1) is easily
veriﬁed for phase factors Gφ = eiN φ with a ﬁxed discrete
N ∈ Z. It can easily be made to fail as illustrated for
ﬁnite Fourier sums Gφ = (cid:80)
N GN eiN φ in Fig. 4(c) of the
main text. These examples indicate that the splitting of
a function into a convolution of two positive ones is rather
rare unless it involves transformations close to shifts. For

The ﬁnal example of a negative gauge and a resulting

negative solution Sφ

2 e0φ − 1e1iφ + 2e2iφ − 1e3iφ + 1

2 e4iφ.

30 The extra term in Ref. 22 ln cφ

0 in the geometric phase zφ
in principle gives an extra contribution to M(1) = C(1) =
−∂iφ exp(zφ)|φ=0 equal to −∂iφcφ
0 |φ=0 = 0 calculated as follows.
We already assumed |||ρ(0)))) = |||ρS(0)))) ⊗ |||ρM(0)))) and initialized
the meter in the pure state ρM(0) = |||0))) = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| and we now as-
sume also that the system is initially stationary, |||ρS(0)))) = |||w0))).
0 = (((¯k0,φ|ρ(0)))) = ((( ¯wφ
This gives cφ
0 |w0))) by Eq. (37b) for l = 0
and using (((φ|0))) = 1. Using Eq.
(126) of Ref. 23, we obtain
cφ
0 = (((1|w0))) − iφ(((1|||WIN W −1|||w0))) = 1 + O(φ2) since the pseudo-
inverse W −1 projects out |||w0))). This gives −∂iφcφ

0 |φ=0 = 0.

These examples indicate given an arbitrary positive
gauge GN , the corresponding solution SN may require
negative values to adjust the gauge distribution (e.g., its
width) to the target Z N
g .

31 Eq. (F1) is actually Herglotz result, a special case of Bochner’s

more general criterion.

Appendix G: Calibrating meter observables

and meter states

Here we explain the point made at the end of Sec. VI
that for the ﬁrst moment M(1) the gauge transforma-
tion of the observable ˆN can always be understood phys-
ically as arising from some recalibration of the meter
states |||N))) = |N (cid:105)(cid:104)N | to mixed states. As shown there, a
meter-gauge Gφ = (cid:80)
N GN eiφN determines a real-valued
observable-gauge ˆN → ˆN + g through −∂iφGφ|φ=0 =
(cid:80)
N N GN = g. Here, the geometric gauge freedom –
unconstrained by physics– allows Gφ to be any function
(not necessarily with positive Fourier transform GN .) We
now show conversely that for a given observable gauge g,
one can ﬁnd many state gauges GN that produce this
value since their diﬀerences cancel out in (cid:80)
N N GN = g.
Moreover, these functions always include positive ones
which correspond to a physical mixing of the meter states
[Sec. IV D]. One simple construction of a class of positive
meter gauges is

GN = (1 − | g

k |) δN,0 + | g

k | δN,k.

(G1)

25

The weighted sum (cid:80)
N N GN achieves the value g by a
single contribution at integer value k with sign k = sign g.
Both nonzero values of GN are positive if k is taken suf-
ﬁciently large (|k| ≥ g) but other than this k is arbitrary.
When g is parameter dependent, k can always be chosen
large enough such that GN ≥ 0 for all R values accessed
during the driving cycle. One can thus always consider
the observable gauge g as arising from some physical mix-
ing of meter states during a pumping cycle.

Whereas example (G1) is only piecewise diﬀerentiable
for |g| > 0 (which is suﬃcient) one can also construct a
diﬀerentiable gauge:

GN = 1

2 (1 − g

k ) δN,−k + 1

2 (1 + g

k ) δN,k

(G2)

Now the weighted sum achieves the given value of g by
two unequal contributions with positive weights if |k| ≥
g. This has the side eﬀect that the trivial observable
gauge g = 0 corresponds to a nontrivial (“noisy”) meter-
state GN = (δN,−k + δN,k)/2, which is ﬁne if one only
considers the ﬁrst moment.
