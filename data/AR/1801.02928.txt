Solar Active Region (AR) 12673 is the most ﬂare productive AR in the solar cycle 24.
It
produced four X-class ﬂares including the X9.3 ﬂare on 06 September 2017 and the X8.2 limb event
on 10 September. Sun & Norton (2017) reported that this region had an unusual high rate of ﬂux
emergence, while Huang et al. (2018) reported that the X9.3 ﬂare had extremely strong white-light
ﬂare emissions. Yang at al. (2017) described the detailed morphological evolution of this AR. In
this study, we focus on usual behaviors of the light bridge (LB) dividing the δ conﬁguration of
this AR, namely the strong magnetic ﬁelds in the LB and apparent photospheric twist as shown in
observations with a 0.1′′ spatial resolution obtained by the 1.6 m GST (Cao et al. 2010) at BBSO.

Both vector magnetograms from the spectropolarimeter (SP) of Hinode’s Solar Optical Tele-
scope (SOT) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Ob-
servatory use Stokes inversion with the maximum magnetic ﬁeld strength limited to 5000 G. This
limitation is valid for the vast majority of solar ARs. In previous studies, the highest magnetic ﬁeld
was reported to be 4300 G at the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) dividing δ sunspots (Zirin
& Wang 1993), where the strong ﬁeld is parallel to the solar surface. Very recently, Okamoto &
Sakurai (2018) reported strong ﬁelds as high as 6250 G, also at the PIL region. Viewing Hinode/SP
and SDO/HMI magnetograms of the AR 12673, we noted many pixels along the ﬂaring PIL are
saturated at the maximum value of 5000 G. This motivated us to examine Stokes proﬁles recorded
by the Near Infra-Red Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) of GST – a Fabry-P´erot based imaging
Stokes polarimeter that provides scanning of 60 line positions of the Fe i 1.56µm line (Wang et al.,
2017). With the large Lande factor (g=3.0) at long wavelength, the Zeeman splitting is large.

In Figures 1(a) and (b), we show the line-of-sight (LOS) and transverse magnetic ﬁeld strength
using the Hinode/SP level 2 data. They are obtained a few hours after the X9.3 ﬂare on 06
September 2017. While the LOS ﬁelds are under 5000 G, the transverse ﬁelds have several patches
at the saturation level of 5000 G. These patches are concentrated at the two PIL segments of the
δ conﬁguration, as outlined by the two white boxes. To investigate the properties of these two
areas, we study the corresponding photospheric structures with BBSO/GST observations in the

TiO band, a good proxy for the photospheric continuum. It is obvious from Figure 1(c) that LBs
in these two sections of strongest transverse ﬁeld areas exhibit a prominent alternating bright-dark
spiral structure, which are diﬀerent from the usual appearance of LBs such as those shown by Wang
et al. (2018). Notably, the observed spiral ﬁlaments are not parallel to the PIL as is usually seen in
the regular LBs, and implied by Yang et al. (2017) for strong shear along PIL. In Figure 1(d), we
show a selected NIRIS Stokes U proﬁle in the northern boxed region, where Hinode/SP level 2 data
are saturated at 5000 G. Three Zeeman components are clearly seen. A direct measurement of the
1.9˚A Zeeman splitting (∆λ = 4.67 × 10−13gλ2B) yields a ﬁeld strength B of 5570 G, about 1300 G
above what Zirin & Wang (1993) found for the strongest ﬁelds in ﬂare productive δ sunspots.

Combining the very strong transverse ﬁeld at the PIL and the spiral photospheric structure, it
is natural to ask: are they signatures of a twisted magnetic ﬂux rope right at the photospheric level?
Signiﬁcant eﬀorts will be devoted to further improve Stokes inversion of the Hinode/SP, SDO/HMI,
and GST/NIRIS data. Okamoto & Sakurai (2018) suggested the possibility that formation of a
strong ﬁeld may be due to the compression of ﬁelds at the two sides of a PIL. Recent numerical
simulations by Toriumi & Takasao (2017) revealed that the strongly sheared PIL of δ sunspots is
created by combined action of advection, stretching, and compression of magnetic ﬁelds. These will
motivate further analyses of the data and comparison with simulation to explain both the strong
ﬁelds and the spiral LB structure of this AR. Furthermore, these unusual behaviors may be related
to its high productivity of major ﬂares.
