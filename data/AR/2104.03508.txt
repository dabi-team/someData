Abstract—With 

(Wireless 
evolution 
communication  networks),  the  absolute  fulfillment  of  security 
occupies  the  fundamental  concern.  In  view  of  security,  we  have 
identified  another  research  direction  based  on  the  attenuation 
impact  of  rain  in  WCN.  An  approach  is  initiated  by  an 
eavesdropper  in  which  a  secure  communication  environment  is 
degraded  by  generating  Artificial  Rain  (AR),  which  creates  an 
abatement  in  the  secrecy  rate,  and  the  cybersecurity  gets 
compromised. By doing so, an attacking scenario is perceived, in 
which  an  intruder  models  a  Half-Duplex  (HD)  attack.  Half-
Duplex specifies the attack on the downlink instead of targeting 
both uplink and downlink. This allows the attacker to alleviate the 
miss-rate of the attacking attempts. The layout for the HD attack 
is explained using RRC (Radio Resource Control)-setup. Further, 
we have determined and examined the performance parameters 
such as secrecy rate, energy efficiency, miss-rate, sensitivity in the 
presence of AR. Further comparison of rural and urban scenarios 
in the presence and absence of AR is carried out concerning the 
variation  in  secrecy  rate  with  respect  to  the  millimeter-wave 
frequencies  and  distance.  Lastly,  the  methodology  of  the  HD 
attack is simulated, revealing that the HD attack maintains a low 
miss  rate  with  improved  performance  as  compared  to  the 
performance and miss-rate attained by the full-duplex attack.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The  visualization  of  6G  (Sixth  Generation)  reflects  the 
presumption  of 
the  user  demand,  onward  novelties, 
technological  potentials  in  the  form  of  ultra-high  data  rates 
(100-1000  Gb/s),  long-range  services,  ultralow-power  usage, 
low  latency  [1].  Since  5G  is  expected  to  justify  10x  more 
connectivity density [2], 100x more energy efficiency [3] and, 
1000x  more  capacity  [4]  as  compared  to  the  existing 
communication  network.  With  the  progression  of  such 
requirements, certain advances were encompassed in 5G, such 
as the  involvement of clouds  in  network communication and 
processing,  flat  architectures,  and  heterogeneous  networks 
(WiFi hotspots, microcells, small cells, femtocells) [5]. Thus, 
due  to  centralized  architecture,  the  susceptibility  of  security 
threats  increased  [6].  From  preceding  years,  security  threats 
involve  numerous  attacks  on  the  measures  of  cybersecurity, 
such as confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and authentication.

      The  paramount  phenomenon  of  the  weather  is  the 
occurrence  of  the  hydrometeors.  The  existence  of  the 
hydrometeors  occurs  in  the  form  of  rain,  graupel,  hail,  and 

snow  produce  the  effect  of  absorption  and  scattering.  This 
effect  creates  an  attenuation  impact  on  the  propagation  of 
electromagnetic  waves.  These  are  severely  affected  at 
frequencies greater than 10 GHz due to the reduction of power 
density [8]. In case of 5G NR (New Radio), the second band of 
frequency  24  GHz  to  52.6  GHz  [17]  incorporates  higher 
frequencies. The particles of the rain in the wireless channel at 
higher  frequencies  create  the  stern  impact  of  scattering  and 
absorption in the path of the transmitted signal [18], [19]. In 
the present era of WCN, the attenuation due to rainfall on the 
propagating  signal 
is  not  equitably  approximated.  The 
attenuation  of  the  signal  has  a  considerable  effect  when  the 
diameter of the raindrop lies in the range from 0.1mm to 10mm 
is less than the operating wavelength of the signal. An impact 
of rainfall attenuation in mmWave (Millimeter Wave) MIMO 
system shows an increase of capacities and achievable rates at 
low  rain  rates  due  to  a  decrease  of  antenna  correlation.  At 
medium and high rain rates, there occurs a decrease of capacity 
and achievable rates with an increase in rain rates [7].  
      Various approaches were followed to determine the impact 
of  rainfall  attenuation  on 
the  propagating  signal.  The 
approaches involved in these prediction methods include ITU-
R  P.837-6  (International  Telecommunication  Union  Radio 
Communication) sector, MORSE (Model for Rainfall Statistics 
Estimation), 
ITU-R  P.837-7.  These  prediction 
methodologies  are  compared  on  the  basis  of  the  accuracy  of 
prediction  [8].  A  global  model  of  prediction  provides  much 
higher  accuracy  and  more  excellent  spatial  resolution  by 
making the use of CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group Infrared 
Precipitation  with  Stations)  [10].  Another  approach  involves 
the performance analysis of mmWaves under the rainfall and 
non-rainfall scenario. The analysis is determined on account of 
WPT  (Wireless  Power  transfer)  under  the  consideration  of 
rainfall and non-rainfall effects, small scale fading, path loss, 
and  the  energy  propagation  models  [9].  Effective  use  of 
calculated  signal  attenuation  in  the  presence  or  absence  of 
rainfall  can  be  utilized  to  determine  the  accumulation  of 
hydrometeors along with the communicating link. Satellite link 
signal  attenuation  operating  at  12.3  GHz  can  be  exploited to 
estimate  the  accumulation  of  rainfall  in  the  path  link.  To 
compute  such,  the  power-law  relation  between  the  rate  of 
attenuation and rate of rainfall is evaluated [11]. 
       D2D  communication  executes  a  crucial  role  in  next-
generation WCNs. It possesses the ability to offload  massive 
data traffic by enlightening the utilization of network resources, 
providing  short-range  communication  and  proximity-based 
services . In spite of its numerous advantages, several security

menaces  are  emerging  with  an  increasing  number  of  devices 
[12].  Another  scheme  of  security  improvement  includes  the 
combined  optimization  of  channel  assignment  and  power 
allocation  of  communicating  D2D  links  where  downlink 
resource sharing is used via multi-channel and single channel 
communication  [13].  For  multiple  eavesdroppers,  one  of  the 
approach  to  enable  secure  communication  is  the  access 
selection scheme, where D2D users are present at the distance 
greater than the threshold such that interference is created by 
the  specific  D2D  user  to  craft  the  jamming  impact  on  the 
attacker  [14].  A  security  embedded  interference  avoidance 
scheme is evaluated where the constellation rotation technique 
is used. Thereby improving the PLS (Physical Layer Security) 
of the network [15]. Another mechanism that can improve the 
security  of  the  relay  device  is  SLNR  (Signal  to  leakage  and 
noise ratio) precoding scheme. It improves the security of the 
network by balancing out the noise and interference [27].  

B.  Contribution 
       In  this  paper,  the  attack  modelling  is  proposed  in  next 
generation  WCN.  The  target  scenario  inspects  the  D2D 
communication network. The attack involves the execution of 
AR  followed  by  the  commencement  of  HD  attack.  The 
fundamental contribution of this paper is specified as follows: 
1.  A  system  model  is  signified  with  an  unknown  CSI 
(Channel  State  Information).  The  intruder  is  capable  of 
monitoring  the  location  of  the  users  from  the  BS  (Base 
Station).  The  user  with  worst  channel  conditions  is 
targeted for the attack. 

2.  The  AR  attenuation  incorporating  security  analysis  is 
implemented  on  the  user  with  deteriorated  CSI.  The 
examination is performed in rural and urban scenarios to 
define the secrecy rate analysis for the attack.  

3.  HD attack is initiated on the targeted user. The resources 
that  are  supposed  to  be  allocated  to  the  valid  user  are 
spoofed by the intruder. 

4.  The comparison on the basis of performance in terms of  

sensitivity,  miss-rate,  and  energy  efficiency  is  evaluated 
between HD, and FD (Full-Duplex) attack. 

The  organization  of  the  paper  is  mentioned  as:  The  system 
model and the problem formulation is represented in Section II. 
Section  III  demonstrates  the  general  mechanism  of  the  HD 
attack. An Illustrative Mechanism of HD attack with the help 
of an example is discussed in Section IV. The analysis of the 
simulation  results  is  performed  in  Section  V.  Finally,  the 
conclusion of the paper is specified in Section VI 

II.  SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION 

       The  system  model  demonstrating  the  scenario  of  AR, 
followed  by  the  problem  formulation,  is  investigated  in  this 
section. 

A.  System Model 
      The proposed system  model is characterized by two case 
scenarios, followed by the execution of an HD attack. The first 
case determines the background of WCN in the absence of an 
eavesdropper  without  AR  devoid  of  an  intruder.  The  recent 
mechanism  for  the  generation  of  AR  is  given  in  [20].  The 
second  case  demonstrates  the  framework  of  WCN  in  the 
presence  of  an  intruder,  triggering  AR.  Further  HD  attack  is 
formulated  in  the  communication  scenario  incorporating 
security analysis.  

1)  Case I: Scenario of WCN devoid of an intruder 
      Consider a signal under 5G WCN in which the transmitter 
𝐴 at a distance of 𝑟 transmits a signal 𝑦(𝑡) to receiver 𝐵 or vice 
versa.  Assume  negligible,  or  no  hindrance  condition  in  the 
communicating link in reference to the transmitter and receiver 
representing free space WCN and the signal is propagating in 
a straight path. The path loss of free space presents a complex 
factor of scaling in the receiving signal such that the received 
signal 𝑧(𝑡) can be calculated as:

where 𝐵𝑙 is the product of field radiation patterns of transmit 
antenna and receive antenna, 𝑒−
𝜆  denotes the phase shift that 
arises due to the traveling distance 𝑟 of the wave from transmit 
antenna  to  receive  antenna,  𝜆  depicts  the  wavelength  of 
radiation, 𝑦(𝑡) denotes the complex baseband signal and is the 
combination  of  an  in-phase  component,  and  quadrature 
component is given by: 

𝑦(𝑡) = 𝑢𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑗𝑢𝑄(𝑡)                              (2) 
where  𝑢𝐼(𝑡) is  the  real  part  of  𝑦(𝑡)  and  denotes  in-phase 
component and 𝑢𝑄(𝑡) is the imaginary part of 𝑦(𝑡) and denotes 
the quadrature component. The ratio of the received power 𝑃𝑟 
to transmit power 𝑃𝑡 is given by: 
=   [√𝐵𝑙 𝜆

Approximated  path  loss  model  as  a  function  of  distance  𝑟  is

where  q  is  a  dimensionless  constant  depending  on  the 
characteristics of average attenuation of channel and antenna, 
𝑟𝑜  is  the  distance  of  reference,  𝜓  is  the  path  loss  exponent. 
Where q can be expressed as:

be evaluated as:

where  |𝐾|2 = −𝑃𝑙 (𝑑𝑏)  and  defines  the  channel  gain.  The 
capacity denoted by 𝐶𝑢 can also be expressed using the theorem 
of Shannon’s capacity as:  

𝐶𝑢 = log2(1 + 𝜍)                                  (12) 
Where  𝐶𝑢  is  the  capacity  of  a  legitimate  user  without 
eavesdropper’s intervention. 
2)  Case 2: Attacking scenario using Artificial Rain (AR) 

      Consider  the  WCN  in  the  presence  of  an  intruder.  An 
assumption is made that the intruder is capable of achieving the 
location of the users from the Base Station (BS). The location 
of the users from the BS is achieved by TPA [22] technique. 
As shown in Fig. 2, in the region 1, the users distant from the 
BS require more energy and are thereby less energy efficient.

𝑁𝑅  is  the  specific  attenuation  and  depends  on  the  dielectric 
properties of the rain droplet and its composition. 𝑁𝑅 due to AR 
can be determined by using power-law relationship given as: 

𝑁𝑅 = 𝜃𝑅𝜀                                    (16) 
Where 𝜃 and 𝜀 are the coefficients of specific attenuation and 
depend  on  the  frequency  f  (in  GHz).  These  coefficients  are 
expressed as: 

4
𝑙𝑜𝑔10 𝜃 =   ∑ (𝛿𝑖 𝑒𝑥𝑝 [− (
𝑖=1

2

𝑙𝑜𝑔10 𝑓−𝜁𝑖
𝜗𝑖

)

]) + 𝑎𝑘 𝑙𝑜𝑔10 𝑓 + 𝑏𝑘

(17)  
where f is the frequency, a, b, 𝛿, 𝑥, and 𝑦 are coefficients of 𝜃, 
and 𝜀 can be determined as : 

𝜀 = ∑ (𝛿𝑖 𝑒𝑥𝑝 [− (

4
𝑖=1

𝑙𝑜𝑔10 𝑓−𝑥𝑖

)

]) + 𝑎𝑘 𝑙𝑜𝑔10 𝑓 + 𝑏𝑘

   (18) 

The  coefficient  𝜃  can  be  determined  either  for  horizontal 
polarization 𝜃𝐻  alternatively,  for  vertical  polarization 𝜃𝑉. 
Similarly,  𝜀  can  also  be  determined 
for  horizontal 
polarization (𝜀𝐻)  or  vertical  polarization  (𝜀𝑉).  For  circular, 
linear and other path geometries the coefficients 𝜃 and 𝜀 can be 
calculated as: 

(𝜃𝐻+ 𝜃𝑉+(𝜃𝐻−𝜃𝑉) cos2𝛼 cos2𝛽)

Where 𝛼 is the angle of path elevation and 𝛽is the tilt angle of 
polarization relative to the horizontal. Also, channel gain with 
the effect of AR can be given as: 

|𝐾′|2 = −𝑃′

B.  Analysis of secrecy capacity 

     The approach to analyze the security of the communication 
network involves the parameter of secrecy capacity, obtained 
from  wireless  wiretap  theory.  It  is  defined  as  the  difference 
between channel capacities of valid user and intruder, given by: 
𝐶𝑠 = [𝐶𝑢 − (𝐶𝑒𝑣)]+             ∀   𝐶𝑢 ≥ 𝐶𝑒𝑣    (24) 

For a secured WCN  

𝐶𝑠 > 𝐶𝑇                                     (25) 
The intruder attempts to decrease the  secrecy capacity below 
threshold capacity by creating the attacking scenario such that  
𝐶𝑠 < 𝐶𝑇                                        (26) 
To  achieve  such,  AR  is  introduced  by  the  intruder  in  the 
communication setup where attenuation due to AR decreases 
the  secrecy  capacity  as  compared  to  the  secrecy  capacity 
achieved without intruder given by:  

𝐶𝑠 > (𝐶𝑠)𝐴𝑅                                     (27) 
The total of secrecy capacity is required to be reduced to satisfy 
the  criteria  of  equation  (26)  for  the  initiation  of  an  attack.  It 
depends upon the sum of rain rate added in the communicating 
environment. However, the required amount of AR attenuation 

Fig. 2. Location tracking of the user using TPA technique 
In  other  word,  with  an  increase  in  distance  from  the  BS,  the 
energy requirement tends to increase. Therefore, following the 
footprint of energy pattern analysis the location of the users is 
determined.  Based  on  the  parameter  of  distance,  CSI  is 
analyzed  by  using  the  mathematical  modelling  given  in  this 
section. To degrade the SNR of the communication channel, an 
attempt is made by an intruder in the form of artificial seeding 
of the clouds to create AR. The attenuation occurring in a signal 
while traveling through obstacles in the form of rain droplets 
with depth 𝑑𝑅 is given by: 

𝑑𝑅 =   𝑑𝑆𝐶 +   𝑑𝐴𝐵 + 𝑑𝑃𝑂𝐿                 (13) 

Such that attenuation due to rainfall can be given as: 

𝑥′(𝑑𝑅) =   𝑒𝑁𝑅𝑑𝑅                          (14) 
Where  𝑥′(𝑑𝑅)  denotes  the  attenuation  of  a  signal  due  to 
artificial  rain.  The  equation  (10)  for  path  loss,  including  the 
effect of artificial rain attenuation, can be expressed as:

by: 

                (𝐶𝑠)𝐴𝑅 = 𝐶𝑢 − (𝐶𝑒𝑣)𝐴𝑅 < 𝐶𝑇                       (28) 
 It can be concluded, that with an increase in AR attenuation, 
the secrecy capacity reduces correspondingly. Therefore, at a 
specific rate of AR attenuation secrecy rate reduces below the 
threshold  capacity.  The  prime  aspect  of  the  system  model 
shows  the  effect  on  the  secrecy  rate  of  the  channel  while 
degrading  the  capacity  of  the  main  channel.  The  resultant 
observation from equation (26) and (28) predicts an increased 
chance of successful spoofing. (See Lemma 1)                           
Remarks 1: The threshold capacity is obtained at a threshold 
distance, and in our scenario, threshold distance is achieved to 
be  150m. Below threshold distance, the  achieved capacity of 
the  valid  user  is  greater  than  the  capacity  obtained  by  the 
intruder capacity. 
The attack modelling can prove advantageous to strengthen the 
defence  communication  network  of  a  nation.  The  resultant 
execution  can  jam  the  communication  network  of  the 
opponent.  In  case  of  defence  communication  network,  the 
proposed  model  can  prove  cost  efficiency  in  contrary  to  the 
cost of other warfare models of the defence. Table III provides 
a description of various preceding attacks. It provides the idea 
of ongoing strategies involved in an attack. 

III.  GENERALIZED MECHANISM OF HALF-DUPLEX ATTACK 

This section illustrates the mechanism of  the proposed attack 
investigating cybersecurity by the processes computed.  

A.  Overview of the proposed attack 
       Security occupies immense attention in future generation 
communication  technologies,  such  as  spectrum  sharing  and 
D2D  communication.  These  technologies  involve  the  self-
monitored network and are less secure due to the involvement 
of relay devices. The FD relays in case of small cells are mostly 
configured to improve the coverage range and correspondingly 
the  throughput  [26].  The  proposed  attack  encompasses  D2D 
communication having device relaying controlled link, assisted 
by the BS configuration wherein attack is posed on the relay 
device. The attack targets downlink exclusively in comparison 
to the FD attacks, aiming at both uplink and downlink. Further, 
the  proposed  attack  is  devoid  of  the  authentication  phase, 
which  reduces  the  chance  of  miss-rate.  Therefore,  it  is 
predicted that the proposed attack employs greater efficacy and 
security  threat,  comparative  to  the  FD  attacks.  Consider  the 
scenario  wherein  𝑛  number  of  D2D  pairs  are  present  in  the 
network, and device-2 is present at the edge of the cell where 
the signal of the BS is not reachable with sufficient strength. 
The  device-1  is  present  adjacent  to  the  BS  and  is  also 
approachable  by  the  device-2.  Following  the  device  relaying 
controlled  link  configuration,  device-2  is  able  to  access  the 
communication  via  device-1,  as  shown  in  Fig.1.  Assume  an 
Eavesdropper is present neighboring to device-1 and device-2, 
respectively,  observes  the  communication  continuously  and 
has  sufficient  energy  sources  to  introduce  the  attack.  The 
intruder is known of the location of the valid users present in 
the  communication  network.  The  location  of  the  users  is 
obtained  by  the  Thermal  Pattern  Analysis  (TPA)  technique. 

5 
The user farther from the BS requires more energy in contrary 
to  the  nearby  users.  The  users  are  analyzed  based  on  the 
footprint  of    TPA  [21].  The  user  with  highest  energy 
requirements  is  correspondingly  more  distant  from  the  BS. 
Therefore, more energy is required to transmit the signal from 
BS  to  the  respective  user.  In  Fig  2.  region  1  shows  the  TPA 
with respect to the distance of the user from the base station. 
From  the  parameter  of  distance,  the  path  loss  is  evaluated. 
Correspondingly  the  CSI  is  investigated  by  the  inspection  of 
path loss analysis. The comparison is made between the CSI of 
each  user  present  in  the  network.  The  user  with  the  most 
degraded CSI is selected for the attack.  

B.  Formulation of the proposed attack 

      The  proposed  mechanism  of  half-duplex  attack  has  the 
objective of minimizing the miss rate probability 𝑃(𝑚𝑟) and to 
maximize the effectiveness 𝐴𝑝 of the attack shown as:  

𝐴𝑝 =

1
min{𝑃(𝑚𝑟)}

                                (29) 

The  attack  can  be  launched  by  evaluating  the  following 
processes, as shown in Fig 1.(a), 1(b), 1(c) while considering 
transmission time intervals for RRC (Radio Resource Control) 
setup configuration, as shown in Fig. 3. 
1)  Process of ping packet transmission 

      In our formulation, this process of an attack aims to make 
the relay device-1 inaccessible to the BS during the downlink. 
During  the  phase  of  uplink,  authentication  takes  place  by 
device-1  at  the  BS.  It  is  followed  by  the  continuous 
transmission of ping packets by an intruder at the relay device-
1.  Generally,  ping  packets  (request-response)  are  used  to 
determine  the  connectivity  between  the  transmitter  and  the 
receiver. The continuous transmission of ping packet requests 
by  an  attacker  to  the  relay  device-1  results  with  an  equal 
number  of  ping  reply  packets  along  with  the  identification 
number  and  the  sequence  number  from  the  device  to  the 
intruder. The procedure of ping request and ping reply with ID 
number provides the chance to spoof the identity of the target

user.  The  continuous  procedure  of  ping  flood  leads  to  the 
overload  of  network  connectivity  and  inefficient  drain  of 
resources.  This  process  of  attack  targets  the  availability 
parameter of the security and makes the device-1 unavailable 
for  the  downlink  of  BS.  The  process  of  Game  Theory  [22] 
scheme can also be incorporated to spoof the ID of the valid 
user. The process flow of ping packet reception for timestamp 
𝑡𝑛 is expressed as follows: 

′ + 𝑛𝑛)

𝑛
𝑍𝑛 = ∑ (𝐾𝑒𝑣1𝑟𝑖

                     (30) 
Where  𝑍𝑛  is  the  summation  of  𝑛  received  ping  requests  by 
device-1. 𝑛𝑛 is the AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) 
with  zero  mean  and  𝜐2  variance  𝑛𝑛~ℕ(0, 𝜐2),  𝑟′  is  the 
transmitted  ping  by  the  intruder,  𝐾𝑒𝑣1  depicts  the  channel 
coefficients 
the  device-1.  The 
synchronization  of  the  intruder  with  the  BS  and  its  users  is 
achieved by the mechanism of TPA [21] while examining the 
BS and its users in idle and active mode. The energy required 
for the idle mode is comparatively less as compared to that of 
the  active  mode.  Therefore  following  the  footprints  of  the 
thermal energy patterns of the user, the intruder achieves the 
synchronization.  The  idle  mode  and  active  mode  reference 
signal mechanism in view of energy requirements is defined by 
ultra lean design [23], [24].

2)  Process of resource spoofing 

      The primary purpose of the proposed attack is the spoofing 
of resources with reduced miss rates. This process involves the 
successful reception of downlink by the  intruder, transmitted 
by the BS. The procedure is employed by masquerading the ID 
of  device-1  by  the  intruder  such  that  the  resource  allocated 
meant  to  be  transmitted  by  the  BS  to  the  valid  device  is 
received by the intruder. Thus, instead of targeting both uplink 
(authentication phase), solely downlink is targeted. From Fig. 
3 at Transmission Time Interval (TTI) 𝑡1, RRC setup request is 
transmitted  by  the  device-1  to  gNB  for  the  completion  of 
authentication.  The  TTI  𝑡1  is  followed  by  the  𝑡2, 𝑡3, 𝑡4, … , 𝑡𝑛 
Where  the  process  of  ping  flood  takes  place  up  to  𝑛  time 
intervals, as shown in equations (30). Due to which intruder can 
conceal its identity with the identity of valid device-1 for 𝑡𝑛+1 
timestamp.  At  TTI  𝑡𝑛+1,  downlink  from  gNB,  RRC  setup 
response is transmitted to the intruder instead of valid device-
1,  such  that  intruder  RRC-IDLE  obtains  the  intruder  RRC 
time 
connected  state,  as  shown 

in  Fig.  3.  During 

6 
stamp 𝑡𝑛+2 , 𝑡𝑛+3  the random sequence is transmitted to device-
2,  and  an  RRC  setup  completion  acknowledgment  is  sent  to 
gNB.  For  the  case  of  a  connection  failure  mechanism,  an 
intruder  fails  in  achieving  the  connected  state.  The  intruder 
continuously  repeats  the  process  from  the  TTI  𝑡2  until 
connected RRC state is achieved.  

3)  Process of Artificial Noise (AN) intrusion 
      The AN is transmitted by the intruder to the device-2 during  
the transmission of an information-bearing signal from device-
1  to  device-2  at  the  time  stamp  𝑡𝑛+2.  The  intruder  acts  as  a 
jammer to interfere in the signals between device-1 and device-
2.  The  device-2,  consequently,  attempts  to  decode  the 
interfered  signal.  The  purpose  of  incurring  artificial  noise  at 
device-2 is to prevent the request signal back to BS from the 
device-2. Where  AN can be  a randomly  generated  sequence. 
The received signal at the device-2 with artificial noise can be 
given as: 

𝑍2 = 𝐾12𝑦1 + 𝐾𝑒𝑣2𝑁𝑒𝑣 + 𝑛𝑡𝑛+2                 (31) 
The  formulated  attack  aggregates  the  process  over  multiple 
time intervals. For a range of challenging capability of attacks, 
a  HD  attack  exhibits  greater  strength  to  evolve  the  attack 
successfully.  The  analysis  of  the  probability  of  a  successful 
attack can be explained in the next section. 
C.  Impact on miss-rate probability 
      In Fig. 3. RRC (Radio Resource Control) setup executing 
half-duplex  scenario  is  represented.  The  downlink  reception 
from BS  for the timestamp 𝑡𝑛+1 involves two possibilities. The 
first possibility includes the successful reception of downlink 
RRC setup by the legitimate device-1, denotes failure as 𝑚𝐷𝐿 
while  as  the  second  possibility  involves  the  successful 
reception  of  downlink  RRC  setup  by  an  intruder,  depicting 
success  as  𝑏𝐷𝐿  The  corresponding  probabilities  of  missed 
attempts  and  successful  attempts  define  the  probability  of 
missed attempts and the probability of successful attempts of 
the HD attack. Let 𝑍[𝑡𝑖] for 𝑖 = 1,2,3, … 𝑛, 𝑛 + 1, 𝑛 + 2, … and 
𝑛 = 1,2,3, … defines a Bernoulli process using parameter 𝑚𝐷𝐿. 
If 𝑍[𝑡1], 𝑍[𝑡2], 𝑍[𝑡3], … , 𝑍[𝑡𝑖] are Independent and Identically 
Distributed  (I.I.D.) random  variables  such  that  the  process  is 
defined as a discrete random process whose density function is 
expressed as: 
 𝑓𝑍𝑡𝑖
Where 𝛿( . ) depicts the unit impulse function. At the intruder, 
for the half-duplex attack, the sum of the Bernoulli processes 
can be obtained as: 

[𝑡𝑖]) = 𝑏𝐷𝐿𝛿(𝑧𝑖[𝑡𝑖]) + 𝑚𝐷𝐿𝛿(𝑧𝑡𝑖

[𝑡𝑖] − 1)       (32) 

[𝑡𝑖](𝑧𝑡𝑖

𝑆(𝑧𝑡𝑖

[𝑡1] + 𝑧𝑡2

[𝑡2] + 𝑧𝑡3

[𝑡𝑖] = 𝑢) =   𝑧𝑡1

[𝑡3] + ⋯ + 𝑧𝑡𝑖[𝑡𝑖]    (33) 
The  probability  of  successful  reception  of  downlink  by  the 
device-1  during  a  half-duplex  attack  or  the  probability  of 
missed  attempt  can  be  obtained  by  using  equation  (33)  such 
that  the  sum  of  the  Bernoulli  processes  defines  the  binomial 
process.

𝑖−𝑢              (35) 

For FD attack, the involvement of uplink and downlink takes 
place such that the missed attempts can be evaluated for both 
uplink  and  downlink.  The  probability  of  missed  attempts 
defines miss rate probability. The corresponding probabilities 
of  missed  attempts  for  uplink  and  downlink  in  FD  attack  is 
given by: 

7 

𝑃(𝑆(𝑧𝑖[𝑡𝑖] = 𝑢))𝐹𝐷 = ( 𝑖

𝑢)𝑚𝐹𝐷

𝑢  𝑏𝐹𝐷

𝑖−𝑢              (36) 

Let  the  probability  of  missed  attempts  in  half-duplex  and 
probability of missed attempts in the downlink of FD attack are 
equal such that: 

𝑃(𝑆(𝑧𝑖[𝑡𝑖] = 𝑢))𝐻𝐷 ≤ 𝑃(𝑆(𝑧𝑖[𝑡𝑖] = 𝑢))𝐹𝐷       (37) 
The  equation  (37)  indicates  that  the  miss  rate  probability  of 
accessing  resource  allocation  in  a  HD  attack  is  less  than  the 
miss rate probability achieved in the FD attack. However, the 
probabilities of missed attempts in HD attack and FD attack can 
be equal for zero probability of missed attempts during uplink 
in the FD attack. (See Lemma 2)                     
Corollary 1: The miss-rate achieved for the HD attack (mr)HD 
on device-1 by an intruder is less than or equal to miss rate of 
intruder achieved in the FD attack (mr)FD.  

(mr)HD ≤ (mr)FD                            (38) 

The proof of the corollary 1 is shown in the appendix. 

D.  Case of mobile user 
     In case of the mobile user, the intruder manages to achieve 
the impact of AR by executing the AR over a large area. AR 
lies  in  the  range  of  0.5Kms  [25].  The  next  generation 
communication  incorporates  small  cell  radius  occupies  the 
same range as of the AR coverage. The procedure of the AR 
covers the area of the mobile user. In other words, the range of 
the  area  in  which  mobile  user  roams  in  a  particular  cell  is 
covered by the AR. It is illustrated by the Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, the 
initial  position  of  the  mobile  user  lies  at  𝑥 = 0.  The  user  is 
moving with a velocity 𝑣. The area of communication in which 
the user is moving is covered by the AR such that the intruder 
attacks on the mobile user at 𝑥 = 𝑑. However, to prevent or to 
reduce  the  impact  of  AR  on  the  intruder,  it  is  present  at  the 
boundary of the area covered by the AR. The attack is initiated 
by the intruder on the target user either at the (𝑡 = 0 + +, 𝑥 =
0 + +) or less than (𝑡 = 𝑇, 𝑥 = 𝑑). It is due the fact that the 
intensity  of  the  AR  is  moderate  or  less  than  the  predefined 
value  of  the  AR  at  (𝑡 = 0 + +, 𝑥 = 0)  or  at  (𝑡 = 𝑇, 𝑥 = 𝑑), 
𝑑 ≤ 0.5𝑘𝑚𝑠. Therefore,  even  in  case  of  mobile  user  the  AR 
impact will be observed in the cell coverage area. Also, UAVs 
(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) can prove an effective choice to 
attain the precision of the AR on a specific area. 

IV.  HALF DUPLEX ATTACK: AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE 

         This  section  demonstrates  the  equipped  strategy  of  the 
proposal. Fig.5. depicts the comparative performance analysis 
in  presence  and  in  the  absence  of  an  intruder.  Real-Time 
random  deployment  of  the  users  is  considered  in  view  of 
cybersecurity  wherein  setup  of  FD  and  HD  attacks  are 

Fig. 4. Impact of AR on mobile user 

observed.  Based  on  the  channel  modeling,  channel  gain 
assigned to different users under the inspection of the path loss 
model [16]. The distance of the user from the BS is denoted at 
the top of each bar. 

A.  Intruder attack on User-3 in an urban scenario 
       From the Fig.5(a), it is observed that the users are deployed 
under  the  random  scenario,  in  which  user  3  occupies  the 
farthest  distance  (223m)  from  the  BS  and  thus  experiences 
maximum  path  loss  as  depicted  in  equation  (15).  More  the 
distance  of  the  user  from  the  BS  more  is  the  path  loss. 
Therefore, the user-3 occupies minimum gain associated with 
the BS. Thus, it is observed as the prime target for the attack. 
The  intruder  follows  the  scanning  procedure  for  spoofing  by 
the intruder. The performance of the user-3 is degraded by the 
presence of the AR. Under the implementation of the AR, it is 
perceived  that  chance  of  intruding  the  attack  on  the  user  3 
increases.  Also,  from  Fig. 5(c), the degraded performance  of 
the  user-3  due  to  AR  can  be  compared  with  the  achieved 
performance of the user-2 of a similar distance.  

B.  Intruder sensitivity in FD and HD in an urban scenario 
       From Fig. 5(a) and 5(b),  under the phenomenon of HD and 
FD spoofing attack in urban, HD attack is detected to be more 
sensitive in comparison to the FD attack. According to Wyner’s 
theory  of  wiretap  channels,  the  security  of  information  is 
attained if the quality of the main channel is greater than the 
quality of the wiretap channel. Following the phenomenon of 
AR,  the  quality  of  the  channel  of  user-3  is  degraded,  which 
enhances  the  chance  of  the  intruder  to  spoof  successfully. 
Therefore, the optimal quality for the wiretap channel, required 
for  the  attack  which  is  given  as  𝐶𝑒𝑣 > 𝐶𝑢.  Thus  the  optimal 
value  to  spoof  the  resources  from  the  valid  user  is  the  just 
higher value than 𝐶𝑢.The more optimal value is attained by HD 
attack, just above the throughput of the user-3,  enables  more 
sensitivity as compared to the sensitivity provided by the FD 
attack. 
C.  Impact of AR in the urban and rural scenario 
       From Fig. 5(b) and 5(d), the observed throughput under the 
execution of attack in the presence of AR, is less in the urban 
scenario  than  in  the  rural  scenario.  In  other  words,  it  depicts 
that the impact of AR is more significant in the urban scenario

for the evaluation. 
B.  Result analysis 
     A comparative analysis is made between the rural and urban 
scenarios in the presence and absence of the artificial rain while 
executing  HD  attack  and  FD  attack.  Fig.  6.  demonstrates 
secrecy  rate  analysis  of  the  valid  user  with  respect  to  the 
distance in rural and urban scenarios under the execution of AR 
at  an  operating  frequency  of  28  GHz.  It  is  illustrated  in  the 
figure, the secrecy rate achieved in urban scenarios under the 
influence  of  AR  decreases  rapidly  with  an  approximation  of 
4.94  GHz.  Also,  in  the  case  of  a  rural  scenario,  the  overall 
difference  of  the  secrecy  rate  in  the  presence  of  the  AR  is 
approximated as 0.95 Gbps. It defines that the impact of AR is 
thoroughly  observed  in  an  urban  scenario  than  in  a  rural 
scenario. However, the relative difference of the secrecy rate in 
the  presence  of  AR  is  identified  as  4.29  Gbps  in  the  urban 
scenario and 9.48 Gbps in the rural scenario from the distance 
of 10m to 250m. In addition to it, the relative difference in the 
secrecy  rate  of  rural  scenario  is  8.58  Gbps,  and  in  the  urban 
scenario is of the range of 6.58 Gbps from the distance of 10m 
to 250m in the absence of AR, which is comparatively lower in 
urban  than  in  rural  scenario.  Therefore,  from  the  above 
analysis,  it  is  concluded  that  the  urban  scenario  executes  a 
drastic  decrease  in  secrecy  rate  than  in  rural  scenario  for  a 
distance of 10m to 250m in the presence of AR. 
Fig.  7.  shows  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  user  at  different 
distances from the BS. A steep decreasing slope is observed for

than in rural scenarios. Therefore, it can be concluded that the 
urban scenario is more prone to security attacks as compared to 
the rural scenario by using AR.  

D.  Intruder sensitivity in FD and HD in an urban scenario 
      A similar justification is followed in the rural scenario as 
given for urban scenarios. However, the observed impact of the 
attack  is  comparatively  less  significant  in  the  rural  scenario 
than  in  urban  scenarios  at  the  user-3  deployed  at  the  same 
distance from BS.  
E.  Intruder attack on User-3 in the rural scenario 
      From Fig. 5(c) the user-3 present at the extreme end of the 
cell  at  a  distance  223m  and  the  user-2  present  at  a  similar 
distance of 215m from BS. Though similar channel conditions 
are expected to be obtained for both the users, nonetheless, the 
impact  of  AR  and  attack  decreases  the  throughput  of  user-3. 
Comparing the rural and urban scenarios, the rural scenario is 
concluded  to  be  more  optimal  as  far  as  the  security  of  the 
network is concerned in the presence of AR. 

V.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

In this section, the results of the simulation are examined and 
discussed  systematically.  For  investigating  the  results,  urban 
scenarios and rural scenarios under the microcell deployment 
are taken into the assessment. The security analysis is evaluated 
based on the performance of the valid user in the presence of 
an intruder executing an HD attack. This section is categorized 
into three main segments. The setup analysis is specified in the 
first  segment.  The  second  segment    examines  the  security 
analysis and performance analysis in the presence of AR. The 
last segment summarizes the analysis in brief.  
A.  Simulation setup 
      The scenario of the proposed schematic and the analysis on 
different  parameters  are  carried  out  in  MATLAB  computing 

 
frequencies, 

for  different 

 the  urban  scenario,  with  a  huge  difference  of  135.39  Gbps 
decrease  due  to  the  presence  of  AR.  For  the  rural  scenario, 
close proximity is observed between the presence of the effect 
of AR and in the absence of the AR with a factor of 47.97 Gbps 
in contrary to the urban scenario. 
From Fig. 8. secrecy rate analysis is witnessed under the impact 
including  mmWave 
of  AR 
frequencies.  The  results  are  performed  under  the  distance  of 
100m  of  the  user  from  the  BS.  An  exponential  decrease  of 
secrecy rate is observed with an increase in the frequency. For 
rural  and  urban  scenarios,  rural  scenario  occupies  a  more 
secrecy  rate  as  compared  to  the  secrecy  rate  achieved  in  an 
urban scenario with respect to the increase in frequency. In the 
presence of AR, the rural scenario is observed to have a drastic 
impact of AR on the achieved secrecy rate than the secrecy rate 
achieved  in  the  case  of  an  urban  scenario.  From  the  above 
analysis, it is evaluated that with an increase in frequency, the 
secrecy  rate  tends  to  decrease  exponentially,  and  in  the 
presence of AR, the secrecy rate in the rural scenario has a more 
significant impact.  
Fig.  9.  shows  the  energy  efficiency  for  millimeter-wave 
frequencies  in  the  urban  and  rural  scenarios.  A  decreasing 
exponential characteristic of the energy efficiency is depicted 
for the urban scenario for an increase in frequency. However, 
better performance of energy efficiency is observed in the rural 
scenario than in urban scenarios. Under the analysis of AR, a 
rural  scenario  provides  relatively  less  difference  in  the 
performance  of  energy  efficiency  than  energy  efficiency 
achieved  in  an  urban  scenario.  In  other  words,  the  urban 
scenario  has  a  greater  impact  of  AR  on  the  performance  of 
energy efficiency with respect to the frequency. 
Fig. 10 represents a miss rate for HD and FD attack under AR 
impact with respect to the number of attempts. It is determined 
from  the  graphical  analysis,  that  a  linearly  increasing 
characteristic is shown between the number of attempts and the 
miss-rate. However, the proposed approach of  the  HD attack 
specifies  lower  miss-rate  than  the  FD  attack.  The  graph  also 
represents the detail, with an increase in several attempts, the 
difference  between  miss-rate  of  HD  and  FD  progressively 
increases.  
Fig.  11.  signifies  the  probability  of  missed  attempts  with 
respect  to  the  number  of  exactly  occurring  missed  attempts. 
The probabilities are obtained based on the Binomial (special 
case-Bernoulli)  distribution  and  are  compared  with  the 
probabilities  achieved  from  the  Poisons  discrete  distribution. 
The simulation is performed under AR in the communication 
network.  The  graph  incorporates  bell-curve  characteristics  in 
which HD attack possesses a lower probability of the miss-rate 
attempts as compared to the probability of miss rate attempts 
obtained  in  the  FD  attack.  It  is  apparent  from  the  graph  that 
Binomial distribution provides a higher probability of missed 
attempts than the probability obtained from the distribution of 
the poison. Therefore, it can be concluded that the HD attack 
provides  fewer  chances  of  miss-attempts  of  attack.  The 
obtained  result  motivates  the  enactment  of  the  proposed

C.  Summary of the observations and restrictions 

      The  HD  based  attack  is  designed  for  detection  of  the 
possible  security  menace  to  the  users,  significantly  operated 
under the impact of AR to determine the security of the users 
in  the  rural  and  urban  scenario.  The  executed  approach 
simultaneously analyses the influence of AR, followed by the 
HD  attack.  The  purpose  of  introducing  AR  is  to  worsen  the 
secrecy  rate  of  the  valid  user.  At  a  particular  distance,  it  is 
observed that the  urban scenario has a greater impact of AR. 
However, under the relative difference of the secrecy rate for a 
range of distance 10m to 250m from the BS, the rural scenario 
undergoes  greater  deterioration  in  the  secrecy  rate.  The 
observed results confirm that the performance of the HD attack 
is  several  times  effective  than  that  of  the  FD  attack  via  the 
examination of the miss-rate. As a significance of which, the 
attacking  capability  of  the  proposed  attack  poses  a  greater 
threat.  Moreover,  under  the  framework  of  rural  and  urban 
scenario,  the  performance  of  the  attack  in  a  rural  scenario  is 
proved to be more efficient in terms of sensitivity, and energy 
efficiency.  

Additionally,  the  proposed  framework  occupies  a  minimum 
radiation aspect with a reachable resilient signal strength for a 
distance  of  120m  from  BS.  However,  for  a  macrocell  radius 
greater  than  250m,  the  transmission  power  is  required  to  be 
approximated  to  23dbm  to  43dbm,  though  it  results  in  an 
upsurge of interference and complexity. 

VI.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  

is 

focus 

       In  this  paper,  the  security  perspective  of  the  rain 
attenuation  is  taken  into  consideration  for  the  wireless 
communication  network.  The  prime 
the 
the  HD  attack  model  with  better 
implementation  of 
performance as compared to the conventional attacks for both 
rural and urban scenarios. The framework of the attack broadly 
consists of two parts. The first part defines the execution of the 
AR by the attacker to decrease the secrecy rate of the valid user. 
The second part involves the implementation of an HD attack. 
The  parameter  of  distance  is  taken  into  concern  for  the 
evaluation of the security parameters. Furthermore, an analysis 
is  performed  on  the  mmWave  frequencies  in  the  rural  and

missed attempts from a total number of attempts 

from the BS is denoted at the top of each bar, respectively. The 
assessed results show that more distances of the user from the 
BS decreases the sensitivity, and thus decreases the probability 
of  attaining  an  optimum  value  of  capacity  required  by  the 
attacker to decrease the secrecy capacity of the valid user below 
the threshold. Furthermore, it is also reflected in Fig. 12 that 
HD  attack  provides  more  sensitivity  than  an  FD  attack.  The 
variation of sensitivity in FD and HD is considerably higher in 
the rural scenario than the variation of sensitivity for HD and 
FD attack in an urban scenario.  

 
urban scenarios under the influence of AR. The attained results 
have  emphasized  that  the  proposed  approach  of  HD  attack 
proves  to  be  more  effectual  in  terms  of  miss-rate,  and 
sensitivity.  
In  future  work,  the  accuracy  of  the  proposed  attack  can  be 
increased  by  optimizing  the  required  capacity  to  execute  the 
attack. Also, proficient mechanisms of AR can be initiated to 
improve  the  cost  efficiency  and  accuracy.  Additionally,  the 
proposed  approach  can  be  extended  for  testing  of  UAV 
(Unmanned  Ariel  Vehicle)  application  and  can  prove 
advantageous  in  border  areas  of  defense  to  spoof  the 
information from the opponent. 

APPENDIX 

Lemma 1: The secrecy capacity of the user is reduced due to 
the  AR  attenuation  introduced  by  the  intruder,  and  the 
corresponding  SNR  gets  deteriorated.  The  sum  of  secrecy 
capacity  required  to  decrease  the  secrecy  capacity  below 
threshold capacity can be obtained by AR attenuation given by:  
(𝐶𝑠)𝐴𝑅 = 𝐶𝑢 − (𝐶𝑒𝑣)𝐴𝑅 < 𝐶𝑇                   (39) 
Thus,                                𝐶𝑠 > (𝐶𝑠)𝐴𝑅                                 (40) 
Proof: Consider a scenario in which path loss 𝑃𝑙 (𝑑𝑏) is obtained 
in the absence of an intruder given by: 

𝑃𝑙 (𝑑𝑏) = 𝑃𝑡 (𝑑𝑏) − 𝑃𝑟 (𝑑𝑏)                    (41) 

SNR can also be obtained as: 

(𝜍)𝑑𝐵 = 𝑃𝑡 (𝑑𝑏) − 𝑃𝑙 (𝑑𝑏) − 𝛾′               (42) 

The secrecy capacity is given by: 

𝐶𝑠 = 𝐶𝑢 − 𝐶𝑒𝑣                            (43) 

In the absence of eavesdropper 𝐶𝑒𝑣 ≈ 0 

𝐶𝑠 = 𝐶𝑢 
  𝐶𝑠 = log2(1 + 𝜍)                      (44) 
For  the  scenario  in  the  presence  of  an  intruder  incorporating 
AR. Let 𝜛 be the attenuation created by AR. The path loss for 
this scenario is given by: 

𝑃′

𝑙 (𝑑𝑏) = 𝑃𝑡 (𝑑𝑏) − 𝑃𝑟 (𝑑𝑏) − (𝜛)𝐴𝑅           (45) 

The equation of SNR can be expressed as: 

(𝜍 𝐴𝑅)𝑑𝐵 = 𝑃𝑡 (𝑑𝑏) − 𝑃𝑙 (𝑑𝑏) − (𝜛)𝐴𝑅 − 𝛾′      (46) 

Comparing equation (42) and equation (46), we get: 

(𝜍 𝐴𝑅)𝑑𝐵 = (𝜍)𝑑𝐵 − (𝜛)𝐴𝑅                 (47) 
Equation (47) indicates (𝜍)𝑑𝐵 > (𝜍 𝐴𝑅)𝑑𝐵. From equation (12) 
the capacity of the user is proportional to the SNR. Therefore, 
the  corresponding  secrecy  capacities  of  SNR  obtained  in  the 
presence  of  eavesdropper  under 
the  procedure  of  AR 
attenuation is given by: 

(𝐶𝑠)𝐴𝑅 = 𝐶𝑢 − (𝐶𝑒𝑣)𝐴𝑅                    (48) 
Substituting  the  value  of  𝐶𝑢  from  equation  (44)  in  equation 
(48), we get: 

(𝐶𝑠)𝐴𝑅 = 𝐶𝑠 − (𝐶𝑒𝑣)𝐴𝑅                        (49) 
From  equation  (49),  it  is  observed  that  (𝐶𝑠)𝐴𝑅  is  a  smaller 
quantity than 𝐶𝑠, therefore, we conclude that  

(𝐶𝑠)𝐴𝑅 < 𝐶𝑠                                  (50) 
Let the amount of attenuation is created in such a manner such 
that the secrecy capacity reduces below the threshold given by: 

11 
(𝐶𝑠)𝐴𝑅 = 𝐶𝑠 − (𝐶𝑒𝑣)𝐴𝑅   < 𝐶𝑇                (51) 
Or                           (𝐶𝑠)𝐴𝑅 = 𝐶𝑢 − (𝐶𝑒𝑣)𝐴𝑅 < 𝐶𝑇                (52) 
Equation (52) proves the proposed lemma 
The expression obtained from equation (52) indicates that the 
achieved secrecy capacity can be decreased by the attenuation 
of  AR.  Thereby,  it  can  act  as  the  performance  limiting 
parameter.  The  illustration  for  the  obtained  results  based  on 
equation (52) is given in Fig. 6. and Fig.8.  
Lemma 2: The probability of a miss rate for the HD attack is 
less  than  the  probability  of  a  miss  rate  for  the  FD  attack. 
However, the miss rate probability can be equal for HD attack 
and FD attack for zero miss rate probability in the uplink 

𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷 ≤ 𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷                         (53) 
Proof:    Let  𝐽  and  𝐾  define  the  miss  rates  for  uplink  and 
downlink, respectively. The HD attack involves the attack on 
downlink only. Therefore, the miss rate probability for the half-
duplex attack is given by: 

𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷 = 𝑃(𝐾)                               (54) 

The miss rate probability for FD attack can be given as: 

𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 = 𝑃(𝐽 + 𝐾)                                (55) 
= 𝑃(𝐽) + 𝑃(𝐾) − 𝑃(𝐽 ∩ 𝐾)      (56) 
The  events  𝐽  and  𝐾  are  mutually  exclusive  and  are  I.I.D. 
therefore,                         𝑃(𝐽 ∩ 𝐾) = 0                               (57) 
Equation (56) becomes  

𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 = 𝑃(𝐽) + 𝑃(𝐾)                         (58) 

Using equation (54) 

𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 = 𝑃(𝐽) + 𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷                   (59) 
For  minimum  miss  rate  probability  in  the  uplink,  such  that 
𝑃(𝐽) ≈ 0 equation (59) can be given as : 

𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 = 𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷    ∀   𝑃(𝐽) ≈ 0                (60) 
However,  probability  cannot  be  negative,  for  miss  rate 
probability  in  uplink  greater  than  zero.  Equation  (59)  can  be 
obtained as: 

𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 > 𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷     ∀   𝑃(𝐽) > 0               (61) 

Combining equation (60) and (61) we get: 

𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 ≥ 𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷    ∀   𝑃(𝐽) ≥ 0 
Or               𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷 ≤ 𝑃(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 ∀   𝑃(𝐽) ≥ 0                 (62) 
Equation  (62)  proves  the  stated  lemma  and  derives  the 
condition that the probability of the miss rate of the attacking 
attempts for HD attack cannot be greater than the  FD attack. 
The illustration of the achieved expression is depicted in Fig. 
11.  
Corollary 1: The miss-rate achieved for the HD attack (mr)HD 
on device-1 by an intruder is less than or equal to miss rate of 
intruder achieved in the FD attack (mr)FD.  

(𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷 ≤ (𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 
Proof: Consider 𝑥 as the total number of attempts made by the 
intruder and 𝑚 number of missed attempts to access resource 
allocation in HD attack such that miss rate for HD attack can 
be expressed as: 

𝑚

(𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷 =

                                  (63) 
For  FD  attack,  let  𝑚1and  𝑚2  denotes  the  number  of  missed 
attempts  in  uplink  and  downlink,  respectively.  The  miss  rate 
for FD can be given as: 

𝑥

 
(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 =

                          (65) 

For HD attack, the number of missed attempts are defined for 
downlink only. Let the number of missed attempts in HD be an 
equal number of missed attempts in  the downlink for the  FD 
attack. Equation (64) can be re-written as: 

𝑚

𝑚1
𝑥

(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 =
 Comparing equation (63) and equation (66), we get 

+

𝑥

                             (66) 

(𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷 = (𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷 +

𝑚1
𝑥

                      (67) 

  is  non-negative  quantity  and  lies  between  0  to  𝑛. 

Where 

𝑚1
𝑥

Therefore,  

(𝑚𝑟)𝐻𝐷 ≤ (𝑚𝑟)𝐹𝐷      ∀ 

𝑚1
𝑥

≥ 0                 (68) 

Equation (68) proves the miss rate in HD attack is less than the 
miss-rate  observed  in  the  FD  attack  for  an  equal  number  of 
missed  attempts  in  respective  downlinks.  However,  for  zero 
missed attempts in the uplink of the FD attack, the miss rate for 
the  FD  attack,  in  that  case,  is  equal  to  the  miss  rate  in  HD 
attack.
