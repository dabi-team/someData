The DEAP-3600 experiment is searching for WIMP dark matter with a 3.3 tonne single phase
liquid argon (LAr) target, located 2.1 km underground at SNOLAB. The experimental signature of
dark matter interactions is keV-scale 40Ar nuclear recoils (NR) producing 128 nm LAr scintillation
photons observed by PMTs. The largest backgrounds in DEAP-3600 are electronic recoils (ER)
induced by β and γ-rays originating from internal and external radioactivity in the detector material.
A background model of the ER interactions in DEAP-3600 was developed and is described in this
work. The model is based on several components which are expected from radioisotopes in the LAr,
from ex-situ material assay measurements, and from dedicated independent in-situ analyses. This
prior information is used in a Bayesian ﬁt of the ER components to a 247.2 d dataset to model the
radioactivity in the surrounding detector materials.

While excellent discrimination between ERs and NRs is reached with pulse shape discrimina-
tion, detailed knowledge of the ER background and activity of detector components, sets valuable
constraints on other key types of backgrounds in the detector: neutrons and alphas.

In addition, the activity of 42Ar in LAr in DEAP-3600 is determined by measuring the daughter
decay of 42K. This cosmogenically activated trace isotope is a relevant background at higher energies
for other rare event searches using atmospheric argon e.g. DarkSide-20k, GERDA or LEGEND. The
speciﬁc activity of 42Ar in the atmosphere is found to be 40.4 ± 5.9 µBq/kg of argon.

INTRODUCTION

Strong evidence suggests dark matter accounts for
84.5% of the matter and 26.8% of the total energy den-
sity in the universe [1]. Weakly interacting massive par-
ticles (WIMPs) are a favored candidate for particle-like
dark matter and can be searched for with direct detection
via elastic nuclear scattering on target materials in low-
background experiments. DEAP-3600 is searching for
WIMP dark matter with a 3.3 tonne single phase liquid
argon (LAr) target, 2070 m underground (6000 meters
water equivalent ﬂat overburden) at SNOLAB in Sud-
bury, Canada. The muon ﬂux at this depth is reduced
by about 8 orders of magnitude compared to sea level [2].
DEAP-3600 is described in detail in [3]. It consists of a
spherical acrylic vessel (AV) which holds the target liquid
argon. The spherical volume is ﬁlled to approximately
30 cm from the top. The inside of the acrylic vessel is
coated with a 3 µm-thick layer of 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-
butadiene (TPB) which converts argon scintillation light
to the visible region (∼420 nm). 255 Hamamatsu R5912
high quantum eﬃciency photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)
view the LAr volume via 19-cm diameter light guides
(LGs) which are bonded to the vessel. The space be-
tween the light guides is ﬁlled with blocks of alternating
layers of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and Styro-
foam. These ﬁller blocks (FBs) provide neutron shield-
ing and thermal insulation. The detector is in a spherical
3.4 m-diameter stainless steel shell which is immersed in a
cylindrical water tank of 7.8 m height and diameter. The
data acquisition, built in the MIDAS [4] framework, is
triggered and reads out individual PMT waveforms with
single photoelectron sensitivity. A cross-sectional view of
components relevant to this work is given in Fig. 6.

DEAP-3600 detects LAr scintillation light from parti-
cle interactions and separates electronic recoil (ER) back-
grounds from nuclear recoil (NR) WIMP-like events us-
ing pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) [5]. In this work,
we use the PSD parameter Fprompt, deﬁned as the ra-
tio of the prompt light to the total light intensity of an
event. We use a prompt window 150 ns in length and a
total event window of 10 us. This window is identical to
the analysis in [6] and is more appropriate for the high
energy events studied in this work than the shorter win-
dow recently used in [7]. The light intensity is measured
in photo electrons (PE) detected across the PMT array.
The number of PE in each pulse is determined by divid-
ing the pulse charge by the mean charge of a single PE
in the PMT [8].

NRs dominantly cause the creation of the singlet state
of the argon dimer molecule, which decays in 6−7 ns. The
ER events dominantly yield excited dimers in the triplet
state which decay with a time constant of approximately
1.4 µs. Thus, NR events have an average Fprompt value
of approximately 0.7 while ER events have an average
Fprompt value of approximately 0.28.

For the purpose of this analysis, ER refers to events
caused by electromagnetic interactions in the argon, in-

2

cluding the passage of fast electrons from β-decay and
from γ-ray interactions such as pair production, Comp-
ton scattering, and the photoelectric eﬀect. Muon tracks
in the liquid argon are rare, result in very large signals
and are not considered here. Cherenkov radiation can be
produced by the same ER interactions relevant for this
work but is vastly subdominant compared to the scin-
tillation signals at the considered energies, and is thus
ignored.

The argon target used in DEAP is sourced from the
earth’s atmosphere and contains three stable isotopes:
40Ar (99.60%), 38Ar (0.06%) and 36Ar (0.33%), where
values in parenthesis denote the isotopic abundances [9].
In the even-even nucleus 36Ar a single electron capture
is energetically forbidden but a decay via double elec-
tron capture - a second-order process similar to dou-
ble β-decay - can occur. Currently, the best limit on
the half-life for the neutrinoless decay mode in 36Ar is
T1/2> 3.6 × 1021 yr (90% credibility interval) [10].

The argon target also contains three unstable but long-
42Ar (T1/2=32.9 ± 1.1 yr),
lived cosmogenic isotopes:
39Ar (T1/2=269 ± 3 yr) and 37Ar (T1/2=35.04 ± 0.4 d).
The vast majority of events in DEAP-3600 are ERs
from the β-decay of 39Ar, intrinsic to atmospheric argon
with a measured speciﬁc activity of 1.01 ± 0.02(stat) ±
0.08(syst) Bq/kg (WARP collaboration [11]) and 0.95 ±
0.05 Bq/kg (ArDM collaboration [12]). 39Ar dominates
the ER background by approximately a factor of 100 up
until its endpoint at 565±5 keV. The β-decay of 42Ar and
its daughter 42K have approximately 4 orders of magni-
tude less speciﬁc activity than 39Ar and its precise con-
centration in atmospheric argon is not well determined
[13–16]. Especially the daughter decay of 42K is a dom-
inant background in neutrinoless double beta decay ex-
periments using argon as shielding such as GERDA and
LEGEND. A dedicated analysis of the 42Ar activity in at-
mospheric argon is presented in this work. The electron
capture of 37Ar has a relatively short half-life compared
to experimental time scales and only emits X-rays up to
2.8 keV. It is not considered in this work.

The main direct backgrounds for the WIMP search are
(1) α-decays on the surface of the detector in which only
a fraction of their energy is deposited in scintillating ma-
terial, (2) neutron interactions, which produce recoiling
argon nuclei similar to WIMP interactions, and (3) ER
events that are misidentiﬁed as NR. DEAP-3600 was de-
signed so that each of these background components ac-
counts for less than 0.2 events in a 3000 kg × yr exposure
after ﬁducialization for the WIMP search [3].

The dominant source of neutron emission in the de-
tector is from (α,n) reactions in the borosilicate glass
of the PMTs. The activity from α-decays in the 238U
and 232Th chains can be constrained by measuring the
γ-rays within the ER background model. In addition, the
overall neutron ﬂux in the surrounding detector material
results in (n,γ) reactions producing γ-rays with energies
up to approximately 10 MeV, which are measured.

In this paper a model is developed for the ER back-

grounds in DEAP-3600 for data collected in the ﬁrst year
of operation. Expected background contributions are ﬁt
to the data in a Bayesian framework, in order to ob-
tain information on the activity or speciﬁc activity of
detector components. In Sec. II the dataset and cuts for
pile-up rejection and data cleaning are explained, along
with the energy calibration of ER events. Sec. III dis-
cusses in detail the components used in the model and
how they were simulated in a Geant4-based [17] Monte
Carlo (MC) simulation framework. The analysis of the
background decomposition is described in Sec. IV. The
results and the validation of the analysis are given in
Sec. V and VI. Finally, Sec. VII discusses a dedicated
analysis of the 42Ar concentration in atmospheric argon,
looking at the contribution of its daughter 42K to the ER
background above the 2614.5 keV γ-line of 208Tl.

II. DATA SELECTION

A. Data Set and Cuts

This paper uses an open data set taken between
November 1, 2016 and October 31, 2017. The lifetime
for physics data taken in that timeframe is 247.2 days
after data quality checks†.

This analysis uses a small set of cuts designed to
remove instrumental artifacts and event pile-up, while
keeping scintillation events with high acceptance and lit-
tle energy- and position-dependence within the detector.
Therefore, ﬁducial volume cuts are not used.

Events are selected under the following conditions. (1)
The trigger is derived from LAr PMTs, excluding muon
veto triggers and pulser events.
(2) A series of low-
level criteria are met: no pile-up between diﬀerent trigger
types, the DAQ was in a ready state, the pulse-ﬁnding al-
gorithm was successful, and events had a stable baseline.
The low-level cuts remove < 0.1% of events. (3) No pile-
up was detected by any of the following pile-up criteria:
a template ﬁt ﬁnds more than one scintillation-like sig-
nal in the recorded event, the reconstructed “time zero”
of an event lies outside a narrow window deﬁned by the
trigger time, the recorded PMT signals before the trigger
time have ≥ 3 PE, and the event occurs less than 20 µs
after the previous event. The pileup cuts reliably remove
pile-up events separated by more than 0.5 µs. With a
trigger rate of 3170 Hz, the detected and removed pile-
up fraction is 5.4%. The fraction of un-detected pile-up
within 0.5 µs is 0.15% and thus negligible. The removed
pile-up fraction is an input to the detection eﬃciency in
the background model on which we assume a conservative
10% systematic uncertainty.

†This paper includes approximately 0.5 days more exposure than [7].
This corresponds to short runs in which the trigger eﬃciency at low
energy was not suﬃciently well determined for WIMP analysis.

FIG. 1. Top: Fprompt vs. PE spectrum of the dataset after
sequence of cuts and before energy calibration. The horizontal
lines illustrate the selected Fprompt region for this work. The
color scale denotes counts per 100 PE and 0.005 Fprompt bin.
Bottom: Selected ER events. The ﬁt functions of the two
prominent background γ-lines at 1460.8 keV from 40K and at
2614.5 keV from 208Tl are shown as well as the mean value.

All selected events in the dataset are shown in a
Fprompt vs. PE plot in the top panel of Fig. 1. A NR
band can be seen at high Fprompt values between 0.6 and
0.8, mainly populated by α-decays. An ER band emerges
at low Fprompt values between 0.2 and 0.4. Below the ER
band is a population of events caused by α-decays in
the gaseous argon above the liquid level, most prominent
between approximately 10000 to 15000 PE. The horizon-
tal dashed lines illustrate the ER event selection for this
work. The lower panel of Fig. 1 shows the projection of
the selected ER events with the 1460.8 keV γ-line from
40K and the 2614.5 keV γ-line from 208Tl highlighted.

B. Energy Calibration

The DAQ system, including PMT gain and ampliﬁ-
cation,
is optimized for small signals from low-energy
WIMP interactions. Thus the energy calibration used
for the WIMP analysis is not necessarily appropriate for
high-energy signals as clipping of the waveform readout
and PMT saturation must be considered.

In this work an eﬀective calibration is used. The γ-
lines from 40K and 208Tl are used to deﬁne a quadratic
function

E = 0 + p1 × PE + p2 × PE2 .

(1)

Other prominent γ-lines, e.g. from 214Bi, have secondary
γ-lines within the peak resolution and are not suitable
for precise calibration. In each run, the γ-lines are ﬁtted
with a Gaussian peak shape and an empirical background
function consisting of two constants connected with an
error function ﬁxed to the mean and the width of the peak
shape. The means of both γ-lines are extracted for each
run with suﬃcient statistics. The mean peak position of
the 2614.5 keV γ-line is plotted for 350 out of 402 runs

in Fig. 2, illustrating energy scale variations up to 2.5%.
The eﬀects of these variations are corrected by calibrat-
ing the energy scale on a run-to-run basis. For 52 runs
with insuﬃcient statistics, the previous run calibration is
used. The spectrum obtained after calibrating each run
to keV and then summing up the individual spectra is
shown in Fig. 3. For use in the analysis, the calibrated
energy spectrum is converted back into corrected photo-
electrons (PEcorr) in which the quadratic term in Eq. 1
is removed. The PEcorr energy scale, on which the ﬁt is
later performed, is also shown in Fig. 3.

FIG. 2. The position of the 2614.5 keV peak from 208Tl for
runs in the dataset. 52 short runs with insuﬃcient statistics
out of 402 total runs are not shown. Uncertainties of the
peak position are shown with a grey error band in the order
of 20 PE or 0.1%..

FIG. 3. Energy spectrum calibrated in keV and PEcorr.
Prominent energies are shown as vertical dashed lines. The
summation peaks of 208Tl are clearly visible and indicated
with arrows. In the energy calibration based on single γ-ray
peaks, the summation peaks are mis-calibrated as discussed
in the text.

close to the LAr in which summations of the 2614.5 keV
γ-ray with γ-rays at 583.2 keV, 860.6 keV or 1093.9 keV
can occur as shown in Fig. 3.

The eﬀect of topology on the measured energy is em-
pirically modeled in Monte Carlo with a correction term
based on the radius of a sphere containing 90% of the de-
posited energy (R90) as illustrated in Fig. 4. The R90 dis-
tributions for simulated events from 208Tl decays in the
AV bulk are shown in Fig. 5 (top). The single γ-line at
2614.5 keV shows signiﬁcantly lower R90 values peaking
at around 10 mm, with an exponential tail towards larger
spheres. The summation peaks, on the other hand, show
wider distributions peaking at around 200 mm which are
more dependent on the detector geometry and the dis-
tance of the source. This behavior is used to construct
an event by event energy correction E(cid:48) = E + ∆E in
which ∆E is based on an empirical function of R90 and
energy:

∆E(E, R90) = E × (q0 + q1 × R90 + q2 × R2

90) .

(2)

The parameters q0, q1, and q2 were manually determined
to best match an example spectrum from a 208Tl source
close to the LAr to data and set to 0, 1.4 × 10−4 and
−5.0 × 10−8, respectively. The energy shift for 208Tl
single and sum peaks is shown in Fig. 5 (bottom). A
Gaussian resolution (
r × PEcorr) is applied to the sim-
ulated spectra after the energy correction which already
introduces intrinsic smearing for diﬀerent event topolo-
gies. The eﬀective parameter r is later determined in an
energy response ﬁt.

√

Using an analytical eﬀective detector response allows
for (1) high statistics Monte Carlo simulations without
the computational cost of photon tracking; (2) simul-
taneous ﬁtting of background components and energy
scale/resolution; and (3) diﬀerent energy scales to be
applied to internal and external components to model
position dependencies and non-linearities at higher en-
ergies. The mathematical construction of the empirical
model conserves the total number of events for the ac-
tivity estimation. However, the correction of the energy
scale as well as the linearization of the response results
in eﬀective parameters which should only be interpreted
in achieving an optimal match of simulations to data.

III. BACKGROUND SOURCES

Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine the en-
ergy depositions in the LAr for each background com-
ponent in the model. This energy deposition spectrum
is convolved with an analytic detector response function
(for energy scale and resolution) to obtain a spectrum
that is compared with the linearized data in PEcorr.

The energy calibration described above is based on
peaks from single γ-rays. Events with more complicated
topologies (e.g. summation peaks) have a more diﬀuse
distribution of light and are thus less aﬀected by non-
linearities. Such an eﬀect is observed for sources of 208Tl

The vast majority of ER background in DEAP-3600 is
due to β-electron or γ-ray interactions with the LAr pro-
duced by nuclear decays. The muon background is sub-
dominant at the considered energies due to the low muon
rate at SNOLAB and the low probability of short track
length in the monolithic spherical detector. Background
components can be roughly divided into sources inter-
nal and external to the LAr. Internal backgrounds have
nearly 100% probability of generating a signal, whereas
external sources have a much lower probability. For inter-
nal sources, the large LAr volume functions as a calorime-

FIG. 4. Illustration of diﬀerent saturation eﬀects for single
γ-rays and summation γ-ray interactions. For close sources
of 208Tl (green) it is more likely that two γ-rays enter the LAr
creating a broader spacial distribution of energy depositions
and scintillation light than for single γ-rays (red). A more dif-
fuse light distribution will expose the PMT array more evenly
and results in overall less saturation. These topologies are dis-
tinguished with the size of the R90 parameter as illustrated
by the circles.

ter, mostly detecting the total γ-ray and β energy of
a decay. For external sources, primarily γ-rays are de-
tected. However, for sources close to the LAr such as the
AV itself, partial β and bremsstrahlung components can
contribute to the observed energy. In addition, a small
amount of Cherenkov light can add to the LAr scintilla-
tion light for simultaneous energy depositions in LAr and
non-scintillating optically transparent media such as the
AV or LG acrylic as well as the PMT glass.

Diﬀerent source positions of the same nuclide can pro-
duce degenerate experimental signatures in DEAP-3600.
For instance, the single 1460.8 keV γ-ray from the elec-
tron capture (EC) branch of 40K does not allow disen-
tangling the activity of multiple components at diﬀerent
In contrast, the multi-γ cascade of 208Tl decays
radii.
allows for the determination of the distance between the
source and the argon, using diﬀerent probabilities of sum-
mation γ-lines and diﬀerent peak-to-peak ratios due to
more strongly attenuated low energy γ-rays. Contribu-
tions from the 235U decay chain are generally omitted in
this analysis since its natural abundance is about a factor
of 20 below that of 238U and the chain does not contain
γ-rays with more than 5% emission probability above the
39Ar β endpoint.

The detector materials and their dominant background
contributions are illustrated in Fig. 6. The material assay
of individual components [18] is discussed in the appendix
and listed in Tab. V and VI.

topology.

A.

Internal Sources

Internal sources are expected to be homogeneously dis-

tributed in the bulk of the LAr.

39Ar LAr bulk and 42Ar/42K LAr bulk: 39Ar
and 42Ar are long lived radioactive isotopes of argon,
which have an approximately constant rate over the
timeframe of the dataset. They are produced cosmo-
genically and thus their speciﬁc activities are expected
to be equal in any argon batch extracted from the at-
mosphere. Both decays are unique ﬁrst-forbidden β-
decays to the ground state of the daughter with Q-
values of 565 ± 5 keV and 599 ± 6 keV, respectively. 39Ar
has a four order of magnitude higher speciﬁc activity
than 42Ar and dominates the low energy spectrum in
DEAP-3600. However, 42Ar decays are followed by de-
cays of 42K (T1/2=12.355 ± 0.007 h), with a Q-value of
3525.2 ± 0.2 keV, which dominates the energy spectrum
above 2.6 MeV.

85Kr (T1/2=10.739 ± 0.014 yr), a β emitter with a Q-
value of 687.0 keV was previously found in LAr detectors
[11, 19]; however, its speciﬁc activity depends on the LAr

puriﬁcation and is thus unique to each experiment or
measurement. A dedicated analysis has been performed
searching for the 85K decay to the 514.0 keV excited state
of 85Rb, with a probability of 0.434% and a half-life of
1.02 µs. This decay mode would result in two correlated
scintillation peaks in the same event trace. No evidence
of 85Kr has been observed in the data, and an upper
limit of 1.5 mBq/kg (90% CL) has been set. 85Kr is thus
neglected in the ER model as subdominant compared to
39Ar and other signals.

220Rn LAr bulk and 222Rn LAr bulk:

220Rn
(T1/2=55.6 ± 0.1 s) and 222Rn (T1/2=3.8235 ± 0.0003 d)
enter the LAr via the piping of the process system and
enhance the observed activity in the lower parts of the
238U and 232Th chains, respectively. The activities of
these isotopes are obtained from a dedicated in-situ α
background analysis [6]. In this dataset the process sys-
tems were isolated from the detector and the observed
α-decays show a constant rate, indicating a source in the
piping after the last valve or in the detector neck.

The ER background response is mainly due to β-decay
daughters of 214Bi and 208Tl, which have high Q-values
of 3270 keV and 4999 keV, respectively. The 222Rn chain
is broken at 210Pb (T1/2=22.2 ± 0.2 yr) which does not
reach equilibrium within the dataset. The chain below
210Pb is not considered in the background model.

B. LAr Surface/TPB Layer/Acrylic Surface

The analysis in [6] identiﬁes 210Po decays, fed by 210Pb,
on the TPB-acrylic interface and potentially in the ﬁrst
80 µm of the acrylic bulk. For the ER background model
considering β and γ-ray emission, these scenarios are ap-
proximately identical.

210Pb LAr surf: Only the 210Pb daughter 210Bi,
with a Q-value of 1162 keV, is considered in the model.
2.0 mBq originate from the TPB-acrylic interface and
< 3.3 mBq from the acrylic bulk which are combined
into one component.

2. LG Bulk and FB Bulk

232Th LG bulk and 232Th FB bulk: Both the
LGs and FBs are known from screening to be low in
radioactive contaminants. However, summation γ-lines
from 208Tl can have a dominant eﬀect in the spectrum
above 2614.5 keV. The slightly diﬀerent geometry of the
LGs and FBs allows for some breaking of the degeneracy
between them. Isotopes with a small Q-value and con-
sequently low γ-ray energies such as 210Pb in the 226Ra
chain and 228Ra in the 232Th chain cannot practically
contribute to the spectrum in the detector and are not
considered.

3. PMTs

The PMTs have the highest speciﬁc activity in
DEAP-3600. PMT glass, PMT inner components, and
PMT mounting components are individually tracked but
summed and treated as one component in the ﬁt, denoted
“PMT all”. The individual PMT components are listed
in Tab. VI in the appendix.

226Ra PMT all, 232Th PMT all, and 40K PMT
all: Activities from the primordial decay chains and 40K
are considered.

Neutron PMT glass: Neutrons created through
(α,n) reactions in the borosilicate PMT glass are cap-
tured in the surrounding material and create a variety of
γ-rays in a variety of locations through (n,γ) reactions.
This process is modeled in the simulation by generating
neutrons calculated for 238U in borosilicate glass with
SOURCES 4C [23]. The resulting ER spectrum from γ-
rays from neutron capture processes is mostly ﬂat, span-
ning an energy range up to 10 MeV. The only distinct fea-
ture is the 2224.5 keV γ-line from captures in 1H. (α,n)
reactions from 238U are the dominant neutron source in
DEAP-3600 and the resulting γ-ray spectrum serves as
an approximated template in the model. Simulations in-
dicate that spectra for (α,n) and spontaneous ﬁssion neu-
trons from the 238U, 235U, and 232Th decay chains are
similar to this template. In this analysis it serves only
as a high-energy γ-ray spectrum and is not used for a
neutron background prediction in DEAP-3600.

226Ra AV bulk and 232Th AV bulk: All β and
γ-ray emitting isotopes below 226Ra in the 238U decay
chain are considered as well as all such isotopes in the
232Th chain, since even low energy γ-rays can enter the
LAr from the AV. No evidence of 14C has been found in
the acrylic using accelerator mass spectrometry [20] and
14C is subsequently not considered in the model.

220Rn RnEm and 222Rn RnEm: Radon can, in
principle, emanate from materials inside the stainless
steel shell and freeze out at the cold outer AV surface.
This is a hypothetical component which is not included in
the model but investigated as a systematic uncertainty.

4. The Stainless Steel Shell bulk

Of the detector components considered in the model,
the SSS is the furthest away from the active volume, but
it also has the largest total mass. At the distance of the
SSS, only isotopes with suﬃciently high energy γ-rays
create a detector response.

226Ra SSS bulk and 232Th SSS bulk: For the
226Ra chain, only 214Bi is simulated; for the 232Th chain,
228Ac and 208Tl are simulated.

60Co SSS bulk: In addition to the primordial iso-
topes, signiﬁcant amounts of 60Co are present in the SSS

and 60Co is therefore considered in the model.

FIG. 6. Illustration of considered background components in
the detector setup (to scale). Shown are background source
positions from internal to far sources: liquid argon bulk (LAr
bulk), TPB-acrylic vessel interface (LAr surf), acrylic ves-
sel bulk (AV bulk), radon emanation towards the outer AV
surface (RnEm) light guide bulk (LG bulk), ﬁller block bulk
(FB bulk), PMT components (PMT all), borosilicate glass of
PMTs (PMT glass), stainless steel sphere bulk (SSS bulk).
Also illustrated is the ﬁll level, the attenuation length of
2614.5 keV and 1460 keV γ-rays in acrylic and LAr as well as
processes of neutron captures resulting in γ-rays.

5. Summary

The components entering the background model are
summarized in Tab. I. The ﬁrst column shows the back-
ground component indicating the radioactive isotope or
decay chain in a certain detector part. Only overall dom-
inant components are listed and their use in the model
is indicated in the second column. For each component,
only dominant isotopes are simulated which are shown in
the third column. The fourth column shows the total ex-
pected activity in the DEAP-3600 materials and is used
as prior information in the ﬁt. The quoted uncertainties
combine the uncertainty on the assayed speciﬁc activity
with the uncertainty on the total mass of the component.

analysis framework RAT [21] which is based on Geant4
[17] version 9.6.p02. The full optical model developed
for the dark-matter search analysis is not used here. Ra-
dioactive decays are modeled with the event generator
Decay0 [22] for each background component listed in
Tab. I. The number of generated decays varies depending
on the isotope and its distance from the LAr target. The
simulated number of decays may be more or less than the
expected number of decays in the data set. For example,
for 39Ar and 42K in the LAr bulk and 214Bi and 208Tl in
the PMTs, about 7 × 1010, 6 × 106, 5 × 109, and 8 × 108
decays are expected in the dataset, respectively, whereas
a total of 1 × 107, 1 × 107, 4.1 × 107, and 4.3 × 107 de-
cays are simulated for these components. Geant4 hit
positions and energy depositions are stored in optically
sensitive volumes for further post-processing, including
the empirical correction of the energy scale based on the
event topology.
Isotopes in the same decay chain are
summed together, accounting for their branching ratios
when secular equilibrium is assumed: e.g. the simulation
of 208Tl is added with a weight of 0.3594 to the 232Th
chain. The Monte Carlo energy depositions in the LAr
are shown in Fig. 7 for selected background components.
These are the base of the ER model and show the under-
lying spectral features which are ultimately smeared out
by the detector response. The vertical scaling illustrates
the probability of a detected signal for a given decay of
the head isotope in the background component.

IV. FITTING METHODOLOGY

Spectra from MC simulations of the individual back-
ground components in Tab. I are matched to the PEcorr
spectrum in the ER band in a combined ﬁt. All compo-
nents are scaled to livetime with the activity as a ﬁxed
or ﬂoated parameter in the ﬁt. A ﬂoated activity can be
constrained or free, depending on the prior information.
The ﬁt uses the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit (BAT) [24],
which uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo to extract poste-
rior probability distributions based on prior probabilities
and a user-deﬁned likelihood function.

The complete posterior probability p(λ|n) for the
model with the set of parameters λ given the data n
is obtained with Bayes’ Theorem connecting the likeli-
hood p(n|λ) with the prior information for each param-
eter p0(λ):

p(λ|n) =

p(n|λ) · p0(λ)
(cid:82) p(n|λ) · p0(λ) · dλ

.

D. Monte Carlo Simulations

The DEAP-3600 geometry, including the surrounding
hall at SNOLAB, is implemented in the simulation and

The denominator normalizes the probability. The like-
lihood is expressed as the product of Gaussian probabil-
ities in each 200 PEcorr bin i to observe ni events, given
the expectation µi, based on the model parameters λ,
and its uncertainty σi:

weighted by their component contribution in the
i,lk
i-th bin wi,k and their nuclide contribution in the back-
ground component wlk . For example, the 208Tl Monte
Carlo spectrum in the 232Th PMT component has a ﬁxed
wlk = 0.3594 given by its branching ratio in the decay
chain and a wi,k which depends on the 232Th PMT con-
tribution in bin i. The third component to σi is an ad-hoc
uncertainty of σbin = 0.03 in each bin in order to stabi-
lize the ﬁt against small systematic eﬀects in the energy
calibration. The large number of events in the data and
Monte Carlo simulations would require a highly accurate
model (e.g. with sub percent precision in each bin at the
2614.5 keV peak). The allowed bin-by-bin variation of
3% was found to mitigate this problem while not artiﬁ-
cially inﬂating the posterior distributions.

The prior information for the activity parameters is
based on screening results or literature values and is listed
further below together with the ﬁt results in Tab. II.
Three types of priors are distinguished (1) a Gaussian
prior for measurements in which the mean of the Gaus-
sian is the measured central activity value and the width
is the 1σ activity uncertainty, (2) the upper half of a
Gaussian in cases where only activity limits are known
and (3) a ﬂat prior for unbiased measurements or where
no prior knowledge is available.

The k (free) activity parameters and the uncertainty
on the global scale parameter (cid:15) span a k + 1-dimensional
parameter space. A prior probability of 0 is assigned to
all negative activity values.

The ﬁt is performed in multiple stages to facilitate con-
vergence and reduce the required computational time.
The Markov Chain Monte Carlo adopted in BAT requires
many sampling points in order to adequately map the
posterior probability space. The dimensional complexity
of the posterior increases with additional free parameters,
so that a combined ﬁt of all activity components and en-
ergy response parameters was not feasible. Furthermore,
when energy response parameters are included as free pa-
rameters, each simulated distribution has to be rebinned,
rescaled, and again smeared with a resolution response
at each sampling point. This process tremendously in-
creases the required CPU time.

The general strategy for ﬁtting is to treat the energy
response as eﬀective parameters and focus on extract-
ing posterior activities based on their prior knowledge.
Thus, the sequence is as follows: (1) Initially match the
energy response parameters manually to data; (2) Per-
form a preliminary ﬁt with ﬁxed energy response param-
eters to obtain a good match of Monte Carlo simulations
to data; (3) Fix the activity components from (2) and
perform a full ﬁt of energy response parameters; (4) Fix
the energy response parameters from (3) and perform a
component activity ﬁt w.r.t. the original prior knowledge.
This approach does not allow the calculation of parame-
ter correlations between energy response and component
activities. However, the energy scaling to PEcorr as de-
scribed above does not allow a meaningful interpretation
of the energy response parameters to begin with. For
the energy calibration in step (3), an additional free lin-
ear scaling parameter is allowed for the 39Ar component
which removes tension in the ﬁt due to its dominant num-
ber of counts and its large Q-value uncertainty of 5 keV
(0.9%). The ﬁt ﬁnds a 0.4% shift in energy for 39Ar w.r.t.
the other components. In the following, only step (4) is
discussed and later diﬀerent variations of these ﬁts are
performed to investigate systematic eﬀects and diﬀerent
model assumptions. The ﬁt is performed from 2000 to
35000 in the linearized PEcorr unit.

The global maximum of the extracted posterior distri-
bution is the best ﬁt value for each parameter. Further-
more, the posterior distributions are marginalized w.r.t.
each parameter in order to obtain the smallest connected
68% credibility intervals (CI), which can be interpreted
as individual 1σ parameter uncertainties. Finally, two-
parameter-pair distributions are marginalized to under-
stand parameter correlations.

V. RESULTS

The energy spectrum of the dataset and the ﬁt results
are shown in Fig. 8, along with the ﬁt residuals. The
ER background model describes the data well over 9 or-

9

ders of magnitude and a wide energy range. The residual
shows a few outlying bins. The conﬁdence belts in the
residual plot are based on the uncertainties used in the
likelihood (Eq. 6) which do not include systematic eﬀects
from the energy scale and resolution. Discrepancies seen
around steeply falling distributions at the 39Ar endpoint
(565 keV), the 208Tl peak (2615 keV), and the summa-
tion peaks around 3500 and 3750 keV are created by in-
accuracies in the energy response model. These do not
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the derived activity of the compo-
nents.

Tab. II gives the prior information and the ﬁt results
for each background component. The third column gives
the global maximum i.e. the best ﬁt value and the last
column gives the central 68% credibility interval of the
marginalized posterior distributions.

The prior distributions entering the ﬁt and the
marginalized posterior distributions are shown in Fig. 9.
The two-parameter pair posterior distributions are shown
in Fig. 10 for selected components and are discussed in
detail below.

The ﬁrst parameter in Fig. 9 is the global scale param-
eter uncertainty (cid:15) with a Gaussian prior centered around
1 with the width as the uncertainty of cut eﬃciencies.
The posterior distribution follows the prior distribution
and thus no knowledge update is obtained from the ﬁt,
but uncertainty correlations are naturally included in the
activity results.

The 39Ar activity has a prior probability distribution
peaked at 3282 Bq with 10% uncertainty, from [11]. After
the ﬁt, the posterior probability distribution is found to
have a peak at 3009 Bq with a 1% uncertainty or in
a 68% credibility interval of [2977 − 3042] Bq which is
about 10 times more precise than in [11]. However, since
the ﬁt is focused on the higher energy parts of the ER
band starting at 290 keV and the residual plot shows
unaccounted energy shape systematics in the 39Ar region,
at this time we refrain from quoting this number as a
new speciﬁc activity measurement in atmospheric LAr
and defer to a dedicated future analysis.

A ﬂat prior is used for the 42Ar/42K activity in order
to not rely on debated values in the literature. The pos-
terior distribution has a width of about 2%, but excludes
important systematics from the energy scale and the β-
decay spectral shape. A dedicated analysis is presented
in Sec. VII.

222Rn and its short-lived daughters in the LAr bulk,
as well as the 210Pb contribution on the LAr-TPB in-
terface, are included in the model but ﬁxed in the ﬁt.
Their activities were determined from dedicated α-decay
analyses [6] and are negligible in the ER band. These
components serve mainly an illustrational purpose. In-
ternal 220Rn and its daughter 208Tl can create the high-
est energy radioactive decay signals in DEAP-3600 with
energies up to its Q-value of 4999.0 keV. The spectrum
is dominated by two β shape contributions, as shown in
Fig. 8: one where the 2614.5 keV γ-ray escapes the LAr
and one where it is contained. However, at its highest

chain or subchain included in the model; prior information used in the ﬁt; best ﬁt results from the global maximum; central
connected 68% credibility interval of the marginalized parameter space or the 90% quantile in case of a limit. The input can

ﬁxed value (denoted with = ). All priors are deﬁned to be non-negative (i.e. Gaussian priors centered around zero denote upper
activity limits). The entry “neutron PMT glass” refers to the neutron production rate (in Hz) in a model where all neutrons
come from the PMT glass. See text for a discussion of systematic uncertainties in the PMT glass.

signiﬁcance at around 4.3 MeV, this component is more
than an order of magnitude lower than the signal from
γ-rays produced by neutron capture reactions. Thus, the
sensitivity to 220Rn in the LAr bulk is small, and the
posterior follows the prior information from the α-decay
analysis as shown in Fig. 9.

The external

232Th chain contribution with the
2614.5 keV γ-line as its most dominant feature is shared
between the close sources in the AV, LG and FB bulks
as well as between far sources in the PMTs and the SSS
bulk. All of these components are left ﬂoating in the ﬁt,
with prior constraints. The main discrimination power
between sources close to and far from the LAr comes
from the summation peaks. For the sources close to the
LAr, only upper limits are available as input prior. The
ﬁt ﬁnds a signiﬁcant source in the AV bulk at 15 mBq,
compared to the previously known limit of < 220 mBq.
The LG contribution is consistent with 0, but the best ﬁt
value is found at 134 mBq (see Fig. 8 and 9). No signiﬁ-
cant correlation of close sources (represented by the AV
bulk concentration in Fig. 10) with far sources (PMT,
SSS) is observed. The activity of 232Th in the sources
far from the LAr is found to be signiﬁcantly higher than
expected, with strong correlations between the best ﬁt
activities in these sources. This additional 232Th activ-
ity is mainly put into the SSS bulk due its less precise
screening results and therefore wider prior distribution.

For dark matter experiments such as DEAP-3600, it
is important to understand uncertainties on the activi-
ties in PMTs, as (α,n) reactions in borosilicate glass are
a source of fast neutrons. Furthermore, the prior esti-

mates for both the PMT components and the stainless
steel in the ﬁt were based on sample measurements which
may not be completely representative of the whole. To
address these concerns the ﬁt was repeated twice: ﬁrst,
the contamination from 232Th in the stainless steel was
ﬁxed at its prior of 9.7 Bq and the contamination from
PMT glass was allowed to ﬂoat, resulting in an activity of
58.0 Bq. Second, the activity of 232Th in the PMTs was
ﬁxed at the prior value of 39.0 Bq and the contamination
in the SSS was allowed to ﬂoat, resulting in a value of
70.6 Bq. Including this systematic eﬀect, the activity of
the 232Th in the PMT glass is within the range of 38 to
58 Bq.

The dominant presence of 226Ra (subchain in the 238U
decay chain) is expected to be in the PMTs and the SSS
bulk. The most prominent features in the ER spectrum
are the peaks from the 1764.5 keV and 2204.1 keV γ-rays
from 214Bi. These features are dominated by the PMT’s
contribution by about 2 orders of magnitude. For the
AV bulk contribution only prior limits are known. The
ﬁt ﬁnds 0 as best ﬁt value while being able to constrain
the limit further. The PMT’s contribution is found to be
a factor of 1.6 lower than the prior expectation which is
about 3.3 σ lower than ex-situ assay values. This indi-
cates a non-representative screening sample or a mislead-
ing correlation with the less well-known SSS bulk activity.
No strong correlation is observed with other background
components, indicating that the sensitivity to this com-
ponent is indeed coming from the γ-lines and not from
the continuum in the spectrum.

The single γ-ray from 40K does not allow disentan-

gling activities of components at diﬀerent distances, i.e.
from the AV, LGs, FBs, and the PMTs. Without an
assumption of the source positions, the screening knowl-
edge cannot be converted into a prior activity and thus
a ﬂat prior was chosen. All 40K events in the spectrum
are interpreted as coming from the PMTs, which are ex-
pected to have the highest activity. An eﬀective activity
of 776 Bq is determined, compared to an expected ac-
tivity of 454 Bq. The discrepancy could be explained by
lower activity sources closer to the target, i.e. the acrylic
and PE material in the AV, LG and FB.

The 60Co prior activity from screening the SSS is
known with 15% precision. The ﬁt ﬁnds a factor of 1.7
lower activity than expected. This could be due to a
non-representative screening sample.

The component of γ-rays

from neutron capture
reactions is included into the ﬁt with a ﬂat prior. Their
contribution is dominant above about 4 MeV, which
allows a precise measurement without strong correlations
with other sources in the ﬁt. The γ-line from neutron
capture on 1H at 2224.6 keV is clearly visible in the
simulated spectrum, but subdominant compared to
other signals in this region.

Based on the full model, two dedicated ﬁts were per-
formed to investigate the hypothetical contributions of
emanated 220Rn and 222Rn within the steel shell freez-
ing out on the outer AV surface (see 220Rn RnEm and
222Rn RnEm in Fig. 6).
In a ﬁrst ﬁt, these compo-
nent were added to the full model. The experimental
signature is dominated by 208Tl and 214Bi, respectively,
which diﬀer only slightly in their summation peak ra-
tios compared to other close components. The ﬁt ﬁnds
zero activity as best ﬁt values, however, strong correla-
tions with other close sources are observed. As a worst
case scenario, a second ﬁt without AV, LG, FB compo-
nents was performed so that the 220Rn eman and 222Rn
eman components account for all summation peak fea-
tures. This ﬁt ﬁnds 0.019 ± 0.001 Bq and < 0.06 Bq
for 220Rn and 222Rn, respectively, which constrains the
activity of radon daughters for (α,n) production close to
the LAr target to < 0.02 Bq and < 0.06 Bq, respectively.

VI. VERIFICATION WITH EXTERNAL
GAMMA RAY SOURCES

The analysis chain and Monte Carlo simulations were
tested with a 232U calibration source in a source deploy-
ment tube just outside the steel shell. 232U (T1/2=68.9 ±
0.4 yr) decays into 228Th, emulating the lower part of a
distant 232Th decay chain as might be seen from contri-
butions in the SSS or the PMTs. The total trigger rate is
only increased by 1.4% and does not signiﬁcantly change
the detector system during these calibration campaigns.
Only 208Tl decays are simulated in the source since γ-
rays from other 232U decay chain isotopes are strongly at-
tenuated. The calibrated 232U source activity was 15.3 ±

11

1.5 kBq leading to a 208Tl activity of 5.51 ± 0.55 kBq. A
22.16 h source run was taken and analyzed using the same
procedure as used for the standard dataset. The full ER
background model was used, with all components, except
for 39Ar, ﬁxed to their best ﬁt values. The activity of the
232U source was given a ﬂat prior and ﬂoated in the ﬁt.
The best ﬁt value for the 232U source activity is 19%
lower than expected from the datasheet of the source,
though we point out that the activity stated on the
datasheet has an uncertainty of 10%. The 68% conﬁ-
dence interval from the ﬁt corresponds to 0.7% of the
ﬁt value, which does not include systematic uncertain-
ties from positioning and missing details in the Geant4
model of the steel shell. Small variations of the amount
of water as well as screws and bolts can change the at-
tenuation of γ-rays in-between the source and the LAr.
Such uncertainties are expected to be much smaller for
background components within the SSS whose positions
are well known and have been carefully veriﬁed. We thus
consider this a satisfactory validation of the model.

VII. SPECIFIC ACTIVITY OF 42Ar AND 42K

42Ar is present as a cosmogenic trace isotope in at-
mospheric argon. The production mechanisms are (1)
cosmic α-particles inducing (α,2p) reactions on 40Ar in
the outer atmosphere and (2) double neutron capture
40Ar(n,γ)41Ar(n,γ)42Ar. The production by process (1)
is estimated to be dominant and constant over time with
a 42Ar/40Ar ratio of ≈ 10−20 g/g [25], whereas the pro-
duction via process (2) requires the high neutron ﬂux
from atmospheric nuclear weapon testing, which stopped
in the 1980’s and can thus only account for a 42Ar/40Ar
ratio of ≈ 10−22 − 10−21 g/g [26].

Due to its long half-life of T1/2=32.9 ± 1.1 yr, 42Ar
is well-mixed in the atmosphere, and its speciﬁc activ-
ity today is constant in time. The short half-life of its
daughter 42K (T1/2=12.4 h) means that the isotopes are

with 3525.2 ± 0.2 keV endpoint are easier to measure
than 42Ar β-decays with 599 ± 6 keV endpoint.

The concentration of 42Ar in atmospheric argon was
measured in the past. Ashitkov et al. studied 42K decays
with a LAr ionization detector [14, 15]. These data were
re-analyzed by Barabash et al. [16]. The GERDA exper-
iment [10] used HPGe detectors immersed in a large LAr
tank to measure the speciﬁc activity. The diﬀerent mea-
surements of the 42K activity, collated in Tab. III, are in
tension with each other. For the LAr ionization detector
[16], the energy region between 3.1 and 3.6 MeV is used
to count events coming from β’s in the tail end of the 42K
spectrum, while subtracting events expected from back-
grounds. An activity of 92+22
−46 µBq/kg is quoted where
the background subtraction and energy calibration of this
region are the largest sources of systematic uncertainties.
In the GERDA experiment, the measured activity is
extracted from a full background model ﬁt, mainly sensi-

tive to the 1524.6 keV peak counts from the 42K excited
state transition which has an 18% branching ratio. Dif-
ferent model assumptions with diﬀerent complexity yield
results varying between 91+8
−18 µBq/kg [10].
The 42Ar concentration in LAr can be assumed homoge-
neous, but GERDA observed that a fraction of the 42K
daughters is charged after the initial 42Ar decay, and its
concentration can be distorted by electric ﬁelds. Espe-
cially in the case of GERDA with high voltage biased
germanium detectors, this leads to the attraction of 42K
ions towards the n+ surface of the detectors at positive
2 to 4 keV [10]. The issue of 42K ion drift was miti-
gated with a copper shroud around the detector strings,
shielding the electric ﬁeld, and the above activities are
obtained assuming a homogenous 42K distribution.

In DEAP-3600 no electric ﬁeld is present and the 42Ar
and 42K concentrations can be assumed homogeneous.
The activity is extracted from the full ER background
model ﬁt, which is most sensitive in the region above
2.8 MeV. Thus DEAP-3600 provides a third indepen-
dent measurement with diﬀerent systematic uncertainties
which are explored below.

The best ﬁt of the total 42Ar/42K activity in the
DEAP-3600 LAr is 0.129 Bq, which translates into a
speciﬁc activity of 39.6 µBq/kg. The marginalized poste-
rior distribution yields a width of about 2% uncertainty.
However, systematic uncertainties dominate as follows.

The decay of 42K results in a single β with an endpoint
of 3.525 MeV, with 81.9% branching ratio. Thus it has a
diﬀerent topology, and diﬀerent saturation eﬀects, than
the multiple γ-ray interactions of 208Tl sources close to
the LAr, which is the dominant background for this mea-
surement above 2.8 MeV. To estimate the uncertainty
from the energy scale, the analysis was repeated with-
out the topology corrections, resulting in a ﬁt activity of
0.113 Bq, or a 13% decrease. This is taken as the con-
servative systematic uncertainty from energy scale uncer-
tainties.

The 42K decay is expected to be isotropic in the de-
tector and will thus have diﬀerent saturation eﬀects than
external single γ-rays which interact close to the edge of
the detector. In order to estimate this eﬀect, the default
energy scale is used, except for the 42K component, which
is assigned a free linear energy scaling parameter. The
energy scale correction parameter for 42K is ﬁtted be-
tween 20000 and 34000 PEcorr simultaneously with the

42K activity and the activity of the relevant contributions
in this range. In this case, the energy scale of 42K is in-
creased by 0.32% and the change in derived activity of
42K is less than 0.8%.

The 42K β-decay into the ground state of 42Ca is a
2− to 0+ 1st-forbidden unique transition with theoreti-
cal uncertainties on the spectral shape. The analysis was
repeated with an allowed β spectrum used instead of the
1st-forbidden spectrum. The best ﬁt value changes to
0.123 Bq ([0.120 − 0.125] Bq in a 68% CI). We conserva-
tively take this 4.7% shift as the systematic uncertainty
from uncertainties in the spectral shape.

Three additional uncertainties are considered which di-
rectly aﬀect the activity estimate: (1) uncertainty on the
LAr mass in the detector, (2) uncertainty on the MC
simulation, and (3) uncertainty on the age of the argon,
measured from the time the argon was extracted from
the atmosphere. The time from atmospheric extraction
by the vendor to the start of data taking is estimated as
0.5 yr but has a large uncertainty. Thus, the average age
during the 1 yr dataset is about 1.0±0.5 yr which reduces
the activity by 2.1 ± 1.0% with respect to atmospheric
argon. All systematic uncertainties are summarized in
Tab. IV.

The measured speciﬁc activity of 42Ar/42K for LAr in
DEAP-3600 is 39.6 ± 5.8 µBq/kg. Extrapolating back to
the time of extraction from the atmosphere, the speciﬁc
activity is estimated to be

A = 40.4 ± 5.9 µBq/kg.

This value is signiﬁcantly lower than found in previous

experiments [10, 16].

VIII. CONCLUSION

Electromagnetic backgrounds are described for the
DEAP-3600 detector. They are modeled over an energy
range from 290 keV to 5 MeV and more than 9 orders of
magnitude in vertical scaling. The activity of 42Ar in at-
mospheric argon has been found to be 40.4 ± 5.9µBq/kg
which is lower than measured in previous work and rep-
resents a signiﬁcant reduction in uncertainty.

Of particular importance to the WIMP search, the

Bayesian model, the best ﬁt for 232Th activity was
41.5 Bq (68% statistical credibility interval between 38.1
and 44.4 Bq) and between 38 and 58 Bq after includ-
ing systematic eﬀects from correlations with the ac-
tivity in the stainless steel shell. The activity of the
226Ra subchain in the 238U decay chain was found to
be 136 Bq (68% statistical credibility interval between
131 and 137 Bq).

In addition, the hypothetical contribution of emanated
220Rn and 222Rn plated out on the outer AV surface could
be constrained to < 0.02 Bq and < 0.06 Bq, respectively,
for a worst-case scenario.

A. Material Assays

The speciﬁc radioactivities of the main materials are
shown in Tab. V along with the number of components in
DEAP-3600 and their total mass. The speciﬁc activities
are quoted as 90% upper limits for measurements below
the assay sensitivity and with 1σ uncertainties otherwise.

Special care is taken for the PMTs which contain sev-
eral materials with high speciﬁc activity.
Individual
PMT components were separated and measured individ-
ually [3, 18]. The speciﬁc activities as well as total activ-
ity budget of the PMTs is shown in Tab. VI.

Materials with smaller masses and smaller radioactiv-

17

ity were evaluated but not included into the model in
order to reduce complexity. The 14C content of the AV
acrylic was assayed with Accelerator Mass Spectrometry
at Ottawa University [20] to less than 0.022 Bq/kg C.
This amounts to a negligible contribution of < 12 Bq
in the whole AV. Other stainless steel components used
as connectors between LGs, FBs and PMTs account for
about 250 kg of stainless steel. This amounts to a total of
approximately 0.56 Bq of 226Ra, 0.51 Bq of 232Th, 1.3 Bq
of 40K and 4.1 Bq of 60Co. These components are sub-
dominant compared to the activity of the PMTs at about
the same distance to the LAr and subdominant compared
to the mass of the steel shell at a slightly larger distance.
Other materials such as insulating polyurethane foam be-
tween PMTs and steel shell were assayed but found to be
negligible with a total mass of about 80 kg.
