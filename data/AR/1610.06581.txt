We propose a test based on direct detection data that allows to determine if the dark matter particle is different
from its antiparticle. The test requires the precise measurement of the dark matter spin-independent direct detec-
tion cross sections off three different nuclei, and consists of interpreting such signals in terms of self-conjugate
(particle = antiparticle) dark matter to see if such interpretation is consistent. If it is not, the dark matter must
be different from its antiparticle. We illustrate this procedure for two sets of target nuclei, {Xe, Ar, Si} and
{Xe, Ar, Ge}, identifying the regions of the parameter space where it is particularly feasible. Our results indi-
cate that future signals in direct detection experiments, if sufﬁciently accurate, might be used to establish that
the dark matter particle is not its own antiparticle –a major step towards the determination of the fundamental
nature of the dark matter.

Introduction. The existence of dark matter (DM) has been
established, via its gravitational effects, through a variety of
observations at different scales –from galaxies to the largest
structures in the Universe. According to the most recent data,
DM accounts for about 27% of the total energy density of the
Universe and about 85% of its matter density [1]. And yet,
the fundamental nature of the DM particle (e.g. its mass, spin,
quantum numbers, etc.) remains a mystery, providing one of
the most important open problems in particle and astroparticle
physics today [2, 3]. Its solution will be crucial, in particular,
to establish the new Standard Model of particle physics.

Within this context, it is essential to determine whether the
DM particle is its own antiparticle. This amounts to whether it
is a Majorana or a Dirac particle for fermion DM, or whether
it is a real or a complex particle for scalar and vector DM.
Among the multitude of models that have been proposed to
account for the DM, it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd suitable candi-
dates for each of these cases –see e.g. [4–9]. The neutralino
of the MSSM [4] and a heavy neutrino [10] supply, for ex-
ample, well-known instances of Majorana and Dirac DM, re-
spectively. But, is there a way to experimentally distinguish
between these two possibilities?

Here, we propose a test that allows to determine if the DM
particle is different from its antiparticle.
It relies on direct
detection data only and requires the precise measurement of
the DM spin-independent cross section off three different nu-
clei. The idea is to interpret these measurements in terms of
self-conjugate DM (particle = antiparticle) and see if that in-
terpretation is consistent. If it is not, the DM particle must be
different from its antiparticle. In other words, it is a test that
can exclude a DM particle that is identical to its antiparticle.
Figure 1 illustrates pictorially how the test works.

For clarity, in our discussion we will initially focus on
fermion DM and the possibility of differentiating between
Dirac and Majorana DM, but we later show that the test works
the same way for scalar and vector DM.

and odd operators are in general both present and there are
two different spin-independent cross sections with nuclei –
one for the DM particle (σSI ), and one for the DM antipar-
ticle (¯σSI ). It is useful to deﬁne, in this case, the parameters
N ≡ (λN,e +λN,o)/2 and λ ¯D

N ≡ (λN,e −λN,o)/2, which re-
spectively determine σSI and ¯σSI . Within the standard WIMP
framework, the DM particles and antiparticles are expected to
have the same or very similar densities, so the experimentally

For deﬁniteness, the spin-dependent contribution to the sig-
nal rate is taken to be negligible throughout our analysis. The
event rate at a DM detector is then given by R = σX IX ,
where σX is the Dirac or Majorana cross section off the nu-
cleus X –equations (2) or (3)–, which is determined by the
underlying particle physics model; IX , on the other hand, de-
pends on experimental, astrophysical, and nuclear physics in-

where nχ is the local number density of DM particles, NT
is the number of target nuclei, v is the velocity of the DM
particle, f (v) is the DM velocity distribution, and FX is the
nuclear form factor. Usually, IX is assumed to be given (e.g.
by assuming the standard halo model –see however [12–15]
for alternative approaches), allowing to translate the absence
of signals in current experiments into upper bounds on the
cross sections [16, 17]. In the same way, an observed signal
in a future experiment could be translated into a certain range
for the cross section.

Dirac or Majorana dark matter? Since the direct detec-
tion cross sections for Dirac and Majorana DM have different
functional dependencies, it should be possible to determine,
given a certain number of observations, whether the experi-
mental data is described by equation (2) or equation (3). That
is, it seems feasible to distinguish Dirac DM from Majorana
DM with just direct detection data. Our proposal to do so is to
try to explain the direct detection signals in terms of Majorana
DM, and check if that interpretation is consistent. If it is not,
it can be ascertained that the DM is a Dirac particle.

To illustrate the basic idea behind this test, we ﬁrst consider
a simpliﬁed scenario. Let us assume, for example, that the
DM cross section off the nuclei AX
Y have been
ZX
measured to be ˜σX and ˜σY , respectively. Interpreting these
results in terms of Majorana DM implies, from equation (2),
that

Each of these equations describes, in the plane (λM
n ),
two parallel lines with slopes mX = ZX /(AX − ZX ) and
mY = ZY /(AY − ZY ). For mX (cid:54)= mY these lines would
always intersect, in pairs, at four different points. These four
values of (λM
n ) would thus be consistent with both mea-
surements (notice though that two of these solutions corre-
spond to the global sign change (λM
n ),

n ) → (−λM

so only two solutions are actually different). Thus, two DM
scattering signals off different nuclei are always consistent
with Majorana DM. But, if the DM cross section off another
nuclei, say V , were also measured and found to be ˜σV , two
things could happen with its corresponding parallel lines:

1. At least one of them would pass through one of the two
distinct points consistent with the X and Y measure-
ments. In this case, we would have determined, up to a
global sign, the values of λM
n , but we could not
say anything about the Dirac or Majorana nature of the
DM particle.

p and λM

2. None of them would pass through one of the two dis-
tinct points consistent with the X and Y measurements.
In this case, the three measurements would be inconsis-
tent and our interpretation in terms of a Majorana DM
particle must be wrong. We would conclude, therefore,
that the DM is a Dirac particle.

Thus, direct detection signals can be used, at least in prin-
ciple, to exclude the possibility of Majorana DM, establishing
the Dirac nature of the DM particle. But such signals could
never demonstrate the Majorana nature of the DM particle or,
equivalently, exclude a Dirac DM particle. The reason for this
asymmetry is that the Dirac DM detection cross section can
always be reduced to a Majorana form, but not the other way
around. At the Lagrangian level the issue is clear: a Dirac
DM particle has both scalar and vector interactions whereas a
Majorana DM particle has only scalar interactions.

To be able to say anything about the Dirac or Majorana na-
ture of the DM particle, the observed signals must therefore
be due to a Dirac particle. In that case, our problem consists
in determining whether, for a given set of {λD
n },
there exist values of λM

(where k denotes the different nuclei) is inconsistent. Notice
that the reduced mass drops out from this equation and with
it the dependence on the DM mass. Thus, whether the sys-
tem in equation (7) is inconsistent or not does not depend on
the mass of the DM particle. By the same token, one can see
that this system is invariant under a global rescaling of all the
couplings, making the precise value of the cross sections ir-
relevant to the issue of Dirac vs. Majorana DM. Finally, this
system depends on the number or protons and neutrons in the
nuclei only through their ratio, Z/(A − Z), which, as we have
already argued, should take different values for the three nu-
clei considered. It turns out though that Z/(A − Z) varies
only between 1 and 0.65 for stable nuclei, and it is very sim-
ilar for some of the nuclei that are of interest to DM experi-
ments: about 1 for {Si, Ca, O}, about 0.68 for {Xe, W} and
about 0.91 for {F, Na}. To help discriminate between Dirac
and Majorana DM, only one element of each of these sets is
actually useful.

Before proceeding, let us emphasize that there are some
special cases in which direct detection experiments cannot
differentiate between Dirac and Majorana DM, because the

Majorana direct detection cross section takes exactly the same
form as the Dirac one, namely: (i) When the Dirac fermion
has either scalar or vector interactions but not both; (ii) When
the couplings of the Dirac fermion are such that either the par-
ticle or the antiparticle cross section vanishes for all nuclei or
the density of the Dirac dark matter particle is much smaller or
larger than the density of the antiparticle; (iii) When the DM
particle couples only to protons or neutrons but not to both;
(iv) When the ratio between the coupling to the proton and to
the neutron is the same for the DM particle and the antiparti-
cle.

Application. Let us now go beyond the simpliﬁed frame-
work introduced above and consider a more realistic setup.
First of all, the scattering cross sections can only be mea-
sured up to a certain accuracy (∆σ). Thus, ˜σX in equa-
tion (5) should be replaced by ˜σX ± ∆˜σX , with the result
that the straight-line solutions actually consists of bands of ﬁ-
nite width, and the intersecting points become overlapping re-
gions. Clearly, the larger the uncertainty in the cross sections
the more difﬁcult it will be to distinguish Dirac from Majorana
DM. Regarding the expected uncertainty on the determination
of the cross sections, several previous works have already es-
timated its size under different conditions [19, 20]. An ac-
curacy of order 10% seems to be achievable for the ﬁducial
astrophysical setup [19] and a light DM particle, Mχ (cid:46) 100
GeV. To simplify the analysis, throughout the rest of the pa-
per the DM mass is set to 100 GeV, and the accuracy in the
determination of the cross sections is taken to be the same for
all targets.

Second, the targets used in DM detection experiments often
include multiple isotopes of the same element. Xenon, Ger-
manium and Silicon, for example, consist of 7, 5, and 3 differ-
ent isotopes with abundances larger than 1%, respectively, as
shown in Table I. For nuclei with multiple isotopes, the event
rate is thus modiﬁed to R = (cid:80)
i ηiσXi IX ,
where the sum is over isotopes Xi with fractional abundance
ηi, and, in the last step, we used the fact that the IXi do
not vary much for different i. The cross sections discussed
in the previous section should, therefore, be replaced by the
weighted sum over the multiple isotopes for a given target:
σX → (cid:80)
i ηiσXi. The left-hand side of equation (5), for in-
stance, becomes a sum of several terms, and the solution no
longer consists of two parallel lines (or bands) but rather of

jorana interpretation of the signals expected in three different tar-
gets: Xe (red), Ar (blue) and Si (green). Since these regions do not
overlap, a Majorana DM particle can be excluded. The width of the
bands is the result of a 50% uncertainty assumed in the determina-
tion of the cross sections with the nuclei. The signal is due to a Dirac

tal limits), corresponds to dark matter-nucleon cross sections of [18]

Finally, we also need to ensure that the resulting cross sec-
tions are consistent with current data and that they lie, in a
broad sense, within the sensitivity that could be reached by fu-
ture experiments. Our task is then to ﬁnd a set of three nuclei
p , λD
and given values for {λD
n } such that, under these
conditions, an interpretation of the expected spin-independent
signals in terms of Majorana DM can be excluded.

Let us take {Xe, Ar, Si} as our set of three nuclei where
spin-independent signals are assumed to have been ob-
served. Xenon not only sets the strongest limits on the spin-
independent direct detection cross section [16, 17] at high DM
masses, but it is also the target of choice for a new genera-
tion of experiments that are currently taking data [21] or are
expected to run in the near future [22]. Argon was used by
the DarkSide experiment [23] and features in some ongoing
projects aiming at ton-scale detectors [24, 25]. The choice
of Silicon as the third nucleus is motivated by having a ra-
tio Z/(A − Z) close to 1 –signiﬁcantly larger than for Xe
and Ar– and by the fact that it was previously used by the
CDMS collaboration as a DM target [26]. Figure 2 shows, for
a speciﬁc parameter point, the regions in the plane (λM
p , λM

that are consistent with each observation: Xe (red), Ar (blue)
and Si (green). The width of the bands is set by a 50% un-
certainty assumed in the determination of the cross sections.

points for Xe, Ar, Si and Xe, Ar, Ge target sets. The color code in-
dicates the required accuracy (R.A.) that enables to distinguish Dirac
from Majorana DM: dark cyan for points with R.A. < 1%, red for
points with 1% < R.A. < 10%, and black for points featuring
R.A. > 10%.

Even though they look like straight lines, the consistent re-
gions for Xe and Si are actually ellipses that extend up to
p,n| ∼ 40 × 10−9 GeV−2. As expected, the slopes of the
|λM
bands are determined by the ratio Z/(A − Z). We veriﬁed
numerically, and it can also be directly seen in the ﬁgure, that
these three regions never overlap. Consequently, the DM has
to be a Dirac particle.

Had we instead found overlapping regions, the test would
have been inconclusive. That is how the test we are proposing
works. It allows, once certain conditions are met, to exclude a
Majorana DM particle, being similar in spirit to the early tests
suggested to test the Majorana nature of the neutrino [27, 28].
Summarizing, we have shown, for the ﬁrst time, not only that
it is possible to experimentally differentiate between Majo-
rana and Dirac DM but also that it can be achieved with just
direct detection data.

Detailed Analysis. To get a better sense of how feasible
it is to distinguish Dirac from Majorana DM using the test
described above, we now generalize our previous discussion
in two ways. First, we consider, in addition to {Xe, Ar, Si},

a second set of three nuclei: {Xe, Ar, Ge}. Germanium de-
tectors currently provide the most stringent constraints on
the scattering cross section at low DM masses [29, 30], and
prominently feature in the EURECA project [31]. The com-
plementarity of {Xe, Ar, Ge}, in fact, has been considered in
previous works [19, 32]. Regarding the discrimination be-
tween Dirac and Majorana DM, a disadvantage of Ge is that
its ratio Z/(A − Z) is not that different from that of Xe and
Ar. In any case, using this second set should give us an idea of
how our results depend on the target nuclei. Second, we study
the full parameter space relevant for spin-independent direct
detection searches, which consists of λD
n . After
randomly scanning this parameter space we compute the DM
cross sections off {Xe, Ar, Si(Ge)} and the accuracy required
to exclude a Majorana DM particle. The resulting sample of
models is shown, projected onto different planes, in ﬁgures 3
and 4, enforcing an accuracy larger than 0.1%.

guish Dirac from Majorana DM: dark cyan for points with
R.A. < 1%, red for points with 1% < R.A. < 10%, and
black for points featuring R.A. > 10%. Notice, in particular,
that the black points –the most interesting ones– lie just below

section for either the DM particle or the antiparticle.

nation of the cross sections for the two different target sets.
Since we found no points with a required accuracy larger than
60% (20% for the set including Ge), this ﬁgure suggests that
future experiments should at least reach that level of preci-
sion to be able to differentiate Dirac from Majorana DM. It
also tell us that, as expected, the set {Xe, Ar, Si} offers better
prospects in this regard.

Scalar and Vector dark matter. Our results so far are valid
if the DM particle is a fermion, but we now show that they can
be straightforwardly generalized to scalar and vector DM. If
the DM particle is a scalar ﬁeld (φχ), the effective Lagrangian
describing its spin-independent interactions with nucleons is
written as

L S

with λN,o = 0 for a real scalar. The spin-independent cross
sections are given by the same expression as the Majorana
(real scalar) and Dirac (complex scalar) cases –equations (2)
and (3). Hence, it is possible to differentiate real scalar DM
from complex scalar DM in exactly the way already explained
for fermion DM.

For vector DM, the situation is entirely analogous –see e.g.
[11]. Putting together the results for fermion DM with the
generalization to scalar and vector DM just discussed, it can
be concluded that the test can potentially tell the DM particle
apart from its antiparticle.

Outlook. Once direct detection signals are observed, a joint

5

likelihood analysis would be required to combine the data
from the different experiments, to properly include all the rel-
evant uncertainties, and to assign a precise statistical meaning
to the exclusion of a self-conjugate dark matter particle. In
addition, a more comprehensive list of possible effective op-
erators [33] could be included in the analysis.

Conclusions. We have proposed a test that may determine
if the DM particle is different from its antiparticle. The min-
imum requirement to be able to do so was found to be the
precise measurement of the DM spin-independent scattering
cross section with three different nuclei. The test consists in
checking the consistency of these measurements with their
interpretation in terms of Majorana or real dark matter.
If
an inconsistency is found, the DM must be a Dirac or com-
plex particle. As an illustration, we considered the target sets
{Xe, Ar, Si} and {Xe, Ar, Ge}, and showed that, provided the
scattering cross sections are determined with a precision better
than 60% and 20% respectively, there exist parameter space
points for which the Dirac or complex nature of the DM parti-
cle can be established. Our results suggest that the observation
of spin-independent signals in future direct detection experi-
ments might be used to elucidate the fundamental nature of
the dark matter particle.
