at He I 584˚A. We analyzed 3,900 s of data obtained shortly before closest approach
to Pluto and detect airglow emissions from H I, N I, N II, N2, and CO above the
disk of Pluto. We ﬁnd Pluto’s brightness at Lyman-α to be 29.3 ± 1.9R, in good
agreement with pre-encounter estimates. The detection of the N II multiplet at
1085˚A marks the ﬁrst direct detection of ions in Pluto’s atmosphere. We do not
detect any emissions from noble gasses and place a 3σ upper limit of 0.14 R on
the brightness of the Ar I 1048˚A line. We compare pre-encounter model predictions
and predictions from our own airglow model, based on atmospheric proﬁles derived
from the solar occultation observed by New Horizons, to the observed brightness of
Pluto’s airglow. Although completely opaque at Lyman α, Pluto’s atmosphere is
optically thin at wavelengths longer than 1425˚A. Consequently, a signiﬁcant amount
of solar FUV light reaches the surface, where it can participate in space weathering
processes. From the brightness of sunlight reﬂected from Pluto, we ﬁnd the surface
has a reﬂectance factor (I/F) of 17% between 1400-1850˚A. We also report the ﬁrst
detection of an C3 hydrocarbon molecule, methylacetylene, in absorption, at a column
density of ∼ 5 × 1015 cm−2, corresponding to a column-integrated mixing ratio of
1.6 × 10−6.

1. INTRODUCTION

Pluto’s atmosphere was deﬁnitively discovered in 1988 by the technique of stellar
occultation (Elliot et al. 1989; Hubbard et al. 1988), but its composition was un-
known. The composition was subsequently deduced to be primarily N2 with trace
amounts of CH4 and CO, based on detection of their ices on Pluto’s surface and their
vapor pressures (Owen et al. 1993). Gaseous CH4 was later detected spectroscopically
(Young et al. 1997; Lellouch et al. 2017). As of the launch of NASA’s New Horizons
spacecraft in 2005, only upper limits had been placed on the amount of atmospheric
CO (Young et al. 2001; Bockel´ee-Morvan et al. 2001). The ﬁrst detections of gaseous
CO were claimed in 2011 (Lellouch et al. 2011; Greaves et al. 2011), and high SNR
measurements of gaseous CO and HCN were made near-in-time to the New Horizons
ﬂyby with ALMA (Lellouch et al. 2017).

Shortly after the New Horizons spacecraft’s closest approach to Pluto, the Alice
instrument observed an occultation of the sun by Pluto (Gladstone et al. 2016), while
the Radio Science Experiment (REX) observed an occultation of Earth (Hinson et al.
2017). From the solar occultation, Alice detected absorption by N2, CH4, C2H2,
C2H4, C2H6, and haze (Young et al. 2018). From the egress of the Earth occultation,
which occurred over the Sputnik Planitia region, REX found that Pluto’s atmosphere
was much colder (39 K at the surface, 65-68 K in the upper atmosphere) and more
compact than expected prior to the ﬂyby.

We report here observations of Pluto’s atmosphere and surface by the Alice far
ultraviolet (FUV) spectrograph onboard New Horizons, (Stern 2008) just prior to its
closest approach.

2. THE ALICE FUV SPECTROGRAPH

Alice is a lightweight (4.4kg), low-power (4.4W), imaging, far ultraviolet (FUV)
spectrograph (Stern et al. 2008). Sometimes referred to as “P-Alice” (for “PERSI-
Alice”, a precursor instrument design, or “Pluto-Alice”), to distinguish it from its
older sibling instrument on ESA’s Rosetta Spacecraft (Stern et al. 2007) consists an
oﬀ-axis telescope feeding a 15-cm diameter Rowland-circle spectrograph with a wave-
length range of 520-1870˚A and a Nyquist-sampled spectral resolution of 3.8˚A. The
detector is an imaging microchannel plate (MCP) shaped to match the instrument’s
Rowland circle, coupled with a double delay line readout anode that converts the
location of the charge cloud produced by the MCP into a 1024x32 (spectral x spa-
tial) element data array, the central 740x21 pixel region in the data space maps to
the illuminated area of the microchannel plate, with each of the 21 rows subtend-
ing a 0.3-degree angle on the sky (Siegmund et al. 2000). The front surface of the
MCP is coated with a KBr photocathode layer that covers the passband of roughly
520-1160˚A, a photocathode-free region covering 1160-1280˚A and a CsI photocathode
region covering 1280-1870˚A. This photocathode regime was chosen to optimize eﬃ-
ciency at the extremes of the passband while minimizing the sensitivity to photons
from the relatively bright Lyman α emission line, which, if not attenuated, would
partially overwhelm the detector electronics.

The Alice instrument has two entrance apertures, the primary 40 mm x 40 mm
square airglow aperture, co-aligned with the LORRI and Ralph instruments, and a
secondary, 1 mm diameter circular solar occultation aperture (SOCC) oﬀset by ∼90◦
to the airglow aperture and roughly co-aligned with the Radio Science Experiment
(Tyler et al. 2008) ﬁeld of view (FOV). The data analyzed here were all obtained
using the airglow aperture.

As seen from the detector, the Alice entrance slit is 6◦ long in the spatial dimension
and divided into two sections: a narrow, rectangular region referred to as the “stem”
and a wide, square region referred to as the “box”. The stem is 4◦ in angular length
along the spatial direction and 0.1◦ in the spectral dimension. The optical axis of
the instrument is located 3◦ from the bottom of the stem, on the centerline of the
0.1◦ -wide slit. The stem portion of the slit corresponds to approximately rows 6–18
(zero-indexed) in data space, with the center of data row 16 deﬁning the instrument
boresight for spacecraft pointing purposes. The box is a 2◦×2◦ angular width square,
located at the top (higher detector row numbers) of the stem. The large width of
the box was chosen so that even if there was a signiﬁcant misalignment between the
Alice solar occultation aperture and REX, both instruments would be able to simul-
taneously observe the occultations of the Sun and the Earth by Pluto’s atmosphere.

sures from the Airglow4 observation (right). The projection of the Alice entrance slit onto
the sky plane is outlined in blue. The approximately vertical, blue lines delineate the ﬁeld
of view of individual detector rows, with row 16 (zero indexed) lying on the disk of Pluto
and rows 17 and 15 to the left and right of Pluto, respectively.

The box portion of the slit corresponds to rows 19-25, with row 18 serving as the
transition between the two slit widths.

3. AIRGLOW OBSERVATIONS AND PROCESSING

On approach to Pluto, Alice made numerous observations in search of airglow emis-
sions. For our analysis, we selected data from just two separate airglow observations,
PEAL 01 PC Airglow Appr 3 and PEAL 01 PC Airglow Appr 4, hereafter Airglow3
and Airglow4. These particular observations were chosen because they are the closest,
long-duration airglow observations of Pluto and thus, presumably, the most sensitive.
Additionally, these observations have a favorable viewing geometry in which Alice
is centered on Pluto, whose disk ﬁlls >98% of the ﬁeld of view of the central row
of the detector (row 16, zero-indexed). this minimizes the possibility of confusing
emission from the interplanetary medium (IPM) with Plutogenic airglow emissions.
The adjacent detector rows, 15 and 17, are centered at a tangent altitude of ∼890 km
and cover a region from the surface to a tangent altitude of 1.6 Pluto radii. Figure 1,
produced using the web-based GeoViz tool (Throop et al. 2009), illustrates the ob-
serving geometry during the Airglow 3 & 4 observations. The instrument footprint
covers a signiﬁcant fraction of Sputnik Planitia as well as regions poleward.

Data from the Airglow3 observation consist of ten 300-second histogram exposures
obtained from 2015 July 14 03:11:26 to 2015 July 14 04:01:26 UTC. During these
exposures, the distance to Pluto spanned 427,621–386,306 km and the phase angle
increased slightly from 16.90◦to 17.09◦. We also selected six, 150-second histogram
exposures from the 18 exposures of the Airglow4 observation that covered a similar
region on Pluto as Airglow3. These Airglow4 images were obtained from 2015 July 14

and 17.51-17.60◦ in phase angle. To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio in the data,
we co-added all 16 spectra. Observational details are shown in Table 1.

We apply the standard Alice data reduction techniques of dead time correction,
stim pixel correction, and dark subtraction. These are described in more detail in
the Appendix, below. As discussed above, there is no photocathode coating on the
microchannel plate in the region around Lyman α (1216˚A). This causes the extended
wings of the line proﬁle to appear to drop to zero, increase sharply around 60 ˚A from
Lyman α (where the CsI and KBr photocathode coatings begin) and then decrease
gradually with further distance from the line center. Because Lyman α emission
line is so intrinsically bright, the extended wings of the line proﬁle are comparable
in intensity to the faint airglow emissions we are searching for–even several hundred
angstroms away from core of the line. Thus, careful removal of the scattered Lyman α
proﬁle is required.

We created a Lyman α template image by summing 38 hours of Alice observations
(PC AIRGLOW DOY, where DOY is the day of year), made on approach to Pluto
between 2015 May 29 (DOY 149) and 2015 June 18 (DOY 169). Owing to the large
distance of New Horizons to Pluto (greater than 30 million kilometers), no airglow
emissions or sunlight reﬂected from Pluto were detected in these data, and Pluto’s disk
blocks out an insigniﬁcant fraction of the ﬁeld of view. In half of these observations,
Pluto was placed at the center of the box portion of the slit and in the other half,
Pluto was placed at the instrument boresight in the stem. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences
were seen between the two pointings. IPM emission lines were detected at Lyman α
(1216˚A) and Lyman β (1026˚A) but not at He I 584˚A. The observed brightness (or
upper limit) of these lines is given in Table 2. The brightness of the IPM Lyman α
is ∼1.5× brighter than pre-encounter predictions (Gladstone et al. 2015).

Since interplanetary Lyman β emission is ∼500x fainter than Lyman α emission,
the extended wings of its line proﬁle are not signiﬁcant. To prevent the unintentional
subtraction of the IPM Lyman β signal from the Pluto observations, we ﬁt a Gaus-

sian line proﬁle with a linear background, to the IPM spectrum around 1026˚A and
subtract oﬀ the Gaussian component. The resulting template image contains only
interplanetary Lyman α and detector dark counts. We remove these dark counts by
subtracting a composite “dark” image, obtained while the airglow aperture door was
closed. The spectrum of these dark counts can be seen in the blue line of Figure 2.
After subtracting the scaled dark image from the Pluto observations, we normalize
the IPM Lyman α template to the brightness of the Lyman α emission in the Pluto
data.

Due to the slight misalignment of the Alice detector and the optical axes of the
spectrograph, emissions that are centered in a given detector row at short wavelengths
will partially spill over onto the next lower detector row for wavelengths greater than
∼1570˚A. We therefore extract the airglow spectrum from row 16 and add the spectrum
of row 15 to it for λ > 1570˚A. The resulting uncalibrated spectrum of Pluto is shown
in Figure 2. We divide by the instrument’s eﬀective area curve and by the solid angle
of the sky as seen by a single detector row (0.3◦ spatial along the slit by 0.1◦ across
it) to calibrate the spectrum in units of radiance.

4. PLUTO’S ATMOSPHERIC TRANSMISSION AND SURFACE
REFLECTANCE

The observed spectral radiance of Pluto over the Alice passband is shown in Figure 3.
The central spectral feature is the Lyman α airglow at 1216˚A. Since the disk of
Pluto completely ﬁlls the FOV of the central row during this observation, there is no
contribution from the IPM. Faint airglow emission features arising from molecular,
atomic and ionized species (e.g., N2 CY(0,1) 980˚A, N I 1493˚A, and N II 1085˚A) are
present in the spectrum and are discussed in Section 5, below.

At wavelengths greater than ∼1500˚A, Pluto’s spectrum is dominated by sunlight
passing through the atmosphere and reﬂecting oﬀ the surface. Scattering of sunlight
by atmospheric haze particles 100-200 km above the surface may also contribute a
small amount to the observed spectrum at these wavelengths. For our purposes, the
reﬂected/scattered solar light serves as an additional source of background that poten-
tially obscures fainter airglow emissions in this region of the spectrum. We therefore

attempt to remove the solar contribution by constructing a simple model of Pluto’s
atmospheric transmission and surface reﬂectance, based on the solar occultation pro-
ﬁles of Pluto’s atmosphere (Young et al. 2018).

4.1. Atmospheric Transmission

The ingress and egress solar occultation proﬁles reported by Young et al. (2018) are
largely similar. To increase the signal-to-noise in our analysis, we averaged the two
occultation proﬁles together and re-binned the data to 25 km vertical resolution. We
used this proﬁle to reproduce the results of Young et al. (2018). Pluto’s hazes are
complex (Cheng et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017; Krasnopolsky 2020), and we do not
attempt to derive a column density directly from the occultation proﬁles. Rather,
following Young et al. (2018), we treat the haze as a spectrally-neutral source of atmo-
spheric opacity in our ﬁts to the solar occultation transmission spectrum. For compar-
ison with other atmospheric constituents, we assume a wavelength-independent haze
cross section of 1×10−15 cm2. With the additional assumption of spherical symmetry
(reasonable, given the similarity of the ingress and egress proﬁles) we can apply the

and a scattered Lyman α proﬁle have been subtracted from the data. The dramatic increase
in ﬂux at the long wavelength end of the spectrum is the result of sunlight reﬂected from
the surface of Pluto with a small contribution from sunlight scattered by atmospheric haze
particles.

where n(r) is the number density of a given species at radial distance, r, from Pluto
and N (r(cid:48)) is the column density of that species at a tangent radius, r(cid:48). The resulting
atmospheric proﬁles are shown in Figure 4, which is broadly similar to Figure 17 of
Young et al. (2018).

As shown in Figure 1, the Alice ﬁeld of view covered a signiﬁcant fraction of the disk
of Pluto during the Airglow 3 and 4 observations, and as such covers a large range
of solar incidence and emission angles. Therefore, we divided the ﬁeld of view of the
central detector row (row 16, zero-indexed) into a grid of 31x11 lines-of-sight, sepa-
rated by 0.01◦ (corresponding to a separation of roughly 70 km on Pluto’s surface),
and calculated the atmospheric absorption and surface reﬂection along each line of
sight. Averaged over the Alice ﬁeld-of-view, the solar incidence angle is 36.2◦, while
the average emission angle is 33.3◦. We integrate the atmospheric proﬁles shown in
Fig. 4 along the path from the sun to the surface and then from the surface to Alice
for each of the 341 lines-of-sight. The two-way atmospheric transmission, averaged

over the Alice ﬁeld of view, is shown in the top panel of Figure 5, while the one-way
vertical atmospheric transmission is shown in the bottom panel (cf. Figure 12 of
Young et al. (2018)).

Pluto’s atmosphere is completely opaque at wavelengths below 1400˚A, largely due
to absorption by methane (CH4). However, the absorption cross-section of methane
decreases by more than four orders of magnitude between 1400 ˚A and 1500 ˚A, which
results in the vertical optical depth of the atmosphere, τv, being less than one for
λ > 1425 ˚A. Acetylene (C2H2) is the primary atmospheric absorber between 1430-
1530 ˚A, while at wavelengths greater than 1530 ˚A, the atmospheric transmission is
controlled by both haze particles and ethylene (C2H4).

As shown in the bottom panel of Figure 5 photons with λ > 1425˚A readily pass
through the atmosphere and interact with Pluto’s surface (i.e. τv < 1). These photons
have only ∼25% less energy than Lyman α photons–enough to break molecular bonds
and drive photolysis. (Olkin et al. 2017) report that Pluto’s equatorial regions, which
receive greater insolation when averaged over Pluto’s orbit, are darker and redder
than the poles, which are brighter and more neutral in color. They propose that this
surface color distribution could be produced by the transport of volatiles away from
the warmer equator towards the colder poles. We suggest that in addition to this

mechanism, longer-wavelength FUV photons photolyze tholins and haze particles on
the surface, further reddening the equatorial regions.

The reﬂectance factor, sometimes referred to as I/F, is deﬁned as:

I/F (λ) =

πhcI(λ, φ)r2
µ0ΩF(cid:12)(λ)

(2)

where h is Planck’s constant; c is the speed of light; I is the observed spectral intensity
in photons s−1 cm−2 ˚A−1 as a function of wavelength, λ, at a given solar phase angle,
φ; r is the heliocentric distance of Pluto in AU; µ0 is the cosine of the solar incidence
angle, averaged over the ﬁeld of view; Ω = 9.1 × 10−6 Sr is the solid angle subtended
by a single row of the Alice detector; and F(cid:12) is the solar ﬂux at 1 AU. After proper
calibration, I(λ, φ) is what is actually measured by Alice. We use the same F(cid:12)(λ) as
in Young et al. (2018), which was assembled from SUMER reference spectra (Curdt
et al. 2001) and observations from TIMED/SEE (Woods et al. 2005).

Figure 6. The observed spectral radiance of Pluto and solar spectra with various combi-
nations of surface reﬂectance and atmospheric absorption. The spectral radiance observed
by Alice is shown in black, with 1σ error bars shown for every other point. If Pluto had
no atmosphere and a surface reﬂectance of 100%, Alice would observe the blue curve. In-
cluding absorption by the Young et al. (2018) atmosphere yields the green curve, while also
reducing the surface reﬂectance to 17% produces the red curve–a surprisingly good match
to the data for wavelengths longer than 1580˚A. Between 1530-1580˚A, there is an additional
source/sources of absorption of the solar spectrum not included in Young et al. (2018)
that results in an over-subtraction of the solar spectrum. Including absorption by methy-
lacetylene (C3H4 or propyne) with a 2-way column density of ∼ 5 × 1015 cm−2 signiﬁcantly
improves the model ﬁt between 1535–1550˚A.

In the absence of an atmosphere and with a surface reﬂectance factor of 100%, the
spectral radiance of Pluto would be about an order of magnitude greater than what is
observed, as shown with the blue curve of Figure 6. Including the 2-way atmospheric
transmission shown in Fig. 5 reduces our model spectral radiance to about 6× what is
observed at long wavelengths. Combining this with a wavelength-independent surface
reﬂectance factor of 17% yields a surprisingly good match to the observed radiance of
Pluto at wavelengths greater than ∼1570˚A. Notably, the feature at 1657˚A appears to
be entirely due to the reﬂected/scattered solar C I multiplet and not airglow emission
from Pluto’s atmosphere.

Compared to other planetary surfaces, an FUV I/F of 17% is relatively high. For
example, comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has an I/F of just 1-2% (Stern et al.
2015); Saturn’s moon, Phoebe, has a reﬂectance between 1-3% (Hendrix & Hansen
2008); while the Moon’s I/F varies between 2-10% (Gladstone et al. 2012).

Steffl et al.

As discussed above, Pluto’s atmospheric haze was treated simply as a source of
extinction. In reality, haze particles will both scatter and absorb sunlight. Therefore,
the 17% surface I/F value should really be thought of as an upper limit. Modeling
the properties of Pluto’s atmospheric haze is well beyond the scope of this paper.
However, as an end-member case, if we assume the haze particles are simple 0.2µm
spheres with a single scattering albedo of 0.55 at 1500˚A, Mie scattering theory predicts
that the haze will be roughly half absorbing and half scattering and that the scattering
should be roughly independent with wavelength over the Alice pass band. If we then
assume that as much sunlight is scattered back into our line-of-sight as out of it, a
surface I/F value of 13% is required to match the Alice observations. We suggest that
a more detailed analysis of Pluto’s ultraviolet surface reﬂectance, properly accounting
for atmospheric haze, is a fruitful area for subsequent work.

4.3. Methylacetylene

While the overall match between the Alice observations and our simple transmis-
sion/reﬂectance model is fairly good, as shown in Fig. 6, our simple model predicts
signiﬁcantly more ﬂux than is observed between 1535–1570˚A, resulting in an over-
subtraction of the solar spectrum. This suggests that either the atmosphere or surface
has one or more additional sources of opacity/absorption. However, FUV absorption
features from solids tend to be very broad, on the order of 100’s of ˚Angstroms (Wagner
et al. 1987). Likewise, we are not aware of any mechanism by which atmospheric haze
can produce such relatively narrow absorption features. Thus, we favor the interpre-
tation that one or more additional gaseous species are present in Pluto’s atmosphere
at high-enough column densities to signiﬁcantly absorb sunlight passing through the
atmosphere.

We examined the absorption cross sections of 32 additional atomic and molecular
species that might plausibly be found in Pluto’s atmosphere (C, CH3, CH4O, C2H,
C2H5, C3H3, C3H4 (both the allene and methylacetylene isomers), C3H6 (both the
propene and cyclopropane isomers), C3H8, C4H2, C4H4, C6H6, CO, CO2, H, H2,
H2CO, H2O, H2O2, HCN, HC3N, HNCO, N, NH3, O, O2, O3, OCS, PH3, SO, and
SO2), and found that, among them, only methylacetylene (H3C−C≡CH, or propyne),
has both a strong absorption band in this region and a lack of strong absorption bands
at longer wavelengths, where no additional absorption is seen. Methylacetylene has
been observed in the upper atmospheres of both Titan, where it can reach local mixing
ratios of up to 10−5 (Li et al. 2015), and Jupiter, where it is part of an important
chemical pathway in the production of acetylene (C2H2) (Gladstone et al. 1996). The
Pluto photochemical model of Wong et al. (2017) predicts a methylacetylene column
density of 2.5 × 1015 cm2 along our two-path line-of-sight. Including methylacetylene
in our model at twice this value (5 × 1015 cm−2; corresponding to a column-integrated
mixing ratio of 1.6 × 10−6) produces a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt around 1540˚A, as shown
in Figure 6.

Pluto’s Airglow Emissions

If absorption of reﬂected sunlight by methylacetylene is detectable in the airglow
observations, it should also be evident in the solar occultation observed by Alice.
Careful re-examination of the solar occultation proﬁles described by Young et al.
(2018) over a range of tangent altitudes from 100-150 km shows a previously-unnoticed
absorption feature at 1540˚A, consistent with methylacetylene. Our preliminary re-
analysis yields a methylacetylene column density of 1.5 × 1015 cm−2 along this line
of sight. Since the analysis of the solar occultation observations involves only the
transmission of sunlight through Pluto’s atmosphere and we directly measure the
unocculted solar spectrum, we can exclude the possibilities that this feature is caused
by something in Pluto’s surface reﬂectance spectrum or the solar spectrum itself. We
therefore claim the ﬁrst detection of a C3-hydrocarbon in Pluto’s atmosphere and
suggest that an additional, yet-unidentiﬁed, atmospheric species is responsible for
the apparent absorption features at 1530˚A and 1570˚A. The level of methylacetylene
should provide an important constraint for future photochemical models of Pluto’s
atmosphere.

5. PLUTO’S AIRGLOW EMISSIONS

Pluto’s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) airglow spectrum is shown in Figure 7 and its far
ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum, after subtracting the reﬂected solar spectrum, is shown in
Figure 8. (We loosely deﬁne the EUV region as wavelengths shorter than Lyman-α at
1216˚A and the FUV as longer than Lyman-α but shorter than 2000˚A.) Although the
signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is relatively low throughout much of the band-
pass, (observed count rates are generally on the order of 1 count/pixel/100 seconds),
faint emission features from H I, N II, N I, N2, and CO are detected at brightnesses of
a few tenths of a Rayleigh ( 106
4π photons s−1 cm−2 sr−1). We discuss individual species
in further detail in the subsections below.

To aid the identiﬁcation of these features, we compare the observed airglow spec-
trum to a model spectrum produced by a version of the Atmospheric Ultraviolet
Radiance Integrated Code (AURIC) (Strickland et al. 1999; Stevens et al. 2011, 2015;
Evans et al. 2015) adapted to Pluto. AURIC generates emission spectra from multiple
species as a function of viewing direction. In particular, it calculates emissions from
solar ﬂuorescence, electron impact, photoionization, photodissociation, and recombi-
nation and then propagates these emissions through a radiative transfer model of the
atmosphere of interest. We generate emission spectra over the 800-2000˚A bandpass.
Since the Alice slit covers a signiﬁcant fraction of the disk of Pluto, as discussed in
Sec. 4.1, we average the model output over an evenly-spaced grid of 341 lines of sight,
separated by 0.01◦ (∼70 km projected on the surface). We start with the atmosphere
of Young et al. (2018), as shown in Fig. 4 and add CO at a surface mixing ratio of
5.0×10−4 (Lellouch et al. 2017), assuming that, like the rest of the atmosphere, it is
in gravitational diﬀusive equilibrium.

Figure 7. EUV airglow spectrum of Pluto. For clarity, every other error bar is plotted,
representing the 1σ statistical uncertainty. At these wavelengths, Plutos atmosphere is
opaque, and no reﬂected sunlight is present in the spectrum. Emissions from N2, N II, N I,
and H I, are clearly detected. Notably absent are emission lines from argon at 1048˚A and
1067˚A. The orange curve is a synthetic spectrum produced by our AURIC model using the
atmospheric proﬁles of Young et al. (2018) combined with surface mixing ratios of 5.0×10−4
for CO and 1.5×10−4 for Ar I. Our model does not include emissions from hydrogen. The
elevated brightness between 1160–1190˚A is likely an artifact of the Lyman-α background
subtraction.

AURIC produces synthetic spectra for molecular emission band systems and indi-
vidual atomic species. For this paper, we did not vary the model’s input parameters
in an attempt to ﬁt the observed airglow spectrum in a fully self-consistent manner.
Such work will be the subject of a future publication. However, recent analyses of the
atmospheres of Mars and Titan using AURIC (Stevens et al. 2015; Jain et al. 2015;
Schneider et al. 2015; Stevens et al. 2017), have shown that weighting each of the
individual component spectra can result in a markedly better match to the data. We
use a multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithm to determine the weights for each
component spectrum:

a source of additional absorption in Pluto’s atmosphere or surface that is not included in
our background model, resulting in an over-subtraction of the reﬂected solar spectrum (see
Sec. 4). This region, shaded in gray, is excluded from further analysis.

Steffl et al.

Our model spectrum is a reasonably good match to the observations, as can be seen
in Figures 7 and 8. All of the detectable emission features predicted by our model
are either present in, or at least consistent with, the observed airglow spectrum.
Conversely, there are no signiﬁcant emission features predicted by our model that
are clearly missing from the observed spectrum. On the other hand, there are several
features in the observed spectrum that appear to be statistically signiﬁcant but do not
appear in our model. These are are likely either instrumental artifacts or systematic
eﬀects of our data processing, and they are discussed in further detail in Section 5.7,
below.

From the results of our AURIC model, we claim the detection (> 4σ likelihood) of
the N2 LBH and CO 4PG bands. With a 2σ level of conﬁdence, we also plausibly
detect emissions from the N2 VK bands, the brightest of which is predicted to be the
(7,0) band at 1689˚A. However, we advise caution in interpreting the CO HB bands as
a (∼2σ) “detection”. This band system in the EUV is quite faint (<0.2 R, integrated
over the entire instrument bandpass), and while including it in the model does result
in a statistically better ﬁt, none of the predicted CO HB emissions (the brightest
of which occur at 1151˚A and 1124˚A) are particularly compelling. We attempted to
include the Birge-Hopﬁeld-1 band system of N2 and Cameron band system of CO in
our MLR model, but found that these band systems were not suﬃciently constrained
by our data.

We detect airlow emissions from H I at both Lyman α and Lyman β and derive the
amount of hydrogen above the τ = 1 altitude in Section 5.1, below. Although this is an
important constraint, we cannot measure the vertical proﬁle of hydrogen in Pluto’s
atmosphere from the Alice data or from any other currently existing observations.
Since hydrogen is produced and destroyed by a large number of reactions in Pluto’s
atmosphere and developing a full photochemical model is well beyond the scope of this
observational paper, we do not include it in our AURIC model atmosphere. As neither
H nor H2 are a signiﬁcant source of atmospheric opacity –at least for any physically
reasonable amount of hydrogen–this omission does not aﬀect the interpretation of
other airglow spectral features.

In the EUV region of the spectrum, the airglow emission features are well-separated
(see Fig 7). To determine their brightness (or upper limits), we ﬁt a Gaussian line
proﬁle plus a linear background to each feature. The width of the Gaussian proﬁle
was held constant to match the line function of the instrument for a ﬁlled slit (Stern
et al. 2008) . The area under the ﬁtted Gaussian proﬁle (or the 3σ uncertainty thereof,
in the case of a non-detection) is given in Table 4, along with model predictions from
Summers et al. (1997), Stern et al. (2008), Young et al. (2008), Stevens et al. (2013),
Jain & Bhardwaj (2015), and our MLR-weighted AURIC model.

The situation is more complicated in the FUV, as Pluto’s atmosphere transitions
from completely opaque for wavelengths below 1400˚A to τ < 1 for λ >1540˚A. Sun-
light, reﬂected from the surface, overwhelms the faint airglow emissions at wavelengths

Pluto’s Airglow Emissions

17

greater than ∼1400˚A. Section 4 describes how we model the reﬂected sunlight and
subtract it from the data. However, there appears to be an additional source of ab-
sorption in Pluto’s atmosphere between 1500˚A< λ <1580˚A that is missing from our
model. This results in an over-subtraction of the solar spectrum, as can clearly be
seen in Figure 8. We therefore exclude this region from all subsequent analysis.

In addition, at the spectral resolution of Alice, emissions from the N2 LBH bands,
the CO 4PG bands, N I, and the N2 Vegard-Kaplan (VK) bands (in blue, green,

separate these components observationally and do not have full conﬁdence–at the
level of individual spectral features–in the relative intensities predicted by our MLR
model ﬁt to the data, we report only the total brightness of each spectral feature.

5.1. Hydrogen
The bright emission line at Lyman α (1216˚A) indicates that atomic hydrogen is
present in Pluto’s upper atmosphere–a result of methane photochemistry. We ﬁnd
a Lyman α brightness of 29.3 ± 1.9 R, which matches the pre-encounter predictions
by Gladstone et al. (2015) that relied on the model atmosphere of Krasnopolsky
& Cruikshank (1999). The H I Lyman β emission line at 1026˚A was also detected,
though ∼ 150× fainter than Lyman α. Since the Lyman α emission line is optically
thick in Pluto’s atmosphere, we use the brightness, B (in units of Rayleighs), of the
optically thin Lyman β line to estimate the hydrogen column density above the τ = 1
level:

B = 10−6gikN

altitude of 490 km,.

Resonant scattering of the EUV solar continuum by argon produces emission lines
at 1048˚A and 1067˚A, well within the bandpass of Alice. Little is known about the

5.2. Argon

Pluto’s Airglow Emissions

19

relative abundance of argon in Pluto’s atmosphere or other objects in the Kuiper
belt. Early observations of the atmosphere of Saturn’s moon, Titan, by Voyager
IRIS placed an upper limit on the mixing ratio of argon at 6% (Courtin et al. 1995).
This led Summers et al. (1997) to include argon at a constant mixing ratio of 5% in
their Pluto atmospheric models, resulting in a predicted brightness of the Ar I 1048˚A
line of 0.3 R. More recently, Using the Krasnopolsky & Cruikshank (1999) “Model
2” atmospheric proﬁle and an altitude-independent argon mixing ratio of 5%, Stern
et al. (2008) predicted 0.45 R, and more recently, Mousis et al. (2013) predicted a
brightness of 1.3 R–levels that should be detectable by New Horizons’ Alice. However,
subsequent in situ measurements of Titan’s atmosphere by the Huygens probe gas
chromatograph mass spectrometer reduced the Voyager-era upper limit on the mixing
ratio of argon by more than three orders of magnitude to just 3.39 ± 0.12 × 10−5
(Niemann et al. 2010). The ultraviolet spectrograph on Cassini, UVIS, also failed to
detect any emission from argon at Titan (Stevens et al. 2011), calling into question
whether Alice would detect argon emission at Pluto.

Pre-ﬂyby models of Pluto’s atmosphere that predicted detectable argon emission
lines generally assumed a relatively warm, well-mixed atmosphere.
Instead, New
Horizons found an atmosphere that is considerably colder (a peak temperature of
106 K at 25 km altitude, falling to a nearly constant temperature of 68 K in the upper
atmosphere) (Gladstone et al. 2016). At present, there are extreme discrepancies
between various models of Pluto’s atmosphere. The model atmosphere of Young
et al. (2018) has a very small eddy diﬀusion coeﬃcient, resulting in an atmosphere
with the well-mixed portion restricted to the planetary boundary layer (surface to
2 km). Above that, their atmosphere is in gravitational diﬀusive equilibrium.
In
contrast, the model atmosphere of Luspay-Kuti et al. (2017) has a much larger eddy
diﬀusion coeﬃcient, such that argon does not diﬀusively separate until an altitude of
approximately 400 km.

We do not detect either argon emission line in the Alice data. We place a 3σ upper
limit of 0.14 R on the brightness of the Ar I 1048˚A line and 0.21 R on the Ar I 1067˚A
line. At these wavelengths, methane is the primary source of atmospheric opacity.
For a CH4 absorption cross section of 3.2 × 10−17 cm2 at 1048˚A (Kameta et al. 2002;
Chen & Wu 2004), an optical depth of τ = 1 is reached at a column density of
NCH4 = 3.1 × 1016 cm−2. Averaged over the ﬁeld of view, this occurs at an altitude
of 480 km above Pluto’s surface (Young et al. 2018).

The g-factor for the Ar I 1048˚A line at a heliocentric distance of 32.9 AU is 7.6×10−11
photons s−1. Thus, to produce our 3σ upper limit of 0.14 R of Ar I 1048˚A requires an
Ar column density of 1.8 × 1015 cm−2 above the τ = 1 level. This is roughly 6% of the
column of density of methane. For atmospheric models that use a small eddy diﬀusion
coeﬃcient (e.g. Strobel & Zhu (2017); Young et al. (2018)), the Alice detection limit
isn’t signiﬁcant, as even if the density of argon and (molecular) nitrogen were equal
at Pluto’s surface, you would still expect brightness of the Ar I 1048˚A line to be

20

Steffl et al.

<< 0.14 R. For atmospheric models with high eddy diﬀusion coeﬃcients, such as
Luspay-Kuti et al. (2017), the Alice results could be more physically meaningful.

5.3. N I

Several multiplets from atomic nitrogen are present in the airglow spectrum. The
brightest of these occurs in the FUV at 1493˚A, although this feature is blended with
the CO fourth positive (3,1) band and the N2 LBH (3,3) band. The EUV multiplets at
1200˚A and 1134˚A are also signiﬁcant. The observed N I 1200˚A multiplet is somewhat
brighter than our AURIC model predicts. However, its proximity to the much brighter
H I 1216˚A emission line (and resulting scattered light results) in a low signal-to-noise
ratio for this multiplet. Although this emission feature appears to be real, it is only
present at the 1σ level of signiﬁcance.

5.4. N II
One of the brighter features in Pluto’s EUV airglow spectrum is the N II 1085˚A
multiplet. This multiplet is produced primarily by the dissociative photoionization
of molecular nitrogen by solar EUV and X-ray photons via excitation of the H band
of N+

2 (Samson et al. 1991; Bishop & Feldman 2003):

N2 + γλ<340˚A → N (4S) + N +2s2p3(3D0)
This N II 1085˚A multiplet was also detected at both Triton (Broadfoot et al. 1989) and
Titan (Stevens et al. 2011). The detection here marks the ﬁrst, and thus far only,
detection of ions in Pluto’s atmosphere (although the in situ instruments SWAP
and PEPSSI measured ions escaping from Pluto’s atmosphere (Bagenal et al. 2016)).
Although this multiplet provides a direct detection of ion production in Pluto’s upper
atmosphere, because it is a consequence of the dissociation of N2 rather than the
excitation of an existing ion, it cannot be used as a diagnostic of the ambient ion
density.

(0,1) band–an electronic transition. Although the CY (0,0) band is strongly excited
by photoelectrons and its emission was predicted by Young et al. (2008) and Stern
et al. (2008), it was not detected. This is because the CY (0,0) band is optically thick
and strongly self-absorbed. After multiple scattering, much of the energy is ultimately
radiated away via the optically thin CY (0,1) band (Stevens et al. 1994; Stevens 2001).
Both the Voyager UVS at Triton (Broadfoot et al. 1989) and the Cassini UVIS at
Titan (Ajello et al. 2007; Stevens et al. 2011, 2013) detected the CY (0,1) band but

emission is found to be 0.4 R, which is close to what is observed and included in
Table 4.

In addition to the CY (0,1) band, emissions at several of the LBH (a1Πg—X 1Σ+
g )
bands of N2 are present in the spectrum at wavelengths greater than 1300˚A (see
Fig 8). Among these, the LBH (4,0), (3,0), and (2,0) bands at 1325˚A, 1354˚A, and
1383˚A, respectively, are predicted to be the brightest. These features are present in
the Pluto airglow spectrum, although at fairly low signal-to-noise levels. Many of the
N2 LBH bands overlap emissions from the CO fourth positive bands.

The N2 Vegard-Kaplan (VK) bands (A3Σ+

g ) should also be present and
marginally detectable in the airglow spectrum of Pluto at wavelengths greater than
1600˚A. In the Alice bandpass, the brightest of these should be the (7,0) band at
1689˚A. There appears to be a weak emission feature at this location. Other bands of
the VK system are either too faint or too blended with other emissions to be clearly
detected.

u –X 1Σ+

5.6. Carbon Monoxide

Just one month prior to the New Horizons ﬂyby of Pluto, Lellouch et al. (2017)
observed Pluto with the ALMA interferometer. They report the detection of CO
in Pluto’s atmosphere at a mole fraction of 515 ± 40 ppm, i.e, a surface mixing
ratio of ∼ 5 × 10−4. At this concentration, several of the bands of the CO fourth
positive system (A1Π—X 1Σ+) should be detectable by Alice, although they will be
blended with the N2 LBH and VK bands. Almost all of the CO fourth positive bands
are optically thick, requiring careful modeling of radiative transfer eﬀects to extract
column density from the observed brightness. Due to the saturation of the bands of
the CO fourth positive group, Alice is not very sensitive to changes in CO column
density. For example, our modeling with AURIC suggests that doubling the surface
mixing ratio of CO leads to only a ∼10% increase in the brightest CO fourth positive
bands.

Given that, our model predicts the brightest CO emission features to be the (0,1),
(0,2), (0,3), and (5,1) bands at 1597˚A, 1653˚A, 1712˚A, and 1435˚A, respectively, as
shown in Fig 8. The ﬁrst three of these bands are produced by the solar C IV 1548˚A
emission line exciting the nearby CO (0,0) band at 1544˚A. Due to the large optical
depth of the (0,0) band, much of this energy is radiated away via the (0,1), (0,2), and
(0,3) bands. Similarly, the solar Si IV emission line at 1393.8˚A pumps the CO (5,0)
band at 1391.1˚Aand because of optical depth eﬀects, this energy is primarily radiated
away through the (5,1) band at 1435˚A.

5.7. Other Features

22

Steffl et al.

None of the features below 920˚A are statistically signiﬁcant. In particular, we do not
detect any emission at He I 584˚A and place a 3σ upper limit of 0.49 R on the brightness
of this emission line. Although there appears to be a 2σ signiﬁcant emission feature
at 736˚A, this is a known instrumental artifact (a Lyman-α ghost) and not emission
from Ne I.

Between 1160-1180˚A, our airglow spectrum is signiﬁcantly elevated above the back-
ground level. This feature is too wide to be due to a single emission line or band,
and none of the species that have been detected in Pluto’s atmosphere emit signiﬁ-
cantly in this bandpass. Nor are we aware of any ions/atoms/molecules that might
plausibly contribute to these putative emissions while producing no other detectable
UV signature. We therefore believe this feature is likely an artifact of or our data
processing.

Similarly, there are several features in the FUV that appear to be signiﬁcant at
about the 2σ level, yet do not correspond to the wavelength or predicted intensity of
any known emissions. Examples include the feature at 1412˚A, which is both longward
of the CO Fourth Positive (6,1) band and shortward of the N2 LBH (1,0) band, and
the feature at 1449˚A, which could plausibly be the CO Fourth Positive (3,0) band,
except that our AURIC model predicts the (3,0) band should be undetectably faint.
There are several other potential features in Figure 8 at wavelengths greater than
1600˚A. Given the 1σ statistical error bars, several of these appear to be real. However,
systematic errors introduced by our subtraction of the solar spectrum after modeling
the atmospheric absorption and surface reﬂectance are likely much greater than the
statistical uncertainty. We therefore urge caution in interpreting these features.

6. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF AIRGLOW EMISSIONS

From the left-hand panel of Figure 1, the geometry of the Airglow3 observations is
such that while the ﬁeld of view of detector row 16 lies almost entirely on the disk of
Pluto, rows 15 and 17 (zero-indexed) lie almost entirely oﬀ the limb, spanning a range
of tangent altitudes from 0-1920 km (0–1.6 Pluto radii). No airglow emissions were
detected in either of these rows. We suggest this is a consequence of gravitational dif-
fusion and limb darkening. Methane (CH4) is the dominant absorber below ∼1450˚A.
Because of its low molecular weight, it has a larger scale height than most other
atmospheric species. As a result, there is considerably less of these heavier species
between New Horizons and the τ = 1 level in Pluto’s atmosphere along the tangential
line of sight. For example, using the Young et al. (2018) atmospheric model, shown in
Figure 4, the column density of N2 above the τ = 1 level at the LBH bands is ∼3.5×
lower for rows 15 and 17 than it is for row 16. This decrease in apparent column
density renders the already faint emission lines below our detection threshold.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The main conclusions of our paper are as follows:

Pluto’s Airglow Emissions

23

1. The brightness of IPM Lyman α at a heliocentric distance of 32.5 AU in the
direction of Pluto (α=18h2m38.7s, δ = -14◦37(cid:48)37.(cid:48)(cid:48)2), as seen from the New
Horizons spacecraft is 133.4 ± 0.6 R. Lyman β has a brightness of 0.24 ± 0.02 R,
and we place a 3σ upper limit of 0.10 R on the brightness of He I 584˚A.

2. Although Pluto’s atmosphere is completely opaque at Lyman α, it is optically
thin (τv < 1) for photons with λ > 1425 ˚A. These FUV photons can break
molecular bonds and drive photolysis on the surface. We suggest this has im-
portant consequences for surface weathering and could explain why the areas
on Pluto that receive the most insolation, averaged over its orbit, are darker
and redder than the poles.

3. Pluto’s surface reﬂectance between 1400-1850˚A is approximately wavelength-
independent with an I/F of 0.17. This is the ﬁrst measurement of Pluto’s
reﬂectance in the FUV.

4. We detected a new species in Pluto’s atmosphere in absorption: methylacety-
lene (C3H4, or propyne). In our observations, methylacetylene has a column
density of approximately 5 × 1015 cm−2, corresponding to a column-integrated
mixing ratio of 1.6 × 10−6. This could provide an important constraint for
photochemical models of Pluto’s atmosphere.

5. We have detected airglow emissions from N2, N I, N II, H I, and CO in Pluto’s
upper atmosphere. Detected emissions range in brightness from a few tenths of
a Rayleigh to 29.3 ± 1.9 R for Lyman α.

6. The discovery of the N II multiplet at 1085˚A is the ﬁrst direct detection of ions
in Pluto’s atmosphere. However, since this multiplet results from the prompt
emission of N II after the dissociative photoionization of N2, it is not diagnostic
of ionospheric density.

We suggest several areas ripe for future work. First, we examined only the most
promising subset of the Alice airglow observations, selected for their relatively long
integration time and proximity to Pluto. Second, more of the solar spectrum is
absorbed by Pluto’s atmosphere/surface between 1500–1580˚A than we can account
for in our modeling. Following our discovery of methylacetylene, we suggest that it
is likely there are one or more additional minor species in Pluto’s atmosphere that
have not yet been identiﬁed. Third, in our modeling, we have neglected the physics of
Pluto’s haze particles, which are complex and likely to vary with altitude. A careful
treatment of Pluto’s atmospheric haze is required to improve upon our upper limit
of Pluto’s surface reﬂectance. Finally, although our atmospheric model produces
a reasonable match to Pluto’s observed airglow spectrum, there is signiﬁcant room
for improvement. A careful treatment of the radiative transfer eﬀects of emissions
and absorption by multiple hydrocarbon species along the line of sight could yield a
signiﬁcantly better match to the observations.

APPENDIX

A. DATA REDUCTION

In this appendix, we discuss the data reduction techniques described in Section 3
in more detail. The ﬁrst data reduction step is to correct for the dead time of the
detector, for each of the individual exposures. This correction is necessary because
the detector electronics take a ﬁnite amount of time to process each detected count,
during which the detector is “dead”, i.e.
it is insensitive to any additional counts.
Thus, each detected count is weighted by a factor of 1/(1 − τ C), where τ =18 µs is the
time constant of the electronics and C is the average count rate during the exposure
(Stern et al. 2008).

After the dead time correction we then use the “stim pixels” to correct the location
of the spectrum in data space (Stern et al. 2008). Unlike many classes of detectors
such as (CCDs), the Alice detector does not have any physical pixels. Instead, when
an ultraviolet photon strikes the front surface of the MCP, it produces a photoelectron.
As the front and back surfaces of the MCP are held at an electric potential of several
thousand volts, the electron is accelerated into the pores of the microchannel plate,
where it strikes the walls, liberating more electrons. The resulting cascade produces a
cloud of ∼6 million electrons (∼1 pC of charge) exiting the back surface of the MCP,
which then strikes the readout anode. The detector electronics compares the times
when the charge pulse is detected on one side of the readout anode to when the signal
is detected on the other side of the anode, after traveling through a delay circuit.
The diﬀerence in timing determines how the event is mapped from physical space on
the readout anode to data space. Changes in temperature aﬀect the resistivity of the
readout anode, which, in turn, aﬀects the relative timing of the charge pulses. Thus,

Pluto’s Airglow Emissions

25

an event that occurs at the same physical location can be mapped into a diﬀerent
location in data space, depending on temperature. To correct for this, the electronics
produces artiﬁcial charge pulses at known physical locations on opposite sides of the
detector, which allows for a linear correction to the apparent location of detected
photons.

After applying the dead time correction factor and the stim pixel correction we co-
add all the data and divide by the total exposure time of 3,900 s. We then subtract
a dark countrate image from the data. The dark countrate image was produced by
summing Alice images acquired with the airglow aperture door closed and dividing
by the total integration time. In total, 10,720 seconds of dark integration time was
obtained during Active Checkout 8 in July 2014 and 10,800 seconds of dark inte-
gration time was acquired during the post-encounter calibration campaign of July
2016. Typical dark count rates are of the order of 0.004 counts s−1 px−1 and show no
evidence of temporal change.
