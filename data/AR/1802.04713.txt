The exclusive ρ, ω and J/Ψ photoproduction in ﬁxed - target collisions at the LHC is investigated.
We estimate, for the ﬁrst time, the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the vector
meson photoproduction in pHe, pAr, P bHe and P bAr ﬁxed - target collisions at the LHC using
the STARlight Monte Carlo and present our results for the total cross sections. Predictions for the
kinematical range probed by the LHCb detector are also presented. Our results indicate that the
experimental analysis of this process in ﬁxed - target collisions at the LHC is feasible. Such future
analysis will probe the QCD dynamics in a kinematical range complementary to that studied in the
collider mode.

INTRODUCTION

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN started high energy collisions nine years ago. During this period a
large amount of data have been collected considering pp collisions at √s = 0.9, 2.76, 7, 8 and 13 TeV, pP b collisions
at √s = 5 and 8.2 TeV as well as P bP b collisions at √s = 2.76 and 5 TeV. Currently, there is a great expectation that
LHC will discover new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions. However,
we should remember that one of the main contributions of the LHC is that it probes a new kinematical regime at high
energy, where several questions related to the description of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) remain without
satisfactory answers. In particular, the study of the photon - induced interactions in hadronic collisions at the LHC
[1, 2] is expected to constrain the nuclear and nucleon gluon distributions [3] and the description of the QCD dynamics
at high energies [4], where a hadron becomes a dense system and the nonlinear eﬀects inherent to the QCD dynamics
may become visible [5]. During the last years, the study of these interactions in pp/pA/AA collisions [1] became a
reality [6–15] and new data associated to the Run 2 of the LHC are expected to be released soon.

A complementary kinematical range can be studied in ﬁxed - target collisions at the LHC. Such alternative, proposed
originally in Ref. [16], is expected to probe for example the nucleon and nuclear matter in the domain of high Feynman
xF , the transverse spin asymmetries in the Drell - Yan and Quarkonium production as well as the Quark Gluon
Plasma formation in the energy and density range between the SPS and RHIC experiments [17]. The basic idea of
the AFTER@LHC experiment is to develop a ﬁxed - target programme using the proton and heavy ions beams of the
LHC, extracted by a bent crystal, to collide with a ﬁxed proton or nuclear target, reaching high luminosities when
a target with a high density is considered. The typical energies that are expected to be reached in this experiment
are √s
70 GeV for P bA collisions. Very recently, the study of ﬁxed - target
collisions at the LHC became a reality by the injection of noble gases (He, N e, Ar) in the LHC beam pipe by the
LHCb Collaboration [18] using the System for Measuring Overlap with Gas (SMOG) device [19]. The typical ﬁxed
- target pA and P bA conﬁgurations that already have been performed were pAr collisions at √s = 69 GeV, pN e at
√s = 87 GeV, pHe/ pN e/ pAr at √s = 110 GeV, P bN e at √s = 54 GeV and P bAr at √s = 69 GeV. The associated
experimental results are expected to improve our understanding of the nuclear eﬀects present in pA collisions [20]
and, in the particular case of pHe collisions, to shed light on the antiproton production (See e.g. Ref. [21]).

The study of photon - induced interactions also is expected to be possible in ﬁxed - target collisions [16]. As
demonstrated in Refs.
[22, 23], the analysis of the exclusive dilepton and ηc photoproduction in ultraperipheral
collisions at AFTER@LHC can be useful to probe the inner hadronic structure and the existence of the Odderon,
which is one the main open questions of the strong interactions theory [24]. Assuming √s = 115/ 72/ 72 GeV for
pp/P bp/P bP b collisions, the typical values for the maximum photon - hadron and photon - photon center - of - mass
energies are √sγh . 44/ 12/ 9 GeV and √sγγ . 17/ 2.0/ 1.0 GeV, respectively. Therefore, the ﬁxed - target collisions
allows to probe the photon - induced interactions in a limited energy range, dominated by low - energy interactions.
Such analysis can be considered as complementary to those performed in the collider mode, where the maximum
energies can reach values of
(T eV ) and the cross sections receive contributions of low and high energies γγ and γh
interactions [1].

between the vector meson and the hadronic target.

In particular, we will estimate the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions for the exclusive ρ, ω and J/Ψ
photoproduction in pA and P bA collisions at the energies and conﬁgurations considered by the LHCb experiment.
Our goal in this exploratory study is to provide a ﬁrst estimate of the total cross sections and associated distributions
that can be measured at the LHC taking into account of some realistic experimental requirements on the ﬁnal states.
In our analysis we will use the STARlight Monte Carlo [25] to treat the vector meson photoproduction and its decay.
Recent results demonstrate that predictions of this Monte Carlo is able to successfully describe the main aspects of
the photon - induced interactions at the LHC (See e.g. Refs. [9, 10, 12–14]). We postpone for a future publication a
more detailed discussion about the description of the vector meson production in the soft and/or low energy regimes
probed in ﬁxed target collisions (See e.g. Ref.
[26]). Before to present our results in Section III, we will present in
the next Section a brief review of photon - induced interactions and its description in the STARlight MC. Finally, in
Section IV we will summarize our main conclusions and results.

II. FORMALISM

The basic idea in photon-induced processes is that an ultra relativistic charged hadron (proton or nucleus) gives
rise to strong electromagnetic ﬁelds, such that the photon stemming from the electromagnetic ﬁeld of one of the two
hadrons can either interact with one photon of the other hadron (photon - photon process) or can interact directly
with the other hadron (photon - hadron process) [1]. In these processes the total cross section can be factorized in
terms of the equivalent ﬂux of photons of the incident hadrons and the photon-photon or photon-target cross section.
In what follows we will focus in the exclusive vector meson production in photon - hadron interactions. In this process,
represented in Fig. 1, the topology of the ﬁnal state will be characterized by two empty regions in pseudo-rapidity,
called rapidity gaps, separating the intact hadrons from the vector meson. These events also will be characterized
by a low hadronic multiplicity and one vector meson with small transverse momentum. Such characteristics can
be used, in principle, to separate the photon - induced processes from the inelastic one [2]. Our focus will be in
ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), characterized by large impact parameters (b > Rh1 + Rh2 ), in which the photon –
induced interactions become dominant. In this case, the cross section for the exclusive vector meson photoproduction
in photon - induced interactions can be expressed by,

interactions. In the STARlight MC, the photon spectrum is calculated as follows [25, 27]

where the ﬁrst term is associated to a Pomeron exchange, dominant at high energies, and the second one to the
Reggeon exchange, which describes the behavior of the cross section at low energies. For the ρ and ω production,
both terms contribute, with ǫ = 0.22, and η being negative, in the range
1.9. Therefore, the cross
section for light mesons rises slowly with increasing Wγp. On the other hand, the J/Ψ production is assumed to be
described only by the Pomeron contribution, with ǫ = 0.65, and the cross section is supplemented by a factor that
accounts for its behavior for energies near the threshold of production. The free parameters on the parametrization
are ﬁtted using the HERA data [28]. On the other hand, in the nuclear case, the STARlight allows to estimate the
vector meson photoproduction in incoherent (γA
V A) photon - nucleus interactions.
In what follows we will present our results for the coherent production, where the cross section is determined using a
classical Glauber approach [27, 29]. In this case the coherent cross section is given by

package that propagates through the nucleus can be diﬀerent from the projective wave function and nondiagonal V
terms can contribute for the total V A cross section. Such corrections were estimated originally in Ref.
[31], which
demonstrated that the quantum calculation implies higher cross sections. Recent results [11] indicate that the classical
Glauber gives a better description of the experimental data for the ρ photoproduction in ultraperipheral collisions.
The discrepancy between the quantum calculation and data is explained as being associated to the presence of nuclear
shadowing eﬀects [32]. Consequently, the classical calculation can still be considered a good ﬁrst approximation to
estimate the magnitude of the vector meson photoproduction cross sections.

Finally, it is important to emphasize that the STARlight assumes a dipole form factor for a proton target. Such form
factor implies a t spectrum that decreases with increasing t, without the presence of diﬀractive dips. Such behavior
diﬀers from the results obtained in Refs. [33, 34] using phenomenological models based on saturation physics, which
predict that dips should be present in the spectrum.

III. RESULTS

In what follows we will present our estimates for the exclusive ρ, ω and J/Ψ photoproduction in ﬁxed - target pA
and P bA collisions at √s = 110 GeV and 69 GeV, respectively, assuming A = He, Ar. The masses and widths are
the standard Particle Data Group values. In the case of ρ and ω production we will present our predictions taking
into account the decay of these vector mesons into π+π− pairs. For J/Ψ production, we present our predictions

Our predictions for the total cross sections are presented in Table I. In our analysis we consider that both initial
state particles can be the source of the photons that generate the photon - hadron interactions. As expected from
previous studies of the exclusive vector meson photoproduction (See e.g. Refs.
[4, 35]), the cross sections decrease
with the increasing of the mass of the vector meson, being substantially larger for the ρ production. Moreover, the
P bA collisions are enhanced by the Z 2 factor present in the nuclear photon ﬂux. We have that our predictions for the
light meson production are approximately three orders of magnitude smaller than those expected in pP b and P bP b
collisions at the Run2 of the LHC in the collider mode [35]. In the J/Ψ case, the predictions are smaller by four
orders of magnitude, which is directly associated to the fact that σ(γh
h) has a steeper energy dependence

than the cross section for the light meson production (ǫJ/Ψ = 0.65
ǫρ,ω = 0.22) and that in the collider mode a
larger range of values of Wγh contributes for the hadronic cross section. In comparison to the predictions for RHIC
energies [4], we have that our results are smaller by approximately two orders of magnitude. However, as already

an exclusive photon - hadron interaction. As a consequence, the experimental analysis of this process in ﬁxed - target
collisions at the LHC is, in principle, feasible. Another important aspect is that if we assume the LHCb requirements
for the selection of a exclusive process, the impact on the total cross sections for P bA collisions is small (See Table
I), which implies that the LHCb detector ideal for the study of this process. In contrast, for pA collisions, the LHCb
requirements has a large impact on the predictions. In order to understand this result, in Fig. 2 (left panel) we present
the rapidity distribution for the exclusive ρ photoproduction in pAr collisions at √s = 110 GeV. The contributions
associated to γp and γAr interactions are presented separately, as well the sum of both. We have that at small
rapidities (yπ+π−
3.0) the distribution is dominated by γAr interactions, with the photon coming from the proton.
This contribution decreases at large rapidities. On the other hand, for yπ+π− > 3.0, the γp interactions, present when
the photon is emitted by the nucleus, become dominant and the maximum occurs at very forward rapidities, beyond
those probed by the LHCb detector. As a consequence, the LHCb requirements has a large impact on the prediction
of the total cross section in pAr collisions. Moreover, as the γp contribution increases with Z 2, the impact of these
requirements is larger in pAr than in pHe collisions, as veriﬁed in Table I. For completeness, in Fig. 2 (right panel)
we also present our predictions for the transverse momentum distribution. We can see that this distribution is also

dominated by γp interactions. Such behaviour is expected, since the t - behaviour of the γAr interactions is deﬁned
by the nuclear form factor, while in the case of γp the behavior is determined by the nucleon form factor. Due to
the diﬀerence of values between these quantities, it is expected a narrower transverse momentum distribution in γAr
than in γp interactions. We have veriﬁed that similar conclusions are derived analysing the exclusive ω and J/Ψ
photoproduction in pA collisions. In what follows we will only present the sum of γp and γA contributions.

In Fig. 3 we present our predictions for the transverse momentum distributions associated to the exclusive ρ, ω
and J/Ψ photoproduction in pAr and P bAr collisions at √s = 110 and 69 GeV, respectively. For comparison, we
also present the predictions obtained assuming the LHCb requirements. The meson pT spectrum is determined by
the sum of the photon momentum with the exchanged momentum in the interaction between the vector meson and
the target. The photon momentum is deﬁned by the equivalent photon approximation, while the exchanged one is
determined in the case of coherent interactions by the form factor of the target. As pointed out in Ref.
[36], in
the case of symmetric collisions (h1 = h2), the overall pT spectrum also is aﬀected by interference from the two
production sources. Such eﬀect will be not present in our case, since we are only considering asymmetric collisions
(h1
= h2). As both the photon and scattering transverse momenta are small, we expect that meson pT spectrum
will be dominated by small values of transverse momentum, being strongly suppressed at large p2
T . This behaviour
is observed in Fig. 3. Considering the predictions for pAr collisions, as demonstrated before, the pT distribution is
determined by γp interactions, with the photon coming from the nucleus. As a consequence, the associated predictions
for the production of the diﬀerent vector mesons are distinct from those obtained in the case of P bAr collisions, which
are determined by γA interactions. In the pAr case, we predict wider distributions. In the case of P bAr collisions,
the pT - behavior of the distributions is determined by the nuclear form factor F (t) [See Eq. (5)], which implies a
faster decreasing at large transverse momenta in comparison to the proton case. We have that the main impact of
the LHCb requirements is the modiﬁcation of the normalization of the distributions.

In Fig. 4 we present our predictions for the rapidity distributions. As we are considering the collision of non
- identical hadrons, the magnitude of the photon ﬂuxes associated to the two incident hadrons is diﬀerent, which
implies asymmetric rapidity distributions. Moreover, distinctly from the predictions for the collider mode, where the
maximum of the distributions occur at central rapidities (y
0), we have that in ﬁxed - target collisions, the maximum
≈
is shifted for forward rapidities. In particular, it occurs in the kinematical range probed by the LHCb detector in the
case of P bAr collisions. As discussed before, this result explains the small impact of the LHCb requirements on the
predictions for the total cross sections for P bAr collisions presented in Table I. In the case of light meson production,
the rapidity distribution is determined by the Reggeon and Pomeron contributions [See Eq. (4)], with the cross section
being determined by the Reggeon one at low energies near the threshold of production. Such energies are probed
7) rapidities. Our results indicate that the Reggeon contribution will be strongly
at small (y
reduced in the kinematical range probed by the LHCb detector. The absence of a reggeonic term and the higher
threshold in the J/Ψ case imply a narrower rapidity distribution. On the other hand, in the case of pAr collisions,
the maximum of the distributions occurs at very forward rapidities, beyond those probed by the LHCb. Although
the LHCb requirements have a large impact on the predictions, in particular at larger nuclei, the values presented
in Table I indicate that the analysis of the exclusive vector meson photoproduction in pA collisions is still feasible.
Finally, our results indicate a faster increasing of the rapidity distribution for the J/Ψ production with increasing of
4 in comparison to predicted for the other mesons. Such behaviour is directly associated to the

IV. SUMMARY

During the last years, the experimental results from Tevatron, RHIC and LHC have demonstrated that the study
of hadronic physics using photon - induced interactions in pp/pA/AA colliders is feasible and provide important
information about the QCD dynamics and vector meson production. In this paper, we have complemented previous
analysis of the exclusive vector meson photoproduction by considering, for the ﬁrst time, the possibility of study
this process in ﬁxed - target collisions at the LHC. Our analysis has been motivated by the proposition of the
AFTER@LHC experiment and by the study of beam - gas interactions, recently performed by the LHCb detector.
We have estimated the total cross sections, rapidity and transverse momentum distributions for the exclusive ρ, ω and
J/Ψ photoproduction in pA and P bA collisions at √s = 110 and 69 GeV using the STARlight Monte Carlo, which
allowed to take into account some typical LHCb requirements for the selection of exclusive events. Our results indicate
that the experimental analysis of this process is, in principle, feasible. If performed, such analysis will probe the vector
meson production at low energies, which will allows to improve the description of this process in a kinematical regime
unexplorated by previous ﬁxed - target experiments and current colliders.
