ABSTRACT
The primordial helium abundance YP is calculated using sulphur as metallicity tracer
in the classical methodology (with YP as an extrapolation of Y to zero metals). The
calculated value, YP, S = 0.244 ± 0.006, is in good agreement with the estimate from
the Planck experiment, as well as, determinations in the literature using oxygen as the
metallicity tracer. The chemical analysis includes the sustraction of the nebular con-
tinuum and of the stellar continuum computed from simple stellar population synthe-
sis grids. The S+2 content is measured from the near infrared [SI I I] λλ9069˚A, 9532˚A
lines, while an ICF (cid:0)S3+(cid:1) is proposed based on the Ar 3+/Ar 2+ fraction. Finally, we
apply a multivariable linear regression using simultaneously oxygen, nitrogen and sul-
phur abundances for the same sample to determine the primordial helium abundance
resulting in YP−O, N, S = 0.245 ± 0.007.

1 INTRODUCTION

The primordial light element abundances D, 4He = YP, 3He,
7 Li constitute a keystone in Big Bang cosmology along with
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the Universe
expansion. A good agreement between observed abundances,
and model parameters (such as η, the baryon to photon ra-
tio, the number of neutrino families or the neutron half-life)
enables a detailed deﬁnition of the Big Bang boundary con-
ditions.

Almost twenty ﬁve years ago, precise measurements for
the D/H = 3.40 ± 0.25 × 10−5 by Burles & Tytler (1998)
yielded a deuterium abundance almost a tenth of those pre-
viously reported (Songaila et al. 1994; Carswell et al. 1994).
These observations caused a great commotion, since either
higher YP values, or new primordial nucleosynthesis models
or non-standard physics would be required for consistency.
The exploration of these possibilities also led to a thorough
quantiﬁcation of the systematic errors in the YP determi-
nation. Overall, all these dedicated studies reached similar
conclusions (Olive & Skillman 2004; Fukugita & Kawasaki

2006; Izotov et al. 2006; Rosales-Ortega 2006; Peimbert et al.
2007a), providing values consistent with those of other cos-
mological parameters, even under the tighter WMAP and
more recently Planck experiment limits (see Planck Collab-
oration et al. 2016).

The classical method to determine the primordial He
abundance YP, proposed by Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert
(1974) and Lequeux et al. (1979), involves the extrapolation
of the present helium abundance Y down to zero metallicity.
In practice, a single element, usually O, is used as metallic-
ity tracer in ionized gas. The method is more reliable the
lower the overall metal content of the gas to analyze. This
situates low metallicity HII regions and local HII galaxies as
the best objects for the job.

HII galaxies are compact, can be easily detected and
among them the lowest metallicy galaxies are found. Their
spectra are completely dominated by the current star for-
mation episode and due to their intense gaseous emission
spectra and weak underlying stellar continua, they can pro-
vide precise measurements of the He emission lines. In fact,
in spectra with EW (Hα) > 200˚A, the underlying stellar con-
tinuum can hardly be noticed in the optical range, which
minimizes this diﬃcult to quantify source of systematic er-
ror in the derived He abundance.

In these chemically unevolved objects, it is acceptable
to assume a linear relation between the helium content and
the oxygen abundance ∆Y/∆Z ≈ ∆Y/∆O. Measuring the he-
lium mass fraction and the O abundance of the gas for a
given galaxy sample, the coeﬃcients of the resulting linear
regression are determined, i.e. YP is the ordinate extrapola-
tion to zero metals of the regression. Recently this method
to determine YP has been used in Aver et al. (2015) and
Peimbert et al. (2016) yielding results YP = 0.2449 ± 0.004
and YP = 0.2446 ± 0.0029 respectively, consistent with Stan-
dard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis model predictions and with
the value estimated by Planck Collaboration et al. (2016)
YP = 0.24467 ± 0.0002. On the other hand, the result by Izo-
tov et al. (2014), YP = 0.2551 ± 0.0022, is slightly outside the
Planck collaboration value1. The three YP determinations by
Izotov et al. (2014); Aver et al. (2015); Peimbert et al. (2016)
use the latest values of recombination coeﬃcients for the HeI
lines by Porter et al. (2012) and the associated corrigendum
Porter et al. (2013).

As already mentioned, most of the research in this topic
has used oxygen as the metallicity tracer in the Y vs. metal
regression. Indeed, within the optical range, this element
represents the obvious choice. However, it also presents clear
diﬃculties. Firstly, while oxygen has the most intense lines in
the optical range, the derivation of the electron temperature
necessary for abundance determinations requires the detec-
tion and measurement of the weak auroral [OI I I] λ4363˚A
line. This implies the selection of high excitation, high elec-
tron temperature objects for which a larger collisional exci-
tation contribution to the hydrogen recombination lines is
expected and this eﬀect is challenging to quantify. On the
other hand, due to the required high excitation, there is a
maximum oxygen abundance of the objects to be used. This,
in turn, decreases the baseline for the linear regression, in-
creasing the (∆Y/∆Z) gradient uncertainty.

(cid:16)

Nitrogen was proposed as an alternative tracer by Pagel
et al. (1992) who concluded that despite the nitrogen sec-
ondary production mechanism, a good concordance should
be found between both metallicity tracers as long as the ob-
N/H < 6.6 · 10−6(cid:17)
served objects have a low nitrogen content
and show no Wolf-Rayet features since the winds from these
stars could cause local nitrogen pollution. This conclusion
was conﬁrmed by Rosales-Ortega (2006) using a sample of
71 low metallicity HII galaxies selected from the Sloan Dig-
ital Sky Survey (SDSS) who also found, unexpectedly, that
the YP determination using nitrogen was less uncertain for
his sample and showed a better agreement with the WMAP
experiment prediction than the corresponding value found
using oxygen.

In this work we introduce the use of a third element,
sulphur, as metallicity tracer. Although less abundant than
oxygen, sulphur is also produced in massive stars through
explosive nucleosynthesis and its yield should closely follow
that of O. Nebular S/H abundances are therefore expected
to follow those of O/H and the S/O ratio is expected to
remain constant at about the solar value, logS/O (cid:39) −1.6.

1 The Planck experiment provides four ΛCDM YP estimations
depending on the various data combinations. The value tabulated
here represents an upper limit as considered by Peimbert et al.
(2016)

Empirical tests exploring this have been performed conﬁrm-
ing this ratio (Berg et al. 2015).

[SI I I]λλ9069˚A, 9539˚A

Sulphur abundances can be measured from near infrared
observations where the [SI I I] λ9069˚A and [SI I I] λ9532˚A
lines appear among the most intense features in the
range. The region in the ionized nebulae where S2+
originates practically covers the O+ and O2+ one. The
corresponding electron temperature can be well repre-
sented by Te [SI I I] derived from the line intensity ratio
/I ([SI I I]λ6312) (e.g. H¨agele et al.
I
2008, and references therein). The use of the S lines re-
sults in additional beneﬁts compared to the other elements.
Firstly, [SI I I] λ6312˚A falls in a spectral region of high instru-
mental sensitivity. Secondly, these lines are weakly aﬀected
by underlying stellar population absorption. Furthermore,
[SI I] lines can be measured with respect to Hα, while the
near-infrared [SI I I] lines can be measured with respect to
nearby Paschen lines. This is useful to minimize reddening
uncertainties and other calibration eﬀects. Finally, and most
important, the S/H abundance can be measured by direct
methods up to solar values. This is crucial in order to in-
crease the dynamical range for the ∆Y/∆S gradient calcula-
tion, with respect to the O/H and N/H metallicity range.
This would make the results less dependent on low Y - metal
poor galaxies, while increasing the sample to objects with
higher S/H.

The paper has the following structure: Section 2
presents the observations of the selected HII galaxy sam-
ple and the data reduction. Section 3 describes the analysis
of the data and the results attained. These results are dis-
cussed in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions of this work are
summarized in Section 5.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The HII galaxy sample was selected from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) to perform further ad-hoc observations.
The current Data release, DR12, represents the ﬁnal output
from the SDSS-III survey (Ahn et al. (2014)). In addition to
ﬁve photometric bands, spectroscopic data are included for
over 6.7 × 105 stars, galaxies and quasars. The light, cover-
ing from 3800 ˚A to 9200 ˚A with a resolution power around
R = 1800 is received through a 3-arcsec diameter ﬁber aper-
ture. For low redshifts, this conﬁguration enables an eﬃcient
selection of objects with strong emission lines, including the
[SI I I] λ9069˚A line.

The primordial helium abundance determination re-
quires the analysis of young, low metallicity and relatively
high excitation nebulae, which contain a negligible or small
amount of neutral helium. Additionally, a high signal-to-
noise ratio is essential. High values of the hydrogen emission
line equivalent widths guarantee this requirement while also
selecting young objects with little underlying stellar popula-
tion absorption. The galaxy sample selection has then been
performed following the criteria:

• Ew (Hα) > 200 ˚A
• 0.7 < σHα < 3.5 ˚A
• (S/N)Hα > 100
• [N I I] λ6583/Hα < 0.2
• [OI I I] λ4363/H β ≥ 0.1

• 0.0007 < z < 0.2

Finally, BPT diagrams (Baldwin et al. (1981)) were used in
order to exclude AGN and LINERs. Special care was taken
not to include objects with wide Wolf-Rayet features: the
blue bump, around the HeI Iλ4686˚A line and the red bump,
around the CIVλ 5808˚A line to avoid possible metal contam-
ination.

2.1 Sample description

The spectra were acquired with the double arm Interme-
diate Dispersion Spectrograph and Imaging System (ISIS)
attached to the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) at
the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory during several ob-
serving runs between 2008 and 2015. The observations were
taken using two diﬀerent conﬁgurations.

In Conﬁguration I, the R300B blue grating was centred
at λc, Blue = 5950˚A covering between 4300˚A and 7600˚A and
the red R316R one was centred at λc, Red = 8655˚A to cover
between 7260˚A and 10050˚A. The 7500 dichroic was used in
this set up.

Conﬁguration II used the R300B grating covering be-
tween 3200 ˚A and 5550 ˚A and centred at λc, Blue = 4375 ˚A.
The R310R grating in the red arm was centred at λc, Red =
7615 ˚A to cover between 5500˚A and 9730˚A. The 5700 dichroic
was used for this conﬁguration.

For both setups, the EEV12 and REDPLUS detectors
were used at the blue and red arm respectively. Both conﬁg-
urations provided a similar spectral dispersion of 0.86 ˚A/pix
with a pixel size close to 0.2 arcsec. The slit width was ad-
justed to the seeing with values between 1 and 1.5 arcsec.
The observations were performed at small zenith distance
and at parallactic angle to avoid eﬀects of diﬀerential
refraction in the UV-blue. In most cases these observa-
tions provided an adequate signal-to-noise for the analysis
of weak lines such as [SI I] λλ6717˚A, 6731˚A, [OI I I] λ4363˚A,
[Ar IV] λ4740˚A and [SI I I] λ6312˚A. Table 1 presents the ob-
served sample. The ﬁrst and second columns give the object
name and the SDSS denomination respectively. The redshift
is shown in column 3. The object coordinates are given in
columns 4 and 5 and the instrumental conﬁguration used is
shown in column 6.

Several bias and sky ﬂat-ﬁeld frames were obtained at
both dusk and dawn. Additionally, a pair of ﬂatﬁelds and
one calibration lamp exposure (CuNe + CuAr) were taken at
each science position. The ﬁles were processed with IRAF2
following standard procedures: bias subtraction, division by
a normalized ﬂatﬁeld and wavelength calibration. The latter
was accomplished using 20 to 40 lines. The spectra were
ﬂux calibrated and the edges between blue and red arms
matched.To this purpose, at least two spectrophotometric
standard stars were observed each night. This allowed a good
ﬂux calibration with an estimated precision of around 5%.

contamination. As an extra data reduction step, the ob-
ject spectra were divided by a normalized featureless spec-
trum from a standard star observed with the same slit
width as the object (D´ıaz et al. 1985). Fig. 1 illustrates
this procedure for SDSS J024815.93-081716.5. The normal-
ized spectrum belongs to the standard star Feige 34, whose
absorption features have been clipped prior to the nor-
malization operation. Unfortunately, the telluric observa-
tions could not be accomplished every night. For the ob-
jects whose I([SI I I] λ9532˚A)/I([SI I I] λ9069˚A) ratio deviated
considerably from the theoretical value (2.47 Hudson et al.
2012), only one of the lines was considered in our analy-
sis choosing the one least aﬀected by the atmospheric fea-
tures. Two examples of the ﬁnal reduced spectra are shown
in Fig.2. The remaining sample spectra can be seen in the
manuscript supporting material.

3 ANALYSIS

3.1 Spectral components

The emission lines represent the most distinctive features in
HII galaxy spectra. The hydrogen and helium recombina-
tion lines are aﬀected by the absorption lines from the ioniz-
ing stars spectrum, present at the same wavelengths. These
absorptions can be very important for the fainter helium
lines and must be taken into account in this element abun-
dance calculation. Moreover, in the youngest HII regions,
the hydrogen and helium nebular continua might contribute
as much as the stellar continuum. The following subsections
describe how these three components: nebular, stellar and
emission line spectra are measured prior to undertaking any
chemical analysis.

3.2 Hydrogen and helium nebular continua

Three distinct components contribute to the nebular contin-
uum; they can be calculated from quantum physics princi-
ples. The free-free continuum is governed by Bremsstrahlung
processes. As electrons travel within the ionized hydrogen
or helium Coulomb’s radius, they suﬀer a deﬂection and
emit photons. These photons are of relatively low energy
and hence this component contributes mainly in the infrared
spectral region. This eﬀect is calculated by Brown & Math-
ews (1970) and Osterbrock (1974):

cient. In the case of the free-free component, the latter coeﬃ-
cient can be calculated from the following relation, in which

free to bound states (recombination). This process is responsible
for the Paschen and Balmer jumps. Computing γν, f b , requires
to add up all the recombination to states of principal quantum
number (n) (e.g. Ercolano & Storey 2006). In their hydrogenic
codes, convergence is obtained by considering principal quantum
levels up to n = 200 for hydrogen and n = 350 for helium. Their
results are presented in tabular form, where γν, f b is parametrised
as a function of temperature and wavelength.

Finally, in the ultraviolet region, the main nebular contribu-
tion comes from the hydrogen 2s → 1s decay, which produces a
photon pair. Thereby, this emission is commonly referred to as 2-

respectively. These parameters are determined from the ﬁts of

Once (γν ) has been tabulated for each process and ion, the to-
tal nebular emissivity can be calculated from the HeI and HeI I

fractions. The ﬁnal hydrogen and helium components are com-
puted as:

Up to this point, the nebular continuum calculation requires
some estimates of the electron temperature and of He0 and He+
abundances. A characteristic low ionization temperature from the
[SI I I ] lines was used. This is a reasonable assumption as the twice
ionized sulphur population covers a large percentage of the HII
region volume.

Translating emissivity to ﬂux for a given object would require
accurate knowledge of both distance and density. Fortunately, a
more feasible approach is proposed by Zanstra (1931) to estimate
the ultraviolet continuum produced by the ionizing stars from
the recombination lines intensity. In our case, we compare the
emissivity from a recombination line and the nebular continuum.

3.3 Underlying stellar continuum

The observed hydrogen and helium lines are the combination of
the emission lines from the ionized gas and the absorption lines
from the ionizing stars atmosphere. In order to obtain a pure
emission line spectrum the subtraction of the stellar contribution
is mandatory. This can be accomplished with the help of stellar
population synthesis models. Here we used the STARLIGHT syn-
thesis code (Cid Fernandes et al. 2005). In this code, we used a
Single Stellar Population (SSP) library with ages, between 1 M yr

and 17 Gyr, and metallicities, between Z(cid:12)/200 and 1.5 · Z(cid:12). Suit-
able emission line masks were manually selected for each observed
spectrum as described in the following section. Additionally, the
ﬁrst and ﬁnal 50 ˚A of the observed spectra were also masked. The
spectra were re-sampled to 1 ˚A/pixel as required by the code.

In our analysis, the observations were reduced without taking
into account the error propagation. Consequently, the error per
pixel is not quantiﬁed. As an alternative, STARLIGHT computes
a global value from the ﬂux rms used during the normalization. In
our case, this ﬂux window is between 4750˚A and 4840˚A. Initially
the minimum visual extinction was set to zero and the default
maximum velocity dispersion was set to each galaxy σC a I I or
σ[O I I I ] value, the velocity dispersion measured from the width of
the near-IR CaII triplet absorptions or from the [OI I I] emission
lines.

Once the nebular and stellar continua are removed from the ob-
served spectrum, the pure emission line ﬂuxes can be measured.
A graphical interface was designed to inspect the spectral fea-
tures in the relevant wavelength range. The detected emission
line along with two adjacent continuum regions of at least 20 ˚A
were manually selected and a linear continuum ﬁt was performed.
The integrated line ﬂux was then measured. The uncertainty from
each line ﬂux and equivalent width was estimated using a boot-
strap algorithm: a set of random realizations of every line pixel
was generated using data poissonian 1σ uncertainty from the con-
tinua adjacent to the line. At each iteration, the area under the
line is measured and a Gaussian ﬁt performed. This generates a
distribution for the line ﬂux and Gaussian parameters (peak in-
tensity, central wavelength and standard deviation) from which
their 1σ uncertainty is determined.

A similar procedure was applied to blended lines, where their
ﬂux is determined assuming a combination of Gaussian curves.

are labelled. The object images belong to the SDSS database.

Extra care was given to the [N I I] λλ6548˚A, 6583˚A and Hα re-
gion. Even though our resolution is high enough to separate all
three lines, for some objects Hα has a broad component that
contaminates the [N I I] emission. The intensity and shape of this
component are commonly explained by gas inﬂows/outﬂows and
hence it changes from object to object. The following strategy
provided the best output:

(i) Three Gaussians were ﬁtted for

[N I I] 6548˚A, Hα,
[N I I] 6583˚A narrow components with the following constraints:
the central wavelength of the narrow features must be within ±2 ˚A
of the expected value; both hydrogen and nitrogen emissions are
assumed to share the same σ; and the [N I I] 6583˚A/[N I I ] 6548˚A
ﬂux ratio must be 2.94 [assuming the N + atomic data from Tayal
(2011), Wiese et al. (1996) and Galav´ıs et al. (1997)].

(ii) The ﬁtted narrow emission is removed from the spectrum

leaving only the Hα broad component, which is ﬁtted with a
Gaussian curve.

(iii) In the last step, both the narrow and wide Hα compo-
nents are ﬁtted using constraints from the previous ﬁts: the wide
component central wavelength is ﬁxed from the value obtained on
the second ﬁt. Additionally, its peak ﬂux is also contained within
±10% the value obtained in the previous ﬁtting. The narrow com-
ponents have the same constraints as those described for the ﬁrst
ﬁtting.

raw and reddening corrected H β ﬂuxes for both galaxies are given
in erg cm−2 s−1 ˚A
. These values have been corrected for the un-

reddening. The c (H β) coeﬃcient, determined canonically from
the Balmer decrement is also given in the table. We considered
appropriate for these young starforming bursts the “LMC aver-
age” reddening curve from Gordon et al. (2003) with RV = 3.4.
The recombination coeﬃcients are calculated using PyNeb (see

Luridiana et al. 2015, among others) with the atomic data of
Storey & Hummer (1995). The Paschen series was not included
in the c (H β) calculation as the simple stellar populations used
reach only up to 7000˚A as already mentioned.

The abundances of He, S, O and N are calculated from the
reddening corrected emission line ﬂuxes also using PyNeb. The
tools provided by this library were scripted into a Monte Carlo
algorithm to propagate the uncertainty in the emission line ﬂuxes
to the electron temperatures and densities, and ﬁnally, to the
chemical abundances. The abundances were determined following
these steps:

(i) PyNeb calculates simultaneously ne and Te using suitable
density and temperature diagnostic lines. Lines which arise from
similar excitation energies for the former and the ratio of lines
with diﬀerent excitation energies to estimate the latter as usual.
The S+ density determined from the [SI I] λλ6716˚A, 6731˚A lines
diagnostic is adopted for all species. This diagnostic, however,
starts to loose sensitivity at densities below 100 cm−3. For ob-
jects where the density calculated from these diagnostic was be-
low 75 cm−3 the value was set to 50 ± 25 cm−3.

(ii) We considered a three zone model for the electron tem-
perature: a high ionization zone where ions like O2+, N e2+ are
produced; a lower ionization zone where ions like O+, N e+, N +,
S+ are formed and a third intermediate ionization zone which par-
tially overlaps the previous two ones, where ions like S2+ and Ar 2+
are formed. The diﬀerent temperatures that characterize each ion
population are further discussed in the following subsections.

(iii) For the majority of the objects, similar temperature preci-
sion was attained for Te [SI I I ] and Te [OI I I ]. This can be noticed
in Fig. 3, where both temperatures are plotted for the observed
galaxies. For some objects though, the uncertainty is larger for
one of the temperatures. If this is the Te [OI I I ], it usually cor-
responds to data obtained with instrument conﬁguration I, in
which the [OI I I ] λ4363˚A line is very close to the blue edge of
the spectrum, hence it is noisier. The cases with larger error
in Te [SI I I ] are those that show important telluric contamina-
tion around the S2+ lines, where the continuum was extracted.
Still, as seen in the ﬁgure, the correspondence is quite good as
expected (Garnett 1992). Consequently, it is possible to replace
the higher-uncertainty temperature using the linear ﬁtting, while
propagating the lower uncertainty. We used eq. 16, taken from
P´erez-Montero & D´ıaz (2005), who use the same atomic parame-
ters as we are using in this work for the sulphur and oxygen ions:

te [OI I I ] = 1.0807 × te [SI I I ] − 0.0846
Additional literature ﬁts are also plotted in Fig. 3, as it can be
appreciated, they are all very similar in the 10000 - 16000 K range.
(iv) The ionic abundances are calculated from the most intense
line (if more than one is available their intensities are added up).

(16)

(v) For the error propagation we used a bootstrap algorithm:
for each line a one thousand length array is generated. The ﬂuxes
in this array come from a normal distribution deﬁned by the mean
line intensity and its uncertainty.

(vi) Since the bootstrap algorithm assumes a normal distribu-
tion for the generated ﬂux arrays, some diagnostic ratios may lie
beyond the physical boundaries. In these cases, PyNeb generates
a non numerical entry. These values are systematically removed
at each step and are replaced with random values generated from
a normal distribution of the valid entries.

The references for the atomic data used in these calculations

are listed in Table 3.

3.5.1 Helium:

The helium spectrum shows several lines within the observed
range. Clearly, the greater the number of lines considered, the

most robust the analysis. However, not all the lines share the same
dependence on Te and ne and some are faint. Moreover, not all
lines are evenly aﬀected by external physical phenomena e.g. bluer
lines are more susceptible to underlying stellar absorption and
reddening. (e.g. Aver et al. 2015, and references therein) solved
simultaneously for the six physical parameters contributing to the
helium line intensity. In the present study these are quantiﬁed
separately. The stellar absorption is corrected from the SSPs ﬁt
once the nebular continuum has been removed from the observed
spectrum. The reddening coeﬃcient (c (H β)) is calculated from
the Balmer decrement. The collisional eﬀect on the helium lines
is already included in the emissivities (Porter et al. 2013). Finally,
we assumed T (HeI) = Te [OI I I ] = Thi gh and ne (HeI ) = ne [SI I ].
At this point the abundance is calculated using χ2 ﬁtting over the
set of HeI lines:

This ﬁt is repeated in a one thousand bootstrap algorithm,
in which Te and ne values are randomly generated from the mea-
sured values assuming a Gaussian distribution. The algorithm
output is itself a distribution which provides He+ mean value and
uncertainty. The code uses the HeI λ4471˚A, 5876˚A, 6678˚A lines to
perform the ﬁt.

A similar approach is used to calculate the He2+ abundance
if the HeI Iλ4686 ˚A line is observed. The previous assumptions
imply that the HeI and HeII emission are produced in the high
ionization region. This is an acceptable assumption for HeI I as
can be seen by using photoionization models. For HeI, Peimbert
and colaborators (Peimbert et al. 2002) analysed the possible bias
introduced on the primordial helium determination by assuming
Te (HeI) = Te (OI I I ). However, as discussed by Aver et al. (2010)
and Aver et al. (2015), a large degeneracy in the temperature ex-
ists when calculating helium abundance, quite possibly enhanced
by temperature ﬂuctuations (Luridiana et al. 2003). To overcome
this degeneracy, Aver and collaborators have used a temperature
prior based on the measured Te ([OI I I ]) to ﬁt the model param-
eters. Still, the mean uncertainty in the helium temperature for
their ﬂagged sample is ∆Te (He ) ≈ 2200 K. The approach proposed
here represents a simpliﬁcation that consists on using Te ([OI I I ])

model can be found in the ionization structure diagrams, such
as those introduced by Garnett (1992). Fig.4 was generated us-
ing the data from the evolutionary synthesis models developed
by Mart´ın-Manj´on et al. (2010) within the PopStar project. The
radiation spectrum along with the ionizing photons, inner ra-
dius and gas metallicity were used as the input conditions in
Cloudy 17.01 (Ferland et al. 2017). This enabled us to sim-
ulate a wide range of starforming regions. The model grid is
characterized by log (age) = 5.0 − 10.0, Zg a s = 0.0004 − 0.05,
M ass = 12000 − 200000 M(cid:12), log (Z(cid:63)) = −2.1 and ne = 100 cm−3.

Fig. 4 displays the ionization structure from two of the mod-
els: oxygen and sulphur for 105 M(cid:12) and 2 ·105 M(cid:12) cluster masses. A
sharp transition between S+ and S2+ ionization states can be seen.
Both ions are observed in the transition zone and a common elec-
tron temperature may be assumed. Henceforth, this temperature
is referred to as Tl ow and the sulphur abundance is calculated as:

Due to the low ionization potential for sulphur, the neutral
S fraction can be neglected. However, this may not be true for
the S3+ population. A direct S3+ determination would require
the ﬂux from the infrared [SIV ] 10.51µm line. As an alternative
we propose an individualized ICF (Ionization Correction Factor)
based on argon. The Ar +2/Ar +3 vs. S2+/S3+ relation is shown in

ions are situated in a lower ionization region with a lower mean
temperature. For this zone it is possible to adopt Te [OI I] ≈
Te [SI I I ] H¨agele et al. (2006, 2008). To calculate the ionic abun-
dances, the O2+ fraction can be accurately measured from the
[OI I I ] λλ4959˚A, 5007˚A lines. Ideally the O+ abundance should
be measured from the strong [OI I ] λλ3726˚A, 3729˚A doublet. Un-
fortunately, these lines are not available for objects observed
with our conﬁguration I (see Table 1). For these objects we
use the [OI I ] λλ7319˚A, 7330˚A weaker auroral lines doublet. Al-
though these lines have been used in the literature to calculate
the O+abundance (see Kniazev et al. 2003; Pilyugin et al. 2006;
S´anchez Almeida et al. 2016), they have also been reported to in-
crease the dispersion on physical parameters such as the Te [OI I]
as described by Kennicutt et al. (2003). These authors argue that
one phenomenon contributing to these deviations is the recombi-

3.5.4 Nitrogen:

In the optical wavelength range, the nitrogen abundance is nor-
maly derived from the [N I I] λλ6548˚A, 6583˚A lines. Our spectral
resolution is enough to discriminate both lines from Hα. Never-
theless, as explained in Sec. 3.4, some objects required a ﬁtting
of four Gaussians to remove the contribution from a broad Hα
component.

A strong linear relation appears to exist between the Te [N I I]
and Te [SI I I ] values (Croxall et al. 2015) which validates the prac-
tice of adopting Te ([N I I]) ≈ Te ([SI I I ]) (P´erez-Montero & D´ıaz
2003). For a given atomic data set, the N + abundance is deﬁned

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 2 includes emission lines data for two galaxies observed
using ISIS-I and ISIS-II set ups respectively3. The table lists the
equivalent width, the observed ﬂux and the reddening-corrected
intensity (where Hβ = 1000). These entries include the correction
from the underlying stellar continuum ﬁtting.

For 4He to be considered a “baryometer”4 its primordial
abundance (YP ) needs to be determined with high accuracy tak-
ing into account the many possible error sources (e.g. Davidson &
Kinman 1985) in particular the systematic errors (e.g. Peimbert
et al. 2007b). The uncertainties can be separated into 5 groups:
data acquisition and reduction, quantifying the spectra compo-
nents, ionic abundances calculation procedures, ionization cor-
rection factors and total abundances determination, and ﬁnally,
errors associated with the extrapolation to zero metals.

In what follows we will use our data to derive YP as the ex-
trapolation to zero metals of the relation between He and metal
abundances, using as metallicity indicator sulphur and compare
the results to those obtained using the classical approach of oxy-
gen and nitrogen as metallicity indicators. We will also discuss
the impact on the YP value of the diﬀerent sources of error.

[SI I I ] λλ9069, 9532˚A lines are prominent features in this wave-
length range. We have discussed in section 2 the diﬃculties that
arise from observing in this region and how to circumvent them.
Since our current reduction pipeline does propagate the
pixel ﬂux uncertainty, theoretical
ionic emissivity ratios may
be compared with the observed ionic ﬂux ratios as a qual-
itative check. The ﬁrst and second column in Table 4

from the theoretical value by below 5%, below 10% and above
10% respectively. A very good agreement for the oxygen ratio in
the blue spectrograph arm can be noticed. Regarding the sulphur
ratio in the red arm, a close to theoretical ratio is obtained when
telluric corrections could be performed.

These results suggest a ﬂux calibration within 5% which is
the error assumed for the standard stars ﬂux calibration curves.

4.2 Flux uncertainty

Flux uncertainties can have an impact on the physical parameters,
e.g. a 10% uncertainty yields a temperature diﬀerence in T [SI I I ]
of around 500 K. This translates into an abundance uncertainty
of around 0.15 dex (see Kennicutt et al. 2003; H¨agele et al. 2008;
Dors et al. 2016). Fortunately, the random nature of this error
minimizes its eﬀect on the linear regression YP vs. S/H as long as
its magnitude remains small.

4.3 Nebular continuum uncertainty

Our sample selection criterion of EW (Hα) > 200 ˚A guarantees an
ionizing cluster younger than 10 M yr (see Dottori & Bica 1981;

Leitherer et al. 1999). The youngest burst in our sample would be
that of SHOC220 with EW (Hα) = 1310˚A. In such young bursts,
the luminosity is dominated by the emission. However, to guaran-
tee the most accurate abundance derivation from the weak helium
lines, the underlying stellar absorption needs to be quantiﬁed for
which previous subtraction of the nebular continuum is required.
The nebular continuum can be calculated from ﬁrst princi-
ples, as described in section 3.2. This calculation, however, re-
quires the input of some characteristic electron temperature and
density, as well as ﬂux. These parameters can be inferred from the
data when it includes the Balmer and/or Paschen jumps. In the
former case, the continuum temperature (TB a c ) can be related
to the jump ﬂux intensity (BJ) and the H11λ3770˚A Balmer line,
following Liu et al. (2001):

TB a c = 368 ·

(cid:16)

1 + 0.259 · y

+ + 3.409 · y2+(cid:17) (cid:18) BJ
H11

(cid:19)

(29)

where the Balmer jump ﬂux is calculated assuming linear con-
tinuum regions before and after the discontinuity. In this work
(see 3.2) the nebular continuum intensity was calibrated using
a Zanstra-like approach, eq. 15, using a hydrogen recombination
line. We used Hα due to its relatively low contamination by stel-
lar absorption. The de-reddened spectrum of SHOC579 is shown
in ﬁgure 6, where we can distinguish the small Balmer jump and
the H20λ3683˚A line. Using eq. 29, TB a c = 13200 ± 3000 K in agree-
ment with the values estimated from the oxygen and sulfur emis-
sion line diagnostics, although this measurement has a larger un-
certainty. This was also the conclusion reached by Garc´ıa-Rojas
et al. (2012) for planetary nebulae: The large number of emission
lines in the proximity of the hydrogen discontinuities leaves very
few points to perform the linear ﬁts. The situation is worse for
the Paschen jump due to the telluric contamination on the contin-
uum. An optimum solution would consist of ﬁtting simultaneously
the nebular and stellar continua to the observed spectrum. This
approach has been applied successfully by Gomes & Papaderos
(2017) in their FADO package. Fortunately, for the electron tem-
peratures and densities commonly encountered in HII galaxies,
the featureless nebular continuum is almost independent of these
parameters (Zhang et al. 2004). Consequently, for this region, the
nebular continuum shape can be obtained assuming Te = 10000 K
and ne = 100.0. This is also the approach employed by FADO for
input spectra which don’t include the hydrogen discontinuities.

4.4 Uncertainties in the underlying population

subtraction

Rosales-Ortega (2006) illustrated the impact of including a spec-
tral synthesis analysis on the helium abundance calculation. The
absorption on the recombination lines can be checked in Fig. 6,
which displays the ﬁtted stellar continuum for SHOC579 using
STARLIGHT. Our SSP library is particularly tailored for young
and low metallicity populations (as described in section 3.3). In
these galaxies, as it can be seen on the ﬁgure, the absorption fea-
tures may be absent on the observed spectrum. Consequently, it is
challenging for spectra synthesis codes to ﬁt a stellar continuum.
Within our SSPs library wavelength coverage, our spectra do not
include any signiﬁcant absorption features. To avoid overestima-
tions on the stellar velocity dispersion, our ﬁttings are constrained
to a maximum calculated from the mean velocity dispersion of the
CaII triplet lines. If these were not observed, the [OI I I ] λ5007˚A
velocity dispersion was adopted (20 < σ[O I I I ]λ5007˚A < 80 km/s).
The histograms in Fig. 7 display the stellar population out-
put from the STARLIGHT ﬁt to SHOC579. The left and right
panels correspond to the mass and light weighted population dis-
tribution respectively versus the age bin. The metallicities are
colour coded in the 0.00037 < Z < 0.03153 interval. The impli-
cations from these results are as expected: the older populations
dominate the mass, while the younger one dominates the light. A

metallicity gradient may be noted with older stars displaying a
lower metal content. Additional information which can be derived
from this analysis includes the current stellar mass. For SHOC579
log (MT ) = 8.05 which implies that the host galaxy should be rel-
atively evolved, although we cannot say anything from the ob-
served spectrum. Finally, to compare the nebular and stellar con-
tinuum luminosity, we integrate the total ﬂux from each contin-
uum for our wavelength range. This is displayed on the right hand
side histogram in Fig. 7 as a dashed horizontal line that quantiﬁes
the nebular-to-stellar luminosity percentage. For SHOC579, the
nebular luminosity is almost 20% of the stellar luminosity and is
of the same order as the brightest population. This illustrates the

impact of the gas luminosity whenever we seek to quantify the
youngest populations on bursts of star formation.

While the input spectra on these STARLIGHT ﬁttings have
been corrected from reddening, the program also computes a uni-
form extinction of the stellar populations. For most objects this
extinction is very low or zero suggesting that the extinction in
the ionized gas is similar to that of the immersed stellar pop-
ulation. However, this is not the case for SHOC579 for which
AV ; st ell ar = 0.43, while the extinction predicted from the Balmer
decrement is AV ; g a s = 0.061 ± 0.002 assuming a Gordon et al.
(2003) extinction law with RV = 3.4. The impact on the redden-
ing correction is further discussed in the next section.

The goodness of the STARLIGHT ﬁtting depends largely on

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2018)

Primordial helium abundance determination using sulphur as metallicity tracer

13

the available amount of unmasked spectrum and on the intensity
of the absorption features. Conﬁguration II covers almost 1000˚A
more than Conﬁguration I. In the latter case, the unmasked con-
tinuum is practically featureless: no sizable absorptions are de-
tected even on the helium lines. In these cases, the SSP synthesis
result consists in just a single young stellar population. Quanti-
fying the accuracy and precision of these ﬁts remains a challenge
for a SSP algorithm (Cid Fernandes et al. 2013). Still, even with
a poor stellar population ﬁt, the current analysis should not be
less accurate than results using other methods for quantifying the
underlying stellar population in previous YP determinations. We
have already mentioned the approach by Rosales-Ortega (2006)
followed by Peimbert et al. (2007b) who computed the helium
abundance taking EWa b ≈ 2˚A from Gonz´alez-Delgado et al.
(2005) models. In the multidimensional analysis by Aver et al.
(2015), they consider two constant values for the underlying ab-
sorption in each object: one for the hydrogen lines and another
one for the helium lines. Finally, Izotov et al. (2014), uses for all
the HII regions an underlying absorption for each helium line from
the models of Gonz´alez-Delgado et al. (2005) and the Starburst99
high resolution spectra (Leitherer et al. 1999).

The solution towards a better stellar continuum ﬁt relies on
increasing the wavelength coverage while preserving the temporal
and spectral resolution. Currently, the simple stellar libraries by
(Bruzual & Charlot 2003), which reach 9500 ˚A, are being updated
with younger stellar populations5. Consequently, it will be possi-
ble to ﬁt the CaII triplet (λ8498˚A, 8542˚A, 8662˚A) in observations
such as these ones. This will provide an anchor to the older stellar
population.

4.5 Te, ne and ionic abundances

At this point the emission line ﬂuxes can be used to calculate
Te and ne . The extinction still needs to be calculated, though.
A canonical approach consists in comparing the theoretical ratio
of the Balmer lines with the observed ﬂux ratios along with a
reddening law. In HII regions, however, there is some degener-
acy in this approach since the observed recombination lines could
also be aﬀected by underlying stellar absorption. The solution we
chose is to apply the following scheme:

(i) An initial reddening correction is obtained from the Balmer
decrement assuming Te = 10000 K and ne = 100 cm−3; the theo-
retical ratios are calculated using PyNeb. We use Gordon et al.
(2003) reddening law as appropriate for young starforming bursts
with RV = 3.4.

(ii) The ionic abundances are calculated.
(iii) The nebular contribution is calculated using the physical
parameters determined from the previous step and the dered-
dened Hα emission.

(iv) The nebular contribution is subtracted from the dered-

dened object spectrum and the stellar continuum is ﬁtted.

(v) The nebular and stellar continua are removed from the

spectrum and the corrected emission lines are measured.

(vi) A new reddening coeﬃcient is calculated. The previous
steps are repeated using the measurements from this iteration as
initial values.

(vii) From the second iteration we obtain the ﬁnal line intensi-
ties and from them the element abundances as discussed in section
3.5, which we will use in a regression to estimate YP as we will
discuss in the following section.

Since both the extinction and underlying stellar absorption to the

recombination lines increase towards shorter wavelengths the red-
dening coeﬃcient decreases in the second iteration. In one object,
it decreased to almost a half of its original value. However, since
most of these objects show low extinction this change did not pro-
duce a great impact on the ionic abundances. As mentioned in the
previous section, the stellar bases employed on the stellar popula-
tion synthesis did not reach beyond 7000 ˚A. Consequently, none of
the Paschen lines could be included on the reddening calculation
as they were not corrected from stellar absorption. Still, even if
this would had been the case, the Paschen lines within our wave-
length range (P20 to P9) have a low signal to noise ratio due to the
telluric contamination. Consequently, their weight on the c (Hβ)
linear ﬁt is very low compared to the one from the Balmer Hα,
H β, Hγ and H δ lines. As an additional precaution, to avoid ﬂux
calibration mismatch between the spectrograph arms, the lines in
the blue arm were normalized with respect to H β, while for those
in the red arm we used the most intense hydrogen recombination
line available depending on the conﬁguration: Hα, P8 or P9. Af-
terwards, these lines were multiplied by the theoretical emissivity
ratio (cid:0)(cid:15)λ, r e d ar m/(cid:15)H β
(cid:1) so that the lines in both arms could be
compared.

A direct abundance estimate, such as the one described in
section 3.5, requires measurement of both temperature and den-
sity sensitive line ratios. For our data we can determine Te [OI I I ]
and Te [SI I I ] for both conﬁgurations. These values are given in
Table 4. Te [OI I I ] has been exclusively used in the helium abun-
dance determination. This is due to the characteristics of the ob-
jects involved: low metallicity and high ionization factors. This
guarantees strong lines, hence good precision. In contrast the
Te [SI I I ] can be measured in ionized gas with metallicity up to
solar. This is an important asset in order to determine better
the slope of the relation and therefore to extend the linear re-
gression for determining YP (see the following subsection). On
the other hand, stronger lines imply smaller uncertainty for the
gradient (Berg et al. 2015, CHAOS survey). Berg and collabora-
tors use T [SI I I ], T [N I I] and the theoretical relation by Garnett
(1992) to estimate the high ionization Te [OI I I ].This was shown
in Fig. 3. The orthogonal linear regression from our data agrees
with the estimates in the literature. The dotted line represents
the estimate from Garnett (1992) while the dashed lines are the
photo-ionization models by P´erez-Montero & D´ıaz (2005) and
P´erez-Montero (2014). The diﬀerent gradients in these two linear
models can be explained by the diﬀerent atomic data sources for
the S2+ collisional strengths. It should be noticed that all lines
overlap in the 10, 000 − 15, 000K region. This is also the region,
where Te [SI I I ] (cid:118) Te [OI I I ] and where most of our data falls.
The well known extremely low metallicity HII galaxy IZw18 lies
in the outskirts of this relation displaying a higher than expected
Te [SI I I ]. Its chemical analysis, however, is still under debate. In a
recent paper by Kehrig et al. (2016), this galaxy was analyzed us-
ing integral ﬁeld spectroscopy to compare the emission from both
NW and SE galaxy knots. The NW region is larger, has a higher
electron temperature, lower metallicity and a stronger continuum.
In contrast, the smaller SE region has slightly higher metallicity
=
and lower electron temperature. Their estimates: Te [OI I I ] N W
= 19600±600 K agree within errors
23000±700 K and Te [OI I I ]SW
with our values shown in Table 4. Given the linear relation be-
tween both temperatures for our sample objects, as discussed in
section 3.5, we adopted the following compromise: the most pre-
cise temperature (either Te [OI I I ] or Te [SI I I ]) is used to charac-
terize the galaxy. For example, if a low redshift object has a large
error for the [OI I I] λ4363˚A line because it lies very close to the
spectrum edge, the high ionization temperature will be calculated
using Te [SI I I ] in eq. 16. This will minimize the dispersion on the
regression hence improving the extrapolation for determining YP ,
as will be discussed in the following sections.

First, the O+/H + determination for many objects depends on the
[OI I ] λλ7319˚A, 7330˚A lines as the stronger [OI I] λλ3726˚A, 3729˚A
doublet is not observed with Conﬁguration I. These weaker lines
are aﬀected by a recombination eﬀect and in some cases also by
sky emission. These eﬀects are treated using the recombination
prediction from eq. 24 and the telluric correction respectively.
The possible underlying stellar absorption can not be properly
accounted for as those lines are beyond the wavelength limit of
the used stellar database, as already discussed. It is expected,
however, that this error should be very small given the young
age, by selection, of the sample.

S3+(cid:17)
The second diﬀerence is the calculation of the ICF
using argon (see section 3.5.2 and Fig. 5). Even when S+3 is ex-
pected to be present in these objects on account of their high
excitation, still it is hard to quantify. Even though data exists for
[SIV ] 10.51µm or [SI I I ] 18.71µm these lines have also a recombi-
nation component. It is essential to anchor the infrared results to
optical observations by including measurements of a nearby re-
combination line. Fig. 8 compares the predictions using our ICFs
with available infrared data for [SIV ] 10.51µm and [SI I I ] 18.71µm
in the literature as compiled by Dors et al. (2016). While the em-
pirical results are biased towards low temperatures both ICFs
cover the same region. The uncertainty in these ICFs comes both
from the error propagation on the ionic abundances, and from
the ﬁt using eq. 21. The helium, oxygen and nitrogen ionic abun-
dances for our sample are shown in Table 5, while Table 6 displays
their measured sulphur and argon ionic abundances.

The superscript on the names indicates the Y, Z regressions, where the object is included.

relation was also found by Pagel et al. (1992) and conﬁrmed by
Rosales-Ortega (2006). This was an unexpected result given the
primary/secondary nature of N: the C–N–O cycle from low mass
stars and the α process in massive stars. In contrast, the oxygen
and sulphur nucleosynthesis can only be originated by the sec-
ond mechanism. It has been claimed that the agreement between
the Y-O and Y-N regressions is expected under the premises:
no serious pollution from Wolf-Rayet stars and low metallicities
N/H < 6.6 · 10−6(cid:17)
(cid:16)
. The He-S regression proposed in this paper is
also fairly linear for the metallicity range of our sample. Despite
the predicted intrinsic linearity in the chemical evolution between
helium and these heavy elements, some objects seem to be clear
outliers in the relation. In what follows we propose reasons that
could explain these outliers.

The top panel of Fig. 9 shows the regression of helium vs
oxygen abundances. Indicated are the objects that were excluded
from the ﬁt. The galaxies with the higher O/H abundance appear
to display a lower than expected Y abundance. All these objects
were observed with Conﬁguration I, which does not reach the
[OI I ] λλ3726˚A, 3729˚A doublet. Consequently, in these low ioniza-
++/H
+ there is a greater uncertainty
tion objects, where O
in the O+ as its value depends on weak lines. The temperatures
deduced for them are also the lowest of the sample. Among them
is M RK689, having the largest error bars both in O and in Y
and for which we derived the highest O/H value, so this object
weights heavily in the linear ﬁt for the regression. For all these
reasons, we did not include it in the ﬁt. Below we discuss other
objects that were excluded from the ﬁnal regression.

+ > O

+/H

The middle panel of Fig. 9 shows the helium vs. nitrogen
regression. Two objects, SHOC220 and PH L293, show indica-
tions of complex kinematics. PH L293 has been extensively an-
alyzed by Terlevich et al. (2014). Its spectrum shows two very
broad (∼ 1000 km/s and ∼ 4000 km/s) Hα components which the

authors argue are generated by a young and dense expanding su-
pershell or a stationary cooling wind, both driven by the young
cluster wind. The galaxy SHOC220 displays similarly intense
wide Hα components. Since these broad components, overlap the
[N I I] λλ6548˚A, 6583˚A lines, these galaxies were excluded from the
Y − N regression.

Finally, the bottom panel shows the Y vs. S regression where
all objects are included even when for several objects the telluric
correction for the [SI I I] λλ9069, 9532˚A lines could not be per-
formed. This can be appreciated on the observed ratios between
these lines in Table 4. For these objects, the theoretical relation
between both lines was used based on the line of the doublet that
falls on the least perturbed sky region. SHOC036 and SHOC263
were observed during adverse conditions and none of the [SI I I ]
lines were detected.

In all three panels in Fig. 9 a few objects appear to show
a helium abundance distinctively above the linear ﬁt. These Y-
enhanced objects occupy a diﬀerent position for each regression:.
They fall in the low metallicity edge of the He − O plot bue on
the high metallicity one for the He − N plot. Fig. 10 shows the
N/O ratio versus y. The majority of the objects occupy a narrow
band, ∆N/O ≈ 0.025 of about but for those objects with y > 0.09,
the N/O ratio has a larger dispersion. This phenomenon is ob-
served in both the low and high metallicity galaxies. Three of
these objects: SHOC575, SHOC579 and SHOC022, are identiﬁed
as Wolf-Rayet galaxies (W R038, W R039 and W R057) in Brinch-
mann et al. (2008). Detecting WR features using single slit ob-
servations is a challenging task, since the slit must be precisely
located in order to ﬁnd the stars. Even the well observed galaxy
I Zw18 deﬁed WR detection for a long time, until the work by
Izotov et al. (1997) and Legrand et al. (1997). These three WR
galaxies are included in P´erez-Montero et al. (2013) in their study
of the pollution of the interstellar medium by WR stars. Our de-
rived values log (N /O) = −0.91 ± 0.05, −0.82 ± 0.1, −1.71 ± 0.08

agree within uncertainties with theirs log (N /O) = 0.87 ± 0.27,
−0.80 ± 0.20, −1.48 ± 0.26 obtained on the basis of integral ﬁeld
spectroscopy. P´erez-Montero et al. (2013) concluded that while
the oxygen abundance in these galaxies is uniform in scales of the
order of several kpc, the N /O ratio is not homogeneous. Higher
nitrogen excess was found at the spaxels close to the WR. Further
study, beyond the scope of this work, will probably determine how
these objects attained their helium enrichment, but it is clear that
these objects have an impact on the regressions. On the Y − O ﬁt
these galaxies tend to increase the YP extrapolation while on the
Y − N relation they decrease it. Consequently, we have excluded
the six galaxies with N/O excess (see Fig. 10) from all the YP
linear regressions. These are: SHOC579, SHOC575, SHOC588,
SHOC592, SHOC036 and SHOC220. SHOC022 and IZwicky18
are still included even when they show the presence of WR stars.
As they don’t present any anomaly in their N /O values, we as-
sumed that our observations do not include contaminated regions.
In the Y − S regression these objects seem to have a helium enrich-
ment. In contrast, their sulfur abundances do not seem to diverge
from the rest of the sample, unlike in the oxygen and nitrogen
cases. For consistency, however, these objects were excluded as
outliers from all the linear regressions. Still, they have been in-
cluded in Fig. 9 with dashed uncertainty bars.

4.7 Linear regression

The helium abundance, helium mass fraction and the abundances
of O, N and S are given in Table 7. Two helium mass fractions
were calculated for each object. From the mass fraction formula
(X + Y + Z = 1) it can be derived that:

Y =

(1 − Z)

4 H e I
H I
1 + 4 H e I
H I

(30)

where it is common to express Z as a function of the oxygen abun-
dance: Z ∼ 20O/H or a similar expression using N (see eq. 28).
Izotov et al. (2013) suggest a modiﬁcation of the classical expres-
sion using an empirical oxygen-metallicity relation, Z = f (O/Z).
In order to use sulphur as an alternative metallicity tracer we
deﬁne:

Z ∼ 20

(31)

The oxygen to sulphur ratio was studied by D´ıaz et al. (1991)

for the high metallicity star forming regions in M51. Their result
was conﬁrmed recently by Dors et al. (2016) for a large sample
of Blue Compact Dwarfs. They obtain (cid:104)log (S/O)(cid:105) = −1.53 ± 0.03
and (cid:104)log (S/O)(cid:105) = −1.78 ± 0.02 for high and low metallicity HII
regions respectively. The low metallicity value is used in eq. 31
for our objects. The Y values calculated using O or S (see Table
8) diﬀer on a slightly larger dispersion when using S, where the
error on the S/O gradient is taken into account. To compute the
linear regression we used the curve f it routine in the scipy pack-
age (Jones et al. 2001–) within a bootstrap algorithm: in a ten
thousand iterations loop, a linear ﬁt was performed on the helium
mass fractions and heavy element abundances, generated from a
normal distribution for each galaxy. This process was repeated for
each Y − Z combination. From the output distributions, we deter-
mined the mean YP, Z and the 1σ uncertainty for each element
regression.

The ﬁrst three rows in Table 8 show the primordial helium
abundance determinations using one of the three elements as
metallicity proxy. Column (3) in this table displays the num-
ber of objects included in that regression. A good agreement
is obtained from the three regressions: YP, O = 0.246 ± 0.005,
YP, N = 0.251±0.005, YP, S = 0.244±0.006 within their uncertainty.
By using O and S as metallicity proxy to determine YP, we obtain
similar values, while using N results in a slightly larger YP . Lim-
iting the regressions to the 17 objects in our sample having oxy-
gen, nitrogen and sulfur abundance determinations we get slightly
larger mean values: YP, O = 0.248 ± 0.006, YP, N = 0.252 ± 0.005 and
YP, S = 0.246 ± 0.006. As already discussed, most of the sample for
this work has been obtained with observations designed ad-hoc
to measure the [SII] and [SIII] lines, and as a consequence our
preferred regression is the one obtained using S:
YP, S = 0.244±0.006

(32)

We obtain good agreement within uncertainties with the
most recent work on the topic using a Y − O regression. The lat-
est result from Peimbert et al. (2016) is YP, O = 0.2446±0.0029
including the eﬀect of temperature ﬂuctuations (that would de-
crease YP by a value between 0.003 and 0.006). The MCMC
helium abundance determination from Aver et al. (2015) gives
YP, O = 0.2449 ± 0.004 using observations and the oxygen abun-
dance calculation from Izotov et al. (2014). Izotov and colleagues
obtain YP, O = 0.2551 ± 0.0022, a higher value which they claim it
might require non-standard physics at the time of Big Bang nucle-

osynthesis. Their regression includes the largest number of objects
and their observations reached the near-IR HeI λ10830˚A line. As-
suming a standard cold dark matter paradigm the Planck collab-
oration provides a (model dependent) value of YP, B B N Pl a nc k =
0.24467±0.0002 (see Planck Collaboration et al. 2016). All three
regressions agree with this result, within their errors. The mean
values obtained both using S and O are closer to the Planck value,
while we obtain a larger YP value using N . This could be due to
a selective N enrichment in these objects, but chemical evolution
corrections fall beyond our analysis, on account of the uncertain-
ties in all YP, Z determinations.

It may be appreciated from this analysis, that deviant ob-
jects both in Y and Z have a large impact in the regression. This
is partly due to the restricted range in metallicity for our sample
objects. It would be interesting to include in the future higher
metallicity objects (see Carigi & Peimbert 2010) even when for
such cases deriving the O abundance will become more diﬃcult
(see, e.g. H¨agele et al. 2008). One of the advantages of including
sulphur is that its abundance can be measured with reasonable
accuracy in metal rich, lower ionization HII regions, increasing
the baseline for the linear ﬁt.

As discussed by Peimbert et al. (2007b) the third most im-
portant source of error in determining YP lies in the extrapolation
of the Y values to zero metallicity. To add further insight into this
uncertainty source, we propose to apply a multiple/multivariable
linear regression model. In this framework, a linear relation is
established between multiple independent variables and a depen-
dent variable expressed as a scalar. The approach is valid for this
analysis as the abundances involved are independent. In these ﬁt-
tings, we employ the helium fraction by mass calculated using
sulfur (Y = YS ) and we apply a similar boot-strap algorithm to
estimate YP . The possible combinations are displayed in Table
8. Even though including additional elements does not seem to
reduce the uncertainty, the predicted YP agrees better with the
results by Aver et al. (2015) and Peimbert et al. (2016). This
is particularly true for the YP, O−N −S = 0.245±0.007 regression.
This result vindicates the addition of more elements as metal-
licity tracers, in particular sulphur. In a forthcoming paper we
plan to apply MCMC sampling to the Y − Z regressions in or-
der to explore how the addition of more elements aﬀects the YP
calculation.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We observed with ISIS in the WHT in two diﬀerent con-
ﬁgurations, 27 low metallicity young HII galaxies selected
from SDSS - DR12. The objective was to reach the near-IR
[SI I I ] λλ9069, 9532˚A lines to estimate T [SI I I ], the abundances
of S and He and to derive YP , the primordial abundance of he-
lium from dY/d Z using for the ﬁrst time S as a tracer of metal
abundance.

The selected sample with

represents very
young bursts. In these objects, the nebular continuum contributes
as much as the youngest stellar population to the continuum and
needs to be taken into account.

EW (Hα) > 200˚A

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

The nebular continuum was calculated from ﬁrst principles
and removed from the observed spectra. The helium abundance
was derived using the direct method. The underlying absorption
on the recombination lines was subtracted using a SSP ﬁt which
provided a complete characterization of the stellar population for
the spectra obtained with the instrumental setup that covered a
wide spectral base. For the conﬁguration that covered a smaller
wavelength range, the older stellar population was more diﬃcult
to characterize and subtract. We hope this will improve in the
near future with stellar bases which go beyond the 7000˚A bound-
ary.

We could determine from our data two temperature diagnos-
tics: T [OI I I ] and T [SI I I ]. A model with two ionization zones
was considered. When the errors for both temperatures were sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent, an empirical relation was used to derive the
temperature from the more precise determination and the error
was propagated.

We determined the ionic and total abundances for oxygen
and nitrogen. For sulphur, in high ionization zones the S3+ com-
ponent cannot be neglected. We proposed an ICF
based on
the Ar 3+/Ar 2+ ratio, appropriate for our wavelength range. This
was derived using Cloudy photo-ionization models (Ferland et al.
2013) with PopStar evolutionary models Mart´ın-Manj´on et al.
(2010).

S3+(cid:17)

(cid:16)

Linear regressions were found between Y and O, Y and N and
Y and S. Six objects: SHOC036, SHOC220, SHOC592, SHOC588,
SHOC575 and SHOC579 show helium excess. Three of them are
known to have WR stars probably contaminating the interstellar
medium. These objects also show a nitrogen to oxygen excess
(N /O > 0.04), and (H e/H > 0.09). They were excluded from the
seven linear regressions.

The results for primordial helium from the three regres-
sions are YP, O = 0.246 ± 0.005, YP, N = 0.252 ± 0.005, YP, S =
0.244±0.006.; they agree with each other within errors and also
with the derived value from Planck within standard Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis prescriptions. A multivariable regression using
all three elements results in YO−N −S = 0.245±0.007. The novel
use of S as proxy for the metal abundance and to derive YP has
proved successful.

In a forthcoming paper (Fern´andez et al. in preparation) we
will include true error propagation between all the steps involved
to correct better the telluric features and to improve the sul-
phur abundance determination. We are also improving the ﬁt for
the underlying stellar population and follow Izotov et al. (2014)
and Aver et al. (2015) multidimensional schemes to compute the
helium abundance. This procedure can simultaneously quantify
the diﬀerent processes contributing to the emission in the helium
lines.

As future improvements to the programe, we plan to in-
clude in forthcoming observation campaigns, the relatively strong
HeIλ10830 ˚A line with high sensitivity to electron density and ob-
vious advantage to derive helium abundance (see Izotov et al.
2014; Aver et al. 2015). We will also use new stellar libraries that
extend up to near-infrared wavelengths to subtract better the stel-
lar population contamination to the emission line spectrum. We

are aware of tools such as skycorr developed by Noll et al. (2014),
which can model and remove airglow contamination. This contri-
bution is instrument-independent and it will allow in the future
to propagate the error in the sky subtraction procedure.
