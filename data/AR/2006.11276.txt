ABSTRACT

We analyze rapid-cadence, multiwavelength photometry of AR Scorpii from three
observatories, covering ﬁve observing seasons. We measure the arrival times of the sys-
tem’s beat pulses and use them to compute an updated ephemeris. The white dwarf
spin-down rate is estimated with an uncertainty of only 4%. These results conﬁrm,
beyond any doubt, that the white dwarf’s spin period is increasing at the rate consis-
tent with by that of Stiller et al. (2018). We study the evolution of the beat pulse’s
color index across the orbit. The color of the primary pulse maxima varies signiﬁ-
cantly across the orbit, with the peaks being bluer after superior conjunction than
in the ﬁrst half of the orbit. Speciﬁcally, at orbital phase 0.5, the color index of the
primary pulse shows a very sharp discontinuity towards bluer indices. This supports
the Potter & Buckley (2018b) synchrotron emission model where the two emitting
poles diﬀer signiﬁcantly in color. However, no corresponding jump in the color of the
secondary pulses is seen. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the arrival times of the
pulses can diﬀer by as much as 6 s in simultaneous u and r photometry, depending on
the binary orbital phase. If left uncorrected, this wavelength-dependent timing oﬀset
could lead to erroneous measurements of the spin-period derivative, particularly with
heterogeneous datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

AR Scorpii (AR Sco hereafter) is a binary system consisting
of a low-mass red dwarf star and a rapidly spinning white
dwarf (WD) with highly unusual characteristics (Marsh et
al. 2016). The system has a 3.56-hour orbital period, and
a spectacular variation in brightness on a two minute time-
scale that is related to the spin of the WD and its magnetic
interaction with the red dwarf secondary. The pulsed emis-
sion is seen over a broad range of wavelengths from radio to
soft X-rays (Marsh et al. 2016; Takata et al. 2018; Marcote
et al. 2017; Stanway et al. 2018; Stiller et al. 2018). One
of the most unusal features of AR Sco is that the pulsed
emission does not appear to be due to accretion on to the
WD (Marsh et al. 2016), as is seen in intermediate polar-
type cataclysmic variable star (CVs). The strongly linearly
polarized pulses are consistent with synchrotron radiation
coming from near the WD Buckley et al. (2017), although
where and how the electrons are accelerated remains uncer-
tain. Garnavich et al. (2019) detected slingshot prominences
originating from the red dwarf star that implies a magnetic

ﬁeld of several hundred Gauss. This suggests the possibility
that magnetic reconnection events between the WD and sec-
ondary star ﬁelds are the source of the energetic electrons.

Marsh et al. (2016) and Stiller et al. (2018) detected
a secular decrease in the period of the pulses that imply
that the WD spin rate is decreasing and that the dynam-
ical energy loss is suﬃcient to explain the excess luminos-
ity seen from the system. Although the WD spin periods
of some intermediate polars have been observed to vary on
timescales of years (Patterson et al. 2020), the underlying
physical mechanisms are very diﬀerent than those in AR Sco.
Spin-period derivatives in accreting intermediate polars are
widely understood to be caused by the competition between
a spin-up torque from accretion and a spin-down torque
from the WD’s magnetic ﬁeld lines dragging through the
accretion ﬂow. In contrast, AR Sco has been called a “WD
pulsar” because, just as in neutron-star pulsars, its pulsed,
non-thermal electromagnetic emission is exceptionally pe-
riodic and appears to be powered by the spin-down of a
compact stellar component.

Y. Gaibor et al.

Here, we combine observations of AR Sco obtained from
several sources over ﬁve seasons to provide tight constraints
on the spin-down rate of the WD and improve the pulse
ephemerides. Further, we search for color dependence in the
pulse timings and color variations in the pulses over an orbit.

2 DATA

The rapid variability of the AR Sco pulses means that it is
imperative to sample the light curve with fast cadence obser-
vations. It is also critical for the time-stamps of individual
observations to be accurate. For these reasons we have re-
stricted the sources of data to three observatories: South
African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), the William
Herschel Telescope (WHT), and the Sarah L. Krizmanich
Telescope (SLKT) on the University of Notre Dame cam-
pus. As noted by Stiller et al. (2018), the shutter lag of
the camera used on the SLKT was consistent from night-to-
night, but its value was uncertain on the level of ∼1 s, so
these data are analyzed separately from the other sets.

Times for all the observations have been converted to
Barycentric Julian Day (BJD) in Barycentric Dynamical
Time to remove the Earth’s motion and light-travel time
eﬀects (for a detailed discussion of these corrections, see
Eastman, Siverd, & Gaudi 2010).

2.1 SLKT

We analyze photometry data from the 80-cm Sarah L. Kriz-
manich Telescope (SLKT) obtained over four seasons from
2016 to 2019. Stiller et al. (2018) published results from the
SLKT data taken from 2016, 2017, and 2018, and here we
add new observations from the 2019 season. A total of 40.3
hours of data was obtained from 35 observing runs with a
typical cadence of 5 to 6 sec. The data was taken unﬁltered
which corresponded to an eﬀective central wavelength simi-
lar to the Johnson-Cousins R band.

2.2 SAAO

We analyze photometry data from the South African Astro-
nomical Observatory (SAAO) using the high-speed photo-
multiplier instrument (HIPPO; Potter et al. 2008). Obser-
vations of AR Sco analyzed here were obtained from 2016
to 2019 with a typical cadence of 2 sec for a total data set
covering 17.3 hours. The data was taken unﬁlter or with an
OG570 longpass ﬁlter using a red-sensitive photomultiplier
detector. Some of these observations have been published in
Potter & Buckley (2018a). This photometry had a number
of noise glitches that were identiﬁed and removed. This was
done by running a 5-point median ﬁlter over the data and
deleting individual observations that exceeded 15σ from the
distribution of deviations about the median.

2.3 WHT

We also used the WHT ULTRACam photometry of 2015
(Marsh et al. 2016), which was taken with the r, g, and u
ﬁlters. This observing run covered 80% of an orbit, with
typical cadence of 1.3 sec. For our analysis, we used the
r-band data to best match the red color of the SAAO data.

We refer to the combined SAAO and WHT r-band datasets
as SAAO+WHT-r.

3 ANALYSIS

3.1 The Beat Ephemeris

Power spectra of the light curve of AR Sco are dominated
by a frequency at νspin =8.5282 mHz attributed to the spin
of the WD and a frequency at νbeat =8.4603 mHz iden-
tiﬁed as the “beat” between the WD spin and the orbital
period (Marsh et al. 2016; Potter & Buckley 2018b; Stiller et
al. 2018) 1. The beat-pulse proﬁle is conspicuously double-
peaked, with a strong primary pulse and a weaker secondary
pulse during each 118.2 s (1.97 min) beat cycle. A partic-
ularly excellent example of this structure is shown in the
WHT/ULTRACAM data in Figure 1.

Stiller et al. (2018) showed that the most precise method
of estimating the change in spin period is to measure the
timing of individual pulse peaks over a long baseline. To
ﬁnd the brightness peaks, we iteratively create a window
of 55 s around the predicted peaks, based on the Stiller
et al. (2018) ephemeris. Then, we ﬁt a Gaussian function
to the points to estimate the precise time of the peak. We
ﬁnd the corresponding orbital phase by using the Marsh et
al. (2016) orbital ephemeris. The resulting beat-pulse tim-
ings and corresponding uncertainties are shown in Table 1
(SAAO+WHT-r) and in Table 2 (SLKT). The quality of
the averaged timings depend on several factors, including
the number of beat pulses measured in the run and their
orbital phases. There are about 108 primary beat pulses per
binary orbit, so the SAAO+WHT observations cover all or
most of an orbit, but the SLKT observations tend to have
captured half an orbit or less.

Timings of the primary beat pulse show that its arrival
times vary systematically over an orbital cycle (Takata et
al. 2017; Stiller et al. 2018). Stiller et al. (2018) successfully
modeled the primary pulse’s phase shifts as the interfer-
ence between the beat and spin frequencies across the orbit,
although other causes are possible. To correct for orbital-
phase dependence of the pulse arrival times, we computed
a Fourier-series representation of the pulse O−C (observed-
calculated)2 as a function of orbital phase, used it to calcu-
late the systematic oﬀset at the orbital phase of the observa-
tion, and subtracted this value from the O−C of each pulse,
as was done in Stiller et al. (2018). This process was applied
separately to the SAAO+WHT-r data and the SKLT data
(Figure 2).

For each individual night of data we apply a linear ﬁt to
the timings and reduce the result to a single average timing
for the night referenced to the ﬁrst peak of that run. For
the error bars of each night, we had to account for the ap-
preciable dispersion of timings in the O − C around orbital
phases 0.05 and 0.55. We began by splitting the O −C of the
total data set into the following orbital phase bands (that
match changes in dispersion as seen in Fig. 2): 0-0.15, 0.15-
0.47, 0.47-0.65, and 0.65-1. Then, we calculated the standard
deviation, σorb, within each band and weighted each pulse

timing by 1/σorb in the linear extrapolations back to the
reference peak for that night. Thus, beat pulses occurring
during ‘noisy’ sections of the orbit have less inﬂuence on the
average beat timing from an observing run. The uncertainty
on the average timing for a night was calculated using the
square root of the covariance matrix from the linear ﬁt for
each night of data. The SAAO+WHT-r data consist of sin-
gle nights in each season, so the timings total ﬁve points
with uncertainties of about ±0.5s. The SKLT data were ob-
tained on 35 nights over four seasons, each with an average
uncertainty of ±0.8s.

To estimate the beat period, we ﬁt a ﬁrst-order poly-
nomial to the SAAO+WHT-r and the SLKT timings sep-
arately. The data sets are analyzed separately because the
consistent, but uncertain, shutter oﬀset in the SLKT timing
might result in systematic error in a joint ﬁt. The residuals
to the linear ﬁt are shown in the top panel of Figure 3, and
there is an obvious systematic curvature from a nonzero pe-
riod derivative. The χ2 parameter from the SLKT data is
very high at 542 with 33 degrees of freedom (dof). The lin-

From the quadratic coeﬃcient, α, we can calculate ˙Pbeat
and from that the frequency derivative. Since the frequency
is the inverse of the period, then the beat frequency deriva-
tive is ˙ν = − ˙P
P 2 . The two frequency derivatives from the
two independent data sets are:

˙νbeat(SAAO + WHT − r) = −4.66(19) × 10−17 Hz s−1

˙νbeat(SLKT) = −4.98(17) × 10−17 Hz s−1

and the other ﬁt coeﬃcients and their uncertainties are
shown in Table 3. The last column in the table shows the
diﬀerence between the SAAO+WHT-r value and the SKLT
value divided by the total uncertainty. The frequency deriva-
tives and the periods diﬀer by about one standard deviation.
The diﬀerence in the time of zero epoch are nearly six stan-
dard deviations oﬀ. We attribute this to a combination of
two eﬀects: (1) the shutter lag in the SLKT’s camera, which
lacks dedicated hardware to accurately measure the times-
tamp of each exposure, and (2) the wavelength dependence
of the pulse timings, which we discuss in Sec. 3.2.1.

3.2 Systematic Uncertainties in the Spin-Down

Rate

3.2.1 Pulse Times vs Wavelength

Combining observations of AR Sco from several telescopes,
cameras, and ﬁlter systems may lead to systematic pulse
timing errors. For example, Stiller et al. (2018) found camera
shutter-lag diﬀerences between data sets that generate O−C
timing oﬀsets. If the pulse shapes are color-dependent, then
light curves taken through diﬀerent ﬁlters will show timing
shifts that are not related to the WD spin-down.

The multi-ﬁlter imaging obtained by ULTRACAM on
the WHT provides an excellent test of the dependence of
pulse peak times on wavelength. Photometry of AR Sco was
obtained simultaneously in SDSS u, g, and r ﬁlters, making
it possible to estimate a pulse-by-pulse timing shift between
ﬁlters. We focus on r and u-bands, the two ﬁlters with the
widest span of wavelength. As shown in Figure 1, the pri-
mary pulses are clearly present in both ﬁlters, with the main
diﬀerences being in the pulse amplitudes. Secondary pulses
can be less deﬁned than the primary peaks and can even
disappear at some orbital phases for the u-band data.

WHT-r respectively. As found by Stiller et al. (2018), the
beat period is clearly not constant.

To measure the beat period change and estimate its
uncertainty from this set of data, we calculate an ephemeris
including a second order term in the form Tmax = T0 +
P E + αE2 , where Tmax is the beat pulse time at max-
imum, E is the epoch number, P and T0 are the period
and date at epoch zero, respectively. The parameter α is
¯Pbeat ˙Pbeat where ¯Pbeat is the average beat pe-
equivalent to 1
2
riod and ˙Pbeat is the period derivative. We apply a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm on the data sets to
determine beat ephemerides and estimate parameter uncer-
tainties. The MCMC results (Figure 4) indicate that the
α coeﬃcents and the estimated periods for the two data
sets are fairly consistent. However, T0 parameters are sig-
niﬁcantly oﬀset from each other. With the uncertainties in
the ﬁnal digits shown in parentheses for each parameter, the
SAAO+WHT-r ephemeris is:

Figure 5. Times of primary pulses in the r-ﬁlter relative to the
times of peaks in the u-ﬁlter based on the ULTRACAM data.
Before orbital phase 0.5 there is a small scatter in the relative
peak times implying a timing precision of ±0.6s. In the ﬁrst half
of the orbit the times of the red peaks shift from arriving a second
later than the blue to nearly 2s earlier. In the second half of the
orbit the relative peak times are more erratic although trends are
still apparent.

for the beat ephemeris analysis, we ﬁt the peaks for the
u-band photometry and plot the diﬀerence in peak times
between the two ﬁlters in Figure 5 as a function of orbital
phase. Note that the ULTRACAM data from 2005 covered
only 80% of an orbit. There are clearly systematic pulse
timing diﬀerences between the two ﬁlters, and these show
a complicated relation with orbital phase. Between orbital
phases 0.2 and 0.5, the diﬀerence in pulse times between the
r and u-bands shows a very small scatter and a clear trend.
At ﬁrst, the pulse arrives earliest at blue wavelengths, but
by orbital phase 0.5 the pulse arrives ﬁrst in the red ﬁlter. A
linear ﬁt to the trend shows that the diﬀerence in peak times
between these ﬁlters amounts to 3.5 s over the ﬁrst half of
the orbit, or 3% of the beat period. A similar wavelength
dependent phase shift has been seen by Marsh (2019).

Taking into account the linear trend, the standard de-
viation in the relative timings over the ﬁrst half the orbit
is 0.64 s. This scatter is small because we are looking at
the same pulses over the same time windows and the only
variable is the wavelength.

The scatter in the relative pulse times between ﬁlters
becomes large after orbital phase 0.5. This jump in the tim-
ing scatter amplitude after phase 0.5 is seen even in a single
ﬁlter and reﬂects a fundamental change in light curve prop-
erties at superior conjunction. Between orbital phases 0.5
and 0.65, the red pulse can arrive as much as 6 s ahead
of the blue, while at other times they peak simultaneously.
Over the second half of the orbit, the relative times of the
red and blue pulses oscillate between ±2s.

The cause of these color variations is certainly not clear,
but their existence may be a clue to the nature of the beat
and spin pulses. For example, if the beat and spin pulses
are adding together over the ﬁrst half of the orbit, then
the higher frequency spin pulses would switch from arriving
behind the beat pulse to ahead. So the color timings in the
ﬁrst half can be explained as the spin pulse being redder
than the beat pulse.

To avoid systematic errors in the beat pulse times, one
should be consistent in the ﬁlters used for the pulse timings.
Timing diﬀerences of seconds between the r and u ﬁlters are
seen over certain orbital phases, and errors of this size would

SLKT photometry was all taken with an unﬁltered CCD. So
our timing analysis minimizes any systematic color depen-
dence on pulse times.

3.2.2 Ruling out a proper-motion contribution to ˙P

Previous studies of the spin-down have not considered the
possibility that some fraction of the observed ˙P may be at-
tributable to AR Sco’s proper motion (PM). The transverse
component of the relative space motion of a star produces a
time-varying radial velocity, and this varying Doppler shift
generates an apparent period derivative. Shklovskii (1970)
applied this eﬀect to period changes in the newly discovered
pulsars. More recently, Pajdosz (1995) discussed this anoma-
lous ˙P in the context of rapidly pulsating ZZ Ceti stars, but
it applies to rotational periods as well. Critically, a star’s
proper motion will always induce a positive ˙P term in stud-
ies of a periodic signal (Pajdosz 1995)—making it impor-
tant to examine whether AR Sco’s much-heralded positive
˙P might be attributed to this eﬀect.

Using Eq. 8 in Pajdosz (1995) and Gaia DR2 astrom-
etry, we ﬁnd that AR Sco’s proper motion induces a unit-
˙Ppm,beat = 9 × 10−17. This is
less beat period derivative of
four orders of magnitude smaller than the observed ˙Pbeat
and, therefore, it contributes an insigniﬁcant error to our
measurements of the WD’s spin-down. Likewise, when cal-
˙Ppm,orb is almost 700 times
culated for the orbital period,
too small to impact the constraints on the orbital-period
derivative from Peterson et al. (2019).

Although this eﬀect is far too small to measurably in-
ﬂuence AR Sco’s ˙P , it should be taken into account should
additional AR Sco-type objects be discovered with apparent
period derivatives.

3.3 Pseudo-Bolometric Flux

The ULTRACam photometry from 2015 obtained data in
the SDSS − r, SDSS − g, and SDSS − u simultaneously
and this permits an analysis of color variations and pseduo-
bolometric ﬂux estimates. We convert the uncalibrated ﬂux
measurements from the ULTRACam CCDs to magnitudes.
Here, we use the average spectrum of AR Sco covering nearly
an orbit (Garnavich et al. 2019) and assume the average
ﬂux in each ﬁlter matches the corresponding average ﬂux
densities in the spectra. The resulting light curves are shown
in Figure 1, along with a detailed comparison between the
SDSS − r and SDSS − u ﬁlters.

is indicated by the color of the symbol.

There are striking diﬀerences between the red and ul-
traviolet (UV) light curves of AR Sco. For example, over
the second half of the orbit, the amplitude of the primary
UV pulses are larger than the amplitude at red wavelengths.
Stiller et al. (2018) and Potter & Buckley (2018a) showed
that in unﬁltered (dominated by red wavelengths) photom-
etry the pulse amplitude peaks at orbital phase 0.25 with
a weaker maximum around phase 0.8. At UV wavelengths,
this is reversed and the strongest peaks occur at the late
orbital phases (Figure 1).

The secondary pulses also show signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in amplitude between the red and UV bands. In the red, the
primary pulses weaken after orbital phase 0.5 and reach a
comparable amplitude as the secondary pulses. But in the
UV, the primary pulses remain quite robust and it is the
secondary pulses that weaken to the point of being unde-
tectable. Clearly, the primary peaks will have u − r colors
that are quite blue while the secondary pulses will become
more red.

The ULTRACam high-cadence multi-color photometry
allows an estimate of the total ﬂux from AR Sco over a
broad wavelength range. The SDSS − u, SDSS − g, and
SDSS −r bands are centered at 3557 ˚A, 4825 ˚A, and 6261 ˚A
respectively (Dhillon et al. 2007). We convert the magni-
tudes in each ﬁlter to their corresponding ﬂux densities and
ﬁt a quadratic polynomial at each set of exposures. The
SDSS − u band images had twice the exposure time as
the other ﬁlters so their magnitudes were interpolated to
the same cadence as SDSS − r. The quadratic ﬁt was then
integrated between 2500 ˚A and 7000 ˚A to give the pseudo-
bolometric ﬂux. Assuming a distance of 117.8 pc, we convert
to a luminosity (erg s−1). The resulting light curve is shown
in Fig 6.

The bolometric light curve suggests that the primary
pulses are more uniform in amplitude around an orbit than
is seen at red wavelengths. This is clearly demonstrated in

MNRAS 496, 1–9 (2020)

Figure 7. The primary pulse amplitude from the pseudo-
bolometric luminosity. The amplitude is the magnitude diﬀerence
between the minimum and maximum luminosities for each pulse.
The amplitude ratio between the u-band and r-band ﬂuxes is
shown as a color for each point. Starting at phase 0.50, the pulse
amplitudes are dominated by blue wavelengths when compared
with the ﬁrst half of the orbit. Thus, the bolometric pulse ampli-
tudes are fairly symmetric about superior conjunction, in contrast
to light curves obtained at red wavelengths.

Figure 7 where the diﬀerence between a pulse maximum and
its nearest minimum is displayed. The weakest pulse ampli-
tudes are seen soon after orbital phase 0.5. There is a short
spike in blue-dominated pulses at orbital phase 0.52, but it
is not clear from this one orbit if that repeats every cycle.
The color of the points indicates the relative pulse ampli-

tude in the u and r bands. The pulses are dominated by red
emission during the ﬁrst half of the orbit, but after orbital
phase 0.5 the primary pulses are strongest at blue wave-
lengths. The sharp transition in color at binary conjunction
is clearly seen in Figure 7.

The variation in colors of the primary and secondary
peaks are shown in Figure 8. The u−r color of the secondary
pulses reach a minimum (most blue) at orbital phase 0.51
and follow a parabolic trajectory between orbital phases 0.2
and 0.8. The u − r color of the primary pulse peaks are very
similar to that of the secondary peaks over the ﬁrst half of
the orbit, but are signiﬁcantly more blue over the second
half. As noted above, there appears a discontinuity in the
colors at orbital phase 0.5 where the peak colors suddenly
become 0.3 mag more blue than the secondary peaks. Fig-
ure 8 also indicates that the scatter in the primary peak
colors shows a marked increase beyond orbital phase 0.5.

The color of the minima between pulses is very well-
behaved (Figure 8). The primary minimum is deﬁned as the
faintest bolometric ﬂux following a primary peak and the
secondary minimum follows directly after a secondary peak.
Both primary and secondary minima follow a parabolic-like
color variation over an orbit with the bluest color occuring
just before orbital phase 0.5. The u − r color gets extremely
red near orbital phase 1.0, and the primary minima appear
marginally more blue than the secondary minima between
phases 0.8 and 1.0.

The color discontinuity in pulse peaks at orbital phase
0.5 suggests that the viewing angle geometry plays an im-
portant role in light curve of AR Sco. Orbital phase 0.5 is
at superior conjunction when the secondary star is precisely
on the far side of the WD as seen from the Earth. This dis-
continuity at superior conjunction is also seen in the peak
timings as shown in Figure 5. The color and timing dis-
continuities suggest that a pulse component comes into, or
disappears from, our view near conjunction. The strength-
ening of a blue component immediately after syzygy would
explain the reduced color indices of the peaks in the second
half of the orbit, as well as the rapid change in peak times
as seen in Figure 5.

In the model developed by Potter & Buckley (2018b),
the beat pulses consist of synchrotron radiation that orig-
inates in the outer magnetosphere as relativistic electrons
accelerate along ﬁeld lines towards magnetic mirror points.
Although the resulting synchrotron emission is ﬁxed within
the WD’s rotational rest frame, it is enhanced whenever one
of the WD’s magnetic poles sweeps past the secondary, re-
ceiving an injection of relativistic electrons. Due to a combi-
nation of our changing viewing angle and synchrotron beam-
ing eﬀects, the amplitude of the beat pulses is largest near
orbital phases ∼ 0.3 and ∼ 0.8. One of the most interesting
predictions of this model is that near superior conjunction,
the magnetic pole responsible for the primary beat pulse
changes—i.e., the observed synchrotron radiation comes

from the opposite magnetic hemisphere. The abrupt pole-
switch near superior conjunction predicted by their model
could therefore explain why there is such a sharp disconti-
nuity in the pulse color at the same orbital phase. However,
although we might also anticipate a simultaneous switch to
redder colors for the secondary pulses, no such jump in color
is seen.

4 CONCLUSION

We have measured beat frequency derivative of −4.82(18) ×
10−17Hz s−1, by combining ﬁve years of data from SAAO,
WHT and the SLKT. This is consistent with the −5.14(32)×
10−17Hz s−1 estimated by Stiller et al. (2018), but our es-
timate has nearly twice the precision. Constraints on the
change in the binary orbital frequency (Peterson et al. 2019)
imply that the change in the beat is identical to the spin-
down frequency of the WD, which is now detected at more
than 25σ.

We ﬁnd that the timing of the beat pulses is wavelength
dependent, with variations of more than ±2s in peak pulse
arrival times between UV and red bands as a function of
orbital phase. The wavelength dependence on timing may
induce systematic errors in future ephemeris determinations
unless care is taken in obtaining consistent data. This color
dependence on pulse arrivals may also be useful in constrain-
ing the emission mechanism and geometry in AR Sco. The
pulsed emission from AR Sco shows systematic color vari-
ations over an orbit. The primary pulses tend to be redder
before superior conjunction when compared to pulses after
conjunction. The change in color is discontinuous at orbital
phase 0.5. In contrast, the secondary pulses show a contin-
uous color variation with the bluest peaks occurring at su-
perior conjunction. This jump in the colors of the primary
pulses as the binary passes superior conjunction suggests
that our view of the emission source undergoes a discon-
tinuous change as may happen by viewing a switch in the
magnetic pole dominating the emission.
