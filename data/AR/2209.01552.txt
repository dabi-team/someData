Abstract: Hawking evaporation of primordial black hole (PBH), with mass 3 × 10−17 (cid:46)
MPBH/M(cid:12) (cid:46) 7 × 10−17 and fractional abundance 0.01 (cid:46) fPBH (cid:46) 0.5, well reproduces
511 keV gamma-ray excess from galaxy center.
In this work, we investigated the pro-
duction mechanism of PBHs base on the ﬁrst-order phase transition induced by quartic
eﬀective thermal potential of a scalar ﬁeld in dark sector. We found the phase transition
with vacuum energy, O(1) (cid:46) B1/4/MeV (cid:46) O(100), produces the desired PBH mass and
abundance fraction. Correlated signatures of gravitational wave and extragalactic gamma-
ray from phase transition and black hole evaporation, respectively, are within µAres and
AMEGO/e-ASTROGAM projected sensitivities.

Since the lack of observational evidence of WIMP (Weakly interacting massive particle),
primordial black hole (PBH) gradually becomes one of the promising dark matter (DM)
candidate [1–7] and provides convincing explanation [8–10] for LIGO/Virgo [11–13] grav-
itational wave (GW) signals. Several production mechanisms have been proposed. After
inﬂation, PBHs can be generated through the collapse of the overdensity regions, which are
developed from the primordial ﬂuctuation re-entering the horizon [14, 15]. Other papers
discussed PBHs directly form following the bubble collisions of ﬁrst-order phase transition
(FOPT) [16–21].

In this work, we consider an alternative PBHs production mechanism from FOPT in
the early Universe. During FOPT, an intermediate state, dubbed as Fermi balls (FBs), were
formed via the expanding bubbles. Then, the attractive Yukawa interaction triggers a FB
collapsing into a PBH [22]. The success of FB formation requires the fermionic particles χ’s
being trapped and aggregated inside a false vacuum surrounding by the expanding bubbles
of true vacuum.
[23–26]. Since the Standard Model (SM) electroweak and QCD (quantum
chromodynamics) phase transitions are smooth crossovers, we therefore invoke the FOPT
being generated in the dark sector. Speciﬁcally, a commonly discussed quartic eﬀective
thermal potential of a scalar ﬁeld φ is adopted.
In addition, the scalar ﬁeld couples to
the χ through Yukawa interaction, which serves two purposes. First, the non-zero VEV
(vacuum expectation value) of the scalar increases the mass χ in the true vacuum, due
to the energy-momentum conservation at bubble wall, which keeps the χ’s in the false
vacuum if the mass diﬀerence is larger than the critical temperature of the FOPT. The
other purpose, the Yukawa interaction induces attractive force between χ’s and triggers the
collapse of a FB into a PBH. This instability of FB happened when the range of interaction
becomes comparable with the mean separation distance of χ’s in a FB [22].

On the astrophysical observations perspective, an excess amount of photons with en-
ergy 511 keV has been conﬁrmed from the central region of Milky Way by SPI/INTEGRAL [27].
If someone identiﬁed this as a result of electron-positron annihilation, it requires the in-
jection rate of 2 × 1043 non-relativistic positrons per second [29–33]. Various potential
astrophysical sources have been proposed for the excess, but encountered diﬃculties ex-
plaining the characteristic of the signal [34]. In addition, the MeV scale DM annihilation
is hardly consistent with cosmic microwave background observation [35]. Recently, it has
been suggested that the positrons responsible for the 511 keV line excess might be pro-
duced through the Hawking evaporation [38, 39] of PBHs [40–45]. Assuming the PBHs
distribution follows the NFW halo proﬁle and concentrates in the inner Galaxy. The PBH
mass of MPBH ∼ O(5 × 1016) g and the O(10−3) fraction of total DM abundance, has been
shown, not only produces the right amount of positron ﬂux but is also consistent with
existing limits of COMPTEL/INTEGRAL gamma-ray observations [40].

In this work, we aim to ﬁnd the corresponding parameters space under the FOPT
scenario, which generates the PBH mass and relic abundance to explain the 511 keV excess.
As a result, the correlated gamma-ray spectra form PBH evaporation and GW signals from
FOPT are predicted. This paper is organized as following: In section 2, base on NFW and
isothermal distributions, we scrutinize the preferred PBH mass and abundance fraction for
511 keV excess. The realization of PBH formation and correlated signals production are
discussed in section 3 and 4, respectively. Finally, we summarize the results in section 5.

Hawking emission describes a PBH thermally produce primary particles with masses lighter
than the PBH temperature TPBH = M 2

The secondary particles productions come from the decays or fragmentation of primary
particles (e.g e±, µ±, π±, π0). A PBH dominantly emits photons and neutrinos, but for
MPBH/M(cid:12) (cid:46) 10−16, PBH can signiﬁcantly produces e±. The emission rate of primary
particle i is given by [37, 38]

2.1 Galaxy center 511 keV line

The galaxy center 511 keV line observed by SPI/INTEGRAL [27] exceeds the astrophysical
contributions. In this paper, we focus on the explanation of PBHs in mass range from 1015 g
to 2 × 1017 g, which signiﬁcantly produce particles by Hawking evaporation. Positrons are
abundantly emitted from a PBH and more than 95% of them become non-relativistic via
ionization. Among the non-relativistic positrons, fraction of (1−f ) directly annihilate with
an electron to produce two 511 keV photons, while the others fraction of f ≈ 0.967 form a
positronium bound state with an electron [40]. Among the later case, 25% of positroniums
annihilate to form pair of 511 keV photons, and the rest 75% yield three photons with
energy less than 511 keV. As a Result, the number of 511 keV photons produced per
positron is

≈ 0.55 .

The ﬂux of 511 keV photons from PBHs near the galactic center, covers solid angle ∆Ω, is
formulated as

(2.5)

where Le+(MPBH) is the positron production rate from a PBH, fPBH be the fraction of
PBHs abundance to the DM relic abundance. The integrals are performed over solid angle
and along the line-of-sight. We assume the PBHs distribution follows the Navarro-Frenk-
White (NFW) DM halo proﬁle:

ρ(r) =

ρ0
(r/Rs)γ[1 + (r/Rs)]3−γ ,

(2.6)

where r is the distance from the galactic center, and the normalization parameter ρ0 adjusts
the DM density near our solar system, ρ = 0.4 GeV/cm3 at r = 8.25 kpc. Here, we ﬁx
γ = 1.6 and scale radius Rs = 20 kpc in this analysis. Combining with the galactic disk
contribution, the angular distribution of 511 keV line predicted from PBHs emission is
shown in Fig. 1. It distributes as a function of galactic latitude b after averaging over the
longitude proﬁle −8◦ < (cid:96) < +8◦ and is compared with the INTEGRAL data of photon
energy from 508.25 keV to 513.75 keV [27].

The best-ﬁt normalization for the 511 keV INTEGRAL data is obtained by the χ2

test, which is deﬁned by

the extragalactic gamma-ray, and thus is excluded by current upper bound of COMPTEL.

extragalactic photon contributions and compare with the current experimental data of
COMPTEL/EGRET/FermiLAT and future sensitivities of AMEGO/e-ASTROGAM as
well. The extragalactic photon contributions due to PBH is given by [28]

where ρDM = 1.27 GeVm−3 is the average dark matter density in the extragalactic medium.
From this expression, we can see the extragalactic photon ﬂux is independent from the
uncertainties of DM density proﬁle near the galactic center, thereby it provides more robust
prediction than the galactic one. The lower limit of temporal integral starts at the time
of last scattering, tCMB = 3.8 × 105 yr, after that photons decoupled from thermal plasma
and can propagate freely. Meanwhile, the upper limit of integral is set by the shorter
period of the lifetime of PBH (teva) or the age of Universe (t0 = 13.77 × 109 yr). Applying

3 First-order phase transition

The PBH can be produced through a two-step processes during FOPT which is induced
by the eﬀective thermal potential of a scalar φ in the hidden sector. The FB stems from
the aggregation of dark fermions χ’s and plays the role as intermediate state before PBH
formation. Because the χ’s inside a FB couple through φ, which provides an attractive
Yukawa potential. The length of Yukawa interaction increases as FB temperature decreases,
and thus Yukawa energy eventually dominates the total FB energy which causing the FB
collapses into a PBH [22].

Speciﬁcally, the formation of PBHs can be realized by the Lagrangian [28]

L ⊃ ¯χ(i /∂ − Mi)χ − gχφ ¯χχ − Veﬀ (φ, T ) ,

(3.1)

where Mi represents the bare mass of χ in the false vacuum, Veﬀ is the ﬁnite-temperature
quartic eﬀective potential commonly appears from theoretical models [49, 50]

Veﬀ (φ, T ) = D(T 2 − T 2

0 )φ2 − (AT + C)φ3 +

φ4 ,

(3.2)

which induces the cosmological FOPT. The FOPT happened when the temperature be-
comes lower than critical temperature Tc, which is determined by the condition Veﬀ (0, Tc) =
Veﬀ (vφ(Tc), Tc), at this moment, the false vacuum ((cid:104)φ(cid:105) = 0) was tunnelling to the true vac-
uum ((cid:104)φ(cid:105) = vφ). We deﬁne the parameter B to be the zero-temperature potential energy
density diﬀerence between the false and true vacuum [24]. Finally, the quartic potential
can be described by these input parameters [24]

λ, A, B, C, D .

We use the analytical expression for the Euclidean action S3(T )/T of quartic poten-
tials [50] to compute the bubble nucleation rate per unit volume Γ(T ) and then obtain
the fraction of space in the false vacuum F (t) [24]. The phase transition temperature T(cid:63)
identiﬁed as percolation temperature can be obtained when a fraction 1/e of the space
remains in the false vacuum. Such that the corresponding time of phase transition t(cid:63) is
given by F (t(cid:63)) = 1/e (cid:39) 0.37.

In general, GW signals accompany the FOPT from bubble collisions, sound waves, and
Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. [51–55]. In our case, since the bubble wall reaches a
relativistic terminal velocity thus corresponds to a non-runaway bubble, the sound waves
dominates the GW production [51]. We follow the semi-analytical approaches to evaluate
the GW spectra [51, 56]. GW characteristic frequency associates with the inverse time
duration of the FOPT β/H(cid:63) (cid:39) T(cid:63) [d(S3/T )/dT ] [52], which is normalized to Hubble time
scale. In addition to this parameter, the GW spectrum also depends on α, the strength

– 6 –

of FOPT, which is deﬁned as the ratio between false vacuum energy to the total radiation
energy.

To ﬁnd nFB the number density of FB, we need to know the critical volume V(cid:63) which
is deﬁned from a volume in false vacuum satisfying the condition Γ(T(cid:63))V(cid:63)R(cid:63) (cid:39) vw [23], and
thus this volume would not further separate into smaller one during its shrinking. Here R(cid:63)
and vw are the radius of critical volume and the bubble wall velocity, respectively. Under
the assumption that each critical volume corresponds to one FB, the volume fraction of
false vacuum implies the relation nFB|T(cid:63) = F (t(cid:63))/V(cid:63) at t(cid:63).

Inside a FB, to avoid complete annihilation ¯χχ → φφ, there must be a nonzero number
density asymmetry ηDM ≡ (nχ −n ¯χ)/s (normalized to the entropy density). Then we deﬁne
QFB the total number of χ’s comprising a FB: QFB ≡ ηDM(s/nFB)|T(cid:63) [23].

In general, the dark and SM sectors need not to be in thermal equilibrium, otherwise
the dark radiation (φ and χ) would contributes the eﬀective number of extra neutrino
species ∆Neﬀ and exceed the current observational upper bound.
In fact, lowering the
dark sector temperature than SM sector alleviates the tension between ∆Neﬀ and observa-
tions [24]. Thus, we include the temperature ratio rT ≡ T(cid:63)/TSM(cid:63) at t(cid:63) as one of the input
parameter for FOPT.

The dark fermion particles χ’s aggregated to form macroscopic FBs due to the FOPT.
Subsequently, the attractive Yukawa force between χ’s mediated by φ destabilizes the FBs
to form PBHs. In the following section, we quantitatively discuss these processes.

3.1 FB properties and PBH formations

The derivation for the FB mass and radius can be found in Ref. [28]. Including the Fermi gas
kinetic energy, Yukawa potential energy, and the temperature-dependent potential energy
diﬀerence between the false and true vacua; the total energy of a FB is approximately
written as

where V0(T ) ≡ Veﬀ (0, T ) − Veﬀ (vφ(T ), T ), which at zero temperature returns into B. Since

a FB, each χ has mass Mi and couples to others via the attractive Yukawa interaction

Since the FOPT behaves as common origin for both PBHs and GW, it predicts the corre-
lated signals among the 511 keV line, extragalactic photon spectrum, and GW spectrum.
More speciﬁcally, the quartic potential dictates the FOPT and then the Yukawa interac-
tion determines the period of PBHs formation. Therefore, we select and scan the input
parameters: including the coeﬃcients of the eﬀective potential, the asymmetry parameter

Table 1. The benchmark points form PBHs after FOPT with A = 0.1 ﬁxed.

According to the BPs in Table 1, in order to produce the desired PBH mass, one
requires the energy scale O(1) (cid:46) B1/4/MeV (cid:46) O(100) of FOPT. By incorporating ηDM,

we can obtain the correct values of fPBH to generate 511 keV line. Under our scenario,
FB was formed as an intermediate state and treated as a progenitor of PBH. In order to
satisfy the stability condition of FB, i.e Eq.(3.7), all BPs tend to have large values of gχ,
close to the perturbative limit, and nonzero values of Mi are necessary. In addition, the
observational upper bound of ∆Neﬀ ≤ 0.5 was imposed to all the BPs, and thereby restricts
the temperature ratio to be 0.3 ≤ rT ≤ 0.5. Here, we assumed the dark sector and SM
sector are thermally decoupled, such that it suppresses the dark sector contribution to the
light degree of freedom.

The extragalactic photon contributions of these BPs are shown in Fig. 3. BP-4, BP-5
and BP-6 haven’t been rule out by the present observations COMPTEL/EGRET/FermiLAT.
This is because the associated PBH masses from BP-4, BP-5 and BP-6 are heavier com-
paring with BP-1, BP-2, and BP-3. Base on the property of Hawking radiation, the
gamma-ray spectra of them peak at lower energy window between 0.1 MeV to 1 MeV,
where the present observations do not have suﬃcient sensitivities. However, this window
will be explored by future AMEGO and e-ASTROGAM observations. On the other hand,
the GW spectra of BPs, mainly arising from sound waves in the plasma after bubbles col-
lision during the FOPT [51], are shown in Fig. 4. They cover the frequency region from
10−5 Hz to 10−3 Hz, and their amplitudes can be substantially detected by future µAres
telescope.

5 Conclusion

PBH with mass 3 × 10−17 (cid:46) MPBH/m(cid:12) (cid:46) 7 × 10−17 and fractional abundance 0.01 (cid:46)
fPBH (cid:46) 0.5 is favored to explain the galaxy center 511 keV line excess. PBH evapora-
tion emits not only positrons but also photons contributing to the extragalactic gamma-
ray ﬂux. We investigated the novel PBH production mechanism from the cosmological
FOPT aggregating χ’s into FB as intermediate state. Through the attractive Yukawa
interaction, FBs become unstable as temperature decreasing and eventually collapse to
form PBHs. To realise this scenario, we selected the BPs satisfying several conditions:
∆Neﬀ ≤ 0.5, stability of FB in the false vacuum, and upper limits of gamma-ray ﬂux from
EGERT/COMPTEL/FermiLAT. Incorporate the χ asymmetry ηDM (cid:39) 10−10, the phase
transition with vacuum energy O(1) (cid:46) B1/4/MeV (cid:46) O(100) produces the desired PBH
mass and abundance for 511 keV excess. Consequently, correlated signals of extragalac-
tic O(MeV) gamma-ray and GW spectrum with peak frequency from 10−5 Hz to 10−3
Hz are predicted.
In the future, these signals can be either conﬁrmed or ruled out by
AMEGO/e-ASTROGAM and µAres.
