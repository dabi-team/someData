Background: Classical novae are cataclysmic nuclear explosions occurring when a white dwarf in a binary system accretes
hydrogen-rich material from its companion star. Novae are partially responsible for the galactic synthesis of a variety of
nuclides up to the calcium (A
40) region of the nuclear chart. Although the structure and dynamics of novae are thought to
be relatively well understood, the predicted abundances of elements near the nucleosynthesis endpoint, in particular Ar and Ca,
appear to sometimes be in disagreement with astronomical observations of the spectra of nova ejecta.

∼

Purpose: One possible source of the discrepancies between model predictions and astronomical observations is nuclear reac-
tion data. Most reaction rates near the nova endpoint are estimated only from statistical model calculations, which carry large
uncertainties. For certain key reactions, these rate uncertainties translate into large uncertainties in nucleosynthesis predictions.
In particular, the 38K (p,γ) 39Ca reaction has been identiﬁed as having a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on Ar, K, and Ca production. In
order to constrain the rate of this reaction, we have performed a direct measurement of the strengths of three candidate ℓ = 0
resonances within the Gamow window for nova burning, at 386
Method: The experiment was performed in inverse kinematics using a beam of unstable 38K impinged on a windowless
hydrogen gas target. The 39Ca recoils and prompt γ rays from 38K (p,γ) 39Ca reactions were detected in coincidence using a
recoil mass separator and a bismuth-germanate scintillator array, respectively.

18.4 meV, respectively.
Conclusions: We have established a new recommended 38K(p,γ)39Ca rate based on experimental information, which reduces

overall uncertainties near the peak temperatures of nova burning by a factor of
model calculations of the hottest oxygen-neon novae reduces overall uncertainties on Ar, K, and Ca synthesis to factors of 15
or less in all cases.

INTRODUCTION

±

Classical novae are some of the most common explosive
stellar events to occur in our galaxy, with an estimated fre-
11 per year [1]. Novae happen when a white
quency of 35
dwarf in a binary system accretes hydrogen-rich material from
its main-sequence companion, igniting thermonuclear run-
away. Observations of the spectra of ejected material indicate
that two main classes of nova exist, depending on the initial
composition of the underlying white dwarf: carbon-oxygen
(CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe). Model calculations indicate

that ONe novae, which occur on more massive white dwarves,
can reach peak temperatures around 0.4 GK and synthesize
nuclei up to the calcium region (A
40). At present, there
are a number of outstanding discrepancies between astronom-
ical observations of the spectra of nova ejecta [2–5] and nova
model predictions [6, 7]. In particular, the model predictions
of Ref. [7] indicate Ar and Ca abundances at roughly the solar
level, while in contrast the observations of Ref. [3] point to-
wards nova ejecta with Ar and Ca abundances around an order
of magnitude greater than solar. Resolution of such discrepan-
cies requires that nova models be capable of making detailed
predictions regarding the synthesis of nuclides in the Ar–Ca
region. In turn, this requires improved constraints on the rates
of key nuclear reactions involved in nova nucleosynthesisis,
in particular for reactions near the nucleosynthesis endpoint.

In 2002, Iliadis et al. published a seminal paper investigat-
ing the inﬂuence of nuclear reaction rate variations on nucle-
osynthesis in classical novae [8].
In this study, the authors
varied the rates of 64 nuclear reactions within their recom-
mended uncertainties and examined the effect of these vari-
ations on the nucleosynthesis predictions of seven different

 
 
 
 
 
 
nova models. For the hottest model included in the study,
reaching a peak temperature of 0.418 GK, the authors iden-
tiﬁed the 38K(p,γ)39Ca reaction as having a signiﬁcant inﬂu-
ence on the production of Ar, K, and Ca. Qualitatively, the
predicted abundances of these elements were found to vary by
respective factors of 24, 58, and 57 when the 38K(p,γ)39Ca
rate was varied within its existing uncertainties. When Ref.
[8] was published, the 38K(p,γ)39Ca rate was estimated en-
tirely from statistical model predictions with no experimental
nuclear physics input [9]. This rate estimate was assigned an
overall uncertainty of 104, i.e. the upper and lower limits were
established at 100 and 0.01 times the central value, respec-
tively. The importance of this reaction for nova nucleosyn-
thesis, along with the paucity of experimental input regarding
the accepted rate, prompted an attempt by the present authors
to measure the strengths of the three ℓ = 0 resonances lying
within the Gamow window for ONe novae (Tpeak
0.2–0.4
GK). The ﬁrst results of this study were published in a review
article [10] and a recent Letter, which recommends a new,
experimentally-based rate with uncertainties over two orders
of magnitude smaller than before [11]. In the present Article,
we expand upon Ref. [11], providing signiﬁcantly more detail
concerning the experiment and data analysis. We also report
the results of a new sensitivity study investigating the effect of
our measurement on the synthesis of Ar, K, and Ca in classical
novae. The results presented here supersede those published
previously.

II. EXPERIMENT

The experiment was performed in the ISAC-I [12] hall at
TRIUMF, Canada’s national laboratory for particle and nu-
clear physics. A beam of radioactive 38K was produced by
impinging 500 MeV protons from the TRIUMF cyclotron onto
a high-power TiC production target. The 38K(1+) ions pro-
duced by spallation reactions in the target were extracted and
sent through a high-resolution mass separator. They were then
charge bred to the 7+ charge state in an electron cyclotron res-
onance (ECR) charge state booster before post-acceleration.
The charge breeding is necessary because the ISAC-I radio
frequency quadrupole (RFQ) is restricted to a mass-to-charge
ratio of 30 or less [13].

The 38K(7+) beam was delivered to the Detector of Recoils
and Gammas of Nuclear Reactions (DRAGON) where it im-
pinged on a windowless extended gas target [14], ﬁlled with
H2 at an average pressure and temperature of 10.6 mbar and
298 Kelvin, respectively. The H2 was cleaned by continuous
recirculation through a LN2 cooled zeolite trap. The prompt
γ rays from 38K(p,γ)39Ca reactions were detected in array
of 30 bismuth germanate (BGO) scintillators surrounding the
target, while the 39Ca recoils were transmitted to the focal
plane of DRAGON, separating them from unreacted and elas-
tically scattered 38K. A timing signature for recoils was estab-
lished as the time difference between signals from a pair of
microchannel plates (MCPs) separated by 59 cm, which de-
tected secondary electrons produced by the interaction of the
recoil ions with a diamond-like carbon foil intersecting the

2

beam line. The total kinetic energy and stopping power of the
recoil ions was measured in a multi-anode ionization cham-
ber (IC) [15]. Coincidences between recoils and prompt γ
rays were identiﬁed using a timestamp-based algorithm [16].
The 39Ca recoils were separated from a background of scat-
tered and charge-changed 38K (“leaky beam”) based primar-
ily on the local time of ﬂight (TOF) between the two MCPs
(“MCP TOF”) and the time difference between the γ ray and
the upstream MCP (“separator TOF”).

Laboratory beam energies of 15.58 MeV, 20.56 MeV, and

10 keV resonances, respec-

tively. The beam energies were measured using the proce-
dure given in Ref. [17]. The beam was centered on 2 mm
slits downstream of DRAGON’s ﬁrst magnetic dipole, and the
measured ﬁeld value was converted to energy by solving the
relativistically-correct equation,

tion studies. Their recommended excitation energies are

surements at the 15.58 MeV, 20.56 MeV, and 27.17 MeV
beam energies were 5.98 mrad, 5.29 mrad, and 4.73 mrad.
Each of these is well within the

of DRAGON [22].

For each beam energy, only a single charge state was trans-
mitted to the end of DRAGON. The respective charge states
were 7+, 9+, and 10+ for the 15.58 MeV, 20.56 MeV, and
27.17 MeV beam energies. The charge state fractions and
stopping powers for K and Ca ions passing through the gas
target were measured separately using stable beams of 39K
and 44Ca. Charge state fractions were determined by measur-
ing the ratio (Ig
1 ), where I0, I1, and I2 represent
the current on Faraday cups upstream of the gas target, down-
stream of the gas target, and downstream of the ﬁrst magnetic
dipole, respectively; and the superscripts g and ng represent
currents measured with and without gas in the target, respec-
tively. Current measurements were taken with the magnetic
dipole set to accept each of the charge states that resulted in
a measurable I2. The resulting distributions were then ﬁt with
a Gaussian function (normalized to unity). The value of the
Gaussian at each charge state was taken to represent the cor-
responding charge state fraction. Measurements were taken
at three different beam energies spanning the range of beam

energies employed in the experiment, and the resulting charge
fractions were ﬁt with a quadratic function. The value of this
quadratic function at the various beam energies employed in
the experiment was then taken as the charge state fraction to
use in the recoil yield analysis. All ﬁts were performed us-
ing MINUIT and errors on the ﬁt parameters were calculated
using MINOS [23]. The errors on the Gaussian ﬁt were prop-
agated along with the errors on the quadratic interpolation to
arrive at the ﬁnal error on the charge state fractions used in the
analysis.

The number of incoming 38K(7+) ions was determined by
counting delayed (t1/2 = 7.6 minutes) 2.2 MeV γ rays emitted
by the daughters of beam ions implanted into the mass slits
just downstream of DRAGON’s ﬁrst electric dipole. These γ
rays were detected in a NaI scintillator with an efﬁciency of
6. This efﬁciency was determined from a
(8.46
GEANT4 [24] simulation, which included the entire geometry
of the mass slit box and NaI detector. The 11% relative un-
certainty on the NaI efﬁciency was determined by comparing
simulation results to known 22Na and 137Cs source measure-
ments. This analysis includes an uncertainty on the source

N0 is the initial number of particles implanted in the slit, and

and N0 were allowed to vary as free parameters. Cases where
the average beam rate ﬂuctuated signiﬁcantly over the course
of a run were identiﬁed by a noticeable deviation from the
expected response. These ﬂuctuations in the beam rate (or
the complete loss of beam delivery) arose from a number of
sources upstream of the DRAGON target, for example loss
of the 500 MeV proton beam or Faraday cup readings taken
by the ISAC-I operators. In these cases, differing sections of
the run were visually identiﬁed and independently ﬁt to Eq.
(2). Figure 1(a) shows sample ﬁtted rate vs. time curves for
two runs, one with a constant beam rate and the other with
a varying beam rate (and corresponding piecewise ﬁt). Fig-
ure 1(b) shows the average beam rates determined for each

rate was approximately 2

seen, in both cases no recoil events fall within this expected
window. As a result, we extracted upper limits on the reso-
nance strengths using a modiﬁcation of the Rolke proﬁle like-
lihood method for calculating conﬁdence intervals in the pres-
ence of uncertain background rates and detection efﬁciencies
[25].
In the standard Rolke treatment, the likelihood is the
product of the individual likelihoods describing the signal rate
µ, background rate b (both treated as Poisson), and the detec-
tion efﬁciency η (treated as Gaussian with uncertainty ση).

Following the Rolke prescription, we maximize Eq. (4) with
(cid:3)
respect to the “nuisance” parameters
to arrive
at a proﬁle likelihood that is a function of only the resonance
strength ωγ. In practice, we ﬁrst take the negative logarithm
of Eq. (4) and then calculate the minimum numerically us-
ing the MINUIT package [23]. The resulting proﬁle likeli-
hoods for the 15.58 MeV and 20.56 MeV beam energies are
shown in Figures 2(b) and 2(c), respectively (plotted as nega-
tive log-likelihoods). To extract single-sided 68%, 90%, and
95% upper limits from the proﬁle likelihood curves, we fol-
low exactly the prescriptions of Ref. [25]. The resulting upper
limits, along with all of the measured parameters going into
the upper limit calculation are summarized in Tables I and II.
It should be noted that when we refer to “68%” or “95%” con-
ﬁdence intervals, we mean the area under a normalized gaus-
sian distribution between the

more precisely equal to 68.27% and 95.45%, respectively.

signal rate. Equation (3) is then maximized with respect to b
and η to construct a one-dimensional likelihood curve that is
a function of only the signal strength µ and can be analyzed
to extract upper limits.

In the present analysis, we extend the Rolke method to also
account for uncertainties in the resonance energy Er, the num-
ber of incoming beam particles N, and the 38K + H2 stopping
power ε. Each of these quantities factors into the calculation
of the resonance strength, and hence their uncertainties should
be included for a complete treatment of the problem. For each
of these quantities, we treat the uncertainty as Gaussian (with
widths σE , σN, and σε, respectively). The complete likelihood

ergy of 27.17 MeV. This is demonstrated in the separator TOF
vs. MCP TOF distribution shown by the ﬁlled circles in Fig-
ure 3(a). This spectrum exhibits a clear clustering of 27 recoil
events in the region indicated by the open ellipse. The BGO
z-position distribution of the identiﬁed recoil events is clus-
tered downstream of the target center, indicating a resonance
energy less than the central value of 689 keV [17]. Hence to
extract a resonance strength, ωγ, and a resonance energy, Er,
we use a technique similar to that employed in Ref. [26]. For
a ﬁxed beam energy of 27.17 MeV, we generate a simulated
BGO z-position spectrum over the range of resonance energies
contained within the gas target. For the simulations, we use
the standard DRAGON GEANT3 package [27] and convolute
the resulting BGO energies with a realistic hardware thresh-
old. The hardware threshold was determined experimentally
by taking long background runs with the threshold set to the
value employed in the experiment, and to a reduced value of
50 mV. The resulting spectra were normalized, divided into

each other, and ﬁt with a Fermi function to arrive at the func-
tional form used in the analysis. Following the threshold con-
volution, we scale the simulated spectra by the factor

The γ-ray efﬁciency is implicitly included in the generation
of the simulated spectra since the number of counts appearing
in the spectra prior to scaling is determined by the detection
efﬁciency, as modeled in the GEANT3 simulation. This mod-
eling is sensitive to the branching ratios for γ-ray decay from

∼

the 6460 keV state in 39Ca. These branching ratios have not
been measured, and hence we have assumed dominant decays
either directly to the ground state or through the ﬁrst excited
5/2− state, as observed for the decay of known 5/2+ excited
states in the well-studied mirror nucleus 39K [21]. The lo-
cation of the 5/2−1 state in 39Ca has not been conclusively as-
3–4 MeV
signed, but there are a number of candidates in the
excitation energy region [21]. Hence for the present analysis,
we have assumed decay through a state at 3.5 MeV to rep-
resent the feeding through the 5/2−1 . To quantatively account
for the uncertainty related to the γ-ray decay scheme, we have
utilized a proﬁle likelihood technique to marginalize over the
unknown branching ratios. Speciﬁcally, we performed sep-
arate simulations for a range of different fractional feedings
directly to the ground state or through a state at 3.5 MeV. In
the simulations, the ground state/excited state ratios ranged
from 0%–100% in steps of 10%. For each set of simulations,
we took the branching with the highest likelihood value and
incorporated it into the eventual likelihood surface used to ex-
tract conﬁdence intervals on the resonance strength and en-
ergy (the calculation of likelihoods and construction of the
likelihood surface is detailed later in this section). This tech-
nique of using proﬁle likelihoods to marginalize over relevant,
but uninteresting “nuisance” parameters is well established in
the statistical literature; see, for example Refs. [25, 28].
It
should be noted that the uncertainty on the γ-ray detection
efﬁciency is dominated by geometrical and Monte-Carlo un-
certainties and not the unknown branching ratios.

The yield parameter in Eq. (6), Yωγ, is given by the convolu-
tion of the standard Breit-Wigner narrow-resonance cross sec-
tion [29] with the gas target density proﬁle. The density pro-
ﬁle was measured in a previous experiment by recording the
γ-ray yield from the 3He(12C, p)14Nγ reaction in a shielded
BGO detector moved along the length of the target [30]. These
data (scaled to the 27.17 MeV beam energy employed in the
present experiment) are shown in Figure 3(b). The density
proﬁle was determined by ﬁtting the data with the following

sis is shown in Figure 3(c). This ﬁgure shows a contour plot of
the NLL as a function of the resonance energy and resonance
strength, which contains two local minima. The ﬁrst (global)
minimum is in the constant-pressure region of the target with

density has not yet reached equilibrium, at Er = 677 keV,

ωγ = 650 meV, and
ues, we exclude the Er = 677 keV solution at a 76% signiﬁ-
cance level. This signiﬁcance level was calculated using the
likelihood ratio test, wherein 2 ln[L0/L1] (here equal to 1.4)

resonance strength measurement is subject to systematic un-
certainties related to each of the quantities in Table III, while
the resonance energy measurement is affected only by the
stopping power. Adding all of the relative uncertainties in

The uncertainty due to potential background from reac-

was determined through a background measurement using
a stable beam of pure 38Ar, with a total ions on target of
1011. This measurement observed a single count

beam event based on its location in the IC total energy vs. en-
ergy loss spectrum. This is demonstrated in Figure 3(f), which
clearly shows that the suspected background event is well sep-
arated from the locus of 38K recoils and is consistent with the
locus of leaky beam events. Furthermore, the known proper-
ties of 38Ar +p radiative capture imply that background from
38Ar contamination is highly unlikely. There are no known
38Ar +p resonances within 10 keV of the energies covered in
the DRAGON gas target [21]. As a result, resonant capture
is only possible through heretofore unknown proton-unbound
states in the well-studied 39K nucleus. Concerning direct cap-
ture, we calculate an estimated cross section of 0.6 nb using
the S-factor parametrization of Ref. [31]. Integrated across the
length of the entire target, this results in an expected yield of
only 6

5 recoils.

Given the small likelihood that the single event observed
in the measurement with pure 38Ar beam is a genuine
38Ar(p,γ)39K recoil, we do not alter the ωγ = 120 meV cen-
tral value extracted from our likelihood analysis. However,
for a conservative estimate of the associated uncertainties,
we recommend that the lower-bound systematic uncertainty
include the possibility of unforeseen contamination arising
from 38Ar(p,γ)39K reactions. To calculate this uncertainty,
we ﬁrst determine an upper limit of 2.4 events, or a yield
12, in the pure 38Ar beam measurement. We do
of 3.4
this by applying the standard Rolke method [25] to the single
count observed in the recoil region. In the production runs
with the 38K radioactive beam (mixed with 38Ar contamina-
tion), this translates into an upper limit of 13 events. This
upper limit is calculated assuming an Ar/K ratio of 1.54 in
the production beam, determined by sending attenuated beam
to the end of DRAGON and ﬁtting the individual Ar and K
components in the IC energy loss spectrum. Dividing by the
27 observed recoil events, we arrive at a relative uncertainty
of 50%. This uncertainty applies only to the lower limit on
the resonance strength since the presence of background due
to beam contamination can only reduce, never increase, the
measured resonance strength. We emphasize that this proce-
dure for determining a systematic uncertainty due to potential
38Ar background is an ad hoc adjustment, not one formulated
from rigorous statistical methods. Overall, it provides a con-
servative estimate on the total systematic uncertainty applied
to the resonance strength measurement.

The beam delivered to DRAGON was also contaminated
by isomeric 38mK (Ex = 130 keV, t1/2 = 924 ms). The ratio
of 38mK to 38gK was measured to be 7.1
2 at the ISAC
yield station. The yield measurements bypass the charge state
booster, and hence some additional fraction of the isomers will
decay before reaching DRAGON. The delay between produc-
tion and arrival at the DRAGON target is dominated by the
charge breeding time, which has been measured to be on the
order of a few hundred milliseconds [32]. Taking a nominal
delay time of 400 ms, the 38mK/38gK ratio would decrease to
2 by the time the beam reaches the DRAGON target.

Given the small fraction of 38mK in the beam, no background
from isomeric capture is expected.

C. Singles Analysis

7

In addition to the coincidence analysis of the 689 keV res-
onance presented in Section II B, we have also performed a
separate extraction of the resonance strength using heavy-ion
singles data alone. This analysis was guided by the results of
the prior coincidence analysis, i.e. regions of interest in vari-
ous parameter spaces were identiﬁed by the location of coin-
cidence recoils. However, the ﬁnal quantitative cuts applied to
the singles data were determined from the distributions of the
singles parameters alone. This singles analysis made use of
the time difference between the incoming beam bunch (mea-
sured from the ISAC-I RFQ signal) and the upstream MCP to
construct a separator TOF parameter without requiring prompt
γ rays. This analysis is summarized in the plots shown in Fig-
ure 4. Panel (a) shows the standard MCP TOF signal plotted
vs. the RF–MCP TOF, where the 27 events already identiﬁed
as recoils in the coincidence analysis (represented by the blue
ﬁlled circles) are tightly clustered in a narrow region of the
plot. Continuing the analysis, we ﬁrst set a gate on the entire
upper-left region of the plot, which contains all of the coinci-
dence recoils (the actual gate is included in the Figure 4(a) as
the blue dashed line). We then project these events onto the
solid black diagonal axis shown in the ﬁgure.

The new projected parameter (“RF-MCP projection”) is
shown in the panel (b) of Figure 4, plotted vs. two separate
parameters: 1) the y position in the upstream MCP, deduced
from a resistive-anode readout scheme; and 2) the energy loss
in the third (most downstream) anode of the IC. In both cases,
the conﬁrmed recoil events are tightly clustered in a single re-
gion of the plot. To further separate recoil events from back-
ground, we place a one-dimensional cut on the “RF-MCP pro-
jection” parameter, including all events to the left of the black
dotted line in the ﬁgure. For these events only, we then plot the
IC energy loss vs. the MCP y position, shown in Figure 4(c).
Here, the singles events cluster into two distinct loci, with the
conﬁrmed recoil events falling entirely within the upper-right
cluster. From this, we conclude that the singles events in the
upper-right locus correspond to recoils, while the events in the
lower-left locus correspond to background leaky beam events.
To quantify the overlap between the recoil and leaky beam
regions in Figure 4(c), we project onto the diagonal axis in-
dicated by the solid black line in the ﬁgure. This projection
is shown in the Figure 4(d). The measured data (shown as
open circles with error bars) are well-described by a double-
Gaussian distribution (shown as dashed, dot-dashed, and solid
lines, as indicated in the legend). The smaller Gaussian on
the left of the ﬁgure corresponds to the estimated background
distribution, and the larger Gaussian on the right of the ﬁg-
ure corresponds to the recoil distribution. We take the true
number of recoil events to be equal to the integral of the sig-
nal distribution, 52.0
8.2. The uncertainty on this quantity
comes from propagating the 1σ uncertainties on the individ-
ual ﬁt parameters, which were calculated with MINUIT.

±
previous maximum likelihood analysis. The inﬂuence of this
assumption is minor; calculating the resonance strength using
the previous resonance energy of 689

result by less than 1 meV. The resulting resonance strength is

20 meV (statistical uncertainty only), which is in

In practice, the singles technique frequently results in a
lower systematic uncertainty than the coincidence method

since there is no need to estimate the γ-ray detection efﬁ-
ciency. This efﬁciency typically comes with a relative uncer-
tainty of 10% or greater, resulting from uncertainties in the
GEANT3 simulation of the BGO array [27], as well as from
unknown γ-ray decay schemes. However, for reliable appli-
cation of the singles technique, it is crucial that the full width
of the resonance be contained within the gas target, to ensure
that the thick-target approximation of the resonance strength
formula is valid. In the future, technical advances will likely
improve the ability to discern resonance positions based on
only a handful of recoil events. With this capability, an off-
center resonance would be spotted early on during a running
period, and the beam energy could be adjusted accordingly.
One example presently under development is the use of a fast-
timing LaBr array for γ-ray detection. The fast timing proper-
ties of LaBr allow the resonance position to be deduced from
the time difference between the detected γ rays and the arrival
of the corresponding beam bunch. Preliminary calculations
and simulation work suggest that this method is more precise
than the presently-employed z-position technique and may be
5 conﬁrmed recoils [33].

ﬁlled green triangles connected by the dotted line represent results

III. DISCUSSION

As discussed in Ref. [11], the present measurements place
signiﬁcant constraints on the overall 38K(p,γ)39Ca reaction
rate at nova temperatures. This is demonstrated in Figure 5,
which shows the calculated rate vs. temperature curves for the
three presently reported resonances, along with their sum. As-
suming the astrophysical rate is dominated by these three res-
onances, the lower curve (the nominal 689 keV resonance)

sets a lower limit on the astrophysical rate, while the sum sets
an upper limit. For comparison, the recommended rate from
Iliadis et al., along with the factor 100 up/down uncertainty
band, is also included in the ﬁgure. At peak temperatures for
ONe nova burning, T
0.4 GK, the total uncertainty has been
≃
reduced from a factor of 104 to a factor of
40. Applying
these new, experimentally based, limits to the model predic-
tions of the Iliadis et al. sensitivity study [8] results in a reduc-
tion of overall uncertainties on 38Ar, 39K, and 40Ca production

25, 136, and 57 to
in ONe novae from respective factors of
factors of
2, 18, and 9. Note for these calculations, the nu-
cleosynthesis models which maximized the sensitivity to the
38K(p,γ)39Ca rate were used. For 38Ar and 40Ca this corre-
sponds to the “S1” model (Tpeak = 418 MK), while for 39K the
“P2” model (Tpeak = 356 MK) was used.

∼

In order to investigate the dependence of these sensitivity
results to speciﬁc nova models, we have performed a sepa-
rate 38K(p,γ)39Ca sensitivity study based on an independent
calculation performed with the NuGrid package, using the
single-zone “post processing network” (ppn) code [34]. The
initial conditions of the calculation are a 1.3 solar mass white
dwarf with a temperature of 7.0 MK. The white dwarf com-
position is given by the “Denisenkov” model, evolved using
the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)
/yr, and the com-
code [35]. The accretion rate is 10−
position of the accreted material is assumed to be solar. The
peak temperature of the model outburst is 408 MK, similar to
the 418 MK peak temperature of the S1 model from Ref. [8].
A complete description of the parameters going into the Nu-
Grid calculation can be found in Ref. [34]. The results of the
NuGrid sensitivity study are summarized in Table IV, with re-
sults from the Iliadis et al. study included for comparison. The
recommended rate utilized for this analysis is identical to the
one presented in Ref. [9]. Overall, the predictions of the Nu-
Grid and the S1 models are rather consistent, with agreement
to within a factor of two in all cases.

11 M
⊙

Our measurements and sensitivity analyses indicate that the
38K(p,γ)39Ca rate is not a likely source of signiﬁcant over- or
under-production of 38Ar, 39K or 40Ca in novae (relative to
solar abundances). Hence the over-production of Ar and Ca
observed in the spectra of nova ejecta [2–5] remains unex-
plained. We encourage more extensive sensitivity studies and
multi-zone model calculations to investigate the source of this
anomaly.

It should be noted that the present results intrinsically de-
pend on the veracity of previous transfer reaction studies,
which have established the 39Ca level scheme in the Ex = 6–
7 MeV region. If the spins or level energies established from
these studies are incorrect or incomplete, the present exper-
iment may have neglected to cover the most important reso-
nance energy windows for astrophysics. For this reason, we
encourage future high-resolution transfer reaction studies that
are targeted speciﬁcally at measuring the properties of poten-
tial astrophysical proton capture resonances in 39Ca.

Although the present measurements are not directly sensi-
tive to the spins of the measured resonances, we can still infer
properties of the resonances in question based on the mea-
sured strengths. For this, we use the standard formula for the
resonance strength [29],

To summarize, we have performed the ﬁrst ever direct mea-

potential ℓ = 0 resonances within the Gamow Window for
classical novae, whose energies have been determined pre-
viously to be 386

39Ca–γ coincidence signal consisting of 27 events. We per-
formed a two-dimensional likelihood analysis on the posi-
tion distribution of the measured γ-rays to extract a resonance

strength and energy of ωγ = 120+50

dence result. For the lower two resonances, we observed no
events consistent with recoils and used a proﬁle likelihood
technique to extract 90% CL upper limits on the resonance
strengths of 2.54 meV and 18.4 meV for the lower and mid-
dle resonances, respectively. Based on these measurements
we have established new recommended upper and lower limits
for the 38K(p,γ)39Ca reaction rate which reduce uncertainties
0.4) from a factor of 104 to a
at peak nova temperatures (T9
factor
40. Incorporating these new limits into two separate
nova model calculations we ﬁnd that the uncertainties on the
predicted abundances of 38Ar, 39K, and 40Ca are reduced to a
factor of 15 or below in all cases.
