ABSTRACT
From 2018 Oct 12 to 13, three successive solar eruptions (E1–E3) with B-class ﬂares
and poor white light coronal mass ejections (CMEs) occurred from the same active
region NOAA AR 12724. Interestingly, the ﬁrst two eruptions are associated with Type
II radio bursts but the third is not. Using the soft X-ray ﬂux data, radio dynamic
spectra and dual perspective EUV intensity images, we comparatively investigate the
three events. Our results show that their relevant ﬂares are weak (B2.1, B7.9 and B2.3)
and short-lived (13, 9 and 14 minutes). The main eruption directions of E1 and E2
are along ∼45◦ north of their radial directions, while E3 primarily propagated along
the radial direction. In the EUV channels, the early speeds of the ﬁrst two CMEs have
apparent speeds of ∼320 km s−1 and ∼380 km s−1, which could exceed their respective
local Alfv´en speeds of ∼300 km s−1 and ∼350 km s−1. However, the CME in the third
eruption possesses a much lower speed of ∼160 km s−1. These results suggest that the
observed Type II radio bursts in the eruptions E1 and E2 are likely triggered by their
associated CMEs and the direction of eruption and the ambient plasma and magnetic
environments may take an important place in producing Type II radio burst or shock
as well.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar Type II radio bursts were ﬁrst reported by Payne-Scott et al. (1947) and named by Wild
& McCready (1950). Usually, a Type II burst appeared as a slowly drifting, from high to low
frequencies, narrow frequency band patterns in radio dynamic spectra (e.g., Nelson & Melrose 1985).

It is generally believed that type II bursts are excited by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) shocks in
the solar atmosphere (e.g., Nelson & Melrose 1985; Cliver et al. 1999; Vrˇsnak & Cliver 2008; Nindos
et al. 2008, 2011, and references therein).

Since the ﬁrst discovery of Type II bursts, they have been found to be closely related to both ﬂares
(e.g., Wild et al. 1954; Maxwell & Thompson 1962; Dodge 1975) and high-velocity ejections (e.g.,
Dodson et al. 1953; Giovanelli & Roberts 1958; Swarup et al. 1960). The blast wave initiated by
ﬂares and piston-driven mechanism associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have become the
two main competitors of the triggering mechanism of the Type II bursts as reviewed by the papers
(e.g., Cliver et al. 1999; Vrˇsnak & Cliver 2008; Nindos et al. 2011) and also suggested by some recent
studies (e.g., Zheng et al. 2018; Frassati et al. 2019; Eselevich et al. 2019).
In the piston-driven
mechanism, besides CME front, some other triggers, such as soft X-ray jet, erupting coronal loop
and eruptive magnetic ﬂux rope are also proposed to explain the production of shock or Type II
burst (e.g., Klein et al. 1999; Klassen et al. 2003; Dauphin et al. 2006; Su et al. 2015; Eselevich et al.
2017; Grechnev et al. 2018).

In theory, the occurrence of a coronal shock requires the introduction of a sudden disturbance in
the corona, which should travel with a speed faster than the local Alfv´en velocity. Early studies (e.g.,
Gosling et al. 1976) indicate that the velocities of CMEs with type II bursts would exceed 400-550
km s−1. However, Gopalswamy et al. (2001) made a statistical study and found that 50% of limb
CMEs associated Type II bursts during 1995 to 1997 have speeds lower than 500 km s−1 and the
lower cutoﬀ of these CMEs’ speeds may reach ∼ 250 km s−1. So far, detailed case studies about
Type II radio bursts with slow CMEs and weak ﬂares (below C-class) have been very rare.

In this paper, we present a case study about two successive Type II bursts associated with B-class
ﬂares and CMEs with slow speeds below ∼400 km s−1 in the period of solar activity minimum.
Our comparative investigations suggest that these Type II radio bursts are likely triggered by their
associated CMEs and we also discuss the inﬂuence from the ambient coronal magnetic structures on
the eruptions.

2. OBSERVATIONS

From 2018 Oct 12 to 13, three eruptions orderly took place in the active region (AR) NOAA 12724.
AR 12724 is near the solar east limb in the ﬁeld of view (FOV) of the ground-based telescopes (spec-
trographs) or space-based telescopes on geosynchronous satellites, such as the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory SOHO and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012). The Solar
Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO, Kaiser et al. 2008) consists of two space-based observa-
tories – one ahead of Earth in its orbit (ST A), the other trailing behind (ST B, lost communications
since 2014 Oct 1). The ST A orbits the Sun with a radius slightly smaller than 1AU and the sepa-
ration angle between ST A and the Earth was about 105◦ during the three events. The host AR is
located on the disk in the view of ST A.

We use the dynamic spectrum data from the radio spectrograph Observation Radio Frequence
pour l’Etude des Eruptions Solaires (ORFEES) observing between 140 and 1000 MHz, Learmonth
solar radio spectrograph covering a frequency range of 25–180 MHz (LEAR, Kennewell & Steward
2003), and the CALLISTO spectrometer (Benz et al. 2009) at the Greenland Observatory. Intensity
images provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) on SDO and the
EUV Imager (EUVI Wuelser et al. 2004) in the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric
Investigation (SECHHI; Howard et al. 2008) on ST A are also utilized to study the early stages

of the eruptions. The observation from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO;
Brueckner et al. 1995) on-board SOHO with a FOV of 2–6.0 R(cid:12) help us to check the associated
CMEs.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Overview of the Events

The general information of the three successive eruption events (E1–E3) are listed in Table 1. All
the three events originated from the same active region (AR) NOAA 12724 and each of them involved
a ﬁlament eruption, a B-class ﬂare and a slow faint white light (WL) CME. Type II radio bursts
only appeared in E1 and E2. The detailed magnitude and the start, peak, and end time of each
ﬂare are given in the “Flare Class” and “Flare Time” column, respectively. The central locations of
the relevant ﬁlaments (F1–F3) in the FOV of AIA are presented in the “Filament Center” column.
The CMEs’ angular widths (AWs) and their quadratic speeds (obtained by performing second-order
polynomial ﬁttings to the height-time measurements) at the ﬁnal height measurements are placed in
the “CME AW” and “CME Speed” columns, respectively.

3.2. Filaments
The AIA 304 ˚A (left column) and EUVI A 195 ˚A (right column) images in Figure 1 show the
morphologies of the AR 12724, the erupting ﬁlaments (F1–F3) and their corresponding ﬂares (Flare1–
Flare3). In the 304 ˚A images, it can be seen that F1 and F2 almost have a north-south orientation,
while F3 runs from east to west. According to the EUVI A 195 ˚A observations, Flare1 and Flare2
were located in the northwest of AR 12724, while Flare3 mainly lay in the AR’s southeast. To the
east of AR 12724, a small emerging active region labelled “New” appeared to have nothing to do
with the eruptions.

3.3. Flares and Radio Bursts

The GOES X-ray ﬂuxes and radio dynamic spectrums associated with E1, E2 and E3 are shown in
the panels (a) and (b) of Figures 2-4, respectively. Figure 2(a) displays the short-lived B2.1 Flare1.
In Figure 2(b), a type II radio burst can be found in the Learmonth’s radio dynamic spectrum,
suggesting that a shock (Shock1) was generated during E1. The type II radio burst, including a
fundamental band (F) and a harmonic band (H) with two splitting lanes (HL and HU ), started
from ∼01:52 UT, when Flare1 has entered its descending phase. After ∼02:00 UT, it gradually
disappeared. The frequencies along F, HL and HU change from about 40, 78, and 80 MHz to 26, 54,
and 64 MHz, respectively. Their average frequency drift rates are -0.086 MHz s−1, -0.087 MHz s−1

and -0.109 MHz s−1. We adopt the frequency values represented by the black (F), red (HL) and blue
(HU ) dashed curves to measure local plasma densities and further derive the speeds of Shock1 (see
Section 3.6).

It is generally believed that the band-splitting is caused by the emission from the upstream and
downstream shock regions and the downstream/upstream density jump (X) could provide an estimate
of the coronal Alfv´en speed (e.g, Smerd et al. 1974; Mann et al. 1995; Vrˇsnak 2001). The density
jump can be described as

X =

n2
n1

= (

f U
f L

)2

(1)

(Vrˇsnak et al. 2002). Here, n1 and n2 are the electron densities of the plasma at the frequency fL in
the lower frequency branch and at the frequency fU in the upper frequency branch of the harmonic
bands, respectively. For the Type II radio burst in E1, we take f U = 77.5 and f L = 64.5 at 01:54:32
UT (indicated by the vertical line in Figure 2(b)) and obtain X = 1.44, indicating that Shock1 is
a weak shock. Under the quasi-perpendicular shock approximation and a plasma beta β− > 0, the
Alfv´en Mach number MA is related to the compression X as

(cid:115)

MA =

X(X + 5)
2(4 − X)

(2)

Then, MA around 1.35 can be derived for Shock1.

The GOES X-ray ﬂux of the B7.1-class ﬂare (Flare2) and the composite dynamic spectrum from
ORFEES (144∼400 MHz) and Greenland (25∼105 MHz) associated with E2 are displayed in the top
and bottom panels of Figure 3, respectively. A variety of radio bursts, such as a group of type III
bursts (IIIs), a relatively strong short-lived type IV burst and a weak type II burst, can be found in
the composite dynamic spectrum. The Type III bursts occurred in the initial and impulsive phase of
Flare2. Some of them show negative frequency drifts which probably result from energetic electron
beams propagating outward along open coronal magnetic ﬁeld (e.g., Yan et al. 2006; Huang et al.
2011), while others show positive drifts which may be caused by energetic electron beams propagating
downward from where they are accelerated (likely the reconnection region) (e.g., Reid & Ratcliﬀe
2014; Ning 2016; Tan et al. 2016). The type IV burst appeared after the peak of Flare2 and lasted
for about 2 minutes. It is probably excited by the energetic electrons trapped within the erupting
magnetic structures (e.g., Smerd & Dulk 1971; Vlahos et al. 1982; Stewart 1985).

At around 14:15 UT on Oct 12, the type II burst appeared with obvious fundamental (F) and second
harmonic bands (splitting into two lanes HL and HU ) in the observation of Greenland. Similar to E1,
it likely indicates a shock (Shock2) induced during the eruption E2. Along HL, the frequency varies
from 90 MHz to 74 MHz with a mean frequency drift of -0.099 MHz s−1 and that decreases from 98
MHz to 83 MHz with a mean frequency drift of -0.113 MHz s−1 along HU . In addition, a very faint
third harmonic band (3H) seems to appear in the dynamic spectrum of ORFEES. Using the same
method described above (see Equation (1)), we obtained the density jump of Shock2 at 14:15:54 UT
(marked by the vertical line in Figure 3(b), when the HU is 98 MHz and HL is 86 MHz), which is
about 1.30. The corresponding shock Mach number was deduced as 1.23.

Figure 4 shows the GOES X-ray ﬂux of the ﬂare (top panel) and the dynamic spectra (bottom
panel) during E3. A B2.3-class ﬂare (Flare3) correlated with E3. Taking advantage of the joint
observations from ORFEES and Greenland, we found that only a very weak type III burst and no
sign of type II burst appeared in this event.

splitting branches. The three curves along the fundamental (black), lower (red) and higher (blue) harmonic
splitting bands are used to measure the frequency drifts and the height and speed of Shock1. The vertical

applied to calculate the density compression of Shock1.

3.4. White Light CMEs
The running diﬀerence intensity images of LASCO C2 and AIA at 193 ˚A are composited and shown
in Figure 5, displaying the coronal changes during E1, E2, and E3. Three faint stream-like CMEs
(CME1–CME3) can be separately identiﬁed in the three eruptions. They are indicated by the arrows
in the left, middle and right column of Figure 5, respectively. According to the LASCO CME catalog
(see https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME list/index.html), CME1–CME3 only appear in the FOV of C2
(2∼6R(cid:12)) and belong to poor events (quality index 1). They separately have an angular width of
about 46◦, 44◦, and 38◦, and a 2nd-order speed at the time of ﬁnal height measurement of 333 km
s−1, 492 km s−1, and 133 km s−1(see Table 1). The times of their ﬁrst appearance in the LASCO
C2’s FOV are around 02:48 UT (Oct 12), 15:12 UT (Oct 12), and 14:36 UT (Oct 13), respectively.

burst and derive the height and speed of the associated shock (Shock2). The vertical dashed line indicate
the time at 14:15:54 UT. The two pink asterisks mark the frequencies which are used to calculate the density
compressions of Shock2.

Obviously, the Type II bursts in E1 and E2 had already formed before their corresponding CMEs
came into the C2 FOV. No relevant CME can be found from the observations of COR 1 (inner
coronagraph) and COR 2 (outer coronagraph) on-board ST A. This may be related to the on-disk
perspective of ST A and the weak magnitudes of the eruptions.

3.5. Eruptions in EUV
The AIA 193 ˚A (Figure 6) and EUVI 195 ˚A (Figure 7) intensity images display the early evolutions
of E1–E3 from diﬀerent perspectives. The original images in the left columns of Figures 6,7 are
utilized as references to get the base diﬀerence images in the middle and right columns. The AIA
193 ˚A data clearly exhibit the dome-like structures of CME1 and CME2 with distinct leading edges
(LE1 and LE2) in their early stages, while CME3 had a tenuous leading edge (LE3). Comparing

the main eruption directions of E1–E3 (indicated by the yellow arrows in Figure 6) with the radial
directions (denoted by the purple arrows in Figure 6), it can be found that CME1 and CME2 primarily
propagated northeast, whereas CME3 was ejected approximately along the radial direction.

In the EUVI observations, three diﬀusing EUV waves (W1–W3) can be observed, as indicated by
the orange arrows in Figure 7. EUV waves are also called “EIT waves” or global coronal waves,
which are large-amplitude waves initially driven by the rapid lateral expansion of a CME in the low
corona and later propagating freely (cf. Long et al. 2017). Ma et al. (2009) showed the evidence that
EUV wave front includes contribution from its associated CME at the early stage. More information
about the “EUV waves” could be seen in the recent reviews (Liu & Ofman 2014; Warmuth 2015;
Chen 2016; Long et al. 2017). The propagation directions of W1 and W2 are similar and mainly
towards the north from their eruption centers, while the traveling of W3 has no obvious preference.
Combining the AIA and EUVI observations with a separation angle of 105 ◦, we estimate that the
eruption directions of E1 and E2 are alike along the ∼45◦ north of their radial directions and E3
basically erupted radially.

Interestingly, a special brightening area (“SBA”, Figures 6b2, 7b2) was observed at the north border
of AR 12724 when the north ﬂank of CME2 swept there (from ∼14:09 UT to ∼14:11 UT on Oct 12).
It showed as an arc structure in the AIA images and a brow-like brightening in the EUVI images.
The SBA may be caused by the interaction of CME or EUV waves with some coronal structures.

right column (c1-c3) for CME3.

Later, another expanding dome-like structure and a propagating diﬀusing wave front can be detected
to propagate forward through SBA in the AIA and EUVI intensity images, which are indicated by
the blue arrows with “2ND” in Figures 6b3,b4, 7b3, respectively. It is probably a secondary wave.

3.6. Kinetics of the CMEs and Shocks

In order to explore the relationship between the CMEs and their associated Type II radio bursts,
we studied the kinetics of CME1–CME3 and Shock1–Shock2, which are presented in Figure 8. For
convenience, the identical colors represent the same bands or slits in Figures 2, 3, 6, 8. Because there
is no associated radioheliograph observation to be available, the exact locations of Type II burst
sources are hard to be determined. Assuming that the electron density of the corona varies with
heliocentric distance and the shock propagates along the radial direction, we ﬁrst deduced the local
plasma densities (n) of Shock1 and Shock2 from the observed frequency (fp indicated by the black
dashed line in Figure 2 or 2fp indicated by the red and blue dashed lines in Figures 2 and 3) in the
light of their relationship
fp = 8.98 × 103√
The results are shown in Figures 8a2, a3. In order to further calculate the heights of Shock1 and
Shock2 from the derived local plasma densities n, we apply the coronal plasma density model of

where y is the height above the solar surface in solar radii and n0 is the electron number density at
the solar surface. We choose n0 as 6.0×108 cm−3 considering the events under this study occurring
in the period of solar activity minimum, which is similar to the value used in Ma et al. (2011). The
time distance proﬁles of Shock1 and Shock2 calculated from the diﬀerent splitting bands in the radio
dynamic spectra are presented in Figures 8c1, c2, respectively. It can be seen that the heights of
Shock1 and Shock2 approximately change from 1.45 R(cid:12) to 1.60 R(cid:12) and from 1.37 R(cid:12) to 1.46 R(cid:12),
respectively.

The leading edges (LE1–LE3) of CME1–CME3 can be tracked in the AIA running diﬀerence images
at 193 ˚A. For each event, we chose three diﬀerent slits (s1a–s1c, s2a–s2c, and s3a–s3c in Figure 6) to
make the time-distance slit images, which display the propagations of the leading edges along diﬀerent
directions. As examples, three time-distance diagrams from s1b, s2b and s3b are plotted in the panels
(b1–b3) of Figure 8. According to the tracks or stripes in the slit images, we calculated the heights
of LE1–LE3 and derived their speeds, which are shown by the diamonds in Figures 8c1–c3,d1–d3,
respectively.

From Figure 8c1, it can be seen that although LE1 had moved out of the AIA’s FOV when Shock1
began to appear, the development trend of the LE1’s heights and the height variation of Shock1

Two Type II Radio Bursts

suggest a high degree correlation between them. Figure 8c2 indicates a similar situation for LE2 and
Shock2. Thus, it is likely that the two shocks corresponding to the two Type II radio bursts in E1
and E2 were separately triggered by the expanding of the leading edges of CME1 and CME2. In
Figures 8d1,d2, it can be found that LE1 and LE2 have various speeds along diﬀerent propagation
directions. LE1 has the largest velocity of ∼320 km s−1 (azure diamonds in Figure 8d1) along s1a
(azure line in Figure 6a4). The fastest speed of LE2 is ∼380 km s−1 (red diamonds in Figure 8d2),
which was calculated along the slit s2c (red line in Figure 6b4).

The speeds of Shock1 and Shock2 derived from their heights are given in Figures 8d1,d2, respec-
tively. It can be found that the shocks’ speeds calculated along the diﬀerent Type II bursts bands
are also diﬀerent. These diﬀerent speeds represent the speeds of the downstream (blue pluses) and
upstream (red and black pluses) shock regions, which might be distinct from each other. In addition,
the discrepancies of the speeds are also probably caused by the measurement errors. On average,
Shock1 has an initial speed of ∼400 km s−1 and that of Shock2 is ∼430 km s−1. According to the
relationship between the shock’s speed (Vs) and the local Alfv´en speed VA, i.e.,

MA =

Vs
VA

(5)

the Alfv´en speeds at the early phases of Shock1 (01:54:32 UT, indicated by the vertical line in
Figures 2b, 8d1) and Shock2 (14:15:54 UT, indicated by the vertical line in Figures 3b, 8d2) can be
deduced as ∼300 km s−1 and ∼350 km s−1, respectively. Compared with the fastest speeds of LE1
(∼320 km s−1) and LE2 (∼380 km s−1), the local Alfv´en speeds are smaller. These results are in
agreement with the scenario of piston-driven shock, supporting our conjecture that the CMEs in E1
and E2 excited their relevant shocks and Type II radio bursts. Figure 8d3 shows that the leading
edge of CME3 had a relatively slower speed (∼160 km s−1) than LE1 and LE2. It is likely less than
the local Alfv´en speed, which might be the reason why Type II radio burst or shock is absent in E3.

3.7. Background Fields from PFSS Extrapolation

To probe the background ﬁeld structures surrounding the eruption source area and their relationship
with the eruptions, an extrapolation was performed using the potential ﬁeld source surface (PFSS)
model (e.g., Schatten et al. 1969; Schrijver & De Rosa 2003) with a starting radius of 1.01 R(cid:12). For
better reliability, one HMI longitudinal magnetogram on 2018 Oct 13 was applied to extrapolate the
potential ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld lines from the extrapolation are overlaid on the AIA 171 ˚A, EUVI
195 ˚A intensity images, HMI and rotated HMI magnetograms, as displayed by Figures 9a–d.

The HMI magnetogram in Figures 9d shows that AR 12724 mainly consists of the leading positive
ﬂux “P” and following negative ﬂux “N”, with some surrounding parasitic magnetic elements, such
as the ﬂuxes “n” and “p”. In this panel, we also overlaid the proﬁles of the three ﬁlaments F1–F3,
which are indicated by the red curves. It can be seen that F1 and F2 are located at the northwest
of the AR and aligned along the magnetic neutral lines between N and p, while F3 lies in the AR’s
southeast region between the opposite polarity ﬂuxes P and n. The spine directions of F1 and F2
are approximately from north to south, opposite to the east-west orientation of F3.

At the remote region to the north of AR 12724, we found some diﬀerent magnetic loop systems,
which are represented by the short dark blue ﬁeld lines. Between these magnetic systems and the
magnetic loops inside AR 12724, the magnetic quasi-separatrix layer (indicated by the yellow dashed

14

Ma & Chen

line) may exist. That area is consistent with the place where the special brightening region SBA in
E2 appeared. It is likely that SBA was caused by the interaction between the north ﬂank of CME2
and the magnetic separatrix layer.

Figure 9. The extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld lines using the PFSS model are overlaid on the AIA, EUVI
intensity images and HMI magnetograms. The yellow dashed curves in the panels (b) and (d) indicate the
location of the “SBA”. “P” and “N” mark the leading and following magnetic ﬂuxes of AR 12724. “p” and
“n” denote the positive and negative parasitic magnetic elements surrounding N and P, respectively. The
thick arrows point to the main eruption directions of F1–F3.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Using radio dynamic spectra and dual perspective EUV observations, We investigate three succes-
sive solar eruptions (E1, E2 and E3) from the same active region AR 12724. All the eruptions were
accompanied by a B-class ﬂare and a slow faint WL CME. However, only the ﬁrst two of them were
observed to correlate with Type II radio bursts, suggesting the likely appearances of shocks (Shock1
and Shock2) only in the two events. From the radio dynamic spectra, we utilize the splitting bands
of the Type II bursts to estimate the density jumps (1.44 and 1.30), Alfv´en Mach numbers (1.35 and
1.23), and coronal Alfv´en speeds (∼300 km s−1 and ∼350 km s−1) of Shock1 and Shock2. Through
a comparative study, we found that

• The apparent speeds of the CMEs’ leading edges (LE1–LE3) are diﬀerent. LE3 has an obvious
slower speed (∼160 km s−1) than LE1 (∼320 km s−1) and LE2 (∼380 km s−1). The speeds of
LE1 and LE2 can exceed their corresponding local Alfv´en speeds (∼300 km s−1 and ∼350 km
s−1).

• E1 and E2 originated from the northwest of AR 12724, while E3 took place from the AR’s

southeast region.

• The EUV imaging observations from two diﬀerent perspective indicate that E1 and E2 erupted
along the ∼45◦ north of their radial directions, while CME3 in E3 approximately propagated
radially.

4.1. Trigger of Type II Radio Bursts

According to the GOES soft X-ray ﬂux data, Flare3 is a B2.3-class ﬂare and stronger than the
B2.1 Flare1. However, Type II radio burst is associated with the weaker one. This is in agreement
with the ﬁnding that the magnitudes of ﬂares are not directly related to the occurrence of Type II
radio bursts (e.g., Cliver et al. 1999). In addition, since all the eruptions took place from the same
AR and all the associated ﬂares are relatively weak (only B-class), it is hard to conclude that the
Type II bursts studied here were initiated by the blast wave due to ﬂares. Our calculations have
shown that the speeds of LE1 and LE2 along certain directions can exceed the local coronal Alfv´en
speeds, which meet the requirements of the formation of a piston-driven shock. Thus, It would be
more reasonable that the Type II bursts were triggered by their associated CMEs. On the other, it
should be noted that the third eruption E3 has a diﬀerent source region and eruption direction from
E1 and E2. The coronal plasma and magnetic ﬁeld environments that the erupting structures of E3
encountered would be also distinct from those of E1 and E2. The missing of Type II burst in E3
may be associated with this situation as well.

4.2. SBA and the Secondary Wave

In the eruption E2, a special brightening area SBA is detected where a magnetic separatrix may
exist according to the results of the PFSS extrapolation (Figure 9). The occurrence or appearance
of SBA in this event might be explained by this scenario: when the ﬂank of CME2 and/or EUV
wave W2 arrived the magnetic separatrix layer, it would be likely compressed and heated, which
might give birth to SBA. Along with the occurrence of the reﬂection and refraction of the EUV
wave near the magnetic separatrix, a secondary wave 2ND might be further produced and propagate

16

Ma & Chen

outward. Similar situations can be found in some other studies (e.g., Ofman & Thompson 2002; Shen
& Liu 2012; Chandra et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2018). In addition, some studies have shown a close
relationship between Type II radio bursts and such interactions (e.g., Kong et al. 2012; Feng et al.
2012; Shen et al. 2019). Using simultaneous radio and EUV imaging data, Chen et al. (2014) found
that the source location of a solar type II radio burst coincides with the interface between CME EUV
wave front and a nearby coronal ray structure, where an obvious EUV brightening also appeared.
They conjectured that the CMEstreamer interactions may be important to the formation of type II
radio burst. Unfortunately, there is no radioheliograph observation available for our study and we
can not conﬁrm the exact location of the type II burst in E2, but according to the results of Chen
et al. (2014), it can be suspected that the special brightening area SBA corresponds to the source
region of the type II burst in E2.
