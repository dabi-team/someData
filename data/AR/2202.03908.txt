The shear viscosity and thermal conductivity coeﬃcients of various liquids exhibit minima along
certain trajectories on the phase diagram. These minima arise due to the crossover between the
momentum and energy transport mechanisms in gas-like and liquid-like regimes. We demonstrate
that the magnitudes of the minima are quasi-universal in appropriately reduced units, especially
for the viscosity coeﬃcients. Results presented in support of this observation concern the transport
properties of three simple model systems with diﬀerent pairwise interaction potentials (hard spheres,
Lennard-Jones, and Coulomb) as well as seven important real atomic and molecular liquids (Ne,
Ar, Kr, Xe, CH4, CO2, and N2). The minima in viscosity and thermal conductivity represent useful
reference points for ﬂuid transport properties.

INTRODUCTION

II. NORMALIZATION

It is well recognized that the viscosity and thermal con-
ductivity of liquids are both strongly system dependent,
can vary across many orders of magnitude, and cannot
be evaluated from ﬁrst-principles theories [1]. Recently,
it has been suggested that the kinematic viscosity and
thermal diﬀusivity of liquids and supercritical ﬂuids have
lower bounds determined by fundamental physical con-
stants [1, 2],

νmin = αmin =

where ν is the kinematic viscosity, α is the thermal diﬀu-
sivity, (cid:126) is the Planck’s constant, me is the electron mass
and m is the atom or molecule mass. The very existence
of universal bounds and their closeness is a notable result,
since our understanding of transport properties in ﬂuids
remains too far from complete as compared to situations
with gases and solids, although some deﬁnite progress
has been achieved over the years [3–7].

The purpose of this paper is to concentrate on purely
classical arguments, which suggest that properly reduced
viscosity and thermal conductivity coeﬃcients can be ex-
pected to reach quasi-universal values at their respec-
tive minima. Minima appear because of the crossover
between the gas-like and liquid-like mechanisms of mo-
mentum and energy transfer. Their magnitudes can
be estimated by extrapolating the gas-like and liquid-
like asymptotes for the transport coeﬃcients into the
crossover regime. This procedure is supported by evi-
dence from several model and real atomic and molecular
systems. The observed quasi-universality is particularly
striking for the viscosity coeﬃcient. We deal exclusively
with classical ﬂuids. Fluids with considerable electron
contribution to the thermal conductivity (e.g. liquid met-
als or multicomponent plasmas) are not considered in this
study.

Variations of the viscosity and thermal conductivity
coeﬃcients with temperature of noble, molecular, and
network liquids along several selected isobars are shown
in Fig. 1 of Ref. [1] and Fig. 1 of Ref. [2]. Minima
are clearly observed. However, the numerical values of
transport coeﬃcients for diﬀerent substances and diﬀer-
ent conditions can diﬀer by orders of magnitude. To har-
monize the picture, it makes sense to use a rational nor-
malization. A particularly useful approach is to employ
a system-independent normalization extensively used by
Rosenfeld [8, 9] (and therefore often referred to as Rosen-
feld’s normalization),

or molecular density, vT = (cid:112)kBT /m is the thermal ve-
locity, T is temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann con-
stant.

III. THEORETICAL MINIMA OF VISCOSITY
AND THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY

The origin of the minima in the reduced viscosity and
thermal conductivity coeﬃcients is the crossover between
diﬀerent mechanisms of the momentum and energy trans-
fer.

In dilute gases the transport properties are determined
by collisions between the constituent atoms. Atoms move
along straight trajectories between collisions. The prop-
erties of collisions are governed by the mechanism of the
interaction between the atoms. In this way the transport
coeﬃcients can be evaluated using the Chapman-Enskog
theory [10], where they are expressed via the transport in-
tegrals (momentum and energy transfer cross sections in-
tegrated with the Maxwellian velocity distribution func-
tion). Elementary kinetic formulas for the viscosity and

thermal conductivity coeﬃcients of dilute gases are [11]

η ∼ mvTn(cid:96),

λ ∼ (cp/kB)vTn(cid:96),

(3)

where (cid:96) is the mean free path between collisions and cp
is the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure (numerical coef-
ﬁcients of order unity are omitted). The mean free path
can be expressed via the eﬀective momentum transfer
cross section Σ as (cid:96) ∼ 1/nΣ (here we use Σ instead of
conventional σ to avoid confusion with the hard-sphere
diameter and Lennard-Jones length scale that will be em-
ployed later). Moreover, for monatomic dilute gases the
exact relation between the viscosity and thermal conduc-
tivity exists, η = 4mλ/15, which does not depend on
exact mechanisms of interatomic interactions [11].

In the opposite regime of dense ﬂuids no ﬁrst prin-
ciple theoretical formulas are available. However, some
approximate relationships do exist. A useful scaling re-
lationship for transport coeﬃcients of ﬂuids is excess en-
tropy scaling proposed by Rosenfeld [8]. According to
this scaling the reduced viscosity and thermal conductiv-
ity coeﬃcients of simple ﬂuids can be expressed as expo-
nential functions of the reduced excess entropy [9]

ηR (cid:39) 0.2e−0.8(sex/kB),

λR (cid:39) 1.5e−0.5(sex/kB).

(4)

Here the reduced excess entropy is sex = s−sid, where s is
the entropy per particle and sid is the entropy (per parti-
cle) of an ideal gas at the same temperature and density.
Note that the excess entropy sex is negative because in-
teractions enhance the structural order compared to that
in an ideal gas. This implies that the reduced viscosity
and thermal conductivity coeﬃcients increase when ap-
proaching to the freezing point. Excess entropy scaling
in the form of Eq. (4) also suggests that the coeﬃcients
ηR and λR can be interrelated. This possibility has been
recently examined in Ref. [12].

Rosenfeld’s excess entropy scaling is a useful heuristic
approach for many simple (and sometimes not so simple)
systems, but counterexamples where it does not apply
also exist [13–15]. For a recent review of this topic see
e.g. Ref. [16].

According to a vibrational model of thermal conduc-
tivity in dense ﬂuids [17–20] the thermal conductivity
coeﬃcient can be estimated from

λ ∼ (cp/kB)νEn1/3,

(5)

where νE is the characteristic frequency of atomic vi-
brations (e.g. Einstein frequency). Dense ﬂuids close
to the freezing point can be considered as essentially in-
compressible. In this cases the diﬀerence between cp and
cv is insigniﬁcant and it is more practical to use cv for
approximate estimates [17, 20].

Let us now use these approximations to estimate the
magnitudes of ηR and λR at their respective minima.
Some of the ideas can be traced back to Ref. [2]. As
already pointed out, the minima of ηR and λR corre-
spond to the crossover between the gas-like and liquid-
like mechanisms of the momentum and energy trans-
fer. First, let us take the gaseous asymptotes (3) and

2

extrapolate them to the point where gaseous approach
breaks down. At the micro scale, gas properties are
mostly determined by pairwise collisions between atoms
or molecules whereas liquid properties are mainly con-
trolled by collective eﬀects. A natural transition con-
dition between these two regimes can be deﬁned as the
point where the eﬀective momentum transfer cross sec-
tion becomes comparable to the interatomic separation
squared, Σ ∼ n−2/3. This condition was in fact liter-
ally employed to discriminate between the “ideal” (gas-
like) and “nonideal” (ﬂuid-like) regions on the phase di-
agram of complex plasmas (using a screened Coulomb
potential model) [21].
Substituting this condition in
Eqs. (3) we readily obtain estimates ηR ∼ 1 and λR ∼
(cp/kB) at their minima. Furthemore, the speciﬁc heat
at the crossover may be approximated as cv/kB ∼ 2 for
monatomic ﬂuids [2, 22–24] (this argument does not ap-
ply to hard sphere ﬂuids, where cv/kB ≡ 3/2). By either
neglecting the diﬀerence between cv and cp or applying
the ideal gas relation cp = cv + kB we arrive at the con-
dition λR ∼ 2 − 3 at the minimum. For molecular liquids
the actual values of cv and cp should be higher due to
the presence of additional degrees of freedom. As a re-
sult the numerical values of λR at the minima should
also be larger. Some representative values for molecular
liquids will be provided below.

Alternatively, we can extrapolate the excess entropy
scaling of ηR and λR in the dense ﬂuid regime towards
the crossover point. The crossover corresponds roughly
to sex/kB (cid:39) −1 [25]. For instance, for hard sphere,
Lennard-Jones, and inverse-power-law ﬂuids, the minima
in reduced shear viscosity occur at an excess entropy ap-
proximately equal to −2kB/3 [26]; Minima of the kine-
matic viscosity and crossing of kinetic and potential con-
tributions to viscosity occur at sex/kB (cid:39) −0.9 [27]. Sub-
stituting sex/kB = −1 in Eqs. (4) we obtain ηR (cid:39) 0.4 and
λR (cid:39) 2.5. This is not too inconsistent with the estimates
based on extrapolating the gaseous asymptotes.

Consider now the vibrational model of heat conduc-
tion in dense liquids, Eq. (5). The crossover between
the gas-like and liquid-like regimes of energy transfer
implies (cid:96) (cid:39) 1/nΣ (cid:39) n−1/3, as discussed previously.
On the other hand, the oscillation frequency should be-
come comparable with collisional frequency at this point,
νE ∼ vT/(cid:96) ∼ vTnΣ ∼ vTn1/3. This implies that the es-
timates based on gaseous and liquid-like asymptotes co-
incide at the crossover and predict λ ∼ (cp/kB)vTn2/3.
In reduced units this amounts to λR ∼ cp/kB, as already
obtained.

In addition, the vibrational model allows for a simple
estimate of the thermal conductivity coeﬃcient at the
onset of ﬂuid-solid phase transition. According to the
celebrated Lindemann’s melting criterion [28], melting of
a three-dimensional (3D) solid occurs when the atomic
vibrational amplitude reaches a threshold value, roughly
∼ 0.1 of the mean interatomic separation (Lindemann’s
criterion is a useful empirical rule, which works relatively
well for simple systems, but may fail for more complex

interatomic interactions). From the energy equipartition
we get in the simplest approximation (see e.g. [29])

where δ is the vibrational amplitude, Tm is the melting
temperature. We then assume that νE does not vary
much upon the phase change and that δ ∼ 0.1n−1/3.
This provides an estimate for the Einstein frequency,

At the freezing point we can estimate speciﬁc heats of
monatomic ﬂuids as cp ∼ cv ∼ 3kB [30]. Substituting
all this back into Eq. (5) we obtain that the reduced
thermal conductivity coeﬃcient of atomic ﬂuids at the
melting temperature can be estimated as

(7)

.

λR ∼ 2.8 (cv/kB) (cid:39) 8.4.

(8)

Note that the excess entropy scaling of transport coeﬃ-
cients, Eq. (4), predicts ηR ∼ 4.9 and λR ∼ 11.1 if we
assume sex/kB ∼ −4 at freezing of simple soft ﬂuids [31].
Thus, from the theoretical perspective we should ex-
pect the minima of reduced viscosity and thermal con-
ductivity coeﬃcients at the level of ηR ∼ 1 and λR ∼ 3
(for monatomic ﬂuids). Additionally, the reduced trans-
port coeﬃcients should increase up to ηR ∼ 5 and
λR ∼ 10 at the freezing point. We will verify the ac-
curacy of this simple picture below.

IV. MODEL SYSTEMS

The three model systems considered here include hard
spheres, Lennard-Jones supercritical ﬂuid and Coulomb
(one-component plasma) ﬂuid. The pairwise interaction
potentials are quite diﬀerent in these systems.

The hard sphere (HS) repulsive interaction potential
is extremely hard and short ranged. The interaction en-
ergy is inﬁnite for r < σ and is zero otherwise, where σ
is the sphere diameter. The main parameter that deter-
mines the HS structural and dynamical properties is the
reduced density ρ∗ = ρσ3.

The Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential is

(9)

where (cid:15) and σ are the energy and length scales (or LJ
units), respectively. The reduced density and temper-
ature expressed in LJ units are ρ∗ = ρσ3, T∗ = kBT /(cid:15).
The LJ system is one of the most popular and extensively
studied model systems in condensed matter, because it
combines relative simplicity with adequate approxima-
tion of interatomic interactions in real substances (such
as liquiﬁed and solidiﬁed noble gases). A very compre-
hensive collection of data regarding the transport prop-
erties of the Lennard-Jones ﬂuid can be founf in Ref. [38].

3

The classical one-component plasma (OCP) model is
an idealized system of point charges immersed in a neu-
tralizing uniform background of opposite charge (e.g.
ions in the immobile background of electrons or vice
versa) [39–43]. This model is of considerable practical
interest in both plasma-related and condensed matter
context. The system is characterized by a very soft and
long-ranged Coulomb interaction potential,

φ(r) = e2/r,

(10)

where e is the electric charge. System properties are
governed by a single dimensionless coupling parameter
Γ = (e2/akBT ), where a = (4πn/3)−1/3 is the Wigner-
Seitz radius. At Γ (cid:38) 1, the OCP exhibits properties char-
acteristic of a ﬂuid-like phase and freezes at Γ (cid:39) 174 [42–
44]. Transport properties of strongly coupled OCP ﬂu-
ids within the vibrational model paradigm have been re-
cently discussed [17, 45].

We summarize the available numerical data for the vis-
cosity and thermal conductivity coeﬃcients of the con-
sidered model systems in Fig. 1. The transport data for
the HS system are taken from recent MD simulations re-
ported in Refs. [32, 33]. For the LJ system we take the
viscosity and thermal conductivity coeﬃcients tabulated
in Refs. [34, 35] for an isotherm T∗ = 2 . Since the re-
duced transport coeﬃcients of LJ liquids along isotherms
exhibit a quasi-universal freezing-density scaling [46], the
data are also representative to other isotherms. Detailed
analysis of LJ ﬂuids transport properties data existing in
the literature (in the context of the entropy scaling) can
be found in Ref. [38]. For a OCP ﬂuid we use the data
from MD simulations tabulated in Refs. [36, 37].

Figure 1 demonstrates that the minima of ηR and λR
are clearly observed (it should be noted that the exact
location of the minima can depend on the normalization
chosen). The magnitudes of transport coeﬃcients are
relatively close for HS and LJ ﬂuids: ηR (cid:39) 0.7 and λR (cid:39)
3.0 at the minimum in HS; ηR (cid:39) 0.6 and λR (cid:39) 2.7 at
the minimum in LJ. For the OCP ﬂuid the minima are
signiﬁcantly deeper: ηR (cid:39) 0.3 and λR (cid:39) 1.2. We believe
that this diﬀerence is due to extremely soft and long-
ranged character of the Coulomb potential.

In fact, the eﬀect of the potential softness on the loca-
tion and magnitude of the minima in the reduced shear
viscosity coeﬃcient was documented in Ref. [26]. In this
work the viscosity coeﬃcient was evaluated in the vicin-
ity of the minima for the inverse-power-law (IPL) repul-
sive potential family φ(r) = (cid:15)(σ/r)n, with various IPL

served that the location of the minima in terms of ex-
cess reduced entropy change almost monotonously from
sex/kB (cid:39) −0.71 for n = 6 to the hard sphere limiting
value of sex/kB (cid:39) −2/3 for n = 52. The magnitude of
the reduced shear viscosity coeﬃcient at its minimum in-
creases smoothly from ηR (cid:39) 0.45 at n = 6 to ηR (cid:39) 0.6 at
n = 52 (see Ref. [26] and related Supplementary Material
for further details).

the coupling parameter Γ in (c). The symbols connected by smooth curves correspond to the available data: Refs. [32, 33] for
a HS ﬂuid in (a); Refs. [34, 35] for a LJ ﬂuid along an isotherm T∗ = 2 in (b); and Refs. [36, 37] for a Coulomb (OCP) ﬂuid in
(c).

At the freezing points of the model systems consid-
ered in Fig. 1 we get roughly ηR ∼ 5 and λR ∼ 10 for
LJ and OCP ﬂuids, whereas somewhat higher values are
obtained for the HS ﬂuid, ηR ∼ 7 and λR ∼ 14.

V. REAL LIQUIDS

We have analysed experimental data for the viscosity
and thermal conductivity coeﬃcients of seven atomic and
molecular liquids along their supercritical isobars pro-
vided in the National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy (NIST) Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Trans-
port Properties Database (REFPROP 10.0) [47]. In par-
ticular, we have selected Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and N2 at 10
MPa, CO2 at 30 MPa, and CH4 at 50 MPa. The in-
dividual models for viscosity, thermal conductivity, and
equation of state for each species can be found in [48].

Figure 2 shows the data for the reduced viscosity, while
in Fig. 3 the reduced thermal conductivity data are plot-
ted. In both cases the horizontal axis corresponds to the
temperature normalized to its value at the freezing point,
T /Tfr. Minima are clearly observed (note again that the
location of the minima is not universal and can depend
on the normalization chosen). The emerging dependen-
cies are non-universal. This is of course not surprising,
because both transport properties are system-dependent.
In addition, the chosen isobars correspond to quite dif-
ferent trajectories on the phase diagrams of considered

substances (more similarity could be expected for in-
stance for isobars characterized by the same ratio P/Pcr,
where Pcr is the critical pressure). Nevertheless, Figure 2
demonstrates that the viscosity coeﬃcients of liquiﬁed
noble gases tend to group around a quasi-universal curve.

values of ηR all lie in a narrow range between 0.5 and
0.6. The minimal values of shear viscosity are seemingly
independent on whether the liquid is atomic or molecu-
lar. The minimal values of thermal conductivity do not
demonstrate this level of universality. For liquiﬁed noble
gases λmin
R (cid:39) 2.8 to a good accuracy, but for molecular
liquids it increases considerably. This could be expected,
because the thermal conductivity coeﬃcient is propor-
tional to the speciﬁc heat, which is higher for molecular
systems due to intramolecular degrees of freedom. How-
ever, the translational and internal thermal conductiv-
ity contributions cannot be straightforwardly decoupled
in a convincing way (see e.g. Ref. [50] and references
therein). In addition, the excess entropy scaling as well
as the vibrational model of heat transfer are applicable
to monatomic systems. Thus, we cannot quantify this
increase in any reasonable way from the theoretical per-
spective. What experimental results seem to indicate is
that the momentum transfer mechanism in the consid-
ered regime is much less sensitive to the molecular struc-
ture than the mechanism of energy transfer.

The values of ηR and λR at the freezing points show
more scattering. For liquiﬁed noble gases ηfr
R (cid:39) 4.2 ± 0.3
and λfr
R (cid:39) 9.9 ± 0.5 (note that ηR (cid:39) 5 − 6 for many
liquid metals at their corresponding melting tempera-
tures [51]). For molecular liquids scattering is more pro-
nounced. In cases considered, λR is 2-3 times larger than
ηR at the freezing point. Finally, it is observed that a
quasi-universal value of the thermal conductivity coeﬃ-
cient at the freezing point (∼ 10) is consistent with the
estimate we made using a simpliﬁed version of the Linde-
mann melting criterion. It appears that the reduced ther-
mal conductivity at the melting temperature is a more
robust quantity than the reduced shear viscosity (which
can diﬀer by several times for diﬀerent substances).

In a recent paper the behaviour of he shear viscosity
coeﬃcient of normal alkanes n-CN H2N +2 at the crystal-
liquid-vapour triple point has been investigated in de-
tail [52].

low-temperature viscosities of N2 and CH4 are above this
curve. Similar picture is observed in Fig. 3, except the
thermal conductivity data for neon are located consider-
ably lower than those of other liquiﬁed noble gases. Puz-
zled by this behaviour we also plotted the neon thermal
conductivity data from an older NIST Chemistry Web-
Book database [48]. These data are shown by red crosses
in Fig. 3 and are located much closer to those for other
noble elements. The discrepancy is signiﬁcant and prob-
ably deserves further attention. Both databases refer to
Ref. [49] as a main data source for liquid neon thermal
conductivity. This point is however beyond the scope
of the present paper. For the present consideration it is
important that the magnitudes of ηR and λR at their re-
spective minima do not vary strongly from one substance
to another.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The shear viscosity and thermal conductivity coeﬃ-
cients of various model and real ﬂuids usually exhibit
minima along trajectories that start from a dilute gaseous
state and end in a dense ﬂuid regime near the freez-
ing point. The origin of these minima is the crossover
between the gas-like and liquid-like dynamical regimes,
which corresponds to diﬀerent mechanisms of momen-
tum and energy transfer. It has been recently proposed
that the kinematic viscosity and thermal diﬀusivity coef-
ﬁcients have lower bounds, which are ﬁxed by fundamen-
tal physical constants [1, 2]. Moreover, the fundamental
lower limits of kinematic viscosity and thermal diﬀusivity
are numerically close [2].

The values of ηR and λR at the minima and at the
freezing points are summarized in Table I. The minimal

In this paper we have demonstrated that the minima
of properly reduced shear viscosity and thermal conduc-

12345604812lRT/Tfrtivity coeﬃcients can be estimated using purely classical
arguments. This observation is supported by the numer-
ical and experimental data on the transport properties
of various model and real ﬂuids (we should remark here
that although classical arguments do apply to real ﬂu-
ids, the details of the interatomic interactions are deter-
mined by quantum eﬀects and thus all the absolute mea-
surable quantities such as interatomic separation, melt-
ing temperature, Debye frequency, transport coeﬃcients,
etc. will in fact depend on quantum constants).

For monatomic ﬂuids considered (model and real) we
obtained ηmin
R = 0.6 ± 0.1 and λR (cid:39) 2.8 ± 0.2. The
only exception is the one-component plasma ﬂuid, where
these minimal values are considerably lower (ηR (cid:39) 0.3
and λR (cid:39) 1.2). This is related to the extremely soft
and long-ranged character of the Coulomb potential, in
agreement with the dependence of the transport coeﬃ-
cients minima on the interaction potential softness re-
ported previously. From the presented evidence we can
hypothesise that the OCP values can serve as classical
lower bounds on the viscosity and thermal conductivity

coeﬃcients of liquids. In non-reduced units we get:

For molecular liquids, the minimal value of ηR is close
to that in monatomic liquids. The minimal value of λR
somewhat increases, presumably due to the contribution
from additional degrees of freedom to the energy transfer.
We have also observed that the values of ηR and λR
at the respective freezing points of the considered sub-
stances are less universal than those at the minima. At
the same time, the vibrational model of heat transfer
combined with the simplest version of the Lindemann
melting criterion allows for a rough but reasonable es-
timate of the reduced heat conductivity coeﬃcient near
the ﬂuid-solid phase transition.

Altogether, these ﬁndings can represent an important
step to a better understanding of transport properties of
liquids across their phase diagrams.
