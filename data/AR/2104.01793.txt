ABSTRACT

There has been a recent tremendous interest in label-free detection of biomarkers which is a critical enabler of point-of-need
diagnostics.A low-power, small form factor, multiplexed wearable system is proposed for continuous detection of glucose in
passively expressed sweat using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. The wearable EIS system
consists of a sensing analog front end integrated with a low-volume (1-5 µL) ultra-sensitive ﬂexible biosensors. A passive
sweat sensor was designed integrating glucose oxidase electrochemical system on an active semiconducting material. The
non-faradaic EIS response of the biosensor was used to calibrate the analog front end’s response using ratiometric Discrete
Fourier Transform (DFT) for a shorter measurement time. In this work, a stringent assessment of a continuous glucose sensing
platform is performed in a bottom-up approach, going from the biosensor to the system system to the interaction with a human
subject. The active semiconductor-based biosensors are dosed with glucose concentrations ranging from 5-200 mg/dL and
detection is performed using the analog front end. In addition, detailed analysis of battery life and performance of a wearable
EIS system is discussed to deﬁne a ﬁgure of merit for an optimally integrated design. Moreover, a continuous glucose detection
test is performed on a healthy human subject cohort to investigate the stability of sensor-system mechanism for an 8-hour
period and a time-series based, auto-regressive (AR) model was created for the system.

Introduction

There is a signiﬁcant interest in wearable biosensing platforms in the recent times. Constant improvements are being made in
developing accurate and robust sensing mechanisms for various biomolecules of interest that demonstrate temporal dynamics.
Wearable biosensors are enablers for point of need tracking of chronic conditions and can be beneﬁcial both to the user as well
as the healthcare professional in guided therapy1. Glucose is a key biochemical marker with temporal dynamics in context
to monitoring chronic health condition of diabetic patients. Current technologies to monitor blood glucose in small and/or
wearable form factors still require frequent ﬁnger pricks or needle based interstitial blood glucose monitoring methods such as
the Abbott Freestyle Libre or the Dexcom G6 to be integrated with pedometers and other lifestyle management tools towards
achieving patient actionable glycemic control. Glucose biosensors, found commercially as well as in literature, implement a
microneedle-based, chronoamperometry2–5 and square-wave voltammetry6 biosensor compatible for wearable devices, due to
ease of electrical circuit implementation. These sensors may provide good sensitivity at the cost of larger sample volumes of
interstitial ﬂuid or sweat to adhere to acceptable CGM standards7. Moreover, due to larger settling time of current, density
gradients cause undesirable convective disruption of the diffusion layer8. In addition, large settling time of an amperometric
sensing scheme results in relatively higher current consumption.

There is an immense opportunity in designing a wearable electronic system towards supporting such point-of-need sensing
applications with low-volume, true no-needle insertion mechanisms. A case study of such a system is performed here by
coupling a low-volume passive sweat biosensor9 with a rapid response electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)-based
system10. The proposed glucose reporting mechanism utilizes passively expressed system sweat towards achieving quantitative
decision making; therefore low sample volume makes it prone to erroneous measurement in a real-world scenario. Error can
be deﬁned as a property of the system which introduces a deterministic undesirable offset in the measured outcome of the

 
 
 
 
 
 
device. In this context, deterministic offset would mean an offset that can be mathematically represented using a polynomial.
On the other hand, noise is a probabilistic property of the system which introduces a random offset in the measured outcome of
the system and is modeled as a probability distribution function. The presence of relatively higher noise and error affects the
battery performance of a device as it would require more samples to average or ﬁlter out the undesirable signal counterpart. In
this work, the sensor’s impedance change is reported and correlated to the conventional statistical methods to establish good
sensitivity. Continuous sensing of glucose dose concentration and differentiation of normal and hyperglycemic rate of change
of glucose is demonstrated in a healthy cohort of 20 subjects, using an auto-regressive model, in comparison to an interpolated
sweat glucose time series.

Results

Calibration of the system using lumped elements
The proposed system was tested for individual channel offset on the calibration channel of a universal dummy cell (Gamry
Instruments). Fig. 2 shows the variation of measured impedance of the universal dummy cell using n = 3 replicates of that same
system. It is seen that the measured impedance. The accuracy of the device is demonstrated in Fig.2a over n = 3 devices over
a single channel. The expected calibration impedance at 100Hz was 4kΩ. However, a systematic negative offset of 50Ω is
observed with a variability of 50Ω on the measured impedance. This accounts for a 1.25% inter-device variation along with a
−1.25% error. The precision of a single device replicate is observed by taking n = 100 measurements for all four channels
using the universal dummy cell. The peak inter-channel variability of 150Ω is observed.

Calibration dose response of the system
Glucose dose concentrations ranging from 5-200 mg/dL were made in synthetic sweat buffer with pH values 4, 6 and 8 were
introduced on a functionalized sensor and the impedance at 100Hz was recorded to demonstrate proof of binding interaction
on the sensor surface. Fig. 3a shows the response of the system as standard error of mean of the percentage change function
of impedance impedance to varying pH and dose concentrations with a linear ﬁt. Eqn. 1 shows the mathematical percentage
change of the measured impedance used to plot dose response. The system response shows 3% standard error on most of the
dose concentrations thus demonstrating precision of measurement.

Box-whisker plots were created as shown in Fig 3b to investigate the variability of the system response for a given dose
concentration irrespective of buffer pH. The true variability of the sensor response was observed to be 10% inter-sample
variation in the form of inter-quartile region height of each of the glucose dose concentrations. It can be observed that even with
a larger variability, the median divides the inter-quartile region symmetrically, demonstrating a Gaussian distribution. However,
there is a need to model this variation as a mathematical relationship to allow accurate detection as well as differentiation of
glucose dose concentrations across the dynamic range.

Identiﬁcation of sources of noise and error
Noise is an undesirable measured quantity that accompanies a true measured quantity. This introduces an amount of uncertainty
in the accuracy and repeatability of the measurement device. Sources of noise have been well characterized for CMOS devices
in the past11, 12. Primarily, the two major sources of noise discussed in academic as well as industrial design are thermal noise
and ﬂicker noise for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors. Thermal noise is a result of electrical
ﬂuctuations caused by thermal energy12. This electron motion is popularly known as Brownian motion. The RMS noise voltage
is expressed as in Eqn. 2 where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature in kelvin and R is the resistance of
the device under test. Thus, thermal noise will increase with rise in temperature. In CMOS transistors, this noise is a summation
of the noise generated by the gate and channel resistance. In case a capacitor is connected in parallel with the resistive noise
source, the RMS thermal noise is denoted as in Eqn. 3. Thus, thermal noise can be controlled using a shunt capacitor13.

Flicker noise or popularly known as 1/f noise is the resultant of attractive forces at the silicon-oxide interface in a CMOS
transistor giving rise to several energy states11, 13. The RMS ﬂicker noise is expressed as in Eqn. 4 where K is a statistically

2/14

calculated, process dependent parameter, W and L are the dimensions of the transistor, Cox is the capacitance of oxide ﬁlm per
square and f is the frequency of interest. Thus, 1/f noise is a function of frequency, and is a source of error for low frequency
circuits.

A noise model proposed by Hassibi and others14 is used to provide a noise treatment for the biosensors mentioned in
this work. For a non-faradaic electrode-electrolyte interface, the valence of the electrolyte is z. In addition, the measurement
is performed for a single frequency, thus the bandwidth of the system is 1 Hz. Fig 1c shows the incremental circuit model
established using impedance measurements in Munje et. al.9 and this work. Three noise sources due to Rs, RASA and Rct can be
identiﬁed using previously mentioned noise equations. Moreover, the measurement device’s response time of 13 ms is smaller
than the biosensor’s response time of 5 minutes. Based on these assumptions14, a noise model was proposed for the biosensor
used in this work as shown in Fig. 1d, which was derived from Fig. 1c9 by dividing the cross-section of the sensor in three parts.
Since an active semiconducting ﬁlm is a partially conductive ﬁlm with some resistance based on its doping levels, it is prone
to a noise voltage similar to a resistor and can be modeled as a thermal noise source. However, considering semi-conducting
properties of the ﬁlm in mind15, it can be assumed that there is a presence of 1/ f noise due to this ﬁlm, which is a result of
charge carrier generation as well as recombination. However, since a capacitance CASA exists in parallel with the noise sources,
this noise can be modeled as a kT /C noise of the active semiconducting ﬁlm. Considering the biosensing electrical double
layer and charge transfer resistance, these are modeled to be circuit components for an ideal polarized electrode (IPE), however,
they are imperfect in a real scenario. Thus, the noise of this region can be assumed to be a variation in the current density of the
charge carriers depending upon the strength of the electrical potential, which in turn depends on the location of the slip plane.
However, since the ion motion is slower than an electron’s motion, a function M(ω) is used to model the frequency dependent
effect of this current noise source. The solution resistance is a bulk effect and can be assumed to be a resistor, thus the thermal
noise effect. The ﬁnal expression of the noise voltage would be a summation of all these noise sources as given in Eqn. 5.

The veracity of this model is conﬁrmed using a noise test for 30 minutes on a non-functionalized sensor surface wet with
1X phosphate saline buffer(PBS) using a high-speed potentiostat (Zurich Instruments, Switzerland). Fig. 2c shows the variation
of noise spectra at an interval of 5 minutes. The noise voltage follows a trend inversely proportional the the frequency and is
maximum at t=5 minutes, whereas it decreases with time and is at a minimum at t=30 minutes at 100 Hz excitation frequency.
Thus, as the introduction of PBS reaches an equilibrium, the noise amplitude of the system start decreasing with respect to 100
Hz excitation frequency. The RMS noise voltage is shown in Fig. 2b.

Mean absolute relative difference (MARD)16 was used to emphasizes that noisy measurements are a function of the true
measurement and a summation of systematic bias and coefﬁcient of variation, to establish reliability of the wearable biosensor.
This expression is given as in Eqn. 6 where ˆG is the noisy measurement, G is the true measurement, %b is the systematic bias
obtained from the measurement system’s properties, %cv is the coefﬁcient of variation among each sample for the given dose
step and εn is a standard random variable. Thus, the systematic bias will be a constant offset correction where as the standard
variable which accounts for variation from external environmental effects in a band limited by %cv.

ˆG = G(1 + %b + %cv × εn)

(6)

This approach can be used to characterize sources of variability in system performance. Systematic offset can be observed
as a result of device accuracy and precision, offset of the measurement device and speciﬁc signal threshold of the biosensor.
Coefﬁcient of variation arises from sample-to-sample variation and is calculated as a ratio of standard deviation to mean for
a given dose concentration. In addition, environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity, variation in volume
dispensed, etc. play an important part in the system’s response. However, it would be an extensive effort to characterize for
each of them separately and superimpose. A standard normal variable can be used to account for all these variations. Thus,
variation is accounted for statistically, whereas systematic offsets are accounted for by observation and nulliﬁed by software
when using Eqn. 6.

Performance metrics for wearable devices
There is a need to encompass all important speciﬁcations as one numerical expression to represent the performance of an
electrical design in question relative to other alternative designs. This numerical expression is called the ﬁgure of merit (FOM).

Table 1. A simpliﬁed MARD model for the proposed wearable platform was created using sources of error as a percentage
component of the device under test in a real world environment in the presence of noise.

Such a design comparison is very popular among data conversion designs17 and is deﬁned as the energy required for one data
conversion. For deciding an expression for the ﬁgure of merit of a design, the system was split into the measurement device and
the biosensor and their inherent properties were observed.

For the measurement device, the ultimate objective to be achieved would be very similar to a data conversion system, i.e.
achieving a low power consumption per every measurement performed. Similarly, the capability of the device to measure with
minimal power will be observed by varying operating conditions. A battery operated device is generally operated at a very low,
sleep-mode supply current. However, the device requires a comparatively larger amount of current to operate in an active state.
Thus, for such an uneven distribution of current, an average over the time taken by the device to execute the program from
start to end. Thus, the battery selection for a ﬁxed average current is performed as follows. Let the sleep current of the device
in question is Isleep for time tsleep and the active current of the device is Iactive for time tactive. Since the device completes one
program cycle, the total time for one program cycle ttotal is the summation of tsleep and tactive.

The ﬁgure of merit (FOM) of an electrical device can be deﬁned as the energy spent to convert a physical sensor signal
at an instant of time. However, to demonstrate the increased throughput capacity of the device against power consumption,
parameters n and p were included, where n as number of sensors channels available by design and p is the number of points per
one measurement cycle. Here, one measurement cycle implies measuring all points until settling for amperometric designs, or
one sweep from lowest to highest frequency in impedance spectroscopy designs. For the proposed design, the ﬁgure of merit is

calculated for n = 4, p = 10, NBIT S = 16, fs =

A biosensor is expected to demonstrate a large dynamic range with a low order curve ﬁt equation for lesser computation
requirement and low power consumption. Moreover, it is expected that the biosensor is sensitive to the very low concentrations
of biomarkers of interest. Thus, the ﬁgure of merit (FOM) of a biosensor can be deﬁned as in Eqn. 10, where a relative
percentage value of the speciﬁc signal threshold and linear dynamic range are considered. thus, higher the FOM, higher the
ease of integration irrespective of dissimilar sensor, measurement device or electrochemical technique used or any combination
of the former.

%SST

The above mentioned ﬁgures of merit of individual system sub-blocks deﬁne the efﬁciency of the device to perform
under trade-offs under the designer’s control. However, if these are inconsistent between two sub-blocks of a system, the

4/14

integrated system may function inaccurately due to a cumulative effect of errors generated by individual sub-blocks. To ensure
maximum integrability of the measurement device and the biosensor, an attempt was made to mathematically deﬁne a statistical
relationship between sub-block accuracy. Accuracy A of a quantity is deﬁned as the difference between the actual value x of the
quantity and the ideal or true value X of the quantity as shown in Eqn. 11. Similarly, mismatch between two quantities x1 and
x2 is the difference between the actual ratio of the quantities and the desired ratio of the two quantities as shown in Eqn. 12. For
the proposed biosensor, the FOM of 11.87 if obtained for %LDR = 95% and %SST = 8%.

Both the accuracy and mismatch numbers should be zero for a perfectly non-erroneous measurement, which is a highly unlikely
in the presence of sources of variation and noise. Thus, this speciﬁcation helps a system integrator to analyze the quality of
sub-blocks available and investigate methods of error compensation, either by hardware or software. For the proposed system
system, for simplicity it is assumed that the since the measurement device and the biosensor are made of different materials, the
offsets are uncorrelated, thus additive. The accuracy of the measurement device is 1.25% as per Fig. 2a whereas the accuracy of
the biosensor is 10% as per the Fig. 3b. Thus, the mutual mismatch as a resultant of coupling both would be δ = −0.875% as
per Eqn. 12. For an optimal system level design, δ → 0 thus demonstrating the robustness of integration.

Continuous measurement testing
The dose calibration response of the sensor describes the accuracy of the system at a given steady state. In contrast, real-world
applications demand the need for providing a steady sensor output irrespective of change in environmental conditions. A
method of conversion of impedance measurements to real-time glucose measurements would bridge the gap between the sensor
output and the much-needed user information to be generated. Such a multi-variable problem can be solved using predictive
methods for time-series based analysis. Various models such as auto-regression18, 19 and neural network based approach20–24
have been used, as they consider the previous input, the previous output and the current input of the system. Also, these models
have been created using interstitial ﬂuid (ISF) based continues glucose monitoring systems (CGM), hence these are not based
on non-invasively sampled data sets.

A more simplistic approach is the application of time-series analysis to measurements provided by the proposed system.
The system was put on N=20 human subjects for a period of 8 hours, wherein their glucose sensor output, skin temperature,
skin humidity was measured continuously while 4 sweat samples were collected per subject. The sweat sample was used to
measure sweat glucose levels using a reference method. Since only 4 reference points were available considering the limitations
of the IRB, an interpolation curve was created using the 4 reference points to match the length of output of the system.

y = X1β1 + ... + X10β10 + µt

(1 − φ1L − ... − φ10L10)µt = (1 + θ1L + θ2L2 + θ3L3)εt

(13)

(14)

ARIMA(p,d,q) is one of the most commonly used curve ﬁt functions used for time-series analysis, where p is the order of
auto-regressive (AR) terms, d is the number of integrating terms and q is the number of moving -average (MA) terms. For the
above data set, p was determined using the number of signiﬁcant peaks in the auto-correlation plot of the primary predictors
impedance magnitude (Zmod) and ﬁrst differential of impedance magnitude (dZmod), which shows a change in sensor response
with change in glucose concentration as per dose calibration. Figs. 4a,4d show 2 extreme cases among the 20 data set, wherein
the auto-correlation plot shows 5 initial lag peaks for subject 1 and 10 initial lag peaks for subject 2, which exceed the 3σ
conﬁdence interval. Hence, the maximum peaks deﬁned p = 10. The ARIMA(10,0,3) regression curve ﬁt used for the above
data sets is given in Eqn. 13 and Eqn. 14, where y is the output, X are the input values for the predictors, β are the coefﬁcients
obtained from regression ARIMA ﬁt, µt is the variance, L is the lag operator, θ are the moving average coefﬁcients and εt is
Gaussian white noise.

The coefﬁcients of the ARIMA(10,0,3) curve ﬁt are shown in Table 2. The p-value for a given predictor deﬁnes its
signiﬁcance in predicting the output time series, which is the interpolated sweat glucose value. If p < 0.05, then the predictor

5/14

is assumed to be signiﬁcant as it rejects the null hypothesis, else the predictor can be assumed to be non-signiﬁcant, hence
can be removed from the curve ﬁt expression. In this case, predictors AR4 can be safely assumed to be not contributing to the
prediction. The AIC of this curve ﬁt was −3131.438, ensuring good curve ﬁt and low prediction error. This is corroborated by
the ARIMA outputs plotted against the interpolated glucose values in Figs. 5a, 5b. The error histogram is shown in Fig. 5c,
demonstrating a low predicted sweat glucose error with respect to the interpolated sweat glucose measurements.

Discussion

Various electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and impedance spectroscopy techniques
exist for the characterization of electrochemical cells and have been successfully employed for biosensing applications. However,
there has been less interest in design impedance spectroscopy device due to increased complexity required for phase as well
as magnitude detection on the hardware aspect. Moreover, added hardware increases the size and power consumption on a
system level scale for most designs. Thus, the ﬁrst wearable, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy system is proposed for
glucose detection in sweat with a battery lifetime of 215 hours. Moreover, a small form factor of the device is demonstrated by
implementing a monolithic SoC with an EIS dedicated front-end with four channel sensing. Table 3 compares the electrical
speciﬁcations and system level mechanism in general to highlight the advantages of using an impedance based spectroscopy
design over an amperometric design.

The proposed biosensor is capable of sensing glucose concentrations in sweat from 10 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL in various
synthetic sweat buffers of various pH values. Moreover, the stability of the sensor response is established not only from a
conventional statistical approach, but also using sample-to-sample variation observations and demonstrates a 20% variability
similar to safe limits on a Clarke Error Grid. In addition, for the ﬁrst time, a semi-quantitative method of detecting rate of
change of glucose is proposed for aiding real-time diagnostic efforts using a slope feature extraction algorithm on the impedance
response of the sensor. This algorithm also demonstrates a rate-of-change occurrence probability-based reduction in time
complexity, leading to low power operation on a wearable platform.

From a system level perspective, this work is a ﬁrst attempt to dive into the speciﬁcs of interdisciplinary system integration
for biosensing applications. A simplistic noise model for the biosensor is demonstrated along with noise measurements
to correlate with change of noise behavior in time based on conventional electrical circuit noise analyses. The analysis is
tested against noise measurements made on a high-speed potentiostat and mathematically veriﬁed. In addition, the accuracy
of the measurement device is identiﬁed and coupled to a source of error which corroborates the MARD based analysis of
sample-to-sample variability. Finally, a mismatch expression is proposed to demonstrate low mismatch due to coupling of the
biosensor and the measurement device with a mismatch coefﬁcient of -0.875%.

Methods

Sensor fabrication
Fig. 1a shows the cross-sectional view of the chemi-impedance biosensor and the formation of the immunoassay on the
functionalized surface. The biosensor substrate is a 100 µm thick,ﬂexible nanoporous polyamide substrate (GE Lifesciences,
NJ). Gold electrodes were patterned using shadow mask and deposited using e-beam cryo-evaporator. ZnO thin ﬁlms were
sputtered onto patterned in the area between the two gold electrodes to get maximum overlap using an AJA Orion RF magnetron
with a 99.999% ZnO target (Kurt J. Lesker) at room temperature9.

Materials for implementing glucose assay
Poly-amide substrates with 0.2 µm pore size were obtained from GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Piscataway, NJ, USA). The
linker molecule dithiobis [succinimidyl propionate] (DSP) and its solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were ordered from
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA). The monoclonal glucose oxidase antibody was obtained from Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA). Glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger and D(+)-glucose was obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The glucose antibody was diluted in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Synthetic sweat was prepared as per the recipe stated in M.T. Mathew et al. The pH range
is varied by varying the concentration of the components. Human sweat was purchased from Lee Biosolutions Inc. (St. Louis,
MO, USA), where it was collected from single human donor with pH ≈ 4–5. No preservatives have been added to this product
and it was stored unﬁltered at below - 20 °C9.

Wearable EIS device disassembly
The wearable EIS device used for experiments in this work is shown in Fig. 1f. The design is primarily divided into two
parts: a mother board and a daughter board. The motherboard houses the integrated circuits required for measurement and
communication. The daughter board houses four ﬂexible biosensors using slide-in connectors. The daughter board connects
to the motherboard using a slide-in connector as well. The motherboard is further divided into four subsections. The ﬁrst
subsection is the ADuCM350 system-on-chip (SoC) (Analog Devices Inc.) which is the heart of the wearable platform. It
is equipped with an impedance analyzer block which gives the real and imaginary part of an unknown impedance using a
ratiometric discrete Fourier transform (DFT) accelerator. The second subsection is the nRF8001 (Nordic Semiconductor
ASA) Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chip-set which communicates with a mobile application. The third subsection is the
temperature and RH sensing which was implemented using HDC1080 (Texas Instruments Inc.). The fourth subsection is the

7/14

power management system implemented using BQ24040 (Texas Instruments Inc.). This subsections supplies power to the other
subsection either using a lithium battery or USB and manages the charge-discharge cycle of the lithium battery.

Glucose sensor experimental protocol
Gold surface was functionalized with 3 µL of 10 mmol DSP linker after incubation for 2 hours. The PBS wash was carried out
followed by 15 min incubation of 3 µL of 10 µg/mL glucose oxidase antibody. Thereafter, 3 µL of 1 mg/mL glucose oxidase
enzyme obtained from Aspergillus Niger is dispensed. Serial dilutions of glucose in synthetic sweat were prepared to range
from 5 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL, which were dispensed after antibody incubation. Each glucose concentration was incubated for 5
minutes on the sensor surface prior to measurement. Sensor calibration response was obtained in human sweat with increased
glucose concentration doses from 5 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL with n=4 replicates of chips. Two test sample chips with 5 mg/mL
and 200 mg/mL glucose concentration doses on each were also measured. The average readings were then compared with the
values obtained from calibration dose response in human sweat. These EIS measurements were performed by recording current
ﬂow using ADuCM350 after applying 10 mV AC voltage with a frequency of 100 Hz.

Human subject enrollment
Human subjects for sweat sample collection and on-body continuous measurement in compliance with the protocol approved
by Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Texas at Dallas (IRB number 19-146). A written and informed consent
was obtained from all participants of this study. A study was performed on 20 subjects to collect sedentary sweat glucose, skin
temperature and RH over a period of 8 hours in compliance with the (IRB number 19-146) approved at the University of Texas
at Dallas. All subjects belonged to the age range of 18-40 years with no prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Each subject was
made to follow the following schedule: The subject will come in at T0 and has breakfast at T0.5 and blood glucose measures
are taken at T0 and T1, where n is the number of hours for a time instant Tn. The subject will have lunch at T3, and the blood
glucose will be observed at T4. A ﬁnal blood glucose measure will be taken at T8 to capture the fall in blood glucose over the
duration of experiment. The output of the proposed device and prediction system was validated against the interpolated sweat
glucose sample collected separately using a MacroDuct®sweat collector at above mentioned time points.

On-body measurement of human subjects
A written and informed consent was taken from all participants prior to sample collection. All enrolled subjects wore the devices
during the duration of the testing and continuous measurements were recorded in compliance with the protocol approved by
the IRB committee. The wearable sweat sensor device was placed on the antebrachial region (lower forearm) of the subject.
The human subjects were neither allowed to exert themselves physically nor their skin was excited using a sweat induction
method such as iontophoresis. This ensured a full passive generation of sweat to be sampled by AWARE. Continuous on-body
measurements sampled every minute for the duration of the testing and depending on the availability of the subject. The
concentration proﬁle of the biomarker was reported over the entire time period of recording.
