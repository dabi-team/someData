ABSTRACT
I explore the eﬀects of observational errors on nebular chemical abundances using a
sample of 179 optical spectra of 42 planetary nebulae (PNe) observed by diﬀerent
authors. The spectra are analysed in a homogeneous way to derive physical conditions
and ionic and total abundances. The eﬀects of recombination on the [O ii] and [N ii]
emission lines are estimated by including the eﬀective recombination coeﬃcients in
the statistical equilibrium equations that are solved for O+ and N+. The results are
shown to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than those derived using previous approaches. The
O+ abundances derived with the blue and red lines of [O ii] diﬀer by up to a factor
of 6, indicating that the relative intensities of lines widely separated in wavelength
can be highly uncertain. In fact, the He i lines in the range 4000–6800 ˚A imply that
most of the spectra are bluer than expected. Scores are assigned to the spectra using
diﬀerent criteria and the spectrum with the highest score for each PN is taken as the
reference spectrum. The diﬀerences between the abundances derived with the reference
spectrum and those derived with the other spectra available for each object are used
to estimate the one-sigma observational uncertainties in the ﬁnal abundances: 0.11 dex
for O/H and Ar/H, 0.14 dex for N/H, Ne/H, and Cl/H, and 0.16 dex for S/H.

1 INTRODUCTION

The chemical composition of the ionized gas in planetary
nebulae (PNe) provides information on the composition of
the interstellar medium when their progenitor stars were
formed and on the nucleosynthesis processes that take place
in these low and intermediate mass stars. This informa-
tion can be used to constrain the models of galactic chemi-
cal evolution and of stellar evolution. Chemical abundances
have been calculated for hundreds of Galactic PNe (see,
e.g., Quireza et al. 2007; Henry et al. 2010; Stanghellini &
Haywood 2018; Moll´a et al. 2019) and for dozens of extra-
galactic PNe in nearby galaxies (e.g., Kwitter et al. 2014;
Magrini et al. 2016, and references therein). When the PN
abundances are plotted as a function of their galactocen-
tric distances, they show a large scatter, and it is not clear
how much of that scatter is real. This might explain why
diﬀerent authors reach diﬀerent conclusions regarding the
slopes of the metallicity gradients and their time variation.
A much better understanding of the uncertainties that aﬀect
our abundance determinations is clearly needed.

PN chemical abundances are usually derived using op-
tical spectra, which in general cover the wavelength range
3700–6800 ˚A. The relative intensities of the diﬀerent emis-

sion lines that appear in this range can be used to determine
the physical conditions (electron density and electron tem-
perature) and the ionic abundances of several elements, like
He, O, N, S, Ne, Ar, and Cl (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).
Total abundances are calculated by adding the abundances
of all relevant ions or using ionization correction factors to
estimate the contribution of unobserved ions. Hence, three
sources of uncertainty in the ﬁnal results can be identiﬁed:
observational uncertainties, uncertainties in the atomic data
used in the calculations, and uncertainties resulting from de-
partures from our assumptions about the structure of the
objects (in density, temperature, metallicity, or ionization
structure).

I will focus here on the eﬀects of observational uncer-
tainties in the line intensity ratios used in our abundance
determinations. Observational uncertainties can arise from
a variety of sources: the eﬀects of atmospheric diﬀerential
refraction (Filippenko 1982), contamination by telluric ab-
sorption or emission (e.g., Smette et al. 2015), blends with
weaker nebular lines (e.g., Rodr´ıguez & Delgado-Inglada
2011), a poor signal to noise ratio, problems with the ﬂux
calibration, the extinction correction or any other part of the
reduction process, and even typos at the time of reporting
the measurements. Some authors report estimates of the un-
certainties aﬀecting their measurements but, these being just
estimates, they are likely to be somewhat subjective, and it

is unrealistic to expect that all possible sources of uncer-
tainty are included. This can be illustrated with the results
of Perinotto et al. (2004), who compared the abundances ob-
tained in a homogeneous way with spectra of the same PNe
observed by diﬀerent authors. Perinotto et al. propagated
the reported observational errors to the ﬁnal abundances,
and found that in 40 per cent of the objects the diﬀerences
in the oxygen abundances implied by the diﬀerent spectra
exceed the estimated errors. Perinotto et al. conclude that
the reported errors are probably underestimated.

Since many of the brightest Galactic PNe have been ob-
served more than once, one can use the spectra of the same
object obtained by diﬀerent authors to explore and constrain
the eﬀect of observational errors. Most of these objects are
extended, and the diﬀerent spectra are likely to cover dif-
ferent regions of the nebula. This means that the observed
intensities cannot be directly compared to infer their reliabil-
ity, but if one makes the assumption that the element abun-
dances do not vary signiﬁcantly across each nebula (at least
in the regions sampled by collisionally-excited line emission),
a comparison of the abundances derived from diﬀerent spec-
tra will provide an idea of the observational uncertainties.
This is the approach taken here, which is applied to 179
optical spectra of 42 PNe. Besides, diﬀerent features of the
observed spectra are used to explore their quality and to as-
sign them a score on this account. The data obtained from
this analysis and the procedure described below can be used
in the future to assign a quality to any observed PN spec-
trum and to relate this quality to the expected observational
uncertainties.

2 OBSERVATIONAL SAMPLE

The sample consists of 179 optical spectra of 42 PNe, each of
them with 3–7 spectra. The spectra were compiled from the
literature by looking for PNe that have three or more avail-
able spectra that contain: at least one working density di-
agnostic (from among [S ii] λ6716/λ6731, [O ii] λ3726/λ3729,
[Cl iii] λ5518/λ5538, and [Ar iv] λ4711/λ4740), the two most
used temperature diagnostics ([O iii] λ4363/(λ4959 + λ5007)
and [N ii] λ5755/(λ6548 + λ6583)), and the [O ii] λ3727 lines.
The [O ii] lines are required for the calculation of the
total abundances not only of oxygen, but of most of the
other elements through the use of ionization correction fac-
tors (see, e.g., Delgado-Inglada et al. 2014). The O+ abun-
dance can be calculated using either the [O ii] λ3727 lines
or the [O ii] λ7325 lines. The red [O ii] lines are weaker than
their blue counterparts and can be severely contaminated
by telluric emission lines. The blue [O ii] lines are not with-
out problems, since they lie in a spectral region where in-
struments can have a low eﬃciency and the eﬀects of at-
mospheric diﬀerential refraction might be important (Filip-
penko 1982), but they seem a safer bet. This is why the
presence of the blue [O ii] lines in the measured spectrum is
used as a selection criterion here. However, since 153 of the
179 compiled spectra have measurements of both the red and
blue [O ii] lines, it is possible to compare their performance,
as will be shown below.

The sample objects are Galactic PNe, although the
halo PN BoBn 1 might be located in the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal galaxy (Zijlstra et al. 2006). These objects and

the spectra used for their analysis are listed in Tables B1 to
B5.

3 ANALYSIS

The analysis is based on the extinction-corrected line ra-
tios provided by the diﬀerent authors. Most of the cal-
culations of physical conditions and ionic abundances use
PyNeb, a python-based package for the analysis of emis-
sion lines developed by Luridiana et al. (2015). Elec-
tron densities are derived from all available diagnostics
([S ii] λ6716/λ6731, [O ii] λ3726/λ3729, [Cl iii] λ5518/λ5538,
and/or [Ar iv] λ4711/λ4740), and their geometric mean is
used as the electron density, ne, in all calculations. The ge-
ometric mean, i.e., the average of the logarithmic values,
is used because it is more robust to the large variations in
ne introduced by observational or atomic-data uncertainties
when the diagnostics are near the limits of their validity.

The temperature values of Te[O iii] and Te[N ii], ob-
tained from the diagnostics [O iii] λ4363/(λ4959 + λ5007)
and [N ii] λ5755/(λ6548 + λ6583), are used to characterize
a two-zone temperature structure. The abundances derived
for He+, He++, O++, Ne++, S++, and Ar++ are based on the
value found for Te[O iii]; whereas the abundances of O+, N+,
S+, and Cl++ are based on Te[N ii]. The lines used in the
abundance determination, when available, are the follow-
ing: [O ii] λ3726 + 29, [O ii] λ7319 + 30, [O iii] λλ4959, 5007,
[N ii] λ6548 + 84, [S ii] λ6716 + 31, [S iii] λ6312, [Cl iii] λ5518 +
38, [Ar iii] λ7135, [Ar iv] λ4711 + 40, [Ne iii] λλ3868, 3967,
and He i λ4471, λ5876, λ6678.

The calculations use the atomic data listed in Table 1.
The choice of atomic data is based on diﬀerent consid-
erations discussed by Juan de Dios & Rodr´ıguez (2017,
and 2020, in preparation). The ionization correction fac-
tors used to derive total abundances are the ones calcu-
lated by Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014), except for nitro-
gen, where N/O=N+/O+ is used (see Delgado-Inglada et al.
2015). In the case of helium, the ﬁnal abundance is given as
He/H (cid:39) He+/H++ He++/H+. This will be a lower limit to
the total abundance whenever He0 has a signiﬁcant concen-
tration in the volume of ionized gas, but it can also be an
upper limit to the total abundance if He+ extends beyond
the region where H is ionized.

3.1 Corrections for the eﬀects of recombination

The calculations performed with the [O ii] lines have been
corrected for the eﬀects of recombination using the recom-
bination coeﬃcients of Storey et al. (2017). This is done by
adding to the statistical equilibrium equations for the four
levels that lie above the ground level (2s22p3 2Do

where ni is the population of level i of O+, Ai j and qi j are
the transition probability and the collisional excitation or
de-excitation rate between levels i and j, n(O++) is the O++
abundance, and αi is the eﬀective recombination coeﬃcient
to level i. The recombination coeﬃcients are interpolated
linearly from the tables provided by Storey et al. (2017) for
the values of ne and Te[O iii] found for each object. I use the
case B values of the recombination coeﬃcients since, accord-
ing to Storey et al. (2017), this case is a good approximation
for PNe. Case B considers that the nebula is optically thick
to permitted transitions from the O+ ground level.

The four equations resulting from equation (1) above for
i = 2–5, with n(O++) = (O++/O+) (cid:205)
i ni, along with the usual
ﬁfth equation, (cid:205)
i ni = 1, can be easily solved to derive the
level populations. However, since the recombination term of
the equation includes a dependence on the relative abun-
dances of O+ and O++, and since the derived O+ abundance
changes with the correction for recombination, it is neces-
sary to iterate. Using the condition that the O+ abundance
derived from either the blue or red [O ii] lines should change
by less than 0.02 dex in the last iteration, only up to three
iterations are needed in all cases but one. The exception is
the analysis performed with the spectrum of NGC 7009 ob-
tained by Kwitter & Henry (1998), where ﬁve iterations are
needed. The eﬀects of the correction for recombination in
the O+ abundances, in ne[O ii], and in the ﬁnal abundance
ratios are discussed below in Section 4.

In the case of [N ii], the recombination coeﬃcients of
Kisielius & Storey (2002) for case B can be used to intro-
duce the eﬀects of recombination in the statistical equilib-
rium equations of levels 4 and 5 of N+. The eﬀects of re-

combination will be proportional in this case to the N++/N+
abundance ratio, which, to a ﬁrst approximation, can be con-
sidered equal to O++/O+. Since the corrections for recombi-
nation for both [O ii] and [N ii] emission depend on O++/O+
and Te[N ii], in four cases it was necessary to iterate these
corrections, and for the spectrum of NGC 7009 obtained by
Kwitter & Henry (1998), the value of N++/N+ had to be re-
duced to 80 per cent that of O++/O+ in order to ﬁnd a solu-
tion. The corrections for recombination lead to lower values
of Te[N ii], with the diﬀerences being higher that 5 percent
in 23/179 spectra. The corrections start to be important at
O++/O+ > 30, especially for the lower values of Te[N ii]. The
largest correction, 3000 K or ∼ 20 per cent of the initial
value, is found for the spectrum of NGC 7009 of Kwitter &
Henry (1998), where, after the corrections for recombination
have been performed, O++/O+ (cid:39) 210 and Te[N ii] = 9700 K.
The eﬀects of the corrections for recombination of [O ii]
and [N ii] emission go in opposite directions since the cor-
rections decrease the values of Te[N ii] and O+/H+, but the
lower values of Te[N ii] lead to higher values of O+/H+, which
in turn imply lower corrections because of the dependence of
the corrections on O++/O+. The net eﬀect of the corrections
is that the values of Te[N ii] always decrease, whereas in most
cases the O+ abundances derived with the blue [O ii] lines
increase and those derived with the red [O ii] lines decrease.
This implies that if only one of the corrections is performed
(either the one for [O ii] or the one for [N ii]), the eﬀects
of this correction on the derived abundances will be higher
than the ones reported here.

The [O iii] λ4363 line can also be aﬀected by recombi-
nation, but this correction was not performed, since the for-
mula provided by Liu et al. (2000) implies that the change
in the intensity of this line is below three per cent in all the
spectra analysed here.

The physical conditions and ionic and total abundances
derived from each spectra are presented in Tables B1, B2,
B3, and B4, whose full versions are available online.

4 EFFECTS OF THE CORRECTIONS FOR
RECOMBINATION IN [O II] AND [N II]
EMISSION

Fig. 1 shows the eﬀects of the correction for recombination
in the derived values of ne[O ii], Te[N ii], and in the O+ abun-
dances obtained from the blue and red [O ii] lines. The dif-
ferences between the corrected values and the uncorrected
ones are shown as a function of the degree of ionization and
are colour/grey-coded to illustrate their dependence on ne
and Te[N ii]. The corrections are very small for ne[O ii], and
smaller that 0.05 dex for Te[N ii] and O+/H+ in most cases,
especially when O++/O+ < 10. Note that the size of the
corrections is larger for lower values of ne and Te[N ii]. This
reﬂects the larger impact that recombinations have on the
level populations when collisions are less important. The cor-
rections are larger for the O+ abundances obtained from the
blue [O ii] lines than for those obtained from the red lines.
This is due to the lower values of Te[N ii] introduced by the
recombination corrections. If the recombination correction
of [N ii] is not performed, the opposite eﬀect is observed: the
corrections are larger for the O+ abundances obtained from

4 M. Rodr´ıguez

the red [O ii] lines and the O+/H+ abundance ratio decreases
for both the blue and the red [O ii] lines.

Since the largest changes in O+/H+ occur when
O++/O+ >> 1, the corrections for recombination do not
introduce any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in O/H. On the other
hand, since the ionization correction factors for all elements
but O and He depend on O++/O+, the recombination correc-
tions introduce changes in the total abundances of N, Ne,
S, Cl, and Ar. These changes are below 0.05 dex in most
cases, but are larger, up to ∼ 0.3 dex, in the N, S, and Cl
abundances derived for some spectra. This is illustrated in
Fig. 2, where the diﬀerences between the total abundances
of N, S, and Cl derived with and without the recombinations
corrections are plotted as a function of O++/O+. The circles
and squares show the results obtained with the blue and
red [O ii] lines, respectively. The results obtained for N and
Cl are less sensitive to the recombination correction when
the blue [O ii] lines are used to derive the O+ abundances;
whereas the opposite is true for the S abundances. This re-
ﬂects the diﬀerent dependences on the physical conditions
of the emissivities of the lines used in the calculations. Since
the eﬀects for the S abundance are smaller than those for N
and Cl, and since the recombination corrections introduce
some uncertainty, these results indicate that the blue [O ii]
lines will in general lead to better estimates of the total
abundances.

4.1 A comparison between the two approaches

used to correct for the eﬀects of
recombination

Previous works have used the formulas provided by Liu et al.
(2000) to correct for the eﬀects of recombination the inten-
sities of [O ii] λ7325, [N ii] λ5755, and [O iii] λ4363 relative
to Hβ. These formulas estimate the contribution of recom-
bination to the intensities of these lines as a function of the
value of the electron temperature and the abundance of the
recombining ion. In order to derive these formulas, Liu et al.
(2000) calculate how recombinations populate the upper lev-
els of the lines. This approach, which is much simpler than
the one used here, will be a good approximation in the limit
of low density, when collisions do not change the population
balance introduced by recombinations.

I have compared the two approaches, using the same
atomic data in both cases, and ﬁnd that the alternative ap-
proach of Liu et al. (2000) does not lead to the same results.
In order to perform a more meaningful comparison, the cal-
culations that explore this low-density approach were per-
formed using as initial values the temperatures, densities,
and ionic abundances derived from the analysis described
above in Section 3.1, which includes the correction for re-
combination in the equations of statistical equilibrium for
O+ and N+. The case B recombination coeﬃcients of Storey
et al. (2017) and Kisielius & Storey (2002) were interpo-
lated from their tables and used to estimate what fraction
of the [O ii] and [N ii] line intensities arise from direct recom-
bination to their upper levels and from cascades involving
electric-quadrupole and magnetic dipole transitions.

Fig. 3 compares the values of O+/H+ and Te[N ii] esti-
mated with the two approaches. The O+ abundances can be
seen to diﬀer by up to ∼ 0.4 dex for both the blue and [O ii]
lines, although the results implied by the blue [O ii] lines are

in general more aﬀected. In fact, the corrections to the O+
abundance derived with the blue lines are mostly negative,
instead of positive, when the low-density approximation is
used. The results for N+ are slightly better, since the values
of Te[N ii] estimated with the two approaches diﬀer by 5–10
per cent only in a few cases. These non-negligible changes
imply that recombination and collisions cannot be treated
separately for these ions.

5 [O II] λ3727 VERSUS [O II] λ7325
Fig. 4 shows the diﬀerences between the O+ abundances im-
plied by the red and blue [O ii] lines, O+
b , before and after
the recombination correction, as a function of the degree of
ionization. The results are presented for the 153 spectra of
the sample that include measurements of both the blue and
red [O ii] lines. It can be seen from this ﬁgure that the cor-
rection improves the agreement between the blue and red
[O ii] lines, with the median value of O+
b changing from
0.12 to 0.09 dex after the correction.

r /O+

r /O+

However, the red lines are leading to systematically
larger O+ abundances, a result previously found by Stasi´nska
et al. (1998) and Escudero et al. (2004). This disagreement
might indicate that the corrections for recombination should
be higher (see, e.g. Nemer et al. 2019), but it could also
imply that the uncertainties in the measurement of the in-
tensities of the blue and red [O ii] lines relative to Hβ are
not symmetrical, with the intensities of the red lines being
more easily overestimated (because of contamination with
sky emission?) or with the blue lines being more easily un-
derestimated (because of the eﬀects of atmospheric diﬀer-
ential refraction?). As discussed below in Section 6.7, the
behaviour of the H i and He i lines suggests that the diﬀer-
ences in O+ are not due to systematic eﬀects introduced by
the ﬂux calibration or the extinction correction.

r /O+

I explored other possibilities: changing the atomic
data used for O+ (the transition probabilities and collision
strengths), increasing by 2000 K the temperature used to an-
alyze [O ii] emission, and decreasing the temperature used
for the correction for recombination to 4000 K (if this tem-
perature is reduced further, no solution to the statistical
equilibrium equations is found for several spectra). These
eﬀects might be important for some objects, but only an
increase in the temperature used to analyze [O ii] emission
leads to a decrease in the median value of O+
b (from
0.09 dex to 0.04 dex), and only at the expense of introduc-
ing very low values of O+

r /O+

b in several objects.

Much better results are obtained when using case C for
the recombination corrections, with the median diﬀerence
between the red- and blue-based O+ abundances decreasing
to 0.03 dex. However case C requires that permitted tran-
sitions arising from levels 2 and 3 of O+ are optically thick
and, in order to explain the results, this should happen in
objects with large values of O++/O+, which seems unlikely.
I used one of the models described below in Section 6.5
to get a tentative estimate of the optical depth of the transi-
tions arising from levels 2 and 3 of O+. The model is calcu-
lated with the photoionization code cloudy, version C17.01
(Ferland et al. 2017). It is a sphere of constant hydrogen den-
sity of 104 cm−3, an inner radius of 1016.5 cm, and typical
PN abundances and dust grains. The source of ionization

Figure 3. Diﬀerences introduced by ignoring the eﬀects of collisions in the corrections for recombination of the O+ abundances calculated
with the blue (left panel) and red (middle panel) [O ii] lines and of Te[N ii] (right panel, in K). The diﬀerences are plotted as a function
of O++/O+. The subscript ‘ld’ is used for the values calculated with the low-density approximation.

This does not necessarily imply that the electron density
in the [O ii] emitting region is larger than the one character-
izing other diagnostics, since the choice of atomic data deter-
mines the diﬀerences in density that are found with the dif-
ferent diagnostics (Juan de Dios & Rodr´ıguez, in prep.). Be-
sides, if the transition probabilities used for O+ are changed
to those identiﬁed in PyNeb as Z82-WFD96 (which use the
data of Zeippen 1982 and Wiese et al. 1996 for diﬀerent tran-
sitions), the median diﬀerences between ne[O ii] and ne[S ii],
ne[Cl iii], and ne[Ar iv] change to 0.03, -0.06, and -0.05 dex,
but the median of O+
r /O+
b does not change in a signiﬁcant
way. In order to get the median value of O+
b closer to
0, one would need to change the atomic data for S+, Cl++,
and Ar+3 so that their density diagnostics all lead to higher
values. As mentioned above, there might be other eﬀects in-
volved, like systematic uncertainties in the measurement of
the relative intensities of the blue and red [O ii] lines. A se-
lection of a large number of high quality spectra might shed
more light on this issue.

r /O+

On the other hand, note that the diﬀerences between
the O+ abundances implied by the blue and red [O ii] lines
shown in Fig. 4 have a large dispersion, with discrepancies
that easily reach 0.3 dex or more. This suggest that the mea-
surement of the relative intensities of the blue and red [O ii]
lines is very uncertain in many observed spectra. This also
implies that the total abundances for all the elements that
are based on the O+ abundance (directly or through the
use of ionization correction factors), will be diﬀerent when
derived with either the blue or the red [O ii] lines. The dif-
ferences in the total abundances implied by the blue and red
[O ii] lines are shown for the sample studied here in Fig. 5 as
a function of the degree of ionization. Diﬀerences of ±0.1 dex
are indicated by horizontal dotted lines in the ﬁgure. It can
be seen that in some extreme cases the diﬀerences are higher
than 0.1 dex for all elements excepting Ar. The eﬀects on
N/H are the most serious, with more than half of the spectra
leading to diﬀerences that are larger than 0.1 dex and can
surpass 0.5 dex.

Note that the blue and red [O ii] lines, at λ = 3727 and
7325 ˚A, lie at the edges of the wavelength range that contains
all the lines generally used to determine physical conditions
and chemical abundances. The fact that their relative in-
tensities are diﬃcult to measure properly suggest that other

τ (cid:39) 0.07. This seems to rule out case C as the explanation
for the overabundances calculated with the red [O ii] lines.
Another possible explanation for the high values of
O+
b is an underestimate of the electron density. Indeed,
this is clearly aﬀecting several spectra, since eight of the ten
spectra that imply log(O+
r /O+
) > 0.4 also lead to the lowest
b
density values for their corresponding PNe. In fact, for those
spectra that allowed the calculation of ne[O ii], the median
diﬀerence between this density and the adopted one is equal
to 0.08 dex. If all the spectra are reanalyzed increasing their
adopted densities by 0.08 dex, the median value of O+
r /O+
b
decreases from 0.09 dex to 0.045 dex. Since in those spectra
where ne[O ii] can be measured, the value enters in the de-
termination of the adopted electron density, the eﬀect could
be higher for other cases. In fact, with the set of atomic data
used here, ne[O ii] is systematically higher than the other di-
agnostics, with median diﬀerences with respect to ne[S ii],
ne[Cl iii], and ne[Ar iv] of 0.17 dex, 0.12 dex, and 0.07 dex.
With an increase of 0.2 dex in density, the median value of
O+
r /O+
b becomes negative, −0.024 dex. Hence, it seems pos-
sible to explain the higher than expected values of O+
r /O+
b
as arising from density underestimates.

important line ratios will also have smaller but still impor-
tant uncertainties.

So, which lines are better suited to calculate abun-
dances? The blue or the red [O ii] lines? Both sets of lines
have advantages and disadvantages. The blue lines are very
sensitive to the eﬀects of atmospheric diﬀerential refraction
(Filippenko 1982) and are in a region of the spectrum where
our instruments are generally not very eﬃcient. On the other
hand, the red lines can be severely aﬀected by telluric emis-
sion and are more sensitive to uncertainties in the electron
temperature. As shown above in Section 4, the total abun-
dances derived with the red lines are also more sensitive in
general to the eﬀects of the correction for recombination.
The disadvantages of the red lines seem more serious than
those aﬀecting the blue lines, suggesting that the blue lines
should be preferred, especially when problems with atmo-
spheric diﬀerential refraction are not an issue.1

6 SPECTRA QUALITY

The simplest approach one can use to get an estimate of
the chemical abundances and their observational uncertain-
ties in each PN is to get an average of the results derived
with diﬀerent spectra and to calculate the deviations from
this average. However, there are only 3–7 spectra per object,
which means that poor-quality spectra will have a large ef-
fect in the results. In fact, with so few determinations per
PN, the estimates of the mean values and their uncertain-
ties can be seriously biased. A second approach that can be
used is to get a weighted average of the results, using some
estimate of the observational errors or the spectra quality

1 This can be a diﬃcult problem to tackle, since for most of the
published spectra no information is provided on the airmass at
the time of observation.

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2020)

in order to decide the contribution of each spectra to the
ﬁnal results. The disadvantage of this approach is that the
weighting procedure is unlikely to be perfect and might as-
sign some weight to spectra that should be discarded. A good
alternative is to identify for each object the spectrum that
can be considered more reliable, and to use this spectrum
as the reference for the chemical abundances of the object.
The diﬀerences between the abundances derived with the
other available spectra and the ones provided by the refer-
ence spectrum can then be used to explore the uncertainties
in the results.

Note that since there are at least three spectra per ob-
ject, a comparison of the results obtained with each of them
makes it possible to trace the causes of some of the diﬀer-
ences in the ﬁnal abundances. For example, the spectrum of
Girard et al. (2007) for NGC 6369 leads to the lowest val-
ues of electron temperature for this object: Te[N ii] = 8900 K
and Te[O iii] = 8000 K versus Te[N ii] = 10700–13000 K and
Te[O iii] = 9700–11600 K with the other four spectra avail-
able for this PN. All the derived ionic abundances, except-
ing He+/H+ and S++/H+, are systematically higher for this
spectrum. The ﬁnal abundances are also higher, with the
exception of N/H and S/H, which illustrates not only the
interdependence of the derived parameters but also the fact
that several diﬀerent sources of error are aﬀecting the re-
sults. A similar eﬀect happens with the spectra of Aller
et al. (1996) and Hyung et al. (1997) for NGC 6790 and
NGC 6884, respectively, which also lead to the lowest tem-
peratures for these objects. In the case of NGC 6884, all
the total abundances, excepting He/H, are systematically
higher, by 0.3 dex in O/H, for the spectrum observed by
Hyung et al. (1997). However, many of the diﬀerences in to-
tal abundances cannot be traced back to diﬀerences in tem-
perature or any other single parameter. This implies that
the quality of the spectra should be explored using as many
criteria as possible. I discuss below diﬀerent criteria that can

be used to explore the quality of the spectra and to assign
scores to the spectra.

6.1 CCD

Some of the spectra, 47/179, were not obtained with a CCD
but with detectors whose measurements might be more un-
certain because of the eﬀects of non-linearity (see, e.g., Peim-
bert & Torres-Peimbert 1987). On this account, the spectra
are assigned a score of 10 when they have been observed
with a CCD spectra and a score of 0 otherwise. The validity
of this approach is examined below.

6.2 Electron temperature

The electron temperature is one of the critical parameters
needed to determine nebular abundances. Besides, we know
that nebulae can have diﬀerent temperatures in regions that
diﬀer in their degree of ionization. The best estimates of the
electron temperature in the high- and low-ionization regions
are Te[O iii] and Te[N ii]. All the sample spectra used here
have these two values of electron temperature and 20 points
are assigned to these spectra because of this. Other spectra
with just one of these temperatures might be assigned a
score of 15, whereas spectra with no estimate of Te would
receive a score of 0 in this item.

6.3 Electron density

A good measurement of the electron density is also critical
in the determination of nebular chemical abundances, espe-
cially when the density is larger than a few hundred parti-
cles per cm−3, as in many of the observed PNe. The most
useful diagnostics are [S ii] λ6716/λ6731, [O ii] λ3726/λ3729,
[Cl iii] λ5518/λ5538, and [Ar iv] λ4711/λ4740. These diag-
nostics sample somewhat diﬀerent ionization regions in the
nebula. Thus, when several of them are measured, they can
be used to obtain a better estimate of the density, and when
measured with low uncertainty, they can also provide in-
formation on the density structure of the nebula. Besides,
the number of density diagnostics that can be measured will
depend not only on the physical conditions and degree of
ionization of the PN, but also on the signal to noise ratio
of the observed spectrum, so this number can be considered
to provide some indication of the spectrum quality. Scores
of 9, 11, 13, or 15 are assigned to the spectra when they
contain one, two, three, or four working diagnostics. A spec-
trum with no working diagnostic would get an score of 0 in
this item.

6.4 [O III] and [N II] line ratios

The [O iii] λ5007/λ4959 and [N ii] λ6584/λ6548 line intensity
ratios involve transitions that arise from the same energy
level in each ion. Hence, these line ratios must have a ﬁxed
value, determined by the energy of the transitions and the
transition probabilities. Since the lines in both pairs are very
close in wavelength, the values measured in any spectra for
these line ratios should not be aﬀected by problems with
the ﬂux calibration and extinction correction or with atmo-
spheric diﬀerential refraction. A comparison between their

and [N ii] λ6584/λ6548 line intensity ratios for the sample spec-
tra. The dashed lines show the positions of the median values
at 3.00 for [O iii] and 3.03 for [N ii]. The darker areas show the
distributions for the spectra that achieve ﬁnal scores larger than
85.

observed values and the theoretical ones will reﬂect how well
the intensities of relatively strong emission lines can be mea-
sured in the spectra.

However, the theoretical predictions for these line ratios
usually diﬀer among themselves (see, e.g., Froese Fischer
et al. 2009) and from the observations. With the atomic
data used here (Table 1), the predicted values for the [O iii]
and [N ii] line ratios are 2.98 and 2.94, respectively. These
theoretical ratios are slightly lower than the ones obtained
from the median values of the sample spectra: 3.00 for [O iii]
and 3.03 for [N ii], and I decided to use these observational
values as the reference values. Fig. 6 shows the distributions
of values of the [O iii] λ5007/λ4959 and [N ii] λ6584/λ6548
line ratios for the sample spectra, with the positions of the
median values marked with dashed lines.

The scores based on each of these line ratios are as-
signed as follows. For each line ratio, a linear relation is
used: pi = 10 − 312.5 | log(ri/rmedian)|, where ri is the observed
line ratio and rmedian its median. The values obtained for pi
are rounded to the next integer. With i = 2 for [N ii] and
i = 3 for [O iii], the values of p2 and p3 shown in Table B5
are obtained. The maximum score that can be obtained with
this procedure is 10 for each line ratio; the minimum is 0.
The minimum is assigned when the logarithmic diﬀerences
from the median are larger or equal to 0.032 dex or when
one of the lines is missing.

6.5 He I lines

There are many He i lines across the nebular spectra that
have strong to medium strengths, and most observers report
the intensities of several of them. A comparison between the
He+ abundances derived from these lines can thus be used
to assess the spectra quality.

Not all He i lines are equally useful for this purpose,
however. The intensities of some of them, like He i λ7065
and He i λ3889, depart from their predicted case B values
because they are very sensitive to changes in the optical
depth of transitions connecting the 2s 3S and 1S energy levels
with levels of higher energy.

the case B predictions for their intensities, I ran several sim-
ple models using the photoionization code cloudy (version
C17.01, Ferland et al. 2017). I used the prescriptions de-
scribed by these authors in their Section 3.1.1 for the num-
bers of resolved and collapsed levels required to get good
estimates of the He i line intensities, and changed the opti-
cal depths of each individual model by introducing micro-
turbulence or by removing the outer ionized layers of the
model. The models are spheres ionized by a blackbody with
a temperature of Teﬀ = 5 × 104 or 105 K and a luminosity
of L = 1037 erg s−1. The hydrogen density of the models is
constant and equal to nH = 103, 103.7, or 104 cm−3, the inner
radius is Rin = 1015 cm (for the models with Teﬀ = 5 × 104 K)
or 1016.5 cm (for Teﬀ = 105 K), and the models are either
radiation-bounded, or matter-bounded with thickness in the
range ∆R = 1016.6–1017 cm. Some of the models also include
the eﬀects of turbulence in the line widths, with velocities of
either vturb = 15 or 30 km s−1. The models have the typical
PN chemical abundances deﬁned in cloudy and the ‘ISM’
dust grain properties that come by default with these abun-
dances.

The diﬀerent parameters of the models do not cover the
range of PN typical values (see, e.g., Miller Bertolami 2016;
Delgado-Inglada et al. 2014) and are not explored in a sys-
tematic way. However, the models are only used to explore
the variations in the relative intensities of the He i lines in-
troduced by changes in the optical depth of the resonant
He i transitions. Hence, the results are expected to be insen-
sitive to changes in the eﬀective temperature of the ionizing
radiation ﬁeld or in its source (i.e., a blackbody versus a
stellar atmosphere). Besides, the results can be compared
with those obtained from the observations in order to check
for their consistency.

The lines whose behaviour is explored with the models
are He i λ3614, λ3965, λ4026, λ4388, λ4438, λ4471, λ4713,
λ4922, λ5016, λ5048, λ5876, λ6678, λ7065, and λ7281. These
lines sample diﬀerent types of transitions: 2 1S–n 1Po (λ3614,
λ3965, λ5016); 2 3Po–n 3S (λ4713, λ7065); 2 1Po–n 1S (λ4438,
λ5048, λ7281); 2 1Po–n 1D (λ4388, λ4922, λ6678); and 2 3Po–
n 3D (λ4026, λ4471, λ5876). The He i λ3889 line (2 3S–3 3Po)
is not included because it is usually blended with the H8 line,
but the optical depth of this transition, τλ3889, whose value is
provided by cloudy, is used as a proxy for the optical depth
of all He i transitions. The models cover a relatively large
range of optical depths, τλ3889 = 0.3–18, which seems enough
to reproduce the observed diﬀerences in the behaviour of the
He i lines.

Fig. 7 shows the results for three models that sam-
ple the diﬀerent behaviour of the He i lines. The model
with τλ3889 = 0.3 has Teﬀ = 5 × 104 K, nH = 103 cm−3,
Rin = 1015 cm, ∆R = 1017 cm, and vturb = 15 km s−1. The
model with τλ3889 = 0.6 has Teﬀ = 105 K, nH = 103.7 cm−3,
Rin = 1016.5 cm, ∆R = 1016.8 cm, and vturb = 15 km s−1. The
third model shown in Fig. 7, the one with τλ3889 = 18, has
Teﬀ = 105 K, nH = 104 cm−3, Rin = 1016.5 cm, ∆R uncon-
strained (i.e., radiation-bounded), and no turbulence. For
each model, the He+ abundances implied by the diﬀerent
lines are calculated with PyNeb using the average electron
density of the model and the electron temperature in the
O++ region (the results are not sensitive to small changes
in these parameters). Fig. 7 shows the diﬀerences between

sponding to the He i λ4026, λ4388, λ4471, λ4922, λ5876, and λ6678
lines, which lead to very similar He+ abundances, are shown with
stars; the results for the lines that can be aﬀected by changes in

and λ7281, are represented with crosses.

these abundances and those implied by the He i λ4471 line
as a function of wavelength.

The results presented in Fig. 7 suggest that all the
lines arising from the transitions 2 1Po–n 1D and 2 3Po–n 3D,
whose results are represented with stars in Fig. 7, are mostly
insensitive to optical depth eﬀects, with deviations from
their case B values lower than 0.02 dex. Hence, the rela-
tive abundances implied by He i λ4026, λ4388, λ4471, λ4922,
λ5876, and λ6678 can be used to assign a quality to the
spectra.

Fig. A1 shows the diﬀerences between the He+ abun-
dances implied by the various He i lines discussed above and
the abundance implied by He i λ4471 for several of the sam-
ple spectra. The circles in Fig. A1 present the results for
the He i lines that are not expected to be aﬀected by optical
depth eﬀects; the squares show the results for the other lines.
Each panel in Fig. A1 is identiﬁed with the PN and the spec-
trum reference; the ﬁnal score attained by each spectrum is
also plotted. It can be seen in Fig. A1 that several spectra
lead to a very good agreement in the abundances implied by
the He i lines that are expected to be insensitive to optical
depth eﬀects according to the models, indicating that there
is a general consistency between models and observation in
this issue. On the other hand, the spectra that show the
largest diﬀerences usually show a dependence of these dif-

ferences on wavelength, suggesting that the diﬀerences could
be due to problems with the ﬂux calibration.

Taking into account all of the above, I decided to as-
sign scores to the spectra using the ‘unaﬀected’ He i λ4026,
λ4388, λ4471, λ4922, λ5876, and λ6678 lines. A score of 2
is assigned to those spectra that present the intensity of at
least one He i line from the six listed above. For spectra
that include the measurement of several He i lines, the He+
abundance derived from each line is compared with the mean
abundance implied by the brightest He i lines, λ4471, λ5876,
and λ6678. If the diﬀerence in the logarithmic abundances
is lower than 0.04 dex, a score of 3 is added to the previous
score; if the diﬀerence lies between 0.04 and 0.08 dex, a score
of 2 is added; and if the diﬀerence is larger than 0.08 dex, a
score of 1 is added (just because one additional line could be
measured). This is done for each available line in the list of
‘unaﬀected’ lines. With this procedure, the maximum score
that can be achieved in this part is 20.

6.6 H I lines

Several H i lines from the Balmer and Paschen series can be
observed in the optical and near-infrared spectra of ionized
nebulae. Most of them are outside the spectral range that
is usually observed, and those that are generally measured,
like Hα, Hβ, Hγ, and Hδ, are used to determine the amount
of extinction aﬀecting the observed spectrum. This means
that in most cases they cannot be used in the same way as
the He i lines to provide a quality assessment. However, if
three or four of these Balmer lines are measured, the degree
of agreement of their relative intensities with the predicted
values provides some indication of the spectra quality.

Fig. A2 shows

the departures of

Several spectra do include the measurements of Paschen
lines and several other Balmer lines. These extra lines
bracket the spectral range where the lines used in the abun-
dance determination are located, and go beyond them in
the blue and red spectral ends. The comparison of their
extinction-corrected relative intensities with the theoretical
ones can in principle be used to explore not only how well
the spectrum allows the measurement of lines that have dif-
ferent intensities but also how well the ﬂux calibration and
extinction correction are working. There is one drawback,
though: the Balmer and Paschen can depart from their pre-
dicted case B values, especially when the quantum numbers
n of their upper levels are large (Mesa-Delgado et al. 2009).
the observed,
extinction-corrected intensities of the Balmer and Paschen
lines relative to Hβ from the values predicted by case B
for several of the sample spectra. The results are presented
as a function of the principal quantum number n of the
upper level of the transition. In some cases, like those of
the spectra for Cn 1-5, M 1-25, and PC 14 from Garc´ıa-
Rojas et al. (2012) (GPMDR12 in Fig. A2) and the spec-
tra for IC 418 from Dopita et al. (2017) and Sharpee et al.
(2003) (DASNA17 and SWBvH03 in Fig. A2), the Balmer
and Paschen lines show small departures from their case B
values and a dependence of these departures on n, which
suggest that the deviations are real. Other cases are more
diﬃcult to interpret, like the diﬀerent behaviour shown by
the H i lines in the three spectra of NGC 7009 from Fang
& Liu (2011), Hyung & Aller (1995a) and Hyung & Aller
(1995b) (see Fig. A2). In many cases, the departures of the

H i line ratios increase with n, an eﬀect that might be real
or due to the diﬃculties inherent in measuring the weaker
lines arising from levels with higher values of n.

Taking all of the above into consideration, I decided
to assign an score of 6 to those spectra that had indepen-
dent measurements of at least two of the three lines Hα, Hγ,
and Hδ (Hβ is present in all the sample spectra) if all their
intensities relative to Hβ are within 0.05 dex of their ex-
pected values according to case B. Besides, for those spectra
with measurements of at least one Balmer and one Paschen
line with upper levels in the range n = 9 to 20, the ratios
of their observed (extinction-corrected) to their predicted
case B intensities were used to obtain the median devia-
tions of these Balmer and Paschen lines. These deviations
were then compared (Paschen minus Balmer), and if they
diﬀered by 0.10 to 0.15 dex, 0.05 to 0.10 dex, or by less than
0.05 dex, the spectrum was assigned an extra score of 3, 6, or
9, respectively. This procedure is based on the assumption
that Balmer and Paschen lines originating from levels with
similar values of n will show similar deviations from their
case B values. The validity of this assumption will need to
be explored once a suﬃcient number of high-quality spec-
tra have been identiﬁed. This could be done using the other
quality criteria listed above.

The procedure described above results in scores in the

range 0–15 based on the behaviour of the H i lines.

6.7 A comparison of the results obtained with the

H I and He I lines

Since the He i lines whose behaviour is compared here cover
the wavelength range 4026–6678 ˚A, they can be used to ex-
plore the trends introduced in this range by problems with
the ﬂux calibration or related eﬀects. A comparison of these
trends with those that can be inferred from the behaviour
of the H i Balmer and Paschen lines that lie to the blue and
red of this wavelength range can shed light on the kind of
observational uncertainties aﬀecting the spectra.

The results shown in Fig. 8 indicate that there is some

although with some dispersion, which is to be expected if
the deviations are not linear with wavelength, as illustrated
by the behaviour of the diﬀerent He i lines in several spec-
tra (see Fig. A1). On the other hand, whereas half of the
spectra are redder than expected for ‘Paschen − Balmer’
and half are bluer, most of the spectra are bluer than ex-
pected according to the He i lines. Since large changes in

The results for the [O ii], He i, and H i lines, if inter-
preted in terms of the relative intensities of the blue and
red lines of each ion, indicate that the spectra are bluer
than expected between 4026 and 6678 ˚A (He i lines), redder
than expected between 3727 and 7235 ˚A ([O ii] lines), and
about right between ∼ 3700 and ∼ 8500 ˚A (H i lines). Since
the spectra have been obtained using diﬀerent techniques
and corrected for extinction with diﬀerent extinction laws,
it seems diﬃcult to explain these colour variations using a
single cause, such as the eﬀect of biases introduced by the
ﬂux calibration or the extinction correction. On the other
hand, both the ﬂux calibration and the extinction correction
could be introducing systematic errors in the line intensities.
Besides, as discussed in Section 5 above, atmospheric diﬀer-
ential refraction and atomic data can also be responsible for
the discrepancy between the results implied by the blue and
red [O ii] lines.

6.9 Final scores and observational uncertainties

The ﬁnal score of each spectrum results from the addition
of the scores obtained in each of the items described in this
section. The maximum possible score for each spectrum is
100, and the spectra analysed here have scores in the range
40–99. Table B5 lists the partial and ﬁnal scores for all the
spectra analysed here. Columns 1 and 2 identify the PN and
the reference for the spectrum; column 3 provides the score
related to whether the spectra was obtained with a CCD
(p0 = 10) or not (p0 = 0); column 4 gives the score related to
the available temperature diagnostics (p1 = 20 for the two di-
agnostics available in the spectra of this sample); columns 5
and 6 list the number of density diagnostics and the re-
lated score (p2 = 9–15 for 1–4 working density diagnostics);
columns 7–10 give the values of the [O iii] λ5007/λ4959 and
[N ii] λ6584/λ6548 line ratios and their associated scores (p3
and p4, both in the range 0–10); columns 11 and 12 give the
number of He i lines unaﬀected by optical depth eﬀects avail-
able in the spectra (out of the six listed above in Section 6.5)
and the score assigned according to how consistent are the
He+ abundances implied by them (p5 = 2–20, where 2 is the
score when only one He i line is available); columns 13–15 list
the number of Balmer lines (out of Hα, Hγ, and Hδ) whose
intensities are listed in the spectra, the diﬀerence between
the median deviations of the Paschen and Balmer lines from
their expected values, and the score assigned the behaviour
of all these lines (p6 = 0–15, see Section 6.6); and column 16
provides the ﬁnal score obtained from the addition of the
previous ones (ptot, with a maximum value of 100).

An inspection of Table B5 shows that some spectra have
low scores because they do not contain all the information
used to assign scores. This can be due to their limited wave-
length coverage or spectral resolution, to their low signal-to-
noise not allowing the measurement of relatively weak lines,
or to the presence of saturated features (like [O iii] λ5007).
The case of the spectra presented by Pe˜na et al. (1998) and
Pe˜na et al. (2001) is particularly noteworthy in this respect,
since these are the CCD spectra that show the lowest scores.
As will be shown below, these spectra are not performing as
badly as one might expect from their scores, but the low
scores arise from an extreme lack of information, since the
authors only present the intensities of the brightest lines that
they require for their analysis.

electron density or temperature do not change signiﬁcantly
the behaviour of the He i and H i lines, this could be a real
systematic eﬀect of the ﬂux calibration. As an alternative
explanation of the bluer than expected spectra implied by
the He i lines, one might consider the eﬀects of He i absorp-
tion lines in the central stars of the PNe. However, most of
the sample PNe are extended objects, and this kind of eﬀect
is found in some spectra that do not include the central star
in the observed area, like the spectrum of Hyung & Aller
(1998) for NGC 2440 (see Fig. A1).

6.8 A comparison with the results obtained with

the blue and red [O II] lines

r /O+

Since the red and blue lines of [O ii] are located at 3727
and 7325 ˚A, a comparison of the O+ abundances implied
by these two sets of lines can provide complementary infor-
mation on the eﬀects of the ﬂux calibration explored with
the He i and H i lines. However, as discussed in Section 5,
the relative abundances derived with the red and blue [O ii]
lines with the sample spectra, O+
b , are larger than one in
most cases, an eﬀect that can be real or due to the choice of
the density structure and of the atomic data. Nevertheless,
a comparison of the trends followed by O+
b with those
implied by the He i and H i lines might be valuable.

The left panel of Fig. 9 shows the values of O+

the procedure described above. Filled circles show the results

spectra. The dispersion in O+

for the spectra with higher scores, suggesting that most of
the dispersion is introduced by observational errors.

and H i lines, although there is dispersion probably arising
from the eﬀects of diﬀerent sources of observational errors.

discrepancies in log(O+

ferent density structures or atomic data, but the problems
presented by these spectra suggest that we should aim for
spectra that have scores higher than 80 for each object of
interest.

The spectrum with the highest score for each object
can now be used as a reference, and the diﬀerences between
the results obtained with the available spectra and with the
reference spectra will provide estimates of the uncertain-
ties introduced by observational problems. Fig. 11 shows the
absolute values of the diﬀerences in the adopted densities,
Te[N ii], and Te[O iii] as a function of the ﬁnal scores. Some
of these diﬀerences might be due to the fact that the dif-
ferent spectra can be sampling diﬀerent regions of the PNe.
However, since the magnitude of the diﬀerences decreases
for higher scores, most of them seem to be attributable to
observational errors. The dashed lines in Fig. 11 are the up-
per limits that contain 68 per cent of the diﬀerences, and can
thus be interpreted as one-σ errors: 0.23 dex for ne, 0.05 dex
for Te[N ii], and 0.03 dex for Te[O iii].

Fig. 12 shows the absolute values of the diﬀerences in
the chemical abundances relative to the reference spectrum
of each PN. These abundances have all been derived using
the O+ abundances implied by the blue [O ii] lines. The dif-
ferences decrease for higher scores, but not in a completely
consistent way: it seems that a larger sample will be needed
to relate a score with its observational uncertainty. The one-
σ observational uncertainties are equal to 0.11 dex for O/H,
0.14 dex for N/H, 0.14 dex for Ne/H, 0.16 dex for S/H,
0.11 dex for Ar/H, and 0.14 dex for Cl/H. These uncertain-
ties are plotted with dashed lines in the ﬁgure. The uncer-
tainties are clearly non-negligible and higher than those re-
ported by many authors. Besides, several spectra introduce
diﬀerences that reach or surpass factors of 2–4 in some of
the abundance ratios.

Figure 10. Distribution of the ﬁnal scores assigned to the spec-
tra. The maximum scores attained by the spectra of each object,
which are used to identify its reference spectra, are also identiﬁed.

The distribution of ﬁnal scores for the 179 spectra ana-
lyzed here is shown in Fig. 10. The ﬁgure also shows the
distribution of maximum scores obtained for the spectra
of each object, which are in the range 68–99. In all cases
but one, there is one spectrum that can be considered as
the best available spectrum of the PN. The exception is for
NGC 6302, where three of the four available spectra reach
the maximum score for this object, ptot = 80 (Krabbe &
Copetti 2006; Rauber et al. 2014; Tsamis et al. 2003). Three
spectra with a ﬁnal score of 80 might seem a pretty good
result at ﬁrst sight, suggesting that we can obtain good es-
timates of the ﬁnal abundances in this PN by averaging the
results of these three spectra, but a comparison of the ﬁ-
nal abundances implied by these spectra suggests otherwise.
The maximum diﬀerences in the total abundances implied
by these three spectra reach 0.11 dex for O/H and are in
the range 0.16–0.25 dex for Cl/H, N/H, Ne/H, and S/H. As
a matter of fact, the three spectra show extreme behaviour
in some of the quality criteria explored above: the spectrum
of Rauber et al. (2014) has log(O+
) = 0.32, whereas the
spectra of Krabbe & Copetti (2006) and Tsamis et al. (2003)
have log(He+
) = −0.36 and −0.85, respectively.
Hence, no reference spectrum is deﬁned or used for this PN.
There are other spectra that achieve the maximum score
for their object, with ptot = 72–80, and have similar prob-

0.14 dex for N/H, 0.14 dex for Ne/H, 0.16 dex for S/H, 0.11 dex for Ar/H, and 0.14 dex for Cl/H.

He/H (cid:39) He+/H++ He++/H+ is lower than 0.18 dex,
and the one-σ diﬀerence is equal to 0.05 dex. Part of these
diﬀerences can be due to real variations in the ionization
state of helium for the diﬀerent areas of each PN sampled by
diﬀerent observations. Because of that, 0.05 dex should be
considered an upper limit to the observational uncertainty
in He/H. Something similar could be happening with the
other elements if the ionization correction factors introduce
biases that depend on the degree of ionization. However,
since the abundance diﬀerences of the other elements
decrease for spectra with higher scores, as shown in Fig. 12,
this is likely to be a minor eﬀect.

A similar analysis can be performed for the abundances
relative to oxygen, which leads to the following observational
one-σ uncertainties: 0.17 dex for N/O, 0.09 dex for Ne/O,
0.18 dex for S/O, 0.15 dex for Ar/O, and 0.14 dex for Cl/O.
The behaviour of the spectra which were not observed
with a CCD, which are shown as open circles in Figs. 11 and

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2020)

12, seems to be broadly consistent with the scores assigned
to these spectra (10 points lower than those given to CCD
spectra), although many of the non-CCD spectra show low
diﬀerences with their reference spectra, suggesting that their
measurements can be quite reliable.

6.10 The best spectra

There are seven spectra that have ﬁnal scores higher than
90: the one observed by Sharpee et al. (2003) for IC 418
and the spectra of Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. (2012) for Cn 1-5,
He 2-86, M 1-25, NGC 6369, PC 14, and Pe 1-1. All of
these are deep, high-spectral resolution spectra that cover
a wide wavelength range, and were obtained with echelle
spectrographs in 4-m and 6.5-m telescopes. Thus, it is not
surprising that these spectra allow the measurement of all
the lines required to achieve a high score.

However, there are other spectra that were observed in

Rodr´ıguez

a similar way and do not get scores higher than 90. As a case
in point, the sample includes three other spectra of Garc´ıa-
Rojas et al. (2012) that have ﬁnal scores lower than 90: those
for Hb 4, M 1-32 and M 3-15. The spectra for Hb 4 (score of
89) and M 1-32 (score of 80) do not include measurements
of all the lines required to achieve the highest scores, but
the M 3-15 spectrum, with a score of 80, does. In this case,
the relatively low score is mainly due to problems with the
relative intensities of the H i lines at λ < 4400 ˚A. Below
this wavelength, the He i and H i start to depart from their
expected values. This only aﬀects slightly the He i lines at
4026 and 4388 ˚A, but the bluest H i lines are seriously af-
fected and the spectrum gets a score of zero (out of 15) in
the part based on the behaviour of the H i lines. This suggest
that there might be a problem with the ﬂux calibration at
the blue end of the spectrum. However, this spectrum was
ﬂux calibrated in the same way as the one observed by the
same authors for Cn 1-5 (Garc´ıa-Rojas, private communica-
tion), which, with a score of 97, is one of the best spectra in
the sample. Besides, both objects were observed at very low
airmasses. This illustrates how easily observational errors of
uncertain origin can creep into our results.

On the other hand, there are many spectra that do not
include measurements of all the lines required to obtain a
high score in the procedure outlined above, but that are
good enough to derive reliable chemical abundances. In those
cases where the reference spectrum of each object provides
reliable chemical abundances, these spectra can be identi-
ﬁed by comparing their abundances to those derived from
the reference spectrum. For each object, I have compared
the abundances of O/H, N/H, and S/H, derived with either
the blue or red [O ii] lines, with those obtained with the
reference spectrum. The O/H abundance ratio is chosen be-
cause it is generally used as a measure of the metallicity of
PNe; N/H and S/H because these ratios are very sensitive to
observational errors, as shown above, and can be estimated
in most objects. A total of 23 spectra lead to O/H, N/H,
and S/H abundance ratios that are within ±0.1 dex of those
derived using the blue [O ii] lines in the corresponding ref-
erence spectrum. These spectra are identiﬁed with a ‘†’ in
Tables B1 to B5. In the case of the red [O ii] lines, there are
17 spectra whose abundance ratios are within ±0.1 dex of
the reference ones. These spectra are identiﬁed with a ‘‡’ in
Tables B1 to B5. There are spectra in common in the two
samples, with 11 spectra that show agreement with the ref-
erence abundances derived using either the blue or red [O ii]
lines. The scores of all these spectra span the full range cov-
ered by non-reference spectra, reaching values as low as 43.
Note that the 20 PNe where two or more spectra lead to
abundances very similar to those of the reference spectrum
can be considered the ones where the derived chemical abun-
dances are more reliable.

7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A set of 179 optical spectra of 42 Galactic PNe compiled
from the literature has been used to explore the eﬀects of
observational uncertainties on the physical conditions and
chemical abundances derived for these objects.

The results based on the [O ii] and [N ii] lines have been
corrected by the eﬀects of recombination on the line inten-

sities by including the eﬀective recombination coeﬃcients
in the statistical equilibrium equations solved for these ions.
Previous approaches to this problem considered the eﬀects of
recombination and collisional excitations separately and do
not lead to the same results. The recombination corrections
start to be important at O++/O+ > 30 and aﬀect mainly the
ﬁnal abundances of N, S, and Cl (see Figs. 1 and 2).

The O+ abundances derived with the red [O ii] lines at
λ ∼ 7325 ˚A are found to be higher than those obtained with
the blue lines at λ ∼ 3727 ˚A. The most likely explanation
of this result is that it is related to the density structure
of these objects or to the choice of atomic data involved in
the calculation of this parameter. However, the relative O+
abundances implied by the red and blue [O ii] lines show a
large dispersion that cannot be explained with these consid-
erations (see Fig. 4). The dispersion is larger for spectra of
poor quality, where it can reach discrepancies much larger
than a factor of 2 (see the left panel of Fig. 9). This sug-
gests that the relative intensities of lines that are not close
in wavelength can be highly uncertain. Another implication
is that the total abundances of elements where the ionization
correction factor is based on the O ions can be very diﬀerent
when derived with either the blue or the red lines of [O ii].
This is especially noticeable in the N abundances, where the
diﬀerences are larger than 0.1 dex in most objects, and can
be close to one order of magnitude in some cases (see Fig. 5).
The relative intensities of bright lines that are close
in wavelength can also have important uncertainties, as
illustrated by spread in the values measured for the
[O iii] λ5007/λ4959 and [N ii] λ6584/λ6548 line ratios shown
in Fig. 6.

The He+ abundances implied by lines located at diﬀer-
ent wavelengths can also be used to explore the uncertain-
ties introduced by the ﬂux calibration or related eﬀects (see
Fig. A1). The He+ abundances derived with the He i λ4026
and λ6678 lines suggest that most of the spectra are bluer
that expected (see Fig. 9).

The quality of the spectra has been assessed using sev-
eral criteria: whether the spectrum was obtained with a CCD
or with a detector that could have non-linearity problems;
the number of available electron density and temperature
diagnostics; the departures of the [O iii] λ5007/λ4959 and
[N ii] λ6584/λ6548 intensity ratios from their expected val-
ues; and the behaviour of the He i and H i lines. These crite-
ria have been used to assign a score to each spectrum that
should provide an estimate of its quality.

The assigned scores are in the range 40–99, and the
scores for the reference spectra (the one with the highest
score for each PN) are in the range 68–99. The diﬀerences in
abundances found for spectra having diﬀerent scores suggest
that reference spectra should ideally have scores higher than
80.

The spectrum with the highest score for each object has
been used as a reference for the results, and the observational
uncertainties aﬀecting the total abundances have been esti-
mated from the diﬀerences between the results obtained with
diﬀerent spectra and those implied by the reference spec-
trum. The derived one-σ observational uncertainties are the
following: 0.11 dex for O/H, 0.14 dex for N/H, 0.14 dex for
Ne/H, 0.16 dex for S/H, 0.11 dex for Ar/H, and 0.14 dex for
Cl/H. In the case of He/H, the one-σ observational uncer-
tainty should be lower than 0.05 dex.

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2020)

These PNe can be considered the most easily observed
PNe, since each of them has at least three available spectra
with a minimum quality. The observational uncertainties af-
fecting other objects might be larger.

In 20 of the 42 PNe in the sample, there is at least
one additional spectrum that implies chemical abundances
that diﬀer in less than 0.1 dex from those derived with the
reference spectrum. These 20 PNe are the ones with the
more reliable chemical abundances.

Finally, many of the results found here should apply to
spectra obtained in a similar way for objects other than PNe.
In particular, the spectra of H ii regions should be similarly
aﬀected.

† O/H, N/H, and S/H are within 0.1 dex of the reference spectrum for calculations based on the blue [O ii] lines.
‡ O/H, N/H, and S/H are within 0.1 dex of the reference spectrum for calculations based on the red [O ii] lines.
NOTE. In those cases where line intensities were presented for more than one region in the PN, the position with the largest number of
measured lines was selected.
