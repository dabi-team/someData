Lie symmetries are applied to classify the source of the magnetic ﬁeld for the Pulsar equation near
to the surface of the neutron star. We ﬁnd that there are six possible diﬀerent admitted Lie algebras.
We apply the corresponding Lie invariants to reduce the Pulsar equation close to the surface to an
ordinary diﬀerential equation. This equation is solved either with the use of Lie symmetries or the
application of the ARS algorithm for singularity analysis to write the analytic solution as a Laurent
expansion. These solutions are called inner solutions.

INTRODUCTION

Pulsars are one of the most impressive observable celestial objects in the sky. They are assumed to be rotating
neutron stars which emit radio signals. However, their importance follows from the fact that they are physical
laboratories which provide extreme conditions of strong magnetic ﬁelds which cannot be reproduced on Earth.

The structure of the strong magnetic ﬁelds in a Pulsar is described by a scalar function which satisﬁes the elliptic

second-order partial diﬀerential equation [1, 2],

1 − x2
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(Ψ,xx + Ψ,zz) −

1 + x2

Ψ,x + F (Ψ) = 0,

(1)

where the singularities at x = 0 and x = 1 represent the centre of the star, (x is the radius coordinate) and the surface
of the pulsar is located at x = 1. Function F (Ψ) is related to the proﬁle of the magnetic ﬁeld for the polar coordinate
[1]. Equation (1) is also known as the relativistic force-free Grad-Shafranov equation [3].

In order to arrive at such a simple scalar equation, (1), for the magnetic ﬁeld, various Ans¨atze have been assumed
for the physical state of the star. In particular it has been assumed that [1]: (a) the system is axisymmetric and time-
independent; (b) the electrons and the ions have a well-deﬁned velocity and density; (c) there are no gravitational or
particle collision eﬀects; (d) inertial forces have been considered and (e) it is assumed that the surface of the uniformly
rotating star is a perfect conductor.

Because of the nonlinearity and the existence of the two singular points, the Pulsar equation, (1), cannot be
integrated in general and only few solutions are known in the literature. Originally, an asymptotic analytical solution
which describes the magnetic ﬁeld near to the surface of the star was presented by Michel in [2]. This was also the
main inspiration for the recent works of Uzdensky [4] and Gruzinov [5]. In [4] an interesting discussion of the physical
state of the boundary conditions is given. However, numerical solutions which describe the global evolution of the
Pulsar equation have been presented in the literature. One of the ﬁrst numerical force-free solutions was derived by
Contopoulos et al. [6], while other numerical solutions can be found in [7–10] and references therein.

In this work we are interested to apply the powerful method of Lie symmetries [11, 12] in order to study the
existence of invariant solutions for the Pulsar equation near to the singularity, x = 1, and to ﬁnd analytical asymptotic
solutions, the so-called similarity solutions. In particular, we classify the source of the magnetic ﬁeld, i.e. function
F (Ψ), such that the Pulsar equation, near to the singularity, x = 1, be invariant under the action of one-parameter
point transformations. This kind of classiﬁcation was ﬁrstly introduced by Ovsiannikov [13] and has been applied
to various physical systems for the determination of new analytical solutions, for instance see [14–27] and references
therein, for various applications of the Lie symmetry classiﬁcation in Physics.

The novelty of Lie symmetries is that symmetries can be used to deﬁne invariant surfaces and to reduce the number
of dependent variables – for partial diﬀerential equations – or to reduce the order of the diﬀerential equation for
ordinary diﬀerential equations. Hence new integrable systems can be constructed and new analytical solution to be
determined. The plan of the paper follows.

In Section 2 the basic properties and deﬁnitions for the Lie (point) symmetries of diﬀerential equations are presented.
In the same Section we perform the classiﬁcation of the Lie symmetries of the pulsar equation near to the surface
of the star and we ﬁnd that there are six diﬀerent admitted groups of point-transformations which leave the pulsar
equation invariant for six diﬀerent functional form of the source, F (Ψ). The context of singularity analysis is discussed
which is used in subsequent Sections to prove the integrability of some of the reduced diﬀerential equations. The
application of the Lie symmetries and the determination of the similarity inner solutions is performed in Section 3.
New asymptotic analytic solutions near to the surface of the star are presented. Finally in Section 4 we discuss our
results and we draw our conclusions.

2. LIE SYMMETRY ANALYSIS

For the convenience of the reader we present the basic properties and deﬁnitions of Lie point symmetries of
diﬀerential equations and more speciﬁcally we discuss the case of second-order diﬀerential equations of the form
A ≡A
= 0, where xk are the independent variables and Ψ is the dependent variable with ﬁrst

∂xi = Ψ,i.

The novelty of Lie symmetries is that they can be used to determine similarity transformations, i.e. diﬀerential
transformations where the number of independent variables is reduced [12]. The similarity transformation is calculated
with the use of the associated Lagrange’s system,

(7)

Solutions of partial diﬀerential equations which are derived with the application of Lie invariants are called similarity
solutions. In this speciﬁc work we use the Lie symmetries to reduce the Pulsar equation to a second-order diﬀerential
equation. For this equation we shall analytic solutions by using the symmetry approach and, if we fail, we apply the
singularity analysis.

2.1. Singularity analysis

Singularity analysis is another powerful mathematical method which is applied to study the integrability of diﬀer-
ential equations and to present the solutions of diﬀerential equations in algebraic form, in particular by using Laurent
expansions around a movable singularity.

Singularity analysis is also known as the Painlev´e Test [28–31] and has been applied in various problems for the

study of integrability of given diﬀerential equations.

Ablowiz, Ramani and Segur [32–34] systematized the Painlev´e Test in a simple algorithm, also known as the ARS
algorithm. The main feature of the ARS algorithm is its simplicity. It consists of three main algebraic stems: (a)
determination of leading-order behaviour; (b) determination of resonances and (c) consistency of Laurent expansion.
For every step of the algorithm there are various criteria which should be applied, these criteria are summarized in
the review of Ramani et al. [35].

3

If a given diﬀerential equation passes the three steps of the ARS algorithm, then we conclude that the given diﬀer-
ential equation is algebraically integrable. However, should the diﬀerential equation fail the ARS algorithm, we cannot
make a conclusion about the integrability of the diﬀerential equation. While the ARS algorithm is straightforward on
its application, one of the main disadvantages is that it depends upon the coordinates in which the given equation is
deﬁned, for a recent discussion we refer the reader to [36].

2.2. Pulsar equation near to the singularity

We deﬁne the new coordinate, y = x − 1, in order to move the surface of the star to y = 0. It follow, y > 0, when

x > 1 and y < 0 , when x < 1. In the new coordinates the Pulsar equation (1) becomes

y (2 + y) (Ψ,yy + Ψ,zz) +

2 + 2y + y2
(cid:0)
1 + y

(cid:1)

Ψ,y − F (Ψ) = 0.

Near to the surface with y ≃ 0, (8) is approximated by the simpler form [2]

2y (Ψ,yy + Ψ,zz) + 2Ψ,y − F (Ψ) = 0.

(8)

(9)

This is the equation which Michel [2] used to ﬁnd the ﬁrst analytical expression for the force-free magnetosphere and
inspired the later works of [4, 5]. Equation (9) is the one that we use to perform the symmetry classiﬁcation.

Moreover, we follow [4, 5] and we work on the polar-like coordinates

where equation (9) takes the form

y = r sin θ , z = r cos θ,

2r sin θ

2 sin θ +

(cid:18)

cos θ

r (cid:19)

Ψ,r − F (Ψ) = 0.

(10)

(11)

Hence the surface is indicated when r = 0 or θ = 0. We continue with the classiﬁcation of the sources, F (Ψ), such
that equation (11) be invariant under one-parameter point transformations, i.e. Lie symmetries exist, while in the
following section we discuss the application of the Lie symmetries by performing reduction of the equation with the
use of the Lie invariants.

2.3. Symmetry classiﬁcation

For the second-order diﬀerential equation (11) the symmetry condition (5) provides that for arbitrary function,

FA (Ψ) = F (Ψ), the diﬀerential equation admit the unique symmetry vector

Y = cos θ∂r −

sin θ
r

∂θ.

That vector ﬁeld corresponds to the translation symmetry, ∂z, in the original coordinates, for equation (8) which
is also a symmetry of equation (1). Reduction with the use of the symmetry vector Y leads to solutions which are
independent of the z−direction and are not of special interest.

However, for speciﬁc functions, F (Ψ), the diﬀerential equation (11) can be invariant under a higher dimensional

Lie algebra. In particular we ﬁnd ﬁve diﬀerent cases:

• When the source is constant, i.e. FB (Ψ) = F0, the diﬀerential equation (11) admits four plus inﬁnity symmetries,

these are.

X1 = ∂r , X2 = Y , X3 = r2 cos θ∂r + r sin θ∂x − r cos θ Ψ∂Ψ

where b (r, θ) is a solution of equation (11). The last two symmetries, i.e. X4 and X∞, denote the linearity of
equation (11). The Lie Brackets of the admitted algebra are given in Table I

X4 = Ψ∂Ψ , X∞ = b (r, θ) ∂Ψ,

(12)

• For linear source, FC (Ψ) = F1Ψ, the diﬀerential equation admits two plus inﬁnity symmetries, those

are X2 , X4 and X∞.

• Moreover, for the power-law source, FF (Ψ) = F1Ψ

admits two Lie point symmetries, these are

under a three-dimensional Lie algebra with elements the vector ﬁelds X2, X(1/2), X3, and Lie Brackets as are
presented in Table II.

We continue with the application of the Lie symmetry vectors to determine analytical solutions of the Pulsar
equation (11). The solutions that we determine are valid as ﬁrst approximations of the general solution near to the
surface of the star. In particular, near to the surface of the star, y ≃ 0, the diﬀerential equation can be seen as a
singular pertubative equation and the theory of singular perturbative diﬀerential equations [37, 38] can be applied in
order to justify the approximation of the analytical solution. The solutions near to the point y ≃ 0 are called inner
solutions [37].

3. SIMILARITY SOLUTIONS

As we discussed in the previous Section, for every Lie symmetry we can deﬁne a surface where the solution is

independent of one of the variables, that is, deﬁne similarity variables.

For arbitrary source, F (Ψ), from the vector ﬁeld ∂z the invariant solution is the one where Ψ (y, z) = Ψ (y) and

the resulting diﬀerential equation is the ordinary diﬀerential equation

That is not a solution of special interest. Hence we proceed with our analysis by using the remainder of the symmetry
vectors.

2yΨ,yy + 2Ψ,y − F (Ψ) = 0.

(14)

3.1.

Invariant solutions for constant source

The case of constant source also covers the free-source problem when F0 = 0. Indeed in equation (9) for F (Ψ) = F0
we can replace Ψ → Ψ + F0
2 y. Then the source-free case follows. From table I it follows that there are four possible
reductions which we can perform. They are: (a) reduction with the symmetry vector X1 + µX4; (b) reduction with
X2 + µX4; (c) reduction with X3 + µX4; and (d) reduction with X3 + µX2. For each of these reductions the reduced
equation is a linear second-order diﬀerential equation which can be integrated easily.

The ﬁrst possible reduction of the source-free Pulsar equation (11) provides the solution to be

3.1.1. Reduction with X1 + µX4

Ψ1 (r, θ) = rµΣ (θ) ,

where Σ (θ) satisﬁes the ordinary diﬀerential equation

the closed-form solution of which is given in terms of the Legendre functions as

Σ,θθ + cot θ Σ,θ + µ (µ + 1) Σ = 0

Σ (θ) = σ1Pµ (cos θ) + σ2Qµ (cos θ)

in which Pµ (θ) , Qµ (θ) denote the Legendre functions.

For special values of the parameter µ the solution (17) can be simpliﬁed as follows

Σ (θ) = σ1 + σ2 ln

(19)

It is important to mention that in general the parameter, µ, can be any complex number and, when it is imaginary,

solution (15) becomes periodic as follows Ψ (r, θ) = exp (i|µ| ln r) Σ (θ) .

Solution (15) is well-known in the literature and was derived by Michel in [2]. In particular for µ = 1

2 solution (15)
provides a magnetic ﬁeld which diverges as the inverse square root of r such that the total energy of the magnetic
ﬁeld remains ﬁnite at the surface of the star, i.e. when y = 0. That is a physical condition which imposes a boundary
condition and restricts the free parameters of the solution.

The analytical solutions which are presented in the following Sections are new in the literature, but, as we see, they

do not provide explicitly any law of the form Ψ ≃ r

Consider now reduction with the Lie symmetry vector, X2 + µX4. The invariant solution is calculated in Cartesian

in which Jm (y) , Ym (y) denote the Bessel functions of the ﬁrst and second kind, respectively.

The source-free equation, (11), is linear, a property that follows also from the existence of the symmetry vectors X4
and X∞. Hence the general solution can be written as a sum of the speciﬁc invariant solutions Ψ1, Ψ2, Ψ3 and Ψ4
calculated above, over all the possible values of the free parameters µ for each solution. However, the general solution
is restricted only when initial/boundary conditions are applied in the problem.

(cid:1)

In the following lines, the reduction process is applied for the remainder of the cases provided by the Lie symmetry

classiﬁcation.

3.2.

Invariant solutions for linear source

For the linear source, FC (Ψ) = F1Ψ, it is possible to perform only one reduction with the symmetry vector

X2 + µX4. The invariant solution is calculated in Cartesian coordinates to be

Ψ (y, z) = eµz (Ψ1Ma,0 (2iµy) + Ψ2Wa,0 (2iµy)) ,

(27)

where α = iF1

4µ ; and Ma,b, Wa,b are Whittaker functions.

3.3.

Invariant solutions for power-law source

For the power-law source, FD (Ψ) = F1Ψ

N +1 , we perform reduction by using the Lie symmetry vector X(N ). The

reduced equation is calculated to be

2N (N − 1) sin θ − F1Σ

(cid:16)

Σ = 0

1
N

(cid:17)

while the solution of the Pulsar equation, (11), is expressed as

Ψ (r, θ) = r−N Σ (θ) .

(28)

(29)

The reduced equation, (28), has been derived before in [4, 5] and actually the power-law source can describe the
magnetic ﬁeld of the Pulsar after the surface boundary. More speciﬁcally, in [5] it was assumed that, when the
source-free axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere closes, there exists a boundary condition in order for the solution of
the power-law source to continue to describe the magnetic ﬁeld. Hence with that assumption it was found that the
value of N is approximately N ≃ −2.4, such that Ψ ≃ r2.4 [5].

It is interesting to comment here that solutions (15) and (29) were derived before without any knowledge of
the symmetries of the diﬀerential equation (11). Moreover, those speciﬁc invariant solutions satisfy the boundary
conditions imposed by the physics of the neutron star.

On the other hand, in the coordinates {y, z}, the reduced solution can be written equivalently as Ψ (y, z) =

y−N Λ (σ), where θ = arcsin σ, and Λ (σ) now satisﬁes the equation

This nonlinear equation does not admit any Lie symmetry and for that we apply the singularity analysis to study the
integrability and write the analytical solution.

Equation (30) is a nonautonomous equation. With the new change of variables, σ = Y (s), Λ (σ) = Y,s (s) , we
increase the order of the diﬀerential equation, but the new equation is autonomous. We apply the steps of the ARS
algorithm.

Hence once expects one of the resonances to be zero.

As far as concerns the resonances they are calculated to be

q1 = −1 , q2 = 0 , q3 =

(31)

which means that the diﬀerential equation passes the singularity test and the analytical solutions is expressed by a
Right Painlev´e series for N ∈ (−∞, −1) ∪

with step which depends on the value N .

In order to perform the consistency test, we select N = 2 which means that the third resonance is q3 = 1. Hence

The three integration constants are: the position of the singularity and the coeﬃcients Y0 and Y2. The rest of the

coeﬃcients YJ are functions of Y0, Y2. Hence, equation (28) is integrable though the singularity analysis.

However, there exists also a second leading-order behaviour, which is YB (s) = Y0s

all the values of N , such that N 6= 2. The resonances are calculated to be

Invariant solutions for the cubic source

When the power-law source has a cubic law, that is, FE (Ψ) = F1Ψ3, then from the symmetry classiﬁcation we saw
that the Pulsar equation admits an extra Lie symmetry vector ﬁeld. The reduction with the vector ﬁeld X3, provides
the invariant solution

where now w (α) satisﬁes the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation

(2 + α) w,α − w − F0α3 = 0,

(37)

which is an Abel’s equation of the second kind.

The solution of this Abel’s equation cannot be written in a closed-form. However, diﬀerential equation (35) can
be solved with the singularity analysis and the generic solution is given in algebraic form. Hence we apply the ARS
algorithm. by ﬁrstly making the equation an autonomous third-order equation with the transformation ξ = Y (s) and
Σ (ξ) = Y (s),s . Equation (35) is written as

Y Y,sY,sss − 2Y (Y,ss)2 + (Y,s)2 Y,ss − F1 (Y,s)6 = 0.

(38)

For this equation we perform the new change of coordinates Y (s) = 1

Z(s) , where we ﬁnd that the leading-order

behaviours are Z (s) = Z0sp, with p1 = −1 and p2 = −2. In both cases, Z0 is an arbitrary constant.

For p1 the ARS algorithm provides the resonances

q1 = −1 , q2 = 0 , q3 =

which means that the the general solution is given by a Right Painlev´e expansion with step 1

singularity. Finally the consistency test provides that Z1 = 0, Z2 = − F1

etc.

As far as concerns the second leading-order behaviour, p2, we ﬁnd that the resonances are

¯q1 = −1 , ¯q2 = −2 , ¯q3 = −4

(41)

and, while once expects one of the resonances to be zero, because Z0 is arbitrary, that is not true. Hence the ARS
algorithm for the leading-order term p2 fails and solution (40) is the only solution which can be constructed by the
ARS algorithm.

In Fig. 1 the density plot of the invariant solution (34) is given in space of variables {y, z}.
For completeness we mention that reduction with the symmetry vector X(1/2) provides the same solution as that

of the power-law source FD (Ψ) for N = 1

Finally for the power-law source, FF (Ψ) = F1e− 1

C Ψ, we apply the invariants of the Lie symmetry vector ﬁeld ¯X(C),

which provide us with the invariant solution

where Σ (θ), satisﬁes the nonlinear second-order diﬀerential equation

Ψ (r, θ) = ln r−C + Σ (θ) ,

2 sin θ Σ,θθ + 2 cos θ Σ,θ − F1e− 1

C Σ − 2C sin θ = 0.

As before we prefer to work with the coordinates {y, z} and write the invariant solution as

Ψ (y, z) = ln yC + Λ (σ) , with θ = arcsin σ,

in which function Λ (σ) satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation

Equation (45) has no symmetries and in order to prove the integrability we apply the ARS algorithm. Indeed, under

Finally we apply the consistency test of the ARS algorithm for various values of the parameter C, and we infer that
for C 6= −1 the diﬀerential equation (45) passes the singularity test and its solution can be expressed in terms of a
Laurent expansion.

In Fig. 2 the density plot of the invariant solution (34) is given in space of variables {y, z}.

4. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we applied two powerful mathematical methods in order to determine analytical solutions for the Pulsar
equation near to the surface of the neutron star. More speciﬁcally we applied the Lie symmetry analysis to classify
the form of the source for the magnetic ﬁeld in the Pulsar equation such that the resulting equation admit Lie (point)

symmetries, that is, be invariant under the action of one-parameter point transformations. From the classiﬁcation
process, we found that the (inner) Pulsar equation can be invariant under the action of six diﬀerent Lie algebras.

For each of the vector ﬁelds followed by the classiﬁcation scheme we used the (zeroth-order) Lie invariants to reduce
the number of the independent variables for the diﬀerential equation and write it as an ordinary diﬀerential equation.
That equation could be solved in all the cases with the use of symmetries or with the application of the ARS algorithm.
In particular the ARS algorithm was applied to prove the integrability for some of the reduced equations and write
the analytical solution in a form of Laurent expansion.

The solutions that we derived are asymptotic solutions of the Pulsar equation (1) near to the surface of the neutron
star. Only two of the solutions were derived before in the literature and these Lie invariant solutions provide a ﬁnite
magnetic ﬁeld in the surface of the neutron star. The new asymptotic solutions can be used as toy-models for the
viability of numerical approximations for the elliptic equation (1)

In a forthcoming work we wish to study the boundary conditions which should be satisﬁed in order that the new
Lie invariant solutions be solutions of the complete problem. Finally the physical implications of those solutions is a
subject for a future study.
