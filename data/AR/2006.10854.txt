Abstract

Angle resolved-Auger-photoelectron coincidence spectroscopy (AR-APECS) has

been exploited to investigate the role that electron correlation plays in the

exchange-coupling at the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interface of a Fe/CoO

bilayer grown on Ag(001). The eﬀective correlation energy Ueﬀ, usually em-

ployed to assess the energy distribution of core-valence-valence Auger spectra,

has been experimentally determined for each possible combination of the or-

bital (eg or t2g) and the spin (majority or minority) of the two valence electrons

involved in the Auger decay. Coulomb and exchange interactions have been

identiﬁed and compared with the result obtained on the Fe/Ag system. The pre-

sented analysis reveals in the Fe/CoO interface an enhancement of the Coulomb

interaction for the eg orbital and of the exchange interaction for the t2g orbital

with respect to the Fe/Ag case, that can be associated to the stronger electron

1. Introduction

Developing new kind of magnetic composite devices requires crucial advance-

ments in the comprehension, at the atomic level, of the physics of processes

determining interface phenomena, such as those occurring at the ferromagnetic

(FM) / antiferromagnetic (AFM) interface. Interface coupling between diﬀerent

magnetic phases plays a role in the behavior of most of the current magnetic and

spintronic devices such as tunnel magnetoresistance read heads [1], magnetore-

sistive sensor recording media [2] or magnetoresistive random access memories

(MRAMs) [3], to name a few.

By coupling a FM with an AFM the interaction between the two magnetic

phases gives rise to interesting eﬀects, among which the so-called exchange bias

(see Nogues et al. for a review [4]), that amounts to a modiﬁcation of the mag-

netization curve of the FM operated by the pinning of the AFM spins. The role

that electron correlation plays in this eﬀect is still debated [5, 6, 7, 8]. In general,

a detailed understanding of the interplay among band structure, magnetism, and

many-body correlations is still in progress [9] and needs to be established on

ﬁrm grounds. Among the possible FM/AFM bilayers relevant to applications,

3d-FM transition metals (TMs) coupled to their AFM oxides (TMOs) play a

pivotal role as they allow to achieve a very good control on the growth process

and consequently on their electronic and magnetic structure. For these rea-

sons, Fe/TMO bilayers are archetype for investigating FM/AFM interfaces and

have been extensively studied over the years [10]. Recently, nuclear resonant

scattering [11, 1], magneto optical Kerr eﬀect [13, 2, 15] or X-ray absorption

measurements [2, 15, 16], have reported complex interfacial properties. The

results obtained in refs. [11, 1, 3] point to the presence of an oxide phase of the

2

FM layer in the interface region, but the role it plays in the magnetic interac-

tion has not been established yet. In such systems, it is particularly important

to study the local magnetic conﬁguration of the few atomic layers forming the

interface at the early stage of formation of the bilayer. Hence, an ultra thin

Fe layer grown on top of a metal oxide is a good test bed to investigate eﬀects

induced by the substrate on the ferromagnetic overlayer.

Exploiting the information potential of such a system is experimentally chal-

lenging because it requires tools featuring atomic scale sensitivity to electron

correlation combined with elemental selectivity. Not many conventional spectro-

scopies satisfy both conditions; among them Auger spectroscopy is particularly

sensitive to electron correlation but its application to FM/AFM interfaces has

a drawback: spectra originated by the metals in FM and AFM phases show

broad and almost featureless lineshapes that often overlap in energy. Auger

photoelectron coincidence spectroscopy (APECS) [18] has proven to overcome

this diﬃculty and to be suitable to investigate in a unique way the Auger line-

shape of complex and highly correlated systems [19, 20]. These experiments

detect, correlated in time, the photo- and the Auger-electron ejected within

the same photoionization event, thus yielding spectra that are made local by

the core photoemission and sensitive to electron correlation in the valence band

by the Auger decay whose ﬁnal state features at least two interacting holes.

Furthermore, when the emission angle of the two electrons is taken into ac-

count, APECS becomes sensitive to the total spin of the two-hole ﬁnal state

[17, 22]. With the discovery of the dichroic eﬀects in angle resolved APECS

(DEAR-APECS), it has been possible to isolate, in the Auger spectrum of FM

and AFM thin ﬁlms, the individual contributions of speciﬁc hole-hole pairing

originating from spin polarized bands, allowing a deeper insight into the local

magnetic structure of these systems [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].

It is the aim of this paper to apply AR-APECS to unravel the role of electron

correlation in the exchange-coupling at FM/AFM bilayers. In order to establish

possible connections between correlation and exchange-coupling, the results ob-

tained for the interface where such an eﬀect is observed, i.e. Fe/CoO [16], are

3

compared with results obtained for a system where it is not present, i.e. Fe/Ag,

which is assumed as a reference [28]. The paper is organized as follows: section

2 introduces the experimental methods, the experimental results are presented

and discussed in section 3 and section 4 is devoted to the conclusions.

2. Experimental

The experiments were carried out with the AR-APECS apparatus at the

ALOISA beamline of the ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility (Basovizza -

Trieste, Italy) [29]. An iron thin ﬁlm was deposited on a CoO thicker ﬁlm grown

on an Ag(001) crystal surface. The non-magnetic Ag substrate was chosen be-

cause of its reduced lattice mismatch with respect to both Fe and CoO, thus

allowing a good pseudomorphic growth of these overlayers. Cycles of 1 KeV

Ar+-ion sputtering have been performed to clean the Ag(001) single crystal

surface, that resulted free of contaminants at an X-ray photoemission analysis.

The Ag surface was then annealed at 750 K to achieve good crystallographic

order. The CoO conventional cell (face-centered cubic - fcc - rock salt struc-
ture, aCoO = 4.26 ˚A) grows almost in register with the Ag crystal structure
(fcc, aAg = 4.09 ˚A) and an initial compressive strain gives way to a relaxed ﬁlm
after few monolayers (MLs) [30, 31]. The CoO ﬁlm was obtained by reactive

deposition of Co atoms, evaporated on the Ag (001) substrate by electron bom-

bardment of a high purity metal rod in a controlled atmosphere with an oxygen

partial pressure of 1·10−4 Pa. In order to avoid the formation of clusters with

diﬀerent crystallographic orientations [16], the Ag substrate was kept at 470

K during deposition and a 30 minutes post-annealing at 750 K was performed

in the same oxygen atmosphere. Crystallinity of the overlayer was checked by

means of reﬂection high energy electron diﬀraction (RHEED), that displayed

the same (001) periodicity of the substrate. Photoemission spectra of the CoO

ﬁlm resulted free from contaminants. The same photoemission measurements

were used to evaluate the CoO ﬁlm thickness by comparing peak intensity of

Ag and Co core states, thus calibrating the deposition rate [32, 33]. A 25 ML-

4

thick CoO ﬁlm was employed for the subsequent growth of the Fe epilayer. A 2

ML-thick Fe ﬁlm was epitaxially grown on top of the CoO overlayer, by electron

bombardment of a high purity metal rod. The surface quality was monitored by

RHEED, photoemission spectroscopy and the X-ray absorption at the Fe L23

edge. The Fe thickness was estimated by using evaporation conditions (time and

rate) identical to those used to achieve two complete RHEED oscillations [32]

in a previous experiment performed on Fe/Ag(001) with the same experimental

setup [28].

The Fe ﬁlm grows epitaxially on the CoO substrates with the conventional
crystalline cell (body-centered cubic - bcc - aFe = 2.87 ˚A) rotated by 45◦ with
respect to the cells of underlying CoO and Ag [16, 34, 35]. In Fig. 1 a model of

the Fe/CoO interface shows that the diagonal of the rotated Fe unit cell matches

the edges of the CoO unit cell, in accordance with the simple model presented

by Brambilla et al. [34]. In the ﬁgure the four atoms deﬁning the lower face of

the Fe cell sit on top of the underlying O ions. Even though a bond between Fe

atoms and O ions of the CoO ﬁlm is expected, real interfaces between Fe and

simple oxides can be more complex and the formation of iron oxides has been

demonstrated both by experiment and calculations [2, 3, 4].

A Curie temperature TC well above RT is found in literature for a 2 ML

thick Fe ﬁlms grown on Ag (001) [37, 38, 39]. The N´eel temperature (TN ) of

the 25 ML-thick CoO ﬁlm equals the bulk one, i.e. TN = 290 K [16]. During all

measurements, the sample temperature has been kept constant at 170 K, well

below the critical temperatures of both the FM and AFM phases, assuming for

the Fe layer grown on CoO a TC close to that of the Fe/Ag system with the

same Fe thickness. It is well established that the orientation of the magneti-

zation in thin ﬁlms strongly depends on thickness, temperature and thermal

treatment. Annealed samples usually display a reorientation of the magnetiza-

tion from out-of-plane to in-plane increasing thickness and/or temperature [38].

For non-annealed samples, no out of plane anisotropy is found above 100 K for

thicknesses ranging from 0.8 to 10 ML [39]. However, this experiment relies only

on the quantisation axis identiﬁed by the electric ﬁeld of the impinging linearly

5

polarized light. Therefore, being not necessary to know the sample magneti-

zation M to interpret the experimental result, no external magnetic ﬁeld was

applied to the investigated samples before or during the measurements.

The AR-APECS apparatus employed in this work, is discussed in detail else-

where [29], except for the energy-multichannel electron analyzer that replaced

two of the seven energy-single-channel analyzers, previously used. Schemati-

cally, the experimental apparatus consists of six electron energy-analyzers mounted

on two diﬀerent frames: ﬁve single-channel, with optical axes lying in the plane

deﬁned by the momentum K and the linear polarization (cid:15) of the photon beam,

and one multichannel positioned 38◦ away from such a plane (see Fig. 2). A pho-

ton beam set to hν = 250 eV impinged onto the sample surface in p-polarization

and at grazing incidence, the surface normal being 6◦ away from (cid:15).

In the

experiment, Fe 3p photoelectrons were collected in the (cid:15)K plane by the ﬁve

single-channel analyzers (Ani in Fig. 2); each of them encompassed a diﬀerent

polar angle with respect to (cid:15) i.e. 0◦, ±18◦ and ±36◦, thus deﬁning diﬀerent AR-

APECS kinematics. The energy resolution of these ﬁve analyzers was set to 3.2

eV and the accepted energy window was detuned 1.5 eV towards kinetic ener-

gies higher than the 3p photoelectron peak maximum, in order to collect mainly

the three photoemission lines closely packed at the high kinetic energy side of

the 3p photoemission sextet [40, 41].

In doing this, the signal from oxidized

iron, which contributes with a component chemically shifted 1.9 eV at lower

(higher) kinetic (binding) energy [42, 43], is lowered as explained as follows.

The quantitative eﬀect of such a setting is explained in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3a, the

Fe 3p high resolution (0.2 eV) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spec-

trum of the Fe/CoO interface is compared with the one measured for the Fe/Ag

interface [28], after alignment and normalization to their maximum intensity;

their diﬀerence, shown by the black continuous line and which is interpreted as

an evidence for the formation of iron-oxygen bonds at the Fe/CoO interface,

provides an estimate of the contribution to the Fe 3p peak intensity due to iron

atoms bonded to oxygen, which results less than 10% of the contribution ascrib-

able to metal atoms. In Fig. 3b, the Fe 3p peak measured with 3.2 eV energy

6

resolution, as used in the APECS setting, is shown together with the energy

window accepted by the photoelectron analyzers (3.2 eV FWHM), which is set

1.5 eV above the Fe 3p maximum intensity. Multiplying the energy window by

the two Fe 3p contributions (the metallic one as derived by the Fe/Ag XPS after

background subtraction, and the oxide one derived by the diﬀerence spectrum)

allows to quantify the contribution to the AR-APECS spectra due to oxidized

iron to be less than 5 % or, in other words, the contribution from metallic iron

is dominant in AR-APECS spectra.

Fe M3VV (that is a M3M4,5M4,5 super Coster-Kronig decay) Auger elec-

trons, were collected at an angle of 38◦ oﬀ the (cid:15)K plane by the multichannel

analyzer (B in Fig. 2), set to provide an energy resolution of 1 eV while scanning

the full spectrum. Taking into account the 3p3/2 core-hole lifetime broadening

(Γ = 0.48 eV [44]), and the many-body eﬀects accompanying the Auger tran-

sition [45], a total intrinsic broadening of 1.6 eV FWHM is estimated for the

Auger measurements.

Depending on the diﬀerent collection angles selected by the analyzers, a

moderate selection of partial waves with a speciﬁc m quantum number associ-

ated to the two emitted electrons, is achieved. These are spherical harmonics

deﬁned with respect to (cid:15) whose amplitude is modulated by diﬀraction from the

crystal lattice [22, 23]. Namely, the wavefunction of electrons emitted within

a cone centered around (cid:15) and with an aperture angle of about 20◦ has almost

pure m = 0 character, while electrons emitted outside of this cone, have pre-

dominantly character m = 1 for photoelectrons and m ≥ 1 for Auger electrons

(the higher the deviation angle from (cid:15) the higher the dominant m). The angular

selection operated on the photoelectron implies that only the subset of core-hole

states with the selected magnetic quantum number m are involved in the fol-

lowing step. The detection in time coincidence of the subsequent Auger electron

will select autoionizing events that originate not from a statistical population

of core-hole states, but rather from that speciﬁc subset of them, i.e.

from an

aligned core state. By selecting in angle the Auger electron, a further constraint

on the allowed m for the Auger wave function is imposed. Taking into account

7

the two discriminated m values, and the selection rules for photoemission and

Auger processes, a selectivity on speciﬁc ﬁnal states is established, which has

been extensively discussed in previous works [46, 17, 47]. In short, if the two

electrons are ejected close to the polarization (cid:15), (m = 0 for both) the combina-

tion of the selection rules with the Pauli exclusion principle dictates that the two

electrons are ejected with opposite spin. Therefore, only ﬁnal states associated

to the emission of an electron pair with antiparallel spin can be ascribed to the

observed AR-APECS spectrum. On the contrary, when electron detected far

from the (cid:15) direction are involved, larger values of m are favored, thus allowing

also the emission of two electrons with parallel spin. In general, the relative

weight of antiparallel spin versus parallel spin emission can be expressed as a

function of |∆m| = |m1 − m2|, where m1 and m2 are the m values of the two

emitted electrons; the higher |∆m|, the higher the probability of parallel spin

emission [17]. In this experiment, for Auger electrons emitted 38◦ from the (cid:15)K

plane, a mix of m = 0, 1 and 2 components of the dominant f Auger electron

wavefunction is detected. For the photoelectron collected by the central ana-

lyzer (An3 in Fig. 2) along the polarization vector direction, mostly described

by a d wavefunction, the m = 0 component dominate and relatively low values

of |∆m| are involved. In analogy to previous AR-APECS experiments [24, 28],

the analyzers pairs selecting photoelectrons emitted close to the polarization

vector will be termed as antiparallel spin conﬁguration (AS) , while pairs with

the photoelectron far from (cid:15) will be termed parallel spin conﬁguration (PS).

The coincidence count rate for these experiments was of the order of 8.6 · 10−2

counts per second, thus nearly 65 h of integration time have been required to

achieve a good statistic. Due to the reactivity of the iron surface, sample quality

has been constantly monitored and to prevent oxidation a new sample has been

prepared every 12 h of beam exposure.

3. Results and Discussion

A thorough analysis of the conventional Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)

is reported as supplementary material

[48], together with the implementation

of a Fe-O molecular model [8, 9, 11], used to quantify the eﬀect on the Fe M3VV

lineshape of the iron atoms bonded to the oxygen. The main result are: (i) trying

to infer the M3VV lineshape from conventional AES is an unreliable procedure

that leads to the wrong conclusion that electron correlation is irrelevant and

then the lineshape can be ﬁtted by the self-convolution of the valence band

density of states; (ii) the eﬀect due to a small amount of iron oxide at the

buried interface (less than 5% as probed by XPS) is minimal and negligible in

the APECS spectra, which are in turn more surface sensitive with respect to

non coincident XPS and AES spectra [20].

The angle-resolved AR-APECS measurements are reported for the Fe/CoO

case in Fig. 4a, as measured in the AS and PS conﬁguration, respectively. The

dichroic eﬀect associated to AR-APECS (DEAR-APECS) reported in Fig. 4b,

that is the diﬀerence between the Auger lineshapes collected in PS and AS

conﬁgurations, is more relevant in the lower energy section of the spectrum.

Previous AR-APECS investigations on Fe thin ﬁlms

[26, 28] have associated

features in the low-energy region of the spectrum with resonant hole-hole ﬁnal

states. In particular, the Fe Auger spectrum has been accurately investigated

in the case of a 2 ML Fe ﬁlm directly deposited on Ag(001) and its shape was

found to be composed by a manifold of hole-hole resonances well accounted by

the Cini-Sawatzky (CS) theory [53, 54, 55] with an eﬀective electron correlation

energy Ueﬀ that resulted to be dependent upon the pairing, in the two-hole ﬁnal

state, of spin and of ligand ﬁeld orbitals [28]. The following data analysis will

proceed in a similar way in order to compare ﬁnal results. In order to take into

account majority and minority spin sub-bands, as well as eg and t2g ligand ﬁeld

orbitals, the same density of states (DOS) calculated by Rhee [56] for Fe/Ag is

used here. The very similar APECS and AR-APECS spectra of the two bilayers

Fe/Ag and Fe/CoO, together with the fact that the Auger signal from iron atoms

9

bonded to oxygen amounts to less than 5%, lead to the conclusion that the same

DOS can be used as input of the CS model for simulating also Fe/CoO Auger

spectra. Assuming four sub-bands, associated to eg and t2g orbitals, each with

majority and minority spin, there are ten possible combinations for the creation

of two holes. Three lead to the emission of two electrons with parallel spin ↑↑,

four with antiparallel spin ↑↓, and three with parallel spin ↓↓. These latter will

be neglected due to the low d electron population of the eg and t2g orbitals [56],

indeed inhibiting the ↓↓ decays where both holes are created in the same ligand

ﬁeld orbital and allowing only the e↓

2g decay.
The background-subtracted AR-APECS spectra are shown in Fig. 5. The

gt↓

dichroic eﬀect enables to assign unambiguously the spin character of the indi-

vidual spectral components; similarly to what found on Fe/Ag [28]. There are

three parallel spin peaks (red ﬁlled curves in Figure 5) which are more intense

in the PS experimental conﬁguration, and four antiparallel spin peaks (green

ﬁlled curves in Figure 5) which are dominant in the AS conﬁguration. The two

AR-APECS spectra have been ﬁtted simultaneously by a function in which the

Cini formula is applied to each possible pairing of the individual spin and or-

bital components of the theoretical DOS, each one with its speciﬁc Ueﬀ value,

plus the contribution of the Fe-O model.

In particular, in order to properly

include the molecular model we have taken into account the dependence of the

photoionization cross section for the 3σ and 3π core-hole states on the angle

between (cid:15) and the photoemission direction, resulting in two slightly diﬀerent

curves (dashed curves in Figures 5a and 5b). The result of the least square

ﬁtting procedure, corresponds to the continuous green and red lines in Fig. 5a

and 5b, respectively. In Table 1 the position in kinetic energy and the asso-

ciated Ueﬀ energies for each hole-hole resonance, as determined by the ﬁtting

procedure, are reported, labelled with the two orbital and the two spin involved

in the decay, and sorted by decreasing value. The values found for the Fe/Ag

bilayer [28] are also reported in parenthesis, for comparison. The molecular cal-

culation contributes to the model lineshape only in a small region of the weakly

correlated part of the spectrum. This means that the formation of a partially

10

oxidized Fe layer is properly taken into account, and it does not play any role

in the low kinetic energy section of the spectrum where the sharp resonant

features are singled out by AR-APECS. The similar behavior of Fe/CoO and

Fe/Ag AR-APECS spectra suggests that the resonant features originate from

the same combinations of spin and orbitals in the two hole ﬁnal states, but with

electron-correlation interactions of diﬀerent strength.

It has been shown [57]

that, even in case of partially ﬁlled bands, the energy separation between the

top of the leading edge of the uncorrelated part of the spectrum and the sharp

hole-hole resonance is linearly dependent upon the electron correlation energy

Ueﬀ characteristic of the speciﬁc hole pair involved. Hence, the diﬀerence in

energy between analogous transitions as measured in Fe/CoO and Fe/Ag [28]

corresponds to the variation of Ueﬀ experienced by Fe valence holes in going

from the non magnetic (Ag) substrate to the antiferromagnetic (CoO) one.

Similarly to what was found for Fe/Ag [28], the variation in Ueﬀ recorded

between ﬁnal states involving identical orbitals but diﬀerent spin conﬁgurations

(parallel or antiparallel) are understood as the spin-ﬂip energy of those states.

It is therefore possible to identify the eﬀects of the Coulomb and the exchange

interactions, separately. For instance, the diﬀerence between the observed en-

ergies of the e↑

ge↑

g and e↑

ge↓

g ﬁnal states, equal to 3.4 eV, is the spin-ﬂip energy

energy associated to the ﬁnal state e↑

of an eg electron, paired with an eg spectator hole. In this way the correlation
ge↑
stood as due to the Coulomb interaction derived by the correlation energy of

g (Ueﬀ=11.9 eV for Fe/CoO) is under-

the e↑

ge↓

g ﬁnal state (Ueﬀ=8.5 eV), plus the spin-ﬂip energy. The Coulomb and

exchange contributions to the Auger spectra, singled out for each hole-hole or-

bital pairing, are listed in the fourth column of Table 1, where in bold the most

signiﬁcative diﬀerences between the two interfaces are highlighted. Within the

experimental uncertainty, it is possible to assess that, in going from Fe/Ag to

Fe/CoO, the Coulomb interaction increases by 1 eV for the eg orbitals while

remains the same for the t2g ones; on the contrary, the exchange interaction is

enhanced by 0.7 eV for the t2g orbitals due to the FM/AFM coupling, while it

remains unchanged for the eg electrons.

Table 1: Electron-correlation energies Ueﬀ , associated to the Auger features singled out

by AR-APECS measurements, are listed in the third column for Fe/CoO and Fe/Ag (in

parenthesis [28]), for each possible hole-hole combination (ﬁrst column), but neglecting the

three ↓↓ contributions (see text); approximate values of the kinetic energy position of each

component are also reported in the second column, to allow for their recognition in Fig. 5.

In the fourth column spin-ﬂip energies are expressed in terms of energy diﬀerence between

ﬁnal states having the same orbital pairing but associated to parallel and antiparallel spin

of the two emitted electrons; Coulomb energies are also listed (see text); in bold, the values

presenting a signiﬁcative diﬀerence between Fe/CoO and Fe/Ag are highlighted. In the Eα(β)

terms, used in the text, the superscript indicates the orbital of the ﬂipped spin while in

parenthesis the spectator hole is indicated. In spite of the relatively large error bars of the

individual experimental points, the uncertainties of the correlation energies U turns out to

be small because the two AR-APECS spectra, in the AS and PS conﬁgurations, are ﬁtted

simultaneously

12

In order to correlate this result with the FM/AFM exchange coupling is help-

ful to recall the concept of spin-ﬂip energy used to deﬁne the exchange-splitting

in the Stoner model. Single electron spin-ﬂip energies (Stoner excitations) are

dominated by intra-atomic interactions, but they are also aﬀected by inter-

atomic interactions, which are usually described by Heisenberg-like exchange

interactions Jij Si Sj in terms of atomic total moments S [59]. Let’s deﬁne the
spin-ﬂip energies Eα(β), with α, β = eg, t2g (see table 1), where the superscript

indicates the orbital of the ﬂipped spin while in parenthesis the spectator hole

(the second hole created in the Auger decay) is indicated. We have for instance

for the t2g electrons

which are the energies necessary to ﬂip the spin of a t2g electron, in two diﬀerent

electronic conﬁgurations of the doubly ionized Auger ﬁnal state: one with a t2g

and one with an eg spectator hole, respectively. The total single electron spin-

ﬂip energy Eα(β), can be written as the sum of an intra-atomic term and an

inter-atomic one

where the sum is over the ﬁrst neighbor-atoms and describes the variation of

the exchange energy due to the spin ﬂip of a single electron at the atomic

site i, which brings the total atomic spin of from Sinitial to Sﬁnal, with ∆Si =

Sﬁnal − Sinitial = 1. The contributions are diﬀerent for atoms in the top or in

where the sum over the ﬁrst neighbor-atoms of a bottom iron atom includes a

SCo = 3/2, as dictated by the ground state 4F9/2 of the 3d7 cobalt electronic
conﬁguration; (iii) the intra-atomic contribution Eα

atom(β) does not change sig-

niﬁcantly when considered for the two diﬀerent substrates; it follows that, when

calculating the diﬀerence in the spin-ﬂip energy ∆Eα(β) between the Fe/Ag

and Fe/CoO systems, the contributions of equation (1) cancel out while those

of equation (2) simply reduce to

∆Eα(β) = Eα(β)Fe/CoO − Eα(β)Fe/Ag =

(3)

The sign of the Co atoms spin has been introduced to include the antiferromag-

netic alignment which may give spins of opposite sign in the same coordination

sphere. From the experiment we have that the left side of equation (3) is zero

for α = eg and ≈ 0.7 eV for α = t2g, while it is reassuring the fact that it does

not depend on the spectator hole β. This means that the exchange interaction

JFe-Co also depends on the orbital α. In other words, the experimentally mea-

sured quantities represented in the left side of equation (3) open a degree of

freedom internal to the electronic structure which is not contemplated in the

Heisenberg-like formalism dealing with total atomic moments, highlighting the

fact that eg and t2g electrons play diﬀerent roles in the magnetism of transition

metals, in particular when systems with diﬀerent properties are put together in

interaction as in complex electromagnetic nano-devices. The energy amount in

(3) is ﬁnally directly connected to the second term of the Mauri model (formula

(1) in [60]) describing the exchange interaction JFM-AFM between the FM spins

and the AFM spins pinned at the interface, which is supposed to be smaller

14

with respect to the bulk exchange stiﬀness of both FM and AFM materials.

Furthermore, in principle, for perfect interfaces with spin-compensated AFM

surfaces the sum in equation (3) would be zero, but, indeed, a non-zero amount

of uncompensated pinned spins for spin compensated surfaces [61], as well as a

very low number of pinned spins in uncompensated surfaces [62], have been un-

derstood for real interfaces. The sum in equation (3) would be then substituted

with an eﬀective number of pinned spins.

In conclusion, the present experiment provides a local microscopic measure,

in the FM magnetic thin ﬁlm interfaced with the AFM substrate, of the single

electron spin-ﬂip energy, which appears to be very sensitive to the FM/AFM

exchange coupling. As a matter of fact, at 170 K, the exchange bias ﬁeld on

the CoO(001) surface is very small: one order of magnitude smaller than in the

CoO(111) one, due to the (partial) spin compensation on the CoO(001) sur-

face [63]. The results of this investigation allow to conclude that the exchange

coupling determines an increase of the average exchange interaction in iron as

probed by AR-APECS, only on the more itinerant t2g orbitals, while the eg ones

are almost unaﬀected. On the other hand, the enhancement of the Coulomb in-

teraction observed on the more localized eg orbitals [58] in the Fe/CoO interface

with respect to the Fe/Ag one, can be attributed to an enhanced localization of

the eg electrons experiencing the proximity with the insulating substrate, with

respect to the metal contact with Ag.

4. Conclusions

AR-APECS spectroscopy has allowed to achieve the elusive objective of mea-

suring the pure Fe MVV Auger lineshape at the Fe/CoO interface. Similarly to

what found for other FM thin ﬁlms (Fe/Cu and Fe/Ag), the MVV spectrum is

composed by a weakly correlated part at high kinetic energy and by a manifold

of electron correlation hole-hole resonances at lower kinetic energies. The AR-

APECS investigation, interpreted with the CS model, has allowed to experimen-

tally single out diﬀerent electron correlation energies Ueﬀ for the diﬀerent pairs

15

of ﬁnal state holes. In this way, the ﬁnding of previous investigations on the de-

pendence of Ueﬀ on the total spin of the ﬁnal state is corroborated [26, 28]. The

present experiment has furthermore investigated the role of electron-electron

correlation in the process of exchange-coupling at Fe/CoO FM/AFM bilayer.

By using a molecular calculation for Fe-O, the contribution to the AR-APECS

intensity of a relatively small amount of iron atoms bonded to oxygen has been

identiﬁed in a limited region of the weakly correlated spectrum and quantiﬁed

to 5% of the total AR-APECS intensity. Such an amount of Fe bonded to oxy-

gen does not play any relevant role in the magnetic properties of the Fe/CoO

bilayer. Finally, the comparison of the AR-APECS spectra of the two interfaces

made it possible to identify, in the FM/AFM case, the increase in the exchange

component of Ueﬀ limited to the t2g orbital. Conversely, the Coulomb compo-

nent increased for the eg orbital only. Taking into account the diﬀerent degree

of localization of the two orbitals, similar to a Fermi liquid for the t2g and to

a Luttinger liquid for the eg, it has been spontaneous to associate the variation

of the exchange component of Ueﬀ with the exchange coupling at the FM/AFM

interface, due to the substrate antiferromagnetism, and of the Coulomb compo-

nent with the insulating nature of the substrate. These results are potentially

of great interest to those who are about to model the technologically relevant

nanosized TM/TMO bilayers.

polarization - momentum (cid:15)K plane, hence a p-polarization scheme is set. Fe 3p photoelectrons

are collected in the (cid:15)K plane at diﬀerent polar angles by the energy-single-channel analyzers

An1-An5, while the Auger electrons are collected by the multichannel analyzer B, 38◦ apart

from the (cid:15)K plane. Considering that (cid:15) acts as a quantization axis, with this arrangement

diﬀerent kinematics can be accessed, sensitive to ﬁnal state with antiparallel spins (AS) or

parallel spins (PS) of the two emitted electrons. See text for further details.

1. The Fe-O molecular model

For the Fe/CoO system, a computational molecular model has been used

to quantify the eﬀect on the Fe M3VV lineshape of the iron atoms bonded

to the oxygen. As shown in Fig.3 of the main text, XPS measurements have

allowed to quantify the formation of iron-oxygen bonds at the interface, as

largely reported in literature [1, 2, 3, 4]. The FeO molecular model has been

implemented imposing a 2 ˚A Fe-O interatomic distance: a value that is similar

to those typically found in Fe oxides [5, 6, 7]. This calculation made use of the

SURPRISES code [8, 9, 10, 11] which implements a theoretical method whose

main features are: (i) the double ionization is treated as a two-step process,

i.e. the primary photoemission and the secondary Auger decay; (ii) the Fano’s

theory of the discrete-continuum interaction is used for calculating both the

primary photoemission and the Auger decay; (iii) the continuum and discrete

wavefunctions are calculated by means of a basis set of gaussian functions. The

chosen gaussian basis set contains the cc-pVQZ for the Fe atom and the cc-pVDZ

for the O atom [12, 13]. The electronic correlations are (partially) taken into

account by performing a conﬁguration interaction (CI) calculation for the bound

states and a many-channel interaction for the continuum escaping electron. The

outcome of this molecular model is a remarkable number of Auger multiplet

components (15 due to decay of the 3σ core hole with m = 0 and 18 due to

the 3π with m = 1). The full set of multiplet terms contributes to a lineshape

mainly regrouped in the energy interval 38 - 48 eV with an almost negligible

contribution in the range 23 - 28 eV, which is an energy range not explored by

the present experiment. The convolution of this rich multiplet structure with

the overall broadening of 1.6 eV FWHM discussed in the main text, and an

intensity set to 10% of the overall Auger intensity, as suggested by the XPS

measures, yields the dotted blue lines in Fig. 6. In this case no adjustment was

applied to the energy scale of the calculation. The main contribution of such a

multiplet calculation is in the region between 43 and 40 eV.

2. Conventional AES analysis

The kinetic energy of an Auger electron is dictated by the binding energies

of the electrons involved, the work function to extract an electron from the

surface, and the eﬀective correlation energy Ueﬀ [14]. The limitation in using

conventional Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to provide precise and speciﬁc

values of Ueﬀ is evidenced in Fig. 6a:

(i) the subtraction of an underlying

background becomes arbitrary when the intensity due to the secondary electrons

emission is much greater than the tiny Auger peak (see inset); (ii) the Co M23VV

Auger line at about 50 eV overlaps the Fe one and the task of investigating the

electronic structure of the Fe overlayer alone is hopeless; (iii) also the Fe M2VV

transition, even if with less intensity, overlaps the Fe M3VV; (iv) ﬁnally, AES

31

spectra, as resulting after a tentative background subtraction, are featureless.

At ﬁrst glance, AES spectra could be understood as band-like, to be inter-

preted neglecting hole-hole correlation in the Auger ﬁnal state, thus predicting

the MVV Auger lineshape by the self-convolution of the Fe valence-band density

of states (SCDOS). The experimental DOS for the Fe ﬁlm is obtained from the

photoelectron spectra of the valence band acquired with 950 eV photons: it is

usually assumed that such a XPS spectrum, averaging over a larger portion of

the Brillouin zone with respect to low energy UPS, better reﬂects the total DOS

of the valence band. The experimental Fe DOS on the CoO substrate has thus

been obtained after the subtraction of the substrate contribution (measured

in a prior measurement) and of a Shirley background [15]. The asymmetry

of the photoline, due to the interaction of the photohole with the conduction

electrons, is taken into account by a Doniach-Sunjic (D-S) proﬁle with an asym-

metry parameter α = 0.2 [16]. The DOS retrieved in this way is subsequently

self-convoluted, broadened by the experimental energy resolution, and aligned

with the experimental AES peak: an alignment at the Fermi level would be

more straightforward, but there is no chance to identify it for the experimen-

tal Fe M3VV spectrum, because its onset is obscured by the overlap with Fe

M2VV transition, and even worse when also the Co M23VV overlaps. A similar

procedure has been adopted for the Fe/CoO system, and adding to the SCDOS

the contribution, concentrated in the region between 43 and 40 eV, due to the

iron-oxide as calculated by the Fe-O model. One could speculate that a major

diﬀerence in the AES intensity between Fe/CoO and Fe/Ag is indeed in this

region, but the arbitrariness of the background subtraction does not allow to

rely on the curves of the AES peak: the slope in this region is in fact strongly

aﬀected by the background subtraction.

In conclusion, AES lineshapes could be explained by the SCDOS, corrected,

in the Fe/CoO case, for the contribution of the small amount of iron atoms

bonded to the oxygen, as displayed by the red dashed (Fe/Ag) and the blue

dashed-dotted (Fe/CoO) lines. This ﬁnding would lead to the conclusion that

in these Fe thin ﬁlms electron correlation is irrelevant.

32

3. Angle integrated APECS spectra

In Fig. 6b, the two APECS spectra for Fe/CoO and Fe/Ag, are shown. They

have been collected adding up all the recorded Auger-photoelectron coincidence

events, regardless of the analyzer pair; in this way, the selectivity in orbital and

spin moment associated to the selection in angle of the two electrons is mitigated

to the level that it becomes irrelevant [17]. Hence, APECS spectra are the pure

Auger lineshapes of the two overlayers under comparison.

The improvement achieved on the Auger spectra by the time-coincident de-

tection of Auger and photoelectrons is evident:

in APECS spectra the back-

ground is completely eliminated before the Auger onset, because Co M23VV

and Fe M2VV Auger electrons, and other prior secondary electrons cannot be

detected in coincidence with the Fe 3p3/2 photoelectrons; only an intrinsic back-

ground remains, which can be easily simulated by a Shirley background [15, 18]

whose intensity is determined by the eﬀective sampling depth of the experi-

ment that equals the inelastic mean free path of the electron pair [19, 20]. The

APECS spectra are no longer featureless and span over a wider energy range,

from a well deﬁned onset, down to 30 eV of kinetic energy. It is interesting to

notice that now, in the region between 40 and 43 eV, the amount by which the

blue curve (Fe/CoO) is above the red one (Fe/Ag) is statistically signiﬁcant and

accounted for by imposing the contribution provided by the Fe-O model to 5%

of the total integrated intensity, as suggested by the coincident photoelectron

analyzers setting (Fig.3 of the main text). This conﬁrms the already proposed

existence of oxidized atoms at the interface [1, 2, 4]. As a consequence, being

the correlation in the localized FeO bonds already taken into account by the

molecular calculation, the diﬀerences in the range 30 - 40 eV have to be ascribed

to electron correlation in the metal iron, acting on the energy position of the

sharp features as described in the main text.
