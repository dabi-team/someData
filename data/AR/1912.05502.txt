ABSTRACT

The detection and analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may enable a broad range of cancer-related applications, including
the identiﬁcation of acquired drug resistance during treatments. However, the non-scalable fabrication, prolonged sample
processing times, and the lack of automation, associated with most of the technologies developed to isolate these rare cells,
have impeded their transition into the clinical practice. This work describes a novel membrane-based microﬁltration device
comprised of a fully automated sample processing unit and a machine-vision-enabled imaging system that allows the efﬁcient
isolation and rapid analysis of CTCs from blood. The device performance was characterized using four prostate cancer cell
lines, including PC-3, VCaP, DU-145, and LNCaP, obtaining high assay reproducibility and capture efﬁciencies greater than
93% after processing 7.5 mL blood samples from healthy donors, spiked with 100 cancer cells. Cancer cells remained viable
after ﬁltration due to the minimal shear stress exerted over cells during the procedure, while the identiﬁcation of cancer cells
by immunostaining was not affected by the number of non-speciﬁc events captured on the membrane. We were also able
to identify the androgen receptor (AR) point mutation T878A from 7.5 mL blood samples spiked with 50 LNCaP cells using
RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Finally, CTCs were detected in 8 of 8 samples from patients diagnosed with metastatic
prostate cancer (mean ± SEM = 21 ± 2.957 CTCs/mL, median = 21 CTC/mL), thereby validating the potential clinical utility of
the device.

Introduction

In the last two decades, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have attracted a signiﬁcant amount of attention for their potential
use as a blood-based biomarker for a broad range of cancer-related clinical applications. CTCs are malignant cells that are
shed from the primary and/or metastatic solid tumors and then inﬁltrate into the vascular and lymphatic systems; these cells

 
 
 
 
 
 
play a fundamental role in the metastatic process of non-hematological cancers1–3. Although the ﬁrst report describing the
existence of CTCs dates from 18694, the heterogeneity and the extremely low concentration of these cells in regard to the
cellular components of blood, about 1-10 CTCs per 109 blood cells, makes their capture extremely challenging5, 6. It was not
until the recent development of technologies with the required sensitivity and reproducibility, that the possibility to perform
CTC-based clinical assays started to become a reality.

To date, numerous studies have shown that CTCs can be used as a prognostic indicator of disease progression and overall
survival in patients with metastatic breast, prostate and colorectal cancer7–10. In addition, changes in the CTC burden in
patients over time have been associated with the effectiveness of the administered therapies11–13. Furthermore, the phenotypic
and genotypic analysis of CTCs can enable the continuous assessment of mutations that confer therapeutic sensitivity or
resistance to targeted therapies, providing information that is of paramount importance for cancer treatment personalization14–16.
Recent studies suggest that CTCs may even have the potential to be used as a biomarker for recurrence and early cancer
detection11, 17, 18.

Many of the technologies developed to isolate CTCs from blood are based on sample enrichment methods that depend
on speciﬁc antigen-antibody interactions, such as microﬂuidic devices functionalized with biomolecules that act as targeting
ligands19–21 or platforms that use micro- or nano-magnetic particles coated with speciﬁc antibodies to isolate these rare
cells22–24. Although these technologies have demonstrated clinical utility, a fundamental problem of these approaches is the lack
of a universal surface marker that is consistently expressed by CTCs. Most of these technologies, including the CellSearch R(cid:13)
System, which is considered the gold standard, use EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) antibodies to selectively trap
cancer cells to the functionalized substrate/particles25. However, CTCs intravasate into the bloodstream by undergoing a
process known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which their epithelial phenotype is downregulated, including
the expression of EpCAM antigens. This fact limits the capture of CTCs subpopulations with diminished expression of this
speciﬁc surface marker, thereby losing valuable information26, 27. Therefore, there exists a need for technologies with different
capture approaches that are independent of surface markers expressed by CTCs.

An effective alternative are microﬁltration devices, which rely on the differences in size and deformability between blood
cells and CTCs to capture these rare cells. These platforms have consistently proven their effectiveness at isolating a greater
number of CTCs in samples from patients with different types of cancer, even capturing CTCs subtypes that no longer express
EpCAM antigens, when compared with approaches based on capture antibodies28–30.

Various microﬁltration technologies such as the commercially available ISET R(cid:13)31 and ScreenCell R(cid:13)32 devices, use polycar-
bonate track-etch membranes. However, the processes used to fabricate these membranes create random pores in the plastic
sheet, making these membranes inadequate for the isolation of CTCs. The porosity of these membranes cannot exceed from
2% without overlapping between pores, while increasing the number of pores beyond this point can hinder the efﬁciency
of separation of cells of similar size in regard to the pore size33. The membranes are therefore restricted to a low porosity,
which can lead to cell damage (due to uneven distribution of pressure over the membrane), lower capture efﬁciency, reduced
reproducibility, and a higher recovery of non-speciﬁc cells (which can potentially clog the membrane)34, 35.

To circumvent these issues, other approaches have utilized membranes crafted through microfabrication techniques. The
advantage of these fabrication processes is the capacity to produce membranes with uniform patterns, where the size, geometry,
quantity, and distribution of pores can be precisely controlled; allowing higher porosities and thereby mitigating the issues
aforementioned. To capture CTCs, several groups have employed microfabricated membranes made from different materials,
such as parylene C34, 36, 37, SU-835, 38, and silicon39, 40. However, the fabrication processes for these membranes are complex,
making their production costly and hardly scalable, limiting their introduction into clinical practice. Recently, photolithography-
based electroforming, a technique that enables the production of highly precise metal structures, has been utilized to fabricate
ﬁlters used for the isolation of cellular subpopulations, including CTCs from blood samples41–43. In contrast with the ones
created with other manufacturing methods, these membranes could be mass produced at a signiﬁcantly lower cost.

Nevertheless, despite of the membrane used, the microﬁltration technologies developed so far, are not capable of processing,
preparing, and analyzing the captured cells in an automated way28, 29, 31, 32, 34–41, 43; easily leading to human error and cell loss
due to the manual steps that must be performed. Additionally, performing a proper enumeration of the captured CTCs requires
optical analysis with highly specialized microscopes that may not be available in all clinical settings.

In order to standardize the use of CTCs as a biomarker in clinical practice, it is fundamental to acknowledge the necessity
of developing platforms with high recovery rates and the capacity of carrying out the entire sample workﬂow, without human
intervention. In this manuscript, we present a novel automated microﬁltration device that utilizes electroformed nickel
membranes and a machine-vision-enabled microscope speciﬁcally designed for the efﬁcient isolation and analysis of CTCs.
The performance of this platform is characterized using blood samples from healthy donors spiked with prostate cancer cells,
and the results obtained after processing samples from patients with diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer are also discussed in
this work.

Methods

Blood extraction
Blood samples from healthy male donors and patients with diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer were provided by the urology
service of the “Dr. José Eleuterio González” University Hospital, according to the protocol approved by their Institutional
Review Board with number UR16-0007. Prior to blood extraction, informed consent was obtained from healthy donors and
cancer patients. Samples were collected in 6 mL BD Vacutainer R(cid:13) K2EDTA blood collection tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, New
Jersey, USA) and were processed through our device within 3 hours after the extraction. All procedures involving human
participants were performed in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical
standards.

Cell culture of cancer cell lines
Human prostate cancer cell lines (ATCC R(cid:13), Manassas, Virginia, USA), PC-3 (CRL-1435TM), LNCaP clone FGC (CRL-1740TM),
DU-145 (HTB-81TM), and VCaP (CRL-2876TM) were cultured using F-12K, RPMI-1640, EMEM, and DMEM media (ATCC R(cid:13),
Manassas, Virginia, USA), respectively. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ATCC R(cid:13), Manassas,
Virginia, USA). Cultures were incubated at 37◦C in an air atmosphere of 5% CO2 and harvested from T-25 ﬂasks using 0.25%
trypsin - 0.02% EDTA solution (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) when 80% conﬂuence was reached.
Cells were quantiﬁed with a hemocytometer and viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. A viability of at least
95% was achieved after harvesting.

Preparation and processing of spiked blood samples for capture efﬁciency and purity assessment
To evaluate device performance, PC-3, LNCaP, DU-145, or VCaP prostate cancer cells were stained prior to being spiked
into blood samples from healthy donors by incubating cell cultures with 25 µM of CellTrackerTM orange CMRA (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) for 45 min at 37◦C in an air atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were harvested
using 0.25% trypsin - 0.02% EDTA solution (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and counted with a
hemocytometer. The resulting cell suspension was serially diluted to achieve a concentration of approximately 100 cancer
cells per 30 µL; that volume was then added to the blood samples. Subsequently, spiked blood samples were diluted with a
0.3% formaldehyde - 0.15% pluronic F68 solution in PBS to a 1:2 v/v ratio and incubated for 10 min at room temperature
before being processed by the device, at either 2 or 3 mL/min ﬂow rates, using membranes with a 7, 8, or 9 µm pore size.
Once the samples were ﬁltered, 0.1% pluronic F68 solution in PBS was ﬂowed to wash out blood cells remaining on the
membrane, followed by ﬁxation and nuclear staining which were carried out by incubating the membrane for 10 min after
passing 1 mL of 4% formaldehyde and 1 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 solutions at 500 µL/min, respectively. At the end of each
incubation, 0.1% pluronic F68 solution in PBS was used to wash the remnants of the ﬁxative and nuclear staining dye. Finally,
the holder was disassembled and the membrane was mounted on a microscope slide using Fluoromount-GTM (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) for its subsequent analysis by ﬂuorescence microscopy.

To properly estimate the number of tumor cells spiked into blood samples, equal volumes of the cancer cell suspension
were added to 10 wells of a 96-well plate. The capture efﬁciency of the microﬁltration device was determined by comparing the
number of cancer cells trapped by the membrane against the average number of cells counted on the wells. To calculate purity,
the total number of tumor cells was divided by the total number of nucleated events along the membrane.

Preparation and processing of spiked blood samples for viability assessment
The LIVE/DEADTM assay was used to evaluate cell viability. PC-3 cancer cells were pre-stained with CellTrackerTM blue
CMF2HC (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and spiked into samples from healthy donors at a
concentration of 1000 cells per 7.5 mL of blood. Spiked samples were diluted with a 0.15% pluronic F68 solution in PBS to
a 1:2 v/v ratio and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before being processed by the device. Once the samples were
ﬁltered, 0.1% pluronic F68 solution in PBS was ﬂowed at 500 µL/min during 10 min to wash the blood cells unspeciﬁcally
captured on the membrane. Afterward, 1 mL of 2 µM calcein AM - 4 µM ethidium homodimer-1 solution was passed at 500
µL/min, followed by a 45 min incubation. Then, the holder was disassembled and the membrane was mounted on a microscope
slide for its analysis by ﬂuorescence microscopy.

Blue/green ﬂuorescent events were classiﬁed as live tumor cells, whereas blue/red events were counted as dead cancer cells.
Cell viability was calculated as a percentage by dividing the total number of live tumor cells by the total number of cancer cells
along the membrane.

RT-PCR analysis and sequencing
Healthy blood samples, spiked with 15, 50, 250, 500, and 1000 LNCaP cells were processed at 2 mL/min. After ﬁltration, 0.1%
pluronic F68 solution in PBS was ﬂowed through the device at 500 µL/min for 10 min to wash out cellular residues before
transferring the membranes to microcentrifuge tubes for nucleic acid extraction. Total RNA was isolated from the cells captured

3/13

in the membrane using the AllPrep R(cid:13) DNA/RNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, excluding the deparafﬁnization steps. Full-length cDNA was produced from total RNA by ﬁrst-strand cDNA
synthesis using the SuperScript IVTM First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts,
USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. A 599 base pair coding region of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the
androgen receptor (AR) was ampliﬁed using the Platinum SuperFi PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham,
Massachusetts, USA) and the following primer pairs: forward 5(cid:48)-CCAATGTCAACTCCAGGATGCTCTAC-3(cid:48), and reverse
5(cid:48)-AATTCCCCAAGGCACTGCAGA-3(cid:48). PCR amplicons were puriﬁed using the PureLink R(cid:13) Quick Gel Extraction kit, for
further Sanger sequencing. Sequencing electropherograms were compared to the reference sequence for the AR (NM_000044.4)
to identify the missense mutation T878A.

Preparation, processing and on-membrane immunoﬂuorescence staining of blood samples from patients with metastatic
prostate cancer
Blood samples of 7.5 mL from patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer were diluted with a 0.3% formaldehyde -
0.15% pluronic F68 solution in PBS to a 1:2 v/v ratio and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before being processed
through the device at a ﬂow rate of 2 mL/min. Once the samples were ﬁltered, 0.1% pluronic F68 solution in PBS was ﬂowed to
wash out the remaining blood cells captured by the membrane. Fixation was performed by ﬂowing 1 mL of 4% formaldehyde
in PBS at 500 µL/min, followed by a 10 min incubation. Subsequently, permeabilization was carried out by passing 1 mL
of 0.3% PBST at 500 µL/min, followed by a 10 min incubation. Afterward, to prevent non-speciﬁc binding of antibodies,
blocking was made by ﬂowing 1 mL of 1% BSA in 0.1% PBST at 500 µL/min followed by an incubation of 30 min. Then, 500
µL of an antibody cocktail containing 8 µg/mL of alexa ﬂuor R(cid:13) 488 labeled anti-cytokeratin (pan reactive) (clone C-11), alexa
ﬂuor R(cid:13) 647 labeled anti-human CD45 (clone HI30), and biotin labeled anti-human PSMA (FOLH1) (clone LNI-17) antibodies
(BioLegend, San Diego, California, USA) in 1% BSA - 0.1% PBST solution was ﬂowed through at 250 µL/min followed by a
1 hour incubation. Finally, 500 µL of a mixture containing 1 µg/mL of Hoechst 33342 and 8 µg/mL of streptavidin-alexa
ﬂuor R(cid:13) 568 conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) in 1% BSA - 0.1% PBST solution was ﬂowed
at 250 µL/min, followed by a 1 hour incubation. Washing steps of 5 min were carried out at 500 µL/min after ﬁnishing each
incubation with the solutions described above. After ﬁxation, and for the ﬁnal washing step, 0.1% pluronic F68 in PBS was
used, while a 0.1% PBST solution was utilized in between to wash out the residues of the remaining solutions.

Statistical Analysis
All the experiments with prostate cancer cell lines were performed in triplicates. These results, along with the ones obtained in
clinical samples, are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The difference between means was determined by
unpaired t-test, where a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results

Automated microﬁltration device and imaging system
We have built an automated microﬁltration device and an imaging system for the efﬁcient isolation and rapid analysis of CTCs
from blood samples. Electroformed nickel membranes with square-shaped pores of 7, 8, and 9 µm size were employed for
processing blood samples; all of them with a 17 µm pore spacing.

To prevent leakage during sample processing, each membrane was placed on a custom-made PMMA holder fabricated with
a computer numerical control (CNC) micro-milling machine (MDA Precision, Morgan Hill, California, USA). This holder is
constituted by an upper part, bottom part, and screw cap, as shown in Fig. 1-a. The upper and bottom parts have a 1/4”- 28
threaded ﬂat-bottom port that allows an easy connection to external components using standard microﬂuidic ﬁttings. Both parts,
also have a 0.9 mm microchannel that disembogue into a microchamber of 130 µl, designed to minimize the dead volume of
the holder and ensure an appropriate distribution of ﬂow throughout the processing area. The membrane is sandwiched between
the upper and bottom parts of the holder along with two O-rings, and the setup is fastened by screwing in the cap to the thread
milled in the holder’s bottom part. The sample processing area, which is the surface of the membrane that is in contact with the
sample, is delimited by the holder and has a 9 mm diameter. This translates to an approximate number of 110440, 101790, and
94110 pores for the 7, 8, and 9 µm pore size membranes, respectively, corresponding to a porosity of 8.50%, 10.24%, and
11.98% each.

The holder is connected to a fully automated ﬂow control unit (Fig. 1-b), which consists of a diaphragm compressor as
pressure source, an electronic proportional valve that controls the pressure applied to the sample and reagent reservoirs, an
electronic rotary valve to select from which reservoir liquid is expelled, and a ﬂow sensor that provides the necessary feedback
to precisely compute the pressure needed in the selected reservoir to maintain the desired ﬂow rate. The entire system is
commanded by a microcontroller that follows user-deﬁned protocols, which can be programmed using a graphical user interface
in a personal computer. This platform is able to process blood samples and to perform on-ﬁlter ﬁxation and immunostaining of
the captured cells automatically, without requiring disassembly of the holder.

acquired with our imaging system comprised of a four-channel ﬂuorescence microscope with a motorized stage and an
autofocus routine that allows the scanning of the membrane with high precision (Fig. 1-c), and a machine vision algorithm that
automatically counts the ﬂuorescent events categorized as CTCs (Fig. 1-d). Moreover, further corroboration of classiﬁed cells
can be performed by a qualiﬁed technician through a software interface that allows the individual visualization of cells that were
classiﬁed as CTCs. A detailed description and validation of the imaging system performance can be found in Aguilar-Avelar et
al.44

In addition, if molecular analyses are required, the membrane can be collected in a microtube for nucleic acid extraction

using commercially available kits.

Capture efﬁciency and purity assessment
To characterize the performance of our microﬁltration device, PC-3 cancer cells were pre-stained with CellTrackerTM orange
CMRA and spiked into blood samples from healthy donors at a concentration of 100 cells per 7.5 mL. The samples were
diluted, preﬁxed, and processed through the device, followed by on-membrane ﬁxation and nuclear staining, as described in
the Methods section. Subsequently, an image of the entire membrane was acquired with our imaging system, and ﬂuorescent
events were automatically classiﬁed and enumerated.

Capture efﬁciency and purity were evaluated using membranes with pore sizes of 7, 8, and 9 µm and ﬂow rates of 2 and 3
mL/min. Irrespective of the membrane and ﬂow rate tested, spiked blood samples were processed without seeing any signs of
coagulation.

The pore size of the membrane and the ﬂow rate at which the samples were processed, demonstrated to be directly related
to the device capture efﬁciency, as depicted in Fig. 2-a. When utilizing membranes with a 7 µm pore size and processing
samples at a ﬂow rate of 2 mL/min, an average capture efﬁciency of 98.09% ± 1.82% was obtained, dropping to 93% ± 5.69%
when the ﬂow rate was increased to 3 mL/min. When samples were processed through membranes with a 8 µm pore size, the
capture efﬁciency was maintained above 85%, regardless of the ﬂow rate established. Similar values were observed while using
membranes with a 9 µm pore size after ﬁltering samples at 2 mL/min, but the value plummeted to 72% ± 6.45% when the ﬂow
rate was set to 3 mL/min.

Overall, the rate of contaminant events decreased as the pore size of the membranes was increased and samples were
processed at higher ﬂow rates. An average of 745 ± 65 nucleated events were captured when samples were ﬁltered through
membranes of 9 µm pore size under ﬂow rates of 3 mL/min, in comparison to the 4144 ± 315 nucleated cells captured when
using membranes of 7 µm pore size and samples were processed at ﬂow rates of 2 mL/min. Considering the number of tumor
cells captured after processing spiked samples, these results corresponded to an average purity of 1.64% ± 0.22% and 0.29% ±
0.02%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2-b.

Based on the high capture efﬁciency obtained and despite the number of recovered non-speciﬁc events, the following
experiments were carried out with membranes of 7 µm of pore size and samples being processed at a ﬂow rate of 2 mL/min. Fig.
3 shows a representative micrograph of the captured cells after processing a spiked blood sample under this set of parameters,
as well as the results obtained after performing the automatic classiﬁcation and counting.

Capture efﬁciency using different prostate cancer cell lines
Besides the characterization made with PC-3 cells, the performance of the microﬁltration device was also assessed using VCaP,
DU-145, and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines. Similarly, 7.5 mL blood samples from healthy donors were spiked with 100
pre-stained cells and processed through the device as described in the Experimental section. Capture efﬁciencies of 99.51% ±
1.47%, 94% ± 3.60%, and 98.92% ± 2.06% were obtained for VCaP, DU-145, and LNCaP, respectively, as seen in Fig. 2-c.
The number of contaminant events was maintained at similar levels to those described for the PC-3 cell line experiments.

The relative standard deviation (RSD), obtained from the experiments carried out with the four different cell lines, ranged
between 1.93 and 6.65%. Altogether, the results suggest that our microﬁltration device has a high capture efﬁciency and assay
reproducibility when processing spiked samples.

Viability assessment
The LIVE/DEADTMassay was used to evaluate cell viability. To identify tumor cells from the background of blood cells
captured in the membrane, PC-3 cancer cells were pre-stained with CellTrackerTM blue CMF2HC before being spiked into the
blood samples from healthy donors. Tumor cell viability was calculated by quantifying the number of blue/green (viable) and
blue/red (dead) ﬂuorescent events along the membrane. An average viability of 90.3% ± 0.88% was achieved after ﬁltering
spiked blood samples, in comparison to the 96% ± 1.53% observed in the tumor cell suspension, demonstrating that the shear
stress exerted on cells is minimal, leading to high recovery rates of viable cells.

LNCaP cells (c) with the one acquired from a suspension containing only PC-3 cells (d). The underline denotes the nucleotides
comprising the AR 878 codon and the asterisks indicate the nucleotide that is switched.

Molecular analysis
To demonstrate that our device is compatible with standard molecular analysis, 15, 50, 250, 500, and 1000 LNCaP cells
were spiked into 7.5 mL of blood samples from healthy donors and processed through the device for the identiﬁcation of AR
transcripts by RT-PCR. AR gene expression was consistently conﬁrmed by agarose gel electrophoresis in samples spiked with
as low as 50 cells, which is equivalent to approximately 7 cells per mL, while non-spiked blood samples were negative, as
shown in Fig. 4-a and 4-b. In addition, the presence of the AR point mutation T878A, harbored by the LNCaP cell line, was
successfully identiﬁed by Sanger sequencing after processing a blood sample spiked with 50 LNCaP cells and comparing the
results with the ones derived from analyzing a sample containing only PC-3 cells, which possess the wild-type genotype, as
depicted in Fig. 4-c and 4-d.

The PCR products obtained from the membranes used to ﬁlter samples were successfully ampliﬁed by hemi-nested PCR
(hn-PCR) when spiked with 15 cells, which is equivalent to approximately 2 cells per mL, enabling the detection of AR
transcripts in two of the three experiments done with this concentration. This suggested that a lower limit of detection could be
achievable with the use of more sensitive techniques, such as qRT-PCR or digital PCR (dPCR). No DNA bands were seen after
reampliﬁcation of PCR reactions obtained from the membranes used to ﬁlter non-spiked blood samples.

Detection of CTCs from patients with metastatic prostate cancer
To demonstrate that our platform can isolate CTCs from clinical samples, we used our device to process 8 samples of patients
diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (age range: 56-80), who were under a therapeutic regimen, and 8 samples from
healthy male controls (age range: 30-54), followed by on-membrane immunostaining as described in the protocol detailed
in the Methods section. The typical deﬁnition of CTC involves a nucleated cell that expresses epithelial proteins, such as
cytokeratins 8, 18, and/or 19, while being negative for the leukocyte-speciﬁc antigen CD-45. We have incorporated the prostate
speciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA) into this deﬁnition; PSMA is a transmembrane protein that is usually overexpressed in
malignant prostate cancer cells and its expression increases as the disease progresses45, 46. Nucleated cells with the phenotypes
CK+/PSMA+/CD45-, CK+/PSMA-/CD45-, and CK-/PSMA+/CD45- were enumerated as CTCs.

patients. The number of events categorized as CTCs in control samples led us to establish a threshold of clinical signiﬁcance of
10 CTC/mL. The differences between the number of CTCs found in these two groups were statistically signiﬁcant
(p < 0.0001).

The number of cells categorized as CTCs, after analyzing control samples, ranged from 3 to 8 cells per mL of blood (mean
± SEM = 5 ± 0.597 CTCs/mL, median = 5 CTC/mL). These results led us to establish a threshold of clinical signiﬁcance of 10
CTC/mL. The CTC count in all samples from patients surpassed this value, ranging from 12 to 35 cells per mL of blood (mean
± SEM = 21 ± 2.957 CTCs/mL, median = 21 CTC/mL). The difference between the means of both groups was statistically
signiﬁcant (p < 0.0001). Fig. 5 summarizes the results obtained after the analysis of patient and control samples. Fig. 6 shows
a micrograph of CTCs isolated from a patient diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, as well as the resulting classiﬁcation
masks generated by the counting software.

Nucleated cells with a CK+/PSMA+/CD45+ phenotype were also observed in control and patient samples. The isolation
of cells expressing epithelial, tissue-speciﬁc, and leukocyte markers has been reported in many instances and with different
technologies11, 47. Interestingly, these events were found in greater numbers than for the cells classiﬁed as tumoral and were
more prevalent in patient samples than in controls; however, they were not counted as CTCs.

Discussion

CTCs have demonstrated their potential as a blood-based biomarker that can be used on a broad range of cancer-related clinical
applications. This has been possible due to the recent development of several technologies, which have enabled the isolation
and subsequent analysis of these malignant cells. However, despite the capture approach used, the non-scalable fabrication,
prolonged sample processing times, and the lack of automation, of most of these technologies, represent substantial limitations
that impede their transition from research tools to solutions employed in the standard clinical practice.

In this manuscript, we presented a novel automated microﬁltration device that integrates an imaging system for the efﬁcient
isolation and rapid analysis of CTCs from blood samples. This platform can process 7.5 mL blood samples in less than 12
minutes, in comparison with other technologies that can only process signiﬁcantly lower amounts of sample and require hours
to do so12, 19, 48. Due to the rarity of CTCs, technologies able to process high volumes of sample are desirable. Microﬁltration
devices are capable of processing samples in matter of minutes, however several of them have only reported to do it with small
sample volumes38, 41, 42, 49. On the other hand, our device makes possible automatic on-membrane ﬁxation and immunostaining
without needing to disassemble the holder, enhancing practicality and avoiding cell loss during the staining process.

The integrated imaging system comprises a four-channel ﬂuorescence microscope with motorized stage and an autofocus
routine that was speciﬁcally designed for scanning the entire membrane with high precision. The relevance of the above relies
on the fact that usually the ﬁlters suffer a deformation while processing the sample, resulting fundamental for the microscope
to be capable of automatically focus when scanning large areas. Moreover, it also possesses a machine-vision algorithm that
automatically counts the ﬂuorescent events categorized as CTCs, thereby eliminating the subjective interpretation of operators
and increasing the reproducibility of analysis, while decreasing the time needed to manually enumerate the CTCs captured.
Further corroboration of classiﬁed cells can also be performed by a trained technician through a software interface that allows
the individual visualization of cells selected as CTCs. These attributes facilitate the identiﬁcation of predictive and therapeutic

markers expressed in CTCs, such as AR-V7, HER-2, EGFR, among others.

High capture efﬁciency and high reproducibility were achieved after processing spiked blood samples from healthy donors,
with our device. Four different prostate cancer cells were used to characterize the device performance, and it was found that
the capture efﬁciency of this platform was greater than 93% among the four cells lines tested, having an average of 4144
non-speciﬁc nucleated events contaminating the enriched sample and small coefﬁcients of variation, which denotes high
reproducibility. Our recovery rates were superior than the ones obtained by several microﬁltration devices36–38, 40, 50, 51. In
addition, it was observed that the level of cellular contamination did not affect the identiﬁcation of cells by immunostaining.
Moreover, tumor cells remained viable after sample processing, demonstrating that the shear stress exerted on cells during
ﬁltering did not compromise their integrity.

We were also able to successfully isolate total RNA from the cells captured on the ﬁltration membrane. This was
demonstrated by identifying the AR gene expression from 7.5 ml blood samples spiked with 50 LNCaP cancer cells (less than 7
cells per mL) by means of RT-PCR, as well as the point mutation T878A harbored in this cell line using Sanger sequencing.
The relevance of this ﬁnding is that missense mutations often lead to the development of therapeutic resistance in several
types of cancers. The noninvasive identiﬁcation of these point mutations can aid physicians in monitoring changes in tumor
genotypes during the course of treatments, enabling the personalization of cancer therapies. The results obtained after the
reampliﬁcation of PCR products, derived from the cells captured on the membranes used to ﬁlter 7.5 mL samples spiked with a
total of 15 cancer cells, suggest that the implementation of more sensitive techniques aimed at enriching target molecules, such
as qRT-PCR and dPCR, could increase our limits of detection. Besides, due to the easy detachment of the membrane from the
holder, single cells could be isolated by micropipette aspiration or by attaching a micromanipulator to the imaging system to
perform single cell sequencing in order to enable the study of CTCs heterogeneity in cancer patients; unlike other ﬁlter-based
microdevices that require additional steps to retrieve the tumor cells captured, which leads to further cell loss38, 52.

from healthy donors. Events classiﬁed as CTCs were observed in control samples, leading us to establish a threshold of
clinical signiﬁcance of 10 cancer cells per mL, similar to that reported by11. CTCs above this threshold were detected in all
patient samples, and their number was higher than those observed in control samples, even though some of these patients were
clinically responding to the administered therapies. The number of CTCs captured by our device, points to the feasibility of
monitoring the dynamic changes in CTC burden over time, implying that the treatment effectiveness follow-up would also be
possible with our system.

Over 80% of the CTCs found in patient samples presented dual expression of cytokeratin and PSMA. Variability in the
cytokeratin staining intensity, which is reported to occur during the EMT, was observed in CTCs, while PSMA expression
remained consistent, supporting the use of this marker to discriminate between CTCs and blood cells in patients with advanced
prostate cancer. Moreover, nucleated cells with a CK+/PSMA+/CD45+ phenotype were also observed in both the control and
the patient samples. These cells were found in a greater concentration than the CTCs, and appear with a higher frequency in
patient samples than in controls; these ﬁndings were similar to those reported when using other technologies11, 47. Nevertheless,
the clinical signiﬁcance of these events warrants further study.

In conclusion, CTCs have demonstrated their potential as a powerful biomarker that can be continuously assessed to
determine phenotypic and genotypic changes that confer therapeutic sensitivity/resistance during the course of cancer treatments.
However, most of the technologies designed to capture these rare cells are not easily transferable to clinical practice. We
have developed a novel membrane-based microﬁltration device that integrates a fully automated sample processing unit and
a machine-vision-enabled imaging system for the efﬁcient isolation and rapid analysis of CTCs from blood; the platform
allows the automation of the sample processing, immunostaining steps, analysis, and classiﬁcation of ﬂuorescent events for
the identiﬁcation of cancer cells. Capture efﬁciencies greater than 93% and coefﬁcients of variation below 7% were achieved
after processing samples from healthy donors spiked with different prostate cancer cell lines, while the isolated cells remained
viable and suitable for molecular analysis. Moreover, CTCs above the established threshold of 10 cell/mL were detected in
every sample from the 8 patients with metastatic disease. Although large-scale clinical studies need to be done, these results,
in addition to the fast processing time and large sample volume that can be processed by our platform, make this device a
promising tool that can be rapidly integrated into clinical practice. Currently, a study with a larger cohort of prostate cancer
patients is being carried out in order to continue the validation of this technology and the assessment of its clinical potential.
