Abstract. We use a sample of 37 H ii regions with high quality spec-
tra to study the behavior of the relative abundances of several elements
as a function of metallicity. The sample includes spectra for eight H ii
regions of the Magellanic Clouds, obtained with UVES/VLT; the rest are
gathered from the literature. We Ô¨Ånd that if we use the traditional two-
zone scheme of temperature for the observed ions, the S/O, Cl/O and
Ar/O abundance ratios increase with metallicity. However, with slight
changes in the temperature structure, which include the use of intermedi-
ate temperatures, these ratios are constant with metallicity, as expected.
Therefore, high quality observations allow us to deepen our understanding
of the temperature structure of H ii regions.

Key words: H ii regions: chemical abundances

Introduction

The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are nearby, low-metallicity galaxies, that provide
an excellent opportunity to explore in detail the behavior of the chemical com-
position of H ii regions as a function of metallicity. However, it is diÔ¨Écult to
obtain reliable optical spectra of H ii regions in the MCs since these galaxies are
generally observed at high airmasses, making the observations very sensitive to
the eÔ¨Äects of atmospheric diÔ¨Äerential refraction (Filippenko, 1982). In fact, of all
the available spectra of MC H ii regions (Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert, 1974; Du-
four, 1975; Pagel et al., 1978; Dufour et al., 1982; Stasi≈Ñska et al., 1986; Tsamis
et al., 2003; Naz√© et al., 2003; Peimbert, 2003), only the spectrum of 30 Doradus
presented by Peimbert (2003) can be considered of high quality since it is a deep
spectrum with high wavelength coverage and relatively high spectral resolution
that was obtained using an atmospheric dispersion corrector. Here we present
eight new spectra of H ii regions in the MCs of comparable quality, which, along
with a sample of high quality spectra compiled from the literature, allow us to

electron temperature can be easily measured in both cases.

explore diÔ¨Äerent issues related to the analysis of the chemical composition of H ii
regions at diÔ¨Äerent metallicities.

2. Observational data

We obtained echelle spectra of eight H ii regions in the MCs, four in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and four in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The
data were taken with UVES/VLT (Cerro Paranal Observatory, Chile). The
spectral range 3100-10400 ÀöA was covered with a resolution of ‚àÜŒª ‚àº Œª/11600.
The atmospheric dispersion corrector was used to keep the same observed re-
gion within the slit at diÔ¨Äerent wavelengths, since the MCs are observed at high
airmasses (between 1.35 and 1.88). Figure 1 shows the wavelength range that in-
cludes the HŒ≥ and [O iii] Œª4363 lines for our best (SMC-N81) and worst spectrum
(SMC-N90).
The reddening coeÔ¨Écient, c(HŒ≤), is determined by comparing the intensities of
several Balmer and Paschen lines relative to HŒ≤ with their case B values (Storey
& Hummer, 1995). We use lines whose upper levels have principal quantum
numbers n ‚â§ 7, since for n > 7 the lines depart from their expected case B
values (see the empty symbols in Figure 2). This behavior was previously found
in the Orion Nebula by Mesa-Delgado et al. (2009), who argue that it could arise
from collisions that change the quantum number l by more than ¬±1 or from the
pumping of the H i lines by absorption of the stellar continuum.
We use the reddening law of Howarth (1983), which has a ratio of total to selective
extinction Rv = 3.1 and is commonly used for the MCs, for all objects excepting

provided a better Ô¨Åt. Figure 2 illustrates these results for IC 2111 and N88A.
To this sample of eight MC H ii regions, we have added 29 H ii regions from the
literature that have spectra of similar quality (Garc√≠a-Rojas et al., 2004, 2005,
2006, 2007; Esteban et al., 2004, 2009, 2014, 2017; Toribio San Cipriano et al.,
2016; Peimbert, 2003).

3. Results

We have performed a homogeneous analysis of all regions in the sample. The
calculations of physical conditions and ionic abundances are carried out with
PyNeb (Luridiana et al., 2015). We use the density diagnostics ne([O ii]),
ne([S ii]), ne([Cl iii]), and ne([Ar iv]), and the temperature diagnostics Te([N ii])
and Te([O iii]) to characterize the gas of the nebula. We estimate the ionic
abundances assuming a scheme of two temperatures; Te([N ii]) for S+, O+,
and N+; and Te([O iii]) for S++, Cl++, O++, and Ne++. We do not use the
other available temperature diagnostics, Te([O ii]), Te([S iii]), and Te([Ar iii]),

because they are aÔ¨Äected by diÔ¨Äerent problems (recombination eÔ¨Äects, telluric
absorption) and have higher uncertainties than Te([N ii]) and Te([O iii]).
The total abundance of nitrogen is obtained using the classical ionization cor-
rection factor (ICF), N/O = N+/O+. For the rest of the elements we use the
ICFs provided by Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014). These ICFs were derived using
photoionization models tailored for planetary nebulae, but they work better than
those provided by Izotov et al. (2006) for H ii regions, leading to somewhat lower
dispersions. Besides, the photoionization models for H ii regions of Reyes-P√©rez
et al. (2019, in preparation) conÔ¨Årm their validity.
The methodology described above, the most used in the literature, gives us as
a result that the Cl/O, Ar/O, and S/O abundance ratios increase with metal-
licity (left panels in Figure 3 for Cl/O and S/O). On the other hand, if we use
Te([N ii]) to calculate Cl++ and the mean of Te([N ii]) and Te([O iii]) for S++
and Ar++, we Ô¨Ånd that Cl/O, Ar/O, and S/O are approximately constant with
metallicity (right panels in Figure 3), as expected. In the case of Ne++, we Ô¨Ånd
that the use of Te([O iii]) to calculate its abundance is appropriate, but we Ô¨Ånd
a large dispersion in the values derived for Ne/O (see the left panel in Figure 4).
However, this dispersion is due to the behavior of the ICF for Ne, since it is also
found when the spectra predicted by the photoionization models of Reyes-P√©rez
et al. (2019, in preparation) are analyzed in the same way as the observed spectra
(right panel of Figure 4).

4. Conclusions

We present new determinations of chemical abundances of eight H ii regions
in the MCs based on deep echelle spectra taken with UVES/VLT. The quality
of the spectra allows us to explore which extinction law is working better for
each object. We have extended the sample including spectra with the same
quality as the main sample. We Ô¨Ånd that if we use the traditional two-zone
scheme of temperature, the abundance ratios Cl/O, S/O and Ar/O increase
with metallicity. However, with slight changes in the temperature structure,
these abundance ratios are constant with metallicity, as expected.
