ABSTRACT 
This paper is the first report of n-type GaAs as a cryogenic scintillation radiation detector for the 
detection of electron recoils from interacting dark matter (DM) particles in the poorly explored 
MeV/c2  mass  range.  Seven  GaAs  samples  from  two  commercial  suppliers  and  with  different 
silicon and boron concentrations were studied for their low temperature optical and scintillation 
properties. All samples are n-type even at low temperatures and exhibit emission between silicon 
donors and boron acceptors that peaks at 1.33 eV (930 nm). The lowest excitation band peaks at 
1.44 eV (860 nm) and the overlap between the emission and excitation bands is small. The X-ray 
excited  luminosities  range  from  7  to  43  photons/keV.  Thermally  stimulated  luminescence 
measurements show that n-type GaAs does not accumulate metastable radiative states that could 
cause  afterglow.  Further  development  and  use  with  cryogenic  photodetectors  promises  a 
remarkable combination of large target size, ultra-low backgrounds, and a sensitivity to electron 
recoils of a few eV that would be produced by DM particles as light as a few MeV/c2.  

Keywords:  MeV/c2,  dark  matter,  electron recoil, GaAs,  cryogenic,  scintillation,  donor-acceptor 
emission, Mott transition, afterglow. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

Despite overwhelming evidence that large amounts of cold DM are gravitationally associated 
with  galaxies  and  galactic  clusters,  recent  large-scale  experiments  designed  to  detect  nuclear 
recoils from DM particles with masses above 1 GeV/c2 have not yet seen a definitive signal [1-6]. 
This  has  motivated  designs  for  experiments  that  search  for  DM  particles  in  the  MeV/c2  range, 
using both electron and nuclear recoils. Calculations show that due to more favorable kinematics, 
light DM particles are expected to interact more efficiently with electrons than with nuclei [7-9]. 
For  example,  a  DM  particle  with  a  mass  of  10  MeV/c2  and  a  typical  velocity  of  10–3 c  has  a 
kinetic energy of 5 eV, most of which can be transferred to a recoil electron and detected by low 
band gap detector materials. In contrast, the maximum energy that can be transferred by the same 
DM particle to a helium nucleus in an elastic collision is 0.05 eV, whose detection will require 
the use of ultra-low energy threshold processes such as the detection of helium atoms evaporated 
from  super-fluid  helium  [10-12].  It  is  important  to  search  for  both  electron  and  nuclear  recoils 
since it is not known whether DM is leptophilic, hadrophilic, or both [13]. 

The calculations also show that energetic electron recoils are strongly suppressed and that the 
maximum detection rates will occur for electron recoil energies that are a small multiple of the 
band gap, even for DM masses as high as 1 GeV/c2 [9]. As a result, the best detector materials 
for this application should have low bandgaps and low backgrounds. Scintillation detectors have 
an  advantage  over  semiconductor  ionization  detectors  (e.g.  Ge)  in  that  they  do  not  require  an 
electric  field  and  afterglow  from  metastable  radiative  states  is  expected  to  be  lower  than  dark

currents [14]. This led to the choice of n-type GaAs for this work because of its low band gap 
(1.52 eV), donor-acceptor luminescence [15, 16], and the commercial production of large, high-
quality  crystals.  An  additional  advantage  is  the  apparent  absence  of  afterglow,  presented  in 
Section III D of this paper. 

This  paper  presents  the  first  measurements  of  GaAs  as  a  cryogenic  scintillation  radiation 
detector  and  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  II  describes  the  GaAs  crystal  samples  and  the 
measurement  equipment  used  in  this  work.  Section  III  presents  experimental  results  and 
discussions  of  (1)  optical  emissions  during  optical  and  X-ray  excitation,  (2)  afterglow,  and  (3) 
thermally stimulated luminescence. Section IV gives the conclusions of this work. The appendix 
uses  previously  published  data  to  determine  the  minimum  room  temperature  free  carrier 
concentration  in  silicon-doped  GaAs  that  maintains  n-type  conductivity  at  temperatures 
approaching 0 K (i.e. the Mott transition). 

While this work focusses on the conversion of recoil electron energy into infrared photons, 
detection of those photons with high efficiency and low backgrounds at cryogenic temperatures 
is equally important. This technology is under active development using transition edge sensors 
[17] and microwave kinetic inductance detectors [18]. Another possibility is an optical absorber 
in  superfluid  helium.  The  heat  from  an  absorbed  1.33  eV  photon  should  produce  about  1000 
phonons  and  quasi-particles  that  will  evaporate  a  corresponding  number  of  helium  atoms  from 
the surface [12].

A. GaAs Samples 

Table I lists the GaAs samples used in the measurements. They are in the form of wafers with 
thicknesses from 0.35 to 0.60 mm. All samples have low electrical resistances at 10 K, consistent 
with doping above the Mott transition concentration of 8 x 1015 free carriers cm–3 (see Appendix).

The  exact  n-type  free  carrier  concentrations  cannot  be  easily  estimated  from  the  silicon  and

boron dopant concentrations, since both can occupy gallium and arsenic sites.

B. Cryostat 

Samples  were  cooled  with  an  ARS-2HW  helium  compressor  and  DE-202  two-stage  cold 
finger (both from Advanced Research Systems, Macungie, PA). The temperature was regulated 
with a Model 336 controller (Lake Shore Cryotronics, Westerville, OH).

C. Optically-excited Luminescence 

Optical  excitation  was  provided  by  a  Model  XS433  Xe  broad-spectrum  lamp  coupled  to  a 
Model SP2150i double grating monochromator (both from Acton Research Corp., Acton, MA). 
A split optical fiber sent light from the monochromator to the sample and to a silicon reference 
photodiode. The photodiode was used to calibrate the excitation monochromator for lamp aging 
and  for  the  wavelength-dependent  combined  output  of  the  lamp,  grating,  and  optical  fiber. 
Fluorescence spectra were measured using a double-grating SpectraPro-2150i spectrometer with 
order-sorting  filter  wheel  and  a  PIXIS:100B  thermoelectrically  cooled  charge  coupled  detector 
(silicon CCD) (both from Princeton Instruments, Inc., Trenton, NJ). A white Teflon reflector was 
used  to  calibrate  the  emission  spectrometer  for  variations  in  the  combined  response  of  the 
gratings, filters, and CCD as a function of wavelength. Samples were cooled using the cryostat 
described in section II.B.

D. X-ray-excited Luminescence and Afterglow 

The X-ray beam was produced by a Nonius FR591 water-cooled rotating copper-anode X-ray 
generator (50 kV, 60 mA) (Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI). The X-ray excited emission spectra, 
afterglow,  and  thermally  stimulated  emissions  were  measured  using  this  system,  the  emission 
spectrometer described in section II.C, and the cryostat described in section II.B.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

A. Optical excitation 

Figure  2  shows  the  emission  spectrum  (horizontal  axis)  of  sample  #13316  at  10K  as  a 
function of excitation wavelength (vertical axis). A very weak emission band peaking at 850 nm 
(1.46 eV) and a much stronger emission band peaking at 930 nm (1.33 eV) are observed. 

These emission bands are consistent with those reported in the literature. The emissions near 
850 nm have been identified as transitions from shallow silicon donors to shallow acceptors [16, 
19,  20],  and  the  emissions  near  930  nm  as  transitions  from  shallow  silicon  donors  to  boron 
acceptors on an arsenic site [16, 21]. Other emission bands centered near 1,050 nm and 1,300 nm 
(not presented in this work) have been associated with a gallium vacancy (VGa) bound to a donor 
[22]  and  a  (SiGaVGaSiGa)  complex  [23],  respectively.  See  [16]  for  a  recent  summary  of  the 
experimentally observed emissions, [24] for a discussion of the defects introduced by silicon and 
boron, and [20] for first-principles computations of their defect levels.

Figure  3  shows  the  optical  excitation  and  emission  curves  for  sample  #13316  at  10K.  The 
excitation peak  at 815 nm (1.52 eV) corresponds to the excitation of valence band  electrons to 
the conduction band. The excitation peak at 860 nm (1.44 eV) corresponds to the excitation of 
boron  acceptor  electrons  to  the  conduction  band.  The  emission  energy  of  1.33  eV  places  the 
unoccupied boron acceptor level 0.19 eV above the valence band maximum, in good agreement 
with  the  previously  measured  value  of  0.188  eV  [21].  The  Stokes  shift  between  the  lowest 
excitation energy peak and the emission peak is 0.11 eV. The overlap between the excitation and 
emission bands shows that photons with shorter wavelengths can be absorbed and re-emitted.

excitation at 10K. 

The  silicon  donor  ionization  energy  in  GaAs  is  2.3  meV  [25].  Since  boron  is  introduced 
during  the  growth  of  n-type  GaAs  crystals,  at  room  temperature  (kT  =  25  meV)  some  of  the 
silicon  donor  electrons  fill  the  boron  acceptor  sites  and  the  remainder  are  distributed  nearly 
equally between silicon atoms and the conduction band. The free carrier concentration for n-type 
GaAs is measured and reported under these conditions. On cooling to 0 K, free carriers below the 
Mott transition concentration bind to silicon atoms (i.e. are “frozen out”) and the rest remain in 
the conduction band. Consequently, the concentration of free carriers at 0 K is equal to the free 
carrier  concentration  at  room  temperature  minus  the  Mott  transition  concentration  (see 
Appendix). 

Figure 4(a) depicts the processes that occur when a 1.52 eV photon is absorbed: (1) A photon 
promotes a valence band electron into the conduction band, leaving a hole in the valence band, (2) 
a boron electron drops into the valence band hole, ionizing the boron, (3) the change in charge of 
the boron atom causes a lattice relaxation, (4) a donor electron combines with the ionized boron, 
producing a 1.33 eV photon. The radiative center could be an ionized boron acceptor and a single 
weakly  bound  donor  electron  (i.e.  an  exciton),  or  an  ionized  boron  acceptor  weakly  bound  to 
several equivalent donor electrons. Figure 4(b) depicts the processes that occur when a 1.44 eV 
photon is absorbed: (1) A photon promotes a boron electron into the conduction band followed 
by the previous processes (3) and (4). Not shown are mid-gap electron traps that are centers for 
non-radiative  recombination  [26].  As  described  in  [24]  boron  can  replace  gallium  as  an 
isoelectronic substitution or it can replace arsenic as an acceptor.

Figure 5 shows the emission spectrum of sample #13316 when excited with 50 keVp X-rays 
at 10 K. The X-ray excited emission band at 930 nm has almost the same shape as the optically-
excited  emission  band  in  Figure  3,  indicating  that  the  same  radiative  centers  are  excited.  The 
observed  luminosity  was  estimated  to be  about  43  photons/keV  by  calibrating  against  standard 
Bi4Ge3O12 and Lu2SiO5:Ce scintillation crystals of equal size mounted in the cryostat in the same 
way  and  correcting  for  the  wavelength-dependent  sensitivity  of  the  emission  spectrometer 
(described  in  section  II  C).  The  Bi4Ge3O12  and  Lu2SiO5:Ce  crystals  were  used  at  room 
temperature where their scintillation luminosities of 8 and 30 photons/keV, respectively, are well 
established  [27,  28].  The  value  of  43  photons/keV  for  sample  #13316  is  an  underestimate 
because  (1)  it  does  not  include  emissions  above  970  nm  and  (2)  the  higher refractive  index  of 
GaAs results in more internal trapping than the standards. The index of refraction is 3.45 at 930 
nm  [29]  and  anti-reflection  coatings  can  be  used to  reduce  internal  trapping  of the  scintillation 
light [30].

meV. We conclude that the latter value is the thermal barrier for the transfer of a hole from the 
boron acceptor to deeper traps [26].

Figure 6. Luminosity of sample #13316 in the 930 nm and 850 nm emission bands during 50 keVp X-ray excitation 
as a function of temperature. 

Table  II  lists  the  X-ray  excited  luminosity  for  the  seven  samples  used  in  this  work.  While 
there  is  a  weak  correlation  between  doping  levels  and  total  luminosity  of  the  AXT  and  the 
Freiberger  samples  taken  separately,  the  primary difference  is  that  the  AXT  samples  are  about 
five  times  more  luminous  than  the  Freiberger  samples.  The  lower  total  luminosity  of  the 
Freiberger  set  could  be  due  to  a  higher  concentration  of  deeper  impurity  levels  that  are  more 
efficient  than  boron  in  trapping  holes  [26],  or  could  be  due  to  the  higher  concentration  of 
phosphorous. In the Freiberger set the emission shifts from 930 nm to 850 nm as the free carrier 
concentration  is  increased  (e.g.  sample  #13330  vs.  #13333).  This  indicates  an  increased 
involvement  of  shallow  acceptor  defects  as  the  silicon  concentration  is  increased.  In  a  large 
crystal, an 850-nm photon would be absorbed and re-emitted into the 930-nm band (Figure 2). 

The X-rays used in this work produced recoil electrons with a maximum energy of 50 keV. 
The range of a 50 keV electron is about 0.01 gm/cm2, a value that is very weakly dependent on 
atomic  number [31].  In  GaAs  (density  5.32  gm/cm3)  this  corresponds  to  a range  of  about  0.02 
mm, which is much less than the thickness of the samples used in this work.

during, and after exposure to the 50 keVp X-ray beam. The beam shutter was manually opened 
from  300s  to  900s.  Since  the  closing  of  the  X-ray  shutter  was  not  synchronized  with  the  data 
acquisition, the point at 900 s could be an instrumental artifact.

D. Thermally Stimulated Luminescence 

Figure 8(a) shows the thermally stimulated luminescence from sample #13330 and crystals of 
Na(Tl), NaI, and CsI of similar size. The crystals were first excited with a 50 keVp X-ray beam 
for 30 minutes at 10K and then the emissions were recorded as the temperature was increased to 
450 K over a period of 50 minutes. The emission peaks appear at temperatures characteristic of 
the trap depths of metastable excited states. If the temperature were held at 10 K after excitation, 
these same traps would slowly release to produce an afterglow background as the system returns 
to  its  ground  state.  A  closer  look  at  the  GaAs  emission  curve  Figure  8(b)  shows  that  it  is 
indistinguishable 
of 
thermoluminescence in n-type GaAs can be explained by the annihilation of metastable radiative 
states  by  the  delocalized  conduction  band  electrons.  A  search  of  the  literature  found  only  one 
paper describing thermally stimulated luminescence from a conductive semiconductor [32]. This

This was later explained as the absorption of the UV exciting radiation (attenuation length 10–4 
mm) by a layer of non-conductive surface defects [33].

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

1)  Electron excitations >1.44 eV can produce 1.33 eV photons. 
2)  The  most  luminous  GaAs  sample  studied  (#13316)  has  an  observed  scintillation 
luminosity of 43 photons/keV, below the theoretical limit of about 200 photons/keV.  
3)  Ionization  from  background  radiation  (e.g.  muons  and  gamma  rays)  is  not  expected  to 
cause afterglow, provided that the free carrier concentration is above the Mott transition, 
where even near 0 K conduction band electrons are not frozen out and can annihilate any 
metastable radiative states 

These  measurements  show  that  n-type  GaAs  is  a  promising  cryogenic  scintillator  for  DM 
particle detection in the MeV/c2 mass range in that it can be grown as large, high-quality crystals, 
has good scintillation luminosity, a threshold sensitivity at the 1.52 eV bandgap, and potentially 
no  afterglow.  However,  more  work is  needed  to optimize  the  doping  concentrations, to  reduce 
hole  traps  that  compete  with  boron  acceptors,  and  to  develop  anti-reflective  coatings  and 
cryogenic  photodetectors.  The  n-type  free  carrier  concentration  must  be  high  enough  to 
efficiently combine with the boron acceptors and metastable radiative states but not so high as to 
introduce an unacceptable level of optical scattering and Auger quenching.

Appendix: The Mott transition in silicon-doped n-type GaAs 

Figure 9 shows the electrical conductivity at 0 K of silicon-doped n-type GaAs as a function 
of the free carrier concentration measured at 300 K. The data are 0 K extrapolations taken from 
[25]. The conductivity is zero below 8 x 1015 cm3 (the Mott transition) and rises linearly above 
that  value.  Below  the  Mott  transition  concentration,  cooling  from  room  temperature  to  0  K 
causes the free carriers to become bound to individual silicon atoms at an energy level 2.3 meV 
below  the  conduction  band  minimum  and  they  do  not  contribute  to  the  electrical  conductivity. 
Above  the  Mott  transition  concentration,  cooling  to  0  K  results  in  a  “metallic”  state  because 
mutual  repulsion  forces  the  additional  electrons  into  the  next  higher  available  energy  level, 
which  is  in  the  conduction  band.  At  0  K  only  the  electrons  forced  into  the  conduction  band 
contribute to the electrical conductivity and their concentration is equal to the room temperature 
carrier concentration minus the Mott transition concentration. 

Exceeding  the  Mott  transition  concentration  is  important  for  scintillation  at  0  K  because  it 
provides  highly  mobile  conduction  band  electrons  that  can  efficiently  combine  with  ionization 
holes trapped anywhere in the gap. This serves to maximize the prompt radiative emission (the 
desired signal), and to annihilate metastable radiative states that could cause unwanted afterglow. 
However,  an  excessive  free  carrier  concentration  is  not  desirable  because  of  increased  optical 
scattering and Auger quenching. 

It is interesting to note that both the donor ionization energy (2.3 meV) and Mott transition 
concentration (8 x 1015/cm3) are uniquely low for GaAs(Si) [25]. In contrast, these values are 13 
meV  and  3.5  x  1017/cm3  for  Ge(As)  [34];  30  meV  and  2  x  1018/cm3  for  CdS(Cl)  [35];  and  45 
meV and 3.7 x 1018/cm3 for Si(P) [36].

Figure 9. Electrical conductivity at 0 K as a function of the free carrier concentration at 300K, using data from 
[25]. When the room temperature free carrier concentration is below 8 x 1015 cm–3 (the Mott transition), cooling to 
0K  causes  the  carriers  to  be  bound  to  their  silicon  donor  atoms  (i.e.  they  are  “frozen  out”)  and  the  electrical 
conductivity  is  zero.  Above  the  Mott  transition,  additional  free  carriers  populate  the  conduction  band  and  the 
electrical conductivity rises in proportion to their concentration.
