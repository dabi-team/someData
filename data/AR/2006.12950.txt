Abstract

AR Scorpii is a compact binary system which consists of a magnetic white dwarf and an
M-type main sequence cool star. This binary system was discovered as a source of pulsat-
ing radiation in radio, infrared, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray wavebands. In this work, we
have analyzed the γ-ray data in the energy range 100 MeV to 500 GeV from the Fermi-
Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations for the period August 4, 2008 to March 31,
2019. The γ-ray emission from AR Scorpii over the last decade is not statistically signiﬁ-
cant and therefore 2σ upper limit on the integral ﬂux above 100 MeV has been estimated.
We reproduce the non-thermal broadband spectral energy distribution of AR Scorpii using
an emission model having two synchrotron components due to the relativistic electrons in
very high magnetic ﬁelds. The ﬁrst component (Synchrotron-1) broadly describes the emis-
sions at radio to high energy X-rays through the synchrotron radiation originating from a
103 Gauss.
spherical region of radius
The second component (Synchrotron-2) which reproduces the X-ray emission at lower en-
ergies and predicts the γ-ray emission, originates from another spherical region with radius
106 Gauss. The relativistic electron pop-
∼
ulations in both the emission regions are described by a smooth broken power law energy
distribution. The γ-ray emission predicted by the Synchrotron-2 model is below the broad-
band sensitivity of the Fermi-LAT and is also consistent with the 95% conﬁdence level
upper limit on the integral ﬂux above 100 MeV derived from more than 10 years of obser-
vations. According to our model, the binary system AR Scorpii could be a γ-ray source,
although its emission level must be below the current detection limit of the Fermi-LAT.

0.6M⊙ and radius of the order of 108 cm (

White dwarfs (WDs) are formed as the end products of the evolution of intermedi-
ate main sequence stars in the cores of red giant stars [1,2]. They are considered as
compact objects (electron-degenerate stellar conﬁgurations) with an average mass
Earth-size). WDs have therefore
of
a very high average density of 106 g cm−3 and a large surface gravity. They are
found as isolated objects or companions in various astrophysical binary systems
with compact objects (black hole, neutron star, or white dwarf), main sequence
stars, giant stars or ordinary stars. Isolated WDs are observed with very high sur-
face magnetic ﬁelds in the range 103 - 109 Gauss [3]. They are referred to as mag-
netic white dwarfs (MWDs) and emit at ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths.

The mass of MWDs (
magnetic WDs (
0.5M⊙) [3]. MWDs also exist in binary systems where they
strip or accrete material from a nearby companion star. For main sequence com-
panion stars, the accretion mainly occurs through Roche-lobe overﬂow whereas it
is driven by the stellar wind in the case of red giant stars [4]. The resulting mass
transfer from the main sequence companion stars to the MWDs produces atomic
lines and X-ray emissions from the MWD binary systems [5,6]. In a typical WD
binary system, the accreted matter heats up and forms a shock wave before settling
down on the surface of the WD. Under the assumption of a dipole magnetic ﬁeld,
a MWD would behave like a radio pulsar [7]. The radio pulsars like Crab, charac-
terized as the fast-rotating magnetized neutron stars, are assumed to be powered by
the spin-down energy loss due to the rotation or spinning of neutron star [8]. The
spin-down luminosity or rotational energy loss (Ldown) of the pulsar or MWD is
given by [9]

where M and R are the mass and radius of the WD respectively which are used
to deﬁne the moment of inertia as I = 2
5 MR2. P and ˙P are the spin period and
its time derivative respectively. The magnetic spin-down luminosity (Lmag) for a
magnetic dipole approximation of the MWD and assuming a wind outﬂow from
the magnetosphere, can be approximated as [10]

Lmag =

where Bs is the strength of the surface magnetic ﬁeld at the polar cap and c is
the speed of light in vacuum. If the magnetic dipole losses of the WD dominate
the luminosity of a binary system, the strength of the surface magnetic ﬁeld of the
MWD at the polar cap is related to the different parameters of the pulsar as [10]

The magnetic ﬁeld strength at the light cylinder (BLC) is approximated as

(5)

Therefore, a precise measurement of P and ˙P is very important to derive the en-
ergetics of a pulsar or spinning MWD. BLC plays a very crucial role for the γ-ray
emission from these sources due to the conversion of a signiﬁcant fraction of the
spin-down power (Ldown) to γ-ray luminosity.

The binary systems comprising the MWDs and main sequence stars are divided
into two classes namely polar and intermediate polar depending on the strength of
the surface magnetic ﬁeld of the WD. For polar type, the surface magnetic ﬁeld
(Bs) is higher than 107 Gauss and accretion from the companion star is completely
conﬁned through the magnetic ﬁeld of the WD [11]. In the case of intermediate
polar class, Bs is in the range 103 - 106 Gauss and the accretion process is par-
tially channeled through the surface magnetic ﬁeld [12]. Due to the stronger sur-
face magnetic ﬁelds, the rotation of the two stars is synchronised in the polar binary
systems. Whereas, in the intermediate polar systems, the rotation of the WD is not
synchronised with the companion star and the spin period of the WD is shorter than
the orbital period. The formation of an accretion disk around the WD is prevented
in the polar binary systems because of the synchronised rotation of the two stars
and no angular momentum of the accreting matter with respect to the WD. But,
an accretion disk can be formed in the intermediate polar systems and the transfer
of angular momentum from the accreting matter may spin up the WD [13]. The
accretion ﬂows in polars and intermediate polars lead to the formation of funnels
and curtains respectively. The differential rotation of gaseous matter leaking out
from the companion star along a circular Keplerian orbit leads to a viscous rubbing
of ﬂuid elements at varying distances and causes the accretion disk to heat up. A
sufﬁciently hot accretion disk emits radiation from optical, ultraviolet to X-rays.
The surface magnetic ﬁeld in the intermediate polar disrupts the inner part of the
accretion disk and the accreting matter along the magnetic ﬁeld lines [13]. This
leads to the formation of one or more accretion columns near the magnetic poles
which emit non-thermal polarized radiation from radio to X-rays. The variations in
the non-thermal emissions from the intermediate polar binary systems are strongly
modulated on the spin period (P ) of the MWD and its harmonics [14]. However,
the exact physical process involved in the non-thermal broadband emission from
the WD binary systems has not been clearly understood and is being widely de-
bated. In this work, we model the time averaged broadband spectral energy dis-
tribution (SED) of an intermediate polar AR Scorpii using observations spanned
over last two decades. In Section 2, we present a brief description of the important

3

observational features so far of AR Scorpii. The details of the broadband data set
used in the present work are given in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the results
from the multi-wavelength emission from the binary system AR Scorpii. Finally,
we conclude the study in Section 5.

suggests that the R-band optical magnitude changes from 16.9 (faintest) to 13.6
(brightest) on a time period of
3.56 hours. The amplitude spectra corresponding
to the ultraviolet, optical, infrared and radio (9 GHz) ﬂuxes show signals having
two components, which are identiﬁed as the spin frequency (νs = P −1) and beat
frequency (νb = νs −
is the orbital frequency). The beat com-
o
ponent of the signal is stronger and therefore it deﬁnes the dominant pulsation at a
beat period of Pb = 1.97 minutes and its harmonics [14]. The observations of AR
Scorpii over a wide wavelength range from radio to ultraviolet show strong double-
humped pulsations with the pulse fractions between 10% to 95% [14]. The optical
spectra of M-type cool main sequence star with absorption lines suggest that the
radial velocity of the companion star in AR Scorpii varies sinusoidally with a time
290 km s−1 [14]. The MWD in AR

The MWD in AR Scorpii is spinning down on a characteristic timescale of

nent of the X-ray emission [15]. The observed optical emission from AR Scorpii
modulating with the beat frequency of the binary system is highly polarized with
a degree of linear polarization up to 40% and a low level of circular polarization
of less than 5% [16,17]. The degree of linear polarization evolves with the orbital
phase and varies on both the beat frequency of the binary system and spin frequency
of the MWD. The observed characteristics of the degree of linear polarization are
similar to that of the well-known spin-powered Crab pulsar. The radio observations
at 8.5 GHz reveal the compactness of the emission region and conﬁrm the identity
of AR Scorpii as a point Galactic source [18]. The high resolution interferometric
radio imaging of AR Scorpii indicates a strong modulation of the radio ﬂux on the
orbital and beat periods and the radio emission exhibits a weak linear polarization
and very strong circular polarization [19]. High temporal resolution spectroscopy
of this MWD binary system shows a complex structure of the Hα emission lines
as observed from some polars in the quiescent state [20]. The aforementioned mea-
surements/results suggest a non-thermal origin of the broadband radiation from AR
Scorpii through the synchrotron emission process.

3 Broadband Data Set

In this work, we use archival results from the radio, infrared, ultraviolet, optical
and X-ray observations of AR Scorpii available so far in the literature [14,15]. We
have also analyzed data from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations
for a period of more than 10 years to search for γ-ray emission from AR Scorpii.
A brief description of the broadband archival data as well as a detailed analysis of
the Fermi-LAT data are given below.

3.1 Archival Data

We have obtained the spectral archival points at radio, infrared, ultraviolet, opti-
cal and X-ray energies from Figure 4 of Marsh et al. (2016) [14] and Figure 10 of
Takata et al. (2018) [15]. These ﬂux measurements in different wavebands include
observations from a number of ground and space-based instruments during the pe-
riod 2006-2016. The X-ray ﬂux points correspond to the time averaged spectrum in
the energy range 0.15-12 keV from the XMM-Newton observations of AR Scorpii
on September 19, 2016. The XMM-Newton observation covers more than two or-
bits of AR Scorpii and the X-ray emission shows a large variation over the orbit. A
detailed description of the XMM-Newton data can be found in [15].

3.2 Fermi-LAT Data

The Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite is a pair-conversion
detector to measure the energy, arrival time, and direction of the γ-ray photons
in the energy range 30 MeV to more than 1 TeV [21]. It also detects the intense
cosmic ray background of the charged particles and radiation trapped at the orbit
of the satellite. For γ-ray photons at 1 GeV energy, the Fermi-LAT has an effective
1 m2 at normal incidence, a wide ﬁeld of view of 2.4 steradians
collection area of
(20% of the sky), and an angular resolution of 0.8◦. At lower energies, the photon
5◦ at 0.1 GeV) and it improves with the increase in
angular resolution is poor (
0.1◦ above 10 GeV). Therefore, the angular resolution of the Fermi-
energy (
LAT can be approximated as a power law function of energy (E−0.8, where E is the
energy of the γ-ray photon) in its operational energy range. The whole sky coverage
is provided by the Fermi-LAT every three hours in survey mode of its operation.

In this work, we have extracted the Pass 8 Release 3 (P8R3) data for the posi-
tion of AR Scorpii (RA: 16h21m47.28s, Dec: -22◦53′10.39′′) collected through the
last decade by the Fermi-LAT during August 4, 2008 to March 31, 2019 (MJD
54682-58573) from the Fermi Science Support Centre 1 . The data is processed us-
ing standard Fermi Science Tools software version 1.0.1 (Fermi 1.0.1). We have
considered only SOURCE class events (evclass = 128, evtype = 3) correspond-
ing to the P 8R3 SOURCE V 6 instrument response function detected within a
circular region of interest (ROI) of 10◦ radius centred on the position of AR Scorpii
for the above period in the energy range 100 MeV to 500 GeV using the gtselect
tool. In addition, a maximum zenith angle cut of 90◦ is applied to avoid the albedo
contamination from the Earth limb γ-rays while creating the good time intervals.
We have used unbinned maximum-likelihood technique implemented in the gtlike
tool to further analyse the dataset. A background model is generated using all the
sources reported in the fourth Fermi gamma-ray catalog (4FGL) [22] and recent
Galactic diffuse and extragalactic isotropic background emission templates. All the
4FGL point sources present within the ROI are included in the model ﬁle for back-
ground subtraction keeping their spectral forms the same as deﬁned in the 4FGL
catalog [22]. Since the target source AR Scorpii is not reported in the 4FGL cat-
alog, we have manually added this source in the model ﬁle with a spectral shape
deﬁned by a simple power law function. We use an iterative method to optimize the
contribution of sources in the background model ﬁle. The associated spectral pa-
rameters of all the sources within the ROI including AR Scorpii are left free to vary
during the unbinned likelihood ﬁtting. The signiﬁcance of γ-ray signal is estimated
from the maximum-likelihood test statistic (TS: square-root of TS gives the sta-
tistical signiﬁcance) as deﬁned in [23]. After every ﬁt, we remove the background
sources from the model ﬁle corresponding to a value of TS<25 (statistical signif-
5σ) and the process is repeated until we get all the background sources

4 Results and Discussion

4.1 Search for γ-ray emission from AR Scorpii

The Pass 8 dataset from the Fermi-LAT observations provides a better measurement
of the energy of γ-ray events over a wider energy range with their improved recon-
struction and a signiﬁcant increase in the effective area at lower energies. From
the unbinned-likelihood ﬁtting as described above, we observe that the Fermi-LAT
data collected in the direction of AR Scorpii for a period of more than ten years
assuming a power law spectral index of -2.7 in the energy range of 100 MeV-500
GeV, exhibit a TS value of 8. This implies that the γ-ray emission from AR Scorpii
integrated over a decade from the Fermi-LAT observations is not statistically sig-

7

 
 
 
 
 
×

niﬁcant (<3σ) and the ratio of the error in the integral ﬂux to the absolute value
10−12
is more than 0.5. Therefore, we have estimated the 2σ upper limit of 2.27
erg cm−2 s−1 on the integral energy ﬂux above 100 MeV for the γ-ray emission
from the binary system AR Scorpii. The low statistical signiﬁcance of the γ-ray
observation from AR Scorpii is consistent with the fact that this source is not re-
ported in the latest 4FGL catalog which includes more than 5000 sources above 4σ
signiﬁcance [22]. We have also generated the yearly light curve for AR Scorpii to
observe any temporal ﬂuctuation in the γ-ray emission from this source. The one
year binned light curve of AR Scorpii in the energy range 100 MeV to 500 GeV
is shown in Figure 1. All the ﬂux points in the light curve (Figure 1) correspond
to the 2σ upper limit on the integral ﬂux. This indicates that AR Scorpii is not a
γ-ray source above the current detection sensitivity of the Fermi-LAT. The Galactic
diffuse emission is bright in the MeV-GeV energy regime and provides a dominant
contribution to the background radiation near the Galactic plane. Due to a relatively
broad angular resolution of the Fermi-LAT at lower energies, the emission from a
faint γ-ray source like AR Scorpii may be contaminated by the diffuse background
or photons from the nearby sources. This can affect the search for a pulsed signal
from the weak γ-ray sources. An event weighting technique can be used to search
for a pulsation from a faint γ-ray source [24]. The search for pulsed γ-ray signal
from the WD binary system AR Scorpii is beyond the scope of this work.

4.2 Broadband Spectral Energy Distribution Modelling

We have employed a leptonic synchrotron model with two emission components
to reproduce the time averaged broadband SED of the binary system AR Scorpii.
We assume that the non-thermal radiation from AR Scorpii is produced by the
population of relativistic electrons through the synchrotron emission. The electron
energy distribution is described by a smooth broken-power law of the form

maximum energies of the electrons respectively. The synchrotron emissivity due to

of radius Rem ﬁlled with the relativistic electrons deﬁned by Equation 6 and per-
meated in a tangled magnetic ﬁeld of strength B, we have reproduced the time av-
eraged broadband SED of AR Scorpii. The model curves along with the data points
in different wavebands are shown in Figure 2. We observe that the time averaged
broadband emission from the binary system AR Scorpii can be broadly reproduced
by two non-thermal components referred to as Synchrotron-1 and Synchrotron-
2. The multi-wavelength data points in Figure 2 have been used without taking
into account the measurement errors from different instruments and are reproc-
duced through the χ-by-eye ﬁtting process. It is evident from Figure 2 that the
Synchrotron-1 component of the model describes the emission in the low energy
band (radio-IR-Optical-UV), whereas the Synchrotron-2 component predicts soft
X-ray and γ-ray emissions from the binary system AR Scorpii. The high energy
end of the X-ray emission (hard X-rays) in the energy range 0.15-12 keV is repro-
duced by the tail of the synchrotron spectrum from the Synchrotron-1 component of
the model. A comparison of the γ-ray emission level predicted by the Synchrotron-
2 model with the broadband ﬂux sensitivity of the Fermi-LAT in Figure 2 suggests
that the γ-ray ﬂux above 100 MeV expected from AR Scorpii is below the current
detection sensitivity of the LAT as well as the 2σ upper limit on the integral ﬂux
derived from more than 10 years of observations. The best ﬁt model parameters
derived from the non-thermal broadband SED modelling of AR Scorpii are given
in Table 1. We note that the size of the emission region (Rem) for the Synchrotron-
1 and Synchrotron-2 components is much smaller than the light cylinder radius
(RLC) of the MWD and/or the binary separation (a) in AR Scorpii. This implies
that the non-thermal emission zones are situated well inside the light cylinder. The
magnetic ﬁeld strength in the X-ray and γ-ray emission regions (Synchrotron-2)
is much higher than that in the low energy emission zone (Synchrotron-1). How-
ever, the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld in both the emission regions is signiﬁcantly
less than the surface magnetic ﬁeld (Bs) of the MWD in AR Scorpii. The dipole
magnetic ﬁeld of the MWD at a radial distance x is given by

From Table 1, we ﬁnd that the energy density of the electrons in the high energy
emission zone (Synchrotron-2) is about 5 times higher than that in the low en-
ergy emission region (Synchrotron-1). This indicates that the electrons associated
with the Synchrotron-2 component are accelerated to higher relativistic energies
106) than those involved in the Synchrotron-1 component. Therefore,
(γmax ∼
electrons near to the MWD experience relatively more acceleration as compared to
the far away electrons. The values of p and q for both the emission components are
very close to the condition of radiative cooling break q = p + 1. The synchrotron
cooling time scale for an electron is deﬁned as [27]

If the maximum energy of an electron in the emission region is determined by
the synchrotron cooling, the acceleration timescale should be the same as tsync.
Therefore, assuming γ = γmax, the acceleration timescale of an electron in AR
Scorpii can be expressed as

Using the values of B and γmax from Table 1, we ﬁnd that tacc is very small and
therefore, suggests a very fast and efﬁcient acceleration of electrons in AR Scorpii.
The exact acceleration process for the electrons in the WD binary systems remains
unclear. However, several plausible scenarios have been proposed for AR Scorpii.
In the ﬁrst scenario [28], a magnetized plasma ejected from the polar cap of the
MWD sweeps the stellar wind from the M-type companion star and interaction be-
tween the plasma and stellar wind leads to the formation of a bow shock. This bow
shock propagates in the stellar wind and accelerates the electrons to relativistic en-
ergies in the wind to produce synchrotron radiation. In the second scenario [29], the
magnetic interaction on the surface of the M-type companion star has three dissi-
pation effects namely heating of the surface of M-star, an overﬂow from the M-star
and acceleration of electrons to the relativistic energies with γ = 50-100. The ac-

celerated electrons move from the companion star to the surface of the MWD along
the magnetic ﬁeld lines and are trapped in the closed magnetic ﬁeld lines region due
to the magnetic mirror effect. The synchrotron radiation is produced by the trapped
electrons at the magnetic mirror point. In the third scenario [30], the particles are
accelerated through the magnetic reconnection or Fermi acceleration process in a
turbulent collision region produced by the interaction of the MWD magnetic ﬁeld
with a dense atmosphere of the M-type star. In a relatively different hybrid scenario
[31], electrons and protons are accelerated to the relativistic energies close to the
surface of the companion M-star as postulated in the third scenario and the broad-
band non-thermal emission is produced by the relativistic electrons and/or by the
electron-positron pairs from the pion decay created by the interaction of relativistic
protons with the matter in the atmosphere of the M-star. Under the framework of
the bow shock acceleration, the electron energy distribution has been reasonably
2.4 and q = p + 1 constrained by
described by a broken-power law with p
the X-ray observations [28]. The measurements of the optical linear polarization
from AR Scorpii support the bow shock acceleration of electrons [16]. Therefore,
the electron energy distribution described by a smooth broken-power law in the
present study can be attributed to the bow shock acceleration scenario.

However, from Figure 2, we observe that a hump at the optical frequencies cannot
be reproduced by the non-thermal synchrotron emission predicted by the Synchrotron-
1 model. Therefore, we use a simple black body emission to model this optical
emission from AR Scorpii. The spectral energy distribution for a thermal emission
from a black body is estimated as

where Rb and Tb are the radius and temperature of the black body respectively. h
and k are the Planck and Boltzmann constants respectively. From the best ﬁt of the
1010 cm and Tb = 3100 K. These pa-
optical hump in Figure 2, we get Rb = 3.2
rameters are in good agreement with the values reported in the literature [14,15,28].
Hence, the black body can be associated with the companion M-type star in AR
Scorpii. This supports the above ﬁnding that the Synchrotron-1 emission zone is
near to the M-star in the binary system. Therefore, the thermal emission from the
M-type star dominates over the synchrotron radiation at the optical frequencies.
The dominant thermal emission from the M-type star can play a major role in the
depolarization of the synchrotron radition at the optical wavelengths. Therefore,
the thermal contribution of the M-type star should be taken into account while
modelling the synchrotron polarization of the source. The intrinsic synchrotron po-
larization modelling will help to better understand the acceleration process in AR
Scorpii.

5 Conclusions

We have used the broadband archival data from radio to X-ray observations to re-
produce the time averaged spectral energy distribution of the binary system AR
Scorpii under the framework of a leptonic emission model. We have also derived a
2σ upper limit on the γ-ray integral ﬂux above 100 MeV by analysing the Fermi-
LAT data for a period of more than a dacade. The important ﬁndings of this study
are as follows:

The synchrotron emission produced by the relativistic electrons described by a
smooth broken-power law energy distribution from two independent components
located well inside the light cylinder of the MWD contributes to the observed
broadband SED of AR Scorpii.
Low energy observations in the radio, infrared, optical and ultraviolet frequency
bands are broadly reproduced by the non-thermal emission which originates
from a spherical region near the M-type companion star. In this region, we ﬁnd
103 G and the electron energy distri-
that the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld is
bution is decribed by the spectral indices 2.3 and 3.7 before and after the break
respectively with a break energy of
Most of the X-ray ﬂux points in the energy range 0.15-12 keV are reproduced by
the synchrotron emission from a spherical zone with a magnetic ﬁeld strength of
109 cm from the MWD. The relativistic
∼
electrons in this region also follow an energy distribution with spectral indices
1.8 and 3.4 before and after the break respectively and having a break at
715
MeV. The ﬂux points at the high energy end of the X-ray spectra are described
by the tail of the synchrotron radiation which is dominant at the low energy
component of the broadband SED of AR Scorpii.
The measured optical emission from AR Scorpii indicates a hump in the broad-

106 G and located at a distance of

200 MeV.

band SED and cannot be modelled by any of the non-thermal emission compo-
nents. Instead, the optical hump is well reproduced by a black body spectrum
associated with the M-type companion star in the binary system.
The high energy γ-ray emission level predicted by the SED modelling of the
source is below the 2σ upper limit on the integral energy ﬂux above 100 MeV
as well as the current broadband ﬂux sensitivity of the Fermi-LAT. This suggests
that if the binary system AR Scorpii emits gamma rays, it would be a weak
Galactic source, but we cannot make an implicit assumption that it is. However,
it can be a potential target for the upcoming ground-based γ-ray observatory
namely the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) with a low energy threshold and
better sensitivity.
