ABSTRACT

Context. The tilt of solar active regions described by Joy’s law is essential for converting a toroidal ﬁeld to a poloidal ﬁeld in Babcock-
Leighton dynamo models. In thin ﬂux tube models the Coriolis force causes what we observe as Joy’s law, acting on east-west ﬂows
as they rise towards the surface.
Aims. Our goal is to measure the evolution of the average tilt angle of hundreds of active regions as they emerge, so that we can
constrain the origins of Joy’s law.
Methods. We measured the tilt angle of the primary bipoles in 153 emerging active regions (EARs) in the Solar Dynamics Observatory
Helioseismic Emerging Active Region (SDO/HEAR) survey. We used line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld measurements averaged over
6 hours to deﬁne the polarities and measure the tilt angle up to four days after emergence.
Results. We ﬁnd that at the time of emergence the polarities are on average aligned east-west, and that neither the separation nor
the tilt depends on latitude. We do ﬁnd, however, that EARs at higher latitudes have a faster north-south separation speed than those
closer to the equator at the emergence time. After emergence, the tilt angle increases and Joy’s law is evident about two days later.
The scatter in the tilt angle is independent of ﬂux until about one day after emergence, when we ﬁnd that higher-ﬂux regions have a
smaller scatter in tilt angle than lower-ﬂux regions.
Conclusions. Our ﬁnding that active regions emerge with an east-west alignment is consistent with earlier observations, but is still
surprising since thin ﬂux tube models predict that tilt angles of rising ﬂux tubes are generated below the surface. Previously reported
tilt angle relaxation of deeply anchored ﬂux tubes can be largely explained by the change in east-west separation. We conclude that
Joy’s law is caused by an inherent north-south separation speed present when the ﬂux ﬁrst reaches the surface, and that the scatter in
the tilt angle is consistent with buﬀeting of the polarities by supergranulation.

1. Introduction

There are two well-known constraints for dynamo models from
early studies of ﬂux emergence: Hale’s law, which tells us that
the magnetic bipoles of larger active regions that emerge in the
northern and southern hemispheres have opposite polarities, and
Joy’s law, which describes the observed statistical tendency of
the leading polarity of an active region to be closer to the equator
than the following polarity (Hale et al. 1919). This tilt angle be-
tween the leading and following polarities tends to increase with
unsigned latitude (e.g. van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015 and
references therein), and plays an essential role in the Babcock-
Leighton dynamo model (Babcock 1961; Cameron & Sch¨ussler
2015; Karak & Miesch 2017).

Given the increase in tilt angle with latitude, the physical
cause of Joy’s law is believed to lie in the Coriolis force. This
immediately raises the question: Upon what motions does the
Coriolis force act? One possibility is the motion associated with
the buoyant rise of the magnetic ﬂux tube through the solar con-
vection zone (e.g. Wang & Sheeley 1991; D’Silva & Choudhuri
1993; Fisher et al. 1995; Weber et al. 2011). An alternative possi-
bility is the motion of the turbulent convection (e.g. Parker 1955;
Choudhuri & D’Silva 1990; Brandenburg 2005), with Schmidt

(1968) having suggested that active region bipoles emerge in
upwelling supergranular cells with an east-west orientation, and
that the surface ﬂows in the cell move the polarities outwards,
away from one another.

Apart from the question of the motions involved in produc-
ing Joy’s law, there is the question of what causes the large ob-
served scatter in the tilt angle (Joy’s law is a statistical tendency
with large variations between individual active regions). This
scatter has been found to be smaller for active regions with a
higher ﬂux (e.g. Jiang et al. 2014). This could be due to the sur-
face polarities with lower ﬂux being more susceptible to buﬀet-
ing by the convection (e.g. Fan et al. 1994; Longcope & Fisher
1996; Weber et al. 2011), or, as suggested in Schunker et al.
(2019), the measurement of the position of larger polarities (with
higher ﬂux) has less scatter because the centre of gravity is not
as aﬀected by the buﬀeting by convection.

Traditionally, Joy’s law has been measured from contin-
uum intensity images of sunspots (e.g. McClintock & Norton
2016). The measured tilt angles are therefore of mostly well-
established, stable active regions. To understand the origin of
active region tilt angles it is therefore necessary to use magnetic
ﬁeld observations to capture the very beginnings of the emer-

gence process, and to follow the evolution as a function of active
region lifetime.

Observations from monitoring instruments such as the
Michelson Doppler Imager on board the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO/MDI;
Scherrer et al. 1995) and the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO/HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) make it possible
to capture the emergence process of active regions both in inten-
sity and magnetic ﬁeld observations (e.g. Kosovichev & Stenﬂo
2008; McClintock & Norton 2016).

Kosovichev & Stenﬂo (2008) studied more than 700 bipo-
lar active regions using SOHO/MDI 96-minute cadence mag-
netic ﬁeld observations, and found that the tilt angle of active
regions at the time of emergence was statistically zero, and that
the tilt angle is established during the emergence process (which
lasts about 1-1.5 days). In one case study using heliosesimology
to measure subsurface ﬂows, Gonz´alez Hern´andez et al. (2013)
showed that the direction of subsurface vortical ﬂows below an
anti-Joy’s law active region (AR11073) is consistent with driv-
ing the leading polarity away from the equator. The advantage
of using SDO/HMI is that it has observed hundreds of relatively
simple active region emergence processes.

In this paper we present the statistical evolution of the tilt
angle of 153 emerging active region (EAR) polarities from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic Emerging Active
Region (SDO/HEAR) survey (Schunker et al. 2016, 2019) in
an eﬀort to understand the origins of Joy’s law. Using the
SDO/HEAR survey, Schunker et al. (2019) identiﬁed two dis-
tinct phases of emergence. In phase 1 the speed of the separation
between the polarities increases starting when the bipole ﬁrst ap-
pears at the surface, and lasts until about 0.5 days after the time
of emergence. Phase 2 then begins when the speed of the sepa-
ration starts to decrease and lasts until about two days after the
emergence time when the polarities stop separating. We follow
the evolution of the tilt angle in relation to these phases, and
as a function of latitude to characterise Joy’s law. Birch et al.
(2016) found by averaging over the emerging active regions in
the SDO/HEAR survey that there are no signiﬁcant outﬂows dur-
ing emergence, although these surface outﬂows are predicted by
thin ﬂux tube theory. Birch et al. (2019) did, however, ﬁnd an av-
erage east-west elongated prograde ﬂow just prior to emergence.
We now turn our attention to the evolution of the tilt angle and
Joy’s law.

First, in Sect. 2, we brieﬂy describe how we measure the tilt
angle of polarity pairs in emerging active regions from measure-
ments in the SDO/HEAR survey. We then show the evolution of
the tilt angle and the scatter in the tilt angle as a function of time
and ﬂux in Sects. 3 and 4. In Sect. 5 we show the north-south
separation, east-west separation, and tilt angle as a function of
latitude at the time of emergence and two days later. We discuss
the change in tilt angle with latitude in relation to what we would
expect from the Coriolis eﬀect in Sect. 6. In Sect. 7 we explain
how the apparent tilt angle relaxation can be largely reproduced
by the change in east-west separation. We summarise our results
in Sect. 8 and discuss the models we think are useful to describe
Joy’s law.

2. Measuring the tilt angle of the polarities

We computed the tilt angle of the polarities in 153 active re-
gions from measurements of the location of the polarities as de-
scribed in Schunker et al. (2019). The algorithm used in this pa-
per was slightly modiﬁed from the previous measurements. We
summarise the relevant details below.

2

The SDO/HEAR survey (Schunker et al. 2016) consists
of 182 emerging active regions observed by SDO/HMI be-
tween May 2010 and July 2014. The 716 × 716 Mm (512 ×
512 pixel) Postel-projected maps of the SDO/HMI line-of-sight
magnetic ﬁeld are centred on the active region and tracked at the
Carrington rotation rate up to seven days before and after the
emergence. We are interested in the evolution of the active re-
gions on timescales of a fraction of a day. For helioseismology
purposes the data is divided into 6.825-hour datacubes, and are
labelled with a time interval (TI) relative to the emergence time
( TI+00). We retained these time intervals for consistency and
convenience and averaged the line-of-sight magnetogram maps
over this time interval. Table B.1 in Schunker et al. (2019) lists
the mid-time of the averaged TI to the time of emergence, τ = 0,
for each time interval label. They measured the position of the
polarities in each of these averaged line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld
maps using a feature recognition algorithm designed to deter-
mine the centroid position of the primary opposite polarities.
The averaged line-of-sight magnetogram map was ﬁrst shifted
so that the centre of the map coincides with the centre of the
active region (as deﬁned by Birch et al. 2013). This was done
using bilinear interpolation using the four nearest pixels which
sometimes aﬀected the identiﬁed location of the polarities, par-
ticularly in the more dispersed, following polarity at later times
(see Appendix A). In this paper we ﬁrst identify the locations of
the polarities without shifting the maps, and then compute the
locations relative to the active region centre. This procedure in-
troduced diﬀerences in locations for some individual AR but this
change does not aﬀect the previous results presented in Schunker
et al. (2019). Appendix A shows an example of the diﬀerences
in position of the polarities for an individual active region and
the resulting average position of the polarities.

Waves used for helioseismology are sensitive to scales larger
than a few megametres, but to measure the location of the po-
larities it might be necessary to have a higher resolution. In
Appendix B we show that the resolution of the maps does not
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the average positions of the polarities or the
tilt angle.

As in Schunker et al. (2019) we excluded 29 active regions
where it was diﬃcult to track the locations of the polarities cor-
rectly, or where the active regions have sustained anti-Hale ori-
entation (see Appendix 2 in Schunker et al. 2019). Our statistical
analysis of the tilt angles was based on the remaining 153 EARs.
In Schunker et al. (2019), active regions in the southern
hemisphere had their polarities inverted, so that they had a neg-
ative leading polarity and a positive following polarity as for
northern hemisphere regions, and were ﬂipped in the latitudinal
direction to account for Joy’s law. Then the separation between
the polarities in the y-direction, δy(τ) = yl(τ) − yf(τ), is negative
(positive) when the leading polarity, yl, is closer to (further from)
the equator than the following polarity, yf. The separation in the
x-direction, δx(τ) = xl(τ) − xf(τ), is deﬁned as positive (neg-
ative) when the leading polarity is in the prograde (retrograde)
direction from the following polarity. From these measurements
in Schunker et al. (2019), we deﬁne the tilt angle as

γ(τ) = arctan

The tilt angle is positive when the leading polarity is closer to the
equator (and negative when it is further from the equator) than
the following polarity (see Fig. 1).

4. Scatter of the tilt angle as a function of time and

ﬂux

We found that on average the tilt angle increases as an active
region emerges, but the evolution of the average tilt angle it-
self is not dependent on the maximum ﬂux of the active region.
Measuring the scatter in the tilt angle will help us to understand
what causes the deviations from Joy’s law.

We found that the scatter in the tilt angle at the emergence
time (when the active regions are small and close together) is
large, 25 ± 2◦, and decreases, to about 20 ± 1◦, over the ﬁrst day
after emergence (bottom panel Fig. 2). This is consistent with
previous observations showing that there is less scatter in the
tilt angle of high-ﬂux regions (e.g. Stenﬂo & Kosovichev 2012;
Jiang et al. 2014), and demonstrates that the evolutionary stage
of the active region is an important factor when characterising
the tilt angle.

Schunker et al. (2019) showed that the scatter in the motion
of the polarities is largely independent of ﬂux, but that the scatter
increases with time and that the scatter of the leading polarity is
systematically larger than the following polarity. The following
polarity is known to be more diﬀuse than the leading polarity,
and Schunker et al. (2019) argued that both polarities are buf-
feted equally by supergranulation, but that the centre of gravity
of the following polarity is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by buﬀet-
ing at its edges. From this argument, larger, higher-ﬂux regions
would be expected to have less scatter in their tilt angles due
to their larger size, and not a stronger resistance to buﬀeting by
convection. In the bottom panel of Fig. 2 we show that this is
true after about one day after emergence. The scatter in the tilt
angle for higher-ﬂux regions remains roughly constant after this.
However, the scatter in lower-ﬂux regions continues to increase;
this is probably due to the short lifetimes and decay of weak
active regions (e.g. Schunker et al. 2016).

5. Tilt angle and separation as a function of latitude

Joy’s law states that the average tilt angle of active region po-
larities increases with latitude, for example as measured by
Wang & Sheeley (1991) from line-of-sight magnetograms as
sin γ = 0.48 sin λ + 0.03 where λ is unsigned latitude. To reﬂect
this deﬁnition, we multiplied the north-south displacement and
the tilt angle by the sign of the latitude of the active region for
the remaining analysis, sgn(λ)γ and sgn(λ)δy. Therefore, active
regions that obey Joy’s law will have a negative tilt angle and
positive north-south displacement in the southern hemisphere.

We examined the longitudinal and latitudinal separation, as
well as the tilt angle of the polarities as a function of latitude.
Figure 3 (left) shows that at the emergence time, TI+00, the ac-
tive regions have an east-west separation of about 20.3±0.6 Mm,
a north-south separation of −1.1 ± 0.7 Mm, and a small tilt an-
gle of about 1.8 ± 2.2◦ (recalling that there is already observable
ﬂux at the surface at this time). As expected from Schunker et al.
(2019), low-ﬂux regions tend to be closer together than large ﬂux
regions. Joy’s law is not evident because neither the separation
nor the tilt angle varies signiﬁcantly from the mean. This is not
consistent with thin ﬂux tube simulations, where the ﬂux tubes
are tilted by the latitudinally dependent Coriolis eﬀect acting as
the tubes rise to the surface (e.g. Weber et al. 2011). These sim-
ulations are valid in the regions where convection is relatively
weak, and so in the remaining rise through the convection to-
wards the surface this tilt angle would have to be somehow un-
done or hidden to accommodate the observations. However, the
east-west orientation is consistent with the surface activity repre-

itive tilt angle in the northern hemisphere during solar cycle 24
where the leading negative polarity is closer to the equator than
the following positive polarity.

3. Tilt angle as a function of active region evolution

Understanding the origin and evolution of the tilt angle, as well
as the dependence of the tilt angle on ﬂux will constrain mod-
els of active region emergence, and the location of the global
toroidal magnetic ﬁeld.

We averaged the tilt angle over all valid active regions at each
time step, as well as over regions with a maximum ﬂux higher
than or equal to, and lower than the median 4.6 × 1021 Mx. In
Table A.1 of Schunker et al. (2019) active regions with a max-
imum ﬂux value higher than or equal to the median of the 105
active regions used in Schunker et al. (2016) have an asterisk.
However, here we use the median value of the 153 valid active
regions used in this paper. We found that at the time of emer-
gence the tilt angle is small, 1.8 ± 2.2◦(Fig. 2, top panel) and
then increases over the course of the following day, after which
it remains constant within the uncertainties. This excludes a con-
stant tilt angle model, consistent with Fig. 2 in Schunker et al.
(2019). This ﬁgure also shows that there is no signiﬁcant depen-
dence of the tilt angle on ﬂux.

Fisher et al. (1995) found that at a ﬁxed latitude, the tilt an-
gle of white-light sunspot groups is smaller for polarities that
are closer together, and hence have lower ﬂux (Wang & Sheeley
1989; Howard 1992). However, we have shown that, within the
errors, the tilt angle (and north-south separation) does not de-
pend on the eventual maximum ﬂux of the active region, and
only on the evolutionary stage of the active region: large, high-
ﬂux active regions also begin as small, low-ﬂux active regions
with negligible inclination. Relative to our deﬁnition of emer-
gence time (Schunker et al. 2016), on average the active regions
do not show unambiguous intensity darkening in the HMI full-
disk continuum until about one day after emergence, and cir-
cular sunspots with a well-deﬁned penumbra only form about
two days after emergence. So another possible interpretation of
the results in Fisher et al. (1995) would be that many polarities
that are close together have low ﬂux and are near the beginning
of emergence, whereas the polarities that are further apart have
higher ﬂux and are further evolved.

into higher than or equal to, and lower than, the median maximum ﬂux value, 4.6 × 1021 Mx. The standard deviation of the sample
standard deviation at each time interval is described in Schunker et al. (2019, Appendix E). The shaded regions indicate two diﬀerent
phases of emergence, an increasing separation speed between the polarities followed by a decreasing separation speed (Schunker
et al. 2019).

senting the subsurface toroidal ﬂux (e.g. Parker 1955; Cameron
et al. 2018).

In this section we have excluded ten additional active regions
(11122, 11242, 11327, 11396, 11597, 11686, 11736, 11843,
11978, 12011) because they did not have valid position mea-
surements at both TI+00 and TI+09. There are three active re-
gions that maintain a large anti-Joy tilt angle, two in the south-
ern hemisphere AR 11400 (λ = −14◦, sgn(λ)γ = 80◦ at TI+09),
AR 11780 (λ = −8◦, sgn(λ)γ = 72◦ at TI+09) and one in the
northern hemisphere AR 11146 (λ = 23◦, sgn(λ)γ = −68◦ at
TI+09). We keep these active regions in our analysis; excluding
these active regions does not change the results dramatically.

Figure 3 (right) shows the displacement and tilt angle of the
active region polarities two days after emergence. The east-west
separation has increased to 44.7±1.4 Mm, retaining the expected
ﬂux dependence, and the north-south separation now varies with
latitude, suggesting that whatever drives the north-south separa-
tion is responsible for the tilt angle. We ﬁnd no dependence of
the north-south separation on ﬂux.

6. Discussion of the Coriolis effect

The Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the direction of motion
and to the axis of rotation. In the thin ﬂux tube theory it acts on
east-west ﬂows in the ﬂux tube driving a north-south displace-

active regions in the southern hemisphere have been adjusted, i.e. in the southern (northern) hemisphere a negative (positive) δy and
a negative (positive) γ is consistent with Joy’s law (black curve, Wang & Sheeley 1991). The size of the circle is proportional to the
maximum ﬂux of the active region. The thick black points with error bars show latitudinal averages between 0 and 15◦ (sin λ = 0.26)

The north-south separation speed is dependent on latitude at
the time of emergence during Phase 1 (Fig. 4). This demonstrates
that the polarities emerge mostly east-west aligned, imbued with
an inherent north-south velocity that is consistent with Joy’s law.
It is not clear what drives this north-south velocity. Given its de-
pendence on latitude, a natural conclusion is that the Coriolis
force is responsible, but it is not clear upon which east-west ve-
locities it is acting. Naively, the Coriolis force should produce an
acceleration in the north-south direction, but we see from Fig. 4
in Schunker et al. (2019) that the acceleration of the separation
0.1 days after emergence, at the end of Phase 1, is zero within the
uncertainties. This means that if the Coriolis force is acting, then
it is only during a relatively short time to initiate the north-south
velocity, or it is counteracted by an equal and opposite force.
One candidate is the drag force (e.g. Fan 2009).

In Appendix C we model the expected separation of the po-
larities as a function of time and latitude for three models: a con-
stant tilt angle model, the Coriolis eﬀect acting on the east-west
separation speed of the polarities, and a constant initial veloc-

ity model. Our models show that a constant tilt angle model is
not viable (as already shown in Fig. 2, Schunker et al. 2019).
However it is diﬃcult to conclude anything further due to the
large uncertainties in the separation of the polarities.

7. Implications for the tilt angle relaxation

Howard (1996) observed the tendency for the tilt angle to move
towards a more east-west orientation after emergence, which is
not what is expected from the Coriolis force, and described it as
a ‘relaxation’. This was interpreted in terms of magnetic tension
by Longcope & Choudhuri (2002). In this interpretation the tilt
angle evolves towards the position of the tube at the depth where
the tube is disconnected, and they determined that this was likely
to be occurring at the base of the convection zone. The initial
scatter in the positions of the two polarities, imparted by the tur-
bulent convective motions in the upper convection zone, should
dissipate as the magnetic ﬁeld at the surface becomes stronger
and less susceptible to buﬀeting by the convective motions (e.g.
Longcope & Choudhuri 2002; T´oth & Gerlei 2004). In Fig. 5 we
also show that the tilt angles appear to develop a more east-west
orientation, at a rate of −0.33 ± 0.06◦ per day (the change in tilt
angle over two days).

Schunker et al. (e.g. 2019) established that the average east-
west separation of the polarities is larger than the average sepa-
ration in the north-south direction. This east-west motion would
cause a change in the measured tilt angle, rather than a circular
motion of the polarities about a common centre.

To test this idea, we modelled the change in tilt angle, ∆γest,
due to the change in the east-west separation of the polarities
only, by using the measured ∆x = δx(τ = 2.1 days) − δx(τ =
0.1 day) and leaving δy constant at δy(τ = 0.1 day). In Fig. 5 the

the active region. The thick black points with error bars show the averages over diﬀerent ranges of latitude (between 0 and 15◦
(sin λ = 0.26) and 15◦ to 40◦ (sin λ = 0.64) in the northern hemisphere, and the equivalent in the southern hemisphere). The dashed

and we can see that this reproduces much of the apparent relax-
ation.

If we subtract the model tilt angle, ∆γest, the dependency of
the change in tilt angle on the initial tilt angle vanishes. From
our analysis of the independent motion of the polarities we have
demonstrated that what was previously interpreted as a tilt an-
gle relaxation is a straightforward consequence of the east-west
separation of the polarities. Any constraints placed on models of
emerging ﬂux tubes using the apparent tilt angle relaxation need
to be carefully reconsidered.

8. Summary and discussion

Our results show that the forces driving Joy’s law are ob-
served as an inherent north-south separation speed of the po-
larities that depends on latitude but is independent of ﬂux. The
origin of the north-south separation remains unclear. Our results
indicate that if it is due to the Coriolis eﬀect acting on ﬂows
within the emerging ﬂux tube, then the ﬂows in the tube must
be largely directed away from the loop apex and independent of
ﬂux.

Chen et al. (2017) simulate the emergence of a thin ﬂux tube
through the top 20 Mm of the convection zone. The locations of
the polarities at the surface lie above the location of the polarities
at the footpoints (bottom of the box). The simulations do not
include solar rotation per se, but the time evolution of the ﬂux
tube at the bottom boundary does. The simulation of one single
active region cannot be directly compared to an average of many
active regions, and so we are hesitant to compare the tilt angle
development.

Our ﬁnding that, on average, active regions emerge with an east-
west alignment is consistent with earlier observations, but is still
surprising since thin-ﬂux-tube models predict that tilt angles of
rising ﬂux tubes are generated below the surface.

One explanation for the initial observed east-west orientation
is that the initial emerging ﬂux tube has the correct amount of
twist and writhe (e.g. L´opez Fuentes et al. 2003) so that the ﬁeld
at the apex of the emerging loop is east-west aligned. When the

apex breaks the surface, the twisted ﬁeld is aligned east-west,
with Joy’s law developing as the writhe becomes more evident.
It is known that there is a relationship between the supergran-
ulation pattern and where ﬂux emergence occurs (Birch et al.
2019). We speculate that if the supergranulation is guiding the
initial emergence process an alternative explanation for our re-
sults is that the emergence into predominantly east-west aligned
north-south converging ﬂows (Birch et al. 2019) leads to a pref-
erence for east-west alignment of the polarities. Why the emer-
gence location is preferentially in east-west aligned inﬂows is
not clear.

Our ﬁndings are consistent with the model of emerging ﬂux
as presented in Schunker et al. (2019). During Phase 1, active
region polarities emerge east-west aligned (zero tilt angle) with
an increasing separation speed, which lasts until about 0.5 day
after the emergence time, and the tilt angle begins to develop.
Phase 2 begins when the separation speed starts to decrease, un-
til the polarities stop separating about 2.5 − 3 days after the time
of emergence. The latitudinal dependence of the tilt angle, char-
acteristic of Joy’s law sets in during this second phase. In the
ﬁrst day after emergence, the scatter in the tilt angle decreases
independent to the maximum ﬂux, consistent with the polarities
being buﬀeted by near-surface convection as they move to lie
over their footpoints anchored at some depth below the surface.
Analysis of the ﬂows at and below the surface leading up to the
emergence will help to constrain the subsurface picture.

Appendix A: Polarity centres identiﬁed by shifting

the search mask for AR 11072

As described in Section 2 of Schunker et al. (2019), we deﬁne a
search area to be limited to all pixels within a radius of 100 Mm
from the centre of the map, with magnetic ﬁeld strength aver-
aged over all active regions greater than 10 G. This resulted in
a roughly circular search area at the centre of the map for early
time intervals, which increased in size, and became more ellip-
tical with the semi-major axis in the east-west direction in time.
The search mask is the corresponding map where pixels that sat-
isfy this condition have a value of 1, and 0 otherwise.

We then shifted the individual line of sight magnetic ﬁeld
maps so that the location of emergence was at the centre. This
shift used a bilinear interpolation over four pixels. We found that
at later times, when the following polarity is more dispersed, if
we did not shift the maps, but instead shifted the search mask to
lie over the location of the emergence, the displacement of some
of the features relative to the active region centres was signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent.

Figure A.1 shows an example of the location of the follow-
ing and leading polarities for AR 11072. This example shows
the diﬀerences in the location of the leading and following po-
larity computed by either shifting the magnetic ﬁeld maps or the
search mask, which can be signiﬁcant for an individual active
region. Figure A.2 shows the maps for TI+09 where the bilinear
interpolation of the magnetic ﬁeld map can cause a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in the identiﬁed location of the following polarity, and
TI+10 where it does not. The largest diﬀerence is where the bi-
linear interpolation has introduced values a factor of ﬁve larger
(> 900 G, in the white region below the red cross in the TI+09
diﬀerence map). This moves the centre of gravity of a 25 pixel
diameter feature more in this direction. In the case of TI+10, the
interpolator does not introduce such large diﬀerences. However,
in Fig. A.3, which is an updated version of Fig. 2, Schunker et al.
(2019) shows that there are no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the av-
erage polarity positions.

(Snodgrass 1984). We corrected the centre of the map by subtracting the displacement due to diﬀerence between the quiet-Sun
plasma rotation rate xΩ = R(cid:12)Ω(λ) cos(λ)∆τ, where λ is the latitude of the centre of the Postel projected map (see Table A.1 in

circles shows the motion of the polarities belonging to regions with maximum ﬂux higher (lower) than the median ﬂux. The shaded
regions indicate Phase 1, when the separation speed between the polarities increases, and Phase 2 when the separation speed
decreases (see Fig. 4, Schunker et al. 2019).

Appendix B: Polarity centres identiﬁed in

high-resolution maps

For helioseismology purposes it is suﬃcient to have a coarser
resolution (about 1.4 Mm per pixel) than nominally observed by
HMI (about 0.35 Mm per pixel) since the waves are not sensitive
to these scales. However, when measuring the location of the
polarities, it could be the case that a higher resolution is required
for a more precise result.

We repeated our analysis using high-resolution time-
averaged line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld maps at 0.35 Mm per
pixel and shifting the search mask. The high-resolution maps
show more structure in the polarities than the low-resolution
maps, particularly for the more dispersed following polarity (see
Fig. B.1). This makes identifying the primary polarity more dif-
ﬁcult at later times, and so we retain the threshold parameters
used in the low resolution case, in particular we still search for
features with a diameter of 35 Mm. The search area (see black
contour in Fig. B.1) is based on the average of 78 emerging ac-
tive regions (listed below), and so it is similar but not identical
to the search area used in the main analysis of the paper and
Schunker et al. (2019). As an example, we show the position of
the polarities and the tilt angle for both low- and high-resolution
maps of some example active regions in Fig. B.1.

We computed the average position of 78 active regions as
a representative subset in the high-resolution maps (Fig. B.2).
There is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the average position
of the polarities in the high- and low-resolution maps of the same
78 active regions. For our purposes of identifying the location of
the primary leading and following polarities, the lower resolu-
tion maps suﬃce.

The subset of 78 emerging active regions used to compare
the locations of the polarities in the high- and low-resolution
time-averaged line-of-sight magnetogram maps are the follow-

H. Schunker et al.: Emerging active regions: Joy’s law

First we compare the models to the observations as a func-
tion of time in the ﬁrst two days after emergence. We have se-
lected only the EARs which have valid measurements in each
time interval from τ = 0.1 days to τ = 2.1 days (see Table B.1 in
Schunker et al. 2019). Fig. C.1 shows that the constant tilt an-
gle model can be excluded: the displacement in the north-south
direction would not change signiﬁcantly given the change in sep-
aration in the east-west direction. The north-south displacement
due to the constant, initial north-south velocity component of
displacement agrees with the measured displacement best, and
the addition of the Coriolis eﬀect acting on the east west separa-
tion speed is relatively small.

We then compare the models to the observations as a func-
tion of latitude. We measure the change over the ﬁrst two
days after emergence in the separation between the polarities,
∆x = δx(τ = 2.1 days) − δx(τ = 0.1 days) and ∆y = δy(τ =
2.1 days) − δy(τ = 0.1 days), and the change in tilt angle,
∆γ = γ(τ = 2.1 days) − γ(τ = 0.1 days). The time interval is
given in units of days (see Table B.1 in Schunker et al. 2019).
Figure C.2 shows the change in displacement and tilt angle over
two days as a function of latitude. The separation in the east-west
direction is not dependent on latitude, however, the separation
in the north-south direction and the tilt angle is, showing that
the tilt angle comes predominantly from the north-south motion.
Again, we see that the constant tilt angle model cannot explain
the north-south displacement.

Appendix C: Modelling the latitudinal separation

between polarities during emergence

In this section we explore the change in tilt angle in relation to
the Coriolis force, separation speed, and lifetime of the active
regions in the SDO/HEARs database.

We explore three models to describe the north-south dis-

placement:

1. Constant tilt angle: It has been suggested that the ﬂux tube
arrives at the surface already tilted satisfying Joy’s law (e.g.
Weber et al. 2013), but distorted by convection. Here we
test if it is statistically possible that the regions have a con-
stant tilt angle. We model the north-south displacement due
to a constant tilt angle at the time of emergence, as δy(τ) =
− tan (cid:2)γ(τ = 0)(cid:3) δx(τ).

2. Coriolis eﬀect: Joy’s law is a function of latitude, reminis-
cent of the Coriolis force. Howard (1994) showed that bipo-
lar magnetic regions (identiﬁed in white light images) that
move further apart or closer together change tilt angle in
the sense expected from the Coriolis force acting on this
change in separation. This study only considered day-to-day
changes in separation and tilt, and not the evolutionary stage
of the bipolar magnetic regions. Here we model the north-
south displacement of the polarities due to the Coriolis force
given the east-west separation speed and the surface latitu-
dinal diﬀerential rotation. The Coriolis acceleration in the
north-south direction, δ¨yC(τ), acting on a velocity in the east-
west direction, δ dx

local rotation rate, Ω, is
