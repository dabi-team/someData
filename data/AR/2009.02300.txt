ABSTRACT

An algebraic method for the reconstruction and potentially prediction of the solar dipole
moment value at sunspot minimum (known to be a good predictor of the amplitude of
the next solar cycle) was suggested in the ﬁrst paper in this series. The method sums up
the ultimate dipole moment contributions of individual active regions in a solar cycle: for
this, detailed and reliable input data would in principle be needed for thousands of active
regions in a solar cycle. To reduce the need for detailed input data, here we propose a
new active region descriptor called ARDoR (Active Region Degree of Rogueness). In a
detailed statistical analysis of a large number of activity cycles simulated with the 2×2D
dynamo model we demonstrate that ranking active regions by decreasing ARDoR, for a
good reproduction of the solar dipole moment at the end of the cycle it is suﬃcient to
consider the top N regions on this list explicitly, where N is a relatively low number, while
for the other regions the ARDoR value may be set to zero. E.g., with N = 5 the fraction of
cycles where the dipole moment is reproduced with an error exceeding ±30 % is only 12%,
signiﬁcantly reduced with respect to the case N = 0, i.e. ARDoR set to zero for all active
regions, where this fraction is 26%. This indicates that stochastic eﬀects on the intercycle
variations of solar activity are dominated by the eﬀect of a low number of large “rogue”
active regions, rather than the combined eﬀect of numerous small ARs. The method has
a potential for future use in solar cycle prediction.

1. General introduction

The magnetic ﬁelds responsible for solar activity phenomena emerge into the solar atmosphere
in a concentrated form, in active regions (ARs). In each solar cycle thousands of active regions
are listed in the oﬃcial NOAA database and many more small active regions are missed if
their heliographic position and lifetime do not render them directly observable on the visible
hemisphere. Similarly, no detailed catalogues exist for the ubiquitous ephemeral active regions,
of even smaller size.

The emergence of this large number of (typically) bipolar magnetic regions obeys some well
known statistical regularities like Hale’s polarity rules and Joy’s law. As a consequence, upon
their decay by turbulent diﬀusion their remains contribute to the large-scale ordered photo-
spheric magnetic ﬁeld, including the Sun’s global axial dipole ﬁeld (the so-called Babcock–
Leighton mechanism). Active regions emerging in a given solar cycle contribute on average
to the global dipole with a sign opposite to the preexisting ﬁeld at the start of the cycle, and
these contributions from active regions add up until, some time in the middle of the cycle,
the global ﬁeld reverses and a new cycle starts at the Sun’s poles, still overlapping with the
ongoing cycle at low latitudes. Flux emergence is thus an important element of the solar
dynamo mechanism sustaining the periodically overturning solar magnetic ﬁeld.

The inherently stochastic nature of ﬂux emergence introduces random ﬂuctuations into this
statistically ordered process. In recent years it has been realized that the random nature of ﬂux
emergence can give rise to signiﬁcant deviations of the solar dipole moment built up during a
cycle from its expected mean value: in some cycles a small number of so-called “rogue” active
regions (Petrovay and Nagy 2018) with atypical properties may lead to a major, unexpected
change in the level of activity. The unexpected change in the level of activity from solar cycle
23 to 24 has been interpreted as the result a few such abnormal regions by Jiang et al. (2015),
while in a dynamo model Nagy et al. (2017) found that in extreme cases even a single rogue
AR can trigger a grand minimum.

An open question is how to identify the [candidate] rogue active regions, and how many
such regions need to be considered in individual detail in models aiming to reproduce the
evolution of the Sun’s large scale ﬁeld. It is not a priori clear that this number is low, so
the question we pose in this paper is whether the stochastic eﬀects in cycle-to-cycle variation
originating in the random nature of the ﬂux emergence process are dominated by a few
“rogue” AR in each cycle with individually large and unusual contributions to the dipole
moment, or by the “ﬂuctuation background” due to numerous other AR with individually
much lower deviations from the expected dipole contribution. While the recent studies cited
above stressed the importance of a few large rogue AR, the importance of the ﬂuctuation
background cannot be discarded out of hand. The issue has obvious practical signiﬁcance
from the point of view of solar cycle prediction: it would be useful to know how many (and
exactly which) observed individual AR need to be assimilated into a model for successful
forecasts.

A related investigation was recently carried out by Whitbread et al. (2018). In that work
ARs were ordered by their individual contributions to the global axial dipole moment: it was
found that, far from being dominated by a few ARs with the largest contributions, the global
dipole moment built up during a cycle cannot be reproduced without taking into account

a large number (hundreds) of ARs. In another recent work Cameron and Sch¨ussler (2020)
found that even ephemeral active regions contribute to the net toroidal ﬂux loss from the
Sun by an amount comparable to the contribution of large active regions. By analogy, this
opens the possibility that ephemeral ARs may also contribute to the global poloidal ﬁeld by
a non-negligible amount, though statistical studies of the orientation of ephemeral ARs are
unfortunately rare (cf. Tlatov et al. 2010).

While these interesting results shed new light on the overall role of ﬂux emergence in smaller
bipoles in the global dynamo, we think that from the point of view of solar cycle prediction,
instead of the dipole moment contribution per se, a more relevant control parameter is the
deviation of the dipole contribution from the case with no random ﬂuctations in ﬂux emer-
gence, i.e. the “degree of rogueness” (DoR). We therefore set out to systematically study
the eﬀect of individual AR on the subsequent course of solar activity using the DoR as an
ordering parameter.

The question immediately arises how this DoR should be deﬁned.
The approach we take in this work assumes that the eﬀect of random ﬂuctuations manifests
itself primarily in the properties of individual active regions, rather than in their spatiotem-
poral distribution. The DoR based on individual AR properties will be called “active region
degree of rogueness” — ARDoR for brevity.

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces and discusses our deﬁnition
of ARDoR. In Section 3, after recalling salient features of the 2×2D dynamo model, we use
statistics based on this model to answer the central question of this paper. Conclusions are
drawn in Section 4.

2. Introducing ARDoR

The Sun’s axial dipolar moment is expressed as

D(t) =

3
2

(cid:90) π/2

−π/2

B(λ, t) sin λ cos λ dλ,

(1)

where B is the azimuthal average of the large scale photospheric magnetic ﬁeld (assumed to
be radial) while λ is heliographic latitude.

The value Dn of this dipole moment at the start of cycle n is widely considered the
best physics-based precursor of the the amplitude of the incipient cyle n (Petrovay 2020).
Understanding intercycle variations in solar activity and potentially extending the scope of
the prediction calls for an eﬀective and robust method to compute Dn from (often limited)
observational data on the previous course of solar activity.

In the ﬁrst paper of this series, Petrovay et al. (2020) (hereafter Paper 1) we suggested a
simpliﬁed approach to the computation of the evolution of the global axial dipole moment
of the Sun. Instead of solving the partial diﬀerential equation normally used for modeling
surface magnetic ﬂux transport (SFT) processes on the Sun, this method simply represents
the dipole moment by an algebraic sum:

∆Dn ≡ Dn+1 − Dn =

Ntot(cid:88)

i=1

δDU,i =

Ntot(cid:88)

i=1

δD∞,i e(ti−tn+1)/τ =

Ntot(cid:88)

i=1

f∞,i δD1,i e(ti−tn+1)/τ ,

(2)

3

Nagy et al.: Algebraic method of solar cycle prediction II.

where i indexes the active regions in a cycle, Ntot is the total number of ARs in the cycle,
δD1 is the initial contribution of an active region to the global dipole moment, δDU is its
ultimate contribution at the end of a cycle and τ ≤ ∞ is the assumed timescale of magnetic
ﬁeld decay due to radial diﬀusion. Furthermore,

f∞ = δD∞/δD1,

(3)

where δD∞ is the asymptotic contribution of the same AR in a SFT model with τ = ∞, once
the meridional ﬂow has concentrated the relic magnetic ﬂux from the AR to two opposite
polarity patches at the two poles. (See Paper 1 for further explanations.)

In this approach, ARs are assumed to be represented by simple bipoles at the time of their

introduction into the model so their initial dipole moment contribution is given by

δD1 =

3

4πR2 Φ dλ cos λ0,

(4)

where Φ is the magnetic ﬂux in the northern polarity patch, dλ is the latitudinal separation
of the polarities1, λ0 is the initial latitude of [the center of] the bipole and R is the radius of
the Sun. As demonstrated in Paper 1, f∞, is in turn given by

f∞ =

a
λR

exp

(cid:32) −λ2
0
2λ2
R

(cid:33)

.

(5)

It was numerically demonstrated in Paper 1 that this Gaussian form holds quite generally
irrespective of the details of the SFT model, its parameters (λR and a) only have a very
weak dependence on the assumed form of the meridional ﬂow proﬁle (at least for proﬁles
that are closer to observations), and their value only depends on a single combination of SFT
model parameters. The values of λR and a for a given SFT model may be determined by
interpolation of the numerical results, as presented in Paper 1.

The terms of the sum (2) represent the ultimate dipole contributions δDU of individual
active regions in a cycle at the solar minimum ending that cycle. In principle each and every
active region should be represented by an explicit term in the sum. Such a case was indeed
considered in Paper 1 in a comparison with a run result from the 2×2D dynamo and it was
found that the algebraic method returns the total change in dipole moment during a cycle
quite accurately in the overwhelming majority of cycles.

When it comes to applying the method to the real Sun, however, the need to include each
bipolar region in the source becomes quite a nuisance. As discussed above in the Introduction,
data for individual active regions are often missing for the smaller ARs, while in the case of
the larger, more complex AR representing them by an instantaneously introduced bipole is
nontrivial. As it was recently pointed out by Iijima et al. (2019), for an AR with zero tilt but
diﬀerent extents of the two polarity distributions δD∞ will be nonzero, even though δD1 = 0
for this conﬁguration. The reason is that the conﬁguration has a nonzero quadrupole moment,
which may alternatively be represented by not one but two oppositely oriented dipoles slightly
shifted in latitude.
1 dλ = d sin α where d is the full angular polarity separation on the solar surface and α is the tilt
angle of the bipole axis relative to the east–west direction, the sign of α being negative for bipoles
disobeying Hale’s polarity rules.

Such intricacies would certainly make it advisable to keep the number of active regions
explicitly represented in the sum (2) to a minimum. This again brings us to the central
question of this paper: how many and which active regions need to be explicitly taken into
consideration for the calculation of the solar dipole moment? While the previous study of
Whitbread et al. (2018) has shown that keeping only a few ARs in the summation is certainly
not correct, representing the rest of the ARs in a less faithful or detailed manner may still be
admissible as long as this does not distort the statistics.

To select those few ARs that still need to be realistically represented we introduce the
concept of ARDoR. As known examples of rogue AR presented e.g. in Nagy et al. (2017)
are primarily rogue on account of their unusual tilts and large separations, the ﬁrst idea is
to deﬁne ARDoR as the diﬀerence between the ultimate dipole moment contribution of an
AR and the value this would take with no scatter in the tilt and separation (i.e. if the tilt
and separation were to take their expected values for the given latitude and magnetic ﬂux,
as given by eqs. (15) and (16a) in Lemerle et al. 2015).

In the present paper we thus consider the case where for the majority of ARs only the
information regarding their size (magnetic ﬂux) and heliographic latitude is retained, while
further details such as polarity separation or tilt angle (and therefore δD1) are simply set
to their expected values for the ARs with the given ﬂux and heliographic latitude (“reduced
stochasticity” or RS representation), and compare this with the case when the actual polarity
separations and tilts are used (“fully stochastic” or FS case). The active region degree of
rogueness is deﬁned by

ARDoR = δDU,FS − δDU,RS = f∞ e(ti−tn+1)/τ (δD1,FS − δD1,RS).

(6)

An objection to this deﬁnition may be raised as a large AR with unusually low separation
and/or tilt will yield a negligible contribution to the dipole moment (δDU = 0), yet it may
be characterized by a large negative DoR value according to the proposed deﬁnition. On the
other hand, this is arguably not a shortcoming of the approach: on the contrary, as the total
ﬂux emerging in a cycle of a given amplitude is more or less ﬁxed, the emergence of a large
AR with unusually low δDU implies that the expected δDU contribution will be “missing”
at the ﬁnal account, resulting in the buildup of lower-than-expected global dipole moment at
the end of the cycle.

Ranking the ARs in a cycle according to their decreasing ARDoR values, we now set out
to compare the results where ARDoR is explicitly considered for the top N ARs on this list,
while the rest of the ARs are represented in the RS approach. We ask the question what is
the lowest value for N for which the algebraic method still yields acceptable results?

3. ARDoR and rogue active regions in the 2×2D dynamo model

Characteristics of the hybrid kinematic 2 × 2D Babcock-Leighton dynamo model developed
by Lemerle et al. (2015) and Lemerle and Charbonneau (2017) are particularly suitable for a
study of this type. This model couples an internal axially symmetric ﬂux transport dynamo
(FTD) with a surface ﬂux transport (SFT) model. The FTD component module provides
the new active region emergences acting as a source term in the SFT component, while
the output of the SFT model is used as upper boundary condition on the FTD model. In

the model, bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) representing active regions are generated at
the surface randomly, with a probability based on the amplitude of the toroidal ﬁeld in the
deep convective zone, their properties being drawn from a statistical ensemble constructed
to obey observationally determined statistical relationships. This makes it straightforward to
extract the set of AR properties for any cycle from the model and to convert it to a reduced
stochasticity set by setting the random ﬂuctuations around the mean in the distributions

divided by the total ARDoR of all ARs for cycles where the total ARDoR exceeds 15 % of
the absolute change in the dipole moment ∆D (230 cycles)

of polarity separations and tilts to zero. In addition, the numerical eﬃciency of the model
allows to run it for a large number of simulated solar cycles, rendering it suitable for statistical
analysis of the results.

For the present analysis we use run results from the standard setup of the 2×2D model as
described in Lemerle and Charbonneau (2017). Evaluating the parameters of the algebraic
model from the numerical results presented in Paper 1 (for the same meridional ﬂow and
parameter values as in the dynamo model) yields λR = 13.◦6 and a/λR = 3.75, so for the
algebraic method these values are used. The number of simulated cycles used in the analysis
was 647. The distribution of computed ARDoR values is plotted in Fig. 1.

ARs in each cycle are ranked by the ARDoR values. In each cyle we compute the absolute
change ∆D in the global solar dipole moment from equation (2) for a “cocktail” of ARs,
taking the ARs with the top N highest ARDoR from the original, fully stochastic set, while
taking the rest from the RS set. For brevity, this will be referred to as the “rank-N ARDoR
method”. The dipole moment change calculated with the rank-N ARDoR method is then

where the AR index i is in the order of decreasing ARDoR.

Note that the special case N = 0, i.e. the RS set was already considered in Paper 1 where we
found that even this method yields ∆D values in good agreement with the full simulations for
a large majority of the cycles, but the prediction breaks down for a signiﬁcant minority. As we
are primarily interested in improving predictions for this minority, we ﬁrst select cycles where
the diﬀerence between the ∆D values from the fully stochastic and reduced stochasticity sets
exceeds ±15 %. (Note that this diﬀerence is by deﬁnition equal to the sum of ARDoRs for all
ARs in the cycle, so the condition for selection was ((cid:80)Ntot
i=1 ARDoRi)/∆D > 0.15, which held
for 230 cycles.)

collected in Table 1. It is apparent that ARs with the top 10–20 highest ARDoR are suﬃcient
to explain 80–90 % of the deviation of ∆D computed with the reduced stochasticity model
from the full value of ∆D. Even the single AR with the highest ARDoR alone can explain
50 % of the deviation. Meanwhile, a signiﬁcant scatter is present in the plots: e.g., adding up
the columns below 0.5 and above 1.5 in the 4th panel one ﬁnds that in ∼ 8 % of these 230
deviating cycles even the rank-20 ARDoR method is insuﬃcient to reproduce the deviation
at an accuracy better than ±50 %. (This is ±50% of the deviation: as in this sample the mean
deviation is roughly ∼ 20% of the expected value of ∆D, ∆D itself is still reproduced with
an accuracy up to ±10% for these cycles.)

The improvement that the ARDoR method brings to the problem of reproducing the solar
axial dipole moment at the end of a cycle is dramatically illustrated in Fig. 3. While in the
case of ranking ARs by δD even adding contributions from the top 750 AR yields only a
barely tolerable representation of the dipole moment variation, the ARDoR method produces
excellent agreement already for very low values of the rank N . The quality of these repre-
sentations is documented in Table 2. The standard deviation of the rank-5 ARDoR method
relative to the simulation result is lower than in the case of ∆D calculated from even the top
750 highest δD contributions.

Finally, in Fig. 4 we present histograms of the deviations from the simulated value of ∆D
computed with the various methods (FS, RS and ARDoR with diﬀerent N values). Here
deviations are expressed as fractions of the actual ∆D resulting from the simulations, i.e. the
quantities given in the headings of Table 2 are divided by ∆D. Adding up the columns it is
straightforward to work out from this that, e.g., in the case of the rank-5 ARDoR method

less than 15 % in 88 % of the cycles. As ∆D is, on average, twice the amplitude of the polar
ﬁeld at minimum, the rank-5 ARDoR method reproduces the polar ﬁeld precursor within
±30 % in 88 % of all cycles. This is to be compared to 74 % of the cycles in the RS case.

4. Conclusions

In Paper 1 we introduced a method to reconstruct variations in the global axial dipole moment
of the Sun by an algebraic summation of the contributions from individual active regions. In
principle, for the application of this method, for each AR the optimal representation in terms
of a simple bipole (or possibly several bipoles in more complex cases) needs to be known.
Obtaining this information for thousands of active regions is a nontrivial task, but signiﬁcant
eﬀorts have been made in this direction:
– Wang and Sheeley (1989) determined the properties of bipoles representing close to 3000
ARs with Φ > 3 · 1020 Mx from NSO-KP (Kitt Peak) magnetograms in Cycle 21 (1976–
1986). Each AR was considered at its maximum development; recurrent ARs were multiply
listed.

– Yeates et al. (2007) determined the properties of bipoles representing ARs from NSO-
KP/SOLIS synoptic magnetic maps in cycles 23 and 24 (1997–2017). Each AR was con-
sidered at central meridian passage; recurrent ARs were multiply listed.

– Whitbread et al. (2018) determined initial dipole moments D1 for active regions from Kitt
Peak/SOLIS synoptic magnetic maps in cycles 21–24 (1976–2017). Each AR was considered
at central meridian passage; recurrent ARs were multiply listed.

– From white-light data without direct magnetic information Jiang et al. (2019) determined
an indicative “dipole moment index” for sunspot groups larger than 800 MSH in cycles
21–24 (1976–2017).
Data resulting from the above listed eﬀorts have been placed in public databases.2 In
addition to these, Li and Ulrich (2012) determined tilt angles for 30,600 ARs from Mt.Wilson
ad MDI magnetograms in cycles 21–24 (1974–2010). Virtanen et al. (2019b) determined
initial dipole moments D1 for active regions from Kitt Peak/SOLIS synoptic magnetic maps
combined with SDO HMI synoptic maps in cycles 21–24 (1976–2019).

The above studies are limited to the last four cycles when magnetograms were available on a
regular basis. For earlier cycles, a number of statistical analyses of sunspot data without direct
magnetic information (e.g., Dasi-Espuig et al. 2010, Ivanov 2012, McClintock and Norton
2013, Baranyi 2015, I¸sık et al. 2018, Senthamizh Pavai et al. 2015) resulted in tilt angle values,
oﬀering some potential for use as input for models of the dipole moment evolution. Recently,
information on the magnetic polarities of sunspots from Mt.Wilson measurements has been
used in combination with Ca II spectroheliograms by Pevtsov et al. (2016) to construct
“pseudo-magnetograms” for the period 1915–1985; the results have been benchmarked against
direct observations for the last period (Virtanen et al. 2019a).

Despite these impressive eﬀorts, the determination of AR dipole moment values to be
used as input in our algebraic method is subject to many uncertainties. As discussed in the
Introduction, the available data are increasingly incomplete for smaller ARs. The arbitrariness
of the time chosen for the incorporation of ARs is also problematic as during their evolution
the structure of ARs can change signiﬁcantly due to processes not represented in the SFT
models (ﬂux emergence or localized photospheric ﬂows). The complexities of AR structure

imply that their representation with a single bipole may be subject to doubt (cf. Jiang et al.
2019, Iijima et al. 2019). And for historical data these diﬃculties are further aggravated.

In view of these considerable diﬃculties, looking for ways to minimize the need for detailed
input data for our algebraic method is advisable. With this objective in mind, in the present
work we introduced the ARDoR method and tested it on a large number of activity cycles
simulated with the 2×2D dynamo model. We found that
– Including all information on the bipolar active regions appearing in a cycle, our algebraic
method can reproduce the dipole moment at the end of the cycle with an error below ±30 %
in over 97 % of cycles.

– Using only positions and magnetic ﬂuxes of the ARs, and arbitrarily equating their polar-
ity separations and tilts to their expected values (reduced stochasticity or RS case), the
algebraic method can reproduce the dipole moment at the end of the cycle with an error
below ±30 % in about 74 % of cycles.

– Combining the RS case with detailed information on a small number N of ARs with the
largest ARDoR values, the fraction of unexplained cycles is signiﬁcantly reduced (from
26 % to 12 % in the case of N = 5 and a ±30 % accuracy threshold).
These results indicate that stochastic eﬀects on the intercycle variations of solar activity
are dominated by the eﬀect of a low number of large “rogue” active regions, rather than the
combined eﬀect of numerous small ARs.

Beyond the academic interest of these results, the method has a potential for use in solar
cycle prediction. For the realization of this potential, however, a number of further problems
need to be addressed. As in forecasts the positions and ﬂuxes of ARs are also not known,
the representation of the majority of ARs not faithfully represented in our method must be
stochastic also in these variables, or simply replaced by a smooth continuous distribution.
Furthermore, for the selection of ARs with the top N ARDoR values these values should be
theoretically be computed for all ARs. To avoid this need, “proxies” of ARDoR based on
straightforward numerical criteria may need to be identiﬁed to select the ARs for which a
more in-depth study is then needed to determine ARDoR values. Studies in this direction are
left for further research.
