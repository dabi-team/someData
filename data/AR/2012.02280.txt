ABSTRACT
We report a study of the X-ray emission from the white dwarf/M-type star binary system AR Scorpii
using archival data taken in 2016-2020. It has been known that the X-ray emission is dominated by the
optically thin thermal plasma emission, and its ﬂux level varies signiﬁcantly over the orbital phase.
The X-ray emission also contains a component that modulates with the beat frequency between
the white dwarf’s spin frequency and orbital frequency. In this new analysis, the 2020 data taken
by NICER shows that the X-ray emission is modulating with the spin frequency as well as the beat
frequency, indicating that part of the X-ray emission is coming from the white dwarf’s magnetosphere.
It is found that the signal of the spin frequency appears only at a speciﬁc orbital phase, while the
beat signal appears over the orbital phase. We interpret the X-ray emission modulating with the
spin frequency and the beat frequency as a result of the synchrotron emission from electrons with a
smaller and larger pitch angle, respectively. In a long-term evolution, the beat pulse proﬁle averaged
over the orbital phase changed from a single-peak structure in 2016/2018 to a double-peak structure
in 2020. The observed X-ray ﬂux levels measured in 2016/2017 are higher than those measured in
2018/2020. The plasma temperature and amplitude of the orbital waveform might vary with time
too. These results indicate that the X-ray emission from AR Scorpii evolves on a timescale of years.
This long-term evolution would be explained by a super-orbital modulation related to, for example, a
precession of the white dwarf, or a ﬂuctuation of the system related to activity of the companion star.

1. INTRODUCTION
AR Scorpii is a binary system composed of a white
dwarf (hereafter WD) and a M-type main-sequence star,
and its distance from the Earth is estimated to be
d ∼ 116pc (Marsh et al. 2016; Bailer-Jones et al. 2018;
Peterson et al. 2019). The emission from radio to X-
ray bands is modulating with the orbital period of
Po ∼ 3.56 hours (Marsh et al. 2016; Stanway et al. 2018;
Takata et al. 2018). Marsh et al. (2016) report that in
addition to the orbital modulation, the radio/optical
emission from AR Scorpii is modulating in a beat fre-
quency, νb = νs − νo ∼ 8.46 mHz, where νs ∼ 8.54 mHz
is the spin frequency of the WD and νo ∼ 0.078 mHz
is the orbital frequency. AR Scorpii is the ﬁrst WD
that shows a modulation of the radio emission related
to the WD’s spin. The pulsed emission up to soft X-
ray bands has been conﬁrmed (Takata et al. 2018), and
no conﬁrmation of the GeV emission has been reported
(Kaplan et al. 2019; Singh et al. 2020). A spin down of
the WD has been measured by the optical observations
(Marsh et al. 2016; Potter & Buckley 2018a; Stiller et al.
2018; Gaibor et al. 2020). With a longer base line of the
optical observations, Gaibor et al. (2020) measure a spin
down rate as ˙νs ∼ (−4.82 ± 0.18) × 10−17 Hz s−1, indi-
cating the spin down power of Lsd ∼ 2 × 1033 erg s−1.

Marsh et al. (2016) report that the optical emission is
minimum around the inferior conjunction of the com-
panion star’s orbit, where the companion star is be-
tween the WD and Earth, while it achieves the maximum
level slightly earlier than the superior conjunction, where
the companion star is behind the WD. Littleﬁeld et al.
(2017) ﬁnd that the orbital modulation has been fairly
stable with 78 days of observations, but suggest with
a longer base line optical data that the orbital maxi-
mum shifts toward earlier phases relative to the superior
conjunction with time. Katz (2017) interprets this ob-
served orbital waveform and the long-term evolution with
a precession model of the WD’s spin axis. Peterson et al.
(2019), on the other hand, report that the orbital wave-
form of AR Scorpii has remained constant across about
one century, and constrain the ﬁrst time derivative of the
orbital frequency as ˙νo ≤ 3.8 × 10−20 Hz s−1.

Marcote et al. (2017) carry out a radio observation
with a high angular resolution and ﬁnd that the radio
emission region of AR Scorpii is compact with a scale
of ≤ 4R⊙. They also report no evidence for a radio
outﬂow or collimated jets. Then, Stanway et al. (2018)
conﬁrm that the orbital modulation in radio bands shows
a similar trend to that of the optical emission. This indi-
cates that inner-surface of the companion star is probably
heated by an interaction with the WD magnetosphere or
by an irradiation of synchrotron radiation from the WD’s
magnetosphere (Garnavich et al. 2019), and the emission
from radio to optical bands is mainly produced at the re-
gion near or on the inner-surface.

The pulse proﬁle folded with the beat frequency shows
a double-peak structure in the radio, optical and UV
bands.
In optical/UV bands, the pulse shape can be
described by a main peak plus a small secondary peak,
for which the phase separation is ∼ 0.5 (Marsh et al.
2016). The pulsed fraction reaches > 95% in the UV

band. Marsh et al. (2016) also ﬁnd a signal of the spin
frequency of the WD in the periodograms, suggesting
that the optical pulsed emission originates from a region
co-rotating with the WD. The optical emission from AR
Scorpii is also unique with a strong linear polarization.
Buckley et al. (2017) show that the degree of the linear
polarization reaches up to ∼ 40% at the pulse peak, and
the position angle swings through 180◦. These proper-
ties of the linear polarization indicate an origin of syn-
chrotron emission from the relativistic electrons spiraling
along the magnetic ﬁeld of the WD (Potter & Buckley
2018b; Takata & Cheng 2019; du Plessis et al. 2019).

In radio bands, Marsh et al. (2016) show the pulse pro-
ﬁle can be described by a double-peak structure with a
pulsed fraction of ∼ 10%, which is smaller than those
in the optical/UV bands. Stanway et al. (2018) report
that the beat signal decreases with the radio frequency,
and no beat signal is found at 1.5GHz. The radio emis-
sion does not show an evident signal of the WD spin in
the periodograms, which indicates that the pulsed radio
emission originates from the region in the magnetosphere
of the companion star rather than in the magnetosphere
of the WD. Stanway et al. (2018) also measure a weak
linear polarization with a degree < 1% but a large circu-
lar polarization, which reaches to ∼ 30% at the orbital
phase φo ∼ 0.8, where φo = 0 is deﬁned at the inferior
conjunction of the companion star’s orbit. They suggest
that a non-relativistic cyclotron emission dominates the
radio emission at lower frequencies.

The broadband spectrum from the radio to UV bands
can be described by a thermal optical emission from the
companion star plus non-thermal component with a total
luminosity of L ∼ 2 × 1032 erg s−1, which is about 10%
of the spin down power. Garnavich et al. (2019) mea-
sure the slope of the optical spectrum and ﬁnd that the
power-law index s, Fν ∝ ν−s, shows a signiﬁcant vari-
ation in 0.8 < s < 2.0 depending on the orbital phase
and the optical brightness. They suggest that the varia-
tion in the power-law index is related to the synchrotron
cooling and frequency of the replenishment of the energy
injection. This non-thermal component has an energy
peak at around 0.01eV and probably extends down to
radio bands with a slope of Fν ∼ ν1/3 (Stanway et al.
2018), which is consistent with the slope of low energy
tail of the synchrotron emission (Geng et al. 2016). In
the radio bands, the spectrum becomes shallower below
∼ 1GHz (Marsh et al. 2016; Stanway et al. 2018). This
also indicates that an additional component (probably
cyclotron emission from non-relativistic electrons) dom-
inates at low radio frequency bands.

In the higher energy band, we (Takata et al. 2018)
study the X-ray emission from AR Scorpii with an XMM-
Newton observation carried out in 2016. The observed
spectrum shows an iron-K line that is well described by
an optically thin thermal plasma emission with several
diﬀerent temperatures; there is no signature of the emis-
sion from an accreting matter in the observed spectrum.
The observed X-ray ﬂux varies signiﬁcantly over the or-
bital phase (Figure 1), and it achieves maximum and
minimum at around the superior conjunction and infe-
rior conjunction of the companion star, respectively. The
hardness ratio of the observed X-ray emission, on the
other hand, is almost constant over the orbital phase.

These emission properties are compatible to the thermal
process of the plasmas heated to 0.1 − 10 keV on or near
the inner surface of the companion star, and the orbital
variation of the observed ﬂux is caused by a variation of
the visible emission region over the orbital phase rather
than an absorption by the accretion column. The X-ray
luminosity is of the order of LX ∼ 4×1030 erg s−1, and it
is ∼ 1% of the optical/UV luminosity of the non-thermal
component. Hence, a small fraction of the released en-
ergy is used for heating up the plasma to a temperature
of ∼keV, and majority is for creating a population of the
non-thermal electrons.

Takata et al. (2018) ﬁnd a modulation with the beat
frequency in the X-ray data below 2 keV. The pulse
proﬁle averaged over the orbital phase shows a single-
peak (or probably double-peak with a small secondary
peak). On the other hand, the orbital resolved analysis
shows that the pulse structure evolves over the orbital
phase, and the pulse proﬁle at around the inferior con-
junction of the companion star can be described by a
double-peak structure with a prominent secondary peak.
The averaged pulsed fraction is about 14%, suggesting
that the unpulsed component is the main component in
the X-ray bands. By comparing the pulse proﬁle mea-
sured by the EPIC camera with the proﬁle by the OM
camera onboard XMM-Newton, we ﬁnd that the X-ray
peak and optical/UV peak are in phase. This suggests
that the non-thermal component in optical/UV bands
extends to the soft X-ray bands. The phase-resolved
spectrum of the pulsed component in the 0.15-2 keV
band shows evidence of the power-law component with
a photon index Γ = 2.3 ± 0.5 and an unabsorbed ﬂux
F0.15−2 ∼ 4 × 10−13erg cm−2 s−1.

After the discovery of the radio/optical pulsed emis-
sion from AR Scorpii in 2016, more X-ray data have been
collected. It enables us to study a long-term evolution
of the X-ray emission from AR Scorpii. In this paper,
we study the X-ray emission properties of AR Scorpii
using archival data taken by XMM-Newton, Chandra,
NuSTAR and NICER during 2016-2020 (Table 1).
In
section 2, we summarize the data reduction for each ob-
servation. We present the results of the timing analysis
in section 3 and of spectral analysis in section 4. In sec-
tion 5, we discuss the X-ray emission process in the WD
magnetosphere based on the results of the study.

the
taken at 2016 September 10
(MOS1/2 and PN)
(Obs. ID:0783940101, PI: Steeghs) and at 2018 Febru-
ary 19.
ID: 0795720101, PI: Pavlov) with total
exposure times of 39 ks and 30 ks, respectively (Table 1).
The observations were operated under the small window
mode for the MOS1/MOS2 and the large window mode
for the PN in 2016 (hereafter X16), while with full
frame mode for all EPIC cameras in 2018 (hereafter
X18). Event list for each detector and observation is
produced in the standard way using XMM-Newton
Science Analysis Software (XMMSAS, version 18.0.0). A
point source is signiﬁcantly detected by the XMMSAS
task detect_chain. We generate the source spectra
within a radius of 20′′ circle centered at source position
(R.A., Dec.)=(16h21m47s.28,−22◦53′10′′.4) and the
background spectra from a source free region. When
we generate the spectra, we remove epoch with back-
ground ﬂaring by limiting the count rate above 10 keV
to < 0.35 count s−1 for the MOS1/MOs2 data and
< 0.4 count s−1 for the PN data. We create response
ﬁles with the XMMSAS tasks rmfgen and arfgen with
updated calibration ﬁles. We group the spectral bins
to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of S/N ≥ 3 in each
bin using the XMMSAS task specgrp. We use the XMMSAS
task barycen to obtain barycenter corrected arrival
times (ephemeris DE405) and create the background
subtracted light curve with the task epiclccorr to
examine the orbital variation. We generate the orbital
light curves in the 0.3-10keV band, and compare it with
the results of the Chandra and NICER data (Figure 1).
The X18 data recorded a large ﬂare-like background
event covering a signiﬁcant part of the observation. Af-
ter removing such a background event, the exposure of
the data used in the spectral analysis is about 10 ks for
the PN data and 20 ks for the MOS1/MOS2 data, re-
spectively. Figure 2 shows the orbital phase distribution
of the exposure time for the data used in the spectral
analysis; the maximum exposure time is normalized to
unity. We can see that a large exposure loss because of
the background events causes a non-uniform orbital cov-
erage of the X18 data. For the X16 data, the exposure
loss due to the ﬂare-like background events is less serious
compared to the case of the X18 data.

2.2. Chandra

A Chandra observation for AR Scorpii (Obs.

ID:
19711, PI:Pavlov) was operated under ACIS Timed Ex-
posure (1/8 sub-array) mode and an exposure time of
24.8 ks (hereafter Ch17). We re-process the data with
standard tasks in the CIAO Version 4.11. We use the
CIAO task specextract to generate the source spectrum
and associated response ﬁles from a circular region cen-
tered at aforementioned position with a radius 3.6′′, and
create a background spectrum from a vicinity source free
region.
It is known that pile-up of a Chandra data is
signiﬁcant when the count rate is ≥ 0.1 count s−1 (Davis
2001). In section 4.1.3, we examine the pile-up fraction
as ∼ 5% for this observation. For a timing analysis, we
apply the CIAO task axbary to obtain barycen-corrected
arrival time of each event, and use dmextract task to
create a background subtracted light curve in the 0.3-
10keV band to examine the orbital variation. We check
the background light curve and ﬁnd no indication of ﬂar-

ing. For searching a beat frequency in the data, we use
the Xselect to extract events from the source region and
obtain a photon count of ∼4200.

2.3. NuSTAR
To examine the hard X-ray emission from AR Scor-
pii, we analyze the archival NuSTAR data taken at
2018 February (Obs. ID: 30301027002, PI: Pavlov) with
an exposure ∼134 ks (hereafter Nu18). Event list and
source/background spectra are produced in the stan-
dard way using nupipline and nuproducts tasks of
the Heasoft. Barycenter correction is applied in the
nuproducts task. A point source is clearly seen in the
generated image. We create the source spectrum with
the data extracted from a circular region with a radius
of 50′′ centered at aforementioned source position, and
we obtain a background spectrum from a vicinity source
free region. We use grppha task of the FTOOLS to group
the spectral bins such that new grouping contains a min-
imum of 30 counts in each bin. We create a background
subtracted light curve in the 3-78 keV band. We extract
∼ 10, 000 events from the source region, and search for
the beat frequency in the data.

2.4. NICER
NICER observed AR Scorpii at 2020 June 14-16
(Obs. IDs: 589010101-358901015 PI: Mori) with a to-
tal exposure ∼ 57 ks (hereafter Ni20). We merge the
mpu7_ufa ﬁles for the ﬁve observations using the task
nimpumerge of the Heasoft, and screen the data us-
ing the tasks nicerclean and nimaketime. We ﬁlter
the raw data with the standard criteria for analysis of
the beat/spin modulation, and we apply an additional
ﬁltering based on the magnetic cut-oﬀ rigidity to gen-
erate spectrum and orbital light curve. We accept the
time with > 1.5GeV/c in current analysis and ﬁnd that
a more tight ﬁltering does not aﬀect much to the re-
sult of the analyses. We use the latest calibration ﬁles
(xti20200722) and recalibrate the energy scale using
the ﬁle nixtiflightpi20170601v004.fits. We apply a
barycentric time correction to the created event list using
barycor task of the Heasoft. After standard screening,
we also remove ﬂare-like background events using the
Xselect.

We generate the spectra of the source region and
background modeling with nibackgeng3C50 task imple-
mented in the HEASoft; we create a ﬁlter ﬁle with an op-
tion coltypes="base,3c50" in the task niprefilter26.
We use the grppha task to group the generated spec-
trum such that new grouping contains a minimum of 40
counts in each bin. We note that the best-ﬁt parameters
for the spectrum obtained with the original event ﬁle is
consistent with those obtained with the nibackgeng3C50
product within the errors. In this study, therefore, we
will present the ﬁtting result with the nibackgeng3C50
product.

Figure 2 shows that the 2020 NICER observation does
not cover uniformly the orbital phase. We generate an
exposure corrected light curve in the 0.3-10 keV band
using the Xselect. Using the source and background
spectra obtained by the nibackgeng3C50 task, we esti-
mate that the background emission contributes to ∼ 55%

background events. For Ni20 data, a non-continuous monitoring
of the source produces a large ﬂuctuation of the exposure fraction
over the orbital phase.

of total emission in the 0.3-10 keV band. By removing
55% of the total counts from the generated light curve,
we create a background subtracted light curve, which is
compared with other observations (Figure 1).

and T0(MJD) = 57264.09615 when the companion star
is located at the inferior conjunction. Figure 1 shows
the orbital light curves in the 0.3-10 keV band for the
X16/18, Ch17 and Ni20 data and in the 3-78 keV band
for the Nu18 data; the background level is subtracted for
each light curve. We can see that all light curves show
a signiﬁcant orbital modulation, and the observed ﬂux
levels achieve the maximum and minimum at around the
superior conjunction (φo = 0.5) and inferior conjunction
(φo = 0), respectively. As discussed in Takata et al.
(2018), this pattern of the orbital modulation indicates
that X-ray emission from AR Scorpii mainly originates
from the region located near or on the inner surface of
the companion star.

To examine a long-term evolution of the orbital wave-
form, we ﬁt the obtained light curve with one Gaus-
sian component plus a constant component (Figure 1).
We deﬁne amplitude of the orbital variation as (fmax −
fmin)/(fmax + fmin), where fmax and fmin are the max-
imum and minimum counts obtained from the best-ﬁt
function, respectively (˙Inam et al. 2004; Rea et al. 2007).
We obtain amplitudes of ∼ 0.22 ± 0.01 for the X16 data,
∼ 0.16 ± 0.03 for the C1h7 data, ∼ 0.21 ± 0.01 for the
X18 data and ∼ 0.18 ± 0.02 for the Nu18 data. For the
Ni20 data, we obtain an amplitude of ∼ 0.32 ± 0.01 by
assuming 55% of the background level, and we ﬁnd that
the amplitude is larger than those of other data. This
would provide evidence of the long-term evolution of the
orbital waveform in the X-ray bands, although additional
observations with an imaging capability is necessary to
conﬁrm it. By comparing the amplitude of X18 data
with that of Nu18 data, we ﬁnd less dependency of the
orbital waveform on the photon energy. This constant
amplitude among diﬀerent energy bands also indicates
that the orbital modulation is caused by a variation of
the visible emission region over the orbital phase.

Fig. 5.— Pulse proﬁles in the 0.3-2 keV band folded with the
beat frequency for the three data sets. Each event is folded with
the timing solution described in section 3.3, and the background
contribution is subtracted for each light curve. The 55% of the
background level in the total emission is assumed for Ni20 data.
“ON” and “OFF” in each panel indicate the on-pulse phase and
oﬀ-pulse phase to generate the spectrum of the pulsed component,
respectively (section 4.3).

We

frequency νb ∼ 8.6mHz
search the beat
(Marsh et al. 2016) using the Z 2
2 -test (Buccheri et al.
1983). For the X16 and X18 data sets, the extracted
photon events from the source region yield ∼ 45, 000 and
∼ 20, 000 counts, respectively. We use ∼ 4, 200 counts
for Ch17, ∼ 10, 000 counts for Nu18 FPMA/FPMB and
∼ 135, 000 photons for Ni20 to search the beat frequency.
In addition to the X16 data reported by Takata et al.
(2018), a signiﬁcant pulsed signal is found in X18 and
Ni20 data sets. Since the pulsed fraction is ∼ 14%
(Takata et al. 2018), the counts of the pulsed emission

5

in the Ch17 data will be only ∼ 600 or less, and it is
unlikely to ﬁnd a beat signal in the data. Although we
combine all observations, which include the Nu20 data,
to search a pulsation in the > 2 keV band, we do not ﬁnd
any signiﬁcant signal at the beat frequency. This non-
detection of the beat frequency with the number of the
collected photon counts is expected, because only ∼ 2%
of the total emission from AR Scorpii is pulsating in the
> 2 keV band (section 4.3).

Figures 3 and 4 present the Z 2

2 -periodograms for the
X18 and Ni20 data, respectively [see Takata et al. (2018)
for the Z 2
2 periodogram of the X16 data]. We can see a
strong signal at the beat frequency νb ∼ 8.46mHz and
the 1st harmonic in the Ni20 data. In addition to the
beat frequency, we can also conﬁrm a signiﬁcant signal
at the spin frequency of the WD, νs ∼ 8.53mHz and the
1st/2nd harmonics. The signal of the spin frequency with
Z 2
2 ∼ 50
of the X16 data (Takata et al. 2018) and Z 2
2 ∼ 20 of the
X18 data. The Ni20 data therefore provides a concrete
evidence that the pulsed X-ray emission originates from
the WD magnetosphere and its emission region is co-
rotating with the WD.

2 ∼ 125 of the Ni20 data is much stronger than Z 2

3.3. Long-term evolution of pulse proﬁle
To compare between the pulse proﬁles measured by
XMM-Newton and NICER observations, we restrict
the photon energy in the 0.3-2 keV band, and create
folded light curves with the beat ephemeris provided
˙νb =
by Gaibor et al. (2020): νb = 8.460297018mHz,
−4.82 × 10−17Hz s−1 and T0(MJD) = 57941.16888790.
For X16/18 data, we determine the background level
from a nearby source free region. For Ni50 data, we gen-
erate the background subtracted light curve by assuming
that the background level is 55% of the total emission.

Figure 5 shows the pulse proﬁles for the three data
sets, and we ﬁnd that the pulse proﬁle of the Ni20 data
is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of the X16/18 data.
The pulse proﬁles of the X16/X18 data show a single-
peak structure. For the N20 data, on the other hand,
the pulse proﬁle shows a double-peak structure with a
phase separation of δφb ∼ 0.4 − 0.5. The diﬀerence in
the pulse proﬁles between the X16/X18 and Ni20 data
may indicate a temporal evolution of the pulsed X-ray
emission. Takata et al. (2018), on the other hand, ﬁnd
that the pulse proﬁle evolves over the orbital phase, and
it can be represented by either a single peak structure
or a double-peak structure. The pulse proﬁle obtained
with all data of each observation therefore may depend
on how the observation covers the orbital phase. In fact,
we can see a large ﬂuctuation of the exposure time over
the orbital phase for the Ni20 data (Figure2).

We examine the orbital evolution of the pulse proﬁles
to investigate the cause of the diﬀerence between the
pulse proﬁles of the X16/18 and Ni20 data. Figure 6
is a dynamic pulse proﬁle folded with the beat frequency
over the orbital phase using the X16 data (left panel)
and the Ni20 data (right panel); the pulse proﬁle at each
orbital phase is created with the data of successive 0.1
orbital phase, and the total count (area of the proﬁle) is
normalized to unity. We can see that the dynamic pulse
proﬁles in two data sets are similar to each other, ex-
cept for feature of the secondary peak appeared at the

pulse proﬁles in the phase segments φo = 0.1 − 0.6 and 0.6 − 1.1, respectively.

beat phase φb ∼ 0 (equivalently φb ∼ 1) and during the
orbital phase φo ∼ 0.5 − 1.

Figure 7 shows the orbital resolved pulse proﬁles for
the X16 (left) and Ni20 (right) data. In both data sets,
the pulse proﬁle at the orbital phase φo ∼ 0.3 can be de-
scribed by a single-peak structure appeared at the beat
phase φb ∼ 0.5. Then the peak position migrates to ear-
lier beat phase during the orbital phase φo ∼ 0.3 − 0.6,
as the dynamic pulse proﬁles indicate. After the orbital
phase φo > 0.6, we can see a double peak structure in
both the X16 and N20 data. For the X16 data, the orig-
inal peak at the beat phase φb ∼ 0.5 always dominates
the secondary peak at φb ∼ 0. For Ni20 data, on the
other hand, the secondary peak has a similar or larger

intensity compared to the original peak. In the bottom
row of the ﬁgure, we present the pulse proﬁles integrated
over the orbital phase φo = 0.1 − 0.6 and φo = 0.6 − 1.1,
respectively. We ﬁnd in the ﬁgure that the pulse proﬁles
in φo = 0.1 − 0.6 for the X16 and Ni20 both can be de-
scribed by a single-peak structure. For φo = 0.6 − 1.1, on
the other hand, the pulse proﬁle of the Ni20 data shows
a double-peak structure with a secondary peak stronger
than the original peak. For the Ni20 data, we can see
that the pulse proﬁle averaged over the orbital phase us-
ing the normalized pulse proﬁles presented in Figure 6
is also described by the double-peak structure. These
results therefore suggest that the diﬀerence between the
pulse proﬁles of the X16/X18 data and Ni20 data is an

intrinsic feature, and the pulsed X-ray emission experi-
ences a long-term evolution.

We deﬁne the pulsed fraction with the equation,
(fmax − fmin)/(fmax + fmin), with fmax and fmin being
the maximum and minimum counts in the light curve.
In 0.3-2.0 keV bands, we obtain 0.13 ± 0.02 for X16,
0.11 ± 0.03 for X18, and 0.20 ± 0.02 for Ni20 data, respec-
tively. We ﬁnd that the pulsed fraction of the Ni20 data
is higher than those of the X16/X18 data. The pulsed
fraction may show a long-term evolution, as well as the
structure of the pulse proﬁle. Although we could not
ﬁnd the pulsed emission above 2 keV bands, we estimate
a pulsed fraction less than 2% on the basis of the spectral
analysis (section 4.3).

3.4. Mixture between spin and beat modulations
In the dynamic pulse proﬁle in Figure 6, we can see
that a migration of the pulse peak position at the orbital
phase φo ∼ 0.2 − 0.5. This migration suggests an exis-
tence of a signal with another period. In fact, the Z 2
2 pe-
riodogram for the Ni20 data (Figure 4) clearly indicates
that a component of the X-ray emission from AR Scorpii
modulates with not only the beat frequency but also the
WD’s spin frequency. Figure 8 presents dynamic pulse
proﬁle folded with the spin frequency (left panel) and in-
tegrated pulse proﬁle (right panel) of the Ni20 data. In
the dynamic pulse proﬁle, we can see a relatively con-
stant peak position in the spin phase during the orbital
phase φo ∼ 0.2 − 0.5. This suggests that the signal of
the WD’s spin frequency appears in the X-ray data only
at a speciﬁc orbital phase interval. As the right panel in
Figure 8 shows, the spin pulse proﬁle integrated over the
orbital phase can be described by a single peak structure,
which is diﬀerent from the double-peak structure of the
beat pulse proﬁle.

We divide the Ni20 data into two orbital intervals,
φo = 0.1 − 0.6 and φo = 0.6 − 1.1, and perform the
Z 2
2 -test for each interval (Figure 9). The periodogram
of the orbital phase φo = 0.1 − 0.6 shows the signal of
the spin frequency that is stronger than the signal of the

beat frequency. During φo = 0.1 − 0.6, moreover, we can
see a strong signal at the average of two frequencies (dot-
ted vertical lines), and the ﬁrst harmonics of the averaged
frequency has a power stronger than those of the 2νb and
2νs in the periodogram. This supports the fact that the
short-term modulation during φo = 0.1 − 0.6 is caused
by the mixture between the beat frequency and spin fre-
quency. For φo = 0.6 − 1.1 (right panel in Figure 9), on
the other hand, no signal of the spin frequency is found
in the Z 2
2 periodogram, and the short-term modulation
is dominated by the beat frequency. We ﬁnd that the ﬁst
harmonic of the beat frequency during the orbital phase
φo = 0.6 − 1.1 shows a Z 2
2 power similar to or stronger
than the power of the fundamental frequency. This is
consistent with the double-peak structure with a phase
separation ∼ 0.5 appeared in the pulse proﬁle folded with
the beat frequency.

We note that the dynamic pulse proﬁle of the X16
data (left panel
in Figure 6) also shows a migration
of the peak position and therefore indicates an appear-
ance of the spin frequency at the orbital phase interval
φo ∼ 0.2 − 0.5. The similar behavior of the X16 and N20
data suggests that the appearance of signal of the WD’s
spin frequency only at a speciﬁc orbital phase interval is
regularly repeated by every orbit. In section 5, we dis-
cuss the mixture between the spin and beat frequencies
in the short-term modulation and its dependency on the
orbital phase.

4. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
The spectrum of the X-ray emission from AR Scor-
pii can be described by an optically thin thermal
plasma emission with several diﬀerent temperatures
(Takata et al. 2018).
In this study, we ﬁt the gener-
ated spectra with a multi-temperature VMEKAL model
(Mewe et al. 1985, 1986) using Xspec version 12.10.1f.
We apply TBABS model for modeling photoelectric ab-
sorption.

4.1.1. Reanalysis for X16 data

Although Takata et al. (2018) ﬁt the spectrum of the
X16 data with a three-temperature VMEKAL model, we
reanalyze the data with the updated calibration ﬁles of
XMM-Newton observation. Table 2 compares the best-
ﬁt parameters reported in Takata et al. (2018) with those
in the new analysis. In Takata et al. (2018) (the second
column), a reasonable ﬁt is obtained by thawing iron
(Fe) abundance and by ﬁxing other elements to the solar
abundance. In our new analysis, however, we ﬁnd that
the reduced χ2 of the ﬁtting with the model (Model 1
in third column) becomes worse comparing to the pre-
vious result, and the best-ﬁt parameters show a smaller
hydrogen column density (NH ).

To ﬁnd a better ﬁtting model, we thaw each element
step by step. We ﬁnd that abundances of another ﬁve
elements (O, Ne, Mg, S and Si) smaller than the solar
abundance signiﬁcantly improve the ﬁtting results with a
F statistic value of 8.2, which means that the probability
of this improvement being caused by chance is 2.3×10−7.
Since the predicted abundances of those components are
consistent with that of the iron within the errors, Table 2

(Model 2) shows the best-ﬁt parameters by linking the
abundances between the iron and the ﬁve elements. We
ﬁnd that the hydrogen column density and two higher
temperatures are consistent with previous result, but the
abundance of the Fe and the lowest temperature decrease
from the previous one.

4.1.2. NICER data

Since NICER has no imaging capability, we check
whether the spectra obtained with the process described
in section 2.4 is indeed consistent with the X-ray emis-
sion from AR Scorpii. We restrict the photon energy
in the 0.3-2 keV band for the spectral analysis of the
NICER data because of strong background contamina-
tion in lower/higher energy bands. We use the Model 2
of Table 2, in which the abundances of O, Ne, Mg, S,
Si and Fe elements are linked. We ﬁnd that the back-
ground subtracted spectrum is reasonably ﬁtted by a
two-temperature VMEKAL model with the best-ﬁt hy-
−0.7 × 1020cm−2, tem-
drogen column density NH = 4.6+0.8
peratures kT1 = 2.6+0.4
−0.06 keV
(χ2
red = 1.15 for 163 dof: third temperature component
is not necessary). The Fe abundance of 0.27+0.11
−0.08 (solar
abundance) is consistent with the result of the X16 data
in Table 2. A simple black-body radiation model or a
power-law model cannot provide a reasonable ﬁt. Hence,
the generated spectrum likely represents the X-ray emis-
sion from AR Scorpii.

−0.4 keV and kT2 = 0.67+0.09

The pulse proﬁles folded with the beat frequency of the
Ni20 data shows a single-peak structure in φ = 0.1 − 0.6
and a double-peak structure in φ = 0.6 − 1.1 (Figure 7).
We therefore create the orbitally resolved spectra for
φo = 0.1 − 0.6 and φo = 0.6 − 1.1, and we check any
orbital evolution of the best-ﬁt parameters with the two-
temperature VMEKAL model. We do not ﬁnd a sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence in the best-ﬁt parameters of two or-
bital phase intervals. This is not unexpected because the
pulsed emission is only ∼10% of the total emission, and

the spectrum is dominated by the un-pulsed component.

4.1.3. Pile-up fraction of Chandra data
First, we use the Web PIMMS Version 4.11 to esti-
mate pile-up fraction of the Chandra data. Since the
Web PIMMS implements the APEC7 model for the plasma
emission, we ﬁt the generated spectrum with a two-
temperature APEC model with the Xspec. Since the
data cannot constrain the hydrogen column density, we
ﬁx it at NH = 3.0 × 1020cm−2. A reasonable ﬁt is ob-
tained with the temperatures kT1 = 5.1+1.2
−0.5 keV, kT2 =
1.0+0.4
−0.3 keV and the iron abundance 0.6+0.2
−0.3 (χ2
red = 1.0
for 107 dof). With the frame time of the observation,
0.8 s, the Web PIMMS estimates the pile-up fraction as
∼ 5 percent. Second, we use the CIAO’s ﬁtting pack-
age, Sherpa, to estimate the pile-up fraction. We ﬁt
the spectrum with a two-temperature VMEKAL compo-
nents plus pile-up model (Davis 2001). The ﬁtting re-
sult shows the plasma temperatures kT1 = 4.1+0.5
−0.5 keV,

kT2 = 0.8+0.3

estimated pile-up fraction is ∼ 5 percent (so called α-
parameter and f -parameter are ∼ 0.8 and 0.89, re-
spectively), which is consistent with the result of the
Web PIMMS.

4.1.4. Joint ﬁtting for X18 and Nu18 data
The observations for the X18 and Nu18 data were car-
ried out on 2018 February 18 and 19, respectively. This
joint observation enables us to investigate X-ray spec-
trum of AR Scorpii over a wide energy range in the 0.2-
78keV bands. In particular, we can investigate the be-
havior of the X-ray spectrum above 10keV bands. We
perform a joint ﬁt for the two spectra by introducing
a constant factor to account for cross-calibration mis-
match between the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR obser-
vations. During the ﬁtting process, we ﬁx the constant
factor for the X18 data at unity, and obtain a constant
factor of ∼ 1.1 for the Nu18 data.

First we ﬁt the spectrum with a three-temperature
VMEKAL model (Model 2 in Table 3), in which we link
the abundances of six elements (O, Ne, Mg, S, Si and Fe)

AR Scorpii over the 0.2-78keV bands.

diﬀerent data sets. We apply the pile-up model imple-
mented in the Xspec, and ﬁt all spectra with the model

for which we turn on the pile-up model only for the
Chandra data.
Since the pile-up parameters α and

those parameters to be the best-ﬁt values 0.8 and 0.89,

respectively, obtained in section 4.1.3. The constant
factors for the X16, Ch17, X18 and Ni20 data are ﬁxed
to unity. We link the abundances of the six elements (O,
Ne, Mg, S, Si and Fe) and ﬁx other elements to the solar
abundances, as discussed in section 4.1.1. A long-term
evolution of the spectral properties is discussed with
following three cases.

First, by assuming a constant plasma temperature and
ﬂux with time, we link the three temperatures and nor-
malization factors for all data sets. We ﬁnd that the
ﬁtting model is unacceptable with a reduced chi-square
of χ2
red ∼ 2.3 for 1232 dof. Then we unlink the normal-
ization factors, but keeping the linking for the temper-
atures. We obtain a reasonable ﬁt with χ2
red ∼ 1.12 for
1216 dof. Table 4 and Figure 10 summarize the best-ﬁt
parameters and spectra, respectively. We ﬁnd that the
best-ﬁt parameters are consistent with the results of the
ﬁtting for the X16 data only (Model 2 in Table 2). In
Table 4, we can see that the 0.3-10 keV unabsorbed ﬂux
deviates from a constant ﬂux with time. One possibility
is an intrinsic temporal evolution of the X-ray emission
of AR Scorpii as indicated by the evolution of the pulse
proﬁle discussed in section 3. For example, we can see

in Table 4 that the normalization factors (N1, N2 and
N3) of the Ni20 data are smaller than the values of the
X16 data, indicating the volume of the emission region
evolves with time.

We also unlink the abundances for the diﬀerent data
sets to see how the best-ﬁt parameters evolve. We ob-
tain the best-ﬁt abundances as Fe = 0.21 ± 0.04 for
X16, 0.33+0.22
−0.15 for Ch17, 0.22 ± 0.04 for X18/Nu18 and
0.54±0.18
−0.13 for Ni20, respectively. The abundance of Ni20
data is higher than those of the other data sets. This may
be due to the fact that the spectrum of Ni20 is limited in
the 0.3-2.0 keV bands, which does not cover the 6.8 keV
line emission from He-like F e, and hence the abundance
of Fe may be overestimated. We can see that other best-
ﬁt parameters are consistent with the results in Table 4
within the errors.

Second, to investigate another possibility that the
change of the X-ray ﬂux is associated with a change of the
temperature of the emitting plasmas, we re-ﬁt the data
by unlinking the lower two temperature components (kT2
and kT3). For the highest temperature, since the Ch17
and Ni20 data sets cannot constrain the value, we keep
the linking. An improvement of the ﬁtting is found with
a F static value 5.5, which means that the probability of
this improvement being caused by chance is ∼ 10−5. Ta-
ble 5 summarizes the best-ﬁt parameters of this model.
The X16, Ch17 and X18/Nu18 data are consistent with
a constant temperature, although the error range for kT2
of Ch17 is large. We ﬁnd however that the lowest tem-
perature kT3 ∼ 0.61 keV of the Ni20 data is higher than
the values kT3 ∼ 0.3 keV of the other data sets, suggest-
ing the plasma temperature shows a temporal evolution.
We ﬁnd that this tendency of the temperatures does not
change, even though we unlink the abundances for the
diﬀerent data sets. In such a case, we obtain the abun-
dances of Fe = 0.25 ± 0.05 for X16, 0.50+0.28
−0.23 for Ch17,
0.23 ± 0.05 for X18/Nu18, and 0.45+0.18
−0.12 for Ni20, respec-
tively.

Finally, we can see in Figure 2 that the diﬀerent obser-
vations were carried out with a diﬀerent exposure distri-
bution over the orbital phase. Since the observed X-ray
emission shows an orbital modulation with a large am-
plitude, it is possible that the diﬀerent coverage over the
orbit produces an apparent long-term evolution of the
ﬂux. To investigate such a possibility, we check orbital

phase-resolved spectra for the X16 and X18 data. As
we can see in Figure 2, the exposure distribution at the
orbital phase φo ∼ 0.35 − 0.85 is relatively uniform for
both X16 and X18 data sets. Hence, we divide the orbital
phase into two intervals, 0−0.35/0.85−1 and 0.35−0.85,
and obtain a spectrum for each orbital interval.

Table 6 summarizes the best-ﬁt parameters with a
three-temperature VMEKAL model; we link the tem-
peratures of the two data sets and the abundances for
6 elements (O, Ne, Mg, S, Si and Fe). In each observa-
tion, we ﬁnd that the ﬂux in φo = 0.35 − 0.85 is higher
than that in φo = 0 − 0.35/0.85 − 1, and the ﬂux aver-
aged over the two phase intervals is consistent with the
ﬂux obtained from the whole data of each observation
(Table 4). In each orbital phase interval, the ﬂux of the
X16 data is higher than that of the X18 data. These
results suggest that the diﬀerence in the exposure dis-
tribution over the orbital phase is not the main reason
of the diﬀerence between the ﬂuxes of the X16 and X18
data sets. Although more concrete evidence is required
with more data, the non-pulsed X-ray emission, as well
as the pulsed emission, of AR Scorpii likely experiences
a long-term evolution on a timescale of years.

4.3. Pulsed spectrum
Takata et al. (2018) examine the spectrum of the
pulsed component with the X16 data and ﬁnd evidence
of a power-law component with a photon index Γ =
2.3 ± 0.5. In the new analysis, we include the X18 and
Ni20 data set, but exclude MOS1/MOS2 data of the
X16/X18 data because of a small amount of the pho-
ton counts. We deﬁne the on-pulse phase and oﬀ-pulse
phase based on the pulse proﬁles folded with the beat
frequency, and we generate the spectrum of the pulsed
component by subtracting the oﬀ-pulse spectrum from
the on-pulse spectrum. As indicated in Figure 5, we de-
ﬁne the on-pulse phase to cover the main peak for the
X16/18 data, and to cover main/secondary peaks for the
Ni20 data. We generate on-pulse and oﬀ-pulse spectra
using the XMMSAS for the X16/X18 data and using the
Xselect for the N20 data. We use the grppha task to
group the spectral bins so that the count in each bin after
subtracting the oﬀ-pulse emission remains >40 photons
for the X16/X18 data and > 100 photons for the Ni20
data.

During the ﬁtting, we ﬁx the hydrogen column den-

−0.08 keV, but we cannot constrain the abun-
dance. The black-body radiation model predicts an emis-
sion size of ∼ 0.1 km with a source distance d ∼ 0.1 kpc,
which is unreasonably small.

Garnavich et al. (2019) ﬁnd that the photon index of
the optical emission varies signiﬁcantly with the orbital
phase and with the emission magnitude. With the cur-
rent X-ray data quality, however, it is diﬃcult to inves-
tigate such a dependency of the properties of the pulsed
emission on the beat phase or on the orbital phase.

As discussed in section 3, we cannot ﬁnd the beat sig-
nal in the > 2 keV band. If the spectrum of the pulsed
emission could extend beyond 2 keV band with a power-
law distribution, the expected ﬂux in the 2-10 keV band
−0.8 × 10−14 erg cm−2s−1, which is
is F2−10 keV = 3.2+1.2
∼ 2% of the total emission in the 2-10 keV band. Using
all data sets, we have a total of ∼55,000 events in the
>2 keV band. Since the background emission dominates
in the >2 keV band of the Ni20 data, the events related
to the pulsed emission will be much less than ∼1,100.
With current collected photon counts, therefore, the sig-
niﬁcance of the pulsation in the > 2 keV band will be too
small to be detected (i.e., < 5σ), even if the power-law
component extends to that energy band.

5. SUMARY AND DISCUSSION
We have studied the X-ray emission from AR Scorpii
with the archival data taken in 2016-2020. In the short-

term modulation, the periodogram using the Ni20 data
clearly indicates a modulation of the spin frequency of
WD, indicating that part of the X-ray emission is coming
from the WD’s magnetosphere. The short term modu-
lation during the orbital phase φo ∼ 0.1 − 0.6 is caused
by the mixture between the beat frequency and the spin
frequency, while the intensity peak during φo ∼ 0.6 − 1.1
is regularly repeated with the beat frequency. The X16
data also indicates such a modulation behavior over the
orbital phase. Hence, the appearance of the WD’s spin
frequency in the X-ray emission only at the speciﬁc or-

term variation, we ﬁnd that the observed ﬂux level in
2016/2017 was higher than those measured in 2018/2020,
and the amplitude of the orbital waveform of the 2020
NICER data might be larger than those of other data
sets taken in 2016-2018. Moreover, the beat pulse proﬁle
averaged over the orbital phase changed from a single-
peak structure in 2016/2018 to a double-peak structure
in 2020. These results suggest that the X-ray emission
from AR Scorpii experiences a long-term evolution on a
timescale of years. The spectrum of the pulsed emission
can be ﬁt by a power-law function with a photon index
Γ ∼ 0.25 − 0.31.

A mixture of the beat frequency and the spin fre-
quency in the short-term modulation is also observed
in the optical emission from AR Scorpii (Marsh et al.
2016; Potter & Buckley 2018a,b). According to the ﬁg-
ure 3 in Potter & Buckley (2018b) (the periodogram of
the optical data), the beat signal is much stronger than
the spin signal in the optical band. In the X-ray bands,
the signal of the WD’s spin frequency during the orbital
phase φo ∼ 0.1 − 0.6 is similar strength to or may be
stronger than that of the beat frequency, while the signal
of the spin frequency disappears during the orbital phase
φo ∼ 0.6 − 1, 1, as we discussed in section 3. This shows
that a component of the X-ray emission modulating with
the WD spin frequency appears and disappears in the ob-
servation over the orbital phase. We may interpret the
signal of the beat frequency and the spin frequency in the
X-ray emission as a result of the synchrotron emission
from two kind of the electron populations characterized
by a larger and a smaller pitch angles, respectively. A
brief discussion of this interpretation is as follows.

We assume a non-thermal emission process for the ob-
served X-ray emission modulating with the spin and/or
beat frequencies. The non-thermal process of AR Scorpii
has been discussed that an interaction between the mag-
netosphere of the WD and companion star may form
a bow shock or cause a magnetic dissipation process,
which could accelerate the electrons from the companion
star (Geng et al. 2016; Buckley et al. 2017; Takata et al.
2017; Singh et al. 2020). Garnavich et al. (2019) and
Lyutikov et al. (2020), on the other hand, propose that it
is related to the magnetic reconnection event in the mag-
netosphere of the WD because of the interaction with
the ﬂow from the companion star. Bednarek (2018) pro-
poses a hadronic model, in which the electrons and pro-
tons are accelerated in a strongly magnetized turbulent
region around the M-type star, and the primary elec-
trons and/or secondary electron/positron pairs produce
a non-thermal emission from AR Scorpii. We assume
that the accelerated electrons at the interaction region
are trapped in the WD magnetosphere and, produce the

 
 
 
non-thermal emission through the synchrotron radiation.
The modulation of the beat frequency has been in-
terpreted that the energy and/or particle injection for
the synchrotron radiation is enhanced when the magnetic
pole points toward the companion star (Geng et al. 2016;
Potter & Buckley 2018b). Takata et al. (2017) suggest
on the other hand that the synchrotron emission around
the magnetic mirror points, where the pitch angle of the
electrons becomes 90 degree, produces a pulsed emission.
In their model, if the WD’s magnetic pole is inclined from
the spin axis, the electrons injected into the WD’s mag-
netosphere at diﬀerent spin/beat phases migrate to the
ﬁrst magnetic mirror points with diﬀerent travel times.
With the eﬀect of the travel times, the emission from dif-
ferent magnetic mirror points can enhance the observed
intensity at certain spin/beat phase, and results in the
formation of the pulse. This model expects that the pulse
proﬁle evolves over the orbital phase, because the posi-
tion of the WD relative to the companion star measured
from the Earth depends on the orbital phase.

In the observed X-ray emisison, the modulation with
the WD’s spin frequency appears only at a speciﬁc or-
bital phase interval. Potter & Buckley (2018b) discuss
synchrotron radiation from a region ﬁxed in the WD’s
magnetosphere to explain the optical pulsed emission
from AR Scorpii. They demonstrate that by choosing
an appropriate pitch angle of the synchrotron radiation,
the pulsed emission modulating with the spin frequency
appears brighter during the orbital phase φo ∼ 0.2 − 0.45
only, because of a beaming eﬀect of the synchrotron ra-
diation. Our speculative interpretation therefore is that
the pulsed X-ray emission of AR Scorpii are produced
by two kinds of the electron populations; electrons hav-
ing a larger pitch angle and one having a smaller pitch
angle. The emission that modulates with the beat fre-
quency is produced by the population with a larger pitch
angle, while the emission that modulates with the spin
frequency is produced by the population with a smaller
pitch angle.

The electrons that are injected from the interaction
region will initially move toward the WD surface along
the magnetic ﬁled line. Because of the conservation of
the ﬁrst adiabatic invariance, the pitch angle increases as
the electrons approach to the WD surface, because the
strength of the magnetic ﬁeld increases. If the electrons
with a pitch angle θ0 are injected into the WD magne-
tosphere at a radius distance a from the WD, the pitch
angle will evolve with the radial distance, r, measured
from the WD as

(cid:16)
where we assume a magnetic dipole ﬁeld and ignore a
change of the Lorentz factor due to the synchrotron ra-
diation loss. The electrons injected with a larger pitch
angle will lose their energy at or near the magnetic mir-
ror point. Since the emission from the electrons with a
larger pitch angle covers a wider area in the sky, it can be
observable over the orbital phase. We expect that such
an emission modulates with the beat frequency.

For the electrons injected with a smaller pitch angle, on
the other hand, they can move in the deeper WD’s mag-
netosphere while keeping a small pitch angle. If the mag-
netic ﬁeld is strong enough, the electrons may lose their

13

energy through the synchrotron radiation before reach-
ing the magnetic mirror points. A simple quantitative
estimation is the following. As an electron moves along
the dipole magnetic ﬁeld line toward the WD, the syn-
chrotron loss timescale (τsyn) decreases since the pitch
angle and magnetic ﬁeld strength increase. When the
synchrotron loss timescale becomes of the order of the
dynamic timescale, τc = r/c, the electrons signiﬁcantly
lose the energy. By equating τsyn = τc, and using the
equation (1), we estimate the Lorentz factor of the elec-
tron (i) that are injected with a pitch angle θ0 at r = a
and (ii) that emit the typical synchrotron photon energy

We may apply µW D = 5 × 1034 G cm3 and
RW D = 109 cm for the WD parameters of AR Scorpii
(Buckley et al. 2017), and a = 8 × 108 cm of the separa-
tion between centers of two stars as the injection distance
(since the companion star, whose radius is ∼ 2×1010 cm,
occupies a large portion of the space between centers
of the two stars, this distance of the injection may be
a crude approximation). Then, if the initial pitch an-
gle is very small, for example sin θ0 = 0.01, we obtain
γ ∼ 9000, sin θ(rs) ∼ 0.06 and rs = 2 × 1010cm, re-
spectively, for the photon energy Esyn = 1 keV. Such
an electron therefore loses the energy while keeping the
small pitch angle. The emission from the small pitch an-
gle approximately directs along the magnetic ﬁeld line,
and it is observable by the observer whose line of sight is
parallel to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld at the ra-
dial distance rs. We expect that the X-ray emission from
such a small pitch angle is observed only at a speciﬁc
spin phase interval (like the pulsar emission) and hence
the observed emission modulates with the spin frequency.
The detectability of the emission from a small pitch
angle for AR Scorpii will depend on the orbital phase
because of the beaming eﬀect. We assume that new
high-energy electrons on a WD’s magnetic ﬁeld line are
injected when the magnetic ﬁeld line interacts with the
companion star magnetosphere/outﬂow. Since the dy-
namical timescale (∼ one second) and the synchrotron
timescale at the emission point are much shorter than
the WD’s spin period, we anticipate that, in terms of the
spin phase, the ejected electrons immediately lose most
of their energy after the injection. At a speciﬁc orbital
phase interval, therefore, if there is no electron injection
when the magnetic ﬁeld at the distance rs directs toward

14

the observer, we cannot observe the X-ray emission mod-
ulating with the WD’s spin. This beaming eﬀect could
explain why the signal of the WD’s spin frequency in the
observed X-ray emission appears and disappears over the
orbital phase.

Finally, another unique property is that AR Scorpii

particular, the X-ray light curve folded with the beat fre-
quency clearly indicates an evolution of the pulsed com-
ponent on a time-scale of years. This evolution could be
caused either by an ﬂuctuation or secular evolution of
the state of the system. The change of the pulse proﬁle
and orbital modulation have been discovered in the X-
ray emission from an intermediate polar (IP), XY Arietis
(Norton & Mukai 2007), which is the accreting magnetic
white dwarf, and the observed X-ray emission mainly
originates from the white dwarf surface hit by the accre-
tion ﬂow. XY Arietis experienced an outburst because
of a substantial increase of the accretion rate in 1996
(Hellier et al. 1997), and the increase of the mass transfer
was probably caused by a result of a thermal-viscous disk
instability (Hameury & Lasota 2017) or an enhancement
mass transfer rate from the companion star. Hellier et al.
(1997) report that the spin pulse proﬁle evolved from a
double-peaked proﬁle to a single-peaked proﬁle during
the outburst. Norton & Mukai (2007) ﬁnd that the spin
pulse proﬁle and the orbital waveform of XY Arietis also
show a long-term evolution in the quiescent state. They
interpret the long-term evolution in quiescent state with
a precession model of an accretion disk.

AR Scorpii is a diﬀerent type of WD’s binary system
from the IP in the sense that there is no accretion disk
in the system and the pulsed X-ray emission is likely
produced by the synchrotron radiation of the relativis-

expected that the modulation peak in the beat phase
occurs when the magnetic poles direct toward the com-
panion star. The double peak structure of the Ni20 data
(and optical data) with a phase separation ∼ 0.5 im-
plies the emission from the northern and southern hemi-
spheres. The single-peak structure observed in the X16

and X18 data may indicate that the X-ray emission from
one hemisphere in 2016/2018 was intrinsically dim be-
cause of an anisotropic energy injection from the inter-
action region. If this interpretation is true, the emerging
secondary peak in the Ni20 data might be due to an in-
crease of the energy injection to the hemisphere.

Another possible interpretation can be that the X-ray
emission from one hemisphere was geometrically invisible
in 2016/2018 observations, and it became visible in 2020.
This interpretation could be possible if the spin axis of
the WD is precessing. Schwarzenberg-Czerny (1992) es-
timate the precession period would be ∼ 104 − 105 times
the WD’s spin period, which depends on the oblateness of
the star. Katz (2017) applies the precession model to ex-
plain the orbital waveform in the optical bands, and pre-
dicts a precession period of 20-200 years for AR Scorpii.
Tovmassian et al. (2007, 2012) report an evidence of the
WD’s precession in the X-ray emission from two IPs. If
this precession scenario is true for AR Scorpii, the transi-
tion between a single-peak and a double-peak structures
in the pulse proﬁle folded with the beat frequency will be
regularly repeated with the precession frequency. Since
the pulse peak in the X-ray bands is aligned with the
peak in the optical/UV bands, more long-term multi-
wavelength observations will be required to understand
the origin of the long-term evolution of the emission from
AR Scorpii.
