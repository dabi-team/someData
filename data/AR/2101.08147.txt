(Dated: 21 January 2021)

The vibrational quenching cross sections and corresponding low-temperature rate constants for the ν = 1 and ν = 2
states of CN−(1Σ+) colliding with He and Ar atoms have been computed ab initio using new three dimensional potential
energy surfaces. Little work has so far been carried out on low-energy vibrationally inelastic collisions for anions with
neutral atoms. The cross sections and rates calculated at energies and temperatures relevant for both ion traps and
astrochemical modelling, are found by the present calculations to be even smaller than those of the similar C−
2 /He and
C−
2 /Ar systems which are in turn of the order of those existing for the collisions involving neutral diatom-atom systems.
The implications of our ﬁnding in the present case rather small computed rate constants are discussed for their possible
role in the dynamics of molecular cooling and in the evolution of astrochemical modelling networks.

INTRODUCTION

Vibrationally inelastic collisions are fundamental processes
in chemical physics and molecular dynamics. Gas phase col-
lisions which can excite or quench a vibrational mode in a
molecule have been studied both experimentally and theoreti-
cally for decades1–5 and are generally well understood. Typi-
cally the scattering cross sections and corresponding rates are
relatively small6 due to the generally large energy spacing
between vibrational levels which require strong interaction
forces between the colliding species to induce transitions. On
the other hand, these processes still attract a great deal of at-
tention and study as they have important applications in ﬁelds
such as cold molecules, where collisions are used to quench
internal molecular motion,7–9 or astrochemistry, where accu-
rate rate constants are necessary to model the evolution of gas
clouds and atmospheres.10–14 There are also exceptional sys-
tems such as the dramatic case of BaCl+ + Ca where laser
cooled calcium atoms can efﬁciently quench vibrational mo-
tion with rates similar to rotational transitions.9,15

There continues to be many studies of diatom-atom vi-
brationally inelastic collisions for both neutral7,11,16,17 and
cationic species.15,18–20 This is to be contrasted by with the
case for anions, where very little work has been carried out
on vibrationally inelastic collision processes. Recently we
have tried to change this trend and have investigated vibra-
tional quenching of the C−
2 anion in collisions with noble gas
atoms.21 This molecule is of direct interest as a possible can-
didate for laser cooling mechanisms22 but a ﬁrst step will re-
quire the cooling of internal motion via collisions since spon-
taneous dipole emission is forbidden for the rovibrational ex-
cited states of this homonuclear species. The cross sections
and rate constants for vibrational transitions were found by
our calculations to be small, i.e. of the order of those for neu-
tral species.

In this article we report the vibrational quenching of yet
another important anion, CN− in collisions with He and Ar
atoms. The cyanide anion is a well studied molecule, par-
ticularly its spectroscopic properties have attracted a great
deal of attention and investigations23–28 as well as the de-
termination of its photodetachment energy23,29,30. Recent
work in our group has further clariﬁed important aspects of
its photodetachment behaviour at threshold from cold trap
experiments.31 This molecule has also been detected in the
envelope of a carbon star32 after its rotational constants were
carefully measured.25 Collisional processes of the anion with
the astrochemically relevant He and H2 species33,34 for ro-
tational transitions have recently been studied and we have
also investigated the rotational cooling of this molecular an-
ion with He, Ar and H2 as buffer gasses.35 The CN− anion
is also thought to be an important participant as well in reac-
tions in the interstellar medium36–39 and in the atmosphere of
Titan40 where it has been detected.41,42

We note in passing that the corresponding neutral species
CN was one of the ﬁrst molecules to be detected in space43
and cross sections and rates for this species have been investi-
gated and obtained for various ro-vibrational processes in col-
lisions with He and H2.16,44–49 The cyanide cation is also sus-
pected to be important to astrochemical processes but has yet
to be detected. The cation’s vibrational energies have recently
been measured50 as well as a study has been carried out on its
rotational transitions induced by He collisions.51

Vibrationally inelastic collisions involving the CN− molec-
ular anion with neutral atoms are a type of process rarely stud-
ied for such systems. Although CN− can of course lose energy
through spontaneous emission, its wide relevance justiﬁes
providing an accurate assessment of the vibrational quench-
ing processes involving He and Ar, typical buffer gases in ion
traps.

The paper is organised as follows: Section II presents the
CN− potential energy and dipole moment curves along with
the anion’s vibrational energy levels and Einstein A coefﬁ-
cients. The potential energy surfaces for the CN−/He and
CN−/Ar systems are then discussed in Section III. The quan-

CN− POTENTIAL ENERGY CURVE AND DIPOLE

MOMENT

Electronic energies for the ground 1Σ+ state of the CN−
anion were calculated at 19 internuclear distances r to obtain
the anion’s potential energy curve (PEC). Calculations were
carried out using the MOLPRO suite of quantum chemistry
codes52,53 at the CCSD(T) level of theory54,55 employing an
aug-cc-pV5Z basis set.56,57 The expectation value of the non-
relaxed CCSD dipole moment at each r distance was also
obtained. The ab initio energies and dipole moment curve
(DMC) for CN− are shown in Fig. 1.

The LEVEL program58 was used to obtain the vibrational
energies and wavefunctions, for the CN− molecule. The ab
initio energies were used as input, interpolated using a cu-
bic spline and extrapolated to r values below and above the
range of calculated energies using functions implemented in
LEVEL. The relative energies of the ﬁrst three vibrational lev-
els along with the rotational constants for each state are shown
in Table I and compared with previously published calculated
theoretical and experiment values. The agreement with pre-
vious calculations and experimental values is quite good and
certainly sufﬁcient to evaluate the cross sections and rates con-
stants of inelastic collisions considered below.

We have recently evaluated the dipole moment of CN− at
its equilibrium bond length req using a variety of ab initio
methods and basis sets33 and used it to evaluate the Einstein
A coefﬁcients for pure rotational transitions. The best esti-
mate of that work of 0.71 D is in quite good agreement with
the value of the DMC at re of 0.65 D computed here. The
LEVEL program was also used to calculate the Einstein A
coefﬁcients for ro-vibrational transitions of CN− using the ab
initio calculated DMC. The values of Aν′ j′,ν′′ j′′ for the ﬁrst two
vibrational states of the anion are shown in Table II and com-

SURFACES AND VIBRATIONALLY AVERAGED MATRIX
ELEMENTS

The interaction energies between CN− in its ground 1Σ+
electronic state with He and Ar atoms were calculated us-
ing ab initio methods implemented in the MOLPRO suite of
codes.52,53 Geometries were deﬁned on a Jacobi grid with R
(the distance from the centre of mass of CN− to the atom)
ranging from 2.5 to 20 Å and θ (the angle between R and the
CN− internuclear axis r) from 0 (C side) to 180◦ in 15◦ and
10◦ intervals for He and Ar respectively. Seven values of the
CN− bond length for each system between r = 1.00-1.42 Å
were used including the equilibrium value of req = 1.181431
Å. This is sufﬁcient to cover the vibrational levels of interest
in the present study. Interaction potential energies between
CN− and the noble gas atoms were determined by subtracting
the asymptotic energies for each bond length.

For CN−/He, energies were calculated using the Multi-
conﬁgurational self-consistent ﬁeld (MCSCF) method60,61
with 8 occupied orbitals and 2 closed orbitals followed by
a 1-state multi-reference conﬁguration interaction (MRCI)62
calculation. An aug-cc-pV5Z basis63 was employed. In our

earlier discussion of the CN-/He PES33 we discuss in detail
the reasons why we followed both methods for this system
and compared the CASSCF+MRCI results with the CCSD(T)
with similar basis set expansions, ﬁnding them to be coin-
cident in values.
In particular, we corrected for the size-
consistency possible shortcomings of the CASSCF+MRCI vs
the CCSD(T) methods by correcting the latter results using
the Davidson´s correction as implemented in MOLPRO. In
our earlier work33 we showed that this correction brought the
two sets of potential calculations to yield the same potential
values over a broad range of the employed grid. As an exam-
ple, we note here that from our CBS (Complete Basis Set) ex-
trapolated CCSD(T) calculations on CN−/He system we ﬁnd
the minimum energy conﬁguration as theta=40 deg., R=3.95
Å with BSSE corrected energy at 49.522 cm−1. CBS is calcu-
lated by the default procedure in MOLPRO: it is the so-called
L3 extrapolation discussed in there. The results within the
CAS(8,4) within the CASSCF+MRCI gave a theta=40 deg.,
R=4.00 and an energy of 50.39 cm−1 for its minimum conﬁg-
uration, showing the two methods to provide essentially the
same results.

For the CN−/Ar system, energies were calculated using the
CCSD(T) method55 with complete basis set (CBS) extrapola-
tion using the aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pV5Z
basis sets.56,64 The basis-set-superposition-error (BSSE) was
also accounted for all calculated points using the counterpoise
procedure.65

The three-dimensional PESs were ﬁt to an analytical form
using the method of Werner, Follmeg and Alexander11,66

where Nr = 7 and Nθ = 13 or 19 respectively are the number

are the Legendre polynomials and req = 1.181431 Å is the
equilibrium bond length of CN−. For each bond length rm

where the ﬁrst terms account for the short range part of the
potential and the second part for the long range terms com-
bined using the 1
2 [1 + tanh(R)] switching function. For each
rm and θk Eq. 2 was least squares ﬁt to the ab initio data
(around 40 R points) using imax = 2, jmin = 4 and jmax = 10
for eight variable parameters. The average root-mean-square
error (RMSE) for each ﬁt was 0.21 cm−1 for CN−/He and
0.27 cm−1 for CN−/Ar. From the 1D potential ﬁts Bkm(R),
the radial coefﬁcients Aln(R) can be determined from the ma-
trix product A(R) = P−1B(R)S−1 where the matrix elements
of P and S are given as Pkl = Pl(cosθk) and Snm = (rm − req)n
respectively. The analytical representation of the PES, Eq.
1, gives a reasonable representation of the ab initio interac-
tion energies. An overall RMSE of 82 cm−1 for all points
used in the ﬁt was obtained for CN−/He but this drops to 0.26

 
 
 
 
cm−1 for V < 500 cm−1. For CN−/Ar an overall RMSE of 21
cm−1 was obtained, a value which went down to 1.5 cm−1 for
V < 500 cm−1.

The scattering calculations described in the next section re-
quire the interaction potential to be averaged over the vibra-
tional states of CN− χν(r), which were obtained from LEVEL
as described in Section II, as

Vν,ν′(R,θ) = hχν(r)|Vint(R, r,θ)|χν′ (r)i.

(3)

Fig. 2 shows the diagonal terms V0,0(R,θ) for both sys-
tems. As expected for a molecule with a strong bond, so that
the ground state vibrational wavefunction is strongly peaked
around req, the contour plots of the V0,0(R,θ) for each system
are very similar to our earlier rigid-rotor (RR) PESs which
were obtained without the vibrational averaging.33,35 Both
system’s PES have a fairly similar appearance with the most
attractive part of the potential located on the nitrogen end of
CN−. The well depth is the main difference which increases
as expected from He to Ar due to the increasing number of
electrons on the atoms and on the much larger dipole polar-
izabiliy that dominates the long-range attractive terms with a
value of 1.383 a3

0 for He and 11.070 a3

0 for Ar.67

The off diagonal V0,1(R,θ) terms which directly drive vi-
brationally inelastic ν = 1 to ν = 0 transitions are also shown
in Fig. 2. At short distances the coupling terms are repul-
sive, becoming negligible rather quickly at longer distances,
as is the case for many other atom-diatom systems where the
vibrational coupling features are largely short-range coupling
regions. The interaction of CN− with Ar is more repulsive at
close range and for a broader range of geometries than is the
case for He. These ﬁndings suggest already that low-energy
collisions with Ar will be likely to induce larger vibrational
cross sections than for the same collisions involving He atoms.
Such expected behaviour will be in fact conﬁrmed below by
our actual calculations.

The PESs for CN−/He and CN−/Ar can be compared to
similar systems such as C−
2 /He and C−
2 /Ar which we have re-
cently investigated.21 The location of the minimum interaction
energy for both anions interacting with He and Ar respectively
are very similar with the main different being the perpendicu-
lar angle of the well for C−
2 . The off-diagonal matrix elements
for these systems are also similar in magnitude and range but
being slightly larger for the interaction of He and Ar with C−
2 ,
explaining the larger quenching rates for this anion (see be-
low). The PES for the corresponding neutral systems CN/He
and CN/Ar which were reported by Saidani et al. can also be
compared.68 In this case the well depth for He interacting with
both CN and CN− is similar but for Ar the interaction with the
anion is somewhat weaker. As expected the interaction poten-
tial for He and Ar interacting with the anion extends further
than the corresponding neutral systems. The off-diagonal ele-
ments for the neutral and anionic systems are broadly similar.

The close-coupling (CC) scattering calculations to be dis-
cussed in the next section require to have the vibrationally av-
eraged matrix elements in the form of the familiar multipole

Fig. 3 shows the multipole expansion coefﬁcients for the ﬁrst
three V0,0(R,θ) terms for both systems. As anticipated from
the broad spatial similarity of the contour plots, the multipole
expansion for the vibrationally averaged matrix elements are
very close to those obtained from considering the anion as a
rigid rotor. This justiﬁes our previous treatment of purely ro-
tationally inelastic transitions where we considered the anion
to behave as a rigid rotor (RR)33,35 and we refer the reader to
these works for a discussion of pure rotational transitions.

It is also worthy of note about the diagonal coupling matrix
elements reported in that Fig. 3 how the much more polar-
izable Ar projectile gives the three lowest multipolar terms
as attractive contributions to the interaction, thereby indicat-
ing that their collective effects during the interaction would
be to draw the heavier partner closer to the anion. On the
other hand, the same three coefﬁcients for the lighter He part-
ner (left-hand panel in Fig. 3) exhibit much shallower attrac-
tive wells and only for two of the coefﬁcients, with the λ =
1 coefﬁcient showing instead a slightly repulsive behaviour at
intermediate distances.

The off-diagonal expansion coefﬁcients V λ

0,1 are shown in
Fig. 4. All terms quickly approach zero as R is increased.
For both systems the V λ
0,1(R) coefﬁcients are mostly steeply
repulsive as R decreases. As expected from the contour plots,
the V λ
0,1(R) terms are seen to be much more repulsive for the
CN−/Ar interaction, with their turning points located at larger
distances than happens for the He partner. Such features of
the interactions again suggest a larger dynamical vibrational
inelasticity for the case of Ar atoms than for the He collision
partners.

IV. QUANTUM SCATTERING CALCULATIONS

Quantum scattering calculations were carried out using the
coupled channel (CC) method to solve the Schrödinger equa-
tion for scattering of an atom with a diatomic molecule as
implemented in our in-house code, ASPIN.69 The method has
been described in detail many times before, from one of its
earliest, now classic formulations70 to one of its more recent,
computation-oriented visitation from our own work69. There-
fore, only a brief summary of the method will be given here
with all equations given in atomic units. By starting with
the form employed for any given total angular momentum

dial part of the ro-vibrational eigenfunctions of the molecule.
The values of l and j are constrained, via Clebsch-Gordan co-
efﬁcients, such that their ﬁnal summation is compatible with

also used: for both systems it included up to j = 20 rotational
functions for each vibrational state. The CC equations were
propagated between 1.7 and 100.0 Å using the log-derivative
propagator71 up to 60 Å and the variable-phase method at
larger distances.72 The potential energy was interpolated be-
tween calculated V λ
ν,ν′ (R) values using a cubic spline. For
R < 2.5 Å the V λ
R + bλR while
for R > 20 Å the λ = 0 terms were extrapolated as c
R4 + d
R6 . As
our ab initio calculated interaction energies were computed to
R = 25 Å where the interaction energy is negligible for the
temperatures of interest here, the extrapolated form has also a
negligible effect on cross sections.73

ν,ν′(R) were extrapolated as aλ

A number of parameters of the calculation were checked for
convergence. The scattering cross sections differed by around
10-15% on going from 10 to 19 λ terms. This is less pre-
cise than for rotationally inelastic cross sections where con-
vergence to around 1% is typical and is due to the very small
cross sections for these processes which makes obtaining pre-
cise and stable values more difﬁcult to achieve. For produc-
tion calculations, 10 λ terms were included for each Vν,ν′ (R)
as a compromise between accuracy and computational time.
The effect of the vibrational basis set was also considered.
It was found that for the ν = 1 and ν = 2 levels, which are
the states of interest here (see next section), it was sufﬁcient

to only include these states. Including the ν = 3 state had a
negligible effect on the ν = 1 and ν = 2 quenching cross sec-
tions. The rotational j = 20 basis gave convergence to better
than 1% for the CN−/He while for CN−/Ar convergence to
about 10% was achieved.

Scattering calculations were carried out for collision ener-
gies between 1 and 1000 cm−1 using steps of 0.1 cm−1 for en-
ergies up to 100 cm−1, 0.2 cm−1 for 100-300 cm−1, 1.0 cm−1
for 300-500 cm−1 and 10.0 cm−1 for 500-1000 cm−1. This
energy grid was used to ensure that important features such as
resonances appearing in the cross sections were accounted for
and their contributions included when the corresponding rates
were calculated. At low collision energies, the positions and
widths of such resonances will be very sensitive to the details
of the PES.

For CN−/Ar the number of partial waves was increased
with increasing energy as usual, requiring J = 120 for the
highest energies considered. For the CN−/He system how-
ever, inverse behaviour was encountered: at low scattering
energies below 100 cm−1, more partial was were required (up
to J = 80) to converge the vibrationally inelastic partial cross
sections than at higher energies where only up to J = 35 was
required. We suspect this is due to the very small cross sec-
tions so that at low energies it becomes difﬁcult to converge
the calculations as all partial waves contribute uniformly very
small values so that many more of them need inclusion for an
acceptable convergent behaviour to occur.

Vibrationally inelastic cross sections were computed for the
ν = 1 and ν = 2 states of CN− for collisions with He. Due
to time and memory constraints, only ν = 1 states of CN−
were considered for Ar collisions. We think, however, that
such calculations are already sufﬁcient for our results to make
convincingly our main points, as discussed further below.

V. VIBRATIONALLY INELASTIC CROSS SECTIONS &
RATE COEFFICIENTS

Fig. 5 compares vibrationally inelastic rotationally elastic
(for j = j′ = 0) cross sections for the de-excitation ν = 1 →
ν = 0, ν = 2 → ν = 1 and ν = 2 → ν = 0 transitions for CN−
colliding with He and ν = 1 → ν = 0 for CN−/Ar. At low
collisions energies below 100 cm−1 the cross sections for He
are very small, orders of magnitude less than rotationally in-
elastic collisions for this system.33 The cross sections show
resonances at lower collision energies due to shape and/or
Feshbach resonances. As expected due to the larger energy
difference, the ν = 2 → ν = 0 process is smaller than the
ν = 2 → ν = 1 and ν = 1 → ν = 0 cross sections. At collision
energies above 100 cm−1, the cross sections rapidly increase
in value, a behaviour typically observed also in other systems
for vibrationally inelastic cross sections.11–14

The CN−/Ar cross sections are found to be about four or-
ders of magnitude larger than those we have obtained for He
at lower energies, also showing many distinct resonance fea-
tures which are brought about by the presence of a stronger
interaction with the molecular anion. The detailed analysis of
such a forest of resonances would also be interesting and per-
haps would be warranted in the case of existing experimental
data on such processes, of which we are not aware till now,
but would require a substantial extension of the present work.
Thus, we do not intend to carry it out now, being somewhat
outside the main scope of the present study, and are leaving it
for future extension of this study in our own laboratory.

The far larger cross sections we found for the Ar projec-
tile are obviously a consequence of the deeper attractive well
for the Vν,ν(R,θ) diagonal matrix elements and the larger off-
diagonal Vν,ν′ (R,θ) matrix elements (see Fig. 2), i.e.
they
stem from distinct differences in the strengths of the coupling
potential terms that drive the inelastic dynamics for the Ar
collision partner.

The general features of the vibrationally inelastic cross sec-
tions shown in Fig. 5 are indeed similar to those which we
have obtained earlier for the C−
2 anion colliding with He, Ne
and Ar set of systems that we have recently studied.21 For
both of the anions, we have found that the vibrational quench-
ing cross sections with He are uniformly very small, while we
also found that they increase by orders of magnitude when the
larger and more polarizable Ar atom becomes the collisional
partner for either of these anionic molecules. Although such
general behaviour could be reasonably expected from what we
know in these systems about their interaction forces, it is nev-
ertheless reassuring to obtain quantitative conﬁrmation on the
extent of the size differences from detailed, and in principle
exact, scattering calculations.

The computed inelastic cross sections of the previous sec-
tion can in turn be used to obtain the corresponding thermal
rate constants over ranges of temperature of interest for plac-
ing the present anion in cold environments. The correspond-
ing kν→ν′(T ) can be evaluated, in fact, as the convolution of
the computed inelastic cross sections over a Boltzmann dis-
tribution of the relative collision energies of the interacting
partners as

where Ec = µv2/2 is the kinetic energy in the collision calcu-
lations. The rate constants were computed between 5 and 100
K in 1 K intervals. Fig. 6 shows the rates for vibrationally in-
elastic rotationally elastic ( j = j′ = 0) transitions correspond-
ing to the cross sections in Fig. 5. The ﬁgure also shows
rates for the corresponding transitions of the similar C−
2 /He
and Ar systems. For CN−/He the rate constants for vibrational
quenching are very small, even lower than those for C−
2 /He
and around nine orders of magnitude lower than those for
CN−/He rotationally inelastic collisions.33 For CN−/Ar the
ν = 1 → ν = 0 rate constants are about four orders of magni-
tude larger than those for He but about three orders of magni-
tude less than for the corresponding transition for C−
2 /Ar. The
ν = 2 → ν = 1 rate constants for CN−/He is broadly similar to
those for ν = 1 → ν = 0 while as expected the ν = 2 → ν = 0
rate constants are slightly smaller.

The increase in rate constants on going from He to Ar in
collisions are similar to what was found for rotationally in-
elastic collisions for CN−35 and C−
74 and as shown in Fig. 6,
2
vibrationally inelastic collisions for C−
2 .21 This trend, while
seemingly in expectation with the stronger interaction poten-
tial for the larger atom is not easy to predict a priori. Kato et
al. and Ferguson measured vibrational quenching rates for N+
2
in collisions with He, Ne, Ar, Xe and Kr75 and O+
2 with He,
Ne and Ar atoms76 respectively at 300 K. For both cations,
quenching rates increased with the size of atom, suggesting
that the polarizability of the colliding atom plays an impor-
tant role. In contrast Saidani et al calculated quenching rates
for CN with He and Ar over a wide range of temperatures

and found that cross sections and rates for Ar were orders
of magnitude lower than those for He.68 However, ionic in-
teractions are driven by different forces than those acting be-
tween neutrals, so it is not obvious how such a result relates
to the present ﬁndings for an anion. Analytical models can
also be used to gain insight into vibrational quenching such as
the work of Dashevskaya et al. where the quenching rate for
ν = 1 → ν = 0 for N2/He was calculated over a large range of
temperatures from 70-3000 K.77 The rates obtained were in
good agreement with experiment and similar to those found
here for CN−/He at 100 K. It would be interesting to apply
these models to the anion-neutral collisions of interest here.

The work we have presented here, and the similar ﬁndings
from our previous study21 on a different diatomic anion like
C−
2 , strongly suggests that the process of vibrational inelas-
ticity in multiply bonded anionic molecules by low-T colli-
sions with neutral noble gases is rather inefﬁcient. The rates
for quenching found here are even smaller than those we had
found earlier for C−
2 , also uniformly smaller than those known
for many neutral diatomic molecules and cations21.

The quenching rates and Einstein A coefﬁcients which we
have mentioned and shown earlier in this work, can be used to
consider the properties of the critical density ni

vibrations which is given as

In the present case of CN−/He, when we apply Eq. 13 to
the ν = 1 and ν = 2 vibrational state-changing process gives
ni
crit(T ) ≈ 1019 − 1020 cm−3 at 100 K. Current kinetics mod-
els which describe the density conditions in molecular clouds
indicate a wide variety of densities being present: from dif-
fuse molecular clouds estimated at around 102 cm−3 to dense
molecular clouds which are considered to be between 103 -
106 cm−3.78,79 The critical density obtained here for the vi-
brational decay of CN− interacting with environmental He
atoms was found to be orders of magnitude larger than those
expected in the ISM regions where CN− has been detected,
clearly suggesting that thermal equilibrium for these process
will likely never be attained and that the presently computed
radiative transitions determine that CN− populates essentially
only the ground vibrational level in the ISM.

CONCLUSIONS

2 /He and C−

The cross sections and corresponding rate constants for vi-
brationally inelastic transitions of CN− colliding with He and
Ar atoms have been calculated using new ab initio potential
energy surfaces. As for atom-diatom vibrationally inelastic
collisions, the rate constants for both CN−/He and CN−/Ar
are very small, even smaller than those for corresponding val-
ues of the similar C−
2 /Ar systems. Although more
work is required before deﬁnitive conclusions can be drawn,
it appears from the present calculations that vibrationally in-
elastic collisions of molecular anions with neutral atoms (or
at least noble gas atoms) are similar to neutral molecule-atom
collisions in that they generate similarly small transition prob-
abilities and their collision mechanisms for transferring rel-
ative energy, at sub-thermal and thermal conditions, to the
vibrational internal motion of the anion is rather inefﬁcient.
This is in contrast with the generally more efﬁcient collisional
energy transfer probabilities which are found for molecular
cation-atom systems in the current literature21.

For the anion of interest here this is not a crucial concern
when wanting to ﬁnd alternative paths which are more efﬁ-
cient in cooling its internal vibrational motion, since CN− can
dissipate energy through spontaneous dipole emission (Sec-
tion II). On the other hand, in the case of homonuclear anions
such as C−
2 (of current interest for laser cooling cycles in cold
traps22) where this process is forbidden, collisions are likely
to be the primary means for quenching its vibrational motion.
In such cases high gas pressures and the use of larger noble
buffer gases seem to be required.

The present calculations conﬁrm that collisional energy
transfer paths which involve vibrational degrees of freedom
for a molecular anion under cold trap conditions are invariably
very inefﬁcient and are several orders of magnitude smaller
that the collisional energy-changing paths which involve their
rotational degrees of freedom. One can therefore safely esti-
mate that these two paths to energy losses are markedly decou-
pled with one another and can be treated on a separate footing
within any kinetics modelling of their behaviour.

(Dated: 26 February 2020)

We present an extensive range of quantum calculations for the state-changing rotational dynamics involving two sim-
ple molecular anions which are often included within evolutionary analysis of chemical networks in the Interstellar
environments, C2H−(X 1Σ+) and C2N− (X 3Σ−). The same systems are also of direct interest in modelling selective
photo-detachment (PD) experiments in cold ion traps where the He atoms function as the chief buffer gas at the low
trap temperatures. This study employs accurate, ab initio calculations of the interaction potential energy surfaces (PESs)
for these anions, treated as Rigid Rotors(RR) and the He atom to obtain a wide range of state-changing quantum cross
sections and rates at temperatures up to about 100K.The results are analysed within both physical contexts to show
differences and similarities between the state-changing dynamics of the two systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of carbon chain anions in interstellar and cir-
cumstellar media has triggered and stimulated a large number
of theoretical and experimental studies on these species (e.g.
see reference [1,2]). Their structures and spectral features, as
well as the clariﬁcation of their importance and of their role in
interstellar chemistry, and in gas phase ion-molecule reactions
in general, have therefore also attracted many speciﬁc studies
[3-5] on their behaviour.

The possible, and likely, existence of anions in astrophys-
ical sources was ﬁrst predicted theoretically and considered
in earlier chemical models [6,7], although the ﬁrst negative
hydrocarbon C6H−
6 was only detected in 2006 [8], thereby
also solving the problem of the unidentiﬁed lines discovered
by Kawaguchi et al.
[9]. That identiﬁcation was soon fol-
lowed by the detection of other negatively charged species like
C4H−[10], C8H−[11,12], , C3N−[13], C5N−[4], and CN−
[14]. The majority of these species were ﬁrst detected in
a well observed Circumstellar Envelope (CSE) IRC+10216,
although these and other hydrocarbon anions were also dis-
covered later on in other molecular clouds [15]. As it is to
be expected, the study and search for interstellar anions of
both simple and increasingly more complex structural proper-
ties is still current and relevant. More speciﬁcally, a simple
species like C2H− (X 1Σ−), has been expected to be amenable
to observation with the new astrophysical instruments such as
ALMA, especially since it had been already observed as a sta-
ble molecule in laboratory experiments [16,17]. Furthermore,
its parent neutral form C2H (X 2Σ+) has already been a well-
known astrophysical molecule discovered by observation as
early as 1974 [18], thereby suggesting that the correspond-

a)Electronic mail: francesco.gianturco@uibk.ac.at

ing C2H− anion should also be present, although perhaps as
only a very low-abundancy species, a fact justiﬁed in terms of
its high chemical reactivity and therefore expected rapid de-
struction upon formation. Actual current numerical models
predict, in fact, that the larger carbon chain anion formations
should be in any case more probable than those for similar
smaller chains as the C2H− [19], hence somehow supporting
the difﬁculties for its observation.

In spite of the fact that the actual origin of many of the
hydrocarbon anions has not yet been solved, it is generally ac-
cepted that gas-phase processes are crucial for their formation
and therefore the many observed hydrocarbon radicals CnH
may also be the main precursors of the formation of CnH−
anions through electron attachment or association processes,
whereas associative detachment processes would contribute to
the generation of initial, neutral CnH species. As an example,
a new mechanism for the formation of C2H− from C2H2 has
been proposed not long ago [1] from laboratory experiments.
Along similar lines, another small C-bearing molecule, the
neutral CCN radical (X 2Πr) has been also detected earlier
on in the interstellar medium [20], where the molecule was
observed at the 1 – 2 mK level toward the same circum-
stellar envelope (CSE) of IRC + 10216 already mentioned
earlier, using the facilities of the Arizona Radio Observa-
tory (ARO). Lambda doublets of the J = 4.5 → 3.5 and the
J = 6.5 → 5.5 transitions at 106 GHz and 154 GHz in the
Ω = 1/2 ladder were measured with the ARO 12 m tele-
scope, as well as the J = 9.5 → 8.5 lines near 225 GHz, using
the ARO Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT) [20]. Consider-
ing other species in the same environment, it is interesting to
note that the [CN]/[CCN]/[C3N] abundance ratio was found
to be ∼ 500 : 1 : 50, thus indicating again one could expect
a rather low abundance for the neutral radical CCN. For the
corresponding anionic counterpart, however, no observational
evidence within the same CSE has been reported thus far, also
suggesting a low abundance of the latter once formed within

that chemical network.

II. FEATURES OF THE AB INITIO INTERACTIONS OF
THE PRESENT ANIONS WITH HE ATOMS

In spite of this absence of direct detection, both the above
anionic molecules, CCN− and CCH−, have been the object
of several laboratory studies which have analysed in some de-
tail the photo-detachment (PD) mechanisms of these species
and several other structural properties [21-26]. Furthermore,
in general terms we should note here that possible astrophysi-
cal abundances of either observed or not yet observed species
have to be understood in terms of molecular stabilities, reac-
tion probabilities and of both radiative and collisional excita-
tions and relaxation of internal molecular modes: the accu-
rate knowledge of all these facts can indeed help us to better
explain the existence of a molecule and the probability of it
being observed. The molecular stability and the spectroscopic
properties of both the C2H− and C2N− anions been studied in
various earlier investigations [22,23,26], while the modelling
of molecular emission in the ISM environments where they
could be expected to exist requires collisional rate coefﬁcients
with the most abundant interstellar species like He and H2.
Collisional data have been already presented for the C2H−
anion interacting with He [27], while no corresponding cal-
culations, as far as we know, exist for the collisional rotation-
state changes of C2N− interacting with He. The actual ab
initio PES is also not known for that system. The quantum
dynamics of both these anions, besides not being extensively
studied under CSE conditions, has also been only partially dis-
cussed under the operating low temperatures of ion cold traps
[28]. The present work is therefore directed to acquiring novel
knowledge about the quantum dynamics of C2N− in collision
with He under both astrochemical and cold ion trap condi-
tions, further implementing a comparison between its dynam-
ical behaviour and that of the C2H− polar anion under similar
conditions.

The following Section will only brieﬂy remind readers
about the features of the anisotropic potential energy surface
involving C2H− and He atoms, since it has been presented and
analysed already in earlier work [27]. It will instead present
in greater details the new calculations of the ab initio points
related to the Rigid Rotor (RR) PES associated to the interac-
tion between C2N− (X 3Σ−) and the neutral He atom. The two
interaction potentials will then be compared and their level of
spatial anisotropy will be analysed and discussed.

The next Section 3 will present the state-changing rotation-
ally inelastic cross sections for both systems and discuss the
effects from spin-spin and spin-rotation structural effects on
the C2N− system via à vis the C2H− (X 1Σ+) system. The cor-
responding inelastic rates at the temperatures of interest will
also be presented, compared and discussed. The following
Section 4 shall examine the possible evolutionary dynamics
of C2N− anions under the conditions of a cold trap when they
are undergoing laser photo-detachment processes. A compar-
ison with the corresponding behaviour of the C2H− system
will also be presented and discussed. Our present conclusions
will be given in Section 5.

As mentioned in the previous Section, the electronic ground
state of C2N− was taken to be (X 3Σ−) as indicated to be in ear-
lier work [22]. The molecular geometry of this linear anion is
with rCC = 1.344 Å and 1.207 Å and was given in the exper-
iments from Garand et al.
in ref. [22]. We have optimized
the molecular geometry using the MRCI + Davidson correc-
tion [29] and employing the aug-cc-pVQZ basis set. The ﬁnal
values of the same bond distances have been the following:
rCC = 1.360 Å and rCN = 1.212 Å . The ab initio calculations
of the 2D grid of points in the space (R, theta) were carried out
with the program package MOLPRO 2012 of ref. [29]. For
all the present calculations we have employed the internally-
contracted multi-reference conﬁguration interaction method
(IC-MRCI) [30,31], using the aug-cc-pVQZ basis set [32] on
all atoms. The reference space for the MRCI calculations con-
sists of a complete - active space by distributing 14 electrons
in 15 orbitals. All single and double excitations from the ref-
erence conﬁgurations are included in the variational calcula-
tion. The effect of quadruple excitations is estimated via the
Davidson correction [29]. The angular grid involved calcu-
lations of radial ` cut ` every 5°, from 0°to 180°. The radial
grid included a higher density of points around the various
minima regions at each selected angle. The total number of
radial points was: 44. The global minimum for the complex
was found at a distance of around 6.7 Bohr from the centre-of-
mass, located at an angle of around 80°, with a well´ s depth
of around 58 cm−1. The data shown by the two panels of
Figure 1 provide a pictorial view of the new PES calculated
for the C2N−/He system (upper panel), while it also shows
for comparison the PES already calculated in earlier work for
− interacting with He (from ref. [27]).
the similar anion of C2
One clearly sees from the two panels the expected similarities
between the two interaction potentials since both exhibit the
presence of the minimum structure of their complex with He
to be slightly off the C2v geometry and at similar values of dis-
tances from the c.-of-m. in each complex. Furthermore, given
the larger number of electrons in the C2N− case, the corre-
sponding well appears to be deeper than that for the C2H−/He
complex [27]. Both potentials will be asymptotically driven
by the polarizability term involving the spherical, dipole po-
larizability of the He partner and therefore will behave very
similarly in their long-range regions because of it. The lo-
calization of the excess charge provided by the extra bound
electron of the anion is also an interesting item for the new
CCN−/He PES discussed here. The Mulliken charges in the
asymptotic situation (e.g. with the helium at a distance of 50
bohr from the c.-o.-m. of the anionic target) turn out to be
as follows (when computed with the MRCI // aug-cc-pVQZ
of the post-HF treatment): C1 = -0.59049; C2 = +0.22532 ;
N1 = -0.63483. Here C2 is the Carbon atom in the middle
of the molecule, so that the geometry of CCN- is given as:
C1-C2-N1 , with no extra charge on the interacting He atom,
as expected. The direction and value of the dipole moment
are therefore given as: 2.1818 Debye, placed along the posi-
tive direction of the molecular z-axis from the C1-end of the

for both systems could be done by numerically generating the
radial coefﬁcients of the multipolar expansion of the Rigid

where re is the geometry of the equilibrium structure of the an-
ion, already discussed earlier, and the sum over the contribut-
ing lambda values went up to 19, although only the dominant,
stronger terms are shown in Figure 2. The panels of that ﬁgure
also compare the present ﬁndings for C2N− with the earlier
data for C2H− from ref. [27].

The radial coefﬁcients presented in that ﬁgure underline
once more the similarities between the two systems, for which
the overall spatial anisotropy is chieﬂy controlled by lambda
= 1, 2 and 3 terms. This indicates that the ∆N = 1 transitions
between rotational levels will be those for which the acting
torque from the anisotropic PES will be the strongest, fol-
lowed by the ∆N = 2 transitions. Such provisional features
will be further discussed when analysing the computed inelas-
tic cross sections and rates. Another important element of dis-
tinction / similarity would be the relative spacings in energy
between rotational states for both systems. The results from
the present calculations are reported by the data of Figure 3.

To simplify the comparison we report only the energy spac-
ing between N-level separations, without showing the spin-

consultation.

In the OH+ (3Σ−) state, we have three levels for each total
angular momentum ≥ 1: the rotational levels are in fact split
by spin-spin and spin-rotation coupling effects. In the pure
Hund’s case (b) the electronic spin momentum S couples with
the nuclear rotational angular momentum N (N = R for a Σ
state) to form the total angular momentum j, given by j =
N + S [36,37]. As a consequence of that coupling terms, the
rotational levels of the molecule may be labelled not only by
the above quantum numbers deﬁned in the Hund’s case (b)
but also by their parity index ε. The levels in molecules of
odd multiplicity with parity index equal to +1 are labelled e,
and those with parity index equal to -1 are labelled f [36].
However, we shall omit this index in the following discussion
since we shall not be using it in our analysis.

The extensive work we have done on collision of He with
a 3Σ− molecule [36,37] have already shown that the ∆N 6=
0 transitions involve much larger energy values than those
which cause changes in the spin quantum number S that is
responsible for the separations between j states. Thus, one
can say that rotational quenching transitions have much larger
energy gaps than those which simply cause spin-ﬂipping pro-
cesses within each N-labelled manifold.
In a full close-
coupling (CC) approach to the quantum dynamics the molec-
ular Hamiltonian includes, in addition to the rotational con-
tribution, a nuclear coupling contribution which induces hy-
perﬁne energy splitting. These splittings are however lower
than typically 10−3 cm−1, i.e. they are much lower than the
rotational spacing and collisional energies investigated in this
work, as we shall further show later in this paper. In such sit-
uation, the common approach (e.g. see: Alexander & Dagdi-
gian [38]) is to neglect the hyperﬁne splitting and to decouple
the spin wave functions from the rotational wave functions,
using a recoupling scheme. This simpliﬁes considerably the
dynamic problem which is then reduced to solving the usual
spin-less CC equations associated to the more usual 1Σ case.
This approximate but almost exact ` recoupling approach `
will be considered as our reference approach in the following
calculations, where our results will be compared with those
carried out for the exact 1Σ case of the C2H− molecular an-
ion.

Scattering calculations were carried out for collision en-
ergies between 1 and 1000 cm−1 using steps of 0.1 cm for
energies up to 100 cm−1, of 0.2 cm−1 for 100-200 cm−1,
of 1.0 cm−1 for 200-500 cm−1 and of 2 cm−1 for 500-1000
cm−1. This ﬁne energy grid was used to ensure that impor-
tant features such as the many resonances appearing in the
cross sections were accurately accounted for and their contri-
butions correctly included when the corresponding rates were
calculated, as discussed below. The number of partial waves
was increased with increasing energy reaching J = 100 for
the highest energies considered. Inelastic cross sections were
computed for all transitions between j = 0 to j = 12, which
was deemed to be sufﬁcient to model buffer gas dynamics in a
cold trap up to about 50 K (see below), while the same range
of levels is expected to be the one most signiﬁcantly popu-
lated during low-energy collisional exchanges with He atoms
within ISM environments dynamical conditions.

spin and spin-rotation splitting for C2N−. The sizes of those
splitting constants are not known or available as yet and we
will be discussing further in the next Section how they will be
included in the present study. Their energy splittings would
in any event not be visible on the chosen energy scale in that
Figure. We clearly see, however, that the density of states over
the examined range of about 60 cm−1, which should cover the
relevant energy ranges of both the CSE environments and the
cold ion traps preparation, is dramatically different between
the two systems, with the C2N− anion showing a double num-
ber of states being accessible within that energy range.

The higher ` crowding ` of rotational states per unit en-
ergy for the latter molecule translates into a higher number
of them being signiﬁcantly populated at equilibrium tempera-
tures in either environments. The comparison between steady-
state rotational level populations in the two anions is reported
by the two panels in Figure 4, where we clearly see that at
temperatures in a cold trap around 25K the anion in the left
panel signiﬁcantly populates levels up to N = 10, while the
C2H− anion on the right panel only has states up to N = 6
signiﬁcantly populated. Such differences of behaviour will be
further discussed in the next two Sections when the inelas-
tic cross sections and rates will be discussed and the possible
dynamics of laser-induced PD processes in traps will be anal-
ysed.

III. QUANTUM CALCULATIONS OF STATE-CHANGING
ROTATIONALLY INELASTIC CROSS SECTIONS AND
RATES

The inelastic cross sections involving collisional transitions
in both the title molecules were calculated using our in-house
multichannel quantum scattering code ASPIN, which we have
already described in many earlier publications of our group
[33-35] and therefore will not be repeated here in detail. The
interested readers are referred to the above publications for

Another quantity that we shall compute from the cross sec-
tions is the state-to-state inelastic rotational rates over a range
of temperatures from thresholds up to about 100K, to cover
the range of T values expected to be signiﬁcant for processes
in the ISM environments we are discussing here. Hence, once
the state-to-state inelastic integral cross sections are known,
the rotationally inelastic rate constants k j→ j′(T ) can be evalu-
ated as the convolution of the cross sections over a Boltzmann
distribution of the relative collision energies. In the equation
below, all quantities are given in atomic units:

Both the calculations of inelastic cross sections and of their
corresponding rates over the range of temperatures mentioned
earlier have been carried out using the new interaction PES
for the C2N−/He system and via the earlier PES already com-
puted for the C2H−/He system [27]. The comparison between
our ﬁndings for these two systems will be further carried out
in this Section by presenting our computed data below.

IV. QUANTUM DYNAMICS OF LASER
PHOTODETACHMENT PROCESSES IN COLD TRAPS

The additional process that can take place in cold ion traps
[27, 39] where the present anions can be conﬁned, and which
we now want to describe speciﬁcally for the title molecules
of this study, involves the following dynamical steps: (i) col-
lisional population re-distribution among the rotational lev-
els of the anion by interaction with He atoms, as the preva-
lent buffer gas, at the trap temperature; (ii) switching on the
photo-detaching laser after the previous rotational population
equilibration has been achieved. One could then be vary-
ing its operational wavelength to selectively depopulate dif-
ferent rotational states of the anion present in the trap after
the step (i); (iii) further test other operating conditions such
as: buffer gas density, trap equilibration temperature, laser
power and laser wavelength in order to ﬁnd the best choices
for the state-selective photo-detachment (PD) processes tai-
lored to the present system. We therefore have to know be-
forehand the state-changing collisional rates for the molecular
anion in the trap at different operating temperatures and the ki-
netics of the evolution of the rotational state populations dur-
ing collisional equilibration. We further require selecting the
values of the PD rates (obtained from the PD cross sections as
functions of the initial rotational state, as already discussed by
us in [28,39]. As a comment about the calculated cross sec-
tions and rate for state-to-state inelastic processes sufﬁces it
to say that the dominant inelastic processes we found for the
present systems are those for which the state-changing val-
ues of ∆N ± 1, 2 and for which the rates at a temperature of,
say 20 K, are of the order of xxxxx in units of cm3 s−11. As
a comparison, the corresponding Einstein spontaneous emis-
sion coefﬁcients for the C2H− anion vary to be from about
10−3 to 10−5 smaller than the collisional rates for this system
[28] .

In order to be modelling the rotational population evolution
dynamics, the master equations need to be solved using the
collisional thermal rates computed above at each chosen trap
temperature and for the range of selected He density:

dni(t)
dt

= ∑
j6=i

n j(t)C ji(T ) − ni(t) ∑
i6= j

Pi j(T )

(3)

The quantities Pi j(T ) are the rates for the destruction of level
i, while its formation rates are given by the C ji(T ) terms.
During the collisional step, i.e. before the laser is switched
on, the coefﬁcients are given as: Pi j(T ) = ηHek j→ j′(T ) and
C ji(T ) = ηHek j→ j′ (T ). These relationships describes the `
collision-driven ` time evolution process of thermalisation of
the relative populations of the rotational levels of the anion
which are populated at the selected buffer gas temperature
and for a given density ηHe in the trap. Once thermalisation is
reached and the PD laser is turned on, one needs to modify the
above master equations by including the PD rates discussed in
the previous section and linked to the PD cross sections:

dni(t)
dt

= ∑
j6=i

n j(t)C ji(T ) − ni(t)

Pi j(T ) + KPD

i

∑
i6= j

,

where KPD
is the additional destruction rate of the selected
level i caused by the PD laser. The set of rates KPD
is criti-
cal in the experiments in general and for the present numerical
simulations because they drive the destruction of both the pop-
ulation of one speciﬁc rotational level i and of all the molecu-
lar ions which have been populating that speciﬁc state during
the previous thermalisation step in the traps. In the experi-
ments of this study these rates depend on the laser photon ﬂux
and on the overlap between the laser beam and the ion cloud
within the trap. Since these parameters, as well as the absolute
values of the state-to-state PD cross sections, are presently
unknown for the title molecular anions, we shall introduce a
scaling parameter which we have already discussed in our ear-
lier work [28,40] according to which the relation between the
required rate and the estimated cross section is given by:

J′′ = α(ν)σPD
KPD

J′′ (ν)

(5)

The above scaling parameter is helping us to include in the
modelling the relative role of different features of the photo-
detachment experiment which are effectively the laser-driven
features of the PD dynamics. They include quantities like
laser-ﬂux, spatial overlap, etc. which compete with the pure
collisional rates that repopulate the anion’s rotational levels
via its interaction with the buffer gas. This speciﬁc aspect
of the modelling allows us to simulate either a ` collision-
dominated ` situation or a ` PD-dominated ` situation when-
ever the laser strength is markedly varied, as we will be further
discussing below. The values of the σPD
J′′ (ν) can be obtained
through an analysis which we have presented before [28,40]
and which will be not repeating here. Brieﬂy, the PD cross
section is given as:

σPD

J′′ (ν) ∝

Here Θ(E − Eth) is a step function so that only transitions with
Eth < E are considered, and the Clebsch-Gordan coefﬁcient
enforces the selection rule ∆J′′ = ±1 for the speciﬁc PD pro-
cess under consideration. Since the rotational levels’ relative
populations initially also sum to one, they have limited effect
on the relative sizes of the PD cross sections and the PD curve
identiﬁed by the above equation. Hence, the most important
factors are the selected value for the p exponential parameter
and the actual wavelength ν of the laser source with respect to
the threshold of the speciﬁc electron-detachment process.
