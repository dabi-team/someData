ABSTRACT
Accurate forecasting of space weather requires knowledge of the source regions where solar energetic particles (SEP) and eruptive
events originate. Recent work has linked several major SEP events in 2014, January, to speciﬁc features in the host active region
(AR 11944). In particular, plasma composition measurements in and around the footpoints of hot, coronal loops in the core of
the active region were able to explain the values later measured in-situ by the Wind spacecraft. Due to important diﬀerences in
elemental composition between SEPs and the solar wind, the magnitude of the Si/S elemental abundance ratio emerged as a key
diagnostic of SEP seed population and solar wind source locations. We seek to understand if the results are typical of other active
regions, even if they are not solar wind sources or SEP productive. In this paper, we use a novel composition analysis technique,
together with an evolutionary magnetic ﬁeld model, in a new approach to investigate a typical solar active region (AR 11150),
and identify the locations of highly fractionated (high Si/S abundance ratio) plasma. Material conﬁned near the footpoints of
coronal loops, as in AR 11944, that in this case have expanded to the AR periphery, show the signature, and can be released from
magnetic ﬁeld opened by reconnection at the AR boundary. Since the fundamental characteristics of closed ﬁeld loops being
opened at the AR boundary is typical of active regions, this process is likely to be general.

1 INTRODUCTION

Plasma elemental composition is an important tracer of matter and
particulate ﬂow through the solar atmosphere and into the helio-
sphere. Relative elemental abundances show distinct patterns in the
corona, SEPs, and the solar wind that can be used to understand
their formation processes (Meyer 1985). The fast (>700 km s−1)
solar wind has the same composition as the solar photosphere, but
elements with a low (<10 eV) ﬁrst ionisation potential (FIP), such
as Fe, Ca, and Si, are enhanced in the corona and slow (∼500 km
s−1) solar wind by factors of 2-4 compared to high FIP elements
such as C, N, and O (von Steiger et al. 2000). This is known as the
FIP eﬀect and the mechanism that preferentially transports low-FIP
elements into the corona appears to operate in the chromosphere and
fractionates ions from neutrals (Laming 2015).

Since SEPs and the slow solar wind have a similar composition
they could, in principle, emanate from the same coronal plasma
source. There are two key diﬀerences, however, that suggest that
SEPs originate from a separate source of pre-existing coronal ma-
terial than the slow solar wind: the in-situ (SEP or solar wind) to
photospheric abundance ratio dependence on FIP is not the same,
and the magnitude of the abundance enhancement factor (commonly
called the FIP-bias) is diﬀerent for some of the same element pairs
(Reames 2018).

The ratio of SEP to photospheric abundance transitions from

greater than one for low-FIP elements to less than one for high-
FIP elements around 10 eV, whereas the transition is a few eV higher
for the slow solar wind to photospheric abundance ratio (see Figure
14 of Reames 2018). This means that elements close to this tran-
sition such as S (FIP = 10.36 eV) could behave diﬀerently in the
two cases, providing a useful diagnostic that other elements do not.
Some previous studies have argued that an abundance ratio such as
Si/S shows an enhancement in SEPs, because S is behaving like a true
high-FIP element, but shows no enhancement in the slow solar wind,
where S behaves like a low-FIP element (Reames 2018). The com-
plete observational and theoretical picture, however, is even more
complex and contradictory. The Si/S ratio does in fact often show an
enhancement in the slow solar wind; albeit a little lower than detected
in other element pairs. Models of the FIP eﬀect based on the forces
arising from the reﬂection and refraction of magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) waves (Laming 2004, 2015) show no Si/S fractionation in
the slow solar wind, and a lower FIP bias than measured in SEPs. It
is diﬃcult also to reconcile these models and in-situ measurements
with results from remote spectroscopic observations. The FIP bias in
diﬀerent coronal structures varies considerably (Feldman 1992), can
be larger than measured in-situ, and may also depend on the under-
lying technique. A recent study showed how the contributions from
diﬀerent components of the slow solar wind can potentially reconcile
the remote and in-situ measurements (Brooks et al. 2020), but more
extensive investigations are needed.

Distilling all this confusing information down to something useful,
one simple diagnostic stands out. As pointed out previously (Mewaldt
et al. 2002) and supported by recent studies (Reames 2018; Brooks &

Figure 1. AIA images of AR 11150 observed on 2011, February 1. The background greyscale image shows the location of the active region in the Southern
hemisphere. The overlaid box shows the cutout region for the images in the bottom row. From left to right we show the longitudinal magnetic ﬂux, 171Å, 193Å,
211Å, and 94Å images. The images are formed at temperatures in the range of 0.9—-7.1 MK.

Yardley 2021; Harra et al. 2021), the highest event averaged FIP-bias
is seen in SEPs. More precisely, the Si/S FIP bias measured in SEPs
is a factor of 1.3–2.5 higher than in the slow solar wind, where values
above 2 are rarely seen in-situ for this element pair. This makes the
magnitude of the FIP bias derived from Si/S lines a good diagnostic
for searching for the sources of SEPs and the slow solar wind.

The EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS, Culhane et al. 2007) on
Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007) observes the Si X 258.375Å and S X
264.223Å spectral lines formed in the solar corona. In combination
with spectral lines from Fe ions covering a wide range of temper-
atures, (Brooks et al. 2015) used the Si X 258.375/S X 264.223
ratio to make a map of potential slow wind sources across the entire
solar disk. Following the argument that the transition from low- to
high-FIP elements is higher than 10 eV in the slow wind, it was sug-
gested that this map localises the sources of SEPs to active regions
(Reames 2018). A steep transition between low- and high-FIP ele-
ments has been found in AR spectra before (Lanzafame et al. 2002)
but a connection with SEPs was not noted, so this is a very recent
idea.

Some SEPs have been linked speciﬁcally to ﬂares (Kahler et al.
2001) and reconnection jets in sunspots (Nitta et al. 2006; Wang
et al. 2006; Bučík et al. 2018, and references therein). There may
also be variations that exist in the enhancement of heavy ion ele-
ments, which are potentially related to acceleration associated with
magnetic reconnection during solar ﬂares or jets. Mason et al. (2016),
for example, found a huge enhancement in Sulphur in 16 impulsive,
3He-rich SEP events. This unusual abundance signature suggests that
the accelerated plasma has been heated to generate the Q/M (charge-
to-mass) ratio for the C-Fe ions. Therefore, obtaining the plasma
characteristics such as the temperature of the associated solar ﬂare,
can help to constrain elemental abundance measurements (Bučík
et al. 2021). While most of the variations are systematic power laws
in Q/M that are dependent upon temperature, there is also a varia-

MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2021)

tion that comes from the source itself. Recently, Reames (2020) has
identiﬁed four distinct seed populations of SEPs however, when con-
sidering gradual SEPs it is likely that these events may also contain
a component of reaccelerated ions from impulsive events or remnant
suprathermal ions from previous gradual events.

In fact, only a very recent study has used EIS composition mea-
surements to identify SEP sources (Brooks & Yardley 2021; Brooks
et al. 2021). Brooks & Yardley (2021) used Si/S abundance ratios
measured by the Wind spacecraft to trace the likely sources of several
signiﬁcant SEP events back to EIS Si/S composition maps of the host
active region. They found that the Si/S abundance ratios measured in
and around the footpoints of the hot, core loops of AR 11944 could
explain the measurements made by Wind. The highest FIP bias was
found closest to the region where the FIP eﬀect operates (the top
of the chromosphere) and where the plasma was conﬁned by strong
magnetic ﬁeld on the order of hundreds of Gauss. The surrounding
regions had a lower FIP bias, but more direct access to open ﬁeld and
areas of outﬂow, suggesting that the plasma could also form part of
the solar wind.

Similar studies are diﬃcult to perform systematically because they
rely on multiple missions. EIS composition measurements have been
linked to Si/S data from the ACE observatory in the past (Brooks &
Warren 2011), but a hardware anomaly on ACE occurred in 2011,
August, and S data are no longer available. Due to its low abundance,
S data are not routinely available from Wind either, and so we rely
on large SEP events that are likely only to occur in the active phase
of the solar cycle (Desai et al. 2016).

Nevertheless, these studies have raised questions as to whether the
results are typical of ARs in general, and what the typical escape
mechanisms are for SEP and solar wind source plasma. We should
also recognise the complexity of this challenge in times of high
activity when multiple active regions are on disk. In the Brooks
& Yardley (2021) study, one of the events was linked with a C2.6

BLOS171Å193Å211Å94Åﬂare that preceeded a strong rise in the Si/S abundance ratio, but
a few hours earlier a limb ﬂare was associated with a CME from
a diﬀerent region. We know that AR 11944 was producing plasma
with the correct SEP Si/S composition signature, and if this material
is generally present around the region (even if not escaping on open
magnetic ﬁeld), then in principle it can be accelerated by the arrival
of a distant CME-shock; so that the host AR becomes a passive
source.

This suggests other diagnostic methods we might develop to in-
vestigate further. Our strategy here is to use a novel EIS analysis
technique that searches for higher than usual FIP bias, to see whether
and where highly fractionated plasma is produced in a typical AR;
regardless of whether it is SEP productive or a solar wind source.
We then examine the associated magnetic ﬁeld inferred from an evo-
lutionary magnetic ﬁeld model. EIS spectral lines often show high
speed blue wing asymmetries (Hara et al. 2008). These are basi-
cally present in the upﬂows at the edges of all sizes of active regions
(Yardley et al. 2021b), implying an availability of plasma with the
composition found in the blue wing asymmetry. Our key insight is
to recognize that the FIP bias in the asymmetric component will
be higher if the asymmetry is larger in Si X 258.375Å than in S X
264.223Å. This is in fact what we have found in the past (Brooks
& Warren 2012). Therefore, it is important to look at the FIP bias
as a function of velocity, since locations of higher FIP bias may be
missed if the analysis is restricted to the dominant components of
the spectral lines. We discuss the details of the technique, Doppler
velocity calibration, and magnetic ﬁeld modelling in Sect. 2.

In this work we present observations of AR 11150, which crossed
the solar disk from 27 January to 10 February, 2011. In Fig. 1 we
show a line-of-sight magnetogram and EUV images of the region
from HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, Schou et al. 2012)
and SDO/AIA (Pesnell et al. 2012; Lemen et al. 2012, Solar Dy-
namics Observaotry/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly,). The region
is magnetically simple (𝛽-class) with leading positive polarity and
trailing negative polarity sunspots connected by an arcade of coronal
loops. Loops also connect to further trailing positive/negative polar-
ities with no sunspots. Our aim is to identify the locations of highly
fractionated plasma and investigate how such plasma might escape
into the heliosphere, or become a reservoir that could be shock ac-
celerated, should a CME or ﬂare occur. We stress that according to
the GOES proton ﬂux data there are no major SEP events associ-
ated with this AR during the time-period of our observations, but we
emphasize that typical AR conditions are important, since an SEP
non-productive region can still become a passive source. As we ap-
proach the maximum of the new solar cycle, further investigation of
the sources of signiﬁcant SEP events will be a focus of the Parker
Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter missions, so another goal of this work
is to test and demonstrate new analysis techniques that will support
that eﬀort.

2 DATA AND METHODS

2.1 Processing details for the presented data

We downloaded solar images from the SDO/AIA online cut-out ser-
vice that accesses the Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) at
Stanford at http://jsoc.stanford.edu/. These images were processed
and calibrated to level 1 using standard procedures (Boerner et al.
2012).

The magnetograms that are taken by HMI (Schou et al. 2012; Cou-
vidat et al. 2016) contain the line-of-sight component of the magnetic

ﬁeld and are downloaded from the JSOC website at Stanford. These
magnetograms were processed and calibrated to level 1 using stan-
dard procedures although, additional pre-processing (see Gibb et al.
2014; Yardley et al. 2018b) is required before the magnetograms can
be used as the lower boundary condition in the simulations of the
coronal magnetic ﬁeld. These procedures include time-averaging,
the removal of low magnetic ﬂux values and small-scale magnetic
features, and ﬂux balancing. The application of these clean-up pro-
cedures ensures that we focus on modelling the large-scale magnetic
ﬁeld evolution of the AR.

To account for line-of-sight eﬀects we applied a cosine correction
to the full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms to estimate the radial
component of the magnetic ﬁeld (Yardley et al. 2018b). We then
adjust for projection eﬀects by using a SunPy routine (SunPy Project
et al. 2020) to diﬀerentially rotate the radialised magnetograms to
the time of the AR’s central meridian passage. Further speciﬁc pro-
cessing of the magnetograms for our modelling is described below.
We used the Hinode/EIS for the Doppler velocity and plasma ele-
mental composition analysis. EIS has a spectral resolution of 22mÅ
and records EUV spectra in two short-wavelength (171—212Å) and
long-wavelength (245-—291Å) bands. Typically, some sub-set of
these wavelength ranges containing speciﬁc spectral lines of inter-
est is telemetered to ground. In this paper we use an EIS observing
sequence that scans a ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of 240(cid:48)(cid:48) x 512(cid:48)(cid:48) using
the 1(cid:48)(cid:48) slit in coarse 2(cid:48)(cid:48) steps. A 60s exposure is taken at each slit
position, and about 40% of the full spectral readout is downloaded.
So a large number of diagnostic spectral lines from Fe VIII—-Fe
XXIV, Ca XIV—-XVII, Si VII—-X, S X—-XIII, and Mg V—-VII
are included in the observations.

A number of instrumental eﬀects need dealt with before these data
are suitable for analysis. We reduced the datasets using the stan-
dard calibration software (eis_prep), which takes account of pixels
aﬀected by cosmic ray strikes, dust, and electrical charge.

To coalign the EIS scans with the AIA images we used the instru-
ments’ solar coordinate information to determine the approximate
common FOV, then adjusted it based on image registration of bright
points observed in both the AIA 193Å and EIS Fe XIII 202.044Å
images. We then re-sampled the EIS FOV to the AIA plate scale
and coaligned the data using cross-correlation. As a ﬁnal step, we
used EIS contour overlays on the original EIS data as a reference
to visually adjust the EIS contour overlays on the AIA data. This
helped to compensate for the fact that the EIS images are a construct
of exposures taken over a 2 hour period whereas the AIA images are
exposures of a few seconds.

2.2 Relative Doppler Velocities

Instrumental eﬀects also aﬀect the determination of Doppler veloc-
ities with EIS. Due to variations in the thermal conditions of the
instrument as Hinode orbits the earth, there is a drift of the spec-
trum back and forth across the CCDs. Furthermore, the slit is not
exactly aligned with the CCD axis, and also shows a small curvature.
We applied an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) model (Kamio et al.
2010) to correct these eﬀects. The ANN reproduces the orbital ther-
mal drift by using temperature information from sensors positioned
around EIS. Strong emission lines are used to accurately establish
the slit tilt and curvature. After correction, the uncertainty in velocity
measurements is 4.5 km s−1.

Since EIS lacks an absolute wavelength calibration, in this work we
use Doppler velocities measured relative to a reference wavelength
deﬁned by averaging the top 50 pixels of the EIS slit across the FOV.
Ideally this would be representative of quiet Sun where Doppler

These upﬂows show high speed asymmetric components in the blue (short
wavelength) wing of the line proﬁles. The red dots show the results for the
total emission from these proﬁles, and the blue dots show the results for
the asymmetric component only. The magenta line shows the best-ﬁt linear

motions are expected to average close to zero, but in reality our
observations were taken close to an active region so this is unlikely
to be the case. The absolute Doppler velocities, however, are not
an essential component of this work. We use the Si VII 275.368Å
spectral line as wavelength standard. This is one of the strongest
unblended lines in the LW spectral range where the main composition
diagnostic lines we use fall.

the same upﬂow regions as shown in Fig. S2. We used the linear relationship
from Fig. S2 to convert the ratio to FIP bias and plot the appropriate range on
the right hand axis.

2.3 Plasma composition measurements

The Si X 258.375Å and S X 264.223Å spectral lines are close in
wavelength and formed at similar temperatures. The ratio of the two
lines is therefore, in principle, a good diagnostic of the ratio of the
Si and S abundance. This ratio gives a measure of the degree of
fractionation of the plasma due to the FIP eﬀect (FIP bias), though
rather than being representative of the composition of all low FIP
elements, in this case it properly refers to the degree of fractionation
of Si compared to S. The contribution functions of the two lines also
have similar temperature and density dependencies, but ideally we
would derive the temperature and density structure of the observed
plasma from a range of emission lines and convolve it with the
contribution functions to model the ratio as accurately as possible.
This is a standard analysis technique and we have used it in several
previous studies of a variety of coronal features (Brooks & Warren
2011; Baker et al. 2015; Brooks et al. 2015).

This method is not practical for this work. It involves integrating
the intensities in wavelength across the line proﬁles, whereas we
are interested in how the Si/S abundance ratio varies with velocity.
EIS line proﬁles also often show asymmetries (Hara et al. 2008; De
Pontieu et al. 2009) indicative of upﬂows at the active region edges.
Such upﬂows are a well known feature of many ARs and are often
the locations where line proﬁle asymmetries are most conspicuous.
They appear across at least an order of magnitude in total magnetic
ﬂux (Yardley et al. 2021b), and may contribute to the slow solar wind
(Sakao et al. 2007; Del Zanna 2008; Harra et al. 2008; Doschek et al.
2008). In the past we have attempted to measure the plasma compo-
sition in the high-speed blue-shifted asymmetric component of the
line proﬁles in AR upﬂows by ﬁtting asymmetric and multiple Gaus-
sian functions (Brooks & Warren 2012). Two components to the line
proﬁles may be a good approximation (Tian et al. 2011). The real-
ity is, however, that the emission varies smoothly with wavelength,
and it is not at all clear that single or multiple Gaussian ﬁts, which
necessarily have assigned velocities, will capture the variation in FIP
bias over the full range of velocities apparent in the line proﬁles. Fur-
thermore, the magnitude and centroid of the asymmetric component

ﬁnd a solution that works for all spectral lines simultaneously.

Nevertheless, our earlier work (Brooks & Warren 2012) motivated
this analysis, because it appears that the highest FIP bias is often
detected in the asymmetric component. Fig. 2 shows the relationship
between the FIP bias, derived using a full computation of the density
and temperature structure, and the Si/S intensity ratio for a sample of
15 areas in the upﬂows associated with an AR observed in December,
2007. Details of the observations and analysis method are given
in the original paper (Brooks & Warren 2012). Note the almost
linear relationship between the two quantities. This gives a convenient
approximate method of converting between them.

To illustrate why the FIP bias is sometimes larger in the asymmetric
component we show a comparison between two synthetic line proﬁles
in Fig. 3. The Gaussian function has a peak intensity of 1, a ﬂat
background intensity of 0.1, a full width at half maximum of 100
km s−1, and is centred on zero velocity. The asymmetric function
is formed by combining the blue and red wings of two Gaussians
with diﬀerent widths. The ﬁrst matches the red wing of the Gaussian
function, and the second has an increased width on the blue wing.
The asymmetry is 20%, which means that the diﬀerence between
the widths of the Gaussian functions that ﬁt the blue and red wings
is 20% of the total width. For further details see Brooks & Warren
(2012) – especially equation 1.

We show the ratio of the two proﬁles in the lower panel of Fig.
3. As a result of the asymmetry, the intensity ratio in the blue wing
shows a Gaussian distribution. In this perfect case, the intensity ratio
ﬁrst increases as the velocity increases, reaching a peak around 105
km s−1, before decreasing again. Note that at all times the intensity
ratio is larger than 1.

The model shows why the FIP bias is sometimes larger in the
asymmetric component of the upﬂows. It is because in these cases
the asymmetry is stronger in the Si X 258.375Å line than in the
S X 264.223Å line (see, for example, Fig. 2 in Brooks & Warren
2012) so the intensity ratio is larger in the blue wing. In order to have
photospheric abundances (FIP bias close to 1), the S X 264.223Å line
needs to be relatively strong. This suggests that looking in the high
velocity wings of the line proﬁles could be a good strategy for trying
to detect high levels of FIP bias, since in some cases the asymmetry
diminishes faster at longer wavelengths (larger velocities) in S X
264.223Å. The model of Fig. 3 also shows that the peak FIP bias
will be associated with a speciﬁc velocity even if the asymmetry is
a continuous function of velocity. This is an encouraging result for
previous work that used multiple Gaussian ﬁts. Note also that since
the Si X 258.375Å and S X 264.223Å lines both show asymmetries in
the blue wing, that disappear in the noise of the background spectrum
at high velocities, the ratios in the real data are unlikely to match the
idealised model case.

We show real examples in Fig. 4 using the same sample of AR
upﬂows as Fig. 2. To calibrate velocities as a function of wavelength
for the Si X 258.375Å/S X 264.223Å ratio, we interpolated the line
proﬁles to a higher resolution velocity grid (2 km s−1) and deﬁned
the peaks of the new proﬁles to be zero velocity before taking the
ratio of the two. We then used the linear relationship found from
Fig. 2 to convert the Si/S intensity ratios to FIP bias as a function of
velocity. The ﬁgure clearly shows 5 curves increasing as a function
of velocity, that reach their maximum (with the highest FIP bias in
the sample) at the highest velocities (∼300 km s−1).

There are two uncertainties to note regarding this technique. First,
strictly speaking the method does not necessarily ﬁnd all the highest
FIP bias. If there are appreciable asymmetries in the red wings of the
Si X 258.375Å and S X 264.223Å lines these could produce high

levels of FIP bias that would not be detected. Fortunately, detectable
red wing asymmetries are not common at the formation temperatures
of these lines (McIntosh et al. 2012). Second, the FIP bias is not
always higher in the blue wing. In the test sample of results in Fig. 4,
the vast majority (80%) of the curves are either ﬂat or increasing with
velocity, but a small minority (20%) show a decrease in FIP bias. So
it is most revealing to look at the actual magnitudes of the FIP bias,
and for that reason we computed spatial maps of the Si/S intensity as
a function of velocity for the EIS rasters shown later in Sect. 3 (Fig.
6). We use the same technique for these maps, but in this case we also
ﬁlter out signals that are unlikely to be real. This was done by taking
the median value of the background in the 200—-250 km s−1 range,
for each Si X 258.375Å and S X 264.223Å line proﬁle separately,
and setting the interpolated proﬁles to zero if the intensity is less than
this value plus the uncertainty in the radiometric calibration of ∼22%
(Lang et al. 2006). Extreme spikes in FIP bias and values close to
photospheric abundances (within the calibration uncertainty) were
also ﬁltered out.

2.4 Evolutionary Magnetic ﬁeld model

To simulate the coronal ﬁeld evolution of AR 11150 we use the time-
dependent data-driven modelling technique of Mackay et al. (2011).
This technique uses a time sequence of line-of-sight magnetograms
as the lower boundary condition to generate a continuous time series
of non-linear force-free ﬁelds by applying magnetofrictional relax-
ation (Yang et al. 1986). We use the longitudinal component of the
magnetic ﬁeld, an initial ﬁeld condition, and a time sequence of hor-
izontal boundary motions to simulate the evolution of the coronal
magnetic ﬁeld. The structure of the coronal ﬁeld is therefore a result
of the injection of non-potentiality into the corona over hours or days
due to the motions applied at the boundary. Magnetofrictional relax-
ation then acts to relax the coronal ﬁeld, which is in non-equilibrium,
into a non-linear force-free state. Previously, this modelling technique
has been tested and shown to accurately reproduce the coronal evo-
lution and the build up of non-potential magnetic ﬁeld prior to the
eruption of many ARs (Mackay et al. 2011; Gibb et al. 2014; Yardley
et al. 2018a, 2021a). More recently, the method has been used to
distinguish eruptive from non-eruptive active regions for prediction
purposes (Pagano et al. 2019a,b, Pagano et al. 2021 submitted).

The simulations are performed using 40 line-of-sight magne-
tograms taken by SDO/HMI with a cadence of 96 minutes, which
have been cleaned using the clean-up procedures. The cleaned mag-
netograms are interpolated onto a 5122 grid, giving a slightly lower
resolution than the original line-of-sight magnetograms. The magne-
tograms are scaled to ﬁll 70% of the base of the computational box
to avoid unnecessary boundary eﬀects.

We conducted numerous simulations where we altered the initial
conditions, boundary conditions and coronal parameters to ﬁnd a
model that best ﬁt the observed coronal evolution of AR 11150. Here
we consider two of the models that were produced, one with a linear
force-free ﬁeld initial condition and a closed top boundary and the
other with a potential ﬁeld initial condition and an open top bound-
ary. A linear force-free ﬁeld is used for the initial condition of the
ﬁrst simulation as the coronal loops in the observations appear to
be non-potential. The initial condition is constructed from the ﬁrst
line-of-sight magnetogram in the sequence, which is taken on 2011,
January 29, at 12:00 UT, and is shown in Fig. 5. The sign of the
force-free parameter 𝛼 is assigned using the sense of twist seen in
the magnetic tongues in the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld observations
(Luoni et al. 2011) during the AR’s emergence phase. The value of 𝛼
in the simulation scales with the size of the computational domain. In

this case, we used an 𝛼 value of -9.8×10−9 m−1 to produce a best-ﬁt
model that closely matched the observed coronal evolution of the AR.
The top and side boundaries of the computational box are closed. We
also included Ohmic diﬀusion where the resistive coeﬃcient 𝜂 was
assigned a value of 25 km2 s−1. Coronal diﬀusion is included to pre-
vent the build-up of highly twisted magnetic ﬁeld in the simulations
as this is unrealistic. The second simulation was constructed using a
potential ﬁeld initial condition, an open top boundary and the inclu-
sion of Ohmic diﬀusion. Due to the open nature of the top boundary
the magnetograms were not ﬂux balanced when pre-processing the
magnetograms.

3 RESULTS

Here we present observations of AR 11150. The nature of our study
meant that we had to be cognizant of a wide range of restrictions
when selecting this AR. The observing mode and diagnostics avail-
able from EIS are generally restricted by telemetry constraints, for
example. Hinode is also primarily an activity mission that targets
complex and ﬂaring ARs. There are also restrictions on the magnetic
ﬁeld modelling as the lower boundary conditions, which are based
on the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld measured by HMI, are aﬀected
by instrumental eﬀects at large centre-to-limb angles. Therefore, we
surveyed a sample of 20 relatively simple bipolar ARs (Yardley et al.
2018b, 2021a) that emerged within ±60𝑜, preferably close to disk
centre, and ﬁnally settled on AR 11150. This was tracked by Hin-
ode outside of eclipse season, and EIS observations were made with
a wide ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) covering most of the target region and
including the important abundance diagnostic spectral lines.

We show EIS Fe XIII 202.044Å observations in Fig 6. This spec-
tral line samples plasma formed around 1.8 MK. There are strong
Doppler blue-shifts (10–40 km s−1) in regions of weak intensity at
the AR boundaries to the solar west and east of the primary loop
arcade connecting the two largest opposite polarities. There are also
two compact blue-shifted areas near the footpoints of the loops con-
necting the weaker trailing opposite polarities. We have overlaid
contours encapsulating the top 1/3rd of the FIP bias values on the
composition and Doppler velocity maps in Fig. 6. They show that the

MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2021)

highest FIP bias in this region is located in bright patches close to the
footpoints of the closed ﬁeld loop arcades bordering the edges of the
blue-shifted upﬂowing plasma. The high FIP-bias plasma is therefore
favourably located. These patches persist in the 5-70 km s−1 range
but they weaken and their extent diminishes at higher velocities. This
is consistent with our modelling of asymmetric line proﬁle ratios
(Fig. 3).

Previous EIS observations have also shown that the highest FIP
bias in a small anemone region was concentrated at the loop foot-
points (Baker et al. 2013), but that was a young region emerging in a
coronal hole, so the magnitude of the FIP bias was somewhat lower
(less than ∼2). As discussed, the magnitude of the FIP bias is a useful
diagnostic. Recent work has shown that high FIP bias plasma at the
footpoints of the hot, core AR loops, are the likely source of several
signiﬁcant SEP events that occurred in 2014, January (Brooks &
Yardley 2021), for example. Our analysis reveals that the FIP bias
magnitudes in the high velocity wing of the spectral lines are also
high.

In Fig. 7 we compare the locations of the highest FIP bias with an
AIA 193Å image and HMI magnetogram. The footpoints of the loop
arcades in the AR are rooted close to the main inversion line between
the dominant polarities on the western side, and weaker scattered in-
version lines on the eastern side, and in the trailing spotless magnetic
concentrations.

For further guidance on how the coronal source plasma is conﬁned
and released by the magnetic ﬁeld we turn to the numerical mod-
elling described in Sect. 2. Recall that we used HMI line-of-sight
magnetograms to simulate the evolution of the coronal magnetic
ﬁeld of AR 11150. We took sample magnetic ﬁeld lines at diﬀerent
timesteps from the simulation to compare with the AIA observations
of the coronal loop arcade and determine the goodness-of-ﬁt of the
model. The model that best ﬁts the observed coronal loops in this
case uses a linear force-free ﬁeld initial condition, closed top bound-
ary and includes Ohmic diﬀusion. We also include analysis of the
model produced by using a potential ﬁeld initial condition, an open
top boundary and including Ohmic diﬀusion.

Here we show examples of the evolution of the magnetic topology
of AR 11150, from the best-ﬁt model over a period of ∼30 hours
surrounding the EIS observations, compared to AIA 171Å images

and 110 km s−1. We highlighted contours on the 70 km s−1 image, and they delineate values ∼2.7. Colour bars show the Doppler velocity and FIP bias scales.

in Fig. 8. The representative ﬁeld lines drawn from the model show
a good match with the observed loop structures in the Figure. Note
also the growth and expansion of the AR. The dominant magnetic
polarities clearly separate between 20UT on January 30 (left panels)
and 01UT on February 1 (right panels), and the loops in the arcade
connecting the polarities appear longer.

Based on theoretical models and observations, the general view
is that plasma emerging with a photospheric composition needs to
be conﬁned in closed magnetic ﬁeld for the FIP eﬀect to operate.
Typically it takes 2 days to reach coronal abundances, and the longer
the plasma is conﬁned the larger the FIP bias will become (Widing
& Feldman 2001), at least until the AR begins to disperse (Baker
et al. 2015). AR 11150 was visible even in far-side solar images at
least a week before. Our EIS observations and modelling also suggest
that as AR 11150 grows and expands, the oldest loops are pushed
towards the AR periphery, so that the plasma conﬁned longest at the

footpoints, with the highest FIP bias, ends up located close to the
blue-shifted upﬂows (Fig. 6). The boundaries of these areas are also
preferential locations for magnetic reconnection to occur that can
allow the plasma to escape. This can occur in several ways and we
demonstrate two possible processes here.

In Fig. 9 we show a side-view of the modelled magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁguration corresponding to the lower middle panel of Fig. 8.
Recall that this model used a closed top boundary to match the
observed closed coronal loops, so there is no open ﬁeld. In the right
panel we show the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration from a second model
designed to capture the open ﬁeld structure of the AR. This model
uses a potential ﬁeld as the initial condition and has an open top
boundary. In Fig. 10 we draw a schematic cartoon to highlight the
two scenarios.

In the ﬁrst model, the location of the diverging closed ﬁelds associ-
ated with the main positive polarity (MPP) of the AR corresponds to

the location of the upﬂows observed to the west of the AR. Therefore,
the observed upﬂows are also located in regions where ﬁeld-opening
component reconnection can occur between closed ﬁelds connecting
the main positive and negative polarities of the AR (MPP and MNP),
and nearly-parallel closed ﬁelds connecting to strong quiet Sun mag-
netic ﬁeld (LNP) leading the AR to the west, as shown in Fig. 10. In
the open-ﬁeld model, the location of the open ﬁeld lines associated
with the main negative polarity (MNP) of the AR corresponds to
the upﬂows observed to the east of the AR, and the location of the
closed ﬁeld of the trailing positive polarity (TPP) corresponds to the
upﬂows observed to its west. Therefore, interchange reconnection
(Crooker et al. 2002) can occur between the open ﬁeld connecting
to the main negative polarity (MNP) of the AR, and the oppositely-
directed closed ﬁeld connecting the polarities of the trailing spotless
region (TNP and TPP), also shown in Fig. 10.

4 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We recently used direct comparisons of remote spectroscopic com-
position measurements and in-situ particle detections to identify the
likely sources of the signiﬁcant SEP events from AR 11944 in 2014,
January, as the footpoints of the hot, coronal loops in the core of
the AR (Brooks & Yardley 2021). Highly fractionated plasma was
detected in these locations. Here we have investigated AR 11150,
to see whether similar composition signatures are seen in another

MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2021)

typical AR, and to more fully understand the magnetic structure of
the AR to see if we can learn more about how the plasma is produced
and is ultimately released.

Our observations identify speciﬁc features and locations in this
AR that produce highly fractionated plasma. It appears that, in this
case, the footpoints of the longest outer coronal loops of an expanding
closed ﬁeld arcade, contain plasma that has been conﬁned the longest
in the region closest to where the elemental fractionation mechanism
operates; the top of the chromosphere – as already discussed by
Brooks & Yardley (2021). The plasma conﬁned at these footpoints
therefore has the highest FIP bias. In this AR, we were able to detect
it only by looking in the weaker high speed blue wing asymmetries
of the EUV spectral line proﬁles.

Our modelling shows multiple pathways involving interchange or
component reconnection by which this plasma can eventually be
released, but these processes also free conﬁned plasma from other
locations in the loop arcade (not just from the footpoints). This should
lead to the footpoint material mixing with other plasma that was
previously conﬁned in the AR core. Even if the magnitude of the FIP
bias is a signature of a diﬀerent heliospheric component (solar wind
or SEPs), and the highly fractionated plasma is formed in special
conditions within the same structure, the mechanism by which this
plasma escapes from the AR is the same. Our results also suggest
that this is a typical process that occurs in many active regions.

Note that we have put forward only two possible escape scenarios.
The EIS Doppler map shows bulk upﬂows and is useful for under-

standing the ﬂow structure of AR 11150 and comparison with other
ARs and models in general. When looking at the FIP bias as a func-
tion of velocity, however, the contours we show in Figs. 6 and 7
indicate emission from plasma that is upﬂowing at 70 km s−1. Such
plasma can already outﬂow if the ﬁeld in these regions is open by
any process. It also means that there is potentially a continual supply
of such material around the AR that can be accelerated as SEPs if an
appropriate event occurs.
