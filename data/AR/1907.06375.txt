ABSTRACT

Hypervelocity stars are rare objects, mostly main-sequence (MS) B stars, traveling so fast that they will eventually escape from the
Milky Way. Recently, it has been shown that the popular Hills mechanism, in which a binary system is disrupted via a close encounter
with the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center, may not be their only ejection mechanism. The analyses of Gaia data ruled
out a Galactic center origin for some of them, and instead indicated that they are extreme disk runaway stars ejected at velocities
exceeding the predicted limits of classical scenarios (dynamical ejection from star clusters or binary supernova ejection). We present
the discovery of a new extreme disk runaway star, PG 1610+062, which is a slowly pulsating B star bright enough to be studied in
detail. A quantitative analysis of spectra taken with ESI at the Keck Observatory revealed that PG 1610+062 is a late B-type MS star
of 4–5 M(cid:12) with low projected rotational velocity. Abundances (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe) were derived diﬀerentially
with respect to the normal B star HD 137366 and indicate that PG 1610+062 is somewhat metal rich. A kinematic analysis, based
on our spectrophotometric distance (17.3 kpc) and on proper motions from Gaia’s second data release, shows that PG 1610+062
was probably ejected from the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm at a velocity of 550 ± 40 km s−1, which is beyond the classical limits.
Accordingly, the star is in the top ﬁve of the most extreme MS disk runaway stars and is only the second among the ﬁve for which the
chemical composition is known.

1. Introduction

Young stars are expected to be found close to their birthplaces,
namely the star-forming regions in the Galactic disk. Finding
them far away in the Galactic halo implies that they have been
forced to leave their primal environment. Two mechanisms are
usually discussed in the literature to explain the presence of these
so-called runaway stars (see, e.g., Hoogerwerf et al. 2001 and
references therein). In the binary-supernova scenario (Blaauw
1961) the massive primary star of a binary explodes as a core-
collapse supernova and the secondary component is released at
almost orbital velocity. In the dynamic scenario (Poveda et al.
1967) the runaway stars are formed via gravitational interac-
tions in young and dense stellar clusters, for instance close
binary-binary encounters, where the least massive star is usu-
ally set free. With typical ejection velocities below a few hun-
dred km s−1, both of these disk runaway scenarios are by far less
powerful than the Hills mechanism (Hills 1988), which describes
the disruption of a binary system during a close ﬂyby of the su-
permassive black hole at the Galactic center (GC). Due to the
strong tidal forces, one component is captured while the other
is able to leave the site at very high velocity (up to thousands
of km s−1). To highlight their unique origin (and to follow the
nomenclature by Vickers et al. 2015), stars stemming from this
particular mechanism are referred to as Hills stars in this work.

Apart from their formation channels, ejected stars may also be
classiﬁed according to whether they are gravitationally bound
to or unbound from the Milky Way. Stars exceeding their local
escape velocity from the Galaxy are commonly called hyperve-
locity stars (HVSs), the ﬁrst of which were discovered in 2005
(Brown et al. 2005, Hirsch et al. 2005, Edelmann et al. 2005).
A dedicated spectroscopic survey covering 29% of the sky re-
vealed 21 candidate HVSs, all of which are late B-type stars
that are unbound from the Milky Way if they are main-sequence
(MS) stars, and thus at distances of 50–120 kpc (Brown et al.
2014). Until recently, the Hills mechanism was widely assumed
to be the only ejection scenario that is capable of producing MS
HVSs (Brown 2015). However, high-precision astrometry from
Gaia’s second data release (DR; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018)
shows that some of the candidate HVSs no longer qualify as
Hills stars because the GC can be most likely ruled out as their
spatial origin (Irrgang et al. 2018a). Because the ejection veloci-
ties of those dismissed Hills stars are higher than the upper limits
for the two “classical” disk ejection scenarios mentioned above,
a powerful yet neglected or unknown mechanism (e.g., dynam-
ical interactions with massive stars or intermediate-mass black
holes) must be at work (Irrgang et al. 2018a). To gain deeper in-
sights, more stars ejected by this mechanism have to be studied
in detail. Here, we investigate PG 1610+062, a blue star at high
Galactic latitude (b = +37.80◦). It was ﬁrst discovered during the

ture of the atmosphere is computed in local thermodynamic equi-
librium (LTE) with Atlas12 (Kurucz 1996). Departures from
LTE are then accounted for by applying updated versions of
Detail and Surface (Giddings 1981; Butler & Giddings 1985).
The Detail code computes population numbers in non-LTE by
numerically solving the coupled radiative transfer and statisti-
cal equilibrium equations. The Surface code uses the resulting
departure coeﬃcients and more detailed line-broadening data
to compute the ﬁnal synthetic spectrum. All three codes have
been recently updated to allow for level dissolution of hydrogen
– following the description by Hubeny et al. (1994) and using
line broadening tables by Tremblay & Bergeron (2009) – and
non-LTE feedback on the atmospheric structure (Irrgang et al.
2018b).

In order to minimize systematic uncertainties, we carried out
a diﬀerential abundance analysis with respect to the B-type star
HD 137366, for which a high-quality spectrum (R ≈ 48 000,
S/N ≈ 470 in the visual) taken with Feros (Kaufer et al. 1999)
is available. This particular object was chosen because, on the
one hand, it is nearby and thus a representative of B-type stars
in the solar neighborhood and, on the other hand, it is almost a
spectroscopic twin of PG 1610+062 (see Figs. A.1–A.9) making
it an ideal target for a diﬀerential abundance study.

The results of the spectroscopic analyses are summarized in
Table 1. Both objects are late B-type stars with slow projected
rotation ((cid:51) sin(i) ∼ 15 km s−1), i.e., they exhibit very sharp metal
lines. While the abundance pattern of HD 137366 is very similar
to those of other young B-type stars in the solar neighborhood
(cf. Nieva & Przybilla 2012), there is a uniform enrichment in
the elemental abundances of PG 1610+062 (Fig. 1) which indi-
cates a higher baseline metallicity. At least to some extent, this is
expected because the star originates ∼ 1.8 kpc closer to the GC
than the Sun (see Sect. 4) so that Galactic abundance gradients
(see, e.g., Nieva & Przybilla 2012 and references therein) come
into play. Stellar parameters (Table 2) are based on comparing
the stars’ positions in a (Teﬀ, log(g)) diagram to single-star evo-
lutionary tracks by Georgy et al. (2013). The two objects are
consistent with being young (∼ 83 Myr), massive (∼ 4–5 M(cid:12))
MS stars. In principle, the derived values for Teﬀ, log(g), and
(cid:51) sin(i) also ﬁt those of blue horizontal branch stars. This op-
tion, however, is very unlikely because the abundance patterns
of those evolved objects are strongly altered by diﬀusion pro-
cesses, an eﬀect that is not observed here.

3. Photometric analysis

3.1. Spectral energy distribution

Spectral energy distributions (see Fig. A.10) were also investi-
gated in order to cross-check atmospheric parameters and to de-
rive spectrophotometric distances. Table 3 lists the parameters
derived from ﬁtting Atlas12 models to the available photometric
measurements. For both targets, spectroscopic and photometric
results are consistent with each other, with almost identical ef-
fective temperatures. The spectrophotometric distances d given
in Table 2 are based on the corresponding stellar radii R(cid:63) and on
the angular diameters Θ = 2R(cid:63)/d from Table 3. For the nearby
reference star HD 137366, the parallax measurement from Gaia
DR2 is highly signiﬁcant ((cid:36) = 2.8014 ± 0.0566 mas) and can
thus be exploited as a consistency check. The agreement be-
tween parallactic (1/(cid:36) = 357 ± 8 pc) and spectrophotometric
distance (see Table 2) is perfect, validating its MS nature and
showing that our spectrophotometric distance estimates are trust-
worthy. This is important for PG 1610+062, which is quite dis-

dance ratios (bottom) of PG 1610+062 with respect to the solar neigh-

of the quadratic sums of the statistical uncertainties given in Table 1,
and thus represent 99% conﬁdence intervals.

Palomar-Green survey (Green et al. 1986) where it was classiﬁed
as a horizontal branch B star. Apart from a re-classiﬁcation as
MS B-type star by Geier et al. (2015), no attempt has been made
since then to study this object in more detail. The star attracted
our attention in the course of the MUCHFUSS project (Geier
et al. 2011) because a set of low-resolution spectra indicated that
its radial velocity might be variable (Geier et al. 2015). Unlike
the faint stars of the HVS sample, which have visual magnitudes
between 17.5 and 20 mag (Brown et al. 2014), PG 1610+062 is
bright enough (V = 15.6 mag) for a high-precision quantita-
tive spectroscopic (Sect. 2) and photometric (Sect. 3) analysis.
A kinematic investigation (Sect. 4) yields an ejection velocity of
550 ± 40 km s−1, granting PG 1610+062 a place in the top ﬁve of
the most extreme disk runaway MS stars known to date (Sect. 5).

2. Spectroscopic analysis

The spectroscopic analysis is based on four medium-resolution
(R ≈ 8000) spectra of decent individual signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N ≈ 60 − 110 in the visual) obtained with the ESI spectro-
graph (Sheinis et al. 2002) mounted at the Keck II telescope and
based on low-resolution spectra taken with the SDSS spectro-
graph (Smee et al. 2013, R ≈ 1500 − 2500, S/N ≈ 102 in the
visual) and the Twin spectrograph1 mounted at the 3.5 m tele-
scope at Calar Alto observatory (R ≈ 1500 − 2500, S/N ≈ 160 in
the visual, coadded from 14 individual spectra).

The quantitative analysis strategy and the applied models are
explained in detail in Irrgang et al. (2014). In short, a simulta-
neous ﬁt of all spectra over their entire spectral range is per-
formed to constrain all parameters (i.e., atmospheric parameters
and chemical abundances) at the same time. The underlying syn-
thetic spectra are based on the hybrid approach, where the struc-

3.2. Light curve
PG 1610+062 lies right inside the instability domain of slowly
pulsating B (SPB) stars (see, e.g., Moravveji 2016) and is thus
expected to pulsate if it is a MS star. The ATLAS variable star
catalog (Heinze et al. 2018) indeed classiﬁes it as a candidate
variable star. Because this classiﬁcation is based on a purely au-
tomated procedure, we decided to reanalyze the ATLAS data to
test the robustness of the results. The outcome of this exercise,
which is presented in the Appendix, conﬁrms the oscillation pe-
riod reported by Heinze et al. (2018) of 4.336721 days. More-
over, it shows that PG 1610+062 exhibits oscillation properties
(see Table A.10) that are characteristic of SPB stars (see, e.g.,
Catelan & Smith 2015 and references therein). Another typical
feature of SPB stars are temporal distortions of the line proﬁles
(see, e.g., Irrgang et al. 2016). Spectra with very high spectral
resolution and S/N are required to resolve them, which unfortu-

nately are not available. At the limited quality of our spectra, the
variations may only lead to small changes in the radial velocity
on the order of a few km s−1, which we and Geier et al. (2015)
indeed observed. We conclude that PG 1610+062 is an SPB star,
which supports our classiﬁcation as a MS star.

4. Kinematic analysis
To investigate the origin of PG 1610+062, a detailed kinematic
investigation was carried out (i.e., the star’s trajectory was traced
back to the Galactic disk; see Fig. 2). Only the most recent disk-
crossing event is considered here because all the others occurred
too far in the past to be compatible with the lifetime of the star.
Systematic uncertainties were estimated by applying three diﬀer-
ent models for the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, all
of which are axisymmetric three-component models with iden-
tical mathematical forms for the bulge and disk, but with their
own parameter values and varying expressions for the dark mat-
ter halo component (see Irrgang et al. 2013 for details). Because
the Galactocentric radii traveled by the program star (roughly
between 12.4–6.5 kpc) lie in a regime where the halo compo-
nent is the dominating acceleration force (see, e.g., Fig. 1 in
Kenyon et al. 2008), these three models are ideally suited to as-
sess systematic uncertainties, which turned out to be completely
negligible. A comparison with recent analyses of the motion of
globular clusters, satellite galaxies, and extreme velocity stars
shows that the models’ mass distributions and local escape ve-
locities are consistent with results from Gaia DR2 astrometry
(Irrgang et al. 2018a). Statistical uncertainties in the spectropho-
tometric distance, radial velocity, and proper motions from Gaia
DR2 (Lindegren et al. 2018; Gaia DR2 4450123955938796160,
µα cos δ = −0.616±0.076 mas yr−1, µδ = 0.176±0.042 mas yr−1)
were propagated via a Monte Carlo procedure with 100 000 runs
that simultaneously and independently varies the individual pa-
rameters assuming Gaussian distributions for each parameter,
while also accounting for asymmetric error bars and the correla-
tion (0.5031) between the two proper motion components. The

Notes. The given uncertainties are 1σ errors. (a) Assuming a MS nature,
Li et al. (2018) give a Galactic rest-frame velocity at a disk intersec-
tion of 697 ± 12 km s−1, which transforms to the given ejection velocity.
(b) Based on the distance and radial velocity from Heber et al. (2008)
and on proper motions from Gaia DR2.

Fig. 2. Three-dimensional orbit of PG 1610+062 in a Galactic Cartesian
coordinate system in which the z-axis points to the Galactic north pole.
The nine trajectories (red lines; arrows indicate the star’s current posi-
tion) are computed in Model I of Irrgang et al. (2013) and illustrate the
eﬀects of uncertainties in the distance, proper motions, and radial veloc-
ity. Orbits were computed back in time until they reached the Galactic
plane. The small black rimmed, shaded areas are 1σ (red) and 2σ (light
blue) contours for the intersection of the Galactic plane. The thick blue
solid lines schematically represent the loci of the spiral arms 41 Myr ago
based on the polynomial logarithmic arm model of Hou & Han (2014)
and the Galactic rotation curve of Model I of Irrgang et al. (2013). The
current positions of the Sun and the GC are marked by a yellow circled
dot ((cid:12)) and a black plus sign (+), respectively. The orbit is characteristic
of a disk runaway star.

outcome of the kinematic analysis is summarized in Table 4 and
is perfectly consistent with a Galactic disk runaway scenario.
PG 1610+062 was shot into the halo ∼ 41 Myr ago from a re-
gion with a Galactocentric radius of ∼ 6.5 kpc, which possibly
coincided with the location of the now nearby Carina-Sagittarius
spiral arm. Despite its huge ejection velocity of 550 ± 40 km s−1,
it is still gravitationally bound to the Milky Way because the
ejection vector was somewhat opposite to Galactic rotation.

In contrast, the kinematic properties of HD 137366 are typi-
cal of thin-disk stars in the solar neighborhood (see Fig. A.13).

5. Summary and discussion

With the release of Gaia DR2, there is growing observational
evidence that MS stars can be accelerated to beyond their lo-
cal Galactic escape velocity from within the Galactic disk, i.e.,
without the involvement of the supermassive black hole at the
GC (Li et al. 2018, Irrgang et al. 2018a, Hattori et al. 2018).
While the ﬁrst of these unbound disk runaway stars (which are
sometimes referred to as hyper-runaway stars; see Przybilla et al.
2008), HD 271791, could still be explained in the framework of

the “classical” disk ejection scenarios outlined in Sect. 1, namely
via an extreme case of the supernova mechanism with additional
boost by Galactic rotation (Przybilla et al. 2008), this is not the
case for most of the other unbound disk runaway candidates be-
cause their intrinsic ejection velocities (see Table 5) exceed the
respective upper limits of ∼ 400 km s−1 (see Irrgang et al. 2018a
for an extensive discussion on the upper limits). Close encoun-
ters with very massive stars or intermediate-mass black holes of-
fer, in principle, a straightforward explanation (see, e.g., Irrgang
et al. 2018a and references therein). However, the rates at which
those strong dynamical interactions may occur are not well con-
strained because the actual number of massive perturbers and
the conditions in their host clusters are uncertain (see, e.g., Hat-
tori et al. 2018). With only a few objects known so far, it is
still crucial to increase the sample of stars ejected by this pow-
erful mechanism in order to provide tighter observational con-
straints on the theory. Here, we present the discovery of a new
member of this tiny group, PG 1610+062. Owing to the unprece-
dented precision of proper motions from Gaia DR2 and that this
star is relatively close (∼ 17.3 kpc) compared to many other ex-
treme velocity stars, it is possible to study it in great detail. Our
spectroscopic, photometric, and kinematic analyses suggest that
PG 1610+062 is a young B-type MS star originating from a rela-
tively small area close to the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm, which
today is not too far away from the Sun. Although it is not grav-
itationally unbound from the Milky Way, it is in the top ﬁve of
the most extreme MS disk runaway stars (see Table 5) and is,
after LAMOST-HVS1, only the second of these ﬁve for which
the chemical composition is known.

Fig. A.1. Comparison of best-ﬁtting model spectrum (red line) with normalized observed spectrum (black line) for HD 137366 (left, Feros) and
PG 1610+062 (right, ESI). Light colors mark regions that have been excluded from ﬁtting (e.g., due to the presence of features that are not
properly included in our models). For the sake of clarity, only the strongest of the lines used in the analysis are labeled. Residuals χ are shown as
well. Telluric correction is performed via interpolation within the pre-calculated grid of transmission spectra presented by Moehler et al. (2014).
Although the atmospheric conditions used in this spectral library are tailored to Cerro Paranal, the two free parameters of airmass and precipitable
water vapor content are enough to ensure a decent representation of many telluric features for diﬀerent observing sites and weather conditions.
Regions where telluric features are not properly reproduced by this approach have been excluded as well.

Fig. A.10. Comparison of synthetic and observed photometry for PG 1610+062 (top ﬁgure) and HD 137366 (bottom ﬁgure). The main panels
show the spectral energy distributions. The colored data points are ﬁlter-averaged ﬂuxes which were converted from observed magnitudes (the
respective ﬁlter widths are indicated by the dashed horizontal lines), while the gray solid line represents the best-ﬁtting model (degraded to a
spectral resolution of 6 Å). The residual panels at the bottom and on the side show the diﬀerences between synthetic and observed magnitudes and
colors, respectively. The extinction law by Fitzpatrick (1999) with the color excess as free parameter was used to account for interstellar reddening.
The photometric systems are color-coded as follows: violet: GALEX (DR5, Bianchi et al. 2011, corrected using the description given in Camarota
& Holberg 2014); gold: SDSS (DR9, Ahn et al. 2012); blue: Johnson-Cousins (APASS DR9, Henden et al. 2015); cyan: Gaia (Evans et al. 2018),
Hipparcos (van Leeuwen 2007); brown: Tycho (van Leeuwen 2007); crimson: Pan-STARRS (Chambers et al. 2017), Geneva (Rufener 1988); red:
2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006); magenta: WISE (Cutri & et al. 2014).

at the ﬁxed reference epoch Tref. The index j ∈ {c, o} refers to
the two passbands. The best-ﬁtting parameters are listed in Ta-
ble A.10 and the corresponding phased light curves are shown
in Fig. A.11. The oscillation period reported by Heinze et al.
(2018), 4.336721 days, is nicely conﬁrmed here. However, due
to the very scarce sampling, alias frequencies at 1 − νosc, 1 + νosc,
and 2 − νosc are almost as likely as νosc itself (see Fig. A.12).
Without better data coverage, it remains unclear which of them
is actually the true one.

ting the ATLAS light curves with the model given in Eq. (A.1), as a
function of the oscillation frequency νosc, which is sampled in steps of
0.01/686.25 d−1 to ensure that phase shifts are always less than 0.01.

Fig. A.11. Phased ATLAS light curves for PG 1610+062: the measure-
ments are represented by black crosses with error bars while the best-
ﬁtting model (see Table A.10) is indicated by the red solid curve. The
red dashed line indicates the derived mean magnitude. Residuals χ are
shown as well.

After removing a few obvious outliers, the available ATLAS
light curves (which consist of 90 measurements in the cyan (c)
band spread over 653.29 days and 88 data points in the orange (o)
band spread over 686.25 days) were ﬁtted with a cosine function
of the form

The time-dependent magnitude mag j(t) is thus parameterized by
a mean magnitude mag j, an oscillation semiamplitude A j, and
an oscillation frequency νosc. The parameter φref is the phase
