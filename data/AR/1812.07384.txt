Abstract. This paper focuses on using the ﬁrst curvature κ(t) of trajectory to describe the
stability of linear time-invariant system. We extend the results for two and three-dimensional
systems [Y. Wang, H. Sun, Y. Song et al., arXiv:1808.00290] to n-dimensional systems. We
prove that for a system ˙r(t) = Ar(t), (i) if there exists a measurable set whose Lebesgue measure
κ(t)
is greater than zero, such that for all initial values in this set,
does not exist, then the zero solution of the system is stable; (ii) if the matrix A is invertible,
and there exists a measurable set whose Lebesgue measure is greater than zero, such that for all
κ(t) = +∞, then the zero solution of the system is asymptotically
initial values in this set,

κ(t) 6= 0 or

1. Introduction

It is well known that stability is an important subject in the control theory, and curvature
is the core concept of diﬀerential geometry. We wish to establish the relationship between the
curvatures of state trajectories and the stability of linear systems. In fact, in [8] the authors gave
the description of stability for two and three-dimensional linear time-invariant systems ˙r(t) = Ar(t)
based on the curvature and torsion of curve r(t).

In this paper, we focus on the higher dimensional systems and give them a geometric description
for the stability. To achieve this goal, the deﬁnition of the higher curvatures of curves in Rn by
Gluck [3] is used, where the ﬁrst and second curvature are the generalization of curvature and
torsion of curves in R3, respectively. We will develop the methods arised in [8], and use the ﬁrst
curvature to describe the stability of the zero solution of linear time-invariant system ˙r(t) = Ar(t).

Our main results are as follows.

Theorem 1.1. Suppose that ˙r(t) = Ar(t) is a linear time-invariant system, where A is an n

The following concepts and results can be found in [1–7].

2.1. Linear Time-Invariant Systems and Stability.

Deﬁnition 2.1 ([7]). The system of ordinary diﬀerential equations

(2.1)

˙r(t) = Ar(t)

is called a linear time-invariant system, where A is an n
˙r(t) is the derivative of r(t).

Proposition 2.2 ([7]). Let A be an n
problem

n real matrix. Then for a given r0 ∈

×

Rn, the initial value

(2.2)

has a unique solution given by

(2.3)

˙r(t) = Ar(t),

r(0) = r0

(

r(t) = etAr0.

The curve r(t) is called the trajectory of system (2.2) with the initial value r0 ∈

Rn.

Deﬁnition 2.3 ( [2, 6]). The solution r(t)
0 of diﬀerential equations (2.1) is called the zero
solution of the linear time-invariant system. If for every constant ε > 0, there exists a δ = δ(ε) > 0,
), where r(t) = etAr(0) is a solution
such that
of (2.1), and r(0) is the initial value of r(t), then we say that the zero solution of system (2.1) is
stable. If the zero solution is not stable, then we say that it is unstable.

matrix A have nonpositive real parts, namely,

(i = 1, 2,

· · ·

and the eigenvalues with zero real parts correspond only to the simple elementary factors of matrix
A.

The zero solution of system (2.1) is asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues of matrix

A have negative real part, namely,

Proposition 2.5 ([2]). Suppose that A and B are two n
namely, there exists an n
let v(t) = P r(t). Then the system after the transformation becomes

n real invertible matrix P , such that A = P −1BP . For system (2.1),

System (2.4) is said to be equivalent to system (2.1), and v(t) = P r(t) is called an equivalence
transformation.

Proposition 2.6 ([2]). Let A and B be two n
n real matrices, and A is similar to B. Then the
zero solution of the system ˙r(t) = Ar(t) is (asymptotically) stable if and only if the zero solution
of the system ˙v(t) = Bv(t) is (asymptotically) stable.

In this section, we establish the relationship between curvatures of trajectories of two equivalent

systems.

Let curve r(t) be the trajectory of system (2.2), and curve v(t) the trajectory of system ˙v(t) =

Bv(t), v(0) = v0, where A = P −1BP , and v0 = P r0. Suppose that for each t, the vectors

˙r(t), ¨r(t),

, r(m)(t)

are linearly independent. Since v(i)(t) = P r(i)(t) (i = 1, 2,

r(t), and curvatures κv,1(t), κv,2(t),

, κv,m(t) of curve v(t), respectively.

, κr,m(t) of curve

· · ·

Now, we prove the following theorem.

· · ·

Theorem 3.1. Suppose that linear time-invariant system ˙r(t) = Ar(t) is equivalent to system
˙v(t) = Bv(t), where A = P −1BP , and v(t) = P r(t) is the equivalence transformation. Let κr,i(t)
and κv,i(t) be the ith (i = 1, 2,
1) curvatures of trajectories r(t) and v(t), respectively.
Then we have

Proof. First, recall that A = P −1BP , where P is an n
2.11, we obtain a singular value decomposition of P , namely,

×

n real invertible matrix. Using Proposition

P = U ∆V T,

where U and V are two n

b(t) = ∆a(t) = ∆V Tr(t) = U −1v(t).

Then we obtain two new linear time-invariant systems

˙a(t) = N a(t),

˙b(t) = ˜N b(t),

where N = V TA(V T)−1, and ˜N = U −1BU .

Since U, V are n

· · ·

In fact, because a(t) = V Tr(t), we have a(k)(t) = V Tr(k)(t) (k = 1, 2,

and Er,i(t) denote the ith vector obtained by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (2.6) for vec-
, r(m)(t), respectively. Then we have Ea,i(t) =
tors ˙a(t), ¨a(t),
V TEr,i(t) (i = 1, 2,

4. Real Jordan Blocks

In order to prove Theorem 1.1, we can transform A to its real Jordan canonical form by using

Proposition 2.12 and Theorem 3.1, and focus on the case of real Jordan canonical form.

Assume that A is a matrix in real Jordan canonical form, then A is a block diagonal matrix

with the following four types of real Jordan blocks:

Remark 4.1. In the remainder of this paper, we call these four types of real Jordan blocks R1, RH,
C2 and CH block for short, respectively.

We examine these four types of blocks in the following subsections.

There are similar results for the following cases in Section 4 and 5. In fact, we have Theorem

7. Conclusion

The main result of this paper, Theorem 1.1, is proved. Firstly, through the analysis of higher
curvatures of trajectories of systems, we give the relationship between curvatures of trajectories
of two equivalent linear time-invariant systems. Secondly, for each type of real Jordan blocks, we
analyze the relationship between the ﬁrst curvature and stability. Finally, we prove a result for
real Jordan canonical form, which completes the proof of the main theorem.

As Theorem 1.1 shows, two suﬃcient conditions for stability of the zero solution of linear time-
invariant systems, based on the ﬁrst curvature, are given. For each case of the theorem, we give
an example to illustrate the result.

Further, we will investigate nonlinear control for the stability by using geometric description.
