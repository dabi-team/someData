ABSTRACT

We investigate the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structure of a blowout jet originated in the west edge of NOAA
Active Region (AR) 11513 on 02 July 2012 by means of recently developed forced ﬁeld extrapolation (FFE) model.
The results show that the blowout jet was caused by the eruption of the magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) consisting of
twisted ﬁeld lines. We further calculate the twist number Tw and squashing factor Q of the reconstructed magnetic
ﬁeld and ﬁnd that (1) the MFR corresponds well to the high Tw region (2) the MFR outer boundary corresponds
well to the high Q region, probably interpreting the bright structure at the base of the jet. The twist number of the
MFR is estimated to be Tw = −1.54 ± 0.67. Thus, the kink instability is regarded as the initiation mechanism of the
blowout jet as Tw reaching or even exceeding the threshold value of the kink instability. Our results also indicate that
the bright point at the decaying phase is actually comprised of some small loops that are heated by the reconnection
occurred above. In summary, the blowout jet is mostly consistent with the scenario proposed by Moore et al. (2010)
except that the kink instability is found to be a possible trigger.

1. INTRODUCTION

The concept of “blowout jet” was ﬁrst introduced by Moore et al. (2010) based on the morphological description of
X-ray jet in the Hinode/X-ray Telescope movie. The broad spire and bright base arch of the “blowout jet” distinguish
from the thin spire and relatively dim base arch of standard jet. In the widely accepted scenario of a blowout jet
(Moore et al. 2010; Raouaﬁ et al. 2016): the sheared or twisted arch ﬁeld is supposed to emerge from below the
photosphere, forming a current sheet at the interface between the arch ﬁeld and ambient open ﬁeld. The onset of
magnetic reconnection at the current sheet shows the similar feature with the standard jet apparently, then the sheared
or twisted arch ﬁeld is erupted outward as the key structure of a CME (Chen 2011). Among the total number of 109
jets examined in Moore et al. (2010) and Moore et al. (2013), 50 are blowout, 53 are standard, 6 are ambiguous.

A miniﬁlament whose magnetic structure is argued to be a helical MFR, is often observed at the base of the blowout jet
(Hong et al. 2011, 2013; Shen et al. 2012; Adams et al. 2014; Sterling et al. 2015). The existence of MFR is supported
by the helical structure in the spire during the untwisting motion of the erupting mass (e.g., Patsourakos et al. 2008;
Nistic et al. 2009; Shen et al. 2011; Curdt et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2012; Morton et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2012; Lee et al.
2013; Zhang & Ji 2014; Liu et al. 2014; Cheung et al. 2015). In addition, 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) jet models
(Pariat et al. 2009, 2010, 2015; Rachmeler et al. 2010; Cheung et al. 2015; Karpen et al. 2017) according to the eruption
of the twisted magnetic ﬁeld also show the same helical motion as the observations.

Magnetic structures of the source regions of the blowout jets have been modeled using potential (Liu et al. 2011;
Zhang et al. 2012), linear (Moreno-Insertis et al. 2008) and non-linear force-free modelings (Schmieder et al. 2013;
Guo et al. 2013). The previous works just unveiled the weakly sheared core ﬁelds and opened ambient ﬁelds. The
twisted MFRs in which more magnetic free energy is stored to power the blowout jets, however, have never been
disclosed.

In this letter, we report an MFR at the base of a blowout jet. The MFR is successfully reconstructed by recently
developed FFE model (Zhu et al. 2013, 2016). To study the change of the magnetic ﬁeld, we make a time series
of extrapolations using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012; Hoeksema et al. 2014) vector
magnetograms. We further calculate the twist number (Berger & Prior 2006) and squashing factor (D´emoulin et al.
1996; Titov et al. 2002; Pariat et al. 2012) to study the property of the MFR. The observational data sets are described
in Section 2, the evolution of the blowout jet is presented in Section 3, the extrapolation results are analyzed in Section
4, which is followed by the discussions and conclusions in Section 5.

2. OBSERVATIONAL DATA

Recurrent jets were observed at the boundary between the AR 11513 and the neighboring coronal hole on July 2,

2012 (see white box in Figure 1). Our attention is paid to the blowout jet occurred at 21:12UT.

HMI onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) provides 45 seconds line of sight (LOS)
magnetograms and 12 minutes vector magnetograms. Both of their pixel size is 0.5′′. The Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) also on board SDO provides full disk images of solar corona at multiple EUV
passbands with cadence of 12 seconds and pixel size of 0.6′′. We also used the Hα data observed at Big Bear Solar
Observatories (BBSO) to study the evolution of the jet in the chromosphere.

3. EVOLUTION OF THE BLOWOUT JET

Figure 2 and online movie show the blowout jet in diﬀerent passbands. Here, the evolution is divided into three

stages.

First stage: before 21:11, the jet’s base appeared as a circular shape (Figure 2 (a1, b1, c1, d1)) which could be the
combination of several dipoles, the loops connect which may be heated. The plasma is observed to intermittently move
out along the open ﬁeld lines even though the whole structure is stable.

Second stage: at 21:11, a bright point at the south of the circular area appeared and then quickly extended to the
north to form a bent tube (pointed by the white arrows in Figure 2 (b2, c2)). The tube increasingly got brightened,
followed by a slowly upward motion (lower dot line in Figure 2 (e)) and a fast ejection motion (upper dot line in
Figure 2 (e)). The strong brightening of the jet’s base suggests that the internal reconnection occurs between the
opposite-polarity stretched legs of the erupting structure. Meanwhile, the jet’s spire shows multi-stranded curtain
structure with rotating motion in the broaden spire (pointed by the yellow arrows in Figure 2 (a3, b3, c3)). All these
are typical morphological characteristics of a blowout jet.

Third stage: at 21:18, the jet’s base and spire started to decay. All bright structure faded away except a dimming

bright point (Figure 2 (a4, b4, c4, d4)).

4. 3D MAGNETIC STRUCTURE OF THE BLOWOUT JET

To understand the magnetic structure and evolution of the jet, we use the FFE model that utilizes the MHD
relaxation method (full MHD equations are solved) to build the equilibrium state of the system that approximate
the solar atmosphere. The HMI vector magnetograms are taken as bottom boundary condition. The FFE model

The yellow arrows in the panel (a) and (d) point to the bright tube and MFR, respectively. The contour in the panel (a, b) in
black/white color represents the LOS magnetic ﬁeld strength of -200G/200G. The yellow/blue lines in the panel (d) outline the
MFR/ambient magnetic ﬁeld. The white ﬁeld lines in the (e) show the small loops at the post jet bright point pointed by the

is particularly suited to compute the magnetic ﬁeld in the chromosphere, transition region and low corona because
of the relatively high plasma β there.
It has been successfully used to reproduce the magnetic structure of Hα
ﬁbrils (Zhu et al. 2016), small ﬁlament (Wang et al. 2016), and bright arcade in the chromosphere or low corona
(Zhao et al. 2017). In the work, the extrapolation is performed in the cubic box resolved by 480*416*128 grid points
with △x = △y = △z = 0.5′′. The photosphere boundary ﬁeld of view for extrapolation is shown in Figure 1.

4.1. The evolution of magnetic structure

Figure 3 (d) shows that an MFR (yellow lines) appears at the source region of the jet. The MFR corresponds well
to the observed bright tube (Figure 3 (a)) as seen in AIA images. With the jet eruption, most of the twisted lines are
released, only leaving some untwisted and open ﬁeld lines in place (Figure 3 (e)). The small loops (white ﬁeld lines
in panel (e)) at the bright point (Figure 3 (b)) are possibly the reconnected ﬁeld lines. Although we can not see the

dynamic process of the jet by extrapolation, the change of the magnetic ﬁeld clearly display that the MFR is ejected
during the jet.

The arrows in Figure 3 (g) show the transverse ﬁeld which is aligned with the MFR. After the jet, the transverse
ﬁeld decreases and becomes disordered (Figure 3 (h,i)). This is consistent with the fact that the eruption of the jet
takes away most of twisted ﬁeld and just leaves some small closed ﬁeld lines and large-scale open ﬁeld.

Berger & Prior (2006) deﬁned the twist of the neighboring magnetic ﬁeld lines, which is related to the parallel electric

current (Jk), as follows:

where the integration is carried out along the speciﬁc ﬁeld line.

D´emoulin et al. (1996) introduced the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) as the generalized topological structure. The
QSLs are deﬁned by high squashing factor Q regions where the connection of the magnetic ﬁeld varies strongly. Q is
deﬁned by mapping the ﬁeld line (Titov et al. 2002):

,

where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the two footpoints of a ﬁeld line.

The code we used to calculate the twist number Tw and squashing factor Q is developed by Liu et al. (2016). To save
computation resource, we select sub-domain x ∈ [130.0, 160.3], y ∈ [231.0, 240.3] and z ∈ [0.0, 10.1] where x (+x towards
west) and y (+y towards north) are the heliocentric coordinate and z is the height. The sub-domain was resolved by
960*880*320 grids when computing Tw and Q. Therefore, the grids are reﬁned by 16 times after extrapolation.

Figure 4(a) shows the extrapolated 3D ﬁeld lines of the MFR. The contour of Tw = −1.5 (see (b)) marks the MFR
accurately. Figure 4 (e) and (f) shows a 2D plane of Tw and Q perpendicular to the axis of the MFR. We can see that
the Tw has a sharp edge which is consistent with the regions of high Q value. In an MFR, ﬁeld lines winding around
an axis have similar connectivity. QSLs separate the twisted ﬁeld lines from ambient ﬁeld lines, which are typical
features of an active-region-scaled MFR (e.g., Titov et al. 2002; Guo et al. 2013; Cheng et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2016).
Assuming Tw = −0.5 as the boundary, ﬁeld lines inside have a twist number of Tw = −1.54 ± 0.67. The twist at the
center of the MFR exceeds to 2.0 turns while decreases to 0.5 toward the edge. T¨or¨ok & Kliem (2003) shows that the
Titov & D´emoulin (1999) MFR is kink unstable for |Tw| > 1.75 with aspect ratio R/r = 5 (R and r are the major
and minor radius of the MFR). The instability threshold decrease with decreasing aspect ratio (T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2003).
Assuming the length (21 arcsec) and width (5.5 arcsec, see Figure 4 (g)) of the extrapolated MFR approximate the
major and minor diameters, respectively. The aspect ratio is estimated to be 3.8, implying a smaller kink-instability
threshold than 1.75 turns. Therefore, the small scale MFR may be marginally kink unstable. The decay index of the
magnetic ﬁeld above the MFR is about 0.3, which means that the MFR is far below the height where torus instability
will occur (the critical decay index requires to be 1.5, Kliem & T¨or¨ok (2006)).

4.3. Noise and change of the magnetic ﬁeld on the photosphere

The noise of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld is large in weak ﬁeld region because of the nonlinear dependence between
the linear polarization and ﬁeld strength. This lead to unreliable vector magnetic ﬁeld inversion in solar quiet regions.
The jet we analyzed occurred at the boundary of an AR and a coronal hole, which is the interface area of the strong

and weak magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the noise of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld at the jet
source region. The SDO/HMI provides the standard deviation of inverted magnetic ﬁeld with data segments ERR.
For example, FIELD ERR and INCLINATION ERR are the standard deviation of ﬁeld strength and inclination angle
relative to the LOS. Hence, it is convenient to compute the uncertainty of the transverse ﬁeld. The temporal proﬁle
of the magnetic ﬁeld is showed in Figure 5. Typically at 21:12 UT, the average LOS ﬁeld, average transverse ﬁeld,
average noise of the transverse ﬁeld, and the average signal to noise of region “R” (surrounded by black curves in
Figure 5 left): are: 28G, 160G, 32G, and 5.4, respectively. The transverse ﬁeld on the photosphere is about 5.7 times
larger than the LOS ﬁeld under the MFR, which indicate the ﬁeld lines at this area are nearly horizontal. This results
in the relatively small noise of transverse ﬁeld. The uncertainty of the transverse ﬁeld is about 18%, 20%, and 36%
at 21:00:00, 21:12:00, and 21:24:00, respectively (see the error bar in Figure 5 right). The high signal to noise of the
data denotes it could be used in extrapolation.

The largely diﬀerent ﬁeld conﬁguration mainly results from the change of transverse magnetic ﬁeld on the photosphere
after the jet took place. The region “R” has a pronounced, 30% decrease of the transverse ﬁeld (solid line in Figure
5 right) from 160G at 21:12:00 before the jet to 112G at 21:24:00 after the jet in 12 minutes. Figure 3 (f-i) also show
decrease and less sheared of the transverse ﬁeld after the jet. The decrease of the positive, negative, and unsigned
LOS ﬁeld (right panel of Figure 5) suggest that the ﬂux cancelation took place at the jet’s source region.

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

A blowout jet was observed on 2 July 2012 at the west edge of AR 11513. In a previous paper, Chen et al. (2015)
suggested that the rotation and shear motion of the magnetic ﬁeld build up the free energy to make the jet blow out.
In the current work, we further study the 3D magnetic structure of the jet’s source region by recently developed FFE
model. The twist number and squashing factor are calculated to analyze the magnetic property of this jet. We have
the following ﬁndings:

First, the transverse magnetic ﬁeld decreased during the jet. The originally twisted and closed ﬁeld lines are released,
manifesting as the bright base and broaden helical spire, ﬁnally just leaving some untwisted and opened ﬁeld lines in
place.

Second, an MFR, reconstructed by the FEE method and being cospatial with the bright tube, is found to exist
before the jet and then disappear after the jet blows out. A sharp boundary of the MFR can be seen at 2D cutting

8

plane of Tw distribution. This boundary also corresponds well with the layer with very high Q value that distinguishes
the twisted ﬁeld lines of the MFR from outside.

Third, the twist number of the MFR is Tw = −1.54 ± 0.67 with the small aspect ratio R/r = 3.8, which indicates
that the blowout jet is likely triggered by kink instability. The low decay index prevents the eruption from torus
instability.

Combining the observed features with reconstructed 3D magnetic structures, we can argue that before the onset of
the blowout jet, a highly twisted MFR exists at the source region of the jet. The twist of the MFR may continuously
increase because of the plasma motion or magnetic cancelation at the photosphere. Homologous jets erupted before
the blowout one remove the restraining overly ﬁeld lines. When the twist exceeds a critical value, kink instability takes
place and leads to the MFR being ejected. As the MFR moving upward, the internal reconnection occurs between the
stretched ﬁeld lines below. The reconnection outﬂows may take on a bright core of the jet. Meanwhile, the eruption of
the heated MFR in the partly opened ambient ﬁeld shows multi-strand curtain structure. The helical motion observed
in the spire indicates the untwisting process of the erupting MFR. Finally, the jet’s base gradually fade away with a
weak bright point. This bright point may denote small loops that are heated by the reconnection above. In short, the
process of blowout jet is mostly consistent with the scenario proposed by Moore et al. (2010), except that the kink
instability is considered to be its initiation mechanism. It has to be pointed out that the direct observation of the
twist, for example the twist between ﬁne structures of a ﬁlament (Wang et al. 2015), is a stronger and direct piece of
evidence for the MFR existence. In the future, more case studies, even a statistical study, of 3D magnetic structures
of blowout jets will be presented.
