ABSTRACT

In this study we report detailed observations of magnetic environment at four footpoints

of two warm coronal loops observed on 5 May 2016 in NOAA AR 12542 (Loop I) and

17 Dec 2015 in NOAA AR 12470 (Loop II). These loops were connecting a plage region

with sunspot periphery (Loop I) and a sunspot umbra (Loop II). We used Solar Dynamics

Observatory (SDO) and Goode Solar Telescope (GST) data to describe the phenomenon and

understand its causes. The study indicates loop brightening episodes were associated with

magnetic ﬂux emergence and cancellation processes observed in SDO’s Helioseismic and

Magnetic Imager (HMI) and GST’s Near InfraRed Imaging Spectrapolarimeter (NIRIS) data.

The observed activity was driven by magnetic reconnection between small-scale emerging

dipoles and large-scale pre-existing ﬁelds, suggesting that the reconnection occurred in the

lower chromosphere at the edge of an extended plage region, where the loops were rooted.

We suggest that plasma, evaporated during these reconnection events, gradually ﬁlled the

loops and as it cooled the visible density front propagated from one footpoint of the loop to

another at a rate of 90-110 km s−1. This study also indicates that at least some of the bright

loops seen in SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly images rooted in sunspot umbra may be

heated due to magnetic activity taking place at the remote (non-sunspot) footpoint.

1. INTRODUCTION

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Coronal loops are observed in UV and X-ray images as bright curved arches that can extend to a quite large

fraction of the solar radius. They are thought to be hot and dense plasma conﬁned by guiding magnetic

ﬂux tubes (e.g., Marsch et al. 2004). Coronal loops can be separated into three different groups depending

on their plasma temperatures: i) cool loops (0.1-1 MK), which were ﬁrst detected in Ultra Violet (UV)

lines by Foukal (1976), ii) warm loops (1-2.0 MK) that are well observed in extreme UV (EUV) (Lenz

1999; Del Zanna 2003), and iii) hot loops (> 2MK), which comprise most of the structures visible in X-ray

images (Nagata et al. 2003). The electron density of coronal loops are measured to range from 108 up to

1012 cm−3, with the highest values typically only seen in ﬂaring loops (Reale 2010).

Plasma diagnostics such as Doppler velocity, density, and temperature measurements are of particular

interest as they reveal the thermal evolution of coronal loops needed for identiﬁcation of the heating mech-

anism. For a recent review on various aspects of coronal loops and 3D modeling see Reale (2014) and Peter

(2015). Imaging and spectroscopic observations in combination with spectrapolarimetry data have provided

information on the coupling between plasma ﬂows and guiding coronal ﬁelds (e.g., Marsch et al. 2004) and

have improved our understanding of physical conditions in coronal loops (e.g., Gupta et al. 2015) and ﬂows

within these loop structures (e.g., Del Zanna & Mason 2003).

Warm coronal loops comprise the majority of intensity structures seen in active regions (ARs) in the UV

spectral range. Their footpoints are emitting at temperatures of around 1.0 MK and their electron density

is of order of 109 cm−3 (Del Zanna 2003). They often show downﬂows in transition region (TR) lines

and upﬂows in UV lines (Tripathi et al. 2009) as well as notable non-thermal velocities near the footpoints

(Hara et al. 2008; Harra & Abramenko 2012). In particular, Tripathi et al. (2009) reported that upﬂows in

coronal loops increase with higher plasma temperatures, while downﬂows near the loop footpoints may

reach up to 60 km s−1, when observed at lower temperature lines. Winebarger et al. (2002) detected line-

of-sight (LOS) ﬂows along warm loops of up to 40 km s−1, while Ofman & Wang (2008) reported speeds

of 74 - 123 km s−1.

The thermal structure of coronal loops is being extensively studied since it may hint to us as to what

mechanism may be responsible for coronal heating. High resolution UV observations seem to indicate that

at spatial scales below 365 km coronal loops exhibit constant density and temperature across their width

3

(Del Zanna & Mason 2003). Winebarger et al. (2014) used High resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) data

to ﬁnd that 70% of Hi-C loop pixels do not show evidence for existence of thermal substructures, while

Aschwanden & Peter (2017) concluded that the Hi-C instrument fully resolves the structure of coronal

loops. Aschwanden & Peter (2017) further argued that the model derived minimal loop width of 550 km is

deﬁned by the spatial extent of the corresponding energy release events, which should be in this case of gran-

ular (macroscopic) scales, thus ruling out the magnetic ﬁeld braiding mechanism operating on unresolved

microscopic scales. At the same time Pontin et al. (2017) simulations revealed that braided structures, even

if they are present in the magnetic ﬁeld, may not always be readily visible in EUV images as such.

Although progress has been made studying physical properties of coronal loops, accurate knowledge of

their heating mechanism still eludes us. It is commonly accepted that energy for coronal heating is stored

in the magnetic ﬁeld and is converted from mechanic energy of convective motions of solar plasma that

stretch, displace, twist, and braid magnetic ﬁeld lines (Klimchuk 2006). The stored magnetic energy may

then be released either via magnetic reconnection process (DC, direct current heating) or dissipation of

waves (AC, alternating current heating). Reconnection requires either the existence of mixed polarity ﬁelds

at the loop footpoints (macroscopics events) or highly braided loops along their length (microscopic scales,

Cirtain et al. 2013). Until recently, both conditions were not frequently observed in the solar atmosphere.

The AC heating mechanism (Klimchuk 2006) may be realized due to rigorous turbulent ﬂows in the photo-

sphere (Abramenko et al. 2011, 2013) capable of rapidly displacing loop footpoints over time scales shorter

than those required for Alfv´en wave to travel from one footpoint to another. Chen et al. (2014) simula-

tions showed that bright UV loops in an emerging active region (AR) may be formed due to dissipation of

electric currents induced by advection of small-scale magnetic elements. Recently van Ballegooijen et al.

(2017) introduced a coronal heating model by Alfv´en wave turbulence, which predicted that neither short

period waves launched within ﬂux tubes nor long-period random footpoint motions are able to satisfac-

tory reproduce the observed physical parameters and energy budget. Yang et al. (2018) modelled loop-loop

reconnection to argue that this mechanism is capable of providing energy necessary for coronal heating.

Since the simulated interacting loops were of comparable spatial scale, this numerical experiment argues in

support of coronal heating via loop braiding mechanism (Parker 1988; Klimchuk 2006; Pontin et al. 2017).

4

In spite of a decades long effort little is known about the magnetic conﬁguration at footpoints of coronal

loops. With the advance of solar instrumentation it becomes evident that coronal loops are often rooted in

a mixed polarity and dynamic ﬁelds this is in stark contrast to the long prevailing view that plage ﬁelds in

solar ARs are mainly unipolar. Thus, Su et al. (2012) reported that high-speed outﬂows were only observed

in association with mixed polarity ﬁelds observed with Solar Dynamics Observatory’s (SDO) Helioseis-

mic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument. Chitta et al. (2017, 2018) reported that studied coronal loops

were rooted in a small-scale, mixed polarity magnetic environment and argued that ﬂux cancellation and

reconnection low in the solar atmosphere drive mass and energy ﬂows along the loops. Chen et al. (2014)’s

simulations further detail the process on interaction between convection and emerging magnetic ﬂux that

may lead to enhanced heating at footpoints of coronal loops. Earlier, Falconer et al. (2003) proposed that

heating of coronal loops observed in quiet Sun regions may be fueled by “explosions” of granule-scale

sheared magnetic bipoles emerging at the edge of network ﬂux concentrations. Using non linear force-free

ﬁeld extrapolation, Tiwari et al. (2017) found that those loops connecting to plage regions, penumbra of op-

posite polarity sunspot, or to a mixed-polarity ﬂux region are the brightest loops, while the umbra-to-umbra

loops remain mostly invisible. These ﬁndings further emphasize and support the idea that magnetoconvec-

tion and magnetic ﬁeld cancellation may play a vital role in coronal heating.

The UV and X-ray sunspot rooted loops (Foukal 1976) are of particular interest since it is not clear in

this case what mechanism may be responsible for plasma heating and acceleration. Early observations of

umbral loops were mostly performed in X-ray spectral range and therefore they possibly only address hot

loops as deﬁned above, while most of the observed sunspot loops are now classiﬁed as warm and they

appear in UV images. Thus, Sams et al. (1992) used a limited size X-ray data set to argue that no bright

loops were detected rooted in the umbra. Webb & Zirin (1981) reported that “no non-ﬂaring X-ray loops

end in umbra”. Katsukawa & Tsuneta (2005) showed that the cool loops, mostly found rooted in pores and

sunspots are associated with high magnetic ﬁlling factor suggesting that lack of heating could be due to

suppressed magneto-convection in the strong-ﬁeld umbral regions.

Katsukawa (2007) examined footpoint locations using continuum intensity data and found that about half

of the loops were anchored at the umbra-penumbra boundary region, while nearly equal parts of the remain-

5

ing loops were located in umbra and penumbra with the tendency for brighter loops to be predominantly

rooted in umbra. Authors argued that irregularities in the sunspot magnetic ﬁeld introduced by light bridges

(LBs) or sunspot fragmentation (e.g., ??Yurchyshyn et al. 2015) lead to formation of current sheets resulting

in coronal heating. Chitta et al. (2016) analyzed slit-jaw images and spectroscopic data from the Interface

Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS, ?) and did not detect any direct evidence of energy input at a foot-

point of a bright coronal loop rooted at a sunspot. Earlier reports (e.g., Del Zanna 2003; Ugarte-Urra et al.

2009) similarly suggested that activity at other , non-sunspot footpoint of the loop may be the cause of their

enhanced temperature and density.

In this study we focus our effort on footpoints of two warm coronal loops well observed in SDO’s At-

mospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171 ˚A images. Both loops had their one footpoint rooted in (Loop

II) or nearby (Loop I) of a sunspot, while the other one (“remote”) located in an AR plage. Our goal is to

study the dynamic of the underlying magnetic ﬁeld co-spatial with the loop footpoints and co-temporal with

episodes of loop brightening and to determine their possible role in the observed loop brightening. One

of the known difﬁculties related to coronal loop studies is contamination of loop emission by overlapping

emission from other loops and bright UV background as well as insufﬁcient spatial resolution that often

prevents reliable identiﬁcation of loop footpoints and affects loops diagnostics. It was therefore our objec-

tive to select isolated loops that can be reliably traced from one footpoint to another. We also take advantage

of high resolution measurements of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld provided by the Goode Solar Telescope

(GST). The loop observed on 10 May 2016 (Loop I) was connecting an inner part of NOAA AR 12542

occupied by pores with a plage area east of the AR. We analyzed one loop revival episode that took place

between 17:00 UT and 17:30 UT. The loop on 12 Dec 2015 (Loop II) was also observed between 17:00 UT

and 17:30 UT in an extended NOAA AR 12470 connecting the main leading sunspot with a peripheral

plage area east of the sunspot. Both loops were large-scale with the footpoint separation of 172′′ and 140′′,

respectively, and their width ﬂuctuated between 1 and 2 Mm. In Section 2 we describe observational data

and in Section 3 we present results for two coronal loops. Conclusions and Discussion are in Section 3.

2. DATA

6

The data in this study were collected using GST TiO broadband imager, Visible Imaging Spectrometer

(VIS, Cao et al. 2010) and Near-Infra-Red Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS, Cao et al. 2012) as well

as Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) and the Atmospheric

Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) instruments on board of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO,

Pesnell et al. 2012).

Photospheric TiO images were acquired every 15 s using a 10 ˚A bandpass TiO ﬁlter centered at 7057 ˚A

with the pixel scale of 0′′.0375. The VIS combines a 5 ˚A interference pre-ﬁlter with a Fabry-P´erot etalon to

produce a band pass of 0.07 ˚A over a round 70′′ wide ﬁeld of view (FOV). The pixel scale is 0′′.029. The

difference in the acquisition time at two sequential line positions (e.g, +0.8 ˚A and -0.8 ˚A) was about 2 s. All

images were acquired with the aid of an adaptive optics (AO) system, which incorporates a 357 actuator de-

formable mirror, a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with 308 sub-apertures, and a digital signal processor

system (Zhang et al. 2014). All TiO and VIS data were speckle reconstructed with the Kiepenheuer-Institut

f¨ur Sonnenphysik’s software package (KISIP, W¨oger & von der L¨uhe 2007) to achieve the diffraction limit

of the telescope (0′′.1) over a large FOV.

The NIRIS vector magnetic ﬁeld data was acquired using AO corrected light, a dual Fabry-P´erot etalon

and a 2k × 2k HgCdTe Helium cooled Teledyne camera. Two polarization states are simultaneously imaged

side-by-side on a 1024 × 1024 pixel area each, using a dual beam system that provides a 85′′ round FOV

with image scale of 0′′.083/pixel. The measurements were performed using the Fe I 15650 ˚A doublet with

a bandpass of 0.1 ˚A and a rotating 0.35λ wave plate that allowed us to sample 16 phase angles at each of

more than 60 line positions at a cadence of 30 s per one full spectroscopic measurement (full-Stokes I, Q,

U, V). The Fe I 15650 ˚A Stokes data were corrected for polarization effect and inverted using a Milne-

Eddington (ME) inversion approach adopted for NIRIS data. This inversion code was written by J. Chae

(private communication) using the fomulae given in Landi Degl’Innocenti et al. (1992). Its early version

was previously applied to the Hinode/SP data by Chae et al. (2009). The code sets the ﬁlling factor/stray

light fraction parameter to unity, which is because magnetic structures are believed to be fully resolved

in these data. An inverted data set includes nine parameters among which are the total magnetic ﬁeld

7

strength, inclination and azimuth angles, and the Doppler shift. For ME code performance comparison, see

Borrero et al. (2014).

The SDO/AIA instrument acquires full disk EUV images of the Sun (FOV ∼1.3 R⊙) with a spatial reso-

lution of 1′′.5 (0′′.6 per pixel) and a cadence of 12 s. In this study, we relayed on 171 ˚A (Fe IX, T ≈0.7 MK)

data since these images were less populated by loops at various temperatures and densities which allowed

us to reliably identify loop footpoints. To determine coronal temperatures and emission measure (EM) we

utilized data from six AIA channels: 94 ˚A (Fe XVIII, T ≈6.3 MK), 131 ˚A (Fe VIII, Fe XXI, Fe XXIII,

i.e., 0.4, 10, 16 MK), 171 ˚A (Fe IX,T ≈0.7 MK), 211 ˚A (Fe XIV, T ≈2 MK), 193 ˚A (Fe XII, Fe XXIV,

T ≈1.5, 20 MK) and 335 ˚A (Fe XVI, T ≈2.5 MK). To analyse magnetic ﬁelds at the footpoints we also

used HMI hmi.B 720s series data, which are HMI full-disk VFISV ME inverted and disambiguated vector

ﬁeld observations (Hoeksema et al. 2014; Hayashi et al. 2015).

3. RESULTS

3.1. 10 May 2016 Loop

The May 10 loop seen in the left panel of Figure 1 and the online movie showed two revival episodes

taking place between 16:40 UT and 17:30 UT. The remote loop foot-point was situated in a positive polarity

plage (vertical arrow), while the other foot-point was anchored in a sunspot-adjacent area riddled with small

pores (cross-hair). The ﬁrst episode began at 16:40 UT and peaked by approx 16:50 UT, when the entire

loop became visible in AIA 171 ˚A images. The loop intensity soon rapidly decreased only to revive again at

17:05 UT and it became well deﬁned and traceable from one footpoint to another by 17:20 UT. During this

15 min interval the 171 ˚A sunspot footpoint brightened and the sunspot adjacent half of the loop appeared

brighter and extending as well, giving the impression of solar plasma being injected into the loop at that

footpoint. In Figure 2 we show snapshots of a straightened loop as it evolved. We straightened loops by

stacking 6′′wide image slices cut at every pixel along the spine of the loop in the direction orthogonal to

the local tangential of the loop. In each panel, the green vertical dashed line marks the initial position of a

loop leg at the onset of the event, while the arrows indicate the subsequent displacements of that leg. As the

loop evolved the displaced leg soon appeared detached by ∼ 2 Mm from the bright AIA 171 ˚A footpoint

8

(shifted away from the vertical line) and instead a bright ∼20 Mm jet like feature appeared at that location

(panel 24:10). The observed loop displacement and the new jet feature are consistent with an continuous

interchange type of reconnection where an open ﬁeld line may “jump” over a dipole that emerges next to it

(e.g., Crooker et al. 2002; Cranmer & van Ballegooijen 2010; Kong et al. 2018).

To determine differential emission measure (DEM) distribution of an AR, we used the automatic DEM

code developed by Aschwanden et al. (2013). The code ﬁrst co-aligns near simultaneous images from six

AIA channels and then calculates the Gaussian DEM distribution with best-ﬁt values for the peak emission

measure, peak temperature, and Gaussian temperature widths in each pixel. In Figure 3 we show emission

measure, log EM, and peak temperature, log T [K], maps calculated near the peak of the loop evolution

(17:16 UT). Although the thermal image of the right (sunspot) half of the loop is diffuse, the log T map

shows that the loop temperature was nearly uniform in the 1.0-1.5 MK range that put it in the class of warm

loop (Lenz 1999; Del Zanna 2003).

We analyzed AIA 94, 131, 211, 193, 171, 335 ˚A images to understand heating and cooling processes in the

loop and to determine the temporal delay in the peak intensities among different channels (Viall & Klimchuk

2011). In Figure 4 we plot AIA intensity proﬁles measured near the loop apex within the boxed area shown

in Figure 1. The proﬁles were normalized relative to the minimal intensity detected during the time

interval of interest. To probe intensity variations within the loop we tested several locations and

chose the part of the loop that was not affected by the background emission. Moreover, this part

was also free from the long lasting foot-point emission, which allowed us to detect subtle emission

variations associated with propagation of plasma along the loop. The AIA 131 ˚A channel (cyan) shows

a nearly steady proﬁle until about 17:09 UT when a small enhancement occurred that peaked at approxi-

mately 17:18 UT and consisted of numerous weak impulsive events. The AIA 171 ˚A proﬁle (double black)

generally agrees with the AIA 131 ˚A since it represents contributions from both cool and hot temperature

plasma. The AIA 211 ˚A proﬁle (purple line) is also similar to the above two proﬁles in that it peaks near

17:18 UT although the ﬁne scale structure of the proﬁle is different. To the contrary, the 193 ˚A proﬁle (gold)

behaves quite differently exhibiting an decreasing trend during the peak times 17:18-17:24 UT) in the hotter

channels. We also note that the plasma ﬂow pattern observed in the AIA 211, 193, and 131 ˚A was quite

9

similar to that seen in the 171 ˚A channel (i.e., from one footpoint to the other). The loop and plasma ﬂows

were not detected in the hot AIA 94 and 335 ˚A channels.

The time lag in various UV light curves and its magnitude are important for understanding the physical

processes behind the loop heating and cooling episodes. In case of a single heating event, the heated plasma

is ﬁrst expected to be detected in hotter UV spectral lines such as 131 ˚A or 211 ˚A and, as the plasma cools,

the loop may become visible in progressively cooler lines such as 171 ˚A (see e.g., Viall & Klimchuk 2011).

When several consecutive heating events occur at a time interval that is much shorter than the plasma cooling

time, then the time lag between the cool and hot channels is less pronounced (if at all present) since the loop

may be reheated again as it cools. In this case the heating is considered to be steady and the emission is

thought to be hot so that the cooling sequence mentioned above may not be observed. The studied event

does not show a well deﬁned time lag and appears to be relevant to the idea of a steady heating process.

In Figure 5 we show the photosphere and lower chromosphere associated with the loop sunspot footpoint.

The footpoint position, seen as a bright AIA 171 ˚A patch, is outlined in these panels by the ellipse. Co-

alignment of GST and SDO data showed that it was associated with negative polarity elements N1 and N4 as

well as a positive polarity ﬁelds P1. Note that the NIRIS observations began at 17:14 UT. According to TiO

images, the P1 element was moving toward N4 and it was part of a new ﬂux emergence that began at least

at 17:09 UT. It also created a footprint in photospheric TiO images seen as a faint dimmer “indentation”

atop of a granule with a brighter round feature in the middle (seen on the left of the letter “P”). Co-temporal

GST/VIS images did not show any distinct jetting that could be reliably linked to the ﬂux emergence event

besides possibly faint narrow blue-shifted jets seen between “P1” and “N1” in the GST/VIS Hα-0.8 ˚A im-

age. In Figure 6 we show evolution of the GST/NIRIS vector magnetic ﬁelds associated with the sunspot

footpoint. According to the data, N1 and P1 were magnetically connected with the transverse ﬁelds running

along the P1-N1 line. As the ﬂux emergence progressed, P1 shifted toward N4 and the N1 ﬂux increased.

However, by 17:30 UT the transverse ﬁelds connecting the N1-P1 pair seem to have weakened, while the

P1-N4 connection has strengthened as evidenced by the transverse ﬁelds that now became oriented along

the line connecting the elements. This orientation change as well as weakening of P1 both suggest that we

10

witnessed a ﬂux cancellation process driven by emergence of small-scale ﬁelds at the borderline of mostly

unipolar plage ﬁelds.

Figure 7 shows evolution of HMI LOS ﬁelds at the remote footpoint of Loop I (arrow in Figure 1).

Comparison of 16:39:45, 17:03:45 and 17:23:15 UT panels suggests that a positive polarity ﬁeld (enclosed

by the white box) has notably increased during that period. We should note that during the analyzed time

interval the remote footpoint did not show any detectable AIA 171 ˚A brightening variations. Considering

that other magnetic elements remained mostly unchanged and there are no signs of magnetic elements being

displaced by convective plasma ﬂows, we are inclined to interpret the positive polarity increase as a result

of ﬂux emergence rather than ﬁeld enhancement due to converging ﬂows. The blue line in Figure 8 is a

5-point smoothed version of the averaged positive LOS ﬂux (thick black line) calculated over the entire

FOV shown in Figure 7 and it is evident that beginning 16:40 UT the ﬂux experienced a rapid 12% increase.

The negative ﬂux in this area did not show any regular trend and was negligible to be shown in the plot. In

order to estimate errors we ﬁrst determined ﬂux time proﬁles for nine different positions of the bounding

box, which was sequentially shifted by one pixel in various directions. Their average proﬁle is plotted in

Figure 8. The resulting proﬁles (gray thin lines) had a very similar structure, however their mean values

were quite different due to the fact that some ﬂux was entering or leaving the box as it shifted. While this

edge ﬂux did not affect the time variations, variations of the mean were too large to directly estimate the

errors, so we subtracted the respective mean from each of nine proﬁles and then calculated the r.m.s. using

the residual (detrended) proﬁles. Thus, the small error bars indicate the stability of these individual time

proﬁles rather than the absolute scatter of the data points induced by the edge effect.

In order to further argue for the ﬂux emergence idea we refer to the fact that nearly always one polarity in

the emerging ﬂux is compact and much stronger than the other one (e.g., McIntosh et al. 1981; Lites et al.

1998; Schmieder et al. 2004; Yurchyshyn et al. 2010; van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015; Chen et al. 2017).

In this case the emerging minor (relative to the positive polarity plage) negative polarity may have been

scattered and thus largely below the detection limit of the HMI instrument. Additionally, it could have

partially cancelled with the surrounding positive polarity ﬁelds as it was emerging, which would further

contributed to the deﬁcit of the negative ﬂux.

11

To summarize, the analyzed data showed notable magnetic activity at both footpoints of this loop con-

sistent with the ﬂux emergence, though solid observational evidence of ﬂux cancellation exist only for the

brighter sunspot footpoint. If the loop indeed was ﬁlled with plasma evaporated by reconnection driven by

the new ﬂux emergence at the sunspot end of the loop that began shortly before 17:09 UT, then we estimate

that the density enhancement propagated along the loop at a rate of ∼ 110 km s−1, accepting that loop

brightness at y=90 Mm (loop midpoint, Figure 2) enhanced at approx 17:18 UT. This estimate is some-

what higher than the 40-60 km s−1 rate reported from spectroscopic observations (Winebarger et al. 2002;

Tripathi et al. 2009; Sadykov et al. 2015) and is consistent with Ofman & Wang (2008) measurements.

3.2. 17 Dec 2015 Loop

Loop II was connecting a plage region with an outer umbral region of the main leading sunspot in NOAA

AR 12470 (Figure 9 and online movie), which was an ALMA campaign target (Shimojo et al. 2017). Al-

though GST observations did cover the leading sunspot we do not use them here because of unsatisfactory

seeing quality. Loop II is similar to Loop I in size and life time, however, one notable and intended differ-

ence is that its sunspot footpoint was rooted in the umbra as opposed to a near-sunspot area as in case of

Loop I. Also, while Loop I was apparently ﬁlled with plasma nearly simultaneously along the entire length

(possibly because plasma injection occurred at both footpoints), Loop II showed propagation of a dense

plasma front from the remote footpoint toward the sunspot (Figure 10, arrows). This ﬂow pattern is consis-

tent with the idea of energy release occurring at one of the footpoints of the loop which injects hot plasma

into the loop and it further travels the other footpoint of the loop. It has been reported that such energy

release events at loop footpoint not only lead to rapid heating but also trigger a longitudinal compressive

wave along the loop, which may bounce back and forth several times before fading (Kumar et al. 2013,

2015).

Figure 13 shows AIA intensity proﬁles determined close to the endpoint of the loop (see boxed area in

Figure 9). The loop has experienced several revival episodes as well. The ﬁrst episode occurred after

16:00 UT with the peak 211 ˚A intensity (purple) at 16:20 UT. The 193 ˚Aand 171 ˚A proﬁles peaked at

16:20 and 16:30 UT, correspondingly, resulting in about a 10 min time lag, which is consistent with an

impulsive heating event. Shortly after that all AIA proﬁles showed a steady increase with small-scale details

12

suggesting multiple energy injection events. The time interval considered here is marked with two vertical

dotted lines. According to the ﬁgure, by 17:10 UT the 193 ˚A the intensity (gold) have reached a turning

point at which it slightly decreased and then continued to grow but already at a different rate (compare

16:55-17:10 and 17:10-17:20 UT intervals) until 17:20 UT, followed by intensity decrease till 17:40 UT. At

the same time, the 171 ˚A intensity gradually increased and it peaked at 17:45 UT. Note that during this time

interval all curves showed a steady growth without any pronounced time lag in their proﬁles.

Figure 11 displays loop intensity proﬁles at four positions along the loop. The intensity proﬁle measured

at the loop footpoint (black) shows an increase at 17:07 UT, which coincides with the peak of the negative

HMI ﬂux (Figure 14) and suggests that ﬂux cancellation began about 10 min after the onset of the emergence

process. The footpoint intensity returned to the pre-event level at 17:22 UT, the time when the negative ﬂux

completely diminished and the injected plasma reached the sunspot footpoint. At the same time all AIA

proﬁles began to decline as well (Figure 13). The loop intensity at the sunspot footpoint peaked at 17:37 UT

after which it began to decrease. The 171 ˚A emitting plasma began to appear at about 17:10 UT at the remote

footpoint at y=40 Mm (Figure 10) and reached position of y=110 Mm along the loop by ∼ 17:25 UT, which

resulted in a 80 km s−1 rate, which is in agreement with that derived for Loop I. The green and blue curves

show intensity variations at y=40 Mm and y=110 Mm, correspondingly. Although intensity at y=110 Mm

was gradually increasing (blue curve), only at t=25 min it became possible to clearly identify the loop.

In Figure 12 we show log EM and log T [K] maps calculated for Loop II at 17:33 UT. Unlike the Loop

I case, only “remote” half of the loop exhibited enhanced temperatures of (1.0 − 1.5 MK) and log EM,

which too may be classiﬁed as a warm loop (Lenz 1999; Del Zanna 2003). The sunspot footpoint was

located in a large sunspot with its umbra partially fragmented by several thin LBs, however, it was not

anchored at an LB but in an outer uniform umbral area. Although seeing quality of GST data collected at

that time was not very good, neither these data nor AIA images showed any signatures of jetting at that

umbral location. Available IRIS data also did not indicate any activity at that footpoint as well. Note, that

IRIS began to observe this sunspot at 17:33 UT as a part of ALMA campaign. Moreover, we could not

ﬁnd traces of the loop in any of the available IRIS data, which makes this case quite different from the one

13

described in Chitta et al. (2016). This led us to conclude that the remote footpoint was responsible for the

observed revival of the loop.

Evolution of HMI LOS ﬁelds at the remote loop footpoint is shown in Figure 14. The loop was rooted

at the center of the FOV where a small positive polarity element, outlined by a black contour in the

17:13:08 UT panel, gradually diminished. The graphs on the right quantify the ﬁeld evolution by show-

ing that the positive ﬂux (blue) increased by about 20% (0.4×1019 Mx) during a 20 min time interval.

The HMI data also showed very weak signatures of opposite polarity ﬂux (small white contour in center

of the 17:13:08 UT panel) appearing next to the positive polarity element. The negative ﬂux appeared at

∼17:10 UT and peaked at 1.5×1016 Mx level at 17:15 UT, which nearly coincides with the onset of plasma

injection (Figure 10). Shortly after that the negative ﬂux disappeared from the FOV. Although very little

details on magnetic ﬁelds evolution are available to us, the HMI data nevertheless do suggest that ﬂux emer-

gence and cancellation took place at the footpoint of the loop thus possibly causing the plasma injection.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this study we focused on the magnetic environment at four footpoints of two coronal loops and con-

cluded that magnetic ﬂux emergence and cancellation have driven plasma and energy injection into the

loops. Loop I was connecting a remote plage area with the core of an AR populated with numerous pores.

It appeared to be ﬁlled with plasma uniformly and simultaneously along its entire length. GST NIRIS and

HMI data showed that there was non-negligible magnetic activity at both their footpoints located at the

boundary of seemingly unipolar vast of magnetic ﬁelds, where magnetic dynamics is expected to be high.

High-resolution NIRIS vector magnetograms showed emergence of a small (∼1 Mm) bipole with strong

transverse ﬁelds, while HMI data only registered an enhancement of the dominant positive polarity. Loop

II was spanning nearly entire AR connecting a plage area with the sunspot umbra. The plasma was injected

at the remote plage footpoint and this footpoint also showed considerable variations in the HMI magne-

tograms. In particular, HMI observations registered appearance of opposite polarity ﬁelds several minutes

prior to the plasma ﬂow onset. The sunspot footpoint did not exhibit neither magnetic nor plasma activ-

ity. We thus suggest that the loop activation, plasma ﬂows and heating processes were driven by magnetic

reconnection between a small-scale emerging ﬂux and large-scale ﬁelds. In this type of conﬁguration the

14

large scale ﬁeld line “jumps” across a dipole, which may correspond to the the loop displacement clearly

observed in the AIA 171 ˚A data. We also conclude that the sunspot rooted bright loops may be caused not

only by LB and umbral dots activity (e.g., ?Tian et al. 2018) but also by the photospheric dynamics at the

remote (non-sunspot) footpoint.

In spite of the fact that there is a substantial body of literature devoted to coronal loop studies, very few

publications were addressing the magnetic structure of loop footpoints. Until very recently magnetic ﬁeld

measurements were dominated by SOHO/MDI, SDO/HMI, and Hinode/SOT instruments and several stud-

ies based on these data (e.g., Del Zanna 2003; Ugarte-Urra et al. 2009) reported that coronal loops are often

connected to highly dynamic but nevertheless unipolar plage ﬁelds. However, recently Wang (2016) argued

that HMI instrument does not resolve many small-scale structures so, that mixed polarity may be present

below the resolution limit. Also, Abramenko et al. (2009) showed that at spatial scales below 2 Mm are

highly intermittent and burst-like energy release events are possible. Brooks et al. (2010) concluded that

changes in the underlying unipolar magnetic ﬁelds could account for heating of warm loops but they are not

strong enough to provide energy needed for hot loops. Ji et al. (2012); Zeng et al. (2013) and Hong et al.

(2017) used 10830 ˚A data to conclude that energy for heating the upper solar atmosphere comes from

inter-granular lanes. These ﬁndings are well aligned with Wiegelmann et al. (2010) who found that one of

the footpoints of quiet Sun coronal loops is often found inside the dynamic inter-network magnetic ﬁelds.

Using a similar approach Tiwari et al. (2017) also argued that coronal heating may be fueled by vigorous

magneto-convection which can braid magnetic ﬁeld lines and that the heating rate is directly dependent on

the ﬁeld strength in the loop. However, strong ﬁelds, such as those found in the sunspot umbra suppress

magnetoconvection thus reducing the heating rate (e.g., Chen et al. 2014; Tiwari et al. 2017). Chitta et al.

(2017, 2018) further noted that some bright AR loops are rooted in mixed polarity areas, while Tiwari et al.

(2017) suggested that interaction of opposite polarity ﬁelds may supply additional energy, in excess of that

generated by loop braiding. Although the idea that the mixed polarity ﬁelds may play a role in coronal

heating has been discussed for a while, the novelty of our study is that we were able to link a single ﬂux

emergence event to an isolated loop heating episode and to study the structure of the vector ﬁeld associ-

ated with the emerging element. Recently Goˇsi´c et al. (2018) used IRIS data to show that such magnetic

15

cancellations may produce a clear signature of heating in the upper atmosphere, while Priest et al. (2018)

estimated parameters of three-dimensional reconnection driven by photospheric ﬂux cancellation.

Falconer et al. (2003) proposed that heating of quiet Sun coronal loops may be fueled by “explo-

sions” of granule-scale sheared magnetic bipoles emerging at the edge of network ﬂux concentrations.

Schmieder et al. (2004) compared UV TRACE and SXT Yohkoh loops and concluded that cooler UV loops

were mainly heated at their footpoints. Aschwanden et al. (2007) argued that heating occurs in the TR and

the chromosphere and is due to photospheric rather than coronal magnetic complexity. Su et al. (2012) stud-

ied magnetic ﬁeld evolution at the footpoints of two loops using SDO/HMI data. High-speed outﬂows were

observed in one loop where HMI data showed strong presence of mixed polarity ﬁelds at its footpoints. An-

other analyzed loop did not exhibit any detectable outﬂows but remained visible during nearly four hours,

which signiﬁcantly exceeds the estimated 65 min cooling time for a 200 Mm long loop (Brooks et al. 2010).

What was the source of energy that ensured the loop visibility over a several hour period? Similarly to the

case considered here, these authors did report a gradual increase of positive polarity ﬂux at the loop foot-

point, which may indicate varying magnetic ﬁelds. Reviewing the published data we also found that this

loop was rooted at the edge of a network ﬂux cluster, so that the scenario suggested by Falconer et al. (2003)

could be realized there. This is also similar to the two cases presented here. It is well known even since the

pre-Hinode era that there are strong small-scale magnetic ﬁelds present in the granulation and associated

with clusters of photospheric bright points (e.g., De Pontieu 2002; Lites et al. 2008, and references therein).

These ﬁelds could carry enough energy for coronal heating as reported in Song et al. (2015). Rempel (2014)

arrived to the same conclusion using data from numerical simulations. Using line-of-sight data from IMeX

instrument (Mart´ınez-Pillet et al. 2011) on the SUNRISE balloon (Solanki et al. 2010), Chitta et al. (2017)

found small-scale mixed polarity magnetic ﬁelds at the footpoints of studied coronal loops and argued that

ﬂux cancellation and reconnection low in the solar atmosphere drive mass and energy ﬂows along the loops.

One of the loops studied here was rooted in a sunspot umbra away from a LB. It was gradually ﬁlled with

plasma starting from the remote plage footpoint. Chitta et al. (2016) discussed a case of a bright coronal

loop with strong supersonic downﬂows rooted in a sunspot without LBs. We also note a difference between

our and Chitta et al. (2016) cases: while these authors were able to measure physical properties of the loop

16

plasma using IRIS data, our loop was not visible in IRIS spectral lines, which indicates that its was generally

hotter than the Chitta et al. (2016) loop. Earlier, Straus et al. (2015) reported a case when a loop with

supersonic downﬂows was not detectable in chromospheric lines, suggesting that sunspot rooted loops may

exhibit various temperature and ﬂow modes that sill need to be understood. Chitta et al. (2016) speculated

that a siphon ﬂow generated by asymmetric heating at the other (unobserved in this case) footpoint may

be the cause. We were able to trace the loop and locate its remote footpoint, which allowed us to identify

small-scale magnetic activity in the photosphere. Based on HMI measurements and NIRIS data for Loop I

we argue that small-scale (∼1 Mm) ﬂux emergence and cancellations have likely caused plasma injection

into the loop via heating and evaporation, thus representing the asymmetric heating needed to drive siphon

ﬂows discussed in Chitta et al. (2016).

Finally, the remote footpoints of both loops studies here were located at the edge of a plage region and,

according to HMI data, they where rooted at or near small ﬂux concentrations.

It is known that small

clusters of plage ﬁelds are associated with type II spicules (de Pontieu et al. 2007), and it was later argued

(De Pontieu et al. 2009, 2011) that they may contribute to coronal heating as well. Yurchyshyn et al. (2013)

analyzed NIRIS magnetic ﬁeld data associated with a cluster of photospheric BPs and spicules of type II and

reported that opposite polarity ﬁelds constantly appear in very close proximity to the cluster and the episodes

of new ﬂux emergence are connected to enhanced production of type II spicules.Mart´ınez-Sykora et al.

(2017) simulations of type II spicules further emphasized importance of emerging small-scale magnetic

ﬁelds for their origin. Therefore, it is likely that magnetic reconnection and type II spicules are at the origin

of warm coronal loops and further high resolution observations of loop footpoints in the photosphere and

chromosphere are needed to shed more light on their structure.

The present study as well as earlier studies further show that on spatial scales below 2 Mm magnetic

ﬁelds are still dynamic and complex, which may directly manifest itself in the solar corona through chro-

mospheric and TR heating of coronal loops. X-ray ﬂares in quiet Sun areas have recently been detected

with Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR, Kuhar et al. 2018; Marsh et al. 2018), which once

again emphasizes that the magnetic structures hidden below the resolution of modern instrumentation have

to be taken into account when considering mechanisms of coronal heating.

Figure 1. AIA 171 ˚A (left) and HMI line-of-sight (right) images acquired at 17:15 UT on 10 May 2016. The arrow
(-97′′,225′′) and the cross-hairs (92′′,238′′) mark the position of the remote and the sunspot footpoint of a ﬁne active

loop. An animation of the AIA 171 ˚A images is available in the online Journal. The animation runs from 16:50

to 17:30 UT and includes white arrows marking the positions of the remote and the sunspot footpoint of a ﬁne

active loop.

Figure 2. Evolution of the AIA 171 ˚A loop between 16:56:10 UT and 17:30:10 UT on 10 May 2016. The title above

each panel indicates the acquisition time (MM:SS, no hours) of the corresponding image. The lower end of the loop

at y=3 Mm is the sunspot footpoint (west), while the remote plage footpoint (east) is at y=175 Mm. The green dotted

line segments mark the position of the loop as measured at 16:56:10 UT. The black arrows point to the current position

of the loop which was gradually shifting to the right (south). The two green arrows indicate the evolving foot of the

loop discussed in the text.

Figure 5. Chromospheric VIS Hα−0.8 ˚A and Hα+0.8 ˚A images (two left panels), photospheric TiO 7059 ˚A image, and

NIRIS B line-of-sight component of the magnetic ﬁeld (right) in the vicinity of the AIA 171 ˚A sunspot loop footpoint,

location of which is outlined by the ellipse. “N1” and “N4” mark two negative polarity magnetic elements and the co-

spatial compact brightenings, while “P1” marks a small positive polarity ﬂux that situated in the middle of a granule.
“N2”, “N3”, and “△” are plotted here to ease image comparison. The FOV of each panels is 17′′.4×17′′.4 Mm.

Figure 6. Evolution of the magnetic environment at the sunspot footpoint of the loop. The black arrow represents 2000

G transverse ﬁelds. The LOS ﬁelds (background) are scaled between -200 G (red) and 200 G (blue). “N1”, “P1”,

and “N4” mark position of magnetic elements under discussion. The extended AIA 171 ˚A sunspot loop footpoint

occupied space between N1 and N4 (also see Fig. 5).

26

Figure 7. Evolution of HMI.M 45s series magnetic ﬁelds at the remote footpoint of Loop I. The footpoint location is

enclosed by the box. Only the positive (white) ﬁelds inside the box, showed considerable variations between 16:39 UT

and 17:23 UT, while the rest of the features remained in a nearly stable state.

Figure 8. Time variations of the positive ﬂux calculated over the entire FOV shown in Fig. 7. Thin gray lines show

ﬂux calculated separately for 9 positions of the bounding box. The thick black line show the corresponding averaged

proﬁle, while the blue line is the smoothed averaged proﬁle. For error bars calculations see text. The red closed circles

on the blue curve indicate times of the panels in Fig. 7.

Figure 14. Evolution of the photospheric HMI.M 45s series magnetic ﬁelds at the remote footpoint of Loop II. Black

contours are drawn at 100 and 500 G levels, while the white contours are plotted at the 5 G level. The units shown on
the x-axis in the third panel are HMI pixels. The ﬁeld of view is 19×16 pixels, which corresponds to 6.9 × 5.8 Mm.

The right panel shows time proﬁles of the positive (blue) and negative (red) ﬂux calculated over the entire FOV. The

red closed circles on the time proﬁles indicate times of the panels.
