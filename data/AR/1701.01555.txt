ABSTRACT
The Sunrise balloon-borne solar observatory, consisting of a 1 m aperture telescope that provided
a stabilized image to a UV ﬁlter imager and an imaging vector polarimeter, carried out its second
science ﬂight in June 2013. It provided observations of parts of active regions at high spatial resolution,
including the ﬁrst high-resolution images in the Mg ii k line. The obtained data are of very high quality,
with the best UV images reaching the diﬀraction limit of the telescope at 3000 ˚A after Multi-Frame
Blind Deconvolution reconstruction accounting for phase-diversity information. Here a brief update
is given of the instruments and the data reduction techniques, which includes an inversion of the
polarimetric data. Mainly those aspects that evolved compared with the ﬁrst ﬂight are described.
A tabular overview of the observations is given.
In addition, an example time series of a part of
the emerging active region NOAA AR 11768 observed relatively close to disk centre is described
and discussed in some detail. The observations cover the pores in the trailing polarity of the active
region, as well as the polarity inversion line where ﬂux emergence was ongoing and a small ﬂare-like
brightening occurred in the course of the time series. The pores are found to contain magnetic ﬁeld
strengths ranging up to 2500 G and, while large pores are clearly darker and cooler than the quiet
Sun in all layers of the photosphere, the temperature and brightness of small pores approach or even
exceed those of the quiet Sun in the upper photosphere.

1. INTRODUCTION

Probing the Sun at high resolution has time and again
revealed new phenomena not previously seen. Examples
are the discovery of umbral dots by Beckers and Schr¨oter
(1968), facular bright points by Mehltretter (1974), dark
cores in penumbral ﬁlaments by Scharmer et al. (2002),
lateral downﬂows in penumbral ﬁlaments by Joshi et al.
(2011a,b); Scharmer et al. (2011), or the ultraﬁne loops
reported by Ji et al. (2012).

In spite of the signiﬁcant advances made in ground-

based observations, it remains challenging to accurately
take into account or fully remove the eﬀects of atmo-
spheric seeing from observational data.
In addition,
high-resolution studies from the ground are generally
limited to wavelengths with high photon ﬂux and usu-
ally to short periods of stable seeing. Thus, in spite
of having an aperture smaller than that of the largest
ground-based telescopes, the space-based Solar Optical
Telescope onboard Hinode (Tsuneta et al. 2008) has re-
sulted in many advances. These include the discovery

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

of penumbral microjets (Katsukawa et al. 2007), waves
carrying copious amounts of energy along spicules (De
Pontieu et al. 2007), ubiquitous linear-polarisation sig-
nals in the quiet Sun (Orozco Su´arez et al. 2007; Lites
et al. 2008; Lagg et al. 2016), or very fast downﬂows at
the ends of particular penumbral ﬁlaments (van Noort
et al. 2013). Hence, an even larger solar telescope lo-
cated above the bulk of the Earth’s atmosphere has an
extensive discovery space.

The largest solar telescope (along with the Soviet
stratospheric solar observatory; Krat et al. 1974) to have
reached the near-space conditions of the stratosphere is
Sunrise, which had a very successful ﬁrst ﬂight in June
2009 (for an overview of earlier balloon-borne solar tele-
scopes and results see Solanki et al. 2010). The data
obtained during that ﬁrst ﬂight of Sunrise has led to
the following discoveries and insights, among many other
results:

• First ever spatially resolved images of small-scale
intense magnetic ﬂux concentrations in the quiet
Sun show that semi-empirical ﬂux tube models
provide a reasonable description of such structures
(Lagg et al. 2010).

• First ever brightness measurements of ﬂux con-
centrations in the UV at 312 nm, 300 nm and 214
nm reveal very high intensities, up to a factor of
5 above the mean quiet-Sun brightness at 214 nm
(Riethm¨uller et al. 2010).

• First ever measurements of the RMS intensity con-
trast of granulation in the UV show high values of
up to 30%, consistent with numerical simulations.
These values provide a direct measure of the eﬃ-
ciency of convective energy transport by granula-
tion (Hirzberger et al. 2010).

• The most sensitive high-resolution time sequences
of maps of the vector magnetic ﬁeld ever obtained
reveal abundant, short-lived and highly dynamic
small-scale horizontal ﬁelds (Danilovic et al. 2010).

• Ubiquitous small-scale whirl ﬂows are found which
drag small-scale magnetic ﬁeld structures into
their centres (Bonet et al. 2010).

• Magnetic

ﬁeld

extrapolations

from Sun-
rise/IMaX data indicate that most magnetic
loops in the quiet Sun remain within the pho-
fraction reaches the
tosphere. Only a small
chromosphere. Most of these higher-lying loops
are anchored (at least in one foot point) in the
strong-ﬁeld elements of the network (Wiegelmann
et al. 2010).

• Discovery of large amplitude acoustic waves in the
quiet solar atmosphere. Such waves were missed in
the past, since they are spatially strongly localized
and their photospheric sources move signiﬁcantly
within a short time (Bello Gonz´alez et al. 2010).

• First detection of horizontally oriented vortex
tubes in solar convective features. Such vortex
tubes were found to be rather common in solar
granules (Steiner et al. 2010).

• Discovery that the internetwork magnetic ele-
ments continuously move back and forth between a
state of weak and strong magnetic ﬁeld (Mart´ınez
Gonz´alez et al. 2011; Requerey et al. 2014).

• First determination of the inclination of magnetic
elements directly from their position in images
sampling diﬀerent heights. The results reveal that
the magnetic elements are nearly vertical, in con-
trast to inversion techniques that suggested that
they were close to horizontal (but in this case were
strongly aﬀected by noise; Jafarzadeh et al. 2014).

• First detection of localized, strongly wavelength-
shifted polarization signals in the quiet Sun that
are interpreted as supersonic upﬂows caused by
magnetic reconnection of emerging small-scale
loops with pre-existing ﬁelds (Borrero et al. 2010),
conﬁrmed by Hinode observations (Mart´ınez Pillet
et al. 2011b).

• Discovery that 85 % of the internetwork magnetic
ﬁelds stronger than 100 G are concentrated in
mesogranular lanes, although there is no particular
mesogranular scale (Yelles Chaouche et al. 2011).

The data taken during the ﬁrst ﬂight of the Sun-
rise observatory were limited to the quiet Sun, as the
Sun was exceedingly quiet for the whole duration of the
ﬂight. To be able to probe an active region with the
unique capabilities of the Sunrise observatory, a re-
ﬂight of the largely (but not completely) unchanged in-
strumentation was carried out in June 2013.
In this
paper we describe the updates of the instruments and
of the data reduction. We also provide an overview of
the obtained data and of the ﬁrst results obtained from
this second ﬂight of Sunrise. A set of results from this
second ﬂight are described in the publications that are
part of this special issue (which also contains some pa-
pers making use of data from the ﬁrst Sunrise science
ﬂight).

In the following we shall often refer to the instrumen-
tation as ﬂown during the ﬁrst ﬂight in 2009 and the
corresponding mission as Sunrise I, while the updated

scribed and an overview of the obtained data is given
in Sect. 4. The updated data reduction procedures are
described in Sect. 5, again focussing on the parts that
changed relative to the ﬁrst ﬂight. Some snapshots of
the reduced data are discussed in Sect. 6. Finally, con-
clusions and an outlook on future plans for Sunrise are
presented in Sect. 7.

2. INSTRUMENTATION UPDATE
Sunrise II is composed of a Gregory telescope with a
main mirror of 1 m diameter and two post-focus instru-
ments located above it, together with the Image Sta-
bilization and Light Distribution unit (ISLiD) and the
Correlating Wavefront Sensor (CWS). The telescope and
instruments are mounted in a gondola hanging under a
zero-pressure balloon. The system is stabilized by the
gondola and a tip-tilt mirror located in ISLiD that is
controlled by the CWS. The post-focus instruments are
the Sunrise Filter Imager (SuFI), that observes in 5
wavelength channels between roughly 2000 and 4000 ˚A,
and a ﬁlter magnetograph, the Imaging Magnetograph
eXperiment (IMaX), observing in the Fe i 5250.2 ˚A spec-
tral line, a Zeeman triplet with a Land´e factor of g = 3.
The complete instrumentation is described in brief by
Solanki et al. (2010) and in greater detail by Barthol et
al. (2011). Further information on ISLiD and on SuFI
is given by Gandorfer et al. (2011), IMaX is described
by Mart´ınez Pillet et al. (2011a) and more information
on the CWS is provided by Berkefeld et al. (2011).

The major components of Sunrise I, such as the gon-
dola, the telescope and the post-focus instrumentation
suﬀered only minor damage during the landing after the
ﬁrst science ﬂight in 2009 and could be reworked and
prepared for a reﬂight with comparatively little eﬀort.
Below we describe the main changes to the hardware
that were made in preparation for the second ﬂight.

2.1. Gondola, telemetry and telescope

Gondola: Structural protective elements on the gon-
dola, such as the crush pad assembly below the core
gondola frame or the front and rear roll cages needed to
be replaced, as they were designed to deform and thus
to take most of the impact energy to protect the rest of
the payload. In addition to such refurbishment, modiﬁ-
cations were implemented to the gondola, as described
below.

The average power consumption during the ﬁrst ﬂight
was much lower than previously estimated, so that the

number of solar cells could be reduced to only 6 pan-
els with 80 SunPower A-300 cells each (from originally
10 panels in 2009). The panels were mechanically re-
arranged, reducing the overall width of the instrument.
This modiﬁcation allowed a pre-installation of the solar
panels in the integration hall before roll-out, saving pre-
cious time on the day of the launch. Additional beneﬁts
are reduced mass and a lower aerodynamic cross section.
The mounting of the electronics racks, carrying all
the instrument computers, pointing system computer
and power distribution units, was modiﬁed for the 2013
ﬂight. Instead of having a 20◦ tilt towards cold sky as in
the previous conﬁguration, the racks were now mounted
vertically and were directly attached to the gondola side
trusses, providing higher overall stiﬀness and reduced
mass. The reduction in thermal eﬃciency of this con-
ﬁguration was seen to be acceptable, as results from the
2009 ﬂight indicated that the size of the radiating sur-
faces are suﬃciently large to dump all dissipated heat at
moderate temperatures even in this slightly less eﬃcient
conﬁguration.

As part of the on-ground testing before ﬂight, a modal
survey test was performed to determine the ﬁrst natural
eigenmodes of the complete instrument. A set of ex-
ternally mounted accelerometers recorded the impulse
and frequency response to an impact on the gondola
structure. It was veriﬁed that the 10 Hz oscillation ob-
served in the pointing data of the 2009 science ﬂight
corresponds to the ﬁrst torsional bending mode of the
gondola core framework. Modiﬁcations of software ﬁl-
ters were then implemented into the pointing system
control loops, preventing excitation of this mode dur-
ing the 2013 ﬂight. Pointing system housekeeping data
taken during the 2013 ﬂight clearly demonstrated their
eﬃciency, as almost no 10 Hz oscillations were present
during the time spent at ﬂoat altitude and in particular
not when pointing at the Sun.

Telemetry: The 2009 ﬂight operations and commis-
sioning were hampered by the early loss of the E-Link
high-speed telemetry provided by ESRANGE,1 which
ceased operation after only a few hours when switching
from one ground station to another. For the rest of the
2009 mission commanding and health status information
was transmitted through a 6 kbit/s TDRSS link, where
TDRSS is the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System,
a NASA network of communication satellites on geosyn-

pean Space Agency). The member states of ESA/EASP today are

chronous orbits and associated ground stations used for
space-to-ground communication. This was found to be
clearly insuﬃcient.

In preparation for the 2013 science ﬂight the Sun-
rise team helped to qualify the Iridium Pilot/OpenPort
system for balloon ﬂights. A dedicated test set-up was
ﬂown on Sept. 28 and Oct. 07, 2011 from Ft. Sumner on
balloons of the Columbia Scientiﬁc Ballooning Facility
(CSBF) of NASA for several hours each, to verify system
integrity during launch, ascent and operational condi-
tions. The bandwidth transmitted to ground was more
than ten times higher than with the TDRSS Omni link.
Sunrise II was one of the ﬁrst scientiﬁc missions to be
supported with this new telemetry system. The antenna
system on top of the gondola was re-arranged to provide
the required 6 ft clearance to the dome-shaped Iridium
transmitter. Sunrise II reached an average data rate
of 100 kbit/s, and downlink of science data continued
even after the payload landed, although the antenna was
partly buried in Canadian soil.

Telescope and structure: The telescope and instru-
mentation needed a thorough cleaning and refurbish-
ment. All mechanisms were disassembled, inspected,
cleaned, lubricated, re-assembled and requaliﬁed. Mo-
tor and gears of the telescope aperture mechanism were
replaced and the mechanism was improved to provide a
more reliable detection of the open or closed position.
Key elements of the carbon-ﬁber based structure were
inspected, strength tested and found to be still fully in-
tact. The thermal subsystem consisting of the heat re-
jection wedge and its radiators needed to be refurbished.
New second surface mirrors were attached. All telescope
mirror coatings were stripped, the mirrors cleaned, their
optical quality interferometrically veriﬁed and recoated.
The secondary mirror needed to be replaced completely,
as the Zerodur mirror substrate was damaged during the
landing and recovery after the 2009 ﬂight. The mirror
was refabricated by the Lytkarino Optical Glass Factory
(LZOS) in Moscow, with a performance identical to the
original one.

The telescope alignment proved to be a challenge, be-
cause a suﬃciently large reference ﬂat mirror provided
by SAGEM for the 2009 ﬂight was not available this
time. Since on the launch site a misalignment of the
telescope was detected (the telescope had been tested
before departure to Kiruna without a 1m reference ﬂat,
making the performance assessment ambiguous), a read-
justment of the M2 position was necessary.

Figure 1 shows two views of the Sunrise II payload
(telescope with instruments and electronics mounted in
the gondola) hanging from the launch crane at the ES-
RANGE balloon launch facility. More details about the
whole system are provided by Barthol et al. (2011).

insulation (MLI) is used to thermally insulate the telescope
and the instruments.
Image (b) shows better the gondola
structure, including front and rear roll cages.

2.2. Post-focus instrumentation

The instrumentation mounted within the Post-Focus
Instrumentation platform (PFI) survived the landing
and recovery in good shape. Some cleaning was nec-
essary, but almost all elements could be re-used. The
PFI was refurbished, but remained technically identical
to the one used during the 2009 ﬂight. The scientiﬁc
instruments were also refurbished and subsequently in-
tegrated and realigned.

ISLiD: The Image Stabilisation and Light Distribu-
tion system (Gandorfer et al. 2011) was not modiﬁed

acteristics, which ensures suﬃcient blocking of longer
wavelength radiation. The 3120 ˚A channel of Sunrise I
was replaced by a combination of a 2795 ˚A ﬁlter with
4.8 ˚A width and two blockers of 300 ˚A and 110 ˚A width,
respectively. This combination of ﬁlters, whose proﬁle
is plotted in Fig. 1 of Riethm¨uller et al. (2013b), is cen-
tred on the Mg ii k line and gets minimal contribution
from the Mg ii h line located in the ﬁlter proﬁle’s wings.
Observations in the Ca ii H line were possible through
two diﬀerent ﬁlters centred at 3968 ˚A. In addition to
the 1.8 ˚A wide ﬁlter already used in Sunrise I, a 1.1 ˚A
wide ﬁlter was available, which provided better isolation
of the contributions from higher atmospheric layers. In
the following, these channels are referred to as the 3968w
(”w” for wide wavelength band) and 3968n (”n” for nar-
row band) channels. The 3880 ˚A channel, which was
used in Sunrise I, was sacriﬁced for this purpose.

IMaX: The

Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment
(Mart´ınez Pillet et al. 2011a) on the 2013 ﬂight was
also very similar to the version ﬂown on Sunrise I, al-
though a number of smaller changes and updates had
been made. The parts replaced included the FPGA
in the proximity electronics, the LiNbO3 etalon, one
of the CCD cameras, the collimator doublet, the liq-
uid crystal variable retarders (LCVRs), the power sup-
ply for the LCVR heaters (the heaters on the Sunrise I
ﬂight did not have enough power to bring the instrument
to its nominal operational temperature) and the phase-
diversity plate (the original broke upon landing after the
Sunrise I ﬂight). Most of these parts were replaced by
nearly identical ones. In addition, the windows of both
CCD cameras were removed in order to avoid fringes
that had been observed during the Sunrise I ﬂight.

3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MISSION
Sunrise II was ﬂown on a zero-pressure stratospheric
long-duration balloon,
launched and operated by the
Columbia Scientiﬁc Ballooning Facility (CSBF). It was
launched on June 12, 2013 at 05:37:53 UT (07:37:53 local
time) from ESRANGE (67.89◦N, 21.10◦E) near Kiruna
in northern Sweden on a cloudy, but perfectly windstill
day. It reached a ﬂoat altitude of 37.1 km after an ascent
lasting approximately 3.5 h. It then drifted westward at
a mean speed of 35.3 km h−1 and at a mean altitude
of roughly 36 km. Compared to Sunrise I it travelled
more to the south and somewhat faster across the At-
lantic and Greenland, so that it reached the peninsula of
Boothia in Northern Canada on June 17, 2013 where the
ﬂight was terminated at 11:49:24 UT. After 122.3 hours
at ﬂoat altitude the balloon was cut oﬀ and the pay-
load descended suspended from a parachute, reaching
the ground at 70.08◦N, 94.42◦W about one hour later. It
landed relatively softly but tipped over forward, so that
the front ring of the telescope and the radiators of the

ing Wavefront Sensor (CWS), showing the 6 sub-apertures

end-to-end optical performance of the combined ISLiD-
IMaX path, an additional plane-parallel plate was in-
troduced into the converging IMaX feed path in front of
the IMaX interface focus. By choosing the inclination
and orientation of this plate, residual astigmatism in
the ISLiD/IMaX path could be minimised. The plate is
coated with high-eﬃciency anti-reﬂective layers on both
sides, which are tuned to be unpolarizing at the selected
angle of incidence.

CWS: The main improvement to the Correlating
Wavefront Sensor (Berkefeld et al. 2011) for the 2013
ﬂight consisted of a second operating mode. By read-
ing out only the two sub-apertures in the center row
(marked red in Fig. 2), the bandwidth could be substan-
tially increased and the residual image jitter decreased.
Table 1 compares the two modes.

Due to the better performance, the two-sub-aperture
mode was used exclusively during the 2013 ﬂight. Fur-
ther software improvements included better data logging
capabilities and much faster focusing after closing the
CWS control loop.

SuFI: The Sunrise Filter Imager (Gandorfer et al.
2011) was changed very little compared to the Sun-
rise I ﬂight. Thus, the mechanical shutter, which had
seen more than 150 000 releases during the 2009 ﬂight,
was replaced. For the SuFI CCD camera a new power
supply unit with very low output noise was developed.
This led to an improvement in signal-to-noise perfor-
mance by a factor of more than ten. In addition, three
of the wavelength ﬁlters were exchanged. The ﬁlter set
for observations in the 2140 ˚A region was replaced by a
combination of two diﬀerent ﬁlters, both of which have
a FWHM of 210 ˚A, but have diﬀerent side band char-

heat rejection wedge thermal control system were dam-
aged. Otherwise very little serious damage was suﬀered.
Figure 3a shows the ﬂight path of Sunrise II overplot-
ted on a map. Also plotted, for comparison purposes,
is the ﬂight path taken by Sunrise I almost exactly 4
years earlier. Figure 3b displays the height proﬁle of the
ﬂight, with the day-night cycles being visible (although
the Sun never quite set on the payload at ﬂoat alti-
tude). Rapid, although usually not very large increases
in height, for instance on June 15 starting at 05:04 UT,
are due to ballast drops. The elevation of the Sun as
visible from Sunrise II is overplotted. Clearly, the pay-
load remained in direct sunlight during the entire ﬂight,
although the Sun was just over the horizon around local
midnight.

Since at ﬂoat altitude the payload was above 99% of
the Earth’s atmosphere, virtually seeing-free observa-
tions were possible all the time. Also, the balloon stayed
above most of the ozone in the Earth’s atmosphere, al-
lowing high-resolution imaging in the UV at 2140 ˚A,
2795 ˚A and 3000 ˚A, although the residual atmosphere
did require excessively long observing times at 2795 ˚A
and, to a smaller extent, at 2140 ˚A.

E-Link worked until June 13, 2013 at 1:05 UT, i.e. un-
til well after commissioning was completed. Two events
occurred after commissioning that impacted the science
operations. 1. The temperature controller of the IMaX
etalon failed on June 12, 2013 at 23:55 UT, although
possibly problems in the communications between IMaX
subsystems was the real reason for the failure.

2. On June 13, 2013 at 7:30 UT, about 23 hours after
the observations had started, the highly reﬂective front
face of the heat rejection wedge — a glued, 0.1 mm thin
second surface mirror — failed. Due to increased ab-
sorption the heat rejection wedge temperature rapidly
increased each time the telescope was pointed at the
Sun, eventually exceeding the temperature sensor mea-
surement range (whose upper limit lay at 130◦ C) within
a number of minutes (the exact number depended some-

what on the time of day). Therefore, all observing se-
quences had to be shorter than this interval after this
incident, with roughly half an hour in between observ-
ing sequences to allow the heat rejection wedge to cool
down again. However, the optical quality of the data
obtained after the failure of the heat rejection wedge
remained the same as before it, as a careful inspection
revealed.

4. OVERVIEW OF THE DATA RECORDED
DURING THE 2013 FLIGHT OF Sunrise

The total length of time over which observations were
made was 122 hours, during which period SuFI recorded
300 GB (60806 images), while IMaX acquired 68 GB of
data (48129 images). During 16% of the total time at
ﬂoat altitude the CWS loop was closed. The longest
time series of SuFI data covers 60 minutes, while the
longest currently reduced IMaX time series lasts approx-
imately 17 min.

SuFI observed in a variety of modes, diﬀering mainly
in the wavelengths sampled. The various modes were
recorded at diﬀerent times of day. Thus the two shorter
wavelengths, at 2140 ˚A and at 2795 ˚A, were only
recorded close to local noon, when the Sun was the high-
est in the Sky and the absorption due to the atmosphere
was minimal. A brief summary of the recorded SuFI
data is given in Tables 2 and 3. The plate scale per
pixel of SuFI depended on the wavelength and was in

but with a ﬁxed oﬀset in the focus direction. This conﬁg-
uration is necessary, since aberrations of the telescope,
although small enough to allow for diﬀraction limited
performance at visible wavelengths, are not negligible at
the much shorter UV wavelengths. The PD technique
in principle allows for the determination and subsequent
removal of these aberrations, provided one of the pair of
images is in or very near focus according to Gonsalves
& Chidlaw (1979); Paxman et al. (1992).

Therefore, after the traditional darkﬁeld and ﬂatﬁeld
corrections, the data were restored using the Multi-
Frame Blind Deconvolution (MFBD) wavefront sensing
code (van Noort et al. 2005), which allows for an arbi-
trary PD term to be present in the data. Due to the
highly non-telecentric conﬁguration of the beam, how-
ever, the image scale of the defocused image was slightly
diﬀerent from the image scale in the focal plane, so that
the inﬂuence of the tip-tilt components of the wavefront
aberrations in the defocused channel diﬀered from that
in the focal plane. This eﬀect was accommodated by
restoring the frames in the “calibration mode” of the
MFBD code, where all ﬁtted wavefront modes are con-
strained to be the same for the two channels, with the
exception of the tip-tilt and focus terms, that are al-
lowed to vary, but with the diﬀerence between the fo-
cus and defocus channels constrained to have the same
value for all PD pairs in the dataset. Due to the rela-
tively low frame rate of the SuFI camera, only four PD
pairs, recorded in approximately twenty seconds, could
be combined to restore each frame, beyond which the
solar evolution started to degrade the result.

Although this method worked well on some of the
data, it did not always restore the data to the same
quality. This is believed to be the result of residual
pointing errors during the relatively long exposure time,
that blurred the image in a way that is not consistent
with the model, which assumes the point spread func-
tion (PSF) to be produced by a single, static wavefront.

A relatively small amount of IMaX data were also
recorded in the L12-6 mode, in which only Stokes I and
V are recorded at 12 wavelength points in the line, with
6 accumluations per wavelength point.

5. DATA REDUCTION

Due to the changes in the instrumentation as well as
the experience gained from Sunrise I, the data were
reduced using a modiﬁed reduction pipeline.

5.1. SuFI

The SuFI data, as on the ﬁrst ﬂight, were acquired in
phase-diversity (PD) mode, i.e., one half of the sensor
was located in the focal plane, while the other half im-
aged the same part of the solar surface as the ﬁrst half,

The azimuthally averaged Fourier power spectrum of the
best frames, however, shows power signiﬁcantly above
the noise ﬂoor, at wave numbers up to 85% of the true
diﬀraction limit of Dtelescope/lambda (DL, see for in-
stance Paxman et al.
(1996)), which is slightly bet-
ter than the criterion of Dtelescope/(1.22λ) proposed by
Rayleigh (1879) and generally adopted for considering
individual features to be resolved.

5.2. IMAX

The reduction applied to the data from the 2009 ﬂight
was explained in detail by Mart´ınez Pillet et al. (2011a).
Consequently, here we focus on changes in the data re-
duction with respect to the reduction of the ﬁrst ﬂight’s
data, necessitated by the replacement of several compo-
nents of IMaX (described in Sect. 2.2). These replace-
ments inﬂuenced various instrumental eﬀects of IMaX
such as the occurrence of fringes, ghost images, and the
instrument’s stray-light behavior.

After the data were corrected for dark current and
ﬂat-ﬁeld eﬀects, residual excess power due to interfer-
ence fringes was ﬁltered out in the Fourier domain. Be-
fore and after each observing run during the ﬂight, a PD
measurement was obtained by inserting a glass plate into
the optical path of the ﬁrst camera in order to record
pairs of defocussed and focussed images, which then al-
lowed retrieving the system’s PSF. The observational
data were reconstructed by applying a modiﬁed Wiener
ﬁlter constructed from the PD PSF. By spatially repli-
cating the images before performing operations in the
Fourier domain, a reduction of the FOV as a side ef-
fect of a necessary apodisation could be avoided. Hence
the eﬀective FOV of the IMaX data from Sunrise II is
51(cid:48)(cid:48) × 51(cid:48)(cid:48).

The instrumental polarization was removed from the

observations by a demodulation matrix determined from
the pre-ﬂight polarimetric calibration.
In contrast to
the ﬁrst ﬂight, this time the ﬁeld-of-view dependence of
that matrix was taken into account. Since the on-ground
polarimeric calibration did not include the main mirror
of the telescope and because the thermal environment
during calibration was diﬀerent to the in-ﬂight situation,
cross-talk with Stokes I had to be removed from the
data. Then the images of the two cameras were co-
aligned and merged.

In addition, a slight periodic motion of the image was
removed, that was not present in the data of the ﬁrst
ﬂight and correlated well with the switching period of
the heating power of the LCVRs, which were mounted
near one of the folding mirrors. We also added a further
step to the data reduction pipeline that interpolated the
spectral scans with respect to time in order to compen-
sate for the solar evolution during the IMaX cycle time
of 36.5 s.

Finally, we determined the spatial mean Stokes I pro-
ﬁle and subtracted 25% of the mean proﬁle from the
individual proﬁles to correct the data for 25% global
stray light. This is equivalent to deconvolving the IMaX
data with a constant stray light not varying over the
FOV. Details of the stray-light properties of IMaX can
be found in Riethm¨uller et al. (2016).

The physical quantities of the solar atmosphere were
then retrieved from the reconstructed Stokes images
via the Stokes-Proﬁles-INversion-O-Routines (SPINOR;
Frutiger 2000; Frutiger et al. 2000), which uses the STO-
PRO routines to solve the Unno-Rachkovsky equations
(Solanki 1987). A relatively simple inversion strategy
was applied to get robust results: Three optical depth
nodes for the temperature (at log τ = −2.5, −0.9, 0) and
a height-independent magnetic ﬁeld vector, line-of-sight

velocity and micro-turbulence. The synthetic spectra
were not only calculated for the Fe i 5250.2 ˚A line but
also for its neighboring lines (Co i line at 5250.0 ˚A and
the Fe i line at 5250.6 ˚A) to also include their inﬂu-
ence. The spectral resolution of IMaX was taken into
account by convolving the synthesized spectra with the
spectral transmission proﬁle of IMaX measured in the
laboratory during a pre-ﬂight calibration campaign (see
bottom panel of Fig. 1 in Riethm¨uller et al. 2014).

The SPINOR inversion code was run for ten iterations,
then the output maps of the individual parameters were
spatially smoothed and used as the initial guess param-
eters to a further run of ten iterations. The interme-
diate smoothing of the free parameters of the inversion
was introduced to get rid of spatial discontinuities in
the physical quantities that can occur if the inversion
gets stuck in local minima of the merit function at in-
dividual pixels or groups of pixels. This procedure was
repeated ﬁve times (implying 50 iterations in all), with
a gradually decreasing amount of smoothing. Finally,
the resulting LOS velocity maps were corrected for the
etalon blueshift, which is caused by the collimated setup
(see Mart´ınez Pillet et al. 2011a).

6. EXAMPLES OF DATA AND SCIENCE RESULTS

6.1. NOAA AR 11768
The longest time series obtained by Sunrise II was
focussed on NOAA AR 11768 at cos θ = µ = 0.93, where
θ is the heliocentric angle. The observations were made
on 2013, June 12, starting at 23:39 UT, about 1.5 days
after the initial appearance of the active region, at a time
when magnetic ﬂux was still emerging. At that time
the active region had developed a full-ﬂedged leading
polarity sunspot, while the following polarity was mainly
concentrated in a string of pores.

The active region is illustrated in Fig. 4 at the time of
the Sunrise II observations. The IMaX and SuFI ﬁelds
of view (FOVs) are overplotted on an HMI continuum
image and an HMI magnetogram and are indicated by
the blue boxes.2
IMaX covered most of the following
magnetic polarity pores, including the largest one. The
largest pore had a complex structure and on one side
showed a feature with a roughly penumbral brightness
exhibiting elongated structures. In the course of the fur-
ther development, however, this feature did not develop
into a proper penumbra (as can be deduced from the an-

2 The SuFI FOV in Fig. 4 is the maximum that can be retrieved
from the detector. The width of the images shown in Fig. 5 is
lower for two reasons: if the broadest possible FOV is used, then
the quality of the reconstruction is lower and hence the resolution
is less high than in the images displayed in Fig. 5. Furthermore
only the common FOV of the various SuFI wavelength channels
is plotted in Fig. 5. Due to diﬀerential oﬀsets, this is smaller than
the FOV of each individual channel.

imation of Fig. 4). The IMaX FOV also contained some
of the leading polarity ﬂux, mainly in the form of facular
magnetic elements. Sunrise II also caught a region of
emerging ﬂux, to be found in the central southern part
of the IMaX FOV and partly in the much smaller SuFI
FOV, which captured mainly the region between the two
polarities, including one of the emergence events.

The animated Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the active
region from the very ﬁrst emergence 1.5 days prior to
the start of Sunrise II observations of this region to
approximately 1.5 days after the end of Sunrise II ob-
servations of this region. A signiﬁcant amount of ﬂux
appeared in the day after the Sunrise II observations,
which led to the formation of a proper following polar-
ity sunspot, as well as to an increased size of the leading
polarity spot, mainly through the coalescence of pores,
many of which already carried a piece of penumbra on
one side prior to merging. The blue boxes overlaid on
the images in the animated ﬁgure are tilted by the ro-
tation angle relative to solar North and the roughly 5◦
of rotation during the course of the SuFI time series is
taken into account. Note that the animated Fig. 4 runs
at a slower speed during the time of the Sunrise II ob-
servations of this region.

6.2. Sample SuFI data
The SuFI instrument during the second ﬂight of Sun-
rise provided diﬀraction-limited images at 3000 ˚A and
at 3968 ˚A in both the broader and the narrower channel
centred on the core of the Ca ii H line. An image at
each of these wavelengths is plotted in Fig. 5. Note that
during this, the longest time series obtained by SuFI,
no data in Mg ii k, nor in the 2140 ˚A channel were ob-
tained due to the low solar elevation at that time and the
consequent high atmospheric absorption at these wave-
lengths.

Strongly diﬀerent structures are seen at 3000 ˚A and in
the Ca ii H line, with the shorter wavelength displaying
granulation (as had already been noticed in the Sun-
rise I data, e.g., Solanki et al. 2010; Hirzberger et al.
2010), but also bright points (Riethm¨uller et al. 2010),
pores with internal ﬁne structure and a bright elongated
granule located at approximately 30–32(cid:48)(cid:48) in x-direction
and 15–16(cid:48)(cid:48) in the y-direction. This last feature is found
to be associated with magnetic ﬂux emergence. The two
brightest features in the 3000 ˚A image are located near
the two ends of this structure, on its left it brightens
to the level of a strong bright point, while there is a
bright facular region right at the edge of the FOV in the
continuation of the elongated granule on its right side.
The surprising lack of diﬀerence between the broader
and narrower Ca ii H channels in Fig. 5 suggests that
they were observing very similar layers of the Sun. Possi-
bly, the ﬁlter selecting the narrower channel had drifted

in wavelength (e.g. due to temperature changes in the
instrument) and was not centred exactly on Ca ii H3.
Due to the similarity between the broad and the narrow
Ca ii H channels, in the following the discussion will
concentrate on the narrower channel.

In the Ca ii H images the dominant structures are slen-
der ﬁbrils directed roughly across the SuFI FOV, many
of which seem to emanate from the large pore just to
the left of the SuFI image. They appear to be similar to
the ones observed earlier by Pietarila et al. (2009). Al-
though most of the ﬁlaments seem to roughly follow the
same direction, a number of them do cross each other.
This is particularly well seen close to the location of
the emerging magnetic ﬂux mentioned above, at around
(30–34(cid:48)(cid:48), 13–15(cid:48)(cid:48)). Very likely this is due to ﬁbrils be-
longing to previously existing magnetic ﬁeld overlying
the ﬁbrils associated with the emerging ﬂux that are di-
rected diﬀerently. The lengths of these ﬁbrils are hard to
determine, due to inhomogeneities that may be present
in the background, but some seem to extend over a fair
portion of the width of the SuFI images. Strikingly, the
ﬁbrils are also constantly evolving and in motion. The
lengths, along with other properties of these ﬁbrils, are
studied in a further paper in this special issue (Gafeira et
al. 2016a), while the dynamics of the ﬁbrils, in particular
wave modes travelling along them, are investigated by

Jafarzadeh et al. (2016b) and by Gafeira et al. (2016b).
The brightenings seen at 3000 ˚A in connection with
the ﬂux emergence are also visible in Ca ii H. The mag-
netic ﬂux emergence caught by IMaX and SuFI is in-
vestigated by Centeno et al. (2016) and Danilovic et
al. (2016). At a later stage during the time series this
brightening develops further into a small ﬂare that en-
gulfs the emerging ﬂux region and is prominently visible
in the Ca ii H line.

SuFI on board Sunrise II also obtained the ﬁrst high-
resolution images in the Mg ii k line, which have al-
ready been published in two early papers (Riethm¨uller
et al. 2013b; Danilovic et al. 2014). Images taken in the
Mg ii k ﬁlter were found to have considerable similarity
with nearly simultaneously recorded Ca ii H images, al-
though some distinct diﬀerences were also found. These
included a 1.4–1.7 times larger intensity contrast and a
more smeared appearance. Exampls of Mg ii k images of
quiet Sun and of a weak plage/enhanced network region
are shown in Fig. 6. These images were exposed for 50
s to counter the strong atmospheric absorption at this
wavelength and to obtain a suﬃcient S/N ratio. The im-
ages are based on SuFI level 3 data, i.e. data that have
been phase-diversity reconstructed using wave-front er-
rors averaged over the whole time series of images. See
Hirzberger et al. (2011) for more details on reduction

and phase-diversity reconstruction of SuFI data.

It was concluded that some of these diﬀerences may
be caused by the much longer integration time needed
to record the Mg ii k images due to the strong ozone
absorption at that wavelength, while others are likely
intrinsic. Possible reasons for the intrinsic diﬀerences
given by Danilovic et al. (2014) include greater forma-
tion height and greater formation height range of the Mg
line (the latter due to the rather broad Mg ﬁlter) and
the stronger response of the emission peaks of Mg ii k
to temperature.

6.3. Sample IMaX data and inversion results

The continuum intensity in the visible recorded by
IMaX at +227 m˚A from the line centre is plotted in
Fig. 7a. IMaX images contain a larger number of pores
than SuFI due to the bigger FOV. As expected for the
continuum intensity at 5250 ˚A, bright points are much
less prominent than at 3000 ˚A (Fig. 5a), although the
ﬁne structure in the largest pore is well visible, with
some of the bright “umbral dots” being among the
brighter structures in the image. Also well visible in that
ﬁgure is the long elongated granule already pointed out

in the 3000 ˚A image (located at (30(cid:48)(cid:48),15(cid:48)(cid:48)) in the IMaX
FOV). Another similar granule is found to its right.
Both are associated with magnetic ﬂux emergence.

The bright points in the line core image displayed in
Fig. 7b, often forming connected chains ﬁlling the in-
tergranular lanes, possess a high contrast. Here, what
we refer to as the line core intensity is simply the in-
tensity at the central IMaX wavelength point, which is
nominally located at the wavelength of the Fe i 5250.2 ˚A
line core. Chains of such bright points surround most
of the pores, but the most prominent bright feature in
this image is the strong brightening located between the
two elongated granules, i.e. between the two small ﬂux
emergence events. The line core of Fe i 5250.2 ˚A obvi-
ously forms below the height of formation of the radia-
tion sampled by either of the two SuFI Ca ii H ﬁlters, as
the iron line core image still shows faint vestiges of gran-
ulation and no signs of ﬁbrils. All quantities in Fig. 7
are normalized to the respective intensity averaged over
two areas within the joint IMaX and SuFI FOV with
near-quiet Sun conditions, i.e. a relatively low magnetic
ﬂux density. We call this averaged “quiet-Sun” inten-

sity, IQS. Note that the granule pattern changes to that
of reversed granulation if instead of being divided by
IQS, as is the case in Fig. 7b, the line core intensity is
divided by the local continuum intensity, i.e. I+227, at
each pixel (Kahil et al. 2016).

Stokes I, Q, U and V in the red ﬂank of 5250.2 are
plotted in Figs. 7c–f. The diﬀerences between Fig. 7c
and Figs. 7a and b are due to the formation height of the
line ﬂank (at +40 m˚A) lying between those of the other
two wavelengths and the fact that the intensity in the
line ﬂank, i.e., in Fig. 7c, is very sensitive to the Doppler
shift of the spectral line. The intensity in the line core,
as plotted in Fig. 7b, is also aﬀected by Doppler shifts,
but to a much lesser extent than the line ﬂanks.

Maps of the best-ﬁt parameters obtained from the in-
version of the IMaX Stokes vectors illustrated in Fig. 7,
are presented in Fig. 8. The panels in the upper row
display the temperature at the three nodes at which
it was determined,
log(τ ) = −0.9 and
log(τ ) = 0,
log(τ ) = −2.5, the lower row of panels gives the mag-
netic ﬁeld strength, B, the inclination of the magnetic
ﬁeld relative to the line-of-sight, γ, and the line-of-sight

velocity, vLOS.

The results of the inversions reveal some conspicuous
features. Among these are the strong blue- and redshifts
in the granulation (note that we have not removed the p-
modes from the inverted data, so that the velocities are
inﬂuenced by such oscillations). The velocity amplitude
is larger than in the granulation shown by Solanki et al.
(2010). An important reason for this is that scattered
light has been removed from the present data, while the
data analysed by Solanki et al. (2010) were still aﬀected
by scattered light. Some discrepancy can also be intro-
duced because the velocities displayed by Solanki et al.
(2010) were obtained from a Gaussian ﬁt to line proﬁles
sampled at 4 wavelengths, while the velocities presented
here were provided by the SPINOR inversions of line
proﬁles sampled at 7 wavelength points. One of the
emerging ﬂux patches is found to be associated with a
strong blueshift, much stronger than the other emerging
ﬂux feature.

6.4. Pores

One noticeable feature of the inversion results is that
the photospheric ﬁeld strength in pores often reaches
2500 G (compareble with the highest values found from
Hinode data after deconvolving with the PSF; Quintero
Noda et al. 2016). In some places higher ﬁeld strengths
are reached, but these cannot be trusted due to the lim-
ited wavelength range of the observations and the fact
that the continuum point at +227 m˚A starts to be af-
fected.

Another striking feature is that whereas all pores are
clearly cooler than their surroundings at the two lower
heights (log τ = 0, −0.9), only the larger pores are
clearly distinguishable from their surroundings in the
temperature map at log τ = −2.5. The smaller pores
can hardly be separated from their surroundings.
In
contrast, the line core image in Fig. 7 shows a darken-
ing also at the locations of the smallest pores. However,
this is mainly due to the lower continuum intensity at
these locations. Also, the line core is aﬀected by the Zee-
man eﬀect and to a smaller extent also Doppler shifts, so
that it is not an unalloyed measure of the temperature.
In order to test whether the inversions are giving a rea-
sonable representation of the temperature stratiﬁcation
in pores we consider the SuFI Ca ii H channel.

To compare SuFI and IMaX data the images at indi-
vidual SuFI wavelengths were aligned to sub-pixel accu-
racy with the most similar IMaX images. For 3000 ˚A
this is the 5250.4 ˚A continuum, while the Ca ii H chan-
nel is compared with the IMaX line core, normalized to
I+227 at each pixel individually (then the images look
more similar). More information on the procedure are
provided by Kaithakkal et al. (2016), cf. Jafarzadeh et
al. (2016b).

continuum intensity, I+227, (b) line core intensity (i.e. intensity in the wavelength channel nominally located at the line core),
(c)–(f) the Stokes I, Q, U and V values at +40 m˚A from line centre. All quantities are given in units of the respective quiet-Sun
intensity, IQS.

Thumbnails of T at log τ = 0, −0.9 and −2.5 as well
as of IMaX continuum intensity, I+227, and the inten-
sity in SuFI 3000 and 3968n ˚A channels (”n” is for the
narrow Ca ii H channel introduced in Sect. 2.2) are plot-
ted in Fig. 9 for two small pores in the top-right part
of the SuFI FOV, and in Fig. 10 for a single very small,
somewhat weaker pore in the lower part of the SuFI
FOV. Overlaid on both pores are contours of the 1400 G
level of the magnetic ﬁeld. In the following, we consider
this contour as an independent boundary of the pore, or
more exactly of the magnetic concentration underlying
the pore.

1400 G is found to be a good compromise, on the
one hand, to isolate a pore from the bright points in
its neighbourhood, while, on the other hand, keeping as

much of the pore as possible within the contour. E.g.
if we take 1200 G or 1300 G, then the bright points
often found in the immediate vicinity of pores are in-
cluded in the contours of some of the pores. If, however,
we use a larger value, such as 1500 G or 1600 G, then
we include less of the dark part of the pore in the con-
tour. To illustrate this we have added also contours of
1200 G and 1600 G besides those of 1400 G in Fig. 9.
The 1200 G contour includes bright extensions from the
smaller (lower-left) pore in this image, while the 1600 G
contour misses a signiﬁcant fraction of the upper right
pore.

Interestingly, the 1400 G contour often lies outside the
actual pores as seen in, e.g., I+227 or the SuFI 3000 ˚A
channel. When comparing with I+227, a part of this dif-

ference may have to do with the expansion of the ﬁeld
with height. However, the diﬀerence in size is just as
large when considering the temperature at log τ = −0.9,
which is much closer to the height at which the magnetic
ﬁeld is determined. Hence, these images demonstrate
that pores are surrounded by regions of strong magnetic
ﬁeld that extend well beyond the visible boundaries of
the individual pores (see also Mart´ınez Pillet 1997). Of
course, the magnetic ﬁeld, being determined from mul-
tiple recordings, is more susceptible to jitter, and may
not have the same high resolution as the individual im-
ages it is compared with. This extension of strong ﬁelds
beyond the boundary of the pore still holds even if we
consider a threshold of 1500 G or even 1600 G, even as
some of the dark parts of the pores no longer lie within

the 1600 G contour.

clearly dark, while in Ca ii H the picture is more mixed.
Whereas the pore in Fig. 10 is clearly as bright as its sur-
roundings and even has a particularly bright intrusion,
the pores seen in Fig. 9 both appear to be somewhat
darker than their immediate surroundings.

We note, however, that the immediate surroundings
of the pores in the Ca images are relatively bright (see
Fig. 5). The pores are often surrounded by considerable
magnetic ﬂux that produces a local brightening. In radi-
ation coming from the lower photosphere, some of this

is visible as bright points, or particularly bright gran-
ules or granule walls (similar to faculae near the limb,
e.g., Lites et al. 2004; Keller et al. 2004; Carlsson et al.
2004). In the low chromosphere, however, this concen-
tration of magnetic ﬂux produces enhanced brightenings
in the form of mainly short ﬁbrils surrounding the pores.
The pores are not substantially darker than other, less
bright parts of the solar surface in the Ca ii H ﬁlter (see
Fig. 5).

To study this more quantitatively, we plot the corre-
sponding histograms in Figs. 11 and 12. Each set of
histograms represents either the three temperatures, at
log τ = 0, −0.9, −2.5 (left panels), or the three inten-
sities (IMaX I+227, SuFI 3000 ˚A, SuFI 3968n ˚A; right
panels) studied here. All intensities and temperatures
in Figs. 11 and 12 are normalized to patches of com-
paratively quiet Sun (i.e. with low amounts of magnetic
ﬂux) near the top left and the bottom of the SuFI FOV.

In all pores the temperatures in the two lower lay-
ers and the intensities at the wavelengths formed deeper
(IMaX I+227 and SuFI 3000 ˚A) are predominantly lower
than in the quiet Sun. The pixels in which they are
higher are often the hot walls of neighbouring gran-
ules that are seen through a strong magnetic ﬁeld. The
same is true for the intensities in the two deeper-forming
wavelengths. The temperature at the top node and the
brightness in the Ca ii H channel behave quite diﬀer-
ently, however. The temperature lies below the quiet-
Sun value for only a small fraction of the points. The
same is also true for the Ca intensity, for which the ratio
of hotter and brighter points to cooler and darker ones
is even more extreme.

Hence, although the small pores partly remain visible
as dark features relative to their immediate surroundings
in the lower chromosphere, they are approximately as
bright as, or even brighter than the quiet Sun at those

layers. The most extreme enhancement is displayed by
the smallest of the three pores, with the largest being
the coolest and darkest (by a small amount) of these
three.

The largest pore in the IMaX FOV (and partly in the
SuFI FOV) does remain considerably darker than the
quiet Sun, even in the Ca images, which unfortunately
cover only a small part of the whole pore. Nonetheless,
the behaviour of the various pores taken together sug-
gests that the diﬀerence in the vertical temperature gra-
dient within these pores to that in the quiet Sun depends
signiﬁcantly on the size of the pore. The photospheric
temperature gradient is ﬂattest for the smallest pores,
with the temperature starting nearly 1000 K below the
average quiet-Sun value at the solar surface and reach-
ing the quiet-Sun value in the upper photosphere. For
large pores, however, the temperature gradient appears
to be more similar to that in the quiet Sun.

Inhomogeneities in brightness and temperature within
the pores also decrease with height. Thus, in Fig. 9
the umbral dot-like brightenings in the pore at the up-

per right of the frame are well visible in the I+227 at
5250.4 ˚A, but only very weakly visible at 3000 ˚A, which
is formed only about 50 km higher, and cannot be seen
at all at 3968 ˚A. This suggests that such inhomogeneities
are likely of convective origin, as proposed by Parker
(1979); Choudhuri (1986); Sch¨ussler & V¨ogler (2006) for
umbral dots. In sunspot umbrae a similar restriction to
low heights of the thermal enhancements/brightenings
associated with umbral dots have been found by, e.g.,
Socas-Navarro et al. (2004); Riethm¨uller et al. (2008);
Riethm¨uller et al. (2013a).

7. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
The second science ﬂight of Sunrise in June 2013 al-
lowed this balloon-borne solar observatory to obtain the
ﬁrst seeing-free observations of an active region close
to the diﬀraction limit of the 1 m diameter telescope.
These data are rich in information about a variety of
solar phenomena at very high spatial resolution and at
wavelengths that can partly not be accessed from the
ground. Below we list some of the ﬁndings that have

been obtained from these data, most of which are pre-
sented in various papers of this special issue.

In the present paper we have, besides providing an
overview of the instrumentation and the mission, con-
sidered thermal properties of pores as an illustration of
the capabilities of the Sunrise II data. Earlier, the
ﬁrst ever high-resolution images of the quiet and active
Sun in the Mg ii k line, obtained during the Sunrise II
ﬂight, were reported by Riethm¨uller et al. (2013b) and
Danilovic et al. (2014).

In the special issue a study by Centeno et al. (2016) re-
ports on two emerging ﬂux events, describing in greater
detail than previously possible the interrelated dynamics
of the gas and the ﬁeld, as well as the likely occurance
of magnetic reconnection during the emergence. The
properties of a likely siphon ﬂow and of the small, ini-
tially low-lying loop connecting magnetic elements with
a pore are deduced by Requerey et al. (2016b) and the
3-D structure of the magnetic ﬁeld lines and hence of the
ﬂow vector are determined. The properties and dynam-
ics of moving magnetic features (MMFs) on one side
of the largest pore in the IMaX FOV are deduced by
Kaithakkal et al. (2016) and contrasted with the prop-
erties of MMFs around sunspots. The proper motion of
magnetic bright points in diﬀerent parts of the quiet Sun
and of an active region are analysed by Jafarzadeh et al.
(2016a). They ﬁnd very diﬀerent behaviours depend-
ing on the location, with the features moving strongly
superdiﬀusively in the internetwork, diﬀusively in the
network and in between these extremes in the active re-
gion. Riethm¨uller et al. (2016) present a novel inversion
technique employing MHD simulations to provide the
model atmospheres needed to compute synthetic Stokes
vectors that reproduce the observed Stokes parameters.
They illustrate the quality of the inversions by applying
the technique to the Sunrise II polarimetric data.

The properties of the slender ﬁbrils dominating the
SuFI Ca ii H images are determined by Gafeira et al.
(2016a), who show that the ﬁbrils live much longer than
a simple analysis would suggest, if one takes into ac-
count that they often fade away and reappear after some
time. The discovery of ubiquitous transverse waves trav-
elling along these ﬁbrils and carrying copious amounts
of energy is reported by Jafarzadeh et al. (2016b), while
Gafeira et al. (2016b) present the discovery of compress-
ible waves travelling along the ﬁbrils, which they iden-
tify as sausage waves. Jafarzadeh et al. (2016d) ﬁnd
evidence that these slender ﬁbrils seen in Ca ii H out-
line a canopy of magnetic ﬁeld lying below that known
from Hα and Ca ii 8542 ˚A ﬁbril observations.

Chitta et al. (2016) observed that coronal loops are
rooted in regions with mixed-polarity ﬁelds. They pro-
vide evidence for ﬂux cancellation and presence of in-
verse Y-shaped jets (signatures of magnetic reconnec-

tion) at the base of coronal loops that might supply
(hot) plasma to the overlying coronal loop. They sug-
gest a revision of the traditional picture in which each
loop footpoint is smoothly connected to unipolar regions
on the solar surface. Danilovic et al. (2016) compare an
Ellerman bomb observed by Sunrise II with a similar,
simulated event in which magnetic reconnection occurs
at the location of emerging ﬂux. The 3D radiation-
MHD simulation reveals the complexity of the under-
lying physical process and the limitations of the obser-
vational data. Thus, the Sunrise/IMaX data cannot
determine the height at which magnetic reconnection
takes place. The authors also show, however, that the
velocity and magnetic vector measured at the high res-
olution of Sunrise/IMaX reveals how shortcomings of
the MHD simulations can be overcome.

Wiegelmann et al. (2016) have computed general
linear magneto-static equilibria of the magnetic ﬁeld
and gas using the Sunrise II/IMaX observations as a
boundary condition. In this way they obtain the mag-
netic ﬁeld structure in the upper atmosphere without
having to assume the validity of the force-free assump-
tion in the solar photosphere. They computed linear
magneto-static equilibria for all the IMaX frames of the
active region, without the problems faced when mod-
elling the magnetic ﬁeld in diﬀerent atmospheric layers
of the quiet Sun.

In addition to the exciting results obtained from the
Sunrise II ﬂight brieﬂy mentioned above, the present
special issue also contains a number of papers that are
based on data from the Sunrise I ﬂight. These data
are still unique in terms of consistently high resolu-
tion polarimetric and UV time series of the quiet Sun.
Such papers include the investigation by Requerey et
al. (2016a) in which the authors uncover the tight con-
nection between concentrated magnetic ﬁelds and con-
vectively driven sinks in the quiet Sun. Kahil et al.
(2016) probe the relationship between brightness con-
trast at UV and visible wavelengths and the magnetic
ﬂux in the quiet Sun, ﬁnding that the contrast keeps
increasing with magnetic ﬂux, unlike most earlier ob-
servational results, but in qualitative agreement with
MHD simulations. Jafarzadeh et al. (2016c) characterise
the wave modes observed at two heights in magnetic
bright points, including both, compressible waves seen
in brightness ﬂuctuations and transverse waves obtained
from proper motions. The short travel times suggest
large wave speeds. A new estimate of the ﬂux emer-
gence rate in the quiet Sun is obtained by Smitha et
al. (2016). Compared with the emergence rate deduced
from Hinode/SOT data using the same technique, the
emergence rate obtained from Sunrise I data is around
an order of magnitude larger.

Clearly, the data from both ﬂights of Sunrise remain

rich in their information content and it is expected that
many more results will be gleaned from them in the
coming years. In parallel with the scientiﬁc analysis of
the data, preparations are starting for a third ﬂight of
Sunrise. It is planned that on such a ﬂight the obser-
vatory will carry upgraded science instruments as well
as new spectropolarimetric ones that provide more in-
formation on the magnetic ﬁeld and its inﬂuence on the
solar atmosphere, with particular emphasis on the solar
chromosphere.
