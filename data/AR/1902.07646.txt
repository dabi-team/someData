Abstract

A new implementation is proposed for including van der Waals (vdW) interactions in Density

Functional Theory (DFT) using the Maximally-Localized Wannier functions (MLWFs), which is

free from empirical parameters. With respect to the previous DFT/vdW-WF2 method, in the

present DFT/vdW-WF2-x approach, the empirical, short-range, damping function is replaced by an

estimate of the Pauli exchange repulsion, also obtained by the MLWFs properties. Applications to

systems contained in the popular S22 molecular database and to the case of an Ar atom interacting

with graphite, and comparison with reference data, indicate that the new method, besides being

more physically founded, also leads to a systematic improvement in the description of vdW-bonded

systems.

INTRODUCTION

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a well-established computational approach to study

the structural and electronic properties of condensed matter systems from ﬁrst principles.

Although current, approximated density functionals allow a quantitative description at much

lower computational cost than other ﬁrst principles methods, they fail1 to properly describe

dispersion interactions. Dispersion forces originate from correlated charge oscillations in
separate fragments of matter and the most important component is represented by the R−6
van der Waals (vdW) interaction,2 due to correlated instantaneous dipole ﬂuctuations. These

interactions play a fundamental role in determining the structure, stability, and function of

a wide variety of systems, including molecules, clusters, proteins, nanostructered materials,

molecular solids and liquids, and in adsorption processes of fragments weakly interacting

with a substrate (”physisorbed”).

In the last few years a variety of practical methods have been proposed to make DFT

calculations able to accurately describe vdW eﬀects (for a review, see, for instance, refs. 3–

8). In this respect, a family of such methods, all based on the Maximally Localized Wannier

Functions (MLWFs),9 has been developed, namely the original DFT/vdW-WF scheme,10–12

DFT/vdW-WF213 (based on the London expression and taking into account the intrafrag-

ment overlap of the MLWFs), DFT/vdW-WF2s14 (including metal-screening corrections),

and DFT/vdW-QHO-WF15 (adopting the coupled Quantum Harmonic Oscillator model),

successfully applied to a variety of systems:10–22 small molecules, water clusters, graphite

and graphene, water layers interacting with graphite, interfacial water on semiconducting

substrates, hydrogenated carbon nanotubes, molecular solids, the interaction of rare gases

and small molecules with metal surfaces,...

In all these methods a certain degree of empiricism is present since the energetic vdW-

correction term is multiplied by a short-range damping function, which is introduced not only

to avoid the unphysical divergence of the vdW correction at small fragment separations, but

also to eliminate double countings of correlation eﬀects (in fact standard DFT approaches

are able to describe short-range correlations). This damping function contains one or more

empirical parameters which are typically set by a trial and error approach or/and are ﬁtted

using some reference database.

In the present paper we overcome the above limitation by presenting a new method, here-

2

after referred to as DFT/vdW-WF2-x, where the empirical, short-range, damping function

is replaced by an estimate of the Pauli exchange repulsion, also obtained by the MLWFs

properties. The new approach is successfully applied to the popular S22 benchmark set23 of

weakly interacting molecules and also to the case of an Ar atom interacting with graphite.

The results are compared with reference data and indicate that the new method leads to a

systematic improvement in the description of vdW-bonded systems.

II. METHOD

Here we describe and apply a new implementation of the DFT/vdW-WF2 method, in-

troduced in ref. 13 and summarized below. Basically, the electronic charge partitioning is

achieved using the Maximally-Localized Wannier Functions (MLWFs), which are obtained

from a unitary transformation in the space of the occupied Bloch states, by minimizing the

total spread functional:9

The localization properties of the MLWFs are of particular interest for the implementation

of an eﬃcient vdW correction scheme: in fact, the MLWFs represent a suitable basis set to

evaluate orbital-orbital vdW interaction terms. In particular, if two interacting atoms, A

and B, are approximated2 by coupled harmonic oscillators, the vdW energy correction can

be taken to be the change of the zero-point energy of the coupled oscillations as the atoms

approach; if only a single excitation frequency is associated to each atom, ωA, ωB, then

(2)

where ZA,B is the total charge of A and B, and RAB is the distance between the two atoms

(e and m are the electronic charge and mass). Now, adopting a simple classical theory of the

atomic polarizability, the polarizability of an electronic shell of charge eZi and mass mZi,

tied to a heavy undeformable ion can be written as

αi ≃

Zie2
mω2
i

.

3

(3)

Then, given the direct relation between polarizability and atomic volume,24 we assume

γS3

that αi ∼
in terms of the MLWF spread, Si. Rewriting eq. (2) in terms of the quantities deﬁned

i , where γ is a proportionality constant, so that the atomic volume is expressed

above, one obtains an explicit, simple expression for the C6 vdW coeﬃcient:

C AB

6 =

2

√ZAZBS3

Bγ3/2

AS3
A + √ZAS3/2
B )

(√ZBS3/2

.

(4)

The constant γ can then be set up by imposing that the exact value for the H atom

polarizability (αH =4.5 a.u.) is obtained. This appears to be a physically sound choice
since, in the H case, one knows the exact analytical spread, Si = SH = √3 a.u.

In order to achieve a better accuracy, one must properly deal with intrafragment MLWF

overlap (we refer here to charge overlap, not to be confused with wave functions overlap): in

fact, the method is strictly valid for nonoverlapping fragments only; now, while the overlap

between the MLWFs relative to separated fragments is usually negligible for all the fragment

separation distances of interest, the same is not true for the MLWFs belonging to the same

fragment, which are often characterized by a signiﬁcant overlap. This overlap aﬀects the

eﬀective orbital volume, the polarizability, and the excitation frequency (see eq. (3)), thus

leading to a quantitative eﬀect on the value of the C6 coeﬃcient. We take into account the

eﬀective change in volume due to intrafragment MLWF overlap by introducing a suitable

reduction factor ξ obtained by interpolating between the limiting cases of fully overlapping

and non-overlapping MLWFs. In particular, since in the DFT/vdW-WF2 method the i-th

MLWF is approximated with a homogeneous charged sphere of radius Si, then the overlap

among neighboring MLWFs can be evaluated as the geometrical overlap among neighboring

spheres. To derive the correct volume reweighting factor for dealing with overlap eﬀects, we

ﬁrst consider the limiting case of two pairs (one for each fragment) of completely overlapping

MLWFs, which would be, for instance, applicable to two interacting He atoms if each MLWF

just describes the density distribution of a single electron; then we can evaluate a single C6

coeﬃcient using eq. (4) with ZA,B = 2, so that:

√2S3
(S3/2
Alternatively, the same expression can be obtained by considering the sum of 4 identical

pairwise contributions (with Z = 1), by introducing a modiﬁcation of the eﬀective volume in

4

such a way to take the overlap into account and make the global interfragment C6 coeﬃcient

equivalent to that in eq. (5). This is clearly accomplished by replacing S3
i

in eq. (4) with

ξS3
i , where ξ = 1/2. This procedure can be easily generalized to multiple overlaps, by
weighting the overlapping volume with the factor n−1, where n is the number of overlapping

MLWFs. Finally, by extending the approach to partial overlaps, we deﬁne the free volume

of a set of MLWFs belonging to a given fragment (in practice three-dimensional integrals

are evaluated by numerical sums introducing a suitable mesh in real space) as:

Vf ree =

dr wf ree(r)

∆r

≃

Xl

wf ree(rl)

(6)

< Si for at least one of the fragment MLWFs, and is

ri|

Z
rl −

where wf ree(rl) is equal to 1 if

0 otherwise.

The corresponding eﬀective volume is instead given by

Vef f =

Z

dr wef f (r)

∆r

≃

Xl

wef f (rl) ,

(7)

where the new weighting function is deﬁned as wef f (rl) = wf ree(rl)

·

that is equal to the number of MLWFs contemporarily satisfying the relation

nw(rl)−1, with nw(rl)
rl −

< Si.

ri|

|

Therefore, the non overlapping portions of the spheres (in practice the corresponding mesh

points) will be associated to a weight factor 1, those belonging to two spheres to a 1/2 factor,

and, in general, those belonging to n spheres to a 1/n factor. The average ratio between the

eﬀective volume and the free volume (Vef f /Vf ree) is then assigned to the factor ξ, appearing

in eq. (8). Although in principle the correction factor ξ must be evaluated for each MLWF

and the calculations must be repeated at diﬀerent fragment-fragment separations, our tests

show that, in practice, if the fragments are rather homogeneous all the ξ factors are very

similar, and if the spreads of the MLWFs do not change signiﬁcantly in the range of the

interfragment distances of interest, the ξ’s remain essentially constant; clearly, exploiting

this behavior leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in the computational cost of accounting for the

intrafragment overlap. We therefore arrive at the following expression for the C6 coeﬃcient:

(√ZBξAS3/2

(8)

where ξA,B represents the ratio between the eﬀective and the free volume associated to

the A-th and B-th MLWF. The need for a proper treatment of overlap eﬀects has been also

5

pointed out by Andrinopoulos et al.,12 who however applied a correction only to very closely

centred WFCs.

Finally, in the original DFT/vdW-WF2 method, the vdW interaction energy was com-

puted as:

where f (Rij) is a short-range damping function, which is introduced not only to avoid the

unphysical divergence of the vdW correction at small fragment separations, but also to

eliminate double countings of correlation eﬀects (in fact standard DFT approaches are able

to describe short-range correlations); it is deﬁned as:

f (Rij) =

1
1 + e−a(Rij /Rs−1) .

(10)

The parameter Rs represents the sum of the vdW radii Rs = RvdW

adopting the same criterion chosen above for the γ parameter)

is the literature25 (1.20 ˚A) vdW radius of the H atom, and, following Grimme

20. Although a is the only ad-hoc parameter of the method, while all the

≃

others are only determined by the basic information given by the MLWFs (that is from ﬁrst

principles calculations) and in many applications the results are only mildly dependent on

the particular value of a, nonetheless, this parameter, together with the choice of a speciﬁc

form of the above damping function, clearly imply a certain degree of empiricism.

In order to overcome this limitation, we propose to improve the approach by replacing

the somehow artiﬁcial, short-range damping function by a term that directly measures the

quantum mechanical Pauli exchange repulsion between electronic orbitals and can be entirely

expressed in terms of the MLWFs properties, without the need of introducing empirical

parameters. Following ref. 27, using the dipole approximation for the Coulomb interaction,

the exchange integral, for two closed electronic shells with total zero spin, is simply given

by:

Jex =

q2O
2R

,

6

(12)

where q indicates the electronic charge of each electronic shell and O is the overlap

integral between the electronic shells, separated by R. In our speciﬁc case, assuming that an

electronic orbital is described by the wave function relative to a quantum harmonic oscillator:

ψA(r) =

where SA is the spread of the corresponding MLWF, then one can easily obtain that :

Then, the exchange integral can be expressed in terms of the MLWFs spreads as :

Therefore, in this new DFT/vdW-WF2-x version of the method, the vdW interaction

energy is computed as:

EvdW =

(16)

In this way the vdW energy correction is evaluated as the sum of two terms, both ex-

pressed in terms of the MLWfs spreads, thus making explicit the direct connection between

attractive and repulsive parts of the vdW interaction.27

Of course there are very weakly bonded systems, entirely dominated by vdW eﬀects,

where the repulsive term is not relevant for determining the equilibrium complex conﬁgura-

tion. For instance, in the Ar-dimer case, DFT/vdW-WF2 and DFT/vdW-WF2-x predict the

same equilibrium Ar-Ar distance and the same binding energy (within 0.1 meV). However,

in most cases, a proper treatment of short-range repulsion is crucial to correctly describe

the minimum, equilibrium conﬁguration.

The calculations have been performed with both the CPMD28 and the Quantum-

ESPRESSO ab initio package29 (in the latter case the MLWFs have been generated as

a post-processing calculation using the WanT package30), using norm-conserving or ultra-

soft pseudopotentials to describe the electron-ion interactions and taking mainly PBE31 as

the reference, Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT functional, although test

calculations have been also carried out using the BLYP32 GGA functional. PBE and BLYP

7

are chosen because they represent two of the most popular GGA functionals for standard

DFT simulations of condensed-matter systems.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In order to assess the accuracy of the DFT/vdW-WF2-x method we ﬁrst consider the

S22 database of intermolecular interactions,23 a widely used benchmark database, consisting

of weakly interacting molecules (a set of 22 weakly interacting dimers mostly of biological

importance), with reference binding energies calculated by a number of diﬀerent groups us-

ing high-level quantum chemical methods. In particular, we use the basis-set extrapolated

CCSD(T) binding energies calculated by Takatani et al.33 These binding energies are pre-

sumed to have an accuracy of about 0.1 kcal/mol (1% relative error). Calculations have

been performed using the same technical parameters adopted in ref. 15.

Table I summarizes the results of our calculations on the S22 database, at the DFT/vdW-

WF2-x level, considering PBE (DFT/vdW-WF2-x(PBE)) or BLYP (DFT/vdW-WF2-

x(BLYP)) as the reference DFT functional, compared to those obtained by other vdW-

corrected DFT schemes, namely DFT/vdW-WF2,13 vdW-DF,34,35 vdW-DF2,36 VV1037 and

rVV1038 (the revised, computationally much more eﬃcient version of the VV10 method),

PBE+TS-vdW,39 and PBE+MBD.40 For the sake of completeness we also report data rela-

tive to the semiempirical PBE-D326 approach and to the bare, non-vdW-corrected, PBE and

BLYP functionals. In Table II, the performance of diﬀerent schemes is illustrated by sepa-

rately considering Hydrogen-bonded, dispersion, and mixed complexes, while Fig. 1 reports

the behavior of the binding energy for all the 22 complexes contained in the S22 database,

listed (for the sake of better visibility) in the order of increasing (absolute) value of the

reference, binding energy. As expected, considering the whole S22 database, pure PBE and

BLYP perform poorly and a substantial improvement can be obtained by vdW-corrected

approaches. More importantly, the performances of the new DFT/vdW-WF2-x scheme are

clearly better than those of the previous DFT/vdW-WF2 method. In particular, the general

tendency of DFT/vdW-WF2 to overbind is considerably reduced by DFT/vdW-WF2-x. In-

terestingly, with DFT/vdW-WF2-x(PBE) the mean absolute error (MAE), 0.78 kcal/mol,

is well below the so-called ”chemical accuracy” threshold of 1 kcal/mol, required to at-

tribute a genuine quantitative character to the predictions of an ab initio scheme. Moreover,

8

DFT/vdW-WF2-x(PBE) performs better than the more sophisticated vdW-DF and vdW-

DF2 methods, based on the use of a nonlocal expression for the correlation energy-term,

is comparable, as far as the S22 database is concerned to PBE-D3, and its performances

are only inferior to those of the rVV10, VV10, PBE+TS-vdW, and PBE+MBD schemes,

which are among the most accurate vdW-corrected DFT approaches for noncovalently bound

complexes.38,40 As can be seen, looking at Table II, DFT/vdW-WF2-x(PBE) turns out to be

better than DFT/vdW-WF2-x(BLYP) for both dispersion-dominated and mixed complexes,

while instead the opposite is true for Hydrogen-bonded complexes.

In order to test the applicability of the present DFT/vdW-WF2-x method also to a

representative of extended systems, which of course is of particular interest because, in

this case, high-quality chemistry methods are typically too computationally demanding, we

considered the adsorption of a single Ar atom on graphite, that is a typical physisorption

process. Calculations have been performed using the same DFT approach followed in ref.

41 and considering the adsorption on the more favored hollow site only. Table III reports

the binding energy, Eb, and equilibrium distance R, for an Ar atom adsorbed on graphite,

while in Fig. 2 the corresponding binding energy curves are shown. Data obtained at the

PBE, DFT/vdW-WF2(PBE), and DFT/vdW-WF2-x(PBE) level are compared to reference

theoretical and experimental estimates. Theoretical values were obtained by Tkatchenko

et al.,42 with a DFT-vdW corrected scheme based on a semiempirical dispersion calibrated

atom-centered potential, and by Bichoutskaia and Pyper, with the inclusion of Axilord-

Teller dispersion interactions.43 As can be seen, the pure PBE functional largely underbinds

while vdW-corrected schemes predict a much stronger Ar-graphite interaction with the for-

mation of a clear minimum in the binding energy curve at a shorter equilibrium distance.

At relatively large Ar-graphite distances, as expected, the DFT/vdW-WF2-x(PBE) curve

approaches the DFT/vdW-WF2(PBE) one, since the repulsive term becomes irrelevant.

However, near the equilibrium position, which is just determined by an interplay between

attractive vdW interaction and repulsion, the diﬀerences in the binding energies are signif-

icant, with DFT/vdW-WF2-x(PBE) which represents an evident improvement compared

to DFT/vdW-WF2(PBE), and, in line with what previously observed in the application to

the S22 database, leads to a reduction of the binding-energy estimate, thus showing that

the eﬀect of the repulsive term is more relevant. This can be seen more explicitly looking

at Fig. 3, where the repulsive contribution (see eq.

(9)) of the DFT/vdW-WF2(PBE)

9

,

is compared to that (see eq.

(16)) of DFT/vdW-WF2-

ex(Rij). Clearly, the repulsive term vanishes for Ar-graphite distances larger
x(PBE),
than 4 ˚A, however, around the equilibrium distance (and at shorter distances), it is much

P

more substantial in the DFT/vdW-WF2-x(PBE) approach than in DFT/vdW-WF2(PBE).

The DFT/vdW-WF2-x(PBE) binding energy (-115 meV) is very close to the values re-

ported by Tkatchenko et al.42 (-116 meV) and Bichoutskaia and Pyper43 (-111 meV). More-

over, this value is also compatible with one of the few experimental estimates, represented

by the measurement of the latent heat of condensation relative to the adsorption of an Ar

monolayer on graphite: -119

±

2 meV/atom.44 It is also close to the ”best estimate” (ob-

tained from a combination of experimental and theoretical, mainly semiempirically-based,

data) reported in the milestone review paper by Vidali et al.,45 that is -99

4 meV. Our

±

DFT/vdW-WF2-x(PBE) computed Ar-graphite equilibrium distance is instead somehow
larger than that reported in other theoretical studies42,43 (3.3 ˚A), and also than the ”best

estimate” by Vidali et al.45 of 3.1
±
0.1 ˚A, see ref. 45). However one sould observe that an accurate estimate of this quantity is

0.1 ˚A (and an old experimental measurement of 3.2

±

more diﬃcult due to the relatively shallow potential energy curve of this system.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have presented a new method for including van der Waals (vdW) interac-

tions in Density Functional Theory using the MLWFs, which is free from empirical parame-

ters. With respect to the previous DFT/vdW-WF2 method, in the present DFT/vdW-WF2-

x approach, the empirical, short-range, damping function is replaced by an estimate of the

Pauli exchange repulsion, also obtained by the MLWFs properties. Applications to systems

contained in the popular S22 molecular database and to the case of an Ar atom interacting

with graphite, and comparison with reference data, indicate that the new method, besides

being more physically founded, also leads to a systematic improvement in the description of

vdW-bonded systems.
