ABSTRACT

Aims. We performed a systematic study of 12 active regions (ARs) with a broad range of areas, magnetic ﬂux and associated solar
activity in order to determine whether there are upﬂows present at the AR boundaries and if these upﬂows exist, whether there is a
high speed asymmetric blue wing component present in the upﬂows.
Methods. To identify the presence and locations of the AR upﬂows we derive relative Doppler velocity maps by ﬁtting a Gaussian
function to Hinode/EIS Fe XII 192.394 Å line proﬁles. To determine whether there is a high speed asymmetric component present in
the AR upﬂows we ﬁt a double Gaussian function to the Fe XII 192.394 Å mean spectrum that is computed in a region of interest
situated in the AR upﬂows.
Results. Upﬂows are observed at both the east and west boundaries of all ARs in our sample with average upﬂow velocities ranging
between -5 to -26 km s−1. A blue wing asymmetry is present in every line proﬁle. The intensity ratio between the minor high speed
asymmetric Gaussian component compared to the main component is relatively small for the majority of regions however, in a
minority of cases (8/30) the ratios are large and range between 20 to 56 %.
Conclusions. These results suggest that upﬂows and the high speed asymmetric blue wing component are a common feature of all
ARs.

1. Introduction

Identifying the origin of the slow speed (∼500 km s−1) solar wind
and determining the structure and dynamics at its sources are
amongst the most important goals of current research in helio-
physics. With the recent launch of Parker Solar Probe (Müller
et al. 2020) and Solar Orbiter (Fox et al. 2016) there is great in-
terest in connecting observations made in-situ in the solar wind
with remote sensing measurements of the source regions. As part
of that eﬀort, characterizing the physical properties of potential
source regions is important.

Previous observations from the Hinode satellite (Kosugi
et al. 2007) have shown that high temperature upﬂows are
present at the boundaries of many solar active regions (Sakao
et al. 2007; Harra et al. 2008; Del Zanna 2008; Tian et al.
2021). These upﬂows may be outﬂows if they have access to
open magnetic ﬁelds that connect to the heliosphere (Sakao
et al. 2007; Harra et al. 2008; Doschek et al. 2008; Baker et al.
2009) and elemental abundance measurements show that they
have a coronal composition (Brooks & Warren 2011). More pre-
cisely, the upﬂowing material may be a source of the slow solar
wind. Brooks et al. (2015) found, by using full-sun composition
and Doppler maps along with the potential-ﬁeld source-surface
(PFSS) model, that the primary source contributing to the slow
solar wind does appear to originate from the boundaries of active
regions. Conversely, by using a global potential ﬁeld model, Ed-
wards et al. (2016) determined that active region upﬂows were

not associated with open magnetic ﬁelds. However, the study
by Edwards et al. (2016) only concentrated on analysing up-
ﬂows present in a limited number of active regions. Furthermore,
plasma that is conﬁned along closed magnetic ﬁeld could also
contribute to the slow solar wind indirectly if it can escape along
open magnetic ﬁeld through reconnection. The Hinode Review
Team et al. (2019) describe the current state of active region out-
ﬂow studies within the wider context of solar wind research. For
a more general review of solar wind studies see, e.g., Abbo et al.
(2016).

Typical bulk ﬂow speeds measured in the upﬂows by the
EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS, Culhane et al. 2007) are 10–
40 km s−1 with mass motions of 30–60 km s−1 (Brooks & War-
ren 2011), but there is often a high speed asymmetric compo-
nent in the blue wing of the EIS spectral line proﬁles. This high
speed component is weak, with the intensity only amounting to
around 10% of the total emission of the upﬂow (Brooks & War-
ren 2012). This letter focuses on key questions about these up-
ﬂows and asymmetries.

Browsing the EIS database leaves the impression that the up-
ﬂows are present in most active regions, but selection eﬀects may
play a role in this. For example, Hinode generally observes the
largest, most active targets, and there is often a delay between
the emergence of a new active region, and its selection for ob-
servations. Furthermore, since observing the emergence phase is
diﬃcult, the formation of the upﬂows is often missed. If this is

a quick process, it might well be the case that upﬂows exist for
most of the lifetime of an active region (Démoulin et al. 2013;
Zangrilli & Poletto 2016; Baker et al. 2017; Harra et al. 2017). In
contrast, we know that the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld aﬀects
how an active region decays and ﬁnally disperses (Baker et al.
2015; van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015), so at some point this
process will aﬀect the magnetic ﬁeld at the active region bound-
ary and potentially disrupt the upﬂows.

The high speed component of the EIS line proﬁles has also
received much attention but has only been observed in a rela-
tively small number of case studies. Asymmetries are seen in
and around the footpoints of coronal loops (Hara et al. 2008;
Bryans et al. 2010; Tian et al. 2021), and have also been linked
with chromospheric jets (De Pontieu et al. 2009). The magnitude
of the asymmetries appears to depend on temperature and they
are often more pronounced in the upﬂows (Brooks & Warren
2012), but many of these results are known from the analysis of
single active regions. Since the asymmetries are weak and mea-
surements are diﬃcult there may also be a tendency to analyze
examples with a strong signal. This could potentially be mislead-
ing.

Here we perform the ﬁrst systematic study of 12 active re-
gions, three of which are observed for a second time later in
their evolution, in order to answer two questions: (i) are up-
ﬂows present in all sizes of active regions, and (ii) if upﬂows
are present, is there always a high speed blue wing asymmetry
in the high temperature line proﬁles?

The 12 active regions we study cover a range of activity
levels and conditions. They have previously been analyzed for
diﬀerent purposes by Warren et al. (2012), Brooks & Warren
(2016), and Viall & Klimchuk (2017), so we already know a
great deal about them. The total unsigned magnetic ﬂux spans
a factor of ∼7 (4.08×1021–2.73×1022 Mx), and the active region
area varies by a factor of ∼5 (2.87×1019–1.48×1020 cm2). The
emission measure distributions in the cores of the active regions
are generally strongly peaked near 4 MK, with a tendency to be
steeper for the regions of stronger magnetic ﬂux. Mass motions
in the active region core loops are typically modest (∼17 km s−1).
There is evidence of widespread cooling from high temperatures
in all these regions (Viall & Klimchuk 2017). Only one of the
active regions is in close proximity to a coronal hole therefore,
there is little possibility of interactions between the active region
boundaries and neighbouring coronal holes. PFSS extrapolations
of the regions, however, show that there is open magnetic ﬁeld
present at one or both of the active region boundaries for seven
out of twelve active regions. These regions of open ﬁeld are lo-
cated close to the areas of upﬂow we analyze. This suggests that
for these regions the upﬂows are indeed outﬂows however, this
requires further investigation.

2. Observations and Methods

Table 1 gives information on the NOAA ARs and their disk loca-
tion, along with the EIS observations we used for this analysis.
The EIS data were processed using the standard eis_prep proce-
dure available in SolarSoft. This routine accounts for the CCD
dark current and pedestal, and handles dusty, hot, and warm pix-
els and cosmic rays. For this study, however, we did not apply
the photometric calibration. Previous work has shown that ap-
plying the calibration modiﬁes the spectral line width (Brooks &
Warren 2016; Testa et al. 2016), and since this is a crucial pa-
rameter for studying the shape of the line proﬁle we decided to
use the raw uncalibrated spectra.

EIS observes two wavelength bands from 171–212 Å and
245–291 Å. The spectral resolution of the instrument is 22 mÅ.
The datasets listed in Table 1 were obtained in a variety of ob-
serving modes using both the 1(cid:48)(cid:48) and 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slits and exposure times
of 30–60 s. A ﬁeld-of-view of 100–360(cid:48)(cid:48) was scanned in the
solar-X direction while a slit height (in solar-Y) of 240–512(cid:48)(cid:48)
was used. Speciﬁc details for each dataset were provided by
Brooks & Warren (2016).

We use the Fe XII 192.394 Å spectral line for this analysis.
This is the second strongest, clean and unblended line in EIS ac-
tive region spectra (Young et al. 2007; Brown et al. 2008) and is
present in all our datasets. The line is formed at 1.6 MK in equi-
librium conditions, and this is a good representative temperature
for measuring upﬂows based on previous studies. To derive rel-
ative Doppler velocities from the Fe XII 192.394 Å line we ﬁrst
remove the orbital drift of the EIS spectrum on the CCD using
the neural network model of Kamio et al. (2010). This method
uses instrument temperature information to model the drift of
the Fe XII 195.119 Å line as the satellite moves around its or-
bit. Since the Fe XII 192.394 Å and Fe XII 195.119 Å lines are
very close in wavelength the orbital correction for one should be
valid for the other. In some cases we also apply an additional
correction to account for any residual orbital variation that was
not removed (see, e.g., Brooks et al. 2020). To create relative
Doppler velocity maps we ﬁt a Gaussian function to the Fe XII
192.394 Å spectrum across each of the scans. These maps al-
low us to easily identify upﬂow locations and determine whether
they exist in every AR.

There are multiple methods that can be used to analyse the
high-speed asymmetric component such as a double Gaussian
ﬁt (Peter 2010; Bryans et al. 2010; Brooks & Warren 2012),
blue-red (B-R) asymmetry analysis (De Pontieu et al. 2009; Tian
et al. 2011), and the B-R guided double Gaussian ﬁt (De Pon-
tieu & McIntosh 2010; Tian et al. 2011) . In this study, to assess
whether a high-speed asymmetric component is present in the Fe
XII 192.394 Å line proﬁle, we use a double Gaussian function.
We ﬁrst select a region of interest in the upﬂow and calculate
the mean spectrum. We then ﬁt a single Gaussian function and
use that to construct a double Gaussian template. The minor high
speed component is assumed to have 10% of the intensity of the
main component, and both Gaussians are assumed to have the
same width. The centroid of the minor component is initially
placed in the blue wing with a Doppler shift of 125 km s−1. This
value is based on the results from Brooks & Warren (2012); of
course the ﬁt itself determines the actual Doppler shift. The as-
sumption that the two components have the same width may not
perfectly capture the smooth shape of the asymmetry, but it pro-
vides a consistent way of quantifying e.g. the area of the minor
component compared to the main component across all the dif-
ferent ARs.

3. Results

Figures 1 and 2 show examples of the AR upﬂows and the asym-
metric blue wing component present in the EIS Fe XII 192.394 Å
spectral line for ARs 11150 and 11193 (no. 6 and 10 in Table 1).
The middle panels of both Figures show the EIS Fe XII image
along with the Doppler velocity maps of the ARs that have been
derived using the methods outlined in Section 2. The Doppler ve-
locity maps show that there are upﬂows (blue shifts) present at
the east and west boundaries of both ARs. The upﬂows are par-
ticularly strong at the solar west boundary of AR 11150 whereas,
the strongest upﬂow for AR 11193 is located at the east bound-

west boundaries in the Doppler maps for each AR in our sam-
ple.

The mean spectral proﬁle is given in the ﬁnal panels of Fig-
ures 1 and 2 for the pixels indicated by the black boxes in the
Doppler maps (middle panel). Each spectral proﬁle shows a blue
wing asymmetry. This high speed asymmetric component is rel-
atively weak although, its strength varies depending upon the
upﬂow and selected region. We found that these blue wing asym-

metries were present in all of the line proﬁles constructed from
the regions of interest located in the AR upﬂows.

Figure 3 shows the intensity ratio of the asymmetric and
main component Gaussians as a function of the average velocity
calculated for the regions of interest for the east and west up-
ﬂows for each AR. The average velocities have been shifted by
-5 km s−1 to account for the formation temperature of the Fe XII
line (see Figure 6 of Peter & Judge 1999).

larities of the AR observations given in Table 1. The actual and
true errors in the average velocities are found to be ± 4.63 km s−1
and ± 4.88 km s−1 and are calculated by taking the standard de-
viation of the average velocities with and without the additional
residual orbital correction, discussed in Section 2, respectively.
Figure 3 shows that the average velocities for the region of inter-
est in each AR upﬂow are negative and the blue wing asymmet-
ric component is present in all ARs. There is a moderately strong
negative correlation (Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of -0.58) be-
tween the intensity ratio of the minor asymmetric compared to
the main component and the associated average velocity, though
these quantities are not always independent. The average veloc-

ities for the AR upﬂows were found to be in the range of -5
to -26 km s−1. For the majority of the upﬂows the intensity of
the minor high speed component is relatively small i.e. less than
20% of the main component, however, for eight of the upﬂows
the intensity ratio ranges from 20 to 56%. In these cases the
asymmetric component is rather broad due to the assumptions
that have been made regarding the double Gaussian template. We
have also found a moderate positive correlation between the total
unsigned ﬂux of the active regions and the intensity ratio (Pear-
son correlation coeﬃcient of 0.49). The relative intensity varies
widely depending upon the location of the upﬂow i.e. whether
we are considering the upﬂow situated at the boundary of the
leading or following polarity and the stage of evolution of the
active region. Similarly, these variations are also observed for
the intensity ratio as a function of average velocity, as shown
in Figure 3. Finally, no correlation was found between the total
unsigned magnetic ﬂux and the average upﬂow velocity.

4. Summary & Discussion

We carried out a systematic study using the EIS observations
of 12 active regions in order to determine: (i) whether upﬂows
exist in all sizes of active regions and if so (ii) is there always a
high speed blue wing asymmetry present in the Fe XII 192.394 Å
line proﬁle. The ARs in our sample spanned a wide range of
total unsigned magnetic ﬂux (4.08 × 1021 – 2.73 ×1022 Mx) and
areas (2.87 ×1019 – 1.48 × 1021 cm2). Three of our ARs were
observed for a second time roughly 2 to 4 days after the initial
EIS observations, giving a sample of 15 AR measurements in our
study. By creating Doppler velocity maps from the EIS scans of
each AR it was possible to identify whether upﬂows were present
in each AR and their locations. We found that these upﬂows were
present at the east and west boundaries of all ARs in our sample.
This suggests that upﬂows at the boundary are a common feature

of ARs irrespective of their size. The average velocities for the
regions of interest located in the AR upﬂows were found to be
between -5 and -26 km s−1.

Baker et al. (2017) also reported large-scale upﬂows ob-
served at the peripheries of both polarities in a sample of 10
ARs with similar ﬂux range to the ARs in this work. They found
that the majority of the long-term evolution of the upﬂows is at-
tributed to projection eﬀects that are dependent upon the AR’s
location on the disk. This eﬀect is stronger in ARs associated
with higher velocities. In this study, we have analysed EIS scans
of ARs that were taken at numerous longitudes ranging between
-492.6(cid:48)(cid:48) and 406.0(cid:48)(cid:48) and so projection eﬀects will be present. In
fact, there is a signiﬁcant change in the upﬂows and intensity of
the blue wing asymmetries after approximately 2 to 4 days for
three ARs (11082, 11190, 11339 in Table 1) that were observed
by EIS more than once. However, in this particular study, we are
only interested in whether these upﬂows and asymmetries are
present at the peripheries of ARs and not their evolution.

To determine whether a high speed asymmetric component
exists in the Fe XII 192.394 Å spectral line we used a double
Gaussian function, which was based upon the mean spectrum
calculated for a region of interest located in the upﬂows. We then
measured the intensity of the minor asymmetric component to
the main component for all ARs. While, we acknowledge that in
some cases, by using a double Gaussian ﬁt with two components,
the width does not entirely capture the shape of the blue wing
asymmetry it provides a way to consistently compare the area
of the minor and main components. Furthermore, comparisons
with artiﬁcial line proﬁles support this analysis strategy (Tian
et al. 2011). An alternative method would be to use an asym-
metric Gaussian ﬁt where the degree of asymmetry comes from
the diﬀerence in the widths between the Gaussians that ﬁt the
red and blue wings, or to follow the (B-R) asymmetry analysis
introduced by De Pontieu et al. (2009). Diﬀerences in method-
ology however, do not change our fundamental results because
the blue wing asymmetries were discovered to be present in each
AR. This indicates that these asymmetries are likely to be present
in all ARs. For most of our ARs the intensity of the high speed
component compared to the main component is quite small with
an intensity ratio of up to 20%. Although, for eight upﬂows the
ratio of intensities are between 20 to 56%.

We also found indications of moderate negative (positive)
correlations between the intensity ratio of the minor asymmetric
and main components, and the average upﬂow velocities (total
unsigned magnetic ﬂux). However, the upﬂow velocity can vary
signiﬁcantly depending upon the location of the upﬂow there-
fore, projection eﬀects are potentially important. This requires
full EIS coverage of the active regions. Other considerations
need to be taken into account such as the size and locations of
the selected regions of interest and the fact that sizeable asym-
metric components will shift a single Gaussian to the blue wing
and will give larger Doppler velocities.

Prior observations have suggested that the upﬂows located
at the boundaries of ARs, and the high speed component, are
likely to be a source of the slow solar wind. The fact that they
are present in all ARs suggests that their contribution could be
signiﬁcant. Previous studies have tried to link these features to
in-situ measurements of the solar wind, and currently, we are
investigating their role in the production of solar energetic par-
ticles (SEPs). Plasma composition measurements are important
for SEP connection studies (Brooks & Yardley 2021) and fur-
ther work on this topic will be the focus of missions such as So-
lar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe. In fact, Harra et al. (2021)
have already analysed a series of small type III bursts observed

by Parker Solar Probe in order to identify the source of SEPs.
They found that the most likely source of the radio storm was
an extended blue-shifted outﬂow region located at the eastern
boundary of an expanding active region.
