Abstract
In this paper we investigate the possibility of searching for the hidden - bottom pentaquark
states in photon – induced interactions at the LHC. We consider the presence of the Pb resonance
in the s – channel of the γp → Υp reaction and estimate its contribution for the exclusive Υ
photoproduction in the ﬁxed - target mode of the LHC. Predictions for the total cross sections,
rapidity and transverse momentum distributions are derived using the STARlight Monte Carlo
considering P b − p, P b − He and P b − Ar ﬁxed - target collisions at the LHC. Our results indicate
that the presence of the Pb resonance implies an enhancement in the rapidity distribution in the
kinematical range covered by the LHCb detector. We demonstrate that the Pb contribution for
the Υ photoproduction becomes dominant if kinematical cuts are imposed on the rapidity and
transverse momentum of the ﬁnal state. These results indicate that an experimental analysis of
the Υ photoproduction in ﬁxed – target collisions can provide complementary and independent
checks of the existence of these states, and help to understand their underlying nature.

INTRODUCTION

√

In the last years many exotic hadrons, which are states which does not appear to ﬁt with
the expectations for an ordinary q ¯q or qqq hadrons in the quark model, have been observed
[1, 2]). Such results have
at various experimental facilities (For reviews see, e.g., Refs.
motivated a series of studies focused on the description of the internal structure of the exotic
hadrons as well as the proposition of new channels to search and constrain the properties
In particular, the study of hidden - heavy quark pentaquark states has
of these states.
received a lot of attention (See e.g. Refs. [3–16]), strongly motivated by the results reported
by the LHCb Collaboration for the Λ0
b → J/ΨpK − decay, which indicate the existence of
three narrow pentaquark states: Pc(4312), Pc(4440) and Pc(4457) [17]. Such observation
was conﬁrmed by the D0 Collaboration, which have analyzed the production of these states
in p¯p collisions [18] and found an enhancement in the J/Ψp invariant mass consistent with
a sum of the resonances Pc(4440) and Pc(4457) reported by the LHCb Collaboration. On
the other hand, the GlueX Collaboration at the Thomas Jeﬀerson National Accelerator
Facility (JLab) did not see evidence for them [19], which implies an upper limit on the
branching ratios B(Pc → J/Ψp).
In addition, the nature of these states is still a theme
of intense debate. One of the most promising alternatives to probe the existence and to
decipher the nature of these states is the study of the photoproduction of the Pc state in
the γp → J/Ψp reaction at low center – of - mass energies (
s ≤ 20 GeV) [16] , which can
be realized experimentally at JLab and in the future electron - ion collider in China (EicC)
[20] 1. Another possibility is to study the exclusive J/Ψ photoproduction in ﬁxed - target
collisions at the LHC [21]. In recent years, the study of ﬁxed - target collisions at the LHC
became a reality [22] and an comprehensive ﬁxed - target program using the LHC beams
is expected to be developed in forthcoming years [23]. As shown in Ref.
[21], the ﬁxed -
target collisions allows to probe the photon - induced interactions in a limited energy range,
dominated by low - energy interactions, which is the region of interest for the study of the
Pc production. Such aspect was explored in Ref. [14], which have investigated the impact
of the Pc resonances on the J/Ψ photoproduction at the LHC and demonstrated that the
presence of the resonances modiﬁes the associated rapidity distribution in the rapidity range
probed by the LHCb detector. As a consequence, future experimental analysis of ﬁxed –
target collisions are expected to improve our understanding of the properties of the Pc states.
In this paper we will extend the analysis performed in Ref. [14] for the case of hidden –
bottom pentaquark states, denoted Pb hereafter, which can contribute for the exclusive Υ
photoproduction in ﬁxed - target collisions at the LHC. Such states were not yet observed
and are expected to be formed by three light quarks and a bottom quark pair. Distinctly
from the Pc states, the Pb states cannot be produced through the decay of heavier baryons,
which motivates the investigation of its direct production in hadronic and photon – induced
interactions (See e.g. Refs. [12, 24]). We will focus on ultraperipheral heavy – ion collisions
[25], which are characterized by large impact parameter b > Rh1 + Rh2 (Rhi is the hadron
radius). For this case, the photon – induced interactions become dominant and hadronic
collisions can be used to study the production of the Pb states in the γh → Υh reaction. In
our analysis we will extend previous studies for the exclusive Υ photoproduction in hadronic
collisions at the LHC, which estimated the contribution of the Pomeron exchange in the t
– channel for the cross section [represented in Fig. 1 (a)], by taking into account the

contribution associated to the presence of the Pb resonances in the s – channel [See Fig. 1
(b)]. In our analysis the contribution associated to the Pomeron exchange will be estimated
using the STARlight Monte Carlo [26], which successfully describe the main aspects of the
photon - induced interactions at the LHC (See e.g. Refs. [27–32]). On the other hand, we
will estimate the s – channel contribution using the approach proposed in Ref. [12], which
we have implemented in the STARLight MC. The exclusive Υ photoproduction cross section
will be estimated considering the contribution of both channels for P b − p, Ar − p, P b − Ar
and P b − He ﬁxed target collisions at the LHC and our predictions for the rapidity and

indicate that the study of the Υ photoproduction in ﬁxed – target collisions can be useful
to probe the existence of the Pb pentaquark states.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next Section a brief review of formalism needed
to describe the Υ photoproduction via the diagrams presented in Fig. 1. In Section III, we
will present our predictions for the total cross sections and associated rapidity and transverse
distributions considering a projectile P b beam and diﬀerent nuclei as ﬁxed target. Finally,
in Section IV we will summarize our main results and conclusions.

II. FORMALISM

In what follows we will present a brief review of the formalism needed to describe the
exclusive Υ photoproduction in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs). In UPCs, the photon –
induced interactions become dominant and the hadronic cross sections can be factorized in
terms of the equivalent ﬂux of photons of the incident hadrons and the photon-photon or
photon-target cross section. We will focus on photon – hadron interactions, where the photon
stemming from the electromagnetic ﬁeld of one of the two hadrons interact directly with the
other hadron [25]. In this case, the cross section for the exclusive Υ photoproduction can
be expressed by,

(cid:90)

dω nh1(ω) σγh2→V h2 (Wγh2) +

(1)
where
s is center-of-mass energy for the h1h2 collision (hi = p,A), ω is the energy of
the photon emitted by the hadron and nh is the equivalent photon ﬂux of the hadron
h integrated over the impact parameter. Moreover, σγh→V h describes the vector meson
production in photon - hadron interactions, which will be given in our analysis by the sum
of the contributions associated to the Pomeron exchange and Pb resonances. Following
Ref. [26], the Pomeron contribution for photon – proton interactions will be described by a
parameterization inspired in the Regge theory given by

with σIP = 6.4 pb and (cid:15) = 0.74 being derived ﬁtting the HERA data [33] and the term in
parenthesis describes the behaviour of the cross section for energies near to the threshold
of production. On the other hand, in order to estimate the contribution associated to the
Pb resonance, denoted by σPc
γp→Υp, we follow the approach proposed in Ref. [12], where the
photoproduction of the Pb states is estimated within the framework of an eﬀective Lagrangian
approach combined with the vector meson dominance assumption [34]. In this approach,
the Lagrangians needed to estimated to estimate the photon – nucleon cross section are
expressed by

where N , A, Pb and Υ characterize the nucleon, photon, Pb state and Υ meson ﬁelds,
respectively. Moreover, gPbΥN is the Pb − Υ − N coupling constant, which can be estimated
from the ΓPb→ΥN decay width, and eh is the electromagnetic coupling related to γN Pb
−,
vertex. As in Refs. [12, 13], we will assume that the Pb state is characterized by J P = 1
2
M = 11080 MeV and ΓPb→ΥN = 0.38 MeV. In addition, we assume gPbΥN = 0.074 and
eh = 0.00016. The resulting σPc
γp→Υp cross section has been implemented in the STARLight
MC. Finally, for a nuclear target, we will disregard the nuclear eﬀects and assume that
σγA→ΥA = A × σγp→Υp. One has that for the light targets considered in this paper, this is a
reasonable approximation, since the Υ state is a compact object, with negligible interactions
with the nuclear medium.

In order to estimate the cross section, Eq. (1), we must specify the photon spectrum
associated to protons and nuclei. In our analysis, we use the approach proposed in Refs.
[26, 35], which is implemented in the STARlight MC. In this approach, the photon spectrum
is calculated as follows

(cid:90)

n(ω) =

d2b PN H(b) N (ω, b) ,

where PN H(b) is the probability of not having a hadronic interaction at impact parameter
b and the number of photons per unit area, per unit energy, derived assuming a point-like
form factor, is given by

where ζ ≡ ωb/γ and K0(ζ) and K1(ζ) are the modiﬁed Bessel functions. For nuclear
collisions, one has that PN H(b) = exp[−σN N TAA(b)], where σN N is the nucleon - nucleon
interaction cross section and TAA(b) is the nuclear overlap function, which is assumed to be
the convolution of a hard sphere potential with a Yukawa potential of range 0.7 fm. On the
other hand, for proton - nucleus collisions, PN H(b) = exp[−σN N TA(b)], where TA(b) is the
nuclear thickness function (For details see Ref. [26]).

III. RESULTS

√

In what follows we will present our estimates for the exclusive Υ photoproduction in
s = 110 GeV and 69 GeV, respectively, assuming
ﬁxed - target P b − A collisions at
A = p, He, Ar. For comparison, we also will present results for Ar − p collisions. We will
restrict our analysis to the Υ(1S) state, but the results can be easily extended for excited
states. Moreover, we will consider the full LHC kinematical range as well as the kinematical
range probed by the LHCb detector. In the latter case, we select the events in which the
vector meson is produced in the rapidity range 2 ≤ y ≤ 4.5.

Moreover,
one has that distinctly from the predictions for the collider mode presented e.g. in Ref. [36],
the maximum of the distributions occur in ﬁxed - target collisions for forward rapidities.
In particular, it occurs in the kinematical range probed by the LHCb detector. One has
that the contribution of the Pb resonance implies the presence of two peaks in the rapidity
distribution. Such result is expected. For a ﬁxed value of rapidity y, such distribution is
determined by the sum of two terms, the ﬁrst one being determined by the γh cross section
∝ e−y [See Eq.
for W 2
(1)]. Therefore, the resonance condition, Wγh ≈ M , is satisﬁed for two distinct values of
rapidity. Moreover, we have that the magnitude of the peak is larger when the photon is
emitted by the P b beam, which is also expected, since the photon ﬂux is proportional to
Z 2. One very important aspect, is that the highest peak is predicted to occur in the range
probed by the LHCb detector, with its contribution for the Υ photoproduction being larger
than that associated to the Pomeron exchange. Therefore, our results indicate that a future
experimental analysis of ﬁxed - target collisions by the LHCb detector can be very useful to
probe the existence and properties of the Pb resonance.

In Fig. 3 we present our predictions for the transverse momentum distribution associated
to the exclusive Υ photoproduction in P bAr collisions at
s = 110 GeV. Similar results are
obtained for other conﬁgurations of projectile and target. The predictions for the Pomeron
and P b resonance are presented separately. For the Pomeron contribution, one has that pT
spectrum of the vector meson is determined by the sum of the photon momentum with the
exchanged momentum in the interaction between the vector meson and the target. While
the photon momentum is deﬁned by the equivalent photon approximation, the exchanged
one is determined by the form factor of the target. As both the photon and scattering trans-
verse momenta are small, we expect that the meson pT spectrum associated to the Pomeron
exchange will be dominated by small values of transverse momentum, being strongly sup-
pressed at large p2
T . This behaviour is observed in Fig. 3. On the other hand, the spectrum
associated to the Pb contribution is characterized by vector mesons with larger transverse
momentum. Such result indicates that the Pomeron contribution can be strongly suppressed
selecting the events with pT ≥ 0.4 GeV.

Finally, our predictions for the total cross sections are presented in Table I considering
diﬀerent rapidity ranges and

being presented in parenthesis. As expected, the Pomeron contribution is strongly energy
dependent, since σIP ∝ W (cid:15)
γp. Moreover, one has that the cross section increases with atomic
number of the particles that interact due to the factor Z 2 factor present in the nuclear
photon ﬂux. In agreement with the results presented in Fig. 2, the selection of the LHCb
rapidity range reduces the magnitude of the cross sections, being this suppression larger for
the Pomeron contribution in P b−Ar collisions. Our results indicate that the Pb contribution
is not negligible for the Υ photoproduction in the kinematical range covered by the LHCb
detector. It is important to emphasize that this contribution becomes dominant if we select
the events in the rapidity range 2.0 ≤ y ≤ 2.7, as demonstrated in the last two lines of Table
I. Such results indicate that the separation of the Pb contribution in a future experimental
analysis is, in principle, feasible.

IV. SUMMARY

In recent years, the study of photon - induced interactions in hadronic colliders has allow
us to improve our understanding about the partonic structure of hadrons. In this paper, we
have proposed to search for the Pb resonance in the exclusive Υ photoproduction considering
ﬁxed - target collisions at the LHC. Our analysis is strongly motivated by the proposition
of the AFTER@LHC experiment and by the study of beam - gas interactions, recently
performed by the LHCb detector, as well by recent theoretical studies that demonstrated that
the study of the exclusive vector meson photoproduction is feasible in the ﬁxed - target mode.
We have estimated the total cross sections, rapidity and transverse momentum distributions
for the exclusive Υ photoproduction considering diﬀerent conﬁgurations of projectile and
s = 110 and 69 GeV. The Pomeron and Pb resonance contributions
target and assuming
were estimated using the STARlight Monte Carlo, which allowed to take into account some
typical LHCb requirements for the selection of exclusive events. Our goal was to verify if the
study of this process can be useful to probe the existence of the Pb resonance. We shown that
the presence of the resonance modiﬁes the associated rapidity distribution due to the large
enhancement of the γp → Υp cross section near the threshold. We have demonstrated that

that events associated to the Pb contribution can be separated by imposing additional cuts
on the rapidity range and transverse momentum of the vector meson. Finally, our results
indicate that the study of the exclusive Υ photoproduction in ﬁxed - target collisions at the
LHC provide a complementary and independent probe of the hidden - bottom pentaquark
states, and a future experimental analysis will be useful to understand their underlying
nature.
