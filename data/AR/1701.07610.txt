ABSTRACT

Connecting in-situ measured solar-wind plasma properties with typical regions on the Sun can provide
an eﬀective constraint and test to various solar wind models. We examine the statistical characteristics
of the solar wind with an origin in diﬀerent types of source regions. We ﬁnd that the speed distribution
of coronal hole (CH) wind is bimodal with the slow wind peaking at ∼400 km s−1 and a fast at
∼600 km s−1. An anti-correlation between the solar wind speeds and the O7+/O6+ ion ratio remains
valid in all three types of solar wind as well during the three studied solar cycle activity phases, i.e.
solar maximum, decline and minimum. The NF e/NO range and its average values all decrease with
the increasing solar wind speed in diﬀerent types of solar wind. The NF e/NO range (0.06–0.40, FIP
bias range 1–7) for AR wind is wider than for CH wind (0.06–0.20, FIP bias range 1–3) while the
minimum value of NF e/NO (∼ 0.06) does not change with the variation of speed, and it is similar
for all source regions. The two-peak distribution of CH wind and the anti-correlation between the
speed and O7+/O6+ in all three types of solar wind can be explained qualitatively by both the wave-
turbulence-driven (WTD) and reconnection-loop-opening (RLO) models, whereas the distribution
features of NF e/NO in diﬀerent source regions of solar wind can be explained more reasonably by the
RLO models.

1. INTRODUCTION
It is common knowledge that the in-situ solar wind has two basic components: a steady fast (∼800 km s−1) and a
variable slow (∼400 km s−1) component (e.g. Schwenn 2006, and the references therein). While it is widely accepted
that the fast solar wind (FSW) originates in coronal holes (Krieger et al. 1973; Zirker 1977; Gosling & Pizzo 1999), the
source regions of the slow solar wind (SSW) are still poorly understood. One of the sources of the SSW has been linked
to sources at the edges of active regions (e.g. Kojima et al. 1999; Sakao et al. 2007; Culhane et al. 2014, etc.) and it is
also believed that the SSW originates in the quiet Sun (e.g. Woo & Habbal 2000; Feldman et al. 2005; Fu et al. 2015).
Intuitively, identiﬁcation of wind sources can be done by tracing wind parcels back to the Sun. By applying a
potential-ﬁeld-source-surface (PFSS) model, Luhmann et al. (2002) mapped a low latitude solar wind back to the
photosphere for nearly three solar activity cycles. They showed, for instance, that polar coronal holes contribute to
the solar wind only over about the half solar cycle, while for the rest of the time the low-latitude solar wind originates
from “isolated low-latitude and midlatitude coronal holes or polar coronal hole extensions that have a ﬂow character
distinct from that of the large polar hole ﬂows”. Using a standard two-step mapping procedure, Neugebauer et al.
(2002) traced solar wind parcels back to the solar surface for four Carrington rotations during a solar maximum phase.
The solar wind was divided into two categories: coronal hole and active region wind, and their statistical parameters
were analyzed separately. The authors reported that the O7+/O6+ ion ratio is lower for the coronal-hole wind in
comparison to the active-region wind. Fu et al. (2015) traced the solar wind back to its sources and classiﬁed the solar
wind by the type of the source region, i.e. active region (AR), quiet Sun (QS) and coronal hole (CH) wind. They
found that the fractions occupied by each type of solar wind change with the solar cycle activity and established that
the quiet Sun regions are an important source of the solar wind during the solar minimum phase.

Alternatively, wind sources can be determined by examining in-situ charge states and elemental abundances. For

the former, the charge states of species such as oxygen and carbon are regarded as a telltale signature of the solar wind
ionic charge state ratio, hereafter O7+/O6+) does
sources. For example, the density ratio of n(O7+) to n(O6+) (i.e.
not vary with the distance beyond several solar radii above the solar surface, and, therefore, it reﬂects the electron
temperature in the coronal sources (Owocki et al. 1983; Buergi & Geiss 1986). As the temperatures in diﬀerent source
regions are diﬀerent, therefore, the source regions can be identiﬁed by the charge states detected in situ (Zhao et al.
2009; Landi et al. 2012). The ﬁrst ionization potential (FIP) eﬀect describes the element anomalies in the upper solar
atmosphere and the solar wind (especially in the SSW), i.e. the abundance increase of elements with a FIP of less
than 10 eV (e.g., Mg, Si, and Fe) to those with a higher FIP (e.g., O, Ne, and He). The in-situ measured FIP bias is
usually represented by NF e/NO and it can be expressed as

F IP bias =

(NF e/NO)solar wind
(NF e/NO)photosphere

,

(1)

where NF e/NO is the abundance ratio of iron (Fe) and oxygen (O). In the slow wind the FIP bias is ∼3, while in
the fast streams it is found to be smaller but still above 1 (von Steiger et al. 2000). As the FIP bias in coronal holes,
the quiet Sun, and active regions has signiﬁcant diﬀerences, the solar wind detected in situ can be linked to those
source regions (e.g., Feldman et al. 2005; Laming 2015, and the references thererin). In the present study, we only
present the in-situ measurements of NF e/NO that can easily be translated to a FIP bias by considering NF e/NO in
the photosphere to be a constant at ∼0.06 (Asplund et al. 2009).

Two theoretical frameworks, the wave-turbulence-driven (WTD) models and the reconnection-loop-opening (RLO)
models, have been proposed to account for the observational results. In the WTD models, the magnetic funnels are
jostled by the photosphere convection, and waves are produced that propagate into the upper atmosphere. These waves
can dissipate to heat and accelerate the nascent solar wind (Hollweg 1986; Wang & Sheeley 1991; Cranmer et al. 2007;
Verdini et al. 2009). In the RLO models the magnetic-ﬁeld line of loops reconnect with open ﬁeld lines and during
this process mass and energy are released (Fisk et al. 1999; Fisk 2003; Schwadron & McComas 2003; Woo et al. 2004;
Fisk & Zurbuchen 2006). For more details on these two classes of models please see the review by Cranmer (2009).
There are two important diﬀerences between the two models. First, in the WTD models the plasma escapes directly
along open magnetic-ﬁeld lines, whereas in the RLO models the plasma is released from closed loops through magnetic
reconnection. Second, in the WTD models the speed of the solar wind is determined by the super radial expansion
(Wang & Sheeley 1990) and curvature degree (Li et al. 2011) of the open magnetic-ﬁeld lines. In the RLO models, the
speed of the solar wind depends on the temperature of the loops that reconnect with the open magnetic-ﬁeld lines
with hotter loops producing slow wind, and cooler loops producing fast wind (Fisk 2003).

Observations can be used to test any of the above mentioned models. For this purpose, the following three questions
need to be addressed. First, where do the two components (a steady fast component and a variable slow portion
(Schwenn 2006)) of the solar wind originate from? Second, why does the charge state anti-correlate with the solar
wind speed (Geiss et al. 1995; von Steiger et al. 2000; Gloeckler et al. 2003; Wang & Sheeley 2003; Wang et al. 2009)?
Third, why is the FIP bias (FIP bias value range) higher (wider) in the slow solar wind than in the fast wind (Geiss et al.
1995; von Steiger et al. 2000; Abbo et al. 2016)?

Traditionally, solar wind is classiﬁed by its speeds. The speed, however, is not the only characteristic feature of
the solar wind (Antiochos et al. 2012; Abbo et al. 2016). The plasma properties and magnetic-ﬁeld structures can be
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent depending on the solar regions, i.e. coronal holes, quiet Sun, and active regions. The diﬀerences
in the source regions would then inﬂuence the solar wind streams they generate (Feldman et al. 2005). Therefore,
connecting in-situ measured solar-wind plasma properties with typical regions on the Sun can provide an eﬀective
constraint and test to various solar wind models (Landi et al. 2014). In an earlier study, we classiﬁed the solar wind by
the source region type (CHs, QS, and ARs) (Fu et al. 2015). Here, we analyze the relationship between in-situ solar
wind parameters and source regions in diﬀerent phases of the solar cycle activity. We aim at answering the following
outstanding questions: 1) Are there any diﬀerences in the speed, O7+/O6+, and NF e/NO distributions of the diﬀerent
types of solar wind, i.e. AR, QS and CH? 2) Is the anti-correlation between the solar wind speed and O7+/O6+ charge
state still valid for each type of solar wind? 3) What are the characteristics of the distribution in speed and NF e/NO
space for the diﬀerent types of solar wind? We also discuss our new results in the light of the WTD and RLO models.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data and the analysis methods. The statistical results

are discussed in Section 3. The summary and concluding remarks are given in Section 4.

2. DATA AND ANALYSIS

3

In Fu et al. (2015), the source regions were categorized into three groups: CHs, ARs, and QS, and the wind streams
originating from these regions were given the corresponding names CH wind, AR wind, and QS wind, respectively. We
used hourly averaged solar wind speeds measured by the Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor onboard
the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE, Stone et al. 1998). The charge state O7+/O6+ and FIP bias NF e/NO (also
hourly averaged) were recorded by the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer, ( SWICS/ACE Gloeckler et al.
In the present study we are only interested in the non-transient solar wind, and therefore, the intervals
1998).
occupied by Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) were excluded. We used the method suggested by
Richardson & Cane (2004) where charge state O7+/O6+ exceeding 6.008exp(−0.00578v) (v is the ICME speed) were
discarded. In this study, the threshold for FSW and SSW is chosen as 500 km s−1 (Fu et al. 2015; Abbo et al. 2016).
The two-step mapping procedure (Neugebauer et al. 1998, 2002) was applied to trace the solar wind parcels back
to the solar surface. The footpoints were then placed on the EUV images observed by the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging
Telescope (EIT, Delaboudini`ere et al., 1995) and the photospheric magnetograms taken by the Michelson Doppler
imager (MDI, Scherrer et al. 1995) onboard SoHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, Domingo et al., 1995). Here,
the EIT 284 ˚A passband was used as coronal holes are best distinguishable there.

The scheme for classifying the source regions is illustrated in the top panels (a–d) of Figure 1 where the footpoint
locations (red crosses) are overplotted on the EIT images (a1, b1, c1, d1) and the photospheric magnetograms (a2,
b2, c2, d2). The wind with footpoints located within CHs is classiﬁed as “CH wind”. A quantitative approach which
follows that of Krista & Gallagher (2009) for identifying coronal hole boundaries is implemented. In this approach, a
rectangular box which includes apparently dark area and its brighter surrounding area is chosen. There would be a
multipeak distribution for its intensity histogram (see Figure 3 in Krista & Gallagher (2009) and Figure 2 in Fu et al.
(2015)). The minimum between the ﬁrst two peaks was deﬁned as the threshold for the CH boundary (see the green
contours in Figure 1, a1–d1). This scheme can deﬁne CH boundaries more objectively and it is not inﬂuenced by
the emission variation of the corona with the solar activity. The deﬁnition of the AR wind relies on the magnetic
ﬁeld strength at photospheric level and corresponds to magnetically concentrated areas (MCAs). MCAs conform an
area deﬁned by the value of contour levels that are 1.5–4 times the mean of the radial component of the photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld. We found that the morphology of MCA is not sensitive to contour levels if it is in the above mentioned
range. This means that the MCAs have a strong spatial gradient of the radial magnetic-ﬁeld component. The deﬁned
MCAs encompass all active regions numbered by NOAA as given by the solarmonitor 1. However, not all MCAs
correspond to an AR numbered by NOAA. As CH boundaries are deﬁned quantitatively, we need only to consider
the regions outside CHs when we identify AR and QS regions. An AR wind is deﬁned when its footpoint is located
inside an MCA that is a numbered NOAA AR. The QS wind is deﬁned when the footpoints are located outside any
MCA and CH. The regions for which a footpoint is located in MCA that is not numbered by NOAA are named as
“Undeﬁned” in order to keep the selection of the three groups solar wind “pure”. The fractions of the undeﬁned group
range from ∼ 5% to ∼ 20% for the years 2000 to 2008. More details on the background work can be found in Fu et al.
(2015).

In the present study, the temporal resolution of the data used for tracing the solar wind back to the solar surface
is enhanced to 12 hours. The data for which the polarities are inconsistent at the two ends are removed as done
in Neugebauer et al. (2002) and Fu et al. (2015). The statistical results for the solar wind parameters are almost the
same as those of Fu et al. (2015) in which the temporal resolution is 1-day. More detailed analysis shows that the
footpoints stay in a particular region (CH, AR or QS) for several days. One example is shown in Figure 1 (a1), where
a footpoint is located in the same big equatorial hole for almost 7 days. This means that a higher temporal resolution
can only inﬂuence the classiﬁcation when a footpoint lies near the edge of a certain region. The analysed data cover
the time period from 2000 to 2008 which is further divided into a solar maximum (2000–2001), decline (2002–2006),
and minimum phases (2007–2008) based on the monthly sunspot number.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Parameter distributions
To demonstrate the linkage of in-situ measured solar wind speeds, NF e/NO and O7+/O6+ to particular solar regions,
we describe in detail a randomly chosen example of a period of time with typical CH, AR, and QS wind. Figure 1
provides an illustration of the classiﬁcation scheme of the solar wind (a–d) and the solar wind parameters for the time
period from day 313 to day 361 of 2003 (e–g). The footpoint of solar wind parcel detected by ACE on day 316 is shown

in Figure 1, a1 and a2, day 336 corresponds to b1 and b2, day 341 to c1 and c2, day 346 to d1 and d2. The solar wind
was classiﬁed as CH, AR, QS and CH wind, respectively. The period of time from day 315 to day 322 and 345 to 349
show two fast solar wind streams with an average speed of ∼700 km s−1 and ∼800 km s−1. These two streams are
separated approximately 27 days during which the streams from two active regions, an equatorial coronal hole and
two quiet-Sun periods are identiﬁed. The two fastest streams are associated with a low charge state and a NF e/NO
ratio of 0.03±0.015 and 0.1±0.01, respectively. As shown in Figure 1, d1, the fast stream (from day 345 to day 349 )
originates from a big equatorial coronal hole. Thus, the start (days 342.0-343.5) and end (days 350.5 to 352.0) periods
are considered as coronal-hole-boundary origin regions. They have parameters characteristic for slow solar wind, i.e.
the charge state O7+/O6+ is 0.14±0.07 and 0.13±0.03, and NF e/NO – 0.20±0.04 and 0.14±0.01, respectively.
In
contrast to the two fastest CH streams, the AR wind has a lower speed of ∼500 km s−1 and ∼400 km s−1, and higher
O7+/O6+ and NF e/NO (0.20±0.05 and 0.29±0.05, and 0.15±0.01 and 0.14±0.02, respectively). The QS wind has
parameters comparable to the AR speeds (∼450 km s−1), O7+/O6+ (0.19±0.04 and 0.18±0.05) and NF e/NO ratios
(0.10±0.01 and 0.12±0.02). The speed, O7+/O6+ and NF e/NO ratios for the wind that originates from the equatorial
CH (day 327.5-332.5) are 524±80 km s−1, 0.10±0.04 and 0.12±0.01.

As the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations and plasma properties are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for the diﬀerent types of source
regions, we investigate here whether there also exist diﬀerences between the three sources of solar wind. In Figure 2,
we show the normalized (to the maximum for each wind type) distributions of the solar wind speed and the O7+/O6+
and NF e/NO ratios for the solar wind as a whole (in order to compare with earlier studies) and the diﬀerent source
regions, i.e. AR, QS and CH. As these parameters are expected to change with the solar activity (Lepri et al. 2013;
Fu et al. 2015), the results are shown for three diﬀerent phases of solar cycle 23. From Figure 2 (a1) we note that as
expected the average speed of the CH wind is higher than the AR and QS wind. Further, we estimated the contribution
of each of the source regions to the fast and the slow solar wind (Table 1). If the whole cycle is considered as one, the
CHs (39.3%) have just a ∼4% higher contribution to the FSW than the QS (35.5%), with ARs having the smallest
input of 25.2%. For a given solar cycle phase, however, the true contribution of each type of solar wind becomes more
evident. During the maximum phase of the solar cycle, the ARs are the dominant FSW source at 40.3% followed by
the CHs at 34.1% and the QS at 25.6%. At the time of the decline phase the CHs are prevailing at 48.2% and the
rest of the FSW input comes almost equally from the QS (24.0%) and ARs (27.8%). The most dominant during the
minimum is the QS at 64.3%. With regard to the SSW, if all the whole cycle is examined, the QS (43.7%) and ARs
(42.9%) have an almost equal contribution. At the maximum ARs are the main source of SSW at 58.8%, while in the
decline phase again the AR and QS have almost the same contribution of ∼42%. The predominant source of the SSW
during the minimum of the solar activity is the QS at 72.9%.

The fractional contribution of each wind for a given source region is shown in Table 2. Again if all solar cycle
phases together are studied, then CHs produce ∼60% FSW (∼40% SSW), ARs ∼77% SSW of their total solar wind
input, while ∼29% of the total QS contribution goes into the FSW. More interesting is, however, how the fractions
change during the diﬀerent phases of the solar cycle activity. During the maximum CH SSW rises to ∼60%, while the

CHs and MCA boundaries, respectively. The footpoints of the solar wind are denoted by red crosses. The solar wind detected
by ACE is classiﬁed as CH wind (a1, a2 and d1, d2), AR wind (b1, b2) and QS wind (c1, c2). Bottom panels: Solar wind

the black lines represent the days during which there is no EUV image taken by EIT. The vertical lines represent the solar wind

solar main contribution of ARs and QS (of more than ∼80%) is to the SSW. In the decline phase the CH produces

6

more FSW (∼64%) than SSW (∼36%). Again the ARs and QS are predominantly contributing to the SSW at a bit
more than ∼70% of their total wind contribution. During the minimum the CH FSW contribution decreases slightly
to ∼58% while the emission of SSW grows to ∼42%. In the minimum the FSW contribution of the ARs and QS goes
further up to 34% and 37%, respectively, while their SSW contribution decrease.
It is important to point out that
the above results only reﬂect the wind detected by ACE which lies in the ecliptic plane. Also we have to note that the
heliospheric structures (such as neutral line and heliospheric current sheet) which may inﬂuence the statistical results
were not removed during the investigated years. Usually, those structures are associated with the boundaries between
diﬀerent source regions of the solar wind (Neugebauer et al. 2002).

Case and statistical studies have already shown that CHs are sources of both the fast and slow wind (Neugebauer et al.
2002; Ko et al. 2014). Woo & Habbal (2000) compared the ﬂow speed derived from Doppler dimming and density
observations by UVCS/SoHO (UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer) and suggested that the QS regions are an
additional source of the fast solar wind, thus questioning the traditional belief that the fast solar wind originates
only from CHs. There are many small regions (size of several arcsec across) in a typical QS region that are similar
in brightness to CH regions as observed in, for instance, coronal spectral lines Ne viii (Tmax ∼ 6×105 K) and Mg x
(Tmax ∼ 106 K) (from SUMER), as well as EIT and TRACE coronal solar-disk images. Thus, Feldman et al. (2005)
speculated that those dark QS regions may be the source regions of the fast solar wind suggested by Woo & Habbal
(2000).
In the present study, the solar wind is classiﬁed by source regions which diﬀers from classiﬁcations that are
based on solar wind parameters (such as solar wind speed and charge state O7+/O6+) (Zhao et al. 2009; Landi et al.
2012). Bearing the uncertainties of our solar-wind classiﬁcation scheme as discussed in Fu et al. (2015) (such as the
reliability of the PFSS model and the simple ballistic treatment in the mapping procedure), our results demonstrate
the complexity of the fast and slow solar wind origin.

A signiﬁcant feature for the CH wind speeds are their two peak distributions for all three solar activity phases. We
suggest that the fast and slow distribution peaks come from the CH center and the boundary regions that include
both CH open and QS/AR close magnetic ﬁelds, respectively. For instance, as shown in the wind-source identiﬁcation
example in Figure 1, the solar wind streams coming from CH core regions are faster, while the CH boundary streams
are slower. Similar results are shown by Neugebauer et al. (2002, see Figure 11 in their paper) and Ko et al. (2014,
Figure 1 in their paper). Several studies have suggested that structures like coronal bright points and plumes which
are located in CH boundary regions may also be sources of the SSW (e.g., Madjarska et al. 2004; Subramanian et al.
2010; Madjarska et al. 2012; Fu et al. 2014; Karpen et al. 2016). This can be interpreted by both the WTD and RLO
models. In the WTD models, it means that the super radial expansion and curvature degree of the open magnetic-ﬁeld
lines are smaller and lower at the center of CHs compared to CH boundary regions. RLO models suggest that loops
that reconnect with open magnetic-ﬁeld lines have lower temperature at CH central regions than loops located in
the boundary regions. The two peak distribution of solar wind speeds may, therefore, reﬂect either the super radial
expansion and the curvature degree of the open magnetic-ﬁeld lines, or loop temperature.

As shown in Figure 2, (b1) the CH solar-wind speed distribution has a stronger peak at ∼400 km s−1, and a second
weaker peak at ∼600 km s−1 during the solar maximum. During the decline and minimum phases, the second peak
at ∼600 km s−1 is stronger than the peak at lower speeds. The two-peak distribution variation of the CH wind
may be related to the diﬀerent average areas and physical properties (such as magnetic ﬁeld strength) of CHs during
diﬀerent solar activity phases (Wang 2009). Another possible explanation is the diﬀerence of the heliospheric structure
during the diﬀerent solar cycle phases. During solar maximum, ACE may encounter a longer period of neutral line or
heliospheric current sheet which usually corresponds to the SSW, thus the slow wind peak is higher. The faster peak
at ∼600 km s−1 is stronger because there are more equatorial CHs during the decline phase (Wang 2009).

As it can be seen from the middle and bottom rows in Figure 2, in all three phases of the solar cycle discussed
here the average values of O7+/O6+ and NF e/NO are the highest for the AR wind, the lowest for the CH wind with
the QS wind in between. Consistent with Kilpua et al. (2016), our study demonstrates that the distributions of the
speed, O7+/O6+, and NF e/NO ratios for the diﬀerent types of solar wind have a large overlap, and therefore, it is
hard to distinguish the source regions only by those wind parameters. The other characteristics for the parameters of
O7+/O6+ and NF e/NO ratio will be discussed in Section 3.2 and 3.3

3.2. Distributions in the space of speed vs O7+/O6+
Figure 3 shows the scatter plot of O7+/O6+ versus the solar wind speed for the diﬀerent source regions, i.e. CH, AR,
and QS. For the purpose of being comparable to previous studies, we show in column 1 of Figure 3 the relation between
O7+/O6+ and the solar wind speeds for all three regions summed together. The distributions for each individual source
regions are shown in column 2, 3 and 4 of Figure 3. The anti-correlation of the solar wind speed and O7+/O6+ remains

Although there are some diﬀerences in parameter distributions for diﬀerent types of solar wind, it has a big over-lap. The
signiﬁcant characteristic is a bimodal speed distribution for CH wind in all three solar phases.

valid for all three types of solar wind. In the left column of Figure 3, the linear ﬁt of the distributions for the diﬀerent
source regions of solar wind are overplotted, showing that slopes and intercepts are the same for the diﬀerent solar-wind
source regions. Quantitatively, the slops are −0.0027, −0.0028 and −0.0028 for CH, AR and QS wind, respectively,
during solar maximum, and −0.0026, −0.0025, −0.0030 at the decline phase, and −0.0038, −0.0035, −0.0034 during
the solar minimum. The absolute values of the slops for a certain type of solar wind are almost constant during the
solar maximum and decline phases and larger during the solar minimum.

The anti-correlation between solar wind speed and O7+/O6+ was ﬁrst reported by observations from the International
Sun-Earth Explorer 3 (ISEE 3) and Ulysses (Ogilvie et al. 1989; Geiss et al. 1995). Gloeckler et al. (2003) suggested
that this observational fact supports the notion that the mechanism suggested by the RLO models is the main physical
process for heating and acceleration of the nascent solar wind. Our statistical study shows that the anti-correlation
between solar wind speeds and O7+/O6+ is not only present for the CH wind (Ko et al. 2014) but is also valid for
the AR and QS wind. This suggests that the mechanisms which account for the anti-correlation between the solar
wind speeds and O7+/O6+ ratio are the same in CH, QS, and AR wind. Relating to the RLO models, this means
that the correlation between loop size and loop temperature is similar in all three types of regions. With regard to
the WTD models, this suggests that the super radial expansion and curvature degree of the open magnetic ﬁled lines
is proportional to the source region temperature. The anti-correlation between the solar wind speed and O7+/O6+
can also be explained by a scaling law, in which a higher coronal electron temperature leads to more energy lost
from radiation for SSW, and vice versa as suggested by Schwadron & McComas (2003), Schwadron et al. (2014), and
Schwadron et al. (2011). This scaling law is required for all magnetically driven solar wind models. Considering
that the physical parameters and magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations for a certain type of region (CH, AR and QS) have a
large range, our statistical results for the diﬀerent types of solar wind provide a test for this scaling law. Our results
demonstrate that the relationship for solar wind speed and O7+/O6+ is valid and is almost the same for diﬀerent types

of solar wind, which means the scaling law is valid in all three types of solar wind.

3.3. Distributions in the space of speed vs NF e/NO

Figure 4 presents the scatter plot of the solar wind speed versus NF e/NO again for all three regions together in
column 1, and for the individual source regions in columns 2, 3, and 4. The distribution for all three regions together
is similar to earlier studies (e.g. Abbo et al. 2016, and the references therein). There are four important features
concerning the relation between NF e/NO and the solar wind speeds. First, the average value of NF e/NO is the highest
in the AR wind, and the lowest for the CH wind. Second, the NF e/NO range (0.06–0.40, FIP bias range 1–7) for the
AR wind is wider than for the CH wind (0.06–0.20, FIP bias range 1–3). Third, similar to the wind as a whole, the
NF e/NO ranges and their average values all decrease with the increasing solar wind speed in the diﬀerent types of
solar wind. Fourth, the minimum value of NF e/NO is similar (∼0.06, FIP bias ∼1) for all source regions and it does
not change with the speed of the solar wind.

The remote measurements in the solar corona given by Widing & Feldman (2001), Brooks & Warren (2011), and
Baker et al. (2013) show that the FIP bias is higher in AR regions (dominated by loops) than in CHs. The FIP bias in
CHs is between 1 and 1.5 (Feldman et al. 2005), while in ARs it can reach values larger than 4 in the case of older ARs
(Widing & Feldman 2001). The remote measurements of the solar corona also show that the variation of FIP bias in
ARs is larger than in CHs (McKenzie & Feldman 1992; Widing & Feldman 2001). Our results demonstrate that the
NF e/NO ranges and their average value are higher in the AR wind. This means that the plasma stored in closed loops
can escape into interplanetary space, and that this mass supply scenario is consistent with the RLO models.

The diﬀerences in NF e/NO ranges and their average values between diﬀerent source regions of solar wind can also be
explained qualitatively by the RLO models. Feldman et al. (2005) reviewed the morphological features in the upper
atmosphere. They showed that the small loops (10–20 arcsecs) are cooler (30 000 K to 0.7 MK) and have shorter

9

lifetime (100 to 500 s) in QS and CH regions. There are also larger loops (tens to hundreds of arcsecs) which have
higher temperature (1.2–1.6 MK) and longer lifetime (1–2 days) in QS regions. By reconstructing the magnetic ﬁeld
with the help of a potential magnetic ﬁeld model, Wiegelmann & Solanki (2004) suggest that the loops in CHs are on
average ﬂatter and shorter than in the QS. The range of loop sizes and temperatures are wider in AR regions including
small (10–20 arcsecs) cool (<0.1 MK) loops (Huang et al. 2015), as well cool (0.1 MK – 1 MK), warm (1–2M K) and
hot hot (> 2 MK) loops with lengths ranging from a few tens to a few hundreds of arcsecs (e.g. Landi & Landini 2004;
Aschwanden et al. 2008, Xie et al. ApJ (submitted)).
The above results mean that the ranges of temperatures
and loop sizes are wider in AR regions than in CHs. Although this relation is not strictly proportional, the lifetime
of loops is connected to these parameters. Widing & Feldman (2001) studied the FIP bias of four emerging active
regions and found that the FIP bias increases progressively after the emergence. They concluded that the low FIP
elements enrichment relates to the age of coronal loops. The AR wind may both come from new loops (with low FIP
bias) and old loops (with higher FIP bias). Therefore, the NF e/NO range and its average value in the AR wind is
wider (higher) than in the CH wind.

The fact that NF e/NO range and average value decrease with the increasing solar wind speed in all three types of
solar wind (see Figure 4) can also be explained qualitatively by the RLO models. Fisk (2003) showed that the speed
of the solar wind is inverse to the loop temperatures. For the fast wind, the loops in the source regions are cooler
and their life time is shorter. Thus, their FIP bias is lower and its distribution range is narrower. In contrast, the slow
wind is at the other extreme. There are two possible interpretations for the fact that the minimum value of NF e/NO
is similar (∼0.06, FIP bias ∼1) for all source regions and it does not change with speed of the solar wind. First, in the
RLO models, some of the new born loops (size may be large or small) reconnect with the open ﬁeld lines producing
solar wind with lower NF e/NO (wind speed is slow or fast). Second, based on the WTD models the solar wind escapes
directly along the open magnetic ﬁeld lines and the FIP fractionation is restricted to the top of the chromosphere
based on a model in which the FIP fractionation is caused by ponderomotive force (Laming 2004, 2012). Thus, the
FIP bias is lower (∼1–2) in open ﬁled lines compared with that in the closed loops (∼2–7, please see Table 3 and 4
in Laming (2015)). In all three types of regions, the solar wind which escapes from open magnetic ﬁled lines directly
has lower FIP bias, regardless of whether the speed is slow or fast.

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

The main purpose of this work was to examine the statistical properties of the solar wind originating from diﬀerent
solar regions, i.e. CHs, ARs, and QS. The solar wind speeds, O7+/O6+, and NF e/NO were analyzed for diﬀerent solar
cycle phases (maximum, decline, and minimum). Our main results can be summarized as follows:

1. We found in the present study that the proportions of FSW and SSW are 59.3% and 40.7% for CH regions.
Fast solar wind is also found to emanate from AR and the QS, and the proportion of the FSW from AR and QS
with respect to their total solar wind input are 13.7% and 17.0%, 25.8% and 28.4%, 34.0% and 36.8%, during the
solar maximum, decline, and minimum phases, respectively. The distributions of speed, O7+/O6+, and NF e/NO
ratio for the diﬀerent source regions of solar wind have large overlaps indicating that it is hard to distinguish the
source regions only by those wind parameters.

2. We found that the speed distribution of the CH wind is bimodal in all three solar activity phases. The peak of
the fast wind from CHs for the period of time studied here is found to be at ∼ 600 km s−1 and the slow wind
peak is at ∼ 400 km s−1. The fast and slow wind components possibly come from the center and boundary
regions of CHs, respectively.

3. This study demonstrates that the anti-correlation between the speed and O7+/O6+ ratio remains valid in all

three types of solar wind and during the three studied solar cycle activity phases.

4. We identify four features of the distribution of NF e/NO in the diﬀerent solar wind types. The average value of
NF e/NO is highest in the AR wind, and lowest for the CH wind. The average values and ranges of NF e/NO all
decrease with the solar wind speed. The NF e/NO range in the AR wind is larger (0.06–0.40) than in CH wind
(0.06–0.20). The minimum value of NF e/NO (∼ 0.06) does not change with the variation of speed, and it is
similar for all source regions.

The statistical results indicate that the solar wind streams that come from diﬀerent source regions are subject to
similar constraints. This suggests that the heating and acceleration mechanisms of the nascent solar wind in coronal

holes, active regions, and quiet Sun have great similarities. The two-peak distribution of the CH wind and the anti-
correlation between the speed and O7+/O6+ in all three types of solar wind can be explained qualitatively by both
the WTD and RLO models, whereas the distribution features of NF e/NO in diﬀerent source regions of solar wind can
be explained more reasonably by the RLO models.
