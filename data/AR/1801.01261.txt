Abstract The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) CubeSat is the
ﬁrst solar science oriented CubeSat mission ﬂown for the NASA Science Mission
Directorate, with the main objective of measuring the solar soft X-ray (SXR)
ﬂux and a science goal of determining its inﬂuence on Earth’s ionosphere and
thermosphere. These observations can also be used to investigate solar quiescent,
active region, and ﬂare properties. The MinXSS X-ray instruments consist of a
spectrometer, called X123, with a nominal 0.15 keV full-width-half-maximum
(FWHM) resolution at 5.9 keV and a broadband X-ray photometer, called XP.
Both instruments are designed to obtain measurements from 0.5 – 30 keV at
a nominal time cadence of 10 seconds. A description of the MinXSS instru-
ments, performance capabilities, and relation to the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) 0.1 – 0.8 nm ﬂux are discussed in this article.
Early MinXSS results demonstrate the capability to measure variations of the
solar spectral SXR ﬂux between 0.8 – 12 keV from at least GOES A5–M5 (5 ×
10−8 – 5 × 10−5 W m−2) levels and infer physical properties (temperature and
emission measure) from the MinXSS data alone. Moreover, coronal elemental
abundances can be inferred, speciﬁcally Fe, Ca, Si, Mg, S, Ar, and Ni, when there
is suﬃciently high count rate at each elemental spectral feature. Additionally,
temperature response curves and emission measure loci demonstrate the MinXSS
sensitivity to plasma emission at diﬀerent temperatures. MinXSS observations
coupled with those from other solar observatories can help address some of
the most compelling questions in solar coronal physics. Finally, simultaneous
observations by MinXSS and Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (RHESSI) can provide the most spectrally complete soft X-ray solar ﬂare
photon ﬂux measurements to date.

1. Introduction

The objective of the Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) CubeSats
is to explore the highly variable solar soft X-ray (SXR) spectral distribution
and reveal its impact on Earth’s ionosphere and thermosphere. The MinXSS X-
ray instruments consist of a spectrometer, called X123, with a nominal 0.15 keV
full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) resolution at 5.9 keV and a broadband X-ray
photometer, called XP. Both instruments are designed to obtain measurements
from 0.5 - 30 keV at a nominal time cadence of 10 seconds. Solar soft X-rays are
strongly absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere in the E-region at an altitude of about
∼80 - 150 km. This energy input can strongly aﬀect the energetics and dynamics
of the ionosphere and thermosphere. These solar measurements can also be used
to directly investigate the properties of the solar corona, which is dominated by
magnetic ﬁeld dynamics, resulting in tenuous, high temperature plasma of over
1 MK. The primary heating source or the relative contributions of the many
components to coronal heating are still in question. While MinXSS data alone

MinXSS Instruments

cannot address the root of this question, the spectrally resolved measurements
from MinXSS combined with other solar observations can yield critical informa-
tion on this and other compelling questions in solar physics. MinXSS is not the
ﬁrst spectrometer to conduct these type of measurements, but it has unique new
capabilities that can be advantageous over previous full Sun ﬂux (irradiance)
measurements from spatially integrating spectrometers.

Currently, there are no solar instruments continuously conducting spectrally
resolved soft X-ray measurements over a relatively large energy range. Fairly
recent spectrally resolved, spatially integrated measurements have been con-
ducted by CORONAS-PHOTON Solar Photometer in X-rays (SphinX) (Gburek
et al., 2013) and MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and
Ranging (MESSENGER) Solar Assembly for X-rays (SAX) (Schlemm et al.,
2007). SphinX conducted solar measurements over a time-frame of roughly 9
months in 2009 during a time of very low solar X-ray ﬂux levels, including the
lowest solar X-ray levels ever recorded. The SphinX designed spectral coverage
was ∼1 - 15 keV at a nominal 0.4 keV spectral resolution. MESSENGER SAX
performed solar measurements primarily at an orbit around Mercury from 1 - 10
keV at a nominal spectral resolution of 0.6 keV and has measured numerous solar
ﬂares (Dennis et al., 2015) from 2011 March to 2015 April. Like the MinXSS solar
X-ray measurements, both of these spectrometers generated spatially integrated
spectra over the instruments’ ﬁeld of view (FOV). MinXSS is designed to greatly
improve upon these measurements and enhance the ability to determine emission
line features with an improved spectral resolution (nominally ∼0.15 keV at 5.9
keV, due to detector architecture and electronics), a lower energy threshold
(Eph (cid:38) 0.8 keV, due to a slightly thinner Be window for MinXSS-2), and by
providing near-continuous dedicated solar measurements over a ∼6 year period
(MinXSS-1 1 year mission + MinXSS-2 5 year mission) during the declining
phase of Solar Cycle 24, throughout solar minimum, and into the rising phase
of Solar Cycle 25. MinXSS-1 was deployed from the International Space Station
on 2016 May 16 and performed solar measurements until re-entry into Earth’s
atmosphere on 2017 May 6. MinXSS-2 is scheduled to launch no-earlier-than
(NET) 2018 February.

1.1. Current Solar Soft X-ray Measurements

The aforementioned solar soft X-ray measurements lack direct spatial infor-
mation. Combining spatially integrated, spectrally resolved measurements of
MinXSS with data from other solar X-ray observatories can provide information
on solar conditions. The Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT) (Kosugi et al., 2007;
Golub et al., 2007) uses ﬁlters to create spectrally separated images of the soft X-
ray intensity, but lacks ﬁne spectral knowledge. The Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) Soft X-ray Imager (SXI) (Hill et al., 2005),
exhibits similar qualitative spectral capabilities as XRT, but also suﬀers from
the same issue of spectrally convolved images. The GOES X-ray Sensor (XRS)
conducts spectrally (Garcia, 1994) and spatially integrated measurements in two
bands (0.1 - 0.8 nm and 0.05 - 0.4 nm). A ratio of these two bands can yield
an isothermal approximation to the coronal plasma temperature at the time of

SOLA: minxss_instrument_paper_final_resubmit2.tex; 8 January 2018; 1:37; p. 3

C. S. Moore et al.

measurement (White, Thomas, and Schwartz, 2005). The Reuven Ramaty High
Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) (Lin et al., 2002) has provided
spectral and spatial information using a Fourier imaging technique. RHESSI’s
primary spectral coverage extends from 6 keV - 17 MeV, with systematics-
limited sensitivity below 6 keV. RHESSI’s best spectral resolution in the 3 - 100
keV bandpass is ∼1 keV FWHM coupled with a 2.3 arcsecond FWHM spatial
resolution. Additionally, the astronomy based Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope
ARray (NuSTAR) (Harrison et al., 2013) satellite has performed a series of solar
measurements which have been summarized in Grefenstette et al. (2016) and
Hannah et al. (2016). The NuSTAR nominal 0.4 keV FWHM spectral resolution
can produce spectral images with ∼18 arcsecond spatial resolution over its ∼11
arcminute ﬁeld of view.

1.2. MinXSS Science Goals

MinXSS data combined with the soft X-ray instrument data mentioned earlier,
can be used in conjunction with other UV-Visible space observatories such as
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin,
2012), the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrograph (EIS) (Culhane et al., 2007) and
the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) (Tsuneta et al., 2008), the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS) (De Pontieu et al., 2014), to mention a few, to
address pertinent science questions about the solar atmosphere. Speciﬁcally, the
corona’s high temperature, low density, and magnetic conditions have been of
keen interest for decades since the observations of ‘coronium’ lines in the solar
spectrum (Rayet, 1868; Seechi, 1875; Golub and Pasachoﬀ, 2010). Better under-
standing the solar soft X-ray energy distribution allow for improved inferences
of plasma conditions present during various stages of the solar cycle and during
solar ﬂares. In addition understanding the solar soft X-ray inﬂuence on Earth’s
ionosphere and thermosphere, a few main solar science questions and tasks that
MinXSS data will help address are:

• What is the solar soft X-ray energy distribution as a function of solar
cycle phase (at least the falling and rising phases) for the following
components?

-
-
-

ﬂares
active regions (AR)
the quiescent Sun (QS)

• What is the AR variation in temperature, density, emission measure,
chemical composition and magnetic complexity as a function of AR age
and solar cycle phases?

• How are processes diﬀerent between eruptive and non-eruptive compact
ﬂares?

• What is the soft X-ray spectral connection to magnetic complexity in the
solar atmosphere?

MinXSS Instruments

In order to eﬀectively include MinXSS data in any solar analysis, it is necessary
to understand the performance capabilities of the MinXSS X-ray instruments.
This paper describes the basic instrument characteristics and will be a
reference for scientists interested in utilizing MinXSS. The remainder of this
paper includes basic descriptions of the MinXSS CubeSat mission in Section 2,
an overview of the instruments in Section 3, capabilities of these instruments in
Section 4, followed by examples of MinXSS-1 measurements from low solar
levels (GOES A5) to an M5 ﬂare and plasma inferences in Section 5.
Additional references for MinXSS include an overview of the MinXSS CubeSat
and its subsystems by Mason et al. (2016), pre-ﬂight calibration results by
Moore et al. (2016), and early mission results by Woods et al. (2017).

2. The MinXSS CubeSats Mission

The MinXSS CubeSats development and testing involved extensive graduate
student involvement in collaboration with the University of Colorado-Boulder’s
Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP), and the Aerospace
Engineering Sciences Department, with assistance from professors and
professionals. The ﬁrst of the twin satellites, MinXSS-1 was ferried to the
International Space Station (ISS) from the Kennedy Space Center on 2015
December 6. MinXSS-1 was deployed from the ISS on 2016 May 16 to a Low
Earth Orbit (LEO) with an initial altitude of ∼402 km. MinXSS-1 commenced
science operations on 2016 June 9. The second CubeSat, MinXSS-2, is
scheduled to launch to a Sun-synchronous orbit NET February of 2018.
Figure 1 is a picture of the MinXSS-1 3U CubeSat, noting that 1 Unit (1U) is
10 cm × 10 cm × 11.35 cm in size. Even though they are small relative to
traditional solar observing satellites, the MinXSS CubeSats are fully
functioning satellites. They include triple junction GaAs solar cells from
AzurSpace, Li-polymer batteries, Electrical Power System (EPS), an Attitude
and Determination Control System (ADCS) supplied by Blue Canyon
Technologies, a tape measure for a radio antenna, a Li-1 radio for
communication, Command and Data Handling (CDH) microcontroller, and
science instruments. The positions of these subsystems in the MinXSS
spacecraft are in Figure 2. An overview of these subsystems is described in
Mason et al. (2016). MinXSS-2 is an augmented version of MinXSS-1 with
planned improvements in hardware, software and the implementations of
lessons learned from the MinXSS-1 mission. Scientiﬁcally, one of the most
important upgrades of MinXSS-2 is a newer version of the X-ray spectrometer.
The MinXSS-1 instruments are listed in Table 1 and consist of a visible-light
Sun Position Sensor (SPS), an X-ray photometer (XP), and an X-ray
spectrometer called X123. Nominally the MinXSS science data are composed of
10 second integrations, that can be decreased to 3 seconds or increased to 1
minute depending on the scientiﬁc objectives. The next section describes the
full set of MinXSS instruments and their capabilities.

Sats. The CubeSat is oriented so that the solar panels and instrument apertures are facing the
viewer (desired Sun facing side on-orbit). The MinXSS CubeSats are designed to measure the
solar X-ray ﬂux from 0.5 - 30 keV using the X-ray Photometer (XP) for spectrally integrated
measurements across the entire energy band and the X123 spectrometer for energy resolved
photon-counting measurements. The X123 spectrometer has a nominal spectral resolution of
0.15 keV full-width-half-maximum (FWHM). MinXSS-1 was deployed from the International
Space Station on 2016 May 16 with an initial LEO altitude of ∼402 km for an anticipated
mission lifetime of ∼12 months, depending on solar activity. MinXSS-2 is to be launched to a
Sun-synchronous orbit of ∼500 km NET February of 2018 for an anticipated 5 year mission.

3. MinXSS Instrument Description

3.1. Sun Position Sensor (SPS)

SPS is a visible-light sensitive quad silicon-photodiode (Si-photodiode)
arrangement behind an ND7 (neutral density ﬁlter with an attenuation factor
of 107). The Si-photodiodes have a 55 µm thick depletion depth. The SPS
square aperture is 2 × 2 mm and the layout is discussed in the Appendix in
Section A and in Figure 16. The relative solar illumination on each of the four
diodes is used to calculate the solar position within the MinXSS X-ray
instruments’ ﬁeld of view (FOV). The absolute position knowledge is accurate
to within 10 arcseconds and the pointing is controlled to a precision of 10
arcseconds, limited by the capabilities of the Blue Canyon XACT ADCS
system.

3.2. X-ray Photometer (XP)

The LASP designed XP unit consists of a Si-photodiode (55 µm thick
depletion depth) with a beryllium (Be) window 19.0 µm thick for MinXSS-1
and 18.0 µm thick for MinXSS-2 to attenuate visible-light contamination. The
XP aperture is 5 mm in diameter. The main purpose of XP is to serve as a
consistency check to the detected photon ﬂux and linearity of the X-ray
spectrometer X123, assessing long term degradation trends, and comparison to
the GOES XRS photometers. The Si-photodiodes in XP and SPS have been
ﬂown numerous times, such as on SDO (Woods et al., 2012), are known to be
stable in space, and have linear response over the full range of solar ﬂux levels
after corrections to various inﬂuences. The XP photodiode response can have
gain and dark current variations due to thermal ﬂuctuations, and can possibly
suﬀer noise from sources internal to the MinXSS spacecraft (e.g. emf, radio
transmission, microphonics, etc.), which must be corrected for. After gain and
dark current corrections, the XP product returns one spectrally integrated
value for the solar X-ray contribution over its expected spectral response from
∼0.5 - 30 keV. This type of information is valuable, but of similar class to the
GOES XRS. The spectral information provided by the X-ray spectrometer,
X123, can greatly enhance the interpretation of the XP data.

3.3. X-ray Spectrometer (X123)

The MinXSS main scientiﬁc instrument, X123, is an X-ray spectrometer
purchased from Amptek (Amptek website: http://amptek.com/). The data
returned from X123 will be the most important data product that MinXSS will
provide to the scientiﬁc community. X123 is composed of a Silicon Drift
Detector (SDD) with a 500 µm thick Si depletion depth behind a Be window
24.5 µm thick for MinXSS-1 and 11.2 µm thick for MinXSS-2. From pre-ﬂight
calibrations, there appears to be Zn contaminant in the MinXSS-2 Be ﬁlter
with an approximate thickness of 0.1 µm for MinXSS-2. The X123 dead-layer
is comprised mostly of SiO and has a nominal thickness around 0.15 µm. We

SOLA: minxss_instrument_paper_final_resubmit2.tex; 8 January 2018; 1:37; p. 8

MinXSS Instruments

did not measure the deadlayer thickness ourselves but include the nominal
value into our detector modeling. This thickness of SiO does not strongly
impact the detector high energy eﬃciency, but could contribute to the low
energy (< 1 keV) eﬃciency. This folds into our low energy eﬃciency.
Amptek provides the X123 electronics for power regulation and X-ray photon
energy detection and embedded software for reading the spectrometer output.
Thus, in addition to X-ray characterization, the main task remaining is to
integrate the X123 output to the MinXSS CDH processor that compresses the
data and formats it into data packets. The power draw from X123 is nominally
∼2.8 W during normal operations and at max ∼5.0 W (normally at turn on).
The X123 spectrometer is actively cooled with a thermoelectric cooler (also
provided by Amptek) to ∼224 K. The cooling is necessary to minimize thermal
noise which will contribute to the lower energy bins (Ebin ≤ 1.0 keV). The
X123 sensor resides inside a stainless steel housing behind a tungsten
FOV-limiting pinhole aperture with a ∼0.18 mm diameter to protect from
energetic particles and hard X-rays.

3.4. Detector Operation

The X123 SDD, XP and SPS operation relies, in principle, on electron-hole
pair generation in the Si lattice by the incident photon ﬂux. Photons and any
other energy sources (these contribute to the noise) that have more than the Si
electron-hole pair generation energy (Ee−h (cid:39) 3.65 eV) can create a number of
electron-hole pairs proportional to the energy of the incident photon. For the
SPS and XP detectors, the liberated charges contribute to a current which is
measured, ampliﬁed and converted to a digital unit. The diﬀerence for the X123
spectrometer is that the electrons generated by this energy deposition process
drift toward the readout anode and the resulting charge is integrated on a
capacitor within the detector rise time (peaking time). These energy ‘impulses’
are deemed events. The preampliﬁer, which consists of a Field Eﬀect Transistor
(JFET for MinXSS-1 and MOSFET for MinXSS-2), that ampliﬁes the signal,
converts it to a voltage, and this voltage ramp is shaped to a trapezoid. Each
of these shaped signals are used to discern the energy deposited in the active
detector volume by the incident photon ‘event’. The performance capabilities
of the X-ray instruments are discussed in the next Section.

4. MinXSS X-ray Instrument Capabilities

The instruments were characterized using radioactive lab sources for spectral
resolution, optimization of electronic settings, determining the gain and energy
oﬀset of the X123 spectrometer. SPS, XP and X123 FOV, XP and X123
window thicknesses, spectral eﬃciency, and linearity were determined from the
National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Synchrotron
Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF) measurements. MinXSS X123
spectrometer basic performance properties and characterization methodology
are described in Moore et al. (2016). Accurate knowledge of the electron beam

current, electron beam energy, magnetic ﬁeld strength, and source distance
allows for the precise calculation of the synchrotron light spectral intensity to
enable calibration of the X123 and XP responsivities with about 10% accuracy
(Moore et al., 2016).

4.1. Field of View Sensitivity

The MinXSS X-ray instruments integrate the incident radiation across their
FOVs to create their respective signals. While XP and X123 do not have spatial
resolution per se, they do possess a sensitivity to light intensity across their
respective FOVs. XP nominally has an angular response across an 8◦ FOV and
X123 has a FOV of 4◦. An example of the alpha-beta (α-β) coordinate system
used for the SURF calibrations is given in the SPS image in Figure 16. An
extended source such as the Sun viewed from Earth will have an angular size of

roughly 0.5◦, but the response can vary strongly depending on the actual X-ray
coronal structure during observations. This is well within the FOV of XP and
X123. For the most accurate photometric measurements from MinXSS, it is
important to correct for the solar disc position within the MinXSS FOV.
Figure 3 shows FOV sensitivity maps of MinXSS-1 and MinXSS-2 X123. The
maps are a 1.4◦ × 1.4◦ subset, centered on the FOV of X123. The XP map
yields similar FOV sensitivities. The values are the raw NIST SURF
determined MinXSS response maps, convolved with the visible-light solar disc,
and expressed as a percent diﬀerence in the total signal summed over all
energies at that position with respect to the center, to estimate the X-ray
detection variation across the FOV. This pre-ﬂight map serves as our baseline
until on-orbit maps are created for comparison. The absolute variation across
the centered 1.4◦ × 1.4◦ FOV is around 8%. The MinXSS ADCS unit (XACT
from Blue Canyon Technologies) has proven to keep the Sun within 0.3◦ of the
center of the MinXSS FOV with a precision of 10 arcseconds (∼0.028◦). Thus,
the inner 1◦ diameter annular region is the most important for MinXSS
on-orbit performance and the absolute variation within this region is no larger
than about 5%. We note that only mechanical alignment was implemented
between the XACT ADCS unit and the instruments.

4.2. Spectral Resolution

The X123 spectral resolution, energy bin gain and oﬀset have been estimated
using radioactive line sources of 55Fe for the ∼5.90 and ∼6.49 keV line

complexes, and 241Am for the ∼11.87, ∼13.95, and ∼17.75 keV lines. The ﬁt
values for the both the MinXSS-1 X123 gain and MinXSS-2 X123 gain are
0.0297 keV/bin and are consistent with the nominal bin width (0.03 keV). The
oﬀset is dependent on the electrical grounding conditions at the time of
operation, due to the fact that the pulse height analysis is computed on top of
a baseline voltage, which can drift. Thus, the X123 energy oﬀset in the lab at
LASP for radioactive source measurements, at NIST SURF and on-orbit may
not be exactly the same. Nominally, the value for MinXSS-1 energy bin oﬀset
is around -0.076 keV and the MinXSS-2 energy bin oﬀset is close to -0.265 keV.
The X123 has a customizable peaking time, which dictates how long the
photon liberated electron charge cloud is integrated on the readout capacitor.
The longer the peaking time, the better the spectral resolution. MinXSS-1 has
a ﬁxed peaking time of 4.8 µs but we have tested the MinXSS-2 X123 detector
for various peaking times between 0.6 - 9.6 µs. We will operate the MinXSS-2
X123 for peaking times between 1.2 - 4.8 µs due to the tradeoﬀ between
spectral resolution and eﬀective maximum count rate that can be recorded
before photon pile-up begins to occur. We only show data for these 1.2 - 4.8 µs
peaking times in this paper. The longer the peaking time, the lower the
maximum count rate that can be accurately measured. Details on the
maximum count rate are discussed in Section 4.6.
Figure 4 shows example MinXSS-2 X123 55Fe measurements from 1 - 10 keV
and 241Am measurements from 10 - 30 keV. The subset of lines used to assess
the spectral resolution at speciﬁc energies are signiﬁed by the vertical dotted
lines. An expanded in plot of the 55Fe for the ∼5.90 and ∼6.49 keV line
complexes are in Moore et al. (2016). The nominal spectral resolution near 5.9
keV was conﬁrmed for the respective peaking times. MinXSS-1 X123 detector
resolution measurements were not performed like the MinXSS-2 detector.
Thus, we asses the on-orbit resolution which currently estimated to be ∼0.24
keV, which is much broader than the nominal 0.15 keV spectral resolution at
5.9 keV for a 4.8 µs peaking time. We are currently assessing the reasons for a
degraded on-orbit resolution. MinXSS-2 has an improved version of the X123
spectrometer, the X123 Fast SDD. The X123 Fast SDD has an improved
preampliﬁer, a MOSFET transistor instead of a JFET for the MinXSS-1
version. This has a lower eﬀective capacitance, lower noise and results in
improved spectral resolution for the same peaking times as the older version.
An advantage is increased maximum count rate, which will be discussed in
Section 4.6. The spectral resolution for MinXSS-2 at 5.9 keV is 0.137 keV for
4.8 µs, 0.162 keV for 2.4 µs, and 0.168 keV for 1.2 µs.
The resolving power at X-ray energies for Si based detectors is limited by Fano
Noise (Knoll, 2010). Fano Noise is the intrinsic statistical variation in the
electron-hole pair generation rate per event and is represented by the solid
black line in Figure 4. The Fano Factor (F) is essentially the ratio between the
observed variance to the expected Poisson variance and for silicon is around
0.1. The Fano Noise in FWHM units is σF ano = 2.35 ∗
the photon energy and Ee−h is the electron-hole pair generation. The
electronic noise contribution was estimated from the 55Fe for the ∼5.90 and
∼6.49 keV data and used to scale up the Fano Noise to provide an estimate of

Figure 4. Example plot of MinXSS-2 X123 spectral resolution estimates vs. photon energy
using radioactive X-ray sources. The top split-plot shows the normalized counts from the 55Fe
source from 1 - 10 keV and the 241Am source from 10 - 30 keV. The 55Fe ∼5.90 and ∼6.49 keV
line complexes are easily detected. The 241Am ∼11.87, ∼13.95, and ∼17.75 keV lines are used
for spectral resolution estimates. The vertical dotted line emphasizes which spectral lines were
used for FWHM resolution estimates for three diﬀerent spectrometer peaking times. Longer
peaking times yield better photon energy resolving power up to the combined electronic and
Fano Limit. The Fano Limit is the intrinsic statistical limit of bulk Si semiconductor material
to resolve energy diﬀerences, and is over-plotted with the black solid line. The colored lines
are the Fano Limit (from Fano Noise) with an estimated electronic noise contribution from
the 55Fe measurements. These estimates depicted by the color lines are used to extrapolate
the spectral resolution to higher photon energies. The extrapolation to lower energies is not
expected to adhere to these lines due to other noise sources (microphonics, thermal noise, and
other uncharacterized sources).

the spectral resolution at the higher energies. The extrapolation to lower
energies is not expected to adhere to these lines due to other noise sources
(microphonics, thermal noise, and other uncharacterized sources).

4.3. Spectral Eﬃciency and Eﬀective Area

The XP 55 µm and X123 SDD 500 µm thick depletion depths for Si based
X-ray detectors dictate the high energy cut-oﬀ eﬃciency. The window material
and composition aﬀect the high and low energy eﬃciency. For Be based
windows only the lower energy photons are attenuated and thus the Be window
thickness dictates the low energy photon response. Noise contributions,
primarily electronic noise, limit the XP signal ﬁdelity and the X123 lower
energy contribution. The MinXSS instrument spectral eﬃciency was
determined through a series of measurements conducted at NIST SURF and
the details are listed in Moore et al. (2016). The SURF photon spectrum is
known to within 10% near 1 keV and produces statistically signiﬁcant counts
up to about 3 keV. Model uncertainties in the ﬁtted detector window
thicknesses, depletion depth thicknesses and atomic coeﬃcients yield
uncertainties near 20% for the higher energies. Since the SURF spectrum is a
continuum, it is not very useful for the spectral resolution estimates, such as
those discussed in Section 4.2, but the absolute synchrotron photon spectral
distribution can be used to determine the detection eﬃciency of the MinXSS
X-ray instruments.
The MinXSS XP signal can be calculated from the following expression in
Equation 1, where CXP is the XP count rate with units of DN
DN is the Data Number, which is converted from the femtoCoulomb (fC)
signal by the XP gain, GXP . The bracketed term is the femtoamps (fA)

In the case of the Sun, there is a distribution of photons as a function of X-ray
energy, and a function of position in the extended corona. The Sun appears as
an extended object and its position can vary within the MinXSS FOV. The
physical extent of the X-ray emission from the Sun is encompassed in the solid
angle, Ω, which is not necessarily the simple conversion of
πsin2(θ(cid:12)) ≈ π(cid:0) R(cid:12)
not conﬁned to the visible-light solar disk. An example of the distribution of
X-ray emission that MinXSS can detect is illustrated in the Hinode XRT
images in Figure 11. Thus, S(Eph, Ω) is an intensity or radiance, in units of
photons s−1 keV−1 cm−2 ster−1 in this formulation. AXP is the XP aperture
geometric area, in units of cm2. The XP detector response RXP (Eph, Ω)
includes the XP detector eﬃciency, the conversion from photon energy to fC,
(cid:15)ph, and the FOV sensitivity which is encompassed in the Ω dependence. In
theory, the integral of the bracketed term can include all photon energies from

MinXSS Instruments

0 to ∞ incident on the XP area, but the actual high and low energy limits are
set by the XP detector response.
The combination of the XP detector response and geometric area constitutes
an ‘eﬀective area’. The XP MinXSS-1 and MinXSS-2 eﬀective area curves are
displayed in Figure 5. The main XP photon response lies between 0.5 - 30 keV,
with the actual count contribution depending on the solar X-ray spectrum,
S(Eph, Ω), during observations. Both MinXSS-1 and MinXSS-2 XP devices
have similar responses as their Be windows are of similar thickness (19.0 µm
for MinXSS-1 and 18.0 µm for MinXSS-2).
In a similar fashion to the XP calculation, the X123 count rate per energy bin

where AX123 is the X123 aperture geometric area. The main diﬀerence between
XP and X123 in terms of the signal calculation is the spectral binning of the
data and the response function. (cid:60)X123(Eph, Ω, Edet), which is the photon ⇔
detected energy bin redistribution function and includes the FOV dependence
thru Ω. The function (cid:60)X123(Eph, Ω, Edet) maps Eph to Edet for forward
modeling and vice-versa, for inverting detected counts to create an incident
photon ﬂux estimate. Thus, the bracketed term in Equation 2 is only a
function of dEdet, because of the operation of (cid:60)X123(Eph, Ω, Edet) on the
source intensity S(Eph, Ω). Hence, the ﬁnal integral over the individual energy
bin energy limits, Emin,j and Emax,j to obtain a ﬁnal count rate value in
energy bin j. Again, in theory the integral over Eph in the bracket is over all
photon energies, but in reality, this is limited to the X123 spectral eﬃciency,
high and low photon limits.
Similarly, for X123 the combination of the X123 spectral eﬃciency (the
probability that a photon incident on the active area of the detector will be
absorbed) and the aperture geometric area can be used to create the eﬀective
area curves for MinXSS-1 and MinXSS-2 X123 in Figure 5. The edge near 1
keV in the MinXSS-2 X123 detector eﬀective area curve is due to a Zn
contamination in the Amptek supplied Be window and has been included in
the modeling. The primary spectral range is nominally 0.5 - 30 keV for both
MinXSS spacecraft X123 detectors, but it is obvious in Figure 5 that the
MinXSS-2 detector has a higher eﬃciency for the lower photon energies (Eph ≤
2 keV). This is due to the thinner 11.2 µm Be window on the MinXSS-2
detector as compared to the 24.5 µm thick window on MinXSS-1. The choice of
the thinner Be window X123 detector being on the second MinXSS was
intended, because MinXSS-2 has an anticipated longer misson of ∼5 years vs.
MinXSS-1 expected maximum mission lifetime of ∼1 year. The higher
eﬃciency for lower photon energies aids in extending the low energy limit of

Figure 5. MinXSS-1 and MinXSS-2 X-ray instrument eﬀective area vs. photon energy. The
main diﬀerence between the XP (dashed line) and X123 (solid line) is due to the geometric area
of their respective apertures. The XP aperture diameter is ∼5 mm, while the X123 pinhole
diameter is ∼0.18 mm. MinXSS-2 has an undesigned Zn contribution to the Be window, which
results in an edge in the response near 1 keV.

comparing the both the spectral and intensity sensitivities between various
instruments on diﬀerent observatories.

4.4. Detector Response Matrix

In reality, the resulting count space is discrete and not continuous after the
integration of the bracketed quantity in Equation 2 to create the binned data.
Thus, one can interpret the photon-count redistribution function as a Detector
Response Matrix (DRM) for the X123 spectrometer, with columns, k, that
connect the incident photon energy to the row, j, which are the loses recorded

C j is the detected
in the X123 energy bins. This is listed in Equation 4, where

MinXSS Instruments

−→
S k is the source intensity. An

count rate spectrum, (cid:60)k,j is the X123 DRM and
example of the MinXSS X123 DRM is displayed in Figure 6. The DRM
incorporates the detection eﬃciency, the probability that a photon stopped in
the detector by a photo-electric interaction will be recorded. The probability of
the full-energy being deposited in the detector gives the diagonal response or
photopeak eﬃciency. Additionally, there are loss processes such as ﬂuorescence
emission (Knoll, 2010), which result in an event being recorded at a lower
energy. These are the oﬀ-diagonal terms in the DRM and include loss processes
such as Si K and L (2s and 2p) escape. These loss processes result in counts
occurring at an energy bin that is the incident photon energy minus the Si
edge energy (∼1.8 keV for K, ∼0.15 keV for 2s, and ∼0.14 keV for 2p). These
spectral detection shifts occur if the resulting Si escape photon actually leaves
the active area of the detector without being absorbed, or else if the escape
photon is reabsorbed by the detector, one retains the original photon energy in
the detected energy bin.

Another process that we consider is the liberation of photoelectrons in the
X123 Be window that can eventually be detected and appear in the spectrum.
These events will occur at lower energies than the initial photon distribution
that created the photoelectrons due to the energy loss processes in migrating
to the window surface, the negative bias of the X123 detector front surface and
transport through the detector deadlayer. The resulting contribution would be
a continuum distribution at low energies (Eph ≤ 1.5 keV) for typical solar
ﬂuxes (peak in photon distribution) and window thicknesses (absorption
probability spectrum of window) on our X123 units. These model contributions
are included in the functional form of (cid:60)X123 and are also discussed in Moore
et al. (2016).
Another eﬀect in MinXSS spectra is Compton scattering, but to a much
smaller degree than Si-escape (both because of the lower probability and the
lack of detectable higher energy photons greater than 10 keV). Compton
scattering is unlikely to be a major contaminant in the quality of MinXSS
spectra due to the small eﬀective area of X123 coupled with the steeply
decreasing solar spectra at high energies. Only large X-class ﬂares could
produce large enough signal at photon energies greater than 10 keV to make
Compton scattering important, but other issues such as photon pile-up and
X123 dead-time will occur before that becomes relevant. We have used a ﬂux
linearity test at SURF to quantify when pile-up and detector dead-time will
become severe and discuss this in Section 4.6

4.5. Temperature Response

To connect the MinXSS instrument spectral response to the ability to detect
plasma of diﬀering temperatures, one can calculate a temperature response
curve. The temperature response curve is the signal expected in an instrument
from the plasma photon emission. This response curve is built as a function of

peak, Compton scattering, Be window generated photoelectrons, and Si K and L (2s and 2p)
escape processes. The DRM gives the probability that an incident photon of energy E1 will
deposit energy E2 in the detector.

plasma temperature iteratively, by using many isothermal emission models of
diﬀering temperatures. The temperature response curve is generated by using a
spectral synthesis model to create an X-ray emission proﬁle from physical
parameters (temperature, density, plasma emission measure, elemental
abundance, etc.) vs. photon energy, folding this through the MinXSS
instrument response and totaling the counts over a speciﬁed number of energy
bins (creating an eﬀective energy bin width for this model) for X123 and the
estimated fC for XP. In general, the spectral emission model used is computed
for a range of isothermal plasma temperatures. This grid of input temperatures
leads to a grid of MinXSS instrument counts per isothermal temperature.
Equation 5, Equation 6, and Equation 7 show the functional form of the
calculation to compute the temperature responses for XP and X123
respectively.

An example of the MinXSS XP and X123 temperature response curves are in
Figure 7. There are diﬀerences in the temperature response function depending
on the abundances used in spectral emission model for the soft X-rays are
primarily due to the variance in the low ﬁrst ionization potential (low-FIP)
elements of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca and the mid-FIP element S. Elements with a ﬁrst
ionization potential less than 10 eV have been measured to be overabundant
with respect to the high-FIP elements in the solar corona when compared to
photospheric values. This has become known as the FIP eﬀect in the Sun.
Summaries of the variations in Solar abundance are given by Laming (2015)
and Schmelz et al. (2012). Thus, we calculate the temperature response for a
range of abundances and display the abundance values corresponding to
‘common’ reference values in literature. Results displayed are for traditional
‘Coronal’ (Feldman, 1992) (4 times photospheric for the low-FIP elements),
‘Hybrid’ (Schmelz et al., 2012) (∼2.1 times photospheric), and one of the latest
photosphere (Caﬀau et al., 2011) abundances. The MinXSS instrument
temperature response begins to deviate for plasma temperatures greater than 2
MK, primarily due to the ions of the low-FIP elements.
Figure 7 demonstrates the temperature range over which MinXSS X123 and
XP can reliably extract information. X123 and XP inferences are biased
towards the plasma temperatures greater than 2 MK. The dominant emission
for non-large-ﬂaring-times is expected to be around 2 - 4 MK. Thus, MinXSS
will be able to infer non-large-ﬂaring Sun properties between 1.5 - ∼4 MK with
high conﬁdence, but limited capabilities for temperatures below 1.5 MK. The
temperature response is ﬂattens for the X123 lower energy bins (≤3 keV) for
temperatures greater than ∼4.5 MK. Due to this ﬂat nature and with limited
signiﬁcant counts from energy bins greater than 3 keV (which is not expected
from the X123 relatively small eﬀective area), X123 can only set upper limits
on the emission measure, but cannot deﬁnitively constrain the temperature
values for plasma hotter than ∼5 MK during non-large-ﬂaring times. Plasma
temperatures above ∼5 MK are expected for C, M and X class GOES ﬂares.
The higher energy bins (≥ 3 keV) are mostly sensitive to plasma temperatures
greater than ∼5 MK, but need substantial photon ﬂux for statistically
signiﬁcant signals. All these attributes demonstrate that MinXSS has the
greatest diagnostic capability for large ﬂares on the Sun.

4.6. Linearity of Response

It is desired to have a linear response vs. light source intensity levels for the
MinXSS instruments. The linearity of response for XP and X123 were assessed

C. S. Moore et al.

Figure 7. An example of the X123 and XP temperature response functions for a spectrum
summed to 0.3 keV wide bins for X123 (ten 0.03 native bins). The temperature response
is in volume emission measure units of cm−3. The isothermal spectral emission model used
to compute the spectral response of the MinXSS instruments per plasma temperature is a
spectrally extended version of the SolarSoftware (SSW) f vth function (which uses the Chianti
Atomic Database). The temperature response in soft X-rays can vary due to diﬀerences in the
abundance of the low-FIP elements of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca and the mid-FIP element S used in the
spectral emission model. Thus, we display the temperature response for traditional ‘Coronal’
(Feldman, 1992) (4 times photospheric for the low-FIP elements), ‘Hybrid’ (Schmelz et al.,
2012) (∼2.1 times photospheric), and one of the latest photospheric (Caﬀau et al., 2011)
abundances. The MinXSS instrument temperature response begins to deviate for diﬀerent
abundances for plasma temperatures greater than 2 MK, due to the ions of the low-FIP
elements.

at NIST SURF plus early data from the MinXSS-1 mission and the data for
the former are in Figure 8. The count rates discussed here are the measured
counts summed over the spectrum during an accumulation divided by the
accumulation time. MinXSS data products contain many types of time
parameters, but it is best to use the actual measured count rates (counts per
second; cps) to deduce the severity of dead-time and pile-up eﬀects vs. directly
using the time parameters in the data sets. The X123 spectral data can be
corrected for dead-time losses up until a maximum input count rate for the
slow counter, [Cs]max, which depends on the slow counter peaking time, τs.
The slow counter peaking time directly eﬀects the slow counter dead-time, τds,
via the relation τds = B(τs + τf lat), where B is a constant (over the mission)
per detector, and τf lat is the trapezoidal shaping ﬂat top time. The maximum
input count rate that the slow counter can be corrected for is [Cs]max = 1
τds
This corresponds to ∼85 000 cps for MinXSS-1 (4.8 µs peaking time) and ∼255
000 cps for MinXSS-2 (1.2 µs peaking time). Below, we discuss the dead-time
correction process with the NIST SURF data and the on-orbit speciﬁc
correction process.
The MinXSS-1 X123 has a JFET preampliﬁer and MinXSS-2 with the X123
Fast SDD unit has a MOSFET preampliﬁer, allowing for lower noise and
improved utility for shorter peaking times. The deduced non-dead-time
corrected maximum count rate for MinXSS-1 is ∼8 000 cps for its chosen 4.8

µs peaking time. The deduced non-dead-time corrected maximum count rate
for MinXSS-2 is ∼7 000 cps for the 4.8 µs peaking time and ∼27 000 cps for
the 1.2 µs peaking time. The latter will be the MinXSS-2 nominal operational
peaking time. The horizontal thick dotted lines in Figure 8 display these
non-dead-time corrected spectrally integrated maximum count rates. These
listed count rate values (Cs) are from the slow counter, which creates the X123
spectrum. The ‘input’ count rate (Cin) is determined from the measured fast
counter count rate (Cf ) corrected for fast counter dead-time (τdf ). The fast
counter has a shorter peaking time of 100 ns (τpf ) and an eﬀective pair
resolving time of ∼120 ns (τpair = τdf = 120 ns). The fast channel is used to
determine if each event is ‘valid’, if the X123 slow channel and hence the
Digital Pulse Processor should include it in the spectrum. This helps minimize
photon peak pile-up, where more than one photon is absorbed by the detector
within the peaking time and the event is recorded as the sum of the photon
energies. As a consequence of the much shorter peaking time, the fast channel

has much lower spectral resolution and thus is not the preferred channel for
accurate spectra accumulation.
All photon-counting X-ray detectors exhibit some form of count rate loss due
to dead-time (Knoll, 2010). At high count rates losses due to dead-time can
become signiﬁcant and expressions to approximate the true count rates for
X123 are provided by Redus, Huber, and Sperry (2008). The linear black solid
line in Figure 8 displays the relation between the input and dead-time
corrected fast counter output count rates. The dead-time correction for the fast
counter count rate follows the non-paralyzable model, Cin =
resembles the ‘true’ input count rate. This expression is accurate to within 5%
for true count rates ≤ 500 000 cps. For the NIST SURF calibrations we
calculate Cin directly from the fast counter and use Cmodel = Cine−Cinτds , the
paralyzable model, to directly estimate the count rate in the slow counter (Cs).
The expression for Cmodel assumes a Poisson arrival probability for photons
and registered events. The blue (MinXSS-1, τs = 4.8 µs) , green (MinXSS-2, τs
= 4.8 µs) and red (MinXSS-2, τs = 1.2 µs) solid lines in Figure 8 are the
calculated dead-time suppressed slow counts (Cmodel). The corresponding
measured slow counts (Cs) are the symbols.
Overall, these predictions agree with the measured data until pile-up eﬀects
cause the measured count rate to lie below the calculations. The resultant
pile-up eﬀects depend on the shape of the photon ﬂux spectrum, but in
general, will be noticeable for input count rate values greater than the peak
modeled count rate distribution Cmodel (the solid lines in Figure 8). This
occurs for Cin > 1
τds
release. Thus, in theory, if one has quality fast and slow counter measurements
during an observation the true count rate can be deduced to within 5% until
500 000 cps. Unfortunately, this NIST SURF procedure to correct the slow
counter for dead-time eﬀects is not directly applicable on-orbit because (1) the
low energy thresholds for the fast and the slow counter may not be (and
currently are not) at exactly the same energy, and (2) on-orbit the MinXSS-1
fast counter has exhibited high noise (radio beacons, reaction wheel
momentum changes, etc.) and thus cannot be used quantitatively, only
qualitatively. MinXSS-2 ground testing does not exhibit the same noise
characteristics and should have reduced fast counter noise on-orbit.
As an alternative to estimate the true spectrum count rate on-orbit one can
use the merit function in Equation 8, £, where n is the variable to estimate the
spectrally integrated slow counter count rate without dead-time depression, in
units of cps. The minimum of £ with the restriction that, Cs < n < 1

yield the input count rate (nmin), or ‘true’ count rate that best estimates the
measured spectrally integrated slow count rate, Cs. It is apparent from
Figure 8 that the model function Cmodel, is not monotonic nor uniquely deﬁned
for input count rates in the interval 0 < n < ∞. Thus, to obtain a feasible
result one must restrict the search domain to be between Cs < n < 1

quantity of the diﬀerence between the observed count rate and model count

Early MinXSS-1 data from diﬀerent GOES levels has been used to estimate the
blue vertical axis in Figure 8, which roughly relates the GOES 0.1 - 0.8 nm (W
m−2) ﬂux levels to the spectrally integrated MinXSS counts. The X123 counts
are totaled across the entire operational spectral bins (Eph (cid:38) 0.8 keV,) and not
limited to the corresponding GOES 0.1 - 0.8 nm band (1.55 - 12.4 keV). This
relation is to serve as a general guide of what count rates one would expect for
speciﬁc GOES levels and can plan for X123 eﬀects as necessary (photon peak
pile-up, dead-time, etc.). The MinXSS-2 estimates are modeled counts based on
the response functions and process described in Section 4.3, in Equation 2,
where the photon source term, S is generated from inverting the MinXSS-1
measured count spectrum. These rough estimates are displayed as the red
vertical axis in Figure 8. Examples of the count rate, and estimated photon
ﬂux as a function of GOES levels from the early aspects of the MinXSS-1
mission are discussed in Section 5.

4.7. MinXSS Data Products

The publicly available MinXSS data can be accessed on the MinXSS website
http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/minxss/. These data will include Level0c,
Level0d, Level1 - 5 products with one of the most relevant products being the
Level1 spectral irradiance (photons s−1 cm−2 keV−1). Measured count rates,
spacecraft position, Sun-Earth distance, pointing information, etc. are also
included. MinXSS data processing software to convert raw data to science
quality data will be incorporated into SSW soon.

5. MinXSS-1 Solar Measurements - GOES A5 - M5 Levels

The MinXSS X123 spectrometer prototype was space-ﬂight veriﬁed on two
NASA Sounding Rocket ﬂights for the calibration of the SDO Extreme
Variability Experiment (EVE) (Woods et al., 2012) and returned high quality
science data for two 5 minute periods (Caspi, Woods, and Warren, 2015). Thus,
we have conﬁdence in the MinXSS CubeSat versions of the X123 spectrometers
to return high quality data. This was reaﬃrmed with the ﬁrst few months of
data downlinked from the MinXSS-1 mission. Over the early phases of the

SOLA: minxss_instrument_paper_final_resubmit2.tex; 8 January 2018; 1:37; p. 23

mission the X-ray ﬂux has been as low as GOES ∼A5 and as high as GOES
M5.0 during a ﬂare. The times of the corresponding GOES levels are:

• A5 from 2016 June 29 10:29:32 - 2016 July 01 22:55:53,

C. S. Moore et al.

• B5 from 2016 July 23 01:15:05 - 01:39:45,

• C2.7 from 2016 July 08 - 00:55:04 - 00:58:44,

• M1.2 from 2016 July 21 - 01:50:01 - 01:53:31,

• M5.0 from 2016 July 23 - 02:10:05 - 02:13:46

These data have been ﬁltered and only data that pass our ‘science quality’
check (minimal background levels, particle events, non-SAA times, etc.) are
analyzed below. These ﬁlter checks also isolate eclipse time data with only
thermal noise apparent in the spectrum which result in ∼ 2 - 5 cps across the
entire spectrum. Other external (astronomical) soft-X-ray ﬂux contributions to
the MinXSS X123 background are negligible due to the small instrument
aperture. The solar ﬂare times are centered on the ﬂare peak total count rate
in the MinXSS X123 spectrum. These solar ﬂuxes have all been corrected for
dead-time losses using Equation 8 and result in MinXSS-1 X123 count rate
levels of 26 - 9 100 cps. The dead-time losses were ∼11% for the M5.0 ﬂare,
∼3% for the M1.2 ﬂare, ∼0.7% for the C2.7 ﬂare, and less than ∼0.5% for B
GOES levels and lower. This demonstrates the MinXSS spectrometer capability
to cover a wide range of solar X-ray ﬂux levels. XP responds identically to the
increasing GOES ﬂux, with background subtracted signals in the range of 801 -
616 928 fC. This provides a conﬁrmation of XP and X123 nominal operation.
Due to the X123 noise sources mentioned earlier, Be window thickness and
uncertainties in the photon inversion process, and to the oﬀ-diagonal elements
of the X123 response, the lower end of the MinXSS-1 X123 spectra valid for
scientiﬁc analysis is ∼0.8 keV. The sharply decreasing solar ﬂux for the higher
energies limit and the MinXSS small aperture result in an eﬀective high energy
limit of ∼12 keV. Even for ﬂares as large as M5.0, the ﬂux is not large enough
to produce a statistically signiﬁcant count rate above 12 keV before eﬀects
such as detector dead-time and pile-up hinder the accuracy of the spectra.
Thus, our MinXSS-1 X123 has an eﬀective solar ﬂux energy range of 0.8 - 12
keV and should return quality data up to low X-class ﬂares if corrected for
dead-time and pile-up eﬀects. The MinXSS-2 X123 Fast SDD spectrometer
with a nominal slow channel peaking time of 1.2 µs, is four times faster than
the nominal 4.8 µs peaking time, thus one would expect roughly four times the
count rate before inaccurate spectra. But the MinXSS-1 Be window is much
thicker than the MinXSS-2 window (24.5 vs. 11.2 µm), making comparisons
non-linear. Early estimates put the MinXSS-2 X123 maximum GOES level at
X-class solar ﬂares. Future data will reveal the full relation, keeping in mind
that the axis on Figure 8 are rough estimates and that the spectral distribution
of photons is non-linear vs. GOES ﬂux levels.

Figure 9. MinXSS-1 X123 solar measurements (solid lines) from GOES A5 to M5 levels
(∼5 × 10−8 - 5 × 10−5 W m−2). The left plot is the mean count ﬂux and the right plot is
the estimated photon ﬂux. The uncertainties are depicted as the shaded region around the
measurements. This demonstrates the dynamic range of the MinXSS-1 spectrometer, and the
variation in spectral features for increasing solar ﬂux levels. The ‘bumps’ in the spectrum are
due to groups of dominant emission lines from ionized Fe near 1.2 keV and 6.7 keV, Mg near
1.7 keV, Si around 2.1 keV, S by 2.7 keV, Ar (or lack thereof) near 3 keV, Ca by 4 keV, and the
Fe+Ni complex at 8 keV. These features can be used as elemental abundance probes to assess
deviations from the traditional ‘Coronal’ abundance values during various solar conditions.

The spectral photon ﬂux estimates in Figure 9 demonstrate the drastic change
in the soft-X-ray spectra. The X123 soft X-ray spectrum measured change by
orders of magnitude over a few GOES level changes. Additionally, the XP fA
signal (converted from the measured DN signal) scales with the GOES ﬂux
levels of A5 to M5. This provides a consistency check for the X123 spectral
signal. While the qualitative nature of this change is not new, the quantitative
determination of the magnitude of this change is relevant. Table 2 lists the
X123 and XP count rates as a function of GOES class and is plotted in
Figure 9. The measured XP signal was compared to the X123 estimated XP
signal, by taking the X123 estimated photon ﬂux and computed the XP signal
from this ﬂux. The resultant ‘X123 modeled’ XP signal is then compared to
the measured XP signal. The XP measured and ‘X123 modeled’ XP signal
agree to within ∼4% except for the GOES A5 measurement. At low GOES
levels the XP signal becomes comparable to the thermal photodiode noise and
leads to underestimated signals. This is apparent in the QS emission measure
inferences discussed in detail in Section 5.3.
A particularly interesting feature in the X123 spectrum is the presence of two
‘humps’ near 1.7 keV due to Mg XI and Mg XII line groups, and 2.1 keV from
Si XIII and Si XIV lines. These hump features persist for all GOES levels and
provide useful diagnostics for element abundance estimations. The Fe XXIV
and Fe XXV line complex near 6.7 keV is prominent for the GOES ﬂares of
levels C2.7 and higher. This line complex is well suited to estimate the Fe
abundance modiﬁcation during solar ﬂares vs. the QS (non-large-ﬂaring Sun).

Only for the brightest ﬂares (M5.0 and M1.2 in this paper) is the Fe-Ni
complex near 8.0 keV pronounced and suitable for analysis. For smaller ﬂares
the signal is not statistically signiﬁcant to infer physical properties from this
feature. These measurements demonstrate the MinXSS dynamic range of its
solar measurements.

5.1. Soft X-ray Energy Content and Correlation to GOES XRS

A main beneﬁt of conducting routine spectrally resolved soft X-ray
measurements is the ability to calculate and track the spectral distribution of
energy ﬂux. This information is important for models of Earth’s atmospheric
response to solar radiative forcing, solar ﬂare analyses and comparison of the
solar X-ray ﬂux to other stars. Table 2 lists the integrated soft X-ray energy
ﬂux (multiplying the energy ﬂux by the X123 bin width and summing over
photon energy bins) above 1 keV estimated at 1 AU from MinXSS-1 X123
measurements for the main ﬁve GOES levels. This information is also in Panel
A of Figure 10. Panel B displays the ﬁtted power law relationship, y = a(xb),
between the MinXSS-1 X123 total counts and the total radiative energy
greater than 1 keV energy, which is not quite linear. The data in the scatter
plots (Panels B, C and D) are from 2016 June 10 - 2016 November 30. The
coeﬃcient of 2.2 × 10−8 J counts−1 m−2 can be used to obtain a rough
estimate of the energy content from the X123 total counts alone. A large
portion of this energy (up to an order of magnitude) resides below 2 keV and
this is apparent when comparing to the corrected (divided by 0.7) GOES XRS
0.1 - 0.8 nm ﬂux, see Panel A in Figure 10.
There is a correlation between the 0.1 - 0.8 nm (∼1.55 - 12.4 keV) energy ﬂux
calculated from MinXSS-1 X123 and GOES XRS (Panel D of Figure 10). The
XP count rate (DN s−1) has a near linear relationship to the GOES XRS 0.1 -
0.8 nm ﬂux, especially above GOES B1 levels and is useful as a proxy to the
GOES XRS measurements. This is expected as XP tracks the total soft X-ray
energy incident on the MinXSS-1 aperture (number of electron-hole pairs
generated is proportional to Eph). Exact linearity is not expected between
X123 count rate and GOES XRS energy ﬂux because X123 is photon counting.
These results validate the dynamic response of the MinXSS-1 X123 and XP to
the solar ﬂux. The next section discusses the feasibility of extracting physical
information from model ﬁts of the MinXSS X123 data to estimate plasma
temperature, density, emission measure and elemental abundances.

5.2. Spectral Parametric Fits

Hinode XRT Be-thin images are displayed in Figure 11 to provide qualitative
spatial context for the X-ray emission that MinXSS detects for
non-large-ﬂaring times. The XRT Be-thin serves as the closest XRT synoptic
ﬁlter analog to the MinXSS spectral response. The four panels in Figure 11 are
the closest XRT full-Sun synoptic images in time to the QS (Panel A), pre-ﬂare
C2.7 (Panel B), pre-ﬂare M1.2 (Panel C) and pre-ﬂare M5.0 (Panel D) times.
It is clear that active regions are present, their emission dominate the MinXSS

units - W m−2 keV−1) and scaled back to the Solar surface (in cgs units - erg s−1 cm−2

count rates (due to the hotter plasma content). We are currently working to
cross-calibrate the two instruments to develop quantitative relationships. With
this knowledge we proceed to demonstrate an example of how MinXSS data
can be used to extract physical information on the X-ray emitting regions.
The unique spectrally resolved measurements of MinXSS are suitable for
parametric ﬁts of single temperature (1T), two temperature (2T),
multi-temperature (multi-T) and diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) models
to estimate the plasma conditions. QS, AR and ﬂare data over the possible
total 6 year MinXSS mission combined with data from the observatories
mentioned in Section 1.1 can be used to address current questions in solar
physics. We have performed a series of parametric ﬁts using the OSPEX
(https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssw/packages/spex/doc/ospex explanation.htm)
programming suite in Solar Software, which utilizes the Chianti Atomic
Database (Del Zanna et al., 2015; Young et al., 2016), on the seven sets
(includes pre-ﬂare times) of data described earlier from GOES A5 to M5 levels.
The uncertainties calculated on the ﬁt parameters in this paper are basic
OSPEX returned ﬁts uncertainties, based on the curvature matrix, which
assumes that the curvature has a local Gaussian shape.
We have used four models to ﬁt the respective observations for comparisons
between models. The best ﬁt values are listed in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5,
Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14. In this analysis we denote a FIP-Bias value
of 1 equal to photospheric which would have values similar to those in Caﬀau
et al. (2011) and FIP-Bias of 4 equal to the traditional ‘Coronal’ abundance

and are those of Feldman (1992). The ﬁrst model is a simple one temperature,
ﬁxed coronal abundance (1T-Coronal; AF IP = 4) model, which did not ﬁt the
data suitably for any of the seven data sets. There were large discrepancies for
the elemental features labeled in Figure 9. The second model is a single
temperature model in which the abundance of low FIP elements is allowed to
vary through a single multiplicative factor, called the FIP-Bias. This model is
called 1T-Free, but it underestimates the pre-ﬂare ﬂux for photon energies
greater than ∼2.5 keV. The same 1T-Free model did not ﬁt the ﬂare
components well neither. For the times where there is not substantial counts
for X123 energy bins > 2.5 keV, like the QS ﬂux (GOES ∼A5) the 1T-Free
model provides an adequate ﬁt.
The third model is a two temperature component with a single multiplicative
factor for the FIP-Bias (2T-Free). These ﬁts consistently produce satisfactory
results with reduced χ2 between 1 - 4, except for the M5.0 ﬂare. All pre-ﬂare
spectra in this paper are ﬁt over the times listed in Table 3 with a 2T-Free
model. The ﬂare-peak ﬁts include an additional 2T-Free model that is ﬁt to
account for the additional radiation on top of the ﬁxed model pre-ﬂare values.
In this methodology the ﬁxed pre-ﬂare model during the peak-ﬂare times
serves as a background estimate. Thus, the result is a separate FIP-Bias for the
2T-Free pre-ﬂare and the ﬂare-peak functions. Values near 4 for this ﬁt class
resemble traditional coronal values and values near 1 are photospheric.
The abundance models are sensitive to the ‘humps’ from emission line groups
of Fe, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Ni (where applicable) around ∼1.2 6.7 and 8.1,
1.7, 2.1, 2.7, 3.0, 4.0, and 8.1 keV respectively. For the 2T-Free model, a FIP
bias value of 3.48 is found for the QS spectra, for the pre-ﬂare times values
between 2.0 - 3.5 are obtained and lower values between ∼1 - 1.41 are obtained
for the peak-ﬂare spectral ﬁts. It is clear that there is a diﬀerence in the
estimated abundance from pre-ﬂare to ﬂare-peak and the lower abundance
during the ﬂare is consistent with recent literature (Schmelz et al., 2012;
Dennis et al., 2015; Woods et al., 2017). The availability of the Fe and Fe+Ni
complexes at 6.7 and 8.1 keV respectively, provide clear diagnostics for the
abundance factors and in turn are weighted more heavily for the ﬂare
abundances. The lower abundance is also in line with the theory of plasma
from the lower atmosphere ﬂowing up to the higher layers of the atmosphere
and radiating in X-rays and UV.
The forth model type is a two temperature component where each of the
elements, Fe, Ca, S, Mg, Si, Ar and Ni are allowed to vary (2T-AllFree) as long
as there are suﬃcient counts in the X123 energy bins for the respective
element’s line group features in the spectrum. It is important to note that the
Ni abundance scale factor is coupled to the Fe abundance scale factor. Thus,
the Ni abundance is not a true independent inference. This is heritage in the
ﬁtting routine for the Fe+Ni complex near 8.0 keV and does not strongly skew
the ﬁts. The 2T-AllFree temperature and emission results are in Table 4, the
elemental abundance results in Table 5, the spectral ﬁts in Figure 12 and the
comparison to em loci in Figure 14. The separate abundance values are in
abundance ratio units of coronal/photospheric, where the coronal values are
from Feldman (1992) and the photospheric values are from Caﬀau et al. (2011).

SOLA: minxss_instrument_paper_final_resubmit2.tex; 8 January 2018; 1:37; p. 29

C. S. Moore et al.

For the QS spectra, there are not enough counts for energies (cid:61) 2.5 keV and
not ‘strong enough’ features for a consistent ﬁt and thus the individual element
abundance parameters are poorly constrained. But for the pre-ﬂare spectra and
ﬂares statistically signiﬁcant abundance values can be deduced. Again the
trend is clear that there is a decrease in the abundance majority of the low-FIP
elements (Fe, Si, Mg, Ni) during the ﬂare-peak vs. the pre-ﬂare ﬁts.
Additionally, the individual element abundance variation observed provides
further evidence for a more complicated fractionation process than a simple
single FIP-Bias scaling for all the low-FIP elements. Similar conclusions about
abundances being more complex than a FIP-Bias scaling have been expressed
in recent studies, such as in Schmelz et al. (2012) and Dennis et al. (2015).
This is further complicated by the postulated decrease in abundance from the
nominal coronal/photospheric ratio of Ar for the three ﬂares here and Ca for
two of the three ﬂares. The abundances of Ar and Ca have been of recent
interest in Hinode EIS spectrum (Doschek, Warren, and Feldman, 2015;
Doschek and Warren, 2016) and MinXSS can provide an additional diagnostic
in investing any anomalous behavior. A more rigorous analysis of elemental
abundance variations, solar ﬂares, quiescent conditions and active region
evolution comprising DEM ﬁts and will occur in the future.
The MinXSS-1 X123 spectral ﬁts of the non-ﬂaring Sun are consistent with a
dominant emission component between 1 - 3 MK with volume emission
measure values near 1049 - 1050 cm−3, which is not surprising. To highlight the
limit of inference in these simple 2T models, we include the more uncertain
hotter ((cid:39) 4.5 MK), dimmer ((cid:47) 1048 cm−3) secondary component. With this
secondary component, the model ﬁts the data well with reasonable χ2 values.
Without this secondary temperature component, the 1T models underestimate
the measured count rate above 2.5 keV, albeit a DEM ﬁt could reconcile this
excess. The ability of MinXSS data alone to constrain this contribution is
limited (due to the small eﬀective area) and can only provide upper limits to
the emission measure. We caution against the magnitude of the emission
measure of this hot-dim component derived from 2T ﬁts from MinXSS data
alone and signify this with ** in Table 3 and Table 4 on the ﬁt parameters and
a dash-dot delta function without a black outline in Figure 14). Conclusive
evidence of its existence can be provided by simultaneous observations from
other more sensitive instruments. The purpose of this article is to highlight the
MinXSS capabilities, but this also encompasses uncovering the limitations.
We checked the estimated GOES XRS 0.05 - 0.4 nm ﬂux for the MinXSS 2T
inferred pre-ﬂare secondary hot-dimmer components using the goes ﬂuxes.pro
IDL code. The measured ﬂuxes from the GOES 0.05 - 0.4 nm channel would
have to be between at least 2.2, 2.9, and 4.2 × 10−9 W m−2 (for photospheric
abundances) for the pre-ﬂare times of C2.7, M1.2 and M5.0 for this component
to have the emission measure similar to the MinXSS 2T-AllFree ﬁts. All
measured GOES 0.05 - 0.4 nm ﬂuxes were at about factor of 2 below the
estimated values. Spectral ﬁts to accommodate the measured count rate above
2.5 keV is most likely reconciled by DEM ﬁts of MinXSS data coupled with
other soft X-ray data. This will be done soon.

Figure 12. MinXSS-1 X123 count ﬂux solar measurements (solid lines) with the best ﬁt
spectra overlaid (dashed lines), for temperature and emission measures derived using the
OSPEX suite. The residuals are listed also (M = model, D = data, and E = uncertainty). The
shaded regions indicate the uncertainties in the count ﬂux. A 2T model with select elemental
abundance ﬁt separately (2T-AllFree). The best ﬁt parameters with their uncertainties are
listed in Table 4 and Table 5. There is a 2T model used for non-large-ﬂaring times (QS and
pre-ﬂare) and an additional 2T model is added to compensate for the radiative enhancement
during the ﬂare-peak times. The vertical dash-dot-dot-dot lines show the high and low energy
limits for the spectral ﬁts.

There has been numerous literature discussing active region hot components
(T (cid:61) 5 MK) inferred from soft X-ray data (see Caspi, Woods, and Warren
(2015); Miceli et al. (2012); Reale et al. (2009); Schmelz et al. (2009a,b, 2015)
to state a few and references therein). All of these aforementioned studies had
their respective limitations. Future measurements from the MaGIXS
(Kobayashi et al., 2011) sounding rocket and continued measurements from
FOXSI (Ishikawa et al., 2014) sounding rockets, plus the NuSTAR satellite
(Hannah et al., 2016) will provide additional data to validate or further the
case to rebuke the previous claims of the hot-dim plasma’s presence, or at the
very least, provide ﬁrm upper limits on its emission measure. The only
substantial inkling seems to be from the Extreme Ultraviolet Normal Incidence
Spectrograph (EUNIS-13) (Brosius, Daw, and Rabin, 2014) and most recent
FOXSI (Ishikawa et al., 2017) rocket ﬂights. MinXSS data combined with the
other soft X-ray and UV observatories can help to further constrain the
existence of hot-dim plasma and investigate the solar plasma temperature
distribution. MinXSS data combined with the other soft X-ray and UV
observatories can help to further constrain the existence of hot-dim and
investigate the solar plasma temperature distribution.
The peak-ﬂare emission in this paper is best described by a persistent cooler
component between 3 - 7 MK plus a hotter contribution ((cid:61) 13 MK) that

dominates at the higher energy ﬂux. All ﬂare data analyzed in this paper cover
about a 3 - 4 minute time-frame centered about the peak soft X-ray emission
times. Reﬁnement of the MinXSS-1 spectral responses is a continual endeavor,
particularly for high ﬂux times, such as the M5.0 ﬂare (which is currently the
highest ﬂux observation that we have analyzed thoroughly). The deviations
near values of 5 between the uncertainty normalized diﬀerence between the
model and observations for the Si 2.1 and the Fe 6.7 keV features exhibit the
need for further improvement.
A further check of the MinXSS-1 ﬂare measurements is provided with a
comparison to near simultaneous RHESSI measurements. RHESSI results are
overlaid as ‘R’ in Figure 14 for the M1.2 and M5.0 ﬂares, which were the only
ﬂares in this paper simultaneously observed by both MinXSS-1 and RHESSI.
The RHESSI ﬁts were performed in OSPEX, composed of a 1T thermal and a
non-thermal (thick2) bremsstrahlung component. The spectra were ﬁt from ∼6
keV to the maximum photon energy with signal above the background (∼30
keV). The RHESSI thermal ﬁt components yield values near GOES estimates
(White, Thomas, and Schwartz, 2005) and the MinXSS-1 em loci curves
(discussed in Section 5.3). RHESSI estimates a temperature of 15 MK for both
ﬂares and emission measure values of 0.1 and 2.5 × 1049 cm−3 respectively for
the M1.2 and M5.0 ﬂare. RHESSI ﬁts indicate an elemental abundance
FIP-Bias factors of 2.1 and 1.3 for the M1.2 and M5.0 ﬂares respectively, both
below ‘traditional’ coronal values.
It is not expected for MinXSS-1 and RHESSI to return the exact same
temperature and emission measure values due to the diﬀerent spectral
responses, spectral resolution, eﬀective areas and consequential temperature
sensitivities, but one expects consistencies in RHESSI plasma parameters with
MinXSS em loci and inferred photon ﬂux. MinXSS-1 and RHESSI photon ﬂux
in Figure 15 provides one of the few spectrally complete ﬂare measurements
from 1 keV to at least 15 keV. The combined MinXSS-1 and RHESSI dynamic
range spans nearly eight dex of photon ﬂux and there is overlap near the 6.7
keV Fe complex. The ∼8 keV Ni feature is also apparent in the MinXSS-1
spectra. Similarly, RHESSI data can be used to extract non-thermal
contributions to the MinXSS-1 spectra for large ﬂares. The discussion of the
instrument complexities, and cross calibration between MinXSS and RHESSI is
reserved for a future paper (Amir et al., in prep).

5.3. Emission Measure Loci

Emission measure loci (em loci) provide a powerful diagnostic and a useful
visualization tool to understand a spectral instrument’s capability to infer
plasma temperature distribution from a speciﬁc set of observations (Warren
and Brooks, 2009; Landi and Klimchuk, 2010). Em loci can be calculated by
taking the measured data (summed counts over a speciﬁed energy range for
X123 or the total signal for XP) and dividing by the instrument’s temperature
response calculated for that energy range, for the corresponding best ﬁt
elemental abundance and emission model, emloci = Counts

The solid colored lines correspond to X123 counts summed to 0.3 keV wide energy bins and

the color code for the minimum energy bin use for each X123 em loci. The em loci indicate
the maximum emission if all the plasma was isothermal for each summed energy bins. GOES
averaged values are listed for photospheric (pentagon) and coronal (square) abundances. The
plot of X123 1T-Free ﬁts are to demonstrate, 1) the agreement with the overlapping X123 em
loci, 2) agreement with the overlapping XP em loci and 3) consistency with the GOES XRS
isothermal estimation except for low GOES levels like the ∼A5 levels (due to the non-linearity
of GOES for low ﬂux levels).

best ﬁt 2T-Free emission measure results. The diﬀerent colors show the em loci
of the various summed 0.3 keV wide energy bins (counts from ∼10 X123 bins
summed) with a signiﬁcant count rate ((cid:61) 0.05 counts per second per nominal
bin), which depict the energy ranges that best restrict the emission at speciﬁc
temperatures. In general the higher X123 energies are better for inferring the
hotter plasma conditions.
If the plasma was isothermal, then one would expect an isothermal ﬁt to
‘touch’ (or overlap with) the em loci at the corresponding temperature value.
Additionally, where the various em loci curves for diﬀerent energy bins intersect
is roughly the location that yield the isothermal temperature and emission
measure that best describe the plasma. In the case of large ﬂares during peak
emission times, we expect the ﬂaring plasma to dominate the solar spectral
emission. Thus, a 1T model result would peak near this value and this is what
was observed for the 1T models. The 1T-Free model for the QS and 3 pre-ﬂare
times are displayed in Figure 13 to exemplify this (the diamond symbols). The
values for all the pre-ﬂare times are near 3 MK and coincide with the GOES
XRS isothermal estimates for coronal (squares) and photospheric (pentagons)
abundances. Moreover, the X123 1T-Free values lie in between the GOES XRS
coronal and photospheric estimates, as they should because the ﬁt results for
X123 reside in between coronal and photospheric FIP-Bias values. The 3 MK

The ﬂare-peak GOES estimates are all lower temperature, higher emission
measure and closer to the region where the MinXSS X123 em loci come close to
intersecting for the three ﬂare times. The X123 loci straddle the em loci both
above and below the GOES values. 1T ﬁts for X123 during the ﬂare-peak times
are similar to the GOES estimates, but are not shown because of the poor ﬁt
to the X123 ﬂare spectra. The RHESSI ﬁt results are also plotted for the M1.2
and M5.0 ﬂare. The RHESSI estimates are hotter for the M1.2 ﬂare than both
MinXSS components and GOES, and the M5.0 ﬂare is consistent with GOES
estimates, but both RHESSI estimates are consistent with the MinXSS em loci.

These near simultaneous measurements provide complete spectral coverage from 1 keV to the
minimum detected ﬂux from RHESSI and spans eight orders of magnitude in ﬂux. The main
overlap between instruments for ﬂares is near the 6.7 keV Fe complex. This comparison helps
validate the MinXSS observations.

The consistency between X123 and XP em loci provide further conﬁdence that
both instruments are performing nominally. The minimum of all the em loci for
the MinXSS-1 X123 energy bins provides an upper limit to any
multi-temperature and DEM ﬁts. The energy must be spread over a range of
temperatures and thus could not ‘touch’ the em loci at any point. Thus em loci
provide ﬁrm upper limits to the temperature distribution for a particular
measurement from a particular instrument. Em loci are not a new tool, they
have been used most notably in XRT, EIS, AIA, FOXSI, RHESSI and
NuSTAR analysis to name a few. Em loci can be a valuable aid in MinXSS
data analysis.

6. Summary

The MinXSS CubeSats can provide the solar community with a new set of
measurements that can augment current and future investigations of the solar
corona. The SPS ancillary instrument, the X-ray detectors of XP and X123
have been characterized. The ﬁrst version of MinXSS, MinXSS-1, has
performed nominally over its mission at LEO. This paper describes the
MinXSS instrument suite, the X123 FOV sensitivity, X123 spectral resolution
vs. photon energy, XP and X123 eﬀective area curves, X123 detector response
matrix, XP and X123 temperature response, the X123 linearity of response,
GOES ﬂux levels vs. MinXSS-1 X123 measured integrated counts, and
MinXSS-2 X123 estimated counts, inferred temperature and emission measures
from MinXSS spectra, and emission measure loci for the discussed data. These
realizations further the notion that CubeSats can conduct signiﬁcant targeted
science. A summary of the main attributes of MinXSS are listed below.

1. MinXSS-1 X123 has an eﬀective solar ﬂux energy range of 0.8 - 12 keV

(∼0.10 - 1.55 nm) with resolving power ∼40 at 5.9 keV, and with dead-time
corrections applied accurate spectra up to low GOES X levels (but need to
correct for pulse-pileup).

2. The MinXSS CubeSats X123 have a relatively higher spectral resolution
over a fairly broad bandpass that allow inference of elemental abundance
values for the elements Fe, Ca, Si, Mg, S, Ar and Ni, when there are
suﬃcient counts at X123 energies for their respective line groups. The
observed elemental abundance variation in this work:

• clearly demonstrate a decrease in low FIP elements for ﬂare-peak times

vs. the pre-ﬂare values for spectral ﬁts with a single FIP-Bias
multiplicative factor

• display variance in the fractionation pattern among the low FIP elements

when all elements are allowed to vary for GOES levels > B1.

3. MinXSS-1 X123 ﬂare measurements in this paper indicate that the hotter
components in the ﬂaring plasma for the C2.7, M1.2 and M5.0 ﬂares bare
peak temperatures near 15, 13 and 20 MK, respectively.

4. MinXSS-1 X123 and XP plasma temperatures inferences are self consistent

and single X123 temperature ﬁts (1T-Free) are comparable with GOES XRS
isothermal estimates between GOES ∼B1 - M5 levels (GOES XRS response
becomes non-linear for lower ﬂux levels). However, these single temperature
ﬁts can not account for high energy X123 spectral counts nor are suitable
ﬁts for an entire ﬂare spectrum alone.

5. MinXSS X123 can infer non-large-ﬂaring Sun properties between 1.5 - 4 MK
with high conﬁdence, but limited capabilities for temperatures below 1.5
MK (due to limited sensitivity at lower energies, < 1 keV).

SOLA: minxss_instrument_paper_final_resubmit2.tex; 8 January 2018; 1:37; p. 39

C. S. Moore et al.

6. MinXSS X123 can only set upper limits on the emission measure and cannot
deﬁnitively constrain the temperature values for ‘dimmer’ plasma hotter
than ∼5 MK during non-large-ﬂaring times. This is due to the ﬂattening
nature of the temperature response above ∼4.5 MK for energy bins less than
3 keV and limited signiﬁcant counts from energy bins greater than 3 keV.
The latter is a consequence of the relatively small X123 aperture area (2.5 ×
10−4 cm2).

The anticipated mission length for MinXSS-1 was 1 year. The second version,
MinXSS-2, has improved hardware, software, and detectors (see Section 6.1).
The anticipated duration of the Sun-synchronous orbit for MinXSS-2 is 5
years, providing a possible total of 6 years of near continuous measurements.
The MinXSS-1 Level-1 products are available on the MinXSS website:
http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/minxss/.

6.1. Improvements of MinXSS-2

The MinXSS-2 X123 has a thinner Be window along with a lower noise
preampliﬁer that will provide an improved low energy response, possibly
extending the low energy limit to 0.6 keV. The newer preampliﬁer for the
MinXSS-2 X123 Fast SDD detector allows for a better spectral resolution for
the same nominal peaking time as the MinXSS-1 X123. We will be operating a
shorter peaking time for the MinXSS-2 X123 that will allow for accurate
spectra for a higher input ﬂux. Preliminary estimates suggest GOES levels
around X2 are the maximum that the MinXSS-1 X123 can handle before the
spectra will need further processing to retain ﬁdelity.

A. SPS Architecture and Position Calculation

The SPS quad Si-photodiode detector assembly is used to calculate the solar
position in the MinXSS FOV. SPS sits behind a ND7 ﬁlter (attenuation of a
factor of 107) to limit the visible-light ﬂux and eliminate all other
electromagnetic contributions to the signal. SPS relies on the visible-light
emission from the Sun to estimate the solar location within the FOV position
by calculating α and β. Figure 16 shows the basic SPS layout of the quad
diode assembly with a square 2 × 2 mm aperture. SPS has no focusing optics
and thus its operating principle relies upon measuring the relative light
detected on each of the four diodes Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 to calculate solar disc
location. Equation 9 and Equation 10 display the relation between the quad
diode signal to the α and β coordinates, which must be scaled by the known
maximum angular deviation αmax and βmax. The maximum angular deviation
is set by the geometrical layout of the aperture with respect to the quad
diodes. For an aperture of width, w, height, h and separation between the
photodiode and aperture along the optical path, d, the maximum angles can be
calculated from Equation 11 and Equation 12.
