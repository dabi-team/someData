Abstract 

Si-Ge monolayers (SiGeM) with different elementary proportion x (0<x<1) were systematically 

studied for the first-time using ab initio calculations in this work. The structural stabilities of the 

Si1-xGexM  with  different  symmetries  were  investigated  using  phonon  spectra,  and  an  infinite 

miscibility  between  Si  and  Ge  elements  were  revealed  in  the  2D  honeycomb  structures.  The 

simulated  scanning tunneling  microscope  images  and  Raman and  infrared  active modes  of  the 

Si1-xGexM  were  then  obtained  for  structural  characterizations.  Interestingly,  the  study  of 

electronic properties revealed not previously reported oscillatory nonlinear dependence of band 

gap values on the elementary proportion x in the Si1-xGexM, which suggests an alternative way 

for  tuning  the  band  gaps  of  2D  materials.  Additionally,  low  effective  masses  (0.008m0  ~ 

0.021m0) of the carriers in the semiconducting Si1-xGexM were found, which has potentials for 

high-speed applications. Considering the advantage of their compatibility with current Si-based 

1 

 
technology and the trend of miniature of electronic devices, the Si1-xGexM with stable structures 

and excellent properties would be important for 2D applications based on group IV materials.

INTRODUCTION 

The  saga  of  semiconductor  has  prevailed  since  1947.  Nowadays,  most  of  the  discrete 

electronic devices and integrated circuits are made of silicon (Si) bulk because of its abundance 

in  the  earth  crust  and  superior  physical  properties  including  low  band  gap,  high  mobility  and 

robust tunability by doping. Meanwhile, germanium (Ge), another important group IV element 

which has infinite miscibility with Si in three-dimensional (3D) SiGe alloys, provide important 

versatilities and more functionalities. In fact, Si1-xGex (0<x<1) alloys have been widely used for 

high-speed  semiconductor  transistors.1,2   Probably  stimulated  by  the  great  success  of  Si-based 

semiconductors in 3D, the two-dimensional (2D) counterparts of group IV elements have been 

explored for decades. As early as in 1994, K. Takeda and K. Shiraishi first proposed that Si and 

Ge could form corrugated honeycomb structures.3 This work did not attract much attention until 

graphene  was  discovered4  and  2D  materials  generated  a  lot  of  interest.  Nowadays,  2D 

honeycomb structures of Si atoms and Ge atoms, i.e., silicene and germanene, respectively, have 

been  extensively  studied.5-35  Theoretical  investigations  have  revealed  interesting  properties  of 

silicene  and  germanene  such  as  band  topology,6,7  quantum  Hall  effects,6  quantum  anomalous 

Hall effect,8 valley-spin polarization,9 band gap tuning by biaxial strain and electric field,10 and 

chemical  functionalization.11  Experimental  synthesis  of  silicene  and  germanene  has  also  been 

reported. For instance, silicene have been grown on Ag (110)  surface,12 ZrB2 (0001) thin films 

on  Si  substrates,13  Ag  (111)  surface,14-21  Ru  surface,22  Ir  (111)  substrate23  and  graphite.24 

Germanene  have  been  fabricated  on  Pt  (111)  surface,25,26  Au  (111)  surface,27  Ag  (111) 

surface,28,29  Sb(111)  surface30,  MoS2  Surface,31,32  Ge(110)  surface33  and  Cu  (111)  surface.34  

Atomic-level silicene field-effect transistors have also been demonstrated.35,36 However, most of 

the  work  has  been  focused  on  silicene  and/or  germanene,  but  not  the  binary  honeycomb 

3 

 
structures  of  Si  and  Ge  atoms,  i.e.,  Si-Ge  monolayers  (SiGeM).  The  Si1-xGexM  with  different 

elementary proportion x (0<x<1) have been relatively unexplored. The stabilities and miscibility, 

the  structural  characteristics  and  the  electronic  properties  of  the  2D  Si1-xGexM  still  remain 

unknown. 

In this work, Si1-xGexM (0<x<1) were systematically explored for the first-time using ab initio 

calculations.  The  structural  stabilities  of the  Si1-xGexM  with  different  symmetries were  studied 

and the first 2D binary system with an infinite miscibility between two elements (Si and Ge) was 

revealed in the honeycomb structures. Then, the simulated scanning tunneling microscope (STM) 

images  and  Raman  and  infrared  active  modes  of  the  Si1-xGexM  were  calculated  for  future 

experimental verifications. Finally, the electronic properties of the Si1-xGexM were investigated.  

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS 

Our  density-functional  theory  (DFT)  based  first  principles  calculations  were  performed  by 

Vienna  ab  initio  simulation  package  (VASP).37,38  The  projector  augmented  wave  (PAW) 

potentials were adopted to describe the core electrons. The generalized gradient approximation 

(GGA)  of  Perdew,  Burke,  and  Ernzernhof  (PBE)39  and  PBE  with  the  spin-orbit  coupling 

(PBE+SOC) were adopted to describe the exchange and correlation potentials, respectively. The 

cutoff  energy  for  expansion  of  the  wavefunction  into  plane  waves  is  set  to  be  500  eV  in  all 

simulations. In the calculations of the self-consistent field potential and total energy, we use a set 

of (25×25×1) k-point sampling to carry out Brillouinzone (BZ) integral in K space. Here the k-

point mesh is generated by Monkhorst-Pack scheme.40 The vacuum layer of 15 Å is selected to 

avoid the interlayer interaction of neighboring supercells. The tolerance for electron convergence 

was set as 1.0E-6eV, and the force was converged within  -1.0E-3eV/ Å, so the atomic position 

4 

 
and cell shape of experimental data were fully relaxed. We used VASP and density functional 

perturbation  theory  (DFPT)  implemented  in  PHONONPY  package41  to  get  the  phonon 

dispersion,  vibration  modes  and  the  Raman  frequency  at  the  Γ  point.  To  obtain  the  force 

constants for the phonon spectra calculations, atomic displacements of 0.01 Å were employed. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

In  order  to  explore  the  structural  stabilities  of  the  Si1-xGexM,  the  symmetries  of  the  low-

buckled  structures  composed  of  Si  and  Ge  atoms  were  first  studied.  Starting  from  a  2×2×1 

supercell of silicene with 8 atoms (see Figure 1), when a Si atom in the supercell is replaced by a 

Ge  atom,  there  are  3  possible  configurations  and  the  Ge  concentration  is  12.5%.  Keeping  on 

doing  this  step  by  step,  we  can  obtain  totally  86  possible  configurations  and  7  different  Ge 

concentrations.  The  SiGeM  with  different  Ge  concentrations  are  Si0.875Ge0.125M,  Si0.75Ge0.25M, 

Si0.625Ge0.375M,  Si0.5Ge0.5M,  Si0.375Ge0.625M,  Si0.25Ge0.75M  and  Si0.125Ge0.875M,  respectively. 

Symmetry  analysis  shows  that  Si0.875Ge0.125M  and  Si0.125Ge0.875M  have  P3m1  symmetry, 

Si0.75Ge0.25M  and  Si0.25Ge0.75M  have  C2/m,  Pm  and  P-3m1(D3d  point  group:C3,  3C2,  3σ,  i) 

symmetries,  Si0.625Ge0.375M  and  Si0.375Ge0.625M  have  Cm  and  P3m1(C3v  point  group:C3,  3σ) 

symmetries, and Si0.5Ge0.5M have the most abundant symmetries of  P21/m, Cm,  C2,  P2/m  and 

P3m1. Among all the symmetries, P3m1 and P-3m1 have the highest symmetry and correspond 

to the case of nearly uniformly doped structures with highest entropy. 

5 

 
 
 
All  the  structures  were  optimized  and  the  cohesive  energies  (Ec)  of  the    Si1-xGexM  were 

calculated using the expression Ec = ET[SiGe] – ESi – EGe, where ET[SiGe] is the total energy of the 

optimized structure, and ESi and EGe are the energies of free Si and Ge atoms, respectively. All 

the energies of the  Si1-xGexM with different symmetries were obtained and shown in  Figure 1. 

All  the  energies  are  negative,  indicating  that  the    Si1-xGexM  are  energetically  favored. 

Additionally,  for  the  same  Ge  doping  concentration  the  energy  variations  of  the    Si1-xGexM 

between different symmetries are small.  

FIG. 1. Cohesive energy Ec of the  Si1-xGexM as the function of doping symmetries. The inset in 

the right down corner shows the 2×2×1 supercell of silicene. 

The structural stabilities of the  Si1-xGexM with different symmetries were then explored using 

phonon  dispersions.  For  comparison,  we  also  calculated  the  phonon  spectra  of  silicene  and 

germanene  (not  shown),  and  the  results  were  consistent  with  previous  theoretical  work.5,42-44 

6 

 
 
Typical phonon spectra of Si0.25Ge0.75M, Si0.5Ge0.5M and Si0.25Ge0.75M along the high symmetric 

points in the Brillouin zone are shown in Figure 2a-f. For all the 2D honeycomb structures, there 

are three acoustical branches: LA, TA and ZA. Because of the fast attenuation of transverse force, 

when k→0, the LA and TA branches which contribute a lot to heat conduction are linear, while 

the dispersion of ZA branches which contribute little to thermal conductivity is quadratic. Most 

importantly,  one  can  see  that  all  the  vibration  frequencies  calculated  are  positive  without 

imaginary part, especially the frequencies of acoustical modes (ZA, TA and LA) as k→0, which 

ensures  structural  stability.45 The  results indicate  that  the    Si1-xGexM  are  dynamically  stable  at 

ground  state  even  for  long-wavelength  lattice  vibrations  and  are  likely  to  be  synthesized 

experimentally.  The  interaction  between  Si  and  Ge  atoms  can  be  further  analyzed  by  electron 

localization function (ELF),46 as shown in  Figure 2g. Here, the ELF values vary from 0.53 for 

free  electrons  to  1  for  fully  localized  electrons,  and  the  values  between  0.7  and  0.8  indicate 

covalent bonding character. Obviously, there are charge accumulations between Si-Si, Si-Ge and 

Ge-Ge bonds, indicating strong covalent interactions.

local function (ELF) density diagrams of Si0.5Ge0.5M with P21/m symmetry and its Si-Si bond,

In short, our results reveal that the Si1-xGexM (0<x<1) with all the elementary proportions x 

studied  are  structurally  stable,  which  suggests  an  infinite  miscibility  between  the  Si  and  Ge 

atoms in the 2D honeycomb monolayers, just as those in 3D face-centered diamond-cubic SiGe 

crystals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 2D binary system which exhibits infinite 

8 

 
 
miscibility of two elements and could provide a lot of varieties and functionalities in structures 

and properties for 2D applications.

In order to explore the structural characteristics of the Si1-xGexM, the lattice parameters were 

then  calculated  and  shown  in  Table  1.  Here,  two  doping  strategies  were  considered:  lowest 

energy (LE) strategy and highest entropy (HS) strategy. The LE doping strategy corresponds to 

the  most  energetically  probable  situation  in  equilibrium  where  the  minimum  energy  principle 

rules,  while  the  HS  strategy  corresponds  to  the  situation  where  dopants  are  most  evenly 

distributed and the doped system has the highest entropy, which also occurs experimentally in 

the synthesis of alloys. In both situations, as the Ge concentrations increases, the 2D hexagonal 

lattice  constant  (a)  increases,  the  nearest-neighbor  distance  (d)  of  the  Si-Si  and  Ge-Ge  atoms 

9 

 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
increases,  the  bond  angle  (θ)  of  adjacent  bonds  decreases,  and  the  buckling  parameter  (△) 

increases, while the bond length of Si-Ge bond change a little (from 2.34 to 2.38Å). The larger 

bond  length  (2.28-2.44Å)  of  the  Si-Si  and  Ge-Ge  atoms  in  the  SiGeM  relative  to  that  of  C-C 

atoms in graphene (~1.42Å) prevents the formation of strong π bonds between atoms, leading to 

the  formation  of  buckling  structure  of the  SiGeM.  Consequently,  the  bucking  structure  further 

results in mixed sp2-sp3 hybridization. According to the Jahn-Teller theorem,47 the total energy of 

the structure is reduced and the structural stability is regained.48 

The simulated STM images of the Si1-xGexM with different doping strategies under 0.5V bias 

were shown in  Figure 3. The bright and dark dots represent the top and bottoms, respectively. 

The area surrounded by the blue rhombus represents the location of the primitive cell. Obvious 

honeycomb  structures  can  be  observed  from  STM  imaging.  For  the  LE  doping  strategy,  the 

brightness  of  the  atoms  in  Si0.875Ge0.125M  and  Si0.125Ge0.875M  is  basically  uniform,  while  the 

brightness  of  the  atoms  in  the  others  is  different,  indicating  that  Si0.875Ge0.125M  and 

Si0.125Ge0.875M are flatter than the other SiGeM. This was more intuitive from the side view at 

the  bottom  of  each  STM  diagram  where  the  atoms  with  the  highest  position  were  marked  by 

orange  triangles.  For  the  HS  doping  strategy,  the  situation  is  opposite:  except  for  those  in 

Si0.875Ge0.125M and Si0.125Ge0.875M, the brightness of the atoms in all the others is uniform. The 

results indicate that the  SiGeM in the HS doping case are generally smoother than those in the 

LE doping case. This may provide some guidance for future experimental characterizations.

Si0.125Ge0.875M with LE and HS doping strategies after smearing, respectively. The supercells in 

the STM images are highlighted with blue rhombus. Orange and blue arrows indicate relatively 

high and low positions in the same layer, and an orange triangle represents an atom at a higher 

relative position.  

Raman spectroscopy has been used in the analysis of characteristic vibrational modes of 2D 

materials. For instance, the calculated G-like and D peaks are likely to be fingerprints of Raman 

spectra  of  silicene  and  germanene,42  and  the  Raman  frequency  shift  has  been  applied  to  the 

quantitative analysis of MoS2 layers.49 In Table 2, we show typical calculated results of Raman 

11 

 
 
and infrared activities of the  Si1-xGexM. The results of silicene and germanene in the table are 

consistent  with  previous  work.  42  For  Si0.5Ge0.5M  with  P3m1  symmetry,  there  are  6  phonon 

modes divided into 3 acoustic and 3 optical modes. Brillouin zone-center optical phonon modes 

shows  following  irreducible  representation  characteristics:  Γoptic=A1+E,  where  A1  mode  comes 

from the vibrations of associated atoms along the out-of-plane direction, and E mode is doubly 

degenerated  and  indicates  lack  of  vibrations  along  the  out-of-plane  direction.  Both  A1  and  E 

modes are Raman and infrared active. For Si0.75Ge0.25M and Si0.25Ge0.75M with P-3m1 symmetry, 

there are 24 phonon modes divided into 3 acoustic and 21 optical modes. Brillouin zone-center 

optical  phonon  modes  show 

the 

following 

irreducible 

representation  characteristics: 

Γoptic=3A1g+4Eg+  2A2u+  3Eu+A1u+A2g,  where  A1g,  A2g,  A1u  and  A2u  modes  come  from  the 

vibrations of associated atoms along the out-of-plane direction, and Eg and Eu modes are doubly 

degenerated  and  come  from  the  vibrations  along  the  in-plane  direction.  A1g and  Eg  modes  are 

Raman  active,  and  A2u  and  Eu  modes  are  infrared  active.  It  is  found  that  the  energies  of  the 

optical  and  acoustic  phonon  curves  of  the  compounds  decrease  with  the  increase  of  the 

concentration of Ge atoms, because the strength of the interatomic bonds decreases as well.

Since  the  SiGeM  deviates  from  planar  geometry  and  the  buckling  degree  of  the  SiGeM 

increases  compared  to  that  of  graphene,  the  effective  spin-orbit  coupling  (SOC)  will  also 

increase, 6 implying that quantum spin hall effect (QSHE) of the SiGeM will be more significant. 

Additionally,  since  a  Ge  atom  has  larger  intrinsic  SOC  strength  than  a  Si  one  does,  the  naïve 

speculation  would  be  that  SOC  will  increase  as  the  Ge  concentration  increases. Therefore,  the 

band structures of the SiGeM with different Ge concentrations were calculated by PBE + SOC 

corrections.

HS and LE doping strategies, respectively. All of them are marked with red circle in  Figure 1. 

The Fermi level or valence band top is set as zero.  

Figure 4a gives a typical 3d band structure of Si1-xGexM (x = 0.25) without considering SOC, 

which shows two distinct Dirac cones formed at K and K' points. Due to the symmetry at K and 

K', the ambipolar character in the small energy range near the EF is very significant. Around the 

crossing  point,  these  bands  are  linear,  therefore  charge  carriers  behave  like  massless  Dirac 

fermions, which could be useful for electronic applications. Figure 4b-h give the band structures 

14 

 
 
of  Si0.875Ge0.125M,  Si0.75Ge0.25M,  Si0.625Ge0.375M,  Si0.5Ge0.5M,  Si0.375Ge0.625M,  Si0.25Ge0.75M  and 

Si0.125Ge0.875M with SOC in the LE and HS doping cases. For the convenience of comparison, we 

also calculated the band structures of silicene and germanene under SOC. The band gap widths 

of  silicene  (4meV)  and  germanene(23.6meV)  are  basically  the  same  as  those  in  previous 

work.6,50  Interestingly,  when  the  SOC  is  taken  into  account,  the  existence  of  low  buckling 

structure  can  open  an  obvious  gap  at  Dirac  point.  In  the  LE  doping  case,  Si0.75Ge0.25M, 

Si0.5Ge0.5M,  Si0.25Ge0.75M,  and  Si0.125Ge0.875M  show  direct  band  gaps  of  8.5meV,  10.5meV, 

17.8meV  and  12.2meV,  respectively.  In  the  HS  doping  case,  Si0.75Ge0.25M,  Si0.25Ge0.75M  and 

Si0.125Ge0.875M  show  direct  band  gaps  of  5.8meV,  16.1meV  and  12.2meV,  respectively. 

Therefore, SOC in the low-buckled structures can achieve non-trivial band topological properties 

in the SiGeM, indicating that QSHE could be realized in the materials. 

The diagrams of band gap values vs. Ge concentrations in the  Si1-xGexM with the LE and HS 

doping  strategies  were  shown  in  Figure  4.  In  both  strategies,  the  band  gap  values  change  in 

oscillatory  ways  as  Ge  concentration  x  changes.  Interestingly,  when  x  equals  to  0.5,  the  LE 

doping strategy results in a narrow band gap semiconductor, while the HS doping strategy results 

in a metal with zero band gap. The results probably result from the interplay between SOC and 

crystalline field splitting: as x changes, both the buckling degree (△) and space symmetry of the 

monolayer changes, and △ -dependent SOC and symmetry-dependent crystalline field splitting 

change, but in different ways, resulting in oscillatory variations of band gap values. In addition, 

since different symmetries in the LE and HS doped samples generate different crystalline fields 

and  influence  band  structures  differently,  different  variation  of  band  structures  are  obtained  in 

different doping strategies. Especially, two different electronic states (semiconductor and metal) 

are obtained at 50% doping concentration for LE and HS doping strategies, respectively.

FIG. 5. The band gap values of the  Si1-xGexM as the function of Ge concentration x with the LE 

and HS doping strategies, respectively.  

Based on the diagram in Figure 5, an alternative method of tuning the band gap values of the 

2D  materials  via  varying  doping  concentrations  and  doping  strategies  can  be  proposed.  This 

method is  different  from  previously  reported  methods  used in  other  2D  systems  such  as  stress 

modification,  element  adsorption  and  electric/magnetic  field  tuning,51-55 and  is  robust  since the 

elementary concentration x can vary from 0 to 100% and the band gaps can be well controlled in 

a  non-trivial  way.  As  a  result,  the  SiGeM  can  change  between  Dirac  metals  and  narrow-band 

semiconductors, depending on the doping concentrations and doping strategies. We note that it 

has  been  shown  very  recently  that  the  band  gaps  of  germanene  can  be  tuned  to  ~1.5  eV  by 

hydrogen functionalization.25 Combing engineering of doping concentrations and strategies and 

other  techniques  such  as  hydrogen  functionalization,  SiGeM  could  show  great  electronic  and 

optical tunability for design and application of 2D semiconducting materials.

Finally,  the  effective  masses  of  the  carriers  in  the  semiconducting  SiGeM  were  studied. 

Here, the equation of 1/m=(∂2E(k))/(ћ2∂k2)  is used to obtain the effective masses of the valence 

band  maximum  (VBM)  and  the  conduction  band  minimum  (CBM)  with  considering  the 

influence of SOC, where ћ is the reduced Planck constant. As shown in Table 3, the effective 

masses of the carriers are between 0.08m0 and 0.21m0 in either the LE or HS case, comparable to 

those  of  bilayer  graphene,  silicene  and  germanene.56,57  We  note  that  the  effective  masses  in 

silicene (mh= 0.021 m0, me = 0.021 m0) and germanene (mh= 0.009 m0, me = 0.008 m0) obtained 

in our work are consistent with previous theoretical work57 within the accuracy limits of DFT. 

The low effective masses of the carriers suggest the potentials of the SiGeM in the applications 

of fast and low energy cost electronic devices. 

CONCLUSIONS 

In summary, we have systematically investigated the stabilities and structural and electronic 

properties  of    Si1-xGexM  (0<x<1).  Our  results  reveal  a  structurally  stable  2D  binary  system  in 

which the two elements are infinitely miscible with each other. The structural characteristics was

electronic properties reveals oscillatory behaviors of band gap variations as x changes and low 

effective masses of carriers in the  Si1-xGexM. The  Si1-xGexM with stable structures and excellent 

properties  would  be  provide  varieties  in  structure  and  functionalities  and  be  important  for  2D 

applications of group IV semiconductors.
