Abstract 

 Ion-doped binary SiO2-CaO and ternary SiO2-CaO-P2O5 mesoporous bioactive glasses were 

synthesised and characterised to evaluate the influence of P2O5 in the glass network structure. 

Strontium,  copper  and  cobalt  oxides  in  a  proportion  of  0.8  mol%  were  selected  as  dopants 

because  the  osteogenic  and  angiogenic  properties  reported  for  these  elements.  Although  the 

four  glass  compositions  investigated  presented  analogous  textural  properties,  TEM  analysis 

revealed  that  the  structure  of  those  containing  P2O5  exhibited  an  increased  ordered 

mesoporosity.  Furthermore,  29Si  NMR  revealed that  the incorporation of  P2O5 increased the 

network connectivity and that this compound captured the Sr2+, Cu2+ and Co2+ ions preventing 

them to behave as modifiers of the silica network. In addition, 31P NMR results revealed that 

the nature of the cation directly influences the characteristics of the phosphate clusters. In this 

study,  we  have  proven  that  phosphorous  oxide  entraps  doping-metallic  ions,  granting  these 

glasses with a greater mesopores order.

Introduction 

Bioactive glasses (BGs) are known to have an outstanding capability to stimulate bone regeneration [1] 

by their bone-bonding abilities. Two processing methods are mainly used to prepare these glasses: the 

traditional  melt-quenching process  and  the sol-gel  technique.  One  of  the  main  advantages  of  sol-gel 

glasses is their high bioactive behavior due to the rapid dissolution of this material originated from their 

fine porous structure and the important quantity of silanol groups present in their surface, which could 

act as nucleation sites for the formation of an apatite layer when in contact with simulated body fluid 

(SBF)[2–4].  Furthermore,  in  2004[5]  a  new  generation  of  bioactive  glasses,  namely  mesoporous 

bioactive  glasses  (MBGs), was  introduced.  MBGs  are  characterized  by  presenting  tailored  (ordered) 

porosity  at  the  nanometer  scale,  which  is  created  by  combination  of  supramolecular  chemistry  of 

surfactants and sol-gel chemistry and opened new application fields to these materials, such as drug 

delivery.  Research  on  the  application  of  MBGs  in  tissue  engineering  and  drug  delivery  has  been 

accelerated in recent years as emphasized in recent reviews[6–8]. These materials, whose composition 

is  mostly  based  on  the  SiO2-CaO-P2O5  system,  have  a  highly  ordered  mesoporous  structure,  which 

induces an accelerated bioactive behavior and the capacity of confining drug molecules to be released 

in a controlled manner[6]. It has also been reported that the addition of phosphorous is not necessary to 

obtain silicate MBGs of high bioactivity [9]. However, P2O5 plays a significant role on the local structure 

of  the  MBGs  network.  In  this  sense,  it  has  been  reported  that  most  of  the  phosphorous  atoms  are 

incorporated  as  orthophosphates  within  the  silica  network,  thus  resulting  in  the  formation  of  small 

clusters with Ca2+ cations [10] that highly determines the bioactive behavior of these glasses. 

During the last decade, metallic ions such as boron, copper, lithium, gallium, silver, strontium, 

cerium, cobalt and zinc, among others, have emerged as potential therapeutic agents with the ability to 

enhance bone formation by their stimulating effects on osteogenesis and angiogenesis[11,12]. In recent 

studies, new compositions of mesoporous materials including the addition of therapeutic ions have been 

suggested  in  order  to  increase  the  materials’  functionality  and  biological  activity,  particularly  for 

applications in large-size bone defects, which are a significant clinical challenge[8]. A main property of 

some of the commonly used therapeutic ions such as boron, zinc, cerium and gallium, is that they are 

known to be osteogenic. Other functional properties such as angiogenesis and antibacterial activity can 

also be assigned to some therapeutic ions[8,11,12].  

Notably, copper, strontium and cobalt ions have attracted particular interest as they have been 

reported to confer  osteogenesis, angiogenesis and antibacterial properties to MBGs[8]. Cu2+ ions are 

known  to  stimulate  the  proliferation  of  endothelial  cells,  enhance  cell  activity  and  proliferation  of 

osteoblastic cells, improve micro-vessel formation as well as to promote wound healing and to have 

antibacterial  effects[8,12,13].  Furthermore,  copper  ions  are  not  affected  during  scaffolds  processing 

which involves high temperatures[14]. Sr2+ ions have shown to be able to enhance bone cell activities 

by promoting osteoblast activity and inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, as well as maintain excellent 

acellular bioactivity of the glasses[8,12]. Furthermore, it has been observed that the release of Sr2+ ions 

also stimulates significantly ALP activity[8,12]. Nevertheless, doping amount within the glass must be 

carefully controlled as a high content of Sr will influence the glass network formation and decrease the 

degree  of  order  of  the  mesoporous  structure[8].  Co2+  ions  are  described  in  the  literature  as  having 

angiogenic  capacity  determined  by  inducing  a  hypoxic  cascade  (including  HIF-1α  stabilization  and 

VEGF secretion from hBMSCs)[10,15]. Generally, Co2+ ions are added to the composition in order to 

develop  hypoxia-mimicking  (low  oxygen  pressure  environment)  materials[8,12,15,  16].  It  has  been 

reported that by mimicking hypoxic condition, Co2+ ions could induce the coupling of osteogenesis and 

angiogenesis[15].  Nonetheless,  it  has  also  been  reported  that  Co2+  ions  lead  easier  to  potential 

cytotoxicity compared to Cu2+ ions[8], an important aspect to be considered when doping the material 

with this ion. However, the role that even small amounts of these dopants can play on the mesoporous 

structure of MBG remains unclear.  

In the present study, we attempt to demonstrate that the presence of phosphorous oxide in the 

composition allows capturing selected ionic dopants in the network, namely Sr and Co, thus conferring 

the material porosity of greater order. The incorporation of SrO and CuO in MBGs in an independent 

way  has  been  previously  reported  in  literature  [8].  In  the  present  investigation,  both  dopants  were 

incorporated with the aim of achieving a synergy role of both compounds for future biological assays. 

Results  of  structural  characterization  to  elucidate  the  influence  of  the  ion  content  on  the  developed 

MBGs are presented. Based on previous work performed on ion-doped glasses[17–20], the range of 

substituent’s concentration was chosen so that  they did not inhibit or decrease the bioactivity of the 

MBGs. Moreover, the amounts of the leached ions (Cu2+, Sr2+, Co2+) were chosen to be below the toxic 

level in blood plasma[8,11,12,20].  

2.  Materials and methods 

2.1 Preparation of ion-doped mesoporous glasses 

Ion-doped mesoporous glasses in the systems 78SiO2 20CaO 1.2P2O5 0.8Xion oxide and 79.2SiO2 20CaO 

0.8Xion  oxide (in mol%) were  synthesized, keeping the total amount of ion constant.  The glasses were 

doped on the one hand with a mixture of strontium and copper ions, on the other hand with cobalt ions. 

The MBGs were prepared by the evaporation-induced self-assembly method (EISA)[20,21] and using 

Pluronic® F127 as structure-directing agent. Pluronic® F127 was dissolved overnight in 85 mL EtOH 

with 1.2 mL HNO3 (0.5N). Reactants were then added under continuous stirring in the following order: 

tetraethyl  orthosilicate  (TEOS),  in  the  case  of  the  phosphorous  containing  compositions  triethyl 

phosphate  (TEP),  calcium  nitrate  Ca(NO3)2.4H2O  and  strontium  nitrate  Sr(NO3)2  or  copper  nitrate 

Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O or cobalt nitrate Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), with a 3 hours interval 

between each addition. The reaction was left under constant stirring at room temperature (RT) for 24 

hours,  and  was then  poured  into  petri-dishes  (15  mL/petri-dish) for  EISA  during  5  to  7  days  before 

proceeding  with  the  heat treatment.  The  dried  gels  were  calcinated  at  700°C  for  3  hours.  The  exact 

amounts of reactants are mentioned in Table 1.

2.2 Characterization of the ion-doped MBGs 

Powder  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  analysis  was  performed  using  a  D8  ADVANCE  diffractometer 

(Bruker, Madison, US) in a 2θ range from 20 -80°. BG powders were dispersed in ethanol. Then, the 

solution was dripped on off-axis cut, low background silicon wafers (Bruker AXS, Germany). For the 

small  angle  measurements  Philips  X’Pert  diffractometer  equipped  with  Cu K radiation  (wavelength 

1.5418 Å) was used. XRD patterns were collected in the 2θ° range between 0.5 θ° and 6.5 θ°, with a 

step size of 0.02 θ° and counting time of 4s per step. 

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs of samples were recorded with an Auriga 

SEM Instrument (Zeiss, Germany). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Oxford Instruments) was 

performed to obtain a qualitative appreciation of the ions in the composition. 

For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, samples were dispersed with ethanol on 

a  lacey  carbon  film.  In  order  to  observe  the  mesoporous  structure  of  the  materials  a  JEOL-3010 

transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV was used. Images were 

obtained using a CCD camera (model Keen view, SIS analyses size 1024 x 1024, pixel size 23.5 mm x 

23.5 mm) at 30 000x and 60 000x magnification using a low-dose condition. Fourier transform (FT) 

patterns were conducted using a digital micrograph (Gatan). 

Nitrogen physisorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using Micrometrics ASAP 2010 and 

ASAP 2020 porosimetry instruments. Prior to the measurements the samples were outgassed at least for 

12 h at 120 – 150°C under vacuum. Pore size distribution curves were calculated from the adsorption 

branch  of  the  isotherm  according  to  the  Barrett,  Joyner  and  Halenda  (BJH)  method  to  determine 

mesoporous size distribution. The total pore volume was calculated from the adsorption point at 0.98 

P/P0. Specific surface areas were obtained from the BET equation in the linear range between 0.07 and 

0.23 P/P0. 

1H→29Si  and  1H→31P  CP  (cross-polarization)/MAS  (magic-angle-spinning)  and  single-pulse 

(SP)  solid-state  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  measurements  were  performed  to  evaluate  the 

different  silicon  and  phosphorus  environments  in  the  synthesized  samples.  The  NMR  spectra  were 

recorded on a Bruker Model Avance 400 spectrometer. Samples were spun at 10 kHz for 29Si and 6 kHz 

in  the  case  of  31P.  Spectrometer  frequencies  were  set  to  79.49  and  161.97  MHz  for  29Si  and  31P, 

 
 
respectively. Chemical shift values were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) and H3PO4 for 29Si and 

31P, respectively. All spectra were obtained using a proton enhanced CP method, using a contact time of 

1 ms. The time period between successive accumulations was 5 and 4 s for  29Si and 31P, respectively, 

and the number of scans was 10 000 for all spectra.  

3.  Results and discussion 

The  developed  samples  SrCu/P2O5  and  Co/P2O5  were  heat  treated  at  700°C.  In  order  to  confirm  the 

amorphous state of the samples, XRD analyses were conducted. Results are shown in Figure 1.   

Figure 1. High angle XRD spectra of samples SrCu/P2O5 and Co/P2O5. 

No diffraction peaks are observed from the XRD spectra (Figure 1) of samples SrCu/P2O5 and Co/P2O5 

indicating  the  amorphous  state.  A  broad  reflection  in  the  range  between  2θ=  20  and  35  °  is  clearly 

noticed for both samples suggesting that no crystalline phase is developed within the sample. Similar 

curves were obtained for SrCu/noP2O5 and Co/noP2O5 samples (not shown). 

The prepared samples were doped with strontium and copper ions for samples SrCu/P2O5 and 

SrCu/no P2O5 and cobalt ions for samples Co/P2O5 and Co/noP2O5. Figure 2 displays the general aspect 

of the two different ion-doped systems. The particular colors of the samples come directly from copper 

for samples SrCu/P2O5 and SrCu/no and cobalt for samples Co/P2O5 and Co/noP2O5.   

 
Figure 2. Image showing optical characteristics of samples doped with SrCu ions (on the left) and with 

Co ions. 

A first appreciation of the homogeneity of the doped glasses was revealed by EDX analysis, as shown 

in Figure 3. 

Figure 3. Images showing SEM and EDX mapping analysis (Sr, Cu and Co elements) for sample 

SrCu/P2O5 (left side) and sample Co/P2O5 (right side). 

From images of Figure 3, it is observed that ions are well dispersed on the surface of the prepared 

materials. We have to take into consideration that EDS analysis is purely qualitative, thus the intensity 

of the elements coloured in the mapping images is not a quantitative representation of the doped-element 

amounts. Samples SrCu/noP2O5 and Co/noP2O5 showed similar results.

(right side)  measured in the small angle range (2θ: 0.5 to 8). 

Figure  4  shows  the  SAXRD  spectra  of  the  four  samples,  namely  SrCu/P2O5,  SrCu/noP2O5, 

Co/P2O5  and  Co/noP2O5.  The  four  patterns  exhibit  a  unique  peak  at  around  2θ  =  1.20°,  typical  for 

mesoporous materials, which could be attributed to the (1 0) maxima of a 2D-hexagonal p6m phase 

[4,17,22–24].  However, the  information  derived  from  these XRD  patterns  is  not  enough  to  assign  a 

specific ordered phase for each sample and further evidences, as those provided by TEM, are required.  

Figure 5  TEM images showing the mesoporous structure of a) sample SrCu/P2O5, b) sample Co/P2O5, 

c) sample SrCu/noP2O5 and d) sample Co/noP2O5. 

 
 
 
Figure 5 revealed results obtained by TEM studies. After carrying out the observations of at 

least 6 crystals of each sample, it was concluded that a clear ordered 2D-hexagonal mesoporous structure 

is observed for all P2O5 containing samples. The images shown in figure 5 are only the representative 

ones  of  a  much  wider  study.  Visibly,  sample  Co/P2O5  appears  to  have  a  lightly  higher  ordered 

mesoporosity  than  sample  SrCu/P2O5,  which  is  likely  due  to  the  double  element  doping  for  sample 

SrCu/P2O5 that tends to decrease the order in the structure. For samples prepared without TEP addition 

during the synthesis, a clear decrease in the order of the structure is observed. Samples SrCu/noP2O5 

and  Co/noP2O5  exhibit  porosity  in  the  mesosize,  but  the  order  is  only  kept  in  small-range  regions, 

whereas most of the material exhibits a very defective structure, which is difficult to assign to a specific 

space group.  

N2  physical  sorption  analysis  were  performed  in  order  to  determine  pore-related  parameters, 

such as surface properties, specific surface area, pore size distribution and pore volume.  

Figure  6.    Nitrogen  adsorption  isotherms  of  the  synthesized  samples  and  pore  size  distribution 

calculated from the adsorption isotherms (insets). 

 
 
Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of the four samples are shown in Figure 6. Table 2 lists the data 

of  the  surface  area,  pore  volume  and  pore  size  of  samples  SrCu/P2O5,  SrCu/noP2O5,  Co/P2O5  and 

Co/noP2O5.The data presented for the four prepared samples is typical of mesoporous structures. The 

isotherm obtained for all samples, SrCu/P2O5, Co/P2O5,SrCu/noP2O5 and Co/noP2O5, are identified as 

type IV, which is the general case for mesoporous materials presented in the literature[19]. The sharp 

curve in the capillary condensation region is an indicator of narrow pore-size distribution. It has been 

reported[25] that hysteresis loops are included in isotherms obtained from those mesoporous materials 

with pore sizes large enough to allow the N2 condensation within them. Hysteresis loop shown to differ 

among samples. In the case of SrCu/noP2O5 sample the loop exhibits slope changes in both adsorption 

and  desorption  branches,  indicating  a  defective  mesoporous  structure.  When  P2O5  is  incorporated 

(sample SrCu/P2O5), the loop can be identified as type H2, corresponding to ink-bottle pores[4,23], that 

is, pores  narrow along their morphology that could be a consequence of the formation of phosphate 

based clusters with the different cations incorporated. Besides, the sharp slopes in both branches seem 

to indicate a higher ordering after P2O5 incorporation, in agreement with the results observed by TEM. 

The isotherms obtained for Co/P2O5 and Co/noP2O5 samples exhibit a similar situation, although in this 

case  the  loop  of  Co/noP2O5  seems  to  be  less  defective  in  comparison  with  SrCu/nOP2O5.  Pore  size 

distribution curves were calculated from the adsorption branch using the BJH model, which is also suited 

for this kind of mesoporous material. Samples SrCu/P2O5 and Co/P2O5 present a single-modal pore size 

distribution of. The narrow size distribution is centered at 3 nm for sample SrCu/P2O5 and at 3.6 nm for 

sample Co/P2O5. The BET surface areas of samples SrCu/P2O5 and Co/P2O5 reached 254 and 346 m2/g 

respectively and the total pore volumes calculated at P/P0 = 0.99 were 0.233 cm3/g for sample SrCu/P2O5 

and  0.379  cm3/g  for  sample  Co/P2O5.  These  results  are  in  accordance  with  the  literature,  where 

mesoporous glasses are reported to exhibit SBET in the range of 200 - 500 m2/g depending on the silica 

content[7].  Samples  prepared  without  the  addition  of  TEP  during  the  synthesis  do  not  show  any 

difference  in  structural  characteristics,  thus  this  stage  it  is  not  possible  to  evaluate  the  advantage  of 

adding phosphorous oxide.  Besides, the pore size distribution for samples without P2O5 seems to be 

wider and centered in larger pore diameter, indicating a pore size heterogeneity associated with defective 

mesoporous  structures.  The  role  of  P2O5  has  been  widely  studied  in  MBGs  by  HRTEM  and  NMR. 

Studies have shown that this oxide induces the formation of orthophosphate nanoclusters, which can 

produce changes in the local environment of MBGs. These changes could be responsible for the apparent 

anomalies found in the pore size distribution.

In    our  study,  TEM  and porosimetry  studies  indicate  that the incorporation  of P2O5  tends to 

increase  ordered  mesoporosity  (samples  SrCu/P2O5  and  Co/P2O5  compared  to  SrCu/noP2O5  and 

Co/noP2O5 without addition of TEP). It is suggested that the addition of this component in the doped-

glass allows incorporating more efficiently the cations within the network by cluster formation. In order 

to corroborate this hypothesis solid state NMR analysis was carried out to investigate the details of the 

network structure.

deconvolutions (green).

deconvolutions (green). 

29Si NMR spectroscopy was used to evaluate the network connectivity of MBGs as a function 

of the presence or absence of phosphorous in the chemical composition. Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 represent the 

silicon atoms (denoted Si*) in (NBO)3Si*-(OSi)1 (NBO)2Si*-(OSi)2, (NBO)Si*-(OSi)3, and Si*(OSi)4 

(NBO = non-bonding oxygen), respectively. The signals in the region of -109 ppm to -112 ppm are from 

Q4, those in the region -100 ppm to -102 ppm are from Q3. The Q2 signal appears approximately at -93 

ppm to -85 ppm. Q2 signals can be divided into two different signals associated with different types of 

silicon, related to with hydrogen and associated with network modifiers. On the one hand, Q2

H signals 

appear at -91 to -93 ppm and Q2

x is associated with signals between -82 to -85 ppm. Finally, signals at 

lower shifts (~76 ppm) are assigned to Q1 units. [10, 27]  

Figure 7 and Figure 8 show Single Pulse  29Si (left) and Cross Polarization (right) spectra for 

SrCu and Co doped samples, respectively. Single pulse spectra show higher contribution of Q4 compared 

to 1H CP spectra, as could be expected from the lower connectivity of silica tetrahedron in those regions 

enriched in protons, i.e. the glass surface. On the contrary, the silica units located at the surface exhibit 

higher amounts of Q3 units that would correspond with the presence of Si-OH groups. Table 3 shows 

 
the chemical shifts, deconvoluted peak areas, and silica network connectivity of the four samples studied 

in this  work.  By  comparing  samples  with  and  without  P2O5,  it is clear  that  the incorporation  of this 

compound  leads  to  an  increase  of  network  connectivity.  This  fact  evidences  that  P2O5  entraps  the 

divalent cations and removes them from the silica network. 

Table  3  Chemical  shifts,  relative  peak  areas,  and  silica  connectivity  obtained  by  Solid-state 

single pulse 29Si MAS NMR 

31P-NMR results were used to evaluate the local environment of P atoms, thus elucidating the 

phosphate species contained in the different samples (Figure 9). The spectra recorded by single pulse 

show one signal at ~2 ppm assignable to q0 units present in the PO4

3− species. The signals for Co/P2O5 

show full width at half-maximum height (FWHM) of around 12 ppm, which is typical of an amorphous 

orthophosphate[28]. On the contrary, the FWHM for SrCu/P2O5 sample is much narrow indicating that 

the clusters are larger and more crystalline in this sample. These results evidence that most of the P 

atoms  are  included  as  independent  PO4

3-  tetrahedra  within  the  silica  network,  thus  avoiding 

polyphosphate formation. The orthophosphates would be balanced with the divalent cations introduced 

in the system and the nature of the cations (Sr2+, Cu2+ or Co2+) seems to play an important role on the 

characteristics of the phosphate clusters. 

It has been reported in the literature[8] that MBGs are efficient systems for the simultaneous 

delivery  of  drugs  and  therapeutic  ions.  These  delivery  properties  confer  multifunctional  features  to 

mesoporous glasses which may enhance considerably the regeneration of large-bone defects. Although 

the beneficial effects of these cations have been widely reported, our results point out to an important 

drawback associated to their incorporation, i.e. the mesoporous structure is significantly affected even 

with small amounts of these dopants. This effect could be related with the high polarization effects of 

Co2+  and  Cu2+,  or  with  the  large  size  of  Sr2+  cations.  In  previous  studies[25],  the  capability  of 

phosphorous oxide entrapping divalent cations such as Ca2+ has been demonstrated. The consequence is 

that cations are removed from the silica network, thus suppressing their role as network modifiers and 

leading to higher silica network connectivity.

4.  Conclusions 

Mesoporous bioactive glasses doped with Sr2+/Cu2+ or Co2+ have been synthesized. In order to evaluate 

the  role  of  P2O5  in  the  mesoporous  structure,  two  series  with  and  without  P2O5 were  prepared.  The 

incorporation of a small amount (0.8 mol%) of Sr2+/Cu2+ or Co2+ ions was shown to lead to defective 

mesoporous structures, as evidenced by TEM. However, when 1.2 mol% of P2O5 is present, the MBGs 

exhibited  a  highly  ordered  mesoporous  structure.  This  fact  is  due  to  the  capability  of  P2O5  to  form 

clusters with divalent cations, thus avoiding these dopants to interfere during the mesophase formation. 

The findings of this work indicate an effective way to keep the high mesoporous structure of MBGs, 

even  when  cations  such  as  Sr2+/Cu2+  or  Co2+  are  incorporated  during  the  synthesis  to  produce 

multifunctional MBGs.
