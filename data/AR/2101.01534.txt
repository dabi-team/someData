Introduction

Gas-avalanche detectors, introduced originally for the needs of particle-physics experiments, have
become a prominent subject of research also in a variety of other ﬁelds [1]. To this extent, signiﬁcant
eﬀorts have been dedicated to the development of single-electron [2, 3] and single-photoelectron
UV-photon gaseous detectors; the latter, mainly in the context of Ring Imaging Cherenkov Counters
(RICH) [4, 5], with gaseous and solid photocathodes. Such gaseous photomultipliers (GPM) [6, 7]
provide a cost-eﬀective solution suitable for the coverage of large areas with good spatial and
temporal resolution, and low sensitivity to magnetic ﬁelds. GPM detectors have been developed
also for imaging scintillation and electroluminescence photons in noble gases [8] and liquids [9].

In this context, Gaseous Photodetectors [6] employing Multiwire [10] and Drift [11] Cham-
bers, Multi-step avalanche chambers [12], cascaded GEMs [13–15] and THGEM-based [16–19]
detectors have been playing an important role in experiments. As demonstrated in [20], the more
recent “hybrid” CsI-coated THGEM-Micromegas has shown to be an eﬃcient upgrade for the
COMPASS-RICH-I. Furthermore, THGEM-based detectors were demonstrated to have moderate
(sub-millimeter) localization resolution [21] and about 10 nsec time resolution, which comply with
the requirements of most RICH devices. Though, previous studies with THGEM detectors have
shown high gas gains for single-photoelectron detection [17], the latter could be considerably lower
in the presence of intense particle background [22].

In some applications, highly ionizing background environment can result in the formation of
large avalanches, often leading to electric discharge. The latter can damage the readout electronics

and the detector’s electrodes; it often introduces signiﬁcant dead-time. The thick Resistive WELL
(RWELL) [22] and the Resistive Plate WELL (RPWELL) detectors [23] were introduced to prevent
occasional discharges and mitigate their potential destructive eﬀects. In the RPWELL (Fig. 1(a)),
the single-sided CsI-coated THGEM electrode is coupled to a readout anode through a thin plate
of high bulk resistivity (109–1012 Ωcm). Ionization electrons induced by X-rays or UV-induced
photoelectrons from a photocathode deposited on the top surface (e.g. CsI) are collected into
the WELL holes where they undergo avalanche multiplication. Signals are induced capacitively
through the resistive plate onto a patterned readout anode, in direct contact with the resistive plate.
The RPWELL and its properties have been studied extensively in the laboratory and with particle
beams [24–26]. The studies demonstrated a high particle detection eﬃciency, over a broad dynamic
range and at high particle-ﬂux range, in a discharge-free operation mode at charge gains up to ∼104.
Compared to single-stage conﬁgurations, higher maximal achievable gains and lower discharge
probabilities can be achieved in a multi-stage one. In the present work, a double-sided THGEM
followed by a RPWELL was investigated (Fig. 1(b)). This leads to higher detector gains at lower
voltage bias per single THGEM and RPWELL element and thus to higher operation stability.

The single-photon detection eﬃciency (PDE) of a gaseous photon detector with a photocathode

followed by an ampliﬁcation element is provided by:

𝜖eﬀ (𝜆) = QE(𝜆)𝜖extr𝜖coll𝜖thresh

(1.1)

Here, 𝑄𝐸 (𝜆) is the wavelength-dependent quantum eﬃciency value in vacuum of the photo-
cathode. 𝜖𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑟 is the photoelectron extraction eﬃciency into the gas [27, 28], 𝜖𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙 is the eﬃciency to
transfer the extracted photoelectron into the ampliﬁcation region [17]. 𝜖𝑡 ℎ𝑟 𝑒𝑠ℎ is the single-electron
detection eﬃciency - the probability that the collected photoelectron will generate a signal above
a given threshold. 𝜖𝑡 ℎ𝑟 𝑒𝑠ℎ is strongly related to the shape of the electron charge spectrum which
reﬂects the physical processes governing the formation and development of the single-electron
avalanche.

In the present study, we investigated the UV-induced single-photoelectron charge spectra
generated in Ne/CH4 and Ar/CH4 gas mixtures with CsI-coated single RPWELL and double-stage
CsI-coated THGEM followed by an RPWELL. In section 2 we elaborate on the theory associated
with the formation of single-electron charge spectra. The experimental setup is detailed in section
3, followed by the introduction of the numerical analysis framework in section 4. The results are
presented in section 5 and discussed in section 6.

2 Single-electron charge spectra in gas-avalanche detectors - theoretical aspects

Electron avalanches in gas develop stochastically; the mean-free-path between successive interac-
tions and, accordingly, the electron energy available, can vary considerably between successive
interactions. This is dictated by the cross sections of the diﬀerent electron interactions with gas
molecules (elastic and inelastic). As a result, the avalanche size (e.g. detector charge gain) ﬂuctu-
ations determine the shape of single-photoelectron charge spectra (see detailed study by Alkhazov
[29]). Thus, these statistical ﬂuctuations set a physical limit on the single-photoelectron detec-
tion eﬃciency and localization resolution. Furthermore, large avalanche ﬂuctuations increase the
probability for high-charge events, with a potential for occasional discharges.

The shape of the single-electron charge distribution depends on the gas mixture, the reduced
electric ﬁeld (E/p; p being the gas pressure and E the electric ﬁeld), the electron initial momentum
and the distance over which the avalanche develops. Gain ﬂuctuations can be described quantita-
tively in terms of the probability Pn(r0, p0) that an electron with initial momentum p0 released at a
position r0 initiates an avalanche resulting in n electrons in the detector.

According to [30, 31], under a moderate uniform ﬁeld, an estimate of the single-electron
avalanche distribution can be carried out with the assumption that the probability of ionization by
an electron depends only on the electric ﬁeld strength and is independent of its previous history.
Yule-Furry statistics states that the probability P(n, x) of a single primary electron to produce an
avalanche with n electrons, while propagating from the origin to a point x, follows an exponential
law:

P(n, x) (cid:39)

1
¯n(x)

−n
¯n(x)

e

(2.1)

– 3 –

Here, ¯n is the mean number of avalanche electrons. We deﬁne f to be the relative variance of
the mean value. For an exponential distribution, f ∼ 1 and the photon detection eﬃciency falls
exponentially with increasing threshold.

At higher ﬁeld values, the avalanche size distribution was found to depart from the monoton-
ically falling exponential; it exhibits a rounded peak. The probability of ionization by an electron
can no longer be considered totally independent of its history [30, 31]. The assumption that all the
electrons take part in the multiplication process with equal probability must be abandoned. The
ionization mean-free-path becomes comparable to that for excitation and other inelastic processes.
The charge distribution under these circumstances, introduced by Byrne, is known as Polya distri-
bution [32, 33]. Its derivation assumes that the ionization probability per unit path-length depends
on the current size of the avalanche through a dimensionless parameter 𝜃. The probability of a
single primary electron to produce an avalanche with n electrons, while propagating from the origin
to a point x, follows a “peaked” Polya distribution [30–32]:

P(n, x) =

(cid:20) (1 + 𝜃)n
¯n(x)

(cid:21) 𝜃

(cid:104) −(1+𝜃 )n
¯n(x)

(cid:105)

e

(2.2)

Relative to an exponential decay, detectors providing single-photoelectron Polya-like spectra
are expected to have superior detection eﬃciency for a given electronics threshold. For each detector
conﬁguration, the relative variance f and most probable avalanche size nmp are given by [34, 35]:

and

f =

1
1 + 𝜃

(2.3)

(2.4)
respectively. Thus, the larger the 𝜃-value, the smaller the variance and the closer the most probable
charge value is to the mean. Namely, for a given charge gain and electronics threshold the larger
the 𝜃-value the better the single-electron detection eﬃciency is expected to be.

nmp =

¯n𝜃
1 + 𝜃

The eﬀect of inelastic and ionizing collision on the avalanche size distribution can be understood
in terms of a simple model discussed in [32]. During the electron drift, after each interaction, it either
ionizes or loses its kinetic energy by other, non-ionizing inelastic collisions. At electron energies
close to the ionization threshold, the cross-section for ionization is still signiﬁcantly smaller than
the sum of the inelastic cross-sections (including excitations). With increasing energy, ionization
gradually becomes the dominant process; thus, with increasing the E/p - the relative frequency
of ionizing collisions is enhanced. The shape of the distribution in this case is determined by the
ionization yield Y which is deﬁned as:

Y =

Nion
Nion + Ninel + Nexc

(2.5)

Here, Nion, Nexc and Ninel are the number of ionizations, excitation, and other inelastic collisions,
respectively.

The relative variance f is, then, related to Y by:

f ≈

1 − Y
1 + Y

3 Experimental setup

In the present work, a single and a double-stage RPWELL-based detector have been investigated.
The setup consisted of UV- and X-ray sources, a vessel containing the detector elements and a
readout system. The detector vessel was equipped with two windows - a 50 𝜇m thick Kapton one
for the X-rays and a quartz one for the UV photons.

Two radiation sources were used: a self-triggered homemade H2 discharge lamp emitting
∼160 nm UV photons and a 55Fe source emitting 5.9 keV X-ray photons. The H2-lamp pulse rate
was controlled by the voltage supplied to the lamp (here, 3.7 kV), by a, HK model 6900 Dual
MWPC power supply. To ensure counting only single-photon events, the UV-ﬂux was attenuated
with VUV natural ﬁlters (Oriel) and a 1 mm diameter collimator. The attenuation was set to detect
one single UV-photon signal by the detector for every 10 trigger signals - resulting in the current
setup in single-photon event rate of ∼1 Hz/mm2.

The detector vessel was ﬂushed with either Ne/CH4 (2%, 5%, 10% and 15% CH4) or with
Ar/5%CH4 to study the eﬀect of gas mixtures and the quencher concentration on the single-electron
spectrum.

Details of the two, 30 × 30 mm2 FR4-made detector conﬁgurations are depicted in Fig. 1.
The single-stage detector is a 0.8 mm thick RPWELL, coated with CsI photocathode (∼ 300 nm
thick) on its top THGEM-electrode surface; it is preceded by a 5 mm drift gap and a drift cathode.
The double-stage detector has a CsI-coated 0.4 mm thick double-sided THGEM pre-ampliﬁcation
element, separated by a 2 mm transfer gap from the 0.4 mm thick RPWELL multiplication stage.
The latter has a single-sided Cu clad at the top (single Cu-THGEM). All THGEM electrodes had
hexagonal hole layout, hole diameter 0.5 mm, hole spacing 0.96 mm and hole-rim 0.1 mm. In both
conﬁgurations, the RPWELL structure was formed by coupling the THGEM bottom to a 0.4 mm
thick Semitron ESD225 [36] resistive plate (bulk resistivity of 109 Ωcm). The resistive plate was
coupled to a Cu-coated readout anode using 3MTM Electrically Conductive Adhesive Transfer Tape
9707.

The transfer electric ﬁeld, 𝐸𝑇 𝑟 𝑎𝑛𝑠 𝑓 𝑒𝑟 , value in the double-structure, was set to of 0.5 kV/cm;
that of the drift ﬁeld 𝐸𝐷𝑟 𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 , was set to 0.5 kV/cm, to collect the ionization electrons induced by
X-rays; for an eﬃcient detection of UV-photons, 𝐸𝐷𝑟 𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 value was set to zero [37]. The electrodes
were polarized through low-pass ﬁlters (LPF), by CAEN N1471H HV power supplies.
In all
conﬁgurations, the anode was kept at ground potential and the signals were recorded through a
charge-sensitive pre-ampliﬁer (CAEN A1422). They were further processed through an Ortec 572
A linear ampliﬁer with 2 𝜇sec shaping time. The acquisition was performed either by a Tektronix
MSO 5204B Mixed Signal Oscilloscope or by a multi-channel analyzer (MCA Amptek 8000A).

In the current study, the measured vacuum QE-value of the CsI photocathode was ∼15% at
160 nm; no eﬀorts were made to enhance its value. Its assembly in the detector vessel was performed
under controlled N2 atmosphere.

4 Experimental methodology and numerical analysis

Taking into account potential charging-up eﬀects [38], some gain-stabilization was necessary prior
to the measurements. Therefore, single-photoelectron charge spectra were measured according to

– 5 –

the following protocol:

• Switching “oﬀ” the source and voltages;

• Flushing the detector with the selected gas mixture at 50 SCCM for 2 hours;

• Switching “on” the voltages and the source(s) and waiting for 30 minutes for the gain stabi-

lization;

• Data collection for 30 minutes;

• Switching oﬀ the source and measuring the noise for 30 minutes;

The signal spectra were obtained by subtracting the measured noise spectra from the measured

data. In our experimental conﬁguration, the electronic noise was ∼104 electrons.

Each experimental spectrum was ﬁtted to a generic Polya distribution (eqn. 2.2). The mean
gain value was extracted with its corresponding value for the Polya parameter 𝜃. Experimentally,
for each detector conﬁguration, the relative single-electron detection eﬃciency was estimated (for
a given electronic threshold) as dividing the number of counts at a given voltage for a particular
conﬁguration by the number of counts at the maximal voltage for the same conﬁguration - normalized
to the number of lamp triggers, 150,000 per experiment. The statistical error in all the measurements
is at the level of 1%. The error bars are too small to be seen in the plots presented below.

In addition, a set of Monte Carlo simulations was carried out using the same analytical function
(eqn. 2.2) with experimentally obtained detector gain and 𝜃 values as input parameters. For 10,000
events, a histogram was ﬁlled, representing the expected single-electron spectrum for given gain
and 𝜃 values. The absolute single-electron detection eﬃciency was estimated by counting events
with total number of electrons above a given threshold.

It should be worth mentioning here that the reported detector gain values presented in this study
could vary due to charging-up eﬀects in presence of X-rays [37]. By comparing the single-electron
spectra before and after X-ray irradiation (∼30 Hz/mm2) it was observed that the gain is reduced by
a factor of ∼1.4 whereas, the 𝜃 parameter varied by a factor ∼1.2. A detailed study on the charging
up eﬀects is beyond the scope of the present work; it will be discussed elsewhere.

5 Results

Polya-like distributions were recorded with single photoelectrons, in the single and double-stage
RPWELL-based detectors (shown on Fig. 1), with diﬀerent gas mixtures and voltage conﬁgurations.
The eﬀects of the latter on the Polya parameters 𝜃 and f and on the single-electron detection eﬃciency
are discussed.

5.1 Single- and double-stage RPWELL-based detectors

UV-induced single-electron spectra were measured with the double-stage and single-stage RPWELL
in Ne/5%CH4 at diﬀerent voltage settings. The charge spectra, at a gain of ∼1.4 × 105, are shown in
Fig. 2(a). In the double-stage structure, the voltage diﬀerence across the THGEM (Δ𝑉𝑇 𝐻 𝐺𝐸 𝑀 ) was
kept constant at 700 V; it was set to maximize the extraction eﬃciency of the photoelectrons and

their collection into the holes [38]. The RPWELL voltage (Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿), in the double-stage, was set
to 575 V to get similar total-gain value to that of the single-stage detector (at Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿 = 950 V).
The gain variation with Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿 is shown in Fig. 2(b) for the two detector conﬁgurations.
Each spectrum was ﬁtted with eqn. 2.2 to yield the values of the gain and 𝜃. The double-stage
RPWELL reached a maximal gain with UV-photons of ∼2.1 × 106 (∼4 × 105 with X-rays); in the
single-stage detector the gain was limited to ∼2.5 × 105 - both under stable discharge-free operation
conditions.

As expected, the 𝜃-value increases with the gain (Fig. 2(c)). The relation between 𝜃 and the
gain, measured with the two detectors, exhibits the same linear trend. The comparison with the
double-stage detector shows that the 𝜃 value is lower than that of the single-stage RPWELL, for
equal gain. It is due to the charge development and “saturation” in a single hole. However, as the
double-stage detector reaches higher gain values, the maximum achievable 𝜃 parameter is higher,
reaching values ∼0.6.

The relative gain variance “f ” is plotted as a function of the gain in Fig. 2(d). As discussed

– 7 –

earlier, with the increasing gain value (thus, increasing 𝜃 parameter), “f ” decreases. For a single-
stage detector, at a ﬁxed ampliﬁcation gap, increasing the electric ﬁeld (Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿) leads to
an increase of the relative frequency of the ionizing collisions; therefore, according to eqn. 2.5,
resulting in a reduction of the relative variance [32].

It was also found that for the same gain value, the relative gain variance is higher for a
double-stage conﬁguration than for the single-stage one. This is expected, since in a double-stage
conﬁguration, the electric ﬁeld per stage is lower than in a single-stage one, resulting in a decrease
of the ionization probability. Also, the loss of electrons while transferred from the pre-ampliﬁcation
stage and the RPWELL ampliﬁcation one gives rise to the additional avalanche-size ﬂuctuations.

It should be mentioned here that, for the double-stage conﬁguration under X-ray irradiation, the
maximum applied Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿 was limited to 650 V, with a Δ𝑉𝑇 𝐻 𝐺𝐸 𝑀 = 700 V. At these voltage
conﬁgurations, the maximal achievable gain was ∼4 × 105 , with a corresponding 𝜃 parameter for
single electrons of ∼0.38 (Fig. 2(c)).

𝐸𝑇 𝑟 𝑎𝑛𝑠 𝑓 𝑒𝑟 = 0.5 kV/cm. 𝐸𝐷𝑟 𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 = 0 kV/cm. In both plots, the statistical error bars are too small to be
seen.

Numerically-estimated single-electron detection eﬃciency values are plotted in Fig. 3(a) as
a function of 𝜃 for diﬀerent avalanche-electrons thresholds. Note that even at low 𝜃 values, e.g.
∼0.25, a high eﬃciency (> 90%) can be obtained with a threshold of 104 electrons or less. The
comparison of the relative eﬃciency between the experimental estimate and the numerical one is
presented in Fig. 3(b). The good agreement validates the numerical analysis method.

A comparison of numerically-estimated eﬃciencies for diﬀerent gain values in the single and
double-stage detectors is given in Table 5.1. The avalanche-electron threshold was ﬁxed to 104
electrons. The eﬃciency of a detector having an exponential distribution, for the same gain values,
was estimated for comparison. It was found that for the same gain value, the single-stage detector
provides better eﬃciency than that of the double-stage detector due to the higher 𝜃-value. However,
with the increase of the gain, the diﬀerence reduces. Note that the eﬃciency value for an exponential
distribution at the gain of 2.1 × 106 is a hypothetical one. It was reached with the double-stage

conﬁgurations.

5.2 Double-stage RPWELL - gain and 𝜃 dependence on THGEM voltage

We studied the eﬀect of Δ𝑉𝑇 𝐻 𝐺𝐸 𝑀 on the gain and on the 𝜃 parameter for a ﬁxed Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿. The
drift and transfer ﬁelds were kept at 0 and 0.5 kV/cm, respectively.

𝜃 variation as a function of the total gain. 𝐸𝑇 𝑟 𝑎𝑛𝑠 𝑓 𝑒𝑟 = 0.5 kV/cm and 𝐸𝐷𝑟 𝑖 𝑓 𝑡 = 0 kV/cm.

Fig. 4(a) shows the gain dependency on Δ𝑉𝑇 𝐻 𝐺𝐸 𝑀 for two diﬀerent values of Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿 and
with Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿 for a ﬁxed Δ𝑉𝑇 𝐻 𝐺𝐸 𝑀 . Δ𝑉𝑇 𝐻 𝐺𝐸 𝑀 was limited to 800 V before the occurrence
of occasional discharges, resulting in a maximum gain of ∼ 2.8 × 105 for Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿 = 500 V.
For the two other conﬁgurations, with higher applied Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿-values, gains up to ∼ 2.1 × 106
were reached under stable conditions. The dependency of the 𝜃 parameter on the gain (Fig. 4(b)) is
roughly the same for the three conﬁgurations.

5.3 Double-stage RPWELL with diﬀerent gas mixtures

5.3.1 Eﬀect of quencher concentration

The dependence of single-electron spectral shape and, consequently, of the 𝜃 parameter, on the
quencher concentration has been studied in Ne/CH4 mixtures, having 2, 5, 10 and 15% CH4
concentrations. Fig. 5(a) depicts the single-electron spectra for equal gain of ∼ 1.4 × 105 for the
four-quencher concentrations. One can notice the more pronounced Polya peak at the lower CH4
concentrations.

Fig. 5(b) shows the trends of the gain with respect to Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿 for the four diﬀerent
concentrations. In all measurements, Δ𝑉𝑇 𝐻 𝐺𝐸 𝑀 was set to the highest value allowing for stable,
discharge-free operation to maximize the electron extraction eﬃciency from the photocathode. The
dependence of 𝜃 parameter and relative variance f -parameter on the gain, at diﬀerent quencher
concentrations, are shown in Fig. 5(c) and Fig. 5(d), respectively. In presence of the quencher, the
ratio of ionizing versus other inelastic collisions is shifted in favor of the other inelastic scattering

[32]. Therefore, the avalanche size distribution broadens up (according to eqn. 2.5 and 2.6) with
the increase of quencher, thus, the relative variance “f ” increases. This in turn, results in higher 𝜃
parameter values for lower quencher concentrations - as also depicted in Fig. 5(c).

The single-electron detection eﬃciency for two diﬀerent values of gain in the four-quencher
concentration is given in Table 5.3.1. With an avalanche-electron threshold of 104 electrons, for the
lower gain value of ∼6 × 104, the eﬃciency in Ne/2%CH4 is ∼4% higher than that of Ne/15%CH4.
This rather small diﬀerence is due to the higher 𝜃 value in lower quencher concentrations. However,
with the increase of gain, the diﬀerence between the measured 𝜃 values decreases and the detector
reaches full eﬃciency for quencher concentrations of 2 − 15%.

5.3.2 Eﬀects of the carrier gas

The dependence of the 𝜃 parameter on the carrier gas, for a ﬁxed CH4 quencher concentration were
studied. Fig. 6(a) shows single-electron spectra in Ne/5%CH4 and Ar/5%CH4, for similar gain
values of ∼105, adjusted by setting diﬀerent Δ𝑉𝑇 𝐻 𝐺𝐸 𝑀 values. The gain curves as function of
Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿 are shown in Fig. 6(b). The operation in Ar/5%CH4 required higher Δ𝑉𝑇 𝐻 𝐺𝐸 𝑀 and
Δ𝑉𝑅𝑃𝑊 𝐸 𝐿𝐿 values. The maximum achievable gain is higher in the Ne-based mixture, by at least an
order of magnitude, as previously observed in [21, 38]. The dependence of 𝜃 and f on the gain in
these two gas mixtures are shown in Fig. 6(c) and Fig. 6(d), respectively. In Ne/5%CH4, the f value
is slightly lower than in Ar/5%CH4; it agrees with measurements in Micromegas detectors [32, 34].
In Ar-based mixtures, due to the lower threshold for excitation and larger inelastic cross-section,
the ionization yield is lower, thus enhancing avalanche ﬂuctuations.

The numerically estimated single-electron detection eﬃciency for two diﬀerent values of gain
in Ne/5%CH4 and Ar/5%CH4 is given in Table 5.3.2. For the lower gain value of ∼4 × 104, the
eﬃciency in Ne/5%CH4 is slightly higher than in Ar/5%CH4 due to the higher 𝜃 value. However,
with the increase of gain, the diﬀerence between the eﬃciencies is smaller.

6 Summary and discussion

In this work, we investigated single-electron spectra obtained with single-stage and double-stage
RPWELL-based detectors. The goal was to evaluate the potential advantage of their operation in
conditions yielding Polya-like single distributions; the latter result from charge-avalanche saturation
in the RPWELL holes. The detectors’ response was single-photoelectrons emitted from a CsI

– 12 –

photocathode deposited on the multiplier’s surface. Their performance was studied in various gas
mixtures and electric-ﬁeld settings.

Operating in Ne/5%CH4, the single-stage RPWELL detector reached gains of ∼2.5 × 105 in
a discharge-free mode; the single-electron Polya-like distribution had a 𝜃-value of ∼0.36. The
double-stage THGEM/RPWELL detector reached gains of ∼2.1 × 106 in stable conditions; the
Polya-like distribution reached a 𝜃-value of ∼0.6.

Similar trends are shown for the variation of the Polya parameters 𝜃 and f as a function of
gain in both RPWELL detector conﬁgurations. Note, however, that for equal gain, the single-stage
detector yielded more pronounced Polya-like distributions, with higher 𝜃-value and thus narrower
relative gain variance f . This is expected since in a double-stage conﬁguration, the electric ﬁeld
per stage is lower than in a single-stage one, resulting in a decrease of the ionization probability
(gain ﬂuctuations) with respect to other inelastic processes. In addition, avalanche-electron losses
between the two stages result in additional avalanche-size ﬂuctuations.

The experimental values of 𝜃 and gain, followed by numerical calculations, yielded the single-
electron detection-eﬃciency values; they are presented as function of the threshold (number of
avalanche-electrons). For a given threshold of 104 electrons, the numerical estimation suggests that
for a same gain of ∼6 × 104, the eﬃciency in the single-stage detector (∼91%) is superior to that of
the double-stage one (∼87.5%), due to the higher 𝜃 value. Also, for the single-stage detector, relative
to an exponential distribution at the same gain, the expected single-electron detection eﬃciency is
about ∼6% higher (91% relative to 86%). However, with the increase of the gain, for the same
threshold, both detectors attain similar eﬃciency values. The double-stage detector yielded an
eﬃciency of ∼97% at a gain of ∼2 × 105, with 𝜃 = 0.3. In the presence of 5.9 keV X-ray, the
maximal achievable stable gain is limited to ∼4 × 105 , with a 𝜃 value of ∼0.38 and 99% detection
eﬃciency.

The amount of quencher added to the carrier gas has a major role in reducing instabilities,
which are mainly due to photon-induced secondary avalanches. It also aﬀects the electron-transport
parameters and enhances the extraction eﬃciency of photoelectrons from the photocathode in a
single-photon detector (the matter is out of the scope of this work). We studied the eﬀect of the CH4
quencher concentration on the detector properties, gain, 𝜃 and the relative gain variance f . It was
observed that with increasing quencher concentration, 𝜃-value decreased, and f increased - for a
given gain value. With an electron threshold of 104, for a gain of 6 × 104, the 2% CH4 concentration
yielded higher eﬃciency (89.5%) than that of 15% CH4 (85.5% eﬃciency) due to a lower 𝜃 value
in the latter case. But, with the increase of gain, the quencher concentration did not aﬀect the
eﬃciency signiﬁcantly, for the same threshold. Relative to an exponential distribution at a similar
gain of ∼6 × 104, the single-electron eﬃciency improved by ∼5% for 2% quencher concentration
and by ∼1% for 15% quencher concentration.

The dependence of 𝜃 and f on the carrier gas was evaluated for a given CH4 quencher concen-
tration. Signiﬁcant avalanche ﬂuctuations were observed in Ar/5%CH4; it is due to low ionization
yield resulting in higher relative gain variance. Ne/5%CH4, with lower avalanche ﬂuctuations,
showed a higher breakdown limit - thus a lower discharge probability. Therefore, Ne/CH4 proved
to be superior to Ar/CH4 in detecting single-photoelectrons. The numerical study suggested that
depending on the electron threshold, at lower gains, the detector operation in Ne/CH4 yields higher
eﬃciency than in Ar/CH4; with increasing gain, both mixtures reach similar eﬃciency values,

– 13 –

e.g. ∼98% at 2.5 × 105. Relative to an exponential distribution at lower gain, the single-electron
eﬃciency improved by ∼1% for Ar/5%CH4 and by ∼4% for Ne/5%CH4.
