Abstract 

A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that inert gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn) 

become  less  and  less  inert  under  increasing  pressure.  Here  we  use  the  ab  initio  evolutionary  algorithm  to 

predict stable compounds of Xe and Na at pressures below 100 GPa, and find three stable compounds, NaXe, 

NaXe3 and NaXe4. The NaXe belongs to a well-known cubic CsCl structure type. The NaXe4’s structure is 

common  in  amphiboles,  whereas  the  NaXe3  has  a  unique  structure,  analogous  to  the  “post-perovskite” 

orthorhombic CaIrO3-type structure with Ir atoms removed. This is the first time that a cation-vacant version 

of the CaIrO3 is found in any compound. NaXe, NaXe3 and NaXe4 are found to be metallic.   

Introduction 

Inert (or “noble”) gases have closed valence shell - it is difficult to remove from or add to it an electron, 

or to share electrons with other atoms. This inertness decreases from light (He, Ne) to heavy (Xe, Rn) noble 

gases, and with increasing pressure. One should distinguish four situations: 

(1)  van der Waals compounds, which are stabilized under pressure because of denser packing of two (or 

more) atoms of different size. For example, at the pressure of 4.78 GPa, Somayazulu discovered a 
stable Xe-H compound [give formula] 6. 

(2)  Neutral insertion of noble gases into ionic or electride structures. Examples are Na2He and Na2OHe 

[Dong]25 and such compounds as CaF2He and MgF2He [Miao and Zurek]26. 

(3)  bonding with electronegative elements. For example, Xe forms stable fluorides already  at ambient 

pressure (Bartlett, 1960s), and stable oxides at pressures >74 GPa (Zhu; Pickard) – whereas He would 

require terapascal pressures to form stable compounds with F or O. There is evidence for incorporation 
of Xe into quartz (SiO2) at rather low pressures (0.7-5 GPa) and elevated temperatures (500-1500 K)4.   

(4)  bonding with electropositive elements. For example, Xe forms stable compounds with Fe and Ni at 

150–350 GPa3.   

Here  we  consider  the  latter  situation,  where  a  noble  gas  forms  a  stable  compound  with  a  highly 

electropositive  element.  Large  electronegativity  difference  should  stabilize  such  compounds.  On  the  other 

hand,  Xe  should  form  such  compounds  more  easily,  as  its  outer  electrons  are  more  polarizable,  i.e.  more 

susceptible to  external  influence  and  more  prone  to  chemical  bonding.  Indeed,  at  relatively  low  pressures 

 
 
 
of >43 GPa we predict the stability of NaXe, NaXe3 is predicted to appear at pressures >63 GPa and NaXe4 is 

predicted to appear at pressures > 82 GPa.

become stable at 43 GPa, Cmcm-NaXe3 become stable at 63 GPa and C2/m-NaXe4 become stable at 82 GPa, 

respectively,  and  remain  stable  at  least  up  to  100  GPa  (Fig.  1a).Our  phase  diagram  also  shows  predicted 
transitions in elemental Na (bcc to fcc), which has been reported before7,8, and the phase transition in Xe (fcc 
to hcp), which is also known from experiments 9,10. Fig. 1b shows that the enthalpy of formation of NaXe, 

NaXe3  and  NaXe4  become  much  more  negative  with  pressure,  i.e.  these  compounds  become  much  more 

exothermic. One can also see that other stoichiometries, namely Na2Xe15, Na2Xe9, NaXe2, Na2Xe, Na9Xe, 

Na7Xe3 and Na2Xe7, come close to the convex hull (Fig. 1b) and might become stable at pressures higher than 

_
100  GPa.  Phonon  calculations  for  Pm 3

 m-NaXe,  Cmcm-NaXe3  and  C2/m-NaXe4  show  no  imaginary 

frequencies,  indicating  that  compounds  are  dynamically  stable  in  the  pressure  range  of  their  stability. At 

ambient pressure all structures have imaginary phonon frequencies (Fig.4-6 Supplementary), and are therefore 

not quenchable to ambient conditions.

Structural features and the origin of metallicity   

_
Structural parameters of Pm3

_
m-NaXe, Cmcm-NaXe3 and C2/m-NaXe4 are listed in Table 1. Pm3

m -NaXe 

has a well-known CsCl-type cubic structure (Fig. 2a), where atoms of both types have 8-fold coordination. 
The structure of C2/m-NaXe4 (Fig. 2b) is common in amphibole and usually in metamorphic rocks24. Cmcm-

NaXe3 has a very unusual structure (Fig. 2c), which can be derived from the CaIrO3-type (“post-perovskite”) 

structure  (Fig.  2d)  by  removing  the  small  cation  (Ir). The  phase  of  MgSiO3  CaIrO3-type  structure  (“post-

 
 
 
perovskite”) is believed to be the main mineral phase of the Earth's lowermost mantle (the D'' layer)11. All 

known post-perovskite phases have ABX3 stoichiometry; Cmcm-NaXe3 is the first post-perovskite phase with 

stoichiometry BX3. Comparing the two structures, one can see that in Cmcm-NaXe3 structure is equivalent to 

that Na replaces Ca, Xe replaces O and Ir is deleted.   

Cation-deleted versions of the perovskite structure are well known – deleting the large cation, one obtains 

the ReO3 structure type. Deleting the small cation, one obtains the Cu3Au structure, which is nothing but an 

ordered version of the cubic close packed structure. Cation-deleted versions of the post-perovskite structure 

were not known to us before, but Cmcm-NaXe3 gives the first example of such a structure, with the deletion 

of the small cation. In this structure, each Na atom is coordinated by 8 Xe atoms.

Calculated electronic band structures (Fig. 3) show that Pm3

m -NaXe, Cmcm-NaXe3 and C2/m-NaXe4 

are metallic: in NaXe three bands, in NaXe3 four bands and in NaXe4 four bands cross the Fermi level. While 

NaXe has an odd number of electrons per unit cell and therefore has have half-filled bands, NaXe3 and NaXe4 

have an even number of electrons and could be an insulator, yet is also a metal. They all have band structure 

similar to n-doped semiconductors: there is a gap (~2.7 eV) between fully occupied and partially filled bands. 

The latter can be viewed as electrons brought by the Na atoms and donated to whole crystal.

_
In Fig.4 we compare the calculated electronic densities of states of Pm3

m -NaXe (43 GPa), Cmcm-NaXe3 (63 

GPa) and C2/m-NaXe4 (82 GPa) with the densities of states obtained by removing Na atoms. One can see that 

removal of Na atoms makes the structures insulating, but we also see a considerable interaction of Na and Xe 

electrons in the upper 2-3 eV of the valence band.   

In order to further understand the fate of the electrons brought by Na atoms, we performed Bader analysis 
_
(Table 2)12-15. This analysis shows that each Na atom loses 0.69 electrons in Pm3

m-NaXe, 0.74 electrons in 

Cmcm-NaXe3  and  0.76  electrons  in  C2/m-NaXe4.  Fig.  5  shows  the  electron  density  corresponding  to  the 

uppermost 2 eV in the valence band (i.e. the distribution of the electrons with energies [-2 eV; 0]), one can see 

strong asphericity of Xe atoms and their polarization towards the nearest Na atom in Cmcm-NaXe3.

Conclusions 
By employing the evolutionary algorithm USPEX, we have predicted two new stable compounds in the Na-

_
Xe system in the pressure range 0-100 GPa: Pm3

m -NaXe (stable at >43 GPa and up to at least 100 GPa), 

Cmcm-NaXe3 (stable at >63 GPa and up to at least 100 GPa) and C2/m-NaXe4 (stable at >82 GPa and up to 

at least 100 GPa). NaXe3 has a unique structure related to post-perovskite CaIrO3-type structure. Electronic 

_
structure calculations suggest that Pm3

m -NaXe, Cmcm-NaXe3 and C2/m-NaXe4 are metals, where Na donates 

its electrons to the conduction band; according to Bader analysis, these electrons are mostly assigned to Xe 

atoms. The latter do not behave as fully inert; instead, the electrons of Na and Xe are coupled, and we see Xe 

atoms polarizing towards neighboring Na atoms in Cmcm-NaXe3. Despite becoming stable at relatively low 

pressures, NaXe, NaXe3 and NaXe4 will not survive decompression to ambient pressure.   

Methods 
The evolutionary algorithm USPEX17 is used here to predict new stable structures. It searches for the lowest 

enthalpy structure under pressures of 0 GPa, 50 GPa, and 100 GPa, and can predict stable compounds and the 
element ratio of the structure. A number of applications illustrate its power 5,7,17,18. In order to make the search 

more thorough, after obtaining the element ratio of the structure, continue to search for the fixed composition 

(The calculation results of some definite components are in the Supplementary). Structure relaxations were 
performed using DFT within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional19 in the framework of the all-
electron projector augmented wave (PAW) method20, as implemented in the VASP code21。For Na atoms we 
used PAW potentials with 1.4 a.u. core radius and 2s22p63s1 electrons treated as valence. For Xe the core radius 
was  1.45  a.u.  and  4s24p64d105s25p6  electrons  were  treated  as  valence. We  use  500  eV  plane-wave  kinetic 
energy cutoff, EDIFF is set to 10-8, and the structure parameters have good convergence. The first-generation 

structures are randomly created, all structures relax under constant pressure and 0 K, and enthalpy is used as 

the fitness. The worst energy structure (40%) was discarded and a new generation was created, 30% of which 

were random and 70% from the lowest enthalpy structure through heredity, lattice mutation and transmutation. 

In addition, in order to determine the thermodynamically stable structure, the formation energy of the structure   

was calculated:  Ef =

((cid:2904)(cid:2925)(cid:2930)(cid:2911)(cid:2922)((cid:2898)(cid:2911)(cid:3182) (cid:2908)(cid:2915)(cid:3183))(cid:2879)(cid:2934)(cid:2904)(cid:2925)(cid:2930)

((cid:2898)(cid:2911))(cid:2879)(cid:2935)(cid:2904)(cid:2925)(cid:2930)

((cid:2908)(cid:2915)))

((cid:2934)(cid:2878)(cid:2935))

  . The structure with negative formation energy is 

thermodynamically stable and has the possibility of stable existence. In order to judge the dynamic stability   

_
of the structure, the phonon spectrums of Pm3
m -NaXe (0 GPa and 43 GPa), Cmcm-NaXe3(0GPa and 63 GPa) 
and C2/m-NaXe4 (0 GPa and 82GPa) were calculated with PHONOPY code 22. In order to obtain the energy 

band structure, we use VASP to calculate the PBE energy band. Bader charge analysis and local charge density 
were used to analyze the charge transfer near the Fermi level 12-15. VASPKIT code is used in data processing 
16.
