ABSTRACT
We study the physical mechanism of a major X-class solar ﬂare that occurred in the super NOAA active
region (AR) 12192 using a data-driven numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling complemented with
observations. With the evolving magnetic ﬁelds observed at the solar surface as bottom boundary input, we
drive an MHD system to evolve self-consistently in correspondence with the realistic coronal evolution. During
a two-day time interval, the modeled coronal ﬁeld has been slowly stressed by the photospheric ﬁeld evolution,
which gradually created a large-scale coronal current sheet, i.e., a narrow layer with intense current, in the core
of the AR. The current layer was successively enhanced until it became so thin that a tether-cutting reconnection
between the sheared magnetic arcades was set in, which led to a ﬂare. The modeled reconnecting ﬁeld lines
and their footpoints match well the observed hot ﬂaring loops and the ﬂare ribbons, respectively, suggesting
that the model has successfully “reproduced” the macroscopic magnetic process of the ﬂare. In particular, with
simulation, we explained why this event is a conﬁned eruption–the consequent of the reconnection is the shared
arcade instead of a newly formed ﬂux rope. We also found much weaker magnetic implosion effect comparing
to many other X-class ﬂares.

1. INTRODUCTION
Solar ﬂares are sudden release of excess magnetic energy
in the solar corona, a plasma environment dominated by the
magnetic ﬁeld (Shibata & Magara 2011). Magnetic recon-
nection is believed to be the central mechanism that converts
free magnetic energy into radiation, energetic particle acceler-
ation, and kinetic energy of plasma (Forbes et al. 2006). Con-
sequently, revealing the magnetic structures associated with
reconnection and their evolution during ﬂares is essential for
understanding of the ﬂare dynamics (Priest & Forbes 2002).

Due to the lack of direct measurements of coronal magnetic
ﬁelds, it is a prevailing way to postulate the ﬂare magnetic
evolution from the observed variations of ﬂare plasma emis-
sion. This is because the plasma emission can reﬂects the
geometry of the invisible magnetic ﬁeld, as in most part of the
corona, the plasma is “frozen” with the magnetic ﬁelds. Early
studies of typical eruptive ﬂares have converged to a standard
ﬂare model (CSHKP, Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hi-
rayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976), which describes the
essence of ﬂare physics. The standard model mainly concerns
a magnetically bipolar source region, the simplest form of so-
lar active regions (ARs), proposing that a twisted magnetic
ﬂux rope (corresponding to a ﬁlament) rises above the polar-
ity inversion line (PIL), stretches the overlying closed ﬁeld
lines (manifested as coronal loop expansion), and produces
a vertical current sheet (CS) underneath where reconnection

sets in and results in two parallel chromospheric ﬂare ribbons
on both sides of the PIL. The ﬂare ribbons are suggested as
the footprints of the reconnecting ﬁeld lines. They gradu-
ally move apart from one another as the reconnection goes on.
Meanwhile, the ejecting ﬂux rope eventually travels into solar
wind as being a coronal mass ejection (CME), leaving behind
bright ﬂaring loops that correspond to the re-closed magnetic
arcades after the reconnection. Such dynamic picture inferred
from observations is usually represented by simple cartoons6.
Recent observations with high spatial/time resolution and
multi-wavelength imagers show that numerous solar ﬂares are
characterized by complex processes that are not present in the
standard model, such as multi-stage and multi-place of ﬁla-
ment ejections in the same event (e.g., Liu et al. 2009; Schri-
jver & Title 2011; Shen et al. 2012; Romano et al. 2015),
escape of homologous ﬂux ropes (e.g., Li & Zhang 2013),
slipping motions of ﬂare loops (e.g., Aulanier et al. 2007; Li
& Zhang 2015; Dudík et al. 2016; Gou et al. 2016), ﬂare rib-
bons of unusual shapes (e.g., quasi-circular and even tri-linear
shapes, Masson et al. 2009; Wang & Liu 2012; Wang et al.
2014), multiple ribbons like remote ﬂare ribbons distinct from
the eruptive core site (or the secondary ribbon, e.g., Zhang
et al. 2014), the EUV late phase after the main (impulsive)
phase in certain ﬂares (Woods et al. 2011; Dai et al. 2013;
Liu et al. 2013) and etc. There are also ﬂares without CMEs,
which are usually called conﬁned ﬂares. Some conﬁned ﬂares
occur with ﬁlament eruptions but failing to escape their over-
lying ﬁeld (Ji et al. 2003; Török & Kliem 2005; Guo et al.
2010). The others, simply without any eruption, are the most
hard to interpret solely from observations, because very small
changes of the coronal conﬁguration can be detected in these
ﬂares (e.g., Jiang et al. 2012; Dalmasse et al. 2015).

To understand the mechanisms of the various complex
or atypical ﬂares requires us to characterize the realistic
magnetic conﬁgurations and their evolution associated with

ﬂares. Also, from the point of view of prediction of space
weather, which is heavily inﬂuenced by solar eruptions, a
much more accurate understanding and reproducing of the
eruption process beyond the standard or theory model is
strongly required. Existing techniques to this end include
static non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) reconstruction (see
review papers by Wiegelmann & Sakurai 2012; Régnier
2013), data-constrained/driven magneto-frictional (MF) evo-
lution method (e.g., Cheung & DeRosa 2012; Yeates 2014;
Savcheva et al. 2015; Fisher et al. 2015), data-constrained
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations (e.g., Jiang et al.
2012; Jiang et al. 2013; Kliem et al. 2013; Amari et al. 2014;
Inoue et al. 2014, 2015), and more generally, the data-driven
MHD simulations (e.g., Wu et al. 2006).

Among the available techniques, the NLFFF reconstruc-
tion is used most frequently because a variety of approaches
and codes for solving NLFFF have been developed within in
a relatively long history (e.g., Grad & Rubin 1958; Saku-
rai 1981; Yang et al. 1986; Wu et al. 1990; Amari et al.
1997; Yan & Sakurai 2000; He & Wang 2006; Wiegelmann
& Neukirch 2006; Wheatland 2006; Valori et al. 2010; Jiang
& Feng 2012), and prove to be successful for studying snap-
shots of the coronal ﬁelds before and after ﬂares. Signature
of ﬂare mechanism can usually be suggested from analysis of
the pre-ﬂare magnetic ﬁelds. For example, through studying
the magnetic topology, critical magnetic structures relevant to
ﬂares, such as magnetic ﬂux rope, magnetic null points, bald
patch (Titov et al. 1993), and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs,
Demoulin et al. 1996; Titov et al. 2002) could be revealed.
However, analyzing the pre-ﬂare ﬁelds cannot tell directly
why and how the ﬂares occur. The lack of dynamics is a
major limitation of NLFFF reconstruction, which cannot be
used for “reconstruction” of magnetic ﬁeld during ﬂares. The
limitation exists similarly in the MF methods. Although in
such methods, a dynamic velocity is included for making the
magnetic ﬁeld “evolves”, this velocity is actually pseudo since
it is determined only by the Lorentz force (i.e., the veloctiy
v = J × B/ν where ν is the frictional coefﬁcient) while the
inertia and pressure of the plasma is neglected (Yang et al.
1986). As a result, the MF approach are still limited for the
quasi-static evolution phase of the corona ﬁeld. When used
for modeling the magnetic ﬁeld evolution, the MF method
is essentially similar to the way using a time-sequence of
NLFFF or MHD models reconstructed independently from a
series of vector magnetogram along time to mimic the coro-
nal evolution, although in the MF method, the magnetic ﬁelds
for each time snapshot are treated to be dependent on its pre-
ceding one. It is still problematic to use the MF method to
simulate the ﬂare and eruption phase in which the plasma
is in extremely dynamic evolution and often associated with
magnetic reconnections, although such way has been used in
analysis of evolution of ﬂare ribbons (e.g., Savcheva et al.
2015; Savcheva et al. 2016; Janvier et al. 2016). The data-
driven MHD model of Wu et al. (2006), however, just uses
the line-of-sight magnetograms, and thus the non-potentiality
of the coronal ﬁeld cannot be fully recovered. There are mod-
els (Kliem et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2013; Amari et al. 2014;
Inoue et al. 2014) using the NLFFF reconstructed or MF cal-
culated coronal ﬁeld immediately preceding eruption (thus the
unstable nature of the ﬁeld has already well developed) as the
initial condition for MHD simulation, which prove to be able
to reproduce the fast dynamic phase of the erupting ﬁeld (e.g.,
Jiang et al. 2013). However, these kinds of simulations do not
self-consistently show how the pre-eruptive ﬁeld is formed

and disrupted, and thus may not be used to identify the true
triggering mechanism. Also, such kind of models might not
be able to reproduce conﬁned ﬂare, which is not likely trig-
gered by the large-scale instability of the pre-ﬂare magnetic
ﬁeld.

To self-consistently and realistically simulate the coronal
evolution from its pre-ﬂare to ﬂare phases, we have developed
a new data-driven 3D MHD AR evolution (DARE) model.
The DARE model is based on the full MHD equation with
its lower boundary driven directly by the solar vector mag-
netograms, which is unique among all the aforementioned
models that attempt to simulate the realistic coronal magnetic
evolution. In the ﬁrst application of this model (Jiang et al.
2016), we modeled the evolution of a complex multi-polar
AR with ﬂux emergence over two days leading to an erup-
tive, also atypical ﬂare. The simulation reasonably recreated
the whole process from a long quasi-static evolution to the
eruptive stage of extreme dynamics.
It was shown that the
ﬁeld morphology resembles the sequence of the correspond-
ing EUV images from SDO/AIA for such process, in addition
to the successful match of the timing of the ﬂare onset.

In this paper, we propose to use the DARE model to study
a distinctly different event, a conﬁned major X-class ﬂare oc-
curred in the super NOAA AR 12192 on October 2014. This
AR is “super” because of its size, which is the largest of all
ARs during the last 25 years. It produced a series of X-class
ﬂares without eruptions, and the strongest one in the series
reaches X3.1, which sets a record in the ﬂare energy for CME-
less events (Thalmann et al. 2015) since the conﬁned ﬂares
ever observed were predominantly below X-class (Yashiro
et al. 2006). A series of studies have been inspired to ex-
plain why these extremely powerful ﬂares did not lead to erup-
tions (Jing et al. 2015; Sun et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2015; Inoue
et al. 2016). Here we are curious why and how did these ﬂares
occur, or more speciﬁcally, what is the evolution of the mag-
netic ﬁelds underlying these non-eruptive ﬂares in AR 12192?
We attempt to answer this question by simulating the coro-
nal magnetic ﬁeld evolution of the AR leading to the X3.1
ﬂare. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The ﬂare
event to be studied are described in Section 2. Then the DARE
model is brieﬂy presented in Section 3. Results are given in
Section 4 and ﬁnally discussions in Section 5.

2. EVENT
Since overview of the AR 12192 and its unusual feature,
that is, extremely large size, rich of X-class ﬂare but CME-
poor, has been described well in the literature (Thalmann et al.
2015; Sun et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2015; Jing et al. 2015; Chen
et al. 2015), we focus on the X3.1 event and the relevant in-

formation with our modeling.
from 2014 October 23 to 24, AR 12192 is close to the cen-
tral meridian. Two major sunspots are well separated by a
distance of roughly 100 Mm (see Figure 1a). The target ﬂare
occurred around 21:00 UT, October 24, and it lasts for an un-
usual long duration of more than one hour with the GOES X-
ray ﬂux above X class. Preceding the major ﬂare are relatively
small ones of C- and M-class with shorter durations. When
inspecting the SDO/AIA images (for instance, Figure 1b) one
only see a series of brightening of coronal loops without much
changes in their shape. The ﬂare loops are seen connecting the
boundaries of the strong magnetic polarities.
Interestingly,
there is also a set of rather long loops with remote connection
to the southwest corner of the ﬁeld of view as shown (e.g.,
Sun et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2015). Chromospheric ribbons of

structed an approximately force-free coronal magnetic
ﬁeld (Jiang & Feng 2013) corresponding to a pre-ﬂare in-
stance of 00:00 UT on 2014 October 23. Then, with this ﬁeld
as the initial condition, we numerically solved the full set of
time-dependent, 3D MHD equations in the modeling volume.
The bottom boundary of the model is assumed as being the
coronal base, thus the magnetic ﬁeld measured on the photo-
sphere is used as a reasonable approximation of the ﬁeld at the
coronal base. Then the evolving solar surface magnetic ﬁelds
from observation provide the time-dependent bottom bound-
ary conditions for the simulation domain. We smoothed the
original SHARP data before inputting them into the numer-
ical model. This is necessary since the magnetic structures
are broadened from the photosphere to the coronal base. We
simulated such broadening using Gauss smoothing of the data
with Gaussian window of σ = 2 arcsec as suggested by Ya-
mamoto & Kusano (2012). We further smoothed the data
in time with Gaussian window of σ = 4 × 12 min to remove
short-term temporal oscillations and mitigate the problem of
data spikes due to bad pixels. Interpolation in time was em-
ployed to ﬁll small data gaps in the two days of observation.
In addition to the magnetic ﬁeld, we also need to give a
model of plasma in the computation. Here, the plasma is
initialized in a hydrostatic, isothermal state with T = 106 K
(sound speed cS = 128 km s−1) in solar gravity.
Its density
is conﬁgured to make the plasma β as small as 2 × 10−3 (the
maximal Alfvén vA is 4 Mm s−1) to mimic the coronal low-β
and highly tenuous conditions. The plasma thermodynamics
are simpliﬁed as an adiabatic energy equation since we focus
on the evolution of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. No explicit re-
sistivity is included in the magnetic induction equation, and
magnetic reconnection is still allowed due to numerical dif-
fusion if any CS forms and becomes thin enough with thick-
ness close to the grid resolution (i.e., the smallest grid). A
small kinematic viscosity ν is used with its value correspond-
ing to the viscous diffusion time as ∼ 102 of the Alfvén time
in strong-ﬁeld regions. This is usually necessary for the sake
of numerical stability in the long term computation. The units
of length and time in the model are L = 23 Mm (approximately
32 arcsec on the Sun) and τ = L/cS = 180 s, respectively.

Solution of the MHD equations is implemented by an
advanced space-time high-accuracy scheme (AMR–CESE–
MHD, Jiang et al. 2010). We use a non-uniform grid based on
the magnetic ﬂux distribution for the sake of saving computa-
tional resources. The smallest grid ∆x = ∆y = ∆z = 1.4 Mm
(approximately 2 arcsec on the Sun) is made around the
AR core region (approximately [−100, 100] × [−100, 100] ×
[0, 100] Mm3), where the magnetic ﬁelds are strong and
evolve actively. Grid size is increased gradually to 4∆x near
the side and top boundaries.

To further save the computing time, the cadence of the in-
put HMI data into the MHD model was increased by 20 times.
By this, the model run of a realistic two-day AR evolution can
be ﬁnished within about ten hours of wall time when paral-
lelized with a medium number (for example, a hundred) of
CPUs (3 GHz). Compressing of the time in HMI data is jus-
tiﬁed by the fact that the speed of photospheric ﬂows as mea-
sured from the photospheric ﬁeld evolution is about 0.1 ∼ 1
km s−1 (Welsch et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2012). So in our model
settings, the evolution speed of the boundary ﬁeld, even en-
hanced by a factor of 20, is still sufﬁciently small compared
with the coronal Alfvén speed (∼Mm s−1 ), and the basic re-
action of the coronal ﬁeld to the bottom changes should not

the ﬂare (Figure 1a) consist of mainly two bands on both sides
of the central part of the PIL. Distinct from typical two-ribbon
ﬂares, these two ribbons showed barely separation motion. As
such, the coronal conﬁguration changes are not easy to inter-
pret from these EUV observations.

3. THE DARE MODEL
In the DARE model (Jiang et al. 2016), we used the solar
surface magnetic ﬁeld data from the SDO/HMI (Schou et al.
2012), in particular, the Space weather HMI Active Region
Patches (SHARP) vector magnetogram data series (Hoek-
sema et al. 2014; Bobra et al. 2014). With the cadence of
12 min and the spatial resolution of 1 arcsec, the SHARP data
are adequate to track a relatively long-term evolution (hours to
days) of magnetic structures of the typical AR scale. To setup
the model, we considered a local Cartesian coordinate system
with its origin at the surface center of the AR, which is deﬁned
in the cylindrical equal area (CEA) re-mapped SHARP mag-
netogram. The 3D computational volume extends approxi-
mately [−450, 450] Mm in both x and y axes and 900 Mm
in z axis, which is sufﬁcient to include the large-scale mag-
netic ﬁeld related with the ﬂare. Furthermore, all the external
boundaries (except the bottom surface) are non-reﬂective. We
note that here the AR spans ∼ 60◦ of the solar sphere, much
larger than typical ARs, and the curvature of the associated
area should not be ignored. Thus the current modelling in
Cartesian box might not appropriately characterize the geom-
etry for the AR, and we keep in mind the possible inﬂuence
in discussing our modeled results.

Based on the HMI vector magnetogram, we ﬁrst con-

be affected. As a result, one hour in the HMI data equals one
τ in the simulation. When comparing the simulation with the
observations of the corona, such scaling of time (a τ equals an
hour) also applies to the quasi-static evolution phase without
major ﬂares or eruptions. This is because in such phase, the
coronal evolves in the same pace as the boundary, since any
change in the bottom boundary is reﬂected almost instantly in
the corona, which reaches its equilibrium very fast. But this
is not justiﬁed for the dynamic phases with major eruptions or
ﬂares, in which the evolution of the corona is determined by
itself rather than by the boundary. Thus, the time unit should
be the original one (a τ equals 180 s) in the ﬂare phase.

Coupling of the coronal evolution with the continuous
change of the surface magnetic ﬁeld (i.e., the HMI data) is
implemented by a time-dependent bottom boundary condi-
tion using the projected-characteristic method. Based on the
wave-decomposition principle of the full MHD system (Nak-
agawa et al. 1987; Wu et al. 2006), the method can nat-
urally mimic the transferring of magnetic energy and he-
licity to the corona from below (Wu et al. 2006) by self-
consistently calculating the surface ﬂow ﬁeld (Wang et al.
2008), which otherwise would have to be derived by lo-
cal correlation tracking or similar techniques (Welsch et al.
2004; Schuck 2008). As in our settings, the cadence of HMI
data is τ /5 = 36 s. However, the time step in the numerical
model is set as ∆t = CFL min(∆x/vA) = 0.2 s according to the
Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) stability condition (Courant
et al. 1967) with a CFL number of 0.5. We thus linearly inter-
polate the HMI data in time to produce a data set with cadence
matching the time step of the MHD model.

We followed the evolution of the MHD system for two days
from 00:00 UT of October 23 (t = 0) to 00:00 UT of October
25 (t = 48).

4. RESULTS
4.1. The initial state
In Figure 2 we show the magnetic conﬁguration derived
from the near force-free model for the initial state (t = 0) of the
MHD simulation. On the large scales, the AR exhibits a bi-
polar magnetic conﬁguration consisting of two main sunspots
with a relatively strong-sheared core ﬁelds embedded in a
less-sheared envelope ﬁelds. The core ﬁelds carry relatively
much stronger electric current (e.g., current density higher
than 20 times of the average value of the whole model box,
see Figure 2b, d and e) that is concentrated within a narrow
vertical layer roughly along the central part of the PIL sep-
arating the two major polarities. Such an association of in-
tense current layer with PIL of AR core might be common
for ﬂare-productive ARs (e.g., Sun et al. 2015). Here the cur-
rent layer extends from the bottom to a relatively large height
(∼ 35 Mm, see Figure 2d). From a visual comparison with
the EUV images (Figure 2a, b and c), the simulated magnetic
ﬁeld lines show good agreement with the observed coronal
loops. In particular, it can be seen that the weakly sheared en-
velope ﬁelds resemble the long cool loops imaged in the AIA
171 Å channel (about 1 MK), and the strongly sheared core
ﬁelds resemble the short hot loops imaged in the AIA 94 Å
channel (about 6 MK). This is likely due to heating by dis-
sipation of the strong current in the core region, making the
plasma there hotter than the surroundings. In the following
we show how this coronal ﬁeld evolved when driven by the
photospheric magnetic evolution.

4.2. Dynamic evolution
Figure 3 and its supplementary animation show how the
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld evolved over the two day time
period. Continuous movements of the polarities can be seen,
which could stress the coronal ﬁeld. For instance, a hori-
zontal ﬂow map derived for the time moment of 00:00 UT
on 2014 October 24 using the DAVE4VM method (Schuck
2008) demonstrates clearly a diverging motion of the two
main sunspots. Driven by the magnetic ﬁeld evolution at the
bottom, the MHD system continuously evolved in response.
The basic conﬁguration of the coronal ﬁeld shows no signiﬁ-
cant changes when we trace the magnetic ﬁeld lines (thus not
shown in the ﬁgures here), and the total kinetic energy main-
tains in a rather low level (less than 0.5 percent of the total
magnetic energy) without signiﬁcant variation in the whole
time interval, indicating that no eruption occurs in the simula-
tion. However, evolution of the distribution of electric current,
particularly the CS, a thin layer of intense current as deﬁned
below, provides instructive information that might be associ-
ated with the ﬂare processes.

Here we use a way following Gibson & Fan (2006) to lo-
cate the CS. It is deﬁned as the volume in which the ra-
tio of the current density to the magnetic ﬁeld strength, i.e.,
J/B, is greater than C/∆x, where ∆x is the local grid size
and the constant number C ∼ 1. Such a deﬁnition is reason-
able because J/B ∼ (∆B/B)/∆x, where ∆B denotes the gra-
dient of magnetic ﬁeld vectors in adjacent grid points, and
∆B/B << 1 in the smooth region of magnetic ﬁeld (except
regions with B ∼ 0, for example, near magnetic null points).
While a large value of ∆B/B ∼ 1 indicates signiﬁcant change
of magnetic ﬁeld (as large as the local ﬁeld strength) between
adjacent grid points. This means that the magnetic ﬁeld vec-
tors of distinctly different directions are squeezed extremely
close to each other, forming a narrow interface with strong
current, which is a CS in the context of our numerical model.
When the gradient of magnetic ﬁeld vectors across the CS
is steepened sufﬁciently, numerical diffusion will take effect
and “reconnection” could occur in the MHD model. In other
words, for such case, the inversely-directed magnetic compo-
nents on both sides of the CS are brought so close to each
other that they “merge” within the CS, resulting in new con-
nections of the corresponding magnetic ﬁeld lines, and thus
related to topological changes of the ﬁeld. By inspecting the
value of J/B, we ﬁnd a suitable value of C = 0.2 which can
well exclude the region of weak current, and such deﬁnition
gives the width of the CS of ∼ 3∆x. It should be noted here
the CS is different from that in theoretical view, i.e., an in-
ﬁnitely thin or simply a 2D surface rather than a ﬁnite volume.
The 3D shapes of the CS at different times are shown in Fig-
ure 4a (and also in its supplementary animation). A horizontal
slice of the volume is shown in Figure 4b, and a vertical slice
in Figure 4c. Initially (t = 0) the CS did not yet form, thus
there are only small-scale structures near the bottom surface.
Then, successive formation, expansion and shrinkage of the
CS volume are seen. From the plasma ﬂows and the Lorentz
force vectors around the CS volume, we can see that the ini-
tial current layer is gradually squeezed from both two sides
by the magnetic stress. Consequently it becomes thinner and
more intense, leading to increasing of the value J/B and thus
the formation of the CS as we deﬁned (J/B > 0.2∆x). At the
time of t = 36 (close to the peak stage of the CS development,
see below), the CS extends from the bottom of the simulated
domain up to heights of 50 Mm. With the slow evolution of

the basic conﬁguration, the CS also moves slowly from north
to south, but overall its location is roughly the same in whole
period. Interestingly, the pattern of reconnection-like plasma
ﬂow, i.e., horizontal inﬂow at both sides of the CS and ver-
tical outﬂow to up and down, can be seen (Figure 4b and c,
see t = 24 and 36, for example), suggesting that reconnection
might occur in the simulation.

We then calculated the following parameters to characterize
the CS evolution and to see whether reconnection occurred
within the CS:

1. Since in the evolution process the CS grows and decays
dynamically, for each time snapshot, we integrate J/B
for the full volume V of the CS as deﬁned above, which
gives a value ICS = (cid:82) J/BdV in unit of area, and can be
used to quantify the size or intensity of the evolving CS;

2. Furthermore, we calculated the rate of the magnetic en-
ergy injection into the CS by FCS = − (cid:82)
V ∇ ·
PdV , where P = 1
4π B × (v × B) is the Poynting ﬂux vec-
tor with v as the plasma velocity, and S is the surface
area of the CS volume V ;

S PdS = − (cid:82)

3. The total magnetic energy injected into the CS, i.e.,

EF = (cid:82) t

0 FCSdt at time t;

4. As here the CS is not a 2D surface but has a ﬁnite
volume, we would like to know the magnetic energy
(ECS = (cid:82)
B2
8π dV ) in the CS volume. So the happening
of reconnection can be indicated if the magnetic energy
stored in this volume is less than those injected into it.

An animation for the 3D CS evolution and a horizontal slice is provided, in which the time step is τ /5.

ﬂuctuations of the CS size proﬁle during the whole process,
we ﬁnd that its evolution consists of two phases of distinct
behaviors: in the ﬁrst phase from t = 0 to approximately 30,
it keeps a relatively small value (∼ 200 Mm2); in the second
phase from t = 30 to the end of the simulation, it ﬁrst increases
impulsively and reaches the peak value of 1600 Mm2 at nearly
t = 40, and then decreases rapidly to a value similar to that in
the ﬁrst phase. The evolution of the rate of magnetic energy
injected into the CS, FCS, shows a similar trend. In the later
phase (i.e., from t = 30 to the end), the total magnetic energy
input is about 1033 erg, while the magnetic energy in the CS
volume is smaller by nearly two orders in magnitude and can
be negligible. This indicates that the amount of the magnetic
energy injected into the CS is mostly released via reconnec-
tion (converted into other forms), and the energy release rate
can be approximated by FCS. If we regard the impulsive in-
crease and decrease of the energy release rate in the CS as a
simulated “ﬂare” process, we estimate the released energy by
the ﬂare is about 1033 erg and the energy conversion rate is on
the order of 1029 erg s−1, and can reach an order higher in the

peak time. For a reference, the potential energy of this AR is
approximately 1.5 × 1034 erg during our studied period, over
an order higher than typical-size ARs, e.g., AR 11158 (Sun
et al. 2015). On the other hand, the ﬁrst phase (t = 0 to 30)
can be regarded as a quasi-static evolution duration for which
the time unit τ can be scaled as being one hour, as mentioned
in Section 3. This means that our simulated ﬂare (t = 30) be-
gan 15 hours ahead of the real X3.1 ﬂare (t ∼ 45). However,
for the simulated ﬂare phase, the time duration of nearly 20 τ ,
and thus equaling one hour (since τ = 180 s), is close to the
real one that has relatively long X-ray duration of about one
hour.

The above analysis of the CS evolution based on the mod-
eled results suggests a reasonable picture of how the real ﬂare
was produced: photospheric ﬁeld evolution stressed the coro-
nal ﬁeld and built up a large-scale CS in the core region,
then magnetic reconnection was triggered immediately and
resulted in impulsive release of magnetic energy. As the ki-
netic energy is very low even during the impulsive phase
of energy release, the most of the released magnetic energy

The yellow and white lines are traced from the core site of
the CS (shown by the pink object) and they represent the pre-
reconnection ﬁeld lines. These ﬁeld lines (yellow and white)
are sheared and pass each other at their inner footpoints, while
the CS was formed at the interface between the crossing ﬁeld
lines. These ﬁeld lines later reconnected and changed their
connectivity forming a longer ﬁeld line (blue) connecting the
two outer-most footpoints and a shorter line (cyan) connect-
ing the two inner footpoints. By the magnetic tension force,
both the post-reconnection ﬁeld lines relax. The longer ﬁeld
line expands upward but only slightly, and the shorter line
contracts downward. Further evidence of this type of recon-
nection are the plasma inﬂows and outﬂows associated with
the CS (i.e., diffusive region), horizontal and vertical slices of
which made near the reconnection point are shown, in Fig-
ure 6c and d. Although the reconnection conﬁguration are of
full 3D, shown in the vertical slice they exhibits a typical X-
shaped two-dimensional (2D) reconnection picture. Thus lo-
cally such reconnection can be considered in a 2D framework
with a strong guide ﬁeld (i.e., out-of-the-plane component).

To support the association of the modeled reconnection
conﬁguration with the real ﬂare event, observed signatures of
the ﬂare emission can be compared with the modeled results,
in an indirect way. Among these are the location and shape
of the chromospheric ﬂare ribbons, which are recognized to
be an indicator of the footpoint locations of those magnetic
ﬁeld lines that underwent reconnection (Qiu 2009). This is
mainly due to the non-thermal particles accelerated at the re-
connection site traveling down along these ﬁeld lines toward
the photosphere and colliding with the dense chromosphere
causing enhanced heating (Reid et al. 2012).

As the sampled ﬁeld lines shown in Figure 6 are traced from
the core site of the CS (where J/B is the strongest), they can
be regarded as the “ﬁrst” ﬁeld lines that reconnect in the whole
simulated ﬂare process (however, it is difﬁcult to precisely lo-
cate the ﬁrst reconnection point and ﬁeld lines in the model).
These ﬁrst reconnected ﬁeld lines have four footpoints at the
bottom, and each of them, from left to right as shown in Fig-
ure 6a, roughly corresponding to the four brightening patches
as shown in Figure 7, from left to right, respectively, which
are identiﬁed in AIA 1700 Å channel at the ﬂare beginning.
Both the simulation and the observation show that the two in-
ner ﬂaring points are separated by a relatively large distance
of approximately 50 Mm. The simulation also suggests that
the initial reconnection point is already rather high (∼ 30 Mm)
in the corona.

Following the initial reconnection, the reconnection site
should extends horizontally and forms a line of reconnection
points with similar X-shaped conﬁguration at their vertical
slice. Along the central line of the CS (see the regions with
J/B > 0.3/∆x shown in Figure 6c), we can see the horizon-
tal reconnection inﬂow vectors are almost perpendicular to the
CS. This central line is a hint of such reconnection line. When
all the ﬁeld lines along the reconnection line are involved in,
the two ribbons form (see Figure 8b). To simulate such rib-
bons, we identify all the reconnecting ﬁeld lines as those that
are in contact or pass through the CS (see Figure 9a), which
means that these ﬁeld lines were undergoing reconnection or
formed immediately after reconnection. The footpoints of
these ﬁeld lines, when mapped on the photosphere, appear
to form two curved narrow areas separated by the central PIL
(Figure 8a). A strikingly good match in both the location and
the shape of these simulated footpoint areas with the observed

should be converted into energy of accelerated electrons (ions
also possible), and subsequently in the form of radiation at
various wavelengths. However, our simulation cannot re-
produce this process because we did not include the related
physics in the model. Nevertheless, the modeled results are in
an agreement with the fact that this was a non-eruptive ﬂare,
during which no signiﬁcant disruption of the coronal ﬁeld was
observed.

It is worthy noting that there were small ﬂuctuations, i.e.,
short episodes of relatively small-scale CS formation and dis-
sipation before the major one. These ﬂuctuations reﬂect the
energy build up and might be the simulation counterparts of
the small ﬂares that occurred before the main one (but a one-
to-one correspondence was not reproduced). In fact, it signi-
ﬁes that the magnetic ﬁeld is stressed and from time to time
and the process is interrupted by episodic small-scale recon-
nection. However, preceding to the major ﬂare, the CS is not
large enough for the global-scale reconnection to set in.

current, and by selecting its maximum, we can emphasize the
emission from the reconnecting ﬁeld lines. Finally the total
emission is obtained by integration through the volume along
the line-of-sight (here simply along the z-axis), and forms the
synthetic image. As shown in Figure 9c and d, a good mor-
phological similarity is achieved between the simulated emis-
sion and the AIA-94 images of the hot ﬂaring loops.

As can be seen from the comparison, the ribbons in the
core region correspond to the footpoints of the short ﬁeld lines
there, which reveal themselves as the short contracting loops.
The far southwest ribbon is due to the long ﬁeld lines that con-
nect the negative-polarity sunspot and the far southwest plage
region next to the positive-polarity sunspot, and these long
ﬁeld lines correspond to the long ﬂaring loops. This might ex-
plains why ﬂares frequently involve the brightening of these
long side loops. We note that the shape of long loops appear
not to be very well reproduced. This is possibly because they
are close to the side boundaries of the simulation volume and
thus the modeling of the ﬁeld there is subject to the inﬂuence
of the numerical boundary conditions, especially during such
a long-term computation. A more important factor could be
that our model is based on Cartesian geometry, thus failed to
accurately reproduce the very long loops for which the curva-
ture of the Sun must be considered. Nonetheless, the mapping
of the ﬁeld lines to the bottom surface is still accurate.

chromospheric ﬂare ribbons is evident (Figure 8b and c), in-
cluding even the relatively weak ribbon extending far in the

The ﬂaring loop in the hot channels (e.g., AIA-94) can
also be compared with our simulated ﬁeld (see Figure 9a and
b). For a better vision comparison, we generated a synthetic
EUV image using a method similar to that used by Cheung
& DeRosa (2012). We ﬁrst trace a large number (3 × 105)
of ﬁeld lines from their footpoints uniformly distributed at the
bottom. Then we assign for each ﬁeld line a value of emission
assumed to be J/BJ2 at the peak value point of J/B along the
ﬁeld line. Here J/B can be regarded as the dissipation rate of

ing structures, indicating that these ﬂares were homologous
ﬂares with analogous magnetic mechanism. This might indi-
cate multiple recurrence of the process from slow formation
to fast dissipation of the intensive current layer between the
sheared arcades, while the large-scale conﬁguration of the AR
does not change much.

Analysis of the magnetic decay index (Sun et al. 2015; In-
oue et al. 2016; Jing et al. 2015) seems to explain why the
ﬂare failed to erupt, as the overlying closed magnetic ﬁeld
is sufﬁciently strong to conﬁne the eruption from below (see
another failed eruption shown in Wang et al. 2015). Here
the DARE simulation provides additional and direct expla-
nations. As can be seen from a direct look of the ﬁeld lines
(see Figure 6), the pre-ﬂare magnetic arcades are twisted (or
stressed) by a rather weak extent. A quantitative study of the
magnetic twist has been performed by Inoue et al. (2016) for
the same ﬂare event using a NLFFF model. They found that
the magnetic twists before the ﬂare is mostly less than a half
turn. Consequently, the sheared magnetic arcades do not show
a well-formed two-J shape like those in many sigmoid ARs
with eruptive events. Inoue et al. (2016) also showed that af-
ter the ﬂare, the magnetic twists are almost reserved without
release. This is consistent with our modeled results that the
post-reconnection ﬁeld lines are still sheared arcades, without
forming an escaping magnetic ﬂux rope. In our simulation,
the reconnected long ﬁeld lines on top of the CS only expands
slightly without propagating further to make the overlying ar-
cades open. Thus, in the context of tether-cutting scenario,
only the ﬁrst-stage of tether-cutting occurred, while the sec-
ond stage, formation of a ﬂux rope and reconnection below
the ﬂux rope, did not happen.

Another unusual fact of this ﬂare is that the enhancements
of the horizontal ﬁeld at the photosphere is very weak (Sun
et al. 2015). This is unlike in many other large ﬂares, as an ev-
ident enhancement of photospheric horizontal ﬁeld after ﬂare
is commonly observed (Wang 2006; Wang & Liu 2010; Wang
et al. 2012; Petrie 2012).
In the proposed coronal “implo-
sion” mechanism (Hudson 2000), such enhancement of pho-
tospheric ﬁeld is due to the downward contraction of the short
magnetic arcades formed after the reconnection and their push
on the photosphere. As we found in the simulation here, the
reconnection site is rather high above the photosphere, which
is also suggested by Thalmann et al. (2015) from the study of
the limited variation of the ﬂare-ribbon separations. As a re-
sult, the reconnected short ﬁeld lines below the CS expanded
still rather highly in the corona. So during its contraction, the
effect of its push on the bottom might be reduced signiﬁcantly
by the strong corona ﬁeld below. Thus the large altitude of the
reconnection sites and the long extension of the reconnected
arcades provide a plausible explanation for the weak “implo-
sion” effect. A further quantitative analysis of this effect will
be considered in future works.

It has been found that the magnetic energies from NLFFF
models usually underestimate the related ﬂare energies (e.g.,
Sun et al. 2012; Feng et al. 2013). For the present X3.1 ﬂare,
Sun et al. (2015) gives a result of 0.9×1032 erg from a NLFFF
extrapolation code. As a reference, Thalmann et al. (2015)
estimated that the non-thermal electron energy for an earlier,
conﬁned X1 ﬂare as 1.6 × 1032 erg, so the X3.1 ﬂare energy
is likely to be much larger than this value. On the other hand,
from our simulation we have estimated a total released mag-
netic energy of 1033 erg, which is an order higher than that
derived from the NLFFF model (Sun et al. 2015) and appears

We simulated the magnetic dynamics of AR 12192 in a two-
day period using the DARE model with the SDO/HMI vector
magnetograms as evolving boundary input. Analysis of the
modeled results shows that a large-scale CS is developed in
the AR core ﬁeld due to stressing by photospheric driving, and
then reconnection is triggered within the CS, resulting in an
impulsive release of magnetic energy, which could correspond
to an X3.1 ﬂare occurred near the end of the period. The
reconnection conﬁguration exhibits signatures of the tether-
cutting reconnection (Moore et al. 2001). Comparison with
the AIA observations shows that the model almost reproduced
exactly the location of the chromospheric ﬂare ribbons, and
the morphology of the reconnecting ﬁeld lines and the sim-
ulated EUV image resembles well the ﬂaring coronal loops.
Such an agreement of simulation with observations supports
that our model correctly captured the essentials of the MHD
process of this ﬂare. Observations (Chen et al. 2015) show
that the X-ﬂares in the same AR exhibited very similar ﬂar-

to be sufﬁcient for powering the X3.1 ﬂare. Such an unusually
large value of energy release (compared with typical ARs)
is still reasonable when considering the unusually large size
of this AR with potential energy of about 1.5 × 1034, a order
higher than typical ARs. While the NLFFF model calculates
the drop of total magnetic energy of the whole modeling vol-
ume from pre-ﬂare to post-ﬂare states, we can directly cal-
culate the magnetic energy lost in the CS due to the “recon-
nection” within the CS, which should be more relevant with
the ﬂare-released energy. As such, we did not perform energy
analysis for the full modeling volume.

Recently, Savcheva et al. (2015) claimed that based on MF
or NLFFF models and searching of QSLs, they were able to
predict the locations of the ﬂare ribbon. However, we note
that the QSLs are only possible sites for reconnection, while
they cannot tell where the reconnection occurs speciﬁcally in
a ﬂare. Moreover, by inspecting the map of QSLs, one usually
see much more complex structures than that of target ﬂare rib-
bons (see Figure 5 in Savcheva et al. (2015)). Thus without
knowing ribbon locations in advance, it is still problematic
to identify from all the QSLs the particular ﬂare-related one.

Here with the MHD model we simulated the ﬂare reconnec-
tion process in a self-consistent way and directly identiﬁed
the reconnecting ﬁeld lines, and thus we are able to almost
reproduce precisely the ﬂare ribbon locations.

We ﬁnd that the modeled “ﬂare” began (at t ≈ 30) well
before the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld input at the bottom
boundary evolving to the time of the real ﬂare (at t ≈ 45).
A perfect model of reproducing the reality should produce a
ﬂare at the exact time when the photospheric ﬁeld reaches the
ﬂare onset time. The mismatch of our model with the real-
ity is probably in a large part due to the over-simpliﬁcation
of the magnetic reconnection process, which might be much
more complex since it is related to the microscopic behavior
of plasma. However, as in many other solar MHD codes, the
modeled reconnection here is simply resulted by numerical
viscosity in the CS region, and its behavior depends on the
numerical aspects of the model. For example, the thickness
of the modeled CS and the numerical viscosity are often sen-
sitive to the grid resolution (as well as the speciﬁc numerical
scheme). A much thinner CS can develop if using a smaller
grid size, and the onset of reconnection in the CS might be

postponed. Namely, with a smaller grid size, a CS can sustain
even stronger current and thus even larger gradient of mag-
netic ﬁeld, which might needs more time to form. Further
experiments using different grid resolutions will be required
to quantify this effect.

Comparative study of this ﬂare with eruptive ones may pro-
vide insight in the different magnetic natures of eruptive and
conﬁned ﬂares. Here we refer to our previous study in which
we use the DARE model to simulate an eruption event in
AR 11283 (Jiang et al. 2016). For that event, the eruption on-
set time is matched by the model much better, with less than
a time lag of 2τ during a whole simulated period of 60τ . Un-
like this event, the simulated eruption in AR 11283 is due to
the formation of a jet-like magnetic conﬁguration that favors
breakout-like reconnection (Antiochos et al. 1999). So in that
event, the critical condition causing eruption is the formation
of a reconnection-favorable magnetic topology, which can be
regarded as a macroscopic behavior. Whereas in AR 12192,
cause of its ﬂare depends more on the triggering of the re-
connection rather than the formation of a favorable topology,
since the basic topology is simply a conﬁguration of sheared
arcades and it does not change for days. In other words, the
cause of the ﬂare relies more on the microscopic behavior of
the plasma and thus is more subtle. The MHD model seems
to be able to characterize well the macroscopic structures and
evolutions, while it may not appropriately simulate the micro-
scopic aspects of the plasma, and thus, the triggering of the re-
connection. Such difference might be common and even fun-
damental between eruptive ﬂares and conﬁned ﬂares, in par-
ticular, those events without noticeable changes of the coronal
structures.

Finally, the reconnection-related quantities derived from
the model should be taken with cautions because of the sim-
pliﬁcation of reconnection. A deeper understanding of the

ﬂare dynamics requires knowledge of the true nature of mag-
netic reconnection and is beyond the scope of this paper. In
addition, the quantitative results suffered uncertainties from
several aspects including HMI data and model settings. For
example, the evolution speed of the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld is increased in the model for saving computing time, and
this might affect the coronal evolution, most likely at the time
around the ﬂare.

In summary, the present data-driven simulation study can
provide important insight in understanding why and how so-
lar ﬂares occur, particularly, for those events in which the
dynamic change is elusive in observations. Further advance-
ments, including more realistic plasma model, reconnection
realization and thermodynamics as well as extension to spher-
ical geometry, are necessary for even more sophisticated mod-
eling of real solar ﬂares. With these improvements, the DARE
model will hopefully become a useful tool to the communities
of solar physics and space weather.
