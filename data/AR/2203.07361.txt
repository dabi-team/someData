Abstract

Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) is a process in which neutrinos
scatter on a nucleus which acts as a single particle. Though the total cross section
is large by neutrino standards, CEνNS has long proven diﬃcult to detect, since the
deposited energy into the nucleus is ∼ keV. In 2017, the COHERENT collaboration
announced the detection of CEνNS using a stopped-pion source with CsI detectors,
followed up the detection of CEνNS using an Ar target. The detection of CEνNS
has spawned a ﬂurry of activities in high-energy physics, inspiring new constraints
on beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, and new experimental methods. The
CEνNS process has important implications for not only high-energy physics, but also
astrophysics, nuclear physics, and beyond. This whitepaper discusses the scientiﬁc
importance of CEνNS, highlighting how present experiments such as COHERENT are
informing theory, and also how future experiments will provide a wealth of information
across the aforementioned ﬁelds of physics.

1. Introduction

Neutrinos have proven valuable in elucidating the structure of the Standard Model
(SM) of particle physics. Though the SM provides the framework describing how
neutrinos interact with leptons and quarks through weak interactions, the SM does not
answer fundamental questions about neutrinos. For example, how are neutrino masses
generated? Are neutrinos Dirac or Majorana particles? Neutrinos provide both direct
evidence for physics beyond the SM and a pathway to search for new physics.

Neutrinos have been detected from many terrestrial and astrophysical sources, and
across a large range of energy scales. Nuclear reactors produce neutrinos with (cid:38) MeV
energies, and accelerator sources produce neutrinos with energies (cid:38) GeV. Neutrinos
from astrophysical sources have been detected over an even larger energy range, from
∼ MeV up to PeV. Dating back to the detection of neutrinos from the Sun [1], from
SN 1987A [2, 3], and more recently from a more distant and energetic source [4], each
detection has seemingly opened up a new window into the Universe.

The low-energy MeV-scale has been especially important in elucidating the neu-
trino properties, such as their mass diﬀerences and mixing properties. At these en-
ergies, there is a unique complementarity in studies of neutrinos from terrestrial and
astrophysical sources. Neutrinos from the Sun provide a direct probe of the nuclear

5

burning process in the interior of stars [5], and have been used in combination with
long-baseline reactors [6] to establish the LMA-MSW solution to the Solar neutrino
problem. Atmospheric neutrinos have been used to establish the vacuum-oscillation
solution to the angular dependence of the neutrino ﬂux [7].

At MeV energies, neutrinos have been detected via several distinct interaction chan-
nels. These channels include neutrino-electron elastic scattering (ν+e → ν+e), as well
as neutral and charged current inelastic interactions on nucleons and nuclei [8]. In the
former case, detectors identify the energy in the outgoing electron, whereas in the latter
case detectors identify either an electron produced in a charged current interaction, or
an MeV gamma in the case of inelastic nuclear interactions. In the particular case of
inverse-beta interaction (¯νe + p → e+ + n), both the outgoing positron and neutron may
be detected. In the MeV energy regime, neutrino interactions transition from being
described by point-like interactions with fundamental particles and interactions with
constituent particles with the nucleus.

Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) is a process in which neu-
trinos scatter on a nucleus which acts as a single particle. Within the SM, CEνNS is
fundamentally described by the neutral current interaction of neutrinos and quarks, and
due to the nature of SM couplings it is proportional to the neutron number squared [9].
Though the total cross section is large by neutrino standards, CEνNS has long proven
diﬃcult to detect, since the deposited energy into the nucleus is ∼ keV. In 2017, the
COHERENT collaboration announced the detection of CEνNS using a stopped-pion
source with a CsI[Na] scintillating crystal detector [10]. This was followed up by the
detection of CEνNS with a single-phase liquid argon target [11], and with a larger
exposure of CsI[Na] [12].

The detection of CEνNS has motivated a ﬂurry of theoretical activity in high-energy
physics, inspiring new constraints on beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. It has
motivated the development of larger scale detectors and technology to extend current
detector sensitivity into lower, sub-keV scale energy regimes. The CEνNS process has
important implications for not only high-energy physics, but also astrophysics, nuclear
physics, and beyond.

In addition to providing a new channel for detection of neutrinos, there are many
interesting physics applications of CEνNS-based experiments. One such example is
the search for low-mass, (cid:46) GeV-scale dark matter particles. Since traditional WIMP
direct dark matter detection searches lose sensitivity for WIMPs around a few GeV,
CEνNS-like experiments provide an important method to probe low-mass dark matter.
These experiments are complementary to on-going experiments that are searching for
dark matter at this mass scale. Beyond dark matter, CEνNS-like experiments may be
deployed to study long-sought-after particles such as axions.

The goal of this whitepaper is to highlight the broad theoretical and experimental
implications of the CEνNS process. Section 2 discusses the calculation of the CEνNS
cross section in the SM, including a discussion of nuclear eﬀects. Section 3 discusses
the terrestrial sources that are now being deployed to detect CEνNS, and Section 4
discusses astrophysical MeV neutrino sources. Section 5 discussed the application
for CEνNS to physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on non-standard neutrino
interactions (NSI) and sterile neutrinos. Section 6 reviews the on-going and future ex-
periments around the world that are being utilized to detect CEνNS. Finally, Section 7

6

outlines broader connections to the US neutrino and dark matter physics program.

2. CEνNS in the Standard Model

CEνNS is a neutral-current process that arises when the momentum transfer in the
neutrino-nucleus interaction is less than the inverse of the size of the nucleus. In the
SM, the interaction is mediated by the Z-boson, with its vector component leading to
the coherent enhancement [9]. As reference point, we ﬁrst write the cross section in

with proton number Z, neutron number N, and weak mixing angle sin2 θW . To ﬁrst
approximation, the weak form factor Fw(q2) depends on the nuclear density distribution
of protons and neutrons. In the coherence limit q2 → 0 it is normalized to Fw(0) = 1,
with the coherent enhancement of the cross section reﬂected by the scaling with N2 via
the weak charge, given the accidental suppression of the proton weak charge Qp
w (cid:28) 1
(see Eq. (6) below). Consequently, this implies that CEνNS is mainly sensitive to the
neutron distribution in the nucleus.

In writing the cross section as in Eq. (1) a number of subtleties have been ignored:
subleading kinematic eﬀects, axial-vector contributions, form-factor eﬀects besides the
density distributions, and radiative corrections. In the subsequent sections, some of
these eﬀects are addressed in more detail, see also Refs. [13, 14].

with an axial-vector form factor FA(q2) [13]. This contribution vanishes for nuclei with
even number of protons and neutrons, which have spin-zero ground states.

Moving from the quark-level interactions in Equation (3) to the neutrino-nucleus
cross section in Eq. (5) involves a two-step process [13]. In the ﬁrst step, hadronic
matrix elements are required to obtain the matching to single-nucleon operators, i.e.,
vector and axial-vector form factors of the nucleon, respectively. For the vector op-
erators, the normalization is determined via the valence-quark content, leading to the
relations

while the q-dependent corrections, expressed in terms of radii and magnetic moments,
are subsumed into the weak form factor Fw(q2). Similarly, FA(q2) depends on the axial
charges and radii of the nucleon. In the second step, the nuclear responses need to be
derived from a multipole expansion [15–19], in which the leading contribution can be
interpreted in terms of the proton and neutron density distributions. The relations (6)
hold at tree level in the SM, with radiative corrections discussed in Sec. 2.3.

Instead of writing the CEνNS cross section in terms of the recoil energy, as in
Eq. (1), the cross section may also be expressed in terms of the direction of the re-
coil, converting the recoil to an angular spectrum. In practice, a detector may provide
a measurement of both recoil energy and direction at once, in which case the scatter-
ing rate would be expressed as a function of both variables, d2R/(dΩRdER), where the
angles are those of the scattered nucleus measured with respect to the incident neu-
trino direction. This quantity has been referred to in the literature as the Momentum
Spectrum [20] and as the Directional Recoil Spectrum (DRS) [21]. It can be written as

2.2. Nuclear and hadronic physics

Due to the suppression of the weak charge of the proton, the most important nu-
clear response required for the interpretation of CEνNS experiments is related to the
neutron distribution. While the charge density of nuclei has been probed extensively
in elastic electron scattering experiments [22–25], the neutron density distributions are
hard to determine. Precise experimental data exist for observables that are sensitive to
the neutron density distribution or the neutron skin, such as the nuclear dipole polariz-
ability [26–29], but eﬀorts using hadronic probes require a careful analysis of model-
dependent uncertainties (see, e.g., Ref. [30]). In contrast, electroweak processes such
as parity-violating electron scattering (PVES) [31] and CEνNS have long been consid-
ered as clean probes of the neutron densities. Both of which, though long considered
experimentally challenging, have become a reality in recent years [32–35].

The observation of CEνNS can therefore further provide important nuclear struc-
ture information through the determination of the weak form factor, which constrains
the neutron density distribution and thus the neutron radius and the neutron skin, at
least at low momentum transfers where the process remains coherent [13, 36–46].
These measurements complement PVES experiments not only due to additional data,
but also due to diﬀerent energy ranges and nuclear targets, which could be used to
calibrate nuclear-structure calculations. Furthermore, improved measurements of the
neutron skin would have important consequences for the equation of state of neutron-
rich matter, which plays an essential role in understanding the structure and evolution
of neutron stars [47–51].

However, arguably the most intricate aspect of nuclear-structure input concerns
searches for physics beyond the SM (BSM). Without independent experimental in-
formation for the neutron responses, which, potentially apart from PVES, is diﬃcult
to obtain, CEνNS cross sections provide constraints on the combination of nuclear
responses and BSM eﬀects. In fact, in order to derive BSM constraints beyond the
level at which current nuclear-structure calculations constrain the neutron distribution,
a combined analysis of multiple targets and momentum transfers is required to distin-
guish between nuclear structure and potential BSM contributions. To do so, a detailed
understanding of the nuclear responses is prerequisite.

similar parameterizations are assumed for the neutron form factor. In the Helm ap-
proach [52], the nucleon distribution is given by the convolution of a uniform density
with radius R0 and a Gaussian proﬁle with width s, the surface thickness. The resulting
form factor is

range Yukawa potential with range ak over a hard sphere distribution with radius RA.

(14)

In both cases, it should be stressed that these parameterizations need to assume a value
for the neutron radius—related to R0 or RA—and only try to capture the leading nu-
clear responses, with the neutron distribution largely unconstrained. Actual nuclear-
structure calculations of the nuclear responses are based on relativistic mean-ﬁeld
methods [36, 41], nonrelativistic energy-density functionals [37, 44, 46], shell-model
calculations [13, 54, 55], and, for argon, a ﬁrst-principles calculation using coupled-
cluster theory [40].

Retaining all responses that at least display some degree of coherent enhancement,
the weak form factor receives further contributions, e.g., related to ﬁnite-size eﬀects
and spin-orbit interactions. Further corrections could be expected from two-body cur-
rents, but for the relevant responses such contributions only start at loop level in the
chiral expansion [13]. Figure 1 compares several predictions for argon’s Fw(q2), whose
spread indicates the accuracy with which nuclear responses can currently be calculated.

that separate weak charges need to be deﬁned. For CEνNS, the corresponding radiative

3. Terrestrial sources

In this section we discuss terrestrial neutrino sources that are deployed to detect
CEνNS. In Section 6 below we provide more detailed information on current and forth-
coming experimental eﬀorts that use these sources.

3.1. Stopped-pion beams

Spallation sources produce π+ and π− though proton collisions with nuclei. Most of
the π− that are produced are captured by nuclei, and therefore do not decay to produce
neutrinos. On the other hand, the π+ lose energy and decay at rest, π+ → µ+νµ, to
produce mono-energetic muon neutrinos with energy 30 MeV. From the subsequent
decay of µ+ at rest, ¯νµ and νe are produced with a Michel energy spectrum. Due to
the decay lifetime, ¯νµ and νe from muon decays are delayed relative to the 30 MeV νµ
produced from the prompt pion decay. The spectral functions are given by

3.2. Reactors

Nuclear reactors have long been purposed as copious sources of electron anti-
neutrinos. Neutrinos from reactors have been detected using the inverse beta decay
reaction, ¯νe + p → e+ + n, by observing both the outgoing positron and coincident neu-
tron. There are four isotopes whose ﬁssion produce neutrinos above the inverse beta
decay threshold: 235U, 241P, 239P, and 238U. The neutrino ﬂux is determined from the
power produced by the reactor, with theoretical uncertainties on the reactors ﬂuxes es-
timated in Refs. [61, 62]. The calculated electron anti-neutrino spectrum from reactors
is shown in Figure 3.

The characteristic neutrino energy is (cid:46) 1 MeV, which is nearly an order of magni-
tude less than the neutrinos produced by accelerator sources. Due to these low energies,

regime, so that there is no dependence on the internal structure of the nucleus [63].

3.3. 51Cr

51Cr is an electron-capture decaying isotope with a half-life of 27.7 days. The
neutrino spectrum consists of four monochromatic lines, the most energetic of which
are at 747 keV (81%) and 752 keV (9%). These lines may be exploited for CEνNS [64].

3.4. Geo-neutrinos

Geo-neutrinos emitted from radioactive decays of 238U, 232Th and 40K within Earth
can provide unique insight into its interior, formation and central engine. While the
geo-neutrino ﬂux is suppressed, CEνNS has the potential to explore beyond the 1.8 MeV
kinematic threshold limiting the conventional IBD signal and thus detect the 40K geoneu-
trinos [65].

3.5. Next-generation neutrino beams

The Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) beamline at Fermilab may also be
used to study CEνNS [66]. The LBNF beam neutrinos are produced at a characteristic
energy scale diﬀerent than neutrinos from reactor or SNS sources. This provides an
important new, third energy scale at which the CEνNS cross section can be studied.

Although energetic, the LBNF beamline can induce CEνNS and that the process
can be measured, provided the detector is sensitive to low recoil energies. The low-
energy tail of the neutrino spectrum (on-axis) extends down to energies of order 50
MeV.

4. Astrophysical sources

In this section we discuss neutrinos from astrophysical sources, including the Sun,

supernovae, and the atmosphere, that may be used for CEνNS detection.

4.1. Solar neutrinos

The ﬁeld of Solar neutrinos is over a half-century old. The primary goal of these
solar neutrino experiments is to measure the diﬀerent components of the ﬂux, and use
these measurements to understand the physics of the solar interior. The ﬁrst experi-
ments utilized neutrino capture reactions on Cl, Ga to speciﬁcally study the electron
neutrino component of the neutrino ﬂux [67, 68]. “Real-time” solar neutrino kilo-ton
scale water cherenkov experiments [69–71] measured neutrino-electron elastic scat-
tering, with sensitivity to both electron and muon neutrino ﬂavors. Combining all
experimental data, the ﬂux of the 8B component is 5.25 × 106 cm−2 s−1 [70].

Borexino has measured the low-energy components of the solar neutrino ﬂux, orig-
inating from the reactions p + e− + p (pep), 7Be, p + p (pp), and CNO cycles [71–
75]. The combination of all solar neutrino data with terrestrial experiments favor the
LMA-MSW solution to neutrino ﬂavor transformation from the Sun to the Earth. At
low energies, (cid:46) 5 MeV, vacuum oscillations describe the neutrino ﬂavor transforma-
tion, and the electron neutrino survival probability is (cid:38) 50%. At energies (cid:38) 5 MeV,

13

matter-induced transformations describe the ﬂavor transformation, with a correspond-
ing survival probability of (cid:38) 1/3 [5, 76].

Even with the tremendous theoretical and experimental progress in the ﬁeld of so-
lar neutrinos, there are still some outstanding questions that surround some of the data.
For example, three experiments (Super-Kamiokande, SNO, and Borexino) that are sen-
sitive to electron recoils from neutrino-electron elastic scattering ﬁnd that at electron
recoil energies of a few MeV, the data are ∼ 2σ discrepant relative to the prediction of
the best-ﬁtting LMA-MSA solution. This may be indicative of new physics [77]. In
addition, the recent measurement of the solar mass-squared diﬀerence from solar neu-
trino data, in particular from the day-night Super-Kamiokande data [78], is discrepant
at the ∼ 2σ level relative to that measured by KamLAND [79]. This may be explained
by novel physics in the neutrino sector [80].

Another outstanding question relates to how the measured ﬂux informs the physics
of the solar interior. Modeling of solar absorption spectra and heliosiesmology data
suggests a lower abundance of metals in the solar core, i.e. a low-Z SSM [81]. This
is in comparison to the previously-established high-Z SSM [82]. Though some sets
of solar neutrino data favor a high-Z SSM [73], a global analysis of all solar neutrino
ﬂuxes remains inconclusive [83].

Figure 4 shows the solar neutrino ﬂuxes, with the normalizations of each ﬂux cor-
responding to those from the high-Z SSM. The pp and pep are relatively insensitive to
the assumed solar metallicity model, while the 8B, 7Be, and the CNO components are
much more sensitive to the solar metallicity model. There is a particularly large the-
oretical uncertainty (∼ 15%) on the CNO neutrino ﬂux, which has just recently been
detected by Borexino.

component is shown. For the atmospheric ﬂux, shown is the sum of all ﬂavor components. For the diﬀuse
supernova neutrino ﬂuxes, shown is the sum of all ﬂavor components.

4.2. Supernova neutrinos

The detection twenty neutrinos from 1987A conﬁrmed that core-collapse supernova
explosions carry away 99% of the energy associated with the burst in neutrinos of all
ﬂavors. Neutrinos are expected to emerge from the core of a supernova with a nearly

MeV, respectively [84]. Though neutrino detectors have been operating in the three
decades since SN 1987A, there has yet to be a detection from neutrinos from a Galactic
supernova [85]. The next supernova event in the Milky Way or in nearby galaxies is
expected to provide unprecedented information on the physics of neutrino propagation
from the SN core [86]. For example, large water cherenkov detectors such as Super-
Kamiokande will measure thousands of events, mostly through the charged-current
inverse beta decay channel, and hundreds of events through various other elastic and
inelastic channels [87].

A series of detectors are currently waiting for neutrinos from the next nearby super-
nova (see SNEWS section below). Detectors sensitive to CEνNS will play an important
role in extracting information from supernova neutrinos. Through the CEνNS channel,
and neutrinos ﬂavors will be accessible [36, 88, 89]. For many years, this has been
recognized to provide important information on the nature of stellar collapse [90]. By
measuring the mean neutrino energies, tens of events are likely enough to constrain
the explosion energy of the supernova, and to reconstruct the supernova lightcurve.
This will be possible with currently-operating ton-scale detectors, and with next gener-
ation, multi-ton scale detectors the extracted physics will rival that of more traditional
neutrino detectors [88]. In addition to the well-established technology of Xe-based
time projection chambers, Pb-based cryogenic detectors can oﬀer a great advantage
thanks to their high CEνNS cross-section, and their optimized small experimental vol-
ume. The newly proposed RES-NOVA experiment is aiming at achieving a precision,
in the reconstruction of the main supernova parameters, comparable to the one of the
currently running experiments, while operating a modular cm-scale archaeological Pb-
based cryogenic detector [91]. More-so, CEνNS can be eﬀectively utilized to detect
the pre-SN neutrino ﬂux emitted prior to the SN onset, allowing the detectors to act
as SN alarms and providing information about stellar evolution complimentary to IBD
signal employed in conventional neutrino searches [92].

In addition to the yield from a Galactic supernova event, future dark matter detec-
tors may have sensitivity to the diﬀuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) [93,
94]. The predicted DSNB ﬂux is ∼ 6 cm−2 s−1 [95], including contributions from all
neutrino ﬂavors. Though the DSNB has not been directly detected, there are strong
upper bounds on the ¯νe component of the ﬂux from Super-Kamiokande [96]. The best
predictions for the ﬂux of all ﬂavors implies that dark matter detectors with exposures
∼ 100 ton-year should be sensitive to the DSNB [97, 98]. Analogously to supernova
events and DSNB, CEνNS can probe explosions of supermassive stars and associated
diﬀuse neutrino background [99], which could be be related to the origin of supermas-
sive black holes.

4.3. Atmospheric neutrinos

The collisions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere produce mesons and leptons across
a wide range of energies. These heavy mesons and leptons decay to produce muon and
electron neutrinos and antineutrinos. A precise determination of this atmospheric neu-
trino ﬂux at the surface of the Earth depends on several factors, including the cosmic-
ray ﬂux at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere, the propagation of the cosmic rays through
the atmosphere, and the decay of the mesons and muons as they propagate though the

15

atmosphere. Since the ﬂavors of neutrinos that are produced in the decays are known,
theoretical models accurately predict the ratio of the ﬂavor components of neutrinos
across all energies. However, the normalizations of the ﬂuxes diﬀer depending upon
the theoretical input.

Dating back several decades since their initial detection [100, 101], many experi-
ments have estimated the ﬂux of atmospheric neutrinos over nearly the entire energy
range which they are produced [102–105]. In these experiments, in the most common
detection channel a neutrino interacts with a nucleus in or around the detector, creat-
ing a (cid:38) MeV outgoing lepton (typically a muon) whose direction is reconstructed to
tag a neutrino interaction. Through these types of detection, detailed measurements
of atmospheric neutrinos have not only conﬁrmed the basic prediction of neutrino
production, but also have been important in identifying new physics. For example,
Super-Kamiokande measured the ratio of muon to electron type events, and established
vacuum-induced νµ to ντ transitions as the solution to the zenith angle dependence of
this ratio [7].

While the atmospheric neutrino ﬂux for energies (cid:38) 1 GeV has been well studied by
the aforementioned experiments, the low-energy ﬂux of atmospheric neutrinos, (cid:46) 100
MeV, is diﬃcult to both theoretically model [106] and to measure. Though the energy
spectrum of neutrinos produced corresponds to that of muon and pion decay at rest,
the absolute normalization of the ﬂux is less well constrained due to the uncertainties
that arise from several physical processes. For example, the cosmic ray ﬂux at the top
of the Earth’s atmosphere diﬀers from the cosmic ray ﬂux in the interstellar medium.
One reason for this is because of the solar wind which decelerates cosmic rays that
enter into the heliosphere. A second reason is due to the geomagnetic ﬁeld, which
induces a cut-oﬀ in the low-energy cosmic ray spectrum. Detailed modeling of both
of these eﬀects implies that for energies (cid:46) 100 MeV, the uncertainty on the predicted
atmospheric neutrino ﬂux is approximately 20% [107, 108]. Due in particular to the
cutoﬀ in the rigidity of cosmic rays induced by the Earth’s geomagnetic ﬁeld at low
energies, the atmospheric neutrino ﬂux is larger for detectors that are nearer to the
poles [107, 108].

The atmospheric neutrino ﬂux is nearly isotropic, with small predicted deviations.
Over all energies, the atmospheric neutrino ﬂux peaks near the horizon, at zenith angle
cos θ (cid:39) 0. At high energies, the ﬂux is very nearly symmetric about cos θ (cid:39) 0, as at
these energies the cosmic ray particles are more energetic than the rigidity cutoﬀ. At
low energies, the ﬂux becomes asymmetric, as the ﬂux of downward-going (cos θ = 1)
neutrinos is lower than the ﬂux of upward-going neutrinos (cos θ = −1). There is also
a time variation in the neutrino ﬂux with a period of ∼ 11 years due to the modulation
of the primary proton cosmic-ray spectrum by the Solar wind [108]. This eﬀect is most
prominent for detectors at high latitudes, such as SURF or SNOlab.

The predicted nuclear recoil energy distribution from atmospheric neutrinos using
the CEνNS detection channel is shown in the left panel of Figure 4. The event rates
indicate that a detector exposure of ∼ 20 ton-yr will be required to begin to be sensitive
to atmospheric neutrinos. Because the high energies of the nuclear recoils, the eﬀect of
the nuclear form factor becomes important; in particular variations from the standard
helm form factor have a signiﬁcant impact on the predicted rate. Because the form
factor is sensitive to the neutron distribution in the nucleus, and there are no laboratory

measurements that have been made of this distribution in a nucleus like Xe or Ar, this
form factor will likely remain a signiﬁcant systematic uncertainty in determining the
event rate.

From the kinematic limits we can ﬁnd that a detector sensitive to nuclear recoils
in the energy range ∼ 1 − 50 keV will be sensitive to neutrinos in the energy range
∼ 40 − 60 MeV. More precisely, we can asses the range of energies of atmospheric neu-
trinos a given detector is sensitive to by integrating over ER above a speciﬁed threshold.
The result of this integration as a function of Eν is given in Fig 5, indicating the neu-
trino energy range that a xenon and argon detector with ER (cid:62) 3 keV and ER (cid:62) 25 keV
(respectively) would be sensitive to. For comparison we also show the lowest energy
channel (sub-GeV single-ring electron-like events) that Super-Kamiokande was sensi-
tive to in their atmospheric neutrino analysis [102]. As indicated, Super-Kamiokande
is sensitive to neutrinos (cid:38) 100 MeV for their fully-contained electron-like events.

malized to unity. The electron and muon-ﬂavored ﬂuxes are indicated with the dashed curves, and the solid
black curve is the total atmospheric neutrino ﬂux, summed over all ﬂavors. The features in the neutrino
ﬂuxes result from pion and muon decay at rest. Future dark matter experiments will access an atmospheric
neutrino energy range that is not accessible to Super-K. From Ref. [109]

5. Beyond the Standard Model physics

Using the terrestrial and astrophysical sources discussed above, CEνNS has proven
to be a valuable probe of BSM physics. Two speciﬁc BSM physics scenarios that can
be probed are those that include sterile neutrinos or NSI. This section reviews CEνNS
probes of these topics, highlighting current experimental constraints and those expected
in the future.

New gauge singlet fermions are a minimal extension of the SM. As long as there
are no new symmetries forbidding such a term, gauge and Lorentz invariance allow one
to write down the following term in the Lagrangian

Lsterile ⊃ yNHL,

(18)

where y is a Yukawa coupling, H and L are the Higgs and lepton doublets, while N is
the new gauge singlet fermion, more commonly referred to as a “sterile neutrino” or
“neutral heavy lepton.” Notice that after electroweak symmetry breaking, NHL −→
(cid:104)H(cid:105)Nν, the active neutrinos and the sterile neutrinos mass mix. Thus the existence of
such BSM states can explain the observation of neutrino masses.

Depending on model-dependent details the coupling there may also be a Majorana
mass term for N. Unlike the charged fermions of the SM, there are no good theoretical
arguments (i.e. anomaly cancellation) constraining the number of these sterile neutri-
nos. Moreover, there is no ﬁrm theoretical guidance as to what mass scale to associate
with these states, as reasonable models have been constructed with the sterile neutrinos
ranging from sub-eV to beyond the GUT scale.

Sterile neutrinos as described above can be searched for in a number of experi-
ments. Most searches for sterile neutrinos fall into one of two categories: (1) modiﬁed
oscillations, or (2) direct production. The second category exploits the fact that ster-
ile neutrinos inherit a portion of the weak interaction via their mixing with the active
neutrinos. This allows for their production in meson decays or neutrino scattering, and
typically makes them unstable.

In searching for signatures of sterile neutrinos, experimental data are most easily
interpreted within the two-neutrino picture. This picture approximates that the mass-
splittings between active neutrino ﬂavors is zero, and that the oscillations are driven by
the much larger mass splitting between the active and sterile states. Depending on the
source and the detector, experiments are able to probe neutrino appearance (νµ → νe,
¯νµ → ¯νe), or disappearance (νµ → νµ, ¯νe → ¯νe).

Data from several experiments are consistent with a sterile neutrino interpretation
with a mass splitting (cid:38) 1 eV2. Accelerator appearance experiments LSND [110] and
MiniBooNE [111, 112] have identiﬁed an excess of events in νµ → νe oscillation data.
The radioactive source experiments of the GALLEX and SAGE Solar neutrino detec-
tors have found indications of a deﬁcit of electron neutrinos [113, 114]. Independently,
very short baseline neutrino experiments with distances of < 100 m ﬁnd evidence for
a deﬁcit of electron anti-neutrinos [115], however, more recent re-evaluations of these
experiments with updated antineutrino ﬂux predictions yield no strong preference for
this deﬁcit [116, 117]. There are currently no disappearance experiments utilizing the
νµ → νµ channel that are consistent with a sterile neutrino interpretation, with the ex-
ception of a ∼90% CL preference from IceCube [118]. Summaries of sterile neutrino
searches with joint ﬁts can be found in Refs. [119–121], and global analyses of reac-
tor data are given in Ref. [117, 122]. More recently, the MicroBooNE experiment has
begun searching for anomalous νe appearance in a νµ beam to test this scenario [123–
126]. These results have been reinterpreted in the context of a sterile neutrino search
in Ref. [127], ﬁnding that their null results do not yet rule out the parameter space
preferred by MiniBooNE [128] and LSND.

Figure 6: Constraints on the sterile neutrino mass splitting and mixing angle assuming a 3 year exposure
from COHERENT, with distance baselines of 20 and 40 m. Closed contours show the allowed LSND and
MiniBooNE regions (ﬁgure taken from Ref. [130]).

Because of its sensitivity to the total active neutrino ﬂux, CEνNS experiments are
unique in their capability to search for sterile neutrinos. At a ﬁxed distance baseline,
the signature of sterile neutrinos would be a depletion of the ﬂux relative to that pre-
dicted by the SM. This requires a precise understanding of the systematic uncertainties
on the neutrino ﬂux from the source. Sterile neutrinos may be identiﬁed by compar-
ing the energy spectrum of nuclear recoil events at diﬀerent distance baselines. This
technique is independent of the systematic uncertainties associated with the source ﬂux
normalization, though does require detectors with suﬃcient energy resolution.

CEνNS detectors at stopped-pion sources may be purposed for sterile neutrino
searches. In particular, the sensitivity to sterile neutrinos is maximized when deploy-
ing multiple detectors at diﬀerent distance baselines in the range ∼ 20–40 m [129].
This conﬁguration can probe parameter space that is consistent with the ∼ eV mass-
scale hinted at by LSND and MiniBooNE, thereby providing an independent test of
sterile neutrino parameter space [129, 130]. Figure 6 shows projected constraints for
a stopped-pion experiment, assuming two diﬀerent baselines. This shows that CEνNS
is able to provide a strong independent probe over nearly the entire mass splitting and
mixing regime.

CEνNS detectors deployed with a reactor sources may also be utilized to search
for signatures of sterile neutrinos. As discussed in detail below, several reactor-based
experiments, using baselines anywhere between ∼ 2–20 m, are now being designed to
detect CEνNS. These experiments will provide the capability to test the sterile neutrino
interpretations of existing data sets. In contrast to the case of the stopped-pion source,
reactor-based experiments are only sensitive to the mixing of the electron neutrino with
the sterile state. Finally, CEνNS has been proposed as a new probe of lepton unitarity
and sterile neutrinos [131, 132].

In this section we review the main phenomenological implications derived from the
inclusion of additional operators leading to modiﬁcations of vector- and axial-vector
interactions in the SM with a non-trivial ﬂavor structure, as well as from the addition
of new operators with a diﬀerent Lorentz structure (e.g., scalar or tensor operators). We
also review the phenomenological implications of neutrino electromagnetic properties
in the context of CEνNS.

5.2.1. Non-Standard Interactions: Vector and axial-vector interactions

A convenient way to parameterize possible new physics eﬀects in low-energy ob-
servables is through the addition to the SM Lagrangian of eﬀective higher-dimensional
operators. In the context of neutrino physics, the term Non-Standard Interactions (NSI)
usually refers to the inclusion of four-fermion (d = 6) operators leading to modiﬁca-
tions of the Wilson coeﬃcients already present in the SM [133] (for recent reviews see,
e.g., Refs. [134, 135], or Refs. [13, 136] for the operator basis relevant for CEνNS).
In the context of CEνNS, NSI of interest are those aﬀecting Neutral-Current (NC) pro-
cesses involving quarks and neutrinos, that is:

CEνNS experiments are primarily sensitive to vector NSI (though axial-vector in-

pared to vector interactions for relatively light nuclei). Speciﬁcally, operators in Eq. (20)

where we have assumed real NSI, and radiative corrections for the weak charges of the
proton and the neutron have been included, so they explicitly depend on the neutrino
ﬂavor index (see Sec. 2.3). Note also that the weak form factor changes in presence of
NSI [13].

20

Figure 7: Sensitivity of CEνNS experiments to sin2 θW compared to other SM precision tests (ﬁgure adapted
from Ref. [66]).

From a phenomenological perspective, NSI may show up as a modiﬁcation of the
weak mixing angle that is experimentally measured. As described in Sec. 2, the nor-
malization of the CEνNS cross section depends on the weak charge of the nucleus
(with possible corrections from axial-vector interactions in case the target nucleus car-
ries spin), which in the SM depends on sin2 θW . A possible deviation of the measured
weak charge from its SM value (including the appropriate radiative corrections dis-
cussed in Sec. 2.3) could then be interpreted as a signal from new physics. This has
been made evident in our notation in Eq. (22): new physics models inducing NSI with
protons will directly aﬀect the extraction of sin2 θW . Formulating constraints in terms
of sin2 θW thus deﬁnes a minimal scheme to compare the sensitivity of CEνNS exper-
iments to other SM precision tests, including parity-violating electron scattering and
electroweak precision observables [66, 137–144]. The projected sensitivity is shown
in Fig. 7 for a selected set of CEνNS experiments.

In a more general context, NSI aﬀect the matter potential that neutrinos feel as
they propagate in a medium and therefore may lead to signiﬁcant modiﬁcations of the
neutrino oscillation probabilities. Global ﬁts to oscillation data have been performed
for NSI with quarks [145–147] and set relatively strong bounds on the size of the oﬀ-
diagonal NSI coeﬃcients; however, oscillation experiments are only sensitive to dif-
ferences between the diagonal NSI parameters. Neutrino scattering (and, in particular,
CEνNS), on the other hand, is sensitive to the diagonal NSI parameters individually and
thus provides complementary information to that from oscillations [148]. For recent
works deriving bounds on NSI using current CEνNS data, see, e.g., Refs. [148–156];
for future prospects see, e.g., Refs. [157–161]. Besides improving the overall sensitiv-
ity to NSI parameters, the combination of oscillation and scattering data also disfavors
the LMA-Dark solution [162, 163]. This is relevant for the determination of the neu-
trino mass ordering at current and future oscillation experiments [146, 147, 164, 165],
as discussed in more detail in Ref. [166]. Examples for CEνNS constraints on the NSI
parameters are shown in Fig. 8.

5.2.2. New neutrino interactions in U(1)(cid:48) models

At this point it is worth noting that the interactions included in Eq. (19) are not
gauge invariant. If these operators are obtained from a new theory at high energies,
gauge invariance generically implies the simultaneous generation of similar operators

involving charged leptons, for which tight experimental constraints exist [167, 168].
Unless ﬁned-tuned cancellations are invoked [167], this makes it hard to build a model
that leads to sizable NSI eﬀects in neutrino experiments (either in oscillations or in
CEνNS experiments). A possibility to avoid the tight bounds from charged-lepton
ﬂavor violating observables is to consider that the new physics may be weakly coupled
to the SM, via new mediators with masses well below the EW scale (see the related
discussion in Ref. [166]). A well-motivated example is to extend the SM with an
extra U(1)(cid:48) symmetry, which may serve as a vector portal to the dark sector. The new
mediator associated to this symmetry is usually referred to as a Z(cid:48).

Matching a concrete new physics model onto the EFT at low energies, a dependence
on the mediator mass arises, since the amplitude of CEνNS depends on its propagator.
In this case, the weak charge of the nucleus gets modiﬁed in a similar way as in the
NSI case, simply replacing

where for simplicity we have assumed that the new interaction is lepton-ﬂavor conserv-
ing. Here, c(cid:48)
α refers to the charge of να under the new interaction, while gZ(cid:48) refers to
the new gauge coupling introduced. From this discussion it follows that, for a weakly-
coupled Z(cid:48), bounds from scattering experiments with momentum transfer above the
mediator mass (q2 (cid:29) M2
Z(cid:48) ) will be suppressed since the cross section in this case is
Z(cid:48)/q2. CEνNS measurements become very relevant in this context,
proportional to ∼ g2
since the very low momentum transfers involved allow this process to be sensitive to a
wider set of Z(cid:48) models. Recent works studying bounds on light vector mediators with
current CEνNS data include Refs. [150, 154, 169–179]. Sensitivities at future facilities
have been studied for the European Spallation Source [180] and Los Alamos National
Laboratory [161].

5.2.3. Electromagnetic properties

The fact that neutrinos are massive, as implied by the robust discovery of neu-
trino oscillations, provides the best motivation for the existence of non-trivial neu-

These usually come in the form of a neu-
trino magnetic moment or a neutrino charge radius. If sizable enough, they could in
principle induce detectable distortions of the expected signal at CEνNS experiments.
The diﬀerential cross section in the presence of a neutrino magnetic moment adds
incoherently to the Standard Model cross section due to the required spin-ﬂip, i.e.,

The individual TMMs can be probed in CEνNS measurements and their eﬀect has been
comprehensively studied in Refs. [184, 185].

Reducing the detection threshold is crucial for improving the current sensitivities.
Indeed, reactor-based CEνNS experiments with sub-keV capabilities should oﬀer more
exciting results, complementary to current limits. Very recently, measurements ob-
tained at the Dresden-II reactor experiment [186] have been interpreted in the con-
text of neutrino magnetic moment searches, providing an upper bound on µeﬀ
νe below
O(few) × 10−10µB, depending on the choice of quenching factor and other technical
details of the data analysis [144, 150]. The authors of Refs. [160, 185] have computed
the projected sensitivities at the next generation CEνNS experiments and ﬁnd that they
could compete with the current best upper limits, e.g., from Borexino.

5.2.4. Other NSI

A neutrino dipole moment is only the simplest example of a new class of opera-
tors that can be constructed once a chirality ﬂip is admitted, with further interactions
including [13, 136]

generalizing Eq. (25) and again to be added incoherently to the SM cross section. While
the dipole part is determined by the charge form factor of the nucleus, the scalar op-
erator leads to a new form factor FS (q2) [13]. Finally, a tensor operator induces NSI
similar to the axial-vector contributions, but the required form factors diﬀer due to the
required multipole decomposition [13].

6. Experimental eﬀorts

Many on-going and planned experiments around the world are dedicated to the

detection of CEνNS. This section reviews these experimental eﬀorts.

6.1. Stopped-pion beams

As described in Section 3, stopped-pion sources are a source of νe, νµ, and ¯νµ. The
low-energy neutrinos that are produced, ∼ 10 − 50 MeV, are a source for CEνNS. The

following experiments are either in data-taking mode, or are being planned, at diﬀerent
stopped-pion sites around the world. The general ﬂux-averaged cross section for a
stopped-pion ﬂux is shown in Figure 9.

SNS: The COHERENT collaboration has reported the ﬁrst detection of coherent neutrino-
nucleus elastic scattering (CEνNS) [10]. COHERENT utilizes the Spallation Neu-
trino Source (SNS) with a stopped-pion beam, which produces a well-known neutrino
spectrum from pion and muon decay at rest. Muon neutrinos, νµ, arrive from prompt
charged pion decay, while ¯νµ and νe are produced from the delayed muon decay. With
an exposure of 14.6-308 kg-days, the COHERENT collaboration identiﬁed nuclear re-
coil events from CEνNS which is well in excess of the expected background events for
this exposure.

There are many important results that can be extracted from the COHERENT mea-
surements. Using both timing and energy data, the ﬂavor components of the ﬂux can
be measured. Present estimates of the electron and muon ﬂavor components are shown
in Figure 10. It is expected that future data sets will be able to fully separate the ﬂavor
components.

The COHERENT results have provided the ﬁrst measurement of the neutron dis-
tribution in CsI [38, 45, 141]. The RMS measurement of the neutron radius is Rn =
5.0 ± 0.7 fm, assuming the Helm parametrization of the form factor. The measurement
of the neutron skin is Rn − Rp = 0.2 ± 0.7 fm, which is in agreement with the theoretical
nuclear model predictions (see e.g. Fig. 4 in Ref. [45]).

Lujan: The Lujan Center’s tungsten spallation target can be a proliﬁc source of neu-
trinos from decays of stopped pions and muons created by an 800 MeV proton beam

at Los Alamos National Laboratory. A 10 ton liquid argon scintillation detector or
Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) detector is built to study neutrino’s coherent elas-
tic scattering with argon nuclei. A ton-scale mass and a keV-range energy threshold
may allow the CCM detector to possess leading sensitivity to potential low-mass dark-
matter signals.

ESS: The European Spallation Source (ESS) will soon provide the most intense neu-
tron beams for multi-disciplinary science. It will also generate the largest pulsed neu-
trino ﬂux suitable for the detection of CEνNS [160].

JSNS2: The Japan Spallation Neutron Source of J-PARC is featured by an 1 MW
beam of 3 GeV protons incident on a mercury target, creating an intense neutrino ﬂux
from the stopped-pion and stopped-muon decays. The JSNS2 (J-PARC Sterile Neu-
trino Search at J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source) experiment aims to search for the
existence of neutrino oscillations and to oﬀer the ultimate test of the LSND anomaly
at a 17-ton ﬁducial volume Gd-dopped liquid scintillation detector [188]. A new de-
tector is being planned to study not only CEνNS but potential low-mass dark-matter
signals [189].

The current theme of reactor experiments is on the observation of neutrino-nucleus
elastic scattering at the kinematic regime where complete quantum-mechanical co-
herency is expected [190]. The following experiments are either in data-taking mode,
or are being planned, at diﬀerent reactors sites around the world.

project is an experimental eﬀort to develop a xenon-doped argon ionization detector
that can enjoy the beneﬁts of both argon and xenon [191]. Thanks to the relatively
small atomic mass, an argon atom can pick up more kinetic energy from neutrino
scatters than heavier elements can, and by doping it with xenon – which has lower
excitation/ionization energy and faster scintillation than argon does – the detector can
be more eﬃcient in producing ionization electrons from CEνNS interactions and also
generate detectable light signals with long wavelength and fast decays. Combining an
argon target with a xenon detector-like performance, CHILLAX aims to develop the
ideal large-mass noble liquid CEνNS detector. With an expected energy threshold of
200-300eV, CHILLAX may detect a few times less CEνNS interaction signal per kilo-
gram than what is possible in eV-threshold detectors, but thanks to the scalability of
the noble liquid technology CHILLAX can easily achieve an active mass of tens of
kilogram and be a leading competitor in rate-oriented CEνNS applications. CHILLAX
is currently focusing on developing the ﬁrst generation prototype detector. Once the
xenon-doping beneﬁts and low-energy sensitivity are experimentally demonstrated, we
plan to build a ∼50kg detector to deploy either at the SNS (for BSM physics studies)
or near a reactor (for sterile neutrino search and reactor monitoring demonstrations).

CONNIE: The Coherent Neutrino-Nucleus Interaction Experiment (CONNIE) uses
low-noise fully depleted charge-coupled devices (CCDs) with the goal of measuring
low-energy recoils from CEνNS of reactor antineutrinos with silicon nuclei [192]. The
CCD detectors can operate at a nuclear recoil threshold of approximately 30 eV, where
the conversion from electron equivalent to silicon recoil energy is given by the so-
called quenching factor, from which measurements at low energies (≈ 0.7 keV) and
new theoretical approaches are used [193–195].

CONNIE has reported results from its analysis with a detector array of 8 CCDs
with a ﬁducial mass of 36.2 g, and a total exposure of 2.2 kg-days. In an analysis of the
diﬀerence between the reactor-on and reactor-oﬀ spectra, no excess events are found at
low energies, yielding upper limits at 95% conﬁdence level on the CEνNS rate. In the
lowest-energy range analyzed by CONNIE, 50 − 180 eV, the expected limit is 34 (39)
times the standard model prediction, depending on whether the Sarkis or the Chavarria
quenching factor is assumed. The CEνNS limits from CONNIE are shown in Figure 11.
In addition, the upper bound from the previous analysis [192] in the lowest-energy
bin was used to impose competitive constraints on the parameter space of some NSI
models. CONNIE used two simpliﬁed extensions of the Standard Model with light me-
diators and obtained new world-leading constraints [177] for vector mediator masses
MZ(cid:48) < 10 MeV and scalar mediator masses Mφ < 30 MeV. These results were quoted
as a community milestone, being the ﬁrst competitive BSM constraint from CEνNS at
reactors.

In the next planned upgrade, CONNIE aims to lower the detection threshold, de-
crease the readout noise and increase the eﬃciency by upgrading the experiment with
the recently demonstrated skipper-CCD sensor. The experiment is currently commis-
sioning running with two skipper CCDs and optimising the data acquisition and analy-
sis strategy. Studies show that skipper CCDs allow to lower the detection threshold to
about 10 eV, increasing the neutrino rate about 6 times at the current experiment posi-

tion. With the preliminary background rate measurement of 4 kdru, if the experiment
is upgraded to 100 g mass, it could detect CEνNS in about three months. The possibili-
ties to reduce the background rate and increase the neutrino ﬂux are being studied if the
detector is moved inside the reactor dome, which would greatly improve its sensitivity.

CONUS: The CONUS (COherent elastic Neutrino nUcleus Scattering) experiment em-
ploys four 1 kg low energy threshold high-purity point-contact Germanium detectors to
look for CEνNS. The experiment is located at the commercial nuclear power plant of
Brokdorf, Germany, in a distance of 17.1 m from the reactor core with a maximum
thermal power of 3.9 GW. With the electrically cooled spectrometers an energy resolu-
tion of 150-160eV (ionization energy, full width at half maximum ionization energy)
at the 10.4 keV K-shell X-ray of 71Ge/68Ge is achieved [197]. The energy threshold
is ≤1.875 keV for nuclear recoils. With the onion-like shield consisting of layers of
lead, borated polyethylene and a muon anti-coincidence veto a background level of
∼10 counts/kg/d below 1 keV ionization energy is achieved at reactor site [198]. With
the data collected in 2018 and 2019 an upper limit on CEνNS was derived in depen-
dence of the quenching factor (ratio between detected ionization energy and recoil
energy) in germanium [199]. For a quenching factor of k=0.16, this corresponds to a
limit of 0.34 kgd−1 at 90% conﬁdence level (factor 17 above the standard model predic-
tion). From the same data, limits on various BSM models [176] as well as the neutrino
magnetic moment (from neutrino electron scattering) [200] were evaluated. With the
data collected afterwards signiﬁcant improvements on these limits are expected. The
quenching factor for germanium at low recoil energies is not well known and large
discrepancies between the existing measurements persist. Recently, the CONUS col-
laboration carried out an own quenching measurement [201] to signiﬁcantly reduce
this major systematic uncertainty. The ﬁnal data collection run started in 2021 with
several upgrades enhancing the sensitivity for a CEνNS detection. Signiﬁcant improve-
ments on the stability of the environment parameters were achieved. For the ﬁrst time
pulse shape information are collected as well with the intent to discriminate signals

28

from background. The nuclear power plant shut down permanently at the beginning of
2022, which provides the opportunity to reduce the statistical uncertainty and improve
the background understanding.

Dresden: The experiment consists of a low-noise 3 kg p-type point contact germa-
nium detector which has been installed and operated at the Dresden-II power reactor,
near Chicago, at about 10 meters from its 2.96 GWth core [202]. The detector are
enclosed by a compact shielding made of several layers of active vetos and passive
shielding material. The results from an upgraded setup are interpreted to have a prefer-
ence for a CEνNS component in the data, when being compared to a background only
model [186].

MINER: The Mitchell Institute Neutrino Experiment at Reactor (MIνER) experiment
was launched to use cryogenic germanium and silicon detectors with a low nuclear
recoil energy thresholds to register nuclear recoils of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering (CEνNS) at a TRIGA research nuclear reactor at the Texas A&M Univer-
sity [203]. This reactor has a movable core (1 m to 10 m) that will allow precision
studies of very short baseline neutrino oscillation by comparing rates as a function
of distance and largely eliminating reactor ﬂux uncertainties. Close proximity of the
detector to the reactor core, combined with multiple low threshold detectors with event-
by-event discrimination between the dominant electromagnetic background and the nu-
clear recoil signal provides sensitivity to BSM physics, sterile neutrinos that oscillate
away on a few-meter scale, and above all a highly sensitive probe for applied reactor
monitoring for safeguards and non-proliferation. Planned deployment of the MINνER
experimental set up at the South Texas Project (3 GW) power reactor will provide sig-
niﬁcant further improvement in measurement sensitivity.

NEON: The Neutrino Elastic-scattering Observation on NaI(Tl) (NEON) experiment
uses high-light yield NaI(Tl) crystals to observe the CEνNS events at a distance of
24 m from the core of the Hanbit nuclear reactor in Korea. Commercial reactors pro-
duce a large number of anti-neutrinos with a thermal power of 2.8 GW, and the on-
going NEOS sterile neutrino program [204] provides a systematic understanding of the
environment. This experiment utilized the previous experiences of the NaI(Tl) crys-
tal detectors for the COSINE-100 dark matter search experiments [205, 206]. The
NaI(Tl) detector used in the COSINE-100 experiments showed a light yield of 15-
photoelectrons/keV [207], and a multivariate machine larning technique was used to
eﬀectively remove the noise event caused by PMT to reach a low energy threshold of
1 keV [208]. Preliminary studies to lower the energy threshold achieved 0.5 keV en-
ergy event access with 80% selection eﬃciency and 25% noise contamination level.
This can be improved by adopting deep machine learning algorithm currently in de-
velopment. In addition, we developed a novel encapsulation method of the NaI(Tl)
crystals with improved light collection eﬃciency up to 22 photoelectrons/keV [209].
Energy thresholds of less than 0.3 keV can be achieved with these detectors. The ﬁrst
phase NEON experiment (NEON-pilot) was built with a 2 × 3 array of 6 detectors with
a total mass of 15 kg using the commercial quality crystals while the next phase exper-
iment (NEON-1) may use up to 100 kg of the low-background NaI(Tl) crystals [210].

29

The NEON-pilot crystals were immersed in an 800-L liquid scintillator. It was shielded
with 10-cm-thick leads and 30-cm-thick polyethylene. The shields and DAQ systems
closely follows the COSINE-100 dark matter experiment [207, 211]. The NEON-pilot
experiment is currently being commissioned on the ground site and is expected to be
installed at the reactor site by the end of 2020. We plan to take 1 year of reactor-
on data with 5 months of oﬀ data expecting the observability of the CEνNS process
with a signiﬁcance of more than 3σ and will upgrade it to NEON-1 for more than 5σ
observation.

NUCLEUS: The NUCLEUS experiment aims for a detection of CEνNS using CaWO4
cryogenic calorimeters with nuclear recoil thresholds around 20 eV. This unique feature
demonstrated in an early prototype [212–214] will allow observation of the majority of
tungsten recoils induced by reactor antineutrinos by accessing unprecedentedly low en-
ergies, taking full advantage of the coherent cross-section boost. The ﬁrst experimental
phase will deploy a 10 g cryogenic target [215] composed of approximately 6 g CaWO4
and 4 g Al2O3 in a new experimental location [216] at the Chooz nuclear power plant in
France. The two target materials feature widely diﬀerent CEνNS cross-sections but a
comparable neutron response, useful for in-situ measurement of potentially dangerous
nuclear-recoil backgrounds.
The experimental setup will consist of a dry dilution refrigerator, a compact passive
shielding made of neutron moderators and lead, active muon [217] and gamma antico-
incidence veto detectors as well as an integrated LED-based calibration system. The
setup is under construction for commissioning in Munich in 2022 before deployment
at the reactor site planned from 2023 on.

nuGen: The nuGEN experiment aims at the detection of CEνNS with low-background,
low-threshold HPGe detectors installed at a distance of ∼ 10 m to one of the 3.1 GWth
reactors at the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) in Russia. The detectors are sur-
rounded by a compact passive shielding and an active muon veto, which are installed
on a movable platform to modify the distance to the reactor core. nuGEN has been
installed on-site in 2019 and preliminary data from ﬁrst science runs have been pre-
sented [218].

NUXE: The NUXE experiment will use a liquid xenon detector to observe reactor neu-
trino CEνNS events down to single ionization electron signals [219]. The experiment
is currently under development at UC San Diego with a 30-kg liquid xenon target in an
electron counting chamber (ECC). Major eﬀort is reducing the background down to the
single electrons, corresponding to a nuclear recoil energy threshold of ∼300 eV [220].

PALEOCCENE: The PALEOCCENE concept [221, 222] aims to exploit the crystal de-
fects caused by nuclear recoil by using an optical readout scheme based on the imaging
of individual color centers. The resulting detectors would be room-temperature, pas-
sive devices with recoil thresholds close to the threshold damage energy of the detector
material of 100 eV or less. The project is in the early stages of R&D.

Ricochet: The Ricochet neutrino experiment aims to measure neutrinos produced from
nuclear reactors by using cryogenic bolometers to identify the signature nuclear recoil

30

from CEνNS [223]. In order to overcome the high level of electromagnetic background
present at low energies, Ricochet will make use of particle identiﬁcation in order to
discriminate between electron and nuclear recoils.

The future Ricochet experiment will be deployed at the ILL-H7 site in Grenoble,
France. The H7 site starts at about 8 m from the ILL reactor core that provides a nom-
inal nuclear power of 58.3 MW, leading to a neutrino ﬂux at the Ricochet detectors
8.8 m from the reactor core of about 1.2×1012 cm−2s−1. The reactor is operated in cy-
cles of typically 50 days duration with reactor-oﬀ periods suﬃciently long to measure
reactor-independent backgrounds, such as internal radioactivity or cosmogenic induced
backgrounds with high statistics. It is located below a water channel providing about
15 m water equivalent (m.w.e.) against cosmic radiation. It is not fed by a neutron
beam and is well-shielded against irradiation from the reactor and neighboring instru-
ments (IN20 and D19). The site is well-characterized in terms of backgrounds, and
the operation of the STEREO neutrino experiment at this site has been successfully
demonstrated [224].

The experiment will make use of two detector technologies/targets. The CryoCube
will consist of an array of 27 (3×3×3) high purity germanium crystal detectors, encap-
sulated in a radio-pure infrared-tight copper box suspended below a lead shield inside
the crysotat [225]. Each detector mass is about 38 g to reach a total target mass around
one kilogram. A low-energy threshold is desired as the discovery potential scales ex-
ponentially with lowering the energy threshold. Considering a 50 eV energy threshold,
about 12.8 evts/kg/day of CEνNS interactions is expected in the CryoCube detector
array. To reach such threshold, the CryoCube detectors will be equipped with germa-
nium neutron transmutation doped sensors (NTD). To achieve particle identiﬁcation,
the detectors will have a double heat and ionization readout. Ionization measurement
is realized thanks to aluminum electrodes allowing to apply an electric ﬁeld and col-
lect signals from the ionization electron-hole pairs drifting across the crystal. With an
anticipated particle identiﬁcation threshold of about 100 eV, thanks to the combination
of a 10 eV and 20 eVee (electron-equivalent) heat and ionization baseline resolutions
(RMS), the CryoCube detector array should lead to a CEνNS detection signiﬁcance
after one ILL reactor cycle (50-days) between 4.3–17.3 σ, depending on the ﬁnal back-
ground level achieved.

Q-Array – the complimentary detector array within Ricochet – will consist of 9
cubes of superconducting zinc cubes, each with a mass of about 35 g, as its target. Us-
ing superconductors as the primary detector is a novel technology which is expected to
provide detection sensitivity theoretically down to the Cooper pair binding energy. The
expected discrimination mechanism begins with the diﬀerent eﬃciency of quasiparti-
cle (QP) production (breaking Cooper pairs) by electron recoils (higher QP production)
vs. nuclear recoils (lower QP production). The initial phonon production from the re-
coil is followed by a slower phonon production as QPs relax to the ground state. The
relative ratio between initial phonons and QP-induced phonons thereby gives rise to
a usefully discriminating pulse shape. Transition edge sensors (TES) will be used for
the readout of the phonon signals from these superconducting bolometers. Initial pro-
totype TES chips with a transition temperature of 80 mK were developed by Argonne
National Laboratory for this use. Using results from these sensors, a second version
was designed and fabricated, with a transition temperature of ∼20 mK. These devices

31

are under testing [226] and a signiﬁcant decrease in sensor threshold is expected.

The background level at the ILL site is expected to be high, due to the proximity
to the nuclear reactor core (≈8 meters), the neighboring experiments emitting large
amounts of gammas and neutrons (IN20 and D19). Despite the presence of the ≈15
m.w.e. artiﬁcial overburden provided by the water transfer channel of the reactor di-
rectly above the experiment, the site remains exposed to cosmic radiation. As we
expect to observe about 12.8 CEνNS events/kg/day, a highly eﬃcient background mit-
igation strategy is mandatory. As a result, Ricochet aims for an electronic recoil back-
ground at the level of 100 events/day/keV/kg. Such an electronic background level
should be eﬃciently rejected thanks to our detectors’ particle identiﬁcation capabili-
ties. However, as such discrimination doesn’t hold for neutron induced nuclear recoil,
the latter are expected to be our ultimate background. We are therefore aiming for a
nuclear recoil background level around 5 events/kg/day to ensure a favorable CEνNS
signal to noise ratio.

Ricochet is currently scheduled to see “ﬁrst light” in 2023.

RED-100: RED-100 is a two-phase xenon emission detector built to observe the co-
herent elastic scattering of reactor electron antineutrinos oﬀ xenon atomic nuclei [227].
The mass of the detector medium is 160 kg in the sensitive volume, and about 100 kg
in the ﬁducial volume — the largest value among detectors developed for CEνNS ob-
servations at reactors. The capability of detector full-scale operation in the background
conditions caused by cosmic radiation has been demonstrated in a ground-level labo-
ratory [228]. The detector was deployed at the Kalinin NPP in 2021 at 19 m distance
under the 3 GW reactor core (50 m.w.e. overburden) and acquired both reactor on and
oﬀ data in January and February of 2022 with an energy threshold of about 1 keVnr.

SBC: The SBC (Scintillating Bubble Chamber) Collaboration is developing novel
liquid-argon bubble chambers for GeV-scale dark matter and CEνNS physics [229].
The ﬁrst detector, SBC-Fermilab, with 10-kg active mass, is currently under construc-
tion for characterization and calibration in the NuMI tunnel at Fermilab, aiming to
reach a threshold for nuclear recoils of 100 eV. The detector consists of a quartz jar
ﬁlled with superheated liquid argon, which is spiked with ppm levels of xenon acting
as a wavelength shifter. Cameras are used to image bubbles, silicon photo-multipliers
detect scintillation, and piezo-acoustic sensors listen for bubble formation. A duplicate
detector constructed with low-background components, SBC-SNOLAB, will follow
for a search for 0.7–7 GeV dark matter.

Following this initial program, a deployment of one of these detectors after ∼2024
at a nuclear reactor could make a high signal-to-background measurement of reactor
neutrino CEνNS. Sensitivity to the weak mixing angle, neutrino magnetic moment,
and a Z’ gauge boson mediator have been calculated for deployments at both a 1 MW
research reactor and a 2 GW power reactor [230]. Background characterizations are
ongoing at the 1 MW TRIGA Mark III research reactor located at the National Institute
for Nuclear Research (ININ) near Mexico City for a potential ﬁrst reactor deployment
3 m from the core.

TEXONO: The TEXONO collaboration has been studying neutrino physics with sub-
keV germanium detectors at the Kuo-Sheng Reactor Neutrino Laboratory (KSNL) in

32

Taiwan [231]. There is a national policy of de-commissioning nuclear power in Taiwan,
and the Kuo-Sheng Reactor will be phased out by 2023. As a result, there are no plans
on expansion or new projects to the KSNL program. The collaboration would seek to
continue the studies via collaboration with other existing reactor laboratories.

Data taking and R and D program are conducted with electro-cooled (EC) point-
contact germanium detectors (PCGe). As of summer 2020, detector mass up to 1.43 kg
are built and threshold as low as 200 eV ee is achieved. The data would also bring im-
proved sensitivities to the searches on various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics
channels, such as neutrino magnetic moments [232] and milli-charged neutrinos [233].
Active theory program is being pursued in parallel, with focuses on atomic corrections
to νN (and χN for dark matter) cross-sections [233], as well as BSM searches.

NEWSG: NEWS-G is a direct dark matter detection experiment, sensitive to light Dark
Matter (DM) between 0.1 and 10 GeV/c2. NEWS-G uses a spherical gaseous detec-
tor, the Spherical Proportional Counter (SPC) [234]. The detector is composed of a
spherical shell made of radio-pure copper, acting as the cathode, and a read-out sen-
sor at the center with either a single anode [235] or multiple anodes [236, 237]. The
detector is versatile and can operate with a wide variety of gas mixtures. Use of light
elements, such as H, He, C, and Ne, is ideal for light DM searches thanks to the kine-
matic match between target and projectile, and the favorable ionization quenching fac-
tor compared to heavier elements. The SPC exhibits several features, such as: simple,
few component build; very low energy threshold (single ionization electron level) in-
dependent of detector size [238]; and ﬁducialization and event discrimination through
pulse shape analysis. These make it an invaluable tool for searches requiring detection
of low-energy recoils. The ﬁrst NEWS-G results were published in 2017 [239] with
a 60 cm diameter SPC installed at LSM [239], producing the most stringent limits for
DM masses below 600 MeV/c2 at that time. Currently (2020), the advanced 140 cm
diameter SPC [240, 241] is being installed at SNOLAB following a commissioning
phase at LSM in 2019.

The SPC’s features that make it ideal for light DM searches make it also appealing
for the detection of neutrinos through CEνNS. The study of CEνNS with a sub-keV
energy threshold detector, like the SPC, allows for a rich physics program and opens
a window to physics beyond the Standard Model that will appear as deviations from
the expected recoil spectra predicted by SM interactions [242]. For example, the mea-
surement of a non-zero neutrino magnetic moment [243, 244] and the search for sterile
neutrinos. The use of SPC for CEνNS detection can lead to several applications re-
lated to nuclear reactors, such as monitoring reactor neutrino ﬂuxes, probing the reac-
tor fuel to control plutonium production and the study of reactor anti-neutrino energy
spectrum, which is not well understood below the Q-value of the inverse beta decay
process. Practically, taking into account the detector energy threshold (50 eVee) and
the SPC size (60 cm), Ar and Ne are the strongest candidates to be used as targets,
with event rates of 15 and 11 events/kg/day/GW respectively, however, this does not
exclude the use of other gas mixtures for speciﬁcation applications.

NEWS-G plans to construct a 60 cm diameter sphere made of ultra-pure copper
for CEνNS studies. The detector will be encased in a shielding inspired from the
GIOVE [245] and CONUS [246] experiments. A muon veto will complete the shield-

33

ing apparatus. The experimental setup will be installed at Queen’s University, Kingston,
Canada, to assess the environmental and cosmogenic backgrounds and to establish if
any alterations are required for operations in the proximity of a reactor. The construc-
tion of the shield will start in fall 2020 and commissioning at Queen’s University is
expected to take place by summer 2021. The background studies will be conducted
through 2021 and 2022, while a reactor site is identiﬁed. One year of data taking is
planned after the installation of the detector at a reactor site.

6.3. Dark matter & CEνNS detectors

As described above, neutrinos from the astrophysical sources like the Sun and su-
pernovae as well as from the atmospheric cosmic-ray-showers produce nuclear recoils
via CEνNS, leading to signals in future dark matter detectors. The eventual presence
of an unshieldable background in multiton-scale dark matter detectors has been an-
ticipated for some time [97, 247–252], and is thought to present a major obstacle for
improving the sensitivity of these experiments. The central problem is that for many
of the most commonly sought-after dark matter models produce nuclear recoil signals
that look remarkably similar to the CEνNS recoil energy spectra generated by natural
neutrino sources. Due to the ﬁnite systematic uncertainty on the ﬂuxes of those sources
eventually a feeble-enough DM signal could disappear under the expected variation in
the neutrino event rate, and because its signal would not be distinct enough from the
background no positive identiﬁcation of dark matter would be possible. Naively this
implies that there is a “ﬂoor” to the sensitivity of direct detection experiments [253].

Since the dark matter and CEνNS signals are not exactly identical— it is not im-
possible to search for dark matter in the presence of a CEνNS background, but it does
entail signiﬁcant reduction in experiment’s sensitivity. This observation has been called
“neutrino fog” [254]. One approach for visualising the nature of this fog is shown in the
left-hand panel of Fig. 12, where the color displayed encodes the “opacity” of the neu-
trino fog in diﬀerent parts of the spin-independent DM-nucleon cross section parameter
space. One can appreciate here that major sources of neutrino that need to be under-
stood better to aid the search for dark matter are 7Be, 8B and atmospheric neutrinos, as
the height of this fog in cross section is crucially dependent on the size of the systematic
uncertainty on those ﬂuxes [255]. Neutrino ﬂoor considerations play an important role
when considering the feasibility of future experiments, as decreased sensitivity to DM
signals in vicinity of neutrino background also hinder the increase in experimental sen-
sitivity with scaling in detector exposure (e.g. [252, 256]). There are several approaches
for circumventing the neutrino ﬂoor if an experiment can access additional information
to further discriminate the dark matter signal and neutrino background, including the
use of annual modulation [257], target complementarity [252, 255, 258, 259], and di-
rectionality [260–267]. It should also be emphasized that any additional uncertainties
in the neutrino signals [268–272] beyond the systematic uncertainties on the ﬂux will
raise the height of the neutrino fog. Since the signals of diﬀerent types of dark matter-
nucleus interactions do not identically align with the CEνNS signal, depending on the
scenario the neutrino fog could be much lower, or absent entirely [252, 256, 273–275].
For example, inelastic dark matter scattering that could be naturally associated with
models of multi-component dark sectors could help lift the signal degeneracy of the
neutrino ﬂoor [252].

34

Many upcoming experiments will be sensitive to CEνNS and are expected to enter
the neutrino fog, such as XENONnT [276], LZ [277] and DARWIN [278, 279]. Here
we discuss the several experiments that will be sensitive to CEνNS in the forthcoming
years.

XENON: The XENON1T experiment operated a dual-phase time projection chamber
(TPC) ﬁlled with 3.2 tonnes of ultra-pure liquid xenon (LXe). The TPC contained 2.0
tonnes of LXe that is sensitive to ionization electrons (S2) and scintillation photons (S1)
produced by interactions therein. In a ﬁducial volume with 1.0 tonnes of LXe, a back-
ground level down to (76 ± 2) events/(tonne × year × keV) has been achieved. A WIMP
dark matter search lasted from December 2017 to February 2018. Using this data,
the XENON collaboration has performed a ﬁrst sensitive search for solar 8B neutrinos
through nuclear recoils from the CEνNS process [280]. 8B CEνNS leads to an aver-
age nuclear recoil energy of ∼ 1 keV, requiring unprecedented low energy thresholds in
identifying scintillation and ionization signals. In this analysis, the threshold in ioniza-
tion and scintillation signals was lowered down to 4 electrons and 2 photon-electrons,
respectively. With an exposure of 0.6 tonne×year, the expected CEνNS signal is 2.1
events with a background expectation of 5.4 events, dominated by the accidental pileup
of isolated-S1 and isolated-S2 signals. The mean discovery power of 8B CEνNS is 2 σ,
limited by the exposure of this experiment. No signiﬁcant excess from 8B CEνNS is
found in XENON1T. The data is used to constraint new physics beyond the standard
model, such as WIMPs and non-standard neutrino interactions, as well as the response
of LXe to low energy nuclear recoils. The new world leading WIMPs sensitivity is
shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12: Left: The neutrino “fog” for a xenon direct DM experiment (adapted from Ref. [254]). The
opacity of the neutrino fog, i.e. how much the CEνNS signal impedes DM discovery, is encoded by the value
of n shown by the colorbar. This is the exponent with which a DM discovery limit scales with exposure i.e.
σ ∝ (MT )−1/n, so n < 2 in an approximately background-free regime, n = 2 under standard Poissonian
background subtraction, and n > 2 when there is saturation of the signal by the background. The level of
severity of this background saturation varies with the DM mass and cross section, the ﬂuxes of each neutrino
source, and the uncertainty on those ﬂuxes. The relevant source for each part of the parameter space is
labelled. Right: 8B solar neutrino ﬂux limit from XENON1T, for an exposure of 0.6 tonne×year [280].

The XENONnT experiment is currently operating at the Gran Sasso underground

surface area, the accidental coincidence (AC) background will be the biggest challenge
for the discovery of 8B CEνNS. The AC background modeling and discrimination tech-
niques used in the XENON1T analysis will be further developed to improve the sen-
sitivity of XENONnT to 8B CEνNS. The novel cryogenic liquid circulation system
developed to ensure eﬃcient puriﬁcation in XENONnT will mitigate the reduction of
S2s due to impurities, improving the acceptance of low-energy NRs from 8B neutrinos.
Additionally, the data will be analyzed in a trigger-less mode to minimize eﬃciency
loss and to better understand the AC background. Together with the signiﬁcantly larger
exposure, these techniques give XENONnT a strong potential to discover 8B CEνNS.

LUX-ZEPLIN: LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) is a dual-phase xenon TPC with a 7-tonne ac-
tive mass located 1 mile underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility
(SURF) in Lead, South Dakota. The LZ detector was designed to search for interac-
tions of particle dark matter in the mass range from 1 GeV/c2 to 10 TeV/c2. Because
the CEνNS process can produce low-energy nuclear recoil signals similar to those pro-
duced by low-mass WIMPs, LZ will also be sensitive to astrophysical sources of neu-
trinos such as solar 8B neutrinos and atmospheric neutrinos. Over the full 15.34 tonne-
year exposure, LZ is expected to observe 0.65 events from atmospheric neutrinos and
36 events from 8B neutrino in its WIMP search campaigns [277]. A positive detection
of 8B CEνNS signals will be an unambiguous conﬁrmation of LZ’s low-mass WIMP
sensitivity. As the CEνNS mechanism is insensitive to neutrino ﬂavors, LZ’s measured
ﬂux provides a data point complementary to large solar neutrino experiments that rely
on charge-current interactions.

The observable rate of 8B CEνNS in LZ depends strongly on the detector energy
threshold. LZ relies on the detection of scintillation and ionization signals produced by
particle interactions in the active liquid volume. Scintillation in the liquid produces a
prompt signal (S1), and the ionization electrons produce a delayed electroluminescence
response (S2) in a thin gas region above the liquid. For nuclear recoils with the energy
of 1 keV, only ∼ 3 photons and ∼ 6 electrons are produced on average with the nominal
LZ drift ﬁeld of ∼ 200 V/cm[220]. With a photon detection eﬃciency of ∼ 0.1, the
observable 8B CEνNS event rate can increase by a factor of ∼ 5 when the S1 signal
requirement is relaxed from 3 PMT coincidence to 2. However, as we relax the detector
thresholds, the rate of instrumental backgrounds will also rise as a result of phony S1s
(ex. PMT dark count coincidence) and spurious S2s (ex. grid electron emission).
Such backgrounds could obscure us from observing 8B neutrino clearly. Experimental
techniques that can lower the threshold while mitigating background are being actively
explored.

In addition, LZ is capable of detecting supernova neutrinos within our Milky Way,
which occurs at a rate of 1-3 per century. The burst of SN neutrinos, typically with
kinetic energy of O(10 MeV), can produce a stream of CEνNS interactions in liquid
xenon within seconds. LZ’s DAQ system was designed to keep a high up-time to
measure the total energy released, and can generate a real-time trigger as a part of
Supernova Neutrino Early Warning System (SNEWS) to the astrophysics community.

DARWIN: DARWIN (DARk matter WImp search with liquid xenoN) is a proposed

36

next-generation dark matter experiment that will operate 50 t (40 t active) of xenon in
a cylindrical time projection chamber with 2.6 m in diameter and height [279]. The
TPC will be placed in a double-walled cryostat vessel surrounded by neutron and
muon vetoes. While DARWIN’s primary goal is to observe particle dark matter in
the ∼1 GeV-100 TeV mass range, it will also be able to measure the solar 8B neutrino
ﬂux, as well as atmospheric and supernovae neutrinos via CEνNS. The expected 8B
neutrino rate is ∼90 events/(t yr) [278, 281], depending on the achieved energy thresh-
old. The measurement of the atmospheric neutrino ﬂux requires a large exposure of
about 700 t yr [109]. A DARWIN-like detector would be able to observe astrophys-
ical neutrinos of all ﬂavours from core-collapse [88], as well as failed core-collapse
and thermonuclear runaway fusion [282] supernovae. Typically, about 100 events are
expected from a core-collapse supernova at a distance of 10 kpc and a 27 M(cid:12) progeni-
tor mass [88]. The detection of neutrinos from failed core-collapse supernovae would
deliver the time when the proto-neutron star collapses into a black hole [282] and, in
conjunction with the detection of gravitational waves, would identify the progenitor of
a failed supernova. Finally, a large xenon detector such as DARWIN would dramat-
ically improve the sensitivity to the diﬀuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB)
in the νx channel, where νx ⊂ (νµ, ντ.¯νµ, ¯ντ) [98]. While there are strong upper lim-
its on the ¯νe ﬂux from Super-Kamiokande, of 2.7 cm−2s−1, the limits on νx are about
three orders of magnitude weaker. DARWIN would be able to reach a sensitivity of
∼10 cm−2s−1 per ﬂavour. While this is not suﬃcient for a detection, such a constraint
would exclude many DSNB scenarios with new astrophysics or physics [98].

SuperCDMS SNOLAB: SuperCDMS SNOLAB is a dark matter search focused on the
0.5–5 GeV mass range [283, 284]. It will use two kinds of cryogenic solid-state de-
tectors. The ﬁrst type, iZIP detectors, will have the capacity to discriminate nuclear
recoils from electron recoils via measurement of athermal phonons and ionization pro-
duction down to 1–2 keV recoil energy. The second type, HV detectors, will use a high
drift ﬁeld to transduce the charge signal into athermal phonons, provide a recoil energy
threshold about 10× lower, though without the ability to discriminate nuclear recoils.
These thresholds should enable the detection of 8B neutrino CEνNS in a solid-state
detector for the ﬁrst time, albeit with low statistics. The experiment is currently under
construction at SNOLAB and anticipates beginning to acquire data in late 2023.

Going forward, the SuperCDMS Collaboration anticipates extending its scientiﬁc
reach for dark matter with the SNOLAB facility primarily through detector improve-
ments that will provide access to much lower energy recoils [284].
(Modest back-
ground upgrades will also be implemented.) This work will provide suﬃciently low
threshold to detect CEνNS of solar neutrinos from the CNO, pep, 7Be, and even pp
reaction chains, going well past the 8B neutrinos detectable in SuperCDMS SNOLAB.
In particular, with the 0.5 eV threshold anticipated for 25-gram Si detectors operated
with phonon-only readout at 0V bias (i.e., neither iZIP nor HV, and smaller in mass
than the kg-scale SuperCDMS SNOLAB detectors), the rate of solar neutrino events
will be roughly 0.01/kg-day. With anticipated exposures of 12–240 kg-yr, there will be
the potential to detect tens to hundreds of pp chain CEνNS events. These events will
compete with a background of coherent photonuclear scattering, which can be modeled
well based on measurements of Compton scattering at high energies, and with environ-

37

mental backgrounds such as vibrations, RF noise, infrared and blackbody radiation,
etc., which will be explored and better understood during SuperCDMS SNOLAB.

RES-NOVA: RES-NOVA is a newly proposed experiment for the detection of neu-
trinos from astrophysical sources [89]. RES-NOVA will employ an array of archaeo-
logical Pb-based cryogenic detectors sensitive to SN neutrino emission from the entire
Milky Way Galaxy. Its modular design will be suited for the detection of nearby SN
explosions (<3 kpc) [91].

SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS): SNEWS is an international network of
neutrino detectors in operation since 1998, with the aim of providing high-conﬁdence
alerts of nearby core-collapse supernovae by requiring a temporal coincidence of neu-
trino bursts between detectors [285]. Participating facilities include not only large
water-based detectors such as Super-Kamiokande and IceCube, but also scintillator-
based detectors such as KamLAND and lead-based neutrino detection such as HALO.
Alerts are automated, rapid, and do not require human intervention. SNEWS 2.0 is
an ongoing upgrade of the SNEWS system for the multi-messenger astronomy era
[286]: false alarms are acceptable, low probability events should be reported, and
SNEWS will be one of many multi-messenger alert systems. Among the major up-
grades, SNEWS 2.0 will provide pointing information obtained via triangulation, pro-
vide a pre-collapse alert obtained via pre-supernova neutrino detection, and add large-
volume dark matter detectors to the suite of growing detectors connected to the net-
work. Among other beneﬁts, dark matter detectors observe ﬂavor-blind CEνNS events,
which can help disentangle supernova neutrino oscillation eﬀects when combined with
existing inelastic interaction channels.

Paleo detectors: Paleo-detectors use the nuclear damage tracks recorded in natural
minerals over geological time-scales to detect weakly-interacting particles over expo-
sures much larger than what is feasible in conventional terrestrial detectors [287, 288].
Unlike conventional experiments which measure nuclear recoils in real time, paleo-
detectors measure the number of events integrated over the age of the mineral, reaching
up to a billion years for minerals routinely found on Earth. The sources of the keV-
scale nuclear recoils which can be recovered as tracks is rich, including atmospheric
neutrinos [289], solar neutrinos [290], supernova neutrinos [291], as well as dark mat-
ter [292, 293]. Low-energy neutrino and dark matter tracks are initiated dominantly via
CEνNS (quasi-elastic charged-current interactions are more applicable for high-energy
neutrinos).

CYGNUS: CYGNUS is a proposed modular and multi-site network of large-scale gas
time projection chambers [265]. The primary goal of the CYGNUS experiment is to
perform a direction-dependent search for dark matter, which has been shown to be one
of the only ways to convincingly prove the galactic origin of a detected signal [262,
266]. Directionality is also the best means of circumventing the neutrino fog [260,
261], but requires that good performance can be achieved at the sub-10-keV nuclear
recoil energies where the majority of CEνNS events coming from solar neutrinos would
lie.

38

The CYGNUS collaboration was formed from several smaller groups who have
successfully run smaller-scale gas TPCs, similar to the modules that would eventually
make up a larger coordinated experiment. An initial feasibility study was performed in
Ref. [265], which outlined some of the major challenges involved in building a cost-
eﬀective experiment with the sensitivity to both dark matter and neutrinos. The bal-
ancing act is in optimizing the detector have both a large enough target mass to reach
the neutrino fog—preferring large readout planes and high gas densities—while also
maintaining good-enough directionality at low energies to probe through the neutrino
fog—which tends to prefer the opposite. Maximizing directional performance is cru-
cial not just to enable good discrimination between dark matter and neutrino recoils,
but also for discriminating nuclear recoil tracks from electron tracks, which ultimately
sets the threshold. A nuclear recoil threshold of 8 keV has already been shown to be
feasible in the 755:5 He:SF6 atmospheric pressure gas mixture suggested by Ref. [265].
This could be lowered to 3–5 keV with further gas/readout optimisation, and the de-
velopment of specialized track-ﬁtting techniques to improve particle identiﬁcation at
low energies. This would enable a CYGNUS-1000 m3 detector to see between 30–50
CEνNS events over a few years. CYGNUS-1000 would also be able to detect SN neu-
trinos from explosions within ∼3 kpc. Thanks to the directional sensitivity, CYGNUS
may be able to point back to those SN as well [265], something that would be impos-
sible in other dark matter detectors.

The current plans are for the individual groups involved in CYGNUS to move to-
wards 1 m3-scale prototypes to explore several R&D directions, both in terms of gas
optimization, but also to test the highly segmented charge readouts that will be re-
quired.
If a high-deﬁnition prototype can demonstrate good performance, this will
pave the way for a full 10 m3 CYGNUS module on a 5–10 year timescale. A mod-
ular conﬁguration is a key feature of the envisioned design, not just to avoid issues
of available space underground, but more crucially because of the fact that its dimen-
sion along the drift direction has to be kept small to limit diﬀusion. If successful, a
10 m3 TPC could in principle be placed close to a neutrino source for a dedicated
direction-sensitive CEνNS experiment, but in the next few years the primary plans for
the collaboration will be to determine how best to scale this up to a much larger ex-
periment. Eventually a 1000 m3-scale experiment would consist of multiple modules
within some common shielding, and distributed across the various sites involved in the
CYGNUS project including LNGS, SUPL, Kamioka and Boulby.

DRIFT: The goal of the Directional Recoil Identiﬁcation From Tracks (DRIFT) col-
laboration was the detection of a directional signal from Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle (WIMP), halo, dark matter [294]. In order to accomplish this goal a unique,
low-pressure, Negative Ion Time Projection Chamber (NITPC) technology was de-
veloped. The negative-ion drift allowed DRIFT NITPCs to have the lowest energy
threshold and best inherent directional sensitivity of any limit-setting, directional dark
matter detector. In addition, all of DRIFT’s recent limits have been background-free.
As a consequence, DRIFT’s sensitivity to dark matter is almost 1,000 times better than
other directional WIMP detectors [295].

With its unique directional and background rejection capabilities, the DRIFT NITPC
technology is ideally suited to search for nuclear recoils in beam dump experiments.

39

Previous work involved searching for light dark matter recoils behind an electron beam-
dump at JLab. Preliminary work, including a test run at SLAC, suggests that a Beam
Dump experiment using a DRIFT detector, BDX-DRIFT, would have sensitivity rival-
ing the best limits on light dark matter and provide an unequivocal directional signature
in the event of discovery [296]. Placing a BDX-DRIFT detector behind a proton beam
dump, such as in the DUNE Near Detector Complex, is perhaps even more interesting.
The Near Detector Complex is ∼ 100 m underground. The beam timing structure
at the NuMI beam is such that backgrounds are expected to be reduced to negligible
levels. Proton beam-dumps produce a plethora of neutrinos, particularly the LBNF-
Dune beam, which is optimized for neutrino production. Thus, in addition to tradi-
tional beam-dump searches for light dark matter we can also search for beyond the
standard model (BSM) neutrino interactions. We estimate that a 1 m3 νBDX-DRIFT
detector run for one year in the DUNE Near Detector Complex would detect several co-
herent neutrino-nucleus elastic scatters, potentially conﬁrming recent Coherent Elastic
Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEνNS) detection results, but with minimal background.
Oﬀ-axis and directional sensitivity will provide νBDX-DRIFT signatures to search for
physics even in the presence of a neutrino background and opening up a new window
to search for BSM physics.

In the near term a 1 m3 νBDX-DRIFT detector is available to be deployed in the
NuMI beam at Fermilab on a year or two timescale. Knowledge gained from those
runs will inform proposed a proposed experiment in DUNE in the future [66].

BULLKID is a R&D project on cryogenic detectors for CEνNS and light Dark Mat-
ter [297]. By exploiting the high multiplexing levels of kinetic inductance detectors,
goal of BULLKID is to create a monolithic and highly-segmented array of silicon tar-
gets with energy threshold on nuclear recoils around 100 eV and total mass of 30-60 g.
In future experiments several arrays would be produced and stacked to obtain target
masses exceeding 1 kg.

7. Connection with U.S. neutrino and dark matter programs

This whitepaper has focused on the detection of CEνNS, and the physics that may
be extracted from these detections, using both terrestrial and astrophysical sources.
The emphasis is on the multi-faceted experimental eﬀort on-going around the world
to expand upon the recent COHERENT measurements and to study CEνNS using a
wide variety of neutrino sources and detector technologies. Given the broad scientiﬁc
applications of CEνNS, and its complementarity to many diﬀerent aspects neutrino
physics, it will be an important component of the neutrino physics program in the
coming decade.

More generally, CEνNS experiments have broad overlap with the larger neutrino
and dark matter physics programs. It has long been realized that detectors searching
for WIMP dark matter are ideal CEνNS experiments via the detection of astrophysical
neutrinos. There is also overlap between CEνNS experiments and searches for dark
matter in the sub-GeV mass regime. In this context, the CEνNS represents a back-
ground to a possible dark matter signal, and therefore a precision measurement of the
cross section is required.

40

We are now just in the beginning of a very exciting time in CEνNS research. The
potential to reach for new physics, or to approach questions from diﬀerent angles and
will diﬀerent probes, will be a driving force in this ﬁeld for many years to come.
