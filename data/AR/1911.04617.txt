Abstract

We evaluate the eﬀect of boundary layer losses on two-dimensional H2/O2/Ar

cellular detonations obtained in narrow channels. The experiments provide

the details of the cellular structure and the detonation speed deﬁcits from

the ideal CJ speed. We model the eﬀect of the boundary layer losses by

incorporating the ﬂow divergence in the third dimension due to the negative

boundary layer displacement thickness, modeled using Mirels’ theory. The

cellular structures obtained numerically with the resulting quasi-2D formula-

tion of the reactive Euler equations with two-step chain-branching chemistry

are found in excellent agreement with experiment, both in terms of cell dy-

namics and velocity deﬁcits, provided the boundary layer constant of Mirels

is modiﬁed by a factor of 2. A signiﬁcant increase in the cell size is found

with increasing velocity deﬁcit. This is found to be very well captured by the

induction zone increase in slower detonations due to the lower temperatures

in the induction zone.

Detonation cellular structure, Modelling of wall losses

1. Introduction

Detonation structures in narrow channels are usually observed to exhibit

a two-dimensional (2D) structure (e.g., see Refs. [1–3]). Nevertheless, they

tend to propagate with large velocity deﬁcits due to losses originating from

the side walls [4, 5]. The cell sizes are also reported to be much larger in

narrower channels, due presumably to increased reaction zone lengths [6–8],

and the propagation limits (i.e., the critical initial pressures, below which

detonations fail to propagate) are impacted as well (e.g., see Refs. [9–12]).

Previous works focused on modelling the wall losses of detonations in

1D [13–17]. One approach, introduced by Zel’dovich [13], was to model

the wall losses with volume-averaged friction and heat loss terms. Another,

due to Fay [14], accounted for the negative displacement thickness of the

boundary layer, whose eﬀect appeared as a source term of mass ﬂow sink

in the governing equations for the inviscid core (i.e., the undisturbed free

stream ﬂow). Despite these eﬀorts in modelling 1D detonations, in a realistic

way, the eﬀect of these wall losses on the dynamics of 2D cellular detonations

in narrow channels remains unknown.

On the other hand, the recent works of Tsuboi et al.

[18], Chinnayya

et al.

[19], and Sow et al.

[20] have showed that directly resolving the vis-

cous boundary layers by the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations requires remark-

ably high resolution, which makes the computations considerably expensive.

Moreover, for these NS calculations, the other diﬃculty lies in quantifying

2

the wall loss eﬀects on detonation cellular structures.

In the present study, we adapt Mirels’ technique [21] by accounting for

the wall-boundary-layer-induced loss in a 2D formulation of the problem.

This permits us to readily compute the dynamics of unsteady 2D cellular

detonations with a supplemental lateral loss.

The communication ﬁrst reports experiments in a narrow channel, with

variation of the channel width (w) and cell size (λ) ratios, i.e., w/λ. We then

formulate the governing equations with a lateral loss, which is evaluated from

Mirels’ boundary layer theory [21]. Comparisons between experiments and

simulations follow. Finally, eﬀects of the boundary layer losses on dynamics

of the unsteady 2D cellular detonations are explored.

2. Experiments in a Narrow Channel

2.1. Experimental details

The experiments were performed in a 3.4-m-long thin rectangular alu-

minium channel with an internal height and width of 203 mm and 19 mm,

respectively, as described in detail elsewhere [2]. The shock tube comprises

three parts, i.e., the detonation initiation section, the propagation section,

and the test section (about 1.0 m in length). The mixture was ignited in the

ﬁrst section by a high voltage igniter, and mesh wires were inserted in this

part for promoting the detonation formation. The detonation evolution pro-

cess was visualized in the test section, and its mean propagation speed over

the whole test part was obtained by one 113B24 and ﬁve 113B27 piezoelectric

PCB pressure sensors using the time-of-arrival method. The presently inves-

tigated mixture is the very regular stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen diluted

3

with 70% argon (i.e., 2H2/O2/7Ar). Since the mixture of 2H2/O2/7Ar has

low reactive sensitivity, a more reactive driver gas of stoichiometric ethylene-

oxygen (i.e., C2H4/3O2) was used in the initiation section, which was sep-

arated from the propagation section with a diaphragm. For visualization,

a Z-type schlieren setup [2] was utilized with a light source of 360 W. The

resolution of the high-speed camera was 384 × 288 px2 with the framing rate

of 77481 fps (about 12.9 µs for each interval).

2.2. Results

Figure 1 shows the schlieren photos of the detonation reaction zone struc-

tures, at varied initial pressures ranging from 10.3 kPa to 3.1 kPa. By de-

creasing the initial pressure for reducing the kinetic sensitivity of the mixture,

detonations can be clearly observed to propagate with considerably enlarged

cellular structures, with the velocity deﬁcits increased up to 20% ∼ 30% of

the ideal CJ detonation speed. At a relatively high initial pressure in Fig.

1a, where w/λ is about 0.5, one can observe possible 3D-like eﬀects of the

overall detonation structure by the presence of duplicate features that do

not overlap in the schlieren image. This adds to the diﬃculty in studying its

dynamics under the present resolution. With the decrease of w/λ to about

0.25 in Fig. 1b, the detonation structure is qualitatively similar. The ap-

pearance of double Mach stems sharing the same triple point indicates that

detonation is still relatively unstable in this condition. When w/λ is further

reduced to less than 0.1, as shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. 1d, detonations be-

come perfectly planar and essentially two-dimensional for the investigation.

At these low initial pressures, detonations are organized with relatively large

unburned induction zones, as can be observed behind both the leading shock

illustrating the evolution process).

and the transverse wave. The vortex structures characteristic of the Kelvin-

Helmholtz instability can also be readily seen along the slip line from Fig. 1d.

Since the single-head detonation in Fig. 1d experiences a much larger velocity

deﬁcit, being more expensive in CFD calculations, we will adopt the condi-

tion of Fig. 1c as the main benchmark for subsequent model development

and validation of simulations.

Numerical Simulations

3.1. Unsteady quasi-2D formulation

Although the viscous eﬀects are responsible for the boundary layer losses

of detonations in thin channels, the present work aims at modelling these

eﬀects into the inviscid core ﬂow as a source term. For such transient inviscid

reactive core ﬂow behind detonations in a narrow channel, the area-averaged

equations of motion across the z-direction (i.e., the channel width direction

into/out of the page when viewing Fig. 1) can be expressed in the lab frame

of reference (x, y, t) as

change. Of noteworthy is that one can ﬁnd the formal derivation of the 1D

version by Chesser [22].

For an observer travelling in the frame of reference attached to the leading

shock at average speed Ds and following the motion of the ﬂuid, we have the

source term in Eq. 1 further expressed as

where A (x, t) = H × W (x, t) is the eﬀective cross section area. H is the

ﬁxed channel height of 203 mm in this communication, while W (x, t) is the

eﬀective channel width in the z-direction. Since the channel height H is much

larger than the width w (i.e., H/w ≈ 10) in the present work, the boundary

layer eﬀects in the channel height direction are negligible as compared to

those from the channel width direction. x(cid:48), t(cid:48), and u(cid:48) are, respectively, the

space and time coordinates and the post-shock ﬂow velocity in the shock-

attached frame of reference. Since the motion is pseudo-steady (travelling

wave with perturbation), we can neglect ∂

∂t(cid:48) (lnA) to the leading order. We

thus get

which can be evaluated from Fay’s boundary layer theory [14] by using Mirels’

compressible laminar boundary layer solutions [21]. The boundary layer

where x(cid:48) is the distance from the shock, ρ0 the density of the ﬂow ahead of

the shock, µs the post-shock dynamic viscosity, and KM the Mirels’ constant.

One can refer to the recent work of Xiao and Radulescu [3] for details in eval-

uating KM for hydrogen-oxygen-argon detonations at varied initial pressures.

For 2H2/O2/7Ar detonations, they found that KM ≈ 4.0 [3]. Using this rela-

tion, the boundary layer displacement thickness δ∗ in the experiment of Fig.

1c was calculated to be 1.9 mm, with Ds = 0.8DCJ and x(cid:48) as the hydrody-

namic thickness xH between the leading shock and the sonic surface. Note

that xH was computed from the generalized ZND model with lateral losses

[3, 23]. Clearly, the boundary layer is much thinner than the channel width.

Since W (x(cid:48)) = w + 2δ∗ (x(cid:48)), where w is the physical channel width of 19

mm, we can thus obtain

Since Mirels’ model assumes that the post-shock state is uniform and steady,

to the leading order, we can thus write x(cid:48) as x(cid:48) = u(cid:48) (t − ts), where ts is the

time at which the particle crosses the shock. With the mass conservation

across the shock ρsu(cid:48) = ρ0Ds, where ρs is the post-shock density, Eq. 6 can

be greatly simpliﬁed as the following simple expression

3.2. Two-step chemistry model

In the experiment of Fig. 1c, we have calculated the post-shock temper-

atures using the experimentally measured shock speeds along the walls and

cell axis. We found that the lowest post-shock temperature is about 900 K,

which is still above its cross-over temperature of 800 K to 850 K. Thus, in this

study, the two-step chain-branching reaction model [24, 25] will be employed

for describing the chemical kinetics. It consists of two components, i.e., a

thermally neutral induction zone followed by an exothermic main reaction

zone. The transport equations of the induction and reaction variables can

be written as:

sensitivity of the induction zone duration, ν is the reaction order, while α

and β are further empirical reaction order parameters.

Table 1 shows the non-dimensional parameters for the two-step model

at three diﬀerent initial pressures from experiments in Fig. 1. They were

calibrated from the detailed chemistry using the San Diego chemical reac-

tion mechanism (Williams) [26], by using Shepherd’s Shock and Detonation

Toolbox (SDToolbox) [27]. γ was the post-shock isentropic exponent of the

CJ detonation, while the heat release Q was determined from the perfect

gas relation recovering the correct Mach number [28]. The eﬀective activa-

tion energy Ea was calculated from the logarithmic derivative of the ignition

delay with respect to the inverse of post-shock temperature. Note that the

present work adopts the initial state variables (p0, ρ0, T0) and the ZND induc-

tion zone length (∆i) as the normalization scales. As such, the rate constant

ki can be directly obtained from Eq. (9a) by scaling the dimensionless in-

duction zone length to unity, while kr can be determined by recovering the

correct induction/reaction time ratio from the detailed chemistry. Finally,

α = 1.2, β = 1.0, ν = 1.6 were adopted for matching the detailed chemistry

ZND structure, as can be easily seen from the density and temperature pro-

ﬁles in Fig. 2. For the minor discrepancies observed near the end of the

reaction zone, it is due to the limitation of assuming the constant speciﬁc

heats in the present work.

3.3. Computational details

The non-dimensional governing equations were solved employing the M G

code, developed by S. Falle of the University of Leeds, which uses a second-

order-accurate exact Godunov solver [29] with adaptive mesh reﬁnement.

The computational domain height was held constant at the same height of

experiments (203 mm in height), i.e., 72∆i for p0 = 4.1 kPa, 116∆i for

3000∆i to 5000∆i. The detonation propagated from left to the right, with

reﬂective boundary conditions imposed to the top and bottom sides, and

zero-gradient boundary conditions applied to the left and right ends. The

computations were started using a ZND proﬁle placed 300∆i in length from

the left boundary. An initial density disturbance zone of 4∆i was added

ahead of the initial ZND solution for accelerating the evolution to cellu-

lar detonations. This density perturbation method is the same as that of

Maxwell et al. [30], which is give by

where n is a random real number from 0 to 1. As for the numerical resolu-

tion, 5 levels of mesh reﬁnement were adopted with the coarsest and ﬁnest

grid sizes of 1/2∆i and 1/16∆i, respectively. Since the reaction zone length

of the simulated cases in this work is in the order of 100∆i to 1000∆i, as

demonstrated in Fig. 2, such resolution is adequate for obtaining reliable

results. This has been veriﬁed by a resolution test using a higher level of

mesh reﬁnement for calculating the CJ detonation without loss, at the initial

pressure of 4.1 kPa. We found that the ﬁnal stable cell size does not change.

In simulations, we ran all the cases for long enough time until we have ob-

tained at least 10 repeated stable cycles of the detonation structures. Due to

the large domain size, each case running with 100 to 200 cores in parallel in

Cedar of Compute Canada requires about one week to complete. More than

12

20 cases were involved in this study.

3.4. Results and discussion

3.4.1. Comparison with experiments

Figure 3 shows the numerically tracked maximum energy release rates

for detonations with diﬀerent losses, at the initial pressure of 4.1 kPa. This

corresponds to the open shutter photograph in experiments. From the simu-

lated results, it can be observed that the detonation cell size becomes larger

as a result of increasing the Mirels’ constant KM , i.e., increasing the mag-

nitude of boundary layer losses. As the ideal CJ detonation (KM = 0) has

four stable cells across the channel height, it can only accommodate a single-

head detonation for KM = 2.0. When KM is further increased to 2.5, the

single-head detonation ﬁnally failed, as can be seen from Fig. 3e. Accord-

ing to the calculations performed by Xiao and Radulescu [3], the theoretical

Mirels’ constant for 2H2/O2/7Ar detonations is supposed to be KM ≈ 4.0.

However, the present simulations show that KM = 1.75 can very well recover

the experiment (in Fig. 1c) in terms of the cell size and the velocity deﬁcit.

This also occurs for cases at other initial pressures of 6.9 kPa and 10.3 kPa,

respectively, as shown in Fig. 4. While KM = 4.0 results in a larger cell

size and velocity deﬁcit, KM ≈ 2.5 appears to be able to correctly recover

them, when compared to the experiments from Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b. Such

discrepancy from the theoretically computed KM presumably originates from

Mirels’ assumption of the uniform and steady state behind the shock. For

detonations, signiﬁcant gradients of pressure, temperature, and velocity ex-

ist. Particularly, the ﬂow acceleration (in the shock-attached reference) from

being subsonic behind the detonation front to sonic in the reaction zone can

contribute to thinned boundary layers, as already noted by Chinnayya et

al. [19]. In their 2D viscous simulations, they also found that the thickness

of the computed boundary layers behind detonations is approximately half

of that predicted by the uniform steady boundary layer theory. Moreover,

the theoretical calculations of KM assume the leading shock of the ideal CJ

detonation speed, while the 2D simulations have detonations of signiﬁcant

velocity deﬁcits. Thus, it results in a smaller KM than expected by theory.

Future work should be devoted to reﬁne the model to account for these non-

idealities. Nevertheless, it is quite satisfying that the model works within a

factor of 2, which can also be absorbed by uncertainties in chemical kinetics

[31].

Besides the velocity deﬁcit and cell size, the experimentally visualized

qualitative features of the detonation structure, as well as its cellular dy-

namics can be very well reproduced by the simulations, as shown in Fig. 5.

Figure 6 also shows the quantitative agreement in temporal velocity evolution

at a single cell, when compared to experiments. This suggests the robust-

ness of the proposed quasi-2D formulation as well as the two-step chemistry

model in simulating the real detonations in experiments.

3.4.2. Dynamics of detonations with diﬀerent losses

The eﬀect of boundary layer losses on detonation dynamics is shown in

Fig. 7, in terms of the normalized speed with respect to the position in a

cell. More than 60 points were sampled in a cell for each case, and the local

time-average speed was obtained with a running time average of 5 neigh-

bouring points. Evidently, the presence of wall losses modiﬁes the cellular

dynamics. Compared to the CJ case, the cases with losses have a larger de-

smaller minimum one before the collision of triple points. Whether it is the

losses that directly modify the ﬂow velocity inside the cellular structure, or

the increased activation energy due to velocity deﬁcits that results in such

larger ﬂuctuation, requires further conﬁrmation.

3.4.3. The D/DCJ − KM relationships

The variation of the velocity deﬁcit with respect to the Mirels’ constant

KM can be better appreciated from Fig. 8. The theoretical predictions were

obtained by solving the generalized ZND model with lateral ﬂow divergence

[23], using the present two-step reaction model. Clearly, the ZND model

underpredicts the velocity deﬁcit obtained from the quasi-2D simulations.

As the constant KM increases to the propagation limit, such discrepancy

becomes more signiﬁcant. These results are consistent with those reported

[16] and Reynaud et al.

[33], who also found the

underprediction of the velocity deﬁcit from the unsteady simulations by the

analytical model for relatively regular detonations.

3.4.4. The λ/λCJ − D/DCJ relationships

We have further obtained the dimensionless relationships in terms of the

detonation cell size (λ) and the characteristic induction zone length (∆) with

respect to the velocity deﬁcit, as shown in Fig. 9. λCJ and ∆CJ represent

the corresponding length scales of the ideal CJ detonation. The induction

length ∆ was obtained through zero-dimensional constant-volume combus-

tion calculations with the post-shock velocity (in the shock-attached frame

of reference) multiplying by the time to the peak thermicity, as proposed by

Shepherd [34]. The detailed chemistry mechanism was utilized in these calcu-

correspond to initial pressures of 4.1 kPa and 10.3 kPa, respectively. Note that the real-

chemistry constant-volume combustion calculations (∆/∆CJ ) of 6.9 kPa (denoted by the

lations. The excellent agreement between the λ/λCJ and ∆/∆CJ correlations

suggest that the increase in cell size due to wall losses is still controlled by

the increase in the induction zone length as a result of the velocity deﬁcits.

Assuming that the cell size varies with the induction zone thickness [34]

and that the ignition delay tig ∼ exp(Ea/RTs), we can thus get

temperature. The terms in brackets can be readily evaluated from the shock-

jump equations. In the limit of strong shock and high activation energy, we
can further simplify Eq. (12) to λ/λCJ (cid:117) exp {(2Ea/RTs,CJ ) (1 − D/DCJ )}.

It thus highlights the exponential sensitivity of the cell size and induction

zone length on velocity deﬁcit, which is controlled by the global activation

energy. This generalizes Desbordes’ observations for overdriven detonations

[35]. The results in Fig. 9 show that the λ/λCJ − D/DCJ correlations can be

well predicted by the simple expression (12). The sensitivity of cell size on

velocity deﬁcits also highlights the importance of providing the detonation

speed when reporting experimentally measured cell size, since the variation

can be up to an order of magnitude, even for the weakly sensitive mixtures

studied here.

4. Conclusions

The present study has shown that the dynamics of 2D cellular detonations

in narrow channels can be well captured using a quasi-2D approach modelling

the lateral boundary layer losses using Mirels’ theory. With an appropriate

Mirels’ constant, KM , deviating by approximately a factor of 2 from the

model proposed by Mirels for steady constant pressure boundary layers, the

simulations are found in excellent agreement with experiment. Compared to

directly resolving the boundary layers of detonations in the present narrow

channel experiments by calculating the 3D NS equations, this novel formu-

lation can save the computational cost by up to ﬁve orders of magnitude.

We have also shown that the cellular cycle dynamics is also aﬀected by the

20

losses, which yield larger velocity ﬂuctuations and more rapid decay rates

of the lead shock. Finally, the increase in cell size with increasing velocity

deﬁcit follows the Arrhenius dependence of ignition delay on the temperature

of an equivalent steady shock, in spite of the cellular dynamics, generalizing

previous observations of Desbordes for overdriven detonations in generally

regular mixtures.
