ABSTRACT

Two main models have been developed to explain the mechanisms of release,

heating and acceleration of the nascent solar wind, the wave-turbulence-driven

(WTD) models and reconnection-loop-opening (RLO) models, in which the

plasma release processes are fundamentally diﬀerent. Given that the statisti-

cal observational properties of helium ions produced in magnetically diverse

solar regions could provide valuable information for the solar wind modelling,

we examine the statistical properties of the helium abundance (AHe) and

the speed diﬀerence between helium ions and protons (vαp) for coronal holes

(CHs), active regions (ARs) and the quiet Sun (QS). We ﬁnd bimodal distri-

butions in the space of AHe and vαp/vA (where vA is the local Alfv´en speed)

for the solar wind as a whole. The CH wind measurements are concentrated

at higher AHe and vαp/vA values with a smaller AHe distribution range, while

the AR and QS wind is associated with lower AHe and vαp/vA, and a larger

AHe distribution range. The magnetic diversity of the source regions and the

physical processes related to it are possibly responsible for the diﬀerent prop-

erties of AHe and vαp/vA. The statistical results suggest that the two solar

wind generation mechanisms, WTD and RLO, work in parallel in all solar

wind source regions. In CH regions WTD plays a major role, whereas the

RLO mechanism is more important in AR and QS.

INTRODUCTION

Helium is ranked as the second most abundant element in the Sun and in the solar wind

(SW), and it is an important tool in exploring the nature of the solar wind. In particular,

the diﬀerence in the helium ion and proton properties can help us understand the mecha-

nisms for the release, heating and acceleration of the nascent solar wind (e.g., Marsch et al.

1982a; Neugebauer et al. 1996; Steinberg et al. 1996; Reisenfeld et al. 2001; Kasper et al.

2007, 2012). The abundance of helium (AHe) and the speed diﬀerence between helium ions

and protons (vαp) in the solar wind were extensively studied in the past. The abundance

of helium is about 8.5% in the photosphere (e.g., Grevesse & Sauval 1998; Asplund et al.

2009). Measurements of the corona above polar coronal holes and surrounding quiet Sun

areas showed that AHe is in the range 4% – 5% (Laming & Feldman 2001, 2003). The AHe is

usually below 5% in the solar wind and changes with the solar activity (Ogilvie & Hirshberg

1974; Feldman et al. 1978). Using data obtained by WIND, Aellig et al. (2001) conﬁrmed

this ﬁnding and also established that this tendency is more clear for the slow SW. By dividing

the solar wind into 25 speed intervals, Kasper et al. (2007, 2012) examined the relationship

between the helium abundance and the speed of the solar wind for a whole solar activity

cycle, and found a strong correlation between AHe and sunspot numbers for the slowest solar

wind.

The speeds of helium ions are usually larger than the proton speeds in the solar wind,

although helium ions are heavier than protons. Using data obtained by Helios, Marsch et al.

(1982a) analysed the speed diﬀerence between helium ions and protons, and found that vαp

increases with the solar wind speed. While vαp is close to the local Alfv´en wave speed in the

fast SW, the average vαp for the slow SW is close to zero, and vαp in the fast SW decreases

with the increase of the heliocentric distances at almost the same rate as of vA. Consequently,

these results were conﬁrmed from observations made by Ulysses (Neugebauer et al. 1996;

Reisenfeld et al. 2001), Wind (Steinberg et al. 1996), and ACE (Berger et al. 2011).

The plasma release, heating and acceleration mechanisms of the nascent solar wind are a

fundamental problem in solar and space physics. Two classes of models, the wave-turbulence-

driven (WTD) models (Hollweg 1986; Wang & Sheeley 1991; Cranmer et al. 2007; Verdini et al.

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2018)

2009) and the reconnection loop opening (RLO) models (Fisk et al. 1999; Fisk 2003; Schwadron & McComas

3

2003; Woo et al. 2004; Fisk & Zurbuchen 2006) have been proposed to account for this. The

essential diﬀerence between the two models is that the plasma escapes directly along open

magnetic ﬁeld lines in the WTD models, whereas in the RLO models the plasma is released

by reconnection between open magnetic ﬁeld lines and closed loops. Waves and turbulence

are all important in the two plasma release mechanisms. In the RLO models waves originate

in the reconnection process, while waves are generated by photospheric motions in the WTD

models (e.g., Fisk 2003; Cranmer et al. 2007; Cranmer 2009; Abbo et al. 2016). Determining

which physical mechanisms are at work and/or the extend of the contribution of any of the

mechanisms is prerequisite for establishing physically realistic models of the solar wind and

the heliosphere (Cranmer 2009).

Generally, the solar wind is categorised by speed. However, the speed is not the only

classiﬁcation criterion of the solar wind (Antiochos et al. 2012; Abbo et al. 2016). The solar

wind can also be diﬀerentiated by some of its in-situ measured properties, like for instance the

charge state (Zhao et al. 2009; Landi et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2014). As the charge state does

not change beyond several solar radii, it carries direct information about the temperature

of the source region (Owocki et al. 1983; Buergi & Geiss 1986). Based on the in-situ prop-

erties of the proton number density, proton temperature, magnetic ﬁled strength, and solar

wind speed, Xu & Borovsky (2015) classiﬁed the solar wind into four categories, coronal-

hole-origin plasma, streamer-belt-origin plasma, sector-reversal-region plasma, and ejecta.

In addition, on the basis of the above four category classiﬁcation, Camporeale et al. (2017)

developed a solar wind classiﬁcation algorithm using a Machine Learning algorithm.

The solar wind can also be classiﬁed by source regions (Neugebauer et al. 2002; Liewer et al.

2004; Fu et al. 2015, 2017; Zhao et al. 2017a,b). This is reasonable as CHs, ARs, and QS are

all regarded as the sources of the solar wind, but their actual contribution is still uncertain.

How the solar wind is produced in these regions is also still debatable. It is generally accepted

that CHs are the sources of the solar wind (e.g., Krieger et al. 1973; Gosling & Pizzo 1999).

The solar wind can also originate from QS regions (e.g., Woo & Habbal 2000; Feldman et al.

2005; Fu et al. 2015). Another source region of the solar wind that has been investigated

in detail recent years are the edges of active regions. From the comparison of the velocity

distributions at 2.5 R⊙ and potential ﬁeld extrapolations using Kitt Peak magnetograms,

Kojima et al. (1999) found that low-speed wind regions are associated with large magnetic

ﬁeld expansions originating from area adjacent to ARs. Shortly after Winebarger et al.

Hui Fu et al.

(2001) established the presence of intermittent ﬂows with velocities in the range of 5 –

20 km s−1 at the edge of an AR using data from the Transition Region and Coronal Ex-
plorer (TRACE) in the Fe ix/x 171 ˚A passband. With the launch of the Hinode spacecraft

it became possible to further investigate these regions using imaging and spectroscopic data.

Sakao et al. (2007) identiﬁed the existence of outﬂowing plasma at the periphery of ARs

in images taken with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) on board Hinode and obtained upward
Doppler velocities of ∼50 km s−1 using the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS)

on Hinode in an Fe xii line (no wavelength is mentioned in the article). Later, Del Zanna

(2008) and Harra et al. (2008) investigated these outﬂows obtaining upﬂow Doppler veloci-

ties ranging from 5 to 50 km s−1 in coronal lines. Bryans et al. (2010) established that the

outﬂows can be present for several days and also identiﬁed multiple velocity components in

the EIS Fe xii and Fe xiii lines of up to 200 km s−1. The follow-up ﬁnding of upﬂows at

heights between 1.5 and 2.5 R⊙ in the solar atmosphere using data from the Ultra-Violet

Coronagraph Spectrometer on board SoHO in the H i Ly α and O vi doublet lines at
1031.9 ˚A and 1037.6 ˚A (Zangrilli & Poletto 2012) further supported the evidence that AR

peripheries are a possible source of the slow SW. Several studies followed investigating both

observationally and through modelling the association of AR upﬂows with the solar wind

(He et al. 2010; van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2012; Culhane et al. 2014; Mandrini et al. 2014;

Brooks et al. 2015; Galsgaard et al. 2015; Vanninathan et al. 2015; Zangrilli & Poletto 2016;

Baker et al. 2017).

In the present paper, we analyse AHe and vαp/vA (where vA is the local Alfv´en speed)

of the solar wind for the three general types of solar regions, coronal holes (CHs), active

regions (ARs) and the quiet Sun (QS), during three phases of the solar activity cycle. The

magnetic ﬁeld structures are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in these three regions, with CHs generally

occupied by large scale open magnetic ﬁeld lines, whereas AR and QS regions are mainly

taken up by closed loops (Wiegelmann & Solanki 2004; Ito et al. 2010; Wiegelmann et al.

2014). We aim at demonstrating the diﬀerences in the properties of AHe and vαp/vA for

the three source region solar wind and during three phases of the solar cycle activity. Our

expectations are that statistical observational results on the variabilities of AHe and vαp/vA

produced in magnetically diverse solar regions may provide helpful and valuable information

for the solar wind modelling.

The paper is organised as follows: In Section 2, we describe the data and our method

marises the present study, ending with concluding remarks.

2 DATA AND ANALYSIS

The data used in this study are all obtained by the WIND spacecraft. The proton and

helium ion velocities and densities were recorded by the Solar Wind Experiment (SWE)

Faraday Cup instruments (Ogilvie et al. 1995). The AHe was obtained from the density

ratio between the helium ions and protons. The magnetic ﬁeld was measured by the Magnetic

Field Investigation (MFI) (Lepping et al. 1995). The speed uncertainties of the solar wind

are less than 0.16% (Kasper et al. 2006). In some cases, the SWE could not yield accurate

helium ion measurements (Steinberg et al. 1996). First, when the proton energy-per-charge

distribution is very broad, it makes the helium ion signal overpowered by the proton signal,

and thus the helium ion signal cannot be extracted. Second, when the helium ion ﬂux is

unusually low, it is down the detection threshold of the detectors. Third, if the solar wind

speed is too high, the helium ions may exceed the highest energy-per-charge step of SWE,

thus becoming undetectable. In order to ensure accurateness, we only use data that are free

of the above mentioned discrepancies. The time resolution of the data is 92 seconds. The data

were averaged over 1 hr. Generally, the direction of the vαp is assumed along the magnetic

ﬁeld lines (e.g., Asbridge et al. 1976; Marsch et al. 1982a; Steinberg et al. 1996; Berger et al.
2011; Reisenfeld et al. 2001). The vαp was calculated as vap = (vra − vrp)/cos(θ), where vra

and vrp are the radial speed of the helium ions and protons, respectively, and θ is the angle

between the radial vector and the magnetic ﬁeld. In order to reduce the uncertainties, we

discarded the observations in which θ is greater than 72.5 degrees (cos(θ) < 0.3) as done

in Reisenfeld et al. (2001). The vαp is usually compared with the local Alfv´en speed (vA;

Marsch et al. 1982a; Steinberg et al. 1996; Berger et al. 2011; Reisenfeld et al. 2001) which
was calculated as vA = 22.3 ∗ Brtn/p(np + 4 ∗ na), where Brtn, np, and na are the magnetic

ﬁled strength in nT, and density of proton and helium ions in number per cubic centimetre

(n/cc). At last, vαp was divided by vA.

For completeness, we repeat here the description of the two-step mapping procedure

(Neugebauer et al. 1998, 2002; Liewer et al. 2004) that was used in tracing the solar wind

back to the solar surface (already described in Fu et al. (2015, 2017)). First, each solar wind

parcel is traced back in a ballistic approach to the source surface which is implemented by

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2018)

6

Hui Fu et al.

the coronal magnetic ﬁeld model. Second, the wind parcel is traced from the source surface

to the photosphere by following the magnetic ﬁled lines computed by a potential ﬁeld source

surface (PFSS) model (Schatten et al. 1969; Altschuler & Newkirk 1969). The footpoints of

the solar wind parcels were then placed on the photospheric magnetograms obtained with

the Michelson Doppler imager (MDI, Scherrer et al. 1995) and the EUV images taken by

the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT, Delaboudini`ere et al. 1995) on board Solar

and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO, Domingo et al. 1995). The regions with the located

footpoints were then categorised into three groups. The solar wind was named by the three

type of source regions they originate from, CH, AR, or QS wind.

The categorisation scheme is demonstrated in Figure 1. The footpoint locations are
overplotted on the EIT 284 ˚A images (a1, b1, c1, d1) and MDI magnetograms (a2, b2,

c2, d2) marked by red crosses. The classiﬁcation of the source regions relies on the coronal

hole and magnetically concentrated area boundaries. The wind is classiﬁed as CH wind if

its footpoints are located within the CH boundaries. An AR wind is deﬁned if its footpoints

fall in a magnetically concentrated area which is a numbered NOAA AR. When a footpoint

is positioned out of any CH and magnetically concentrated area, it is then marked as a QS

wind. More details on how the boundaries are determined, as well as the classiﬁcation of the

source regions and the tracing back procedure, can be found in Fu et al. (2015, 2017).

The intervals occupied by Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) were discarded
where the charge states O7+/O6+ exceed 6.008exp(−0.00578v), where v is the ICME speed
in km s−1 (Richardson & Cane 2004). The daily averaged solar wind velocity was used in

tracing the solar wind back to the source surface, therefore one footpoint for each day is

determined. The data used here cover the years from 2000 to 2008. This time period covers

the solar maximum (2000 – 2001, hereafter MAX), the decline (2002 – 2006, DEC), and the

minimum phases (2007 – 2008, MIN) of cycle 23. The statistical results are based on the

following number of measurements. For the full speed range (Figure 3), the hourly in-situ

samples of the solar wind are 2844, 694, 1634, and 516 for the solar wind as a whole, CH,

AR, and QS wind during solar maximum, respectively. The hourly in-situ samples of the

solar wind are 6362, 2340, 2282, and 1740, respectively during DEC, and 2169, 635, 352,

1182 during the MIN phase.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Full speed range solar wind

Figure 2 presents the scatter (left panel) and contour (right panel) plots of the solar wind

measurements in speed, AHe, and vαp/vA space. Clearly, the solar wind as a whole is separated

into two main parts in the three-dimensional space which is more evident from the contour

plots. One part lies in the region of higher AHe and vαp/vA, and a wider speed range, coming

mainly from CHs. In contrast, the other part has lower values of AHe, vαp/vA, and a wider

AHe range, that mainly originates from AR and QS regions. The quantitative analyses of

AHe and vαp/vA for the three source region solar wind are given in the following.

Figure 3 (ﬁrst column) shows the measurements of AHe vs vαp/vA for the solar wind as
a whole. The ranges of AHe (0 – 10) and vαp/vA (−1.0 – 1.0) are divided into 20 parts.

This means that delta AHe and delta vαp/vA are 0.5 and 0.1, respectively, and the space of

AHe and vαp/vA is divided into 400 subsections. We also made estimations of the AHe vs

vαp/vA for each individual source region, namely, CH, AR and QS (second, third and fourth

columns, respectively) that make the total contribution in the ﬁrst column of Figure 3. The

results are also obtained for the three solar cycle phases, the MAX, the DEC, and the MIN

as the AHe is known to change with the solar cycle activity (Aellig et al. 2001; Kasper et al.

for diﬀerent source region solar wind.

2007, 2012). The solar wind as a whole (ﬁrst column in Figure 3) has a bimodal distribution

in the AHe and vαp/vA space. In order to give a quantitative evaluation of the two peaks

of the distribution, we estimated the proportions of the count measurements of AHe and

vαp/vA averaged over 1 hr located inside the 50% contour lines of the solar wind as a whole.

One of the peaks of this distribution lies in the range of higher AHe and vαp/vA (hereafter

H av) and has proportions of 25%, 33%, and 26% of the total counts for the solar MAX,

DEC and MIN. The proportions are given in each panel of Figure 3. In H av the AHe ranges

are 3.75 – 5.75, 3.75 – 5.75, and 3.5 – 5.25, and the vαp ranges are 0.3 – 0.7, 0.3 – 0.8, and 0.2

– 0.7, respectively. In contrast, the other peak covers lower values of AHe and vαp/vA with

contributions of 48%, 27%, and 34% during the MAX, DEC, and MIN (hereafter L av). The

corresponding AHe ranges are 1.25 – 5.50, 1.00 – 3.75, and 0.25 – 3.00, while the vαp ranges
are −0.3 – 0.2, −0.2 – 0.1, and −0.2 – 0.1. It is notable that the AHe distribution ranges

of H av are narrower than the ranges of L av, 2.0 vs 4.25, 2.0 vs 2.75, and 1.75 vs 2.75,

during the MAX, DEC and MIN, respectively. We note that Bourouaine et al. (2011) have

also obtained a bimodal distribution in the AHe and vαp/vA space. However, the diﬀerence

from their study (see their Figure 3) is that we give the distributions for the solar wind

originating from various source regions.

We then estimated the count contributions of H av and L av for each of the solar wind

source regions by applying the same AHe and vαp/vA ranges as estimated from the whole Sun

bimodal distribution. A noticeable ﬁnding here is that the CH wind counts are concentrated

Figure 3. Contour plots of the solar wind originating in CH, AR, and QS regions in the AHe and vαp/vA space. The ﬁrst
to fourth columns correspond to the wind as a whole, and from CH, AR, and QS regions, respectively. The top, middle, and
bottom panels represent the solar maximum, decline, and minimum phases. The percentages of the samples located in the
concentrations of higher AHe and vαp/vA values (H av) and lower AHe and vαp/vA values (L av) are also given. The solid
line contour corresponds to 50% and the outer contour to 10%.

in the H av (Figure 3, second column). The lower limit contributions of H av are much higher

than those of L av for CH wind. In contrast, for the AR and QS wind the proportions of

L av are much higher than H av (Figure 3, third and fourth column). Thus, the AR and the

QS wind counts are predominantly located in the L av.

How the results change if the three types (CH, AR, and QS) solar wind are determined

more restrictively? Usually the footpoints of the solar wind stay in a particular region for a

few days (as shown in Figure 1 of Fu et al. (2017)). A boundary wind is deﬁned when the

footpoint of the solar wind moves from one region to another (Neugebauer et al. 2002). Here,

if the footpoint is located at the same region for more than 2 days, the solar wind associated

with the ﬁrst and last 12 hours, between the change of the footpoint location is deﬁned as

a boundary wind. This way only the core wind for a certain region can be extracted. As

expected, the samples of the data become smaller. However, the distribution characteristics

of the core solar wind are almost the same as in the original selection scheme. The only clear

diﬀerence is that the proportions of L av decrease for the CH wind.

Several studies indicate that the solar wind produced by the WTD mechanism has higher

AHe and vαp, while the solar wind may have lower AHe and vαp when the RLO mechanism is

at work. While it is challenging to obtain direct observations of the AHe in the solar corona,

ﬁrst ionisation potential (FIP) bias measurements are more readily available. It is found that

generally the FIP bias is higher in AR and QS regions (mainly occupied by closed loops)

than in CH regions (generally taken up by open magnetic ﬁeld lines) (Widing & Feldman

2001; Feldman et al. 2005; Brooks & Warren 2011; Baker et al. 2013). It is believed that the

reason for the enrichment of the low FIP ions in the corona and the solar wind is that they

are ionized earlier in comparison to high FIP elements. The helium has the highest FIP and

remains neutral longest. This results in the enrichment/depletion of low FIP elements/helium

because only ions interact with waves (Laming 2012, 2015, 2017). It means that the helium

abundance should be inversely proportional to the low FIP bias elements in the corona.

Thus, the AHe is higher in open magnetic ﬁeld structures and lower in closed loops if the

above mechanism is valid. The helium abundance for the fast SW coming from large CHs

is higher and remarkably stable (Schwenn 2006). In contrast, Rakowski & Laming (2012)

suggested that the helium is depleted in closed loops and the depletion eﬃciency is higher

in larger loops, and lower in smaller loops. Furthermore, from simulations, Laming (2017)

showed that the AHe is higher in open magnetic ﬁeld regions and it is lower in closed loops.

Suess et al. (2009) found that the solar wind that comes from big streamers has lower helium

abundance. The solar wind can be produced by interchange reconnection in the streamers

(Huang et al. 2016). This gives the observational support to the notion that the AHe is lower

in the closed loops as streamer structures are composed by very large closed loops.

As already mentioned, the speeds of helium ions are usually larger than protons, al-

though the helium ions are heavier than protons. Generally, it is believed that the he-

lium ions are heated by resonant wave-particle interactions (e.g., Hollweg & Turner 1978;

McKenzie & Marsch 1982; Isenberg 1984) with waves preferentially heating the heavy ions,

making them faster than protons. This means that the wave acceleration is the reason why

there is a speed diﬀerence between helium ions and protons (Cranmer et al. 2008). The

fact that vαp decreases with heliocentric distances (Marsch et al. 1982a; Neugebauer et al.

1996; Reisenfeld et al. 2001) suggests that the speed diﬀerence between the helium ions and

protons is produced near the Sun. Therefore, it supports the idea that the wave super-

acceleration of helium ions takes place near the Sun, possibly in the region of acceleration

of the solar wind (Neugebauer et al. 1996). For the solar wind that escapes directly along

open magnetic ﬁeld lines, the wave accelerated solar wind starts from the chromosphere,

whereas the solar wind released from closed loops is initiated higher in the solar atmosphere.

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2018)

11

It is possible that the solar wind that escapes directly along open magnetic ﬁeld lines has

more time to make a speed diﬀerence compared with the wind released from loops. This

speculation, however, needs to be further supported by modeling. The above eﬀects indicate

that the wind that escapes directly along open magnetic ﬁeld lines (treated by the WTD

models) has larger vαp, whereas the solar wind released from closed loops (e.g., RLO models)

has smaller vαp (Stakhiv et al. 2016).

However, the vαp will also be aﬀected in the following propagation process. First, it

is constrained by various instabilities such as the Alfv´en/ion-cyclotron and fast-magneto-

sonic/whistler instabilities (Bourouaine et al. 2013). Qualitatively, those instabilities are only

valid when the vαp nears or exceeds the local Alfv´en speed (Li & Habbal 2000; Verscharen & Chandran

2013; Lu et al. 2009), therefore they have smaller eﬀect on the solar wind with small vαp/vA.

Second, collisions can reduce vαp in the solar wind (e.g., Marsch et al. 1982b; Kasper et al.

2008). Bourouaine et al. (2011) found a general inverse relationship between the vαp/vA and

collisional age, which means the collisions are important. This should be more signiﬁcant for

the slow SW which has higher collisional age. However, the distribution range in collisional

age and vαp/vA space are very large (Figure 2 (b) in Bourouaine et al.,2011) which indicates
that vαp may still persist in part of the slow speed SW (speed less than 500 km s−1). Here,

the distributions in AHe and vαp/vA space for the intermediate SW (with speed greater than
400 km s−1 and less than 500 km s−1) demonstrate that a higher vαp/vA at ∼0.4 could still
be found in the solar wind whose speed is less than 500 km s−1 (see Section 3.2 and Figure 5

below for justiﬁcations).

Fu et al. (2017) suggested that the two-peak distribution of CH wind and the anti-

correlation between the speed and O7+/O6+ can be explained qualitatively by both the

WTD and RLO models, implying that the combination of the two classes of mechanisms

may be at work (Cranmer 2009). The clear bimodal distribution in space of AHe and vαp/vA

for the solar wind as a whole (Figure 2 and the ﬁrst column of Figure 3) can also result

from the interplay of the direct plasma release mechanism along open magnetic ﬁeld lines

treated by the WTD models and via reconnection between closed and open ﬁelds in the

RLO models. This is consistent with the idea that the WTD and RLO scenarios do not need

to be ‘mutually exclusive with each other’ as suggested by Cranmer (2009) and Abbo et al.

(2016).

The distributions in space of AHe and vαp/vA for the solar wind that originates from

various source regions (the second to fourth columns of Figure 3) provide additional sup-

Hui Fu et al.

port to the notion that possibly the WTD and RLO mechanisms work together. Spectro-

scopic observations have shown that there exists a stable outﬂow at the base of CH regions

(Hassler et al. 1999; Xia et al. 2003, 2004; Tu et al. 2005) and the outﬂow usually corre-

sponds to concentrations of unipolar magnetic ﬁelds (Xia et al. 2003, 2004) where the open

magnetic ﬁeld lines are rooted. On the other hand, closed loops dominate in ARs and QS,

and therefore, the solar wind plasma is more likely to be released by magnetic reconnection

between closed loops and open magnetic ﬁeld lines (Neugebauer et al. 2002; Feldman et al.

2005; Harra et al. 2008; He et al. 2010; Zangrilli & Poletto 2012; van Driel-Gesztelyi et al.

2012; Culhane et al. 2014; Mandrini et al. 2014; Baker et al. 2017).

The low count number at L av and H av for the three types solar wind can also be ex-

plained reasonably by the above suggestion. For the CH wind (Figure 3, second column) these

L av measurements could be interpreted as related to magnetic reconnection between open

magnetic ﬁeld lines and loops along CH boundaries, as well as loops associated with small

magnetic bipoles, in particular with the emergence of ephemeral regions. In ARs (Figure 3,

third column), a low count H av is possibly related to small-scale coronal holes adjacent to

ARs which are often obscured by overlying large loops coming out of the ARs (e.g., Wang

2017). The domination of L av in the QS is logical as this region is predominately seeded

by closed loops. The existence of open ﬁeld lines in QS regions explains the presence of

H av counts that are smaller but still signiﬁcant (Woo & Habbal 1997; Habbal et al. 1997;

Woo & Habbal 2000).

The observational results for the AHe distribution ranges of H av and L av in Figure 3

can be reasonably interpreted as an interplay of the WTD and RLO mechanisms as suggested

above. The AHe distribution ranges are smaller for the H av (2.00, 2.00, and 1.75 during

MAX, DEC, and MIN) compared with the L av (4.25, 2.75, and 2.75). The simulations by

Rakowski & Laming (2012) have shown that closed loops show a depletion eﬀect on helium

ions, and the depletion eﬃciency is higher in larger loops and lower in smaller loops. There-

fore, the distributions of AHe are shifted towards lower values and the distribution ranges

are wider for the L av for regions populated by larger loops (e.g., Wiegelmann & Solanki

2004; Feldman et al. 2005).

3.2 Slow, intermediate, and fast solar wind

The results for the solar wind in full speed range (Figure 3), show a clear bimodal distribution

denoted as H av and L av. Generally, the solar wind is divided into two categories, fast and

slow SW, and two thresholds are usually chosen, 400 km s−1 (e.g. Schwenn 2006) or 500

km s−1 (e.g. Fu et al. 2015; Stakhiv et al. 2016; Fu et al. 2017). To separate the distribution

characteristics of Figure 2, we divided the solar wind into three categories, slow SW (speed

of less than 400 km s−1), intermediate SW (speed greater than 400 km s−1 and less than 500

km s−1), and fast SW (greater than 500 km s−1). To explore the distribution characteristics of

the solar wind in diﬀerent speed ranges for the three source regions, we produced distributions

in AHe and vαp/vA space for the slow SW, intermediate SW, and fast SW given in Figure 4,

Figure 5, and Figure 6, respectively.

Figure 4 shows the distributions in AHe and vαp/vA space for the slow SW only. The

proportions of L av are much higher than that of H av (generally far below 10%, except for

CHs). The measurements for the slow SW are mainly concentrated at lower AHe and vαp/vA

values with wider AHe distribution ranges for all three types slow SW. In contrast, the fast

SW (Figure 6) is mainly distributed at higher AHe and vαp/vA values with narrower AHe

distribution ranges for all three types fast SW. The diﬀerence in the proportions of H av and

L av for the intermediate SW are obvious comparing the slow SW (dominant L av) and fast

SW (dominant H av). H av and L av are both present in all three types intermediate SW

(Figure 5), with H av that is dominant during the MAX and DEC phases for the whole SW.

In general, the distributions for the intermediate SW are more complex than for the slow

SW and fast SW which could be seen in Figure 5, second (CHs), third (ARs), and fourth

column (QS). As we suggested, the L av is produced by the RLO mechanism, whereas the

H av associates with the WTD mechanism. Our results indicate that the slow SW is mainly

produced by the RLO mechanism, in contrast the fast SW is mainly generated by the WTD

regardless of the source types of the solar wind. The WTD and RLO mechanisms are both

present in the intermediate SW, with a diﬀerent input of each mechanism for the diﬀerent

source regions and during diﬀerent phases of the solar cycle activity. The L av for the AR

region solar wind is most probably related to AR edge outﬂows (see Sect. 1) released into

the solar wind through magnetic reconnection of the AR loops and open magnetic ﬁeld lines

of adjacent CHs.

Based on in-situ observations, Stakhiv et al. (2016) suggested that the solar wind with

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2018)

Figure 4. As in Figure 3, but for the slow SW only.

a speed of less than 500 km s−1 can be divided into two types, one that is alike the fast

SW and the other originating from closed loops. It is clear that the fast SW and “the wind

originating from closed loops” in Stakhiv et al. (2016) can be associated with both the WTD

and RLO mechanisms. Based on the present statistical results, an interplay of the WTD and

RLO mechanisms is present for the solar wind of less than 500 km s−1. Therefore, our results

give the observational support to the suggestion of Stakhiv et al. (2016).

4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

The main purpose of the present work was to examine the statistical properties of the AHe

and vαp/vA and their distributional characteristics in space of AHe and vαp/vA for three

source region solar wind, CHs, ARs and QS. The main results are summarised as follows:

(i) We found bimodal distributions of the solar wind as a whole in the AHe and vαp/vA

space. One peak lies in the range of higher values of AHe and vαp/vA. In contrast, the other

peak is located at lower values of AHe and vαp/vA. The analysis for the three source region

solar wind shows that the CH wind counts are concentrated at higher AHe and vαp/vA values

with narrower AHe distribution ranges, while the AR and QS wind is mainly located at lower

AHe and vαp/vA with larger AHe distribution ranges.

(ii) Almost all of the slow SW (fast SW) measurements are concentrated at lower (higher)

AHe and vαp/vA values with wider (narrower) AHe distribution ranges regardless of the source

region type. In contrast, the H av and L av are both present in all three types (CH, AR,

and QS) intermediate SW.

Hui Fu et al.

The results demonstrate that there are clear diﬀerences of AHe and vαp/vA for the three

source region solar wind. This indicates that the conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld has

inﬂuence on the AHe and vαp/vA properties. We suggest that the two solar wind generation

mechanisms, the wave-turbulence-driven (WTD) and the reconnection-loop opening (RLO),

work in parallel in all solar wind source regions. In CH regions WTD plays a major role,

whereas RLO is more important in AR and QS regions.

The statistical results for diﬀerent speed range solar wind indicate that the slow SW

(speed less than 400 km s−1) is mainly produced by the RLO mechanism, in contrast the fast

SW (speed greater than 500 km s−1) is mainly generated by the WTD mechanism regardless

of the source types of the solar wind. Whereas both the WTD and RLO mechanisms play

role for the generation of the intermediate SW (speed range 400 – 500 km s−1).

The future Solar Orbiter mission that comes as close as 0.285 AU to the Sun should

help reduce the uncertainties in tracing the solar wind back to the Sun and thus bring more

accurate evaluation of the properties of AHe and vαp for diﬀerent source region solar wind.
