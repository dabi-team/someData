Abstract We investigate the morphological and magnetic characteristics of solar
active region (AR) NOAA 12192. AR 12192 was the largest region of Solar Cycle
24; it underwent noticeable growth and produced 6 X-class ﬂares, 22 M-class
ﬂares, and 53 C-class ﬂares in the course of its disc passage. However, the most
peculiar fact of this AR is that it was associated with only one CME in spite of
producing several X-class ﬂares. In this work, we carry out a comparative study
between the eruptive and non-eruptive ﬂares produced by AR 12192. We ﬁnd
that the magnitude of abrupt and permanent changes in the horizontal magnetic
ﬁeld and Lorentz force are signiﬁcantly smaller in the case of the conﬁned ﬂares
compared to the eruptive one. We present the areal evolution of AR 12192
during its disc passage. We ﬁnd the ﬂare-related morphological changes to be
weaker during the conﬁned ﬂares, whereas the eruptive ﬂare exhibits a rapid and
permanent disappearance of penumbral area away from the magnetic neutral line
after the ﬂare. Furthermore, from the extrapolated nonlinear force-free magnetic
ﬁeld, we examine the overlying coronal magnetic environment over the eruptive
and non-eruptive zones of the AR. We ﬁnd that the critical decay index for
the onset of torus instability was achieved at a lower height over the eruptive
ﬂaring region, than for the non-eruptive core area. These results suggest that
the decay rate of the gradient of overlying magnetic ﬁeld strength may play a
decisive role to determine the CME productivity of the AR. In addition, the
magnitude of changes in the ﬂare-related magnetic characteristics are found to
be well correlated with the nature of solar eruptions.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are believed to be the most
violent and energetic phenomena that occur in the solar atmosphere. Together
they can release highly energetic particle radiation and gigantic clouds of ionized
gas that may have severe impacts on the human high-tech activities in outer
space (Gosling, 1993; Siscoe, 2000; Daglis et al., 2004). Several studies have
been made to understand the physical processes behind the origin of CMEs and
solar ﬂares (Kahler, 1992; Gosling, 1993). Nevertheless, the initiation mechanism
of CMEs and their association with ﬂares still remain as one of the most elusive
topics in solar physics (Schrijver, 2009).

Earlier observations reveal that ﬂares and CMEs can be regarded as two
diﬀerent manifestations of the same energy release process (Harrison, 1995;
Zhang et al., 2001; Harrison, 2003). Zhang et al. (2001) illustrated that the
fast acceleration phase of CMEs in the inner corona is temporally correlated
with the rise time of the associated soft X-ray ﬂares, suggesting both of the
phenomena to be connected through the same physical process, possibly via
magnetic reconnection (Lin and Forbes, 2000; Priest and Forbes, 2002). Despite
the intrinsic physical relationship between ﬂares and CMEs, observations reveal
that not all ﬂares are associated with CMEs (Andrews, 2003; Yashiro et al.,
2005).

Several attempts have been made to explore the possible circumstances under
which solar ﬂares may lead to failed eruptions. From a comparative study be-
tween four eruptive and four non-eruptive X-class ﬂares produced from diﬀerent
active regions (AR), Wang and Zhang (2007) found that the conﬁned ﬂares
tend to occur close to the magnetic center of the AR whereas the eruptive
ones generally occur away from the magnetic center. T¨or¨ok and Kliem (2005),
Kliem and T¨or¨ok (2006), Fan and Gibson (2007), and Olmedo and Zhang (2010)
investigated the conditions leading to instability of the ﬂux rope structures in
the context of the torus instability, which is one of the ideal MHD instabilities
(Priest, 2014). They found that the gradient of the overlying magnetic ﬁeld
strength exhibits a critical limit that may determine whether the ﬂux rope will
result in eruption or not. Furthermore, Liu (2008) carried out a comparative
study among the ten events including four failed eruptions (FE), four eruptions
due to torus instability (TI) and two eruptions due to kink instability (KI) from
diﬀerent ARs. His results led him to speculate that the gradient of overlying
magnetic ﬁeld strength decays faster in TI and KI driven events in comparison
to the FE events.

The above results depict the role of background magnetic-ﬁeld strength in de-
termining the conﬁnement behavior of the solar eruptions. To further investigate
the distinct properties of conﬁned and eruptive events, we perform a comparative
study of the eruptive and non-eruptive ﬂares produced by AR 12192, which was
the largest active region of Solar Cycle 24. However, the most peculiar aspect
of this AR was that it produced six X-class ﬂares during its disc passage but
none of them were associated with CMEs. However, from a study of ﬂare-CME
association rate it was found that 75 % of GOES ﬂare ≥ X1.0 class are CME
productive, and for the ﬂare class ≥ X2.5 the CME association rate is more than

90 % (Yashiro et al., 2006). Thus the ﬂare-rich but CME-poor AR 12192 drew
considerable attention from the solar community (Sun et al., 2015; Chen et al.,
2015; Thalmann et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016).

AR 12192 crossed the visible solar disc from 17 to 30 October 2014 and
produced 6 X-class ﬂares, 22 M-class ﬂares, and 53 C-class ﬂares. Notably, all
of the energetic conﬁned ﬂares produced by AR 12192 occurred in the core
region of that AR. On 24 October, this AR produced one X3.1-class ﬂare, which
became a record-setting event in ﬂare energy associated with a conﬁned eruption
(RHESSI, science nugget no.239). As the location (S16W21) of the AR was
very close to the solar disc center during that high energetic X3.1-class ﬂare,
an Earthward-directed halo CME event was expected. However, no CME was
observed. Throughout the whole disc passage only one CME was produced by
this AR, during an M4.0-class ﬂare that occurred away from the core region on
24 October. Li et al. (2015) reported that this eruptive ﬂare occurred close to
the open-ﬁeld-line region in which the large coronal loops, appearing as extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) structures, fan out rapidly. They suggested that the interac-
tion between the ﬂare material and the neighboring open ﬁeld lines may have
caused the M4.0-class ﬂare to become eruptive.

The production of several non-eruptive highly energetic X-class ﬂares, as well
as the CME-associated M4.0-class ﬂare, made the AR 12192 a unique target for
a comparative study of the eruptive and non-eruptive ﬂares originating from the
same AR. In this work, we particularly aim to study the ﬂare related changes

in morphological and magnetic characteristics associated with both the conﬁned
and eruptive ﬂares produced by AR 12192. In order to understand the changes in
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld related to ﬂares, several studies have been made in
the past (Sudol and Harvey, 2005; Petrie and Sudol, 2010; Wang, 2006; Kumar
et al., 2016a). Wang and Liu (2010) found an increase of transverse ﬁeld at
the polarity inversion line (PIL) for 11 X-class ﬂares. Petrie (2012) analyzed
six major ﬂares of four active regions, NOAA 11158, 11166, 11283, and 11429,
and he found an increase in ﬁeld strength in each case at the time of the
ﬂare, particularly in its transverse component close to the polarity inversion line
(PIL). This increase in the transverse component of photospheric magnetic ﬁeld
was accompanied by a large, abrupt, downward vertical Lorentz-force change.
Kumar et al. (2016a) suggested that the ﬂare-associated Lorentz-force impulse
could power the photospheric and chromospheric oscillations. A detailed physical
explanation of these was ﬁrst given by Fletcher and Hudson (2008). However,
the ﬂare-related photospheric magnetic ﬁeld and Lorentz-force changes in the
case of conﬁned ﬂares are poorly studied. In that way, AR 12192 gave a unique
opportunity to verify and extend the above results for the several conﬁned ﬂares
produced by it. In addition we examine the pre-ﬂare overlying coronal magnetic
environment for both the eruptive and non-eruptive zone of the AR in the con-
text of torus instability. In earlier studies, using a potential-ﬁeld-extrapolation
model, Thalmann et al. (2015) found a similar strong constraint on the overlying
magnetic ﬁeld for both the eruptive and non-eruptive ﬂares. However, in this
work we have extrapolated the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld using non linear
force free ﬁeld (NLFFF) (Aschwanden, 2016) extrapolation, which is believed
to be more realistic than the potential-ﬁeld-extrapolation technique (Schrijver,
2009). In Section 2, we present the data analysis and methodology. The distinct
properties of the conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares are given in Section 3. Finally, we
summarize our results in Section 4.

2. Data Analysis

The evolution of AR 12192 in the course of its disc passage was well recorded by
the observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on-
board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin
2012).

To study the photospheric magnetic-ﬁeld evolution of AR 12192, we have
used the HMI vector magnetogram series from the version of Space weather HMI
Active Region Patches (SHARP; Turmon et al. 2010) having spatial resolution
of 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) and 12 minute temporal cadence. The Stokes parameters I, Q, U, and
V were derived from the ﬁltergrams of six polarization states at six wavelengths
centered on the Fe I 617.3 nm spectral line and were inverted using the Very Fast
Inversion of the Stokes Algorithm code (Borrero et al., 2011) to obtain the vector
magnetic-ﬁeld components in the photosphere. The remaining 180◦ ambiguity in
the azimuthal ﬁeld component was resolved using the minimum energy method
(Metcalf, 1994; Leka, Barnes, and Crouch, 2009). A coordinate transformation

for remapping the vector ﬁelds onto the Lambert cylindrical equal area projection
was carried out, and ﬁnally the vector ﬁelds were transformed into heliocentric
spherical coordinates.

As the errors in the horizontal-ﬁeld components of the vector magnetic ﬁeld
increase towards the limb, we have restricted our analysis to only those major
ﬂares produced by AR 12192 when the center position of the AR was well within
± 45◦ from the central meridian. Thus our data set contains three X-class ﬂares
and two M-class ﬂares (Table 1) observed during 22 - 25 October 2014 close to
disc center. The typical error in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld of the SHARP
data product is 100 Gauss, whereas the error in the line-of-sight component is 5
- 10 Gauss (Liu et al., 2012; Hoeksema et al., 2014).

As a complementary dataset we have used UV images (94 ˚A, 1600 ˚A) taken
from SDO/AIA. AIA 94 ˚A images represent the hot solar corona at a tempera-
ture of six million Kelvin. In particular, these images are useful to study the post
ﬂare loops ﬁlled with hot plasma due to chromospheric evaporation (Doschek and
Warren, 2005). AIA 1600 ˚A images represent the lower chromospheric region,
which is known as the transition region of the solar atmosphere. These images
are useful to identify the spatial locations of the ﬂare ribbons, which are believed
to be the low altitude impact of the accelerated particles ﬂowing down from the
reconnection site along the reconnected magnetic-ﬁeld line (Priest and Forbes,
2002).

The sunspot group within AR 12192 belongs to the complex βγδ class, with
spots of opposite sign in the same penumbrae. AR 12192 showed morphologi-
cal changes (Figure 2) as well as the changes in magnetic topology during its
evolution throughout the disc passage. Therefore, the time-series analysis for
each ﬂare of our data set have been carried out within diﬀerent bounded regions
enclosing the locations of sheared horizontal ﬁeld close to the polarity inversion
line (PIL) where the major changes in horizontal ﬁeld and Lorentz force are
expected to occur (Petrie, 2012). In order to deﬁne the size, orientation, and
location of the selected boxes we examined the post-ﬂare loops in AIA 94 ˚A
images. As the post-ﬂare arcades are believed to be the regions above which
magnetic reconnection occurs (Liu et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Joshi, Magara,
and Inoue, 2014; Kumar et al., 2016b), we have selected our region of interest by
enclosing the major post ﬂare arcade structures seen in AIA 94 ˚A images (Figure
3). A time-series analysis of magnetic-ﬁeld evolution and Lorentz-force changes

of sheared PIL where the major ﬂares occurred, we have overplotted the ﬂaring
pixels observed in the AIA 1600 ˚A image at the ﬂare peak time and drawn the
PIL on the magnetogram data (Figure 3) for each ﬂare of our data set.

For identiﬁcation of the PIL we have followed the following steps: First we
have convolved all of the pixels with a Gaussian kernel. Then, centering each pixel
of the magnetogram of vertical component of magnetic ﬁeld, we have scanned
ﬁve consecutive pixels in both the horizontal and vertical directions. After that
we compared the maximum and minimum values of each vertical and horizontal
array of ﬁve pixels. If these two values are opposite in sign and the magnitude

These pixels were then
joined to make the PIL.

To calculate the Lorentz-force changes we have used the formulation intro-

duced by Fisher et al. (2012). The formulation is given as below,

where Bh and Br are the horizontal and radial components of the magnetic ﬁeld,
Fh and Fr are the horizontal and radial components of the Lorentz force calcu-
lated over the volume of the active region, Aph is the area of the photospheric
domain containing the active region, and dA is the elementary surface area on
the photosphere.

To study the ﬂare-related morphological changes of AR 12192 we have used
the full-disc continuum images observed in the Fe I absorption line at 6173 ˚A
with a spatial scale of 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) per pixel and temporal scale of 12 minutes. We have
taken a cutout of the whole active region from the full-disc continuum intensity
map and then all of the images were diﬀerentially rotated to the solar disc
center. To identify the umbra–penumbra and penumbra–quiet-Sun boundaries,
we ﬁrst have normalized the brightness values of all the pixels within the cutout
region by the median of brightness values of a 10×10 pixel2 quiet-Sun region
surrounding the sunspot. Then a cumulative histogram (Pettauer and Brandt,
1997; Mathew et al., 2007) of the intensity of each pixel’s brightness is computed
within the cutout, which encloses the umbral and penumbral region as well as the
immediately surrounding quiet-Sun region. This cumulative histogram (Figure
4) is used to calculate the intensity threshold for deﬁning the umbra–penumbra
and penumbra–quiet-Sun boundary.

The steep rise in the histogram plot (upper panel of Figure 4) near the normal-
ized intensity unity corresponds to the quiet-Sun region, whereas the ﬂattest part
of the plot corresponds to the umbral region. In between the above two parts of
the plot, the less steep and moderately ﬂatter part denotes the penumbral region.
In order to get the threshold values, both of the nearly ﬂat parts of the plot
were linearly ﬁtted. The maximum intensity at which the linearly ﬁtted straight
lines start deviating from the plot is considered to be the intensity threshold.
Applying the above procedure to the cumulative histogram computed from the
cutout region enclosing the source location of eruptive M4.0-class ﬂare on 24
October 2014, we have found the normalized intensity threshold for the umbra–
penumbra boundary is 0.56 and that of penumbra–quiet-Sun boundary is 0.92.
These values were then used to calculate the penumbral area variation during
the eruptive M4.0-class ﬂare. To study the overall umbral and penumbral area
variation of the whole AR during its disc passage, we have used the normalized
intensity threshold for the umbral–penumbral boundary as 0.53 and that of the
penumbral–quiet-Sun boundary as 0.90 (Sarkar, Srivastava, and Dhara, 2017).

Furthermore, to investigate the overlying magnetic-ﬁeld strength for both
the eruptive and non-eruptive region of AR 12192, we have extrapolated the
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld using the non linear force free ﬁeld (NLFFF) model
(Aschwanden, 2016). From the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld we have calculated
the decay index over the non-eruptive core region and the eruptive ﬂaring region

n = −

where h is the height above the solar photosphere and Bex is the external mag-
netic ﬁeld obtained from the extrapolated ﬁeld. According to the deﬁnition, as
the decay index [n] quantiﬁes how the external magnetic ﬁeld is decaying with
respect to height, it has been used to infer the constraint of overlying magnetic-
ﬁeld strength in several studies (T¨or¨ok and Kliem, 2005; Wang and Zhang, 2007;
Liu, 2008). The critical decay index for onset of the torus instability has been
found to be ≈1.5 (T¨or¨ok and Kliem, 2007; Aulanier et al., 2010).

Analyzing the six-hour series of vector magnetogram data for each of the
non-eruptive ﬂare of our dataset, we have found that the integrated transverse
magnetic ﬂux over the selected regions near the PIL, increased permanently for
all of the cases (Figure 5). This result is consistent with the earlier ﬂare-related
transverse-magnetic-ﬁeld changes reported by Wang (2006) and Petrie (2012).
Here the changes in the horizontal magnetic ﬂux have been found to be persistent
up to more than two hours after the peak time of each ﬂare. These permanent
changes ensure that the temporal evolution of the horizontal magnetic ﬂux was
real and did not include any ﬂare-related artifact, as the ﬂare-related artifacts
are transient in nature and do not cause any permanent changes in the temporal
proﬁle of the measured magnetic ﬁeld (Sun et al., 2017). Figure 5 shows the
temporal evolution of the horizontal magnetic ﬂux for the non-eruptive ﬂares.
Error bars in the horizontal magnetic ﬂux were too small (≈ 10−3 times the
calculated values) to be plotted. The change in horizontal magnetic ﬂux has
been found to range between 3×1020 and 7×1020 Mx within less than half an
hour for the four non-eruptive ﬂares. In percentage terms, these changes range
from about 2 % to 10 % from its initial value in the pre-ﬂare stage.

and negative ﬂux (Figure 7) show that there was no signiﬁcant ﬂux cancellation
along the PIL associated with the conﬁned ﬂares. Importantly, the absence of
photospheric-ﬂux cancellation underlying the post-ﬂare loops associated with
the non-eruptive ﬂares conﬁrms that there were no converging motions of the
foot points of opposite magnetic polarities which can result in photospheric
foot-point reconnection along the PIL to form the ﬂux rope. These observations
support the idea of tether-cutting reconnection reported by Chen et al. (2015)
and Jiang et al. (2016). They considered the shearing motion of the photospheric
ﬂuxes to be responsible for stressing the coronal magnetic ﬁeld and building up
a large current sheet that triggered the magnetic reconnection and produced the
homologous high energetic ﬂares.

The Lorentz-force changes for the non-eruptive ﬂares have been illustrated in
Figure 8. During each of the ﬂares, the radial component of the Lorentz force
underwent a large and abrupt downward change. The magnitude of these force
changes, ranging from about 2.0×1022 dyne to 2.6 × 1022 dyne, are comparable
to those found in the previous estimates of ﬂare-related Lorentz-force changes
(Petrie, 2012; Wang, Liu, and Wang, 2012). For the four non-eruptive ﬂares, the
change in Lorentz force per unit area ranges from about 390 dyne cm−2 to 1390
dyne cm−2.

this case, the increment in the horizontal magnetic ﬂux (Figure 10) was about
1×1020 Mx. Importantly, the change in horizontal magnetic ﬂux for this eruptive
ﬂare was about 30 % from its initial value in the pre-ﬂare stage, whereas those
changes for the conﬁned ﬂares range from about 2 % to 10 %. Similar to the non-
eruptive ﬂares, no signiﬁcant changes in the vertical component of the magnetic
ﬁeld (upper-right panel of Figure 10) have been found for this ﬂare within the
selected region shown by the green boundary in the right panel of Figure 9.

The change in Lorentz force during this eruptive ﬂare was about 0.3×1022
dyne (Figure 10). Noticeably, the change in Lorentz force per unit area for this
case was about 4040 dyne cm−2, which is almost three times larger than the
maximum change found in the four non-eruptive cases. Also, the change in mean
horizontal magnetic ﬁeld during the eruptive ﬂare has been found to be about
135 Gauss, whereas in the conﬁned ﬂares it ranges from about 15 to 35 Gauss
only.

the largest active region of Solar Cycle 24. From 24 October, both the umbral
and penumbral area (Figure 3 in Sarkar, Srivastava, and Dhara, 2017) of AR
12192 decayed gradually from its maximum value. The morphological changes
of AR 12192 due to this gradual decay of penumbral area are shown in Figure
2, as observed in the high-resolution (0.2 arcsecond) images obtained by MAST.
MAST G-band images for four diﬀerent days (Figure 2) reveal the signiﬁcant
penumbral decay near the core region (marked by black arrows in Figure 2) of
AR 12192 where all of the high energetic X-class ﬂares took place.

Besides the gradual change, we have also found ﬂare-related abrupt penumbral
area decay away from the PIL of the source region of eruptive M4.0-class ﬂare
on 24 October 2014. The region of rapid penumbral area decay is illustrated in
Figure 12. The blue box in the upper panels shows the bounded region within
which the maximum change in penumbral area is observed. The temporal proﬁle
of integrated normalized intensity (panel [e] of Figure 12) calculated within the
bounded box exhibits a permanent increment after the ﬂare, suggesting the
permanent disappearance of the penumbral area after the ﬂare. Importantly,
this rapid decay in penumbral area was associated with the permanent decay

in horizontal magnetic ﬁeld within the same region. The mean horizontal mag-
netic ﬁeld, calculated within the bounded box shown in Figure 12, decreased
permanently by almost half of its initial value from about 600 Gauss to 300
Gauss (panel [e] of Figure 12) within less than half an hour during this eruptive
ﬂare. This scenario is consistent with the earlier ﬁnding of ﬂare-related rapid
penumbral decay away from the PIL and the associated permanent decrease in
horizontal magnetic ﬁeld (Xu et al., 2016). To further quantify this ﬂare-related
penumbral area decay, the time evolution of the penumbral area variation is
illustrated in Figure 13. The penumbral area is calculated for the contoured
sunspot (upper-panel of Figure 13), which was the source region of the eruptive
ﬂare. The white and blue contours in the ﬁgure mark the umbra–penumbra and
penumbra–quiet-Sun boundaries, which are determined by using the normalized
intensity thresholds calculated from the cumulative intensity histogram (Figure
4). Noticeably, the temporal proﬁle of penumbral area (lower panel of Figure
13) exhibits a permanent decrement from about 140 to 80 Mm2 within less than
half an hour during the ﬂare.

3.4. Comparison of Overlying Magnetic-Field Strength for Both the

Eruptive and Non-Eruptive Region

All of the non-eruptive high energetic ﬂares occurred in the core region of AR
12192 (Figure 3). However, the eruptive ﬂare occurred away from the core region
(Figure 14 a,b). From the study of extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld, we have found
that the overlying magnetic-ﬁeld strengths were diﬀerent for the eruptive and
non-eruptive ﬂaring regions.

In order to quantify the overlying magnetic-ﬁeld strength, we have calculated
the decay index over the whole AR. To compare the decay-index proﬁle for both
the eruptive and non-eruptive region of AR 12192, two 2D proﬁles of decay
index are plotted in Figure 14, where one of them is along the main PIL of
the core region, which was the non-eruptive zone, and the other one is over the
source region of the eruptive ﬂare, which occurred away from the core region.
Interestingly, the two decay index proﬁles show diﬀerent depths in the contour
drawn for 1.5 value, which is believed to be the critical decay index for the onset
of the torus instability. The critical decay index was achieved at a height about
52 Mm over the non-eruptive core region of AR 12192, whereas the decay index
decreased to the critical value (1.5) at height 35 Mm over the eruptive region.
This means that the external magnetic ﬁeld decays faster over the erupting
region than the non-eruptive one. This result further suggests that the strength
of the overlying magnetic ﬁeld plays a decisive role in determining whether the
AR will be CME-productive or not.

4. Summary and Conclusion

Table 2 summarizes our results based on a comparative study of the eruptive and
non-eruptive ﬂares produced by the largest AR of Solar Cycle 24 : AR 12192.

By comparing the magnetic characteristics for both the eruptive and non-
eruptive ﬂares, we conclude that the eruptive ﬂare left a signiﬁcant magnetic im-
print on the solar photosphere, whereas the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld changes
were comparatively small in the case of the conﬁned ﬂares. In contrast to the
eruptive ﬂare, the conﬁned ﬂares exhibited very weak changes in horizontal
magnetic-ﬁeld and Lorentz force per unit area (Table 2). This scenario is consis-
tent with the ﬂare-related momentum balance condition where the Lorentz-force
impulse is believed to be proportional to the associated CME momentum (Fisher
et al., 2012; Wang, Liu, and Wang, 2012). Thus, if a ﬂare is not associated with
a CME then the Lorentz-force impulse during that conﬁned ﬂare is expected
to be smaller. Our results from the analysis of selected four non-eruptive ﬂares
are in agreement with this expectation. All of the ﬁve ﬂares of our dataset
showed abrupt and permanent changes in photospheric magnetic ﬁeld, which is
a common feature in large ﬂares (Wang et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012). However,
the results presented in the current article suggest the changes to be larger in
magnitude for the eruptive ﬂares in comparison to the conﬁned ones. Therefore,
the ﬂare-related temporal changes in magnitude of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld
and Lorentz-force impulse appeared to be well correlated with the nature of
eruptions. The weak changes in the magnetic characteristics during the four
non-eruptive ﬂares support the earlier results of Sun et al. (2015) where they
compared the photospheric changes during one non-eruptive X3.1-class ﬂare
produced by AR 12192 with those during two eruptive X5.4 and X2.2-class ﬂares
produced by diﬀerent ARs, i.e. AR 11429 and AR 11158 respectively. However,
we have followed a diﬀerent approach where we compared the photospheric
magnetic environments of the four highly energetic non-eruptive ﬂares with those

for the eruptive ﬂare originated from the same AR (AR 12192). Therefore, our
analysis is free from the bias of other factors, such as the scale size and complexity
of the diﬀerent ARs, which are believed to play important role in the eruptions.
The signiﬁcant growth in the AR area is reﬂected in the magnetic energy
content of AR 12192, as it produced six highly energetic X-class ﬂares within an
interval of one to two days during its disc passage. This implies that the huge size
of AR 12192 may be responsible for its energy storage being suﬃcient to trigger
the recurrent highly energetic ﬂares. The rapid penumbral-area decay observed
during the eruptive M4.0-class ﬂare reveals how the strong Lorentz force impulse
can shape the dynamics of the solar eruptions and cause morphological changes
in the photospheric features. The physical explanation behind these ﬂare-related
photospheric morphological changes is given in Xu et al. (2016). They showed
that during the ﬂare, due to the magnetic-pressure imbalance between the recon-
nection site and the outer atmosphere, the Lorentz force away from the PIL acts
in the upward direction to lift up the magnetic ﬁeld lines from the outer higher
magnetic-pressure region towards the reconnection site. Therefore, away from the
PIL the more horizontal ﬁeld lines in the preﬂare stage become more vertical
after the ﬂare and release the magnetic pressure due to the upward impulse of the
Lorentz force, resulting in a decrement in horizontal magnetic-ﬁeld strength and
disappearance of penumbral area. However, in the case of the non-eruptive ﬂares
we did not ﬁnd any noticeable ﬂare-related permanent and abrupt changes in

SOLA: sarkar.tex; 3 January 2018; 1:29; p. 21

R.Sarkar, N.Srivastava

the umbral or penumbral area. The presence of weak Lorentz-force impulse and
diﬀerent restructuring in the magnetic-ﬁeld topology in the conﬁned ﬂares may
be attributed to the insigniﬁcant morphological changes found in those cases.

Comparison of the overlying coronal magnetic ﬁeld environment in the pre-
ﬂare stages reveals that the gradient of overlying magnetic-ﬁeld strength decayed
faster over the eruptive region of AR 12192 as compared to that over the non-
eruptive zone, suggesting the overlying ﬁeld strength was stronger over the non-
eruptive core area of the AR than the eruptive zone. This result is similar to
the earlier ﬁnding by Cheng et al. (2011) where they did a comparative study
of the critical decay index (1.5) height for the onset of the torus instability over
both the eruptive and non-eruptive regions belonging to same AR (NOAA AR
10720). Although our study suggests the importance of the background magnetic
ﬁeld strength for the conﬁned behavior of the non-eruptive ﬂares, a recent study
(Zhang, Li, and Chen, 2017) reveals that the complex ﬂare loops associated with
the non-eruptive ﬂares originating from AR 12192 may also be responsible for
the conﬁnement.

In short, our comparative study of both the eruptive and non-eruptive ﬂares
produced from AR 12192 suggests that, although the ﬂare-related permanent
and abrupt changes in photospheric magnetic ﬁeld and Lorentz forces are a
common feature in large ﬂares, the magnitude of those changes is smaller in
the case of the conﬁned ﬂares compared to the eruptive ones. We conclude that
the highly energetic ﬂares leave a magnetic imprint on the solar photosphere
that carries information on the nature of eruption. In addition, the comparative
study of overlying coronal magnetic ﬁeld environments for both the conﬁned and
eruptive ﬂares reveal that the decay rate of the overlying magnetic-ﬁeld strength
can be used as a key parameter to determine the CME productivity of the AR.
Nevertheless, our analysis is limited to a small number of events. In the future,
we plan to extend our work to several conﬁned and eruptive events using the
newly available high cadence (135 seconds) HMI vector magnetic-ﬁeld data.
