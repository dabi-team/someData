Abstract: Fermion dark matter particles can aggregate to form extended dark mat-
ter structures via a ﬁrst-order phase transition in which the particles get trapped in
the false vacuum. We study Fermi balls created in a phase transition induced by a
generic quartic thermal eﬀective potential. We show that for Fermi balls of mass, 3 ×
10−12M(cid:12) <∼ MFB <∼ 10−5M(cid:12), correlated observations of gravitational waves produced dur-
ing the phase transition (at SKA/THEIA/µAres), and gravitational microlensing caused
by Fermi balls (at Subaru-HSC), can be made.

1 Introduction

The identity of dark matter (DM) is a long-standing puzzle in particle physics, astrophysics
and cosmology. Weakly interacting massive particles are popular DM candidates that
attain the measured DM relic density through thermal freeze-out, and typically have masses
of O(10 − 103) GeV and weak scale annihilation cross sections. However, no convincing
evidence of these particles has been found over several decades of experimentation.

Recently, a paradigm-altering connection between DM and ﬁrst-order phase transitions
(FOPTs) in early universe has garnered attention. In the Standard Model (SM), both the
electroweak and quantum chromodynamics phase transitions are smooth crossovers, so the
FOPT must occur in a dark sector. In this work, we consider a scenario in which a quartic
thermal eﬀective potential gives rise to a FOPT, and a Yukawa interaction with fermion
DM generates a nonzero DM mass in the true vacuum, whereas the DM particle remains
massless in the false vacuum. If the DM mass in the true vacuum is larger than the critical
temperature of the FOPT, then, four-momentum conservation causes the DM to be trapped
in the false vacuum. If a DM-antiDM asymmetry exists, then as the false vacuum shrinks,
the DM particles are compressed to form macroscopic objects called Fermi balls (FBs),
which become the DM relic [1]. Similar ideas have been proposed in Refs. [2, 3].

In this paper, we study FBs produced in a FOPT generated by a general quartic
thermal potential. Our focus is the mass range of FBs for which gravitational wave and
microlensing signals can be correlated. The Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) sky survey
has observed about 100 million stars in the M31 galaxy in an observation time of 7 hours,
and plans for a 70 hour observation period are underway [4]. As a FB passes between a star
in M31 and the Earth, the transient brightening of the star by gravitational micolensing can

be detected by Subaru-HSC. Also, future telescopes like SKA [5], THEIA [6] and µAres [7]
will have the ability to detect gravitational waves from the FOPT that produced the FBs.
This paper is organized as follows. We investigate the formation and properties of FBs
in section 2. In section 3, we compute the microlensing event rate for several benchmark
points, and the sensitivity of the Subaru-HSC survey for the case of extended sources and
lenses. In section 4, we calculate the gravitational wave spectra expected from the FOPT
for our benchmark points. Finally, we summarize in section 5.

2 Fermi ball formation

We consider a scenario in which the dark sector only couples to the SM sector gravitation-
ally. The model is composed of a dark Dirac fermion χ, a dark scalar φ, and their Yukawa
interaction:

L ⊃ ¯χi /∂χ − gχφ ¯χχ − Veﬀ (φ, T ) ,

(2.1)

where the last term is the ﬁnite-temperature eﬀective potential of φ that induces the
FOPT in the early universe. When the temperature drops below the critical temperature
Tc, the universe starts to traverse from the false vacuum ((cid:104)φ(cid:105) = 0) to the true vacuum
((cid:104)φ(cid:105) = vφ). The interaction term φ ¯χχ in the Lagrangian implies the χ is massless in the
false vacuum, and obtains mass mχ (cid:39) gχvφ in the true vacuum. For χ to acquire mass
in the true vacuum, energy conservation dictates that χ in the false vacuum have enough
kinetic energy to penetrate the bubble wall during the FOPT. Conversely, if

mχ (cid:39) gφvφ (cid:29) Tc ,

(2.2)

the χ’s will be trapped inside the false vacuum. As the true vacuum expands and the false
vacuum shrinks, the χ’s aggregate and form a macroscopic FB. For this to occur, there
must be a nonzero asymmetry ηχ ≡ (nχ −n ¯χ)/s in the number densities in the false vacuum
(where s is the entropy density) during the phase transition so that an excess remains after
pair annihilation ¯χχ → φφ, and χ must carry a conserved global U (1)Q so that the FB
attains stability by accumulating Q-charge [1]. Mechanisms that produce ηχ are discussed
in the appendix of Ref. [1].

2.1 Eﬀective potential

We consider the ﬁnite-temperature quartic eﬀective potential [8, 9],

Veﬀ (φ, T ) = D(T 2 − T 2

(2.3)

where T0 is the destabilization temperature, C contributes a zero-temperature cubic term,
and D, A, and λ are dimensionless parameters. Potentials of this form are commonly
found in particle physics including inert singlet, inert doublet, minimal supersymmetry,

Therefore, B is the diﬀerence in vacuum energy density between the φ = 0 and ˜φ+ phases,
and will make an important contribution to the latent heat released during the FOPT. In
terms of the input parameters,

λ, A, B, C, D ,

T0 is a derived quantity. We show an example of the ﬁnite-temperature potential in the left
panel of Fig. 1, where the critical temperature is deﬁned by Veﬀ (0, Tc) = Veﬀ (vφ(Tc), Tc).

The eﬀective number of extra neutrino species contributed by the dark sector after the
phase transition, ∆Neﬀ , depends sensitively on Tf /TSM(cid:63). For example, for temperatures
below 60 keV, gSM
∗ (cid:39) 3.36, and ∆Neﬀ (cid:39) 9.9(Tf /TSM(cid:63))4. The 95% C.L. upper bound
from a combination of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations and Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) measurements that uses the primordial helium abundance of
Ref. [10] is ∆Neﬀ < 0.55 [11]. Also, the Hubble tension suggests that at recombination
∆Neﬀ is in the range 0.4 − 1 [12]. A robust 95% C.L. upper bound from BBN alone
is ∆Neﬀ < 1 [13]. Absent knowledge of the reheating process after inﬂation, we select
benchmark points with values of Tf /TSM(cid:63) that give ∆Neﬀ ≤ 0.5.

We identify T(cid:63) with the temperature of percolation, i.e., the temperature at which the
fraction of space remaining in the false vacuum is 1/e. Then T(cid:63) and the corresponding
time t(cid:63) are given by the condition,

F (t(cid:63)) = 1/e (cid:39) 0.37 .

(2.15)

We also take t(cid:63) to be the time when FBs form.

For phase transitions much shorter than the Hubble time, the inverse duration of the

phase transition is

In addition to this parameter, the GW spectrum depends on the strength of the phase
transition,

α ≡

(cid:15)(T(cid:63))
ρ(T(cid:63))

.

(2.18)

Because the fraction of latent heat converted to GWs is determined by the dynamics in
the dark sector (and is not related to α) [14], we can assume it is unity.

2.2 Number density and density proﬁle of Fermi balls

FBs start to form at T(cid:63) in the false vacuum, as it shrinks and separates into smaller volumes.
Below a critical volume of the false vacuum bubble, V(cid:63) = 4πR3
(cid:63)/3, bubble nucleation of the
true vacuum stops and the formation of FBs takes over. Since the timescale on which
the false vacuum bubble shrinks is ∆t = R(cid:63)/vw, V(cid:63) is given by Γ(T(cid:63))V(cid:63)∆t ∼ 1. Then,
with one FB per critical volume, the number density of FBs nFB|T(cid:63) is determined by
nFB|T(cid:63)V(cid:63) = F (t(cid:63)), i.e., [1]:

(2.19)

(2.20)

which is equivalent to the total number of χ that form a FB. We assume all the χ’s are
trapped in the false vacuum and cannot penetrate the bubble wall due to its large mass in
the true vacuum. The χ-asymmetry ηχ is a free parameter that must be tuned to produce
the measured DM relic density. Because the universe evolves adiabatically, nFB/s and QFB
remain unchanged, and today,

Here, g∗s is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom for the entropy density, and
gD
∗s = 4.5 at all relevant times. The dark sector contribution to the entropy density is
signiﬁcantly suppressed compared to that of the SM sector.

To ﬁnd the density proﬁle of FBs we need to solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ

(TOV) equation [15]. The energy of a FB is [1]

where the ﬁrst term is the Fermi-gas pressure of χ in a FB, σ0 is the surface tension, and
B = Veﬀ (0, 0) − Veﬀ (vφ, 0). Thus the energy density becomes

(2.24)

(2.25)

Using this relation, we obtain the density proﬁle of the FB by solving the TOV equation
with a boundary condition for the pressure at the center of the FB, P |R=0. The result
is shown in Fig. 2 for three values of P |R=0. (In comparison, the pressure at the center
of the sun is 1.27 × 10−21 GeV4.) From the bottom-right panel, we see that the FB has
a uniform density proﬁle. This is because the constant B-dependent term in Eq. (2.23)
dominates the total energy. The correlation between MFB and RFB obtained by varying
P |R=0 is displayed in Fig. 3.

The mass MFB and radius RFB of a FB are obtained by minimizing the FB energy

with respect to its radius [1]:

larger, MFB gets smaller, in apparent contradiction with Eq. (2.26). The reason for this is
as follows. Using the saddle point approximation to perform the integral in Eq. (2.11), the

Because β/H(cid:63) is roughly constant for ﬁxed values of λ, A, and D (see Table 1), we ﬁnd
β ∝ H(cid:63) ∝ T 2

(cid:63) . Combining with Eq. (2.28), we obtain

i.e.,

e−S3(T(cid:63))/T(cid:63) ∝ B ,

(2.29)

which is not surprising since the bubble nucleation rate per unit volume should grow with
the available vacuum energy density. From Eq. (2.19), nFB|0 ∝ e−3/4·(S3(T(cid:63))/T(cid:63)), so for a
ﬁxed value of ΩFBh2, we see that MFB ∝ 1/nFB|0 ∝ e3/4·(S3(T(cid:63))/T(cid:63)) ∝ B−3/4.

3 Gravitational microlensing

If a gravitational lens, i.e., FB, passes along the line of sight of a background source star,
the star will appear to brighten and subsequently dim, thereby providing the characteristic
signature of microlensing. Microlensing surveys put strong constraints on macroscopic
dark matter candidates including FBs. Subaru-HSC [4] has surveyed over 8.7 × 107 stars
in the M31 galaxy, which is 770 kpc away from our galactic center [4]. In the seven hours
of observation, only one event of transient brightening was detected. Other surveys like
EROS/MACHO [17] and OGLE [18], are sensitive to gravitational lenses with masses and
radii larger than relevant to us.

(3.1)

and the Einstein angle is θE = RE/DL. Here, G is the gravitational constant, MFB is
the mass of the lens, DS is the distance from the Earth to the source, DL is the distance
from the Earth to the lens, DLS = DS − DL, and x ≡ DL/DS. Equation. (3.1) often
gives RE (cid:39) O(R(cid:12)) (e.g., for benchmark point BP-1), which is comparable to RFB and
the source sizes in M31. Therefore, we need to account for the ﬁnite size of the lenses and
sources.

We brieﬂy outline the procedure of Ref. [19] which models microlensing signals from
spherically symmetric extended sources by spherically symmetric extended lenses. Assum-
ing DS, DL (cid:29) RE, lensing takes place in the transverse plane containing the lens, so it is
convenient to describe the geometry in this plane. With distances in units of RE, the ﬁnite
source of radius RS has a projected radius rS ≡ xRS/RE, and the distance between the
lens center and a point on the limb of the source is

¯u(ϕ) =

(cid:113)

u2 + r2

S + 2urS cos ϕ ,

(3.2)

where u is the distance between the lens and source centers, and ϕ is the angular position
of the point on the limb measured from the center of the source. For the uniform density
proﬁle of a FB,

ρFB(R) =

MFB

4πR3

FB/3

Θ(R − RFB) ,

(3.3)

the angular position of the image tϕ (in units of θE) of the point labelled by ϕ is determined
by solving the lensing equation [19, 20],

¯u(ϕ) =

(3.4)

where rFB ≡ RFB/RE.

For each ϕ corresponding to a point on the limb, Eq. (3.4) yields the positions of the
(usually one to two) images at tϕ,i. Neglecting limb darkening, the magniﬁcation of each
image is the ratio of the area of the image to the area of the source in the lens plane [19, 21]:

where we have emphasized the dependence on u. Note that the magniﬁcations of images
with opposite parities cancel. By convention, transient brightening is deﬁned as a mi-
crolensing event if µtot ≥ 1.34. This threshold corresponds to magniﬁcation by a point-like
lens of a point-like source separated by RE, i.e, u = 1.
The threshold impact parameter u1.34 is deﬁned as

µtot(u ≤ u1.34) ≥ 1.34 ,

(3.7)

so that the magniﬁcation is above threshold for all smaller impact parameters. Clearly, for
a point-like lens and point-like source, u1.34 = 1. For the FB density proﬁle, u1.34 is shown
in Fig. 4, where R90 ≡ (0.9)1/3RFB is the radius within which 90% of the total mass of the
FB is enclosed.

where NS = 8.7 × 107 is the number of stars in the survey and Tobs = 7 hrs is the total

requiring Nevents ≤ 4.74, corresponding to the one observed event at Subaru. According to
the left-panel of Fig. 5, in the point-like lens limit R90 (cid:28) R(cid:12), current Subaru-HSC data
constrain FBs with 10−11M(cid:12) (cid:46) MFB (cid:46) 10−5M(cid:12).

Subaru-HSC plans to monitor M31 for 10 times the current observation period: Tobs =
10 × 7 hrs [4]. Assuming that the observed number of events is proportional to the period
of observation, i.e., that 10 events are observed, and the detection eﬃciency is 50%, we
estimate the 95% C.L. sensitivity by requiring Nevents ≤ 16.96; see the right-panel of Fig. 5.

The gravitational wave power spectra for the benchmark points in Table 1 labeled in
order of increasing peak frequency.

4 Gravitational waves

These benchmark points also provide gravitational wave signals because of the FOPT.
Other than our assumption that the conversion of latent heat to GWs is fully eﬃcient,
we follow the procedure used in Ref. [26], which relies on the semi-analytic treatment in
Refs. [27–29]. The GW power spectra are shown in Fig. 6. THEIA is sensitive to all
benchmarks points except BP-8, which can be detected by µAres.

To study the complementarity and correlation between microlensing and GW signals,
we perform a parameter scan in the ranges, 0.05 ≤ λ ≤ 0.2, 1 ≤ B1/4/keV ≤ 2 × 103,
0.01 ≤ C/keV ≤ 10, 0.01 ≤ D ≤ 10, and 0.3 ≤ T(cid:63)/TSM(cid:63) ≤ 0.6. We ﬁx A = 0.1, which
avoids supercooling and gives values of S3/T for which a FOPT occurs. For B1/4 < 1 keV,
the GW spectra have peak frequencies below the sensitivity of SKA/THEIA; see Fig. 6.
For B1/4 > 103 keV, microlensing cannot be observed because MFB/M(cid:12) (cid:46) O(10−13); see
Fig. 5. The parameters must satisfy the condition that Tc be real: λD ≥ A2 − (C/T0)2 [30].
Note that the benchmark points in Table 1 are selected from this scan.

In Fig. 7, the green regions of the parameter space are only probed by GW experiments
because the FBs are too heavy to produce suﬃciently many lensing events. In the yellow
regions GW signals go undetected for frequencies with reduced THEIA and µAres sensi-
tivity, but microlensing observations provide a complementary probe. In the red regions,
both GW and microlensing signatures of FBs are detectable with existing and planned
experiments. The vertical edges of the red region in the lower left panel correspond to the
values of MFB/M(cid:12) in the right panel of Fig. 5 at which all sensitivity to microlensing is
lost. As conﬁrmed by Fig. 7, to obtain large GW signals with α >∼ 0.1, ∆Neﬀ needs to be
larger than about unity, which conﬂicts with constraints from BBN.

5 Summary

We investigated macroscopic dark matter in the form of Fermi balls produced in a ﬁrst-
order phase transition in the early universe. We considered a generic model in which a dark
fermion couples to a dark scalar, whose thermal eﬀective potential causes a FOPT. We ﬁnd
that FBs can be produced with a wide range of masses, 10−13M(cid:12) (cid:46) MFB (cid:46) 10−3M(cid:12), and
radii 10−6R(cid:12) (cid:46) RFB (cid:46) 10R(cid:12) for a vacuum energy scale O(1) (cid:46) B1/4/keV (cid:46) O(103) .

FBs behave as gravitational lenses and induce microlensing signals. Current data from
the Subaru-HSC survey of M31 constrain the fraction of dark matter composed of FBs,
and future data from 10 nights of observation will improve the sensitivity considerably; see
Fig. 5.

Gravitational waves created during the FOPT that produced FBs are also detectable.
Under the assumption that the temperature of the dark sector after the FOPT is such that
∆Neﬀ ∼ 0.1, a correlation in the GW signal and the microlensing event rate can be found
using SKA, THEIA, µAres and Subaru-HSC data for 3 × 10−12M(cid:12) <∼ MFB <∼ 10−5M(cid:12); see
Fig. 7. For FBs heavier than 10−5M(cid:12), the number of microlensing events above threshold
magniﬁcation is too low, and gravitational waves provide a complementary signal.
