The observation of multi-particle azimuthal correlations in high-energy small-system collisions
has led to intense debate on its origin and the possible coexistence from two competing theoretical
scenarios: one based on initial-state intrinsic momentum anisotropy (ISM), and the other based on
ﬁnal-state collective response to the collision geometry (FSM). To complement the previous scan
of asymmetric collision systems (p+Au, d+Au and He+Au), we propose a scan of small symmetric
sNN = 0.2 TeV, to provide
collision systems at RHIC, such as C+C, O+O, Al+Al and Ar+Ar
further insights in disentangling contributions from these two scenarios. These symmetric small sys-
tems have the advantage of providing a better controlled initial geometry dominated by the average
shape of the overlap region, as opposed to ﬂuctuation-driven geometries in asymmetric systems. A
transport model is employed to investigate the expected geometry response in the FSM scenario.
Diﬀerent trends of elliptic ﬂow with increasing charge particle multiplicity are observed between
symmetric and asymmetric systems, while triangular ﬂow appears to show a similar behavior. Fur-

In high-energy proton-proton (pp), proton-nucleus
(p+A) and nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions, particle
correlations are important tools to study multi-parton
dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the
strongly-coupled, non-perturbative regime [1]. Measure-
ments of azimuthal correlations reveal a strong har-
monic modulation of particle densities dN /dφ ∝ 1 +
2 ∑∞
n=1 vn cos n(φ − Φn) [2–4], where vn and Φn represent
the magnitude and phase of the nth-order harmonic, and
are often denoted by ﬂow vector Vn = vneinΦn . The az-
imuthal correlations are found to be collective, involving
many particles over a wide pseudorapidity range. The
collectivity in A+A collisions is successfully described
as a hydrodynamic response of the produced system
to shape ﬂuctuations in the initial state [5]. However,
such interpretation is challenged in small-system colli-
sions such as pp and p+A, where the small size and
short lifetime might prevent the system to thermalize
and evolve hydrodynamically. Instead, collectivity aris-
ing either from initial momentum correlation [4] or via a
few scatterings among partons (without hydrodynamiza-
tion) [6–8] has been proposed as alternative source of
collectivity in small systems. Lots of experimental and
theoretical eﬀorts have been devoted to the study of col-
lectivity in small-system collisions, with the goal of un-
derstanding the time-scale and origin for the emergence
of collectivity and the mechanism for early-time thermal-
ization in large collision systems.

One key feature that distinguishes initial momentum
correlation models (ISM) from ﬁnal-state interaction
models (FSM, including hydrodynamics or a few scat-
terings, denoted as FSM-hydro or FSM-tran.) is the re-
lation between the initial-state geometry and ﬁnal-state
collectivity [9]. In FSM, the collectivity is a geometrical
response to initial shape ﬂuctuations, i.e. vn is approxi-

mately proportional to the nth-order initial-state eccen-
tricity εn [10]. In ISM, such geometrical response is ex-
pected to be absent [11]. One idea to distinguish these
two scenarios is to perform a geometry scan by colliding
systems with diﬀerent spacial eccentricities and see if the
measured vn is correlated with the change of εn between
diﬀerent systems [12].

Several studies of elliptic ﬂow (v2) and triangular ﬂow
(v3) based on such geometry scan have been performed
at RHIC with p+Au, d+Au and 3He+Au [13–17].
In
high-multiplicity events, the ε2 was predicted to be larger
than in p+Au while the ε3 is comparable [12]. Therefore,
a similar hierarchy is expected for v2 and v3 in FSM, as
observed experimentally [14]. However, ISM based on
a particular implementation of gluon saturation physics
could produce large momentum anisotropy in these sys-
tems [11]. The situation is more challenging in the un-
derstanding of collectivity involving heavy quarks, such
as D meson or J/Ψ in p+Pb collisions [18–20]: FSM
presently signiﬁcantly underestimates the v2 for D and
J/Ψ [21], while an ISM-based approach is able to de-
scribe the data [22]. The relative contribution of FSM vs.
ISM for the vn data in small systems is an area of intense
ongoing debate [23, 24]. Even in FSM, there are uncer-
tainties in modeling the initial-state geometry due to dif-
ferent treatments of subnucleonic ﬂuctuations, which are
expected to play an important role especially in small
asymmetric systems. Furturemore, experimental stud-
ies from previous p/d/3He+Au scan at RHIC were lim-
ited by detector capabilities: 1) most measurements were
based on two-particle correlations with incomplete un-
derstanding of non-ﬂow systematics (e.g., results depend
strongly on the non-ﬂow estimation method), 2) the na-
ture of longitudinal decorrelations of collectivity and its
eﬀects on the measurements were poorly understood, 3) a

 
 
 
 
 
 
large class of multi-particle observables, demonstrated to
be very insightful at the LHC [25], were only partially ex-
plored (multi-particle v2 has been measured in d+Au [26]
but without pT diﬀerential information).

In this paper, an extended scan of small-system colli-
sions at RHIC is proposed, taking advantage of the newly
completed detector upgrades at STAR and future detec-
tor capabilities at STAR/sPHENIX (A case at LHC is
studied in Ref. [27] for a few collision species). We note
that RHIC and LHC have collided many systems, but
there is a large gap between the largest small system
3He+Au and smallest large system Cu+Cu. We pro-
pose additional system scans to ﬁll the gap between pp
and Cu+Cu, in particular symmetric collision systems
such as C+C, O+O, Al+Al, Ar+Ar. Since the system
created in Cu+Cu collisions clearly exhibits ﬁnal-state
eﬀects associated with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP),
such as collective ﬂow [28, 29] and jet quenching [30, 31],
a scan of smaller symmetric systems could help to es-
tablish at which system size initial-state eﬀects become
subdominant compared to ﬁnal-state eﬀects, as well as
provide important level-arm to disentangle between the
two ﬁnal-state scenarios: FSM-hydro vs FSM-tran. Fur-
thermore, the role of ε2 and ε3 in small A+A systems
are very diﬀerent from those in p/d/3He+Au:
the ε2
has a signiﬁcant average geometry component in small
A+A systems, while it is dominated by ﬂuctuations in
p/d/3He+Au systems. Therefore, diﬀerent centrality de-
pendence of v2 is expected for symmetric and asymmet-
ric systems. As argued in Ref. [25], symmetric systems
also have better centrality resolution and therefore less
centrality bias compared to asymmetric systems, thanks
to a broader distribution in the number of participating
nucleons, Npart.

among these systems. For systems with approximately

expected to be less sensitive to experimental centrality

To estimate the behavior of geometry-driven ﬁnal-state
collectivity in these small symmetric systems, a multi-

2

phase transport model (AMPT) [32] is employed. The
AMPT model has been successful in describing many
features of collectivity in small- and large-system colli-
sions at RHIC and the LHC, over a wide range of nu-
cleus species and energies [33–36]. The AMPT starts
with Monte Carlo Glauber initial conditions. 1 The sys-
tem evolution is modeled with strings that ﬁrst melt into
partons, followed by elastic partonic scatterings, parton
coalescence, and hadronic scatterings. The collectivity is
generated mainly through elastic scatterings of partons,
which leads to an emission of partons preferable along
the gradient of the initial-state energy density distribu-
tion, in a manner that is similar to hydrodynamic ﬂow.
Following Refs [34, 35], we use the AMPT model v.2.25
with string-melting mode and hadronic rescatterings in-
cluded. The partonic cross section of 1.5 mb is used.
About 20 million AMPT events are generated for each
collision system at each energy.

We compute the eccentricity vector En = εneinΨn in
each event from initial-state coordinates (ri, φi) of par-
ticipant nucleons as

En = −

The phase of the eccentricity vector Ψn is known as the
participant plane (PP).

(2)

The harmonic ﬂow coeﬃcients v2 and v3 are calculated
for charged particles in 0.2 < pT < 3 GeV/c and ∣η∣ < 2.0
using two methods. In the PP method, the anisotropy
coeﬃcients vn are calculated from the φ angles of charged
hadrons relative to the Ψn, then averaged over events:
vn{PP} = ⟨cos n(φ − Ψn)⟩ .
This method has the advantage of avoiding correlations
from jets and resonance decays, since they are uncorre-
lated with the Ψn. It is used mainly to establish baseline
features of Nch dependence of vn without the complica-
tion of non-ﬂow. Since Ψn is not experimentally acces-
sible, and is generally diﬀerent from the event plane for
the ﬁnal-state particles, we also calculate vn using the
standard two-particle correlation (2PC) technique com-
monly employed in experimental measurements. In this
method, harmonic coeﬃcients are calculated from the rel-
ative azimuthal angle ∆φ = φi − φj of pairs of charged
particles as vn,n{2PC} = ⟨cos n(∆φ)⟩. A pseudorapidity
gap of ∣∆η∣ > 1.5 between the pairs is required to sup-
press short-range correlations. To suppress non-ﬂow cor-
relations from back-to-back jets, a peripheral subtraction
procedure, similar to that used in Ref. [37], is employed
to obtain the ﬁnal ﬂow coeﬃcients

pp and vn,n{2PC, pp} are the average
charged particle multiplicity and harmonic coeﬃcient
from pp collisions, respectively. This subtraction method
was shown to work reasonably well for pT-integrated cor-
relation measurement (but underestimate the ﬂow signal
for pT > 1 − 2 GeV/c) [38].

The vn{PP} and vn{2PC, sub} are calculated as a
function of centrality, which are determined based on ei-
ther Npart or the number of charged particles ⟨Nch⟩ in the
forward rapidity region 2.5 < ∣η∣ < 4.5. In each case, the
vn{PP} and vn{2PC, sub} are calculated in unit Npart or
⟨Nch⟩ bin and then averaged to obtain results in larger
centrality ranges.

Figure 2 shows the vn{PP} as a function of ⟨Nch⟩ in
four symmetric and three asymmetric small systems. For
symmetric systems, the v2{PP} values increase and then
decrease with increasing ⟨Nch⟩, and the peak positions
in ⟨Nch⟩ also increase slightly for larger systems. This
behavior has been observed in larger systems [29, 39–
42] and is consistent with the expectation that the ε2 is
driven by the average shape the overlap region [42]. The
v3{PP} values for diﬀerent symmetric systems tend to
follow a common increasing trend as a function of ⟨Nch⟩.
Similar observation has been made in Cu+Cu, Au+Au
and U+U collisions at RHIC [42], and in p+Pb and pe-
ripheral Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC [43, 44]. Based on
an independent source picture and a simple conformal
scaling argument [45], this scaling behavior is expected
since ε3 is driven by random ﬂuctuations of the positions
of participating nucleons.

FIG. 2. The v2{PP} (left) and v3{PP} (right) as a func-
tion of ⟨Nch⟩ in four symmetric and three asymmetric small
collision systems.

Figure 2 also shows that the v2{PP} values from asym-
metric systems follow diﬀerent trends: the v2{PP} in
d/4He+Au increase with ⟨Nch⟩, while it is relatively
constant in p+Au. The v3{PP} values show a simi-
lar ⟨Nch⟩ dependence as symmetric systems, except for
d+Au which deviates from the common trend at large
⟨Nch⟩. Therefore, in a ﬁnal-state driven model, we ex-
pected a clear diﬀerence between d/4He+Au and A+A
for v2, but relatively similar behavior for v3.

Figure 3 shows the same results for vn{2PC, sub}. The
overall trends are similar to vn{PP} in Fig. 2. The larger
values of vn{2PC, sub} are possibly due to contributions
from initial momentum anisotropy that may survive to

3

the ﬁnal state in small systems, as well as possible dy-
namical ﬂow ﬂuctuations generated by ﬁnal-state inter-
actions [46], both of which are uncorrelated with the PP.
Since a geometry response picture is absent for pure
initial momentum anisotropy models, several behaviors
of v2 discussed in Figs. 2 and 3 are not naturally ex-
including the ⟨Nch⟩ dependence and the dif-
pected,
ferences between asymmetric and symmetric systems.
Therefore, measurements of centrality dependence of v2
and v3 and comparison with large A+A systems at sim-
ilar ⟨Nch⟩ can provide strong constraints on whether the
observed anisotropy is dominated by initial- or ﬁnal-state
eﬀects.

In a recent yellow report for the future LHC heavy-ion
physics program, the possibility for smaller A+A colli-
sions is discussed [25]. This includes a possible 16O+16O
sNN = 2.76−7 TeV in 2022–2023, and other light-
run at
ion species such as Ar+Ar beyond 2028. The main argu-
ment for O+O run at the LHC is that it allows a better
control of Npart, εn and hard-scattering rate via number
of nucleon-nucleon collisions Ncoll [25]. An O+O run at
RHIC right after BES-II would provide an unprecedented
and timely comparison of the same small system at very
diﬀerent collision energies (0.2 TeV vs. 2.76–7 TeV). This
“RHIC-LHC energy scan” provides a unique opportunity
to study systems with nearly identical nucleon geome-
try but very diﬀerent subnucleon ﬂuctuations and parti-
cle production mechanism with diﬀerent saturation scale
and mini-jet productions in the initial state. The large
lever-arm in collision energy should provide new insights
on the onset behavior of collectivity, jet quenching, or
any other ﬁnal-state eﬀects in small systems: any model
has to describe results at both energies, which naturally
leads to better understandings of results at each energy.
The top panels of Fig. 4 compare the AMPT model
prediction of v2{PP} and v3{PP} as a function of Npart
in O+O collisions at 0.2 and 2.76 TeV. The vn{PP} val-
ues are larger at 2.76 TeV, but the shape of the Npart
dependence is rather similar between the two energies.

The bottom panels of Fig. 4 show vn{PP} as a func-
tion of ⟨Nch⟩. The results for 2.76 TeV span about a
factor of 2.5 larger ⟨Nch⟩ range than those for 0.2 TeV,
due to a larger multiplicity at a higher collision energy.

but the exact origin is not clear. However this observa-
tion is contested by a recent preliminary measurement
from the STAR Collaboration [53]. It would be vital to
sNN dependence for
see whether the strikingly diﬀerent
v2 and v3 in p+A collisions also persists in small A+A
systems such as O+O collisions between RHIC and LHC.

√

More interestingly, the shape of the ⟨Nch⟩ dependence
of v2{PP} is qualitatively diﬀerent from its Npart depen-
dence: v2 increases with ⟨Nch⟩, reaching a plateau, then
increases again towards higher ⟨Nch⟩. The increase at
larger ⟨Nch⟩ resembles the behavior of v3{PP} at large
⟨Nch⟩. To oﬀer a plausible explanation, we note that
the particle production depends on ﬂuctuations in Npart
and ﬂuctuation of number of partons within each par-
ticipant, and the higher-end of the p(Nch) distribution
at 2.76 TeV is dominated by the ﬂuctuation of particle
production in each participant. Due to this, the εn value
is nearly constant for ⟨Nch⟩ > 300 at 2.76 TeV (Figure
1 in supplementary materials), while it decreases con-
tinuously with ⟨Nch⟩ at 0.2 TeV. Since viscous damping
eﬀects are reduced for events with the same εn but higher
multiplicity, this leads to an increases of v2 with ⟨Nch⟩ at
2.76 TeV in AMPT.

FIG. 5.
Comparison of v2 and v3 between Pb+Pb
and Au+Au in 30–40% centrality (left) and between high-
multiplicity p+Pb and p+Au (right). The insert panel shows
the ratio of vn between p+Au and p+Pb.

The large gap between pp and Cu+Cu is one of the
last unexplored frontiers at RHIC [54] and now is the
best time to ﬁll it. Since the last RHIC p/d/He+Au
scan, the STAR experiment has completed several detec-
tor upgrades that extend pT and particle identiﬁcation
to ∣η∣ < 1.5, and provide centrality and event plane de-
termination in 2 < ∣η∣ < 5; An ongoing forward upgrade
to instrument 2.5 < η < 4 region with tracking detector
and calorimeter is expected to complete in 2021 [55]. A
one-week 200 GeV O+O run was recently proposed by
the STAR Collaboration for 2020 or 2021 [56], which is
expected to provide 400 million minimum bias events and
200 million 0–5% central events. This dataset would en-
able detailed measurements of multi-particle correlations
and rare particles such as φ meson with decent preci-
sion. A forward upgrade has also been planned for the
sPHENIX experiment [57]. The extended detector capa-
bility should allow a full exploration of collectivity using
all the observable and methods developed for large sys-
tems at RHIC/LHC. We will have much better control
of the non-ﬂow systematics, understanding the multi-
particle nature of the collectivity and the longitudinal
correlations to constrain the full 3D initial condition.

√

In summary, we propose a scan of small A+A systems
sNN = 200 GeV to understand
at RHIC top energy
the timescale for the emergence of collectivity and early
thermalization mechanisms in nucleus-nucleus collisions.
Comparing to asymmetric systems such as p/d/He+Au
with similar Npart, the symmetric systems have diﬀerent
initial geometry ﬂuctuations and less bias on the central-
ity selection. A scan of both symmetric and asymmetric
systems provide an opportunity to disentangle contribu-

To further motivate the synergy between RHIC and
LHC for small system scan program, Fig. 5 compares the
vn(pT) data for n = 2,3 at two energies in large A+A sys-
tem and p+A system. It is well-known that vn(pT) for
charged hadrons has very little
sNN dependence from
RHIC to LHC [47], as well as from 39 to 200 GeV at
RHIC [48, 49], this is conﬁrmed by the left panel which
compares the Pb+Pb [50] with Au+Au data [51] in 30–
40% centrality. However, a comparison of vn(pT) be-
tween p+Pb [52] and p+Au [14] central data suggests a
very diﬀerent story. The v2(pT) values are more or less
in agreement, but the v3 at RHIC is lower by more than
a factor of two and the relative diﬀerence show no appar-
ent pT dependence. In the FSM picture, this observation
suggests large change in the initial eccentricities or vis-
cosity damping eﬀects between the two collision energies,
