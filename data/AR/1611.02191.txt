ABSTRACT

Aims. We present a study of the Galactic supernova remnant SNR G15.9+0.2 with archival XMM-Newton observations.
Methods. EPIC data are used to investigate the morphological and spectral properties of the remnant, searching in particular for
supernova ejecta and Fe K line emission. By comparing the SNR’s X-ray absorption column density with the atomic and molecular
gas distribution along the line of sight, we attempt to constrain the distance to the SNR.
Results. Prominent line features reveal the presence of ejecta. Abundance ratios of Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca strongly suggest that the
progenitor of SNR G15.9+0.2 was a massive star with a main sequence mass likely in the range 20–25 M⊙, strengthening the physical
association with a candidate central compact object detected with Chandra. Using EPIC’s collective power, Fe K line emission from
SNR G15.9+0.2 is detected for the ﬁrst time. We measure the line properties and ﬁnd evidence for spatial variations. We discuss how
the source ﬁts within the sample of SNRs with detected Fe K emission and ﬁnd that it is the core-collapse SNR with the lowest Fe K
centroid energy. We also present some caveats regarding the use of Fe K line centroid energy as a typing tool for SNRs. Only a lower
limit of 5 kpc is placed on the distance to SNR G15.9+0.2, constraining its age to tS NR & 2 kyr.

1. Introduction

SNR G15.9+0.2 was discovered as a supernova remnant
(SNR) at radio wavelengths in Molonglo-Parkes observations
by Clark et al. (1973, 1975). Higher spatial resolution radio
observations with VLA revealed the elongated shell-like
structure of the SNR with a bright enhancement on the
eastern border (Dubner et al. 1996). The source is relatively
bright in X-rays, as found in Chandra data by Reynolds et al.
(2006b, hereafter R06).
Its X-ray morphology favours a
core-collapse (CC) origin according to Lopez et al. (2009,
2011). The SNR was detected in infrared with Spitzer/MIPS
by Pinheiro Gonçalves et al. (2011), who measured a dust
temperature and mass of 60 K and 8.1 × 10−2 M⊙, respectively.
Although 300 SNRs are now known in the Milky Way, SNR
G15.9+0.2 is an interesting target for an in-depth analysis for
several reasons. First, it is likely young, ∼ 103 yr according to
R06, as suggested by its small angular diameter and Chandra
X-ray analysis. This could add SNR G15.9+0.2 to the small
sample (about 15) of SNRs conﬁrmed to be . 2000 yr old
(using the compilation 1 of Ferrand & Saﬁ-Harb 2012) and thus
reduces the discrepancy between the observed and expected
numbers of young SNRs. Second, a compact source, identiﬁed
as CXOU J181852.0−150213, was discovered in the central
region of the SNR (R06) with X-ray properties typical of cen-
tral compact objects (CCOs, e.g. Pavlov et al. 2004). Recently,
deeper Chandra observations allowed Klochkov et al. (2016)
to conﬁrm that the central object is indeed a young cooling
low-magnetized neutron star. This adds SNR G15.9+0.2 to
the short list of seven SNRs hosting a conﬁrmed CCO and
as many hosting bona ﬁde candidates (Lazendic et al. 2005;

1 http://www.physics.umanitoba.ca/snr/SNRcat/

De Luca et al. 2006; de Luca 2008; Halpern & Gotthelf 2010;
Combi et al. 2010; Sánchez-Ayaso et al. 2012). Third, its young
age and plasma conditions should produce detectable Fe K
emission. This feature is a blend of lines from various Fe ions,
with a centroid energy at ∼ 6.4 keV for ionisation states lower
than Fe17+, and then progressing to ∼ 6.7 keV for ion charges up
to 24. The ionic fraction of iron, and thus the centroid energy of
the Fe K line, is chieﬂy governed by the ionisation timescale net,
where ne is the electron density and t the time since the plasma
was shocked. After analysing all SNRs observed with Suzaku,
Yamaguchi et al. (2014, hereafter Y14) detected Fe K emission
from 16 Galactic and seven LMC SNRs. They showed that the
Fe K centroid energy discriminates type Ia and CC SNRs, with
the former consistently in the lower end (∼ 6.4 keV) of the
ionisation range, and CC SNRs closer to 6.7 keV. They attributed
this to CC SNRs expanding into higher density environments
produced by the massive star prior to the explosion, while the
ambient medium around type Ia SNRs is hardly modiﬁed by the
SN progenitors. If Fe K emission from SNR G15.9+0.2 were
detected, we could obtain independent clues to the origin of the
remnant.

SNR G15.9+0.2 was serendipitously observed in XMM-
Newton pointings of a neighbouring target. Thanks to its superior
collective power, there are several points where results from
R06 can be elaborated upon and improved. In particular, the
eﬀective area of EPIC-pn is ﬁve times higher than Chandra’s
ACIS at 6.4 keV, making it a prime instrument to search for faint
Fe K emission yet undetected. The Chandra image revealed an
incomplete shell in X-rays, broken in the north-west quadrant,
while radio emission is still found there. With XMM-Newton we
can look for and characterise X-ray emission to much fainter
limits. Furthermore, the SNR is bright and extended enough

(∼ 5.5′ across) so that even with the modest angular resolution
oﬀered by XMM-Newton, we can measure abundances and
plasma conditions in various regions around the remnant. The
derived abundance ratios can constrain the type of progenitor
and provide additional hints to the origin of the SNR. Finally,
using X-ray spectral analysis and other tracers (namely atomic
and molecular gas), we can reassess the age of the SNR and the
measurements of its distance.

This work is organised as follows: We ﬁrst present the
observations and data reduction in Sect. 2. Next, we describe in
Sect. 3 the results of the morphological and spectral analyses. In
Sect. 4, we discuss the type of progenitor, age, and distance to
SNR G15.9+0.2, as well as the evolution of Fe K lines in SNRs
in general. We summarise our ﬁndings in Sect. 5.

2. X-ray observations and data reduction

SNR G15.9+0.2 was in the ﬁeld of view (FoV) of two XMM-
Newton observations targeting PSR J1819−1458,
the ﬁrst
X-ray counterpart to a Rotating RAdio Transients (RRATs,
Reynolds et al. 2006a; McLaughlin et al. 2007; Miller et al.
2013). The SNR is located at oﬀ-axis angles ranging from 8′
to 12′. Only MOS data are available for the ﬁrst observation,
which was performed with EPIC in small window (SW) mode
(the outer MOS CCDs are active even in SW mode). We
discarded two additional observations that were very short
(. 5 ks). Details of the observations used in this paper are listed
in Table 1.

We used the XMM SAS 2 version 14.0.0 for the data reduc-
tion. We applied a threshold of 8 and 2.5 cts ks−1 arcmin−2 on
pn and MOS light curves in the 7–15 keV energy band to screen
out periods of high background activity. This resulted in useful
exposure times of 47 ks and 33 ks.

We created two sets of images and exposure maps in various
energy bands from the ﬁltered event lists: A “broad band”
set covering 0.2 keV to 12 keV in ﬁve bands as given in
Watson et al. (2009, their Table 3), and an “SNR” set described
in Sect. 3.1. Single and double-pixel events (0 ≤ PATTERN ≤ 4)
were extracted from the pn detector, while all valid events from
the MOS detectors were selected (0 ≤ PATTERN ≤ 12). Masks
were applied to ﬁlter out bad pixels and columns. The SAS
task edetectchain is applied simultaneously to the ﬁve images
of the broad band set to identify X-ray (point) sources in each
observations. The detection lists were primarily used to exclude
unrelated point sources from the spectrum extraction regions.

3. Results

3.1. Morphology

To study the morphology of SNR G15.9+0.2, we used three
energy bands tailored to its spectrum (R06). A soft band from
0.9 to 2.1 keV which includes strong lines from magnesium
and silicon; a medium band from 2.1 to 3.25 keV which
comprises sulphur and argon lines; and a hard band (3.25–7.2
keV) which includes the high-energy part of the continuum and
possibly emission from calcium and Fe K lines. Owing to high
absorption, there is little emission below 0.8 keV, while the
instrumental background dominates above 7.2 keV.

We used ﬁlter wheel closed (FWC) data 3, obtained with the
detector shielded from astrophysical background, to subtract the
detector background. The contribution of detector background
in each observation was estimated from the count rate in the
corners of the images, since they are not exposed to the sky.
We then subtracted appropriately scaled FWC data from the
raw images. The detector background-subtracted images from
the two observations were merged together. They were then
adaptively smoothed: the sizes of Gaussian kernels were chosen
at each position to reach a signal-to-noise ratio of ﬁve, with a
minimum full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20′′. In each
band, we co-added the smoothed images from pn and MOS,
and divided the resulting image by the corresponding vignetted
exposure map 4.

The composite X-ray image of SNR G15.9+0.2 is shown in
Fig. 1. The annular stripes at high energy (in blue) are straylight
emission (see Sect. 3.2) unrelated to the SNR. The position of
the CCO is marked. A faint point source is detected 2′′ from

4 To produce a combined exposure map, we weighted the MOS
exposure maps with a factor of 0.4 relative to pn, accounting for the
lower eﬀective area

CXOU J181852.0−150213, i.e. well within the typical XMM-
Newton statistical and systematical position uncertainties. The
ﬂux and hardness ratios are consistent with those measured
with Chandra (R06) so we are conﬁdent that we are indeed
detecting the CCO. However, there are not enough counts (.
200) to improve on results from R06 or Klochkov et al. (2016),
especially with the lower angular resolution of XMM-Newton.

SNR G15.9+0.2 exhibits a well-deﬁned shell morphology.
The eastern and south-western edges are particularly bright,
and all the SNR emission above ∼ 3.5 keV is concentrated
in these regions. In contrast, the north-western quadrant of the
shell is much fainter than the rest of the SNR, and only X-rays
below 3 keV are detected in this region. The shell’s morphology
is a slightly elongated ellipse, with major and minor axes of
6.2′ and 5.2′, respectively. That translates into a linear size of
(9.0 pc × 7.6 pc) (D / 5 kpc). The major axis has a position
angle 150° eastwards of north. The centre of the ellipse is at RA
(J2000) = 18h 18m 53.8s, DEC = −15◦ 01m 38s. The CCO is thus
oﬀset 44′′ from the visual centre.

3.2. Spectral analysis

The deﬁnition of extraction regions for spectral analysis was
driven by the observed morphology. A spatially integrated spec-
tra was extracted from the ellipse described previously. To look
for spectral variations, we separated the bright regions of the
shell in two subregions, “Shell E” and “Shell SW” (for east and
south-west, respectively). These are shown over an X-ray image
in Fig. 2. A third region covers the fainter north-western part of
the shell (“faint NW”). We also extracted a spectrum from the
interior of the SNR.

Point sources detected with Chandra5, including the CCO,
were excised from our XMM-Newton spectral extraction re-
gions. Most of the sources detected with XMM-Newton in the
shell region (by edetectchain) are emission knots, therefore
truly originating from the SNR and were kept in the analysis.
Background spectra were taken from a large region surrounding
the SNR (not shown in Fig. 2). We excluded straylight stripes
and point sources detected with XMM-Newton from the back-
ground regions.

Owing to the telescope vignetting and oﬀ-axis position of the
SNR, the eﬀective area changes across the extent of the SNR;
it decreases with larger oﬀ-axis angles, and more so at higher
energies. Before extracting spectra, we corrected the ﬁltered
event lists for vignetting with the SAS task evigweight. As
for the images, single and double-pixel events were included
in pn spectra, and events with PATTERN = 0 to 12 were se-
lected in MOS spectra. With the FTOOLS task grppha, we
rebinned all spectra to have a minimum of 25 counts per bin in
order to allow the use of the χ2-statistic. Non-rebinned spectra
were used with the C-statistic (Cash 1979) for the study of
Fe K lines (Sect. 3.2.2) because of the limited photon statistics
above 6 keV. These spectra were extracted from non-vignetting-
weighted event lists to retain the Poissonian nature of the errors.
XSPEC (Arnaud 1996) version 12.9.0e was used for the spectral
analysis. All uncertainties listed in this paper are given at the
90% conﬁdence level, unless otherwise stated.

For spectral analysis, we employed the method described
in Maggi et al. (2016): We simultaneously ﬁt the source and
background spectra with the instrumental and astrophysical
contributions to the background explicitly modelled. This is
preferable to simply subtracting a background spectrum taken
from a nearby region because of the diﬀerent instrumental
responses and background contributions from diﬀerent regions
and because of the resulting loss in the statistical quality of the
source spectrum.

Spectra were extracted from FWC data at the same de-
tector positions as the source and background regions, in or-
der to capture the spatial variations of the instrumental back-
ground. Our model for the instrumental background takes into
account electronic noise and particle-induced background, as
described in Sturm (2012) and Maggi et al. (2016). We ﬁrst ﬁt
this model to FWC data from all extraction regions. The best-
ﬁt models are used in subsequent ﬁts (including astrophysical
signal), allowing only a constant renormalisation factor. This
avoids overloading the number of free parameters. Another non-
X-ray background component is the soft proton contamina-
tion (SPC), which we modelled following the prescription of
Kuntz & Snowden (2008). The SPC parameters were diﬀerent
for each instrument and observation (the soft proton ﬂux is
highly time-variable). Indeed, we found a higher SPC in the 2006
observation.

Next, we deﬁned a model for the astrophysical X-ray back-
ground (AXB). Initially, we used a single unabsorbed thermal
plasma (apec in XSPEC) for local contributions (local hot
bubble and/or solar wind charge-exchange emission) and an ab-
sorbed two-temperature plasma (apec + apec) for the remote
(Galactic) component. The cosmic X-ray background is added,
with additional absorption, to the remote component as a power
law with a photon index Γ ﬁxed to 1.41 (De Luca & Molendi
2004). Initial trial ﬁts to the background spectra showed that a

second remote Galactic component was not needed. This usually
accounts for the very hot (kT > 5 keV) plasma from the Galactic
ridge X-ray emission (GRXE), which is not detected in our data.
In particular, we do not see the strong Fe K line at 6.7 keV
associated with the GRXE (Koyama et al. 1986). We place a 3σ
upper limit of 2.8×10−8 ph cm−2 s−1 arcmin−2 on a Galactic ridge
Fe K line. Below 1 keV, the initial model had strong residuals.
A much better ﬁt was achieved with the inclusion of a second
thermal component. The ﬁnal model for the AXB is

where S i
apec is the emission from an apec model at temperature
kT i with normalisation Normi. The latter
is deﬁned as
(10−14/4πD2) R nenHdV, with D the distance to the source
and ne and nH the density of electrons and protons, all
in the cgs system of units. phabs is the photoelectric
absorption model we used in XSPEC, with cross-sections
from Balucinska-Church & McCammon (1992). Abundances
were set to those of Wilms et al. (2000).

The model of Eq. 1 reproduces fairly well the background
spectrum (see Fig. 3). The best-ﬁt parameters are listed
in Table 2. Our CXB surface brightness is an order of
magnitude higher than derived at high Galactic latitudes from
various instruments (Kushino et al. 2002; Lumb et al. 2002;
De Luca & Molendi 2004; Revnivtsev et al. 2005). This can be
attributed partly to cosmic variance, and partly to contribution
by unresolved hard X-ray sources in the Galaxy which are by
design not in the aforementioned CXB studies. We note that
Katsuda et al. (2015) ﬁt the CXB on a background spectrum
around RX J1713.7-3946, located symmetrically from SNR
G15.9+0.2 with respect to the Galactic Centre. Their value of
(1.0 − 3.2) × 10−5 ph keV−1 cm−2 s−1 arcmin−2 at 1 keV is fully
consistent with ours (1.6 × 10−5).

Another potentially problematic source of background is
straylight. Photons from bright sources outside the FoV can be
singly reﬂected by the hyperboloid mirrors and reach the camera.

energy band 0.3–8 keV.

Sources 0.3° to 1.4° oﬀ-axis produce ring-like structures in EPIC
images 6, such as seen in our images. Following the direction
to the foci of the straylight rings from the aimpoint of the
observations, we can ﬁrmly identify the contaminating source
as GX 17+2, located 1.26° oﬀ-axis. GX 17+2 is a low-mass
X-ray binary accreting at Eddington luminosity (e.g. Lin et al.
2012, and references therein). Excising straylight rings from
the background extraction regions is straightforward. However,
some single-reﬂection arcs also intersect (bright) regions of the
SNR. We therefore chose to include another component to model
the straylight emission possibly included in the spectra from the
SNR regions. To analyse the straylight spectrum, we extracted
counts from the ring-like structures in all the FoV, except over
SNR G15.9+0.2. The spectrum of GX 17+2 can be represented
as a combination of black body, multicolour disk, and power-
law emission, with variable relative contributions (Cackett et al.
2010; Lin et al. 2012) depending on the state of GX 17+2,
although a single component model is suﬃcient given the limited
count statistics of the single reﬂections. We note in particular
that we do not see Fe K emission from GX 17+2 (Cackett et al.
2012) in the straylight spectrum, which has almost no signal
above 6 keV. We used an absorbed black body with NH =
3.1 × 1022 cm−2 and kT = 0.99 keV. The normalisation is free
for all exposures, as it depends on both the intrinsic variability
of the source and on its exact location relative to the mirrors.
Overall, the ﬂux collected in all the arcs is 10−4 − 10−3 times
the ﬂux of GX 17+2, consistent with the straylight collecting
area (<0.2 % of the on-axis eﬀective area). We included this
component in the background model of spectra in the source
regions. The spectral parameters were ﬁxed. A constant factor
was the only free parameter allowed to vary between 0 (no
contribution) and fstray, where fstray is a geometrical factor, the
fraction of the straylight arc overlapping the SNR region.

All background components are included in the dashed lines (model from Fig. 3, plus straylight contamination, see Sect. 3.2). The best-ﬁt ﬁducial
model for the SNR emission is in green, with corresponding residuals in the bottom panels. We note the changing vertical scale between rows.

3.2.1. Spectral ﬁts and spatial variations

In a ﬁrst attempt, we ﬁt single-temperature models to the spectra
from each region, combining the background model and one
or more components for the SNR emission. All background
parameters are ﬁxed to their best-ﬁt values, except for nor-
malisation factors for the AXB and the straylight models. We
assumed non-equilibrium ionisation (NEI) for the SNR emis-
sion, using a plane-parallel shock model (vpshock in XSPEC,
Borkowski et al. 2001), which features a linear distribution of
0 nedt). AtomDB 3.0 7 is used to calculate
ionisation ages (τ = R
the spectrum.

t

We started with the “Shell E” spectrum from the brightest
region. Initial ﬁts with vpshock and solar abundances clearly
failed, leaving strong residuals at line energies of main elements,
in particular Si and S. With free Mg, Si, and S abundances,
the ﬁt improved by ∆χ2 = −797. Some residuals remained
at E ∼ 3.2 keV and 3.9 keV, where Ar and Ca emission is
expected. With their abundances freed, the ﬁt improved further
by ∆χ2 = −95 for a ﬁnal χ2 / d.o.f = 2191.2/1967. The enhanced

of the emission. In all these ﬁts there are line-like residuals at
6.4 keV – 6.7 keV, which betrays unaccounted for Fe K emission.
It cannot be improved by enhanced Fe abundance, because the
plasma temperature, constrained by the bulk of the emission,
is too low to produce appreciable Fe K emission. Adding a
Gaussian improved the ﬁts; we analyse the Fe K emission in
detail in Sect. 3.2.2.

Because the 6.4 keV feature is very minor, we restrict in a
ﬁrst time the analysis to the vpshock model with free Mg, Si,
S, Ar, and Ca abundances as it gives a good ﬁt to the the global
emission that can be applied in all regions of the SNR. We refer
to this model as the ﬁducial model. The best-ﬁt parameters in
each region are listed in Table 3.

The temperature and ionisation age in the “Shell E” spectrum
are 1.32 keV and 8.5 × 1010 cm s−3. The spectrum in the “Shell
SW” region is similar to its eastern counterpart, with a higher
temperature (1.53 keV) but the same ionisation age within the
uncertainties. The interior spectrum is virtually the same as that
in the “Shell SW”, albeit fainter, indicating that we are seeing
(in projection) similar shock conditions as in the south-west.
The spectrum in the “faint NW” region is the most diﬀerent;
the temperature is signiﬁcantly lower (kT ≈ 0.7 keV) and the
ionisation age is higher (τ ∼ 8 × 1011 cm s−3), although poorly

constrained. The eastern emission is the most absorbed with a
column density NH = 5 × 1022 cm−2, while NH is lower in
the interior and south-west. The NH in the interior (4.10+0.12
×
−0.26
1022 cm−2) is consistent with the value ﬁt by Klochkov et al.
(2016) for the CCO using a carbon atmosphere model, the
only one that yields a reasonable distance (10+9
−5 kpc). The X-
ray emission from the north-west appears the least absorbed
(NH . 4 × 1022 cm−2). These absorption features are discussed
in relation with atomic and molecular gas in Sect. 4.3.

The abundances are highly elevated (in excess of 1.5–2
times solar) in every region except the “faint NW”, where some
abundances are consistent with solar when taking into account
the large uncertainties. We do not ﬁnd a solar value for Si, as did
R06 in Chandra data ﬁt with the same model. The abundances of
Ar and Ca are, however, poorly constrained in spectra with lower
statistics, in particular in the interior and north-western regions.
Within the uncertainties, there are no clear spatial variations of
the abundance ratios of Mg or S relative to Si. We also applied
the ﬁducial model to the integrated spectrum of SNR G15.9+0.2.
The resulting best-ﬁt parameters are listed in Table 3. They are
consistent with ﬂux-averaging of the parameters obtained in the
four regions.

It appears from the ﬁducial model that a signiﬁcant fraction,
or the majority, of the emission originates from shock-heated
ejecta. Therefore, we attempted a multicomponent model ap-
proach (similar e.g. to that in Kosenko et al. 2010): A single kT
NEI component (vpshock) is used for each element or group
of elements. This examines whether various elements are found
at diﬀerent temperatures or ionisation ages. To model emission
from pure ejecta, we set the abundance of the corresponding
element(s) to 109 and all the others to 0. The model thus
comprises i) a component for Mg; ii) a component for Si, S,
Ar, and Ca. They are grouped together as they are expected to be
roughly co-spatial in the ejecta of a (core-collapse) supernova.
The abundances of S, Ar, and Ca are free relative to Si; iii) a
component for iron, the innermost ejecta, which we detected
through Fe K emission; and iv) an additional component with
solar abundance to account for the emission from shocked
ambient medium (hereafter solar component). All components
share a common NH.

Article number, page 6 of 11

This model was applied to the bright eastern and south-
western spectra. Taking into account the seven additional free
parameters, the ﬁts with the multicomponent model are equally
as good or slightly better than those with the ﬁducial model.
Again, the NH is higher in the eastern region, conﬁrming that
this spatial variation is not strongly model dependent. The solar-
abundances component dominates the continuum. It is there-
fore unsurprising that a pure-ejecta model (without the solar-
abundances component) fails to describe the data satisfactorily.
The temperature of the solar-abundances component is (1.3 –
1.5) keV without spatial variation in τ, as with the ﬁducial
model. The Si-group component has a lower temperature (0.9 –
1 keV) and higher τ (2 × 1011 cm s−3) than the solar and Mg
components. Without the help of the absorbed iron L-shell lines
below 1.2 keV, we cannot constrain well the kT − τ combination
for Fe, an issue further complicated by the complex nature of the
Fe K emission, as described in the next section.

3.2.2. Fe K emission

Here we present a separate treatment of the Fe K emission at
6.4 keV – 6.7 keV for comparison with the results of Y14. The
same background model as previously described is included.
Data between 0.6 keV and 4 keV are excluded, thus avoiding the
prominent line emission from elements other than Fe. The low-
energy part (from 0.3 to 0.6 keV) is used to ﬁx the normalisation
of the background model. The continuum emission is modelled
by an absorbed Bremsstrahlung (NH ﬁxed to 5 × 1022 cm−2),
and the Fe K emission by a Gaussian. There is only a signiﬁcant
detection of the line in the “Shell E” and “Shell SW” regions, and
particularly in pn data. There is no clear signature in the MOS
spectra owing to their lower eﬀective area. Still, we present the
results of the joint pn/MOS analysis since it helps in constraining
the continuum. No diﬀerences were found in the line properties
when using only pn data.

We start the analysis with the “Shell E” spectrum, which has
the best signal. With a width ﬁxed to zero 8, the best-ﬁt Gaussian

has a centroid energy of 6405+52
−49 eV (Table 4). However, this
model leaves residuals around the centroid energy, as shown
in Fig. 5 (left). When the width (σ) of the line is freed, the ﬁt
improves signiﬁcantly (∆C= −12) for σ = 191+131
− 72 eV, with a
centroid energy shifted to 6519+81
−79 eV (Fig. 5, middle). The data
can be ﬁt equally well or slightly better (∆C= −5.3) by using
two zero-width Gaussians. In that case, one is at low energy
(∼ 6.4 keV) and the second is close to 6.7 keV (Fig. 5, right).
In the south-west region, only a narrow high-energy component
is detected; there is no improvement when thawing the line width
(Table 4). We note that in the population study of Y14, the
Gaussian width was left free in all the ﬁts (Hiroya Yamaguchi,
personal communication).

We also extracted a spectrum covering both the east and
south-west regions (“Bright” region in Table 4), to measure the
integrated properties of the Fe K emission without adding too
much background from the interior and “faint NW” regions
where the line is not detected. We found a best-ﬁt centroid at
6577+73
− 57 eV (Fig. 6). In this region,
a good ﬁt is also obtained with the two-Gaussian model, for
centroids of 6411 ±46 eV and 6670+34

for a 6.6 keV line in the remaining regions with no detection is
2 × 10−6 photon cm−2 s−1.

We attempted to pinpoint the spatial origin of the low-
energy component (6.4 keV) of the line in the “Shell E”. The
limited statistics and spatial resolution prevent us from creating
narrow band images above 6 keV. Instead, we split the “Shell
E” region into an inner and outer arcs of same width (∼ 1′),
and repeated the analysis with the models described above. A
zero-width Gaussian ﬁt results in a higher ionisation in the inner
region (6615+28
−45 eV),
but the spread reduces somewhat when using the model with
free width that is slightly preferred. With a two-Gaussian ﬁts,
the ∼ 6.65 keV component has a higher ﬂux than the 6.4 keV
one in the inner region, while the opposite holds in the outer
region. This suggests a higher ionisation in the inner region, but
we stress that the evidence for this are rather marginal due to
the poor statistics. We discuss the complex nature of the Fe K
emission in relation with other SNRs in Sect. 4.2.

4. Discussion

4.1. Type of progenitor

The abundance pattern in the ejecta, as revealed by X-ray
spectroscopy, contains clues to the progenitor type of SNR
G15.9+0.2. In Fig. 7, we plot abundances relative to Si (by
number), in the form [X/Si] ≡ log [(X/Si)/(X/Si)⊙], using the
results of the ﬁducial model in the integrated spectrum. We add
the abundance pattern predicted by nucleosynthesis models of
CC and type Ia SNe; yields of CC SNe of various progenitor
masses are taken from Nomoto et al. (2006) 9. For type Ia SNe,
we used abundances resulting from delayed-detonation and
pulsed delayed-detonation models, called DDTe and PDDe in
Badenes et al. (2003); only the former is shown in Fig. 7. Mg/Si
ratios were not given originally in Badenes et al. (2003), but are
taken from Rakowski et al. (2006).

What best sets apart type Ia and CC SNe yields is the
abundance of magnesium relative to silicon. All type Ia mod-
els produce very little Mg as it is mostly incinerated by the
thermonuclear burning front. In massive stars, Mg is mainly
produced in explosive C/Ne burning and hydrostatic (i.e. pre-
SN) burning of C and Ne 10, so that the Mg yield varies strongly
with the progenitor mass. The [Mg/Si] ratio in SNR G15.9+0.2
(−0.1±0.4) is 40 times that obtained in the DDTe model and 600
times that of the PDDe model, while consistent with several CC
models of Nomoto et al. (2006), for instance a progenitor mass
of 18 M⊙, 25 M⊙, or 30 M⊙. One caveat is that the abundance
ratios in Fig. 7 are those of the shocked ejecta, the only material
we have access to with X-ray observations. If some amount of
Mg is missing, the true Mg/Si ratio will be higher and even
less compatible with a type Ia progenitor. Conversely, if Si is
underestimated, the Mg/Si will decrease. It is, however, very
unlikely that a suﬃcient quantity of unshocked Si is present
to produce a Mg/Si ratio of more than one order of magnitude
below our measured value. Therefore, the Mg/Si ratio provides
a strong indication that the progenitor of SNR G15.9+0.2 was a
massive star, strengthening the physical association of the central
source CXOU J181852.0−150213 with the SNR.

The ratios of S, Ar, and Ca to Si provide less information
because these elements are products of explosive oxygen and sil-
icon burning with little variation over the progenitor mass range.
The variation is mainly due to the additional Si contributions
from hydrostatic burning (Thielemann et al. 1996). Ca/Si and
Ar/Si ratios are also aﬀected by the metallicity of the progeni-
tors. The pre-explosion neutron excess η, mostly contributed by
22Ne, increases linearly with the initial metallicity (Timmes et al.
2003; Badenes et al. 2008). At increasing η, yields of heavy
neutron-rich elements (e.g. Mn and Ni) increase, that of Ca and
Ar decline, while that of Si remains constant (De et al. 2014;
Miles et al. 2016). The high Ar/Si and Ca/Si observed in SNR
G15.9+0.2 could partly be explained by a progenitor with a
lower than solar metallicity 11. However, we cannot constrain
the progenitor mass (or metallicity) very well because of the
large uncertainties (particularly Ar/Si and Ca/Si). Formally, the
model with a progenitor mass of 25 M⊙ provides a good match

9 Yields Table 2013, available at http://star.herts.ac.uk/
~chiaki/works/YIELD_CK13.DAT.
10 Large amounts of O and Ne are also produced at the same sites, but
their X-ray emissions are absorbed and absent in SNR G15.9+0.2.
11 These arguments come from studies of
thermonuclear SNe.
However, the eﬀect of neutronisation on Ca yield should qualitatively be
the same in the incomplete Si-burning and explosive O-burning layers
in a CC SN, where most of Ca is produced (Thielemann et al. 1996).

4.2. Evolutionof Fe K linesin SNRs

In a study of the Fe K emission in SNRs with Suzaku, Y14
showed that the centroid energy separates the two types of
SNRs; the Fe-rich ejecta in Type Ia remnants are signiﬁcantly
less ionised than in core-collapse SNRs. This can naturally be
explained if the ambient medium around CC SNRs is modiﬁed
(namely made denser) by mass loss episodes from the progeni-
tors, while relatively unaﬀected around type Ia SNe, because the
ionisation timescale is controlled by ne.

Since there is strong evidence, as shown above, that SNR
G15.9+0.2 originates in a core-collapse SN, a high centroid
energy is expected for the Fe K line. Instead we found an
intermediate value of 6577+73
−70 eV when following the same
method as Yamaguchi et al. (i.e. one free-width Gaussian on
the integrated SNR spectrum), making SNR G15.9+0.2 the CC
SNR with the lowest Fe K centroid among the sample of Y14
(Fig. 8, top panel). The moderate spatial resolution enabled by
the existing XMM-Newton data reveals that the Fe K emission is
non-uniform: In the “Shell E” region, we detect both ∼6.4 keV
and ∼6.65 keV signals attributable to contributions from pooly
and highly ionised iron, which in the overall spectrum produce a
line at the observed centroid of 6.58 keV.

The detection of a 6.4 keV line from a CC SNR is remark-
able. Such a line has been found in CC SNRs Kes 79 (Sato et al.
2016) and HESS J1745−303 (Bamba et al. 2009), but it was
proposed not to be of ionised plasma origin. In Kes 79, the
6.4 keV emission is attributed to K-shell ionisation of neutral
iron by the interaction of locally accelerated protons with a
nearby molecular cloud, while Bamba et al. (2009) suggested
that the line in HESS J1745−303 was from an X-ray reﬂection
nebula reﬂecting X-rays from previous Galactic centre activity
oﬀ a molecular cloud. Neither of these scenarios are likely for
SNR G15.9+0.2: There are no striking spatial correlations of the
6.4 keV emission with molecular clouds as in Kes 79 (see Fig. 9),
nor reported detection of OH maser to support an interaction
with molecular clouds (Green et al. 1997). An X-ray reﬂection

nebula origin, as in HESS J1745−303, is also not favoured given
the lack of a suitable nearby hard X-ray source, and the poor
spatial correlation between the 6.4 keV emission and molecular
material.

In SNR G15.9+0.2, an ionised plasma origin is favoured.
The variations in ionisation between east and west regions, and
inner/outer parts of “Shell E” (Sect. 3.2.2) points to a range
of net due to variations in the ambient density encountered by
the shock, or to diﬀerent times since the plasma was shocked.
The material in the east could be part of a cavity that the
shock encountered recently, akin to the case in the type Ia SNR
RCW 86 (Broersen et al. 2014). Such density variations and/or
cavities are likely to be common, especially around young CC
SNRs, but are hard to observe, except in the brightest and more
extended sources. As another instance, Saﬁ-Harb et al. (2005)
found diﬀerent Fe K centroids in eastern and western regions of
3C 397, attributed to density gradients.

Patnaude et al. (2015) have modelled CC SNe exploding
in CSM modiﬁed by progenitors’ winds and followed their
dynamics (i.e. shock radius) and spectral evolution of Fe K
emission (centroid and luminosity). Although these models

were able to reproduce the higher centroids (above 6550 eV)
observed in CC SNRs, there were many outliers where either
the correct shock radius and centroid were not reproduced
by the models, or where the Fe K luminosity was severely
underpredicted. Placing SNR G15.9+0.2 in that context, the
bulk Fe K properties (in particular its low centroid) and size
of about 4 (D / 5 kpc) pc (see Sect. 3.1) can be reproduced by
their SN 1987A or SN 1993J models (e.g. Fig. 2, Patnaude et al.
2015). The low Fe K luminosity of SNR G15.9+0.2 (∼ 2 ×
1040 (D / 5 kpc) photon s−1) can be reproduced by most of their
models in the lower mass loss rate/higher wind velocity cases.

Regardless of type, the distribution of Fe K centroids in
SNRs is peaked at the low- and high-energy ends (see Fig. 8,
middle panel) with relatively few objects between 6.5 keV
and 6.6 keV. This is due to the rapid transition between a
roughly 6.4 keV centroid (no iron above the Fe xvii state) and
a 6.6−6.7 keV centroid (most iron above Fe xx). To illustrate
this, we simulated emission from a pure-iron ionising plasma
(vpshock in XSPEC) at kT = 1.5 keV and 5 keV, with τ between
108 s cm−3 and 5 × 1013 s cm−3. Fake spectra were produced
using the EPIC-pn response and analysed in the same fashion as
in Y14 and in this work. The curves of the expected centroids are
shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 8. The Fe K transition occurs
brieﬂy, or more speciﬁcally over a small τ interval, between a
few 1010 s cm−3 and a few 1011 s cm−3. For SNRs expanding in
a constant ambient density of ne = 1 cm−3, this happens at an
age of ∼ 1000 − 5000 yr. The oldest type Ia SNRs in the sample
of Y14 are from 4500 to 6000 yr old (SNR G337.2−0.7 and SNR
G344.7−0.1). They are associated with relatively low density
(ne ∼ 0.3 to 0.8 cm−3, Rakowski et al. 2006; Giacani et al. 2011)
so that a low Fe ionisation is expected even at this age.

The possibility remains open for a type Ia SNR in a denser
medium (& 2 cm−3) to reach a high ionisation of iron within
a few thousand years and populate the Fe K centroid region
dominated so far by CC SNRs. Without deﬁnitive evidence as
to its type (Park et al. 2012), N49 might be such an object,
since it is interacting with a relatively high density (at least 2–
25 cm−3, Sankrit et al. 2004; Dopita et al. 2016). Symmetrically,
it can not excluded that some CC SNRs are found at the low
ionisation end. Part of SNR G15.9+0.2, for instance, still has
emission at 6.4 keV, while SNR G352.7−0.1 has an Fe K
centroid at 6.44 keV and is also of uncertain type; some studies
suggest that it is the remnant a CC SNR (Giacani et al. 2009;
Pannuti et al. 2014). Another caveat is that the current sample
of Fe K emitting objects inherently contains some age bias,
the youngest objects being preeminently of type Ia. There are
six type Ia SNRs younger than ∼ 1000 yr, but only three CC
SNRs below the 2000 yr mark. Together with the lower density
expected around type Ia SN progenitors, this bias contributes to
separate the Fe K centroids of both classes. We conclude that the
Fe K centroid-luminosity diagram provides valuable information
about an SNR, but care should be taken when using it as a typing
tool without any knowledge of the surrounding medium or
indication of age. This is particularly true for unresolved objects,
e.g. young SNRs in external galaxies, or objects where the nature
of the Fe K emission is unknown and might not be from an
ionised plasma, as is the case in Kes 79 and HESS J1745−303.

4.3. Constraining the age of and distance to SNR G15.9+0.2

To constrain the distance to the SNR, we compared the absorp-
tion along the line of sight derived from the X-ray and from
H i and 12CO (1-0) observations. Figure 9 (left panel) shows
the velocity spectra at the SNR centre (RA = 18h 18m 53.8s,

densities towards SNR G15.9+0.2 as a function of VLSR. Right : 13CO intensity map in the velocity range 18 km s−1 < VLSR < 32 km s−1, in units

DEC = −15◦ 01m 38s) integrated within a radius of 3′. The
12CO observations are from the CfA survey (Dame et al. 2001)
and the H i data from the SGPS survey (Haverkorn et al. 2006).
The corresponding kinematic distances assuming the circular
Galactic rotation model of Hou et al. (2009) with a distance
to the Galactic center of 8 kpc are also shown. We note that
the bulk of the material along the line of sight is at radial
velocities relative to the local standard of rest (LSR) of VLSR
< 60 km s−1 which is equivalent to a lower limit on the distance
of 5 kpc. The cumulative NH derived from H i and 12CO as a
function of VLSR is shown in Fig. 9 (middle panel) where all
the material is assumed to be at the near distance allowed by
the Galactic rotation curve, providing therefore a lower limit on
the distance. The CO-to-H2 mass conversion factor and the H i
brightness temperature to column density used is respectively
of 1.8 × 1020 cm−2 K−1 km−1 s (Dame et al. 2001) and 1.82 ×
1018 cm−2 K−1 km−1 s (Dickey & Lockman 1990).

Most of the absorption along the line of sight is due to the
structures at VLSR < 60 km s−1, representing an integrated NH =
2.2 × 1022 cm−2. With an X-ray absorption value of 4.58 ± 0.11 ×
1022 cm−2 (see Table 3), we argue that the SNR is behind these
structures and set a strict lower limit to its distance at 5 kpc. This
is consistent with the results of a carbon atmosphere ﬁt to the
CCO emission (Klochkov et al. 2016) that yields a large distance
(although highly uncertain) of 10+9

−5 kpc.

However, the total NH integrated along the entire velocity
range derived from H i and 12CO amounts to ∼ 3.5 × 1022 cm−2,
still signiﬁcantly less than the X-ray value. This discrepancy
could be due to an inadequate value of the CO-to-H2 mass con-
version factor which can vary within the Galaxy (e.g. Remy et al.
2015) or missing material not traced by HI or 12CO emission. In
particular in dense molecular clouds, the core of the cloud is not
well traced by 12CO owing to saturation of the emission.

are seen at the position of the shell E and shell SW regions,
explaining the spatial variations of NH found in Sect. 3.2.1.

To investigate the age of the SNR in more detail, we
used the equations describing the evolution of the forward
shock R presented by Truelove & McKee (1999) and generalised
to a steady stellar wind environment with ρ(r) ∝ r−2 by
Laming & Hwang (2003) & Hwang & Laming (2012). We ﬁxed
the explosion energy to E = 1051 ergs, n = 9, and s = 2,
where n, and s are the ejecta and ambient medium density proﬁle
(ρ(r) ∝ r−n,s). The ejecta mass was ﬁxed to 14 M⊙ (for an initial
progenitor mass of 25 M⊙) according to mass budget models of
core-collapse supernovae by Sukhbold et al. (2016).

The ambient medium density is derived from the X-ray
thermal emission of the “faint NW”, the least aﬀected by ejecta
and therefore best representing shocked ISM. The normalisation
of the ﬁducial model in that region (Table 3) is proportional to
the volume emission measure R nenHdV, which can be linked to
the pre-shock ambient hydrogen density nH,0 assuming a Sedov
proﬁle (e.g. Maggi et al. 2014, Eq. 1). With the uncertainties on
the normalisation in the “faint NW” region, we measure a range
of nH,0 = (0.36 − 0.70) (D / 5 kpc)−1/2 cm−3.

Considering the lower limit on the distance of 5 kpc derived
above, we obtain a lower limit on the age of 2 kyr. This
reproduces the observed angular distance (3.7′) between the
CCO and the tip of the faint NW region (Fig. 2). If the SNR
is near the Galactic centre, at a distance of 8.5 kpc as assumed
by R06, the age estimate is ∼ (4.5–6) kyr. In the case where the
shock has evolved only a small fraction of its lifetime in the steep
wind proﬁle, and quickly after evolved in the uniform shocked
wind region (assuming therefore s = 0), the corresponding ages
are tS NR > 1.6 kyr and t ∼ (3.5 − 4) kyr for a distance of 5 and
8.5 kpc, respectively.

The 13CO (1-0) line emission provides a tracer to investigate
the core of the dense molecular clouds. In Fig. 9 (right panel),
we show the high-resolution 13CO intensity map12 from the
GRS survey (Jackson et al. 2006). This map was obtained by
integrating velocities between 18 km s−1 < VLSR < 32 km s−1
corresponding to main peak of 13CO emission located at the
same velocity as the brightest 12CO peak shown in Fig. 9. This
material is likely in the foreground of the SNR. Small clouds

5. Summary

We have studied the Galactic SNR G15.9+0.2, observed
serendipitously with XMM-Newton. The remnant exhibits a
shell morphology with the brightest regions in the east and
south-west, and the faintest and softest
to the north-west.
Elemental abundances, particularly in the bright regions, are
markedly supersolar, betraying a SN ejecta origin. Analysis
of the ejecta abundance pattern establishes SNR G15.9+0.2
as a core-collapse SNR and suggests a progenitor mass of

20–25 M⊙. This makes the physical association with the CCO
CXOU J181852.0−150213 detected in its interior very likely.

We report for the ﬁrst time detection of Fe K emission from
SNR G15.9+0.2, using a careful treatment of all background
components to ensure that this signal is genuinely from the SNR.
We detect signal at both the low (6.4 keV) and high (6.67 keV)
ionisation end of the line, with spatial variation across the SNR.
Because SNR G15.9+0.2 is the core-collapse SNR with the
lowest overall Fe K centroid energy, caution should be used
when typing SNRs based on this criterion alone.

Matching the X-ray NH to atomic and molecular gas struc-
tures along the line of sight, we set a conservative limit of 5 kpc
for the distance towards the source. At such distances and for a
reasonable set of parameters aﬀecting the remnant’s dynamics,
we constrain its age to be likely more than 2000 yr.
