We propose a new way to correct for ﬁnite centrality bin width eﬀect i.e. participant ﬂuctuations
in ﬂuctuation analysis in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. The MMCP method allows to
separate participant ﬂuctuations and obtain ﬂuctuations from one participant - a source - from a
combination of the experimentally measured ﬁrst four moments. The EPOS model is used for the
numerical check of the MMCP for the net electric charge ﬂuctuations in the forward rapidity region
in Ar+Sc reactions at beam momentum 150 GeV/c. We show that using the existing methods
- decreasing a centrality bin width, or using the Centrality Bin Width Correction procedure, one
may still leave some residual participant ﬂuctuations in the sample. Moreover, we show that the
Centrality Bin Width Correction procedure may alter the ﬂuctuation measures. The most important
advantage of the MMCP is it’s precision even when the amount of measured events does not allow
to decrease the centrality bin width, or the experimental determination of participants is diﬃcult,
e.g. in collider experiments. Even for the largest centrality bin in the considered case, c = 0 − 20%,
the relative error of the MMCP for the scaled variance of a source is below 2%. It is especially
important in determination of the base line of the ﬂuctuations in the search for the QCD Critical
Point and the signals of the QCD phase transition.

INTRODUCTION

The measurements of multiplicity ﬂuctuations belong to the milestones of the heavy ion studies at SPS [1–3]
and RHIC [4–8]. Their aim is to ﬁnd the QCD critical point, and study its properties. The only experimentally
controllable way to probe the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter is by studying interactions of diﬀerent
system size nuclei at various energies. One of the main background eﬀects in such study is the ﬂuctuations of
nucleon participants, NP. It is the number of nucleons that interacted inelastically and produced other particles
during nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collision. This number ﬂuctuates from event to event, reﬂecting the geometry of
the collision, and, possibly, hiding ﬂuctuations from other sources. There are several popular ways of addressing
participant ﬂuctuations:

(i) the selection of as narrow centrality bins as possible,

(ii) the Centrality Bin Width Correction procedure (CBWC) [9],

(iii) the use of strongly intensive measures (SIM) [10–14],

see also for example [15]. The ﬁrst two methods are based on the eﬀect that participant ﬂuctuations decrease
with decreasing centrality bin width. The constrain of participant ﬂuctuations via centrality selection (i) in
ﬁxed target experiments is more precise than in collider experiments, a, as one can put a detector at the beam
line and measure the number of projectile spectators. This is the number of protons and neutrons from the
projectile nuclei that did not participate in the collision. If the detector measures zero signal, then it was the
’head on’ collision - almost all protons and neutrons were participants. In collider experiments it is impossible
to constrain participant ﬂuctuations with such precision. The projectile spectators ﬂy to the beam pipe of a
collider together with the nuclei that did not interact. Another source of participant ﬂuctuations are target
participants [16]. These remain unconstrained usually both in ﬁxed target and collider experiments, although
for central collisions such ﬂuctuations should be small. However, even small participant ﬂuctuations may aﬀect
ﬂuctuations described by higher order moments. Therefore, a reliable way to minimize participant ﬂuctuations
is necessary.

The idea behind the CBWC (ii) is that the centrality bin is divided into as narrow sub-bins as possible, and
then the ﬂuctuations in the bin are calculated from the ﬂuctuations in the sub-bins. The division is proposed to
suppress participant ﬂuctuations, while the recalculation is needed in order to decrease statistical uncertainty due
to small number of events in each sub-bin. The CBWC was used in STAR and ALICE Collaborations [9, 17–21].
Neither the decrease of the centrality, nor the CBWC can guarantee the full removal of participant ﬂuctuations.
Strongly intensive measures (iii) are independent of system’s volume and it’s event-by-event ﬂuctuations. In
order to calculate such variables, two quantities describing an event are required. Then, a special combination
of them cancels volume ﬂuctuations under assumptions that both quantities are produced in the same volume
and with the same volume ﬂuctuations in grand-canonical ensemble. The same result can be obtained in a
wounded nucleon model [22], or in the Independent Particle Production model (IPM) [23].

We propose a diﬀerent approach - to cancel participant ﬂuctuations in a combination of several high ﬂuctuation
moments of the same quantity, e.g. particle type. We call our new method - multi moment cancellation of
participant ﬂuctuations (MMCP). It exploits the relations between the measured ﬁrst four moments of the
multiplicity distribution in IPM. We test how participant ﬂuctuations depend on the centrality bin width (i),
and compare MMCP to CBWC (ii). The new method does not require the basic assumption of SIM that volume
and volume ﬂuctuations are the same for two quantities, because it can be necessary to avoid it. For example,
pions come mainly from resonance decays, while heavy multi-strange particles are produced directly in an A+A
reaction. The assumption of the same volume ﬂuctuations may be invalid for them. Then combining pions
and multi-strange particles into SIM may lead to a false conclusion. The most commonly used particles for
SIM are pions and kaons. They both have a large contribution of resonances, therefore, the usage of SIM is
acceptable at most energies for them. However, resonances are not enough to explain pions and kaons at all
energies. For example, the K +/π+ ratio exhibits the Horn structure at about 30A GeV energy, while K −/π−
does not, see [24] and, e.g. [25]. Therefore, SIM may be invalid in the situations, where the SIM are the most
needed. The MMCP may give an important advantage in these cases.

As the test we study the net electric charge ﬂuctuations in Ar+Sc reactions generated in EPOS 1.99 model [26,
27] at forward rapidities and beam momentum pbeam = 150 GeV/c. The Ar+Sc reactions are selected, because
they are studied as a part of NA61/SHINE energy and system size scan program [1]. EPOS is used, because it
is a realistic model of A+A collisions, which allows to keep track of the number of participants, and calculate
their contribution explicitly.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we introduce the necessary relations for our studies from
the IPM. Section III contains the results of the simulations of Ar+Sc reactions in EPOS and the tests of the
MMCP. In Section IV we compare MMCP and CBWC methods. Section V concludes the paper.

II. PARTICIPANT FLUCTUATIONS

A multiplicity distribution, P (N ), can be characterized by central moments, µn, which are deﬁned as follows

where

µn =

(cid:88)

N

(N − (cid:104)N (cid:105))n P (N ) = (cid:104)(N − (cid:104)N (cid:105))n(cid:105) ,

(cid:104)N n(cid:105) =

N n P (N )

(cid:88)

N

(2)

are raw moments. They are related to cumulants,

κ2 = µ2 ,

κ3 = µ3 ,

κ4 = µ4 − 3µ2

2 ,

. . . ,

(3)

The frequently used cumulant ratios - scaled variance, normalized skewness and normalized kurtosis - are:

ω =

κ2
(cid:104)N (cid:105)

=

σ2
(cid:104)N (cid:105)

,

S σ =

κ3
κ2

,

κ σ2 =

κ4
κ2

,

(4)

where σ is standard deviation. The quantities in Eq. (4) are intensive in an IPM, i.e. they do not depend
on average number of participants. However, they are not strongly intensive, because they depend on partic-
ipant ﬂuctuations, i.e. higher order moments of participant distribution. To assure clarity of the subsequent
consideration, the following notations are applied:

• the index P denotes quantities obtained from the participant distribution,

• the index A denotes quantities obtained from the distribution for a single participant - a source1,

• the net charge or lack of indices indicates quantities which are calculated from net electric charge distri-
bution created in Ar+Sc reaction with selected centrality, containing both the ﬂuctuations coming from
a source and participant ﬂuctuations.

An IPM assumes that the number of particles of interest N is given by the sum of contributions ni from NP
participants,

3

which are identical on average,

N =

NP(cid:88)

i=1

ni ,

(cid:104)ni(cid:105) = (cid:104)nj(cid:105) = (cid:104)nA(cid:105) .

(5)

(6)

The average multiplicity of produced particles (cid:104)N (cid:105) is then proportional to the average number of particles from
one source, (cid:104)nA(cid:105), and to the average number of participants (cid:104)NP(cid:105),

(cid:104)N (cid:105) = (cid:104)nA(cid:105) (cid:104)NP(cid:105) .

The additional assumption that particles from diﬀerent sources are independent,

(cid:104)ni nj . . . nk(cid:105) = (cid:104)ni(cid:105)(cid:104)nj(cid:105) . . . (cid:104)nk(cid:105) = (cid:104)nA(cid:105)k ,

allows to obtain scaled variance,

ω = ωA + (cid:104)nA(cid:105) ωP ,

normalized skewness,

normalized kurtosis,

S σ =

ωA SA σA + (cid:104)nA(cid:105) ωP [ 3 ωA + (cid:104)nA(cid:105) SP σP ]
ωA + (cid:104)nA(cid:105) ωP

(11)

and any other combination of higher moments2 [23].

The values of interest are the ﬂuctuations from a source: ωA, SA σA, κA σ2

A. They are mixed with the ﬂuctu-
P. Moreover, higher order ﬂuctuation moments have the contribution

ations of the participants ωP, SP σP, κP σ2
from lower order moments,

µn = F (cid:0)(cid:104)N 1(cid:105), (cid:104)N 2(cid:105), . . . (cid:104)N n(cid:105)(cid:1) ,

(12)

where F just denotes that the value on the l.h.s. of Eq. (12) is a function of the values in the brackets on the
r.h.s. of Eq. (12). Equation (12) is the usual property of a central moment, which can be seen by expanding
the binomial in Eq. (1). The assumption that there are participant or volume ﬂuctuations and the ﬂuctuations
from a source makes µn dependent on the moments of both, a source and participants,

µn = F (cid:0)(cid:104)n1

P (cid:105)(cid:1) .

(13)

1 An existence of such a distribution is assumed, and then it‘s characteristics are obtained using the information about the
participant distribution. A source deﬁned in this way represents a combination of all sources that produce the quantity of
interest. For example, if net charge is considered, then a source is anything that produces net charge and it‘s ﬂuctuations in
A+A reactions.

2 See also the derivation based on the assumption of the existence of the cumulant generating function with separable volume [13,

14, 28–30]

4

It gives n measures versus 2n unknowns for their description. However, it is unavoidable situation, if one is not
sure that the system consists of only one type of ﬂuctuations that are directly represented by the ﬂuctuation
moments as in (12).

Methods mentioned in the introduction address this obstacle to a various degree. The method (i) may still
leave some unknown fraction of participant ﬂuctuations even for a very narrow centrality bin. The method
(ii) was invented because of the design features of the STAR detector. It reduces statistical ﬂuctuations only,
leaving some participant ﬂuctuations [31], see next section. The introduction of strongly intensive measures (iii)
requires two types of measured values, i.e. multiplicities of particle type A, NA, and the multiplicity of particle
type B, NB, e.g. pions and kaons, and the assumption that all corresponding participant ﬂuctuations moments
(cid:105) = (cid:104)N n
are the same (cid:104)N n
P (cid:105). This may not be true, because participant ﬂuctuations may inﬂuence
PA
one particle type more than another.

(cid:105) = (cid:104)N n
PB

We propose another method - to ﬁnd a speciﬁc combination of several high moments, which cancel participant
ﬂuctuations in low moments. We face the same diﬃculty as in Eq. (13): n measures and 2n unknowns. However,
it is possible to overcome it assuming that participant ﬂuctuations are small, and neglect some participant
moments.

First of all, let us assume that the methods (i) and (ii) were eﬀective enough to make scaled variance for the

ﬂuctuations from a source close to the measured ﬂuctuations,

ω (cid:39) ωA ,

then

α =

ω − ωA
ωA

= (cid:104)nA(cid:105)

ωP
ωA

(cid:28) 1 .

(14)

The agreement between ω and its strongly intensive analog Ω presented in [32] for Ar+Sc reactions in 0 − 0.2%
centrality bin justiﬁes this assumption. In the next section we show by direct calculation that the assumption
(14) is valid in Ar+Sc even for centralities up to 0 − 20% in EPOS 1.99 model. One can rewrite Eqs. (10) and
(11) using α parameter (14), and expand them in Taylor series, leaving only the terms that are proportional to
zero-th and to the ﬁrst order of α:

S σ =

SA σA + α [ 3 ωA + (cid:104)nA(cid:105) SP σP ]
1 + α

(cid:39) SA σA (1 − α) + α [ 3 ωA + (cid:104)nA(cid:105) SP σP ] , α (cid:28) 1 ,

(15)

and

κ σ2 =

κA σ2

A + α (cid:2) (cid:104)nA(cid:105)2 κP σ2

P + ωA ( 3 ωA + 4 SA σA + 6 (cid:104)nA(cid:105) SP σP ) (cid:3)

(cid:39) κA σ2

A (1 − α) + α (cid:2) (cid:104)nA(cid:105)2 κP σ2

1 + α
P + ωA ( 3 ωA + 4 SA σA + 6 (cid:104)nA(cid:105) SP σP ) (cid:3) , α (cid:28) 1 .

(16)

Second, the scaled variance of a source, ωA, competes with the normalized skewness and kurtosis times the
P in Eqs. (15), (16). We assume that their ratio

number of particles from one source, (cid:104)nA(cid:105) SP σP, and (cid:104)nA(cid:105)2 κP σ2
is also small,

|β| = (cid:104)nA(cid:105)

(20)

where we omitted the terms proportional to α β and α γ. The assumptions (14), (17) is the mathematical
expression of the phrase ‘small participant ﬂuctuations’, because one can rewrite the conditions α (cid:28) 1, |β| (cid:28) 1,
|γ| (cid:28) 1 as follows:

ωP (cid:28)

(21)

Note that small participant ﬂuctuations mean that the ratio of the scaled variance to the number of particles
from one source is large. The set of equations (18-20) is underdetermined, because there are three measured
values, ω, S σ, κ σ2, and four unknowns α, ωA, SA σA, and κA σ2
A. Therefore, one can not solve (18-20), but

it is possible to express ωA, SA σA, and κA σ2
parameter α:

(24)

Let us again use the argument of the non-observation of large ﬂuctuations, which can be attributed to phase
transition from hadron matter to quark-gluon plasma, or to the QCD critical point. Then, we may assume that
the source of ﬂuctuations is mainly a result of an interplay of resonance decays and other non critical eﬀects,
which, nevertheless, have to be understood and ﬁltered out. The non-critical eﬀects can be estimated assuming
that the produced system is described by a gas of hadrons and resonances (HRG) [33–35], or by relativistic mean-
ﬁeld nuclear matter [36]. In ideal HRG with vanishing electric and strange chemical potentials, µQ = µS = 0,
one has for net baryon number [33]:

=

κA σ2
A
ω2
A

ω2
A

= tanh2(µB/T ) → 0 , µB/T → 0 ,

(25)

where µB is baryon chemical potential and T is temperature of the created system. The ratio µB/T decreases
fast with increasing energy of A+A reaction, therefore, tanh in Eq. (25) also decreases. The calculations of net
proton number and net electric charge in HRG along the freeze-out line [33, 35] also show the decrease of ratios
SAσA/ωA and κAσ2
A. The introduction of interactions between particles in the form of either HRG with
van der Waals interactions [37], or HRG with excluded volume ﬁtted to the Lattice data [38] further decreases
these ratios, especially at low energies [39]. Fortunately, the increasing energy of A+A reactions also gives
α, |β|, |γ| (cid:28) 1 for net charges, because small net charge gives even smaller (cid:104)nA(cid:105). Therefore, one can introduce
two more small parameters of the system,

A/ω2

Then, the system of equations (18-20) before any approximation looks as follows:

(27)

One can check that approximations α, |β|, |γ|, (cid:28) 1 lead to (18-20). If, additionally, 3α (cid:28) δ and 3α (cid:28) ε,
then ω (cid:39) ωA, S σ (cid:39) SAσA, κ σ2 (cid:39) κAσ2

the case, but α, |β|, |γ|, (cid:28) 1, and δ (cid:28) ε, or ε (cid:28) δ, then one can neglect either δ or ε, and solve Eqs. (18-20)

The approximate Eqs. (33,34) and (36,37) remove ﬂuctuations of participants and obtain the ﬂuctuation of
sources through measured values. This is the meaning of the MMCP method.

III. TEST OF THE MMCP IN EPOS

The EPOS 1.99 model [26, 27] is a hadronic interaction model which does very well compared to experimental
data at the SPS energy range [40, 41]. In order to test relations introduced in Sec. II the large sample of 20%
most central Ar+Sc interactions at beam momentum plab = 150 GeV/c is simulated. The centrality selection
is based on the absolute impact parameter b, i.e. 20% of events with the smallest b were selected. Fluctuations
strongly depend on the analysis acceptance. In this paper the calculation are performed in the forward rapidity
region assuming pion mass in center-of-mass frame (yCM S
> 0) excluding the beam spectator domain [42], i.e.
for each considered particle its yCM S
beam − 0.5. For simplicity,
detector eﬃciency is not considered. The simulation test was performed for net electric charge deﬁned as
the diﬀerence between positively and negatively charged hadrons in the studied acceptance. The number of
participants in a given event was obtained as a sum of variables npj and ntg in EPOS, which correspond to the
number of primary projectile and target participants, respectively. The statistical uncertainty of scaled variance
and higher order cumulant ratios were estimated using the bootstrap method [43].

(assuming p mass) has to be smaller than y∗

π

It should be underlined that EPOS has much more complex way of producing particles than the simple
wounded nucleon model. EPOS as a parton model describes the basis of high energy hadron-hadron interaction
as an exchange of a ’parton ladder’. In this model, it contains two parts: the hard and a soft one [27]. In
addition, there are two oﬀ-shell remnants (which behave as wounded nucleons in a limit of low energy) from
projectile and target as well as core-corona eﬀect for high density regions. Summarizing, in an event one can
see up to three types of sources: nucleons, stings+nucleons and core+string+nucleons [27, 44].

First of all, we check whether the assumptions of small participant ﬂuctuations, α, |β|, |γ| (cid:28) 1, are valid for
the system that we study, see Fig. 1 left. One can see that all the parameters are smaller than unity. The α (14)
and γ (17) decrease, when the bin width decreases (see caption to Fig. 1 right), while β increases. It means that
the selection of more central Ar+Sc colisions decreases the relative importance of ωP and κPσ2
P, but increases
the normalized skewness of participant number distribution, SPσP. The δ (26) is almost constant, which means
that the centrality selection almost does not inﬂuence the relation between scaled variance and skewness of a
source in the considered example, SAσA/ωA. It is interesting that ε (26), i.e. κAσA/ω2
A is sensitive to the bin
width. The condition |δ| (cid:28) |ε| is not always satisﬁed, however, |δ|, |ε| < 3α, therefore one can neglect both
δ and ε in (27). We check the approximate Eqs. (36) and (37) and more general equations (10) and (11), see
Figs. 2 and 3. Each point corresponds to a given centrality window and the corresponding NP distribution.
For example, the most left point corresponds to the centrality c = 0 − 20% and (cid:104)NP(cid:105) = 42.82(1), while the most
right point corresponds to the centrality c = 0 − 0.2% and (cid:104)NP(cid:105) = 57.68(2).

The values labeled as ‘net charge’ contain all possible sources of ﬂuctuations of net electric charge, i.e. they
include ﬂuctuations of participants and ﬂuctuations coming from a single source. The participant number and
its ﬂuctuations are directly obtained from EPOS and are labeled as ’participant’. The number of particles from
a single source are deﬁned as (cid:104)nA(cid:105) = (cid:104)N (cid:105)/(cid:104)NP(cid:105) = (cid:104)Nnet charge(cid:105)/(cid:104)Nparticipant(cid:105). The solid line shows the results
of the MMCP method, which should be compared with square points coming from a single source and labeled
as ‘A-source’, calculated using Eqs. (9), (10) and (11).

The ‘reference’ line is obtained selecting NP = const. In such case (cid:104)NP (cid:105) = NP and κ2 = 0, meaning that
SP σP and κP σ2
P are not deﬁned, since they contain the division by κ2 = 0 at this point. However, one can
prove that the scaled variance, the normalized skewness, and the normalized kurtosis can be set to zero in this
case. The condition NP = const is equivalent to the replacement of the participant distribution, P (NP), by the
uniform distribution, which is zero everywhere, except for the point NP = (cid:104)NP (cid:105). For a uniform distribution

One can see from (39) that for a narrow participant distribution, i.e. for NP1 → NP2, the scaled variance, the
normalized skewness, and the normalized kurtosis vanish or are close to 0. Therefore, we can set ωP = SPσP =
κPσ2

P = 0 for the ‘reference’ line.

The ‘A-source’ and the ‘reference’ ﬂuctuations agree except for the normalized kurtosis. The diﬀerence arise
due to the fact that ‘A-source’ ﬂuctuations are calculated for relatively wide centrality bins δc, while centrality

is ﬁxed, δc = 0, for the ‘reference’ line by deﬁnition. When the bin width decreases, δc → 0, then the ‘A-source’
and the ‘reference’ agree within the uncertainty3. The same is the reason why the ‘x’ coordinate of the ‘reference’
is diﬀerent from the ‘x’ coordinate of the ‘net charge’, ‘A-source’ and ‘participant’. The latter are shown with
the points that correspond to the average number of participants in the bin, (cid:104)NP(cid:105), while the ‘reference’ can be
calculated only for integer number of participants, and we selected NP = 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 58.
The hypothetical maximal number of participants in 40
P = 40 + 45 = 85. However,
the participant number distribution drops so fast at large NP that events with participant numbers NP > 60
are rare.

21Sc reactions is N max

The net electric charge is deﬁned by the number of participating protons, which is roughly one half of the
participant number for Ar+Sc, (cid:104)Nnet charge(cid:105)/(cid:104)N max
(cid:105) = (18 + 21)/(40 + 45) (cid:39) 0.5. The created particles are
taken into account only if they have positive rapidity, which corresponds to one half of the created system4.
Therefore, the number of particles from one source (7) should be (cid:104)nA(cid:105) = 0.5 ∗ 0.5 = 0.25. The number obtained
in this calculations is a bit larger, (cid:104)nA(cid:105) (cid:39) 0.3, and, as a natural consequence of IPM, it is independent of
centrality, see Fig. 1 right,

(40)

In spite of so small number of particles from one source, (cid:104)nA(cid:105), it’s ﬂuctuations give the main contribution to

the net charge ﬂuctuations, which are also constant at all considered centrality windows

ωA (cid:39) 3.3 ∼ ω (cid:29) ωP (cid:38) 0.5 ,

for all δc .

(41)

Although ﬂuctuations of participants are small, they exist, even if the centrality bin width approaches zero. It
means that if we choose to study total charge instead of the net charge in the same system, then we get larger

3 The fact that the IPM equations (7), (9), (10), (11) are valid for any number of participant, NP, while ‘net charge’ and ‘A-source’
ﬂuctuations agree exactly, if number of participants does not ﬂuctuate, means that EPOS 1.99 can be treated as an independent
particle production model with respect to the net electric charge ﬂuctuations in considered acceptance in spite of complicated
internal dynamics. It means that Glauber Monte-Carlo ﬂuctuations of participants dominate for the considered observables [46].
4 We do not take the whole system, because there is no net electric charge ﬂuctuations in the whole rapidity range, because of

global charge conservation.

contribution of ﬂuctuations of participants.

The skewness of a source is also independent on centrality and is close to zero, see Fig. 2 right. It justiﬁes
the approximation (28), which is necessary for the MMCP, and shows that the relatively large values of the net
charge normalized skewness are due to the second moment ﬂuctuations of participants,

SA σA (cid:39) 0.1 (cid:28) S σ (cid:39) 3 (cid:104)nA(cid:105) ωP > 0 ,

while SP σP ≤ 0 ,

for all δc .

(42)

The normalized skewness of participants, SP σP, depends on (cid:104)NP(cid:105) and is negative for all considered centralities
c < 20%. It gives a small contribution to the net charge skewness, because of the pre-factor (cid:104)nA(cid:105)2 (cid:39) 0.09, see
Eq. (10). The negative skewness of the participant distribution means that it’s mean value is on the left from
the most probable value. This is in contrast to the results of [29], which showed zero skewness of wounded
nucleon distribution in 5% − 10% most central collisions. The diﬀerence could, probably, be attributed to the
fact that we use EPOS, while in [29] the authors use another model [47]. Other possible reasons are that
Pb+Pb reactions create a symmetric system, and Pb nucleus is heavy, thus, has small corona.

The normalized kurtosis shows the bin width dependence for all types of ﬂuctuations, see Fig. 3. For large
A (cid:39) 0, while the ﬂuctuations of participants are very large and
P (cid:28) 0. However, it almost does not inﬂuence net charge ﬂuctuations, because the corresponding

centrality bins it is zero for a source, κA σ2
negative, κP σ2
term is multiplied by (cid:104)nA(cid:105)3 (cid:39) 0.027 in Eq. (11),

κ σ2 (cid:39) 3 (cid:104)nA(cid:105) ωP ωA > 0 ,

κP σ2

P (cid:28) 0 ,

for δc ≥ 7.5% .

(43)

The negative kurtosis of participants means that it’s distribution is very ﬂat at maximum. For centrality
windows smaller than 5% the normalized kurtosises for all considered values slightly grow and then decrease to
the values

P (cid:39) 1 ,

for c = 0 − 0.2% .

(44)

The discrepancy between the ‘reference’ and the MMCP in Fig. 3 comes from the fact that β (17) is not small

enough in the considered example. Therefore, Eq. (16) reads

(45)

One can safely neglect γ and δ in (45), but 2β can reach −0.25, see Fig. 1. Therefore, Eq. (37) requires the
modiﬁcation,

κA σ2

(46)

which gives the missing positive contribution, −2 β ωA κ3/κ2, to κA σ2
A in Fig. 3. However, the determination
of β requires the knowledge of SP σP. The δ and ε (26) may also be too large to be neglected. Then, one needs
more input in MMCP from a model, or from the measurements of higher ﬂuctuation moments.

Our analysis shows that the higher the order of considered moments, the stronger is the dependence on the
centrality bin width for both - the participant ﬂuctuations, and ﬂuctuations from a source. Therefore, one needs
to have a reliable estimation of these eﬀects, in order to ﬁnd the optimal bins and their widths, especially if one
compares the results in diﬀerent centrality bins (i), or uses the CBWC procedure (ii).

IV. COMPARISON OF THE MMCP AND THE CBWC METHODS

The CBWC procedure [9] means that a value X is measured in r sub-samples, and then summed up with the

relative weights wr of the sub-samples r,

X =

(cid:88)

r

wr Xr ,

wr = nr/

(cid:88)

nr ,

r

(47)

where nr is the number of events in the bin r. The width of the sub-sample r is chosen as small as possible,
which is, for example, δc = 1% in [20] and [21]. Therefore, let say, 0 − 5% centrality bin is further subdivided
into 5 bins 0 − 1%, 1 − 2%, 2 − 3%, 3 − 4%, and 4 − 5%. The value X is calculated in each sub-bin, and

10

then summed up with r running from 1 to 5. We show that the CBWC procedure fails to remove participant
ﬂuctuations, if they are non-zero for an inﬁnitely small sub-sample,

ωP,r → const = ω∗

P > 0 ,

when

δcr → 0 .

(48)

In order to explain the nature of the eﬀect, we make a few simplifying assumptions. We apply the CBWC to
the scaled variance, normalized skewness and kurtosis, instead of their ingredients. Suppose that we have the
0 − 5% centrality bin, which we divide into 5 bins with equal multiplicity, so that wr = 1/5. Assume that the
number of sources and their ﬂuctuations are constant in diﬀerent sub-bins,

(cid:104)nA,r(cid:105) = (cid:104)nA(cid:105) = const ,

ωA,r = ωA = const .

(49)

It is a realistic situation that is also realized in our Ar+Sc system, see Figs. 1 and 2. The number of particles
produced by a source, (cid:104)nA(cid:105), and the scaled variance for the ﬂuctuations from a source, ωA, are independent on
the bin width in the considered case. Then the application of CBWC (47) to the scaled variance (9) gives

ωCBWC =

If participant ﬂuctuations are also the same in diﬀerent sub-bins,

ωP,r (cid:39) ω∗

P = const ,

then the CBWC just gives the same result as ﬂuctuations in one sub-bin,

ωCBWC (cid:39) ωA + (cid:104)nA(cid:105) ω∗

P .

(50)

(51)

(52)

One can see that the ﬂuctuations of participants, ω∗
P, are still there in (52). The originally proposed CBWC is
applied on the level of mean multiplicity, (cid:104)N (cid:105), and standard deviation, σ, separately. This, however, does not
change the qualitative eﬀect,

σ =

√

κ2 = (cid:112)(cid:104)N (cid:105) ω =

(cid:113)

(cid:104)NP(cid:105) σ2

A + (cid:104)nA(cid:105)2 σ2

P ,

(53)

just the proof looks more complicated then (48-52). One can also see from Fig. 2 that there is no reason to select
the centrality bin smaller than δc = 1% for ω in the considered example, because ﬂuctuations of participants
saturate on the level about ωP = 0.4 for the ﬁve most right points around (cid:104)NP(cid:105) = 57, which correspond to
c = 0 − 1.5%, 0 − 1%, 0 − 0.75%, 0 − 0.5%, 0 − 0.2%.

For the comparison of the MMCP and the original version of the CBWC the events from the 5% most central
collisions are divided into ﬁve approximately equal sub-bins: 0 − 1%, 1 − 2%, 2 − 3%, 3 − 4% and 4 − 5%.
Next, quantities nr, wr (cid:39) 1/5 = 0.2, N , σ, S and κ are obtained. Then the values σ2/(cid:104)N (cid:105) = ω = κ2/(cid:104)N (cid:105),
S σ = κ3/κ2 and κ σ2 = κ4/κ2 are calculated for each sub-bin. Finally, the CBWC (47) is used to sum up the
sub-bin values and obtain the values for the whole 0 − 5% bin, see the last line in Table I. The obtained CBWC

The CBWC procedure reduces statistical uncertainty, but overestimates scaled variance, normalized skewness
and normalized kurtosis three times. In fact, the CBWC gives the average of net charge ﬂuctuations over the
selected sub-bins. One may notice that all the values in Table I monotonously change with the bin, except for
κ σ2 in the 0 − 1% bin. Therefore, our selection of relatively equal sub-bins statistics gives wr (cid:39) 0.2, which
leads to almost the same values in the ﬁnal 0 − 5% bin, and in the middle 2 − 3% bin. A diﬀerent selection of
weights, wr, would lead to a diﬀerent results. Therefore, the CBWC depends also on the particular weights and
bins selected for the CBWC. Although the diﬀerence is small for the scaled variance, the normalized skewness
and kurtosis is overestimated by three times after the CBWC, compared ‘reference’ or ‘A-source’ in Table II.

The MMCP method works good for the scaled variance. For the 0−5% centrality the MMCP coincides within
the uncertainty with the A-source values obtained using the complete knowledge of the participant ﬂuctuations.
For the 0 − 20% centrality the scaled variance calculated in the MMCP deviates from the A-source only by two
percents. The normalized skewness of sources is zero by deﬁnition in the current version of the MMCP, see
Eq. (28). It agrees within three standard deviations with the ‘A-source’ generated by EPOS. The normalized
kurtosis in MMCP underestimates the ‘A-source’ values, becoming closer to it, when the bin width decreases.
The MMCP formula for the normalized kurtosis (37) works better than ﬁxing the bin width, but worse than
Eq. (36) for the scaled variance ω = κ2/(cid:104)N (cid:105). This is the result of the fact that skewness of the participants,
SP σP, can not be neglected in Eqs. (36) and (37) and (28), as is assumed in Eq. (17). Still, the obtained value
is closer to the ‘A-source’ than the ‘net charge’.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The MMCP (36), (37) works well for the considered example. The scaled variance calculated by the MMCP
in the 0 − 5% centrality bin coincides with the ﬂuctuations from a source, as if there were no participant
ﬂuctuations. For the widest considered 0 − 20% centrality the MMCP gives just 2% error. It makes possible
to use the MMCP almost independently of the event centrality selection.
It encourages us to look for the
improvements of the MMCP by considering the moments higher then the current four. It should help to ﬁnd
better approximations for the third and the fourth moments of the source. It seems also to be interesting to
test the current MMCP on symmetric systems like Pb+Pb, which could produce a symmetric distribution of
participants, i.e. with zero skewness. We leave it for the future studies.

In the current example the average number of particles produced by a source, (cid:104)nA(cid:105), and it’s ﬂuctuations of
the second, ωA, and the third order, SA σA, do not depend on the centrality bin width in the considered system.
However, the fourth order ﬂuctuations of a source, κA σ2
A, change non-monotonously for the bin width smaller
than 5% in the range from −1 to +1. This change is clearly visible in all dependencies - ‘net charge’, ‘A-source’

12

and ‘reference’. Therefore, the eﬀect should be taken into account for the fourth moment, and further studied
for higher moments.

The S σ and κ σ2 depend on the lower order ﬂuctuations, which give the largest contribution to their values.

The ﬂuctuations from a source that one would like to access, SA σA and κA σ2

A, are almost zero:

S σ (cid:39) 3 (cid:104)nA(cid:105) ωP > 0 ,

κ σ2 (cid:39) 3 (cid:104)nA(cid:105) ωP ωA > 0 ,

SA σA (cid:39) 0 ,

κA σ2

A (cid:39) 0 .

(54)

The CBWC reduces statistical uncertainties, but is unable to remove participant ﬂuctuations. It gives the
average of the ‘net charge’, i.e. non-processed ﬂuctuations, which are dominated by participant ﬂuctuations.
The result of the CBWC application depends on the width, weight, and the position of the sub-bins. If a source
is sensitive for the centrality selection, as it is the case for the normalized kurtosis κA σ2
A for the bin width
smaller than 5%, then the application of the CBWC may give arbitrary result. The same is true if one does not
mix the bins, but selects a particular centrality bin and increases statistics. The ﬂuctuations of participants
may persist even for the bin width that approaches zero.
