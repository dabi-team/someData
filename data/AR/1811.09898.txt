We measure the detailed spatiotemporal profiles of femtosecond laser pulses in the infrared wavelength range 
,  and  the  absolute  nonlinear  response  of  major  air  constituents  (N2,  O2,  and  Ar)  over  this 
range. The spatiotemporal measurements reveal wavelength-dependent pulse front tilt and temporal stretching

in the infrared pulses. 

There is increasing development of intense short pulse laser sources from the mid-infrared (MIR) through 
the  long  wave-infrared  (LWIR)  region.  These  include  nonlinear  optics-based  sources  such  as  optical 
parametric amplification (OPA) [1],  difference frequency generation (DFG) [2], and optical parametric 
chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA) [3], as well as solid state gain media  [4], and high pressure CO2 gas 
lasers  [5].  The existence of air transparency windows within the MIR-LWIR range  [6] has motivated the 
study  of  their  propagation  in  atmosphere  and  applications  such  as  remote  sensing  in  the  molecular 
fingerprint  region [7],  high  harmonic  generation [8]  and  shaped  multi-octave  supercontinuum 
generation [9]. Important to all these applications is nonlinear propagation, which depends on the near-
instantaneous (electronic) and delayed (rotational, vibrational) nonlinear responses of the medium. For the 
50-300fs MIR-LWIR pulses of this experiment, the electronic and rotational responses dominate; the non-
resonant Raman vibrational response of O2 and N2 is negligible owing to insufficient optical bandwidth.  

In  this  Article  we  present  measurements  of  the  detailed  spatiotemporal  profiles  of  femtosecond  laser 
pulses in the infrared wavelength range 
, and the absolute nonlinear response of major air 
constituents (N2, O2, and Ar) over this range. We also investigate possible resonant 2-photon vibrational 
excitation of N2 near λ=8µm, which is of interest for high power LWIR laser pulse propagation [10]. The 
spatiotemporal  measurements  reveal  the  wavelength-dependent  pulse  front  tilt  and  temporal  stretching 
induced by the difference frequency generation scheme used to generate the infrared pulses.

There is a paucity of absolute nonlinear response measurements in the MIR and LWIR. Recent work 

includes measurements by our group of the nonlinear response of air constituents in the range 

  [11]  using  single  shot  supercontinuum  spectral  interferometry  (SSSI)  [12-15],  which  enables 
𝜆𝜆 = 0.4 −
separation of electronic and rotational contributions to the total nonlinearity. For λ
 pulses, the total

electronic plus rotational response of  major air constituents and noble gases was measured  [16, 17] using 
four-wave mixing of two rotational lines from a 200ps CO2 laser pulse. In that case, the long pulsewidth 
and prevented separation of the electronic and rotational contributions.

Here,  we  use  SSSI  to  measure  the  space  and  time-resolved  nonlinear  phase  shift  imparted  on  a  weak 
supercontinuum (SC) probe pulse by the MIR-LWIR pump pulse-induced refractive index shift in the gases studied. 
As discussed in [11],  the extracted nondegenerate nonlinearity coefficients are within ~5% of their degenerate MIR 
counterparts., with even better agreement in the LWIR.  As depicted in Fig. 1, the MIR-LWIR pump at  λ

  In conclusion, we have measured the electronic nonlinear index 

 of the major air constituents Ar, O2, 
and N2 in the MIR-LWIR range λ=2.5-11µm and presented spatiotemporal profiles of these pulses. The 
values of

time  to  our  knowledge,  the  pulse  front  tilt  and  temporal  broadening  produced  by  difference  frequency 
generation and dispersion of femtosecond infrared laser pulses.
