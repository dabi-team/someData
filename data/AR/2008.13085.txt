Abstract Time series of photospheric magnetic parameters of solar active re-
gions (ARs) are used to answer whether scaling properties of ﬂuctuations embed-
ded in such time series help to distinguish between ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring ARs.
We examine a total of 118 ﬂare-quiet and 118 ﬂaring AR patches (called HARPs),
which were observed from 2010 to 2016 by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Speciﬁcally, the scaling
exponent of ﬂuctuations is derived applying the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
(DFA) method to a dataset of 8-day time series of 18 photospheric magnetic
parameters at 12-min cadence for all HARPs under investigation. We ﬁrst ﬁnd a
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the distribution of the scaling exponent be-
tween the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs, in particular for some space-averaged,
signed parameters associated with magnetic ﬁeld line twist, electric current den-
sity, and current helicity. The ﬂaring HARPs tend to show higher values of the
scaling exponent compared to those of the ﬂare-quiet ones, even though there
is considerable overlap between their distributions. In addition, for both the
ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs the DFA analysis indicates that (1) time series of
most of various magnetic parameters under consideration are non-stationary, and
(2) time series of the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux and the mean photospheric

property, while the total unsigned ﬂux near magnetic polarity inversion lines
and parameters related to current density show a non-stationary, anti-persistent
trend in their time series.

1. Introduction

Solar active regions (ARs) have been intensively studied in the last few decades
in the context of how their magnetic ﬁeld properties are related to ﬂare produc-
tivity, mainly using a snapshot of a photospheric line-of-sight or vector magne-
togram (e.g. Leka and Barnes, 2003, 2007; Georgoulis and Rust, 2007; Falconer
et al., 2011; Bobra and Couvidat, 2015; Toriumi et al., 2017), as well as a
sequence of magnetograms over an interval of a few hours to days (e.g. Welsch
et al., 2009; Park et al., 2008; Park, Chae, and Wang, 2010; Lee, Park, and
Moon, 2018). As a result, it was found that magnetic ﬁelds of ﬂaring ARs are
more likely to exhibit: (1) morphological complexity (e.g. highly fragmented
delta-sunspots), (2) higher degrees of magnetic non-potentiality in a wide variety
of forms (e.g. magnetic shear, electric currents, free magnetic energy), and (3)
dynamic evolution in the pre-ﬂare state (e.g. rapid ﬂux emergence, sustained
cancellation at sheared magnetic polarity inversion lines). Even though such AR
magnetic ﬁeld studies advanced our understanding of ﬂare-productive ARs (see
review by Toriumi and Wang, 2019, and references therein), many eﬀorts are
still under way to better discriminate between ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring ARs.

There have been time series studies of AR photospheric magnetic parameters
to ﬁnd out diﬀerences in temporal variations of magnetic ﬁeld properties between
ARs at diﬀerent levels of ﬂare activity, in particular with respect to ﬂare energy
build-up and triggering mechanisms over the course of AR evolution. For exam-
ple, the superposed epoch analysis (e.g. Mason and Hoeksema, 2010; Schrijver,
2016) was applied to time series of some photospheric magnetic parameters of
ﬂaring ARs, in order to examine any characteristic trend in the time series
around the ﬂare occurrence time. Recently, examining 8-day time series of various
photospheric magnetic parameters for a total of 93 ﬂare-productive ARs, Lee,
Park, and Moon (2018) found that the examined time series tend to show larger
mean values as well as larger ﬂuctuations over a wide range of timescales (i.e.,
tens of minutes to 1 day) for ARs at higher levels of ﬂare productivity.

Extending the study by Lee, Park, and Moon (2018), we examine here the
following speciﬁc question: “Do scaling properties of ﬂuctuations presented in
time series of AR photospheric magnetic parameters help to distinguish be-
tween ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring ARs?” Note that scaling properties (also called
temporal fractal properties) of time series can be measured by scaling exponents
which represent the relationship between ﬂuctuations at diﬀerent timescales. The
scaling exponent increases as ﬂuctuations at shorter/longer timescales become
smaller/larger. The scaling exponents can also be considered as a quantitative
measure of long-range correlation or persistence in time series: i.e., the higher

SOLA: ms.tex; 1 September 2020; 0:56; p. 2

Time Series Analysis of Active Region Photospheric Magnetic Parameters

the scaling exponent, the higher the level of long-range correlation or persistence.
Such scaling properties have been studied across a wide variety of diﬀerent
time series (e.g. Vandewalle and Ausloos, 1997; Eke et al., 2000; Lam et al.,
2005; Suyal, Prasad, and Singh, 2009; MacLachlan et al., 2013), in particular
to identify an underlying physical mechanism which may be responsible for the
scaling property estimated from a given time series (e.g. Ma et al., 2010). In
this respect, we speculate that scaling properties of time varying AR magnetic
properties may capture a diﬀerence in the magnetic ﬁeld evolution of ﬂare-quiet
versus ﬂaring ARs if any exists. For example, in the case of temporal variations
in the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux, ﬂaring ARs may exhibit higher values of
scaling exponents compared to those of ﬂare-quiet ARs, because ﬂaring ARs
often show persistent ﬂux variations (either increase or decrease in relation to
ﬂux emergence or cancellation) over timescales of a few hours to days before
ﬂare occurrence.

To address the targeted question of this study, we examine 8-day time series
of numerous photospheric magnetic parameters for a total of 236 diﬀerent AR
patches (i.e. 118 ﬂare-quiet and 118 ﬂaring AR patches). Speciﬁcally, scaling
exponents of ﬂuctuations in the AR photospheric magnetic parameter time series
are estimated using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA; Peng et al., 1994,
1995). DFA is a widely used method to quantify scaling exponents of various
time series datasets (e.g. Peng et al., 1994, 1995; Vandewalle and Ausloos,
1997; Kantelhardt et al., 2002; Király and Jánosi, 2005; Telesca, Lasaponara,
and Lanorte, 2008; Hardstone et al., 2012; Holloway et al., 2014; Guo et al.,
2015). Details of how DFA is applied to the magnetic parameter time series are
explained in Section 2. The analysis results are shown in Section 3, including
(1) distribution of DFA scaling exponents for each of the examined photospheric
magnetic parameter time series and (2) comparison of DFA scaling exponents
between the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring AR patches under study. In Section 4, we
discuss why scaling exponents of diﬀerent magnetic parameter time series show
diﬀerent levels of discriminating the ﬂaring AR patches from the others.

2. Data and Analysis

The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al., 2012) on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin,
2012) routinely produces full-disk, photospheric vector magnetograms with a
spatial resolution of 0.5 arcsec per pixel and 12-min cadence. A total of 18
photospheric magnetic parameters of ARs are derived from HMI photospheric
vector magnetic ﬁeld data and available as part of the Space-weather HMI Active
Region Patch/Cylindrical Equal Area (SHARP/CEA; Bobra et al., 2014) prod-
ucts. Details of the 18 SHARP magnetic parameters can be found in Table 1.
In this study, we use the 18 SHARP parameters and their time series. Note
that the SHARP parameters are determined for a given HMI AR Patch (HARP;
Hoeksema et al., 2014), only considering high-conﬁdence pixels (i.e. HMI FITS
header keyword CONF_DISAMBIG = 90) within a smooth bounding curve (i.e. HMI
keyword BITMAP ≥ 33) deﬁned inside the rectangular HARP bounding box. The

SOLA: ms.tex; 1 September 2020; 0:56; p. 3

E.-J. Lee et al.

total number of high-conﬁdence pixels in HARPs tends to signiﬁcantly decrease
as they are located closer to the solar limb (Hoeksema et al., 2014; Bobra and
Couvidat, 2015). We therefore restricted here the use of the SHARP parameters,
as calculated only from HARPs of which the centre positions are within ±60◦
from the central meridian (hereafter, referred to as Θ60).

We searched for HARPs that were continuously observed over 8 days within
Θ60 during an interval from May 2010 to February 2016. We ﬁrst found a set of
118 ﬂaring HARPs, in which each HARP produced at least one M- or X-class
ﬂare throughout its passage of Θ60. For comparison, the other set of 118 ﬂare-
quiet HARPs that never produced any ﬂares at and above C-class over their
entire solar disk passage was also collected; it was constructed in the way that
the total number of the ﬂare-quiet HARPs per year is almost equally distributed
over the years of the same interval under consideration to search for the ﬂaring
HARPs. Each of the ﬂare-quiet HARPs under investigation is assigned with one
NOAA AR; however, in the case of the ﬂaring HARPs, half of them contain two
or more NOAA ARs for a given HARP. A total of the 236 HARPs consisting of
the 118 ﬂare-quiet and 118 ﬂaring HARPs were selected in this study to examine
the targeted question of whether there are any diﬀerences in scaling properties
of SHARP parameter time series of ﬂare-quiet versus ﬂaring ARs.

For each of the 236 HARPs under consideration, we analyzed a set of 8-day
time series of the 18 SHARP parameters using the same analysis method as in
Lee, Park, and Moon (2018). Each 8-day time series X of the SHARP parameters
consists of 960 data points at 12-min cadence: i.e. X = [X1, X2, X3, . . . , X960].
For the time series X, the scaling exponent is calculated using the DFA method.
A major advantage of the DFA method is that it is designed to determine the
scaling exponent of any time series regardless of whether the underlying statistics
(such as mean and variance) of the time series present stationary (constant over
time) or non-stationary (changing with time) characteristics. Mandelbrot and
van Ness (1968) introduced the fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) and fractional
Brownian motion (fBm) to model stationary and non-stationary time series,
respectively, with the so-called Hurst scaling exponent H. The Hurst exponent
is a measure of long-term memory (or persistence) of a given time series, and
it ranges from 0 to 1. In principle, successive increments of a non-stationary
fBm time series with a given value of H can be considered as a stationary fGn
time series with the same H value (Tarnopolski, 2016). Time series can be in
general classiﬁed into three diﬀerent categories, depending on the values of the
Hurst exponent derived from the given time series: anti-persistent (0 < H < 0.5),
random (H = 0.5), and persistent (0.5 < H < 1). Figure 1 shows examples of
both fGn (left panels) and fBm (right panels) times series with diﬀerent Hurst
exponents. In general, time series of both fGn and fBm have a tendency to
be more rough as H gets closer to 0, while more smooth as H is closer to 1
(Hardstone et al., 2012). As shown in Figure 1, anti-persistent time series (top
panels) show a tendency of an increase followed by a decrease (or vice versa)
over a short timescale (i.e. large ﬂuctuation). On the other hand, persistent time
series (bottom panels) tend to exhibit an increase followed by a decrease (or vice
versa) over a longer timescale. Meanwhile, successive variations on random time
series (middle panels) are uncorrelated to each other. The scaling exponent α

Time Series Analysis of Active Region Photospheric Magnetic Parameters

calculated from the DFA method has been related to the Hurst exponent (e.g.
Eke et al., 2000; Hardstone et al., 2012): H = α in the case of fGn time series
and H = α − 1 for fBm time series. In the present study, the scaling property of
a given SHARP parameter time series refers to the DFA scaling exponent α.

We now demonstrate in Figure 2 how α is calculated from a SHARP parameter
time series. Figure 2a shows the 8-day time series X of the absolute value of the
net current helicity (i.e. ABSNJZH in Table 1) in the HARP number 5011.
The cumulative sum Y = [Y1, Y2, Y3, . . . , Y960] is ﬁrst calculated from X by
integration of a sequence X − ¯X as

where ¯X is the mean of X. In Figure 2b, Y is shown by the black solid line.
Y is then divided into non-overlapping segments of the equal length n = 120.
For each segment, a local linear trend ˜Y(n = 120) (red lines in Figure 2b) is
determined by least-squares straight-line ﬁt. Next the detrended ﬂuctuation
˜F(n = 120) is calculated by the root-mean square of the detrended cumulative
sum (i.e. Y − ˜Y(n = 120), Figure 2c) as

˜F(n = 120) =

Calculating ˜F(n) for a set of n = [4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120], we
estimated α as the slope of least-squares straight-line ﬁt between ˜F(n) and n in
a log-log plot (Figure 2d).

Prior to applying the DFA method to SHARP parameter time series, we
examined how well the DFA method estimates α for both stationary (fGn) and
non-stationary (fBm) time series with a diﬀerent number of missing data points.
For this, fBm time series are synthesized for H values from 0 to 1 at an interval
of 0.05, using the “wfbm” function in the Matlab (Abry and Sellan, 1996; Bardet
et al., 2003). For a given H value, we make 1,000 diﬀerent fBm time series of
which each consists of 960 data points. Some data points in the time series
are randomly selected and replaced with NaN (Not a Number) values to make
missing data points. The number of missing data points in SHARP parameter
time series varies depending on the HARP and SHARP parameter under investi-
gation. For all examined HARPs in this study, the number of missing data points
included in each USFLUX time series is ∼32 on average, while the median is
∼12. Figure 3a shows the mean and the standard deviation of the DFA scaling
exponent αfBm estimated from the fBm time series as a function of H for the
three diﬀerent sets of fBm time series with no (black), 12 (red), and 32 (blue)
missing data points. For the fBm time series without any missing data point,
in general, the linear relationship (black line in Figure 3a) between H + 1 and
αfBm appears to be strong in a substantial range of H + 1 values, except for a
slight deviation from the dashed diagonal line (indicating a theoretical linear
relationship between H + 1 and αfBm) in the range of H + 1 < 1.3. For the fBm

SOLA: ms.tex; 1 September 2020; 0:56; p. 5

E.-J. Lee et al.

times series with the missing data points, however, this linear relationship does
not become valid in the range of H + 1 > 1.5. Next, fGn time series are derived
from successive increments of the fBm time series. For fGn time series, as shown
in Figure 3b, a much stronger linear relationship exists between H and αfGn for
all three diﬀerent set of fGn time series regardless of the number of missing data
points in the time series. Note that αfGn is somewhat overestimated (0.05–0.2)
compared to the dashed diagonal line in the range of H < 0.3.

In principle, α from the fBm or fGn time series should have a linear relation-
ship with H. However, a deviation appears mainly due to missing data existed
in time series and/or uncertainties in estimating α using the DFA method. For
the fBm and fGn time series with 12 NaNs, Figure 3 shows that the deviation
from the dashed diagonal line for αfGn becomes larger than that for αfBm in
the range of H < 0.32; i.e. for H = 0.32, its corresponding αfGn with 12 NaNs is
0.369. We therefore determine α in this study as follows. First, αfBm is calculated
from a given original SHARP parameter time series. If αfBm ≤ 1, then αfBm is
considered as α. On the other hand, in the case of αfBm > 1, αfGn is calculated
from successive increments of the SHARP parameter time series. If αfGn < 0.369,
then αfBm is taken into account as α; otherwise, αfGn + 1 as α.

3. Results

The DFA scaling exponent α was calculated from each 8-day time series of all
18 SHARP parameters for each of the 118 ﬂare-quiet and 118 ﬂaring HARPs
observed from May 2010 to February 2016. For a given SHARP parameter,
Figure 4 shows the frequency distribution of α values for the ﬂare-quiet (blue
bars) and ﬂaring HARPs (red bars), respectively. The distributions of α values
tend to be left-skewed for most of the SHARP parameters but right-skewed for
the mean vertical current density MEANJZD; on the other hand, in the case of
the SHARP parameter R_VALUE, α values show a symmetric distribution. We
deﬁne six subgroups according to α values as follows: 0.0 ≤ α < 0.4 (stationary
and anti-persistent), 0.4 ≤ α < 0.6 (stationary and random), 0.6 ≤ α < 1.0 (sta-
tionary and persistent), 1.0 ≤ α < 1.4 (non-stationary and anti-persistent, A),
1.4 ≤ α < 1.6 (non-stationary and random, R), and 1.6 ≤ α < 2.0 (non-stationary
and persistent, P ). Table 2 shows percentage distributions of α values categorized
into the subgroups for the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs, respectively. Note
that none of the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs have α values less than 0.6.
The SHARP parameters are grouped as P P , RP , RR, AR, or AA, considering
the subgroup with the highest percentage (marked in bold in Table 2) for the
ﬂare-quiet (ﬁrst letter) and ﬂaring HARPs (second letter), respectively.

We ﬁnd that the SHARP parameter time series are predominantly non-
stationary for both the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs (refer to Figure 4 and
Table 2). This indicates that most of the SHARP parameter time series show
some long-term (a few tens of hours to a few days) variations during the disk
passage of the HARPs. It is also found that the ﬂaring HARPs tend to show
relatively higher α values than those of the ﬂare-quiet HARPs. Moreover, for
some SHARP parameter time series, we ﬁnd the following three characteristics

SOLA: ms.tex; 1 September 2020; 0:56; p. 6

Time Series Analysis of Active Region Photospheric Magnetic Parameters

in the context of their persistent, random or anti-persistent properties: (1) the
total unsigned magnetic ﬂux USFLUX and the mean photospheric magnetic free
energy density MEANPOT show the persistent property in their time series for
a majority of the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs, (2) the time series of the mean
characteristic twist parameter MEANALP and the two current helicity param-
eters ABSNJZH and MEANJZH tend to be anti-persistent for the ﬂare-quiet
HARPs, while random for the ﬂaring HARPs, and (3) MEANJZD, R_VALUE,
and the sum of the absolute value of the net current per polarity SAVNCPP show
a strong tendency of the anti-persistent property for most of the ﬂare-quiet and
ﬂaring HARPs.

For comparison with α, we take into account the mean ¯X of a given SHARP
parameter time series. Figure 5 shows in each panel the frequency distribu-
tion of ¯X values for the ﬂare-quiet (blue bars) and ﬂaring HARPs (red bars),
respectively, for each of the examined SHARP parameters. As shown in the
distributions of α values in Figure 4, the ﬂaring HARPs in general show larger
¯X values compared to the ﬂare-quiet HARPs for most of the SHARP param-
eters, while the opposite trend appears in the case of the mean gradients of
the total/vertical ﬁelds MEANGBT/MEANGBZ and the mean vertical current
density MEANJZD. ¯X values show a right-skewed distribution for many of the
SHARP parameters; in many cases, for the ﬂare-quiet HARPs the distributions
have a peak at the bin including the minimum value. In addition, we ﬁnd in many
qualitative aspects that the distributions of ¯X values for the ﬂaring HARPs are
more diﬀerentiated from those for the ﬂare-quiet HARPs with respect to several
space-integrated unsigned SHARP parameters such as USFLUX, TOTUSJZ,
TOTUSJH, TOTPOT, R_VALUE, and AREA_ACR.

Another graphical way to present distribution characteristics of α values is to
use a box and whisker plot. In Figure 6, each panel shows box and whisker plots
for α values of the ﬂare-quiet (left) and ﬂaring HARPs (right), respectively,
calculated from time series of a given SHARP parameter. The horizontal bar
inside each box indicates the median of the α distribution, and the bottom and
top lines of the box are the ﬁrst and third quartiles (i.e. α1st and α3rd). If the
minimum/maximum value exists within the range extended from the ﬁrst/third
quartile to 1.5 × [α3rd − α1st] above/below, then the bottom/top whisker outside
the box is located at the minimum/maximum value; otherwise, the whiskers are
plotted at α1st − 1.5 × [α3rd − α1st] and α3rd + 1.5 × [α3rd − α1st]. All data points
located outside of the whiskers are marked with circles. Figure 6 shows that
α1st for the ﬂaring HARPs is even larger than α3rd for the ﬂare-quiet HARPs
in the case of several SHARP parameters such as MEANGBH, MEANALP,
MEANJZH, ABSNJZH, SAVNCPP, and R_VALUE. In Figure 7, the same box
and whisker plots are shown for ¯X values, which can be compared with those
for α values in Figure 6. As in Figure 6, we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst quartile of ¯X
values for the ﬂaring HARPs is larger than the third quartile of those for the
ﬂare-quiet HARPs for some SHARP parameters such as USFLUX, TOTUSJZ,
TOTUSJH, ABSNJZH, SAVNCPP, TOTPOT, R_VALUE, and AREA_ACR.
ABSNJZH, SAVNCPP, and R_VALUE seem to perform well to diﬀerentiate
between the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs, using α as well as ¯X, in the respect
of the comparison of the third quartile of the ﬂare-quiet HARPs with the ﬁrst

SOLA: ms.tex; 1 September 2020; 0:56; p. 7

E.-J. Lee et al.

quartile of the ﬂaring ones. On the other hand, in the context of the potential
of discriminating ﬂare-quiet HARPs from ﬂaring ones, a tendency is found that
some space-averaged, signed SHARP parameters (e.g. MEANALP and MEAN-
JZH) work better in the case of α, while space-integrated, unsigned parameters
for ¯X (e.g. USFLUX, TOTUSJZ, TOTUSJH, TOTPOT, and AREA_ACR).

We performed the Student’s t-test to quantitatively examine whether two sets
of α values (one for the ﬂare-quiet HARPs and the other for the ﬂaring HARPs),
as well as two sets of ¯X values (again, for the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs,
respectively), are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other. As a result of the t-test
on the given two datasets, a t-value is calculated, which measures the diﬀerence
between the means of the two datasets divided by the standard error of the
mean diﬀerence. The calculated t-value is presented in parenthesis next to the
given SHARP parameter keyword in each panel of Figures 6 and 7, respectively.
In this study, the sign of the t-value is deﬁned to be positive when the mean
of the ﬂaring HARPs is larger than that of the ﬂare-quiet HARPs. Throughout
the t-test, we also calculated the p-value, i.e., the probability of accepting the
null hypothesis that the means of the two datasets are equal. We ﬁrst ﬁnd
that p-values for all SHARP parameters are less than ∼0.05, which indicates
there is a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the mean of the two datasets
between the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs for both cases of α and ¯X. For most
SHARP parameters, the ﬂaring HARPs typically show higher α and/or ¯X values
compared to the ﬂare-quiet HARPs so that their t-values are positive and in the
range of 2 to 14. Table 3 shows the t-test results (i.e., t-values and p-values) for
all SHARP parameters, and four best-discriminating parameters are highlighted
for α and ¯X, respectively. Interestingly, as found in the box and whisker plots,
the same trend appears that the space-averaged, signed parameters, MEANALP
and MEANJZH, are listed as the best-discriminating parameters in the case of α,
while for ¯X the space-integrated, unsigned parameters, TOTUSJZ, TOTUSJH,
AREA_ACR, and USFLUX.

4. Summary and Discussions

This study was motivated from the question of whether scaling properties of
ﬂuctuations in AR photospheric magnetic parameter time series help to distin-
guish between ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring ARs. To answer the question, using the
DFA method, we determined the scaling exponent α of each 8-day time series
of all 18 SHARP parameters for each of 118 ﬂare-quiet and 118 ﬂaring HARPs
observed from 2010 to 2016. The mean ¯X calculated from the same 8-day time
series was also considered for comparison. Our major ﬁndings can be summarized
as follows:

(i) The distributions of the DFA scaling exponent α between the ﬂare-quiet
and ﬂaring HARPs show a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence, even if there
is considerable overlap between their distributions, in particular in the
case of the space-averaged, signed SHARP parameters such as the mean
characteristic twist parameter MEANALP and the mean vertical current
helicity MEANJZH;

SOLA: ms.tex; 1 September 2020; 0:56; p. 8

Time Series Analysis of Active Region Photospheric Magnetic Parameters

(ii) For all SHARP parameters, the ﬂaring HARPs tend to show higher α values

than the ﬂare-quiet HARPs;

(iii) For both the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs, most of the SHARP parameter
time series show long-term (a few tens of hours to a few days) variations
(i.e. non-stationary);

(iv) Time series of the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux USFLUX and the mean
photospheric magnetic free energy density MEANPOT present a persistent
property, while the total unsigned ﬂux near magnetic polarity inversion
lines R_VALUE, the mean vertical current density MEANJZD, and the
sum of the absolute value of the net current per polarity SAVNCPP show
an anti-persistent trend in their time series.

Characteristic patterns of variation have been identiﬁed in time series of a
variety of AR magnetic parameters over the dynamic evolution of ﬂaring ARs
(Deng et al., 2001; Romano and Zuccarello, 2007; Park et al., 2008; Ravindra
et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2012; Song et al., 2013; Suthar et al., 2014; Vemareddy,
Venkatakrishnan, and Karthikreddy, 2015). In this study, we found that most
of the 8-day time series of the 18 SHARP parameters show long-term variations
for both the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs. As reported, there is a 24-hour
variation in the HMI magnetic ﬁeld products due to the orbital velocity of
SDO relative to the Sun (Hoeksema et al., 2014; Couvidat et al., 2016). To
understand how signiﬁcant the 24-hour variation is and whether it can make
a large inﬂuence in estimating α from the DFA method, we ﬁrst determine
the maximum absolute amplitude of spectral components with periods between
24±3 hours applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the 8-day SHARP
parameter time series. For all SHARP parameter time series, the median of the
maximum absolute amplitude values is found to be ∼11% of their interquartile
ranges (i.e. diﬀerence between the 1st and 3rd quartiles: X3rd − X1st). Then, for
the set of the fBm and fGn time series used in Section 2, we add a sinusoidal
function with a period of 24 hours and an amplitude of 0.11 × [X3rd − X1st]. In
the case of the fBm and fGn time series with 12 missing data points, α values
calculated from the fBm and fGn added with the sinusoidal function are found to
be slightly overestimated (0.01–0.09) for H < 0.75 compared to the fBm and fGn
without adding the sinusoidal function, while somewhat overestimated (0.09–
0.27) for H > 0.75. Note that α values are in general distributed in the range of
H < 0.75 for most SHARP parameters which show high levels of discriminating
the ﬂaring HARPs from the ﬂare-quiet ones. It is therefore thought that the
24-hour variation which might be embedded in the SHARP parameter time
series as a consequence of the SDO geosynchronous orbit does not signiﬁcantly
aﬀect the main results in this study. In addition, we test how sensitive the
estimation of α is to the centre-to-limb variation of the HMI observables, which
is another systematic error embedded in X (Hoeksema et al., 2014). For this,
three 4-day segments are extracted from each of the 8-day SHARP parame-
ter time series as follows: [X1, X2, X3, . . . , X480], [X241, X242, X243, . . . , X720], and
[X481, X482, X483, . . . , X960], corresponding to the intervals when the centre po-
sition of the given HARP is located within about −60–0◦, −30–30◦, and 0–60◦,

SOLA: ms.tex; 1 September 2020; 0:56; p. 9

E.-J. Lee et al.

respectively. Estimating α for each segment (i.e., α1st, α2nd, and α3rd for the
ﬁrst, second, and third segments), we ﬁnd that α1st − α2nd and α3rd − α2nd is, on
average, 0.02 and 0.01, respectively, for all SHARP parameter time series studied
here. The diﬀerence between α values estimated from the diﬀerent segments is
very small compared to α values themselves so that the α estimation is not
thought to be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the centre-to-limb variation.

For all SHARP parameters, the distribution of α shows based on the statistical
signiﬁcance test (i.e. Student’s t-test) that the ﬂaring HARPs have relatively
higher α values than the ﬂare-quiet HARPs. This indicates that the temporal
behavior of the SHARP parameter time series is diﬀerent between the ﬂare-quiet
and the ﬂaring HARPs. In other words, the ﬂare-quiet HARPs tend to show
larger ﬂuctuations on shorter timescales (several tens of minutes to a few hours)
and/or less ﬂuctuations on longer timescales (24 hours to a few days), compared
to the ﬂaring HARPs. This may be again associated with the characteristic
variations patterns (in general, long-term scales of a few days) which were found
mainly in ﬂaring ARs but not in ﬂare-quiet ARs (e.g. Park et al., 2008; Park,
Chae, and Wang, 2010).

We ﬁnd that the time series of some space-integrated, unsigned SHARP
parameters, such as USFLUX, TOTPOT, and TOTUSJZ, show the persistent
property, in particular for the ﬂaring HARPs; these extensive parameters reﬂect
the size of ARs (Welsch et al., 2009). On the other hand, space-averaged, signed
parameters, such as MEANJZD, MEANJZH, and MEANALP, show the anti-
persistent trend for the ﬂare-quiet HARPs. In the case of ﬂare-quiet ARs, it
is typically shown that the spatial distribution of signed magnetic ﬁeld prop-
erties is well balanced between positive and negative values (e.g. Kontogiannis
et al., 2017, 2018, 2019), which may account for the anti-persistent property in
their time series; i.e. short-term ﬂuctuation becomes larger in order to manage
to balance the given signed property of positive and negative values. There
have been several studies (e.g. Bobra and Couvidat, 2015; Lim et al., 2019)
in which instantaneous and/or time-averaged values of space-averaged, signed
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld parameters are used to diﬀerentiate between the
ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring ARs; consequently, such parameters are found to be not
as useful as space-integrated, unsigned parameters. However, in our study, space-
averaged, signed SHARP parameters, such as MEANALP and MEANJZH, show
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in α distributions between the ﬂare-quiet and
ﬂaring HARPs, which suggests using scaling properties of ﬂuctuations embedded
in time series of AR magnetic ﬁeld parameters may lead to improvement in
performance of ﬂare forecasting.

Finally, it will be interesting to examine whether/how scaling properties of
time series ﬂuctuations are related to spatial fractal properties in the context
of AR ﬂaring activity. For example, Georgoulis (2012) reported that there is
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in fractal properties of photospheric line-of-sight mag-
netograms between ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring ARs. In the time series of USFLUX
under our study, we ﬁnd a similar result that α values show little discrimination
between the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs. Would spatial fractal properties
be diﬀerent between the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring HARPs in the case of two-
dimensional maps for other SHARP parameters that explicitly show good dis-
crimination? This question will be answered in our future study investigating,

Note: The four subgroups are deﬁned as ranges of their α values as follows: stationary (0.6 ≤ α < 1.0),
non-stationary and anti-persistent (1.0 ≤ α < 1.4), non-stationary and random (1.4 ≤ α < 1.6), and non-
stationary and persistent (1.6 ≤ α < 2.0). The type (ﬁrst column) of each SHARP parameter is deﬁned,
considering the subgroup with the highest percentage (marked in bold) for the ﬂare-quiet (ﬁrst letter)
and ﬂaring HARPs (second letter), respectively.

Figure 1. Examples of the fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) and fractional Brownian motion
(fBm) for three diﬀerent values of Hurst scaling exponent H: (top) H = 0.2, (middle) H = 0.5,
and (bottom) H = 0.8. The fBm time series (right column) are synthesized by the “wfbm”
function in the Matlab and the fGn time series (left column) are calculated from successive
increments of the fBm time series.

Figure 2. Example of calculating the DFA exponent α. Panel (a) shows the 8-day time series
X (black line) of the SHARP parameter ABSNJZH (i.e. the absolute value of the net vertical
current helicity) for the HARP number 5011. The mean of X is shown by the horizontal line,
and the start times of two major ﬂares (M1.0 above) produced in this HARP by the vertical
red lines. Panel (b) shows the cumulative sum Y (black line) of X, and a set of local linear
trends ˜Y (red lines) for non-overlapping segments of equal length n = 120. The deviation of
Y from ˜Y is shown in Panel (c). Panel (d) shows a log-log plot of the detrended ﬂuctuation
˜F (i.e. the root-mean-square of (Y − ˜Y)) as a function of n. The DFA exponent α is deﬁned
as the slope of the least-squares straight-line ﬁt (red line) of the log-log plot. Panels (a–c)
adapted from Lee, Park, and Moon (2018).

Figure 3. Test of estimating α values from a set of (a) fBm and (b) fGn time series that
have diﬀerent values (i.e. 0–1 at intervals of 0.05) of H and three diﬀerent numbers (i.e. 0, 12,
and 32) of missing data points. For a given set of the H value and the number of missing data
points, the mean (ﬁlled circle) and standard deviation (error bar ) of estimated α values are
calculated from a set of 1,000 fBm and fGn time series, respectively.

for 118 ﬂare-quiet (blue bars) and 118 ﬂaring HARPs (red bars), respectively. In each panel,
the boundary between stationary and non-stationary time series (i.e. α = 1.0) is marked by
the vertical solid line and the boundary between anti-persistent and persistent property (i.e.
α = 1.5) by the vertical dashed line.
