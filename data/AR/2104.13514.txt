Fig. 1. Foveated graphics techniques rely on eccentricity-dependent models of human vision. While such models are well understood for spatial acuity (left,
[Geisler and Perry 1998]), our work is the first to experimentally derive a more comprehensive model for the spatio-temporal aspects over the retina under
conditions close to virtual reality applications. As seen in the three plots on the right, we model critical flicker fusion (CFF) thresholds in an eccentricity-
dependent manner. The CFF varies with spatial frequency 𝑓𝑠 and luminance and it exhibits an anti-foveated effect, with the highest thresholds observed in
the near–mid periphery of the visual field. Our perceptual model and its experimental validation could provide the foundation of future spatio-temporally
foveated graphics systems.

Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) displays strive to provide a resolution,
framerate and field of view that matches the perceptual capabilities of the
human visual system, all while constrained by limited compute budgets and
transmission bandwidths of wearable computing systems. Foveated graphics
techniques have emerged that could achieve these goals by exploiting the
falloff of spatial acuity in the periphery of the visual field. However, consid-
erably less attention has been given to temporal aspects of human vision,
which also vary across the retina. This is in part due to limitations of current
eccentricity-dependent models of the visual system. We introduce a new
model, experimentally measuring and computationally fitting eccentricity-
dependent critical flicker fusion thresholds jointly for both space and time.
In this way, our model is unique in enabling the prediction of temporal infor-
mation that is imperceptible for a certain spatial frequency, eccentricity, and
range of luminance levels. We validate our model with an image quality user
study, and use it to predict potential bandwidth savings 7× higher than those
afforded by current spatial-only foveated models. As such, this work forms
the enabling foundation for new temporally foveated graphics techniques.

INTRODUCTION

Emerging virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) systems have un-
locked new user experiences by offering unprecedented levels of
immersion. With the goal of showing digital content that is indistin-
guishable from the real world, VR/AR displays strive to match the
perceptual limits of human vision. That is, a resolution, framerate,
and field of view (FOV) that matches what the human eye can per-
ceive. However, the required bandwidths for graphics processing
units to render such high-resolution and high-framerate content in
interactive applications, for networked systems to stream, and for
displays and their interfaces to transmit and present this data is far
from achievable with current hardware or standards.

Foveated graphics techniques have emerged as one of the most
promising solutions to overcome these challenges. These approaches
use the fact that the acuity of human vision is eccentricity depen-
dent, i.e., acuity is highest in the fovea and drops quickly towards
the periphery of the visual field. In a VR/AR system, this can be ex-
ploited using gaze-contingent rendering, shading, compression, or
display (see Sec. 2). While all of these methods build on the insight
that acuity, or spatial resolution, varies across the retina, common
wisdom also suggests that so does temporal resolution. In fact it may
be anti-foveated in that it is higher in the periphery of the visual
field than in the fovea. This suggests that further bandwidth savings,
well beyond those offered by today’s foveated graphics approaches,
could be enabled by exploiting such perceptual limitations with
novel gaze-contingent hardware or software solutions. To the best

of our knowledge, however, no perceptual model for eccentricity-
dependent spatio-temporal aspects of human vision exists today,
hampering the progress of such foveated graphics techniques.

The primary goal of our work is to experimentally measure user
data and computationally fit models that adequately describe the
eccentricity-dependent spatio-temporal aspects of human vision.
Specifically, we design and conduct user studies with a custom, high-
speed VR display that allow us to measure data to model critical
flicker fusion (CFF) in a spatially-modulated manner. In this paper,
we operationally define CFF as a measure of spatio-temporal flicker
fusion thresholds. As such, and unlike current models of foveated
vision, our model is unique in predicting what temporal information
may be imperceptible for a certain eccentricity, spatial frequency,
and luminance.

Using our model, we predict potential bandwidth savings of fac-
tors up to 3,500× over unprocessed visual information and 7× over
existing foveated models that do not account for the temporal char-
acteristics of human vision.

Specifically we make the following contributions:

• We design and conduct user studies to measure and validate
eccentricity-dependent spatio-temporal flicker fusion thresh-
olds with a custom display.

• We fit several variants of an analytic model to these data
and also extrapolate the model beyond the space of our mea-
surements using data provided in the literature, including an
extension for varying luminance.

• We analyze bandwidth considerations and demonstrate that
our model may afford significant bandwidth savings for fove-
ated graphics.

Overview of Limitations. The primary goals of this work are to
develop a perceptual model and to demonstrate its potential benefits
to foveated graphics. However, we are not proposing new foveated
rendering algorithms or specific compression schemes that directly
use this model.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Perceptual Models

The human visual system (HVS) is limited in its ability to sense
variations in light intensity over space and time. Furthermore, these
abilities vary across the visual field. The drop in spatial sensitivity
with eccentricity has been well studied, attributed primarily to the
drop in retinal ganglion cell densities [Curcio and Allen 1990] but
also lens aberrations [Shen et al. 2010; Thibos et al. 1987]. This is
often described by the spatial contrast sensitivity function (sCSF),
defined as the inverse of the smallest contrast of sinusoidal grating
that can be detected at each spatial frequency [Robson 1993]. Spatial
resolution, or acuity, of the visual system is then defined as the
highest spatial frequency that can be seen, when contrast is at its
maximum value of 1 or the log of the sCSF is zero.

On the contrary, temporal sensitivity has been observed to peak in
the periphery, somewhere between 20 − 50◦ eccentricity [Hartmann
et al. 1979; Rovamo and Raninen 1984; Tyler 1987], attributed to
faster cone cell responses in the mid visual field by Sinha et al. [2017].

Table 1. Existing models of contrast sensitivity (CSF) and flicker fusion
(CFF). Note that CSF models perception continuously across a range of
conditions while CFF only models the limit of temporal perception at high
temporal frequencies. Unlike ours, none of these models accounts for spatial
and temporal variation as well as eccentricity and luminance.

Analogous to spatial sensitivity, temporal sensitivity is often de-
scribed by the temporal contrast sensitivity function (tCSF) and de-
tection at each temporal frequency. CFF thresholds then define the
temporal resolution of the visual system. While Davis et al. [2015]
recently showed that retinal image decomposition due to saccades in
specific viewing conditions can elicit a flicker sensation beyond this
limit, in our work we model only fixated sensitivities and highlight
that further modeling would be needed to incorporate gaze-related
effects (see Sec. 7).

While related, CFF and tCSF are used by vision scientists to quan-
tify slightly different aspects of human vision. The CFF is considered
to be a measure of conscious visual detection dependent on the tem-
poral resolution of visual neurons, since at the CFF threshold, an
identical flickering stimulus varies in percept from flickering to
stable [Carmel et al. 2006]. While contrast sensitivity is considered
to be more of a measure of visual discrimination, as evidenced by
the sinusoidal grating used in its measure requiring orientation
recognition [Pelli and Bex 2013].

Several studies measure datapoints for these functions indepen-
dently [de Lange Dzn 1958; Eisen-Enosh et al. 2017; Van Nes and
Bouman 1967], across eccentricity [Hartmann et al. 1979; Koen-
derink et al. 1978a], as a function of luminance [Koenderink et al.
1978b] and color [Davis et al. 2015], however few present quantita-
tive models, possibly due to sparse sampling of the measured data.
Additionally, data is often captured at luminances very different
from typical VR displays. The Ferry–Porter [Tyler and Hamer 1990]
and Granit–Harper [Rovamo and Raninen 1988] laws are exceptions
to this, describing CFF as increasing linearly with log retinal illu-
minance and log stimulus area, respectively. Subsequent work by
Tyler et al. [1993] showed that the Ferry-Porter law also extends to
higher eccentricities. Koenderink et al. [1978] also derived a complex
model for sCSF across eccentricity for arbitrary spatial patterns.

However, spatial and temporal sensitivity are not independent.
This relationship can be captured by varying both spatial and tem-
poral frequency to obtain the spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity
function (stCSF) [Robson 1966]. While Kelly [1979] was the first to
fit an analytical function to stCSF data, this was limited to the fovea
and a single luminance. Similarly, Watson et al. [2016] devised the
pyramid of visibility, a simplified model that can be used if only
higher frequencies are relevant. While also modeling luminance
dependence, this model was again not applicable to higher eccen-
tricities. Subsequent work saw the refitting of this model for higher

eccentricity data but the original equation was simplified to only
consider stationary content and the prediction of sCSF [Watson
2018].

To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no unified model
parameterized by all axes of interest, as illustrated in Table 1. With
this work, we address this gap, measuring and fitting the first model
that describes CFF in terms of spatial frequency, eccentricity and
luminance. In particular, we measure CFF rather than stCSF to be
more conservative in modeling the upper limit of human perception,
for use in foveated graphics applications.

2.2 Foveated Graphics

Foveated graphics encompasses a plethora of techniques that is en-
abled by eye tracking (see e.g. [Duchowski et al. 2004; Koulieris et al.
2019] for surveys on this topic). Knowing where the user fixates
allows for manipulation of the visual data to improve perceptual
realism [Krajancich et al. 2020; Mauderer et al. 2014; Padmanaban
et al. 2017], or save bandwidth [Albert et al. 2017; Arabadzhiyska
et al. 2017], by exploiting the drastically varying acuity of human
vision over the retina. The most prominent approach that does
the latter is perhaps foveated rendering, where images and videos
are rendered, transmitted, or displayed with spatially varying res-
olutions without affecting the perceived image quality [Friston
et al. 2019; Geisler and Perry 1998; Guenter et al. 2012; Kaplanyan
et al. 2019; Patney et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2017]. These methods pri-
marily exploit spatial aspects of eccentricity-dependent human vi-
sion, but Tursun et al. [2019] recently expanded this concept by
considering local luminance contrast across the retina, Xiao et
al. [2020] additionally consider temporal coherence, and Kim et
al. [2019] showed hardware-enabled solutions for foveated displays.
Related approaches also use gaze-contingent techniques to reduce
bit-depth [McCarthy et al. 2004] and shading or level-of-detail [Lue-
bke and Hallen 2001; Murphy and Duchowski 2001; Ohshima et al.
1996] in the periphery. All of these foveated graphics techniques pri-
marily aim at saving bandwidth of the graphics system by reducing
the number of vertices or fragments a graphics processing unit has
to sample, raytrace, shade, or transmit to the display. To the best
of our knowledge, none of these methods exploit the eccentricity-
dependent temporal characteristics of human vision, perhaps be-
cause no existing model of human perception accounts for these
in a principled manner (see Tab. 1). The goal of this paper is to
develop such a model for eccentricity-dependent spatio-temporal
flicker fusion that could enable significant bandwidth savings for
all of the aforementioned techniques well beyond those enabled by
existing eccentricity-dependent acuity models.

Many approaches in graphics, such as frame interpolation, tem-
poral upsampling [Chen et al. 2005; Denes et al. 2019; Didyk et al.
2010; Scherzer et al. 2012] and multi-frame rate rendering and dis-
play [Springer et al. 2007], do account for the limited temporal
resolution of human vision. However, spatial and temporal sensi-
tivities are not independent. Spatio-temporal video manipulation is
common in foveated compression (e.g., [Ho et al. 2005; Wang et al.
2003]) while other studies have investigated how trading one for
the other effects task performance, such as in first-person shoot-
ers [Claypool and Claypool 2007, 2009]. Denes et al. [2020] recently

studied spatio-temporal resolution tradeoffs with perceptual models
and applications to VR. However, none of these approaches rely
on eccentricity-dependent models of spatio-temporal vision, which
could further enhance their performance.

3 ESTIMATING FLICKER FUSION THRESHOLDS

To develop an eccentricity-dependent model of flicker fusion, we
need a display that is capable of showing stimuli at a high fram-
erate and over a wide FOV. In this section, we first describe a cus-
tom high-speed VR display that we built to support these require-
ments. We then proceed with a detailed discussion of the user study
we conducted and the resulting values for eccentricity and spatial
frequency–dependent CFF we estimated.

3.1 Display Prototype

Our prototype display is designed in a near-eye display form factor
to support a wide FOV. As shown in Figure 2(a), we removed the
back panel of a View-Master Deluxe VR Viewer and mounted a semi-
transparent optical diffuser (Edmund Optics #47-679) instead of a
display panel, which serves as a projection screen. This View-Master
was fixed to an SR Research headrest to allow users to comfortably
view stimuli for extended periods of time. To support a sufficiently
high framerate, we opted for a Digital Light Projector (DLP) unit
(Texas Instruments DLP3010EVM-LC Evaluation Board) that rear-
projects images onto the diffuser towards the viewer. A neutral
density (ND16) filter was placed in this light path to reduce the
brightness to an eye safe level, measured to be 380 cd/m2 at peak.
The DLP has a resolution of 1280 × 720, and a maximum frame
rate of 1.5 kHz for 1-bit video, 360 Hz for 8-bit monochromatic video,
or 120 Hz for 24-bit RGB video. We positioned the projector such
that the image matched the size of the conventional View-Master
display. Considering the magnification of the lenses, this display
provides a pixel pitch of 0.1’ (arc minutes) and a monocular FOV of
80◦ horizontally and 87◦ vertically.

To display stimuli for our user study, we used the graphical user
interface provided by Texas Instruments to program the DLP to the
360 Hz 8-bit grayscale mode, deemed sufficient for our measure-
ments of CFF, which unlike CSF, does not require precise contrast
tuning. The DLP was unable to support the inbuilt red, green and
blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) being on simultaneously, so we
chose to use a single LED to minimize the possibility of artifacts
from temporally multiplexing colors. Furthermore, since the HVS is
most sensitive to mid-range wavelengths, the green LED (OSRAM:
LE CG Q8WP) of peak wavelength 520 nm and a 100 nm full width
at half maximum, was chosen so as to most conservatively measure
the CFF thresholds. We used Python’s PsychoPy toolbox [Peirce
2007] and a custom shader to stream frames to the display by en-
coding them into the required 24-bit RGB format that is sent to the
DLP via HDMI.

Stimuli. The flicker fusion model we wish to acquire could be
parameterized by spatial frequency, rotation angle, eccentricity (i.e.,
distance from the fovea), direction from the fovea (i.e., temporal,
nasal, etc.) and other parameters. A naive approach may sample
across all of these dimensions, but due to the fact that each datapoint
needs to be recorded for multiple subjects and for many temporal

a user in our custom VR display prototype is shown on the left. An ND
filter is used to reduce the brightness of a DLP which projects onto a semi-
transparent diffuser. On the right we show an illustration of the last 3 orders

frequencies per subject to determine the respective CFFs, this seems
infeasible. Therefore, similar to several previous studies [Allen and
Hess 1992; Eisen-Enosh et al. 2017; Hartmann et al. 1979], we make
the following assumptions to make data acquisition tractable:

(1) The left and right eyes exhibit the same sensitivities and
monocular and binocular viewing conditions are equivalent.
Thus, we display the stimuli monocularly to the right eye by
blocking the left side of the display.

(2) Sensitivity is rotationally symmetric around the fovea, i.e.
independent of nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior direc-
tion, thus being only a function of absolute distance from the
fovea. It is therefore sufficient to measure stimuli only along
the temporal direction starting from the fovea.

(3) Sensitivity is orientation independent. Thus, the rotation an-

gle of the test pattern is not significant.

These assumptions allow us to reduce the sample space to only two
dimensions: eccentricity 𝑒 and spatial frequency 𝑓𝑠 . Later we also
analyze retinal illuminance 𝑙 as an additional factor.

Another fact to consider is that an eccentricity-dependent model
that varies with spatial frequency must adhere to the uncertainty
principle. That is, low spatial frequencies cannot be well localized
in eccentricity. For example, the lowest spatial frequency of 0 cpd
is a stimulus that is constant across the entire retina whereas very
high spatial frequencies can be well localized in eccentricity. This
behavior is appropriately modeled by wavelets. As such, we select
our stimuli to be a set of 2D Gabor wavelets. As a complex sinusoid
modulated by a Gaussian envelope, these wavelets are defined by
the form:

𝑔(x, x0, 𝜃, 𝜎, 𝑓𝑠 ) = exp

(cid:18) −∥x − x0 ∥2
2𝜎2

(cid:19)

cos (2𝜋 𝑓𝑠 x · [cos 𝜃, sin 𝜃 ]) ,

(1)

where x denotes the spatial location on the display, x0 is the cen-
ter of the wavelet, 𝜎 is the standard deviation of the Gaussian in
visual degrees, and 𝑓𝑠 and 𝜃 are the spatial frequency in cpd and
angular orientation in degrees for the sinusoidal grating function.

frequency (and radius) of stimuli. The number and eccentricity locations
per order were chosen based on radius to uniformly sample the available
eccentricity range. 𝑓𝑠 : spatial frequency, 𝜎: wavelet standard deviation, 𝑒:

We provide details of the conversion between pixels and eccentric-
ity 𝑒 in the Supplement. Of note however, is that we use a scaled
and shifted version of this form to be suitable for display, namely
0.5 + 0.5 𝑔(x, x0, 𝜃, 𝜎, 𝑓𝑠 ), such that the pattern modulates between
0 and 1, with an average gray level of 0.5. The resulting stimulus
exhibits three clearly visible peaks and smoothly blends into the uni-
form gray field which covers the entire field of view of our display
and ends sharply at its edge with a dark background.

This choice of Gabor wavelet was motivated by many previous
works in vision science, including the standard measurement pro-
cedure for the CSF [Pelli and Bex 2013] (see Sec. 2), and image
processing [Kamarainen et al. 2006; Weldon et al. 1996], where Ga-
bor functions are frequently used for their resemblance to neural
activations in human vision. For example, it has been shown that
2D Gabor functions are appropriate models of the transfer function
of simple cells in the visual cortex of mammalian brains and thus
mimicking the early layers of human visual perception [Daugman
1985; Marˆcelja 1980].

As a tradeoff between sampling the parameter space as densely as
possible while keeping our user studies to a reasonable length, we
converged on using 18 unique test stimuli, as listed in Table 2. We
sampled eccentricities ranging from 0◦ to almost 60◦, moving the
fixation point into the nasal direction with increasing eccentricity,
such that the target stimulus is affected as little as possible by the
lens distortion. We chose not to utilize the full 80◦ horizontal FOV
of our display due to lens distortion becoming too severe in the last
10◦. We chose to test 6 different spatial frequencies, with the highest
being limited to 2 cpd due to the lack of a commercial display with
both high enough spatial and temporal resolution. However it should
be noted that the acuity of human vision is considerably higher;
60 cpd based on peak cone density [Deering 1998] and 40–50 cpd
based on empirical data [Guenter et al. 2012; Robson and Graham
1981; Thibos et al. 1987]. The Gaussian windows limiting the extent
of the Gabor wavelets are scaled according to spatial frequency, i.e.,
𝜎 = 0.7/𝑓𝑠 such that each stimulus exhibits the same number of
periods, defining the 6 wavelet orders. Finally, eccentricity values
were chosen based on the radius of the wavelet order to uniformly
sample the available eccentricity range, as illustrated in Figure 2(b).

The wavelets were temporally modulated by sinusoidally varying
the contrast from [−1, 1] and added to the background gray level
of 0.5. In this way, at high temporal frequencies the Gabor wavelet
would appear to fade into the background. The control stimulus
was modulated at 180 Hz, which is far above the CFF observed for
all of the conditions.

3.2 User Study

Participants. Nine adults participated (age range 18–53, 4 female).
Due to the demanding nature of our psychophysical experiment,
only a few subjects were recruited, which is common for similar
low-level psychophysics (see e.g. Patney et al. [2016]). Furthermore,
previous work measuring the CFF of 103 subjects found a low vari-
ance [Romero-Gómez et al. 2007], suggesting sufficiency of a small
sample size. All subjects in this and the subsequent experiment had
normal or corrected-to-normal vision, no history of visual deficiency,
and no color blindness, but were not tested for peripheral-specific
abnormalities. All subjects gave informed consent. The research
protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the host
institution.

Procedure. To start the session, each subject was instructed to
position their chin on the headrest such that several concentric
circles centered on the right side of the display were minimally
distorted (due to the lenses). The threshold for each Gabor wavelet
was then estimated in a random order with a two-alternative forced-
choice (2AFC) adaptive staircase designed using QUEST [Watson
and Pelli 1983]. The orientation of each Gabor patch was chosen
randomly at the beginning of each staircase from 0◦, 45◦, 90◦ and
135◦. At each step, the subject was shown a small (1◦) white cross
for 1.5 s to indicate where they should fixate, followed by the test
and control stimuli in a random order, each for 1 s. For stimuli at 0◦
eccentricity, the fixation cross was removed after the initial display
so as not to interfere with the pattern. The screen was momentarily
blanked to a slightly darker gray level than the gray background
to indicate stimuli switching. The subject was then asked to use a
keyboard to indicate which of the two randomly ordered pattens
(1 or 2) exhibited more flicker. The ability to replay any trial was
also given via key press and the subjects were encouraged to take
breaks at their convenience. Each of the 18 stimuli were tested once
per user, taking approximately 90 minutes to complete.

Results. Mean CFF thresholds across subjects along with the stan-
dard error (vertical bars) and extent of the corresponding stimulus
(horizontal bars) are shown in Figure 3. The table of measured values
is available in the Supplemental Material.

The measured CFF values have a maximum above 90 Hz. This
relatively large magnitude can be explained by the Ferry–Porter
law [Tyler and Hamer 1990] and the high adaptation luminance of
our display. Similarly large values have previously been observed
in corresponding conditions [Tyler and Hamer 1993].

As expected, the CFF reaches its maximum for the lowest 𝑓𝑠
values. This trend follows the Granit–Harper law predicting a linear
increase of CFF with stimuli area [Hartmann et al. 1979].

For higher 𝑓𝑠 stimuli, we observe an increase of the CFF from the
fovea towards a peak between 10◦ and 30◦ of eccentricity. Similar

trends have been observed by Hartmann et al. [1979], including the
apparent shift of the peak position towards fovea with increasing
𝑓𝑠 and decreasing stimuli size.

Finally, our subjects had difficulty to detect flicker for the two
largest eccentricity levels for the maximum 𝑓𝑠 = 2 cpd. This is
predictable as acuity drops close to or below this value for such
extreme retinal displacements [Geisler and Perry 1998].

4 AN ECCENTRICITY-DEPENDENT PERCEPTUAL

MODEL FOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL FLICKER FUSION

The measured CFFs establish an envelope of spatio-temporal flicker
fusion thresholds at discretely sampled points within the resolution
afforded by our display prototype. Practical applications, however,
require these thresholds to be predicted continuously for arbitrary
spatial frequencies and eccentricities. To this end, we develop a
continuous eccentricity-dependent model for spatio-temporal flicker
fusion that is fitted to our data. Moreover, we extrapolate this model
to include spatial frequencies that are higher than those supported
by our display by incorporating existing visual acuity data and we
account for variable luminance adaptation levels by adapting the
Ferry–Porter law [Tyler and Hamer 1993].

4.1 Model Fitting

Each of our measured data points is parametrized by its spatial fre-
quency 𝑓𝑠 , eccentricity 𝑒, and CFF value averaged over all subjects.
Furthermore, it is associated with a localization uncertainty deter-
mined by the radius of its stimulus 𝑢. In our design, 𝑢 is a function
of 𝑓𝑠 and, for 13.5% peak contrast cut-off, we define 𝑢 = 2𝜎 where
𝜎 = 0.7/𝑓𝑠 to be the standard deviation of our Gabor patches.

We formulate our model as

Ψ(𝑒, 𝑓𝑠 ) = max(0, 𝑝0𝜏 (𝑓𝑠 )2 + 𝑝1𝜏 (𝑓𝑠 ) + 𝑝2

(2)

+ (𝑝3𝜏 (𝑓𝑠 )2 + 𝑝4𝜏 (𝑓𝑠 ) + 𝑝5) · 𝜁 (𝑓𝑠 )𝑒
+ (𝑝6𝜏 (𝑓𝑠 )2 + 𝑝7𝜏 (𝑓𝑠 ) + 𝑝8) · 𝜁 (𝑓𝑠 )𝑒2)

𝜁 (𝑓𝑠 ) = exp(𝑝9𝜏 (𝑓𝑠 )) − 1
𝜏 (𝑓𝑠 ) = max(log10

𝑓𝑠 − log10

𝑓𝑠0

, 0),

where p = [𝑝0, . . . , 𝑝9] ∈ R10 are the model parameters (see

We build on three domain-specific observations to find a contin-

uous CFF model Ψ(𝑒, 𝑓𝑠 ) : R2 → R that fits our measurements.

First, both our measurements and prior work indicate that the
peak CFF is located in periphery, typically between 20◦ and 50◦
of eccentricity [Hartmann et al. 1979; Rovamo and Raninen 1984;

Tyler 1987]. For both fovea and far periphery the CFF drops again
forming a convex shape which we model as a quadratic function of
𝑒.

Second, because the stimuli with very low 𝑓𝑠 are not spatially
localized, their CFF does not vary with 𝑒. Consequently, we enforce
the dependency on 𝑒 to converge to a constant function for any 𝑓𝑠
below 𝑓𝑠0 = 0.0055 cpd. This corresponds to half reciprocal of the full-
screen stimuli visual field coverage given our display dimensions.
Finally, following common practices in modeling the effect of
spatial frequencies on visual effects, such as contrast [Koenderink
et al. 1978c] or disparity sensitivities [Bradshaw and Rogers 1999],
we fit the model for logarithmic 𝑓𝑠 .

Before parameter optimization, we need to consider the effect of
eccentricity uncertainty. The subjects in our study detected flicker
regardless of its location within the stimuli extent m = [𝑒 ± 𝑢] deg.
Therefore, Ψ achieves its maximum within m and is upper-bounded

by our measured flicker frequency 𝑓𝑡 ∈ R. At the same time, nothing
can be claimed about the variation of Ψ within m and therefore, in
absence of further evidence, a conservative model has to assume
that Ψ is not lower than 𝑓𝑡 within m. These two considerations
delimit a piece-wise constant Ψ. In practice, based on previous work
[Hartmann et al. 1979; Tyler 1987] it is reasonable to assume that Ψ
follows a smooth trend over the retina and its value is lower than
𝑓𝑡 value at almost all eccentricities within m.

Consequently, in Table 3 we provide two different fits for the
parameters. Our conservative model strictly follows the restrictions
from the measurement and tends to overestimate the range of visible
flicker frequencies which prevents discarding potentially visible
signal. Alternatively, our relaxed model follows the smoothness
assumption and applies the measured values as upper bound.

To fit the parameters, we used the Adam solver in PyTorch ini-
tialized by the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm and we minimized

the mean-square prediction error over all extents m. The additional
constraints were implemented as soft linear penalties. To leverage
data points with immeasurable CFF values, we additionally force
Ψ(𝑒, 𝑓𝑠 ) = 0 at these points. This encodes imperceptibility of their
flicker at any temporal frequency.

Figure 3 shows that the fitted Ψ represents the expected effects
well. The eccentricity curves (row 2) flatten for low 𝑓𝑠 and their
peaks shift to lower 𝑒 for large 𝑓𝑠 . The conservative fit generally
yields larger CFF predictions though it does not strictly adhere to
the stimuli extents due to other constraints.

4.2 Extension for High Spatial Frequencies
Due to technical constraints, the highest 𝑓𝑠 measured was 2 cpd. At
the same time, the acuity of human vision has an upper limit of
60 cpd based on peak cone density [Deering 1998] and 40–50 cpd
based on empirical data [Guenter et al. 2012; Robson and Graham
1981; Thibos et al. 1987]. To minimize this gap and to generalize
our model to other display designs we extrapolate the CFF at higher
spatial frequencies using existing models of spatial acuity.

For this purpose, we utilize the acuity model of Geisler and

Perry [1998]. It predicts acuity limit 𝐴 for 𝑒 as

with parameters fitted to measurements of Robson and Graham [1981].
Their study of pattern detection rather than resolution is well aligned
with our own study design and conservative visual performance as-
sessment. Similarly, their bright adaptation luminance of 500 cd/m2
is also close to our display.

𝐴(𝑒) predicts limit of spatial perception. We reason that at this
absolute limit flicker is not detectable and, therefore, the CFF is not
defined. We represent this situation by zero CFF values in the same
way as for imperceptible stimuli in our study and force our model
to satisfy Ψ(𝑒, 𝐴(𝑒)) = 0.

In combination with our relaxed constraints we obtain our final
full model as shown in Figure 3. It follows the same trends as our
original model within the bounds of our measurement space and
intersects the zero plane at the projection of 𝐴(𝑒).

4.3 Adaptation luminance

Our experiments were conducted at half of our display peak lu-
minance 𝐿 = 380 cd/m2. This is relatively bright compared to the
50–200 cd/m2 luminance setting of common VR systems [Mehrfard
et al. 2019]. Consequently, our estimates of the CFF are conservative
because the Ferry–Porter law predicts the CFF to increase linearly
with logarithmic levels of retinal illuminance [Tyler and Hamer
1993]. While the linear relationship is known, the actual slope and
intercept varies with retinal eccentricity [Tyler and Hamer 1993].
For this reason, we measured selected points from our main experi-
ment for two other display luminance levels.

Four of the subjects from experiment 1 performed the same pro-
cedure for a subset of conditions with a display modified first with
one and then two additional ND8 filters yielding effective luminance
values of 23.9 and 3.0 cd/m2. We then applied a formula of Stan-
ley and Davies [1995] to compute the pupil diameter under these

where 𝑎 = 80 × 87 = 6960 deg2 is the adapting area of our display.
This allows us to derive corresponding retinal illuminance levels for
our experiments using 𝑙 (𝐿) = 𝜋𝑑 (𝐿)2/4 · 𝐿 as 67.3, 321 and 1488 Td
and obtain a linear transformation of our original model Ψ(𝑒, 𝑓𝑠 ) to
account for 𝐿 with an eccentricity-dependent slope as

ˆΨ(𝑒, 𝑓𝑠, 𝐿) = (𝑠 (𝑒, 𝑓𝑠 ) · (log10 (𝑙 (𝐿)/𝑙0)) + 1)Ψ(𝑒, 𝑓𝑠 )

(5)

𝑠 (𝑒, 𝑓𝑠 ) = 𝜁 (𝑓𝑠 )(𝑞0𝑒2 + 𝑞1𝑒) + 𝑞2

(6)
where 𝑙0 = 1488 Td is our reference retinal illuminance, 𝜁 (𝑓𝑠 )
encodes localization uncertainty for low 𝑓𝑠 as in Equation 3 and
q = [5.71 · 10−6, −1.78 · 10−4, 0.204] are parameters obtained by a
fit with our full model.

Figure 4 shows that this eccentricity-driven model of Ferry–Porter
luminance scaling models not only the slope variation over the retina
but also the sensitivity difference over range of 𝑓𝑠 well (degree-of-
freedom-adjusted R2 = 0.950).

5 EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION

Our eccentricity-dependent spatio-temporal model is unique in that
it allows us to predict what temporal information may be impercep-
tible for a certain eccentricity and spatial frequency. One possible
application for such a model is in the development of new perceptual
video quality assessment metrics (VQMs). Used to guide the devel-
opment of different video codecs, encoders, encoding settings, or
transmission variants, such metrics aim to predict subjective video
quality as experienced by users. While it is commonly known that
many existing metrics, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)
and structural similarity index metric (SSIM), do not capture many
eccentricity-dependent spatio-temporal aspects of human vision
well, in this section we discuss a user study we conducted which
shows that our model could help better differentiate perceivable and

fs = 0.57 cpde = 0 deg3.023.9190.03.023.9190.08

• Krajancich, et al.

non-perceivable spatio-temporal artifacts. Furthermore, we also use
the study to test the fit derived in the previous section, showing that
our model makes valid predictions for different users and points
beyond those measured in our first user study.

The study was conducted using our custom high-speed VR dis-
play with 18 participants, 13 of which did not participate in the
previous user study. Users were presented with videos, made up of
a single image frame perturbed by Gabor wavelet(s) such that when
modulated at a frequency above the CFF they become indistinguish-
able from the background image. Twenty-two unique videos were
tested, where the user was asked to rank the quality of the video
from 1 (“bad”) to 5 (“excellent”). We then calculate the difference
mean opinion score (DMOS) per stimulus, as described in detail
by Seshadrinathan et al [2010], and 3 VQMs, namely PSNR, SSIM
and one of the most influential metrics used today for traditional
contents: the Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) metric
developed by Netflix [Li et al. 2016]. The results of which are shown
in Figure 5. We acknowledge that neither of these metrics has been
designed to specifically capture the effects we measure. This often
results in uniform scores across the stimuli range (see e.g. Figure 5
III). We include them into our comparison to illustrate these limits
and the need for future research in this direction.

The last row shows a comparison of all measured DMOS values
with each of the standard VQMs and our own flicker quality predic-
tor. This is a simple binary metric that assigns videos outside of the
CFF volume where flicker is invisible a good label while it assigns
a bad label to others. Our full Ψ(𝑒, 𝑓𝑠 ) model was used for this pur-
pose. We computed Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficients (PLCC)
between DMOS and each of the metrics while taking into account
their semantics. Only our method exhibits statistically significant
correlation with the user scores (𝑟 (20) = 0.988, 𝑝 < 0.001 from a
two-tail t-test).

Further, we broke our stimuli into 5 groups to test the ability of

our model to predict more granular effects.

(1) Unseen stimulus. We select 𝑒 = 30◦ and 𝑓𝑠 = 1.00 cpd, a
configuration not used to fit the model, and show that users
rate the video to be of poorer quality (lower DMOS) when
it is modulated at a frequency lower than the predicted CFF
(see panel I in Fig. 5).

(2) 𝑓𝑠 dependence. We test whether our model captures spatio-
temporal dependence. Lowering 𝑓𝑠 with fixed radius makes
the flicker visible, despite not changing 𝑓𝑡 (panel II).

(3) 𝑒 change. By moving the fixation point towards the outer
edges of the screen, thereby increasing 𝑒, we show that our
model captures and predicts the higher temporal sensitivity
of the mid-periphery. Furthermore, by moving the fixation
point in both nasal and temporal directions, we validate the
assumed symmetry of the CFF. As a result, users were able to
notice flicker that was previously imperceptible in the fovea
(panel III).

(4) Direction independence. We confirm our assumption that sen-
sitivity is approximately rotationally symmetric around the
fovea. A single visible stimulus from Group 1 was also added
for the analysis as a control (panel IV).

Fig. 5. Results of our validation study. Each row represents one of the 5
tested effects along with a cumulative plot in the last row. Results of different
metrics (vertical columns) are compared to DMOS (right column). Each bar
represents the score for one stimulus rescaled so that a higher bar indicates
a better quality. PLCC of each metric and DMOS are shown along the p-
values (t-test). (*) and (**) mark statistical significance at 𝑝 = 0.05 and
𝑝 = 0.001 levels respectively.

(5) Mixed stimuli. We show that the model predictions hold up
even with concurrent viewing of several stimuli of different
sizes, eccentricities and spatial frequencies (panel V).

The perturbation applied to the videos in Groups 1–3 only varied
in modulation frequency or eccentricity with respect to a moving
gaze position. In response, the dependency of other metrics on 𝑓𝑡 is
on the level of noise, since changes related to variation of 𝑓𝑡 or 𝑓𝑠 of
a fixed-size wavelet average out over several frames, and moving the
gaze position does not change the frames at all. Our metric is able
to capture the perceptual effect, maintaining significant correlation
with DMOS (𝑟 (3) = 0.994, 𝑝 = 0.001, 𝑟 (2) = 0.983, 𝑝 < 0.05 and
𝑟 (3) = 0.977, 𝑝 < 0.001 respectively).

Groups 4 and 5 were designed to be accumulating sets of Ga-
bor wavelets, but all with parameters that our model predicts as
imperceptible. We observe that VQMs drop with increasing total
distortion area, while the DMOS scores stay relatively constant and
significantly correlated with our metric (𝑟 (2) = 1.000, 𝑝 < 0.001
and 𝑟 (3) = 0.993, 𝑝 < 0.01 respectively). These results indicate that
existing compression schemes may be able to utilize more degrees
of freedom to achieve higher compression, without seeing a drop
in the typical metrics used to track perceived visual quality. The
exact list of chosen parameters, along with the CFFs predicted by
our model are listed in the supplemental material.

In conclusion, the study shows that our metric predicts visibility
of temporal flicker for independently varying spatial frequencies and
retinal eccentricities. While existing image and video quality metrics
are important for predicting other visual artifacts, our method is a
novel addition in this space that significantly improves perceptual
validity of quality predictions for temporally varying content. In
this way, we also show that our model may enable existing compres-
sion schemes to utilize more degrees of freedom to achieve higher
compression, without compromising several conventional VQMs.

6 ANALYZING BANDWIDTH CONSIDERATIONS

Our eccentricity-dependent spatio-temporal CFF model defines the
gamut of visual signals perceivable to human vision. Hence any
signal outside of this gamut can be removed to save bandwidth
in computation or data transmission. In this section we provide a
theoretical analysis of the compression gain factors this model may
potentially enable for foveated graphics applications when used
to allocate resources such as bandwidth. In practice, developing
foveated rendering and compression algorithms holds other nuanced
challenges and thus the reported gains represent an upper bound.
To efficiently apply our model, a video signal should be described
by a decomposition into spatial frequencies, retinal eccentricities,
and temporal frequencies. We consider discrete wavelet decom-
positions (DWT) as a suitable candidate because these naturally
decompose a signal into eccentricity-localized spatio-temporal fre-
quency bands. Additionally, the multitude of filter scales in the
hierarchical decomposition closely resembles scale orders in our
study stimuli.

For the purpose of this thought experiment, we use a biorthogonal
Haar wavelet, which, for a signal of length 𝑁 , results in log2 (𝑁 )
hierarchical planes of recursively halving lengths. The total number
of resulting coefficients is the same as the input size. From there our
baseline is retaining the entire original set of coefficients yielding
compression gain of 1.

For traditional spatial-only foveation, we process each frame
independently and after a 2D DWT we remove coefficients outside
of the acuity limit. We compute eccentricity assuming gaze in the
center of the screen and reject coefficients for which Ψ(𝑒, 𝑓𝑠 ) =
0. From our model definition, such signals cannot be perceived
regardless of 𝑓𝑡 as they lie outside of the vision acuity gamut. The
resulting compression gain compared to the baseline can be seen
for various display configurations in Figure 6.

Next, for our model we follow the same procedure but we addi-
tionally decompose each coefficient of the spatial DWT using 1D
temporal DWT. This yields an additional set of temporal coefficients
𝑓𝑡 and we discard all values with Ψ(𝑒, 𝑓𝑠 ) < 𝑓𝑡 .

For this experiment, we assume a screen with the same peak
luminance of 380 cd/m2 as our display prototype and a pixel density
of 60 pixel per degree (peak 𝑓𝑠 = 30 cpd) for approximately retinal
display or a fifth of that for a display closer to existing VR systems.
The tested aspect ratio of 165:135 approximates the human binocular
visual field [Ruch and Fulton 1960]. We consider displays with a
maximum framerate of 100 Hz (peak reproducible 𝑓𝑡 = 50 Hz) and
200 Hz, capable of reaching the maximum CFF in our model. The

decomposition coefficients depending on the screen pixel density (left and
right plots) and the covered visual field (horizontal axis). Note the difference
in the gain axes scales.

conventional spatial-only foveation algorithm is not affected by this
choice.

Figure 6 shows that this significantly improves compression for
both small and large field-of-view displays regardless of pixel density.
This is because the spatial-only compression needs to retain all
temporal coefficients in order to prevent the worst-scenario flicker
at 𝑒 and 𝑓𝑠 with highest CFF. Therefore, it only discards signal
components in the horizontal 𝑒 × 𝑓𝑠 plane. On the other hand, our
scheme allows to also discard signal in the third temporal dimension
closely copying the shape of the Ψ which allows to reduce retained 𝑓𝑡
for both fovea and far periphery in particular for high 𝑓𝑠 coefficients
which require the largest bandwidth.

7 DISCUSSION

The experimental data we measure and the models we fit to them
further our understanding of human perception and lay the foun-
dation of future spatio-temporal foveated graphics techniques. Yet,
several important questions remain to be discussed.

Limitations and Future Work. First, our data and model work with
CFF, not the CSF. CFF models the temporal thresholds at which a
visual stimulus is predicted to become (in)visible. Unlike the CSF,
however, this binary value of visible/invisible does not model rel-
ative sensitivity. This makes it not straightforward to apply the
CFF directly as an error metric, for example to optimize foveated
rendering or compression algorithms. Obtaining an eccentricity-
dependent model for the spatio-temporal CSF is an important goal
for future work, yet it requires a dense sampling of the full three-
dimensional space spanned by eccentricity, spatial frequency, and
time with user studies. The CFF, on the other hand only requires us
to determine a single threshold for the two-dimensional space of
eccentricity and spatial frequency. Considering that obtaining all
18 sampling points in our 2D space for a single user already takes
about 90 minutes, motivates the development of a more scalable
approach to obtaining the required data in the future.

Although we validate the linear trends of luminance-dependent
behavior of the CFF predicted by the Ferry–Porter law, it would
be desirable to record more users for larger luminance ranges and
more densely spaced points in the 2D sampling space. Again, this
would require a significantly larger amount of user studies, which
seems outside the scope of this work. Similarly, we extrapolate our

10

• Krajancich, et al.

model for 𝑓𝑠 above the 2 cpd limit of our display. Future work may
utilize advancements in display technology or additional optics
to confirm the model extension. We also map the spatio-temporal
thresholds only for monocular viewing conditions. Some studies
have suggested that such visual constraint lowers the measured CFF
in comparison to binocular viewing [Ali and Amir 1991; Eisen-Enosh
et al. 2020]. Further work is required to confirm the significance of
such an effect in the context of displays.

It should also be noted that our model assumes a specific fixation
point. We did not account for the dynamics of ocular motion, which
may be interesting for future explorations. By simplifying temporal
perception to be equivalent to the temporal resolution of the visual
system we also do not account for effects caused by our pattern sen-
sitive system, such as our ability to detect spatio-temporal changes
like local movements or deformations. Similarly, we do not model
the effects of crowding in the periphery, which has been shown
to dominate spatial resolution in pattern recognition [Rosenholtz
2016]. Finally, all of our data is measured for the green color chan-
nel of our display and our model assumes rotational invariance as
well as orientation independence of the stimulus. A more nuanced
model that studies variations in these dimensions may be valuable
future work. All these considerations should be taken into account
when developing practical compression algorithms, which is a task
beyond the scope of this paper.

Finally, we validate that existing error metrics, such as PSNR,
SSIM, and VMAF, do not adequately model the temporal aspects
of human vision. The correlation between our CFF data and the
DMOS of human observers is significantly stronger, motivating error
metrics that better model these temporal aspects. Yet, we do not
develop such an error metric nor do we propose practical foveated
compression or rendering schemes that directly exploit our CFF
data. These investigations are directions of future research.

Conclusion. At the convergence of applied vision science, com-
puter graphics, and wearable computing systems design, foveated
graphics techniques will play an increasingly important role in
emerging augmented and virtual reality systems. With our work,
we hope to contribute a valuable foundation to this field that helps
spur follow-on work exploiting the particular characteristics of
human vision we model.
