Abstract

This paper focuses on the non-coherent detection in ambient backscatter communication, which

is highly appealing for systems where the trade-off between signaling overhead and the actual data

transmission is very critical. Modeling the time-selective fading channel as a ﬁrst-order autoregressive

(AR) process, we propose a new receiver architecture based on the direct averaging of the received signal

samples for detection, which departs signiﬁcantly from the energy averaging-based receivers considered

in the literature. For the proposed setup, we characterize the exact asymptotic bit error rate (BER) for

both single-antenna (SA) and multi-antenna (MA) receivers, and demonstrate the robustness of the new

architecture to timing errors. Our results demonstrate that while the direct-link (DL) interference from

the ambient power source leads to a BER ﬂoor in the SA receiver, the MA receiver can remove this

interference by estimating the angle of arrival (AoA) of the DL. The analysis further quantiﬁes the

effect of improved angular resolution on the BER as a function of the number of receive antennas. A

key intermediate result of our analysis is the derivation of a new concentration result for a general sum

sequence that is central to the derivation of the conditional distributions of the received signal.

vices within the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm [3]–[5]. Given the diverse nature of ap-

plications envisioned in the IoT ecosystem, the channel conditions experienced by the IoT

devices across different applications could vary signiﬁcantly [6]. In the context of this paper, the

channel coherence time experienced by these devices could vary by orders of magnitude across

applications. For instance, IoT devices deployed in high mobility scenarios, such as vehicles,

road signs, or trafﬁc posts, are expected to experience higher Doppler spread, and hence lower

channel coherence time, compared to the IoT devices deployed in relatively static scenarios,

such as homes, ofﬁces, and public places. While the latter case has implicitly been the focus of

most of the prior work on ambient backscatter communication systems, the former is equally,

if not more, important but has received much less attention. Most notably, lower coherence

time makes it difﬁcult to implement channel estimation and tracking procedure using either

training or blind estimation. Because of this, one needs to consider non-coherent detection

schemes for such scenarios, which have not yet been investigated in the context of ambient

backscatter communications. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper focuses on receiver

design and comprehensive performance characterization of non-coherent detection-based ambient

backscatter system under time-selective fading channels.

A. Related Work

As noted above, the existing literature on ambient backscatter is mainly focused on the slow

fading channels that assume a block fading model [7]–[23]. Maximum-likelihood (ML) detection

under an ambient backscatter setup was ﬁrst investigated in [8]. The signal detection under non-

coherent and semi-coherent setups is analyzed in [9]–[12]. The signal detection at a multiple

antenna receiver is studied in [13] and the statistical-covariance based detection is explored in

[14]. While [6]-[12] were based on the Gaussian distribution approximation for the conditional

distributions of the average energy of the received signal, the exact BER analysis for the slow

fading case was performed in [5]. Interested readers can also refer to [5] for a detailed overview of

the backscatter concept. Ambient backscatter communication using orthogonal frequency division

multiplexing (OFDM) is investigated in [15], [16]. On the same lines, [17], [18] explored new

coding schemes, such as Manchester coding, to improve detection performance. Some of the

existing literature that have worked on reducing the affect of the DL interference in ambient

backscatter are [15], [16], [24], [25]. In [24], a MA prototype is developed which overcomes the

affect of DL interference by estimating the channel using the preamble bits of Wi-Fi. In [15],

3

the repetitive pattern of the data in OFDM, due to the use of cyclic preﬁx, is exploited to cancel

the DL interference. Meanwhile, [16] has designed a non-coherent detector which totally avoids

the DL interference by utilizing the null sub-carriers in OFDM. In [25], an analog-digital hybrid

beamformer receiver, that designs the optimal beamforming vector using the AoA of the DL, is

proposed for a deterministic line-of-sight (LOS) channel. However, these works [15], [16], [24],

[25] consider a block fading channel and none of them have jointly investigated non-coherent

detection and time-selective fading which distinguishes our work.

A general requirement of coherent detection is the transmission of pilot/training symbols

from transmitter to receiver nodes for the estimation of channel state information (CSI). This

will require some form of cooperation between the primary and backscatter network nodes

which might not always be possible. Hence, alternate approaches that avoid the transmission

of pilots, such as blind channel estimation techniques, have also been investigated for ambient

backscatter [19]–[23]. These approaches use different techniques from Bayesian statistics such

as expectation-maximization (EM) or space alternating generalized expectation-maximization

(SAGE) to iteratively implement the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) or ML methods

to perform the channel estimation from the received signal directly. The performance of these

techniques depends on the accuracy and the convergence rate of the blind channel estimation

procedures. Therefore, if the convergence rate is slow, these techniques might not be suitable for

implementation in a time-selective fading channel. We overcome this drawback by investigating

a non-coherent detection technique that only requires estimating large-scale parameters.

B. Contributions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work that presents a comprehensive analytical

treatment of non-coherent detection in ambient backscatter under time-selective fading channels.

The time-selective fading channel is modeled using a ﬁrst-order AR process, and for this setup a

binary hypothesis testing problem is formulated to investigate the BER performance of the two

following receivers: 1) single-antenna (SA) receiver, and 2) multi-antenna (MA) receiver.

New Receiver Architecture: The receiver architecture used in the prior studies of ambient

backscatter requires the computation of the test statistic (TS) based on the average energy of

the received signal samples. In our work, we consider a different receiver architecture based on

the direct averaging of the received signal samples which requires lesser number of operations,

thereby reducing the complexity. Besides, it is more tractable compared to the conventional

4

architecture as derivations for the optimal detection strategies in that detector are not easy [7].

In addition, due to the exclusive linear operations in the new architecture, the receiver is shown

to be resilient to synchronization and timing errors. By deriving BER for the non-coherent setup,

we concretely demonstrate that while the new architecture is inadequate for an SA receiver, it has

good BER performance when used in conjunction with a MA receiver, which is attributed to the

elimination of the strong interference generated by the DL from the power source. The novelty

of the MA receiver designed here lies in its ability to exploit the fact that the time-scale over

which AoA varies is much larger than the time-scale over which the overall channel gain varies

and use it for tracking the AoA of the DL. As implied already, the new receiver architecture

also results in tractable conditional distributions, which facilitates the derivation of the optimal

detection strategy and the evaluation of the exact BER.

Asymptotic Growth Rate of a Generalized Sum Sequence: In the process of deriving condi-

tional distributions, we come across a sum sequence with correlation across samples. We inves-

tigate the asymptotic growth rate of this sum sequence and use it to derive a new concentration

result for another speciﬁc sequence of interest. This contribution is central to the evaluation of

the exact asymptotic conditional distributions and to the subsequent BER analysis.

Insights: Our analysis has shown that the SA receiver quickly reaches a BER ﬂoor due to

the strong interference resulting from the DL of the ambient power source. The performance

is shown to improve drastically after canceling this interference, which is achieved by tracking

the AoA of the DL using the MA receiver. Further, with multiple antennas it is possible to

achieve antenna gain, including an additional angular resolution when the the number of receive

antennas are increased beyond two. This improvement in angular resolution plays an important

role in applications where the AoAs of the DL and backscatter link (BL) are similar. The BER

with the new receiver architecture is shown to be independent of the signal sample-size of the

averaging operation for some cases, such as zero expected value of the ambient data sequence

and/or uncorrelated time-domain fading. For the more general case of correlated fading, the

BER is observed to improve with increasing time-domain correlation of the fading. Due to the

diminishing returns in the improvement of BER with increasing sample size, the BER initially

decreases and then reaches an asymptotic value. In addition, the ﬁrst-order AR process is shown

to be a good approximation of the reference models available for the time-selective fading

channels by comparing their BER performance under different scenarios.

A. System Setup and Channel Model

II. SYSTEM MODEL

The backscatter system in our current setup has three devices: ambient power source (PS),

backscatter transmitter (BTx), and receiver (Rx), as illustrated in Fig. 1. The channel considered

in the work is ﬂat Rayleigh faded whose coherence time is of the order of duration of each

ambient symbol, with spatial correlation at the Rx. The received signal contains two elements,

the DL coming from the ambient PS, and the backscatter link (BL) reﬂected from the BTx, with

their respective AoAs given by θ1 and θ2. Both the PS and BTx can be in motion, due to which

the channel gain of the three links (including the link from PS to BTx) will be changing with

time. As shown in [26], ambient backscatter can achieve communication with a far away receiver

like BS if the PS is not too far and the receiver can ﬁnd a way to separate the two links, which

is the primary motivation for the setup shown in Fig 1. Emerging applications that motivate the

selection of time-selective fading channel for ambient backscatter include smart fabrics where

tags/sensors are integrated into garments for monitoring vital signs [27], and sensors deployed

on the trafﬁc signs. The impulse response of the channel at Rx corresponding to the DL and

BL links in terms of the dominant NLOS path and the Rx antenna array response is given as

follows [28], [29]:

h(t) =

a(θ)δ (t − ¯τ ) ,

(1)

(cid:123)(cid:122)
h0(t)

(cid:125)

where the dominant NLOS path can be assumed to be a combination of N independent and

non-resolvable sub-paths due to the presence of local scatterers around the transmitter. The nth

sub-path is characterized by the gain cn, the phase offset φn, the time delay τn, the maximum

Doppler spread (DS) fd, and the angle of departure (AoD) ψn at the transmitter, as given in

the equation, δ represents the delta function, and ¯τ is the mean of the individual delays τn of

the sub-paths. The remaining parameters a(.) and θ are the Rx antenna array response vector,

and AoA of the NLOS path, respectively. The phase offset φn of each sub-path is uniformly

distributed over [0, 2π), and the additional phase offset resulting from the path-delay τn can also

be shown to be uniformly distributed over [0, 2π) since the frequency of operation is very high

[30, Lemma 4]. Applying the central limit theorem (CLT) to the n independent sub-paths, the

magnitude of the variable h0(t) can be shown as Rayleigh distributed. This channel environment

is illustrated in Fig. 2. The channel described here is valid when one of the PS or BTx or

6

both are mobile, and the receiver is located above the rooftops (such as BS) resulting in spatial

correlation across the antennas. The channel of the PS-BTx link will be similar to h0(t) with

additional DS coming from the local scatterers around BTx.

The rate at which the coefﬁcient h0(t) varies is dependent on the maximum Doppler spread

fd and the angular spread ψn of the sub-paths at the mobile user. These parameters are large

enough in this case due to the movement of the user and the presence of local scatterers, resulting

in a fast variation of h0(t). On the other hand, the array response vector a(.) depends on the

AoA θ of the NLOS path. The time-scale over which this parameter θ evolves is several orders

of magnitude larger compared to the coherence time of h0(t), and hence can be tracked by the

system. Therefore, while the channel coefﬁcient at the receiver will be changing for each ambient

symbol, the angular variation corresponding to AoA of the received signal will not change at

the same rate and can be assumed to be constant for few symbol periods. The MA receiver

designed in this work will build on this point to improve the BER performance of the system.

More information on this property of the fading channels can be found in [31]–[33].

Remark 1. The assumption of spatially correlated channel at the Rx is typically valid for a BS

located above the rooftops as the angular spread is small in these scenarios. We assume this to

be valid for a backscatter device also by considering a single dominant NLOS path. Handling

the case of multiple angular paths at the Rx is left as a promising future work. Further, extension

of the non-coherent detection approach proposed in the current work to a frequency-selective

channel is another promising area for future investigation.

(2)

where J0(.) is the zero order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. This result obtained under the

assumption of uniformly distributed azimuthal AoD and unit sum energy of the sub-paths is

known as Clarke’s reference model [34]. Similarly, the ACF for the PS-BTx link is given by

J0(2πfdtd)J0(2πafdtd), where a is the ratio of the DS at BTx and PS. The Clarke’s model

cannot be exactly realized in practice, and therefore the Jake’s model based on sum of sinusoids

is used to generate channel samples that have characteristics similar to the reference model [34].

Autoregressive (AR) modeling of fading channels: Though Jakes’ sum of sinusoids approach

to model the temporal-fading process is widely used, it requires large number of sinusoids (and

thereby increased complexity) to match the Clarke’s reference model and is not mathematically

tractable. Hence, this approach is not always convenient to apply for procedures such as channel

modeling, estimation and equalization. Instead, AR models are used either to decrease the

complexity of generating accurate correlated samples of the time-domain fading process or for

the derivation of the equalization parameters [35]–[38]. Therefore, to simplify the analysis, the

time-selective fading channel in our work is modeled as an AR process. The correlation matching

(CM) criterion of the AR model imposes a condition that the ACF of the approximated process

matches the sampled ACF of the Jakes’ model. An AR process of order p is given by [35]:

h[n] =

p
(cid:88)

k=1

akh[n − k] + v[n],

(3)

where v[n] is a complex white Gaussian noise process with uncorrelated real and imaginary

components. In the case of Rayleigh fading, v[n] has zero mean. The parameters related to

the AR model are given by {a1, a2, ..., ak} and the variance of v[n] by σ2

p. The ACF of this
approximated process of order p matches exactly with the samples of the desired ACF upto

p taps. The accuracy of this modeling approach using AR process increases with higher order

approximations. However, as shown in [39], the ﬁrst order AR model obtained by setting p = 1

is a sufﬁciently accurate model which can be represented as [36]:

h[n] = ρ h[n − 1] +

(cid:112)

1 − ρ2 g[n],

(4)

where h[n] and h[n−1] are the channel gains in the current and previous time periods, g[n] is the

complex white Gaussian noise process with variance σ2

h, and ρ ∈ [0, 1) is the correlation between

the fading coefﬁcients of the consecutive symbols. Depending on the link, the correlation factor

ρ is given by either J0(2πfdTs) or J0(2πfdTs)J0(2πafdTs), where Ts is the symbol duration.

The value of ρ determines the rate at which the current channel coefﬁcient de-correlates across

8

time. The recursive relation in (4) can be written in the direct form as:
(cid:41)

(cid:40)n−1
(cid:88)

h[n] = ρn−1h[1] +

1 − ρ2

(cid:112)

ρn−k−1g[k]

.

(5)

Note that the modeling of the time-selective fading using the ﬁrst order AR process in the current

work is a good ﬁrst step, and can be extended to a higher order AR process in future studies.

k=1

Remark 2. The time-selective fading implicitly handles the extreme cases of independent fading

(ρ = 0) and highly correlated fading (lim ρ → 1−). However, the block fading obtained by

conﬁguring ρ = 1 requires a separate analysis, and will be handled separately in a future work.

B. Signal Model

In general, the signal scattered from the backscatter device to the receiver is given by [40]:

r = (A − Γ) s = As − Γs,

(6)

where r is the signal at the receiver, s is the signal backcattered at the device, A is the load-

independent complex coefﬁcient of the device, and Γ is the reﬂection coefﬁcient of backscatter

node at the boundary of the antenna and the circuit. The device modulates the signal by varying

the load impedance to change the parameter Γ that controls the reﬂected signal. The ﬁrst and

second terms in (6) correspond to the structural mode and antenna mode scattering components,

respectively. A binary modulation scheme can be implemented by choosing two different values

Γ0 and Γ1. As shown later, non-coherent detection will result in good error performance only

for the case of OOK modulation. It is possible to achieve this modulation for antennas with

|A| ≤ 1 by designing the appropriate load impedance using only passive components [41], [42].

Since the data rate of most IoT applications is rather small, it is reasonable to assume that the

data rate of backscatter is lower compared to that of the ambient symbols. Under this assumption,

a single variable is enough to represent the backscatter data for a signal sample set of size N .

The signal at the SA receiver is the summation of the direct and backscatter signals, which can

be mathematically represented as follows:

y[n] = hr[n]x[n]

where x[n] is the ambient symbol sequence in complex baseband, w[n] is the additive complex

Gaussian noise, hr[n], hb[n] and ht[n] are i.i.d. zero mean complex Gaussian channel coefﬁcients

with variance σ2

h, b is the backscatter data, α is related to the parameter Γ1 of the BTx node.
The channel coefﬁcients hr[n], hb[n] and ht[n] are modeled using the AR process of order 1,

each having a different correlation factor given by ρr, ρb, and ρt, respectively. Since non-coherent

detection does not require the CSI, the channel gains hr[n], hb[n] and ht[n] are unknown at the

Rx. The received signal at the MA receiver with antennas Mr ≥ 2 is given by:

The null and alternate hypotheses of the binary hypothesis testing problem are denoted as H0

and H1, respectively. The BTx modulates the backscatter data using the binary on-off keying

(OOK) modulation scheme. As is generally the case, the ambient symbol sequence x[n] is

assumed to be i.i.d., with unit energy on average. We also assume that the noise energy σ2

n, the
h, and the correlation factors ρr, ρb, and ρt are known at the receiver.
In fact, they can be perfectly estimated with a long observation interval under the assumption

average channel energy σ2

that they remain constant, which is true as they are large-scale parameters.

Test Statistic (TS): Due to the reasons outlined in contributions, the receiver architecture is

based on the TS of the mean of the received signal samples, unlike the conventional TS of the

average energy of the received signal samples. The new TS can be mathematically denoted as:

Z =

It should be noted that derivation of the optimal TS for the time-selective channel is still an

open problem. In fact, the optimality of the TS, although important in general, has not really

been the main focus of the receiver design for ambient backscatter systems. Some very recent

work on the optimal detection and the selection of testing variable for a non-coherent detector

under block fading channel can be found in [43], [44].

III. DETECTION AT A SINGLE ANTENNA RECEIVER

In this section, we initially derive the growth rate of the expectation and variance of the gener-

alized sum sequence of interest. This result is then used to evaluate the conditional distributions

of the signal of the two hypotheses, and ultimately the BER of the SA receiver.

A. Growth Rate of a Generalized Sum Sequence of Interest

Consider the general sum sequence SN = (cid:80)
n1,n2

ρ|n1−n2| x[n1]x∗[n2], where m ∈ {1, 2}, deﬁned

as the sum of non-i.i.d. RVs, which plays an important role in the signal detection procedure.
In particular, the asymptotic property of the sum sequence given by MN = SN

N is required to
derive the conditional distributions. For this setup, if we can show that the growth rate of both the

expectation and variance of SN is of the order of N (the number of samples), that is sufﬁcient to

conclude that the sequence MN converges to its mean value as the sample size tends to inﬁnity.

Using the Chebyshev inequality, it is possible to show that this will indeed be the case if the

higher order moments of the RV X representing the i.i.d. ambient data sequences x[n] are ﬁnite.

These conditions on the moments of x[n] might be stronger than necessary but are nevertheless

reasonable and assumed here to simplify the derivation. One of the second order moments of

the ambient sequences x[n] is the sample energy which is given by:

¯E = E (cid:2)|X|2(cid:3) =

1
N

N
(cid:88)

n=1

|x[n]|2.

(10)

The result capturing the growth rate of SN is provided in the following Lemma. Note that one has

to be careful in deriving these concentration results since the sum sequence SN is not composed

of i.i.d elements. Please see the proof of the following Lemma for more details.

Lemma 1. The expectation and variance of the sum sequence SN both grow asymptotically
of the order of N , i.e., E[SN ] = Θ(N ) and Var[SN ] = Θ(N ), where f (x) = Θ(g(x)) means

that f (x) is asymptotically bounded both from above and below by g(x). As a consequence, the
sequence MN concentrates around E[MN ] when N → ∞, where

The analysis related to Lemma 1 on the asymptotic growth rate of SN is discussed now by

sample size N are shown in Figs. 3a and 3b, where it can be observed that the mean values

remain constant while their variances decrease as the signal sample size increases.

B. Conditional Distributions of the Signal

The null and alternate hypotheses H0 and H1 correspond to the scenarios of the transmitted

backscatter data b ≡ 0 and b ≡ 1, respectively.

1) Null Hypothesis H0: For the AR process used in this paper to model the time-selective

fading, the channel gain evolves with time according to (4), which can be described as a weighted

average of the previous channel gain and a new variable. Due to this dependence of the current

channel gain on the previous gains, the received signal samples are correlated, and hence the

co-variances of the samples are non-zero in general. As a consequence, both the variances and

co-variances of the signal has to be evaluated to derive the variance of the the mean received

signal Z. We transform the expression for each received signal sample into a sum representation

of independent RVs. This will simplify the evaluation of both the variance of each signal sample

and the subsequent evaluation of the variance of Z. This can be represented as following:

y[n] = hr[n]x[n] + w[n] =

2) Alternate Hypothesis H1: The received signal for a sample n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ N , under

the alternate hypothesis H1 is given by:

where hr[n], hb[n] and ht[n] are the fading gains following the process deﬁned by (5). Unlike

the case of H0, further work is needed to derive the distribution for H1 since the conditional

distribution of each sample is not complex Gaussian anymore. However, we preserve the Gaus-

sian property of the samples by further conditioning on hb[n] and show that this conditional

distribution asymptotically matches the true distribution. Only the distribution corresponding

to yb[n] is needed to be derived and the sequence M b

The results are valid for all ρr, ρb and ρt ∈ [0, 1), and the special case of independent fading

analyzed in the conference version [2] can be obtained by conﬁguring ρr, ρb and ρt all to zero.

C. Bit Error Rate

From the conditional distribution analysis, we see that the PDFs of the two hypotheses have

same mean but different variances, which are compared to obtain the optimal detection threshold.

Remark 3. Clearly, the BER expressions under the new receiver architecture are independent
of N when the expectation E [X] of the ambient data sequence is zero and/or the time-domain

fading is uncorrelated (all the ρ’s equal 0). Furthermore, the asymptotic BER value, with respect

to the increasing SNR, reaches an error ﬂoor instead of converging to zero. This error ﬂoor is

numerically demonstrated later in Fig. 5a. This necessitates the need to develop better techniques

to decode data in a time-selective channel, which takes us to the next main contribution.

IV. DETECTION AT A MULTI-ANTENNA RECEIVER

A. Effective Signal and Antenna Gain

The main reason for the poor BER performance of the SA receiver is the presence of the DL

from the ambient PS, which only acts as an interference since it does not carry any backscatter

data. The signals impinging on the neighboring antenna elements are phase shifted versions of

the signal at the ﬁrst antenna in addition to the independent additive noise. Observe that the

phase offset of the BL is independent of the phase offset of the DL. The interference of the

DL can be canceled by reversing the DL phase offset at each antenna starting from the second

element, and subtracting the resultant signal with that at the ﬁrst antenna, as given below:

˜y[n] =

(21)

which means that the resultant noise after the DL cancellation is correlated. The vector detection

problem can be converted to scalar detection by appropriately designing the weight vector. The

effective scalar signal samples for the averaging operation can be obtained by the following steps:
1) Whiten the additive noise with the linear transformation ˆK
the ﬁrst step along the direction of the resultant antenna array response ˆK

, and 2) Project the output of

˜a. The combined

In addition the resultant sample yeﬀ[n] is a sufﬁcient statistic for the detection procedure that

follows. It can be further shown that this procedure also minimizes the mean square error for

the signal estimation, and is hence known as the linear minimum mean squared error estimation

(MMSE) [45]. The phase-offset components ejφ1 and ejφ2 of the two links can be estimated from

the received signal by formulating a parameter estimation problem. However, this is beyond the

scope of the current work, and hence they are assumed to be perfectly known at the receiver.

For notational simplicity, the antenna gain is represented as a single variable G without any

input arguments even though it is a function of the two phase offsets (and hence the AoAs).

Remark 4. The antenna gain of a dual-antenna Rx (Mr = 2) simpliﬁes to G = 2 sin2 (cid:0) φ2−φ1
which is zero when the AoAs of the DL and BL links are almost the same. On the other hand,

(cid:1),

2

15

the antenna gain G for a Rx with Mr > 2 equals (1 − 1
Mr

)(Mr − 2), which is non-zero even

when the two AoAs are almost the same. Hence, additional angular resolution is obtained with

Mr > 2, which is useful for the applications where the AoAs of the DL and BL links are similar.

B. Conditional Distributions of the Effective Signal and Bit Error Rate

Now, we derive the conditional distributions of the effective signal derived in (22), and then

use them to evaluate the average BER of the MA receiver.

It should be noted that the SA scenario is not exactly a special case of the MA scenario,

even though there are similarities in the non-coherent detection approach and the subsequent bit

error rate evaluation of the two receivers. Mainly, the additional operation of the DL interference

cancellation in the MA scenario results in an effective antenna array vector and correlated additive

noise, which necessitates the handling of the MA receiver separately from the SA receiver.

16

It should be noted that the asymptotic value of K when N → ∞ is non-zero. Hence, the BER

does not converge to 0.5 as N → ∞ even though the individual variances converge to zero.

Remark 5. In case of fast-fading, where the fading gains are independent across the ambient

symbols, the average BER is only dependent on the expected value of the energy of the ambient

symbol. This special case concurs with our analysis in [2]. Alternatively, if the mean value of

the ambient symbol is zero (which is the case for most of the modulation schemes), then again

the average BER is only dependent on the expected value of the energy. Lastly, it can be inferred

from the BER expression that the average BER is an increasing function of the correlation factor.

V. RECEIVER SYNCHRONIZATION AND PARAMETER ESTIMATION

A. Delay Parameters

In this section, we discuss receiver synchronization in ambient backscatter, which is an

important ingredient of the proposed system design. First, we brieﬂy mention the parameters

to be estimated, and then either provide an analysis of the impact of incorrect estimation of

the parameter on the detection performance or provide a procedure to estimate the parameter.

In general, the estimation of both the timing delay and the carrier phase offset is necessary

in a communication system. In our setup, however, carrier phase estimation is not required

since non-coherent detection is employed. As the symbol duration of the backscatter data is

larger than that of the ambient data, it is not required to perform symbol synchronization at the

backscatter device. Therefore, the symbol timing recovery at the receiver is our main concern.

The parameters Ta and N represent the duration of the ambient symbol and the sample window

size at the receiver, respectively, which are assumed to be known a priori. The duration of

the backscatter symbol Tb is related to the above two parameters as Tb = N Ta. Due to the

architecture adopted at the receiver, it needs to estimate the following parameters: (i) the timing

delay τ ∈ [0, Ta) of the ambient data to obtain signal samples correctly, and (ii) the sample

number k ∈ {0, 1, 2, · · · , N −1} to reset the counter of the signal sample window. The estimation

of the delay τ for time-selective fading channels is a well-studied topic, where correlation-based

techniques are widely used to solve the ML estimation problem [46]. However, before going

into those details, it would be worthwhile to investigate how signiﬁcant would be the impact

of incorrect estimation of the delay (given by ˆτ ) on the achievable BER. For the purpose of

exposition, we assume that the pulse shape of the ambient symbols is rectangular, and hence the

matched ﬁlter pulse is also rectangular. Due to the mismatch of the estimated delay, the discrete

17

samples obtained at the SA receiver after the matched ﬁltering can be represented as:
Ta − ∆τ

where ∆τ = τ − ˆτ ∈ [0, Ta) equals the difference of the actual and the estimated path delays.

For a window of samples, the average of the samples will simplify as follows:

(28)

From (28), it is clear that the impact of the timing recovery error on Z (and hence on the BER)

will be negligible. In fact, due to the linear averaging operation of the new architecture, the

receiver is robust to synchronization errors, and it does not require the estimation of delay τ .

For the other parameter of interest k, a procedure for estimation is provided. Suppose that

backscatter device sends a preamble sequence of alternating bits 1010 · · · 10 (of length Nb), and

the index k represents the delay reset of the counter corresponding to the window of signal

samples. It should be noted here that the alternating bit sequences are commonly used in

conventional networks for clock and frame synchronization, e.g., see [47]. The sample mean

corresponding to backscatter symbols of (cid:48)0(cid:48) and (cid:48)1(cid:48) taken with a delay l are denoted as Z l

Since, the received signal corresponding to symbol (cid:48)1(cid:48) has both the DL and BL links, VarSA

18

consecutive samples yk

0 [n + 1] corresponding to the preamble bit 0 at the SA receiver.

Taking cross-correlation of the two signals, the DL correlation factor ρr can be evaluated as:

Since this averaging operation over different antenna elements has independent noise terms, the

accuracy of the estimate improves with the increasing value of Mr. The root mean square error

(RMSE) of the DL AoA as a function of the SNR is shown in Fig. 4a. As expected, the RMSE

improves with the increasing SNR. The BER performance of the MA receiver over the RMSE

values of interest is plotted in Fig. 4b. Using a similar method for estimating the AoA of the

BL does not result in good RMSE performance, which is mainly attributed to the interference

from the DL. Hence, alternate techniques are necessary to accurately estimate the AoA of the

BL, and one potential method is to utilize the residual signal from the DL cancellation operation

for the AoA estimation. Due to space limitations, it was not possible to include it in this paper

and is hence left as a promising future work.

VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, the accuracy of our analysis is veriﬁed by comparing with Monte-Carlo

simulations. In addition, some useful system design insights are also provided. The reﬂection

coefﬁcient Γ1 is conﬁgured appropriately to set the parameter α that will result in a signal

attenuation of 1.1 dB, and the variance of the fading gain σ2

h is set to 1. The BER performance
of the two receivers related to the special cases of independent fading (ρ = 0) and/or ambient
sequence with zero expectation (E [X] = 0), are compared in Fig. 5a. We observe that with

increasing SNR, the BER saturates quickly for a SA receiver without any further improvement.

This behavior can be attributed to the dependence of a non-coherent detector on differences

hand, as shown in Fig. 5a, the MA receiver can drastically improve the BER by removing the

direct path from the ambient power source. In this case, BER decreases continuously without

reaching any error ﬂoor. When the interference from the DL is removed in the MA receiver, only

the variance of alternate hypothesis scales proportionally to the increasing SNR which ultimately

results in the improved BER. Further, the average BER under these two cases is independent of

the signal sample size N as shown in Fig. 5b. The effectiveness of the proposed DL cancellation

technique is veriﬁed by comparing the BER of MA and SA receivers with and without the DL

interference, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, performance of the SA receiver without DL is

better compared to the MA receiver with DL. This is expected because the BER of the MA

receiver is averaged over the joint distribution of AoAs θ1 and θ2, and the performance is limited

when the AoAs are similar.

The results for more general cases are discussed now. Unless speciﬁed explicitly for the

particular plot, the values of different correlation factors ρr, ρb, and ρt are all considered equal

and represented as ρ. The error ﬂoor in a SA receiver decreases with correlation factor ρ, as

shown in Fig. 6a, and it can be inferred that a SA receiver is insufﬁcient for non-coherent

detection as the error ﬂoor values are very close to 0.5, which corresponds to the BER of a

naive hit/miss receiver. From Fig. 6a, it can also be veriﬁed that the numerically obtained BER

ﬂoor values of the SA receiver match with the asymptotic BER analytically derived in (18). The

waterfall curve, as shown in Fig. 6b, validates our asymptotic BER analysis presented in (27)

for the MA receiver with unequal values for different correlation factors. The BER performance

with increasing SNR in a MA receiver for different values of the correlation factor ρ is presented

in Fig. 7a, where it can be seen that the BER improves with increasing ρ. Likewise, the BER

performance with increasing sample size N for varying ρ is shown in Fig. 7b, and interestingly

the BER increases and saturates quickly with increasing N . However, as expected, there is an

increasing mismatch between the simulated and theoretical results of BER at lower values of

N as the value of ρ is increased. This mismatch occurs due to the need of a larger sample-

size N for the averaging operation, so that the simulation and theoretical results converge with

increasing ρ. The BER improvement observed with increasing ρ and N can be attributed to

the increment in variance of the alternate hypothesis while the variance of the null hypothesis

remains constant. The antenna gain achieved with additional antennas is presented in Fig. 8a, that

shows around 8 dB gain with the doubling of antennas. The simulation result for the analysis in

Remark 4, corresponding to the additional angular resolution achievable with antennas beyond

two, is shown in Fig. 8b. For this comparison, one can assume the AoA θ1 of the DL to be

uniformly distributed between (−π, π], and the AoA θ2 of the BL to be uniformly distributed
with mean θ1 and width ∆θ = 10◦. The results of the plot demonstrate that while the BER of the

dual-antenna Rx is close to 0.5, an antenna gain of around 9 dB is achieved with the doubling

of antennas in this case. The comparison between AR and Jakes’ channel models discussed in

Sec. II-A is shown in Fig. 9a. Two scenarios are considered for comparison: 1) speed of PS

and BTx are both 150 kmph, and 2) speed of PS and BTx are both 5 kmph. The corresponding

values of the correlation factors for a signal of bandwidth 1.5 KHz turns out to be: 1) ρr = 0.74,

ρb = 0.74 and ρt = 0.55, and 2) ρr = 0.99, ρb = 0.99 and ρt = 0.99. The BER performance

of our proposed approach for the AR model is similar to that of the Jakes’ channel under these

two scenarios. We checked many other scenarios and noticed a close match in all of them. We

can therefore conclude that the simpliﬁed AR model approximates the actual complex time-

selective channel very closely, while endowing tractability to the analysis. The approximation

can be further improved by using a higher order AR process for modeling the time-selective

fading channel. Finally, as shown in Fig. 9b, the impact of timing recovery errors is shown to

be negligible, which corroborates our timing analysis in Section V.

VII. CONCLUSION

Ambient backscatter systems have mainly been studied for low mobility scenarios that are

modeled using a block fading channel. While the block fading model is sufﬁcient for stationary

environments like home and ofﬁce, a time-selective fading model is more suitable for non-

stationary environments, such as roads and campuses. Therefore, in this paper, we have inves-

tigated the performance of an ambient backscatter system by studying the design and BER of

a non-coherent detector under time-selective fading channels. To the best of our knowledge,

this is the ﬁrst work that has incorporated both non-coherent detection and time-selective fading

into the ambient backscatter setup. Unlike the conventional architecture, which is implemented

using the average of the energy of the received signal samples, a new receiver architecture based

on the direct average of the signal samples is proposed. The new architecture is simpler to

implement, robust to timing errors, and lends tractability to the asymptotic analysis. We have

shown in the analysis that a BER ﬂoor exists for the SA receiver due to the DL interference of the

ambient power source, thereby resulting in an unacceptable performance. The BER is drastically

improved using a MA receiver by tracking the AoA of the DL and using it to eliminate the

interference. Further, having more than two receive antennas allows additional angular resolution,

which can support applications where the AoAs of the DL and BL links are very close. Though

the BER in the time-selective fading improves with increasing signal sample-size, it saturates

to an asymptotic value. Additionally, the BER is observed to improve with increasing temporal-

correlation of the fading channel. By comparing the BER, the simple ﬁrst-order AR process is

shown to be an effective approximation of the Clarke’s reference model available for the time-

selective fading channel. A natural extension of this work is to implement an ambient backscatter

system that can function in a channel with multiple angular paths at the receiver.

where (c) follows from the piece-wise separation of different summations by permuting the
indices i1, i2, j1 and j2 of the ﬁrst term, and the expansion of the second term E [SN ].

The main objective here is to show that the variance also grows asymptotically of the order

of N . The complete derivation of the variance expression is conceptually simple but tedious

to present in a limited space. For this reason, we only provide a sketch of the proof, which is

sufﬁcient to understand the approach. Recall the assumption that the higher order moments of

the sequences x[n] upto the highest order present in (36) are ﬁnite. With this assumption, it is

sufﬁcient to prove that the coefﬁcient of each moment increases of the order of N . The coefﬁcient
of E [|X|4] is straightforward to obtain and is given by N . Using (34), it is again straightforward
to show that (cid:80)
i1(cid:54)=j1

ρ2|i1−j1| is a function N , and the summations (cid:80)
i1(cid:54)=i2

1)2 are respectively

1 and ((cid:80)

given by N 2 and N (N−1). Hence, the coefﬁcient of (E [|X|2])2 is proportional to N and increases
asymptotically of the order of N . Then, the coefﬁcients of E [X(X ∗)2] E [X] , E [(X)2X ∗] E [X ∗]
and |E [X 2]|2, given by either (cid:80)
i1(cid:54)=j1
N . Similarly, the summation (cid:80)

ρ|i1−j1|+|i1−j2| can be evaluated by piece-wise categorization

ρ2|i1−j1|, are already shown to be proportional to

ρ|i1−j1| or (cid:80)
i1(cid:54)=j1

i

into different subsets and be shown to grow of the order of N . In addition, the summations

i1(cid:54)=j1(cid:54)=j2

ρ|i2−j2| and (cid:80)
i,i1(cid:54)=i2

ρ|i1−i2| can both be shown to have the same factor for N 2, and hence

(cid:80)
i1(cid:54)=i2(cid:54)=j2
the coefﬁcients of |E [X 2]|2 , E [X 2] (E [X ∗])2 and (E [X 2])∗ (E [X])2 all increase at the order
of N . Finally, it can also be shown that (cid:80)
ρ|n1−n2|)2 are both

i1(cid:54)=j1(cid:54)=i2(cid:54)=j2
proportional to N (N − 1) with the same factor, which also means that |E [X]|4 grows of the

ρ|i1−j1|+|i2−j2| and ( (cid:80)
n1(cid:54)=n2

order of N . From this, we can conclude that Var [SN ] = Θ(N ). As a consequence, the variance
of MN = SN

N will be decreasing at the rate of 1/N asymptotically. This completes the proof.

B. Proof of Lemma 2

When conditioned on x[n], a sample of the received signal under H0, as given in (12), is a

complex Gaussian RV. As a result, the mean of the received samples can also be characterized as

26

a complex Gaussian, albeit the samples correlated with one another. Since the complex Gaussian

RV is completely deﬁned by its mean and variance, we are just required to derive them. First,

the conditional expectation and variance of an individual sample y[n] can be derived as:

C. Proof of Lemma 3

Observe that when conditioned on the ambient signal x[n], the three signal components of

the received signal under the alternate hypothesis H1: (i) direct signal from ambient source, (ii)

backscatter signal, and (iii) receiver noise, are independent of each other.

y[n] = hr[n]x[n] + αhb[n]ht[n]x[n]

(cid:124)

+w[n]

(38)

This means that the expectation and variance of the sum can be derived using just the

expectation and variance of each component. Since, we have already computed the expectation

and variance of the direct signal and the receiver noise combination (in Lemma 3 for H0), it is

now enough to compute the expectation and variance of the backscatter component yb[n].

To derive that, we further condition the signal on hb[n] since it will preserve and allow us

to use the additive property of the Gaussian RVs. The conditional expectation and variance of

an individual sample of the backscatter signal yb[n] and the conditional covariance of any two

distinct samples y[i] and y[j] can be evaluated as:

E [yb[n]] = E [αhb[n]ht[n]x[n]] = αhb[n]x[n]E [ht[n]] = 0,

Var [yb[n]] = Var [αhb[n]ht[n]x[n]] = |α|2|hb[n]x[n]|2Var [ht[n]] = |α|2σ2

The ﬁnal step is to obtain the variance of mean Z of the signal samples under H1 by adding

the individual variances in (37) and (40) respectively. This completes the proof.

D. Proof of Theorem 1

The optimal decision rule for the receiver is evaluated through the comparison of the condi-

tional PDFs of the null and alternate hypotheses H0 and H1 derived in Lemmas 2 and 3, which

is given by [2]:

The decision rule of the optimal detection is only dependent on |Z|2. The variable |Z|2 is an

exponential distributed RV, whose mean parameter equals the variance of the complex Gaussian.

Assuming that the prior probabilities of the two hypotheses are equal, the conditional BER can

be derived as:

E. Proof of Lemma 4

The antenna gain ˜a∗ ˆK−1

˜a of the receiver is dependent on the inverse of ˆK ˜W, for which closed-
form expression can be obtained. The matrix ˆK ˜W can be re-written as ˆK ˜W = IMr−1 + JMr−1,
where IMr−1 is an identity matrix and JMr−1 is an all-ones matrix whose rank will be one.
Therefore, JMr−1 can be simpliﬁed using singular value decomposition (SVD) as u1σ1vT
the unitary matrices are given by u1 = v1 = −1√
value σ1 = Mr − 1. Due to the symmetry, this can be re-written in the form JMr−1 = uuT ,
where u =

of the sum of a invertible matrix A and the outer product uvT is given by (cid:0)A + uvT (cid:1)−1 =

F. Proof of Lemma 5

The effective signal yeﬀ[n], given in (22), under H0 is a complex Gaussian RV with variance

σ2
n. Hence, the mean Z of the received samples under H0 is a complex Gaussian RV with
variance VarMA
N . On the other hand, yeﬀ[n] under H1 is the sum of a scaled version of the
backscatter signal yb[n] in Lemma 3 with the same receiver noise variance. Using the procedure

0 = σ2

n

similar to the ones in Lemmas 2 and 3, the mean Z of the received samples under H1 can also

be shown to follow a complex Gaussian distribution, the variance of which is given by

G. Proof of Theorem 2

By comparing the conditional PDFs of the two hypotheses given in (24), the optimal detection

threshold TMA can be obtained. The conditional BER, evaluated using a procedure similar to the

one used in the case of SA receiver, is a function of the phase-offsets of the DL and BL links,

and the average BER is obtained by marginalizing the conditional BER over the variables θ1

and θ2. The assumption here is that θ1 and θ2 are i.i.d. and uniformly distributed over (−π, π],

and the ﬁnal expression in the result can be obtained by marginalizing over this range of θ1 and

θ2. One can choose more complex distributions of AoAs to model different scenarios.
