ABSTRACT

The physical properties and its contribution to the onset of solar ﬂare are still unclear al-
though chromospheric brightening is considered a precursor phenomenon of ﬂare. Many studies
suggested that photospheric magnetic ﬁeld changes cause destabilization of large-scale coronal
structure. We aim to understand how a small photospheric change contributes to a ﬂare and
to reveal how the intermediary chromosphere behaves in the precursor phase. We analyzed the
precursor brightening of the X1.6 ﬂare on 2014 October 22 in the AR 12192 using the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) data. We
investigated a localized jet with the strong precursor brightening, and compared the intensity,
Doppler velocity, and line width in C II, Mg II k, Si IV lines by IRIS and He II, Fe XII, Fe XV
lines by Hinode/EIS. We also analyzed photospheric magnetic ﬁeld and chromospheric/coronal
structures using Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). We found a signiﬁcant blueshift (∼100 km s−1),
which is related to the strong precursor brightening over a characteristic magnetic ﬁeld struc-
ture, and the blueshift was observed at all the temperature. This might indicate that the ﬂow is
accelerated by Lorentz force. Moreover, the large-scale coronal loop that connects the foot-points
of the ﬂare ribbons was destabilized just after the precursor brightening with the blueshift. It
suggests that magnetic reconnection locally occurred in the lower chromosphere and it triggered
magnetic reconnection of the X1.6 ﬂare in the corona.

Introduction

Solar ﬂares (Carrington 1859) are the biggest
explosive phenomena in the solar system that re-
leases magnetic energy stored in the solar corona
mainly as thermal and kinetic energy of the
Flares are observed as sud-
coronal plasma.
den enhancement of emission in multiple wave-
length (Fletcher et al. 2011). The CSHKP model
(Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974;
Kopp & Pneuman 1976) proposed that magnetic
reconnection drives magnetic energy release in a
ﬂare. The model is widely accepted as the stan-
dard ﬂare model, and it can explain observable
features of ﬂare such as a cusp-shaped structure
in the corona (Tsuneta et al. 1992), a hard X-
ray source above the ﬂare loop-top (Masuda et
al. 1994), plasmoid ejection (Ohyama & Shibata
1998), reconnection inﬂow (Yokoyama et al. 2001;
Chen et al. 2004) and outﬂow (Imada et al. 2013).
However, there are remaining problems related to
such as energy storage process, triggering process,
elementary process of magnetic reconnection, and

focus on the triggering process of ﬂares.

Various models have been proposed for the trig-
gering process of ﬂares so far. The kink mode
destabilization model (Fan & Gibson 2003; T¨or¨ok
& Kliem 2005) in which the highly twisted ﬂux
rope erupts by helical kink instability have been
proposed as a theoretical ﬂare onset model. The
break-out model (Antiochos et al. 1999), in which
the ﬂux rope grows by magnetic reconnection and
it ejects from overlying magnetic ﬁeld by loss-of-
equilibrium or loss-of-stability, is also known as
a ﬂare onset model. According to these mod-
els, it is inferred that strong twist motion such
as a photospheric horizontal ﬂow to form ﬁeld
aligned electric current is observed. An emerging
magnetic ﬂux (Chen & Shibata 2000) and tether-
cutting magnetic reconnection (Moore et al. 2001)
are also proposed as an important precursor ac-
tivity. Moreover, a large number of studies have
been investigated many kinds of precursory activ-
ities precede to a ﬂare such as evolution of the
coronal magnetic shear relating sunspot rotation
(Su et al. 2007; Vemareddy et al. 2012), converging
photospheric ﬂow lead tether-cutting ﬂux cancella-
tion (Sterling et al. 2010), ﬁlament destabilization
(Zuccarello et al. 2009), and coronal non-thermal

ﬂow relating photospheric helicity injection (Harra
et al. 2009). Therefore, over the last few decades,
considerable eﬀort has been devoted toward un-
derstanding the triggering process of ﬂares and
various ﬂare models have been proposed. How-
ever, it is still unclear what kind of “trigger(s)”
is dominant in the actual solar surface although
these models can explain a part of the physical
processes of ﬂares. Moreover, observational ver-
iﬁcation of these models is insuﬃcient, and the
model that can universally explain solar ﬂares is
still not established.

Precursor brightening seen in multiple wave-
length is widely considered as an important phe-
nomenon prior to a ﬂare. Tappin (1991) statis-
tically studied the relation between ﬂare occur-
rences and precursor brightening in soft and hard
X-rays, and they found that the vast majority of
X-ray ﬂares are preceded by soft X-ray precursors
some 10 to 60 minutes before the ﬂare. On the
other hand, F´arn´ık & Savy (1998) pointed out
that the physical properties of the ﬂare sites found
no consistent feature distinguishable from other
non-ﬂaring active region emission and hence no
deﬁnite evidence of a special precursor phase in
ﬂares. There are actually many brightening which
is not directly related to ﬂare triggering mecha-
nism as they suggested. In order to identify the
precursor brightening which can be an indicator
of a ﬂare, it is mandatory to simultaneously ana-
lyze photospheric magnetic ﬁeld data. Chifor et al.
(2007) and Joshi et al. (2011) analyzed ﬂares cor-
responding to ﬁlament eruptions using hard X-ray,
UV/EUV images, and magnetic ﬁeld data. They
found that X-ray precursors provide evidence for
localized magnetic reconnection which plays a cru-
cial role in destabilizing the active region ﬁlaments
leading to the ﬂares. Bamba et al. (2013) have
studied precursor brightening seen from two hours
to ﬁve minutes prior to the ﬂare onset in chromo-
spheric images. They found that chromospheric
precursor brightening is related to characteristic
magnetic ﬁeld structures that plays an impor-
tant role for ﬂare triggering. These magnetic ﬁeld
structures were quantitatively consistent with the-
oretical prediction by Kusano et al. (2012). How-
ever, the physical properties and its contribution
of precursor brightening to large-scale energy re-
lease in a ﬂare are still unclear. Therefore, it is
required to analyze the plasma dynamics in the

2

phase between precursor brightening and ﬂare on-
set in detail. The spectroscopic observations in
UV/EUV are useful to diagnose the plasma prop-
erty from chromosphere to corona. Although there
are several studies to diagnose the plasma during
the precursor to pre-ﬂare phase by spectroscopic
observation (e.g., Brosius & Phillips 2004; Imada
et al. 2014), most of them do not focus on the
plasma condition at the sight of precursor bright-
ening.

In this study, we aim to clarify the physical
properties and signiﬁcance of precursor brighten-
ing in a onset process of a sample event. We an-
alyzed the X1.6 ﬂare occurred in the great active
region (AR) NOAA 12192 on 2014 October 22.
The AR was the biggest sunspot region in the
solar cycle 24, and its magnetic structure was a
δ-type sunspot in which several umbra are shar-
ing penumbra. Generally δ-type region has high
possibility of a ﬂare, and actually more than 130
ﬂares, these are larger than C-class and includ-
ing six X-class ﬂares, occurred during its disk pas-
sage. The X1.6 ﬂare was the second X-class ﬂare in
the AR, and whole of the X1.6 ﬂare was observed
by both Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007), Solar Dy-
namics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. (2012)),
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS; De
Pontieu et al. (2014)) and Reuven Ramaty High-
Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin
et al. (2002)). Especially, the central region of the
ﬂare ribbons was well covered by IRIS and Hin-
ode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; Culhane et
al. (2007)). There are also magnetic ﬁeld data and
imaging data of the solar atmosphere by SDO. We
investigate the temporal evolution of the photo-
spheric magnetic ﬁeld structures and the chromo-
spheric/coronal responses in the precursor phase
of the X1.6 event, and discuss precursor activity
and onset scenario of the ﬂare.

This paper is organized as follows. The data
and analysis method are described in Sections 2
and 3, respectively. The results from SDO, Hin-
ode, and IRIS analysis are shown in Section 4. The
interpretation of the results and conceivable ﬂare
onset scenario of the X1.6 event are discussed in
Section 5. Finally, we summarize the result and
signiﬁcance of the study in Section 6.

2. Data Description

The AR NOAA 12192 appeared at the east limb
on 2014 October 16. It was the biggest sunspot re-
gion in the solar cycle 24, and it produced more
than 130 ﬂares that are larger than C1.0 class.
The X1.6 ﬂare, that is the second X-class ﬂare of
the six X-class ﬂares occurred in the AR, near the
disk center (S14◦, E13◦) on October 22. Figure 1
shows the soft X-ray light curve observed by the
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satel-
lite (GOES) 1-8 ˚A and 0.5-4 ˚A channels, and the
start, peak, and the end time of the X1.6 ﬂare are
14:02 UT, 14:28 UT, and 14:50 UT, respectively.
The C3.2 ﬂare occurred on 12:00 UT prior to the
X1.6 ﬂare at the same region. There was no ﬂaring
activities after the C3.2 ﬂare, as represented by the
ﬂat X-ray light curve in the period of 12:30-14:00
UT, but the X1.6 ﬂare suddenly happened. More-
over, there is no coronal mass ejection (CME) and
solar proton event (SPE) related to the X1.6 and
following C3.2 ﬂares 1.

We analyzed magnetograms and ﬁltergrams ob-
tained by SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Im-
ager (HMI; Schou et al. (2012)) and Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. (2012)).
We used HMI LOS/vector magnetograms in Fe I
line (6173 ˚A) to investigate photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld structures. Also, we used AIA ﬁltergrams
in 1600 ˚A (continuum and C IV line) and 131
˚A (Fe VIII, XXI), which are sensitive to emis-
sion from the transition region and upper chro-
mosphere, and the transition region and ﬂaring
corona, respectively (Lemen et al. 2012). The
cadence for LOS magnetograms, vector magne-
tograms, and AIA 1600 ˚A/131 ˚A images were
45 sec., 12 min., and 24 sec./12 sec., respec-
tively. We summarized observation parameters for
SDO/HMI and AIA in Table 1.

IRIS successfully scanned over the central re-
gion of the AR with the slit that is tilted to
45 degree from the solar NS direction, and took
spectra and slit-jaw images (SJIs). We used the
spectra and SJIs in the period of 10:00 UT (four
hours before the ﬂare onset) to 16:00 UT (two

LASCO CME catalog (https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_

hours after the ﬂare onset). The spectra were
obtained with coarse raster scan, and used C II
(1330 ˚A), Si IV (1400 ˚A), and Mg II k (2796 ˚A)
lines in this study. These were taken at eight po-
sitions of 0.33(cid:48)(cid:48) slit every 16.4 sec., i.e.
it took
approximately 2 min. to scan 8 steps (14(cid:48)(cid:48) × 174(cid:48)(cid:48)
FOV). The spectral resolution is 50 m˚A and 80
m˚A, and the pixel resolution is 0.33(cid:48)(cid:48) and 0.4(cid:48)(cid:48) for
far-ultraviolet (FUV; C II and Si IV) and near-
ultraviolet (NUV; Mg II k) images, respectively.
The SJIs were obtained in C II (1330 ˚A) and Mg II
k (2796 ˚A) lines every 32.7 sec. with a FOV of
167(cid:48)(cid:48) × 174(cid:48)(cid:48). The spatial resolution is 0.33(cid:48)(cid:48) and
0.4(cid:48)(cid:48) for C II and Mg II k images, respectively. We
summarized observation parameters in Table 2.

We also analyzed sparse raster scan data
obtained by Hinode/EIS from 13:01:56 UT to
15:56:56 UT on 2014 October 22. EIS observed
the AR with 12 spectral windows. In this study
we focused on three strong emission lines, Fe XII,
Fe XV, and He II, which are sensitive to the tem-
perature of log T = 6.2, 6.3, and 4.9, respectively.
The spectra were taken at 20 positions of 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slit
every 9 sec., and it took 3 min. to scan 20 steps
(i.e. 59(cid:48)(cid:48) × 152(cid:48)(cid:48) FOV). The spectral resolution is
22 m˚A as summarized in Table 2.

3. Analysis Methods

3.1. Analysis for the Imaging Data

We used the analysis method of Bamba et al.
(2013, 2014) to co-align HMI LOS magnetograms
and AIA images. Here, we brieﬂy review the
method. We used HMI level 1.5 LOS magne-
tograms (hmi.M 45s series) and AIA level 1.0 data
(aia.lev1 uv 24s and aia.lev1 euv 12s series)
from 10:00 UT to 17:00 UT on 2014 October 22.
We ﬁrst calibrated the HMI LOS magnetograms
and AIA images using the aia prep procedure in
Solar Soft Ware (SSW). Through this process, we
reduced the spatial ﬂuctuations, and rotated the
images so that the solar EW and NS axes are
aligned with the horizontal and vertical axes of
the image, respectively. Moreover, we resampled
LOS magnetograms and AIA images to the same
size because the pixel scales are diﬀerent between
HMI and AIA. Thus the positions of the LOS mag-
netograms and AIA images were aligned. Next,
we chose a LOS magnetogram and an AIA image
closest in time, and these two images were super-

imposed onto each other. Figure 2(a-c) shows the
LOS magnetograms on which the magnetic polar-
ity inversion lines (PILs; lines of 0G, green), and
the contour of the strong brightening in AIA 1600
˚A (red) are over plotted. AIA 131 ˚A images, on
which the PIL of HMI LOS magnetogram is par-
tially overlaid, are also shown in Figure 3.

We also investigated the distribution of the
relative shear angle χ over the AR before the
ﬂare onset, using the analysis method proposed
by Bamba et al. (in press). They developed the
method for Hinode/SP data, but here we applied
the method to HMI vector magnetogram, i.e. the
Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP:
hmi.sharp cea 720s series), because there were
no SP data before/after six hours from the on-
set time of the X1.6 ﬂare. The magnetic ﬁeld of
SHARP data series has been calibrated assuming
the Milne-Eddington atmosphere and remapped
to a Lambert Cylindrical Equal-Area projection,
and its 180◦ ambiguity in the horizontal compo-
nent is resolved using a minimum energy method
(Metcalf (1994); Leka et al. (2009, 2012)). There-
fore, we got the horizontal and radial component
of magnetic ﬁeld (Bx, By, Bz) from the SHARP
data. In this study, we used the SHARP vector
magnetogram taken at 13:35 UT on 2014 October
22, when is the closest in time to the last pre-
cursor brightening in AIA 1600 ˚A images over a
distinctive-shape PIL. We calculated the poten-
tial ﬁeld Bp using the fff procedure in the nlfff
package (developed by Dr. Yuhong Fan) in SSW.
Then we measured the angles between the poten-
tial ﬁeld vector Bp and the horizontal ﬁeld vector
2 in each pixel. In this paper,
Bh =
we call them “relative shear angle χ”. The rela-
tive shear angle χ is deﬁned between ±180◦, where
0◦ means vectors Bp and Bh are oriented in the
same direction. The direction of vector Bh devi-
ates from vector Bp to counter-clockwise (clock-
wise) when the magnetic helicity is positive (neg-
ative) and the value of χ is positive (negative).
We colorized the relative shear angles as shown in
Section 4.1 and Figure 2(d).

Bx

(cid:113)

With regards to IRIS data, we used level 2
data in which dark-current subtraction, ﬂat ﬁeld-
ing, and geometrical correction are taken into ac-
count. Because AIA 1600 ˚A images and HMI
LOS magnetograms are already co-aligned using

4

the above mentioned procedure, we can easily co-
align between HMI LOS magnetograms and IRIS
SJIs via AIA 1600 ˚A images. We drew the PILs
of HMI LOS magnetograms onto IRIS SJIs in or-
der to check the spatial and temporal correlation
between the precursor brightening and magnetic
ﬁeld (Figure 4(a, b)).

3.2. Analysis for the Spectrum Data

We calculated the Doppler velocities for Si IV
line, using IRIS coarse scan data.
First, we
performed wavelength calibration using a photo-
spheric line (S I, 1401 ˚A). We decided the cen-
tral value λSI obs of the observed wavelength for
S I line by the single Gaussian ﬁtting. Here, we
integrated the observed line proﬁle over the re-
gion, where was relatively quiet and out of the
sunspot umbra. We applied the single Gaussian
ﬁtting to the integrated line proﬁle and repeated
the process for the time period of 11:00 UT to
12:00 UT on October 22. We averaged the ﬁt-
ted line center value over the time period of 11:00
UT to 12:00 UT, and obtained the observed line
center λSI obs = 1401.5583 (˚A). Then we got dw
by subtracting λSI obs from λSI lab = 1401.5136
(˚A), which is the laboratory wavelength of S I line
(Kaufman & Martin 1993).

dw = λSI lab − λSI obs

Using dw, we calibrated Si IV line as

λ0,SiIV = λSiIV lab − dw ,

where λSiIV lab is the laboratory wavelength of
Si IV line (1402.769 ˚A; Brekke et al. (1997)), and
λ0,SiIV is the reference wavelength of Si IV in the
IRIS raster scan observation.

Next we identiﬁed the center of observed Si IV
line λSiIV obs using eis auto fit procedure in
SSW package, which apply the single Gaussian
ﬁtting to line proﬁles. Then we calculated the
Doppler velocities as

v =

∆λSiIV c
λ0,SiIV

,

where ∆λSiIV = λ0,SiIV − λSiIV obs and c is the
speed of light. We measured the Doppler velocities
from 10:00 UT to 16:00 UT on October 22, and
made maps of the Doppler velocities, intensities,

line width for Si IV line using eis get fitdata
procedure (as can be seen in Figure 4(c-f)). Using
the Si IV maps of Figure 4(c-f), we detected the
times and locations when/where the line proﬁles
were distinctive such as blueshifted or redshifted.
We displayed the spectrum images and line pro-
ﬁles of Si IV, C II, and Mg II k lines at the dis-
tinctive time and the location (Figures 5 and 6).
In these images and plots, the wavelength (˚A) was
converted to velocity (km s−1), and we deﬁned the
reference wavelength λ0,SiIV (1402.8 ˚A), λ0,CII
(1335.7 ˚A), and λ0,M gIIk (2796.4 ˚A) from Table 4
of De Pontieu et al. (2014) as 0 km s−1. The line
proﬁles in Figure 6 show the intensities of Si IV,
C II, and Mg II k lines at the time and location
when/where the signiﬁcant blueshift and redshift
are seen in Figure 4(c-f). Using these spectrum
images and line proﬁles, we discussed the Doppler
velocities for Si IV, C II, and Mg II k lines, with
order of approximately 10 km s−1 accuracy, in
Sections 4.2 and 5.

EIS data from the raster are processed using
the EIS team provided software (eis prep), which
corrects for the ﬂat ﬁeld, dark current, cosmic
rays, hot pixels, and slit tilt. For thermal reasons,
there is an orbital variation of the line position
causing an artiﬁcial Doppler shift of ±20 km s−1
which follows a sinusoidal behavior. This orbital
variation and wavelength calibration of the line
position were corrected using the house keeping
data (Kamio et al. 2010). We measured the av-
erage line centers of He II, Fe XII, and Fe XV lines
before the ﬂare (between 13:01-13:51 UT) for the
quieter region of the EIS FOV, in order to obtain
the reference wavelengths of 256.343 ˚A (He II),
195.121 ˚A (Fe XII), and 284.183 ˚A (Fe XV), re-
spectively. After above wavelength calibration,
we can determine the LOS velocities estimated by
Doppler shift in He II, Fe XII, and Fe XV emis-
sion lines with a few km s−1 uncertainty. Note
that the Doppler velocities in Figure 7 are derived
by applying the single Gaussian ﬁtting, while we
show line proﬁles with the double Gaussian ﬁtting
in Figure 8.

4.1. Overview of the Flare

Figure 2(a-c) shows the LOS magnetograms ob-
served by SDO/HMI. White/black indicates posi-

tive/negative polarity of LOS magnetic ﬁeld, and
green lines and the red contours outline the PILs
(0 G line of the LOS magnetic ﬁeld) and the strong
brightening in AIA 1600 ˚A images, respectively.
In panel (a), two isolated positive polarity regions
TR1 and TR2 are marked by the yellow circles,
and precursor brightening is seen over the south-
west PIL of both TR1 and TR2. TR1 locates
in the negative sunspot (NS) and it has emerged
from October 19. The precursor brightening is
seen over the southwest PIL, and it starts from
12:00 UT and strengthen around 13:40 UT on Oc-
tober 22. TR2 has also emerged as an isolated
positive polarity region from October 21, but it
gradually merged into the positive sunspot (PS).
Small brightening is intermittently seen over the
southwest PIL of TR2 from 10:00 UT, and it con-
tinues until 3 min. before the ﬂare start time. On
the other hand, the brightening in TR1 ﬁnishes
approximately 10 min earlier than the ﬂare start
time. The initial ﬂare ribbons appear as indicated
by the yellow arrows in panel (b), and these are
developed to typical two ﬂare ribbons which are
clearly seen in panel (c).

We also quantitatively investigated the distri-
bution of the relative shear angle χ, that is deﬁned
as the angles between the potential ﬁeld vector Bp
and horizontal ﬁeld vector Bh, using a HMI vector
magnetogram. Figure 2(d) shows the distribution
of χ at 13:35 UT, when the strong brightening is
seen over TR1. The red/blue corresponds to posi-
tive/negative values of χ, and the black lines indi-
cate the PILs (0 G line of the radial component Bz
of the magnetic ﬁeld). The angle χ is around −90◦
(blue) along the ﬂaring PIL while it is around 90◦
(red) at the southwest side of both TR1 and TR2.
Therefore, the distribution of the relative shear an-
gle χ suggests that the local magnetic shear in the
southwest side of both TR1 and TR2 towards the
opposite direction from the global magnetic shear
along the ﬂaring PIL between PS-NS.

Figure 3(b-f) shows the time series of AIA 131
˚A images. The small images in panel (c) are en-
larged view of the region where is surrounded the
red broken line in panel (b). In panels (g, h), we
plotted the total intensity (DN unit) in the region
where is surrounded by the red rectangle in panel
(b). The intensity enhancement around 12:00 UT
in panel (g) is corresponding to the C3.2 ﬂare. We
observed that the coronal loop connecting PS-NS

bright before the C3.2 event, although the inten-
sity become low and quiet after the C-ﬂare. Es-
pecially after 13:00 UT, i.e. from one hour before
the X-ﬂare, the coronal loop became dark as seen
in panel (b). A jet-like small eruption from TR1
to southwestward is observed at 13:35:00-13:36:00
UT (about 30 min. before the X-ﬂare onset), then
the strong precursor brightening is observed, as
indicated by the yellow arrows in panels (c, d).
Moreover, the coronal loop connecting PS-NS in
the region where is surrounded by the red square in
panel (b) become bright after the precursor bright-
ening (compare panels (b, d)). It is clearly seen
in panel (h) in which the baseline of the inten-
sity is enhanced after the precursor brightening in
TR1 that marked by the blue vertical line. Then
two ﬂare ribbons appear at the foot points of the
coronal loop connecting PS-NS (panel (f)).

4.2. Result from Spectroscopic Data

Figure 4(a, b) shows IRIS SJIs at 13:36 UT
(about 30 min. before the ﬂare onset). We over-
laid the PILs of HMI LOS magnetogram with
green line. The eight slit positions for spectro-
scopic observation are indicated by gray and blue
lines.
IRIS successfully scanned over TR1, and
we observed strong blueshift signals which are si-
multaneously seen with the last precursor bright-
ening in southwest of TR1. Figure 4(c-f) shows
the distributions of the intensity, Doppler veloc-
ity, and line width for Si IV line. The brighten-
ing in TR1, such as seen in Figure 2(a) is marked
by the yellow circle in each intensity image (left
columns). There is no signiﬁcant Doppler signal
and line broadening over TR1 although transient
brightening is seen in the region at 13:28:58 UT
(Figure 4(c)). However, signiﬁcant blueshift is ob-
served just after the last precursor brightening ap-
peared in the southwest region of TR1 at 13:35:31
UT, as seen in panel (d). The blueshift is weak-
ened in the brief period of 2 min. (panel (e)), and
further 7 min. later, redshift signal is observed in
the same region (panel (f)). The averaged veloc-
ity of the blueshift in panel (d) and the redshift in
panel (f) are ∼ −50 km s−1 and ∼ 25 km s−1 es-
timated by a single Gaussian ﬁtting, respectively.
Line broadenings are continuously observed dur-
ing the last precursor brightening is seen in panels
(d-f).

Figure 5 displays the spectral images of Si IV,

C II, and Mg II k lines. These spectra were taken
at a single slit spatial pixel in the fourth slit posi-
tion (indicated by the blue line in Figure 4(a, b))
and just over the region where the strong bright-
ening is seen at 13:35:31 UT in Figures 2(a), 3(c),
and 4(a, b). The spectra clearly shows blueshift as
indicated by the yellow arrows, and the locations
of the blueshift are consistent to the last precur-
sor brightening over TR1 around 13:36 UT. The
velocities are more than −50 km s−1 (almost up
to −100 km s−1) in each lines which represent
from the chromosphere to transition region tem-
perature plasma. The blueshift was observed in
all the three lines in Figure 5.

Figure 6 is the line proﬁles of the blueshift and
redshift taken at a single slit spatial pixel in the
fourth slit position. The solid lines are the proﬁles
at the point where the blueshift and redshift are
seen in TR1, at 13:36:36 UT in panels (a) and at
13:45:21 UT in panel (b). The horizontal axes are
converted from the wavelength (˚A) to the velocity
(km s−1), and the zero velocity is indicated by the
vertical broken lines. In panel (a), all the spectral
line proﬁles are clearly blueshifted. We can see
double intensity peak in the Si IV line proﬁle al-
though Si IV usually shows single intensity peak
proﬁle, and the velocity is almost −70 km s−1 at
that time at the point. C II and Mg II k lines usu-
ally have double intensity peak, and the reference
wavelength should be the center of the absorption
part in the middle of two emission part according
to our deﬁnition in Section 3.2. However, the cen-
ter of the absorption part is blueshift in C II line,
and the velocity is ∼ 40 km s−1 at that time at
the point.
In case of Mg II k line, it is diﬃcult
to determine the velocity because the line proﬁle
shapes much diﬀerent from that in a quiet region.
Nevertheless, it obviously has blueshifted compo-
nent. In panel (b), the signiﬁcant redshift can be
seen in Si IV and C II lines. Especially, Si IV
line proﬁle shows clear two intensity peak and the
velocity of redshifted part is almost 40 km s−1.
Mg II k line shows clear double intensity peak,
but Doppler shift is not signiﬁcant with the or-
der of velocity measurement (∼ 10 km s−1) in the
present study. Thus, the redshifts observed just
after precursory activity at all the temperature.

Figure 7 shows the similar plot to Figure 4(c-f):
the distributions of the intensity, Doppler velocity,
and line width for He II, Fe XII, and Fe XV lines

obtained by Hinode/EIS. The FOV covers the fol-
lowing negative sunspot region NS in Figure 2, and
the dark region in left bottom of each intensity
maps in Figure 7 corresponds to the sunspot um-
bra. There is no signiﬁcant brightening, Doppler
signal, and line broadening at 13:01:36 UT when
the AIA 131 ˚A intensity is constantly low as seen
in Figure 3(h). Conversely, we can clearly see
the strong brightenings, strong blueshifts, and sig-
niﬁcant line broadenings at 13:34:04 UT in Fig-
ure 7(d-f). These are corresponding to the last
precursor brightening, blueshift, and line broad-
ening seen in Figure 2(a), 3(c), and 4(d).

Figure 8 shows the line proﬁles of He II, Fe XII,
and Fe XV lines corresponding to the blueshift sig-
nals in Figure 7(d-f). The line proﬁles were aver-
aged over a period around 13:34:40 UT over the
region of the slit length in TR1. The vertical black
broken lines indicate the reference wavelengths.
The red lines show the double Gaussian ﬁtting re-
sults. The blueshifted components are almost up
to 100 km s−1 for He II and Fe XII, although the
line proﬁle in Fe XV shows much faster than the
others. There are Fe XVII (283.95 ˚A) and Al IX
(284.03 ˚A) in the spectral window. These blend-
ing lines might aﬀect the double Gaussian ﬁtting.
The redshifts are also seen at 13:44:47 UT in He II
and Fe XII lines of Figure 7(g, h), as well as seen
in Si IV line of Figure 4(f). The signiﬁcant line
broadenings are still remaining not only He II and
Fe XII lines but also Fe XV line, although there is
no signiﬁcant Doppler signal in Figure 7(i). The
ﬂare ribbon in the negative polarity region NS can
be seen at 14:06:13 UT in Figure 7(j-l). We can
clearly observe the typical temperature dependent
ﬂows which correspond to the chromospheric evap-
oration (Milligan & Dennis 2009; Imada et al.
2015). The detail analysis for the chromospheric
evaporation in this ﬂare has been done by Lee et
al. (in press).

4.3. Summary of the Results

1. Precursor brightening is observed in the
southwest region of the small isolated posi-
tive regions TR1 and TR2, which are located
between PS-NS. Especially, the last precur-
sor brightening near TR1 around 13:36 UT
is signiﬁcant, and a jet-like small eruption
from TR1 to the southwestward is approx-
imately simultaneously observed. After the

7

last precursor brightenning, the coronal loop
connecting PS-NS become brighter to the
ﬂare onset.

2. The southwest region of both TR1 and TR2
locally has the magnetic shear that towards
opposite direction to the global shear along
the ﬂaring PIL between PS-NS. In other
words, the magnetic helicity is locally posi-
tive in the southwest of both TR1 and TR2,
while the helicity along the ﬂaring PIL is
negative.

3. Strong blueshift (up to 100 km s−1) is de-
tected in the southwest region of TR1 simul-
taneously with the last precursor brighten-
ing around 13:36 UT. It is seen in all the lines
(in all the temparetures) that analyzed in
this study (Si IV, C II, and Mg II k lines ob-
tained by IRIS and He II, Fe XII, and Fe XV
lines obtained by Hinode/EIS).The redshift
is detected in the same location around 13:44
UT; later than the bluehisft in Si IV and C II
lines of IRIS.

5. Discussion

Here we discuss the triggering scenario of the
X1.6 ﬂare. As we summarized in Section 4.3, the
last precursor brightening and the small jet-like
eruption are observed corresponding to TR1, and
then the large-scale coronal loop connecting PS-
It suggests that a precursor
NS become bright.
activity, that is likely a small magnetic reconnec-
tion and corresponding jet, in TR1 makes global
structure in the corona unstable. TR1 is an op-
posite polarity emerging ﬂux that has been pro-
posed as a candidate of a “ﬂare-triggering struc-
ture” by some theoretical models (e.g. Heyvaerts
et al. (1977); Chen & Shibata (2000); Kusano et
al. (2012)).

The magnetic ﬁeld in TR1 has characteristic
structure. The magnetic shear locally reverses to
the global shear along the ﬂaring PIL as seen in
Figure 2(d). According to Kusano et al. (2012), a
small bipole ﬁeld can be a trigger of a ﬂare when
the magnetic shear in the bipole ﬁeld reverses to
the global magnetic shear.
It is so-called a Re-
versed Shear (RS) type ﬂare-trigger ﬁeld, and they
characterized the condition of the RS-type by two
parameters: the shear angle θ0 along the ﬂaring

PIL and the azimuth ϕe of the small bipole ﬁeld.
In this study, we deﬁned the relative shear angle
χ as the angle between the potential ﬁeld vector
Bp and horizontal ﬁeld vector Bh. The values
of χ along the ﬂaring PIL between PS-NS and χ
in the southwest region of TR1 correspond to the
shear angle θ0 and the azimuth ϕe, respectively.
Therefore, our results suggest that the TR1 is the
RS-type ﬂare-trigger ﬁeld of the X1.6 ﬂare.

Kusano et al. (2012) proposed that an RS-type
ﬁeld can trigger a ﬂare through the local cancel-
lation of magnetic shear of the AR through re-
connection with an RS-type of ﬁeld. Bamba et
al. (2013) have identiﬁed the ﬂare-trigger ﬁelds
including an RS-type structure for several ﬂare
events. They used precursor brightenings in the
chromosphere as a marker of the ﬂare-trigger ﬁeld.
Their analyses are based on the idea that the chro-
mospheric brightening is caused by preceding mag-
netic reconnection in the lower atmosphere be-
tween a trigger-ﬁeld and pre-existing sheared ﬁeld.
They call it “internal reconnection” in contrast
with “ﬂare reconnection” that occurs between the
pre-existing sheared ﬁelds and that is the main
source of the large energy release during a ﬂare.
However, it has been still unclear whether the “in-
ternal reconnection” is actually occurred in the
lower atmosphere such as in the chromosphere.

In this study, we found that all the lines ob-
served by IRIS and Hinode/EIS shows the inten-
sity enhancements, the strong blueshifts (upﬂows)
up to 100 km s−1, and the signiﬁcant line broad-
enings corresponding to the last precursor bright-
ening over the RS-type magnetic ﬁeld structure.
The lines are sensitive to emission from middle
chromosphere to the corona (log (T) ∼ 4.0 - 6.3).
All of these lines show the strong blueshifts up to
∼ 100 km s−1. The temperature dependence of
these blueshifts is weak. Generally, pressure gra-
dient driven ﬂows, such as chromospheric evapo-
ration (see Figure 7(j-l)), show the strong tem-
perature dependence (e.g. Fisher et al. (1985);
Watanabe et al. (2010); Imada et al.
(2015)).
Conversely, Lorentz force driven ﬂows, such as re-
connection ﬂow, may not show clear temperature
dependence. Thus, these results suggest that there
is an energy input such as magnetic reconnection
occurred in lower temperature region than middle
chromosphere in which Mg II k line is sensitive,
and that the jet launching chromospheric plasma

8

is observed as the blueshift signals around TR1.
Magnetic ﬁeld structure also supports the inter-
pretation that the internal reconnection occurred
in lower chromosphere. When we assume a half-
round loop, the loop top reaches around 2, 000 km
altitude because the size of the magnetic ﬁeld in
TR1 is almost 5(cid:48)(cid:48), and the internal reconnection
might occur from a few hundred to a few thou-
sand kilometer altitude.

Eventually, we propose the following ﬂare trig-
ger scenario of the X1.6 ﬂare as a picture that
is illustrated in Figure 9. First, internal recon-
nection occurred between the overlying sheared
magnetic loops (red loops) and small magnetic
loops (magenta loops) in TR1, where satisﬁes the
geometrical condition of the RS-type ﬂare trig-
ger region (see panel (a)). Precursor brightening
and blueshift in the chromosphere are observed
at that time (approximately 30 min. before the
ﬂare onset) as seen in Figure 2(a). Figure 9(b)
shows the picture of the internal reconnection over
TR1, that has similar three-dimensional geomet-
rical condition to the picture of Yokoyama & Shi-
bata (1995).Our results suggest that the internal
reconnection occurs at the foot point of the over-
lying sheared loops (red loops in panels (a)) in
the negative polarity region. Reconnection jets
(green arrows), which have the Alfv´en velocity,
may be created both side of the reconnection re-
gion (green diagonal line part). Then the chro-
mospheric plasma is launched upwards as illus-
trated by the blue arrow, and we observed it as the
blueshift with IRIS (Figures 4(d) and 6(a)) and
Hinode/EIS (Figures 7(d-f) and 8). After that,
the cool materials go down as illustrated by the
red arrow, but it might not intrude into the dense
and lower chromosphere (formation temperature
region of Mg II k line) because the speed is slower
than that of blueshift. Therefore, Mg II k line does
not signiﬁcantly redshifted in Figure 6(b). The in-
ternal reconnection between the red and blue loops
cancels magnetic shear over TR1, and it makes
small magnetic loops as illustrated by the sky blue
lines in panel (c). Then the overlying sheared
loops (red loops) collapse inward the region where
the magnetic pressure is decreased by shear cancel-
lation. Finally, ﬂare reconnection occurs between
the red loops and the dense and heated chromo-
spheric plasma evaporates and ﬁlls the connecting
loop (Yokoyama & Shibata 2001). The loop ﬁlled

9

by the heated plasma is observed as bright loops
in AIA 131 ˚A (Figure 3(e)). Then the initial ﬂare
ribbons appears at the four foot points of the red
loops and it enhances as Figure 2(b, c). Our sce-
nario is consistent with a possibility discussed in
Wallace et al. (2010), that reconnection between
a newly emerged ﬂux and pre-existing magnetic
loops before the ﬂare drives the ﬂows by a pressure
gradient between the newly reconnected loops.

Note that the contribution of the other RS-type
region TR2 is still unclear. In Figure 2(a), we also
can see a small brightening in the southwest re-
gion of TR2, where χ is around 90◦ (red-colored)
in Figure 2(d). However, the region is very small in
TR2 while that in TR1 is more clearly seen. More-
over, TR2 locates under the highly sheared mag-
netic loops along the ﬂaring PIL between PS-NS,
whereas TR1 is seemed to locates at almost NS-
side foot point of the magnetic loop. In Kusano
et al. (2012), they inject an RS-type bipole to just
above ﬂaring PIL, then TR2 is more consistent
location with their simulation setup. Bamba et
al. (in press) suggests that an RS-type ﬁeld could
work as a trigger of a ﬂare even if it locates slightly
away from the PIL as long as it locates under the
highly sheared magnetic loops. Therefore, it is
diﬃcult to identify which TR1 or TR2 is the trig-
ger or both could be a trigger of the X1.6 ﬂare.
In this paper, we have treated only the contribu-
tion of TR1 because both IRIS and Hinode/EIS
scanned over TR1.

6. Summary

In this study, we studied about the precur-
sor activity for the X1.6 ﬂare on 2014 October
22 in AR NOAA 12192. We analyzed the pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬁeld structure, the chromo-
spheric/coronal brightening, and the coronal loops
from SDO/AIA and HMI data. We also inves-
tigated the spectroscopic data of IRIS and Hin-
ode/EIS that are sensitive to emission from lower
chromosphere to the corona. As a result, we found
that the strong blueshift signals corresponding to
the last precursor brightening. The redshifts were
also observed just after the blueshifts were ob-
served. It suggests that the chromospheric plas-
mas were launched as a jet by magnetic reconnec-
tion in the lower chromosphere and fell down. The
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld structure also suggests

that the chromospheric jet was likely caused in the
triggering process of the X1.6 ﬂare. The magnetic
shear in the southwest region, where the precursor
brightening and chromospheric jet were observed,
locally towards the opposite direction to the global
magnetic shear along the ﬂaring PIL in the AR.
This feature is consistent with a small bipole ﬁeld
so-called the RS-type ﬁeld in Kusano et al. (2012)
that can trigger a ﬂare via magnetic shear cancel-
lation with the highly sheared ﬁeld in the AR.

In this study, we found a secondary ﬂow which
seems to be related to reconnection outﬂow rather
than chromospheric evaporation ﬂow. This is not
a direct evidence of internal magnetic reconnec-
tion between the RS-type ﬁeld and sheared ﬁeld
of the AR. Nevertheless this study is novelty in
the sense that it three-dimensionally investigated
the structural change from the photosphere to the
corona in the precursor phase, by using both imag-
ing and spectroscopic data. Our results show that
small photospheric magnetic ﬁeld structure aﬀects
large-scale topological change in the corona via lo-
cal magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere. It
can support the arguments of Kusano et al. (2012)
that a small magnetic disturbance appears in the
photosphere can trigger solar eruptive phenom-
ena such as a ﬂare. Bamba et al. (2013) tried
to examine the theoretical model by Kusano et al.
(2012) using observational data, and they found
small ﬂare triggering ﬁeld including an RS-type
ﬁeld. They treated precursor brightening seen in
chromospheric line such as Ca II H as a marker for
identiﬁcation of a ﬂare-trigger ﬁeld, based on the
viewpoint that the precursor brightening caused
by magnetic reconnection between a ﬂare-trigger
ﬁeld and sheared ﬁeld in the AR. In spite of that,
the physical connection between the photosphere
to the corona in a ﬂare trigger process was unclear.
Our ﬁndings in this study also supports the anal-
ysis method to identify the ﬂare trigger region in
Bamba et al. (2013). Moreover, in this study, we
showed the usefulness of combination observation
of imaging and spectroscopy of solar atmosphere
and photospheric magnetic ﬁeld observations. It is
expected that observational and theoretical stud-
ies give and take feedbacks each other and that we
reveal the details in the physical mechanism and
establish the comprehensive understanding of ﬂare
trigger.
