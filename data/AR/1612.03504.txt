ABSTRACT

Three homologous C-class ﬂares and one last M-class ﬂare were observed by both the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and
the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) in the AR 11429 on March 9, 2012. All the recurrent ﬂares occurred within a short
interval of time (less than 4 hours), showed very similar plasma morphology and were all conﬁned, until the last one when a large-
scale eruption occurred. The C-class ﬂares are characterized by the appearance, at approximatively the same locations, of two bright
and compact footpoint sources of ≈ 3–10 MK evaporating plasma, and a semi-circular ribbon. During all the ﬂares, the continuous
brightening of a spine-like hot plasma (≈ 10 MK) structure is also observed. Spectroscopic observations with Hinode/EIS are used to
measure and compare the blueshift velocities in the Fe XXIII emission line and the electron number density at the ﬂare footpoints for
each ﬂare. Similar velocities, of the order of 150–200 km s−1, are observed during the C2.0 and C4.7 conﬁned ﬂares, in agreement
with the values reported by other authors in the study of the last M1.8 class ﬂare. On the other hand, lower electron number densities
and temperatures tend to be observed in ﬂares with lower peak soft X-ray ﬂux. In order to investigate the homologous nature of the
ﬂares, we performed a Non-Linear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) extrapolation of the 3D magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in the corona. The
NLFFF extrapolation and the Quasi-Separatrix Layers (QSLs) provide the magnetic ﬁeld context which explains the location of the
kernels, spine-like and semi-circular brightenings observed in the (non-eruptive) ﬂares. Given the absence of a coronal null point, we
argue that the homologous ﬂares were all generated by the continuous recurrence of bald patch reconnection.

1. Introduction

Although major observational advances and signiﬁcant progress
in theoretical modelling have been achieved in the last few
decades, we still lack a deﬁnitive model for solar ﬂares. The stan-
dard model of ﬂares in 2D (CSHKP; Carmichael 1964; Sturrock
1968; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976) proposes that
ﬂares are driven by magnetic reconnection in the corona. The
energy release due to reconnection results in heating of the local
plasma, bulk kinetic energy and wave generation, although it is
still unclear how the energy is partitioned between diﬀerent pro-
cesses. In all cases, the energy is transported towards the chro-
mosphere at the ﬂare footpoints also called kernels, where the
plasma is heated to very high temperatures (above 10 MK), and,
due to the overpressure, evaporates along the ﬁeld lines (chro-
mospheric evaporation). The 2D model succeeds in explaining
the observed chromospheric brightenings and high temperature
upﬂows at the ﬂare footpoints, as well as particle acceleration
and the thermal cooling of loops. However, it fails to reproduce
some more detailed features which can only be explained by 3D
models of eruptive ﬂares, such as the strong-to-weak evolution
of the shear of ﬂare loops (Aulanier et al. 2012), the apparent
slipping motion of the ﬂare footpoints (Janvier et al. 2013; Dud´ık
et al. 2014, 2016) and the J-shaped structure of the ribbons (see,
e.g. Janvier et al. 2015, and references therein). Also, in the 3D

models, magnetic reconnection can happen even in the absence
of a null point: rather it is associated with ﬁnite-volume regions
where the magnetic connectivity is characterized by strong gra-
dients, called quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs; Priest & D´emoulin
1995; Demoulin et al. 1996; Titov et al. 2002). While there is
a general consensus on magnetic reconnection being the energy
release mechanism for ﬂares, the details of the energy conver-
sion and transport through the corona are still strongly debated.
Comparing the theoretical models with observations is compli-
cated by the fact that we cannot observe the energy release di-
rectly. A possible approach to this problem is to observe the
result of the heating, that is, plasma observables in EUV and
X-ray wavelengths (such as ﬂows, density, temperature, emis-
sion measure, electron distribution). Several authors have com-
pared observations with modelling in order to infer evidence
supporting a particular ﬂare model, between thermal conduc-
tion, thick-target or Afvenic wave models (see e.g. Petkaki et al.
2012; Doschek et al. 2015; Battaglia et al. 2015; Polito et al.
2016). One of the key observables is the blueshift of spectral
lines revealing upﬂows at the loop footpoints during the chro-
mospheric evaporation phase. This was ﬁrst observed in the soft
X-ray lines with SOLFLEX (Doschek et al. 1979) and the Solar
Maximum Mission (SMM) (Antonucci et al. 1982). These lines
(8–25 MK) showed strong blue-asymmetric proﬁles, in contrast
to the theoretical predictions of completely blueshifted line pro-

ﬁles (Emslie & Alexander 1987). The chromospheric evapora-
tion phase in ﬂares has subsequently been extensively observed
with the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS; Harrison et al.
1995) on board SoHO and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS;
Culhane et al. 2007) on board Hinode. Similar to the earlier stud-
ies, many CDS and EIS observations (e.g., Teriaca et al. 2003;
Brosius 2003; Milligan et al. 2006) still showed strong asym-
metries in the high temperature line proﬁles (Fe XIX with CDS,
Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV with EIS). These asymmetries were of-
ten interpreted as being due to a superposition of plasma up-
ﬂows at diﬀerent velocities along the line-of-sight (Warren &
Doschek 2005; Reeves et al. 2007). Totally shifted symmetri-
cal proﬁles were however sometimes observed (Del Zanna et al.
2006, 2011a; Brosius 2013), in agreement with theory. Our un-
derstanding of chromospheric evaporation has been consider-
ably improved since the launch of the IRIS satellite (De Pontieu
et al. 2014) in 2013. In particular, simultaneous joint observa-
tions with both EIS (in Fe XXIII) and IRIS (in Fe XXI) have
conﬁrmed that the asymmetric proﬁles seen with EIS are mostly
due to the limited spatial resolution of EIS, since IRIS observed
totally shifted Fe XXI proﬁles during all the observation(Polito
et al. 2016). On the other hand, compared to IRIS, EIS has
the advantage of observing many spectral lines formed at coro-
nal and ﬂare temperatures, which can provide useful plasma
diagnostics during ﬂares (see e.g. the observational review by
Milligan 2015). For instance, in the observation of a small B-
class ﬂare by Del Zanna et al. (2011a), the authors reported a
comprehensive study of chromospheric evaporation, cooling and
evolution of the plasma based on the analysis of several spectral
lines with EIS.

One of the unsolved questions in solar ﬂare models is un-
derstanding if the same mechanism is responsible for large and
small size events. Kahler (1982) suggested that there is a statisti-
cal correlation between solar ﬂare energy release and the magni-
tude of any measured ﬂare energy manifestation. Several statisti-
cal studies have been dedicated to comparing the plasma param-
eters of a large number of ﬂares over time (e.g. Feldman et al.
1996; Battaglia et al. 2005; Hannah et al. 2011). For instance,
Feldman et al. (1996) studied the correlation between soft X-ray
ﬂare class and emission measure with electron temperature for
868 ﬂares of X-ray class A2 to X2. They found that the logar-
itmic of the ﬂux measure in GOES 1–8 Å or 0.5–4 Å channels
and the EM measured by either detectors is linearly proportional
to the electron temperature.

It should be noted that ﬂare events happening in very dif-
ferent plasma environments are diﬃcult to compare directly. In
fact, each ﬂare can show diﬀerent plasma parameters because
of the diﬀerent initial conditions in the active region where it
occurred. The so-called recurrent or homologous ﬂares are par-
ticularly interesting events, where a similar magnetic ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration is reformed over time. Several authors have focused
on analysing the magnetic ﬁeld structure and evolution in recur-
rent ﬂares. Some of the studies suggest that the ﬂares are caused
by the continuous emergence of new magnetic ﬂux in the ac-
tive region (e.g Nitta & Hudson 2001). Other authors concluded
that persistent shearing motions could trigger the energy release
in homologous ﬂares (e.g. Romano et al. 2015). Although there
are several imaging and magnetic ﬁeld observations of recurrent
ﬂares, there have not been many spectroscopic observations to
date. One of the main issues is associated with the diﬃculty of
observing the exact location of the ﬂare footpoints for a long
period of time within the limited ﬁeld-of-view of spectroscopic
instruments.

A sequence of 4 recurrent ﬂares in the Active Region NOAA
11429 was observed by EIS on the 9 March 2012. EIS was
in a raster mode and could observe both ﬂare loop footpoints.
Spectroscopic observations of recurrent ﬂares in the same active
region (and covering both footpoint locations) oﬀer the unique
possibility of comparing the physical observables in ﬂares of dif-
ferent size taking place in a similar plasma environment. In par-
ticular, we aim to address the following questions:

– How do the plasma parameters (ﬂows, density, temperature)

vary in ﬂares of increasing energy?

– Is there a diﬀerence in the upﬂows observed at the two foot-

points during the chromospheric evaporation phase?

– How does the timing of the EIS observations (slit position
during the raster) aﬀect the measurement of the upﬂows dur-
ing the chromospheric evaporation process?

– What causes the homologous ﬂares and how does the mag-

netic ﬁeld structure evolve?

The ﬁrst three questions can be addressed by combining
multi-wavelength imaging from the SDO/Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA; Boerner et al. 2012) with spectroscopic ob-
servations from EIS. In order to study the magnetic ﬁeld struc-
ture during the recurrent ﬂares, we analysed data from the
SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al.
2012) and performed a Non Linear Force-Free Field (NLFFF)
extrapolation in the active region under study.

The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the
context of the AIA and EIS observations and the ﬂare events.
A detailed analysis of the blueshifts observed by EIS is then pre-
sented in Sect. 3. Sect. 4 and 5 provide density and temperature
diagnostics based on the use of spectroscopic and imaging data.
An analysis of the magnetic topology of the active region dur-
ing the recurrent ﬂares and the results of the extrapolation are
then presented in Sect. 6. Finally, we discuss and summarize our
results in Sect. 7.

recurrent ﬂares

Active Region (AR) NOAA 11429 was a highly complex βγδ
region which produced many energetic events during the inter-
val March 7–11, 2012. The magnetic evolution of this region
was analysed by several authors (e.g. Chintzoglou et al. 2015a;
Syntelis et al. 2016; Kouloumvakos et al. 2016; Patsourakos
et al. 2016a).

A sequence of ﬁve recurrent ﬂares occurred in the AR 11429
on March 9, 2012 from around 00:00 UT to 04:18 UT, as shown
in the GOES light curves in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst four C-class ﬂares
(C1.0, C2.0, C4.7 and C1.2) were all conﬁned. The last M-class
eruptive ﬂare started at 03:22 UT, reached a ﬁrst maximum in
the soft X-ray ﬂux at around 03:27 UT (M1.8 class) and, after

two small dips in intensity, increased up to about M6.3 (see Fig.
1). EIS observed three of the C-class ﬂares and the ﬁrst part of
the M-class ﬂare, as indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 1.

The M-class ﬂare is a well-studied event. A detailed anal-
ysis of the EIS observations of the M1.8 ﬂare was presented
by Doschek et al. (2013). This eruptive ﬂare was also studied
by Sim˜oes et al. (2013), who analysed the strong contracting
motions of peripheral coronal loops during the ﬂare impulsive
phase. In addition, Hao et al. (2012) focused on studying the
white-light emission produced during the ﬂare.

In this work we mainly focus on the series of three C-class
conﬁned ﬂares observed before the M-class ﬂare by EIS. The
vertical dotted lines in Fig. 1 indicate the times of the EIS rasters
which were analysed in this work. The start, peak, and end times
of all the ﬂares are summarized in Tab. 1.

Sect. 2.1 provides an overview of the homologous ﬂares
(including the last eruptive one), as observed in the SDO/AIA
multi-wavelength images. Sect. 2.2 presents the details of the
EIS spectroscopic observation of the three C-class conﬁned
ﬂares.

peak of the C4.7 class ﬂare. The intensity contours of the AIA
304 Å image of the ﬂare are overplot in red. The position of
the ﬂare footpoints K1 and K2 (see Sect. 3) are also indicated,
showing that the two footpoints are located in diﬀerent magnetic
polarities. The ﬁeld-of-view of the AIA images in Fig. 4 is over-
laid as a black boxed area.

2.1. AIA and HMI observation

The SDO/AIA and SDO/HMI magnetograms data were down-
loaded through the solarsoft VSO package and converted to level
1.5 images using the aia prep and hmi prep routines, respec-
tively. The images were also corrected for solar rotation and
aligned with the EIS images, as described in Sect. 2.2.

Fig. 2 shows an overview of the AIA observation of the
homologous ﬂares in the 304 (left), 171 (middle) and 131
(right) Å ﬁlters. During ﬂares, these ﬁlters are dominated by
emission from plasma at ≈ 0.05 MK, 1 MK and 11 MK respec-
tively (e.g. O’Dwyer et al. 2010; Del Zanna et al. 2011b). The
online Movies 1 and 2 show the evolution of the recurrent ﬂares

4

over time, as observed by the 171 Å and 131 Å ﬁlters respec-
tively.

The ﬁrst row of Fig. 2 shows the ﬁrst C1.0 class ﬂare just
after the peak, at around 00:38 UT. The ﬂare ribbons can best be
seen in the low temperature 304 Å image, while the 131 Å im-
age shows the high temperature ﬂare loops (≈ 10 MK). The
304 Å image also shows an elongated and dark ﬁlament struc-
ture following the polarity inversion line (PIL) along the whole
AR. Notice that the ﬁlament appears to be composed of several
segments which are constantly present until the major eruption
occurs during the M-class ﬂare. While the western arm has a sin-
gle U-structure, the eastern arm extends northward as a collec-
tion of smaller fragments. The observations —including those at
other wavelengths— do not allow us to discern if the fragmenta-
tion corresponds to an equally fragmented magnetic structure or
rather is the eﬀect of irregular absorption along the ﬁlament.

The second row in Fig. 2 shows the second C2.0 class ﬂare,
while the peak of the C4.7 class ﬂare (at around 02:00 UT) is
shown in the third row, with the ﬁeld-of-view of the EIS spec-
trometer overlaid (indicated by the coloured yellow and white
boxes). In order to better understand the context of the observed
event, the intensity contours of the 304 Å AIA image around
02:00 UT are overlaid on the the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld
(BLOS) map observed with SDO/HMI in Fig. 3. The overlay
shows the complex morphology of the ﬂare ribbons, with the
negative polarity ribbon having a semi-circular shape. We can
also observe two bright emission sources in the AIA 304 Å inten-
sity contours, which are located on opposite magnetic polarities
and indicated as K1 and K2 in Figs. 2 and 3. We indicate these
footpoint sources as kernels, since they represent the location
where the chromospheric evaporation takes place (in the context
of the 2D standard ﬂare model) as better described in Sects. 2.2
and 3. This interpretation is corroborated by the simultaneity of
the appearance of the two kernels in all 3 C-class ﬂares (Fig. 2
and online Movie 1), which indicates that the two locations are
magnetically connected by loops created during the ﬂare events.
Fig. 2 also shows the presence of a spine-like feature, which
is indicated by the white arrow in the 131 Å image at around
02:00 UT (third row). This feature is observed to brighten up
during all the recurrent ﬂares. A more detailed analysis of the
magnetic ﬁeld structure associated with these features will be
presented in Sect. 6.

The AIA images in the fourth row of Fig. 2 show the eruptive
M-class ﬂare just after its peak. In these images we note that the
ﬂare loops and the bright spine-like structure form at approxi-
mately the same location as the conﬁned ﬂares.

2.2. EIS observation

On the 9 March 2012, EIS was running a core ﬂare tr120x120
study from around 00:02:39 UT to 02:16:04 UT on the AR
11429, observing the sequence of the three C-class homolo-
gous ﬂares over a ﬁeld-of-view of 120(cid:48)(cid:48) × 120(cid:48)(cid:48). From around
the spectrometer then run an Atlas 30 full-
03:09:33 UT,
spectrum study and caught the last eruptive M1.8 class ﬂare. The
timing of core ﬂare tr120x120 and Atlas 30 observing studies is
indicated respectively by the ﬁrst and second (from left to right)
red arrows in Fig. 1. The Atlas 30 study was analysed in detail
by Doschek et al. (2013). In the following, we will focus on the
spectroscopic analysis of the ﬁrst three conﬁned ﬂares but also
compare our results with the diagnostics reported by Doschek
et al. (2013). The EIS core ﬂare tr120x120 study is a large raster
including 30 × 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slit positions with a jump of 1(cid:48)(cid:48) between each

position. The exposure time is around 4 s, resulting in a total
raster cadence of around 3 minutes. The study includes several
spectral windows, but in this work we only analyse the spectral
lines listed in Tab. 2. It is worth noting that the high temperature
Fe XXIV lines within the EIS spectral range are unfortunately
not included in this observation.

In order to understand the context of the spectroscopic ob-
servations, we ﬁrst align the EIS monochromatic intensity im-
ages with the AIA multi-wavelength images. This can be done
by comparing the AIA and EIS images which are formed at
similar temperatures and which therefore show plasma with the
same morphology. In particular, we compared AIA 304, 211,
335 and 131 Å images with EIS raster images formed in the He II

the AIA images in Fig. 4 is overlaid on Fig. 3 as context. The EIS
intensity images were obtained by performing a Gaussian ﬁt at
each pixel in the raster by using the c f it block solarsoft routine.
The ﬂare ribbons are best seen in the cool 304 Å (He II) emis-
sion in Fig. 4, while the 211 and 335 Å images (≈ 2 and 3 MK)
show that the two compact sources K1 and K2 and the spine-
like feature noted in Sect. 2.1 are also visible in the EIS intensity

formed between these sources, as shown in the 131 Å panel of
Fig. 4. This can also best be seen in Fig. 5, showing a zoom of the
EIS Fe XXIII image of the hot C4.7 ﬂare loop (LT indicates the
loop-top) with the Fe XVI intensity contours of the K1 and K2
footpoints overlaid. Sect. 3 describes in detail the evolution of
the high temperature (≈ 3–10 MK) blueshifts at the same com-
pact footpoint locations K1 and K2 for the sequence of the three
recurrent C-class ﬂares observed by EIS. We will only focus on
the C4.7 and C2.0 class ﬂares, as only weak Fe XXIII emission
and evaporation are observed for the smallest C1.0 class ﬂare.

3. Evolution of the blueshifts

In this section, we start discussing the observation of the C4.7
class ﬂare, where the Fe XXIII line during the evaporation phase
is strongest. The maximum upﬂows observed in the conﬁned
C4.7 and C2.0 class ﬂares are summarized in Tab. 3, which also
includes a comparison with the results of the analysis carried
out by Doschek et al. (2013) for the M1 class eruptive ﬂare. For
this last ﬂare, it is not possible to identify two clear footpoint
sources as multiple complex footpoint regions are observed by
the authors.

3.1. Accuracy of blueshift measurements

The measurements of the blueshifts require an accurate wave-
length calibration which is complicated by the lack of photo-
spheric reference lines in the EIS spectra. This is particularly
diﬃcult for the Fe XXIII 263.765 Å high temperature line, which
is not visible outside the ﬂare region. In order to obtain a refer-
ence wavelength for the Fe XXIII spectra, we measured the cen-
troid of the neighbouring Fe XVI 263.984 Å line in a background
quiet-Sun region, using a similar method to Polito et al. (2016).
The calibration procedure was then repeated for each EIS raster
analysed in this study, in order to account for the periodic shift of
the wavelength scale during the satellite orbital motion (Kamio
et al. 2010). The error associated with the wavelength calibration
is estimated to be within ≈ 5 km s−1 (e.g. Young et al. 2012). The
errors associated with the blueshift velocities in Tab. 3 are cal-
culated for each value as the quadratic sum of the error in the
centroid estimation from the Gaussian ﬁt and the error associ-
ated with the absolute wavelength calibration of the spectra, as
explained above. The values followed by an asterisk (∗) repre-
sent the velocity of the most blueshifted component when a dou-
ble Gaussian ﬁt was performed for asymmetric proﬁles. In this
case, it is not possible to associate a sensible error to the veloc-
ity value as the error from the ﬁt would be largely overestimated.
The choice of a double Gaussian proﬁle is in fact arbitrary since
the line proﬁle could potentially be ﬁtted as a combination of
several Gaussian components at diﬀerent blueshifted velocities.

However, there are no reason a priori to assume more than two
proﬁles and hence a double-Gaussian proﬁle represents the sim-
plest choice.

3.2. The C4.7 ﬂare

Fig. 6 shows a sequence of EIS monochromatic images as a
function of time (from left to right) during the impulsive and
peak phases of the C4.7 class ﬂare. The rasters are numbered
from 1 to 5 according to the order of the time intervals indi-
cated by the vertical dashed lines in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst, second and
fourth rows show intensity images formed in the Fe XIV (≈ 2
MK), Fe XVI (≈ 3 MK) and Fe XXIII (≈ 10 MK) lines respec-
tively.The last row shows intensity images formed in the blue
wing of the Fe XXIII line, obtained by integrating the line pro-
ﬁle over a wavelength interval corresponding to blueshifts from
about 60 km s−1 to 230 km s−1 ± 5 km s−1. These maps provide
the location of the bluemost component of the line and its evolu-
tion over time. Note that the colour scale may change for diﬀer-
ent rasters in order to show the early and faint hot temperature
emission of the Fe XXIII line. The third row shows the Doppler

shift velocity of the Fe XVI line, with the colour scale ranging
from -50 km s−1 (blue colour) to +50 km s−1 (red colour) for
all the rasters. The Fe XVI Doppler maps are calculated by tak-
ing the centroid position from the Gaussian ﬁt at each pixel. The
Fe XVI rest position has been measured for every EIS raster in
a background region, as explained in Sect. 3.1. The last column
on the right shows AIA images in the 211, 335 and 131 Å ﬁlters,
taken at the closest time to the EIS Raster 3 (middle column), at
around 02:00 UT.

The Fe XXIII emission is ﬁrst observed in the EIS Raster
2 (≈ 01:57 UT). This early emission is very faint, weakly
blueshifted (≈ 30 km s−1) and located mainly around the foot-
point K2 and on the spine-like structure. No emission at the foot-
point K1 is observed at this time.

In the Raster 3, the Fe XXIII emission is observed to have a
blueshift (≈ 100 km s−1), as shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Fig. 7 shows
the detector images (left) and corresponding spectra (right) of
the Fe XXIII spectral window at the footpoint K1 (top panels)
and K2 (bottom panels). The spectra have been obtained by av-
eraging over 2–3 EIS pixels along the slit direction. The de-
tector images show that the Fe XVI 262.98 Å line is observed

all along the EIS slit (as a foreground emission, see Del Zanna
et al. 2011a), while the Fe XXIII emission is only observed at
the ﬂare footpoints. Note that the detector images are saturated
in order to show the very faint Fe XXIII emission. The Fe XXIII
spectrum at K1 (top right panel) shows an asymmetric, but com-
pletely blueshifted, broadened and faint line proﬁle, with a cen-
troid position at around 106 km s−1. However, very weak more
blueshifted components might be also present. The Fe XXIII line
proﬁle at K2 (bottom right panel) is more intense and dominated
by a line component at rest, with a secondary weaker blue com-
ponent at around 100 km s−1.

A direct comparison between the line proﬁles at the two
footpoints can best be seen in the left panel of Fig. 8, show-
ing the Fe XXIII proﬁles in K1 (pink) and K2 (blue). The spec-
tra are ﬁtted by using the c f it solarsoft routine. The spectrum
in K1 was ﬁtted as a single, completely blueshifted Gaussian
component, while the asymmetric K2 proﬁle was ﬁtted by us-
ing two Gaussian components, which are indicated by the blue
dotted lines. The vertical black line represents the expected rest-
position of the Fe XXIII line, which has been determined as de-
scribed in Sect. 2.2. The double component proﬁle in K2 can
be interpreted as being due to the superposition of the evaporat-
ing plasma from the footpoint and the plasma which has already
ﬁlled the ﬂare loops. The right panel of Fig. 8 shows a Fe XXIII
spectrum at the top of the ﬂare loops (LT, shown in Fig. 5). The
line proﬁle at the loop top is at rest and symmetric, conﬁrm-
ing our interpretation of the double component proﬁle reported
above.

The spectroscopic analysis of the C4.7 class ﬂare suggests
that the magnitude of the evaporating ﬂows is around 100–150
km s−1 for both ﬂare footpoints. However, it is worth noting that
the slit is observing the ﬂare footpoints at diﬀerent times dur-
ing the EIS raster, and therefore we cannot rule out that higher
blueshift velocities were reached, as will be discussed in more
detail in Sect. 3.3. Finally, it is interesting to point out that the
Fe XVI line is observed to be almost completely blueshifted
and symmetric during the impulsive phase C4.7 class ﬂare, with
blueshift velocities up to around 40 km s−1.

particular, during the Rasters 4 and 5, the EIS images show a
strong Fe XXIII emission in the spine-like structure, conﬁrming
that this structure is dominated by high temperature ((cid:38) 11 MK)
plasma. During these rasters, we can also observe the ﬂare loops
which have cooled down and are now visible in the Fe XVI and
Fe XIV images, in agreement with the observations reported by
Del Zanna et al. (2011a). In addition to the kernels and the spine-
like structure, one can also note the presence of a fainter semi-
circular structure, which is clearly visible in the Fe XIV line (and
AIA 211 ﬁlter) in Figure 7.

After 02:10 UT, there is no detectable Fe XXIII emission in
the EIS ﬁeld-of-view (until the impulsive phase of the following
M1 class ﬂare).

3.3. The C2.0 ﬂare

Similarly to Fig. 6, Fig. 9 shows a sequence of EIS raster im-
ages for diﬀerent emission lines during the impulsive and grad-
ual phases of the C2.0 class ﬂare. The analogy of the global evo-
lution obtained comparing Figs. 6 and 9 conﬁrms the homolo-
gous nature of the ﬂares.

During the ﬁrst EIS raster (at around 01:23 UT), there is no
signiﬁcant Fe XXIII emission observed at the ﬂare footpoints.
From around 01:26 UT (Raster 2 in the ﬁgure), some faint
Fe XXIII emission is observed in both footpoints. The detector
images and corresponding Fe XXIII and Fe XVI spectra at these
locations are shown in Fig. 10 . The top panel shows that there is
a very faint high temperature Fe XXIII emission in the very early
impulsive phase at the footpoint K1. This emission is completely
blueshifted by around 200 km s−1, which is the highest velocity
recorded in this observation. In contrast, at the footpoint K2 (bot-
tom panel) the Fe XXIII proﬁle is blueshifted by only around 60
km s−1. The analysis of the C2.0 class ﬂare blueshifts seems to
therefore suggest that the Fe XXIII upﬂows at the footpoint K1
are larger than at the footpoint K2. However, it is important to
bear in mind that the diﬀerence between the upﬂows at the two
footpoints might also be related to the fact that the EIS slit is
rastering over these locations at diﬀerent times.

The Fe XXIII blueshifts at the footpoints then decrease in
the following rasters, going towards the peak of the ﬂare. In

In the following raster, the blueshift velocity decreases to
around 100 km s−1 at the K1 footpoint, while it remains at ≈ 60

km s−1 at the footpoint K2. There are then no signiﬁcant upﬂows
in the Fe XXIII line after about 01:30 UT and the Fe XXIII emis-
sion is not visible after ≈ 01:36 UT. The strongest blueshift in the
Fe XVI line is also observed at the footpoint K1, as shown in the
spectrum in Fig. 11. This is the only case we observed where
the Fe XVI line proﬁle shows a signiﬁcant asymmetry. The line
was ﬁtted with two Gaussian components (blue dotted lines), the
most blueshifted one showing an upﬂow velocity of ≈ 76 km s−1.
The semi-circular feature observed in the C4.7 ﬂare is also
clearly visible here, especially in the Fe XIV line. Such a struc-
ture, together with the spine-like brightening discussed above,
is suggestive of a circular ribbon ﬂare that is usually generated
by reconnection at a null point of the magnetic ﬁeld at coronal
heights, see e.g. Masson et al. (2009), Reid et al. (2012), Sun
et al. (2013) and references therein. However, the conﬁrmation
of the presence of such a topological feature and its role in the
homologous nature of the ﬂares studied requires more informa-

tion on the underlying magnetic ﬁeld (for further discussion see
Sect. 6).

From a comparison of the blueshifts in the two C-class ﬂares,
it seems that higher velocities are reached during the smaller
C2.0 class ﬂare. However, we emphasize that the timing of the
observations should also be taken into account. For the C4.7
class ﬂare, the area around the footpoint K1 was ﬁrst observed by
EIS at around 01:58 UT, that is ≈ 177 s after the beginning of the
ﬂare as measured by the GOES satellite (second column in Tab.
1). No signiﬁcant Fe XXIII is observed there at that time. During
the following raster, EIS observes a ≈ 145 km s−1 blueshift at
this footpoint at around 02:00 UT, that is already ≈ 300 s after
the beginning of the impulsive phase. For the C2.0 class ﬂare,
the highest blueshift of ≈ 200 km s−1 is observed at around 220 s
into the impulsive phase of the ﬂare. This suggests that larger up-
ﬂows at K1 might have been present during the impulsive phase

4. Electron number density from EIS observations

During ﬂares, the ratio of the Fe XIV 264.79 and 274.20 Å lines
observed by EIS provides useful electron number density di-
agnostics for the ≈ 2 MK plasma in the interval ≈ 109–1011
cm−3 (e.g. Del Zanna et al. 2011a; Brosius 2013; Polito et al.
2016). It is generally assumed that the Fe XIV line at 264.79 Å is
free from signiﬁcant blends in active region and ﬂare spec-
tra, as discussed by Del Zanna et al. (2006). In contrast, the
Fe XIV 274.20 Å is known to be blended with a Si VII line at
274.175 Å. The contribution of this latter spectral line can be
estimated by measuring the intensity of the other Si VII line ob-
served by EIS (at 275.35 Å), which forms a branching ratio with
the 274.175 Å Si VII line. The contribution of the Si VII to the
Fe XIV line around 274.2 Å however is usually estimated to be
very small, of the order of 4% (see e.g. Del Zanna et al. 2011a;
Brosius 2013). We note that Del Zanna et al. (2011a) obtained
Fe XIV densities from rest (foreground) and blue components
separately in their analysis of a B-class ﬂare. The rest compo-
nent densities were in agreement with the averaged AR densi-

10

ties, while the blueshifted component densities reached values
near the high-density limit (≈ 1011 cm−3). In this work, we do not
observe any clear asymmetry in the Fe XIV line proﬁles which
were thus ﬁtted as a single Gaussian component, as in Polito
et al. (2016). However, the Fe XIV lines at the footpoints are
observed to be broadened and hence we cannot rule out that dif-
ferent line components are present within the spectral resolution
of the instruments. Our estimates are therefore likely to represent
average density values.

We measured the ratio of

the Fe XIV 264.79 and
274.20 Å lines (after removing the Si VII contribution) from the
impulsive to the gradual phase for the three conﬁned ﬂares and
obtained the electron number density by using Fe XIV atomic
data from the CHIANTI v8 database. Fig. 12 shows the density
maps (expressed as cm−3 and in a logarithmic scale) over time
for the C4.7 class ﬂare. We can observe that the ﬂare footpoints
and ribbons exhibit a higher electron density compared to the
surrounding AR, with values ranging around 1010.2 cm−3 dur-
ing the evaporation phase (at around 01:57 UT) and gradually
increasing up to the high density limit of 1011 cm−3 at around
02:03 UT, just after the peak of the ﬂare. Since the Fe XIV line
ratio reaches the high density limit, we cannot rule out that the
plasma density there is above 1011 cm−3. This is also consistent
with the density diagnostics reported by Doschek et al. (2013),

who showed that the Fe XIV line ratio reaches the high density
limit of 1011 cm−3 during the M-class ﬂare. The density maps
for the C2.0 and C1.0 class ﬂare are reported in the Appendix,
and the values of maximum density observed at the footpoints of
these three ﬂares are summarized in Tab. 4. The absolute errors
associated to these density estimates should include the uncer-
tainty in the atomic data from CHIANTI, as well as the error on
the observed line ratio from EIS, also taking into account of the
contribution of the Si VII blend.

The uncertainty associated with the individual Fe XIV line
intensity is due to the error in the radiometric calibration and
the error associated to the Gaussian ﬁt, this latter error being
very small, around few percent of the intensity values. However,
it should be noted that the uncertainty in the atomic data and
in the radiometric calibration of the EIS throughputs will aﬀect
the density measured during the three ﬂares in the same way.
In this work, we are interested in comparing density measure-
ments obtained in diﬀerent ﬂares and therefore we consider only

the sources of error which are not systematic, that is, the error
associated to the Fe XIV line ratios for the three observations.
A possible approach is to estimate how the uncertainty in the
line ratio can aﬀect the density diagnostics, as shown in Fig.
13. In this ﬁgure, a ± 10% maximum error bar for the line ra-
tios (given by the errors associated to the Gaussian ﬁt and Si VII
blend) is plotted on the y-axis for the three C-class ﬂares. This
error is then propagated on the x-axis (density space), assuming
the same theoretical ratio from CHIANTI (solid curve) for all
the density measurements. This method will give a density in-
terval associated to each measured line ratio, which is reported
in the curved brackets next to each value of density in Tab. 4,
providing an estimate of the relative error in the density values
for the three ﬂares. Fig. 13 shows that this error is smaller if
the density measured is well within the density sensitivity of the
Fe XIV line ratio (i.e. from ≈ 109.5 to less than 1011 cm−3), but
it becomes larger if the density measured is at the edge of the
density sensitivity of the line ratio (around 1011 cm−3). In partic-

sive phase of the C2.0 class ﬂare. The line proﬁle is asymmetric
and has been ﬁtted with two Gaussian components, indicated by
the blue dashed lines.

ular, in this latter case, only a lower value of uncertainty can be
estimated, as the upper limit of the line ratio will be outside the
density sensitivity limit of the line ratio (but still consistent with
a density above 1011 cm−3 considering a 10% uncertainty in the
atomic data, gray lines). Within the estimated errors, the maxi-
mum electron number densities observed during the C1.0 class
ﬂare are lower than the C2.0 and C4.7 ﬂares for both footpoint
K1 and K2, while these latter ﬂares reach in principle similar
values of density at the footpoint K2. However, by comparing
the density maps in Figs. 12, A.2 and A.1, one can observe that
higher densities (above 1010 cm−3) are reached in the C4.7 class
ﬂare at both footpoints for a longer period of time during the
impulsive and peak phase of the ﬂare (note that the three ﬁgures
have the same colour scale).

5. Plasma temperature from AIA observations

Despite the multi-thermal nature of the AIA channels, during
ﬂares the 94 Å and 131 Å AIA channels are dominated by emis-
sion from Fe XVIII (formed at ∼ 7 MK) and Fe XXI (formed
at ∼ 11 MK) respectively (O’Dwyer et al. 2010; Boerner et al.
2014). It has been shown previously that the intensity ratio of
these bands can be used to provide reliable temperature diag-
nostics for the ﬂaring plasma (see e.g. Petkaki et al. 2012; Del
Zanna & Woods 2013). The AIA ﬁlter ratio method relies on
the assumption that the plasma is isothermal and dominated by
plasma formed in the temperature sensitivity range of the AIA
131 and 94 Å ratio (8–12 MK). This is a sensible assumption
close to or during the peak of ﬂares. In fact, Figs. 6 and 9 show
that during the peak of the ﬂares the ﬂare loops are dominated
by emission from the Fe XXIII ion (formed at around 10 MK),
while no emission is observed at that time from cooler emission
lines (e.g. Fe XVI formed at 3 MK and Fe XIV formed at 2 MK).
In Fig. 14, we show the evolution of the plasma temperature
for the three C-class ﬂares using the 131 Å and 94 Å ﬁlter ra-
tio. The AIA images were badly saturated during the peak phase
of the C4.7 and C2.0 class ﬂares and cannot be used for diag-
nosing the temperature. The ﬁrst three panels of Fig. 14 show
the temperature maps for the C4.7, C2.0 and C1.0 class ﬂares,
respectively from top to bottom. These maps were calculated

panels of Fig. 14 allow us to compare the plasma temperature
at the same time into the evolution of the three ﬂares. We note
that two minutes before the peak, the largest C4.7 class ﬂare
reaches higher temperatures (up to logT [K] ≈ 7) than the smaller
C2.0 and C1.0 class ﬂares. The highest temperatures during the
C4.7 ﬂare are observed along the ﬂare ribbons and the spine-like
structure, conﬁrming that this latter feature is dominated by hot
plasma. Moreover, Fig. 14 shows that a high temperature (up to
around 10 MK) is also reached during the small C1.0 class ﬂare,
although only during the peak of the ﬂare.

Assigning an error to the absolute temperature diagnostics is
not straightforward. The largest uncertainty is given by the error
in the calibration of the SDO/AIA ﬁlters, which was estimated
to be ≈ 25 %, including the degradation of the ﬁlter responses
(Boerner et al. 2014). This uncertainty aﬀects the absolute values
of temperature shown in Fig. 14, but we can still make a reliable
comparison between the relative temperatures during the three
ﬂares, since the diagnostics will be aﬀected by the same calibra-
tion error. Excluding the uncertainty in the ﬁlter calibration, the
relative values of temperature will then be mainly be aﬀected by
the error in the total counts measured in the 131 Å and 94 Å ﬁl-
ters, which is given by the standard deviation, i.e. the square root
of the total counts. We estimated this error to result in a rela-
tive uncertainty of only around 1–2% for the temperature values
shown in Fig. 14.

6. Analysis of the magnetic ﬁeld structure during

the recurrent ﬂares

6.1. NLFFF extrapolation

The HMI instrument (Scherrer et al. 2012) provides full disk
vector magnetograms at 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) pixel size and 12 minutes cadence.
The vector magnetogram of AR11429 at 01:12UT of March 9,
2012, is included in the patch 1449 of the HARP catalogue1.
The standard SHARP data products are treated for the removal
of the ambiguity in the direction of the transverse ﬁeld, as well
as Cylindrical Equal Area projection remapping (see Hoeksema
et al. 2014, for more details). The area of interest was extracted
from the HARP patch data, the resolution was halved using a
ﬂux-conserving coarsening, and a median smoothing with a 7-
pixel boxcar was applied to all three ﬁeld components to reduce
small-scale ﬂuctuations.

The compatibility of the vector magnetogram as a boundary
condition for the NLFFF extrapolation can be improved by pre-
processing the magnetogram to reduce Lorentz forces (see, e.g.
Schrijver et al. 2008). For that purpose, we employed the tech-

1 http://jsoc.stanford.edu/doc/data/hmi/harp/harp deﬁnitive/

2012/03/09/

nique by Fuhrmann et al. (2007), which allows one to ﬁx a limit
to the modiﬁcations of each observed component separately. In
particular, in the present application, preprocessing was applied
to the horizontal components only. The maximum variation of
these measured values was constrained, in each pixel, by the
largest value between 50G and 30% of the local value. These
maximal ranges of variation resulted in an average modiﬁcation
of 45 G (respectively, 51 G) in the Bx (respectively, By) compo-
nent, and in a decrease of the total Lorentz force on the magne-
togram from 0.13 before preprocessing to 0.03 after preprocess-
ing, according to the deﬁnition used in Metcalf et al. (2008).

The preprocessed vector magnetogram was then extrapo-
lated to build the coronal ﬁeld model using the implementa-
tion of the magneto-frictional method described in Valori et al.
(2010) with open lateral and top boundaries and on three lev-
els of successive grid reﬁnement. The resulting numerical model
has a fraction of current perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld in
the volume equal to 0.4. This is concentrated in the lower vol-
ume directly connected to the residual Lorentz forces in the mag-
netogram: indeed, the horizontal plane-average fraction of the
current density perpendicular to the ﬁeld drops with height to
2% within the ﬁrst 15 pixels. The relatively high forces are due
partly to the system being between dynamical phases (i.e. the
ﬂare C1.0 ﬂare at 00:34UT and the C2.0 ﬂare at 01:23UT, see
Tab. 1), but also to the very limited preprocessing applied to
the magnetogram. Despite the limited preprocessing, however,
the fraction of the magnetic energy associated with errors in the
solenoidal property, and quantiﬁed by applying the method in
Valori et al. (2013), is limited to 4%.

Due to the presence of nonzero ﬁeld divergences and Lorentz
forces, the NLFFF extrapolations must be compared with obser-
vational proxies of the magnetic conﬁguration. In particular, in
order to compare AIA observations with the NLFFF extrapola-
tion, an approximate alignment was performed using the LoS-
magnetogram from the HMI instrument. When included in the
3D extrapolated volume, the HMI-image plane was rotated so
as to be tangent to the center of the ﬁeld of view of the vec-
tor magnetogram at the bottom of the extrapolation datacube.
Next, the image was stretched and scaled until the PIL of the
LoS-magnetogram coincided with the PIL of the vertical ﬁeld
of the vector magnetogram. The geometrical transformation of
the LoS-magnetogram obtained in this way was then applied to
all AIA images. Such a procedure is necessarily approximate
in many respects, not least because of the diﬀerent heights at
which the LoS-magnetogram and AIA images are displayed in
the observer’s projection. Therefore, such comparisons can only
be considered to be qualitative.

The underlying topology of the NLFFF extrapolation is most
eﬃciently studied using the distribution of the quasi-separatrix
layers (see, e.g. Demoulin et al. 1996), which represent volumes

13

V. Polito et al.: Analysis and modelling of recurrent solar ﬂares observed with Hinode/EIS on March 9, 2012

of sharp gradients in the ﬁeld line connectivity. The connec-
tivity gradient is quantiﬁed by the squashing degree Q (Titov
et al. 2002), and is computed here using the method in Pariat
& D´emoulin (2012). In the photospheric Q-map obtained in this
way, high values of Q correspond to separations between diﬀer-
ent areas of connectivity.

Note that the AIA images and the line-of-sight magnetogram
from SDO/HMI in Fig. 15 are on the (observer) image plane,
whereas the vector magnetogram used for the NLFFF extrapola-
tion was re-mapped to a Cartesian grid using a CEA projection
(see Sect. 6.1). A careful comparison between the middle panel
of Fig. 15 and the online AIA Movies 1 and 2 also shows a good
match between individual dark strands forming the ﬁlament, and
individual sections of the ﬂux rope/sheared structure above the
PIL in the NLFFF extrapolation (for instance, the brown south-
ern ﬁeld lines, or the core group of red/violet/blue ﬁeld lines in
Fig. 15). In addition, the elongated spine-like structure in the
core, which is already recognizable at this time in the top panel
of Fig. 15, has a good correspondence with the spine-like blue
ﬁeld lines bundle in the extrapolation (see below for the identi-
ﬁcation of the associated blue fan-like ﬁeld lines at its eastern
end). Such details corroborate the quality of the extrapolation
despite the limitations discussed in Sect. 6.1.

6.2. Magnetic ﬁeld analysis

By comparing some selected ﬁeld lines from the extrapolation
with simultaneous (at ≈ 01:12UT) EUV images from AIA, one
can readily recognize the elongated ﬁlament corresponding to
the sheared and twisted ﬂux system along the PIL (see Fig. 15).

01:12 UT, zoom on the ribbon region (top), and selected ﬁeld
lines from the NLFFF extrapolation (bottom). The color coding
in the latter represents the magnetic ﬁeld strength.

The magnetic helicity of the NLFFF extrapolation, computed
following the method in Valori et al. (2012), is −2.7 × 1043Mx2
(corresponding to 0.05 in units of ﬂux squared). Estimations of
the helicity of the same active region (but for 24 hours before)
were performed by Patsourakos et al. (2016b) using three dif-
ferent methods, with values ranging from -0.4×1043 Mx2 to -
3.3 ×1043 Mx2. The value obtained with a NLFFF extrapolation
comparable with ours (Chintzoglou et al. 2015b) is -0.8 ×1043
Mx2, which is consistent with our value considering the time
span between the two extrapolations.

The free energy, estimated as in Valori et al. (2013), is 27.4%
of the total magnetic energy, which is a value almost 7 times
larger than the error associated with a violation of the solenoidal
property in the ﬁeld. Therefore, the extrapolation shows beyond

doubt that the AR under study had signiﬁcantly high values of
both free energy and helicity, and was thus in a non-potential
state. Next, we can use the NLFFF extrapolation at 01:12UT to

the location of the ﬂaring structure (see also the bottom panel of
Fig. 16 where the color-coded ﬁeld lines show large ﬁeld values
everywhere). In order to clarify this point, we study the Quasi-
Separatrix Layers (QSLs) that can be obtained from the NLFFF
extrapolation. The left panel of Fig. 17 shows the distribution
of the squashing degree Q at the photospheric level, while in
the right panel we trace the separatrix ﬁeld lines at the location
of the bald patches (BP, i.e. locations where the magnetic ﬁeld
is tangent to the photosphere and concave-up, Titov et al. 1993).
The resulting ﬁeld structure (right panel of Fig. 17) includes both
a linear structure along the PIL as well as a dome structure.

The BP ﬁeld lines thus show that the linear and dome fea-
tures are pseudo-spine and pseudo-fan structures, but are not
a true spine/fan topology coming from a null. However, being
separatrices, as discussed in (D´emoulin 2006), they are pref-
erential sites for the build-up of thin current sheets and hence
for magnetic reconnection. This has been previously shown in
e.g. Billinghurst et al. (1993); Pariat et al. (2009) and references
therein. In the NLFFF extrapolation, such currents extend to also
include the volume around the pseudo-spine structure, as shown
in the bottom panel of Fig. 18. Note that the shape of the ﬁeld
lines associated with the brightening is identiﬁed with a pseudo-
fan/spine albeit in the absence of a coronal null point, as shown
in Fig. 16. From the QSL spatial distribution in Fig. 17, it is
therefore evident that the semi-circular structure appearing as
a semi-circular ribbon in the observations is actually the pho-
tospheric anchoring of the dome magnetic structure. Moreover,
the location of the kernels K1 and K2 shown in Sect. 2.2 can be
equally associated with the dome of the pseudo-fan structure, cf.
Fig. 6 and Fig. 17.

Hence, on the grounds of the NLFFF extrapolation and the
QSL study obtained from it, we argue that the homologous ﬂares
observed as the repeated brightenings of the K1 and K2 kernels
are the result of bald patch reconnection involving one single
magnetic structure, which is likely to be excited by the same re-
current mechanism (e.g. ﬂux emergence and/or shearing motion
in the pseudo-fan area). The role of BPs in active events such as
ﬂares, surges, jets and brightenings, has been extensively stud-
ied, see e.g. Aulanier et al. (1998); Mandrini et al. (2002); Peter
et al. (2014). Reconnection at BPs has been observed, in the
framework of ﬂux emergence, in several simulations: Archontis
& Hood (2009); Cheung et al. (2010); Archontis et al. (2013);
Takasao et al. (2015). The shape of the brightenings is reminis-
cent of a typical null/fan topology but no null is present in the
coronal ﬁeld: in the relevant volume connecting the fan-like and
the spine-like structure the magnetic ﬁeld is of the order of ∼ 100
G (see Fig. 16). This is also conﬁrmed by the absence in the vec-
tor magnetogram of the parasitic polarity that would correspond
to the anchoring of the inner spine in a proper null-point topol-
ogy, as the top panel of Fig. 18 shows. Such a conﬁguration is
theoretically possible if a null point is located below the photo-
spheric plane.

7. Discussion

interpret some of the observations at a later time, on the grounds
that the conﬁguration is not changing radically in the follow-
ing 48 minutes preceding the C2.0 ﬂare (as shown by the AIA
Movies 1 and 2 and Fig. 2). In particular, we search for an in-
terpretation of the semi-circular and spine-like features which
are simultaneously illuminated during all the ﬂares, an example
being shown in Fig. 16.

First, using a null ﬁnder algorithm (D´emoulin et al. 1994) we
did not ﬁnd any null point in the NLFFF extrapolation around

In this work, we have presented an analysis of a series of recur-
rent solar ﬂares based on spectroscopic, multi-wavelength imag-
ing and photospheric magnetic ﬁeld observations. These obser-
vations provide a powerful tool to compare the physical param-
eters of the plasma in diﬀerent ﬂares occurring in the same AR
and to investigate the mechanisms behind their homologous na-
ture.

We analysed three conﬁned C-class ﬂares (C1.0, C2.0 and
C4.7), which were observed during a single EIS observing se-

15

V. Polito et al.: Analysis and modelling of recurrent solar ﬂares observed with Hinode/EIS on March 9, 2012

(around 177 s after the beginning of the ﬂare as measured in the
soft X-ray ﬂux). During the C4.7 class ﬂare, blueshifted veloci-
ties of around 145 km s−1 are measured by EIS at the same K1
footpoint around 300 s after the beginning of the ﬂare as mea-
sured in the soft X-ray ﬂux. In addition, Doschek et al. (2013)
measured 150–200 km s−1 upﬂows during the M-class ﬂare over
almost the entire raster between 03:24:52 UT to 03:40:42 UT.
This seems to suggest that the magnitude of the maximum up-
ﬂows are indeed similar (within the range 150–200 km s−1) for
the C2.0, C4.7 (at the footpoint K1) and M1.8 recurrent ﬂares
studied here. Simultaneously, the blueshifts of the Fe XVI line
at 3 MK are observed to be within the range of ≈ 40–60 km s−1
at the K1 footpoint of the C2.0 class ﬂare and at the ribbon of
the M-class ﬂare. The C4.7 class ﬂare shows a large Fe XVI
blueshift velocity of around 76 km s−1 at the footpoint K1;
however, this value has a large uncertainty due to the double
Gaussian ﬁt of the line proﬁle.

Moreover, the observed Fe XXIII and Fe XVI blueshifts dur-
ing the C2.0 conﬁned ﬂare, where, in contrast to the M-class
ﬂare, two footpoint sources K1 and K2 could be clearly distin-
guished, seem to be larger in K1 than in K2. The diﬀerence in the
evaporating ﬂows from the two footpoints is lower for the C4.7
class ﬂare. Diﬀerent evaporating ﬂows at the two kernels could
be related to an asymmetry in the mechanism responsible for the
heating of the plasma at the chromospheric loop footpoints, that
is, for instance, diﬀerently accelerated electron beams (in the
context of the collisional thick-target ﬂare model). Asymmetric
HXR footpoint sources have often been observed (e.g. Li et al.
1997; Aschwanden et al. 1999) and are generally interpreted as
being due to a diﬀerence in strength in the photospheric mag-
netic ﬁeld at the two footpoints. In case of a weaker magnetic
ﬁeld, the electrons are in fact less aﬀected by magnetic mirror
and are more able to reach and heat the chromosphere. However,
some ﬂares have been observed not to ﬁt in this scenario (e.g.
Asai et al. 2002). In addition, asymmetric HXR sources (and
thus diﬀerent evaporation) at the footpoints could also be ex-
plained by the injection of an electron beam along one of the
ﬂare loops rather than at the loop apex (Falewicz & Siarkowski
2007).

Based on the use of the Fe XIV 264/274 Å density-sensitive
line ratio, the EIS spectroscopic observations also provide esti-
mates for the electron number density of the 2 MK plasma dur-
ing the recurrent ﬂares. Our measurements suggest that, for all
the ﬂares under study, the electron density increases by around
an order of magnitude or more at the ﬂare footpoints compared
to the background regions during the impulsive phase, in agree-
ment with previous studies (e.g. Del Zanna et al. 2011a; Polito
et al. 2016). For each ﬂare, the densities at the two footpoints are
similar within the errors and change over time, as shown in the
density maps in Figs. 12, A.2 and A.1. In addition, within the er-
rors, lower values of density are observed during the C1.0 ﬂare
(≈ 1010.0−10.2 cm−3) than the C2.0 (≈ 1010.4−10.7 cm−3) and the
C4.7 (1011 cm−3 or more) class ﬂares at both footpoints. Taking
into account the relative uncertainty in the measurements, the
maximum value of density reached during the C4.7 class ﬂare is
higher than that of the C2.0 ﬂare at the footpoint K1, while it is
similar within the errors at the footpoint K2. On the other hand,
measurements of the density over time show that very high val-
ues (above the density sensitivity limit) are obtained for a longer
period time during the impulsive phase of the C4.7 ﬂare (see
Fig. 12). In addition, the M-class ﬂare studied by Doschek et al.
(2013) also shows densities reaching the 1011 cm−3 high den-
sity limit. It should be noted that a correlation between emission
measure (EM) of the plasma (EM ∝ N2
e) and the soft X-ray

quence, and compared the results with the observations of the
last M1.8 class eruptive ﬂare seen during a full-spectrum EIS
study, as reported by Doschek et al. (2013).

All the recurrent ﬂares occurred within a short period of time
(≈ 3 hours and a half in total) and show a very similar plasma
morphology and magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. In particular, they
are all characterized by the appearance of bright and compact
footpoint sources of upﬂowing plasma along the quasi-circular
ribbon and the continuous activation of a spine-like hot plasma
structure strongly emitting in Fe XXI and Fe XXIII emission
(≈ 10 MK), as observed by AIA and EIS.

By comparing the upﬂows measured at the ﬂare footpoints
in the EIS Fe XXIII line, we found similar values of blueshifts
velocity (of the order of 150–200 km s−1) in the C2.0, C4.7
(at the footpoint K1) and M1.8 class ﬂares. The Fe XXIII emis-
sion is too faint to be observed at the beginning of the smallest
C1.0 ﬂare impulsive phase and is only observed around the peak
phase, when the evaporation phase is likely to have already been
concluded.

However, it should be noted that the cadence of the EIS
raster (around 3 min) is comparable to the duration of the im-
pulsive phase of the three conﬁned ﬂares under study, which is
around 3–4 mins, as shown by the GOES light curves in Fig.
1. Hence, it would not be surprising if higher upﬂow velocities
were reached during the chromospheric evaporation phase but
were missed by the EIS slit. We emphasize that the spectrometer
rasters over the ﬂare footpoints at diﬀerent times into the im-
pulsive phase of each ﬂare. For instance, high velocities (≈ 200
km s−1) are measured during the C2.0 class ﬂare at the footpoint
K1 at the very beginning of the impulsive phase of this ﬂare

16

ﬂux was also observed by previous authors, e.g. Feldman et al.
(1996), Battaglia et al. (2005).

Given that similar velocities are observed during ﬂares of
diﬀerent size, an increase in the electron number density with
larger peak soft X-ray ﬂux would indeed be expected in order
to satisfy conservation of momentum of the plasma evaporating
from the ﬂare kernels and ﬁlling the ﬂare loops (in the context of
the standard model of ﬂares). For instance, assuming the same
size for the C2.0 and C4.7 ﬂare footpoint sources (as observed
within the EIS spatial resolution), the ratio between the peak
soft X-ray energy of the two ﬂares is around a factor of ≈ 2.3
(4.7/2.0) from the GOES measurements. This value is consistent
with the ratio of density values measured during the two ﬂares
(i.e. 1011/1010.6 ≈ 2.5).

Finally,

the temperature diagnostics based on the AIA
131/94 Å line ratio show that high temperature plasma (≈ 10
MK) is observed at the ﬂare footpoints and spine-like struc-
ture, as also conﬁrmed by the spectroscopic measurements in the
Fe XXIII line with EIS. In addition, by comparing the tempera-
ture diagnostics during the three conﬁned ﬂares, we observe that
slightly higher temperatures (around 10 % higher with a relative
uncertainty of 1–2%) are reached a few minutes before the peak
of the C4.7 ﬂare than those of the other two ﬂares. It is empha-
sized that an increase in the electron temperature with peak soft
X-ray ﬂux of the ﬂare is in agreement with previous results by
e.g. Feldman et al. (1996). However, since the AIA images are
badly saturated during the peak of the C2.0 and C4.7 class ﬂares,
reliable temperature measurements and conclusive comparisons
cannot be obtained.

In order to understand the context of the observed events
and investigate the mechanism responsible for the homologous
ﬂares, we performed a NLFFF extrapolation of the 3D mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration in the corona. The NLFFF extrapolation
catches the global topology and provides a good agreement with
the location of the quasi-circular ribbon and the 10 MK spine-
like structure observed in AIA 131 Å. The extrapolation pro-
vides the magnetic ﬁeld context that is suﬃcient to interpret
and explain the locations of all brightenings involved in the
(non-eruptive) ﬂares (kernels, spine, semi-circular brightenings)
which have been studied.

The semi-circular ribbon shape is similar to those created by
the presence of a coronal null point, plus an associated spine-
like structure connected to the circular one. However, there is
no coronal null point, not just because it is absent in the NLFFF
extrapolation, but because the observed photospheric ﬁeld does
not show the parasitic polarity necessary for its existence in the
corona. Instead, bald patch reconnection activates a magnetic
structure consisting of a pseudo-fan and pseudo-spine. Such a
conﬁguration is conceivable as the geometrical prolongation in
the corona of a sub-photospheric null point structure. On the
basis of the NLFFF and the QSL study, we argue that the ho-
mologous ﬂares were all generated by a repetition of the same
process, namely bald patch reconnection.

We interpret the time evolution of the GOES ﬂuxes in Fig.
1 and the temperature distribution estimations in Fig. 14 as in-
dications of a progressive increase in energy of the events con-
sidered. Within the validity of the linear force-free theory, Valori
et al. (2015) derives the relation

∆Efree (cid:39)

Hm∆α

(1)

that relates the drop in free energy ∆Efree due to a ﬂare to the
change in the force-free parameter ∆α and the relative magnetic

helicity of the whole active region, Hm. The considered homolo-
gous ﬂares are repetitions of roughly the same reconnection pro-
cess, hence, in the spirit of the linear theory, we can represent the
change in connectivity producing them as a similar change ∆α
in the linear parameter characterizing the ﬁeld. Since the active
region is in an emerging phase with increasing energy (and helic-
ity) over several days (Dhakal & Zhang 2016), then Eq. 1 shows
that the same (small) drop in ∆ α generates ﬂares that are higher
and higher in energy, due to the increased accumulated helicity
in time. In this sense, Eq. 1 provides a simple explanation why
homologous ﬂares often show a progressive increase in energy,
as it does for the case under examination, see Fig. 1. However,
this simple explanation is based on the linear theory, and inherits
its limited range of applicability, especially when dealing with
fully non-linear conﬁgurations, as in the case treated here.

The EIS observations in this work, coupled with the mod-
elling of the magnetic ﬁeld structure based on the NLFFF extrap-
olation, provide important information on the physical condition
of the plasma and the reconnection process during the recurrent
ﬂares. In particular, the plasma parameters obtained by the anal-
ysis of the EIS spectra provide constraints for hydrodynamical
models using diﬀerent values of total energy inputs (for each
ﬂare) and based on diﬀerent heating mechanisms, such as elec-
tron beams or conduction fronts, assuming diﬀerent time proﬁles
and geometries for the heating injection.

In order to conﬁrm the results of the comparative analysis
presented in this work, future spectroscopic studies of recurrent
ﬂares would need higher temporal cadence observations at the
same footpoint source. This could best be achieved with an EIS
sit-and-stare rather than a raster observing mode. On the other
hand, raster observations oﬀer the advantage of observing both
footpoint sources, but higher cadence than the one used in this
study would still be desirable.
