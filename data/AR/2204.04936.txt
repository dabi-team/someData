Abstract: We present here the kinematics of the EUV wave associated with a GOES M1.0-
class  solar  flare,  which  originates  in  NOAA  AR  12740.  The  event  is  thoroughly  observed 
with  Atmospheric  Imaging  Assembly  (AIA)  onboard  Solar  Dynamics  Observatory  (SDO) 
with  high  spatio-temporal  resolutions.  This  event  displays  many  features  of  EUV  waves, 
which  are  very  decisive  for  the  understanding  of  the  nature  of  EUV waves.  These  features 
include: a fast-mode wave, a pseudo wave, a slow-mode wave and stationary fronts, probably 
due  to  mode  conversion.  One  fast-mode  wave  also  propagates  towards  the  coronal  hole 
situated close to the north pole and the wave speed does not change when  it encounters the 
coronal  hole.  We  intend  to  provide  self-consistent  interpretations  for  all  these  different 
features.

1.  Introduction 

As one of the most energetic phenomena in the solar atmosphere, solar flares 
are  often  related  to  other  solar-terrestrial  activities,  such  as  coronal  mass  ejections 
(CMEs),  extreme  ultra-violet  (EUV)  waves,  energetic  particles,  and  geomagnetic 
storms. The source of energy for solar flares is coronal magnetic field, and magnetic 
reconnection  is  the  widely-accepted  mechanism  for  them  [1–4].  According  to  their 
association  with  CMEs,  they  can  be classified  into  two  categories,  i.e., eruptive and 
confined [5]. Eruptive  flares  are  associated  with  CMEs  [6],  whereas  confined  flares 
are  often  associated  with  plasmoid  ejections  (see  the  review  by  [4]).  On  the  other 
hand,  according  to  the  temporal  evolution,  solar  flares  are  again  classified  into  two 
types,  i.e.,  long-duration  events  and  impulsive  events  [2,4].  It  was  found  that  long-
duration events are normally eruptive flares which are associated with CMEs, whereas 
impulsive events are often not eruptive in nature (e.g., [2]). However, there are cases 
where impulsive flares are also associated with CMEs [7,8]. 

The  effects  of  intense  eruptive  events  are  not  localized,  and  might  influence 
the whole solar atmosphere [9]. One of the global effects is EUV waves, which might 
loops, 
induce  oscillations  of 
filaments/prominences  and  coronal  cavities  [10–15].  EUV  waves  are  known  as 
several  names,  for  example,  EIT  waves,  coronal  waves,  coronal  propagating  fronts 

remote  coronal  structures 

including  coronal

(CPFs), and so on [16–18]. For simplicity,  here  we use EUV waves to describe any 
wavelike phenomena observed in EUV, bearing  in mind that there are probably two 
types of EUV waves [19]. EUV waves are defined as the  arc-shaped bright features 
(occasionally they can be in an almost complete circular shape) propagating across the 
majority of the solar disk, which were discovered via the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging 
Telescope  (EIT;  [20])  about  two  and  half  decades  ago  [16,21].  Since  they  were 
discovered via the EIT telescope, they were initially called “EIT waves”. EUV waves 
are  associated  with  solar  flares,  filament/prominence  eruptions  and  CMEs.  Initially, 
they  were  attributed  to  the  pressure  enhancement  by  flares,  but  soon  it was  realized 
that they are intimately related to CMEs [22–24]. 

After the discovery of EUV waves, extensive discussions were ongoing about 
their kinematics and their nature [13,25–30]. From the propagation characteristics, it 
seems that a fast-mode wave (or shock wave)  is  followed by a  slower pseudo wave 
component. The fast-mode wave component is an MHD wave or even shock wave. Its 
wave  nature  is  manifested  as  the  wave  reflection  and  refraction  [31].  Due  to  their 
wave nature, people can use them as a tool in coronal seismology. On the other hand, 
the slower pseudo wave component of EUV waves travels with a speed several times 
smaller than the fast-mode wave speed in the corona [16,32]. The slower component 
was observed to stop at the footpoints of the magnetic separatrix [33]. 

To  explain  the  EUV  wave  phenomena,  several  models  have  been  proposed, 
including  the  fast-mode  wave  model,  slow-mode  soliton  model,  magnetoacoustic 
surface gravity waves, current shell, reconnection front model and hybrid model (for 
details  of  these  models  please  see  the  review  by  Warmuth  [9]).  The  hybrid  model 
proposed  by  Chen  et  al.  [34,35]  is  the  most  suitable  model  to  explain  the  two 
components,  i.e.,  a  fast-mode  wave  component  and  a  pseudo  wave  component. 
According  to  this  model,  the  faster  outer  front  is  interpreted  as  a  fast-mode  MHD 
wave  or  shock  wave,  whereas  the  inner  slower  component  corresponds  to  plasma 
compression due to successive stretching of magnetic field lines which are pushed by 
an erupting flux rope. 

With  the  SDO  observations  in  unprecedented  spatio-temporal  resolutions, 
many new observational features have been discovered. One of the newly-discovered 
interesting  properties  of  EUV  waves  is  that  when  the  fast-mode  component  of  an 
EUV wave travels through a separatrix or quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), a stationary 
bright front is generated while the fast-mode wave keeps moving with much reduced 
intensity [36]. A QSL is a generalization of separatrix and is defined as regions where 
the  connectivity  of  magnetic  field  lines  drastically  changes,  but  remains  continuous 
[37,38].  They  often  appear  in  active  regions,  coronal  streamer  edges,  and  the 
boundary of coronal holes. Such a feature was later confirmed by more observations 
[29,39].  The  generation  of the  stationary  front  was  explained  by  Chen  et  al.  [40]  to 
result from mode conversion from the fast-mode wave to the slow-mode wave, which 
is then trapped in coronal loops, and stops near the footpoints of QSLs. 

The objective of this study was to look into the  multi-wavelength and multi-
viewpoint  observations  of  the  EUV  wave  event  on  6  May  2019. The  manuscript  is 
organized as follows: In Section 2, the observational datasets are presented. The flare 
morphology  and  the  EUV  wave  kinematics  are  presented  in  Sections  3  and  4, 
respectively. The discussion and the summary are given in Section 5.

2.  Observational Data Sets 

The observations of the event are available in different wavelengths from the 
Atmospheric  Imaging  Assembly  (AIA)  [41]  on  board  Solar  Dynamics  Observatory 
(SDO) [42] satellite. The cadence and the pixel size of the AIA data are 12 s and 0.6 
arcsec, respectively. For our current study, we used AIA 171, 193, and 1600 Å data 
due to the clarity of the event in these wavelengths. The event was also observed by 
the STEREO-A spacecraft from a different viewing angle with a cadence of 5 min and 
a spatial resolution of 1.6 arcsec and the EUV wave event was well visible in 195 Å. 
Therefore,  for  the  other  viewing  angle,  we  used  the  STEREO-A  195  Å  data.  In 
addition, for the magnetic field connectivity, we used the data from the Helioseismic 
Magnetic  Imager  (HMI:  [43])  on  board  the  SDO  satellite.  The  pixel  resolution  and 
cadence of the HMI dataset are 0.5 arcsec and 45 s respectively. 

For  information  on  the  coronal  magnetic  configuration,  we  extrapolate  the 
coronal magnetic field based on the synoptic map of the magnetic field at 06:00 UT 
on 6 May 2019 using the potential field source surface (PFSS) model. Note that the 
magnetic  field  in  a  synoptic  map  was  usually  obtained  over  a  time  span  of  a 
Carrington period. In this paper we update the radial magnetic field distribution for all 
the pixels with a heliocentric angle less than 60◦ with the HMI magnetogram at 06:00 
UT  on  6  May  2019  in  order  to  obtain  the  instantaneous  coronal  magnetic 
configuration. 

3.  Flare Morphology 

Here  we  describe the  GOES  M1.0-class  solar  flare  on  6  May  2019  from  the 
NOAA active region (AR) 12740. The AR appeared at the east limb on 4 May 2019 
as the  α-type  magnetic  configuration  and  arrived  at the  west  limb on  16 May  2019. 
The AR produced 15 GOES C-class flares during its disk passage. It was the only AR 
on  the  solar  surface  on  6  May,  when  it  was  located  at  N08E49  with  the  βγ-type 
magnetic  configuration.  The  βγ-type  magnetic  configuration  is  defined as  a  sunspot 
group, which has a general β-type magnetic configuration but contains one (or more) 
δ sunspots. Out of the fifteen flares during the passage of the AR over the solar disk, 
seven  C-class  flares  were  produced  on  6  May  2019.  According  to  GOES  satellite 
observations,  the  flare  under  study  started  at  ≈05:05  UT,  peaked  at  ≈05:10  UT  and 
ended at ≈05:12 UT. The GOES X-ray light curves of the flare are shown in Figure 1. 
As  we  can  see  from  the  light  curves,  the  flare  was  very  impulsive  in  nature  and  its 
total  duration  was  very  short  (about  8  min).  In  the  decay  phase  of  the  flare,  GOES 
observed  a  small  bump  at  05:16  UT.  The  morphology  of  the  flare  in  AIA  171  and 
1600 Å at the three selected times (shown by vertical dashed lines in the GOES light 
curve)  is  displayed  in  the  middle  and  bottom  panels  of  Figure  1.  At  these 
wavelengths, the flare started at ≈05:06 UT as a ‘C’-shaped structure, as indicated by 
the arrow in panel (c1). At around 05:10 UT, the ‘C’-shaped ribbon changed to two 
bright kernels marked as ‘K1’ and ‘K2’, respectively. The kernel ‘K1’ was bright until 
05:17:26  UT  and  ‘K2’  remained  bright  until  05:29:02  UT.  At  05:13  UT,  the  third 
kernel ‘K3’ appeared and attained its maximum intensity at 05:16 UT, with a life-time 
of seven  minutes.  The  locations  of  these  three  kernels  are shown  in  panels (c2) and 
(c3) of the figure. The appearance of kernel ‘K3’ was coincident with the small bump 
observed in the decay phase of GOES X-ray light curve.

and bottom panels (i.e., panels b1–b3 and c1–c3): Snapshots of the flare evolution at the times 
indicated by the vertical dashed lines in panel (a). The red arrow in panel (b2) indicates the 
mass  ejected  out  of  the  flaring  region.  K1,  K2,  and  K3  are  three  flare  kernels  shown  by  the 
black arrows in the bottom panels. 

The flare was associated with a very weak CME. According to LASCO CME catalog 
https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/daily_movies/2019/05/06/,  accessed  at  6  May 
2019 [44]), the speed of the associated CME was ≈240 km s−1 and its angular width 
was 53o. 

4.  EUV Wave Kinematics  

An  interesting  aspect  of  this  CME/flare  event  is  the  associated  EUV  waves. 
Here we present the EUV wave kinematics. After the flare onset at ≈05:04 UT, EUV 
waves were visible travelling away from the eruption source region, which was in the 
AR 12740. The evolution of the wave  in the AIA 193 Å base-difference images are 
depicted  in  Figure  2.  From  the  figure,  it  is  inferred  that  initially  the  EUV  wave 
phenomenon was manifested as a bright arc-shaped front and it was bright until 05:20 
UT. As time progressed, the wave became fainter and fainter, and the major part of 
the  wave  moved  towards  the  west  direction.  The  wave  was  followed  by  dimmings, 

 
 
 
 
 
5 

clearly  visible  in  the  AIA  193  Å  basedifference  images.  We  also  inspected  the 
evolution of the wave  in the STEREO-A 195 Å images. Figure 3 presents the wave 
evolution in the STEREO-A 195 Å base-difference images. The wave  first appeared 
at  05:10:30  UT  when  it  was  20000  away  from  the  origin  site.  It  propagated  mainly 
along the northwest direction, which is different from the AIA observations. The EUV 
wave did not appear earlier because of the low cadence of the STEREO observations, 
i.e.,  5  min.  For  a  clearer  view  of  this  EUV  wave  event,  we  refer  the  readers  to  the 
supplemented AIA and STEREO-A animations. 

Figure  2.  Evolution  of  the  base  difference  images  in  AIA  193  Å  revealing  the  wave 
propagation.  The  base  image  is  selected  at  04:50:04  UT.  The  pink  arrows  indicate  the 
propagation of the wave. 

In order to understand the kinematics of the EUV wave event, we present here 
the  kinematic  properties  of  the  EUV  wave  event  in  different  directions.  For  this 
purpose, we first selected a slice starting from the source region, i.e., S1 as indicated 
in panel (a) of Figure 4. The slice was towards the northwest direction, ending inside 
the coronal hole region with a distance of ≈700”. The boundary of the coronal hole is 
marked  by  the  blue  line in  panel  (a)  of the  figure.  The  wave  propagation  along  this 
selected direction is plotted in panel (b) of Figure 4. According to this plot, the onset 

 
 
 
 
 
6 

of  the  EUV  wave  was  at  ≈05:09  UT,  which  is  about  100”  from  the  flare  source 
location. Since the  solar flare peaked at 05:10 UT when the EUV  wave  had already 
propagated  150”  away  from  the  flaring  loops,  our  results  once  again  imply  that  the 
EUV  wave  is  not  driven  by  the  pressure  pulse  in  the  solar  flare,  and  it  should  be 
driven by the CME, as claimed by Chen [23]. The bright ridge in Figure 4b means an 
EUV  wave  was  propagating  outward  along  the  slice.  In  order  to  calculate  the  front 
speed, we fit the bright ridge with a straight line. The computed speed was ≈640 ± 8 
km s−1. One interesting feature in Figure 4b is that the front speed changes little across 
the boundary of the coronal hole.

propagation.  The  base  image  is  selected  at  04:50:30  UT.  The  cyan  arrows  indicate  the 
propagation of the wave. 

Since EUV waves are  strongly anisotropic, we selected another two slices to 
see the wave kinematics along the corresponding directions, which are marked as ‘S2’ 
and  ‘S3’  in  panel  (a)  of  Figure  4  as  indicated  by  the  cyan  and  green  arrows.  The 
corresponding  time–distance  diagrams  are  plotted  in  panels  (c)  and  (d)  of  the  same 
figure. Along the slice S2, it is seen that a bright EUV wave front propagated out with 
a  speed  of  802  ±  15  km  s−1,  which  then  decelerated  to  350  ±  3  km  s−1.  The 

 
 
 
 
 
7 

propagation speed is typical for fast-mode EUV waves. On the other hand, we can see 
the propagation of patchy EUV fronts. The  apparent  velocity of the patchy  fronts  is 
208 ± 10 km s−1, about four times slower than the fast-mode EUV wave. Along the 
slice S3, the onset of the EUV wave in this direction was at the same time as in the S1 
direction, i.e., 05:09 UT. However, the evolution of its wave fronts is much different 
from slice ‘S1’. It is seen that from 05:09 to 05:13 UT, only one wave was observed to 
propagate to a distance of ∼400ʺ, which had a speed of 800 ± 12 km s−1. Interestingly, 
after  05:13  UT,  the  EUV  wave  bifurcated  into  two  fronts.  The  speeds  of  these  two 
fronts were markedly smaller than those in the initial phase. The outer front travelled 
with a speed of about 250 ± 3 km s−1. It kept almost a constant speed until 05:27 UT, 
when another stationary front was generated at a distance of 700ʺ. Since such a place 
corresponds to another QSL, it is expected that wave mode conversion happened here 
as well. The inner front travelled with a speed of 160 ± 2 km s−1 until 05:23 UT. After 
that, this inner wave front nearly stopped at the footpoints of the magnetic field lines.

boundary of the polar coronal hole. Three slices (S1, S2 and S3) are selected in order to plot 
the time-distance diagrams of the AIA 193 Å intensity, which are displayed in panels (b–d), 
respectively.

5.  Summary and Discussions 

In this paper, we presented an EUV wave event accompanied by a GOES M1.0-class 
solar flare. The main points of this study are as follows: 

  Despite  the  flare  being  impulsive  and  compact  in  nature,  it  was  associated  with  a 

weak CME. Similar events were studied before [7,45–47]. 

  The EUV wave event is strongly anisotropic. We selected three slices along different 
directions.  It  is  seen  that  along  the  northwest  direction  S1,  only  one  wave  was 
detected, and the propagation speed was 640 ± 8 km s−1. Along the west direction S3, 
only one wave was detected initially, with a speed of 800 ± 12 km s−1.  However,  it 
split  into two fronts with much smaller speeds, i.e., 250 ± 3 km s−1 and 160 ± 2 km 
s−1, respectively. Along the direction S2, which is between S1 and S3, we detected two 
EUV  waves,  one  is  the  fast-mode  wave,  and  the  other  one  is  a  pseudo-wave  with 
patchy fronts. 

In our case, we observed that the interaction between the EUV wave and the coronal 
hole did not change the front speed, and the EUV wave propagated easily through the 
boundary of the coronal hole. In some events, it was found that when an EUV wave 
interacts  with  a  coronal  hole,  the  wave  experiences  reflection  [27,31,48,49]  in 
addition  to  transmission  Olmedo  et  al.  [50].  The  reflection  and  transmission  of  the 
wave at the coronal hole boundary was represented in the simulations of Schmidt and 
Ofman [51]. Their simulations presented a 3-dimensional MHD model to explain the 
EUV  wave  interaction  with  coronal  holes,  which  found  that  the  impact  of  the EUV 
wave  generates  the  resonant  oscillation  of  the  coronal  hole,  and  the  resonant 
oscillation would generate secondary EUV waves. Recently, Piantschitsch et al. [52] 
presented  a  2.5-dimensional  simulation  of  fast-mode  EUV  wave  interaction  with  a 
coronal  hole  and  found  the  EUV  wave  can  transmit  through  the  coronal  hole.  It  is 
noted  that  if  the  fast-mode  wave  speed  changes  rapidly  across  the  boundary  of  a 
coronal hole, it is expected to see both the reflection and transmission of an impinging 
EUV wave.  In our case, however, no reflection  was detected, and only transmission 
was  seen.  Two  possible  reasons  may  account  for  such  a  feature:  One  is  that  the 
impinging fast-mode wave is already too weak, and any reflected wave is too faint to 
be detectable; The other is that the fast-mode wave speed across the boundary of this 
coronal  hole changes  little.  In order to find which reason  is more plausible, we plot 
the distribution of the magnetic field strength at the altitude of 0.1Rʘ along the slice 
S1  in  Figure  5,  where  the  magnetic  field  strength  is  taken  from  the  PFSS 
extrapolation. It is seen that the magnetic field decreases from the source active region 
to the quiet region, but then gradually increases toward the coronal hole near the far 
end  of  the  slice.  Considering  that  the  plasma  density  in  the  coronal  hole  is 
significantly  reduced  compared  to  that  in  quiet  regions,  the  fast-mode  wave  speed 
across the boundary of the coronal hole should increase even more drastically than in 
Figure 5. Therefore, it seems that the first reason is more plausible, i.e., the reflected 
wave is too weak to be detected.

Another interesting feature of this event is that the initial EUV wave was split 
into two fronts in the west direction at a distance of 400ʺ from the source region. The 
initial EUV wave had a speed of 800 ± 12 km s−1, a typical value of the coronal fast-
mode  wave  speed.  Therefore,  it  should  be  a  fast-mode  wave.  Regarding  the  two 
fronts, the faster one  had a speed of only 250 ± 3 km s−1, and the  slower one had a 
speed of 160 ± 2 km s−1. There is no reason for a fast-mode MHD wave to disappear 
suddenly. Therefore, it is speculated that the faster wave with a speed of 250 ± 3 km 
s−1  should  be  a  fast-mode  MHD  wave  as  well.  However,  the  speed  was  decreased 
suddenly  from  800 ± 12  km  s−1  to  250  ± 3  km  s−1,  which  means  that  the  magnetic 
field dropped suddenly at the distance of 400ʺ from the source active region. Figure 4 
also indicates that the  fast-mode EUV wave generated another stationary wave front 
at a distance of 700ʺ from the source active region at 05:27 UT, whereas the slower 
EUV  wave  propagated  out  with  a  speed  of  160  ±  2  km  s−1,  and  then  stopped  at  a 
distance of 500ʺ from the source active region since 05:23 UT. 

In order  to  understand  why  the  fast-mode  speed dropped  suddenly  and  what 
the nature of the slower EUV wave after wave splitting is, we display the extrapolated 
coronal  magnetic  configuration  in  Figure  6,  where  the  blue  lines  correspond  to  the 
magnetic field lines, and the red star marks the  location of the source active region. 
The short green bar indicates the location of EUV wave splitting, and the short yellow 
bar indicates the location where the fast-mode EUV wave generated a stationary wave 
front.  It  is  seen  that  the  wave  splitting  happened  in  front  of  a  magnetic  separatrix. 
According to Chen et al. [40], such a place is a favorite site for mode conversion since 
it  is  above  the  neutral  line  between  opposite  magnetic  polarities.  Therefore,  we  can 
speculate  that  the slower  EUV  wave  after  05:13 UT  was  a  slow-mode  MHD  wave. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
10 

Such a speculation is further supported by two facts, i.e., this slower EUV wave had a 
speed of  ∼160  ± 2  km  s−1,  which  is  the typical  sound  speed  in  the  corona,  and  this 
slower EUV wave stopped since 05:23 UT when it reached the location of a magnetic 
separatrix. These observational features are consistent with the picture of a slow-mode 
MHD  wave  propagating  along  the  magnetic  field  lines  at  the  edge  of  a  magnetic 
separatrix or a QSL.

derived  via  the  potential  field  source  surface  (PFSS)  model.  The  green  bar  indicates  the 
location where a single  wave bifurcated into two  waves at 05:12 UT as indicated by Figure 
4d, and the yellow bar marks the location where the fast-mode outer EUV wave changes to a 
stationary front at 05:27 UT in Figure 4d. The active region is represented by the red star. The 
white  line  is  the  slice  S3  drawn  in  Figure  4a  for  the  time-distance  analysis  of  the  wave 
propagation. 

Figure  6  also  indicates  that  the  stationary  front  generated  by  the  faster  EUV  wave 
corresponds to the location of another magnetic separatrix or QSL, which once again 
is  consistent  with  the  theoretical  model  of  Chen  et  al.  [40],  i.e.,  a  fast-mode  MHD 

 
 
 
 
 
wave  might  be  converted  to  a  slow-mode  MHD  wave  which  then  stops  at  the 
footpoint of a magnetic separatrix or QSL.

One puzzling feature of this EUV wave event is that the fast-mode wave speed 
dropped  drastically  at  a  distance  of  400ʺ  from  the  source  active  region.  From  the 
extrapolated  coronal  magnetic  configuration,  we  can  see  in  Figure  6  that  from  the 
green  bar  to  the  yellow  bar  and  beyond,  the  area  was  covered  by  several  magnetic 
systems  with  alternating  positive  and  negative  magnetic  polarities.  In  such  a  multi-
polarity region, the coronal magnetic field generally decays rapidly with height. This 
is probably why the fast-mode EUV wave was decelerating from 800 ± 12 km s−1 to 
250 ± 3 km s−1 after the distance of 400ʺ from the source active region. We tentatively 
propose a concept of “coronal magnetic holes” to describe this type of area where the 
coronal  magnetic  field  is  significantly  lower  than  surroundings  due  to  its  multi-
polarity  nature.  To  confirm  it,  we  plot  the distribution of  the  coronal  magnetic  field 
strength  at  the  altitude  of  0.1Rʘ  along  the  slice  S3.  Figure  7  indeed  shows  that  the 
magnetic  field  decreases  drastically  from  more  than  6  G  near  the  proximity  of  the 
source  active  region  to  0.2  G  in  the  quiet  region  to  the  west  of  the  source  active 
region,  which  is  much  weaker  than  the  quiet  region  to  the  north.  Such  a  drastic 
deceleration  of  the  fast-mode  EUV  wave  has  not  yet been  shown  by  any  numerical 
simulations  before,  so  it  is  worth  investigating  further  via  MHD  numerical 
simulations. 

It is noticed that along both slices S1 and S3 we did not detect pseudo waves, 
and only along the slice S2 we detected both the fast-mode EUV wave and the pseudo 
wave, and the pseudo wave is due to successive appearance of patchy EUV fronts, as 
discovered  by  Guo  et  al.  [13].  However, different  from  their  explanation,  we  argue 

 
 
 
 
 
12 

that  the  pseudo  wave  with patchy  fronts  can  still be  accommodated  in  the  magnetic 
field line stretching model proposed by Chen et al. [34,35]. 

While  the  fast-mode  wave  and  pseudo-wave  have  completely  different 
formation  mechanisms,  both  of  them  present  anisotropy  on  the  solar  disk.  The 
anisotropy of the fast-mode EUV wave is due to the inhomogeneity of the fast-mode 
wave speed in the corona. The slower pseudo-wave is even more anisotropic, which is 
evident only along the slice S2. According to the magnetic field line stretching model 
proposed by Chen et al. [34,35], pseudo waves propagate only  in the regions where 
the magnetic field lines straddle over the eruption source region.
