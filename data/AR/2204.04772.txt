which show that this web is linearizable when n is odd, or is equivalent to a web by conics when n
is even. We then turn to the abelian relations (ARs) of these webs. After recalling the classical and
well-known case when n = 2 (related to the famous 5-terms functional identity of the dilogarithm),
we focus on the case of the 6-web W0,6. We show that this web is isomorphic to the web formed
P4 and that a kind of ’Abel’s theorem’
by the projective lines contained in Segre’s cubic primal S
allows to describe the ARs of W0,6 by means of the abelian 2-forms on the Fano surface F1(S)
⊂
G1(P4) of lines contained in S. We deduce from this that W 0,6 has maximal rank with all its
AR rational, and that these span a space which is an irreducible S6-module. Then we take up
an approach due to Damiano that we correct in the case when n is odd: it leads to an abstract
description of the space of ARs of W0,n+3 as a Sn+3-representation. In particular, we obtain that

particular AR for W0,n+3 constructed by Damiano from a characteristic class on the grassmannian
of 2-planes in Rn+3 by means of Gelfand-MacPherson theory of polylogarithmic forms. We give an
explicit conjectural formula for the components of En, which involves only rational (resp. rational
and logarithmic) terms for n odd (resp. for n even). By means of direct computations, we prove
that our explicit formulas are indeed correct for n less than or equal to 12.

1. Introduction

We work with analytic objects in the whole paper. The usual setting when studying webs with
regard to their abelian relations and their rank is the complex analytic setting, but some basic
constructions in [Da2] rely on real analytic objects (e.g. real grassmannians, diﬀerential forms on
these) hence both cases will be considered here, but mainly the latter. In most parts, the base ﬁeld
will be R but in some (which will be pointed out), it will be more natural to work over C. In the
sequel, K will stand for one of these two ﬁelds.

In the Introduction, we ﬁrst introduce the topic (webs, abelian relations, etc) before giving a

quick overview of the content of Damiano’s paper [Da2]. We then state our results.

1.1. Curvilinear webs. We introduce basic notions about curvilinear webs. Our presentation
below is very similar to those of [Da1] and [Da2]. For other references on webs (but where the
focus is more on 1-codimensional webs), see the famous ‘Blaschke-Bol book’ [BB] and the more
recent one [PP].

As a ﬁrst example of webs, but which is important for what is to come, let us consider n + 1
points p0, p1, . . . , pn in general position in Pn. Denoting by
pi the linear family of projective
lines passing through pi for i = 0, . . . , n, we get a linear web LW p0,...,pn = (
pn) on
Pn1. By deﬁnition, a quadrilateral web is a (n + 1)-web which is isomorphic to a web of this
kind. Assuming that the pi’s are the vertices e0, . . . , en of the standard n-simplex in Pn, one can
give a simple explicit analytic model for the standard quadrilateral web QW = LWe0,...,en: if

A d-web with d

n + 1 is said to be quadrilateral if all its (n + 1)-subwebs are quadrilateral.
Finally, for a planar 3-web, being quadrilateral can be characterized by the closure of any small
‘hexagonal ﬁgures’ which can be traced on the deﬁnition domain of the considered web by travel-
ing along the leaves of its foliations (see for instance [PP, §1.2]). Hence the term ‘quadrilateral’
never appears when considering planar webs, one uses ‘hexagonal’ instead.

1.1.2. Abelian relations and ranks. An important notion for the study of webs is that of ‘abelian
relation’ (ab. AR). This notion is interesting ﬁrst since it is well-behaved (invariant) modulo
equivalences and also because it is linked to classical objects and results of projective algebraic
geometry.2 In order to recall this notion, given a web W = W(u1, . . . , ud), one denotes by
i , . . . , un

the components of the ﬁrst integral ui for each i. Given k

2The web-theoretic notion of abelian relation is related to that of abelian diﬀerentials and to fundamental results of
algebraic geometry such as Abel’s addition theorem and its converse, etc. See [PP] and the references therein for an
overview on this perspective on web geometry.

In this text, we will essentially deal only with ARs of top degree, i.e. in the case when k = n
1.
Except in other situations in which the complete notation will be used, we will drop the superscript

1 everywhere and just speak of ARs of webs.

−
An important property of ARs (at least of top degree) is that they extend globally but as multi-
valued objects.3 This is of importance when considering webs globally deﬁned on varieties with
non trivial topology, as are those under scrutiny in this paper (see §1.1.5 below). For such a web,
the ARs organize themselves into a local system whose monodromy may be non trivial.

As for many kinds of webs, there are universal bounds on the rank of curvilinear webs. The
following result has been obtained by Damiano, and is of crucial importance considering the
purpose of this paper:4

3The proof of this is standard and is an easy generalization of that in the case of planar webs (cf. [P1, §1.2.2]).

Details are left to the reader.

4This result is only stated in [Da2]. However a detailed proof is given §3.3 in Damiano’s thesis [Da1]. In the case
5, the majoration (1) has been obtained long before by K¨ahler, see S4 in [Bla3].

The case of a quadrilateral web is interesting. When d = n + 1, the RHS of (2) is equal to
2 and since (1) corresponds to a non-trivial AR for QW, it comes that QW has

maximal rank, that is is such that (2) actually is an equality.

1.1.3. Algebraic webs. What makes the relevance of the notion of web of maximal rank is that,
by means of a classical construction relying on basic and very well-known results of algebraic
geometry, one can associate such a web to any plane algebraic curve.

The construction, which goes back to the early developments of web geometry [Bla1], goes

What makes the interest of the notions of abelian relation and rank in the case of planar webs, is
that these allow, in some cases, to prove algebraization results for webs of maximal rank (cf. [PP]
for an extensive exposition from this perspective). But the real interest of all these notions lies
precisely in the fact that there exist planar webs of maximal rank which however do not come
from a plane algebraic curve.

Bol’s web is very particular and it has been known for a long time that it enjoys the following

[ Hexagonality]. Bol’s web is hexagonal and all its 3-terms ARs are logarithmic.
Moreover, the space ARLog(B) that these abelian relations span is 5-dimensional.
[ Maximality of the rank]. Since the 5-terms abelian relation Ab is dilogarithmic, it
does not belong to the space of logarithmic ARs hence Bol’s web has maximal rank 6
and there is a decomposition in direct sum

Bol’s web has been the ﬁrst known example of an exceptional web, that is a web of maximal
rank but which is not equivalent to an algebraic one. Since its discovery in the 1930s by Blaschke
and Bol (see [Bla1, §4] and [Bol]), several new examples of planar exceptional webs have been
discovered (see the sixth chapter of [PP] for a recent overview).

The interest of the notion of ‘exceptional web’ comes from the facts that ﬁrst, such webs exist in
numbers; and second, that one can mimic for them some very classical constructions of algebraic
geometry (canonical map, etc) which ask many interesting questions about the similarity between

plane algebraic curves and planar exceptional webs. This is possibly what motivated several
authors (such as Chern and Griﬃths, cf. [ChG, p. 83]) to qualify as one of the main problems in
web geometry the following one:

(6)

Determine/classify the webs of maximal rank, especially the non-algebraic ones.

Most of the works regarding this problem concerned webs of codimension 1. For curvilinear
webs, we are only aware of old (but quite remarkable) results by Blaschke and Walberer about
skew curvilinear 3-webs regarding their k-ranks [Bla2, BW], and the recent results of Damiano
which we return to in this article.

We note that what might be an ‘algebraic curvilinear web’ has still not been precisely deﬁned,
even if it is known since [BW] that some webs certainly deserve to be characterized as such. We
will shed more light (but just a little) about this later on in the Introduction.

Describing Bol’s web in such a geometric way is interesting since it suggests immediately the

following generalization: for n

ϕi :

M0,n+3 !
consisting in forgetting the i-th point of a conﬁguration of n+3 points on P1, is a surjective rational
map whose ﬁbers are smooth rational curves with n+2 punctures. The corresponding foliations of
dimension 1 satisfy the ‘general position assumption’ of §1.1.1 hence form a curvilinear (n + 3)-
web on

As explained just above, W0,5 is a geometric model for Bol’s web B. The latter being so
important regarding the study of non-linearizable webs of maximal rank, it appears quite natural
to study the whole family of webs W0,n+3’s from the same perspective.

1.2. Damiano’s work. In [GM], Gelfand and MacPherson describe a geometric construction of
some diﬀerential forms on the spaces of projective conﬁgurations in (real) projective spaces from
characteristic classes. Their general construction admits as a particular and very interesting case
(the diﬀerential version of) Abel’s dilogarithmic identity (Ab).

In his thesis [Da1] under the supervision of MacPherson (published in condensed form as the
paper [Da2]), Damiano applies Gelfand-Macpherson’s approach to study the webs W0,n+3’s for
n arbitrary, especially from the point of view of their rank and abelian relations. After having
established several basic results about curvilinear webs such as Proposition 1.1 and studied care-
fully quadrilateral (n + 1)-webs of curves and their abelian relations, Damiano focused on the web
2. We give below a short overview of the very interesting results he got/claims
W0,n+3’s for n
he got about these webs.

He started by noticing that any (n + 1)-subweb W

W0,n+3 given by disregarding only the
i-th and j-th foliations of W0,n+3, is quadrilateral and consequently has rank 1 (according to the
= (n + 3)(n + 2)/2 ARs are
remark just after Proposition 1.1 above). The corresponding
called ‘combinatorial abelian relations’ of W0,n+3 and their span is denoted by ARC
.
This is an a priori quite big subspace of the total space of ARs of W0,n+3 on which the symmetric
(cid:1)
group Sn+3 naturally acts linearly. In the case when n = 2 and up to the equivalence of webs

Next, Damiano applies Gelfand-MacPherson approach to the construction of another AR for
W0,n+3, not a combinatorial one. The geometric starting point is a special case of the Gelfand-
MacPherson correspondence, namely that the moduli space
M0,n+3 identiﬁes naturally with the
G2(Rn+3) of the grassmannian variety of 2-planes in Rn+3
quotient of a certain dense open subset

We describe below in more detail the results obtained (or just conjectured) in this text and how

they are related to the claims (8).

1.3.1. Linearization. First we revisit the linearization problem for W0,n+3 by recalling a nice
and rather simple (but seemingly forgotten) construction and results by Room rediscovered inde-
pendently by Burau more than thirty years later (precise references will be given in §2.2).

The second point of this theorem shows that the second part of assertion (8).1. is wrong when
n is odd (see §2.2.2 below for a description of the main ﬂaw in the arguments advanced in [Da1]
for proving (8).1). We believe that W0,n+3 is indeed non linearizable when n is even but this is
still conjectural.

An interesting feature of the preceding theorem (which was of course stated by Room and by
Burau only in terms of projective algebraic geometry), is that it is constructive: there exists an

The Vn’s together with the associated

two cases n = 2 and n = 3 are very classical and have really been studied a lot: for instance,
V2 is the del Pezzo quintic surface in P5 and W0,5 =
is the web formed by the ﬁve
ﬁbrations by conics on it. The case n = 3 is not less classical than the previous one, and given the

1.3.2. The web
W0,6, its abelian relations and Segre’s cubic primal. What makes the previ-
ous result important for us is that once aware of it, it becomes unavoidable to relate the web-
theoretic questions we are interested in to some very nice and nowadays well-know results about
3-dimensional cubic hypersurfaces. We recall this material below and explain how it is related to
curvilinear webs, referring to §3.1 further for more details and references.

⊂

Let X

P4 be a cubic hypersurface which we assume here to be smooth (essentially for
simplicity). It is known that through a general point x of X pass six pairwise distinct lines included
in X. Since three such lines necessarily span a 3-plane8, the general position assumption of
§1.1.1 is satisﬁed hence these lines are the leaves of a linear 6-web on (a certain Zariski open
subset X0 of) X, denoted by LW X, and which is canonically deﬁned on X. Looking at the
global geometric picture is quite relevant here, and can be better understood by considering the
Fano scheme F = F1(X) of lines contained in X, which is a surface naturally embedded in G1(P4).
First, remark that F is naturally the space of leaves of the foliations composing LW X locally:
X0, one can deﬁne regular germs Li : (X, x0) ! F for i = 1, . . . , 6, such that for any
X suﬃciently close to x0, the Li(x)’s correspond to the six lines contained in X and passing

at any x0 ∈
x
∈
through x. These six (germs of) maps are local ﬁrst integrals for LW X: locally at x0, one has

LW X = W

L1, . . . , L6

.

(cid:16)
In general (for instance when X is non singular), F is a smooth irreducible surface with remarkable
properties some of which allow to describe the ARs of LW X quite nicely. The properties which
will be crucial for our purpose are the following two:

(cid:17)

8This follows easily from Bezout’s theorem.

(ii). for any ω

The second property has to be seen as an analogue, for the incidence between point and lines
included in the hypercubic X, of the classical Abel’s addition theorem for the abelian diﬀerentials
on algebraic curves mentioned in §1.1.3 above. As in the case of any algebraic planar web, one
ﬁrst deduce from (ii) that the following ‘Trace map’

is well-deﬁned. Since it is obviously injective, it follows that the rank of LW X is bigger than
or equal to h0(F, Ω2

n = 3 and d = 6, we deduce that rk

Considering the way a web of the form (LW X) is deﬁned and in view of the preceding result,

it is more than reasonable to say that such webs are ‘algebraic’.9

The preceding proposition shows in particular that, as a linear web, W0,6 = LWS is just a
special element of a family of algebraic webs, which generically are of maximal rank with all
their ARs coming from holomorphic 2-forms on the corresponding Fano surfaces. A natural
question which immediately arises is whether the isomorphism (9) also has a specialization for S.

It is known that many results/constructions concerning smooth hypercubics in P4 generalize
to some singular cubics. In particular, some cases of nodal cubics have been considered by sev-
eral authors, especially the case of 1-nodal cubics threefolds. The case of Segre’s cubic is quite
speciﬁc. For instance, the Fano surface Σ = F1(S) of Segre’s cubic is a rational surface with 21
irreducible components, which is in sharp contrast to the case of the Fano surface of a smooth
hypercubic. We have not been able to localize in the huge existing literature on the subject a place
where the suitable generalization of property (ii) above which could apply to the case of Segre’s
cubic is proved. However, by explicit computations, we have veriﬁed that it is indeed the case,
which implies in particular that AR(W0,6) is isomorphic to the space H0(Σ, ω2
Σ) of global abelian
2-forms on Σ.

Actually, it is easily seen that the isomorphism of complex vector spaces
H0

induced by (9) is an isomorphism of S6-modules, a fact from which interesting consequences can
be deduced. For instance, it is classically known that H0(Σ, ω2
Σ) hence AR(W0,6), is irreducible
as a S6-representation, an observation which immediately appears as contradicting statement 5. in

Theorem E. Let n be any integer bigger than or equal to 2.

1. When n is even, all the claims in (8) hold true.

2. On the other hand, this is not true when n is odd since then the following holds true:

Of course, the ﬁrst part of this theorem is fully due to Damiano. Only the second one (when n
is odd) is new. However, it is fair to mention that it is proved just by adding an elementary (but
new) fact to Damiano’s argumentation.

1.3.4. Explicit formulas for Euler’s abelian relation. We have also investigated more in depth
Euler’s abelian relation En. Here are the main results we have obtained about it, relatively to a

Section §3 is entirely devoted to the case n = 3 which is studied in depth. We start by
discussing in §3.1 the 6-web by projective lines carried by a general cubic hypersurface
in P4. We explain that Proposition C follows from well-known results of Clemens and
Griﬃths about cubic threefolds. The case of Segre’s cubic S is discussed in §3.3. By
means of elementary explicit computations, we prove that, as for smooth cubics, the trace
gives rise to the isomorphism (10) for S as well. From this, we deduce an explicit basis
of AR(W0,6), all the elements of which are rational abelian relations. The structure of
AR(W0,6) as a S6-module is studied in §3.3.5. Theorem D is proved there.
In Section §4, Damiano’s approach for studying AR(W0,n+3) as a Sn+3-module is taken
up in detail. Essentially all the material here is taken from [Da1], the single novelty
being Lemma 4.10. Although its statement as well as its proof are elementary, the second
part of Theorem E follows quite easily from it. We get an explicit basis for the space
ARC

of combinatorial ARs.

Section §5.1 is about Euler’s abelian relation, the construction of which is taken up in
detail. After having given a concise integral formula for the components of En for n
arbitrary in §5.1.4, En, we deduce from some dihedral invariance properties of En two
transformations formulas that its components must satisfy (in §5.1.5). We then turn to the
case when n is odd: in §5.1.8, using the two just mentioned transformation formulas, we
give an explicit rational expression for the components of En, which is conjectural in full
generality but is proved to be the right one for any odd integer n
11. The case when
n is even is considered just after in §5.1.9. We start by dealing with the case n = 4. We
ﬁrst remark that Abel’s method for solving abelian functional equations applies quite well
as well for determining the ARs of any given curvilinear web. Applying this approach,
we are able to give an explicit formula for the components of E4 (cf. (121)), from which
we conjecture a closed formula involving only rational and logarithmic quantities for any
even integer n
2 (see (125)). We prove that this formula is indeed valid for any even
integer n
12.

In the last section §6 of the paper, we formulate some questions that we ﬁnd interesting
about curvilinear webs. Some are in relation to what has been discussed before, others are
not. A few of them concern the study of some projective varieties a better understanding
of which could enlighten us on the abelian relations of the W0,n+3’s when n is odd.

Two appendices have been added at the end:

In Appendix A, we investigate the 1-abelian relations of W0,6 corresponding to the

Finally in Appendix B, we study the web LWC formed by the lines contained in the
so-called ‘chordal cubic’ C
P4. This is a degenerate case in which LWC is a 3-web
(and not a 6-web as in the case of a generic cubic threefold). Using Abel’s method, we
determine the 1-abelian relations of LWC . It turns out that for this speciﬁc example, this
web is equivalent to Blaschke-Walberer web deﬁned on the variety of triangles included
in C . We take the opportunity oﬀered by this coincidence to recall here the very nice
classical but seemingly forgotten results by Blaschke and Walberer about curvilinear 3-
webs in dimension 3 with maximal rank.

2. The moduli spaces

M0,n+3 and the webs
We start by recalling some basic facts about the moduli spaces

W0,n+3 on them
M0,n+3 before describing in sev-
eral ways the webs W0,n+3 on them. In §2.2, we recall Room-Burau’s result and its consequence
(namely Theorem A) for the webs W0,n+3’s. We ﬁnish in §2.2.2 by brieﬂy discussing the ﬂawed
reasoning used in [Da1] to wrongly conclude that none of webs W0,n+3 is linearizable.

All the material presented in this section is fairly standard and well known or well referenced
in the literature. For this reason, no proof is given below, it seemed preferable to give speciﬁc
references instead.

2.1. Basic facts. We start by discussing
M0,n+3 (for n
1 arbitrary) over the ﬁeld of complex
numbers before discussing the web W0,n+3 on it. We end by considering its version over the reals,
this in order to ﬁt better with the setting of [Da2]. Everything in §2.1 is standard and well-known.

We will now give an explicit description of the pull-back of W0,n+3 on Pn under (16), that we
will denote (a bit abusively) using the same notation. First remark that the projection from one of
its points of a degree n RNC in Pn, is a RNC of degree one less (namely n

forgeful map (14) is nothing else but the linear projection πpi : Pn d Pn

−
veriﬁes easily that the leaf of the (n + 3)-th foliation of W0,n+3 on Pn trough a generic point is
precisely the RNC of degree n passing through this point as well as through all the pi’s.

We thus get the following geometric description of the pull-back of W0,n+3 under (16):

(17)

considered on Pn, the web W0,n+3 is formed by the families of lines passing through
one of the pi’s (for i = 1, . . . , n + 2) plus the family of degree n rational normal curves
containing all these points.

From this description of W0,n+3, it is straightforward to verify that in the aﬃne coordinates

(say such

Working with the aﬃne coordinates ui’s, it follows from (18) that Wn+2,n+3 coincides with the
standard quadrilateral web considered in §1.1.2. Hence it has rank equal to 1 (cf. (1)) and since
all the (n + 1)-subwebs of W0,n+3 are equivalent, any of them has rank 1 too: for any i, j with
i < j, Wi, j carries a nontrivial abelian relation, which will de denoted by ARi, j. This AR is unique
up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar (hence there is some ambiguity in its deﬁnition, but that
doesn’t really matter and therefore we will not pay attention to it).

The term ‘combinatorial’ comes from the fact that in their span, the ARi, j’s satisfy relations
of combinatorial nature which give rise to a matroid (see §4.1 and §8.2 in [Da1]). Although this
aspect is interesting, we will not consider it here.

2.1.5. Real locus. While most of the considerations in this paper are within the complex frame-
work (which according to us is most natural), it is the real framework that was considered in both
[Da1] and [Da2]. Working over R requires some subtleties, for instance regarding the domain
on which the webs we are working with are considered, which were not very precisely explicited
according to us. Hence we discuss brieﬂy this aspect below.12 For some recent references, we
mention [Br], [FG, §2.3] as well as the recent preprint [AHL].

The real moduli space

M0,n+3(R) is the set of (n + 3)-tuples (x1, . . . , xn+3) of pairwise distinct
points on the real projective line P1
R (that we identify with a circle S 1), modulo the diagonal action
of PSL2(R). Its is a smooth manifold of dimension n, but with several connected components
M0,n+3(R) is invariant by the action of Sn+3
contrarily to its complex version
discussed in §2.1.2 and this group acts by real-analytic diﬀeomorphisms on it.

on the circle S 1 (with respect to a chosen orientation of S 1, previously ﬁxed once for all). It is a
M0,n+3(R) which is isomorphic to a ball whose topological closure in a
connected component of
certain compactiﬁcation of the full real moduli space, is isomorphic (as a stratiﬁed real-analytic
manifold) to a polytope, the well-known n-th ‘associahedron’ (or ‘Stasheﬀ polytope’).

Being aware of the decomposition (19) makes some of the subtleties arising when studying
the real version of W0,n+3 on
M0,n+3(R) more apparent, which was not suﬃciently discussed
in [Da2] in our opinion.
Indeed, (19) indicates that there is no global web in the real setting

0,n+3 which are globally deﬁned on
the whole deﬁnition domain of this web. Moreover, since this domain is (homeomorphic to ) a
ball, AR(σ) is naturally identiﬁed with the space of ARs of the restriction of W0,n+3 on any open

there is no a priori natural identiﬁcation between AR(σ) and AR(1), it is not clear at all whether

group. To put it brieﬂy, without any supplementary argument, it is not clear how to make Sn+3
act on a space of ARs (eg. AR(1)) in order to get a linear representation of this group.

But the situation has some subtleties even in the complex setting. In this case indeed, the ARs
of W0,n+3 are sections of a local system on
M0,n+3 (cf. page 3). But since its topology is not trivial
and because there is no conﬁgurations invariant by all elements of Sn+3, one cannot straightaway
deﬁne an action of Sn+3 (induced by pull-backs) on a vector space constructed from some ARs
of

M0,n+3.

⋆

Note that, in contrast with the whole space of abelian relations (whether in a real or complex
setting), the situation is quite simpler if one restricts to the subspace of combinatorial ones. In-
deed, since all the components of (1) are rational functions, all the combinatorial abelian relations
ARi, j’s are rational hence Sn+3 naturally acts on ARC(W0,n+3). One veriﬁes easily that this rep-
resentation is deﬁned over Q (but we will not use this arithmetic fact in the sequel).

In the complex setting, a possibly bigger Sn+3-representation (actually obtained from the one
of the previous paragraph by successive extensions), may be obtained by considering the local sys-
tem of ARs of W0,n+3 with unipotent monodromy, denoted by ARU(W0,n+3). The latter comes
with an increasing ﬁltration AR•U(W0,n+3) whose 0-th piece is the vector space ARC(W0,n+3)
and where it is not diﬃcult to ﬁgure how are deﬁned the pieces of higher degree.13 Then one
veriﬁes easily that the associated graded space Grk AR•U(W0,n+3) is a Sn+3-module for any k

Example 3. Let us again consider the web W0,5, but this time within the complex setting (com-

The results above are quite nice generalizations for n even and odd respectively, of some well-
known properties of the del Pezzo quintic surface in P5 (case n = 2) and of Segre’s cubic hyper-
surface S in P4 (case n = 3, discussed in more details §3.3 further). If we will only use the ﬁrst
two points of this proposition in this article, we have mentioned the others to show that the Vn’s
form an interesting family of Fano varieties generalizing very classical examples, which should
be studied further in our opinion. Focusing especially on the case n = 5, we will brieﬂy come
back on this at the end in §6.3.2.

In order to help the reader who might be interested in the statements above, let us indicate
quickly where these can be found in the existing (classical or more recent) literature. First, the
case n = 5 is studied by Room in [R1] by classical projective methods. For n arbitrary, the fact
that ϕn is birational onto its image is not explicitly stated in [R2] or [Bu] but we think that it is
because this fact was more or less obvious to these authors. Another classical reference for the
case when n is odd is [Cob]. For a modern treatment, see Theorem 3.1 (for n odd) and Theorem
3.4 (for all cases) in [K]. Point 2. is rather immediate once it is known that ϕn is birational onto its
image. Regarding the determination of the dimension N as a function of n, see [R2, p. 363], [Bu,
§4.a] and [K, §3.1] for n odd. A formula for N in the case when n is even is a bit more involved
and can be found in [Bu, §4.b] or in [K, §3.3]. The other mentioned statements, namely that Vn
coincides with (P1)n+3//PGL2(C), that Aut(Vn) is naturally isomorphic to Sn+3, or the description
of the singularities, of the Picard group and of the canonical class of Vn, all have been obtained
quite recently, in [BM].

2.2.2. From the ﬁrst two points of Proposition 2.1, one imediately deduces the

The second point contradicts a result claimed by Damiano, namely that W0,n+3 is not lin-
2, which is one of the points stated in Proposition 1.6 of [Da2]. But not
earizable for any n
even an indication of proof appears in the whole paper, except in the classical case n = 2 for
which standard references are given (namely §29, §30 and §31 of [BB]). More details about the
reasoning leading Damiano to state this can be found in his thesis. Since realizing that W0,6
actually is linearizable has been the departure point of the work leading to the present paper, we
believe it is worth explaining precisely where Damiano’s reasoning is not correct according to our
understanding.

Actually, only a few lines are devoted in [Da1] to establish that W0,n+3 is not linearizable for
any n and can be found pages 20 and 21 of Damiano’s dissertation. His reasoning is by reductio
ad absurdum by means of an induction on n and can be decomposed as follows:

1. If W0,n+3 were linearizable, it would admit a model Wn in Rn with linear leaves;

2. Then the (n + 2)-web W′n in H

transverse to one of the foliations (and then disregarding this foliation) would also be
linearizable;

the projection onto a hyperplane H which is considered therein is taken for a model of a quotient
map with respect to a foliation Fi of the linear model Wn of W0,n+3. But for that to be the case, it
is necessary that this foliation be precisely that of lines through a point (possibly at inﬁnity) and it
is not obvious at all that W0,n+3 admits (even locally) a linear model in Rn whose (at least) one of
the foliations enjoys this property. And it turns out that it is not the case for instance when n = 3

We believe that what might have been the source of the mistake discussed in the previous
paragraph is the model (17) of W0,n+3 in Pn: at the exception of the last one, all its foliations
are formed by the lines going through one of the pi’s hence for this model, quotienting by such a
foliation (which in this case makes sense even globally and corresponds to the i-th forgeful map
(14)) is indeed given by the linear projection from the corresponding pi and onto a hyperplane.
But of course, this projection does not linearize the last foliation since the generic leaf of the latter
is a RNC of degree n.

All our remarks above show that, although it is a very appealing approach, one has to be
careful when trying to investigate the webs W0,n+3’s inductively by quotienting along one of its
foliations.

A general idea that emerges from the results of the present article is that the W0,n+3’s seem
to form two distinct classes of webs according to the parity of n, and those belonging to the
same class seem to share most of their properties. For this reason, the validity of the following
conjecture (already mentioned in [Bu]) seems more than plausible:

Conjecture 2.3 (Burau). For any n

≥

2 even, the web W0,n+3 is not linearizable.

That W0,5 is not linearizable is very classical and goes back to the early beginning of web
geometry (cf. [BB, p. 262]). Since then, no progress has been done regarding this conjecture. We
confess having no idea how to handle it, even in the special case n = 4.

Remark 2.4. As we ﬁnished writing this article, we realized that W0,6 is linearizable is explicitly
mentioned in the booklet on webs [Bla4] published by Blaschke in 1955, see the last paragraph
of §54 in it. It is unfortunate that Damiano missed this reference as well as Burau’s paper [Bu].

3. A thorough study of the case n = 3.

Our goal in this section is to study in depth the web W0,6 by showing it can be seen as a par-
ticular case of a quite large class of interesting curvilinear webs coming from algebraic geometry.

We ﬁrst recall below some well-known facts about lines on cubic threefolds and then discuss
how these facts are interpreted in terms of webs. The study of the Fano surface of lines in a cubic
hypersurface X of P4 is a very nice and nowadays classical part of algebraic geometry when X
is smooth. In subsection §3.1 below, we ﬁrst recall some points of this theory and explain their
consequences for web geometry. Most of these results have been extended to the case of singular
cubic hypersurfaces, especially nodal cubics. But as far as we are aware of, only the case of cubics
with only a few nodes (typically one node) has been concretely considered in the literature.14 For
this reason, we discuss in detail the case of Segre’s cubic (which carries 10 nodes, which is the
maximal number of nodes that a hypercubic of P4 can have) in a separate subsection, namely in
§3.3.

3.1. Webs by lines on smooth cubic hypersurfaces of P4. The theory of lines on smooth cubic
threefolds has been considered in many papers. In addition of Fano’s original paper [Fa2], we
mention [Ghe], [BS], [ClG], [T], [Mur] and [AK]. Among these, our main references are [ClG]
and [AK], to which the reader may refer for justiﬁcations of the assertions below.

Here X stands for a smooth cubic hypersurface in P4. The underlying set of its Fano scheme
F1(X), denoted below just by F to simplify, is the subset of the grassmannian variety of lines in
the ambiant P4 formed by the lines contained in X: one has

F = F1(X) =

It is not diﬃcult to exhibit polynomial equations cutting F in aﬃne charts of G1(P4), which shows
that F is naturally an algebraic subvariety of this grassmannian (cf. [AK, (1.14)]). Deﬁning the
associated incidence variety as the algebraic subvariety T =
F,

will have interesting consequences when interpreted in terms of webs:

ii. The Fano variety F is a smooth irreducible surface (see [ClG, Lemma 7.7]). Hence T is
smooth as well. Moreover q makes of T a P1-bundle over F hence T has dimension 3.

iii. Through a general point x of X pass exactly 6 pairwise distinct lines included in X, which
we will denote (with arbitrary labels) by ℓ1(x), . . . , ℓ6(x) (see [AK, (1.7)]). In other terms,
the map p : T ! X in (22) is generically 6 to 1.

iv. The embedding ̺ : F ֒! P9 is canonical: if

about the hypercubic X and its Fano variety F and has been obtained by several authors: originally by Fano (in a rough
form). Modern proofs have been given independently by Clemens-Griﬃths (see [ClG, Corollary 12.38]) and Tyurin.

Proof. The ﬁrst point of 1 is rather obvious: the irreducibility of LW X as a web follows imme-
diately from that of F as an algebraic surface. Regarding the linearizability of LW X, it suﬃces
to consider its local image in P3 by a generic linear projection from a point of P4. As for the
skewness of LW X, it is also easy to establish: assuming that this web is not skew would imply
that through a general point of X passes a doubly-ruled surface Σ included in X. Since Σ is not a
of Eckardt points of X would be inﬁnite), it has to be a quadric surface
plane (otherwise the set

To end the proof of 1, it remains to show that the lines included in X passing through a general
point x, denoted by ℓ1(x), . . . , ℓ6(x), are in general position. To do so, we recall that the tangent
directions at x of the ℓi(x)’s all six belong to the second fundamental form IIX,x of X at the

Then assume that x
X is generic and such that there are three pairwise distinct lines in X
through x which are coplanar. Then their associated tangent directions at this point span a line
in P(TxX), denoted by Lx. Because Lx
IIX,x has cardinality (at least) three, it follows that

contradict (in the case when n = 3) the well-known fact that, given a n-dimensional smooth

The second and third points of the proposition are nothing else but reinterpretations in terms of
(cid:3)

LW X of some the points stated above (mainly the points iv, vi, vii and xv).

Let LW X,x be the germ of LW X at a generic point x

X∗. Using linear projections centered at
suﬃciently generic points of P4, one gets a ﬁve dimensional family of linear models for LW X,x.
It seems more than likely that two such local linear models are generically not projectively equiv-
alent hence that this (germ of) web admits a 4-dimensional family of non projectively equivalent
linearizations. A rigourous proof that it is indeed the case would be welcome.

∈

18A more direct way to conclude may have been to recall that a cubic containing a 2-plane is necessariky singular

(see the paragraph just before Proposition 2.2 in [Do1].

19It is worth mentioning that this ‘well-known fact’ is rather subtle and in any case less obvious than it seems
at ﬁrst sight. For instance, all the considered hypotheses are necessary: there exist complex aﬃne or real projective
hypersurfaces which are smooth but with a degenerate second fundamental form at any point.

In view of Proposition 3.1 and considering to which extent it is very similar to the very classical
corresponding statement holding true for classical ‘algebraic webs’, we believe it is justiﬁed to
say that LW X is ‘algebraic as well’ (see also our discussion in §1.3 of [P3]).

Since the web W0,6 is (birationally) equivalent to the web LWS formed by the six covering
families of lines in Segre’s cubic S and because the latter can be seen as a degeneration of smooth
cubic hypersurfaces, it is natural to wonder whether it is justiﬁed to say that it is an algebraic web
as well. If this is obvious in what concerns its geometric deﬁnition (see §3.3 just below) this is not
as clear with regard to the ARs of LWS since it is not evident that the statements in §3.1.1 used
to obtain Proposition 3.1 admit counterparts for a singular cubic. Indeed, some of these properties
are not satisﬁed by singular cubics, as the ﬁrst example considered in the next subsection shows.

3.2. The case of (some) singular cubics. We ﬁrst discuss the case of a special cubic threefold
with a singular set of dimension 1. Then we say a few words about those cubics with only nodal
singularities. We will focus on the case of Segre’s cubic just after in §3.3.

The hypersurface C is singular along Γ and is the unique cubic threefold of P4 singular along
a rational quartic curve (up to projective equivalence). Note also that C is semistable and that it
appears as a special degenerate point in the GIT moduli space of cubic threefolds (see [Al]). The
chordal cubic is discussed in the paragraphs §44 and §45 of C. Segre’s memoir [Se] and in the
ﬁrst part of the recent paper [Col1], two references the reader interested by more details is invited
to consult.

It is known that the Fano surface F = F1(C ) of lines included in C has two components
denoted by F′ and F′′ : the former F′ is the family of lines which are 2-secant with Γ and the latter
P4 such that the restriction to Γ of the linear projection πℓ : P4 d P2 from
F′′ is the set of lines ℓ
ℓ has a ramiﬁcation divisor of degree 2 on Γ (or equivalently, πℓ(Γ) is a conic). Both F′ and F′′

As a scheme, it can be veriﬁed that F1(C ) contains F′ and F′′ with multiplicity 4 and 1 re-
spectively (cf. the bottom of p. 214 in [Col1]) from which it follows that through a general point
c of C pass exactly three pairwise distinct lines included in C : two lines ℓ′′1 (c) and ℓ′′2 (c) corre-
sponding to two distinct points of F′′ and the 2-secant ℓ′(c) to Γ passing through c, which comes
with multiplicity 4. From this it follows that when smooth cubics degenerate to C , the associated
6-webs by lines degenerate onto a web that it is justiﬁed to denote by LWC but which is a 3-web.

It is not diﬃcult to make LWC explicit. Indeed, from the very deﬁnition of C it follows that

The remarks above indicate which statement corresponds to the ﬁrst point of Proposition 3.1
when the cubic threefold X specializes to the singular one C . The other points of this Proposition
concern abelian relations and clearly everything stated in Proposition 3.1 about 2-ARs does not
admit a counterpart for LWC since it is known that the 2-rank of any curvilinear 3-web in dimen-
sion 3 is zero. This example shows that what has to be the statement corresponding to Proposition
3.1 when the considered cubic is singular is not self-evident.

Even if it is a bit oﬀ topic, it is interesting to consider the 1-ARs of LWC , since it turns out
that this web has maximal 1-rank and that its 1-ARs as well come from the abelian 1-forms on
the Fano surface of C . We will discuss this a little further in Appendix B.

⋆

We have taken time to discuss the case of the chordal cubic C ﬁrst because we ﬁnd it interesting
per se22, but also because it is not self-evident to show how to extend the nice theory discussed
above in §3.1.1 to singular cubics as well as its web-theoretic consequence, namely Proposition
3.1. However we believe that in what concerns the webs associated to cubic threefolds, there is
not much diﬀerence between the smooth case and that of cubics with only ﬁnitely many singular
points. This is brieﬂy discussed in the next subsection before considering more thoroughly the
case of Segre’s cubic in §3.3.

3.2.2. Cubic threefolds with ﬁnitely many singular points. It is known that cubic hypersur-
faces in P4 with only ﬁnitely many singularities share many properties with the smooth cubics,
but may also present some distinct features.

The ﬁrst and perhaps main diﬀerence between smooth and singular cubics is about their ratio-
nality. The smooth cubics are known to be irrational according to a famous result of the ﬁeld (due
to Clemens and Griﬃths [ClG]) 23, contrarily to any singular cubic for which the projection from
one of its singular points induces a birational map from it onto P3. Another example of distinct
feature depending on the singularities a cubic threefold can have, is given by considering the case
of cubics with ﬁnitely many ordinary nodes. Indeed, for such a cubic X, it is known that the
number k of nodes is less than or equal to 10 and that the Fano surface of lines F1(X) is generally
irreducible when k

If classical geometers considered the case of cubic threefolds with arbitrary many ordinary (or
even more involved) nodes24 this is not the case in more recent papers. The results of Hodge-
theoretic nature listed in 3.1.1 were established in view of proving the main result of the ﬁeld,
namely the non rationality of a smooth cubic threefold and therefore were essentially considered

22It is worth mentioning that in [Col1], Collino has used degenerations towards the chordal cubic C in order to

deduce informations about the fundamental group of Fano surfaces of smooth cubic threefolds.

23In several publications circa 1945, Fano claimed having established that a general cubic hypersurface in P4 is not

rational. But his proof does not seem to have been accepted as correct (cf. the discussion in [Pu, §2.1]).

24See for instance Segre’s memoir [Se] (from §12 to §27), Fano’s papers [Fa1] and [Fa2, §9] or Snyder’s article

[Sn], where some of the assertions mentioned above are proved by means of classical geometric methods.

for smooth cubic threefolds. Actually, most of the techniques used by modern authors actually
apply to the so-called ’Lefschetz cubic hypersurfaces’, that is cubics with at most one ordinary
node as singularity. And indeed, in the recent papers where the material of 3.1.1 is discussed in the
case of a singular cubic, only the case of cubic threefolds with one ordinary node has been really
considered (in addition to [ClG]) where the case of Lefschetz cubics of P4 is explicitly considered,
see for instance [CM] or [GK]). Recently, cubic threefolds with more involved singularities
have been considered (for instance in some papers by Allock (2003) or Casalaina-Martin & Laza
(2009)) but with regard to their stability in the aim of studying their moduli theory. In particular,
as far as we know, the theory thoroughly described in 3.1.1 is not discussed in a systematic way
for singular cubics with more than one ordinary node in the existing literature, especially some
points (such as xv. page 26, which has to be seen as a kind of Abel’s theorem within this context)
which are crucial in view of establishing a result similar to Proposition 3.1 for the webs of lines
on singular cubics.

We consider below the case of singular cubics with only ﬁnitely many singular points. We do
not assume that the singular points are ordinary nodes, just that they are isolated. We deduce the
’Abel’s addition result for lines included in such a cubic’ from the corresponding one holding true
for smooth cubics ﬁrst by means of a very natural deformation argument and also by using the
fact that the Fano surfaces of such cubics satisfy properties similar to some listed in §3.1.1 for
smooth cubics (cf. (29)). Our arguments below are rather standard and easy to follow hence we
believe that very likely the ’Abel’s addition result for lines on a cubic threefold with isolated sin-
gularities’ we prove below will appear to the experts as a well-known folkloric generalization of
the corresponding result for smooth cubics, which is classical. Proposition 3.3 and its proof have
been included here not for claiming any kind of originality but just for the sake of completeness.

Abel’s theorem for abelian 2-forms on the Fano surface. Let us set precisely the notation and
P4 stands for a ﬁxed irreducible cubic threefold with
assumptions we will deal with. Here X
ﬁnitely many singularities. We moreover assume that LW X is a well-deﬁned 6-web on X: for
X generic, the six lines ℓ1(x), . . . , ℓ6(x) passing through x and contained in X are pairwise
x
distinct and are in general position, namely any three of them span a hyperplane in the ambiant
P4. Here again F = F1(X) stands for the Fano scheme parametrizing the lines included in X. The
key fact behind the proof of Proposition 3.3 discussed below is the following generalization of
iv. of §3.1.1 to the case of cubic threefolds with isolated singularities. Indeed, according to [AK]
(cf. (1.4), (1.8) and (1.15) therein), although not smooth, F satisﬁes the following properties:

G1(P4) is still a reduced algebraic surface (but with singularities and

As is well-known (see [Bar]), the canonical sheaf ω2

F can be identiﬁed with that of abelian
diﬀerential 2-forms on F, namely the subsheaf of meromorphic 2-forms giving rise to ∂-closed
currents on their deﬁnition domain. In particular, H0(F, ω2
F) can naturally be seen as a subspace

In view of Proposition 3.1, it is natural to wonder whether the statements therein about the
1-forms of the Fano surface/the 1-ARs of the web by lines on the cubic are also veriﬁed when X
has isolated singularities or not. This is more subtle than it is for 2-forms/2-ARs but we think that
it is indeed the case. We will discuss this in the next paragraph.

The key fact behind Proposition 3.3 is the point xv of §3.1.1 which follows from the fact that
when X is smooth, the trace of a global holomorphic 2-form on F1(X) admits a holomorphic ex-
tension to the whole X hence necessarily vanishes. 25 It is not immediately clear in which way
this approach can be extended to singular cubics. For instance, even for a cubic with simple sin-
gularities (nodes) such as Segre’s cubic S, proving a priori that the trace of an abelian diﬀerential
2-form on Σ = F1(S) is abelian seems a bit delicate. We have chosen to follow another approach
to prove the proposition above, which is quite natural since it relies on the smooth case via a local
deformation of the considered cubic.

We continue to use the notations introduced before in the proof below:

LW X,x = LW X0,x0 . 26 From this, we deduce that the germs of maps ℓi,t : (Xt, xt) ! Ft = F1(Xt)

On Abel’s theorem for abelian 1-forms on the Fano surface. We believe that some meaningful
parts of Proposition 3.1 generalize in a straightforward way to any cubic threefold X with isolated
singular points, at least as soon as the lines included in it deﬁne a genuine 6-web on it.27 However,
as is already the case for smooth cubics (cf. [ClG, p. 338]), everything that concerns the links
between some diﬀerential k-forms on the Fano surface F = F1(X) and the k-ARs of LW X is
much more subtle when k = 1 than when k = 2. We discuss below several approaches which
could give a proof of the extension for cubics with isolated singularities of the fact that the ﬁrst
trace map may induce an isomorphism between a space of 1-diﬀerential forms on the associated
Fano surface and the space of 1-ARs of the corresponding web of lines on the cubic. We warn
the reader that nothing is proved below, rigorous investigations on this are left for a hypothetical
future work.

In what follows, X stands for a ﬁxed cubic threefold in P4 with isolated singularities.

X

As a ﬁrst attempt, one might naively want to extend in a straightforward manner the approach
discussed in the preceding paragraph to the case when X has isolated singularities: considering
1(b0) over a smooth 1-dimensional base B, one deﬁnes
a smoothing π :
a coherent sheaf of ‘relative abelian 1-forms’ ω1
/B on the total space of the associated family
F
27Note that for X a smooth cubic with isolated singularities, it may happen that LW X be a genuine 6-web but not
a skew one (this precisely happens for Segre’s cubic S for instance). In such a situation, the space of 1-ARs of LW X
may be of inﬁnite dimension hence one cannot expect the whole Proposition 3.1 to be generalized as it is to the case
of such cubic threefolds.

It seems to us that one might be able to deduce from the (rather technical) Hodge-theoretic
considerations in [Col1] that everything discussed above indeed holds true when considering the
chordal cubic C and its non irreducible hence singular Fano surface F1(C ) (this independently of
the fact that the lines in C do not deﬁne a 6-web in it, but only a 3-web). This makes us conﬁdent
that everything go as sketched above in the simpler case of cubics with only ﬁnitely many singular
points.

Instead of trying to deal with 1-forms on the singular Fano surface F0, one can rather
consider working with the global holomorphic forms on a semi-abelian (hence smooth)
B with Xb smooth, the Albanese
variety naturally associated with it. Indeed, 1. for b
map alb : Fb ! Alb(Fb) induces an isomorphism alb∗ : H0
);
2. an Albanese variety with an associated Albanese map has been constructed by several
authors for cubics with singularities and this construction has been proven to behave well
for suitable degenerating families (see e.g. [Gw1] for cubic with ordinary nodes only,
or [CGHL] and the reference therein for more involved isolated singularities).29. In the
case under scrutiny,
B would be an analytic family of 5-dimensional semi-
abelian varieties from which it should be possible to construct an analytic ﬂat family of
spaces H1
b with the required properties. We believe that such an approach should work for
cubics with ordinary nodes [Gw1] or for those with ‘allowable singularities’ according
to the terminology used in [CGHL].

Finally, as a last possible way to construct the 1-ARs of LW X, we would like to mention the
old and not well-known but very interesting paper [BW]. In it (in §6 more precisely), Blaschke
and Walberer construct quite directly from any cubic homogeneous form deﬁning a given cubic
P4, the 1-ARs not of the web by lines on X but of an associated 3-web, namely
threefold X
the curvilinear 3-web TW X naturally deﬁned on the variety T X of ‘triangles included in X’.30 It
would be interesting to check whether their approach can be adapted to build by hand an explicit
family of dimension 5 of 1-RAs, but for LW X this time. Note that in [BW], essentially no

29Actually, in most papers dealing with singular cubics, what is constructed is a ‘generalized intermediate Jacobian’
J(X0) associated to a suitable singular cubic threefold X0, which is a semi-abelian variety of dimension 5 (actually, the
semi-abelian intermediate Jacobian J(X0) is constructed by relating it to a Prym variety of a non ramiﬁed 2-1 cover of
a plane quintic curve associated (in a non canonical way) to X0, see [CGHL, §3.2]). For a smooth cubic X, there is
a well-understood isomorphism J(X)
Alb(F1(X)) and it is expected (and proved in many cases) that this extends to
singular cubics, or at least to some of them. The fact that most of these constructions for singular cubics are in terms
of ‘intermediate Jacobians’ and not of ‘Albanese varieties’ actually is not important for our purpose.

assumption about the singularities of X are made; it seems to be only required that TW X is a
skew curvilinear 3-web whose leaves are in general position generically. It would be interesting
to revisit [BW] with a modern and rigorous approach, for instance to determine precisely under
which hypothesis the results contained in it hold true.

3.3. Segre’s cubic (case n = 3). We now focus on the case of Segre’s cubic. Since it is a
very well-known and studied threefold, no proof of its properties stated below will be given, the
interested reader will refer to the speciﬁc references indicated in the following subsection.

3.3.1. References. Segre’s cubic has been discussed in many papers since its discovery by Segre
in 1887. As classical references, in addition to Segre’s original paper [Se] (§24 to §27 therein),
one can mention §19 to §31 in ‘Capitolo 8o’ of Bertini’s book [B], [Sn], [SR, Chap. VIII, §2.32].
As for other recent references, the following ones are interesting considering our purpose but there
may exist many others we are not aware of: Segre’s cubic primal is discussed in several papers by
Dolgachev, such as [Do1] (in particular §2 and §4 therein) or [Do2, §5]. Other modern references
are: [Hu, §3.2], [Gw1, Gw2], [Col1], [Col2] and [DFL, §2]. Among the previous references,
[Col2] is perhaps the most relevant one since Collino describes there the Fano surface of lines
of Segre’s cubic quite explicitly and studies some of its features. It is unfortunate that such an
interesting text has not be published in proper form.

3.3.2. Segre’s cubic. We recall well-known classical facts about Segre’s cubic.

First, we introduce some notation: Let [U1, U2, U3, U4] be some ﬁxed homogeneous coordi-
nates on P3 and x, y, z stand for the aﬃne coordinates on C3 = P3
corresponding to the
embedding (x, y, z) 7! [x : y : z : 1]. As above, the pi’s (for i = 1, . . . , 5) stand for the following
points in P3: pi = [δi

In what follows, whitout any supplementary precision, i, j, k, l, m will stand for pairwise distinct
). For such indices, we denote by

Hence the pi j’s are 10 pairwise distinct singular points of V3. On another hand, the map ϕ3 has
rank 3 outside the union of the 10 lines Li j’s, hence V3 is smooth outside the pi j’s. Because these
singular points all are ordinary nodes (as an easy analysis shows), one deduces that V3 coincides
with Segre’s 10-nodal cubic hypersurface. For that reason, we will denote this threefold by S from
now on. We will write NS =

and of its Fano surfaces. In order to describe the incidence relations between the 21 components
of Σ, it is much more convenient to use Collino’s notations L[(i j), (kl)] (recalled above) for the
lines joigning two nodes of S. Then the intersections between the diﬀerent components of Σ can

An elementary and explicit proof of Proposition 3.8. The key fact behind the elementary ef-
fective approach discussed below is point 2. in (29), namely that the dualizing sheaf ω2
F of the
Fano surface F of a cubic threefold X with ﬁnitely many ordinary singular points coincides with
G1(P4) ֒! P9. Since the dualizing
the pull-back of
sheaf ωF naturally identiﬁes with the sheaf ω2
F of abelian diﬀerential 2-forms on F (cf. [Bar]),
the aforementioned fact allows to get explicit expressions for a basis of H0(F, ω2
F) as soon as the
embedding F ֒! P9 is explicitly known. One is reduced to verify whether the elements of this
basis give rise to abelian relations for the associated linear web LW X, which can be done through
direct computations. In the sequel, we apply this approach to Segre’s cubic S in order to describe
LWS.

Realizing that all the ARs of W0,6 were rational in some natural coordinates led us to doubt
about the validity of the decomposition (8) of AR(W0,6) as a S6-module claimed in [Da2]. In
order to clear this up, we have investigated the birational action of S6 on the ARs (38) to come to
the conclusion that there was indeed an error on this point.

those used in the preceding subsection. Here x, y, z stand for the rational coordinates correspond-
ing to the map C3 d M0,6, (x, y, z) 7! [
, 0, 1, x, y, z]. The ﬁrst integrals we work with here
for W0,6 are the six rational ﬁrst integrals Ui = (ui, vi) : C3 d C2 of the previous subsection,
with the only diﬀerence that we have exchanged U1 and U3 (namely, one takes U1 = (x, y) and
U3 = (y, z) below while the others Ui’s are left unchanged).

As it can easily be veriﬁed, each row of the matrix page 45, denoted by MAR in what follows,
encodes an abelian relation ARi j (where therefore i and j correspond to the zero coeﬃcients):
denoting by mab (for a and b ranging from 1 to 10 and 6 respectively) its coeﬃcients, then mab is
a function of Ub for any b (hence one can write mab = mab(Ub)) and for any a = 1, . . . , 10, the
following relation

10
b=1 mab(Ub) Ωb = 0 holds true identically.

P

One denotes by AR(a) the combinatorial AR corresponding to the previous relation (hence
AR(1) = AR13, . . ., AR(10) = AR56). By elementary linear algebra, one veriﬁes that the AR(a)’s
for a = 1, . . . , 10 are linearly independent abelian relations, from which we get the

Proposition 3.10. 1. The space ARC(W0,6) has dimension 10.

2. Consequently AR(W0,6) = ARC(W0,6) and W0,6 has maximal rank.

We remark that the ﬁve combinatorial abelian relations ARi j which do not correspond to one of
the lines of MAR correspond to the pairs (12), (23), (36), (46) and (45) hence one deduces a more
invariant way to describe the basis of AR(

L. PIRIO

From the explicit expression for T and C above and considering basic facts of the linear repre-
-sentation theory of S6, it is not diﬃcult to recognize to which representation ρ corresponds. First,
elementary computations show that T and C do not have any eigenvector in common. Hence if the
representation under scrutiny is not irreducible, then it is necessarily the sum of two irreducible
S6-modules both of dimension 5. Under this assumption, looking at the character table of the
S6-representations, one deduces from Tr(C) =
1 that the representation is the direct sum of the
standard representation with another representation with Young diagram either [32] or [23].

−

In these cases, the trace of the matrix corresponding to a transposition would be 3

1 = 2 and
2. This implies that the representation
2, one deduces that it is the third exterior power of the standard

3 + 1 = 4 respectively, which would contradict Tr(T ) =
ρ is irreducible. From Tr(T ) =
representation of S6. We have proved the
Proposition 3.13. As a S6-module, the 10-dimensional space ARC(W0,6) = AR(W0,6) is irre-
ducible with associated Young diagram [313].

−

−

−

Proposition 3.10 and the one just above contradict some of the claims in [Da2]. The ﬁrst
thing one may think of for explaining this would be that there is a problem with the construction
given by Damiano of Euler’s abelian relation E3 and that this AR actually does not exist. It turns
out that this is not the case, Damiano’s construction of Euler’s abelian relation is valid for any
n
2: we will discuss this in depth in Section §5.1. According to us, he problem lies in the fact
that, unaware of the dichotomy according to the parity of n in what concerns the properties of
web W0,n+3, Damiano missed an elementary but crucial fact when he studied the Sn+3-module
W0,n+3
structure of the space of combinatorial abelian relations AR
. It is what we are going to
discuss in the next section.

4. The space of combinatorial abelian relations as a Sn+3-representation

We would like to get a better understanding of the space of combinatorial ARs of W0,n+3.
Damiano used a powerful combinatorial and representation theoretic approach to do so. Using it,
he obtained very interesting and almost complete results about the structure of AR(W0,n+3) as a
Sn+3-module. However, since he was not aware of the dichotomy between the cases when n is
even or odd in what concerns the Sn-module structure of AR
, he did not go all the way
and missed a complete description of it. On another hand, the proofs in Damiano’s article [Da2]
(cid:1)
(cid:0)
are very concise and/or a bit elliptical in some places. More details are given in his thesis [Da1]
but this one is less easily available. For these reasons and especially for the sake of completeness,
we thought it relevant to take up Damiano’s approach with as much details as possible and it is
the purpose of the current section.

W0,n+3

Most of the material below, the statements as the proofs, are due to Damiano and are taken with
essentially no change either from the fourth chapter of Damiano’s thesis [Da1] or from Section
§3 of the corresponding paper [Da2]. We only have added a few details in some places. Proofs
have been included below mainly for the sake of completeness but also because these results
are particularly important regarding the main purpose of this text and are quite nice, as well as
their proofs. The unique genuine novelty in this section is Lemma 4.10 which together with
Damiano’s result and although it is elementary, allows us to show that actually all ARs of W0,n+3
are combinatorial when n is odd.

The plan of the sequel is as follows: after having introduced some notations in §4.1, we state
Theorem 4.2 which is the main result of this section. Proofs are given in the following subsections
§4.3 and §4.4. Finally in §4.5, we discuss explicit formulas for the components of the combina-
torial ARs of W0,n+3, which will be used later on to make explicit the components of Euler’s
abelian relation in Section §5 (see Proposition 5.22 more speciﬁcally).

which describes AR(W0,n+3) as a Sn+3-module. This result contradicts, when n is odd, one of
the main results claimed by Damiano. However the proof, whether n is odd or not, is essentially
Damiano’s one! The single novelties here are the few details we have added and also a ﬁnal

when n is odd.

We now turn to the proof of the preceding proposition. The one below is entirely taken from

will describe (without proof) a more geometric approach of Proposition 4.3 which is much more
in the spirit of classical web geometry.

Proof of Proposition 4.3. It suﬃces to prove the proposition for i = n+3. To simplify the notation,
W[n+3
we set A = A(n + 3) = AR
and AC = AC(n + 3) = ARC
. For l = 1, . . . , n + 2, we
denote by ql the point of P(A) corresponding to ARl,n+3. By deﬁnition, P(AC) is the subspace of

L. PIRIO

P(J) = P(J). On the other hand, σi exchanges qi with
to the deﬁnition of J, we have that σi
q j1 hence we get that qi belongs to P(J). Because this applies to any i not in J, we obtain that
P(J) = P(AC). Assume that κ < n
J distinct. On the
one hand, the permutation (i, i′) lets q j invariant for all j
J. Since these points are in general
position in P(J), it follows that (i, i′) acts as the identity on this space. On the other hand, (i, i′)
exchanges qi and qi′, which is a contradiction. Thus necessarily, one has κ = n

We thus have proved 1. The second point follows immediately.

Let us turn to the structure of the space A as a Sn+2-module. Picking a projective basis for
P(A), say the (n + 1)-tuple (q1, . . . , qn+1), we identify it with Pn. From the arguments above, it
follows that the image of Sn+2 in PGLn+1(C) corresponding to this identiﬁcation can be described
n+1
qi
as the set of projective transformations leaving
i=1 invariant and inducing a permutation of it.
{
From this, one gets easily that A[n+3 necessarily is an irreducible Sn+2-representation. Since more-
over it has dimension n + 1, there are only two possibilities: either it is the standard representation
or its dual (with respective Young symbols [n + 1, 1] and [2, 1n]).

}

From above, we know that the abelian relations AR1,n+3 for i = 1, . . . , n + 1 form a basis of
A = AC which has dimension n + 1. In order to recognize it as a Sn+2-representation, we consider
the matrix in this basis of the linear involution associated to the transposition (1, 2), denoted by
AR j,n+3 for any j = 3, . . . , n + 1 on the
AR j,n+3 =
M(1,2). From Lemma 4.4, we have (1, 2)
=
one hand, whereas one has (1, 2)
1, 2

{

on the other hand. It follows that Tr

Sn+2 where
χ[n+1,1] of the standard representation is such that χ[n+1,1](σ) =

is not the standard representation but its dual, which concludes the proof of the proposition.

4.3.1. An alternative view on Proposition 4.3. Here we would like to explain another way to
establish Proposition 4.3 much more in the spirit of classical web geometry and which suggests
an interesting possible development (see §6.2 further). This approach is a rather straightforward
generalization for curvilinear (n + 2)-web in dimension n of the classical linearization/algebraiza-
tion of maximal rank planar 4-webs which goes back to works by Lie, Poincar´e and Blaschke (for
which we refer to [PP, §4.3]).

We denote by V the complex vector space Cn+1 the projectivization of which is the ambiant
projective space Pn we are working in: Pn = P(V). If v1, . . . , vn+1 ∈
V stand for the vectors of the
canonical basis of V and vn+2 = (1, . . . , 1)
V, the. one has pi = [vi] for i = 1, . . . , n + 2 where
! Pn stands for the standard projectivization map. We denote by P the set of the pi’s
] : V
[
·
and by LW P the (n + 2)-linear web on Pn formed by the families of lines through the pi’s. It is
nothing else but the subweb W[n+3 of W0,n+3.

In addition to giving a more conceptual explanation for Proposition 4.3.3, the material dis-

•

One may think that the construction of canonical maps and of a canonical geometric
model considered above for LW P could be generalized to any (n + 2)-web in dimension
n with maximal (n
1)-rank. This suggests a possible approach for algebraizing such
webs. We will say a few words about this problem further in §6.2.

Another interesting question that emerges from the above considerations concerns the
Pn, let C p be the rational normal curve in Pn
varieties Zn. Given a generic point p
passing through all the pi’s and p. Denoting by Lp the (embedded) tangent line to C p at
p, one gets a rational map L : Pn d G1(Pn), p 7−! Lp whose image Zn = L (Pn) is
a n-dimensional submanifold of the grassmannian variety of lines in Pn. For n = 3 and

4.4. Proof of Theorem 4.2. This subsection is devoted to proving Theorem 4.2. We have repro-
duced Damiano’s arguments for completeness, with only minor modiﬁcations added in order to
make them clearer. Our only signiﬁcant (although elementary) contribution is Lemma 4.10 which
deﬁnitively settles the case when n is odd.

We start with two technical lemmata taken from [Da1, §4]. To state the ﬁrst, one considers
n + 2 points q1, . . . , qn+2 in general position in Pn together with an irreducible linear Sn+2-action
on this projective space which induces the natural action by permutations on the qi’s (i.e. one has

(cid:11)

Proof. By induction on m, one can restrict oneself to only deal with the case when m = n + 1.

Let V be the Sn+2-module of dimension n + 1 whose projectivization is the considered Sn+2-
action on Pn. Since V is irreducible and has dimension n+1, its Young symbol λ is either [n+1, 1]
or [2, 1n]. It then follows immediately from the branching rule (see [Sag, Theorem 2.8.3]) that
the restriction V #Sn+1 is the sum of two irreducible Sn+1-representations, one with Young symbol
λ
, the other of dimension 1 denoted by W. Since qn+2 is ﬁxed by

From the second point of Corollary 4.8, it follows that this relation is necessarily unique.

On the other hand, for any (k, l) with k = 1, . . . , n and l = k + 1, . . . , n + 1, it follows from
Lemma 4.4 that (k, l)
1 is
even). Applying (k, l) to (57) would give another such identity if ck,l were not zero, and this is
not possible by the argument given just above. We thus get that all the constants ci, j are zero for

and such a relation does not exist since, as it follows from the ﬁrst point of Proposition 4.3, the
combinatorial ARs appearing in it form a free family. Thus there is no identity of the form (57),
(cid:3)
which gives us the lemma.

With the previous results at hand, it is then easy to establish Theorem 4.2:

Proof of Theorem 4.2. When n is odd, it follows from Lemma 4.10 that the integer η deﬁned in
(56) is equal to n + 1. Hence ARC
has dimension (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 from which it follows
that W0,n+3 has maximal rank with all its ARs combinatorial. Then Corollary 4.9.2 allows us to
conclude.

To prove the theorem in case when n is even, it suﬃces to prove that η = n, which would follow
from exhibiting a non trivial abelian relation which is not combinatorial. We will show that the
(cid:3)
so-called Euler’s abelian relation does the job, hence the theorem follows.

4.5. Leaving aside the question of the structure of ARC(W0,n+3) as a Sn+3-module, it is not
diﬃcult to describe another rather eﬃcient computational approach for building the combinatorial
abelian relations. To this end, we ﬁrst need to set some notation which will be also be used later
on.

59

Given x = (x1, . . . , xn), we use the shorthand x′ = (x2, . . . , xn) = U1(x); we introduce two new
but ﬁxed variables xn+1 = 0 and xn+2 = 1; we set ˜x = (x1, . . . , xn, xn+1, xn+2); and for i, j such that
ı  = (xs)n+2
i = 1, . . . , n+1 and j = i+1, . . . , n+2, we set ˜x
s=1,s,i, j. We allow ourselves to combine all
these notation: for instance, for i, j as above ˜x′
ı  stands for the (n
1)-tuple obtained by removing
b
the ﬁrst, the ith and the j-th entries to ˜x. Since we will always deal with pairs of indices (i, j) with
n, there will be no ambiguity with this notation in what follows. We denote by Bn the set

The interest of this result is threefold: ﬁrst and of course, we conjecture that it holds true in full

5. On Euler’s abelian relation.

61

In this section, we discuss Euler’s AR. Since every AR of W0,n+3 is combinatorial hence
rational when n is odd, it is certain that there is something wrong in Damiano’s claims (8) about
this particular abelian relation for this parity of n. In order to make everything as clear as possible,
in this section we present a thorough study of this AR and before that, of its construction.

Following Damiano but giving more details, we ﬁrst describe the construction of a new abelian
relation En for W0,n+3 using Gelfand-MacPherson’s theory applied to a characteristic class on the
2 (Rn+3) of oriented 2-planes in Rn+3. In §5.1.4, we give a rather
oriented Grassmannian variety Gor
concise integral formula for the components of En which we use to determine the fourth-order
jet of E3 at a speciﬁc point. Then in §5.1.5, we discuss some invariance properties satisﬁed by
2 (Rn+3) (its
En for a certain dihedral action preserving a particular connected component of Gor
2 (Rn+3)>0) and explain how two non trivial functional identities satisﬁed by the
positive part Gor
components of En can be deduced from them.

After having completely explicited E3 in §5.1.6, we turn to the invariant properties of En with
respect to the birational action of the whole symmetric group Sn+3 on
M0,n+3 in §5.1.7. We show
that things actually are more subtile than as described by Damiano, the main and crucial fact
being that, contrarily to the case when n is even, when n is odd Euler’s abelian relation is actually
not canonically deﬁned on each connected component of
M0,n+3, but only up to sign. We explain
that this fact, that does not seem really signiﬁcant at ﬁrst glance, actually has the consequence
that Damiano’s construction of a 1-dimensional Sn+3-representation associated to Euler’s abelian
relation is irremediably ﬂawed when n is odd.

Finally, in §5.1.8 and §5.1.9, which concern the cases when n is odd and even respectively,
we give two closed formulas for the components of Euler’s abelian relation. Both formulas are
conjectural in full generality but are proven to hold true indeed for n less than or equal to 12 (by
means of formal computations).

5.1. On Gelfand-MacPherson’s theory of generalized dilogarithm forms. Euler’s abelian re-
lation is discussed in [Da2, §5] (see also [Da1, Chap. 6]). Its construction relies on the general
theory of ’generalized dilogarithm forms’ exposed in [GM]. Gelfand and MacPherson worked
with usual grassmannian varieties GN(RN+M) whereas Damiano’s chose to do so with oriented
N (RN+M), moreover in the speciﬁc case when N = 2 and M = n + 1. In order
grassmannians Gor
to show more clearly where the problem in Damiano’s construction of a polylogarithmic AR for
W0,n+3 lies, we give below an overview of the corresponding constructions. For proofs, we refer
the reader to the two previously cited articles.

In ordre to consider both cases together, namely the standard and the oriented grassman-
5.1.1.
nians and associated conﬁguration spaces, we agree that

the former notation referring of course to the standard case and the latter to the oriented one.

5.1.2. Euler’s diﬀerential form. When n is even, one could work with usual grassmannians of
2-planes, which are precisely the manifolds used by Gelfand and MacPherson to develop their
theory of higher polylogarithmic forms and of the diﬀerential relations they satisfy. However
this is not possible when n is odd (see Remark 5.19 below for an explanation of this) and it is
then necessary to work at the level of the oriented grassmannian. In order to give a presentation
independent of the parity of n, we will place ourselves within this ‘oriented framework’.

already been described by Damiano in [Da2, §6] (more details are given in [Da1, §6]). But it
is not quite explicit and the author was able to use it only in the case when n = 2, recovering
the well-known Rogers’ dilogarithm. Our goal below is to go a bit further by describing a slight
simpliﬁcation of Damiano’s integration scheme, which gives rise to a more explicit integral for-
1 that we will use to get eﬀective informations about en

locate a classical reference for this formula in the case of real grassmannians.

we will not give a proof of this.

normalize any other coordinate with essentially no change.

The interest of (84) lies in the fact that it is an explicit and closed formula. This oﬀers a way to
study Euler’s abelian relation more concretely. We use this formula below to describe explicitly
Gelfand-MacPherson’s computation leading to Rogers dilogarithm in the case n = 2. Then we
discuss the case when n = 3 and give the ﬁrst terms of the Taylor series of e2 that can be computed
from (84).

not been successful and it might be the case that this is something diﬃcult. However, again by

Albeit rather elementary, this result is of crucial importance regarding the birational action of

be veriﬁed easily (using one of the two formulas (5.11) or (5.14) for instance) this is not the case:
there is no non arbitrary way to distinguish one from the other. As we will see below, this has
non trivial consequences regarding the invariance properties satisﬁed (or not) by Euler’s abelian
or,>
0,n+3(R). Note however that in spite of this, it does not make null and void some
relation on
invariance results stated in §5.1.5 (namely Proposition 5.11 and Proposition 5.15) when n is odd:
it would just be necessary to make the statements of these propositions more precise in this case,
which is easy to do and is left to the reader.

M

85

It can be generalized to any component of it: for any σ

Secondly, the construction above is in no way speciﬁc to the positive component of

M0,n+3(R).
Kn+3, we construct an Eulerian AR on
(σ) (of the web W0,n+3) which is well-deﬁned, but only up to sign when n is odd. In any case,
M
we denote by Eσ
n this (when n is even) or one of these two (when n is odd) abelian relations, the
choice of Eσ
n instead of its opposite being arbitrary when n is odd. The span
is a well-deﬁned
1-dimensional vector subspace of the space AR(σ) of abelian relations of the web W σ
0,n+3. Since
the permutations in Sn+3 induce isomorphisms between the AR(σ)’s and because these spaces
are pairwise non-identical, it is necessary to have a ﬁxed way to identify them all to one of them,
, by means of ﬁxed isomorphisms Ξσ : AR(σ) ! AR(1), one for each
say AR(1) = AR
σ.

Of course, it is natural to assume that these isomorphisms satisfy the following properties:
ﬁrst, one should have Ξ1 = Id. Secondly, since the space ARR
of rational ARs of
W0,n+3 (on the whole moduli space
M0,n+3) naturally
embeds into AR(σ) for any σ, a natural property that the isomorphisms Ξσ must all satisfy is that
they coincide with the identity when taking their restriction along ARR
. Finally, if one
expects the Euler ARs to give rise to a 1-dimensional representation, then each Ξσ(Eσ
n ) must be a

non trivial multiple of E>0

for any σ (which makes sense even in the case when n is odd).

(cid:0)

To summarize, in order that the action of Sn+3 on the space(s) of abelian relations of the web(s)
under scrutiny give rise to a representation with the expected properties, it is necessary that the
Ξσ’s satisfy the following properties:

We are going to going to consider the two cases according to the parity of n separately, this

be the case when n is odd (which we prove explicitly when n is equal to 3)

Case when n is even. When n is even, essentially all the results claimed in [Da2] are indeed satis-
ﬁed. Actually in this case, it is not necessary to work with oriented grassmannians but everything
can be obtained within the (let say) ‘classical’ Gelfand-MacPherson theory developed in [GM].
For this reason, the treatment below of the case when n is even is rather concise.

therein). Then from [GM, §1.3.2], one constructs the abelian relation Eσ
n for any σ, which is
M0,n+3(Rn+3). This explains more conceptually the
well-deﬁned on any component

But the results of [GM] can also be used to investigate the invariant properties of the Euler
ARs. Contrarily to when dealing with oriented grassmammians, in which case the choices of lifts
G2(Rn+3)
of permutations can be a bit subtle, here we will only consider the naive lifts ˜σ

of the grassmannian induced by the linear map Rn+3 ! Rn+3, (xi)n+3

(cid:0)
by ˜σ. It is well-known that the latter is an orthogonal transformation. On the other hand, it is
proved in [GM, Corollary 3.25] that the 4-form P1 on G2(Rn+3) not only is left invariant under
the action of SOn+3(R), but also under that of the full orthogonal group On+3(R). Thus one has
1 for any permutation σ. On the other hand, in the case when σ
˜σ
is a transposition, one veriﬁes easily that ˜σ reverses the natural orientation of the H0-orbits.

The ﬁrst point of this proposition answers question (78).ii. when n is even.

Remark 5.19. 1. When n is odd, one cannot do as above and get an (n
1)-abelian relation for
W0,n+3 using the standard Gelfand-MacPherson theory applied to an invariant 2n-form on the
usual (i.e. non oriented) grassmannian G2(Rn+3). As explained above, when n is even one can
construct Euler’s AR by considering the (n/2)-wedge power of an invariant representative of the
ﬁrst Pontryagin class. This is not possible when n is odd: in this case, 2n is not a multiple of 4
hence one really has to work with an invariant 2-form at some point. And if n = 2m + 1, the thing
is that there is no such invariant 2-form on G2(Rn+3) as it follows from the well known description

2. From (112) and (113), it follows that as an R-algebra, the cohomology ring of Gor

generated by e when n is odd, and by e and e but not by e alone when n is odd (cf. the remark
in [GMZ, p. 267]). This shows that the claim that ‘the real cohomology ring of Gor

2
generated by the Euler class’ p. 1341 of [Da2] is incorrect when n is odd. However, this is
irrelevant in what concerns the validity of the proof of [Da2, Theorem 5.1] given in the sixth
section of [Da2]: since its degree is n + 1, the class e does not belong to the set of characteristic
classes considered in the statement of this theorem and because its square is non zero and has
2 (Rn+3)
degree 2n + 2 = dim
, it is a non trivial multiple of the (n + 1)-th wedge power of e.
This remark, which is missing in [Da2, §6] from our point of view, shows that no case has been

M0,n+3(C), we have constructed in Example 3 (via a method dif-
on the complex moduli space
ferent from that discussed just above) a complex S5-representation on the complexiﬁcation of
AR

This might seem a bit surprising at ﬁrst sight, a natural (but naive) guess would be that (116)
coincides with the complexiﬁcation of the real Sn+3-representation (115). But this cannot be the
case since the 1-dimensional component of the former would be the trivial representation, whereas
that of the latter is the signature representation. Here is a (not fully rigorous) explanation of this
apparent inconsistency: focusing only on the components of dimension 1, one can say that (115)
is obtained by comparing the Euler’s abelian relations E>0

5.1.9. An explicit formula for Euler’s abelian relation when n is even. If the results of §5.1.7
(especially Corollary 5.20) give a clear picture of AR
as a vector space (and even as a
Sn+3-module) when n is even, they have the defect of not being explicit. However, as in the case
(cid:0)
when n is odd (cf. the proposition just above), it is possible to make (the components of) Euler’s
abelian relation explicit when n is odd as well, at least for small values of n (we give a conjectural

The case n = 4 via Abel’s method. It is now well-known that Abel’s method for solving func-
tional equations, by means of successive diﬀerentiations and eliminations in order to get a (par-
tial) diﬀerential equation eventually, gives rise to a powerful and eﬃcient method to determine
the abelian relations of 1-codimensional webs.45 Facing the problem of making the components
of E>0
4 explicit, we have realised that it could be handled by adapting Abel’s method again. Since
it could be useful in dealing with other (curvilinear) webs, we say below a few words on how
Abel’s method works in the case under scrutiny.

We work on C4 and x1, . . . , x4 stand for the standard variables on it. We denote by ∂x1, . . . , ∂x4
the associated constant vector ﬁelds. The ﬁrst integrals we are going to work with are the
U1, . . . , U7 given in (44), and Ω1, . . . , Ω7 stand for the corresponding normals (see (45)). Our
goal is to apply an appropriate adaptation of Abel’s method to determine, for all i, the general
form of the functions ei of three variables appearing in the following identity:

(119)

7

Xi=1

ei(Ui) Ωi = 0 .

Thanks to the action of the cyclic map C deﬁned in (46), just dealing with e1 is enough.

For s = 1, 2, 3 and any i, we denote by δs(ei) the partial derivative of ei with respect to the s-th

variable and we also consider the following rational vector ﬁelds on C4:

Xi = ∂xi

(i = 1, . . . , 4) , X5 =

−

1) ∂xi , X6 =

Xi=1

and

X7 =

Xi=1

xi(xi

−

1) ∂xi .

Each Xi deﬁnes the foliation which admits Ui as a primitive ﬁrst integral. Consequently one
has identically Xi(Ui) = 0 whereas for i , j, Xi(U j) , 0 holds true (generically) thanks to the
transversality of the leaves of the foliations of W0,7.

One has Ωi =

k,idxk for i = 1, . . . , 4 hence (Ωi)4

i=1 is a (essentially the canonical) basis of
∧
Ω4(C4). Setting ωi = Ωi(∂x2, ∂x3, ∂x4
for i = 1, . . . , 7, and considering only the Ω1 components
of each term of the sum in (119), we deduce that the following functional identity with scalar
coeﬃcients holds true

(cid:1)

(120)

e1(U1) + e5(U5) ω5 + e6(U6) ω6 + e7(U7) ω7 = 0 .

Dividing (120) by ω1

7 and applying X7 makes e7(U7) disappear and gives us the following

‘partial functional-diﬀerential equation’:

Actually, changing the order in which the terms involving the ei’s for i , 1 (and their partial
derivatives) are eliminated gives rise to other partial diﬀerential equations. What we get at the
end is an explicit system of partial diﬀerential equations, which we denote (Se1) (it is formed by
several PDE’s similar to the one above and there is no point in making it explicit here). Contrarily
to so many similar computations we did in the past to determine the ARs of given planar webs,
we have not been able to solve (Se1) using a computer algebra system without making additional
assumptions. Looking for solutions of a certain kind46, we have been able to ﬁnd one of these in

It is worth noticing that the results of this paragraph share great similarities with some in [P4,
§6.2.3]. Finally, let us mention that another approach to build a basis of the space of rational ARs
of W0,n+3 from Euler’s abelian relation might be to use the ‘monodromy method’49 which relies
on the fact that the complexiﬁcation of E>0
n has unipotent monodromy on the complex moduli
space

M0,n+3(C). We shall not pursue on this here.

49We are referring here to the generalization for curvilinear webs of the method discussed in [P4, §6.2.3.2].

6. Additional problems

97

Many problems and conjectures have been stated previously in this text, most of them in di-
rect relation with the webs under scrutiny here, namely the curvilinear webs W0,n+3. Generally
speaking, webs by curves have not been studied as much as webs by hypersurfaces, which is a
pity since several of the most interesting results of web geometry precisely concern curvilinear
webs.

In this last section, we state a few questions/problems about webs by curves we ﬁnd interesting.

6.1. Octahedral webs. The notion of ‘octahedral web’ considered in [Da2] is interesting since
it appears as a generalization to curvilinear webs in arbitrary dimension of the basic notion of
‘hexagonal’ (aka ‘ﬂat’) planar 3-web. However, some quite basic questions about this notion
remain to be answered, such as the following ones:

•

•

•

Is a curvilinear (n + 1)-web of maximal rank (i.e. of rank 1) necessarily octahedral?

What is the moduli space of equivalence classes of curvilinear (n + 1)-webs of rank 1?

For planar 3-webs, being hexagonal is equivalent to being of rank 1, which is in turn
equivalent to being ‘ﬂat’, that is of having zero curvature. In dimension n
2 arbitrary,
is there a similar characterization of octahedral curvilinear (n + 1)-webs in terms of the
vanishing of certain diﬀerential invariants attached to such webs? Same question with
‘maximal rank’ instead of ‘octahedral’ (in case these two notions do not coincide when
n

3).

≥

≥

6.2. Algebraization of curvilinear (n + 2)-webs with maximal rank in dimension n? It is
classically known by web-geometers that Lie-Poincar´e’s approach to the linearization and alge-
braization of planar 4-webs with maximal rank generalizes to 2n-webs by hypersurfaces with rank
n + 1 on n-dimensional manifolds.50 The discussion in §4.3.1, aiming to give a representation-
theoretic description of the ARs of the curvilinear web formed by the bundles of lines passing
through n + 2 points in general position in Pn (for any n
2), is of geometric nature and can be
seen as well as a generalization for any n
2, but now for webs by curves, of Lie-Poincar´e’s ap-
proach just mentioned. It is natural to wonder whether the arguments presented in §4.3.1 actually
could apply to any curvilinear (n + 2)-web in Cn of rank n + 1.

Cn.
For any i and for ω generic in Ω, the i-th evaluation map associating to an AR for W the value
at ω of its i-th component, is a non trivial linear map the kernel of which deﬁnes an hyperplane
Pn. Letting ω vary in Ω (or possibly in a subdomain of it), we construct
κi(ω) in P
that way the ‘i-th canonical map’ κi : Ω ! ˇPn of W. Then, inspired by the (unproven) claims of
§4.3.1, we consider the ﬁve statements below (where for each of them the open domain Ω of Cn
we work on is allowed to be shrinked as much as needed):

At this point, any reader even slightly familiar with web geometry reading this line will surely
think that the preceding points necessarily imply the following one:

5. the vanishing of the traces of the tuples of diﬀerential forms corresponding to the ARs of
Wcan (cf. 4. just above) necessarily implies that everything, the Vi’s and the ARs of Wcan
actually are algebraic in the following (expected since classical) sense:

following statement holds true for any n

surface V

⊂

That the ﬁve points above are always satisﬁed seems very plausible to us. We believe that the
one which would require the most work to be established is the ﬁfth: an approach to prove it would
be to use the classical Abel-inverse theorem but this would require to show that in the situation

6.3.1. Let us be a bit more precise about what we have in mind here. Assume that n is odd:

PN. These varieties have been studied by several authors,
dimensional projective variety Vn
in particular in the recent paper [BM] where the authors establish many interesting properties of
them. Those which are interesting for our purpose here are the following ones, which appear as
generalizations of some basic properties of Segre’s cubic (which corresponds to the case m = 2):

We believe that giving answers in full generality to the questions asked above is diﬃcult. The
next case beyond the classical one of Segre’s cubic is already interesting and deserves to be
discussed on its own.

6.3.2. Case n = 5. The case when n = 5 is interesting since V5 has already been studied by
several authors: see for instance [R1] (in particular §3 and §11 therein) for a classical reference
and [FSM] or [HMSV] for recent ones.

Let p1, . . . , p7 be seven points in general position in P5. According to §2.2.1, V5 is the bira-
tional image of P5 by the rational map associated to the linear system of cubic hypersurfaces with
a double point at each pi. It can be veriﬁed that V5 lives in P13, has 35 isolated double points, is
of degree 40 and carries 8 covering families of lines. Many other interesting geometric properties
of V5 are listed in [R1, §11].

Another construction of V5 has been given by modern authors: from the recent references
indicated above, it can be deduced that V5 is the singular locus of an explicit cubic hypersurface
C
stands for the following
cubic form (in homogeneous coordinates X1, X2, Ya with a = 1, . . . , 4 and Zb for b = 1, . . . , 8):

P13 is then generated by the quadrics given by the par-
/∂U where U stands for any one of the fourteen homogeneous coordinates

Knowing an explicit generating set for I(V5) makes it possible to attack the questions raised
in the preceding subsection by means of eﬀective computations. We have tried to do so using
the software Macaulay2 but our attempt failed: even when working over a ﬁnite ﬁeld of small
cardinal to make everything simpler, the computations to get the ideal of the Fano variety of lines
Σ5 = F1(V5) were too memory-consuming so that we were not able to get to the end. A brute force
approach to study Σ5 does not seem very eﬃcient, understanding this Fano variety may require a
more conceptual approach.

Finally, let us mention a possibly naive idea about the varieties Vn for n odd bigger than 1 .
Both V3 and V5 can be deﬁned by means of an invariant cubic: V3 itself is a cubic (namely Segre’s
cubic S) and V5 = Sing(C) where C
= 0.

truth, we would be amazed if they can be answered in a positive way. In any case, these questions
were too beautiful and intriguing for not to be asked!

6.4. About the characterization of the webs by lines on cubic threefolds. Here we would like
to discuss brieﬂy some interesting questions indicated to us by Prof. J.-M. Hwang a few years
ago. The problem under scrutiny here can be considered in the bigger realm of Fano manifolds
of dimension 3 but for the sake of simplicity, we will only consider the case of cubic threefolds
below.

⊂

Let X

P4 be a generic (in particular smooth) cubic hypersurface and denote by F = F1(X) its
Fano surface. It follows from a more general result by Hwang (namely [Hw, Theorem 1.2]) that
the local analytic class of the 6-web by lines LW X characterizes X as a projective variety:
P4 be another smooth cubic hypersurface. Assume that there
Theorem 6.1 (Hwang). Let X′ ⊂
exists a local biholomorphism Φ : (X, x) ! (X′, x′) such that LW X,x = Φ∗
. Then Φ
is the germ at x of a global isomorphism between X and X′, which necessarily coincides with the
(cid:1)
restriction along X of a global projective automorphism of P4.

LW X′,x′

(cid:0)

This nice result is very much in the original spirit of web geometry, namely that webs are quite
rigid objects for which local analytic equivalence may imply (under some additional assumptions
of course) algebraic/global equivalence hence algebraization.

We ﬁnd it interesting to consider the previous result in the light of the remarkable algebraization
theorem of Blaschke and Walberer (about the algebraization of some maximal rank curvilinear 3-
webs in dimension 3, see Appendix B for more details). This suggests to wonder about a possible
algebraization result for the 6-webs by lines in dimension 3. In view of stating it, let us draw up
a list of some nice properties enjoyed by any curvilinear 6-web W equivalent to a web LW X
associated to a generic cubic threefold X: from the results of §3.1, it is clear that such a web W

1. is linearizable;
2. is skew;
3. has maximal 2-rank (equal to 10);
4. has its 1-rank bigger than or equal to 5;
5. is such that there exists a subspace A1(W)

LW X is skew indeed. A ﬁrst question that comes to mind for such X is the following:

Each of the ﬁve conditions listed above is a strong property and it is natural to expect that
any 6-web satisfying all of them must be of a very particular type. Considering this as well as
Blachke-Walberer’s algebraization theorem, it is natural to make the following

Conjecture 6.3. Any 6-web W satisfying the properties 1. to 5. above is equivalent to an alge-
braic web LW X associated to a cubic hypersurface X

P4.

L. PIRIO

Actually, we believe that the same conclusion holds true under the weaker assumption that
only the ﬁrst three of these conditions are satisﬁed.
It would be interesting to even drop the
linearizability assumption and to know whether a skew curvilinear 6-web in dimension 3 with
maximal 2-rank is necessarily linearizable. However, answering this may be quite diﬃcult.

6.5. The 6-web by planes on Perazzo’s cubic fourfold. In [Pera], Perazzo considers a certain
cubic hypersurface in P5, namely the one cut out by

with respect to some homogeneous coordinates X1, X2, X3, Y1, Y2, Y3 on P5, named after him and
here. This cubic enjoys several interesting properties and has been considered in
denoted by
several papers such as [Bak] or the more recent one [Loo], to which we refer the interested reader.

This shows that LW
, which is a 6-web of codimension 2 on a space of dimension 4, does not
satisfy the general position hypothesis usually assumed when working classically with webs of
this kind. Consequently the classical results about the ranks of webs of this type (cf. the material
of Chapter 8 of [Go]) do not apply to LW
. Considering the remarkable properties enjoyed by
W0,6 = LWS, one can wonder about the status of their direct generalizations to the web by planes

Appendix A: the abelian 1-ARs of

W0,6.

In §3 (see Proposition 3.1 more speciﬁcally), we have translated into terms of webs some
classical results about smooth cubic threefolds and their Fano surface. We then specialized some
of these results to the case of Segre’s cubic S to obtain a conceptual way to describe the 2-abelian
relations of LWS
≃ W0,6: the suitable version of ‘Abel’s theorem’ holds true for Segre’s cubic
and its Fano surface Σ = F1(S) as well and gives us a natural linear isomorphism H0(Σ, ω2
Σ

AR(2)
. Then in §3.3.4, by means of direct computations, we gave another much more
down to earth and elementary proof of this result .

For a smooth cubic X

P4, the 1-ARs of LWS all come from holomorphic 1-forms on the
corresponding Fano surface F1(X): see the content of Proposition 3.1 corresponding to k = 1. It
is natural to wonder whether this can be specialized to the pair (S, Σ) as well. This question has
already be discussed before (page 34) in the more general context of cubic threefolds with isolated
singularities. A strategy relying on deformations is evokated page 36 where it is mentioned that
it applies to Segre’s cubic. This approach relies on some unpublished results due to Collino.

In this Appendix, we are going to explain the main points of the abstract approach via defor-
mations in order to construct 1-ARs for LWS (identiﬁed with W0,6) from the global abelian
Σ of Σ. Because we ﬁnd it justiﬁed and funny, the
diﬀerential 1-forms on a certain modiﬁcation
ARs obtained that way will be called ‘Abelian 1-ARs’. Although conceptually interesting, the
lack of explicitness of the ﬁrst construction of these ARs is not fully satisfying. We will remedy
to this in a second stage. Proceeding as in §3.3.4, using explicit computations and some basic
facts of the theory of representations of S6, we will construct an explicit basis of a 5-dimensional
subspace of AR(1)

which naturally corresponds to the space of abelian 1-forms on

Σ.

Before entering into the considerations below, let us recall the following elementary fact about
the space of 1-ARs of W0,6. We know that this web is totally non skew:
two distinct of its
foliations are tangent to a foliation of codimension 1 (admitting for a ﬁrst integral a forgetful map
). Its follows that any of its 3-subwebs, and even more so W0,6
M0,6 !
itself, has a space of 1-ARs of inﬁnite dimension. The abelian relations we are interested in in
this Appendix are those coming from particular global rational 1-forms on the Fano surface of
Segre’s cubic. Thus these are 1-ARs of a very speciﬁc kind. In particular, they span a space of
ﬁnite dimension which makes undertaking their study more reasonable.

Our goal is to establish a property (namely, the vanishing of the trace) of some global rational
1-forms on F0 = Σ by using the fact that it can be obtained as a degeneration of the smooth Fano
<< 1). For this reason, we are only interested in the geometry of the aﬃne
surfaces Ft (with 0 <
pencil F on a vertical (analytic) neighbourhood of the ﬁber Σ = f −
1(0). According to [Col2,
Prop. 2.4], near t = 0 the pencil F is singular exactly at the points of Σ denoted by ℓi j,kl above
(and L[(i j), (kl)] in Collino’s paper). Moreover, these points, which are 45 in number, all are
ordinary quadratic singularities. Then Collino explains that when performing a particular small
blow-up at each of these isolated singular points, one gets a modiﬁed family

to describe the abelian 1-ARs of W0,6 which is much more elementary and explicit than the
previous one.

The birational model of W0,6 we are going to work with is the following: relatively to some
rational coordinates x1, x2, x3, we identify W0,6 with the web deﬁned by the six following rational
ﬁrst integrals: U1 = (x2, x3), U2 = (x1, x3), U3 = (x1, x2) and

Let us discuss how this proposition can be established. Our proof relies on some explicit

computations (performed on Maple) that we will not give here53 but only describe.

Proof. We set ζi = xi for i = 1, 2, 3 and ζ4 = 0, ζ5 = 1 and ζ6 =
. For k ranging from 1 to 3 and l
from k + 1 to 5, we set ζkl = ζk
ζl). The ηk,l’s are rational
logarithmic 1-forms on C3 which are linearly independent over C. Their span is a complex vector
space of dimension 9, denoted by LogΩ1

In order to prove the second point of the proposition, one starts by determining the character
of LogAR(1) as a representation of S6. We describe how we have proceeded. the following is a
complete set of representatives of the non trivial conjugacy classes of S6:

S =

(123)(456) , (1234) , (1234)(56) , (12345) , (123456)

.

We will use the following composition of group morphism

with Gσ being the birational map deﬁned in (12) and where Mσ stands for the matrix of G∗σ acting
on LogAR(1) expressed in the basis B (i.e. Mσ = MatB

For any permutation σ, it is just a computational matter (that we have handled using Maple)
to get an explicit expression for the birational map Gσ, hence for the matrix Mσ, from which one
can take the trace Tr(Mσ). For each σ in the set S , Gσ and Tr(Mσ) are given in Table 1 below.

Table 1 characterizes entirely the character of LogAR(1) as a S6-module, denoted by χ(1). We

the irreducible S6-representation Vλ associated to the partition λ. Using the character table of S6
-representations, it is not diﬃcult to conclude that necessarily χ(1) = χ(3,3) ⊕
χ(3,2,1). The sec-
ond point of the proposition follows immediately from that. Since V(3,2,1) has dimension 16 and
because Tr(1)

is a S6-submodule of LogAR(1) of dimension 5, we get point 3.

The preceding arguments used to show that AR(1)
ab

= V(3,3) are fully non constructive
and it is interesting and natural to seek for a basis of this 5-dimensional space. Such a basis is
provided by the 1-ARs associated to the ﬁve functional identities of Table 2 below. We were
able to determine these explicit functional relations using the following approach: ﬁrst, thanks to
formula (12), the group morphism S6 ! Bir(C3), σ 7! Gσ can be made explicit. Then using
Maple’s ‘DiﬀerentialGeometry’ package, one can compute the action of the pull-back by Gσ on
LogAR(1) with respect to the basis B. Eventually we computed (on a computer) the 21
21
square matrix Mσ for any of the 6! = 720 permutations σ element of S6.
Next, for χ = χ(3,3) or χ = χ(3,2,1), we have considered the matrix

(where 1 stands for the identity element of S6). From a classical result of the general theory of
representations of ﬁnite group (see [Lan, Chap. XVIII,§4] for instance), we know that Πχ is the
matrix in the basis B of the projection map LogA(1) = V(3,2,1) ⊕
V(3,3) ! Vχ. Since χ(3,3) was
known and because all the Mσ were previously computed, we have been able to construct Πχ(3,3)
explicitly. Considering suitable linear combinations of its columns led us to the 1-ARs associated
(cid:3)
to the ﬁve functional relations of Table 2.

Remark 6.8. 1. Using the same computational approach as in the preceding proof, one can show
that the character χ9 of the 9-dimensional S6-representation LogΩ1
0,6 is given by the following
table, where the symbols in the ﬁrst line stand for the possible decompositions into cycles with
pairwise distinct supports of the conjugacy classes in S6 (that is
means a cycle of length 2,
stands for a product of a 2-cycle with a 3-cycle, etc.):

that LogΩ1

Appendix B: the 1-ARs of the 3-web of lines on the chordal cubic.

In this appendix, we study the 1-ARs of the web of lines on the chordal cubic C (already
discussed in §3.2.1 above) and explain how this web can be seen as a particular case of a nice
family of curvilinear 3-webs studied by Blaschke and Walberer. We will take advantage of this to
recall some of their results which are among the most striking ones in web geometry although not
very well known by modern geometers.

B.1. the 1-ARs of the 3-web of lines on the chordal cubic. As explained in §3.2.1, the web
by lines on C is degenerated: LWC is a skew 3-web, and not a 6-web as for most of the cubic
threefolds. However, one can ask about the ARs of this web. It turns out that concerning 1-ARs,
this web is not less interesting than those associated to smooth cubic hypersurfaces. We use below
and U′ stand for the explicit rational ﬁrst integrals of
the notations introduced in §3.2.1: U′′+ , U′′
−
(a birational model of) LWC given in (27) and X′′+ , X′′
and X′ denote the associated vector ﬁelds
−
deﬁned just after.

According to a classical bound due to Kh¨aler,54 one has rk(1)

5 and the question is
whether this is actually an equality. This can be answered by determining an explicit basis for
AR(1)
LWC
. Since 1-ARs can be integrated into functional identities, one has to ﬁnd a basis of
non trivial 3-tuples of holomorphic functions of two variables (M, N, R) such that the functional

is identically satisﬁed. In §5.1.9, we brieﬂy explained how Abel’s method described in [P2] for
determining in an eﬀective way the ARs of planar webs can be generalized to the determination
of the 2-ARs of curvilinear webs (in dimension 3). It turns out that Abel’s method generalizes
quite straightforwardly to the case of the 1-ARs of such webs as well, and we will apply this quite
eﬀectively to the web under scrutiny.

(M, N, R) of (134): one ﬁrst applies X′ to the LHS of (134) in order to eliminate R(U′). Next one
divides by X′(U′′
2) and applies X′′
). Similarly, one divides the
−
−
expression just obtained by the coeﬃcient of N1(U′′
again: we have
−
eliminated all the terms in N and R (and in their partial derivatives) thus what remains can be seen
as a PDE in M(U′′+ ) with variable coeﬃcients. This gives us a system of linear PDEs of the third
order in M which is not diﬃcult to solve with the help of a computer algebra system.

One gets that, up to the addition of a complex constant, any function M appearing in an 1-AR

Considering Proposition A.1, it is natural to ask whether the 1-ARs of this web can be described
by means of some abelian diﬀerential 1-forms of the Fano surface F1(C ) (or possibly of a suitable
birational model of it) or not. But to do so one has to face some diﬃculties:

•

•

•

ﬁrst, since F1(C ) is not reduced as a scheme, what could be an abelian diﬀerential on it
is not clear, at least to the author; 55
assuming that the ﬁrst point might be settled, one expects an abelian 1-form on F1(C )

Addressing these points here would require too much space. Instead, we will discuss in the next
sub-appendix below another way to understand the ARs of LWC , by considering this web from
another point of view.

Finally, note that since the 2-rank of any skew curvilinear 3-web in dimension 3 is zero ac-
cording to [Bla3, S23], there is no point in considering the 2-ARs of LWC hence we will not talk
more about it.

which is similar to that considered in A.1 and relies on results due to Collino as well.

Their construction is as follows: let X

G1(P4) its Fano surface. In the following we do not consider F with its
denote by F = F1(X)
structure of scheme: we actually work with the underlying reduced surface Fred, that we will still
denote abusively by F to simplify the writing. By deﬁnition, the associated (labeled) ‘triangle
variety’ ∆ = ∆(X) is the closed algebraic subvariety of F3 formed by ‘triangles included in X’,
G2(P4)
namely triples T = (ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3) of lines included in X such that there exists a 2-plane π

One veriﬁes that ∆

F3 is of dimension 3 and that the non-degenerate triangles form a Zariski
open subset, denoted by ∆ = ∆(X), that we will also call abusively the ‘triangle variety’ of X when
it is not empty. By restriction, the natural projections F3 ! F onto the three distinct factors give
rise to three dominant rational maps Pi : ∆ d F which deﬁne three foliations by algebraic curves
on ∆. These foliations form what we call Blaschke-Walberer triangle web on ∆, denoted by

Let us say that X is W-admissible if for T

∆ generic: (1) T is a non-degenerate triangle, i.e.

∆ is non empty (hence it is dense in ∆); (2) the tangent spaces at T of the level subsets of the pi’s
through this point are in general position, i.e. ∆WX is a genuine curvilinear web on ∆ at T ; and
(3) this web is (generically) skew.

2. On the contrary, Segre’s cubic S is not W-admissible. This can be veriﬁed easily using its
P3
model in P3 described in §2.1.3 (see especially (17)). Let us describe the triangles in S
passing through a generic point q. Such a triangle is determined by two distinct lines passing
through q. In the model we are working with, two such lines correspond to the lines ℓs(q) =
P3 for s = 1, 2 say. The third edge of the triangle determined by (ℓ1(q), ℓ2(q)) is the

line l3(q) =
appearing in (136). It takes values into the dual projective plane ˇΠ123 of lines contained in Π123.
with Π123, we get
that actually Im(P3) is a line in ˇΠ123. This map is then of rank 1 and its generic ﬁber is a surface
(actually, the ﬁber of P3 through q is clearly the 2-plane
). Thus P3 deﬁnes a foliation
by 2-planes, hence ∆WS is not a curvilinear web, which shows that S is not W-admissible.
3. But the property to be W-admissible for a cubic threefold is not directly related to the fact
that it is singular or not. For instance, the chordal cubic C is W-admissible although having a
singular locus of dimension 1.

Proof (sketched). Assuming that X is smooth, one veriﬁes easily that ∆X is non empty and gener-

A remarkable result obtained by Blaschke and Walberer in their paper is that the web-theoretic
content of the preceding proposition actually holds true for any cubic threefold as soon as its web
of triangles is W-admissible:

We think that this result deserves some comments. It is proved in the sixth and last section
of [BW] by means of a rather explicit approach. Very roughly, from a cubic equation deﬁning a
P4 and after six pages of explicit algebraic computations, the authors
W-admissible cubic X
build rational 1-forms ui for i ranging from 1 to 5 (see formula (68) in [BW]) which they show to
give rise to ﬁve linearly independent 1-abelian relations for ∆W X. They do not establish that the
ui are precisely the ‘Abelsche Integrale erster Gattung’56 of the Fano
corresponding integrals
surface of lines included in X, but this is strongly suggested at the very end. Thanks to Proposition
6.9, we know that it is indeed the case, at least when X is smooth.

R

Although computational, Blaschke and Walberer’s approach is very interesting according to
us, essentially for two reasons: ﬁrst, being algebraic in nature, it allows a priori to handle the case
of singular cubics as well; the proof of the second point of Proposition 6.9 relies on point xvi. of

56Translated by ‘Abelian integrals of the ﬁrst kind’ into English.

§3.1.1 (with k = 1), the only modern proof of which we are aware of (p. 332 of [ClG]) relies on
a basic but non-explicit principle of complex analysis;57 this leads us to the second reason, which
is that the approach in [BW, §6] gives rise to explicit algebraic formulas for the abelian 1-forms
on F1(X) which is interesting and has nothing comparable in modern literature to our knowledge.
Since one can take great beneﬁt from explicit formulas for the holomorphic or abelian diﬀerentials
on a projective variety58 it would be very interesting to revisit the results of Blaschke and Walberer
by taking a more modern (and therefore perhaps more accurate and rigourous) approach.

115

But the most striking result in [BW] is actually not the preceding proposition but rather its
following converse which can be considered as one of the most interesting results in what concerns
the algebraization of webs59
Blaschke-Walberer’s algebraization theorem. Let W be a skew curvilinear 3-web in C3 with
maximal 1-rank. Then W is equivalent to the triangle web ∆W X of a cubic hypersurface X
P4.

The proof of this theorem consists in many pages of normalisations and computations that we
do not have considered in detail yet. Our impression is that this is a genuine computational tour
de force. Still, as for the previous result, we believe it would be interesting and even necessary
to go over Blaschke-Walberer’s proof again, with the modern standard of mathematical rigour in
order to certify that any of their arguments or computations is indeed correct.

⊂

Our opinion that the content of [BW] should be revisited should not lead one to believe that we
doubt the validity of the above results: this is not the case. In the next subsection we use them to
get another and better understanding of LWC and of its 1-ARs.

Ending this sub-section, it is interesting to point out that a notion of ‘triangle varieties’ gen-
eralizing the one discussed here has been recently considered by algebraic geometers for hyper-
K¨ahler manifolds (see [Baz, Voi]) and ﬁrst results show that it is a relevant notion in what regards
the study of these varieties. It would be interesting to ﬁgure out whether this notion might give
relevant outputs in web geometry as well.

C can be interpreted as ∆WC . Blaschke-Walberer theory will then apply and Proposition

Let X be an irreducible cubic threefold in P4 containing a non degenerate triangle. By deﬁni-

of its edges, one easily gets that each ck is dominant onto X and generically ﬁnite. Consequently,
given a generic base point T ∗ = (ℓ∗1, ℓ∗2, ℓ∗3) and setting x∗ = ck(T ∗), each corner map ck induces a
local biholomorphism ck : (∆X, T ∗) ! (X, x∗) which can be used to locally push-forward ∆W X

Note that the ﬁrst statement in this lemma holds true even if the lines trough a general point of
X come with multiplicities that is, even if LW X is a k-web with k < 6. This remark applies in the
case of the chordal cubic. Although LWC is only a 3-web, it has been veriﬁed that this web is
skew in §3.2.1 (more precisely, see (28)). From the preceding lemma, we get that the triangle web
∆WC is skew, hence Proposition 6.10 applies and gives us a description of the 1-ARs in terms of
rational 1-diﬀerentials on the Fano surface F1(C ).

At this point, since both LWC and ∆WC are skew curvilinear 3-web with maximal 1-rank
constructed from the same cubic hypersurface, one can wonder how these two webs are related.
It turns out that they are actually the same as an easy computational veriﬁcation shows:

The proof is left to the reader. Note that this result is speciﬁc to the case of C . In general, the
push-forward by a corner map ck of the foliation induced by Pk is not linear on the considered
cubic.

Taking the pull-backs under a corner map of the total derivatives of the functional identities
(134), one gets a rational basis of AR(1)
which enjoys the interesting feature of being
completely explicit. On the other hand, the ﬁrst point of Proposition 6.10 oﬀers another view on
(cid:1)
the 1-ARs of ∆WC , more abstract and conceptual but not really explicit. It would be interesting
to relate more concretely these two descriptions of the abelian relations under scrutiny and to get
a description of them which would be intrinsic and conceptual as well as explicit.
