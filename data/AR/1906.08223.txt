Precision measurements of slow neutron cross sections with atoms have several scientiﬁc appli-

cations. In particular the n-4He s-wave scattering length is important to know both for helping to

constrain the nuclear three-body interaction and for the proper interpretation of several ongoing

slow neutron experiments searching for other types of neutron-atom interactions. We present new

measurements of the ratios of the neutron diﬀerential scattering cross sections of the noble gases

He, Ar, Kr, and Xe, to Ne. All gases used were of natural isotopic-abundance. These measurements

were performed using a recently developed neutron scattering apparatus for gas samples located

on a pulsed slow neutron beamline which was designed to search for possible exotic neutron-atom

interactions and employs both neutron time of ﬂight information and a position - sensitive neutron

detector for scattering event reconstruction. We found agreement with the literature values of

scattering cross sections inferred from Ar/Ne, Kr/Ne and Xe/Ne diﬀerential cross section ratios

over the q range of 1 − 7 nm−1. However for the case of He/Ne we ﬁnd that the cross section

inferred diﬀers by 11.3% (7.6 σ) from previously-reported values inferred from neutron phase shift

measurements, but is in reasonable agreement with values from other measurements. The very

large discrepancy in the He/Ne ratio calls for a new precision measurement of the n-4He scattering

length using neutron interferometry.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Precision measurements of slow neutron-atom cross sections have several scientiﬁc appli-

cations [1, 2]. The neutron atom scattering cross section is sensitive to the neutron-nucleus

interaction, the neutron-electron interaction, the eﬀects of the neutron electric polarizability

from the large electric ﬁeld experienced by the neutron near the nucleus, and new interactions

from possible exotic forces [3]. These diﬀerent interactions all contain a diﬀerent dependence

on the neutron incident energy and on the momentum transfer to the atom and can there-

fore be separated experimentally. For light nuclei up to carbon, the neutron-nucleus s-wave

scattering lengths which determine the cross section are now of interest to constrain the

nuclear few-body force since theory can now calculate the eﬀects of the well-measured NN

interaction from ﬁrst principles [4–8]. Both the neutron-electron interaction and the neu-

tron electric polarizability are of interest for the important information they convey about

the internal electromagnetic structure of the quarks in the neutron, whose understanding

is a major goal for direct calculation from quantum chromodynamics using lattice gauge

theory [9–12]. The dependence of the neutron-atom cross section on the incident energy,

momentum transfer, and mass of the atom can be used to search for possible exotic inter-

actions of the neutron from new weakly-coupled interactions mediated by exchange bosons

with meV-eV masses [13], from short-range modiﬁcations to the gravitational interaction

from extra dimensions of spacetime [14], and from certain models for dark matter [15, 16].

It is therefore always scientiﬁcally useful to improve the precision of these measurements.

Measurements on one of the nuclei presented in this work, 4He, are of particular scientiﬁc

interest. Although the values for the two s-wave neutron scattering lengths b± corresponding

to the scattering amplitudes in the two angular momentum channels J = I ± 1/2 where I

is the nuclear spin cannot be calculated for arbitrarily large nuclei at the present time,

the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction is now measured with enough precision that neutron-

nucleus scattering amplitude calculations at low energy in few body nuclei such as H, D,

3H, 3He, and 4He can be compared with experiment to give important information on the

poorly-constrained three-body NNN interaction, which is known to be important in nuclei

as it is now understood to be responsible for about 10% of the nuclear binding energy in few

nucleon systems. This need has motivated several precision experiments in few body nuclei

over the last two decades using neutron pseudomagnetic precession [17, 18] and neutron

3

interferometry [19–23] to access the spin-dependent and spin-independent components of

the s-wave n-A scattering amplitudes. The single n-4He scattering amplitude b4 from the
I = 0 4He nucleus is of particular interest for the interpretation of many slow neutron

measurements which search for other types of neutron interactions. The ﬁrst numerical

solution of the ﬁve-body Fadeev-Yakubovsky equations relevant for n-4He scattering was

published in 2018 by Lazauskas and Song [24], who also published a more recent calculation
[25] of the parity-odd neutron spin rotation rotary power dφ
dz in n- 4He, which has been
sought experimentally in an eﬀort to parametrize the weak interaction in the low energy non-

perturbative regime of QCD [27, 28]. The result of this recent calculation gives a diﬀerent

result compared to past calculations for the P-odd asymmetry in this observable and also

makes a prediction for the n-4He scattering length which can be compared to measurement.

The interpretation of a recent experiment using ultracold neutron (UCN) upscattering in

4He gas as a probe of possible exotic interactions [29] also relies on the knowledge of this

amplitude. Measurements in progress of the neutron-electron interaction and searches for

possible exotic Yukawa interactions of the neutron with atoms using the q-dependence of

scattering from noble gas atoms [30] will eventually beneﬁt from a high precision measure-

ment of the strong n-4He scattering amplitude.

Unfortunately measurements of σ4He = 4πb2

4 using diﬀerent techniques (neutron interfer-
ometry [31], neutron transmission [32], neutron refraction [33], and UCN upscattering [29])

disagree by 10%, which is unacceptably large for all of the applications referred to above.

It is also scientiﬁcally embarrassing as for a I = 0 nucleus like 4He the technique of neutron

interferometry is quite capable of determining the scattering length and therefore the total

s-wave scattering cross section with much better than 10−3 absolute accuracy. The main

goal that motivated the analysis of the measurements presented in this paper is to contribute

to the resolution of this inconsistency in the experimental data on 4He. The sensitivity of

our measurements, which approach 0.3% precision, are more than suﬃcient for this purpose.

We have measured the ratio of the diﬀerential scattering cross sections of the noble

gases He, Ar, Kr, and Xe to Ne, all of natural isotopic-abundance, by performing neutron

scattering measurements on the Neutron Optics and Physics (NOP) cold neutron beam line

located at the Material Life Science Facility (MLF) at J-PARC. The instrumention for these

measurements has been described in detail in [30], where it was used to search for deviations

from the inverse square law of gravity by studying the momentum transfer (q) dependence

4

of neutrons scattered by noble gases using neutron time-of-ﬂight, complementing a similar

measurement done earlier at a continuous beam reactor neutron source [34]. Gases were

chosen for this measurement because the neutron dynamic structure factor S(q, ω) can be

calculated analytically in the ideal gas limit [35], thereby making it possible to conduct a

quantitative analysis of the angular distribution of the scattering and look for deviations

from the dominant s-wave contribution from the neutron-nucleus interaction.

Our instrument was not designed to measure transmitted neutron intensity so we did not

conduct absolute measurements of the total scattering cross section. However the relative

measurements of the diﬀerential cross section that we present are very valuable as several

systematic uncertainties cancel in the ratio due to the use of the identical instrumentation

and sample environment for the diﬀerent gas samples. Examples of potential systematic

uncertanties which this measurement is relatively insensitive to include, but are not limited

to, the absolute pressure and temperature measurements needed to infer the number density

of the gas, the absolute knowledge of the thickness of the gas sample container windows, the

absolute knowledge of various types of neutron detector backgrounds and electronic oﬀsets,

etc. As most of the other measurements conducted in these nuclei were performed in isolation

using completely diﬀerent apparatus and techniques, diﬀerences between the diﬀerential

scattering cross section ratios we present and the values from previous measurements are

more likely to indicate the possible presence of uncontrolled systematic uncertainties. Neon

of natural isotopic-abundance seems to have the most accurately determined and internally

consistent scattering cross section data from previous work and for this reason it was chosen

as the sample to normalize all of the cross section measurements from the other gas samples.

In addition, to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst such set of neutron diﬀerential cross section

ratio measurements on the noble gases conducted using a pulsed neutron source, where one

can use neutron time-of-ﬂight information to improve event selection and signal/background

separation. Previous work by Krohn et al. [36], which was motivated by an attempt to

measure the neutron-electron interaction, also measured scattering cross section ratios from

noble gas samples. However this measurement was conducted at a continuous beam reactor

neutron source without the beneﬁt of the use of a broad set of neutron energies for additional

systematic uncertainty suppression. Our measurement also shares some common approaches

with an earlier high-precision measurement of the n−3He total cross section in the epithermal

energy range from 1 eV to 1 keV [37] that was also performed at a pulsed neutron source,

5

but by contrast our measurement was performed using meV neutron energies at nonzero

scattering angles rather than eV-keV neutron energies in transmission.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

The total coherent neutron-atom scattering amplitude for the case of an unpolarized

neutron incident upon a ﬁxed, isolated noble gas atom can be written in terms of the

momentum transferred from the neutron to the atom during scattering, q, as [38]

bc(q) = bc + bE(q) + bM(q)

(1)

where bc is the q-independent low energy s-wave nuclear scattering amplitude from the strong

interaction, bE(q) describes interactions between the neutrons charge distribution and the

atomic electric ﬁeld, bM(q) arises from interactions between the neutrons magnetic dipole

moment and the slowly varying electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the scattering centers. For

the case of diamagnetic atoms (such as the noble gases) with very low incoherent scattering

cross sections the contribution from bM(q) to the diﬀerential cross section is at most 10−6

times the size of the nuclear contribution, making it negligible compared to our experimental

uncertainty. The electric scattering amplitude is written as

bE(q) = −beZf (q) ,

(2)

where be = −1.32(4) × 10−3 fm [39, 40] is the neutron-electron scattering amplitude, Z is

the atomic charge number, and f (q) is the atomic form factor which can be computed to

suﬃcient precision using a relativistic Hartree - Fock approximation, whose results are tab-

ulated in the International Tables for Crystallography [41].

The total diﬀerential cross section is proportional to the sum of squares of the q-dependent

coherent and q-independent incoherent scattering lengths b2

i respectively. Due to
the relatively small value of be, the diﬀerential cross section be approximated by neglect-
ing terms of O(< 10−3bN), as dσ

In this limit it is clear that the

c(q) and b2

i + 2bcbE(q).

c + b2

dΩ ≈ b2

only q-dependence comes from the interference between the nuclear and electric scattering

amplitudes.

However since this expression applies only to a ﬁxed and isolated scattering center, it

will not accurately describe experimental neutron scattering data which consists of scatter-

ing from moving gas atoms which may exchange energy with the neutrons and experience

6

interatomic Van Der Waals - type interactions. A more general expression which accounts

for these eﬀects and is suﬃciently accurate for our purposes can be written as [42]

c + a2

i + 2acbE(q)} + (S(q) − 1)F (q, 2A, T ){a2

c + 2acbE(q)}

(3)

where ac and ai are the coherent and incoherent free-atom nuclear scattering lengths, related

to the respective bound values via the ratio of the atomic mass to the neutron mass, A, as

a = ( A

A+1)b. F (q, A, T ) is a kinematical factor which takes into account the thermal motion
of the target atoms which are part of an equilibrium ensemble at temperature T . S(q) is

the structure factor which describes interference eﬀects arising from atom-atom correlations

in the gas coming from Van der Waals interactions and can in principle be calculated using

the virial expansion treatment of non-ideal gases. The structure factor in Eq. (3) is given

for the case of a spherically symmetric potential to ﬁrst approximation by

S(q) = 1 +

(4)

where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, r is the interatomic distance,

and U (r) is the interatomic potential. We chose to use the ordinary Lennard-Jones (or

“six-twelve”) potential to describe the interatomic interactions with the parameters given in

[43]. Although there exist several realistic interatomic potentials to model this interaction

[44] we found that the diﬀerence among them was undetectable in our relatively low and

narrow q range for the statistical sensitivity of our measurement. The total cross section

can be computed by simply integrating Eq. (3) over the entire 4 π solid angle.

III. METHODOLOGY

The technique we use to determine the total scattering cross sections via diﬀerential

scattering cross section measurements is as follows:

1. Acquire angular and energy-dependent scattering data for each gas and form the ratios

of each spectrum with respect to Ne.

7

2. Perform a Monte Carlo simulation using the experimentally determined energy spec-

trum and beam divergence, and literature values of the scattering cross sections as

inputs in order to reproduce the spectra obtained in (1).

3. Form a ratio of the experimental and simulated results in (1) and (2) to determine

our measured value for the scattering cross section, which is given by an overall shift

of the spectra.

Forming the ratio between two gases replaces the requirement of knowing absolutely the

thickness of the gas sample container windows and energy- and scattering angle-dependent

eﬃciencies of our neutron detector, with that of relative knowledge, which greatly surpresses

the eﬀect of possible related systematic uncertainties. This means however that our tech-

nique is not capable of an absolute scattering cross section measurement and is thus reliant

upon the literature for one of the gas species in order to infer cross section values of the

remaining gases. Ne currently has the most precise cross section values in the literature

([32], [45], [46]), and so it was chosen as the reference gas.

A. Experimental Setup

We performed our experiment on a simple scattering apparatus located on the Low-

Divergence beam branch of the NOP beamline at J-PARC [47–49] whose peak energy was

measured to be 11.7 meV at the time of measurement. The beam power during data acquisi-

tion was approximately 410 kW. The essential components consist of a gas cell, an evacuated

scattering chamber (also called the “vacuum chamber”) and a 3He position sensitive detector

(PSD). The entrance and exit windows of the gas cell were made of 0.1 mm-thick aluminum

windows. When ﬁlled with gas, the cell was pressurized to approximately 1.85 atm. Between

the measurement of each gas species the cell was evacuated and scattering data was collected

for the empty cell condition. This allowed for monitoring of the stability of the apparatus

between runs which allowed us to ensure that components in the beamline had not shifted

between ﬁlls.

The experimental layout is shown in Figure 1. A more detailed description of the func-

tionality of the apparatus can be found in [30] where the q-dependence of low energy neutron-

noble gas scattering was studied in eﬀorts to search for possible deviations from the inverse

8

square law of gravity. The region of q used in the present measurement which is dictated by

the neutron energy spectrum and the experimental geometry is 1 − 7 nm−1.

Before taking gas scattering data we mapped the intensity distribution in the incident

neutron beam using a 1 × 1 mm2 collimator formed from two sets of neutron absorbing

B4C plates. By recording the data as a function of slit position in the x-y plane, a two-

dimensional intensity and time-of-ﬂight distribution was obtained. These distributions are

used as input for the Monte Carlo simulation.

B. Simulation

The experiment was simulated using the Monte Carlo method implemented within the

ROOT analysis framework. Neutrons are generated in a loop and assigned an energy and

position chosen from the two-dimensional scans of neutron intensity of the beam described

in the previous section. Neutrons are propagated to and from scattering centers using

standard kinematic relations. The interaction point is determined by the total interaction

cross section used as input. If an interaction occurs, it is determined to be scattering or

absorbing according to their relative probabilities. If a neutron scatters from a gas atom

near the upstream edge of the cell it is less likely to reach the detector due to the reduced

solid angle, which may have a small eﬀect on the measured neutron scattering angular

dependence, distinct from the neutron-atomic interactions. It is therefore important that

we select input cross sections that are close to the expected values so that the angular

9

dependence is suﬃciently reproduced. We found that using existing literature values were

suﬃcient for this purpose.

Once scattered, the neutron angular distribution is determined from Eq.(3) and is propa-

gated to the detector according to the experimental geometry. The ROOT framework then

allows us to store and view the ﬁnal phase space coordinates using appropriate time-of-ﬂight

and angular cuts so that the results could be directly compared with experimental data.

IV. RESULTS

The neutron count rate was measured separately for each gas species and for the empty

cell. Empty-cell data is subtracted from that of the gas-ﬁlled cell and subsequently nor-

malized by the number density (as measured via independent pressure and temperature

measurements) and the proton beam power at MLF during data aquisition. The results

are displayed in Table I. Corrections to the ideal gas law were made when computing the

number density using the second virial coeﬃcients given in [50] for He, and [51] for the other

gases.

To determine the value of the cross section we ﬁrst consider the general expressions for

the experimental and simulated count rates neglecting the possibility of multiple scattering

events (See Sec. IV A),

(6)

where (cid:15)(q) describes any q-dependence which arises from the cell-detector geometry (e.g.

scattering from an extended object vs. point) and detector eﬃciency. If there were no q-

dependence due to the detector eﬃciency, the simulation and the experiment would reveal

the same q spectra for a given species diﬀering only by a constant factor. This however

was not the case as the detector eﬃciency was found to increase slightly as a function of q,

due to an increase in mean free path of the neutron in the 3He detector with an increase in

scattering angle, a gas species - indepdendent eﬀect. Since the exact form of this function

was not known for our detector, to determine the scattering cross section we formed the

10

following ratio between two gases, one of which was always Ne, causing the respective (cid:15)(q)

terms to cancel:

where the sums are carried out over q values (120 total in our measurement) in the range

from q = 1 − 7 nm−1.

Except for the case of Ne, we do not propagate errors in the literature associated with

those input values used in the simulation as they only serve as scaling factors. However since

the reference value for Ne remains in the expression used to determine the measured cross

sections, the errors are propagated to the listed simulated count rate ratios, and therefore

to the measured scattering cross sections reported later in Sec. IV B.

value σN e

b = 2.628(6) [52], converted to the free-atom value in the simulation, are given in the

fourth column. The input free-atom cross sections used in the simulation are given in the ﬁfth

column. Uncertainties in the experimental data originate from statistics only. Uncertainties in

the simulated data arising from the propagation of the literature uncertainty for Ne dominate the

statistical uncertainty in the simulated data.

The count rate alone is not enough to infer the cross sections of the gases as there are

contributions from the thermal motion of the gas atoms, the atomic electric ﬁeld, and the

interatomic potential experienced by the gas atoms. We compared the ratio of the count

11

rate of a gas species with respect to Ne (Table I, column 3) to the respective ratio of the

simulated values (Table I, column 4) using the values in column 5 as input free-atom scat-

tering cross sections.

The values used as inputs for the scattering cross sections and scattering lengths were

taken from [52] for He, Ne, and Ar, and from [36] for Xe and Kr. It would appear that

the measured He count ratio is signiﬁcantly lower than predicted by simulation as com-

pared to the other gas species, but consistent with the older literature results from neutron

transmission which will be discussed later.

1. Pressure and Temperature Stability

The pressure and temperature of the gas sample was measured continuously throughout

each run using Mensor CPG2400 digital pressure gauge, a Pfeiﬀer PKR251 ion gauge, and

a PT100 platinum resistance thermometer with accuracies of 300 Pa (0.15%) at 2 atm, and

60 mK (0.02%) at 300 K, respectively.

The average values of pressure and temperature for each run were used to determine the

number density, which was in turn used to normalize the data to give a measured intensity

per atom in the gas target. The pressure and temperature data was veriﬁed to either decrease

or increase monotonically throughout each run so that the average value used to infer the

target density is correct to ﬁrst order. Higher order eﬀects arising from the change the

temperature and pressure dependence of the scattering function used in the simulation are

less than 10−5 in magnitude and thus negligible.

2. Pressure dependence of cell geometry

A possible source of unwanted systematic scattering uncertainties may arise from the fact

that, when pressurized, the thin Al windows of the gas cell become slightly distorted relative

to an unpressurized, evacuated cell. Since empty-cell data was subtracted from gas-ﬁlled

data in our analysis it was necessary to quantify the size of this eﬀect. The distortion of the

Al windows may give rise to a change in the measured q spectra and/or total transmission

of the neutron beam, both due to the slight change in thickness of the warped window.

To estimate the change in thickness of the Al window, we ﬁrst measured the deﬂection of

the center of the window after pressurization to ∼ 2 atm and found it to be no more than

3 mm. We then use the computed ratio of the unpressurized and pressurized surface areas as

a reduction factor to the thickness of the window, assuming that the window volume remains

constant during pressurization. The reduction in thickness in the region of the window seen

by the neutron beam was found to be 0.03%. When considering only the change in beam

attenuation from nuclear scattering, a negligibly small ∼ 10−5 eﬀect in the measured cross

section is found when forming the ratio of vacuum subtracted measurements with respect

to Ne.

13

Another eﬀect which may arise due to the change in thickness of the Al windows is

that of inelastic single-phonon scattering. The size of inelastic single-phonon scattering in

the diﬀerential cross section is approximated from measurement for the case of Al at room

temperature in [53]. A roughly constant eﬀect on the intensity of I(q) = 5.2 × 10−4/cm/sr

was found, which when converted to a microscopic diﬀerential cross section is 8.7 × 10−3

bn/sr. Given our solid angle acceptance of Ω = 0.034 the eﬀect is 2.96 × 10−4 and as

it is applied only to the change in window thickness computed above, makes a negligible

contribution to our uncertainty in our cross section measurement.

3. Multiple Scattering

If a neutron interacts with more than one gas atom before reaching the detector, Eq. 5 and

Eq. 6 are not exactly correct and our method of extracting the cross section via Eq. 7 may

fail. Fortunately, the probability of multiple scattering is very small given the gas pressures

used and the geometry of our setup. For example, the probability of a single scattering

even from an ideal gas of cross section σ and number density n in a cylinder of length L is

given by p1 = 1 − e−ρσL. If we consider the gas with the largest measured scattering cross
section Kr, with σf = 7.61, the scattering probability in a typical run is p1 ≈ 4 × 10−3,

or 0.4%. This value can provide a rough estimate for the relative likelihood of multiple to

single scattering. In that case we see that this eﬀect may be on the order of our statistical

precision and must be corrected for via the computation of correction factors for each gas.

To compute the correction factors, the original simulation code was adjusted to account

for multiple scattering events under the assumption of isotropic scattering to signiﬁcantly

reduce computation time for practicality. This is justiﬁed since the scattering function is

isotropic to < 1% for all gases in our region measured region of q. The correction factors

were found to fall in the range of [2−11]×10−4, causing a shift in the measured cross section

values by < 0.1% in our measurement. These corrections are included in our reported values

in Table II.

14

4. Uncertainty in Simulation

The statistical uncertainty in the Monte Carlo simulation is computed in exactly the same

manner as in the experiment, where the number of simulated scattered neutrons reaching

the detection region, N , follow a Poisson distribution and thus contribute 1/

N to the

√

counting error. The number N for the simulated gases was at least an order of magnitude

larger than the number of experimentally detected neutrons so that the contribution from

simulation statistical error was relatively small.

In our analysis we form the ratio between vacuum-subtracted experimental data for the

gases while the simulated data accounts for scattering only from the gas (it does not include

background scattering from the cell windows). Because each gas has a diﬀerent transmission

probability, the vacuum data must be scaled appropriately for each gas before subtraction

so that scattering from the beam stop and from the downstream aluminum cell window and

vacuum chamber ﬂange is completely removed. This was done by scaling the vacuum run

energy spectra using the attenuation factor e−ρ σT L where ρ is the number density, σT is

the total interaction cross section (scattering plus absorption), and L is the cell thickness.

Uncertainties in values for the total cross section are small but not entirely negligible for the

cases of Xe and Kr whose absorption cross section uncertainties are relatively large. For Xe,

the absorption cross section σabs is 25.1(1.0) bn [36] which translates to an uncertainty of

0.023% in our determination of the scattering cross section. Likewise for Kr, σabs is 25.0(8)

which translates to an uncertainty in σs of 0.013%. These uncertainties were propagated

to the ﬁnal cross section values, however uncertainty in the transmission values for the

remaining gases was less than 10−5 and thus negligible.

The purpose of forming the ratio between two simulated gas scattering results is to de-

termine the relative angular dependence of the scattering between two gases so that the

only diﬀerence between the ratio of two gases in a simulation compared to the experiment

is a constant multiple whose magnitude indicates the deviation of the experimental cross

section from the theoretical input. Error in the q-dependence of the simulation resulting

from uncertainties in the values of the neutron electron scattering legnth, the coherent and

incoherent scattering lengths, and the Lennard-Jones parameters used to compute the inter-

atomic pair potential were determined by varying the input parameters over the published

uncertainty and comparing the resulting q spectra. The distributions changed at the level

15

of 10−5 and thus contribute negligibly in the determination of the cross section value at the

level of 0.1%.

A+1 )2 σb, where A is the ratio of the atomic

mass to the neutron mass, computed in [36], and given in the second row of this table.

The values of the total free-atom scattering cross section are obtained from our data by

forming the ratio of the q spectra of the experimental and simulated data integrated over all

measured q values. This ratio is then multiplied by the scattering cross section used in the

simulation for the non-Ne gas to obtain the measured cross section of that gas. The value

of the scattering cross section for Ne is assumed to be 2.628(6) bn (taken from [52]) in our

analysis.

Our results for the ratio of the diﬀerential cross sections of Ar, Kr, and Xe with respect

to Ne are consistent with existing literature values, both from neutron transmission and

neutron interferometry measurements [32, 36, 52, 54]. For the case of Xe and Kr our val-

ues are the most precise. However the case for He is very diﬀerent from the results from

neutron interferometry but are in agreement with the other previous measurements using

transmission and UCN upscattering [32, 55]. The results are summarized in Table II and

are compared with free atom cross sections in the literature in Figure 3.

Our measured bound scattering cross section, σHe

tering length corresponding to our result in Table II is bHe

b = 1.188(5) is in disagreement with the
b = 1.34(2) in [52], a discrepancy of 7.6 standard deviations. The bound n-4He scat-
c = 3.075(6) fm. This diﬀers from
c = 3.26(3) fm from the neutron interferometry measurement in [31] which is
listed in a compilation [52] which is often quoted in the literature, and is the same reference

from which we are taking our Ne reference value from.

It is worth noting that if one wanted to know the results of our cross section measure-

ments if a diﬀerent value for the Ne cross section was used in the normalization, a very good

approximation (< 1%) can be made by mutiplying the value of our measured cross section to

the ratio of the Ne cross section in [52] to the alternative reference value. For example, in the

Atlas of Neutron Resonances [54] the free atom Ne cross section is given as σNe

Using this value instead as a normalization results in a value of bHe

Given our result and its consistency with other n-4He measurements, we strongly suspect

interferometry result in n-4He. It is therefore very timely that a new neutron interferom-

etry measurement of the coherent scattering length of n-4He, conducted mainly with the

motivation to help constrain the three-nucleon interaction, has been recently carried out at

the Neutron Interferometry and Optics Facility (NIOFa) at the NIST Center for Neutron

Research, described in a recent Ph.D thesis [56], however the results are not published at

the time of this writing.

A change in the accepted value of σ(4He) is also relevant for the results of a recent analysis

which searched for possible exotic interactions of the neutron using upscattering of ultracold

neutrons from helium gas [29]. If our results are conﬁrmed by subsequent measurements

then the conclusions of this analysis may need to be reexamined.

V. CONCLUSION

We performed neutron diﬀerential scattering cross section measurements of the noble

gases He, Ar, Kr, and Xe, relative to Ne on BL05 at the MLF facility at J-PARC. The

values of the total scattering cross sections inferred from our measurements are consistent

with the literature values of Ar, Kr, and Xe, where for Kr and Xe our measurements are

the most precise. However our data suggests a value for the total scattering cross section

for n-4He which is in disagreement with existing neutron interferometry data, but consistent

with older data based on transmission and reﬂectometry. A new neutron interferometry

measurement of n-4He from NIST has been carried out however the results are not yet

published. The value from this new measurement will be important for nuclear few body

theory and for the proper interpretation of a number of ongoing and planned measurements

of neutron electroweak interactions with atoms and also for diﬀerent neutron searches for

possible exotic interactions.

The other noble gas which deserves higher precision neutron scattering length measure-

ments in the near future is xenon. Better data on this nucleus would be helpful for the

interpretation of the ongoing J-PARC noble gas scattering measurements already mentioned

above. Natural isotopic abundance xenon has several stable isotopes, but only two of these

stable isotopes, 129Xe and 131Xe, have nonzero nuclear spin. Therefore three measurements

would be suﬃcient for a complete characterization of the coherent and incoherent scattering

18

amplitudes of the natural isotopic abundance mixture of xenon gas which will be used in the

J-PARC gas scattering measurements. One of these measurements can be neutron interfer-

ometry. The same apparatus used for n-4He can simply be ﬁlled with xenon to conduct this

measurement. The other two measurements would need to be conducted on polarized sam-

ples of 129Xe and 131Xe. Both of these nuclei can be polarized using spin-exchange optical

pumping in amounts suﬃcient that one could perform a polarized neutron pseudomagnetic

precession measurement to determine the diﬀerence a+ − a− of the s-wave scattering lengths

in these nuclei [57–59].
