ABSTRACT

Context. Thorium hollow cathode lamps (HCLs) are used as frequency calibrators for many high resolution astronomical spectro-
graphs, some of which aim for Doppler precision at the 1 m/s level.
Aims. We aim to determine the most suitable combination of elements (Th or U, Ar or Ne) for wavelength calibration of astronomical
spectrographs, to characterize diﬀerences between similar HCLs, and to provide a new U line-list.
Methods. We record high resolution spectra of diﬀerent HCLs using a Fourier transform spectrograph: (i) U-Ne, U-Ar, Th-Ne, and
Th-Ar lamps in the spectral range from 500 to 1000 nm and U-Ne and U-Ar from 1000 to 1700 nm; (ii) we systematically compare
the number of emission lines and the line intensity ratio for a set of 12 U-Ne HCLs; and (iii) we record a master spectrum of U-Ne to
create a new U line-list.
Results. Uranium lamps show more lines suitable for calibration than Th lamps from 500 to 1000 nm. The ﬁlling gas of the lamps
signiﬁcantly aﬀects their performance because Ar and Ne lines contaminate diﬀerent spectral regions. We ﬁnd diﬀerences (up to 88%)
in the line intensity of U lines in diﬀerent lamps from the same batch. We ﬁnd 8239 isolated lines between 500 and 1700 nm⋆⋆ that
we attribute to U, 3379 of which were not contained in earlier line-lists.
Conclusions. We suggest using a combination of U-Ne and U-Ar lamps to wavelength-calibrate astronomical spectrographs up to
1 µm. From 1 µm to 1.7 µm, U-Ne shows better properties. The diﬀerences in line strength between diﬀerent HCLs underline the
importance of characterizing HCLs in the laboratory. The new 3379 U lines can signiﬁcantly improve the radial velocity precision of
astronomical spectrographs.

1. Introduction

Thorium hollow cathode lamps (HCLs) are the de facto standard
for wavelength calibration of astronomical high resolution
spectrographs. The high number of spectral features emitted
by HCLs from the cathode make these lamps good calibration
sources for astronomical spectrographs. Current instrumentation
used in searching for exoplanets (e.g. HARPS, Mayor et al.
2003 or CARMENES, Quirrenbach et al. 2014) use HCLs for
wavelength calibration and achieve meter per second radial
velocity precision. Commercially available HCLs fulﬁll most
of the criteria of an ideal calibrator (Stanley & Dieke 1955;
Kerber et al. 2007; Lovis & Pepe 2007): they are simple and
safe to handle, are relatively inexpensive and readily available
auxiliary equipment, and have a relatively long life time and
narrow lines while covering a wide spectral range.

Since the ﬁrst HCLs were introduced by Paschen (1916) as
a light source for spectroscopic investigations, continuous im-
provements have been made. The ﬁrst HCLs contained a vacuum
circulating system, described by Tolansky (1947), to prevent
impurities from outgassing, which shortened the life time of
the lamps. Further improvements of HCLs have been driven
by the requirements of atomic absorption (AA) spectroscopy
developed by Walsh in the 1950s. Dieke & Crosswhite (1952)
introduced an activated U getter (consisting of a vaporized reac-
tive metal layer deposited in the inner wall of the glass tube) for
Fe cathode-based HCLs. This design prevents outgassing and
yields a relatively long life time for sealed HCLs. Russell et al.
(1957) presented zirconium or tantalum getters, which allowed
HCLs of a wide variety of cathode materials to be sealed.
Jones & Walsh (1960) presented further improvements and
detailed studies about the construction and characteristics of the
sealed tubes used as a spectroscopic light source. With the in-
troduction of the getter and the improvement of the glass tube to
seal-oﬀ the HCLs, these lamps became commercially available.
Since then, HCLs have been widely used in applications where
narrow spectral lines are required, for example in the wave-

length calibration of high resolution astronomical spectrographs.

Current commercial HCLs use this sealed design and
contain a metal cathode, a metal anode, and a buﬀer gas at a
deﬁned pressure. The metal cathode can be either made of a
single species or of a combination of diﬀerent elements. The
buﬀer gas must be a nobel gas to avoid a chemical reaction with
the cathode material, which would contaminate the spectrum
with molecular emission lines. The front window of the glass
tube must be transparent in the wavelength region for which it
is used. The physical principles of operating HCLs have been
studied in great detail by diﬀerent authors (Crosswhite et al.
1955; Lieberman & Lichtenberg 1994; Huke et al. 2016). As
explained in Kerber et al. (2008), HCLs are operated by apply-
ing a voltage between the cathode and the anode. Therefore,
an electric potential is established between them. The negative
potential of the cathode accelerates the electrons towards the
anode. During this process, their energy increases until they
have suﬃcient energy to ionize the neutral buﬀer gas atoms
through inelastic collisions that create a hot plasma. The cations
from the plasma accelerate towards the cathode, colliding with
its surface at energies high enough to overcome the electronic
work function of the metal cathode. Material from the cathode
is sputtered at high velocities, usually in the form of unexcited
atoms. The sputtering rate depends on the cathode material,
the mass of the buﬀer gas, and the voltage applied between the
cathode and the anode. The sputtered material collides with
fast electrons ionizing the metal material, and with atoms from
the buﬀer gas, resulting in unstable excited states. The metal
and gas atoms relax back to the ground state and therefore
emit photons during the process. Therefore HCLs yield spectral
features from two diﬀerent sources: the material of the cathode
and the buﬀer gas. The intensitiy of the lines is dependent on
the operational current. Higher operational current yields a
higher voltage diﬀerence between the cathode and the anode.
The cations from the buﬀer gas hit the cathode with higher
energies, which in turn increases the rate of sputtered material
from the cathode (Kerber et al. 2008). Therefore, not only are
more metallic lines emitted, but metal lines also grow faster in
intensity than buﬀer-gas-emitted lines.

To use HCLs as calibrators for astronomical spectrographs,
the wavelength of the spectral lines must be known with high
accuracy and precision. Therefore, HCLs are measured in lab-
oratories using Fourier transform spectrographs (FTS), which
oﬀer the required precision and accuracy to carry out these inter-
ferometric measurements covering a wide spectral range. Great
eﬀorts have been made during the last decades to create line-lists
for diﬀerent cathode elements. The Th line-list presented by
Redman et al. (2014) (from now on R2014) combines precise
FTS measurements of Th-Ar HCLs with seven previous works
(Giacchetti et al. 1974; Zalubas & Corliss 1974; Zalubas 1976;
Palmer & Engleman 1983; Engleman et al. 2003; Lovis & Pepe
2007; Kerber et al. 2008) to calculate accurate Ritz wavelengths.

Pure Th cathode lamps have not been manufactured for
several years (Fischer et al. 2016). Current Th HCLs contain
a cathode made out of Th-oxide, which introduces impurities
into the cathode. High resolution measurements of the Th-oxide
lamp’s spectrum show undesirable spectral features, also known
as a "grass" of unidentiﬁed emission lines. These features
compromise the wavelength calibration of high accuracy radial
velocity spectrogaphs. Uranium HCLs have been proposed to
be used for high precision wavelength calibration in the near

infrared (NIR) spectral range in Redman et al. (2011) (from
now on R2011), where a line-list was published as a line-list
from 0.85 µm to 4 µm. R2011 complements previous works:
Palmer et al. (1980) created a high energy line-list from 3846 Å
to 9091 Å, and Conway et al. (1984) published a line-list from
1.8 µm to 5.5 µm. However, R2011 has a reduced number of
lines in the region around 1080 nm (9250 cm−1) because of the
low sensitivity of the 1-m FTS of the Kitt Peak National Solar
Observatory in that band. This spectral region overlaps the Y
band, which is of special interest for astronomical observations
of M dwarfs (Reiners et al. 2010).

Because pure Th cathode lamps are currently not available,
and there are no line-lists available for alternative cathode ma-
terials, wavelength calibration of optical spectrographs becomes
increasingly diﬃcult. We explore if U can also be an alternative
for the established Th cathodes in the wavelength range from
500 to 1000 nm (like in the NIR as proposed by Redman et al.
2011). Uranium cathode HCLs are made of natural U with
isotope abundances 238U ∼ 99.3% and 235U ∼ 0.7% and a
few additional isotopes with abundances smaller than 0.01%
(Rosman & Taylor 1998). These isotopes may contribute to
lines we identify as U lines as well as to the unidentiﬁed lines
found in our spectra. However,
the second most abundant
isotope, 235U is hyperﬁne-structured. Therefore, the expected
line intensities are low and the contribution to the observed U
spectra can be neglected (Redman et al. 2011). We devote this
work to the performance comparison between the currently
available Th and U lamps and present a uniform U line-list
spanning the wavelength range from 500 to 1700 nm.

In Sect. 2, we explain our experimental setup and our FTS
instrument used to take high resolution spectra of the hollow
cathode lamps. In Sect. 3, we identify spectral features in the
spectra of four HCLs: U-Ne, U-Ar, Th-Ne, and Th-Ar. Then,
we match the features with previously published line-lists and
determine the emitting element of the lines found in our spectra.
In Sect. 4, we discuss the performance of each of the four lamps.
In Sect. 5, we brieﬂy discuss the ﬁnding of molecular bands
in the spectra of the Th-Ar lamp. Because HCLs are replaced
on a regular basis in observatories, a similar performance
for lamps of the same type is desired. In Sect. 6, we test 12
individual U-Ne lamps to identify how large the diﬀerences be-
tween lamps of the same production batch can be. Finally, our U
line-list is presented in Sect. 7. Section 8 summarizes our results.

2. Experimental setup and measurements

The lamps used in this work are currently used in the Calar
Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with
Near-infrared and optical Échelle Spectrographs (CARMENES)
(Quirrenbach et al. 2014) calibration unit. For this purpose 12
identical U-Ne lamps were ordered from Photron PTY Ltd.1.
The HCLs belong to the same batch and have consecutive serial
numbers (to ensure that they were built in a similar process). To
record high quality spectra and operate the lamps safely, HCLs
must be placed in a housing. It was designed and built by the

Thüringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg workshop.

To feed the light from the glowing cathode into the spectro-
graph (via a ﬁbre) we used the fore-optics shown in Fig. 1. It
consists of: L1, a doublet to collimate the light from the cathode
located at a distance to the lamp front window (LL1) of 35.5 mm;
a second doublet L2, located at a distance to the doublet L1
of 60.3 mm (LL2), which feeds the light into the ﬁbre using a
SM1SMA-SMA ﬁbre adaptor. The distance LL3, between the
doublet L2 and the ﬁbre adaptor is 75 mm (for further details see
the caption of Fig. 1). We connected a power-meter to the ﬁbre
port to have a simple method for aligning and focusing the light
source.

Fig. 1. Light from the HCL is coupled into a ﬁbre using a set of optics:
two doublets designated by L1 (AC254-125-B-ML from Thorlabs1), L2
(AC254-075-B-ML from Thorlabs1), and a SM1SMA-SMA ﬁbre adap-
tor. The text provides further details.

We equipped our FTS source chamber with a 8:92 (R:T)
Thorlabs1 pellicle beam splitter and a photodiode. The beam
splitter reﬂected 8% of the incident light into a photodector,
which measured the ﬂux with a frequency of 1 kHz. Simultane-
ously, we measured the operational voltage of the lamp using a
Universal Serial Bus (USB) voltmeter with a frequency of 2 Hz.

Figure 2 shows the measured voltage (blue) and ﬂux (brown)
during 20 min after switching on one of our lamps. The changes
in both parameters, voltage and ﬂux, indicate that the HCL needs
a warmup time to produce a stable output. To analyse these
changes, we ﬁrst averaged the voltage and ﬂux measurements
every minute. In a second step, we calculated the slope of
the relative voltage variation and the relative ﬂux variation of
the averaged values. The changes in ﬂux were less than 0.5%
after 7 min. However, we observed changes in voltage within
approximately 14 min, before the voltage reached a stability of
0.05%. Therefore we recommend a minimum warm-up time of
the Photron HCLs of 15 min to get the most stable output (see
Fig. A.1 in Appendix A).

We recorded the spectra of the lamps using our IFS125HR
FTS. In Table A.1 (Appendix A), we summarize the resolution,

number of scans, and operational current used for the diﬀerent
experiments. To obtain high quality spectra that cover the full
CARMENES spectral bandwidth from 500 to 1700 nm (from
20000 cm−1 to 5882.4 cm−1), we used two diﬀerent setups. For
the following, we call the ﬁrst setup the visible (VIS) one. We
recorded spectra from 500 to 1000 nm (from 20000 cm−1 to
10000 cm−1) using a quartz beam splitter and a silicon diode
detector. The second setup, called the NIR setup, was used to
record spectra from 1000 to 1700 nm (from 10000 cm−1 to
5882.4 cm−1). The NIR setup consists of a calcium ﬂuoride
beam splitter and an InGaAs detector.

Our FTS uses a frequency-stabilized HeNe laser (at a
wavelength of 632.816 nm in air, equivalent to 15802.382 cm−1)
to obtain the internal wavenumber solution by measuring the
optical path diﬀerence of the interferometer during the mirrors
scanning. A fraction of the laser light is reﬂected during its
path and also enters the detector. Hence, the VIS FTS spectra
used for this work are strongly contaminated by the laser in
the region between 610 and 655 nm (from 16393.4 cm−1 to
15267.2 cm−1). Therefore, we are less sensitive to weak spectral
lines in the contaminated range, and we can only detect the
strongest emission lines in our spectra.

3. Line search, line identiﬁcation, and spectrum

calibration

3.1. Identiﬁcationof line candidates

The sensitivity of the FTS in combination with the HCL
light source yields a low signal to noise ratio (SNR) spec-
trum in single scans. To increase the signal, we averaged over
a high number of individual scans (see Table A.1 in appendix A).

To quantify the noise level of the spectrum, we excluded
the points with the highest intensities (10%) and calculated
the standard deviation and the mean of the remaining signal;
we deﬁned our noise level as µ + (3 × σ). Next, we deﬁned a
wavenumber bandwidth of 0.09 cm−1 around each point with
intensity higher than the deﬁned noise levels, and selected
the data points that have a continuous ﬁrst derivative centred
on the zero crossing and ﬂagged them as "detected line". We
excluded the points with intensities lower than the noise level to
determine better line parameters. Finally, we ﬁtted a Gaussian
curve to each emission line and calculated the centre of the line,
the maximum intensity, and the full width at half maximum
(FWHM). To estimate the uncertainties of these parameters, we
ﬁrst obtained the statistical uncertainties of the ﬁtted parameters
from the covariance matrix. We then applied error propagation
to calculate the uncertainties of the centre of the lines, their
maximum intensity, and the FWHM.

3.2. Linesfound in the literature

To determine the emitting element for the detected lines, we ﬁrst
looked for a match of these lines with a line in the literature.
Next, we conﬁrmed the line identiﬁcation by analysing the
FWHM of the line.

We calculated the wavenumber diﬀerence between the line
position of our detected lines and lines from the R2011 line-list
to identify U lines, and the R2014 line-list to identify Th lines.

Article number, page 3 of 14

 
 
A&Aproofs: manuscript no. HCL_U_Th_Ull_S2018

We used the NIST line-list (Kramida et al. 2015) to identify Ne
and Ar lines. Detected lines that match a line position listed in
the line-lists within three times its estimated position uncertainty
were ﬂagged as "conﬁrmed" lines.

Lines emitted by the metallic material of the cathode (either
U or Th) and the lines emitted by the HCL’s ﬁlling gas (either
Ne or Ar) have very diﬀerent widths (Doppler broadening) be-
cause of their diﬀerent atomic weight (Th:232 u, U:238 u, Ne:20
u, Ar:40 u). Hence, the lines emitted by U or Th are narrower
than the lines emitted by Ne or Ar. The possibility that the lines
emitted by the buﬀer gas and the cathode have diﬀerent FWHM
is used to conﬁrm the line identiﬁcation done by matching the
line position. In Fig. 3, we show that the FWHMs of metal and
gas lines diﬀer signiﬁcantly between U and Ne lines found in our
NIR spectrum.

Fig. 3. FWHM of conﬁrmed U (blue dots) and conﬁrmed Ne (red dots)
lines in the spectrum of one of our U-Ne lamps.

We ﬁtted the FWHM of the conﬁrmed lines as a function
of wavenumber and used this information to determine the
emitting element for the remaining detected lines in Sect. 3.3.
We computed the residuals to the ﬁt and calculated the standard
deviation of the residuals. Lines with residuals higher than three
times the standard deviation were ﬂagged as blends, while lines
with residuals smaller than three times the standard deviation
were ﬂagged as "isolated" lines.

Before classifying the lines that were not found in the
literature, we searched for the traces of additional contaminants
that might be present in our recorded spectra. We matched
the line position of the unidentiﬁed lines with the lines in the
line-lists of Ne (in lamps where Ar is used as the ﬁlling gas), Ar
(in lamps where Ne is used as the ﬁlling gas), N (because it is
the most abundant gas in the atmosphere), and Zr (because it is
used in the lamps tested here to trap molecules sputtered from
the cathode) that were downloaded from the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) database (Kramida et al.
2015). We did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant gas contamination in
our measurements. As a result of the ﬁrst line identiﬁcation
analysis, 87% of the emission lines remained unidentiﬁed in the
VIS spectrum, and 50% in the NIR spectrum (see Table A.3 and
Table A.4 in Appendix A). In Sect. 3.3, we attempt to classify
the large number of remaining unidentiﬁed lines to build a list
of U line candidates.

3.3. Identiﬁcation of new U linecandidates

Since we found a large number of unidentiﬁed lines in our
spectra, we are interested in identifying the lines emitted by the

Article number, page 4 of 14

metallic cathode. In a ﬁrst step, we selected those lines from the
"unidentiﬁed detected lines" that have measured FWHM smaller
than the conﬁrmed Ne lines. Next, we checked that those lines
are in line with the ﬁtted FWHM(ν) relation determined from
the conﬁrmed U lines. The lines that matched both criteria were
ﬂagged as "U line candidates". To conﬁrm the nature of the U
line candidates, we will examine the lines further in Sect. 7.
In that section, we will analyse the line intensity, operating the
lamps at diﬀerent currents to conﬁrm the emitter element (as in
Kerber et al. 2007).

3.4. Spectrum calibration

3.4.1. Wavenumber calibration

Our FTS wavenumber solution is based on an internal frequency-
stabilized He-Ne laser. The laser is used to measure the opti-
cal path diﬀerence of the interferometer during measurements.
Any misalignment between the light path of the science light
and the internal laser combined with the limited size of the FTS
entrance aperture introduces a linear compression or stretch of
the instrument wavenumber scale (Griﬃths & de Haseth 2007).
We corrected for this eﬀect using eight U and seven Th stan-
dard lines between 694 and 755 nm (Degraﬀenreid & Sansonetti
2002). The wavenumber of the standard lines was measured with
an accuracy of the order of 10−8 (0.0002 cm−1), which is one or-
der of magnitude higher than the accuracy of our measured line
positions (10−7). The wavenumber correction factor was calcu-
lated for each standard line i as

ki =

˜νstd,i
˜νobs,i

− 1,

where ˜νstd,i is the standard wavenumber of line i and ˜νobs,i is
our measured wavenumber. We calculated the weighted average
of the correction factor of all the lines to obtain the spectrum
wavenumber correction factor k. To convert the FTS wavenum-
ber scale into an absolute scale, we computed

˜νc = (1 + k) × ˜νFT S ,

where ˜νFT S is the internal FTS wavenumber scale and ˜νc is the
corrected wavenumber scale.

We obtained kVIS = (1.4 ± 0.1) × 10−7 for the spectrum mea-
sured in the VIS band. No Th or U standard lines are available
similar to the ones of Degraﬀenreid & Sansonetti (2002) for
our NIR setup. Therefore, we used 21 conﬁrmed and isolated,
high intensity U lines that we found in the wavelength region
where our VIS setup and NIR setup overlap to cross calibrate
our two setups. The errors estimated for these lines in the VIS
spectrum are of the order of 0.001 cm−1. Hence, each single line
can be measured with a precision comparable to the expected
wavenumber correction (see Fig. A.3). Using the weighted
average of the 21 ki, we obtained kNIR = (−2.85 ± 0.9) × 10−7.
We noted that the higher uncertainty of the kNIR was a re-
sult of using the 21 absolute calibrated lines from the VIS
setup, which are less accurate than the standards lines of
Degraﬀenreid & Sansonetti (2002) used to calibrate the VIS
spectrum.

3.4.2. Flux calibration

We calibrated the line intensity for the spectral response of the
FTS and the fore-optics. For this, we recorded a low resolution
spectrum of a calibrated tungsten lamp (with a black body
temperature of 3000 K). We applied a moving average to obtain
the continuum of the spectrum and divided the continuum curve
by the theoretical black body curve of the lamp. We identiﬁed
the calculated curve with the spectral response of the setup.
The line intensity of each line was corrected by dividing the
calculated line intensity by the spectral response curve.

4. Cathode and buffer gas elements selection

In this section, we characterize U-Ne and U-Ar lamps and
compare them with Th-Ne and Th-Ar lamps (from 500 to
1000 nm). Since the number of Th lines is known to drop signif-
icantly beyond 1000 nm (Redman et al. 2014), we restricted our
analysis for the NIR setup (from 1000 to 1700 nm) only to the
U-Ar and U-Ne lamps.

To characterize all lamps, we quantiﬁed the number of
isolated metal and gas lines and analysed their spectral distri-
bution. Another important characteristic of HCLs when used
in astronomical spectrographs is that high intensity lines can
produce saturation eﬀects in the cgarge-coupled device (CCD).
These lines are mostly emitted by the buﬀer gas of the HCLs.
Therefore, the number of these high intensity lines and their
spectral distribution should be identiﬁed.

4.1. Analysis in the VIS

We systematically analysed the metal and gas lines of U-Ar, U-
Ne, Th-Ar, and Th-Ne HCLs using the VIS setup. We averaged
200 scans per lamp taken under the same conditions (same imag-
ing fore-optics and 12 mA operational current) at a resolution
of 0.03 cm−1. For our analysis, we identiﬁed the metal (U and
Th) and buﬀer gas (Ne and Ar) lines emitted by all four HCLs
as explained in Sect. 3.2. The number of conﬁrmed metal and
gas lines in all four lamps is summarized in Table 1. In the last
column of Table 1, we show the number of "high intensity gas
lines", which we deﬁne as the gas lines with intensities higher
than the most intense metal line.

In the second column of Table 1, we see a larger number
of conﬁrmed lines in the U HCLs than in the Th HCLs. The
number of conﬁrmed isolated U lines in the U-Ar spectrum
(1998) is slightly larger than in the U-Ne spectrum (1899),
but both numbers are still comparable. However, they are very

diﬀerent for the Th lamps: while we identify 1436 isolated Th
lines in the Th-Ar lamp spectrum, we only ﬁnd 938 isolated Th
lines in the spectrum of the Th-Ne lamp. Comparing the Th-Ar
and U-Ar lamps we observe the same number of conﬁrmed high
intensity Ar lines in both spectra. However, when we compare
the number of conﬁrmed high intensity Ne lines in the Th-Ne
with the U-Ne lamps, we ﬁnd signiﬁcantly fewer strong Ne lines
in the U-Ne lamp.

Besides the total number of metal

their spectral
distribution is also important, as explained in Sect. 1. Therefore,
we plot the histogram of the number of conﬁrmed metal lines as
a function of wavelength in Fig. 4 for all four lamps. We also
indicate the conﬁrmed high intensity gas lines as vertical lines.

lines,

We ﬁrst discuss the upper panel of Fig. 4 by comparing the
Th-Ar and Th-Ne lamps. We see that there are fewer conﬁrmed
Th lines in the Th-Ne lamp throughout the entire spectral range
of the VIS setup. The diﬀerence in the number of conﬁrmed Th
lines between Th-Ar and Th-Ne is relatively homogeneously
distributed. The number of conﬁrmed gas lines, however, is
comparable in both lamps (233 in Th-Ar and 231 in Th-Ne)
although the Ne lines show higher intensities than Ar lines.
Twenty-six of the Ar lines in the Th-Ar lamp are high intensity
gas lines. For the Th-Ne lamp we count 66 high intensity gas
lines, which is more than a factor of two higher than in the
Th-Ar lamp. It is interesting to note that high intensity Ne
lines are mainly emitted at wavelengths shorter than 750 nm,
while the high intensity Ar lines are emitted at wavelengths
longer than 695 nm. From the total number of Th lines and their
spectral distribution, we conclude that Th-Ar is a better choice
for wavelength calibration than Th-Ne for any spectrograph
operating in the range from 500 to 1000 nm.

After analysing the Th cathode lamps, we take a close look
at the lower panel of Fig. 4 and compare U-Ar with U-Ne. The
number of conﬁrmed Ne lines in the U-Ne spectrum (235) is
slightly higher than the conﬁrmed Ar lines (195) in the U-Ar
lamp. Moreover, we ﬁnd 43 high intensity Ne lines, which is a
factor of 1.6 larger than the number of high intensity Ar lines
(26). Most of the high intensity Ne lines are emitted at short
wavelengths (shorter than 750 nm) while Ar lines are mostly
emitted at wavelengths longer than 695 nm, as we previously
saw for the Th cathode lamps. We identify a slightly larger
number of conﬁrmed metal lines and a lower number of high
intensity lines and conclude that U-Ar performs better than
U-Ne HCLs in the VIS band.

After comparing lamps with the same cathode material, our
next goal is a comparison of diﬀerent cathode materials, Th and
U, regarding their usefulness for calibration purposes in the VIS
spectral range (from 500 to 1000 nm). The position of brighter
lines can be determined with higher accuracy, and a high number
of calibration lines in the spectra is desirable for computing the
wavelength solution of astronomical spectrographs. To account
for both, we deﬁne the quality factor of a lamp as the sum of all
line intensities in a given spectral range.

To compare lamps with this method, we normalized the
spectra by the intensity of the gas lines because the intensity of
these lines typically limits the exposure time of a detector. We
calculate the normalizing factor of the Ar HCLs spectra using
the 26 high intensity Ar lines identiﬁed in the U-Ar and Th-Ar
spectra, and the normalizing factor of the Ne HCL spectra

intense metal line) are overplotted. Argon lines are represented in blue and Ne lines in orange. In the top part, we indicate the spectral range
covered by the CARMENES VIS channel and HARPS (Mayor et al. 2003). The spectral region between the dashed lines (from 610 to 655 nm)
indicates where the internal laser of our FTS contaminates the recorded spectra. Upper panel: Th cathode HCLs (Th-Ne and Th-Ar). Lower

using the 43 high intensity Ne lines in the spectra of the U-Ne
and Th-Ne HCLs. After normalizing the spectra, the total line
intensity is computed over spectral ranges of 45 nm bins.

In Fig. 5 the uppel panel depicts the results of the HCLs
with Ar buﬀer gas and the bottom panel shows the results of the
HCLs with Ne buﬀer gas. The results from U-Ar and Th-Ar are
comparable in the ﬁrst two wavelength bins from 500 to 591 nm
and in the last two wavelength bins from 909 to 1000 nm. For
the rest of the VIS spectra (with the exception of the central
wavelength range from 636 to 681 nm), the U-Ar lamp clearly
outperforms the Th-Ar lamp. This is also reﬂected in the total
line intensity when summed over the entire VIS spectral range.
Overall, the U lines in the U-Ar spectrum exhibit 16% more
calibration light than the Th lines in the Th-Ar spectrum. For the
lamps with Ne buﬀer gas (bottom panel in Fig. 5), we see that
the total line intensity per spectral range is higher in almost the
entire VIS spectral range for the U-Ne lamp. The only exception
is the wavelength bin centred at 660 nm, where U-Ne and Th-Ne
are comparable. The total amount of light available in the U
lines of the U-Ne lamp is 222% greater than the total amount of
light available in the Th lines of the Th-Ne lamp.

From our results we conclude that, in the deﬁned VIS spec-
tral range (from 500 and 1000 nm), U HCLs are more suitable
for wavelength calibration of high resolution spectrographs than
Th HCLs. Among the U lamps, we identify a slightly higher
number of conﬁrmed isolated cathode lines in the U-Ar than
in U-Ne spectrum. Although both lamps show a considerable
number of ﬁlling gas lines, the high intensity gas lines are more
numerous and also brighter in the U-Ne HCL. The high intensity
lines can saturate the CCD of the spectrographs, which can
contaminate extended regions of the spectrum and make them
useless for wavelength calibration. Therefore, U-Ar lamps show

better properties than U-Ne HCLs for wavelength calibration.

To improve the wavelength solution in the spectral regions
of strong gas lines (Ar or Ne), one strategy is to use both the
U-Ar and U-Ne lamp independently. Uranium lines blended
with strong gas lines in one of the lamps will be uncontaminated
in the other because Ne and Ar emit lines in diﬀerent spectral
regions. The U lines found in both spectra can then be combined
and used for wavelength calibration. This strategy is currently
used in the VIS channel of the CARMENES spectrograph.

4.2. Analysisin the NIR

After analysing the VIS setup, we performed the same analysis
for U-Ne and U-Ar HCLs in the NIR wavelength range (from
1000 to 1700 nm). We averaged 200 scans taken at a resolu-
tion of 0.02 cm−1 while the lamps were operated at 12 mA. We
started by identifying the U and buﬀer gas lines. The number of
conﬁrmed U and Ne lines, and the high intensity gas lines found
in the two spectra, are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2. As in Table 1, but for U cathode lamps.

From Table 2, we can see that the number of conﬁrmed
U lines in the U-Ne HCL (1538) is slightly higher than in the
U-Ar lamp (1480). Although we identify a similar number of
conﬁrmed gas lines (188 Ne and 179 Ar lines), the number of
high intensity Ar lines (31) is about a factor of two larger than

the number of Ne lines (15).

We plot the histogram of the number of conﬁrmed U lines
as a function of wavelength in Fig. 6. We overplot the high
intensity lines emitted by the buﬀer gas of the lamps as vertical
lines.

As seen in Fig. 6, the metal line distributions of both lamps
are fairly comparable. We can see a small dip of the line density
around 1100 nm as a result of the lack of sensitivity in the
instrument used to prepare the R2011 line-list that is used to
identify U lines in this section (as explained in Sect. 1). It is
interesting to note that the number of high intensity gas lines in
the astronomical Y, J, and H bands (indicated in light yellow in
Fig. 6) is higher in the U-Ar HCL than in the U-Ne.

Since the number of metal lines and their distribution are
comparable, but the number of high intensity gas lines is lower
in the U-Ne lamps, we conclude that for the spectral range
between 1000 and 1700 nm, U-Ne HCLs are more suitable
for wavelength calibration of high resolution astronomical
spectrographs than U-Ar HCLs.

5. Molecular contamination

In the analysis described in the Sect. 4 we explained that we
did not detect signiﬁcant molecular contamination from other
species. Nevertheless, we did ﬁnd seven molecular bands dis-
tributed from 612 to 947 nm of the Th-Ar lamp spectrum (see
Table 3). These molecular bands are a source of noise for wave-
length calibration. In the case of the Th-Ar HCL, they can con-
taminate up to 7.64 nm (e.g. molecular band identiﬁed from
897.42 to 905.06 nm) of the spectrum. In Fig. 7, the molecular
band identiﬁed from 689.61 to 691.56 nm is shown as an exam-
ple. We observed these features in the new Th-Ar HCLs; we did
not ﬁnd any similar features in our U lamps and Th-Ne HCL.

spectrum recorded using the VIS setup. We deﬁne λs and λe as the start
and end wavelength (measured in vacuum) of the molecular band.

6. Comparison of 12 U-Ne HCLs

HCLs can show diﬀerent properties depending on the manufac-
turer and the manufacturing procedure. The number of emission
lines, line intensity ratio between metal and gas lines, and buﬀer
gas contamination have an eﬀect on the performance of HCLs
as wavelength calibrators. We analysed the consistency of these
characteristics for 12 U-Ne HCLs with the NIR setup. All lamps
are from the same batch and have consecutive serial numbers.
For each lamp we co-added 120 individual scans at a resolution
of 0.035 cm−1. The lamps were operated at 6 mA resulting
in lower SNR spectra than in the previous sections. We ﬁnely
aligned each lamp before its measurement with a power-meter
(see Sect. 2).

First, we searched for U and Ne lines, and for gas con-
taminants in the lamps as explained in Subsection 3.2. We
did not identify any signiﬁcant gas contamination from other
species in any of our spectra. Second, we selected the lines with
intensities above a deﬁned threshold (ten times the noise level).
We summarize the results in Table 4. We ﬁnd that the number
of U i lines diﬀers considerably for diﬀerent lamps (e.g. in the
lamp 0127 we ﬁnd a factor of 1.8 more lines than in the lamp
0120). The number of U ii, Ne i, and Ne ii lines is essentially

We looked for the conﬁrmed lines that can be found in all of
the 12 spectra to systematically analyse the diﬀerence between
the 12 lamps. In total, we detected 222 U i and 104 Ne i lines
in the spectra of all lamps. We normalized the 12 spectra to the
the sum of the Ne lines intensities averaged in each spectrum.
Then we divided the line intensity of each U line by the average
line intensity of this line in the 12 spectra. Last, we calculated
the average of the normalized line intensity of the 222 U i lines
(named IU in Table 4) for each lamp.

In Fig. 8 we plot

the normalized line intensity of the
common U i lines in the NIR spectral range for seven HCLs
(for readability reasons). The dashed lines represent IU for each
HCL. From Fig. 8 and Table 4 it can clearly be seen that IU
varies signiﬁcantly between the lamps. Lamps with the lowest
U line intensities are HKH0120 and HKH0122. Lamps with
the highest U line intensities are HKH0127 and HKH131. The
maximum U line intensity diﬀerence is 88% (with respect to
the minimum value), measured between lamps HKH0127 and
HKH0120.

 
L. F. Sarmiento et al.: Comparing the emission spectra of U and Th hollow cathode lamps and a new U line-list

A possible explanation for the observed behaviour of the
HCLs could be a diﬀerent geometry of the lamps or in the light-
ﬁbre coupling eﬃciency, as seen in Huke et al. (2016). This
could aﬀect the gas-metal intensity ratio. Another explanation
could be that the metal line intensities are very sensitive to
the internal pressure of the buﬀer gas (Crosswhite et al. 1955).
Therefore, even small changes in pressure from lamp to lamp
would have an eﬀect on the metal line intensity. We conclude
that HCLs can show noticeable diﬀerences in number and
intensity of metal lines even if they are manufactured in a single
batch.

7. U line-list

We concluded in Sect. 4 that U cathode lamps are more suitable
for wavelength calibrators than Th lamps from 500 to 1700 nm.
To use HCLs as wavelength calibrators for high precision RV
spectrographs, the wavelength of the spectral lines must be
known with high accuracy and precision. We present a new
line-list for U (ranging from 500 to 1700 nm) that complements
that of R2011.

7.1. Line-list in the VIS

The VIS setup is used to record spectra from 500 to 1000 nm of
one U-Ne HCL operated at 6, 9, and 12 mA. The FTS is set to
a resolution of 0.03 cm−1 to record 1000 single scans that are
co-added. We identiﬁed the conﬁrmed isolated U and Ne lines
as explained in Sect. 3. The detailed number of lines found in
each step in the diﬀerent spectra is presented in Table A.3 in
Appendix A.

In Fig. 9, we plot the number of conﬁrmed U lines (i.e.
UI and UII), conﬁrmed Ne lines (i.e. NeI and NeII ), and U
line candidates, meaning that
line candidates with FWHM
comparable to the conﬁrmed U lines but no corresponding line
in the literature.

Fig. 9. Number of lines in the spectra recorded when the U-Ne HCL was
operated at 6, 9, and 12 mA using the VIS setup (from 500 to 1000 nm).
The subset of conﬁrmed U lines (with a corresponding line in the liter-
ature) is shown in blue. The subset of conﬁrmed Ne lines is shown in
red. We show the number of U line candidates in orange (line candidates
with line width comparable to the FWHM of the conﬁrmed U lines and
with no match in the literature).

In Fig. 9, we see a large increase in the number of conﬁrmed
U lines for higher operational currents while the number of
conﬁrmed Ne lines remains almost constant. In order to identify
a larger number of U lines, we looked at which of the detected

lines have widths comparable to the width of those U lines that
are already conﬁrmed. We identify 2314, 1533, and 525 lines in
the spectra recorded at 12, 9, and 6 mA respectively, and ﬂag
them as "U line candidates".

We carried out a second test to check whether our U line
candidates are in fact emitted from the U cathode. If so, we
expect the intensities of these lines to show a similar behaviour
with increasing operational current as the conﬁrmed U lines.
We created four data subsets: the conﬁrmed U lines with a line
match in the 6, 9, and 12 mA spectra (258 lines); the conﬁrmed
Ne lines with a line match in the 6, 9, and 12 mA spectra (194
lines); the U line candidates found in the 6, 9, and 12 mA spectra
(525 lines); and the U lines candidates found in 9 and 12 mA
spectra only (1533 lines). Next, we normalized the line intensity
of every line to its intensity at 9 mA. Lastly, we calculated the
weighted average and the weighted standard deviation of the
normalized line intensities for each data subset.

squares), 525 U lines candidates with a match in the 6, 9, and 12 mA
spectra (light brown diamonds), and 1533 U line candidates identiﬁed
only in the 9 and 12 mA spectra (brown diamonds). The error bars in-
dicate the weighted standard deviation. The red and blue dashed lines
indicate the approximate trend that follows the normalized averaged in-
tensity of the buﬀer gas and the cathode lines, respectively.

In Fig. 10, we plotted the weighted average and the weighted
standard deviation of the four data subsets as a function of
the operational current. First, we look at the line intensity of
the conﬁrmed U and Ne lines. We see that the line intensities
of these subsets show a diﬀerent growth rate for diﬀerent
operational currents (see Sect. 1). The line intensity of the U
line candidates subsets is consistent with the behaviour of the
conﬁrmed U lines. Because both the FWHM of the U line
candidates and their intensity-rise as a function of operational
current are consistent with the conﬁrmed U lines, we conclude
that the emitting element of these 1533 lines is indeed U.

We provide an online line-list with the line position mea-
sured in vacuum, the line intensity, and the emitting element
of all the conﬁrmed and the U line candidates. Its format is
explained in Table 5. In addition to the lines discussed above,
we ﬁnd 781 lines that have a FWHM that is consistent with
the FWHM of the conﬁrmed U lines. We included these 781
lines in the line-list with the ﬂag ’12’. We also ﬁnd six lines
with FWHM consistent with the width of the conﬁrmed U
lines without a corresponding Ritz wavelength. The R2011
line-list also contains these lines (where they are ﬂagged as ’?’).
We checked their line intensity-rise with diﬀerent operational

currents. They show a consistent behaviour with the conﬁrmed
U lines. We included these six lines in our line-list and ﬂagged
them as ’R2011?’.

In addition, we also observe a low number of lines in the region
from 600 to 700 nm. This spectral band is strongly contaminated
by the internal FTS He-Ne laser (see Sect. 2), which is why the
weaker spectral lines are likely missed.

We analysed the spectral distribution of the U lines. A uni-
form distribution of lines is desired when choosing a calibrator
lamp for astronomical spectrographs. We plot in Fig. 11 the
histogram for the number of lines as a function of wavelength of
the R2011 line-list (blue) and overplot the conﬁrmed U lines in
our work (Sarmiento et al. 2018, from now on S2018) contained
in R2011 (red) and the U line candidates (green). The shortest
wavelength in the R2011 line-list is 833 nm, which is the reason
why we identify U line candidates bluewards of this wavelength.

We overplot the conﬁrmed U lines of our work (S2018) in light red.
The U line candidates are denoted in green. The bin size in this plot is
constant at 25 nm.

When we compare the distribution of lines in the spectral
region where our FTS setup overlaps with that of R2011 (blue
and red histograms in Fig. 11), we observe that about 50 % of
the lines listed in R2011 are identiﬁed in our data. We attribute
this diﬀerence in the number of lines to the diﬀerent operational
current used in this work and R2011. While in R2011 the spectra
were taken with operational currents between 26 and 300 mA,
we used spectra taken at 6, 9, and 12 mA and therefore our
line-list is limited to the brighter spectral features.

The number of identiﬁed lines in our spectra (conﬁrmed +
U line candidates) decreases towards the blue and red end of the
VIS spectral range. We attribute this decrease in number of lines
to the spectral response sensitivity of our setup and instrument.

The spectrum of the U lamp does not show any extended
spectral region that is completely devoid of U lines. Overall,
the number of spectral lines per 25 nm bin is relatively constant
and varies only up to a factor of two in our line-list (except
for the bin most contaminated by the He-Ne laser centred on
637.5 nm). The overall number of calibration lines available and
their relatively uniform spectral distribution make U lamps good
candidates to calibrate astronomical spectrographs operating in
optical wavelength regimes.

We investigated possible systematics in the wavelength posi-
tions of our line-list using the R2011 line-list in the overlapping
spectral region from 833 to 1000 nm. The left panel of Fig. 12
shows the diﬀerence in line position between R2011 and our
work; the histogram in the right panel shows the distribution of
the residuals as a function of velocity units.

−0.12 ± 8.19m/s−1, where the uncertainty is calculated as the weighted
standard deviation plus the statistical error introduced by the standard
lines used for calibration.

In Fig. 12 we do not see systematics in our work when
comparing with the R2011 line-list. The mean diﬀerence
between the two line-lists is −0.12 ± 8.19m/s (weighted mean
and standard deviation). We conclude that the line positions in
our line-list are consistent with those in R2011 within the error
bars.

Our VIS line-list provides a total of 3480 U lines, of which
2320 lines are U line candidates. There are 2314 lines that are
not contained in R2011 because the line-list does not show
information in wavelengths bluewards of 833 nm (plus six U
line candidates that are ﬂagged as ’R2011?’). We conclude
that the even distribution and high abundance of lines render
U lamps excellent calibrators for both NIR and VIS range
spectrographs.

7.2. Line-list in the NIR

We recorded and co-added 450 single scans of the U-Ne lamp at
a resolution of 0.01 cm−1, using the NIR setup from 1000 nm
to 1700 nm (10000 cm−1 to 5882.4 cm−1). The U-Ne HCL was
operated at three diﬀerent operational currents 8, 10, and 12 mA
(see Table A.1 for further details). We detected and identiﬁed
the lines as explained in Sect. 3. In Fig. 13, we plot the number
of conﬁrmed lines and U line candidates in the NIR spectra.

conﬁrmed U lines found in all spectra (blue squares); 132
conﬁrmed Ne lines contained in all spectra (red squares); 137 U
line candidates found in all spectra (light brown diamonds); and
908 U line candidates identiﬁed in the spectra of 10 and 12 mA
(brown diamonds). We normalized the intensity of every line to
its intensity at 10 mA, and we calculated the weighted average
of the normalized line intensity of each data subset. We plot the
results in Fig. 15.

As in the VIS setup, we can see in Fig. 13 that the number of
conﬁrmed U lines increases substantially at higher operational
currents, while the number of conﬁrmed Ne lines remains con-
stant (see Sect. 1). We see a large number of U line candidates in
the three spectra. Since our NIR setup overlaps with the spectral
range of R2011, we compared the line position and intensity
of our U line candidates and the conﬁrmed U lines (i.e. with a
match in R2011 line-list). In Fig. 14 we plot the relative intensity
of the U line candidates (red dots) and overplot the conﬁrmed U
lines (blue dots) found in both the 10 mA and the 12 mA spectra.

Fig. 14. Relative line intensity of the U line candidates (red dots) and
the conﬁrmed U lines (blue dots) as a function of wavelength. The green
dashed lines indicate the spectral band from 1031 to 1139 nm, where
the R2011 line-list shows a lack of emision lines caused by the spectral
response of its spectrograph.

Two spectral regions in Fig. 14 are of special interest: (i)
in the range from 1031 to 1139 nm (indicated by the green
dashed lines), the R2011 line-list is lacking a number of lines
that we found in our spectra, and (ii) there are several narrow
bands between 1200 and 1400 nm where our spectra show U
line candidates that are close to strong Ar lines (see Fig. 6).

We carried out a second test to determine the emitting
element of our U line candidates following the methodology
indicated in Sect. 7.1. We ﬁrst created four data subsets; 1418

Figure 15 shows that the line intensities of both the con-
ﬁrmed U and Ne lines (blue and red squares, respectively)
show diﬀerent behaviour for diﬀerent operational currents. We
ﬁnd that the growth in line intensity of both sets of U line
candidates is consistent with the behaviour of the conﬁrmed
U lines. Because the FWHM of the U line candidates is also
consistent with the width of the conﬁrmed U lines, we conclude
that these 908 lines are U lines. We also ﬁnd 151 lines with
FWHM consistent with the width of the conﬁrmed U lines
(ﬂagged as ’?’ in R2011). For these lines, no corresponding Ritz
wavelength is available in R2011. We conﬁrm that these are U
lines because they show the same behaviour with operational
currents as the conﬁrmed U lines with Ritz wavelengths. We
included these 151 lines in our line-list with the ﬂag ’R2011?’.

We investigated possible systematics introduced by our NIR
setup using the R2011 line-list. The left panel of Fig. 16 shows
the diﬀerence in line position between our S2018 and the R2011
line-lists. There are no obvious systematic diﬀerences between
the two lists; higher intensity lines show less scatter than the
lower intensity lines. In the right panel of Fig. 16, the histogram
shows the distribution of the diﬀerences. The mean diﬀerence
between the two line-lists is −3.5 ± 11.0 m s−1 (weighted
mean and standard deviation), that is, the two distributions are
consistent within the uncertainties.

The spectral distribution of U lines in our line-list obtained
with the NIR setup is shown in Fig. 17 with U lines of the R2011
line-list (blue), of our conﬁrmed U lines (red), and of our U line
candidates (green). The U lines are distributed across the entire
NIR wavelength range rather homogeneously. Two spectral re-
gions stand out in Fig. 17 (see also Fig. 14): (i) from 1031 to
1139 nm, the R2011 line list contains relatively few lines; and
(ii) the spectrum is contaminated by high intensity Ar lines (see
Fig. 6). In the spectral region from 1031 to 1139 nm, our line-
list almost doubles the number of known U lines: in R2011, 424
U lines are listed between 1031 to 1139 nm. While we identify
847 lines in this band, 444 of them U line candidates. We see
a decrease in the number of lines in the spectral range around

As a product of our analysis, we presented a line-list for U
in the wavelength range 500–1700 nm. The catalogue contains
8239 unblended lines that we attributed to U. The line-list allows
the calibration of high resolution spectrographs with U cathode
lamps. It can be expected to improve the wavelength calibration
accuracy because of the larger number of lines, and it provides
an alternative to Th lamps also for visual light spectrographs.

8. Summary

This work presents the analysis of four HCLs with diﬀerent com-
binations of cathode material and buﬀer gas. We recorded spec-
tra of U-Ne, U-Ar, Th-Ne, and Th-Ar lamps, compared their per-
formance, and created a new U line-list for the calibration of high
resolution VIS and NIR spectrographs.

We found that in the VIS, the U lamps exhibited a signif-
icantly larger number of spectral lines than the Th lamps. For
the lamps ﬁlled with Ar, the diﬀerence was about 30 %. The dif-
ference was more severe in lamps ﬁlled with Ne. Here, the U
cathode provided about a factor of two more lines than the Th
cathode. The total number of lines was comparable for the two
U cathode lamps; the one ﬁlled with Ar showed about 5 % more
lines in the VIS wavelength range. This diﬀerence was very large
for the Th lamps where the lamp ﬁlled with Ar had about 50 %
more lines than the one ﬁlled with Ne.

Our analysis of the spectral line distribution demonstrated
that the combination of a U-Ne lamp and a U-Ar lamp can map
out the wavelength range of VIS spectrographs very eﬃciently.
This strategy can provide a high number of well deﬁned cath-
ode lines and mitigate the eﬀect of the pixel saturation because
the strong gas lines from Ar and Ne contaminate diﬀerent wave-
length ranges.

At NIR wavelengths, we only investigated U cathode lamps
because Th lamps are known to show fewer lines here. The U-
Ne and U-Ar lamps showed comparable performances that are
very useful for wavelength calibration. The Ne lamp spectrum
showed fewer strong lines and might therefore be preferred over
the lamps ﬁlled with Ar.
