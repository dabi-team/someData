Collisional excitation of light hydrides is important to fully understand the complex chemical
and physical processes of atmospheric and astrophysical environments. Here, we focus on the
NH(X3Σ−)-Ar van der Waals system. First we have calculated a new three-dimensional Poten-
tial Energy Surface (PES), which explicitly includes the NH bond vibration. We have carried out
the ab initio calculations of the PES employing the open-shell single- and double-excitation couple
cluster method with non-iterative perturbational treatment of the triple excitations [RCCSD(T)].
To achieve a better accuracy, we have ﬁrst obtained the energies using the augmented correlation-
consistent aug-cc-pVXZ (X = T, Q, 5) basis sets and then, we have extrapolated the ﬁnal values
to the complete basis set limit. We have also studied the collisional excitation of NH(X3Σ−)-Ar at
the close-coupling level, employing our new PES. We calculated collisional excitation cross sections
of the ﬁne-structure levels of NH by Ar for energies up to 3000 cm−1. After thermal average of
the cross sections we have then obtained the rate coeﬃcients for temperatures up to 350 K. The
propensity rules between the ﬁne-structure levels are in good agreement with those of similar colli-
sional systems, even though they are not as strong and pronounced as for lighter systems, such as
NH–He. The ﬁnal theoretical values are also compared with the few available experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

The study of inelastic collisions plays a relevant role
in the understanding of important processes in diﬀer-
ent ﬁelds, such as atmospheric and astrophysical chem-
istry and physics. In particular open-shell molecules are
crucial, being highly reactive compounds and interme-
diate in a large number of chemical reactions. A rele-
vant chemical species is the NH radical. This compound
serves as a prototype for other collisional studies involv-
ing open-shell molecules. Being diatomic it is also pre-
ferred for both experimental and theoretical scattering
studies, owing to its large rotational energy level spac-
ings. In addition, the magnetic moment of its 3Σ− elec-
tronic ground state, makes NH suitable for studies of ul-
tracold molecules1,2, because it can be easily thermalized
at low temperatures through collision with cold buﬀer gas
atoms. In the past, NH has been subject of many the-

oretical and experimental collisional studies in diﬀerent
electronic states and with a variety of perturbers, such
as the rare gases He3–10 and Ne11–13.

In our work we focus on the calculation of a new ab
initio 3D-averaged Potential Energy Surface (PES) and
collisional excitation for the NH(3Σ−)-Ar system. To our
knowledge, there are no theoretical scattering studies for
the ﬁne-structure excitation of NH(3Σ−) by Ar, while
there is only one experimental work performed by Dagdi-
gian 14, employing a crossed beam apparatus. However,
this experiment provides only relative collisional cross
sections up to the rotational level N =4 and no rate co-
eﬃcients are available.

The most recent PES is given by Kendall et al. 15.
They employed a combination of supermolecular and
intermolecular unrestricted Møller-Plesset perturbation
theory (UMPPT)16,17 and a selection of monomer-
centered basis sets augmented with bond functions. How-

 
 
 
 
 
 
ever, the NH bond length was kept frozen at 1.96 bohr.
Recent studies10,13,18,19 have proven that the use of a 3D
PES which takes into account molecular vibration leads
to more accurate results when employed in collisional ex-
citation studies of light hydrides by rare gases. Moreover,
inclusion of the bond vibrational motion makes it possible
to comprise excited vibrational states. Hence, we have
computed a new ab initio PES for the NH(3Σ−)–Ar van
der Waals complex including the NH bond vibration.

Then, we present the ﬁrst fully quantum close-coupling
(CC) calculations of rotational inelastic cross sections for
the NH(3Σ−)–Ar collisional system. In addition, we have
taken into account the spin-coupling splitting of the ro-
tational levels and we have included the temperature de-
pendence of the ﬁne-structure resolved rate coeﬃcients
in the ﬁnal results.

The paper is organized as follows: Sec. II covers the
calculation of the new NH–Ar PES and informations
about the bound states of the NH–Ar complex; in Sec.
III, we present the scattering calculations, including the
inelastic cross sections and rate coeﬃcients. In Sec. IV,
we compare the resulting cross sections with the avail-
able experimental data in Ref. 14. Conclusions are given
in Sec. V.

II. POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACE

The two interacting species are considered in their
ground electronic states NH(3Σ−) and Ar(1S). The
NH(3Σ−)–Ar van der Waals system has 3A(cid:48)(cid:48) ground elec-
tronic state. In this work, we used the Jacobi coordinate
system (see Fig. 1). The center of coordinates is placed
in the NH center of mass (c.m.), and the vector R con-
nects the NH c.m. with the Ar atom. The rotation of NH
molecule is deﬁned by the θ angle and the r coordinate
describes the NH bond length.

We performed the calculations for ﬁve NH bond
lengths r = [1.6, 1.8, 1.95, 2.15, 2.5] bohr which allows us
to take into account vibrational motion of NH molecule
up to v = 2. We have carried out ab initio calculations
of the PES of the NH–Ar van der Waals complex at the
partially spin-restricted coupled cluster with single, dou-
ble and perturbative triple excitations [RCCSD(T)]20,21
level of theory, using MOLPRO 2015 package22. In or-
der to determine the interaction potential, V (R, θ, r), the
basis set superposition error (BSSE) was corrected at
all geometries using the Boys and Bernardi counterpoise
scheme23:

V (R, θ, r) = ENH−Ar(R, θ, r)

where X is the cardinal number of the aug-cc-pVXZ basis
set, EX is the energy corresponding to aug-cc-pVXZ basis
set, ECBS is the energy extrapolated to CBS limit, A and
B are the parameters to adjust. We have carried out the
calculations for θ angle values from 0◦ to 180◦ in steps
of 10◦. R-distances were varied from 3.0 to 40.0 bohr,
yielding 52 points for each angular orientation. Overall
∼5000 single point energies were calculated for the NH–
Ar complex.

The basis functions dl+m−1
(cos(θ)) are Wigner rotation
functions, N is the total number of r-distances, and L is
the total number of angles. The analytic potential was
found to reproduce the calculated energies quite well: the
mean diﬀerence between the analytic ﬁt and the ab initio
computed interaction energies is less than 2% over the
entire grid.

Previous studies18 have shown that averaging of the
PES over corresponding vibrational level v leads to a
better agreement with experimental results than using
a purely two-dimension PES. The newly constructed
PES, which takes into account the stretching of the NH
molecule, can be averaged over any vibrational state, up
to v = 2. The averaging is done using the following for-
mula:

Vv(R, θ) = (cid:104)v(r)|V (R, θ, r)|v(r)(cid:105)

(5)

The NH vibrational wave functions |v(r)(cid:105) were those
computed in Bouhafs et al.13 that were evaluated using
a discrete variable representation (DVR) method27 from
ab initio calculations of the NH potential function using
the internally contracted multireference conﬁguration in-
teraction (MRCI)28 level and a large aug-cc-pV5Z atomic
basis set.

Figure 2 depicts the contour plot of our 3D PES aver-
aged over the ground vibrational state v = 0 as a function
of R and θ (hereafter refereed as 3D-ave PES). For this
weakly-bound system the global minimum in the inter-
action energy was found to be -104.138 cm−1 (R = 6.7
bohr, θ = 69◦).

Our study is in good agreement with the NH–Ar PES
previously published15. Kendall et al. 15 carried out
calculations for the NH–Ar interaction with the super-
molecular unrestricted Møller-Plesset (UMP) perturba-
tion theory and a combination of diﬀerent basis sets.
The NH intermolecular distance was ﬁxed at 1.95 bohr.

According to the authors the best results have been ob-
tained with the aug-cc-pVTZ(ext-b) basis set, augmented
with bond functions, and the global minimum is found at
R = 6.75 bohr and θ = 67◦, with a well-depth of -100.3
cm−1 and an uncertainty within the 5%. These values
are very close to our results for r = 1.95 bohr (R = 6.7,
θ = 67◦, 103.787 cm−1). Furthermore, the results of
our 3D-ave PES also agree well with those listed above,
conﬁrming the high accuracy of our study. The slightly
increased deepness of our well-depth is mostly due to
the use of CBS extrapolation, since the energy follows a
monotonic trend towards negative values, by approaching
the inﬁnite basis set limit. Figure 3 depicts the variation
of the angle at which occurs the minimum of the inter-
action potential, for diﬀerent NH bond distances. While
the equilibrium angle changes substantially over increas-
ing r, the R distance is always close to R = 6.7.

B. NH–Ar bound states and dissociation energy

Using the highly correlated 3D-ave PES described in
the previous section, we have computed the bound states
of NH–Ar complex using a coupled-channel approach,
as implemented in the BOUND program29. The bound
state calculations were performed for the main 14N and
40Ar isotopes.

As a ﬁrst step we performed bound state calculations
neglecting the NH ﬁne structure (i.e. NH was considered
as a closed shell molecule). The calculations were per-
formed with a propagator step size of 0.01 bohr, and the
other propagation parameters were taken as the default
BOUND values. The rotational basis includes the rota-
tional states with Nmax ≤ 10. The bound energy levels
of the NH–Ar complex computed with the 3D-ave PES
are listed in Table I. From the present calculations, disso-
ciation energy (D0) of the complex is 73.15 cm−1 which

-104.138R (bohr)θ (degrees)1.601.801.962.152.50r (bohr)50556065707580 (degrees)is slightly larger than the previously calculated value of
Kendall et al.15 (D0 = 71.5 cm−1). The diﬀerence (1.65
cm−1) can be mainly attributed to the diﬀerence between
the two NH–Ar PESs used in the calculations. Indeed,
the well depth of the 3D-ave PES considering the vi-
bration motion is slightly deeper (by few cm−1) than the
rigid rotor one of Kendall et al.15 and this diﬀerence leads
to a larger estimated value of the dissociation energy.

In order to derive the rotational constant of the NH–
Ar complex, we have ﬁtted the energies of Table I to the
rigid rotor expression: EJ = E0+BJ(J +1)−DJ 2(J +1)2
where J corresponds to the total angular momentum
of the complex. We have obtained for the rotational
and quartic centrifugal distortion constants, B = 0.1087
cm−1 and D = 0.000025 cm−1. Such estimates allow
generating the energetic structure of the complex and are
useful for the interpretation of future experimental spec-
tra. As a comparison, our rotational constant is in good
agreement with the value obtained by Jansen et al. 30,
i.e. B=0.1007.

As previously mentioned, the NH molecule exhibits a
ﬁne structure because of the coupling between the rota-
tional angular momentum and the electronic spin. The
BOUND program was modiﬁed to include this ﬁne struc-
ture of the NH molecule10. Table II presents the bound
state energies for the ﬁrst total angular momentum J.
The predicted bound energy levels indicate that the cou-
pling of the electron spin to the rotational motion of the
complex is very weak. As a consequence, energy levels
of NH–Ar are very similar to those obtained by neglect-
ing the ﬁne structure, as already found for the NH–He
complex10. The dissociation energy is thus not signiﬁ-
cantly impacted by the ﬁne structure.

SCATTERING CALCULATIONS

Rotational transitions in the NH(3Σ−) electronic
ground state show ﬁne-structure splitting, due to spin-
rotation coupling. The rotational wave function of NH
for j ≥ 1 in the intermediate coupling scheme can be

(6)

where |N, Sjm(cid:105) denotes pure Hund’s case (b) basis func-
tions and the mixing angle α is obtained by diagonalisa-
tion of the molecular Hamiltonian. In this relation cor-
responding to the Hund’s case (b), the total molecular
angular momentum j is deﬁned by:

j = N + S

(7)

where N and S are the nuclear rotational and the elec-
tronic spin angular momenta. In the pure case (b) limit,
α → 0, the F1 level corresponds to N = j − 1 and the F3
level to N = j + 1. The levels in the spin multiplets are
usually labeled by the nuclear rotational quantum num-
ber N and the spectroscopic index Fi. This notation will
be used hereafter.

Using the new 3D-ave PES, we have studied the col-
lisional excitation of NH by Ar. The scattering calcula-
tions were performed for the main 14N and 40Ar isotopes.
The detailed description of the Close-Coupling (CC) cal-
culations that consider the ﬁne structure levels of the col-
liders is given in Ref. 32. The quantal coupled equations
have been solved in the intermediate coupling scheme us-
ing the MOLSCAT code33 modiﬁed to take into account
the ﬁne structure of the rotational energy levels.

We used a total energy grid with a variable steps.
For the energies below 500 cm−1 the step was equal
to 1 cm−1, then, between 500 and 1000 cm−1 it was
increased to 2 cm−1, and to 20 for the interval 1000-
3000 cm−1. Using this energy grid, the resonances (shape
and Feshbach) that usually appear in the cross sections
at low energies were correctly represented.

In order to ensure convergence of the inelastic cross sec-
tions, it is necessary to include in the calculations several
energetically inaccessible (closed) levels. At the largest
energies considered in this work, the NH rotational ba-
sis was extended to N = 12 to ensure convergence of
the rotational cross sections between levels with N < 8.
One also needs to converge inelastic cross sections with
respect to partial waves. The total angular momentum
quantum number J needed for the convergence was set
up to 238 for the inelastic cross sections.

5

Moreover,

in MOLSCAT,

it is necessary to adjust
the propagator’s parameters in order to ensure conver-
gence of cross sections calculations. For all the energies,
the minimum and maximum integration distances were
Rmin = 3.0 bohr and Rmax = 50 bohr, respectively. The
STEPS parameter was adjusted for each value of energy in
order to obtain a step length of the integrator suﬃcient
to achieve the convergence. In our work, the value of the
STEPS parameter decreases with increasing energy, going
from 50 to 7 and, therefore, constraining the R spacing
below 0.1-0.2 bohr at all energies. The reduced mass of
the NH–Ar system is µ = 10.912 u and the NH(3Σ−)
rotational and centrifugal distortion constants have been
taken from Ref. 34.

Figure 4 presents the energy variation of the integral
cross sections for transitions from the initial rotational
level N = 0, F1 of NH. The resonances shown at low col-
lisional energies are related to the presence of a ∼104
cm−1 deep attractive potential well. As a consequence,
the Ar atom can be temporarily trapped there forming
quasi-bond states before dissociation of the complex35,36.
However, excitation cross sections are less aﬀected and
therefore show few resonances. Indeed, the energy spac-
ing between rotational levels is generally larger than the
well depth of the PES.

The magnitude of the cross sections shown in ﬁgure 4

seems to present the following propensity rules:

(1) Overall decreasing of the cross sections with in-
creasing ∆N , according to the usual trend for rotational
In addition, even ∆N transitions are fa-
excitation.
vored over odd ∆N transitions as a consequence of near-
homonuclearity of the PES.

(2) Fine-structure conserving transitions are favored,

i.e. ∆j = ∆N in the case of pure Hund’s case (b).

The same propensity rules are shown in similar sys-
tems, such as NH-He and NH-Ne collisions8,10,13. In par-
ticular, the latter applies in general to molecules in the
3Σ− electronic state. Both porpensity rules have been
predicted theoretically37 and also observed for the O2-
He38,39 or SO(X3Σ−)–He32 collisions.

The rate coeﬃcients display the same propensity rules
as seen for the integral cross sections. In particular, the
rate coeﬃcients for F -conserving transitions are generally
larger than those for F -changing transitions.

IV. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS

Our new calculated cross sections can be compared
with the previous experimental results, obtained for a
collisional energy of 410 cm−1 and for rotational levels
up to N =4,F1 (Ref. 14). Tab.
III shows experimen-
tal and theoretical values normalized with respect to the
N = 0, F1 → N (cid:48) = 1, F1 cross section. The F -conserving
propensity rule is overall fullﬁlled in both the experimen-
tal and calculated values. In addition, the F -conserving
cross sections follow the simple scaling relation observed
by Dagdigian 14, as shown in Fig. 6. The main discrep-
ancy is the trend of the cross sections over increasing
∆N and over even/odd ∆N , as discussed for the ﬁrst
propensity rule in Sec.
III. Furthermore, according to
the results of Ref. 14, the largest cross sections are those
with N (cid:48) = 1, whereas this is not the case in our study. In
fact, larger values are related to the transitions involving
N (cid:48) = 2, as also shown in ﬁgure 4.

It is likely that these discrepancies are due to a partic-
ular feature of the experiment. In fact, as declared by the
author, the NH beam was not entirely pure, with 68% of
the population in the rotational ground state N = 0, F1,
and approximately 16% and 9% in the N = 1, F1 and
N = 1, F2 levels, respectively. By taking into account
this NH beam population composition, the propensity
rules observed in the experiment can be reproduced mak-
ing a convolution of the various cross sections involved.
This is shown in Tab. IV, which gathers values computed
using 68% contribution from inelastic cross section for
transitions out of the N = 0, F1, 16% from cross sections
involving the N = 1, F1, and 9% from those involving the
N = 1, F2.

It should be pointed out that there is a 7% population
with unknown distribution and thus the theoretical re-
sults obtained through convolution are still diﬀerent in

mass of the system and Ek is the translational energy.

coeﬃcients for temperatures up to 350 K is shown in

rules seen in other similar systems10,13, i.e. overall de-
creasing with increasing ∆N , even ∆N favored over odd
∆N and larger values for F -conserving transitions.

Our theoretical results have been compared to a pre-
vious experimental study14. The discrepancy concerning
the ∆N propensity rules can be explained with the impu-
rity of the NH population of the experimental molecular
beam, since we have been able to reproduce the results
of the experiment through convolution of various cross
sections, as discussed in Sec. IV.

We hope that our results will encourage new ex-
perimental studies concerning collisional excitation of
NH(3Σ−) by Ar.
In particular it would be interesting
to ﬁll the gap of missing data regarding Ar as a col-
lisional partner, with respect to systems involving He
or Ne, more widely studied. Furthermore, a complete
overview of these systems could also encourage studies
with ortho- and para-H2, highly important for astrophys-
ical environments.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

The supplementary material provides the analytic form
of the NH–Ar potential energy surface and the NH–Ar
collisional rate coeﬃcients.

V. CONCLUSION

We have computed a new highly accurate 3D PES for
the NH–Ar collisional system by taking into account the
stretching of the NH bond. We carried out these ab initio
calculations at the RCCSD(T) level and a complete basis
set extrapolation. The results are in good agreement with
the most recent PES available15.

Employing our new 3D-ave PES we have calculated the
dissociation energy of the NH–Ar van der Waals complex
and the corresponding rotational and centrifugal distor-
