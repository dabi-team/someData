Abstract  Superconducting  transition-edge  sensor  (TES)  microcalorimeters 
have great utility in x-ray applications owing to their high energy resolution, 
good collecting efficiency and the feasibility of being multiplexed into large 
arrays.  In  this  work,  we  develop  hard  x-ray  TESs  to  measure  the  absolute 
energies of muonic-argon (μ-Ar) transition lines around 44 keV and 20 keV. 
TESs with sidecar absorbers of different heat capacities were fabricated and 
characterized  for  their  energy  resolution  and  calibration  uncertainty.  We 
achieved ~ 1 eV absolute energy measurement accuracy at 44 keV, and < 12 
eV energy resolution at 17.5 keV.

1 Introduction  

The  muon  is  an  elementary  particle  with  the  same  electric  charge  as  the 
electron but 200 times more mass. When a muon is captured by a nucleus, a 
muonic  atom  is  produced.  Due  to  the  large  mass  of  the  muon,  the  Bohr 
radius  of  the  muonic  atom  is  1/200  as  large  and  subsequently  the  muon 
experiences an electric field 40,000 times stronger than that of an electron in 
the  normal  atom.  For  this  reason,  the  muonic  atom  is  a  good  system  to 
explore  quantum  electromagnetic  dynamics  (QED)  under  extremely  strong 
electric fields. One way of studying the QED effect in the muonic atom is by 
measuring  its  characteristic  x-rays  and  comparing  their  energies  with 
theoretical  predictions  [1].  The  measurement  requires  detectors  that  have 
both high collecting efficiency and high energy resolution [2], which makes 
the transition-edge sensor (TES) a good candidate.  

In order to calculate QED caused energy shifts of several tens of eV, this 
project  aims  to  measure  the  absolute  energies  of  muonic  argon  (μ-Ar) 
deexcitation at 44 keV and 20 keV with ~ 1 eV level accuracy. In previous 
work  [2],  we  designed  “sidecar”  TESs  with  different  numbers  of  bars  to 
adjust  thermal  sensitivity  and  absorbers  of  different  sizes  to  adjust  heat 
capacity. Saturation energies of 41 keV and 48 keV were obtained for TESs 
that have 4 pJ/K and 5 pJ/K absorbers, respectively. In the work described in 
this  paper,  we  continue  to  use  the  same  sidecar  layout  but  increase  the 
the  dynamic  range.

2 Experiment 

The TESs are 90 μm × 225 μm rectangular Mo-Au bilayers with 44 nm thick 
Mo  and  630  nm  thick  Au.  They  are  fabricated  with  a  hybrid  additive-
subtractive  process  [3].  The  critical  temperatures  of  the  TESs  are  95  mK, 
and the normal resistances are 6.3 mΩ. The absorbers are bilayers of 1.8 μm 
thick Au and 18 μm Bi. They are made into three sizes: 625 μm × 625 μm, 
685 μm × 685 μm, and 740 μm × 740 μm. Their heat capacities attributed to 
the Au portion at 100 mK are calculated to be 5 pJ/K, 6 pJ/K, and 7 pJ/K, 
respectively. The TES size is very small compared to the absorber size, and 
the  specific  heat  capacity  of  Bi  has  been  reported  to  be  two  orders  of 
magnitude smaller than that of Au [4]. Therefore, the total heat capacity of

these  devices  mainly  comes  from  the  Au  layer  in  the  absorber.  For  the 
convenience of naming, in this manuscript these prototypes are called 5 pJ/K, 
6  pJ/K,  and  7  pJ/K  pixels,  respectively.  We  test  pixels  with  different  heat 
capacities because the detector energy resolution value ∆E and the saturation 
energy  Esat  both  increase  with  C  [2].  Given  the  fact  that  TESs  are  not 
perfectly  linear  even  below  Esat,  a  larger  Esat  value  usually  means  that  the 
device  has  better  linear  performance  at  low  energies.  Because  the  absolute 
energy measurement accuracy improves with smaller ∆E and larger Esat, it is 
crucial that proper C is selected in order to balance ∆E and Esat.  

The  microcalorimeters  are  placed  in  an  adiabatic  demagnetization 
refrigerator  at  70  mK  bath  temperature  and  are  biased  at  10%  normal 
resistance.  Their  signals  are  read  out  by  microwave  superconducting 
quantum  interference  device  (SQUID)  multiplexers  via  a  pair  of  coaxial 
cables [5]. The SQUID bandwidth is 300 kHz, and the flux-ramp rate is 62.5 
kHz.  The  characterization  is  carried  out  at  Beamline-1BM-C,  Advanced 
Photon  Source,  Argonne  National  Laboratory,  USA.  We  use  78  keV 
synchrotron beam source to excite characteristic x-rays from Gd, Tb, and Dy 
foils. The three fluorescent materials are measured at the same time, so that 
their  x-ray  signals  have  the  same  drift  and  gain,  and  therefore  can  be 
corrected  simultaneously.  The  emission  energies  of  these  fluorescent 
materials are shown in Table I [6].

3 Result and Discussion 

Figure 1 shows the linearity feature of the three types of pixels. Each color 
represents  fluorescence  data  on  a  single  pixel.  Since  the  transition  edge  of 
the  TES  is  not  perfectly  linear  [7],  the  pulse  shapes  created  by  photons  of 
different energies are slightly different. As the saturation energy of the TES 
is  exceeded,  the  pulse  peak  flattens,  and  the  peak  amplitude  does  not 
increase with energy as much as the pulse area does, causing the scatter plot

shown in Fig. 1, the 5 pJ/K pixel starts to saturate around 50 keV, while the

52 keV measured range.

Title 

The  goal  of  energy  calibration  is  to  establish  the  relation  between  the 
photon energy E and the pulse height P. We calculate the pulse heights with 
the  optimal  filter  method  [8],  followed  by  the  correction  for  signal  gain 
variation that is caused by cryostat temperature drift [10]. Figure 2 shows the 
histograms of pulse heights of the six Kα1, Kα2 emission lines on a 6 pJ/K 
pixel. Owing to the thick Bi layer used in the absorber, a portion of photon 
events suffer partial energy loss [13, 14], which causes an exponential tail on 
the low-energy side of the measured spectrum. However, the low-energy tail 
effect is not observable in this measurement, due to the low statistics (~ 3000 
photons  per  peak)  and  the  large  peak  width  of  the  histograms.  The 
histograms  can  be  well  fitted  with  a  Lorentzian  function,  and  their  center 
pulse heights are calculated.  

There are several methods to construct the E vs. P relation. In this work, 
instead of interpolating the E vs. P data directly, we define the pulse gain as 
g  =  P/E  and  fit  with  P  vs.  g  values  [11].  The  6  pJ/K  and  7  pJ/K  data  are 
fitted with linear functions. The 5 pJ/K data shows a stronger nonlinear trend 
in  the  energy  range  of  interest,  and  is  therefore  fitted  with  a  quadratic 
function. In the calibration process, anchor points above and below the target 
energy are needed. Because the Tb Kα1, Kα2 lines are close to the 44 keV 
target project energy, we use Gd and Dy Kα1, Kα2 emission lines as anchor 
points and interpolate to find Tb Kα1, Kα2 line energies. The Kβ1 lines are 
not used in the calibration because of the large uncertainty (~  6 eV) in the 
reference values. Table II shows the deviation from the reference data of the 
calibrated energies of the three types of TESs. The energy deviation of the 6 
pJ/K  and  7  pJ/K  pixels  are  within  the  ~  1  eV  calibration  error.  These  two 
devices’  absolute  energy  measurement  accuracies  are  sufficient  for  the  44 
keV experiment.

the 5 pJ/K, 6 pJ/K, 7 pJ/K pixels are calculated to be 20.42 ± 1.39 eV, 20.30 
±  1.27  eV,  17.69  ±  1.11  eV,  respectively.  Theoretically,  ∆E  of  a  TES  is 
proportional  to  the  square  root  of  C.  However,  such  positive  correlation  is 
not  obtained  in  our  measurement  for  two  reasons:  1.  the  noise  across 
different TES channels varies, and we happen to have smaller noise on the 7 
pJ/K,  which  leads  to  its  better  energy  resolution;  2.  comparing  the  5  pJ/K 
and 6 pJ/K pixels, which have similar noise levels, the poorer linearity of the 
5 pJ/K can be the cause of the worse energy resolution.  

Fig.  3  Tb  Kα1,  Kα2  natural  line  shape  (dashed green lines),  emission lines 
(grey step histogram) and fittings (red lines) of different sizes of pixels.  

In order to evaluate the devices’ performance at ~ 20 keV, we measure 
the  17.5  keV  Mo  Kα1 fluorescence spectrum at NIST, and calculate that the 
∆E of the 5 pJ/K and 7 pJ/K pixels are 9.30 ± 0.34 eV and 11.50 ± 0.32 eV, 
roughly  proportional  to  the  square  root  of  C.  The  gain  scale  in  this 
calculation  is  determined  by  a  cubic-spline  interpolation  in  the  log(E)  vs. 
log(P)  space.  The  6  pJ/K  pixel  ∆E  was  not  measured  due  to  a  broken 
channel connection. Given the devices’ better energy resolutions at 17.5 keV, 
greater linearity at lower energies as shown in Fig. 1, and the availability of 
nearby  anchor  points,  the  calibration  uncertainties  of  these  devices  are 
expected to be smaller at 20 keV than those at 44 keV. Therefore, the 6 pJ/K 
and 7 pJ/K pixels satisfy the 20 keV measurement requirement as well. 

4 Conclusion 

We  developed  TES  microcalorimeters  for  μ-Ar  x-ray  emission  energy 
measurements at 44 keV and 20 keV. The TESs connect to sidecar absorbers, 
which are made of Au to set the device heat capacity and thick electroplated 
Bi  bilayers  to  increase  quantum  efficiency.  The  absorbers  have  heat 
capacities  of  5  pJ/K,  6  pJ/K,  and  7  pJ/K.  The  energy  resolutions  and 
calibration accuracies of the different devices have been characterized with 
fluorescence  spectra  on  individual  pixels.  We  achieve  absolute  energy
