∼

The MiniBooNE experiment reported results from the analysis of νe
and ν e appearance searches, which showed an excess of signal-like events
at low reconstructed neutrino energies with respect to the expected back-
ground. A proposed explanation for this anomaly is based on the existence
50 MeV) sterile neutrino. These νh would be produced by
of a heavy (
νµ electromagnetic and neutral current interactions. A fraction of them
decays radiatively inside the detector. The emitted photon is misidenti-
ﬁed as an electron or positron in MiniBooNE. We have investigated the
νh production by coherent and incoherent electroweak interactions at the
MiniBooNE and MicroBooNE targets, CH2 and Ar, respectively. Study-
ing the νh propagation inside the detector, we obtain the energy and
angular distributions of emitted photons for a choice of model parame-
ters. The distinctive shape and total number of photon events from this
mechanism at MicroBooNE makes its experimental investigation possible.

The paradigm of three mixing ﬂavors of neutrinos emerges from oscillation ex-
periments with solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrinos in which the
square-mass diﬀerences and mixing angles have been determined with ever growing
precision. Nevertheless, a number of anomalies that challenge this picture has been
observed. One of them, reported by MiniBooNE, has found an excess of electron-like
events over the predicted background in both ν and ν modes [1, 2]. The excess is con-
centrated at 200 < EQE
ν < 475 MeV, where EQE
is the neutrino energy reconstructed
assuming a charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) nature of the events.

ν

Existing analyses struggle to accommodate this result together with world oscilla-
tion data, even in presence of one or more families of sterile neutrinos [3], pointing at
an explanation that does not invoke oscillations. It was suggested that an underesti-
mated background from photons emitted in neutral current (NC) interactions could
account for the excess [4]. Indeed, the MiniBooNE detector does not distinguish be-
tween electrons and single photons. However, studies considering nuclear eﬀects and
acceptance corrections [5, 6], obtain a number of photon-induced electron-like events
which is consistent with the MiniBooNE estimate.

Gninenko proposed that additional photons could originate in the weak production
of a heavy (mh ≈
50 MeV) sterile neutrino slightly mixed with muon neutrinos,
followed by its radiative decay [7] In Ref. [8] it was pointed out that the νh could also
be electromagnetically produced, alleviating tensions in the original proposal with
other data such as those from radiative muon capture measured at TRIUMF.

We have revisited the scenario presented in Ref. [8]. We compute coherent and
incoherent νh production using present understanding of electromagnetic (EM) and
weak interactions on nucleons and nuclei. For a more detailed analysis, we compare
to the MiniBooNE excess of events in the originally measured electron energy and
angle [9] (being the photon ones in our case) rather than in EQE
. We also take into
account the experimental eﬃciency correction available from Ref. [9].

ν

Further insight on the nature of the MiniBooNE anomaly should be brought by
the currently running MicroBooNE experiment, capable of distinguishing between
electrons and photons. We have also computed the number of photon events from νh
for the target (Argon) and geometry of the MicroBooNE detector.

We have studied νh EM and weak production in the following processes

νµ , νµ(k) + N(p)

the nucleon, it is given in terms of electric and magnetic form factors (FF), for which
we have adopted standard dipole parametrizations. For coherent scattering (2), the
current is proportional to the nuclear FF, obtained as the Fourier transform of the
empirical charge density distribution. Finally, for the incoherent reaction we take into
account particle-hole excitations in inﬁnite nuclear matter, adapted to ﬁnite nuclei
using the local density approximation.

In the weak case, the neutrino vertex has the same structure as in the Standard

Our results for the integrated cross sections (cs) on protons and 12C, obtained
with mh = 50 MeV, µµ
2 = 0.003 [8], are given in Fig 1.
The EM cs on 12C is dominated by the coherent mechanism while the incoherent one
is suppressed by Pauli blocking at low q2, where the amplitude is enhanced by the
photon propagator [Eq. (5)]. On the contrary, the incoherent reaction is the largest
contribution to the weak cs. Similar features are observed for 40Ar target and also
for antineutrino beams.

We have then investigated the νh propagation, followed by their radiative decay
inside the detector, and obtained the photon energy and angular distributions. We
have taken advantage of the fact that, as pointed out in Ref. [8], the beam energies
are large compared to mh and only an insigniﬁcant amount of the electromagnetically
(weakly) produced heavy neutrinos have the spin against (aligned with) its momen-
tum. Radiative decay photons are emitted predominantly in the direction opposite
to the νh spin. The νh lifetime in its rest frame τ = 5

10−9 seconds [8].

Fluxes have been taken from Ref. [10]. To compare to the measured excess of events,
the detection eﬃciency [9] has to be taken into account. Being energy dependent and
low (at most 14 %), its impact on the number of events is signiﬁcant. The contribution
from the two protons in the target, coherent and incoherent scattering on 12C are
separately shown. The number of low energy events is underestimated in ν-mode,
while the agreement is good in ν-mode. The predominantly EM coherent contribution
is strongly forward peaked. This leads to a very narrow angular distribution not

The agreement can be improved by ﬁtting the parameters in the allowed range.
These results will be reported elsewhere [12]. The radiative decay hypothesis can be
tested at MicroBooNE. Our predictions for the photon distributions at this detector
1020 are displayed in Fig. 3. The shape
with the ﬂux in ν-mode [13] and NP OT = 6.6
and number of events appears distinctive from those of conventional mechanisms.
