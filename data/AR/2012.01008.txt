ABSTRACT

Active region (AR) 12673 produced many M-class and several X-class ﬂares, one of

which being an X9.3 ﬂare, which is recorded as the largest solar ﬂare in solar cycle

24. We studied the evolution of the three-dimensional ﬂare-productive magnetic ﬁeld

within AR 12673, using a time series of nonlinear force-free ﬁeld extrapolations of every

12 hours from September 4th 00:00 UT to 6th 00:00 UT. Our analysis found that three

magnetic ﬂux ropes (MFRs) are formed by September 4th, one of which produced the

X9.3 ﬂare on September 6th. One MFR has positive magnetic twist which is a diﬀerent

sign from other two MFRs. Since the temporal evolution of the magnetic ﬂux of the

MFR accumulating the positive twist is consistent with the proﬁle of the GOES X-

ray ﬂux well observed from September 4th to 6th, we suggest that the formation of

the MFR having the positive twist is closely related to the occurrence of the M-class

ﬂares including an M5.5 ﬂare. We further found a magnetic null in the magnetic ﬁeld

surrounding the MFRs, in particular, above the MFR having positive twist before the

M5.5 ﬂare which is the largest M-ﬂare observed during this period. By comparing with

the AIA 1600 ˚A images, we found that the footpoints of the overlying ﬁeld lines are

anchored to the area where the brightening was initially observed. Therefore, we suggest

that reconnection induced by the torus instability of the positively twisted MFR at the

null possibly drived the M5.5 ﬂare.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares are widely considered to be releases of the magnetic energy accumulated in the solar

corona. They are often observed in solar active regions (ARs) where the magnetic ﬁelds are highly

deviated from the potential magnetic ﬁeld that corresponds to the lowest energy state (Priest & Forbes

2002). Shearing and converging motions of the photosphere highly deform the coronal magnetic ﬁeld,

resulting in accumulated free magnetic energy. The magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR), which is a bundle of

helical magnetic ﬁeld lines, is formed in the lower corona via ﬂux emergence, photospheric motions,

and reconnection (van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989; Okamoto et al. 2008; Filippov et al. 2015;

Cheng et al. 2017). Since the MFR accumulates the free magnetic energy, it becomes a source of

solar eruptions. The eruption of the MFR drives magnetic reconnection, which plays an important

role in the energy release of the solar ﬂares (Shibata & Magara 2011), and coronal mass ejections

(CMEs; Chen 2011; Schmieder et al. 2015).

AR 12673 came at the end of August 2017 and was the most ﬂare-productive AR in solar cycle 24. It

produced many M-class ﬂares and several X-class ﬂares from September 2nd to 10th, among which

an X9.3 ﬂare was the largest, and produced a geo-eﬀective CME (Yan et al. 2018; Shen et al. 2018;

Chertok et al. 2018; Soni et al. 2020). AR 12673, at ﬁrst, appeared as a monopole sunspot observed

Evolution of the Non-Potential Field in AR 12673

at the east solar limb in August 29th. On September 3rd and 4th, two dipoles emerged beside the

pre-exisiting sunspot, and the AR evolved into the complex δ sunspots (Yang et al. 2017). During

the sunspot evolution in the AR, the negative polarity strongly intruded into the neighboring positive

polarity before the X2.2 ﬂare (Bamba et al. 2020), therefore this intrusion would play an important

role in causing the X-ﬂares. While these studies have been done, Inoue et al. (2018b) performed the

data-constrained magnetohydrodynamics simulation focusing on X-class ﬂares observed in September

6th, and proposed that the erupting magnetic ﬂux is formed by reconnection between twisted ﬁeld

lines existing above PIL before the ﬂares.

As we mentioned above, many studies focus on the evolution of the AR and the onset mechanisms and

dynamics of the X2.2 and X9.3 ﬂares in terms of observational and numerical approaches. However,

the overall evolution of the 3D magnetic ﬁeld in this AR and ﬂare activities before the ocurrence of the

X-class ﬂares are not investigated well. In this study, we investigate the evolution of the 3D magnetic

ﬁeld using a nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolated from the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld,

and discuss the initiation of M-class ﬂares observed before September 6th. We focus on the M5.5

ﬂare observed at 20:30 UT on September 4th. Since this ﬂare produced a geo-eﬀective CME, our

study is important also for the space weather forecaset. We eventually discuss a relationship between

the M-class ﬂare activities and the X-class ﬂares which come later.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: the observations and methods of analysis are described

in Section 2, results are presented in Section 3, and important discussions arising from our ﬁndings

are summarized in Section 4.

2. METHODS

2.1. Observation

As is shown in the GOES X-ray ﬂux proﬁle in ﬁgure 1 (a), AR 12673 produced 12 M-class ﬂares

between 2017 September 4th and 5th, prior to X9.3 on September 6th (Yang et al. 2017). In ﬁgure

1 (b), we show the extreme ultraviolet image of the whole Sun on September 6th 12:11 UT in

171˚A observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the

4

Yamasaki et al.

Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). In the ﬁgure, AR 12673 is highlighted by

the white box. Figure 1 (c) shows the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld of AR 12673, observed at

18:00 UT on September 4th taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al.

2012) on board the SDO. Details of the vector magnetic ﬁeld data reduction and other related

information about HMI data products can be found in Hoeksema et al. (2014) and Bobra et al.

(2014).

In this image, which was taken approximately 2 hours before the M5.5 ﬂare, 3 polarity

inversion lines (PILs) and the sheared magnetic ﬁeld lines along PILs can be identiﬁed.

2.2. Nonlinear force-free ﬁeld extrapolation

Current observations cannot measure the coronal magnetic ﬁeld directly. In order to obtain 3D

magnetic ﬁelds in the corona, we performed a nonlinear force-free ﬁeld extrapolation (Wiegelmann &

Sakurai 2012; Inoue 2016; Guo et al. 2017). NLFFF extrapolations are carried out under the following

assumptions: the plasma β in the solar corona is small (0.01-0.1), thus the gas pressure and gravity

can be neglected to the Lorentz Force. The time scale of photospheric motions are much longer than

that of the Alfven time scale, which characterizes the response time of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld,

so that the coronal magnetic ﬁeld approximately evolves under a quasi-static state. Therefore, the

evolution of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld can be approximated by a series of NLFFF. In this study, we set

the observed photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds, which are preprocessed according to Wiegelmann

et al. (2006), as the bottom boundary condition and calculated the 3D coronal magnetic ﬁelds to

satisfy the force-free state. The extrapolation is performed using the following procedure: we ﬁrst

calculate the 3D potential ﬁeld from the vertical component of the observed photospheric magnetic

ﬁeld according to Sakurai (1982). Next, we change the horizontal component of the bottom boundary

from the potential ﬁeld to the observed magnetic ﬁeld, after that the horizontal components perfectly

ﬁt to the observed magnetic ﬁeld. We continue the calculation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld with the

ﬁxed boundary condition until the ﬁeld converges to the state with the minimum deviation from the

force-free state. In this study, to obtain the force-free ﬁeld, we employ the MHD relaxation method

where ρ, B, v, J , and φ are plasma pesudo-density, magnetic ﬂux density, velocity, electric current

density, and a conventional potential to reduce errors derived from ∇ · B (Dedner et al. 2002). The

pseudo-density in equation (1) is assumed to be propotional to |B|. The Alfven velocity is uniform

for the density model ρ ∝ |B|2.

In these equations, the length, magnetic ﬁeld, density, velocity,

time, and electric current density are normalized by L∗ = 240.0 Mm, B∗ = 3000 G, ρ∗ = |B∗|, V ∗

A ≡

B∗/(µ0ρ∗)1/2, where µ0 is the magnetic permeability, τ ∗

A ≡ L∗/V ∗

A, and J ∗ = B∗/µ0L∗, respectively.

In equation (2), ν is a viscosity ﬁxed at 1.0×103. The coeﬃcients c2

h, c2

p in equation (5) are ﬁxed to the

constant values 0.04 and 0.1. The resistivity in equation (3) is given as η = η0 + η1|J × B||v|2/|B|2,

where η0 = 5.0 × 10−5 and η1 = 1.0 × 10−3 in non-dimensional units. As for the choice of these

parameters, see Inoue (2016). The second term of the resistivity is introduced to accelerate the

relaxation to the force-free state, particularly in regions of weak ﬁeld.

We use the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld obtained at 2017 September 4th 00:00 UT, 4th 12:00 UT,

4th 18:00 UT, 5th 00:00 UT, 5th 12:00 UT, and 6th 00:00 UT. In ﬁgure 1 (a), we indicate the time

of each NLFFF calculation with vertical black solid lines. Figure 2 shows the 3D coronal magnetic

ﬁeld in (a), the current density obtained from the NLFFF extrapolation in (c) and AIA images in

131 ˚A and 304 ˚A, respectively in (b) and (d) at 18:30 UT on September 4th. In the ﬁgures, the

extrapolated ﬁeld lines match those inferred from the AIA 131 ˚A image and also the distribution of

the current density is in good agreement with the intensity of the AIA 304 ˚A image. Therefore, we

conclude that the NLFFF extrapolation reproduces the observed ﬁeld lines well.

Evolution of the Non-Potential Field in AR 12673

We ﬁrst show the temporal evolution of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld in ﬁgures 3(a)-(c) and the

MFRs obtained from the NLFFF extrapolations are shown in ﬁgures 3(d)-(f). At September 4th

00:00 UT, the highly twisted ﬁeld lines come up according to the photospheric motion. Furthermore,

at 18:00 UT which is approximately 150 minutes before the M5.5 ﬂare peak time, we found an MFR

along each of the PILs.

In order to identify these three MFRs, we name MFR A, B, and C as

indicated in ﬁgure 3 (e) and use them in the rest of this paper. MFR A, which exists at the PIL

on the west side of the AR, where the X-class ﬂares were observed on September 6th (Liu et al.

2019), was already formed at 18:00 UT September 4th. Although the MFRs B and C still exist on

September 6th, they look to be relaxed compared to those in 4th. Therefore, we suggest that these

MFRs are involved in causing the M-class ﬂares.

3.1.2. Temporal evolution of the magnetic twist

We employ the magnetic twist, introduced by Berger & Prior (2006), Inoue et al. (2011), and Liu

et al. (2016) in this study because it is a convenient value to measure the twist of the ﬁeld lines in

each magnetic ﬁeld line quantitatively. The magnetic twist is deﬁned as

Tw =

(cid:90)

L

µ0J(cid:107)
4πB

dl =

(cid:90)

L

∇ × B · B
4πB2

dl.

(6)

We calculated the magnetic twist for each ﬁeld line obtained from the NLFFF.

Figure 4 shows the temporal evolution of the magnetic twist mapped on the photosphere. According

to the ﬁgires 3 and 4, the MFRs A and C are characterized by the negative twist, while the MFR B

has positive twist. The value of positive twist peaks at 00:00 UT on September 5th, after which it

seems to decrease. This result indicates that MFR B are formed at the site between the PILs where

the MFRs A and C reside.

In order to understand the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld more quantitatively, we plot the unsigned

magnetic ﬂux as follows,

F−(t) =

BZ(t)>0

Vemareddy (2019).

Next, we calculated the twist ﬂux, τ±, deﬁned as followings,

(cid:90)

τ+(t) =

|BZ(t)| · Tw(t) dS,

τ−(t) =

Tw(t)>0.35

(cid:90)

Tw(t)<−0.35

|BZ(t)| · Tw(t) dS.

(10)

(11)

This value is a proxy of strength of a MFR. Figure 5 (b) shows the temporal evolution of τ+ and

τ−. The evolution of τ− clearly shows a rapid evolution within a day and keeps a high value until

September 6th. However, although τ+ also grows within a day, it takes the peak at September 5th

00:00 UT, and decreases after that. We also compare the temporal evolution of τ+ with the GOES

Evolution of the Non-Potential Field in AR 12673

11

soft X-ray proﬁles in ﬁgure 5 (c). The evolution of τ+ well captures the evolution of the GOES ﬂux

as shown in a period from September 4th to 6th. In addition, we show the AIA 1600 ˚A image, the

spatial distributions of force-free alpha, and the magnetic twist around 20:30 UT on September 4th,

when τ+ increases, in ﬁgures 6 (b), (c), and (d), respectively. Here we note that force-free alpha

(α) was calculated with the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld obtained with the HMI according to

α = (∇×B)z/Bz. In the ﬁgures, we can clearly see that the sign of force-free alpha and the magnetic

twist show the similar distribution. Especially, around the MFR B, both force-free alpha and the

magnetic twist have positive sign. Additionally, the enhancement of AIA 1600 ˚A was observed at the

site of the MFR B. These results, from both modeling and observations, suggest that the evolution

of the MFR B having the positive twist is closely related to the occurrence of the successive M- and

C-class ﬂares.

3.1.3. Temporal evolution of the AIA 1600˚A observations along each PIL

In this section, we analyze the AIA 1600 ˚A image to identify the location of the ﬂares. From the

GOES plot, we see that 5 ﬂares greater than M2.0-class were observed from September 4th 18:00

UT to September 6th 00:00 UT. We show the results from three of them: M5.5 ﬂare observed at

20:30 UT September 4th, M4.2 ﬂare observed at 01:05 UT September 5th, and M2.3 ﬂare observed

at 17:40 UT September 5th. We divided the ﬂaring region into three areas along three PILs which

are surrounded by squares as shown in ﬁgures 7 (a), (c), and (e). We measure the intensity of AIA

1600 ˚A at each box. The results are shown in ﬁgures 7 (b), (d), and (f). The ﬁrst two M-class ﬂares

obviously occur on PIL B located in the center, i.e., the MFR B having positive twist would cause

these ﬂares. Therefore, we can suggest that the M5.5 ﬂare is mainly driven by the MFR having

positive twist. Regarding the last M-ﬂare, the intensity is not only observed at the same PIL but

also at the PIL C located in the east. Interestingly, the AIA intensity proﬁle at PIL A located in

west was quiet during this period. The MFR residing there produced the successive X-class ﬂares

later. This result suggests that the MFR can accumulate the free energy during this period without

being interrupted.

evolution of τ+ is plotted over the evolution of the GOES X-ray ﬂux which is same as Figure 1 (a).

3.2. Magnetic ﬁeld structure which produced the M5.5 ﬂare

As shown in ﬁgure 5 (c), the temporal evolutions of GOES X-ray ﬂux and the magnetic ﬂux of the

MFR dominated by the positive twist, τ+, seem to have a good correlation with each other. This

result suggests the formation of the MFR B, having positive twist, closely relates to the occurrence

of M- and C-class ﬂares. However, the exact trigger mechanism of these ﬂares is not yet clear.

Therefore, we investigate the initiation, in particular, focusing on the M5.5 ﬂare which is the largest

indicated by red arrows in the white square shown in ﬁgure 8 (a). These are enhanced on the both

sides of the eastern PIL and central PIL, respectively. However, in the early phase of the ﬂare (at

20:37 UT), the two ﬂare ribbons grow on both side of the center PIL as shown in ﬁgure 8 (b). Figure

9 (a) shows a close-up of the AIA 1600 ˚A image at 20:30 UT in which the initial brightenings of

the M5.5 ﬂare are found. In ﬁgure 9 (b), we traced the ﬁeld lines from the region where the initial

brightenings are enhanced, i.e., these ﬁeld lines shown in orange are related to the onset of the M5.5

ﬂare. Figure 9 (c) shows ﬁeld lines that form the three MFRs in addition to the ﬁeld lines shown in

ﬁgure 9 (b). It is found that the MFRs are covered with the orange lines. For a better understanding

of the ﬁeld conﬁguration, we produced ﬁgure 9 (d) in which the ﬁeld lines are traced only in the

x − z plane at y = 0.5, and on which the current density |J | is displayed with colors. The regions

of enhanced current |J | correspond to the regions where the MFRs exist. We also found that a

magnetic null point exists above MFR B.

We further plot the decay index n, which is a proxy of the torus instability (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006),

in ﬁgure 10. The decay index n is deﬁned as n = −(z/|Bex|)(∂|Bex|/∂z) where Bex denotes the

horizontal component of the external ﬁeld. Here we asume that the external ﬁeld is the potential

ﬁeld. According to the ﬁgure, since the MFRs A and C reside outside of the region that satisﬁes

n > 1.5, we suggest that these MFRs are stable to the torus instability. However, MFR B is located

in the region where the decay index n is larger than 1.5.

The electrical current distrubution is the same as in ﬁgure 9.

In this study, in order to clarify the evolution of the 3D magnetic ﬁeld and ﬂare activities observed

in AR 12673, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the 3D magnetic ﬁeld structure based on the time

series of the NLFFFs from September 4th 00:00 UT to 6th 00:00 UT. We calculated the magnetic

twist from each NLFFF, and consequently, found that three MFRs are formed above three PILs in

parallel before the M5.5 ﬂare, observed at 18:30 UT on September 4th. Interestingly one MFR (MFR

B) locating in the center has positive helicity while the other two (MFRs A and C) have negative

helicity. From our detailed analysis, the evolution of the magnetic ﬂux of MFR B has a good

18

Yamasaki et al.

correlation with the GOES ﬂux evolution while the M- and C-class ﬂares were observed. Therefore,

we suggest that these ﬂares were driven by the formation of the MFR B. We further analyzed the 3D

magnetic structure in vicinity of the three MFRs. We found a magnetic null above MFR B at 20:24

UT on September 4th. Vemareddy (2019) also reported that a magnetic null was formed in a similar

location at 18:30 UT on September 4th. Since the AIA 1600 ˚A image shows intensity enhancements

in the beginning of the M5.5 ﬂare where the footpoints of the magnetic ﬁeld lines including magnetic

null are anchored, we suggest that null point reconnection possibly helps to accelerate the MFR B.

Furthermore, as shown in ﬁgure 10, we found that MFR B would be unstable to the torus instability.

Inoue et al. (2018a) showed that MFRs can be accelerated even in an isolated area where the decay

index n has high value to drive the instability. Therefore, in this case, the torus instability possibly

pushed the MFR B and enhanced the reconnection at the magnetic null. Namely, the interaction

between the torus instability and reconnection might be important driving the eruption.

Figure 11 schematically describes a scenario for the M5.5 ﬂare obtained from our study. When the

positive twisted MFR B is formed at the site between the MFRs A and C, it pushes the pre-existing

magnetic ﬁeld upward which drives the reconnection at the null point. The null point reconnection is

able to remove the magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the MFR B, consequently, the MFR B can easily escape

from the lower corona resulting in the eruption. However, reconnected ﬁeld lines would suppress the

instabilityof neighboring MFRs A and C. Therefore, only MFR B would escape from the lower corona.

However, we conﬁrmed that the AIA 1600 ˚A brightening is relatively weak above the PIL located

on the west side of the AR, compared to those located in the middle and east side. The MFR A

located above the PIL in west causes successive X-class ﬂares on September 6th (Hou et al. 2018;

Inoue et al. 2018b; Mitra et al. 2018). Therefore, we suggest that MFR A can accumulate the

enough free magnetic energy to produce the X-ﬂares as a result of photospheric motions without

being disturbed. In addition, at the west-side PIL the intruding motion of the negative peninsula

toward the neighboring positive was observed before the X2.2 ﬂare (Bamba et al. 2020). Taking

into account our results, this intrusion would be important to break the equilibrium of the MFR A,

resulting in triggering the X-ﬂares.

According to our study, we suggest that not only the properties of the MFRs but also the 3D magnetic

topology overlying the MFR is important to understand the onset of solar ﬂares. Therefore, we

consider that this information should be taken into account when considering future ﬂare prediction

schemes.

Figure 11. The schematic of the magnetic ﬁeld structure before and after the M5.5 ﬂare. Red and blue

twisted lines represent the MFRs A, B, and C. The red and blue represent the sign of the helicity where the

red and blue correspond to positive and negative, respectively. Green lines show the coronal magnetic ﬁeld

lines, which experience the reconnection at the magnetic null point in the early phase of M5.5 ﬂare. Yellow

line shows the current sheet. Red arrows in (a) indicate the location of initial brightenings, and those in (b)

indicate the location of the ﬂare ribbons.
