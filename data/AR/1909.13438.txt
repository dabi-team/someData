Abstract

We fabricated spin-polarized surface electronic states with tunable Fermi level from semicon-

ductor to low-dimensional metal in the Bi/GaSb(110)-(2×1) surface using angle-resolved photo-

electron spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES. The spin-polarized surface band of

Bi/GaSb(110) exhibits quasi-one-dimensional character with the Rashba parameter αR of 4.1 and

2.6 eV˚A at the ¯Γ and ¯Y points of the surface Brillouin zone, respectively. The Fermi level of

the surface electronic state is tuned in situ by element-selective Ar-ion sputtering on the GaSb

substrate. The giant Rashba-type spin splitting with switchable metallic/semiconducting charac-

ter on semiconductor substrate makes this system a promising candidate for future researches in

low-dimensional spintronic phenomena.

INTRODUCTION

Spin-polarized conduction path in low-dimensional systems (spintronic circuits), which

can be realized by the surface states of topological insulators (TIs) [1] for example, has

garnered signiﬁcant attention recently, because it hosts exotic spintronic phenomena, such

as spin-charge conversion and unconventional terahertz emission [2–4]. Among them, the

Rashba eﬀect at crystal surfaces is a promising platform for designing such low-dimensional

systems [5]. Due to the lack of the space inversion symmetry at the surface, spin-orbit inter-

action (SOI) induces a sizable spin polarization in surface electronic states even without fer-

romagnetic materials. The conduction path from surface electronic states with Rashba-type

SOI is intrinsically switchable from semiconductor to metal, in contrast to the topologically

protected, always metallic surface states of TIs, which is a great strongpoint for designated

spintronic circuits. Moreover, as such Rashba-type SOI can occur in surface systems fab-

ricated on ordinary semiconductor substrates [6, 7], it has been studied extensively for the

development of sptronic devices, which exhibit excellent compatibility with semiconductor

substrates.

Recently, we reported that a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) surface, Bi chains on a semi-

conductor InAs(110) substrate, exhibits giant Rashba-type spin splitting in its electronic

states [8]. Here, we obtained the Rashba parameter αR, a widely used scale of Rashba-type
SOI, as 5.5 eV ˚A, which is close to the maximum value reported for Rashba-like systems

[9–13]. The Bi Q1D chain did not become a metal but a semiconductor with an energy gap
of 0.04 eV between the Fermi level (EF) and the valence band maximum at the ¯Y point,
which limits its application for spintronic circuits. This issue can be resolved by tuning

EF to make the surface state metallic so that spin-polarized transport can be realized. To

achieve this EF tuning of surface electronic structure, some methods have been reported,

such as co-evaporation with the neighboring element in the periodic table [14], alkali-metal

evaporation [15], and excess evaporation of the elements to form a surface superstructure for

providing electrons to the surface electronic states [16–18]. Application of these methods to

the Bi Q1D chains can be fruitful for their implementation in spintronic devices. In parallel,

it is also desirable to increase the energy gap of the substrate compared with that of InAs

(0.36 eV at 300 K), which is too small to ignore the thermal spin-degenerate carriers from

substrates, while maintaining a similar surface electronic structure.

2

In this work, we investigate the surface electronic states of the zig-zag chains of Bi on

GaSb(110), which exhibit giant Rashba-type spin splitting. The surface atomic structure

is depicted in Fig. 1(a), which is similar to that of Bi/InAs(110) reported previously;

the bulk bandgap of GaSb (0.68 eV at 300 K) is about two times larger than that of

InAs. The Q1D feature of the surface bands of Bi/GaSb(110) was demonstrated by angle-
resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). We obtained αR as 4.1 and 2.6 eV ˚A at the
¯Γ and ¯Y points of the surface Brillouin zone (SBZ), respectively. These values are slightly

smaller than those of Bi/InAs(110), but are still quite a large value. Further, we tuned

EF of Bi/GaSb(110) by element-selective Ar-ion sputtering on the GaSb substrates. The

surface bands rigidly shifted by ∼100 meV toward the lower binding energy; consequently,

these bands crossed EF, indicating the in-situ transition of surface electronic states from

semiconductor to low-dimensional and spin-polarized metal.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The clean GaSb(110)-(1×1) substrates were fabricated by two diﬀerent methods. In the

ﬁrst method, a side face of single-crystal GaSb(001) wafers was cleaved. The second method

involved repeated cycles of Ar-ion sputtering (with acceleration energy of 0.5 - 1.0 keV) and

annealing at temperatures up to 700 K. The prepared samples are denoted as “cleaved”

and “S&A” surfaces, respectively. A few monolayers of Bi were evaporated from a Knudsen

cell at room temperature and then annealed at 550 K for more than 10 minutes. The

atomic structures of the obtained surfaces were visualized by low-energy electron diﬀraction

(LEED). The LEED patterns for both the samples are shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), which

exhibit sharp patterns with low background (2×1) periodicity, indicating well-deﬁned surface

of Bi/GaSb(110). The distortions in these patterns are due to the ﬂat micro channel plate

used for LEED measurements. The common (2×1) patterns in both the cases suggest the

formation of Bi Q1D atomic chains on GaSb(110) substrates [19].

ARPES and core-level photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed with a
He discharge lamp and synchrotron radiation at the CASSIOP´EE beamline of synchrotron

SOLEIL. Spin-resolved ARPES (SARPES) measurements were conducted at the Institute

for Solid State Physics, the University of Tokyo with linearly polarized laser source (hν =

6.994 eV) [20]. The energy resolution and the position of EF were calibrated by the Fermi

3

edge of Ta foils attached to the samples. For the ARPES (SARPES) measurements, the
incident plane of photons was [001] ([¯110]), and the energy resolution was 12 meV (30 meV).

The eﬀective Sherman function of the SARPES spin detector was set to 0.27.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figures 2(a) and 2(c) show the ARPES intensity plots of the Bi-induced (2×1) surface
on the cleaved GaSb(110) substrates (called cleaved Bi/GaSb) along ¯Γ– ¯X and ¯Y– ¯M, respec-

tively, in the SBZ shown in Fig. 2(e). Paired parabolic bands are located slightly below
EF at around ¯Γ and ¯Y, demonstrating semiconducting characteristics of the surface. The
shapes of these bands are qualitatively similar to those of the Q1D surface electronic states

of Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) [8], which originate from the common “missing − row(cid:48)(cid:48) model with

the zig-zag Bi chains, as shown in Fig. 1(a) [19, 21].

Figures 2(b) and 2(d) show the ARPES band dispersions of Bi/GaSb(110)-(2×1) fab-

ricated on the S&A GaSb(110) substrates (called S&A Bi/GaSb hereafter). The obtained

band dispersions are similar to those observed for the cleaved Bi/GaSb, but they are shifted
toward lower binding energies. Especially, the top of the valence band along ¯Y– ¯M disap-

pears, which suggests that the band crosses EF. The right side of Fig. 2(f) shows the

constant-energy contour of the S&A Bi/GaSb surface with the binding energy range of 0 ±

20 meV, which corresponds to a Fermi surface. A butterﬂy-like, highly anisotropic Fermi
surface appears near ¯Y, which is consistent with the constant-energy contour of the cleaved

Bi/GaSb surface at the binding energy of 95 ± 20 meV. The detailed discussion on this point

is shown in the following part. Comparing the ARPES intensity plots from the cleaved and

S&A surfaces in Figs. 2(a-d), the line width and background of the S&A sample are slightly

broader and higher than those of the cleaved ones. It would be due to the damages by the

Ar-ion sputtering. The same trend can be also found in the LEED patterns (Figs. 1 (b)

and 1(c))

The pair of parabolic bands are symmetric with respect to the time-reversal-invariant
momenta (¯Γ and ¯Y), which is consistent with that expected by the conventional Rashba

eﬀect [5]. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the SARPES (upper ﬁgure) and ARPES (lower
ﬁgure) momentum distribution curves (MDCs) along ¯Y– ¯M at the binding energies of 20

meV and 100 meV, respectively. The ﬁlled (open) triangles in the upper ﬁgures indicate the

4

spin-resolved MDCs parallel (anti-parallel) to [001]. The peak positions in the upper and

lower ﬁgures remain same despite the diﬀerent photon energy, suggesting that these peaks
In the MDCs, peaks appear at ±0.02 and ±0.10 ˚A−1
originate from the surface states.
corresponding to the binding energy of 20 meV (at ±0.14 ˚A−1 and 100 meV), which agree

with the band dispersions shown in Fig. 2(d). These MDC peaks are clearly spin polarized.

The spin-polarization orientation of these peaks is reversed together with the sign of k//[¯110],

as expected in the Rashba-type spin-orbit splitting of surface bands. These spin polarizations

are consistent with the spin-polarized surface electronic structure of Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) [8].

The magnitude of Rashba-type spin splitting is often characterized by the Rashba pa-

rameter αR = 2ER/k0, assuming parabolic dispersion. Here, ER and k0 are the diﬀerence

in energy and wavevector between the Kramers degenerate point and the top (or bottom)

of the parabolic band, respectively. From the surface band dispersions in Figs. 2(a) and
2(b), ER and k0 along ¯Γ– ¯X ( ¯Y– ¯M) can be obtained as 0.29 (0.065) eV and 0.14 (0.05) ˚A,
respectively. Accordingly, αR along ¯Γ– ¯X ( ¯Y– ¯M) is 4.1 (2.6) eV˚A. Although the values of αR
are slightly smaller than that obtained for Bi/InAs(110)-(2×1) with a similar surface atomic
structure (5.5 eV ˚A along ¯Γ– ¯X and 3.6 eV ˚A along ¯Y– ¯M) [8], they are still three-four times

larger than that reported for other Q1D and 1D systems such as Pt/Si(110)[22] and the

edges of Bi(111)/Si(111) [23], and are comparable to the values obtained for giant Rashba

systems such as two-dimensional Bi/Ag surface and three-dimensional BiTeI [9–11].

The diﬀerence of αR between Bi/GaSb(110) and Bi/InAs(110) can be attributed to the

slight variation in the surface atomic structure. Table I shows the bond lengths and relative

atomic displacements along [110] plane of the Bi atomic chains on InAs(110) and GaSb(110)
[19, 21, 24, 25]. The bulk lattice constants of InAs and GaSb are 6.06 ˚A and 6.10 ˚A,

respectively, with a diﬀerence of less than 1 %. Compared to this small diﬀerence, the inter-

atomic distances in the Bi-adsorbed surfaces are large. Bond lengths between Bi atoms of

Bi/GaSb are 3-4 % larger. In contrast, the bond lengths of Bi-Ga and Bi-Sb in Bi/GaSb

are shorter than those of Bi-In and Bi-As in Bi/InAs (diﬀerence of 4-6 %), except for the

bond Bi1-Ga1 (In1).
In addition, the vertical displacements of the Bi atomic chains in
Bi/GaSb(110) are larger than that in Bi/InAs(110) by 0.05 ˚A for ∆1−2 and 0.15 ˚A for ∆3−4.

This diﬀerence may be attributed to the ionicity of III−V semiconductor, as reported in an

earlier work [21]. Actually, the Phillips ionicity of GaSb (0.26) is smaller than that of InAs

(0.36) [26]. Thus, the ionic character of the surface anions and cations can aﬀect the valence

5

bond of Bi atoms and modify the surface bond lengths. It is well established the magnitude

of Rashba-type spin splitting is strongly inﬂuenced by the orbital composition of the surface

states and the charge distribution near the surface atoms, and both of them can be modiﬁed

by the structural and valence changes around surface Bi atoms as discussed above [27, 28].

Therefore, this can be rational cause for the change in the magnitude of Rashba eﬀect in

Bi/GaSb(110) and Bi/InAs(110).

Further insights into the dependence of the surface cleaning method on the surface-band

shift can be obtained from the left-side ﬁgures in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), which show the peak

positions of the energy distribution curves (EDCs) from the ARPES intensity plots in Figs.
2(b,d) (¯Γ– ¯X) and 2(c,e) ( ¯Y– ¯M), respectively. The circles (squares) indicate the EDC peaks

of cleaved (S&A) Bi/GaSb. In the right-side ﬁgures, the peak positions of S&A Bi/GaSb are

shifted by 95 meV and become consistent with those of cleaved Bi/GaSb. This suggests that

the S&A operation aﬀects the rigid band shift without causing any deformation to the band

dispersion. This can be conﬁrmed by the constant-energy contours shown in Fig. 2(f), which

indicate that the S&A Bi/GaSb at 0 ± 20 meV is consistent with that of cleaved Bi/GaSb

at 95 ± 20 meV. The only diﬀerence is that the center of the batterﬂy-shape contour of the

cleaved Bi/GaSb has high intensity. It would be from the high-binding-energy tail of the

surface bands lying close to EF (around the apex of the paired parabola) which is located

in the unoccupied region in S&A Bi/GaSb.

We examined the variation of core-level spectra to gain further information on the origin

of this rigid band shift in S&A Bi/GaSb. The core-level spectra of cleaved and S&A samples

obtained with 40.8-eV and 80-eV photons are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Figures

4(a-c) and 4(d-g) show the spectra of GaSb(110) and Bi/GaSb(110)-(2×1), respectively.

Figures 4(a) and 4(d) illustrate the wide-range spectra measured by He-II light source (hν

= 40.8 eV). The spectra in Figs. 4(b,c) and 4(d-f) are obtained after subtracting the Shirley-

type background from Figs. 4(a) and 4(d), respectively. Further annealing for more than

10 minutes in the S&A samples caused no change on the area of Bi 5d peaks. Figures

5(a-e) and 5(f-j) show the experimental and ﬁtted core level spectra of cleaved and S&A

samples, respectively, which are obtained using 80-eV photons. Asymmetric pseudo-Voigt

function [29] and Shirley-type background were used for the ﬁtting. The magnitude of spin-

orbit splitting in Sb 4d, Ga 3d, and Bi 5d was set to 1.25, 0.43 and 3.06 eV, respectively,

according to earlier studies [30, 31]. Table II summarizes the ratios of peak areas between

6

diﬀerent elements obtained from the spectra in Figs. 4 and 5. The peak areas of each

element are obtained by integrating the spectra around the target peak after background

subtraction in Fig. 4. The peak-area ratios between each species, such as Ga-S and Ga-B,

are obtained from the ﬁtting results shown in Fig. 5. The ﬁttings were performed with the

minimum number of parameters to reproduce the measured spectra, except for the Bi 5d

levels on the S&A substrate; the details are provided as follows.

Table II shows the peak-area ratios between diﬀerent elements. The obtained ratio is

∼1.96 (1.92) for cleaved (S&A) GaSb(110) from Figs. 4(b,c) and 4(d,f). Figures 5(a) and

5(b) show the core-level spectra of Sb 4d and Ga 3d for the cleaved GaSb(110) substrate

and their ﬁttings. The peaks in the examined area “B” (shaded area “S”) correspond to

the contribution from the bulk (surface) Sb and Ga orbitals, which are similar to those

shown in Fig. 4. These assignments are the same as those of the earlier work [30]. The

surface component S of Ga 3d (Sb 4d) shifts toward higher (lower) binding energy side due

to the charge transfer between Ga and Sb, which corresponds to their displacement from the

original (bulk) position in the topmost atomic layer. The Sb 4d spectrum in Fig. 5(f) is split

into two components, similar to the cleaved substrate in Fig. 5(a), but the peak intensity

from the surface contribution S decreases. Moreover, a new feature S’ on Ga 3d in Fig.

5(g) appears at a lower binding energy than the bulk (B) and surface (S) components. This

feature can be attributed to the non-bonding states of Ga atoms, similar to that observed in

the core-level spectrum of In 4d for S&A InAs(110) surface [32]. These results suggest that

Sb atoms are preferentially removed from the surface by Ar-ion sputtering, and remnant Ga

atoms form a cluster on the surface. Such element-selective sputtering is natural because of

the diﬀerent Ar sputter yields for each element, Ga and Sb in this case [33].

Figures 5(f-e, h-j) show the core-level spectra of Sb 4d, Ga 3d, and Bi 5d for cleaved and

S&A Bi/GaSb. In the former two, the intensity ratio between S and B are similar in both

the substrates, except for the non-bonding feature S’ in Ga 3d. The Bi 5d levels of cleaved

Bi/GaSb (Fig. 5(d)) could be decomposed into only three components from the current

dataset. The highest (lowest) binding energy component Bia (Bic) is mainly induced by

Bi-Sb (Bi-Ga) bonding according to earlier reports [19, 31]. The origin of the middle one

(Bib) is uncertain; this peak may be induced by the overlap of both Bi atoms, which are

bonded with anions and cations. From the Bi-(2×1) structure (see Fig. 1), Bi atoms should

occupy four diﬀerent sites. However, we could not decompose four diﬀerent peaks from the

7

current data, possibly due to the limited energy resolution. On the other hand, it is diﬃcult

to ﬁt the Bi 5d levels of S&A Bi/GaSb with the same number of components as those used

in the ﬁtting of cleaved Bi/GaSb. As the band dispersions of surface states are same for

both the substrates (Figs. 2 and 3), it can be assumed that the Bi-(2×1) surface atomic

structure is similar for both of them. Based on this assumption, we added one more peak

(Bid) for ﬁtting the curve corresponding to S&A Bi/GaSb. For the other three peaks (Bia

– Bic), the relative intensity and energy diﬀerences were kept at the same values as those

for the cleaved substrate. Using this method, we could reproduce the Bi 5d levels of S&A

Bi/GaSb, which is shown in Fig. 5(i). The Bid peak lies between Bib and Bic. After the

formation of the Bi-(2×1) surface, the peak-area ratios corresponding to Sb/Ga and Bi/Sb

are obtained as ∼2.27 and 0.54 for cleaved Bi/GaSb (∼2.17 and 0.89 for S&A Bi/GaSb),

respectively. This implies that S&A Bi/GaSb contains larger amount of Bi than cleaved

Bi/GaSb. The additional Bid component may be attributed to the insertion of Bi atoms in

the Sb vacancies formed by Ar-ion sputtering.

As summarized in Tab. III, all peak widths of the S&A samples are wider than those of

the cleaved ones. For the ﬁtting, we ﬁxed the widths of the surface peaks to be the same as

those of the corresponding bulk peaks in the same elements in each same surface treatment,

except for Bid discussed above. Such peak broadening is the most signiﬁcant in the Ga

peaks, possibly because some Ga atoms no longer have its bonding partner (Sb) after Ar-ion

sputtering. These peak broadenings are consistent with the slightly broad ARPES images

and LEED patterns of the S&A surfaces (see Figs. 1 and 2).

Based on the above analysis, there are two possible sources for the hole doping in the

surface bands. The ﬁrst one is the formation of surface Ga clusters observed as the S’

features in Ga 3d levels on the S&A substrate (Fig. 5(j)). This Ga cluster can attract

surface electrons, thereby causing hole doping into the surface Bi Q1D chains. The second

probable origin is the insertion of Bi in the Sb vacancy sites on the GaSb substrate. The

electronegativity of Bi is 2.0, which is equal to that of Sb. Therefore, from the viewpoint

of electronegativity, substituted Bi cannot contribute to the hole doping. However, as the

ionic radius of Bi is larger than that of Sb, slight distortion and/or chemical pressure in

the surface atomic structure can be induced. Such structural deformation can contribute

to hole doping, e.g., through Jahn-Teller eﬀect. It should be noted that the surface band

dispersions are not sensitive to such mechanisms and their variations are negligible, similar

8

to that observed for rigid energy shifts. This suggests that the Bi zig-zag chains formed in

the topmost surface layer are an essential part of the Rashba-split surface bands, and the

hole-doping mechanism is not related to them, occurring in the sub-surface region.

It should be noted that the similar energy shifts also occur in the core-level spectra,

as summarized in Tab.

IV. Both in the GaSb(110) substrates and Bi/GaSb(110)-(2×1)

surfaces, all the core-level peaks shift to the lower binding energies by S&A. However, the

core-level energy shifts are 60±20 meV, which are smaller than those observed in the surface

valence bands. It suggests that the hole doping mainly occurs in the valence bands of surface

Bi atoms and the shifts of the other states occur by dragging like the chemical shifts in the

core-levels caused by the valence-electron modiﬁcations.

SUMMARY

In this work, we fabricated the surface electronic states with giant Rashba-type spin

splitting on Bi/GaSb(110)-(2×1) and succeeded to tune its Fermi level to cause the in-

situ transition from semiconductor to surface metal with spin-polarized conduction path.

The surface band of Bi/GaSb(110) exhibits quasi 1D feature with Rashba parameter αR
= 2.6 – 4.1 eV˚A. The Fermi level of the surface states of Bi/GaSb(110) was tuned by

element-selective Ar-ion sputtering on the GaSb substrate. The surface bands shifted to

the lower binding energies rigidly by ∼95 meV, which indicates the presence of metallic

conduction paths on the surface. As this metallic and spin-polarized surface is fabricated

in-situ by Ar-ion sputtering, it would be easy to design the miniaturized surface circuits by

using focused ion-beam method. Such system would provides a useful platform for future

spin-dependent energy conversions such as spin-charge conversion and spin-current-induced

terahertz emission.
