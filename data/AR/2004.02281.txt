Analyzing initial stage of COVID-19
transmission through Bayesian time-varying
model

Abstract

Recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has aﬀected all of our lives in one way
or the other. While medical researchers are working hard to ﬁnd a cure and doctors/nurses
to attend the aﬀected individuals, measures such as ‘lockdown’, ‘stay-at-home’, ‘social dis-
tancing’ are being implemented in diﬀerent parts of the world to curb its further spread.
To model the non-stationary spread, we propose a novel time-varying semiparametric AR(p)
model for the count valued time-series of newly aﬀected cases, collected every day and also
extend it to propose a novel time-varying INGARCH model. Our proposed structures of the
models are amenable to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for eﬃcient computation.
We substantiate our methods by simulations that show superiority compared to some of the
close existing methods. Finally we analyze the daily time series data of newly conﬁrmed
cases to study its spread through diﬀerent government interventions.

Introduction

Coronavirus is a class of viruses that primarily aﬀect mammals and birds. The viruses in this

class predominantly cause respiratory infections among humans. Most of these viruses from this

class only cause mild respiratory infections or the common cold. To date, three viruses in this

class have been turned out to be deadly.

In 2002-03, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute

Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) with 11% fatality rate (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003). The year

2015 observed another deadly coronavirus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome(MERS) with 35%

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
fatality(Alsolamy and Arabi, 2015). The third one is COVID-19 which has caused this current

outbreak. The reported fatality of this virus is yet very low as compared to the other two. However,

it spreads much faster and can cause “community spread” when the cause of the infection can

no longer be traced back to its source. The source of this virus has been traced back to the wet

market in Wuhan, China and dates back to December 2019. Since then, it has been spreading

across the world. On January 20, 2020, United States (USA) recorded its ﬁrst COVID-19 patient

in a man, returning from Wuhan, China. Italy reported its ﬁrst conﬁrmed case on January 31,

2020. After that, it has been spreading continuously.

Since there is no vaccine yet in the market, the government is implementing strong measures

such as city-wide or state-wide ‘lockdown’s, ‘stay-at-home’ notices, extensive testing to control

the outbreak. Thus, this count-valued time-series of daily new cases of infection is expected to

vary largely. While initially by the contagious nature these spread looks exponential, once some

measures are undertaken the number of cases goes down but at varying degrees depending on how

strict was the enforcement, how dense is the population, etc. There has been ample research study

in a very short time to discuss the eﬀectiveness of lockdown and forecast of the future path of

how the virus will spread. But somehow a comprehensive understanding of the statistical model,

its estimation and uncertainty quantiﬁcation remains inadequate. SIR model (Song et al., 2020),

proportional model (Deb and Majumdar, 2020), some Bayesian epidemic models (Clancy et al.,

2008; Jewell et al., 2009) etc. have been used in the context of continuous modelling because it

beneﬁts time-series formulation and ready computation. Relatively straight-forward models have

been considered such as polynomial trends or presence of an ARMA structure etc. However, we

wish to stick to the actual daily count of new aﬀections and this brings us to a unique juncture of

analyzing a count time series with smooth varying coeﬃcients.

Modeling count time series is important in many diﬀerent ﬁelds such as disease incidence,

accident rates, integer ﬁnancial datasets such as price movement, etc. This relatively new research

stream was introduced in Zeger (1988) and interestingly he analyzed another outbreak namely

the US 1970 Polio incidence rate. This stream was furthered by Chan and Ledolter (1995) where

Poisson generalized linear models (GLM) with an autoregressive latent process in the mean are

discussed. A wide range of dependence was explored in Davis et al. (2003) for simple autoregressive

(AR) structure and external covariates. On the other hand, a diﬀerent stream explored integer-

2

valued time series counts such as ARMA structures as in (Brandt and Williams, 2001; Biswas and

Song, 2009) or INGARCH structure as done in Zhu (2011, 2012c,a,b). However, from a Bayesian

perspective, only work to best of our knowledge is that of Silveira de Andrade et al. (2015) where

the authors discussed an ARMA model for diﬀerent count series parameters. However, their

treatment of ignoring zero-valued data or putting the MA structure by demeaned Poisson random

variable remains questionable. None of these works focused on the time-varying nature of the

coeﬃcients except for a brief mention in Karmakar et al. (2020+).

The rapid change in the observed counts make all earlier time-constant analysis inappropriate

and builds a path where we can explore methodological and inferential development in tracking

down the trajectory of this spread. Thus, we propose a novel semiparametric time-varying au-

toregressive model for counts to study the spread and examine the eﬀects of these interventions

in the spread based on the time-varying coeﬃcient functions. A time-varying AR(p) process con-

sists of a time-varying mean/intercept function along with time-varying autoregressive coeﬃcient

functions. We further generalize it to a time-varying integer-valued generalized autoregressive

conditional heteroscedasticity (tvINGARCH) model where the conditional mean depends also on

the past conditional means. Given the exponential trend of the spread, it is expected that the

mean would vary with the level.

Our goals are motivated by both the application and methodological development. To the best

of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst attempt to model possibly autoregressive count time series with

time-varying coeﬃcients. The mean function stands for the overall spread and the autoregressive

coeﬃcients stand for diﬀerent lags. Since this virus can be a largely asymptomatic carrier for the

ﬁrst few days we wish to identify which lags are signiﬁcant in our model which can be directly

linked to how many days the symptom spread but did not show up. We show that for diﬀerent

areas lags 6 to 10 are signiﬁcant. These ﬁndings are in-line with several research articles discussing

the incubation length for the novel coronavirus with a median of 5-6 days and 98% below 11 days.

For example, see Lauer et al. (2020b). A few provinces, state, countries have ordered lockdown or

stay-at-home orders of various degree and we ﬁnd that even after these orders are in eﬀect it takes

about 12-16 days to reach the peak and then the intercept coeﬃcient function starts decreasing.

This is also an interesting ﬁnd which characterizes the fact that the number of infected but

asymptomatic cases is large compared to the new cases reported. Additional to the time-varying

3

AR model proposal, we also oﬀer an analysis via time-varying INGARCH model that assumes an

additional recursive term in the conditional expectation (cf. (2.9)). This extension oﬀers some

more comprehensiveness in the modeling part as even INGARCH with small orders can help us get

rid of choosing an appropriate maximum lag value. Since for a Poisson model, the mean is same

as the variance, this can also be thought as an extension of the GARCH model in the context of

count data. First introduced by Ferland et al. (2006), these models were thoroughly analyzed in

Zhu (2012c,a, 2011, 2012b); Ahmad and Francq (2016). Our proposal of time-varying INGARCH

model adapts to the non-stationarity theme and also can be viewed as a new contribution. Finally,

we contrast the time-varying AR and the GARCH for both simulations and real-data applications

under diﬀerent metrics of evaluation.

An important criticism of the estimate of basic reproduction number in the various research

items over the past two months of Feb and March 2020 is its huge degree of variability. This

skepticism is natural as the serial interval distribution of a disease cannot be estimated consistently

unless we have an exact infector/infectee pair dataset. The majority of this research is pulling out

these estimates based on what we know about two other outbreaks, namely SARS and MERS.

One can easily see the R0 estimates from the popular R0 package by Obadia et al. (2012) depends

on the start and end date and a plugin value of the serial distribution. Keeping this in mind,

we decided to NOT have R0 coeﬃcient in our model.

Instead, we focus on the autoregressive

coeﬃcient functions and provide insights which we believe can be used to develop new estimates

of the basic reproduction number from the data itself, without having to rely on the serial number

distribution from other diseases.

In our present context, the number of aﬀected can be covered by the popular SIR model

in this case, however, they assume additional structure on how these numbers evolve and then

tries to estimate the rate.

Instead, we do not assume any such speciﬁc evolution and oﬀer a

general perspective. Our simulation results corroborate a consistent estimation of the unknown

functions. Regression models with varying coeﬃcient were introduced by Hastie and Tibshirani

(1993). They modeled the varying coeﬃcients using cubic B-splines. Later, these models has been

further explored in various directions Gu and Wahba (1993); Biller and Fahrmeir (2001); Fan and

Zhang (2008); Franco-Villoria et al. (2019); Yue et al. (2014). Spline bases have been routinely

used to model the time-varying coeﬃcients within non-linear time series models (Cai et al., 2000;

4

Huang et al., 2002; Huang and Shen, 2004; Amorim et al., 2008). We also consider the B-spline

series based priors to model the time-varying coeﬃcients in our model. In Bayesian literature of

non-linear function modeling, B-splines series based priors have been extensively developed under

diﬀerent shape constraints (He and Shi, 1998; Meyer, 2012; Das and Ghosal, 2017; Mulgrave et al.,

2018; Roy et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, there is no other work that puts (2.2) or

(2.10)-speciﬁc shape constraints, required for a time-varying AR or GARCH using B-spline series.

We also discuss a pointwise inferential tool by drawing credible intervals. Such tools are important

to keep an objective perspective in terms of the evolution of the time-varying coeﬃcients without

restricting it to some speciﬁc trend models. See Karmakar et al. (2020+) ( Karmakar (2018) for

an earlier version) for a comprehensive discussion on time-varying models and their applications.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed Bayesian models

in detail. Section 3 discusses an eﬃcient computational scheme for the proposed method. We study

the performance of our proposed method in capturing true coeﬃcient functions and show excellent

performance over other existing methods in Section 4. Section 5 deals with an application of the

proposed method on COVID-19 spread for diﬀerent countries. Then, we end with discussions,

concluding remarks and possible future directions in Section 6. The supplementary materials

contain theoretical proofs.

2 Modeling

In this paper, our primary focus is on modeling the daily count of newly conﬁrmed cases of

COVID-19 in a non-parametric way.

Instead of compartmental models from epidemiology, we

choose to focus on building a model solely out of the COVID-19 dataset. Figure 1 illustrates the

logarithm of the absolute values of ﬁtted residuals for diﬀerent methods on the COVID-19 spread

data from Spain. We ﬁnd that the time-varying AR model ﬁts the data much better than other

routinely used time-constant methods. Given the current knowledge of the incubation period of

the virus (Lauer et al., 2020a), we ﬁt models until lag 10 for the autoregressive part. For the

conditional heteroscedastic models, we consider the order as (1,1), which is a standard choice

for such models. This motivates us to consider the non-stationary time-series models such as

usual tvAR regression. However, we emphasize that these existing methods are suitable only for

continuous valued variables and not for count-valued series.

data from Spain.

This motivation sets up the stage to discuss Poisson autoregression with time-varying coeﬃ-

cients. Let {Xt} be a count-valued time series. In this paper, we consider two diﬀerent structures

for the conditional mean of {Xt} given the history of the process. The ﬁrst modeling framework is

in the spirit of time-varying auto-regressive models. Next, we consider another modeling structure

in the direction of time-varying generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models.

2.1 Time-varying auto-regressive model for counts

The linear Poisson autoregressive model (Zeger, 1988; Brandt and Williams, 2001) is popular

in analyzing count valued time series. Due to the assumed non-stationary nature of the data,

we propose a time-varying version of this model. The conditional distribution for count-valued

time-series Xt given Ft−1 = {Xi : i ≤ (t − 1)} is,

Xt|Ft−1 ∼Poisson(λt) where λt = µ(t/T ) +

p
(cid:88)

i=1

ai(t/T )Xt−i.

(2.1)

We call our method time-varying Bayesian Auto Regressive model for Counts (TVBARC). The

rescaling of the time-varying parameters to the support [0,1] is usual for in-ﬁlled asymptotics. Due

to the Poisson link in (2.1), both conditional mean and conditional variance depend on the past
observations. The conditional expectation of Xt in the above model (2.1) is E(Xt|Ft−1) = µ(t/T )+

6

(cid:80)p

i=1 ai(t/T )Xt−i, which is positive-valued. Additionally, we impose the following constraints on

parameter space for the time-varying parameters,

P1 = {µ, ai : µ(x) > 0, 0 ≤ ai(x) ≤ 1, sup
x

(cid:88)

k

ak(x) < 1}.

(2.2)

Note that, the conditions imposed (2.2) on the parameters is somewhat motivated from the sta-

tionarity conditions for the time-constant versions of this models. This is not uncommon in

time-varying AR literature. See Dahlhaus and Subba Rao (2006); Fryzlewicz et al. (2008); Kar-

makar et al. (2020+) for example. Even though the condition on µ(·) seem restrictive in the light

of what we need for invertible time-constant AR(p) process with Gaussian error, it is not unusual

when it is used to model variance parameters to ensure positivity; it was unanimously imposed

for all the literature mentioned above. Additionally, the above references heavily depend on local
stationarity: namely, for every rescaled time 0 < t < 1, they assume the existence of an ˜Xi process
which is close to the observed process. One key advantage of our proposal is it is free of any such

assumption. Our assumption of only the ﬁrst moment is also very mild. Moreover, except for a

very general linear model discussed in (Karmakar et al., 2020+), to the best of our knowledge,

this is the very ﬁrst analysis of the time-varying parameter for count time-series modeled by Pois-

son regression. Thus we choose to focus on the methodological development rather than proving

the optimality of these conditions. When p = 0, our proposed model reduces to routinely used

nonparametric Poisson regression model as in Shen and Ghosal (2015).

To proceed with Bayesian computation, we put priors on the unknown functions µ(·) and

ai(·)’s such that they are supported in P1. The prior distributions on these functions are induced

through basis expansions in B-splines with suitable constraints on the coeﬃcients to impose the

7

shape constraints as in P. Detail description of the priors are given below,

Here Bj’s are the B-spline basis functions. The parameters δj’s are unbounded.

In above construction, (cid:80)P

The prior induced by above construction are P-supported. The veriﬁcation is very straight-
j=0 Mj = 1. Thus (cid:80)P

j=1 Mj ≤ 1. Since 0 ≤ θij ≤ 1,
j=1 Mj ≤ 1 if and only
supx ai(x) ≤ Mi. Thus supx
if δ0 = −∞, which has probability zero. On the other hand, we also have µ(·) ≥ 0 as we have

i=1 Mi ≤ 1. We have (cid:80)P

i=1 ai(x) ≤ (cid:80)P

(cid:80)P

exp(βj) ≥ 0. Thus, the induced priors, described in (2.3)− (2.8) are well supported in P.

2.2 Time-varying generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedas-

ticity model for counts

In the previous model, both conditional mean and conditiona variance depend on the past observa-

tions. However, Ferland et al. (2006) proposed integer valued analogue of generalized autoregres-

sive conditional heteroscedasticity model (GARCH) after observing that the variability in number

of cases of campylobacterosis infections also changes with level. Given the complexity of COVID-19

data, we also introduce the following time-varying version of the integer valued generalized autore-

gressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (INGARCH) for counts. The conditional distribution

for count-valued time-series Xt given Ft−1 = {Xi : i ≤ (t − 1)} and Gt−1 = {λi : i ≤ (t − 1)} is,

Xt|Ft−1, Gt−1 ∼Poisson(λt) where λt = µ(t/T ) +

p
(cid:88)

(2.9)

We call our method time-varying Bayesian Integer valued Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional

Heteroscedastic (TVBINGARCH) model. We impose following constraints on the parameter space

8

similar to Ferreira et al. (2017),

P2 = {µ, ai : µ(x) > 0, 0 ≤ ai(x) ≤ 1, 0 ≤ aj(x) ≤ 1, sup
x

(cid:88)

(ai(x) + bj(x)) < 1}.

(2.10)

i,j

This constraint ensure a unique solution of the time-varying GARCH process as discussed in

Ferreira et al. (2017). Now, we modify the proposed prior from the previous subsection to put

prior on the functions µ(·), ai(·) and bj(·) such that they are supported in P2. Using the B-spline

bases, we put following hierarchical prior on the unknown functions,

µ(x) =

θij ∼U (0, 1) for 1 ≤ i ≤ p, 1 ≤ j ≤ K2,

ηkj ∼U (0, 1) for 1 ≤ k ≤ q, 1 ≤ j ≤ K3,

λ0 ∼Inverse-Gamma(d1, d1).

(2.19)

Similar calculations from previous subsection also shows that the above hierarchical prior in (2.11)

to (2.19) is well-supported in P2. We primarily focus on the special case where p = 1, q = 1.

3 Posterior computation

In this section, we discuss Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method for posterior

computation. Our proposed sampling is dependent on gradient based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

(HMC) sampling algorithm (Neal et al., 2011). Hence, we show the gradient computations of

the likelihood with respect to diﬀerent parameters for TVBARC(p) and TVBINGARCH(p, q) in

following two subsections.

While ﬁtting TVBINGARCH(p,q), we assume for any t < 0 Xt = 0, λt = 0. Thus, we need to

additionally estimate the parameter λ0. The derivative of the likelihood concerning λ0 is calculated

numerically using the jacobian function from R package pracma. Hence, it is sampled using the

HMC algorithm too.

As the parameter spaces of θij’s and ηkj’s have bounded support, we map any Metropolis can-

didate, falling outside of the parameter space back to the nearest boundary point of the parameter

space. The number of leapfrog steps is kept ﬁxed at 30, however, the step size parameter is tuned

to maintain an acceptance rate within the range of 0.6 to 0.8. The step length is reduced if the

acceptance rate is less than 0.6 and increased it if the rate is more than 0.8. This adjustment is

done automatically after every 100 iterations. Due to the increasing complexity of the parameter

space in TVBINGARCH, we propose to update all the parameters involved in ai(·)’s and bk(·)’s

together.

4 Simulation studies

In this section, we study the performance of our proposed Bayesian method in capturing the

true coeﬃcient functions. We explore both TVBARC and TVBINGARCH with some competing

models. It is important to note that, this is to the best of our knowledge ﬁrst work in Poisson

11

autoregression with a time-varying link. Thus, we compare our method with the existing time-

series models with time-constant coeﬃcients for count data and time-varying AR with Gaussian

error. We also examine the estimation accuracy of the coeﬃcient functions to the truth.

The hyperparameters c1 and c2 of the normal prior are all set 100, which makes the prior

informative. We consider 6 equidistant knots for the B-splines. We collect 10000 MCMC samples

and consider the last 5000 as post burn-in samples for inferences. In absence of any alternative

method for time-varying AR(p) model of count-valued data, we shall compare the estimated

functions with the true functions in terms of the posterior estimates of functions along with its

95% pointwise credible bands. The credible bands are calculated from the MCMC samples at

each point t = 1/T, 2/T, . . . , 1. We also compare diﬀerent competing methods in terms of average

4.1 Case 1: TVBARC structure

Here, we consider two model settings p = 1; Xt ∼ Poisson(µ(t/T ) + a1(t/T )Xt−1) and p = 2; Xt ∼

Poisson(µ(t/T ) + a1(t/T )Xt−1 + a2(t/T )Xt−2) for t = 1, . . . , T . Three diﬀerent choices for T have

been considered, T = 100, 500 and 1000. The true functions are,

µ0(x) =10 exp (cid:0) − (x − 0.5)2/0.1(cid:1),

a10(x) =0.3(x − 1)2 + 0.1,

a02(x) =0.4x2 + 0.1.

We compare the estimated functions with the truth for sample size 1000 in Figures 2 and

Figure 3 for the models p = 1 and p = 2 respectively. Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the performance

of our method with respect to other competing methods.

4.2 Case 2: TVBINGARCH structure

For the tvINGARCH case, we only consider one simulation settings p = 1, q = 1; Xt ∼ Poisson(µ(t/T )+

a1(t/T )Xt−1 + b1(t/T )λt−1). Two diﬀerent choices for T have been considered, T = 100 and 200,

µ0(x) =25 exp (cid:0) − (x − 0.5)2/0.1(cid:1),

a1(x) =0.4x2 + 0.1,

in (2.9) with p = 1, q = 1. The performance of our method is compared to other competing

methods in Tables 3.

green.

Figure 2 to 4 shows that our proposed Bayesian method captures the true functions quite well

for both of the two simulation experiments. We ﬁnd that the estimation accuracy improves as the

sample size increases. As the sample size grows, the 95% credible bands are also getting tighter,

implying lower uncertainty in estimation. This gives empirical evidence in favor of the estimation

consistency Even though the credible intervals form a very useful tool to build pointwise inference

for the time-trajectory of these coeﬃcient functions, we do not report the coverage probability

here. The average mean square error (AMSE) is always the lowest for our method in Tables 1, 2

and 3. For the Poisson distribution, mean and variance are the same. Since µ0(x) is around 10

for simulation case 4.1, the optimal AMSE will be around 10, which is achieved by our method.

Similarly for simulation case 4.2, the optimal AMSE is expected to be around 25.

5 COVID-19 data application

We collect the data of new aﬀected cases for every day from 23rd January to 14th April from an

open-source platform {https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset}.

Table 4 provide a summary of total aﬀected cases along with the number of recovered and de-

ceased for three most aﬀected countries along with Hubei, New York City (NYC) and Seoul,

South Korea. Seoul is selected in the analysis for its unique approach to curbing the outbreak by

implementing an aggressive testing strategy. Hubei, Italy and NYC enforced region-wide strict

lockdown on January 23rd, March 10th, and March 20th respectively. The US, in general, has

implemented selective lockdowns across the country.South Korea took an alternative measure to

track the movements of all aﬀected individuals and to conduct tests for COVID-19 for as many

15

countrymen as possible.

We ﬁt the TVBARC model in (2.1) with p = 10 and the TVINGARCH model in (2.9) with

p = 1, q = 1 for the selected set of countries. The hyperparameters are the same as in the Section 4.

We collect 5000 post-burn samples for inference after burn-in 5000 MCMC samples. We calculate

derivatives of the estimated functions using derivatives of B-splines (De Boor, 2001). Note that

the conﬁdence bands around the estimated curves provide an uncertainty quantiﬁcation and oﬀer

us to objectively decide on statistically testing certain time-trends.

We compile square-root average MSE (AMSE) scores for diﬀerent methods in Table 5. One

can see all the time-varying methods are doing exceptionally better compared to the time-constant

methods. This is not surprising since the spread distribution shows signiﬁcant time-nonstationarity.

Interestingly, one of the two Bayesian methods we proposed in this paper stands out as the best

ﬁt. We analyzed three countries, two cities and the earliest epicenter Hubei separately in our

analysis. The mechanism of spread in these regions behave a little diﬀerently due to population

density, government interference, travel, etc. However, some patterns are very eminently similar

to all these regions.

Intercept trend: The trend function µ(·) behaves very similarly for US (Fig 5), Spain (Fig 9)

diﬀerent for Seoul (Fig 15) and very diﬀerent for Hubei (Fig 11). Since this analysis is using the

data post Jan 23, whereas the ﬁrst set of infections in Hubei was in mid-December, it is natural

that the peak has occurred sometimes earlier and thus the decreasing trend. The slightly bimodal

nature for Seoul looks interesting however this might be due to the relatively smaller numbers for

Seoul. One can also ﬁnd similarity in the number of days to reach a peak after strict lockdown

has been enforced. Our estimate puts it around 15-20 days.

AR(1) function: Note that, at a country level, for each of the US, Spain, and Italy, the

estimated lag 1 coeﬃcient a1(·) were not large and generally did not vary much over time. However,

the pattern is very diﬀerent for the cities as one can see this coeﬃcient dominates the other lags

signiﬁcantly. Hubei and Seoul showed a declining curve with periodic peaks however for NYC,

there was an initial decline, possibly due to the low values around February. But since the

beginning of March, the a1(·) grew very steadily which means the infection was spreading in an

exponential fashion which matches the empirical numbers we observed in this time-frame. The

peak for the mean function µ(·) is downward at present but the worrying sign is the upward

nature of a1(·). Interestingly one can see since the lockdown was imposed strictly on March 20 in

New York, a1 has declined and thus it is not unfair to conclude that this measure has helped in

prohibiting the rate of spread. This also explains why we see similar patterns in Hubei and Seoul

for the AR(1) function. Also, a natural question is why we do not observe this at a country level.

A possible explanation is that the countries are more heterogeneous and with varying degrees of

initial infection and local interference.

Important lag: The TVBARC model for the US and Italy shows interestingly the sixth lag

is dominating lag 1 or 2 almost uniformly. We think this is an extremely important ﬁnd as this

matches medical research that talks about the incubation period of the virus. The number of days

17

required for the symptoms to show up after an infection has been spread is currently being widely

researched and this incubation day has been proposed to have a median of 6 days and a 98%

quantile of 11 days, see Lauer et al. (2020b). Our ﬁnding is coherent with this. This direction of

research could potentially be transformative since while estimating the basic reproduction number,

there is no result, to the best of our knowledge that could estimate the lag between symptom onset

between infector and infectee from the data itself.

TVBINGARCH model: Finally, we conclude our discussion of real data analysis with a very

comprehensive model such as INGARCH. Even for INGARCH(1,1) model, the single additional

recursive parameter b1(·) in light of model (2.9) allows us for an excellent ﬁt instead of ﬁnding

the number of lags up to which one should ﬁt. From Fig 6, 8 and 10, one can see there is a

striking similarity between the three countries the US, Spain, and Italy for the AR(1) and CH(1)

parameter curves. Hubei (Fig 12) and NYC (Fig 14) show similarity while Seoul (Fig 16) has

a diﬀerent pattern for the CH(1) parameter. Many of these curves have multiple local peaks

which corroborate well with the numbers also ﬂuctuating a little bit while ﬂattening out. More

interestingly, for all the 6 ﬁgures one can see the CH(1) parameter is currently having an upward

trend while the intercept trend µ(·) is going down. This dichotomy is an interesting ﬁnd and

can be corroborated with the fact that for a Poisson random variable the intensity parameter is

both the mean and variance. While the mean, in general, is going down the variability for small

numbers is somewhat relatively more.

We also provide the estimated derivatives of the estimated µ(·) functions in Fig 17. Overall,

we believe that our analysis of data from three countries and three populated cities depicts a

comprehensive picture of the mechanism of virus spread.

6 Discussion and Conclusion

We propose a time-varying Bayesian autoregressive model for counts (TVBARC) and time-varying

Bayesian integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic model (TVBIN-

GARCH) with linear link function within Poisson to study the time series of daily new con-

ﬁrmed cases of COVID-19. We develop a novel hierarchical Bayesian model that satisﬁes the

stability condition for the respective time-varying models and propose an HMC algorithm based

MCMC sampling scheme. The ‘R’ function with an example code can be found at https:

//github.com/royarkaprava/TVBARC. Relying on the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model,

one can develop a time-varying Bayesian model for positive-valued time-series data too.

We summarize our main ﬁndings from the analysis of COVID-19 datasets here. First, we

address the time-varying nature of the dataset that takes care of not only how the virus spreads

but also diﬀerent executive restrictions or government interference. It is a diﬃcult task to pour in

other covariates as ﬁrst it is debatable exactly what to include and second diﬀerent countries, the

province even the residents probably behave diﬀerently. To keep the ﬂexibility of how the numbers

evolve outside the autoregressive eﬀects we choose to keep a mean/intercept coeﬃcient µ(·). With

that model set-up, we analyze three diﬀerent countries and three cites. We ﬁnd out interesting

similarities between how the µ(·) behaves over time and see that typically there is a downward

trend after around 12 days after lockdown measures have been enforced. However, for the AR(1)

coeﬃcient, the trends often show multiple peaks probably due to the asymptomatic spreading

capability of the virus. On the same note, another interesting ﬁnd is to see how we ﬁnd lag

number 6-7th to be important in the majority of the cases conforming to the facts published about

the incubation period length of coronavirus. We also propose an INGARCH model which is more

comprehensive than just an AR model and observed an interesting phenomenon in both simulation

and real-data analysis. We saw that from a predictive perspective we cannot say the INGARCH

25

always dominates an AR model and also when we settle for a small order INGARCH model we

tend to lose out on the interesting 6-7th lag phenomenon that is prevalent with this disease for

many cities and countries. However, time-varying INGARCH can be useful in summarizing the

coeﬃcients more compactly.

There is growing skepticism in the various ﬁnding of R0, the basic reproduction number of the

pandemic. These are derived from the popular SIR model but, due to the huge non-stationary

propagation of the data, it is heavily dependent on start and end time. Also, the lags for symptom

onset between an infector and infectee is diﬃcult to estimate and often done not from the data

itself, but SARS and MERS. We do not think this is a correct approach since the dynamics of

virus spread for COVID-19 has been diﬀerent. Thus we oﬀer a diﬀerent approach rather than

having R0 in our model. However if one wants to make an explicit connection, one can propose

the ‘time-varying R0’ model extending from Obadia et al. (2012) as,

Xt|Ft−1 ∼ Poi(λt), λt = R(t)

∞
(cid:88)

i=1

Xt−iwi

one can see this is very similar to saying ai(t/T ) = R(t)wi. Moreover, the interesting ﬁnd in our

paper allows us to highlight that the weights wi have a high concentration around lag 6. This

alternative way of using the data itself to re-estimate the reproduction number can be transfor-

mative.

As future work, it will be interesting to include some country-speciﬁc information such as

demographic information, geographical area, the eﬀect of environmental time-series, etc in the

model. These are usually important factors for the spread of any infectious disease. We can also

categorize the diﬀerent types of government intervention eﬀects to elaborate more on the speciﬁc

impacts of the same. In the future we wish to analyze the number of deaths, number of recovered

cases, number of severe/critical cases, etc. for these diseases as those will hopefully have diﬀerent

dynamics than the one considered here and can provide useful insights about the spread and

measures required. For computational ease, we have considered same level of smoothness for all

the coeﬃcient functions. Fitting this model with diﬀerent levels of smoothness might be able to

provide more insights. Other than building time-varying autoregressive models for positive-valued

data using the hierarchical structure from this article, one interesting future direction is to extend

this model for vector-valued count data. In general, it is diﬃcult to model multivariate count data.

There are only a limited number of methods to deal with multivariate count data (Besag, 1974;

26

Yang et al., 2013; Roy and Dunson, 2019). Building on these multivariate count data models,

one can extend our time-varying univariate AR(p) to a time-varying vector-valued AR(p). On

the same note, even though we imposed Poisson assumption for increased model interpretation,

in the light of the upper bounds for the KL distance, it is not a necessary criterion and can be

applied to a general multiple non-stationary count time-series. Extending some of the continuous

time-series invariance results from Karmakar and Wu (2020) to multiple count time-series will be

an interesting challenge. Finally, we wish to undertake an autoregressive estimation of the basic

reproduction number with the time-varying version of compartmental models in epidemiology

immediately.
