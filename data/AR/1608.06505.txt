ABSTRACT
Burst-like events with signatures in the UV are often observed co-spatial to strong
line-of-sight photospheric magnetic ﬁelds. Several authors, for example, have noted the
spatial relationship between Ellerman bombs (EBs) and Moving Magnetic Features
(MMFs), regions of ﬂux which disconnect from a sunspot or pore before propagating
away in the moat ﬂow and often displaying evidence of cancellation. In this article, data
collected by the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly are analysed in an attempt to understand the potential
links between such cancellation and UV burst formation. Two MMFs from AR 11579,
three bi-poles from AR 11765, and six bi-poles (four of which were co-spatial to IRIS
bursts) in AR 11850 were identiﬁed for analysis. All of these cancellation features
were found to have lifetimes of the order hours and cancellation rates of the order
1014-1015 Mx s−1. Hα line wing data from the Dunn Solar Telescope’s Interferometric
BIdimensional Spectrometer were also available for AR 11579 facilitating a discussion
of links between MMFs and EBs. Using an algebraic model of photospheric magnetic
reconnection, the measured cancellation rates are then used to ascertain estimates of
certain quantities (such as up-ﬂow speeds, jet extents, and potential energy releases)
which compared reasonably to the properties of EBs reported within the literature.
Our results suggest that cancellation rates of the order measured here are capable of
supplying enough energy to drive certain UV bursts (including EBs), however, they
are not a guaranteeing condition for burst formation.

INTRODUCTION

Small-scale burst-like features with signatures in the UV
spectrum have been widely researched in the litera-
ture. Ellerman Bombs (EBs; Ellerman 1917), for exam-
ple, are small-scale brightening events, originally observed
in the wings of the Hα line proﬁle, which, until recently
(see Rouppe van der Voort et al. 2016), were thought to
form uniquely within Active Regions (ARs). Recent re-
searches have also, however, associated EBs with 1600
˚A and 1700 ˚A continuum intensity increases as well a
sub-set of the recently discovered IRIS bursts (see, e.g.:
Peter et al. 2014; Vissers et al. 2015). EBs often mani-
fest as elongated structures with a major axis length
′′
and exhibit dynamic ﬁne sub-structuring
of around 1
(as was discussed by Watanabe et al. 2011, Nelson et al.

2015). The lifetimes of EBs are of the order minutes
(see, for example, Zachariadis et al. 1987, Georgoulis et al.
2002, Watanabe et al. 2011), although,
short-lived in-
tense increases
in brightness and area (presented by
Qiu et al. 2000, Watanabe et al. 2011, Vissers et al. 2015)
have been suggested to be indicative of a high-energy driver,
widely hypothesised to be photospheric magnetic reconnec-
tion (recently researched by, e.g., Georgoulis et al. 2002,
Vissers et al. 2013, Nelson et al. 2013).

Photospheric magnetic reconnection could prove to be
an important process in driving numerous features from
the lower solar atmosphere into the outer reaches of the
Sun, including certain spicules (de Pontieu et al. 2007), ﬁl-
aments (Litvinenko & Martin 1999, Litvinenko et al. 2007),
surges (Roy 1973), and the recently discovered IRIS bursts
(Peter et al. 2014). Georgoulis et al. (2002) presented three
cartoon magnetic ﬁeld topologies, one of which agrees well
with the expected magnetic topology of Moving Magnetic

SDO/HMI instrument (top row) and the SDO/AIA 1700 ˚A ﬁlter (bottom row). Positive polarity is indicated by white pixels and
negative polarity is indicated by black pixels. Each of the magnetograms and each of the 1700 ˚A images are artiﬁcially saturated at ±300
G and 6000 counts, respectively, for ease of comparison. The ordering of the ARs from left to right is: AR 11579; AR 11765; AR 11850.
Approximate spatial locations of the UV bursts discussed in this article are indicated by the white numbers in the SDO/AIA 1700 ˚A
panels.

Features (MMFs; Sheeley 1969, Harvey & Harvey 1973,
Lim et al. 2012), which could facilitate the formation of UV
bursts (assuming these features were a product of magnetic
reconnection). Indeed, correlations between EBs and MMFs
have been found (see, for example, Nindos & Zirin 1998)
meaning the relationship between these features could be
worthy of continued study. One potential avenue of research,
followed in this article, is the measurement and subsequenst
analysis of the often cited cancellation rates of MMFs (re-
cently researched by Li & Zhang 2013) and other bi-polar
regions co-spatial with a range of UV bursts.

The development of analytical tools which have at-
tempted to model photospheric Sweet-Parker reconnec-
tion (Parker 1957; Sweet 1958) by Litvinenko (1999) and
Litvinenko et al. (2007) have now made the measurement of
such cancellation rates co-spatial to a variety of UV bursts
desirable. In this article, the observed properties of can-
celling bi-poles are recorded before being inputted into the
model developed by Litvinenko (1999) in order to assert
whether realistic outputs, comparable with observations of
UV bursts (for example, the upward ﬂow velocity of EBs
−1 observed by Nelson et al. 2015),
measured to be 9 km s
are returned. Such comparisons are important for testing

both the models and the magnetic reconnection hypothesis
as the driver of certain UV bursts.

The method developed by Litvinenko (1999) has so far
provided interesting results with regards to ﬁlament and
EUV jet formation (see, for example, Litvinenko & Martin
1999, Chae et al. 2003) and could, therefore, shed light on
the sporadic relationship between EBs and surges reported
in the literature (see, for example, Rust 1968, Yang et al.
2013, Reid et al. 2015). Speciﬁcally, it is of interest to com-
pare any measured cancellation rates co-spatial to UV bursts
to those observed co-spatial to surges (Roy 1973) and EBs
(Reid et al. 2016). If magnetic reconnection were to be the
reason for the observed cancellation, it is possible that the
minimum cancellation rate for EBs to form is lower than the
minimum required for surge formation, potentially explain-
ing the plethora of observations depicting EBs with no links
to surges.

It should be noted, however, that this study does not
aim to directly address the links between UV bursts and
surges. Any process which could potentially link such events
is still open to discussion and would likely require the combi-
nation of observations with realistic numerical simulations
beyond the scope of the present article. A number of re-

30-frame speckle, and 10-frame speckle sequences (described in more detail in the text), respectively. It should be noted that the initial
implementation of sequence ‘A’ corresponds to the data analysed in Nelson et al. (2013) (with a slight diﬀerence in the timing due to the
discounting of time between the sequence initialisation and data acquisition and the inclusion of four frames at the end of the sequence
which were removed from the previous article due to poor seeing).

searches have, though, hypothesised that shock waves, ex-
cited by a reconnection event such as an EB in the lower so-
lar atmosphere, could act to raise the chromospheric-coronal
separating layer, hence leading to the ejection of mass as a
surge (see, for example, Suematsu et al. 1982, Shibata et al.
1982, Takasao et al. 2013).

The work contained within this article is structured as
follows: In Section 2, the relevant observations are presented.
The identiﬁcation of relevant cancellation features, their ba-
sic properties, and their links to UV bursts are described
in Section 3, before the ﬁndings are incorporated into the
models of Litvinenko (1999) and Litvinenko et al. (2007) in
Section 4. Finally, a discussion about the relevance of these
results is conducted in Section 5.

2 OBSERVATIONS

2.1 AR 11579

The ﬁrst ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) discussed in this article was
sampled within NOAA AR 11579 on the 30th Septem-
ber 2012 between 14:00 UT and 17:00 UT. Ground-based
data were collected using the Interferometric BIdimensional
Spectrometer (IBIS; Cavallini & IBIS Team 2004) instru-
ment at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) with an 80′′ cir-
cular diameter centred on the leading sunspot of the AR,
′′
′′
, yc ≈ −275
intially situated at co-ordinates of xc ≈ 28
(with respect to the disc centre; µ=0.96). The spatial reso-
′′
lution of these data is approximately 0.2
. Co-spatial line-of-
sight photospheric magnetic ﬁelds were inferred using Solar
Dynamics Observatory’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(SDO/HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) data, which were down-
loaded, reduced, and cropped to a 100
box centred on
the DST/IBIS FOV. Co-alignment was achieved by match-
ing bright regions in the Hα line wings (hypothesised to be
a good proxy of the vertical magnetic ﬁeld by, for example,
Rutten et al. 2013) with small-scale magnetic ﬁeld elements
in the SDO/HMI images. Finally, data collected by the 1700
˚A, 1600 ˚A, and 304 ˚A ﬁlters on the Solar Dynamics Obser-
vatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA; Lemen
2012) were downloaded and aligned to provide information
about the local UV and EUV signals. The initial magnetic
conﬁguration of this FOV and the co-spatial 1700 ˚A struc-
turing are plotted in the ﬁrst column of Fig. 1 for reference.
Overall, this region remained relatively stable through time,

however, a steady stream of MMFs were observed to ﬂow
away from the sunspot, many of which exhibited cancella-
tion.

Three distinct observational routines (which shall be
denoted as ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ for ease) were employed by
the DST/IBIS instrument over a two-hour period between
14:34:19 UT and 16:32:50 UT. Routine ‘A’ comprised a 17-
point Hα line scan and a 9-point Fe I 6302.5 ˚A line scan,
neither of which sampled with even spacing through the
proﬁles. The minimum and maximum wavelengths of the
observed Hα line proﬁle were −0.99 ˚A and +1.01 ˚A from
6562.8 ˚A, respectively. The Fe I 6302.5 ˚A data are not anal-
ysed in this article and so will not be discussed further. In
total, 26 images were taken per sequence repetition with a
cadence of approximately 5.4 seconds. Routine ‘B’ imaged
the wings of the Hα line proﬁle at only −0.74 ˚A and +0.76
˚A, acquiring 30 frames at each line position with a total of
60 frames per repetition. Each set of 30 frames was then
reduced using the speckle method (see W¨oger et al. 2008)
returning data with a total cadence of around 6.8 seconds.
Finally, routine ‘C’ is similar to routine ‘B’ except that each
line position was only sampled 10 times, giving a total of 20
frames per repetition at a cadence of 2.4 seconds. A sum-
mary of the two-hour period of observations can be found
in Table 1.

and yc ≈ 143

The second region of interest to this study is AR 11765,
which has previously been shown to contain around 20 EBs
during the hour-long observations analysed by Hong et al.
FOV (initially centred on co-ordinates
(2014). A 100
′′
xc ≈ −142
; µ = 0.98) was isolated and
tracked for a two hour period between 16:00 UT and 18:00
UT on the 6th June 2013 (encompassing the temporal cov-
erage researched by Hong et al. 2014) when the region was
still in its emerging phase. This region contained numerous
sunspots/pores of both positive and negative polarity in ad-
dition to a high number of network elements and dynamic
burst-like events, which appeared to show signiﬁcant evolu-
tion of their structuring through this two hour period. As
with AR 11765, line-of-sight magnetic ﬁelds were inferred us-
ing the SDO/HMI instrument and the co-spatial UV/EUV
emission was inferred using SDO/AIA 1700 ˚A, 1600 ˚A, and
304 ˚A data. The majority of burst-like events within this

FOV occurred co-spatial to apparent horizontal structuring
(potentially similar to ﬁbrils commonly observed within the
Hα line core) observed within the 304 ˚A ﬁlter which appear
to cover the centre of the AR. The initial line-of-sight mag-
netic ﬁeld and 1700 ˚A ﬁlter response within this FOV are
plotted in the middle column of Fig. 1.

2.3 AR 11850

′′×100

The third region used as a test for this article is AR 11850.
This AR was of interest for this research due to the exis-
tence of IRIS UV bursts co-spatial to measurable cancella-
tion, discussed by Peter et al. (2014). A 100
FOV
(original co-ordinates: xc ≈ −271, yc ≈ 59; µ = 0.96) was
selected and tracked for a two-hour period between 11:00
UT and 13:00 UT on the 24th September 2013. Several
sunspots/pores are evident within the FOV, in addition to
a variety of ﬂux emergence and cancellation events (some of
which are co-spatial to the events analysed by Peter et al.
2014) typical of an emerging AR. The initial line-of-sight
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration and 1700 ˚A SDO/AIA ﬁlter re-
sponse co-spatial to this FOV are plotted in the right hand
column of Fig. 1.

3 DATA ANALYSIS

3.1 Tracking and Feature Identiﬁcation

As the main focus of this article is on the relationship
between cancellation features and UV bursts, it was ﬁrst
necessary to identify a method to track potential bi-poles
which were suﬃciently isolated through time such that ac-
curate measurements of their properties (e.g., magnetic ﬁeld
strength) could be made. The tracking of magnetic fea-
tures within these datasets was completed using Yet Another
Feature Tracking Algorithm (YAFTA; Welsch & Longcope
2003), which required minimum thresholding of both mag-
netic ﬁeld strength and area as inputs. In this study, these
thresholds were set at 40 G and 2 pixels (0.5′′×1′′), respec-
tively, through a systematic testing of a variety of param-
eters with the aim of securing a successful and consistent
identiﬁcation of small-scale ﬂux elements. The magnetic ﬁeld
strength, area, and cross-sectional diameter (taken to be
length of the ‘current sheet’ in Section 4) of all regions of
interest could then be recorded for each relevant frame and
saved in individual ﬁles for further analysis.

After the tracking method had been ﬁnalised, numerous
examples of cancellation were identiﬁed within each FOV
(including features co-spatial to the potential EBs discussed
in Nelson et al. 2013 [AR 11579] and IRIS bursts discussed
by Peter et al. 2014 [AR 11850]). These cancellation features
could be split into three individual categories, namely: (1)
Isolated regions of cancellation spatially separated from any
other measured ﬂux; (2) Cancellation which merged with
other small regions of ﬂux during the lifetime of the bi-pole;
(3) Cancellation of one small, uni-polar ﬂux region against
a larger body of opposite polarity network. Intuitively, fea-
tures within the second category must be disregarded for
this study due to a masking of the cancellation by the merg-
ing ﬂux. Overall, eleven representative cancellation features

tensity increases, however, the Hα blue wing saturated at 150 % of
the background intensity (−0.74 ˚A; third row) displays higher in-
tensity increases. The bottom row plots the magnetic ﬂux through
time for MMF 1, with the ﬁrst and second dashed lines indicating
the onset and disappearance of the intensity increase in the Hα
line wings, respectively.

polarity in the SDO/HMI magnetograms (top row) which occurs co-spatial to increases in intensity within the SDO/AIA 1700 ˚A and
1600 ˚A ﬁlters (second and third rows, respectively). The SDO/AIA 304 ˚A ﬁlter shows no evidence of a co-spatial or co-temporal response
to this localised cancellation. The images in each row are plotted with an artiﬁcial saturation level of ±300 G, 8000 counts, 2500 counts,
and 2000 counts (from top to bottom, respectively). The left-hand column is plotted at the closest time-step to 16:23:09 UT. Each

were identiﬁed within these datasets for analysis, includ-
ing two small-scale MMFs from AR 11579 (not co-spatial to
those analysed by Nelson et al. 2013), three larger cancelling
bi-poles from AR 11765, and six bi-poles (four of which were
co-spatial to the IRIS bursts discussed by Peter et al. 2014)
in AR 11850. In order to be consistent throughout our anal-
ysis, a single representative polarity was selected for each
event and measured through time in order to infer the can-
cellation rate of the region.

Following the detection of cancellation features, the co-
spatial and co-temporal SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A imag-
ing data were studied to conﬁrm whether a UV burst was
present (threshold values of 2500 counts and 8000 counts, re-
spectively, which were deemed suitable across all datasets).
Nomenclature deﬁning speciﬁc UV bursts is an important
and a non-trivial matter, with a variety of features being as-
sociated with comparable increases in emission. EBs for ex-
ample, especially for relatively disk-centre observations such
as those presented here (in order to gain a high-accuracy
magnetic ﬁeld dataset), can be diﬃcult to distinguish from

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–13

magnetic concentrations in the Hα line wings (as has re-
cently been discussed by Rutten et al. 2013, Vissers et al.
2013, Vissers et al. 2015). Here, therefore, the focus will be
on physical quantities of any UV bursts (such as area, life-
time, intensity increase) which can be compared across these
datasets as well as back to typical values of EBs in the liter-
ature. It should be noted that no direct attribution of these
UV features to previously discussed events (such as EBs)
will be attempted and that we shall stick to the more gen-
eral term of UV bursts. Finally, the SDO/AIA 304 ˚A data
were studied to determine whether any co-spatial EUV sig-
nal was present.

3.2 AR 11579

The ﬁrst feature analysed in this article (hereafter referred to
as MMF 1) propagated away from the North-West portion of
the penumbra of the sunspot between 14:45 UT and 16:00
UT. Prior to the measured cancellation, a large region of
positive polarity ﬂux fragmented, before one of the segments

6

C. J. Nelson et al.

interacted with a region of emerging negative polarity ﬂux.
Both regions of polarity then cancelled suﬃciently through
time such that they were no longer observable in SDO/HMI
magnetogram data. The morphological properties of MMF
2 (identiﬁable South-East of the sunspot between 15:50 UT
and 16:40 UT) were similar to those demonstrated by MMF
1. Initially, a region of positive polarity ﬂux was observed
to fragment from a larger body close to the sunspot before
interacting with an emerging negative polarity ﬂux segment.
These identiﬁed MMFs were typical examples of such
features (as originally discussed by Sheeley 1969 and within
the large statistical sample analysed by Li & Zhang 2013).
Both MMF 1 and MMF 2 had cross-sectional diameters of
around 2-3 Mm, original ﬂux measurements of the order 1018
Mx, and lifetimes of around one hour meaning any proper-
ties derived from these features should be suitable to be
extrapolated to a larger body of events. In Fig. 2, the FOV
co-spatial to MMF 1 is plotted for the SDO/HMI line-of-
sight magnetic ﬁeld (top row), the SDO/AIA 1700 ˚A ﬁlter
(second row; artiﬁcal threshold of 6000 counts), and the Hα
blue wing (third row; saturated at 150 % of the background
intensity) depicting the identiﬁed bi-pole and apparent Hα
intensity increase. In the bottom panel, the magnetic ﬂux is
also plotted highlighting an obvious decrease through time.
The black line in the top frame indicates the estimated cross-
sectional diameter and the dashed lines in the bottom frame
indicate the onset and disappearance of any observed Hα
intensity increases (not necessarily above a 150 % value).
Measuring the ﬂuxes of these MMFs through time, it was
possible to ﬁnd cancellation rates, R, of 4.1 × 1014 Mx s−1
−1 for MMFs 1 and 2, respectively. Ap-
and 6.4 × 1014 Mx s
proximate widths of the bi-poles, l, are found to be 3.1 Mm
and 2.1 Mm, again respectively. In the following sections,
these values shall be put in context, however, initially a brief
discussion of the imaging data co-spatial to these events will
be conducted.

The Hα emission features co-spatial to both MMFs 1
and 2 were, in many ways, similar to EBs, with diame-
′′
ters of slightly over 1
, lifetimes of approximately 10 min-
utes, and occasional increases in intensity over 150 % of the
background intensity (comparable to events discussed by,
for example, Zachariadis et al. 1987, Georgoulis et al. 2002,
Nelson et al. 2015). Initially, both features manifested as rel-
atively small, weak brightenings in the Hα line wings, before
displaying dynamical morphological evolutions. It is inter-
esting to note that for both features, the Hα wings only
exhibited emission for a small section of time during which
cancellation was observed. This increased intensity corre-
sponded well to the period of greatest cancellation although
no ﬁrm conclusions can be drawn on the relevance or gener-
ality of this due to our small sample size of MMFs.

Whether these increases in the Hα wing emission are
EBs or the more common magnetic concentrations (as were
discussed by Rutten et al. 2013) is diﬃcult to ascertain due
to the changing intensity thresholds from observing sequence
to sequence. As this FOV includes only limited ﬂux emer-
gence and a light ﬂow of MMFs, it is unfortunately also
not possible to quantify the percentage of MMFs which cor-
respond to Hα intensity increases (such as was conducted
by Nindos & Zirin 1998). We do note that each of the fur-
ther obvious bi-polar MMFs (which fell into category 2; i.e.,
interacted with apparently emerging ﬂux during their life-

times) observed within these SDO/HMI data corresponds
to at least some limited brightening activity in the Hα line
wings, but whether this was due to the increased Hα wing
emission associated with magnetic concentrations or due to
the occurrence of EBs is unknown. A longer continuous ob-
serving sequence should be analysed in more detail in future
research in order to further understand this.

Recent work by Vissers et al. (2013) and Vissers et al.
(2015) has indicated that identifying burst-like behaviour in
the SDO/AIA UV channels is an excellent method for con-
ﬁrming detections of EBs. The 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A emis-
sions co-spatial to these cancellation events were, there-
fore, examined in an attempt to draw further inferences
about the nature of the Hα line wing intensity increases.
The SDO/AIA UV emission co-spatial and co-temporal
to these MMFs were relatively limited, with some short-
lived increases in intensity but no major burst-like emission
observed (over the thresholds discussed previously). It is,
therefore, possible that any increases in emission within the
Hα line co-spatial to these cancellation events is related to
the more benign magnetic concentrations (see, for exam-
ple, Rutten et al. 2013) rather than explosive EBs. In addi-
tion to this, no signature of burst-like events was observed
in the SDO/AIA 304 ˚A channel, although this would also
be expected for EBs (see, for example, Vissers et al. 2013,
Nelson et al. 2015).

3.3 AR 11765

The FOV studied within AR 11765 appeared to be a more
dynamic environment then AR 11579 with a higher number
of ﬂux emergence and cancellation events occurring within
the analysed two-hour time period. The ﬁrst cancellation
event discussed here (referred to as Can. Event 1) was ob-
served at initial (from the original frame) co-ordinates of

Two regions of ﬂux, one positive and one negative, began
to approach one another at around 16:20 UT before the
negative polarity ﬁeld fully cancelled away. The evolution
of this feature is plotted in Fig. 3 for reference. The sec-
ond feature (Can. Event 2) suitable for analysis within these

ﬁeld before rapidly cancelling away. The ﬁnal bi-pole of in-
terest in AR 11765 (Can. Event 3) occurred in an appar-

Event 3, in turn was slightly longer lived. Interestingly, all

ters of these events during the cancellation were 2.6 Mm, 2.5
Mm, and 2.3 Mm. The evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld con-
tained within the negative polarity poles of Can. Events 1
and 2 is plotted in the top row of Fig. 4 and strongly depicts
this cancellation.

Analysis of the SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A ﬁlters
highlighted strong increases in intensity co-spatial and co-
temporal to both Can. Event 1 (as is displayed in Fig. 3)
and Can. Event 2. Indeed, both of these interacting bi-poles
occurred co-spatial to one of the two most intense features
observed within this FOV during this time-period by the
1700 ˚A ﬁlter. The UV burst co-spatial to Can. Event 1
occurred between 17:00 UT and 17:50 UT with a cross-
sectional diameter of the order 4 Mm, and exhibited sev-
eral impulsive brightenings followed by a short fading. The
UV burst co-spatial to Can. Event 2, however, had a peak
width of around 5 Mm and was much more dynamic with

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–13

several apparent kernels forming over numerous impulsive
phases. Lightcurves for 7 × 7 pixel boxes encompassing these
events are plotted in the middle and bottom rows of Fig. 4.
Interestingly, when the lightcurves for Can. Event 2 are
compared to the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld plotted
in the top row of Fig. 4, each sustained intensity increase
appears to be linked to a period of strong cancellation.
One obvious example of this is the UV burst at approxi-
mately 17:00 UT in the lightcurve for Can. Event 2. Overall,
these lightcurves appear to match the signatures detected
by Vissers et al. (2015) co-spatial to EBs and Flaring Arch
Filaments (FAFs).

Interestingly, no UV or EUV burst was detected co-
spatial to Can. Event 3 despite the comparable cancella-
tion rates. A number of explanations are available to ac-
count for the lack of observed UV burst including, but not
limited to, the low viewing angle masking the formation of
any event against the background magnetic concentrations
(as has been discussed by Rutten et al. 2013, Vissers et al.
2013), that this event forms as a sub-class of cancellation

which does not display strong evidence of a co-spatial UV
burst, and that any burst behaviour occurred below the tem-
poral resolution of the SDO/AIA UV ﬁlters. A larger sam-
ple of cancellation features, co-temporally sampled in the
Hα line wings, would be required to further investigate any
such possibilities.

3.4 AR 11850

During the two-hour period analysed in this article, the FOV
studied within AR 11850 was also very dynamic with nu-
merous ﬂux emergence and cancellation events being ob-
served. Peter et al. (2014) discussed four IRIS bursts which
occurred between 11:44 UT and 12:04 UT co-spatial to bi-
polar magnetic ﬁelds. Over the course of the two hours, all
four of these regions clearly show some level of cancellation
meaning they are suitable for analysis here. We shall, there-
fore, adopt the same numbering convention for these events
as Peter et al. (2014).

For these UV bursts, cancellation rates can be derived
using the method previously implemented on both AR 11579
and AR 11765. Values for the cancellation rate, R, were
−1, 1.5 × 1015 Mx s

found to be 1.8 × 1015 Mx s
−1 for events 1 to 4, respectively.
−1, and 1.5×1015 Mx s
Mx s
These measurements were made for the positive polarity ﬂux
for events 2 and 3 and the negative polarity ﬂux for events 1
and 4. Overall, these values correspond well to the cancella-
tion rates measured for Can. Events 1, 2, and 3 within AR
11765. Cross-sectional diameters were estimated to be 2.2
Mm, 2.6 Mm, 3.5 Mm, and 2.2 Mm, once again for events
1 to 4, respectively. The negative polarity ﬂux contained
within bi-polar Events 1 and 4 is plotted through time in
the top row of Fig. 5.

Of these four cancelling bi-poles, three (events 1, 3, and
4) formed co-spatial to strong UV bursts in both the 1600
˚A and 1700 ˚A ﬁlters similar to the ﬁrst two events discussed
within AR 11765. Of these events, the burst correspond-
ing to event 3 appeared to be the weakest with only short-
lived measureable intensity enhancements, observed early on
during the analysed time-period. The UV bursts co-spatial
to events 1 and 4, however, were repetitive, with numerous
impulsive brightening phases observed during the course of
these data. Average lightcurves (again calculated for a 7 × 7
pixel box) surrounding these UV bursts are plotted in the
middle and bottom rows of Fig. 5. These lightcurves illus-
trate the strong impulsive behaviour observed, speciﬁcally
within the 1600 ˚A ﬁlters.

The UV continuum co-spatial to Event 2 displayed no
such behaviour, with no intensity increases above the cur-
rent thresholds. In terms of cancellation rates and 304 ˚A
response, no diﬀerence between this event and the other
features analysed in for this FOV is discernible. It is pos-
sible, as with the FAFs discussed by Vissers et al. (2015),
that the energy deposition relating to this event could occur
higher in the atmosphere but still below the chromospheric
canopy, limiting both the photospheric (1700 ˚A) and chro-
mospheric (304 ˚A) response. This lack of UV burst co-spatial
to the IRIS burst is interesting and deserving of future re-
search, potentially conducted using co-spatial IRIS spec-
tra and magnetograms collected using the CRisp Imaging
SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP; Scharmer 2006, Scharmer et al.
2008).

In addition to the features

studied in detail by
Peter et al. (2014), six further UV bursts were identiﬁed
during this time period, each of which was co-spatial to a
bi-pole. Four of these features occurred within the conﬁnes
of the region of apparent ﬂux emergence at the centre of
the FOV and were, therefore, not suitable for analysis in
this article. Interestingly, one of these events is clearly vis-
ible in the SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A channels during
the time period analysed by Peter et al. (2014), however,
no IRIS burst was identiﬁed indicating either no increased
Si IV 1394 ˚A signal was produced at this site or that any
heightened emission was missed by the raster. Cancellation
rates, R, were measured for the two remaining (short-lived)
−1 and
events (denoted as Events 5 & 6) at 5 × 1014 Mx s
−1. The widths of the bi-poles were estimated
1.9×1015 Mx s
to be 1.3 Mm and 2.2 Mm, respectively. For reference, Event

4 MODEL PREDICTIONS

4.1 Application of the Model

This section focuses on the the initial model of Litvinenko
(1999) and the slightly expanded version set out by
Litvinenko et al. (2007). For ease of the reader these mod-
els shall be brieﬂy described here. This analysis assumes
that a vertical current sheet exists in the photosphere be-
tween two opposite polarity regions. The length, thickness,
and height of the current sheet are deﬁned as l, 2a, and
2b (where b ≈ Λ, the atmospheric scale height). The plasma
densities (temperatures) at the entrance to the current sheet
and within the current sheet are denoted as ni (Ti) and n
(T ). In addition to this, the magnetic ﬁeld strength and in-
ﬂow speed at the entrance to the current sheet, the magnetic
ﬁeld strength and in-ﬂow speed outside of the bi-pole and
the current sheet, the out-ﬂow speed away from the current
sheet, and the upward mass ﬂux are written as Bi, vi, Be, ve,
v, and F , respectively. Finally, σ denotes the electric con-
ductivity, mp is the proton mass, k is Boltzmann’s constant,
and c is the speed of light.

measured by Litvinenko et al. (2007). Technically, this
quantity could be measured from observations, however,
the relatively low-resolution of SDO/HMI magnetograms
and the short-lived nature of analysed features would likely
cause errors in any estimate for the events of interest to
this article. Finally, ﬂux build-up is considered such that:

r =

R
l

= Bivi = Beve.

As the VAL-C model is unlikely to accurately portray the
atmospheric conditions co-spatial to an EB (but is suitable
for an initial study as presented here), it would be of interest
to conduct such a study in the future alongside numerical
simulations of photospheric magnetic restructuring (such as
those presented in Nelson et al. 2013).

from
Litvinenko et al. (2007) to estimate the further variables re-
quired to complete this system. It is interesting to consider
that numerous predictions of EBs have suggested that a tem-
perature enhancement occurs at the potential reconnection
site (see, for example, Kitai 1983, Fang et al. 2006 in addi-
tion to the recent work by Vissers et al. 2015 and Rutten
2016). It would, therefore, be of interest to modify this ap-
proximation slightly such that iso-thermal reconnection is
not demanded. We model this basically by including a fur-
ther condition that:

T = Ti + Γ,

(2)

where Γ is a non-zero, positive constant. It should be noted
that this deviation from the iso-thermal model does create
issues with the Equation of State, however, in the interest of
this work, we shall limit Γ to be small such that any errors
are minimalised. Eq. (6) and Eq. (11) from Litvinenko et al.
(2007) can then be rewritten as:

We are now in a position to deﬁne three quantities of in-
terest to this study, namely the up-ﬂow speed of the ejected
plasma, the height of the corresponding jet, and the en-
ergy contained within the magnetic ﬁeld. The up-ﬂow speed
is simply calculated using Eq. (12) from Litvinenko et al.
(2007) which is written as:

v =

Bi
(4πmpn)1/2

(5)

where each of the above variables is returned by the model
for a given cancellation rate and current sheet length (cross-
sectional diameter).

Secondly, Takasao et al. (2013) estimated the maximum
height of a jet from a reconnecting region assuming all of the
kinetic energy were converted into potential energy. This was
written as:
Hjet ∼ Λ
β

(6)

where β is the plasma beta deﬁned as:

β =

B2
est
(8πnkT )

.

(7)

Using the output from the Litvinenko et al. (2007) model,
it is possible to estimate this quantity for each cancellation
feature. We shall use an estimate of Best=200 G in order to
compare between events and with observational results from
Watanabe et al. (2011) and Nelson et al. (2015).

Finally, it is possible to estimate the magnetic energy
contained within the current sheet from the Litvinenko et al.
(2007) model using the relation:

Ei =

B2
i
8π

× V

(8)

where V = l × 2a × 2Λ. This value should be of interest to
compare to predicted EB (see, for example, Georgoulis et al.

2002) and IRIS burst (Peter et al. 2014) energies from
within the literature.

4.2 AR 11579

−3, v ≈ 6.8 km s

Considering MMF 1, the measured and estimated parame-
ters are R = 4.1 × 1014 Mx s−1 and l = 3.1 × 108 cm. When
included in the isothermal (T = 4200 K) Eqs.(6)-(13) from

Litvinenko et al. (2007), output values of vi ≈ 85 m s
Be ≈ 44 G, Bi ≈ 156 G, n ≈ 3.8 × 1015 cm−3, v ≈ 5.5 km

−1 and 6.8 km
Interestingly, the up-ﬂow velocities of 5.6 km s
−1 are comparable to the lower limit of velocities measured
s
close to the limb by Watanabe et al. (2011) and Nelson et al.
(2015). The maximum jet extentions of 137 km and 232
km (estimated from Eq. 6 with an estimated magnetic ﬁeld
of 200 G) are, however, much lower than measured values
for EBs. In addition to this, the potential magnetic ener-
gies available for conversion at the current sheet is esti-
mated to be of the correct order to account for the radiative
losses of weak EBs at Ei ≈ 1024 ergs (as was discussed by
Georgoulis et al. 2002). Assuming an eﬃcient conversion of
this quantity to radiative and kinetic energy over the course
of one second, a maximum energy release over the lifetime
of a typical EB (approximatetly 10 minutes), could be as
high as Emax ≈ 6 × 1026 ergs. A summary of both events is
included in the appropriate row of Table 2.

In Fig. 6, a number of parameters are plotted with re-
spect to temperature at the current sheet for MMF 1. Both
the in-ﬂow velocity and mass ﬂux rate decrease with in-
creased temperature at the current sheet, whereas the ratio
of the current sheet magnetic ﬁeld to the incoming magnetic
ﬁeld and the up-ﬂow velocity both increase at higher temper-
atures. Interestingly, only a large increase in temperature at
the site of the current sheet (around 10000 K, which is higher
than previous semi-empirical estimates of heating within
EBs but of the same order of magnitude as the tempera-
tures estimated by Vissers et al. 2015) raises the predicted
out-ﬂow velocity for this cancellation feature to the average
vertical propagation speed of EBs observed at the limb by
Nelson et al. 2015. The upward mass ﬂux predicted for this
event is an order of magnitude smaller than that predicted
by both Litvinenko & Martin (1999) and Litvinenko et al.
(2007) and the time required to ﬁll a ﬁlament with typical
mass around 5×1016 g (suggested by Litvinenko et al. 2007)
is on the order of 100 hours (two orders of magnitude larger
than the length of cancellation). Of course, small-scale can-
cellation features with lifetimes of less than one hour are
unlikely to prove essential for the formation of ﬁlaments;
however, using the estimates of Bong et al. (2014), the mass
ﬂuxes returned by this model would account for the required
ﬁlling of surges within one minute under ideal conditions
(i.e., no gravity etc.).

2002). The output values returned by the model for the six
cancellation features observed within AR 11850 are similar
to those returned in AR 11579. A brief description of each
of these bi-poles is included in Table. 2.

5 DISCUSSION

In this article, eleven well-deﬁned cancellation events have
been analysed. The overall aim of this research was to fur-
ther understand the potential role of cancellation in UV
burst formation. Initially, two small bi-polar magnetic ﬂux
elements surrounding a sunspot in AR 11579 were identi-
ﬁed and tracked within SDO/HMI data using YAFTA (see
Welsch & Longcope 2003). Co-aligned imaging data (col-
lected by the SDO/AIA and DST/IBIS instruments) sam-
pling the 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A ﬁlters and Hα line wings were
then visually inspected to conﬁrm or deny the formation of
any burst feature. The total magnetic ﬁeld strength of the
representative polarities were also determined by YAFTA
and plotted through time (see the bottom frame of Fig. 2)
in order to interpret whether any cancellation was apparent.
Both of the events analysed in AR 11579 exhibited signiﬁ-
cant cancellation through their lifetimes at rates on the order
of 1014 Mx s

−1.

The values measured for Can. Event 1 within AR 11765
−1 and l = 2.6 × 108 cm, return
of R = 1.6 × 1015 Mx s
slightly larger output values (than those calculated for the
MMFs within AR 11579) of vi ≈ 164 m s−1, Be ≈ 192 G,
−1, F ≈ 1.1 × 1015
−3, v ≈ 7.5 km s
Bi ≈ 351 G, n ≈ 1015 cm
−1, and Hjet ≈ 406 km (again for an estimated ﬁeld
g hr
strength of 200 G). Input values of R = 2.4 × 1015 Mx s−1
and l = 2.5 × 108 cm corresponding to Can. Event 2 re-

turn outputs of vi ≈ 210 m s
n ≈ 1.6 × 1016 cm−3, v ≈ 7.8 km s−1, F ≈ 1.3 × 1015 g
−1, and Hjet ≈ 599 km. Both the up-ﬂow velocities and
hr
jet heights are closer to those observed within EBs by both
Watanabe et al. (2011) and Nelson et al. (2015). Can. Event
−1, Be ≈ 231 G,
3 returns similar values of vi ≈ 179 m s
−1, F ≈ 1.0×1015
−3, v ≈ 7.6 km s
Bi ≈ 387 G, n ≈ 1.216 cm
g hr−1, and Hjet ≈ 451 km. Interestingly, the potential en-
ergies contained within these events are an order of 2 larger
than those predicted for MMFs 1 and 2 from AR 11579 at
around 2.5 × 1024 ergs. If this quantity is converted away
from magnetic energy over the course of one second and
then re-supplied by the surrounding bi-pole, these cancella-
tion rates would be capable of contributing enough radia-
tive energy to account for EBs with Emax ≈ 1.2 × 1027 ergs
(according to the estimates suggested by Georgoulis et al.

The Hα intensity increases co-spatial to the MMFs had
several typical properties of EBs, including emissions in ex-
cess of 150 % of the background intensity in the wings
of the Hα line proﬁle, areas close to 1
, and lifetimes
on the order of minutes (see, for example, Georgoulis et al.
2002, Watanabe et al. 2011). The SDO/AIA UV channels,
though, displayed no evidence of localised brightening in
conjuction with the Hα wing intensities potentially hint-
ing that these events are magnetic concentrations and not
EBs. Interestingly, the peaks of intensity for the Hα fea-
tures co-spatial to MMF 1 and MMF 2 were co-temporal
to the greatest measured cancellation. Fig. 2 plots repre-
sentative frames of the magnetic and spectral data during
the Hα event (top three frames) and the evolution of the
magnetic ﬁeld strength through time (bottom frame). De-
termining whether the increased cancellation rate at that
time contributed to the formation of the increased intensity
within this localised region or not is beyond the capabilities
of this dataset and would require a larger statistical sample
of MMFs inferred from magnetic data collected by a higher-
resolution instrument (when compared to SDO/HMI) such
as the SST/CRISP. Future work should aim to complete
such a study. It is possible that the Hα intensity increases
co-spatial to the MMFs presented here are similar to the
events analysed by Nindos & Zirin (1998); however, our re-
sults are inconclusive as to whether these features are indeed
EBs or the more benign magnetic concentrations.

In addition to these MMFs, three cancellation fea-
tures within AR 11765 (previously researched by Hong et al.
2014) and six from AR 11850 (including the four IRIS hot
explosions discussed by Peter et al. 2014) were analysed.
Seven of these bi-poles were, at some point during their life-
times, co-spatial to UV burst-like behaviour. In Fig 3, the
evolution of one bi-pole from within AR 11765 was plotted
through time depicting the spatial relationship between the
cancellation and the UV burst. In addition to this, eight
of the bi-poles displayed measureable cancellation rates of

ence in the top rows of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5), with the ninth

event cancelling at a rate of 5 × 1014 Mx s
events co-spatial to bursts, it was found that the periods
of increased UV intensity in the SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A and
1700 ˚A channels were co-temporal to sustained cancellation
(as plotted in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). The morphology of these
bursts was similar to UV intensity enhancements measured
by Vissers et al. (2015) co-spatial to both EBs and FAFs po-
tentially hinting at the formation of the phenomena studied
here. Which category these events could possibly fall into is
currently unknown (without co-temporal Hα data). No dis-
cernible properties (e.g., cancellation rates) were found to
diﬀerentiate or explain the two non-burst related cancella-
tion features within these datasets, however, it is known that
an IRIS hot explosion occurred co-spatial to one of these bi-
poles (Peter et al. 2014). It is possible that this event cor-
responds to a subset of IRIS bursts with no photospheric
component.

The measured properties of all eleven cancellation fea-
tures were then applied to the magnetic reconnection model
of Litvinenko (1999) and Litvinenko et al. (2007). Specif-
ically of interest were the upward ﬂow velocity, the max-
imum jet height, and the energy estimates at the site of
the hypothesised reconnection which can be directly com-
pared to the measurements obtained at the solar limb (by,
for example, Nelson et al. 2015). Assuming an iso-thermal
reconnection site, all features analysed here returned esti-
−1,
mated up-ﬂow velocities of between 5 km s
which are within one standard deviation of the mean up-
ward ﬂow velocity found in Nelson et al. (2015). The max-
imum jet heights (assuming a magnetic ﬁeld of around 200
G) for events with cancellation rates over 1015 Mx s−1 were
also similar to the measured heights within the literature
on EBs. The maximum energies contained within the mag-
netic ﬁeld are comparable to the radiative energies measured
within EBs at approximately 1.2×1027 ergs (as has been dis-
cussed by Georgoulis et al. 2002), although they are lower
than those suggested for IRIS hot explosions (Peter et al.
2014).

−1 and 8 km s

If iso-thermal reconnection is not assumed, the up-ﬂow
velocity increases. Speciﬁcally, enhancements in tempera-
ture corresponding to those estimated by semi-empirical
modelling of EBs (see, for example, Kitai 1983, Fang et al.
2006) appear to improve the ﬁt of this model to ob-
served measurements of upward ﬂow speed (such as
Watanabe et al. 2011, Nelson et al. 2015); however, this
model does not explain the larger heating within EBs and
IRIS hot explosions recently reported by both Peter et al.
(2014) and Vissers et al. (2015). How such heating would
occur is still unknown. It would be of interest to conduct a
similar study as presented here with a wider variety of data
including both EBs observed co-spatial to spectra sampled
by the IRIS instrument and also co-spatial to surges. Such
research should allow for an accurate estimation of the can-
cellation rate co-spatial to both of these features, potentially
allowing further inferences to be made about the tempera-
ture structures of these events.

The apparently sporadic relationship between UV
bursts, surges, and cancellation features is both confus-
ing and intriguing. Within the literature, numerous authors
have discussed the potential relationship between EBs and

surges (see, e.g., Rust 1968, Roy 1973, Madjarska et al.
2009); however, various datasets have also been analysed
showing no links between these features (e.g., Vissers et al.
2013, Nelson et al. 2015). Whether speciﬁc conditions must
be achieved within a multi-stage process for an UV burst
to drive a surge or whether these events are unrelated other
than by an occasional co-spatial occurrence is still to be un-
derstood. Platov et al. (1973) suggested that an increase in
the strength of a bi-polar region (up to a factor of 25) would
be required within 5 minutes in order for a surge to form.
The eleven bi-poles analysed here do not show such changes,
nor a link to surge events. The cancellation rates (Roy 1973)
and mass ﬂuxes (Bong et al. 2014) measured here, though,
are similar to those potentially required for surge formation.
It is possible that only a subset of UV bursts which corre-
spond to higher cancellation rates are linked to surges. This
relationship should be tested in future work.
