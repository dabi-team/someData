Abstract

The future opportunities for high-density QCD studies with ion and proton beams at the LHC are pre-
sented. Four major scientiﬁc goals are identiﬁed: the characterisation of the macroscopic long wave-
length Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP) properties with unprecedented precision, the investigation of the
microscopic parton dynamics underlying QGP properties, the development of a uniﬁed picture of parti-
cle production and QCD dynamics from small (pp) to large (nucleus–nucleus) systems, the exploration
of parton densities in nuclei in a broad (x, Q2) kinematic range and the search for the possible onset
of parton saturation. In order to address these scientiﬁc goals, high-luminosity Pb–Pb and p–Pb pro-
grammes are considered as priorities for Runs 3 and 4, complemented by high-multiplicity studies in pp
collisions and a short run with oxygen ions. High-luminosity runs with intermediate-mass nuclei, for
example Ar or Kr, are considered as an appealing case for extending the heavy-ion programme at the
LHC beyond Run 4. The potential of the High-Energy LHC to probe QCD matter with newly-available
observables, at twice larger center-of-mass energies than the LHC, is investigated.

Introduction

Experiments with heavy-ion collisions at the LHC create and diagnose strongly-interacting matter under
the most extreme conditions of high density and temperature accessible in the laboratory. Under these
conditions, QCD calculations on the lattice predict that matter undergoes a phase transition to a Quark–
Gluon Plasma (QGP) in which colour charges are deconﬁned and chiral symmetry is restored. Aside of
its intrinsic interest, this line of research is central to our understanding of the Early Universe and the
evolution of ultra-dense stars. In practice, the main focus of experimentation with nuclear beams at the
LHC is on learning how collective phenomena and macroscopic properties, involving many degrees of
freedom, emerge under extreme conditions from the microscopic laws of strong-interaction physics. In
doing so, proton–nucleus (p–A) and nucleus–nucleus (A–A) collision experiments at the LHC aim at ap-
plying and extending the Standard Model of particle physics to matter properties that govern dynamically
evolving systems of ﬁnite size.

Recent experiments with nuclear beams at collider energies have identiﬁed opportunities to further
strengthen the connection between the rich phenomenology of ultra-dense matter, and its understanding
in terms of the fundamental laws of strong-interaction physics. Two broad classes of phenomena may be
highlighted in this context.

First, the observation of ﬂow-like phenomena in essentially all measured soft particle spectra and
particle correlations lends strong support to understanding bulk properties of heavy-ion collisions in
terms of viscous ﬂuid dynamics. The ﬂuid-dynamic evolution is solely based on combining conservation
laws with thermodynamic transport theories that are calculable from ﬁrst principles in quantum ﬁeld
theory. Hence, this provides an experimentally accessible inroad to constraining QCD matter proper-
ties via soft ﬂow, correlation and ﬂuctuation measurements. As further explained in this document, this
motivates future improved measurements of ﬂow and transport phenomena, including in particular mea-
surements of soft heavy ﬂavour and electromagnetic radiation. It also motivates improved experimental
control over the system-size dependence of ﬂow phenomena to better constrain under which conditions
and in which kinematic regime ultra-relativistic p–A and A–A collisions show ﬂuid dynamic behaviour
and where this picture fails.

Second, the observation of quantitatively-large quenching phenomena in essentially all measured
hard hadronic observables in A–A collisions has established the feasibility of testing the produced QCD
matter with a broad set of probes whose production rates are controlled with good precision with pp ref-
erence measurements and perturbative QCD calculations. Hard quarks and gluons are known to interact
with the medium and they thus probe medium properties. As detailed in this document, important physics
opportunities are related to analysing hard probes in p–A and A–A collisions with the greater precision
and kinematic reach accessible in future LHC runs. For instance, the identiﬁcation of (Rutherford-type)
large-angle jet-medium scattering could constrain the quasi-particle nature of the ﬂuid-like medium. This
is of central importance since it critically tests the working hypothesis that the matter produced in A–A
collisions is a ﬂuid with a ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density η/s close to the theoretical min-
imum value. Such a ﬂuid would be void of quasi-particles, while QCD is deﬁnitive in predicting that a
microscope with sufﬁciently high resolution will reveal partonic (quasi-)particle structure. Identifying
the scale at which inner structure (such as quasi-particles and related non-vanishing mean free paths)
arises would provide a microscopic understanding of how ﬂuid-like behaviour arises in nucleus–nucleus
collisions. Therefore, probing the inner workings of the QGP by resolving its properties at shorter and
shorter length scales is one of the main motivations for future experimentation with hard probes. Also
at intermediate transverse momentum, this document identiﬁes important questions that will be acces-
sible experimentally. For instance, more differential studies of quarkonium bound-state dissociation as
a function of transverse momentum, rapidity and system size are expected to yield further insights into
the mechanisms of colour deconﬁnement and recombination. Moreover, there is the general question of
how ﬂuid-like phenomena at low momentum scales transition to quenching phenomena at intermediate
and high momentum scales.

Capitalizing on previous discoveries at RHIC, the LHC experimental programme with Pb–Pb and
p–Pb collisions has signiﬁcantly advanced the state of the art in both the soft- and the hard-physics sec-
tor. In the soft-physics sector, differential measurements at the LHC have in particular allowed for precise
pT, particle species and rapidity-dependent measurements of all higher ﬂow harmonics vn, their mode–
mode couplings and the resulting reaction-plane correlations. This ﬂow systematics extends to charmed
ﬂavoured hadrons and possibly even to beauty ones. It is at the basis of constraining QCD transport
properties today. In the hard-physics sector, the wider kinematic reach of LHC has given qualitatively
novel access to quarkonium suppression and jet-quenching phenomenology, including precision mea-
surements of bottomonium, novel observations of charmonium enhancement, and a rich phenomenology
of calorimetrically deﬁned jets and jet substructure in nuclear collisions.

LHC experiments have also led to surprises that pose signiﬁcant novel challenges for the un-
derstanding of p–A and A–A collisions. Most notable in this context is the discovery that ﬂow-like
phenomena are not limited to nucleus–nucleus collisions but they persist with signiﬁcant magnitude in
p–A collisions and in high-multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC and some of their signatures have been
observed even in minimum-bias pp collisions. However, pp collisions are typically expected to show
vanishingly small re-interaction rates between produced ﬁnal-state particles. In contrast, the perfect-ﬂuid
paradigm, that underlies the successful phenomenology of ﬂow-like phenomena in nucleus–nucleus col-
lisions implicitly, assumes that re-interaction rates are so large that even the notions of quasi-particle
and mean-free path become meaningless. Does the persistence of ﬂow-like phenomena in p–A and pp
collisions indicate, in contrast to previous belief, that the perfect-ﬂuid paradigm applies to these smaller
collision systems? Or, if the prefect-ﬂuid paradigm is not applicable to pp and p–A collisions, is it con-
ceivable that signiﬁcant corrections to a ﬂuid-dynamic picture of vanishing mean free path persist also in
the larger A–A collision systems? The LHC discoveries in pp and p–A collisions that give rise to these
questions provide arguably the strongest motivation for a future programme of detailed experimentation
that aims at constraining microscopic structures and length-scales in the produced QGP matter and that
is expected to clarify in this way the microscopic mechanisms underlying the apparent ﬂuid-dynamic
behaviour of pp, p–A and A–A collisions.

Historically, experimental heavy-ion programmes have always addressed a very diverse set of phe-
nomenological opportunities. Some of the proposed experimental measurements have always reached
out to other areas of science and could be clearly related to fundamental open question such as the origin
of mass in the Universe, QCD deconﬁnement, or the determination of thermodynamic transport prop-
erties (that led in the past to unforeseen connections between string theory and the thermodynamics of
quantum ﬁeld theories). Other parts of the experimental programme were originally not related to a
working hypothesis based on an open fundamental question, but they sometimes revealed themselves a
posteriori as elements of crucial insight. This can be said for instance about the LHC p–A programme,
that was not part of the original LHC design, that was ﬁrst conceived mainly as a set of benchmark mea-
surements for establishing the cold nuclear matter baseline for interpretation of heavy-ion data, and that
has resulted in one of the most surprising discoveries made in the LHC nuclear-beams programme. We
therefore emphasize that heavy-ion physics at the LHC, in the future as well as in the past, is likely to
have multiple ways of reaching out and contributing to physics at large. At the time of writing this report,
questions about the origin of collectivity in small pp and p–A collision systems, and their implications
for the interpretation of collective phenomena observed in A–A collisions, are arguably identiﬁed as the
most pressing conceptual issue in the scientiﬁc debate. As outlined so far, they are clearly related to
further experimentation with soft processes, and to research on the internal structure of QGP matter uti-
lizing hard processes. However, future experimentation at the LHC is not limited to this set of questions.
From improved constraints on nuclear parton distribution functions that may inform us about the physics
reach of future electron–ion facilities, to improved measurements of anti-nuclei, to ultra-peripheral colli-
sions of electromagnetic Weizsäcker-Williams photons at unprecedented ﬁeld strength, to the search for
qualitatively novel signatures of ultra-strong QED magnetic ﬁelds, the LHC nuclear beams programme

7

can provide new insight in a much broader range of subject areas.

As detailed in this report, the HL/HE-LHC physics working group 5 has identiﬁed future physics
opportunities for high-density QCD with ions and proton beams that can be grouped broadly into the
following four goals that are coming now within experimental reach:

1. Characterizing the macroscopic long-wavelength QGP properties with unprecedented precision.

2. Accessing the microscopic parton dynamics underlying QGP properties.

3. Developing a uniﬁed picture of particle production from small (pp) to larger (p–A and A–A)

systems.

4. Probing parton densities in nuclei in a broad (x, Q2) kinematic range and searching for the possi-

ble onset of parton saturation.

In the following, we summarize how the four general goals are addressed by the measurements
discussed in this report. As the density and temperature attained in hadronic collisions changes mildly but
distinctly with the centre-of-mass energy, the physics opportunities listed below can be further enhanced
by a combined interpretation of future measurements at the LHC and at RHIC. In particular, new or
upgraded experiments at RHIC aim at providing measurements of highly-improved quality and precision
in the sectors of hard probes (jets and jet correlations, heavy ﬂavour, quarkonia) and electromagnetic
observables.

1.1 Macroscopic QGP properties

At sufﬁciently long wavelength, essentially all forms of matter can be described by ﬂuid dynamics.
The observation of ﬂow-like behaviour in nucleus–nucleus collisions and in smaller collision systems
demonstrates that this universal long-wavelength limit of hot and dense QCD matter can be accessed
experimentally at the LHC. This provides an experimental inroad to fundamental questions about QCD
thermodynamics and hydrodynamics since i) the QGP properties entering a ﬂuid dynamic description
are calculable from ﬁrst principles in quantum ﬁeld theory, and ii) hydrodynamic long wavelength prop-
erties depend on the effective physical degrees of freedom in the plasma and they are thus sensitive to
the microscopic dynamics that governs their interactions. The following properties of the QCD matter
produced in TeV-scale collisions are accessible via future measurements at the LHC

1. Temperature

Within the programme of determining the QCD equation of state, QCD lattice simulations at ﬁnite
temperature have established since long a precise relation between the QCD energy density and
pressure that determine the ﬂuid dynamic expansion, and the temperature of QCD matter. While
energy density and pressure can be constrained experimentally by many measurements, an inde-
pendent determination of temperature is of great value for testing the idea of local equilibration in
heavy-ion collisions or for establishing deviations thereof. Future LHC experiments will constrain
the temperature and its time evolution with unprecedented precision, in particular via thermal ra-
diation of real and virtual (dileptons) photons (Chapter 8).

2. QCD phase transition at µB (cid:39)

0

Collisions at the LHC realize systems of close-to-zero baryo-chemical potential. QCD calcula-
tions on the lattice predict in this regime a smooth cross-over transition from a hot partonic plasma
to a cold hadron gas. Fluctuation measures of conserved charges are sensitive to the characteris-
tics of the phase transition. In future LHC experiments, they are accessible with unprecedented
precision and completeness (Chapter 3). Future measurements of low-mass dileptons will also be,
for the ﬁrst time at the TeV-scale, sensitive to in-medium modiﬁcations of the ρ-spectral function

8

(Chapter 8). This provides unique access to the transition between phases with restored and broken
chiral symmetry that is predicted by lattice QCD.

3. Viscosity and further QCD transport coefﬁcients

Existing ﬂow measurements provide tight upper bounds on the value of η/s and they have been a
cornerstone in supporting the perfect-ﬂuid paradigm. In the future, measuring higher-order cross-
correlations of ﬂow coefﬁcients will signiﬁcantly extend this line of research. In addition, we note
that the value of η/s can be related to the existence and size of the mean free path (isotropization
length scale), which in turn results from the existence of (quasi-)particle-like excitations in the
produced matter. This motivates increasing the precision on η/s with the aim of establishing
the tightest lower bound on this quantity (Chapter 4), and it motivates detailed studies of ﬂow in
smaller systems with the idea of identifying the scale at which the system size becomes comparable
to the mean free path (Chapter 9). Also, measurements of soft dileptons will give access to the
electric conductivity of the strongly interacting medium (Chapter 8), and ﬂow and correlation
measurements may help to constrain the bulk viscous corrections (Chapter 4).

4. Heavy-quark transport coefﬁcients

Heavy quarks provide unique tools for testing collective phenomena in nuclear collisions. As they
are produced in initial hard-scattering processes and ﬂavour is conserved throughout the collective
dynamical evolution, they are the best experimental proxy to the idea of putting coloured test
charges of well-deﬁned mass into the medium and testing how they participate in the evolution.
Of particular interest are precision measurements of transverse-momentum anisotropies vn and
nuclear-modiﬁcation factors of open heavy-ﬂavoured mesons that are known to constrain e.g. the
heavy-quark diffusion coefﬁcient 2πT Ds and its dependence on the temperature T , that can be
compared to ﬁrst-principle calculations of QCD on the lattice (Chapter 5).

5. Searching for transport phenomena related to the presence of strong electrodynamic ﬁelds.

Heavy-ion collisions produce the largest electromagnetic ﬁeld of any system accessible to labora-
tory experiments. The ﬁeld is largest in the early phase of the collision, thus the early-produced
heavy quarks are expected to be the most sensitive to its strength (Chapter 5). As the maximal
ﬁeld strengths are estimated to be of the order of the pion mass (e B2
π), effects are also
likely to be present for light-ﬂavour charged hadrons (Chapter 4). Other measurements of interest
include transport coefﬁcients such as the electric conductivity with which the plasma responds to
an electromagnetic ﬁeld, and that are calculable within QCD. In addition, as a consequence of
the chiral anomaly, QCD coupled to QED gives rise to anomalous hydrodynamics that displays
various qualitatively novel phenomena, including for instance a component of the electromagnetic
currents that ﬂows parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. The existence of these anomalous phenomena
follows from ﬁrst principles in ﬁeld theory and thermodynamics, but the size of potential experi-
mental signatures is model-dependent. Beyond determining conventional QED transport phenom-
ena, LHC allows to search with increased precision for these intriguing signatures of anomalous
ﬂuid dynamics (Chapter 4).

1.2 Accessing the inner workings of hot QCD matter

Previous experiments at the LHC and at lower centre-of-mass energy have established that the QCD mat-
ter produced in nucleus–nucleus collisions is subject to strong collective evolution. However, the nature
of the effective constituents of that matter, and its characteristic inner length scales (such as screening
lengths or mean scattering times, if any) are not yet understood. The scale dependence of QCD implies
that one must be able to resolve partonic constituents of hot QCD matter at sufﬁciently high resolution
scale. This motivates the use of high-momentum transfer processes (hard probes) to study the inner

9

workings of hot QCD matter. In addition, the current status of phenomenological modelling does not ex-
clude the existence of a sizeable mean free path of hot QCD matter (which is assumed in transport model
simulations of heavy-ion collisions, but which is not assumed in almost perfect ﬂuid dynamic models).
This motivates to learn about the inner workings at hot QCD matter also from particle production at
intermediate transverse momentum (such as heavy quark transport at intermediate and low pT). Here,
we highlight the following opportunities for further experimentation.

1. Constraining with jet quenching the colour ﬁeld strength of the medium

In general, the fragments of jets produced in nucleus–nucleus collisions are medium-modiﬁed due
to interactions with the hot QCD matter. These jet quenching effects depend on the inner struc-
ture of that matter. In particular, the average medium-induced colour ﬁeld strength experienced
by the escaping jet can be quantiﬁed e.g. with the quenching parameter ˆq, which measures the
average exchanged transverse momentum squared per unit path length. Experiments at the LHC
will provide improved constraints on this ﬁeld strength measurement (Chapter 6). Qualitatively
novel opportunities for testing the time evolution of the medium opacity to hard partons could
arise if boosted tops could be studied in nuclear matter. A run at the LHC with lighter (than Pb)
nuclei, like e.g. 40Ar, would provide sufﬁcient luminosity to this end, as well as largely enhanced
kinematic and statistics reach for γ–jet and Z–jet recoil measurements (Chapter 11.1). The oppor-
tunities for boosted top measurements in Pb–Pb and lighter nuclei collisions at the HE-LHC are
also discussed (Chapter 13).

2. Investigating the quasi-particle structure of QCD matter with jet and heavy-quark measurements
Hard quarks and gluons with different energies can be used to investigate the constituents of the
QCD matter at various resolution scales. On one side of the scale, high-energy quarks and gluons
(leading to high-energy jets) address the smallest spatial scale. While ˆq characterizes the effects
of jet–medium interactions in the coherent regime in which individual constituents in the medium
are not resolved, Z/γ–jet correlations and modern jet substructure measurements on the high-
statistics samples of future LHC Runs are expected to access a regime of Rutherford-type large
angle jet–medium scattering, in which the detection of recoil or of large angle deﬂections gives
insight into the microscopic structure of the produced matter (Chapter 6). On the other side of the
scale, the scattering of low-momentum heavy quarks, characterized using for example the diffusion
coefﬁcient, addresses the nature of the QCD constituents at long-wavelength scale (Chapter 5).

3. Testing colour screening with bottomonium production

The family of bottomonium bound states gives access to a set of well-deﬁned length scales that
are embedded in the hot and dense QCD matter. As a consequence, the dissociation of the various
bound states sensitively depends on the interplay of color screening and the coupling to the strongly
interacting medium through dissociation reactions. This opens a unique window on the in-medium
modiﬁcations of the fundamental QCD force that binds bottomonium. Increasingly-tight bound
states are expected to melt with increasing temperature, providing a laboratory for in-medium
spectroscopy. The increased precision of future measurements will allow to test for additional
physics mechanisms in the production of bottomonium, such as regeneration processes that may
affect the yield of Υ(2S) and Υ(3S). Also, the higher rates of future experiments will allow
one to cross-correlate measurements of bottomonium suppression with other manifestations of
collectivity, such as elliptic ﬂow (Chapter 7).

4. Testing colour screening and regeneration dynamics with charmonium production

In close similarity to bottomonium, the medium-modiﬁcation of charmonium bound states is sen-
sitive to colour screening and it is subject to the same QCD dissociation dynamics. However,
since charm quarks and anti-quarks are produced abundantly in nucleus–nucleus collisions at the
TeV scale, c and ¯c produced in different hard processes can form bound states. Indications of this

10

qualitatively novel bound-state formation process are accessible at low and intermediate transverse
momentum, and they motivate high-precision measurements of nuclear modiﬁcation factor RAA
and elliptic ﬂow v2. In addition, future open heavy-ﬂavour measurements reaching down to zero
pT with high precision will help to determine the total charm cross section which is a central input
for the precise quantiﬁcation of regeneration (Chapters 5 and 7).

5. Formation of hadrons and light nuclei from a dense partonic system

The question of how a collective partonic system of many degrees of freedom evolves into the
hadronic phase and produces colour singlet hadrons and light nuclei is essential for a complete
dynamical understanding of nucleus–nucleus collisions. Recent LHC measurements in proton–
proton and proton–nucleus collisions suggest that also in small-system hadronic collisions the
hadronization process may be modiﬁed with respect to elementary e+e− collisions. Future mea-
surements at the LHC will enable comparative and multi-differential studies of these modiﬁca-
tions with unprecedented precision, for both the heavy-ﬂavour sector (D+
s , charm and beauty
baryons, see Chapter 5) and for light nuclei and hyper-nuclei (Chapter 3). For open heavy ﬂavour,
these measurements are also crucial to disentangle the role of mass-dependent radial ﬂow and of
recombination, as well as to constrain the parameters of hadronization in the models that are used
to estimate QGP properties like the heavy-quark diffusion coefﬁcients. For light nuclei, precise
measurements of nuclei and hyper-nuclei with mass numbers 3 and 4 as well as possible observa-
tion of exotic baryonic states will address the question whether their production is dominated by
coalescence of protons, neutrons and Λ baryons or by statistical hadronization of a partonic sys-
tem. These measurements, in addition to that of high-momentum deuteron production, also have
important astrophysical implications (dense compact stars as well as dark matter searches in the
Cosmos).

1.3 Developing a uniﬁed picture of QCD collectivity across system size

As discussed at the beginning of this chapter, recent LHC discoveries of signatures of collectivity in
proton–nucleus and in proton–proton collisions question common beliefs. For the smallest collision sys-
tems, these measurements indicate that more physics effects are at work in multi-particle production
than traditionally assumed in the modelling of proton–proton collisions. For the larger collision sys-
tems (proton–nucleus and nucleus–nucleus collisions), they question whether the origin of signatures
of collectivity is solely (perfect) ﬂuid dynamical, given that these signatures persist in proton–proton
collisions. This raises important qualitative questions like: What is the smallest length scale on which
QCD displays ﬂuid-dynamic behaviour? Is there a non-vanishing characteristic mean free path for the
production of soft and intermediate pT hadrons, and if so, is it smaller or larger than the proton diam-
eter? What are the novel physics concepts with which underlying event simulations in proton–proton
collisions need to be supplemented (e.g. in multi-purpose event generators) to account for the totality of
observed phenomena? While some of these questions sound technical, it needs to be emphasized that
the size of dissipative properties of QCD matter, such as its shear viscosity, are quantitatively related to
the presence or absence of intrinsic length scales such as a mean free path. Any systematic experimental
variation of the system size therefore relates directly to a search for intrinsic length scales that determine
the dissipative properties of hot QCD matter. Within the present report, we identify in particular the fol-
lowing future opportunities for an improved understanding of the system-size dependence of collective
phenomena (Chapter 9):

1. Flow measurements in pp and p–A systems: Onset and higher-order correlations

While ﬂow signals have been established in smaller collision systems in recent years, their detailed
characterization lacks behind the state of the art achieved in nucleus–nucleus collisions. Future
measurements will allow for characterizing higher-order cumulants in largely non-ﬂow suppressed

11

multi-particle correlations, and test whether there is a system-size dependence in the characteristic
correlations between different ﬂow harmonics vn, or the characteristic reaction plane correlations.

2. Flow of heavy ﬂavour and quarkonium in smaller systems

Is there a minimal system size needed to transport heavy quarks within a common ﬂow ﬁeld? Given
that the local hard production of heavy ﬂavour is expected to be independent of any collective
direction, precision measurements of heavy-ﬂavour ﬂow in pp and p–A collisions will provide
decisive tests of heavy quark transport, thus experimentally addressing the question of how QCD
ﬂow ﬁeld build up efﬁciently and on short length and time scales.

3. Strangeness production as a function of system size

One of the recent surprising LHC discoveries that is not accounted for in traditional models of
minimum-bias pp collisions but that may be accounted for in a thermal picture is the smooth
increase of strangeness with event multiplicity across system size. We discuss in detail how fu-
ture measurement at the LHC, such as the study of strange D-mesons or baryons, can extend the
systematics underlying this observation (Chapters 5 and Section 9.7).

4. Searching for the onset/existence of energy-loss effects in small systems

All dynamical models of collectivity involve ﬁnal-state interactions. This implies the existence of
jet–medium ﬁnal-state interactions and, a fortiori, the existence of parton energy-loss effects. The
latter have not been identiﬁed experimentally, yet. In this report, we discuss novel opportunities to
test for their existence, including tests in future p–Pb collisions, as well as opportunities speciﬁc
to O–O collisions.

5. Searching for the onset/existence of thermal radiation in small systems

If the collectivity observed in smaller collision systems is due to ﬁnal-state isotropization and equi-
libration phenomena, it must be accompanied by thermal radiation. The search for the correspond-
ing conceptually clean electromagnetic signatures, such as thermal dilepton and photon production
in p–Pb collisions, is an important part in developing a uniﬁed picture of QCD collectivity. This
report discusses the experimental opportunities in light of experimental upgrades.

1.4 Nuclear parton densities and search for non-linear QCD evolution

Future experiments at the LHC offer a variety of opportunities for precision measurements with nuclear
beams. Here, we highlight three opportunities that are clearly related to the main physics challenges of
the heavy-ion programme (Chapter 10):

1. Precise determination of nuclear PDFs at high Q2

As high-momentum transfer processes have a short space-time scale, they are not affected by
the long-wavelength particle excitations of the QCD matter in nuclear collisions. This implies
that the primary production rates of hard processes in nucleus–nucleus collisions are determined
perturbatively, whereas their medium modiﬁcations arise from traversing a dense QCD matter of
considerable spatial extent and considerable colour-ﬁeld strength. For a dynamical understanding
of jet quenching, control over primary-production rates is indispensable and this necessitates the
knowledge of nuclear parton distribution functions. Global nPDF-ﬁts that reﬂect the current state
of the art of nuclear parton distributions could be improved at the LHC in the near future at high
Q2 and x
2 in particular with high-precision W, Z and dijets measurements in p–Pb
and Pb–Pb collisions (Sections 10.3 and 10.4). High-luminosity Ar–Ar collisions would enable
2–
for the ﬁrst time using top quarks to constrain nuclear PDFs at very high Q2 and large x
1 and would contribute to constraining experimentally the nuclear mass number A dependence
10−
of nuclear PDFs.

2. Constraining nuclear PDFs at low Q2

Drell-Yan and photon measurements (Section 10.3) in p–Pb collisions could provide signiﬁcantly
improved constraints on the nuclear parton distribution functions at low Q2 and low x
5–
3, where nuclear effects are larger. In addition, although so far global PDFs do not use mea-
10−
surements from ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC), it is thought that quarkonia and dijet production
in UPC can constrain nuclear PDFs in the future. This report identiﬁes opportunities for the corre-
sponding measurements (Section 10.2).

∼

3. Access to non-linear QCD evolution at small-x

s(x), these effects are dominant, and as the saturation scale Q2

The scale-dependence of parton distribution functions is known to obey linear QCD evolution
equations within a logarithmically wide range in Q2 and ln x. However, where partonic density in
the incoming hadronic wave function are not perturbatively small, qualitatively novel non-linear
density effects are expected to affect the QCD evolution. For Q2 smaller than a characteristic
saturation scale Q2
s(x) increases
with decreasing x, one expects on general grounds at sufﬁciently small ln x a qualitatively novel
saturation regime in which non-linear QCD evolution occurs at perturbatively large Q2. Future
measurements at LHC will provide novel test for these saturation effects with previously unex-
plored measurements (Section 10.3). The larger centre-of-mass energy of the HE-LHC would
extend the small-x coverage by an additional factor two. Measurements of relevance include in
p–Pb collisions dilepton and photon production at small-x and forward measurements of dihadron
and dijet correlations. The perspectives for such measurements are discussed in Chapter 13.

1.5 Physics performance studies by ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb

The performance results presented in this report were obtained by experimental groups within the four
Collaborations and they are described in more detail in these documents: ALICE [1–4], ATLAS [5–7],
CMS [8–12], LHCb [13]. Two types of results are included: simulation studies used full or fast simula-
tions of the detector setups for Run 3 and/or Run 4; projection studies are based on existing measurements
where their uncertainties have been reduced as expected with the future detectors and data samples. The
impact of the detector upgrades on the various observables is discussed in the corresponding chapters
and in more detail in the referenced documents by the Collaborations. The integrated luminosities used
for the physics studies are summarised in Chapter 12.

2.1 Heavy-ion performance of LHC in Runs 1 and 2

The 2018 Pb–Pb run of the LHC brought Run 2 to an end and launched the hardware upgrades to the
collider, and to the ALICE experiment, that should allow the full “HL-LHC” heavy-ion performance to
be delivered from 2021 onward. Beyond pp collisions, the 2004 LHC Design Report [14], speciﬁed only
1. Now, much of the upgraded
Pb–Pb collisions with a peak Pb–Pb luminosity of L = 1
performance is already in hand. Not only has that peak Pb–Pb luminosity goal been exceeded by a factor
of more than 6, but the p–Pb collision mode—an upgrade beyond the initial design whose feasibility was
widely doubted—has yielded similarly high luminosity in multiple operating conditions (see Ref. [15]
and references therein). Table 1 summarises the main parameters of the runs to date. Additionally, in
2017, the LHC has collided beams of Xe nuclei [16], providing many new results and demonstrating
the potential for colliding lighter species. The goal for 2018 was to complete the accumulation of an
1 to each of the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS experiments and this
integrated Pb–Pb luminosity of 1 nb−
was substantially exceeded. The LHCb experiment also received over 0.26 nb−

2.2 Pb–Pb luminosity in Run 3 and Run 4 (HL-LHC)

The High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) is an upgrade of the LHC to achieve instantaneous pp luminosi-
ties a factor of ﬁve larger than the LHC nominal value. Its operational phase is scheduled to start in LHC
Run 4, in the second half of the 2020s, for the pp physics programmes described in the other chapters
of this report. The HL-LHC project also includes hardware upgrades of the present LHC that will allow
the LHC to operate with potential peak Pb–Pb luminosities an order of magnitude larger than the nom-
inal [14]. These upgrades will be completed during Long Shutdown 2 and can already be exploited in
Run 3, starting in 2021. Upgrades to the heavy-ion injector chain, in the framework of the LHC Injectors
Upgrade project will increase the total stored intensity of heavy-ion beams and will also be completed
for Run 3. Finally, the ALICE experiment will be upgraded to accept higher peak luminosity.

The heavy-ion performance of the LHC will be similar in Run 3 and in Run 4. Therefore, the
two Runs are discussed together in this report in terms of their contribution to the HL-LHC heavy-ion
physics programme. To achieve the performance parameters given in the last column of Table 1 a detailed
speciﬁcation of the requirements on the beams at LHC injection has been given [18] and later updated in
1. The
Ref. [19]. In a typical one-month Pb–Pb run, this will yield an integrated luminosity of 3.1 nb−
necessary single-bunch intensities have already been attained but an implementation of slip-stacking in
the SPS will be required to obtain a basic bunch spacing of 50 ns and store over 1200 Pb bunches in
each LHC ring. The necessary upgrades of the SPS RF system will be implemented during LS2 and it is
planned to commission this new mode of operation in 2021.

2.2.1 Secondary beams from the IPs

Ultra-peripheral electromagnetic interactions of Pb nuclei lead to copious lepton-pair production. Most
of this is innocuous except for the (single) bound-free pair production (BFPP1):

cryostat (“missing dipole” in the DS) that does not contain a superconducting magnet coil and therefore
is less likely to quench. This technique was ﬁrst used in 2015.
It was almost fully proved in 2018
when the ATLAS and CMS Pb–Pb luminosities were sustained at values very close to the nominal
levelling values for Runs 3 and 4. Beam-loss monitor thresholds were set, based on the measured quench
level in 2015 and it was clear that there was sufﬁcient margin for still higher luminosity. In IP2, the
method of orbit bumps alone is not applicable with present optics and layout. It is therefore foreseen to
install an additional collimator in the connection cryostat on the outgoing beam on each side of IP2. In
combination with this, orbit bumps will then be deployed to steer the BFPP beams onto the collimators.
The installation will take place in LS2 in order to allow the HL-LHC design luminosity for ALICE
(corresponding to a hadronic event rate of 50 kHz) in subsequent runs.

2.2.2 Collimation and intensity limit

While the LHC stores unprecedented beam energies, superconducting magnets are needed to bend and
focus these beams, most of which are operated at 1.9 K. A loss of a tiny fraction of the beam is enough
to induce a magnet quench, and it is therefore vital to avoid any uncontrolled beam losses. To safely
intercept losses and provide protection of the magnets, the LHC uses a multi-stage collimation sys-
tem [24–27]. During the ﬁrst two runs of the LHC, this system has shown a very good performance with
proton beams [28–31] and ion beams [32, 33].

16

LHC collimation is much less efﬁcient with heavy-ion beams than with protons, since ions have a
high cross section for undergoing nuclear fragmentation inside the primary collimators [34]. The angular
offsets of the out-scattered fragments are frequently not large enough to reach the secondary collimators
in the straight collimation insertion (IR7). At the same time these fragments have a magnetic rigidity
different from the main beam, so that they risk being lost where the dispersion starts to rise in the ﬁrst
few dipoles of the DS. This was the most critical beam loss location during the Pb ion runs in Run 1
and Run 2, with a local cleaning inefﬁciency of about a factor 100 worse than for protons [32, 33].
Therefore, even though the total stored beam energy is about a factor 10 lower with Pb ions than with
protons, collimation of heavy ions is critical. Still, ion collimation has worked well in the LHC and
did not introduce operational bottlenecks so far. However, extrapolations of the losses in the DS from a
2015 experimental tests to Run 3 and HL-LHC show that, if nothing is done, the total stored Pb beam
energy is limited to around 10 MJ, if drops of the instantaneous beam lifetime down to 12 minutes are
assumed [35]. At the same time, it is foreseen to increase the stored Pb beam energy to about 24 MJ.
To alleviate this limitation and safely intercept the losses, it is planned to install additional collimators,
called TCLDs, in the dispersion suppressors [36–38]. On the other hand, the LHC was successfully
operated with Pb beams containing over 13.5 MJ each in 2018 thanks to good control of beam lifetimes.
In order to make space for the TCLDs, standard 8.3 T LHC dipoles will be replaced by an assembly
consisting of two shorter higher-ﬁeld 11 T dipoles with the TCLD in between [38]. The solution that
gives the best simulated Pb cleaning efﬁciency uses two TCLDs per side of IR7. However, this is
not possible within tight constraints of long shutdown 2 and the HL-LHC project, and the baseline is
therefore to install one TCLD per side. If this turns out to be a real limitation, it could be considered
at a later stage to install a second TCLD. As an alternative and complementary alleviation method, it is
under study whether crystal collimation could help in reducing the losses in the DS. In this collimation
scheme, bent crystals are used instead of the standard LHC primary collimators [39]. Incoming beam
particles follow the curvature of the crystal planes, the so-called channelling, and exit with a signiﬁcant
angular kick. They can then be efﬁciently steered onto an absorber. Nuclear interactions inside the the
channels of well-aligned crystals are signiﬁcantly suppressed. Initial experiments using an LHC test
installation [40] have shown very promising results with Xe and proton beams [41]. Channelling has
very recently also been observed with Pb beams in 2018 and potential improvements of the collimation
system are presently being assessed experimentally. Studies with Pb beams are not yet conclusive but it
is hoped that this will be further clariﬁed by analysis of data taken during the 2018 Pb ion run.

Collimation of lighter ion species has not yet been studied in detail, although some ﬁrst simulations
are presented in Ref. [32]. Results for Ar and Xe beams show that the amount of expected losses in the
DS is similar to Pb but the longitudinal loss distribution changes. The fractional change in magnetic
rigidity for every lost nucleon in the collimators is larger for light ions, and it is hence expected that out-
scattered fragments have larger effective energy deviations and are lost more upstream. It is thus likely
that the TCLD should help signiﬁcantly also for lighter ions, although comparative studies on intensity
limits for different ion species still remain to be done.

We present parameters for operation at the nominal LHC momentum ppc = 7 TeV extrapolating from
the experience of the last p–Pb run in 2016.

The injection and ramp of protons and lead ions with equal magnetic rigidity leads to moving long-
range beam-beam encounters in the four interaction regions of the LHC. These beam-beam encounters
were one of the reasons why the feasibility of p–Pb operation in the LHC was initially questioned. This
effect has been proven small in the LHC and calculations have this will remain true for the HL-LHC era
despite larger bunch numbers and higher proton bunch intensities. The dynamic range of the interlock
1010
strip-line BPMs, common for the lead and proton beam, limited the proton intensity to Nb < 5
protons per bunch during Run 1. Gating the stripline BPM read-out appropriately removed this constraint
1010 protons per
a few days before the end of the 2016 run. The higher proton intensity of Nb = 2.8
bunch resulted in increased luminosities at the IPs but also led to the substantial deposition of collision
debris from the Pb beam in the dispersion suppressors at ATLAS and CMS risking a beam dump [42].
The collision debris collimators (TCLs), which could have intercepted emerging fragments from the IPs,
were not commissioned at tighter settings for the 2016 p–Pb run. Appropriate TCL settings are expected
to neutralise these fragments and should allow for higher peak luminosities in the future.

×

A potential p–Pb run during Run 3 and beyond will greatly beneﬁt from the longitudinal slip
stacking in the SPS and the small β∗ = 0.5 m in three experiments. The proton intensity cannot be
pushed to values much larger than the maximum achieved in 2016 as bunches colliding in multiple IPs
109 charges per
and especially in ATLAS and CMS will approach the interlock BPM threshold of 2
bunch too quickly if the luminosities of ATLAS and CMS are not levelled. This would lead to an un-
desirable early beam dumps while ALICE is still levelled. In order to predict the potential performance
of a future p–Pb run, the expected Pb–Pb ﬁlling pattern [19] is used providing 1136 collisions in AT-
LAS/CMS, 1120 collisions in ALICE and 81 collisions in LHCb. This approximation is made since
the proton injection should be ﬂexible enough to reproduce most of the respective Pb pattern. This cal-

ity levelled in this scenario since the loss of integrated luminosity for ATLAS and CMS outweighs the
marginal gain for ALICE. A simulation of the beam evolution based on ordinary differential equations
including intra-beam scattering and radiation damping leads to a luminosity evolution in the different IPs
as displayed in Fig. 1.

emittances in the range of (cid:15)N = 1.3 µm have already been achieved.

in recent years (since the commissioning of the present ECR ion source and LEIR) yields a value of the
ﬁt parameter p = 1.9. Beam quality requirements for ﬁxed-target beams are, of course, less stringent
than for injection into the collider. Fitting to the ﬁrst commissioning of Xe beams for the LHC [16],
on the other hand, gives a much less optimistic p = 0.75. Although this was the only occasion where
any other species than Pb was delivered to the collider, only the simplest version of the injection scheme
was used and it is clear that, given time, signiﬁcantly higher intensities could be achieved. We consider
that 1.5
1.9 corresponds to a representative range of possibilities that could be realised in fully-
p
prepared future operation.

≤

≤

In addition, we make a number of simplifying assumptions to allow a simpliﬁed, yet meaningful,

comparison between species

– The geometric transverse beam emittances at the start of collisions will be equal to those of Pb
beams [18]. This is justiﬁed, at least at the level of the LHC, since the scaling of intra-beam
scattering with Nb, Z and A, given by the parameter fIBS/(m Hz) is generally smaller than for Pb
< 1.9. A similar scaling should hold in the injectors such as the SPS where intra-
as long as p
∼
beam scattering may also blow up the emittances. This ignores possible space-charge limits in
the injectors which should also be considered once the appropriate stripping schemes and charge
states have been deﬁned.

– Same ﬁlling scheme and number of bunches.
– No luminosity-levelling in any experiment.
– Fill length optimised for intensity evolution dominated by luminosity burn-off.
– Equal operational efﬁciency of 50%. Following conventional practice for HL-LHC, the integrated
luminosity for a 1-month run is estimated assuming back-to-back ideal ﬁlls of optimal length and
a turn-around time of 2.5 h between the end of one ﬁll and the resumption of “Stable Beams” for
collisions in the next. The operational efﬁciency factor is then applied as a way of taking into
account the time needed for commissioning, intensity ramp-up, faults and other non-availability of
LHC and injector systems.

The parameters are estimated using analytical approximations unlike the more elaborate simulations used
in Section 2.2. Together with the assumption that there is no luminosity levelling, these lead to a higher
estimate of integrated luminosity in a one-month run. Nevertheless they can be used as a guide to the
relative gain factors in integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity by changing from Pb to a lighter nucleus.

2.5 Short run for O–O and p–O

As discussed in Section 11.3, a short p–O collision run is of interest for cosmic-ray physics. If O beams
were available from the injectors, this could be combined with a short, low-luminosity, O–O run, which
would be of value for the main high-density QCD programme. Limiting the beams to low-intensities
would allow a rapid set-up in LHC on the successful model of the 2012 p–Pb run which was later re-
used in the 2017 Xe–Xe run [16]. Each of those runs took about 16 h of LHC operation time, including
set-up and physics data-taking but a combination O–O/p–O run could take a few days.

Because oxygen is used as the carrier gas in the CERN heavy-ion source, the idea has been mooted
that it may be possible to switch from Pb to 16O8+ beams for the LHC, and back, somewhat more rapidly
than other species. Commissioning of the O beam in the injectors for single-bunch injection into the LHC
would need to be scheduled, in parallel with pp operation, and use of the injectors for other programmes,
in the period preceding the O–O/p–O run. The possibilities are under study and include either inserting
the run at the end of one of the annual Pb–Pb runs or scheduling it earlier in the year in order to provide
time for the source to be switched back to Pb operation afterwards.

2.6 Heavy-ion performance of HE-LHC

Heavy-ion operation of HE-LHC awaits a fully detailed study. First results were presented in [44]. Since
the HE-LHC would occupy the same tunnel as the LHC, one can, for the moment, assume the same
injected beams as HL-LHC. Future possible upgrades to the injectors might improve this. The total
integrated luminosity obtainable per ﬁll, summed over all experiments, is bounded by the total intensity
divided by the burn-off cross-section and will therefore be similar to the HL-LHC. The same can be said
for time taken to inject a ﬁll. Only a modest increase in integrated luminosity, given by somewhat shorter
times spent in collision and, most likely, a reduction in the number of experiments, can be envisaged. For
purposes of this report, we estimate that the integrated luminosity obtained by each of two experiments
1. However, the BFPP power with Pb–Pb collisions will be
in a one-month run will be of order 6 nb−
very high and this could be a strong argument for running with somewhat lighter species. In that case,
one can expect the luminosity to scale similarly to HL-LHC in Sect. 2.4.

Introduction

The analysis of the data collected at the LHC during Run 1 and Run 2 has consolidated our understanding
of a standard model for the production of light-ﬂavour hadrons (containing u, d and s quarks) in heavy-ion
collisions: particle chemistry (described by integrated particle yields) is well described by the thermal-
statistical model [45, 46] and kinetic equilibrium (reﬂected in the pT-dependence of particle production)
is well described by a common radial expansion governed by hydrodynamics [47,48]. While the physics
of light-ﬂavour particles is often perceived as not statistics hungry, the unprecedented large integrated
luminosities expected in Run 3 and Run 4 at the LHC offer a unique physics potential. Despite contain-
ing only u, d and s valence quarks, light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei are very rarely produced because of their
composite nature and very large mass. Their study will enormously proﬁt from the signiﬁcant increase
in luminosity for heavy-ion collisions expected in the years 2021 until 2029. The same holds true for the
study of event-by-event ﬂuctuations of the produced particles, which is closely linked to the production
of light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei in the scenario of a common chemical freeze-out determining light-ﬂavour
hadrons and (hyper-)nuclei abundances. If, as indicated by the recent experimental ﬁndings [46], the
thermal-statistical approach is the correct model to describe (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei production, the chem-
ical freeze-out temperature is most precisely determined by measurements of light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei
as they are not subject to feed-down corrections from strong decays [45]. This is the same temperature
at which event-by-event ﬂuctuations of conserved quantities are compared to lattice QCD (lQCD). The
physics of light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei and exotic multi-quark states together with the related observables
that will become experimentally accessible in Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC Runs 3 and 4 are discussed
in Sec. 3.2. In Sec. 3.3, measurements of ﬂuctuations of particle production and conserved charges are
discussed as they give experimental access to fundamental properties of the QCD phase transition at µB
and allow for direct comparison with lQCD calculations.
In small collision systems (pp, p–Pb), measurements of light-ﬂavour hadrons provide fundamental input
to the study of particle production mechanisms and collectivity across systems, as discussed in Ch. 9.
At the same time, the physics programme with pp and p–Pb collisions in Runs 3 and 4 will open the
possibility for system-size dependent studies of (anti-)nuclei production and for precision measurements
of the hyperon-nucleon potentials. The physics case for these measurements in small colliding systems
is motivated in this chapter in Sec. 3.2.6, as well as the implications of the ﬁndings at the LHC for
astrophysics and searches for dark matter in space-based experiments.

3.2

(Anti-)(hyper-)nuclei production

3.2.1 Testing thermal production and nucleon coalescence models

The production of light (hyper-)nuclei and their anti-matter counterparts is modeled within the scenarios
In the thermal-statistical approach [45,
of thermal-statistical hadronisation and nucleon coalescence.

23

49], particles are produced from a ﬁreball in thermal equilibrium with temperatures of the order of
156 MeV that are near the temperature of the QCD phase transition boundary, as predicted
Tchem ≈
by lQCD calculations [50, 51]. The yields of the produced objects depend on the chemical freeze-out
temperature Tchem (when inelastic collisions cease) and the mass m of the object, and approximately
scale as dN /dy
m/Tchem). Thermal-statistical models have been successful in describing
light-ﬂavour particle production across a wide range of energies in nucleus-nucleus collisions [45, 46].
Due to their large mass, light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei are particularly sensitive to Tchem and since they are
not affected by feed-down from higher mass states [45], the measurement of their production constitutes
a precision test for the thermal model.

exp(

∝

−

In the coalescence scenario, composite objects are formed at kinetic freeze-out by coalescence of
nucleons that are close in conﬁguration and momentum space [52–57]. Calculations of the coalescence
probability based on a density matrix approach [57] require the knowledge of the nucleus wave function
and identify the volume of the particle source as the homogeneity volume that can be extracted via
Hanbury-Brown–Twiss interferometry [58]. The size of the (hyper-)nucleus is identiﬁed with the size
parameter of its wave-function, which is related to the (measurable) rms of the charge distribution by
simple relations [55, 59].

While there are several theory groups working on the calculation of the expected coalescence [57,
60–63] and thermal production rates [49,64,65], predictions reported in Fig. 2 rely on the study presented
in [59], which contrasts the two production scenarios. In order to distinguish them, a measurement of the
coalescence parameter for (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei that differ by mass, spin and size as a function of source
volume (or source radius) is proposed. The coalescence parameter BA is deﬁned as

model (black curves in top panels of Fig. 2), the coalescence parameter is determined analytically. The
thermal model predicts pT-independent particle yields at a given Tchem, therefore a Blast-Wave (BW)
model is used in [59] to describe the pT-dependence of (hyper-)nuclei and nucleon production. With
the pT spectra of (hyper-)nuclei and protons obtained in this way, Eq. 6 is used to extract BA (dashed
blue curve in top panels of Fig. 2). Similarly, the coalescence parameter is obtained experimentally from
Eq. 6 using the measured (hyper-)nucleus and proton pT distributions as input. It is considered that for
BW, little energy dependence of the ﬁt parameters is observed in Pb–Pb collisions from √sNN = 2.76 to
5.02 TeV. The thermal model yields only depend on temperature and no collision energy dependence of
the temperature is expected in the LHC energy range. The size of the source can be sampled by means
of multiplicity- and centrality-differential measurements.

The particle with the strongest sensitivity to the production mechanism appears to be the hyper-
triton (a pΛn bound state) with its large charge rms radius of about 10 fm, for which the coalescence
and the thermal model predictions differ by up to three orders of magnitude as a function of the source
radius. While the hypertriton seems to be largely suppressed with respect to 3He (pnn), the 4
ΛH (ppΛn)
is predicted to have only a slightly lower coalescence probability with respect to 4He (ppnn). Moreover,
for small R, i.e. in small systems as those formed in pp and p–Pb collisions, 3
ΛH is predicted by coa-
lescence to be suppressed by about a factor of 100 with respect to 3He. These considerations motivate
systematic multi-differential measurements of A = 3 and A = 4 nuclei and hyper-nuclei as a function of
multiplicity and from small (pp, p–Pb) to large systems (Pb–Pb) to test the validity of the coalescence
picture as opposed to thermal production.

ΛH, 4
The yields of (hyper-)nuclei (d, 3He, 4He, 3
ΛHe) and their anti-particles in Pb–Pb collisions
at the LHC in Runs 3 and 4 have been estimated for measurements with ALICE. The detectable yield
and signiﬁcance for (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei have been estimated for 0–10% central Pb–Pb collisions con-
sidering the acceptance and detection efﬁciency in the nominal magnetic ﬁeld of the ALICE detector
(B = 0.5 T). These projections are reported for anti-particles in Fig. 3 as a function of the minimum-bias
integrated luminosity. The detectable particle and anti-particle yields are equivalent in the considered pT
range. All projections have been extracted in the 2 < pT < 10 GeV/c range, where the lower limit is
given by the pT down to which nuclei with A
3 can be reconstructed without ambiguity in ALICE. In
a scenario in which ALICE will take data with a central-barrel low-ﬁeld conﬁguration (B = 0.2 T), it will
be possible to extend the low-pT limit for (anti-)nuclei identiﬁcation down to 1 GeV/c, increasing the
expected number of detectable light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei (by about 20% for 3He). In Fig. 3, the bands in-
dicate the uncertainty on the yield (signiﬁcance) associated with different model predictions: the central
line is obtained assuming statistical-thermal production with Tchem = 156 MeV [49], the upper line is the
yield (signiﬁcance) assuming thermal production at Tchem = 158 MeV, and the lower one using for the
yields the expectation from coalescence (see Sec. 3.2.1). The arrow represents the recorded luminosity
at the end of the LHC Run 2. It has to be noted that for this study, the geometry of the ALICE Inner
Tracking System (ITS) in Run 2 has been considered. The new geometry and acceptance of the upgraded
ITS system [3] are expected to increase the detection efﬁciency by up to 20%.

Elliptic ﬂow measurements for anti-nuclei provide a powerful independent
test of coalescence scenarios as already demonstrated with deuterons [71] and might provide an indirect
assessment of the neutron ﬂow comparing the 3He and 3H results. In addition, the large data sample
that will be collected for light anti-nuclei will lead to the ﬁrst precise measurements of the mass of light
anti-nuclei with A = 3, by means of the Time-Of-Flight detector [72]. This measurement will make it
possible to test Charge Symmetry Breaking (CSB) in the anti-nuclei sector due to the differences in the
up and down quark masses and due to electromagnetic effects [73]. The differences in A = 3 systems are
extensions of the neutron-proton difference. Although the mass difference for the lightest “mirror pair”
with A = 3 (i.e. 3H,3He), is well known (at the level of O(eV) [74]), no measurement has been performed
in the anti-matter sector and will be accessible with Lint = 10 nb−

1.

In the right panel of Fig. 3, the expected signiﬁcance of anti-hyper-nuclei measurements in central
Pb–Pb collisions is reported as a function of the minimum bias integrated luminosity. For each species,
the decay channels with the minimum number of charged particles in the ﬁnal state and with the highest
detection efﬁciency in ALICE have been considered for this study, as reported in the legend of Fig. 3.
The study of other decay channels, e.g. the three body decay of 3
ΛH that has larger theoretical branch-
ing ratio with respect to the 2-body decay [75], but lower detection efﬁciency in ALICE, will be also
carried out proﬁting from the large integrated luminosity. Considering the thermal model predictions
at Tchem = 156 MeV, the expected signiﬁcance of 3
1 is 100, 7 and 5,
respectively. The collected sample will enable very precise measurements of the production of 3
ΛH and

3.2.3 The hypertriton lifetime
The experimental measurement of the Λ separation energy of the 3
0.04
(syst.) MeV [76], led to the hypothesis that the lifetime of the hypertriton is equal to or only slightly
below the free Λ lifetime τ (Λ) = 263.2
0.2 ps [77]. Three different experimental techniques have been
used to tackle this question: photographic emulsion, He bubble chambers, and counter experiments. The
average for the emulsion experiments is 203+40
13 ps [78],
and for the combination of both visualizing techniques is 193+14
13 ps [78]. The most recent results, 181
+54
29 ps, have been obtained with the counter technique in heavy-ion collisions
39±
−
by the ALICE [79] and STAR [80] experiments, respectively. This technique is currently the one with the
highest precision (14-16%) and the weighted average of heavy-ion experiments results is 185+28
23 ps [78].
However, the few existing theoretical calculations point in the direction of the hypothesis mentioned at
the beginning of this section. The ﬁrst theoretical determination of τ (3
ΛH) (by Dalitz and Rayet, [81])
ranged from 239.3 to 255.5 ps. More recent calculations from Congleton [82] and Kamada [75] estimated
values of 232 ps and 256 ps, respectively. The deviation of the experimental results from the theoretical
calculations and the free Λ lifetime, by more than 2σ, is known as the “hypertriton lifetime puzzle”.

With the expected integrated Pb–Pb luminosity at the end of the LHC Run 4, the statistical uncer-
tainty on the lifetime will be reduced down to 1%. In parallel, a reduction of the systematic uncertainty
(
10% in the most recent ALICE measurements), will be achieved with the upgraded ALICE ITS that
∼
will allow for a reduction of the uncertainty due to tracking and material budget. To improve even fur-
ther down the control on the systematic uncertainty, a better understanding of the corrections for the
absorption in the material will be crucial.

3.2.4 Σ-hypernuclei

In addition to measurements of Λ-hypernuclei, also the search for Σ-hypernuclei is to be considered with
the luminosities forseen for the LHC Runs 3 and 4. Theory calculations for the ΣNN system suggest

Among Σ-hypernuclei, only the 4
Σ0He bound state has been observed so far, using the 4He(K−, π−)
reaction [84]. When the Σ0 hyperon is bound inside a nucleus, the electromagnetic decay is dominated
by the conversion reaction Σ0N
ΛN, thus the partial width of electromagnetic decay is expected to
be reduced substantially. However, for the I = 2 state the conversion reaction is not allowed and the
electromagnetic decay becomes prominent. Experimental searches for Σ-hypertriton bound states will
also proﬁt from the Pb–Pb data-taking programme of the LHC Runs 3 and 4 to exploit the strong decay

decays, are particularly suited for these studies.

The per-event yields of these states (dN /dy)th) predicted by quark- and hadron-coalescence mod-

els [60] and the statistical-thermal model [45] are reported in Tab. 6.

thermal production.

Measurements of f0(980) and N(1875) will be feasible in Runs 3 and 4 and will shed light on the
highly-debated nature of the states (hadrons or hadronic molecules). In particular, the N(1875) can be
considered a molecular bound state and at the same time the strange partner of the recently discovered
pentaquark Pc [90]. Because the structure of exotic states is related to the fundamental properties of
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), their observation can provide new insights on the properties of QCD
at ﬁnite temperature and density, for instance that tetraquark condensation may lead to a second chiral
phase transition [60]. Several possible states have been studied and predictions are available on the

look promising in terms of detection feasibility. Their detection and baryon-baryon correlations will be
useful for hyperon correlation studies, providing new insights into the baryon-baryon attractive potential
as well as upper limits on the formation of such bound states in central heavy-ion collisions.

Very recently, a study was reported on the production of exotic charmonia, speciﬁcally the possible
tetraquark state X(3872), in Pb-Pb and Kr-Kr collisions at LHC collision energies [91]. For X(3872)
production in Pb-Pb collisions the authors predict, using the statistical hadronization model for charm,
a transverse momentum distribution similar in shape to that for J/ψ mesons with a strong enhancement
at low transverse momenta and a production yield of about 1% relative to that for J/ψ. It would be
interesting and feasible to test this prediction in LHC Run 3 and especially Run 4.

Implications of anti-nuclei measurements for cosmic-ray physics and dark-matter searches

The HL-LHC physics program with pp and p–Pb collisions will allow for precision measurements of
anti-nuclei production and related observables that have implications for cosmic-ray physics and dark-
matter searches. Cosmic-ray (CR) anti-nuclei p, d, and 3He have long been considered as probes of new
physics, such as dark matter annihilation [92–103]. Detecting these particles is one of the main goals of
various CR experiments (e.g. AMS-02 [104, 105], GAPS [106, 107], BESS-Polar [108]).

The galaxy produces CR anti-nuclei as secondaries, due to collisions of CR protons and helium
with interstellar matter. Information from accelerator experiments is essential for the theoretical descrip-
tion of the background constituted by these secondary anti-nuclei. The ﬂux of secondary anti-nuclei can
be calculated with only minor sensitivity to the details of CR astrophysics. The point is to use secondary-
to-secondary ﬂux ratios, where astrophysical uncertainties largely cancel. Secondary p, d, and 3He are
all formed dominantly by the same set of reactions. Using this basic fact, an explicit prediction for the

Theoretical predictions of yields per event, (dN /dy)th, are given in three different scenarios: quark- and
hadron-coalescence [60], and thermal model [49]. Sraw represents the total detectable yield at the Pb–Pb

luminosity of 10 nb−

Implications of anti-nuclei measurements and hyperon-nucleon correlations for neutron star
physics

Although the neutron star crust is composed of neutrons, within the innermost core hyperons could be
present [118]. Whether or not this scenario holds true depends on the two- and three-body hyperon nu-
cleon interactions (YN and YNN) that are still only rather scarcely constrained experimentally.

3Note that the rigidity R = 100 GV refers to the CR experiment rest frame, which is boosted w.r.t.

the proton-proton
collision centre of mass frame. In the proton-proton collision centre of mass frame, the anti-nuclei are formed close to threshold.

30

At present the mass range for observed neutron stars is about (0.9 – 3.0)M(cid:74) within errors [119], where
M(cid:74) stands for the solar mass. The equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars is constrained by the mass-
radius relationship, in particular, the maximum mass (Mmax). An EoS with "conventional" (N+π) de-
grees of freedom provides Mmax invariably above 2M(cid:74) [120–122]. However, adding the Λ hyperon in
the hadronic basis softens the EoS and, as a consequence, signiﬁcantly reduces Mmax. The solution of
this so-called "hyperon puzzle" is non-trivial, and is presently the subject of very active research.

Thanks to the large yields of free hyperons and exotic (anti-)hyper-nuclei that can be produced in
collider experiments and the excellent particle identiﬁcation capabilities of the ALICE experiment, the
upcoming experimental campaigns in Runs 3 and 4 at the LHC offer a unique opportunity to quantita-
tively characterise hypermatter under controlled (laboratory) conditions and infer on the equation of state
of compact objects as neutron stars.

One of the crucial element to solve the “hyperon puzzle” is the determination of the ΛNN three-
body forces. Calculations show that with a parameterization of these forces compatible with the hyper-
nuclear binding energies, the admixture of Λ’s in neutron star matter gets strongly reduced such that the
pressure to support a 2M(cid:74) neutron star can be maintained [123]. The observation of neutron-rich Λ
hyper-nuclei like 4
ΛH etc. at colliders could be very promising for studying the effects of the three-body
ΛNN forces in dense strongly interacting matter since a precise knowledge of light neutron-rich hyper-
nuclei energy level structure could imply far-reaching consequences for dense strange stellar matter
properties.

→

→

Σ−+ p, Λ + n

Another promising way to contribute to the understanding of the hyperon puzzle is to pin down
the hyperon-nucleon two-body interaction for hyperons such as Σ− and Ξ−. These hyperons can also be
produced within neutron rich matter (n + n
Ξ−+ p) depending on their interaction
with the surrounding neutrons. Some models assume a repulsive pΣ interaction and postulate that Σ−
can appear in neutron rich matter only starting from baryon densities ρ
4ρ0 (where ρ0 is the density
of standard nuclear matter) [124]. For Ξ, no reliable experimental information about the interaction is
available. Recent studies [125] showed that the femtoscopy technique applied to pp and p–Pb collisions
at LHC energies are particularly suited to study the ﬁnal state interaction between nucleons and strange
baryons (e.g.: Λ–p) and between two strange baryons (e.g.: Λ–Λ). Indeed, small colliding systems such
as pp and p–Pb lead to hadron sources of rather small dimensions, of the order of 1 fm, in the range
where the strong interaction is mostly evident. Also, the production mechanism of hadrons in minimum
bias pp and p–Pb collisions is not affected by the intermediate creation of a QGP and its time-dependent
evolution as in Pb–Pb collisions at LHC energies. This allows for a more precise study of the hadron-
hadron interactions.

(cid:39)

Among the quantitative results obtained by ALICE in Run 2 at the LHC is the ﬁrst observation of
the attractive pΞ− interaction. Figure 4 shows the expected pΞ correlation for the Run 3 pp sample as a
. The projection is obtained on the basis of the current prediction
function of the relative momentum k
by the HAL-QCD lQCD group [126,127] that is in agreement with the Run 2 results. The clear deviation
from the Coulomb-only correlation function shows the effect of the strong attractive interaction and the
expected statistics will allow for a quantitative determination of the scattering parameters and the test of
different hadronic models [128, 129]. The investigation will also be extended to the Σ0 hyperon, since in
Run 3 and 4 we expect a total of 500,000 pΣ0 pairs to be used to study the femtoscopy correlation.

∗

In summary, massive neutron stars with M

2M(cid:74) are very intriguing recent observations in
∼
relativistic astrophysics. An improved account of the two-body YN interaction, the three-body ΛNN
forces, and the contribution of multi-strange hyperons in the EoS is crucially important for more realistic
description of compact astrophysical objects, in particular neutron and hybrid stars. The measurement
of hyper-nuclei and hyperon correlations with the HL-LHC project are suggested as a promising tool for
astrophysical applications.

3.3 Fluctuations of conserved charges

3.3.1 Physics introduction and observables

In the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter at zero net baryon density, the presence of a chiral
phase transition between hadronic matter and a QGP has been conjectured [130], and arguments have
been presented [131,132] in lQCD that the transition, for vanishing light quark masses, is of second order
and belongs to the O(4) universality class. Due to the small but ﬁnite physical quark masses, in lQCD a
rapid crossover is found [133–137] which, however, exhibits pseudo-critical features due to the smallness
of the u- and d-quark masses and the proximity of the crossover region to the O(4) line [131, 138].

In general, ﬂuctuations can be linked to critical behaviour associated with a phase transition, and
it has been pointed out that ﬂuctuations of conserved charges in heavy-ion collisions can provide an
experimental observable to test for critical behaviour in the phase diagram of strongly interacting mat-
ter [139–142]. These ﬂuctuations can be related to susceptibilities, speciﬁcally to the derivatives of the
pressure with respect to the chemical potentials corresponding to the conserved charges. Here, the rel-
evant ‘charges’ are baryon number B, strangeness S, and electrical charge Q, and the corresponding
chemical potentials are µB, µS, and µQ. The susceptibilities are deﬁned (see e.g. [142, 143]) in terms of
dimensionless normalized chemical potentials ˆµX ≡

The generalized susceptibilities can be computed in lQCD at vanishing chemical potential, exactly the
conditions probed by experiments at the LHC. Within the Grand Canonical Ensemble (GCE), these
generalized susceptibilities can be related to experimental measurements of the ﬂuctuations of particle
multiplicities, such as the net number of baryons. For instance, a measurement of higher moments or
cumulants of net baryon number in relativistic nuclear collisions can be directly related [144–149] to
theoretical predictions from lQCD or from more phenomenological models of the chiral phase transition
[150,151] to shed light on the possible critical behaviour near the QCD phase boundary. For a distribution

susceptibilities from [152].

In the O(4) universality class, a singular contribution to the pressure shows up for higher order
moments. More speciﬁcally, at vanishing chemical potential, all odd susceptibilities of the net baryon
number vanish. In addition, in the O(4) universality class, the second- and fourth-order susceptibilities
remain ﬁnite at the phase transition temperature at µB = 0 in the chiral limit, implying that only sixth-
and higher-order susceptibilities diverge [139, 141]. Thus, for physical quark masses and at µB = 0,
only higher order cumulants κn with n

Sensitivity to chiral criticality due to the vicinity of the O(4) line at µB = 0 is borne out in
phenomenological models as is shown in [141, 150], and in lQCD predictions [140, 152], by strong
deviations of χB

We note that a convenient baseline for the cumulants of multiplicity distributions and ﬂuctuations
of produced particles in relativistic nuclear collisions can be obtained in the framework of the hadron
resonance gas (HRG) [144, 152–155]. In this model, uncorrelated Poissonian ﬂuctuations of baryon and
anti-baryon multiplicities result in a Skellam distribution for the net baryon number, in which the higher
moments and cumulants can all be related to the ﬁrst moments in the following way [154, 156, 157]:

For zero net baryon number then all odd cumulants vanish and all even cumulants are identical.

Measuring such cumulants with precision poses a formidable experimental challenge due to the
requirement of very large data sets (> 109 events of a particular event or centrality class) with superb
control of systematic uncertainties. As a ﬁrst physics case to consider along this line, the impact of
measuring the distribution of net protons as a proxy for net baryons needs to be studied further. We
note that, at LHC energy and low transverse momentum, particle production near mid-rapidity takes

absent. As a consequence, the production yields of protons and neutrons should be very close. For light
nuclei this isospin symmetry has been checked experimentally, albeit with signiﬁcant uncertainties. In
addition, non-critical contributions to the cumulants from volume ﬂuctuations and global baryon number
conservation [145, 157, 158] need to be evaluated and the data corrected accordingly. Furthermore, in
particular for comparison to lQCD predictions, care needs to be taken to keep experimental cuts such as
in pT to a minimum insofar as such cuts cannot be introduced in lQCD [159, 160].

Two-particle correlations with net baryons can also be used to explore transport properties of the
hydrodynamic evolution. The baryon diffusion constant D is a fundamental transport property of the
quark-gluon plasma, similar to shear viscosity η or bulk viscosity ζ. It characterizes the mobility of
0. A two-particle

diffusion coefﬁcient D. As µB ∼

in the Pb–Pb integrated luminosity foreseen for Runs 3 and 4.

3.3.2 State of the art experimental measurements and present limitations

Net proton ﬂuctuations measured by the ALICE experiment and in the STAR beam energy scan pro-
gram provide interesting and stimulating results. The measurements at STAR [162] complement the
corresponding measurements from ALICE, which will make it possible to pin down the global struc-
ture of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter in a wide range of temperatures and net-baryon
densities. However, before drawing ﬁrm conclusions by confronting theoretical calculations with data,
non-dynamical contributions stemming from unavoidable ﬂuctuations of participant nucleons and overall
baryon number conservation have to be subtracted from the experimental measurements. Both of these
non-dynamical contributions, which exist neither in lQCD nor in the HRG model, lead to deviations
from the baseline as deﬁned in Eq. 15. Indeed, the acceptance dependence of the second-order cumulants
of net-protons measured by ALICE [163] exhibits deviations from the non-critical (Skellam) baseline.
However, these deviations were explained by global baryon number conservation [157, 158, 163], which,
in accordance with the experimental ﬁndings, decreases the amount of ﬂuctuations with the increasing
acceptance. This is the ﬁrst experimental veriﬁcation of the lQCD predictions for the second-order cu-
mulants of net-baryon distributions. This also serves as a strong support of the HRG model, in that
experimental measurements of the second cumulants of net-protons do not show any evidence of crit-
icality and actually coincide with the second cumulants of the Skellam distribution. In order to probe
critical phenomena, higher cumulants beyond the second order have to be addressed.

As mentioned in the previous section, even at vanishing net-baryon densities, lQCD and other
theoretical calculations such as Polyakov-loop extended Quark- Meson model (PQM) [150] predict crit-
ical ﬂuctuations encoded in the deviations of net-baryon κ4/κ2 and κ6/κ2 from unity. Moreover, at
the pseudo critical temperature of about 156 MeV the magnitudes of κ4/κ2 and κ6/κ2 are predicted in
Ref. [150] to be 0.5 and -0.39, respectively. Similar values of κ6/κ2 are quoted in different lQCD cal-
culations as presented in Fig 5. These numbers, shown in Fig. 6, do not take into account experimental
artefacts such as global net-baryon number conservation and unavoidable ﬂuctuations of participating
nucleons from event to event. Also shown are the values of of κ4/κ2 and κ6/κ2 after accounting for
these non-dynamical effects using the procedure in Refs. [157, 158, 164]. Even after accounting for par-
ticipant ﬂuctuations and global baryon number conservation we observe deviations in κ4/κ2 and κ6/κ2
from unity, although they are somewhat reduced. This motivates our experimental program of measuring
higher moments of net-proton distributions at the LHC energies. Also, ﬂuctuation measurements are
underway in the strange baryon sector to approach measurements of net baryon number ﬂuctuations. All
this will be greatly helped by the anticipated dramatic increase in statistics in Runs 3 and 4.

3.3.3 Projections for HL-LHC

As discussed above, precise studies of the higher-order cumulants of particle multiplicity distributions
are needed to verify theoretical predictions. In this section we estimate the statistics needed to address
these measurements with the ALICE experiment. For this purpose two distinct Monte Carlo simulations
have been developed. In the ﬁrst approach, following recent developments in [165], the probability dis-
tribution function of net-protons is approximated by a superposition of two Gaussian distributions which
has four free parameters. Using the experimentally measured second cumulant of net-protons for 0-5
% most central Pb–Pb collisions [163] and the κ4/κ2 and κ6/κ2 ratios from the PQM model [150],
absolute values for κ4 and κ6 were obtained ﬁrst. These values were adjusted to account for ﬂuctuations
from participant nucleons in 0-5% most central Pb–Pb collisions and global baryon number conser-
vation [157, 158]. Finally, the free parameters of the double Gaussian distribution were ﬁxed using the
expected values of κ1 , κ2 , κ4 and κ6 , where κ1 equals zero by deﬁnition. The event-by-event net-proton
number was sampled from the double Gaussian function thus generating the net-proton distribution for
a given number of events. In the second approach the probability distribution functions of protons and
anti-protons are calculated separately by exploiting the Pearson curve method [166]. This approach also
needs four measurements as inputs, which are taken as the ﬁrst four cumulants of the proton and anti-
proton multiplicities measured by ALICE [167]. The net-proton distribution for a given number of events
is constructed by sampling the obtained proton and anti-proton probability distribution functions. In each
approach, the resulting statistical uncertainties are obtained using the subsample method.

The obtained results for κ4/κ2 and κ6/κ2 and their corresponding statistical uncertainties are
shown in Fig. 7 as a function of the simulated event statistics. The dashed red lines correspond to the
input values predicted by PQM calculations of critical ﬂuctuations (CF) and assuming a double Gaussian
net-proton distribution, while the green dashed lines come from the Pearson curve method based on
the lower-order cumulants measured by ALICE. As expected, with increasing statistics both κ4/κ2 and
κ6/κ2 approach their nominal values. The statistics necessary to measure these cumulants are presented
in the bottom panels of Fig. 7, where the deviations of the expected values from unity are quantiﬁed in

35

1-0.5-00.511.52k4k2k4k2k6kunits of the magnitudes of the statistical uncertainty (σ). As seen from the left panel of Fig. 7, for κ4/κ2
already 10 million events are sufﬁcient to distinguish the expected critical ﬂuctuations signal from unity
with a statistical signiﬁcance of 4σ. Similar conclusions are obtained with the Pearson curve method.
Several times this amount of data has already been recorded by ALICE, and the expected statistics in
Runs 3 and 4 will make it possible to measure κ4/κ2 with unprecedented precision.

For κ6/κ2, however, signiﬁcantly larger event sample is needed. As seen from the right panel of
Fig. 7, more than 5 billion 0-5 % central events generated with the double Gaussian approach are needed
in order to observe statistically signiﬁcant deviations from unity in favor of the critical values indicated
with the red dashed line. These would correspond to a minimum bias Pb–Pb integrated luminosity
1 in Runs 3 and 4. Results obtained with the Pearson curve method indicate that more
of 12.5 nb−
than 200 million 0-5 % central events (corresponding to a minimum bias Pb–Pb integrated luminosity
1) would be sufﬁcient in order to claim a signiﬁcant deviation from unity in favour of the
of 0.5 nb−
corresponding expected value. This difference in the estimation of the required statistics for κ6/κ2 comes
mainly from the different baseline values of -1.43 and -0.27 used in the Pearson and double-Gaussian
methods, respectively. In addition, the value of κ2 used in the Pearson method is about two times smaller
than measured in the experiment and used in the double Gaussian method. Track reconstruction and
particle identiﬁcation efﬁciency in the ﬁducial acceptance in η and pT efﬁciencies, which would increase
the required number of events for a given statistical precision, are not included in the study presented
here because they depend on the details of the analysis. Considering that these efﬁciencies are expected
1 foreseen in
to range from 60% to 80%, we conclude that the Pb–Pb integrated luminosity of 13 nb−
Runs 3 and 4 (see Ch. 12) will be sufﬁcient to probe the critical phenomena contained in κ6/κ2.

Introduction

It is particularly interesting to study the macroscopic properties of the QGP ﬂuid because - at least con-
ceptually - they are fully ﬁxed by the microscopic properties of a renormalizable, fundamental quantum
ﬁeld theory, namely QCD. One key question is how macroscopic properties of QGP arise from its micro-
scopic interactions. Many theoretical methods ranging from perturbative to non-perturbative techniques
are being developed to understand this in detail and one can expect that the insights gained here will be
valuable for many related problems in ﬁelds ranging from condensed matter theory to cosmology in the
future. Many different fronts of research are being explored at the moment. This ranges from concep-
tual questions on how to consistently formulate relativistic ﬂuid dynamics or how to solve quantum ﬁeld
theory in non-equilibrium situations to very concrete practical questions about the thermodynamic and
transport properties (such as viscosities or conductivities) of the QGP. The description of the initial state
– prior to QGP formation – and the mechanism by which the products of the collision rapidly thermalize
are also under investigation. Besides the role of strong interactions, also electromagnetic interactions
and in particular the role of magnetic ﬁelds are being explored. Other fronts of research concern the
role of quantum anomalies, chirality and vorticity or the dependence of collective behavior on system
size (nucleus-nucleus versus proton-nucleus and proton-proton collisions), on centrality and collision
energy, the initial state directly after the collision, or various types of ﬂuctuations. These challenges are
discussed in more detail in this section.

4.2 Review of current status of theory on bulk and ﬂow observables

4.2.1 QCD Equation of State

±

156.5

The QCD equation of state, accessible in high-energy collisions (and in the region around mid-rapidity)
is one that has vanishing baryon chemical potential. It has been established for some time that it features
a crossover transition to a chirally symmetric quark gluon plasma [133]. Most recent lattice calcula-
1.5 MeV. Recent efforts
tions [168] have determined the cross-over temperature to be Tc (cid:39)
are also exploring the equation of state at ﬁnite µB, which at LHC would have relevance mainly at very
forward rapidities. Here, because of the fermion sign problem in lattice QCD, methods like Taylor ex-
pansion [169–172] or imaginary chemical potentials [173–177] have to be used. To employ lattice QCD
based equations of state in hydrodynamic calculations, they need to be matched to a hadron resonance
gas model at low temperatures. Various equations of state [50, 178, 179], using different lattice data and
different matching conditions have been used in simulations. A comparison of some of them can be
found in [180], where the sensitivity of observables to the choice of equation of state was studied. For a
recent theoretical proposal on how to gain experimental sensitivity on the equation of state, see ref. [181].
Currently available data are consistent with the lattice QCD equation of state, however with an
50 %
error. To reduce the uncertainty, measurements of particle spectra over a wide range of colliding energies
using a single detector with good particle identiﬁcation, especially at low transverse momentum, would
be needed. Another possibility to constrain the equation of state from experimental data would be to
extend state of the art Bayesian techniques [182] to include free parameters describing the equation of
state and ﬁt them along with other free parameters such as shear and bulk viscosities.

4.2.2 Shear and bulk viscosities of hot nuclear matter

Ideal ﬂuid dynamics has been very successful in describing a variety of bulk observables in heavy ion
collisions [183–185], indicating early on that the shear and bulk viscosities of the produced matter cannot
be large. Calculations in the strong coupling limit using gauge gravity duality have found a value of
η/s = 1/4π for an N = 4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills quantum system [186, 187]. This value was
signiﬁcantly smaller than the η/s obtained in perturbative QCD calculations, which were however, beset
by signiﬁcant uncertainties, mainly resulting from uncertainties in the relevant scales [188]. Recently,
such perturbative calculations have been extended to include next-to-leading order corrections and a
signiﬁcant reduction compared to the leading order result was found [189]: At temperatures of the order
of the QCD transition the η/s obtained using NLO corrections is smaller by a factor of 5 compared
to the LO result, and reaches values of approximately 2/4π. Extractions of transport coefﬁcients from
lattice QCD calculations [190–192] are extraordinarily hard, because a numerically difﬁcult analytic
continuation from imaginary to real times is necessary.

There are also several theoretical indications that bulk viscosity could play an important role in
the QGP to hadron gas transition region (see [193] and references therein). Perturbative calculations

yield large values of ζ/s (
show a fast drop of ζ/s with increasing T . Parametrizations of the bulk viscosity over entropy density’s
temperature dependence were performed in [199] with input from [196] for the QGP phase and [200] for
the hadronic phase. Similar to the case of shear viscosity, bulk viscosity over entropy density ratios have
been determined also in holographic models that are supplemented with non-conformal features [201,
202]. In this approach, the ζ/s reaches a much lower peak value
0.05 at temperatures slightly above
Tc [202]. It remains to be understood to what extent this provides semi-quantitative guidance for the
value in QCD.

Apart from theoretical calculations of the shear and bulk viscous properties, one may also con-
strain them by means of ﬂuid dynamic simulations and comparison to experimental data [203,204]. This
method suffers mainly from uncertainties in the initial state (see also Section 4.2.3) and has an uncer-
tainty of approximately a factor of 3 (for η/s) at this point. Some of the latest constraints come from
simulations using the IP-Glasma initial state [205, 206], the EKRT model [207] and Bayesian analyses
employing the Trento initial state model [182]. In terms of the Viscous corrections to the distribution
function at freeze-out, the low-pT range of the spectrum is more sensitive to the bulk viscosity than to
the shear viscosity [208, 209]. Consequently, the uncertainties resulting from bulk viscous corrections
are typically larger than for shear when studying pT integrated observables. Precise measurements of the
low-pT spectra and mean-pT in different collision systems will help in lowering the current uncertainties,
speciﬁcally in the extraction of ζ/s. In order to disentangle features of the initial state and medium prop-
erties, it might be useful to study additional collision systems such as Ar–Ar or O–O and to perform a
more detailed global analysis including reﬁned data on harmonic ﬂow coefﬁcients for identiﬁed particles
that become available during Run 3 and 4 (see Section 4.3.1).

4.2.3

Initial conditions

Modelling the exact geometry and initial conditions for a ﬂuid dynamic description of heavy ion colli-
sions is not a simple task, because it involves non-perturbative physics. The available descriptions for the
initial state thus range from very simplistic models that assign deposited energy densities based on the
wounded nucleons or binary collisions determined in a Monte-Carlo Glauber prescription, to classical
effective theories of QCD that are valid in the high energy limit. The major ingredient that needs to be
provided by an initial state model is the geometry of the interaction region in the plane transverse to the
beam. It is entirely dominated by the positions of incoming nucleons whose ﬂuctuations also play an
important role.

38

Initial conditions for hydrodynamic simulations have to provide, in principle, all components of
the energy momentum tensor as a function of spatial position (and initial conditions for other conserved
charges, if considered). This includes, apart from the always included energy density distribution, the
initial ﬂow as well as initial viscous corrections. Initial ﬂow is included in many recently developed
models, that either assume free streaming [182], including Yang-Mills evolution, which is close to free
streaming [210] or an initial ﬂow distribution motivated by strong coupling calculations [211]. Initial
viscous corrections are often set to zero. Only a few works [182, 212, 213] include the full viscous stress
tensor provided by the initial state description.

Since the initial state models that provide the entire T µν all switch from essentially a freely stream-
ing system to strongly interacting hydrodynamics at a ﬁxed time τ , that transition is somewhat abrupt and
unphysical. To improve over this situation an intermediate step using effective kinetic theory has been
introduced [214, 215]. This procedure allows for a somewhat smoother matching but has yet to be used
in full ﬂedged hydrodynamic simulations. A ﬁrst study that matches full kinetic theory to full viscous
ﬂuid dynamics indicates that the intermediate kinetic transport formulation becomes more important with
decreasing system size [216].

As already discussed in Section 4.2.2, the choice of initial state has a signiﬁcant effect on the
extraction of transport coefﬁcients. A more compact initial state and the presence of initial ﬂow lead to a
larger transverse ﬂow, which requires a larger bulk viscosity to compensate for it and produce agreement
with experimental data [213]. In addition the initial ﬂow also affects the value of the extracted shear
viscosity. Also, the models’ eccentricities will affect the ﬁnal momentum anisotropies, inﬂuencing the
extracted shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. Two possible attempts to solve this problem have been
pursued: the ﬁrst is to perform a combined Bayesian analysis of all parameters [182], including those
of the initial state, to ﬁnd the best ﬁt for all transport coefﬁcients along with the initial state description.
The second is to constrain an initial state description as well as possible using data from experiments
other than heavy ion collisions e.g. e–p scattering data, which will hopefully be extended to e–A in a
future electron ion collider facility. As mentioned above, at the moment the two approaches lead to some
similar features of the initial state (product of thickness functions, presence of subnucleon structure), but
also show discrepancies (size of the nucleon and sub-nucleon scales along with the size of the extracted
bulk viscosity). In the near future, ﬂow measurements in light ion collisions such as Ar–Ar, O–O etc.
can also provide independent experimental constraints on initial conditions (see Section 4.3.2). Similarly,
new ﬂow observables can also help constrain the initial conditions. In particular the measurement of ﬂow
ﬂuctuations has provided constraints on initial geometry models, in both the approaches discussed above.
Analogously, the more recent studies of longitudinal ﬂow ﬂuctuations [217–219] and their extensions in
Run 3 and 4 (see Section 4.3.3) can provide additional constraints.

4.2.4 Response functions

In a ﬂuid dynamic description of heavy ion collisions, one can understand the azimuthal harmonic ﬂow
coefﬁcients vn as a response to deviations of the initial state from an azimuthally isotropic form. Math-
ematically, one can formulate this in terms of response functions that describe how the solution of the
ﬂuid dynamic evolution equations, as well as resulting experimental observables such as azimuthal par-
ticle distributions, get modiﬁed when the initial values of the ﬂuid ﬁelds are changed [220–222]. In the
simplest implementation, linear response functions describe the linear response of ﬂow coefﬁcients to
(cid:15)a(cid:15)b where sym-
(cid:15)n, while the quadratic response functions describe terms like vn ∼
eccentricities vn ∼
metry reasons imply
[223,224]. Response functions can not only be used to study deviations
n
|
from azimuthal rotation symmetry but also for deviations from (approximate) Bjorken boost invariance,
vanishing baryon number density, for electric ﬁelds and so on. Quite generally, response functions carry
interesting information about ﬂuid properties such as thermodynamic and transport properties. Where
the response functions are known, one can infer properties of the initial state by reverse engineering. Ex-
perimentally, one can constrain properties of response functions indirectly via measurements of various

particle correlation functions. It is particularly interesting to compare situations with strong deviations
from a symmetry (such as peripheral collisions for the case of azimuthal rotation invariance) to situations
with small deviations (such as central collisions) in order to differentiate between linear and non-linear
response. For existing experimental work in this direction see [225–227] and for an example of a recent
further going theoretical proposal see [228].

Detailed comparison of ﬂow observables between experiment and theoretical calculations, espe-
cially regarding the dependence on external parameters like system size and collision energy as well as
differential information such as on centrality, or particle identiﬁcation will be helpful to make further
progress in constraining response functions. Improvements in particle identiﬁcation, transverse momen-
tum and longitudinal coverage in Run 3 and 4 will be particularly valuable to this end.

4.3 Experimental constraints from Run 3 and 4

Since measurements of ﬂow and correlations provide arguably the most direct manifestations of col-
lectivity, they play naturally a central role in the scientiﬁc programme of exploring ﬁnite temperature
QCD via collectivity. At the HL-LHC, much more stringent tests of the collective dynamics in nucleus–
nucleus collisions will be possible. These will constrain QGP medium properties and initial conditions,
as discussed in the previous section, in great detail. In the following, these newly arising opportunities
are illustrated with a set of physics performance studies exploiting: 1) high-statistics particle-identiﬁed
ﬂow measurements, 2) system-size dependence of ﬂow, and 3) longitudinal ﬂow ﬂuctuations.

In a ﬂuid dynamic picture of A–A collisions, hadrons decouple from the ﬂuid at late times, when
the density of the system is sufﬁciently low and the mean-free path is sufﬁciently large so that a ﬂuid
dynamic description ceases to apply. Therefore, it is a direct consequence of this late time-scale, that the
PID-dependence of vn measurements tests a limitation of ﬂuid dynamic behavior. Do all hadron species
emerge from the same common ﬂow ﬁeld? Or can one see at the higher accuracy of future vn mea-
surements particle speciﬁc differences in the decoupling which are related to the differences in hadronic
cross sections? Quantitative questions of this kind will allow one to better constrain how signiﬁcant the
hadronic stage of A–A collisions contribute to vn, and since the viscous properties of QCD change signif-
icantly in the hadronic stage, this is of direct relevance for extracting information about viscous transport
coefﬁcients with higher precision. The same class of improved PID-sensitive vn measurements is also

In particular since fragmentation is
expected to be the dominant hadronization mechanism at high pT while recombination becomes relevant
at lower pT, extending these PID measurements with precision over the largest possible transverse mo-
mentum range will be of interest. To this end, ﬁgure 8 shows projections from the ALICE collaboration
1
for the v2 and v3 of several light-ﬂavor species, that are expected for an integrated luminosity of 10 nb−
expected in Run 3 and 4. The projected statistical uncertainties are typically negligible over the entire pT
range and in most cases the systematic uncertainties are quite small as well. These measurements will be
much more precise compared to those in Run 1 and 2, and will allow for the recombination/fragmentation
descriptions to be examined with unprecedented accuracy. Similar projections for heavy-ﬂavor particles
are discussed further in Chapter 5 together with their physics implications.

4.3.2 System size dependence

predictions from Ref. [229]. Also shown are theory calculations of the ratios for Ar–Ar and O–O.

In Pb–Pb collisions, previous vn measurements at the LHC have accessed the system size depen-
dence of ﬂow via the centrality dependence. However, this centrality dependence is biased by a strong
variation of the spatial eccentricity of the nuclear overlap. While modelling allows one to control this ec-
centricity dependence to some extent, studying smaller collision systems at highest centrality (i.e. impact
parameter close to zero) remains conceptually the cleanest way of establishing the system size depen-
dence of ﬂow. It also provides a way of disentangling the event-averaged spatial eccentricity from the

condition from which collective behaviour emerges. These are important motivations for studying soft
multi-particle production and its transverse asymmetries in the collision of lighter nuclei.

Figure 9 shows ATLAS comparisons of the vn in Xe–Xe and Pb–Pb collisions as a function of
centrality (left panels) and their ratios (right panels). Also shown for comparison in the right panels
are theoretical predictions for the ratios from Ref. [229]. It is seen that in most central collisions the
ratio vn (Xe–Xe)/vn (Pb–Pb) is larger than unity for n = 2 and 3. With decreasing centrality the ratios
for all harmonics show a decreasing trend. These trends can be explained as follows: Xe–Xe being a
smaller system than Pb–Pb, the effect of ﬂuctuations is more important. The ﬂuctuations increase the
initial eccentricities of the collision geometry and therefore enhance the vn. However, because Xe–Xe
is a smaller collision system the viscous effects (which suppress the vn) are larger, and play a bigger
role with decreasing centrality and increasing harmonic order. In most central events, the effect of the
increased ﬂuctuations wins for v2. But with increasing harmonic order and/or decreasing centrality,
eventually the viscous effects reduce the vn compared to Pb–Pb. These observations indicate the ability
of such cross-system vn measurements to be very sensitive to initial conditions of the heavy ion collision
as well as the transport coefﬁcients of the QGP. The measured ratios for the vn (Xe–Xe)/vn (Pb–Pb) are
qualitatively reproduced by the theory predictions from Ref. [229]. In order to illustrate the sensitivity of
such models to the collision species, predictions are also presented for Ar–Ar and O–O collisions. The
predictions show considerably larger variation of the centrality dependence of the vn going from Xe–Xe
to Ar–Ar to O–O, as compared to the variation going from Pb–Pb to Xe–Xe. Given such strong trends
in the theory predictions, performing vn measurements in light ion species such as Ar–Ar and O–O in
Run 3 can provide strong constrains on the theoretical models.

Furthermore, there has been much work in studying long-range correlations observed in p–A, d–
A, 3He–A, and more recently in pp collisions (see Chapter 9). Measuring ﬂow in medium and light
ions would allow for a continuous study of how collective phenomena vary from large (Pb–Pb) to small
(p–A and pp) systems.

4.3.3 Longitudinal ﬂow ﬂuctuations

The characterization of how the longitudinal scales at which the symmetry planes Ψn associated to
vn decorrelate, and how this relates to the variation of the signal strength vn with rapidity is still far
from the state of the art reached in vn measurements at mid-rapidity. However, any deviation from
the simple picture of a rapidity-independent (Bjorken-like) longitudinal dynamics directly impacts our
understanding of the time evolution of matter in all rapidity windows, including the well studied mid-
rapidity one. Multiple recent measurements at the LHC indicate the presence of considerable longitudinal
dynamics. These include measurements from CMS of event-plane decorrelation in p–Pb and Pb–Pb
collisions [217, 218] and from ATLAS on ﬂow-decorrelations [219] and forward-backward multiplicity
ﬂuctuations [231]. It is therefore important that experiments at the HL-LHC will parallel higher precision
measurements at mid-rapidity with improved experimental control over the longitudinal evolution.

In the ATLAS measurements in Ref. [219], the ﬂow decorrelation is quantiﬁed by constructing a

The longitudinal ﬂow-decorrelation observables are sensitive to the event by event ﬂuctuations
of the initial energy density proﬁle in the longitudinal direction. Thus precise measurement of these
decorrelations should give a better understanding of the initial conditions along the longitudinal direction
and in the development of full three-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic models. These would in turn
result in a more accurate estimation of η/s.

4.4 Vorticity and polarization

An interesting open question for relativistic ﬂuids is to what extent the spin degrees of freedom thermalize
locally and to what extend spin polarization results as a consequence of the ﬂuid motion. Intuitively, one
might expect that spin aligns locally with the rotational motion of the ﬂuid as measured by vorticity,
corresponding to the curl of the ﬂuid velocity.

The relativistic generalization of the non-relativistic ﬂuid vorticity is not unambiguous, however.
The vorticity of a ﬂuid in local equilibrium is characterized by the so-called thermal vorticity tensor,
corresponding to ωµν = 1

perature [232]. This thermal vorticity includes contributions from global rotational motion, local ﬂuid
acceleration, and temperature gradients. It has been argued that this thermal vorticity should lead to local

If this holds at chemical freeze-out, one should be able to ﬁnd traces of the thermal
vorticity in the spin polarization of particles and resonances, such as Λ (Λ) particles.

Spin polarization is in this picture closely tied to angular momentum of the expanding ﬁreball.
For non-central events, the angular momentum of the produced matter is perpendicular to the event
plane. Via the spin-vorticity coupling mechanism, this leads to a global polarization in the transverse
plane aligning with the global angular momentum (also known as the “transverse polarization”). This
global transverse polarization has recently been observed in the measurement of Λ spin polarization
at RHIC [233]. For this global effect following global angular momentum, one expects a decreasing
magnitude with increasing collision energy and the effect is expected to be relatively small at LHC
energies.

boxes) represent the statistical (systematic) uncertainties. Figure from Ref. [1].

Figure 11 shows the energy dependence of the global transverse polarization of Λ and Λ for semi-
central heavy ion collisions. The RHIC results show the decrease of polarization with increasing √sNN.
The preliminary ALICE data point at √sNN = 2.76 TeV is consistent with zero within 1σ statisti-
cal/systematic uncertainties. However it is also consistent with the predicted maximum value (blue line)
within
2σ statistical/systematic uncertainties. But the ALICE upgrade projection at twice large colli-
sion energy, (assuming zero signal) shows that the polarization in Run 3 and 4 can be measured with very
high precision. Therefore the study of global polarization of Λ and Λ within HL–LHC project allows the
unambiguous conclusion with regard of the values of this physics quantity in the TeV-energy domain.

In addition to the transverse polarization, an azimuthal-dependent, longitudinal polarization (in
the direction of the beam pipe) has also been predicted and recently observed at RHIC [236]. This

(e.g., the elliptic ﬂow), which could lead to an elliptic modulation of longitudinal spin polarization in
non-central collisions. Unlike the global transverse polarization, this longitudinal polarization effect
has a much weaker dependence on collision energy from RHIC to the LHC [237], mainly because the
anisotropic ﬂow has a weak collision energy dependence. With increased data sample and upgraded
detectors covering a wider rapidity range in the HL–LHC era, there will be exciting opportunities for
precision study of the Λ polarization and to map out the dependence on variables such as azimuthal
angle, rapidity, transverse momentum.

4.5 Chiral Magnetic Effect

An important property of the strong interaction which is potentially observable in heavy-ion collisions
is parity violation. Although it is allowed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), global parity violation
is not observed in strong interaction. However, QCD predicts the existence of topologically non-trivial
conﬁgurations of the gluonic ﬁeld, instantons and sphalerons, which might be responsible for local parity
violation in microscopic QCD domains at ﬁnite temperature [238–241]. The P - and CP -odd interac-
tions between quarks and such ﬁelds with non-zero topological charge [242] change the quark chiral-
ity, breaking parity symmetry by creating an imbalance between the number of left- and right-handed
quarks. Furthermore, an extremely strong magnetic ﬁeld is expected to be produced in heavy-ion colli-
sions [243,244] (of the order of 1019 Gauss at the LHC) because the charges of initial ions add coherently.
This strong magnetic ﬁeld aligns the spins of the positively (negatively) charged quarks in the direction
parallel (anti-parallel) to magnetic ﬁeld orientation. Moreover, right-handed (left-handed) quarks have
their direction of momentum parallel (anti-parallel) to the spin orientation. The spin alignment coupled
with the local imbalance between the number of left- and right-handed quarks leads to the development
of a quark current. The current moves the positively charged quarks along its direction and the nega-
tively charged quarks in the opposite direction. This implies a charge separation along the direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld, which is on average perpendicular to the reaction plane, a phenomenon called Chiral
Magnetic Effect (CME) [245–248].

The sign of the topological charge can give rise to a positive or negative current in the magnetic
ﬁeld direction with equal probability. Therefore, the charge separation averaged over many events is
zero. This makes the observation of the CME experimentally difﬁcult and possible only via azimuthal
particle correlations, which introduces a large ﬂow related background into the measurements.

The three-particle correlator γαβ =

angle of the particle of charge α and Ψ2 is the second harmonic symmetry plane angle, was proposed
to measure charge-dependent azimuthal correlations. This correlator eliminates correlations independent
of symmetry plane orientation, suppressing background contributions at the level of
v2. However,
local
the interpretation of the experimental results is complicated by the remaining background (e.g.
charge conservation (LCC) coupled with elliptic ﬂow [251, 252]). Recent observation of similar charge-
dependent azimuthal correlations in p–Pb (where the CME is not expected) and Pb–Pb collisions [253]
indicates the γαβ correlator be dominated, if not all, by the background effect. The ALICE [249] and
CMS [254] collaborations have used the Event Shape Engineering (ESE) technique [255] to estimate the
CME fraction to the charge dependence of γαβ, fCME, in Pb–Pb collisions. ALICE extracted fCME by
relating measurements of the charge dependence of γαβ from the ESE analysis to CME signal expecta-
tions from various initial state model calculations including a magnetic ﬁeld. It has been assumed that
the CME signal is proportional to
and ΨB are the magnitude and
direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, respectively. Within current experimental uncertainties, the CME signal
contribution to the γαβ correlator is consistent with zero.

indicates that stringent constraints for the CME contribution to the charge dependence of γαβ can be
achieved at a level of less than 1% with the expected HL–LHC statistics.

One key ingredient needed for the observation of the CME is the strong magnetic ﬁeld in the QGP
medium. It is important to establish direct evidence for this ﬁeld and determine its strength, which will
help signiﬁcantly constrain theoretical predictions on the magnitude of the CME signal. Measurement
of the pseudorapidity-odd component of directed ﬂow, vodd
, separately for positive and negative charged
particles has been proposed as a probe to the magnetic ﬁeld [244]. Any difference will indicate the
presence of induced electromagnetic currents and will allow to estimate the magnitude of the effect. It
will also provide information on the electric conductivity of the QGP medium.

4.6 Summary

The measurements of inclusive hadron vn by traditional methods such as two-particle correlations, event-
plane/scalar-product methods, multi-particle cumulants etc. have been performed with high precision by
the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. These inclusive hadron vn measurements are not
statistically limited across most of the centrality-pT phase space and further improvement in the mea-
surements is not a high priority for Run 3 and 4. However, in the case of identiﬁed hadrons the increased
statistics will lead to further improvement in the vn measurements. This is true for both light hadrons
such as pions, protons, φ-mesons as shown in Figure 8, as well as for heavy-ﬂavor particles such as D0,
D±, J/ψ, Υ which are discussed in Chapters 5 and 7, respectively. Signiﬁcant improvements are expected
in measurements of longitudinal ﬂow ﬂuctuations, which have only been brieﬂy investigated in Run 1
and 2. These are largely driven by the increases η acceptance of the ATLAS and CMS tracking detec-
tors in Run 4, the acceptance is planned to reach
5 units. The study of longitudinal ﬂow ﬂuctuations
±
will allow comparisons to predictions of 3+1D hydro models. Flow measurements in light ions such as
Ar–Ar and O–O, will lead to stronger constraints on theoretical models describing different stages of
a heavy ion collision – initial conditions, equation of state, transport coefﬁcients etc. This is difﬁcult
presently, as ﬂow observables are dependent on all of these, so it becomes difﬁcult to constrain any one
of these without full knowledge of the others. Flow measurements across a variety of colliding species
will provide independent data that will improve our understanding of the different stages of heavy ion
collisions. Further physics motivations for colliding light ions are discussed in Chapter 11.1.

ited and are expected to improve considerably are related to effects of vorticity and magnetic ﬁelds. The
current measurements of Λ polarization from ALICE are statistics limited and consistent with both the
null hypothesis as well as with the theoretically predicated value. The ALICE projections for Λ polariza-
tion in Run 3 and 4 show that the measurements will have signiﬁcantly smaller statistical uncertainties
and will differentiate between the null and predicted values. ALICE and CMS have measured the frac-
tion of the three-particle correlator γαβ that arises from CME effects: fCME. The measured fCME by
ALICE is consistent with zero but due to large uncertainties its upper limit at 95% CL can be as large
as
0.5. ALICE projections for Run 3 and 4 show that the fCME can be determined with a precision of
better than 1%.

5.1 Perspectives for heavy-ﬂavour observables in LHC Run 3 and 4

Charm and beauty quarks are produced in hard scattering processes occurring in the early stage of heavy-
ion collisions. They subsequently traverse the QGP medium and interact with its constituents through
inelastic (gluon radiation) and elastic (or collisional) processes. These interactions may lead to the
thermalisation of low-momentum heavy quarks, which would thus take part in the expansion and hadro-
nisation of the medium. For these reasons, heavy-ﬂavour hadrons provide information on all stages of
the system evolution and they uniquely probe the quark-mass dependence of the QGP inner workings
(see Refs. [258–260] for recent reviews).

Many experimental observations from RHIC and LHC showed evidence that charm and beauty
quarks interact strongly with the QGP and that beauty quarks lose less energy at low transverse mo-
mentum compared to charm quarks [261, 262]. While data are becoming more and more precise to start
imposing constraints on theoretical calculations, there are still several unresolved questions: What are
the microscopic mechanisms that drive heavy-ﬂavour interaction and diffusion in the QGP, and what
are their implications for the QCD matter structure? What is the relative relevance of collisional and
radiative processes? Can the same QCD process can describe both the heavy-quark interaction with the
strongly coupled plasma and the mechanisms of hadronisation?

The Run 3 and 4 of the LHC will open a new precision era for heavy-ﬂavour measurements in
heavy-ion collisions that will address the above questions. With the upgrades of the machine and of the
tracking detectors, the higher accumulated statistics and higher precision will make it possible to quantify
the properties of the QGP with heavy-ﬂavour probes. This high-precision era will also make new and
more differential observables accessible for the ﬁrst time. The key measurements that are expected to
have a strong impact on the characterisation of the QGP with heavy-ﬂavour observables are discussed in
this chapter and summarized below.

– Nuclear modiﬁcation factor and ﬂow harmonics: these measurements for particles with charm and
beauty in the large kinematic range covered by combining the different LHC experiments will
put the strongest constraints on the transport coefﬁcients of the QGP, clarifying the microscopic
mechanisms governing the interactions of heavy quarks with the medium, and quantifying their
degree of thermalisation.

49

– Strange D and B mesons, charm and beauty baryons: currently limited by statistics, these mea-
surements will help to quantify not only the degree of thermalisation of heavy quarks, but also
the contribution of recombination with lighter quarks to the hadronisation process. They are also
sensitive to the mass scaling of the hyrodynamical ﬂow in the heavy-ﬂavour sector.

– Heavy-ﬂavour correlations and jet observables: they will provide new insights on the parton mass
effects in parton showers, on the redistribution of the radiated energy, and on the role of collisional
and radiative energy loss.

5.2

Impact of detector upgrades on heavy-ﬂavour measurements

The upgrades of the four large LHC experiments during LS2 and LS3 will strongly enhance their per-
formance for open heavy-ﬂavour measurements. The detector improvements that will have the largest
impact are the new silicon trackers, with higher granularity and precision, as well as extended pseudo-
rapidity coverage. Brief descriptions of these improvements are reported in the following.

– ALICE. The new Inner Tracking System [263], which will be installed during LS2, is composed of
5 µm2 and a material
seven layers of pixel detectors with an intrinsic spatial precision of about 5
thickness of 0.3% of the radiation length in the innermost layers. The track pointing resolution
will be improved by a factor 3 in the direction transverse to the beam line and by a factor 5 in
the longitudinal direction, down to values of about 20 µm for tracks with pT = 1 GeV/c. A
Muon Forward Tracker [4], composed of 5 disks of pixel detectors with the same spatial resolution
as the Inner Tracking System, will instrument the region 2.5 < η < 3.6, in front of the muon
spectrometer, enabling the separation from the primary vertex of single and dimuons from D, B
and J/ψ decays. The upgraded TPC with GEM-based readout chambers, together with readout
upgrades of several other detectors and with a new Online-Ofﬂine computing system, will enable
the full recording of Pb–Pb interactions with a minimum-bias trigger at a rate of 50 kHz, which
is 50-fold larger than for the present apparatus.

– ATLAS. The Inner Tracker (ITk) [264] will be an all-silicon tracker composed of pixels and strips
installed during LS3 for ATLAS phase II. The ITk will provide charged-particle tracking accep-
tance for
< 4. The performance of the ITk in Pb–Pb collisions is expected to be comparable
to pp collisions. The High Granularity Timing Detector [265] has been proposed to complement
the spatial information of the ITk with timing information. These detectors will improve jet recon-
struction capabilities, and in particular tagging of heavy-ﬂavour jets, as well as all studies using
charged particles.

– CMS. The following upgrades scheduled for LS3 will largely enhance the performance for heavy-
ﬂavour measurements, in particular in the low-momentum region [266]. The upgraded inner
< 4 [267]. The improved L1 and DAQ rate (up
tracker will cover a large acceptance up to
to 60 GB/s) will allow more sophisticated triggers and to record a larger number of minimum-bias
triggered events. In addition, the proposed MIP Timing Detector [268] with a radius of 1.16 m and
30 ps could provide, in conjunction with other detectors, proton, pion and
a time resolution of
kaon separation in the interval 0.7 < pT < 2 GeV/c in

< 1.5.

– LHCb. The experiment is preparing to run at ﬁve times larger instantaneous luminosities in pp
collisions, processing the full event rate with a software trigger and preserving or exceeding the
present performance. All tracking detectors will be upgraded during LS2 [269,270]. Most notably
for heavy-ﬂavour observables, the active area of the upgraded Vertex Locator, the pixel detector
replacing the present silicon strip detector, will move as close as 5.1 mm to the nominal beam spot.
The larger granularity for the majority of phase space will improve the performance in Pb–Pb
collisions whereas proton-induced reactions will result in average in lower detector occupancies
than the standard pp running.

5.3 Nuclear modiﬁcation factor and collective ﬂow

The standard observable used to study the medium effects on heavy-ﬂavour meson production is the
nuclear modiﬁcation factor (RAA), deﬁned as the ratio of the Pb–Pb yield to the pp cross-section scaled
by the nuclear overlap function. In the view of the pQCD-based models, heavy quarks interact with
the medium constituents via radiative and collisional processes. While radiative interactions only lead to
energy loss, collisional ones can also result in an increase of the heavy-quark momentum. The dead-cone
effect [271] is expected to reduce small-angle gluon radiation of heavy quarks when compared to both
gluons and light quarks. At low pT, the production rate of heavy-ﬂavour mesons in heavy-ion collisions
is sensitive to the elastic energy loss of the heavy quark in medium, the nuclear shadowing effect in
the initial state, and the recombination of the heavy quark with light quarks at the hadronization stage.
At high pT, the nuclear modiﬁcation factor is sensitive to the medium-induced radiative energy loss of
heavy quarks. Precise measurements of the RAA thus provide insights on the momentum dependence of
heavy quark energy loss, and provide important tests of QCD predictions, in particular for the expected
ﬂavour and mass dependence of the energy loss processes.

Another interesting observable is the azimuthal anisotropy of open heavy ﬂavour production,
which can be characterized by the Fourier coefﬁcients vn in the azimuthal angle (ϕ) distribution of
the heavy-ﬂavour hadron yield with respect to the reaction plane in non-central Pb–Pb collisions. At
low pT, the v2 measurements can provide important insights into the mechanisms of interaction of heavy
quarks with the medium and on their strength (as discussed in more details in Sec. 5.3.2). Heavy quarks
are indeed expected to acquire a positive v2 mostly as a consequence of their interaction with the light
quarks of the medium. Measurements of elliptic ﬂow of heavy hadrons are also sensitive to hadroni-
sation processes. In particular, they can be used to study the relevance of heavy-ﬂavour recombination
(see Sect. 5.4.1) in which heavy-quarks can acquire additional v2 by combining with light quarks at the
hadronisation stage. At high pT, v2 of heavy-ﬂavour hadrons is sensitive to the path-length dependence of
heavy quark energy loss. The simultaneous description of RAA and v2 for heavy-ﬂavour hadrons is still
challenging for most of the theoretical calculations, because it entails accurate modelling of the initial
heavy-quark production and its modiﬁcation in nuclei, of the medium and its expansion, of the various
quark-medium interaction mechanisms and of the possible modiﬁcation of hadronisation processes.

5.3.2 Constraining the heavy-quark diffusion coefﬁcient 2πT Ds

Many theoretical efforts have been recently undertaken to understand the properties of the QGP medium
and the interaction between heavy quarks and the medium constituents, see Refs. [258–260] for recent
reviews. Although the interaction mechanism can widely vary among different theoretical models, the
reduction to a few transport coefﬁcients allows one to compare these models and evaluate different mi-
croscopic pictures. Most of the present theoretical models explain the interactions of heavy quarks as
dominated by collisional (elastic) processes in the low transverse momentum region (up to about 5–
10 GeV/c) and by radiative energy loss (inelastic process with gluon radiation off the heavy quark) at
higher pT.

the high-precision measurements in Run 3 and Run 4. In particular, the pT-dependence of this coefﬁcient
provides important constraints on the weakening of the interaction strength with increasing pT. For il-
lustration, the extracted values of Ds is considered at a ﬁxed pT value. The heavy-quark spatial diffusion

T Ds,
where mQ is the quark mass and T is the medium temperature [272].

uncertainties reduced factors of two or ﬁve are considered for illustration. In the projections for Lint =
1 shown in the previous section, the D-meson RAA uncertainties are reduced by a factor between
10 nb−
two and ﬁve, depending on pT, with respect to the present measurements. Considering the 2πT Ds range
with χ2
RAA/n.d.f < 1.5 (corresponding to 85% conﬁdence), it is found that by reducing the present
experimental uncertainty by a factor two or ﬁve, the uncertainty on the estimation 2πT Ds would be
also reduced almost to 50% or 20%, respectively. The right panel presents the diffusion coefﬁcient as a
function of temperature, which is estimated using a Bayesian calibration on D-meson RAA and v2 in Pb–
Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV for different centralities. The 2πT Ds shows a positive temperature dependence
with the minimum value around Tc. Such behaviour is consistent with the Bayesian estimation for shear
viscosity η/s. The potential improvement with Run 3 and Run 4 measurements is estimated using the
RAA and v2 projections by ALICE and CMS shown in the previous section and it is shown by the
red band. With these future experimental measurements, the diffusion coefﬁcient around Tc could be
constrained with an uncertainty of about 30–50% of the present one.

5.3.3 D-meson analyses with Event Shape Engineering

Further insight into the dynamics of heavy quarks in the medium can be obtained from measurements
of the yield and elliptic ﬂow of heavy-ﬂavour particles with the Event Shape Engineering (ESE) tech-
nique [255]. This technique consists of selecting events with the same centrality but different magnitude
of the average bulk elliptic ﬂow and therefore initial-state geometry eccentricity. The analyses with ESE
will allow us to investigate the correlation between the ﬂow coefﬁcients of heavy-ﬂavour hadrons and soft
hadrons, to study the interplay between elliptic and radial ﬂow, and to further constrain the path-length
dependence of the energy loss suffered by the heavy quarks in the QGP. A ﬁrst analysis was published
by ALICE using 2015 Pb–Pb data [278]. In the left-hand panel of Fig. 18, the prospects for the measure-
ment of the D0-meson v2 with the ESE technique in the 30–50% centrality class with Lint = 10 nb−
1 are
shown. In particular, the ratio between the v2 of D mesons in the 10% of the events with larger (smaller)

It is compared
to the current measurement of the same ratio for charged particles, which is dominated by light-ﬂavour
hadrons. The expected statistical uncertainties for the D0-meson v2 in the 0–10% of events with larger
(smaller) q2 are of the order of about 1–2% in the interval 1 < pT < 8 GeV/c. This will allow us to
resolve a possible difference of a few percent in the response of the v2 to the ESE selection between
the D0 mesons and the light hadrons, providing new insight on the coupling of the charm quark with
the medium constituents and on its degree of thermalisation. The performance for the measurements of
D0-meson pT-differential yield in event-shape classes is displayed in the right-hand panel of Fig. 18. The
expected performance will provide a sensitivity of a few percent for the modiﬁcation of the D-meson pT
spectra in events with small (large) initial geometrical anisotropy. This will open the way for precise
studies on the interplay between the initial geometrical anisotropy (the collective ﬂow of the bulk) and
the heavy-ﬂavour radial ﬂow and energy loss.

5.4 Studies of heavy-quark hadronisation

5.4.1 Hadronisation mechanisms for c and b quarks

The hadronisation mechanisms belong to the non-perturbative domain of QCD and a ﬁrst-principle
description of these processes is still missing, for both light and heavy ﬂavours. However, from the
study of charm dynamics in nucleus–nucleus collisions in the last decade there is a general consen-
sus that the details of hadronisation have a large effect on both the heavy-ﬂavour observables RAA and
v2 [260, 279, 280]. This section introduces the two main microscopic hadronisation mechanisms for
the production of heavy-ﬂavour hadrons: fragmentation and coalescence (also denoted as recombina-
tion). Fragmentation is one of the most common approaches for the calculation of inclusive hadron
production and it is appropriate for high-momentum partons emerging from initial hard processes, where
high-momentum quarks fragment directly and independently into high-momentum hadrons. Indepen-
dent fragmentation has also been widely applied at low momentum in e+e−, ep and pp collisions. On
the other hand, coalescence is expected to dominate in the low-momentum regime in nucleus–nucleus
collisions, where partons are abundant and heavy quarks can hadronise by recombination with light
quarks [281–283]. Recent measurements at the LHC indicate that fragmentation may not be sufﬁcient
to describe charm quark hadronisation at low momentum in pp and p–Pb collisions, at least for what
concerns baryon production [284, 285].

The hadron momentum spectra produced by heavy-quark fragmentation are given by:

where z = phad/pQ is the fraction of quark momentum carried by the hadron, Q2 = (phad/2z)2 is the
momentum scale for the fragmentation process and Dhad/Q is the fragmentation function.

In the basic coalescence model developed in Refs. [286–292] and used here for illustration, the

spectrum of heavy-ﬂavour hadrons formed by coalescence of heavy-light quarks can be written as

this approach, the same QCD process is responsible for both the interaction of charm quarks with the
strongly-coupled medium and for the process of D-meson formation through recombination [293, 294].

Hadronisation via coalescence leads to a modiﬁcation of the relative abundance of the various
heavy-ﬂavour hadron species produced. The most striking effect is an enhancement of the baryon-to-
meson ratios for heavy-ﬂavour hadrons. First studies of these ratios [290, 292] indicated a signiﬁcant
change in the relative abundances of the heavy-ﬂavour hadron species, and in particular a ratio of Λc/D0
close to unity, which is nearly an order of magnitude larger than what predicted by the fragmentation
process implemented in the PYTHIA event generator. This value is also much larger than the prediction
of the statistical hadronisation model [295], in which the hadronisation occurs by recombination of an
equilibrated system of quarks and the hadron abundances are mainly determined by their masses. In
addition, hadronisation via coalescence in a strangeness-rich Quark-Gluon Plasma is predicted to lead
to a large enhancement in the production of strange heavy-ﬂavour hadrons, like Ds and Bs [296–298].
Hints of an enhancement of the Ds/D0 and Λc/D0 ratios in nucleus–nucleus collisions have recently
been reported by ALICE at the LHC [299, 300] and by STAR at RHIC [301].

The hadronisation by coalescence plus fragmentation also affects the pT distribution of heavy-
ﬂavour hadrons. For D mesons the effect can be roughly seen as a shift in pT of about 1.0–1.5 GeV/c in
the region of pT of 1.5–6 GeV/c, resulting in a signiﬁcant enhancement of RAA(pT). The degree of these
enhancements for D mesons, however, is signiﬁcantly different among the different implementations of
the hadronisation by coalescence and it is nearly unknown for heavy-ﬂavour baryons, like Λb and Λc.

Finally, the coalescence process leads to a signiﬁcant enhancement of the v2(pT) in the intermedi-
ate pT region that, for D mesons, amounts to about 20–40% depending on the speciﬁc modelling. The Λc
is expected to acquire instead a much larger enhancement of at least a factor of two for the v2. Therefore,
a combined measurement of the Λc/D and Λb/B ratios and of the baryon elliptic ﬂow would impose
strong constraints on the hadronisation mechanism and lead to a better determination of the diffusion
transport coefﬁcient of heavy quarks (see Section 5.4.3).

D mesons in the hadronic phase that characterises the late stages of the collision [297]. Both measure-

secondary vertex from the primary vertex is small. This limitation motivates studies for a further im-
provement of the ALICE inner tracker during LS3 [302]. A more precise measurement would open the
possibility to test in the charm sector some features at present only observed for the v2 of light-ﬂavour
hadrons: the mass scaling at low pT and the baryon–meson grouping at high pT.

Impact of hadronisation models on QGP characterisation

The hadronisation mechanism of heavy quarks is important for the description of the measured heavy-
ﬂavour RAA and v2 at RHIC and LHC energies. In particular, it has been recognized that recombination

play a dominant role in describing simultaneously both D meson RAA and v2 [280,303–305]. Moreover,
as discussed in Section 5.4.1, the charm baryon-to-meson ratio Λc/D0 measured at RHIC and LHC is
not consistent with a fragmentation only scenario [290,292]. Therefore, a combined study including also
the heavy baryon-to-meson ratio provides further information to solve the ambiguity on the recombina-
tion fraction. In the following, the sensitivity of the QGP characterisation to the recombination fractions
described in Section 5.4.1 is illustrated. To estimate how different model implementations of the hadro-
nisation mechanisms can affect the extraction of the charm quark diffusion coefﬁcient 2πT Ds, a global
quantitative χ2 analysis was carried out by comparing experimental data on the D meson RAA with
theoretical results obtained using the Fokker-Planck equation under a standard bulk medium evolving
hydrodynamically with η/s = 0.1 [306, 307]. The model developed in [273, 274] with diffusion and
drag coefﬁcients related by the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem was used, considering two different im-
plementations of the hadronisation process: one using only fragmentation of charm quarks to D mesons
(with the Peterson function) and another one including a hybrid hadronisation by coalescence plus frag-
mentation [280, 292]. For the estimate of the temperature dependence of 2πT Ds, a schematic model in
which the drag coefﬁcient is parametrized as γ = γ0(T /Tc)β was used. The two parameters γ0 and β
were determined by minimizing the χ2/n.d.f. of the model with respect to the measured D meson RAA.
The exercise could in principle be repeated using both RAA and v2. The spatial diffusion coefﬁcient
is directly related to the drag coefﬁcient by Ds = T /(M
γ(p = 0)), where M is the charm quark
mass. The left panel of Fig. 21 shows the spatial diffusion coefﬁcient 2πT Ds(T ) estimated from the ﬁt
to the present data with χ2/n.d.f < 2.5. The blue band corresponds to the fragmentation only results
and the red band to the coalescence plus fragmentation result. The right panel shows the same calcu-
lations obtained with experimental data with smaller error bars on the D-meson RAA as expected with
1. The comparison between the two cases highlights the difference in the estimation of the
Lint = 10 nb−
Ds coefﬁcient obtained with the two different hadronisation mechanism. Clearly, an optimal estimate of
the diffusion coefﬁcient requires an accurate description of the hadronisation mechanisms in the model.

5.5 Heavy-ﬂavour correlations and jets

5.5.1 Heavy-ﬂavour correlations

Although heavy quarks at the LHC energies are mostly produced in primary hard scatterings between the
incoming partons in hadronic collisions, a non negligible fraction of c and b quarks are originated from
processes of gluon splitting. At the leading order, cc pairs are produced with an azimuthal opening angle
of 180◦. At the next to leading order, gluon splitting and ﬂavour excitation processes can generate cc
pairs typically at small opening angles. The role of next-to-leading order production is currently poorly
understood even in proton-proton collisions [308,309] and introduces sizeable uncertainties in the models
for Pb–Pb collisions. As a result, heavy-ion calculations which use proton-proton generators as baseline
can be biased because of the different energy loss of quarks and gluons. Correlations between D and
D represent a promising way to study the relevance of these mechanisms in different kinematic ranges
of the charm quarks. In p–Pb collisions, the study of open heavy-ﬂavour correlations at forward and
backward rapidity provides information to test modiﬁcations of parton distribution functions in nuclei
(see Sect. 10.3.3).

Figure 22 shows the LHCb projections for the azimuthal DD correlations at forward rapidity in
pp and p–Pb collisions at the same collision energy per nucleon-nucleon-pair of 8.8 TeV. The ﬁgure
shows only statistical uncertainties (dominant with respect to the systematic uncertainties) as expected
with the Run 3 and 4 integrated luminosity. The measurement of the DD correlation can be performed
in intervals of D meson pT, providing differential information to test theoretical models with precision.
The experimental projections are compared with predictions obtained with EPOS3-HQ event generator
for two different kinematic selections in case of pPb collisions. In particular, the two selected pT ranges,
2-3 GeV/c and 3-12 GeV/c, yield to signiﬁcantly different correlation shapes in the calculation. This dy-
namic change of shape demonstrates the necessity to provide precise quantitative tests of the importance
of different production mechanism at the partonic level, the hadronisation and potential medium effects
in pp and in p–Pb collisions across different kinematic conﬁgurations.

In nucleus-nucleus collisions, DD correlations are sensitive observables to discriminate among
different mechanisms of in-medium energy loss of heavy-quarks, like radiative and collisional processes.
Such measurements, presently challenged by statistical limitations, will greatly beneﬁt from future high-
luminosity heavy-ions runs.

5.5.2 Heavy-ﬂavour jet measurements

Further insights into the mechanism of parton energy loss in the QGP can be provided by the study of
reconstructed heavy-ﬂavour jets. These measurements provide complementary information to the studies
of D and B mesons since they enable to better determine the energy of the initial heavy quark and give
access to the jet energy proﬁle. By comparing the production of heavy-ﬂavour jets with light jets one
can test the expected ﬂavour dependence of the in-medium energy loss in a wide transverse momentum
range and study the different energy loss mechanism of quarks and gluons. The study of more differential
observables related to the production of heavy-ﬂavour particles in jets, like the fragmentation function
and the angular correlations, provides additional constraints into the mechanisms of redistribution of the
energy lost by the parton inside the medium.

Figure 23 (left) shows the projections for the nuclear modiﬁcation factor of D0-meson tagged jets
in Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 5.02 TeV with ALICE. The measurement will provide a precise estima-
tion of the suppression of D0-tagged jets down to low pT, opening the way to study possible modiﬁcations
of charm fragmentation. Future measurements of the fragmentation functions of charmed hadrons in pp
collisions will also help to reduce the uncertainties on the charm fragmentation mechanisms, which are
currently among the main sources of uncertainties for theoretical calculations that describe heavy-quark
production at the LHC.

Figure 23 (right) shows the CMS projection for the distribution of D mesons as a function of the
distance from the jet axis for jets of pT > 60 GeV/c in Pb–Pb collisions divided by the distribution in
pp collisions. With the precision achievable with the high-luminosity data, one would be able to measure
precisely the effect of heavy-quark in-medium energy loss and the redistribution of the energy at large
angle with respect to the jet axis. This is expected to provide new constraints on in-medium energy
loss calculations. By comparing the ratio measured for D mesons with the one obtained for charged
particles, it will be possible to assess the relevance of medium response phenomena, which can induce
modiﬁcation of the jet shape at large angles and are expected to be less relevant for heavy quarks due to
their large masses.

Another area of research where the LHC experiments can make key contributions is the study of

shower in new kinematic regimes. A precise measurement of these observables at the LHC down to low
pT would also provide a unique opportunity to further investigate the dead cone effect [271], currently
not well understood and constrained.

5.6 Sensitivity to early magnetic ﬁelds and vorticity phenomena

Recently, it has been recognized that very strong electric and magnetic ﬁelds are created at early times
of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In Fig. 24 (left), the time dependence of the magnetic (By)
and electric (Ex) ﬁelds in Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV with impact parameter b=9.5 fm is
1. The space-time evolution is obtained
presented for a system with electric conductivity σel =0.023 fm−
as solution of the Maxwell’s equations as developed in [244]. The magnetic ﬁeld produced in non-central
heavy ion collisions is dominated by the By component which induces a current in the xz plane while
the time dependence of By generates an electric ﬁeld which is directed in the x direction. The combined
effect of both ﬁelds is a current in the xz plane.

The presence of early magnetic ﬁelds produced in heavy-ion collisions is expected to have an effect
on the charm directed ﬂow [257, 310], resulting in a v1 value larger than that of lighter particles (short
charm formation time and therefore sensitive to the maximum magnetic ﬁeld strength), and opposite for
particles with charm and anti-charm (due to the Lorentz force). Also the initial vorticity of non-central
collision is expected to affect the directed ﬂow observable. The STAR collaboration recently presented
the ﬁrst measurements of the directed ﬂow v1 coefﬁcient for mesons. This ﬁrst observation of non-zero
v1 for charm mesons, larger than that of lighter particles, is in qualitative agreement with theoretical
models including both electromagnetic and vorticity effects. The uncertainties on the difference between
the v1 of D0 and D0 from STAR are still too large to draw conclusions on the effects of the early magnetic
ﬁelds. The LHC Run 3 and 4 will enable more precise measurements on the charm directed ﬂow, which
will give additional insights into the initial vorticity of the Quark Gluon Plasma and the strength of the
electromagnetic ﬁelds. Figure 24 (right) shows the precision level for the difference of directed ﬂow
v1 for D0 and D0 which ALICE can measure as a function of pseudorapidity in semi-central Pb–Pb
collisions at √sNN = 5.5 TeV.

5.7 Heavy ﬂavour measurements in small colliding systems

Traditionally, proton-nucleus collisions were considered just as a benchmark to investigate Cold-Nuclear-
Matter (CNM) effects in the absence of a deconﬁned medium. As discussed in the devoted section, re-
cent results suggest to partially reconsider such a paradigm. In particular, the study of soft observables in
high-multiplicity p–Pb (and even pp) collisions led to the observation of signals traditionally attributed
to the formation of a hot deconﬁned medium: long-range azimuthal 2-particle correlations [311–314],
non-vanishing ﬂow harmonics [315, 316], increasing baryon/meson ratio as a function of pT [317], en-
hancement of strange-hadron production [318]. Many authors interpreted these observations as indica-
tions that the same strongly-interacting medium – with a collective hydrodynamic expansion driven by
pressure gradients – supposed to be formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions is also produced in smaller
systems. If the hydrodynamic scheme provides a consistent framework describing the above observa-
L) look
tions, its strong assumptions (e.g. a mean-free-path much smaller than the system size λmfp (cid:28)
challenging to satisfy for such small systems. Hence, some authors looked for alternative interpretation
of the data in terms, for instance, of initial-state effects (Color-Glass-Condensate [319]), of the formation
of a system with small parton-parton cross-sections [320], of the presence of anisotropic parton escape
mechanisms [321] or of quantum-mechanical interference in the presence of multiple sources of particle
production, entailing to reconsider the no-interaction baseline before looking for ﬁnal-state collective
effects [322] .

On the other hand, no signature of jet-quenching or suppression of high-pT particle production was

observed in high-multiplicity proton-nucleus collisions [323]. At ﬁrst glance this appears in contradiction
with the measurements involving soft observables. One should in any case consider that the quenching
of jets due to parton energy-loss in the QGP has a strong dependence on the thickness of the crossed
matter. On the contrary, if one accepts the hydrodynamic paradigm, the smaller size of the medium with
respect to the nucleus-nucleus case would lead to even larger pressure gradients and hence to a larger
acceleration of the ﬂuid, compensating its shorter lifetime.

In light of the above ﬁndings, as an independent probe, it is clearly of interest to address the study
of small systems also through heavy-ﬂavour observables. Due to their large mass c and b quarks are in
fact produced in the very ﬁrst instants in hard processes described by pQCD, at most affected by nu-
clear modiﬁcations of the Parton Distribution Functions (nPDFs) and by an initial transverse-momentum
broadening acquired in CNM. It looks then natural to extend transport calculations, developed to de-
scribe heavy-ﬂavour propagation through the plasma formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions, also to the
case of small systems, assuming as a working hypothesis that also in this case a hot deconﬁned medium
is formed. The theoretical modelling involves the same processes as in the heavy-ion case: the so-called
CNM effects (nPDFs and initial kT-broadening) modifying the hard QQ production, the propagation of
the heavy quarks throughout the ﬁreball and ﬁnally their hadronization in the presence of a hot medium.
The only difference is that, in the case of small systems, it is mandatory to include event-by-event ﬂuc-
tuations in the initial conditions.

In order to illustrate the level of precision which future experimental measurements must reach to
discriminate among different scenarios of initial and ﬁnal-state effects, various sets of predictions based
on the POWLANG model are reported in the following [324]. In Fig. 25 results of transport calculations
for the nuclear modiﬁcation factor of beauty hadrons in p–Pb collisions at √sNN = 5.02 TeV are
displayed and compared to experimental projections by CMS for the B-meson RpPb obtained from Run
2 data and projections of LHCb at lower transverse momentum for the B-meson RpPb [13] obtained using
as central points the calculations based on Ref. [325]. As can be seen, model predictions are sensitive
to the different choices of the transport coefﬁcients (see discussion in [324]) and of the initial conditions
(each nucleon-nucleon collision is assumed to deposit some entropy with a Gaussian smearing). In order
to answer the question about possible ﬁnal-state hot-medium effects, experimental measurements should

be extended to lower pT, as planned for the different experiments (see ALICE plans to perform beauty
measurements down to low pT in nucleus-nucleus collisions in Sec. 5.3.1). In fact, for pT larger than 10–
15 GeV/c the curves accounting for the transport and hadronization of the heavy quarks in a hot medium
(green curves) are very close to the (magenta) one which includes only the effect of the nPDF’s and of
the initial kT-broadening acquired in CNM, all of them being very close to unity as the experimental
projections by CMS. On the contrary, at lower pT the radial ﬂow of the beauty hadrons, acquired in part
during the propagation through the hot medium and in part at hadronization via recombination, leads to
a depletion of the spectrum at low pT and to an enhancement at intermediate pT which would allow one
to distinguish this scenario from the case of pure CNM effects.

As displayed in Fig. 26 the possible production of a hot deconﬁned medium in proton-nucleus
collisions would also leave its ﬁngerprints in the azimuthal distribution of the ﬁnal hadrons, leading
in particular to a non-vanishing elliptic-ﬂow coefﬁcient. Notice how one gets a positive v2 for charmed
2 GeV/c, in agreement with recent CMS data [326]. Differently from the
hadrons only starting from pT ≈
heavy-ion case, in such small systems it is important how the initial entropy deposition is modelled with
varying the smearing parameter (left panel). As displayed in the right panel of Fig. 26, within the frame-
work of the model, an important role is played by hadronization via recombination with light partons
from the ﬁreball, whose collective ﬂow enhances the azimuthal asymmetry of the charmed hadrons.

Introduction

The most direct way to measure the structure of matter is the controlled scattering of a beam of probe
particles. This approach was used to discover the atomic nucleus, and quarks and gluons, and it is em-
ployed today to explore the partonic structure of nucleons and nuclei. However, the partonic phase of
23 seconds before breaking up into its hadronic remnants, so that probing it by
the QGP lives for
the scattering of an externally-generated beam is impossible in practical terms. As an alternative, ener-
getic jets arising from high-Q2 processes in the same nuclear collision that generates the QGP provide
internally-generated probes that may be applied for this purpose [327–332].

10−

∼

Jets, observed as collimated sprays of energetic particles, were predicted by Quantum Chromo Dy-
namics (QCD) to form in high energy collisions. They constitute a substantial part of the background in
beyond the Standard Model physics searches and were instrumental in the Higgs boson discovery. While
jet evolution in vacuum is well understood, the question of how jets interact with a dense deconﬁned
medium remains an active ﬁeld of study, that is largely driven in the recent years by the unprecedented
experimental capabilities of the RHIC and LHC accelerators and detectors. Understanding from ﬁrst
principles how a jet evolves as a multi-partonic system, spanning a large range of scales (from
1 GeV
to
1 TeV) is crucial to quantitatively probe the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The successful description
of bulk observables by viscous hydrodynamic calculations with a small viscosity to entropy ratio have
led to the standard picture of a strongly coupled plasma. However, due to the property of asymptotic
freedom in QCD, the produced matter is expected to behave differently at smaller and smaller distances
which can only be accessed with well calibrated probes, namely, QCD jets.

High-Q2 processes between the partonic constituents of colliding nucleons occur early in the colli-
sion. Further interactions of the outgoing partons with the hot and dense QCD medium produced in heavy
ion collisions are expected to modify the angular and momentum distributions of ﬁnal-state jet fragments
relative to those in proton-proton collisions. This process, known as jet quenching, can be used to probe
the properties of the QGP [327–332]. Jet quenching was ﬁrst observed at RHIC, BNL [333–343] and
then at the CERN LHC [344–354] by studying the redistribution of energy radiated from the parton be-
cause of interactions with the QGP. More recent detailed analyses have focused on modiﬁcations to the
distribution of ﬁnal-state particles emitted in the parton’s shower [355–361].

One of the main goals of the RHIC and LHC heavy ion physics programs is utilization of jets
and their decay products, including high pT hadrons formed by light and heavy quarks, to investigate
the QGP properties. A milestone in this program is the extraction of the transport coefﬁcient ˆq by the
JET Collaboration [362], based on inclusive hadron suppression measurements at RHIC and the LHC.
However, this result has signiﬁcant systematic uncertainties, due both to theoretical issues and to the
limited view provided by inclusive hadron suppression measurements into the fundamental processes
underlying jet quenching. A more complete picture requires measurements of reconstructed jets and
their in-medium modiﬁcation.

At the LHC, the collision energy is over an order of magnitude larger than at RHIC. Jet production

65

cross-sections are correspondingly larger, enabling the study of hard processes over a wider kinematic
range. Detectors at both facilities have extensive capabilities to study fully-reconstructed jets by group-
ing the detected particles within a given angular region into a jet, thereby capturing a signiﬁcant fraction
of the parton shower. Jets are a key diagnostic of the QGP, as their interactions with this new state of
matter reveal its properties. The interaction with the medium can result in a broadening of the jet proﬁle
with respect to vacuum fragmentation. In this case, for a given jet size and a ﬁxed initial parton energy,
the energy of the jet reconstructed in heavy ion collisions will be smaller than in vacuum. In the case
where the gluons are radiated inside the cone, the jet is expected to have a softer fragmentation and a
modiﬁed density proﬁle compared to jets in vacuum. Jets may also scatter coherently in the medium,
and measurements of jet deﬂection may provide a direct probe of the micro-structure of the QGP. Fully
reconstructed jets provide better theoretical control than high pT hadrons because they are less sensi-
tive to non-perturbative physics and therefore have the potential to provide a better characterization of
the QGP. Furthermore, major theoretical and experimental advances were made recently in understand-
ing the evolution of parton showers in a QCD medium with the development of novel jet substructure
observables.

In the following sections the expected performance using a total integrated luminosity of 10 nb−
of Pb–Pb data, which is expected for HL-LHC, for a selection of key jet observables will be discussed.

where Njet and σjet are the jet yield in Pb–Pb collisions and the jet production cross-section in pp
collisions, respectively, both measured as a function of transverse momentum, pT, and rapidity, y, and
where Nevt is the total number of Pb–Pb collisions within a chosen centrality interval. Measurements
of the jet RAA at the LHC have shown a suppression of a factor of two in central collisions over a
wide range of jet transverse momentum [350, 351, 363]. Figure 28 shows the current precision obtained
1).
with 0.5 nb−
Especially at high transverse momentum a strong reduction of the experimental uncertainties is expected,
which will allow a detailed study of the momentum dependence of the out-of-cone radiation. The jet
RAA is sensitive to various physics mechanisms such as color coherence, ﬂavor dependence of energy
loss, and the medium response to the jet. Models incorporating these various physics effects can be
confronted with the high precision data from HL-LHC with a goal of determining what the relative
contribution of each of these phenomena is. The expected performance is compared with several recent
model predictions: the Linear Boltzmann Transport model (LBT) [364], three calculations using Soft
Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) [365–368], and the Effective Quenching model (EQ) [369]. The
higher precision data will allow tighter constraints on or falsiﬁcation of theoretical model predictions.
In addition to the inclusive jet RAA it is particularly interesting to study the mid- and forward rapidity
region separately since it allows to study the interplay between ﬂavor and spectral steepness, and the
path-length dependence of jet quenching. The right panel of Fig. 28 shows the improvement in statistical
precision in the forward rapidity region. The statistical precision should be sufﬁcient to quantitatively
assess the rapidity dependence of the RAA up to a rapidity of
= 2.8. Both of these predictions
indicate that HL-LHC should bring a deﬁnitive understanding of the intriguing features of the jet RAA
as seen in the current data.

Parton energy loss can be studied more differentially using boson tagged jets. The bosons (photons
or Z0 bosons) escape the region of the hot dense medium unmodiﬁed. This has been conﬁrmed through
the absence of signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of both photon and Z0 boson production rates in Pb–Pb collisions
relative to expectations from measured cross section in pp collisions by both ATLAS and CMS collab-
orations [370–373]. However, the partons recoiling from the boson is modiﬁed in heavy ion collisions
due to interactions with the QCD medium. Furthermore, jets produced opposite to the isolated boson are
more likely to originate from quarks, while dijet and hadron+jet correlations usually involve signiﬁcant
gluon contributions. Comparing Z+jet and γ+jet observables to dijets [349, 374] (or hadron+jets [354])
allows to explore the difference between energy loss for quark and gluon initiated jets. Figures 29 and 30
show the expected performance at the HL-LHC for the transverse momentum balance between the jet
and the boson. The central values are based on the smoothed data from the previous CMS publica-
tions [375, 376]. The systematic uncertainties are reduced by a factor of two with respect to the results
with the 2015 Pb–Pb data due to improvements on the jet energy scale and jet energy resolution uncer-
tainties available with the larger data sample at the HL-LHC. The collected number of γ+jet events will
also be sufﬁcient to study the path length dependence of jet quenching by performing measurements as a
function of angle with the reaction plane for the ﬁrst time. In addition to the smaller uncertainties due to
the enhanced statistics at the HL-LHC, it will also be possible to utilize higher momentum photons and
Z0 bosons allowing the measurement of larger jet energy losses. The LHC experiments also envision ex-
tending the jet momentum reach to lower transverse momentum in certain analyses, allowing to recover
those heavily quenched jets which are currently not selected for such measurements due to limitation
arising from the ﬂuctuating background. A distinct effect due to large backgrounds is that of limited jet
energy resolution, which can be improved by using more sophisticated techniques for the background
correction as was recently shown in Ref. [377].

6.3

Jet deﬂection

Angular deﬂection of the jet relative to its initial direction due to momentum transfer with the medium
can be used as a direct probe of the QGP. Jet deﬂection can be measured by coincidence observables, in
which an axis is determined by a hard reference object, and the deﬂection of the jet recoiling from hard
object is measured relative to that axis. Such scattering measurements, carried out over a wide range in
energy and resolution scale, can be used to explore the microscopic structure of the QGP. Modiﬁcation of
the rate of rare, large-angle jets with respect to the hard reference object in nuclear collisions compared
to the production rate in vacuum may arise from the scattering off quasi-particles (quarks and gluons or
composite objects) of the QGP, thereby probing their nature [378]. In addition, the recoil jet distribution

transport parameter ˆq by comparison to models [379].

Measurements of the angular distribution of jets relative to a reference axis have been reported for
either dijet, photon-jet, Z0-jet and hadron-jet coincidences, at RHIC [343] and LHC [349, 354, 375, 376,
380]. These current measurements exhibit no signiﬁcant evidence of in-medium modiﬁcation of angular
distributions, both at small and large angles to the reference axis. While they impose constraints on the
magnitude of in-medium scattering effects, their statistical precision is limited. Measurements during
HL-LHC will either discover in-medium modiﬁcation to the recoil jet angular distributions, or improve

There is an intensive ongoing effort to develop analysis tools and calculable approaches that dis-
criminate the various contributions to in-medium jet deﬂection and shower modiﬁcation, in both exper-
iment and theory [381] (see Sec. 6.2 and 6.4). In this section we focus solely on jet-centroid deﬂection
measurements, without consideration of the effects of shower broadening or other shower modiﬁcation
(see Sec. 6.4). Measurements of both classes of jet quenching observable must ultimately be interpretable
in a single consistent picture, but such an approach is beyond current experimental and theoretical capa-
bilities.

The most signiﬁcant background to the measurement of medium-induced jet deﬂection is broaden-
ing of the angular difference between the two leading jets due to well-established vacuum QCD effects, in
particular Sudakov radiation, which is radiation outside the jet cone that generates a broad peak in the re-
coil jet angular distribution relative to a reference axis (for example a high momentum hadron) [379,382].

Low-energy jet measurements are expected to experience larger deﬂection for a given momentum
transfer between the jet and medium [383, 384] and are therefore more likely to show large angle deﬂec-
tion. A recent calculation, that includes the effects of vacuum Sudakov radiation and jet-medium inter-
actions based on the few-hard (GLV) or multiple-soft (BDMPS) scattering approaches to jet quenching,
ﬁnds that the acoplanarity distributions for these different jet quenching pictures differ by a few per-
cent in the range 20 < pT,jet < 40 GeV/c [384]. This sets the precision required for the observation
of medium-induced jet deﬂection during HL-LHC. Additional theoretical considerations of in-medium
pT-broadening can be found in [330, 385].

In light of such considerations, it is necessary to utilize analysis techniques that can attain few
percent precision in the measurement of recoil jet angular distributions for low pT,jet and large jet radius
R, over the large and complex uncorrelated backgrounds in central Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC. This
precision is achievable using the statistical approach to jet background correction [343, 354, 375, 376], in
which the discrimination of correlated and uncorrelated recoil jet yield is carried out in a fully data-driven
way, at the level of ensemble-averaged distributions. The statistical correction approach has been used to
measure the azimuthal distribution for charged jets with R = 0.5 and 40 < pch
T,jet < 60 GeV/c recoiling
from a high-pT hadron in central Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC [354], and for charged jets with R = 0.5
and pch
10 GeV/c in central Au–Au collisions at RHIC [343], as well as for photon-jet and Z-jet
correlations [375, 376]. We expect that reaching as low as pT,jet = 10 GeV/c is likewise achievable at
the LHC, with good systematic precision.

The required experimental approach is therefore in hand, and we explore here the statistical pre-
cision achievable using it for such measurements during HL-LHC. We utilize the JEWEL event genera-
tor [386] for these projections, which incorporates medium-induced interactions of partons propagating
in the QGP. Calculations are carried out for central Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 5.02 TeV with integrated

ment in large-angle yield relative to the hemisphere average. The statistics of the measurement are clearly

a difference of only a few percent in these distributions for GLV-like and BDMPS-like in-medium scat-
tering, which is more difﬁcult to discriminate. The statistical error in the ratio in Fig. 32 is around 5% at

Jet internal structure

The ﬁrst measurements of jet quenching through full jet reconstruction at the LHC revolutionized our
understanding of parton energy loss in a hot and dense medium. Nevertheless, there remains a gap
in our understanding of the jet quenching mechanism that could be resolved by measuring the exact
properties of the parton evolution through the medium. High statistics of collected jets during HL-LHC
will provide a prime opportunity to explore the details of the internal structure of high energy jets that
undergo interactions with the QGP. Observables probing the internal structure of jets can be deﬁned
using all measured hadrons in a jet or by using subjet techniques selecting only a speciﬁc region of the
radiation phase space. In the following sections both approaches and their potential will be discussed.

6.4.1 Substructure with hadrons

Inclusive measurements of the longitudinal and transverse momentum distribution of hadrons in inclu-
sive jets have been performed with high accuracy at the LHC [387, 388]. The modiﬁcation due to jet
quenching is studied by comparing the results in pp and Pb–Pb collisions. For certain kinematic selec-
tions, for example at large z where the leading particle in the jet is carrying a large fraction of the total jet
momentum, the current experimental uncertainties are however large (see left panel of Fig. 33) limiting
the constraints on the jet quenching mechanism that can be extracted by comparing data to theoretical
models. The expected statistical precision at HL-LHC for the ratio of fragmentation functions in Pb–Pb
and pp collisions is shown in Fig. 33. This precision will allow detailed characterization of the excess in
yield of hard (large z) and soft (small z) fragments and the suppression in the region between these two
excesses providing strong constraints to theoretical models. Measurements of the rapidity dependence of
jet observables are of great interest since the fraction of quark- and gluon-initiated jets varies with rapid-
ity. However, current measurements of the fragmentation function are statistics limited and no signiﬁcant
rapidity dependence is observed [387]. The right panel of Fig. 33 shows the ratio of fragmentation func-
tions of high momentum jets for most central collisions with the expected accuracy at the HL-LHC. The

71

projection are compared to the hybrid model [389, 390] which implements energy loss according to the
strong coupling description of the radiation of low energy gluons associated with the hot QCD matter
which predicts a rapidity-dependent suppression of particle yield at high z.

When interpreting the modiﬁcation of inclusive jets one has to realize that by requiring a certain
jet momentum range a different sample of partons initiating the jet is selected in pp and Pb–Pb colli-
sions. Incorporation of this effect in model calculations introduces an additional uncertainty limiting the
constraints that can be put on a model. This can be overcome by using the rare process of jets recoiling
from photons. The expected performance of the radial pT proﬁle in jets recoiling from a high momentum
photon at HL-LHC is shown in Fig.34. The central values of the extrapolated spectra are obtained by
smoothing the results from [391] by a third order polynomial. The systematic uncertainties shown are
obtained by reducing by a factor of two those from the 2015 Pb–Pb data results, considering the expected
improvements on the jet energy scale and jet energy resolution uncertainties. The results show that the
photon-tagged jet shape could be measured with high precision providing insights about the modiﬁcation
of the jet transverse structure of quark initiated jets in the strongly interacting medium. Figure 35 shows
the expected statistical precision of the fragmentation function on photon-tagged events. The larger data
sample will enable the measurement for ﬁner centrality selections with respect to the current preliminary
results [392] allowing an exploration of the temperature and path length dependence of jet quenching.

6.4.2 Substructure with subjets

Early hard splittings in a parton shower may result in two partons with high transverse momentum that
are well separated in angle. Information about these leading partonic components can be obtained by
removing the softer wide-angle radiation contributions. This is done through the use of a jet grooming
algorithm called “soft drop”, an extension of the modiﬁed mass drop tagger (mMDT), that attempt to
split a single jet into two subjets, a process referred to as “declustering” [393–397]. For a parton shower
in vacuum, these subjets provide access to the properties of the ﬁrst splitting in the parton evolution [398,
399]. Figure 36 shows the expected performance for the momentum sharing fraction, zg [399], in the HL-
LHC phase. The central values of zg and jet mass are from previous CMS publications [360, 361]. The
systematic uncertainties are reduced by a factor of two with respect to the results with 2015 Pb–Pb data
due to the expected improvements on the jet energy scale and jet energy resolution uncertainties. While
the current data is not precise enough to constrain the medium properties further, the expected luminosity
at the HL-LHC will allow more detailed constraints as can be observed from the different results of the

mechanisms and scales relevant for jet quenching as is shown for the role of coherence in Fig. 36 in the
HT theoretical calculations [402]. A measurement of the groomed jet mass with the 2015 LHC Pb–Pb
data already showed that jet quenching might cause an increase of high mass jets [361]. Figure 37 shows
the expected performance for the groomed jet mass at HL-LHC which will allow measuring the high
mass region with higher precision.

6.4.3 Radiation phase space with Lund diagram

Recently, a theoretical representation of the radiation phase space within jets inspired by Lund dia-
grams [403] has been proposed [381] to study medium modiﬁcation of the radiation pattern. The so-
called Lund jet plane [404] - a portrayal of the internal structure of jets - was designed to build a concep-
tual connection between manually constructed observables and approaches that use Machine Learning
techniques to study QCD jets and/or discriminate between signal and background jets. The diagram is
constructed by mapping the available phase-space within a jet to a triangle in a two dimensional (log-
arithmic) plane that shows the transverse momentum and the angle of any given emission with respect
to its emitter. Such a triangular diagram, a representation of the radiation within any given jet, can be
created through repeated Cambridge/Aachen declustering.

To demonstrate the potential of future measurements at the LHC we constructed Lund diagrams
using the JEWEL Monte Carlo event generator [386]. To study the differences in the Lund diagram due
to medium effects the results are compared to a vacuum reference (jets produced in pp collisions). For
the simulations the JEWEL generator with the default settings is used without the optional calculation of
the so-called medium response retaining the partons / scattering centres that interacted with the jet was
not used (i.e. recoils off setting of the MC generator was used). The substructure of jets was analysed by
reclustering the constituents of the jet with the Cambridge/Aachen (C/A) algorithm as implemented in
the FASTJET package [405, 406] for two selections of jet pT 80–120 GeV/c and 200–250 GeV/c.

The Lund diagram density can be constructed experimentally and compared to analytic predictions
and parton-shower Monte-Carlo simulations, such as JEWEL. For this purpose a density map of points
(emissions) is deﬁned following formulations in [404]:

The effect of jet quenching on the Lund diagram is quantiﬁed by taking the difference between the
diagram with and without medium effects as shown in Fig. 39 for the two transverse momentum ranges
considered in this study. The average density integrated over ln κ calculated for Pb–Pb (MEDIUM) case
shows little deviation from the pp (VACUUM) reference. The most pronounced differences between

corresponds to an enhancement of soft (moderate ln 1/∆) and hard collinear splittings (large ln 1/∆).
These observations are consistent with soft and hard collinear splittings being modiﬁed by the medium.

As discussed in Ref. [381] speciﬁc regions in the Lund plane are sensitive to different type of
parton splittings. These regions can be identiﬁed by selecting the desired area using linear functions
ln κ = ln 1/∆ + ln 1

the selection, different formation times are probed and splittings will occur within or outside the medium.

Several arbitrary regions selected by the diagonal lines for constant
pTt are indicated in Fig. 38. To
illustrate the in-medium effects and their dependence on the jet momentum, the pT and the formation
(decoherence) time the density of the splittings can be projected along the momentum imbalance z =
pT,2/(pT,1 + pT,2). In the left panel of Fig. 41 we show the relative difference of the splitting density
¯ρvac)/¯ρvac for a selection of pTt. For small pTt the splitting density is suppressed for

the in-medium calculations whereas for large pTt the modiﬁcation is smaller. This is consistent with
the expectation that for large formation times the medium effects should be of smaller magnitude as
compared to splittings formed early. As the suppression seen in ∆ ¯ρ selected on pTt depends on the jet
pT we ﬁnd similar suppression for high- and low-pT jet selection for substantially different product of
the pT and formation time. In particular, for low momentum jets the modiﬁcations of ∆ ¯ρ for large pT t
is small. To further exploit the formula providing the approximate formation time dependence of the
splittings we select two regions of the Lund diagram: “late” t > 10 and “early” t < 10. The “early”
region should be dominated by splittings that form within the medium, whereas the “late” splittings are
t. In the right panel of

6.5 Opportunities for jet quenching studies with light-ion collisions

The ability of the LHC to collide ions lighter than Pb as discussed in section 2.4 provides an opportu-
nity to enhance the heavy-ion programme with a very large number of rare probes as summarized in
Sect. 11.1. Ar–Ar collisions are used as a test case for light ion running, although the optimal choice of
ion is still under study. It is clear that due to the larger integrated luminosity obtainable for a given heavy-
ion running period the number of jets produced in Ar–Ar collisions will be signiﬁcantly larger than in
Pb–Pb collisions. The question which will determine the value of the of light-ion running to the study
of jets and parton energy loss is to what extent jet suppression effects will be reduced in smaller systems.
To address this question, projections for Ar–Ar and Xe–Xe collisions at the LHC are considered using
the JEWEL Monte Carlo event generator [386].

The jet nuclear modiﬁcation factor RAA (discussed in Sect. 6.2) in Ar–Ar collisions is here com-
puted as the ratio of the jet transverse momentum spectrum in medium (Ar–Ar) over that in vacuum (pp)

explain the discrepancy. Alternatively, the discrepancy can be eliminated by reducing the temperature

mass within 70–110 GeV, a minimum pT of 10 GeV/c for its decay muons, and an associated jet with a

smaller systems, e.g. Xe–Xe. However, considering that central collisions are reproduced well by this
model and that allowing as an upper limit the suppression measured in the Pb–Pb 40–50% centrality
class, a signiﬁcant suppression is expected in central Ar–Ar collisions. The expected suppression com-
bined with the much larger nucleon–nucleon integrated luminosity (e.g. 8–25 larger with Ar–Ar than
with Pb–Pb collisions) makes lighter ion collisions at the LHC an attractive possibility for the study of
parton energy loss.

Introduction

A key objective in high-energy heavy-ion physics is to determine the in-medium forces that give rise to
the remarkable many-body features of the QGP. In the QCD vacuum, the unravelling of the fundamental
force between two static Color charges was made possible by the discovery of the charmonium and bot-
tomonium states in the 1970’s. Subsequent quantitative analyses of the bound-state spectra established a
phenomenological potential of the Cornell type [411],

with a colour-Coulomb term due to gluon exchange dominant at short distances, and a linear term with
string tension σ
0.9 GeV/fm to account for conﬁnement at large distance. This potential has also been
quantitatively conﬁrmed by lattice-QCD (lQCD) calculations [412, 413]. The corresponding effective
ﬁeld theory of QCD, potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD), allows for the deﬁnition of the static
potential [414] in a 1/mQ expansion for large heavy-quark mass, mQ [415,416]. The heavy-quark (HQ)
potential thus provides a well calibrated starting point to probe the QCD medium, and the in-medium
spectroscopy of quarkonia is the natural tool to carry this out in heavy-ion collisions, cf. [417–421] for
recent reviews. The string term in the HQ potential, eq. (26), characterises the long-range nonperturbative
part of the force and is associated with the conﬁning property of QCD. It is expected to play a critical
role in the transition from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom, and may be responsible for the
remarkable transport properties of the QGP, i.e., its strongly coupled nature, up to temperatures of 2-3
times the (pseudo-)critical temperature, Tc [422].

Much like in vacuum, a systematic investigation of the in-medium force must involve the spec-
troscopy of different states, as they subsequently dissolve with increasing temperature. The complexity
in describing the in-medium properties of quarkonia and their implementation into transport calculations
in heavy-ion collisions prevents their use as a straightforward thermometer of the medium produced
in these reactions. On the contrary, using information on the space-time and temperature evolution in
heavy-ion collisions from other sources (e.g.,, hydrodynamics and electromagnetic radiation), on can
utilize quarkonium observables to deduce their in-medium properties and infer the fundamental inter-
actions in QCD matter. In the vacuum, only the 1S ground-state bottomonia (Υ(1S) and ηb) are small
enough in size to be mostly bound by the colour-Coulomb force. All excited bottomonia and all charmo-
nia are predominantly bound by the nonperturbative string term (and/or residual mesonic forces). Thus,
charmonia and excited bottomonia are excellent probes of the in-medium conﬁning force, as originally
envisioned for the J/ψ [423]. However, in the cooling of the expanding ﬁreball, quarkonia can also be
“(re)generated” through recombination of individual heavy quarks and anti-quarks diffusing through the
medium. It is important to emphasise that quarkonium formation occurs also from quarks and antiquarks
from different initial pairs. This mechanism [424–426] has turned out to be critical in understanding the
rise of J/ψ production from RHIC to the LHC where (re)generation seems to constitute the major part
of the yield observed in central Pb–Pb collisions [427]. The data is also compatible with production
of J/ψ exclusively through statistical hadronisation at the crossover phase boundary [428]. Precise mea-
surements of the c¯c production cross section and the extraction of the charm-quark diffusion coefﬁcient
in Runs 3 & 4 will be important for making a more deﬁnite statement; these are key objectives discussed

81

in the chapter 5 on open heavy-ﬂavor production. Information from pT spectra and elliptic ﬂow will help
to complete the picture.

Regarding bottomonia, the current understanding suggests that (re)generation is less important for
Υ(1S), but possibly ﬁgures as a major component in the strongly suppressed yield of excited states [429,
430]. It is therefore of great importance to obtain additional information about the typical time at which
quarkonia are produced, in particular through pT spectra and elliptic ﬂow which contain information
about the ﬁreball collectivity imprinted on the quarkonia by the time of their decoupling. A schematic
illustration of the current knowledge extracted from in-medium quarkonium spectroscopy, i.e., their pro-
duction systematics in heavy-ion collisions is shown in Fig. 44.

Fig. 44: The vacuum heavy-quark potential as a function of Q ¯Q separation. The horizontal lines indi-
cate the approximate locations of the vacuum bound states while the vertical arrows indicate the minimal
screening distances of the media produced at the SPS, RHIC and LHC, as deduced from approximate ini-
tial temperatures reached in these collisions extracted from data (indicated above the arrows in MeV) and
from quarkonium production systematics in Pb–Pb and Au-Au collisions. Figure taken from Ref. [427].

On the theoretical side, the basic objects are the quarkonium spectral functions which encode
the information on the quarkonium binding energies, in-medium HQ masses and the (inelastic) reaction
rates. Ample constraints on the determination of the quarkonium spectral functions are available from
thermal lQCD, e.g., in terms of the heavy-quark free energy, euclidean and spatial quarkonium correlation
functions, and HQ susceptibilities, and are being implemented into potential model calculations [431–
437]. In particular, the role of dissociation reactions has received increasing attention. Early calculations
of gluo-dissociation [438, 439] or inelastic parton scattering [440] have been revisited and reformulated,
e.g., as a singlet-to-octet transition mechanism [434] or in terms of an imaginary part of a two-body
potential [441], respectively. In particular, the latter accounts for interference effects which reduce the
rate relative to “quasi-free” dissociation [440] in the limit of small binding; interference effects can also
be calculated diagrammatically [442]; they ensure that, in the limit of vanishing size, a Color-neutral Q ¯Q
dipole becomes “invisible” to the Color charges in the QGP.

The information from the spectral functions can then be utilised in heavy-ion phenomenology via
transport models. The latter provide the connection between ﬁrst-principles information from lQCD and
experiment that greatly beneﬁts the extraction of robust information on the in-medium QCD force and
its emergent transport properties, most notably the (chemical) equilibration rates of quarkonia. Thus far
most transport models are based on rate equations and/or semiclassical Boltzmann equations. In recent
years quantum transport approaches have been developed using, e.g., a Schrödinger-Langevin [443–446]

82

or density-matrix [447, 448] formulation. These will enable to test the classical approximation underly-
ing the Boltzmann and rate equation treatments and ultimately quantify the corrections. Quantum effects
may be particularly relevant at high pT in connection with the in-medium formation times of quarko-
nia, augmented by the Lorentz time dilation in the moving frame; schematic treatments of this effect
in semiclassical approaches suggest that varying formation times can leave observable differences for
high-momentum charmonia and bottomonia [429, 430, 449–451]. Finally, the implementation of phase-
space distributions of explicitly diffusing heavy quarks into quarkonium transport is being investigated
by various groups (see, e.g., Ref. [452]), which, as mentioned above, will provide valuable constraints on
the magnitude and pT dependence of (re)generation processes. In particular, the role of non-perturbative
effects in the HQ interactions in the QGP (which are believed to be essential to explain the large elliptic
ﬂow observed for D-mesons [260]) needs to be accounted for; the associated large scattering widths are
likely to require quarkonium transport implementations beyond semi-classical (or perturbative) approxi-
mations, which reiterates the need for a quantum treatment of recombination processes.

The larger experimental data samples in Runs 3 & 4, combined with improved detector perfor-
mance and measurement techniques, will allow one to signiﬁcantly improve over the current measure-
ments, with extended kinematic coverage (in pT) and allowing one to reach also currently-unobserved
quarkonium states, like Υ(3S). The complementarity (and overlap) of all 4 LHC experiments is crucial
in this endeavour and will call for a data combination strategy, for instance for Υ azimuthal anisotropy.

improvement of about 30% of the mass resolution of quarkonia for CMS [453]. The expected improve-
ment in the relative statistical uncertainty, due to a better signal over background ratio, is in the range

7.2 Charmonia in Pb–Pb collisions

A remarkable discovery at the LHC was that the suppression of J/ψ is signiﬁcantly reduced in compar-
ison to lower energies [454] and that this reduction is concentrated at lower pT [455, 456], compatible
with predictions of (re)generation at the phase boundary of QCD [424] or throughout the deconﬁned
phase [425, 457, 458], via recombination of diagonal (correlated pairs) or off-diagonal c¯c pairs [426].
No signiﬁcant difference is however found between measurements at √sNN = 2.76 TeV and √sNN =
5.02 TeV [456, 459]. Recently, the measurement of a signiﬁcant elliptic ﬂow coefﬁcient v2 both for D
mesons [460–462] and J/ψ [262, 463–466], which was shown to be correlated to the ﬂow of the bulk
particles [278, 466], can be seen as another indication for the thermalisation of charm quarks in the QGP.

The projected ALICE measurement of inclusive J/ψ v2 as a function of pT for the centrality class
20–40%, for 2.5 < y < 4, in comparison to model calculations [468] is shown in Fig. 45. Disentangling
the contributions of prompt and non-prompt J/ψ and considering (path-length dependent) energy loss
seems mandatory to understand the details of the J/ψ v2 pattern, which will be facilitated with the detector
upgrades and higher luminosity of Runs 3 & 4. The measurement of higher harmonics, e.g., v3, which
are sensitive to initial state energy density ﬂuctuations, will also become available and provide further
insight into the charmonium production mechanisms. Precise prompt and non-prompt J/ψ v2 and v3
measurements at low pT will be reachable using the ALICE central barrel. Polarisation will be measured
too [2], providing further insight in the different production mechanisms involved in Pb–Pb collisions as
compared to pp. Under the statistical hadronisation paradigm, the prompt J/ψ yield in Pb–Pb collisions
should be unpolarised with the 3 polarisation states equally populated.

At high pT, where a raising trend is currently hinted by Run 2 RAA measurements [459, 469],
the production mechanisms cannot currently be resolved, given the statistical limitation in the data (see
Fig. 46, left). The high pT reach of Runs 3 & 4 data (illustrated in Fig. 46 (right) for CMS) will allow one
to conclude on the important question of whether J/ψ formation at high pT is determined by the Debye
screening mechanism [451, 470], or by energy loss of the charm quark or the c¯c pair [471, 472].

The measurement of ψ(2S) mesons is more difﬁcult than that of J/ψ, because of a much smaller
production cross section times branching ratio and even larger suppression in Pb–Pb, yielding a very low
signal to background ratio. The projections for the measurement of the ψ(2S) state in ALICE are shown
in Fig. 47 as a function of centrality and compared to model predictions in the transport approach [468]
and from the statistical hadronisation model [428]. This (pT-integrated) measurement will signiﬁcantly
contribute to make a distinction between the two models. Projections are also available from the CMS
experiment [8]. Other states, for instance χc, may be measured too, albeit the measurement down to
pT = 0 will remain challenging. B+
c mesons can also be measured, either in the J/ψπ or J/ψµνµ channel,
to further study recombination in the beauty sector.

7.3 Bottomonia in Pb–Pb collisions

The study of bottomonia with Pb–Pb data from the Runs 3 & 4 of the LHC will bring further information
on the physics aspects described above. Although their production is a priori sensitive to the same effects
as charmonia, in practice the two quarkonium families feature some fundamental differences. Binding
energies differ, which is reﬂected in the different dissociation temperatures. Experimentally, compared
to charmonia, the absence of contribution from B meson decays and the more similar cross section times
branching ratio between the ground and excited states make bottomonia measurements easier. At the
same time, in pp collisions, up to 30–50% of the measured Υ(1S) and Υ(2S) yields actually result
from the feed-down from other states [258, 474]: a large portion of measured Υ(1S) suppression can
be due to the stronger suppression of the feed-down states – Υ(2S) and Υ(3S) mesons also receive
a signiﬁcant contribution from feed-down. The impact of (re)generation from uncorrelated b¯b is also
expected to be much smaller than for charmonia, because of the much smaller number of b¯b pairs per Pb–
Pb event compared to that of c¯c pairs. The importance of regeneration for bottomonia, from correlated
or uncorrelated pairs [446], is however still very model dependent, and no unambiguous experimental
signal for it has been found yet. Possible ways of constraining this contribution will be discussed in this
section.

Experimentally, the higher mass of bottomonia compared to charmonia implies higher pT decay
leptons, allowing the ATLAS and CMS experiments to measure the production down to zero transverse
momentum, as is possible for ALICE for both charmonia and bottomonia [475, 476]. The proximity in
mass between the different mass states, especially between the Υ(2S) and Υ(3S) states, also means that
good muon (or electron) momentum resolution is essential to their measurement, especially for excited
states.

It is useful to remind quickly the status in 2018, based on results from Run 1 and early Run 2 LHC
data as well as RHIC data. Υ production is found to be suppressed in Pb–Pb compared to expectations
from a scaling of incoherent pp collisions, in all rapidity, pT and centrality ranges measured [475–478].
Suppression is stronger in central events, as expected from the hotter and longer-lived medium in such
events. The results from the most central collisions suggest that a certain amount of suppression of the

directly produced Υ(1S) might be needed to explain the data in addition to cold nuclear matter effects and
melting of the excited Υ and χb states. The excited states Υ(2S) and Υ(3S) show higher suppression wrt
the ground state, with RAA values which respect the hierarchy expected based on their binding energies.
The Υ(3S) is still unobserved in Pb–Pb collisions (RAA(Υ(3S)) < 0.094 at 95% conﬁdence level, for
√sNN = 5.02 TeV [477, 479]). No signiﬁcant dependence of the suppression of Υ states is found at the
LHC on collision energy or rapidity.

Differences exist between models in the theoretical treatment of the suppression of the bottomonia
in the medium, as summarised earlier in Section. 7.1. Different assumptions are used regarding the
production mechanism, the heavy quark potential, or the evolution of the quarkonia with the medium.
The understanding of hot medium effects will be also improved thanks to higher precision measurements
in pp collisions of the feed-down fractions and to stronger constrains of the cold nuclear matter and initial
state effects (including nPDF or coherent energy loss effects [481]) from p–Pb collision measurements.

A precise measurement of the pT dependence of the Υ(1S) RAA will be possible using LHC data
from Runs 3 & 4. At low and medium pT, the measurement is sensitive to the possible regeneration
component in Υ meson production [429]. Projections for the expected precision of Υ measurements

two models [429, 430]. In the Kent state model calculations [430] (not shown), where Υ mesons are
originating only from the primordial production, with no regeneration component, the RAA is rather ﬂat
in the low and medium pT range. Only at higher pT (above 10–15 GeV/c) is a small rise predicted, which
can be looked for in Runs 3 & 4 data: as can be seen in Fig. 49, it is expected that a measurement up

In the TAMU model [429] however, a regeneration component is considered, and several assumptions
are explored, especially on the degree of thermalisation of the bottom quarks. It predicts a maximum in
the Υ(1S) RAA at a pT around 10 GeV/c. The current data is not precise enough to conﬁrm or disfavour

Coming back to the matter of regeneration, much can be learnt about it by a measurement of
the elliptic ﬂow of Υ(1S) mesons [482], unmeasured to date in any collision system. A parallel can
be drawn with that of J/ψ, which is still not properly described by models. This observable requires
a more detailed implementation of the dynamics of the interactions between the quarkonium and the
medium: thermalisation of the heavy quarks, time dependence of regeneration, path length dependence
of energy loss, as well as initial geometry ﬂuctuations and elastic rescattering of the quarkonia in the
medium. Thus, collective ﬂow brings complementary information to the RAA, and its measurement can
help disentangle some effects. In the case of Υ(1S) mesons, a small v2 (order of 1–2%) is expected [429,
483, 484], as can be seen in Fig. 51. The elliptic ﬂow of Υ(2S) could be signiﬁcantly higher [429,
484], both from the regenerated and primordial components. For both states, projections show that
experimental precision may not be enough for a signiﬁcant v2 measurement, assuming v2 values as
in Ref. [429]. For this reason, combining results between the different LHC experiments would be
beneﬁcial to reach a better sensitivity.

While we have focused on the RAA and v2 in this section, bottomonium production can be studied
using other observables. For instance, fully corrected yields or cross sections in Pb–Pb can be studied,
without making the ratio to a pp measurement in a RAA. Such a measurement, already reported in some
of the available experimental results [477], can directly be compared to production models.

7.4 Quarkonia in p–Pb and pp collisions

7.4.1 p–Pb collisions

Quarkonium-production studies in high-energy p–Pb collisions are usually carried out to measure how
much speciﬁc nuclear effects, those which do not result from the creation of a deconﬁned state of matter,
can alter the quarkonium yields. They should indeed be accounted for in the interpretation of Pb–
Pb results. They are also interesting on their own as they provide means to probe the modiﬁcation of
the gluon densities in the nuclei, the interaction between such pure heavy-quark bound states and light
hadrons, or phenomena such as the coherent medium-induced energy loss of these quark-antiquark pairs.
The measurements as a function of event activity brought several surprises, hotly discussed presently.

Usually, a separation into initial-state and ﬁnal-state effects is done (coherent energy loss effects

Yet, it is probably more instructive to
separate out the effects which are believed to impact all the states of the charmonium or the bottomonium
family with the same magnitude from those which are expected to impact differently the ground and the
excited states. In principle, initial-state effects (in particular gluon shadowing [325]) are of the ﬁrst kind
as the nature of the to-be-produced quarkonium state is not yet ﬁxed when the effects are at work. On
the contrary, ﬁnal-state effects (like regeneration [486]) do depend on the properties of the produced
quarkonium state and are thus be of the second kind.

However, in p–Pb collisions at LHC energies, ﬁnal-state interactions between the heavy-quark
pair and the nuclear matter likely occur before the pair hadronises. This is due to the large boost between
the nucleus and the pair – and thus the quarkonium. At rest, a c¯c or b¯b pair takes 0.3–0.4 fm/c to hadronise;
seen from the nucleus, at, for instance ylab
500 times longer. As
ybeam ∼
such, ﬁnal-state interactions with the compounds nucleus likely do not discriminate ground and excited
quarkonium states, unless rescattering in the nucleus affects the Q ¯Q wave function, overlapping with the
quarkonium wave function at large distance [487]. Such an argument based on the existence of a large
boost is nevertheless not applicable if one considers effects arising from the interactions between the pair
and other particles produced by the p–Pb collisions, not those contained in the Pb nucleus. The former
are indeed not moving at the Pb projectile rapidity. In fact, some of these particles can have similar
rapidities as the quarkonium and can thus be considered as comoving with it [488–490].

(cid:39)

The simultaneous study of open-heavy ﬂavoured hadrons along with both ground and excited
quarkonium states can shed light on all these phenomena. Along the lines exposed above, one expects
forward-quarkonium production in p–Pb collisions (namely when the quarkonia ﬂies in the direction
of the proton) to be sensitive to low-x phenomena (like the gluon shadowing or saturation in the lead
ion) and to the coherent energy loss. On the contrary, the backward production should be sensitive to
the gluon antishadowing and to fully coherent energy loss. Moreover, the scatterings of quarkonia with
comoving particles occur more often backward than forward, due to the rapidity-asymmetric particle
multiplicities, and more often as well with the larger and less tightly bound excited states.

−

With a wide rapidity coverage spanning from about

5 to 5, the LHC data from the 4 experi-
ments are unique as they allow one to probe much smaller x values than at RHIC and with a larger reach
in pT. The higher c.m.s. energy, the competitive luminosities and the resolution of the detectors also
allow for more extensive studies of the bottomonium family. In fact, an important observation made
with Run 1 data was that of a relative suppression in p–Pb collisions of the excited Υ(2S),Υ(3S) states
compared to that of the Υ(1S) observed by CMS [491] as a function of the event activity (recently con-
ﬁrmed by ATLAS [492], but also observed in pp collisions by CMS [493]). Not only was it unexpected,
but it constitutes a challenge to the conventional interpretation of suppression observed in Pb–Pb colli-
sions [477,479,494], which is of a signiﬁcantly larger magnitude, but of a similar pattern. Such a relative
suppression was also observed in the charmonium sector [495], where it is as well remarkable.

As far as the suppression of the Υ(1S) and J/ψ is concerned, they seem to follow the expectations
based on the RHIC results with a strong forward suppression described by shadowing – of a compatible
magnitude to that observed with HF data [325], or with the coherent energy loss mechanism [485].
More data, including that on Υ(nS) and Drell-Yan production, are clearly needed to disentangle both
effects [496] (see also Section 10.3.4). More precision for Υ(nS) and non-prompt J/ψ is in general
critically needed as the typical experimental uncertainties are still on the order of the expected effects.
As a case in point, backward y data are not yet precise enough to quantify the magnitude of the gluon
antishadowing, see Section 10 for the possible relevance of quarkonium p–Pb LHC data on nuclear
PDF ﬁts. Direct inclusion of this data in nPDF ﬁts is however not yet possible, pending unambiguous
clariﬁcation of the different effects impacting quarkonium production in p–Pb collisions.

Recently, the measurement of v2 of J/ψ in p–Pb collisions became available [497,498], indicating
(cid:46) 8 GeV/c. Recent transport model calculations [486],

centrality dependence of J/ψ and ψ(2S) production in p–Pb, cannot reach the high value of the v2
coefﬁcient seen in data [497,498] (see Fig. 52), suggesting that the observed v2 in p–Pb collisions might
also originate from initial state effects. A precision measurement in Runs 3 & 4 for a broad rapidity
range will clarify this.

In addition to conventional LHC collider data, one should not overlook the discriminating power of
data which can be collected in the ﬁxed-target mode [499, 500]. Not only they correspond to completely
1,
different energy and (c.m.s.) rapidity ranges, but extremely competitive luminosities, up to a few fb−
are easily reachable, beyond what can be reached in the collider mode during Runs 3 & 4. The LHCb
collaboration has paved the way for a full ﬁxed-target program at the LHC with their SMOG luminosity
monitor [501] used as an internal (He, Ne, Ar) gas target [502] (see also Section 11.4). It is now clear that
corresponding studies to those suggested above are possible [503] with the LHCb and ALICE detectors
with minor technical adjustments. They would drastically expand the scope of current proton-nucleus
quarkonium studies.

7.4.2 High-multiplicity pp collisions

Systematic studies of the quarkonium production in high-multiplicity pp events can play an important
role in understanding hadronisation.
In particular, the correlation of the quarkonium yields with the
charged-particle multiplicity can provide new insights into the interplay between hard and soft pro-
cesses in particle production. Hidden and open heavy-ﬂavour production measurements as a function
of the event activity were carried out at the LHC during Run 1 [491, 504]. The striking feature of the
data is that the production yields of quarkonia in high multiplicity events are signiﬁcantly enhanced
relative to minimum bias events, like for D mesons [505]. Speciﬁcally, the measurements of the self-
normalised yields (the yield divided by the mean yield in minimum bias collisions) as a function of
the self-normalised charged-particle multiplicity show an increase which is stronger than linear at the
highest multiplicities. The similarity between the D-meson and J/ψ results [504, 505] suggests that this
behaviour is most likely related to the production processes, and that hadronisation may only play a
secondary role. When comparing J/ψ preliminary results at √s = 13 TeV [506] to the ones previously
obtained at √s = 7 TeV [504], no signiﬁcant energy dependence is observed, i.e. the relative J/ψ yields
In addition, a dependence of the
for events with identical relative multiplicities give similar results.

pp collisions [491, 493].

The data are described both by initial-state models as well as by a model assuming hydrody-
namic evolution [507], considering that the energy density reached in pp collisions at LHC is high
enough to apply such evolution.
Initial-state (saturation) effects are considered within i) the Color-
Glass-Condensate (CGC) framework [508]; ii) the percolation approach [509, 510]; iii) a model with
higher Fock states [511], based on parameters derived from p–Pb collisions. The energy dependence
of the cross sections is controlled by the saturation momentum Qs(x) in the case of the CGC or density
of colour ropes ρs(y, pT ) in the percolation model, which also governs the charged-hadron multiplicity;
events at different energies with the same Qs or ρs are therefore identical. For a given event multiplicity,
they predict the relative yields to be almost energy independent. It seems that, in any case, multiple
interactions at the partonic level need to be taken into account in order to reproduce the data [512–514].

Runs 3 & 4 data, reaching unprecedented high multiplicities because of larger data samples, and
allowing for differential studies in pT, will certainly help discriminate models. For instance, in the
percolation model, where colour interactions produce a reduction of the charged-particle multiplicities,
the deviation from the linear behaviour is expected to be steeper for high-pT quarkonia (and D mesons).
Moreover, measurements of J/ψ yields relative to those of D mesons with the same transverse mass could
help elucidate the relative contribution of hadronisation and initial-state effects.

Studies of double differential ratios of excited-to-ground quarkonium states versus relative mul-
tiplicity could help clarify the presence of ﬁnal-state effects, either QGP-like or the ones proposed by
the comover model [515, 516]. Also, within the CGC+NRQCD framework [508], the relative contribu-
tions of the 4 leading J/ψ Fock states have been calculated as a function of the event activity, showing a
different dependence for different Fock states.

The strongly interacting system formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions emits electromag-
netic radiation that can be detected using different probes: real direct photons or virtual photons mea-
surable via dilepton pairs. Direct photons can be split into prompt photons, emitted by the partons of
colliding nuclei during their inter-penetration, and thermal photons, emitted by the almost thermalized
hot system. For dileptons these contributions are called Drell-Yan and thermal, respectively. In contrast
to real photons, dileptons carry a mass and thus can be used to study the decay of massive particles, such
as the in-medium modiﬁed spectral shape of vector mesons, the ρ meson being the most prominent one,
and the search for particles beyond the Standard Model, e.g., dark photons. In this section, we outline the
measurement of photons via calorimetry and the so-called photon conversion method, as well as dielec-
tron (e+e−), and dimuon (µ+µ−) pairs in A–A collisions in the ALICE detector at the LHC. Moreover,
the photoproduction of dilepton pairs in peripheral collisions and the expected sensitivity for the search
of dark photons are discussed in subsections 8.2 and 8.3, respectively. We begin with a short review
of previous experimental results together with a summary of the basic theoretical models employed to
describe these data.

8.1 Thermal radiation and in-medium spectral function

Electromagnetic radiation from the hot and dense system formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions
in the form of real photons was measured for the ﬁrst time at the SPS by WA98 [517]. The direct photon
spectrum measured in Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 17.3 GeV showed an excess above the extrapolated
prompt photon signal based on measurements in proton induced reactions. The excess is described by
a large variety of hydrodynamic and cascade models (see [518] for review), most of which assume the
formation of a QGP phase. Also at the SPS, a modiﬁcation of low-mass dilepton pairs in S–Au and Pb–
Au collisions relative to the expectation of in-vacuum hadron decays was observed by CERES [519–523]
and studied with high precision by NA60 in In–In collisions [524–527]. The data are consistent with an
in-medium ρ spectral function that, driven by the coupling to baryons, melts and approaches the one
from qq annihilation in the vicinity of the phase transition [528–530], which is compatible with chiral
symmetry restoration [136, 531]. On the other hand, the data cannot be described with a dropping mass
scenario, in which the ρ mass drops to zero as chiral symmetry is restored [532]. Beyond the issue
of chiral symmetry restoration, NA60 measured an excess of prompt dimuons in the intermediate mass
region between the φ and the J/ψ masses [525, 526]. Contrary to transverse-mass spectra of the dimuon
continuum at lower masses, this excess shows no increase of the exponential inverse slope with mass,
i.e., blue shift, that is typical for radial ﬂow. This suggests that the source of this enhancement is from the
earliest phase of the collision, before signiﬁcant radial ﬂow has built up. This supports the idea that the
inverse slope of the invariant mass spectrum is insensitive to the expansion of the medium and therefore
a true measure of the average temperature. NA60 measured a value of T = 205
12 MeV [527], which
signiﬁcantly exceeds the temperature of 154
9 MeV, above which the formation of a QGP has been
predicted [50, 135].

At RHIC energies, PHENIX and STAR have measured an enhancement of e+e− pairs in the low
mass region in Au–Au collisions [533–536] that can be described with the same model of collisional
broadening as used at the SPS. STAR measured that the enhancement above the hadron decay back-

92

ground does not change with collision energy between √sNN = 19 and 200 GeV [536]. Despite a
marked decrease of the net-baryon chemical potential in this energy range, the total baryon plus anti-
baryon density does not change much, providing further evidence that the ρ coupling to baryons and
antibaryons is responsible for the enhancement. Real direct photon production in Au–Au collisions was
measured by PHENIX [537–539]. An excess was observed compared to binary scaled direct photon
production in pp collisions. The signal was measured via quasi-real virtual photons, i.e., e+e− pairs
with small invariant mass, as well as real photons converting in detector material. The excess yield at
low pT appears to have a universal multiplicity dependence, scaling with the charged-particle multiplic-
ity at midrapidity to the power of about 1.25, independent of collision energy between √sNN = 39 and
200 GeV [539]. The transverse momentum spectrum of the excess yield has an exponential inverse slope
19 (syst.) MeV for central collisions and values close to that for other cen-
of T = 221
tralities. The spectrum, however, is strongly blue shifted by radial ﬂow in the later stages of the ﬁreball
radiation, which is further supported by a sizeable elliptic ﬂow (v2) of the direct photon signal [540].
Therefore, the inverse slope cannot directly be interpreted as an average temperature, which highlights
the importance of thermal dilepton measurements as a function of invariant mass. However, the mod-
elling of the space-time evolution offers the possibility of extracting temperature information from the
photon data [541]. The direct photon v2 is indeed comparable to the v2 of pions, which suggests late
emission of direct photons dominated by the hadronic phase [542]. A simultaneous description of the
elliptic ﬂow effect, as well as the large direct photon excess, which implies early production, poses a
signiﬁcant challenge to theoretical models.

The ﬁrst measurement of direct photon production in Pb–Pb collisions with the ALICE detec-
tor [543] at the LHC also show an excess of thermal production at low pT < 3 GeV/c with respect to the
prompt direct photon expectation [544]. The extracted effective temperatures T = 297
±
41 (syst.) MeV in central collisions and T = 410
140 (syst.) MeV in semi-central
collisions are higher than those at RHIC energies, as expected. The direct photon elliptic ﬂow was also
extracted in central and semi-central collisions [545]. The measured ﬂow is close to the one at RHIC
energy and at low pT < 4 GeV/c to the one of ﬁnal hadrons. However, this measurement does not cause
the same challenges to models, since the experimental uncertainties are still large at this point. The re-
duction of systematic uncertainties of the direct photon measurement is the main objective for Run 3 to
improve its signiﬁcance. Moreover, a low magnetic ﬁeld run will allow one to access the pT < 1 GeV/c
region where the thermal photon production increases rapidly. Theoretical calculations of thermal and
prompt photon productions are available at √sNN = 5.02 TeV (Fig. 53) [209, 546–548]. The thermal
contribution dominant at low pT is given by the QGP photon emission rates and the hadronic photon
production rates, integrated over the space-time evolution of the system. In [209] a (2+1)D hydrody-
namic evolution with IP-Glasma initial conditions with initial ﬂow and ﬁnite shear and bulk viscosity
is followed by a hadronic phase modelled using UrQMD. A longitudinal boost invariant (2+1)D ideal
hydrodynamics is used in [547], while in [548] a (2+1)D ideal hydrodynamic model including non-
vanishing initial ﬂow is employed. The prompt photon component, dominant at high pT, is very similar
in all models. It is obtained from NLO pQCD calculations using the BFG-II photon fragmentation func-
tion and the CTEQ6.6 [547] or nCTEQ15 parton distribution function [546]. An increase by a factor
∼
1 GeV/c and by a factor 1.5 to 2 for the prompt photons is predicted compared to
1.5 at about pT ≈
yields at √sNN = 2.76 TeV. The predicted thermal photon elliptic ﬂow parameters for central collisions
are close to each other at the two LHC energies and are very small. Differences become larger as one
goes towards peripheral collisions. Simultaneous measurements of photon yields and photon ﬂow with
high accuracy and lower pT reach will provide constraints to theoretical models.

Dilepton measurements by ALICE at the LHC are not yet sensitive to possible low-mass enhance-
ment and thermal signals [551]. A precise measurement of the low-mass dielectron continuum will be
one of the main objectives of the ALICE physics programme during the LHC Run 3 and 4. In the mean-
while, the dominant background of dielectrons from correlated semileptonic open heavy-ﬂavour decays

The model by R. Rapp et al., an approach that has been proven to provide a quantitative description
of the existing dilepton results [554], is based on two ingredients that are put into a realistic space-
time evolution [555]. The thermal dilepton radiation is modelled by emission rates from the hadronic
phase and the Quark–Gluon Plasma [530, 556]. A hadronic many-body approach [529] is used for the
medium-modiﬁed spectral functions of ρ and ω mesons. In addition, the equation of state is updated to a
cross-over transition around Tc = 170 MeV extracted from with recent lattice QCD computations, and
hadro-chemical freezeout at Tchem = 160 MeV [557]. Figure 54 (left) shows the calculations performed

A complementary approach to study dilepton spectra and thermal radiation is provided by the
parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which also successfully describes the exist-
ing experimental data [558, 559]. The in-medium modiﬁcation of the ρ meson is incorporated in PHSD
by an off-shell transport of vector mesons with a dynamically changing set of spectral functions [560]
evolving towards the vacuum spectral function at the end of the collision history. The electromagnetic ra-
e+e−q(q) using effective
diation of the QGP is modelled by qq
propagators for quarks and gluons from a dynamical quasi-particle model [561]. Figure 54 (right) shows
both contributions to the dielectron spectrum in central Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 5.5 TeV calculated
from PHSD together with other sources of dielectrons: decays of long-lived light mesons into e+e− (the
so-called hadronic cocktail) and the semileptonic decay of hadrons containing heavy quarks, such as D
and B mesons.

Important input for models aiming to describe the dilepton yield at LHC energies are the in-
medium spectral functions for the vector mesons, most importantly the ρ meson, as well as the photon and
dilepton rates from the QGP. For the latter, Lattice QCD calculations, which are currently limited to the
quenched approximation, will hopefully be extended (e.g., larger lattices, especially in the time direction,
or facilitating extrapolations to the continuum limit) and be available at higher accuracy for realistic
systems including light dynamical degrees of freedom in the future. Recent updates on calculations of
the photon rate [562], the electrical conductivity [563], and dilepton rates [564] are promising. The
photons and dilepton rates from Lattice calculations should in the future be combined with dynamical
models like those in Fig. 54, thus improving their results. In addition, the in-medium spectral functions
could also use direct input from Lattice QCD [565, 566] or from a functional renormalization group
approach [567]. These models can further be reﬁned by including the effects of dissipation, and in that
case the electrical conductivity will become of interest to both the dynamical evolution of the medium as
well as the electromagnetic rates. In order for that to be achieved self-consistently, the evolution of the
medium and the electromagnetic rates need to be modiﬁed to account for dissipative effects, which is a
currently ongoing effort [209, 568, 569].

More differential information can be used to study the equation of state of the system throughout
the full collision history. The measurement of the elliptic ﬂow coefﬁcient v2 of thermal photons and
dileptons, especially if combined with results from hadronic channels, should put tighter constraints on
fundamental properties of the medium (e.g., transport coefﬁcients), as well as its "initial conditions"
or "pre-equilibrium" dynamics [570]. For example, owing to the penetrating nature of dileptons, the
invariant mass dependence of the dilepton v2 is sensitive to the temperature dependence of both shear
[569] and bulk viscosity [568] in a way that is difﬁcult to access using hadronic observables alone.

8.1.1 Real photons

ALICE has measured direct photon spectra in three centrality classes in Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN =
2.76 TeV [544]. An excess of direct photons was quantiﬁed by the pT dependent double ratio

where γ incl is the measured inclusive photon spectrum, π
param a parametrization of the measured π
spectrum, and γ decay the calculated decay photon spectrum. The double ratio has the advantage that
some of the largest systematic uncertainties cancel partially or completely. The measurement combines
results of the Photon Conversion Method (PCM) and of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), see Fig. 55,
left. In central collisions at low pT < 4 GeV/c an excess with respect to prompt photon predictions is
observed that is attributed to thermal photon emission from the QGP. In the 20% most central collisions

the low pT excess is of the order of 10–15%, while the total uncertainty of the order of 6%. A signal of
direct photons is found in central collisions, but on the level of
2σ, while in mid-central and especially
in peripheral the signiﬁcance is even smaller. On the other hand, peripheral collisions are important since
there one can estimate and restrict the contribution from prompt direct photons.

For Run 3 the PCM measurement will be inﬂuenced by the ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS)
and Time Projection Chamber (TPC) upgrades, while PHOS and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EM-
Cal) will be kept unchanged. The new ITS shows an improved low pT tracking efﬁciency, that will
partially compensate the efﬁciency loss due to the
30% reduction of its material thickness. Two 1 mm
∼
tungsten wires with well known thickness will be installed parallel to the beam direction for precise cal-
ibration of the material thickness as described later. The TPC continuous readout mode together with
large pile-up may prevent the use of photon conversions beyond a radius of 35 cm. This restriction will
translate into a
35% lower photon efﬁciency. On the other hand, the PCM measurement will also
proﬁt from the dedicated heavy-ion run with reduced magnetic ﬁeld of the ALICE solenoid, which will
considerably increase the low pT reconstruction efﬁciency. To estimate how one can improve the accu-
racy of the measurement, the uncertainties are split into three classes: those which can be improved with
0 ratio);
increase of statistics (statistical uncertainties, uncertainties related to π
uncertainties which can be reduced using new techniques and some special methods (material budget es-
0 methods); and
timate - with calibrated material analysis, energy scale in calorimeters with new hybrid π
uncertainties related to the properties of the detector which can not be improved (hadron contamination
in calorimeters, electron identiﬁcation in conversion method etc.). To estimate the improvement of the
1 per Pb–Pb run and
uncertainties it is assumed that the integrated luminosity will reach Lint = 3.1 nb−
1 at the end of Run 4, which is more than a factor of 100 larger the than integrated
in total Lint = 13 nb−
1 used in the published analysis [544]. The major improvement foreseen for
luminosity Lint = 10 µb−
Run 3 is the use of calibrated tungsten wires inserted into the ITS to determine the product of the pho-
ton ﬂux times the γ reconstruction efﬁciency. This product would then be used to precisely determine
the material thickness in the rest of the ITS (assuming ϕ-independent photon ﬂux and taking the radial
dependence of the reconstruction efﬁciency from simulation). The proposed calibration method is based

of 1% on the ITS thickness is taken. The uncorrelated systematic uncertainties on the π
ments will be reduced by a factor 10 due to the increased luminosity as they are deﬁned mostly by the
raw yield extraction uncertainties which scale proportional to statistical uncertainties. The systematic
uncertainties on the photon selection and particle identiﬁcation are expected to be reduced by 50%. Fig-

the measured values of Rγ are kept but the uncertainties are recalculated. The total errors are reduced by

exploration of the 0–1% centrality range.

The ALICE Collaboration carried out measurements of the direct photon elliptic ﬂow [545] in
Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV for the two centrality classes, 0–20% and 20–40%, see Fig. 56,

is compared to the esti-
mated decay photon elliptic ﬂow vγ ,dec

systematically higher than theoretical predictions of hydrodynamic [571, 572] and the transport [573]
models. However, because of the large uncertainties one can not presently exclude either of theoretical
calculations. Using the same assumption concerning photon and neutral measurements in Run 3 as for

8.1.2 Dileptons

The sensitivity to the expected signal of thermal radiation and an in-medium modiﬁcation of the ρ spec-
tral function in the dielectron and dimuon channels with the ALICE detector [86,543] was studied already
in preparation for ITS upgrade in 2019/20 [2, 3, 68, 473]. The measurement of low-mass dileptons after
this upgrade will proﬁt from

– an improved vertex resolution, which leads to a better separation of electrons from prompt sources,
like thermal radiation, and electrons from the decays of heavy-ﬂavour hadrons, for which cτ is
about 150 µm (open-charm hadrons) or 400 µm (open-beauty hadrons),

– a reduced material budget and improved tracking efﬁciency at low transverse momentum pT,
which leads to a smaller background of electrons and positrons from photon conversion in the
detector material,

– the installation of the muon forward tracker, that will lead to an improved mass resolution and

reduced background in the dimuon channel,

– and a higher rate capability (50 kHz in Pb–Pb collisions) that will increase the expected number
of events in the central barrel detector by a factor of 100. The increased rate capability also enables
the possibility to record in a single Pb–Pb run a large data sample with reduced magnetic ﬁeld
value in the ALICE central barrel (B = 0.2 T instead of 0.5 T), which increases the phase-space
acceptance and the reconstruction efﬁciency of low momentum electrons and positrons.

The expected measured spectra discussed in this section closely follow the strategy that is discussed in
more detail in [2, 3, 68, 473].

For the dielectron channel an integrated luminosity Lint ≈

1 is assumed, which should be
collected in the dedicated Pb–Pb run at low ﬁeld. The corresponding number of events in central (0–
10%) collisions is 2.5

109. The input for the signal is composed of:

3 nb−

×

– contributions from the decays of long-lived light pseudoscalar and vector mesons (hadronic cock-
0,η,η’,ω, and φ), with particle ratios and spectral shapes extrapolated from

tail consisting of π
existing heavy-ion data at lower energies,

– correlated semileptonic charm decays based on calculations from the PYTHIA event generator

[574],

– and the radiation of thermal dileptons and a medium-modiﬁed spectral function for the ρ meson in

a realistic space-time evolution (see Fig. 54 (left)).

With respect to earlier calculations [2, 3, 68] a fast simulation of central Pb–Pb collisions is used here
to estimate the combinatorial background and the statistical signiﬁcance of the signal. The particles
are produced with the event generator HIJING [575] and then propagated through the detector material
by GEANT3 [576]. An updated geometry of the ITS is utilised in the detector description and leads
to a more realistic treatment of conversion electrons and the subsequent background. Electrons are
reconstructed and identiﬁed via signals in the ALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and Time-Of-
Flight (TOF) detector, a parametrised efﬁciency from runs at low magnetic ﬁeld during LHC Run 2
is applied. After pairing electrons and positrons an additional selection on the pair distance of closest
approach

is applied to reduce the contribution from correlated semileptonic charm decays. The selection is chosen

signal distribution S, which includes the remaining charm and beauty hadron decays, is obtained by
subtraction of the combinatorial background from all e+e− pairs. The combinatorial background B is
estimated from like-sign pairs and a correction factor R that takes into account the different acceptance of
the apparatus for unlike- and like-sign pairs [551–553]. The signiﬁcance that is used to project the statis-
tical uncertainty on the measurement is calculated as S/√S + 2B. The signal S is shown in Fig. 57 (left)
together with all input distributions. In order to extract the QGP component and the in-medium modiﬁed
ρ spectral function, the hadronic cocktail and the contribution from correlated semileptonic charm decays
is subtracted and shown in Fig. 58 (left). In addition, the systematic uncertainties from the combinato-
rial background and signal extraction, as well as physical backgrounds after subtraction are shown. The
relative systematic uncertainty of the signal, from tracking, track matching, and particle identiﬁcation, is
assumed to be 10%. For the systematic uncertainty of B a mass independent uncertainty of the R factor
of 0.02% is used. Relative systematic uncertainties from the light-hadron cocktail and the total charm
cross section of 10% and 15%, respectively, are applied.

10nb−

In the dimuon channel, the integrated luminosity of Pb–Pb collisions (Lint ≈

1) is used. In
this channel, the main source of background is represented by the combinatorial pairs of muons coming
from uncorrelated semimuonic decays of light-ﬂavoured mesons, mainly pions and kaons, copiously
produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. The opposite-sign dimuon mass spectrum obtained after the
subtraction of the combinatorial background evaluated by means of an event mixing technique, results
from the superposition of several opposite-sign correlated dimuon sources, represented in the right panel
of Fig. 57. In order to isolate the thermal dimuon radiation and the in-medium modiﬁed line shapes
of the ρ meson, the known and well-identiﬁable sources of the hadronic cocktail — 2-body and Dalitz
decays of the η, ω, φ mesons, for which no in-medium effect is expected — are subtracted from the
total opposite-sign correlated dimuon mass spectrum. A 10% systematic uncertainty in the evaluation of
the shape and the normalization of these sources has been considered in the performance studies. The
same procedure has been also applied for the subtraction of the dimuons from the open charm and open
beauty processes; alternatively, these two sources could be separated from the prompt ones by means of
an analysis based on the discrimination of the dimuon offset at the primary vertex.

for the analysis of the intermediate mass region (the cuts considered in the right panel of Fig. 58 being
optimized for the signal extraction in the mass region below

An alternative method to separate the thermal component from the modiﬁed heavy-ﬂavour pro-
duction in the intermediate mass range, is to ﬁt the measured DCAee distribution as a function of the
dielectron invariant mass and pair transverse momentum with a three component function, including the
contributions from prompt dielectron sources, from open-charm hadron decays and from open-beauty
hadron decays. Since the shape of the heavy-ﬂavour DCAee spectra is quasi model independent, the
dielectron yield of open heavy-ﬂavour decays in the ALICE acceptance can be determined from the data
with small uncertainties, without relying on theoretical calculations. Such ﬁts were performed already
with the Run 1 data in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV [552]. Nevertheless, the statistics available did not
allow for a differential study.

The measurement of the dielectron elliptic ﬂow coefﬁcient v2 as a function of Mee in peripheral
Pb–Pb collisions (40–60%) was studied already in [2]. It was shown that an absolute statistical uncer-
0.01 can be achieved. Such uncertainties present a very encouraging prospect for
tainty on v2 of σv2 ≈
dilepton studies since temperature dependent shear viscosity [569], bulk viscosity [568, 577], and early
stages of reaction dynamics [570] have effects on the order of a few up to tens of percent on dilepton v2,
and thus future constraints on these properties will greatly beneﬁt from a statistically improved dilepton
v2 measurement.

Heavy ions carry strong electromagnetic ﬁelds. Their electric and magnetic ﬁelds are perpendicular, so
may be treated as a ﬂux of nearly-real photons [578]. These photon ﬁelds can give rise to photonuclear
(photon on nucleus) and two-photon interactions. Although these interactions are expected to occur in
both ultra-peripheral (UPC) and more central collisions, they were not generally expected to be visible in
non-UPC collisions. The few ﬁnal state particles from the photon-mediated interactions were expected
to be swamped by the more copious hadronically produced particles. That expectation changed recently,
when ALICE [579] and then STAR [580,581] and ATLAS [582] observed excesses of dileptons produced
at very small pair pT, pT < 100 MeV/c. These pairs were prominent in Pb–Pb and Au–Au collisions,
but not in pp interactions; the excess corresponded to RAA > 5. This is inconsistent with all expectations
for hadroproduction, but consistent with photoproduction, where the pair pT scale is set by the nuclear
(cid:126)/RA. The kinematics of these pairs may be affected by the medium in which they
radius RA, with pT ≈
are produced or propagate, so they may probe the evolving Quark–Gluon Plasma or associated magnetic
ﬁelds.

UPC photon-mediated interactions have been studied at both RHIC and the LHC [578, 583–586].
The agreement between data and calculations is quite good. Photoproduction of ρ, ω, ρ’ , J/ψ, J/ψ’,
Υ and direct π+ π− pairs has been observed, along with two-photon production of dilepton pairs and
light-by-light scattering. In peripheral collisions, photon-mediated interactions might be used to probe
the nuclear medium that they may occur in, including the QGP [580, 582]. The produced leptons may
interact with this medium, leading to alterations in their momentum.

Peripheral collisions introduce several new considerations for photon-mediated reactions, partic-
ularly evolving coherence conditions for both photon emission and coherent photon-nucleus scattering.
Photon emission in both γ γ and photonuclear interactions is expected to be completely coherent, gov-
erned by the nuclear form factor F (q) [587]. The photon emission from a nucleus moving with Lorentz
boost γ should occur before the hadronic interaction (which is taken to occur at t = 0), at a retarded time,
is the transverse distance from the photon emission point to where it
t
interacts. For very small impact parameters, some coherence may be lost, and a more detailed calculation
is needed. For photon-nucleus collisions, the situation is more complicated, and will be discussed below.

Here, two-photon interactions and coherent photonuclear interactions are discussed.

8.2.1 Two-photon interactions

In two-photon interactions, each nucleus emits a photon, which then interact and form a lepton pair. In
UPCs, this process is well described by the Weizsäcker-Williams approach (where each photon is treated
as real), except at very low pair pT, where a lowest-order QED calculation works better [589]. UPC cal-
culations can be easily extended to include peripheral collisions [590–592]. The kinematic distributions
are similar to those in UPCs, and the cross-section depends on the range of impact parameters.

→

Recently, the ATLAS collaboration [582] presented results showing a dramatic modiﬁcation to
µ+µ− in peripheral collisions. Figure 59 shows the pair acoplanarity α, the azimuthal angular
γ γ
deviation from being perfectly back-to-back, and A, the energy imbalance between the two leptons. For
UPCs, they found good agreement with the STARlight [593,594] reference, with the data and calculations
peaked at small α and A. More central collisions show dramatic changes with the low-α peak largely
disappearing, and the A distributions only minimally changed. ATLAS described this as "Consistent with
order of magnitude estimates from kinetic theory for multiple scattering off electric charges in thermal
plasma." Multiple scattering would remove the peak at low α, but leave A largely unaffected. A recent
calculation ﬁnds that the magnitude of the change in α is at least roughly consistent with that expected
for leptons propagating through a Quark–Gluon Plasma [595]. If multiple scattering is large, though,
one might also expect some bremsstrahlung, which should increase A. To evaluate this further requires
a calculation of how many of the produced leptons are produced in the medium, and/or traverse it. An

alternate explanation could involve the leptons bending in the magnetic ﬁeld from the QGP. If a QGP
is electrically conducting, then it may acquire an induced magnetic ﬁeld from the short-lived magnetic
ﬁelds carried by the two nuclei [596]. The QGP ﬁeld, however, will be longer lived, and could bend the
produced leptons in opposite directions, reducing their coplanarity. Symmetry also predicts that it should
disappear for the most central collisions [595], except possibly for event-by-event ﬂuctuations.

The STAR Collaboration also has studied two-photon e+e− production in peripheral Au–Au col-
lisions; they found a small difference between their pair pT spectrum and calculations, and suggest that
it might be due to medium effects [580]. ALICE has not yet seen these pairs [579], likely because their
pair acceptance requires lepton pT > 1 GeV/c, eliminating most pairs from γ γ reactions.

Coupled with better theoretical calculations, the large Pb–Pb integrated luminosity in Run 3 and
4 can conﬁrm and dramatically expand our understanding of this effect. One important goal is to expand
the study to cover a much wider range of masses. Figure 60 shows the expected mass spectrum obtainable
1 integrated luminosity run, assuming no changes in the trigger; masses up to
by ATLAS for a 13 nb−
100 GeV/c2 should be accessible. These high mass pairs correspond to two-photon interactions in or very
near the two nuclei, so should show increased effects due to interactions with the medium or magnetic
ﬁelds associated with the Quark–Gluon Plasma.

In contrast, lower masses correspond to larger distances between the dilepton production point and
the nuclei, so in-medium effects may be smaller. These lower masses should be accessible with a softer
requirement on the muon momentum. It would also be interesting to compare e+e− with µ+µ− (and
possibly τ+ τ−), since the lighter leptons should interact more. If the leptons interact with the medium,
then the electron A distribution should show more change than that for muons.

8.2.2 Photonuclear interactions

In photonuclear interactions, a photon emitted by one nucleus ﬂuctuates to a quark-antiquark dipole,
which then scatters elastically from the other (target) nucleus, emerging as a real vector meson. The
scattering occurs via Pomeron exchange, which preserves the photon quantum numbers. In perturbative
QCD, Pomerons are made up of gluons, so the process is sensitive to the gluon distribution in the target
nucleus. UPC measurements are consistent with moderate gluon shadowing. In coherent scattering, the
typical pair pT is (cid:126)/RA. Incoherent scattering is also possible, with a lower cross-section. There the
quark-antiquark dipole scatters elastically from a single nucleon (or, at still higher pT inelastically from
a single nucleon), producing a vector meson with a typical pT of a few hundred MeV/c.

Both ALICE [579] and STAR [581] have observed coherent J/ψ photoproduction in peripheral
heavy-ion collisions. There are a number of parallel theoretical calculations [588, 597]. The photon
emission process is similar to the two-photon case, but the dipole-nucleons scattering happens at the
same time as the hadronic interaction, introducing several complications to the calculations. This im-
mediately raises several questions: What happens to the coherence if a target nucleon is involved in
an interaction? Does the dipole-nucleon interaction occur before or after the nuclear collisions? If the
hadronic interaction occurs ﬁrst, the target nucleon will have lost energy, so the photon-nucleon cross-
section will be smaller. A detailed calculation should consider both possibilities. There is also destructive
interference between photoproduction from the two possible target nuclei [598]; this interference extends
to higher pT for more central collisions, and should reduce the cross-section for the region where nuclear
collisions occur. At b = 0, we expect complete destructive interference. Ref. [588] makes predictions
for a variety of coherence conditions, and as Fig. 61 shows, ﬁnds that the ALICE and STAR data likely
lie below the region where there is complete coherence for both photon emission and scattering, but
probably above that where coherence is limited to only the spectator nucleons. This is not surprising,
but there is at least one element missing from this calculation. The lifetime of J/ψ particles is of the
20 s, far shorter than that of the expanding Quark–Gluon Plasma. Coherently photoproduced

100 MeV/c, so, near mid-rapidity, are moving at a small fraction of the speed of light.
J/ψ have pT ∼
Particularly for more central collisions, one would expect many of them to be engulfed by the expanded
QGP, before they have a chance to decay.

The ALICE error bars are large, and more data, from the current and future runs are needed to
pin down the centrality dependence of the cross section. More data will also allow access to additional
observables. A detailed study of the shape of dσ/dpT would shed more light on the possible loss of
coherence in more central collisions. There are also expected correlations between the reaction plane,
which can be determined from the hadronic part of the collision, with the photonuclear interaction.
Because the destructive interference between photoproduction at mid-rapidity on the two nuclei goes as
2 [599], the azimuthal direction of (cid:126)pT provides information about the azimuthal
σ
|
direction of (cid:126)b, i.e., the reaction plane. Thus, it can be used either as an independent measurement of
the reaction plane, or as a test of the loss of correlation. Also, the J/ψ polarization follows that of the
photon that produced it, so it also follows (cid:126)b, providing another probe of the reaction plane. With a large
data sample, one may also be able to probe incoherent J/ψ photoproduction, at least in very peripheral
hadronic collisions, where the signal-to-noise ratio is high.

8.3 Dark photons

g

Dark Matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is responsible for accounting for approximately 80%
of the matter in the Universe [600]. Dark matter cannot be incorporated into the Standard Model, so
the introduction of dark matter requires new interactions between dark matter particles and the ordinary
Standard Model particles via unknown dark-sector forces [601]. The dark sector could have a rich
structure with a few possible candidates, where one of them is regarded as Dark Photon (A(cid:48)) with Lmix ∝
2 F µνXµν. The dark photon is introduced as an extra-U (1) gauge boson and acts as a messenger particle
of a dark sector with the residual interaction (g) to the Standard Model particles. Understanding of
possible interactions of dark photons has been motivated by a number of astrophysical anomalies such as
antiproton spectrum in the cosmic rays measured by AMS Collaboration, positron excess in the cosmic
rays observed earlier by PAMELA [602] and conﬁrmed by FERMI [603] and AMS [604], and the long
standing discrepancy between the measured and the calculated anomalous magnetic moment of the muon
(g

8.4 Limitations and outlook

While the statistical precision for the measurement of low mass dielectrons and dimuons as well as real
photons will be sufﬁcient in LHC Run 3 and 4 to study their yield as a function transverse momentum
and with respect to the event plane (elliptic ﬂow), more differential measurements might still be limited.
The measurement of the photon polarization via the angular distribution of dileptons can not only pro-
vide information on the thermalization of the system, but also on the early stages of the collision [622].
Experimentally these distributions have been measured in the NA60 experiment [623], where no po-
larization was found concluding that the observed excess dimuons are in agreement with the thermal
emission from a a randomized system. In order to study the angular distributions, for example in the
Collins-Soper reference frame [624–626] in the polar angle θ and the azimuthal angle ϕ, a large data set
is needed (NA60 used

50000 excess µ+µ− pairs).

Another promising direction is measurement of Bose-Einstein (BE) correlations of direct photons.
With this probe one can trace space-time dimensions of the hottest part of the ﬁreball and moreover,
varying kT of the photon pair, one can select pairs coming mostly from earlier or later stages of the
collision and thus look at evolution of the ﬁreball. On the other hand, from the correlation strength
100 MeV/c. So far
parameter one can extract the direct photon spectrum down to very low pT ∼
there was one successful measurement of direct photon BE correlations by the WA98 Collaboration
[627], while at RHIC and LHC energies these measurements are still unavailable. The reason is that
the expected strength of these correlations λP Gg = 1/2(N dir
)2 is extremely small. Moreover,

γ /N tot

106

ALI-SIMUL-309974in contrast to massive particles, averaging of full 3D correlation function C2(qout, qside, qlong) to 1D
C2(qinv) results in further dramatic decrease of correlation strength [627]. This requires very large
statistics in addition to understanding the detector response.

A ﬁrst step to increase the statistical precision and the available data set for low-mass dileptons
could be a further upgrade of the inner barrel of silicon detectors of the ALICE apparatus that is cur-
rently under discussion [302]. The planned reduction of the material budget would reduce conversion
probability. In addition, an improvement of the tracking efﬁciency especially at low momentum would
increase the conversion rejection efﬁciency even further. First studies [302] showed that the statistical
uncertainty can be reduced by a factor 1.3, while the systematic uncertainty from the subtraction of the
combinatorial background would be reduced by a factor of two. With a better pointing resolution the
rejection of charm background is improved and would lead to a reduced systematic uncertainty from the
subtraction of the light-hadron and charm decay backgrounds by a factor of two.

Introduction

In the program of proton–proton collisions at the LHC, the main effort is focused on hard processes
which are embedded in an underlying event consisting of soft low-pT particles. The underlying event
is described using models, such as Pythia [512] or HERWIG [628], based on essentially free streaming
(i.e. no ﬁnal-state interactions) of the produced particles, supplemented by a non-perturbative cluster
or string fragmentation picture [629, 630] to model the non-perturbative soft-particle production. The
same models are used to describe minimum-bias events, i.e. events without any signal trigger, primar-
ily consisting of soft QCD interactions.
In the past years at LHC, during Run 1 and 2, this picture
was challenged by several observations that qualitatively differ from the model expectations and cannot
be accommodated by tuning of the existing models used to describe minimum-bias collisions and the
underlying event [631].

The ﬁrst such observation was the unexpected discovery in 2010 of azimuthal correlations of ﬁnal-
state hadrons in very high multiplicity proton–proton collisions [311], referred to by the ridge. These
persist at large separation in rapidity on the near side surrounding the jet-like peak. A few years later,
a similar observation was made in high multiplicity p–Pb collisions [312]. By subtracting the jet-like
contribution in p–Pb collisions, a second long-range rapidity correlation on the away side, back-to-back
in azimuth to the ﬁrst observed correlation, was extracted [313, 314]. Even later, the procedure was
adapted to pp collisions, allowing one to identify two long-range contributions also in high-multiplicity
pp collisions [632,633]. Under certain assumptions even lower-multiplicity pp collisions show the same
features [632]. With these observations the similarity of small and large collision systems with respect
to azimuthal correlations had been clearly demonstrated.

The second observation was that of enhanced production of multi-strange hadrons in high-
multiplicity pp collisions extending the puzzle from ﬁnal-state particle kinematics to include also
hadrochemistry. Already after Run 1, several experiments reported that ratios of strange to non-strange
particle yields, in minimum-bias collisions, could not be described using model ﬁts obtained from
LEP data [634–637]. After systematic studies of this discrepancy, it was found that not only does
strangeness increase smoothly with particle density at mid-rapidity in pp collisions, the dependence on
this observable continues smoothly to p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions [638].

Initially, these collision systems were thought as a reference for the effects observed in Pb–Pb
collisions. But the discovery of these qualitatively new features has turned the study of small systems into
a ﬁeld on its own, with signiﬁcant interest in both the heavy-ion and the high-energy physics community.

In ultra-relativistic nucleus–nucleus collisions, ranging from early SPS experiments at CERN
through the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to LHC,
similar observations have been interpreted as evidence of formation of a droplet of thermalised Quark–
Gluon Plasma. The long-range azimuthal correlations, and in particular their lowest harmonic component
v2, have been used in combination with relativistic ﬂuid-dynamical modeling to constrain the material

properties of the plasma. The striking result from RHIC was that the plasma formed in central nucleus–
nucleus collisions ﬂows as a liquid nearly without dissipation such that its speciﬁc shear viscosity η/s
– quantifying the dissipative properties of the medium – was found to be smaller than that of any other
0.16 was found to
known substance. The inferred value of the speciﬁc shear viscosity η/s

closer to the expectation of holographic model calculations of strongly coupled (maximally supersym-
. These models can be

seen as models of ﬂuids with minimal dissipation allowed by basic principles of quantum mechanics
thus giving rise to the paradigm of Quark–Gluon Plasma as a perfect liquid. Perfect liquid models do, by
deﬁnition, not have any quasi-particle structure. This means that they do not have any degrees of freedom
which can free stream for an appreciable amount of time, compared to their de Broglie wavelength. In
that context it is notable that the observation of ﬂuid–like signatures in small systems can be described
as a small modiﬁcation of the free streaming evolution, challenging the perfect-ﬂuid paradigm.

There are several theoretical pictures that have been suggested to explain the smooth onset of
signals of collectivity in small systems. The pp event generators have been supplemented on the one
hand with elements describing string or cluster fragmentation in a dense medium [639, 640] to address
the hadrochemistry, and on the other hand with ﬁnal-state interactions between the fragmenting strings
to account for the ﬁnal-state kinematical correlations [641]. The models underlying pp event generators
can then in turn be extrapolated to cover p–Pb and Pb–Pb collision systems, which is an approach
used since the 1980’s [575, 642]. Recent theoretical developments [643, 644] have improved the state of
such extrapolations to a degree where also the supplemented hadronisation models can be extrapolated
in order to provide a microscopic picture of the QGP even in large systems. The question whether such
extrapolations will give even a qualitative description of the observed features is still open.

At the same time, the description of large systems has been employed in regimes initially thought
to be not accessible by models implementing the perfect-ﬂuid paradigm. Their application down to
proton–proton collisions [211, 645, 646], taken at face value, would imply the formation of a nearly
perfect liquid even in the smallest collision systems. Furthermore, pQCD based saturation models can
describe the emergence of charged-particle azimuthal anisotropy (vn) [647]. In these models the ﬁnal-
state azimuthal correlations can arise either from the intrinsic correlations in the nuclear wave function
(initial-state correlations) as correlated anisotropic particle production or as a ﬁnal-state interaction after
the initial particle production. In heavy-ion collisions, statistical models [648] have been very successful
in describing the hadrochemistry of particle yields. Their extension to pp collisions shows promise,
but similarly with points of tension [649]. Regardless of whether the approach is to extrapolate from
pp to Pb–Pb collisions or the other way around, it is crucial to establish that any such model can
capture the essential features of intermediate systems. Asymmetric collision systems such as p–Pb,
provide challenges and opportunities for both approaches. They may be used as a necessary intermediate
stepping stone for pp to A–A extrapolations, and they provide possible discrimination between saturation
and ﬂuid approaches as a possible point of tension [650, 651].

A question remains to what extent these different models are describing qualitatively different
physical phenomena or to what extent they are different representations of the same underlying physics
of ﬁnal-state interactions. For this reason it is important to develop theoretical tools that encompass
both the ﬂuid-dynamic limit and the free-streaming limit to theoretically describe how the microscopic
physics that leads to ﬂuid-dynamic behavior in A–A collisions should represent itself in small systems.
An attempt to do so comes from transport theory, which can describe microscopic interactions but in
the limit of large number of ﬁnal-state interactions allows for a coarse-grained effective description in
terms of ﬂuid dynamics. As such, transport theory has the potential to bridge the gap between small
systems, where ﬁnal-state interactions act as small modiﬁcation to the free-streaming evolution, and cen-
tral nucleus–nucleus collisions where the ﬁnal-state interactions bring the matter to the ﬂuid-dynamical
limit [216].

109

The experimental program in the large intermediate region — spanning from mid-central Pb–
Pb and Xe–Xe collisions, through p–Pb collisions down to minimum-bias pp collisions — offers a
possibility to bridge the difference between the two limits by providing a setup where the microscopic
ﬁnal-state interactions that lead in central Pb–Pb collision to the formation of a QGP may be studied in
isolation in the limit of small number of ﬁnal-state interactions.

The suggested theoretical pictures may have implications for high-energy physics analyses, which
depend on reliable models of the underlying event. As an example, it has been recently shown that the dis-
cussed long-range correlations are also present in the underlying event of Z-tagged pp collisions [652].
The direct implication is the necessity for questioning the correct description of the underlying event of
MC models. As the usual models used to describe the underlying event do not describe such long-range
correlations, even qualitatively, the uncertainty introduced by imposing a model dependence, might be
larger than expected, as e.g. shown for colour reconnection effects on t¯t ﬁnal states [653]. As such,
better descriptions of collective effects in small systems could also probe vital for reducing uncertainties
in high-energy physics analyses.

The main experimental task in future years is a detailed examination and characterization of the
observed effects in pp, p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions, in order to understand whether such effects are
different or similar in origin in small and large systems. For such a task to be successful, all three types
of collision systems, pp, p–Pb and Pb–Pb must be utilized, as they each offer unique features not ob-
tainable from the other systems. The central Pb–Pb collision system is so far the only one where all
features of collectivity (including multi–particle correlations, jet quenching, quarkonia supression, ther-
mal photons and hadrochemistry) have been observed. For the study of small collision systems, central
Pb–Pb offers the only viable true collective reference. Conversely, pp is so far the smallest collision
system where collective effects have been observed, and the only system where a smooth transition to
the e+e− expectation could be reasonably expected. In the intermediate region p–Pb collisions are the
only one of the three collision systems which offer, both, a saturation dominated initial state with a well
known geometry, and, in a single event the Pb-going and p-going direction allowing the study between
both regimes. The potential study of O–O collisions provides an interesting system with smaller ﬂuctu-
ations in the number of participating nucleons. Furthermore, the detailed study of asymmetric collision
systems provides valuable input both to models extrapolating pp dynamics to Pb–Pb collisions, and for
providing quantitative distinction between initial-state saturation effects and ﬁnal-state interactions.

This chapter is structured as follows: Section 9.2 gives an overview presenting the observations
that have been made and comparing them between pp, p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions. Subsequently,
Sect. 9.3 summarizes the open questions and discusses how these can be addressed at HL-LHC. Sect. 9.4
details the multiplicity distribution which needs to be extrapolated to be used for performance studies,
the expected energy densities and the data-taking conditions assumed. A set of performance studies
which address the open questions are introduced in Sect. 9.5–9.9 ranging from correlation measures,
over hadrochemistry to signatures of energy loss and thermal radiation. Finally, Sect. 9.10 presents the
opportunities of a short run of O–O collisions.

9.2 Overview of experimental results and critical assessment

This section will give an overview where the measurements in Pb–Pb, p–Pb and pp collisions at LHC
provide a consistent picture and where differences emerge. In addition, it is pointed out where measure-
ments are missing and where additional data is needed which forms the basis for the projections given
in the subsequent sections of this chapter. Table 8 lists the different observables and if they have been
measured in the Pb–Pb, p–Pb and pp collision systems. In the following a critical assessment of the
ﬁndings is performed.

multiplicity. If this is interpreted by using a combined blast-wave parametrisation in Pb–Pb collisions4
a larger radial ﬂow is observed in pp and p–Pb collisions at the same multiplicity [655] as expected by
Ref. [656]. In the intermediate pT region (2 < pT < 5 GeV/c), enhancement of baryon-to-meson ratios
is observed in all three systems. Recombination models suggest that the number of constituent quarks
of the hadrons determine this enhancement [317, 657–663]. Particle ratios and yields are described as
in the Grand Canonical ensemble by the statistical model with the strangeness undersaturation factor
1 with an accuracy of approximately 10–30% for Pb–Pb collisions and at 20–40% level for p–Pb
γS ≈
collisions (except for the Ω meson). The statistical model has been so far applied to minimum-bias pp
collisions and when treated as a canonical ensemble, was found to describe the yields with γC
S < 1 and
deviations of only about 20–40% from the expected yields [318, 638, 664, 665].

Pressure-driven expansion and anisotropies Assuming that the pressure gradients build up early
in the evolution of the created system, initial spatial anisotropies (εn) translate into ﬁnal momentum
anisotropies, namely anisotropic ﬂow (vn) in a system with small viscosity. A large number of detailed
studies have been done on different coefﬁcients of anisotropic ﬂow. Higher-order ﬂow harmonics are
in particular more sensitive to initial-state ﬂuctuations and therefore can constrain the initial conditions
of the system. Anisotropic ﬂow has been measured with two-particle correlation techniques up to v7 in
Pb–Pb, v5 in p–Pb, and v4 in pp collisions for charged particles. These vn coefﬁcients exhibit weaker
multiplicity dependence in pp and p–Pb collisions than in Pb–Pb collisions where this is closely related
to the shape of the overlap region [48, 312–314, 632, 633, 678–688].

≥

Higher-order cumulants have been measured using Lee-Yang Zeros (LYZ) method and multi-
particle correlation techniques with up to 8 particles in both Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions and up to 6 par-
ticles in pp collisions [316,683,688,697–708]. Interestingly, for each collision system, the measurements
of the cumulants at different orders (n
4) are similar within 10%. The presence of non-zero higher-
order cumulants with similar magnitude can be interpreted as evidence for a hydrodynamically evolving
system. However, some disfavor this interpretation since models that do not incorporate hydrodynamics
have also been able to reproduce these results [756–758]. The pT-differential vn measurements for identi-
ﬁed particles show the characteristic mass dependence of anisotropic ﬂow up to v5 in Pb–Pb, v3 in p–Pb,
and v2 in pp collisions where heavier particles are depleted at low pT [48, 315, 326, 683, 686, 689–691].
In Pb–Pb collisions this is ascribed to the interplay between radial ﬂow and anisotropic ﬂow harmonics
at low pT and recombination at higher pT. This characteristic mass dependence has been described by
hydrodynamic calculations to a good approximation in all three systems. In the intermediate pT val-
ues in all three systems a meson-baryon grouping can be observed which points to a combination of
hydrodynamics and quark coalescence (or recombination).

The non-linear hydrodynamic response of the system has been probed using symmetric cumulants
which quantify the correlation between different anisotropic ﬂow harmonics. Symmetric cumulants, that
are also known as mixed harmonics, have been measured in all three systems up to SC(5,3) in Pb–Pb
and SC(4,2) in p–Pb and pp collisions [227, 687, 709–712]. Different order harmonic correlations have
different sensitivities to the transport properties of the system and the initial conditions. Based on the
hydrodynamic calculations the data favour a small shear viscosity [759].
In addition, the linear and
non-linear hydrodynamic response has been investigated in Pb–Pb collisions up to the sixth order ﬂow
harmonic [713]. These new observables, i.e.
linear and non-linear ﬂow modes, are very sensitive to
details of the hydrodynamic modelling, i.e. initial conditions and the transport properties of the system.
Current data–model comparison show this sensitivity which help to constrain the transport properties of
the QGP created in Pb–Pb collisions [713]. Linear (vL
n ) ﬂow modes in pp and p–
Pb collisions are not yet measured and can constrain the transport properties as well as initial conditions
of these small systems. Furthermore, hydrodynamic calculations capture qualitatively "higher-order"

4A combined blast-wave parametrisation model is a blast-wave model that ﬁts charged pions, kaons and (anti-)protons
simultaneously. In [654], combined blast-wave parametrisation perfectly describes π± (0.5 < pT < 1 GeV/c), K ± (0.2 <
pT < 1.5 GeV/c) and p + p (0.3 < pT < 3 GeV/c).

details, such as the breaking of factorization due to event-plane angle decorrelations in pT and η measured
in both Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions [684, 720, 721]. With the existing data such measurements are not
yet possible in pp collisions. Similarly, event-by-event vn measurements have only been done in Pb–Pb
collisions [723–725] and it would be interesting to study those in both p–Pb and pp collisions.

Directed ﬂow, for the rapidity-odd as well as the rapidity-even components, of charged particles
at mid-rapidity was measured relative to the collision symmetry plane deﬁned by the spectator nucleons,
and evidence for dipole-like initial-state density ﬂuctuations in the overlap region was found in Pb–Pb
collisions [692]. In small systems, the concept of directed ﬂow is less clear, especially in pp collisions.
If there is collectivity in pp collisions, one could also expect a non-zero directed ﬂow measurement.
This is technically challenging since the measurement of the spectator plane is not feasible in small

Pb collisions [693, 695]. The balance function probes the charge creation time and the development of
collectivity in the produced system. These measurements are consistent with the picture of a system
exhibiting larger radial ﬂow with increasing multiplicity but also whose charges are created at the later
stages of the collision. The charge-dependent azimuthal correlations are measured in both Pb–Pb and
p–Pb collisions [672–675, 677]. These correlations quantify the inﬂuence of the chiral magnetic effect
(CME) and the chiral magnetic wave (CMW) on the produced particles. These correlators are also
sensitive to strong background contributions, for example from local charge conservation and possibly
radial and anisotropic ﬂow.

The freeze-out radii in three orthogonal directions ("out", "side", "long") can be deduced from
measurements of quantum-statistic correlations between pairs of same-charge pions and kaons (HBT) at
low-momentum transfer. The HBT radii in all collision systems are found to scale with 3√Nch indicating
a constant density at freeze-out, and to decrease with increasing pair momentum kT as expected from
hydrodynamics. The size along the emission direction is similar to the geometric size of the system

Direct photons Direct-photon measurements in the low pT region are so far performed in Pb–Pb
and pp collisions. The measurements are reproduced by models assuming the formation of a QGP in
Pb–Pb collisions [544]. In this measurement, one cannot discriminate between the available models
due to the large systematic uncertainties: models incorporating different initial temperatures, i.e. from
385 to 740 MeV in the most central Pb–Pb collisions, are able to reproduce the measurements. Nev-
ertheless, the comparison among these models suggests that the initial temperature in central Pb–Pb
collisions must exceed about 400 MeV [544]. No signiﬁcant direct-photon signal has been extracted in
pp collisions at current available center-of-mass energies [726].

Energy loss The created system in Pb–Pb collisions is opaque for high-pT colored probes. Due
to radiational and collisional energy loss high-pT colored probes are strongly suppressed (jet quenching)
whereas the system is transparent for photons and other colorless probes [323, 344, 346, 347, 352, 730–
732, 735]. Jet quenching leads to a large asymmetry in back-to-back jet pT and slightly modiﬁed jet
fragmentation functions inside small jet cone sizes (R = 0.4). Most of the radiated energy appears at
large angles (R > 0.8) [348, 360, 374, 727, 728].

On the contrary, the picture is different in p–Pb collisions: measurements of inclusive high-pT
hadron and inclusive jet yields in minimum-bias p–Pb collisions at the LHC are consistent with RpPb =
1 within the current accuracy of approximately 20%; i.e. no evidence of medium-induced modiﬁcation
is observed [323, 733, 734, 736, 737]. For event classes split by event activity, neither medium-induced
modiﬁcation in inclusive hadron production nor dijet transverse momentum imbalance are observed [323,
729, 737]; in contrast, for inclusive jet yields RpPb is strongly suppressed relative to unity in “central”
p–Pb collisions, and strongly enhanced in “peripheral” p–Pb collisions [736], attributed to selection
biases [738].

113

The semi-inclusive yield of jets recoiling from a high-pT trigger hadron has been used to search
for jet quenching in p–Pb collisions [738]. This observable is trigger-normalized and semi-inclusive,
and it therefore has greater systematic sensitivity to jet quenching effects in small systems than inclusive
jet observables. Nevertheless, no signiﬁcant jet quenching effects within the uncertainties of the mea-
surement have been observed. These uncertainties can be expressed as an upper limit of 400 MeV (at
90% CL) on medium-induced energy transport outside a jet cone with R = 0.4. This value is a factor 20
smaller than the magnitude of out-of-cone energy transport measured by a similar approach in Pb–Pb
collisions [354].

Heavy ﬂavour Due to interactions and rescattering with the medium, also heavy-ﬂavour particles
exhibit ﬁnite anisotropies as shown with non-zero v2 measurements for heavy ﬂavour particles in both
Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions [262, 326, 460–464, 497, 741–745], see also Chapter 5. In addition, J/ψ sup-
pression in Pb–Pb collisions shows an enhancement w.r.t. RHIC energies [750]. Models incorporating
a J/ψ regeneration component from deconﬁned charm quarks in the medium can reproduce these mea-
surements [454, 750]. The limited understanding of cold nuclear matter effects in the open charm cross
section determination, however, restricts the ability of these models to fully describe the experimental
data on J/ψ production in Pb–Pb collisions [755]. The size of these effects can be quantiﬁed by mea-
surements in p–Pb collision. In p–Pb collisions, J/ψ is suppressed relative to pp collisions [755]. The
production of the excited charmonium state, Ψ(2S) as well as different bottomonium states (Υ(nS)) have
been measured in both Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions [478, 492, 748, 750, 754] which shows a suppression
w.r.t. the ground state.

9.3 Open questions and new opportunities at HL-LHC

The previous section has extensively reviewed the state-of-the-art experimental knowledge of pp and
p–Pb collisions. Certain gaps in knowledge became apparent due to either insufﬁcient available data or
shortcomings in the present detectors. The HL era of LHC can make a signiﬁcant step ahead in many
areas. The most relevant ones are discussed with dedicated performance projections in the remainder of
this chapter.

Run 3 and 4 will allow the study of unprecedentedly high-multiplicity pp collisions. In order to do
estimates in this regime, Sect. 9.4 will establish a ﬁrm extrapolation of the multiplicity distribution based
on current LHC data together with a review of the data sample to expect. The large multiplicities bring
a qualitatively new feature: a wide overlap between pp and Pb–Pb collisions up to about 65% central
collisions allowing a unique opportunity to compare observables in a small (pp) and large (Pb–Pb)
system at the same multiplicity. Studies in p–Pb collisions amend the picture. Given that multiplicity is
not the only driving variable of a system, comparisons of estimates of the energy density in pp, p–Pb and
Pb–Pb collisions are made below. The uniqueness of these extreme multiplicity pp collisions warrants
that the study of their global-event properties are an interesting subject in itself, see Sect. 9.5.

Subsequently, a set of key observables is presented which require either the large data samples
or the upgraded detectors.
In particular the measurement of thermal dileptons proﬁts from the new
ALICE pixel detector with reduced material budget, and the measurement of higher-order correlations
from the extended tracker acceptance in Run 4 in ATLAS and CMS. Correlations at higher orders using
the subevent method will provide an essentially non-ﬂow free measurement of vn coefﬁcients and their
inter-correlations measured through symmetric cumulants, see Sect. 9.6. These measurements focus on
two interesting regimes: at high multiplicity where the overlap with Pb–Pb collisions will be studied,
and at low multiplicity to answer the question on the onset of collective phenomena. This section also
shows that the measurement of the probability distribution of event-by-event v2 becomes for the ﬁrst
time feasible in small systems, a quantity presently completely unknown in pp collisions.

The smooth increase of strange-particle production across system size is one of the key surprising
ﬁndings from Run 2 pp physics. A projection of the reach at HL-LHC is given in Sect. 9.7 showing
that the question if the thermal limit, given by statistical models in Pb–Pb collisions, is reached also in

pp collisions can be answered. A puzzling ﬁnding is the absence of jet quenching in p–Pb collisions
with the measurements performed in Run 1 and 2. If ﬁnal-state interactions are to explain the observed
collective phenomena, also energy loss of traversing partons should be measurable. Section 9.8 discusses
how jet quenching can be observed in Run 3 and 4 if present, or alternatively how a stringent limit can
be set. Performance studies are presented for hadron–jet, γ–jet and Z–jet correlations, both, in p–Pb
and pp collisions. Finally, the potential to detect thermal radiation and extract a medium temperature
in p–Pb collisions is presented in Sect. 9.9. Such a measurement would constitute a strong indication
of the formation of an emitting medium. Finally, the potential of colliding smaller nuclei, in particular
oxygen, is assessed in Sect. 9.10.

9.4 Proton–proton collisions at extreme multiplicities

9.4.1 Multiplicity distribution

For the performance estimates at high multiplicity in pp collisions, a multiplicity-distribution extrapola-
tion has been used which is based on existing ALICE (
< 2.5) [761,762]
data. Data from CMS [763] is compatible with the used distributions and is therefore not explicitly in-
cluded in the extrapolation. A parameterisation with a single5 negative binomial distribution is used to

The data is shown in Fig. 64 overlaid with the ﬁt with a single negative binomial distribution of
the tail of the distribution (20–40% of the cross-section). The three parameters of this ﬁt are itself ﬁt with
a power law to extrapolate to √s = 14 TeV.

The resulting extrapolated multiplicity distribution for 14 TeV is shown in Fig. 65 for the ALICE
and ATLAS case. In addition, these are compared scaled by their respective average multiplicities. The
agreement is rather good, with some discrepancy in the tail of the distribution. The extrapolation based
on the smaller phase-space region falls off more quickly with multiplicity, and is therefore used as the
conservative estimate for the extrapolations in this chapter.

9.4.2 Energy density

While the multiplicity is a convenient and well-deﬁned observable to compare different collision systems,
the underlying dynamics may be driven by other properties. In large collision systems, the energy density
(cid:15) is often used to characterize the system and the expected effects. Figure 66 shows an estimate of the
energy density for pp, p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions based on IP-Glasma [766] as well as on the Bjorken

For the latter, the input is the multiplicity-dependent
(cid:104)
transverse overlap from a Glauber MC [768]. The energy density is calculated at ﬁxed τ = 0.2 fm/c.
It should be noted that these assumptions can be challenged and other ways to calculate (cid:15) are available
which can lead to largely different value in particular in pp and p–Pb collisions. Here the aim is only to
show that the energy density depends on the system at a ﬁxed multiplicity, and can reach large values in
pp and p–Pb collisions, of the order of central Pb–Pb collisions.

9.4.3 Data-taking conditions and integrated luminosity for pp collisions
1 is assumed
For the performance studies in this chapter, a high-multiplicity sample of Lint = 200 pb−
per experiment. In order to assure a clean trigger, collisions at low µ
1 are needed which requires
special runs or special conditions at the end of ﬁll for ATLAS and CMS. For LHCb, the comparatively
low pileup and good vertex resolution should allow for recording high-multiplicity events during normal
running conditions at a pile up of about ﬁve visible pp interactions. ALICE generally runs at low µ and
can collect a similar sample over a longer data-taking period. For Run 4, the upgraded tracking and
vertex detectors in ATLAS and CMS may allow to isolate high-multiplicity collisions also in a large µ
environment. This option needs to be carefully studied.

≈

Table 9 gives the fraction of cross-section and the number of events in ﬁve multiplicity classes:
5–7, 7–10, 10–12, 12–14 and 14–16 times the average multiplicity. Table 10 gives the number of events
of bins with equivalent multiplicity than commonly measured multiplicity bins in p–Pb and Pb–Pb
collisions. For the calculation of the number of events σinel = 78.4 mb [768] is used. These tables
are the key input for the performance ﬁgures presented in this chapter. The conversion of the provided
dNch/dη to multiplicity ranges with larger pseudorapidity coverage is done for simplicity assuming a
ﬂat pseudorapidity distribution within
< 2.5. For the conversion to a phase space with a pT cut as
employed in many current measurements a set of conversation factors is used, listed in Tab. 11.

9.5 Global-event properties

The measurement of global-event observables in rare high-multiplicity pp collisions are of interest in
itself. The shape of the multiplicity distribution, which has been largely extrapolated in the previous
section, is today a challenge for models. The dynamics of producing very large multiplicity events is not
understood in detail and therefore the shape of the distribution is an important input. Furthermore, studies
as a function of multiplicity [767] have shown a strong increase with multiplicity. However,
of
those measurements exist only up to dNch/dη
55, while the measurements at HL-LHC promise a
measurement beyond twice that value.

pT(cid:105)
(cid:104)

≈

The shape of the multiplicity distribution and the growth of

are closely connected to the
physics of multiple parton interactions: high-multiplicity collisions are understood as originating from
the collision of multiple partons within the same pp collisions. It has been shown that the number of (low
momentum transfer) parton interactions increases linearly with multiplicity with a possible saturation at
large multiplicity [770]. The prospect of showing that adding another parton interaction to an already
busy event may be strongly suppressed, is an important ingredient to a revised conceptual understanding
of particle production in high-energy pp collisions. Together with the studies of symmetric cumulants
(see the subsequent Section), HL-LHC will determine not only if there is a saturation limit for multiple
parton interactions, but also the parton structure within the proton.

9.6 Particle correlations

The measurements of two-particle correlations and higher-order cumulants have been the initial obser-
vations of collective-like effects in small systems. In pp collisions, two distinct regions are of interest at
HL-LHC: the high-multiplicity tail to compare to p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions and the low-multiplicity
region to investigate the onset of these effects. In the following, several performance estimates are given
as examples for the rich physics which can be addressed.

challenge the description of the observed phenomena within initial-state saturation models. Their mea-
surement in small systems can provide important insight in the validity of the hydrodynamic description
of the observed phenomena. Here, symmetric cumulants probe in particular the proton substructure [771]

which is needed to provide a solid description of the initial state, a necessary ingredient for the hydro-
dynamic description. The present uncertainties of such measurement in small systems are too large for
a deﬁnitive conclusion, in particular in pp collisions, due to the dominance of non-ﬂow like jets and
resonance decays. Figure 68 shows the performance projection of SC(2, 3) =
for
HL-LHC for pp and p–Pb collisions. The uncertainties of the measurement without subevents would
become practically invisible, however, those stay dominated by non-ﬂow effects. A measurement requir-
ing two, three and even four subevents becomes possible with uncertainties of the order of a few times
7 depending on multiplicity. Such results can give a deﬁnitive answer if a similar hydrodynamic

Figure 70 (left panel) illustrates the reach which can be obtained for the v2 measurement of heavy-
ﬂavoured objects in p–Pb collisions. Shown are projections for heavy-ﬂavour electrons and inclusive
J/ψ by ALICE as well as for prompt D and J/ψ by CMS. Minor uncertainties are expected for this
observable with the potential to demonstrate for the ﬁrst time with signiﬁcance the ﬁnal-state interaction

The vn ﬂuctuates on an event-by-event basis as no two nuclei have identical parton distribution.
The probability density distribution of vn, p(vn) is closely related to event-by-event ﬂuctuations of the ec-

centricities, p(εn) as v2 ∝
conditions and the ﬁnal-state dynamics of the medium. To characterise the initial-state spatial anisotropy

probability density distributions for v2 at Pb–Pb collisions are described well by the Bessel-Gaussian
function at central collisions and less in peripheral collisions [723–725]. This deviation from the Bessel-
Gaussian function is expected in peripheral collisions as k2 increases slightly at large (cid:15)2 values [772].
Measurements are well described by the elliptic power functions in all centrality intervals of Pb–Pb
collisions [724]. These measurement have not yet been attempted in small systems due to the insufﬁcient
available statistics. Figure 70 (right panel) presents a projection for the measurement of p(vn) in pp col-
lisions. This extrapolation is based on the p(v2) measurement in 60–65% centrality Pb–Pb collisions at
√sNN = 2.76 TeV [723]. In this simple study, the same signal is assumed although the mean and width
of the distribution is most likely smaller in pp collisions. Such a measurement would constitute the ﬁrst
measurement of p(vn) in pp collisions, and can shed important light on the nature of the observed v2
coefﬁcients.

9.7 Strangeness enhancement

The unexpected increase of the strange-particle yield normalized by the pion yield as a function of
Nch is one of the key observations in small systems.
In pp collisions these ratios are measured up
17 with some overlap with p–Pb collisions. The most peripheral Pb–Pb collisions
to dNch/dη
≈
96, nearly 6 times larger. Figure 71 presents the expected reach of the
measured have a dNch/dη
Ω/π ratio in pp collisions which will bridge the present gap between pp and Pb–Pb collisions.
In
particular, if the measured increasing trend would continue, the Ω/π ratio would grow larger than in
peripheral Pb–Pb collisions. Assuming that strangeness enhancement scales with the energy density of
the system, Fig. 66 suggests that it should indeed be possible to see that the high-multiplicity pp results
exceed the low multiplicity Pb–Pb results (crossover). Whether the signature will be as striking as the

projection in Fig. 71, depends on the details of the assumed scaling law. At this point simulations are not
precise enough to provide quantitative predictions of such a crossover, and HL-LHC experimental results
on strangeness enhancement will as such be driving the theoretical development. The scenario with a
clear crossover will be immediately distinguishable from a scenario where the Ω/π ratio ﬂattens, and
connects smoothly with the Pb–Pb result. Such a result will in itself also be groundbreaking, as it will
indicate that the thermal limit reached in Pb–Pb collisions will already be realized in high-multiplicity
pp collision.

9.8 Energy loss
As discussed in Sect. 9.2, inclusive high-pT hadron and jet yields show at present no evidence of medium-
induced energy loss in p–Pb collisions, and suffer from selection biases if measured in event classes.
Inclusive measurements with the large event set expected at HL-LHC therefore do not help to resolve the
question of energy loss in small systems. However, coincidence measurements of jets recoiling against a
trigger object are not subject to such biases, and have the potential to identify small energy-loss effects or
put stringent upper limits. In this section, projections are given for correlations between high-pT hadrons
and jets, as well as jets and γ and Z.

Figure 72 shows a projection of the measurement of semi-inclusive hadron–jet correlations in LHC
Run 3 and 4, for pp collisions at √s = 14 TeV and p–Pb collisions at √sNN = 5.02 TeV. The ﬁgure
shows the ratio of trigger-normalized recoil spectra for events selected on high and low event-activity
(EA) classes. This projection is based on Pythia simulations for pp collisions, which gives the expected
number of charged-hadron triggers in the interval 15 < pT,trig < 20 GeV (scaled by A to model p–Pb
collisions), and the per-trigger recoil jet spectrum. The measured enhancement in the per-event high-pT
hadron yield for pp collisions in high-multiplicity collisions [655] has been taken into account.

The projection represents the case where no energy loss occurs for high-EA relative to low-EA
collisions, and demonstrates the statistically achievable limit. The 90% conﬁdence level for a possible
EA-dependent spectrum shift due to large-angle energy transport from jet quenching [738] is 70 MeV/c

Projections for the correlation of jets and γ as well as jets and Z are presented in Fig. 73 for pp
and p–Pb collisions. Shown are distribution of the momentum fraction xjX = pjet
T where X is the
γ or Z. Given that the γ and Z can be considered unmodiﬁed by ﬁnal-state interactions, a potential
energy loss acting on the jet would directly alter the xjX distribution. For pp collisions, the left panel of
Fig. 73 presents the distribution for different classes in multiplicity based on Pythia, demonstrating the
reach. It can be also seen that the distribution shifts signiﬁcantly as a function of multiplicity without
ﬁnal-state interactions, but purely due to the presence of an underlying event. This shift is caused by
selection biases, e.g. the likelihood of multi-jet events is increased by requiring higher event multiplicity.
In order to extract a ﬁrm conclusion on energy loss, this observable needs to be compared to theoretical
calculations or tuned generators which reproduce multiplicity and underlying-event ﬂuctuations in e+e−
and pp collisions. The right panel of Fig. 73 presents the projection for p–Pb collisions for MB collisions
but in different pseudorapidity intervals sensitive to potential differences in the p and Pb hemisphere.

9.9 Thermal Radiation

The measurement of thermal radiation in p–Pb collisions can be considered as a smoking gun for the
formation of a system with an energy scale above the phase-transition temperature, see Chapter 8. In
order to estimate the sensitivity to the thermal radiation in p–Pb collisions, a similar strategy as in
Sec. 8.1.2 was used. The combinatorial background was scaled from Pb–Pb collisions to the expected
number of pairs in p–Pb collisions. The pair efﬁciency (including the efﬁciency for rejecting e+e− pairs
from semileptonic charm decays) is assumed to be the same as in Pb–Pb collisions. Subsequently, the
temperature of the QGP is extracted in the same way as in Sec. 8.1.2. The minimum thermal photon to

9.10 Potential of O–O Collisions

A promising opportunity to study the emergence of collective phenomena further as well as the presence
of possible parton energy loss in small collision systems, are collisions of smaller nuclei. In particular,
collisions of oxygen are an efﬁcient way of investigating the properties of low-multiplicity heavy-ion
collisions, which in large A–A systems only occurs for peripheral geometries. The achieved multiplic-
ities in O–O collisions are similar to p–Pb collisions with the signiﬁcant advantage that the collision
geometry is much better deﬁned. This is demonstrated in Fig. 75, which shows the correlations between
number of participants, multiplicities and impact parameter in O–O and p–Pb collisions. The correla-
tions between Npart and impact parameter as well as multiplicity and Npart is much narrower in O–O
collisions as compared to p–Pb collisions. Consequently, highest multiplicities in p–Pb collisions are
only accessible in the tail of the distribution while similar multiplicities are already reached in O–O
collisions in the plateau region. This is shown in Fig. 76 illustrated for the 20–40% event class.

The

studies have been been performed for the 2018 beam conﬁgurations at √sNN = 6.5 TeV, while the Run
3 conﬁguration would yield √sNN = 7 TeV, with the advantage that a large pp reference data set already
exists from earlier LHC running (2010–11).

ilar multiplicities as for central O–O collisions while roughly accounting for the artiﬁcial suppression
caused by the multiplicity bias present in such peripheral Pb–Pb collisions [735], allows to estimate the
expected effect on the RAA in O–O collisions to about 20%. Out of this deviation from unity, about
half can be attributed to biases due to the multiplicity selection in such small collision systems already
in absence of nuclear effects [773]. An observable deviations from unity of about 10% caused by energy
loss in the produced medium remains. While this expected suppression may seem small, it should be
1. In case such a suppression was absent, the
possible to measure it already with an Lint of a few 100 µb−
conclusion can be drawn that small collision systems do not exhibit measurable energy loss, while other
collective features are present, challenging the role of signiﬁcant ﬁnal-state interactions as underlying
mechanism. It should be noted that the absence of suppression can most likely not be taken as a proof
against the formation of the QGP, as it may be that the fast partons are emerging without seeing the
medium, either because they are emitted from the surface or because their formation time is longer than
the time within the medium. On the contrary, as discussed in Sect. 9.8 the ﬁrst observation of energy loss
in small systems would clearly conﬁrm models in which ﬁnal-state interactions play an important role

The study of bulk particle production in O–O collisions has twofold interest: Firstly, the depen-
dence of the pseudorapidity density of charged particles scaled by participant pairs on √s is stronger in
A–A collisions than in pp and p–A collisions [776]. The rise for p–Pb and d–Au collisions is simi-
lar to the one of inelastic pp collisions indicating that the stronger rise in A–A collisions might not be
solely related to the multiple collisions undergone by the participants since the proton in p–A collisions
also encounters multiple nucleons. High-energy O–O collisions promise to study this √s dependence
further in a regime of small number of participants. Secondly, a strong correlation between initial state
geometry (collision eccentricity) and observed ﬂow has been established since RHIC [777], and pertains
at LHC, in Pb–Pb and Xe–Xe collisions [778]. As shown in Fig. 77, the eccentricity proﬁles of Xe–Xe
and Pb–Pb collisions are, however, quite similar, and collision systems exhibiting a different geometry
as O–O could therefore provide further insight into the connection between initial-state geometry and
multi-particle correlations [779].

9.11 Summary

The discoveries made in recent years in small collision systems have challenged two paradigms, the
modelling of heavy-ion collisions, as well as the modelling of the underlying event of elementary pp
collisions. The experimental observations of strangeness enhancement and multi-particle correlations
suggests that energy loss should also be present, as both are a consequence of signiﬁcant ﬁnal-state
interactions. But up to this point no hint of energy loss in pp or p–Pb collisions has been seen. The
increased luminosity will allow both for precision studies of the established signatures of small system
collectivity, and to either establish evidence or place exclusion limits on the latter.

This chapter has presented a HL-LHC small system experimental program promising signiﬁcant
progress shown by the set of performance studies, ranging from largely non-ﬂow suppressed high-order
correlations, over measurement of strange-particle yields and thermal radiation, to energy-loss signals.
In addition, new theoretical insights and phenomenological developments are also needed for developing
a uniﬁed picture of parton dynamics and particle production valid for both small and large systems. This
working group encourages both investment in the necessary theoretical development, and facilitation of
collaboration between theorists and experimentalists.

The physics community can look forward to a deepened understanding of hot and dense QCD and

a universal description of small to large collision systems.

Introduction

Proton-nucleus [17] and ultraperipheral (UPC) [583] collisions offer the opportunity to study the be-
haviour of QCD at high energies and large partonic densities [780]. As the theory of the strong interac-
tion, QCD is analytically well understood only in a perturbative regime of small coupling constant and
where radiation of gluons and quarks is a linear process that can be described with linear evolution equa-
tions of the non-perturbative parton densities, i.e., hadrons and nuclei are considered as dilute partonic
objects. However, non-linear effects are unavoidable in QCD, and they should in principle dominate at
large densities reached at high collision energies and for large nuclei. It was proposed long ago [781,782]
that at such large densities a resummation of powers of density scaled by the strong coupling constant is
possible, resulting in a non-perturbative but weak coupling regime where parton densities saturate, and
whose effective ﬁeld theory incarnation is the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) [783]. Particle production
in p–A collisions in the forward rapidity region is dominated by small
x partons in the nucleus. There-
fore, saturation effects are expected to be largest there. Furthermore, UPCs as a source of large ﬂuxes
of quasi-real photons, provide the opportunity to study the partonic structure of protons (in pp and p–A)
and nuclei (in p–A and A–A).

−

The structure of nucleons and nuclei, and the mechanism of particle production at small x, are
also key ingredients for a detailed description of heavy-ion collisions and for the characterisation of the
produced hot and dense medium. For hard probes, the nuclear modiﬁcation of standard collinear parton
densities is one of the uncertainties in the extraction of medium characteristics [260, 381]. For soft and
semihard observables, both the parton densities and the detailed transverse spatial structure of nucleons
and nuclei are crucial ingredients for their description, e.g. for the initial conditions for hydrodynamical
evolution [211, 212, 784].

In the collinear framework, parton densities inside nuclei (nPDFs) [785, 786] are poorly con-
strained due to two primary factors. On the one hand, data come from a large variety of nuclei and the
number of data points for any of them is very small compared to the proton analysis. In particular, for
the Pb nucleus, there are less than 50 points coming from ﬁxed target Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS)
and Drell-Yan experiments and from p–Pb collisions at the LHC. The ﬁt for a single nucleus is therefore
impossible and the modeling of the A-dependence of the parameters in the initial conditions becomes
mandatory [787, 788]. On the other hand, the kinematic coverage in Q2 and x with existing data is
very small compared to the requirements of present hadronic colliders, see Fig. 78. In spite of the un-
certainties in the applicability of collinear factorisation, scale choices and other theoretical caveats for

nPDFs extraction in hadronic collisions and UPCs, these are the only experimental collision systems
where the nPDFs can be constrained before electron-ion colliders become available. The most up to date
analyses include between 1000 and 2000 data points for 14 nuclei and are performed at next-to-leading
accuracy [787–789], there even exists a ﬁrst attempt at next-to-next-to-leading [790]. Differences be-
tween them mainly arise from the different sets of data included in the analysis and from the different
functional forms employed for the initial conditions. All in all, all parton species are very weakly con-
2, gluons at large x > 0.2, and the ﬂavour decomposition is largely unknown
strained at small x < 10−
- a natural fact for u and d due to the approximate isospin symmetry in nuclei. The impact of presently
available LHC data, studied in [787], is quite modest with some constrains on the gluon in the region
0.01 < x < 0.3. On the other hand, theoretical predictions for nuclear shadowing of quark and gluon
4 –
PDFs based on s-channel unitarity and diffractive nucleon PDFs are available down to x

∼

In the context of phenomena beyond collinear factorisation and PDF evolution in ln(Q2), there
have been recent claims [793, 794] that resummation of logarithms of x may be required for a better
description of DIS data from HERA at small x, and searches for long range azimuthal correlations are
undergoing [795]. But no conclusive evidence of saturation, i.e., of non-linear dynamics, has been found
in hadronic collisions. While the CGC provides a calculational framework for several observables in
pp, p–A and A–A, see e.g. the reviews [796, 797], like the ridge, back-to-back hadron correlations in
the forward region, multiplicities and transverse momentum distributions,. . . , there is no consensus in
the ﬁeld in the interpretation of these results, or they involve non-perturbative modeling, or they are
affected by large theoretical uncertainties and, for some of them, higher-order calculations are missing,
or the data lie at the border of phase space where extracting clear conclusions is very delicate. Therefore,
high-energy p–A collisions and UPCs are two promising systems where data can offer clear evidences
of non-linear effects.

In Fig. 78, the kinematic regions covered by proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC and the FCC (the
left panel, [407]) and UPCs at the LHC (right) are shown and compared with the regions where data
currently used to constrain nPDFs lie. A huge enlargement is evident with respect to the presently
existing data at the LHC. The HL-LHC offers new improved detectors and larger statistics for some
observables like dijets or photon-jet correlations. The HE-LHC would enlarge the kinematic plane in a
region intermediate between the LHC and the FCC. On the other hand, electron-nucleus collisions [798,

They offer measurements in a
cleaner experimental environment (no pileup, full kinematic reconstruction) and under better theoretical
control as ﬁrst-principle calculations are easier in DIS albeit in a more restricted kinematical region. The
comparison between the kinematic regions covered by the LHC and Future Circular Collider (FCC) in
p–A mode, and the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) [799] (10-20 GeVelectrons combined with the RHIC
nuclear beams or with a new hadron machine at Jefferson Lab) and the LHeC [798] (60 GeVelectrons
colliding with the HL-LHC, HE-LHC or FCC nuclear beams) is shown in Fig. 78 (left).

10.2 The physics of ultra-peripheral collisions

Ultra-peripheral collisions are interactions with impact parameter larger than the radial size of the collid-
ing nuclei or protons. In these collisions, one nucleus acts as a source of quasi-real photons that interact
with the crossing nucleus or proton. The electromagnetic ﬁeld intensity and hence the photon ﬂux scales
with the charge number squared. At the LHC, these collisions occur abundantly and serve as a labora-
tory for strong and electromagnetic interactions [583]. After an experimental overview discussing the
opportunities, the discussion focuses on vector meson production studies to probe nuclear gluons and
dijet production in photonuclear or photon-proton interactions in LHC Run 3 and 4 as a direct access
of nPDFs. A dedicated section 11.2 addresses the physics of γγ interactions as a probe of QED and
beyond the standard model physics. The investigation of γ-proton interactions in pp collision allowed
interesting measurements on vector meson production by LHCb [800–803] and will allow for interesting
measurements with already recorded and future data. This possibility will not be discussed in detail
because the standard running conditions in terms of pile-up and beam optics relevant for forward proton
tagging in ATLAS/CMS and the pile-up in LHCb in Run 3 and Run 4 will make comparatively low Q2
measurements primarily discussed here challenging and likely restricted to short special runs whereas in
ALICE, the equivalent luminosity γ-proton luminosity will be smaller or similar than in p–Pb collisions
but with the ambiguity which beam emitted the photon.

10.2.1 Experimental overview

An overview of the detector capabilities in Run 3 and Run 4 is given by the four collaborations AL-
ICE,ATLAS,CMS and LHCb in the following. Subsequently, the expected statistics for vector meson
observables is given in Tab. 13,14,15 followed by an estimate of the available precision for coherent
heavy vector meson production and the theoretical assessment of vector mesons and dijet production in
UPCs.

– ALICE [2] will take data in both in triggered and in continuous readout mode during Run 3
and Run 4 [70]. Using continuous readout [69] essentially the full delivered luminosity can be
integrated without signiﬁcant trigger and dead-time inefﬁciencies. Therefore the total acceptance-
efﬁciency factor for UPC events is signiﬁcantly larger than in LHC Runs 1 and 2; it is deter-
mined by the tracking efﬁciencies and the geometrical acceptances of the Inner Tracking System
(ITS) [3], of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [68], and of the Muon Spectrometer [804].
The geometrical acceptances of these detectors correspond to the narrow central and forward ac-
ceptances deﬁned in Tab. 12. Vector meson yields in the corresponding acceptance are given in
Tab. 13,14,15. Final-state neutron emission in UPC events can be detected by the zero-degree
calorimeters (ZDC) which will also take data in continuous readout mode, and vetoes can be im-
posed using the fast interaction trigger detector (FIT).

– ATLAS UPC measurements in Run 3 and Run 4 will continue to be an important part of the
experiments heavy-ion programme and will beneﬁt from several detector upgrades in that period.
Prior to Run 3, the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC), which is key for UPC event identiﬁcation by
measuring forward neutrons, will be upgraded. At mid-rapidity, the Inner Tracker (ITk) upgrade
< 4 for Run 4. The High Granularity
[264] will increase the acceptance for charged particles to

Timing Detector (HGTD) [265] will complement the spatial information of the ITk with timing
information in the region 2.4 < η <4.0, with a resolution of 30 ps. In addition, upgrades to the
ATLAS trigger and data-acquisition system will take place prior to both Run 3 and Run 4 [805],
and will enable advanced triggering capabilities. Together these will aid the study of low-mass
resonances and the continuum as well as jets in UPC events.

– CMS UPC studies will beneﬁt from the upgraded inner tracker for Run 4 which will provide a
< 4 [453]. The improved CMS level-1 trigger
large acceptance for charged particles up to

and data acquisition rate (up to 60 GB/s) will provide opportunities for more innovative and so-
phisticated triggers to capture a wide variety of processes. In addition, the proposed MIP Timing
Detector [806], which is around 1.16 m away from the beam pipe could provide a time resolu-
tion around 30 ps. By combining it with other detectors, MIP will provide proton, pion, and kaon
separation for pT values between 0.7 to 2 GeV/cin the midrapidity region (
< 1.5). These de-

tector upgrades and the increased trigger performance summarised in [807] will facilitate the study
low-mass UPC resonant states and UPC heavy ﬂavour studies. In addition, the reconstruction al-
gorithms will be improved with the addition of the four-layer pixel system. The CMS-acceptance
in Run 3 corresponds to the wide central range deﬁned in Tab. 12. Yields in acceptance for vector

– LHCb is well suited for exclusive production studies in ultra-peripheral collisions. In particular, its
optimisation for ﬂavour physics within its acceptance 2< η <5 provides an excellent resolution for
typical momenta in quarkonium and heavy-ﬂavour exclusive production as demonstrated in Ref.
[808]. Its particle identiﬁcation capabilities allow to measure ﬁnal states with charged muons,
pions, kaons and protons. The upgraded detector will be able to efﬁciently sample the full delivered
luminosity for UPC ﬁnal states based on a purely software based trigger scheme [809]. Exclusive
diphoton analyses as pioneered in ATLAS [810] and CMS [811] are also conceivable with lower
ET-thresholds discussed in Section 11.2. The feasibility of inclusive γ-induced measurements in
LHCb will require further studies. In Tab. 13,14,15 conceivable vector meson ﬁnal states are given
for LHCb represented by the wide forward acceptance deﬁned in Tab. 12.

10.2.2 Vector meson production

10.2.2.1 Experimental reach

The number of vector mesons expected in the upcoming runs provides an estimate of the expected physics
reach. Four toy-model experimental acceptances are shown in Tab. 12. The effects of cuts on the pT of
the ﬁnal state daughter particles are not estimated, because this depends on the analysis and trigger
conditions. In general, for two-prong decays, as long as the minimum detectable pT is less than about
1/4 of the ﬁnal state mass, the effect on the efﬁciency is limited. The acceptance cuts are applied to both
the vector meson rapidity and the daughter particle pseudorapidities. These two selection types have
similar effects on the production phase space, and the results would not be very different without the cut
on the vector meson rapidity.

Table 13 shows the expected cross sections and rates for ﬁve representative vector meson decays,
including the decay branching ratios. The rates are calculated using STARlight [594], which has been
shown to predict the cross sections for all mesons on proton targets and for ρ photoproduction on heavy
targets [812, 813]. Since the ρ vector resonance is broad, the mass range from 2mπ up to Mρ + 5Γρ is
considered. Non-resonant π+π− production is not included which would lead to a 8% increase of the
production rate. The ρ(cid:48) state represents π+π−π+π− states with masses in the range from 4mπ up to
2.5 GeV/c2. In absence of other guidance and the possibility of more complex resonance structure, the
calculation is anchored to the STAR measurement of the π+π−π+π− ﬁnal state in Au–Au collisions at
√sNN = 200 Gev [814] and uses STARlight to extrapolate in collision energy and collision system.

Since STARlight does not include nuclear shadowing, a rapidity-dependent nuclear shadowing

131

correction following Ref. [815] for the heavy quarkonium (J/ψ, ψ(2S) and Υ(1S) was applied. The
cross sections and rates are hence reduced by factors of 0.42, 0.475 and 0.77 for the J/ψ, ψ(2S) and
Υ(1S) respectively.

The rates for light mesons are very large, enough to support billion-event samples of the ρ and
ρ(cid:48), and hundreds of millions of φ, allowing the studies discussed below. Beyond precise cross section
measurements detailed below, the rates for J/ψ, ψ(2S) and Υ(1S) should allow tomographic measure-

The exploration of double vector mesons photoproduction by a single ion-ion pair by exchange
of two independent photons becomes available. The expected ratio of ρρ photoproduction to single ρ
photoproduction is about 1 : 600 while the predicted ratio of ρJ/ψ to ρ is about 1 : 160 [816]. These
events should display signiﬁcant quantum correlations.

In p–Pb collisions, the per-nucleon centre-of-mass system is boosted by 0.465 units of rapidity
from the lab frame, and there are two possible directions for the beams, protons from the +z direction,
or from the
z direction inﬂuencing strongly the available kinematics for the forward detectors. Fur-
thermore, there are two possibilities for the photon emitter, ’lead-shine’ (γp), the photon from the lead

nucleus, or ’proton-shine’ (γPb), the photon from the proton. These two vector meson production chan-
nels can be in principle separated by their different pT scale corresponding to (cid:126)/Rproton for ’lead-shine’
(γp) and (cid:126)/RPb for ’proton-shine’ (γPb). The rates are calculated for these two possibilities in separate
tables.

The total p–Pb luminosity of 2000 nb−

1 assumed to be equally divided between the two possible
proton beam directions. For the asymmetric (around y = 0) detectors, these two Runs are considered
separately, listing them as ’forward’ (in the proton-going hemisphere) and ’backward’ (in the lead-going
hemisphere).

Tables 14 and 15 show the cross sections and rates for the lead-shine and proton-shine cases
respectively. Lead-shine is dominant, with proton-shine contributing less than 10% to the total rate. The
extraction of the proton-shine component by ﬁtting to the different pT spectra for proton-shine and lead-
shine will be challenging and the measurement precision depends strongly of the momentum resolution
of the detector. Nuclear shadowing corrections are not applied, the reduction factors are similar for the
proton-shine cross sections as for the lead-lead collisions. No attempt to calculate the rates for the ρ(cid:48) on
proton targets is undertaken due to the large rate uncertainties.

In case of coherent heavy vector meson production in UPC of lead nuclei, the expected experimen-

gree Calorimeters [817]. Measurement of σ0N0N(y) (no neutrons on both sides) and σ0NXN(y) (at least

Under the assumption that the coherent photoproduction cross section is proportional to the squared

suppression factor can be used to constrain nuclear shadowing at different scales Q. The theoretical
discussion is given in the following Section 10.2.2.2.

The ALICE and CMS collaborations estimate that the uncertainties on luminosity (4%), refer-

ence cross section (5%) and photon ﬂux (5%) result in
4% uncertainty on the nuclear suppression factor RPb(x). Detailed informa-

projections for the nuclear suppression factor are shown in Fig. 79 at different scales corresponding to
J/ψ, ψ(2S) and Υ(1S) photoproduction measurements demonstrating that precision measurements with
a range of different scales become available.

10.2.2.2 Coherent vector meson production off nuclei

Extensive data were produced in the previous LHC heavy ion Runs on coherent photoproduction of ρ
V +A. Due to the presence
mesons [812], J/ψ [819,820,822] and to a lesser extent ψ(2S) [821]: γ+A
of two photon sources, the x-range of these studies is largely limited to x
mV /√s. For light mesons
these measurements provide information on the pattern of interactions of extended pion-size mesons and
such phenomena as shadowing and color ﬂuctuations. For small dipoles like J/ψ and Υ(1S), it provided
information on the leading twist nuclear shadowing at moderate Q2, which is difﬁcult to obtain using
other hard probes. The measured factor of
3 reduction of the J/ψ cross section compared to the γp
case has signiﬁcantly constrained the gluon distribution in leading twist approaches [818, 823–825]. In
the dipole model framework, e.g., [826, 827], have had a tendency to predict less supression than seen in
the data (in this case, the shape and normalisation of the rapidity distribution rather strongly depends on
the form of the dipole cross section and charmonium wave function). The gluon nuclear shadowing in

the method described in Ref. [818].

coherent J/ψ photoproduction in UPCs was also studied in the kt-factorization approach [828] in terms
of the unintegrated nuclear gluon distribution, which determines the initial condition for the non-linear
evolution equation. In the case of ρ meson production, shadowing is a factor of
2 stronger [829] than
in the approach based on the Glauber model and the vector meson dominance model.

many of the trigger-based constraints that have limited UPC data collection, allowing for high-efﬁciency
collection of large samples of photoproduced light mesons. The increases in sample sizes should be
considerably larger than one would expect from merely scaling the luminosity.

In order to conclude this section on the opportunities with vector meson production, we want to
give a list of not yet exploited measurements that provide further insight into photonuclear interactions
with heavy, light and multiple vector meson production:

– Extend substantially the x range for coherent J/ψ photoproduction on nuclei using information on
the impact parameter distribution in peripheral and ultra-peripheral collisions provided by forward
neutron production [817]. The impact parameter distribution can be accessed in the context of
UPCs by exploiting the properties of additional photon or hadronic interactions in addition to the
photon that produces the vector meson. The rates for the combined processed can be found in [831]
and the relationship between impact parameter and additional photon interactions is discussed
in [832]. The x-range can be also extended by using p–A collisions to probe the nucleus. In the
latter case, one would have to separate coherent J/ψ production in γA and γp using a much more
narrow pT distribution of J/ψ produced in coherent γA scattering and very good pT resolution for
the transverse momentum of the pair (LHCb).

– Measure with high enough statistics coherent Υ(1S) production in γp and γA scattering to check
the expectation of the 20% reduction of the coherent cross section, which would allow one to probe
gluon shadowing at a factor of

10 higher Q2 than in J/ψ production.

– Study coherent production of two pions with masses above 1 GeV/c2to study an interplay of soft

∼

and hard dynamics as a function of Mππ and pT(π).

– Measure the production of heavier 2π [833], 4π and other resonances on ion targets, and search
for the photoproduction of the observed exotic mesons. By using data from both proton targets (at

and the meson-nucleon interaction cross sections.

– Study the photoproduction of multiple vector mesons by a single ion pair [816]. Double photopro-
duction introduces many quantum correlations, including the possibility of observing stimulated
decays of vector mesons. Since the two photons share the same linear polarisation, it will be
possible to study photoproduction with polarised photons. In the discussed process, the charged
particles from the vector meson decays are aligned (as cos2(θ)) with the plane of the linear polar-
ization. If the two vector mesons are aligned along the same plane, then the planes formed by the
decay particles will be correlated [832].

10.2.2.3 Nuclear imaging with coherent photoproduction

·

In coherent photoproduction, production amplitudes from each individual scattering site add with a phase
(cid:126)k), where (cid:126)x is the location within the nucleus and (cid:126)k is the momentum transfer from
factor exp i((cid:126)x
the nucleus to the vector meson. So, one can Fourier transform the coherent photoproduction cross
section, dσcoherent/dt to ﬁnd the location of the scattering sites within the nucleus. This can provide
information on the spatial dependence of nuclear shadowing, allowing us to compare shadowing in the
centre of nuclei vs. shadowing in the periphery through the transverse proﬁle F (b). Assuming azimuthal

This calculation is data-hungry, and is subject to a number of theoretical uncertainties. It is also
necessary to separate the cross section into its coherent and incoherent components. Nevertheless, the
STAR Collaboration applied it to ρ0 photoproduction in UPCs [836], ﬁnding a relatively boxy shape,
inconsistent with a Woods-Saxon distribution, but seemingly consistent with expectations from nuclear
shadowing. A follow-on study explored the Q2 evolution of this transverse distribution by dividing
the sample into three bins with different dipion mass [837]. That study also considered some of the
uncertainties inherent in the analysis, including the ﬁnite experimental reach in pT and the effects of the
photon pT, and the impact of the vector meson wave function.

Studies at the LHC could avoid many of these issues, by triggering on exclusive vector mesons
(STAR required that the vector mesons be accompanied by neutrons from mutual Coulomb excitation).
This would expand the pT range where a meaningful dσcoherent/dt can be extracted, increasing the
accuracy of the transform. Also, because of the higher beam energies, the photon pT is less important
than it is at RHIC. More importantly, LHC Run 3 and 4 could also extend this study to a wider variety of
mesons, including the ρ(cid:48) (generically, 4π ﬁnal states with a mass in the 1-2 GeV/c2range) and the J/ψ.
The latter is of particular interest because it is heavy enough to probe gluon shadowing, rather than just
nuclear shadowing.

10.2.2.4

Incoherent vector meson production off nuclei

Incoherent diffractive processes provide information on nuclear dynamics, which is complementary to
the information one can obtain from coherent scattering. In particular, incoherent J/ψ photoproduction
probes quantum ﬂuctuations of the target gluon density [838–843]. The corresponding cross section can
be measured in a much larger range of WγN than in the coherent case. This is possible since the activity
in the nucleus fragmentation region, for example, neutrons in a ZDC can be used to determine which of
two nuclei was a source of photons almost in each event.

One can distinguish two contributions to incoherent diffraction: quasielastic, when the nucleus
involved in the strong interaction breaks down into nucleons and nuclear fragments, and inelastic, when

136

∼
inelastic mechanism is weaker, it dominates the nuclear incoherent cross section for

hadrons are produced in the nucleus fragmentation region. At small t the second mechanism gives a
20% contribution to the incoherent cross section [838, 844]. However, since the t-dependence of the
0.5 GeV/c2.
While it is generally understood and accepted that J/ψ photoproduction with target dissociation
is sensitive to ﬂuctuations of the gluon density of the target, practical realisations of this notion require
modeling. Notably, proton size ﬂuctuations at t = 0 [838] should be contrasted with proton shape
ﬂuctuations [839–841], which in turn can be reﬁned by including ﬂuctuations of number of subnucleonic
degrees of freedoms representing regions of high-gluon density, so-called hot spots [842,843]. The latter
two approaches are assumed to be valid in an entire range of
. Hence, studies of incoherent diffraction

Inclusive and diffractive dijet production in UPC

Ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions provide an opportunity to study nuclear modiﬁcations of the PDFs
in clean photon-nucleus interactions. One possible observable is dijet production as suggested in Ref. [847].
Compared to the dijet production in p–Pb collisions the photo-nuclear events have less underlying event
activity since multiparton interactions are signiﬁcantly suppressed. This enables jet reconstruction at
lower transverse momenta allowing to study nPDFs at smaller scales Q2 and x where the current PDF
uncertainties are more pronounced. As the virtuality of the photons emitted by the nucleus is negligible,
there are two components that need to be taken into account: the photons may interact as unresolved
particles or the quasi-real photons may ﬂuctuate into a hadronic state described with photon PDFs. The
relative contribution of the direct and resolved components depends on the kinematics of the ﬁnal state
jets. Hence, the uncertainty related to weakly-constrained photon PDFs can be reduced by focusing on
the region where direct processes dominate the dijet production.

Here, the photoproduction framework is applied which has been recently implemented into the
PYTHIA 8 Monte-Carlo event generator [512] and validated against HERA data [848], to study the
potential of the Run 3 and Run 4 program to constrain nPDFs using photo-nuclear dijets. The relevant
part of the photon ﬂux is obtained by integrating the impact-parameter dependent ﬂux from bmin =
13.27 fm. Two different jet kinematics are considered, one corresponding to the preliminary

ATLAS measurement [849] with plead
T > 20 GeV/c and mjets > 35 GeV/c2and one similar to HERA
dijet photoproduction data [850, 851] with plead
T > 8 GeV/c and mjets > 14 GeV/c2. In both cases the
jets were reconstructed from the generated events using the anti-kT algorithm with R = 0.4 implemented
in the FASTJET package [405]. The differential cross sections are shown as a function of xA in Fig. 80

Note that in a leading-order (LO) parton-level calculation, the deﬁnitions of xA and zγ would exactly
match the momentum fractions probed in the PDFs of the nucleus and the photon. The parton-shower
emissions and MPIs, and NLO corrections considered below, smear this connection but xA and zγ do
serve as rather precise hadron-level estimators for the momentum fractions [853].

The uncertainty bands are derived from the EPPS16 error sets and reﬂect the uncertainties in the
current nPDF analyses which are compared to the expected statistical uncertainties of the data in the ratio.
Also the contributions from direct and resolved processes are separately plotted. Furthermore, results
with the default CJKL photon PDFs [854] are compared to GRV [855] and SASGAM [856] analyses to
study the underlying photon PDF uncertainty.

As shown in Figure 80(left), the contribution from resolved processes becomes dominant around
xA > 0.02 for plead
T > 20 GeV/c. This leads to a more pronounced dependence on the photon PDFs in
this region, partly hindering the use of the data from this region in a global nPDF analysis. However, at
small-x region, where the nPDF uncertainties are currently large and the dijets in p–Pb do not provide
additional constraints, the direct processes dominate the dijet production and the dependence on the
photon PDFs is negligible. The dijet cross sections fall off rapidly at small-xA region which increases
the expected statistical uncertainty limiting the small-xA reach of the observable. With an integrated

are probed at smaller scales. The theoretical uncertainty related to the limited precision of the photon
PDFs could be reduced by performing a similar measurement in p–Pb collisions where the photon ﬂux
would be dominantly provided by the Pb ion and the jets produced by γ-p system without any nuclear
modiﬁcations. This measurement would constrain also the uncertainty related to the impact-parameter
rejection that removes the events with hadronic interactions. However, as the minimum allowed impact
parameter is smaller in case of p–Pb compared to Pb–Pb and the spectrum of photons is correlated with
the impact parameter cut, the kinematics would not be fully comparable preventing a full calibration of
the photon ﬂux. As the nPDFs mainly vary the shape of the xA distributions, part of the theoretical and
experimental uncertainties could also be reduced by considering xA distributions normalized with the
integrated cross section.

processes, in which the photon radiates before it interacts with the target gluon [860]. This process type
is a subset of ﬂavour untagged dijets, discussed above. However, open charm and bottom offer some
advantages, including very high rates. Based on the leading order calculations in Ref. [860] with the
EKS nPDF [862], a total number of 22 billion (10 million) cc (bb) pairs are produced in γPb interactions
1 PbPb data set at √sN N =5.5 TeV. In pPb collisions at √sN N =8.8 TeV with a luminosity of
in a 13 nb−
1, 18 billion (100 million) cc (bb) pairs are produced. The measurement of both of these processes
2 pb−
should be well feasible despite the small experimental acceptances and branching ratios.

Vertex detectors can detect separated vertices from charm production if the charm is moderately
relativistic [863], so it should be possible to study pairs with an invariant mass of Mcc ≈
4mc ≈
6 GeV/c2. This will enable to study gluon distributions down to Bjorken
≈
MQQ/(4γmp) exp(y), where the relativistic boost of the nucleus γ, the rapidity y of the QQ and
the proton mass mp appear. The corresponding scale is Q2
MQQ. Assuming scales down to

in the preliminary inclusive dijet ATLAS analysis [849] for which the Bjorken-x reach is depicted in

A–A collisions), it is possible to make a direct measurement of nuclear shadowing.

The clear experimental signature for this process consists of a pair of separated vertices each
corresponding to a D-meson decay in an event with one large rapidity gap. The ion moving in the same
direction as the rapidity gap should remain intact. The full reconstruction of both D-mesons, the cleanest
channel, the in speciﬁc decay channels requires large large event statistics and might be complemented
by an analysis with one D-meson decaying semileptonically. However, the charm production rates are
high enough that the low efﬁciency should be affordable for a precise measurement.

In addition to charm and bottom, it may also be possible to study the photoproduction of top
1), but for pPb
[864, 865]. The rates are small for lead-lead collisions at the LHC (7 pairs in 13 nb−
1
collisions at √sN N =8.8 TeV, the calculation of Ref. [864] ﬁnds that an integrated luminosity of 2 pb−
corresponds to a production of 110 pairs. These pairs are mostly at fairly central rapidities and the large
top semileptonic branching ratio should provide a clear experimental tag. This process could provide
a separate probe of gluon distributions at larger x, and very high Q2.
It would also allow a direct
measurement of the electric charge of the top quark.

10.3 The physics of inelastic p-Pb collisions

10.3.1 Experimental overview

Proton-lead collisions are an integral part of the LHC program since the 2012 pilot run. Within collinear
factorisation, constraints on our knowledge of the nuclear wave functions could be extended at high Q2
by dijets and heavy gauge boson available for the ﬁrst time in nuclear collisions [787]. Insights have been
gained at lower Q2 with heavy-ﬂavour production based on the assumption that their nuclear production
modiﬁcation is dominated by nPDFs [325]. In Run 3 and 4, the increased luminosities and detector
upgrades will allow to improve the statistical precision, to extent the kinematic reach and the available
processes. The detector capabilities and observables are outlined in view of high-energy QCD studies
in p–Pb collisions and experimental measurement projections on selected observables are shown. One
upgrade dedicated to low-x physics is separately discussed. In all cases, the statistical and point-by-
point uncorrelated systematic uncertainties are not taking into account to place the central point. After

140

this introduction, two theory contributions zoom in on speciﬁc aspects of Run 3-4 data.

– ALICE will measure heavy ﬂavour and charged particle production at mid-rapidity in p–Pb col-
lisions during Run 3 and Run 4. These measurements will constrain the parton densities in the
nucleus at moderate x. At forward and backward rapidity, measurements of W and Z-boson pro-
duction, as well as a range of quarkonia (J/ψ, ψ(2S), and the Υ(nS) family) will be performed. In
particular the W and Z boson measurements will constrain the nuclear PDFs, while the quarkonia
are also sensitive to ﬁnal state effects. An example is given for the Z boson in Fig. 83 on the right.
– ATLAS will measure heavy electro-weak bosons, W and Z, with the larger p–Pb dataset which
will be available in Run 3-4. The much larger luminosity will allow precision in these measure-
ments signiﬁcantly surpassing the one currently available. Projected W and Z boson cross sections
published in Ref. [7] are shown in Figure 81. Previous results have suggested that the modiﬁcation
of EW boson cross sections that is described with nPDFs, appears to be stronger in more central
collisions [866, 867]. Figure 82 (left) shows the projected boson yield ratio of central to peripheral
collisions, RCP, for different centrality bins from Ref. [7]. Figure 82(right) shows the yield of Z
bosons scaled by the nuclear overlap function, TAB, as a function of centrality. It indicates that the
Z boson yield uncertainties will be considerably smaller than the TAB uncertainty.

– CMS will exploit the larger p–Pb dataset available during Run 3–4 and it will hence further im-
prove the precision on differential measurements of W and Z bosons (constraining quark and anti-
quark nPDFs) [868, 869], as well as dijet and top quark pair (tt) production (gluon nPDFs) [870,
871]. While ﬁrst Run 2 results on W boson production already feature experimental uncertainties
smaller than the nPDF ones [872], the larger luminosity by a factor 5 to 10 expected in Runs 3–4
will allow for another large jump in the constraints on nPDFs from data. The CMS dijet capabilities
with Run 3–4 data [12] are shown in Fig. 84. In addition, novel studies will become possible, such
as the measurement of differential cross sections for tt production, for an improved constraining
power on nPDFs, as well as the mass dependence of Drell-Yan production down to the Υ meson
mass region. The projection for tt production [12] is shown together with the precise W boson
asymmetry measurement in Run 3–4 [8] in Fig. 85. Heavy ﬂavour meson cross sections will also
be measured, which are sensitive to low-x gluon nPDFs: D mesons (pT > 0.5 GeV/c), B mesons
(pT > 5 GeV/c), prompt and non-prompt J/ψ (pT > 3 GeV/c), and Υ(nS) down to pT = 0. These
measurements will beneﬁt from the improved detector and trigger performance in Run 4 [807].
– LHCb will operate during Run 3 and Run 4 with the average charged particle multiplicity in p–Pb
and Pb–p collisions that are smaller than the nominal conditions in pp running with an average
pile-up of 5 interactions. All p–Pb collisions will be processed in the software trigger. Hence,
LHCb can fully proﬁt from the luminosity increase including pT = 0 heavy-ﬂavour production.
A natural focus is the study of open and hidden beauty and charm production with improved
precision. A novel measurement in the p–Pb collision system is discussed in detail in view of
saturation physics in section 10.3.3 and is shown in Fig. 87. A new focus of LHCb, proﬁtting from
the increased ion in one of the considered rapidity range is shown in Fig. 83 down to 5 GeV/c2.
Direct photon studies in the conversion channel will strongly proﬁt from the increased luminosity.
The projections of the LHCb collaboration for p–Pb collisions are discussed in detail in Ref. [13].

10.3.2 Forward calorimeter upgrade of ALICE

The ALICE collaboration is considering to add a high-granularity forward calorimeter (FOCAL) to the
experiment to measure direct photon production in the rapidity range 3.0–5.0 and at low pT, to probe
5 where gluon saturation and non-linear effects in the
the gluon density in protons and nuclei at x
gluon density may become apparent. The FOCAL design is based on the Si-W calorimeter technology,
with two or three high-granularity layers with silicon pixel sensors that allow to separate electromagnetic
showers with only a few mm distance between them. This unique high granularity makes it possible to

Future measurements of Drell-Yan production in LHCb, as shown in Fig. 91, will also probe this re-
gion, but will have a weaker impact for gluons at small Q2 according to current experimental uncertainty
estimates.

In addition to the inclusive direct photon measurement, the FOCAL program will measure forward
π0 production in pp, p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions, which also provides important constraints for the
nuclear PDFs and parton energy loss in Pb–Pb collisions at large rapidity. Correlation measurements
of neutral pions and photons will be used to further probe the gluon density and to search for evidence
of multiple-gluon interactions which are expected to be important in the high gluon density of the Color

10.3.3 Transverse momentum dependent and low-x phenomena sensitive observables in c¯c and b¯b

production

In recent years, many efforts have been devoted to elucidate the properties of transverse-momentum-
dependent gluon distributions in the high-energy or small-x limit, and in particular to determine how
non-linear saturation effects impact the various distributions. A process which is particularly interesting
in this regard is the forward production of a heavy quark-antiquark pair, in high-energy proton-proton
or proton-nucleus collisions. For kinematical reasons, in the proton-nucleus case, the proton side of
the collision involves large-x partons, while on the nucleus side, small-x gluons participate. Hence,
this process can be described in a hybrid approach in which the proton content is described by regu-
lar, integrated PDFs, while the small-x dynamics in the nuclear wave function is dealt with using the
Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective theory, from which the gluon transverse momentum dependent
distributions (TMDs) naturally emerge [881, 882].

In terms of sensitivity to the QCD saturation regime, the same manifestations are expected than
with light quarks [883], although smaller values of x can be reached in the latter case. From the point
of view of the TMD content however, heavy quarks are interesting because their production involves
linearly-polarized gluons TMDs [884], in addition to the usual unpolarized gluon TMDs, and because,
due to non-linear effects, the linearly-polarized TMDs generally differ from their unpolarized part-
ners [885]. The LHCb detector is well-suited to measure heavy hadrons in the forward rapidity region,
and given large-enough statistics, one could potentially try and extract information about the linearly-
polarized gluons in protons and lead nuclei, from data obtained with LHC unpolarized beams. Before
giving cross section estimates, let us brieﬂy give a bit more details about the process and the physics
involved.

Forward quark-antiquark pair production in dilute-dense collisions is characterized by three mo-
mentum scales: Pt, the typical transverse momentum of a single quark, and always one of the largest
scales; kt, the total transverse momentum of the pair, which is a measure of the transverse momentum
of the small-x gluons coming from the target; and Qs, the saturation scale of the target, which is always
one of the softest scales. The value of kt with respect to Qs and Pt governs which factorisation scheme
Pt (the quark and the antiquark are almost back-to-back), there are
is relevant. Indeed, when kt ∼
effectively two strongly ordered scales kt and Pt in the problem and TMD factorisation applies [881],
implying the involvement of several gluon TMDs that differ signiﬁcantly from each other, especially in
Qs [882]. In the other regime which shall not be discussed here (away

the linear small-x dynamics is important and the various TMDs differ no more.

In [881, 886], the cross section for forward di-jet production in proton-nucleus collisions was cal-
culated within the CGC. It was then shown that, in the back-to-back limit, a TMD factorisation formula
could be extracted, the result being the same as in a direct TMD approach (i.e., without resorting to the
CGC). However, in contrast to the direct TMD approach, the calculation in the CGC yields explicit ex-
pressions for the TMDs in terms of Wilson lines, which can be evolved in rapidity through the nonlinear
Jalilian-Marian-Iancu-McLerran-Weigert-Leonidov-Kovner (JIMWLK) equation. In [885], those results
were extended to the case of a forward heavy quark-antiquark pair. As already observed earlier (see
for instance [884, 887–891]), by keeping a non-zero quark mass, the cross section becomes sensitive to
additional TMDs, which describe the linearly-polarized gluon content of the unpolarized target.

The three unpolarized gluon TMDs which describe the quark-antiquark pair production are the
adjoint-dipole TMD, the Weizsäcker-Williams TMD, and a third one which is roughly a convolution
of two fundamental-dipole TMDs. They are accompanied by three ‘polarized’ partners, which couple
through the quark mass and via azimuthal-angle modulation. This is analogous to what happens in the
q ¯q process (in that case not only a non-zero quark mass but also a non-zero photon virtuality
γ∗A
brings sensitivity to linearly-polarized gluons) described in Section 10.2.4,10.2.3, although there, only
one unpolarized gluon TMD is involved (the Weizsäcker-Williams distribution), along with its polarized
partner [890, 891].

Predictions for D mesons are presented in Figure 87 as a function of their relative azimuthal
angle near π, along with projections from the LHCb experiment. In the p–Pb kinematical range that is
investigated here, roughly 2.800 raw counts are expected over the full azimuthal range for the speciﬁed
decay channel that can be complemented with other channels as in pp collisions in Ref. [892].

10.3.4 Fully coherent energy loss effects on different ﬁnal states

The multiple scattering of quarks and gluons traveling in a QCD medium induces the radiation of gluons
which carry away some energy of the propagating parton, leading for instance to the jet quenching
phenomenon. Therefore, a key ingredient of any parton energy loss calculation is the medium-induced
gluon spectrum radiated by the fast propagating color charge.
It is of course of crucial importance
to know the correct parametric dependence of the induced spectrum, which in general depends on the
parton properties (in particular its energy and mass) and those of the medium, since it has a direct impact
on the phenomenology of particle production in p–A and A–A collisions. The emission of a gluon
radiated by an energetic parton experiencing multiple scattering in a medium takes a typical formation
time, tf , which needs to be compared to the length of the medium, L.

Over the last few years, it has been realized that in a hard process involving incoming and outgoing
energetic color charges (which do not have to be identical) being quasi-collinear in the rest frame of the
medium, the associated medium-induced gluon spectrum is dominated by large gluon formation times,
L [485, 893, 894]. In this so-called fully coherent (FC) region, the medium-induced radiated
tf (cid:29)
energy is similar to the energy loss of an asymptotic charge. In particular it scales as the energy, and
thus exceeds at high energy the average parton energy loss in the Landau–Pomeranchuk–Migdal (LPM)
(cid:46) L, for which the energy dependence is at most logarithmic. This different parametric
regime, tf
behavior has important consequences on the phenomenology of hadron production in p–A collisions. In
particular, a model based on the fully coherent induced gluon spectrum was shown to describe accurately
the quarkonium suppression observed in p–A collisions at all centre-of-mass energies, from the SPS
ﬁxed-target experiments (√s
20 GeV) to the LHC (√s = 5.02 TeVand √s = 8.16 TeV) [895–897].
It is therefore necessary to investigate further the role of fully coherent energy loss on other processes.
Because the fully coherent induced gluon spectrum arises from the interference between the emission
amplitudes off the initial charge and that off the ﬁnal state, the effects of FC energy loss are process
dependent. Let us review, at a qualitative level, the expected nuclear dependence of different processes

In the absence of color charge in the partonic ﬁnal state, the energy loss in Drell-Yan (DY) pro-
duction at leading order is expected to be that of a suddenly decelerated parton, that is, independent of
its energy (LPM regime). The effects of parton energy loss in nuclei should therefore play almost no
role on DY production in high-energy p–A collisions, since ∆E/E
0 in the high-energy limit. The
inclusive production of DY lepton pairs in p–A collisions at the LHC should therefore be free of any par-
ton energy loss effect. As a result, this process might be used advantageously in order to probe possible
nuclear PDF effects at small values of x, see e.g., Fig. 83 and Ref. [496] for more details. Assuming a
1 and taking the conservative value for the cross section in p–Pb collisions
luminosity of Lint = 250 nb−
at √s = 5 TeV, dσ/dy = 40 nb [496], the number of forward DY lepton pairs, which could be mea-
sured by the LHCb experiment is typically 104 per rapidity unit. Also interesting, and accessible with a
high luminosity, would be the production of diphotons in p–A collisions. This process would be free of
energy loss effects, for the same reasons as the DY process, while being sensitive to nPDF in the quark
sector, q ¯q

γγ, and in the gluon sector through the ‘box diagram’, gg

γγ.

Note that the energy loss scaling as E (FC regime) would come into play only if another energetic
charged particle is produced in the ﬁnal-state in association with the virtual photon (or the diphoton),
such that the ﬁnal state carries a global color charge. Such a situation typically occurs in DY+jet pro-
qγ(cid:63). At forward
duction in p–A collisions. Consider for instance the Compton scattering process, qg
rapidity, an incoming quark from the proton projectile scatters in the medium to produce the ﬁnal state
in a color triplet representation. In this peculiar case of quark to a color triplet ﬁnal state, one would
expect a negative medium-induced gluon spectrum (i.e., with stronger gluon radiation in pp than in p–A
collisions), leading to an energy gain (with respect to pp collisions), ∆E
E [894]. Such
an unusual dependence would manifest by a slight enhancement of DY+jet production in p–A collisions
with respect to pp collisions [496], although a quantitative study would be needed to answer whether this
effect could be visible in the experiment. Similarly, should this enhancement be small or negligible, the
associate production of a prompt photon with a heavy-quark jet might be sensitive to the nPDF of heavy
105 pb in the acceptance of the AL-
quarks and gluons, as emphasized in Ref. [898]. Using σγc = 1.2
105 γ + c-jet events in p–Pb collisions at √s = 8.8 TeV assuming
ICE calorimeter [898] leads to 2.4
1. This observable should be also accessible in ATLAS, CMS and LHCb acceptances as well.
More pronounced effects of fully coherent energy loss are expected when the ﬁnal state is in a color
octet state, or possibly in higher color representations. An example is the production of a jet pair with
not too large transverse momenta (ideally only a few times the saturation scale of the target nucleus). In
the case of di-gluon production, the ﬁnal state can be produced in the 27-plet color representation (with
Casimir C27 = 8) that would lead to an average coherent energy loss proportional to (Nc + C27)/2 =
11/2, that is almost twice larger that expected if the ﬁnal state is in a color octet state. Such higher color
representations could also be probed in the production of Bc mesons (or in the associate production of a D

and a B meson), with a complex ﬁnal state c ¯c b ¯b. From the number of ﬁtted signal candidates

10.4 Constraints on nuclear PDFs

10.4.1 Overview

As previously discussed in Sec. 10.1, the nuclear Parton Distribution Functions (nPDFs) are poorly con-
strained as compared to the proton PDFs. This is mainly due to the lack of high statistics data across the
very large nuclear mass number (A) range. In fact, even the precision of the proton PDFs rely crucially
on nuclear target data [873, 900, 901]; for example, the neutrino-nucleon deep-inelastic-scattering (DIS)
structure functions are essential for decomposing the ﬂavour components of the proton [902–906]. Con-

147

sequently, improved determinations of the nuclear PDFs and nuclear correction factors could improve
the proton PDF precision. Thus, the future LHC Runs 3 and 4 could provide the opportunity to precisely
constrain the nPDFs for the Pb-nucleus and, in Run 5 and later, one or more lighter nuclei, and thereby
disentangle the nuclear effects from the individual ﬂavour components.

In Fig. 88 selected nPDFs from the literature are displayed.

10.4.2 W and Z boson production

Fig. 88: Comparison of the gluon (left) and strange (right) quark nPDF for a lead nucleus as a function of
x for a selection of nuclear PDF sets: HKN07 [907], DSSZ [789], EPPS16 [787], and nCTEQ15 [788].

Inclusive W and Z boson production: Inclusive production of W and Z bosons in pp collisions at the
LHC can provide new information on the strange, charm and beauty quark PDFs. Additionally, heavy-
ion W and Z production data from p–Pb and Pb–Pb can provide insight on the nuclear corrections,
and this complements other data on nuclear targets as it is at large A (lead) and high energy (and thus,
smaller x) [866–869, 872, 911, 912]. For example, ATLAS used inclusive W/Z production data to extract
the strange quark component of the proton as displayed in Fig. 89 (left). This yielded a larger strange
quark PDF than commonly expected [908, 913]. A recent analysis of the ATLAS and CMS inclusive
W and Z differential cross section data at 7 and 8 TeV [914] and the combined HERA inclusive data
indicates that while there is no tension between the data sets, the LHC data does support unsuppressed
strangeness in the proton at low x at both low and high scales. Certainly this is an area that warrants
further study.

To highlight the sensitivity of the heavy ion W/Z production to both the heavy ﬂavour compo-
nents and the nuclear corrections, in Fig. 89 (right), the correlations between W+ and W− cross sections
for proton-lead interactions calculated with different input PDFs and assumptions [909] are shown. By
comparing the results with and without the strange, charm, beauty quark ﬂavours, it can be observed that
these quarks do have a large impact on this observable; hence, this process can provide incisive informa-
tion about the corresponding PDFs. To see the effect of the nuclear corrections, the CT10 proton result is
compared with the other calculations. For the case that only two ﬂavours are considered, the separation
of the proton result (CT10) and the nuclear results are quite distinct. In this case, the effect of the speciﬁc
nuclear correction (nCTEQ15 or EPS09) or the effect of the underling base PDF (CTEQ6.1 or CT10) is
minimal. In contrast, when this picture is compared to the ﬁve ﬂavour results, the division between the
proton and nuclear result is not as simple as the different nuclear corrections and proton baseline PDFs
yield a broader range of results. In particular, the strange quark PDFs in the CTEQ6.1 and CT10 proton
baseline PDFs are quite different, and this will contribute to the spread of results. Thus, proton-lead
production of W/Z is an ideal “laboratory” as this process is sensitive to i) the heavy ﬂavour components,
ii) the nuclear corrections, and iii) the underlying “baseline” proton PDF. Thus, high-statistics heavy-ion
run data during Run 3 and Run 4 has the potential to reduce the current uncertainties and improve the
nuclear PDF determination as illustrated by the projections from ATLAS in Fig. 81 and CMS 85.

W± asymmetries: A way to disentangle the nuclear effects from proton PDF and other theory uncer-
tainties like higher-order corrections even in the absence of a pp reference, is the forward-to-backward
ratio [915]. To showcase the potential in the case of W± projections (shown in Fig. 85), Fig. 90 presents
the effect that PDF reweighting [916] analysis with these data has on EPPS16 nuclear PDFs and the
corresponding theory predictions for the asymmetry. The most notable effect is the dramatic reduction
in the uncertainties of the gluon PDF. Indeed, W± production takes place at a high scale Q2

nantly the gluon component that gets tightly constrained by the W data. The improvement for the light
sea quarks (d,u,s) is merely a consequence of better constrained gluons, through QCD dynamics. The
large-x (x (cid:38) 0.1) part is not really affected by the W± data.

proposed in Ref. [915]. In order to measure such a quantity involving four cross sections and subtrac-
tions among them (particularly in the denominator which may ﬂuctuate between positive and negative),
an excellent statistical precision — like that achievable during Run 3 and 4 at the LHC would be advan-
tageous. With the present Run 2 luminosity it appears that the data [872] are still not accurate enough to
measure this across the full rapidity acceptance.

Low-mass Drell-Yan: The Drell-Yan process at low invariant masses is a luminosity-hungry process
where LHC Run 3 and Run 4 can make a difference. It would be very much advantageous to reach
this low-mass region experimentally as it offers a possibility to constrain the nuclear PDFs at lower
factorisation scale where the nuclear effects are larger. The estimated impact is shown in Fig. 91 where
the LHCb estimates for RpPb are compared to the reduction of EPPS16 uncertainties upon performing a
PDF reweighting [916] with these data described in detail in Ref. [13]. In the calculation, a full decay-
lepton phase space has been assumed, but this has a feeble effect on RpPb. Although the Drell-Yan
process occurs predominantly via qq annihilation, the scale-evolution effects are large and these data
mostly constrain the gluon PDFs. Here, it should be noted that the probed x values are already so
small, that the parametrisation bias which is prominent at small x [874, 917] is probably signiﬁcant and
understates the "true" effect of these measurements. This kind of scan over a wide range of invariant
masses with the LHC Run 3 and 4 precision would offer a possibility to test the Q2 evolution of nuclear
PDFs – whether there are corrections to standard DGLAP – much more systematically than only on-shell
W±- and Z-production measurements do (involving only one scale).

10.4.3 Heavy quark production

Inclusive Heavy Quark Production: A recent study of inclusive heavy quark production in proton–
lead collisions at the LHC demonstrates this can also help constrain the gluon distribution in nuclei.
Speciﬁcally, Ref. [918] makes use of LHC p–Pb data on D0, J/ψ, B
J/ψ, Υ(1S) meson produc-
tion [492, 502, 755, 875, 919–930]. They obtain a consistent description of these data assuming nPDF
modiﬁcations are the dominant source of nuclear modiﬁcations in p–Pb collisions. Under this assump-
tion, a clear conﬁrmation of gluon shadowing at small x is found. Additionally, they demonstrate that

the inclusion of such heavy-ﬂavour data in a global ﬁt can signiﬁcantly reduce the uncertainty on the
6 while keeping an agreement with the other data of the global ﬁts. A
gluon density down to x
reweighting of the current nPDFs sets with the LHC heavy-ﬂavour data was performed for the nCTEQ15
and EPPS16 sets. In a recent analysis of beauty hadrons by the LHCb collaboration [755, 923, 924]
excellent agreement between the reweighted predictions and the measured data for the nuclear modi-
ﬁcation factor RpPb was found. Furthermore, the precision of these data will allow to further reduce
the uncertainty of the low-x nuclear gluon distribution. Due to the lower production rates for beauty
hadrons, this kind of observables would clearly proﬁt from a higher luminosity as shown in Fig. 25 in the
heavy-ﬂavour chapter. Note that heavy ﬂavour measurements from LHCb extending to larger transverse
momenta have also the potential to constrain the intrinsic heavy quark component [931–933].

Prompt Diphoton Production: As discussed in Sec. 10.3.4, other nuclear effects such as coherent small
angle gluon radiation may explain the heavy-ﬂavour data without a strong shadowing of the small-x
gluon. A way to contrast parton shadowing against effects from coherent energy loss discussed in sec-
tion 10.3.4, will be to study hard processes with color neutral ﬁnal states in the context of a global analysis
in order to see whether a coherent description of all the data remains possible. The case of vector boson
production has already been discussed above which is rather sensitive to the quark distributions. Inter-
esting processes (with more or less color neutral ﬁnal states) which are sensitive to the gluon distribution
are inclusive prompt photon production and diphoton production. The prompt photon observable has
been discussed in Section 10.3.2 in the context of the ALICE upgrade. The diphoton production is rather
clean with an essentially color neutral ﬁnal state assuming that the contribution from the fragmentation of
quarks and gluons into photons can be strongly suppressed by photon isolation criteria [726, 934]. Due
to the small diphoton cross section, this measurement requires high luminosities. Based on the avail-
able calculations at next-to-leading order [935, 936], about 6000 events within the ﬁducial experimental
acceptance used in pp collisions by ATLAS can be expected with 2 pb−
Heavy Quark Associated Production: The associated production of a heavy quark Q and a vector
boson γ/Z/W ± also provides incisive information about the PDFs. For all these processes, the LO
contribution comes from the gluon–heavy-quark (gQ) initiated subprocess, making this process very
sensitive to the gluon and the heavy quark nuclear parton densities. For the neutral current processes, a
prompt photon γ or Z together with a c or b quark can be considered to obtain information of the c and
b PDFs, respectively; for the charged current process, the W c and W b ﬁnal states are sensitive to the
strange and charm quark, respectively. These channels have been analysed for the LHC pp data [937–
942] and the W c channel is a key input for the ATLAS/CMS comparison of the strange sea quark content

Additionally, the γ/Z transverse momentum can be used to gauge the initial energy of the mas-
sive parton propagating through the dense QCD medium produced in those collisions, making γ/Z+ Q
production a powerful process in order to probe energy loss dynamics in the heavy-quark sector. Fur-
thermore, the comparison of the photon-jet pair momentum, from pp to Pb–Pb collisions, is sensitive to
the amount of energy lost by the heavy-quarks and could therefore be used in order to better understand
parton energy loss processes in the heavy quark sector.

10.4.4 Top production

The tt production provides a complementary observable to the dijets for probing high-x gluons [871,
943]. For the very short t-quark life time, they decay, in practice exclusively, to W boson and b quarks.
Although, the cleanest channel is the one where both W bosons decay leptonically, it has been recently
demonstrated [871] that it is possible to get a clear signal when one of the two W bosons decays leptoni-
cally and the other one goes to light-quark jets. This is the preferred observable as the yields are 3 times
higher than when both W bosons decay leptonically. The cross sections using the MCFM code [944],

the considered kinematic conﬁguration the expected RpPb is typically a bit above unity for the gluon
antishadowing in EPPS16. As can be seen from the left-hand panel of Fig. 92, the expected precision of
the measurement is not enough to give signiﬁcant constraints on nuclear PDFs. In particular, the dijets
considered in Section 11.4.3 will probe the same kinematic conﬁguration with a clearly higher precision.
However, here much depends on the expected systematic error (taken here to be 5% for each data point
separately) and how large are the bin-to-bin correlations. In the p-Ar mode, the higher c.m. energy of

10.5 Perspectives with lighter ions

Lighter ions, with the possibility to achieve large integrated luminosities in modest running times, see
Sect. 2.4 in the accelerator chapter, offer several interesting opportunities for the study of the initial
stage of ion collisions, for small-x physics and for the determination of nuclear parton densities, see
Section 10.1.

First, concerning nPDFs, it should be noted that due to the scarcity of nuclear data, a PDF ﬁt
or a single nucleus is impossible as discussed in Section 10.1. The different groups [787–789] have
adopted different strategies but, generically, they give the parameters in the initial condition to be ﬁtted
a dependence on the nuclear mass number. Such dependence acquires different functional forms and,
therefore, it constitutes part of the parametrisation bias in the nPDF set. Data on lighter nuclei may help
to constrain such parametrisations, see the discussions for UPCs and p–A collisions in Section 10.4.
To highlight the current unknowns, Fig. 93 compares the nuclear modiﬁcations for Argon and Lead, as
given by the EPPS16 and nCTEQ15 global analyses. In particular, the nCTEQ15 prediction varies, even
qualitatively, quite signiﬁcantly between Argon and Lead. This underscores the usefulness of e.g. a p-Ar
run at the LHC.

On the other hand, the impact parameter dependence of nPDFs is linked to their dependence on
nuclear size. Several models exist (see e.g. [947, 948]), and even less model-dependent approaches
like the EPS09s analysis [949] where the dependence on nuclear size was used to constrain the impact
parameter dependence. First-principle calculations combining the Gribov theory of inelastic shadowing
and factorisation theorems for hard diffraction and DIS relate diffraction in electron-proton collisions
with nuclear shadowing. This has been used to predict nuclear shadowing [791,792], including its nuclear
size and impact parameter dependence. While such relation is exact for the deuteron, its extension

153

RArgxQ2=10GeV2ArRPbgxQ2=10GeV2Pbto larger nuclei has some degree of model dependence. Lighter ions are the ideal place to test the
nuclear size dependence without resorting to centrality selection, whose relation with impact parameter
is doomed to be as problematic - at least - as found in p–Pb collisions at the LHC.

Lighter ions also offer large luminosities that are important for several aspects:

– Data on beauty mesons and bottomonium in p–A collisions can be used to constrain nPDFs [325]
better than their charm counterparts, because of the larger scale given by the mass and by the
opportunity that they are less affected by collective effects. But they demand large statistics that
can be achieved with lighter ions.

– Larger luminosities will beneﬁt measurements in p–A collisions for observables with large scales,

like high-mass DY or dijets, for precise determination of nPDFs.

– UPCs and photon-photon studies [583] in A–A collisions will greatly beneﬁt in spite of the Z2(4)
factor for the photon luminosities that can be overcompensated by the larger nucleon-nucleon
luminosity.

– Larger luminosities can also beneﬁt small-x forward observables that, like dijets [407], aim to

reach quite large transverse momenta in p–A collisions.

Lighter ions offer a bridge between small systems and Pb–Pb without requiring centrality se-
lection that is problematic both in pp, p–A and peripheral A–A. In the framework of saturation mod-
els [783] that aim to describe collective effects in small systems without requiring ﬁnal state interactions
(see e.g. [950] and references therein), the extension from the proton to the nuclear case in some of
the phenomenological realisations is done by a simple rescaling of the squared saturation momentum
Q2
A1/3. And the centrality dependence is assumed to be proportional to the nuclear proﬁle, which
leads to strong problems in the nuclear periphery where a dilute situation is restored. Lighter ions offer
a check of our ideas on the nuclear size versus energy leading the density that determines saturation, and
the use of minimum bias observables instead of centrality-sliced ones that would greatly simplify the
phenomenology.

s ∝

To conclude, lighter ions offer several advantages and disadvantages for initial stage studies. The
main disadvantage is the fact that theory calculations usually assume the limit of scattering of a dilute
projectile (proton) on a dense target (nucleus). Lighter ion-ion collisions are further from this limit. On
the other hand, they offer: (i) a bridge between small and large systems without resorting to centrality
selection that would be useful for constraining the nuclear wave function, the collision dynamics and
the interpretation of collectivity; (ii) the possibility of larger luminosities for UPCs and forward observ-
ables for nPDFs determination and small-x studies; and (iii) a more affordable setup for microscopic
calculations of nuclear corrections.

The collision of ion species with A

APb is an appealing opportunity to expand the physics
programme presented in this document. The recent Xe–Xe run of only eight hours has provided valuable
input for the physics performance of ion collisions lighter than Pb at the LHC. Broadly, the advantages
of using A
APb collisions are twofold: smaller collision systems sample key physical parameters
beyond what can be probed with Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions, and they allow higher luminosity running
to maximize the accumulation of rare events in heavy-ion collisions. This higher luminosity would
enable high-precision measurements for currently rare observables in Pb–Pb collisions as well as the
study of observables totally inaccessible in Pb–Pb collisions.

(cid:28)

A scenario is envisioned in which the programme is extended in two directions: a) a short run
of O–O (A = 16) to study system-size dependence and b) longer running of a species of intermediate
A to achieve a large luminosity increase. The choice of the intermediate species will be dictated by
the competition of increased luminosity with lower A against the goal of studying the properties of an
extended QGP system. Optimizing the choice of species will require further study from the accelerator,
experimental, and theoretical communities; in this document Ar–Ar (A = 40) collisions are considered
as a test-case for the choice of intermediate ion. It is understood that any choice of collision species will
likely require a pilot run prior to beginning dedicated collisions.

Section 2.4 describes the technical capabilities of the LHC to provide lighter-ion collisions, as
well as the expected performance for several ion species. For example, for Ar–Ar the expectation for

we consider the nucleon–nucleon integrated luminosity per month of running, which could be larger by
a factor 8–25 (for p = 1.5–1.9) with respect to Pb–Pb collisions, i.e. one month of Ar–Ar collisions
1 of Pb–Pb collisions. This gain would be the same in all centrality
would be equivalent to
classes (deﬁned in terms of percentiles of the hadronic cross section). Jet quenching estimates for light
ion (Ar–Ar) collisions are presented in Sect. 6.5. Section 4.3.2 discusses ﬂow measurements with light
ions. A discussion of the role that light ion collisions can play for small-x and nPDF studies is reported
in Sect. 10.5. Finally, the implications of Ar–Ar collisions for the study of light-by-light scattering are
discussed in Sect. 11.2.

Even a short O–O run can help clarify the uncertainty concerning the onset of QGP or QGP-like
phenomena in high-multiplicity pA and pp collisions, as discussed in section 9.10. The search for signals
associated with the QGP in O–O collisions should complement the searches in pp and p–Pb collisions.In
particular, the O–O system has well-understood collision geometry as described in detail in Sect. 9.10,
enabling the study of collisions with low values of

the LHC naturally dovetails with p–O collisions whose signiﬁcance for cosmic-ray physics is detailed in

Complementing Pb–Pb collisions, the possibility of high-luminosity extended LHC runs with

by more than one order of magnitude, make Ar–Ar collisions an extremely attractive option for hard-
probe measurements that in Pb–Pb collisions are limited or impossible, such as boosted top-quark decay

Heavy-ion beams are composed of nuclei which carry electric charge Ze (e is the electron charge
and Z is the atomic number). They are accelerated to nearly the speed of light, thus they generate large
electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds. The EM ﬁelds generated by the relativistic ion can interact with the other
nucleus or its EM ﬁelds. Therefore, besides nuclear hadronic interactions, EM interactions also occur in
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These EM interactions can be studied in so-called ultra-peripheral
collisions (UPC) which occur when the distance between two nuclei in the transverse plane is larger than
two times the nuclear radius, and hadronic interactions are thus suppressed [578].

A broad range of processes can be studied with γγ interactions in UPC. In the following, a few
examples of photon-induced processes are considered at the HL-LHC: exclusive production of µ+µ−
or p¯p pairs, a rare process of light-by-light (LbyL) scattering and a potential of searches for axion-like
particles (ALP).

particles in the spotlight of searches for new physics, with scalar and pseudo-scalar particles (elementary

11.3 Proton-oxygen collisions for cosmic ray research

Coordinators: Hans Dembinski (MPI for Nuclear Physics, Heidelberg)

The recent coincident observations of gamma rays and neutrinos from the ﬂaring blazar TXS
0506+056 conﬁrmed that active galactic nuclei produce high-energy cosmic rays [988]. This long
awaited ﬁnding demonstrates that sources of cosmic rays are linked to the most violent places in our
universe. Measurements of cosmic rays contribute to the understanding of the high-energy universe.
Since cosmic rays are charged and bent by magnetic ﬁelds in space onto chaotic paths, their arrival di-
rections at Earth are highly isotropic, but their mass composition carries an imprint of the source physics.
Precision measurements of minimum-bias events in proton-oxygen collisions have the unique power to
resolve current ambiguities in the mass composition measured with atmospheric air-shower techniques.

of cosmic rays. Above particle energies of 1015 eV,

Cosmic rays are nuclei from protons to iron (heavier elements are negligible). The energy-
dependent mass composition of cosmic rays is characteristic for different source scenarios, as shown
in Fig. 104, left-hand-side, which displays predictions (lines and markers) of the mean-logarithmic-mass

extensive air showers, huge secondary particle cascades produced by collisions between cosmic rays and
nuclei in the atmosphere. The two leading observables to infer
are the depth Xmax of the shower
maximum in the atmosphere (yellow band in Fig. 104), and the number Nµ of muons produced in the
shower (green band in Fig. 104). The width of those bands has two main contributions: the experimental
uncertainties, and the hadronic model uncertainties inherent in converting the air shower observables into

purpose heavy-ion event generator EPOS-LHC [989], or specialized hadronic interaction models such as
QGSJet-II.04 [990] and SIBYLL-2.3c [991]. All are designed to describe nucleus-nucleus and soft-QCD
interactions by extrapolating combinations of Regge ﬁeld theory tuned to available data and perturbative
QCD. Uncertainties in these models arise from a lack of data on multiparticle production in the very
forward phase-space in hadron-nucleus interactions at the TeV scale.

LHC measurements have already reduced the spread of model predictions for Xmax in the latest
generation of models. This big improvement was due to high-precision measurements of the inelastic
cross-section (see e.g. [992] and references therein). Further measurements now have the potential to
make the spread negligible. The model spread for Nµ is still large and predictions are not consistent
with Xmax for cosmic rays with the same mass. There is overwhelming evidence from air shower ex-
periments [987, 993–996] that the muon number Nµ is underestimated in simulations starting at about
1016 eV. This corresponds to a cms energy of 4.3 TeV, well accessible by the LHC. Shown in Fig. 104,
right-hand-side, is a representative data point from the Pierre Auger Observatory, which is well above
EPOS-LHC predictions – and EPOS-LHC and SIBYLL-2.3c are already models which produce the
highest muon number of all hadronic interaction models models. This is called the Muon Puzzle.

Two aspects of multi-particle production with a strong effect on Nµ have been identiﬁed [997], the
hadron multiplicity Nmult and the energy fraction α that goes into neutral pions. The impact of changing
these variables in EPOS-LHC at 13 TeV cms energy and extrapolating upward in energy is also shown
in Fig.104, right-hand-side. A combined measurement to 5 % accuracy of both variables at the LHC
well below the experimental
would reduce the model uncertainty for the conversion of Xmax to
uncertainty of 10 %, and has the clear potential to resolve the discrepancy in the muon number Nµ. To
reach the accuracy goal, the following minimum-bias measurements are desired:

Energy ﬂow measurements separated by hadronic and electromagnetic energy deposit constrain both
Nmult and α, and can be done further forward than direct measurements of charged tracks. The particle
identiﬁcation provided by the ALICE and LHCb experiments provides important additional information,
needed to tune and test internal parameters of hadronic interaction models. In particular, the number of
produced baryons was found to strongly affect the number of muons in air showers at ground, despite
their small number compared to pions [998].

To meet the accuracy goal, Nmult and α need to be measured in proton-oxygen collisions at the
LHC, which directly mimic interactions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. Constraining α and Nmult

hadrons experience strong nuclear modiﬁcation [323,755,1001]. A sufﬁciently accurate theory to predict
nuclear modiﬁcation in the p–O system based on pp and p–Pb data is not yet available, and a simple
interpolation is not reliable since both systems are far away in ln A. The difﬁculty of predicting hadron
production in ion collisions is demonstrated in Fig. 105. EPOS-LHC predictions for Xe–Xe collisions
signiﬁcantly underestimate the observed yields in the central region, despite a satisfactory description
of pp, p–Pb, and Pb–Pb collisions. The deviations in Xe–Xe are much larger than what is expected
from a simple interpolation [999]. The dominant nuclear effects are expected to be different for light
and heavy collision partners. Light nuclei are described by the shell model and nucleon correlations are
important. Lead nuclei can be described by a simpler model, essentially a Wood-Saxon potential with
reduced nucleon correlations that cannot be probed well in experiments.

Selecting peripheral p–Pb collisions to mimic p-air collisions with the same number of binary
collisions was considered as an alternative to direct p–O measurements, but this option also increases
the uncertainty too much. Centrality in p–Pb collisions is extracted from the data using various centrality
estimators with different selection biases. These biases would increase the uncertainty of the proposed
measurements well beyond the target of 5 % [773]. However, p–O measurements could provide a sensi-
tive test of centrality estimators since the thickness of the oxygen nucleus and hence the average number
of wounded nucleons is about a factor of two smaller. The advantages of estimating centrality in a small
ion system are discussed in Sect. 9.10.

In conclusion, collisions of p–O at the LHC are highly desirable to solve the outlined questions.
The corresponding measurements would be a crucial input to cosmic ray physics and have the potential
to result in signiﬁcant advances in the century-long ridde of the origin of cosmic rays. The luminosity
requirements to reach the physics goals are moderate. A statistical accuracy better than 5 % can be
achieved with 100 M minimum-bias events. Luminosity calculations for light ion systems are given in
Sect. 2.4. The setup of p–O collisions would follow the successful rapid set-up procedure previously
used in the 2012 p–Pb run and the 2017 Xe–Xe run, as described in Sect. 12.

It is worthwhile noting that a period of oxygen acceleration in the SPS would also provide the
opportunity to complement cosmic-ray related measurements of nuclear fragmentation at NA61/SHINE
[1002, 1003] at beam momenta of 150 A GeV/c. These measurements aim at improving our under-
standing of the cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy and to evaluate the cosmic-ray background for
signatures of astrophysical dark matter [1004]. Another opportunity is the study of very forward produc-
tion of hadrons in the p–O system at √sNN ∼
100 GeV at the LHCb experiment, by colliding the oxygen
beam with proton gas provided by an upgraded SMOG system, as described in Sect. 11.4.

Fixed target experiments present many advantages having the versatility of polarised and nuclear
targets and allowing one to reach high luminosities with dense and long targets. The 7 TeV proton and
2.76 A.TeV lead beams allow one to reach a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of √sNN = 115
GeV and √sNN = 72 GeV with a centre-of-mass rapidity boost of 4.8 and 4.2 units, respectively.
These energies correspond to an energy domain between the SPS and nominal RHIC energies. The large

The physics opportunities offered by a ﬁxed-target programme at the LHC have been developed
in several publications of the AFTER@LHC study group [499, 503, 1005] and can be summarised as
follows:

– advance our understanding of the large-x gluon, sea quark and heavy-quark content in the nucleon

and nucleus,

– advance our understanding of the dynamics and spin of gluons inside polarised nucleons (if a

polarised target were used),

– advance our understanding of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formed in heavy-ion col-

lisions between SPS and RHIC energies.

11.4.1 Status and future plans in LHCb

The LHCb experiment has pioneered ﬁxed target physics at the LHC since Run 2, using noble-gas targets
(helium, neon and argon) obtained by injecting the gas directly in the LHC vacuum pipe in the proximity
of the LHCb collision point through the SMOG device [1006]. The nominal target gas pressure of

The forward geometry of the detector is particularly well suited for this conﬁguration. It provides

beam energy of 6.5 TeV), fully equipped with tracking and particle identiﬁcation. Proton-nucleus and
Pb-nucleus collisions using ﬁxed targets of different nuclear size can be studied at the energy scale of
√sNN ∼

100 GeV with unique coverage of the high-x regime in the target nucleon.

The samples collected during Run 2, corresponding to integrated luminosities up to about 100 nb−
allowed to perform studies of particle production which are of particular relevance to cosmic ray physics [1007],
and to collect unprecedented samples of charmed hadrons in ﬁxed-target collisions at this energy scale [502].
These data can provide unique inputs to discriminate cold nuclear matter effects in heavy-ﬂavour pro-
duction from the effect of deconﬁnement, and to study nuclear PDFs at large x. The physics reach of
heavy-ﬂavour studies is presently limited by the size of these samples. Measurements of absolute cross-
sections are also limited in accuracy by the determination of the luminosity, since the gas pressure can

An upgraded gas target device, named SMOG2, is currently being developed, and expected to be
operational already during Run 3. In the new setup, the gas is contained in a storage cell, consisting of
a 20-cm-long open-ended tube with a diameter of 1 cm, fed by a capillary. It allows to increase the gas
density in the target by at least one order of magnitude with respect to SMOG, reaching luminosities of

acquire ﬁxed target events simultaneously with collision events with negligible impact to the pp physics
program. The new setup would also allow other gases to be injected, notably hydrogen and deuterium,
providing pp collisions in ﬁxed-target mode as a reference for all pA collision samples, and extending
the physics case to the study of the three-dimensional structure functions of the nucleon through spin-
independent observables [1008]. Heavy noble gases as Kr and Xe would also be usable. The device will

events in an assumed sample of p–Ar collisions corresponding to 0.1 fb−
in the understanding of parton distributions for gluons, antiquark and heavy-quarks at large x, where
PDFs are now poorly constrained, are foreseeable [503, 1005]. The precise determination of heavy
hadron production at large x is expected to clarify the extent of the intrinsic heavy quark content in
the nucleon [932, 1009], and to constrain modiﬁcations of the nuclear PDFs due to initial state effects
(anti-shadowing and EMC effect [1010], saturation effects [1011]). Sequential quarkonia suppression is
a main signature for deconﬁnement [423], but is also affected by ﬁnal state effects as break-up of the
heavy quark pair [1012] and statistical recombination [424]. The rich samples of different quarkonia
states reconstructed in ﬁxed target data will allow to investigate sequential suppression at an energy scale
between the SPS and RHIC/LHC, for collision systems ranging from pp to Pb–Xe. The study of colli-
sions of Pb beams on heavy nuclei has been limited in Run 2 by the detector tracking capabilities and
would greatly proﬁt from the higher detector granularity offered by the LHCb upgrade 1 and upgrade 2
detectors.

The ﬁxed-target program also presents a very good testbed for the hydrodynamic description of
the QCD medium produced in heavy-ion collisions down to the energy of √sNN ∼
100 GeV, thanks
to the considerable pseudorapidity coverage, with particle identiﬁcation capability for pions, kaons and

experimental ﬁndings in proton(deuteron)-nucleus and pp collisions at the LHC [311–314, 718] and at
RHIC [1018] can be probed in a novel kinematic regime.

The study of ultra-peripheral collisions in the ﬁxed target conﬁguration also offers a complemen-
tary kinematic regime to the similar studies in beam-beam collisions discussed in Section 10. An in-
triguing possibility would be the observation of ηc photoproduction in the PbAr sample, where the cross
section is estimated to be of order 1 nb [1019] provided that the signal can be cleanly separated from the
background due to radiative J/ψ decays. This would constitute a conﬁrmation for the existence of the
odderon, since the ηc state cannot be produced in the γ-pomeron process and would be under threshold
for the γ-γ process in ﬁxed-target PbA collisions. Large samples of exclusively produced ρ0 and ω are
also expected [1020].

Studies of proton collisions on light nuclei provide crucial inputs to the understanding of cosmic
ray propagation in the interstellar medium (using H and He targets) and in the atmosphere (using N
and O targets). The interpretation of the precise measurements of the antiproton component in cosmic
rays, performed in the last decade by the PAMELA [1021] and AMS-02 [1022] space-based missions,
is presently limited by the knowledge of the antiproton production in the interstellar medium. The
ﬁrst measurement of antiproton production in pHe collisions has been performed by LHCb with Run
2 data [1007] and has been used to improve the sensitivity to a possible dark matter contribution to the
cosmic antiproton ﬂux [1023, 1024]. During Run 3, it is planned to extend these studies with a hydrogen
target. The production of antineutrons can also be inferred indirectly by evaluating isospin violation in
antiproton production from proton-hydrogen and proton-deuterium collisions.

A better understanding of the bulk of particle production in high-energy hadronic collisions is
also crucial to the modeling of atmospheric showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Despite
the moderate energy scale, ﬁxed target data offer the unique possibility to use a wide range of nuclear
targets, including nitrogen and oxygen, and to study production at large x. The main background for
the observation of the astrophysical high-energy neutrino ﬂux, recently established by the IceCube col-
laboration [1025], originates from neutrinos of PeV energy produced from decays of charmed hadrons
in atmospheric showers. A relevant uncertainty on this background is related to the possible intrisic
charm contribution to the charm PDF at large x [1026]. Knowledge of light hadron production, notably
baryons, at large x will allow to improve the modeling of the number of muons produced in the lateral de-
velopment of the showers, which is a key observable to infer the mass composition of ultra-high-energy
cosmic rays, as discussed in Sect. 11.3.

More ambitious projects for future target upgrades have also been proposed for a possible installa-
tion in LHCb on the time scale of HL-LHC. These are beyond the baseline LHCb Upgrade 2. A polarised
gas target similar to that used in HERMES [1027], installed upstream of the LHCb vertex detector, would
make LHCb a key contributor to spin physics. With this option, LHCb would have access to single spin
asymmetries in an unique kinematic range for a variety of ﬁnal states, including unique measurements
with quarkonium and Drell-Yan lepton pairs [1028]. Measurements of the three-dimensional structure
of nucleons from hadron collisions would be highly complementary to the program at the electron-ion
collider, which is proposed on a comparable time scale.

11.4.2 Opportunities with ALICE

The ALICE detector provides many physics opportunities if running in the ﬁxed-target mode with the
LHC proton and lead beams. One of the main strengths of ALICE in the ﬁxed-target mode would be
its large rapidity coverage. Assuming a target location at z = 0, the ALICE muon spectrometer would

170

access the mid- to backward rapidity in the centre-of-mass frame (
0.8) considering an
incident proton beam on the target. For an incident lead beam, the muon spectrometer rapidity coverage
is
0.3. In addition, the absorber in front of the muon tracking stations is an asset for
background rejection and Drell-Yan studies. The ALICE central barrel offers a complementary coverage
to the muon arm by accessing the very backward rapidity region (
3.9 with the proton
−
beam and
3.4 with the lead beam), reaching the end of the phase space for several
probes. Thanks to its excellent particle identiﬁcation capabilities, particle detection and identiﬁcation
down to low pT, unique measurements of soft probes and open heavy ﬂavours can be pursued. Another
asset of the ALICE apparatus is the capability to operate with good performance in a high particle den-
sity environment. Access to the most central AA collisions at √sNN = 72 GeV should be possible if
the detector occupancy does not exceed the one expected in Pb–Pb collisions at 50 kHz. In addition,
the ALICE Collaboration could potentially devote a signiﬁcant data taking time to a ﬁxed-target pro-
gramme (especially with the proton beam), allowing the collection of large integrated luminosities and
the investigation of several target species.

Two main solutions are being investigated to deliver ﬁxed-target collisions to ALICE: an internal
gaseous target or an internal solid target (coupled to a bent crystal to deﬂect the beam halo). On the
1
one hand, a gas-jet or a storage cell with levelled gas pressure would allow to deliver about 45 pb−
1 in case of unpolarised H2 collisions), and
of proton-polarised hydrogen collisions to ALICE (260 pb−
1 of Pb–Xe collisions per year. For the luminosity calculation, a time duration of 107 s and 106 s,
8 nb−
corresponding to one LHC year, is considered for the proton and lead beams, respectively. With a gas
system the target can be polarised, but requires large space to be installed, most likely outside the ALICE
barrel magnet, 7 metres from the nominal Interaction Point (IP). In that case, additional detectors for
vertexing are needed as well as studies of the tracking performances of the TPC in such conditions. A
simple unpolarised storage cell might potentially be used closer to the current ALICE IP. On the other
hand, the usage of an internal solid target coupled to a bent crystal has the advantage of more portability,
allowing one to install the target closer to the IP, from 2.75 to 4.7 m to the IP, and thus beneﬁting of better

performances from the current ALICE apparatus. With such a device 37 pb−

collisions, and 5 nb−
of these solutions could be installed during LS3.

1 (6 pb−

The performance for several key probes has been investigated using fast simulations [503] and it

is summarised in the following.

– Quarkonia: Very large yields are expected for charmonia (up to

106 J/ψ) in the ALICE muon
spectrometer both in pp and Pb-A collisions7 considering one LHC year of data taking. The Υ(1S)
will also be within reach. Looking at quarkonium suppression as a function of rapidity and the
system size would allow one to search for the onset of the QGP formation, and to determine the
in-medium modiﬁcation of the QCD forces for centre-of-mass energies between the ones probed
at RHIC and the SPS. In pA collisions, Υ(1S) could be used to probe large-x gluons in the target
(0.1 < x < 1), in order to constrain the anti-shadowing and EMC effects.

∼

– Drell-Yan: A precise measurement of the Drell-Yan process with the muon spectrometer can probe
initial state effects on quarks of momentum fraction 0.05 < x < 0.8 at a mass scale of Mµµ >
4 GeV/c2 from pA to A- collisions. The correlated background from bb and cc pairs in the dimuon
decay channel is largely reduced at the lower centre-of-mass energy of the ﬁxed-target mode, with
respect to the TeV energy range.
– Open heavy ﬂavour: At ylab ∼

1 about 3000 (up to 100) D0 are expected to be produced per 0.1
rapidity unit per year in pp (Pb-A) collisions, respectively. The ALICE central barrel probes the
end of the D meson phase-space, in particular if the vertex is located at z < 4 m from the IP. This

171

would allow one to reach very large-x gluon close to 1 at low mass scale, where the contribution of
the intrinsic charm component in the proton could largely increase the D meson yield. Hence the
ALICE central barrel is well suited to study the large-x intrinsic charm component in the proton.
– Identiﬁed charged hadrons: In few hours of Pb–A data taking, it would be already possible to
collect up to 106 minimum bias events with the ALICE central barrel which would allow one
to reach an absolute statistical uncertainty of 0.01 on the elliptic ﬂow coefﬁcient v2 for pions
and protons, 0.02 for kaons, and 0.05 for antiprotons in semi-central events. Measurements of
identiﬁed particles up to very large rapidities would complement the limiting fragmentation studies
carried out by the BRAHMS and PHOBOS experiments at RHIC. In addition, particle yields
and ﬂow coefﬁcients measured at large rapidities are powerful tools to constrain the temperature
dependence of the medium shear viscosity [1029]. Thermal model calculations also indicate that
the temperature and baryonic chemical potential depend on the rapidity [1030–1032] suggesting
that one can perform a rapidity scan of the QGP phase diagram in a complementary approach to
the Beam Energy Scan programme of RHIC.

– Antiproton production: Measurements of antiproton production cross sections in p–H, p–He, p–C,
p–N and p–O collisions are important inputs for theoretical calculations of the secondary cosmic
antiproton spectrum [1033–1035], where secondary antiprotons originate from the high energy
scattering between the interstellar matter and the primary cosmic rays. The measurement of a cos-
mic antiproton excess with respect to expectations from secondary antiproton production would
open new perspectives on the indirect detection of dark matter or unknown astrophysical mecha-
nisms of cosmic ray acceleration. Complementarily to LHCb [1007], the ALICE central barrel can
measure very slow antiprotons down to few hundred MeV momentum. Measuring slow antipro-
tons produced with the LHC proton beam on a nuclear target is equivalent to the case where the
nuclear target travels at TeV energies, hit an interstellar proton at rest and produces an antiproton
with high energy. Thanks to the large antiproton yields expected in p–H2 collisions (larger than
108 per 0.1 rapidity unit per year), the ALICE central barrel is well placed to help constraining the
uncertainty on the cosmic antiproton spectrum.

– Strangeness: Thanks to the large yields (

1) of
Λ hyperons expected to be produced in the ALICE central barrel by using a longitudinally po-
larised target with the proton beam, a precise measurement of the longitudinal spin transfer DLL
of the Λ hyperon could be carried out. So far only limited experimental results exist with poor
precision [1036, 1037]. Measurements with ALICE would give a unique opportunity to study the
spin-dependent strange quark (antiquark) densities at 0.35 < x < 0.7.

108 per 0.1 rapidity unit per year at ylab ∼

∼

– Charmonium and pentaquark photoproduction: Exclusive J/ψ photoproduction is known to be
sensitive to gluon Generalised Parton Distributions (GPD) at leading order [1038]. ALICE in
ﬁxed target mode would have a unique opportunity to study the yet unknown GPD Eg thanks to the
measurement of single transverse spin asymmetries of photoproduced J/ψ by using a transversally
polarised H target with the proton beam [1039, 1040]. About 200 photoproduced J/ψ per year are
expected to be produced in the muon spectrometer acceptance. Moreover, the photoproduction of
hidden charm pentaquark states [1041] might be possible in the central barrel acceptance which
allows for the access to low photon-proton centre-of-mass energies (Wγp ∼
5 GeV). About 2 to 20
pentaquarks are expected to be produced in the ALICE central barrel per year in p–H2 collisions.

Note that these studies were performed assuming a vertex position at the ALICE IP for the quarko-
nia, identiﬁed hadron production, as well as for charmonium and pentaquark photoproduction, and a
vertex position at 4.7 m from the IP for the antiproton and strangeness production.

Studies are ongoing to address the technical feasibility of the target system integration in the
experiment, as well as simulation studies to evaluate the ALICE apparatus tracking performance for
target positions displaced by a few metres from the IP. Moreover, investigations are ongoing to extend the
ALICE rapidity coverage for several observables thanks to combined measurements of muons detected

both in the ALICE central and the muon spectrometer (see as an example the work in [1042] in collider
mode).

12 Summary of luminosity requirements and proposed run schedule

The physics programme presented in this report requires data-taking campaigns with various colliding
systems with centre-of-mass energies and integrated luminosities Lint as outlined in the following. In
some cases the requirements are updated or new with respect to the present baseline LHC programme (see
Sec. 2.2 and Ref. [2]). The main variations are: a much larger Lint target for p–Pb collisions, motivated
by high-precision studies of both initial and ﬁnal-state effects, following the surprising discoveries of
collective-like effects in small collision systems; a large sample of pp collisions at top LHC energy to
reach the highest possible multiplicities with the smallest hadronic colliding system; moderate-statistics
samples of O–O (as mentioned in , this would be a limited “pilot-run” scenarion that could not achieve
the values listed in Tables 4 and 5) and p–O collisions, to study the onset of hot-medium effects and to
tune cosmic-ray particle production models, respectively. Finally, as discussed in Sec. 11.1, extended
LHC running with colliding intermediate-mass nuclei (as, for example, Ar–Ar or Kr–Kr), offers the
unique opportunity of a large increase in nucleon–nucleon luminosity to access novel probes of the QGP
and to open a precision era for probes which are still rare with the Pb–Pb system. The working group
considers the high-luminosity Pb–Pb and p–Pb programmes to be the priorities that should be pursued
in Run 3 and Run 4. High-luminosity runs with intermediate-mass nuclei are regarded as an appealing
case for extending the heavy-ion programme at the LHC after LS4. This case, including the choice of
the optimal nuclear species, should be studied further from the theoretical and operational points of view,
both of which could be informed with one or two pilot runs with different species.

13.1

Introduction

(cid:112)

In this section the physics opportunities associated with the operation of the HE-LHC with heavy-ion
beams are discussed. These ﬁrst considerations are based on studies carried out in the scope of the
Future Circular Collider (FCC) Study group [407, 1043]. For a centre-of-mass energy √s = 27 TeV for
pp collisions, the relation √sNN = √s
Z1Z2/A1A2 gives the energy per nucleon–nucleon collision of
√sNN = 10.6 TeV for Pb–Pb (Z = 82, A = 208) and 17 TeV for p–Pb collisions. The present estimate
of the integrated luminosity per month of running is larger by a factor two with respect to the current
1 per experiment, see Section 2.2. The possibility
projection for the future LHC runs, i.e. Lint ≈
6 nb−
of using nuclei smaller than Pb, like e.g. 40Ar or 129Xe, to achieve larger instantaneous luminosity is also
under consideration. For example, the integrated nucleon–nucleon (NN) luminosity per run for Xe–Xe
collisions at √sNN = 11.5 TeV could be 2–3 times larger than for Pb–Pb collisions (see integrated LNN
values in Tables 4 and 5).

The increase in the centre-of-mass energy and integrated luminosity at the FCC with respect to
the LHC opens up novel opportunities for physics studies of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) described
in a recent CERN Yellow Report [407]. Most of these opportunities also apply to the HE-LHC scenario,
although with more moderate reach in terms of available probes and kinematics coverage. The main
scientiﬁc motivations for a heavy-ion programme at the HE-LHC can be summarized as follows.

Novel access to QCD thermodynamics and QCD equilibration processes. Substantially increasing
the centre-of-mass energy leads to the creation of initially denser and hotter strongly-interacting sys-
tems that expand for a longer duration and over a larger volume, thereby developing stronger collec-
tive phenomena. Extrapolations of LHC measurements indicate that the initial energy density increases
by a factor about 1.4 from √sNN = 5.5 TeV to 10.6 TeV, up to values of about 22–24 GeV/fm3 (at
τ = 1 fm/c). These estimates are presented in Section 13.2. The QGP formed at the HE-LHC collision
energies reaches closer to a range of temperatures (T
1 GeV) where charm quarks start to contribute
as active thermal degrees of freedom in the QGP equation of state, thus playing a novel role in QCD
equilibration processes.

∼

Characterisation of dense QCD matter through hard-scattering processes. As detailed in Sec-
tion 13.3, the HE-LHC would provide a much larger abundance of hard-scattering processes than the
LHC, as well as novel probes like the top quark and, potentially, the Higgs boson [943, 945, 1044]. A
notable example is provided by high-momentum (thus, highly boosted) t
qq decay chains,
which are promising probes of the QGP time evolution and of the role of colour coherence [945]. The
secondary production of charm quarks in scatterings between quark and gluon constituents of the hot
QCD medium could reach a substantial fraction of the initial production in partonic hard scatterings and
be observed for the ﬁrst time.

Exploration of saturated parton densities in a previously-uncharted, ultra-dense kinematic do-
main. As discussed in Section 13.4, the higher centre-of-mass energy of the HE-LHC allows one to
explore a wide previously-uncharted kinematic range at low x and Q2, where parton saturation is ex-
6 in the Pb
pected to set in. Proton–nucleus collisions would have a coverage down to x

2.76 TeV and extrapolated to 5.5, 10.6 and 39 TeV. The values for Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC and
FCC are from Ref. [407]. The values for Pb–Pb collisions at the HE-LHC are estimated using the same
parametrisations as used for the FCC. The values for Xe–Xe collisions at the HE-LHC are all estimated
on the basis of the multiplicity extrapolation from the measurement by the ALICE Collaboration [1046]
(it is assumed that the transverse energy density scales only with the multiplicity, neglecting possible
differences of the average energy per particle between Pb–Pb and Xe–Xe and between the LHC and the
HE-LHC).

13.2 Global characteristics of nucleus–nucleus collisions at the HE-LHC

Extrapolating measurements of charged particle multiplicity, transverse energy and femtoscopic corre-
lations at lower energies, one can obtain estimates for the growth of global event characteristics from
the LHC to the HE-HC and the FCC. In particular, up to the top LHC energy, the growth of charged-
particle multiplicity per participant pair per unit rapidity in nucleus–nucleus collisions is consistent with
(√sNN)0.3 (see e.g. [1045]). As shown in Table 17, for
a slowly-rising power-law: dNch/dη (η = 0)
Pb–Pb this amounts to an increase of a factor
1.2 from the LHC to the HE-LHC. The multiplicity in
central Xe–Xe collisions is expected to be lower by 35% with respect to Pb–Pb collisions at the HE-LHC,
and similar to that of Pb–Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV.

∝
∼

In general, the global event characteristics listed in Table 17 determine the spatio-temporal extent
QGP system, and they constrain the thermodynamic conditions that apply after thermalization. The
measured transverse energy per unit rapidity dET/dη (see Table 17) is of particular importance since
it constrains the initial energy density. The energy density is expected to increase by a factor 1.4 from
the LHC to the HE-LHC, reaching a value of 22–24 GeV/fm3 at the time of 1 fm/c [407]. Using the
600–800 MeV is expected at
arguments presented in Ref. [407], an initial temperature as large as T0 ≈
the time
(0.05 fm/c) after which both nuclei traverse each other at HE-LHC energies. In the case of
Xe–Xe collisions the energy density is estimated to be signiﬁcantly lower than that for Pb–Pb and similar
to that of Pb–Pb at LHC energies.

13.3 QGP studies with hard probes

13.3.1 Hard processes in nucleus–nucleus collisions at the HE-LHC

The increase in energy and luminosity (in the case of Xe–Xe) from the LHC to the HE-LHC provides
new tools to study the matter created in the collisions of heavy ions. In Fig. 106 (left), cross sections
for different processes and different energies are computed with MCFM [1047] at the highest available
4 for jets with
order. The increases amount to a factor
pT > 100 GeV/c and for Higgs, and

2 for charm, beauty, W and Z production,

∼
6 for top-pair production.

∼

The motivations for measurements of top quarks in heavy-ion collisions are multifold. In p–Pb
collisions the cross sections efﬁciently probe the nuclear gluon PDFs in a wide range in momentum
mt [943] (see Section 10.4.4). In Pb–Pb collisions, the top-quark observ-
fraction x at high scale Q
ables are sensitive to the energy-loss of heavy quarks [1048] and by selecting boosted (very high pT)
top quarks one could also probe the QGP medium at later times as the decays of boosted top quarks get

Lorentz time dilated (see next section). For example, the estimated measurable yields for t¯t
(using the per-month luminosities discussed in Section 13.1) with realistic analysis cuts and conservative
50% efﬁciency for b-jet tagging are about 104 in Pb–Pb collisions and 3
104 in Xe–Xe collisions (for
the case of three-fold increase of NN integrated luminosity with respect to Pb–Pb).

Another potential novel probe of the QGP medium at HE-LHC and FCC energies is the Higgs
boson. The Higgs boson has a lifetime of τ
50 fm/c, which is much larger than the time extent of the
QGP phase [1049, 1050]. In Ref. [1049] it has been argued that the Higgs boson interacts strongly with
the quarks and gluons of the QGP and the interactions induce its decay in the gluon–gluon or quark–
antiquark channels, thus depleting the branching ratio to the most common “observation” channels γγ
or ZZ(cid:63). More recent detailed theoretical calculations, including virtual corrections, predict however no
visible suppression of the scalar boson [1051]. The cross section for Higgs boson production in Pb–Pb
collisions is expected to increase by a factor about 4 when going from √sNN = 5.5 TeV to √sNN =
10.6 TeV [1044]. A statistically-signiﬁcant Higgs boson observation in the γγ decay channel in Pb–Pb
1 (estimated as in Ref. [1044]),
collisions at the HE-LHC requires an integrated luminosity of 70 nb−
which corresponds to about 12 months with the present machine performance projections. The analysis
used similar photon selections as used by ATLAS and CMS in pp collisions: pT > 30, 40 GeV/c,
< 4,
Risol = 0.3. The backgrounds included the irreducible QCD diphoton continuum plus 30% of events
coming from misidentiﬁed γ-jet and jet-jet processes. The corresponding invariant mass distribution is
shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 106. With Xe–Xe collisions the same statistical signiﬁcance could
be reached in 4 months.

13.3.2 Boosted tops and the time evolution of QGP opacity

The HE-LHC would provide large rates of highly-boosted heavy particles, such as tops, Z and W bosons.
It is expected that when these particles decay the density proﬁle of the QGP has already evolved. It has
been argued that the hadronically-decaying W bosons in events with a t¯t pair can provide unique insights
into the time structure of the QGP [945]. This is because the time decays of the top and the W bosons are
followed by a time-delay in the interaction of the decay products of the W boson with the surrounding
medium due to a colour coherence effect. The sum of these three times, several fm/c for boosted tops,

would be the time at which the interaction with the QGP begins, providing a unique way to directly
measure the time structure of the QGP evolution. In addition, due to colour coherence effects, energy
loss would be initially absent for the colour-singlet qq decay products of a highly-boosted W boson:
the two quarks would start to be quenched only when their distance becomes larger than the colour
correlation length of the medium, which depends on the transport coefﬁcient ˆq (the average transverse
momentum squared that particles exchange with the medium per unit mean-free path) [1052]. The effect
on the reconstructed masses of the top and W was studied with different energy loss scenarios as a
proof of concept of the potential of these observables to access completely novel quantities in heavy-ion
collisions [945].

For this study, the pT reach of top quarks in Pb–Pb collisions is of special importance, because
it determines the maximum time delay for probing the QGP. The upper panel of Fig. 107 shows the
estimated pT distribution of the reconstructed top yields in Pb–Pb collisions at the HE-LHC with an

13.3.3 Heavy ﬂavour and quarkonia

Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are among the hard probes that have provided important insights on
the formation and the characterics of the QGP, see Sections 5 and 7, and Ref. [258]. In this section,
a few selected aspects that could represent novel or particularly remarkable observations at HE-LHC
energy are discussed, namely: i) large production of thermal charm from interactions of light quarks and
gluons within the QGP; ii) observation of an enhancement of charmonium production with respect to the
binary scaling of the yields in pp collisions, as consequence of (re)generation; iii) observation of a colour
screening and (re)generation for the most tightly-bound quarkonium state, the Υ(1S).

∼

2 mc ∼

Interactions between gluons or light quarks of the QGP can lead to the production of cc pairs
if the energy in the centre of mass of the interaction is of the order of twice the charm quark mass
√ˆs
3 GeV. In Section 13.2 we have estimated that an initial temperature T0 of 600–800 MeV
could be reached at the HE-LHC. With these QGP temperatures a sizeable fraction of the gluons and light
quarks have energies larger than the charm quark mass and cc pairs can be produced in their interactions.
Figure 108 shows the prediction [1053] for the time-dependence of the cc rapidity density at mid-rapidity
in central Pb–Pb collisons at the HE-LHC. The value at the initial time τ0 corresponds to the initial hard-
scattering cross section. Both calculations show a rapid increase after τ0 with a ﬁnal value that is larger
by up to 20% than the initial production. This enhancement could be observed for the ﬁrst time at the
HE-LHC and provide a handle on the initial temperature of the QGP. The abundance of charm quarks
also has an effect on the QGP equation of the state: the inclusion of the charm quark in lattice-QCD
calculations results in a sizeable increase of P/T 4
nd.o.f. for T > 400 MeV, as discussed in the
context of the FCC [407].

∝

The measurements of the nuclear modiﬁcation factor of J/ψ at the LHC [746, 750, 1054] are
described by models that include dissociation caused by colour-charge screening and a contribution of
recombination (usually denoted (re)generation) from deconﬁned c and c quarks in the QGP [457, 1055,
1056]. The (re)generation contribution the charmonium yield is expected to be proportional to the square
of the rapidity density of cc pairs in the QGP. Therefore, it is predicted to be much larger at HE-LHC
than LHC energies, as a consequence of the larger hard-scattering production cross section of cc pairs
and the possible sizeable thermal production. This could lead to the observation of an enhancement of
J/ψ production with respect to binary scaling of the yield in pp collisions, i.e. RAA > 1, which would
be striking evidence of cc recombination from a deconﬁned QGP.

The measurement of Υ production would be particularly interesting at the high energies and tem-
peratures reached at the HE-LHC. The LHC data are consistent with a scenario in which the excited

180

states 2S and 3S are partially or totally suppressed by colour screening, while the 1S, which is the most
tightly bound state, has no or little direct melting. Its suppression by about 60% could be explained by
the lack of feed-down from the (melted) higher states and the effect of nuclear PDF suppression (see
e.g. Ref. [258] for a recent review). At HE-LHC energies, on the one hand, the temperature could be
large enough to determine a full melting even of the tightly-bound 1S state, on the other hand the large
abundance of bb pairs in the QGP could induce substantial Υ (re)generation. The role of the two effects
—degree of survival of initial bottomonia and contribution of (re)generation— could be separated by
means of precise measurements of the bb cross section and of the B meson and Υ RAA and elliptic ﬂow
v2 (the regenerated Υ states could exhibit a v2 such that 0 < vΥ

2 < vB
2 ).

13.4 Nuclear PDF measurements and search for parton saturation

Parton saturation [781, 782] is based on the idea that standard linear parton branching leads, at small
values of momentum fraction x, to parton densities so high that non-linear dynamics (like gluon recom-
bination) becomes important and parton densities are tamed to grow from power-like to logarithmically.
Non-linear effects are expected to become important when the density of gluons per unit transverse area
exceeds a certain limit, the saturation density.

In the framework of QCD collinear factorization, Parton Distribution Functions of nucleons inside
nuclei (nuclear PDFs) can be obtained in standard global ﬁt analysis with usual linear evolution equa-
tions. The differences with respect to free nuclon PDFs are parametrized in a nuclear modiﬁcation factor
RA
i (x, Q2) with i = g, qvalence, qsea (see e.g. Ref. [1057]). Collinear factorization is expected to break
down when the gluon phase-space becomes saturated. The onset of saturation is usually discussed in
terms of the saturation momentum Q2
S, deﬁned as the scale at which the transverse area of the nucleus
(cid:1)λeλy, with
is completely saturated and gluons start to overlap. It can be shown that Q2
0.3 [407]. Therefore, the regime of high gluon density is best accessed at a high-√sNN hadron
λ
collider with measurements at low pT and forward rapidity, which probe small x and small Q2. In order
to ﬁrmly establish the existence of this new high-energy regime of QCD and clarify the validity of the
different approaches to factorisation and evolution, new kinematic regions must be explored using higher
collision energies in order to have a large lever arm in Q2 in a region that, while perturbative, lies inside
the saturation domain. The HE-LHC extends the small-x coverage by a factor of two with respect to the
LHC, as shown in Fig. 109.

the proposed electron–hadron colliders (Electron-Ion Collider in the USA [799], Large Hadron Electron
Collider LHeC [798]). With kinematic reach at the TeV scale in the c.m.s. (Fig. 109, left), the electron–
nucleus option at the HE-LHC would be well-positioned to reach conclusive evidence for the existence
of a new non-linear regime of QCD. It would be clearly complementary with the p–Pb case, providing
a precise knowledge on the partonic structure of nucleons and nuclei and on the small-x dynamics. A
speciﬁc discussion can be found in the electron–nucleus part of the FCC Conceptual Design Report.

13.5 Photon–photon collisions

Photon–photon collisions in UPCs of proton [1058] and lead (Pb) beams [583] have been experimentally
observed at the LHC [820, 1059–1061]. The future prospects at the LHC are extensively discussed in
Sect. 11.2. Although the γ spectrum is harder for smaller charges –which favours proton over nuclear
beams in the production of heavy diphoton systems– each photon ﬂux scales with the squared charge of
107 in the case
the hadron, Z2, and thus γγ luminosities are extremely enhanced for ion beams (Z4 = 5
of Pb–Pb). The Pb beam Lorentz factor at HE-LHC (γ = 5 650) determines the “maximum” quasireal
photon energy ωmax = γ/RPb ≈
160 GeV, leading to photon–photon collisions up to centre-of-mass
energies of √sγγ ≈

320 GeV, twice larger than those reachable at the LHC.

The very rare elastic scattering of two photons in vacuum γγ

γγ was recently observed for the
ﬁrst time in UPCs at the LHC [810, 811]. At the HE-LHC, due to the higher diphoton masses reached,
this process may be sensitive to physics beyond the SM through new heavy charged particles contributing
to the virtual loop such as, e.g., from SUSY particles [1062]. Light-by-light (LbyL) scattering has also
been proposed as a tool to search for monopoles [1063], axions [1064], unparticles [1065], low-scale
gravity effects [1066], and non-commutative interactions [1067].
