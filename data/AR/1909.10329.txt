Neutrino oscillation experiments use heavy nuclear targets to achieve suﬃcient interaction rates.

Nuclear eﬀects are introduced in the experimental environment by the use of these targets and

need to be quantiﬁed as they add to the systematic errors.

In the low energy region(around 1

GeV) multinucleon events are also present along with Quasi Elastic(QE) and Delta interactions.

Therefore if these multinucleon events are not incorporated in the data set properly, we end up with

an inaccurate reconstruction of neutrino energy. In our work, we have illustrated the importance of

incorporation of multinucleon events for the reduction of systematic errors in physics predictions by

DUNE-Near Detector(ND). To achieve this we have presented the event distribution ratio of Ar/C,

Ar/Ar, and C/C as a function of squared four-momentum transfer by employing diﬀerent nuclear

models. This analysis recommends the addition of 2p2h or multinucleon events in the event sample

and promotes model with Random Phase Approximations(RPA) eﬀect for the analysis of the event

sample to overcome or reduce the systematic uncertainties.

INTRODUCTION

Precise measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters and understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions are

amongst the current goals to be achieved by the ongoing and future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. The

key to unraveling the basics of neutrino oscillation physics is the accurate estimation of the neutrino energy spectrum

since the neutrino oscillation probabilities depend on the neutrino energy. Neutrino beams have widely smeared energy

owing to the fact that they are produced from secondary decay products. Therefore, the energy of an incoming neutrino

must be reconstructed on an event by event basis by observing the properties of the ﬁnal state. In order to reconstruct

the neutrino energy precisely, suﬃcient knowledge of neutrino-nucleus interactions is apriori. But the environment of

the nucleus is such, that it modiﬁes the conﬁguration of the particles that come out of the nucleus along with the

kinematics of the interaction. The reconstruction of neutrino energy from the obtained ﬁnal state particles need to

be carefully examined because the particles produced at an initial neutrino-nucleus interaction may not be identical

with the ﬁnal state particles due to the inevitable nuclear eﬀects which are currently in a phase of understanding.

Essentially, the identiﬁcation of nuclear eﬀects that are inherently diﬀerent for neutrino and antineutrino scattering

is important and required to be investigated. This entails a detailed study of (anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering cross-

section which gets modiﬁed by the nuclear environment of heavy nuclear targets. To collect suﬃcient statistics,

long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments use massive nuclear targets i.e. Argon(A=40:

isovector component),

Calcium(A=40:

isoscalar target), Carbon(A=12:

isoscalar target), Oxygen(A=16:

the mass number) instead of low mass nuclear targets i.e. Hydrogen(A=1) and Deuterium(A=2). These targets

are comparatively cleaner targets as they are devoid of nuclear eﬀects but result in lesser statistics. Thus the data

sets obtained by using heavy nuclear targets have reduced statistical uncertainty but are still aﬄicted by systematic

uncertainties. Therefore in a heavier target, we need a handle to curb systematic errors arising due to nuclear eﬀects.

Much experimental cross-section data is available for carbon or hydrocarbon CH [1–5] but very few measurements are

there with heavy targets like Argon [6, 7], Water [8, 9] and Iron [10–12]. There is a need to enhance our understanding

regarding the nuclear eﬀects present in various targets as this will lead to the development of a better and uniform

nuclear model.

In addition to nuclear eﬀects, the few-GeV energy region is complicated because there is an overlap of many reaction

channels, physics mechanisms, etc. In this region, a signiﬁcant contribution arises from the two-body current also

known as two-particle-two-hole (2p2h) interaction process, whose experimental signature is 1µ− and 0π which is

indistinguishable from a true QE signature. These 2p2h events account for a high cross-section of QE-like events [13].

In 2p2h interaction, the incoming neutrino interacts with a correlated pair of nucleons. In this process(energy and

momentum transfer to two nucleons) two nucleons are ejected from the nucleus while in the QE interaction process a

single recoiling nucleon is ejected. Therefore, multinucleon events are identiﬁed by the presence of multiple nucleons

in the ﬁnal state. These multinucleon events have a dominant contribution from 2p2h processes [14]. The 2p-2h

events are also known as the Meson Exchange Current(MEC) events since the concerned initial state nucleons keep

on exchanging a pion. They are mostly present in the region between QE and ∆ resonance production. Ideally, for

a MEC event to occur, the energy transferred to the hadronic system must be more than that for a charged current

(CC)QE event. The hadronic re-interactions within the nuclear medium also known as Final State Interactions(FSI)

play a crucial role in modifying the initial state products that were actually produced at the initial neutrino-nucleon

interaction vertex. The current studies which are related to FSI eﬀects and their inclusion in Monte Carlo(MC)

codes can pose diﬃculty in the measurement of such events. Focussed studies on pion have been accomplished to

understand the pion production [15] data on nuclear targets. In addition to pion events, 2p2h or multinucleon events

can also appear as fake QE events and needs to be examined carefully to benchmark FSI eﬀects arising due to multiple

nucleons. These uncertainties are also a hurdle in the determination of the CP violating phase which is currently

unknown and is one of the most important question to be addressed. Determination of precise CP phase value is not

only important for verifying the baryon asymmetry of the Universe [16] but also for explaining the eﬀective mass of

neutrino [17].

Monte Carlo event generators serve as a tool to simulate neutrino scattering interactions and enhance our under-

standing of the interaction processes involved therein. These event generators are developed by diﬀerent theoretical

communities using diﬀerent nuclear models. The prediction of the neutrino-nucleus event rates for any particular

nuclear target along with the topology of ﬁnal state particles depends upon the theoretical consideration of the gen-

erators. It is critically important that input to these generators must contain the best knowledge of neutrino-nucleus

cross sections and nuclear eﬀects. Cross-sectional and nuclear uncertainties occurring in diﬀerent models, impact sig-

niﬁcantly the understanding of CP violation, mass hierarchy, and octant sensitivities [18–20]. There is an insuﬃcient

description of nuclear eﬀects in the Monte Carlo generators presently in use. For eg. the Fermi Gas Model [21, 22]

which is used to describe the nuclear structure includes fermi motion and Pauli blocking to deﬁne nuclear eﬀects in the

generators but are inadequate for a complete description of nuclear eﬀects especially for QE and ∆(1232) processes.

3

It is of crucial importance for the presently running experiments like T2K [23] and NOνA [24] and the future

long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments like DUNE [25] and HyperKamiokande [26] to very well understand

neutrino-nucleus interactions. One of the upcoming and the most promising neutrino oscillation experiment, the

Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment(DUNE) proposed to be built in the U.S., is designed to deliver precision

results related to neutrino oscillation physics. It will consist of a near detector(ND) [27] and a far detector(FD) [25]

placed at a distance of 575m and 1300km respectively from a mega-watt facility situated at Fermilab, producing

a muon-neutrino dominated beam. The FD will be located 1.5km underground at Sanford Underground Research

Facility(SURF), South Dakota, while the ND will be located at Fermilab. The FD will be built up using the liquid

Argon TPC(Time Projection Chamber) technology that will provide a detailed view of particle interactions. It will be

composed of four modules, 10 kton each, with a total mass of 40 kton and a ﬁducial mass of 34 kton. The high-pressure

gas TPC is one of the considered designs for the ND [27] which uses gaseous Argon as target material. The use of

gaseous Argon will enhance the capability of the ND to measure charged particles even with lower energies.

In this work, we present a simulation-based analysis using GENIE(version-2.12.6) [28]

for the DUNE-ND

HPgTPC(High Pressurised gas Time Projection Chamber) design to quantify the multi-nucleon contribution in CCQE

ν(¯ν)-nucleon interactions on Argon and Carbon targets. These targets are extensively used in neutrino detectors,

therefore this study will help in the estimation of the uncertainties stemming from the diﬀerence between nuclear

eﬀects in Argon and Carbon. To incorporate the eﬀects of long range nucleon-nucleon correlations we have selected a

model which includes the Random Phase Approximation(RPA) eﬀect in itself. The RPA eﬀect is prominent where the

four-momentum transferred to the nucleus during a neutrino-nucleon interaction is small, as the energy transferred

to the nucleus increases, the RPA eﬀect diminishes. The detailed study of this eﬀect has been discussed in [29].

We present our results as a function of the kinematic variable Q2(squared four-momentum transfer) which is sensitive

to the presence or absence of multinucleon correlations. To quantify the amount of uncertainty in the measurables

due to the use of diﬀerent targets, the event ratios such as Ar/C, Ar/Ar and C/C are estimated as a function of Q2.

We have analyzed the QE interaction by using the RPA correlations and adding to it the contribution from 2p2h

interactions. The motivation behind this combination is the improvement observed in the description of MiniBooNE

data [30–32], such an approach has proved to describe data by previous studies as well, which one can ﬁnd in [33, 34].

The uncertainty in the nuclear models for Carbon target was recently published by the MINERνA collaboration

[35] in which they have shown diﬀerence in physics analysis when diﬀerent QE models are used for the same set of

data sample. They performed the analysis by considering the data sample once with and without RPA eﬀect and by

adding a 2p2h event sample to the sample with the RPA eﬀect. The study suggests a requirement of modiﬁcation

in the models. More recent results from MINERνA collaboration [36] state that they could match their previous

result [35] only on further tuning the 2p2h model using an empirical ﬁt to the hadronic energy spectrum. Their

results indicate that diﬀerent models observe various level of tension with the data and no single model was able to

consistently reproduce the data.

The paper is organized in the following sections: In Section II, we describe the currently proposed design of the

DUNE-ND. The simulation and experimental details are described in Section III. Section IV includes a description of

the multinucleon eﬀect and its implications. The results and the conclusions drawn from our analysis are discussed

in Section V and VI respectively.

II. DUNE-ND DESIGN: HIGH-PRESSURE GAS TPC

4

The concept of a ND is introduced to achieve more detailed information regarding the kinematics of neutrino

interactions and it acts as a necessary factor in reducing ﬂux and background signal related uncertainties. An

eﬀective way to reduce the systematic uncertainties occurring in the neutrino oscillation experiments is by measuring

a non-oscillated event distribution at a ND system and further predicting the oscillated event distribution at the FD.

Designing the ND and FD with identical functionalities and targets helps in a maximum cancellation of correlated

uncertainties. In order to accomplish DUNE physics goals, a ND will play a crucial role by precisely determining

the neutrino energy spectrum, ﬂavor composition and the cross-section of various neutrino scattering processes. The

main advantage of the ND will be the collection of a large amount of unoscillated neutrino interaction event rates as

it will be exposed to an intense ﬂux of neutrinos. The reference design of the DUNE-ND [37–39] consists of three

main components: (1) A 50t LArTPC with pixelated readout (2) A multi-purpose tracker, the HPgTPC, kept in a

0.5T magnetic ﬁeld and surrounded by ECAL (3) A 8t 3-Dimensional Scintillator Tracker Spectrometer(3-DST).

The working principle of LArTPC to observe ν-Argon interactions will be similar to that of the FD while the

3-DST will look for neutrino-CH interactions and is designed to have a powerful detection capability for neutrons.

The DUNE HPgTPC [37] which is a ’copy’ of ALICE [40] TPC will be a single cylindrical volume of diameter 5.2m

and length 5m (2.5 m + 2.5 m drift). The gas in HPgTPC is proposed to be a mixture of Argon-CH4, with 90%

Argon and 10% CH4(known as P10 gas) and ﬁlled at a pressure of 10 Atm. In this mixture 97% of total interactions

will occur via the Argon nuclei. The HPgTPC will have a total volume of (cid:39) 1.8 ton and a ﬁducial volume of (cid:39) 1 ton.

It can detect low energy charged particles better than LArTPC due to the use of lower-density active material, which

allows the particles to travel a longer path before they ﬁnally stop. Charged particles can be tracked over the full 4π

solid angle within the ﬁducial volume of the HPgTPC tracker. It will be advantageous to use HPgTPC in conjunction

with LArTPC as both are using the same target material. Due to low energy detection thresholds, HPgTPC will

provide better vertex resolution for the identiﬁcation of low energy particles and will also help in the discrimination

of charged particles on an event by event basis. The detection thresholds that we have used in our work are-(1) we

apply a momentum cut of 200 MeV [27] for muons, which is equivalent to a total energy cut of 226 MeV. (2) The

HPgTPC will be able to detect protons with K.E. > 20MeV with an eﬃciency of more than 80%, so we have selected

a 20 MeV [27] cut on protons. While the minimum K.E. threshold for protons in the HPgTPC can be 3 MeV [37],

so this fact can be revised in a future analysis. (3) The K.E. cut for neutrons lies between 50 MeV to 700 MeV [27].

The oscillation studies by DUNE [41] have found that the HPgTPC detector is sensitive to 20% systematic variations

in the energy that neutrons may carry away.

III. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Using the DUNE-ND neutrino(anti-neutrino) ﬂux [42] in the energy range 0.125-20.125 GeV for Argon and Carbon

nuclei, we have generated an inclusive data sample of 1 million charged current νµ and ¯νµ events. The analysis is

performed by selecting pion-less events. The ν(¯ν) ﬂux used in our work is shown in Figure 1, it covers the energy

spectrum from hundreds of MeV to tens of GeV and peaks around 2.5 GeV decreasing signiﬁcantly after that and

becoming negligible after 10 GeV. The ﬂux of neutrinos is slightly higher than the anti-neutrino ﬂux around the

5

peak energy. The primary beam of protons in the energy range 60-120 GeV coming out from the main injector

accelerator is made to smash on a graphite target. This collision will result in the production of pions and kaons

which will be further focussed with the help of magnetic horns toward a 200m long decay pipe where they will decay

into neutrinos and leptons of all the ﬂavors. In this way, the NuMI(Neutrinos at Main Injector) beamline facility

at Fermilab will generate an intense, wide-band, high purity (anti)neutrino beam with an initial beam power of 1.2

MW. At 1.2 MW of beam power, 1.1 × 1021 protons are expected per year from the accelerator [25]. This facility will

be further upgraded to 2.4 MW. The interaction cross sections(νµ(¯νµ)-Argon and νµ(¯νµ)-Carbon) used in this work

include Quasi-Elastic(QE), Resonance(RES)(∆(1232) resonance production only and not higher mass resonances),

two particle-two hole(2p2h/MEC) and Deep Inelastic Scattering(DIS) interaction processes in both neutrino and

anti-neutrino modes. We have selected two diﬀerent physics models to study the QE interaction process viz. (1)

Llewellyn-Smith model (2) Nieves model.

By default in GENIE, the QE scattering is modeled using the Llewellyn-Smith model [43] mentioned as the Default

model in our work. While simulating the QE interactions the nuclear structure is described by the Relativistic Fermi

Gas model(RFG) [21, 22]. Further we tune GENIE’s description to simulate the QE interactions with the Nieves

model [44] which is based on RPA eﬀect. The Nieves model describes 0 pion events in such a way that QE(1p-1h)

cross-section gets modiﬁed in a non-trivial way. The movement of nucleons in the nuclear environment is treated

diﬀerently by the Default model and the Nieves model. The models diﬀer in actual distributions of nucleon momenta.

The nucleus is treated according to Global Fermi Gas(GFG) by the Default model while the Nieves model treats the

nucleus using a Local Fermi Gas(LFG) distribution. The GFG model implements a sphere of radius 250 MeV with

momentum uniformly distributed inside the sphere. This approach gives the simplest momenta distribution. In the

LFG model, a varying local nuclear density is seen by diﬀerent nucleons and it depends on the distance of the nucleon

from the center of the nucleus. Nuclei with higher density have a higher fermi limit. Momenta distribution predicted

from both the models can be found in [45].

The vector form factor in GENIE is deﬁned using BBBA05 [46] and the value of axial mass MA considered in
this work is 0.99 GeV/c2. For modeling 2p2h interactions, GENIE implements the model proposed by the Valencia

group [47]. The Rein-Sehgal model [48] is used for modeling the production of baryonic resonances in the neutral

and charged current interaction channels. For the modeling of FSI i.e. simulating re-scattering of pions and nucleons

in the nucleus, GENIE uses hA and hN as FSI models or the simulation package INTRANUKE [49, 50]. The DIS

interaction is simulated using the Bodek and Yang model[51].

The variation in νµ(¯νµ)-Argon(solid lines) and νµ(¯νµ)-Carbon(dashed lines) integrated cross section generated using

diﬀerent models as a function of neutrino energy is shown in Figure-2. The left panel is for neutrinos and the right

panel is for anti-neutrinos. In Figure 2, we can observe the diﬀerence in the cross-section prediction for the QE process

induced by the weak charged current interaction of νµ(¯νµ) scattering on Argon nuclei relevant for DUNE. We can

notice that neutrino cross-section estimated using the Default model for both the targets is almost the same but with

the Nieves model the cross-section for Carbon is slightly lesser as compared to Argon.

The diﬀerence in the cross-sections(Default model, model with RPA eﬀect, 2p2h and RPA+2p2h interactions) for
νµ(¯νµ)-Argon and νµ(¯νµ)-Carbon interaction at low ν(¯ν) energies i.e. for energies (cid:46) 1GeV is prominent. From Figure
2, we can observe that on combining the cross section obtained from the model including the RPA eﬀect(represented

by red line) with the cross-section contribution arising from the 2p2h process(represented by green line) shown by a

black line, is comparable with the CCQE cross-section as obtained from the Default model in GENIE(represented by

blue line) for neutrinos, but the same combination for anti-neutrinos shows some diﬀerence. From the right panel of

Figure 2, we observe that the ¯ν-Carbon cross-section is higher than the ¯ν-Argon cross-section when compared with

the Default, RPA, 2p2h and RPA+2p2h models.

The simulated ﬁnal state particles are categorized in two ways- (i)When no detector cuts are imposed, the particles

are represented as ”Calculated” or ”Cal” (ii)When detector cuts are imposed, the particles are represented as ”Visible”

or ”Vis”. Since not all the particles that emerge out of the various interaction processes can be detected by the detector,

in order to ﬁnd out the visible particles or those particles that can be seen by the detector, we apply certain kinetic

IV. MULTI-NUCLEON INTERACTIONS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS

A multi-nucleon interaction involves the interaction of a neutrino with multiple nucleons at the primary neutrino-

nucleon interaction vertex. If an interaction involves only 1 nucleon then it is referred to as 1p1h(1particle-1hole)

process, if 2 nucleons are involved then it is referred to as 2p-2h process or meson exchange currents(MEC). Further

generalization of such a process to ’n’ nucleons is referred to as ’np-nh’ process. A signiﬁcant contribution in the

number of events arising from multinucleon interaction to the inclusive neutrino charge current cross-section is studied

in [52], particularly for energies up to 1 GeV. The CCQE interactions occurring in this energy region(up to 1 GeV)

are contaminated with multi-nucleon ﬁnal states giving rise to the CCQE-like events. CCQE-like events are those

events that at the initial state of interaction are not pure QE process but the ﬁnal state products are similar to that

of the pure QE interaction. For instance, in the case when a neutrino interacts with a correlated pair of nucleons, in

the event of two nucleons being ejected out of the nucleus, such interaction will be classiﬁed as a 2p2h interaction.

But in case if the second nucleon is absorbed within the nuclear environment due to FSI, or if it is a neutron or if the

detector is incapable of detecting it owing to its low energy, then a 2p2h interaction would be a fake 1p1h interaction.

We know that the reconstruction of neutrino energy from the kinematics of the interaction products is of prime im-

portance for precision oscillation analysis. We can employ either of the two methods for neutrino energy reconstruction

i.e. (1) Kinematic method [53–56] (2) Calorimetric method[57, 58]. The kinematic method of energy reconstruction

is based on lepton kinematics i.e.

it requires information of the angle and momentum of the outgoing lepton. This

method is based on the assumption that the incoming neutrino interacts with a single nucleon which is assumed to

be at rest and the outgoing particles include a single nucleon and a lepton. As the energy of the incoming neutrino

increases, contribution from other processes like RES, DIS come into existence and may lead to many hadrons in the

ﬁnal state thus leading to incorrect estimation of neutrino energy.

Contrary to the kinematic method, the calorimetric method of neutrino energy reconstruction requires information

of all the visible ﬁnal state particles on an event by event basis i.e. summing up of the energy deposited by all ﬁnal

state particles in the detector and thus allowing for accurate reconstruction of neutrino energy. It is applicable to all

types of ﬁnal states unlike the kinematic method which can be used only for QE event reconstruction. But even this

method poses challenges in the way of precise neutrino energy reconstruction. One of the challenges is the accurate

reconstruction of the ﬁnal state hadrons, where neutrons and very low energy protons might escape detection. The

calorimetric method thus depends upon the capability of the detector in reconstructing hadronic ﬁnal states. The re-

construction of neutrino energy is also hindered due to the inevitable nuclear eﬀects that may lead to a non-negligible

amount of missing energy [57]

Applying the calorimetric approach i.e.

summing up all the outgoing particles, reconstructed neutrino energy,

[57] can be calculated as-

V. RESULT AND DISCUSSION

From Figure 3 we note that on considering the RPA eﬀect by tuning the Nieves model in our simulation we observe

a signiﬁcant shift in the hadronic energy distribution pattern towards the higher energy, roughly by ≈ 300 MeV from

the hadronic energy distribution pattern obtained from the Default model. In Figure 4 and Figure 5, where total event
distribution is plotted as a function of Q2 and q3 respectively, we can observe a similar shift in the event distribution

pattern, since these kinematics variables directly depend on hadronic energy.

It is evident from Figures 4 and 5, on implementation of the model with RPA eﬀect(green and black lines) there
is a diﬀerence in the total event distribution pattern as a function of Q2 and q3 as compared to the event rate

distribution pattern that results from the Default model(blue and red lines) for ν(¯ν)-Argon and ν(¯ν)-Carbon. Since

RPA correlations describe strongly interacting nucleons, these are responsible for changing the electroweak coupling

strengths of the bound nucleons with respect to the free nucleon values. RPA modiﬁes the low lying states of the

nucleus by changing the potential which causes a screening eﬀect. This screening eﬀect reduces the probability of the

weak interaction which results in a reduction of QE weak interaction cross-section. We can also notice this trend from

Figure 2(left and right panels), which depicts the reduced cross-section on the implementation of the RPA model(red

line) when compared to the Default model(blue line) for both neutrino and anti-neutrino. Therefore in the above Q2

distribution plots, we can observe a reduction in the event rates when RPA eﬀect is taken into account. We also note
from the Figures 4 and 5, that ¯ν-Argon and ¯ν-Carbon event rates as a function of Q2 and q3 are higher than the

ν-Argon and ν-Carbon event rates. This enhancement is signiﬁcant when the Default model is implemented while

with RPA correlations the enhancement is marginal for both Argon and Carbon. The diﬀerence between neutrino

and anti-neutrino can be attributed to the fact that neutrons give diﬀerent contributions to the ﬁnal state energy.

One can also study the energy spectrum of individual hadrons(neutrons and protons) as a function of neutrino energy

In an attempt to quantify the systematic uncertainties introduced due to nuclear eﬀects we have estimated the

ratio of events as a function of Q2 for the two targets viz., Argon and Carbon and presented in Figure 6. The ratio

of Ar/C is calculated to address the diﬀerence that will incur in the physics results due to the use of diﬀerent target

material. The ratio of events as a function of Q2 for ν-Ar/C is shown in the left panel of Figure 6, whereas the right

panel shows the distribution of ¯ν-Ar/C. We have checked the diﬀerence arising due to the consideration of the same

models in diﬀerent target materials. In the left panel, the blue lines(solid-Cal and dashed-Vis) represent the ratio of

ν-Ar/C for the Default model whereas the red lines(solid-Cal and dashed-Vis) represent the ratio of ν-Ar/C for the

RPA model, the right panel has the same description for anti-neutrinos. We notice that the model with RPA eﬀect

shows minimal distortion from unity (≤ 1 GeV 2) for both Cal and Vis datasets. But the Default model shows much

deviation from unity and a dip around 0.5 GeV 2 indicating larger systematic uncertainty. The event distribution

ratio as a function of Q2 presented in the right panel for anti-neutrinos shows some symmtery with the RPA model

below 1 GeV 2.

Further to check the systematic uncertainty in the models itself, we have estimated the ratio of event distributions

as a function of Q2 with RPA eﬀect ON(RPA-ON) to RPA eﬀect OFF (RPA-OFF) for the same target material

i.e. Argon and Carbon and is represented in the left(ν) and right(¯ν) panels of Figure 7. We found that the ratio of

RPA-ON/RPA-OFF(blue and red lines for Argon and Carbon respectively) as a function of Q2 for the same target

increases continuously from 0 to 1 GeV 2 which implies a signiﬁcant amount of uncertainties below 1GeV 2. Whereas

on the addition of 2p2h contribution(indicated by green and black lines for Argon and Carbon respectively) to the

MC datasets(both Cal and Vis), a signiﬁcant improvement in the model prediction is observed. We notice that the

ratio of RPA-ON+2p2h/RPA-OFF becomes nearly constant for values between 1.2 to 1.4 but for anti-neutrinos this

range falls between 1.4 to 1.8. Also for neutrinos, the Cal and Vis data sets mostly overlap but a discrepancy is

observed for anti-neutrinos where Vis and Cal datasets have more distortions.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

There is a dearth of knowledge about the interaction of neutrinos with nucleons bound inside the nucleus. To

understand neutrino-nucleon interactions, we should have a good understanding of the hadronic physics of these

interactions since it is the key to understand nuclear eﬀects. The challenge is to develop the models which can describe

the complete time-development of a neutrino-nucleon interaction for all the processes. There are large uncertainties in

(¯ν)ν-nucleon cross section in the scattering region governed by the QE interactions. Reaction mechanisms involving

two particles and two holes that arise in the target nucleus are one of the sources of systematic uncertainties in

the QE scattering region and are required to be addressed carefully as they play a signiﬁcant role in the energy

region relevant for the DUNE experiment [59]. Processes like multinucleon interactions are still neither modeled nor

constrained properly in the event generators currently in use. We must attempt to tune the available models as much

as possible so that the DUNE-ND complex can deliver precision physics.

We ﬁnd from Figure 7, that the Nieves model along with the 2p2h interaction sample result in a marked reduction

in systematic uncertainties for both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. Thus, we can say that incorporation of 2p2h

interactions combined with the RPA correlations may be considered by DUNE to reduce systematic uncertainties

occurring in the low energy regime and at the same time, the models must be tuned to reduce the uncertainties and

checked for both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos.
