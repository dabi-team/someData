ABSTRACT

Context. The solar dipole moment at cycle minimum is considered to be the most reliable precursor with which to determine the
amplitude of the subsequent cycle. Numerical simulations of the surface ﬂux transport (SFT) model are widely used to eﬀectively
predict the dipole moment at cycle minimum. An algebraic method was recently proposed to quickly predict the contribution of an
active region (AR) to the axial dipole moment at cycle minimum instead of SFT simulations. The method assumes a bipolar magnetic
region (BMR) conﬁguration of ARs, however most ARs are asymmetric in conﬁguration of opposite polarities, or have more complex
conﬁgurations. Such ARs evolve signiﬁcantly diﬀerently from those of BMR approximations.
Aims. We propose a generalized algebraic method to describe the axial dipole contribution of an AR with an arbitrary conﬁguration,
and evaluate its eﬀectiveness compared to the BMR-based method.
Methods. We employ mathematical deductions to obtain the generalized method. We compare the results of the generalized method
with SFT simulations of observed ARs, artiﬁcially created BMRs, and ARs with more complex conﬁgurations. We also compare the
results with those from the BMR-based method.
Results. The generalized method is equivalent to the SFT model, and precisely predicts the contributions of ARs to the dipole
moment, but has a much higher computational eﬃciency. Although the BMR-based method has similar computational eﬃciency to
the generalized method, it is only accurate for symmetric bipolar ARs. The BMR-based method systematically overestimates the
dipole contributions of asymmetric bipolar ARs, and randomly miscalculates the contributions of more complex ARs.
Conclusions. The generalized method provides a quick and precise quantiﬁcation of the contribution of an AR to solar cycle evolution,
which paves the way for application in physics-based solar cycle predictions.

1. Introduction

Variations of the long-term magnetic activity of the Sun are the
major source of inﬂuence on the climate of the Solar System
and the surrounding space, aﬀecting the solar wind, the helio-
sphere, and the related planetary environments (Mursula et al.
2007; Nandy & Martens 2007). The long-term development of
the solar magnetic ﬁeld is described by the solar dynamo mech-
anism, of which the elementary mode is the 22-year magnetic
cycle. As described by the Babcock-Leighton dynamo (Bab-
cock 1961; Leighton 1964, 1969), the initial poloidal ﬁeld at
cycle minimum, which is mostly composed of the polar ﬁeld,
is the source of the toroidal ﬁeld responsible for the solar ac-
tive regions during the solar cycle (Jiang et al. 2013; Cameron
& Schüssler 2015). Hence, the polar ﬁeld at cycle minimum is
often regarded as the precursor of the strength of the next cy-
cle (Schatten et al. 1978; Wang 2017; Jiang et al. 2018; Petrovay
2020). As the polar ﬁeld is subject to diﬀerent deﬁnitions, the ax-
ial dipole moment of the surface magnetic ﬁeld is often studied
as an equivalent. The dipole moment is introduced by active re-
gions (ARs) that bear initial dipole moments as a result of Joy’s
law (Hale et al. 1919). The dipole moment of an AR evolves as
the surface ﬂux transport (SFT) process takes place, and con-

tributes to the dipole moment at cycle minimum, hereafter re-
ferred to as the ﬁnal dipole moment. Therefore, the contribution
of an AR to the ﬁnal dipole moment quantiﬁes its inﬂuence on
the long-term development of the solar cycle, as described by the
dipole index introduced by Jiang et al. (2019), and by the active
region degree of rogueness (ARDoR) index introduced by Nagy
et al. (2020).

The contribution of an AR to the solar cycle is commonly ob-
tained by numerical simulations based on the SFT model (e.g.,
DeVore et al. 1985; Wang et al. 1989; van Ballegooijen et al.
1998; Mackay et al. 2002; Jiang et al. 2014). Meanwhile, it can
also be deduced from an algebraic form that is directly depen-
dent on the properties of the AR, where actual simulations are
not necessary. As shown by the SFT simulations of Jiang et al.
(2014), and by the mathematical deductions of Petrovay et al.
(2020), the initial dipole introduced by an AR, Di, and its con-
tribution to the ﬁnal dipole, D f , follow Eq. (1)

where λ is the emerging latitude of the AR, and A and λR are

Equation (1) assumes that the ARs emerge in the form of
bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs). Hereafter we refer to Eq. (1)

as the BMR-based method. The BMR approximation is unreal-
istic for ARs. The two polarities of an AR may be asymmetrical
in size and ﬂux, aﬀecting its surface evolution and contribution
to the ﬁnal dipole (Iijima et al. 2019). An AR with more com-
plex conﬁgurations, for example a δ-type AR, may deviate from
or even be opposite to the predictions of the BMR-based method
(Jiang et al. 2019). Generally, ARs with real conﬁgurations pro-
duce notably diﬀerent dipole evolutions from those produced by
their corresponding BMR approximations (Yeates 2020). Hence,
it is not precise to include the BMR approximation when quanti-
fying the contributions of an AR to the solar cycle, and the con-
ﬁguration of the ARs should be considered. The current func-
tional form of the BMR-based method cannot include AR con-
ﬁgurations directly. The Gaussian function in Eq. (1) assigns
the whole AR with a certain latitude. However, as we decom-
pose a realistic AR into smaller bipolar components, the lati-
tudes of these regions are diﬀerent. Hence, an algebraic method
is required that includes AR conﬁgurations by considering their
smaller components. As the SFT model is linear when nonlin-
ear feedback from magnetic ﬁelds to the velocity proﬁles (e.g.,
inﬂows toward activity belts, see Gizon 2004; Jiang et al. 2010;
Cameron & Schüssler 2010; Nagy et al. 2020) is not consid-
ered, the function describing such elementary components con-
tributing to the ﬁnal dipole should be linearly addable, so that we
can divide a complex AR into its elementary components, evalu-
ate the contributions of these elementary components separately,
and add them together. Hence, such an algebraic method will be
capable of predicting the ﬁnal dipole contribution of an arbitrary
AR, and produce a valid quantiﬁcation of its contribution to the
solar cycle without SFT numerical simulations.

We propose a generalized algebraic method to predict the
ﬁnal dipole contribution of ARs with arbitrary magnetic conﬁg-
urations, by generalizing the analytic approach of Petrovay et
al. (2020). We use SFT simulations of ARs to assess the ac-
curacy of the ﬁnal dipole contribution predictions of the new
generalized method, and the predictions of the previous BMR-
based method. We demonstrate that the generalized method is a
theoretical approximation and quick implementation of the SFT
simulations, while the previous BMR-based method is only its
special case. As AR conﬁgurations are considered, the new gen-
eralized method produces better predictions of ﬁnal dipole than
previous methods, and soundly quantiﬁes the contributions of
arbitrary ARs to solar cycle evolution.

The present article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we de-
scribe the mathematical foundations and deduction of the gener-
alized algebraic method. In Sect. 3 we introduce the SFT simu-
lation model which is applied to evaluate the algebraic methods.
In Sect. 4 we evaluate the algebraic methods with the results of
SFT simulations. We discuss and conclude in Sect. 5.

2. Deduction of the algebraic method to predict the

dipole contribution of ARs

The basic equation of the SFT model is the radial component of
the magnetic induction equation at the solar surface, as shown
by Eq. (2), where B (θ, φ, t) is the surface radial ﬁeld at a cer-
tain colatitude θ, longitude φ, and time t. Here, Ω (θ) denotes the
diﬀerential rotation, v (θ) the meridional ﬂow, and η the super-
granular diﬀusion. New ﬂux emergence is inserted as S (θ, φ, t).
As the velocity proﬁles are usually predetermined and indepen-

dent of B, the equation is linear in terms of B, thus allowing the
superposition of contributions of diﬀerent magnetic ﬂux sources.

As an emerged AR evolves according to the SFT processes,
the generated cross-equatorial ﬂux is important for the large-
scale surface ﬁeld and the ﬁnal dipole moment (Cameron et al.
2013; Wang 2017). The cross-equatorial ﬂux is a result of the
competition between diﬀusion and meridional ﬂow, and leads
to a total ﬂux diﬀerence between the two hemispheres. The
ﬂux diﬀerence determines the ﬁnal dipole moment. The ana-
lytic approach of deducing the BMR-based algebraic method by
Petrovay et al. (2020) follows this concept. These latter authors
discussed the cross-equatorial ﬂux ratio generated by a unipolar
ﬂux patch with a Gaussian proﬁle,

at a certain latitude λ0 with a certain width σ0. Assuming a near-
equator Cartesian approximation where the ﬁrst-order Taylor ex-
pansion of the meridional ﬂow was considered, Petrovay et al.
(2020) proved that the fraction of cross-equatorial ﬂux of the
Gaussian ﬂux patch on the northern hemisphere is as follows:

where R is the solar radius, and ∆u is the derivative of the merid-
ional ﬂow at the equator. Hence, the cross-equatorial ﬂux is de-
pendent on the initial conﬁguration as well as the transport terms.
They then assumed two ﬂux patches of diﬀerent polarities, that
is, BMRs, and proved Eq. (1).

We consider an arbitrary ﬂux region rather than the BMR
form. Because the SFT model shown by Eq. (2) is linear, the
contribution of an arbitrary AR to the ﬁnal dipole moment is a
linear addition of the contribution of its smaller parts. Consid-
ering the limit, an arbitrary AR can be decomposed into inﬁnite
sizeless “points”. Such points are unipolar regions correspond-
ing to magnetogram pixels in reality. We know that

where δ (λ − λ0) is the Dirac δ function and a is a constant. From
this perspective, Eqs. (4) and (5) also hold for such a “point”. The
diﬀerence is that λR in this case is dependent on transport terms
only.

The ﬂux diﬀerence between the two hemispheres generated
by the point can be deduced from the cross-equatorial ﬂux. As-
suming that at cycle minimum the polar ﬁeld follows a certain
proﬁle determined by the balance of diﬀusion and meridional
ﬂow, the ﬁnal dipole moment generated by the point D f,point is

This is the generalized algebraic method we introduce. Any arbi-

ﬁguration. In practice, the numerical integration is carried out
following the trapezoidal rule in this article. In this way, D f is
calculated by summing the ﬁnal dipole contributions of all pixels
of the AR.

The proportion ratio A0 originates from the proportional re-
lationship between the axial dipole moment and the ﬂux diﬀer-
ence between the two hemispheres. As mentioned above, A0 is
determined by the balance of diﬀusion and meridional ﬂow, so
it is dependent on the strength of diﬀusion and the meridional
ﬂow proﬁle. Hence, A0 varies with SFT models with diﬀerent
transport parameters, but the proportional relationship is not af-
fected by the exact transport parameters. A0 is a scaling factor
when the parameters of the SFT model are given. We obtain A0
by considering the simulations of the SFT model, ﬁtting A0 from
the results of algebraic methods and SFT simulations.

The generalized algebraic method signiﬁcantly speeds up the
acquisition of ﬁnal dipole contributions for ARs compared to
SFT simulations, because actual numerical calculations are no
longer required. Compared to the BMR-based method (Petrovay
et al. 2020), the generalized algebraic method requires approx-
imately the same amount of computation time, considering the
calculation methods. The generalized method described by Eq.
(8) is an integration over the evaluated AR. Meanwhile, the
BMR-based method requires the initial dipole moment Di of the
AR, and so integrating over the AR is also required. The integra-
tion is,
Di = 3
4π

B (θ, φ) cos θ sin θdθdφ.

(cid:90) (cid:90)

(9)

Hence, if the generalized method and the BMR-based method
adopt the same numerical integration algorithm, and are applied
to the same magnetogram, the computation time will be similar.

3. Simulations based on the SFT model
To justify the generalized method, and to compare its eﬀective-
ness with the previous BMR-based method, we ran SFT simula-
tions for some ARs, and compared the results of the simulations
with those of the prediction methods. We use an SFT code to
solve Eq. (2) based on Baumann et al. (2004). The spatial res-
olution of the code is 360×180, and its time interval is 1 day.
The spatial part is decomposed into spherical harmonics up to
order 63, and the temporal part is solved with the fourth-order
Runge-Kutta method.

The diﬀerential rotation proﬁle is adopted from Snodgrass
(1983). The meridional ﬂow proﬁle is adopted from van Balle-
gooijen et al. (1998) with the ﬂow speed set as 11 ms−1. The

supergranular diﬀusion is 500 km2s−1. Under this set of trans-
port parameters, λR for the generalized method is equal to 9◦.45.
We use this value in the following evaluations of the generalized
method.

Each AR is simulated separately for 10 years to reach the
ﬁnal state and obtain the ﬁnal dipole contribution. To compare
with the results of the BMR-based method, each AR is related
to its latitude, represented by the average latitude weighted by
unsigned ﬂux. We use two kinds of ARs in the simulations: the
ARs from observations of a continuous time period, and the ARs
artiﬁcially created from predetermined parameters.

For observational ARs, we choose ARs during Carrington
rotations (CRs) 2145-2159, as these ARs are recognized as im-
portant in the cycle development of cycle 24, and, as shown by
the SFT simulations of Wang et al. (2020), contribute a large
fraction of the ﬁnal dipole. Here we adopt the 84 ARs identiﬁed
and used in the work of these latter authors, in which the charac-
teristics and evolution properties are discussed in detail. Some of
these ARs bear complex conﬁgurations instead of simple BMR
form, as presented by Wang et al. (2020).

√

For artiﬁcially created ARs, we consider bipolar ARs and
ARs with complex conﬁgurations. The bipolar ARs are com-
posed of two Gaussian ﬂux patches of opposite polarity (Bau-
mann et al. 2004; Jiang et al. 2014). The maximum magnetic
ﬁeld strength is set to 250 G, and the tilt angles of the bipo-
lar ARs are determined by Joy’s law, α = k
|λ|, where α is
the tilt angle and k = 1.3 is a typical value of the Joy’s coeﬃ-
cient (Cameron et al. 2010; Jiang 2020). The latitudes considered
range from 0◦ to 35◦ with a 5◦ interval, covering eight latitudes
in total. In this form, the bipolar ARs at 0◦ latitude have no tilts,
and so their initial dipoles are also zero. In order to show the
inﬂuence of AR conﬁgurations to the prediction methods, we in-
clude morphological asymmetries of the two polarities, which
were introduced by Iijima et al. (2019). With an asymmetry fac-
tor fasym, the maximum ﬁeld strengths Bmax and the widths of the
Gaussian proﬁles σ0 are modiﬁed as,

fasym = Bmax,L
Bmax,F

=

(cid:32) σ0,F
σ0,L

(cid:33)2

,

(10)

where the subscript L indicates the leading polarity and the sub-
script F indicates the following polarity, identical to the factor
deﬁned by Iijima et al. (2019). In this way, the following polar-
ity is more diﬀusive. We consider the cases where fasym equals 1,
2, and 3, and refer to them as the symmetric, weakly asymmetric,
and strongly asymmetric cases, respectively.

To compare with the results of bipolar ARs, we also create
ARs with more complex conﬁgurations at certain latitudes. The
ARs are modeled after NOAA AR 12673, which was studied in
detail by Jiang et al. (2019). As shown by their work, AR 12673
is a typical case where the SFT model produces signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent results from the BMR-based model as a result of its com-
plex conﬁguration. Here we ﬂip it into the northern hemisphere
to compare with the aforementioned artiﬁcially generated bipo-
lar ARs, and shift its latitudinal locations of each pixel in the
equal-latitude projection. The latitudes of the complex ARs, de-
ﬁned as the area-weighted ﬂux centers, are now also from 0◦ to
35◦ with a 5◦ interval.

4. Evaluating the generalized algebraic method with

SFT simulations

4.1. Evaluation using observed ARs

We compare the simulated ﬁnal dipole moment for the observed
ARs during CRs 2145-2159 with the results from the algebraic
prediction methods. For the generalized algebraic method, we
compute the integration for each isolated AR over the whole so-
lar surface, with the constant λR given in Sect. 3. As the SFT
simulations decompose the surface magnetic ﬁeld into spherical
harmonics up to order 63, we also apply the integration over the
ARs with their spherical harmonics components up to order 63,
while the higher orders are not included in the integration for
consistency in numerical methods. The value of the coeﬃcient
A0 in Eq. (8) is 0.21, which is obtained by linear ﬁtting the sim-
ulated dipole contributions to the results of Eq. (8).

The results of the simulated ﬁnal dipole moment and cor-
responding ﬁnal dipole moment predicted by the generalized
method for each AR are displayed in Fig. 1(a). As shown, the
predictions of the generalized algebraic method are almost iden-
tical to the results of SFT simulations. The maximum diﬀerence
between the predicted and simulated ﬁnal dipole is 0.009G (11%
of the dipole contribution from the AR that generates the maxi-
mum diﬀerence), and is represented by the gray shaded area. As
this area shows, the error of the ﬁnal dipole is actually not di-
rectly related to the absolute value of the ﬁnal dipole. The error
may originate from the deviation from the near-equator Carte-
sian assumption and the lowest order Taylor approximation of
the meridional ﬂow when we deduce the algebraic method. The
method is a practical and eﬀective simpliﬁcation of the SFT
model, as expected by the mathematical arguments in Sect. 2.

We compare the results of the generalized algebraic method
with the BMR-based method. To utilize the BMR-based method,
we calculate the initial dipole moment Di for each AR. Similarly,
the integration is calculated based on the ARs with their spher-
ical harmonics components up to order 63. The initial dipole
moments are multiplied by corresponding contribution factor
D f /Di. According to Eq. (5), λR depends on σ0, the initial Gaus-
sian width of the polarities, which is not a well-deﬁned quan-
tity for ARs with real conﬁgurations. Hence, we adopt the value
λR = 10◦.06 ﬁtted from the symmetric bipolar ARs in Sect. 4.2,
in which case λR follows the deﬁnition of Eq. 5. The results of
the BMR-based method are displayed in Fig. 1(b). The scatter
of the points is considerably larger than from the generalized
method. The maximum diﬀerence between predictions and sim-
ulation is now 0.06G (56% of the dipole contribution of the AR),
produced by NOAA AR 11990 on CR 2157. AR 11990 is located
within the corresponding area of AR 11967, which is a complex
βγδ-type AR on CR 2156. The remnant of AR 11967 causes the
identiﬁed AR 11990 to be very asymmetric, resulting in a large
deviation. This shows that the BMR-based method is not accu-
rate when the ﬂux emergence is in more complex forms.

To further demonstrate the deviation of D f /Di with realistic
AR conﬁgurations from the values with the BMR approxima-
tions, we plot D f /Di for each AR in Fig. 2. As shown, while
there appears to be a Gaussian trend expressed by Eq. (1) and
indicated by the red curve, many points deviate from the trend,
which is similar to the results of Yeates (2020). Hence, the BMR-
based method is limited for realistic ARs, while the generalized
method produces more reliable predictions as AR conﬁgurations
are considered. Please note that although Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 2
show that the BMR-based method tends to give lower predicted
ﬁnal dipole moments, this is not necessary the case. The trend

results from the limited ARs considered here. When a substan-
tial number of ARs are considered, there is no trend, as shown
by Fig. 8 of Yeates (2020). The BMR-based method could give
a stronger or lower predicted ﬁnal dipole moment depending on
the conﬁguration of the AR; we discuss this further in Sect. 4.2.

4.2. Evaluation using artiﬁcially created ARs

In order to evaluate the generalized method, and to explicitly
show the diﬀerence between the generalized method and the pre-
vious BMR-based method, we employ both methods to predict
the four sets of artiﬁcially created ARs. A set of examples of the
ARs is displayed in Fig. 3. As shown, the ARs with diﬀerent de-
grees of asymmetry diﬀer in their following polarities, while the
complex AR is completely diﬀerent from the bipolar ARs.

The artiﬁcially created ARs are simulated to get their corre-
sponding ﬁnal dipole contributions. We also calculate the results
of the two algebraic prediction methods for the ARs as described
in Sect. 4.1. The corresponding contribution factors D f /Di are
plotted in Fig. 4. As the bipolar ARs at the equator do not have
an initial dipole because of the zero tilt angle, they are not shown
here. As shown, the diﬀerent cases do not follow a uniform trend.
The bipolar ARs with diﬀerent degrees of asymmetry (marked
with black diamonds, purple triangles, and blue squares) ap-
pear to show separate trends. The bipolar ARs with more dif-
fusive following polarities are systematically overestimated by
the BMR-based method, as they all appear under the trend line.
This indicates that they contribute less to the ﬁnal dipole moment
as more ﬂux of the following polarity tends to migrate across the
equator, which agrees with the results of Iijima et al. (2019).
For the strongly asymmetric cases, the contributions predicted
by the BMR-method are even opposite to those suggested by
SFT simulations at some latitudes. The results of the complex
ARs based on the conﬁguration of AR 12673 (marked with red
asterisks) do not follow a trend at all, and the contribution factor
even becomes negative for some cases, as ﬁrst shown by Jiang
et al. (2019). In summary, for the asymmetric bipolar ARs il-
lustrated by the artiﬁcially created ones, the BMR-based method
systematically overestimates the dipole contribution, while for
the complex ARs, the dipole contribution given by the BMR-
based method does not show a systematic trend.

The results of the artiﬁcially created ARs are consistent with
the results of observed ARs in Sect. 4.1. From the perspective of
Eq. (8), the major contribution of an AR to the ﬁnal dipole origi-
nates from its components with lower latitudes and higher ﬂuxes,
instead of the properties of the whole AR. Hence, for ARs with
irregularly distributed ﬂux, the ﬁnal dipole contributions deviate
from the predictions of the BMR-based method, which only con-
siders the overall properties of the ARs. The deviation depends
on the exact conﬁguration of the ARs instead of a systematic
property. Even for ARs with the same shape, a slight change in
latitude causes a substantial alteration of the contributions, as
shown by the red asterisks in Fig. (4). As many observed ARs
are not bipolar in reality, the BMR-based method, instead of re-
vealing a systematic deviation, tends to randomly miscalculate
the results.

Now we deal with the four kinds of conﬁgurations of ARs lo-
cated at diﬀerent latitudes in the same way as Fig. 1. The results
are shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5(a) indicates that the generalized al-
gebraic method still produces reliable ﬁnal dipole predictions for
all cases. The diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the ARs do not notably
aﬀect the results. On the contrary, the BMR-based method can-
not produce reliable predictions for the asymmetric or complex
cases (Fig. 5(b)). The asymmetric bipolar ARs (purple triangles

ric BMRs, and the complex ARs (red asterisks) are completely
irregularly distributed. As clariﬁed above, this can be explained
by the fact that the parameter λR is not ﬁxed when the initial
conﬁguration of the ﬂux patches is not as diﬀusive as that of
other ARs, and is completely ill-deﬁned for complex ARs. The
generalized method on the other hand is not aﬀected by this is-
sue, as it does not involve BMR assumptions. The generalized
method maintains its accuracy regardless of diﬀerent AR con-
ﬁgurations. We explicitly show that the generalized method is
a more generalized approximation of the SFT model, while the
previous BMR-based method considers only a special case.

5. Discussion and conclusions

We introduce a generalized algebraic method to calculate the
contribution of an arbitrary AR to the axial dipole moment at

cycle minimum, which is the precursor of the strength of the
next cycle. The method is a time-eﬃcient alternative to the SFT
simulations for prediction of the ﬁnal dipole contributions of the
ARs. The method describes the cross-equatorial ﬂux transport
originating from a point magnetic ﬂux patch, i.e., described by
a Dirac δ function proﬁle ﬂux, and deduces the associated ﬁ-
nal dipole moment contribution. The contribution of an arbitrary
AR to the ﬁnal dipole moment is an integration of the contri-
butions of the points covering the whole AR area. This method
is a generalization of the previous Gaussian contribution proﬁle
method, which assumes a ﬂux emergence in the form of BMRs
with ﬁxed width (Petrovay et al. 2020). By comparing to sim-
ulations of artiﬁcially created BMRs with diﬀerent degrees of
asymmetry and more complex ARs, we explicitly show that the
generalized method is not aﬀected by AR conﬁgurations as the
BMR-based method is. The generalized method produces more
accurate dipole predictions compared to the BMR-based method

for realistic ARs, and requires considerably less computation
time than SFT simulations. On the contrary, the BMR-based
method tends to systematically overestimate the contributions of
asymmetric bipolar ARs, and randomly miscalculate the contri-
butions of ARs with complex conﬁgurations. Hence, the gener-
alized method oﬀers a quick alternative to SFT simulations for
precisely quantifying the inﬂuence of an AR on solar cycle evo-
lution, and can be used to accelerate and improve physics-based
solar cycle predictions.

While the generalized algebraic method we introduce can
precisely predict AR contributions to the ﬁnal dipole moment,
the algebraic method does not produce the whole process of the
development of the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld, and so SFT sim-
ulations are still required to understand the development of solar
magnetism at the solar surface and the heliosphere. The alge-
braic method does not replace realistic SFT simulations.

The generalized algebraic method is valid for any linear
kinematic SFT model regardless of transport parameters and pro-
ﬁles. An SFT model with diﬀerent assumptions of the transport
terms can also be described by the algebraic method, but the
exact parameters of the method may be diﬀerent. Therefore, the

method is universal for SFT models, but the results of the method
are limited to a speciﬁc SFT model with a set of given transport
parameters. When we use the algebraic method to quantify AR
contributions to the solar cycle in the future, the parameters λR
and A0 should be derived from the transport parameters of the
speciﬁc SFT model we adopt.

The generalized algebraic method is a theoretical approxi-
mation and a quick implementation of the SFT model, while
the previous BMR-based method is its special case. The SFT
model describes the emerged ARs after reaching their decay
phase, not the ﬂux emergence of ARs. The generalized algebraic
method cannot describe the emergence of ARs either. Therefore,
the ARs should be accurately identiﬁed on their decay phase to
precisely quantify their contributions to the solar cycle. For ARs
that emerge in spatial and temporal proximity to others, automat-
ically identifying their exact decay phase can be problematic, as
the ﬂuxes of diﬀerent ARs often superpose one another as they
evolve (Wang et al. 2020). This problem should be considered in
the analysis and characterization of the inﬂuence of ARs on the
solar cycle.

(b) presents the results of the BMR-based method. We note that for panel (b), three points of the complex ARs lie beyond the display range, with
the most extreme point (-0.092,-0.22).

The generalized method requires the real conﬁgurations of
ARs, and so the spatial resolution of the input ARs needs to be
carefully considered. To what extent the details of the ARs is re-
quired is unclear. Theoretically, the SFT model implements the
supergranular diﬀusion, which is introduced by the random walk
process from the supergranulation convective currents (Leighton
1964). This potentially limits the resolution of the SFT model
and its algebraic equivalent method. Further numerical and ob-
servational studies are needed to clarify the required resolution
of ARs, such as the previous eﬀorts of Schrijver (2001), Meyer
& Mackay (2016), and Upton & Hathaway (2018). These studies
may reveal the eﬀective range of the diﬀusion approximation for
the magnetic ﬂux evolution at the solar surface.
