ABSTRACT 

Components of technical systems and devices often require self-lubricating properties, which are 

implemented  by  means  of  dry  lubricants.  However,  continuous  lubricant  coatings  on  the 

components’ surfaces often suffer from poor adhesion, delamination and crack propagation. The 

replacement of continuous coatings with dense ordered arrays of microparticles consisting of dry 

lubricants  may  overcome  these  drawbacks.  Using  the  well-established  solid  lubricant  MoS2  as 

model  system,  we  demonstrate  that  the  sliding  capability  of  polymeric  monoliths  can  be 

significantly enhanced by integration of arrays of micron-sized dry lubricant microparticles into 

their  contact  surfaces.  To  synthesize  the  MoS2  microparticle  arrays,  we  first  prepared  ordered 

hexagonal arrays of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATM) microparticles on Si wafers by molding 

against poly(dimethylsiloxane) templates followed by high-temperature conversion of the ATM 

microparticles  into  MoS2  microparticles  under  Ar/H2  atmosphere  in  the  presence  of  elemental 

sulfur. Finally, the obtained large-scale hexagonal MoS2 microparticle arrays were transferred to 

the surfaces of polymer  monoliths under conservation of the array ordering. Self-lubrication of 

components of technical systems by incorporation of dry lubricant microparticle arrays into their 

contact surfaces is an example for overcoming the drawbacks of continuous functional coatings 

by replacing them with microparticle arrays.

1. Introduction 

The  control  of  surficial  friction  of  displaceable  components  in  mechanical  systems  is  a 

ubiquitous technical problem apparent in microscale electromechanical building blocks as well as 

in large-scale technical systems. Self-lubricating hybrid and composite materials capable of sliding 

against counter-bodies in the absence of liquid lubricants have attracted significant interest [1, 2]. 

Commonly,  self-lubrication  is  achieved  with  dry  lubricants,  which  are  either  deposited  on  or 

incorporated  into  the  displaceable  components.  Self-lubricating  components  often  consist  of 

hybrid  materials  containing  dry  lubricants  within  their  entire  volumes.  Then,  the  material 

properties of the other components may deviate from the bulk material properties in an undesired 

way. Moreover, it might be challenging to concentrate sufficient amounts of the dry lubricants at 

the  sliding  surfaces.  Finally,  the  unnecessary presence  of  solid  lubricant  away  from  the  sliding 

surface  may  result  in  higher  material  costs.  It  is,  therefore,  desirable  to  locate  dry  lubricants 

exclusively at the sliding surfaces. However, film-like dry lubricant coatings prepared by methods 

such  as  physical  and  chemical  vapor  deposition  may  suffer  from  poor  adhesion  to  their 

substrates.[3-5] Hence, buckling, wrinkling, delamination and crack propagation may occur. These 

drawbacks may be circumvented by incorporating solid lubricants in a particulate form selectively 

into the sliding surface.  To ensure uniform friction properties, the lubricant particles should be 

uniform in size and evenly distributed across the sliding surface. 

One of the most important dry lubricants is molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) [6-8], a chemically 

inert transition metal dichalcogenide that has also been employed in catalysis [9-11], electronics 

[12, 13], photonics and optoelectronics [14, 15], bio-imaging and biosensing [16, 17], as well as 

in medical applications [16, 18]. MoS2 consists of stacks of two-dimensional MoS2 layers held 

together by van der Waals interactions. Because of easy interlayer sliding, MoS2 possesses low 

friction coefficients as well as low shear strengths. As a lubricant, MoS2 is vacuum-resistant and 

chemically  stable  at  least  up  to  350  °C  in  oxidizing  environments  [19].  It  would,  therefore, be 

highly attractive to incorporate dense and regular arrays of MoS2 particles into the sliding surfaces 

of bulk parts and components. Synthetic methods for the preparation of MoS2 nanoparticles have 

been summarized in recent reviews [20-24], some of which put special emphasis on the use of 

MoS2 nanoparticles as lubricant additives [25, 26]. Few activities have been directed to the rational 

positioning of MoS2 nanostructures and microstructures, which are often two-dimensional rather 

than  three-dimensional,  onto  substrates.  Thin  elemental  Mo  layers  patterned  via  top-down 

3 

 
lithography were converted to MoS2 by heat treatment in the presence of H2S [27]. Arrays of 2D 

MoS2 flakes were prepared by lithographic patterning combined with dry etching of MoS2 sheets 

[28] or of chemical conversion of MoS2 precursors [29].

with arrays of embedded MoS2 microparticles (PMMA_MoS2 monoliths). a) A solution of ATM in DMF 

(red) is deposited onto a hydrophilized macroporous PDMS mold (light blue), which is then b) covered by 

a hydrophilized SiO2-covered Si waver piece (blue). c) After evaporation of the DMF and detachment of 

the hydrophilized macroporous PMDS mold, a regular array of ATM microparticles (red) remains on the 

surface of the SiO2-covered Si wafer piece. d) Thermal sulfurization converts the ATM microparticles into 

MoS2  microparticles  (gray),  whereby  the  array  ordering  is  conserved.  e)  The  MoS2  microparticles  are 

covered  with  PMMA  by  spin-coating  a  PMMA/chloroform  solution  (white-transparent)  onto  the  MoS2 

microparticle  array.  f)  After  detachment  from  the  hydrophilized  SiO2-covered  Si  waver  piece,  a 

PMMA_MoS2 monolith is obtained. 

Here, we report the incorporation of dense, regular MoS2 microparticle arrays into the surfaces 

of polymer monoliths to optimize their sliding properties (Fig. 1). We first prepared monodomains 

of  ammonium  tetrathiomolybdate  (ATM)  microparticles  on  Si  wafers.  Then  we  converted  the 

ATM microparticles into crystalline MoS2 microparticles under conservation of the array order by 

4 

 
 
 
 
adapting  a previously  reported  high-temperature  reaction  of  ATM  in  the  presence  of  elemental 

sulfur [30]. The ordered MoS2 microparticle arrays obtained in this way were embedded onto the 

surface  of  poly(methyl  methacrylate)  (PMMA)  monoliths  (thereafter  referred  to  PMMA_MoS2 

monoliths). Thus, under a preset contact pressure of 3858 Pa the friction coefficient was halved as 

compared to unmodified PMMA monoliths. 

2. Materials and Methods 

2.1. Materials 

Macroporous silicon [31, 32] with conical macropores having hemispherical macropore bottoms 

(base diameter: 960 nm; bottom diameter: 650 nm; macropore depth: 1.0 µm; interpore distance: 

1.5 µm; cf. Fig. S1) was purchased from SmartMembranes (Halle, Saale). (100)-oriented p-type 

silicon wafers (1-30 Ωcm) coated with 300 nm thick dry SiO2 layers were purchased from Siegert 

Wafer GmbH (Aachen, Germany). ATM ((NH4)2MoS4; 99.97 %), polystyrene (PS; Mn = 267.000 

g/mol;  Mw  =  253.000  g/mol;  Mw/Mn  =  1.05),  KOH 

(85.5  %),  1H,1H,2H,2H-

perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane  (PFDTS;  97  %),  sulfur  (99.98  %),  chloroform  (99  %),  and  N,N-

dimethylformamide  (DMF,  99.8  %)  were  purchased  from  Sigma-Aldrich.  PMMA  (Mw  = 

1.820.000  g/mol;  Mn  =  1.580.000  g/mol;  Mw/Mn  =  1.15)  was  supplied  by  Polymer  Standards 

Service (Mainz, Germany). 

2.2. Fabrication of macroporous PDMS molds  

Macroporous silicon pieces with an area of 2 × 2 cm2 were cleaned by immersion into piranha 

solution  (98  %  H2SO4  and  30  %  H2O2  at  a  volume  ratio  of  3:1)  at  80  °C  for  30  min  and  then 

copiously rinsed with deionized water. The surface of the macroporous silicon was modified with 

PFDTS by vapor deposition in a sealed container at 85°C for 2 h and subsequently at 130 °C for 3 

h.  Then,  80  μL  of  a  5  wt-%  solution  of  PS  in  chloroform  was  poured  onto  PFDTS-modified 

macroporous silicon. The chloroform was allowed to evaporate overnight. The obtained negative 

PS replicas (Fig. S2) of the macroporous silicon were nondestructively detached and then covered 

with a precursor mixture for elastomeric PDMS (SYLGARD 184 formulation obtained from Dow 

Corning, USA; base and curing agent were mixed at a weight ratio of 10:1). After aging under 

ambient conditions for two days and nondestructive detachment, we obtained macroporous PDMS 

5 

 
 
molds  with  hexagonal  arrays  of  hemispherical  macropores  that  were  positive  replicas  of  the 

macroporous silicon (Fig. S3). 

2.3. Preparation of ATM microparticle arrays 

SiO2-covered Si substrates extending 2 × 2 cm2 were sonicated in acetone, ethanol as well as 

deionized  water  for  10  min  and  dried  in  a  nitrogen  flow.  The  Si  substrates  and  as  well  as  the 

macroporous PDMS molds were hydrophilized by oxygen plasma treatment at 100 W for 4 min 

using a Diener femto plasma cleaner. Then, 1 μL of a 6.2 mM (NH4)2MoS4 solution in DMF was 

deposited  onto  hydrophilized  macroporous  PDMS  molds  and  covered  with  SiO2-covered  Si 

substrates  treated  as  described  above.  After  drying  for  1  h  under  ambient  conditions,  the 

hydrophilized  macroporous  PDMS  molds  were  manually  detached  and  cleaned  for  reuse  by 

sonification in DMF, ethanol and water. 

2.4. Synthesis of MoS2 microparticle arrays 

SiO2-covered Si substrates patterned with ATM microparticle arrays were placed in the central 

heating zone of a tube furnace in the presence of 1.5 g elemental sulfur at the upstream end. The 

furnace was heated to 700 ℃ at a rate of 30 K min−1 under flow of a mixture of argon (100 s.c.c.m) 

and hydrogen (25 s.c.c.m). Under the same conditions, the samples were annealed at 700 ℃ for 

60 min and then cooled to room temperature at the natural cooling rate of the tube furnace. 

2.5. Surface functionalization of PMMA monoliths with MoS2 microparticle arrays 

We spin-coated 20 μL of a 5 wt% PMMA solution in chloroform onto the MoS2 microparticle 

arrays located on SiO2-covered Si substrates at 500 rpm for 5 s and then at 3000 rpm for 10 s. 

Subsequently, the samples were placed in an oven preheated to 180 ℃ and kept at this temperature 

for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, the SiO2 layers were etched in aqueous 30 wt-% 

KOH solution for 20 min. The PMMA_MoS2 monoliths were floated on the solution surface and 

rinsed with deionized water for several times. As reference samples, pure PMMA monoliths were 

prepared following the same procedure using SiO2-coated Si pieces without MoS2 microparticle 

arrays. 

2.6. Measurements of friction coefficients of PMMA_MoS2 monoliths  

6 

 
Circular PMMA_MoS2 monoliths with a diameter of 1.8 cm and a thickness of 115 μm (Fig. 

S4) and pure PMMA monoliths with the same dimensions were investigated with an Advanced 

Rheometric Expansion System (ARES) manufactured by T.A. Instruments in the constant strain 

mode at 24 °C. The samples were glued onto the center of the lower disk (diameter: 2 cm) of a 

motor shaft using UHU 48720-Drying Super Glue-Supergel. The upper aluminum disk (diameter: 

2 cm) connected to the transducer shaft was slowly moved down until – after contact formation 

with the entire surface of the sample – preset normal forces were reached. Measurements were 

carried out at normal forces of 0.49 N, 0.98 N and 1.47 N corresponding to contact pressures of 

1929 Pa, 3858 Pa and 5787 Pa. The lower plate was rotated with an angular frequency of 2.5π rad 

s ̶  1.  The  torque  of  PMMA_MoS2  and  PMMA  monoliths  prepared  in  the  same  way  but  in  the 

absence of MoS2 microparticles was measured and recorded using the software Orchestrator. Each 

measurement with a duration of 17 s was repeated for seven times. 

2.7. Morphological and structural characterization  

For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) a Zeiss AURIGA microscope was used and operated 

at  an  accelerating  voltage  of  7  kV.  The  geometrical  descriptors  apparent  area,  aspect  ratio, 

roundness,  and  nearest  neighbor  distances  of  ATM  microparticles  (Fig.  2b)  and  MoS2 

microparticles  (Fig.  S5)  imaged  by  SEM  were  determined  with  the  software  ImageJ  using  the 

freehand  selection  tool.  The  SEM  Zeiss  AURIGA  was  equipped  with  an  INCA  350  energy‐

dispersive  X‐ray  (EDX)  spectroscopy  unit  (Oxford  Instruments).  Topographical  images  were 

acquired with an atomic force microscope (AFM) NT-MDT NTEGRA in the semi-contact mode 

using GOLDEN SILICON cantilevers (NSG01/Pt; NanoLaboratory) with a tip height of 14-16 μm, 

a  tip  curvature  radius  of  35  nm,  a  20-30  nm  thick  reflective  Pt  side  coating,  and  a  resonant 

frequency  of  87  kHz  -  230  kHz.  For  X-ray  powder  diffractometry  (PXRD)  measurements,  the 

MoS2 microparticles were scratched from the SiO2-covered Si substrates and collected as powder. 

The  PXRD  measurements  were  conducted  on  an  X’Pert  Pro  diffractometer  (PANalytical)  with 

Bragg−Brentano geometry using Cu Kα (λ= 1.5406 Å) radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) and a 2θ step 

size of 0.0334°. Raman microscopy of MoS2 microparticle arrays was carried out with a WITec 

alpha300  R  confocal  Raman  imaging  system  (30  cm  focal  length;  600  grooves  per  millimeter 

grating  spectrometer;  spot  diameter  ~  3  µm)  equipped  with  an  electron-multiplying  charge-

coupled device (EM-CCD; Andor Newton DU970N-BV-353) using the 532 nm line of a He–Ne 

7 

 
laser with a power of 1.64 mW and an integration time of 0.5 s. For mappings, Raman spectra with 

an integration time of 0.2 s were acquired. The Raman spectra were analyzed and processed with 

the software Project FIVE. The stitched image of a MoS2 microparticle array on a SiO2-covered 

Si wafer shown in Fig. S6 was taken with an objective of Zeiss EC Epiplan-Neofluar 100x/0.9 

using  the  built-in  ocular  video  camera  and  the  stitching  function  of  the  system.  The  stitching 

microscopy image (1000 μm × 1000 μm) composed of 361 individual high-resolution images was 

recorded by the software Project FIVE.

3. Results and discussion 

The  preparation  algorithm  for  PMMA_MoS2  monoliths  is  displayed  in  Fig.  1.  At  first, 

macroporous PDMS molds were prepared by two-step replication molding of macroporous silicon 

(Fig.  S1)  [31,  32]  and  hydrophilized  by  exposure  to  oxygen  plasma.  The  macroporous  PDMS 

molds were topographically patterned with hexagonal arrays of macropores having an interpore 

distance  of  1.5  µm.  The  macropores  have  diameters  of  ~800  nm,  depths  of  1.0  µm  and 

hemispherical pore bottoms (Fig. S2). We dropped 1 μL of a solution of ATM in DMF onto the 

hydrophilized  macroporous  PDMS  molds  (Fig.  1a).  Then,  we  covered  the  hydrophilized 

macroporous  PDMS  molds  with  hydrophilized  SiO2-covered  Si  wafer pieces  (Fig.  1b).  After  a 

wait time of 2 h, the DMF had completely evaporated and we gently detached the macroporous 

PDMS molds. As a result, we obtained SiO2-covered Si wafers patterned with regular arrays of 

ATM microparticles (Fig. 1c) extending several cm2 (for a large-area SEM image see Fig. 2a). As 

revealed by the analysis of 44 ATM microparticles in the SEM image displayed in Fig. 2b, the 

ATM microparticles had a mean apparent area of 0.36 µm2 ± 0.05 µm2. Their height, as revealed 

by AFM, amounted to ~160 nm.  

A previously reported route to MoS2 involves at first the conversion of ATM into MoS3 in the 

temperature range from  120°C to 360 °C followed by conversion of MoS3 to MoS2 in an inert 

atmosphere at temperatures above 800 °C [30, 33]. However, direct annealing of ATM in an inert 

gas atmosphere even at temperatures as high as 1000 °C does not yield high-quality MoS2, while 

in hydrogen atmosphere the conversion of ATM to MoS2 already takes place at ~ 425 °C following 

Eq. 1 [30]. 

(NH4)2MoS4 + H2 → 2NH3↑ + 2H2S↑ + MoS2 (Eq. 1) 

Here, we applied a conversion following Eq. 1 and annealed the ATM microparticle arrays in the 

presence of sulfur under Ar/H2 flow at 700 °C for 60 min (Fig. 1c, d). In this way, we obtained 

regular large-area arrays of MoS2 microparticles (Fig. 3a, S6). The nearest neighbor distances (Fig. 

S7g, h) amounted to 1.38 µm ± 0.05 µm for the ATM microparticle arrays, and to 1.34 µm ± 0.10 

µm for the MoS2 microparticle arrays.

To further evaluate the shape evolution during the conversion of ATM microparticles to MoS2 

microparticles, we analyzed the corresponding SEM images (ATM miocroparticles: Fig. 2b; MoS2 

microparticles: Fig. S5) and determined the geometric descriptors apparent area, aspect ratio and 

roundness (Fig. S7a-f). The mean apparent area was reduced from 0.36 µm2 ± 0.05 µm2 for the 

ATM microparticles to 0.29 µm2 ± 0.07 µm2 for the MoS2 microparticles. The aspect ratio is the 

ratio of width and height of an object. The mean aspect ratio increased from 1.20 ± 0.14 for the 

ATM  microparticles 

to  1.33  ±  0.28  for 

the  MoS2  microparticles.  The  roundness 

4×area/(π×major_axis2) describes how closely the contour of an object resembles that of a perfect 

circle  having  a  roundness  of  1.  The  mean  roundness  decreased  from  0.85  ±  0.09  for  the  ATM 

10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
microparticles to 0.78 ± 0.14 for the MoS2 microparticles. Notably, the standard deviations of the 

apparent  area,  aspect  ratio,  roundness,  and  nearest  neighbor  distances  increase  after  the  high-

temperature  treatment  that  converted  the  ATM  microparticles  to  MoS2  microparticles.  The 

decrease in the average apparent area and the mean roundness, as well as the increase in the aspect 

ratios indicate that shape reconstructions occurred so that the MoS2 microparticles  are stronger 

faceted than the ATM microparticles. This notion is corroborated by the detailed view of MoS2 

microparticles shown in Fig. 3b. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mappings revealed homogeneous 

distributions of Mo and S atoms within the prepared MoS2 microparticles (Fig. S8). The height of 

the  MoS2  microparticles  amounted  to  ~70  nm  (Fig.  3c,  d),  about  half  the  height  of  the  ATM 

microparticles. 

To characterize the crystal phase of the obtained MoS2 microparticles, X-ray powder diffraction 

(PXRD)  (Fig.  4a)  and  Raman  spectroscopy  (Fig.  4b)  were  employed.  The  PXRD  pattern  of  a 

powder  of  MoS2  microparticles  scraped  off  from  SiO2-covered  Si  substrates  shows  diffraction 

peaks at 2ϴ values of 14.2°, 32.7°, 39.6°, 44.1°, 49.4°, 58.5°, and 60.3°, which could be assigned 

to  the  (002),  (100),  (103),  (006),  (105),  (110),  and  (008)  reflections  of  hexagonal  MoS2  (space 

group P 63/mmc; JCPDF card 37-1492) in line with previous reports [34-36]. Raman spectra were 

measured with a confocal Raman imaging system; the diameter of the laser spot on the sample 

surface amounted to ~3 µm so that approximately 3 MoS2 microparticles were covered (Fig. 4b). 

The Raman spectra acquired in this way exhibited two pronounced peaks at 383.2 cm ̶ 1 and 407.5 

cm ̶ 1 representing the in-plane E1

2g and the out-of-plane A1g vibrational modes of MoS2 [37, 38]. 

The peak positions and the frequency difference of 24.3 cm ̶ 1 between the peaks indicate bulk-like 

properties which might be beneficial for the mechanical performance [39, 40]. A Raman mapping 

performed for the E1

2g mode of MoS2 at 383.2 cm ̶ 1 (Fig. 4c) confirmed the conversion of the ATM 

microparticles to MoS2 microparticles under conversation of the array ordering.

To transfer the MoS2 microparticle arrays to the contact surfaces of PMMA monoliths, we spin-

coated solutions of PMMA in chloroform onto MoS2 microparticle arrays located on SiO2-coated 

Si wafers. After the evaporation of the chloroform, a ~115 μm thick PMMA layer was obtained 

(Fig. S4). Partial etching of the SiO2 layer in aqueous KOH solution allowed the detachment of 

the  obtained  PMMA_MoS2  monoliths.  The  ordering  of  the  MoS2  microparticle  arrays  was 

conserved as revealed by SEM investigations on PMMA_MoS2 monoliths (Fig. 5); the ordering 

of  the  MoS2  microparticle  arrays  at  the  contact  surfaces  of  the  PMMA_MoS2  monoliths 

corresponded  to  that  of  the  MoS2  microparticle  arrays  on  the  SiO2-covered  Si  wafers.  The 

corresponding AFM image (Fig. 5c) shows that the MoS2 microparticles were partially embedded 

into the contact surface of the PMMA_MoS2 monoliths. The MoS2 microparticles protruded ~ 14

To evaluate the impact of the MoS2 microparticle arrays on the interfacial tribological properties 

of PMMA_MoS2 monoliths, we measured the torque of the PMMA_MoS2 contact surfaces and – 

as a reference – of the contact surfaces of a PMMA monolith. The latter was prepared in the same 

way than the MoS2_PMMA monoliths, but in the absence of MoS2 microparticles. The tribological 

measurements  were  carried  out  using  a  rotating-disk  configuration.  We  applied  various  normal 

forces resulting in contact pressures of 1929 Pa,  3858 Pa and 5787 Pa. The disk, on which the 

sample to be investigated had been mounted, was rotated at an angular frequency of 2.5π rad s ̶ 1. 

Each sample was subjected to seven successive measurements with a duration of 17 s to determine 

the  magnitude  τ  of  the  torque  τ,  from  which  the  friction  coefficients  µ  were  calculated.  In  the 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
rotating disk configuration used here, the contact area between the rotating samples and the fixed 

aluminum disk serving as counter surface has a radius L = 9 mm. Each annular ring segment of 

the  contact  area  with  a  width  dr  and  a  distance  r  from  the  center  (0  ≤  r  ≤  L)  contributes  a 

differential torque dτ(r) to τ, which depends on r. Hence, τ is obtained by integrating dτ(r) from r 

= 0 to r = L: 

(cid:8)
(cid:1) = (cid:3) d(cid:1)((cid:6))
(cid:9)

 (Eq. 2) 

The area of an annular ring segment amounts to 2πrdr. The mass m applied to the contact area 

represents the applied normal force and the applied contact pressure. The fraction dm(r) of m that 

can formally be designated to an annulus amounts to:  

 dm =

(cid:10)

(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:12)  2π(cid:6)d(cid:6) =

(cid:16)(cid:10)(cid:17)

(cid:8)(cid:12) d(cid:6) (Eq. 3) 

The fraction dffriction of the friction force ffriction that can be assigned to an annulus amounts to: 

ffriction = µ (d(cid:18))(cid:19) =

(cid:16)µ(cid:10)(cid:21)(cid:17)

(cid:8)(cid:12) d(cid:6) (Eq. 4), 

where (cid:19) is the acceleration of gravity. The differential torque dτ(r) equals: 

dτ(r) = r dffriction(r) =

(cid:16)µ(cid:10)(cid:21)(cid:17)(cid:12)
(cid:8)(cid:12)

d(cid:6) (Eq. 5). 

Combining Eq. 2 and Eq. 5 yields: 

                                         τ = (cid:3) d(cid:1)((cid:6))

(cid:8)

Thus, the friction coefficients µ can be calculated as:

 (Eq. 7) 

The  average  torque  τ  obtained  by  seven  successive  measurements  on  PMMA_MoS2  monoliths 

amounted to 0.57246 ± 0.071 * 10-3 Nm for a contact pressure of 1929 Pa, to 1.3406 ± 0.0758 * 

10-3 Nm for a contact pressure of 3858 Pa and to 1.53522 ± 0.0467 * 10-3 Nm for a contact pressure 

of  5787  Pa  (Fig.  6a  and  Supporting  Table  S1).  The  average  friction  coefficients  for  the 

MoS2_PMMA monoliths µMoS2_PMMA amounted to 0.19463 ± 0.0214 for a contact pressure of 1929 

Pa, to 0.17379 ± 0.00889 for a contact pressure of 3858 Pa and to 0.16887 ± 0.00514 for a contact 

pressure of 5787 Pa (Fig. 6b and Table S2). Derazkola and Simchi showed that PMMA containing 

5-20 vol% Al2O3 nanoparticles having an average diameter of 50 nm exhibits a friction coefficient 

of 0.2~0.5 [41]. Lin et al. reported a friction coefficient of ~0.25 for PMMA monoliths coated with 

bilayered films composed of diamond-like carbon and silicon [42]. Li reported a decrease in the 

friction coefficient from 0.59 for PMMA to 0.35 for PMMA containing 7 vol% TiO2 nanoparticles 

15 

 
[43].  Considering  these  benchmarks,  embedding  ordered  MoS2  microparticle  arrays  into  the 

surface of PMMA monoliths appears to be an effective method to alleviate interfacial friction.

down-triangles) prepared in the same way than the PMMA_MoS2 monoliths but in the absence of MoS2 

microparticles.  The  same  PMMA_MoS2  sample  was  successively  subjected  to  the  measurements  at 

pressures of 1929 Pa (black squares) and 5787 Pa (blue up-triangles). The measurement at 3858 Pa was 

carried out on a different PMMA_MoS2 sample (red circles). For each applied pressure seven successive 

measurements were carried out with an angular frequency of 2.5π rad s ̶ 1 and a duration of 17s.   

The  surface  topography  of  PMMA_MoS2  monoliths  after  the  seven  successive  torque 

measurements summarized in Fig. 6a was studied by SEM (Fig. 7a, for a large-scale image see 

16 

 
 
 
 
Fig. S9) and AFM (Fig. 7b and c). The large-scale ordering of the hexagonal MoS2 microparticle 

arrays was conserved. On the local scale, the MoS2 microparticles remained fixed at their initial 

positions. No indications of additional displacement or even detachment of MoS2 microparticles 

were  apparent  apart  from  defects  originating  from  preparation  steps  prior  to  the  torque 

measurements, as revealed by a comparison of corresponding SEM images (cf. Fig. 3a). The spike-

like  structures  seen  in  Figure  7a  are  a  signature  of  the  markedly  faceted  shape  of  the  MoS2 

microparticles (cf. Figures 3, 4c, 5b and Supporting Figure S5) rather than a result of the torque 

measurements. However, we assume that the initial contact formation with the aluminum disk used 

for the torque measurements resulted in additional flattening of the protruding parts of the MoS2 

microparticles. The initial contact is formed at asperities, resulting in small actual contact areas, 

high compressive stress and, therefore, likely in local plastic deformation. This assumption is in 

line with observations reported by Tedstone et al. [44], who exerted normal compressive load on 

MoS2 specimens with dimensions similar to those of the MoS2 microparticles studied by us.  

It is reasonable to assume that the torque measurements summarized in Fig. 6 were carried out in 

the  boundary  lubrication  regime,  where  load  is  primarily  supported  by  contacting  protruding 

asperities. On the macroscopic scale, the MoS2 microparticles at the surfaces of the PMMA_MoS2 

monoliths had no preferential crystal orientation with respect to the directions of normal load or 

of friction. However, already Martin et al. reported friction-induced orientation of the MoS2 basal 

planes  parallel  to  the  sliding  direction  [45]. Tedstone  et  al.,  whose  MoS2  specimens  were  also 

characterized by the absence of preferential crystal orientations with respect to external reference 

directions, assumed that application of compressive forces aligns the basal crystallographic planes 

of  MoS2  with  the  substrate  [44].  AFM  images  of  unoriented  MoS2  surfaces  are  typically 

characterized by isotropic grain structures [45]. However, the AFM images we obtained from our 

samples  after  the  torque  measurements  (cf.  Figure  7b)  show  signs  of  orientation,  which  can 

possibly  be  interpreted  as  the  result  of  the  impact  of  shear. Therefore,  we  speculate  that  load-

induced  and  shear-induced  orientation  of  the  MoS2  basal  planes  possibly  contributed  to  the 

observed  experimental  outcome.  The  moderate  decrease  in  the  torque  values  measured  on 

PMMA_MoS2  monoliths  with  increasing  contact  pressure  could  be  an  indication  for  more 

pronounced orientation of the MoS2 basal planes parallel to the monolith surface.  

The average torque measured for a PMMA monolith used as reference sample at a contact pressure 

of 3858 Pa amounted to 2.79173 ± 0.2039 * 10-3 Nm, and the corresponding friction coefficient to 

17 

 
0.35946  ±  0.01992.  Both  values  are  twice  as  high  as  the  values  obtained  on  a  PMMA_MoS2 

monolith tested under the same contact pressure. A direct systematic comparison of the friction 

properties  of  both  samples  is  not  possible  because  the  real  contact  areas  are  likely  different. 

However,  from  a  pragmatic  application-related  point  of  view,  the  incorporation  of  the  MoS2 

microparticle arrays into the surfaces of the PMMA_MoS2 monoliths results in an enhanced sliding 

capability.  It should be noted that torque and friction coefficient of the tested PMMA monolith 

decreased in the course of successive measurements. This outcome is possibly related to shear-

induced  cleavage  of  PMMA  chains  at  the  surface  of  the  PMMA  monolith.  If  so,  the 

functionalization of the surfaces of PMMA monoliths with MoS2 microparticles would not only 

increase  the  sliding  capability  but  would  also  protect  the  monolith  itself  from  shear-induced 

damage.

4. Conclusions 

Parts  and  components  of  devices  and  other  types  of  technical  systems  often  need  to be  self-

lubricating.  Therefore,  the  tribological  properties  of  their  contact  surfaces  need  to  be  tailored, 

typically  by  means  of  dry  lubricants.  Continuous  layers  of  dry  lubricants  often  suffer  from 

insufficient adhesion between dry lubricant and substrate, delamination and crack propagation. We 

have evaluated whether these drawbacks can be overcome by replacing continuous coatings with 

dense  ordered  arrays  of  dry  lubricant  microparticles  embedded  into  the  substrate  surface.  It  is 

obvious that delamination and crack propagation are intrinsically impossible if substrate surfaces 

are modified with microparticle arrays. Moreover, the partial embedding of the microparticles into 

the substrate surfaces way may enhance adhesion between dry lubricant and the underlying bulk 

substrate. We selected the widely used dry lubricant MoS2 as model system. A PDMS mold with 

macropore arrays fabricated by double replication of macroporous silicon templates was employed 

to  prepare  monodomains  of  ATM  microparticles  on  SiO2-coated  Si  wafers.  Subsequent  high-

temperature conversion under Ar/H2 flow in the presence of elemental sulfur yielded large-area 

hexagonal arrays of MoS2 microparticles with diameters of ~800 nm and heights of ~70 nm. The 

MoS2  microparticle  arrays  were  transferred  to  the  surfaces  of  PMMA  monoliths  under 

conservation  of  the  array  ordering.  Tribological  tests  revealed  that  the  presence  of  the  MoS2 

19 

 
 
 
 
microparticle arrays at the surfaces of PMMA monoliths halves the friction coefficient. The results 

reported  here  indicate  that  tailoring  of  the  tribological  properties  of  parts  and  components 

consisting  of  polymers  and  other  moldable  materials  can  be  achieved  by  embedding  arrays  of 

microparticles  into  their  surfaces,  thus  circumventing  the  problems  with  continuous  coatings 

mentioned above.
