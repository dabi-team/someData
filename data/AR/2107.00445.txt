Abstract 

In this article a new, multi-functional, high-vacuum astrophysical ice setup, VIZSLA (Versatile 

Ice Zigzag Sublimation Setup for Laboratory Astrochemistry), is introduced. The instrument 

allows the investigation of astrophysical processes both in a low-temperature para-H2 matrix 

and  in  astrophysical  analog  ices.  In  para-H2  matrix  the  reaction  of  astrochemical  molecules 

with H atoms and H+ ions can be studied very effectively. For the investigation of astrophysical 

analog ices the setup is equipped with different irradiation and particle sources: an electron gun, 

for modeling cosmic rays; an H atom beam source (HABS); a microwave H atom lamp, for 

generating H Lyman-a radiation, and a tunable (213 nm to 2800 nm) laser source. For analysis, 

an FT-IR (and a UV-Visible) spectrometer and a quadrupole mass analyzer are available. The 

setup has two cryostats, offering novel features for analysis. Upon the so-called temperature-

programmed desorption (TPD) the molecules, desorbing from the first cryostat, can be mixed 

with  Ar  and  can  be  deposited  onto  the  substrate  of  the  other  cryostat.  The  well-resolved 

spectrum of the molecules isolated in an Ar matrix serves a unique opportunity to identify the 

desorbing products of a processed ice. Some examples are provided to show how the para-H2 

matrix  experiments  and  the  TPD  –  matrix-isolation  recondensation  experiments  can  help  to 

understand  astrophysically  important  chemical  processes  at  a  low  temperature.  It  is  also 

discussed,  how  these  experiments  can  complement  the  studies  carried  out  by  similar 

astrophysical ice setups. 

 
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION  

It  was  believed  in  the  early  20th  century  that,  due  to  radiations,  chemical  species  such  as 

molecules or radicals cannot exist in the interstellar medium (ISM). The first prediction for the 

presence of a diatomic species, CH, in the ISM was made in the late 1930s.1 This radical was 

identified  in  the  ISM  only  3  years  later  based  on  the  comparison  of  spectra  recorded  in  the 

laboratory  and  measured  by 

telescopes.2  Since 

the 

start  of  Atacama  Large 

Millimeter/submillimeter  Array  (ALMA)  observations  in  2011,  the  number  of  identified 

chemical species in the ISM has largely increased, nowadays, not counting isotopomers, about 

250  molecular  species  have  been  unambiguously  identified.3,4  It  can  be  expected that  future 

missions,  e.g., the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  (JWST),5  will  also  have  a  large  impact  on 

observational astrochemistry and will further increase the diversity of identified astrochemical 

species. 

The solid identification of the chemical species in the ISM can only be based on the comparison 

of laboratory experiments and telescopic observations. Furthermore, the understanding of the 

formation  and  destruction  of  molecules  in  different  celestial  objects  also  requires  laboratory 

investigations.  Since  most  of  the  astrophysical  environments  are  extreme  compared  to 

terrestrial  conditions,  it  is  challenging  to  model  these  conditions  in  the  laboratory,  and  it 

requires  special  setups  dedicated  to  laboratory  astrochemistry  experiments.  The  chemistry 

undergoing  in  these  conditions  can  also  be  fundamentally  different  from  that  learned  in  a 

standard organic or inorganic laboratory. 

The  early  laboratory  astrochemistry  focused  mostly  on  gas-phase  studies.  Now  it  is  well 

accepted that for understanding the composition of the gaseous ISM, it is inevitable to study 

solid-state  astrochemical  processes.6  Both  theoretical  modeling  and  laboratory  experiments 

proved that there are a number of important and abundant interstellar species, which can only 

form  on  the  icy  surface  of  interstellar  grains,  and  are  released  into  the  gaseous  ISM  by 

desorption. Among these species, the most important is the hydrogen molecule (H2).7,8 

In  a  typical  solid-state  astrophysical  ice  experiment,  small  molecules  are  deposited  onto  a 

cryogenic  surface  in  an  ultrahigh  vacuum  (UHV,  1(cid:194)10(cid:3013)8 mbar  (cid:177)  10(cid:3013)11 mbar)  chamber.  The 

reactions are triggered either by different types of radiations, e.g., UV-Vis, Hydrogen Lyman-(cid:68)(cid:15) 

or X-rays, or by electron beam (mimicking the effect of cosmic rays), by ion bombardment or 

by  reactive  atoms,  including  e.g.  H,  C,  or  N  atoms.9,10  The  reaction  is  spectroscopically 

monitored in the solid-state and usually the species subliming upon a temperature-programmed 

1 

 
desorption  (TPD)  process  are  also  analyzed,  most  often  by  mass  spectrometry.  Far  from  a 

complete list, some of the most well-known special setups designed for these kinds of studies 

include the Keck Machine (at University of Hawaii, USA),11 CRYOPAD and SURFRESIDE3 

(at  University  of  Leiden,  Netherland),9,10  FORMOLISM  and  VENUS  (at  CY  Cergy  Paris 

University, France),12,13 ICA (at Institute of Nuclear Research, Debrecen, Hungary),14 SPACE 

CAT2  (at  Harvard  University),15  PAC  (at  Open  University),16  the  STARK  chamber  (at  the 

Universidade  do  Vale  do  Para(cid:116)ba),17  as  well  as  further  cryogenic  setups  at I3OLAB  (NASA 

AMES, USA),18 at the Osservatorio Astrofisico di Catania,19 at the Laboratory  Astrophysics 

Group at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena,20 and at the Astrophysical Chemistry / Ice & 

Planetary Science Group at Hokkaido University, Japan.21 

Generally,  the  deposited  and  the  processed  ices  are  investigated  in  the  solid  phase  by  IR, 

Raman,  and  UV-VIS  spectroscopic  methods,  while  a  quadrupole  mass  spectrometer  (QMS) 

with electron impact ionization is used for the analysis of the subliming molecules. The main 

difficulty of the solid-phase spectroscopic investigation of the ices is the spectral broadening, 

which is due to the strong intermolecular interactions. As a consequence of this, the IR, Raman, 

or  UV-VIS  spectra  are  usually  not  sufficient  for  unambiguous  identification  of  distinct 

molecules. Very often, only the functional groups present in the ice can be determined on the 

basis of characteristic vibrations; isomers possessing the same functional group or molecules 

of  a  homolog  series  are  indistinguishable.22  The  mass  distribution  of  the  ionized  desorbing 

gaseous molecules, recorded by a QMS, frequently does not provide adequate information to 

distinguish between isomers. Furthermore, due to fragmentation, the electron impact ionization 

is  usually  insufficient  to  identify  elusive,  weakly  bonded  molecules  that  might  be  abundant 

under certain conditions in space.22 

To overcome the spectral resolution problem upon the investigation of astrophysical ices, the 

astrochemical  species  can  be  studied  in  inert  (e.g.,  noble  gas)  matrices,  by  so-called  matrix 

isolation technique.23,24 This method, of course, has serious limitations, since the environment 

is very different from that in astrophysical ices. Nevertheless, spectral information and some 

limited astrochemically relevant processes, e.g., photodecomposition can be studied, at least as 

a first approximation by this method. Experiments using matrix isolation method, which aim to 

be the most useful for astrochemical studies, apply solid para-H2 as a host. The main advantage 

of  this  host  is  that  the  intermolecular  interactions  are  extremely  small;  therefore,  the  sharp 

spectral  lines  are  suitable  for  dependable  molecular  identification.  Further  advantage  of  this 

method  is  that  H  atoms  can  efficiently  be  generated  in  this  matrix,  and  the  H  atoms  rapidly 

2 

 
diffuse  in  there  by  quantum  tunneling.25(cid:177)29  This  provides  excellent  conditions  to  study  low-

temperature H atom addition and subtraction reactions, which are important processes in dark 

molecular clouds. The advantages and limitations of this method for astrochemical studies were 

discussed  recently.30  In  addition,  H+  (in  the  form  of  astrochemically  important  H3

+  and  Hn

+ 

species)  can  also  be  effectively  produced  in  solid  para-H2,  providing  a  possibility  to  study 

protonation reactions and protonated astrophysical species.31 

It is very challenging to complement the usual mass analysis of the desorbing species upon the 

TPD process with a spectroscopic method, because the concentration of these species in the gas 

phase  is  very  low,  and  the  spectra  can  be  accumulated  for  a  short  period  of  time  at  a  given 

desorption temperature. Due to this difficulty, conventional low-signal-to-noise and slow gas-

phase spectroscopic methods cannot be applied for this purpose, and there is a limited number 

of astrophysical ice setups for which special designs are used to overcome this problem. Among 

these, Theul(cid:112) et al. showed b(cid:92) a proof-of-principle study that high-resolution microwave spectra 

of the desorbing species can be obtained by a chirped-pulse Fourier-transform spectrometer if 

the  gas  pressure  reaches  ca.  6(cid:194)10(cid:3013)6  mbar.32  A  similar  submillimeter/far-IR  setup  (SubLIME) 

was constructed by Weaver and coworkers.33 Kaiser and coworkers demonstrated in a number 

of  studies  that  photoionization  (PI)  reflectron time-of-fight  mass  spectrometry  (ReTOF-MS) 

can  be  effectively  coupled  with  an  astrophysical  ice  setup  to  analyze  the  species  desorbing 

during  the  TPD  process.11  On  their  Keck  machine  the  intense  monochromatic  radiation  is 

produced by third-harmonic generation or four-wave mixing of laser beams (ESI of ref. 34). The 

main  advantage  of  this  setup  is  that  the  ionization  potentials  belonging  to  different  mass 

channels  can  be  determined  by  repeating  the  experiments  using  different  photon  energies. 

Comparison  of  the  measured  ionization  potentials  to  literature  data  or  quantum-chemical 

computations makes it possible to differentiate between different isomers. A further advantage 

of the PI-ReTOF-MS compared to the electron-impact QMS gas analyzer is that fragmentation 

can be considerably reduced by tuning the photon energy just above the ionization energy.22 

In  this  paper  we  describe  the  construction,  and  demonstrate  the  strengths  of  a  new  setup: 

VIZSLA35  [(cid:1942)vi(cid:1892)l(cid:1829)],  (Versatile  Ice  Zigzag  Sublimation  setup  for  Laboratory  Astrochemistry) 

that is primarily constructed to provide IR spectroscopic information on the desorbing species 

from the surface of astrophysical ices upon the TPD process. The setup comprises two cryostats. 

The ice is deposited onto and processed on a substrate mounted on the first cryostat. In a chosen 

temperature range of the TPD process, the desorbing molecules are mixed with an inert gas and 

deposited onto a substrate mounted on the second cryostat. Therefore, matrix-isolation IR (or 

3 

 
UV-Vis) spectra of the species accumulated this way can be recorded. The molecules desorbing 

either from the first or the second cryostat  can also be analyzed by a traditional way, using a 

QMS. VIZSLA is equipped with a laser OPO photon source (213(cid:3013)2800 nm), an H-atom lamp 

(Lyman-(cid:68), 121.6 nm), an electron gun, and an H atom beam source to trigger reactions. It also 

consists of a normal-H2 to para-H2 converter, providing the possibility for investigation of H 

atom reactions in solid para-H2. 

II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 

The instrument has been designed to fulfill the requirements for both solid-phase astrochemical 

ice experiments, and para-H2 matrix isolation studies with the extra capability of sublimation 

and recondensation of the sample between two cold heads. (This process is referred to by the 

phrase of (cid:181)Zig-(cid:93)ag Sublimation(cid:182) in the name of the setup.) In order to record relevant data on 

astrochemical  ices,  one  needs  UHV  conditions,  while  for  para-H2  studies  it  is  inevitable  to 

reach  temperatures  below  3.5(cid:3013)3.8 K.  To  achieve  an  effective  sublimation-recondensation 

process, the cold heads need to be close to each other. Furthermore, to avoid contamination of 

the secondary cryostat used for the recondensation, it has to be separated from the other, primary 

cryostat  for  the  time  when  the  ice  is  being  deposited  and  processed  on  the  substrate  of  the 

primary cryostat.  

A. The UHV chamber 

The main component of the system is a cylindrical UHV chamber that has one coaxial interface 

port on the bottom, and one on the top  lid to accept two independent cryostat units (Fig. 1). 

There are 14 ports on the side of the chamber in the same plane. One large port (DN160CF) is 

dedicated to the turbomolecular pump (Leybold TURBOVAC MAG W 600 iP) whereas three 

medium-sized ones (DN100CF) for the sample inlet on the front and for the two viewports on 

the sides. Furthermore, there are six smaller (DN40CF)  flanges on the  front and  four on the 

backside of the chamber forming three plus two symmetric pairs, respectively. Those are used 

to connect different manipulation tools, irradiation sources, and various analytical tools to the 

chamber. Since the flanges are identical, there is a lot of freedom in the configuration of the 

available tools so the chamber can be adapted to the requirements of the specific experiments 

to increase the versatility of the system. The lid of the chamber has a differentially pumped seal, 

4 

 
 
 
and it can be lifted up to give access to the inside components. Hence, everyday maintenance, 

e.g.,  cleaning,  does  not  require  time-consuming  disassembly  of  the  system.  The  chamber  is 

supported  by  a  metal  frame  and  surrounded  by  an  optical  table  to  give  a  solid  base  for  the 

necessary optical arrangements around the chamber.

lamp:  microwave  discharge  H-atom  lamp  (H  Lyman-(cid:68)  source);  MS:  quadruple  mass 
spectrometer. Except for FTIR IN and OUT and UV-VIS IN and OUT, the other components 
can  easily  be  exchanged  on the  ports  according  to the  requirements of  the  experiment. (The 
attachment of the UV-Visible spectrometer to the systems is still under construction.) 

5 

 
 
 
 
When the 10-kelvin cryostat is in its upper position (see below), it can be separated from the 

main  chamber by  a  gate valve. An auxiliary  turbomolecular pump (Edwards Next85H CF63 

NW16 80W) maintains the vacuum in the separated section while the gate valve is closed (Fig. 

1). 

The  two  turbomolecular  pumps  of  the  UHV  chamber  share  the  same  fore  vacuum  system 

consisting of a roots pump (Leybold RUVAC WAU 251) built together with a two-stage rotary 

vane pump (Leybold TRIVAC D 40 B).  

The pressure  in the chamber  is  monitored by  convection (Lesker KJLC 275 series) and EB-

degas  Bayard-Alpert  Iridium  Hot  Cathode  (Lesker  G8130)  ionization  gauges.  The  chamber, 

excluding  heat-sensitive  parts,  can  be  baked  up  to  80(cid:131)C.  The  baking  system  of  the  UHV 

chamber is divided into 12 sections. Each section is equipped with a K-type thermocouple and 

an  Autonics  TX4S-B1R  temperature  controller.  In  addition,  to  prevent  overheating  of  the 

cryostats, the temperature of the flanges connecting the cryostats and the UHV chamber and 

the temperature of cryostat heads are monitored during the baking. The heating elements  are 

made of silicone isolated heating cables. For remote control purposes, the Autonics TX4S-B1R 

temperature controllers are connected via an RS485 local network and an Autonics SCM-WF48 

communication converter to a PC running the DAQMaster program. After baking, the system 

can be evacuated to the 10(cid:3013)9 mbar region at room temperature.  

B. 4-kelvin cryostat unit 

The 4-kelvin cryostat unit (Sumitomo RDK-415D) is attached to the bottom of the chamber 

through a differentially pumped rotary platform and bellows. This allows the cryostat head to 

be translated vertically and rotated around the vertical axis b(cid:92) 360(cid:131). One of the end positions 

of  the  translation  belongs  to  the  sample  substrate  being  in  the  center  of  the  chamber.  The 

cryostat is completely out of the middle section of the chamber at the other end position. An 

offset head made of OFHC copper is bolted to the second stage of the cryostat equipped with a 

heater,  and  a  Si  diode  thermometer.  Indium  gaskets  were  used  between  mating  surfaces  to 

ensure  good  heat  conductivity.  An  aluminum  radiation  shield  bolted to the  first  stage of  the 

cryostat achieves thermal  isolation. The  lowest available temperature is 3.1 K, which can  be 

reached within a dynamic 1.5 h cool down time.  

6 

 
 
 
C. 10-kelvin cryostat unit 

The 10-kelvin cryostat unit (Sumitomo CH202) is attached to the top of the chamber through a 

gate  valve  and  bellows,  allowing  the  cryogenic  head  to  be  translated  vertically.  At  one  end 

position of the vertical travel, the sample substrate is in the center of the chamber, at the other 

end position the cryostat is fully retracted into the bellows section permitting the gate valve to 

be closed for complete separation of the 10-kelvin system from the main chamber. The structure 

of the head attached to the second stage, and the radiation shield attached to the first stage are 

similar  to those of  the  4-kelvin  unit  except  the  10-kelvin  head  is  slightly  smaller,  and  has  a 

para-H2  converter  attached  to the  cold  head  as  well.  This  double  use  of  the  second  cryostat 

made  the  system  more  compact  and  economical  to  build.  The  converter  was  inspired  by  an 

earlier design but slight modifications were required for adaptation to UHV conditions.36 The 

Fe2O3 catalyst-filled 1/8" OD OFHC copper tube was coiled around an OFHC copper block 

previously wrapped in an indium foil. The coil was tightened by aluminum clamps. The catalyst 

block has a thermocouple, as well as a heating element built into it, and it can be dismantled 

from  the  cold  section  in  order  to  allow  thermal  activation  of  the  catalyst.  Stainless  steel 

capillaries  carry  the  normal-H2  gas  into  and  the  para-H2  gas  out  of  the  converter  through 

all-metal  valves.  Despite  this  small  cold  head  is  heavily  overloaded,  it  can  still  reach 

temperatures below 12 K, but with the drawback of a long (~9 h) cooldown time. This turned 

out not to be a serious constraint if it is taken into consideration upon planning the experiments. 

D. Sample heads 

A 10 mm (cid:238) 10 mm polished reflective (presently gold) coated silver substrate is mounted on 

both  the  4-kelvin  and  the  10-kelvin  sample  heads  (Fig.  2).  Indium  gaskets  were  used  to 

minimize  the  temperature  difference  between  the  substrate  and  the  OFHC  Cu  block. 

Horizontally  the  full  10 mm  size  of  the  substrate  is  available,  vertically  only  8 mm  can  be 

exposed. The temperatures of the cold heads are monitored and controlled by a Lakeshore 365D 

temperature  controller.  There  is  one  extra  mounting  point  on  both  heads,  those  can  be  used 

either  for  mounting  an  alignment  target  or  a  standard  Quartz  Crystal  Microbalance  (QCM). 

Currently, the 4-kelvin cold head is equipped with a fluorescent ZnS target (Specs). There are 

cutout windows on the radiation shield in order to give access to the sample and the target (or 

QCM) surfaces.

cryostat  head.  A:  radiation  shield;  B:  gold-coated  silver  substrate;  C:  fluorescence  plate 
(electron irradiation  alignment target); D: dual-capillary gas  inlet; E: quadruple-capillary gas 
inlet. 

The offset construction and the rotation of the 4-kelvin cryostat allow both heads to be present 

in the center of the chamber facing each other at the same time making possible the sublimation 

of  the  sample  from  one  of  the  substrates  and  the  recondensation  on  the  other  one.  Minimal 

distance (~30 mm) had been chosen between the sample heads that still gives enough gap for 

the  FT-IR  beam  to  pass  through  without  clipping,  while  the  heads  face  each  other.  This 

maximizes  the  efficiency  of  the  evaporation-recondensation  process,  while  still  enables  IR 

spectroscopic  measurements  on 

the  10-kelvin  cryostat  without 

interrupting 

the 

TPD/redeposition process or moving the 4-kelvin head out of the IR beam path. Some possible 

geometrical arrangements accessible by the rotation of the 4-kelvin head and the translation of 

both cryostat heads are shown in Fig. 3.

a TPD process of the sample on the substrate of the 4-kelvin head onto the substrate of the 10-
kelvin head with simultaneous FT-IR spectroscopic measurement. 

E. Sample inlets 

The system has a main sample inlet on the front side, equipped with a stainless steel Knudsen 

evaporation/decomposition  cell  rated  up to  350(cid:131)C,  and two  dual-capillary  gas  sample  inlets, 

allowing  simultaneous  deposition  of  one  non-volatile  sample,  and  two  gas-phase  mixtures 

(Fig. 1.). Flow rates are regulated by leak valves (Lesker Ultra-fine, VZLVM940R). The gas 

jets only meet at the front of the cold surface, so one can also deposit such kinds of gases that 

would otherwise react with each other. The sample inlet connects to the system through bellows, 

so it can be positioned closer or farther away from the substrate, and can also be retracted to 

clear the center of the chamber to make space for the rotation of the 4-kelvin cryostat head.  

Besides the main sample inlet used for initial deposition, the 4-kelvin cryostat unit also has two 

independent  secondary  gas  inlet  capillary  systems  supported  by  room-temperature  stands 

around the cold head (Fig. 2). A dual-capillary inlet gets through holes drilled on the cold head 

without touching the cold surfaces, and a quadruple-capillary inlet located completely outside 

the radiation shield surrounds the sample. For sublimation-recondensation experiments, the gas 

sample inlets, located on the 4-kelvin head, give the opportunity to co-deposit the molecules 

entered from the primary cryostat to the gas phase with argon (or another) gas by flooding the 

space  between the  heads  in order to form  a  matrix-isolated sample. These  inlets can also be 

used for introducing other reactive components. The 10-kelvin system has no gas sample inlet 

but  there  is  space  and  mounting  stand  for  one  quadruple-capillary  version  so  it  can  be 

implemented later if it is necessary. 

For  highly  corrosive  volatile  substances  not  compatible  with  stainless  steel  or  for  medium 

volatility compounds sublimating under high-vacuum conditions at room temperature an extra 

PTFE tube inlet is also available, and it can be mounted on one of the DN40CF flanges. (The 

construction and building materials of that inlet compromises the vacuum level. Due to its fixed 

9 

 
 
position, depending on its configuration this inlet might also interfere with the rotation of the 

4-kelvin  cryostat.  Because  of  these  reasons,  if  it  is  not  mandatory  for  an  experiment,  the 

application of this unit should be avoided.) Future plans include designing a pyrolysis source 

that could substitute the Knudsen cell if needed. For samples with medium volatility, a cooling 

system for the Knudsen cell inlet is also under construction. 

F. Gas manipulating system of VIZSLA 

Gas and volatile samples, and the para-H2 are manipulated with a metal gas mixing vacuum-

line equipped with valves, glass bulbs, metal cylinders, and various (piezo, Pirani, capacitance, 

and Penning) pressure gauges (Fig. 4). The vacuum-line can  be evacuated to a high-vacuum 

level (in the range of 10(cid:177)7 mbar) and baked to help the desorption of the contaminants from the 

walls. Its 2 baking sections are part of the baking system described in section II.A. 

FIG. 4. The gas manipulating system of VIZSLA.  

10 

 
 
 
 
The  vacuum  line  for  sample  manipulation  has  its  own  vacuum  system  consisting  of  a 

turbomolecular  pump  (Edwards  Next85H  NW40  NW16  80W)  and  a  rotary  vane  pump.  For 

evacuating  corrosive  and  hazardous  gases  an  alternative  rotary  vane  pump  equipped  with  a 

liquid N2 cooled trap is used to protect the high-vacuum system and the operators.  

G. Irradiation and particle sources 

Various  light  and  particle  sources  are  available  for  the  experiments.  The  sample  can  be 

irradiated  through  a  quartz  window  with  a  tunable  optical  parametric  oscillator  laser  source 

(OPO, GWU versaScan-ULD & GWU uvScan) pumped by the third harmonic of a nanosecond 

Nd:Yag laser (Spectra Physics LAB150-10). The laser system  is tunable  from the UV to the 

NIR (213(cid:177)2800 nm).  

For mimicking the interstellar H Lyman-(cid:68) radiation a microwave discharge H-atom lamp can 

be used. The discharge tube of the lamp is made of quartz, designed according to Ligterink et 

al., with two ports on the side (F-shaped) and can be mounted onto a differentially pumped LiF 

window  on  the  chamber.37  The  lamp  can  be  powered  by  an  EMS  Microtron  200  Mk3 

microwave generator (P = 100 W). H2 gas is entered into the quartz tube through the inlet closer 

to the window, while the other port of the lamp tube was connected to a rotary vane pump. The 

pressure is measured between the pump and the outlet of the lamp and for usual operation, it is 

set to 0.4 mbar. (It was shown by Ligterink et al. that for this applied geometry, this pressure is 

optimal  to  get  the  highest  intensity  of  the  astrophysically  important  H  Lyman-(cid:68)  radiation 

compared  to  the  broad-band  UV  background.)  Naturally,  any  standard  lamp  (like  Hg-Xe 

discharge lamp or LED sources) can be used as well.  

Available  particle  sources  include  a  commercial  electron  gun  (Specs  EQ  22)  and  a  thermal 

hydrogen atom beam source (MBE Komponenten HABS 40) equipped with a bent quartz tube 

to cool down the thermally generated H atoms. 

H. Analytical tools 

The most exterior DN40CF flanges on the front side of the chamber are equipped with ZnSe 

windows (Lesker, 2(cid:237)3/4"UHV VPZL-275UZ) and dedicated to the main analytical tool of the 

system, FT-IR spectroscopy. The beam of the spectrometer (Bruker Invenio-R) is reflected into 

11 

 
 
 
the chamber with mirror optics on the left side. The IR beam hits the surface of the film at about 

60(cid:131) angle of incidence (AOI), passes through the sample, then is reflected from the substrate, 

and  passes  through  the  film  again.  The  doubled  and  increased  beam  path  improves  the 

sensitivity of the system by a factor of 4 in the case of para-H2 matrix or at least by a factor of 

2 in the case of films with a high refractive index, compared to a normal incidence transmission 

geometry. The beam of the spectrometer leaves the UHV chamber on the opposite side and it 

is detected by a liquid N2 cooled external MCT detector (Bruker, mid-band) of the spectrometer. 

The  sample  on  either  the  4-kelvin  or the  10-kelvin  cryostat  can  be  measured  with  the  same 

spectrometer separately by moving one or the other cryostat into the beam path. The smallest 

possible distance was chosen between the sample heads that still gives barely enough gap for 

the  FTIR  beam  to  pass  through  when  the  heads  are  facing  each  other.  This  maximizes  the 

efficiency  of  the  sublimation-recondensation  process  while  it  still  enables  the  continuous 

monitoring  of  the  sample  on  the  secondary  cryostat  during  the  deposition.  Currently,  the 

spectral  cutoff  at  the  low-wavenumber  side  is  limited  by  the  ZnSe  windows  (600 cm(cid:177)1). 

Differentially pumped wedged KBr windows are under construction to increase the available 

spectral window. 

The  implementation  of  UV-VIS  spectroscopic  detection  (Ocean  Optics  HR2000)  is  under 

construction. Since for this application the DN40CF flanges on the backside of the chamber can 

be used, it will be available only for the 4-kelvin system, as its cryostat can be rotated into the 

required position. Alternatively, the Bruker Invenio-R FT-IR spectrometer can be upgraded in 

the  future  with  its  commercially  available  UV  extension,  which  could  provide  a  convenient 

UV-VIS spectroscopic study of the films or matrices deposited onto the substrate of either of 

the 4-kelvin or the 10-kelvin cryostats. 

The system will also be equipped with an optical film thickness monitoring system based on 

He-Ne laser interference. 

For the detection of species  in the gas phase, the chamber  is equipped with a QMS (Pfeiffer 

Prisma QMA 200). 

III. EXPERIMENTAL PERFORMANCE 

A.  Para-H2 conversion 

12 

 
 
Matrix isolation techniques have long been used in spectroscopy to assess species in a nearly 

interaction-free  environment.  In this  kind  of  experiments, the  sample  molecules  (guests)  are 

co-deposited with an inert gas called host (Ar, Ne, Kr, Xe, N2) in great excess onto a surface 

cooled  to  a  low  temperature,  usually  between  10(cid:177)30 K  depending  on  the  gas  used.24,38 

Consequently, the molecules are frozen into a solid matrix, isolated from each other by the host 

atoms/molecules.  The  technique  requires  a  high  vacuum  to  achieve  the  necessary  thermal 

isolation and to keep away  impurities  from the atmosphere. The gases  listed above are used 

most  frequently  but  more  exotic  matrix  materials  could  also  be  used;  for  instance  reactive 

compounds such as CO or para-H2, which latter has some unique properties making it a perfect 

candidate to perform matrix-isolation experiments. First, due to the extremely weak interaction 

with  the  guest  molecules,  the  bandwidth  of  the  IR  absorption  peaks  in  this  solid  quantum 

material  is  even  smaller  than  in  the  more  conventional  matrix  hosts  listed  above.  Secondly, 

since H atoms can effectively be generated in the matrix owing to the quantum diffusion effect 

that efficiently speeds up the H atom movement within the matrix,26(cid:177)29 H atom reactions can 

conveniently  be  followed  in  para-H2. It  should  be  noted,  however, that  it  has  its  limitations 

when it comes to the direct comparison with astrophysical ices or ice mixtures.30 

H2 has nuclear spin isomers, the ortho- and para-H2, with the latter being thermodynamically 

slightly more stable. Due to the near degenerate energy of the two forms, the ortho to para ratio 

is 3 : 1 at room temperature. Upon lowering the temperature, the ratio of the lower energy para 

form is increasing, but due to kinetic control, the equilibrium can be reached very slowly. The 

rate of the conversion process can be increased by a paramagnetic catalyst, which is Fe2O3 in 

our  case.  Before  entering  the  converter,  impurities  of  the  H2  gas  (>99.999%,  Messer)  were 

trapped  inside  a  copper  coil  cooled  by  a  liquid  N2  bath.  The  conversion  temperature  was 

selected to be 13.9 K, which was found to be the lowest for our converter, to achieve continuous 

flow (approximately 22 sccm  min(cid:3013)1) without condensation.  The freshly generated  para-H2 is 

collected in a glass bulb and can be used for the experiments thereafter, for instance for mixing 

with the sample  material or for directly  introducing  it to the  main chamber using one of the 

capillary arrays. To achieve better purity, the first 2(cid:238)~500 mbar(cid:194)L of para-H2 is thrown away. 

At  the  applied  13.9 K  conversion  temperature,  the  ortho  form  has  a  mixing  ratio  of 

approximately 50 ppm.25 Since impurities can catalyze the para to ortho back conversion, the 

ortho  impurity  has  to  be  checked  for  in  each  experiment.  The  relative  amount  of  ortho-H2 

impurity can be easily estimated based on the NIR spectrum taken from the deposited matrix. 

According to Tam and Fajardo, the absence of the Q1(0) + S0(1) transition belonging to ortho-

13 

 
H2  at  4740 cm(cid:177)1  indicates  an  ortho-H2  concentration  less  than  200 ppm,  whereas  the 

concentration  is  expected  to  be  around  20000 ppm  if  its  intensity  is  comparable  to  the 

neighboring  S1(0) + S0(0)  transition  of  para-H2.39  More  on  the  two  forms  of  H2  and  on  the 

nuclear spin conversion can be found in the comprehensive review written by Tsuge and Lee.25 

In order to demonstrate the purity of para-H2 obtained by our setup, Fig. 5 displays the NIR 

spectra of normal-H2 (3 : 1 ortho-H2 : para-H2) and para-H2 deposited onto the substrate of the 

4-kelvin  cryostat  at  3.1 K.  To  estimate  numerically  the  ortho-H2  impurity,  the  relative 

integrated absorptions of the  bands of the spin  isomers  were used. In the normal-H2 ice, the 

ortho-H2 band at 4740 cm(cid:177)1 has an integrated area of 1.722 cm(cid:177)1, whereas integrating that of 

the para form between 4520(cid:177)4495 cm(cid:177)1 yields 0.918 cm(cid:177)1, and a ratio of 1.88 for the two bands. 

The respective band areas in para-H2 were found to be 0.0018 cm(cid:177)1 and 5.855 cm(cid:177)1, giving a 

ratio  of  0.000307.  Taking  these  ratios,  and  keeping  in  mind  that  the  ortho-to-para  ratio  in 

normal-H2 is 3 : 1, an ortho-to-para ratio of 0.000490 (490 ppm) can be evaluated, which  is 

typical for our para-H2 matrix experiments.

B.  H atom generation and H atom reactions in solid para-H2 

The method of generating H atoms in a para-H2 matrix was originally established by the groups 

of Anderson and Lee during which numerous H addition, as well  as H abstraction reactions, 

have been described.28,29,40(cid:177)55 According to this procedure, the studied compound is deposited 

in a solid para-H2 matrix that contains Cl2 in a ratio of ca. 1 : 500(cid:177)1 : 2000. Cl atoms can be 

generated from Cl2 by photodecomposition, in the range of ca. 250(cid:177)400 nm. A wavelength for 

a  given  experiment  should  be  selected,  which  does  not  photolyze  the  molecule  under 

investigation. Practically we use our OPO system for this photolysis. In contrast to noble gas 

matrices, due to the diminished cage effect in solid para-H2, the Cl atoms do not recombine.25 

The forming Cl atoms can be monitored b(cid:92) checking for the spin(cid:237)orbit (SO) + Q1(0) transition 

at 5095 cm(cid:237)1 that is due to the simultaneous excitation of a Cl atom and a vibrational (v(cid:397) = 1, 

J(cid:397) = 0 (cid:312) v(cid:397)(cid:397) = 0, J(cid:397)(cid:397) = 0) transition of a para-H2 molecule (Fig. 6). Although para-H2 molecules 

do  not  react  with  Cl  atoms,  they  can  be  forced  to  do  so  by  exciting  the  Q1(1) + S0(0)  and 

Q1(0) + S0(0)  combination  vibration  of  para-H2  by  irradiating  the  matrix  with  either  with  a 

broad-band  NIR  source  (e.g.,  that  of  the  FT-IR  spectrometer)  or  2217 nm  laser  radiation 

(generated by our OPO system): 

Cl + H2 (cid:314) HCl + H 

The  broad-band  NIR  source  has  the  disadvantage,  that  in  our  case  it  has  lower  intensity, 

furthermore, it can induce the H atom abstraction or H atom addition reactions by vibrationally 

exiting the molecule in study. This usually unwanted IR induction can be avoided by using the 

2217 nm  laser  radiation,  however,  the  high  energy  pumped  into  the  matrix  can  increase  the 

diffusion rate of the H atoms and can increase the average kinetic energy of the H atoms. These 

effects should be studied in details in a further study. 

The  formation  of  H  atoms  upon  the  NIR  irradiation  can  be  monitored  by  measuring  the 

absorption peak of byproduct HCl molecules at 2895 cm(cid:237)1 in the MIR spectrum. FT-IR spectra 

in the MIR range can be recorded in real time without switching off the NIR irradiation source 

using a low-pass filter with a cutoff wavelength of 3960 cm(cid:237)1 in front of the detector (Fig. 6). 

There are alternative ways to produce H atoms, such as by the (193(cid:3013)380 nm) UV photolysis of 

H2O2  present  in  the  matrix.56  Accordingly,  H2O2  yields  two  OH  radicals  upon  dissociating, 

which spontaneously produce H atoms in the immediate reaction with H2.27,41 The combination 

of these different procedures helps discriminate the products with H atoms from the possible 

minor side products generated in a reaction with Cl atom. 

15 

 
Examples for H atom reaction in solid para-H2 conducted on VIZSLA include the successive 

hydrogenation of SO and SO2, and the H atom abstraction from glycine resulting in C(cid:68)-glycyl 

radical.57,58

Spectrum recorded after deposition of the para-H2 : Cl2 (~800 : 1) sample on the substrate of

energy at the substrate). (c) Spectrum measured after subsequent irradiation with a NIR light of 
2217 nm  for  44 min  (P  (cid:167)  3.4 mJ  pulse  energy  @  10  Hz  at the  laser  aperture,  0.57 mJ  pulse 
energy at the substrate). The laser light was made divergent using a lens in order to enlarge the 
laser beam area so that the whole substrate could be uniformly irradiated. 

C.  Generation of protonated species in solid para-H2 

Para-H2 ice is also suitable for the investigation of protonated species. An electron gun can be 

used to generate H+ (and Hn

+) ions. In practice 200 eV to 2 MeV electrons with a current from 

0.1 to 60 (cid:151)A are used.31,59 With our setup 2.0 to 5.0 keV electrons with currents of 20 to 500 nA 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were tested. We have  found that electron irradiation can  be applied during deposition  but to 

avoid interaction of the electrons with the gold surface, which was found to cause deterioration 

of  the  matrix,  initially  a  para-H2 layer  without  electron  irradiation  has  to  be  deposited.  The 

minimum thickness of this layer was estimated by the CASINO program60 and was found to be 

650 and 3000 nm for 2.0 and 5.0 keV electrons, respectively. To avoid Coulomb explosion, the 

electron  gun  was  operated  periodically,  using  5(cid:3013)15 min  on/off  cycles,  while  continuously 

depositing the matrix. To show the performance of our setup, the experiment of Tsuge et al. for 

the  generation  of  XeHXe+  ions59  were  reproduced  and  the  spectrum  taken  during  this 

experiment is displayed in Fig. 7.

D.  TPD ‒ matrix-isolation redeposition experiments: Demonstration of feasibility  

As  mentioned  in  the  Introduction,  the  other  function  of  VIZSLA  allows  the  processing  of 

astrophysical  ices  followed  by  sublimation  (i.e.,  temperature-programmed  desorption,  TPD) 

and  parallel  matrix-isolation  redeposition  for  IR  spectroscopic  measurement.  Since  the 

molecules isolated in an inert, weakly-interacting (e.g., Ar) matrix have sharp bands and well-

resolved  IR  spectra,  by  comparing  the  measured  spectra  of  the  redeposited  species  with 

literature  matrix-isolation  IR  spectra  (or  with  computed  IR  spectra)  reliable,  unambiguous 

molecular identification can be made. First, we demonstrate the feasibility and the strengths of 

the method, then we provide efficiency measurements of the redeposition, finally, we show two 

applications on a processed astrophysical ice.  

17 

 
 
 
 
 
In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we have studied three different ices:  sulfur 

dioxide  (SO2),  methanol  (CH3OH),  and  the  1 : 1 : 1  mixture  of  methanol  (CH3OH),  ethanol 

(CH3CH2OH), and isopropanol ((CH3)2HOH). The first two systems were chosen because of 

the  possible  formation  of  clusters  at  the  sublimation  with  different  extent  due  to  different 

strengths of secondary chemical bonds. This effect  has to be explored in details, because the 

possible  deposition  of  different  clusters  could  result  in  a  spectral  broadening,  and  therefore, 

could seriously limit the application of the method. The mixture was chosen to demonstrate and 

test the analytical strength of the method for discriminating between molecules possessing the 

same functional group. 

In each case, the gas (or gas mixture) was first deposited on the substrate of the 4-kelvin cryostat 

unit  at  3.1 K.  Then  a  TPD  process  was  started.  Some  10(cid:177)20 K  below  the  sublimation 

temperature of the sample the 4-kelvin was rotated and the 10-kelvin cryostat was lowered into 

the IR beam position, facing with the substrate of the 4-kelvin  head. The Ar was  introduced 

into the chamber, near the substrate by the dual-capillary inlet. The sublimed molecules mixed 

with Ar, and were deposited on the substrate of the 10-K cryostat at 11 K. During the matrix-

isolation redeposition 64-scan averaged IR spectra were recorded each minute.  

Fig. 8(a) shows the spectrum of an SO2 neat film freshly deposited on the 4-kelvin substrate at 

3.1 K.  As  expected,  the  spectrum  of  the  film  exhibits  broad  features  due  to  the  various 

intermolecular  interactions within the solid.  Fig. 8(b) shows the IR spectrum taken  from the 

sublimed  molecules  redeposited  in  an  Ar  matrix  on  the  substrate  of  the  10-kelvin  cryostat. 

Based on the comparison of the two spectra one can immediately see the advantage of the higher 

resolution for analytical identification purposes. Although the lines (at 1351.1 and 1355.3 cm(cid:237)1, 

as well as at 1147.1 and 1152.2 cm(cid:3013)1) are split due to different sites in Ar matrix, this is well-

documented  in  the  literature.61  In this  case,  only  a  small  amount  of  dimer  was  observed  (at 

1341.5 cm(cid:3013)1) in the sample redeposited in Ar matrix.62

FIG. 8. MIR spectra of SO2 in the 1100(cid:3013)1400 cm(cid:3013)1 region. (a) SO2 thin film freshly deposited 
on the substrate of the 4-kelvin cryostat at 3.1 K. (b) Sample redeposited and isolated in an Ar 
matrix on the substrate of the 10-kelvin cryostat at 11 K during a TPD process performed on 
the 4-kelvin cryostat between 85 and 115 K at a rate of 1 K min(cid:237)1. (cid:181)M(cid:182) denotes the monomers, 
whereas (cid:181)D(cid:182) stands for dimers. 

The next example, in Fig. 9, demonstrates a similar experiment on CH3OH. The same applies 

here as for SO2, the IR absorption features of the CH3OH ice are broad and unresolved, which 

is greatly improved by redepositing the CH3OH and isolating it in an Ar matrix during the TPD 

process. Although CH3OH can form clusters by strong hydrogen bonds, and likely these clusters 

are present in the gas phase near the surface of the ice, almost exclusively the IR band of the 

monomer can be detected at 1033.5 cm(cid:237)1.63 The dimers(cid:182) and oligomers(cid:182) weak peaks show up 

at 1029.0, 1038.4, and 1053.4 cm(cid:237)1, respectively.64 The possible plausible explanation for this 

phenomenon  is that the CH3OH aggregates are mostly destroyed  in the gas phase  due to the 

collision  with  Ar  atoms,  which  are  present  in  great  excess  in  the  space  between  the  two 

substrates. Consequently, this experiment proves that the method also allows for the study of 

the monomeric form of substances known for their tendency to aggregate.

the 4-kelvin cryostat between 85 and 180 K at a rate of 1 K min(cid:237)1. 

The third example (Fig. 10) demonstrates that the method is also suitable to study  mixtures. 

The 1:1:1 mixture of methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and isopropanol ((CH3)2HOH) 

was processed similarly as the pure SO2 and CH3OH ices. The lower panel depicts the spectrum 

of the mixture deposited on the substrate of the 4-kelvin cryostat at 3.1 K (Fig. 10(a)). On the 

basis of this spectrum, one  might deduce that alcohols are present in the sample, but further 

analytical identification could be barely made on the safe ground. The upper panel shows three 

spectra recorded from the redeposited sample  in  an Ar  matrix at three different stages of the

resolution  was  set  to  1 cm(cid:237)1.  (cid:181)M(cid:182),  (cid:181)E(cid:182),  and  (cid:181)iP(cid:182)  denote  the  bands  of  methanol,  ethanol,  and 
isopropanol, respectively. 

It is important to note and explore if the Ar flow shifts the sublimation temperatures. Typically, 

for isolation of molecules, Ar has to be used in an excess of 1 : 1000 or more. This means that 

it has a significant pressure at the surface. Although Ar is not reactive, the increased background 

pressure due to Ar might trap reactive intermediates on the surface, which species could sublime 

into the gas phase at normal (UHV) conditions. Then these species might react with each other 

on the surface resulting in secondary products. It cannot be ruled out, however, that this effect 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is  counteracted,  because  high-temperature  Ar  atoms  are  bombarding  the  surface,  and  they 

possibly release  molecules from the ice below the sublimation temperature.  These should be 

investigated  further  in  future  studies  when  desorption  of  reactive  species/radicals  can  be 

expected. To understand the effect of Ar flow the mass spectra of the subliming molecules and 

the IR spectra of the ice during a TPD process once without and once with Ar flow could be 

measured and compared. 

E.  TPD ‒ matrix-isolation redeposition experiments: Efficiency measurements  

For future applications,  it is  important to quantify the efficiency of the sublimation  (cid:177)  matrix 

isolation redeposition. The integrated absorption area of a band measured in a thin film cannot 

be  compared  directly  to  the  one  measured  in  an  Ar  matrix,  because  the  intermolecular 

interactions  might  considerably  affect  the  molar  absorptions.  Therefore,  another  experiment 

had to be carried out to find a definite answer for this question. In this case, first a sample : Ar 

= 1 : 1000 (in the case of SO2) or 1 : 10000 (for CH3OH) mixture was deposited on the substrate 

of  the  4-kelvin  cryostat  at  3.1 K.  Then,  the  sample  was  slowly  heated  to  the  sublimation 

temperature of Ar. After the complete sublimation of Ar (followed by the pressure gauge), a 

TPD (cid:177) matrix-isolation redeposition experiment as described in Section III.E. was carried out. 

Using this procedure, the integrated band areas measured in an Ar matrix on the 4-kelvin and 

on the 10-kelvin cryostat can safely be compared. However, it has to be kept in mind, that the 

determination of the efficiency by this way gives a lower estimate for the efficiency,  because 

Ar is applied in great excess and during the sublimation of Ar some of the sample molecules 

can be lost.  

Using the doublet IR band of the matrix-isolated SO2 at 1351.1 and 1355.3 cm(cid:237)1 the integrated 

band  areas  of  the  freshly  deposited  matrix  on the  4-kelvin  cryostat  and the  one  after TPD  (cid:177) 

redeposition onto the 10-kelvin cryostat were found to be 1.293 and 0.104 cm(cid:237)1, respectively 

(Fig. 11). This means that approximately 8.0% of the initial SO2 molecules deposited onto the 

substrate of the 4-kelvin cryostat could be recaptured on the substrate of the 10-kelvin cryostat.

isolated in an Ar matrix on the substrate of the 4-kelvin cryostat at 3.1 K. The spectral resolution 
was set to 1 cm(cid:237)1. (b) SO2 film after subliming the Ar at 70 K (spectral resolution: 4 cm(cid:237)1, offset

The efficiency of the redeposition process has been determined in a similar method for CH3OH, 

too. Fig. 12 shows the IR spectra of the compound isolated in Ar  matrix before and after the 

TPD  process  on  the  substrates  of  the  4-kelvin  and  the  10-kelvin  cryostat,  respectively.  The 

integrated  band  areas  of  the  1033.8 cm(cid:237)1  feature  are  2.547  and  0.251 cm(cid:237)1,  respectively, 

meaning an overall redeposition efficiency of roughly 9.9%. This is in an agreement with the 

efficiency value determined for the SO2.  

The effect of the Ar flow rate on the recondensation efficiency was also studied. Three different 

Ar inlet rates were used (0.2, 0.7, and 2.0 mbar(cid:194)L min(cid:3013)1) but no significant differences could be 

found in the efficiency (0.132, 0.129, and 0.116, respectively). In contrast to this, the relative 

efficiency could be increased by some 50% to 0.192 when the quadruple-capillary array was 

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
used instead of the dual one (Ar flow was kept at 0.35 mbar(cid:194)L min(cid:3013)1). It should also be noted 

that when using lower Ar inlet rates, not only the CH3OH monomer could be observed but also 

minor  bands  caused  by  the  oligomers,  which  were  not taken  into  account  by  this  estimation 

discussed above.

In conclusion, the efficiency of the TPD (cid:3013) matrix-isolation redeposition is roughly between 8 

and 20%, depending on the sample, on the Ar flow rate, on the capillary used, and although, it 

is not tested, certainly on the distance of the two substrates. However, it should be noted, as 

demonstrated  in  Section  III.E.,  due to the  sharp  lines  in  an  Ar  matrix  compared  to the  ones 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
observed in a neat ice, some bands can appear with larger absorbance in the redeposited matrix, 

even if 80(cid:3013)90% of the sample is lost during the redeposition. 

F.  TPD ‒ matrix-isolation redeposition experiments: Tests on processed astrophysical 

analogue ices  

In the case of processed astrophysical analogue ices usually several products are generated upon 

the irradiation. These products have a mixing ratio usually much smaller than the compounds 

in  the  deposited,  unprocessed  ice;  furthermore, the  products  are usually  generated  with  very 

different  efficiencies.  In  order  to  test  the  applicabilit(cid:92)  of  the  TPD  (cid:3013)  matri(cid:91)-isolation 

redeposition experiments  for realistic processed  ices, we have chosen two different systems, 

which were recently studied extensively. 

The first test system is the irradiated methanol ice. Both the effects of the electron and the H 

Lyman-(cid:68) irradiations have already been investigated.67(cid:177)69 The products were analyzed on the 

basis  of  the  IR  spectrum  of  the  processed  ice  and  on  the  basis  of  the  mass  spectra  of  the 

subliming  molecules upon the TPD process. In the case of the two different irradiations, the 

same main products were identified. Here we have chosen to reproduce the experiment of the 

H  Lyman-(cid:68)  irradiation  of  the  methanol  ice  at  12  K.  Since  the  TPD  (cid:3013)  matri(cid:91)-isolation 

redeposition  FT-IR  analysis  is  expected to  be  less  sensitive,  to  accumulate  more  products,  a 

thicker film was deposited (absorbance of the most intense methanol band at ~1020 cm(cid:3013)1 was 

~0.9 vs 0.2) and a longer irradiation time (758 vs 60 min) was applied. (The longer irradiation 

time was also necessary, because in our setup the H lamp is farther from the substrate than in 

Ref 69.) 

Fig 13. shows the IR spectrum of the deposited ice, the irradiated ice and spectra taken from 

the sample redeposited onto the substrate of the 10-kelvin cryostat. The different spectra of the 

redeposited sample collected at different temperature regions of the TPD process are shown. 

The products identified in the Ar matrix are collected in Table 1. As it can be seen most of the 

products  identified  by  the  earlier  studies:  methane  (CH4),  carbon  monoxide  (CO),  carbon 

dioxide (CO2), formaldehyde (H2CO), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), dimethyl ether (H3COCH3), 

methyl formate (HCOOCH3), ethylene glycol (HO(CH2)2OH), and tentatively, ketene (H2CCO), 

and ethylene oxide ((CH2)2O) are also trapped and identifiable in the spectrum of the matrix-

isolated,  redeposited  sample.  In  many  cases  of  the  former  studies,  the  identification  of  the 

products was possible only on the basis of careful, synchronous analysis of IR and mass spectra. 

25 

 
 
In the present case, the precise line positions of the measured spectra can be directly compared 

to literature Ar-matrix IR spectral data, band deconvolution and the analysis of  mass spectra 

are not required for unambiguous identification.

For  another  test  case  the  electron  irradiation  of  the  NH3 : O2  ice,  investigated  recently  by 

Tsegaw et al., was chosen.70 In Ref 70, besides nitrogen oxides, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) was 

identified as the main product. The identification of the products was based on the IR spectrum 

of the processed ice, and on the PI-ReTOF mass analysis. For ionization 10.49 eV photons were 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
used. Similar studies on the same ice identified basically the same products by IR spectroscopy 

of the ice and by electron impact mass spectrometry.71

In our case, to accumulate more products for the TPD (cid:3013) matri(cid:91)-isolation redeposition FT-IR 

analysis, 6 deposition (ca. 500 nm for the first layer, ~200 nm in the case of the next layers) (cid:3013) 

electron irradiation cycles (30 min each) were repeated. Here we do not report the full analysis 

of the redeposited, matrix-isolated products, only the most interesting and exciting results are 

shown. The lower panel of Fig. 14 depicts the IR spectrum recorded after depositing the first 

layer  of  the  ice  together  with  the  spectrum  recorded  after  electron  irradiation.  (The  same 

spectral changes were observed for the additional ice deposition (cid:177) electron irradiation cycles.)

a short literature search it was easy to identify unambiguously t-HONO (18 in Fig. 14) at 3568.4, 

1688.1, 1265.8, 1263.8, 800.6, and 796.6 cm(cid:3013)1 (vs.  literature data at  3568.5, 1688.0, 1265.8, 

1263.9, 800.4, and 796.6 cm(cid:3013)1),88 c-HONO (19) at 1632.8 and 850.2 cm(cid:3013)1 (vs. literature data at 

1632.8 and 850.2 cm(cid:3013)1),88 H2O2 (20) at 1277.5 and 1270.9 cm(cid:3013)1 (vs. literature data at  1277.0 

and  1270.9 cm(cid:3013)1),89  HNO3 (21)  at  1699.4  and  1321.2 cm(cid:3013)1  (vs.  literature  data  at  1699.4  and 

1321.4 cm(cid:3013)1),90  and  c-HOONO  (22)  at  3302.4,  1600.8,  1391.5 cm(cid:3013)1  (vs.  literature  data  at 

3303(cid:147)1, 1600.6(cid:147)0.6, and 1392(cid:147)1 cm(cid:3013)1).91 It is worth noting that two bands at 1235 and 796 cm-1 

can be clearly seen in the spectrum of the processed ice after the evaporation of O2, both in our 

spectrum and that in Ref. 70. And although these two bands were assigned to a different species 

(i.e., to N2O2) before, based on their positions, they could possibly belong to t-HONO. These 

molecules could not be seen in the PI-ReTOF mass spectra, since they have an ionization energy 

higher than the applied 10.49 eV photon energy.70 While upon electron impact ionization they 

yield the same fragments as nitrogen oxides and hydroxylamine. Therefore, the present example 

proves  that  the  TPD  (cid:3013)  matri(cid:91)-isolation  redeposition  analysis  is  a  powerful  alternative  and 

complementary  tool  to  other  analytical  methods  in  the  analysis  of  processed  astrophysical 

analogue ices. 

IV. ASTROCHEMICAL POTENTIAL 

Now it is well-accepted by astrochemists that without the consideration and investigation of the 

low-temperature solid-state chemical processes, taking place on the surface of icy grains, the 

composition of the gaseous interstellar matter cannot be understood. Although there are many 

setups  constructed  for  understanding  the  chemistry  induced  by  different  particles  and 

irradiations,  it  is  usually  challenging  to  identify  all  the  molecules  produced  in  the  ice  and 

desorbing  at  a  certain  temperature  to  the  gaseous  phase.  This  is  mostly  due  to  the  low 

concentration  of  the  products  and  the  short  time  window  offered  by  the  TPD  process  for 

spectroscopic analysis. A more sensitive frequently used analysis method, the electron impact 

ionization  mass  spectrometry  has  the  disadvantage  that  several  molecules  can  have  similar 

fragmentation patterns or the parent ion can be completely missing from the spectrum due to 

fragmentation. A solution  for this problem was developed  by the group of Kaiser,11 who are 

using  photoioni(cid:93)ation  with  ver(cid:92)  sensitive  mass  detection.  The  TPD  (cid:3013)  matri(cid:91)-isolation 

redeposition FT-IR spectral analysis, available by VIZSLA and discussed in this paper as an 

30 

 
 
alternative and, as it is demonstrated, a complementary method to solve this problem and help 

the analysis of the molecules desorbing from the ice. 

VIZSLA is also suitable to study reactions of astrochemical molecules with H atoms and H+ 

ions  in  para-H2.  Although  solid  para-H2  is  not  a  typical  astrophysical  environment,  as  it  is 

colder and less polar than a typical astrophysical ice, it provides excellent conditions for very 

sensitive monitoring of these processes for first glance. VIZSLA has the unique opportunity, 

that the processes observed and identified in solid para-H2, can be studied further with the same 

setup  in  astrophysically  more  relevant  ice  conditions.  The  versatile  irradiation  and  particle 

sources  available  on  VIZSLA,  are  also  important  in  a  view,  that  the  effect  of  different 

irradiations  can  be  compared  under  the  same  conditions.  It offers  the  unique  opportunity  to 

compare the outcome of different type of experiments as well, that otherwise would be difficult 

to do when the results were obtained in different setups under different conditions.  

Besides  understanding  solid-state  astrophysical  processes,  VIZSLA  can  provide  important 

spectral and chemical information for flag-ship missions of ESA and NASA. These agencies 

scheduled the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for late 2021.5 This mission will 

detect  the  interstellar  matter  in  the  infrared  region  with  unprecedented  spectral  and  special 

resolution.  As  it  is  expected,  it  will  provide  spectral  information  not  only  on  the  gaseous 

interstellar matter, but also on icy dust grains, and maybe on atmospheres of exoplanets. Jupiter 

Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), an upcoming mission of ESA will provide chemical information 

on  other,  closer  icy  objects.92  To  understand  the  data  collected  by  these  space  missions, 

extensive  laboratory astrochemistry research  is required,  in which VIZSLA can  have a great 

contribution. Furthermore, the analysis of the molecules desorbing from the ices can provide a 

valuable list of molecules that can be potentially present in the gaseous phase of ISM and can 

be searched for example by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) telescope.93 

It is planned that the different irradiation sources and the sensitivity of VIZSLA will be further 

calibrated against other ice setups. It is also under consideration that, in part-time, VIZSLA will 

be offered for collaborations under the EUROPLANET organization.94
