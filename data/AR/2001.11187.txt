Abstract 
n-type conductivity of β-Ga2O3 grown from the melt is typically achieved using Sn and Si. In 
this paper, we experimentally and computationally investigate Hf doping of β-Ga2O3 single 
crystals using UV-Vis-NIR absorption and Hall Effect measurements and  hybrid functional 
calculations. Unintentionally-doped and Hf-doped samples with a nominal concentration of 
0.5at% were grown from the melt using vertical gradient freeze (VGF) and Czochralski 
method in mixed Ar+O2 atmosphere. We demonstrate Hf dopants, predicted to incorporate on 
the octahedral GaII site as a shallow donor, achieve degenerate doping in β-Ga2O3 with a 
measured electron concentration ~2x1019cm-3, mobility 80-65cm2/Vs, and resistivity down to 
5mΩ-cm in our samples. The concentration of Hf was measured to be 1.3x1019 atoms/cm3 
using glow discharge mass spectroscopy (GDMS) on doped samples, confirming Hf to be the 
cause of n-type conductivity (electron concentration ~2x1019cm-3).

1. Introduction 

β-Ga2O3 is the most thermodynamically stable polymorph 
of Ga2O3 with monoclinic crystal structure and has been the 
focus of increasing attention and development in recent years 
for  Schottky  diodes,  high  breakdown  voltage  switching 
devices,  solar-  and  visible-blind  photodetectors,  and  gas 
sensing devices [1-5]. The rapid development has been aided 
by the availability of β-Ga2O3 single crystals by Czochralski 
(CZ),  Edge-defined  fed-film  (EFG),  vertical  gradient  freeze 
(VGF), float zone (FZ), vertical Bridgman (VB), and Verneuil 
methods [1-10]. β-Ga2O3 is of interest due to being ultrawide-
bandgap  semiconducting  oxide  with  bandgap  of  4.5-4.9eV 

depending  on  the  polarization  and  crystal  orientation,  and 
tunable electrical conductivity [1-7, 11].  

Insulating β-Ga2O3 has been achieved by oxygen annealing 
or by doping with Fe or Mg which act as deep acceptors [12, 
13]. Unintentionally doped (UID) β-Ga2O3 is typically n-type 
conducting  with  free  electron  density  of  over  1x1017cm-3, 
which is attributed to Si impurities [14, 15]. In addition to Si, 
tunable  n-type  conductivity  in  β-Ga2O3  has  been  typically 
achieved with Sn and Ge, and also, but less studied, with Ta 
and Nb; free electron density (n) ranging between 1x1017cm-3 
to 2x1019cm-3, mobility (µ) decreasing with increasing n and 
ranging  between  130cm2/Vs 
room 
temperature, resistivity (ρ) down to 5mΩ-cm, and activation 
energy  (Ed)  decreasing  with  increasing  n  between  7meV  to 
30meV has been realized with these dopants [3, 6, 14, 16-23]. 

to  25cm2/Vs  at 

 
 
 
Si  and  Sn  doping  in  bulk  crystals  have  been  limited  to 
2x1019cm-3  due  to  the  second  phase  formation  and  crystal 
quality degradation with Si doping [16], and high evaporation 
rate of Sn [13, 14]. Ge-doped β-Ga2O3, to our knowledge, has 
never been grown as bulk single crystals due to the high vapor 
pressure of Ge.  

for  n 

(6.5x1017cm-3 

to  5x1018cm-3), 

Recently, we have achieved tunable n-type conductivity of 
bulk  β-Ga2O3  with  Zr  doping  and  obtained  favorable 
room 
properties 
temperature  µ  (112cm2/Vs  to  75cm2/Vs),  ρ  (down  to 
17mΩcm),  and  Ed  (~13meV  to  below  4meV)  [24].  Our 
analysis  revealed  that  Zr  showed  a  strong  preference  to 
substitute for Ga on the octahedral site (GaII), and our initial 
results identified that Zr doping shows promise for obtaining 
improved mobilities compared to other dopants in the regime 
of  degenerate  doping.  Here  we  explore  analogous  dopants 
from the group d2 block of the periodic table, and identify Hf 
as an additional shallow donor dopant candidate in β-Ga2O3. 
We demonstrate both experimentally and theoretically that Hf 
dopants  act  as  a  soluble  shallow  donor  that  can  be  used  to 
achieve  degenerate  doping  in  bulk  crystals  with  mobility 
comparable to or better than those achieved with Zr doping. 

2. Experimental 

UID  and  0.5at%  Hf-doped  β-Ga2O3  (Hf:β-Ga2O3)  were 
grown  from  the  melt  similar  to  what  has  been  previously 
published  [24]. 5N  purity  β-Ga2O3  source  powder  was  used 
for  all  samples.  For  the  Hf-doped  samples,  the  same  source 
powder was mixed for 18 hours in a ball mill at 50rpm with 
0.5at% 3N pure HfO2 powder; the 0.5at% is with respect to 
Ga2O3 (i.e. 0.25at% with respect to Ga). For both growths, two 
charges were prepared 400-450g each, pressed at 20kpsi, then 
calcined in an alumina crucible lined with Pt foil at 1500°C 
for 15 hours. The first charge was first melted, then the second 
charge  was  added  to  increase  the  volume  of  the  molten 
material. The charges were melted, and the crystals were then 
grown in 70mm height by 70mm diameter Iridium crucible by 
a  25KHz  radio  frequency  inductive  heating  coil.  Ar+O2  gas 
mixture  was  used  during  the  melting    and  the  growth  with 
O2<0.2% below 1200°C to limit solid IrO2 formation, O2 ~3%-
5% between 1200°C and initial melting of Ga2O3 to reduce the 
decomposition  and  evaporation  of  Ga2O3,  and  10%-12% 
during the melting and growth. The O2 content was dropped 
again to 3% during cooling, and to <0.1% below 1200°C. The 
Hf:β-Ga2O3  was  grown  by  unseeded  VGF  in  the  Iridium 
crucible  by  cooling  over  the  period  of  24-30  hours.  UID 
crystals were grown by both CZ using a pull rate of 2mm/hr 
and 2rpm rotation and VGF with no rotation; the CZ crystal 
was spiral. Samples for UID crystal were obtained from both 
the VGF and CZ pulled crystals. 

All the tested crystals were obtained by cleaving along the 
(100) plane; the samples surface had the (100) orientation as 
confirmed by electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) and 

the 
Laue  diffraction  measurements,

NIR region between 200-3300nm was measured using Cary5 
instrument  to  evaluate  the  bandedge  and  sub-bandgap 
absorption.

in 

Ohmic  contacts  of  50wt%Ga-50wt%In  were  obtained  by 
placing  them  on  a  freshly  cleaved  surface  followed  by 
annealing  at 950°C  for  15  minutes;  this  procedure  has  been 
shown previously to yield ohmic contacts down to ~20K [24]. 
Temperature dependent Hall Effect measurements using 0.51 
T magnetic field were performed between 80K and  320K with 
10K temperature step using Ecopia HMS 7000 using the Ga-
In contacts in van der Pauw configuration.  

3. Theoretical Assessment 

To theoretically assess the solubility and electrical behavior 
expected  for  Hf  incorporated  as  a  function  of  growth  and 
doping conditions, we computed the defect formation energies 
(Ef) within a supercell approach, as previously performed to 
assess  Zr  dopants  [25].  We  adopt 
the  exact  same 
computational procedure as in [24, 26, 27], where all defects 
were  modeled  within  160-atom  supercell  representations  of 
bulk  β-Ga2O3,  and  total  energies  were  computed  using  the 
Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof screened hybrid functional (HSE06) 
as  implemented  in  the  VASP  code  [28-30].  The  atomic 
potentials  were  treated  within  projector-augmented  wave 
(PAW)  [31]  approach  and  included  the  4s2 3d10 4p1  (Ga), 
3p64s23d2 (Ti), 4s24p65s24d2 (Zr), and 5p66s25d2 (Hf) orbitals 
as valence electrons. The fraction of Hartree-Fock mixing was 
set to 32%, which yields band gaps and lattice  properties in 
good agreement with experimental values [26]. The solubility-
limiting phases considered for the defect formation energies 
of  all  extrinsic  dopants  were  taken  from  the  calculated 
formation enthalpies of the binary-oxide rutile phases of TiO2 
(ΔΗ=–9.68 eV), ZrO2 (ΔΗ=–10.60 eV), and HfO2 (ΔΗ=–11.29 
eV) using the same Hartree-Fock mixing.

UID crystals were mostly clear to slightly yellow in color 
(Figure 1(a)), but UID samples obtained from the bottom of 
the crucible were slightly brown in color (Figure 1(b)). The Hf 
samples,  similar  to  Zr  doped,  were  blue  in  color  but 
transparent and clear (Figure 1(c,d)). NIR absorption spectra 
is shown in Figure 1. Free  carrier absorption can be seen to 
increase  with  Hf  doping.  The  UID  samples  vary  slightly  in 
their free carrier absorption in the NIR. The spectrum in the 
UV-VIS region did not show any additional absorptions and 
hence is not shown here. 

Hall measurements on twelve Hf-doped samples obtained 
from  different  locations  from  the  same  boule  show  the 
electron  concentration  at  room  temperature  (n)  to  vary 
between 7.5x1018cm-3 to 1.9x1019cm-3 and resistivity between 
12.5mΩ-cm to 5.2mΩ-cm; eight of the Hf-doped samples are 
shown as example in Table 1. The variation shows that n, and 
in-turn  the  Hf  concentration, increases  vertically  toward  the 
bottom of the boule indicating a segregation coefficient of less 
than 1, and decreases radially toward the edges  of the boule 
indicating  a  possible  convex  solid/liquid  interface;  this 
interface  increases  the  tendency  of  spiral  growth,  and  the 
interface  is  also  typical  for  highly  doped  and  conductive  β-
Ga2O3  due 
free  carrier  absorption.  The  electron 
concentration  achieved  with  Hf  doping  is  higher  than  that 
reached  with  Zr  for  the  same  nominal  addition  of  doping 
(0.5at%)  in  the melt.  On  the basis  that  Hf  incorporates  as a 
shallow  donor,  this  suggests  that  Hf  may  be  more  readily 
incorporated 
than  Zr,  which  we  find  consistent  with 
theoretical predictions as described below. XRD on the lowest 
part of the grown Hf-doped boule, which is expected to have 
the highest amount of Hf, did not show any signs of secondary 
phases; this indicates a possibility that even higher doping of 
Hf could be achieved.

Insulating 

The Hf-doped samples show higher n than the UID samples 
which  vary  between  4.5x1017cm-3  to  semi-insulating.  The 
lower n in the UID samples confirm that Hf is the cause of the 
conductivity 
the  Hf-doped  samples.  The  electron 
concentration  in  UID  samples  is  possibly  due  to  Si  residual 
impurities and this has been observed by others [14, 15]. The 

in 

semi-insulating  samples  were  obtained  by  the  VGF  boule 
close  to  the  bottom  edge  of  the  crucible  and  showed  a 
brownish  color  which  could  potentially  be  due  to  Fe 
impurities.  

Fe impurities, which would tend to be higher at the bottom 
of the boule, have been measured as an impurity in our raw 
Ga2O3 powder as shown in glow-discharge mass spectroscopy 
measurements done by EAG and shown in the Supplementary 
Material. Fe concentration is ~8.2x1016 atoms/cm3 in the raw 
powder used, and Si concentration is ~8.3x1017 atoms/cm3. Sn 
and Ge, the other possible suspects for n-type conductivity in 
β-Ga2O3 were not detected in our raw materials, and are not 
typically  measured  impurities  in  β-Ga2O3  unless  they  are 
intentionally added. Further, neither Si, Sn, nor Ge has been 
shown  to  show  degenerate  doping  with  2x1019cm-3  free 
electron concentration as observed here; which suggests Hf is 
most likely responsible for the observed carrier concentration. 
Secondary Ion Mass spectroscopy (SIMS), was not possible to 
quantify Hf concentration due to the lack of standards, but the 
Hf existence has been confirmed with energy dispersive x-ray 
spectroscopy (EDS) in our Hf doped samples as shown in the 
Supplementary  Material.  Finally,  GDMS  on  the  Hf-doped 
samples  has  been  conducted  and 
the 
Supplementary  Materials;  the  GDMS  results  show  Hf  of 
1.3x1019atoms/cm3  which  is  close  to  the  measured  n  and 
confirm the incorporation of Hf, and show Si, Zr, and Fe to be 
2.5x1017atoms/cm3, 
and 
8.3x1016atoms/cm3, respectively. Sn and Ge  were below the 
detection limits.

Temperature  dependent  Hall  effect  measurements  show 
degenerate  doping  in  the  Hf-doped  samples  as  shown  in 
Figure 2(a); n remains constant with decreasing temperature 
which  has  not  been  shown  with  bulk  single  crystalline  β-
Ga2O3, whereas the UID samples show a decrease in  n with 
decreasing 
temperature  and  activation  energy  between 
10.8meV to 13.8meV.Mobility µ, as shown in Table 1, in the 
Hf-doped  samples  ranges  between  80cm2/Vs  and  50cm2/Vs 
which is found to generally, but not necessarily, decrease with 
increasing n. The achieved µ is higher than reported for other 
dopants  for  the  same  doping  level,  and  higher  than  that 
achieved with our previous Zr doping results [24]. The UID 
crystals show lower µ for an even lower n than both Zr and the 
Hf-doped  crystals  confirming  that  a  different  impurity, 
possibly Si along with compensation from Fe impurities is the 
cause of n-type doping in our UID crystals. Fig. 2(a,c) shows 
the carrier concentration, resistivity and mobility as a function 
of  temperature  for  representative  Hf  and  UID  crystals.  The 
samples  are  expected  to  have  similar  structural  quality  (Hf, 
UID, and Zr) as they were produced by the same method and 
procedure,  and  all  the  samples  were  taken  from  twin  free 
regions  (observed  by  cross-polarized  light).  For  the  same 
reason, it is quite difficult to compare the mobilities presented 
here to those in the literature, as the structural quality are not

always  available  in  the  literature,  and  they  were  not  fully 
evaluated in the samples presented here. 

These  Hall  effect  measurements  were  confirmed  with 
another set of independent measurements performed using a 
Lakeshore  7507  system  between  12-320K  with  Indium 
contacts; n remained constant to 12K. n were also confirmed 
with  quantum  magnetoconductivity  measurements  (QMC); 
the low temperature Hall effect and QMC results will be the 
subject of a different paper. 

In  Figure  3,  we  show  the  calculated  defect  formation 
energy diagram for Hf and Zr dopants, for Ga-rich and O-rich 
growth  extremes.  Our  results  identify  Hf  and  Zr  behave 
similarly, most favorably incorporating on the octahedral GaII 
site  and  behaving  as  shallow  donors.  Hf  is  found  to  exhibit 
slightly lower formation energies than Zr in both O-rich and 
Ga-rich  extremes,  with  more  Ga-rich  conditions  leading  to 
higher  solubilities  owing  to  less  competition  with  ZrO2  and 
HfO2 phases. Both dopants also behave as shallow donors on 
the tetrahedral GaI site, but have far higher formation energy 
and  not  expected  to  appreciably  incorporate  on  these  sites. 
Thus Hf is expected to be a more soluble donor dopant than 
Zr for all conditions, consistent with the realization of higher 
carrier  concentrations  in  the  Hf-doped  single  crystals  as 
compared to Zr-doped samples for the same nominal doping 
concentrations (0.5at%) [24].  

Figure 3. Defect formation energies for Hf, Zr, and Ti substitutional 
dopants in β-Ga2O3, shown for (a) Ga-rich and (b) O-rich growth 
extremes. HfGa shallow donors are found to be more soluble than 
ZrGa dopants. 

By analogy with Zr and Hf, we also calculated the behavior 
of TiGa as a candidate donor dopant to see if it also exhibited 
similar  electronic  behavior.  In  contrast  to  Hf  and  Zr,  TiGa 
dopants lead to deep, rather than shallow donor behavior, with 
a  (+/0)  transition  level  1.18  eV  below  the  conduction  band 
edge (3.37 eV above the VBM) for the more favorable TiGaII. 
This  is  due  to  the  higher  lying  position  of  the  d  states 
associated with the dopants going down the group [32], with 
the lowest-lying Ti 3d states leading to deep states within the 
band gap. This is supported by analysis of the density of states 
of the Zr and Hf dopants, whose lowest  d-derived states for 
the donor configurations fall 1.65 eV and 2.25 eV above the 
conduction band minimum, respectively.  

5. Conclusion 

In conclusion, we showed that Hf, similar to Zr, behaves as 
a  soluble  shallow  donor  in  β-Ga2O3.  We  demonstrated 
degenerate doping with Hf, and electron concentration up to 
2x1019 cm-3 mobility of 80-50cm2/Vs, and resistivity down to 
5mΩ.cm.  Also,  we  confirmed  the  Hf  incorporation  with 
GDMS measurements, which are strongly correlated with the 
free carrier concentration determined via Hall measurements.

Laue Diffraction 

Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) and Energy-
Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) 

EBSD and EDS were performed on a representative Hf:β-
Ga2O3 to confirm the crystal orientation of the sample 
surface and orientations parallel to (or directions 
perpendicular to) the sample edges, and the existence of Hf, 
respectively. The measurements were performed using FEI 
SIRION scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As can be 
seen in Figure S1, the sample surface is the (100) plane, and 
the two other cut/cleaved sample surfaces are the [010] 
direction and the (001) plane. Although the surface is shown 
to be ~3.6° from the (100) plane, this is within the deviation 
range for the measurement. The EDS on the Hf-sample can 
be seen in Figure S2. Ir is an expected impurity as an Ir 
crucible is used. As EDS does not have high sensitivity to 
trace elements (Ir and Hf), the sample measured with EDS 
were from the bottom of the crucible, which is expected to 
have higher amounts of Hf, but these samples did not have 
high optical quality, and were only used with EDS. 

Laue diffraction was conducted at 5N Plus Semiconductors 
(Utah, USA), to confirm the orientation of the sample surface 
with a better accuracy; as shown in Fig. S3, the sample 
surface is within 0.3° from the (100) plane which is within 
the deviation of the measurement set-up. 

Figure S3. Laue diffraction showing the orientation of the 
surface 0.3° off the (100) plane toward the (010) plane. 

Glow Discharge Mass Spectroscopy (GDMS) 

GDMS on the raw powder used in the growth and Hf-doped 
sample were performed at EAG Laboratory (California, 
USA), and the results are summarized in Table S1. The 
results show the detected elements, that were present at 
concentrations above the detection limit.

and a Hf doped crystal measured by GDMS. BDL= below detection 
limit.

color code of 23µm sized area of the sample confirming the sample 
surface to be (100), and a schematic showing the orientation of the 
cut [010] side and the cleaved (001) side of the sample.
