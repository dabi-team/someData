Abstract

A beamline dedicated to the production of laser-polarized radioactive beams has been constructed
at ISOLDE, CERN. We present here diﬀerent simulations leading to the design and construction of
the setup, as well as technical details of the full setup and examples of the achieved polarizations
for several radioisotopes. Beamline simulations show a good transmission through the entire line, in
agreement with observations. Simulations of the induced nuclear spin-polarization as a function of
atom-laser interaction length are presented for 26,28Na, [1] and for 35Ar, which is studied in this work.
Adiabatic spin rotation of the spin-polarized ensemble of atoms, and how this inﬂuences the observed
nuclear ensemble polarization, are also performed for the same nuclei. For 35Ar, we show that multiple-
frequency pumping enhances the ensemble polarization by a factor 1.85, in agreement with predictions
from a rate equations model.

1. Introduction

Spin-polarized radioactive nuclei have been a
staple of nuclear and particle physics research
since the discovery of parity violation [2]. With
the use of polarized nuclei as a probe in ﬁelds
ranging from fundamental interactions to mate-
rial and life sciences [3, 4, 5], an initiative for
a dedicated experiment at ISOLDE was started,
and a beamline was built and commissioned. Re-
sults from the commissioning of the new beamline

are presented in Section 7 and compared to the
observed asymmetries. Conclusions are given in
Section 8.

2. Optical pumping and β-asymmetry

The hyperﬁne interaction couples the nuclear
spin (cid:126)I and the electron spin (cid:126)J together to a total
atomic spin (cid:126)F = (cid:126)I + (cid:126)J, which splits a ﬁne struc-
ture level into several hyperﬁne levels. Atomic
population can be resonantly transferred from
one hyperﬁne level to a radiatively coupled level
through interaction with a narrowband laser. In
this process, conservation of angular momentum
dictates that the atomic spin (cid:126)F can only change
by maximally one unit. The left side of Figure 1
illustrates the 5 allowed hyperﬁne transitions for
the D2 line in 28Na (32S1/2 → 32P 3/2) as solid
lines. The term “optical pumping” is used when
resonant excitations and decay drive the atomic
population towards a speciﬁc (magnetic sub)state
[6].

When the laser light is circularly polarized (σ+
or σ−), conservation of angular momentum fur-
ther imposes the restriction ∆mF = 1 or −1 (in-
dicated as solid lines on the right side of Fig-
ure 1). The decay back to the lower state is
however not bound to this rule and can proceed
with ∆mF = 0, ±1 (indicated by dashed lines)
[7]. By maximizing the number of such exci-
tation/decay cycles, the population of a speciﬁc
F-state is pushed towards substates with either
maximal or minimal mF quantum numbers in the
lowest level.

The number of excitation/decay cycles can
be increased by either increasing the laser pho-
ton density or by having a longer interaction

time.
In a collinear geometry (as used in
high-resolution collinear laser spectroscopy exper-
iments [8]), where the particle and CW laser beam
are spatially overlapped, such an enhanced inter-
action time is achieved by choosing an appropriate
length of the laser-particle interaction region.

The resulting atomic polarization is then trans-
ferred to a polarization of the nuclear spin
through the hyperﬁne interaction. The nuclear
polarization in such an ensemble of nuclei is de-
ﬁned as

P =

(cid:88)

mI

w (mI) mI
I

,

(1)

with w (mI) the probability that the |I, mI(cid:105) quan-
tum state is populated after the optical pumping
process.

The nuclear polarization can be observed by de-
tecting the asymmetry in the β-decay of radioac-
tive isotopes, due to the parity violation in nuclear
β-decay [2]. The β-decay of a polarized ensemble
has a speciﬁc angular distribution that can be re-
duced to W (θ) ∼ 1 + AP cos (θ) for allowed β-
transitions [9], where θ is the angle between the
emitted electron momentum and the nuclear spin
orientation. A is the asymmetry parameter of the
decay which depends on the initial and ﬁnal spin
of the nuclear states involved in the β-decay, and
P is the polarization of the nuclear ensemble with
respect to a quantisation axis. The experimental
asymmetry (as reported in Section 6) is then de-
ﬁned as

Aexp =

N (0◦) − N (180◦)
N (0◦) + N (180◦)

= (cid:15)AP,

where (cid:15) represents depolarization eﬀects which de-
pend on several experimental factors.

For more details on spin-polarization via optical

pumping, see Ref. [10, 11].

3. Beamline description

The laser-polarization setup, part of the Ver-
satile Ion Techniques Online (VITO) beamline at
ISOLDE, CERN [12], is designed to polarize nu-
clei through the application of optical pumping of
an atomic hyperﬁne transition. More than 1000

ISOLDE enters from the top left beampipe, and the start of this beampipe is used as the start for the ion-optical
simulations. The numbers are used to indicate the coils in Table 1.

radioactive isotopes of more than 70 elements can
be produced at ISOLDE, CERN, via the impact
of a 1.4 GeV proton beam on a variety of tar-
gets using diﬀerent types of ion sources [13]. The
ion beam is sent into the laser polarization beam-
line and overlapped with a circularly polarized
laser beam to induce nuclear polarization. After
implantation in a suitable host, placed between
the poles of an electromagnet, the change in β-
asymmetry is observed as a function of laser fre-
quency, scanned across the hyperﬁne structure.
Although the technique is also applicable to ions
[14], the current design is speciﬁc for working with
atoms. An overview of the layout of the entire op-
tical pumping beamline is given in Figure 2.

The ﬁrst element of the beamline is a 5 degree
deﬂector equipped with a laser window, where the
laser beam is overlapped with the pulsed radioac-
tive ion beam. A beam diagnostics box, contain-
ing an adjustable iris to deﬁne the beam waist and
a readout plate for the ion-current, is placed di-
rectly after the deﬂector. Beamline simulations of
the 5 degree deﬂector are discussed in Section 4.
The Charge Exchange Cell (CEC), housed in
the Charge Exchange vacuum chamber of Figure 2
and depicted in Figure 3, is placed after the di-
agnostic box, where the beam passes through a
vapor of Na or K and undergoes charge exchange.
It contains a reservoir in the middle where solid
Na or K is deposited. The stainless steel reser-

ing rods. The liquid cooled heatsink clamps onto the

voir is heated using six RS-8607016 220 W heat-
ing cartridges powered by a DC power supply. To
minimze the diﬀusion of the Na or K vapor to
the rest of the beamline, the ends of the pipe are
kept at a lower temperature. This is achieved
using a heatsink cooled with circulating Galden R(cid:13)
PFPE down to 90◦ C, below the evaporation tem-
perature of Na or K in vacuum. This minimizes
the loss of vapor to the rest of the beamline and
ensures a high vapor density in the middle. Non-
neutralized ions are deﬂected from the beam after

cially designed electrode arrangement (referred to
as voltage scanner, design details in Section 4)
is attached to this cell and modiﬁes the kinetic
energy of the incoming ion beam. This changes
the velocity of the beam, and induces a Doppler
shift of the laser frequency. The relation between
the labframe νrest frequency and the frequency

This allows a fast scanning of the hyperﬁne struc-
ture by changing the acceleration voltage. In Fig-
ure 4 we show the electrical diagram of the wiring
that enables this voltage scanning. The data ac-
quisition system (DAQ) can provide a controlled
voltage of up to ±10 V, which is ampliﬁed by a
Kepco ampliﬁer by a factor of 100. This voltage
of ±1 kV (and typical precision of 0.02 V) is then
applied to the secondary windings of an isolating
transformer. The insulating transformer supplies
the 230 V line voltages on the secondary side to
a DC power supply which is then also ﬂoated by
the ±1 kV. Since the biased electrode of the volt-
age scanner is connected to the base of the CEC
and thus to the lower output of the power sup-
ply, both elements are biased to ±1 kV relative
to the beamline ground while a constant voltage
is applied over the heating rods.

Following the CEC is the optical detection re-
gion, which is a copy of the light collection region
used in the COLLAPS setup [15]. The photomul-
tiplier tubes in this detection area are used for
determining the resonant laser frequency through
optical detection of the ﬂuorescence decay from a
stable isotope of the element of interest, prior to
starting β-asymmetry measurements on the less
abundant radioactive species.

In the interaction region, where the optical
pumping takes place, Helmholtz coils provide a
magnetic ﬁeld on the order of 2 mT along the
beamline axis pointing in the beam direction.

sible stray ﬁelds in the environment. The min-
imal length of this interaction region is deter-
mined by the time needed for the pumping pro-
cess. The process of optical pumping can be
modelled through the formation of rate equations
based on the Einstein formalism [16, 17, 10]. By

electric potential when the scanner is set to 1 kV (color online). The other (grounded) beamline elements present in the
simulation are colored gray. The trajectories of the particles are drawn in black.

solving this system of diﬀerential equations, the
degree of nuclear polarization P (Eq. (1)) can
be calculated for any interaction time. The D2
line in Na [1] was used as the case study. Fig-
ure 5(a) shows a the hyperﬁne spectrum gener-
ated with this method, while in (b) the polariza-
tion in the highest peak is calculated as a func-
tion of the laser-atom interaction time (translated
into a beam line length assuming a 50 keV beam).
Based on these calculations, a length of 1.6 m was
selected as a compromise between achievable po-
larization and available space in the ISOLDE hall.
Although the length needed to fully polarize an
ensemble depends on the Einstein A parameter of
the transition, 1.6 m will give a suﬃciently long
interaction time for most strong transitions where
A has a value in the order of 107 − 108 Hz. This
is illustrated in Figure 5(b) for 26,28Na and 35Ar,
the ﬁrst isotopes that have been polarized with
the new set-up.

A series of solenoids and a large electromagnet
are placed after the interaction region, with the
ﬁeld of the solenoids acting along the beam direc-
tion and the electromagnet generating a ﬁeld per-
pendicular to it. The combination of these ﬁelds
adiabatically rotates the atomic spin in the hori-
zontal plane, orienting it in the same direction as
the ﬁeld of the electromagnet. The ﬁeld of the
electromagnet is suﬃciently strong to decouple
the nuclear from the electron spin. The details of
this adiabatic spin rotation and decoupling of the

nuclear spin from the electron spin are discussed
in Section 7. A removable sample holder and β-
detectors are installed inside the electromagnet,
where the polarized ensemble is implanted in a
suitable host material. This β-detection setup has
been used before in β-NMR studies on Mg iso-
topes [14].

A diagnostics box containing a wire scanner and
Faraday cup, as detailed in [13] (supplemented
with a plate to detect atomic beams), is installed
after this region to provide beam diagnostics.

Ion-optical beam transmission simulations were
performed to benchmark the eﬀect that the deﬂec-
tor and voltage scanner have on the shape of the

beam and the transmission that can be expected.

A standard beam of 39K+ with 3 π mm mrad
beam emittance is generated for the simulations,
as reported for the cooler-buncher ISCOOL [18].
The focal point of the beam is, prior to enter-
ing the 5 degree deﬂector, optimized for maximal
transmission using the quadrupole doublet that
is installed in front of it. As the doublet is not
included in the simulations, the focus is set by
changing the size of the beam and the convergence
of the incoming beam by changing the Twiss pa-
rameters [19]. The kinetic energy of the beam is
set to 60 keV, which is the maximal beam energy
that can be delivered by ISOLDE to the low en-
ergy section. For all simulations, the COMSOL
multiphysics software was used [20]. The used ge-
ometry is given in Figure 6. First an overview of
all the elements included in the simulations will
be given.

The ﬁrst electrostatic element of the VITO
beamline in the simulations is the 5 degree deﬂec-
tor, which allows a soft bending of the ion beam
to overlap it collinearly with the laser light. The
5 degree deﬂector has an internal opening of 40
mm and consists of two vertical steerer plates and
a pair of electrodes with a machined curve match-
ing 2 m (see Figure 7). After this, a voltage scan-
ner (the design of which will be treated further in
this section) adjusts the kinetic energy of the ion
beam in a range of ±1 keV. It is mounted inside
the vacuum box where the CEC is also mounted
(shaped electrodes and red circle respectively, Fig-
ure 6) and the biased electrode is connected to the
CEC. The CEC acts as a long collimator with a 2
cm opening, followed by another collimator with
an opening of 1 cm approximately 2 m further
downstream. These small collimators guarantee a
good overlap between the particle and laser beam.

charged particles, the CEC is the ﬁnal electro-
static element considered in the simulations. The
tubes and chambers forming the beamline up to
this point are also present and are grounded to
provide accurate potential ﬁelds.

The design for the voltage scanner deviates
from a traditional series of ring electrodes con-
nected through a resistor chain [17]. Instead, two
specially shaped electrodes deﬁne the equipoten-
tial electrical ﬁeld (Figure 8a). Two conﬁgura-
tions of this geometrical design of the shaped elec-
trodes have been used.

In the ﬁrst conﬁguration (Conﬁg. 1 in Fig-
ure 8a), eight triangular spikes are attached to
an octagonal mounting base. Overlapping two of
such electrodes gives a gradual and nearly-linear
change in potential experienced by the ions, as
given in Figure 8b. In the second design (Conﬁg.
2 in Figure 8a), the ﬁrst electrode is replaced with
a cylinder covering the entire scanner, separated
from the biased electrode with a teﬂon insulator.
The central beam axis is thus better encapsulated,
resulting in a more sigmoidal variation of the elec-
tric potential (Figure 8c). To emulate mechani-
cal imperfections related to the construction, the
grounding electrode was rotated 0.5◦ relative to
the z-axis as deﬁned in Figure 6. This rotation is
present in all simulations for both conﬁgurations.
The transmission of the beam through the
beam line as a function of scanning voltage has
been simulated for the two diﬀerent designs of
the voltage scanner (Figure 9a). A second set
of simulations were performed with a slightly de-
tuned 5 degree deﬂector (Figure 9b). Both de-
signs have been constructed and used in experi-
ments, such that the transmission simulations can
be compared to actual data (Figure 9c).

The transmission data for the ﬁrst conﬁgura-
tion was gathered in the commissioning experi-
ment [1] and were the total β-counts from a 26Na
beam measured as a function of scanning volt-
age. During an experiment on β-NMR in liquid
samples performed in May 2018 [4], the second
conﬁguration was used for the ﬁrst time and the
data was gathered in the same way.

The simulations (top 2 panels of Figure 9) and

Figure 9: Transmission eﬃciency through the beamline,
simulated for both conﬁgurations of the scanning elec-
trodes, as a function of voltage applied to the scanner and
for two diﬀerent voltages on the deﬂector. When the op-
timal voltage is applied to the 5 degree deﬂector (1045 V,
top plot), the beam is centered on the axis of the biased
electrode, while a slightly oﬀset voltage (1050 V, middle
plot) results in slightly lower transmission since the axes of
the beam and the electrode no longer coincide. The exper-
imental transmission (bottom plot) agrees with the general
trend predicted by the simulations. The staggering in the
data is due to the structure of the proton supercycle.

the online data (bottom panel of Figure 9) show
a very good agreement. The oscillation in the
counts is due to the proton supercycle. In both
the measurements and the simulations, the ﬁrst
conﬁguration has a severe beamsteering eﬀect, re-
ducing the transmission eﬃciency as a function of
scanning voltage. The second conﬁguration has
no such eﬀect, owing to the better encapsulation
of the beam axis. The simulations with a detuned
5 degree deﬂector show that this can result in
a slight slope for the second conﬁguration and a
shift in the peak location for the ﬁrst. These fea-
tures are also present in the data, suggesting an

5. Design of magnetic ﬁelds

The magnetic ﬁeld generated in the beamline
is separated in three separate sections (see Fig-
ure 2), each with their own requirements:

1. the interaction region (labelled 1 and 2 in

Figure 2).

2. the transitional ﬁeld region (labelled 3).
3. the main magnet region.

The interaction region has to provide a weak, uni-
form magnetic ﬁeld over the entire beam path that
needs to compensate for stray ﬁelds in order to
maintain the laser-induced atomic spin polariza-
tion. The ﬁeld should be small enough however,
not to induce a large splitting of the magnetic sub-
states of the hyperﬁne levels. A magnetic ﬁeld of
approximately 2 mT fulﬁlls both requirements.

Once the radioactive beam is implanted, the
magnetic ﬁeld has to be strong enough to decouple
the nuclear spin from random interactions with
potential (defect-associated) electric ﬁeld gradi-
ents in the crystal. The installed electromagnet
can generate a ﬁeld of up to 0.7 T. This value de-
pends on both the current supplied to the magnet
as well as the distance between the magnet poles,
which can be varied. With a maximal pole dis-
tance of 8 cm, diﬀerent setups for holding samples
and placing detectors can be accommodated.

Since the ﬁeld generated by the electromagnet
is perpendicular to the beamline axis (which is
also the atomic spin orientation axis), the transi-
tional ﬁeld region has to be tuned to provide adi-
abatic rotation of the oriented atomic spins. The
ﬁeld previously designed for the β-NMR setup at
COLLAPS (see Ref. [21]) was used as the model
ﬁeld.

For the design of the magnetic ﬁeld of both
the interaction and the transitional region, sim-
ulations were made in COMSOL. As a design
choice, 4 octagonal coils arranged in a Helmholtz
conﬁguration are used for the interaction region
(see Figure 2). Due to geometrical concerns, a
solenoid with 11.25 cm radius extends the inter-
action region. Several smaller solenoids directly

and measurements (markers) of the magnetic ﬁeld. The
simulation is scaled down by a global factor to account for

to the residual magnetization of the magnet.

wound onto a beampipe continue past this point
and form the transitional ﬁeld. The ﬁnal param-
eters of all solenoids are given in Table 1.

In order to compare the simulated magnetic
ﬁeld proﬁle with reality, magnetic ﬁeld measure-
ments with a 3D Hall probe were made in three
circumstances: the transitional ﬁeld and the main
magnet on (red wide diamonds in Figure 10),
only the main magnet powered (green dots) and
only the transitional ﬁeld powered (blue thin di-
amonds). Due to the unknown conﬁguration in
the main magnet, only the transitional ﬁeld could
be simulated in COMSOL (full line). The good
agreement between simulation and measurements
suggests a good correspondence between the coil
parameters in the simulation and the physical
coils.

6. Multiple-frequency pumping

This can be overcome by using multi-frequency
optical pumping to simultaneously excite more
than one hyperﬁne transitions. The same con-
cept has already been applied at the TRIUMF
facility for the polarization of Li, where EOM’s
were used to induce side-frequencies in the range
of ±30 MHz to the main laser beam frequency
[22].

We have veriﬁed this experimentally, using a
35Ar beam produced by a 1.4 GeV beam onto
a CaO target at ISOLDE. The multi-frequency
pumping was realized by using two acousto-optic
modulators (AOMs), which can each produce a
side band frequency in the required ranges of 300-
400 MHz by applying a ﬁxed RF-frequency to the
crystal inside the AOM. This shifts the frequency
of the incoming laser light by the same value. For
details on the setup of the AOMs, see Ref. [11].

The observed hyperﬁne spectra, using either
one laser frequency for the scanning or by scan-
ning the 3 laser frequencies simultaneously, are
shown in Figure 11. The induced nuclear spin-
polarization is observed by measuring the asym-
metry in the radioactive β-decay after implanta-
tion in a suitable crystal, as outlined before. The
spectra shown in Figure 11 have been recorded by
implanting the polarized 35Ar beam into a NaCl
crystal kept at a temperature of 15(5) K. The sig-
nal height in both spectra is signiﬁcantly diﬀer-
ent, as can be seen clearly in e.g. the 7/2 → 9/2
transition, for which the observed asymmetry in-
creases by almost a factor of 2.

In order to quantify the observed gain in signal

were implemented using the SATLAS Python

factors as given in Table 2 were kept as ﬁxed val-
ues. Both spectra were ﬁt simultaneously with
the same value for the laser power, thus ensuring
the correlations due to shared parameters were
propagated correctly when determining the ratio
of the signal strength.

An excellent agreement is found between the
observed spectra and the calculated β-asymmetry
spectra as a function of the laser frequency, both
for the single and triple laser-atom interaction
systems. This gives conﬁdence in the predictive
power of this simulation package, such that it
can be used in the future to optimize the laser
polarization experiments. From the ﬁtted signal
strengths in both spectra, we ﬁnd an increase of

On the other hand,

In the experimental set-up, the atomic spin-
polarization symmetry axis is along the (laser)
the
beam line.
β-asymmetry measurements, the nuclear spin-
polarization symmetry axis should be along the
direction of the strong holding ﬁeld in which the
implantation crystal is mounted. This ﬁeld is per-
pendicular to the beam line,
in order to allow
for β-detectors to be mounted at 0 and 180 de-
grees with respect to the ﬁeld direction. From
the rate equation calculations of the atomic pop-
ulation, the nuclear spin polarization is extracted
under the assumption that the decoupling ﬁeld
is oriented along the symmetry axis. As we ap-
ply a gradually increasing magnetic ﬁeld in order
to rotate (and decouple) the nuclear and electron
spins adiabatically into the main ﬁeld direction,
changes in the nuclear spin polarization due to
the adiabtic rotation process are possible. To this
end, simulations of this adiabatic spin rotation
have been performed. The magnetic ﬁeld pro-
ﬁle in the 3 directions has been measured and
used in these simulations, for which the total ﬁeld
strength along the beam line was shown in Fig-
ure 10.

from the interaction Hamiltonian including the
hyperﬁne interaction and the two Zeemann in-
teractions with (cid:126)I and (cid:126)J, were performed with
QuTiP [26]. The state vector is initialized in
the atomic groundstate with populations in the
(cid:126)F and mF states as given by the rate equations
after the optical pumping process. The interac-
tion strength of the magnetic ﬁeld in the three
directions is made time-dependent, representing
the changing magnetic ﬁeld as the particle beam
travels through the setup at a certain speed. The
spin dynamics are then calculated by solving the
Schr¨odinger equation. Experimental values for
nuclear parameters in these equations were taken
from Refs. [27] and [24]. The calculated ﬂight
time for the beam from the start of the transi-
tional magnetic ﬁeld to the implantation host is
extended to also include a period where the beam
is stopped in the host. The ﬁrst period (the dy-
namic ﬁeld region) is 2/3 of the total time solved
for, while the implanted period (the static ﬁeld
region) accounts for 1/3 of the time. More details
of the calculation can be found in Ref. [11].

absolute number is too high.

Simulations have also been made for the adi-
abatic rotation of 35Ar (top panel of Figure 12),
which shows no loss in nuclear spin polarization
from the rotation process.

8. Conclusion

To answer the demand for accessible spin-
polarized radioactive nuclei, the VITO beamline
was built as a dedicated setup. It is an adaptable
beamline that delivers highly polarized nuclei to
a central detection point.

Multi-frequency pumping has been established
as a viable technique to increase the asymmetry
signal that can be expected from the radioactive
species. Tests on 35Ar show that the increase and
spectrum can be reproduced by the rate equation
model.

The series of magnetic ﬁelds provide an eﬃcient
adiabatic rotation and decoupling of the nuclear
spin. Rotation calculations agree with the ob-
served asymmetry ratios. The rotation calcula-
tions can be repeated for diﬀerent species pro-
vided the necessary nuclear parameters are avail-
able.
