Abstract: The phase diagram of the strongly interacting matter is the main research subject for different
current and future experiments in high-energy physics. System size and energy scan programs aim to
find a possible critical point. One of such programs was accomplished by the fixed-target NA61/SHINE
experiment in 2018. It includes six beam energies and six colliding systems: p + p, Be + Be, Ar + Sc, Xe + La,
Pb + Pb and p + Pb. In this study, we discuss how the efficiency of centrality selection by forward spectators
influences multiplicity and fluctuation measures and how this influence depends on the size of colliding
systems. We use SHIELD and EPOS Monte-Carlo (MC) generators along with the wounded nucleon model,
introduce a probability to lose a forward spectator and spectator energy loss. We show that for light colliding
systems such as Be or Li even a small inefficiency in centrality selection has a dramatic impact on multiplicity
scaled variance. Conversely, heavy systems such as Ar + Sc are much less prone to the effect.

1. Introduction

Fluctuation measures are considered to be an important tool in the search of the possible critical point
of the strongly interacting matter. However, ﬂuctuation quantities are sensitive to various effects along
with the critical behavior [1–4] such as volume ﬂuctuations [5,6], resonance decays [7], beam and target
material impurities [8] and detector inefﬁciencies.

Experiments in relativistic heavy ion collisions use different techniques to reduce volume ﬂuctuations
by selecting centrality classes. The procedure aims to select events with a restricted number of particle
production sources or volume. The centrality selection may be accomplished by measuring produced
particle multiplicity in a speciﬁc rapidity interval along with energy of non-interacted nucleons-spectators
by forward hadronic calorimeters. Although the multiplicity based approach introduces, a bias on any
ﬂuctuations due to correlations between multiplicities even in different acceptance windows. However,
it is worth noting that this bias can be well reproduced and estimated by using MC generators.

Contrary to this, a solely spectators based centrality selection provides an unbiased method to restrict
the collision volume. Technically, it can be accomplished only in ﬁxed target experiments, as it is possible
there to place a hadronic calorimeter exactly at the beam line. Nevertheless, such calorimeters suffer from
hadronic shower energy leakages from the surface and have much lower resolution capabilities compared
to multiplicity detectors. In this paper, we study an inﬂuence of the energy leakage from the calorimeter
back surface on the average multiplicities and the multiplicity scaled variance and its dependency on the
colliding system size.

2. Study with a Geant Calorimeter Model

The main motivation for this work was a study of how Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD) [9]
inﬂuences the measured quantities in the NA61/SHINE collaboration [10]. PSD is a segmented modular
hadronic calorimeter, which is used for triggering, centrality and event plane determination. The detector
consists of 44 independent modules and each of them has 60 lead (16 mm) + scintillator (4 mm) layers.
The total length of PSD is about 1.2 m, which corresponds to approximately 5.6 interaction lengths.
A scheme of the NA61/SHINE setup and a photo of PSD are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A scheme of the NA61/SHINE experiment [10] and a front view photo of the Projectile Hadronic
Calorimeter. PSD is used for triggering, centrality and event plane determination.

Signals from 60 scintillators in each module are grouped by six, therefore, the design of PSD allows
collecting information from ten independent areas along the beam axis inside the calorimeter. This makes it
possible to study dependencies of different quantities on the calorimeter lengths by selecting centrality by
a reduced number of scintillator groups. It is expected that any centrality sensitive measure will saturate
at one point with an increase of calorimeter length (see Figure 2). On such plot, the 0 limit corresponds to
0 centrality detector efﬁciency, an absence of centrality selection and to minimum bias events. The right
limit is an absence of any energy leakage from the hadronic calorimeter backside.

calorimeter length.

Two MC datasets were generated with the GEANT4 [11] PSD simulation for studying the energy
leakage inﬂuence on different systems: 100,000 events of 150A GeV/c 7Li + 9Be SHIELD MC [12] and
40,000 events of 150A GeV/c 40Ar + 45Sc EPOS 1.99 MC [13]. 7Li was chosen instead of experimentally
used 7Be as the ﬁrst one is stable and can be simulated by SHIELD MC. It was possible to compare two
completely different MC generators as the studied effect was purely detector based. Moreover, it does
not depend on the spectator transverse characteristics as we studied longitudinal shower propagation
that is insensitive to a hit position. In each dataset, we selected centrality on the different length of the
detector from ≈1.1 to 5.6 interaction lengths. The results for average multiplicities, multiplicity ratios and
ﬂuctuation quantities are presented in Figure 3 for 7Li + 9Be and for 40Ar + 45Sc collisions.

Two main conclusions may be drawn from the results:

•

The 5.6 interaction lengths were not enough to eliminate the inﬂuence of backside energy leakage
in light colliding systems (7Li + 9Be) on volume ﬂuctuations as the dependencies did not saturate.
The middle size systems as 40Ar + 45Sc were much less prone to the effect. However, Ar + Sc data are
more sensitive to energy leakage in case of a short calorimeter.

• Mean multiplicities, scaled variance ω[h] = (<h2> − <h>2)/<h> and strongly intensive ∆[Pt,h] [14]
were sensitive to the effect, while mean multiplicity ratios and another strongly intensive
quantity Σ[Pt,h] showed steady behavior. The instability of ∆[Pt,h] contradicted the presumption
that such quantities do not depend on the volume ﬂuctuations. Therefore, it was clear that
assumptions which lead to the construction of the strongly intensive measure ∆[Pt,h] [14] are not
fulﬁlled even in MC generators. Investigation of other measures sensitivities transcends the scope of
this work.

3. Study within a Wounded Nucleon Model

A simple wounded nucleon model (WNM) was created to understand the unexpected sensitivity of
light systems to the energy leak. Three different colliding systems were considered: 7Li + 9Be, 35Cl + 40Ca
and 208Pb + 208Pb with 150 A GeV/c beam momentum (
SNN ≈ 17A GeV). Nucleon density proﬁles were
taken from [16]. Nucleon core effect was not taken into account. Alpha clustering was not implemented
as the goal of the study was to check how the sensitivity to the energy leakage depends on the number
of nucleons in colliding systems. Inelastic nucleon–nucleon cross-section was taken equal to 31.75 mb.
Multiplicity was introduced based on the number of wounded nucleons; in other words, each wounded
nucleon produced a random number of charged particles, which were distributed according to a Poisson
with < Nch >= 3.5.

√

In the ﬁrst version of the model, we introduce dcentrality selection based on the number of forward
nucleon-spectators and a probability to lose each of them p. Distributions of forward nucleon spectators
for p = 0% and 10% are shown in Figure 4.

The 10% of events with a lower number of detected forward nucleons spectators were selected as the
most central ones. If the boundary between classes di not coincide with the boundary between integer
numbers of forward spectators N, then a fraction of events with N + 1 forward spectators was taken to
obtain exactly 10% of the whole data sample.

The dependencies of average event multiplicity and multiplicity scaled variance ω[N] versus
in the
the probability to lose a forward spectator showed a striking difference (Figure 5)
sensitivity to detector efﬁciency between light system and heavy one (7Li + 9Be and 208Pb + 208Pb).
<N> and ω[N] in Beryllium collisions became sensitive to the spectators lost already, then p ≈ 3–4%
contrary to Pb + Pb collisions where <N> and ω[N] were steady to the effect until p ≈ 70% and 30%
respectively (see Figure 6).

Unexpectedly, this simple model reproduced two important features: higher sensitivity of light
systems for small energy loss and lower sensitivity for large fraction energy loss. Nevertheless, we are
aware of the fact that the probability to lose a spectator is not a realistic model of a hadronic calorimeter.
The next step was to introduce a realistic energy losd. For this goal a two-times longer (≈11.2 interaction
length) GEANT4 model of PSD was used and a response on a 150 GeV/c proton beam was generated.
We calculated and ﬁtted a distribution of ratio between deposited by a proton energy in the ﬁrst seven
sections (≈3.9 int.l.) to the whole calorimeter (20 sections), as shown in Figure 7. We used the obtained
function to introduce a random energy loss of each forward spectator in the wounded nucleon model.

calorimeter PSD (11.2 nuclear int. lengths) in the GEANT4 simulation. The whole calorimeter model has
20 sections. This distribution shows the fraction of a proton energy leak from a calorimeter, which has
3.9 nucl. int. lengths or seven sections in case of PSD.

The 10% of the most central events were selected by the spectator deposited energy (see Figure 8).
<N> and ω[N] were calculated and compared with the ideal case (without energy loses). The results are

As shown, the effect is very tiny but nevertheless the lighter the system is the more sensitive it is.
The size of the difference is probably a result of an absence of the energy resolution due to the calorimeter
sandwich structure, as present in the GEANT4 simulation.

4. Conclusions

It was observed that the light nuclei systems as Li + Be are more sensitive to the energy leakage
from the back side of hadronic calorimeters used for centrality determination in ﬁxed target experiments
compared to intermediate size systems as Ar + Sc. The probable reason is that in the light systems most
of the forward energy is concentrated only in a few nucleons. Therefore, a single nucleon loss produces
much bigger volume ﬂuctuations than in a collision of heavy systems, which have a presence of more or
less constant energy leakage in each collision. Nevertheless, more investigations are needed to reach the
complete understanding of the phenomenon. Even though we succeeded in demonstrating the sensitivity
of light systems in the framework of the wounded nucleon model with the probability of a spectator loss,
the realistic energy loss simulation in the same model shows only a tiny effect on average multiplicity and
scaled variance.

The future ﬁxed target programs, which aim to study light nuclei colliding systems, have to pay
attention that a longer calorimeter is needed to control the volume ﬂuctuations for such reactions than for
heavier ones.
