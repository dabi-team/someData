Abstract

We show that the conditional shape invariance symmetry can be used as a very powerful tool to calculate the eigenvalues
of the mixed potential V (r) = ar + br2 + c
for a restricted set of potential parameters. The energy for any
state can be obtained algebraically, albeit for a severely restricted set of potential parameters. We also indicate that
each member of the hierarchy of Hamiltonians is basically conditionally translational shape invariant. Comparison
of analytically obtained results with numerical results is also presented. Our present methodology can be taken as
an alternative treatment for the calculation of any higher order excited states of conditionally exactly solvable (CES)
potentials.

1. Introduction

The connection between solvable potentials and super-
symmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) is an estab-
lished fact [1, 2]. Gendenshtein showed that whenever the
special symmetry known as ‘shape-invariance symmetry’ is
satisﬁed by the supersymmteric partner potentials V1 and
V2, the entire energy spectrum including eigenfunctions
of the Hamiltonian can be calculated by purely algebraic
means [3]. This idea has been illustrated for the full set of
exactly solvable potentials [5]. However, rather more in-
teresting scenario is the existence of conditionally exactly
solvable(CES) and quasi conditionally exactly solvable po-
tentials (QCES). In the ﬁrst case (CES), the full energy
spectrum can be obtained only when the parameters of the
potential satisfy some particular condition. Whereas for
the second case (QCES), a part of the eigen spectrum can
be calculated only when a certain parametric condition is
satisﬁed. Some of these potentials which belong to the
second class are Coulomb potential perturbed by terms of
diﬀerent powers of r [6, 7, 8], anharmonic potential with
quartic and sextic terms [9, 10] and the mixed potential
[11] which is the potential of our present study.
In all
these cases it has been demonstrated that the potential
parameters can be chosen appropriately, such that exact
analytic solution for the ground state of the potential can
be obtained.
In the present work, we revisit the mixed potential to es-
tablish the fact that a proper use of the conditional shape
invariance symmetry is a very powerful tool to calculate
analytically the whole eigen spectrum of the mixed poten-

tial. A number of investigations on this potential can be
found in references [12, 13], although none of them either
established that the conditional shape invariance symme-
try is responsible for occurrence of conditionally exact so-
lution or calculated the whole spectrum. These earlier
works have also not addressed the major issue of exploit-
ing conditional shape invariance symmetry to get solution
of higher excited states. Thus our present work will ad-
dress two key features. First, we will explicitly show that
this particular potential, which is a member of the CES
potential family, basically inherits the conditional shape
invariance symmetry. Second, we will utilize the CES sym-
metry in the hierarchy of Hamiltonians which leads to the
very accurate results even for the excited states for judi-
cious choices of potential parameters.
It is to be noted that numerical calculations of excited
states for a given potential are more challenging, as they
involve larger numerical errors due to the fact that the
system becomes more extended as the excitation increases.
Thus our present methodology has the potential to be pre-
sented as an accurate alternative treatment for the calcula-
tion of higher excited states of CES potentials. For higher
excited states of a given mixed potential, we will always
look for the solution of the ground state of the next higher
member in the hierarchy of Hamiltonians. We will also
show that the choice of parameters also plays a major role
to get an accurate solution. We have compared our ana-
lytic results with the numerical solution of the Schr¨odinger
equation and discussed both the demerits and eﬃcacy of
our methodology.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Sec 2.1 we present
a brief introduction to the SUSY QM language for general
readers. In Sec 2.2 and Sec 2.3 we discuss the mixed po-
tential extensively. In Sec 3 we present the comparison of
numerical results with analytically calculated results. Sec
4 contains a summary followed by concluding remarks.

2. Methodology

2.1. SUSY QM and shape-invariance

To discuss the basics of SUSY formalism, we start with
the SUSY Hamiltonian in one dimension, which is given
H1
by H = (cid:16)
0 H2 (cid:17) where the original Hamiltonian H
is factorized in two partner Hamiltonian H1 and H2. H1
and H2 are deﬁned as

0

H1,2 =

d2
dx2 + V1,2(x),

−

(1)

where the original potential V (x) is also factorized in two
supersymmetric partner potentials V1,2(x). The partner
potentials V1,2(x) are represented through the well-known
Riccati equation

V1,2 = W 2

W ′(x),

∓

(2)

where W (x) is referred as the superpotential and is related
to the ground state wave function Ψ0(x) of H1 through

W (x) =

Ψ′0(x)
Ψ0(x)

.

−

(3)

~
It is to be noted that energy levels (in the units of
√2m ) are
shifted to make the ground state energy of H1 zero. Now
in terms of generalized annihilation and creation operator
A and A†, which are deﬁned as

A =

d
dx

+ W (x), A† =

d
dx

−

+ W (x),

the two partner Hamiltonians can be written as

H1 = A†A, H2 = AA†.

(4)

(5)

Using SUSY algebra, one can explicitly show the corre-
spondence between energy levels of the two partner Hamil-
tonians. Let the eigenfunctions of H1,2, which correspond
to eigenvalues E(1,2)

be Ψ(1,2)
n

. Then

n

H2(AΨ(1)

n ) = AA†(AΨ(1)

n ) = AH1Ψ(1)
n
n (AΨ(1)
= E(1)

n ).

Similarly

H1(A†Ψ(2)

n ) = A†A(A†Ψ(2)

n ) = A†H2Ψ(2)
n
n (A†Ψ(2)
= E(2)

n ).

Since AΨ(1)

0 = 0, ground state of V1(x) does not have a
SUSY partner. So the pair of potential V1,2(x) have the
same eigenspectra, only the partner state corresponding
to the ground state of V1(x) is missing in the spectrum of
n , E(1)
V2(x). Thus, E(1)
Gendenshtein pointed out that the shape-invariance con-
dition is mathematically expressed [3] as

n+1 = E(2)

0 = 0.

V2(x, a1) = V1(x, a2) + R(a1),

a2 = f (a1)

(8)

where a1 and a2 are the two parameters appearing in the
potential and f is a prescription for getting a2 from a1 . To
be similar in shape, the partner potentials must have same
mathematical structure, but with altered parameters. It
has been shown that this condition is an integrability con-
dition [4] and applying SUSY algebra for a hierarchy of
Hamiltonians along with this shape invariance condition,
one obtains the full eigen-spectrum of H1 as

E(1)

n =

n

X
k=1

R(ak).

(9)

We will show that for CES potentials, the shape invariance
criterion is satisﬁed only when a set of constraint condi-
tions involving potential parameters is satisﬁed.

2.2. Conditionally exact solution of mixed potential

Algebraic method of solving a shape invariant poten-
tial by forming a hierarchy of Hamiltonians is well known
and extensively used [5]. Here, we are going to show its
eﬀective use in case of a CES potential also. The form of
the potential of our present interest is

V (r) = ar + br2 +

c
r

+

l(l + 1)
r2

,

b > 0.

(10)

So to calculate the ground state, we take

V1(a, b, c, l, r) = V (r)

E0,

−

(11)

where E0 is the ground state energy of V (r). Here by fol-
lowing the conventional formalism of SUSY we have sub-
tracted E0 to make the ground state energy of V1(r) zero
and the Riccati equation is deﬁned accordingly. We choose
our superpotential ansatz as

W (r) = Ar

B
r

−

+ D, B > 0, A > 0.

(12)

Now, V1(r) is related with W (r) through the Riccati equa-
tion as

V1(a, b, c, l, r) = V (r)

−

(6)

= ar + br2 +

where

E0 = W 2(r)

Comparing the coeﬃcients of each power of r from eq. (13)
and eq. (14), the unknown parameters are calculated and
we also get a constraint condition as number of potential
parameters are larger than the numbers of superpotential
parameters. The unknown parameters A, B, D of the su-
perpotential are related with potential parameters through
the following equations

B2

B = l(l + 1),
A2 = b,
2BD = c,
2AD = a,

The solutions of the above equations are

A = √b,

D =

Then the ground state energy of V (r) is given by

E0 =

subject to the parametric constraint condition

l(l + 1) =

c2b

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

It is evident from the above discussion that not all the po-
tential parameters can be chosen freely as the constraint
condition regarding potential parameters has to be satis-
ﬁed. Now, a feature of conditional shape invariant poten-
tial is that the number of potential parameters are gener-
ally larger than the number of superpotential parameters.
So there is a constraint condition relating potential param-
eters (eq. 18). We have chosen l, b, c as free parameters
and then a is calculated from the constraint condition and
calculated values of a are presented in Table 2 for diﬀerent
sets of potential parameters.
Now to check the shape invariance property of V1(r) we
construct the SUSY partner potential V2(r) as

V2(a, b, c, l1, r) = W 2(r) + W ′(r)
2BD
r
2AB + A

B2 + B

−
+ A2r2 + D2

=

+ 2ADr

= ar + br2 +

−
c
r

+

l1(l1 + 1)
r2

+ R.

From the structure of eq. (20), it can be shown that the
new parameter (l1) is related with the old parameter (l)
by translation as

l1(l1 + 1) = B2 + B

=

c2b
a2 −

c√b
a

= l(l + 1)

c√b
a
= (l + 1)(l + 2),

−

2

(21)

Thus l is translated to l + 1 during the passage of V1(r)
V2(r) and R is determined through the relation

→

R = D2

−

2AB + A.

(22)

Next, we carry forward this technique to the calculation
of excited states of V (r). As V1(r) and V2(r) are the two
partner potentials, they maintain the energy degeneracy
relation and ground state of V2(r) is nothing but the ﬁrst
excited states of V1(r). Now to calculate the ground state
of V2(r), we start from V2(r) as the new starting potential
and deﬁne V ′(r) = V2(r). If E′0 is the ground state energy
of V ′(r), we shift the energy scale again by E′0, so that its
ground state is at zero energy

V ′1 (r) = V ′(r)

E′0.

−

(23)

We start with a similar anstaz for the superpotential of
V ′(r) as

ˆW (r) = A′r

B′
r

−

+ D′, B′ > 0, A′ > 0

(24)

Repeating the same procedure as before, we ﬁnd that the
superpotential parameters (A′, B′, D′) have similar rela-
tionships with parameters of the corresponding potential,
as in the previous case. Note that we have chosen l, b, c as
independent parameters and a is calculated through the
constraint condition. As during the passage of calculating
ﬁrst member in the hierarchy to the next one l is trans-
lated to l + 1, so the calculated value of a will be diﬀerent
from it’s previous value. We call it a1. Thus A′, B′, D′ are
now related with a1, b, c by

A′ = √b = A,

D′ =

a1
2√b

,

B′ =

√bc
a1

.

−

(19)

(25)

So the constraint condition for ground state is given by

Again the functional relation between parameters of V2(r)
and W (r) can be calculated by comparing the coeﬃcients
of diﬀerent powers of r. The calculation reveals that b, c
and a remain same as their functional dependences with
respective superpotential parameters remain unchanged,
although l has been changed to l1 while l1 is determined
by

l1(l1 + 1) = B2 + B.

(20)

3

l1(l1 + 1) =

c2b
a2
1

+

c√b
a1

(26)

where l1 = l + 1. Then the ground state energy of V ′(r) is

E′0 =

We have calculated the ground state of V ′(r) which is ac-
tually the ﬁrst excited state of V1(r). Now as ground state
energy of V1(r) has been made zero by shifting energy
scale, so the calculated ground state energy of V ′(r) have
to be properly shifted by adding the ground state energy of
V (r). Therefore, in proper energy scale, the ground state
energy of V ′(r) is

EV ′

0 = E′0 + E0 =

a2

4b −

2bc

−

+ 3√b.

(28)

Thus from the above discussion, we claim that the given
mixed potential is shape invariant but this shape invari-
ance criterion holds only when the potential parameters
satisfy a particular constraint condition. So we designate
it as conditional shape invariance symmetry. However it is
desired to see the equivalent relation through the Riccati
equation which is represented as

W 2(r; A, B, D) +

dW (r; A, B, D)
dr

= W 2(r; A′, B′, D′)

d(W (r; A′, B′, D′)
dr

−

+ R.

(29)

For the traditional exactly shape invariant potential, R
is exactly the ground state energy as one-to-one corre-
spondence between the potential parameters and those
of superpotential parameters holds good. However direct
satisfaction through the algebraic relation as given by eq.
(29) is not possible as our potential is conditionally shape
invariant and there is no clear one-to-one correspondence
between potential parameters and superpotential parame-
ters. Because of the presence of constraint condition, one
parameter is always dependent on the particular choice
of potential. Nonetheless, if the left side of the eq. (29)
(19) together with the value
is calculated by using eq.
of A, B, D from eq. (16) and right side of the eq. (29)
(14) together with the value
is calculated by using eq.
of A′, B′, D′ from eq.
(22), then
(29) is exactly
the algebraic relation presented by eq.
satisﬁed. One can easily verify it by putting the value of
b, c, l and a taken from Table 2 from the presented value
of potential parameters in section 3.

(25) and R from eq.

Now following the same procedure we can construct
the partner of V ′ (say V ′′) and partner of V ′′ (say V ′′′)
and partner of V ′′′ (say V ′′′′). Thus V (r), V ′(r), V ′′(r),
V ′′′(r), V ′′′′(r) are basically the members of the hierar-
chy of Hamiltonians which are constructed by basic SUSY
mechanism in each step.
In construction of this hier-
archy we utilise the same form of superpotential with
diﬀerent parameters and relate the potential parameters
with those of corresponding superpotential parameters,
which in turn give us the constraint conditions regard-
ing potential parameters along with the ground state en-
ergies. However, during transition from V (r)
V ′(r),
V ′′′′(r), etc.,
V ′(r)
we notice that a new constraint condition has to be sat-
isﬁed in each step, since the parameter l is translated as

V ′′′(r), V ′′′(r)

V ′′(r), V ′′(r)

(l + 2)

(l + 4), etc. respec-

tively. We observe that the pair of partner potentials (V1,
V ′);(V ′, V ′′);(V ′′, V ′′′);(V ′′′, V ′′′′) are shape invariant but
shape invariance is satisﬁed only when potential parame-
ters satisfy the particular constraint condition. Thus the
ﬁrst and preliminary ﬁnding of our investigation is that the
mixed potential is conditionally exactly solvable because
it satisﬁes shape invariance subjected to a particular con-
straint condition involving potential parameters.
The second motivation of our present work is to extend the
concept of conditional shape invariance for excited states.
Here we take the opportunity to extend our calculation to
the excited states of stationary Hamiltonian and to see how
accurately that can be calculated with the ground state of
diﬀerent members of the hierarchy. For truly shape in-
variant potentials this is a trivial task as the ground state
of nth member of the hierarchy basically corresponds to
(n
1)th excited state of the original Hamiltonian. But
in case of mixed potential, due to additional conditional
shape invariance criterion this is no more a trivial task.
Together with this, as all of the potential parameters are
not freely chosen, the accuracy of SUSY result will highly
depend on the choice of parameters.
In the following section we try to exhibit the degeneracy
property of members of the hierarchy of potentials and
show that

2.3. General form of energy and constraint condition

In this section we derive a general formula for calculation
of the parameter a, as well as the energy of any excited
state in terms of independent parameters c, b and l. For
the ﬁrst excited state if we write the constraint condition
as a quadratic equation in a (renaming as a1), then

l1(l1 + 1)a2

Solving this equation, we get two solutions for a1

l1 = l + 1

(35)

(36)

The second solution for a1 has been chosen. It is evident
from the construction of hierarchy of Hamiltonians that for
diﬀerent members of the hierarchy, constraint conditions
are also diﬀerent, as parameters are translated. Of the
two possible solutions for a1, only a(
is parametrically

l+1 for
the ground state. So we have chosen the second solution
as only this solution incorporates the translational change

−

)

of l. As b and c are independent parameters, they are
constants for all Vn(r). Let for Vk(r), a = ak, l = lk.
Then for Vk+1(r) we have a1 = ak+1 and lk+1 = lk + 1.
Generalizing eq. (34), we obtain the exression of ak for
any higher order excited state, which is given by

ak =

c√b
lk + 2

,

−

k = 1, 2, 3..

(37)

where l1 = l. Now in terms of ground state angular mo-
mentum l, ak can be written as

ak =

c√b
l + k + 1

,

−

k = 0, 1, 2, 3..

(38)

It is to be noted that from eq. (38), the parameter a can
be calculated for the ground state as well as for any excited
state.
Hence the ground state energy in terms of independent
parameters is

E0 =

−

c2

4(l + 1)2 + 2√b(l + 1) + √b.

(39)

Now the ground state energy of V2(r) in properly shifted
scale, which is the ﬁrst excited state energy of V (r), is
given by

EV2

0 = E′0 + E0
c2

=

−

4(l1 + 1)2 + 2√b(l1 + 1) + 3√b.
Generalizing, ground state energy of Vk(r), which is the
(k

1)th excited state of V (r), is

(40)

−

Ek =

−

c2

4(l + k + 1)2 +2√b(l+1)+(4k+1)√b,

k = 0, 1, 2, ..

(41)
As the expression is written in terms of independent pa-
rameters b, c, which are constants, any excited state energy
of V (r) can be easily calculated. So all the excited states
of Vk(r) can be obtained exactly and analytically, provided
ak satisﬁes the constraint condition which highlights the
fact that in this case exact solution is a manifestation of
conditionally shape invariance symmetry.

very close agreement between SUSY and RKGS for the

ber of excited states. From Table 2, it is quite easy to
see that the calculated values of the dependent parameter
a obtained from the translational but conditional shape
invariance during the passage of each member of the hi-
erarchy does not change signiﬁcantly for the ﬁrst choice.

However in the second choice the change in a is noticeable.
So in the second case the eﬀect of change in a for diﬀernt

the four members basically overlap and it is very hard to
distinguish them. Although a is calculated from constraint
condition in each step, the variation in a is insigniﬁcant as
value of a is very small.
But for the second choice, the change in calculated values
of a is signiﬁcant. During passage of V

Thus the SUSY values for the excited states of V (r) are
lower than the numerical values. The eﬀect is more signif-
icant for higher order excited states.
One may be curious to know what will be the result for
some other choices of a. For some other choice of a where
the diﬀerence of a is signiﬁcant for any two partner po-
tential, the partner potentials will be more distinct. Also
for such a set of parameters, although the ground state
energy will always be exact, analytically and numerically
calculated energy values may diﬀer signiﬁcantly for the ex-
cited states. It is to be noted that in this paper, our main
motivation is to depict the eﬃcacy of SUSY methodology
and conditional shape invariance symmetry. So we have
deliberately kept those choices where ∆E is very small.

4. Conclusion

In the present manuscript we have discussed the con-
ditional shape invariance symmetry of a mixed potential.
We ﬁrst show that conditional shape invariance is the re-
quired symmetry to have the conditional exact solution of
this potential. Our superpotential ansatz is a very power-
ful technique where no initial input is necessary. Utilizing
the Riccati equation we relate the unknown parameters of
the superpotential in terms of the potential parameters.
Next we develop the hierarchy of Hamiltonians and high-
light the fact that during the passage from one member
to the next of the hierarchy of Hamiltonians the condi-
tional shape invariance symmetry is necessary. Finally in
the second part of our work we have extensively used the
conditional shape invariance property as a very powerful
tool to get the excited states of the original potential for a
restricted set of potential parameters. In each case we look
for the exact algebraic result for the ground state of the
SUSY partners, then SUSY results are further compared
with the numerical solution of Schr¨odinger equation. The
open question in this discussion remains wheather it is
possible to extend our present methodology for the other
choice of CES potentials where more than one constraint
condition has to be satisﬁed. One such potential is the
generalized polynomial potentials [14].
