Energetic  ion  irradiation  usually  decreases  superconducting 
critical temperature(Tc), with the few exceptions involving increases 
up  to  a  few  K  only.  However,  our  recent  2.5×1015  Ar/cm2 
irradiations  by  1.5  MeV  Ar6+  enhanced  Tc  of  the  single  crystal 
Fe-superconductor  Ba(Fe0.943Co0.057)2As2  by  8.2  K  from  its  initial 
onset Tc of ~16.9 K as measured from the real part of the magnetic 
susceptibility,  matching  measurements  from  the  imaginary  part, 
electrical  resistivity  and  magnetization.  Ozaki  et  al.  (2016) 
explained  their  Tc  increase  of  0.5  K  in  FeSe0.5Te0.5  films  with  the 
thickness (t) < the irradiating proton range (R), as due to a nanoscale 
compressive  strain developed  from  radiation  damage  of  the  lattice. 
Here,  Ar  irradiation  with  t  >  R  results  in  an  Ar  implanted  layer  in 
our  crystal.  Implanted  inert  gas  atoms  often  agglomerate  into 
high-pressure  bubbles  to  exert  a  large  compressive  strain  on  the 
lattice.  We  suggest  that  this  additional  compressive  strain  could  be 
the reason for such a large (~49%) Tc increase.

1. Introduction 

Superconductivity  originates  in  BCS-type  metallic  superconductors  in  the  metallic 

environment and in oxide HTSCs (High Temperature Superconductors) in the Cu-O layers. Its 

origin in magnetic layers of Fe-As or Fe-Te/Se in Fe pnictide / chalcogenide superconductors 
or Fe-HTSCs  are  novel,  involving  a  few  exotic  superconducting  states.1-6) More  research  on 

the  mechanism  of  superconductivity  is  still  needed.  On  the  application  side,  these  Fe 

superconductors  have  a good  potential  of  being  fabricated  into  practical  wires  or  cables  for 

high  field  magnets  due  to  fabrication  advantages,  and  58  K  or  higher  Tc  in  a  few

Fe-HTSCs.2,7) Such magnets may be used in radiation environments of accelerators and fusion 

reactors.  Considering  these  application-oriented  aspects,  radiation  effects  in  Fe-HTSCs  are 
being  studied  fairly  widely.8)  To  join  the  radiation  damage  documentation  experiments,  we 

have chosen the well-studied Co-doped iron pnictide of Ba(Fe(1-x)Cox)2As2, with x = 0.057, a 

composition slightly below the optimum doping concentration – but in single crystal form to 

eliminate  grain  boundary  complications.  We  decided  to  work  on  bulk  samples  to avoid  thin 
films that often have special properties. Here, irradiation by heavier ions (Ar6+), specifically 
2.5×1015  Ar-ions/cm2  irradiation  with 1.5 MeV Ar6+ ions,  instead  of  lighter  ions  have  been 

selected, to inject higher damage energy per (lattice) atom (dea) and hence to have more effect 

on the superconducting properties. Our motivation has been to get larger irradiation-induced 

changes  of  Tc  that  get  more  attention,  but  certainly  without  anticipating  any  increase  of  Tc. 

However,  the  choice  of  the  ion  beam  made  the  ion  range  (R)  smaller  than  the  sample 

thickness (t = ~ 200 μm). 

Quite surprisingly, the above-mentioned Ar ion implantation caused Tc to increase and that 

too  by  a  whopping  ~  49%  or  ~  8  K,  confirmed  from  measurements  of  electrical  resistivity, 

magnetization  and  the  real  and  imaginary  components  of  magnetic  susceptibility.  This  is  in 

stark contrast to 52 out of 55 references listed in Table 1 of the review of M. Eisterer reporting 
damage  or  decrease  of  Tc  of  different  Fe-based  superconductors.8) The  reported  increase  at 

best has been 0.5 K in the review. 

In terms of timeline, an invited talk3) in Berlin (2019) followed by an early 2020 talk4) in 

Kolkata have been our preliminary reporting, basically to invite discussions. The present work 

additionally  explores  a  possible  cause  or  causes  of  such  exceptionally  large  increase  of  Tc, 

after  summarizing  present  radiation  modifications  of  electrical  resistance,  magnetic 

susceptibility (χʹ and χʺ) and magnetization (M). As stated in the Abstract, Ozaki et al. showed 

that nanoscale lattice strain induced by radiation damage in their t < R samples is increasing 
Tc in these compressed nano-regions  with the proximity  effect  turning  it into a bulk effect.9) 
Here, we point out tuning of Tc in Ba(Fe(1−x)Cox)2As2 by bulk pressure.10) 

Inert  gas  atoms  are  insoluble  in  solids.  So,  on  implantation  into  a  solid,  these  often 
precipitate  forming  small-sized  high  pressure  (HP)  bubbles  in  the  solid.11-13)    This  topic  has 

been widely studied for decades, particularly for the inner walls of nuclear reactors. The state 

(solid,  liquid  or  gaseous)  of  the  HP  bubbles  in  the  solid  can  be  anticipated  from  the  Ar 
pressure-temperature phase diagram, cited here.13)    Faraci et al. (1991) and Felde et al. (1984) 
could demonstrate the presence of HP solid Ar bubbles.11,12)    The present work proposes, for 

the first time, that such HP bubbles, possible in our t > R case of Ar implantation, exert a large 

 
additional pressure on the Ba(Fe(1−x)Cox)2As2 lattice, concomitantly causing a large additional 

3 

increase of Tc. 

2.  Material and Methods 

Single  crystals  (SXLs)  of  Ba(Fe(1-x)Cox)2As2,  x  =  0.057,  were  grown  by  the  self-flux 

method.2,5) XRD of UR (Un-Radiated) samples in Fig.1 shows only (00l) reflections from the 

large face of our 1.7 – 3 mm (length), 1 – 2 mm (width) and 0.2 – 1 mm (thickness) samples and 

no x-ray detectable second phase. This proves  the  purity  and single crystalline  nature of the 

samples.   

Here,  200  m  thick  SXLs  have been  irradiated  at  the Inter-University  Accelerator  Centre 

(IUAC), New Delhi, India, by a 1.5 MeV Ar6+-beam. The crystals have been characterized first 

in UR and then in AR (After Radiation) condition. All characterizations have been summarized 

in Table I. 

A Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer has been used for the measurement of the real and 

imaginary parts of the magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 2).   

Electrical resistance for (a,b) plane conduction  has been measured (Figs. 3 and 4) using a 

standard DC 4-probe technique under H = 0 & 4 Tesla magnetic fields in a 14 T PPMS system 

from Quantum Design, USA, H being applied along the c axis direction of the sample. For this, 

rectangular-shaped samples have been cut with a wire-saw. Electrical contacts for conduction 

along the ab-plane have been made by attaching thin copper wires with silver epoxy. The larger 

uncertainty  in resistivity value than in normalized  or relative resistivity value is likely due  to 

the  larger  uncertainty  in  the  measurement  of  sample  dimensions  (compared  to  electrical 

measurements). So, Figs.3 and 4 present normalized resistivity vs. temperature (T) data, as is 

often done in the literature.9) 

Figs. 5 and 6 show ZFC (Zero Field Cooled) and FC (Field Cooled) magnetization (M) vs. 

temperature  (T)  in  the  crystals  before  and  after  the  irradiation  as  measured  in  a  Quantum 

Design SQUID magnetometer.

3.   Theoretical Considerations 

Radiation damage test data ideally include, in addition to fluence, Φt, either displacements 

per atom (dpa) or damage energy per atom (dea or DEPA). For comparing different types of 

irradiations,  the  mean  energy,  Ep,av,  transferred  by  any  irradiation  to  an  atom  of  the  target 
lattice, has often been used as a measure of the effective irradiation instead of the fluence.14,15) 

This is the damage energy per atom (dea). This parameter has been successfully utilized in the 
radiation damage investigation of different materials including superconductors.8,14,15) Before 

elaborating  on  the  increase  in  Tc  via  inert  gas  bubble  formation,  details  of  the  higher 

effectiveness (in terms of Ep,av) of the present Ar ion irradiation with respect to the 190 keV 
proton  irradiation  will  be presented.8)  Defects  can  be  generated  by  elastic collisions,  only  if 

the transferred energy exceeds the binding energy, Ed, of the lattice atom (typically a few eV 
in metals and 10 – 40 eV in ionic crystals).8) Maximum Energy transfer in a head-on elastic 
collision is: Tm = T(max) = 4Ml.Mp × Ep / (Ml + Mp)2 for the projectile (ion / neutron) with mass 

(Mp) and energy (Ep) falling on a lattice with atoms of mass Ml. 

For charged particle irradiation with low energy transfer, Ep,av can be calculated considering 

only energy transfers higher than the threshold energy Ed as follows.14,15)

4. Results   

4.1 Results and Discussion 

XRD  showed  a  gradual  decrease  of  the  lattice  parameter  c  due  to  increasing 

Co-substitution: c = 13.031 Å for x = 0.000, c = 12.999 Å for x = 0.057 & 12.988 Å for x = 

0.102.  A  broadening  of  XRD  peaks  indicates  the  generation  of  lattice  defects.  Large 
broadening  for  irradiation  by  the  high  fluence  of  10×1015  Ar-ions/cm2  in  Fig.  1  shows 
significant  lattice  defects.  XRD  after  2.5×1015Ar-ions/cm2 irradiation  shows  no  such  drastic 

damage  of  the  structure.  Results  for  the  magnetic  susceptibility  (Fig.  2),  relative  electrical 

resistivity (Figs. 3 and 4) and ZFC magnetization (Figs. 5 and 6) for the present sample before 

and  after  our  irradiation,  and  similar  literature  data,  along  with  some  energy  transfer 

calculation (see Section 4.3.2) results, have been given in Table I, to help the discussion. As 

expected,  neither  the  real  part  (χʹ),  nor  the  imaginary  part  (χʺ)  of  magnetic  susceptibility 

 
 
 
 
5 

showed (Fig. 2) superconductivity in the x = 0 sample. 

In Fig.  2 and  Table  I, for the  5.7%  Co-doped  Ba(Fe,Co)2As2  sample  (called  2Ba5.7Co in 

UR and AR conditions), our irradiation increases Tc(χʹ), as given by the χʹ step, from 16.9 K to 

25.1  K.  This  implies  an increase  by  8.2  K  in  Tc(χʹ)  due  to  our  Ar-irradiation,  a  case  of  ion 

implantation. From SRIM (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter) calculation, we estimate a 

range (R) of 0.903 μm for a 1.5 MeV Ar beam in our sample. So, a buried Ar-implanted layer 

is expected to be created in our sample. The inset of Fig. 2 shows only one peak in χʺ vs. T 

graph  as  it  should  be  for  a  single  crystal,  while  pellet  or  granular  samples  usually  show 

inter-grain and intra-granular peaks. Here, our irradiation increases Tc(χʺ) from 16.0 K to 24.0 

K, implying an increase of 8 K. There is thus, an agreement between the measurements on the 

imaginary part (χʺ) and the real part (χʹ) of the magnetic susceptibility. 

In addition, the independent measurement of Tc from electrical resistivity also records that 
the 2.5×1015 Ar-ions/cm2 irradiation increases (Figs. 3 and 4) Tc(completion) from 16.0 K to 

23.8 K i.e., by 7.8 K. This is in good agreement with the magnetic results. 

The  application  of  a  magnetic  field  is  seen  to  shift  the  superconducting  transition  for 

unirradiated  as  well  as  irradiated  samples  significantly  towards  lower  temperatures,  as 

expected in superconductors (Figs. 3 and 4). 

It  is  satisfying  that  the  ZFC  magnetization  data  in  Figs.  5  and  6  indicate  an  increase  of 

Tc(onset), matching the resistivity and magnetic susceptibility results. 

4.2 Existing Explanations of Tc Increase by Irradiations 

On  searching  the  literature  for  explanations  of  the  irradiation-induced  Tc  increase  cases 

observed in different superconductors, 4 explanations have been found. 

Explanation  1:  Irradiation-generated  nanoscale  compressive  strain  in  the  lattice  caused 

localized  Tc  increase at different  spots, and  their linkage  by  the proximity  effect resulted in 
2.8% increase of Tc in t < R Fe-superconductor of Ozaki et al., as already discussed.9) 

Explanation 2: Marginal rise of Tc in low-Tc A-15 superconductors (Mo3Ge and Mo3Si) due 

to the irradiation-induced smearing or broadening of the DOS (Density of States) peak in the 
DOS = N(E) vs. E plot is known.16) 

Explanation  3:  For  Ba2Sr2CaCu2O8+x  (Bi-2212),  Tc  vs.  O-content  graph  is  an  inverted 
parabola, and the major effect of radiations like our 55 MeV Li3+ irradiation was removal of 
O-atoms.17)  So,  the  same  55  MeV  Li3+  irradiation  increased  Tc  (by  4.0  K)  in  samples  with 

higher  than  optimum  O-content,  and  decreased  Tc  (by  11.5  K)  in  samples  with  optimized 
O-content.17) 

 
 
6 

Explanation 4: Teknowijoyo et al. proposed that their observed increase of Tc (by ~ 4.54%) 

in  FeSe  due  to  2.5  MeV  electron  irradiation  was  due  to  local  strengthening  of  the  pair 

interaction by irradiation-induced Frenkel defects.8,18) 

One or more of these and/or a new Explanation will be applicable to the present observation 

of  Tc  increase.  Often  irradiation  results  have  been  complex  and  apparently  conflicting. 

Mizukami et al. found that  on 2.5  MeV  electron  irradiation  of  BaFe2(As1-xPx)2,  Tc  increases 

while TN (temperature of antiferromagnetic ordering) decreases for underdoped samples (x = 
0.16 and 0.24).19) Here, Tc was enhanced  (by  ~ 2  K or so  only, as shown in their  Fig.  3(b)), 
only up to the irradiation dose of ~ 3 C/cm2. But Tc is depressed at high dopant concentrations 

(x ≳ 0.28). However, the Eisterer group observed Tc to decrease by irradiation in underdoped 
BaFe2(As0.76P0.24)2 crystals. Unseen factors may have caused this difference.8) 

4.3 Tentative Explanation of the Larger Improvement of Tc by the Present Irradiation 

4.3.1 General 

None  of  the  4  explanations  can  explain  the  above-discussed  ~8  K  increase  of  Tc  in  our 
SXLs  of  Ba(Fe0.943Co0.057)2As2  due  to  2.5×1015  Ar/cm2  irradiation  by  1.5  MeV  Ar6+. 

Compression of the lattice by radiation defects increased Tc by 2.8% in Explanation 1. But the 

unique t > R condition here allows ion implantation and possible agglomeration of Ar to form 
high  pressure  solid  Ar  precipitates  (as  bubbles).11-13)    This  can  exert,  as  discussed  below, 

additional compression of much higher magnitude to account for the much larger Tc increase. 

Table  I  shows  that  the  sample  thickness  (t)  is  larger  than  the  range  (R)  of  the  irradiating 

particle  only  in  our  experiment.  This  is  a  necessary  condition  for  the  formation  of  an 

implantation layer, at a depth R. Ions will fully penetrate the sample and go out in cases where 

t  <  R  (in  Table  I),  resulting  in  no  possibility  of  implantation  and  bubble  formation.  These 

cases  may  show  the  smaller  Tc  increase  only  due  to  lattice-compression  resulting  directly 
from the radiation defects. Such lattice-compression has, in fact, been observed by HRTEM.9)   

Our  experiment  might  have  produced  (i)  lattice-compression  by  the  passage  of  the  particle 

irradiation  as  in  Ozaki  et  al.  work,  and  (ii)  lattice-compression  due  to  the  pressure  of 
high-pressure inert gas bubbles in the implantation layer, with (ii) as the main contribution.9) 

As  a support to  this conjecture of  implanted  Ar-ions  agglomerating  into  high-pressure  Ar 

bubbles  in  our  samples,  let  us  recall  such  experiments  finding  HP  bubbles  in  similar  lattice 

 
 
 
 
7 

systems.11-13)    This  process  should  be  able  to  exert  substantial  pressure  also  in  case  of  the 

Ba(Fe,Co)2As2  lattice.  It  is  well  known  in  the  literature  and  already  discussed  in  the 

Introduction section that high pressure, like chemical doping, can generate superconductivity 
or  enhance  Tc.10)  For  example,  high  pressure  in  a  special  diamond  anvil  cell  generated 

superconductivity  in  SrFe2As2  (giving  maximum  Tc  of  27  K  at  around  4  GPa)  and  also  in 
BaFe2As2 (giving maximum Tc of 29 K at around 4 GPa).23)    The Karlsruhe group showed, in 

their Figs. 2 (a) and (b), 15 K increase of Tc(p) of underdoped (x = 0.041) Ba(Fe(1-x)Cox)2As2 
under  an  applied  hydrostatic  pressure,  p,  of  ~  3.5  Gpa.10)    These  are  recalled  to  stress  that 

pressure effect is capable of causing the large Tc rise that we observe.   

Ozaki et al. referred to an earlier TEM observation of strain fields created in Y-123 single 
crystals by low energy proton and neutron irradiations.9,24,25)    Ozaki et al. further observed, in 

their  own  HRTEM  and  STEM  images,  inwardly  curved  lattice  fringes,  which  indicated  the 

presence  of  a  strain  field  around  the  cascade  defects  in  their  FeSe0.5Te0.5  films  (with 
unirradiated  Tc  of  18  K).These  defects  originated  from  their  190  keV  proton  irradiation.9) 

Internal  compressive  strain,  especially  along 
the  (a,b)-plane  directions,  has  been 
experimentally  found  to  enhance  Tc  in  FST  films,  as  detailed  in  Refs.[16,41-43]  of  Ref.8.8) 
Such situations have been theoretically studied by Bellingeri et al.26,27) For a superconducting 

film  on  a  substrate,  substrate-induced  strain  affects  Tc,  providing  another  example  of  the 
pressure effect.27) 

4.3.2 Damage Energy per Atom (Ep,av) Comparison 

(1) Calculation of Ep,av for Ba(Fe0.943Co0.057)2As2, irradiated by Ar-beam: 

Ep,av = 98.74 eV and Tm = 1.334 MeV have been calculated, taking the values of Zp(Ar) = 18, 

Zl = [(56×1 + 26×1.886+27×0.114+33×2)/5] = 34.8228, Mp(Ar) = 39.962, Ml = [(137.327×1 
+ 55.847×1.886+58.933×0.114+74.992×2)/5] = 79.8714 and Ed = 40 eV. Φt = 2.5×1015 cm-2, 

Ep = 1.5 MeV 

(2) Calculation of Ep,av for FeSe0.5Te0.5, irradiated by proton beam:9) 

Ep,av = 0.0275 eV and Tm = 9.389 keV have been calculated, taking the values of Zp(proton) = 

1, Zl = [(26×1 + 34×0.5+52×0.5)/2] = 34.5, Mp(proton) = 1.008, Ml = [(55.847×1 + 78.96×0.5 
+ 127.6 × 0.5)/2] = 79.5635 and Ed = 40 eV. Φt = 1×1015 cm-2, Ep = 190 keV 

(3) Calculation of Ep,av for FeSe, irradiated by electron beam:18) 

Ep,av = 15.32 eV and Tm = 81.39 eV have been calculated, taking the values of Zp(electron) = 
1, Zl = [(26 + 34)/2] = 30, Mp(electron) = 5.486×10-4 amu, Ml = [(55.847×1 + 78.96×1)/2] = 
67.404 and Ed = 40 eV. Φt = 1.12×1019 cm-2, Ep = 2.5 MeV electron. 

 
 
Table I includes the above-calculated T(max) and Ep,av for earlier and our irradiations. Here, we 

find that our radiation on Ba(Fe0.943Co0.057)2As2 has dea or Ep,av (mean energy transferred by 

the  irradiation  to  an  atom  of  the  target  lattice)  higher  than  that  of  the  three  other  charged 
particle irradiations.9,18)    Based on the concept of lattice compression due to radiation damage 

only, this higher dea can give somewhat higher Tc rise, but not the large ~ 8 K rise.

4.3.3 Discussion of Tc Increase by High-Pressure Bubbles 

Being  insoluble,  inert  gas  atoms  coming  inside  a  solid  by  ion  implantation  or  through 

nuclear  reaction  in  a  reactor  often  tend  to  agglomerate  and  form  HP  bubbles,  as  already 

mentioned. All measurements in the literature show the pressure built up in the bubbles to be 

very  high,  although  quantitative  results  of  different  investigations  differ.  According  to  the 

phase diagram, Ar gas condenses forming a solid phase at pressures above 1 GPa , even at a 
temperature as high as 300 K.13) The following data on bubbles are room temperature values. 

These  will  somewhat  change  on  cooling  due  to  difference  in  contraction  of  the  lattice  and 

condensed  bubbles.  In  our  Ref.11,  Felde  et  al.  (1984)  measured  pressure,  P,  for  Ar 

implantation in Al: P(from energy shift of valence excitations) = 6(3.5) GPa and P (from TEM 

diffraction patterns) = 3 GPa, in r =15 Å bubbles. Faraci et al. (Ref. 12) found evidence for 

crystalline over-pressurized Ar clusters in Al (2.5 GPa) and Si (4.4 GPa). Here, we add that 

Fe-superconductors  are  metallic  in  nature.  Faraci  et  al.  extended  their  work  in  1997  to 

high-pressure  Kr  clusters  in  Be  and  Si  using  XANES.  Smaller  ions  like  H  and  He  behave 

somewhat differently on implantation. Still, we note that Djukica et al. (2007) probed elastic 

strains in the compound LiNbO3 due to He-implantation. We, therefore, understand that inert 

gas  ion  implantation  can  form  HP  bubbles  in  metals  and  semiconductors  to  compress  the 

lattice  around  the  bubbles.  Same  should  be  possible  for  Ar  implantation  in  Ba(Fe,Co)2As2. 

Such compressed regions should have enhanced Tc. 

Reports like the Karlsruhe report of ~15 K increase of Tc under a pressure of ~ 3.5 Gpa in 

underdoped Ba(Fe(1-x)Cox)2As2 and the above-expected high pressure of Ar bubbles formed in 

present  samples  by  Ar-implantation,  should  lead  to  large  enhancement  of  Tc  in  isolated 
compressed  regions  around  the HP  bubbles  in  present samples.10)    We  will  go  to  the  details 
after outlining the explanation of Ozaki et al.9) 

Fig.3 of Ref.9 is the experimentally obtained internal strain map of p-irradiated FeSe0.5Te0.5 

films (with unirradiated Tc of 18 K) of Ozaki et al., and their perspective view of the resulting 
spatial  distribution  of  enhanced  Tc.9)    They  experimentally  found  their  irradiated  film  to 

consist of two types of “nano-regions”: (highly compressed) high-Tc regions (with Tc reaching

25 K) and (highly stretched) low-Tc regions (with Tc dropping up to 15 K), the regions being 
linked  in  a  cobweb-like  network.9)    The  greater  volume  fraction  of  the  compressive  strain 

regions and proximity effect resulted in the enhanced bulk Tc of 18.5 K. Our observation of ~ 

8 K increase of bulk Tc, in contrast to the above-discussed ~ 0.5 K increase, is interestingly 

larger.  This  large  increase  can  now  be  attributed  to  implanted  Ar  agglomerating  into 

high-pressure  precipitates  in  form  of  bubbles  in  the  implantation  region  of  our  sample. 

Superconducting critical temperature of our Ba(Fe, Co)2As2 sample was Tc(χʺ)= 16 K before 

the  Ar-implantation.  Localized  highly  compressed  regions  around  these  high  pressure  Ar 

bubbles  in  the  irradiated  samples  will  have  much  enhanced  superconducting  critical 

temperature,  Tc(χʺ)  >>  16  K, in a  lower  Tc  surrounding.  This  is similar  to above-mentioned 

perspective  view  of  Ozaki  et  al.,  but  expected  to  involve  much  higher  pressure  as  already 

discussed. Such enhanced Tc regions can link  up  by  proximity effect if  their separations are 

shorter  than  the  coherence  length,  to  give  the  observed  bulk  Tc(χʺ)  of  24  K.  Future 

characterizations  similar  to  that  of  Ozaki  et  al.  can  experimentally  confirm  the  presently 

offered  explanations,  while  the  irradiation-enhancement  of  bulk  Tc  has  been  presently 

confirmed by measuring four superconducting parameters.   

5.  Conclusion 

Superconducting Critical Temperature (Tc) was measured for ~ 200 μm thick single-crystal 

samples  of  a  popular  iron  pnictide  superconductor,  Ba(FexCo(1-x))2As2,  for  x  =  0.057 
(underdoped),  before  and  after  1.5  MeV  Ar6+  irradiation  to  a  fluence  of  2.5  ×  1015  Ar/cm2. 

Measurements  of  magnetic  susceptibility  (χʹ  and  χʺ),  electrical  resistivity  (ρ),  and 

magnetization convincingly show that this irradiation surprisingly increased Tc by ~ 49% or ~ 

8 K. This is in stark contrast to the usual decrease of Tc by different irradiations in different 

superconductors.  Also,  Tc  increase,  if  any,  has  been  much  smaller  in  the  few  earlier 

observations of Tc increase in Fe-HTSCs.   

In  fact,  ion  or  other  radiation  usually  damages  or  degrades  superconductivity  sustaining 

features like the structure of a superconducting material,  leading  to a  decrease of  Tc.  So, an 

overall  increase  of  Tc  by  irradiation  has  to  involve  new  phenomena.  One  new  phenomenon 

was  lattice  compression  in  nano-regions  due  to  proton  radiation  damage  in  t  <  R  films  of 
FeSe0.5Te0.5 with Tc = 18K. However, this  increased the bulk Tc from 18 K to 18.5 K only.9) 

Our ~8  K  increase of Tc can be  explained  by  invoking  an additional  source  of  high  internal 

pressure. 

Among the reported irradiations, our experiment alone allows ion implantation. It is likely, 

 
 
10 

as  already  discussed,  that  implanted  Ar  forms  high-pressure  miniature  bubbles  that  produce 

additional and large compression of the lattice. In fact, internal pressure up to 6 GPa has been 
reported  for  Ar  bubbles  in  metals.20)  We  have  also  pointed  out  that  Tc  of  an  x  = 
0.041(underdoped)  crystal  increased  from  10  K  to  25  K  under  a  pressure  of  3.5  GPa.10) 

Therefore,  we  propose  that  the  present  Ar-implantation  with  self-agglomeration  of  Ar  into 

high-pressure solid Ar bubbles, has formed nano-regions of highly enhanced Tc. These high Tc 

nano-regions link up through the proximity effect and lead to a fairly high enhancement (~ 8 

K) of the bulk Tc. To our knowledge, neither such large radiation-induced increase of bulk Tc 

in Fe HTSCs nor the explanation based on high-pressure bubble formation of implanted inert 

atoms has been discussed by other authors in the literature. Obviously, more ion implantation 

(t  >  R) and radiation  damage (t  <  R) experiments  with  microstructural  and  superconducting 

characterizations  of  pre-  and  post-irradiated  Fe-HTSC  samples  are  necessary  for  a  more 

confirmed  understanding.  Such  large  Tc  enhancement  may  be  discovered  in  other 

superconductors as well. On the application side,  inert gas ion  implantation  with  HP  bubble 

formation may lead to the advantages of higher superconducting transition temperatures.
