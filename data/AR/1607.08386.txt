ABSTRACT

PG 1159 stars are hot, hydrogen-deﬁcient (pre-) white dwarfs with atmospheres mainly composed of helium, carbon, and oxygen. The
unusual surface chemistry is the result of a late helium-shell ﬂash. Observed element abundances enable us to test stellar evolution
models quantitatively with respect to their nucleosynthesis products formed near the helium-burning shell of the progenitor asymptotic
giant branch stars. Because of the high eﬀective temperatures (Teﬀ), abundance determinations require ultraviolet spectroscopy and
non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmosphere analyses. Up to now, we have presented results for the prototype of this
spectral class and two cooler members (Teﬀ in the range 85 000–140 000 K). Here we report on the results for two even hotter stars
(PG 1520+525 and PG 1144+005, both with Teﬀ = 150 000 K) which are the only two objects in this temperature–gravity region for
which useful far-ultraviolet spectra are available, and revisit the prototype star. Previous results on the abundances of some species
are conﬁrmed, while results on others (Si, P, S) are revised. In particular, a solar abundance of sulphur is measured in contrast to
earlier claims of a strong S deﬁciency that contradicted stellar evolution models. For the ﬁrst time, we assess the abundances of Na,
Al, and Cl with newly constructed non-LTE model atoms. Besides the main constituents (He, C, O), we determine the abundances
(or upper limits) of N, F, Ne, Na, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, and Fe. Generally, good agreement with stellar models is found.

Key words. stars: abundances – stars: atmospheres – stars: evolution – stars: AGB and post-AGB – white dwarfs

1. Introduction

PG 1159 stars are hydrogen-deﬁcient and occupy the hot end of
the white dwarf cooling sequence (eﬀective temperatures rang-
ing between Teﬀ = 75 000 K and 250 000 K, Werner & Herwig
2006; Werner et al. 2014; Werner & Rauch 2015). Their sur-
faces are dominated by helium-rich intershell matter dredged up
by a late helium-shell ﬂash (thermal pulse, TP). The main atmo-
spheric constituents are helium and carbon (He = 0.30–0.92, C =
0.08–0.60, mass fractions), often accompanied by large amounts
of oxygen (up to 0.20). The high abundances of C and O are wit-
ness to eﬃcient overshoot of intershell convection in asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars, drawing these elements from the C–O
stellar core (Herwig et al. 1999; Herwig 2000; Miller Bertolami
2016). Measured overabundances of neon conﬁrm this picture.
Our investigation of these stars now concentrates on the trace
elements up to the iron group. Quantitative spectroscopic abun-
dance determinations can be compared to predictions from nu-
cleosynthesis calculations in stellar evolution models for AGB
stars.

The ﬁrst comprehensive analysis of trace metal abundances
was performed for the prototype of the PG 1159 spectroscopic
class, PG 1159−035 (Teﬀ = 140 000 K, Jahn et al. 2007). Then,
two cooler objects from this group were analysed (PG 1424+535
and PG 1707+427, Teﬀ = 110 000 and 85 000 K, Werner et al.
2015).

Prerequisites for these types of work are ultraviolet (UV)
spectroscopic observations and model atmospheres accounting
for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE),
because of the high eﬀective temperatures. The far-UV spec-

tral range covered by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer
(FUSE, 912–1188 Å) is a most rewarding source.

In the present paper, we assess the element abundances of
two representatives of this group that are hotter than the proto-
type, namely 150 000 K: PG 1520+525 and PG 1144+005. They
are the hottest PG 1159 stars for which useful FUSE data are
available. For their analysis we developed new non-LTE model
atoms, concentrating on high ionisation stages, particularly for
elements not considered previously (Na, Mg, Al, Cl). We strive
to identify spectral lines that have not been observed before in
any stellar spectrum. The eﬀective temperature of both stars
is only rivaled by a few low-gravity PG 1159-type central stars
with Teﬀ up to 170 000 K (K1–16, RX J2117.1+3412, NGC 246,
Longmore 4; Werner et al. 2010) for which good FUSE spectra
are available. But for a comprehensive quantitative analysis, they
require expanding-atmosphere models and the design of model
atoms for even higher ionisation stages. In addition to the two
program stars, we revisit the prototype itself. It is necessary and
useful to analyse a larger number of these stars because, accord-
ing to stellar models, the abundances of individual trace elements
strongly depend on the stellar mass.

2. The program stars

Both stars analysed in this paper were discovered in the Palomar-
Green Survey (Green et al. 1986). PG 1520+525 was identi-
ﬁed as a very hot He-rich degenerate, classiﬁed a PG 1159 star,
and a parameter estimate based on LTE models was attempted
(Teﬀ ≈ 100 000 K, log (g/cm s−2) > 6, Wesemael et al. 1985).
PG 1144+005 was classiﬁed a PG 1159 star by Basile & Holberg
(1985) and Green et al. (1986). Both objects are non-pulsators

discovered and N < 4 · 10−3 was derived. Utilizing UV spectra
taken with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph aboard
the Hubble Space Telescope, these parameters were improved
by Dreizler & Heber (1998): Teﬀ = 150 000 ± 7500 K, log g =

Adamczak et al. 2012).

Abundances of further elements were measured from FUSE
spectra. Ne = 0.02 and F = 10−4 was determined (Werner et al.
2004, 2005). Preliminary results for other light element abun-
dances were presented by Reiﬀ et al. (2007): Si < 3.6 × 10−5,
P = 6.4 × 10−6, S = 5.0 × 10−5. An upper abundance limit for
argon of roughly solar was derived (Ar < 8 × 10−5, Werner et al.
2007a). From the lack of Fe vii lines, an upper abundance limit
of Fe < 0.3 solar was estimated (Miksa et al. 2002). Finally,
from a ﬁt to newly identiﬁed Fe viii lines, a solar iron abundance
was claimed (Werner et al. 2011).

2.2. PG1144+005

The ﬁrst non-LTE analysis was performed by Werner & Heber
(1991) using optical spectra. They found Teﬀ = 150 000 ±
15 000 K, log g = 6.5 ± 0.5, He = 0.39, C = 0.58, O = 0.016. A
relatively high nitrogen abundance was determined (N = 0.015).
As in the case of PG 1520+525, abundances of further ele-
ments were measured from FUSE spectra. Ne = 0.02 was found
from an analysis, including optical spectra (Werner et al. 2004)
and F = 10−5 was determined (Werner et al. 2005). Prelimi-
nary results for other light element abundances were presented
by Reiﬀ et al. (2007): Si < 7.3 × 10−5, P = 6.4 × 10−6, S =

lar was derived (Ar < 8 × 10−5, Werner et al. 2007a). From a
ﬁt to Fe viii lines in FUSE spectra, a solar iron abundance was

3. Observations and line identiﬁcations

The raw FUSE data for the program stars were retrieved from
the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). The obser-
vation IDs were P1320201 for PG 1144+005, and P1320101,
F0200101, F0200102 for PG 1520+525. Both were observed
through the LWRS spectrograph aperture, and the data were ob-
tained in time-tag mode. We describe the data reduction in some
detail because the previous reductions in our earlier work did
not go past the point of coaligning spectra from exposures for
the eight individual channels separately, whereas now the spec-
tra from the individual channels were combined into a single
spectrum.

The exposures obtained in the observations P1320101 and
P1320201 were photometric in all channels, with exposure-to-
exposure ﬂux variations under 1%, indicating good alignment,
and consistent to within a few percent when comparing one
channel to another. Only one exposure was successful in each
of F0200101 and F0200102, and pointing was unstable for por-
tions of these exposures; the resulting spectra were normalized
to match the earlier P1320101 data.

Raw data were processed twice with CalFUSE v3.2.3: once
with screening parameters set to extract data only during orbital
night, and once to extract data during orbital day. Zero-point
oﬀsets in the wavelength scale were adjusted for each exposure
by shifting each spectrum to coalign narrow interstellar absorp-
tion features. The individual exposures from each observation
were then combined to form composite day and night spectra for

Article number, page 4 of 8

each channel. The day and night spectra were then compared
at the locations of all the known airglow emission lines. If the
day spectra showed any excess ﬂux in comparison to the night
spectra at those wavelengths, the corresponding pixels in the day
spectra were ﬂagged as bad and were not included in subsequent
processing. Signiﬁcant airglow was only present during orbital
night at Lyman β, and faint emission can be discerned at Ly-
man γ. This residual emission would aﬀect ﬁts to the interstellar
absorption at these wavelengths, but has no impact on any of the
analyses we present.

Some additional customized processing was performed for
PG 1520+525. The ﬁrst ≈ 350 seconds of the ﬁrst and third
exposures were lost to the limb-angle screening with the de-
fault processing settings. However, an examination of the data
showed that the violation of the limb angle constraint was slight,
so we modiﬁed the constraint check to regain over 700 sec-
onds of exposure time. Similarly, 315 seconds were lost to
burst screening in detector 2A during F0200101, and losses in
F0200102 ranged from 135 seconds in detector 2B to 432 sec-
onds in detector 1A. An examination of the raw data showed no
obvious background enhancement from the event burst, so the
processing was performed with a higher burst-detection thresh-
old to regain the lost exposure time. The net exposure time was
6 830 seconds for PG 1144+005, with just slight variations from
channel to channel, and ranged from a low of 7 758 seconds in
the SiC1b spectrum to 8 600 seconds in the LiF1a spectrum for
PG 1520+525.

The ﬁnal step was to combine the spectra from the four in-
strument channels into a single composite spectrum. Because
of residual distortions in the wavelength scale in each channel,
additional shifts of localized regions of each spectrum were re-
quired to coalign the spectra; these shifts were typically only 1–2
pixels. Bad pixels resulting from detector defects were ﬂagged
at this point and excluded from further processing. Finally, the
spectra were resampled onto a common wavelength scale and
combined, weighting by signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) on a pixel-
by-pixel basis.

The ﬁnal spectrum has S/N = 13–23 per 0.013 Å pixel for
PG 1520+525, and 14–26 per pixel for PG 1144+005. The ef-
fects of ﬁxed-pattern noise are minimized by the fact that the
positions of the spectra on the detectors varied during each ob-
servation, and by the fact that nearly every wavelength bin was
sampled by at least two diﬀerent detectors.

The FUSE spectra of both program stars (Figs. 1 and 2) are
quite similar to that of the prototype PG 1159−035, as can be
expected from the similar atmospheric parameters. They are
dominated by broad lines from He ii, C iv, and O vi, and ex-
hibit some lines of light metals that will be discussed below (see
Jahn et al. 2007, for detailed line lists established for the proto-
In PG 1520+525, we also identify lines of O v, which
type).
are seen in PG 1159−035, too, but which were not identiﬁed
in previous work (Jahn et al. 2007). Detailed information about
O v lines was compiled for two cool PG 1159 stars (Werner et al.
2015). O v is not detected in PG 1144+005. Ionisation is shifted
to higher stages because the surface gravity is one dex lower than
that of PG 1520+525. We also see iron lines in PG 1159−035
and our program stars (Fe vii and Fe viii, Werner et al. 2011).
Other species are discussed in detail below. The FUSE spec-
tra shown in this paper were wavelength shifted such that the
photospheric lines are at rest wavelengths according to the mea-
sured radial velocities of 15 ± 5 km s−1 and 10 ± 5 km s−1 for
PG 1144+005 and PG 1520+525.

lines, we used the program OWENS (Hébrard et al. 2002;
Hébrard & Moos 2003). This can consider diﬀerent clouds with
individual radial and turbulent velocities, temperatures, column
densities, and chemical compositions. In the FUSE observations
of both stars, we identiﬁed ISM lines of H i, D i, H2, C i–iii, N i–
ii, O i, Si ii, P ii, S iii, Ar i, and Fe ii. The blue graphs in Figs. 1
and 2 show the photospheric models including the ISM lines.

Interstellar reddening is E(B − V) = 0.015 ± 0.010 for both
stars, determined by comparing model ﬂuxes normalized to mea-
sured 2MASS infrared colours (Ks = 16.282 for PG 1144+005
and J = 16.381 for PG 1520+525, Debes et al. 2011) with the
continuum ﬂux and spectral shape of the FUSE spectra.

4. Model atoms and model atmospheres

We used the Tübingen Model Atmosphere Package (TMAP)
to compute non-LTE, plane-parallel,
line-blanketed atmo-
sphere models
in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium
(Werner & Dreizler 1999; Werner et al. 2003). They include the
three most abundant elements, namely He, C, and O. All other
species were treated, one by one, as trace elements, i.e., keeping
the atmospheric structure ﬁxed. In the same manner, an extended

model atom for C was introduced, meaning that non-LTE popu-
lation numbers were computed for highly-excited levels, which
were treated in LTE during the preceding model-atmosphere
computations. Table 2 summarizes the number of considered
non-LTE levels and radiative transitions between them. All
model atoms were built from the publicly available Tübingen
Model Atom Database (TMAD1, constructed as part of the Ger-
man Astrophysical Virtual Observatory, GAVO), which is com-
prised of data from diﬀerent sources, namely Bashkin & Stoner
(1975),
the databases of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST2), the Opacity Project3 (OP, Seaton et al.
1994), CHIANTI4 (Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al. 2013), as well
as the Kentucky Atomic Line List5. We put signiﬁcant eﬀort into
the development and testing of model atoms for species that had
not been investigated before in hot PG1159 stars (Na, Mg, Al,
Cl) with an emphasis on the highest ionization stages.

For iron we used a statistical approach, employing typically
seven superlevels per ion linked by superlines, together with
an opacity sampling method (Anderson 1989; Rauch & Deetjen
2003). Ionization stages Fe vi–ix augmented by a single, ground-
level stage Fe x were considered. We used the complete line list
of Kurucz (so-called LIN lists, comprising about 1.2 × 106 lines
of the considered ions; Kurucz 1991, 2009, 2011) for the com-
putation of the non-LTE population numbers, and the so-called
POS lists (that include only the subset of lines with well known,
experimentally observed line positions) for the ﬁnal spectrum
synthesis.

5. Results

For the abundance analysis, we adopted the eﬀective tempera-
ture and surface gravity values of both stars that had been de-
termined in previous work. We found no hint from the FUSE
spectra that these values need improvement. This is corrobo-
rated by the relative strengths of Si v and Si vi lines which are
well matched by the models. The new detection of many O v
lines in PG 1520+525 together with O vi lines additionally con-
ﬁrms that the basic photospheric parameters, Teﬀ and log g , are

well established. The same holds for the abundance of the main
atmospheric constituents (He, C, and O).

In the following, we discuss the abundance determinations
for trace elements in detail. Results for the two program stars are
given in Table 1 and compared to the prototype PG 1159−035.
They are also displayed graphically in Fig. 3 in comparison to
PG 1159−035 and two other previously analysed PG 1159 stars
(PG 1707+427 and PG 1424+535, Werner et al. 2015). Typical
errors are 0.3 dex.

Nitrogen. The relatively high N abundance in PG 1144+005
was found from optical spectroscopy and cannot be further as-
sessed with the FUSE spectrum. The strongest lines in the model
are N v 4d–6f and 4f–6g at 1048.2 Å and 1049.7 Å, but they are
blended by strong interstellar lines in the observation. The next
strongest feature is the 4p–6d doublet at 1019.0/1019.3 Å, but it
is blended by a strong photospheric O vi line and an interstellar
line. For the same reason, the upper N limit for PG 1520+525,
derived previously from the N v resonance doublet, cannot be
improved.

Fluorine, neon, argon, iron. The previously determined abun-
dances of F, Ne, Ar (upper limits), and Fe in both stars are con-
ﬁrmed.

A weak Ne vi line appearing in the models at 1186.6 Å is
possibly present in PG 1144+005. The line is not listed in the
NIST and Kentucky databases but in the CHIANTI database.
The oscillator strength given there is f = 0.068, while we use
the larger OP value of f = 0.097 in our models. A stronger
Ne vi line in the models, that is also listed in the NIST database,
is seen at 972.93 Å (near the Ne vii 973.33 Å line). However, it
is blended by strong interstellar lines.

The model for PG 1144+005 displays the 5f–6g and 5g–
6h lines of Ar viii at 1155.0 and 1164.1 Å (Hegazy et al. 1997).
However, their wavelength positions are not well enough known
(±0.84 and ±1.2 Å, Kentucky database) to identify them with
features in the observed spectra. We speculated about the pres-
ence of these argon lines in the hottest PG 1159 stars (e.g., K1–
16, Werner et al. 2007b).

Sodium. Our models predict detectable, i.e., strong enough
lines of Na v and Na vi only at high abundances of the order
0.01. Even worse, the line positions are not suﬃciently accu-

well known wavelength position (1114.08 Å, NIST) appears, but
no tight abundance limit can be derived (Na < 0.01). Neither the
model for PG 1520+525 exhibits this line because of its higher
gravity, nor the model for PG 1159−035, because of its lower
temperature.

Magnesium. Our models predict Mg v lines which should be
detectable if the abundance is higher than about 10−3. Unfortu-
nately, these lines are not listed in NIST and Kentucky databases
so that their wavelength position seems uncertain. Consequently,
not even an upper limit can be derived. The same holds for a sin-
gle Mg vii line in the model for PG 1144+005.

Aluminum. Our models predict weak lines from Al v and Al vi
that can be used to assess the Al abundance. The strongest com-
puted lines of these ions are Al v 1068.26 Å and 1088.67 Å, that

plet. In PG 1520+525, weak line features are at these wavelength

Al shifts to higher stages because of the lower gravity (hence
lower particle densities). Therefore, the derived upper limit is
less strict, namely Al < 1.0 × 10−3. The Al abundance in the pro-
totype, PG 1159−035, has hitherto not been investigated. Using
an appropriate model atmosphere, we derive Al < 3.2 × 10−4.

Silicon. We identiﬁed a few weak lines from Si v (975.8,
1118.8 Å) and Si vi (1131.0, 1142.4, 1148.6, 1152.8 Å). We ob-
tain best-model ﬁts at a solar abundance value (Si = 6.6 × 10−4)
for both stars, hence, we do not conﬁrm the stricter upper limits
derived by Reiﬀ et al. (2007) from the absence of Si iv lines in
the FUSE observations.

Phosphorus. From the nondetection of the P v resonance dou-
blet (1118, 1128 Å), we derive an upper limit of P < 3.0 × 10−5
for both stars. This value is more conservative than the limits
claimed by Reiﬀ et al. (2007).

Sulphur. From the S vi 933/944 Å resonance doublet (Fig. 4)
and from two much weaker subordinate lines at 1000.5 Å and
1117.8 Å, we ﬁnd S = 1.0×10−4 and 3.1×10−4 for PG 1144+005
and PG 1520+525, respectively, being solar within error limits.
This result is in stark contrast to the earlier results reported by
Reiﬀ et al. (2007) that indicate a one dex subsolar abundance for
these stars. We discovered that the low S values resulted from
an error in the S vi model atom (wrong statistical weights for
two energy levels) employed for the computation of the non-LTE
population numbers.

We mention that the error in the model atom also aﬀected the
sulphur abundance determination in the prototype PG 1159−035

in our earlier work (Jahn et al. 2007). A surprisingly low value of
just 2% solar was found, whereas a reanalysis with our corrected
model atom arrives at a solar abundance.

Chlorine. Lines of Cl vii enable us to put an upper abundance
limit, though it is not very tight. Cl vii is a one-valence-electron
system. The strongest predicted lines are from the 4d–5p transi-
tion (997.03 Å and 999.32 Å) and the 5f–7g transition at 944.1 Å
but, for the latter, the wavelength uncertainty is too large (0.57 Å;
Kentucky database). From the former we ﬁnd Cl < 10−3 for both
program stars as well as for PG 1159−035.

6. Summary and discussion

We have analysed FUV spectra of two hot PG 1159 stars
(PG 1144+005 and PG 1520+525, both Teﬀ = 150 000 K) with
the focus on element abundance determinations. Previously ob-
tained values for Teﬀ and log g were conﬁrmed. With our im-
proved model atmospheres, we additionally derived new ﬁndings
on the prototype itself (PG 1159−035; 140 000 K). The results
for these three objects are summarized in Table 1. In Fig. 3, the
element abundances are displayed, together with the results for
two cooler PG 1159 stars (PG 1707+427 and PG 1424+535 with
85 000 and 110 000 K; Werner & Rauch 2014). Taken together,
these ﬁve objects represent the only PG 1159 stars with compre-
hensive element abundance determinations.

For the comparison of the results with evolutionary models,
stellar masses are relevant. In Table 3 we list the spectroscopic
masses derived by comparing them with the observed values of
Teﬀ and log g with evolutionary tracks by Althaus et al. (2009).
For the two pulsators in the sample, asteroseismic masses are
also available, being in good agreement with the spectroscopic
values. Also listed are the masses of the main-sequence pro-
genitors, as estimated from the initial-to-ﬁnal mass relation of
Weidemann (2000), taking into account the uncertainties of the
spectroscopic masses.

The previously determined abundances of the main atmo-
spheric constituents (He, C, O, Ne) in our two program stars
were conﬁrmed. The same holds for N, F, Ar, and Fe. The in-
vestigation on Si, P, and S gave improved results compared to
earlier, preliminary work. For the ﬁrst time, we have assessed
the abundances of Na, Al, and Cl, and derived upper limits.

We used our model atmosphere grid to reassess the abun-
dances of trace elements in the prototype PG 1159−035. The
main result is an improved S abundance, which is solar in con-
trast to the strong S depletion (0.02 solar) claimed by Jahn et al.

(2007), which was caused by an error in the model atom. We
also derived upper limits for Na, Al, and Cl for this star.

The results can be compared to evolutionary models by
Shingles & Karakas (2013), who presented intershell abun-
dances for stars with initial masses of 1.8–6 M⊙.
For
PG 1159−035, the authors found good agreement for the species
investigated (He, C, O, F, Ne, Si, P, S, Fe) with the excep-
tion of sulphur. As pointed out, this discrepancy is now re-
solved. For the two cool PG 1159 stars mentioned above, good
agreement of observed and predicted element abundances was
found (Werner & Rauch 2014). As to our two program stars,
all element abundances are similar to those found for the other
three PG 1159 stars (Fig. 3) and, hence, conﬁrm the evolution-
ary models. For a thorough discussion, we can therefore refer
to Werner & Rauch (2014), however, N, Na, Al, and Cl deserve
particular attention here. The Na and Cl abundances in PG 1159
stars were examined for the ﬁrst time.

PG 1144+005 is remarkable because of its relatively large N
abundance. This phenomenon is shared by some other PG 1159
stars (like the mentioned cooler object PG 1707+427) and is at-
tributed to the fact that these objects suﬀered their last thermal
pulse when they already were white dwarfs (so-called very late
thermal pulse, VLTP).

Only for PG 1144+005 could a useful upper limit for the
sodium abundance be derived, which is 341 times oversolar.
Karakas & Shingles (priv. comm.) report that the Na intershell
abundance at the last thermal pulse in the 1.8 and 3 M⊙ models
presented in Shingles & Karakas (2013) has increased consider-
ably to 23.1 and 18.1 times oversolar after the last thermal pulse.
This is still well below our detection limit.

For aluminum, upper limits of 18 and 6 times solar were
derived for PG 1144+005 and PG 1520+525. The Al intershell
abundance at the last thermal pulse in the mentioned 1.8 and
3 M⊙ models is 1.5 and 2 times the initial solar value. Hence,
the rather modest production of Al is conﬁrmed by our result.

For the two program stars, as well as for PG 1159−035, only
a high upper limit of Cl = 10−3 was derived, which is about two
dex oversolar. The intershell abundance in the 1.8 M⊙ and 3 M⊙
models has increased to 2.3 and 2.1 times oversolar after the last
thermal pulse, i.e., well below our detection limit.

To summarize, the abundances of elements up to iron in
PG 1159 stars is in good agreement with intershell abundances
predicted by stellar-evolution models. For a number of interest-
ing species (Na, Al, Cl), however, only upper limits can be de-
rived by spectral analyses. It turned out that for the relevant ion-
isation stages (iv–vii), precise atomic data is lacking, impeding
line identiﬁcations. This obstacle can only be overcome by lab-
oratory measurements. The detailed investigation into the trace
element abundances as a function of stellar mass is additionally
hindered by the relatively large uncertainty in the spectroscopic
mass determination, which itself is due to the uncertainty of the
surface gravity measurement (±0.5 dex). Considerable improve-
ment is expected from accurate parallaxes that will be provided
by GAIA.
