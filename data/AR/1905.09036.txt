Abstract

We introduce a new method for computing spectra of molecules for which a spin-spin term in

the Hamiltonian has an important eﬀect. In previous calculations, matrix elements of the spin-spin

term and of the potential were obtained by expanding the potential and using analytic equations in

terms of 3

−

j symbols. Instead, we use quadrature. Quadrature is simple and makes it possible to

do calculations with a general potential and without using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. In previous

calculations, the Hamiltonian matrix was built and diagonalized.

Instead, we use an iterative

eigensolver. It makes it easy to work with a large basis. The ideas are tested by computing energy

levels of NH(3Σ−)-He, O2(3Σ−

g )-Ar and O2(3Σ−

g )-He.

INTRODUCTION

Multi-dimensional quadrature makes it possible to compute the ro-vibrational spectrum

of a molecule, even when the potential energy surface (PES) does not have a special form that

facilitates calculating integrals. Individual matrix elements could themselves be computed by

using multi-dimensional quadrature, however, by using an iterative eigensolver in conjunction

with multi-dimensional quadrature, spectra can be computed without calculating potential

matrix elements.

[1–9] It is only necessary to evaluate matrix-vector products (MVPs). A

MVP transforms an input vector into an output vector. The output vector can be obtained

by doing sums sequentially. This sequential summation procedure has important advantages:

1) it can be used regardless of the functional form of the PES; 2) the cost of calculating MVPs

scales as it would if the PES were a sum of products (SOP), i.e., it is not more expensive

to use a general PES than a SOP PES (and is less expensive unless the SOP has very few

terms ); 3) there is no need to derive and use closed-form equations for complicated integrals.

MVPs are evaluated eﬃciently by exploiting product structure imposed by using a basis of

products of 1-D functions and a product quadrature grid.

In this paper, we show that a quadrature method for computing the ro-vibrational spec-

trum of a molecule for which interaction between rotational angular momenta and electronic

spin angular momentum is important has the same advantages. We are not the ﬁrst to

include this interaction in a variational calculation.

[10–12] Several eﬀective ﬁtting Hamil-

tonians that include such interactions have been derived and used.

[13–17] In previous

variational calculations, elements of a Hamiltonian matrix were computed using closed-form

expressions and a Hamiltonian matrix was stored and diagonalized with a direct (not iter-

ative) algorithm, whose cost scales as N 3, where N is the size of the matrix. To do this

one relies on a special representation of the PES in terms of Legendre polynomials and uses

formulae involving 3

j symbols and reduced matrix elements to calculate matrix elements

−

of both the PES and the spin interaction term. The method we present works with general

PESs. We obviate the need for 3-j symbols and concerns about phase conventions etc. by

computing matrix elements of the spin interaction term and the PES with quadrature. All

MVPs are done by evaluating sums sequentially. In this paper, we propose equations for a

complex with three atoms AB-R; AB is a diatomic molecule in a 3Σ electronic state with

2

electron spin S = 1 and R is a closed-shell atom with zero spin. Everything is done us-

ing a body-ﬁxed basis that is advantageous when the anisotropy of the PES is strong. We

test our equations by computing energy levels for O2-Ar, O2-He and NH-He. Tennyson and

co-workers were the ﬁrst to do calculations on O2-Ar, O2-He.

[10, 11] Van der Avoird and

Brocks[18] have done calculations for O2 dimer.

II. VIBRATION-ROTATION-SPIN KINETIC ENERGY OPERATOR

To derive the correct kinetic energy operator (KEO), it is best to begin with the dimer-

ﬁxed (DF) frame KEO for a complex composed of two monomers which we denote A and B.

The DF frame is a two-angle body-ﬁxed (BF) frame. It is obtained by rotating a space-ﬁxed

(SF) frame by two Euler angles (α, β) so that the DF frame z-axis is aligned with r0, the

vector connecting the centers of mass of A and B. See Fig. 1a. As shown by Brocks et al.[19],

the DF KEO is

T DF = T A + T B + Tint

(1)

where B0(0) = 1/(2µr0r2
0). µ0 is the reduced mass. J is the total angular momentum. j is
the sum of the angular momenta of the two monomers. T A and T B are KEOs for monomers

A and B in the DF frame. Components of J and j are in the DF frame. The components

of J have a special form and are written in terms of α, β and jz (See Eq. (20) of Brocks et

al.[19]).

In this paper, we consider systems in which monomer A is a diatomic molecule in a 3Σ−
g

electronic state with electron spin S = 1 and monomer B is an atom. The total angular

momentum of monomer A is

j = N1 + S ,

(2)

where N1 is the rotational angular momentum associated with r1, the diatomic vector. See

Fig. 1a. N1 is usually called l1, if there is no spin. In the DF frame, the spherical polar

angles for vector r1 are (θ1, γ) ( γ is used for the azimuthal angle to be consistent with the

standard three-angle BF frame whose orientation in the SF frame is speciﬁed by three Euler

3

angles (α, β, γ)). The expressions for N1 operators in terms of (θ1, γ) are standard, see e.g.

Eq. (1.36) of Ref. 20. The spin-rovibrational KEO for monomer A is[21]

In this paper, the diatomic is rigid and therefore the second term in Eq. (6) is removed. In

summary, to derive the KEO that includes coupling between spin and rotation, one replaces

j in Tint with N1 + S, but uses N1 and not N1 + S in T A. Tﬁne also couples spin and

rotation.

III. BASIS AND MATRIX ELEMENTS

Knowing the KEO and having a potential, we calculate vibration-rotation-spin energy

levels by choosing a basis and evaluating matrix-vector products (MVPs) to use the Lanczos

algorithm. When spin eﬀects are omitted this is a common procedure.

[2, 6, 23, 24, 26]

When the Lanczos vectors are not orthogonalized, the memory and CPU costs are low. To

calculate wavefunctions we repeat the Lanczos iteration.[25–27] The vibration-rotation-spin

basis is a direct product of a stretch basis and a bend-rotation-spin basis. The stretch basis

functions are discrete variable representation (DVR) functions. [2] In the rest of the section,

we discuss only the bend-rotation-spin basis. Each bend-rotation-spin basis function is a

product,

total angular momentum J . Note that for a triatomic molecule with no spin, we normally

use

for the angular basis associated with r1. In this paper, we

N1mN1i
because we include the electronic spin angular momentum for the

diatomic. The basis of Eq. (7) can be written in terms of a standard symmetric top Wigner

because K

[28]

mN1 + mS. If S = 0, Eq. (8) is the standard triatomic vibration-rotation basis.

Tennyson and Mettes[10] did the ﬁrst variational calculation for O2-Ar. They used the SF

frame basis,

((NS)jL)JMJ i

|

, in the notation of Ref. 10, with MJ the SF Z-axis projection

of total J. Their basis was built by successively coupling pairs of angular momenta with

Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients. In our notation, this basis would be

((N1S)jl0)JM

. A notable

i

|

diﬀerence between their basis and our BF basis, Eq. (7), is that the BF basis does not have

the l0 quantum number because the z-axis of the BF frame is along r0. The BF basis also

does not have the j label. It does have projection quantum numbers along the BF z-axis.

To analytically evaluate potential integrals in their SF basis, Tennyson and Mettes expand

the potential in terms of Legendre polynomials. In the SF basis, equations for the matrix

elements of Tﬁne are known in terms of 3-j and 6-j symbols[21]. They are derived with the

Wigner-Eckart theorem.

We are not the ﬁrst to propose using the BF basis of Eq. (7). Van der Avoird used it

in Ref. 12, with perturbation theory, to explain the variational results of Tennyson and

Mettes[10]. Using the BF projection quantum numbers K and mN1, Van der Avoird iden-

tiﬁed ladder patterns in the variational levels. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem[21], he

derived analytic expressions for matrix elements of Tﬁne in the BF basis. These expressions

involve a 3-j symbol and double-bar reduced matrix elements. In section IV, we will pro-

pose a new method for calculating matrix elements of Tﬁne in the BF basis. Van der Avoird

and Brocks[18] use a BF basis to variationally compute ﬁne-structure levels of O2 dimer, a

problem more challenging than the triatomic in this paper.

As mentioned above, operators for the components of J in the DF frame have a special

form. Nonetheless, if mN1 in Eq. (8) is equal to K

mS, one obtains

N1mN1; JKM; SmSi

.

N1mN1; JKM; SmSi

(9)

Because of this equation, the matrix elements of J operators in the DF frame can be obtained

from the usual standard equations, as in the case of systems with no spin.[29] J 2

cot β∂/∂β

−

is diagonal and its non-zero elements are J(J + 1). Matrix elements of J± are also equal to

the usual expressions. [20] The constraint K = mN1 + mS has a physical interpretation. As

we see from Fig. 1a, the constraint arises because J = l0 + N1 + S and l0 has no projection

on the z-axis of the DF frame.

Non-zero diagonal KEO matrix elements, in the basis of Eq. (7), for all terms except the

S2

ζ term, which we shall focus on later in the paper, are:

A. Parity-adapted basis

We prefer to work with a parity-adapted uncoupled basis which has the advantage of being

two times smaller. The parity-adapted basis functions are equal to or linear combinations of

the uncoupled basis functions,

3Σ− electronic wavefunction has odd parity. This factor is not included in Eq. (14) and not

i

included in our tables and ﬁgures.

In this work, we label levels with their spectroscopic

parity e/f , which is (

1)J+P =

−

1, respectively. For a single parity, the number of parity-

±

adapted functions is roughly half the number of non-parity-adapted basis functions. The

parity-adapted and non-parity-adapted bases span the same space if the quantum numbers

are restricted by

mS ≥

0

(if mS = 0) .

(15)

These restrictions complicate the evaluation of MVPs in the parity-adapted basis and we

therefore transform from the PA basis to the basis of Eq. (8), evaluate the MVP in that

basis, and then transform back to the PA basis. Recall that mN1 is determined by mS and

K and is not an independent basis label.

Van der Avoird also used a parity-adapted basis in Eq. 12 of Ref. 12. His notation (

is equivalent to our (

1)J+S+P in Eq. (13). This is conﬁrmed by comparing the assignments

−

of our O2-Ar levels, reported in section VIII, with those of Ref. 12.

IV. MATRIX ELEMENTS OF THE SPIN INTERACTION TERM S2
ζ

We use the basis of Eq. (8) because when the anisotropy of the PES is strong it is an

excellent basis. Unfortunately, it is not simple to apply the spin interaction term to one of

the basis functions. The problem is that the spin interaction term is written in terms of Sζ,

the component of the spin operator along the diatomic axis, and the basis label mS is the

quantum number for the z component of the spin operator along the DF z axis which is

inter-monomer Jacobi vector. In order to calculate matrix elements of the spin interaction

term, we write each of the basis functions in terms of functions of a basis in which S2

ζ is

diagonal. The relation between these two spin bases is[20]

The integral in Eq. (17) is diagonal in M because the operator in the middle does not depend

in K. Owing to the diagonality in K, the integrand of the integral over β in Eq. (17) is a
M,K(β)dJ

product of two orthonormal functions, dJ

M,K(β) and is therefore unity. We can

therefore re-write Eq. (17) as,

the S2

ζ matrix therefore scales as Nbas, where Nbas is the size of the basis. One could use
ζ matrix to compute the matrix-vector product required
to use an iterative eigensolver. The cost of the MVP would then scale as Nbas. We prefer

2. The memory cost of storing the non-zero elements of

stored non-zero elements of the S2

to store the small A matrix of Eq. (20) and use sequential sums, as in Eq. (22), to compute

the matrix-vector product For our choice, the memory cost is smaller and the cost of the

matrix-vector product is similar. Not using analytic equations for matrix elements when it

is possible might seem less elegant, but quadrature reduces the memory cost and (not in

this case but in general) reduces the cost of evaluating MVPs. This is strikingly obvious

for potential MVPs. Quadrature is not approximate and does not increase the cost of the

calculations Moreover, the quadrature approach would also be straightforward even if Tf ine

involved complicated functions of Sζ operators and even if the angle between the ζ axis

and the BF z axis were a complicated function of the shape of the molecule. It also has

the advantage that one does not need to be careful about phase factor errors in analytical

expressions.

V. ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS

J and P are conserved quantum numbers and we calculate levels with diﬀerent values

separately.

It is fairly straightforward to assign values of K, mS, mN1, and N1 to every

energy level because the basis functions have these labels. To assign values of l0 and j0 is

harder because the basis functions do not have these labels. The assignments of projection

quantum numbers K, mS, mN1 are made with the approach of Ref. 9. For example, K

is assigned by summing the squares of expansion coeﬃcients in the non-PA basis over all

10

indices other than K to obtain a quantity we call PK, which is a measure of the contribution

of basis functions labelled by K to the full wavefunction. (

K PK = 1.) PK and P−K are
equal and PmN1 and P−mN1 are equal. We therefore cannot assign the signs of K, mS, and
mN1, however, using the relation, K = mN1 + mS, we can determine whether mS, and mN1

P

have the same or diﬀerent signs. For O2-Ar or O2-He, this allows us to determine whether

the DF z projections for the rotation of O2 and the spin of O2 are aligned or anti-aligned.

We also assign l0, j and N1 by computing expectation values of l2

quantum numbers if coupling is weak. For example, the expectation value of N 2

VI. AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF COMPUTING THE SPECTRUM

In the previous sections of this paper, we propose (method I) using quadrature with a

body-ﬁxed KEO whose z axis is along the inter-monomer Jacobi vector from the centre of

11

mass of O2 to the rare gas atom, in order to treat the spin interaction term proportional

to S2

ζ . In this section we outline a diﬀerent method (method II) that does not require any
quadrature and uses a body-ﬁxed KEO whose z axis is along the diatomic O2 vector. This

alternative method has disadvantages, but can be used to check calculations. In method I,

quadrature is necessary because the spin basis used to compute the spectrum,

SmSi

|

, has

the label mS for the projection along the inter-monomer Jacobi vector and must therefore

be replaced with a linear combination of spin functions,

|
projection along the diatomic Jacobi vector, in which S2

SΣ
i

, labelled by Σ (Eq. (16)), the

ζ is diagonal.

In method II, the

inter-monomer Jacobi vector is r1 and the diatomic Jacobi vector is r0. In our notation,

the BF z axis is along r0. The obvious advantage of method II is that S2

ζ is diagonal, i.e.

S2
ζ |

= m2
S|

SmSi
An important disadvantage of method II is that the Coriolis coupling is much larger than

: there is no need to introduce a second set of spin functions.

SmSi

for method I. Take NH-He as an example, the rotational constants are: bNH = 16.343 cm−1
and binter = 0.475 cm−1 (both evaluated at the equilibrium geometry on the PES used in this
work). In method I, B0 = binter = 0.475 cm−1 and in method II, B0 = bNH = 16.343 cm−1.

It is clear that the Coriolis interaction term, proportional to B0, is much larger in method

II. A second and perhaps more critical disadvantage of method II is that it is diﬃcult to

apply it to larger systems such as O2-CO where the second monomer is a closed-shell spinless

diatomic molecule rather than an atom. This is because if the BF z is along the O2 vector

then one needs polyspherical angles for CO that are angles relating the orientation of two

unconnected monomers and in terms of these angles potential coupling is large.

The KEO in method II has the same form as the KEO in method I. However, r0 is now the

diatomic Jacobi vector and r1 is now the inter-monomer Jacobi vector. The basis functions

are formally identical to those of method I, Eq. (7) and Eq. (8). Although r1 is now the

inter-monomer Jacobi vector and using N1 for its angular momentum is unconventional, we

prefer not to change the notation. The KEO terms T DF, Tint and T A take the same form.

The only formal change in the KEO is in the spin-rotation interaction term, the γ0-related

term (cf. Eq. (4)),

Tﬁne =

2
3

λ0(3S2

ζ −

S2) + γ0(J − N1 − S) · S .

(25)

This change is necessary because in method I the rotation of the diatomic molecule with

spin is described by r1 and its angular momentum N1 and in method II the rotation of the

12

diatomic molecule with spin is described by r0 and its angular momentum l0 = J −N1 −S.

Because of this change, the diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements change slightly. Non-

zero diagonal KEO matrix elements, in the basis of Eq. (7), for all terms including the S2
ζ

term, are:

VII. RESULTS: SPIN-ROVIBRATIONAL LEVELS OF NH(3Σ−)-HE

Using both method I and method II, we computed the spin-rovibration levels of NH(3Σ−)-

He, which were previously reported in Ref. 32. Cybulski et al. also used two methods: the

SF approach of Tennyson and Mettes[10, 11] and a BF method with the same basis we have

in method I (the z angular momentum and spin components that label basis functions are

along the inter-monomer Jacobi vector). The two sets of energies computed by Cybulski et

al. diﬀer by less than 0.0001 cm−1. Their accurate calculations allow us to test our methods.

We use the PES “potential I” of Ref. 32 and the same parameters: bNH = 16.343 cm−1 is the
rotational constant of NH in its ground vibrational state; λ0 = 0.920 cm−1 and γ0 =
cm−1 are, respectively, the spin-spin and spin-rotation interaction constants for NH. We

0.055

−

13

also use the same atomic masses, as in Ref. 32. The NH distance is ﬁxed throughout the

calculations.

The size of the bend basis is determined by max(N1) = 25; Cybulski et al. used a

maximum value of 8. 30 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are used for θ1, to integrate

the potential and S2

ζ term in Eq. 19. The stretch basis for r0 is 120 sine DVR functions
in the range [3.5, 35] a0. The total basis size is small enough that when using an iterative

eigensolver, there is no need to optimise the stretch basis.

Cybulski et al. calculate levels with and without Tﬁne. The two sets of levels are labelled

“no spin” and “with spin” in Table I. “No spin” levels with l0 > 0 are split into three closely

spaced ”with spin” levels. For their “no spin” levels Cybulski et al. use the dissociation

limit on their PES as the zero of energy. For their “with spin” levels they use a diﬀerent zero

of energy. The zero of energy for “with spin” is the experimental[33] energy of the lowest

rotational-spin NH(3Σ−) level. It is 0.0077 cm−1[32, 33] below the dissociation energy on the

PES. This 0.0077 cm−1 shift is due to Tﬁne. Our levels are compared to those of Cybulski et

al. in Table I. For both our “no spin” and our “with spin” levels, the zero of energy is the

dissociation limit. To compare Cybulski et al.’s and our “with spin” results, it is therefore

necessary to add -0.0077 cm−1 to the with spin energies in Ref. 32.

There is nearly perfect agreement between our levels and those of Ref. 32. Most diﬀerences

between our energy levels and their counterparts in Ref. 32 are less than 0.0001 cm−1 which is

the stated accuracy of Ref. 32. The three levels with l0 = 3 have larger diﬀerences. Both with

and without the spin term, our levels are lower by about 0.0014 cm−1. Gonz´alez-Mart´ınez

and Hutson[34] computed the same levels with the BOUND program[35] and also obtained

levels about 0.0014 cm−1 lower than those of Ref. 32. They attribute these diﬀerences to the

large r0 tails of the corresponding wavefunctions. Our calculation supports this observation

since we ﬁnd it is necessary to use a larger max(r0) = 35 a0 rather than 30 a0 of Ref. 32 to

converge these three levels.

Assigned values of l0 are also given in Table I. The l0 values are obtained from

l2
0

h

i

and

are close to l0(l0 + 1). Our l0 assignments agree with those of Ref. 32; they use L rather

than l0. Likewise, our J and parity assignments in Table I agree with those of Ref. 32. We

also give K, mS and mN1 assignments that are not in Ref. 32. Most of the reported bound

states can be assigned to K = 0 or 1. However, some are a mixture of K = 0 and 1 and

14

the corresponding K values are indicated as 0/1 or 1/0, with the ﬁrst number being the one

with the largest contribution to the wavefunction. Because the NH rotational constant is

large, all the states have N1 = 0. All calculated
has a shallow potential well (De = 19.84 cm−1) and states with N1 > 0 are not bound. Due

to the constraint, K = mS + mN1, mS assignments are the same as K assignments and

therefore mS assignments are not given in Table I. Finally,

j2

h

i

ranges from 2.002 to 2.005,

indicating that all levels are j(NH) = 1 states. j(NH) is a good quantum number because

spin is strongly coupled to NH rotation. As the potential well is shallow and the barrier to

NH rotation is low (3 to 4 cm−1)[32], we expect j to be a good quantum number.

Finally, NH(3Σ−)-He energy levels computed with method II (section VI ) and the same

basis sizes agree with those computed with method I to 9 decimal places (in cm−1). The

basis is evidently large enough that the levels are well converged despite the larger Coriolis

coupling of method II. When using an iterative eigensolver, basis size is not a problem. Since

the two methods deal with S2

ζ term diﬀerently, this excellent agreement indicates that both

methods are correct.

VIII. RESULTS: SPIN-ROVIBRATIONAL LEVELS OF O2(3Σ−

g )-AR

As mentioned previously, Tennyson and Mettes[10] computed O2(3Σ−

g )-Ar levels with a
variational method. In this paper, we use a PES more recent than the one used by Tennyson

and Mettes. The new PES is obtained using supermolecular unrestricted Moller-Plesset

perturbation theory[36]. This computer code for this PES was kindly provided to us by

Mark Severson and is deposited in the supplementary material of this paper. At equilibrium

the molecule is T-shaped with θ1e = 90◦ and r0e = 6.7a0[36]; the well depth is 117 cm−1. We

use atomic masses; for the rotational constant of O2 in its ground vibrational state[37] we
use bO2 = 1.437678 cm−1; λ0 = 1.98475 cm−1 and γ0 =

0.00845 cm−1 are, respectively, the

−

spin-spin and spin-rotation interaction constants for O2[37]. The bend basis size is deﬁned

by max(N1) = 25. Only odd rotational states of O2 are physically allowed and we therefore

include only basis functions with odd N1 values. 30 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are

used for θ1, to integrate the potential and in Eq. 19. The stretch basis for r0 is 120 sine DVR

[2] functions in the range [3.0, 35] a0. The O2 distance is ﬁxed throughout the calculation

15

as in the PES.[36]

To understand the pattern of the O2(3Σ−

g )-Ar levels, it is useful to discuss the O2 levels.

The N1 = 1 O2 rotational levels are split by the spin interaction term Tﬁne in Eq. (4) into

three levels. These three levels are from low to high, jO2 = 0, 2 and 1 levels, and are between
0 and 4 cm−1, determined by the value of λ0. Here jO2 is the total angular momentum

of O2. However, due to the anisotropy of the PES, jO2 is not a good quantum number in
O2(3Σ−

g )-Ar. Van der Avoird beautifully explained the results of Ref. 10 by using a simple
[12] Starting from the BF basis Eq. (7) and using perturbation theory, he noted

model.

that the positive coeﬃcient V2(r0) of the P2(cos θ) term in the potential expansion, which

is responsible for the T-shaped structure of the O2-X complex, pushes the mN1 = 0 levels

up relative to the mN1 =

1 levels by 3

5V2(r0)

±

12 cm−1. This is much larger than the

≈

magnitude of the splittings in free O2 caused by the spin interaction term Tﬁne. Here mN1

refers to the component of N1 along the BF z axis. Four lower-energy ”ladders” are built

on six zeroth-order states obtained from products of the two mN1 =

1 basis functions with

±

three spin function with mS = 0,

1. The rungs of two of the ladders are doublets. The

±

two components of each doublet have diﬀerent parity. Two of the ladders have K = 0, one

has K = 1, and one has K = 2. These four ladders are labelled i = 1, 2, 3 and 4.[12] Two

higher-energy ladders are built on three zeroth-order states that are products of the mN1 = 0

basis function and the three spin function with mS = 0,

1. One of these two ladders has

±

K = 0 and the other has K = 1. The rungs of the K = 1 ladder are doublets. These two

ladders are labelled i = 5 and 6.[12] No variational calculation for ladders i = 5 and i = 6

have been reported for O2(3Σ−

g )-Ar, but they have been reported for O2(3Σ−

g )-He.[11] The

characteristics of all six ladders are summarized in Table II.

Using wavefunctions, we assign K, mS and mN1 values to each level. These labels make

it possible to sort the levels we compute into Van der Avoird’s ladders. See Table III for

the ladders of assigned levels and Fig. 2 for an illustrative level diagram. Our four lower

ladders including their K, mS, mN1, and parity assignments agree well with those of Ref. 10,

shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. 12 (most of the variational levels were not published) even though

the potential energy surfaces are diﬀerent. The order of the even and odd doublets for the

K > 0 ladders order also agrees. The computed K, mS, mN1,

for each level are given in the Supplementary Material (SM). As discussed above, due to the

16

barrier to O2 internal rotation, coupling between N1 and l0 is more important than coupling

between S and N1, and as a consequence neither the total rotation angular momentum j

of the diatomic nor the end-over-end rotation angular momentum l0 are useful labels.

values are not close to l0(l0 + 1) , as they would be if l0 were a good quantum number,

however, they do increase as one moves up the ladder.

In contrast, l0 is almost a good

quantum number for NH-He because it is closer to the free rotor limit. Because the next O2

rotational level N1 = 3 is much higher in energy, all states shown are expected to have large

contributions from N1 = 1 basis functions. However,

The ladders of O2-Ar were recently used to analyse the level structure of CO-O2.[38] In

Ref. 38, CO-O2 energy levels were divided into two groups and a K = 0 ladder (referred to

as a stack in Ref. 38) in group 1 and a K = 2 ladder in group 2 were linked with the i = 1

ladder (K = 0) and the i = 2 ladder (K = 2) of O2-Ar. Groups and ladders are labelled

by n(O2), j(O2). However, Van der Avoird[12] clearly established that j(O2) is not a useful

label for O2-Ar. It seems likely that j(O2) is also not a useful label for CO-O2.

IX. RESULTS: SPIN-ROVIBRATIONAL LEVELS OF O2(3Σ−

g )-HE

We use an accurate PES determined with the partially spin-restricted open-shell single

and double excitation coupled cluster method with perturbative triples.[39] This is a 3-D

potential, but we ﬁx the O2 distance at the equilibrium value, r1e = 2.282a0. The potential
well depth is 27.9 cm−1 and the equilibrium geometry is T-shaped with θ1e = 90◦ and

r0e = 6.00a0[39]. Compared to O2-Ar, the O2-He potential well depth is much smaller

and the rare gas mass is much lighter. Therefore, O2-He states are more de-localized and

the Coriolis coupling has a bigger eﬀect on energy levels, which makes it more diﬃcult to

organize the levels into ladders. The Coriolis coupling is larger for O2(3Σ−
(see Eq. (1)) is larger. We use atomic masses and the same O2 parameters as for O2(3Σ−
The bend and stretch bases are the same as for O2(3Σ−

g )-Ar.

g )-He because B0

g )-Ar.

All of our calculated O2(3Σ−

g )-He bound states are given in Table IV. The ZPE is -7.47
cm−1, it sits about a quarter of the way up the well. In the same table, we also list the levels

computed by Tennyson and Van der Avoird[11] (TA) using a variational method[10] and an

17

older empirical PES[40]. The PES used by TA is certainly less accurate and its well depth

is only 23.5 cm−1. On their PES, TA found 35 bound states and on the newer PES we ﬁnd

only 28 bound states, even though the potential we use has a deeper well. Compared to

O2-Ar, the Coriolis coupling has a greater eﬀect on the energy levels. Many of the O2-He

states have more than one dominant K component. Moreover, a lot of states have more

than one dominant mN1. See Table IV. Because the ladders are deﬁned by K and mN1, the

mixing of these quantum numbers means that it is harder to identify states with ladders.

Tennyson and Van der Avoird[11] assigned ladder labels to their calculated levels by

comparing with the results of a perturbation model, but noted that the O2-He ladders were

less regular than those of O2-Ar. They observed, for the ﬁrst time, two higher ladders i = 5

and i = 6 with mN1 = 0 which they did not assign for O2-Ar. Using the newer PES, we

are also able to identify i = 5 and i = 6 ladders and ﬁnd that all the ladders are harder to

distinguish than for O2-Ar. This is due to the stronger Coriolis coupling. The simplest way

to assign a ladder label i to each of our levels is to compare our level list, for a ﬁxed J and

ﬁxed parity, to the assigned level list of TA and use their assignments for our levels. When

this is done we observe that gaps between levels in a ladder are sometimes irregular. This

means that the two PESs are diﬀerent enough that we cannot always use the assignments of
l2
0

to replace some of the TA labels attached

TA and we therefore use mN1, K,

h
to our levels. Once this is done the gaps between the rungs of the ladders become regular.

j2
O2i

and

h

i

See Fig. 3. These re-assigned levels are marked by a star in Table IV. The reassignments

exchange labels between ladders i = 4 and i = 6 and between ladders i = 1 and i = 2. One

type of reassignment is based on values of mN1. The i = 4 and i = 6 ladders have mN1 = 1
and 0, respectively. Thus, we reassign the the J = 1 odd state at -3.087 cm−1 which has mN1

= 0 to the i = 6 ladder. Another type of reassignment is based on values of K,
l2
0

. The rotation of O2 is less hindered in O2-He than in O2-Ar and therefore j = N1 + S,

h
is more nearly a good quantum number. One can therefore tentatively associate ladders

, and

i

h

j2
O2i

i = 2, 3, 4 with jO2 = 2 (5 components), ladders i = 5, 6 with jO2 = 1 (3 components), and

ladder i = 1 with jO2 = 0 (one component). The ladders then have the same energy order

as the states of O2 for which the rotational energy order is jO2 = 0, 2 and 1.

Another example of states that are reassigned is the two J = 3 even states at -4.703 and

-3.736 cm−1. They are re-assigned to the i = 2 and i = 1 ladders, respectively, for three

18

reasons. First, their

h
are 2.57 and 11.73, indicating l0 = 1 and 3.

i
If ladder i = 1 has jO2 = 0 then, because

h

are 5.90 and 0.38, indicating jO2 = 2 and 0. Second, their

j2
O2i

l2
0

J = jO2 + l0, J = l0 and therefore a J = 3 level must have l0 = 3 and hence belong to

ladder i = 1. Third, the K values of the two levels are 1/2/0 and 0 which also supports

this assignment because ladders i = 2 and i = 1 have K = 2 and 1. This example also

shows that due to the rotation of O2 being less hindered, l0 and jO2 are close to being good

quantum numbers for O2-He, whereas they are basically useless for O2-Ar, as discussed in

the previous section.

One serious problem in the ladder assignment occurs for the i = 5 ladder. The ﬁrst i = 5

state at -3.500 cm−1 is a pure K = 0 state as expected, but the next three i = 5 states

are all pure K = 1 states. States with diﬀerent values of K should not occur in the same

ladder. An illustrative level diagram for all the bound states of O2(3Σ−

g )-He is shown in Fig.

3. One can compare it with the same diagram in Ref. 11 and see that the ladder pattern

is quite diﬀerent. From Fig. 3, we see that level spacings between diﬀerent ladders are

rather diﬀerent, indicating diﬀerent values of end-over-end rotation constants. For all K > 0

ladders, we ﬁnd that the splitting between doublets of each rung is rather large, sometimes

larger than the J-spacings within the ladder, which is in stark contrast with the O2-Ar case.

X. CONCLUSION

In this paper we present a new approach for including the spin-spin term that couples

rotational angular momenta and electronic spin angular momentum. It is new in two ways.

First, it is new because it uses an iterative eigensolver to solve a matrix representation of the

Schroedinger equation. Second, it is new because it does not expand the potential in terms of

Legendre polynomials and use equations involving 3

j symbols to obtain matrix elements of

−

both the potential and the spin-spin term. Instead, quadrature is used for both and matrix-

vector products are done by evaluating sums sequentially. The method of this paper can be

used without expanding the potential and without employing angular momentum theory to

derive matrix elements. This makes it easy to use with a general PES.

One might think that using quadrature when it is possible to replace matrix elements

with exact closed-form equations would increase the cost of the calculation. This is not

19

true. It is not true for the same reason that the cost of the MVPs one must evaluate when

using quadrature for PES matrix elements and a SOP PES is the same. In some cases we

expect the new method to be cheaper. It is certainly cheaper if, when expanded in terms

of Legendre polynomials, the PES has many terms and also cheaper for molecules for which

the potential matrix is large. Moreover, if the molecule of the molecule-rare gas complex

were larger than a diatomic and if its shape was not ﬁxed, then the standard approach of

building and diagonalizing a matrix would be much more costly. Experiments have been

done on many O2 containing complexes, e.g. N2O-O2, H2O-O2, HF-O2 etc. The method of

this paper opens the door to doing calculations on these complexes.

TABLE IV: All bound spin-rovibrational levels of O2-He(3Σ−

g ) (in cm−1) relative to the dissociation

energy without Tf ine. TA refers to Tennyson and van der Avoird[11]. TW is This Work. To the

TA levels of Ref. 11, we have added 0.246 cm−1, the energy of the J = 1 O2 state, to account for

the diﬀerence in the deﬁnition of the zero of energy in this paper and in TA. All levels in this table

are below 0.246 cm−1 and are bound, except for one level at 0.248 cm−1.

FIG. 1: Two coupling schemes used for systems consisting of an open shell Σ diatomic molecule

and a closed shell atom, such as O2-Ar or NH-Ar. In scheme (a), the vector r0 is associated with the

intermonomer Jacobi vector. In scheme (b), the vector r0 is associated with the diatomic vector.

The z axes of the body-ﬁxed (BF) (marked in blue) and dimer-ﬁxed frames in both schemes are

along r0 and the x-axes of the BF frames are along r0 × r1 × r0.

based on the approximate quantum numbers K, mS, and mN1. The ﬁrst four ladders i = 1,

, 4

originate from mN1 = 1 states of O2. The next two ladders i = 5, 6 originate from mN1 = 0 states

of O2. Indicated with each level is J(e/o) where e/o is even/odd parity.
