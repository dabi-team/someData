Abstract

This paper continues the cycle of authors works on the detection
of precursors of large ﬂares (M5 and higher classes) in active regions
(ARs) of the Sun by their microwave radiation and magnetographic
characteristics. Generalization of the detected precursors of strong
ﬂares can be used to develop methods for their prediction. This paper
presents an analysis of the development of NOAA AR 12242, in which

an X1.8 ﬂare occurred on December 20, 2014. The analysis is based
on regular multiazimuth and multiwavelength observations with the
RATAN-600 radio telescope in the range 1.65-10 cm with intensity
and circular polarization analysis and data from the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). It was found that a new component appeared in
the AR microwave radiation two days before the X-ﬂare. It became
dominant in the AR the day before the ﬂare and signiﬁcantly decreased
after the ﬂare. The use of multiazimuth observations from RATAN-
600 and observations at 1.76 cm from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph
made it possible to identify the radio source that appeared before the
X-ﬂare with the site of the closest convergence of opposite polarity
ﬁelds near the neutral line in the AR. It was established that the X-
ﬂare occurred 20 h after the total gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld of the
entire region calculated from SDO/HMI data reached its maximum
value. Analysis of the evolution of the microwave source that appeared
before the X-ﬂare in AR 12242 and comparison of its parameters with
the parameters of other components of the AR microwave radiation
showed that the new source can be classiﬁed as neutral line associated
source (NLS), which were repeatedly detected by the RATAN-600 and
other radio telescopes 1-3 days before the large ﬂares.

INTRODUCTION

The method for predicting large ﬂares (the most energetic manifestations
of solar activity that aﬀect the near-Earth space and terrestrial atmosphere
(Benz, 2017)) can be based on facts found in diﬀerent solar radiation ranges
that indicate the accumulation of energy and the preparation of the active
region (AR) for a large ﬂare (mainly, by the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration and
its variation), as well as by such features as the spatiotemporal distribution
of weak ﬂares (”precursor ﬂares”) that accompany a large ﬂare (Gyenge et
al., 2016).

In recent decades, studies have shown that ﬂares mostly occur in ARs with
a complex magnetic structure, predominantly with a δ-conﬁguration with a
wavy neutral line and high ﬁeld gradients. The researchers have come to
such conclusions by analyzing the data of the GOES, RHESSI, SOHO/MDI,
SDO (AIA and HMI), and other space observatories. Several reviews of
active solar events with large ﬂares of M5 and higher classes (based on X-ray
classiﬁcation) based on the databases of space observatories have recently

2

been published. In these papers, the analysis of individual active events is
generalized, and a large number of events with large ﬂares are statistically
analyzed in order to identify the characteristic features in AR development,
i.e., precursors of large ﬂares and CMEs (Schwijer et al., 2016; Harra et
al., 2016; Turiumi et al., 2017).
It has been established that, in the vast
majority of cases, large ﬂares can be predicted by the emergence of a new
magnetic ﬂux, the presence of a strongﬁeld, high-gradient polarity inversion
line (SHIL), motions of magnetic ﬂuxes, shear generation, sunspot rotation,
and the occurrence of electric currents in the AR.

Important information about the accumulation of energy and an upcom-
ing large ﬂare in the AR can be provided by microwave observations of the
Sun. The ﬁrst evidence of the relationship between the features of the AR mi-
crowave radiation structure and its ﬂare activity were obtained in the 1970s.
Thus, during observations of the solar eclipse on March 7, 1970, a group
of Pulkovo radio astronomers found an intense, compact, and weakly polar-
ized radio source at 4.5 cm in the ﬂare-active group over the region between
sunspots (Quinones et al., 1975).
In 1974, observations with the Wester-
bork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at a wavelength of 6 cm revealed
a quasi-stationary bright source that was projected on the region near the
neutral line of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld (neutral line associated source,
NLS) (Kundu et al., 1977). Subsequent observations of the three ARs with
the WSRT in May 1980 conﬁrmed that there were intense sources (NLSs)
associated with X-ray loops over the neutral line and that one of them had
intensiﬁed several hours before a large ﬂare (Kundu and Alissandrakis, 1984).
From then on, radio observations of the Sun by large instruments (the
RATAN-600, Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), and Siberian solar radio
telescope (SSRT)), as well as radio observations of solar eclipses, showed that
the characteristic feature of ARs with high ﬂare activity is the presence of
microwave NLSs. Regular observations of the Sun with the RATAN-600,
which started in 1975 in a wide microwave range, made it possible to ﬁnd
that microwave sources appeared and developed quickly before large ﬂares
in ARs. These sources were identiﬁed by the sites of the maximum gradient
of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld near the neutral line, which often became
the dominant component in the AR microwave radiation. The characteris-
tics of these radio sources (the steep slope of the ﬂux density spectrum of
in the range 2-4 cm, low polarization degree (not more than 30%), small
angular sizes, and high brightness temperature) distinguished these sources
from other well-studied AR microwave radiation components associated with

3

sunspots, ﬂocculi, and coronal condensations. That is why these sources
are called peculiar sources (see, for example, (Akhmedov et al., 1986, 1989;
Borovik et al., 1989a, b)). Korzhavin et al. (1989) suggested that peculiar
sources are connected with strong currents (current sheets) in the atmosphere
of ﬂare ARs.

Joint observations of a number of ARs with the WSRT and RATAN-600
at wavelengths of 2-6 cm in May 1980 showed that NLSs observed with the
WSRT and peculiar sources observed with the RATAN-600 are the same ob-
jects (Alissandrakis et al., 1993). Subsequently, compact intense microwave
sources identiﬁed with the NL of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld or regions
near the NL were called NLSs. Such sources are recognized as typical (often,
dominant) components of the microwave radiation (of mainly ﬂare) ARs with
a complex magnetic structure (Shibasaki et al., 2011). The nature of NLSs
has been investigated (Yasnov, 2014).

Observations of the Sun with the NoRH at a wavelength of 1.76 cm and
with the SSRT at 5.2 cm revealed bright quasistationary sources above the
neutral line in ARs in which there were large ﬂares and large CMEs, in
particular, those that caused the GLE (Uralov et al., 2000; 2006; 2008). The
studied NLSs at a wavelength of 1.76 cm were identiﬁed by their location on
or near the neutral line of the vertical component of the coronal magnetic
ﬁeld at the point where the horizontal component has an absolute or local
maximum. It was found that NLSs are connected with the AR energy release
sites, and it was concluded that the microwave radiation of large ﬂares starts
under the coronal current sheet in magnetic loops, the bases of which are in
the area of motions of strong photospheric ﬁelds.

Studies of microwave characteristics of a number of ARs with high ﬂare
activity continued with the RATAN-600 in 2011-2015, and the analysis of the
AR characteristics by SDO data (Abramov-Maximov et al., 2015a, b) showed
that, in the studied ARs, a new (in most cases, dominant) microwave source
(NLS) was detected 1-2 days before X class ﬂares (according to the GOES
classiﬁcation) in the AR microwave radiation, which was associated with
the site of the maximum gradient of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld near
the neutral line. The evolution of this source was similar to the magnetic
ﬁeld gradient evolution. Analysis of the magnetic measurements of the same
ARs by the SDO data showed that X-class ﬂares occurred at suﬃciently high
magnetic ﬂux levels in sunspot groups (F ∼ 1022 Mx) and at a sharp increase
in the magnetic ﬁeld gradient, which reﬂected the geometric approach of
opposite polarity sunspots.

This paper continues the cycle of authors works on the detection of the
precursors of large ﬂares (M5 and higher classes) in ARs of the Sun by their
microwave radiation and magnetographic characteristics. Generalization of
the detected precursors of strong ﬂares can be used to develop methods for
their prediction. Analysis of the development of AR NOAA 12242, in which
an X1.8 ﬂare occurred on December 20, 2014, is presented. The analysis is
based on regular observations of the Sun in the microwave range with the
RATAN-600 radio telescope. Magnetographic characteristics of ARs were
studied based on SDO/HMI data.

2 RATAN-600 OBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN

In this paper, we used the results of daily multiazimuth spectral-polarization
multiwavelength observations of the Sun carried out with the RATAN-600
radio telescope in the selected wavelength range of (1.8-4.0) cm. Observa-
tions were conducted with a multioctave high-resolution spectral-polarization
complex (Bogod et al., 2011).

The knife-edge beam at a wavelength of 2.0 cm (HPBW) is 17(cid:48)(cid:48) × 13(cid:48). In
December 2014, observations of the Sun on RATAN-600 were carried out in
multiazimuth mode, i.e., 31 observations were conducted daily in diﬀerent
azimuths in the time interval of 06:50-11:30 UT, while the Sun scanning angle
by the antenna beam varied within ±14.5 deg. (Bogod et al., 2004). This
observation method made it possible both to investigate the dynamics of the
development of individual microwave radiation components of AR 12242 for
more than 4 h and to carry out their two-dimensional identiﬁcation with
parts of the AR.

An example of the results of observations of the Sun with the RATAN-
600 on December 18, 2014, in one of the 31 azimuths is given in Fig. 1. The
considered AR 12242 is in the right part of the disk, and AR 12241 is in
the left part. In Fig. 1, solid lines indicate 7 one-dimensional scans in the
intensity channel (Stokes parameter I) in the order of increasing wavelengths
given on the left (in cm). The dashed lines show scans in the polarization
channel (Stokes parameter V) in two wavelengths (2.0 and 2.2 cm). The
scans are superimposed on the image of the Sun (SDO). AR 12241 was used
to control the referencing of scans to the image of the Sun.

The parameters of individual components of the radio emission of the
considered AR 12242 were estimated by the Gauss analysis by the method

5

of processing of solar scans obtained with the RATAN- 600 (Akhmedov et
al., 1987) using the WorkScan software (Garaimov, 1997). The radio source
ﬂuxes identiﬁed on one-dimensional solar scans were calibrated with the use
of the results of observations of standard objects (the Moon and the Crab
Nebula) with the RATAN-600 and also with an accounting of the data of the
world solar patrol.

3 RESULTS OF OBSERVATION OF AR 12242

WITH THE RATAN-600

AR 12242 was ﬁrst detected on the disk on December 14, 2014, as a group
of sunspots with an area of 100 msh (millionths of the solar hemisphere)
(according The Preliminary Report and Forecast of Solar Geophysical Data,
ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/swpc products/weekly reports/PRFs of SGD).
As the group moved by the disk, it developed; its area increased and reached
a maximum value of 1080 msh on December 19. From December 15 to 17,
a number of C-class ﬂares and two M-class ﬂares were detected in it (one
of them was a large M8.7 ﬂare on December 17 (peak at 04:42 UT)). Un-
fortunately, it is impossible to identify the precursors of this ﬂare because
of the AR closeness to the eastern limb in the period until December 17.
Therefore, in this paper, the task is to investigate the evolution of the AR
12242 microwave radiation and its magnetographic characteristics before the
large X1.8 ﬂare (beginning at 00:11 UT, peak at 00:28 UT, and end at 00:55
UT) for December 17-20.

Figure 2 shows fragments of solar scans (RATAN-600) at several wave-
lengths identiﬁed with the AR 12242 image in white light and magnetograms
(SDO/HMI) for December 16220, 2014. It can be seen that, two days before
the X-ﬂare, new components appeared in the AR microwave radiation struc-
ture, one of which (designated as 2) became the dominant component a day
before the ﬂare. After the ﬂare, it noticeably decreased.

The identiﬁcation of AR microwave radiation components based on ob-
servations with the RATAN-600 in diﬀerent azimuths with diﬀerent position
angles of the Sun showed that source 2 is uniquely identiﬁed with the region
near the neutral line, where the negative polarity ﬁeld came close to the pre-
viously existing positive polarity ﬁeld (in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4b, it is marked by
arrow 2). Source 3 is identiﬁed by multiazimuth observations with a region

6

covering the southern part of the large negative polarity sunspot in the tail
part of the group and the region near the neutral line, where the negative
polarity ﬁeld also came close to the positive polarity ﬁeld (indicated in Fig.
2 and Fig. 4b by arrow 3).

Solar radio images at a wavelength of 1.76 cm obtained with the Nobeyama
Radioheliograph were used for more reliable identiﬁcation of microwave sources
with a magnetogram. In Fig. 3a, radio images of NOAA ARs 12241 and
12242 at 1.76 cm on December 19 are superimposed on the magnetogram
(SDO/HMI). The white solid isolines show the intensity (Stokes parameter
I), and the dashed lines indicate circular polarization (Stokes parameter V):
the white lines refer to positive polarization, and black refer to negative po-
larization. The leading (head) sunspot of AR 12241 was used to control the
coordinate referencing of the radio image and the magnetogram.

Figure 3a shows that the radiation maximum at 1.76 cm coincides with
region 2 in Fig. 2 near the neutral line, i.e., with the site of maximum
convergence of the magnetic ﬁelds with the opposite polarity sign. Region
3 near the neutral line to the south of the tail sunspot (see Fig. 2), where
opposite polarity ﬁelds also converged, is also located in the high radiation
intensity region at a wavelength of 1.76 cm.

Thus, the identiﬁcation of intense microwave sources detected on the
RATAN-600 (one day before the ﬂare) with the sites of convergence of oppo-
site polarity ﬁelds near the neutral line agrees with the results of observations
on the NoRH at 1.76 cm.

It is important to note that the X1.8 ﬂare (beginning at 00:11 UT and
peak at 00:28 UT) began to develop on December 20 exactly in this region
of the neutral line of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld, where the ﬁelds of
opposite signs converge. This can be seen in Fig. 3b, where the image of the
AR 12242 in the line 1600 (SDO) is given at 00:17:29 UT on December 20.

4 MAGNETOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATIONS

OF AR 12242

This paper presents the results of the analysis of the structure and magnetic
characteristics of sunspots in AR 12242 for December 1721, 2014, according
to SDO data. The SDO/HMI data was analyzed with an accumulation time
of 45 s at 00:00, 05:00, 10:00, 15:00, and 20:00 UT. Automatic identifying

7

of sunspots and measurement of the magnetic ﬂux in them by SDO/HMI
observations in the continuum and in magnetographic observations was used
(Tlatov et al., 2014).

The method for calculating the index of solar ﬂares used in this paper can
be described in the following steps. At the ﬁrst step, the boundaries of ARs
with diﬀerent polarities were determined. For this purpose, structures with
a magnetic ﬁeld above the threshold values (±500 G) were selected on the
HMI/SDO magnetograms. The eﬀective distance between the boundaries of
the regions was then determined.

In order to simplify computational algorithms, only distance data in the
horizontal and vertical directions were taken into account. At the ﬁrst step
of the algorithm, vertical scanning was carried out. Thus, when scanning
the current column, the positive region boundary (point i) was found. Next,
the total positive polarity magnetic ﬂux Φl
pos was determined. The pixels
were scanned from point i by the column until the ﬁrst boundary point of
the negative region (point j) was detected. After point j was found, it was
taken into account that this point belonged to the negative region, and the
ﬂux of this region was Φk
neg. If no such point was detected, then the given
point i was no longer considered.

Next, the distance between the points i and j dij =

(Θi − Θj)2 + (ϕi − ϕj)2

(cid:113)

was determined, where Θ and ϕ are the latitude and longitude of the points
i and j. If the distance dij was greater than the threshold value dmax = 5deg,
then this pair was not considered further. The current gradient gradij =
(Φl
neg)/dij was then calculated. The index gradij was summed to
determine the total index of bipole moments (ﬂare index).

pos + Φk

In Fig. 2, magnetograms show how the conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld
in AR 12242 changed from December 16 to 20: on December 18, a negative
polarity ﬁeld appeared to the south of the tail sunspot near the positive
polarity ﬁeld that existed on the previous day. Simultaneously, a negative
polarity ﬁeld westwardly approached the positive polarity ﬁeld along the
neutral line. The next day, on December 19, the opposite polarity ﬁelds
got as close as possible at two sites near the neutral line (at points 2 and 3
marked by the corresponding arrows). On December 20, after the X1.8 ﬂare,
the negative polarity ﬁeld at point 2 departed from the positive polarity ﬁeld,
while at point 3 the negative polarity ﬁeld remained near the positive polarity
ﬁeld (see also Fig. 4c).

The magnetographic characteristics of the entire AR 12242 and speciﬁc

8

regions 2 and 3 near the neutral line calculated based on the SDO/HMI data
as described above are shown in Fig. 5, where the graphs of development of
the total bipole moment index INDEX for the whole AR and magnitudes of
gradients GRAD in separate regions 2 and 3 are given. A similar behavior
in the development of both the total index and the gradients in both regions
for the period from December 17 to 20 can be observed: the total index
and gradients increase two days before the X-ﬂare, and, after they pass a
maximum (15-20 h before the ﬂare), there is a decline before the X-ﬂare.

In Fig. 4, the crosses on the AR magnetograms indicate the positions
of the maximum gradient at times 02:29:39 and 02:59:09 UT. Calculations
carried out with an interval of 1030 min showed that, for the entire considered
period starting from December 18, the maximum gradient in diﬀerent time
intervals for a long time was either in region 2 or in region 3. However, on
December 19, the maximum gradient sites were alternately in regions 2 or
3, which is evident in the above examples on the magnetograms in Fig. 4a
and 4b obtained with an interval of 30 min. After the X-ﬂare on December
20, the gradient maximum was stably in region 3, and the gradient at point
2 decreased signiﬁcantly. The negative polarity ﬁeld moved away from the
positive polarity ﬁeld, and its intensity decreased by 20%.

5 ANALYSIS OF MICROWAVE OBSERVA-

TIONS OF AR 12242

Let us consider the evolution of individual components of the microwave ra-
diation of AR 12242 for December 17-20. Figure 5 shows changes in the
intensity of individual components of AR microwave radiation in four days.
Figures 5a and 5b show the intensities at 2.36 cm and 3.45 cm of microwave
sources 2 (panel (a)) and 3 (panel (b)) expressed in antenna temperatures
Ta over the observation periods with the RATAN-600 (daily in time inter-
vals from 07:00 to 11:30 UT). In Fig. 5c, the evolution of source 3 at the
wavelengths of 2.2, 2.36, 2.75, and 3.45 cm for December 18 is given in more
detail. Here, in the upper part of the ﬁgure, the bolder line shows the change
in the integral ﬂux of the radio emission from the Sun at a wavelength of 3.2
cm according to observations at Mountain (Kislovodsk) Astronomical Sta-
tion of the Pulkovo observatory. Vertical lines indicate the moments of radio
observations in diﬀerent azimuths. The thicker line corresponds to the obser-

9

vation time at the local noon. Figure 5c clearly shows a high correlation of
variations in the intensity of the sources at all the given waves with variations
in the integral ﬂux of the Sun, which is due to microwave bursts associated
with ﬂares in AR 12242. A similar conclusion was drawn via comparison of
variations in the intensity of sources 2 and 3 during observations with the
RATAN-600 with variations in the integral ﬂux of the Sun on other days.

Comparison of the evolution of the intensity of the sources that developed
before the X-ﬂare with the development of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient in the
regions near the neutral line with which they are identiﬁed (at points 2 and 3
in Fig. 2) is of particular interest. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, the evolution
of source 2 (in particular, at 3.45 cm wavelength) reﬂects the evolution of
the gradient 2 for December 18-20. Simultaneously, the intensity of source
3 changed insigniﬁcantly for the same period. This can be explained by the
fact that the radiation of the sunspot microwave source associated with the
tail sunspot of the group and, possibly, of the source generated near the
neutral line associated with gradient 3 simultaneously entered a knife-edge
antenna pattern. Apparently, the sunspot source radiation dominated, and
it was quite stable (if we take into account that the ﬁeld intensity in the tail
spot for December 18-20 did not change by more than 10%).

The characteristics of the individual components of the microwave radi-
ation of AR 12242 obtained from observations with the RATAN-600 were
analyzed. Particular attention was paid to a comparison of the parameters
of sources 2 and 3, the most intense microwave sources in the AR emission
that were detected before the X1.8 ﬂare (see Fig. 2).

Figure 6a shows the spectra of source ﬂux densities for diﬀerent observa-
tion days. By comparing the spectra of the sources obtained on December 19
(for the times when there were no microwave bursts on the Sun), two main
diﬀerences can be noted:

(a) In the short-wave part (at waves shorter than 2.5 cm), the source 2

spectrum slope is greater than that of source 3.

(b) In the case of the complete coincidence of the ﬂuxes of both sources
in the range of 2.5-3.2 cm, a diﬀerence in the ﬂuxes (by 60%) on longer waves
(about 4 cm) can be seen. If the angular sizes of both sources are close (as
can be seen from the structure of the AR on short wavelengths), it can be
assumed that the brightness temperatures of source 2 at wavelengths of about
4 cm are higher than those of source 3. However, it is impossible to reliably
determine the brightness temperature of sources at wavelengths of about 4
cm because of the insuﬃcient antenna resolution and, accordingly, because

10

In
it is impossible to determine unambiguously the sizes of the sources.
this case, it can be stated that the brightness temperatures of the sources at
wavelengths shorter than 3 cm are close and that they are about (3 − 4) × 106
K at wavelengths longer than 3 cm.

Table 1 shows the spectral indices of the sources determined in the wave-

length range of 1.8-2.5 cm according to observations on diﬀerent days.

The spectrum of source 2 has the largest spectral index. The spectrum
of source 3 has a smaller spectral index, which can be explained by the
fact that the ﬂux of source 3 was composed of the dominant ﬂux of the
sunspot source associated with a large tail sunspot and probably an existing
source associated with the formed magnetic ﬁeld gradient near the neutral
line. However, when observing with a knife-edge antenna pattern, one cannot
separate the radiation from these sources.

The spectrum of source 3 for December 17 reﬂects the total radiation of
only two sunspot sources associated with large sunspots in the tail of the
group (as seen in Fig. 2, the magnetic ﬁeld gradient near the neutral line
has not yet formed on this day). On December 20, the spectrum of the weak
source remaining after the X-ﬂare also has a low spectral index. Note that
the gradient decreased signiﬁcantly after the X-ﬂare in this region near the
neutral line as compared to what it was the day before the ﬂare on December
19.

A comparison of the spectra of polarization degrees for sources 2 and 3
is presented in Fig. 5b. It can be seen that the polarization degree of source
2 is smaller than polarization degrees of source 3.

Thus, the main features by which the characteristics of microwave source
2 turned out to be diﬀerent from these of source 3, in which the sunspot
radiation prevails, were as follows: a steeper spectral slope (large spectral
index) in the short-wavelength part of the centimeter range, small angular
sizes comparable with the size of sunspot source, and a smaller polarization
degree. Taking into account the fact that source 2 is identiﬁed with the site
of the closest convergence of opposite polarity ﬁelds, i.e., with the site of the
maximum gradient of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld near the neutral line,
all of the above radio characteristics make it possible to attribute it to NLSs,
which were repeatedly observed before large ﬂares.

6 CONCLUSIONS

The results were presented for a study of the evolution of the microwave radi-
ation and the magnetographic characteristics of NOAA AR 12242, in which
there was a X1.8 ﬂare on December 20, 2014 (according to the GOES classiﬁ-
cation). The analysis was carried out to identify the precursors of a large ﬂare
in the microwave range based on daily multiwavelength spectral-polarization
observations of the Sun in the 1.6510 cm range with the RATAN-600 radio
telescope. SDO/HMI data were used to analyze the AR magnetographic
characteristics.

Two days before the ﬂare, the development of a new microwave source
was detected; it became the dominant component in the AR radio emission
the day before the X-ﬂare and signiﬁcantly decreased after the ﬂare. It was
found that the new source was identiﬁed with the site of the closest con-
vergence of opposite polarity ﬁelds near the neutral line of the photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld. Magnetographic studies of AR 12242 showed that, during
the development of the group, opposite polarity ﬁelds converged in the AR
and strong gradients were formed near the neutral line, i.e., two days before
the ﬂare, a so-called it SHIL (strong-ﬁeld, high-gradient polarity inversion
line) formed in the AR that is now recognized by many researchers as the
clearest AR precursor for a large ﬂare (Schwijer et al., 2016; Harra et al.,
2016; Turiumi et al., 2017).

The study of the evolution of the total gradient (ﬂare index) of AR 12242
showed that, before the X-ﬂare, the index ﬁrst increased and then, after the
maximum was passed (20 h before the ﬂare), decreased before the X ﬂare.
Note that a similar conclusion was made by Korsos et al. (2014, 2015), who
analyzed the parameters of sunspot groups in a number of ﬂare regions and
found that there is usually a sharp increase in the magnetic ﬁeld gradient
before large ﬂares that reaches a high maximum, followed by its decrease just
before the ﬂare.

The identiﬁcation of a microwave source that developed before the large
ﬂare with the site of the maximum gradient of the AR photospheric ﬁeld near
the neutral line and the parameters of its radio emission makes it possible to
classify it as an NLS that was detected before ﬂares in early solar observations
with the RATAN-600, and were revealed as precursors of large ﬂares in the
analysis of a number of active events in 2011-2015 based on data from the
RATAN-600 and SDO (Abramov-Maximov et al., 2015a,b).

The results make it possible to conclude that regular radio observations

12

of the Sun in the microwave range can be used to identify precursors of large
ﬂares, based on which methods for their prediction can be developed.
