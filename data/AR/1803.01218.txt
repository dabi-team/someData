ABSTRACT. The treatment of atomic anions with Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) 

has long been controversial since the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy, EHOMO, 

is  often  calculated  to  be  positive  with  most  approximate  density  functionals.  We  assess  the 

accuracy of orbital energies and electron affinities for all three rows of elements in the periodic 

table (H-Ar) using a variety of theoretical approaches and customized basis sets. Among all of the 

theoretical methods studied here, we find that a non-empirically tuned range-separated approach 

(constructed to satisfy DFT-Koopmans’ theorem for the anionic electron system) provides the best 

accuracy for a variety of basis sets – even for small basis sets where most functionals typically 

fail. Previous approaches to solve this conundrum of positive EHOMO values have utilized non-self-

consistent methods; however electronic properties, such as electronic couplings/gradients (which 

require  a  self-consistent  potential  and  energy),  become  ill-defined  with  these  approaches.  In 

contrast,  the  non-empirically  tuned  range-separated  procedure  used  here  yields  well-defined 

electronic  couplings/gradients  and  correct  EHOMO  values  since  both  the  potential  and  resulting 

electronic  energy  are  computed  self-consistently.  Orbital  energies  and  electron  affinities  are 

further  analyzed  in  the  context  of  the  electronic  energy  as  a  function  of  electronic  number 

(including fractional numbers of electrons) to provide a stringent assessment of self-interaction 

errors for these complex anion systems. 

 
 
 
 
Introduction 

The quantum mechanical description of weakly-bound anions and their unusual properties 

continues  to  garner  immense  interest  in  the  atomic/molecular  physics  and  condensed-phase 

chemistry  communities.  In  particular,  the  weak  binding  of  an  extra  electron  to  a  stable  neutral 

atom/molecule is central to the study of Rydberg states,1-3 few-body quantum systems,4 and their 

couplings  to  the  electronic  continuum.5-7  Within  the  rapidly-growing  field  of  condensed-phase 

chemistry, loosely-bound electrons are present as solvated electrons in which an extra electron is 

not  associated  to  any  one  particular  molecule  but  is  collectively  bound  by  a  cluster  of  solvent 

molecules.8-10 In the broader fields of chemistry and materials science, anions and radicals play a 

vital  role  in  semiconducting  molecular  clusters,11,  12  fullerenes,13,  14  charge  transfer,15  and  solar 

cells.16, 17 

To  describe  these  highly  complex  processes  and  electronic  environments,  an  accurate 

quantum mechanical treatment is necessary, and advances in density functional theory (DFT) have 

enabled first-principles  calculations with reasonable accuracy (mean absolute errors around 0.2 

eV).18 However, during the formative stages of DFT in quantum chemistry, serious concerns were 

raised that Kohn-Sham DFT was not appropriate for the study of anions since the highest occupied 

molecular orbital (HOMO) energy was often calculated to be positive – typically for small basis 

sets, and surprisingly for atomic species with sizeable electron affinities.19-23 A positive HOMO 

eigenvalue is problematic since this implies that the anion is unbound, and the calculation is, in 

principle,  unreliable.24  At  the  time,  these  problematic  cases  were  shown  to  arise  from  the 

deficiency of LDA/GGA exchange-correlation functionals since Kohn-Sham potentials obtained 

from these approximations exhibit the wrong asymptotic behavior.25 Still, other researchers have 

argued that electron affinities calculated using reasonable basis sets (even with these conventional 

 
 
 
DFT methods) are still reliable when calculated as a difference between the self-consistent total 

energies of the anion and neutral species.26 These controversial issues continue to interest DFT 

purists, and recent parallel studies by Burke27 and Jensen28 have demonstrated that anions which 

should  be  bound  states  in  reality  are  actually  described  as  metastable  electronic  resonances  by 

many approximate DFT methods. Burke and co-workers27 have attributed these discrepancies to 

strong self-interaction errors (SIEs) that arise from a net negative charge, resulting in an effective 

potential where the last electron is actually unbound. 

Numerous publications have appeared using DFT methods to calculate electron affinities18, 

29-31 (including recent developments in extended Koopmans’ Theorem approaches32-34), and three 

solutions have been proposed to address the conundrum of positive EHOMO values in Kohn-Sham 

DFT: (1) Ignore warnings on positive HOMO energies:18 This viewpoint is a pragmatic approach 

to simply “march on” and compute electron affinities as energy differences between the anion and 

neutral  species;  however,  the  presence  of  a  formally  problematic,  positive  HOMO  energy  is 

unsettling since one “obtains the right answer for the wrong reason”; (2) Use an orbital-dependent 

self-interaction  correction  scheme:35,  36  This  approach  can,  in  principle,  directly  eliminate  SIE 

terms in an orbital-by-orbital procedure; however, a detailed study by Scuseria and co-workers23 

has  shown  that  these  self-interaction  corrections  can  severely  impair  equilibrium  properties,  in 

addition to introducing computational difficulties due to the invariance of the energy with respect 

to unitary transformations; (3) Self-consistently compute orbitals using Hartree-Fock (HF), but 

use the HF density to non-self-consistently evaluate the energy with DFT:27, 37 While this most 

recently  proposed  approach  will  formally  result  in  a  bound  anion  with  a  negative  EHOMO,  the 

calculation of electronic properties, such as electronic couplings or gradients, becomes ill-defined 

 
 
 
since  the  potential  is  evaluated  with  one  approach  while  the  energy  is  non-self-consistently 

evaluated with another approximation. 

In this  work, we instead propose the  following alternative:  use a non-empirically  tuned 

procedure to satisfy DFT-Koopmans’ theorem for the anionic (N+1) electron system, and use the 

resulting  tuned  XC  functional  to  self-consistently  evaluate  both  orbital  energies  and  electron 

affinities.  This  procedure  should  yield  correct  EHOMO  values  and  well-defined  electronic 

couplings/gradients  since  both  the  potential  and  resulting  electronic  energy  are  computed  self-

consistently. We test the accuracy of this approach by computing both the orbital  energies and 

electron affinities for all three rows of elements in the periodic table (H-Ar). We have chosen to 

focus our attention on individual atoms since SIEs are particularly severe for isolated atoms where 

the extra electron is strongly localized.38 A variety of theoretical methods and extremely diffuse, 

customized basis sets are used in this work (containing exponents less than 10-10), which require 

special modifications to existing codes to achieve convergence at the basis set limit. Finally, we 

examine the orbital energies and electron affinities in the context of the electronic energy, E, as a 

function  of  electronic  number,  N,  including  fractional  numbers  of  electrons.39  These  tests  of 

deviations  from  linearity  provide  a  stringent  assessment  of  SIEs  inherent  to  the  underlying 

functional itself as well as a critical diagnostic of the basis set used in the calculation.40 We give a 

detailed analysis of these E vs. N curves and discuss the implications of using a non-empirically 

tuned  approach  for  obtaining  accurate  and  formally-correct  bound  anions  with  well-defined 

electronic properties in a fully self-consistent approach. 

 
 
 
 
Theory and Methodology 

The main purpose of this work is to (1) assess the accuracy of non-empirically tuned range-

separated  DFT  and  (2)  understand  the  effects  of  non-standard,  extremely  diffuse  basis  sets  for 

simultaneously computing electron affinities and orbital energies for anions – both of which are 

briefly reviewed here. 

Non-Empirically  Tuned  Range-Separated  DFT.  In  contrast  to  conventional  hybrid 

functionals, the range-separated formalism24, 25 mixes short range density functional exchange with 

long range Hartree-Fock exchange by partitioning the electron repulsion operator into short and 

long range terms (i.e., the mixing parameter is a function of electron coordinates): 

(1) 

The  erf  term  denotes  the  standard  error  function,  r12  is  the  interelectronic  distance  between 

electrons 1 and 2, and µ is the range-separation parameter in units of Bohr-1. The second term in 

Eq.  (1)  is  of  particular  importance  since  it  enforces  a  rigorously  correct  100%  contribution  of 

asymptotic HF exchange, which we41-45 and others46, 47 have found to be essential for accurately 

describing long-range charge-transfer excitations, orbital energies, and valence excitations in even 

relatively simple molecular systems. For pure density functionals (such as the generalized gradient 

BLYP used here or the PBE kernel) which do not already include a fraction of nonlocal Hartree-

Fock exchange, the exchange-correlation (XC) energy within the range-separated formalism is 

(2) 

 is the DFT correlation functional, 

 is the short-range DFT exchange functional, and 

 is  the  Hartree-Fock  contribution  to  exchange  computed  with  the  long-range  part  of  the 

Coulomb operator.  Baer and Kronik48, 49 have shown that the range-separation parameter,  µ, is

system dependent but can be non-empirically tuned to satisfy DFT-Koopmans’ theorem.50-52 In 

summary, this theorem states that the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) 

equals  the  negative  of  the  ionization  potential  (IP);  the  latter  is  typically  obtained  from  the 

difference of two separate energy calculations via a ΔSCF procedure. Within the Kohn-Sham DFT 

formalism, this condition is fulfilled for the exact XC-functional; therefore, adjusting the range-

separation  parameter  in  this  self-consistent  manner  provides  a  theoretical  justification  for  this 

procedure. While the original non-empirical tuning procedure focused on computing the HOMO 

and IP for neutral systems, we have slightly modified this procedure to non-empirically compute 

electron affinities and orbital energies of anions by minimizing the following objective function:  

where 

 is the HOMO energy of the anionic (N + 1)-electron system and 

(3) 

 is 

the electron affinity computed via a ΔSCF energy difference between the N and N + 1 electron 

systems with the same range-separation parameter: 

. Note that the 

electron affinity, 

, used in this work is defined as a positive number, which is the same 

convention used by Jensen,28 Burke,27 and Tozer40 in their previous studies of electron affinities. 

It should also be noted that with this definition, the electron affinity of the N-electron system is 

equal to the ionization potential of the (N + 1)-electron system (i.e. 

), so 

the objective function in Eq. (3) is a non-empirical approach to satisfy DFT-Koopmans’ theorem 

for  anions.  To  obtain  the  optimal  µ  values  for  each  oligomer,  several  single-point  energy 

calculations for each of the individual anions were carried out by varying  μ from 0.1 to 0.6 (in 

increments of 0.05) for each of the N and N – 1 electron states. The objective function, 𝐽2 (Eq. 3), 

()()()22HOMO1EA,JNN=++()HOMO1N+()EAN()()()EA1NENEN=−+()EAN()()EAIP1NN=+ 
 
 
  
was computed as a function of µ for each anion, and spline interpolation was subsequently used to 

refine the minimum for each individual system. 

Non-Standard, Extremely Diffuse Basis Sets. Throughout this work, we compare two 

basis sets for computing the electron affinities and orbital energies in atomic anions: a conventional 

aug-pc-2 basis53 (a triple-zeta quality basis augmented with diffuse functions) and a customized 

diffuse  basis  set  which  we  denote  as  aug-pc-∞.  Following  the  same  approach  as  Jensen,28  this 

customized aug-pc-∞ basis set was constructed by adding both diffuse s- and p- functions to the 

aug-pc-4 basis by scaling the outer exponent in a geometric progression with a factor of √10 until 

the exponent of the most diffuse function became less than 10-10. Furthermore, we have used the 

aug-pc-2 and aug-pc-∞ basis sets in their uncontracted forms to avoid any possible contraction 

errors. The uncontracted basis sets for all the anions are listed in the Supporting Information for 

completeness. As demonstrated by Jensen,28 calculations with extremely diffuse basis functions of 

this magnitude pose a variety of numerical issues that  standard settings in many computational 

chemistry  codes  are  not  capable  of  handling.  As  such,  all  calculations  were  carried  out  with  a 

locally modified version of the Gaussian 09 package54 specifically tailored to handle these non-

standard,  extremely  diffuse  basis  sets.  Specifically,  all  integral  thresholds  were  tightened  to 

machine  precision  and  density  matrices  were  converged  to  at  least  10-8.  The  XC  potential  was 

calculated using an extremely dense Euler-Maclaurin radial grid55 with 5000 points in combination 

with  a  Lebedev  angular  grid  with  434  points  by  setting  int(acc2e=20,grid=5000434)  in  the 

Gaussian route section. Previous work by Jensen28 has shown that these large radial and angular 

grids  are necessary for numerical  integration involving basis  functions having  small  exponents 

such  that  the  Davidson  radial  norm  criterion  is  fulfilled  to  within  10-6.  In  addition,  threshold 

screenings  for  discarding  integration  points  with  low  density  were  disabled  by  changing  the 

 
 
constant SmlExp from 1.0d-6 to 1.0d-15 in the Gaussian routines utilnz.F and l301.F. Most 

importantly, we56 and others28 have found that XC-functionals containing a large percentage of 

exact exchange can converge to saddle points in the electronic parameter space, especially when 

near-degenerate orbitals are present56 or when extremely diffuse basis sets are used.28 As such, all 

SCF solutions were verified to be genuine minima in the electronic parameter space by carrying 

out a stability analysis to converge (if possible) toward a lower-energy broken-symmetry solution 

(by setting both scf(qc,conver=9) and stable=opt in the Gaussian route section), which allows for 

an unrestricted spin state as well as a reduction in symmetry of the orbitals. 

Results and Discussion 

Fig. 1 shows the smooth curves that result from computing J2 as a function of  for the first 

three rows of elements in the periodic table (H – Ar). The upper panel (a) in Fig. 1 depicts the J2 

plots using the smaller aug-pc-2 basis, and the lower panel (b) shows the corresponding plots for 

the same atoms with the customized diffuse aug-pc-∞ basis. The optimally-tuned μ values for all 

anions obtained with both basis sets are summarized in Table 1.

Based on the tabulated values of µ and their corresponding plots in Fig. 1, it is interesting 

to note that increasing the diffuseness of the basis set has a negligible effect (less than 1%) on the 

non-empirically tuned range-separated parameter. Minor exceptions to this trend include the Be 

and Mg atoms which exhibit J2 minima for the smaller aug-pc-2 basis but show nearly flat lines 

for the customized diffuse aug-pc-∞ basis.  This  discrepancy arises since  the Be and Mg atoms 

have a closed shell electronic configuration, and the addition of an extra electron leads to a strong 

inter-electronic  repulsion.  As  such,  the  customized  diffuse  aug-pc-∞  basis  possesses  enough 

flexibility to allow the extra electron to drift off to infinity (discussed further at the end of this 

section), whereas the extra electron in the smaller aug-pc-2 basis is artificially confined to remain 

close  to  the  nucleus.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  both  the  aug-pc-2  and  aug-pc-∞  basis  do  not 

exhibit J2 minima for any of the noble gas atoms (He, Ne, and Ar) as both basis sets correctly 

predict these anions to be unbound. To further understand the sensitivity of our results to the range-

separation parameter, µ, we carried out a series of benchmark tests, presented in full detail in the 

Supporting  Information.  In  short,  we  also  investigated  the  more  commonly-used  IP-tuning 

procedure  by  minimizing  the  following  objective  function:

where 

 is  the  HOMO  energy  of  the  neutral  N-electron  system  and 

 is  the 

ionization potential computed via  a  ΔSCF  energy  difference between the  N  - 1 and  N electron 

systems. With this common tuning procedure, Fig. SI-1 in the Supporting Information shows that 

the resulting J2 plots are qualitatively different than the curves shown in Fig. 1 within the main 

text. In particular, the optimal µ values obtained with the IP-tuning procedure are larger (µ ~ 0.5) 

than the corresponding µ values obtained with the EA-tuning procedure in Eq. (3). As a result, 

these  benchmark  results  support  our  rationale  for  using  the  objective  function  in  Eq.  (3)  for 

()()()22HOMOIP,JNN=+()HOMON()IPN 
 
 
accurately  calculating  electron  affinities,  as  opposed  to  the  more  commonly-used  IP-tuning 

procedure typically used for neutral systems. 

Finally, before we compare these results to other XC functionals, it is worth noting that the 

short-range DFT exchange in Eq. (2) decays exponentially on a length scale of ~1/µ and, therefore, 

smaller non-empirically tuned µ values are associated with larger systems (i.e., a smaller value of 

µ  enables  the  short-range  Coulomb  operator  to  fully  decay  to  zero  on  the  length  scale  of  the 

system). To demonstrate this trend, we plot the spatial extent, <R2> (i.e., the expectation value of 

R2), for each anion as a function of 1/μ obtained with the extremely diffuse aug-pc-∞ basis (the 

<R2> vs. 1/μ plot obtained with the smaller aug-pc-2 basis is similar and is given in the Supporting 

Information). Indeed, the optimal µ values generally reflect these trends and follow a nearly linear 

behavior (with the exception of the small H- anion) with the larger-sized anions having smaller 

values of µ than smaller anions.

diffuse aug-pc-∞ basis. The outlier value near 1/μ = 0.46 (which corresponds to the H- anion) was excluded when creating the best 
fit line. 

Turning our attention to previous reports of unbound anions and anomalous orbital energies 

in conventional XC functionals, we compare our non-empirically tuned results to electron affinities 

and HOMO energies obtained with the BLYP, B3LYP, BHHLYP, and HF approaches. We have 

chosen these specific methods for comparison due to their widespread use in previous findings27, 

28 and also because they represent different extremes of global hybrids where the HF exchange 

contribution ranges from 0.20 to 1.00.  For example, the pure BLYP functional contains no HF 

exchange, the popular B3LYP hybrid functional is parameterized with 20% exchange, the half-

and-half BHHLYP functional is constructed with 50% exchange, and the HF method is defined 

with 100% exchange. Moreover, a comparison of these XC functionals allows a fair and consistent 

evaluation since all of the DFT methods have similar LYP correlation57 portions. It is worth noting 

that we also obtained similar results with other range-separated functionals such as LC-BOP, LC-

 
 
 
 
PBE, and LC-ωPBE, which is consistent with previous work by us42-44 and Jensen28 indicating that 

the  long-range 

 exchange  term  in  Eq.  (2)  plays  a  more  dominant  role  compared  to  either 

 or 

 in  these  systems.  We  do  not  consider  the  heavily-parameterized  Minnesota 

functionals in our study since the emphasis of this work is on non-empirically tuned functionals, 

and very recent reports have shown that most of the Minnesota functionals do not obey rigorously 

known constraints of the exact functional.58, 59 Table 2 summarizes the electron affinities computed 

via a ΔSCF procedure (using the same EA = E(N) – E(N + 1) expression defined in the Theory and 

Methodology  section)  for  the  first  three  rows  of  elements  in  the  periodic  table.  Total  energies 

calculated with BLYP, B3LYP, BHHLYP, HF, and LC-BLYP for all three rows of elements in 

the periodic table are given in the Supporting Information. We emphasize that these non-standard 

calculations were incredibly difficult to converge, and the same integral thresholds, grid sizes, and 

computational settings described in the Theory and Methodology section were used. In addition, 

all SCF solutions were verified to be genuine minima in the electronic parameter space by carrying 

out a stability analysis to converge toward a lower-energy broken-symmetry solution.56 Electron 

affinities for all of the noble gas atoms (He, Ne, and Ar) computed with the smaller aug-pc-2 basis 

were  not  included  since  these  basis  sets  are  unable  to  describe  these  unbound  anions.  Fig.  3 

presents a graphical analysis of Table 2 by plotting the corresponding error (EA – EAexpt.) in the 

electron affinity.

aExperimental electron affinities from References 60-62. bMean Absolute Errors relative to experimental electron affinities.

Based on the tabulated mean absolute errors (MAE) for the customized aug-pc-∞ basis set, 

the non-empirically  tuned  LC-BLYP functional  gives the best  prediction of  the  ΔSCF electron 

affinities with a MAE of 0.11 eV, followed by the BHHLYP and B3LYP functionals with MAEs 

of 0.14 and 0.23 eV, respectively. The pure BLYP functional yields a larger MAE of 0.33 eV as 

this  method  does  not  contain  any  nonlocal  exchange,  whereas  the  HF  method  significantly 

underestimates electron affinities for several atoms (cf. Fig. 3), resulting in an even larger MAE 

of 0.69 eV due to its lack of explicit electron correlation. For all levels of theory and basis sets 

examined in this work, the largest errors in ΔSCF-computed electron affinities were observed in 

the halogen atoms (F and Cl) which arise from the strong electron repulsion that the extra electron 

feels when it is added to a nearly complete  p-shell.  In general, both Table 2 and Fig. 3  clearly 

demonstrate that XC functionals containing a larger percentage of HF exchange  yield the most 

accurate  electron  affinities;  however,  there  is  an  intricate  balance  between  exchange  and 

correlation,  and  incorporating  only  100%  nonlocal  exchange  without  correlation  as  in  the  HF 

method (or conversely, neglecting nonlocal exchange completely as in the pure BLYP functional) 

can severely corrupt the prediction of electron affinities. 

We  now  turn  our  attention  to  the  central  issue  of  unbound  anions  and  positive  HOMO 

energies  originally  mentioned  in  the  Introduction.  Table  3  summarizes  the  electron  affinities 

computed  from  the  negative  HOMO  energy  of  the  anion,  –EHOMO  for  the  first  three  rows  of 

elements in the periodic table. Again, electron affinities for all of the noble gas atoms (He, Ne, and 

Ar) computed with the smaller aug-pc-2 basis were not included since these basis sets are unable 

to describe these unbound anions. Fig. 4 presents a graphical analysis of Table 3 by plotting the 

corresponding error (–EHOMO – EAexpt.) in the electron affinity. It is interesting to note that while 

the  plots  in  Figs.  3  and  4  were  calculated  using  two  different  metrics  (ΔSCF  vs.  –EHOMO),  the 

 
 
 
resulting  plots  obtained  with  the  LC-BLYP  functional  are  nearly  identical  since  the  non-

empirically  tuned  approach  was  constructed  to  satisfy  the  constraint  in  Eq.  (3)  as  closely  as 

possible. As mentioned in the Introduction, the sign of EHOMO for anions is a more stringent test of 

these XC functionals since a positive EHOMO implies that the anion is formally unbound. As clearly 

shown  in  Table  3,  the  non-empirically  tuned  LC-BLYP  functional  correctly  predicts  negative 

EHOMO values for both basis sets (note that Table 3 lists –EHOMO values) and for all anions, with 

the exception of the Be, Mg, and noble gas atoms – all of which are experimentally unbound. To 

highlight the robustness of these LC-BLYP results, we also carried out two benchmark tests in the 

Supporting Information to (1) ascertain the effect of using other basis sets and (2) compare electron 

affinities obtained with a fixed value of µ against the non-empirically tuned LC-BLYP results listed 

in Table 3. Tables SI-1 and SI-2 in the Supporting Information give the total energies and electron 

affinities calculated with the LC-BLYP functional (fixed at µ = 0.3) for all three rows of elements 

in the periodic table using the aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-pc-2, and customized diffuse aug-pc-∞ basis sets. 

We have chosen µ = 0.3 for our benchmark tests since 0.3 is the numerical average of the µ values 

listed in Table 1 for all three rows of elements in the periodic table (H-Ar). As demonstrated by 

the total energies in Table SI-1, Jensen’s aug-pc-2 basis set is marginally better than Dunning’s 

triple-zeta  aug-cc-pVTZ  basis,  with  the  aug-pc-2  basis  providing  slightly  lower  total  energies 

across the board. Interestingly, our benchmark test in Table SI-2 demonstrates that the electron 

affinities calculated with a single value of µ (= 0.3) exhibit impressively low MAE values that are 

only marginally worse (~ 0.04 eV larger in error) than the non-empirically tuned LC-BLYP results. 

Most importantly, the LC-BLYP results (fixed at µ = 0.3) are still considerably more accurate than 

the electron affinities obtained from the other conventional functionals. To further demonstrate the 

applicability of this approach beyond single atoms, we have also calculated the electron affinities 

 
 
of molecules in the G2-1 data set, which was previously examined in a communication by Burke 

and co-workers.37  Table SI-3 in the Supporting Information lists –EHOMO for molecular anions in 

the G2-1 set  computed  with  the BLYP,  B3LYP, BHHLYP,  HF, and  LC-BLYP  approaches.  In 

agreement with previous work by Burke and co-workers,37 most molecular species (except Cl2) 

are predicted to have positive EHOMO values with conventional DFT methods (i.e., BLYP, B3LYP, 

and BHHLYP), indicating an incorrect unbound nature with these functionals. Only HF and LC-

BLYP  correctly  predict  negative  EHOMO  values  in  Table  SI-3;  however,  the  HF  values  are 

significantly  overestimated,  resulting  in  a  large  MAE  of  0.73  eV.  In  contrast,  the  LC-BLYP 

functional gives the lowest MAE of 0.29 eV and correctly predicts negative EHOMO values for all 

molecular species, which highlights the robustness of the range-separation approach in general.  

Returning to our original discussion on non-empirically tuned approaches for atoms, it should be 

noted that while the other functionals also give negative EHOMO values in Table 3 for the extremely 

diffuse  aug-pc-∞  basis,  their  mean  absolute  errors  are  still  significantly  higher  than  the  non-

empirically tuned LC-BLYP (MAE = 0.12 eV) functional: HF has a MAE of 0.31 eV, followed 

by  the  BHHLYP  and  B3LYP  functionals  with  MAEs  of  0.62  and  0.87  eV.  The  pure  BLYP 

functional exhibits the largest MAE of 0.92 eV when the aug-pc-∞ basis is used since almost all 

of the anions predicted by this functional are unbound or nearly unbound.

aExperimental electron affinities from References 60-62. bMean Absolute Errors relative to experimental electron affinities. 

Figure 4. Errors in the electron affinity computed from the negative HOMO energy of the anion, –EHOMO, for all three rows of 
elements in the periodic table using the (a) aug-pc-2 and (b) customized diffuse aug-pc-∞ basis basis sets. 

In  stark  contrast  to  the  qualitatively  good  trends  obtained  with  the  aug-pc-∞  basis,  we 

encounter particularly worrisome results  for the  conventional  XC functionals  when the smaller 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aug-pc-2  basis  is  used.  While  the  non-empirically  tuned  LC-BLYP  functional  correctly  gives 

negative EHOMO values for both basis sets, the majority of the aug-pc-2 EHOMO values predicted by 

all other DFT (not including HF) functionals are positive, incorrectly implying that these anions 

are  formally  unbound.  These  positive  EHOMO  values  severely  affect  their  accuracy,  resulting  in 

MAEs ranging from 1.16 eV (BHHLYP) to as high as 2.75 eV (BLYP) for the smaller aug-pc-2 

basis  set.  While  the  purely  nonlocal  HF  method  does  give  negative  EHOMO  values,  the  MAEs 

obtained with this approach are nearly twice that of the non-empirically tuned LC-BLYP approach. 

Recognizing that the HF method correctly gives negative EHOMO values, Burke and co-workers27 

recently proposed the following solution to compute electron affinities: compute the orbitals using 

HF  (where  EHOMO  is  correctly  predicted  to  be  negative)  but  use  the  HF  density  to  non-self-

consistently evaluate the energy with an XC potential that contains both exchange and correlation. 

While this procedure will formally give a properly bound anion with a negative EHOMO, various 

complications naturally arise: the calculation of electronic gradients becomes ill-defined since the 

electronic  potential  is  evaluated  with  one  approach  while  the  energy  is  non-self-consistently 

evaluated with another approximation. Instead, we propose the following alternative: use a non-

empirically tuned procedure (such as Eq. (3)) to satisfy DFT-Koopmans’ theorem for the anionic 

(N+1) electron system, and use the resulting tuned XC functional to self-consistently evaluate both 

orbital  energies  and  electron  affinities.  As  a  result,  this  procedure  should  yield  correct  EHOMO 

values  and  well-defined  electronic  gradients  since  both  the  potential  and  resulting  electronic 

energy are computed self-consistently. 

Finally, to complete our analysis of orbital energies and electron affinities of anions, we 

present a deeper analysis of the electronic energy as a function of electronic number (including 

fractional numbers of electrons). For an exact functional, Janak proved that E is a piecewise linear 

 
 
function of N, with derivative discontinuities at integer number of electrons.39 As such, a test of 

this deviation from linearity provides a stringent assessment of self-interaction errors inherent to 

the  underlying  functional  itself  as  well  as  a  diagnostic  analysis  of  the  basis  set  used  in  the 

calculation, as pointed out by a recent study by Tozer and co-workers40 (discussed at the end of 

this section). Fig. 5 plots the variation of the electronic energy, E, as a function of electron number, 

N, for one piece of the E(N) curve applied to the fluorine atom using the aug-pc-2 and customized 

aug-pc-  basis  sets.  Both  the  variation  of  E  vs.  N,  (a)  and  (c),  as  well  as  the  deviation  from 

linearity, (b) and (d), are also shown in Fig. 5. We have chosen to focus on fluorine since there 

have been strong discussions about this anion in several previous studies;24, 26, 40 however, the main 

qualitative results discussed in this section equally apply to the other atomic anions.  

 
 
Figure 5. Variation of the electronic energy, E, as a function of electron number, N, applied to the fluorine anion using the (a)-(b) 
aug-pc-2 and (c)-(d) customized diffuse aug-pc-∞ basis sets. The variation of E vs. N is shown in (a) and (c), whereas the deviation 
from linearity is shown in (b) and (d). The nearly-exact straight line obtained with the non-empirically tuned LC-BLYP functional 
(for all plots (a)-(d)) implies that this method is nearly SIE-free for the fluorine anion. 

As expected, the HF method yields a concave E(N) curve and an energetic destabilization 

at fractional charges. In contrast, the pure BLYP and hybrid B3LYP/BHHLYP functionals tend to 

overdelocalize the anion, leading to a convex E(N) curve and an over-stabilization (i.e. a lower 

energy) of the system at fractional charges. The non-empirically tuned LC-BLYP functional yields 

a nearly-exact straight line as a function of the fractional charge in the system (cf. Figs. 5(a) and 

 
 
 
 
 
(c)). Furthermore, plots of the deviation from linearity in Figs. 5(b) and (d) imply that the non-

empirically tuned LC-BLYP is nearly SIE-free for the fluorine anion. 

As we conclude this discussion, it is worth mentioning a few subtle points concerning basis 

sets that can be seen in Figs. (a) and (c), which were recently discussed in a study by Tozer and 

co-workers.40 For any functional, Janak proved that the slope of the E(N) curve at integer number 

of electrons is related to the orbital energies. Specifically, the limiting value of 𝜕𝐸 𝜕𝑁⁄

 to the left 

of an integer M is the HOMO energy, 

: 

and the limiting value of 𝜕𝐸 𝜕𝑁⁄

 to the right of an integer M is the LUMO energy, 

(4) 

: 

(5) 

For the case of the fluorine system shown in Fig. 5, the N = 9 endpoint corresponds to the electron 

number of the neutral fluorine atom, and  N = 10 is the electron number of the anion.  Fig. 5(a) 

shows that the limiting value of 𝜕𝐸 𝜕𝑁⁄

 to the left of N = 10 for the BLYP functional is slightly 

positive; consequently Eq. (4) states that the HOMO energy of the fluorine anion is also positive 

at the BLYP/aug-pc-2 level of theory, and the anion is formally unbound. However, the E(N) curve 

for BLYP also possesses a shallow minimum at N = 9.85 in Fig. 5(a), and the energy of the fluorine 

anion could, in principle, be further stabilized by reducing the electron number to N = 9.85 with 

the remaining 0.15 fraction of an electron drifting off to infinity with zero energy. As pointed out 

by Tozer and co-workers,40 the use of a small basis set prevents this from happening since all of 

the electrons are artificially confined to remain close to the nucleus. However, if the basis was 

sufficiently augmented  with  diffuse functions to enable fractional  electron loss, the  E(N) curve 

()HOMOM()HOMO0lim,NMEMN→=−=()LUMOM()LUMO0lim.NMEMN→=+= 
 
 
  
 
  
would approach an idealized flattening and give 

 according to Eq. (4). Indeed, we do 

observe an idealized flattening of the E(N) curve for the BLYP functional in Fig. 5(c), leading to 

a nearly zero 

 value (cf. Table 3) when the aug-pc- basis is utilized. This same assessment, 

in regards to the flattening of the E(N) curve, can also be applied to the numerical BLYP results in 

Table 2, where the electron affinities computed via the ΔSCF procedure are observed to increase 

when the aug-pc-2 basis is systematically increased towards the larger aug-pc-∞ basis set. Using 

a similar analysis for concave behavior, the E(N) curve for HF possesses a shallow maximum at N 

= 9.35 in Fig. 5(a), and the system could, in principle, lower its energy by reducing the electron 

number in that vicinity to N = 9; however, a small basis set again prevents this. When the extremely 

diffuse  aug-pc-  basis  is  used,  the  HF  curve  flattens  near  N  =  9  and  approaches  the  idealized 

behavior described by Tozer and co-workers. With this analysis, we now point out that the non-

empirically  tuned  LC-BLYP  functional  does  not  exhibit  any  tendency  towards  a  flattening  or 

fractional electron loss (similar to the CAM-B3LYP analyses in Ref. 40), resulting in an accurate 

fluorine orbital energy/electron affinity and a correctly bound anion for both basis sets. 

Conclusions 

In this study, we have assessed the accuracy of orbital energies and electron affinities for 

all three rows of elements in the periodic table (H-Ar) using a variety of theoretical approaches 

and customized basis sets. Specifically, we have closely examined the electron affinities of these 

anions using two different metrics, ΔSCF vs. –EHOMO, to understand the accuracy and intrinsic 

limitations of each theoretical approach. Among all of the theoretical methods studied here, we 

find  that  a  non-empirically  tuned  range-separated  approach  (constructed  to  satisfy  DFT-

HOMO0=HOMO 
 
 
Koopmans’ theorem for the anionic (N + 1)-electron system) provides the best accuracy for both 

metrics  (ΔSCF  and  –EHOMO)  as  well  as  for  both  basis  sets.  In  contrast,  the  electron  affinities 

obtained  from  “converged”  EHOMO  calculations  with  conventional  XC  functionals  and  smaller 

basis sets exhibit severe problems – the majority of these EHOMO values are predicted to be positive, 

incorrectly implying that these anions are formally unbound. While the purely nonlocal HF method 

does give negative EHOMO values and bound anions, there is a delicate balance between exchange 

and correlation, and the lack of electron correlation in HF yields errors that are nearly twice that 

of  a  non-empirically  tuned  range-separated  approach  (which  correctly  balances  short  range 

correlation with long-range exchange by satisfying DFT-Koopmans’ theorem). 

To address this conundrum of positive EHOMO values, other researchers have suggested to 

compute the orbitals using HF (where EHOMO is correctly predicted to be negative) but use the HF 

density to non-self-consistently evaluate the energy with an XC potential. While this procedure 

will  formally  result  in  a  bound  anion  with  a  negative  EHOMO,  the  calculation  of  electronic 

properties,  such  as  electronic  couplings  or  gradients,  becomes  ill-defined  since  the  potential  is 

evaluated  with  one  approach  while  the  energy  is  non-self-consistently  evaluated  with  another 

approximation.  We  instead  propose  the  following  alternative:  use  a  non-empirically  tuned 

procedure to satisfy DFT-Koopmans’ theorem for the anionic (N+1) electron system, and use the 

resulting  tuned  XC  functional  to  self-consistently  evaluate  both  orbital  energies  and  electron 

affinities.  This  procedure  should  yield  correct  EHOMO  values  and  well-defined  electronic 

couplings/gradients  since  the  potential  (and,  hence,  the  electronic  energy)  is  obtained  from  the 

derivative of an energy functional. Finally, we examine the orbital energies and electron affinities 

in the context of the electronic energy, E, as a function of electronic number, N, including fractional 

numbers of electrons. We find that the non-empirically tuned LC-BLYP functional yields a nearly-

 
 
exact straight line as a function of the fractional charge in the system, and plots of the deviation 

from  linearity  imply  that  the  non-empirically  tuned  LC-BLYP  is  nearly  SIE-free.  Moreover,  a 

deeper  analysis  of  the  E  vs.  N  curves  demonstrates  that  the  non-empirically  tuned  LC-BLYP 

functional does not exhibit any tendency towards a flattening or fractional electron loss, resulting 

in anions that are accurately described and correctly bound for  both basis sets. Taken together, 

these calculations and analyses provide a natural methodology for obtaining accurate and formally-

correct  bound  anions  with  well-defined  electronic  properties  (such  as  electronic  gradients  and 

couplings) in a fully self-consistent approach.
