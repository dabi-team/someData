Abstract 

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising method for conversing solar energy into 

chemical energy stored in the form of hydrogen. Nanostructured hematite (α-Fe2O3) is one of the 

most attractive materials  for highly efficient charge carrier  generation and  collection due to  its 

large specific surface area and shortening minority carrier diffusion length required to reach the 

surface. In the present work, PEC water splitting performance of α-Fe2O3 prepared by anodization 

of thin iron layers on an FTO glass and subsequent annealing in low O2-Ar ambient with only 

0.03% O2 was investigated. The key finding is that annealing the anodic nanostructures with low 

oxygen concentration provides a strongly enhanced PEC performance compared with classic air 

annealing. The photocurrent of the former at 1.5 V vs. RHE results in 1.1 mA/cm2, being 11 times 

higher than that of the latter. The enhancement of the PEC performance for α-Fe2O3 annealed in 

low oxygen atmosphere can be attributed to controlled morphology, Sn doping, and introduction 

of  oxygen  vacancies,  which  contribute  to  the  enhancement  of  the  hole  flux  from  the 

photogenerated site to the reactive surface and additionally lead to an enhanced hole transfer at the 

interface between the α-Fe2O3 and the electrolyte.  From the obtained results, it is evident that low 

oxygen annealing is a surprisingly effective method of defect engineering and optimizing α-Fe2O3 

electrodes for a maximized PEC water splitting performance. 

1.  Introduction 

Hydrogen with zero CO2 emission ranks among the most promising, clean, and renewable 

energy vectors that can replace fossil fuels, which still represent the main energy source but have 

2 

 
 
a  detrimental  impact  on  the  environment.  Photoelectrochemical  (PEC)  water  splitting  is  a 

promising  strategy  for  conversing  solar  energy  into  chemical  energy  stored  in  the  form  of 

hydrogen.1  In  1972,  Fujishima  and  Honda  first  demonstrated  the  electrochemical  photolysis  of 

water into hydrogen and oxygen by using TiO2 as a semiconductor photoanode.2 Since that seminal 

work  a  large  range  of  metal  oxide  semiconductors  have  been  investigated  for  their  PEC  water 

splitting application.3-6 Among them, hematite iron oxide (α-Fe2O3) is one of the most attractive 

materials due to many favorable properties such as a suitable band gap (1.9-2.2 eV) for absorbing 

a  significant  portion  of  the  visible  light,  high  chemical  stability  in  many  electrolytes,  stability 

against the photocorrosion, abundance, and low cost.7,8 Nevertheless, the PEC performance of α-

Fe2O3 is still limited by several key factors such as short excited state lifetime (<10 ps),9 short 

diffusion length (2-4 nm) of minority charge carriers (holes),10 low carrier mobility (10-2 to 10-1 

cm2/Vs),11,12  and  a  poor  electrical  conductivity  (10-14  S/cm),13  hinder  its  practical  application. 

These  detrimental  optical  and  electronic  properties  lead  to  a  poor  collection  of  photogenerated 

holes and their fast recombination with electrons in the hematite bulk. In order to enhance the PEC 

performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, a wide range of approaches have been explored, including 

careful  nanostructuring,14  elemental  doping  (e.g.,  by  Sn,  Ti,  Si),15-17  and  the  decoration  of  the 

hematite surface by various oxygen evolution reaction (OER) co-catalysts (e.g., IrO2, Co-Pi (Co-

phosphate),  FeOOH).18-20  Sivula  et  al.15  reported  that  nanocrystalline  α-Fe2O3  photoanodes 

deposited on an FTO glass (transparent fluorine doped tin oxide layer coated on a glass substrate) 

that are annealed at 700 °C or below exhibit no photocurrent for PEC water splitting. However, 

upon the annealing at 800 °C, the photoactivity of α-Fe2O3 was drastically improved as a result of 

the thermally driven diffusion of Sn ions from the FTO substrate into the hematite lattice acting 

here as the donor dopant. Similarly, the introduction of oxygen vacancies has also been reported 

3 

 
to  enhance  the  photoresponse  of  α-Fe2O3  via  a  self-doping  mechanism.21  Furthermore, 

nanostructuring of α-Fe2O3 provides a highly improved efficiency in the charge carrier generation 

and collection due to the enhancement of the specific surface area and drastic shortening of the  

minority  carrier  diffusion  length.14  The  α-Fe2O3  nanostructures   have  been  synthesized  using  a 

variety  of  techniques  including  sol-gel  processing,22  electrodeposition,23  spray  pyrolysis,24 

hydrothermal  synthesis,25,26  magnetron  sputtering,27,28  and  electrochemical  anodization.29,30 

Among them, anodization is considered a viable technique for the fabrication of nanostructured α-

Fe2O3 from the viewpoint of large-scale production and cost reduction.30 The anodically fabricated 

oxide films are typically amorphous and need to be thermally treated in order to become converted 

into the crystalline form (hematite α-Fe2O3). However, if the nanostructured layers are formed on 

metallic  iron  substrates,  the  thermal  annealing  leads  to  the  formation  of  gradient  oxide  layers 

consisting of wustite (FeO), magnetite (Fe3O4), and α-Fe2O3 crystalline phases.31 The presence of 

these phases cannot be avoided because of the complex additional thermal oxidation of underlying 

metal substrate during the annealing. The FeO and Fe3O4 phases are not suitable for a photolysis 

of  water  as  they  behave  either  metal-like  or  as  a  narrow  band  gap  (<1  eV)  semiconductor,21,29 

therefore,  plain  α-Fe2O3  is  the  desired  phase  for  PEC  water  splitting  applications.  A  complete 

anodization of a magnetron sputtered metallic iron film on the FTO substrate prior to the thermal 

annealing  is  an  efficient  strategy  to  avoid  the  creation  of  the  unwanted  iron  oxide  phases.32,33 

Furthermore,  the  preparation  of  photoanodes  on  a  transparent  substrate  enables  back  side 

illumination, i.e., the irradiation of the sample from the direction of the substrate/semiconductor 

interface, which, in many cases, have led to an improved PEC activity.34,35 It is also well known 

that annealing conditions such as temperature and atmosphere affect the PEC performance of α-

Fe2O3 layers.15,30,32,36-38 Ling et al.36 reported that photoresponse of hydrothermally grown α-Fe2O3 

4 

 
nanowires was activated by annealing in an oxygen deficient atmosphere achieved in an evacuated 

furnace refilled by pure N2. It was shown that the generation of oxygen vacancies considerably 

increased the electrical conductivity. On the other hand, it was also described that α-Fe2O3, under 

these reducing conditions, can be easily converted into undesired Fe3O4. In the present work, we 

create a fully converted α-Fe2O3 nanostructure on FTO substrate by the aforementioned approach. 

Key  is  the  use  of  a  defined  low  oxygen  annealing  environment  to  obtain  a  highly  active 

nanostructured  α-Fe2O3  photoanode.  First,  high-quality  iron  films  with  carefully  controlled 

thicknesses were deposited on an FTO substrate by a modified magnetron sputtering technique. 

Subsequently, the films were fully anodized to amorphous nanostructured iron oxide. Finally, we 

investigated the effect of annealing of these nanostructures on their PEC performance in a defined 

gas environment containing a very low concentration of oxygen (Ar + 0.03% O2 atmosphere). We 

demonstrate that the controlled annealing in low oxygen ambient can drastically improve the PEC 

performance of α-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes (more than tenfold compared with classic air annealing).  

2.  Experimental section 

2.1 Preparation of α-Fe2O3 layers 

The α-Fe2O3 photoanodes were prepared by anodization of a thin Fe layer deposited on FTO 

glass supports, followed by ambient controlled annealing. Initially, thin Fe layers were prepared 

on an FTO glass (TOC22-15, Solaronix) by a high-energy magnetron sputtering method known as 

high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Before the deposition, the FTO substrates 

were carefully cleaned by subsequent sonication baths of isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, and water. 

The HiPIMS depositions were carried out in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) reactor continuously 

5 

 
 
pumped down by turbo-molecular pump providing a base pressure of 10-5 Pa. The metallic target 

of pure iron (99.995%, Plasmaterials) with  an outer  diameter 50 mm and  an argon  atmosphere 

were used  as  the iron source  and  a working  gas, respectively.  The working  gas was fed to the 

reactor with the flow rate of 30 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute). The FTO substrates 

were not externally heated during the depositions, so the temperature of the FTO rose up to ~ 80 °C 

owing to the energy bombardment. The operating pressure was 1 Pa. The pulsing frequency of the 

DC HiPIMS discharge was 100 Hz with the duty cycle of 1 %. The sputtering time was adjusted 

so that the thickness of the deposited Fe layers on FTO was 300 nm. 

In the next step, the Fe films were transformed into the amorphous iron oxide nanostructures 

by  electrochemical  anodization  procedure.  The  anodization  was  performed  in  a  solution  of 

ethylene glycol (EG, ≥99.5%, Carl Roth) containing 0.2 M NH4F (≥98%, Carl Roth) and 3 vol% 

H2O at 50 V and at room temperature. A two-electrode system, in which the Fe layer on the FTO 

and  a  Pt  sheet  served  as  the  working  and  counter  electrodes,  respectively,  was  used.  After  the 

anodization the samples were rinsed with water and dried in a nitrogen stream. The anodized layers 

were then annealed at 600 °C for 40 min and 750 °C for 20 min in air and in 0.03% O2-Ar ambient 

using  a  tube  furnace  (Linn  High  Therm,  FRH-40/250/1500).  The  0.03%  O2-Ar  ambient  was 

provided by a continuous flow through the furnace using a commercial gas cylinder (VARIGON® 

S,  Linde)  prior  to  and  during  the  annealing  process.  The  samples  were  labeled  based  on  the 

annealing temperature-atmosphere (i.e., 600-Air, 750-LO (Low Oxygen)).  

2.2 Layer characterization 

The  morphology  of  layers  was  investigated  using  a  scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM, 

Hitachi, S-4800). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed with an X’pert Philips MPD (equipped 

with  a  Panalytical  X’celerator  detector)  with  a  graphite  monochromatic  CuKα  radiation  (λ  = 

6 

 
1.54056  Å).  The  chemical  composition  and  the  oxidation  state  were  characterized  by  X-ray 

photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5600), and the peak positions were calibrated on the C 1s 

peak at 284.8 eV. Solid-state conductivity measurements were carried out in an adapted scanning 

electron  microscope  (SEM,  TESCAN  LYRA3  XMU)  by  2-point  measurements  using  a 

semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200-SCS). Tungsten tips were used as electrical 

contacts between the α-Fe2O3 layer surface and the FTO substrate. Resistivity values were then 

obtained from the I-V curves by ramping the potential from -2 V to 2 V at a sweep rate of 5 mV/s. 

2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements 

The PEC performance of the α-Fe2O3 photoanodes was measured in a three-electrode PEC 

cell, where a Pt counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (3M KCl) reference electrode in a 1.0 M KOH 

electrolyte were used. The photocurrent-potential (J-V) properties were studied by scanning the 

potential from -0.5 to 0.7 V at a scan rate of 2 mV/s under periodic illumination of AM 1.5 G (100 

mW/cm2)  light.  The  potentials  versus  Ag/AgCl  (3  M  KCl)  were  converted  to  the  reversible 

hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation. 

𝐸RHE = 𝐸Ag/AgCl  + 𝐸Ag/AgCl

0

+ 0.059 pH            (1) 

where  𝐸RHE  is  the  converted  potential  versus  RHE,  𝐸Ag/AgCl   is  the  experimentally  measured 

potential, and 𝐸Ag/AgCl

0

=  0.209 V at  25 °C for a Ag/AgCl  electrode  in  3 M  KCl. The incident 

photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was acquired in the range from 300 to 700 nm with 5 nm steps 

at an applied potential of 1.5 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M KOH. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 

(EIS), Mott-Schottky measurements, and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) 

measurements were carried out using a Zahner IM6 (Zahner Elektrik) with a tunable light source 

TLS03. The EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at 

7 

 
1.5 V vs. RHE with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV and a 452 nm light source with the intensity 

of  10 mW/cm2. The Mott-Schottky measurements were conducted at a frequency of 10 kHz under 

dark conditions. The donor density (Nd) was calculated by the following equation (2). 

𝑁d = (2/𝑒0ε𝜀0)[d(1/𝐶2)/d𝑉]−1           (2) 

where e0 is the electron charge (1.60 × 10-19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of α-Fe2O3 (80),17 ε0 is 

the  permittivity  vacuum  (8.85  ×  10-12  Fm-1),  and  C  is  the  capacitance  derived  from  the 

electrochemical impedance at each potential (V). The IMPS responses were recorded in the range 

of 1.0–1.7 V vs. RHE with 0.1 V steps under 452 nm light illumination with the intensity of 10 

mW/cm2. The light intensity was modulated by 10% between 1 kHz and 0.1 Hz. 

3.  Results and discussion 

In order to produce nanostructured phase-pure α-Fe2O3 photoanodes without forming Fe3O4 

and/or FeO phase impurities, a thin metallic Fe layer with a thickness of 300 nm was deposited on 

an FTO glass by magnetron sputtering. Next, the Fe layer was anodized at room temperature in an 

EG electrolyte containing 0.2 mol/L NH4F and 3 vol% H2O using the voltage of 50 V. The end 

point of the anodization was detected by an increase in the anodic current recorded on-line during 

the anodization process (Fig. S1).32 The anodization procedure completely transformed the non-

transparent iron layer to fully transparent iron oxide nanostructure as it is evident from Fig. 1(a-1).  

Fig. 1(b) shows the surface SEM image of the layer after anodization, and the morphology exhibits 

a nanoporous structure. Subsequently, the anodized layers were annealed at 600 and 750 °C in air 

and 0.03% O2-Ar ambient. All the annealed layers had a thickness of 450-520 nm. The surface 

appearance  and  SEM  images  of  these  layers  are  shown  in  Fig.  1(a-2,  c-f).  The  layers  were 

transparent even after the annealing. However, the color of the layers changed from yellow to red 

8 

 
 
after  the  anodization  and  subsequent  annealing,  as  it  is  apparent  for  the  α-Fe2O3  photoanode 

annealed at 600 °C in low oxygen ambient (600-LO) (Fig. 1(a-2)); other samples also exhibited a 

similar  red  color,  which  indicated  a  transformation  of  the  amorphous  structure  to  the  α-Fe2O3 

phase.39 The morphologies of these layers changed depending on the annealing conditions. Larger 

particles were formed in the layers annealed at 750 °C (750-LO, 750-Air) compared with those 

annealed at 600 °C (600-LO, 600-Air) under the same ambient conditions. Similar coarsening of 

the  particles  at  higher  temperatures  has  also  been  reported  in  literature.15  Interestingly  and 

importantly, the coarsening of the particles was inhibited in low oxygen annealing (600-LO, 750-

LO)  compared  with  air  annealing  (600-Air,  750-Air).  In  the  case  of  the  600-LO  sample,  the 

nanoporous  structure  obtained  during  the  anodization  was  fully  maintained.  The  SEM  images 

verified that the lower temperature and low oxygen concentration annealing were able to retain the 

desired nanostructured morphology.  

The crystal structure of the layers after the annealing process was determined by XRD, and 

the resulting XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, only the peaks corresponding to α-Fe2O3 

and SnO2 attributed to the FTO substrate were identified. In other words, a layer that fully consists 

of only α-Fe2O3 can be fabricated by completely anodizing an iron thin layer on the FTO glass 

followed by annealing. 

The layers were further  analyzed by XPS. Fig. 3 shows the survey spectra as well as the 

high-resolution  Sn  3d,  O  1s,  and  Fe  2p  spectra  of  the  α-Fe2O3  after  annealing  under  various 

conditions. The survey spectra revealed that the α-Fe2O3 contained not only Fe and O but also Sn 

dopants due to the diffusion from the FTO substrate during the annealing process (Fig. 3(a)).15,33 

The high resolution XPS spectra of the Sn 3d indicate the increase in the Sn concentration after 

annealing  at  a  higher  temperature  and  in  low  oxygen  ambient  (Fig.  3(b)).  The  atomic 

9 

 
concentrations of the Sn quantified from XPS spectra are shown in Table 1. Remarkably, the α-

Fe2O3 annealed in low oxygen environment shows a higher Sn concentration compared with air 

annealing. This can be attributed to the acceleration of Sn diffusion from the FTO substrate into 

the α-Fe2O3 by grain boundary diffusion since the α-Fe2O3 annealed in the low oxygen ambient 

provides a fine crystalline nanostructure, as shown in Fig. 1. The spectra of O 1s show that the 

binding  energy  centered  at  around  529.7  eV  for  600-Air  is  shifted  to  a  slightly  higher  binding 

energy  compared  with  the  α-Fe2O3  samples  having  a  higher  Sn  concentration  (Fig.3(c)).  This 

suggests that the Sn doping would exert influence on the Fe-O lattice and increase the binding 

energy.40 In the Fe 2p spectra, Fe 2p3/2 peaks around 711 eV, Fe 2p1/2 peaks around 724 eV, and 

satellite peaks of Fe3+ around 719 eV can be clearly identified (Fig. 3(d)). These values have been 

reported as typical binding energies for Fe2O3.36,39,41-43 In addition to these peaks, a variation of 

peak  intensity  at  716  eV,  which  corresponds  to  a  Fe2+  satellite  peak,36,39,41-43  can  be  observed, 

depending  on  the  annealing  conditions.  Peak  deconvolution  was  performed  on  each  Fe  2p 

spectrum (Fig. S2),44,45 and the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio was obtained from the area ratio of each satellite 

peak, as shown in Table 1.  The ratio of Fe2+ increased for low oxygen and higher temperature 

annealing. These results suggest that oxygen vacancies that act as shallow donors are created in 

the α-Fe2O3.36 Since the Sn dopants as well as the oxygen vacancies can act as an electron donor, 

they can improve the electrical conductivity of α-Fe2O3 via a polaron hopping mechanism.46,47 

In  order  to  confirm  the  conductance  of  the  α-Fe2O3  layers,  solid  state  conductivity 

measurements  were  carried  out  in  an  adapted  SEM  by  2-point  measurements  using  a 

semiconductor characterization system. The measured  I-V curves are  shown in  Fig. S3  and the 

corresponding electric resistances are shown in Table 1. The α-Fe2O3 annealed in the low oxygen 

ambient (750-LO, 600-LO) shows a higher conductivity compared with samples annealed in air 

10 

 
(750-Air,  600-Air).  This  can  be  ascribed  to  the  increased  donor  density  by  Sn  doping  and  the 

introduction  of  oxygen  vacancies.  Therefore,  annealing  in  low  oxygen  ambient  is  an  effective 

method for enhancing electrical conductivity of α-Fe2O3. However, it should be noted that 600-

LO shows the best conductivity despite the fact that 750-LO has the highest Sn concentration and 

Fe2+ ratio. Yang et al.48 reported on the conductance of α-Fe2O3 doped with various concentrations 

of Sn and revealed that the electrical conductance of α-Fe2O3 can be improved by increasing the 

Sn  concentration  only  up  to  a  certain  critical  concentration  level  (in  fact,  corresponding  to  the 

solubility limit of Sn in Fe2O3); above this level the overall conductivity decreases significantly. 

Similarly, in the case of 750-LO in our experiment, Sn seemed to act as a scattering center that 

reduced the conductivity of α-Fe2O3 once the solubility of Sn was reached. Therefore, exceeding 

the  optimal  annealing  temperature  (with  excessively  high  Sn  concentrations)  leads  to  the 

conductivity deterioration of α-Fe2O3.  

The PEC water splitting performance of the fabricated α-Fe2O3 layers was measured in a 1.0 

M  KOH  electrolyte.  The  corresponding  photocurrent-potential  (J-V)  curves  recorded  under  the 

chopped light illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm2) are shown in Fig. 4(a). The 600-LO sample 

that shows preserved nanostructuring and has the highest conductivity also exhibits the best PEC 

water splitting performance. The photocurrent value reaches 1.1 mA/cm2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE, which 

is 1.8 times and 11 times higher than that of 750-Air (0.6 mA/cm2) and 600-Air (0.1 mA/cm2) 

samples, respectively. Further, the quantum yields of the reactions represented as the IPCE values 

were measured at 1.5 V vs. RHE as a function of the incident light wavelength; the results are 

available in Fig. 4(b). The IPCE values for all α-Fe2O3 layers gradually drop to zero at wavelengths 

above  610  nm,  in  accordance  with  the  bandgap  of  α-Fe2O3.7  Importantly,  the  600-LO  shows 

significantly enhanced IPCE magnitude compared with all the other α-Fe2O3 layers over the entire 

11 

 
wavelengths that are in accordance with the J-V curves. The highest efficiency is 18.8% at the 

wavelength  of  330  nm.  Literature15,49,50  mentioned  that  the  PEC  performance  of  α-Fe2O3 

photoanodes on an FTO glass was greatly improved by their annealing at above 750 °C or at a 

lower temperature for a long time (e.g., 600 °C for 8 h). The enhancement of the PEC performance 

was attributed to the increased electrical conductivity as a result of the incorporation of Sn as the 

donor  doping  element  coming  from  the  FTO  substrate  due  to  the  thermal  diffusion.  This 

phenomenon occurred in our samples annealed in air - we observed a better performance for the 

750-Air sample, which provided a higher Sn concentration and conductivity compared with the 

600-Air sample. In contrast, the results for low oxygen annealing (600-LO, 750-LO) exhibited the 

best PEC performance for the α-Fe2O3 annealed at 600 °C for 40 min. The conversely degraded 

PEC performance for 750-LO can be attributed to a combination of larger particle size of α-Fe2O3 

(Fig.  1)  and  lower  conductivity  (Table.  1)  compared  with  600-LO.  This  indicates  that  the 

enhancement of the photoresponse of the α-Fe2O3 annealed in low oxygen ambient can be activated 

even  at  lower  temperature  of  600  °C  and  by  shorter  annealing  times.  Annealing  at  a  lower 

temperature and simultaneously for shorter time gains practical significance because it can reduce 

the damage to the structure and electrical conductivity of the FTO substrate as well as reducing 

the energy cost of the annealing process.51  

In order to investigate the donor densities of α-Fe2O3 layers annealed under every conditions, 

Mott-Schottky measurements were carried out in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte under dark conditions. 

The Mott-Schottky plots are shown in Fig. 5(a). The slopes of Mott-Schottky plots for all α-Fe2O3 

samples  are  positive,  which  indicates  that  they  are  n-type  semiconductors  with  electrons  as 

majority carriers. The donor densities estimated from the slopes of Mott-Schottky plots are shown 

in  Table  1.  Importantly,  the  600-LO  sample,  which  exhibited  the  best  PEC  water  splitting 

12 

 
performance, showed the highest donor density of 4.88 × 10+19, which was more than one order 

higher than that of the 600-Air sample (4.86 × 10+18). Since the donor density of α-Fe2O3 can be 

increased  by  Sn  doping  and  the  introduction  of  oxygen  vacancies,36,49  the  improvement  of  the 

donor  density  for  the  600-LO  can  be  attributed  to  these  effects.  The  donor  densities  are  also 

consistent with the conductivity measurements (Table 1 and Fig. S3). In other words, low oxygen 

annealing  promotes  Sn  doping  and  introduction  of  oxygen  vacancies,  and  increases  the  donor 

density of α-Fe2O3. As a result, the improvement of electrical conductivity of α-Fe2O3 leads to an 

excellent  PEC  water  splitting  performance.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  750-LO  shows  a 

lower donor density than that of 600-LO in spite of exhibiting the highest Sn concentration and 

Fe2+ ratio. Aroutiounian et al.52 investigated the donor density of Sn doped α-Fe2O3 and suggested 

that the donor density of α-Fe2O3 drastically increased until 1.0 at% of Sn, and then decreased 

sharply to 1.5 at%. As described above for the change in the conductivity of Sn doped α-Fe2O3, it 

has been reported that the donor density and the conductivity of α-Fe2O3 decrease when the Sn 

concentration exceeds a certain level. Our results agree well with these findings.  

Furthermore, EIS measurements  of the  α-Fe2O3 layers  were  carried out  in  a  1.0 M KOH 

electrolyte at 1.5 V vs. RHE under visible light illumination (wavelength of 452 nm, 10 mW/cm2). 

The EIS results in the form of Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 5(b). The experimental data were 

fitted by using the equivalent circuit model depicted in the inset image of Fig. 5(b), and the fitting 

results are summarized in Table S1. The equivalent circuit consists of a series resistance, Rs, bulk 

resistance of α-Fe2O3, R1, charge transfer resistance at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface, R2, the 

space  charge  capacitance  of  the  bulk  α-Fe2O3,  C1,  and  the  space  charge  capacitance  at  the  α-

Fe2O3/electrolyte interface, C2.53,54 Sample 600-LO exhibits the smallest semicircle and smallest 

values of R1 and R2 compared with all other α-Fe2O3 layers. The smallest value of R1 for 600-LO 

13 

 
coincides with the results of the conductivity and the Mott-Schottky measurements, which show 

the highest conductivity and the highest donor density, respectively, for 600-LO. In other words, 

the  electrons,  which  are  majority  carriers  of  the  α-Fe2O3  electrode,  can  be  rapidly  transferred 

within the bulk α-Fe2O3, which has a high conductivity. This, in turn, reduces their recombination 

with photoexcited holes. Therefore, R1 can be assigned to the recombination resistance inside the 

bulk  α-Fe2O3,  and  the  smallest  R1  for  600-LO  denotes  a  reduced  recombination  and  an  easy 

extraction of the holes from the bulk α-Fe2O3 through the electrode surface. On the other hand, a 

smaller value of R2, which means charge transfer resistance, indicates that the holes extracted into 

the electrode surface easily transfer from α-Fe2O3 to the electrolyte and contribute to the OER, 

which is in line with literature for Sn doped α-Fe2O3.55-57 Therefore, the smallest R2 for 600-LO 

can be attributed to Sn doping into the α-Fe2O3.  

IMPS measurements for 600-LO and 600-Air were carried out in order to understand the 

effect of low oxygen annealing on the kinetics of electron-hole recombination and hole transfer in 

greater detail. The variations of IMPS responses as a function of applied potential were measured 

in  a  1.0  M  KOH  electrolyte  under  illumination  (wavelength  of  452  nm,  10  mW/cm2).  The 

theoretical background to IMPS measurements was described in-depth by Peter et al.58-61 Fig. 6(a) 

shows a typical IMPS response for 600-LO at 1.1 V vs. RHE. Two semicircles can be identified 

in the complex plane plots. The lower semicircle corresponds to the high frequency part that arises 

from RC attenuation by series resistance of the FTO glass and the space charge capacitance of the 

α-Fe2O3 layer, whereas the upper semicircle corresponding to the low frequency part indicates the 

competition  between  the  recombination  and  hole  transfer.  Therefore,  the  rate  constant  of 

recombination, krec, and the rate constant of hole transfer, ktrans, can be evaluated by analyzing the 

upper semicircle. Typically, when the illumination is irradiated to α-Fe2O3 electrode, instantaneous 

14 

 
photocurrent is observed, which corresponds to a hole current. The instantaneous hole current is 

not associated with charge transfer across the interface between electrode/electrolyte. Under the 

continued illumination,  the photocurrent  exponentially decays  due to the  hole build-up and the 

recombination of the holes and electrons until it reaches steady-state photocurrent (Fig. S4). In the 

IMPS response shown in Fig. 6(a), the maximum real photocurrent at high frequency, jHF, and the 

minimum real photocurrent at low frequency, jLF, correspond to the instantaneous photocurrent 

when the light is irradiated and the steady-state photocurrent under illumination, respectively. The 

ratio of these photocurrents represents the transfer efficiency, ηtrans, which is the fraction of holes 

that successfully transferred to the electrode/electrolyte interface and contributed to the OER, as 

shown in equation (3). 

𝜂trans =

𝑗LF
𝑗HF

=

𝑘trans
𝑘trans+𝑘rec

(3) 

Furthermore, the radial frequency at the maximum point of the upper semicircle corresponds to 

the sum of ktrans and krec as expressed in equation (4). 

𝜔max = 𝑘trans + 𝑘rec            (4) 

Consequently, ktrans and krec can be derived from equation (3) and (4). The variations of jHF and jLF 

for 600-LO and 600-Air as a function of applied potential are shown in Fig. 6(b). The variation of 

jLF shown by open symbols in Fig. 6(b) is consistent with the J-V curves displayed in Fig. 4(a) 

because  both  of  these  photocurrents  represent  the  situation  under  steady-state  photocurrents. 

Importantly, 600-LO exhibits a greatly higher jHF over the entire potential range compared with 

600-Air conditions. Considering that the jHF correspond to the hole flux without recombination, 

this trend thus indicates that the photogeneration and transport of holes are significantly improved 

for  600-LO.  Since  nanostructuring  reduces  the  diffusion  length  required  for  holes  to  reach  the 

15 

 
 
electrode surface, in addition to improving the light harvesting, it is plausible that the nanostructure 

morphology  of  600-LO  (see  Fig.  1(c))  contributes  to  the  increase  of  jHF.  Fig.  6(c)  shows  the 

variation of ηtrans for 600-LO and 600-Air derived by equation (3). Also in this case the ηtrans for 

600-LO  exhibits  much  higher  values  compared  with  600-Air.  The  increase  in  the  transfer 

efficiency, ηtrans, can be explained in terms of the competition between the interfacial hole transfer 

and  the  electron-hole  recombination  at  the  surface.  In  other  words,  a  higher  ηtrans  means  an 

enhancement of the interfacial hole transfer and/or suppression of the electron-hole recombination 

at the surface. Therefore, in order to discuss the kinetics of hole transfer and recombination, the 

variations of both rate constants as a function of potential in the range of 1.0-1.3 V vs. RHE are 

summarized in Fig. 6(d). It should be noted that the extraction of reliable rate constants becomes 

difficult for the potential of equal or greater than1.4 V vs. RHE as the upper semicircles for 600-

LO  become  extremely  small.  The  rate  constants  of  surface  recombination,  krec,  depend  on  the 

applied  potential  for  both  α-Fe2O3  layers,  which  is  expected  to  be  related  to  the  electron 

concentration  at  the  surface  of  α-Fe2O3.62  As  the  rate  constants  of  recombination  for  600-LO 

clearly exhibit smaller values compared with the 600-Air sample, this suggests  suppression of 

electron-hole  recombination  at  the  surface.  EIS  measurements  indicated  suppression  of 

recombination in the bulk α-Fe2O3, as described above. The suppression of recombination both on 

the surface and in the bulk of α-Fe2O3 can be attributed to the improvement in the conductivity for 

600-LO due to Sn doping and the introduction of oxygen vacancies in α-Fe2O3. The rapid transport 

and transfer of electrons leads to a reduction in the recombination rate of the photoexcited holes 

with  electrons.  The  rate  constants  of  hole  transfer,  ktrans,  for  600-LO  exhibit  higher  values 

compared with 600-Air. As shown in Table S1, EIS measurements revealed the smallest value of 

R2  (a  charge  transfer  resistance  at  the  α-Fe2O3/electrolyte  interface)  for  600-LO.  Both  results 

16 

 
suggest a significant enhancement of the hole transfer at the interface between the α-Fe2O3 and the 

electrolyte. Dunn et al.61 also reported an increase in the rate constant of the hole transfer for the 

Sn doped α-Fe2O3. Thus, the enhancement of the hole transfer for 600-LO can be attributed to Sn 

doping in the α-Fe2O3, indicating an effective catalysis of the OER on the surface of the α-Fe2O3. 

It can be concluded from the IMPS measurements that the low oxygen annealing improves the 

hole flux from the photogenerated site to the reactive surface because of the nanostructuring of α-

Fe2O3. In addition, the electron-hole recombination at the surface of α-Fe2O3 is suppressed due to 

the improvement in the conductivity of α-Fe2O3, and the hole transfer at the interface between the 

α-Fe2O3 and the electrolyte is enhanced due to the Sn doping in α-Fe2O3.  

4.  Conclusions 

In the present study, we investigated the PEC water splitting performance of nanostructured 

α-Fe2O3 photoanode prepared on an FTO glass and particularly the effect of annealing in a low 

oxygen content environment, which was 0.03% O2-Ar ambient. The α-Fe2O3 layer produced by 

anodization of sputtered  metallic iron film  followed by  annealing  at  600 °C for 40 min in  low 

oxygen ambient exhibits a strongly enhanced PEC performance compared with conventional air 

annealing. The photocurrent under illumination AM 1.5 G, 100 mW/cm2 for the α-Fe2O3 annealed 

in low oxygen ambient resulted 1.1 mA/cm2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE, which was 11 times higher than 

that  of  the  air  annealed  reference.  From  the  results  of  multiple  analyses  and  evaluations,  the 

following  mechanistic  facts  can  be  deduced:  The  improvement  in  the  PEC  performance  for  α-

Fe2O3  annealed  in  a  low  oxygen  ambient  can  be  attributed  to  a  coordinated  action  of 

nanostructuring, Sn doping, and introduction of suitable oxygen vacancies. Low oxygen annealing 

avoids coarsening of the α-Fe2O3 nanostructure. This allows to maintain short diffusion length of 

17 

 
 
holes, and supports the hole flux from the photogenerated site to the reactive surface. Sn doping 

from FTO into α-Fe2O3 and introduction of oxygen vacancies are enhanced by the low oxygen 

annealing. These effects contribute to an increase in the donor density and result an improvement 

of the conductivity, which leads to a low electron-hole recombination rate. Additionally, Sn doping 

into α-Fe2O3 enhances also the hole transfer at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. 

On the basis of these results, it is evident that low oxygen annealing of α-Fe2O3 nanostructure is a 

very effective method for enhancing their PEC water splitting performance. It also demonstrates 

that low oxygen annealing can activate a strong photoresponse of α-Fe2O3 on FTO glass even at a 

significantly lower temperature and for shorter times than previously reported, which is of high 

practical significance.
