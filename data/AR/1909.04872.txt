POSITIVE SOLUTIONS FOR A CLASS OF SINGULAR
DIRICHLET PROBLEMS

NIKOLAOS S. PAPAGEORGIOU, VICENT¸ IU D. R ˘ADULESCU, AND DUˇSAN D. REPOVˇS

Abstract. We consider a Dirichlet elliptic problem driven by the Laplacian
with singular and superlinear nonlinearities. The singular term appears on the
left-hand side while the superlinear perturbation is parametric with parameter
λ > 0 and it need not satisfy the AR-condition. Having as our starting point
the work of Diaz-Morel-Oswald (1987), we show that there is a critical param-
eter value λ∗ such that for all λ > λ∗ the problem has two positive solutions,
while for λ < λ∗ there are no positive solutions. What happens in the critical
case λ = λ∗ is an interesting open problem.

1. Introduction

Let Ω ⊆ RN (N > 2) be a bounded domain with a C2-boundary ∂Ω.

In this

paper we study the following parametric singular Dirichlet problem

(Pλ)

− ∆u(z) + u(z)

−γ = λf (z, u(z)) in Ω, u|∂Ω = 0, u > 0, 0 < γ < 1.

In this problem, λ is a positive parameter and f : Ω × R → R is a Carath´eodory
function (that is, for all x ∈ R, the mapping z 7→ f (z, x) is measurable and for
almost all z ∈ Ω, the mapping x 7→ f (z, x) is continuous). We assume that for
almost all z ∈ Ω, f (z, ·) exhibits superlinear growth near +∞, but it need not
satisfy the usual in such cases Ambrosetti-Robinowitz condition (the AR-condition
for short).

The distinguishing feature of our work is that the singular term u−γ appears on
the left-hand side of the equation. This is in contrast with almost all previous works
on singular elliptic equations driven by the Laplacian, where the forcing term (the
right-hand side of the equation) is u 7→ u−γ + λf (z, u), so the singular term u−γ
appears on the right-hand side of the equation. We mention the works of Coclite &
Palmieri [2], Sun, Wu & Long [13], and Haitao [7], which also deal with equations
that have the competing eﬀects of singular and superlinear terms. A comprehensive
bibliography on semilinear singular Dirichlet problems can be found in the book by
Ghergu & R˘adulescu [5]. The present class of singular equations was ﬁrst considered
by Diaz, Morel & Oswald [3], for the case when the perturbation f is independent of
u. They produced a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of positive
f ˆu1dz, with ˆu1 being the positive L2-normalized

solutions in terms of the integral

Our aim is to study the precise dependence of the set of positive solutions of
problem (Pλ) with respect to the parameter λ > 0. In this direction, we show that
there exists a critical parameter value λ∗ > 0 such that

• for all λ > λ∗, problem (Pλ) has at least two positive smooth solutions;
• for all λ ∈ (0, λ∗), problem (Pλ) has no positive solutions.

It is an open problem what happens in the critical case λ = λ∗. We describe the
diﬃculties one encounters when treating the critical case λ = λ∗ and why we think
that λ∗ > 0 is not admissible.

2. Preliminaries and hypotheses
Let X be a Banach space and ϕ ∈ C1(X, R). We say that ϕ(·) satisﬁes the

“C-condition”, if the following property holds

“Every sequence {un}n>1 ⊆ X such that
{ϕ(un)}n>1 ⊆ R is bounded and (1 + ||un||X )ϕ′(un) → 0 in X ∗ as n → ∞,
admits a strongly convergent subsequence”.

This is a compactness-type condition on the functional ϕ and it leads to the min-
imax theory of the critical values of ϕ (see, for example, Papageorgiou, R˘adulescu
& Repovˇs [12]).

The main spaces used in the analysis of problem (Pλ) are the Sobolev space
0 (Ω) and the Banach space C1
0 (Ω) = {u ∈ C1(Ω) : u|∂Ω = 0}. By || · || we denote

0 (Ω). On account of the Poincar´e inequality we have

H 1
the norm of H 1

||u|| = ||Du||2 for all u ∈ H 1

0 (Ω).

The Banach space C1

0 (Ω) is an ordered Banach space with positive cone
0 (Ω) : u(z) > 0 for all z ∈ Ω}.

C+ = {u ∈ C1

This cone has a nonempty interior given by

int C+ =

u ∈ C+ : u(z) > 0 for all z ∈ Ω,

(cid:26)
with n(·) being the outward unit normal on ∂Ω.

∂u
∂n

|∂Ω < 0

,

(cid:27)

We will also use two other ordered Banach spaces, namely C1(Ω) and

C0(Ω) = {u ∈ C(Ω) : u|∂Ω = 0}.

The order cones are

and

ˆC+ = {u ∈ C1(Ω) : u(z) > 0 for all z ∈ Ω}

K+ = {u ∈ C0(Ω) : u(z) > 0 for all z ∈ Ω},

respectively. Both have nonempty interiors given by

D+ = {u ∈ ˆC+ : u(z) > 0 for all z ∈ Ω},
˚K+ = {u ∈ K+ : cu ˆd 6 u for some cu > 0},

with ˆd(z) = d(z, ∂Ω) for all z ∈ Ω.

Concerning ordered Banach spaces, the following result is helpful (see Papageor-

giou, R˘adulescu & Repovˇs [12, Proposition 4.1.22, p. 226]).

SINGULAR DIRICHLET PROBLEMS

Proposition 1. If X is an ordered Banach space with order (positive) cone K,
int K 6= ∅, and e ∈ int K, then for every u ∈ X, we can ﬁnd λu > 0 such that
λue − u ∈ K.

Next, we introduce the main notation which we will use in the sequel. Given

ϕ ∈ C1(H 1

0 (Ω)), we denote by Kϕ the critical set of ϕ, that is,

0 (Ω) : ϕ′(u) = 0}.
For x ∈ R, we set x± = max{±x, 0}. Given u ∈ H 1

Kϕ = {u ∈ H 1

0 (Ω), we set u±(z) = u(z)±

for all z ∈ Ω. We know that
u± ∈ H 1

0 (Ω), u = u+ − u−, |u| = u+ + u−.

Given u, y ∈ H 1

0 (Ω) with u 6 y, we deﬁne

[u, y] = {h ∈ H 1
[u) = {h ∈ H 1

0 (Ω) : u(z) 6 h(z) 6 y(z) for almost all z ∈ Ω},

0 (Ω) : u(z) 6 h(z) for almost all z ∈ Ω}.

Also, by

0 (Ω)[u, y]
intC 1
0 (Ω) in the C1

we denote the interior of [u, y] ∩ C1

0 (Ω)-norm topology.

By ˆλ1 > 0 we denote the principal eigenvalue of (−∆, H 1

0 (Ω)) and by ˆu1 the
corresponding positive L2-normalized (that is, ||ˆu1||2 = 1) eigenfunction. Standard
regularity theory and the Hopf maximum principle imply that ˆu1 ∈ int C+.

Finally, by 2∗ we denote the critical Sobolev exponent, 2∗ =

2N
N − 2
+∞
Now we will introduce our hypotheses on the perturbation f (z, x).
H(f ) : f : Ω × R → R is a Carath´eodory function such that f (z, 0) = 0 for

is nondecreasing on [0, ρ] and for every s > 0 we have

inf{f (z, x) : x > s} = ms > 0 for almost all z ∈ Ω;

(v) there exist q > 2, δ0 > 0, ˆc > 0 such that

ˆcxq−1 6 f (z, x) for almost all z ∈ Ω and all 0 6 x 6 δ0,
x2 = 0 uniformly for almost all z ∈ Ω.

N.S. PAPAGEORGIOU, V.D. R ˘ADULESCU, AND D.D. REPOVˇS

Remark 1. Since we are looking for positive solutions and all of the above hypothe-
ses concern the positive semiaxis R+ = [0, +∞), we may assume without any loss
of generality that

(1)

f (z, x) = 0 for almost all z ∈ Ω and all x 6 0.

Hypotheses H(f)(ii),(iii) imply that

lim
x→+∞

f (z, x)
x

= +∞ uniformly for almost all z ∈ Ω.

So, the perturbation f (z, ·) is superlinear. However, we do not express this super-
linearity of f (z, ·) by using the traditional (for superlinear problems) AR-condition.
We recall that the AR-condition (the unilateral version due to (1)) says that there
exist ϑ > 2 and M > 0 such that

(2a)

(2b)

0 < ϑF (z, x) 6 f (z, x)x for almost all z ∈ Ω and all x > M

0 < ess inf

Ω

F (·, M ).

Integrating (2a) and using (2b), we obtain the following weaker condition

c1xϑ 6 F (z, x) for almost all z ∈ Ω, all x > M, and some c1 > 0,

⇒ c1xϑ−1 6 f (z, x) for almost all z ∈ Ω and all x > M (see (2a)).

So, the AR-condition dictates at least (ϑ−1)-polynomial growth for f (z, ·). Here,
instead of the AR-condition, we employ hypothesis H(f )(iii) which is less restrictive
and incorporates in our framework superlinear nonlinearities with “slower” growth
near +∞. Consider the following function (for the sake of simplicity we drop the
z-dependence)

cxq−1
x ln x + cxϑ−1

if 0 6 x 6 1
if 1 < x

f (x) =

(cid:26)

with c > 0, q > 2 > ϑ > 1 (see (1)). Then f (·) satisﬁes hypotheses H(f ) but it fails
to satisfy the AR-condition.

Finally, we mention that for u ∈ H 1

0 (Ω) we have

(3)

cu ˆd 6 u for some cu > 0 if and only if ˆcu ˆu1 6 u for some ˆcu > 0.

For δ > 0 let Ωδ = {z ∈ Ω : d(z, ∂Ω) < δ} and let ˜C1(Ωδ) = {u ∈ C1(Ωδ) :

u|∂Ω = 0} with order cone

˜C1(Ωδ)+ = {u ∈ ˜C1(Ωδ) : u(z) > 0 for all z ∈ Ωδ},

which has nonempty interior given by

int ˜C1(Ωδ)+ =

u ∈ ˜C1(Ωδ)+ : u(z) > 0 for all z ∈ Ωδ and

(cid:26)

∂u
∂n

|∂Ω < 0

.

(cid:27)

According to Lemma 14.16 of Gilbarg & Trudinger [6, p. 355], for δ > 0 small
enough we have ˆd ∈ int ˜C1(Ωδ)+. Also, we have ˆd ∈ D+(Ω\Ωδ), with the latter
being the interior of the order cone of C1(Ω\Ωδ). So, using Proposition 1 we can
ﬁnd 0 < ˆc1 < ˆc2 such that ˆc1 ˆd 6 ˆu1 6 ˆc2 ˆd (recall that ˆu1 ∈ int C+). This implies
(3).

3. Positive solutions

Let η > 0. We start by considering the following auxiliary purely singular

Dirichlet problem

(Au)η

− ∆u(z) + u(z)−γ = ηˆu1(z) in Ω, u|∂Ω = 0.
By Theorem 1 of Diaz, Morel & Oswald [3] we know that for η > 0 big problem
η ∈ L1(Ω), cη ˆu1 6 vη for some

0 (Ω) ∩ C0(Ω) and v−γ

(Au)η has a solution vη ∈ H 1
cη > 0.

Also, we consider the following Dirichlet problem

(Qλ)

− ∆u(z) = λf (z, u(z)) in Ω, u|∂Ω, u > 0, λ > 0.

Proposition 2. If hypotheses H(f ) hold and λ > 0, then problem (Qλ) has a
solution ˆuλ ∈ int C+.
Proof. Let Ψλ : H 1

0 (Ω) → R be the C1- functional deﬁned by

Ψλ(u) =

1

||Du||2

2 −

ZΩ

Hypotheses H(f )(ii), (iii) imply that

λF (z, u)dz for all u ∈ H 1

0 (Ω).

(4)

Ψλ(·) satisﬁes the C-condition

(see Papageorgiou & R˘adulescu [11, Proposition 9]).

Combining hypotheses H(f )(i), (v), given ǫ > 0, we can ﬁnd cǫ > 0 such that

F (z, x) 6

ǫ

Then we have

x2 + cǫxr for almost all z ∈ Ω, all x > 0.

2 − λˆcǫ||u||r for some ˆcǫ > 0

> c2||u||2 − λˆcǫ||u||r for some c2 = c2(λ) > 0 (choose ǫ > 0 small enough),
⇒ u = 0 is a local minimizer of Ψλ(·) (recall that r > 2).

We can easily see that if u ∈ KΨλ, then u > 0. Hence we assume that KΨλ is
ﬁnite. On account of (5) and Theorem 5.7.6 of Papageorgiou, R˘adulescu & Repovˇs
[12, p. 367], we can ﬁnd ρ ∈ (0, 1) so small that

(6)

0 = Ψλ(0) < inf{Ψλ(u) : ||u|| = ρ} = mλ.

Hypothesis H(f )(ii) implies that

(7)

Ψλ(tˆu1) → −∞ as t → +∞.

Then (4), (6), (7) permit the use of the mountain pass theorem. So, we can ﬁnd

ˆuλ ∈ H 1

0 (Ω) such that

ˆuλ ∈ KΨλ and mλ 6 Ψλ(ˆuλ),
⇒ ˆuλ > 0, ˆuλ 6= 0 (see (6)).

We have

Then the semilinear regularity theory (see Gilbarg & Trudinger [6]) and the Hopf
maximum principle (see Gasinski & Papageorgiou [4]), imply that ˆuλ ∈ int C+. (cid:3)

Hypotheses H(f ) imply that we can ﬁnd c2 > 0 such that

(8)

f (z, x) > c2min{x, xq−1} for almost all z ∈ Ω and all x > 0.

We have ˆuλ ∈ int C+ and ˆuq−1

λ ∈ int K+. So, we can ﬁnd c3 > 0 such that

(9)

ηˆu1 6 c3 ˆuλ and ηˆu1 6 c3 ˆuq−1

,

λ

⇒ ηˆu1 6 c3 min{ˆuλ, ˆuq−1

From (8) and (9) we see that we can ﬁnd λ0 > 0 big such that for λ > λ0

(10)

λf (z, ˆuλ(z)) > λ0c2 min{ˆuλ(z), ˆuλ(z)q−1}
> ηˆu1(z) for almost all z ∈ Ω.

Recall that cη ˆu1 6 vη for some cη > 0. Hence by (3), ˆcη ˆd 6 vη for some ˆcη > 0.

− ∆vη(z) + vη(z)−γ = ηˆu1(z) for almost all z ∈ Ω.

If λ > λ0, from (10) and (11) we have

(12)

−∆ˆuλ(z) = λf (z, ˆuλ(z)) > ηˆu1(z) = −∆vη(z) + vη(z)−γ > −∆vη(z)
for almost all z ∈ Ω.

Since vη|∂Ω = ˆuλ|∂Ω = 0, from (12) and the weak comparison principle (see

Tolksdorf [14, Lemma 3.1]), we have

(13)

vη 6 ˆuλ

(λ > λ0).

Now we introduce the following two sets

L = {λ > 0 : problem (Pλ) has a positive solution},
Sλ = the set of positive solutions of (Pλ).

Here by a solution of (Pλ), following [10], we understand a function u ∈ H 1

0 (Ω)

such that

(a) u ∈ L∞(Ω), u(z) > 0 for almost all z ∈ Ω, and u−γ ∈ L1(Ω);
(b) there exists cu > 0 such that cu ˆd 6 u;

From (3) we know that (b) is equivalent to saying that ˆcu ˆu1 6 u for some ˆcu > 0.
Also the previous discussion reveals that (c) makes sense. Regularity theory will
provide additional structure for the solutions of (Pλ).

Proposition 3. If hypotheses H(f ) hold, then L 6= ∅ and S(λ) ⊆ int C+.

Proof. Let λ > λ0. Using (13) we can introduce the Carath´eodory function gλ(z, x)

Therefore uλ is a solution of (Pλ). We have proved that for λ > λ0 big enough,

that 0 < γ < 1). So, it follows that u

embedding theorem, we have u ∈ C1,α(Ω) with α = 1 −
u ∈ int C+ (see (19)) and so Sλ ⊆ int C+.

Next, we prove a structural property for the set L and a kind of monotonicity

property for the set Sλ with respect to λ ∈ L.

Proposition 4. If hypotheses H(f ) hold, λ ∈ L, µ > λ, and uλ ∈ Sλ ⊆ int C+,
then µ ∈ L and we can ﬁnd uµ ∈ Sµ ⊆ int C+.

Proof. Let ρ = ||uλ||∞. Hypotheses H(f ) imply that we can ﬁnd cρ > 0 such that
0 6 f (z, x) 6 cρx for almost all z ∈ Ω and all 0 6 x 6 ρ.

Also from (8) we know that

Recall that for ϑ > λ0 we have ˆuθ > vη (see (13)) and vη ∈ int K+. So, for

It follows that

see that σµ(·) is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous. So, by the Weierstrass-

This proposition implies that L is a half-line. More precisely, let λ∗ = inf L. We

have

(25)

(λ∗, +∞) ⊆ L ⊆ [λ∗, +∞).

Proposition 5. If hypotheses H(f ) hold, then λ∗ > 0.

Proof. Arguing by contradiction, suppose that λ∗ = 0. Let {λn}n>1 ⊆ L such that
λn ↓ 0 and let un ∈ Sλn ⊆ int C+ for all n ∈ N. We know that

By (28) and Theorem 1(i) of Diaz, Morel & Oswald [3] it follows that problem
(Au)η has a positive solution. Since η > 0 is arbitrary, we contradict Theorem 1(ii)
(cid:3)
of Diaz, Morel & Oswald [3]. This proves that λ∗ > 0.

Proposition 6. If hypotheses H(f ) hold and λ∗ < λ, then problem (Pλ) has at
least two positive solutions u0, ˆu ∈ int C+, u0 6= ˆu.

Proof. Let λ∗ < σ < λ < µ. On account of Proposition 4, we can ﬁnd uσ ∈ Sσ ⊆
int C+, u0 ∈ Sλ ⊆ int C+ and uµ ∈ Sλ ⊆ int C+ such that

(29)

u0 − uσ ∈ int C+ and uµ − u0 ∈ int C+,

⇒ u0 ∈ intC 1

Using (30), (31), as before (see the proof of Proposition 3), we can check that

(32)

Kβλ ⊆ [uσ) ∩ int C+ and K ˆβλ

⊆ [uσ, uµ] ∩ int C+.

Using (32), (30) and (29), we see that we may assume that

(33)

Kβλ is ﬁnite and Kβλ ∩ [uσ, uµ] = {u0}.

Otherwise, we already have additional positive solutions and so we are done.
Evidently ˆβλ(·) is coercive (see (30)). Also, it is sequentially weakly lower semi-

continuous. Thus we can ﬁnd ˆu0 ∈ H 1

0 (Ω) such that

(34)

ˆβλ(ˆu0) = inf

0 (Ω)-minimizer of βλ(·),
0 (Ω)-minimizer of βλ(·) (see [9]).

Then from (33) and Theorem 5.7.6 of Papageorgiou, R˘adulescu & Repovˇs [12,

p. 367], we know that we can ﬁnd ρ ∈ (0, 1) so small that

(35)

βλ(u0) < inf {βλ(u) : ||u − u0|| = ρ} = mλ.

Hypothesis H(f )(ii) implies that

(36)

βλ(tˆu1) → −∞ as t → +∞.

Finally, recall that hypothesis H(f )(iii) implies that

(37)

βλ(·) satisﬁes the C-condition

(see Papageorgiou & R˘adulescu [11]).

Then (35), (36), (37) permit the use of the mountain pass theorem. So, we can

ﬁnd ˆu ∈ H 1

0 (Ω) such that

ˆu ∈ Kβλ and mλ 6 βλ(ˆu),

⇒ ˆu ∈ Sλ ⊆ int C+, ˆu 6= u0 (see (32), (31) and (35)).

The proof is now complete.

(cid:3)

Summarizing, we can state the following theorem for the set of positive solutions

of problem (Pλ).

Theorem 7. If hypotheses H(f ) hold, then there exists λ∗ > 0 such that
(a) for all λ > λ∗ problem (Pλ) has at least two positive solutions

(b) for all λ ∈ (0, λ∗) problem (Pλ) has no positive solutions.

u0, ˆu ∈ int C+, u0 6= ˆu;

Remark 2. From the above Theorem is missing what happens at the critical case
λ = λ∗. We were unable to resolve this case.

If λn ↓ λ∗, then we can show that there exist un ∈ Sλn ⊆ int C+ (n ∈ N) such

that

0 (Ω), u∗ 6= 0.

It seems that λ∗ > 0 is not admissible (that is, λ∗ /∈ L, hence L = (λ∗, +∞), see

(25)), but this needs a proof.

Another open problem is the possibility of extending this work to equations
driven by the p-Laplacian. This extension requires a corresponding generalization
of the work of Diaz, Morel & Oswald [3] to the case of the p-Laplacian. However, the
tools of [3] are particular for the Laplacian. So, it is not clear how this generalization
can be achieved. Hence new techniques are needed.
