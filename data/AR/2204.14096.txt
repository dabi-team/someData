ABSTRACT

Transient recurring phenomena are ubiquitous in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds like neuroscience and me-
terology. Time inhomogenous Vector Autoregressive Models (VAR) may be used to characterize
peri-event system dynamics associated to such phenomena, and can be learned by exploiting multidi-
mensional data gathering samples of evolution of the system in multiple time windows comprising,
each associated to one occurrence of the transient phenomenon, that we will call “trial”. However,
optimal VAR model order selection methods, commonly relying on the Akaike or Bayesian Infor-
mation Criteria (AIC/BIC), are typically not designed for multi-trial data. Here we derive the BIC
methods for multi-trial ensemble data which are gathered after detection of the events. We show
using simulated bivariate AR models that the multi-trial BIC is able to recover the real model order.
We also demonstrate with simulated transient events and real data that the multi-trial BIC is able to
estimate a sufﬁciently small model order for dynamic system modelling.

Introduction

Transient dynamical events, such as weather extremes in climate science [Grotjahn et al., 2016] or reactivations of
hippocampal memory traces in the mammalian brain [Sutherland and McNaughton, 2000], are ubiquitous phenomena
in non-linear dynamical systems. Typically, they are prone to occur repetitively during speciﬁc dynamic regimes, and
may contribute to critical system level modiﬁcations. Understanding their generation mechanisms and the effects they
trigger requires precise modelling of the transient dynamics based on transient event data, i.e., the multi-trial ensemble
datasets gathered after detecting these events in the observation of the systems.

An effective way to model transient dynamics is to use time-inhomogeneous Vector Autoregressive (VAR) which
are able to approximate the non-linear dynamics in a particular region of the state space with a time-varying linear

model. After gathering a multi-trial dataset, composed of samples of the system dynamics during multiple occurrences
(named trials) of a type of event, the VAR model can be determined by estimating the model parameters with the
well-established Ordinary Least Square (OLS) or Recursive Least Square methods [Hesse et al., 2003, Möller et al.,
2001].

However, the design of appropriate VAR model order selection criterion for such multi-trial ensemble data remains
largely unaddressed. Accurate model order estimation is critical as: 1) a too low order will prevent gathering sufﬁcient
past dynamics to predict future values and lead to larger residual covariance estimates. 2) a too large order may lead to
over-ﬁtting and spurious parameter values which may affect downstream tasks (forecasting, causality analysis, ...).

Two common ways to optimize model order to model single trial signals are the Akaike information criterion (AIC)
[Akaike, 1974, 1998] and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [Gideon et al., 1978]. They both introduce a penalty
term in the log-likelihood function to compensate for the effect caused by over-ﬁtting with over-complex models. The
penalty term is dependent on the number of parameters and the sample size, and determining these two quantities causes
difﬁculties for the multi-trial case compared to the single trial case.

Previous studies proposed various methods to estimate time-varying VAR model (for an overall review see [Cekic et al.,
2018]), together with some model order selection criteria for each speciﬁc type of methods. However, they did not
provide a speciﬁc penalty term which is applicable for non-stationary and multi-trial cases. For example, Ding et al.
proposed the short windowing method which assumes local stationarity in the process [Ding et al., 2000], which is
also a ML estimator of the coefﬁcients in a time window. Model order in this study was optimized by the classical
AIC by assuming total likelihood L(p) is the product of the likelihood of each sample in all the trials. However, the
penalty term was not revised accordingly. In a study using adaptive methods [Hesse et al., 2003], a similar treatment
was applied. Another related paper suggested to perform model order selection individually for each short window, and
select the maximum order for the whole process [Möller et al., 2001]. While this idea might sound reasonable, this
likely leads to a very large model order in settings with large number of short windows. This is especially the case with
time-inhomogeneous models, where coefﬁcients are changing at each time point (i.e. window length is 1 time point).
Rajan and Rayner [1996] and Eom [1999] derived in a Bayesian approach the criteria for time-varying VAR models,
which is similar to our proposal below. However, they assume that the coefﬁcient matrix is composed of some basis
functions, and the criteria depend on the number of basis functions, which differs from the classical BIC form.

In this note, we provide an extended version of BIC appropriate for non-stationary signals with multi-trial structure.
The BIC is derived by assuming a vector autoregressive model of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of optimal
model order selection with simulated and empirical data.

2 Methods

In the Methods section, we ﬁrst deﬁne what is meant by multi-trial ensemble data and the associated VAR model. Then
the Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the model parameters are provided, together with the Hessian matrix of the
coefﬁcient matrix, as a prerequisite for further derivation of multi-trial BIC in Section 2.3.

2.1 Vector Autoregressive Modelling of Multi-trial ensemble data

For a given system (physical, biological, ...), we assume we have a long time series of d-dimensional observations
denoted ˜X t. Classically, speciﬁc patterns in the observations, referred to as events, are located in ˜X t by a detection
procedure, yielding a list of time points at which the events occur, called reference points. For each reference point tn,
the samples from the long time series ˜X t covering a ﬁxed peri-event time window tn + I of length T around tn, with
e.g. I = [−T /2, T /2 − 1] (T assumed even for simplicity), are extracted to build a two-way panel {X (n)

t(cid:48) }:

X (n)

t(cid:48) = ˜X t(cid:48)+tn , t(cid:48) ∈ I, tn ∈ T .
(1)
This panel forms the multi-trial ensemble dataset with length T and trial number N . In the following, we denote this
ensemble dataset as {X (n)
t }. These extracted trials can be
understood as repetitive realizations of the same stochastic processs, whose time-varying variable is referred to as X t.
We then assume the transient, possibly non-linear, dynamics underlying {X (n)
by a common time-inhomogeneous Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model:

t }t=1...T and the samples for all trials at time t as {X (n)

t }t=1...T can be approximated for all n

X t = AtX p,t + ηt , ηt ∼ N (kt, Σt)

where X p,t =

referred to as model order, and At is a time dependent matrix of appropriate dimension and {ηt}t∈Z is called the

innovation process. Innovations at each time points are assumed to be jointly independent n-dimensional Gaussian
random vectors. Moreover, the covariance Σt between the components is assumed diagonal.

The model is determined by the model order p and 3 model parameters: the coefﬁcient matrix At, the innovations mean
kt and the innovations covariance Σt. These model parameters are assumed time-inhomogenous, notably allowing
to approximate the non-linearity of the evolution of the system within the event time-window. Importantly, the VAR
model entails assumptions allowing the estimation of the parameters from data. Chieﬂy, the independence assumption
between innovations at different time points entails order-p Markovianity of the process, as the distribution of X t given
the whole history of the process up to time t − 1 depends only on X p,t.

2.2 Estimation of the model from data

2.2.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimation of VAR parameters

In this section we provide a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation of the model parameters for VAR(p) model described
in Section 2.1 for the multi-trial ensemble data.

For a dataset with N i.i.d trials, the likelihood function is the product of the likelihood of each sample across time
points and trials

2.2.2 Hessian of the likelihood function for the coefﬁcient matrix At

The Hessian matrix can be obtained by calculating the derivative of the ﬁrst-order derivative of the log-likelihood given
in Eq. 3, which can be rewritten as:

(10)

Notably, if N is very large and asymptotically, the covariance of p lagged-states for each time point t, supposed to be a
constant matrix with the dimension of pd, can be estimated by (cid:98)ΣX p = Ct

N , thus

Ct = N (cid:98)ΣX p .

(11)

Each entry of the matrices At, Σ−1
second-order derivative of the log-likelihood w.r.t. element aij and akm is:

and Ct at the i th row and j th column can be denoted as aij, σij, cij. Then the

(12)

The d × pd dimensional coefﬁcient matrix At can be vectorized as a pd2-dimensional vector by concatenating each
column. If the Hessian matrix is organized as H =
dvec(At)(cid:62)dvec(At) , then the Hessian matrix can be rewritten
compactly as a Kronecker product:

Ht = −Ct ⊗ Σ−1

(13)

2.3 BIC for multi-trial VAR models

2.3.1 General form for BIC

The remaining aspect to determine an optimized VAR model for the ensemble dataset is the model order. As brieﬂy
mentioned in the Introduction, classically proposed information criteria like AIC or BIC both depend on a penalized log
likelihood function with the ML estimates of model parameters (we only include the coefﬁcient matrix for simplicity as
the ML estimation of innovation statistics are dependent on (cid:99)At):

IC(p) = − log(L

(cid:16)

{X (n)

t }t=1...T |(cid:99)At

(cid:17)

) + P(p) .

(14)

The model order is selected as the order that minimizes the information criterion.

Multi-trial BIC

A PREPRINT

For a stationary d-dimensional VAR(p) model with N observations (T = 1 reﬂecting the time-invariant model), the
penalty term P(p) involves the effect of model complexity by punishing on the number of parameters, which scales as
pd2. For AIC the penalty term is proportional to the number of parameters, scaling again as P(p) = pd2. BIC takes
into account the effect of sample size L as the log-likelihood function also increases with the number of samples, and
the corresponding penalty term is P(p) = 1
2 pd2 log(N ). As AIC often provides over-simpliﬁed models, we focus in
the following sections on characterising BIC in different conditions.

2.3.2 Derivation of the multi-trial ensemble BIC

The challenge to apply BIC for the multi-trial case is to decide on the number of parameters and the sample size. Naive
ideas that there are T · pd2 parameters and N T samples might be misleading as the multi-trial samples are modelled
with different asymptotic assumptions. Precisely, the stationary case assumes N i.i.d. samples from a time-invariant
model with pd2 parameters, while the time-varying model, consisting of T · pd2 parameters is estimated from N i.i.d.
samples at each time point t (with t = 1 . . . T ). Despite previous attempts reviewed in Introduction, we propose here an
extended version of BIC that is appropriate for non-stationary signals with multi-trial structures with the penalty term
as P(p) = 1

2 T pd2 log(N )). The derivation is the following.

From a probabilistic perspective, the optimal model order p should maximize the likelihood function given the data, i.e.
maximize p({X (n)
t }t=1...T |p). This likelihood is different from the likelihood function we derived in Section 2.2.1,
i.e. p({X (n)
t }|(cid:99)At, p) as the later is jointly parameterized by a point estimate (cid:99)At of the At matrices given the p-
ordered model. By using instead a conditional p((cid:99)At|p) for this set of parameters, we approximate the likelihood
p({X (n)

t }t=1...T |p) with a Laplace approximation:

p({X (n)

t }t=1...T |p) =

Meanwhile, the determinant of the Hessian matrix is

(18)

Then taking into account the assumptotic property of Ct in Eq. 11, the logarithm of the determinant of the Hessian
matrix is

log |Ht| = d log |Ct| − pd log |(cid:99)Σt| = d log |N (cid:98)ΣX p | − pd log |(cid:99)Σt| = pd2 log(N ) + d log |(cid:98)ΣX p | − pd log |(cid:99)Σt| . (19)

As the trial number N increases while trial length T remains constant, the likelihood function in Eq. 24 can be

(21)

Comparing with the general form of BIC in Eq. 14, we now obtain a penalty term pd2T log(N ), such that in our case
the number of parameters of BIC is pd2T and the sample size is N . In practice, this can be estimated from data as

log p({X (n)

(22)

The quantity in Eq. 22 deﬁnes what we refer to as "ensemble BIC" in later sections. A more precise way to determine
the model order is to compare the complete form, which we refer to as "ensemble BIC (full)":

log p({X (n)

Normally, the ensemble BIC (but not the full version) is sufﬁcient to obtain an optimized model order for empirical
multi-trial panel data. We will also demonstrate in the Results section that the model order obtained by both ensemble
BIC forms are almost identical.

2.3.3 A special case for ensemble BIC within a 1-point time window

Finally, we check the special case where the same multi-trial ensemble dataset is modelled by a time-invariant model
VAR(p) model. In this case, Eq. 24 is revised as

log p({X (n)

t }t=1...T |p) ≈ log p({X (n)

t }t=1...T |(cid:99)At, p) + log p((cid:99)At|p) +

pd2
2

log(2π) −

log |Ht| ,

(24)

where the last term is

log |H| = d log |N T (cid:98)ΣX p | − pd log |(cid:99)Σt| = pd2 log(N T ) + d log |(cid:98)ΣX p | − pd log |(cid:99)Σt| .

(25)

Therefore, the penalty term should be: pd2 log(N T ), consistently with the classical BIC.

Theoretically there is not constraint to use the same model order for each 1-point time window, i.e. at each time point
we are free to estimate an VAR(p) model with different model orders. However, ﬁnding a single optimal model order
for the whole ensemble data facilitates the calculation of more advanced statistics, e.g. causality measures like the
causal strength [Janzing et al., 2013].

3 Results

In this section, we tested the proposed ensemble BIC for different types of panel data, ranging from simulational data
with known model orders to experimental data. The ensemble BIC is well-validated with multi-trial ensembles where
all trials are generated by the same time-varying model. We will also point out that the estimated model orders are

The events are constructed by designing a time-varying non-zero innovation mean as a deterministic perturbation of the
system. Practically, at the peri-event window of the cause variable X 2
t (centered at time tn), the innovations mean is
set as a 200-ms-long morlet-shaped waveform with the amplitude of 5 and 10, such that a strong oscillatory event is
elicited in both variables. We refer to these events in the following as "Perturbation events". We simulated 5000 such
events in a long VAR(4) time series with an interval uniformly distributed between 200 and 800ms.

To validate the effectivity of the proposed ensemble BIC method for model order selection, we ﬁrst extracted all the
events based on the window surrouding their ground-truth reference points as designed, such that each trial is an
indepedent sample of the same time-varying model. The statistics of the extracted ensemble are shown in Figure 1A,
B (top left). Figure 1A, B (bottom left) show the BIC curves for this ground-truth event panel, both for the proposed
ensemble BIC as in Eq. 24 and Eq. 22 and the full version as deﬁned in Eq. 23. Clearly, the estimated model order
coincides with the real model order 4, thus illustrating that the ensemble BIC is able to recover the real model order for
multi-trial-panel data.

However, in real data analysis of spontaneous events, one rarely has access to the real locations of the events. Therefore
events are detected and aligned (a procedure as brieﬂy described in the Methods section). Here we perform the
BIC-based model order selection procedure on panel data detected and aligned based on different variables, i.e., either
the cause variable X 2

t and the effect variable X 1
t .

Based on either variable, the detection is performed by ﬁltering the signal with a 49-ordered FIR ﬁlter in the range
of 50-70Hz (as designed to be the feature frequency band of these perturbation events). A threshold of 3 times the
standard deviation over the mean of the full ﬁltered signal is then set to determine the rough location of the events,
and the reference points tn are then determined by all time points over the threshold. Then the panel is collected by
extracting the original signals in a peri-tn window of 200-ms length. The statistics of the panel aligned by the effect X 1
t
are shown in Figure 1A,B(top,middle) for perturbation amplitude of 5 and 10 separately, while corresponding statistics
of the panel aligned by the cause X 2

t is reﬂected in Figure 1A,B(top, right).

Interestingly, for the case where perturbation amplitude is 5, ensemble BIC selects the ground-truth model order fo
all the three alignment conditions, while for the events where perturbation is stronger (amplitude=10), ensemble BIC
fails to recover the real model orders. Both estimated model orders for panels aligned by the effect and the cause are
higher than the real model order, and the estimated model order for panels aligned by the effect is more overestimated
than the other case. We will see that this phenomenon persists in following experiments. We will discuss the potential
mechanisms in Discussions.

3.2 Application on hippocample Sharp Wave-Ripples from CA3 to CA1

Sharp Wave-Ripple (SPW-R) events, hypothesized as a key elements implementing memory consolidation in the brain,
has been reported in the electrophysiological recordings within the hippocampus of both macaques and rodents.

In this section, we applied the ensemble BIC method to an open source dataset where the CA3 and CA1 regions of
rodent hippocampus has been recordedMizuseki et al. [2014]. The coupling between the CA3 and CA1 regions has
hypothetized to be uni-directional, i.e., CA3→CA1, according to both anatomical basis [Csicsvari et al., 2000] as well
as data analysis results [Shajarisales et al., 2015]. Sharp Wave-Ripples (SPW-Rs) has been reported in both regions,
while we detect SPW-Rs from the datasets and align by different regions, forming two panels for BIC-based model
order selection.

The SPW-R events are detected from concatenated Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings in two sessions of a rat
named ’vvp01’ with the same electrode implantations. The sampling rate is 1252Hz. The signals are recorded with a
4-shank probe at each region consisting 8 channels for each shank, thus obtaining 32 channels for each region.

Following Mizuseki et al. [2009], the detection is performed with an 49-ordered FIR ﬁlter in the frequency band
[140,230]Hz. Similar to Section 3.1, we set a threshold as 5 times the standard devidation over the mean of the ﬁltered
signals to locate the events and align them according to all points over the threshold. The peri-event window has been
chosen to be [-400, 200]ms to fascilitate more advanced analysis after estimating the best model order. Panels for
different alignment conditions are obtained by performing the detection procedure for a single-channel of either region
and extracted with the combination of another channel in the other region. Therefore, we obtain 1024 panels for all
channel pairs for each alignment conditions. The average statistics of all panels for each alignment condition are plotted
in Figure 2 (top).

Consistent with Section 3.1, for each alignment conditions, we estimated the optimized model order for each channel
pair with the proposed ensemble BIC and the full version, resulting in 2 groups of 1024 best model orders. The BIC
curves of an example channel pair with two alignment conditions are plotted in Figure 2(middle). The best orders
estimated by the full version in Eq 23 for the panel aligned by the cause region (CA3) is slightly smaller than the

The histograms displayed in Figure 2(bottom) match this observation, suggesting that the model order for panels aligned
by the effect might be more biased. This is consistent with moder order rank in the perturbation events in Section 3.1.

3.3 Application on hippocampal Sharp-Wave Ripples between the Striatum Radiatum and CA1

Similar to Section 3.2, we applied the ensemble BIC methods to simultaneous recordings in macaque hippocampus in
the region stratum radiatum and the pyramidal layers in CA1, where SPW-Rs can be detected by ﬁltering the original
signals in the frequency band 90-190Hz following a similar procedure.

In this dataset, 4 channels are identiﬁed for each region, thus leading to 16 channel pairs. We performed similar analysis
procedure as in Similar to Section 3.2, resulting in 16 panels for each alignment condition. Thus similarly, the panel
statistics averaged across channel pairs are represented in Figure 4 (top). BIC curves in an example channel pairs for
different alignment conditions are shown in Figure 4 (middle), while the histograms of best model orders across channel
pairs are plotted in Figure 4 (bottom).

While the connection between the stratum radiatum and the CA1 pyramidal layers is considered to be uni-directional,
previous studies (Ramirez-Villegas et al. [2018]) suggested with modelling approaches the existence of interactions in
the opposite direction. Regardless of the true causal direction, we still observe slightly higher best model orders when
the panels are aligned by the pyramidal layer compared to aligned by the stratum radiatum.

4 Discussion

In general, we have adapted the well-documented BIC method for model order selection to multi-trial ensemble data.
based on VAR(p) models. Speciﬁcally, we propose that the equivalent parameters in the classical time-invariance BIC
form to be pd2T for the number of parameters and N to be the sample size for time-varying panel models. The BIC
methods has been validated with multi-trial events simulated with an time-varying VAR(4) models, suggesting that the
proposed ensemble BIC is an effective tool for determining complexity in dynamical modelling.

Besides, we found that when different trials in a panel is aligned by one of the variables, the ensemble BIC fail to
recover the true model order. However, this is critical as aligning is a common precedure for analyzing spontaneous
events, thus should be addressed to achieve a practical use of the ensemble BIC. Here we brieﬂy discuss the underlying
mechanism. From the perspective of a causal diagram, as seen in Figure 4, alignment is equivalent to adding a selection
node to either the cause or the effect variable. After detection with a thresholding procedure, the S node can be seen as
observed, thus affecting the other dependencies in the diagram (reﬂected by the errors). Simply put, with d-separation it
is clear that observing S induces spurious dependencies between nodes before time t but does not affect the nodes after
t. Therefore, the VAR model estimation will be biased, leading to wrong estimation of the likelihood function in e.g.,
Eq. 22. Aligning by the cause is slightly less biased compared to aligning by the effect because the coupling dependence
is not affected by the selection. Therefore, further studies should be conducted to correct for the selection bias in order
to obtain an appropriate model order to model the time-varying dynanmics in modelling event-based panels.
