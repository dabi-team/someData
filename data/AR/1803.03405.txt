ABSTRACT

We present results from an observing campaign in support of the VAULT2.0 sounding
rocket launch on September 30, 2014. VAULT2.0 is a Lyα (1216 ˚A) spectroheliograph
capable of providing spectroheliograms at high cadence. Lyα observations are highly
complementary to the IRIS observations of the upper chromosphere and the low tran-
sition region (TR) but have previously been unavailable. The VAULT2.0 data provide
new constraints on upper-chromospheric conditions for numerical models. The observ-
ing campaign was closely coordinated with the IRIS mission. Taking advantage of this

simultaneous multi-wavelength coverage of target AR 12172 and by using state-of-the-
art radiative-MHD simulations of spicules, we investigate in detail a type-II spicule
associated with a fast (300 km s−1) network jet recorded in the campaign observations.
Our analysis suggests that spicular material exists suspended high in the atmosphere
but in lower temperatures (seen in Lyα) until it is heated and becomes visible in TR
temperatures as a network jet. The heating begins lower in the spicule and propagates
upwards as a rapidly propagating thermal front. The front is then observed as fast,
plane-of-the-sky motion typical of a network jet, but contained inside the pre-existing
spicule. This work supports that the high speeds reported in network jets should not be
taken as real mass upﬂows but only as apparent speeds of a rapidly propagating heating
front along the pre-existing spicule.

1.

Introduction

The chromosphere is one of the least understood layers of the solar atmosphere because of
our limited understanding of the governing physical processes. In the last ten to ﬁfteen years, the
chromosphere has been propelled to the forefront of solar physics research thanks to spectacular new
observations from space with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT; Tsuneta et al. 2008) onboard the
HINODE spacecraft, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al. 2014),
the Very high Angular resolution Ultraviolet Telescope (VAULT; Korendyke et al. 2001), and
from the ground with the Dutch Open Telescope (DOT; Rutten et al. 2004), the Interferometric
Bidimensional Spectropolarimeter (IBIS; Cavallini 2006), and the 1-m Swedish Solar Telescope
(SST; Scharmer et al. 2003), in particular with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP;
Scharmer et al. 2008). The advent of sophisticated numerical simulations, which are beginning
to address the complex physics of the optically thick chromospheric plasmas, has helped in the
interpretation of the observations (e.g. Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2017a).

A new class of spicules (type-II spicules) has been discovered in Hinode/SOT Ca II H obser-
vations (De Pontieu et al. 2007). They seem to exhibit much faster speeds as compared to the
“traditional” class of type-I spicules (50 − 100 km s−1). In Ca II H ﬁltergrams, type-II spicules
appear to be shorter lived (typical lifetimes 10-150 s) than type-I spicules whereas for higher chro-
mospheric temperatures, e.g., Mg II h & k formation temperatures or TR temperatures, e.g., Si IV,
the lifetimes are 3-10 minutes (Pereira et al. 2014). These spicules are rooted in the chromospheric
network and consequently, due to their ubiquity, they are regarded as a signiﬁcant source of coronal
mass and heat transfer (De Pontieu et al. 2009). Tian et al. (2014) studied counterparts to spicules
in the IRIS FUV SJI channels and called them “network jets”. They measured the plane-of-the-sky
speeds with the aid of space-time plots and reported speeds of ≈ 80 to 250 km s−1. They concluded
that due to these very fast speeds, network jets could be a signiﬁcant source of mass to the solar
wind. On the other hand, Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2015) using SST and IRIS observations,
studied the heating signatures of on-disk type-II spicules and they found that many type-II spicules

– 3 –

on the disk are associated with network jets. In addition, they provided Doppler speeds of these
on-disk type-II spicules. These speeds (50-75 km s−1) seem to disagree with the speeds of Tian
et al. (2014), despite the similar viewing angles. This discrepancy raises the important question
on whether the high speeds reported by Tian et al. (2014) are apparent speeds and not true mass
upﬂows. De Pontieu et al. (2017) used the state-of-the-art simulations of Mart´ınez-Sykora et al.
(2017a) and suggested that the speeds of the network jets are likely not caused by real mass motions,
but by heating fronts that propagate with those speeds. The network jet speeds would then be un-
derstood as apparent speeds (and not real mass motions). This can resolve the discrepancy between
the plane-of-the sky motions in images and the line-of-sight velocities from Doppler measurements.

In this paper, we derive new observational constraints from VAULT2.0 and IRIS coordinated
observations. The VAULT2.0 rocket experiment (Very high Angular resolution Ultraviolet Tele-
scope 2.0; Vourlidas et al. 2016) is a Lyα spectroheliograph designed to observe the upper chro-
mospheric region of the solar atmosphere in high spatial (∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48)) and temporal resolution (8 s).
VAULT2.0 is a reﬂight of the VAULT rocket and was successfully launched on September 20,
2014 from White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The VAULT2.0 experiment was complemented
by an observing “campaign” from ground-based (BBSO, IBIS/NSO, SOLIS) and space-borne
(SDO/AIA/HMI, IRIS, HINODE /EIS/SOT) observatories. The importance of the addition of
VAULT2.0 Lyα observations is that Lyα is formed at a location in the spectrum where the UV
continuum is low, essentially allowing imaging with relatively low photospheric contamination and
thus high contrast due to suppressed background emission. This is critical when seeking the on-disk
counterparts of type-II spicules.

This paper is organized as follows:

in section 2 we describe the joint VAULT2.0 and IRIS
observations of a type-II spicule, in section 3 we discuss the numerical model used to interpret the
observations followed by a discussion in section 4. We conclude in section 5.

2. Campaign Observations

The VAULT2.0 observing window lasted for about ﬁve minutes (18:09 - 18:14 UT). However,
the campaign observations were initiated several hours before and concluded a few hours after
VAULT2.0 ﬂight. During its ﬂight, VAULT2.0 observed a failed eruption and captured cooling
downﬂows and bright ribbons around the target AR12172 (Chintzoglou et al. 2017). At the time
of the ﬂight the AR was at heliographic coordinates S15◦W55◦. The VAULT2.0 large (384(cid:48)(cid:48)×256(cid:48)(cid:48))
Field of View (FOV), captured substantial areas of quiet Sun (QS) around the target AR. The
spatial resolution was determined post-ﬂight ((cid:46) 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)2; Vourlidas et al. 2016) and 34 images were
recorded at an 8 s cadence.

IRIS supported the observational campaign by providing fast time-cadence (13 sec) image series
from its slit-jaw imagers (in short, SJI). IRIS was in a “sparse” (1(cid:48)(cid:48) separation) 8-step raster mode
(obs-id 3820255277), centered at (x,y)=(711(cid:48)(cid:48), -281(cid:48)(cid:48)) and observed the target between 17:13 - 20:04

– 4 –

UT. The SJI passbands covered the lower TR at 1400 ˚A (dominated by Si IV ion emission) and
at 1330 ˚A (dominated by C II ion emission) with mean formation temperatures of ≈ 80,000 K and
≈ 30,000 K respectively (see Rathore & Carlsson (2015) for further discussion on the dominant
temperatures of plasma emission in C II 1330 ˚A). The FOV of these IRIS SJI images (120(cid:48)(cid:48)×120(cid:48)(cid:48))
is smaller than that of VAULT2.0, but large enough to contain the core of the target AR as well
as some QS region north and south of the AR. The SJI pixel size is 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)167 pix−1 and the data were
corrected for ﬂat-ﬁeld, dark current and geometric distortions as described in De Pontieu et al.
(2014). In Figure 1 we show the FOVs of each instrument superimposed on a 304 ˚A context image
from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2011) onboard the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). Qualitatively the Lyα observations show similarities in
structures observed with the 304 ˚A passband of SDO/AIA and also with the SJI 1400 ˚A and 1330 ˚A
passbands of IRIS (compare panels a and b of Figure 1). In the QS the chromospheric network is
the dominant structure while in the location of the AR an inverse U-shape ﬁlament is seen as a
dark feature, surrounded by emission from the nearby plage.

Since the campaign includes only on-disk observations, we restricted our eﬀorts in ﬁnding
type-II spicules on-disk. This restriction, combined with the relatively small IRIS SJI FOV, made
for a challenging analysis since spicules are best seen against low background emission (which is
best for spicules at the limb). After carefully inspecting the image series in the common FOV of
VAULT2.0 and IRIS for spicules, we identiﬁed a fast network jet in the IRIS 1400 ˚A and 1330 ˚A
passbands in the south of AR12172 (green box in Figure 1). In Figure 2 we show three snapshots
of the area around the network jet. The 20(cid:48)(cid:48)×30(cid:48)(cid:48) FOV contains chromospheric material with both
dark and bright features (see Figure 1). These features form a darker background against which a
sudden brightening, typical of a network jet, can be identiﬁed on-disk. The network jet is shown in
the bottom right panel of Figure 2 (indicated with a white arrow). Based on the SJI images, the
width of the jet is ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5.

The space-time plot of Figure 3 shows a parabolic proﬁle (visible in both IRIS passbands
but best seen in Si IV 1400 ˚A due to its better signal-to-noise ratio). This is compatible with the
presence of a type II spicule, with the bright TR emission outlining the spatial extent of the spicular
material, as also shown in De Pontieu et al. (2017). This may be associated with a heating front
at TR temperatures as it travels along the spicule’s axis (Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2017a). When
the spicule is fully evolved (∼ 40 s later), it brightens along its whole length (18:13:08 UT) in the
1400 ˚A and 1330 ˚A SJI images. Emission re-occurs about a minute after the ﬁrst peak of emission,
at 18:14:40 UT. This resurgence leaves two almost vertical streaks in the space-time plot of 1400 ˚A
and 1330 ˚A in Figure 3. Their vertical extent corresponds to the length of the spicule, ∼ 4 Mm
projected on the plane of the sky. From these space time plots we deduce an apparent speed of
∼ 300 km s−1.

The VAULT2.0 observations reveal a slighlty diﬀerent behavior than the IRIS observations.
Lyα emission peaks simultaneously with the Si IV 1400 ˚A and C II 1330 ˚A emission as shown in the
space-time plots of Figure 3. However, while the apparent parabolic proﬁles in the IRIS passbands

develop, there is sudden Lyα emission over the full length of the spicule for up to 120 s before
the ﬁrst brightening in 1400 ˚A and 1330 ˚A at 18:13:48 UT (emission between the 18:12 and 18:14
vertical bar, top left panel in Figure 3). The feature can be seen in the VAULT2.0 frame in the
middle top panel of Figure 2 (red dashed circle). In addition, the Lyα structure has the same linear
extent as the IRIS-observed type-II spicule, which suggests that material appears to pre-exist at
the location where the network jet occurs, but at temperatures lower than the TR temperatures
observed by IRIS.

The measured plane-of-the-sky speed of ∼ 300 km s−1 lies on the high-end of the speeds of
network jets reported by Tian et al. (2014) and Narang et al. (2016). In this particular case, the
brigthening is happening in a spicule in an active region. In the following section, we are going to
investigate this case with an advanced radiative MHD model.

3. Bifrost Model of a Spicule

To address the questions raised by our analysis we compare the observations to simulated
spicules (Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2017a). The Bifrost code (Gudiksen et al. 2011) solves the MHD
equations while including the radiative losses (Hayek et al. 2010; Carlsson & Leenaarts 2012),
thermal conduction along the magnetic ﬁeld and the ion-neutral interaction eﬀects by adding the
ambipolar diﬀusion and the Hall term in the induction equation (Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2012, 2017b
for details on the ambipolar diﬀusion on these models). This model solves the single-ﬂuid MHD
In short, in a partially ionized
equations and takes into account ion-neutral interaction eﬀects.
magnetized gas, the ambipolar diﬀusion describes the decoupling of the bulk of the ﬂuid with
magnetic ﬂux. This is a consequence of neutrals being able to move “freely” while ions are coupled
to the magnetic ﬁeld. Due to collisions, ions can also be decoupled from the magnetic ﬁeld. Note
that the ambipolar diﬀusion allows to diﬀuse the magnetic ﬁeld and dissipates magnetic energy
into thermal energy. This numerical model is capable of self-consistently producing type-II spicules
(Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2017a).

The simulation analyzed here is the 2.5D radiative MHD model described in detail in Mart´ınez-
Sykora et al. (2016); Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. (2017a). The numerical domain ranges from the upper
layers of the convection zone (3 Mm below the photosphere) to the self-consistently maintained hot
corona (40 Mm above the photosphere) and 90 Mm along the horizontal axis. The spatial resolution
is 14 km along the horizontal axis. For the vertical direction, the grid is non-uniform allowing a ﬁner
grid size in locations where it is necessary to resolve features, such as in the photosphere to the TR,
and coarser in the corona and deeper into the convection zone (i.e. variable grid size ranging from
12−50 km). This simulation shows the formation of very fast network jets seen in synthesized Si IV
emission (De Pontieu et al. 2017). In addition, we derive synthetic Lyα observables to interpret
the thermal evolution from the observations.

For this work we calculated the synthetic Si IV intensity assuming ionization equilibrium and

with the IRIS slit-jaw imager in Si IV 1400 ˚A (middle row) and C II 1330 ˚A (bottom row). The FOV
corresponds to the green box of Figure 1. Intensities for each passband I are normalized as I/Imax
with Imax the strongest intensity in the FOV of the entire time series. Scaling is logarithmic (base
10) for all panels. The sharp dark features in the IRIS FOVs are particles on the slit-jaw detector.
The network jet occurs at the time shown in the last columns of Si IV 1400 ˚A and C II 1330 ˚A. The
Lyα counterpart of the network jet is shown inside the red dashed circle in the top row and it seems
to pre-exist (at least in panel at 18:11:54 UT) before the appearance of the network jet (compare
content in red dashed circles between wavelengths). The green dashed rectangle shown in panel
18:13:54 marks the area containing the network jet and the blue dashed rectangle marks the area
intersecting the network jet at a 90◦ angle. Pixels along the dark lines inside these locations are
used in the space-time plots of Figure 3.

18:13:54). Left panels (a, b, c) show the evolution of the brightenings along slit 1 for each passband
and the right panels show the evolution along slit 2, i.e. at a cross-section with the network jet.
To guide the eye with reference to Figure 2, we show the intersection of the rectangular area of slit
2 with slit 1 as blue dashed lines. Similarly, in the right panels we show with green dashed lines
the area around slit 1 as intersected by slit 2 (containing the cross section of the network jet once
it occurs). Intensity scaling is logarithmic (base 10). Times when VAULT2.0 was not observing
are shown with black color. The bottom part of the spicule is at the top of slit. In the 1400 ˚A and
1330 ˚A space-time plots we see that the type II spicule manifests itself in the form of a parabolic
trace (yellow dotted curve superposed in all left panels for reference). The spicule seems to undergo
a recurring second brightening along its length 40 s after the ﬁrst brightening, also shown in 1216 ˚A.
The selected times of the panels in Figure 2 are shown with white vertical lines. The type-II spicule
in Lyα shows emission preceding the sudden brightening/network jets seen in IRIS by almost two
minutes (panel a; arrow pointing to location above parabolic trace).

optically thin approximation as in Hansteen et al. (2010). Lyα proﬁles were calculated in detail
by solving the full non-LTE radiative transfer problem on a column by column basis with the
RH 1.5D code (Uitenbroek 2001; Pereira & Uitenbroek 2015). A ﬁve-level plus continuum model
hydrogen atom was used. The 1.5D approximation was used to keep the computational costs
down. To compare with VAULT2.0 observations, we integrated the synthetic Lyα line proﬁles over
a Gaussian bandpass with 80˚A FWHM. Because of this integration, the mean intensity is more
important than the spectral line shapes. While Lyα suﬀers from partial redistribution (PRD) eﬀects
(Milkey & Mihalas 1973), testing a single snapshot we ﬁnd that when using the 1.5D approximation,
calculations assuming complete redistribution (CRD) give a mean intensity that is closer to the full
3D PRD approach. The reason is that PRD reduces the intensity in the line wings, while 3D eﬀects
do the opposite (Sukhorukov & Leenaarts 2017). Therefore, our adopted 1.5D CRD approach gives
a reasonable approximation when studying wavelength-integrated Lyα proﬁles.

In Figure 4 we present temperature maps from the simulation at three consecutive instances of
the type-II spicule (panels a, b, and c) and synthesized Lyα and Si IV emergent intensities in space-
time plots (as observed from the top of the box). Similarly to the observations in Si IV, a bright
point-like front travels with the growing spicule as seen in the space-time plots (forming a parabolic
proﬁle, yellow dotted envelope in panels d and f). This is arises from a moving front of TR emission
at the top of the spicule (panel a), enhancing the emissivity in both simulated passbands (Lyα and
Si IV). However, up to that time, in the region enclosed by the yellow-dotted parabolic envelope
(inside green dashed oval 1 in panels d and e), there seems to be an order of magnitude diﬀerence
in the normalized intensities between Lyα and Si IV, with Lyα emission being higher than Si IV.
This enhanced emissivity of Lyα comes from the spicular column (above τ = 1), similarly to the
enhanced emission seen in the observed Lyα space time proﬁle before the occurrence of the network
jet in Si IV (panel a and b in Figure 3). Then, at ∼990 s a sudden brightening occurs along the
whole spicule in Si IV (and Lyα) caused by a sudden temperature increase (up to ∼ 104 K) in a
very narrow region on the right hand side of the spicule (panel b). This corresponds to the bright
linear feature inside the dashed oval 2 in the space time plots in panels d and e.

In the temperature panels, the formation height of Lyα (τ = 1, shown with black solid line
in panels a-c) is exactly at the location of the region which undergoes the temperature increase
(dashed oval, panel b). Around 70 s later (t=1080 s; dashed oval 3 in space-time plots in panels
d and e) a second emission enhancement occurs associated with an increase of temperature to
∼ 104 K of most of the spicular plasma (panel c, dashed oval).

To further investigate the physical processes responsible for the simulated event, we explored
the Joule Heating (left column, Figure 5), electrical current (|J|, middle), and ambipolar diﬀusion
(right) at selected times before the times of the panels a, b, and c of Figure 4. An electrical current
is traveling within the chromosphere (directed from right to left as seen in Figure 4) at Alfv´enic
speeds. At t = 928 s the current front is at x ≈ 70.8 Mm (shown with a dashed oval in panel b)
and at t = 990 s has spread out along the very right hand side of the spicule (inside oval in panel
e). Due to ambipolar diﬀusion (Figure 5, right column) the current is dissipated rapidly and heats

(shown with black lines in panels d,e). The horizontal dimension, x, is placed in the vertical axis to
account for a spicule that grows southward (as in the observations). The photospheric surface is at
z=0. The black curve shows the height of τ =1 for the peak intensity of Lyα for an observer viewing
from the top-down towards the solar surface (in this arrangement of the maps, the observer’s view is
from right to left). While spicular material is already suspended up to 6 Mm from the photosphere,
Lyα emission comes from diﬀerent parts along the spicule as it heats up. Panels d-e: Lyα and Si IV

evolving spicule (yellow dotted curve). Note the higher normalized intensity of Lyα as compared
to Si IV (inside the green dashed oval 1; before the ﬁrst network jet). The occurence of the network
jets is marked with white dashed ovals 2 and 3 (see text).

the plasma (left panels) in a very localized region along the spicule. The heating time scale of a
few seconds is a result of the rapid propagation and of the rapid dissipation of the currents, i.e.,
at an Alfv´en speed between 300-500 km s−1. Following this Alfv´enic wave, a wider current front is
covering most of the spicule at t = 1050 s.

4. Discussion

The existence of material in Lyα temperatures before the manifestation of network jets chal-
lenges the idea that the plane-of-the-sky motions of network jets are real mass motions of spicules
seen in the TR. Previously, Tian et al. (2014) and Narang et al. (2016) performed a statistical study
of a large sample of network jets seen in IRIS C II by measuring the plane-of-the-sky speeds and
they found a distribution of speeds between 80-300 km s−1. Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2015),
conducted an analysis of the heating signatures of on-disk type-II spicules using Hα data from the
SST with Si IV and C II from IRIS. In their work they reported Doppler velocities much lower than
those in Tian et al. (2014), i.e. 50-75 km s−1. We should stress here that both studies dealt with
on-disk case of network jets and type-II spicules, with similar viewing angles. The diﬀerence in
the reported speeds between the two studies is striking. One would expect a close match of speeds
deduced by the two methods (i.e. plane-of-the-sky speeds and Doppler-deduced speeds) if those
motions were real mass motions. If there are real mass motions of ∼ 150 − 300 km s−1 then, given
that network jets are observed to be roughly radially oriented, then the doppler speeds should reveal
these speeds or at least show an order-of-magnitude agreement. The observations from VAULT2.0
and IRIS suggest that type-II spicules pre-exist at temperatures visible in Lyα, and that some of the
plasma in these type-II spicules suddenly gets heated to higher, TR temperatures, which is revealed
as rapidly propagating linear features in the TR passbands observed by IRIS (i.e. network jets).
That is, our analysis does not support the interpretation that the speeds are real mass motions but
rather suggests that they arise from thermal fronts, which heat the spicular plasma.

Furthermore, we conclude that since type-II spicules seem to have much lower mass ﬂow speeds
than the apparent speeds of network jets (which are not mass ﬂows), this may also have implications
for estimates of the contributions of spicules to the solar wind mass ﬂux. As discussed in Tian et al.
(2014), using a mean jet speed from their sample of 150 km s−1 they estimate a spicular contribution
to the solar wind of (2.8 - 36.4)×1012 g s−1 if all mass of the network jets contributes to the solar
wind. In addition, they acknowledge that the lack of coronal observations of suﬃcient sensitivity
makes it diﬃcult to assess whether the aforementioned rate is realistic contribution to the solar
wind. They concluded that the above mass contribution rate is ≈ 2 to 24 times larger than the total
mass loss associated with the solar wind (ranging from 1.2 - 1.9 × 1012 between solar minimum
and solar maximum respectively). Using the same assumptions here, we would argue that by using
the conservative Doppler speeds of about 50 km s−1 (as measured in the analysis of Rouppe van
der Voort et al. (2015) on type-II spicules) as to be a more realistic measure for the mass upﬂows
in type-II spicules (instead of the apparent speeds of network jets), this would reduce the values

part of the spicule (dashed ovals in panels d,g).

to about a third, i.e. ≈ 0.6 - 8 times the total loss rate of the solar wind. However, neither the
Tian et al. (2014) values nor these values may be an accurate measure of the mass contributing
to the solar wind, since it is not known what fraction of the spicular mass is heated to million
degree temperatures. We need to stress here that addressing the question of spicular contribution
to the solar wind in the way of Tian et al. (2014) is complicated by the fact that, just like with
coronal heating, the contribution of the spicules may not be limited to just providing mass, but
could also include generation and propagation of currents, which can then dissipate in the wind
and lead to extra evaporation. Indeed, parabolic proﬁles usually suggest that the suspended mass
comes down. Our observations, with unique temperature coverage and spatiotemporal resolution,
support the view presented in De Pontieu et al. (2017), i.e. that network jets are primarily apparent
plane-of-the-sky motions arising from enhanced emission of rapidly propagating heating fronts along
pre-existing spicules, rather than actual mass motion upwards.

5. Conclusion

We observed the occurrence of a type-II spicule in the common FOVs of VAULT2.0 and IRIS
SJI imagers. The spicule contains Lyα material at lower intensities for about two minutes prior
to its counterpart in Si IV and C II (Figures 2 and 3). Once the type-II spicule reaches TR
temperatures, it brightens twice within 52 s in all three passbands (Figure 3).

We employed a state-of-the-art 2.5D MHD Bifrost simulation of a type-II spicule (Mart´ınez-
Sykora et al. 2017a). According to this model, ambipolar diﬀusion facilitates the dissipation of
electrical currents whithin the type-II spicules causing the temperature to increase rapidly. The
synthesis of observables from this simulation shows precedence of signiﬁcant emission for Lyα as
compared to Si IV emission in the spicule. The rapid temperature changes have an impact on the
emissivity of the diﬀerent ions. Two brightenings in the same spicule arise from two episodes of
current dissipation within the spicule.

In conclusion, the precedence of Lyα emission two minutes before the brightening in Si IV
1400 ˚A and C II 1330 ˚A points to the existence of a “Lyα counterpart” for the network jets. Our
unique observations elucidate the heating process and the morphology of the type-II spicules. De
Pontieu et al. (2017) have provided evidence that the speeds of network jets reported by Tian et al.
(2014) and Narang et al. (2016) are not true jet speeds and conversely not mass upﬂows at those
speeds. Our analysis of VAULT2.0 observations provides additional evidence in agreement with De
Pontieu et al. (2017) and suggests that spicular material pre-exists at chromospheric temperatures
as a Lyα spicule. That spicule heats up to TR temperatures due to rapidly moving heating front
which results in the apparent (and not real mass motion) speeds in the form of fast network jets
within the same spicule.
