ABSTRACT
We detect four very energetic outﬂows in the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origin Spectrograph
spectra of quasar 2MASS J1051+1247 with a combined kinetic luminosity ( ˙EK) of 1046 erg s−1. Re-
markable similarities are seen in these outﬂows: velocity centroids between 4900 and 5700 km s−1,
distances from the central source (R) of a few hundred parsecs that are all consistent within the er-
rors, and an ˙EK within a factor of two for all outﬂows. Hence, a common origin for the outﬂows is
probable. Most of the outﬂowing mass resides in a very high-ionization phase evident by troughs from
Ne viii, Na ix, Mg x, and Si xii, which connect the physical conditions of these ultraviolet outﬂows
to the X-ray warm absorber outﬂows seen in nearby Seyfert galaxies. Three of the outﬂows have two
or three independent diagnostics for the electron number density, yielding consistent values for each
outﬂow, which increase the robustness of the R determinations. Troughs from never-before-seen ionic
transitions of Ar vi, O iv*, Ne vi*, and Ne v* are identiﬁed. With a combined ˙EK that is 7.0+6.5
−2.3% of
the quasar’s Eddington luminosity, these outﬂows are prime candidates to be major agents for various
active galactic nuclei feedback eﬀects.

1. INTRODUCTION

Blueshifted absorption troughs in the rest frame of
quasar spectra are used to identify outﬂowing mate-
rial from the host galaxy. A large fraction (up to 40%;
Hewett & Foltz 2003; Dai et al. 2008; Ganguly & Broth-
erton 2008; Knigge et al. 2008) of the quasar population
shows absorption outﬂows. Many feedback processes
seen in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are likely caused
by these outﬂows (see elaboration in section 1 of Arav
et al. (2020a), hereafter Paper I, and references therein).
The potential for these outﬂow systems to produce the
aforementioned feedback rests primarily on their kinetic
luminosity ( ˙EK), of which is linearly dependent on the
distance from the central source (R). Simultaneously
determining the electron number density (ne) and ion-
ization parameter (UH) of the outﬂow is the most robust
way to infer these distances (see section 7.1 of Arav et al.
2018). Our group and others have used this method to
publish around 20 such distances (see section 1 of Paper
I and references therein). The range for these distances
is between parsecs to tens of kiloparsecs and is orders of

magnitude larger than theoretical predictions (accretion
disk wind models predict ∼0.03 pc; e.g., Murray et al.
1995; Proga et al. 2000; Proga & Kallman 2004).

The ratio of the kinetic luminosity with respect to the
Eddington luminosity is used to judge the feedback po-
tential. Ratios exceeding 0.5% (Hopkins & Elvis 2010)
or 5% (Scannapieco & Oh 2004) are thought to be suf-
ﬁcient. There are six known outﬂow systems that meet
at least one of these criteria (Moe et al. 2009; Arav et
al. 2013; Borguet et al. 2013; Chamberlain & Arav 2015;
Xu et al. 2019).

The observations analyzed here were taken during Cy-
cle 24 (GO-14777, PI: N. Arav) as part of a spectro-
scopic survey of 10 quasars with known outﬂows and
redshifts around 1. The goal was to probe the 500-
1050 ˚A rest frame wavelength range (EUV500) for nu-
merous diagnostic troughs like those listed in Arav et al.
(2013) that can yield ne and also troughs that arise from
very high-ionization potential ions (e.g. Ne viii, Mg x,
and Si xii) that are typically seen in X-ray warm ab-
sorbers (e.g., Reynolds 1997; Kaastra et al. 2000; Cren-
shaw et al. 2003; Kaastra et al. 2014). With these very
high-ionization potential ions, a connection can be es-
tablished between X-ray warm absorbers and ultraviolet
(UV) AGN outﬂows (Arav et al. 2013).

Miller et al.

GO-14777.
Paper I summarizes the results for the individual ob-
jects and discusses their importance to various aspects
of quasar outﬂow research.
Paper II (Xu et al. 2020a) gives the full analysis for four
outﬂows detected in SDSS J1042+1646, including the
largest kinetic luminosity (1047 erg s−1) outﬂow mea-
sured to date at R = 800 pc and another outﬂow at
R = 15 pc.
Paper III is this work.
Paper IV (Xu et al. 2020b) presents the largest velocity
shift and acceleration measured to date in a broad ab-
sorption line (BAL) outﬂow.
Paper V (Miller et al. 2020b) analyzes two outﬂows
detected in PKS J0352-0711, including one outﬂow at
R = 500 pc and a second outﬂow at R = 10 pc that
shows an ionization potential-dependent velocity shift
for troughs from diﬀerent ions.
Paper VI (Xu et al. 2020c) analyzes two outﬂows de-
tected in SDSS J0755+2306,
including one at R =
1600 pc with ˙Ek = 1046 − 1047 erg s−1.
Paper VII (Miller et al. 2020c, in preparation) discusses
the other objects observed by program GO-14777, whose
outﬂow characteristics make the analysis more challeng-
ing.

The structure of this paper is as follows.

Sec-
tion 2 describes the new observations of 2MASS
J10512569+1247462 (hereafter, 2MASS J1051+1247)
taken by the HST /Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS;
Green et al. 2012). The spectral ﬁtting for the unab-
sorbed continuum and emission lines is also discussed.
Determinations of the ionic column densities and elec-
tron number densities as well as the photoionization
modeling are in Section 3.
Section 4 presents our
results on the physical properties, distances, and en-
ergetics of each outﬂow followed by a discussion in
Section 5. Section 6 closes with a summary and con-
clusions. Throughout this paper, we adopt a cosmology
of h = 0.696, Ωm = 0.286, and ΩΛ = 0.714 and use

2. OBSERVATIONS, DATA REDUCTION, AND

SPECTRAL FITTING

2MASS J1051+1247 (J2000: R.A. = 10:51:25.69,
decl. = +12:47:46.2, z = 1.2828) was ﬁrst observed
by HST /COS in 2013 May (PID 12603) and again in
2018 January (PID 14777). Table 1 contains the details
of each observation. Both datasets were processed in
the same way as described in Miller et al. (2018) and
were corrected for Galactic extinction with E (B-V ) =
0.0202 (Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011). Figure 1 shows
the dereddened, one-dimensional spectra in black and
purple with errors in gray and light red for the 2013
and 2018 epochs, respectively. Absorption troughs for
the four outﬂow systems are delineated S1, S2, S3, and
S4 with centroid velocities and widths summarized in

Table 2. All four outﬂows contain at least one previ-
ously undetected absorption trough: Ar vi 544.73 ˚A and
548.90 ˚A, O IV* 555.26 ˚A, Ne vi* 562.80 ˚A, and Ne v*
569.83 ˚A and 572.34 ˚A. Intervening hydrogen absorp-
tion systems are marked with slanted, dark green lines.
The labels B1–B10 are the following blended troughs:
B1 = O iv 553 S2, O iv 553 S3, and O iv 554 S4; B2
= O iv 553 S1, O iv 554 S3, and O iv* 554.5 S4; B3
= O iv 554 S2 and O iv* 554.5 S3; B4 = O iv 554 S1,
O iv* 554.5 S2, and O iv* 555 S4; B5 = O iv* 554.5
S1 and O iv* 555 S3; B6 = Ne v 568 S1 and Ne v* 570
S4; B7 = O iv 608 S1, Mg x 610 S4, and O iv* 610 S4;
B8 = Mg x 610 S3 and O iv* 610 S3; B9 = Mg x 610
S2 and O iv* 610 S2; B10 = Mg x 610 S1 and O iv*
610 S1.

Following the methodology of Miller et al. (2018), the
continuum emission was ﬁtted with a power law, and line
emission features were modeled with Gaussian proﬁles.
The Gaussian ﬁts were constrained by the red side of
each line, avoiding the absorption that occurs mostly on
the blue side of any given emission line. The Gaussian
centroids were ﬁxed at the rest frame wavelength of each
emission line. The solid red contour in Figure 1 shows
the unabsorbed emission model adopted in this work for
the 2013 epoch up to 645 ˚A (rest frame) and the 2018
epoch at larger wavelengths.

= –5350 km s−1, S4 = –5650 km s−1). Identiﬁcations for transitions yielding upper limits are excluded, except for Ar vi* 597 of S1 (see
section 3.1). Blue shaded regions mark transitions from resonance absorption lines, and red regions mark excited ones. Blended troughs
(B1–B10) are also labeled (see Section 2). Absorption troughs from intervening systems are the slanted dark green shaded regions, and the
vertical dashed lines mark Galactic absorption and geocoronal emission features. The red contour traces the unabsorbed emission model
for the 2013 data up to 645 ˚A (rest frame) and the 2018 data at larger wavelengths.

were used to measure ionic column densities (Nion). The
AOD method uses one ionic transition, while the PC
method uses two ionic transitions to determine a sin-
gle Nion for each ionic energy state. The PC method is
applicable when multiple lines (with diﬀerent oscillator
strengths, f ) from the same ionic energy state have dif-
ferent trough depths, yielding a viable partial covering
solution. Upon visual inspection, the troughs within the
normalized spectra from each epoch did not show signif-
icant variability. Therefore, we used the column density
measurements from the 2013 epoch when possible since
the signal to noise is larger.

The sum of all ionic energy state Nion yields the total
column density of each ion as listed in Table 3 for all out-
ﬂows. Upper and lower limits are highlighted in red and
blue, respectively. S1 has an upper and lower limit Nion
for Ar vi. The total Nion for Ar vi is the sum of the
column densities for the resonance and excited states.
The lower limit is obtained from the Ar vi 548.90 and
544.73 ˚A resonance troughs using the PC method with-
out the addition of the excited state Nion. The Ar vi*
551.36 ˚A trough is contaminated with unidentiﬁed ab-
sorption, so only an upper limit for Ar vi* can be ob-
tained from the Ar vi* 596.67 ˚A region (85+30×1012
cm−2), yielding an overall upper limit to the total Nion
for Ar vi as listed in the table. The last column contains
the ratio of the adopted column densities to the best-ﬁt,
model predicted column densities (see Section 3.2 and
Figure 2). This ratio is expected to be less than one
for measured Nion lower limits and vice versa for upper
limits. The trough labels in Figure 1 combine multiple
transitions with wavelength separations less than 0.5 ˚A
into a single transition. Table 3 of Paper II provides a
list of transition atomic data.

Using the same criteria of Paper II to account for non-
black saturation, all PC determined Nion are treated
as measurements, Nion measured for regions where no
trough is identiﬁed (maximum optical depth, τmax, less
than 0.05) are upper limits, and Nion from troughs where
both 0.05 < τmax < 0.5 and troughs from ions of similar
ionization potential that have τmax > 2 are also treated
as measurements. Our adopted values are the PC values
when available and AOD values otherwise. A systematic
error, 20% of the adopted value, is added in quadrature
with the corresponding AOD/PC errors, yielding the
adopted error values (see Table 3). This systematic error
accounts for uncertainties in the unabsorbed emission
model (e.g., Miller et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018). For
example, N IV of S1 has an AOD Nion = 310+70
−40. Since
we are treating the adopted value as a lower limit, we
calculate the lower error as (cid:112)(40)2 + (0.2 ∗ 310)2 ≈ 70.

3.2. Photoionization Modeling

Since the troughs in each outﬂow are narrow and the
blended troughs are not critical to the analysis, we do
not use the Synthetic Spectral Simulation (SSS) method
presented in Paper II and instead follow the methodol-
ogy of prior works (e.g., Miller et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018,
2019). Each outﬂow system is modeled with a hydro-

gen column density (NH) and UH. We generated grids
of photoionization models with the code Cloudy (Fer-
land et al. 2017, version c17.00). Each grid assumed one
metallicity (two total) and one spectral energy distribu-
tion (SED, three total). The three SEDs are the UV-soft
SED (Dunn et al. 2010), the HE0238 SED (Arav et al.
2013), and the MF87 SED (Mathews & Ferland 1987)
of which are a representative range of SED shapes that
are applicable for radio-quiet quasars (Arav et al. 2013).
The two metallicities are solar, Z(cid:12), from Grevesse et
al. (2010) and super-solar, Z = 4.68Z(cid:12), from Paper V.
These parameters directly determine the model Nion.

To determine the best pair of NH and UH, the mea-
sured Nion are compared to the modeled values. The
colored contours for individual ions in Figure 2 show the
NH and UH pairs where the model Nion are within 1σ of
the observed values, assuming the HE0238 SED and the
solar metallicity. Solid contours represent Nion measure-
ments while dotted and dashed lines indicate upper and
lower limits, respectively. χ2-minimization of the model
Nion compared to the measured Nion from Table 3 deter-
mines the best-ﬁt solution. The adopted, best-ﬁt solu-
tion is the HE0238 SED with the solar metallicity (solid
black dots and 1σ error ellipses). Assuming the solar
metallicity and changing the SED results in the solid
red (UV-soft SED) and solid green (MF87 SED) solu-
tions. As expected, the Nion contours shift according
to the SED shape. For example, the UV-soft SED has
a higher luminosity at the wavelengths needed to pro-
duce the high- and very high-ionization potential ions,
resulting in a lower-ionization parameter in both phases.
Similarly, assuming the super-solar metallicity decreases
the hydrogen column density required to match the ob-
servations, and the associated solutions for each SED
are the plus symbols with dashed ellipses.

A two-phase photoionization solution (Arav et al.
2013) is needed for all outﬂow systems to satisfy the
column density measurements from both the very high-
ionization potential ions (e.g., Mg x, Na ix, and Al xi)
and high-ionization potential ions (e.g., Ne iv, Ne v,
and O iv). For S1, a single phase solution at the inter-
section of the Ne iv and Na ix contours over predicts
the upper limit column densities of Ca vi, Ca viii, and
Ar viii by over an order of magnitude. Similar over
predictions occur for the other outﬂow systems when a
single phase solution is chosen. The values for all NH
and UH determinations are given in Table 4.

3.3. Electron Number Density Determination

The excited state troughs shown in Figure 1 all be-
come populated through electron collisions. The fre-
quency of collisions and amount of energy transferred
between bound and free electrons depend on ne and
the electron temperature. Therefore, ne can be calcu-
lated from the relative populations between either two
diﬀerent excited states or an excited state and a reso-
nance state from the same ion (e.g., de Kool et al. 2001;

HST /COS Observations of Outflows in 2MASS J1051+1247

Figure 2. Two-phase photoionization solution for each outﬂow system. The colored contours show the model parameters that are
consistent with the observed values assuming the HE0238 SED and solar metallicity. Solid contours represent ionic column densities taken
as measurements, while dotted and dashed contours are upper and lower limits, respectively. The shaded bands are the 1σ uncertainties
for each contour (see Table 3). The dots are the best χ2-minimization solutions, assuming the solar metallicity for each ionization phase
and the ellipses encircling them are their 1σ uncertainties. The black, red, and green solutions are for the HE0238 SED, MF87 SED, and
UV-soft SED, respectively. The plus symbol solutions for each phase assume Z = 4.68 Z(cid:12) from Table 3 of Paper V and also account for
the same uncertainty in metallicity.

Hamann et al. 2001; de Kool et al. 2002; Korista et al.
2008). We used the CHIANTI 8.0.7 database (Dere et al.
1997; Landi et al. 2013) to calculate the necessary popu-
lation ratios (equal to the column density ratios) as was
done in previous works (e.g., Borguet et al. 2012b; Arav
et al. 2013, 2015, 2018; Chamberlain & Arav 2015).

However, some of the observed excited states cannot
be used with this method. For each outﬂow system, the
O iv* 790.20 ˚A and 555.26 ˚A troughs (diﬀerent f · λ)
exhibit 1:1 trough depths (indicative of non-black satu-
ration) with not only each other but also with the reso-
nance transitions, making column density measurements
lower limits for every trough. Therefore, the ratios are
unconstrained.

This leaves the Ne vi* 562.81 ˚A and Ne v* 569.83 ˚A
and 572.34 ˚A excited troughs with the Ne vi 558.60 ˚A

and Ne v 568.42 ˚A resonance troughs as potentially use-
ful density diagnostics. Since Ne vi 558.60 ˚A and Ne v
568.42 ˚A are the only resonance transitions for each ion
and, therefore, yield lower limit measurements, we use
the photoionization solutions to constrain the total col-
umn densities for these ions. Nearly all of the Ne v col-
umn density in each outﬂow is produced by their respec-
tive high-ionization phases. Therefore, an upper limit to
the Nion for Ne v is determined by ﬁnding the largest
Nion value contained within the 1σ error ellipse of each
high-ionization phase. When the photoionization solu-
tion yielded a model Nion for Ne v larger than the mea-
sured lower limit value, as is the case for S1, we chose
the model Nion for the ratio calculation. The lower limit
Nion for Ne v was taken to be the measured lower limit

value since it provided a tighter constraint compared to
the smallest value obtained from the 1σ error ellipse.

The same process was done for calculating the Nion
and errors for Ne vi in S3. The Ne vi column densities
for the other outﬂows are produced in roughly equal
amounts from both phases. Assuming the phases are
cospatial given the velocity correspondence, they have
diﬀerent ne values. Therefore, the density cannot be
reliably determined from those Ne vi troughs since we
would have to deconvolve the troughs into the separate
phases. The excited state troughs are all shallower than
their resonance counterparts. Therefore, assuming they
have the same velocity-dependent covering factors, C(v),
and using the maximum values, Cmax(v) = 1-Ires(v)
where Ires(v) is the velocity-dependent normalized ﬂux
for the resonance trough, the measurements of the ex-
cited state column densities are within 30% of their true
values, yielding usable density ratios.

In Figure 3, the theoretical column density ratios as a
function of ne are shown with the black contours for each
population ratio: dotted = N(Ne v* 569.83 ˚A)/N(Ne v
568.42 ˚A) = N(Ne v 413 cm−1)/N(Ne v 0 cm−1),
solid = N(Ne v* 572.34 ˚A)/N(Ne v 568.42 ˚A) =
N(Ne v 1111 cm−1)/N(Ne v 0 cm−1), and dashed =
N(Ne vi* 562.81 ˚A)/N(Ne vi 558.60 ˚A) = N(Ne vi
1307 cm−1)/N(Ne vi 0 cm−1). The measured column
density ratios with uncertainties for each outﬂow sys-
tem are overlaid. The diﬀerent ratios yield consistent ne
within the measurement errors for each outﬂow system.
Therefore, we adopt the N(Ne v 1111 cm−1)/N(Ne v
0 cm−1) ne values for the high-ionization phases since
the Ne v* 572.34 ˚A troughs were the shallowest for each
outﬂow system, yielding the most accurate Nion deter-
minations. The errors for ne are determined by the hor-
izontal intersection of the ratio including the errors with
the CHIANTI curve, e.g., the ne value where the CHI-
ANTI curve gives the ratio adding the plus error yields
the upper error bound on ne. The ne for the very high-
ionization phases (VHP) are calculated by assuming the
two phases are cospatial, and both ne values are listed
in Table 4.

4. RESULTS

Figure 3. Electron number density, ne, of each outﬂow system
based on three population ratios of Ne. The theoretical predictions
from CHIANTI for the population ratios with excited energy levels
of Ne v* 413 cm−1, Ne v* 1111 cm−1, and Ne vi* 1307 cm−1 are
overlaid. The curves assume the average temperature, 27,500 K,
from the photoionization solution for the high-ionization phase of
the –5350 km s−1 outﬂow. The corresponding distance, R (from
equation 1), for this outﬂow is also shown on the top axis. The
oﬀset of the ratios from the shown curves for the other outﬂows
are the result of diﬀerent electron temperatures given by Cloudy
for those outﬂow systems.

The distances of the outﬂows are given in Table 4,
and they are consistent with being located at the same
distance within the errors. The small separations in ve-
locity between each outﬂow also suggests that they are
connected. The full width of the Ne viii trough across
all outﬂows is ∼1200 km s−1. Using the classiﬁcation
scheme in section 4.5 of Paper I, the outﬂows as a whole
are a mini-BAL.

Assuming a partially ﬁlled thin shell outﬂow (see sec-
tion 5.3 here and Borguet et al. 2012), the average
mass ﬂow rate and kinetic luminosity over the dynamical
timescale (R/v) are given by

5. DISCUSSION

5.1. Contribution to AGN Feedback

To assess the potential for AGN feedback, Hopkins
& Elvis (2010) and Scannapieco & Oh (2004) require
kinetic luminosities exceeding 0.5% or 5% of the Ed-
dington luminosity, respectively. Using the Mg ii–
based black hole mass equation from Bahk et al. (2019)
and their methodology to measure the Mg II FWHM
and nearby continuum level from Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) data, the mass of the super massive
black hole is 1.0+0.9
−0.5 × 109M(cid:12) (including systematics)
with the corresponding Eddington luminosity (Ledd) of
1.3+1.1
−0.6 × 1047 erg s−1. Each outﬂow has a kinetic lu-
minosity exceeding the requirement of Hopkins & Elvis
(2010) with values above 1.0% of Ledd. Collectively, the
outﬂows have a kinetic luminosity of 8.8 × 1045 erg s−1,
which is 7.0+6.5
−2.3% of Ledd. Therefore, these outﬂows, on
average, carry enough energy to contribute substantially
to AGN feedback in galaxies with similar black hole
masses as in quasar 2MASS J1051+1247. For example,
recent theoretical modeling has shown that BAL out-
ﬂows eﬀectively quench star formation within the host
galaxy (e.g., Choi et al. 2018, eﬀective radii up to 10
kpc) and drive gas into the intergalactic medium (e.g.,
Brennan et al. 2018).

5.2. Photoionization Solution and ne Accuracy
As seen in Figure 2, the photoionization solutions for
both phases in S1 and S4, as well as the high phases

(HPs) in S2 and S3, are constrained only by Nion up-
per and lower limits, which are immune to saturation
eﬀects. The multitude of upper and lower limits tightly
constrain the errors in the solutions. The photoioniza-
tion solutions of the HPs determined the upper limits
(and sometimes values) of the resonance state Nion for
Ne v and Ne vi used to calculate the population ratios
that yielded ne for each outﬂow (see section 3.3). When
multiple diagnostics were available for a given outﬂow,
the ne values were all consistent within errors. This con-
sistency in ne between multiple diagnostics along with
the tightly constrained photoionization solutions shows
the results are robust and accurate (for more discussions
on these issues, see Paper I).

5.3. Geometry and Volume Filling Factor

There are striking similarities in the geometry between
outﬂows. We assume the VHP occupies the space where
the outﬂow resides (Arav et al. 2013). Therefore, the
VHPs of S1 and S3 have the same thickness (NH/ne)
of 0.62 pc. Similarly, S2 and S4 have a thickness of
2.0 pc for their VHP. All outﬂows have thicknesses less
than 0.6% of their calculated distances. The similarities
continue when looking at the volume ﬁlling factor of the
HP in each outﬂow (the VHP volume ﬁlling factor = 1
given our assumption). Due to the kinematic similarities
of the troughs from the VHP and HP for each outﬂow, it
is physically plausible that the two phases are occupying
the same volume. Since the HP is both denser and has
a lower NH than that of the VHP, the HP has to have a

10

Miller et al.

small volume ﬁlling factor within the VHP. This volume
ﬁlling factor is given by equation 6 in Paper II (see also
Section 2.5 in Paper I):

fV =

UH,HP
UH,VHP

×

NH,HP
NH,VHP

(4)

S1 and S3 have fV values diﬀering by 25% without con-
sidering errors, and S2 and S4 have the same fV value
(see Table 4). Considering the errors, all four outﬂows
have consistent fV values. These similarities in geome-
try, the consistent distances, and small velocity separa-
tions suggest the outﬂows have a common origin.

5.4. Connection to X-Ray Warm Absorbers

The two-phase solutions required for each outﬂow to
suﬃciently reproduce the observed Nion from the high-
and very high-ionization potential ions are similar to
what is seen for X-ray warm absorbers. The ionization
parameter of X-ray warm absorbers can span up to ﬁve
orders of magnitude (-1 < log(ξ) <4) and necessitate
a continuous hydrogen column density as a function of
ξ (e.g., Steenbrugge et al. 2003; Costantini et al. 2007;
Holczer et al. 2007; McKernan et al. 2007; Behar 2009).
The current data allows for higher-ionization phases to
exist within the outﬂows. For the HE0238 SED, log(ξ)
(cid:117) log(UH)+1.3, and, therefore, the photoionization so-
lutions are comparable to what is determined for X-ray
warm absorbers.

5.5. The “Shading Eﬀect”

Even though the four outﬂow systems may reside at
similar distances, the SED seen by an exterior outﬂow
will be attenuated by an interior one (e.g., Bautista et
al. 2010; Sun et al. 2017; Miller et al. 2018). To test the
eﬀects this may have on the results, we used the same
approach as Miller et al. (2018) and assumed that S3
shades the other outﬂows since it has the smallest calcu-
lated distance and the largest total column density. New
Cloudy model grids were generated using the transmit-
ted SEDs from both the high and very high photoion-
ization solutions for S3. New photoionization solutions,
distances, and energetics were determined for the other
outﬂows (see elaboration in Paper V). The end result
was that the distance and energetics decreased by less
than 15%, which is small compared to the overall errors.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper presented new HST /COS spectra for the
quasar 2MASS J1051+1247, which contains four out-
ﬂow systems. For the ﬁrst time, we identiﬁed absorption
troughs from transitions of Ar vi 544.73 ˚A and 548.90 ˚A,
O IV* 555.26 ˚A, Ne vi* 562.80 ˚A, and Ne v* 569.80 ˚A

and 572.30 ˚A. The absorption troughs yielded ionic col-
umn density measurements/lower limits for up to 11 ions
in each outﬂow system. Best-ﬁt photoionization solu-
tions (UH and NH) were determined for each outﬂow by
using a grid of photoionization models in conjunction
with the ionic column density constraints.

Column density ratios between two excited states and
the ground state of Ne v as well as one excited state
and ground state of Ne vi yielded consistent ne for the
outﬂows with multiple determinations (see Figure 3).
These electron number densities were used in equation
(1) to calculate the distance to the central source of each
outﬂow. The mass ﬂux and kinetic luminosity of each
outﬂow were determined from the distance and equa-
tions (2) & (3). Finally, AGN feedback was assessed,
and all of these results are shown in Table 4.

The following emerges from this work:

1. The never-before-seen ionic transitions from Ar vi,
O iv*, Ne vi*, and Ne v* were revealed by the
EUV500 HST /COS observations. The Ne vi* and
Ne v* identiﬁcations enabled the electron number
density, distance, and energetics of all outﬂows to
be determined.

2. A two-phase ionization solution is needed in each
outﬂow to simultaneously satisfy the column den-
sity measurements from ions with a wide range of
ionization potentials (80–520 eV).

3. The small velocity separations, consistent dis-
tances within the errors, and other geometric sim-
ilarities suggest the outﬂows originate from the
same material at the same distance.

4. The outﬂows individually (depending on the theo-
retical work) and collectively have a large enough
kinetic luminosity to Eddington luminosity ratio
to be major contributors to AGN feedback pro-
cesses.
