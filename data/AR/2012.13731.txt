We have found that the error-signal frequency corresponding to the coherent population trapping
resonance can be displaced from that of “0 − 0” transition unperturbed by the optical ﬁeld, although
the frequency is not sensitive to changes in its intensity. We consider the double Λ-system of levels
interacting with the asymmetric polychromatic optical ﬁeld to demonstrate that this eﬀect arises
due to intensity nonlinearity of the error-signal frequency shift. The experiment with 87Rb atoms in
Ar-N2 buﬀer gas atomic cell shows how the displacement value depends on diﬀerent parameters. The
possible inﬂuence of the eﬀect on the clocks’ frequency stability and reproducibility are discussed.

(CPT)
clocks [1–3] are rapidly developed devices since they pro-
vide a possibility to achieve higher long-term frequency
stability compared with quartz oscillators alongside
with drastic reduction of the microwave standards
size [4]. The negative concomitant eﬀect of the all-
optical pumping and interrogation scheme utilizing the
leading to
CPT phenomenon is the light shift [5–11],
a frequency drift of the local oscillator (LO) (if the
optical ﬁeld intensity changes), which limits the long-
term frequency stability [12–16]. One of the standard
approaches of the CPT resonances excitation is the
usage of a polychromatic ﬁeld obtained by modulation
of the injection current of the vertical-cavity surface-
emitting laser (VCSEL) [17, 18]. In many papers it was
demonstrated that in the case of such ﬁelds one can get
rid of the light shift by a proper choice of the depth of
the laser injection current modulation or by a proper
choice of the phase modulation index, if, for example,
the electro-optic modulator is used [19–27]. This is
simply because the higher-order spectrum components
induce the non-resonant light shift of the opposite sign
than the carrier and resonant (ﬁrst-order) sidebands.
Consequently the compensation of partial light shifts
is possible (it refers to the case where the modulation
frequency is equal to the half of the frequency of an
alkali metal atom ground-state hyperﬁne interval).

It was supposed in quite a number of the cited above
works, that for diﬀerent spectra of an optical ﬁeld pro-
viding the zero light shift, the CPT resonance frequency

∗ selentinthebright@gmail.com

is the same. Namely, the two-photon detuning in such
a case is equal to zero, i.e., the resonance frequency is
equal to that of the “0-0” transition unperturbed by op-
tical ﬁelds. However, in our recent study of the buﬀer
gas eﬀect on the light shift suppression possibility, we
obtain the other result [28]. The experiment was per-
formed with the modulated VCSEL and 87Rb atoms, and
the CPT resonance frequency was tracked employing the
technique of the modulation spectroscopy. We have ob-
served vanishing of the frequency sensitivity to variations
of the total laser intensity for two modulation depths (i.e.,
for two diﬀerent spectra). Frequencies of the error-signal
zero-crossing point were diﬀerent in the case of insensi-
tivity.

In this work we demonstrate that this diﬀerence can
occur at high values of the modulation frequency (which
provides the error signal) in the case of unequal powers
of the resonant spectrum components and also due to the
optically thick medium. In these cases, the error-signal
frequency shift becomes a nonlinear function of the laser
power, which gives two diﬀerent conditions for spectra
providing the insensitivity and suppression of the light
shift. We will refer to these cases as the insensitivity
point (IP) and the point of the zero displacement (PZD),
respectively. To demonstrate the divergence analytically,
we consider the optical ﬁeld with unequal resonant side-
bands and phenomenologically take into account their
absorption over the length of an atomic cell. The density
matrix approach is used to obtain analytical expressions
for the spectra providing IP and PZD. The experiment
for the atomic cell with 87Rb atoms and Ar-N2 buﬀer
gas mixture demonstrates how the nonlinearity aﬀects
the error-signal frequency and the way to reduce this in-
ﬂuence.

A couple of coherent optical ﬁelds tuned to atomic
transitions with a common excited state is required for
excitation of a CPT resonance [29–32]. Considering
CPT-based atomic clocks, these transitions are between
states nS1/2 and nP1/2 of an alkali metal atom, since
excitation of a CPT resonance via D1 line provides a
higher contrast compared with that via D2 line [33–35].
In compact atomic clocks modulation of the VCSEL in-
jection current with the frequency Ω is used to obtain a
polychromatic optical ﬁeld for the resonance excitation in
a standard scheme with σ polarization [15]. The modu-
lation frequency is nearly equal to the half of the ground-
state hyperﬁne splitting ωg/2, hence for the two-photon
detuning 2δ = 2Ω
ωg holds. The

CPT resonance is excited by the resonant optical ﬁeld
components with frequencies ωL + Ω and ωL −
Ω, where
ωL is the carrier frequency tuned to the level F = I + 1/2
of the excited state nP1/2. This provides a higher CPT
resonance contrast due to a less optical pumping of the
sublevel nS1/2

with the case of coupling via the excited state level F =

and

If
buﬀer gas is used to decrease the ground-state re-
laxation rate and (or) to prevent the radiation trap-
ping [3, 15, 37, 38], then the optical lines are broadened
due to collisions of alkali metal atoms with buﬀer gas
components [39–41]. When the broadening makes tran-
sitions to F = I + 1/2 and F = I
1/2 levels unresolved,
the resonant components are tuned to the maximum of
the overall absorption contour. We investigate the case
when the absorption lines can overlap, therefore ωL is
consider as nearly equal to the half-sum of the D1 line
transitions to the excited-state level F = I +1/2, ω0. The
ω0,
carrier frequency detuning is deﬁned as ∆L = ωL −
which can diﬀer from zero due to an optical ﬁeld fre-
quency pulling, but by the value much smaller than the
excited-state hyperﬁne frequency splitting, making the

However, a typical VCSEL spectrum under injection cur-
rent modulation diﬀers from the spectrum of the phase-
modulated ﬁeld: while the frequency spacing between
spectrum components k + 1 and k is equal to Ω, the am-
plitudes of its spectral components can not be considered
as given by the Bessel functions [43–45]. Moreover, the
VCSEL spectra are asymmetric, i.e., powers of compo-
nents
are unequal in the vast majority of
cases. On the other hand, amplitudes of the VCSEL
spectral components resemble the behavior of dumped
oscillations. With the increase of the current modula-
tion depth each of them reaches the ﬁrst maximum, then
passes through a local minimum and after that reaches a
new maximum, and so on. Such behavior can provide at
least two spectra for which IP can be observed [28]. The
most signiﬁcant factor of the VCSEL spectra asymmetry
is the inequality of the resonant components amplitudes
1), since this imbalance decreases contrast of CPT
(k =
resonance, makes it asymmetric and gives additional con-
tribution to the shift [3, 34, 46].

We consider modulation spectroscopy of the CPT res-
onances [53]. The crucial point of this technique is the
time-harmonic perturbation of the Ω frequency’s phase
with the index a, ϕ(t) = a sin ωmt. This modulation
provides oscillating response at the frequency ωm in the
absorption coeﬃcient of the optical ﬁeld by an atomic
ensemble κ(t). Then the synchronous detection is used
to obtain dispersive-shape response for stabilization of
the LO frequency and tracking of the CPT resonance
frequency. We note that ωm is comparable to the CPT
resonance width, which ensures the fulﬁllment of the in-
ωg, Ω. The typical CPT resonance width
equality ωm ≪
is in the range from a few tenths to several kHz, de-
pending on atomic cell size and intensity of an optical
ﬁeld, while the ground-state hyperﬁne splitting of the al-
kali metal atoms is in the GHz range. Also, to avoid
confusion, we deﬁne the in-phase and quadrature signals
with respect to the modulation of the frequency Ω, not
to modulation of its phase, i.e., amplitudes S and Q of
the in-phase and quadrature signals, read as

Q =

dt κ(t) sin ωmt,

(2b)

respectively, where integration is carried out over a few
periods of the frequency ωm, and κ(t) is the absorption
coeﬃcient. The synchronous detection can be also made
with some phase shift, i.e., when integrands in Eqs. (2a)-
(2b) contain cos (ωmt + α) and sin (ωmt + α), which gives
some combinations of the in-phase and quadrature sig-
nals. These combinations can have a steeper slope that
S or Q slopes and can provide higher feedback level for
stabilization of the LO frequency.

So far as buﬀer gas is used to reduce relaxation rate of
the microwave coherence arising due to collisions of alkali
metal atoms with the atomic cell walls and to quench
their ﬂuorescence [3, 15, 37, 38], the phenomenological
constant Γ is used to describe resulting broadening of
the optical absorption line. The relaxation of the ground-

state elements is assumed to be isotropic: one constant
Γg is used to describe decoherence of the dark state and
relaxation of the ground-state populations to their equi-
librium values 1/2. Operating pressure of buﬀer gas in
atomic cells is several tens of Torr, depending on atomic
cell size [4, 38, 54], therefore we neglect the Doppler
broadening since it is compared to or smaller than the
homogeneous width of the optical line. On the opposite,
we neglect the microwave Doppler eﬀect since it is can-
celed due to the Dicke narrowing [55].
In addition to
the mentioned above assumptions, the strong inequality
(Γ/Ω)2
1 holds at such buﬀer gas pressures.

An important note must be made regarding Eq. (5).
Only contribution of the resonant optical ﬁeld compo-
nents were explicitly accounted for its derivation, which
is correct for (Γ/Ω)2
1. This feature has obvious phys-
ical meaning: while the optical line broadening is much
smaller than the frequency spacing between optical ﬁeld
components, the CPT resonance is induced mainly by the
ﬁrst sidebands of the optical ﬁeld. Although frequencies
of the components k + 1 and k
= 0) satisfy to
the condition of two-photon resonance, they have large
detunings from the optical transition and their explicit
contribution to the CPT resonance can be neglected. If
the last strong inequality does not hold, a contribution
of other pairs of components should be accounted, for
example,

under consideration in this paper, the non-resonant com-
ponents of the optical ﬁeld contribute only to the light
shift, see the Eq. (6c) and the paragraph after it.

The modulation term a sin ωmt is not contained explic-

to the fact that ωm ≪

too “weak” and slow compared to the excited-state re-
laxation processes to directly aﬀect its populations and

Inequality of the resonant components powers and high

By linearizing the solution of Eqs. (7) over ˜δ we obtain
the following expressions for amplitudes of the in-phase
and quadrature signals:

While the resonant light shift is a consequence of the
changed energy of the ground-state levels, the additional
shift δas arises due to asymmetry of the in-phase signal
(it is not an odd function over ˜δ). The term δas leads to
the following features of the in-phase signal zero-crossing

shift which diﬀers from non-resonant and resonant light
shifts. In particular, we have for the frequency shift of
the in-phase response’s zero:

In practice, the necessity to have a higher contrast of
the CPT resonance implies an increase of the atomic cell
temperature. In such a situation absorption of the res-
onant sidebands should be accounted. Two regimes of
the absorption can be distinguished in the model of Λ-
system of levels in the case of neglecting the Doppler
broadening and ∆L = 0, VL = VR = V [57, 58]. At
the ﬁrst one the contrast is low and the resonant side-
bands decay exponentially over the atomic cell length.
It is determined by the condition V
Γg for the light
incident on an atomic cell. In the second one, provided
by the opposite inequality, the contrast is high, and the
ﬁrst sidebands decay linearly. At ﬁrst glance the sec-
ond regime looks attractive to raise the CPT resonance
contrast by the increase of optical ﬁeld intensity. But
in practice, the opposite situation occurs due to the op-
tical pumping of alkali-metal atoms to the end sublevel
nS1/2
, therefore the maxi-
F = I + 1/2; mF = I + 1/2

mal contrast is obtained in the case V
Γg [59]. The
ﬁrst sidebands are also absorbed on the magnetic sub-
levels, for which condition of the two-photon resonance
is not fulﬁlled, i.e., the ﬁrst regime of the absorption
takes place. Therefore the absorption of the resonant
optical ﬁeld components can be accounted phenomeno-

The experimental setup is schematically shown in
Fig. 4. A single-mode 795 nm VCSEL is current-
3.417 GHz by a mi-
modulated at the frequency Ω
crowave synthesizer. The ﬁrst-order sidebands of the
polychromatic spectrum (see the inset in Fig. 2) excite
the CPT resonance in a standard scheme using a circu-
lar polarization [3, 15]. Coarse laser intensity control is
performed by a half-wave plate and a polarizer. A longi-
tudinal magnetic ﬁeld (
0.1 G) produced by a solenoid
is used to resolve the metrological and two magneto-
sensitive resonances. The optical signal is registered by
the photodetector PD1 and is used to stabilize both the
laser and the LO frequencies. The laser frequency is sta-
bilized by a servo-loop controlling the laser temperature.
The LO frequency is stabilized to the zero-crossing point
frequency of the in-phase response. The laser spectrum is
registered by a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer with
a free spectral range of about 35 GHz and the photode-
tector PD2.

The atomic cell of the cylindrical geometry (8 mm in
diameter and 15 mm in length) ﬁlled with isotopically
enriched 87Rb and a mixture of Ar and N2 is used. The
buﬀer gas pressure is 19 Torr and the ratio of the partial
pressures, PAr/PN2, is 1.3. A heater and a servo-loop
maintain the temperature with an accuracy of 0.01 ◦C.
The cell, heater, and solenoid are placed inside a three-
layer magnetic shield isolating the cell from external
magnetic ﬁelds. The laser beam diameter inside the
cell is about 3 mm, the laser radiation power entering
the atomic cell is 62.5 µW. The power broadening is
1.2 kHz and the full width at half maximum of the
∼
CPT resonance is 1.6 kHz (in the 2δ scale) at the RF
power

9 dBm.

We use the following technique to ﬁnd RF modulation
powers at which the VCSEL’s spectrum provides IPs.
The light intensity is harmonically varied by an acousto-
optic modulator while the RF power is slowly increased.

At certain values of the modulation depth (RF power) the
frequency response vanishes, i.e., changes of the in-phase
signal frequency due to the light intensity modulation
are indistinguishable from ﬂuctuations of the frequency
caused by other factors. These values are IPs by deﬁni-
tion.

The following experimental data are obtained by the
mentioned above method. The RF power is scanned from
5 dBm during 3900 s, while the light mod-
−
ulation period is 25 s (depth of the intensity modulation
is 30%). In this case, the servo-loops properly respond to
changes in the RF power and the light intensity, and the
CPT resonance frequency adiabatically follows changes
in the optical ﬁeld intensity and the RF power.

The dependencies obtained for a = 1/2 and diﬀerent
values of ωm at 45 ◦C are shown in Fig. 2; for diﬀerent
temperatures at ωm/2π = 200 Hz are shown in Fig. 3.
As ωm grows, IPs move towards each other in the hor-
izontal direction and down in the vertical direction. As
the absorption rate increases, IPs move to the left in the
horizontal direction and up in the vertical direction. The
frequencies corresponding to the ﬁrst (ωF ) and second
(ωS) IP are presented in Tables I-II. The values of er-
rors were calculated based on the range without distinct
frequency ﬂuctuations.

tions the diﬀerence of ωF,S/2π from frequencies of PZDs

Considering Fig. 3, the absorption of the ﬁrst side-
bands grows from 15% to 35% for the corresponding
temperature growth from 45 to 65 ◦C. At a higher tem-
perature, the ﬁrst sidebands are absorbed to a greater
extent, and the smaller RF power is required to achieve
IPs. The change of IPs frequencies is mostly given by the
temperature-induced shift from the buﬀer gas [? ] (un-
der the experimental conditions the spin-exchange shift
can be neglected [? ]). Thus, the shift of IPs frequencies

Dependence of the error-signal frequency on ωm can
be suppressed by reducing the
value via adjusting the
detuning ∆L. From the steady-state solution of Eqs. (6)
follows that the CPT resonance is symmetrical and the
responses are odd functions of ˜δ in the case
= 0, even
2
1 . As a consequence, the zero-crossing point is
if
not shifted by δas. The equality
= 0 can be fulﬁlled
at a certain value of the one-photon detuning [50], which
we call here the symmetrizing value. For 87Rb atoms it
is determined (in MHz) by the following condition:

IV. DISCUSSION

Ideally, when the total laser intensity, distribution of
optical power between spectral components, parameters
a, ωm, temperature, do not drift, we have the stable
clocks, and divergence between frequencies of IPs and
PZDs is irrelevant. While the modulation parameters
a, ωm, and temperature of the atomic cell can be con-
trolled with good enough levels, the VCSELs undergo
so-called aging and their optical ﬁeld changes. Unfortu-
nately, there are no studies in the literature demonstrat-
ing which parameters change in the ﬁrst place. If the dis-
tribution changes, then the dependence minimum of the
error-signal frequency on the RF power can be chosen as
the working point. If the total power changes, then ei-
ther the ﬁrst IP is used, or the value of ωm is ﬁnely tuned
to move two ﬁrst IPs to the minimum, see the curve for
ωm/2π = 1200 Hz in Fig. 2. If the change in the ratio of
the ﬁrst sidebands powers is more critical, then the laser
frequency can be adjusted [27] to reduce δas value, and,
consequently, the divergence between frequencies of IPs
and PZDs.

We note that the ﬁne-tuning approach requires a ﬁxed
ratio of the ﬁrst sidebands powers. Otherwise, the fre-
quency of the minimum will change with the drift of this
ratio, despite its linear dependencies on total power, and
the RF power are suppressed. Therefore, at least the
clocks frequency reproducibility will be decreased.

V. SUMMARY

−

We have demonstrated that there are two diﬀerent con-
ditions on the laser spectra, providing the insensitivity
to changes in the optical ﬁeld intensity and the zero dis-
placement of the error-signal frequency from that of the
“0
0” transition. The divergence arises due to the in-
equality of the ﬁrst sidebands powers or optically thick
medium, making the frequency shift a nonlinear function
of the laser power. The ﬁrst source of the eﬀect makes
it more diﬃcult to reach the insensitivity compared to
the linear case, i.e., deeper modulation of the VCSEL
injection current is required.
In contrast, the increase
of the ﬁrst sidebands absorption has the opposite eﬀect,
i.e., the insensitivity can be reached at smaller modula-
tion depths. At the same time, both sources result in
a decreased degree of the insensitivity. Namely, the lin-
ear response of the error-signal frequency can be reduced

9

only to a quadratic one. Whereas in the optically thin
medium at equal powers of the ﬁrst sidebands, the sup-
pression both of the displacement and sensitivity can be
total.

We have also shown that the error-signal frequency
shift from inequality of the ﬁrst sidebands powers de-
pends on the laser frequency and decreases when the laser
frequency approaches the so-called symmetrizing value.
This allows us to conclude that locking of the laser fre-
quency to the vicinity of the symmetrizing value (via sta-
bilization to the slope of the absorption contour) can be
useful when the ratio of the resonant sidebands powers
varies with the VCSEL aging. On the other hand, if
the change of the total power is more critical, then the
diﬀerence in the ﬁrst sidebands powers can be used pos-
It allows the ﬁne tuning, i.e., the minimum of
itively.
the error-signal frequency dependence on the RF power
can be made less sensitive to variations in the total laser
power. Also, the pulled value of the one-photon detun-
ing approaches to the symmetrizing one with growth of
the homogeneous broadening of the optical line. Thus,
the usage of atomic cells with relatively high buﬀer gas
pressure can be helpful to reduce the resonance’s asym-

metry. Besides, it increases with the growth of the dif-
ference between populations of magneto-insensitive sub-
levels. Therefore, the reduction of the laser intensity can
be also useful to make the resonance more symmetric.

If one relies on its modulation to seek a spectrum pro-
viding the zero light shift, then it is important to have
the error-signal frequency shift as close as possible to a
linear function of the optical ﬁeld power. In the case of
nonlinearity, the error-signal frequency will be displaced
from that of the ground-state transition unperturbed by
optical ﬁelds. Moreover, the displacement can undergo
drifts (for example, due to a change in the ratio of the ﬁrst
sidebands powers), which will worsen the long-term fre-
quency stability and reproducibility of an atomic clock.
The criterion of the linearity is the coincidence of the
error-signal frequency for diﬀerent spectra providing the
insensitivity to variations in the laser power.
