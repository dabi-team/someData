Refractive optical elements are widely used in millimeter and sub-millimeter astronomical telescopes.
High resistivity silicon is an excellent material for dielectric lenses given its low loss-tangent, high ther-
mal conductivity and high index of refraction. The high index of refraction of silicon causes a large Fres-
nel reÔ¨Çectance at the vacuum-silicon interface (up to 30%), which can be reduced with an anti-reÔ¨Çection
(AR) coating. In this work we report techniques for efÔ¨Åciently AR coating silicon at sub-millimeter wave-
lengths using Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) and bonding the coated silicon to another silicon optic.
Silicon wafers of 100 mm diameter (1 mm thick) were coated and bonded using the Silicon Direct Bond-
ing technique at high temperature (1100 C). No glue is used in this process. Optical tests using a Fourier
Transform Spectrometer (FTS) show sub-percent reÔ¨Çections for a single-layer DRIE AR coating designed
for use at 320 microns on a single wafer. Cryogenic (10 K) measurements of a bonded pair of AR-coated
wafers also reached sub-percent reÔ¨Çections. A prototype two-layer DRIE AR coating to reduce reÔ¨Çections
and increase bandwidth is presented and plans for extending this approach are discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION

Superconducting detector arrays for millimeter and sub-
millimeter astrophysics have become increasingly larger in re-
cent decades (e.g., [1‚Äì3]). This has motivated the need for com-
pact, high throughput optical designs with diffraction limited
performance across the entire array. High resistivity silicon is an
excellent material for cryogenic dielectric lenses, given its low
loss-tangent, high thermal conductivity and high index of refrac-
tion [4]. A crucial technology for optical designs with refractive
silicon optics is an appropriate anti-reÔ¨Çection (AR) coating. This
coating needs to be designed to overcome the ‚àº 30% Fresnel
reÔ¨Çection at each one of the silicon-vacuum interfaces.

An AR layer consists of a layer of a dielectric material that

is added on the substrate to reduce the inherent reÔ¨Çection due
to the mismatch in the indices of refraction between two media.
If the thickness of this dielectric layer is chosen to be Œª
4 in the
dielectric media, reÔ¨Çections will create a destructive interference

maximizing the transmission. For the case of silicon (nSi = 3.4)
and a Œª/4 coating of index of refraction n, it can be shown that
the reÔ¨Çection coefÔ¨Åcient is given by:

R =

(nSi ‚àí n2)2
(nSi + n2)2 ,

which is zero for n2 = nSi [5, 6]. For silicon, a Œª/4 AR coating
gives reÔ¨Çections below 1% over a 25% bandwidth at normal

ing DRIE on a polished silicon wafer. Bottom: Schematic view
of the simulated dielectric metamaterial structure. Fabrication
yields features such as a small radius of curvature (r) on the
corners of the squares. The bottoms of the holes are shaped
with a Ô¨Ånite radius of curvature (R). The depth of the hole (d)
is monitored during the fabrication. The pitch (p) and the side
of the square of the holes (a) are given by the design of the
photolithography mask. Alternative geometries can also be
fabricated, see Section 7 for an example of pillars instead of
holes.

incidence. Reduced reÔ¨Çections and wider bandwidths can be
achieved by the use of multiple coating layers (e.g., [4]). In
practice, in order to make an AR coating, a material with the
right index of refraction must be found or fabricated to mini-
mize reÔ¨Çections. At mid-IR/optical wavelengths, the AR layer
can be applied using a thin Ô¨Ålm deposition, however at far-
IR/millimeter wavelengths the AR layer becomes macroscopic
and difÔ¨Åcult to apply. Plastic coatings have been explored at
millimeter wavelengths [7‚Äì10]. Laser milling and laser ablation
have been proposed to make simulated dielectric metamaterial
AR coatings [11‚Äì13] but custom high-power optical setups are
needed.

Simulated dielectric metamaterial AR coatings consist of sub-
wavelength structures on a substrate. This technique allows
the designer to tune the effective index of refraction of the AR
coating by changing geometric properties of the structure on the
substrate. Because metamaterial AR coatings are built from the
same material as the substrate, they naturally eliminate differen-
tial thermal contraction problems that arise from using materi-
als with different expansion coefÔ¨Åcients over large temperature
ranges.

Simulated dielectric metamaterial AR coatings have been
deployed in Cosmic Microwave Background experiments op-
erating at 90, 150, and 220 GHz [1, 4].
In the case of ACT-
Pol, the metamaterial is fabricated using a silicon dicing saw.
This method is time-consuming and at shorter wavelengths
(‚àº 300 ¬µm) becomes increasingly challenging to implement

ture. Right: Equivalent capacitive circuit [17] used to extract
the effective dielectric constant.

since thinner blades are required. For shorter wavelengths
the use of Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) has been stud-
ied [14, 15]. DRIE is an anisotropic etching technique used in
semiconductor technologies which allows etching of vertical
structures of scales ranging from hundreds of nanometers to
hundreds of microns in size.

Since DRIE is typically applied on a Ô¨Çat silicon wafer, we
explore the Silicon Direct Bonding (also called fusion bonding
[16]) technique, where two polished silicon pieces are bonded
together by using a chemical treatment and high temperature
(1100 C) annealing. Here, the bonding is done via covalent
bonds in the silicon-native oxide interface. No glue is used in
this process.

In this work we report the manufacture of a 100 mm diameter
(500 ¬µm thick) Ô¨Çat wafer coated on both sides with a square grid
structure which achieved reÔ¨Çections lower than 1% at 925 GHz
as measured by a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS). We
also report the fabrication of a sample composed of two wafers
(1 mm thick) that were coated on one side each and were bonded
using the Silicon Direct Bonding technique; this sample was mea-
sured to have less than 1% reÔ¨Çections at cryogenic temperatures.
Finally, we report on a prototype two-layer DRIE AR coating.

2. DESIGN

The single-layer metamaterial design consists of a grid of sub-
wavelength square holes as shown schematically in Figure 1. It
can be shown that the symmetry of such a grid has zero cross
polarization at normal incidence [18]. For a pitch much smaller
than the wavelength, the structure presents an effective dielectric
constant, (cid:101)e f f , to incoming radiation [19].

In the early design stages, an analytic Effective Medium The-
ory [20] approximation is used to determine the effective dielec-
tric constant of the metamaterial structure. In particular, the
capacitive model proposed in [17] is used to model the square
structure depicted in Figure 1 for R = ‚àû and r = 0. Here the
slabs of material in the square structure are treated as the dielec-
tric inside a grid of capacitors as shown in Figure 2. The effective
dielectric constant of the structure is approximated according to

(cid:101)e f f = (cid:101)Si(1 ‚àí a/p) +

(cid:101)Si(cid:101)o a/p
(cid:101)Sia/p + (cid:101)o(1 ‚àí a/p)

sensors and actuators. In general, silicon wafer bonding involves
the following steps [16]:

electromagnetic simulations using CST Microwave Studio [21].
These simulations take into account geometrical features that
appear in practice after the etching is done. Simulations include
the effect of the small radius of curvature (r) on the vertex of
the square hole and the curvature at the bottom of the hole (R).
Simulations also took into consideration the 1.5 ¬µm difference
between pattern sizes in the mask and in the silicon due to the
photolithography and etching. Target feature sizes are summa-
rized in Table 1.

3. FABRICATION METHODS

Two fabrication techniques that are common in the semicon-
ductor industry were used: Deep Reactive Ion Etch (DRIE) and
Silicon Direct Bonding.

A. Deep Reactive Ion Etch

Deep Reactive Ion Etch is a process where the kinetic energy
from a plasma is used to activate a chemical reaction that carries
out the etching. Various chemistries have been proposed, but
the Bosch process is the most common [22]. It requires a mixture
of two gasses. One gas (SF6) enables the etching and a the
second gas (C4F8) deposits to act as a passivation layer to inhibit
sidewall etching. Ion bombardment from the plasma gives the
energy to enable the reaction and privileges the vertical direction
as walls show a small cross section to the incoming ions. When
SF6 is introduced, a very short time is dedicated to remove the
passivation layer from the bottom of the hole, the rest of the time
is used to etch the silicon and the passivation layer deposited on
the walls. In practice, a photoresist (PR) layer is used to create
an etch mask, deÔ¨Åning the pattern to be etched. Figure 3 shows
a schematic diagram of the process. See [23, 24] for reviews.

Fig. 5. IR transmission image of the bonded sample. Imperfec-
tions in the bonding are seen as dark spots. In the lower-center
region of the image a ‚àº 1cm sized bubble is observed. This
region didn‚Äôt achieve complete bonding, probably due to a
dust particle. A one micron sized dust particle can result in a
bubble of several millimeters in size due to the high stiffness
of silicon. The fringes can be used to estimate the bubble thick-
ness, in this case giving an upper limit of ‚àº 4 microns. The
mosaic pattern is caused by the stitching of multiple images in
the measuring apparatus.

B. Silicon Direct Bonding

Silicon wafer bonding is the process where two mirror polished
Ô¨Çat and clean silicon wafers are locally attracted to each other
by van der Waals forces and adhere or bond. Typically a heat
treatment makes the bonding permanent. This technique is used
in areas of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) devices and silicon-based

1. The surfaces, which need to be mirror polished are prepared
for the bonding process. The interface needs to have some
oxide, this can be achieved by thermal oxidation or just a
native oxide layer. The wafer interface needs to be coated
with monolayers of water which are likely to be adsorbed
during the rinse cycles [25].

ished side. Surface roughness was ‚àº 1¬µm. Surface imperfections expand throughout the etching process leaving different features
at the bottom of a trench. This effect is mitigated by using a polished wafer. Right: Histogram of the depths over a 1 square inch
silicon piece. Each histogram represents the depth distribution as extracted from the proÔ¨Ålometer data in a particular region of a
25 mm silicon piece. Solid histogram represents the aggregate of nine measurements done over this square.

2. Polished wafers need to be brought into contact at room
temperature. A clean environment is critical in this step,
as a dust particle of ‚àº 1 ¬µm in size can lead to a bubble at
the bonded interface of ‚àº 1 mm [26]. Portable clean room
setups (not explored in this work) have been proposed to
control this effect [27].

3. After contact, a Ô¨Årst stage of (reversible) bonding takes
place. Room temperature bonding is given by van der
Waals interactions in the silicon interface. A high tempera-
ture bath is needed now to make this bonding permanent.
Commercial applications are typically treated at 1100 C.

A. Deep Reactive Ion Etch

The photolithography mask in use had the same pitch but bigger
hole width (a) than the target geometry to account for edge
effects in the lithography process, since features are expanded
during the etching. The mask had the following geometry: a =
42.8 ¬µm, p = 50.0 ¬µm. A contact aligner was used to expose the
photoresist. After development, etching was performed with
the UNAXIS 770 Deep Silicon Etcher available at the Cornell
NanoScale Facility (CNF) which gave etch rates of ‚àº 0.3 ¬µm per
loop as measured with a Zygo NewView 7300 optical surface
proÔ¨Åler (also at CNF). In Figure 3 a schematic of the process is
shown.

A variety of chemical mechanisms have been proposed to
explain the bonding action at the interface [28]. A simpliÔ¨Åed pic-
ture of the underlying chemistry of the process can be described
with the reaction [16]:

2H2O + Si ‚Üí SiO2 + 2H2

(3)

which occurs at a couple hundred degrees. Higher temperatures
allow re-Ô¨Çow of the oxide layer, which helps to Ô¨Åll in the gaps
between the silicon wafers. In practice, a chemical treatment
is used to remove metal contamination on the wafers and an
IR inspector can be used to monitor bubble formation before
putting the samples in the high temperature furnace. Figure 4
shows a schematic diagram of the process. See [25, 26, 29, 30]
for reviews on silicon wafer bonding.

4. FABRICATION

Samples were etched after being lithographically patterned. The
etching was done using DRIE and an optical proÔ¨Åler was used to
monitor the depth of the holes during the process. One 0.5 mm
thick silicon wafer was used. Both sides were etched. This sam-
ple was used as a control sample to characterize the performance
of the AR structure alone. Two 1 mm thick silicon wafers were
etched only on one side. These two samples were later bonded
and transmission of this composite sample was measured.

cases respectively. Differences in R can be approximated by a
small change in the effective depth.

B. Silicon Direct Bonding

Bonded samples were made on 1 mm thick polished (on one
side) wafers. These samples were bonded after they were AR
coated with the DRIE process. Etching was performed on the
rough side only and bonding was done on the polished sides.

Lower Left: Bonded silicon wafers at room temperature. Lower Right: Transmission measurements from portion of AR coated (and

Both etched wafers were put in an RCA clean [32] chemical
treatment before bonding. This treatment consists of a basic
solution (H2O : NH4OH : H2O2 = 6 : 1 : 1) and an acidic
(H2O : HCl : H2O2 = 6 : 1 : 1) bath. Samples were put in each
bath for 10 minutes. They were centrifuged and dried right after
the bath and put in contact immediately after drying while still
in the clean room.

Inside the furnace we used silica discs to press the wafers
together. A silica cylinder was used to keep the wafers from
sliding while in the furnace. We processed the samples in a high
temperature (1100 C) furnace for two hours in a N2 atmosphere.
Ramp up and down times made the entire furnace process take
‚àº1 day. After bonding, a Schott IR inspector at Œª = 1.2 ¬µm was
used to look for bubbles between the bonded substrates. Figure
5 shows an IR image of the bonded sample.

5. PROCESS CHARACTERIZATION

The geometry of the etched samples was measured with a Zygo
Optical proÔ¨Åler. The etched holes on a polished wafer can be

characterized by a depth d and radius of curvature R. The sharp
corners in the square grid were smoothed out by the lithography
process and can be described by a radius of curvature r (see Fig-
ure 1 (top) for deÔ¨Ånitions). Measured values are shown in Table
1. Unpolished samples show features on the etched holes. Fig-
ure 6 (left) shows a proÔ¨Åle map of one of our measured samples
which was fabricated on an unpolished wafer. Figure 6 (right)
shows a series of histograms of proÔ¨Åle maps taken over 1 square
inch. The etched pattern does not deteriorate with the thermal
process used during bonding or thermal cryogenic cycling.

Occasionally, the bonding process yielded bubbles where
bonding was not possible. Figure 5 shows an IR image where one
bubble was formed. These bubbles are believed to be generated
by dust particles in the clean room and expanded in size due
to the stiffness of silicon. A portable clean room setup can help
improving bonding yield [27].

Parameters (cid:101)AR and (cid:101)Si are the real part of the dielectric constant of the AR layer and the bulk silicon respectively. (cid:101)(cid:48)(cid:48) is the imaginary
part of bulk silicon as deÔ¨Åned in Equation 4. thAR, thSi and thgap are the thicknesses of the AR layer, bulk silicon and the gap where
the bonding did not yield. The bulk silicon dielectric constant was varied in the allowed range in [33] and the other parameters were
left free. Uncertainties from this Ô¨Åt are indicated in the last quoted digit. This approach neglects the metamaterial nature of the
coatings, which leads to systematic uncertainties, such as the effective thickness variations discussed in [4]. The silicon thickness Ô¨Åt in
the Ô¨Åve-layer bubble model is half the thickness in the three-layer model Ô¨Åt resulting in a consistent total thickness.

6. TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS

C. Bonded wafer tests

A Bruker IFS125 Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) was used.
The transmission geometry conÔ¨Åguration was selected to test the
performance of the AR layer and the performance of the bonded
AR treated sample over the frequency range 0.9 to 21 THz. The
FTS employed a 6 micron mylar beamsplitter in conjunction
with a mercury arc lamp and a liquid helium cooled bolometer
detector to span the aforementioned frequency band. Samples
were mounted in an Oxford liquid helium cooled cryostat for
measurements at sample temperatures of 10 K. The single silicon
piece etched on both sides was used to test the transmission
properties of the AR coating alone. The bonded wafers were
tested to study the transmission properties of the entire process
(DRIE AR treatment and high temperature bonding).

A. Properties of silicon

Transmission was modeled using a multiple layer model for
effective media [19, 31]. Here, each layer has a (effective) dielec-
tric constant and a Ô¨Ånite thickness. The dielectric constant (cid:101) is
related to the index of refraction n according to

n2 = (cid:101) = (cid:101)(cid:48) + i(cid:101)(cid:48)(cid:48)

(4)

The transmission line matrix formulation for isotropic layered
media presented in [31] was used to describe the transmission
coefÔ¨Åcient T of a stack of layers. Where T = 1/M11 for normal
incidence and M is the matrix that represents the stack of layers
in this formalism.

In particular, a three layer (AR-Si-AR) model was used. In
this model each layer has a constant dielectric function (cid:101). The
dielectric constant of the bulk silicon is taken from [33] while
the dielectric constant of the AR layer and its thickness are Ô¨Åtted
from the FTS transmission data.

B. Single wafer tests

FTS measurements on the double sided AR treated single sili-
con piece show excellent transmission (better than 99%) both
at room temperature and at cryogenic temperatures (10 K)
which is consistent with the high resistivity specs of this sample
(> 2000 ‚Ñ¶ cm).

The best Ô¨Åt model parameters are shown in Table 2. Figure
7 (upper left) shows the transmission measurements. Transmis-
sion better than 99% is achieved between 840 and 980 GHz. Fit
residuals, have an RMS error of 0.7%.

Cryogenic measurements show a transmission better than 99%
from 876 to 934 GHz. Figure 7 (upper right) shows the best Ô¨Åt
model (Table 2) and the FTS transmission data. High frequency
ripples are an artifact of the measurement and resulted from the
cryogenic window used. RMS error is 1.4% from 600 to 1250
GHz.

Room temperature measurements show a loss of approx-
imately 5% as shown in Figure 7 (lower left). This room-
temperature loss was not expected for the roughly 1000 ‚Ñ¶ cm
resistivity silicon used for these samples and is under investi-
gation. It is clear that the loss becomes negligible (see Figure 7
(upper right)) at cryogenic temperatures (10 K) where similar
optics often operate.

C.1. Effect of gaps between bonded surfaces
Transmission in the sample that shows the largest ‚àº 1 cm bubble
as seen in the IR image (Figure 5) is measured. The transmission
obtained shows a double peak pattern (Figure 7, lower right).
This fringe pattern can be modeled with a 5 layer model (AR-
Si-Air-Si-AR). Our best Ô¨Åt parameters (Table 2) show that this
model is consistent with a 2.7 ¬µm air gap between the wafers.
Fringe counts seen in the IR image suggest an upper bound of
‚àº 4 ¬µm for this thickness, consistent with direct measurements
of the thickness of the stack on this region and with the average
gap size illuminated in the FTS measurements.

7. PROTOTYPE TWO-LAYER COATING

Many silicon optics applications stand to beneÔ¨Åt from wider
bandwidth and reduced reÔ¨Çections than are provided by a single-
layer AR coating. A prototype two-layer coating comprised of
pillars has been developed by scaling the coating design in [4]
for a wavelength of 350 ¬µm (Figure 8).

The prototype two-layer AR coating was fabricated on a sili-
con wafer by using two etch masks to deÔ¨Åne two sets of trenches
of different widths and depths. The Ô¨Årst etch mask was cre-
ated by depositing 500 nm of silicon oxide onto the wafer using
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and etch-
ing it into small squares using Reactive Ion Etching (RIE). These
small squares of oxide deÔ¨Åne the top of the upper pillar. The

processed using DRIE to etch the lower trenches to a depth of
42 ¬µm. The photoresist was removed, exposing the silicon oxide,
and the wafer was etched again until the upper trenches reached
a depth of 62 ¬µm. During this step, the lower trenches were
etched to a depth of 31 ¬µm below the upper trenches. The lower
trench depth was effectively raised by 11 ¬µm due to a mismatch
in etch rates between the two trenches. The oxide etch mask was
removed in an HF bath.

A next step in developing multi-layer coatings like this could
include more precise characterization of the relative etch rates
for the lower and upper trenches to optimize the AR coating
performance. This approach shows signiÔ¨Åcant promise for fabri-
cating broader bandwidth coatings in the future.

8. CONCLUSION

We have developed single-layer silicon AR coatings at sub-
millimeter wavelengths and a prototype two-layer coating using
a DRIE technique on 100 mm diameter silicon wafers. A Silicon
Direct Bonding approach was used to bond the AR coated silicon
to a substrate for use in refractive optical elements. No glue is
used in this process. We have shown that this method does not
introduce additional losses at the percent-level. A few micron
bubble was formed during the bonding process and character-
ized, with suggestions made for eliminating bubble formation
in the future.

Optical elements that could utilize this technique directly
include Fabry-P√©rot cavities, half-wave plates, and the planar
side of plano-convex lenses.

Extensions of this technique include full development of
multi-layer AR coatings for sub-millimeter and millimeter wave-
lengths and implementation on larger diameter wafers. Simi-
lar bonding techniques could also be used to bond AR-coated
wafers to the curved surfaces of lenses [34].
