AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELING OF FOREST DYNAMICS

OLGA RUMYANTSEVA, ANDREY SARANTSEV, NIKOLAY STRIGUL

Abstract. In this work, we employ autoregressive models developed in ﬁnancial engineering
for modeling of forest dynamics. Autoregressive models have some theoretical advantage over
currently employed forest modeling approaches such as Markov chains and individual-based
models, as autoregressive models are both analytically tractable and operate with continuous
state space. We perform time series statistical analysis of forest biomass and basal area recorded
in Quebec provincial forest inventories in 1970–2007. The geometric random walk model ade-
quately describes the yearly average dynamics. For individual patches, we ﬁt an AR(1) process
capable to model negative feedback (mean-reversion). Overall, the best ﬁt also turns out to
be geometric random walk, however, the normality tests for residuals fail. In contrast, yearly
means are adequately described by normal ﬂuctuations, with annual growth, on average, 2.3%,
but with standard deviation of order 40%. We use Bayesian analysis to account for uneven
number of observations per year. This work demonstrates that autoregressive models represent
a valuable tool for modeling of forest dynamics. In particular, they quantify stochastic eﬀects of
environmental disturbances and develop predictive empirical models on short and intermediate
temporal scales.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background. Understanding the dynamics and self-organization of ecosystems is one of
the most challenging problems in modern ecology [19]. Self-organization occurs simultaneously
on several levels of hierarchical ecosystem organization and involves dynamic processes operat-
ing on diﬀerent temporal and spatial scales [21]. Forest dynamics refers to temporal and spatial
changes that occur simultaneously at diﬀerent levels of ecosystem organization. Various model-
ing approaches employed to understand and predict these changes include a number of discrete
and continuous stochastic and deterministic models, such as Markov chains, individual-based
models, ordinary and partial diﬀerential equations [41]. A large number of forest models have
been developed over the last decades [2,31,33,34,37,40]. Still, there are fundamental questions
that existing quantitative approaches fail to fully address. One of the major challenges is the
understanding of forest succession and biomass dynamics under the non-stationary disturbance
regimes related to climatic factors and anthropogenic activities. An incomplete list of distur-
bances that substantially aﬀect tree survival and lead to forest biomass decrease include wind,
frost, hurricanes, harvesting and forest ﬁres. Markov chains are able to capture eﬀects of all
these disturbances on forest biomass dynamics [28]. However, their application is based on
the discretization of the state space [39]. Spatially-explicit individual-based models are able
to simulate eﬀects of disturbances in continuous time and state space [32, 40, 41]. However,
these models are typically analytically intractable, i.e. the model predictions are produced by
computer simulations only, and it limits our ability to understand what model prediction in
general [26, 40].

Another challenge to our understanding of forest dynamics is the multidimensional nature
of this complex adaptive system [21, 27]. Forest disturbances are traditionally associated with
a loss of biomass. However, Markov chain models based only on biomass do not capture
forest succession comprehensively [27, 39]. This limitation motivates the need for alternative

formulations that are able to consider several forest dimensions instead of only one.
previous study, we combined multivariate statistical analysis with Markov chain approach to
develop a multidimensional Markov Chain [27]. However, simultaneous discretization of several
independent forest characteristics of a diﬀerent nature substantially reduced our ability to
understand the ecological meaning of model predictions, which was one of the major advantages
of the Markov Chain approach [5, 28, 34, 39].

1.2. Forests and stock markets. In this work, we employ time series (autoregressive models
and random walk) to quantify disturbance regimes and to build a predictive stochastic model
of multiple disturbance classes. This type of models can overcome both major shortcomings of
previous models outlined above. Autoregressive models operate with continuous space, they are
analytically tractable, and they can operate with multidimensional characteristics of complex
adaptive systems. Similar approaches have been successfully applied, for example, in modeling
stock market ﬂuctuations. We develop a stochastic theory of forest dynamics using an analogy
to stock market theory in ﬁnancial mathematics. A stock market is another complex system
with random ﬂuctuations due to multiple diﬃcult-to-predict factors. Each individual stock
has ﬂuctuations with heavy tails. But the total stock market, measured by an index (such as
Standard & Poor 500) has long-run ﬂuctuations (3–4 years) which follow Gaussian distribution.
These ﬂuctuations depend on various factors, such a price-earnings ratio (this measures whether
the stock market is underpriced or overpriced; one can informally think of this as temperature
of the stock market) and Treasury rates (long-term and short-term). These factors, in turn,
can be modeled as various autoregressive models. Our main idea is to imagine that individual
patches behave like stocks, and an average over a particular region is a stock market index.

1.3. Understanding and modeling of forest patch dynamics. In this work we propose to
employ autoregressive models to understand and predict forest dynamics at the patch level. The
patch-mosaic concept [46] was actively developed in the second half of the twentieth century
after suggestion in [45] that forested ecological systems can be considered a collection of patches
at diﬀerent successional stages. Dynamic equilibrium arises at the level of the patch mosaic
rather than at the level of individual patches. The classic patch-mosaic methodology assumes
that patch dynamics can be represented by changes in macroscopic variables characterizing
the state of the patch as a function of time [20]. Conservation law modeling in the case of
continuous time and patch state results in the reaction-advection-diﬀusion model [20].

Patch dynamics concept can be applied for understanding and predicting of forest dynamics
at diﬀerent levels of forest organisation within the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm [41,
46]. At the level of individual trees patch dynamics concept is traditionally called the forest
gap dynamics [30, 36, 37]. Individual-based forest models capture gap dynamics by simulating
growth, competition and mortality of individual trees [3, 8, 32, 33].
Individual-based models
and analytically-tractable models approximating gap dynamics [18, 40] provide scaling from
individual-level dynamics to the next level of forest hierarchical organisation, the stand-level.
In the present work we apply autoregressive models to the stand-level forest patch dynamics.
At this level of forest organisation we operate with forest patches (forest stands) consisting of
a large number of individual trees [39]. Forest stand is aﬀected not by individual-level tree
dynamics, as well as by large-scale disturbances such as forest ﬁres, drought and hurricanes

AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELING OF FOREST DYNAMICS

[15,30], which aﬀect many trees in the stand at the same time. The stand-level dynamics scales
up to the next hierarchical level of particular forest type or regional patch mosaic (level 3 in
the hierarchical patch mosaic Matreshka model [41]).

The interplay of individual-level and stand-level changes and disturbances creates complex
dynamical patterns at the stand-level. One particular source of complexity is related to a large
number of intermediate level disturbances aﬀecting only a fraction of trees in the patch [39].
As the consequence of this system complexity a classical linear patch dynamics model does
not capture patch dynamics of the US and Canadian forests [23, 28, 39]. This classical patch-
dynamics model can be represented in continuous case by advection-reaction patch-dynamics
conservation law model [20], and in discrete case by birth and death process that can be
written as a Markov Chain [41], or as a simple forest ﬁre model [43]. As the result, in order to
capture patch dynamics of the US and Canadian forests, we need to consider more complicated
models.
In particular, if we discretize forest dynamics with respect to both time and state
variable (biomass) we can achieve an adequate representation of forest patch dynamics within
the framework of Markov chains [27, 28, 39]. Markov chains provide an analytically tractable
representation of forest stand dynamics, while they have a discretization error that is challenging
to quantify. This work introduces an autoregressive modeling approach in application to the
forest patch dynamics in Quebec. Theoretically, our modeling approach will deliver stochastic
and analytically tractable models operating with continuous state-space and -time, without
discretization errors.

1.4. Our contributions. Here, we model dynamics of Quebec forests using a traditional AR(1)
process borrowed from quantitative ﬁnance without modiﬁcations. We select the Quebec forest
inventory for this proof of concept work as it is a long term dataset collected over more than 3
decades using the same ﬁeld survey protocol [27]. We operate with the same biomass and basal
area data derived from Quebec forest inventories in our previous publication on Markov chain
modeling (data-mining protocol is available in [25, 27]). For both individual patches and the
Quebec region, we model logarithms of biomass or basal area as autoregressive process. The
best ﬁt, in a certain sense, turns out to be a random walk, with independent increments, which
allows to quantify forest disturbance regime overall at the regional level. Regional averages
are well-described by normal distribution, while individual patches are not: Fluctuations have
heavy tails. This is similar to ﬁnancial markets, with individual stocks having non-normal
ﬂuctuations, and stock indices (in 3–4 years or more) having normal ﬂuctuations. To account
for diﬀering number of observations each year, we use Bayesian analysis for annual averages.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Data mining of Quebec provincial forest inventories. We base our research on Que-
bec forest inventory data 1970–2007 www.mffp.gouv.qc.ca. Each permanent forest inventory
plot has a circular form of 400 m2. The database consists of 32552 plot re-measurements at
11660 diﬀerent locations. The Quebec forest inventory is designed to comprehensive describe
patch mosaic of Quebec forests and plots cover the Quebec territory practically uniformly.
The GIS-based map of forest inventory plots is published as Figure 1 in [28]. Forest inven-
tory plots cover hardwood and mixed forests in the northern temperate zone (9621 and 7663
measurements, respectively) and continuous boreal forests in the boreal zone (11969 measure-
ments). These forest patches (forest inventory plots) are remeasured every few years often with
irregular time intervals between measurements. The inventory plots were aﬀected by natural
and anthropogenic disturbances including ﬁre and harvesting. The statistical analysis of the
measurement dynamics and re-measurement intervals are published in [39] (see Figure 2 in

4

Appendix to [39]). In this inventory, each patch observation includes diameter of each tree, its
species, soil moisture, and other characteristics. This is the raw data which is then converted
to a more tractable data series.
In particular, we are interested in biomass and basal area.
Calculations of biomass and basal area were previously done according to [17]. The computa-
tions of biomass and basal area (as well as other characteristics, such as shade tolerance index,
and biodiversity measured by Shannon entropy) is done in articles [23, 25, 27, 39]. The biomass
is this article refers to the plot biomass, which is the sum of biomasses of all trees computed
using formulas from [17] (see section 3.1 in [27] for the details). The code used for this article
is available on GitHub repository asarantsev/Quebec.

2.2. Autoregressive model for individual forest patches. We propose a new method
of modeling the biomass of an individual patch: autoregressive model, when each next year’s
logarithm of biomass y(t + 1) is a weighted sum of the previous year’s logarithm of biomass
y(t) and a random Gaussian noise. See the primer on autoregressive models in Appendix B.
We measure biomass on a logarithmic scale since it is always positive. That is,

(1)

y(t + 1) = r + ay(t) + ε(t),

(independent identically distributed) N (0, σ2)
where r, a are constants, and ε(t) are i.i.d.
random variables.
If 0 < a < 1, this sequence y(0), y(1), . . . exhibits mean reversion to its
long-term average m = r/(1 − a). That is, if y(t) > m, then y(t + 1) − m is likely to be smaller
than y(t) − m, and vice versa. Examples of earlier use of such models for forest modeling
include [11, 12, 22]. They include also spatial models (incorporating distance between patches).
We shall not attempt it here, instead treating every patch as eﬀectively isolated. Building a
spatial model for Quebec forest is left for future research.

Since data is collected on irregular time intervals, we apply (1) multiple times to itself to get
the expression of y(t1) from y(t0) if t0 and t1 are consecutive years for which this patch was
observed. Then we try various a and obtain for each a the maximum likelihood estimate via
linear regression. We compare these likelihoods and ﬁnd the best ﬁt for a. It turns out to be
a = 1. That is, this sequence actually does not exhibit any mean reversion, but behaves like a
random walk, when each next increment is independent from the past:

y(t + 1) = y(t) + r + ε(t),

ε ∼ N (0, σ2)

i.i.d.

The biomass itself is a geometric random walk: a process whose logarithm is random walk.

However, the residuals for a = 1 do not pass the normality test. This model does not actually
ﬁt well, and we cannot ﬁnd conﬁdence intervals for a using standard statistical techniques. This
is due to noise in measurements of individual patches. Later in the article, we ﬁnd that the
average biomass over all patches exhibits more regular behavior, with normal increments.

We perform two versions of this computation:

for biomass and for basal area. For each
version, we do it in two ways: (a) original logarithms of biomass/basal area; (b) with logarithm
of mean biomass/basal area for this year subtracted. In both cases, the maximum likelihood
estimate gives us random walk a = 1.

The biomass and the basal area are highly dependent, and one can plausibly use one of these

metrics instead of the other.

We inherit these techniques from quantitative ﬁnance. In particular, the geometric random
walk model is a classic model for the stock market movements, going back to classic research
by [10]. Mean reversion is commonly observed in ﬁnancial ratios such as earnings yield or
dividend yield, [1, 16]. See also [4, 7, 13] for this research and inﬂuence of ﬁnancial ratios on
stock market performance. However, these techniques are less known in mathematical biology.

2.3. Annual averages. We are also interested in each year’s average over all patches. We
have only 38 observations for the mean value. Let c(t) be the logarithm of this mean. We ﬁnd
that the random walk adequately describes this:

c(t) = c(t − 1) + µ + ε(t),

ε(t) ∼ N (0, ρ2)

i.i.d.

In particular, we ﬁnd that the increments ε(t) indeed have normal distribution, and not heavy
tails. However, we cannot simply take yearly averages for every year t, since they would have
diﬀerent precision. Reason: each year t has a diﬀerent number of observations. To account
for this, we use Bayesian statistics. We put a prior distribution on the values of µ and ρ2
(which corresponds to the lack of any existing information), and then compute the posterior
distribution from the likelihood. Bayesian techniques are increasingly used in ecology, [9] as
well as in medical statistics [14], and quantitative ﬁnance [35].

3. Results and Discussion

We have 32552 observations of 11660 patches of Quebec forests. Each patch is observed
at most once a year, during 1970–2007. On average, each patch is observed around 3 times:
32552/11660 ≈ 3. Out of these 11660 patches, 10215 have more than one observation, which
allows us to model time dynamics. Each observation consists of 4 numbers: Patch ID; year;
biomass; and basal area. Various patches are observed in diﬀerent years: Patch 7000406701 is
observed only in 1970; patch 7000406901 is observed in 1970 and 1978; patch 8509702201 is
observed in 1985, 1993, 2003; and patch 7000406902 is observed in 1970, 1978, 1985, 1997. Let
P be the set of observed patches. Each p ∈ P has observations x(t, p) at years t ∈ T (p), where
T (p) ⊆ {1970, . . . , 2007}. Let yp(t) := ln x(t, p). Yearly means are deﬁned as:

m(t) :=

1
#{p ∈ P | t ∈ T (p)}

(cid:88)

p:t∈T (p)

x(t, p),

t = 1970, . . . , 2007.

And we deﬁne c(t) = ln m(t). The main diﬃculty is that for almost all patches, a gap between
consecutive observations is more than one year, and it diﬀers from patch to patch. In particular,
there are 3334 pairs of patch-year observations with the same patch and the gap 8 years, 1923
such pairs with the gap 9 years, but only 66 pairs with gap 22 years. More detailed data is in
Appendix D.

3.1. Autoregressive model for individual patches. Consider the following time series:

yp(t) = r + ayp(t − 1) + εp(t),

(2)
where a is an AR(1) parameter, and εp(t) are i.i.d. N (0, σ2). As mentioned earlier, our main
diﬃculty is that we do not have observations for all t and p, only for t ∈ T (p). Assume t, t + u
are subsequent time points in T (p). Then

t = 1970, . . . , 2007, p ∈ P,

We do this both for yp(t) (raw data), ˜yp(t) = yp(t) − c(t) (centered data), and centered data
without t = 1982 and t = 2004. As discussed above, these years have only very few observations,
and we do not have much conﬁdence in these values. We could write the log-likelihood of (3)
and apply maximum likelihood estimate using gradient descent. However, since we do not have
many data points, we can use an equivalent method which is computationally ineﬃcient but
easy to implement: Fix an a and run regression with respect to r. Then choose an a such
that the standard error of this regression is smallest. To properly apply this linear regression,
divide (3) by a constant to make the standard error in error terms in (3) the same for all u:

C(a, u) (y(t + u) − auy(t)) = D(a, u) · r + δp(t + u),

δp(t + u) ∼ N (0, σ2)

i.i.d.

(4)

C(a, u) := (cid:2)1 + a2 + . . . + a2(u−1)(cid:3)−1/2
,
D(a, u) := C(a, u) (cid:2)1 + a + . . . + au−1(cid:3) .

For every a ∈ (−2, 2) which is a multiple of 0.01, ﬁt a simple linear regression (without intercept)
to ﬁnd r and the standard error σ. Appendix A explains why minimizing standard error
given normalized residual variance is equivalent to maximizing likelihood. We do this analysis
three times: for original values, centered values, and centered values with years 1982 and 2004
removed. We repeat this for biomass and basal area. For all six cases, the parameter a = 1
minimizes the standard error (thus maximizing the likelihood). Thus, the dynamics in (2) is
given by yp(t) = r + yp(t − 1) + ε(t), which is a simple random walk with Gaussian increments.

Assuming that the model is, in fact, a random walk, let us make quantile-quantile (QQ) plots
for residuals in (4) (we have simple linear regression without intercept):

u−1/2(y(t + u) − y(t)) = r

u + σεp(t).

sured in m2/ha) in 2007

These QQ plots of residuals in this regression (4) are not normal. Thus more analysis is needed.
For non-centered biomass, the minimal standard error is achieved when a = 1, see Figure 2
(A). This corresponds to a random walk model, and we get σ = 0.223 and r = 0.0378. However,
the residuals are not normal: See them on the QQ plot in Figure 2 (B). Then we repeat the
computation above for centered values: ˜yp(t) = yp(t) − z(t) instead of yp(t). Similarly, the
standard error is minimized for a = 1. For this value, r = 0.0569, σ = 0.224. The QQ plot
of residuals is still not normal. For centered values with years 1982 and 2004 removed, the
standard error once again is minimized for a = 1, with σ = 0.224 and r = 0.00570. The QQ
plot of residuals is still not normal. We omit the standard error graph and the QQ plot for the
last two cases: centered data with all years, and centered data without 1982 and 2004, since
these plots are very similar to their counterparts for original (non-centered) data.

Modeling basal area data as in (2), and computing standard error of the regression (4), we
again get a = 1, r = 0.0337, and σ = 0.207. Again, the best-ﬁtting model among AR(1)
according to the maximum likelihood estimation is the random walk. If we center the basal
area data, and consider all years, then again, the standard error is minimized for a = 1, with
r = 0.00340 and σ = 0.197. Centering the basal area data and removing years 1980 and 2004,
we get: a = 1, r = 0.00341, σ = 0.197. In all these cases, similarly to the case of biomass, the
QQ plots of residuals for basal area are not normal, with both tails fat. We do not provide
pictures of QQ plots, since they are very similar to that for biomass. Correlation between
biomass and basal area: Take all patches p and corresponding years t in T (p) Denote by y(cid:48)
p(t)
the logarithm of biomass, and by y(cid:48)(cid:48)
p (t) the logarithm of basal area for patch p and year t. If
T (p) = {t0, t1, t2, . . .} has more than one year, order them in increasing order: t0 < t1 < t2 < . . .
Compute correlation coeﬃcient between

y(cid:48)

p(tk−1) and y(cid:48)(cid:48)

It is equal to 0.983. With years 1982 and 2004 removed, this number does not change (in
the ﬁrst four decimal digits). Thus biomass and basal area for individual patches are very
correlated. For practical purposes, this means we can use either measure as a size of patch.

3.2. Yearly averages, frequentist analysis. We model the logarithm of yearly average using
random walk:

(5)

(cid:52)c(t) := c(t + 1) − c(t) ∼ N (µ, ρ2)

i.i.d

However, years 1982 and 2004 have only a few observations, see the table from Appendix D.
Thus we do not have much conﬁdence in these results. Thus we do the second test: Remove
these years, and consider increments (5) for t = 1970, . . . , 1981, 1984, . . . , 2003, 2006, 2007. Then
we test normality of increments using the QQ plot and Shapiro-Wilk test. We conﬁrm that,
indeed, increments are i.i.d. normal. Rewrite the model (5) as the random walk:

(6)

c(t) = c(0) + ξ1 + . . . + ξt,

ξi ∼ N (µ, ρ2)

i.i.d.

Or, equivalently, we can rewrite (6) in the original scale, instead of the logarithmic scale:

(7)

m(t) = m(0) exp (ξ1 + . . . + ξt) , t = 0, 1, 2, . . .

From (7), we can compute the mean and variance of m(t):

E[m(t)] = m(0) · exp (cid:0)t(µ + σ2/2)(cid:1); Var[m(t)] = m2(0) · exp(2µt + σ2t) · (cid:0) exp(σ2t) − 1(cid:1).
For the biomass, we get: µ = 0.021 and ρ = 0.512. These increments passes Shapiro-Wilk
normality test with p = 0.80. With removed two years 1982 and 2004, the estimates will not
change much: µ = −0.011 and ρ = 0.507. This still passes Shapiro-Wilk normality test with
p = 0.60. Repeating this analysis for basal area instead of biomass, we get: µ = 0.0240, ρ =
0.367 for all years, and µ = 0.00455, ρ = 0.370 for years without 1982 and 2004. Shapiro-Wilk
test gives us p = 0.89 for all years, and p = 0.58 for years without 1982 and 2004. The QQ
plots in Figure 5 show that, indeed, the residuals are close to normal.

In Figure 3, we plot histograms of the biomass and basal area for an individual patch in
2007. In Figure 4, we simulate biomass and basal area as in (6) until 2019, starting from a
patch randomly selected among observed patches in 2007. We superimpose this histogram upon
the one for 2007.

Taking increments of logarithms of yearly means for biomass and basal area (37 data points),
we get correlation 0.977. For years 1982 and 2004 removed, we get correlation 0.980. Previously,
we got very high correlation between increments of logarithms for individual patches, thus we
conclude that biomass and basal area are the same for practical purposes, as measures of size.
Now we see that the same is true for yearly averages.

3.3. Yearly averages, Bayesian analysis. As mentioned earlier, the analysis in the previous
section is deﬁcient: The means have diﬀerent precision for diﬀerent years, because the quantity
of patches observed diﬀers from year to year. Thus we apply Bayesian statistics in this section.
A primer on Bayesian statistics for normal distribution can be found in Appendix C. Let
for each ﬁxed year t the logarithms of observations are x1(t), . . . , xn(t). For these values we
performed analysis above: The posterior mean µ(t) and the posterior variance v(t) were gen-
erated. The simulation of µ(t) and v(t) was performed N = 1000 times. In Figure 6, we have
histograms of 1000 simulations for µ(t) and σ(t) for t = 0 (year 1970), for both biomass and
basal area. Hence we obtain 38 sequences of N numbers: µ1(t), . . . , µN (t), t = 1970, . . . , 2007.

Thus the growth rate of forest, measured by the biomass or basal area (on the logarithmic
scale), is 2.3% per year. These numbers are close to the ones from frequentist analysis from
the previous subsection: 2.1% with years 1982 and 2004. However, with removed years 1982
and 2004, this estimate changes to −1.1%. For basal area, we have a similar comparison with
the previous subsection: 2.4% with 1982 and 2004, 0.46% without these years. As discussed
earlier, we view Bayesian analysis as the more statistically sound. Thus 2.1% growth per year
seems more reasonable.

From year to year, however, there are a lot of ﬂuctuations, or, to use a stock market term,
0.214 = 0.46, that
0.134 = 0.37, that is, 37% per year for the basal area.

Similarly to the mean estimates, we view these as more scientiﬁcally sound that the ones from
frequentist analysis from the previous subsection.

4. General discussion

4.1. Towards autoregressive theory of forest dynamics. We have applied AR(1) autore-
gressive model to patch/stand dynamics of Quebec forests. Overall, we followed major steps
of application of autoregressive model in ﬁnancial engineering considering stand biomass and
basal area as variables similar to a stock market index. However, forest and stock market
are diﬀerent complex systems despite the observed similarities. We consider this work as the
ﬁrst step, and the further discussion is required: it is hard to expect that the forest dynamics
modeling will simply mirror stock market theory.

One interesting result reported in the Section 2.2 is that a = 1 and the residuals do not pass
the normality test. In simple terms, it means that each forest patch is highly volatile, and its
dynamics cannot be well described by the normal distribution. Still, among all AR(1), random
walk has the maximum likelihood. This suggests for possible use random-walk models with
tails heavier than normal. This dichotomy of average patch vs individual patch reminds us
of a stock market dynamics, where each individual stock is highly volatile, with non-Gaussian
ﬂuctuations [6], but a stock market overall (measured by Standard & Poor 500 or another stock
market index) in the long run follows geometric random walk with normal increments (if the
time step is large enough, say 3-4 years or more).

AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELING OF FOREST DYNAMICS

11

From the perspective of random processes a = 1 means that we are dealing with the diver-
gent AR(1) process, traditionally called the random walk, which does not have a stationary
distribution. The AR(1) converges to its stationary distribution when −1 < a < 1. This means
that biomass and basal area at every step will drift away like in both positive and negative di-
rections. We can search for mechanistic meaning of this result in both fundamental patterns of
forested ecosystem dynamics and in general modeling assumptions related to the autoregressive
modeling approach and the patch dynamics modeling framework.

Patch dynamics modeling framework assumes that each patch, a forest stand in our case, has
the same underlying transition probabilities related to internal changes such as tree growth as
well as with respect to natural disturbances [39]. These are typical background assumptions
of practically all forest models, however the validity of these assumptions should be evaluated.
In particular, in our application we consider the combined data set consisting of hardwood
and mixed temperate forest stands as well as continuous boreal forests. In addition, some of
the stands even in the same forest types are located in diﬀerent climatic conditions and might
be aﬀected by various disturbance regimes. The overall robustness of modeling predictions
with respect to this type of data variability is typically known for traditional models. We
have previously investigated eﬀects of these assumptions in the Markov chain modeling frame-
work [27, 28, 39]. Similarly, individual-based models are often applied for forest simulations
in diﬀerent regions with the same growth/mortality characteristics of particular tree species.
Autoregressive modeling is a new approach in forest modeling, and it is not yet known how
robust our predictions with respect to variability of forest patch mosaic. We can hypothesise
that outcomes reported in the Section 2.2 (a = 0 and the normality test for residuals) might
be related to the variability in forest inventories.

Another common underlying assumption in forest modeling is that the random process is
time homogeneous or stationary [39]. It is often assumed that climatic and disturbance regime
changes occur at the slower scale and can be ignore for the short- and intermediate-term mod-
eling [27]. Time inhomogeneous Markov chains allow to relax this assumption and take into
account both climate driven changes in tree growth and frequency of environmental distur-
bances [28]. Similarly to inhomogeneous Markov chain theory, autoregressive models can be
generalized to include directional changes in disturbance dynamics. This leads us to autore-
gressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, which can capture non-stationary (time
inhomogenous) dynamics. In particular, we previously detected some non-stationary eﬀects re-
lated to the disturbance regimes recorded in the Quebec forest inventory, such as small decrease
of the total disturbance rate in boreal and hardwood forests (see Table 1 in [28]). However, the
relatively small number of the measurements in the data set did not allow us to report some
deﬁnite trend. Nevertheless, we anticipate that the pameterization and validation of ARIMA
models can be an important step towards time series theory of forest patch dynamics.

Time series analysis can also be applied to forest dynamics at diﬀerent hierarchical levels. In a
certain way autoregressive models are continuous time and state counterpart of discrete Markov
chain models. Markov chains were applied at the individual tree and species levels [38,44], stand-
level [42], and landscape-level [29]. The autoregressive and ARIMA models can be also employed
to capture similar dynamics. In addition, time series models might be used in approximation
of the forest gap dynamics and individual-based models.

4.2. Future research. That the random walk with Gaussian increments performed better
than any other AR(1) suggests that there is not much dependence of annual change of the
biomass on the current biomass. However, testing this statement requires further research.

12

OLGA RUMYANTSEVA, ANDREY SARANTSEV, NIKOLAY STRIGUL

Time-series analysis is a novel modeling approach for forest modeling at the large scale.
We wish to compare this approach with state-of-art mathematical models developed on other
principles, in particular with Markov chains [23,25,27,39] and individual-based models [26,41],
developed using the same forest inventory data sets. We also need to understand the merits
of discrete vs continuous space. This is critical for practical applications of forest models
for natural resource management, and risk assessment of forest vulnerability to changes in
environmental disturbance regimes.

We can generalize time series approach to model forest dynamics and climate at the regional
scale. Such generalization in ﬁnancial engineering resulted in the development of vector au-
toregressive integrated moving average (VARIMA) models, which are particularly suited for
multidimensional forest modeling under the dynamic disturbance regimes. This can result in
an enhanced tolerance-disturbance model build upon our past analyses of tolerance patterns
in North American forests, including observed shade tolerance patterns [23], associations be-
tween shade tolerance and soil moisture [25], and relative trade-oﬀs between shade, drought,
and water-logging tolerance at the continental scale [24].

We can extend our research to the USA Forest Inventories: Analysis of current disturbance
regimes across US ecoregions, and how disturbance regimes are connected with other forest
macroscopic characteristics. In particular, forest tolerance is a key ecological driver that controls
the response of forested ecosystems to climate change-related disturbances such as drought-
and ﬁres [24]. We can link climatic models and forest tolerances [23–25]. Spatially-explicit
information from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA),
Canadian Forest Inventory, and climate data sets and models (WorldClim and PRISM), can be
integrated to quantify the eﬀect climate variables in North America have on forest tolerances
and disturbances via recently proposed methodology [24].

5. Conclusion

Individual patches have biomass and basal area whose dynamics (on logarithmic scale) are
not well described by classic autoregressive model y(t + 1) = ay(t) + r + ε(t) with normal noise
terms ε(t), because the tails of these noise terms turn out to be heavier than normal. However,
among these AR(1) models, the best ﬁt (according to the maximum likelihood) is random walk,
with a = 1, and increments y(t + 1) − y(t) independent of the past y(s), s ≤ t. Thus one can
try a heavy-tailed random walk, in which increments have tails heavier than Gaussian. This
topic is left for future research.

In contrast, yearly means (on the log scale) are well described by random walk with normal
increments. Bayesian analysis accounts for the fact that diﬀerent years have diﬀerent number
of observations. We get growth rate (measured on the log scale) 2.3% per year, with standard
deviation 46% for biomass, and 37% for basal area. Thus the forest grows on average in the
long run, but from year to year there is a lot of volatility.

An important part of forest ecological modeling is to quantify disturbances from ﬁres, droughts,
etc. These events quickly destroy signiﬁcant parts of the forest. An analogy for the stock mar-
ket would be a crash, as in 2001 or 2008. Indeed, for the stock market, 1-year ﬂuctuations are
not adequately described by the normal distribution (only 3–4 years or more are). But for the
forest as a whole (as opposed to particular patches), annual ﬂuctuations are normal. We do not
need to introduce separate distributions for modeling disturbances. Since we assume the prior
is Jeﬀrey’s non-informative and the model is Gaussian, we do not need to do any Monte Carlo
or Metropolis-Hastings computations: There are explicit formulas for the posterior distribution
of parameters.

6.1. Maximal likelihood and minimal standard error. Take a family of linear regressions
depending on the parameter a, with d factors and the intercept:

yi = c0(a) + c1(a)xi1 + c2(a)xi2 + . . . + cd(a)xid + εi(a),

Solve for a by maximum likelihood estimation. The Gaussian density for N (0, σ2) is given by

We used crucially here that the residuals in (9) are normalized so that they have the same
variance σ2. To maximize (cid:96) from (11), we need to ﬁrst minimize the standard error s2(a)
by computing it for each a and then choosing an appropriate a; then to choose the σ which
maximizes (11) for given s2(a), which turns out to be σ2 = s2(a).

6.2. Background on autoregressive models and random walk. Consider a time series
of random variables (x0, x1, x2, . . .):

xn = r + axn−1 + εn,

εn ∼ N (0, σ2)

i.i.d.

This is called an autoregressive process of order 1 or AR(1): Regression of this sequence onto
itself with a one-step time lag. It has the following properties. For −1 < a < 1, this sequence
converges weakly to the stationary distribution: N (m, ρ2), with

m =

ρ2 =

This means that for every interval [c, d],

P(c ≤ xn ≤ d) →

In addition, mean and variance of xn converge to that of the limiting distribution: E [xn] → m,
Var [xn] → ρ2. Thus this time series exhibits mean reversion: If xn > m then xn+1 is more
likely to decrease compared to xn than to increase. For a = 1, this is random walk: Increments
xn+1 − xn are independent for diﬀerent n. This sequence does not have a limit as n → ∞. The
expectation E [xn] = E [x0] is constant. But the variance Var[xn] = Var[x0] + nσ2.
6.3. Background on Bayesian inference. Assume we have a sample x1, . . . , xN ∼ N (m, σ2).
Denote the variance by σ2 = v. Random variables x1, . . . , xn are independent, and N (m, v) has
density

(cid:96)(xi | m, v) = (2πv)−1/2 exp

(cid:18)

We set a non-informative prior on (m, v), which means we do not have any existing information
about these parameters: π(m, v) ∝ v−1. This is an inﬁnite measure:

(cid:90) +∞

dv dm = +∞.

Thus we cannot normalize it (divide it by a constant) to make it a probability measure. But we
can still apply Bayesian statistics to this measure. We choose this form of measure because we
can get explicit posterior. Bayesian inference works as follows. The likelihood, that is, density
of x1, . . . , xn given m, v is

L(x1, . . . , xn | m, v) = (cid:96)(x1 | m, v) · . . . · (cid:96)(xn | m, v)

p(m, v | x1, . . . , xn) ∝ π(m, v) · L(x1, . . . , xn | m, v).

Unlike the prior, the posterior is a ﬁnite measure. We can normalize it by computing its integral
and dividing it by this integral. After computation, we get:

That is, v−1 has marginal Gamma distribution with shape n/2 and expectation 1/S; and v
has inverse Gamma distribution with shape n/2. The conditional distribution of m given v
is normal. The unconditional (marginal) distribution of m is Student (t-distribution). A Stu-
dent distribution has heavier tails than a normal distribution, which implies more uncertainty,
resulting from our Bayesian estimation framework.
