Abstract. One of the main objectives of the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS
is to study properties of strongly interacting matter. This paper presents new results on
observables relevant for this part of the NA61/SHINE programme. These include the ﬁrst
ever measurements of φ meson production in p+p collisions at 40 and 80 GeV, and most
detailed ever experimental data at 158 GeV. This contribution demonstrates the superior
accuracy of the present dataset with respect to existing measurements. The comparison
of p+p to Pb+Pb collisions shows a non-trivial system size dependence of the longitu-
dinal evolution of hidden strangeness production, contrasting with that of other mesons.
Furthermore, proton density ﬂuctuations are investigated as a possible order parameter
of the second order phase transition in the neighbourhood of the critical point (CP) of
strongly interacting matter. An intermittency analysis is performed of the proton sec-
ond scaled factorial moments in transverse momentum space. A previous analysis of
this sort revealed signiﬁcant power-law ﬂuctuations for the “Si”+Si system at 158A GeV
measured by the NA49 experiment. The ﬁtted power-law exponent was consistent within
errors with the theoretically expected critical value, a result suggesting a baryochemi-
cal potential in the vicinity of the CP of about 250 MeV [24]. The analysis will now
be extended to NA61/SHINE systems of similar size, Be+Be and Ar+Sc, at 150A GeV.
Finally, spectator-induced electromagnetic (EM) eﬀects on charged meson production
are being studied and bring information on the space-time position of the pion forma-
tion zone, which appears to be much closer to the spectator system for faster pions than
for slower ones. On that basis, we demonstrate that the longitudinal evolution of the
system at CERN SPS energies may be interpreted as a pure consequence of local energy-
momentum conservation.

1 Introduction
NA61/SHINE [1] is a ﬁxed target experiment at the CERN SPS accelerator complex. Its strong in-
teractions programme is a continuation and extension of the NA49 experiment [2], following NA49’s
discovery of the onset of deconﬁnement in Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV beam momentum [3, 4].
NA61/SHINE performs the ﬁrst two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram of strongly interacting
matter (SIM) by varying the momentum and size of the colliding nuclei, in search for the critical
point of SIM and to study properties of the onset of deconﬁnement. Of interest to this programme
are thus strangeness production (section 2), ﬂuctuations of baryon density (section 3) and space-time
properties of the medium created in heavy ion collisions (section 4).

scale). Also outlined are the coordinate system used in the experiment and the conﬁguration of beam detectors
used with secondary proton beams for p+p interactions for which φ meson production results are presented.

The main parts of the NA61/SHINE detector system (Fig. 1) were inherited from the NA49 exper-
iment. Large volume Time Projection Chambers (TPC), two of them immersed in vertical magnetic
ﬁelds, allow precise measurement of momenta of charged particles down to pT = 0 and provide
particle identiﬁcation (PID) via the dE/dx method. Time of Flight (ToF) walls complement PID ca-
pabilities. The Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD), a hadron calorimeter, measures forward-going
energy allowing to estimate the centrality of nuclear collisions.

2 Hidden strangeness production in proton-proton collisions

The φ meson, consisting of s and s valence quarks, is a particle with hidden strangeness. Motivation
for measurement of its production in p+p collisions is twofold. First, it is useful in itself to constrain
hadron production models. Second, it may serve as reference for Pb+Pb measurements at the same
energies to identify strangeness-related phenomena speciﬁc to heavy ion collisions.

In this contribution, diﬀerential multiplicities of φ mesons in p+p interactions at 40, 80 and
158 GeV beam momenta, as a function of rapidity y and transverse momentum pT , are obtained from
invariant mass spectra in the φ → K+K− decay channel. In Fig. 2 one can see pT spectra in rapidity
bins for the 158 GeV data set. Similar double-diﬀerential spectra are also measured for 80 GeV, while
due to low track statistics, only single-diﬀerential analysis, separately in y and in pT , was feasible for
the 40 GeV data. These are the ﬁrst ever diﬀerential measurements of φ production at 40 and 80 GeV
and the ﬁrst double-diﬀerential measurements at 158 GeV.

Transverse momentum spectra are compared to three models: Epos 1.99 [5, 6] from the Crmc 1.6.0
package [7], Pythia 6.4.28 [8] and UrQMD 3.4 [9, 10]. Model predictions in Fig. 2 are normalized to
the integral of the data in each rapidity bin to focus only on shape comparison. One sees that Pythia
describes well the shape, while the spectra from UrQMD are too hard and those from Epos too soft.

√

Having the double diﬀerential spectra it is possible to calculate the single diﬀerential spectra of
rapidity integrated over pT by summation of the measured pT region and extrapolation to large pT .
The latter is done using a thermally motivated ﬁt function pT emT /T (thick curves in Fig. 2). The
unmeasured tail contribution is smaller than 1% for all y bins in Fig. 2.

The resulting rapidity distributions are shown in Fig. 3 for all studied energies. Again the shape
comparison with the three models is performed using the same normalization scheme as for pT spec-
tra. In this case both Epos and UrQMD predict shapes comparable to that of the data, while Pythia
produces a distribution which is too narrow. For the largest energy, single diﬀerential measurements
in narrower rapidity range, are available from NA49 [11]. It is clear that the two measurements are
consistent.

In order to calculate total φ multiplicities, distributions are ﬁtted with Gaussian functions1 (solid
curves in Fig. 3). Again summation of the measured spectrum is done and the unmeasured tail contri-
bution from the ﬁt is added (3% to 7% depending on energy). Then the result is doubled to account
for the backward hemisphere from collision symmetry. The energy dependence of the obtained total
φ yields is shown in Fig. 4 and compared to world data [11–15]. Clearly NA61/SHINE results are

1It should be noted that for φ meson rapidity distributions a double Gaussian (dashed curves in Fig. 3) does not provide any

advantage over a single Gaussian function contrary to the case of charged hadrons in p+p [18].

consistent with the world data, but are much more accurate. The ﬁgure also shows a comparison of φ
yields with models, including the hadron resonance gas (HRG [16]) statistical model. It is apparent
that while Epos describes the data reasonably well (although the rise with collision energy is too fast),
all other models fail with UrQMD underestimating and HRG overestimating the yield by about a
factor of 2.

Figure 5 demonstrates the enhancement of strange meson production in Pb+Pb collisions com-
pared to p+p reactions. Data on φ in Pb+Pb and other mesons in both systems come from
Refs. [3, 4, 17, 18]. Multiplicities of strange mesons are divided by those of pions to take out the
“trivial” eﬀect of the size of the colliding system. In case of the φ, the mean total yield of pions is
used which was calculated as Ref. [17]:

and pion data are taken from Ref. [18].

It is evident from Fig. 5 (left), that the φ/π ratio increases with energy for both systems. The enhance-
ment from p+p to central Pb+Pb collisions is about a factor 3.

Dividing the Pb+Pb by the p+p ratios one gets the double ratio:

double ratio ((cid:104)φ(cid:105) / (cid:104)π(cid:105)) = ((cid:104)φ(cid:105) / (cid:104)π(cid:105))Pb+Pb

which is shown by the full circles in Fig. 5 (right). The analogous ratio for kaons is also plotted in
Fig. 5 (right). It is apparent that the enhancement of φ production is comparable to that of K+, while
the enhancement for K− is systematically smaller. Furthermore the enhancement of φ production is
about the square of the K− enhancement, consistent with the hypothesis of strangeness enhancement
in a parton phase of the collision.

Finally, Fig. 6 shows the widths σy of rapidity distributions of φ mesons and various other particles
in p+p and central Pb+Pb collisions [3, 4, 11, 17–20] as a function of beam rapidity ybeam in the centre-
of-mass frame. Widths are derived from single or double Gaussian ﬁts depending on the particle
species. It is striking that all particles in both colliding systems, except φ in Pb+Pb follow the same
trend: σy is proportional to ybeam in the studied range, with the same slope of increase with energy.
While the eﬀect was already known from Ref. [17], the new NA61/SHINE results emphasize the
peculiarity of the system size dependence of the longitudinal evolution of φ production, contrasting
with that of other mesons.

It should be noted, that the behaviour of σy for φ mesons in Pb+Pb collisions is qualitatively
consistent with rescattering of kaons from φ mesons decaying inside the ﬁreball [17, 21]. Such kaons
no longer contribute to the signal peak in the invariant mass spectrum.
It is more likely to take
place for slow kaons (i.e. those coming from low rapidity φ mesons), which travel longer through the
ﬁreball. Therefore, the φ rapidity spectrum gets depleted and this loss is the highest at midrapidity
and decreases with increasing y values. So the spectrum becomes wider due to the rescattering. The

eﬀect should increase with the collision energy, because the higher the energy, the larger and denser
the ﬁreball. Moreover, it is natural to assume that the eﬀect would be much stronger in a quark gluon
plasma, than in a purely hadronic medium. This shows the importance of investigating the system
size dependence of the eﬀect for systems between p+p and Pb+Pb, for which data are collected by
NA61/SHINE.

3 Search for the QCD critical point via intermittency analysis

In the vicinity of the critical point of strongly interacting matter increased ﬂuctuations in the system
are expected in analogy to critical opalescence in liquid-vapour phase transitions. Therefore the pro-
cedure of the search for the CP is to scan the phase diagram of SIM by varying energy and size of
colliding nuclei and look for a maximum in ﬂuctuation observables.

Among various ﬂuctuation measures, this contribution focuses on local, power-law ﬂuctuations
of baryon density. These are studied by calculating second scaled factorial moments F2 in transverse
momentum space (py vs. px) of protons in midrapidity:

where the (px, py) space is divided into M bins, nm is the number of protons in bin number m and (cid:104). . .(cid:105)
denotes averaging over events. For a critical system, F2 is expected to scale according to a speciﬁc
power law with the bin size or equivalently number of bins M. This scaling is called intermittency and
the corresponding exponent is called the intermittency index φ2 [22]. However, it is also expected that
in addition to protons stemming from a critical system, there is some non-critical background. The
latter is estimated using event mixing. So ﬁnally the correlator

should scale for M (cid:29) 1 proportionally to (M2)ϕ2 with intermittency index ϕ2 = 5/6 [23].

colliding systems at top CERN SPS energy, measured by NA49 [24] and NA61/SHINE.

Figure 7 shows F2(M) as measured by NA49 for several systems at 158A GeV [24]. It is seen
that data and mixed events plots overlap for the “C”+C and Pb+Pb systems2, so no intermittency
is observed there. In the “Si”+Si system, on the other hand, there is a clear separation of data and
mixed events, so ∆F2(M) can be calculated and ﬁtted. The intermittency index ϕ2 = 0.96+0.38
−0.25(stat.) ±
0.16(syst.) thus obtained is consistent, within uncertainties,3 with the theoretical predictions for a
critical system. Figure 7 also shows F2(M) for the Be+Be system measured by NA61/SHINE at the
top SPS energy. No evidence for intermittency is observed there, consistent with NA49 results, as the
Be+Be system is lighter than “C”+C and therefore yet further away from the “Si”+Si system. Finally,
the analysis for the heavier Ar+Sc system in NA61/SHINE is ongoing [25].

4 Electromagnetic effects in pion emission

Charged spectators in non-central heavy ion collisions generate electromagnetic ﬁelds, which modify
trajectories of ﬁnal state charged particles (most of them are pions). Oppositely charged particles are
aﬀected oppositely, leading to charge asymmetries in distributions of produced particles. One example
of such asymmetries is charge splitting of directed ﬂow v1 visible in Fig. 8(a) for Au+Au collisions
measured by the STAR experiment [26]. It was explained by the spectator-induced electromagnetic
(EM) eﬀects assuming that the distance dE between the pion formation zone and the spectator was of
the order of 3 fm [27].

Taking together results of three similar analyses of EM eﬀects in three diﬀerent data sets on
Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions [26, 28, 29], the dependence of dE on pion rapidity, shown in Fig. 8(b),
was obtained [30]. It is visible, that faster pions are produced closer to the spectator system.

The latter observation was explained in Ref. [31] in a new, independent realization of the ﬁre streak
model [32], sketched in Figs. 8(c) and (d). In the collision centre-of-mass frame, the two incoming
nuclei are represented as two continuous, Lorentz-contracted 3D mass distributions deﬁned by the
known nuclear density proﬁles [33]. They are then divided into “bricks” in the transverse plane of the
collision. Each brick collides independently with the one from the opposite nucleus, forming a “ﬁre
streak”. For each pair, local energy-momentum conservation is assumed, which yields the excitation
energy E∗
s and rapidity ys for each ﬁre streak.4 The ﬁnal ingredient of the model is that each ﬁre streak

of pion rapidity y with free parameters A, r, σy independent of the ﬁre streak and collision centrality,

conservation rule. From the distribution of ﬁre streak velocities, depicted as thick arrows in Fig. 8(d),
and formula (5) one ﬁnds that on average, pions produced closer to the spectator system are moving
faster.

Summing formula (5) over all ﬁre streaks, one obtains the full rapidity spectrum of pions. The ﬁt
of the model to data from NA49 [34] for diﬀerent centrality classes is shown in Fig. 9. It is apparent
that the model describes well the dependence on centrality of both the yields of pions and shapes of
pion rapidity spectra. This means that the longitudinal evolution of the system at CERN SPS energies
can be interpreted as a pure consequence of local energy-momentum conservation.

Finally, it should be noted that apart from three measurements leading to the results in Fig. 8(b),

an analysis of EM eﬀects for Ar+Sc collisions in the NA61/SHINE experiment is ongoing [25].

5 Summary

New results on observables relevant for the strong interactions programme of the NA61/SHINE ex-
periment were presented. They include the ﬁrst ever diﬀerential measurements of φ meson production
in p+p collisions at 40 and 80 GeV beam momentum and the ﬁrst double-diﬀerential measurements
at 158 GeV. These results were compared to world data on p+p collisions showing consistency and

superior accuracy of the new measurements. It was also demonstrated that none of the considered
models is able to describe all the properties of φ production in the measured reactions. Finally, the
comparison of p+p to Pb+Pb collisions shows a non-trivial system size dependence of the longitu-
dinal evolution of hidden strangeness production, contrasting with that of other mesons. The latter
observation emphasizes the importance of the analysis of Be+Be, Ar+Sc and Xe+La data collected
by NA61/SHINE.

Regarding the search for the QCD critical point, it was shown that there is some evidence from
NA49 for intermittency in “Si”+Si collisions at 158A GeV and none detected by NA49 in “C”+C,
Pb+Pb, nor by NA61/SHINE in Be+Be interactions at the same energy. The analysis in Ar+Sc reac-
tions is ongoing.

Spectator-induced electromagnetic eﬀects in pion emission bring information on the space-time
position of the pion formation zone, which appears to be much closer to the spectator system for
faster pions than for slower ones. On that basis, it has been demonstrated that the longitudinal evolu-
tion of the system at CERN SPS energies can be interpreted as a pure consequence of local energy-
momentum conservation.
