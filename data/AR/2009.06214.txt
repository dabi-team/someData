Abstract—Topology identiﬁcation (TI) is a key task for state
estimation (SE) in distribution grids, especially the one with high-
penetration renewables. The uncertainties, initiated by the time-
series behavior of renewables, will almost certainly lead to bad
TI results without a proper treatment. These uncertainties are
analytically intractable under conventional framework—they are
usually jointly spatial-temporal dependent, and hence cannot be
simply treated as white noise. For this purpose, a hybrid frame-
work is suggested in this paper to handle these uncertainties in a
systematic and theoretical way; in particular, big data analytics are
studied to harness the jointly spatial-temporal statistical properties
of those uncertainties. With some prior knowledge, a model bank
is built ﬁrst to store the countable typical models of network
conﬁgurations; therefore, the difference between the SE outputs
of each bank model and our observation is capable of being
deﬁned as a matrix variate—the so-called random matrix. In order
to gain insight into the random matrix, a well-designed metric
space is needed. Auto-regression (AR) model, factor analysis (FA),
and random matrix theory (RMT) are tied together for the metric
space design, followed by jointly temporal-spatial analysis of those
matrices which is conducted in a high-dimensional (vector) space.
Under the proposed framework, some big data analytics and
theoretical results are obtained to improve the TI performance.
Our framework is validated using IEEE standard distribution
network with some ﬁeld data in practice.

I. INTRODUCTION

T Opology identiﬁcation (TI) of admittance matrix Y, the

so-called network topology, is a precondition for state
estimation (SE) in distribution systems. Inaccurate TI has long
been cited as a major cause of bad SE results [1]. During a
daily operation, Y may be partially reconﬁgured [2]. While the
knowledge of Y is crucial, it may be unavailable or outdated
(via TI) due to some reasons [3–7]. Among these reasons,
the uncertainties caused by the behavior of high-penetration
renewables [8, 9], which are analytically intractable for most
tools, are one of the main challenges. How to address these
uncertainties by harnessing their jointly spatial-temporal
statistical properties is at the heart of our study, and this
question threads throughout the proposed hybrid framework.

A. Related Work and Motivation of our Work

Ref. [10–12] are relevant to our paper to an extent. Ref. [10]
builds a model bank, and then conducts TI task by applying a
recursive Bayesian approach to identify the correct network

This work was partly supported by National Key Research & Development
(R&D) plan of China (grant No. 2016YFB0901300), and National Natural
Science Foundation of China (grant No. 51907121 and No. U1866206).

conﬁguration in the bank. Ref. [11] conducts TI task by
comparing the collected voltage time series with a library
of signatures computed a priori. Ref. [12] formulates the TI
problem as a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP)
model to ﬁnd a topology conﬁguration with weighted least
square (WLS) of measurement residues.

Several data-driven TI approaches, as Ref. [3–7], are pro-
posed recently. They are mainly based on iterations, graph the-
ory, sparsity-based regularization, and so on. These approaches
are feasible to TI task with very little knowledge about the
network. Ref. [6] tells that an accurate TI result is acquirable
only if the noise is well addressed. For instance, even with
a small error in measurements, the regression-based method
may fail in TI task (see Sec. V-C in Case Studies). Most TI
algorithms, especially those derived from least square, rely
heavily on the second-order statistics of meter data [4, 5], and
hence they are applicable to (Gaussian) white noise.

Renewables-derived uncertainties (e.g., randomness caused
by a gust of wind), however, often exhibit themselves as
non-Gaussian noise. The conventional statistics such as
ﬁrst/second-order statistics (mean/variance) are even not nearly
enough to represent these non-Gaussian variables, and the
(jointly spatial-temporal) dependence should be taken into
account. Therefore, there is an urgent need for some powerful
approach to make these uncertainties analytically tractable
with a systematic and theoretical procedure. This is the
major motivation and superiority of our proposed hybrid
framework. Under our framework, some statistical properties
and theoretical results are established.

B. Our Work and its Contributions

In order to handle the renewables-derived uncertainties, we
have to go back to the model bank following Ref. [10, 11]. It
is reasonable and feasible to list all the possible models in
practice with prior knowledge, since the network conﬁguration
of a particular grid must be conﬁned to only a few typical
models. Because of the bank, the difference between the bank
model SE output and our observation is capable of being
deﬁned as a matrix variate—the so-called random matrix.

Then we move to the heart of our hybrid framework—high-
dimensional analytics of the random matrix. Auto-regression
(AR) model, factor analysis (FA), and random matrix theory
(RMT) are tied together for the jointly temporal-spatial
modeling and analysis of the random matrices. And high-
dimensional statistics are obtained as big data analytics. This
framework enables us to gain insight
into the (multiple)
renewables-derived uncertainties, which are analytically in-
tractable under conventional framework.

 
 
 
 
 
 
In particular, our framework deals with a large number
(spatial space, N ) of nodes simultaneously, and each node
(i = 1, ..., N ) samples time-series within a given duration
(temporal space, T ) of observation. Classical statistic theories
treat ﬁxed N only (often small,
typically N < 6 [13]) .
This ﬁxed (small) N is called the low-dimensional regime.
In practice, we are interested in the case that N can vary
arbitrarily in size compared with T (often T is large, typically
N > 20, c = N/T > 0 [13]). This fundamental requirement
is the primary driving force for us to study big data analytics
with high-dimensional statistics. For jointly spatial-temporal
analysis, a (large-dimensional) data matrix, rather than a
vector or a scalar [14], is adopted as the basis.

This work is expected to contribute some insight to the
(multiple) renewables-derived uncertainties that are often an-
alytically intractable. We take advantage of high-dimensional
statistics that is made analytically tractable only recently [15,
this type of analysis is, for the
16]. To our knowledge,
ﬁrst time, conducted in the context of TI. Our big data
analytics are motivated to improve TI performance, and may
be further expanded to other applying ﬁelds: the detection
and localization of faults [17], the detection of unmonitored
switching of circuit breakers in network reconﬁguration [18],
etc.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

- Sec. II presents the hybrid framework and gives a general

discussion about it.

- Sec. III, by employing the model bank, aims to convert our
observation into a random matrix with prior knowledge.
- Sec. IV studies the high-dimensional statistics of the random

matrices based on AR, FA, and RMT.

- Sec. V validates our framework with case studies based on
IEEE standard distribution network using some ﬁeld data.

II. HYBRID FRAMEWORK OF TOPOLOGY IDENTIFICATION

A. Hybrid Framework

Fig. 1 summarizes the presented framework by illustrating
how Model Bank, AR, FA, RMT are put together coherently.
The hybrid framework mainly consists of two parts—the
model-based part (Sec. III) and the data-driven part (Sec. IV).
The former, with prior knowledge, converts the observed data
into “difference” in the form of random matrix. Starting from
the random matrix and going through a rigorous mathematic
procedure, the latter aims to gain insight into the uncertainties
through big data analytics, with a focus on the jointly spatial-
temporal analysis and the underlying theories/tools.

First, we build “bank” (referring to [10]) to store countable
(often a few) virtual models mapping the possible network
conﬁgurations of a real grid. The bank can be seen as the
universal set of possible models among which we try to
pick out the most likely one. Hence, we need a well-designed
metric space—a set together with a metric deﬁned on it.

The SE for the models, mainly based on power ﬂow (PF)
analysis, is the second step. We make an assumption that each
agent on distributed nodes (Agent i on Node i for instance)
does collect some local information, such as power usage (Pi)
and voltage magnitude (Vi), on its own access point (Node

2

i). However, it has no prior information about how it is
connected via power lines in the network, not to mention
power ﬂow on the branch (Pi,j and Qi,j). The information on
Pi,j and Qi,j is often a precondition for some SE algorithms
[12], but not for ours. From this aspect, our assumption is
practical and ﬂexible for engineering scenarios.

Then we move forwards to the difference X, which is
modeled as a non-Gaussian random matrix for further big data
analytics. For each bank model (Model Mm for instance), its
SE output ( ˆZm) does provide a comparison for our observation
(Zob), and then the difference Xm is deﬁned as

(1)

Xm = Zob − ˆZm.
Each Xm consists of multiple time-series, which can
be generally decomposed into four components—the trend,
the seasonality, the mutation, and the randomness. Feature
extraction of the trend and the seasonality is a well discussed
topic in time-series analysis [19], and our previous work [20]
has proposed an RMT-based mutation detection algorithm to
handle sudden changes. Here we focus on the randomness.

B. Non-Gaussian Randomness Tools and Related Work

The randomness component of renewables-derived uncer-
tainties cannot be simply modeled as white noise—successive
observed data in the form of time-series usually show
serial dependence. In order to formally incorporate this
(temporal) dependent structure, it is reasonable to explore a
general class of models called auto-regressive (AR) models—
xt = (cid:80)p
i=1 bixt−1 + (cid:15)t [21]. From the spatial aspect, FA
and RMT are tied together to conduct jointly temporal-spatial
analysis of the dependence among those multiple time-series.
1) Factor Analysis: FA is often used for dimension reduction
in high-dimensional datasets [15]. Because of the latent
constructs (e.g., spatial-temporal independence) lying in the
sampling data, FA is preferred to principal component anal-
ysis (PCA) [22]. FA has already been successfully applied
in various ﬁelds such as statistics [23] and econometrics
[24]. Ref. [25] employs FA to handle high-frequency data
in ﬁnancial market. In power system domain, our previous
work [26] applies FA to anomaly detection and location
with both simulated data and ﬁeld data.

2) Random Matrix Theory: The entries of a random matrix
are random variables and the matrix size is often very
large, so RMT is naturally connected with our problem at
hand. The goal of RMT is to understand the joint eigen-
value distribution in the asymptotic regime as the statistic
analytics from big data. To our best knowledge, RMT is
developed to address this high-dimensional regime since
classical statistic theories apply to low-dimensional regime
only [13]. Recently, RMT has already been successfully
applied in many ﬁelds of power system [20].

3) ARMA+RMT: This mode is relevant to our big data ana-
lytics. Ref. [27] employs the free random variables (FRV)
calculus to calculate the empirical spectral density (ESD) of
the sample covariance for several VARMA-type processes.
The derivation is RMT-based and mathematically rigorous;
the theoretical result is nicely matched against the spectra
obtained via Monte Carlo simulations.

III. MODEL-BASED PART UTILIZING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE

This part aims to convert our observed data into “difference”
in the form of random matrices. With PF analysis, the SE
output of each bank model is computed as Zm. It supplies
a comparison for our observed data Zob, and hence the
difference is capable of being deﬁned (Eq. 1).

Abstractly, a physical power system obeying Eq. (2) can be
viewed as an analog engine—it takes bus voltage magnitude V
and phase angel θ as inputs, conductance G and susceptance
B as given parameters, and “computes” active power injec-
tion P and reactive power injection Q as outputs. Thus, the
entries of Jacobian matrix J, i.e. [J]ij, are deﬁned as the partial
derivatives of the outputs, P and Q, with respect to the inputs,
V and θ. All in all, J consists of four parts H, N, K, L:

assumption-based. That is to say, the information of network
topology Y is a prerequisite for the calculation, and the input
(output) variables need to be preset as one of the following
three categories:

• P and V (Q and θ) for voltage controlled bus/P V bus;
• P and Q (V and θ) for load bus/P Q bus;
• V and θ (P and Q) for reference bus/slack bus.
Consider a power system with n buses, among which there
are m P V buses, l P Q buses, and 1 slack bus (n = l+m+1).
Starting with Eq. (2), PF functions is formulated as Eq. (4).

Eq. (4) builds a differentiable mapping function f : x ∈

the same number (m+2l = K) state variables, θ and V , to the
power injections, P and Q. Following Eq. (3), J is calculated
as a K ×K matrix:

B. Power Flow Analysis

PF analysis deals mainly with the calculation of steady-
state system status, i.e., voltage magnitude V and phase angel
θ, on each network bus, for a given set of variables such as
load demands, under certain assumptions such as in a balanced
system operation [28]. Conventional PF analysis is model- and

The iteration depicts how to update the state variables from
x(k) to x(k+1). y(k) and x(k) are known quantities under our
assumption in Sec. II-A. y(k+1), according to Eq. (4), is the
desired P, Q on P Q buses and desired P on P V buses1.

1For P Q buses, neither V nor θ are ﬁxed; they are state variables that need

to be estimated. For P V buses, V is ﬁxed, and θ needs to be estimated.

The above model-based deterministic PF analysis is not
always reliable in practice, since the network topology Y,
and the operation points (x(k), y(k)) are required to be of high
precision and up-to-date. These requirements, unfortunately,
are often unrealistic as mentioned in Sec I.

C. Model Bank

During the daily operation of a distribution grid, its topol-
ogy may be partially reconﬁgured due to maintenance or
emergency/optimal operation. Taking IEEE 33-bus network
for instance, the network topology is shown in Fig. 2. It is a
12.66-kV distribution grid system including a substation and
37 branches. The normally closed branches are represented by
solid lines, and normally opened ones by dashed lines.

Fig. 2: IEEE 33-bus Network

With the pair switch of these normally closed/opened
branches, the grid has ‘countable’ possible network conﬁgu-
rations. In practice, however, it is reasonable to study only
a few models even for a large system, since the network
conﬁguration of a particular grid must be conﬁned to several
typical models. We employ the concept of ‘bank’ referring to
[10] to store them, and the deterministic PF analysis works
out the SE results of these models as ˆZm. These SE outputs
ˆZm allow of the comparison with our observed data Zob, and
hence the difference X is capable of being deﬁned as a random
matrix (Eq. 1). In this way, the TI task is converted into a
matching problem under certain metric space. The design
of the metric space will be discussed in Sec. IV-E.

IV. HIGH-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS WITH RMT AND FA
Our motivation arises from the fact that the renewables-
derived uncertainties cannot be simply modeled as white
noise. It does contain much (latent) structural information,
especially when there is an extra bias caused by a certain
(although maybe unknown) poor assumption or negligence.
For this purpose, FA is employed in our framework. The
entries of the resultant matrix are random variables and large
in size, so RMT is naturally relevant to the problem [20].

A. RMT-based Problem Formulation

The goal of RMT is to understand joint eigenvalue dis-
tribution in the asymptotic regime as big data analytics.
The spectrum of a covariance matrix generally consists of
two parts: A few spikes/outliers and the bulk. The former
represents common factors that mainly drive the features, and
the latter represents unique factors or error variation that
arise from idiosyncratic noise. For the noise part, we consider

4

a minimum distance between two spectral densities—a theo-
retical one ρT from an ideal structure model, and an empirical
one ρE relevant to the (multiple time-series) observed data.

B. Factor Analysis Formula

In dealing with high-dimensional datasets, FA is often used
for dimension reduction in sampling data with underlying
constructs that cannot be measured directly [15, 22].

Regarding empirical data X ∈ RN ×T , FA is formulated as
X = L(p)F(p) + R.
(7)
where F ∈ Rp×T is a matrix of common factors, L ∈ RN ×p
is factor loadings, p is factor numbers, and R ∈ RN ×T is
residues, also called unique factors or error variation.

Eq. (7) enables to decompose observed data X into system-
atic information and idiosyncratic noise. Usually, only X is
observable, L is composed of the ﬁrst p principal components
of X, F = (cid:0)LTL(cid:1)−1

LTX, and R = X − LF.
We focus on residues R, which may contain some latent
constructs and statistical information. Instead of regarding R
as Gaussian noise a priori, we assume that there are cross-
and auto-correlated structures. Without loss of generality,
ˆR is represented as

ˆR = A1/2

N (cid:15)B1/2

T

(8)

where (cid:15) is an N × T Gaussian matrix with independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) random entries, AN and BT are
N × N and T × T symmetric non-negative deﬁnite matrices,
representing cross- and auto- covariances, respectively. Eq. (8)
leads to a separable sample covariance matrix in the sense
that AN and BT are separable. This structural assumption of
separability is a popular assumption in the analysis of spatial-
temporal data [16]. Although this assumption does not allow
for spatial-temporal interactions in the covariance matrix, in
many real data applications, the covariance matrix can be
well approximated using separable covariance matrices for
a space-time covariance matrix problem.

C. FA Estimation Based on Spectrum Analysis

Now the objective of the mentioned matching problem is to

match the spectral density ρE against ρT.

The former ρE means the ESD of the covariance matrix
of residues R constructed from empirical data. It can be
controlled by the p number of common factors to be removed
following Eq. (7). It is deﬁned as [29]

A difﬁculty lies in the calculation of the limiting density,
ρT(θ), for general θ = (θAN , θBT ). The actual calculation
of ρT(θ) is quite complex, which makes the implementation
difﬁcult. A recent study of [27], fortunately, provides the direct
derivation of this limiting spectral density using free random
variable (FRV) techniques. They particularly present analytic
forms when the time-series follow ARMA processes. In our
task, we employ these techniques to calculate ρT(θ). First,
two assumptions are made:

I. The cross-correlations of ˆR are effectively eliminated
by removing p factors, and therefore ˆR has sufﬁciently
negligible cross-correlation: AN ≈ IN ×N .

II. The auto-correlations of ˆR are exponentially decreasing,

i.e., {BT }ij = b|i−j|, with |b| < 1.2

Under the two assumptions, we can conduct spectrum
analysis of the simpliﬁed model, and thus ρT(b) is capable of
being computed. The major steps are brieﬂy given as follows:

1. The mean spectral density can be derived from the Green’s

function G(z) by using the Sokhotsky’s formula:

ρT(λ) = −

1
π

lim
ε→0+

ImG(λ + iε).

(10)

2. The Green’s function G(z) can be obtained from the

moments’ generating function M (z) :

G(z) =

M (z) + 1
z

,

|z| (cid:54)= 0.

(11)

3. M (z) can be found by solving the polynomial equation:

a4c2M 4 + 2a2c(−(1 + b2)z + a2c)M 3 + ((1 − b2)2z2
,
−2a2c(1 + b2)z + (c2 − 1)a4)M 2 − 2a4M − a4 = 0

√

where a =

1 − b2, and c = N
T .

(12)

It is worth mentioning that when b = 0, Assumptions I & II
imply that ˆR is a standard Gaussian matrix with i.i.d. random
elements, and its spectral density is marked as ρT(0). On the
other side, Marchenko-Pastur Law says that for a Laguerre
unitary ensemble (LUE) matrix Γ ∈ CN×T (c = N/T ≤ 1), its
spectral density gMP (x) does follow M-P Law [31]:

gMP (x) =

1
2πcx

(cid:112)(x − s1) (s2 − x),

where s1 = (1 −

√

c)2 and s2 = (1 +

√

c)2.

x ∈ [s1, s2]

(13)

The two spectral densities should be equivalent, i.e. ρT(0)

is equivalent to gMP. Fig. 3 displays this phenomenon.

Fig. 3b also tells that the theoretical spectral densities ρT(b)
are distinguishable with different coefﬁcients b in the AR
model. This property implies that the (latent) coefﬁcients b
offers good potential for the metric space construction.
With the help of metric space, the randomness component of
the observed data is able to be addressed from the view of
spectrum analysis.

2This is equivalent to modeling residues as an AR(1) process: ˆRit =

b ˆRi,t−1 +ξit, where ξ ∼ N (cid:0)0, 1 − b2(cid:1) so that the variance of ˆRt is 1.

E. Metric Space Designing

To design a metric space for solving the mentioned match
problem, we need to assign a set and then deﬁne a distance
function (metric) on it. What we have in practice are the
observed data Zob in the form of multiple time-series, and SE
outputs ˆZm derived from Zob and Model Mm. The difference
(Eq. 1: Xm = Zob − ˆZm) is the ﬁrst and most obvious choice
for us to extract some statistical information from.

Before designing the metric space,

let us look through
those conventional statistics indexes, e.g., ﬁrst/second moment
(mean/variance). We have already argued that
the proﬁle
of renewables-derived uncertainties does follow AR models.
Mean and variance contain enough statistical information for
an i.i.d. Gaussian random variable, but insufﬁcient for an AR
model, not to mention multiple AR processes (temporal aspect)
on those connected distributed access points (spatial aspect).
Some more powerful tools are needed to map the difference
Xm, which consists of a large number of random variables,
into some indicator within a well designed metric space. The
proposed hybrid framework (Fig. 1) conducts jointly temporal-
spatial analysis of Xm as follows: First, X is converted into
R with a given p (Eq. 7), and then the ESD ρE is calculated
(Eq. 9). On the other hand, with a given coefﬁcient b, the
theoretical spectral density ρT(b) is capable of being computed
(Eq. 8→12→11→10). For convenience, the metric distance
such as Jensen-Shannon divergence can be studied:
d(Zob, ˆZm) = |Xm|D = D(ρT(b), ρE(p)) =

V. CASE STUDIES

A. Case Background and Model Bank

IEEE 33-bus Network (Fig. 2) is used to validate our
proposed hybrid framework. Considering a sampling dataset
with 1440 observations (4 hours with a 0.1 Hz sampling rate).
This observation leads to the empirical dataset Zob, which
consists of local sample data from 33 access points. Following
Sec. II-A, it is assumed that there is no prior information about
the power ﬂow on the connected branch (Pi,j and Qi,j).

Fig 4a depicts the active power generation/consumption at
each node (Pi ∈ Pob ⊂ Zob). For Node 20 and Node 31, the
curves are of high variation derived from the behavior of some
wind speed data in practice. For other nodes, however, the
curves are stationary since the proﬁle of routine power usages
is relatively smooth. It is noteworthy that we only discuss the
randomness component as mentioned in Sec. II.

(a) Preal: Load Behavior in IEEE 33-bus Network

Fig. 5: Models Stored in the Model Bank

Our previous work [32] has already shown that the ﬁxed
measurement error µE has no inﬂuence to the RMT-
based analysis and indicator at all. Therefore we only need to
consider σE. Referring to [33], it is supposed that σE = 0.005
p.u.—the standard deviation of the measurement errors is
0.5%. The uncertainties caused by renewables and measure-
ment errors together may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the statistical
properties of observed data, thereby disabling TI performance.
When both Zob, the observed data, and ˆZm, the SE output
of Model Mm, are known a priori, so is their difference Xm.
As the reasons given in our previous work [20], only voltage
magnitude Vm ⊂ Xm is discussed. Furthermore, we keep each
observation duration 720 sampling points and thus divide the
whole observation into 5 periods: T1 (1 ∼ 720), T2 (181 ∼ 900),
T3 (361 ∼ 1080), T4 (541 ∼ 1260), and T5 (721 ∼ 1440). We
use Vm(:, Tj) to represent the voltage difference on all the 33
nodes during Tj, which can be denoted as Vm j when there is
no ambiguity. Fig. 6 shows the voltage magnitude difference
in each period for Model M1: V1 1, V1 2, · · · , V1 5.

C. Regression-based TI and its Failure when Uncertainties are
not Well Addressed

We test the TI performance by employing Jacobian matrix
J (Eq. 5), a matrix variate which is strongly associated with
network topology Y. From Eq. (4), the estimation of J can
be naturally formulated as a regression problem. Under fairly
general conditions, the target J, according to Eq. (3), keeps
nearly constant within some duration, called ∆t, due to the
stability of the system, or concretely, of variables V, θ, Y .
During ∆t, considering T times observation at time instants

(b) ˆV1: Voltage Magnitude of Model 1

Fig. 4: Dataset from 33 Points and 1440 Observations

The physical grid only has numerous possible operation
models (Sec. III-C), and we arrange them to form the model
bank (Fig 5). Through parallel PF analysis, we test each model,
e.g. Model Mm, and work out its SE result ˆZm. Fig 4b depicts
the voltage magnitudes of Model M1( ˆV1 ⊂ ˆZ1).

The low-dimensional statistics Mean µ and Variation σ con-
tain enough statistical information about Gaussian variables,
but not about the renewables-derived randomness ˆV1, of which
multiple AR time-series contribute a major part. Moreover,
Mean µ is vulnerable to ﬁxed measurement error. To
address those renewables-derived uncertainties is the primary
motivation for our proposed framework.

B. Case Designing

We assume that at time point t = 720, due to some reason
there is an operation model transformation from Model M1
to M2—the system operates under M1 during 0 ∼ 720, and
M2 during 721 ∼ 1440. We also take the measurement error
into account, and regard it as a Gaussian random variable E,
whose statistical properties can be fully described by mean
µE and standard deviation σE.

the estimated values and the benchmark JMean) when there
is no error on neither y side (B in Eq 16) nor x side (A).
2. Fig. 8b and 8f tell that their performances reduce from
good level to acceptable level when some Gaussian error
(5%) injects into y (x is assumed to be error free).

3. Fig. 8c and 8g tell that when the Gaussian error (5%)
comes from both y and x, TLS becomes the only
option to reach a barely-passing result. TLS is a type of
error-in-variables regression, a least squares data modeling
technique in which observational error on both dependent
and independent variables is taken into account [35].
4. However, if the noise does not follow i.i.d. Gaussian
distribution, as the aforementioned renewables-derived
uncertainties, both OLS and TLS fail
in this kind of
regression task. These uncertainties, which are analytically
intractable under conventional framework, will almost
certainly lead to bad results without a proper treatment,
as illustrated in Fig. 8d and 8h. This is the primary
motivation for our proposed hybrid framework.

D. Elementary RMT-based Analysis

To make these renewables-derived uncertainties analytically
tractable, we have to study the problem in a high-dimensional
space. Under the RMT framework provided in our previous
work [20], we gain insight the uncertainties from the spectrum
aspect via high-dimensional analysis.

Fig. 9 depicts the analysis result for Model Mm in Period
Tj. The ‘gT’ Curve is the theoretical M-P Law spectral density
as given in Eq. (13). The ‘Hist’ Curve means histogram for
the ESD. First, we set factor numbers p in Eq. (7) to convert
difference V into residues R. Then we calculated the ESD of
Cm j = 1
T RRT according to Eq. (9). The ‘ρE’ Curve is the
probability density estimate of the ‘Hist’ Curve using Kernel
Smoothing Function (code ‘ksdensity(·)’ in Matlab, for Model
M1) or Moving Average Function (code ‘smooth(·)’, for M3).
The metric space designed in Sec. IV-E enables us to quan-
tify the TI performance of each bank model in spectrum space.
The outliers tend to big and evident as the corresponding
model becomes deviant, and the deviation will lead to a large
d(Vob, ˆVm j) = |Vm j|D as deﬁned in Eq. (14).

E. FA Analysis and Time-Series Analysis

For each difference-derived random matrix, e.g. V3 1, we
calculate its ESD with a different factor numbers p, and then
obtain the results as shown in Fig. 9d. As we increase factor
numbers p, the outliers are alleviated. This phenomenon agrees
with the fact that FA is often used for dimension reduction in
sampling data with underlying constructs, i.e. converting Vm j
into L(p)F(p) following Eq. (7). However, the residues part
Rm j could also have some latent construct. For instance,
the randomness caused by a wind following AR model with
coefﬁcients b. This statistic property cannot be eliminated
simply by increasing p. Fortunately, Ref. [27] applies RMT
to derive spectral density of large sample covariance matrices
generated by multivariate ARMA processes in analytic forms
(Eq. 8→12→11→10). Following Ref. [27], we push forwards
our research on the residues Rm j.

Fig. 6: V1: Voltage Magnitude Component of Difference X1

ti, (i = 1, 2, · · · , T, tT − t1 = ∆t), we acquire the operation
data points in the form of (x(i), y(i)).

In this case, we take the period T1 (1 ∼ 720) for study.
The truth-value of J on each sampling point is calculated
via Eq. (3) in a model-based way. The result validates that
J indeed keeps nearly constant at around its mean JMean
(Fig. 7a, 20 level), and with the standard deviation JSD
(Fig. 7b, 0.04 level). Therefore, it is reasonable to set JMean
as the benchmark during this observation period T1.

(a) Mean: JMean

(b) Standard Deviation : JSD

Fig. 7: Basic Statistical Information of J in Period T1

Deﬁning ∆x(k) (cid:44) x(k+1) −x(k) and ∆y(k) (cid:44) y(k+1) −y(k),
Eq. (4) is rewritten as ∆y(k) ≈ J(k)∆x(k). Since J keeps
nearly constant during T1, the expression is reformulated as

B ≈ JA
(16)
where J ∈ RK×K, B = (cid:2)∆y(1), · · · , ∆y(T )(cid:3) ∈ RK×T , and
A = (cid:2)∆x(1), · · · , ∆x(T )(cid:3) ∈ RK×T .

The least square method is the ﬁrst and most obvious
choice as the solution to the regression problem formulated
as Eq. (16). It is capable of handling the scenarios where the
network topologies Y are unreliable or even totally unavail-
able, and thus, Y are no longer essential information. This
property agrees with our assumption in Sec. II-A. Conversely,
the result of J estimation inherently contains the most up-to-
date information about Y.

In particular, ordinary least square (OLS) and total least
square (TLS) [34] are tested, and numerous scenarios with
different types of noise are studied. Fig. 8 shows the results.

Fig. 9: ESD of Cm j for Model m in Period Tj

Temporal analysis is conducted ﬁrst by estimating the auto-
correlation coefﬁcient b of Rm j using Burg’s method (code
‘arburg(·)’ in Matlab). If the picked model perfectly matches
the real grid, the renewables-derived auto-correlation would be
eliminated, and only (Gaussian) measurement error remains.
Fig. 10 validates this—all the node on V1 1 (Column C1) and
V2 5 (C10) are of small auto-correlation (ˆb ≈ 0), and therefore
we should accept the hypothesis that Model M1 matches the
real system in Period T1, and M2 in Period T5.

Fig. 10: Estimated auto-correlation coefﬁcient ˆb of Vm j

Fig. 9a also depicts the phenomenon that only measurement
error remains—V1 1-derived ESD does closely match the
theoretical ‘gT’ Curve (M-P Law) and no obvious outliers
exist. Besides, we can ﬁnd that the values of the nodes close
to the reference bus (e.g. Node 2, 3, 19) are usually stable
around 0. The phenomenon that these nodes are insusceptible
to renewables is consistent with our common sense.

F. Jointly Temporal-spatial Analysis with Latent Structure

M-P Law can nicely model R1 1 in some sense. Then some
open questions are raised, for example: 1) How to model other
columns, e.g., Column 11 (R3 1)? 2) Can we extract some
information from them, and how? To address these questions,
jointly temporal-spatial analysis is discussed.

may decide/inﬂuence the statistical properties of Rm j. One
major cause is the two independent renewables on Node 20
and Node 31. From the local ﬁeld data we know that their
power outputs follow AR process with some latent structure.
Another major cause is the inherent topology Y, although it is
unknown and may have a transformation at some time point.
Then we conduct the analysis with the data from a few
nodes but not all of them. This is practical when the advanced
sensors such as µPMUs are only deployed on some important
buses. RMT-framework inherently supports statistical analy-
sis with data only from a subset of nodes—the data matrix
can be naturally divided into data blocks without additional
error, but this is not true for mechanism models. Our previous
work [32] gives a discussion on this RMT-framework property.
For Column 11 (R3 1), we take the renewables-inﬂuenced
nodes’ data (b ≈ 0.9) into account, and then make a jointly
temporal-space analysis following Sec. IV. The coefﬁcients ˆb
of these inﬂuenced nodes are similar. With the prior knowledge
of Model M3 stored in the bank, we divide these inﬂuenced
nodes into three parts: 1) Node 6, 7; 2) Node 20∼22; and
3) Node 29∼33. Then we study their cross-correlation under
this division—the closely connected nodes must show strong
correlation, while the separated nodes show the independence.
Based on this property, we use the theoretical spectral density
ρT(b) to test them, and the results are given in Fig. 11.

G. Test with IEEE 85-bus Network

In addition, we test our framework using IEEE 85-bus radial
distribution systems. The sampling sensors, renewable gener-
ators with diverse/similar patterns are deployed as Fig. 12.

Fig. 12: IEEE 85-bus radial distribution systems

As a distribution grid usually operates in open loop, we just
test the pair switch of the normally closed branches and the
normally open branches. In particular, we test the pair switch
of the normally closed branches B11−12 (closed→open) com-
panied with the normally open branch B44−84 (open→closed)
in Model M2, and with B66−83 (open→closed) in M3, respec-
tively. The error of branch impedance is also tested—M4
tests B5−18, B9−10, B60−63, B32−40, and B35−48. Similar to
Fig. 10 and 11, Fig. 13a shows the time-series information, and
Fig. 13b shows the jointly spatial-temporal analysis results.

The results in Fig. 13 validate the hybrid framework
again. This framework is suitable to the scenarios when the
renewables-behavior dominates our observed data. For the
nodes inﬂuenced by multiple sources, such as Node 25 ∼ 32,
however,
them in practice. Under an
ideal scenario, independent component analysis (ICA) or free
component analysis (FCA) [36] may be applied to separate the
mixed signal into additive (independent)subcomponents. The
combination of ICA/FCA and our framework offers potential
for a more complex scenario.

VI. CONCLUSION

The ESD of relevant data derived from separated nodes
closely matches the theoretical density ρT(0.9). This phe-
nomenon is built upon the premise of the Assumption I in
Sec. IV-D, i.e. ˆR has sufﬁciently negligible cross-correlation:
cross-covariances matrix AN ≈ IN ×N —the randomness com-
ponent of these separated nodes are inﬂuenced by renewables
with independent behaviors. This independence is often
reasonable especially for an integrated energy system (IES)
with diverse sources. While for those closely connected nodes
(Node 20∼22 in this case), the independence condition is
violated, so there is no consistency between ρE and ρT(0.9).

This paper explores several high-dimensional analytics in
the context of topology identiﬁcation. We propose a hybrid
framework, by tying AR model, FA, and RMT together, to
handle the renewables-derived uncertainties in the form of
multiple time-series. Our framework, through a systematic
and theoretical processing, makes these uncertainties analyt-
ically tractable, and is immune to ﬁxed measurement error.
Several future studies are in order. Clearly, further research
is needed to employ the more general residue modeling, for
which we can calculate the spectral density readily. For ex-
ample, as described in [27], if considering vector ARMA(1,1)

processes, we have up to 6th-order polynomial equations. Ob-
viously, compared to i.i.d. Gaussian noise, the joint temporal
model (AR) and spatial model (FA) oftentimes provide more
ﬂexible and rigours models and analyses on renewables-
derived uncertainties. Besides, the framework is capable to
handle comprehensive behavior (on the nodes inﬂuenced by
multiple sources) with the help of existing algorithm such as
ICA. The combination of conventional tasks in power system
with novel tools in data science is a long-term goal in our
community, especially in big data era. In addition, this hybrid
framework can be extended to an integrated energy system, in
