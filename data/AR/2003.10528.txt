Abstract

With the uptake of targeted therapies, instead of the “one-ﬁts-all” approach, modern ran-

domized clinical trials (RCTs) often aim to develop treatments that target a subgroup of pa-

tients. Motivated by analyzing the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) data, a large RCT

to study the eﬃcacy of nutritional supplements in delaying the progression of an eye disease,

age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we develop a simultaneous inference procedure to

identify and infer subgroups with diﬀerential treatment eﬃcacy in RCTs with survival outcome.

Speciﬁcally, we formulate the multiple testing problem through contrasts and construct their

simultaneous conﬁdence intervals, which control both within- and across- marker multiplicity

appropriately. Realistic simulations are conducted using real genotype data to evaluate the

method performance under various scenarios. The method is then applied to AREDS to assess

the eﬃcacy of antioxidants and zinc combination in delaying AMD progression. Multiple gene

regions including ESRRB-VASH1 on chromosome 14 have been identiﬁed with subgroups show-

ing diﬀerential eﬃcacy. We further validate our ﬁndings in an independent subsequent RCT,

AREDS2, by discovering consistent diﬀerential treatment responses in the targeted and non-

targeted subgroups been identiﬁed from AREDS. This simultaneous inference approach provides

a step forward to conﬁdently identify and infer subgroups in modern drug development.

INTRODUCTION

With rapid advances in the understanding of human diseases, the paradigm of medicine shifts

from “one-ﬁts-all to “targeted therapies or “precision medicine”. One aspect of precision medicine

research is to develop new therapies that target a subgroup of patients. The subgroups are usually

deﬁned by “markers”, where the markers could be genotype information (such as mutation of a

certain gene), expression level of certain protein(s), disease severity or any biologically plausible

factors. For example, the KRAS status of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is associated

with the progression free survival when treated by panitumumab monotherapy (Amado et al.,

2008), and the vemurafenib (Zelboraf) was approved for treating the BRAF -mutated metastatic

melanoma (Bollag et al., 2012). For another example, multiple genetic variations including F CER2

have been reported to be associated with the drug response among asthma patients using inhaled

corticosteroids (Garca-Menaya et al., 2019).

The drug development process typically involves comparing a new treatment (Rx) with a control

(C, such as a standard-of-care) through randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and treatment eﬃcacy

is the “relative” eﬀect between Rx and C. Finding the subgroups of patients that exhibit enhanced

treatment eﬃcacy is a problem at the heart of modern drug development. To conﬁdently identify

subgroups, it is often necessary to infer treatment eﬃcacy in each group and some combination

of groups. For example, for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that separates patients into

three groups (denoted by AA, Aa and aa), one may have to decide whether the new treatment

should target a single group (e.g., aa) or a combination of groups (e.g., {Aa, aa}). In this case,

the treatment eﬃcacy in both single genetic groups and their combinations need to be assessed.

As shown by Lin et al. (2019), when population is a mixture of subgroups with heterogeneous

eﬃcacy, the eﬃcacy measure needs to respect the logic relationship among subgroups and their

combinations. Take the SNP case as an example, if the treatment eﬃcacy for Aa is x, and for aa is

y, then the eﬃcacy for {Aa, aa} should be within [x, y] (assuming x ≤ y). This may sound trivial.

However, several commonly used eﬃcacy measures such as the hazard ratio (for time-to-event data)

and the odds ratio (for binary data) do not satisfy this relationship (Ding et al., 2016; Lin et al.,

2019). Note that this logic-respecting is a property of an eﬃcacy measure, not a property of the

type of data that quantiﬁes the outcome, nor a statistical model for analyzing such data.

3

Our research is highly motivated from analyzing the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)

data, a RCT to study the risk factors for the age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and assess

the eﬀect of micronutrients on delaying the progression to late AMD (Age-Related Eye Disease

Study Research Group, 1999). AMD is a polygenic and progressive neurodegenerative disease,

which is a leading cause of blindness in elderly. Patients can progress to one or both forms of late-

AMD – central geographic atrophy (GA) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The AREDS

study collected DNA samples of consenting participants and performed genome-wide genotyping

(Fritsche et al., 2016). Many genetic studies have shown that the development or the progression

of AMD is associated with various genetic risk factors (Seddon et al., 2007; Fritsche et al., 2016;

Yan et al., 2018; Sun and Ding, 2019). Speciﬁcally, in two recent genomewide association studies

for AMD progression using the AREDS data (Yan et al., 2018; Sun and Ding, 2019), where time-

to-late-AMD is the outcome, multiple variants from ARMS2-HTRA1 and CFH gene regions have

been discovered to be associated with AMD progression. Besides association analyses where no

treatment is involved, multiple research groups also investigated whether variants from these two

gene regions are associated with diﬀerential treatment responses. A recent review article by Cascella

et al. (2018) summarized the controversial ﬁndings. Research groups such as Klein et al. (2008)

and Seddon et al. (2016) reported that genetic variants from CFH and ARMS2 regions were found

to be associated with diﬀerential responses to the antioxidants plus zinc treatment. However, the

AREDS investigators reported no signiﬁcant associations between CFH and ARMS2 regions and

the nutritional supplements, when multiplicity adjustment has been taken into account . To fully

understand the eﬀects of those nutritional supplements on AMD progression and to infer whether

there are genetic subgroups with enhanced treatment eﬃcacy, a rigorous statistical procedure that

can simultaneously identify and infer subgroups for time-to-event outcome is required.

There are existing methods for detecting heterogeneous treatment eﬀects across groups for

time-to-event outcome. One simple but broadly used method is to test the treatment-by-marker

interaction in the Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) model (Cox, 1972). However, this method

cannot provide which group to target directly, nor can it provide inference on subgroup-speciﬁc

eﬃcacy. The second type of approach focuses on testing the existence of a subgroup (with an

enhanced treatment eﬀect) using either a logistic-Cox model for the response in each subgroup and

4

the latent subgroup membership (Wu et al., 2016) or a new CoxPH model including a nonparametric

component for the covariate in the control group and a subgroup-treatment-interaction eﬀect deﬁned

by a change plane (Kang et al., 2017). Similar to the interaction test, additional steps are needed

to provide inference in the targeted and non-targeted group. The third common approach utilizes

tree-based regression models, including RECursive Partition (Ciampi et al., 1995; Negassa et al.,

2005), interaction trees (Su et al., 2008), SIDES (Lipkovich et al., 2011), GUIDE (Loh et al.,

2015) and etc. One appealing feature of using these methods is that it can provide the tree

structure which incorporates multiple covariates at the same time. However, none of these methods

provides inference for treatment eﬃcacy in both targeted group and non-targeted group, and some

approaches use illogical eﬃcacy measures. The targeted treatment development process involves

the co-development of a drug compound and a companion diagnostic tool that identiﬁes the suitable

subgroup of patients for the drug to target. Therefore, the subgroup has to be “simple” (usually

deﬁned by one or two biomarkers) for clinical and regulatory feasibility. In this article, we develop a

multiple-testing-based approach which aims to simultaneous identify and infer “simple” subgroups

with enhanced treatment eﬃcacy.

The article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the logic-respecting eﬃcacy measure for

time-to-event outcomes that we choose to use and its associated properties, and with that eﬃcacy

measure how we formulate the contrasts to identify subgroups and adjust for the multiplicity.

Section 3 presents simulations to show ﬁnite sample performance of the proposed method and uses

realistic simulations to summarize practical rules for the use of the method. Then we apply our

method on the Age-related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) data and present our ﬁndings in Section

4. Finally, we discuss and conclude in Section 5.

2. METHODS

In this article, we deal with ordinal categorical markers which separate the population into a few

groups (e.g., three groups by a SNP, or four groups by the immunohistochemistry test). Below we

use the scenario of “three-category” marker (M = 0, 1, 2) to illustrate our method. Brief discussions

are provided in Section 5 regarding how to generalize the method to handle markers with more

categories or continuous markers.

2.1

Issues with hazard ratio

First, we demonstrate why the commonly used HR is not a suitable eﬃcacy measure when the

population is a mixture of subgroups. Let HR0, HR1, HR2 denote the hazard ratio for each subgroup

deﬁned by M , and let HR01 denote the HR for the {M = 0, 1} combined. HR is not logic-respecting

in the sense that even if both HR0 and HR1 are constant, the combined population typically does

not have a constant HR. In fact, the HR of the mixture population is usually a complex function

of time, with values at some time points outside of [HR0, HR1]. This is because HR01 can not

be expressed as a weighted combination of HR0 and HR1. The combination can only be made on

density or cumulative density functions, not on the hazard ratio scale. For example, we can generate

data from a Weibull distribution where HR0 = HR1 = exp(−0.2) = 0.82, with an equal prevalence

of the two subgroups. However, the true HR01 is a smooth function of time and goes above 0.82

when t is large. In this case, it is possible that another subpopulation has HR2 = 0.84 and then at

some large time (e.g., t > 1.1), HR0 = HR1(= 0.82) < HR2(= 0.84) < HR01(= 0.85) < 1, meaning

{M = 2} exhibits more eﬃcacy than {M = 0, 1} combined, but does not exhibit more eﬃcacy

than either {M = 0} or {M = 1}. Thus using HR as the eﬃcacy measure can lead to paradoxical

ﬁndings in patient targeting.

2.2 Ratio of quantile survival times and its property

Realizing that HR is not suitable to use in the presence of mixture population, a diﬀerent measure

needs to be considered. Ding et al. (2016) demonstrated that the ratio or diﬀerence of mean or

median survival times (between Rx and C) is logic-respecting by guaranteeing µ0 ≤ µ01 ≤ µ1,

where µ denotes the eﬃcacy measure.

In this manuscript, we choose ratio of quantile survival

times as our eﬃcacy measure and demonstrate that it has a unique property under the CoxPH

model that we consider. Assume the time-to-event data ﬁt the following model:

h(t|T rt, M, X) = h0(t){β1I(T rt = 1) + β2I(M = 1) + β3I(M = 2) +

β4I(T rt = 1) × I(M = 1) + β5I(T rt = 1) × I(M = 2) + β6X},

(1)

where T rt = 0 (C) or 1 (Rx) is the treatment assignment, M = 0, 1, or 2 is the marker we

consider for testing, and h0(t) = h(t|C, M = 0, X = 0) is the hazard function for the {M = 0}

6

group receiving C, with additional covariates set to 0. Further we assume that the baseline survival

function is from a Weibull distribution with scale λ and shape k, which corresponds to h0(t) =
h(t|C, M = 0, X = 0) = ktk−1

M,τ the corresponding quantile (τ ) survival time in
each marker-by-treatment group. Let θl = eβl, l = 1, . . . , 5 and θ6 = eβ6X with βs from (1), then by

λk . Denote by νT rt

setting the survival function for each group equal to τ , the corresponding survival and their ratios

can be directly calculated as follows:

νRx

It can be seen that the quantile survival time for each group depends on the baseline character-

istics (θ6), but the ratio does not. We name it as the covariate invariant property. This property

is unique to this eﬃcacy measure, which is attractive as it makes the comparison (between Rx and

C) simple. Further it can be shown that this property also holds in the combined groups. For

example, suppose we are interested in the ratio of quantile survival times in the mixture population

of {M = 0, 1} (denoted as rτ

01). We can calculate rτ

01 from its deﬁnition, rτ

with p0 representing the prevalence of M = 0 in the combined population {0, 1}. By combining

the two groups at the probability level, this calculation follows the subgroup mixable estimation

(SME) principle (Ding et al., 2016). Let xRx

also have the covariate-invariant property for rτ

01.

2.3 Conﬁdent Eﬀect 4 contrasts (CE4) for ratio of quantile survival times

In targeted therapy development, researchers are interested in (1) whether there exists a subgroup

with enhanced treatment eﬃcacy and (2) the treatment eﬃcacy in both targeted and non-targeted

subgroups (for appropriate drug labeling) (Lin et al., 2019). To answer both questions simultane-

ously, we propose to use contrasts to compare eﬃcacy between diﬀerent subgroups and combination

of subgroups. Under the same scenario with three groups deﬁned by a marker (M = 0, 1, or 2),

in order to get a complete ordering of the treatment eﬃcacy in all possible groups, we propose the

following four contrasts:

log κ(1,2):0 = log(

r12
r0
r2
r01

) = log r12 − log r0,

log κ1:0 = log(

) = log r1 − log r0,

log κ2:(0,1) = log(

) = log r2 − log r01,

log κ2:1 = log(

) = log r2 − log r1.

(3)

r1
r0
r2
r1

We drop τ in the notation as τ is pre-speciﬁed. Moreover, these contrasts are built on the log

scale of the eﬃcacy measure since previous experience demonstrates the normality approximation

seems to work better on the log scale (as compared to the original scale) (Ding et al., 2016). In

fact these four contrasts are analogous to the contrasts proposed in Ding et al. (2018) where the

eﬃcacy in their case is measured by a continuous outcome. As pointed by Ding et al. (2018), they

are equivalent to testing the following eight one-sided null hypotheses where each one is to test an

inequality against its complement (i.e., H0 : κ(1,2):0 ≤ 1 vs Ha : κ(1,2):0 > 1) rather than testing a

zero null (such as H0 : κ(1,2):0 = 1).

H ≤

(1,2):0 : κ(1,2):0 ≤ 1, H ≤
2:(0,1) : κ2:(0,1) ≤ 1, H ≤

(0,1):2 : κ(0,1):2 ≤ 1, H ≤
0:(1,2) : κ0:(1,2) ≤ 1, H ≤

H ≤

1:0 : κ1:0 ≤ 1, H ≤

1:2 : κ1:2 ≤ 1

2:1 : κ2:1 ≤ 1, H ≤

0:1 : κ0:1 ≤ 1.

From these eight one-sided tests, we are able to tell which subgroup or combination of subgroups

exhibits a diﬀerential eﬃcacy than its complementary group.

We propose to use simultaneous conﬁdence intervals on these four contrasts so that we can

identify diﬀerential subgroup(s) and infer their eﬃcacy simultaneously. Note that level 100(1 − α)%

simultaneous conﬁdence intervals for those contrasts eﬀectively form a level-α interaction test: reject

8

the null hypothesis of no interaction between Treatment eﬀect (T rt) and marker group (M ) if at

least one of the conﬁdence intervals does not contain zero. Moreover, this formulation of assessing

“interaction” eﬀect is advantageous toward patient targeting as it allows decision-making based

on clinically meaningful diﬀerences (reﬂected from conﬁdence intervals on eﬃcacy comparisons)

instead of a mere statistical signiﬁcance (such as the p-value from the typical interaction test). To

estimate the four contrasts from (3) under our model (1), we propose the following three steps and

name this approach as “CE4-Weibull”:

- Step 1. Estimate all the parameters in the Weibull model (e.g., λ, k, βl, l = 1, . . . , 6).

- Step 2. Estimate the quantile survival times νT rt

0,τ , νT rt

1,τ , νT rt

2,τ , νT rt

01,τ , νT rt

12,τ , T rt = Rx or C, based

on the parameter estimates obtained in Step 1 and their associated variance covariance matrix.

- Step 3. Estimate r0, r1, r2, r01 and r12 and their variance covariance using estimators obtained

from Step 2 and then calculate the four contrasts CE4.

The estimated variance covariance matrices in Step 2 and Step 3 can be obtained using the Delta

method. Note that in Step 2, the Delta method for implicitly deﬁned random variables (Benichou

and Gail, 1989) needs to be applied since the quantile survival times in the combined groups (e.g.,

{0, 1} and {1, 2}) are not explicitly deﬁned, but rather from solving equations like (2).

The estimated CE4 will asymptotically follow a multivariate normal distribution and the simul-

taneous conﬁdence intervals can be then derived as follows. We compute the quantile q such that

the four simultaneous conﬁdence intervals

log(ˆκg) − qˆsgg < log(κg) < log(ˆκg) + qˆsgg, g = {(1, 2) : 0, 2 : (0, 1), 1 : 0, 2 : 1}

have a coverage probability 1 − α, that is, the joint probability

P r

(cid:16) | ˆlog(κg) − log(κg)|
ˆsgg

< q, g = {(1, 2) : 0, 2 : (0, 1), 1 : 0, 2 : 1}

(cid:17)

= 1 − α,

where ˆs2

gg is the variance estimator for log(ˆκg). The R package {mvtnorm} can be used to obtain

this q value. Then the p-value (from testing the eight one-sided null hypotheses simultaneously) can

be obtained from the multivariate normal distribution as well, which corresponds to the smallest

9

p-values from the four single contrasts. If any of the four contrasts does not cover 0, it suggests

that there exists subgroup(s) with diﬀerential treatment eﬃcacy.

2.4 Multiplicity adjustment across biomarkers

In targeted treatment development, typically a large collection of markers need to be tested in

order to identify subgroups. Therefore, there are two families of inferences need to be considered:

within a marker and across markers. Speciﬁcally, strong control of familywise error rate (FWER)

for inference within a marker is desired, since the consequence of an incorrect inference may target

a wrong subgroup, which is serious. The simultaneous conﬁdence intervals obtained from our CE4-

Weibull method appropriately controls the within-marker FWER. While the error rate for inference

across multiple markers can be controlled less stringently, since multiple candidate markers can be

identiﬁed for tailoring (which may indicate largely overlapped subgroups to target), and therefore

the perf amily error rate seems acceptable.

Suppose there are a total of K markers to be tested. Denote by Vk the number of conﬁdence

intervals that fail to cover the true values for the kth marker. Then the FWER for the kth SNP

is αk = P {Vk > 0} = E[I{Vk>0}]. For inference across SNPs, denote by V∗ the number of markers

that have at least one of its conﬁdence intervals failing to cover its true value. Then the perf amily

error rate is E[V∗] = E

(cid:20) K

(cid:21)

I{Vk>0}

=

(cid:80)
k=1

P {Vk > 0} =

αk. We suggest to use the simple

additive adjustment as proposed by Ding et al. (2018), of which by setting the desired perf amily

error rate as m (a pre-speciﬁed positive integer), the familywise αk for each marker is then set to

be m

K (same across all markers).

When SNPs are the biomarkers to deﬁne subgroups, the screening process seems similar to a

genome-wide association study (GWAS). However, our proposal controls for perf amily error rate

instead of the commonly used false discovery rate (FDR). In GWAS, it is plausible biologically that

the vast majority of the SNPs are not associated with the speciﬁc disease. However, when treat-

ments are involved, the biological processes become more complex, and zero-nulls of no-diﬀerence

(e.g., phrased as H0 : κ(1,2):0 = 1) are statistically false, which was ﬁrst observed in the setting of

Ding et al. (2018), where the treatment eﬃcacy was simulated based on a single causal SNP with

no random error being added. It was found that practically all other SNPs would appear “associ-

ated” with the outcome (as sample size reaches inﬁnity) when analyzed in a SNP-by-SNP fashion.

10

The reason is that most SNPs are not “orthogonal” to each other, and thus any SNP will appear

somewhat associated with treatment outcome as long as the distribution for proportions of being

{AA, Aa, aa} in this SNP and the causal SNP are not independent, which is most of the cases.

When there are no zero-nulls statistically, the “false” discovery seems lame, and the perf amily

rate is preferred by providing more meaningful candidates. We have more discussions about the

zero-null issue in Section 3.

3.1 Single SNP simulations

3. REALISTIC SIMULATIONS

We use SNPs as the biomarkers in all simulation studies. First, simulation studies based on a sin-

gle SNP were conducted to investigate the ﬁnite sample performance of the proposed CE4-Weibull

method. We considered three scenarios: (1) No SNP eﬀect, i.e., Rx is not eﬃcacious for any

genotype group; (2) The allele a has a dominant beneﬁcial eﬀect on Rx ; (3) The allele a has a

recessive beneﬁcial eﬀect on Rx. The SNP was simulated from a multinomial distribution with

(Paa = 0.16, PAa = 0.48, PAA = 0.36) (corresponding to minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.4).

Survival times were simulated from model (1) with scale λ = 2 and shape k = 1.25. The param-

eters (β1, β2, β3, β4, β5, β6) were set to be (0, −0.8, −0.8, 0, 0, 0), (0, −0.8, −0.8, −0.6, −0.6, 0) and

(0, −0.8, −0.8, 0, −0.6, 0) for the three scenarios respectively. The censoring times were generated

from an independent uniform distribution U (a, b) with a and b chosen to yield 20% and 50% censor-

ing rates. We chose the quantile τ as 0.5 which corresponds to the median survival. The true values

of the CE4 contrasts (κ(1,2):0, κ2:(0,1), κ1:0, κ2:1) using the ratio of median survival as the eﬃcacy

measure for each scenario are: (1) (1, 1, 1, 1), (2) (1.62, 1.27, 1.62, 1), and (3) (1.12, 1.62, 1, 1.62).

We ran 1000 simulations for each scenario, with sample size 500 for each treatment arm and the

results are summarized in Figure 1. Across all the scenarios, the biases of the CE4 estimates are

minimal and the coverage probabilities for the simultaneous conﬁdence intervals (SCP) are all close

to 95%. Larger variations are observed in biases of ˆκ2:(0,1) and ˆκ2:1, especially under scenario 3.

This is because under the recessive eﬀect setting, Rx is only eﬃcacious in {aa} patients, which is a

small proportion of the total population (16%). Therefore, the contrasts involving the comparison

between aa and other group (or the combination of other groups) have larger variances.

3.2 Realistic simulations

To understand the performance of the proposed CE4-Weibull method in the real genetic setting

with a large number of SNPs, we used the chromosome-wide data from AREDS. Among those

(> 2700) participants who had DNA collected and genotyped, we randomly selected 1000 Cau-

casian participants and randomly “assigned” them in a 1:1 ratio to the new treatment Rx and a

standard care C. Since AMD is known as a polygenic disorder and many studies have discovered

or conﬁrmed genetic risk variants associated with AMD, in this realistic simulation, we selected

a variant rs2284665 from the well-known AMD risk gene region ARM S2 on Chromosome 10 as

the causal SNP, and assumed the minor allele of this variant has a dominant beneﬁcial eﬀect

on Rx. We kept the three genotype groups (deﬁned by the causal SNP) balanced between Rx

and C. Similar as in the single SNP simulations, the progression times were simulated from the

Weibull model with λ = 2 and k = 1.25. The parameters for (β1, β2, β3, β4, β5, β6) were set to

be (0, −0.5, −0.5, −0.8, −0.8, 0), corresponding to (κ(1,2):0, κ2:(0,1), κ1:0, κ2:1) = (1.90, 1.51, 1.90, 1).

The censoring rate was set to be 25%. Therefore, the SNP data were real (from real subjects) and

the progression times and SNP eﬀects were simulated.

We analyzed chromosome 10 using our CE4-Weibull model and ﬁltered the SNPs with less

than three patients in each genotype group within each treatment arm, which resulted in a total

of 268,053 SNPs. We set m = 10, allowing on average 10 out of ∼ 270,000 SNPs with at least

one conﬁdence interval failing to cover its true value, which is equivalent to setting the αK level at

3.73 × 10−5 (= m

K = 10

268,053 ). A total of 37 SNPs were identiﬁed by CE4-Weibull. Among those 37

SNPs, 30 of them are from the ARMS2-HTRA1 region, including the causal SNP. Other seven SNPs

belong to six diﬀerent gene regions, which are distance away from the causal gene region. Figure

2A plotted the positions of these SNPs relative to the causal SNP, with y-axis (− log10(p.CE4))

showing the signiﬁcance level of each SNP. Figure 2B plotted MaxEﬀ vs − log10(p.CE4), where

MaxEﬀ (maximal eﬀect) is deﬁned as the maximum absolute value among the estimated CE4

contrasts that do not cover zero. The causal SNP has the smallest p-value (= 8.52 × 10−10) and

with MaxEﬀ of 2.20. Note that some top SNPs have very large MaxEﬀ values. For example, SNP

rs10857454 from the C10orf128-C10orf71-AS1 region has the largest MaxEﬀ of 29.7, while its p-

value is relatively large (= 3.21 × 10−6, close to the threshold). We caution against the situation

13

when a huge eﬀect size is seen, since such a huge eﬀect for treatment eﬃcacy is clinically unlikely.

For this speciﬁc SNP, it is not surprising to see the corresponding conﬁdence interval for κ2:(0,1) is

very wide and the eﬀective patient population only consists 1.5% of the total population.

To further investigate the relationship between the top SNPs and the causal SNP, we proposed

a novel SNP cross-talk plot. It is based on a ternary diagram using barycentric coordinates to

display the proportion of three variables that sum to one. Speciﬁcally, we projected the percentages

of the AA, Aa, and aa categories of the causal SNP rs2284665 in each of these categories of a given

top SNP onto the triangular diagram, and connect the points with lines.

If the SNP is highly

correlated with the causal SNP in terms of the distribution of AA, Aa, and aa, the percentages

will be close to (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1), and thus the connected line segments will be long and

lie closely to the two edges of the triangle. Otherwise, the three dots will be close to each other

to give a short angle. For example, in Figure 2C, the causal SNP has a perfect match in terms

of the percentages with itself so the three points are the vertexes of the triangle, which makes the

connected line segment coincide with the edges AA − Aa and Aa − aa (denoted by the dashed

lines). From the plot, all 30 SNPs from ARMS2-HTRA1 region are highly correlated with the

causal SNP, indicated by the long red line segments, which explains why they have been identiﬁed

by CE4-Weibull. For the 7 SNPs from other regions, their line segments are all short, indicating

they might have been identiﬁed due to randomness. Then we repeated this chromosome-wide

realistic simulation for 100 times.

3.3 Results from 100 realistic simulations

In these 100 repeated runs, the SNP data are all the same but the progression times and censoring

times are diﬀerent due to randomness from the model. By setting m = 10, on average there are

61 SNPs identiﬁed per run with a total of 3292 SNPs being picked at least once. The causal SNP

were picked 90 out of 100 times and the distribution of the ranks is shown in the stem-and-leaf plot

(upper panel in Figure 3). Note that 84 out of 90 times the rank of the causal SNP was among top

30 and 52 times it was among top 10, indicating that our CE4-Weibull is robust in identifying the

true causal SNP. The lower panel in Figure 3 summarizes all the identiﬁed SNPs from all 100 runs

in terms of their relative position to the causal SNP and their frequencies of being picked up. We

found that 98.9% of the 3292 SNPs were only picked less than 5 times, which are highly likely due

to randomness. While for SNPs close to the causal SNP and located in the same ARMS2-HTRA1

gene region, the probability of being selected is much higher, among which 27 SNPs were identiﬁed

for more than 80% of the times. From this repeated chromosome-wide simulations, we conﬁrmed

that there are possibilities that some SNPs are picked by random error but the true causal SNP

and its surrounding SNPs can be identiﬁed with very high probabilities by CE4-Weibull. Moreover,

due to the existence of linkage disequilibrium among SNPs, it is very unlikely that an isolated SNP

will be the true causal SNP.

Based on the observations from our realistic simulations, we recommend the following rules

to guide the selection of “candidate” SNPs from those identiﬁed by CE4-Weibull. (1) There are

multiple SNPs (e.g.,≥ 4) being picked from the same gene region; (2) The MaxEﬀ should not be

unrealistically large; and (3) The targeted group should be a reasonable proportion (not too small

or large, e.g., 5% − 95%) of the total population.

4. APPLICATION TO AREDS DATA

4.1 Background

AREDS is a large multi-center RCT sponsored by the National Eye Institute to evaluate the eﬀect

of antioxidants and/or zinc on delaying the progression of AMD (Age-Related Eye Disease Study

Research Group, 1999). The original study includes four treatment arms: placebo, antioxidants,

zinc and the combination of antioxidants and zinc, where the last treatment then becomes the

“AREDS formula” dietary supplements which are now available in various drug stores. However, the

treatment eﬀects of the non-placebo arms on delaying the late AMD progression are not statistically

signiﬁcant (Ding et al., 2017). Among the four arms, we speciﬁcally investigated participants in the

placebo arm (C) and the combination of antioxidants and zinc treatment arm (Rx), which included

1,170 Caucasian participants with both eyes free of advanced AMD progression when entering the

study. The outcome is the time-to-late-AMD from the ﬁrst progressed eye, where late-AMD is

deﬁned as the severity score reaches 9 or above (9=GA, 10=central GA, 11=CNV, 12=central

GA and CNV). As shown in Table 1, age, sex and smoking status do not diﬀer between the two

treatment arms. However, the baseline AMD severity score is signiﬁcantly higher among patients

who were randomized to the Rx group, as compared to patients who were randomized to placebo

16

Figure 3: Upper: stem-and-Leaf plot for the distribution of the ranks of the Causal SNP; Lower:
present frequency of the identiﬁed SNPs in 100 simulations

17

(4.0 ± 2.2 vs 2.6 ± 2.1). This is as expected and is due to the randomization design: patients

free of AMD at baseline can only be randomized to the placebo or antioxidants arms, but not the

combination arm, and thus the baseline severity score needs to be adjusted in the analysis. The

overall censoring rate is about 75%, so we used τ = 0.75 as our quantile.

4.2 CE4-Weibull on AREDS

We ﬁrst evaluated the treatment eﬀect of “AREDS formula” on time-to-progression in the overall

population using a Weibull regression model, adjusting for the known risk factors including age,

smoking status, and baseline severity score. The estimated HR between Rx and C is 1.15 with

p = 0.26, and the ratio of 75th quantile progression-free time for Rx and C is 0.91 with p = 0.12. It

suggests that the combination of antioxidants and zinc does not seem to be eﬀective in slowing down

the disease progression in the overall population, which is consistent with previous ﬁndings (Ding

et al., 2017). Then we applied CE4-Weibull method to analyze all common variants (i.e., MAF ≥

0.05) across 22 autosomal chromosomes, resulting in a total of 3,837,556 SNPs. Similarly, baseline

age, smoking status and severity score were adjusted. The upper panel of Figure 4 presents the

Manhattan plot of this genome-wide CE4-Weibull analysis. By setting m = 10, a total of 46 SNPs

meet the signiﬁcance threshold of 2.61 × 10−6(= m/K). These SNPs are from nine gene regions

on seven chromosomes. Following the recommendation rule we proposed in Section 3.3, there are

three gene regions each with at least four SNPs meeting the p-value threshold and they are labeled

in the Manhattan plot: CHST3-SPOCK2 on CHR 10 (4 SNPs), ESRRB-VASH1 on CHR 14 (30

SNPs), and C19orf44-CALR3 on CHR 19 (6 SNPs). We examined the correlation between all 46

identiﬁed SNPs using the cross-talk plot and presented the result in the lower panel of Figure 4.

We picked rs147106198 (from ESRRB-VASH1 region on CHR14), which has the smallest p-value

(= 7.00×10−8) as the reference SNP. It can be seen that the other 29 SNPs from the same ESRRB-

VASH1 region are highly correlated with the top SNP rs147106198, indicated by the long edges

of the red segments. The other two gene regions, CHST3-SPOCK2 and C19orf44-CALR3 are not

highly correlated with the ESRRB-VASH1 region, although the multiple SNPs within each region

are highly dependent on each other (denoted by overlapped segments in green or blue color). In

this case, there may be more than one causal SNP that leads to the diﬀerential treatment eﬀects.

We picked the top SNP (rs147106198 on CHR14) as our candidate marker for further discus-

sion. Figure 5 demonstrates the treatment eﬀect proﬁles and simultaneous conﬁdence intervals for

rs147106198, where the eﬃcacy proﬁle may suggest a dominant beneﬁcial eﬀect of a. The CE4

simultaneous conﬁdence intervals conﬁrm that the targeted group is {Aa,aa} combined since the

conﬁdence intervals of κ(1,2):0 and κ1:0 are above the zero line. This targeted group consists about

52% of the total patients, a reasonably high proportion of the entire population. Moreover, the

estimated ratio of 75th quantile progression-free times in the targeted and non-targeted groups

(between Rx and C) can be obtained, which are 1.44 and 0.57 for {Aa,aa} and {AA}, respectively,

indicating that the combination of antioxidants and zinc treatment extends the progression time

for 44% compared to the placebo in the targeted group. The corresponding simultaneous 95%

conﬁdence intervals for treatment eﬃcacy (on the log scale) for the targeted and non-targeted pop-

ulation were also constructed and plotted in the right panel of Figure 5. Finally, the characteristics

of targeted and non-targeted population based on rs147106198 are summarized in Table 2. As

for the baseline characteristics and treatment assignment, the patients in the targeted group do

not diﬀer from the patients in the non-targeted group, indicating that the enhanced beneﬁt from

the treatment in the targeted population is plausibly due to the genetic diﬀerence rather than the

demographic or clinical diﬀerences.

To help elucidate the controversial ﬁndings regarding whether genetic polymorphisms of CFH

and ARMS2 alter the treatment eﬃcacy of AREDS formula, we closely checked 6 SNPs from

these two regions and their results are presented in Table 3. Note that rs412852, rs1061170, and

rs3766405 from CFH and rs10490924 from ARMS2-HTRA1 have been previously investigated in

Seddon et al. (2016); Vavvas et al. (2018); Assel et al. (2018). We also reported the SNPs with the

smallest CE4-based p-value from each region, which are rs7522681 and rs11200647. None of the 6

SNPs meets the signiﬁcance threshold of 2.61 × 10−6, although 3 SNPs from CFH region meet the

nominal level of 0.05. We further investigated rs412852 from CF H and it seems our CE4-Weibull

result suggests the combination group {AA, Aa} exhibiting better treatment eﬃcacy compared to

its complementary group {aa}, which is similar to the ﬁndings from Seddon et al. (2016) and Assel

et al. (2018). However, it is worthwhile to note that from our genomewide CE4 analysis, none

of these SNPs ranked top (Table 3). Therefore, with appropriate multiplicity adjustment, neither

CFH or ARMS2-HTRA1 region has SNPs showing signiﬁcant association with treatment eﬃcacy,

which is consistent with the conclusion indicated by Chew et al. (2015).

It should be noted that based on diﬀerent SNPs, the suggested targeted population may vary. In

this example, if a top SNP from CHST3-SPOCK2 on CHR 10 is considered as the biomarker (e.g.,

rs1245576), the targeted population is about 65.8% of the total population, which overlaps with

the targeted population indicated by rs147106198 by 67.1%. Our CE4-Weibull method provides

reliable and interpretable candidate targeted populations for consideration, while the ﬁnal decision

on which population to target involves many other considerations such as development of companion

diagnostics, labeling, marketing, and reimbursement.

4.3 Validation on AREDS2

AREDS2 was another independent large multi-center RCT of AMD (Chew et al., 2012). It was

designed to evaluate the eﬀect of reﬁned AREDS formulations on AMD progression, as compared

to the original AREDS formulation. Participants of AREDS2 were more severe at baseline and

the follow-up time was only about half of the AREDS’s follow-up time. Four arms were in-

cluded: AREDS formulation, AREDS formulation plus Lutein/Zeaxanthin, AREDS formulation

plus DHA/EPA, and AREDS formulation plus Lutein/Zeaxanthin and DHA/EPA. Since there is

no real placebo arm in AREDS2, we cannot apply CE4-Weibull to identify subgroups with en-

hanced eﬃcacy of AREDS formulation directly in AREDS2. Instead, we speciﬁcally investigated

the patient’s response to the same antioxidants and zinc combination treatment to check whether

we observe similar diﬀerential response patterns between the AREDS identiﬁed targeted and non-

targeted groups in AREDS2 as compared to AREDS. We used the same SNP rs147160198 to de-

termine whether a patient belongs to targeted {Aa,aa} group or non-targeted {AA} group in both

studies. Table 4 presents the patient characteristics within the targeted and non-targeted groups,

separately for AREDS and AREDS2. None of the baseline risk factors diﬀers between targeted and

non-targeted populations in each study. Between the two studies, AREDS2 patients are older and

more severe and thus are anticipated to progress faster. Figure 6 compares the progression-free

Kaplan-Meier curves between the targeted and non-targeted groups within each study. In both

studies, the targeted population shows an obvious better progression-free proﬁle than the non-

targeted population, with the log-rank test pvalue of 0.00011 and 0.013, respectively. Therefore,

we successfully validated our identiﬁed targeted group by SNP rs147160198 in AREDS2. We also

checked the subgroups indicated by reported SNPs from the CFH region, for example rs412852. In

AREDS, the two groups ({AA, Aa} vs aa) exhibit diﬀerential treatment response proﬁles (log-rank

p < 0.001). However, such diﬀerential response proﬁles were not observed in AREDS2. This further

emphasizes appropriate multiplicity adjustment is crucial for robust subgroup identiﬁcation.

4.4 Data Availability

The phenotype and genotype data of AREDS and AREDS2 are available from the online repository

5. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this work, we develop a new statistical method to conﬁdently identify and infer subgroups in

modern RCTs with time-to-event outcomes. Diﬀerent from machine learning based approaches,

our CE4-Weibull approach, derived from the fundamental multiple testing principle, provides si-

multaneous conﬁdence intervals on contrasts that directly compare the treatment eﬃcacy between

subgroups or combination of subgroups. The contrasts are built upon a logic-respecting eﬃcacy

measure, the ratio of quantile survival times (between Rx and C), which enjoys the unique covariate

invariant property in addition to its interpretation-friendly feature.

Our CE4-Weibull adjusts for multiplicity both within and across the markers.

It rigorously

combines two error rate controls, familywise error rate control within each marker, and per family

error rate control across the markers. Such error control is appropriate in a drug development pro-

cess, as it allows ﬂexibility in the exploration of multiple candidate markers, while being conﬁdent

in the patient subgroup to target from any selected marker(s). Such a novel and rigorous multiplic-

25

ity adjustment contributes to the reduction in the so-called “reproducibility crisis” in which many

discoveries in markers or eﬀective subgroups turn out to be false positive ﬁndings.

From our realistic simulation studies where the SNP data are taken from true individuals, we

recommend practically useful rules for identifying “candidate” markers. Finally, we successfully

applied our method on AREDS data to identify subgroups that exhibit enhanced treatment eﬃ-

cacy with combination of antioxidant supplements and zinc in delaying AMD progression. After

conducting the genomewide analysis using our CE4-Weibull method, three gene regions were dis-

covered to suggest subgroups with signiﬁcantly enhanced eﬃcacy: CHST3-SPOCK2 on CHR 10,

ESRRB-VASH1 on CHR 14, and C19orf44-CALR3 on CHR 19. We further validated the sub-

groups deﬁned by the top SNP rs147106198 from ESRRB-VASH1 region using the data from an

independent AREDS2 study. SanGiovanni et al. (2013) found that the estrogen related receptor

beta (ESRRB ) was (weakly) associated with CNV AMD. Wakusawa et al. (2008) ﬁrst demonstrated

the angiogenesis modulation of VASH is involved in the pathological process of AMD. Later Zeng

et al. (2012) inferred that the treatment with AREDS formulation is likely to aﬀect both angiogen-

esis and endothelial-macrophage interactions. Thus our ﬁndings provide new perspectives on the

diﬀerential treatment eﬃcacy, suggested by genetic polymorphisms for delaying AMD progression.

Although we use the SNP testing scenario to demonstrate our method, the key elements of

the method apply to broader scenarios with all kinds of markers to consider. When the marker

separates the patient population into more groups (> 3), additional contrasts need to be considered

to obtain the complete ordering of the treatment eﬃcacy, which will then be used to identify the

subgroups. The current version of our method only handles discrete markers and more work is

required to generalize it for continuous markers.

In doing that, one may borrow the idea from

Liu et al. (2016) which considers all candidate thresholds for a continuous marker when deriving

simultaneous conﬁdence intervals.
