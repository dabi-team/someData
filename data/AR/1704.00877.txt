ABSTRACT

Solar magnetic ﬁeld in ﬂare productive active region (AR) is much more complicated than
theoretical models that assume very simple magnetic ﬁeld structure. The X1.0 ﬂare, that occurred
in AR 12192 on 2014 October 25, showed complicated three-ribbons structure. To clarify the
trigger process of the ﬂare and to evaluate the applicability of a simple theoretical model, we
analyzed the data form Hinode/SOT and SDO/HMI, AIA. We investigated the spatio-temporal
correlation between the magnetic ﬁeld structures, especially the non-potentiality of the horizontal
ﬁeld, and the bright structures in the solar atmosphere. As a result, we determined that the west
side of the positive polarity, that is intruding a negative polarity region, is the location where
the ﬂare was triggered. It is due to the fact that the sign of magnetic shear in that region was
reversed to the major shear of the AR, and the signiﬁcant brightenings were observed over the
polarity inversion line (PIL) in that region before the ﬂare onset. These features were consistent
with the recently proposed ﬂare-trigger model that suggests that small Reversed Shear (RS)
magnetic disturbances can trigger solar ﬂares. Moreover, we found that the RS ﬁeld was located
slightly oﬀ the ﬂaring PIL contrary to the theoretical prediction. We discuss the possibility of
an extension of the RS model based on an extra numerical simulation. Our result suggests that
the RS ﬁeld has certain ﬂexibility for the displacement from highly sheared PIL and that the RS
ﬁeld triggers more ﬂares than we expected.

Introduction

The triggering mechanisms of solar ﬂares are
not yet completely elucidated. Many previous
studies have attempted to reveal the physics of so-
lar ﬂare occurrence using theoretical and/or obser-
vational methods (e.g. Antiochos et al. 1999; Chen
& Shibata 2000; Moore et al. 2001). Currently, the
CSHKP model (Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966;
Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976) is widely
accepted as a standard solar ﬂare model. In this
model, magnetic reconnection plays an important
role in the energy release process of the solar ﬂare,
and it is substantiated by the Yohkoh satellite
(Ogawara et al. 1992) observations. Yohkoh cap-
tured a bright cusp structure in the solar corona
with soft X-ray observations (Tsuneta et al. 1992),
and it is believed to be evidence of energy release
by magnetic reconnection (Tsuneta 1996). How-
ever, we still do not know what triggers the mag-
netic reconnection process although there are sev-
eral candidates such as emerging ﬂux (e.g. Hey-
vaerts et al. 1977; Kurokawa et al. 2002), ﬂux
cancellation (e.g. Zhang 2001; Green et al. 2011),
sunspot rotation (e.g. Louis et al. 2014), shear mo-
tion (e.g. Hagyard et al. 1984; Kusano et al. 1995),
and the reversal of shear (Kusano et al. 2004). The
quantitative conditions of each ﬂare trigger model
have not yet been clariﬁed. It might be cause our
limited capacity for ﬂare forecast.

Kusano et al. (2012) performed a new numer-
ical simulation to investigate the trigger of solar
ﬂares. They used a simple magnetic ﬁeld struc-
ture, and characterized it using two parameters:
the global magnetic shear angle θ of the active re-
gion (AR) and the azimuth φ of the small bipole
appearing on the polarity inversion line (PIL, see
Figure 1 in Kusano et al. (2012) and Bamba et al.
(2013)). They surveyed which combination of θ
and φ can trigger ﬂares, and found that two types
of structures, the Opposite Polarity (OP) and the
Reversed Shear (RS) type, are capable of trigger-
ing ﬂares. Bamba et al. (2013) performed an ob-
servational veriﬁcation of the ﬂare trigger model
proposed by Kusano et al. (2012). They analyzed
four major ﬂares observed by the Hinode satellite
(Kosugi et al. 2007), and quantitatively conﬁrmed
how the observed results of θ and φ are consistent
with Kusano et al.’s numerical simulation results.
They identiﬁed small magnetic bipoles triggering

ﬂares in ARs with relatively simple structure of
magnetic ﬁeld and the PIL. However, solar ﬂares
generally occur in complicated ARs that are very
diﬀerent from the simple structure assumed in the
simulation. Therefore, it is important to exam-
ine whether the theoretical model is applicable to
more complex ARs.

AR NOAA 12192 was the biggest sunspot re-
gion in the solar cycle 24. The AR stayed on
the solar disk through three Carrington rotations,
and it was numbered NOAA 12172 (and 12173),
12192, and 12209 in each phase. AR 12192 had
the most complicated magnetic structure includ-
ing a δ-type sunspot in which several umbra are
sharing penumbra. A major bipole extended from
east to west, and emerging ﬂux was seen in the
middle of the bipole. Six X-class ﬂares occurred
in the AR during disk passage, and these showed
clear ﬂare ribbons appearing in the central region
of the AR. Especially, the X1.0 ﬂare on 2014 Oc-
tober 25, which is the fourth X-class ﬂare in the
AR, produced three ﬂare ribbons.

Kusano et al. (2012) and Bamba et al. (2013)
have demonstrated that the small magnetic bipoles
that trigger ﬂares are located in the center of the
initial ﬂare ribbons. However, it is diﬃcult to infer
where in the AR the triggering structure is and to
reveal the physical processes for the three-ribbons
ﬂare. In this paper, we aim to clarify the X1.0 ﬂare
trigger process in AR 12192 to examine whether
the trigger model is applicable even to complicated
ARs. Moreover, it should be noted that neither
the X1.0 ﬂare nor the other X-class ﬂares in the
AR produced any coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
although it is statistically reported that 75% of
X-class ﬂares are associated with CMEs (Yashiro
et al. 2006). We also discuss why the X1.0 ﬂare
did not have associated CMEs from the point of
view of the triggering mechanism.

This paper is organized as follows. The sam-
pled data and analysis method are described in
Sections 2 and 3, respectively. The data analysis
results are shown in Section 4. The conceivable
scenarios of the X-class ﬂare and the reason why
the ﬂares in the AR did not associated with any
CMEs are discussed in Section 5. Finally, we sum-
marize the results and considerations in Section 6.

2. Data descriptions

More than 130 ﬂares, which were larger than
C1.0, occurred in the great AR 12192. Table 1
lists the X-class ﬂares that occurred in the AR.
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al.
(2012)) observed all of the ﬂares whereas Hin-
ode/SOT observed latter ﬁve. In this paper, we fo-
cused on the X1.0 ﬂare on 2014 October 25, which
was observed by both Hinode and SDO. The AR
was located at S10◦-20◦ latitude and W15◦-25◦
longitude during the ﬂare. Figure 1 shows the soft
X-ray light curve observed by GOES (1-8 ˚A and
0.5-4 ˚A). The onset time of the X1.0 ﬂare was 16:31
UT 1, and it is indicated by a blue vertical line in
Figure 1. The two C-class ﬂares (C5.1 at 15:00 UT
and C9.7 at 15:44 UT) occurred before the X1.0
ﬂare onset, and these are indicated by the green
and red vertical lines.

We analyzed SDO data from 13:00 UT to 19:00
UT on October 25. SDO observes the full disk of
the Sun (2000(cid:48)(cid:48) × 2000(cid:48)(cid:48)), and we used ﬁlter mag-
netograms taken by Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI; Schou et al. (2012)) at 6173 ˚A (Fe I
line, sample the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld), ﬁl-
tergrams taken by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA; Lemen et al. (2012)) at 1600 ˚A (continuum
and C IV line, sample upper photosphere and the
transition region), 171 ˚A (Fe IX line, sample upper
transition region and quiet corona), 131 ˚A (Fe VIII
and Fe XXI lines, sample the transition region and
ﬂaring corona), 193 ˚A (Fe XII and Fe XXIV lines,
sample the corona and hot ﬂare plasma), and 304
˚A (He II line, sample the chromosphere and the
transition region). The spatial resolution and the
cadence were 1(cid:48)(cid:48) and 45 seconds for HMI, 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) and
12 seconds for AIA (except AIA 1600 ˚A where
the cadence was 24 seconds). We investigated the
spatial and temporal correlation between the evo-
lution of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld, bright-
enings in the chromosphere, the transition region,
and the corona.

Moreover, we used vector magnetic ﬁeld data
(the Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch:SHARP)
obtained by SDO/HMI on October 25 15:00 UT to
calculate the NLFFF. We also used Hinode/SOT

satellite (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager; Lin et al. 2002) because GOES likely released
wrong times for this event.

data to perform more precise analysis of the mag-
netic ﬁeld. We used the full polarization states
(Stokes-I, Q, U, and V) at 6301.5 and 6302.5 ˚A
(Fe I line) with a sampling of 21.5 m˚A, obtained
by the Spectro-Polarimeter (SP). The SP scanned
the central part of the AR at 11:00-11:33 UT with
a 164(cid:48)(cid:48) × 164(cid:48)(cid:48) ﬁeld-of-view (FOV), and the spatial
resolution was 0.3(cid:48)(cid:48).

3. Analysis Methods

3.1. Method of SDO/HMI, AIA analysis

In this study, we basically used the analysis
method developed in Bamba et al. (2013). The
analysis method was originally developed for Hin-
ode/SOT data, but Bamba et al. (2014) already
examined the applicability of the analysis method
to the SDO data sets. Here, we brieﬂy summarize
the procedures of the analysis method.

We used HMI level 1.5 line-of-sight (LOS) mag-
netograms (hmi.M 45s series) and AIA level 1.0
data (aia.lev1 euv 12s and aia.lev1 uv 24s
series). We ﬁrst calibrated all the HMI ﬁlter
magnetograms and all the AIA images using the
aia prep procedure in the Solar Soft-Ware (SSW)
package. By this process, spatial ﬂuctuations were
reduced, and the images were rotated so that the
solar EW and NS axes are aligned with the hori-
zontal and vertical axes of the image, respectively.
Moreover, LOS magnetograms and AIA images
were resampled to the same size because the pixel
scales are diﬀerent between HMI and AIA. Thus
the positions of the LOS magnetograms and AIA
images were aligned. Next, we chose a HMI ﬁlter
magnetogram and an AIA image closest in time,
and these two images were superimposed onto
each other. We drew the PILs and the strong
emission contours in the AIA image onto the LOS
magnetogram at each time. The PILs were drawn
on the AIA images at each time, as well.

3.2. Method of Hinode/SOT analysis

The SP scan data were calibrated using the
sp prep procedure (Lites & Ichimoto 2013) in the
SSW package assuming the Milne-Eddington at-
mosphere. The inversion code MEKSY (developed
by Dr. Takaaki Yokoyama) was adopted and the
180◦ ambiguity in the vector magnetograms is re-
solved using the AZAM utility (Lites et al. 1995).
Note that the observed “LOS” and “transverse”

magnetic ﬁeld vectors (i.e., image plane magnetic
ﬁeld) converted to the heliographic magnetic ﬁeld
Bx, By, and Bz using the equation (1) of Gary &
Hagyard (1990).

(cid:113)

We investigated the distribution of the mag-
netic shear over the AR before the ﬂare onset,
using the vector magnetogram obtained from the
SP scan data. We ﬁrst calculated the potential
ﬁeld using the fff procedure in the nlfff pack-
age (developed by Dr. Yuhong Fan) in SSW.
Then we measured the angles between the po-
tential ﬁeld vector Bp and horizontal ﬁeld vector
2 in each pixel, and we deﬁned
Bh =
these angles as the relative shear angle χ. The
relative shear angles are deﬁned between ±180◦,
where 0◦ means vectors Bp and Bh are oriented in
the same direction. The direction of vector Bh de-
viates from vector Bp to counter-clockwise (clock-
wise) when the magnetic helicity is positive (neg-
ative) and the value of χ is positive (negative).
We colorized the relative shear angles as shown in
Section 4.3.

4. Results

4.1. Overview of the C5.1, C9.7 and X1.0

ﬂares in each wavelength

The temporal evolution of the brightenings and
ﬂare ribbons in AIA 1600 ˚A, which is sensitive to
the emission from upper chromosphere and the
transition region, are shown in Figure 2. We
can see the contours of those brightenings with
the magnetic ﬁeld structure in Figure 3, where
white/black indicates the positive/negative polar-
ity of the LOS magnetic ﬁeld. The green lines
and the red contours denote the PIL (line of 0 G)
and the signiﬁcant brightenings (2000 DN) in AIA
1600 ˚A, respectively. The green lines in Figure 2
are the same as these in Figure 3. The positive
polarity that is intruding the negative region N1
(henceforth IPP: intruding positive polarity) and
a weak negative region N2 are located between
the major bipole P1 and N1, as can be seen in
Figure 3(a). We can also see the small brighten-
ings B1 and B2, which are indicated by the yel-
low arrows in panels (a) of both Figures 2 and 3.
These brightenings are seen intermittently at the
west side of the IPP at 14:48-14:58 UT. The other
brightening B3 is also seen in the IPP in panels (a).

4

The ﬂare ribbons of the C5.1 ﬂare appears about
ﬁve minutes later as shown in panels (b). The
positive ribbons CR1 and CR2 are clearly seen in
the P1 and IPP regions. There are two negative
ribbons in the N1 region at a glance, but these
brightenings are connected each other in the AIA
304 ˚A image (see Figure 4(b) and latter descrip-
tion). Then we identify these brightenings in the
N1 region as the negative ribbon CR3 as seen in
Figure 2(b). The B1 and B2 disappear at the last
minute before the C5.1, while the B3 enhances as
the ﬂare ribbon CR2 in panels (b). It is inferred
that the B1 and B2 are caused by local magnetic
reconnection occurred at the west side of the IPP
before the C5.1 ﬂare onset, and that the B1 and B2
brightenings appear at the foot points of the small
magnetic loops connecting the IPP and N2. It is
also suggested that the B3 locates at a foot point
of magnetic loops that connects the IPP and N1
and that corresponds to the C5.1 ﬂare. Once the
three ribbons CR1, CR2, and CR3 of the C5.1 ﬂare
disappear by 15:15 UT, the C9.7 ﬂare ribbons ap-
pear from 15:40 UT as seen in panel (c). The C9.7
ﬂare also shows three ﬂare ribbons CR1, CR2, and
CR3 at the same location to the ribbons of the
previous C5.1 ﬂare. The three-ribbons of the C5.1
and C9.7 ﬂares almost never propagate with time.
A faint ribbon-like brightening remained at the re-
gion where the CR1 is seen even after the three rib-
bons disappeared, as seen in Figure 2(d). Panels
(e) show the initial ﬂare ribbons of the X1.0 ﬂare
that appear about one hour after the C9.7 ﬂare.
In this phase, the XR1 (positive ribbon) and the
XR2 (negative ribbon) at the west side/middle are
more clearly seen than the XR3 (negative ribbon)
at the east side. These three-ribbons slowly grow
as shown in panels (f) at 16:35-17:10 UT. Espe-
cially, XR1 and XR3 get longer in the southward
and northward directions, respectively. However,
they almost never propagate to outer side (i.e. to
the westward and eastward) with time. The XR2
disappears ﬁrst in the late phase while XR1 and
XR3 remain more than one hour after the onset.
Figure 4 shows the AIA 304 ˚A images of the
same FOV and almost the same time as Figures 2
and 3. The PILs are over plotted only in panel (a).
The intermittent brightenings B1, B2, and B3 are
indicated by the yellow arrows in panel (a), and
these are seen at the west side of the IPP as well
as shown in the AIA 1600 ˚A image of Figure 2(a).

The brightening B1 and B2 are connected each
other and it shapes a small loop striding over the
local PIL at the west side of the IPP. It is clearly
seen at 14:48-15:00 UT although it persisted from
13:00 UT to just before the onset of the C5.1 ﬂare.
It also suggests the existence of small magnetic
loops which connect the IPP and N2 in the west
side of the IPP. On the other hand, the brightening
B3 is connected with the N1 where the CR3 will
appear, as clearly seen in Figure 4(a) and (b). The
brightenings, these will be the ﬂare ribbons CR1
and CR2, are already seen from 13:00 UT, and the
CR3 also appear from 14:00 UT. The three ribbons
start to be enhanced from 14:30 UT, and these will
be the three ribbons of the C5.1 ﬂare in panel (b).
There is a ﬁlament on the PIL between P1 and
N2, and some bright points start to move along
the ﬁlament from just before the C5.1 ﬂare (from
14:58 UT). The three ribbons CR1, CR2, and CR3
remain even after C5.1 ﬂare, and the bright point
motion along the ﬁlament continues and become
intense. These bright structures ﬂow down along
the ﬁlament to the foot points in the P1 and N1 re-
gions, and then the three ribbons CR1, CR2, and
CR3 of the C9.7 ﬂare are enhanced from 15:47 UT
(see panel (c)). Note that the strong brightening,
that looks like another ﬂare ribbon between the
CR1 and CR2 in panel (c), is not a ﬂare ribbon,
but a bright point moving along the ﬁlament like
the tether-cutting reconnection (cf. Figure 6 and
latter description). The ﬂare ribbons remain more
clearly than that seen in Figure 2(c), especially the
CR1 and CR3 are clearly seen in Figure 4(d). The
remaining ribbons are enhanced and a new ﬂare
ribbon along the ﬁlament gradually appeared in
the N2 region from 16:30 UT, and it becomes XR2
as seen in panel (e). This is the X1.0 ﬂare, and
the ﬂare ribbons XR1 and XR3 are correspond-
ing to the CR1 and CR3, respectively. The CR2
also remain, but it is not seen in the AIA 1600 ˚A
images (see Figure 2(e, f)).
In the initial phase
of the X1.0 ﬂare (until 16:55 UT), ex-CR2 bright-
ening and negative ribbon XR3 are connected, as
seen in Figure 4(e). It is corresponding to the ﬁrst
peak of the X1.0 ﬂare in the GOES soft X-ray light
curve (cf. Figure 1). Then the bright bridge con-
necting ex-CR2 and XR3 become weakened, and
the XR3 get longer to the northward as seen in
panel (f). The XR1 and XR2 are also enhanced
at that time, and the post ﬂare loop connecting

XR1 and XR2 is appeared. The XR2 is weakened
ﬁrst while the XR1 and XR3 remain likewise seen
in AIA 1600 ˚A images.

The coronal loops in AIA 131 ˚A images are
shown in Figure 5, with the PILs only shown
In the early phase (panel (a)),
in panel (a).
the bright loops L1 and L2 connect IPP-N1 and
P1-N1, respectively. The IPP have continuously
emerged from October 19, and it has intruded
into the negative sunspot (N1). Therefore,
it
is suggested that strong electric current layer is
formed in between the L1/L2 and the overlay-
ing magnetic arcade which connects P1-N1 (it lo-
cates higher/outer than L2). In this layer, coro-
nal loops are heated by magnetic reconnection be-
tween L1/L2 and overlaying magnetic arcade, even
though the ﬁeld directions of magnetic loops do
not diﬀer strongly. Note that there is another faint
loop L3 as indicated in panel(a), and it might con-
nects P1-N2 (and also P1-N1). The foot points of
L1 and L2 brighten as seen in Figure 4(a). These
heated loops L1 and L2 are enhanced at the C5.1
ﬂare onset as seen in Figure 5(b). Once the inten-
sity of the coronal loops decrease at 15:15-15:35
UT, the loops L1 and L2 becosme bright again and
the three ribbons of the C9.7 ﬂare appear as indi-
cated by the yellow broken lines in panel (c). Then
the intensity of the coronal loops continuously in-
crease until the onset time of the X1.0 ﬂare (panel
(d)). The coronal loops connecting the XR1 and
XR2 enhance (panel (e)), then the XR3 appear
and the faint coronal loops connect the XR1 and
XR3 as can be seen in panel (f).

Interestingly, the tether-cutting magnetic re-
connection process (Moore et al. 2001) is clearly
seen between the C5.1 and C9.7 ﬂares. Figure 6
shows AIA 171 ˚A images with a similar FOV to
Figures 2-5. The PILs are over plotted only in
panel (a), and there is a ﬁlament as indicated
by the red arrow in panel (b). We can see the
faint loop structures which intersect at point O
and along the ﬁlament. Some small brightenings
frequently move along these faint loops as illus-
trated by the blue arrows in panel (b). These
bright structures are seen from 13:00 UT, and
these are enhanced from 15:00 UT, just before the
C5.1 ﬂare. The motion along the loops become
faster and the loops slightly expand between 15:40
and 16:00 UT (panel (c)). The ﬂare ribbons CR1
and CR3 of the C9.7 ﬂare appear at the foot points

5

of the faint loops as illustrated by red broken lines
in panel (d), and we can see the three ribbons in
the chromosphere at that time (see Figure 4(b)).
These are clearly seen in Movie 1. The similar
motion of the bright structure along the ﬁlament
is also seen in AIA 304 ˚A images from just after
It
the C5.1 ﬂare to the onset of the C9.7 ﬂare.
suggests that the tether-cutting magnetic recon-
nection occurs in the C5.1 and C9.7 ﬂares at the
point O.

The bright points B1, B2, B3, the tether-
cutting reconnection, and the bright coronal loops
connecting the XR1 and XR2 are also seen in AIA
193 ˚A images (Figure 7) with much less satura-
tion. In panel (a), the brightenings B1, B2, and
B3 are clearly seen as well as seen in AIA 1600
˚A and 304 ˚A images. The brightening B3 corre-
sponds to the positive foot point to the coronal
loop L1 that connect the IPP and N1 (cf. Fig-
ure 5(a)). The positive foot point of L2 is also
seen as a bright point in P1 region, as seen in
Figure 7(a). The tether-cutting reconnection is
also seen as panel (b), although it is more faint
than that seen in AIA 304 ˚A and 171 ˚A images.
After the tether-cutting reconnection, from 16:30
UT, the faint coronal loops rooted the XR1 and
XR2 drastically expand to the southwest ward, as
illustrated by the blue arrow in panel (c). This
expanding motion of the faint coronal loops cor-
respond to the enhancement of the coronal loops
seen in Figure 5(d-f). Then the ﬂare ribbons XR1
and XR3 are elongated to the southward and the
northward, respectively.

4.2. Locations of the C9.7 and the X1.0

ﬂare ribbons

The ﬂare ribbons of the two C-class ﬂares (the
C5.1 and C9.7 ﬂares) appear at the same location,
as we described in the previous section. There-
fore, here we compare the locations and evolution
between the C9.7 and the X1.0 ﬂare ribbons. Fig-
ure 8 shows the distribution of the C9.7 and X1.0
ﬂare ribbons. The background images are the HMI
LOS magnetograms at the onset time of the X1.0
ﬂare (16:31 UT), and the green lines indicate the
PILs. The red contour outlines the brightenings
in AIA 1600 ˚A, such as the ﬂare ribbon at 15:50
UT (just after the C9.7 ﬂare onset), in both panels
(a) and (b). The blue contours outline the bright-
enings at 16:45 UT (before the X1.0 ﬂare onset)

6

in panel (a) and at 17:06 UT (after the X1.0 ﬂare
onset) in panel (b), respectively. The initial ﬂare
ribbons of the C9.7 and X1.0 ﬂare are seen in panel
(a), and the XR1 and XR3 of the X1.0 ﬂare located
slightly to the outer side of the CR1 and CR3
of the C9.7 ﬂare. Both of the XR1, XR3, CR1,
and CR3 slightly propagate to the outer side (i.e.
to westward and eastward) with time, although
the XR1 and XR3 clearly grow to southward and
northward, as noted in Section 4.1. Therefore, it
is suggested that the C5.1, C9.7, and X1.0 ﬂares
serially occur corresponding to almost the same
magnetic structures. In other words, the X1.0 ﬂare
is an extension of the C-class ﬂares, and the X1.0
ﬂare is driven by reconnection of the magnetic ﬁeld
anchored in the outer region of the C-class ﬂare
ribbons.

4.3. Features of the magnetic ﬁelds

The vector magnetic ﬁeld in the central part
of the AR was observed by Hinode/SP between
11:00 and 11:33 UT, as shown in Figure 9.
In
panel (a), the background white/black indicates
positive/negative polarity of Bz. Green lines indi-
cate the PILs (line of Bz = 0G). The horizontal
magnetic ﬁeld vector Bh is over plotted on the
Bz map by the red arrows. The horizontal ﬁeld
is strongly sheared along the PIL located between
the P1 and N2 regions. It suggests that the ma-
jor magnetic helicity along the PIL of the AR is
negative. On the other hand, the vectors at the
west side of the IPP are locally toward northwest
stride over the PIL. It is consistent with the shape
of the small bright loop connecting B1 and B2 in
Figure 4(a). Therefore, the local magnetic ﬁeld
at the west side of the IPP has positive magnetic
helicity, which is opposite to the major magnetic
helicity along the PIL. It is more clearly seen in
panel (b), which shows the relative shear angle χ,
deﬁned as the angle between the potential ﬁeld
Bp and the horizontal ﬁeld Bh at each point. The
black lines indicate the PILs, that is the same to
the green lines in panel (a). The relative shear an-
gle χ along the ﬂaring PIL (between P1 and N2)
and that in the west side of the IPP are correspond
to the shear angle θ0 of the AR and the azimuth ϕe
of the small magnetic disturbance in Kusano et al.
(2012), respectively. Obviously, χ is around −90◦
(blue) along the PIL but χ is 90◦ (red) at the west
side of the IPP. Therefore, the distribution of the

relative shear angle χ suggests that the west side
of the IPP satisﬁed the Reversed Shear (RS) type
ﬂare trigger condition proposed by Kusano et al.
(2012). They proposed that the shear cancellation
between the global magnetic ﬁeld and the RS-type
small magnetic ﬁeld structure can trigger a ﬂare,
and signiﬁcant brightenings should be observed in
the solar atmosphere during the shear cancellation
over the RS-type structure.
In our case, signiﬁ-
cant brightenings B1 and B2 are observed at the
west side of the IPP where the magnetic shear is
reversed to the shear of the global magnetic ﬁeld
along the ﬂaring PIL. It is consistent with the the-
oretical prediction. Therefore, the west side of the
IPP could be the location where the ﬂares were
triggered in the AR.

5. Discussion

5.1. Coronal magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation

In this study, we extrapolated the magnetic
ﬁeld in the corona, and compared it to the ob-
served features. We derived the coronal magnetic
ﬁeld from vector magnetic ﬁeld data taken by HMI
at October 25 15:00 UT using the NLFFF extrap-
olation method developed by Inoue et al. (2014).
Figure 10 shows the coronal magnetic ﬁeld lines
anchor to the ﬂare ribbons of the C9.7 and the
X1.0 ﬂares. The grayscale is an HMI LOS mag-
netogram at October 25 15:00 UT. The red/blue
contour outlines the brightenings (700 DN) in AIA
1600 ˚A, such as the ﬂare ribbons observed at 15:50
UT/17:03 UT. The blue and orange tubes indicate
the coronal magnetic ﬁeld lines. The orange tubes
anchor to the ribbons of the C9.7 ﬂare (CR1, CR2,
and CR3), as shown in panels (a) and (b). On the
other hand, the sky blue tubes anchor to the three
ribbons of the X1.0 ﬂare (XR1, XR2, and XR3),
as seen in panels (c) and (d). The small magenta
tubes indicated by the magenta arrow are the lo-
cal magnetic ﬁeld lines at the west side of the IPP.
Obviously, the sky blue magnetic loops connecting
XR1 and XR3 are located at the outer edge of the
orange loops connecting CR1 and CR3. These are
consistent with the observed features that the ﬂare
ribbons of the X-class ﬂare are on the outer side
of the ribbons of the C-class ﬂares as shown in
Figure 8.

5.2. Comparison with the emerging ﬂux

model

Here, we discuss the ﬂare trigger scenario of
the consecutive C- and X-class ﬂares by compar-
ing a theoretical model proposed by Chen & Shi-
bata (2000). In this region, there are four kinds
of possible magnetic connectivity; P1-N1, IPP-N1,
IPP-N2, and P1-N2. Moreover, there is a ﬁlament
trapped by P1-N2 loops as seen in AIA images
If we focus on the con-
(Figures 4, 6, and 7).
nectivity IPP-N1 and P1-N2, the topology of the
magnetic ﬁeld is consistent with the case B of Chen
& Shibata (2000), in which the emerging ﬂux ap-
pears on the outer edge of the ﬁlament channel.
The IPP-N1 and P1-N2 has the same orientation
relative to the main ﬂaring PIL each other, and
the IPP-N1 can be considered as an ﬂux emerging
on the east edge of the ﬁlament channel P1-N2.
Magnetic reconnection of the IPP-N1 ﬂux with the
ﬂux passing over the main ﬂaring PIL (between P1
and N2) will weaken the latter ﬂux. It can desta-
bilize the current-carrying ﬂux in the core region
above the main ﬂaring PIL, and the reconnection
also produces short loops at the PIL between the
IPP-N2 and long loops connect P1-N1.

In this scenario, it is required to trigger an X-
class ﬂare that the ﬂux rope exists on the PIL and
that the ﬂux rope erupts. The former is likely be-
cause multitude of ﬂares including three X-class
ﬂares had occurred in the same PIL between P1-
N2. However, the latter is not consistent with the
observed features that the ﬁlament along the PIL
between P1-N2 does not move through the two
C-class and X-class ﬂare processes (cf. Figure 4).
It indicates that the eruption of ﬂux rope such as
required in the case B scenario is unlikely. More-
over, IPP is intruding into N1, i.e magnetic loop
connecting IPP-N1 moves away from P1-N2, in
association with emergence of IPP, as described
in Section 4.1. This motion is oppose to the sce-
nario expected in the case B of Chen & Shibata
(2000) that requires approach of IPP-N1 and P1-
N2. Therefore, the ﬂare trigger by the case B sce-
nario may be diﬃcult, although the magnetic ﬁeld
topology is consistent with the case.

5.3. Comparison with the RS-type model

As an another ﬂare trigger scenario, there is
the RS-type scenario proposed by Kusano et al.

7

(2012).
In this senario, the key structure is the
small magenta loops connecting IPP-N2, that are
indicated by the magenta arrow in Figure 10. We
found that the west side of the IPP satisﬁed the
condition of the RS-type ﬂare trigger ﬁeld based
on the distribution of the relative shear angle (cf.
Figure 9(b)). The long orange loops connecting
P1-N1 are topologically equivalent to the overly-
ing blue ﬁeld line in Figure 4(a-c) of Kusano et al.
(2012). Therefore, the following scenario is con-
ceivable.

(1) Step-1 (trigger for the C-class ﬂares): Mag-
netic shear cancellation proceeds between the IPP-
N2 (magenta) loops and the P1-N1 (orange) loops
at the west side of the IPP. The shear cancel-
ing reconnection locally heats the atmosphere and
causes chromospheric evaporation, above the west
side of the IPP. These local heating and evap-
oration are observed as the brightening B1, B2,
and B3 in AIA images (Figures 2-4). The recon-
nected ﬂuxes are transferred into the small loops
connecting IPP-N1 and P1-N2, and the magnetic
pressure above the west side of the IPP must be
decreased. The loops IPP-N1, P1-N1, and P1-
N2 are heated by the reconnection. These are
observed as bright coronal loops L1, L2, and L3
in AIA 131 ˚A (Figure 5), although the location
of the negative foot point of L3 is fuzzy. The
schematics of the magnetic ﬁeld line before and
after the step-1 reconnection are shown in Fig-
ure 11(a, b). The orange and magenta loops are
equivalent to the P1-N1 (orange loops) and IPP-
N2 (magenta loops) loops in Figure 10(a, b). The
green small loops in Figure 11(b) represent the
small loops formed by the magnetic reconnection
between the RS-type trigger ﬁeld (magenta loops)
and the overlying sheared ﬁeld (orange loops).

(2) Step-2 (reconnection of the C-class ﬂares):
The sheared loop P1-N1 collapses inward because
an inﬂow (such as studied by Ugai & Shimizu
(1996)) drags ﬂux into the region where magnetic
pressure was decreased by the step-1 reconnection,
i.e., above the west side of the IPP. Then reconnec-
tion occurs in the collapsed loops (inside the or-
ange loops connecting P1-N1 in Figures 10, 11(b)),
and it shows the three-ribbons CR1, CR2, and
CR3 of the C5.1 and C9.7 ﬂares. The reconnec-
tion is observed as the tether-cutting reconnection
in AIA 171 ˚A (Figure 6 and Movie 1) and 193 ˚A
(Figure 7) images. Note that the CR2 in the IPP

8

was the brightening B3 in the pre-ﬂare phase, and
that the brightening in the IPP represents the in-
tensive electric current layer formed by the step-1
reconnection (see Appendix).

(3) Step-3 (trigger for the X1.0 ﬂare): It is in-
ferred that the long twisted ﬂux rope connecting
P1-N1 might be formed by the tether-cutting re-
connection, as illustrated by the thick orange line
in Figure 11(c), according to Moore et al. (2001)
and Kusano et al. (2012). There are another
sheared loops (sky blue loops connecting P1-N1
and P1-N2) above the orange loops and the long
twisted ﬂux rope. The ﬂux rope gradually rise
upwards with the overlying sky blue loops, then
the magnetic ﬂuxes are transferred into upward
and magnetic pressure over the PIL between the
P1 and N1 regions is decreased. After the mag-
netic pressure is decreased suﬃciently, magnetic
reconnection between the sky blue loops occurs.
It causes the X1.0 ﬂare and produces the three-
ribbons (XR1, XR2, and XR3) at the foot points
of the sky blue loops. The reconnection might
produce further long twisted ﬂux rope connecting
P1-N1, then the ﬂare ribbons XR1 and XR3 are
elongated to the south and north as magnetic re-
connection with diﬀerent ﬁeld lines.

Therefore, the C5.1 and C9.7 ﬂares can be trig-
gered originally by the RS-type structure (the ma-
genta loops connecting the IPP-N2) at the west
side of the IPP, and the rise of the ﬂux rope
that formed by the C-class ﬂares trigger the X1.0
ﬂare, in a three-step process.
In Kusano et al.
(2012), they put a small bipole, that satisfy the
RS-type condition, just above the highly sheared
PIL. Then the shear cancellation (step-1 reconnec-
tion) between the trigger ﬁeld and the pre-existing
sheared ﬁeld occurs on the PIL. However, in the
current AR, the IPP-N2 magenta loops are not
located on the PIL between the major ﬂare rib-
bons XR1 and XR2, i.e., the ﬂare trigger ﬁeld is
located slightly oﬀ the main ﬂaring PIL. In the
Appendix, we discuss the applicability of the RS-
type scenario in the case of that the trigger ﬁeld
exist away from the main ﬂaring PIL. According
to an extra simulation, RS-type ﬁeld can work as
a trigger of the ﬂare even it is located away from
the highly sheared PIL. It is suggested that the
RS-type ﬂare trigger process has certain ﬂexibil-
ity for the distance of the ﬂare trigger ﬁeld from
the highly sheared PIL.

5.4.

Interpretation of “No CME occur-
rence”

Figure 12(a) is the side view of Figure 10(f) in
which the yellow colored surface is an isosurface
where the decay index equals to 1.5. The decay
index is deﬁned as n = −d ln | Bp,h | /d ln | z |,
where Bp,h and z are the horizontal component
of the potential magnetic ﬁeld calculated from
the observed Bz and the height, respectively (e.g.
Shafranov 1966; Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006). Obviously,
the coronal magnetic loops anchored to both the
C9.7 and the X1.0 ﬂare ribbons have not reached
the isosurface of n = 1.5, and the ﬂux tube was
stably staying because the overlying magnetic ﬁeld
above the ﬂux tube did not reach the critical de-
cay index. Therefore, the highly sheared magnetic
loops, that are related to the ﬂares, have not sat-
isﬁed a condition of the torus instability although
they satisfy the ﬂare trigger condition summarized
in Inoue et al. (2015). In other words, the closed
loops (red loops in panel (b)), that are over the
orange and the sky blue loops, might prohibit the
twisted ﬂux rope, that is created in the central
part of the AR via tether-cutting reconnection
with the C- and X-class ﬂares, from erupting (In-
oue et al. 2016).

According to Kusano et al. (2012), the causal-
ity between the ﬂux rope eruption, which may
create CMEs, and the magnetic reconnection of
ﬂares is diﬀerent between the two types of ﬂare
trigger processes. The RS-type ﬂare trigger pro-
cess is a “reconnection-induced eruption” process
where the tether-cutting reconnection of the ﬂare
is triggered before eruption of the ﬂux rope.
It
means that the RS-type ﬂare does not necessarily
cause a large ﬂux rope eruption such as a CME.
Therefore, it is also consistent that the ﬂares trig-
gered by the RS-type magnetic conﬁguration did
not have an associated CME in the AR.

6. Summary

In this study, we analyzed the X1.0 and the pre-
ceding two C-class ﬂares occurred in AR NOAA
12192. We aimed to clarify the triggering pro-
cess and to evaluate applicability of a ﬂare trigger
model such as proposed by Kusano et al. (2012).
We analyzed the ﬁlter and vector magnetograms
by Hinode/SOT and SDO/HMI, and also used the
ﬁltergrams for each layer of the solar atmosphere

9

by SDO/AIA. We found that there was a char-
acteristic magnetic ﬁeld structure that is the pos-
itive polarity intruding to the following negative
sunspot (we named the structure “the intruding
positive polarity (IPP)”). The signiﬁcant chromo-
spheric brightenings and the coronal loops were
also observed around the IPP before the onset of
the ﬂares. The relative shear angle χ, that is de-
ﬁned as the angle between the potential ﬁeld vec-
tor and the transverse ﬁeld vectors, was measured
in the AR. These observed features were consis-
tent with the RS-type ﬂare trigger ﬁeld of the
KB12 model. We considered the ﬂare trigger sce-
nario from the coronal magnetic loops that were
extrapolated by the NLFFF method. The trig-
gering process of the ﬂares was more consistent
with the RS-type of the KB12 model rather than
the case B of Chen & Shibata (2000), because the
former does not require epic eruption of ﬂux rope
trigger ﬂare. Therefore, we concluded that the RS-
type of the KB12 model is more suitable for the
triggering process of the C-class ﬂares, and that
the X1.0 ﬂare was caused by rise of the ﬂux rope
that formed by the preceding C-class ﬂares, in a
three-step process.

In the AR, the RS-type ﬁeld was located
slightly oﬀ the main ﬂaring PIL whereas the orig-
inal RS-type simulation. According to an extra
simulation with an oﬀset of the RS-type ﬁeld from
the highly sheared PIL (see the Appendix), it is
suggested that the RS-type ﬂare trigger process
has certain ﬂexibility for the distance of the ﬂare
trigger ﬁeld from the highly sheared PIL. How-
ever, it is still unclear how a distant ﬁeld that is
away from the PIL can trigger ﬂares on the actual
solar surface. We need to statistically investigate
the distance between the ﬂaring PILs and the ﬂare
trigger ﬁelds using observational data.

We also discussed the causality between these
ﬂares and CMEs by considering the critical height
of the onset of the torus instability. The closed
magnetic ﬁeld overlying a ﬂux rope, which might
be created by tether-cutting reconnection between
the highly sheared loops, had not reached the criti-
cal decay index, and it might prohibit the ﬂux rope
from erupting. In addition, this was also consis-
tent with our conclusion that the C5.1, C9.7, and
X1.0 ﬂares were triggered by the RS-type ﬁeld,
which might cause reconnection without the help
of eruptive instabilities such as the torus instabil-

ity. This suggests that the magnetic reconnection
might not developed substantially, and that the
ﬂux rope did not reach a condition of the torus
instability.

In the AR 12192, more ﬁve X-class ﬂares oc-
curred with the growth of the positive polarity,
that is intruding to the following negative po-
larity region. These X-class ﬂares showed clear
two-ribbon structures at similar locations, and all
the X-class ﬂares also did not associated with any
CMEs. We suggest that the west side of the IPP
could be a trigger of these X-class ﬂares although
we need the detailed analysis for the each ﬂare
events. Sun et al. (2015) reported that the electric
current along the ﬂaring PIL was very low, and
horizontal magnetic ﬁeld decreased much slower
with height, before the X3.1 ﬂare on October 24
(∼ 20 hours before the X1.0 ﬂare). Thalmann
et al. (2015) using global magnetic ﬁeld modeling
also pointed out that the strong closed arcade over
the highly sheared arcades contributed to the con-
ﬁnement of the ﬂux rope, for several M-class and
X-class ﬂares that occurred in AR 12192. There-
fore, a similar magnetic conﬁguration might be
kept during the AR disk passage, and it is im-
portant to investigate the temporal evolution of
the characteristic magnetic structures in order to
clarify the conditions of these “consecutive” and
“conﬁned” ﬂares. The combination of Hinode and
SDO observations and NLFFF extrapolations is a
powerful tool for analyzing local and global mag-
netic ﬁeld changes in the AR.

Appendix

Figure 13 shows a snapshot of an extra sim-
ulation in which the RS-type bipole ﬁeld is in-
jected oﬀ the PIL. White/black area indicates the
positive/negative magnetic polarity area, and the
green tubes represent the magnetic ﬁeld lines. The
red surfaces correspond to the intensive electric
current layers. The major bipole is composed by
the large positive (LP) and the large negative (LN)
regions, and the major PIL is located between LP
and LN. The small-scale bipole ﬁeld, that satisﬁes
the RS-type condition, intrude into the LP region,
and it is composed by the small positive (SP) and
the small negative (SN) regions. Note that the
RS-type bipole ﬁeld intrude to the positive po-
larity region while the IPP (positive polarity) in-
trude to the negative polarity (N1) region in the
AR 12192. Moreover, the magnetic helicity in the
simulation is positive while the magnetic helicity
in the analyzed active region is negative.

Figure 13 shows the snapshot between the step-
1 and step-2 reconnection, i.e. between the inter-
nal reconnection and ﬂare reconnection of the RS
scenario in KB12 model. The overlying ﬁeld con-
necting LP-LN and small bipole ﬁeld SP-SN are
equivalent to the P1-N1 loops (orange loops) and
the IPP-N2 loops (magenta loops) in Figures 10
and 11, respectively. The small loops connecting
SP-LN and LP-SN are equivalent to the IPP-N1
and P1-N2 (green loops in Figure 11(b)). The ver-
tical electric current layer is formed over the center
of the SN region as the step-1 reconnection pro-
ceeds between the LP-LN and SP-SN loops. This
vertical electric current is observed as the bright-
ening B3 and CR2 in AIA 1600 ˚A and 304 ˚A
images (Figures 2 and 4). Then the large-scale
sheared loops (LP-LN) collapse inward and the
ﬂare ribbons appeared at the foot points in the

LP and LN regions. These ribbons are equivalent
to the CR1 and CR3 of the C-class ﬂares. There-
fore, the locations of the intensive electric current
layer are consistent with the RS-type case.

Moreover,

the twisted ﬂux rope, which is
formed by the reconnection between LP-LN and
SP-SN loops, asymmetrically rise up from the
LN-side in the simulation. In the analyzed active
region, the ﬂux rope illustrated by the thick or-
ange line in Figure 11 starts eruption from the
P1-side. Therefore, the step-3 reconnection of the
sky-blue loops connecting P1-N2 occurs earlier by
the asymmetric rise of the underlying ﬂux rope,
and the ﬂare ribbons XR1 and XR2 appears earlier
than XR3.

Obviously, the highly sheared loops corresponding to the C9.7 and the X1.0 ﬂare are lower than the isosurface
