Are complex magnetic ﬁeld structures responsible for the
conﬁned X-class ﬂares in super active region 12192?

Jun Zhang, Ting Li, Huadong Chen

ABSTRACT

From 2014 October 19 to 27, six X-class ﬂares occurred in super active region
(AR) 12192. They were all conﬁned ﬂares and were not followed by coronal
mass ejections (CMEs). To examine the structures of the four ﬂares close to
the solar disk center from October 22 to 26, we employ ﬁrstly composite triple-
time images in each ﬂare process to display the stratiﬁed structure of these ﬂare
loops. The loop structures of each ﬂare in both lower (171 ˚A) and higher (131 ˚A)
temperature channels are complex, e.g., the ﬂare loops rooting at ﬂare ribbons
are sheared or twisted (enwound) together, and the complex structures have not
been destroyed during the ﬂares. For the ﬁrst ﬂare, although the ﬂare loop system
appears as a spindle shape, we can estimate their structure from observations,
with lengths ranging from 130 to 300 Mm, heights from 65 to 150 Mm, widths at
the middle part of the spindle from 40 to 100 Mm, and shear angles from 16◦ to
90◦. Moreover, the ﬂare ribbons display irregular movements, such as the left
ribbon fragments of the ﬂare on 22 swept a small region repeatedly, and the both
ribbons of the ﬂare on 26 moved along the same direction, instead of separating
from each other. These irregular movements also imply that the corresponding
ﬂare loops are complex, e.g.
several sets of ﬂare loops are twisted together.
Although previous studies suggest that the background magnetic ﬁelds prevent
conﬁned ﬂares from erupting, we ﬁrstly suggest based on these observations that
the complex ﬂare loop structures may be responsible for these conﬁned ﬂares.

Introduction

The ﬂares associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are termed “eruptive ﬂares”
and the eruptive ﬂares usually last for a long period, from tens of minutes to hours (e.g.,
Zhang et al. 2007). Some ﬂares are not accompanied by CMEs in the wake of the eruption
(Ji et al. 2003), these ﬂares are called conﬁned ﬂares (e.g., Wang & Zhang 2007). The
occurrence rate of eruptive ﬂares is dependent on the ﬂare intensity and duration (Kahler
et al. 1989; Andrews 2003). The fraction of ﬂares that is associated with CMEs increases
rapidly as go from small ﬂares to large X-class ﬂares, reaching close to 100% for the largest
ones. For example, Yashiro et al. (2005) ﬁnd that the fraction of ﬂares associated with CMEs
increases from 20% for C3−C9 ﬂares to 100% for ﬂares above X3. Wang & Zhang (2007)
reported whether a ﬂare is eruptive or conﬁned is determined by the distance between the
ﬂares and the active regions, such as 22−37 Mm for eruptive ﬂares and 6−17 Mm for conﬁned
ﬂares. On the other hand, the overlying magnetic arcades provide strong conﬁnement, and
are believed to play an important role in the failed eruptions (e.g., T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005;
Guo et al. 2010; Cheng et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2013).

To explain the physical mechanism of eruptive events, many theories and models have
been proposed, in which the overlying magnetic loops should be opened so that plasma and
magnetic ﬂux can escape (Forbes et al. 2006). For the eruptive ﬂares, a rising ﬂux rope
stretches the overlying magnetic lines, then a magnetic reconnection between the stretching
lines takes place (Sturrock 1966; Masuda et al. 1994; Shibata et al. 1995; Tsuneta 1996).
The conﬁned ﬂares are mainly aﬀected by the surrounding coronal magnetic ﬁelds. T¨or¨ok
& Kliem (2005) and Fan & Gibson (2007) revealed that while the overlying arcade ﬁeld
decreases slowly with height, a conﬁned event is permitted. Furthermore, the calculations
from the potential ﬁeld source-surface model showed that stronger overlying magnetic arcades
will prevent energy release, thus resulting in conﬁned ﬂares (Wang & Zhang 2007; Guo et
al. 2010; Chen et al. 2015).

A large number of simulations about the question whether a conﬁguration fully or partly
erupts have been investigated. Examining the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability, an-
alyzing nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) models, and employing the techniques of ﬂux
rope insertion (van Ballegooijen 2004; van Ballegooijen et al. 2007) and magnetofrictional
relaxation (Yang et al. 1986), Kliem et al. (2013) conﬁrmed that the MHD treatment of
the eruptive conﬁguration can reappear some observed features. Considering the condition
that a toroidal ﬂux rope embeds in a bipolar or quadrupolar external ﬁeld, catastrophe and
torus instability occur at an X-line under the ﬂux rope where magnetic reconnection takes
place (Kliem et al. 2014a). Through studying force-free equilibria containing two vertically
arranged magnetic ﬂux ropes (Titov & Demoulin 1999; Liu et al. 2012), Kliem et al. (2014b)

– 3 –

have demonstrated several conditions for the two ropes activities, e.g. both the ropes turn
unstable, both the ropes erupt upward, and only the upper rope erupts while the lower rope
reconnects with the ambient ﬂux.

In this work, we report four conﬁned X-class ﬂares by analyzing the complex ﬂare loops,
with the observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) aboard
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). The data from the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al. 2014) are also employed to display the
special evolution of these ﬂare ribbons. In Section 2, we describe the observational data. The
results are presented in Section 3. Section 4 displays the conclusions and a brief discussion.

2. Observations

SDO/AIA observes the Sun in ten wavelengths with a 0′′.6 pixel size and a 12 s cadence.
These data reveal the solar atmospheric temperatures from ∼5000 K to ∼20 MK. The
SDO/HMI records the full disk line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld with a cadence of 45 s
and a spatial sampling of 0′′.5 pixel−1. We use the observations of 131, 171 and 1600 ˚A to
investigate the evolutions of ﬂare loops and ribbons, and the LOS magnetograms are applied
to display the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds of these loops. The data adopted here were
obtained from 2014 October 22 to 26 while AR 12192 was near the solar disk center. We
have de-rotated the AIA data to the same time (October 23 15:00 UT). Furthermore, two
sets of IRIS 1330 ˚A data are employed. The ﬁrst set of IRIS observations was taken from
08:18 UT to 18:07 UT on October 22, with a cadence of 33 s, a pixel scale of 0′′.16, and a ﬁeld
of view (FOV) of 120′′×119′′. The second was taken from 23:01 UT on October 25 to 11:15
UT on October 26, with the same pixel scale and FOV of the ﬁrst set, but the cadence is 18
s. The 1330 ˚A channel contains emission from the strong C II 1334/1335 ˚A lines that are
formed in the upper chromosphere and transition region. In order to compare the Doppler
shifts between the conﬁned ﬂare on October 26 and an eruptive one, we select a set of IRIS
data for the eruptive X-class ﬂare on September 10, 2014. These IRIS observations were
taken from 11:28 UT to 17:58 UT, with a FOV covering the majority of the AR 12158 (Li
& Zhang 2015).

3. Results

3.1. Overview of AR 12192

Due to hosting the largest sunspot group since 1990, AR 12192 observed in 2014 October
has been paid signiﬁcant attention (e.g., Sun et al. 2015; Thalmann et al. 2015). According
to the statistics by Chen et al. (2015), while AR 12192 passed across the visible solar disk
from October18 to 29, it produced 6 X-class and 29 M-class ﬂares. However, only one M-
ﬂare related to a CME (Li et al. 2015). These X-class ﬂares had a similar origin within
the AR and common spatial and timing characters, implying they were homologous ﬂares
(e.g., Zhang & Wang 2002; Sui et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2014), and Chen et al. (2015)
suggested that tether-cutting reconnection (Moore et al. 2001) trigger these homologous
ﬂares. Thalmann et al. (2015) provided evidence for repeated energy release, indicating
that the same magnetic ﬁeld structures were repeatedly involved in magnetic reconnection.
Sun et al. (2015) studied the magnetic conditions of the AR and suggested that the magnetic
non-potentiality over the restriction of background ﬁeld limited the eruptions. Photospheric
motions of emerged magnetic ﬂuxes lead to shearing the associated coronal magnetic ﬁeld,
which then yields a tether-cutting favorable conﬁguration (Chen et al. 2015).

3.2. Complex ﬂare loops

One outstanding feature of AR 12192 is its poor CME production rate, despite many
X-class ﬂares observed during its disk passage. Previous studies suggested that the overlying
background ﬁeld of the AR may play an important role in these conﬁned ﬂares. In this work,
we focus on the complex ﬂare loops themselves. Four X-class ﬂares (from October 22, 2014
to October 26, 2014) which occurred close to the solar disk center are studied. Figure 1
display the loops of the ﬁrst studied X-class ﬂare (X1 in Fig. 1a) on October 22, 2014.
During the ﬂare process, the ﬂare loops at higher temperature (e.g. 131 ˚A, Figs. 1d-1f,
see also the online animated version of Figure 1) were more abundant than those at lower
temperature (171 ˚A, Figs. 1a and 1b). These loops displayed complex structures, such as
the loops which are sheared relative to each other in Fig. 1e, and rooted at two ﬂare ribbons
which were more evident at 171 ˚A (Fig. 1a) and 1600 ˚A (Fig. 1c). From the corresponding
LOS magnetogram (Fig. 1g), we notice that the left ribbon overlaps the negative polarity
ﬁelds, and the right ribbon positive ﬁelds.

To better show these ﬂare loops, we employ for the ﬁrst time composite triple-time im-
ages of 131 ˚A observations which can clearly display the complex loops during ﬂare processes.
Composite triple-ﬁlter images (e.g. Zhang et al. 2015) from SDO/AIA are widely used to

– 5 –

display the diﬀerent temperature structures in the solar atmosphere. The composite triple-
time images are derived from the hint of composite triple-ﬁlter images, and are produced
by imitating the composite triple-ﬁlter images. The imitation is based on the observational
fact that the ﬂare loops brighten successively from lower to higher atmospheric levels in
the ﬂare process. In other words, each set of ﬂare loops seems immobile during the ﬂare
process. While we display these successively brightened loops with diﬀerent colours in ONE
image, stratiﬁed structure of these ﬂare loops appears. For example, in Fig. 1h, the blue
loops are lower and shorter, yellow loops are located at the middle layer, and the red loops
are higher and longer, and are located at the highest layer. The majority of the ﬂare loops
rooted at a small region on the left, but on the right the loops rooted at a long extending
ribbon, thus appearing a spindle structure (see Figs. 1c and 1h). The lengths of ﬂare loops
can be reliably measured. Assuming that the loops are semicircular conﬁgurations, so the
corresponding height (equals the half of the length) can be determined also. To describe the
properties of these loops, the lengths, heights (widths) of particular loops (loop systems) of
the ﬁrst ﬂare, the lengths and heights of the other three ﬂare loops are listed in Table 1. Cer-
tainly the assumption may not be well justiﬁed in complex active regions, as the loops have
a more complicated geometry far away from circular. The heights of loops in each ﬂare are
for references only. To quantitatively describe the complexity of the ﬂare loops, shear angles
in the ﬁrst two ﬂares are measured by comparing the observed loops with the AR’s prime
neutral lines deduced from the magnetograms. The ﬂare loops are higher non-potential, e.g.
strong shear (or deviating from potential ﬁelds) in 131 ˚A images. The shear angles of X1
loops distribute from 16◦ to 90◦ (see Table 1).

Figure 3 shows the loops of the second studied X-class ﬂare (X2 in Fig. 3a) on October
24, 2014. Similar to the ﬁrst ﬂare displayed in Figure 1, this ﬂare shown also complex loop
structures. The twisted loops were observed in lower (171 ˚A, Figs. 3b and 3c) temperature
wavelength, and the shear angles are estimated from 30◦ to 85◦ (see Fig. 3h and Table 1).
The last two X-class ﬂares, which occurred on October 25 and 26 respectively, were displayed

in Figure 4. Also these ﬂare loops were non-potential, and the shear of the loops was evident
(see Fig. 4b and the window region of Fig. 4f). As the third and fourth ﬂares were near
the solar limb, the widths and the shear angles of ﬂare loop systems can not be reliably
measured. During all the four X-class ﬂare processes, the complex structures had not been
destroyed. Also the signal for the open and shrink of these ﬂare loops was not evident.

3.3. Special evolution of ﬂare ribbons

Previous studies for these ﬂares have realized the large initial separation of these ﬂare
ribbons, together with an almost absent growth in ribbon separation, suggests a conﬁned
reconnection site high up in the corona. Two sets of IRIS 1330 ˚A data with high spatial
resolution allow us to investigate the detail evolution of the ribbons of the ﬁrst and the
fourth ﬂares. Figure 2 is time series of the ﬁrst set of IRIS 1330 ˚A images (also see the
online animated version of Figure 2) which show the evolution of four fragments (marked
by “R1”, “R2”, “R3”, and “R4”, respectively) of the ﬂare “X1” ribbons (see Fig. 1). “R1”
which belongs to the right ribbon and appears as a hook propagates leftward. The moving
speed of “R1” has been deduced by examining the evolution of the ribbons observed from
IRIS images. As the spatial resolution of the IRIS data is much high (0′′.16 per pixel), and
the moving process lasted a long time (13.5 min, see Figs. 2a and 2e), the speed error is
small. Considering the position error is 2 pixels while we measure the speeds, the speed error
is 0.6 km s−1, so the propagating speed is 19±0.6 km s−1 (Fig. 2e). The three fragments
“R2”, “R3”, and “R4” belong to the left ribbon of the ﬂare. They appear successively, and
sweep repeatedly a small region anticlockwise. Another evolution pattern of ﬂare ribbons
revealed by the second set of IRIS 1330 ˚A data is both of the two ribbons move along the
same direction, instead of separating from each other. Figures 5a and 5b show the evolution
of two ribbons of the fourth ﬂare (X4) in the ﬁeld-of-view outlined in Fig. 4f. Both the
ribbons move rightward, with a speed of 11±0.5 km s−1 (19±0.5 km s−1) for the left (right)
ribbon (see Fig. 5c).

3.4. Diﬀerent Doppler shifts between a conﬁned ﬂare and an eruptive one

As there is no material escape from the solar atmosphere in a conﬁned ﬂare process, the
Doppler shifts between a conﬁned ﬂare and an eruptive one will be diﬀerent. We compare the
conﬁned ﬂare (X4) on 2014 October 26 with the eruptive one on 2014 September 10. Figure
5d shows the variation of the GOES soft X-ray ﬂux (blue curve) in the X4 ﬂare duration.
The black cross symbols show the Doppler shifts in the position (denoted by a yellow cross

– 7 –

symbol in Fig. 5b) which locates at the middle region of the two ﬂare ribbons. The redshift
velocities (10−30 km s−1) are almost stable during the ﬂare process. Furthermore, Figs.
4e-4h have already showed that these ﬂare loops are restricted to a limited region. For the
ﬂare with mass ejection on 2014 Sep. 10, we can not plot truly the heights of the ﬂare loops
above the photosphere where the Doppler velocity has been measured, as the loops at the
position rise almost along the line-of-sight. Fortunately we can track the loops which cross
over the position (where the Doppler velocity has been measured) from one footpoint to
another one, so the relative height of the loop at other position can be truly measured (see
Figs. 5e−5g). Near 17:25 UT on 2014 Sep. 10, the projective height of the loops reached
100 Mm, and the rising speed exceeded 200 km s−1. Moreover, the eruptive X-class ﬂare
displayed diﬀerent Doppler shifts, e.g. at the later phase of the ﬂare, the redshift velocities
in the middle of the two ribbons increased from 30 km s−1 to about 80−100 km s−1 (Fig.
5h, see Li & Zhang 2015).

4. Conclusions and Discussion

Examining the evolution of the four ﬂares from October 22 to 26, we note that the loop
structures of each ﬂare in both lower (171 ˚A) and higher (131 ˚A) temperature channels were
complex, e.g., the ﬂare loops rooting at ﬂare ribbons were twisted (enwound) together, strong
shear among loops and evidently non-potential features of the ﬂare loops. IRIS observations
display that the ﬂare ribbons underwent irregular movement, such as the left ribbon of the
ﬂare on 22 swept repeatedly a small region, and the both ribbons of the ﬂare on 26 moved
along the same direction, instead of separating from each other. By comparing the conﬁned
ﬂare X4 with the eruptive one on 2014 September 10, we ﬁnd that the eruptive ﬂare displayed
a strong Doppler redshift enhancement and the rising speed of the ﬂare loops reached 200 km
s−1 at the late phase of the ﬂare, but no redshift enhancement for the conﬁned one, implying
that the complex ﬂare loops did not open and then shrink. Based on these observations, we
ﬁrstly suggest that the complex ﬂare structures tie themselves up, and there is no enough
energy to untangle these fastened structures, so these ﬂares are observed as conﬁned ones.

In previous studies, the dominant idea to interpret conﬁned ﬂares is the overlying loops
preventing the ﬂares from being eruptive. Indeed there are some large-scale coronal loops
above conﬁned ﬂares are observed (Yang et al. 2014). However, the complex ﬂare loops may
also play a key role, but it is always omitted. In fact, observations reveal that there are many
loops involved in a ﬂare, and these loops will erupt if the ﬂare is an eruptive one. Under the
condition that these eruptive loops are individual, e.g. potential ﬁeld loops, the overlying
loops should cover fully all these individual ﬂare loops to prevent them from erupting. So we

– 8 –

should observe a network (or a dome) which consists by the overlying loops enwrapping the
ﬂare loops. On the contrary, only one or two sets of overlying loops (arcades) are detected
during conﬁned ﬂare processes (Chen et al. 2013, Yang et al. 2014). These evidences suggest
that the ﬂare loops are not individual, instead, they are enwound together, so one or two
set of overlying loops can prevent them from erupting. Our observations supporting that
the loops of each studied ﬂare are indeed enwound together. Liu et al. (2014) reported a
conﬁned ﬂare with a quasi-static cusp-shaped structure which consists of multiple nested
loops, implying that the ﬂare loops are also enwound together.

Another evidence to display the complex ﬂare loops is the evolution of ﬂare ribbons. The
ﬂare ribbons are considered as mapping the energy release site in solar ﬂares. The movement
of the ribbons and its relationship to magnetic ﬁelds are important for understanding the
magnetic reconnection process. The two ribbons in many ﬂares appear to separate from
each other during the developing process of the ﬂares (e.g., Fletcher & Hudson 2002; Qiu
et al. 2002; Asai et al. 2004; Veronig et al. 2006; Miklenic et al. 2007; Temmer et al.
2007; Li & Zhang 2009). In our studied events, the two ribbons of each ﬂare are evident,
but the separation of the two ribbons is absent. Furthermore, the detail observations from
IRIS display that the ribbons undergo special evolution. For the ﬁrst studied ﬂare, the
ribbon fragments (see Fig. 2) “R2”, “R3” and “R4” swept successively a small region along
diﬀerent directions, indicating that the corresponding ﬂare loops are enwound together. AIA
observations conﬁrm that the ﬂare loops are enwound, e.g. shear each other in Fig. 1e. For
the fourth ﬂare, the two ribbons move along the same direction (Figs. 5a and 5b) with speeds
of 10 to 20 km s−1, instead of separation. We can imagine that only braiding ﬂare loops can
produce the two ribbons moving along the same direction, and the AIA observations (shear
loops in Fig. 4) support the scenario.

During the fourth ﬂare process, the redshift velocities (10−30 km s−1) at the mid-
dle region of the two ribbon are almost stable, suggesting that there is no violent upward
(downward) movement enhancement in the lower atmosphere. In other words, the complex
magnetic structures relevant to the ﬂare do not undergo ascending (descending) process, or
the complex magnetic structures are stable and do not aﬀect by the ﬂare. For comparison,
the eruptive X-class ﬂare on 2014 September 10 displayed diﬀerent Doppler shifts, e.g. at
the later phase of the ﬂare, the redshift velocities at post-ﬂare loop position increased from
30 km s−1 to about 80−100 km s−1 (Fig. 5h) in the transition region (Li & Zhang 2015),
implying the violent downward-moving cool and dense chromospheric and transition region
condensations (Fisher et al. 1985) during the gradual phase. This study is only a prelimi-
nary step to investigate the complex magnetic structures for conﬁnement of solar ﬂares. To
further evaluate the eﬀectiveness of these complex structures, a more robust study involving
more events is needed.

Fig. 1.— Panels (a)−(b): 171 ˚A images showing the ﬂare ribbons and post ﬂare loops of the
ﬁrst studied X-class ﬂare (X1 in Fig. 1a) on October 22, 2014 at lower temperature. Panel
(c): 1600 ˚A image displaying the two ﬂare ribbons which are denoted by one green circle and
four green arrows, respectively. The white window outlines the ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) displayed
in Figure 2. Panels (d)−(f): 131 ˚A images showing the ﬂare loops at higher temperature
(also see the online animation). White (Fig. 1d) and black (Figs. 1e and 1f) curves outline
the lengths (see Table 1) of the ﬂare loops at diﬀerent times. Two red curves in Figs. 1d
and 1f denote the widths of the loop systems, and two crossed blue curves in Fig. 1e show
the shear of the loops. Panel (g): corresponding line-of-sight (LOS) magnetogram. The blue
and green curves are the contours of the ﬂare ribbons displaying in panel (c). The green,
blue, and red pluses correspond to the locations of the maximum negative ﬂux, maximum
positive ﬂux, and their midpoint, respectively. The red line outlines the AR prime magnetic
polarity inversion line (PIL, Chen et al. 2015). Panel (h): composite triple-time images of
131 ˚A images consisting of 14:02 UT (blue), 14:10 UT (green) , and 14:34 UT (red) images.
The white line is the duplication of the PIL (the red line in Fig. 1g). The blue, yellow and
red curves are the duplications of the white curve in Fig. 1d, the black curve in Fig. 1e and
the black curve in Fig. 1f, respectively. The angle 16◦ represents the shear angle between the
blue arrow (represents the tangent of the blue curve at the intersection of the blue curve and
PIL) and the white arrow (the line perpendicular to the PIL). An online animated version
of the 131 ˚A images is available. The 14s animation runs from 14:00 to 15:00 UT.

Fig. 2.— Time series of IRIS 1330 ˚A images showing the evolution of four fragments (marked
by “R1”, “R2”, “R3”, and “R4”, respectively) of the two ﬂare ribbons (see Fig. 1). Panel
(a): the ﬁrst appearance of “R1” ( outlines by a solid yellow curve) and “R2” (outlines by
leftward sweeping of “R2”. The blue arrows denote the
a solid blue curve). Panel (b):
sweeping direction, the blue solid curve outlines the left boundary of “R2”, and the dotted
blue curve is the duplication of the blue curve in Fig. 2a. Panel (c): “R3” (outlined by a red
curve) ﬁrst appearance. Panel (d): “R4” (the purple curve) ﬁrst appearance. The dotted
yellow arrows in Figs. 2c and 2e denote the propagating direction of “R1” from the curve
top of “R1”, and the solid yellow arrow in Fig. 2g the shrinking direction of “R1”. This
propagation last almost twenty minutes (from 14:04 UT to 14:24 UT, see Figs. 2a−2f), with
the largest propagating speed of 19±0.5 km s−1 (see Fig. 2e). “R1” enlarges at ﬁrst, and
then shrinks (see the solid yellow curves in Figs. 2e and 2g). The dotted curve in Fig. 2e
is the duplication of the yellow curve in Fig. 2a, and the dotted curve in Fig. 2g is the
duplication of the solid curve in Fig. 2e. “R3” sweeps up-leftward (see the red curve in
Fig. 2g), with the red arrows denoting the sweeping direction, and the dotted red curve the
duplicate of the curve in Fig. 2c. “R4” sweeps down-leftward (see the purple curve in Fig.
2h, the arrows denote the sweeping direction). The dotted purple curve in Fig. 2h is the
duplication of the curve in Fig. 2d. An online animated version of this Figure is available.
The 9s animation runs from 14:00 to 15:00 UT.

Fig. 5.— Panels (a)−(b): two IRIS 1330 ˚A images showing the evolution of two ribbons
of the fourth ﬂare (X4) in the FOV outlined in Fig. 4f. Dashed line “A-B” shows the cut
position used to obtain the stack plots shown in Fig. 5c. A yellow cross symbol in Fig.
5b denotes a position where Doppler shifts are measured. Panel (d): the variation of the
GOES soft X-ray ﬂux (blue curve) in the X4 ﬂare duration. The black cross symbols show
the Doppler shifts in the position denoted in Fig. 5b. Panel (e): AIA 131 ˚A image showing
the loops of AR 12158 on 2014 September 10. The white window outlines the FOV of Fig.
5f. A yellow star symbol denotes a position where Doppler shift are measured. Red dashed
line “C-D” shows the cut position used to obtain the stack plot shown in Fig. 5g, and yellow
dashed curve tracks a loop system which crosses the star symbol position. The loop system
erupts afterward, with the rising speed exceeding 200 km s −1. Panel (f): IRIS 1400 ˚A image
showing a ribbon of the eruptive X-class ﬂare in AR 12158. A yellow star symbol denotes
the same position as the star in Fig. 5e. Panel (h): the variation of the GOES soft X-ray
ﬂux (blue curve) in the ﬂare (on 2014 September 10) duration. The black star symbols show
the Doppler shifts in the position denoted in Figs. 5e and 5f.
