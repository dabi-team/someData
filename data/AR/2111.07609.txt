The nuclear medium eﬀects are studied in the ντ /¯ντ interactions from nuclei in the deep inelastic
scattering (DIS) region and applied to the 40Ar nucleus to obtain the scattering cross sections
in the energy region of the proposed DUNE experiment. The free nucleon structure functions
(FiN (x, Q2); (i = 1 − 5)) have been calculated at the next-to-leading order (NLO) using Martin-
Motylinski-Harland Lang-Thorne 2014 as well as the Coordinated Theoretical-Experimental Project
on QCD parameterizations for parton distribution functions (PDFs) and including the eﬀect of
perturbative and nonperturbative QCD corrections [1]. These free nucleon structure functions are
then convoluted with the nucleon spectral function in the nucleus to obtain the nuclear structure
functions (FiA(x, Q2); (i = 1 − 5)). The nucleon spectral function takes into account the Fermi
motion and the binding energy of the nucleons as well as the nucleon correlations within the nucleus.
These nuclear structure functions are then used to calculate the deep inelastic scattering cross
sections. Moreover, the contribution of π and ρ mesons as well as the corrections due to the
shadowing and antishadowing eﬀects in the relevant kinematic region of the Bjorken variable x are
also included. The numerical results for the nuclear structure functions and scattering cross sections
have been presented and compared with the results obtained in the phenomenological approach using
nuclear PDFs from nCTEQ15 and nCTEQnu.

INTRODUCTION

The tau neutrino (ντ ) is experimentally the least studied Standard Model lepton due to the inherent diﬃculties
in producing a ντ beam in the laboratory. The “Direct Observation of the NU Tau” (DONUT) collaboration was
the ﬁrst to directly observe the tau neutrino charge current interaction in their experiment [2]. Later attempts
have been made by the “Neutrino Oscillation MAgnetic Detector” (NOMAD) [3] and the “Oscillation Project with
Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus” (OPERA) [4–7] collaboration experiments to study the ντ −
nucleon charged current
ντ oscillations in the νµ beam available at the high

With the increasing interest in ντ physics [10, 13–19] it is also important to understand the ντ −
sections in the nuclear targets [24, 25]. But a serious attempt to study these eﬀects quantitatively has been lacking
nucleus scattering
except for the earlier work of Paschos and Yu [20] in which the nuclear medium eﬀects in the ντ −
in the deep inelastic region has been incorporated at the leading order in the massless limit of quarks using the
phenomenological nuclear structure functions of Eskola et al. [26] and Hirai et al. [27]. However, some recent work
has been done to discuss the nuclear medium eﬀects in the cross sections and polarization of τ leptons produced in
the ντ induced quasielastic scattering [28, 29] but not in the case of deep inelastic scattering induced by ντ . This is
in contrast to the study of the deep inelastic scattering induced by the electron neutrinos (νe) and muon neutrinos
(νµ) from nuclei in which the nuclear medium eﬀects have been studied extensively [30–41]. Our aim in this paper is
to study the nuclear medium eﬀects in the deep inelastic scattering of tau neutrinos oﬀ nucleus in general and apply
it to the 40Ar nucleus in the energy region relevant for the DUNE experiment.

nucleon scattering from the free nucleons in the DIS region has been studied by many authors [20–23, 42–

40 Ar scattering
In this work we report on the study of the deep inelastic scattering cross sections for the ντ /¯ντ −
in the energy region relevant for the DUNE and atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments. The study includes
nuclear medium eﬀects mentioned above on the nucleon structure functions and cross sections except for the eﬀect
of the depolarization of the τ lepton in the ﬁnal state which is presently under investigation. The corrections due
to the nuclear medium eﬀects such as the Fermi motion, the binding energy and the nucleon correlations have been
calculated using the spectral function [47] of the nucleons in the nucleus. The mesonic contribution is also calculated
and is found to be signiﬁcant in the low and intermediate region of x and is incorporated following Ref. [48, 49]. The
(anti)shadowing corrections have been incorporated following the works of Kulagin and Petti [40]. Furthermore, the
eﬀects of applying a cut of the center of mass energy (W ) on the scattering cross section are also discussed.

Since the nucleon structure functions are the basic inputs in the determination of nuclear structure functions and the
scattering cross section, therefore, a proper understanding of the nucleon structure functions becomes quite important.
In the low and moderate Q2 region, the perturbative eﬀects such as the Q2 evolution of the parton distribution
functions from the leading order to the next-to-leading order (NLO), next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) as well
as the nonperturbative eﬀects like the kinematical higher twist eﬀect that is also known as the target mass correction
(TMC) which arises due to the massive quark contribution (e.g. charm, bottom, top) and dynamical higher twist
eﬀect (HT) which arises due to the multiparton correlations, become important. These nonperturbative eﬀects are
important in the kinematical region of high x and low Q2 [1].

∆(1232) and N

The inclusive cross sections at high energies and Q2 , are expressed in terms of the structure functions corresponding
to the deep inelastic scattering processes from the quarks and gluons. As one moves towards low energies one
encounters the region of shallow inelastic scattering (SIS) which constitutes of the resonant and the nonresonant
processes, with hadronic degrees of freedom. Presently, there is no sharp kinematic boundary to distinguish these two
regions. In the SIS region, several resonances contribute to the scattering cross section and the nucleon to resonance
transition is described in terms of nucleon-to-resonance transition form factors. Presently these transition form factors
N ∗(1440) transitions. All the (anti)neutrino experiments are being
are studied only for the N
performed using nuclear targets and the properties of the resonances like their widths and masses may be modiﬁed
in the nuclear medium, while there is not much study on the nuclear medium modiﬁcations on the properties of
these resonances except for the ∆(1232) resonance. Due to the absence of any sharp cut on the kinematical variables
deﬁning the separation of the SIS and DIS regions, in literature, there is large variation in the consideration of the
values of W and Q2 on the onset of the DIS region. Lalakulich et al. [50] have suggested a constrain of 1.1 GeV
1.6 GeV on the center of mass energy in order to avoid the double counting of events in the transition region,
≤
while Hagiwara et al. [22] considers this limit to be 1.4 GeV
1.6 GeV, whereas W > 1.4 GeV have been
considered by Gazizov et al. [51] and Kretzer et al. [52], as the onset of DIS processes. Besides theoretical studies,
in the Monte Carlo event generators like NEUT [53] and GENIE [54] these boundaries are taken to be W > 2 GeV
1 GeV2
and W > 1.7 GeV, respectively, for the simulation of neutrino events. The region of W
is considered to be the region of safe DIS or true DIS in MINERvA experiment [55, 56]. Recently this ambiguity in
deﬁning the onset of the DIS region has been discussed in the literature [57, 58]. In Fig. 1, kinematic regions for the
diﬀerent processes such as elastic, inelastic, deep inelastic as well as soft DIS induced by νµ and ντ are shown. From
the ﬁgure, one may notice the reduced kinematic region for ντ events as compared to the allowed νµ events. This is
due to the mass of the τ

The proposed experiment, DUNE at the Fermilab is very promising and plans to resolve many subtle issues like a
comprehensive investigation of neutrino oscillations to test CP violation in the lepton sector, determining the ordering
50%
of neutrino masses, etc. Due to the relatively broad and high energy neutrino spectrum at DUNE, about 40
of the neutrino interactions will come from deep inelastic scattering rather than the quasielastic scattering and single
pion production reactions (
40% combined), and it is expected that about 60% of the events would come from the
combined region of SIS+DIS. Therefore, it is important to understand the eﬀect of the kinematical cut on the CM
energy W and Q2 on the cross section, while evaluating the contribution of the DIS cross section to the total cross
section. Therefore, in the present work, we have also studied the eﬀect of the CM energy cut of 1.6 GeV and 2 GeV
keeping Q2

1 GeV2 on the evaluation of the nuclear structure functions and the diﬀerential cross sections.

In the present work, the nucleon structure functions have been evaluated using the MMHT PDFs parameteriza-
tion [59] up to NLO in the four ﬂavor (u d, s, and c) minimal subtraction (MSbar) scheme [45]. The nonperturbative
eﬀects of TMC and HT have been included following Refs. [43, 44] and [45] respectively. The QCD corrections have
been ﬁrst evaluated at the free nucleon level and then the nuclear structure functions have been evaluated including
the nuclear medium eﬀects.

This paper proceeds as follows: Section II presents a brief formalism for the (anti)neutrino- nucleus DIS process.
This is followed by the discussion of the method for obtaining nuclear structure functions with nuclear medium
eﬀects due to the Fermi motion, the binding energy, the nucleon correlations, the mesonic contribution and the
(anti)shadowing. Section III presents the numerical results and their discussion. Section IV describes the summary
of our ﬁndings.

within a nucleus due to the multi-nucleon correlation eﬀect. Soft DIS region is nothing but the SIS region. The band after

II. FORMALISM

For the evaluation of the weak nuclear structure functions not much theoretical eﬀorts have been made except
that of Kulagin et al. [40, 41] and Athar et al. (Aligarh-Valencia group) [30–39]. Aligarh-Valencia group has studied
nuclear medium eﬀects in the structure functions in a microscopic model which uses relativistic nucleon spectral
function to describe the target nucleon momentum distribution incorporating the eﬀects of Fermi motion, binding
energy and nucleon correlations in a ﬁeld theoretical model. The spectral function that describes the energy and
momentum distribution of the nucleons in nuclei is obtained by using the Lehmann’s representation for the relativistic
nucleon propagator and nuclear many body theory is used to calculate it for an interacting Fermi sea in the nuclear
medium [47]. A local density approximation is then applied to translate these results to a ﬁnite nucleus. Furthermore,
the contributions of the pion and rho meson clouds in a many body ﬁeld theoretical approach have also been considered
which is based on Refs. [48, 49]. In this section, the theoretical approach of Aligarh-Valencia group is discussed brieﬂy.

The bound nucleons interact with each other through the strong force hence various nuclear medium eﬀects come
into the picture. Depending upon the value of the Bjorken variable x the various nuclear medium eﬀects have
diﬀerent contribution. The nuclear medium eﬀects such as Fermi motion, binding, nucleon correlations, meson cloud
contribution and shadowing eﬀect are discussed in the Subsections II.1, II.2 and II.3, respectively.

1. Fermi motion, binding and nucleon correlation

In order to calculate the cross section for the neutrino scattering oﬀ a bound nucleon inside the nucleus in the
presence of nuclear medium, we begin with a neutrino ﬂux hitting the target nucleons over a given period of time.
Since neutrinos are the weakly interacting particles; therefore majority of them will pass through the target without
having any interaction while a few neutrinos will interact with the target nucleons giving rise to ﬁnal state leptons
and hadrons. To consider the interaction of neutrinos, we introduce the concept of “neutrino self-energy”. The real
part of “neutrino self-energy” modiﬁes the lepton mass and imaginary part gives information about the total number
of neutrinos interaction that yield the ﬁnal state leptons and hadrons.

The cross section (dσA) for small elemental volume (dV ) inside the nucleus is related to the probability of neutrino
interaction with a bound nucleon per unit time (Γ). Probability times the diﬀerential of area (dS) deﬁnes the cross
section [48], i.e.

To obtain the relativistic nucleon propagator G(p0, p) in the nuclear medium we start with the relativistic free
nucleon Dirac propagator G0(p0, p), which is written in terms of the Dirac spinors for particles u(p) and antiparticles
v(p). This includes the contribution from positive and negative energy components of the nucleon, where the negative
energy contribution is suppressed while the positive energy contribution survives [47, 48]. Therefore, the free nucleon

FIG. 5: Diagrammatic representation of neutrino self-energy in the nuclear medium.

In the interacting Fermi sea, the relativistic nucleon propagator G(p0, p) is written in terms of the nucleon self-energy
ΣN (p0, p) (depicted in Fig.5), which contains all the information on single nucleon. Then in nuclear medium the
interaction is taken into account through Dyson series expansion, which can be understood as the quantum ﬁeld
theoretical analogue of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the dressed nucleons, which is in principle an inﬁnite
series in perturbation theory. We add this perturbative expansion in a ladder approximation (Fig.5) as:

G(p) = G0(p) + G0(p)ΣN (p)G0(p) + G0(p)ΣN (p)G0(p)ΣN (p)G0(p) + .......,

In the Bjorken limit, i.e. Q2

only on a single dimensionless variable x. However, if we move towards the region of low and moderate Q2, these
structure functions show Q2 dependence and therefore become the functions of x as well as Q2. The dimensionless
nucleon structure functions are generally expressed in terms of parton distribution functions at the leading order, for

where u(x)/¯u(x) represents the probability density of ﬁnding an up quark/antiquark with a momentum fraction

relation (F2N (x) = 2xF5N (x)) at the leading order. One may notice that at the leading order F4N (x) = 0 but
when the contribution from the next-to-leading order terms is taken into account, we ﬁnd that F4N (x) gives a non-
zero contribution. To evaluate the weak dimensionless nuclear structure functions by using Eq.21, the appropriate
components of the nucleon (W µν
A in Eq.4) hadronic tensors along the x, y and z
axis are chosen. For example, the expression of nuclear structure function F1A,N (xA, Q2) incorporating the nuclear
medium eﬀects like binding energy, Fermi motion and nucleon correlations is obtained by taking the xx components,
F3A,N (xA, Q2) by taking the xy components, etc. We obtain the expressions for all the ﬁve nuclear structure functions

The nonperturbative eﬀects of the target mass correction and the higher twist [43, 44] have been incorporated in
the free nucleon structure functions and then we have convoluted these nucleon structure functions with the spectral
function in order to evaluate the nuclear structure functions (Eq.26). Using the nuclear structure functions, we have
obtained the diﬀerential scattering cross sections for the ντ (¯ντ )

The nucleons which are bound inside the nucleus may interact with each other via meson exchange such as π, ρ, etc.,
and the interaction of the intermediate vector boson (IVB) with the mesons play an important role in the evaluation
of nuclear structure functions [33, 37]. This mesonic eﬀect has been incorporated and is discussed in the following
section (II 2).

2. Contribution of pion and rho meson to the nuclear structure function (Mesonic eﬀect)

Associated with each nucleon bound inside the nucleus there are virtual mesons (pion, rho meson, etc.) and because
of the strong attractive nature of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, the probability of a W ±-boson interaction with
the mesonic cloud becomes high. In this work we have included the π and ρ meson contributions [40, 48, 62, 63] as
the contribution from heavier mesons are expected to be very small due to their signiﬁcantly higher masses. The
pion cloud contribution is larger than that of rho-meson cloud as mπ << mρ. Nevertheless, the contribution of rho
meson is non-negligible, and both the contributions together add up in the whole x region. The mesonic contribution
dominates in the intermediate region of x (0.2 < x < 0.6). For the medium nuclei like 4He, 12C, etc., mesonic
contribution is small [32]; while it becomes pronounced in heavier nuclear targets like 40Ar, 56Fe, etc. [33]. In our
earlier works we have found that in F1A(x, Q2) and F2A(x, Q2) the mesonic contributions lead to an enhancement of
the nuclear structure function, and it works in the right direction to explain the experimental data [32, 35, 48].

Now to take into account the contribution from the virtual mesons, the neutrino self-energy is again evaluated using
many body techniques [48]. For the mesonic eﬀect we draw a diagram similar to Fig.3, but here a nucleon propagator
is replaced by a meson propagator. The meson propagator does not corresponds to the free mesons but it corresponds
to the mesons which are arising due to the nuclear medium eﬀects [47]. In the nuclear medium these mesons are
2h, etc. interactions as shown in Fig.6.

j is the longitudinal(transverse) part of the spin-isospin interaction

the ρ mesons same PDFs as for the pions have been used as there is no available explicit parameterization for the
ρ
meson PDFs in the literature. It is important to mention that mesonic contribution does not play any role to
−
F3A(x, Q2). The reason is that F3A(x, Q2) depends mainly on the valence quark distribution and not on the sea
quarks distribution. In the evaluation of F4A(x, Q2), the mesonic contribution has not been incorporated because
the mesonic PDFs for F4A(x, Q2) are not available in the literature and for F5A(x, Q2) mesonic eﬀect is included by
using the Albright-Jarlskog relation at the leading order as the parameterization for mesonic PDFs for F2A(x, Q2) is
available in the literature.

3. Shadowing and Antishadowing eﬀects

The shadowing eﬀect is taken into consideration following the works of Kulagin and Petti [40, 41], who have
used the Glauber-Gribov multiple scattering theory. In the case of νµ/¯νµ induced DIS processes, they have treated
(anti)shadowing diﬀerently from the prescription applied in the case of electromagnetic structure functions [40, 41],
due to the presence of the axial-vector current in the neutrino interactions. The interference between the vector and
the axial-vector currents introduces C-odd terms in the neutrino cross sections, which are described by structure
function F3(x, Q2). In their calculation of nuclear corrections, separate contributions to diﬀerent structure functions
according to their C-parity have been taken into account. This results in a diﬀerent dependence of nuclear eﬀects on
the nuclear structure functions depending upon their C-parity specially in the nuclear (anti)shadowing region [30].
nucleus
We have adopted the same prescription for the inclusion of (anti)shadowing eﬀect [40, 41] in case of ντ /¯ντ −
scattering.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The present model describes the nuclear structure functions FiA(xA, Q2); (i = 1

5), in terms of the nucleon
structure functions FiN (xN , Q2); (i = 1
5), convoluted with the spectral function of the nucleon in the nucleus (Sh).
The spectral function takes into account the eﬀect of Fermi motion, binding energy and nucleon correlations. The
results for the nucleon structure functions FiN (xN , Q2); (i = 1
5) at the leading order are obtained using nucleon
PDFs of MMHT [59]. The structure functions are obtained in the three massless ﬂavor (nf = 3) MSbar scheme as

−

−

−

12

well as in the four ﬂavor (nf = 4) MSbar scheme, taking the charm quark mass into account (mc = 1.3 GeV [45]). All
the numerical evaluations have been performed for Q2 > 1 GeV2. Then we evaluate the structure functions up to the
next-to-leading order following the works of Kretzer et al. [52]. The target mass correction has been included following
Ref. [45] and the dynamical higher twist (twist-4) correction has been taken into account following the methods of
Dasgupta et al. [43]. In the numerical results, the HT eﬀect is applied only on the three nucleon structure functions,
i.e. FiN (xN , Q2); (i = 1
3) and is not explicitly applied on the massive charm quark. Then the mesonic eﬀects
which include the contributions from the pion and the rho meson is taken into account for FiA(xA, Q2); (i = 1, 2, 5)
and (anti)shadowing eﬀect is also included into the nuclear structure functions FiA(xA, Q2) for i =1, 2, 3 and 5. For
the mesonic cloud contribution we use the pionic PDFs parameterization of Gluck et al. [64].

−

Let us ﬁrst recapitulate the ﬁndings of our earlier works [1, 39, 65], for the free nucleon structure functions:

• The eﬀect of higher order perturbative evolution of parton densities at the next-to-leading order, is to increase

the nucleon structure functions in the entire region of x.

• The eﬀect of target mass correction is to decrease the nucleon structure functions in the region of low x up to

x

0.5, after which it leads to an increase in the structure functions.

≤

• The inclusion of higher twist corrections results in a small change (< 1

low and moderate Q2. Quantitatively, in F3N (x, Q2) higher twist eﬀect is found to be 20%(7%) at x = 0.3 and

• The results of nucleon structure functions evaluated at NNLO with TMC eﬀect are found to be close i.e. within

< 1% to the results obtained at NLO with TMC and higher twist corrections.

• We ﬁnd that the inclusion of tau lepton mass leads to a reduction in the diﬀerential scattering cross section
which is predominantly due to the contribution from F5N (x, Q2), in addition to the kinematical eﬀect. The
contribution of F4N (x, Q2) to the cross section is small.

We now present the numerical results of the study performed in this work for ντ (¯ντ )

40Ar scattering with nuclear
medium eﬀects. In the numerical results ‘SF’ corresponds to the case when the results, are obtained using only the
spectral function, and the ‘Total’ corresponds to the results of the full model, where the additional contributions
from the meson clouds as well as the shadowing eﬀects are taken into account. The expression for the total nuclear
structure functions in the present model is given by:

−

FiA(x, Q2) = FiA,N (x, Q2) + FiA,π(x, Q2) + FiA,ρ(x, Q2) + FiA,shd(x, Q2),

(39)

where i = 1, 2, 5. FiA,N (x, Q2) are the nuclear structure functions which have contribution only from the spectral
function and FiA,π/ρ(x, Q2) is the contribution from the mesons.

FiA,shd(x, Q2); (i = 1, 2, 5) have contribution from the shadowing eﬀect given by [40]

where δRi(x, Q2) are the shadowing correction factors.

The full expression for the parity violating weak nuclear structure function F3A(x, Q2) is given by,

FiA,shd(x, Q2) = δRi(x, Q2)

Fi,N (x, Q2),

×

F3A(x, Q2) = F3A,N (x, Q2) + F3A,shd(x, Q2).

(40)

(41)

From Eq. 41, it may be noticed that F3A(x, Q2) has no mesonic contribution as the contribution to this structure
function comes mainly from the valence quarks (uv and dv). For F3A,shd(x, Q2) similar deﬁnition has been used [30]
as given in Eq.(40) following the works of Kulagin et al. [40].

In view of F4N (x, Q2) being very small as it vanishes in the leading order and contributes only due to higher order
corrections we have evaluated F4A(x, Q2) using only the spectral function, i.e., the contributions from the mesonic
and shadowing eﬀects have not been included, and therefore

F4A(x, Q2) = F4A,N (x, Q2).

(42)

The mesonic and the shadowing eﬀects have been incorporated in F5A(x, Q2) assuming the Albright-Jarlskog relation
between F5N (x, Q2) and F2N (x, Q2) to be valid for the mesons also at the leading order, and we use the following

reasonable agreement. Moreover, in Ref. [38], a comparative study of our theoretical results with the phenomenological
parameterizations of Whitlow et al. [73, 74] and nCTEQ15 nuclear PDFs [66] were made. In Refs. [30, 33, 37, 39], this

In the present work, the
numerical results of F2A(x, Q2) and xF3A(x, Q2) in argon have been compared with the results obtained using the
nCTEQ15 nuclear PDFs parameterization [66] as shown in Fig. 9. It may be noticed from the ﬁgure that the results
of F2A(x, Q2) are consistent with the phenomenological results of nCTEQ15 [66] while the results of xF3A(x, Q2) are
diﬀerent in the intermediate region of x (

0.4), however, this diﬀerence decreases with the increase in x and Q2.

We have also observed that the inclusion of W cut suppresses the nuclear structure functions as shown in Fig. 9.

The eﬀect of kinematical cut on W is summarized below:

(i) Due to the eﬀect of CM energy cut of 2 GeV, i.e. W > 2 GeV, the suppression in the results of F1A(x, Q2)
is found to be 14%(3%) at x = 0.1 and 18%(< 1%) at x = 0.3, while in F2A(x, Q2) it is found to be about
25%(< 1%) at x = 0.3 for Q2 = 2(20) GeV2. In F1A(x, Q2) and F2A(x, Q2) the
13%(< 1%) at x = 0.1 and
CM energy cut is important only in the low Q2 region, and this eﬀect becomes almost negligible for Q2 > 20
GeV2. It may be noticed that this suppression is x dependent (large suppression at higher values of x).

∼

(ii) The nature of suppression in F3A(x, Q2) is diﬀerent from F1A(x, Q2) and F2A(x, Q2) and is signiﬁcant even at
high Q2. Furthermore, it may be observed from Fig. 9 that the x dependence of F3A(x, Q2) is also diﬀerent from
20 GeV2. For example,

In Fig.10, the results for the nuclear structure functions F4A(x, Q2) and F5A(x, Q2) vs x, are shown, considering all
the cases discussed above for Fig.9. These are the two additional structure functions which contribute to the charged

at low Q2 (Q2
5) GeV2, while at higher values of x its contribution becomes almost negligible. For example,
when the evaluation of PDFs is performed at the next-to-leading order, we have observed that the value of F4N (x, Q2)
is ﬁnite and considerably large at very low x as compared to the leading order case, where F4N (x, Q2) = 0. Moreover,
we ﬁnd that in the case of bound nucleon the results of nuclear structure functions F4A(x, Q2) gets suppressed by
about 10%

With the increase in Q2 (20 GeV2 vs 2 GeV2), F4A(x, Q2) contributes only at very low x. The eﬀects of W cut and
charm mass are found to be small in F4A(x, Q2). For F5A(x, Q2), we have noticed that the x and Q2 dependence
is qualitatively similar as observed in the case of F2A(x, Q2). The eﬀect of nuclear corrections obtained only with
the spectral function has been found to be qualitatively similar in F5A(x, Q2) and F2A(x, Q2), and the mesonic cloud
contributions in F5A(x, Q2), which is incorporated using the Albright-Jarlskog relation at the leading order give rise to
an enhancement in the nuclear structure function. For example, at Q2 = 2(20) GeV2 the mesonic cloud contribution

Q2 the diﬀerence between F2A(x, Q2) and 2xF5A(x, Q2) becomes almost negligible. Other eﬀects like the inclusion of

parameterization [59] has been used. Dashed-dotted and solid lines represent the result of cross section with only the spectral
function and with the full model, respectively. Dash double-dotted and double-dash dotted lines, respectively show the results
for full model with W > 1.6 GeV and W > 2.0 GeV.

dxdy vs y is shown for the diﬀerent values
of x at Eν = 6.25 GeV. We ﬁnd that the contribution to the cross section comes from the intermediate and high
region of x, and for y
0.6, the mesonic
cloud contribution to the diﬀerential scattering cross section is signiﬁcant in the region of low inelasticity y, however,
it becomes small with the increase in y. For example, at x = 0.5 there is an enhancement of 23% for y = 0.2 and
16% for y = 0.3 in the full model as compared to the results obtained using only the spectral function. The kinematic
6 GeV2 is sensitive to the nonperturbative QCD corrections of higher twist eﬀect, the inclusion
region of 0.3
of which along with the TMC eﬀect leads to an enhancement of about 21% and 5% at x = 0.6 for y = 0.2 and y = 0.4,
respectively as compared to the results obtained only with the TMC eﬀect(not shown here explicitly). We have found
that the enhancement in the cross sections due to the HT eﬀect becomes more pronounced with the increase in x,
e.g., at x = 0.8, it is found to be 88% for y = 0.2 and 28% for y = 0.4. Furthermore, incorporation of the CM energy
cut in the numerical calculations further reduces the DIS cross section like at x = 0.6 and y = 0.4 (corresponding

point out that the application of W

negligible) contribution of DIS cross section in the considered kinematic region.

To study the energy dependence of the cross section, we have calculated the diﬀerential scattering cross sections at
Eν = 10 GeV as well as at Eν = 20 GeV and the corresponding results are presented in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively.
One may notice from the ﬁgures that with the increase in energy the diﬀerential cross section gets enhanced. For
example, we ﬁnd an enhancement of about 24%(30%) at x = 0.3 and 18%(17%) at x = 0.6 for y = 0.2(0.4) in the
results of cross section obtained at Eν = 20 GeV as compared to the results obtain at Eν =10GeV. It is important
to point out that up to Eν =20 GeV, the contribution to the cross section from the charm quark is negligible (not
shown here explicitly). Moreover, we have found that the eﬀect of twist-4 contribution (HT eﬀect) decreases with the
increase in energy, quantitatively as we move from Eν = 6.25 GeV to Eν = 10 GeV, a reduction of about 7%(1%)

reduces the cross section, however, this reduction becomes small with the increase in energy in the wide kinematic

To understand the impact of charged lepton mass on the scattering cross section in order to interpret the experi-
40 Ar deep inelastic scattering cross section,
mental data, we have also performed the numerical calculations for νµ −
where the contributions from F4A(x, Q2) and F5A(x, Q2) is negligible. Moreover, a comparison of the diﬀerential cross
40 Ar scattering processes has also been made to quantify the eﬀect of lepton

dxdy vs y are presented in Fig.14 at the diﬀerent values of x for Eνµ =6.25 GeV. For the sake of
40 Ar scattering cross section with the
completeness, we have made a comparison of these theoretical results for νµ −
results obtained using the phenomenological nuclear PDFs prescribed by nCTEQnu collaboration [80] to obtain the
cross sections. This comparative study gives an overview of existing uncertainties in the prediction of the cross sections.
We observe that the present theoretical results with the TMC eﬀect at NLO in the four ﬂavor MSbar scheme (solid
line) [86] show signiﬁcant deviation from the results obtained using the nCTEQnu nuclear PDFs parameterization [80]
specially in the region of high y and low x. However, in the intermediate range of x, i.e., 0.35
0.45 (presented
here) both the approaches are in reasonable agreement. It implies that in the region of few GeV (< 10 GeV) more
theoretical as well as phenomenological eﬀorts are required in order to develop a better understanding of neutrino
interactions.

FIG. 14: Predictions for the diﬀerential scattering cross section vs y, at diﬀerent values of x for Eν =6.25 GeV in νµ −40 Ar.
The results are obtained with a constrain on Q2 ≥ 1.0 GeV2 by using CTEQ6.6 nucleon PDFs [86] at NLO in the MS-bar

of safe DIS [57, 58]. From the ﬁgure, it may be noticed that the results of the diﬀerential cross section obtained with

production is small. While at higher energies viz. Eν = 10 GeV and Eν = 20 GeV, there is signiﬁcant contribution
of tau lepton events which results an enhancement in the diﬀerential cross section. From a quantitative analysis we
ﬁnd that due to the eﬀect of W > 2 GeV cut the results of diﬀerential cross sections at Eν = 10GeV get reduced
by 67%(22%) for the neutrino induced process and by 75%(38%) for the antineutrino process at y = 0.3(0.5). The

FIG. 19:
‘SF’ corresponds to the results only with the spectral function, and ‘Total’ corresponds to the results of full model, where the
additional contribution from the mesonic clouds and the shadowing eﬀects are taken into account. Results are obtained in
the four ﬂavor MSbar-scheme (massless quarks viz. u, d, s and massive c quark) by incorporating the TMC [45] and HT [43]
eﬀects at NLO. For the numerical calculations MMHT nucleon PDFs parameterization [59] has been used. Dash-dotted and
solid lines represent the results of cross section only with the spectral function and with the full model, respectively without
having any cut on the CM energy W . Double dash-dotted line shows the results for the full model with a cut of W > 2.0 GeV
on the CM energy.

• The inclusion of perturbative and nonperturbative eﬀects is quite important in the evaluation of the nucleon

structure functions as well as in the evaluation of the diﬀerential scattering cross sections.

• The nuclear structure functions obtained only with the spectral function is suppressed from the free nucleon
case in the entire region of x. However, with the increase in Q2, it has been observed that the suppression in
the nuclear structure functions due to nuclear medium eﬀects becomes small.

• When the mesonic contributions are included, we ﬁnd an enhancement in the nuclear structure functions
F1A(x, Q2), F2A(x, Q2) and F5A(x, Q2) in the low and intermediate region of x. We observe that the mesonic
contribution is dominant in the region of 0.2

0.6, and decreases with the increase in Q2.

• We ﬁnd that at low energy the double diﬀerential scattering cross section d

dxdy contributes only in the interme-
diate and high region of x for low and mid range of y. The results obtained with the center of mass energy cut
are found to be very small at Eν = 6.25 GeV. Although at higher neutrino energies (Eν = 10 GeV and 20 GeV)
scattering cross section get enhanced but even at these energies we observe that in the region of low y there is
signiﬁcant suppression in the results due to the eﬀect of CM energy cut. It implies that the deﬁnition of sharp
kinematic limits for the safe DIS region is quite important in order to avoid the contribution coming from the
inelastic region to be calculated using DIS formalism.

• For antineutrino induced process the scattering cross section gets reduced as compared to the case of neutrino
induced process which was expected. However, the qualitative behavior of lepton mass eﬀect, center of mass
energy cut, massive charm quark and nuclear medium eﬀects are found to be similar.
