Abstract
We study the properties of 115 coronal holes in the time-range from 2010/08 to 2017/03,
the peak velocities of the corresponding high-speed streams as measured in the ecliptic at
1 AU, and the corresponding changes of the Kp index as marker of their geo-eﬀectiveness.
We ﬁnd that the peak velocities of high-speed streams depend strongly on both the areas and
the co-latitudes of their solar source coronal holes with regard to the heliospheric latitude
of the satellites. Therefore, the co-latitude of their source coronal hole is an important pa-
rameter for the prediction of the high-speed stream properties near the Earth. We derive the
largest solar wind peak velocities normalized to the coronal hole areas for coronal holes lo-
cated near the solar equator, and that they linearly decrease with increasing latitudes of the
coronal holes. For coronal holes located at latitudes & 60°, they turn statistically to zero,
indicating that the associated high-speed streams have a high chance to miss the Earth. Sim-
ilar, the Kp index per coronal hole area is highest for the coronal holes located near the solar
equator and strongly decreases with increasing latitudes of the coronal holes. We interpret
these results as an eﬀect of the three-dimensional propagation of high-speed streams in the
heliosphere, i.e., high-speed streams arising from coronal holes near the solar equator propa-
gate in direction towards and directly hit the Earth, whereas solar wind streams arising from
coronal holes at higher solar latitudes only graze or even miss the Earth.

1 Introduction

Since the 1970s, it is well known that solar coronal holes, i.e., coronal regions with
a reduced density and temperature as compared to the ambient corona and an open mag-
netic ﬁeld topology, are the source of high-speed solar wind streams, i.e., supersonic plasma
streams transcending our solar system [Nolte et al., 1976]. The supersonic plasma streams
propagate radially away from the rotating Sun and form a branch of the Parker’s spiral [Parker,
1958]. Thereby, they compress the preceding plasma of the slow solar wind and form a shock
region, known as stream interaction region (SIR). Whenever the high-speed solar wind streams
and the associated SIRs hit the Earth, they compress the Earth’s magnetosphere and may
cause geomagnetic storms. Since high-speed solar wind streams are the major cause of mi-
nor and medium geomagnetic storms at Earth at the solar declining phase [Richardson et al.,
2000], and since high-speed solar wind streams are thought to precondition the interplan-
etary space and the state of the Earth’s magnetosphere for subsequent stronger events like
coronal mass ejections [CMEs; Gonzalez et al., 1996], the forecast for the properties of high-
speed solar wind streams is of high interest.

The current real-time forecast models for the velocity of high-speed solar wind streams

near the Earth are based on simulations of the heliosphere and of the solar corona (e.g.,
ENLIL, Odstrcil [2003]), on an empirical relationship to the ﬂux tube expansion factor of the
magnetic ﬁeld evaluated between the bottom of coronal holes and the source surface at about
2.5R⊙ (e.g. the Wang-Sheeley-Arge model; Arge & Pizzo 2000; Arge et al. 2003), and/or on
a statistical relationship to the area of coronal holes (e.g. the Empirical Solar Wind Forecast;
Rotter et al. 2012; Reiss et al. 2016). Note that the empirical and statistical forecast mod-
els are related to each other: Fainshtein & Kaigorodov [1994] showed that the area, the ﬂux
tube expansion factor, and the photospheric mean magnetic ﬁeld density below the bottom of
coronal holes depend on each other.

In the following, we focus on the statistical relationship between the area of coronal
holes and the velocity of high-speed streams as measured in the ecliptic at 1 AU. In 1976,
Nolte et al. [1976] showed that the areas of 3 low-latitude coronal holes which crossed the
central meridian in total 15 times between 1973/05 and 1974/02 correlate with the peak ve-
locities of the corresponding high-speed solar wind streams with a Pearson correlation coef-
ﬁcient cc = 0.96. Abramenko et al. [2009] extended the study to 44 single low-latitude coro-
nal holes observed between 2001 and 2006 and found that their area correlates with the peak
velocity of the corresponding high-speed streams at L1 with cc = 0.75. Karachik & Pevtsov

–2–

[2011] revealed that the projected areas of 108 single coronal holes observed between 1998
and 2008 also correlate with the peak velocity at L1 with cc = 0.41 − 0.65, with the high-
est correlation at medium solar activity, i.e., at the rising and declining phase of the solar
cycle. Further, Wang & Sheeley [1990] studied the three-month-averages of the total area
coronal holes covering on the Sun’s disk between 1967 and 1988 and found that they corre-
late with the three-month-averages of the velocity of high-speed streams measured near the
Earth. Vršnak et al. [2007a] derived that also the area of coronal holes within a meridional
slice of [-10◦, 10◦] correlates well with the peak velocity of high-speed streams measured at
L1 with cc = 0.62, studying a period of 100 days in 2005. Both Wang & Sheeley [1990] and
Vršnak et al. [2007b] reported that the correlations degrade when polar coronal holes were
excluded.

Further, Vršnak et al. [2007b] showed that the total area coronal holes cover within a
meridional slice of [-10◦, 10◦] also correlates with the drop of the geomagnetic Dst index
induced by the impacting high-speed solar wind streams. The Pearson correlation coeﬃcient
between the areas and the Dst index is cc = 0.31. The correlation increases to cc = 0.86
when taking into account the Russel-McPherron eﬀect [Russell & McPherron, 1973]. Again,
the correlation decreases if the polar coronal holes are excluded from the analysis.

Note that these results are statistical relationships between the coronal hole area, the

peak velocities of high-speed solar wind streams at L1, and the strength of geomagnetic
storms. They neglect the three-dimensional propagation of high-speed solar wind streams
in the heliosphere and thus the three-dimensional nature of the relation between coronal
hole areas, high-speed solar wind stream peak velocities at L1, and strengths of geomagnetic
storms.

The three-dimensional distribution of the solar wind in the inner heliosphere was ﬁrst

investigated by the satellite Ulysses [Marsden, 2001]. Investigations based on data from
Ulysses showed that at solar minimum, the heliospheric distribution of the solar wind is
dominated by high-speed solar wind streams from medium to high heliospheric latitudes
arising from large polar coronal holes, and by the slow solar wind streams near the ecliptic
[McComas et al., 2000]. In contrast, at solar maximum, both slow and high-speed solar wind
streams are apparent from the ecliptic up to high latitudes [McComas et al., 2001]. Further,
Ulysses sampled the heliospheric distribution of a high-speed solar wind stream arising from
a stable coronal hole at solar maximum. They found that the heliospheric velocity distribu-
tion strongly depended on the boundary of the polar coronal hole, and that the corresponding
high-speed stream expanded down to ≈ 55 − 70° heliospheric latitude [McComas, 2003].

While, it is not clear (1) whether the area of single coronal holes or the total area coro-

nal holes cover on the solar disk is the better predictor for the high-speed solar wind stream
peak velocity at L1, (2) how the presence of large polar coronal holes contribute to the speeds
of high-speed solar wind streams arising from single low- and mid-latitude coronal holes,
(3) how the morphology of coronal holes aﬀects the speeds of high-speed streams, (4) how
the relationship between high-speed stream peak velocities at L1 and coronal hole areas is
aﬀected by the three-dimensional propagation of high-speed solar wind streams in the helio-
sphere, and (5) how the relationship between high-speed stream peak velocities and coronal
hole areas change over the solar cycle.

In this paper, we analyse the properties of 115 coronal holes observed by the satel-
lites SDO, STEREO A, and STEREO B distributed over all latitudes between 2010 and
2017, their relationship to the peak velocity of their related high-speed solar wind streams
measured by the satellites ACE, STEREO A, and STEREO B, and their relationship to the
strength of geomagnetic storms induced by the high-speed solar wind streams for a subset of
the 52 Earth-directed high-speed solar wind streams. Besides the well-known relationship
between the high-speed solar wind stream peak velocities and the areas of their source coro-
nal holes, we ﬁnd a distinct relationship to the co-latitude of their solar source coronal holes,

–3–

and interpret this result as a consequence of the three-dimensional propagation and expan-
sion of high-speed solar wind streams in the heliosphere.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes shortly the datasets used and

the data reduction performed, Section 3 performs the analysis. Section 4 presents the results:
Section 4.1 shows the dependency of the peak velocities of high-speed streams as measured
in the ecliptic at 1 AU on the area and solar latitude of their source coronal holes, and Section
4.2 the dependency of the Kp index on the area and solar latitude of the source coronal holes.
In Section 5 we discuss the results.

2 Datasets and Data Reduction

To determine the properties of the coronal holes, we use EUV 193 Å ﬁltergrams recorded

by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
[SDO; Lemen et al., 2012] and provided by the Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC;
http://jsoc.stanford.edu/), and EUV 195 Å ﬁltergrams recorded by the Extreme
UltraViolet Imagers (EUVI) on-board of the twin-satellites STEREO A and STEREO B
[STA; STB; Howard et al., 2008] and provided by the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO;
https://sdac.virtualsolar.org/cgi/search). The AIA 193 Å ﬁltergrams show the
emission from the Fe XII ions in the coronal plasma at a temperature of 1.6 MK (peak re-
sponse), and the EUVI 195 Å ﬁltergrams the emission from the Fe XII ions at a temperature
of 1.4 MK (peak response). All images were normalized to an exposure time of 1 s, rotated to
solar north, and rescaled to a spatial resolution of 2.4 arcsec/pixel by considering the conser-
vation of ﬂux.

To analyse the velocities of high-speed solar wind streams, we use in-situ solar wind

bulk velocity measurements from the Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor [SWEPAM;
McComas et al., 1998a] on-board of the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and pro-
vided by Caltech (http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/level2/index.html), and
in-situ solar wind bulk velocity measurements from the PLasma And Supra-Thermal Ion
Composition investigation [PLASTIC; Galvin et al., 2008] instrument on-board of STA and
STB and provided by the PLASTIC consortium (http://aten.igpp.ucla.edu/forms/stereo/level2_plasma_and_magnetic_field.html).
The SWEPAM-Ion instrument is a spherical section electrostatic energy per charge analyser,
measuring the energy of solar wind ions from 0.26 to 35 keV, which is dominated by solar
wind protons [McComas et al., 1998a]. Based on this data, Caltech provides a level 2 dataset
containing the absolute values of the hourly-averaged bulk solar wind speed. The PLASTIC
instrument is an electrostatic energy per charge and time-of-ﬂight analyser, measuring the
solar wind proton bulk parameters in an energy range from 0.3 to 10.6 keV.

For the study of the geomagnetic consequences of the Earth-directed high-speed streams,

we use the geomagnetic Kp-index. The Kp index is a measure of the disturbances of the hor-
izontal component of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld strength averaged over 13 observatories lo-
cated between 44 to 60° latitude [Bartels , 1949; Menvielle & Berthelier, 1991]. Here, we
use the Kp index as listed in the OMNI database (https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/dx1.html).

3 Methods

We manually selected 115 solar coronal holes and the corresponding high-speed so-
lar wind streams in the time range from 2010/08 to 2017/03. Note that we deﬁne every so-
lar wind stream arising from a coronal hole which produces a stream interaction region as a
high-speed solar wind stream. The criteria for choosing the events was that

•

•

the coronal holes show a well-deﬁned boundary as seen in the SDO/AIA-193, STA/EUVI-
195 and STB/EUVI-195 ﬁltergrams,
the coronal holes are isolated, i.e., that no other signiﬁcant coronal holes were in their
surrounding (Fig. A.1-A.3),

–4–

• and only one distinct peak appeared in the in-situ bulk solar wind velocity measure-
ments within 1.5 to 7 days after the center of mass of the coronal holes crossed the
central meridian.

Since for each event only one signiﬁcant coronal hole was at the solar central meridian and
only one distinct peak appeared in the velocity measurements in the time afterwards, these
coronal holes could be undoubtedly related to the in-situ measured high-speed solar wind
streams. Each of the events was re-checked manually by inspecting the solar wind bulk ve-
locity, proton density, proton temperature, and magnetic ﬁeld vector time lines and further
against the ICME lists of Richardson & Cane [2004] and Jian et al. [2013] in order to ex-
clude ICME events; the continuously updated ICME lists can be found at http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/DATA/level3/icmetable2.htm
and http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/~jlan/STEREO/Level3/STEREO_Level3_ICME.pdf.
Further, we re-checked each event whether the magnetic polarity of the high-speed solar
wind stream matches the magnetic polarity of its source coronal hole [Neugebauer et al.,
2002], whereby we presumed that the magnetic polarity of a coronal hole does not change in
its lifetime. In total, this dataset covers 115 of the 594 high-speed streams measured at ACE,
STEREO A, and STEREO B during the time range of interest.

We extracted the borders of the 115 coronal holes under study visually by applying an

intensity based thresholding technique on the AIA-193 and EUVI-195 EUV images based on
Rotter et al. [2012]. First, we corrected the EUV images for the EUV limb brightening due to
the increased optical depth by applying the annulus limb correction [Verbeeck et al., 2014].
Then, we extracted the coronal holes by the thresholding technique. Finally, a morphological
operator with a median kernel of 9 pixels was applied [Fig. 1a; Rotter et al., 2012]. For each
coronal hole, we derived its projection-corrected area ACH, and the latitude of its projection-
corrected center of mass ϕCH.

For each coronal hole selected, we manually assigned the peak velocity in the hourly-

averaged solar wind bulk velocity data in the time-range of 1.5 to 7 days after the centre
of mass of the coronal hole crossed the solar central meridian, and denote it as the peak
velocity of the corresponding high-speed solar wind stream vp (Fig. 1b). For the analysis
of the strength of geomagnetic storms, we assigned the peaks of the Kp index in the time-
range of −1.5 to 1 days around the times of the peak velocities of the high-speed streams
(Fig. 1d). Note that the SIRs created by the interaction of the high-speed solar wind streams
with the preceding slow solar winds are located in front of the high-speed streams (Fig. 1c)
[Belcher & Davis, 1971]. Therefore, the peaks in the Kp indices can already appear when
the corresponding SIRs sweeps over the Earth, and thus earlier than the peaks in the velocity
time lines of the high-speed streams.

The distribution of the solar coronal hole areas and high-speed stream peak velocities

at 1 AU versus the solar latitudes of the coronal holes are given in Figure 2. The EUV images
of all coronal holes selected are printed in Figures A.1-A.3, and the properties of the coronal
holes, high-speed solar wind streams and geomagnetic storms analysed are printed in Table
A.1.

4 Results

4.1 The Dependency of the High-Speed Solar Wind Stream Peak Velocities as
measured in the ecliptic at 1 AU on the Areas and Latitudes of their Solar
Source Coronal Holes

In this section, we show that the peak velocities of the high-speed solar wind streams
are dependent on the areas and the co-latitudes of their source coronal holes. We deﬁne the
co-latitude of the source coronal hole as the heliospheric latitudinal angle between the posi-
tion of the coronal hole and the position of the measuring satellite ϕco = ϕCH − ϕsat. Since all
the measuring satellites are in the ecliptic, ϕsat varies in the range of ≈ ± 7°.

–5–

Figure 3a shows the scatter plot of the peak velocities of the high-speed streams vp
versus the areas of the coronal holes ACH; the co-latitudes of the coronal holes are color-
coded. The well-known wide-scattered dependency between the coronal hole areas and the
high-speed stream peak velocities is visible, the Spearman’s correlation coeﬃcient rS is 0.50.
However, the color coding points to a further dependence on the co-latitude of the source
coronal hole.

In Figure 3b-e, we re-plot the coronal hole areas versus the high-speed stream peak
velocities separately for coronal holes located at co-latitudes between 0◦–15◦, 15◦–30◦, 30◦–
45◦, and > 45◦. In each of the panels, the peak velocities of high-speed streams increase with
increasing areas of their source coronal holes. In addition, the regression line of the ACH-
vp relationship is signiﬁcantly steeper for coronal holes with smaller co-latitudes, i.e., for
coronal holes located near the solar equator, than for coronal holes with large co-latitudes,
i.e., located at medium to high latitudes. This means that the peak velocities of high-speed
solar wind streams as observed in the ecliptic at 1 AU do not only depend on the area, but
further on the co-latitudes of their source coronal holes.

Next, we evaluate the relationship of the relative velocity increase per coronal hole area
(vp − voﬀset)/ACH as function of the co-latitude ϕco of the source coronal holes. First, we pre-
sume an oﬀset velocity voﬀset of 350 kms−1, and plot the relative velocity increase per area
versus the absolute co-latitudes of the coronal holes (Fig. 4a). It is clearly visible that the
relative velocity increase per coronal hole area depends on the co-latitude of the source coro-
nal hole, the corresponding Spearmans’s correlation coeﬃcient is rS = −0.67. The highest
relative velocity increase per area is obtained for coronal holes with small co-latitudes, i.e.,
located near the solar equator, and they statistically turn to zero at an absolute co-latitude of
≈60°. This means that a coronal hole of a given area causes the highest high-speed stream
peak velocity vp in the ecliptic at 1 AU when it is located at the solar equator, that the peak
velocity measured decreases linearly with increasing co-latitude of the source coronal hole,
and that vp/ACH even statistically turns to zero if the coronal hole is located at co-latitudes
& 60°.

In order to exclude that these results are dependent on the presumed oﬀset velocity

and on our manually selected dataset, we vary the presumed oﬀset velocity voﬀset from 300
to 500 kms−1, and calculate the corresponding Spearman’s correlation coeﬃcients and their
0.95 conﬁdence intervals by resampling the dataset 105 times with bootstrapping (Fig. 4b).
For oﬀset velocities <375 kms−1, the Spearman’s correlation coeﬃcient stays at a high level
of ≈ −0.67 at a conﬁdence interval of [−0.55, −0.77], and decreases down to −0.48 at a con-
ﬁdence interval of [−0.28, −0.60] for an oﬀset velocity of 500 kms−1. The decrease of the
correlation coeﬃcient for high oﬀset velocities is mainly due to the small coronal holes in the
dataset: when we exclude the smallest coronal holes with ACH < 3 · 1010 km2, we get a cor-
relation coeﬃcient of −0.61 at a conﬁdence interval of [−0.46, −0.73] for an oﬀset velocity
of 500 kms−1. Note that for all oﬀset velocities chosen, the relative velocity increase per area
turns to zero at an absolute co-latitude of ≈ 0.60◦ (not shown here).

As a further test, we examine the conﬁdence level with regard to whether the relative
velocity increase per area is really dependent on the co-latitude of the source coronal hole,
and not on its solar latitude. To do so, for each oﬀset velocity, we re-sampled the dataset
with bootstrapping 105 times. For each sample, we calculated the Spearman’s correlation
coeﬃcient between (1) the relative velocity increase per coronal hole area and the absolute
co-latitude of the coronal hole, between (2) the relative velocity increase per area and the
absolute solar latitude of the coronal hole, and (3) the diﬀerence of the absolute values of
these two correlation coeﬃcients. Then, the conﬁdence level is given by the relative num-
ber of the samples in which the diﬀerence of the absolute correlation coeﬃcients is positive,
i.e., in which the correlation with the co-latitude is higher than with the solar latitude. The
conﬁdence level and the mean Spearman’s correlation coeﬃcients for each oﬀset velocity
are plotted in Fig. 5. The red line shows that in 75 % to 95 % of the samples drawn, the ab-
solute co-latitude yields a better correlation with the relative velocity increase per area than

–6–

the absolute solar latitude. The black lines show that the mean diﬀerence in the Spearman’s
correlation coeﬃcients is about 0.04. Therefore, it is the co-latitude which aﬀects the peak
velocity of high-speed streams we measure in the ecliptic at 1 AU, and not the solar latitude
of the source coronal hole.

Finally, in order to quantify the peak velocity - area - latitude dependency, we ﬁt the
data using a least-square ﬁt and the approach vp = a + (b · ACH) · (1 − c · |ϕco|), and get:

vﬁt[kms−1] = 478 + (2.77 · 10−9 · ACH[km2]) · (1 − |ϕco[◦]| /61.4).

(1)

The ﬁrst term gives us the oﬀset velocity, the second term the relative velocity increase per
coronal hole area, and the third term a correction factor depending on the co-latitude of the
source coronal hole. In this ﬁt, the oﬀset velocity should be seen as a statistical best-ﬁt pa-
rameter without clear physical meaning. It does not correspond to the velocity of the slow
solar wind, and it does not mean that high-speed streams always have a minimum peak ve-
locity of 478 km/s. Further, note that corresponding to the ﬁt the relative velocity increase
per coronal hole area turns to zero when the co-latitude of the source coronal hole is 61.4°
with respect to the measuring satellite. In Figure 6a, we show the peak velocities calculated
by Equation 1 versus the peak velocities observed; the dashed line marks the one-to-one cor-
respondence. The data is well distributed around the one-to-one correspondence at a medium
scatter. The Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient of the calculated peak velocities to the mea-
sured peak velocities is cc = 0.70, the Spearman’s correlation coeﬃcient is rS = 0.72, the
mean absolute error (MAE) is 57 kms−1, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the cal-
culated to the measured peak velocities is 70 kms−1.

4.2 The Dependency of the Kp Index on the Area and Latitude of Coronal Holes

In this section, we show that the strength of geomagnetic storms induced by high-speed
solar wind streams are dependent on the areas and solar latitudes of the source coronal holes.
Note that here we can naturally use only events recorded by SDO and ACE; thus the dataset
decreases to 52 events.

Figure 7a shows the Kp index versus the area of the source coronal holes of the corre-

sponding high-speed solar wind streams, the co-latitude of the coronal holes are color-coded.
A dependency of the Kp index on the area of the coronal holes is not visible.

Again, we plot the co-latitude of the source coronal holes, ϕco, versus the Kp index per
coronal hole area, Kp/ACH (Fig. 7b). Here, a dependency on the co-latitude is clearly visible
at a medium scatter; the Spearman’s correlation coeﬃcient is −0.71 with a 0.95 conﬁdence
interval of [−0.55, −0.82]. Large Kp indices per coronal hole area mainly appear when the
source coronal hole is located near the solar equator, and get smaller with higher co-latitude
of the source coronal hole. This means that the geomagnetic storm caused by a high-speed
solar wind stream arising from a coronal hole with a given area is statistically stronger when
the coronal hole is located near the solar equator than at medium latitudes, and usually weak
if the coronal hole is located at higher latitudes.

5 Discussion and Conclusions

We investigated the dependence of the properties of solar coronal holes observed by
the satellites SDO, STEREO A, and STEREO B on the peak velocity of high-speed solar
wind streams as measured in-situ in the ecliptic at 1 AU by the satellites ACE, STEREO
A, and STEREO B, and the strength of their induced geomagnetic storms from 2010/08 to
2017/03. From a set of 115 solar coronal holes and corresponding high-speed solar wind
streams, and from a subset of 52 geomagnetic events for the Earth-directed high-speed solar
wind streams, we found that

–7–

1. the peak velocity of high-speed solar wind streams as measured in the ecliptic at 1 AU
depends linearly on both the co-latitude and the area of the solar source coronal hole:

vﬁt[kms−1] = 478 + (2.77 · 10−9 · ACH[km2]) · (1 − |ϕco[◦]| /61.4),

2. high-speed solar wind streams arising from solar coronal holes located near the eclip-
tic result in the highest solar wind peak velocities per coronal hole area in the ecliptic,
3. the high-speed stream velocity increase per coronal hole area statistically turns to zero

for coronal holes located at co-latitudes & 61.4°,

4. the Spearman’s correlation coeﬃcient between the high-speed stream velocity in-

creases per coronal hole areas and the co-latitudes of the source coronal holes is higher
than between the high-speed stream velocity increases per coronal hole areas and the
solar latitudes of the source coronal holes,

5. and that the Kp indices, i.e., the strength of geomagnetic storms induced by high-

speed solar wind streams, depend similarly on the areas and co-latitudes of the source
coronal holes.

Our ﬁndings are in agreement with the ﬁndings of Abramenko et al. [2009], who in-
vestigated the relation between the properties of 44 low-latitude coronal holes and the peak
velocities of high-speed solar wind streams at L1. Their resulting ﬁt gives

vp[km/s] = 486 + 8.5 · ACH[104arcsec2],

(2)

(3)

at a Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of 0.72 between the coronal hole areas and the peak ve-
locities. Further, our results agree well with the results from Karachik & Pevtsov [2011],
who investigated the dependency between the properties of 108 coronal holes distributed
over all latitudes and the solar wind peak velocities at L1. They found that the Pearson’s cor-
relation coeﬃcient between the area of coronal holes as measured in the image plane, Aip,
and the peak velocities is slightly higher (cc = 0.55) than the correlation coeﬃcient between
the projection-corrected areas and the peak velocities (cc = 0.50). Though, they did not use
explicitly a dependency on the solar latitude of the source coronal holes. Since the coronal
hole areas as measured in the image plane are related to the projection-corrected areas in the
form of

Aip ≈ ACH · cos(ϕCH),

their results yield implicitly a dependency of the peak velocities of high-speed streams on the
solar latitude of the source coronal holes. Our results also agree with Robbins et al. [2006],
who divided the solar disk into segments of 14° longitude and 30° latitude. They calculated
for each segment the fractional area covered by coronal holes, and correlated the fractional
areas of the segments within meridional slices with the solar wind speeds at L1 by a multi-
linear ﬁt. They found that the weight of segments near the solar equator is higher than the
weight of segments at higher latitudes, i.e., that a coronal hole with a given area results in
a faster high-speed solar wind stream at L1 when the coronal hole is located near the solar
equator than at higher latitudes. Due to the large size of their segments, they were not able to
determine the functional relationship to the solar latitude.

Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the well-known relationship between the areas of coronal holes
and the peak velocities of high-speed solar wind streams, but additionally quantify the de-
pendence on the co-latitudes of the measuring satellites relative to the positions of the source
coronal holes on the Sun. Certainly, the solar wind speed is aﬀected by various further pa-
rameters as the morphology of the coronal hole, which were not part of this study. In the
following, we give an interpretation to the dependency of the peak velocity of high-speed
streams as measured in the ecliptic at 1 AU and the geomagnetic Kp index on the co-latitudes
of the source coronal holes.

The dependence on the co-latitude of the source coronal holes we found may be related

to the three-dimensional propagation of high-speed solar wind streams in the heliosphere,
which was studied by the Ulysses satellite. During Ulysses’ fast-latitude scans, McComas et al.

[1998b] and McComas [2003] derived the latitudinal velocity proﬁle of two high-speed so-
lar wind streams arising from polar coronal holes. Thereby, McComas et al. [1998b] showed
that the velocity increased sharply from the low-latitudinal slow solar wind to the polar high-
speed solar wind stream, i.e., across the SIR, by ≈ 190 kms−1 over only ≈ 6° latitude. How-
ever, the velocity further increased by ≈ 170 kms−1 over a distance of ≈ 30° latitude inside
the high-speed stream towards its center. This means that the latitudinal velocity proﬁle in
the front of the high-speed solar wind stream, i.e. the two-dimensional plane in the high-
speed stream parallel to the high-speed stream - SIR interface, is not ﬂat. Further, McComas
[2003] showed that the polar high-speed solar wind stream extended down to heliospheric
latitudes of only ≈ 55 − 70° strongly depending on the boundary of the polar coronal hole,
i.e., it missed the Earth.

First, let us presume that in general high-speed streams propagate radially away from

the Sun in three dimensions and thereby expand. In general, we expect the highest high-
speed stream velocities in the center of the high-speed stream front, and lower velocities in
the ﬂanks of the high-speed stream. Thus, when the source coronal hole is located in the
ecliptic, then the center of the corresponding high-speed stream will also propagate in the
ecliptic towards our measuring satellite, and we will measure the peak velocity in the center
of the high-speed stream, i.e., its maximum velocity. However, when the source coronal hole
is located at medium solar latitudes, then the center of the corresponding high-speed stream
will propagate radially away from the Sun towards medium heliospheric latitudes, and in the
ecliptic we will only measure the ﬂank of the high-speed stream resulting in lower peak ve-
locities. The exact high-speed stream peak velocity we measure is therefore determined by
the exact latitudinal position of the satellites within the high-speed stream front, which is
given by the angle between the satellite and the radial propagation direction of the center of
the high-speed stream. This angle equals the co-latitude we deﬁned, i.e., the latitudinal angle
between the measuring satellite and the solar source coronal hole. Note that this interpreta-
tion is supported by the results of McComas et al. [1998b] and McComas [2003] described
above. It is further supported by the fact that the peak velocities per coronal hole area are al-
ways correlated better with the co-latitude of the source coronal holes than with their solar
latitudes, which means that the heliospheric latitudinal distance of the measuring satellite to
the source coronal hole is the relevant parameter.

If our interpretation is correct, the functional dependence of the high-speed stream

peak velocities on the co-latitudes of the source coronal should apply for all empirical rela-
tionships between high-speeds stream peak velocities and coronal hole parameters, in par-
ticular for relationships regarding the coronal hole area, the coronal hole brightness [e.g.
Obridko et al., 2009], and the inverse ﬂux tube expansion factor [e.g. Wang & Sheeley, 1990].

The same interpretation is valid for the dependence of the Kp index on the co-latitude

and area of the coronal hole. The co-latitude determines the position of Earth in the high-
speed stream front, and thus also its geomagnetic consequence. When a coronal hole of a
given area is located at the ecliptic, directly looking towards the Earth, we can expect the
Earth to be directly hit by the high-speed stream with stronger geomagnetic consequences;
when it is located at higher latitudes, the Earth will be farer out in the ﬂanks of the high-
speed stream and only be grazed. When a coronal hole is located at high latitudes & 61.4°,
the corresponding high-speed solar wind stream will eventually even not expand down to the
ecliptic near Earth and thus miss the Earth.
