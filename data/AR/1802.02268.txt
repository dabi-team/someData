Abstract 
The choice of reference for the electroencephalogram (EEG) is a long-lasting unsolved issue resulting in 
inconsistent usages and endless debates. Currently, both the average reference (AR) and the reference 
electrode standardization technique (REST) are two primary, apparently irreconcilable contenders. We 
propose  a  theoretical  framework  to  resolve  this  reference  issue  by  formulating  both  a)  estimation  of 
potentials at infinity, and, b) determination of the reference, as a unified Bayesian linear inverse problem, 
which  can  be  solved  by  penalized  maximum  likelihood  inference.  We  find  that  AR  and  REST  are  very 
particular cases of this unified framework: AR results from biophysically non-informative prior; while REST 
utilizes the prior based on the EEG generative model. To allow for simultaneous denoising and reference 
estimation, we develop the regularized versions of AR and REST, named rAR and rREST, respectively. Both 
depend  on  a  regularization  parameter  that  is  the  noise  to  signal  variance  ratio.  Traditional  and  new 
estimators  are  evaluated  with  this  framework,  by  both  simulations  and  analysis  of  real  resting  EEGs. 
Towards this end, we leverage the MRI and EEG data from 89 subjects which participated in the Cuban 
Human Brain Mapping Project. Generated artificial EEGs—with a known ground truth, show that relative 
error in estimating the EEG potentials at infinity is lowest for rREST. It also reveals that realistic volume 
conductor models improve the performances of REST and rREST. Importantly, for practical applications, it 
is shown that an average lead field gives the results comparable to the individual lead field. Finally, it is 
shown that the selection of the regularization parameter with Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) is close 
to the ‘oracle’ choice based on the ground truth. When evaluated with the real 89 resting state EEGs, 
rREST consistently yields the lowest GCV. This study provides a novel perspective to the EEG reference 
problem by means of a unified inverse solution framework. It may allow additional principled theoretical 
formulations and numerical evaluation of performance. 

1. Introduction 
The human  electroencephalogram (EEG) has  been  an  indispensable technology  for both  cognitive  and 
clinical neuroscience for almost 90 years. Ultrahigh temporal resolution, low cost, and noninvasiveness 
single it out as a translational tool of choice to study the brain. Nevertheless, two main drawbacks of EEG 
detract from its ability to localize the brain activity: i) spatial blurring due to volume conduction, ii) the 
inherent indeterminacy of potentials measurements which are always carried out with respect to a given 
reference (Teplan, 2002). Spatial blurring is being addressed by advanced source imaging techniques that 
however  will  not  be  the  focus  of  our  attention.  We  will  rather  concentrate  on  the  vexing  and  still 
incompletely resolved ‘EEG reference problem’. To precisely define this issue, we note that it is due to the 
intrinsic nature of EEG recordings that are the measurement of potential differences between two sites 
shown  in  Figure  1.  Ideally,  one  would  like  to  record  the  potentials  of  an  ‘active  electrode’  that  is  only 

1 

 
picking up the activities due to a few brain structures in comparison to a neutral ‘reference electrode’ 
with zero activity. One might think that such a reference electrode could be placed at infinity, yielding the 

ideal potentials 

. However, this would not work in practice, since this configuration would serve as an 

antenna,  picking  unwanted  activity  from  the  environment.  Some  researchers  therefore  experimented 
with  reference  electrode  placed  on  the  body  so  that  EEG  differential  amplimers  could  eliminate 
environmental noise with high common mode rejection ratio. Unfortunately, because there is no neutral 
or inactive point upon the body, these proposals are also inadequate. A physical neutral reference seems 
therefore out of our reach. 

However,  the  non-neutrality  of  the  reference  has  consequences  cascading  through  the  following 
processing  stages,  including  the  final  statistical  result.  In  view  of  the  failures  of  physical  references, 
attention was turned to the construction of ‘virtual’ estimators of the neutral references, namely, virtual 

estimators of 

. 

One popular virtual estimator is the ‘average reference’ (AR, Figure 1(d)), which based on the following 
logic: i) the integral of the electrical potential  over a sphere, due to a current source inside it,  is zero 
(Goldman, 1950;  Offner, 1950),  ii)  the  head  can  be  approximated  as a  sphere.  iii)  therefore,  a  neutral 
reference  may  be  obtained  by  summing  or  averaging  the  activities  of  all  electrodes.  Re-referencing 
proceeds by subtracting this average from all channels. Unfortunately, recent work (Yao, 2017) has shaken 
the theoretical foundation of AR: the potential integral for a realistic head surface is not zero. 

Figure  1,  EEG  reference  problem.  EEG  recordings  measure  the  potential  differences  between  active  electrodes 
marked in yellow (only 3 for illustration) and reference marked in red which may be (a) a point at infinity, (b) an 
electrode placed on the body, e.g. the base of neck, (c) the cephalic reference (here, Cz), (d) average reference --- 
the mean of potentials over all active electrodes. All reference techniques (b)-(d) attempt to approximate infinity 
reference in (a). The issue is that the all proposals results in different EEG waveforms originating the ‘EEG reference

problem’. It should be noted that with the identical source activities 

,  the different waveforms (

, 

, 

, 

) could be taken as well as the outcome of different lead fields (

, 

, 

, 

). 

A  more  biophysically-based  virtual  estimator  of 

 can  be  obtained  by  the  reference  electrode 

standardization technique (REST, Figure 2) which directly estimates the ideal potentials referenced to a 
point at infinity (Yao, 2001). REST uses a head model and equivalent sources to localize source activities, 
then project the source activities to electrodes — now with reference to infinity. Early work on REST was 
based upon a simple spherical head model. It was soon shown that EEG power maps (Yao et al., 2005), 
ERP peak values and latencies (Li and Yao, 2007) did, in fact, critically depend on the choice of reference. 
In a further study, it was shown (Tian and Yao, 2013) that scalp statistical parametric mapping with REST 
for audiovisual stimulus evoked potentials provided closer correspondence to the source localization by 
low  resolution  electromagnetic  tomography  than  that  with  AR.  These  encouraging  results  about  REST 
have  been  bolstered  by  several  simulation  experiments.  Using  a  spherical  head  model  for  simulation, 
(Marzetti et al., 2007; Qin et al., 2010) indicated that REST led to better estimates of EEG spectra and 
coherence than AR. Several papers unsurprisingly showed that realistic head model for REST gives superior 
results  for  the  reconstruction  of  simulated  EEG  scalp  topographies  (Liu  et  al.,  2015),  functional 
connectivity (Chella et al., 2016) and bispectral analysis (Chella et al., 2017).

In spite of these suggestive results in favor of REST, there is still an intense and to a certain extent 
unresolved  debate  on  which  reference  is  preferable  (Kulaichev,  2016;  Nunez,  2010b).  The  lack  of 
resolution is due to that simulation studies, while useful, are not enough to demonstrate the superiority 
of one reference technique over another. In addition to simulations, the evidence is needed on which 
reference achieves the ‘best fit’ to actual data’. The choice of the best model is a well-studied problem in 
modern  statistics  (Christian  P.  Robert,  2007)  and  can  be  resolved  by  model  selection  criteria  that 
approximates  the  Bayesian  model  evidence  (Konishi  and  Kitagawa,  2008).  However,  to  apply  these

techniques, an explicit Bayesian model of the ‘EEG reference problem’ must be stated. Thus, one of the 
primal goals for this study is to uncover a unified estimator of EEG reference at infinity.  

In  the  current  study,  we  formulate,  to  our  best  knowledge  for  the  first  time,  the  ‘EEG  reference 
problem’ as a generalized Bayesian inverse problem. One surprising consequence of this approach is the 
insight that AR and REST share the same model and just differ in the prior distribution for the covariance 
of EEG potentials at infinity. On the one hand, assuming uncorrelated activities over electrodes leads to 
the AR estimator. On the other hand, if the correlations between electrodes are assumed to be caused by 
sources filtered through a volume conductor model, the resulting estimator is REST.  

Our theoretical formulation will allow us to examine different reference estimators within a common 
statistical framework. We note that the REST estimator (Yao, 2001) was originally defined for high S/N 
ratios. In some situations, this might be unrealistic, since the scalp EEG may have quite low signal to noise 
ratio  (Bigdely-Shamlo  et  al.,  2015;  Ferree  et  al.,  2001;  Guruvareddy,  2013;  Lemm  et  al.,  2006).  Our 
framework allows using regularization technique as a way to accommodate noise in the data (Phillips et 
al., 2002, 2005). The regularized version of REST is developed which we all ‘rREST’. It is evident that a 
regularized version of AR is also possible, which we term as ‘rAR’. AR and REST are just the special cases 
of rAR and rREST when regularization parameter tends to zero, respectively. 

We further investigate the effect of the volume conduction model on rREST. To avoid the ‘inverse 
crime’  (Kaipio  and  Somersalo,  2007),  the  volume  conduction  model  used  in  the  simulation  should  be 
different with the one used to generate EEG potentials. We call this ‘volume conduction model matching 
problem’ for REST that may produce the spurious results in simulation. Although equivalent source models 
are used for REST in simulation, the volume conduction model matching problem still cannot be neglected 
(Hu et al., 2017). Within this framework and using extensive simulations, the performances of AR, REST, 

rAR  and  rREST  are  compared  in  terms  of  the  relative  error of  estimation  of 

.  Additionally,  in  these 

simulations, we explore the performances of the model selection criteria for selecting the regularization 
parameter. 

Finally, we assess their performances of all the estimators using real EEG data from 89 subjects with 

both regularization and volume conduction matching problem tested exhaustively.

2.1. General reference model 
The EEG is always recorded with respect to a time-varying reference. This is usually modeled as a constant 
subtracted from all electrodes at each instant. In the general case, we can consider that there are two 
separate reference constants, one for the scalp EEG signal, and another for the sensor noise (if they come 
from distinctly different source). In this case, the online recorded EEG signal at a given instant is modeled 
as

Table  1  shows  that  both  AR  and  REST  are  special  cases  of  rAR  and  rREST  if  either  the  sensor  noise  is 
supposed  to  be  zero  or  no  regularization  is  applied.  In  this  section,  after  transforming  the  general 
reference model into the standard ridge regression form, we evaluate the references via statistical model 
selection criteria.

Under  the  standard  ridge  regression  form  (12)explore  three  information  criteria  for  the  model 
selection: generalized cross-validation (GCV), Akaike information criteria (AIC), and Bayesian information 
criteria  (BIC)  to  compare  the  reference  schemes  in  Table  1.  To  apply  these,  we  define  the  degree  of 
freedom (DF) as the degree of freedom (DF) as 

where

. Since EEG reference acts as adding or subtracting a time-varying 

constant over all sensors at each instant, this instantaneous effect results in the dynamical alteration in 
the temporal domain. To investigate the difference of references, we extend the model selection criteria 

from single instant to the whole recording, approximately. Predefining

3.3. Regularization parameter 
The regularization parameter 
 balances the goodness of fitting (i.e. likelihood) and the prior constraint 
on  the  EEG  potentials  at  infinity.  One  may  try  to  interactively  estimate  the  hierarchal  Bayesian 
hyperparameter via iteration (MacKay, 1992; Trujillo-Barreto et al., 2004). However, this may work for 
rREST but poorly for rAR because the noise term will be assimilated into the pure EEG signal in  (6) the 
uncorrelated covariance prior. Namely, the objective function of AR is nonconvex and it cannot converge 
to a global or local optimal point. Thus, we adopt a search strategy to explore how DF, GCV, AIC and BIC 
as well as GCV, AIC and BIC against DF. In

, we thus only generate 

1000 values of

from 1e-3.5 to 1e-1 for rREST, and 1e-3 to 10 for rAR, by using sampled logarithm. 

In the simulation, we can evaluate the reference estimators with an ‘oracle’ regularization parameter, 
namely, one for which the smallest relative error regarding the ground truth. Additionally, the efficiency 
of the model selection criteria (GCV, AIC and BIC) for selecting the regularization parameter is evaluated. 
 with actual EEG data where the ground truth is unknown. The value 
It will be trickier to find a proper 
with which one model selection criteria reaches to a global or local minimum is regarded as the optimal 

 chosen by the model selection criteria for actual EEG data. 
It has been suggested to avoid regularization when applying REST so as not to lose high-frequency 
information (Yao, 2001). Instead, a truncation of singular value decomposition (TSVD) was proposed to 
suppress the effect of sensor noise for REST (Zhai and Yao, 2004). Therefore, we empirically adopt the 
recommended truncation parameter 0.05 for REST but use the model selection criteria for rREST. 
3.4. Regularization matrix 
The  choice  of  regularization  matrix

 depends  on  the  prior  covariance  structure  of  the  potentials  at

 are: 

       for AR and rAR, 

for REST and rREST,

Several cases of 

 are detailed in the next section. The degree of faithful biophysical regularization by 

 increases from the less realistic approximation of volume conductor to the more realistic one. 

3.5. Volume conduction model 
For rREST, we study the volume conduction model matching problem, that is, to what extent, the lead 
field for rREST may be different from the actual one that generated the simulated EEG data or the real 
EEG recordings. Here, we evaluate several types of lead fields. The well-known spherical lead field (SLF) is 
a frequently adopted standard lead field. The most precise volume conduction model is the individual lead

field (ILF) matched to the structural Magnetic Resonance Image (sMRI) of each subject. We also evaluate 
the average lead field (ALF) as a substitute for the individual lead field. Finally, we evaluate the ‘sparse 
individual lead field’ (sILF) for which we switch off the voxels not used in the simulations. We will use 
suffixes to distinguish between types of lead fields. 

Spherical lead field (SLF) 

, is estimated based on the standard 3-layers concentric spherical head 

model comprising of brain, skull, and scalp with the conductivities being 1, 0.0125 and 1, respectively. For 
the spherical head shape, the radii are 1.0, 0.92 and 0.87 for the scalp surface, outer and inner skull surface, 
separately. The source space consists of 2600 discrete dipole sources evenly and radially distributed on 
the cortical surface with radius r = 0.86 and 400 discrete dipole sources uniformly located perpendicularly 
to the transverse plane with Z = - 0.076 (for the coordinates in detail, refer to (Hu et al., 2017; Yao, 2001)). 

Individual lead field (ILF) 

, is defined by normalization as  

where 

 is the raw individual lead field matched to the 

 subject who underwent the 

EEG recording in Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project (CHBMP) (Bosch-Bayard et al., 2012; Hernandez-
Gonzalez et  al., 2011; Uludağ et al., 2009; Valdés-Hernández et al., 2010). It is  estimated by the  finite 
element  method  based  on  the  segmented  cortical  surface  through  CIVET  pipeline  (Ad-Dab’bagh,  Y., 
Lyttelton, O., Muehlboeck, J. S., Lepage, C., Einarson, D., Mok, K., ... & Evans, 2006) with sMRI. The cortical 
surface is formed by 6003 vertices and 11998*3 faces. In total, 6003 dipole sources are located at the 
vertices and activated perpendicularly to the cortical surface, individually. The normalization allows for 
comparison across subjects.

of 89 subjects from the CHBMP database, we generated the EEG dataset 89 samples by 58 channels by 
5120 instants. The simulation provides the ground truth of EEG potentials with the neutral reference, thus 
making it possible to intuitively compare the performances of references in terms of the relative error of 
potentials. The relative error (RE) of potentials is defined as

where

 is the EEG potentials estimated by the references in Table 1. 

4.2. Relative error of reference estimators 
For each data sample (58 channels by 5120 instants), the relative error (RE) of potentials is calculated by 
using (19).  Figure 4(a)-(d) show the REs of the reference estimators, including the lead fields variants (SLF, 
ILF, ALF, and sILF) for REST and rREST, with SNR=20dB, 8dB, 4dB, 2dB, respectively. Boxplots in black, green, 
red, and blue, show the REs of AR, rAR, REST and rREST, separately. It is evident from the boxplots (a)-(d), 
that the REs of regularized references (rAR, rREST) are always less than that of unregularized references 
(AR, REST). Unpaired t-tests were applied to check the differences between unregularized references (AR, 
REST) and regularized references (rAR, rREST). Figure 4(e) lists the statistical significance levels (p values) 
between AR and rAR, as well as between REST and rREST with various lead fields tested, separately. Except 
for the case between AR and rAR with SNR=20dB, the p-values all reach very small values (<1e-7). 

With regularization, the decreases of REs from REST to rREST are more obvious than the decreases of 
REs from AR to rAR. Especially, regularization with sILF is much more efficient than SLF, ILF, and ALF. This 
is not  surprising  since the sparse prior information was incorporated into the covariance structure. By 
contrast, by the simplest volume conduction model, i.e. SLF, the REs of  rREST seems to be even larger 
than  that  of  AR,  and  REST  performs  the  worst  among  all  the  references,  when  SNR  =  20dB  and  8dB. 
Comparing the REs by sILF and that of rREST by SLF with the REs of REST by SLF, we found that structure 
regularization  by  precise  covariance  seems  to  be  more  efficient  than  the  parameter  regularization  by 
 .  And  the  REs  of  rREST  with  sILF  are  the  least  among  all  the  REs  of  other 
selecting  the  optimal 
references. This means that structure regularization together with parameter regularization will have the 
best effect. In addition, injecting higher sensor noise with SNR being from 20dB to 2dB, the REs of rAR 

10 

rv[0,,0,1]TfjirawKirawK22ˆREFFφφφφˆφ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase from less than 15% to higher than 60% accordingly, while the REs of  rREST with SLF excluded 
goes from 4.1% to 40%. 

Figure 4, Relative error (RE) of reference estimators. (a) – (d), the boxplots of REs with SNR = 20dB, 8dB, 4dB and 
2dB, respectively. Volume conduction model tested for REST and rREST are spherical lead field (SLF), individual lead 
field (ILF), average lead field (ALF), and sparse individual lead field (sILF). (e) the p-values of REs between ordinary 
references (AR, REST) and regularized references (rAR, rREST) under different SNR and various lead fields, separately. 

These results indicate that: 1) except for the case of AR and rAR with SNR=20dB, AR, rAR, REST and 
rREST by using SLF that roughly approximated the actual volume conduction model may be not able to 
reconstruct  the  EEG  signal  at  infinity  due  to  the  quite  large  REs;  2)  the effects  of  REST and  rREST  are 
volume conduction model dependent; 3) Stronger regularization applied, better effect of rREST obtained; 
4) for REST and rREST, the REs by using ALF seems to be almost same with the REs by ILF; 5) rAR may not 
have the effect of denoising. Over all, AR and rAR may be the alternative option when SNR is very large 
(>=20dB), while rREST with precise volume conduction model should be the first option to estimate the 
EEG signal at infinity.

4.3. Model selection for estimators with simulated data 
The results summarized in Figure 5 allow determining the optimal reference via the model selection criteria. 
The curves in (a) show how the degree of freedom (DF) and Generalized Cross Validations (GCV) vary with 
 (i.e. LMD), as well as how the residual sum square (RSS) changes with DF. 
the regularization parameter 
It is easy to see that the DF of rREST are always smaller than the DF of rAR. This means that rREST adopts 
the simpler model to reconstruct the EEG signal at infinity but employ the more realistic prior information 
for regularization than rAR. The lower RSS of rREST than rAR indicate that the EEG signal reconstructed by 
rREST is closer to the truth compared with the EEG signal restored by rAR. The curves in (b) display how 
the model selection criteria, GCV, AIC and BIC vary with the DF. Apparently, the model selection criteria 
values of rREST are always smaller than them of rAR. The prevalent lower values of model selection criteria 
provide the evidence to prefer rREST over rAR.

4.4. Regularization parameter  
For rREST, it is crucial to pick the best regularization parameter, i.e. the value of 
.  Figure 6 displays that, 
 selected by the model selection criteria (GCV, AIC and BIC) are close to the 
to what extent, the values of 
truth. Comparing the mean relative error (mRE) and the standard deviations in (b)-(d) with those in (a), 
GCV is easily found as the best one to select the proper regularization parameter due to the almost same 
mRE and standard deviations to the truth; AIC is worse than GCV since except for the rREST by using sILF, 
the regularized reference (rAR, rREST) show the same or larger mRE and standard deviations than the 
ordinary reference (AR, REST); BIC is the worst one to select the proper regularization parameters because

5. Model selection for estimators with real data 
We take the EEG of 89 subjects from the CHBMP database to evaluate the reference estimators. The EEG 
recordings were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Ethics committees of Ministry of 
Public health and Cuban Neuroscience Center with written informed consent from all subjects. The EEG 
was acquired with 58 channels, 10-10 electrode placement system, sampling rate 200Hz, recording period 
2.5-5 mins, and with the resting-state of ‘eyes-closed-open’ intermittently conditioned. Figure 7 displays a 
real EEG data sample. To compare the performance of references over all subjects, we normalize the EEG 
data by 

The model selection criteria GCV, AIC, and BIC are calculated for each subject with the matched ILF, 

sILF, the identical ALF and SLF. The mean model selection criteria are averaged over 89 subjects.

To validate the  preference of  rREST over  rAR, a similar analysis as  descried  before for simulations 
regarding performance is now applied to the realistic resting state EEG datasets of 89 subjects from the 
CHBMP  database.  The  results  in  Figure  8  show  how  the  degree  of  freedom (DF)  and  generalized  cross 
 (i.e. LMD) and how the residual sum square 
validation (GCV) change with the regularization parameter 

14 

 
 
 
 and the limits of regularization parameter 

(RSS) and model selection criteria (GCV, AIC, and BIC) vary with the DF. Since the reference transformation 
matrix 
 (i.e. LMD) are the same as that in simulation, the 
curves of DF against LMDs in Figure 8 (a) are identical to them in Figure 5 (a). The lower RSS and model 
selection criteria curves in Figure 8 (b) confirm, for real data, our previous findings in simulations, namely, 
that 1) the EEG signal reconstructed by rREST has lower RSS than that restored by rAR; 2) rREST has the 
smaller values of GCV, AIC, and BIC than rAR, except for the almost same BIC between rREST and  rAR 
around DF = 28. Due to that GCV is found to be the best to pick the proper regularization parameter 
 in 
 in practice when the ground truth is unknown. 
Figure 6, we suggest adopting GCV to select the value of 
The curves in the middle of Figure 8 (a) shows how GCV varies with the values of 
 (i.e. LMDs). For rREST, 
the  global  minimum  of  GCV  occurs  around  =  1e-2 or  about  DF  =  10.  This means  that  for  a  group of 
subjects, we are able to find the best regularization parameter by the lowest GCV. By contrast, GCV of rAR 
seems to be one constant. In other words, the solution of rAR is a nonconvex solution where it is hard to 
find the proper 
 These results indicate that the preference of rREST over rAR is validated for real EEG. 
Moreover,  for  rREST.  the  best  regularization  parameter  can  be  picked  at  the  global  minimum  of  GCV 
curves. 

6. Discussion 
Although the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) was put forward some time ago, its 
theoretical  underpinnings  have  not  been  deeply  studied,  particularly  from  a  mathematical  statistics 
perspective.  Prior  to  REST,  the  average  reference  (AR)  had  been  broadly  adopted,  e.g.  in  microstates 
analysis (Khanna et al., 2015). Currently, both AR and REST are the main competing estimators (Nunez, 
2010b).  Many  comparative  studies  have  been  carried  out,  however,  without  providing  the  definitive 
evidence to prefer one over another (Chella et al., 2016, 2017; Lei and Liao, 2017; Qin et al., 2010). The 
need to settle this issue has been reinforced recently by the theoretical results of Yao, who demonstrated 
that  the  main  assumption  of  AR  —  the  cancellation  of  brain  potentials  averaged  over  the  scalp  is,  in 
general,  false  (Yao,  2017).  However,  it  is  difficult  to  decide  the  reference  issue  solely  the  biophysical 
interpretations. Empirical verification of the best reference using a full statistical model is also essential. 
In this study, we propose to view the estimation of the potentials at infinity and the determination of 
reference as a linear inverse problem that can be attacked using well known Bayesian techniques. To our 
surprise, both AR and REST are two special cases with different prior distributions for the covariance of 
the EEG potentials referenced to infinity. By explicitly introduced the sensor noise term into the reference 
model, we combined the estimation of the potentials at infinity with denoising. The formulation, based 
on penalized maximum likelihood, leads to the regularized estimators, rAR and rREST. Finally, recognizing 
that  the  reference  is  a  linear  inverse  problem  leads  to  the  use  of model  selection  criteria  to  examine 
several issues. It is found, for both simulated and actual data, that 1) regularization is critical to solving 
the  reference  problem  and  denoising  simultaneously;  2)  the  regularized  reference  (rAR/  rREST)  has  a 
better performance than the ordinary reference (AR/REST), respectively; 3) rREST outperforms REST, 4) 
to apply rREST to real EEG data, generalized cross-validation is recommended as an effective measure to 
select the optimal regularization parameter. In our opinion, the definitive argument in favor of rREST is 
that for 89 resting state EEGs it provides a smaller Generalized Cross Validation. This is the first empirical 
comparison of references using an information criterion that approximates the Bayesian model evidence. 
REST  has  attracted  attention  due  to  its  theoretically  sound  basis  (Kayser  and Tenke, 2010;  Nunez, 
2010a; Yao, 2001). However, some studies with ordinary REST suggest that it does not uniformly dominate 
AR (Hu et al., 2017; Yao, 2001). Though ordinary REST was found to be more efficient than AR for vertically 

15 

H. 
oriented and shallow dipole sources, this was not so for transverse or deep dipoles. Our results give a 
different perspective. We suggest these findings were due to two factors which are from both a spherical 
volume conductor model, as well as limiting sources to the equivalent distributed dipoles layer (Yao and 
He, 2003), i.e. the sources over the 2D cortical sheet with radial orientation (Yao, 2001), to derive the 
covariance  structure  for ordinary  REST.  By  contrast,  we  tested  here  more  realistic  volume  conduction 
models. Also, our simulations were  based on multiple cortical patches.  Our results  indicate  that more 
realistic the volume conductor and source space is, the better the estimator of the reference, and that in 
fact, REST does dominate AR in all cases. 

We emphasize multi-possibilities of source modeling and restate the conception of the generalized 
inverse problem. As REST is a generalized inverse solution, the multipole sources (Daunizeau et al., 2006) 
and the general 3D distributed sources at each grid of brain volume (Michel et al., 2004) can be also be 
adopted for REST as well (Yao, 2000). We have shown that all generalized inverses are not equal and an 
interesting line of research will be to explore how different source model procedures can be translated 
into variants of REST.  

The importance of an adequate volume conduction model matching test showed that REST and rREST 
is volume conduction model dependent. This is in agreement with the findings of Hu, et al (Hu et al., 2017) 
and Quanying, et al (Liu et al., 2015). Quanying, et al reported that a realistic volume conduction model is 
critical to ordinary REST. Hu, et al stated that ordinary REST is volume conduction model dependent but 
imprecise or slightly perturbated lead fields does not deteriorate ordinary REST much. This is agreement 
with our simulation results that showed that better estimates of both the volume conductor and source 
extent lead to better reference estimates. 

However, it is computational costly to estimate the individual lead field and is essential to have the 
subject’s sMRI—something not usual in many clinical settings. The excellent performance of the average 
lead field almost achieves the same performance as obtained with the more exact individual lead field. 
This validates the proposal that approximate head models without individual MRI data can be quite useful 
(Valdés-Hernández et al., 2009). 

Main contributions of this paper are: 
1) We propose that reference estimation is a unified Bayesian linear inverse problem. 
2)  This  framework  explicitly  models  sensor  noise  as a  part  of  the  EEG  generative  model.  It  allows 
denoising together with reference estimation. 
3)  AR  and  REST  are  shown  to  be  the  special  cases  of  the  linear  inverse  problem,  with  a  spatially 
uncorrelated prior for AR and a spatially correlated prior for REST (resulting from volume conduction 
of sources). 
4)  Regularized  estimators,  rAR  and  rREST,  are  developed  to  implement  reference  estimation  and 
denoising simultaneously. 
5) We adopted the model selection criteria (GCV, AIC, BIC) for not only to select the hyperparameter 
but also to compare model families. GCV was found to be the most useful indicator. 
6) We propose the average lead field as a practical substitute for the individual lead field to construct 
near optimal estimators.  

Several extensions of this study are being explored: 
•  Artifact  suppression  may  be  incorporated  together  with  reference  estimation  and  denoising.  For 
example,  outliers can be  eliminated by  utilizing  a likelihood function designed for  robust  statistics 
(Huber and Ronchetti, 2009). 

16 

 
•  More biophysical information may be built into the prior distributions to more effectively differentiate 
the pure EEG signal from the sensor noise. Particularly, covariance matrices corresponding to different 
types of structured sparsity source models should be examined (Paz-Linares et al., 2017). 

•  We have dealt only with spatial priors for the covariance matrix of the EEG. Dynamical priors can easily 
be incorporated. Temporal autocorrelations may be modeled as state space models and estimated 
via  the  Kalman  filter  (Galka  et  al.,  2004).  Alternatively,  formulations  for  the  frequency,  or  time 
frequency domain are possible. 

•  The framework may be also extended to event related potentials incorporating prior work from our 

group in this direction (Carbonell et al., 2004). 

7. Conclusion 
We  state  the  EEG  reference  problem  as  a  unified  inverse  problem  that  can  be  solved  via  Bayesian 
techniques. To our best knowledge, this is a novel approach to the problem. This formulation allows us to: 

•  Adopt regularization methods to estimate the potential referenced to infinity. 
•  Demonstrate that REST and AR can be are the special cases of the unified estimator with different EEG 

spatial covariance priors 

•  Simultaneously carry out denoising as part of the estimation procedure 
•  Use  model  selection  criteria  to  determine  the  optimal  reference  estimator.  These  results  can  be 

summarized as:  

o  Regularized references (rREST or  rAR) are  superior to the ordinary REST or AR, with rREST 

having the overall best performance for both simulations and real data. 

o  The optimal choice of volume conductor model is the individual or averaged lead field. 

Regularized  REST  (rREST) may  be  used  in  clinical  settings,  as  an  improved  estimator of  EEG  potentials 
referenced to infinity.
