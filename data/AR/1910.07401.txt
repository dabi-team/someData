ABSTRACT
We apply the standard radio pulsar rotating vector model to the white dwarf pulsar AR Sco’s optical
polarization position angle swings folded at the white dwarf’s spin period as obtained by Buckley et al.
(2017). Owing to the long duty cycle of spin pulsations with a good signal-to-noise ratio over the entire
spin phase, in contrast to neutron star radio pulsars, we ﬁnd well-constrained values for the magnetic
obliquity α and observer viewing direction ζ with respect to the spin axis. We ﬁnd cos α = 0.060+0.050
−0.053
and cos ζ = 0.49+0.09
−6.0◦ . This
orthogonal nature of the rotator is consistent with the optical light curve consisting of two pulses per
spin period, separated by 180◦ in phase. Under the assumption that ζ
i, where i is the orbital
inclination, and a Roche-lobe-ﬁlling companion M star, we obtain mWD = 1.00+0.16
−0.10M⊙ for the white
dwarf mass. These polarization modeling results suggest the that non-thermal emission arises from
a dipolar white dwarf magnetosphere and close to the star, with synchrotron radiation (if non-zero
pitch angles can be maintained) being the plausible loss mechanism, marking AR Sco as an exceptional
system for future theoretical and observational study.

AR Scorpii (AR Sco) is an intriguing binary system
containing a putative white dwarf (WD) with an M-
dwarf companion. The system exhibits pulsed non-
thermal radio, optical, and X-ray emission,
likely of
synchrotron radiation (SR) origin (Marsh et al. 2016;
Buckley et al. 2017; Takata et al. 2018). AR Sco has
a binary orbital period of Pb = 3.56 hours, a WD
spin period of P = 1.95 minutes, and a beat period
of 1.97 minutes. The light cylinder radius1 and or-
1011 cm and
bital separation are RLC = c/Ω
1010 cm, respectively, with Ω the spin angular
a
frequency. Thus, the M star is located within the WD’s
magnetosphere at a
0.13RLC. A change in spin pe-
riod ˙P = 3.9
10−13 s s−1 was inferred by Marsh et al.
(2016) but was disputed by Potter & Buckley (2018a)
who argued that the observations were too sparse to de-
rive an accurate spin-down time scale for the WD pulsar.
With more extensive observations, Stiller et al. (2018)
ﬁrmly established ˙P = 7.18
10−13 s s−1 that is al-
most twice as large as the value reported in Marsh et al.
(2016), but consistent with the constraints in Potter &
Buckley (2018a). The concomitant spin-down power is

absence of an accretion disk2. More recently, X-ray data
have established no evidence of an accretion column,
and spectral analysis of the subdominant pulsed com-
ponent suggests it is non-thermal (Takata et al. 2018).
These two characteristics of observed spin-down and ab-
sence of an accretion disk led Buckley et al. (2017) to
attribute the observed non-thermal luminosity to mag-
netic dipole radiation from the WD, conclusively estab-
lishing AR Sco as the ﬁrst known WD pulsar, analogous
to rotation-powered neutron star pulsars.

The WD is highly magnetized (with a polar surface
108 G estimated by setting ˙Erot = ˙Emd,

with ˙Emd the energy loss due to a magnetic dipole ro-
tating in vacuum) and its optical emission is strongly

Potter & Buckley (2018b) conducted extensive follow-
up optical observations on AR Sco, reporting that the
linear ﬂux, circular ﬂux and position angle are coupled
to the spin period P of the WD. The polarization po-
sition angle (PPA; ψ) vs. time indicates clear periodic
emission. In this paper, we model the linear polariza-
tion signature with the rotating vector model (RVM;

2 This is supported by the fact that the X-ray luminosity is only 4%
of the total, optically-dominated observed luminosity and is only
∼ 1% of the X-ray luminosities of typical intermediate polars, and
also from the fact that all optical and ultraviolet emission lines
originate from the irradiated face of the M-dwarf companion.

with α the magnetic inclination angle of the magnetic
dipole moment µ and ζ the observer angle (observer’s
line of sight), both measured with respect to the WD’s
rotation axis Ω, φ the rotational phase (WD spin), and
the parameters φ0 and ψ0 are used to deﬁne a ﬁducial
plane. The light curve from Buckley et al. (2017) man-
ifests double peaks with a more intense ﬁrst peak fol-
lowed by a dimmer second peak, exhibiting a peak sep-
180◦. In addition, the PPA makes a 180◦
aration of
sweep. These facts imply that the WD may be an or-
thogonal rotator if the emission originates close to its
polar caps (Geng et al. 2016; Buckley et al. 2017). We
show that our solution for α using the RVM supports
this conjecture.

∼

The observations by Marsh et al. (2016) indicate ir-
radiation of the side of the WD facing the companion.
This forms part of the observed sinusoidal radial ve-
locity proﬁle, suggesting that the two stars are tidally
locked (Buckley et al. 2017; Takata et al. 2017; Pot-
ter & Buckley 2018b). To account for the observed
non-thermal radiation, models invoke injection of rel-
ativistic electrons by the companion along the magnetic
ﬁeld lines of the WD, where they are trapped and ac-
celerated (Geng et al. 2016; Takata et al. 2017; Buck-
ley et al. 2017). However, diﬀerent proposed scenarios
place the non-thermal emission regions in diﬀerent spa-
tial locales. Geng et al. (2016) noted that the Goldreich-
Julian charge number density (Goldreich & Julian 1969)
of the WD is much lower than required by the observed
SR spectrum and thus argued that the emission should
originate closer to the companion (they suggest at an in-
trabinary shock caused by the interacting stellar winds;
Marsh et al. 2016; Geng et al. 2016) where the particle
number density is higher. They noted that the spin-
down luminosity of the WD is suﬃcient to power the
emission of the system. On the other hand, upon an
injection of relativistic particles from the companion,
emission may originate from near the magnetic poles of
the WD by means of pulsar emission mechanisms (with
the emission from downward-moving particles being di-
rected toward the WD; cf. Buckley et al. 2017; Takata
et al. 2017; Potter & Buckley 2018b; Takata & Cheng
2019). This is supported by the geometric model of Pot-
ter & Buckley (2018b) that can reproduce the observed
polarization signatures if the emission location is taken
to be at the magnetic poles of the WD. In what follows,
we demonstrate that the RVM3 provides an excellent ﬁt
to the PPA curve, thereby favoring the magnetospheric
scenario, if particles sustain small pitch angles. How-
ever, we note that this hypothesis may not be unique,

3 It is important to note that the RVM is a purely geometrical
model, and as such cannot make any statements about light curve
shapes or spectra expected from AR Sco. Neither can we con-
strain particle energies or injection rates or the acceleration pro-
cess within this framework. We defer the construction of a full
emission model to a future paper.

since Takata & Cheng (2019) claim that they can also
reproduce the polarization properties using an indepen-
dent emission model
in which the particle pitch angles
evolve with time and become quite large at the emis-
sion regions, which are incidentally also located rela-
tively close to the WD polar caps.

The structure of this article is as follows. In Section 2
we discuss the folding of the data, code calibration and
ﬁts. We present our results in Section 3. Our discussion
and conclusions follow in Section 4 and 5.

2. METHOD
2.1. Folding of Data

We use the PPA data from Buckley et al. (2017), com-

prising observations on 14 March 2016 in the 340
−
900 nm range. We obtain the minimum PPA of the
dataset and deﬁne the corresponding time t0 as the
starting point to fold the dataset. A few data points
(
3%) deviate from the average PPA vs. φ curve,
∼
but we note that the folding is aﬀected by the choice
of t0. We remedy this convention issue by generating
smoothed PPA curves with a Kernel Density Estima-
tion and a Gaussian kernel technique. By inspecting the
deviation between the smoothed curve and the folded
data, we assign a new convention to the points with a
large deviation by shifting these points by 180◦ (which
is the intrinsic uncertainty of the convention assigned to
the PPA,
i.e., there is an ambiguity in the parallel and
anti-parallel directions). We then bin the data into 30
rotational phase bins. The predicted values of ψ from
Eq. (1) are discontinuous, since the arctangent function
is discontinuous at φdisc = arccos (tan ζ/ tan α) . Using
this expression, we locate the discontinuities and shift
the predicted PPA by 360◦ at these phases to ﬁnally
obtain a smooth, continuous PPA model.

2.2. Code Veriﬁcation and Best Fit

We adopt the convention of Everett & Weisberg
(2001), letting ψ increase in the counter-clockwise direc-
tion. Thus we deﬁne ψ′ =
ψ. A Bayesian likelihood
−
approach is employed to constrain the RVM using the
optical PPA data. We deﬁne our “best ﬁt” as the 50th
percentile or median in the posterior distribution of the
model parameters. We veriﬁed our code by obtaining
and comparing independent RVM ﬁts of radio pulsar
data (Everett & Weisberg 2001), yielding consistent α
and ζ values, within uncertainties.

For the Bayesian analysis, we employ a Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo technique (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013)
with 50 walkers, 40,000 steps and a step burn-in of
14,000. We maximize the following likelihood function:

where S2
n+f 2(H(φ, α, β, φ0, ψ0))2, y represents the
data values, σ the uncertainties of the data (assumed to
follow a Gaussian distribution) and H the model values.
The factor f compensates for the case when the PPA
uncertainties are underestimated. We assume uniform
priors on the cosine of α and ζ (rather than the angles
themselves). For cos ζ, this is an appropriate choice from
Copernican arguments. For cos α, this convention is less
justiﬁed, but nevertheless ultimately immaterial for the
present context; we have veriﬁed there is no dramatic
change in resulting uncertainties with a uniform prior
choice on α rather than cos α.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Constraints on WD Geometry
The red curve in Figure 1 depicts the best-ﬁt RVM4
to the polarization data, with yellow curves associated
with a random selection of parameters from the pos-
terior distribution of cos α and cos ζ. The uncertain-
ties for the best ﬁt are taken to be the 68% probability
around the median, i.e., the 16th and 84th percentile
values. From our best ﬁts of these quantities, we ob-
tain α = 86.6◦+3.0◦
−2.8◦ and ζ = 60.4◦+5.3◦
−6.0◦. For the un-
certainty parameter ln(f ), only the maximum of ln(f )
is constrained, and f is quite small, thus we conclude
the data are described well by the model without the
inclusion of this term.

The correlation or degeneracy seen between φ0 and
ψ0 in Figure 2 owes to the fact that these parameters
translate the model horizontally and vertically; thus, a
natural degeneracy exists, since the model is cyclic and a
similar ﬁt may be obtained for diﬀerent choices of φ0 and
ψ0. This is also the reason why small, disconnected con-
tours could be eliminated from Figure 2 by constraining
the priors of the nuisance parameters φ0 and ψ0. The
large duty cycle leads to relatively small uncertainties
on both α and ζ as compared to the case of known radio
pulsars. The pulses of the latter typically have small
duty cycles and thus relatively large uncertainties on
α (the impact angle β = ζ
α is typically better con-
−
strained, given visibility requirements, but ζ may remain
ill-constrained).

ing its Roche lobe. Moreover, from spectroscopic com-

Finally, based on the stellar radius estimate and the stel-

The mass mWD is generally6 insensitive to the value
of mM, as is readily apparent from the q
1 limit of
Eq. (3), and therefore also to any systematic errors asso-
ciated with observational determinations of RM and also
the approximation employed in Eq. (4). Constraints on
mWD may be obtained under the assumption ζ
i,
which is generally expected from formation/evolution
and observed in other contexts (e.g., Albrecht et al. 2007;
Watson et al. 2011). Note that the spin angular momen-
tum of the WD is about two orders of magnitude inferior
to the total orbital angular momentum. Since it is likely
that the WD was spun up to its exceptionally low period
of P = 117 s via past accretion episodes, the transfer of
angular momentum would tend to align the WD spin to
the orbit angular momentum. Allowing mM be a free pa-
rameter, while propagating normally-distributed uncer-
tainties for K2 and cos ζ (see Figure 2) in Eq. (3) yields a

and is also typical of donor-star masses in other systems having
similar orbital periods as AR Sco.

6 This is true as long as q is in fact ≫ 1. If q ∼ 1 then mWD is
sensitive on the value of q. For our assumed value of q ∼ 3, there
is a small inﬂuence of mWD.

probability distribution of mWD while {red, blue} curves de-
lineate regions of {68%, 95%} probability. The pink band
is the constraint 1 < q < 2.86 from Marsh et al. (2016),

Eq. (4). The Chandrasekhar limit of mWD < 1.44M⊙ is
traced by the cyan dashed line.

and systematics which may be present in the M star
mass/radius estimate.

3.3. Geodetic Precession

If we allow misalignment of the spin and orbital axes
ζ
= i, this may explain why the optical maximum does
not occur at inferior conjunction of the WD (Buckley
et al. 2017). Katz (2017) proposed that this mismatch
may be explained either by dissipation in a bow wave or
by misalignment between the WD spin axis and both
the orbital axis and the WD’s oblique magnetic mo-
ment as well as potential oblateness of the WD, causing
precession of the spin axis. The latter would lead to
variable heating of the companion surface along with a
drift in the phase of the optical maximum, with a pe-
riod of decades. Peterson et al. (2019) analyzed a cen-
tury’s worth of optical photometry on AR Sco but could
not detect any precessional period as suggested by Katz
(2017), although this period may be much longer for a
larger angle of misalignment between the orbital plane
and the WD spin axis, or a smaller oblateness.

We suggest that eﬀective spin-orbit interaction may
result in the precession of the WD pulsar spin axis
(Damour & Ruﬃni 1974; Esposito & Harrison 1975) ow-
ing to the metric curvature of the companion, even if the
WD is not oblate. While any precession in the system
may be dominated by electromagnetic inﬂuences of the
companion, the General Relativity (GR) rate calculated
below is the minimum rate in absence of any electro-
magnetic torques. In the framework of classical GR, the

angular geodetic precession rate ωp is derived by Barker
& O’Connell (1975a,b). The rate of precession is insen-
sitive to mWD and may be estimated independent of the

(5)

Since the orbital eccentricity ε is presumably close to
zero, the numerical value in Eq. (5) constitutes a lower
limit to the expected precession rate. This rate is sim-
ilar to pulsar systems where such precession has been
detected (e.g., B1913+16 Weisberg et al. 1989; Cordes
et al. 1990; Kramer 1998) over decade timescales. The
observable scope of precession depends on the degree of
misalignment; if ζ is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from i, such
precession (including that by oblateness of the WD) may
be imprinted on the pulses and PPA swings of AR Sco
and therefore changes in ζ values may be detectable on
similar decade timescales as in pulsar binary systems.
That is, from long-term time evolution of pulses and
polarization data, the degree of misalignment may be
estimated. Moreover, if well-characterized, such preces-
sion also aﬀords an independent constraint on the com-
ponent masses.

Takata & Cheng (2019) also note that a detailed com-
parison between model and measured PPA sweeps may
constrain the orientation of the spin axis of the WD. In
future, we will study polarization data as a function of
orbital phase φb to constrain the eﬀects of precession
that a varying α or ζ vs. φb may point to. In addition,
predictions from a full emission model should lead to
predictions of the PPA evolution that may be ﬁt to data
to constrain the WD spin axis alignment with the orbital
axis and / or precession in the system. It is hoped that
contraints on precession may teach us more about the
system’s characteristics, analogous to the case of PSR
J1906+0746 where observations over several years of this
precessing pulsar revealed the average structure of the
radio beam (Desvignes et al. 2019).

4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Assumptions Regarding the Particle Pitch Angle

Using our ﬁts for α and ζ, we can constrain the geom-
etry of the emission region for the optical radiation. The
derivation of the RVM (see Appendix of du Plessis et al.
2019) assumes that the observer samples emission that
is tangent to local magnetic ﬁeld lines and that the po-
larization vector is in the poloidal plane. This is a good
approximation in either SR or curvature radiation (CR)
scenarios, provided that the particle momentum paral-
lel to the ﬁeld is relativistic and the relativistic particles
have small pitch angles.

At ﬁrst sight, this assumption of small pitch angle η
seems plausible since, for a large Lorentz factor γ, the

1/γ (see Eq. (10) where we esti-
mate that the particles radiating optical emission have

η, and that η
5). However, both γ and
∼
η evolve with distance as the particles move along the
B-ﬁeld lines. For example, Takata et al. (2017) solve
an approximate form7 of the coupled set of equations
that describe the evolution of γ and perpendicular mo-
mentum p⊥, used earlier by Harding et al. (2005) in the
context of neutron star pulsars. Takata et al. (2017,
2018); Takata & Cheng (2019) assume that relativis-
tic particles are injected from the companion and travel
into the WD magnetosphere (along closed B-ﬁeld lines,
60◦ < 90◦) before radiat-

ing signiﬁcantly, since the SR timescale is much longer
than the light crossing timescale r/c at the companion
a). They then study a magnetic mirror
position (r
p2
eﬀect in which the ﬁrst adiabatic invariant µ
⊥/B is
conserved and ﬁnd that if the initial pitch angle is large
enough (sin η0 > 0.05, i.e. outside a loss cone set by ini-
tial conditions), the mirror eﬀect operates and the pitch
angles increase to
π/2 at the mirror point (thus violat-
ing the RVM assumption of tangential emission) as the
particles move closer to the WD surface. In this case,
signiﬁcant emission occurs at the mirror point, since SR
losses increase rapidly with B and η, before the particles
return outward.

7 The set of equations used by Takata et al. (2017) are valid only
for γ ≫ 1 and η ≪ 1, and assumes that the accelerating E-
ﬁeld is screened. The more general form of the equations used
by Harding et al. (2005) includes a term involving a non-zero
E-ﬁeld, but are subject to the drift approximation, where the
motion of the guiding center is considered and the helical motion
is averaged over gyrophase. We concur with Takata et al. (2017)
that the local accelerating E-ﬁeld (parallel to the local B-ﬁeld)
is probably screened – see Eq. (16) below. We do not address
the details of the acceleration process in this paper, other than
to note it seems suﬃcient to accelerate particles to very large
γe,max ∼ eBRcomp/mec2 ∼ 106 − 108. Such high factors are
needed if SR is to account for the observed X-ray emission, as
noted in Eq. (13).

energy abruptly suﬀering catastrophic SR losses. Thus,
the pitch angle may never attain very large values.

We thus note that small pitch angles (as assumed by
the RVM) are plausible in two cases: (i) There exist
some parameter choices where tSR > tcross at a height r
that is some substantial fraction of a, so that the parti-
cles will radiate all their energy before undergoing mag-
netic mirroring; (ii) particles with small enough initial
pitch angles (e.g., sin η0 . 0.05) will fall in the loss cone,
and will not be impacted by the magnetic mirror. A
complete model, solving the particle dynamics generally
(for any η and γ, and not in the drift approximation)
to predict the light curves, spectrum and polarization
properties of AR Sco will be able to address this issue
more fully.

4.2. Constraints on the Emission Geometry

In a dipolar magnetosphere, multiple locations satisfy
the viewing constraints derivable using our α and ζ ﬁts
within the framework of the RVM, which assumes emis-
sion to be tangential to the local B-ﬁeld, irrespective of
altitude, since a dipolar ﬁeld is self-similar (additional
spectral information may help constrain the actual emis-
sion heights, not just the emission directions). Depend-
ing on the current system, any non-zero subset of these
locations could participate to produce the observed PPA
curve. Thus, since the RVM variation is seen over en-

respect to µ) which the observer samples during one full ro-
tation in WD spin phase φ for a static dipole magnetosphere.
As in Figure 4, the red and blue colors denote inﬂowing and
outﬂowing charges in a particular magnetic hemisphere (as
deﬁned by φB), deﬁned with respect to the closest magnetic
pole. The magnetic poles are located at θB = 0, π.

tire spin rotation of the WD, at least one of the mul-
tiple solutions must be realized (e.g., the model Pot-
ter & Buckley 2018b that only assumes inﬂowing par-
ticles would satisfy these constraints). We indicate this
schematically in Figure 4, where we show an orthogo-
nal rotator and four diﬀerent tangents pointing in the
observer direction for a particular ζ. Outﬂowing and
inﬂowing particles with respect to the nearest magnetic
pole are indicated by blue and red arrows, respectively.
Blue arrows thus occur in the top half of the meridional
slice (large magnetic longitude), and red ones in the bot-
tom (small magnetic longitude). Dark and light colors
are used to further distinguish between solutions. The
meaning of colors remains identical in Figure 5, where we
indicate constraints involving the magnetic co-latitude
θB and longitude φB (both deﬁned with respect to the
magnetic dipole moment axis µ). These constraints de-
rive from the condition that the magnetic ﬁeld tangents
are sampled by the observer, for α = 87◦ and ζ = 60◦.
For θB, the solutions satisfy Eq. (34) and its reﬂection
given in Wadiasingh et al. (2018).

The diﬀerent panels in Figure 5 are 2D projections of
the 3D plot in the leftmost corner. The top left panel
indicates that the ‘red solutions’ are located around
π (i.e., in

meridional and antimeriodional planes with respect to
µ). In the top right panel, the light and dark colored
lines coincide, indicating that the observer samples the

same φB for each color during the course of one rota-
tion of the WD, independent of θB. The red and blue
solutions are of similar functional form, but oﬀset by a
factor π in φB, as previously. The bottom right projec-
tion indicates that the light and dark red solutions have
π/2 in θB, and the
the same form (oﬀset by a factor
same for the light and dark blue), but the red vs. blue
ones are mirror images of each other (being φ
π out of
phase), since they originate close to opposite magnetic
poles. Thus, the observer would sample the light blue
and dark red solutions (or light red and dark blue ones),
oﬀset by half a rotation in spin phase φ, even though
they trace out the same range in θB.

∼

∼

The constrained spatial region that follows from our
RVM ﬁts suggests that a large portion of the magneto-
sphere, at multiple altitudes, must support relativistic
charges. Depending on scenarios of particle accelera-
tion, charges may be either ingoing or outgoing relative
to the WD surface, halving the number of potential sites
of emission, unless there are counterstreaming beams. In
a more complete emission model beyond the geometric
RVM, deriving constraints on the altitude of emission
should be possible, thereby pinning down the precise lo-
cation in the magnetosphere where emission arises at
any phase.

implying that the two-star interaction may lead to a
much larger opening angle, or that the emission comes
from relatively high up, originating on ﬂaring magnetic

Observations by Buckley et al. (2017) indicate that the
degree of linear polarization of the optical data varies
with orbital phase, but may reach up to 40%. This
constraint should be exploited in an emission model,
but is beyond the RVM’s capabilities. For example,
Takata & Cheng (2019) argue that a polarization degree
that varies with orbital phase may be understood in the
framework of diﬀerent contributions of the SR and the
thermal emission from the companion, since the latter
may depolarize the observed emission. We expect that
a model that includes emission from diﬀerent emission
heights that bunch in phase to form the peaks will not
likely overpredict the maximum observed polarization
degree of 40%. SR from a single particle in an ordered
ﬁeld may reach high values, but this will be lowered by
contributions from several particles within the popula-
tion of radiating particles emitting at diﬀerent spatial

locales. This is similar to the ﬁndings of Harding &
Kalapotharakos (2017) who found large PA swings and
deep depolarization dips during the light-curve peaks in
all energy bands in their multiwavelength pulsar model
that invoke caustic emission. Such a model may not be
exactly applicable to the WD pulsar, although contribu-
tions from emitting particles at diﬀerent altitudes may
provide a blended polarization signature, thus lowering
the polarization degree vs. that expected from a single
particle in an ordered ﬁeld. The detailed characteristics
depend on emission position and mechanism.

When νcycl = νobs,min, B . 7

the emission site is at least
5RWD above the stellar
surface. Another constraint on B may be obtained by
requiring the ratio of electromagnetic to kinetic particle
energy density to be σ
1 (since the RVM results point
to particles following the local ﬁeld), but this limit is not
very constraining due to the uncertain emission volume.
On the other hand, the plasma density should be high
enough to explain the observed ﬂux of non-thermal emis-
sion. To estimate a lower limit for the plasma density
(since the charge density may be much lower than the
actual number density) we can calculate the Goldreich-

Julian suggesting screening of E ﬁelds and electron-ion
plasma sourced from the companion. On the other hand,
since we have demonstrated that the PPA of the WD
can be modeled by the RVM, this could mean that the
emission of the AR Sco system originates from a dipole-
like magnetosphere surrounding the WD (Buckley et al.
2017). Using observations of the linear ﬂux, circular ﬂux
and PPA observations, Potter & Buckley (2018b) show
that the polarization is coupled to the WD spin period,
agreeing with our conclusion, while models that place
the emission site at the companion fail to explain the
polarization signatures that are clearly coupled to the
spin period of the WD. The ‘missing’ particles noted by
Geng et al. (2016) may either be supplied by the com-
panion that may inject relativistic electrons into the WD
magnetosphere, or less likely by pair cascades (probably
needing severely non-polar B-ﬁeld structures) occurring
in the WD magnetosphere, and does not per se argue for
an emission location near a putative bow shock. More-
over, freshly-injected particles from the companion may
solve the issue of needing non-zero pitch angles for SR
to dominate.

(2018b) who adopted ζ = 60◦ for their model to repro-
duce the observed data. Using the result of ζ = 60◦ we
then found that mWD = 1.00+0.19
−0.13M⊙, which is within
the limits by Marsh et al. (2016). We next obtained
q = 3.45+0.66
−0.45, which is slightly larger compared to the

∼

value of q = 2.67 calculated by Marsh et al. (2016) when
adopting mWD = 0.8. Our ﬁts of the PPA evolution
of the WD using the RVM could imply that the emis-
sion of the AR Sco system originates from the dipole-like
magnetosphere of the WD, probably close to its polar
caps, while the particles are probably being accelerated
at and injected from the companion star. The issue of
pitch angle evolution should be addressed with detailed
emission modelling.

Future work includes ﬁtting the RVM to PPA data
in other energy bands, applying a general polarization
calculation that includes special-relativistic corrections
and investigating the eﬀect of diﬀerent types of magnetic
ﬁeld structures on the predicted polarization signatures.
We will also model the phase-resolved PPA to infer α
and ζ for diﬀerent orbital phases, which may constrain
eﬀects of spin precession in this system. This work high-
lights the complementary constraints on system geome-
try, emission locales and radiation physics that are sup-
plied by adding polarization data to spectral and tem-
poral data within a uniﬁed approach.
