Abstract

An edge-colored hypergraph is rainbow if all of its edges have diﬀerent colors. Given two
hypergraphs H and G, the anti-Ramsey number ar(G, H) of H in G is the maximum number
of colors in a coloring of the edges of G so that there does not exist a rainbow copy of H. Li
et al. determined the anti-Ramsey number of k-matchings in complete bipartite graphs. Jin
and Zang showed the uniqueness of the extremal coloring. In this paper, as a generalization
of these results, we determine the anti-Ramsey number arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) of k-matchings in
complete r-partite r-uniform hypergraphs and show the uniqueness of the extremal coloring.
Also, we show that Kk−1,n2,...,nr is the unique extremal hypergraph for Tur´an number
exr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) and show that arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) = exr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk−1) + 1, which
gives a multi-partite version result of ¨Ozkahya and Young’s conjecture.

Introduction

An edge-colored graph G is called rainbow if every edge of G receives a diﬀerent color. Given
two graphs H and G, ar(H, G) is deﬁned to be the maximum number of colors in a coloring
of the edges of H that has no rainbow copy of G. The number ar(H, G) is called the anti-
Ramsey number of G in H. When H = Kn, ar(Kn, G) is the anti-Ramsey number of G.
Let ex(H, G) denote the maximum number of edges that a subgraph of H can have with no
subgraph isomorphic to G.

The study of anti-Ramsey number began by Erd˝os et al. [3] in 1970s. In the original work,
k−1 (cid:17) n + O(1), and proved the conjecture when
they conjectured that ar (Kn, Ck) = (cid:16)
k = 3. After that, Alon [1] proved the conjecture for k = 4. Jiang, Schiermeyer and West
(unpublished manuscript) proved the conjecture for k ≤ 7. Finally, Montellano-Ballesteros and

2 + 1
k−2

Neumann-Lara [12] completely proved the conjecture in 2005.

For matchings, Schiermeyer [14] used a counting technique to determine ar(Kn, kK2) for all
k ≥ 2 and n ≥ 3k + 3. After that, Fujita et al. [5] solved this problem for k ≥ 2 and n ≥ 2k + 1.
[2] extended Schiermeyer’s result to all k ≥ 2 and n ≥ 2k by using the

In 2009, Chen et al.

Gallai-Edmonds structure theorem.

Taking complete bipartite graphs as the host graphs, Li et al [9] determined ar(Kn1,n2, kK2)
for all k ≥ 1. Denote by Bn,m the set of all the m-regular bipartite graphs of order 2n. Li and
Xu [10] showed that ar(Bn,m, kK2) = m(k − 2) + 1 for k ≥ 2, m ≥ 3 and n > 3k − 1.

A hypergraph H = (V (H), E(H)) is a ﬁnite set V (H) of elements, called vertices, together
with a ﬁnite set E(H) of subsets of V (H), called hyperedges or simply edges. The union of
hypergraphs G and H is the graph G∪H with vertex set V (G)∪V (H) and edge set E(G)∪E(H). If
each edge of H has exactly r vertices, H is called r-uniform. For a subset V ′ of V (H), denoted
by H[V ′] the subhypergraph of H induced by V ′. For v ∈ V (H), we use H − v to denote
H[V (H)\{v}]. For an edge e in E(H), denoted by H − e the hypergraph obtained by deleting
e from H. For a vertex v ∈ V (H), the degree dH(v) is deﬁned as the number of edges of H
containing v. A vertex of degree zero is called an isolated vertex. For u, v ∈ V (H), we deﬁne
dH(u, v) to be the number of edges of H containing {u, v}, and we call this number the co-degree
of {u, v}. For a hypergraph H, we denote the number of edges in H by e(H). A complete r-
uniform hypergraph is a hypergraph whose edge set consists of all r-subsets of the vertex set. A

matching in a hypergraph is a set of edges in which no two edges have a common vertex. We call
a matching with k edges a k-matching, denoted by Mk. An edge-colored hypergraph is called
rainbow hypergraph if the all of its edges have diﬀerent colors. The representing hypergraph of
a hypergraph H with an edge coloring c is a spanning subhypergraph of H obtained by taking
one edge of each color of c. For an edge set E ⊆ E(H), let c(E) denote the set of colors of edges
in E. For simplicity, when E = {e} and E = E(H), we use c(e) and c(H) instead of c({e}) and
c(E(H)), respectively.

Let n1, n2, . . . , nr be integers and V1, V2, . . . , Vr be disjoint vertex sets with |Vi| = ni for
each i = 1, 2, . . . , r. A complete r-partite r-uniform hypergraph on vertex classes V1, V2, . . . , Vr,
denoted by Kn1,...,nr , is deﬁned to be the r-uniform hypergraph whose edge set consists of all
the r-element subsets S of V1 ∪ · · · ∪ Vr such that |S ∩ Vi| = 1 for all i = 1, 2, . . . , r.

Given two hypergraphs H and G, the anti-Ramsey number of H in G, denoted by ar(G, H), is

2

the maximum number of colors in a coloring of the edges of G with no rainbow copy of H. When
G is an r-uniform complete hypergraph on n vertices, arr(G, H) is the anti-Ramsey number of
H. The Tur´an number exr(G, H) is the maximum number of edges in an H-free subhypergraph
of G, where H-free hypergraph is one which contains no H as a subhypergraph.

Gu et al. [6] determined the anti-Ramsey numbers of linear paths/cycles and loose paths/cycles
in hypergraphs for suﬃciently large n and gave bounds on the anti-Ramsey numbers of Berge
paths/cycles. For the anti-Ramsey number of matchings in hypergraphs, ¨Ozkahya and Young
[13] stated a conjecture that arr(Kn, Mk) = exr(Kn, Mk−1) + 1 for all n > sk and proved
the conjecture when k = 2, 3 and n is suﬃciently large. Recently, Frankl and Kupavskii [4]
proved that the conjecture is true for n ≥ rk + (r − 1)(k − 1) and k ≥ 3. Jin [7] determined
the exact value of the anti-Ramsey number of a k-matching in a complete tripartite 3-uniform

hypergraph.

Take a subhypergraph Kk−2,n2,...,nr of Kn1,n2,...,nr . Color the edges of Kk−2,n2,...,nr by distinct
colors and color the remaining edges of Kn1,...,nr by a new color. Denote by φr the obtained
((k − 2)n2 · · · nr + 1)-edge-coloring of Kn1,...,nr . Li, Tu and Jin [9] determined the following
results in complete bipartite graphs.

Theorem 1 ([9]). For n2 ≥ n1 ≥ k ≥ 1,

ex(Kn1,n2, kK2) = (k − 1)n2.

Moreover, Kk−1,n2 is the unique such extremal graph.

Theorem 2 ([9]). For n2 ≥ n1 ≥ k ≥ 3,

ar(Kn1,n2, kK2) = (k − 2)n2 + 1.

In addition to the anti-Ramsey number, another interesting problem posed by Erd˝os is the

uniqueness of the extremal coloring. In [8], Jin and Zang obtained the following result.

Theorem 3 ([8]). For n2 ≥ n1 ≥ k ≥ 3, every ((k − 2)n2 + 1)-edge-coloring except for φ2 of
Kn1,n2 contains a rainbow kK2.

The following proposition provides a lower and upper bound for arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk), and the

proof of which is similar to that of [14].

Proposition 4. exr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk−1) + 1 ≤ arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) ≤ exr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk).

Proof. The upper bound is clear. For the lower bound, let H0 be an extremal hypergraph for
exr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk−1) and color all edges of H0 diﬀerently and all the edges in E (Kn1,...,nr ) \E (H0)

3

with one extra color. The hypergraph Kn1,...,nr with this coloring does not contain a rainbow
k-matching. The result follows.

The proposition provides a lower bound for arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk). In this paper we will show
that arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) = exr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk−1) + 1, which gives a multi-partite version result of
¨Ozkahya and Young’s conjecture.

In [11], Liu and Wang determined exr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk).

Theorem 5 ([11]). For nr ≥ nr−1 ≥ · · · ≥ n1 ≥ k ≥ 1,

exr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) = (k − 1)n2 · · · nr.

We will show that Kk−1,n2,...,nr is the unique extremal hypergraph in Theorem 5.

The following result is very useful for us.

Theorem 6. For nr ≥ nr−1 ≥ · · · ≥ n1 ≥ k ≥ 1, every subhypergraph of Kn1,...,nr with (k −
1)n2 · · · nr edges and without isolated vertices, except for Kk−1,n2,...,nr , contains a k-matching.

Motivated by Theorem 2, one may naturally ask what is the maximum number of colors
in a complete r-partite r-uniform hypergraph without a rainbow k-matching, where r ≥ 3.
This paper focus on the anti-Ramsey number of k-matchings in complete r-partite r-uniform

hypergraphs. The following are our main results.

Theorem 7. (i) For nr ≥ nr−1 ≥ · · · ≥ n1 ≥ 3,

arr(Kn1,...,nr , M2) = 1.

(ii) For n1 = 2, let t be the largest integer such that nt = n1 = 2. Then

arr(Kn1,...,nr , M2) = 2t−1.

Theorem 8. For nr ≥ nr−1 ≥ · · · ≥ n1 ≥ 2k − 1 and k ≥ 3,

arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) = (k − 2)n2 · · · nr + 1.

Moreover, every ((k − 2)n2 · · · nr + 1)-edge-coloring except for φr of Kn1,...,nr contains a rainbow
k-matching.

Combining Theorems 5, 7 and 8, we have the following corollary.

Corollary 9. For nr ≥ nr−1 ≥ · · · ≥ n1 ≥ 2k − 1 and k ≥ 2,

arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) = exr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk−1) + 1.

2 Proofs of Theorems 6 and 7

Proof of Theorem 6. We use induction on r. The base case of r = 2 is true for all n2 ≥ n1 ≥ k
by Theorem 1. Suppose that the assertion holds for all r′ < r. Assume that G is a subhypergraph
of Kn1,...,nr with (k − 1)n2 · · · nr edges and without isolated vertices, and does not contain a
k-matching. Let Vs = {vs1, vs2, . . . , vsns} for s = 1, 2, . . . , r. We consider two diﬀerent cases.

Case 1. n1 = n2.

For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n1, let Fi,j =

{v1i, v2j, w3, . . . , wr} ∈ E(G)| ws ∈ Vs for 3 ≤ s ≤ r

(cid:8)
Fi = Fi,1 ∪ Fi+1,2 ∪ · · · ∪ Fi+n1−1,n1, where Fi,j = Fi−n1,j if i > n1.

and

(cid:9)

For each Fi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n1, we construct an (r − 1)-partite (r − 1)-uniform hypergraph
Gi on vertex classes V1, V3, . . . , Vr, and e = {v1l, w3, . . . , wr} is an edge of Gi if and only if
e′ = {v1l, v2l′, w3, . . . , wr} is an edge of Fi, where l − l′ ≡ i − 1 (mod n1). Therefore, there is a
bijection between Fi and E(Gi). Note that if two edges e1 and e2 in Gi are independent, then
the corresponding edges e′
2 in Fi are also independent. Then we have the following fact.

1 and e′

Fact A. Any matching in Gi corresponds to a matching in Fi ⊆ E(G).

First, we prove the following claims.

Claim 1. For i 6= j, Fi ∩ Fj = ∅.

Proof. If there exists an edge {v1l, v2l′ , w3, . . . , wr} ∈ Fi ∩ Fj, then l − l′ ≡ i − 1 (mod n1) and
l − l′ ≡ j − 1 (mod n1) which implies i = j.

It follows from Claim 1 that e(G) =

n1

Pi=1

|Fi| =

n1

Pi=1

e(Gi).

Claim 2. For any 1 ≤ i ≤ n1, e(Gi) = (k − 1)n3 · · · nr.

Proof. First, we have e(Gi) ≤ (k−1)n3 · · · nr. Otherwise, Gi contains a k-matching by Theorem
5, so does G by Fact A, a contradiction. Hence,

(k − 1)n1n3 · · · nr = e(G) =

n1

X
i=1

e(Gi) ≤ n1(k − 1)n3 · · · nr,

which implies that e(Gi) = (k − 1)n3 · · · nr for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n1.

According to Fact A and Claim 2, Gi is a subhypergraph of Kn1,n3,...,nr with (k − 1)n3 · · · nr
edges and does not contain a k-matching. By the induction hypothesis, Gi ∼= Kk−1,n3,...,nr ∪
(n1 − k + 1)K1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n1. Recall the construction of Gi, we deduce that dG(v1i, v2j) = 0
or dG(v1i, v2j) = n3 · · · nr for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n1. Construct an auxiliary bipartite graph G with
bipartition (V1, V2), where eij = v1iv2j ∈ E(G) if and only if dG(v1i, v2j) = n3 · · · nr. Then
e(G) = (k − 1)n2 · · · nr implies that e(G) = (k − 1)n2 = (k − 1)n1. We claim that there is
no k-matching in G. If there exists a k-matching ei1,j1, ei2,j2, . . ., eik,jk in G, we can ﬁnd k

5

i1,j1, e′

i2,j2, . . ., e′

ik,jk to form a k-matching in G, where e′

edges e′
il,jl = {v1,il, v2,jl, v3l, . . . , vrl} for
l = 1, 2, . . . , r. This contradicts the choice of G. It follows from Theorem 1 that G ∼= Kk−1,n1 ∪
(n1 − k + 1)K1. Without loss of generality, let E(G) = {v1iv2j| 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ n2}.
By the construction of G, every edge in E(Kn1,...,nr ) containing {v1i, v2j } is an edge in G for
1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ n2. Hence, G ∼= Kk−1,n2,n3,...,nr when n1 = n2.

Case 2. n1 < n2.

Claim 3. For u ∈ V2, dG (u) = (k − 1)n3 · · · nr.

Proof. If there exists a vertex u ∈ V2 such that dG(u) < (k − 1)n3 · · · nr, then

e(G − u) = e(G) − dG(u) > (k − 1)(n2 − 1)n3 · · · nr.

By Theorem 5, G − u contains a k-matching, so does G, a contradiction. Hence, dG(u) ≥
(k − 1)n3 · · · nr for all u ∈ V2. Note that

(k − 1)n2 · · · nr = e(G) =

X
u∈V2

dG (u) ≥ (k − 1)n2n3 · · · nr.

We deduce that dG(u) = (k − 1)n3 · · · nr for all u ∈ V2.

2 ⊆ V2 such that |V ′

2| = n1. Let G′ = G[V1, V ′

2, V3, . . . , Vr]. According to Claim 3, we

Set V ′
have e(G′) =

dG(u) = (k − 1)n1n3 · · · nr. It follows from Case 1 that

Pu∈V ′

2

G′ ∼= Kk−1,n1,n3,...,nr ∪ (n1 − k + 1)K1.

Combining this with the arbitrariness of V ′
2, we have dG(v1i, v2j) = 0 or dG(v1i, v2j ) = n3 · · · nr
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n1, 1 ≤ j ≤ n2. Construct an auxiliary bipartite graph G with bipartition (V1, V2),
where eij = v1iv2j ∈ E(G) if and only if dG (v1i, v2j ) = n3 · · · nr. Then e(G) = (k − 1)n2n3 · · · nr
implies that e(G) = (k − 1)n2. We claim that there is no k-matching. Otherwise, if there is a
k-matching ei1,j1, . . . , eik,jk in G, we can ﬁnd k edges in Fi1,j1, . . . , Fik,jk to form a k-matching
in G, a contradiction. By Theorem 1, G ∼= Kk−1,n2 ∪ (n1 − k + 1)K1. Without loss of generality,
let E(G) = {v1iv2j| 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ n2}. By the construction of G, every edge in
E(Kn1,...,nr ) containing {v1i, v2j} is an edge in G for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ n2. Hence,
G ∼= Kk−1,n2,n3,...,nr .

We now turn to the proofs of the main results of this paper. Theorem 7 gives the value of
anti-Ramsey number of k-matching in complete r-partite r-uniform hypergraphs when k = 2.

Proof of Theorem 7.

(i) n1 ≥ 3.

6

Suppose to the contrary that H is a complete r-partite r-uniform hypergraph colored by more
than one color, and containing no rainbow 2-matching. Set e, f ∈ E(H) such that c(e) 6= c(f ).
Clearly, E(H − e) ∩ E(H − f ) 6= ∅ as n1 ≥ 3. Choose an edge g ∈ E(H − e) ∩ E(H − f ), then
c(g) = c(e) as H does not contain a rainbow 2-matching. Similarly, we have c(g) = c(f ), then
c(e) = c(f ), contradicting the fact c(e) 6= c(f ). Therefore, |c(H)| = 1, i.e., arr(Kn1,...,nr , M2) =
1.

(ii) n1 = 2.

By the choice of t, n1 = n2 = · · · = nt = 2. Let H ∼= Kn1,...,nr be a complete r-partite
r-uniform hypergraph. Let R(H, t) = {{v1, v2, . . . , vt}| vi ∈ Vi and i ∈ [t]}. For any edge
e = {v1, v2, . . . , vr} ∈ E(H), let R(e, t) = {v1, v2, . . . , vt}. For α = {v1, v2, . . . , vt} ∈ R(H, t), let
α = {v1, v2, . . . , vt}, where vi is the remaining vertex in Vi except vi. For α = {v1, v2, . . . , vt} ∈
R(H, t), let

E{α,α} = {e ∈ E(H) | R(e, t) = α or R(e, t) = α}.

Then we decompose the edge set of H into E(H) = ∪{α,α}∈QE{α,α}, where Q = {{α, α}| α ∈
R(H, t)}. It is easily checked that |Q| = 2t−1 and E{α,α} ∩ E{β,β} = ∅ for any two diﬀerent
elements {α, α}, {β, β} in Q.

We consider the following coloring of H: For any two edges e, f ∈ E(H), c(e) = c(f ) if and
only if there exists an element {α, α} ∈ Q such that e, f ∈ E{α,α}. By the deﬁnition of the
coloring of H, any two independent edges have the same color and |c(H)| = |Q| = 2t−1. So H
does not contain a rainbow 2-matching. Therefore, arr(Kn1,...,nr , M2) ≥ 2t−1.

Let H = Kn1,...,nr be an edge-colored complete r-partite r-uniform hypergraph without rain-

bow 2-matchings. To obtain the upper bound, we consider the following cases.

Case 1. t = r.

In this case, E{α,α} = {α, α}. Then E(H) can be decomposed into 2r−1 pairs of independent
edges, and each pair of edges must be colored by the same color. Hence |c(H)| ≤ 2r−1, then
arr(K2,...,2, M2) ≤ 2r−1, which implies that arr(K2,...,2, M2) = 2r−1.

Case 2. t < r.

Recall that E(H) = ∪{α,α}∈QE{α,α}. We have the following claims.

Claim 1. For any {α, α} ∈ Q, if e, f ∈ E{α,α} and R(e, t) = R(f, t), then c(e) = c(f ).

Proof. For any {α, α} ∈ Q, since nr ≥ · · · ≥ nt+1 ≥ 3, there exists an edge g = {u1, u2, . . . , ur}
∈ E{α,α}, such that R(g, t) = R(e, t) and uj ∈ Vj − e ∪ f for j = t + 1, . . . , r. Then g ∩ e =
g ∩ f = ∅. Therefore, c(e) = c(g) = c(f ). Otherwise, H contains a rainbow 2-matching.

Claim 2. For any {α, α} ∈ Q, if e, f ∈ E{α,α} and R(e, t) = R(f, t), then c(e) = c(f ).

7

Proof. Since nr ≥ · · · ≥ nt+1 ≥ 3, there exists an edge g = {u1, u2, . . . , ur} ∈ E{α,α} with
R(g, t) = R(e, t) and uj ∈ Vj − f for j = t + 1, . . . , r. It follows from Claim 1 that c(g) = c(e).
Note that g ∩ f = ∅, we have c(f ) = c(g). Then c(e) = c(f ).

Combining these two claims, we conclude that c(E{α,α}) = 1 for any {α, α} ∈ Q. Therefore,

|c(H)| ≤ 2t−1, which implies that arr(Kn1,...,nr , M2) ≤ 2t−1. Thus arr(Kn1,...,nr , M2) = 2t−1.

3 Proof of Theorem 8

In this section we will determine the value of the anti-Ramsey number of k-matchings in com-
plete r-partite r-uniform hypergraphs, and also give the uniqueness of extremal coloring.

We need the following lemma.

Lemma 10. For n1 ≥ 2k − 1 and k ≥ 3,

arr(Kn1,...,n1, Mk) = (k − 2)nr−1

1 + 1,

and every ((k − 2)nr−1
matching.

1 + 1)-edge-coloring except for φr of Kn1,...,n1 contains a rainbow k-

Proof. We use induction on r. The base case of r = 2 is true for all n1 ≥ 2k − 1 by Theorem 2
and Theorem 3. Suppose that the lemma holds for all r′ < r. Assume, by way of contradiction,
that H = Kn1,...,n1 is a hypergraph with a ((k − 2)nr−1
1 + 2)-edge-coloring and does not contain
a rainbow k-matching.

Let Vs = {vs1, vs2, . . . , vsn1}, s = 1, 2, . . . , r. For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n1, let

Ei,j =

(cid:8)

{v1i, v2j, w3, . . . , wr} ∈ E(H) | ws ∈ Vs for 3 ≤ s ≤ r

,
(cid:9)

and Ei = Ei,1 ∪ Ei+1,2 ∪ · · · ∪ Ei+n1−1,n1, where Ei,j = Ei−n1,j if i > n1.

For each Ei, i = 1, 2, . . . , n1, we construct a complete (r−1)-partite (r−1)-uniform hypergraph
Hi on vertex classes V1, V3, . . . , Vr such that e = {v1l, w3, . . . , wr} is an edge of Hi if and only
if e′ = {v1l, v2l′, w3, . . . , wr} is an edge of Ei, where l − l′ ≡ i − 1 (mod n1), and we color e by
c(e′). Therefore, there is a bijection between Ei and E(Hi) and c(Ei) = c(Hi). Note that if
two edges e1 and e2 in Hi are independent, then the corresponding edges e′
2 in Ei are
also independent. Then we have the following fact.

1 and e′

Fact B. Any rainbow matching in Hi corresponds to a rainbow matching in Ei ⊆ E(H).

Without loss of generality, we assume that H1 has the most colors in H1, . . ., Hn1.
Claim 1. |c(H1)| = (k − 2)nr−2
Proof. First, we have |c(Hi)| ≤ (k − 2)nr−2
1 + 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n1. Otherwise, by induc-
tion hypothesis, Hi contains a rainbow k-matching, so does H by Fact B, a contradiction. If

a contradiction. Hence, |c(H1)| = (k − 2)nr−2

1 + 1.

We next show that there exists an integer 2 ≤ t ≤ n1 such that |c(Ht)| = (k − 2)nr−2

1 + 1 and

c(H1) ∩ c(Ht) = ∅. Otherwise,

|c(H)| ≤ ((k − 2)nr−2

1 + 1) + (k − 2)nr−2

1

· (n1 − 1) < (k − 2)nr−1

1 + 2,

contradicting the assumption of H. Since H1 and Ht do not contain a rainbow k-matching and
with (k − 2)nr−2
1 + 1 colors, by the induction hypothesis, they are both colored by φr−1. Let
Ht be the representing hypergraph of Ht. Then

e(Ht) = |c(Ht)| > (k − 2)nr−2

,

so Ht contains a (k − 1)-matching by Theorem 5. Hence, there is a rainbow (k − 1)-matching
in Ht, which corresponds to a rainbow (k − 1)-matching, denoted by Mk−1, in Et. The (k − 1)-
matching Mk−1 meets k − 1 vertices in V1 and k − 1 vertices in V2, respectively. As n1 ≥ 2k − 1,
there exists an integer s, such that v1s ∈ V1 − V (Mk−1) and v2s ∈ V2 − V (Mk−1). Then we
can ﬁnd an edge e ∈ Es,s ⊆ E1 such that e ∩ V (Mk−1) = ∅. Recall that c(H1) ∩ c(Ht) = ∅,
c(H1) = c(E1) and c(Ht) = c(Et), then e ∪ Mk−1 is a rainbow k-matching in H, a contradiction.
Hence arr(Kn1,...,n1, Mk) ≤ (k − 2)nr−1
1 + 1. Combining this with Proposition 4 and Theorem
5, we have arr(Kn1,...,n1, Mk) = (k − 2)nr−1

1 + 1.

Now we prove the uniqueness of the extremal coloring. Suppose that |c(H)| = (k − 2)nr−1
1 + 1
and H does not contain a rainbow k-matching. Let H be the representing hypergraph of
H. Then e(H) = (k − 2)nr−1
1 + 1. As the discussion above, we construct Ei ⊆ E(H) and

Then |c(H1)| = (k − 2)nr−2

{v1i, w3, . . . , wr} ∈ E(H1) | k − 1 ≤ i ≤ n1 and ws ∈ Vs for 3 ≤ s ≤ r

1 + 1. By the
induction hypothesis, H1 is colored by conﬁguration φr−1. Without loss of generality, we assume
that in H1, E∗ =
are
colored by one color and all the remaining edges of H1 colored by distinct colors. Then, in H,
c(Ek−1,k−1) = · · · = c(En1,n1) = c(E∗), and the colors of the edges in E1,1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ek−2,k−2 are
diﬀerent from each other. Let H0 be the rainbow subhypergraph of H obtained by taking one
edge of each color of c(H) except c(E∗) and such that E1,1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ek−2,k−2 are contained in
H0. Then |E(H0)| = (k − 2)nr−1
. We have the following claim.
Claim 2. H0 ∼= Kk−2,n1,...,n1.
Proof. If H0 ≇ Kk−2,n1,...,n1, then there exists a (k − 1)-matching, denoted by M ′
by Theorem 6. Notice that M ′
we can ﬁnd an edge e′
then c(M ′

k−1 meets at most 2(k − 1) vertices in V1 ∪ V2 and n1 ≥ 2k − 1,

k ∈ E(H0). We also have

By Claim 2, there is a rainbow subhypergraph H0 ∼= Kk−2,n2,...,nr of H. Combining the
fact that all the edges in E(H)\E(H0) are colored by c(E∗), we deduce that H is colored by
conﬁguration φr.

We now prove Theorem 8.

Proof of Theorem 8. We ﬁrst prove that arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) = (k − 2)n2 · · · nr + 1 for n1 ≥
2k − 1 and k ≥ 3. Since φr is an edge coloring of Kn1,...,nr such that there is no rainbow
k-matching in Kn1,...,nr , arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) ≥ (k − 2)n2 · · · nr + 1.

The upper bound is proven by induction on the number of vertices of Kn1,...,nr . The base case
of n1 = nr is true by Lemma 10, we now suppose that n1 < nr. Assume the assertion holds for

all n′
i=1 ni. Suppose that H = Kn1,...,nr is a hypergraph with
a ((k − 2)n2 · · · nr + 2)-edge-coloring, and containing no rainbow k-matchings. Let H be the
representing hypergraph of H. Then e(H) = (k − 2)n2 · · · nr + 2. For any vertex v ∈ Vr, H − v
is a subhypergraph of some representing hypergraph of H − v. Since H − v contains no rainbow
k-matchings, by the induction hypothesis, we have

e(H − v) ≤ |c(H − v)| ≤ (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1(nr − 1) + 1.

Then dH (v) = e(H) − e(H − v) ≥ (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1 + 1. Thus,

e(H) =

which is a contradiction. Therefore, arr(Kn1,...,nr , Mk) = (k − 2)n2 · · · nr + 1.

Next we prove the uniqueness of the extremal coloring. Suppose that |c(H)| = (k−2)n2 · · · nr+
1 and H does not contain a rainbow k-matching. Then e(H) = (k − 2)n2 · · · nr + 1. We have
the following claim.

Claim 1. There exists a vertex v∗ ∈ Vr with dH (v∗) = (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1 + 1, and dH (v) =
(k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1 for v ∈ Vr\{v∗}.

Proof. For any vertex v ∈ Vr, H − v is a subhypergraph of some representing hypergraph of
H − v. If dH(v) ≤ (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1 − 1, then

|c(H − v)| ≥ e(H − v) ≥ (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1(nr − 1) + 2 = arr(Kn1,...,nr−1,nr−1, Mk) + 1.

By the induction hypothesis, H − v contains a rainbow k-matching, a contradiction. Thus,
dH (v) ≥ (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1 for all v ∈ Vr. Note that

e(H) =

X
v∈Vr

dH (v) = nr · (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1 + 1.

Therefore, there is exactly one vertex, say v∗, with degree (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1 + 1, and the
remaining vertices in Vr with degree (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1.

For v ∈ Vr\{v∗}, we have

e(H − v) = e(H) − dH (v) = (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1(nr − 1) + 1.

Clearly, H − v is a subhypergraph of some representing hypergraph of H − v. Thus,

|c(H − v)| ≥ e(H − v) = (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1(nr − 1) + 1.

By the induction hypothesis, |c(H − v)| ≤ (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1(nr − 1) + 1. Hence, we deduce
that |c(H − v)| = (k − 2)n2 · · · nr−1(nr − 1) + 1. By the induction hypothesis, H − v is colored
by φr since H − v contains no rainbow k-matchings. Due to the arbitrariness of v, for any two
vertices v1, v2 ∈ Vr\{v∗}, H − v1 and H − v2 are colored by φr. Assume S1 and S2 are the
(k − 2)-subsets of V1 such that the colors of the edges intersecting S1 and S2 are all diﬀerent in
H − v1 and H − v2, and edges not intersecting S1 and S2 are colored with a new color in H − v1

11

and H − v2, respectively. Then S1 = S2. So all edges intersecting S1 are colored with diﬀerent
colors in H and edges not intersecting S1 are colored with a new color in H. So H is colored
by φr. This completes the proof.
