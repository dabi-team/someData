ABSTRACT
RWT 152 is one of the few known planetary nebulae with an sdO central star. We present sub-
arcsecond red tunable ﬁlter Hα imaging and intermediate-resolution, long-slit spectroscopy
of RWT 152 obtained with OSIRIS/GTC with the goal of analyzing its properties. The Hα
image reveals a bipolar nebula with a bright equatorial region and multiple bubbles in the
main lobes. A faint circular halo surrounds the main nebula. The nebular spectra reveal a very
low-excitation nebula with weak emission lines from H+, He+, and double-ionized metals, and
absence of emission lines from neutral and single-ionized metals, except for an extremely faint
[N ii] λ6584 emission line. These spectra may be explained if RWT 152 is a density-bounded
planetary nebula. Low nebular chemical abundances of S, O, Ar, N, and Ne are obtained in
RWT 152, which, together with the derived high peculiar velocity (∼ 92-131 km s−1), indicate
that this object is a halo planetary nebula. The available data are consistent with RWT 152
evolving from a low-mass progenitor (∼ 1 M⊙) formed in a metal-poor environment.

Key words: planetary nebulae: individual: RWT 152 – hot subdwarfs – ISM: abundances.

1 INTRODUCTION

The formation of a planetary nebula (PN) is the last phase in
the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars ( initially 0.8-
8 M⊙) before they become white dwarfs. PNe exhibit a wide va-
riety of morphologies and properties that should be closely re-
lated to the evolution of their central stars (CSs). PNe host a di-
versity of CSs. Weidmann & Gamen (2011) compiled 26 spectro-
scopically well-distinguished types of CSs, that include, for ex-
ample, hybrid stars, O-type, and hot subdwarf stars (sdOs and
sdBs). However, there are only a few PNe known that host an
sdO CS. Aller et al. (2015a) (hereafter AM15), list 18 PNe around
sdOs CSs. Although this number is probably a lower limit be-
cause several CSs still lack a ﬁrm classiﬁcation as, e.g., NGC 1514
(Aller et al. 2015b) and NGC 6026 (De Marco 2009; Hillwig et al.
2010), the number of PN+sdO systems is very small as compared
with the large number of known sdOs without associated PNe (see,
e.g., Østensen 2006) and with the number of known Galactic PNe
(∼ 3000, Frew & Parker 2010). Intriguingly, PNe around sdO CSs

share some characteristics: they are generally evolved or relatively
evolved PNe (∼ 104 yr) with a very low surface brightness; most
of them present elliptical and bipolar shapes, often with multiple
structures, including signs of collimated outﬂows; and a high frac-
tion of conﬁrmed (or suspected) binary CSs is also observed in
these PN+sdO systems (for more details see AM15 and references
therein).

The existence of these common characteristics strongly sug-
gests a common formation process for these PNe as well. On the
other hand, the small number of these systems points out that some
peculiarities may be present in their formation. Among the vari-
ous evolutionary paths to explain the formation of an sdO star (see
Heber 2009), post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) evolution
appears as the most suitable one for those sdOs with PNe around
them. If so, the small number of these systems implies that PN
ejection is a rare evolutionary path for sdOs. However, as sdOs
are thought to represent the late stage of low-mass stars (see, e.g.,
Heber 2009), whose evolution proceeds very slow, the number of
PN+sdO systems could be biased due, at least in part, to the fact
that the shell ejected during the post-AGB phase could have dis-
persed before being photoionized. In any case, PN+sdO systems
are peculiar and their origin should be investigated. An interesting
approximation to study these systems is analyzing the properties

of the PNe themselves (e.g., morphology, chemical abundances),
which may provide clues about their formation and evolution.

RWT 152 (α(2000.0) = 07h 29m 58.s5, δ(2000.0) = −02◦ 06′ 37′′; l
= 219.◦2, b = 7.◦5) is one of the few PNe hosting a CS classi-
ﬁed as sdO (Ebbets & Savage 1982). This compact and faint PN
was originally discovered by Pritchet (1984) and has recently been
analyzed by AM15 by means of narrow-band imaging, and low-
and high-resolution long-slit optical spectra. The images by AM15
show a faint bipolar PN in the light of [O iii] while a diﬀuse, non-
spherical shape can be distinguished in the light of Hα. The anal-
ysis of the internal kinematics by AM15 showed a basic pattern of
bipolar motions, although these authors noticed some deviations
from a pure bipolar (hour-glass) shell, suggesting a more com-
plex morpho-kinematic structure. In addition, the polar velocity
of 19 km s−1 derived by AM15 and the published distances of 1.4
and 6.5 kpc (Ebbets & Savage 1982; Pritchet 1984, respectively) to
RWT 152, yield a kinematical age of ≃ 6.6 and 17.8 ×103 yr, re-
spectively, which suggests an already evolved PN. Finally, only
Hα, Hβ, and [O iii]λλ4959,5007 emission lines were detected in
the nebular spectra, which leaded AM15 to suggest a possible deﬁ-
ciency of heavy elements in the nebula. Conﬁrmation of this possi-
ble deﬁciency requires much deeper spectra given the faintness of
RWT 152. In addition, images at higher spatial resolution are nec-
essary to analyze its morphology in detail. In this framework, large
telescopes represent a very useful tool to carry out detailed anal-
yses of such faint PNe, since they provide very high-quality data
with relatively short-exposure times.

In this work we present subarcsecond red tunable ﬁlter imag-
ing and deep intermediate-resolution, long-slit spectra of RWT 152
obtained with OSIRIS/GTC, with the aim of studying the morphol-
ogy, physical conditions and chemical abundances of this PN. The
images reveal new structures not observed so far while the spectra
allow us to detect very faint nebular emission lines not previously
detected, allowing us estimates of the chemical abundances in the
nebula. The layout of the paper is as follows: in Sect. 2 we sum-
marize the observations and data reduction. Sect. 3 describes the
main results derived from the imaging and intermediate-resolution
spectra. A discussion of the results is done in Sect. 4 and the main
conclusions are summarized in Sect. 5.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

2.1 Optical imaging

Images of RWT 152 were obtained on 2013 November 6 in ser-
vice mode (proposal ID GTC4-13B) with OSIRIS (Optical Sys-
tem for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spec-
troscopy), mounted on the Nasmyth-B focus of the 10.4 m Gran
Telescopio Canarias (GTC), at the Observatorio Roque de los
Muchachos (La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain). The detector of
OSIRIS consists of two Marconi CCD42-82 (2048×4096 pixels)
with a 37 pix (binned) gap between them. The maximum unvi-
gnetted ﬁeld of view (FOV) is 7.8×7.8 arcmin. In order to increase
the signal-to-noise we chose the standard 2×2 binning mode which
provides a plate scale of 0.254 arcsec pixel−1.

The red tunable ﬁlter (RTF, Cepa et al. 2003, 2005) was used,
which covers the 6510–9345Å wavelength range. When using the
RTF, the user must select one of the available Order Sorter (OS)
ﬁlters in order to isolate the desired order. Thus, we selected the OS
ﬁlter f657/35 (i.e., that at central wavelength 6572 Å and FWHM of
350 Å) that provides a wavelength range of 6490–6600Å, with the

Figure 1. Transmission curves of the OS ﬁlter normalized at the peak trans-
mission for the six selected bands (labelled as λ1, λ2, λ3, etc.) are plotted in
black. The scaled nebular spectrum of RWT 152 (see Sect. 3.2) is overim-
posed in red and the position of the Hα and [N ii] emission lines is indicated
to highlight the contribution of these lines to the diﬀerent bands. The result-
ing band of adding each individual band is plotted in green. The inset shows

aim of covering the Hα and [N ii] λλ 6548,6584 Å emission lines
from the nebula. The RTF was sintonized with a full width at half-
maximum (FWHM) of 20 Å.

It should be noted that with the RTF the wavelength along the
FOV is not uniform, decreasing radially outwards from the optical
centre following the law

λ = λ0 − 5.04 × r(arcmin)2,

(1)

where λ0 is the central wavelength (in angstroms) and r the distance
to the optical centre (see Gonz´alez et al. 2014).

This quadratic decrease of the wavelength is particularly crit-
ical in extended objects such as PNe, since the light collected from
each point of the nebula comes from diﬀerent wavelengths de-
pending on the distance to the optical centre. Taking this into ac-
count, and as mentioned above, the observations were designed to
cover the Hα and [N ii]λ6548,6584 emissions from all the points
of RWT 152. The observing strategy was to obtain images with the
optical centre at six diﬀerent central wavelengths (λ0 = 6550, 6560,
6570, 6580, 6590, and 6600 Å), hereafter referred to as individual
bands. Figure 1 shows the transmission curves of the selected OS
ﬁlter normalized at the peak transmission centred at these individ-
ual bands (black lines) and the positions of the Hα and [N ii]λ6584
emission lines are indicated. The intermediate-resolution, long-
slit spectrum of RWT 152 (see Sect. 3.2) has also been plotted in
Fig. 1 to show the contribution of the Hα and the possible (very
faint) [N ii]λ6584 emission line detected. We note that the observed
ﬂux of the [N ii]λ6584 emission line is practically negligible, only
∼0.5% of Hα (see Sect. 3.2), thus making the Hα emission line
the main contributor in this OS ﬁlter. The CS of RWT 152 was
placed at ∼ 1 arcmin from the optical centre, corresponding to ∼
5 Å bluer than the central wavelength of each band (see equation
1). However, the small size of RWT 152 (see Sect. 3.1) implies that
the wavelength along the nebula hardly varies, so we can assume
that all points of the nebula are covered by approximately the same
wavelength. Therefore, for this particular case, by adding the im-

ages of all individual bands we obtain an Hα image of RWT 152.
Three images were taken in each individual band, each with an
exposure time of 80 s, allowing a dithering of ∼5 arcsec between
images to properly remove the diametric ghosts produced in the
images.

The images were reduced using the standard procedures
within iraf1. After correcting each individual frame from bias and
ﬂat-ﬁeld, the three images of each individual band were aligned
and median combined. Then, we added all images of all individ-
ual bands to obtain a deep Hα image within the total band plotted
as a green line in Fig 1. The total exposure time for the ﬁnal Hα
image is 1440 s (i.e., 6(bands)×3(images)×80 s) and the spatial res-
olution is 0.7 arcsec, as indicated by the FWHM of ﬁeld stars in the
image. Figure 2 shows the Hα image at two diﬀerent grey levels.
We note that the Hα image contains some contribution of the nebu-
lar continuum (see Fig. 1). Nevertheless, as we will see below, this
contribution is very small and the ﬁnal Hα image in Fig 1 can be
considered as representative of the “pure” Hα emission.

2.2 Intermediate-resolution, long-slit optical spectra

Intermediate-resolution, long-slit spectra of RWT 152 were ob-
tained with OSIRIS. The volume-phased holographic gratings
(VPHs) R2500U, R2500V, R2500R, R2500I were used. They cover

the spectral ranges 3440–4610, 4500–6000, 5575–7685, and 7330-
10000 Å, respectively, at dispersions of 0.62, 0.80, 1.04, and
1.36 Å pixel−1 (these dispersions are measured at central wave-
lengths for a slit width of 0.6 arcsec). The standard 2×2 binning
mode was used, which provides a plate scale of 0.254 arcsec
pixel−1.

Spectra were obtained on 2013 November 6 (R2500R,
R2500I) and 7 (R2500U, R2500V). The slit width was 0.8 arcsec
and the spectra were obtained with the slit oriented at PA 90◦ and
centred 7 arcsec south of the CS (see Fig. 2, left panel), covering
the southwestern lobe of the nebula. The exposure time was 1200 s
for each VPH and the seeing was ≃ 0.9 arcsec.

The spectra were reduced following standard procedures for
long-slit spectroscopy within the iraf and midas2 packages. The re-
duction included cosmic rays removal, bias subtraction and ﬂat-
ﬁeld correction. Then, the spectra were wavelength calibrated, sky
subtracted and, ﬁnally, ﬂux calibrated using the spectrophotometric
standard Hiltner 600. Some diﬀerences (less than 1%) were found
in the calibrated ﬂuxes of the standard star in the overlapping range
of the VPHs, which translate to the ﬂux calibration of the nebular
spectra. Nevertheless, these diﬀerences are within the uncertainties
of the ﬂux calibration process. Finally, we note that strong sky lines
in the nebular spectrum could not be completely removed, leaving
some residuals that prevent us from a clear identiﬁcation or mea-
surement of some nebular emission lines. This problem is particu-

most sky lines could not be removed (see Sect. 3.2).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Morphology

The high quality and subarcsecond resolution of the OSIRIS/GTC
Hα image (Fig. 2) allow us to describe new morphological struc-
tures in RWT 152 not detected so far, improving substantially the
previous description by AM15. The nebula shows a clear bipolar
morphology in the light of Hα with a size of ≃ 17×21 arcsec2 and
the major axis oriented at PA ∼ 45◦, that are compatible with the
size and orientation measured by AM15 in their [O iii] image. How-
ever, the new image reveals that the bipolar lobes are slightly dif-
ferent from each other, being the SW lobe broader than the NE one
and that they are composed by many bubbles, specially well deﬁned
in the SW lobe. No point-symmetric distribution of the bubbles is
noticed in the Hα image. The presence of these small bubbles may
explain the deviations from a pure hour-glass geometry observed in
the high-resolution, long-slit spectrum along the major nebular axis
(AM15).

The Hα image also shows that the equatorial region of the
bipolar shell is particularly bright (Fig. 2, more evident in the left
panel). To check the veracity of this structure and to discard pos-
sible eﬀects produced by the brightness of the CS, we inspected
the RTF image in the individual band with the optical centre at
λ6=6600 Å (see Fig. 3), where the emission should be dominated
by the nebular continuum, although with a small contribution of Hα
and even much smaller of [N ii]. In this image, the bright equato-
rial region cannot be recognized, indicating that this region corre-
sponds to a real nebular structure that is most probably associated to
the equatorial torus identiﬁed in the high-resolution, long-slit spec-
tra (AM15). In Fig. 2, the CS appears displaced ∼ 3 arcsec north-
wards with respect to the centre of the nebula. This value slightly
diﬀers from the displacement inferred from the high-resolution
spectra, where a shift of ≃ 1.4 arcsec towards PA ≃ 348◦ was ob-
tained (AM15). However, as the new image does not allow us to
trace clearly the torus, the displacement obtained from the high-
resolution spectra should be considered as a more precise value.

Finally, a very faint circular halo of ∼ 29 arcsec in diameter
can be recognized in the Hα image (see Fig. 2, right panel). Nei-
ther the main nebula nor the CS are centred in the halo but are
clearly displaced towards the northeast with respect to the geomet-
rical center of the halo. Displacements of a halo with respect to the
CS and PN have been traditionally attributed to interaction of the
PN with the ISM (see, e.g., Ramos-Larios & Phillips 2009). In the
case of RWT 152, the displacements suggest that the east/southeast
region of the halo is interacting with the ISM. Nevertheless, if so,
one would expect that the east/southeast part of the halo would be
the brightest one, which is not observed in our image. In addition,
the halo does not show departures from a circular symmetry, as it
could be expected from that interaction. Higher-resolution images
would be helpful to conﬁrm this possible interaction.

3.2 The optical spectrum: physical conditions and chemical

abundances

Figure 4 shows the intermediate-resolution, long-slit spectra of
RWT 152, both inner nebula (upper panel) and halo (lower panel),
obtained by combining the VPHs R2500U, R2500V and R2500R.

Figure 3. Grey-scale reproduction of the RTF image with the optical centre
at λ6=6600 Å, where the contribution of the Hα emission line is minimum
(see ﬁgure 1). Grey levels are linear.

The VPH R2500I is not shown here because of the strong con-
tamination by the sky lines (Sect. 2.2, but see also below). For
the case of the inner nebula, the spectra have been obtained by
integrating the detected emission lines between 4 and 6.4 arc-
sec west of RWT 152 along the slit. This region corresponds to
that showing the highest signal-to-noise ratio for the weakest lines
(e.g., [O iii]λ4363). Whereas only Hα, Hβ and [O iii]λλ4959,5007
emission lines had been previously detected in RWT 152 (AM15),
the long-exposure OSIRIS/GTC spectra reveal other faint neb-
ular emissions. In particular, [Ar iii], [Ne iii] and He i emission
lines are detected. The [N ii]λ6584 emission line could also be
present, although its extreme faintness (observed ﬂux ∼ 1.32
×10−17 erg cm−2 s−1) suggests to take this identiﬁcation with cau-
tion. In the VPH R2500I the [S iii]λλ9069,9532 emission lines
are clearly identiﬁed and relatively isolated from strong sky lines
whereas other faint emission lines ([Ar iii]λ7751, some Paschen
lines) could also be present. Emission lines due to [N i], [O i], [O ii]
and [S ii] are not identiﬁed. This result is entirely compatible with
the lack of these emission lines in the CAFOS spectra and allow
us to conclude that emission lines from neutral and single-ionized
metals are not present in the spectrum of RWT 152 (except for the
possible [N ii]λ6584 emission line). Finally, He ii emission lines are
neither identiﬁed.

The spectra of the halo (Fig. 4, lower panel) have been in-
tegrated in two 6.35 arcsec regions eastwards and westwards of
RWT 152 along the slit. These regions have been added to obtain
a higher S/N. Besides the Balmer and [O iii]λλ4959,5007 emission
lines, the spectrum of the halo also shows the He iλ5876 emission
line.

The spectra of the inner nebula have been analyzed using
the nebular analysis software Anneb (Olgu´ın et al. 2011), which
also integrates the nebular package of iraf/stsdas (Shaw & Dufour
1995), for deriving physical conditions and both ionic and ele-
mental abundances. A set of extinction laws are also included
and a proper error propagation is performed. Brieﬂy, Anneb ob-
tains the logarithmic extinction coeﬃcient c(Hβ) and the electron

R2500V and R2500R have been combined. The detected emissions lines are labelled. The inset in the upper panel shows the spectrum of the inner nebula in
the range 3800–4500 Å. For the case of the inner nebula, the spectra have been obtained by integrating the detected emission lines between 4 and 6.4 arcsec

temperature from the intensity ratio I(4959+5007)/I(4363) (i.e., Te
([O iii])), iteratively, starting with the values derived for Te = 104 K
and the theoretical Hα/Hβ line intensity ratio for case B recombi-
nation in the low-density limit (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006); then,
it derives the dereddened line intensities that are used to calculate
the values of c(Hβ) and Te ([O iii]) again. The process is repeated
until c(Hβ) and Te ([O iii]) converged to the ﬁnal values.

A value for the electron density (Ne) is also necessary for

c(cid:13) 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–10

the calculations. Unfortunately, the lack of the [S ii], [Ar iv] or
[Cl iii] emission lines from RWT 152 prevents us from deriving Ne
from the forbidden lines. Therefore, we have used the observed
ﬂux in Hα (F(Hα)) to calibrate the image and the formulation
by Hua & Kwok (1999) to calculate the mean electron density in

RWT 152. We considered a total ﬂux corrected for extinction3 of
F0(Hα) = 5.03 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1, observed in a region of 0.8
× 29 arcsec2 (deﬁned by the slit width and the angular size of the
nebula, including the halo), and obtained Ne = 91×D[kpc]−1/2. For
distances of 2.4 kpc (Ebbets & Savage 1982) and 6.5 kpc (Pritchet
1984), the electron density is 59 and 36 cm−3, respectively, with an
estimated error of about 10% in both cases. No particular diﬀer-
ences were noticed in the resulting parameters and ionic and ele-
mental abundances by using one or other of the derived electron
density values. We have adopted Ne = 50 ± 10 cm−3.

After the iteration procedure in Anneb, we obtain c(Hβ) = 0.59
± 0.04 (calculated from the Hβ and Hα ﬂuxes) and Te([O iii]) =
14000 ± 550 K, that are listed in Table 1. Anneb also provides the
c(Hβ) value calculated from other hydrogen lines, as Hγ, for which
a consistent value of 0.49± 0.10 is obtained. Also, the c(Hβ) ob-
tained for the halo (0.61± 0.04) is compatible with these results.
We note that all these values of c(Hβ) derived from the OSIRIS
spectra are slightly higher than (but still compatible with) that
obtained by AM15 (c(Hβ) ∼ 0.46), suggesting internal variations
of the extinction in the nebula. On the other hand, according to
Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998), E(B-V) towards RWT 152 is
∼ 0.1, implying c(Hβ) ∼ 0.15 (if Rv = 3.1 is assumed), that is
very diﬀerent from the value of ∼ 0.6 derived by us. This large
diﬀerence would imply a large amount of internal reddening in
the nebula, which would not be expected for such a low-density
nebula evolved from a low-mass progenitor (see Section 4.1). Al-
ternatively, the diﬀerence could be due to the existence of small
scale structure in the Galactic dust distribution towards RWT 152,
at scales well below ∼ 6 arcmin that is the spatial resolution of the
maps by Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998). If such a small scale
structure exists, it would be undetectable in the maps by Schlegel

3 For the calculations of Ne we have used c(Hβ) = 0.58, calculated from the
observed Hβ and Hα ﬂuxes, that is virtually identical to the value of 0.59
obtained after the iteration procedure with Anneb, see below.

et al. but could be revealed by observations at much higher spatial
resolution than 6 arcmin, as is the case of our spectra where we can
measured the extinction at spatial scales of a few arcseconds. In
any case, the extinction towards RWT 152 deserves further investi-
gation.

Table 1 lists the observed emission line ﬂuxes and dereddened
emission line intensities and their Poissonian errors, both for nebula
and halo spectra, where the emission line ﬂuxes have been dered-
dened with c(Hβ) = 0.59 and the extinction law f (λ) of Seaton
(1979). We further note that the use of other extinction laws (e.g.,
Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis 1989) does not produce appreciable
diﬀerences in the dereddened emission line intensities and other
parameters.

The absence of the He iiλ4686 emission line and the [O iii]/Hβ
line intensity ratio of ≃ 8 (Table 1) indicate a very low-excitation
PN, with an excitation class of 2 according to Gurzadian & Egikian
(1991). We note that RWT 152 was erroneously classiﬁed as a
relatively high-excitation PN by AM15. The very low-excitation
is compatible with the relatively low eﬀective temperature of the
CS of RWT 152 (≃ 45000 K, Ebbets & Savage 1982). In these cir-
cumstances, the non-detection of neutral and single-ionized emis-
sion lines (e.g., [S ii], [O i], [N i], [O ii]) and the extremely faint-
ness of the (possible) [N ii]λ6584 emission line is highly peculiar
for this excitation class. Under these conditions, one could expect

that emission lines due to, e.g., O0, O+, S+, N0, were prominent
even though the abundances of O, S, N were low. This spectrum
can be understood if RWT 152 is a density-bounded PN with no
low-excitation region (at least along the bipolar lobes, because the
equatorial structure has not been studied). In fact, [O i], [N ii], [S ii]
emission lines become very weak in density-bounded models (see
Gesicki & Zijlstra 2003), and, in addition, a PN becomes optically
thin if the eﬀective temperature of the CS is in the range 40000–
50000 K (Kaler & Jacoby 1991), as it is the case of RWT 152.

The derived ionic abundances (i.e., the number density ratio
relative to the H+ number density), calculated as a weighted aver-
age by the signal-to-noise ratio of each line for species with more
than one line, are listed in Table 2. To obtain the helium abundance,
we used the method by Kwitter & Henry (2001), while for the ar-
gon abundance, we followed the method by Kingsburgh & Barlow
(1994) and used an icf = 1.87, since no [Ar ii] is observed. These
helium and argon elemental abundances are listed in Table 3, where
ǫ(X/H) = log(X/H) + 12 is given (being 12 the hydrogen number
density).

For the rest of the elements, the absence of some emission
lines prevents to calculate the icfs and, therefore, the elemental
abundances. Nevertheless, the low eﬀective temperature of the CS
and the observed spectrum allow us to make some reasonable as-
sumptions to obtain approximate values for the abundances. In par-
ticular, the lack of He ii and [Ar iv] emission lines in the spectra
makes it highly improbable that ionization states as O3+ and Ne3+
may exist in the nebula. This, and the absence of emission lines
from O0, O+, and Ne+ in the spectrum of RWT 152 strongly sug-
gest that O2+ and Ne2+ are the dominant excitation states. In conse-
quence, their ionic abundances may be considered as representative
of their elemental abundances and those are listed in Table 3.

In the case of sulfur, if we assume that the ionic abundance
of S2+ is representative of the elemental sulfur abundance, the el-
emental abundance would be 5.46. However, this assumption is
probably erroneous for sulfur because even if He ii and [Ar iv]
emission lines are unseen, faint [S iv] emission lines, as, e.g.,
at 10.52 µm, may be detected in infrared spectra of some low-
excitation PNe with relatively cool CSs. In fact, the existence of
O2+ (ionization potential = 35.1 eV) suggests that S3+ (ioniza-
tion potential = 34.8 eV) may also exists in RWT 152. This is the
case of K 648, a very similar object to RWT 152, with an sdO
central star of Teﬀ = 37000 K Otsuka, Hyung & Tajitsu (2015);
Heber, Dreizler & Werner (1993); Bianchi et al. (2001). As far as
we know, there is no available infrared spectrum of RWT 152.
Therefore, for comparison purposes, we have estimated the contri-
bution of [S iv] to the total abundance of sulfur in the case of K 648
with the data provided by Otsuka, Hyung & Tajitsu (2015). Our
calculations show that the elemental abundance of sulfur reported
by Otsuka, Hyung & Tajitsu (2015) is reduced by ∼ 15% if the con-

tribution of the [S iv]λ10.52 µm emission line is not considered. If
we assume a similar contribution of a (possible) [S iv]λ10.52 µm
emission line to the total abundance of sulfur in RWT 152, the value
of 5.46 would increase to 5.52. From these calculations and taking
into account the diﬀerences between K 648 and RWT 152, we will
consider in Table 3 a value for the elemental sulfur abundance in
RWT 152 of 5.52 ± 0.08, where the error is probably an upper limit
to the actual error.

Finally, the nitrogen abundance in RWT 152 is the most un-
certain one. We note that N2+ may exist in the nebula since other
especies with higher ionization potential, like O2+, are also de-
tected. We have inspected the International Ultraviolet Explorer
(IUE) spectra of RWT 152 to search for the presence of the semi-
forbidden N iii] λλ1747,1754 emission lines. However, there is no
traces of these emission lines although they should be prominent if
the abundance of N is within the range of values observed in PNe.
Therefore, it seems that N2+ does not exist in the nebula. Taking
this into account and that emission lines due to N0 neither exist,
the N abundance should be similar to the abundance of N+ and this
is quote in Table 3. Nevertheless, given the extreme faintness of
the [N ii]λ6584 (see above), the existence of nitrogen in the neb-
ula is questionable and, in any case, the elemental abundance in
Table 3 should be considered as an upper limit. This result is very
surprising for a PN. Nitrogen may not have been produced during
the evolution of RWT 152 by the second dredged up. However, this
mechanism alone hardly explains the extremely low N abundance
or, even, its absence in RWT 152. As additional possibilities we
may consider that RWT 152 has been formed in a very nitrogen-

8

poor environment and/or that nitrogen is depleted (forming part of
grains). In any case, a reasonable explanation has not been found.
Table 3 shows low elemental abundances of metals, conﬁrm-
ing the previous suggestion by AM15. We will discuss below the
implications of these elemental abundances. It is worth noting that
the low metal abundances found in RWT 152 provides strong sup-
port for a deﬁciency in metals in 2M 1931+4324, another PN+sdO
system with a nebular spectrum very similar to that of RWT 152
(Aller et al. 2013, see also above).

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Chemistry and evolutionary status of RWT 152

To obtain information about the progenitor of the CS of RWT 152,
it is interesting to classify RWT 152 according to the Peimbert
(1978) types. Peimbert (1978) classiﬁed PNe into four types on
the basis of their chemical composition, spatial distribution and
kinematical properties. Type I PNe are those with high He and N
(He/H > 0.125; log(N/O) > -0.30, see Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert
(1983)) and they are the youngest population. Type II PNe are the
intermediate population, generally older than type I PNe and, there-
fore, more deﬁcient in heavy elements and without He and N en-
richments. Type III PNe belong to the thick disk and present pe-
|> 60 km s−1, which is the diﬀerence
culiar velocities of | ∆Vpr
between the observed radial velocity and that expected on the ba-
sis of Galactic rotation (assumed circular). Finally, type IV PNe are
halo objects with | ∆Vpr |> 60 km s−1 and log (O/H)+12 6 8.1; they
correspond to the oldest population.

The helium abundance derived for RWT 152 (He/H ∼ 0.140,
Table 3) indicates a type I or type II PN. However, the extremely
low (or absent) nitrogen abundance rules out these two types. A
comparison of the abundances of O, S, Ar and Ne with those typ-
ical of type III and type IV PNe, shown in Table 3, indicates that
RWT 152 is a type IV PN. To reinforce this classiﬁcation, we show
in Figure 5 the 12+log(S/H) versus 12+log(O/H) diagram for the
four Peimbert types of PNe, in which RWT 152 is placed in the re-
gion of halo PNe. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the helium
abundance in RWT 152 appears high for type IV PNe, although
some halo PNe do present relatively high helium abundances, as,
e.g., M 2-7 with He/H ∼ 0.137 (Quireza, Rocha-Pinto & Maciel
2007).

resulting value is ∼ 92 - 131 km s−1 for distances of 2.4 kpc
and 6.5 kpc, respectively, in any case > 60 km s−1 (see above),
conﬁrming the type IV classiﬁcation for RWT 152. Finally, we note
that the height above the Galactic plane of RWT 152 is 0.2–0.8 kpc
for the mentioned distances. Although type IV PNe are usually
located at z > 0.8 (Peimbert 1990), other halo PNe are located at
comparable heights above that plane (see Pereira & Miranda 2007,
and references therein). Summarizing, the chemical abundances
and the peculiar velocity add RWT 152 as a new member of the
few known halo PNe.

that the progenitor was formed in a poor-metal environment. In
contrast, similar models of initial mass ∼ 1.25 M⊙ and Z = 0.004
by Karakas (2010) predict abundances substantially diﬀerent from
those found in RWT 152. Even for the lowest metallicity in the
Karakas models (Z = 0.0001), we do not recover the chemical
abundances of RWT 152. Therefore, it is clear that drawing con-
clusions about the progenitor star of RWT 152 from the chemical
abundances of the nebula may be a bit misleading. For this reason,
we have obtained information about the progenitor from the cur-
rent status of its CS. Figure 6 shows the position of RWT 152 in
the HR diagram log g − Teﬀ with the post-AGB tracks by Bloecker
(1995) and Schoenberner (1983). The location of the star (Teﬀ ≃
45 000 K, log g ≃ 4.5; Ebbets & Savage 1982) is consistent with a
current mass of M∼0.55 M⊙ which implies an initial mass in the
main sequence of ∼ 1 M⊙. For such a low-mass star, the ejected
mass during the AGB evolution is expected to be small. In fact,
with the electron density derived above and the size of the neb-
ula we obtain values of 1.3×10−2 - 1.6×10−1 M⊙ for the ionized
nebular mass (assuming 2.4 and 6.5 kpc, respectively, and a ﬁlling
factor of 0.6). These values are much smaller than ionized masses
usually obtained for PNe (see, e.g., Hua & Kwok 1999), further
supporting a low-mass progenitor for RWT 152. Moreover, taking
into account that 0.1-0.3 M⊙ are lost in the RGB phase of a low-
mass star (Dorman, Rood & O’Connell 1993), the current mass of
the CS and the obtained ionized mass, we recover a progenitor star
with a ∼ 0.8-1.0 M⊙, in agreement with the value obtained from
the position of the CS in the log g − Teﬀ diagram. Such a low ion-
ized mass, combined with a relatively high kinematical age, may
explain the low surface brightness of RWT 152. If a low-mass pro-
genitor is involved in the evolution of other PNe+sdO systems, it
is not surprising that these PNe are very faint and, in some cases,
may have faded beyond detection.

A comparison of the He and O abundances in RWT 152 with
evolutionary models of stellar yields by Marigo (2001) suggests
a progenitor star with an initial mass of ∼ 1.3 M⊙ and very low
metallicity Z = 0.004. The stellar mass is compatible with that ex-
pected for sdOs (Heber 2009) and the low metallicity indicates

4.2 The morphology of RWT 152

The GTC image shows that RWT 152 presents multiple bubbles
in its bipolar lobes. The number of PNe with multiple bubbles
(or lobes) has largely increased, mainly due to increasing reso-

c(cid:13) 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–10

lution of imaging capabilities. PNe with multiple bubbles/lobes
can be classiﬁed in two broad categories: (1) those with a point-
symmetric distribution of the bubbles/lobes as, e.g., NGC 6058
(Guill´en et al. 2013), starﬁsh-like PNe (Sahai 2000), and other
young PNe (Sahai & Trauger 1998); and (2) those with a random
(non-point-symmetric) distribution of the bubbles/lobes as, e.g.,
NGC 1514 (Ressler et al. 2010), NGC 7094 and Abell 43 (Rauch
1999). RWT 152 seems to be an intermediate case: it shares with
NGC 1514 and Abell 43 the random distribution of the bubbles
but also shares with starﬁsh PNe the existence of a bright equa-
torial region (torus) separating two main lobes (or multiple point-
symmetric lobes).

Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the pres-
ence of multiple bubbles/lobes, including bipolar jets at several
directions with variable ejection velocity (e.g., Vel´azquez et al.
2012), interaction of a fast wind with a warped circumstellar disk
(Rijkhorst, Mellema & Icke 2005), and interaction of a fast wind
with a inhomogenous spherical shell (Steﬀen et al. 2013). Multi-
ple point-symmetric bubbles/lobes appear more compatible with a
bipolar jet model or warped disk model than with an inhomoge-
nous shell scenario; the latter would require an extremely point-
symmetric density distribution in the spherical AGB shell, which
could be diﬃcult to explain. PNe with randomly distributed bub-
bles could be better explain by an inhomogenous shell. In the case
of RWT 152, the random distribution of the bubbles points out to a
model in which a dense equatorial torus exists in the spherical shell
while the rest of the shell presents an inhomogenous density dis-
tribution. Alternatively, wind interaction with a warped disk could
also explain random bubbles if material in the two sides of the disk
is distributed in a inhomogenous manner. Nevertheless, a deﬁnitive
conclusion about the shaping of RWT 152 is diﬃcult to be reached
because it is an already evolved PNe and the original shaping mech-
anism could be masked by other processes (e.g., hydrodynamical
instabilities). Images of RWT 152 at higher spatial resolution and,
in particular, of its equatorial region would be very useful to com-
plete description of the nebula.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented OSIRIS/GTC red tunable ﬁlter Hα imaging and
intermediate-resolution, long-slit spectroscopy of RWT 152, one of
the few known PNe hosting an sdO central star. The data, obtained
at subarcsec spatial resolution, allowed us to describe the detailed
morphology and to obtain the physical conditions and chemical
abundances of the nebula. The main conclusions of this work can
be summarized as follows:

(1) The new Hα image shows that RWT 152 is a bipolar PN with
a bright equatorial torus, surrounded by a circular halo. The
bipolar lobes consist of multiple bubbles with a non point-
symmetric distribution. The center of the halo does not coin-
cide with the center of nebula and with the central star, sug-
gesting interaction of the halo with the interstellar medium.
(2) The nebular spectra reveal very faint [Ar iii], [Ne iii], He i,
[S iii] emission lines, which had not been previously detected.
Emission lines due to neutral and single-ionized metals are not
detected, except for an extremely faint [N ii]λ6584 emission
line, while the lack of He ii emission lines indicates that high
ionization states (e.g., O3+, S3+, N3+) are probably not present
in the nebula. These results strongly suggests that RWT 152 is
a density-bounded PN, at least in the direction of the bipolar
lobes.

(3) An electron temperature Te([O iii]) of ∼ 14000 K and a very
low electron density Ne ∼ 50 cm−3 have been obtained for the
nebula.

(4) Except for helium, the derived chemical abundances of S, O,
Ne and Ar are low. The abundance of N seems to be extremely
low and an explanation for this fact has not been found yet. The
low abundances and the high peculiar velocity of the object
(| ∆Vpr |∼ 92-131 km s−1) strongly suggest that RWT 152 is a
halo PN, adding a new member to the small number of known
PNe in this type.

(5) A comparison of the atmospheric parameters of the CS with
post-AGB evolutionary tracks suggests a ∼ 1.0 M⊙ progenitor
for RWT 152, that should be formed in a metal-poor environ-
ment. This low-mass progenitor is compatible with the small
ionized nebular mass (1.3×10−2 – 1.6×10−1 M⊙) obtained for
RWT 152.

(6) The multiple, non-point-symmetric bubbles observed in the
bipolar lobes could be attributed to interaction of a fast wind
with an inhomogeneous distribution of material at both sides
of the equatorial torus. Nevertheless, as RWT 152 is an already
evolved PN, the original mechanism for the formation of the
multiple bubbles could be masked by other phenomena that
have occurred through the evolution.
