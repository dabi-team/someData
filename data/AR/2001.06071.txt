Abstract

Time it takes to travel from one position to another, devoid of any quantum mechanical description,
has been modeled variously, especially for quantum tunneling. The model time, if universally valid,
must be subluminal, must hold everywhere (inside and outside the tunneling region), must comprise
interference eﬀects, and must have a sensible classical limit. Here we show that the quantum travel
time, hypothesized to emerge with the state vector, is a function of the probability density and
probability current such that all the criteria above are fulﬁlled. We compute it inside and outside a
rectangular potential barrier and ﬁnd physically sensible results. Moreover, we contrast it with recent
ionization time measurements of the He as well as the Ar and Kr atoms, and ﬁnd good agreement
with data. The quantum travel time holds good for stationary systems, and can have applications in
numerous tunneling-driven phenomena.

Introduction

Tunneling, transport of subatomic particles through the regions of space forbidden to classical motion, is a pure
quantum phenomenon. It is a ubiquitous eﬀect that underlies numerous physical [2], chemical [18], biological [19]
and technological phenomena [20].

Tunneling time, the time elapsed during the tunneling process, is crucial for determining reaction speeds of tunneling-
enabled rare processes, which range from nuclear fusion [17] to quantum annealing [53]. In fact, with the advent
of strong laser ionization experiments [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], it has now become possible to measure time of tunneling
[26, 27], where certain metrological problems [28, 11] with the detection of the tunneling particle were shown to be
surmountable [29, 30]. Strong laser ﬁelds enable electrons to tunnel out of atoms, where the potential barrier formed
forms a testbed for models of tunneling time [31, 32]. In fact, recent single-electron ionization time measurements
on He [15] (see also the more recent analysis [16]), and Ar and Kr [3] have shown that tunneling takes a ﬁnite time
(100 as) and this
(via study of the Ar and Kr ionizations in [3]). These experiments are sensitive to tunneling times
precision is suﬃcient to test various tunneling time models. It is diﬃcult to contrast theory and experiment, however.
First, construction of the ionization potential in multi-electron atoms is highly complicated though, in this context,
single-active-electron (SAE) approximation [13, 14, 8] gives a satisfactory framework. (In our analyses below, we
adopt the SAE potential given in [8, 9].) Second, stationarity of tunneling process brings limitations like, for example,
the ionizing laser ﬁeld must be suﬃciently static (period of the laser ﬁeld must be much larger than the tunneling time).
Stationarity poses also a conceptual problem in that one must be able to set up a time measure (tunneling time) for a
stationary process. Stationarity poses yet another problem in that potential loses its static nature in a duration about
the laser period after the completion of tunneling process. (Sec. II and IV below take into account all these critical
points.)

O

The time, not only the tunneling time, is an intricate concept in quantum theory. The problem is that, in quantum
theory, time is not a dynamical variable representable by an operator. It is not a measurable quantity. It therefore
is model-dependent and depends on the kinetic theory set forth for the tunneling process. The literature consists

 
 
 
 
 
 
A preprint - January 20, 2020

of various time deﬁnitions, as reviewed in [33, 34, 35, 36]. They include traversal time through modulated barriers
[37, 38, 39, 40], spin precession time [41, 42, 43], ﬂux-ﬂux correlation duration [44], phase time [45, 46, 47], and
Feynman path integral (FPI) averaging of the classical time [48, 49, 50]. Some of them are complex, some are diﬃcult
to associate with tunneling process, and some suﬀer from superluminality [4, 51]. More importantly, they (excepting
FPI time with experiment-driven coarse-grained paths) fail to explain the experimental data, as was comparatively
analysed and experimented in [15]. Nevertheless, two recent time deﬁnitions, the entropic tunneling time [52] and
uncertainty-based tunneling time [54], are subliminal and agree well with He ionization data.

In the present work, we propose and study a new time model which holds both inside and outside the potential barrier.
This we do by structuring time as a function of the position of the particle (through its wavefunction), and guiding
it with the Schrödinger equation. Our deﬁnition, which we call quantum travel time (QTT), diﬀers from those in
the literature by its suitability for stationary processes like tunneling (Sec. II), its comprehensiveness for reﬂected
and transmitted particles (Sec. III), its capability to hold everywhere (Sec. II and III), and its compatibility with
experiment (Sec. IV). Indeed, in Sec. II below state the QTT. In Sec. III we study tunneling through a rectangular
potential barrier as an illustrative example and as a testbed for physical consistency of QTT. In Sec. IV, we contrast
QTT with the experimental data on He [15] and Ar and Kr [3] ionization times, and ﬁnd fairly good agreement. In
Sec. V we conclude.

2 Quantum Travel Time

Our approach to time is novel in that it covers time elapsed both inside and outside the tunneling region. It is inspired
by time in quantum gravity. More precisely, it uses timelessness of the Hamiltonian general relativity (GR) [55, 56]
as the starting point, with no real involvement of classical or quantized GR in its construction. The GR is timeless
because it is background independent [57]. Indeed, the Hamiltonian of 3-metrics H vanishes identically

H = 0

(1)

as a dynamical constraint. It means that dynamical variables in phase space are all time-independent. Everything is
frozen.

The constraint (1), upon quantization, leads to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation

ψ
. This equation can be taken to imply, as in the classical theory, a strictly
as a condition [56] on the state vector
i
time-independent state vector. This, however, is not the only way. Indeed, the same equation can interpreted as the
Schrödinger equation for the stationary state

with vanishing energy (E = 0). This reinterpretation makes a case that times does actually exist but is erased by vanish-
ing energy. Unlike the classical Hamiltonian GR in which no dynamical variable possesses explicit time dependence,
the quantized GR allows the possibility that timelessness is a result of the energylessness. In fact, if the quantum
gravitational system gets excited by some interactions (with matter, for instance) then time should emerge as in (3)
thanks to non-vanishing E. In essence, the time t should be a quantum property as it emerges together with the state
ψ
vector
. It is, however, not possible to disentangle it through (2) due to vanishing of energy in quantum gravity
i
[56, 33]. It needs be structured separately.

|

If time is to gain an observable status it must be related to observable quantities (position, momentum, energy,
) in
a measurable way. In this regard, the canonical quantum gravity setup in (2), with the state vector (3), gives ground
for a possible realization of observable time. It gives because t and
are born together and t, as a c-number, must be
related to the wavefunction ψ(~x, t) =
as a functional relation t = t(ψ(~x)). Then, the trivial relation dt/dt = 1

such that ψ  is the wavefunction propagating in the   direction, that is, ~
~p ψ  (the momentum ~p  along
∇
  can be local or global, as was detailed in [52]). The equation (4), resulting from quantum generalization of d~x/dt,
is recognized to resemble the guiding equation in Bohmian mechanics [58]. This reversible relationship lays the
foundation for a proper formulation of time in quantum theory. Indeed, equation (4) governs how the time t = t(ψ(~x))
emerges along with ψ(~x) not how the trajectory ~x(t) actualizes to kill the probabilistic nature of quantum behavior [58].
The time t = t(ψ(~x)), direct line integral over ~J−

  (ρ  + ρ!), makes sense only as temporal separations between the
points ~xa, ~xb,
are made. Hereon, we call the time deﬁnition (4) as quantum
travel time (QTT) to emphasize the fact that particle “travels" rather than traverses in face of forward and backward
probability currents.

be confused with dwell time [41], which focuses on total probability ρ and total current
to determine duration of
scattering irrespective of if the particle is reﬂected or transmitted [59]. Our deﬁnition in (7), the QTT, is not a dwell
time but a traversal time. (The dwell time turns out to be superluminal as discussed in the next section, with the
example of rectangular potential barrier.)

In the following we will use the time formula (7) to compute time elapsed during potential scatterings. We ﬁrst apply it
to scattering form a rectangular potential barrier (in Sec. III below). Next, we apply it to single electron ionization from
He, Ar and Kr atoms, and contrast the results with the available experimental data (in Sec. IV). Our time deﬁnition
naturally applies to stationary systems and, as will be seen in the sequel, it yields physically sensible results and shows
satisfactory agreement with data.

3 QTT For Rectangular Potential Barrier

In this section we apply the time formula (7) to rectangular potential scattering by considering the incident, reﬂected
and transmitted waves separately.

For an insightful analysis of the QTT (7), it proves convenient to study scattering from a rectangular potential barrier.
The setup, illustrated in Fig. 1, involves a particle of mass m and energy E incident on a rectangular potential barrier
of height V0 > E from the region I (x < xL). It can be reﬂected back to its incidence region I or it tunnel through

Having determined probability and probability current, our time formula (7), the QTT, enables one to determine time
it takes to get from x = a to x = b > a in any region in Fig. 1. It holds everywhere, inside and outside the barrier. In

of them, the entropic tunneling time of [52], the phase time of [45] and the dwell time of [41] are based solely on
the potential V(x), and can therefore be unambiguously contrasted for the rectangular potential barrier in Fig. 1. The
entropic tunneling time is based on a statistical approach and holds only in the tunneling region [52]. The phase time

the absence of a wave packet peak in the tunneling region [33]) and the time it would take to traverse xR
xL in the
absence of barrier via the classical motion (this piece is added by hand not formulated). Obviously, the QTT produces
this "added-by-hand" piece naturally in the regions I and III, and shows that there is no such thing in region II. The
dwell time, already discussed below equation (7), concerns how long the particle stays in a domain. The entropic,
phase and dwell times possess the asymptotic limits

as also conﬁrmed by Fig. 3. The phase time, too, remains subluminal but this happens thanks to the added-by-hand
classical time in (19). The phase time suﬀers from superluminality and, more strikingly, the ﬁnite value it takes as
xR
, meaning that the particle tunnels through an inﬁnitely wide and high potential
barrier instantaneously. This eﬀect, the Hartman eﬀect [4], renders the dwell time unphysical.

In summary, the QTT holds in all three regions I, II and III and leads to physically sensible results. What remains is to
contrast it with experiment, and that we do in the next section.

4 QTT In Tunnel Ionization of Atoms

In this section, we contrast QTT with the formation duration of the tunneling-enabled He+, Ar+ and Kr+ ions [15, 3].

In the setup [3], laser pulse propagates along positive z axis, with the electric ﬁeld

E(t) =

E0 f (t)[cos(ωt)ˆx + ζ sin(ωt)ˆy]

(23)

−

such that f (t) = cos4(tπ/τ), E0 =
I(1 + ζ2), ω = 0.035, τ = 156 fs, and ζ = 0.85. Here τ is the period of the laser
ﬁeld (much larger than tunneling duration) and ζ sets the elliptic polarization of the electric ﬁeld. It is clear that for
πτ
times t
2 the envelope f (t) remains practically unity (static electric ﬁeld) and stationarity of tunneling is ensured.

namely there exists no interference (more correctly, overlap) between the forward and backward propagating waves
inside the tunneling region. This means that the particle entering from xL proceeds en route to xR, with no possibility of
derailing to a backward propagating wave (as was also utilized in [52]). The two probabilities are disjoint with no over-
lap [12, 39]. This enables us to deﬁne right and left currents explicitly and calculate travel time QTT straightforwardly.

The energy conﬁguration behind the Schrödinger equation (29) is depicted in Fig. 4.The three regions I, II, III, having
a similar meaning as those in Fig. 1, correspond to three diﬀerent propagation regimes for the electron. The region
I, overwhelmed by the Coulombic singularity at the position of the nucleus, is skipped by the tunneling dynamics
in that Ve f f (η) attains its maximum when the laser intensity is maximum (corresponding to t = 0 at which electric
ﬁeld strength equals E0). For this reason, time calculation starts not with ηL but with ηI in Fig. 4 at which Ve f f (η) is
maximum (or current density is maximum). To see this, we plot in Fig. 5 the probability current density J+ ˆη in (38).
It is clear that maximum of the potential (η = ηI) changes from atom to atom, with the obvious fact that the region I
remains tiny for each atom.

Figure 6: The He ionization time as modelled by (QTT)ηRηI and as measured by the VMIS and COLTRIMS spectrom-
eters [15].

The tunneling time measurements are based on ionization of atomic electrons through laser-controlled potential barri-
ers. The intense laser pulse (around 1014 W/cm2) turns the Coulomb potential into a potential barrier as in Fig. 4 so
that a valence electron can tunnel to continuum, in which it continues to be accelerated by the laser ﬁeld which itself
varies with time as in (23). The measurement of the He ionization time in [15] is based on momentum distribution of
the continuum electrons (as measured by COLTRIMS and VMIS spectrometers). The technique involves extraction
of the phase of the electric ﬁeld at the tunnel exit (ηR in Fig. 4) from electron’s momentum distribution, and takes
into account Coulombic and drift corrections. The main stage of the extraction is the determination of the phase angle
that leads to the wavepacket whose peak gives the most probable electron trajectory [15] (see also the recent review
[16]). This He ionization data can be used to determine how realistic the QTT is. The tunnel exit should be taken near
the fall of probability density current, for a proper comparison. The results are shown in Fig. 6 where superimpose
(QTT)ηRηI in (36) on the experimental data (Fig 3 (b) of [15]). It is clear that there is good agreement between the QTT
and the experimental data. The slight diﬀerence between the two is expected on the grounds that modeling of the He
ionization are diﬀerent in the experiment of [15] and in the Schrödinger equation (29). The experiment, to our under-
standing, sets the ionization energy as I(exp)
2.5 controls the tunnel
ionization regime [31, 32]) and determines tunneling time transition of electron from ηL to ηR with that Ip = I(exp)
.
Atomically, however, the ionization energy I0
p is precisely known and improved ionization energy Ip involves E0 via
only the correction terms in (27). Moreover, tunneling dynamics can be known and ensured only beyond ηI (not ηL)
[3], and that is the point used in (QTT)ηRηI in (36). Despite there diﬀerences, however, QTT and the experimental
data show good agreement and, with increasing experimental and theoretical precision (going beyond the WKB, for
instance) the closeness in Fig. 6 can turn into a complete agreement.

The comparative measurement of the Kr and Ar ionization times in [3], which is an eﬃcient method for eliminating
various systematic and statistical eﬀects, focuses on the continuum electron trajectories. The continuum electrons are
assumed to follow classical laws of motion (in contrast to [15], which assumes a wavepacket), and electron trajectories
are found to explain the data if there is a time delay in the potential barrier. They adopted phase time [45, 46] in their
analysis. Our approach diﬀers form theirs in two aspects:

1. We use the QTT in the tunneling region, and

2. We continue to use the QTT in the continuum.

In the tunneling region, for Kr ionization, the phase time formalism gives 138 as at I = 1.08

QTT is found to be 133, 116 and 68 as, respectively (see Fig.7). The two times remain close to each other throughout.
Here, it should be noted that phase time pertains to the dominant path along the tunneling channel but the time within
the tunneling region is pure imaginary (see the discussions in [33, 52]). This feature ensures that the Wigner time
in [3] is dominantly the one coming from the overall real-time phase of the propagator, and corresponds to the time
added by hand in (19). This feature is what makes time to grow almost linearly with the barrier width (see Fig. 2(b)
of [3]). In essence, therefore, the closeness between the QTT and the phase time results from mainly the overall phase
of the kernel corresponding to the added-by-hand time amount in (19).

The (QTT)ηRηI curves in Fig. (7), plotted for each of He, Kr and Ar, combines He with the other atoms and give a clear
view of how tunneling time changes from atom to atom. The separation between the He and the other two reveals
the impact of the eﬀective potential (30) (to the exent it can be applied to low-Z atoms like He). The closeness of the
Kr and Ar curves, on the other hand, justiﬁes the experimental technique employed in [3] in that various systematic
eﬀects can indeed be discarded by experimenting two atoms simultaneously. The drop in the Kr tunneling time at
large intensities (related to its dipole structure) agrees with the results of [3]. It may be concluded that QTT has the
potential to be reliably applied to tunnel ionization of diﬀerent atoms.

After traversing the region II (completion of tunneling process), the continuum electron continues to propagate in
region III of the potential landscape in Fig. 4. The scattering process continues to maintain its stationary character for
propagation duration suﬃciently short compared to the laser period τ = 156 fs, and QTT can safely be employed as

The ﬁrst diﬀerence above is not hard to make sense, given the behavior of the phase time. The second point is,
however, more subtle. Speaking speciﬁcally, we have not been able to reproduce Fig. 2 (a) of the [3] even with their
parameters; their plots seem to involve some kind of rescaling and shifting. Concerning this diﬀerence, assuming
the validity of the SAE potential throughout, it should be emphasized that probability conservation ensures continuity
of the wavefunction and its ﬁrst derivative, and this ensures that QTT ﬂows continuously across a boundary but its
derivative (the second derivatives of the wavefunction) does not have to be continuous, and thus, time outside the
barrier (region III) can grow with a diﬀerent rate than the one in the tunneling region (region II).

5 Conclusion

In this work we have proposed a new time formula – the quantum travel time – which holds everywhere (inside and
outside the tunneling region) and which applies directly to stationary processes (systems with conserved energy, like
the tunneling process). We analyzed the QTT in rectangular (Sec. III) and atomic (Sec. IV) potential conﬁgurations,
and shown that the QTT leads to physically acceptable results with good agreement with experimental data (despite
the use of WKB approximation).

We should emphasize that the QTT has the potential to give reliable predictions of time elapsed in quantum systems
(including tunneling-driven processes). It can be applied (and tested this way) to various biological (like DNA damage),
chemical (like astrochemistry) and physical systems (diodes to the formation of the Universe). Our analysis shows
that the QTT can lead to realistic predictions in each of these tunneling-driven phenomena.
