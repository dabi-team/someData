If the mass excess of neutron-deﬁcient nuclei and their neutron-rich mirror partners are both
known, it can be shown that deviations of the Isobaric Mass Multiplet Equation (IMME) in the
form of a cubic term can be probed. Such a cubic term was probed by using the atomic mass
of neutron-rich magnesium isotopes measured using the TITAN Penning trap and the recently
measured proton-separation energies of 29Cl and 30Ar. The atomic mass of 27Mg was found to
be within 1.6σ of the value stated in the Atomic Mass Evaluation. The atomic masses of 28,29Mg
were measured to be both within 1σ, while being 8 and 34 times more precise, respectively. Using
the 29Mg mass excess and previous measurements of 29Cl we uncovered a cubic coeﬃcient of d =
28(7) keV, which is the largest known cubic coeﬃcient of the IMME. This departure, however, could
also be caused by experimental data with unknown systematic errors. Hence there is a need to
conﬁrm the mass excess of 28S and the one-neutron separation energy of 29Cl, which have both
come from a single measurement. Finally, our results were compared to ab initio calculations from
the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group, resulting in a good agreement.

INTRODUCTION

Local atomic mass models have been widely used
to predict unknown masses of neutron-deﬁcient nuclei,
which are relevant for astrophysical processes such as the
rapid-proton capture process [1] and the prediction of
long-lived di-proton radioactivity [2]. One of the most
robust and successful of such models is the Isobaric Mass
Multiplet Equation (IMME) [3, 4]. This model makes
use of the isospin symmetry in the nucleus that is bro-
ken due to the Coulomb interaction. The IMME states
that the mass excess (ME) of Isobaric Analogue States
(IAS) in a given nuclear multiplet will follow a quadratic
dependence with the isospin projection Tz = (N − Z)/2
of the form:

ME(A, T, Tz) = a(A, T ) + b(A, T )Tz + c(A, T )T 2
z ,

(1)

where a, b, and c are coeﬃcients that depend on the
total number of nucleons A in the isobaric group, and
the isospin value T of the IAS.

In the past decades, several cases violating the IMME
were reported [5, 6] before more precise measurements
of other members of the multiplets re-established the va-
lidity of the IMME [7, 8]. Among the 35 fully deter-
mined quartets and quintets that can test the IMME
[4], only the A = 8 [9], 9 [10], 21 [11], 31 [12, 13], 32
[14], and 35 [15] currently depart enough from quadra-
ture to require the presence of a higher-order term in
the IMME. In all these systems, the departure could be
justiﬁed by the presence of a cubic term of size ranging
from -4.3(11) keV [11] to 8.47(14) keV [4]. It is impor-
tant to know for which isobaric chains additional cubic or
quartic terms are required as otherwise the IMME will
fail in providing accurate prediction on unknown mass
of neutron-deﬁcient nuclei. In this article we report an
indirect determination of what would be the largest cu-
bic coeﬃcient in any given multiplet. This determination
is based upon new high-precision mass measurements of
magnesium isotopes along with recent proton-separation
energy measurements of 29Cl and 30Ar [16].

a 97 ms excitation.

clotron frequency νc = qB/(2πm) of the ion of in-
terest was determined via the time-of-ﬂight ion cy-
clotron resonance technique [32, 33] (TOF-ICR). A typi-
cal quadrupole resonance for the most neutron rich mag-
nesium isotope, 29Mg, is shown in Figure 1.

III. DATA ANALYSIS

The atomic masses of our ions of interests were derived
from the ratio of the cyclotron frequency of a calibrant
ion νc,ref over the cyclotron frequency of the ion of inter-
est νc: R = νc,ref /νc. The cyclotron frequency νc,ref is
a linear interpolation of two calibrations bracketing the
measurement of the ion of interest in order to account
for long-term magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. Figure 2 shows
all the 27−29Mg+ to 23Na+ frequency ratios taken. Note
that a 997 ms excitation was used for all 27−28Mg+ mea-
surements and the ﬁrst three 29Mg+ measurements. The
last ten 29Mg+ measurements were performed using a 97
ms excitation. The Birge ratios [34] for the three mea-

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

The atomic masses of 27−29Mg were measured using
TRIUMF’s Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TI-
TAN) Penning trap mass spectrometer [17, 18], located
at the ISAC facility [19, 20]. Penning trap mass spec-
trometry is well established as a tool of choice for preci-
sion mass measurements of radioactive isotopes [21]. The
radioactive, neutron-rich magnesium isotopes were pro-
duced by impinging a 480 MeV, 40 µA proton beam on a
thick SiC target. For our measurements laser resonance
ionization in a radiofrequency ion guide (IG-LIS) was
chosen. This allows to suppress surface ionized species
from the hot target and transfer tube region. Only neu-
tral atoms can eﬀuse into the cold RF ion guide region,
where element selective resonant laser ionization occurs
[22].

The TITAN facility currently consists of three ion
traps: a radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) cooler and
buncher [23], an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) [24] to
charge-breed the ions for increased precision [25, 26] as
well as to perform in-trap decay spectroscopy [27], and
the mass measurement Penning trap (MPET) [28]. Re-
cently, the system has been used for a series of precision
mass measurements with goals ranging from improving
nuclear matrix element calculations for double-beta de-
cay experiments [29] to unveiling discrepancies in reac-
tion rates for the rp-process [30], and to test new isospin
symmetry breaking calculation methods for superallowed
pure Fermi transitions [31]. For the neutron-rich magne-
sium isotope measurements, the mass-selected radioac-
tive beam from the IG-LIS [22] was ﬁrst accumulated in
the RFQ, where it was cooled through collisions with a
helium buﬀer gas and subsequently extracted as bunches.
The cooled bunches were then sent directly to MPET as
singly charged ions.

Once the ions were injected into MPET, the ion cy-

Table I gives the weighted average of the frequency ratios.
Most systematic uncertainties in the measured fre-
quency ratios scale linearly with the mass diﬀerence be-
tween the ion of interest and the calibrant ion [28].
These systematic eﬀects include: magnetic ﬁeld inho-
mogeneities, trap misalignment with the magnetic ﬁeld,
harmonic distortion of the electric potential and non-
harmonic imperfections in the trapping potential. The
combination of these systematic eﬀects was experimen-
tally determined to be ∆R/R = -0.2(2) ppb · ∆A for
singly charged ions at TITAN [28]. Hence in the data
analysis a conservative upper value of 0.4 ppb · ∆A was
added in quadrature as systematic error. The remaining
systematic eﬀects stem from non-linear, time-dependent
changes in the magnetic ﬁeld, relativistic eﬀects on the
cyclotron frequency, and ion-ion interaction in the trap
[35], which are explained in the following.

First, the ﬁeld produced by the superconducting mag-
net is aﬀected by variations of temperature and pressure.
This was minimized at TITAN by using a pressure sta-
bilization system, resulting in temporal magnetic ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations that are typically below 0.15 ppb/h [35]. Be-
cause the calibration measurements were separated by
less than 75 minutes, the eﬀect of magnetic ﬁeld varia-
tions on the cyclotron frequency are negligible compared
to our achieved statistical uncertainty. Second, relativis-
tic eﬀects were also calculated, and found to be negligi-
ble compared to our statistical precision, due to the ion’s
large mass-to-charge ratio [35].

Then, the measured cyclotron frequency of the ion of
interest can be aﬀected by the presence of contaminant
ions of diﬀerent mass [36]. These ions, which are not af-
fected during the excitation phase, do interact with the
ion of interest resulting in a reduction of the measured
cyclotron frequency. Possible isobaric contamination was
probed by doing a scan of a dipolar excitation [37] at
the reduced cyclotron frequency and no contaminant was
found. Non-isobaric contaminants from the oﬀ-line ion
source or produced by charge-exchange in the RFQ were
removed using a Bradbury-Nelson gate [38] upstream of
the Penning trap. Finally, undesirable species can be cre-
ated from charge-exchange with residual background gas
molecules or radioactive decay in the Penning trap itself.
Hence, throughout the experiment, we kept the maxi-
mum number of recorded ions below two. Nevertheless,
an upper value for possible shifts in the frequency ratios
due to ion-ion interactions was probed by performing a
count-rate analysis [39] on each individual time-of-ﬂight
spectrum. In this analysis, cyclotron frequencies extrap-
olated down to one ion detected were obtained. Because
of the small number of counts in each spectrum, a pre-
cise estimate of the change in frequency was obtained
by taking the diﬀerence between the weighted average
of frequencies from the count-rate analysis with the un-
corrected frequencies. These frequencies, together with

the variation in frequency are within uncertainty. Nev-
ertheless, using the frequency shifts for the Mg isotope

ratio can be estimated using

Finally, previous higher precision measurements us-
ing stable isotopes have uncovered a systematic eﬀect
amounting to 1.3 ppb due to an unbalanced RF being
applied to the Penning trap electrodes [29], which has
since been resolved. The contributions of the various
forms of uncertainty are summarized in Table III. As it
can be noticed the systematic uncertainty is dominated
by our conservative estimate for mass-dependent eﬀects,
which is still lower than the statistical uncertainty in the
measurements.

where mref is the atomic mass of 23Na and me is the
electron mass. The corresponding mass excess ME, cal-
culated using the 23Na mass excess from the 2016 Atomic
Mass Evaluation (Ame2016) [40], is presented in Table
IV together with the Ame2016 value. The 27Mg ME is
within 1.6σ of the Ame2016 value, which is based on a
series of 27Mg(n,γ) measurements [40]. The 28Mg ME
agrees with the Ame2016 value, which is based on a β-
end point measurement [41], while being 8 times more
precise. The 29Mg ME also agrees with the Ame2016
value, which is based on a measurement done with the
MISTRAL spectrometer [42], while being 34 times more
precise.

V. DISCUSSION

As discussed in [2], the mass excess ME(A,T ,−|Tz|) of a
very proton-rich nucleus can be obtained from knowledge
of the mass excess, ME(A,T ,Tz), of its mirror partner
using only the b coeﬃcient of the quadratic form of the
IMME:

ME(A, T, −|Tz|) = ME(A, T, Tz) − 2b(A, T )|Tz|.

(4)

Here we propose, in a new technique, to reverse the sit-
uation and use the known mass of a very proton rich
nucleus and its mirror partner to probe for a potential
cubic term in the quartic form of the IMME:

which where measured recently. These measurements
prompted interest as they indicate that 30Ar would un-
dergo a very unique type of hybrid decay between a si-
multaneous emission of two protons and their sequential
emission [16]. This unusual type of decay has been ar-
gued to be caused by an interplay of three- and two-body
decay mechanisms [16].

To extract a reliable cubic term, the b coeﬃcient was

calculated using the following parametrization [4]:

bparam(A, T ) = ∆nH −720·Sb(T )·

+Cb(T ), (6)

where ∆nH = 782.346 64(48) keV is the diﬀerence be-
tween the mass of the neutron and the proton [40], 720
keV is obtained from a global ﬁt of the data on IAS, Sb(T)
is an isospin-dependent correction to that global value,
and Cb(T) is an isospin-dependent oﬀset [4]. The values
of Sb and Cb for the multiplets of interest are given in Ta-
ble V. This b coeﬃcient evaluation was also corrected for
the general residuals ∆b of the parametric ﬁts observed
in the region of interest (around A = 30):

b(A, T ) = bparam(A, T ) + ∆b(A).

This was done using our newly measured 29Mg mass ex-
cess, the mass excess of 30Mg previously measured at
TITAN [43], which are the neutron-rich mirrors of 29Cl
and 30Ar, respectively. For this analysis, the mass ex-
cess of 29Cl and 30Ar were taken from Ame2016 [40].
These mass excesses are based on the two-proton sep-
aration energy of the drip-line nucleus 30Ar (S2p = -
2.25+0.15
−0.10 keV), and the one-proton separation energy of
its isotonic neighbor 29Cl (Sp = -1.8 ± 0.1 keV) [16],

The residuals of the b coeﬃcient parametrization, to-
gether with the spline interpolation of their ﬁve-point
moving average, are shown in Figure 3. The standard
deviation of the diﬀerence between the interpolation and
the residual was found to be 22 keV and it is indicated
by the dotted lines in Figure 3. Note that the spread of
the residuals around A = 30 is covered by the 22 keV
standard deviation.

The b coeﬃcient, the mass excess of 30Ar, and 29Cl,
as well as the d coeﬃcient estimate for their respective
multiplets are compiled in Table V. The calculated cu-
bic term for the A = 30, T = 3 multiplet is 10(5) keV,

which is 2σ from zero and the cubic term for the A = 29,
T = 5/2 multiplet is 28(7) keV, which is 4σ from zero.
The latter cubic term is much greater than any other cu-
bic term observed to date. Such a departure could be
a consequence of the Thomas-Ehrman eﬀect observed in
unbound systems [44]. If this is the case, it would rep-
resent the largest shift of this kind, as the cubic terms
in lighter systems with unbound nuclei (A = 8, 9) are at
most 8.5 keV.

Another possibility would be that the large cubic terms
are due to erroneous experimental data. For example, in-
creasing the mass excess of 28S, which is used to calculate
the mass excess of both 30Ar and 29Cl in the Ame2016
(since the original data [16] is in the form of neutron
separation energies), by 700 keV would re-establish the
quadratic behavior of the IMME. Note that the mass
excess of 28S is derived entirely [40] from the Q-value
measurement of the reaction 28Si(π+,π−)28S [45], hence
a conﬁrmation of the mass excess, preferably using direct
means would help solidify the presence of the large cubic
coeﬃcient.

To further shed light on this observation, we calculated
the IAS energies of the A = 29, 30 multiplets from valence-
space in-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-
SRG) [46–49], based on two-nucleon (NN) and three-
nucleon (3N) forces derived from chiral eﬀective ﬁeld
theory [50, 52]. Two diﬀerent starting chiral Hamilto-
nians were used in this work. The ﬁrst (SRG 2.0) uses
a chiral NN interaction at next-to-next-to-next-to lead-
ing order (N3LO) [51, 52] and a 3N force at N2LO [53],
simultaneously evolved with the free-space SRG [54] to
a low-momentum scale of λ = 2.0fm−1 in a single parti-
cle spherical harmonic oscillator (HO) basis with energy
(cid:126)ω = 24 MeV. As discussed in Refs. [48, 49], this Hamil-
tonian reasonably reproduces experimental ground and
excited state energies in the lower sd shell. The second

interaction (SRG 1.8), developed in Refs. [55–57], begins
from the same chiral N3LO NN interaction as above, but
with λ = 1.8fm−1. Unconstrained 3N couplings cD and
cE are subsequently ﬁt to reproduce the triton binding
and alpha particle charge radius at Λ3N = 2.0fm−1. This
Hamiltonian, which predicts well saturation energy of in-
ﬁnite symmetric nuclear matter [55], has recently been
shown to reproduce ground-state energies across the nu-
clear chart from the p shell to the nickel region and be-
yond [57–60].

We then use the Magnus formulation of the IM-SRG
[61, 62] to decouple the 16O core energy as well as a spe-
ciﬁc sd-shell valence-space Hamiltonian for each nucleus
of interest, using the ensemble normal ordering procedure
[49], which captures the bulk eﬀects of 3N forces among
the valence-space nucleons. These Hamiltonians are di-
agonalized using the NuShellX shell-model code [63] and
the IAS are identiﬁed using the isospin, parity and an-
gular momentum quantum numbers, obtained from this
process.

Corrections of the isospin mixing in the energies are
performed under the assumption of two-level mixing of
the states. We calculated the mass excess of the 29Mg
and the 30Mg ground states, as well as the IAS in 29Al,
29S, 29Cl, 30Al, 30Cl and 30Ar within a HO basis size
of e = 2n + l ≤ emax = 12 and 3N matrix elements
where e1 + e2 + e3 ≤ E3max = 14. The energies of the
IAS were extrapolated in emax and E3max and the coef-
ﬁcients of the IMME calculated from the results. This
extrapolation procedure was checked for consistency by
comparing results to an extrapolation of the coeﬃcients
directly calculated from the IAS for increasing emax and
E3max values.

Final results are shown in Table VI. The theoretical
ME values of the Mg nuclei deviate from experimen-
tal data, but results using the SRG 1.8 interaction are

in much better agreement. This is expected since SRG
2.0 is known to overbind nuclei above oxygen isotopes
[64], while SRG 1.8 largely reproduces ground state en-
ergies in this region [57]. The IMME coeﬃcients for both
interactions are consistent with each other and repro-
duce well the experimental results. The b coeﬃcient for
SRG 1.8 is even within 100 keV of experiment for both
cases, though such an accuracy is well beyond what might
be reasonably claimed given unexplored interaction and
many-body uncertainties. For SRG 2.0, b is overesti-
mated on the order of 150 to 350 keV. For completeness,
an experimental c coeﬃcient was also calculated using the
multiplet-speciﬁc ﬁt functions from [4]. The c coeﬃcient
calculated from SRG 1.8 for A = 29 is nearly identical to
the value based from the ﬁt of all the known multiplets.
For A = 30 on the other hand, SRG 1.8 under predict
that coeﬃcient by about 50 keV. For both interactions
the d coeﬃcient only diﬀers by a few keV from experi-
ment. Considering the ﬂuctuations in the coeﬃcients of
lower order and the diﬀerent signs in the cubic coeﬃcient
for A = 29, we conclude that such agreement is acciden-
tal, and the determination of cubic contributions to the
IMME is not yet possible at a level of precision com-
parable to experiment. The consistency of the results,
however, highlights the need to further study of the ef-
fects of diﬀerent interactions and to explore estimates of
uncertainties from approximations in the many-body ap-
proach. Such work is currently in progress [65].

VI. CONCLUSION

We performed direct mass measurements of neutron-
rich magnesium isotopes 27−29Mg using the TITAN Pen-
ning trap mass spectrometer at the ISAC radioactive
beam facility at TRIUMF. The 27Mg mass excess is
within 1.6σ of the Ame2016, the 28,29Mg mass excesses
are both within 1σ of the Ame2016, while being respec-
tively 8 and 34 times more precise. Using the new mass
excess of 29Mg, the previously measured mass excess of
30Mg at TITAN, and the recent proton-separation energy
measurements of 29Cl and 30Ar, we calculated the IMME
cubic coeﬃcient for the A = 29 and 30 multiplet using
a novel approach. For both cases signiﬁcant non-zero
coeﬃcients of 28(7) keV and 10(5) keV, respectively are
obtained. In the case of A = 29, the coeﬃcient is much
larger than any other cubic term previously obtained ex-
perimentally. While ab initio valence-space IM-SRG cal-
culations also ﬁnd nonzero d coeﬃcients, precision at the
tens of keV level is well beyond what can be claimed
currently. Since such a large breakdown of the IMME
might be partly caused by inaccurate experimental data,
an independent conﬁrmation of the 28S mass excess, and
the 29Cl one-proton separation energy would help better
understand the nature of the large cubic term uncovered.
