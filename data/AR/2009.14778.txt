ABSTRACT: Polycrystalline bulk Mn:ZnO ceramics with Mn nominal concentrations of 6, 11, 

17 and 22 at.% were prepared trough solid-state reaction method and subjected to a heat treatment 

in  reducing  atmosphere  (Ar  (95%)  and  H2  (5%)).  The  samples  were  studied  with  particular 

emphasis on their compositions, structural, and magnetic properties.  A detailed microstructural 

and chemical analysis confirms the Mn doping of the wurtzite ZnO structure mainly at the surface 

of the ZnO grains. For the samples with higher Mn content, the secondary phases ZnMn2O4 and 

Mn1−xZnxO  (Zn-doped  MnO)  were  detected  for  the  as  prepared  and  the  heat  treated  samples, 

respectively. The structural change of the secondary phases under heat treatment, from ZnMn2O4 

to  Mn1−xZnxO,  confirms  the  effectiveness  of  the  heat  treatment  in  to  reduce  the  valence  of  the 

metallic ions and in the formation of oxygen vacancies into the system. In spite of the induced 

defects,  the  magnetic  analysis  present  only  a  paramagnetic  behavior  with  an  antiferromagnetic 

coupling between the Mn ions. In the context of the bound magnetic polaron theory, it is concluded 

that oxygen vacancies are not the necessary defect to promote the desired ferromagnetic order at 

room temperature.

INTRODUCTION 

ZnO  is  a  true  multifunctional  material,  it’s  a  nontoxic  abundant  resource  with  superior 

environmental affinity, which is drawing much  attention. With a wide bandgap (3.4 eV) and  a 

strong binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature [1], the ZnO has been explored in different 

applications  and  technologies  like  in  photocatalysis  [2],  as  potential  thermoelectric  material  in 

energy harvesting devices [3], in gas sensing systems [4] and also in photovoltaic elements [5], 

just to cite few. The functionalization of such materials is mainly achieved via defect engineering, 

by doping or even by the introduction of defects into the structural lattice in a proper and controlled 

way [6].   

In such context, special attention has to be deserved to the magnetic properties of ZnO. It’s a 

diamagnetic  material  and  its  magnetic  functionalization  takes  place  via  doping  with  magnetic 

elements or by associating it to magnetic materials as in core-shell systems [7]. Magnetic ZnO at 

nanoscale has been explored in biomedicine as a bioimage agent or as a drug deliver [7], and also 

in  antibacterial  complexes  [8].  Besides,  magnetic  ZnO  is  also  a  promising  dilute  magnetic 

semiconductor (DMS) to be used as a spin injection layer in spintronic devices. The research on 

transitional metal (TM) doped ZnO for spintronic purposes has been launched after the theoretical 

report by Dietl et al. [9]. According to these authors, wide band gap semiconductors, Mn-doped 

ZnO  and  GaN,  would  show  Curie  temperatures  (TC)  above  room  temperature  and  presenting, 

therefore, a room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM). However, in spite of the experimental and 

theoretical  efforts  of  the  last  decades,  the  knowledge  of  about  the  magnetic  properties  of  such 

materials, especially concerning the TM-doped oxides, are still controversial and inconclusive. By 

now, there is a consensus that the structural defects play an important role to tune the functional 

2 

 
properties of the oxides, particularly their magnetic properties [10-14]. Considering the case of the 

TM-doped ZnO, one can find on the literature several reports connecting an observed RTFM to 

different structural point defects like zinc vacancies (VZn) [15, 16], zinc interstitial (Zni) [13, 17] 

and oxygen vacancies (VO) [18, 19]. Among these defects, VO are widely believed to have a major 

role in promoting the desired RTFM [19-23]. A very often used technique to promote VO into the 

wurtzite ZnO (w-ZnO) structure is the heat treatment in low-oxygen [24, 25], inert [26, 27] or in 

reducing  atmospheres  [27-29].  However,  under  heating,  the  vaporization  of  ZnO  takes  place 

predominantly via dissociation into gaseous Zn and O2 [30], and, therefore, heat treatments ends 

also  promoting  defects  at  Zn  sites,  and  not  only  leading  to  VO.  For  instance,  Meng  et  al.  [31] 

showed that Al and Mg co-doped w-ZnO under heat treatment in forming gas (97% N2 and 3% 

H2) at 650 °C for 1 h can completely remove the Zn from the samples, leaving behind a dominant 

Mg oxide phase. 

From the theoretical point of view, different models have been proposed to explain the usual 

observed RTFM in DMS’s. Here, the main accepted model for insulating systems is the bound 

magnetic polaron (BMP) theory proposed by Coey et al. [32], who argued that the ferromagnetic 

exchange among the TM doping elements is mediated by shallow donor electrons that form bound 

magnetic polarons, which overlap to create a spin-split impurity band. Nevertheless, high stable 

polarons  can  also  be  formed  by  holes  bounded  to  acceptor  defects  into  oxides  [33,  34],  and 

magnetic polarons can also be formed into insulating doped DMS’s [35] and, for extension, into 

TM-doped w-ZnO [36]. Since VO are theoretically predicted to be a deep donor defect in the w-

ZnO [37], VO can be associated to observed RTFM under the scope of the BMP model, as it has 

been done. However, VZn is a shallow acceptor defect [37] and has also to be considered.  

3 

 
In this scenario, one can address the raised controversy mainly to the lack of knowledge in the 

nature and the control of the densities of defects in the studied materials. Therefore, the aim of the 

present report is to give further contribution to the understanding of the Mn incorporation into the 

w-ZnO structure, and shine some light over the question about the nature of the necessary defects 

to promote and stabilize the desired RTFM in ZnO-based DMS’s. We conducted a detailed study 

of  the  microstructure  and  the  magnetic  properties  of  Mn:ZnO  bulk  samples  with  Mn  nominal 

concentrations of 6, 11, 17 and 22 at.% prepared by the standard solid-state reaction method. The 

samples  were  prepared  under  oxygen  atmosphere  and,  after  all,  fraction  of  the  samples  was 

subjected  to  a  heat  treatment  in  a  reducing  atmosphere  of  Ar  (95%)  and  H2  (5%)  in  order  to 

introduce defects in the samples in a very controlled way. We found that, in spite of having induced 

VO  via  the  reducing  heat  treatment,  the  samples  only  present  a  paramagnetic  behavior  with 

antiferromagnetic interaction among the Mn ions. 

2  EXPERIMENTAL 

Polycrystalline Mn:ZnO bulk samples with Mn nominal atomic concentrations of xN = 0.06, 

0.11, 0.17 and 0.22 (6, 11, 17 and  22 at.%) were prepared via standard solid-state reaction method. 

Properly  stoichiometric  amounts  of  ZnO  (Alfa  Aesar  99.999%  purity)  and  MnO  (Alfa  Aesar 

99.99%  purity)  powders  were  mixed  and  ball  milled  for  5  h  using  Zn  spheres.  The  resulting 

mixtures were cold compacted at a pressure of 600 MPa in the form of pellets (green pellets). The 

green pellets were finally sintered in oxygen atmosphere at 1400 °C for 4 h. These samples were 

labeled as “as prepared” (AP) samples. Fraction of these samples were then heat treated in reducing 

atmosphere of Ar (95%) and H2 (5%) (Ar + H2) at 600 °C for 3 h.  These samples were labeled as 

4 

 
“heat  treated”  (HT)  samples.  Figure  1  presents  a  flowchart  of  the  procedure  employed  in  the 

preparation and characterization of the samples.  

The structural characterization and the effects of heat treatment of the Mn:ZnO bulk samples 

were  investigated  by  powder  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  using  Rigaku  Ultima  IV  equipment 

employing Cu Kα radiation (30 kV, 40 mA, λ = 1.5418 Å) recorded in the range of  2θ = 15 – 

120° with steps of 0.02° at 7 s/step. The determination of the lattice parameters and the occupation 

factor over the structure were evaluated by using the Rietveld method implemented via General 

Structure  Analysis  System  (GSAS)  with  the  graphical  user  interface  EXPGUI  [38,  39].  The 

microstructure was determined using Scanning electron microscope (SEM)-LV JEOL JSM 6510 

with  resolution  of  3  nm  at  30  kV.  The  effective  Mn  concentration  (xE)  incorporated  into  the 

hexagonal w-ZnO structure was estimated by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), using 

an  Oxford  XMAX  50  detector.  Raman  scattering  spectroscopy  was  employed  to  study  the 

incorporation of Mn and the resulting lattice disorder in the w-ZnO host structure, as well as to 

analyze the formation of segregated secondary phases. Raman measurements were acquired by 

using  an  IHR-550  Horiba  Jobin  Yvon  spectrometer  equipped  with  a  Synapse  Charge  Coupled 

Device (CCD) detector, an Olympus BX41 microscope, and by using a 10× and 100× objective 

lenses in the backscattering configuration. The spectra were collected in several different points 

for each sample in order to enhance the statistical analysis. The excitation was performed with a 

532  nm  wavelength  laser,  with  laser  power  of  1  mW  over  the  sample.  X-ray  absorption 

spectroscopy  (XAS)  analysis  was  employed  to  determine  the  oxidation  state  (XANES  –  X-ray 

Near-Edge Spectroscopy) and to assess the environment (EXAFS – Extended X-ray Absorption 

Fine Structure) of the Mn atoms in the Mn:ZnO samples. These measurements were performed at 

the Mn and Zn K-edge in transmission mode using a Si (111) channel-cut monochromator at the 

5 

 
XAFS2 beamline of the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS). Finally, the temperature-

dependent  (3-300  K)  magnetic  measurements  were  performed  by  using  a  Cryogenics 

Superconducting Quantum Interference Device magnetometer (SQUID) in DC mode in magnetic 

fields up to 6 T.

3  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

3.1 X-ray diffraction: Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results for the Mn:ZnO 

samples as a function of the Mn nominal content (xN). The observed peaks correspond to those 

expected for polycrystalline hexagonal w-ZnO, space group P63mc (PDF 01-072-8025) [40]. The 

relatively narrow line-widths revealed a highly crystalline quality for all samples. For the samples 

with xN = 0.06, AP and HT, it was not observed, within the detection limit of the measurements, 

6 

 
 
 
any  indication  of  additional  phases.  However,  for  the  samples  with  xN  greater  than  6  at.% 

segregated phases were identified (symbols in Figure 2). For the AP samples the secondary phase 

zinc (II) dimanganate (ZnMn2O4) was identified (PDF 01-071-2499). After the heat treatment in 

the reducing atmosphere, samples HT, the ZnMn2O4 secondary phase almost disappears, and the 

manganese  (II)  oxide  (MnO)  secondary  phase  takes  place  (PDF  01-075-1090).  The  ZnMn2O4 

phase  has  a  tetragonal  spinel  structure  (AB2O4  formula)  in  which  the  Zn2+  occupies  the  AO4 

tetrahedral sites (Td), and the Mn3+ occupies the BO6 octahedral sites (Oh). The crystal structure of 

ZnMn2O4  spinel  belongs  to  the  I41/adm  space  group.  Besides,  the  MnO  has  a  cubic  rock-salt 

structure with Mn2+ ions at octahedral sites, space group Fm3(cid:2)m. This result indicates, as expected, 

a  reduction  of  the  oxidation  state  of  the  Mn3+  to  Mn2+  with  the  heat  treatment  in  the  Ar  +  H2 

atmosphere.  

Figure 2. XRD pattern of the polycrystalline Mn:ZnO bulk samples prepared with different Mn concentration for the (a) AP and 
(b) HT samples. Stars show the peak positions of the segregated ZnMn2O4 phase in (a), and the crosses show the peak positions of 
the MnO segregated phase in (b).  

The obtained Rietveld structural parameters are presented in the supplementary file (Figures 

S1, S2 and Tables S1 and S2). The main results concern the calculation of the fraction of the phases 

(w-ZnO, ZnMn2O4 and MnO) and the site occupation factors for each element in each phase. As 

the  nominal  concentration  of  Mn  increases  (xN),  the  diffraction  peaks  corresponding  to  the 

7 

 
 
 
 
secondary phases increase with respect to the peaks of the w-ZnO structure. The refined fraction 

of the phases revealed alinear behavior with the xN (Figure S3(a) in the supplementary file). We 

call attention to a small fraction of remain ZnMn2O4 phase into the HT samples (Table S2). The 

refined occupation factor for the Mn in the w-ZnO matrix, addressed as xR, is presented in Table 

1.    It  is  stated  that  xR  correspond  to  the  Mn  limit  of  solubility  in  the  w-ZnO  lattice  under  the 

preparation conditions used in this study. First, we observe that xR are in good agreement with the 

effective Mn concentration (xE) measured via EDS (Table 1). We also observe that xR increases as 

the xN also increases.  This result is corroborated by the linear increase of the refined volume of 

the w-ZnO unit cell as a function of xR, as expected under the Vegard’s law (Figure S3(b) in the 

supplementary file).  The increase of the incorporated Mn concentration (xR) into the w-ZnO will 

be further interpreted as a function of the changes in the grain growth conditions under the presence 

of higher amounts of the MnO precursor. 

3.2  Electron  Microscopy  and  Elemental  Analyses:  Figure  3(a)  and  Figure  3(b)  show 

representative scanning electron microscope (SEM) images acquired over the polished surface of 

the Mn:ZnO samples. The images were acquired using a backscattered electron detector (BSE) in 

order  to  highlight  the  secondary  phases,  ZnMn2O4  (AP)  and  MnO  (HT).  It  is  observed  in  the 

microscale range the increase of the number and the size of the secondary phases (dark gray grains 

in  Figure  3(a)  and  Figure  3(b))  as  the  xN  increases,  in  accordance  with  the  XRD  and  Rietveld  

results. Series of full scans over large areas at the samples AP and HT for xN = 0.06 reveal the 

presence of a very small amount of secondary phases that was not detected in the XRD (red arrows 

in Figure 3). This finding can explain, in part, the slightly lower values obtained for xR and xE as 

compared to the xN (Table 1). This observation also highlights the limitation of the XRD technique 

in  detect  secondary  phases  even  in  the  microscale  range.  For  instance,  in  the  context  of  the 

8 

 
developing true DMS’s it is hardly important to exclude the presence of any source of magnetic 

secondary phases that could leads to misinterpretations about the magnetic behavior. Therefore, 

for  this  purpose  it  is  necessary  to  conjugate  different  experimental  techniques  and  use  highly 

sensitive tools in nanometric scale.  

Figure  3.    Representative  scanning  electron  micrographs  images  obtained  at  backscattered  configuration  of  the  Mn:ZnO 
polycrystalline bulk (a) as prepared (AP) and (b) heat treated (HT) samples with the nominal concentrations of xN = 0.06,   0.11, 
0.17 and 0.22.  The  secondary phase is  well  observed  in  the panels  as dark gray  grains.  Highlighted areas  in panels  for  sample           
xN = 0.22 correspond to the area were the EDS mapping were conducted (supplementary file, Figures S4 and S5). 

Elemental analyses were performed via EDS measurements in multiple points and also over 

large surface areas of the samples. Representative EDS maps and point spectra measured at the 

Zn-rich (open cross in panel xN = 0.22 in Figure 3) and at Mn-rich (full cross in panel xN = 0.22 in 

Figure 3) grains are also presented in the supplementary file (Figures S4 and S5). The obtained 

average elemental percentages are listed in Table 1. We confirmed the Mn-doping of the w-ZnO 

lattice (Zn1−xMnxO in Table 1) for all samples. We observe that xE increases as xN increases and, 

as it was commented previously, xE is in good agreement with the xR factor obtained  from the 

Rietveld analyses. An important result of this analyses concerns the chemical composition of the 

MnO secondary phase in the HT samples. Zn is also presented in the MnO phase (supplementary 

Figure S5(f)), what lead us to nominate this secondary phase more properly as Mn1-xZnxO. As can 

be seen in Table 1, the Zn fraction into the MnO secondary phase matrix (xZn) is almost the same 

9 

 
  
 
 
the Zn fraction into the ZnMn2O4 secondary phase in the AP samples (also labeled as xZn in Table 

1). This finding leads us to conclude that the performed heat treatment in reducing atmosphere (Ar 

+ H2) is effective in removing oxygen atoms from the samples. The ZnMn2O4 phase is, therefore, 

induced to a structural change to Mn1−xZnxO due to the high amount of oxygen vacancies (VO) 

promoted under the heat treatment.  In the same sense, but in different strength, we can infer that, 

with  the  heat  treatment,  VO  were  also  promoted  in  the  Mn-doped  w-ZnO  (Zn1−xMnxO)  main 

fraction of the samples.

Table  2  presents  the  parameters  obtained  after  a  statistical  analysis  for  the  grain  diameter 

distribution.  The histogram for each sample is presented in the supplementary file (Figures S6 and 

S7). We observe that as xN increases the main diameter (d) of the grains decreases. It is well known 

that secondary phase particles can inhibit grain growth by pinning/dragging the migration of grain 

boundaries, which is often called as Zener effect [41]. Since it is observed a growing proportion 

of secondary phases (ZnMn2O4) in the AP samples with the increasing of the proportion of the 

MnO  precursor,  we  can  state  that  the  formed  ZnMn2O4  grains  act  as  pinning/dragging  center 

inhibiting the w-ZnO grain growth leading to a decrease of d as a function of xN. With this result 

we can return to the observed increasing of the Mn effective concentration (xE) into the w-ZnO 

matrix as function of xN. We can infer here that the incorporation of the Mn ions into the w-ZnO 

10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
takes  place  mainly  at  the  grain  surfaces.  Increasing  the  MnO  precursor  proportion  in  the 

preparation of the Mn:ZnO ceramics, increasing xN, increases the proportion of the ZnMn2O4 in 

the AP samples, leading to a decrease of the w-ZnO grain mean diameter (d), which, in turn, leads 

to an increase of the effective total surface area in the samples, allowing, therefore, a higher Mn 

incorporation.  It  is  import  to  stress  here  that  similar  results  were  also  reported  for  Co-doped 

nanograined w-ZnO samples [42].

3.3 Raman scattering spectroscopy: To complement the structural analysis, Raman scattering 

analysis were also performed in order to conduct a detailed structural analysis and an evaluation 

of the chemical composition of the samples. Figure 4(a) shows a representative spectrum for the 

AP and HT samples with xN = 0.22. The spectra for the other samples are quite similar to those 

shown in Figure 4(a). The Raman measurements were done here by using an objective of 10×, 

which leads to a relatively high analyzed average area. The presented spectrum corresponds also 

to  an  average  of  spectra  acquired  in  several  different  points  over  the  polished  surface  of  the 

samples. The series of narrow modes centered at 97, 383 and 435 cm−1 are assigned to the well-

known  E2L,  A1(TO)  and  E2H  w-ZnO  modes,  respectively  [43].  In  Figure  4(a)  the  spectra  are 

normalized by the integrated intensity of the main mode E2H. We also observe an extrinsic broad 

band  between  500  and  600  cm−1,  which  seems  to  be  formed  by  the  overlapping  of  several 

vibrational modes, with the most intense centered at 525 and 570 cm−1. The mode at 570 cm−1 can 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
be attributed to the overlap of the A1(LO) and E1(LO) modes [44] for the w-ZnO lattice. These 

modes  usually  present  low  intensities  in  undoped  w-ZnO  systems  due  to  the  destructive 

interference  between  the  deformation  and  the  Frölich  potentials  [45].  However,  the  vibrational 

mode at 525 cm−1 cannot be attributed to anyone of the w-ZnO structure. The emergence of this 

broad band is well report on the literature for undoped [46, 47] and doped w-ZnO with different 

elements  [48-53],  including  the  Mn  [14,  54].  This  band  is  clearly  addressed  to  the  structural 

disorder induced by the incorporation of dopants and defects into the w-ZnO lattice. Therefore, the 

observation of this extrinsic broad band for our samples is an indication that, at least, fraction of 

the Mn ions of the MnO precursor is incorporated into the w-ZnO lattice, corroborating the XRD, 

Rietveld and EDS analysis presented before. It is worth noting the higher relative intensity for HT 

samples.  Considering that both samples have the same proportions of Mn (Table 1), we can state 

that the HT samples have a higher density of defects, such as VO, than the AP samples, confirming 

the previous statement that the heat treatment in the reducing atmosphere (Ar + H2) is effective in 

introducing those kinds of defects also in the Mn-doped w-ZnO lattice. 

Figure  4(b)  and  Figure  4(c)  shows  representative  Raman  spectra  of  the  segregated  phases, 

ZnMn2O4 and Mn1−xZnxO for the samples with xN = 0.22, respectively. The spectra were acquired 

with an objective of 100×, which allows a high spatial resolution. The obtained spectrum for the 

ZnMn2O4 phase at the AP samples is in quite good agreement with that reported for single phase 

ZnMn2O4 samples [55, 56]. At the Γ point of the Brillouin zone (BZ) the group theory predicts ten 

allowed optical phonons for the ZnMn2O4 represented by Γ = 2A1g + 3B1g +B2g + 4Eg [55]. The 

high-frequency modes (586, 631 and 679 cm−1) are usually associated to the oxygen motion in the 

tetrahedral AO4 sites, and the low-frequency modes to the octahedral BO6 sites [57]. Nevertheless, 

further studies are necessary in order to corroborate this assumption. The Raman spectrum for the 

Mn1−xZnxO phase at the HT samples (Figure 4(c)) quite resembles the spectrum for the ZnMn2O4 

12 

 
phase (Figure 4(b)). As presented before, MnO has a cubic rock-salt structure, and, therefore, it 

should not exhibit any first-order Raman activity. The observation of the almost the same spectrum 

as for the ZnMn2O4 reveals that the structural change from ZnMn2O4 to the Mn1−xZnxO under the 

heat treatment for some ZnMn2O4 grains is not complete. It means that there is some amount of 

ZnMn2O4, not detected via XRD, into, or close to, the Mn1−xZnxO grains in the HT samples. In 

fact, we could observe in some relatively large secondary phase grains in the HT samples a not 

complete phase change. The inset of Figure 4(c) shows a representative SEM image of secondary 

phase grain with a core-shell structure formed by a ZnMn2O4 core and a Mn1−xZnxO shell.  To 

finalize, the main modes at around 322 and 679  cm−1 of the ZnMn2O4 are also detected in the 

spectra presented in Figure 4(a). It is important to remember that in the region of 330 cm-1 for the 

w-ZnO one can find also a relatively lower intensity w-ZnO vibrational mode 2E2L at the M-point 

of the BZ [58].

vibrational mode E2H. The spectrum for the AP sample is shown in solid lines and the symbols correspond to spectrum for the HT 
sample. Raman scattering spectra of the sample with xN = 0.22 (b) in the phase ZnMn2O4 (AP), and (c) in the phase Mn1−xZnxO 
(HT). The inset in (c) shows a representative SEM image of a relatively large core-shell grain formed by a ZnMn2O4 core and a 
Mn1−xZnxO shell. The phase identification was performed via elemental analysis (EDS).     

3.4 X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy: Figure 5 shows the XANES spectra obtained at room 

temperature for our Mn:ZnO bulk samples at the Mn absorption K-edge (6539 eV). It also presents 

13 

 
 
            
 
the spectra for different reference Mn-based materials with different Mn oxidation states, metallic 

Mn, MnO2 and the observed secondary phases ZnMn2O3 and MnO. A XANES spectrum gives 

information on the coordination symmetry and the valence of ions incorporated in a solid. The 

valence of the dopant ions can be analyzed by comparing their resulting edge structure to those 

obtained from reference samples. We observe for the samples AP and HT with xN = 0.06 (Figure 

5(a))  that  the  Mn  ions  assume  mainly  the  oxidation  state  +2.  The  line  shape  of  a  absorption 

spectrum  depends  on  the  unfilled  local  density  of  states  and  the  coordination  symmetry  of  the 

absorbing element [12, 59]. Here we observe that the line shape for samples with xN = 0.06  quite 

resembles  previously  reported  spectrum  for  Mn-doped  w-ZnO  [14],  indicating  that  the  main 

fraction of the Mn2+ ions occupy the Zn2+ sites into the w-ZnO lattice (substitutional doping). It is 

also important to call attention to the relatively higher white-line (maximum after absorption edge) 

for the HT sample.  This behavior is directly associated with an increase in the empty states left by 

open bonds due to vacancies defects promoted by heat treatment. This result corroborates the data 

obtained from Raman spectroscopy presented  above concerning the introduction of defects via 

heat treatment in the Mn-doped w-ZnO lattice. By increasing xN, it can be observed that the spectra 

for the AP samples approach the spectrum for the ZnMn2O4, not only in the edge, but also in the 

oscillations  above  the  edge.  In  the  same  way,  as  xN  increases,  the  spectra  for  the  HT  samples 

approach the spectrum presented for the reference MnO, as it was expected. Another relevant point 

concerns  the  observation  of  a  small  pre-edge  absorption  peak  for  all  the  samples  (indicated  at 

Figure 5(a)). This is only possible if Mn2+ ions are located in sites without an inversion center of 

symmetry, like the tetrahedral Zn2+ sites in the w-ZnO lattice [14, 51], instead of the octahedral 

sites in the ZnMn2O4 and MnO structures (structures in Figure 2). This result confirms the previous 

14 

 
assumption that fraction of the Mn ions is taken the place of the Zn2+ ions into the w-ZnO lattice 

even for the samples with xN > 0.06. 

Figure 5. Mn K-edge XANES spectra for as prepared (AP) and heat treated (HT) Mn:ZnO polycrystalline bulk samples for the 
nominal Mn concentrations of (a) xN = 0.06, (b) xN = 0.11, (c) xN = 0.17 and (d) xN = 0.22. Spectra of metallic Mn (Mn-M), rocksalt 
MnO (valence +2), ZnMn2O4 (valence +3) and MnO2 (valence +4) are also shown for comparison. E0 = 6539 eV. 

Figure  6  presents  the  extracted  k3-weighted  Fourier  transforms  (FT)  of  our  Mn:ZnO 

polycrystalline bulk samples, of the references powders ZnMn2O4 and MnO, as well as a spectrum 

obtained at Zn K-edge for an undoped ZnO reference sample prepared in the same condition as the 

AP samples.  Qualitatively we observe that the spectra for the samples AP and HT with xN = 0.06 

are quite similar. By comparison we also see that the spectra of these samples are quite different 

from those obtained for ZnMn2O4 and MnO, otherwise, they correspond quite well to the spectrum 

acquired for the undoped ZnO reference sample at Zn K-edge. This result can let us infer again 

that the main fraction of the Mn2+ ions in the AP and HT samples with xN = 0.06 are located in the 

sites of the Zn2+ ions in the w-ZnO lattice. For the samples with higher xN the case is different, 

exactly it was observed via XANES, for the AP samples, as xN increases, the obtained spectrum 

15 

 
 
 
 
for each sample resembles more and more the spectrum for the reference powder ZnMn2O4. On 

the  other  side,  for  the  HT  samples,  as  xN  increases,  the  spectra  became  similar  to  that  for  the 

reference powder MnO.  

Figure 6. k3 weighted Fourier transforms (FT) of Mn K-edge absorption data for the (a) as prepared (AP) and (b) heat treated (HT) 
polycrystalline Mn:ZnO samples and reference powders (ZnMn2O4 and MnO). The FT for the undoped ZnO sample were acquired 
ant Zn K-edge. The spectra are offset for clarity. Here the lines correspond to the experimental data and the symbols correspond to 
the theoretical simulation results.  

A theoretical simulation of the measured FT for the AP and HT samples with xN = 0.06 was 

also  performed  (Symbols  in  Figure  6).  The  technical  details  of  the  theoretical  analysis  were 

described in Ref. [14]. It was considered single and multi-scattering paths corresponding to the 

four successive atomic shells around Mn placed at the Zn sites of the ZnO structure according to 

the  hexagonal  wurtzite  with  P63mc  space  group.  The  parameters  obtained  via  simulations  are 

shown in Table 3. The obtained QF indicates the good reliability of the fits, which is confirmed 

by the comparison of the experimental  (lines)  and the fitted (symbols) data in Figure 6. These 

results also confirm that the Mn2+ ions in the AP and HT samples with xN = 0.06 are taking the 

place  of  the  Zn+2  ions  in  the  w-ZnO  lattice.  An  important  and  additional  information  can  be 

16 

 
 
 
extracted from the coordination number (N). For the first coordination shells N decreases relatively 

from sample AP to HT, which indicates an increase of the vacancy defects as a function of the heat 

treatment, confirming also the previous assumptions about the efficiency of the heat treatment to 

induce these defects into the w-ZnO lattice.

3.5  Magnetometry:  The  SQUID  measurements  were  performed  only  for  the  AP  and  HT 

samples with nominal concentrations of xN = 0.06 (free of secondary phases) and xN = 0.11 (with 

low  amount  of  secondary  phases  ZnMn2O4  (AP)  and  Mn1−xZnxO  (HT)).  All  M(H)  curves  (not 

shown) present a present a paramagnetic (PM) behavior with a positive slope, rather characteristic 

of  paramagnetic  behavior  (PM).  No  trace  of  ferromagnetic  order  is  detected  even  at  low 

temperatures. However, as we have undoubtedly shown in the previous sections, VO are induced 

in our samples via the heat treatment in the reducing atmosphere (Ar + H2), and, in spite of that, 

only a PM behavior is observed. What lead us to conclude that, at least for the Mn-doped w-ZnO 

system,  VO  are  not  the  necessary  defects  in  order  to  achieve  the  RTFM.  Following  the  results 

reported by Kittilstved et al. [60], Mn-doped w-ZnO presents RTFM only under p-type conduction, 

17 

 
 
 
therefore, since VZn is a shallow acceptor defect and can also form polarons, we can state that VZn 

is a better candidate to promote the ferromagnetic coupling among the Mn2+ ions.  

The inverse of the dc magnetic susceptibilities (χ−1) as a function of temperature are presented 

in Figure 7. In the high temperature range (100-300 K), χ−1 presents a typical linear Curie-Weiss 

(CW) behavior. Below 100 K, χ−1 deviates from  the linear dependence toward zero due to the 

effect of the ground states of  Mn clusters coupled by antiferromagnetic interactions [61]. This 

feature was also reported for different  TM-doped w-ZnO [62] and also for different DMS’s [63-

65]. In the Curie−Weiss law the dc magnetic susceptibility (χ) as a function of the temperature (T) 

is  given  as  χ(T)  =  C/(T−θ);  where  C  is  the  Curie  constant  per  gram  and  θ  is  the  Curie-Weiss 

temperature. The obtained parameters from the  fitting of the experimental data in  Figure 7 are 

presented  in  Table  4.  A  negative  θ  was  obtained,  which  is  a  confirmation  of  a  large 

antiferromagnetic (AF) interaction between Mn ions in the tested samples. We call attention to 

that only slightly differences can be observed between the AP and HT samples for both Mn nominal 

concentrations (Figure 7 and fit parameters in Table 4). This result indicates that the heat treatment 

does  not  affect  considerably  the  magnetic  properties  of  the  samples,  even  considering  the 

secondary phase transition from ZnMn2O4 (AP) to Mn1−xZnxO (HT) for sample with xN = 0.11. In 

fact, both secondary phases present AF behavior among the Mn ions in their structures. Bulk MnO 

was one of the first studied AF materials using neutron scattering, and its magnetic properties can 

be easily found in textbooks with θ = − 600 K, and Néel temperature of TN = 118 K [66]. Besides, 

the magnetic properties of the ZnM2O4 is not well completely understood, nevertheless, there is a 

consensus  that  it  is  also an  AF  material,  with  θ  =  −  333  K  ,  and  Néel  temperature  (still  under 

debate), ranging from 15 K [57] up to 297 K [67]. Here, we could not observe in the susceptibility 

measurements  for  the  sample  AP  with  xN  =  0.11  any  evidence  of  a  PM-AF  transition,  most 

18 

 
probably due to the low amount of the ZnMn2O4 secondary phases present in these samples (~3 

%, supplementary material, Table S1). However, based on the available magnetic data for these 

materials, we can interpret the increase of the strength of θ for the HT samples, as compared to the 

AP samples, to the presence of MnO in these samples, which has a higher AF coupling among its 

Mn ions than the ZnMn2O4.    

Figure  7.  Inverse  susceptibility  as  a  function  of  the  temperature  for  the  as  prepared  (AP)  and  heat  treated  (HT)  Mn:ZnO 
polycrystalline bulk samples with the Mn nominal concentration of xN = 0.06 and 0.11. The best fit of the high temperature data to 
Curie-Weiss law is shown as dashed lines. The diamagnetic background of the w-ZnO matrix (χD) was subtracted from the raw 
data. 

The Mn ion concentration (xM), for the single phase samples (xN = 0.06), was determined from 

the C value obtained through the Curie Weiss fit and the relation C = xMN(gµB)2S(S+1)/3kB, where 

N is the number of cation per gram, g and S  are the Landé factor and the spin of the Mn ions (g = 

2.0016, S = 5/2) [68], µB is the Bohr magneton and kB is the Boltzman constant. An estimation of 

the nearest neighbors exchange constant J1 can be made by using: θ0 = xM2zS(S+1)J1/3kB, where z 

is the coordination number of the nearest neighbors (z = 12). The obtained values for xM are in 

good agreement with the measured Mn concentration presented before (xE and xR). The J1/kB values 

the are also consistent with previous results on Zn1−xMnxO bulk samples [69-71].

4  CONCLUSIONS  

In summary, we have presented systematic microstructural and magnetic characterization of 

Mn:ZnO polycrystalline bulk samples prepared via standard solid-sate reaction  method. Structural 

results confirm the incorporation of the Mn2+ ions up to ~8.5 at.% (average value in Table 1) and 

indicate that it takes place mainly at the surface of the w-ZnO grains. For samples with higher Mn 

nominal content (xN) the secondary phases ZnMn2O4 and Mn1−xZnxO were detected for the AP and 

HT samples, respectively. It was directly confirmed that the heat treatment is efficient in reduce 

the metallic ions, Mn3+ to Mn2+, and in introduce VO into the system. For the sample of the lower 

xN, in spite of the Mn2+ doping of the w-ZnO lattice and the induced VO via heat treatment, the 

magnetometry results only show PM behavior with an AF coupling among the Mn2+ ions, without 

any trace of the often reported RTFM. Once considering the BMP model, we can state that VO can 

not be addressed to the defect responsible for the magnetic coupling between Mn2+ into the Mn-

doped w-ZnO lattice.
