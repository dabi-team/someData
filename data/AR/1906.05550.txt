The properties of sputtered and scattered ions are studied for ion beam sputtering of

Si by bombardment with noble gas ions. The energy distributions in dependence on

ion beam parameters (ion energy: 0.5 - 1 keV; ion species: Ne, Ar, Xe) and geometri-

cal parameters (ion incidence angle, polar emission angle, scattering angle) are mea-

sured by means of energy-selective mass spectrometry. The presence of anisotropic

eﬀects due to direct sputtering and scattering is discussed and correlated with pro-

cess parameters. The experimental results are compared to calculations based on a

simple elastic binary collision model and to simulations using the Monte-Carlo code

SDTrimSP. The inﬂuence of the contribution of implanted primary ions on energy

distributions of sputtered and scattered particles is studied in simulations.

It is

found that a 10% variation of the target composition leads to detectable but small

diﬀerences in the energy distributions of scattered ions. Comparison with previously

reported data for other ion/target conﬁgurations conﬁrms the presence of similar

trends and anisotropic eﬀects: the number of high-energy sputtered ions increases

with increasing energy of incident ions and decreasing scattering angle. The eﬀect

of the ion/target mass ratio is additionally investigated. Small diﬀerences are ob-

served with the change of the primary ion species: the closer the mass ratio to unity,

the higher the average energy of sputtered ions. The presence of peaks, assigned to

diﬀerent mechanisms of direct scattering, strongly depends on the ion/target mass

ratio.

INTRODUCTION

Ion beam sputter deposition (IBSD) is one of the well-known physical vapor deposition

(PVD) techniques. In comparison to other PVD techniques, such as magnetron sputtering

or evaporation, IBSD oﬀers the opportunity to tailor the properties of ﬁlm-forming parti-

cles, and, therefore, ﬁlm properties by varying the parameters of ion beam and sputtering

geometry over a wide range1.

In the IBSD system, the generation of energetic ions (ion

beam source), formation of secondary particle ﬂuxes (sputtered and scattered ones at the

target), and the ﬁlm growth area are locally separated. Change of ion beam parameters and

sputtering geometry results in diﬀerent angular and energy distributions of sputtered target

and scattered primary particles. The working pressure is typically less than 10−2 Pa, so the

mutual interaction within the secondary particle ﬂuxes is much weaker than in magnetron

sputtering or evaporation.

Although IBSD has been used for decades, its full capabilities have not been studied

systematically until recently. Typically, a beam of primary ions with energies up to 2

keV is used. Several groups performed angularly resolved measurements of energy/velocity

distributions of sputtered atoms2–12 in the mentioned energy range of primary ions. They

reported deviations from the well-known Thompson formula13,14, which were related to ion

energy, ion incidence angle and ion species9–11, or to the target topography12. At the same

time, the inﬂuence of scattered primary ions was usually neglected. In recent works, it was

shown that these ions can have high energy and a large impact on thin ﬁlm properties15,16.

Previously, systematic investigations of ion beam sputtering were made for Ag, Ge, and Ti

targets, bombarded by Ar, Xe or O2 ions. The trends and correlations between process

parameters, particle and ﬁlm properties for those IBSD conﬁgurations were discussed in a

recent tutorial17.

A quite appealing material for IBSD studies is Si, because of its importance in pho-

tovoltaics and microelectronics. Since systematic trends and diﬀerences in properties of

thin ﬁlms, produced with IBSD, were attributed to secondary particle properties17, the

measurements of their energy distributions are essential steps towards the deeper under-

standing of the process. There are some reports on the angular distributions18,19 and energy

distributions20 of Si sputtered by 1-3 keV Ar ions. However, the energy distributions of

sputtered Si ions were measured only up to 80 eV. The present study focuses on energy dis-

tributions of sputtered and scattered ions in a signiﬁcantly wider energy range, where needed

up to 1000 eV, measured during bombardment of a Si target with primary ions of Ne, Ar

and Xe. Measurements using energy-selective mass spectrometry are supplemented by sim-

ulations using the Monte-Carlo code SDTrimSP21 and calculations based on a simple elastic

binary collision model. The correlations between parameters and properties, similarities and

diﬀerences from other ion/target conﬁgurations are discussed.

II. EXPERIMENT

Figure 1 shows a schematic sketch of the ion beam sputter setup inside the vacuum

chamber. The setup consists of a broad-beam ion source, a target holder and an energy-

selective mass spectrometer (ESMS).

The ion beam source is based on a radio-frequency (RF) discharge with a three-grid

multi-aperture extraction system with an open diameter of 16 mm22. Process gases were

Ne, Ar, and Xe with a mass ﬂow rate of 20 sccm, 3.5 sccm and 1.3 sccm respectively. The

base pressure in the vacuum chamber was 1.5 × 10−4 Pa, and the typical process pressure

was about 5 × 10−3 Pa. The RF-power was set to 105 W for Ne, 70 W for Ar, and 35 W for

Xe, producing a total ion current of about 6 mA in all cases. The target was polycrystalline

Energy distributions of sputtered and scattered ions were measured using the energy-

selective mass spectrometer (ESMS) Hiden EQP. The diﬀerentially pumped ESMS was

operated in the energy range from 0 eV up to 1000 eV. The ESMS was mounted at the

chamber wall, and the oriﬁce diameter was 0.3 mm.

The target and the ion source are mounted on rotary tables with a common rotation axis.

The setup provided a possibility to vary the ion incidence angle α and the polar emission

angle β. The energy distributions of sputtered Si and scattered Ne, Ar and Xe singly charged

ions were measured at emission angles in steps of 20◦ for primary ion energies of 0.5 keV

and 1.0 keV, and incidence angles of 30◦ and 60◦. The yields of multiply charged ions are

orders of magnitude lower, and they were not considered.

III. MODELING AND CALCULATIONS

Energy distributions were also simulated using the Monte Carlo code SDTrimSP21. This

code is widely used for static and dynamic simulations of the sputtering process in various

materials. It is based on the binary collision approximation when each collision between

atoms is described as an elastic collision with an interaction potential. The energy transfer

to electrons is considered as a separate inelastic energy loss.

All simulations were performed with 108 primary ions to achieve suﬃcient statistics. Ion-

solid interactions were described using the Kr-C potential23, and the inelastic energy loss

model was equipartition of Lindhard-Scharﬀ24 and Oen-Robinson models25. The composition

of the target for static simulations was assumed to be 90% Si and 10% implanted particles.

These numbers are estimates of the average fraction of implanted primary ions in the near-

surface layers of the target. The estimates were obtained by dynamic SDTrimSP simulations.

The inﬂuence of scattering at implanted ions was previously observed for diﬀerent target

materials26–29. Please note that the code does not account for the formation of secondary

ions. We use the resulting simulated distributions as being comprised of the sum of neutral

atoms and ions. Later in the text, we will use the term particle to describe either a neutral

atom or an ion where we cannot distinguish between them.

The sputtering process in the energy range around 1 keV is commonly described by

redistribution of momentum and energy through linear collision cascades. At the same

time, target atoms can be sputtered after a single collision, which is designated as directly

sputtered. Similarly, the incoming ions can be directly scattered at particles of the surface or

near-surface region. Those events can be identiﬁed as features in experimental and simulated

energy distributions26–29.

Direct sputtering and scattering can be described in a simpliﬁed manner by the conserva-

tion of momentum and energy in a binary elastic collision. With the incoming primary ion of

mass Mion and initial energy Eion, and a target atom with mass Mtar at rest (Etar = 0), the

energy of sputtered target particle Espu and scattered primary particle Esca are calculated

as

where γ = 180◦ − α − β denotes the scattering angle. If Mion > Mtar, the scattering angles
are restricted by γmax = arcsin(Mtar/Mion) < 90◦. In case of Ar-Si interaction (Mion = 39.95
u, Mtar = 28.09 u), the limit is γmax ≈ 44.4◦. If Mion < Mtar, angles γ ≤ 180◦ are allowed
for scattered particles, and γ ≤ 90◦ for sputtered particles.

Eqs. 1 and 2 describe the ideal case. In reality, incident ions face additional energy losses.

First, there is the inelastic energy loss to electrons of the target, the so-called ”electronic

stopping”. It depends on the energy of incident ion and geometry. Assuming that direct

sputtering happens in the 2-3 topmost atomic layers of the target, calculations by SRIM30

yield values around 7 eV for Ne-Si, 11 eV for Ar-Si and 8 eV for Xe-Si interaction. Second,

sputtered and scattered particles have to overcome the surface potential, described by the

surface binding energy Esb. For Si Esb is determined to be 4.66 eV21, and for inert gas atoms

the surface binding energy is close to zero.

Table I contains calculated energies of direct sputtering and scattering events between

an incident primary ion and a Si target atom or an implanted primary ion using Eqs. (1)

and (2). Considering Ar-Ar, Ne-Ne and Xe-Xe interaction, Equations (2) and (1) become

identical. That means that sputtering and scattering events cannot be distinguished in the

experimental energy distribution in this case.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Energy distributions of sputtered Si ions

Figure 2 shows measured energy distributions of sputtered ions for the bombardment of

a Si target with Ar and Ne ions. All distributions have a low-energy peak followed by a

decay proportional to E−n up to 100 eV.

At higher energies, a high energy tail evolves. With decreasing scattering angle, the tail

becomes more prominent. The presence of the tail is explained by anisotropy eﬀects2–12. At

scattering angles γ = 60◦ and 40◦, broad structures at high energies can be seen (marked by

arrows). In previous studies with other target materials26–29, this structure was associated

with direct sputtering since the position of its maximum agreed well with the energy of a

direct event (Eq. (1)). The label near the arrow in Figure refers to the cited equation.

Figs. 2(a,c) and 2(b,d) show distributions for various incident ion energies. The overall

distribution shape stays almost the same if the same scattering angle is considered. Broad

features and the high-energy tail are linearly shifted to higher energies, the distribution is

”stretched” when incident ions have higher energy.

With the change of the process gas from Ar to Ne (Figs. 2(a,b) and 2(c,d)), the shapes

of the distributions change only slightly.

The distributions for various incidence angles in Figure 3 show that the shape of the

distributions changes with the scattering angle γ, and only slightly depends on speciﬁc

combinations of incident angle α and emission angle β.

B. Energy distributions of scattered ions

Figure 4 shows measured energy distributions of scattered Ar and Ne ions. The low-

energy maximum is followed by an abrupt signal drop. The high-energy tail also extends to

higher energies with decreasing scattering angles. At scattering angles γ = 60◦ and 40◦ a

broad structure with a local maximum appears. This structure (marked by arrows and the

number (2a)) is assigned to direct scattering at implanted ions because its energy agrees well

with the calculated energy according to the Table I. In the case of Ne scattering, a second

peak shows up at higher energies. This peak is related to direct Ne-Si scattering (Eq. (2)).

Direct Ar-Si scattering can only occur for γ < 44.4◦ due to the higher atomic mass of Ar, and

is indistinguishable from the noise. Implanted primary particles can be directly sputtered as

well, but the energy position will coincide with Ar-Ar/Ne-Ne scattering and can therefore

not be distinguished from these. Also, lighter Ne ions are scattered more eﬃciently than

heavier Ar ions, therefore showing a more prominent high-energy tail in all cases.

The dependency of energy distributions on incident ion energy (Figs. 4(a,c) and 4(b,d))

is similar to that for sputtered atoms. At higher incident ion energies, the direct scattering

features and high-energy tail are shifted to higher energies. The peak positions of the direct

event features are in good agreement with the simple calculation (Table I).

Distributions of scattered Ar ions are also almost independent of speciﬁc combinations

of incidence and emission angles when curves for the same scattering angle are compared

(Figure 5a). However, light Ne ions are directly scattered with higher energies at higher

incidence angles (which means lower emission angles) than the heavier Ar ions, as can be

seen from Figure 5b. This feature correlates with an increasing role of anisotropy eﬀects for

C. Simulated distributions of secondary particles

The simulated energy distributions in Figure 6 qualitatively reproduce the systematic

trends of the measured data, namely peaks of direct scattering and sputtering, and decreasing

steepness of the high-energy tail at smaller scattering angles. The positions of resolved peaks

agree well with experimental ﬁndings and calculations using the simple model (Eqs. 1, 2).

and 10% implanted primary ions, based on the estimates of dynamic simulations. It is in-

teresting to vary the percentage of implanted ions in order to study its eﬀect on the energy

distributions of sputtered and scattered particles. Figure 7 shows the case of Ne-Si bombard-

ment at a ﬁxed scattering angle γ = 60◦ for three target compositions: Si1.0, Si0.9Ne0.1 and

Si0.8Ne0.2. Sputtered particles show a slight dependence on the gas contribution. Scattered

primary particles show a small increase in numbers in the low-energy part of the distribution

with an increase of the gas contribution to the target. This increase is assigned to sputter-

ing of previously implanted particles. The high energy tail stays the same, preserving the

features of direct scattering.

D. Discussion

It is interesting to consider systematic correlations between the present data and the

results for Ag26,27, Ge28 and Ti29, sputtered by Ar and Xe ions.

In all experiments, the average energy of the sputtered ions increases with decreasing

scattering angle and increasing incident ion energy. The change of the primary ion species

aﬀects the distributions only slightly. The more important factor is the mass ratio between

primary ion and target atom. The closer the ratio to unity, the higher is the maximum

energy transferrable in a direct sputtering event (Eq. (1) with γ = 0◦).

In distributions of scattered ions, the broad peaks, assigned to direct scattering at im-

planted primary ions, were observed for all primary ion/target combinations. Positions of

their maxima are independent of the combination, since particles of the same mass inter-

act, but the peaks are higher for lighter atoms. In Ar-Ag, Ar-Ge and Ne-Si conﬁgurations,

energy distributions also have narrow peaks, assigned to direct scattering on target atoms.

In several cases, when the mass ratio is close to unity, the structures assigned to diﬀerent

scattering processes are mixed29.

Those trends are additionally veriﬁed by measurements for Si bombarded by Xe ions

SUMMARY

In the present work, the energy distributions of sputtered and scattered ions in the

ion beam sputtering process of Si were studied experimentally by energy-selective mass

spectrometry, and by simulations using the SDTrimSP code in dependence on ion beam

parameters and sputtering geometry.

The distributions of sputtered Si ions show similar dependencies as in previous IBSD con-

ﬁgurations with other target materials: the average energy of the sputtered ions increases

with increasing ion energy and decreasing scattering angle. Also, small diﬀerences are ob-

served with the change of the primary species: the closer the mass ratio to unity, the higher

the average energy of sputtered ions.

The distributions of scattered Ar ions show the importance of direct scattering on previ-

ously implanted primary ions and no signs of scattering at Si. This observation is supported

by the fact that the Ar/Si mass ratio is higher than unity, therefore direct scattering happens

only at oblique angles. At the same time, in case of the Ne-Si conﬁguration, the distributions

reveal the presence of both direct scattering channels. The average ion energy in both Ar

and Ne energy distributions also increases with ion energy and decreasing scattering angle.

Finally, lighter primary ions tend to scatter more eﬃciently and with higher average energy,

as can be seen from the comparison of energy distributions of Ne+, Ar+ and Xe+ ions.

A comparison of experimental data with simulated energy distributions shows qualitative

agreement and the same trends, and the presence of direct scattering and sputtering. Addi-

tional simulations show that a 10% variation of the contribution of the target composition

does not lead to signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the energy distributions of sputtered and scattered

particles.

The results presented in this paper complement systematic studies of IBSD with a very

important material. In principle, the discussed trends and eﬀects may also be applicable to

other materials. Due to great technological relevance, future measurements in the presence

of oxygen will complement the current and recent studies of SiO2 ﬁlms made with IBSD16.
