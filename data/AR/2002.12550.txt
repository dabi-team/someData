Abstract:  Spin  Hall  magnetoresistance 

(SMR) 

and  magnon 

excitation 

magnetoresistance (MMR) that all generate via the spin Hall effect and inverse spin 

Hall effect in a nonmagnetic material are always related to each other. However, the 

influence  of  magnon  excitation  for  SMR  is  often  overlooked  due  to  the  negligible 

MMR. Here, we investigate the SMR in Pt/Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) bilayers from 5 to 300K, 

in which the YIG are treated after Ar+-ion milling. The SMR in the treated device is 

smaller than in the non-treated. According to theoretical simulation, we attribute this 

phenomenon to the reduction of the interfacial spin-mixing conductance at the treated 

Pt/YIG interface induced by the magnon suppression. Our experimental results point 

out  that  the  SMR  and  the  MMR  are  inter-connected,  and  the  former  could  be 

modulated via magnon excitation. Our findings provide a new approach for separating 

and clarifying the underlying mechanisms.

Ferromagnetic  insulators  (FMIs)  has  emerged  as  a  promising  and  novel 

technology  platform  to  generate,  modulate  and  detect  spin  information  over  long 

distances  [1,2].  The  advantage  of  using  FMIs  against  metallic  ones  is  avoiding  the 

flow  of  charge  current,  preventing  ohmic  losses  and  the  emergence  of  undesired 

spurious effects [3]. Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) is one of the most prominent FMIs for 

the investigation of spintronics, magnonics [4,5], and spin caloritronics [6,7], due to 

its  extremely  low  damping,  soft  ferrimagnetism  and  negligible  in-plane  magnetic 

anisotropy  even  in  limit  thickness.  One  can  efficiently  investigate  and  control  the 

magnetization  direction  and  spin  waves  propagation  in  FMIs  through  transport 

measurements  based  on  the  spin  Hall  effect  (SHE)  and  the  inverse  spin  Hall  effect 

(ISHE) [2,8,9], by which the mutual conversion between magnon or spin current and 

charge current can be realized in a heavy metal (HM) with strong spin-orbit coupling 

(SOC).  Therefore,  the  combination  of  SHE  and  ISHE  can  give  rise  to  the  spin  Hall 

magnetoresistance (SMR) and magnon excitation magnetoresistance (MMR) [10,11], 

while the former can be ascribed to the spin transfer torque at the HM/FMIs interface. 

Owing to the SHE, the spin current would accumulate at the HM/FMIs interface with 

spin polarization σ parallel to the surface. If σ is not collinear with the magnetization 

M  of  the  FMIs,  the  accumulated  spin  current  can  exert  a  torque  proportional  to 

M×(M×σ) on the M of FMIs. It suggests that a finite spin current will be absorbed by 

FMIs if M and σ have a finite angle. The spin current absorption by FMIs represents 

the spin current reflection that is suppressed, and its resistance therefore will change 

with  the  magnetization  orientation  which  is  expected  to  be  maximized  (minimized) 

when M is perpendicular (parallel) to σ [8,9]. On the other hand, the MMR is firstly 

observed in Pt/YIG heterostructures in which the two parallel Pt strips were separated 

by a distance. When the two Pt electrodes are closed enough, the spin accumulation at 

2 

 
one Pt  strip  will transmit  into another strip  by magnon,  and the spin  current  will be 

converted into charge current via ISHE. Therefore, a large non-local charge current is 

supposed for M//σ, since the magnons beneath the first Pt strip can diffuse across the 

gap  to  the  second  Pt  strip.  In  contrast,  for  M⊥σ,  the  non-local  signals  should  be 

significantly reduced, since the spin transfer torque absorbs the magnon propagation. 

Therefore,  the  measured  resistance  or  voltage  signal  is  expected  to  be  maximized 

(minimized) when M is parallel (perpendicular) to σ [12]. The MMR can thus be seen 

as a magnon-mediated, non-local counterpart of the SMR. In short, both the SMR and 

the MMR stem from spin accumulation and spin transport at the HM/FIMs interfaces. 

Theoretically,  the  efficiency  and  strength  of  the  spin  transfer  across  the  interface 

depend  on  the  magnitude  of  interfacial  spin-mixing  conductance  (SMC)  G↑↓=(G 

r+iGi),  where  Gr  (Gi)  denotes  the  real  (imaginary)  part  [13,14].  Therefore,  if  the 

magnon transport can be suppressed or enhanced, it will change the magnitude of Gr 

and  the  SMR  is  expected  to  change  correspondingly.  However,  the  influence  of 

magnon excitation for SMR is often overlooked due to the negligible MMR, and few 

methods have been reported to separate and clarify the underlying mechanisms. 

In  this  work,  we  have  employed  the  etching  treatment  to  suppress  the  in-plane 

magnon transport and found that the SMR in Pt/YIG-based devices was dramatically 

altered  when  the  part  of  YIG  film  out  of  the  hall  devices  is  treated  with  Ar+-ion 

milling  etching.  At  room  temperature,  the  SMR  in  the  treated  device  was  much 

smaller  than  that  in  the  non-treated,  while  at  low  temperature  the  SMR  for  the  two 

devices  was  similar.  The  anomalous  SMR  reduction  has  similar  temperature 

dependence with magnon excitation. According to the theoretical simulation, we have 

attributed this phenomenon to the reduction of the G↑↓ at the Pt/YIG interface induced 

by  magnon  suppression  after  etching.  Our  experimental  results  pointed  out  that  the 

3 

 
SMR  and  the  MMR  were  interconnected,  while  the  former  can  be  modulated  via 

magnon excitation even  though the value  due to magnon excitations was much smaller 

than the SMR.   

The  epitaxial  YIG  film  was  grown  on  a  [111]-oriented  GGG  substrate  (lattice 

parameter  a  =  1.237  nm)  by  pulsed  laser  deposition  technique  with  the  substrate 

temperature  TS  =  780℃  and  the  oxygen  pressure  10  Pa.  Then  the  samples  were 

annealed at 780℃ for 30 min at the oxygen pressure of 200 Pa. The base pressure of 

the PLD cavity was better than 2×10-6 Pa. Then, the Pt layer was deposited on YIG at 

room  temperature  by  magnetron  sputtering.  In  order  to  avoid  the  run-to-run  error, 

each large Pt/YIG sample was then cut into two small pieces. After the deposition, the 

electron  beam  lithography  and  Ar  ion  milling  were  used  to  pattern  Hall  bars,  and  a 

lift-off process was used to form contact electrodes. The size of all the Hall bars is 20 

μm×120  μm.  For  comparison,  a  part  of  YIG  film  out  of  the  Hall  bars  was  etched 

away by Ar+-ion milling which was defined as YIG+ as shown in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 1 (b) 

shows the XRD ω-2θ scan spectra of the 40-nm-thick YIG thin film, which was taken 

from representative thin film of each type, and it shows predominant (444) diffraction 

peaks  with  no  diffraction  peaks  occurring  from 

impurity  phases  or  other 

crystallographic orientation, indicating the single phase nature. According to the (444) 

diffraction  peak  position  and  the  reciprocal  space  maps  of  the  (642)  reflection  of 

30-nm-thick YIG films grown on GGG as shown in Fig. 1(c), we have found that the 

lattice constant of YIG layer is similar with the value of GGG substrate, indicating the 

high  quality  epitaxial  growth  without  mismatch.  Moreover, 

the  saturated 

magnetization  of  the  YIG  layer  measured  by  a  vibrating  sample  magnetometer  was 

determined to be 140 emu/cm3 as shown in Fig. 1(d), which is similar with the value 

of the bulk YIG. All the magnetotransport measurements performed in the multilayers 

4 

 
were  carried  out  using  a  Keithley  6221  sourcemeter  and  a  Keithley  2182A 

nanovoltmeter. These measurements were performed at different temperatures from 5 

and 300 K in  a liquid-He cryostat that allows applying magnetic fields  H up to  3 T 

and rotating the samples by 360º. 

  Using  small  and  non-perturbative  current  densities  (~  106  A/cm2),  we  have 

investigated the angular-dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR) in Pt (5 nm)/YIG (40 

nm)  and  Pt  (5  nm)/YIG+  (40  nm)  devices  at  room  temperature.  The  measurement 

configuration, the definition of the axes, and the rotation angles (α, β, γ) are defined in 

the  sketches  as  shown  in  Fig.  2(a).  Figs.  2(b)  and  (c)  show  the  longitudinal  ADMR 

curves  with  applying  magnetic  field  of  3T,  and  the  ADMR  was  defined  as 

ADMR=[ρ−ρ(0  deg)]/ρ(0  deg)  [15].  The  ADMR  of  the  two  devices  show  the 

expected behavior of the SMR, in agreement with the earlier report in Pt/YIG bilayers, 

and the values in the treated and non-treated devices are about 5.723× 10−4 and 7.814× 

10−4, respectively. One can find that the SMR of Pt/YIG is 1.4 times larger than that in 

Pt/YIG+  device.  In  order  to  further  investigate  the  anomalous  SMR  reduction  in 

Pt/YIG+  device,  we  carried  out  the  ADMR  measurements  at  the  temperature  range 

from 5 to 300 K. The temperature dependent ADMR of Pt/YIG and Pt/YIG+ bilayers 

in  the β  scan with  3 T  field are shown  in  Figs.  3 (a) and (b), which  all  can be well 

fitted by the SMR mechanism. The Fig. 3(c) displays the temperature dependent SMR 

of  the  two  devices.  It  is  obvious  that  the  SMR  changes  non-monotonically  with 

decreasing temperature, which is in debate since it might stem from the competition 

of  two  physical  mechanisms:  the  spin  Hall  effect-induced  magnetoresistance 

(SHE-MR) and the magnetic proximity effect-induced magnetoresistance (MPE-MR) 

[16].  The  MPE-MR  becomes  evident  at  relatively  lower  temperature  due  to  the 

magnetization  induced  by  the  MPE,  while  at  higher  temperature,  the  thermal 

5 

 
fluctuations  will  dominate,  disrupting  the  spontaneous  Pt  magnetization  and 

eliminating the MPE-MR. More interestingly, the temperature dependence of SMR in 

Pt/YIG bilayers in the previous reports was weak, while the sharp drop of SMR below 

100  K  in  our  Pt/YIG  bilayers  would  be  discussed  latter  via  systematic  ADMR 

measurements  with  varying  the  thickness  of  Pt.  Furthermore,  we  have  defined  the 

ratio  ΔSMR  as  ΔSMR=[SMR(YIG)-SMR(YIG+)]/SMR(YIG),  and  the  temperature 

dependence is shown in Fig. 3(d). It seems to be constant below 100 K and linearly 

increases from 100K to 300K. The anomalous temperature dependence behavior may 

be  related  to  the  magnon  excitations,  which  should  also  be  suppressed  by  the  MPE 

and  increase  with  temperature.  To  further  verify  our  speculation  about  the  magnon 

excitation  modulated  SMR,  we  have  carried  out  the  Pt  thickness  (t)  dependent 

measurements. The unusual ΔSMR fluctuation curve with increasing t was shown in 

Fig.  4  (a).  We  can  find  that  the  ΔSMR  is  irrelevant  with  the  bulk  spin  Hall  angle 

(SHA) and spin diffusion length (SDL) of Pt that should exhibit a peak value at t ~ 3 

nm [17]. Therefore, the only possibility of the unusual ΔSMR should originate from 

the  change  of  the  interface  SMC  due  to  the  suppression  of  magnon  transport  after 

etching.   

To qualitatively analyze the experimental results, we employ a simulation within 

the  spin  drift-diffusion  theoretical  framework.  According  to  the  SMR  theory,  the 

longitudinal resistivities of the Pt layer are given by

, where 

m(mx,my,mz)=M/Ms  are  the  normalized  projections  of  the  magnetization  of  the  YIG 

film to the three main axes, Ms the saturated magnetization of the YIG, ρ0 is the Drude 

resistivity,  Δρ0  accounts  for  a  number  of  corrections  due  to  the  SHE  and  Δρ1  is  the 

main SMR term. The SMR is quantified by [10,18]:

Where λsd, θSH, t, and Gr are the spin Hall angle, the spin diffusion length, the Pt layer 

thickness,  and  the  real  part  of  the  SMC  at  the  YIG/Pt  interface,  respectively.  The 

thickness  dependence  of  the  longitudinal  resistance  is  shown  in  Fig.  4(b),  and  the 

product of the longitudinal resistivity ρ and the Pt film thickness t is found to change 

linearly  with  the  film  thickness  as  shown  in  the  inset  of  Fig.  4(b).  Considering  the 

product is found to well obey the equation ρt = ρbt + ρs with the bulk resistivity ρb and 

the interfacial resistivity ρs, which are determined to be 8.0 μΩ.cm and 32.0 μΩ.cm2 

based on the fitted lines, respectively. The bulk resistivity is close to the value of 10.0 

μΩ.cm of the bulk Pt [19]. Here, we have used the SHA, the SDL and the Gr as 0.07, 

1.5 nm  and 5×1015 Ω-1 m-1  [16,18,20]. We can find  a large discrepancy  between the 

fitted and the measured results as shown in Fig. 4(c). However, the variation trend of 

the SMR could be fitted with giving SHA = 0.131 and SDL = 0.864 nm as shown in 

Fig.  4(d),  and  the  large  SHA  should  stem  from  the  interfacial  contribution  [21]. 

Therefore, the sharp drop of SMR ratio below 100 K in our Pt/YIG bilayers could be 

derived from the large interfacial SHA.   

Notably,  the  Pt/YIG+  device  should  have  similar  SHA  and  SDL  with  Pt/YIG 

device.  We  can  fit  the  Gr  in  Pt/YIG+ bilayers  through  giving  SHA  0.131  and  SDL 

0.864 nm with Eq. (1). According to the fitted results as shown in Fig. 5(a), we can 

determine  the  Gr  at  the  Pt/YIG+  interface  is  one  order  of  magnitude  smaller  than 

Pt/YIG  interface.  Furthermore,  the  Hanle  magnetoresistance  (HMR)  cloud  modulate 

the  resistance  of  the  HM  layer  with  H  instead  of  M,  exhibiting  the  similar  angular 

dependent behavior with SMR: no resistance correction is observed for H parallel to σ, 

whereas a resistance increase is obtained for H perpendicular to σ [22,23]. Therefore,

the anomalous SMR reduction in our devices may also stem from the different HMR. 

Notably, the HMR is due to the spin precession around the external magnetic field H, 

leading to the spin relaxation, so we could distinguish SMR and HMR from the field 

dependent MR measurement. As shown in Fig. 5(b), we can find that the distinction 

of HMR is negligible as compared with SMR in Pt/YIG and Pt/YIG+ devices at H =3 

T. Recently, Y. Dai, et al. have found that the simulation method by Eq. (1) exhibits 

discrepancy  because  the  SHA  is  fluctuation  with  varying  the  thickness  of  Pt  layer. 

They  put  forward  the  electron  diffusion  coefficient  (EDC)  and  SDL  that  could  be 

precisely  estimated  through  the  ratio  of  HMR  and  SMR  [21].  Therefore,  we  would 

use  it  to  determine  the  EDC  and  SDL  in  the  Pt/YIG  devices.  Then,  the  SMC  at 

Pt/YIG+  interface  could  be  calculated  with  the  similar  EDC  and  SDL  in  Pt/YIG. 

Notably,  the  HMR/SMR  ratio  is  independent  of  the  SHA  and  thus  the  HMR/SMR 

ratio reads [21]: 

(2) 

where  g,  μB,  D,  and  B  are  the  Landé  factor,  the  Bohr  magneton,  the  EDC,  and  the 

magnetic induction intensity, respectively. The SDL and the EDC are determined to be 

2.02 nm and 4 × 10−6 m2s-1, respectively, where the longitudinal resistivity  ρ = 25.5 

μΩ.cm, Gr = 5 × 1015 Ω-1m-1, and the Landé factor g ≈ 2.0. As shown in Fig. 6, if one 

assigns the sd  and the  D  with  other values that deviate  from  2.02 nm and  4 × 10−6 

m2s-1, the fitted results cannot reproduce for all the samples. Based on the determined 

sd  and  D,  the  Gr  for  Pt/YIG+  device  is  five  times  smaller  than  Pt/YIG  device.

However, there is still a problem which needs to be further clarified. From Fig. 6 (c), 

we  can  find  that  the  fitted  curves  are  insensitivity  to  the  SMC  which  is  used  as  the 

only free parameter. It is difficult to point out which of the two fitted methods is more 

precise. Here, we put forward a simple model to further explain this result. According 

to the report by X. P. Zhang in Ref. [23], the Gr should be read as Gr = e2vF(1/τP-1/τT) 

= e2vF/τP + Gs, where e, vF, τP and τT are the elementary charge (e > 0), the density of 

states  per  spin  species  at  the  Fermi  level,  the  longitudinal  and  transverse  spin 

relaxation times per unit length for the itinerant electron, respectively. We note that Gr 

represents the difference between the longitudinal spin relaxation with transverse spin 

relaxation  and  it  does  not  have  a  physical  meaning  on  its  own.  The  Gs=-e2vF/τT 

originates entirely from spin-flip processes and associates with magnon emission and 

absorption  [24,25].  Therefore,  magnon  transport  could  affect  the  Gr.  In  the  Pt/YIG+ 

device,  the  part  of  YIG  film  around  the  Hall  bar  is  etched,  which  produces  infinite 

high barriers at two sides of the Hall bar and suppresses the in-plane magnon transport. 

Obviously, it will increase the magnon accumulation and suppress the spin absorption 

at  Pt/YIG+  interface,  which  will  reduce  the  Gr  and  the  corresponding  SMR  [26].  Q. 

Shao et  al.  also  found that  the measured SOT efficiency was significantly enhanced 

with  increasing  the  FMIs  (TmIG)  thickness,  which  is  completely  different  from  the 

FMs based devices. Similarly, we also found that the SMR is significantly enhanced 

with increasing the YIG thickness as shown in Fig. 6(d). Therefore, we also ascribe 

the modulated SMR to the magnon excitations because the thicker YIG is benefit for 

magnon diffusion, reducing magnon accumulation [27]. 

In conclusion, we have found the SMR in Pt/YIG-based devices was dramatically 

altered when the part of YIG film out of the hall devices was etched by the Ar+-ion 

milling. At room temperature, the SMR effect in the treated device was smaller than 

9 

 
in  the  non-treated  one.  According  to  theoretical  simulation,  we  attributed  this 

phenomenon  to  the  reduction  of  the  G↑↓  at  the  Pt/YIG  interface  induced  by  the 

suppressed magnon transport. Our experimental results pointed out that the SMR and 

the  MMR  that  were  inter-connected,  and  the  SMR  could  be  modulated  via  magnon 

excitation/suppression  even  though  the  magnitude  of  MMR  from magnon excitations 

was much smaller than the SMR. Our findings provide a new approach for modulating 

SMR for spintronic applications.
