Abstract
We present a 190 ks observation of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G306.3−0.9 with
Suzaku. To study ejecta properties of this possible Type Ia SNR, the absolute energy scale at
the Fe-K band was calibrated to a level of uncertainty less than 10 eV by a cross-calibration
with the Hitomi microcalorimeter using the Perseus cluster spectra. This enabled us for the ﬁrst
time to accurately determine the ionization state of the Fe Kα line of this SNR. The ionization
τ (cm−3 s) =10.24±0.03, signiﬁcantly
timescale (τ ) of the Fe ejecta was measured to be log10
smaller than previous measurements. Marginally detected Kα lines of Cr and Mn have consis-
tent ionization timescales with Fe. The global spectrum was well ﬁtted with shocked interstellar
matter (ISM) and at least two ejecta components with different ionization timescales for Fe
and intermediate mass elements (IME) such as S and Ar. One plausible interpretation of the
τ =11.17±0.07) is a
one-order-of-magnitude shorter timescale of Fe than that of IME (log10
chemically stratiﬁed structure of ejecta. By comparing the X-ray absorption column to the H I
distribution decomposed along the line of sight, we reﬁned the distance to be ∼20 kpc. The
large ISM-to-ejecta shocked mass ratio of ∼100 and dynamical timescale of ∼6 kyr place the
SNR in the late Sedov phase. These properties are consistent with a stratiﬁed ejecta structure
that has survived the mixing processes expected in an evolved supernova remnant.

1 Introduction

Type Ia supernovae (SNe) play a crucial role in the chemical
evolution of galaxies because they are the primary source of Fe-
peak elements. One of the clues for investigating the physics
of Type Ia SNe is X-ray spectra of supernova remnants (SNRs).
Because of a reasonably symmetric explosion in a uniform sur-
rounding medium, young Type Ia SNRs generally have sym-
metrical morphologies (Lopez et al. 2009), which enable us to
observationally investigate the stratiﬁed structure of heavy el-
ements directly reﬂecting the explosion mechanism. Hayato
et al. (2010) found signiﬁcantly slower expansion of Fe than
those of Si, S, and Ar in Tycho’s SNR based on the Doppler
measurements and interpreted it to be the evidence for seg-
regation of Fe ejecta to the inner region, which is naturally
expected from the Type Ia nucleosynthesis. Another exam-
ple is SN 1006, where Yamaguchi et al. (2008) detected low-
ionization Fe K-shell emission from the center of the remnant.
Element-dependent ionization timescales suggested that the ob-
served Fe has been heated by the reverse shock more recently
than the lighter elements. Kosenko et al. (2010) revealed the
layering of the elements in SNR 0519−69.0 with radial emissiv-
ity proﬁles using Chandra images. There are also some Type Ia
SNRs that appear not so nicely layered. 3C 397 (Yamaguchi
et al. 2015) and W 49B (Zhou & Vink 2018) are such exam-
ples, although their type identiﬁcations are still controversial.
As demonstrated by these previous studies, emission lines from
the shock-heated ejecta can be used as tracers of the distribution
of the nuclear-burning products. The Fe K-shell emission is of
particular importance among the available thermal X-ray lines,
as it traces a product at the end point of the Ia nucleosynthesis,
and thus has the most contrasted distribution compared to those
of intermediate-mass elements (IME: Si, S, Ar, and Ca).

The stratiﬁed structure may be modiﬁed by hydrodynami-
cal instabilities as an SNR evolves (Chevalier et al. 1992, Wang
& Chevalier 2001). This is particularly the case if the circum-
stellar environment largely deviates from the uniform and ho-
mogeneous distribution. One example is a bubble made by
accretion wind from a companion star. Badenes et al. (2007)
showed that the interaction between ejecta and a dense ra-
diative bubble formed by low-speed accretion wind (model
HP3u1e6) enhances ionization of both Si and Fe compared to
the uniform ISM case, and eventually equalizes the average
ionization timescales of these elements at a few kyr. Garc´ıa-
Senz et al. (2012) demonstrated another possibility with three-
dimensional simulations that a hole in ejecta carved by a com-
panion star affects the long-term evolution of an SNR. In this

model, large-scale hydrodynamical instabilities at the edge of
the hole trigger the intrusion of material into the hole during
the Sedov phase. Such an effect may cause an efﬁcient mixing
of ejecta. Aside from the SNR evolutions, theoretical studies
of the single-degenerate scenario even suggest the possibility
that ejecta may be completely mixed at the time of explosion by
multiple igniting bubbles (Garc´ıa-Senz & Bravo 2005, Badenes
et al. 2005). However, there has been only a limited number of
samples to observationally investigate these possibilities. Only
14 samples have been identiﬁed as Type Ia SNRs or candi-
dates with clear detection of the Fe Kα emission (Yamaguchi
et al. 2014a, Maggi & Acero 2017), and eight among them
have been examined for elemental dependence of ionization
timescales with the latest generation of X-ray CCD spectrom-
eters. Most of them, including G344.7−0.1 (Yamaguchi et al.
2012), SN 1006 (Uchida et al. 2013), Kepler’s SNR, Tycho’s
SNR, and SNR 0509−6.5 (Katsuda et al. 2015), have relatively
low ionization timescales (log10 τ <11 for IME and log10 τ <10
for Fe), suggesting the samples are biased toward young Ia
SNRs. Therefore it is still unknown when and how the stratiﬁed
structure of a Type Ia SNR is distorted by mixing, in particular
owing to external inﬂuences.

The SNR G306.3−0.9 was discovered with the Swift
Galactic plane survey (Miller et al. 2011). Reynolds et al.
(2013) conducted a 5 ks follow-up observation with Chandra
and revealed the distorted morphology with brightening toward
the southwest. The X-ray spectrum showed emission lines from
highly ionized atoms of Mg, Si, S, and Ar. The spectrum was
described by a non-equilibrium ionization plasma with a tem-
perature below 1 keV. The small extension of ∼4 pc radius as-
suming a distance of 8 kpc and the Sedov model makes the rem-
nant a young Galactic SNR with an age of about 2.5 kyr.

Combi et al. (2016) (hereafter CO16) reported the results of
longer-exposure observations with XMM-Newton and Chandra.
With ∼50 ks observation for each, they performed spatially re-
solved X-ray spectroscopy and discovered Kα emission lines of
Ca and Fe from the central and southwestern parts. To explain
the existence of these lines, they revised a view of the X-ray
spectra from a single-temperature plasma to two-temperature
plasma consisting of ISM and single ejecta components with
temperatures of ∼0.2 and 1–2 keV, respectively. The Fe Kα
line had a centroid of 6.52±0.01 keV. They concluded that
G306.3−0.9 is a remnant of a Type Ia SN based on both the
relatively low-density environment suggested by the Fe Kα line
(Yamaguchi et al. 2014a) and the relatively low ellipticity of the
X-ray morphology derived from the multipole-moment image

analysis (Lopez et al. 2011). The ionization timescales were
measured at log10 τ =10.5–11.0. Thus, the SNR is a good can-
didate to study the ejecta distribution in a relatively later phase
in thermal evolution. Recently, Sezer et al. (2017) (hereafter
SE17) reported results of an X-ray observation with Suzaku
(Mitsuda et al. 2007) of G306.3−0.9. The X-ray spectra were
reproduced with a similar model to CO16 consisting of the ISM
and ejecta components, while the temperatures were signiﬁ-
cantly different (≈0.6 keV for ISM and ≈3 keV for ejecta).
The Fe Kα centroid was measured at a slightly lower value,
6.50±0.01 keV. In these studies, the ejecta emission from Si
to Fe was reproduced by a single-component plasma, implying
the common ionization timescales for the range of elements. A
natural interpretation to this is that the stratiﬁcation has been
signiﬁcantly reduced by mixing, which is clearly different from
what we observe in other Ia remnants. Because the characteri-
zation of the stratiﬁed ejecta largely relies on the measurement
of ionization timescale of Fe, the accuracy of the Fe Kα cen-
troid should be a key factor. The recent two studies reported
Fe Kα centroids that disagree at the 1.0σ level but agree at the
2.0σ level. This raises the possibility that a revised data analy-
sis with the latest, most accurate calibration might resolve this
apparent discrepancy.

In this paper, we present a re-analysis result of the X-
ray spectrum of the entire remnant with the X-ray Imaging
Spectrometer (XIS: Koyama et al. 2007) onboard Suzaku. The
deepest exposure of about 190 ks together with cross-calibrated
energy scale around 7 keV with the X-ray micro-calorimeter
(SXS: Mitsuda et al. 2014) onboard Hitomi (Takahashi et al.
2016) allows us to study the nature of the Fe ejecta accurately.
We discover that the Fe ejecta has signiﬁcantly smaller ioniza-
tion timescale than IME, which recovers a consistent view of
the chemically stratiﬁed ejecta structure of a Type Ia SNR.

2 Observation and Data Reduction

G306.3−0.9 was observed with the XIS on 2014 August 20–
25 (sequence number: 509072010) with an aim point of (R.A.,
Decl.)J2000.0 = (13h21m54.s072, −63◦33′36.′′72). The entire
remnant was covered by a 17.′8×17.′8 ﬁeld of view (FOV) of
the XIS.

The XIS consists of four X-ray CCD cameras, placed at the
focal planes of the X-Ray Telescope (XRT: Serlemitsos et al.
2007). Three (XIS 0, 2, 3) are front-illuminated (FI) sensors,
while the other (XIS 1) is a back-illuminated (BI) one. The en-
tire area of XIS 2 and a quarter edge of XIS 0 have not been
functional since 2006 November and 2009 June, respectively.
The angular resolutions of XRTs are 1′.9–2′.3 in the half-power
diameter (HPD) with almost no dependence on X-ray energies
and off-axis angles within ∼ 10%. The total effective area of
the operational three sensors is 480 cm2 at 8 keV. The low-Earth

orbit at an altitude of ≈550 km enables the low and stable back-
ground environment.

The XIS was operated with the full-window and normal-
clocking mode. The spaced-row charge injection was applied to
mitigate the degradations in the energy gain and resolution. The
data reduction was done with the software package HEASoft
version 6.22 and the pipeline processing version 3.0. With this
processing, the latest and ﬁnal Suzaku calibration database re-
leased on 2016 April 01 was applied to register energies of
X-ray events using the method described by Uchiyama et al.
(2009) and Sawada et al. (2012). We removed events during the
South Atlantic Anomaly passages, the Earth elevation angles
below 5◦, the Earth daytime elevation angles below 20◦. The
exposure after the reduction is 190 ks. We eliminated events of
ﬂickering pixels with noisy pixel maps1. We further removed
their adjacent neighbors as these also contributed to degrading
spectral performance for the present data. These maskings re-
duced the event numbers to 85%, 45%, and 89% for XIS 0, 1,
and 3, respectively. The higher rejection rate for XIS 1 is partly
attributable to the intrinsically higher fraction of noisy pixels
than other sensors, which is essentially because of the different
manufacturing processes (i.e., BI vs. FI).

Response ﬁles were generated by xisrmfgen and xissimarf-
gen (Ishisaki et al. 2007) and Non–X-ray Background (NXB)
events were retrieved by xisnxbgen (Tawa et al. 2008) with the
same version of the calibration database.
In the calculation
of the effective area, an extended source with uniform X-ray
brightness was assumed. Losses of effective area due to the
removal of the noisy pixels and the neighbors were taken into
account by the method provided by the XIS team1.

3 Analysis and Results

3.1 Images

Figure 1 shows band-limited XIS images of G306.3−0.9.
Thanks to the low NXB level of the XIS, we obtained the hard-
band image above 5 keV for the ﬁrst time. The spatial distri-
bution was found to be nearly identical between the hard band
(b) and the Fe Kα band (c), indicating the thermal origin of the
continuum emission above 5 keV.

The angular size of the remnant, 110′′ in radius, is com-
parable to the HPD of the XRT (1.′9–2.′3: Serlemitsos et al.
2007). This makes it difﬁcult to analyze spatially resolved spec-
tra. Actually, SE17 found no signiﬁcant difference in spectral
shapes (absorption columns and electron temperatures) when
spectra from inner and rim regions were compared. Thus, we
decided to analyze the emission from the entire remnant, and
determined the source and background regions for the spec-
tral analysis as indicated with solid and dashed ellipses, respec-
tively, in ﬁgure 1.

lower ionization ions, the dashed bars for n =1–3 lines from He-like ions

3.2 Spectral analysis

For spectral analysis, we used Xspec version 12.9.1p with
AtomDB version 3.0.9 unless otherwise noted. Charge-state
distributions were calculated based on ionization and recom-
bination coefﬁcients compiled by Bryans et al. (2009) for emis-
sion models.
Photo-electric cross sections by Balucinska-
Church & McCammon (1992) were used for absorption mod-
els. The solar abundances of Anders & Grevesse (1989) were
used for the both types of models. Uncertainties are quoted at
90% conﬁdence intervals while error bars in ﬁgures show 1-σ
intervals unless otherwise noted.

Figure 2 shows the FI spectra extracted from the source and
background regions after energy-scale correction as described
below. The excess emission above the background is signiﬁcant

up to ≈9 keV. The detections of the K-shell lines of Ca and Fe
recently reported by CO16 were conﬁrmed with the XIS spectra
with rich statistics.

In the model ﬁtting analysis, energy bins near the Si-K edge
were ignored because of the limited calibration accuracy of the
edge structure2. Different energy ranges were deﬁned and elim-
inated for FIs (1.70–1.90 keV) and BI (1.75–1.85 keV) to mit-
igate a normalization inconsistency at Si Heα originating from
the same issue. For the BI data, bins above 7 keV were also ig-
nored because of large systematic uncertainty in an X-ray ﬂux
due to the higher NXB rate.

3.2.1 Cross-calibration of energy scale using Hitomi SXS
Accurate energy-scale in 6–7 keV is required to determine the
ionization timescale of Fe ejecta using the Fe Kα energy cen-
troid based on CCD spectra. The inner two segments (B and C:
Koyama et al. 2007; the Suzaku technical description3) of the
XIS at this energy band have been calibrated with Fe Heα from
the Perseus cluster. A 20 ks observation of the calibration tar-
get was conducted one week after G306.3−0.9 (sequence num-
ber: 109005010). An unprecedented high-resolution observa-
tion of this cluster was recently carried out with the SXS on-
board Hitomi (e.g., Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2016, Hitomi
Collaboration et al. 2017). The energy resolution of ≈5 eV at
FWHM and the absolute energy accuracy of ≈1 eV at the Fe-K
band (Leutenegger et al. 2016) make this observation the best
reference ever. Therefore, we examined the XIS energy scale in
this band against the SXS spectrum.

Using the closest XIS observation of the Perseus clus-
ter, being conducted and processed in the same manner as
that of G306.3−0.9, we extracted the FI spectrum from the
SXS FOV. The SXS spectrum of the Fe Heα is characterized

by a ≈4 keV CIE plasma with a redshift of 0.01756 (e.g.,
Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2016), but is better reproduced by a
three-temperature CIE model (an “improved model” by Hitomi
Collaboration et al. 2018a), thus we applied the latter model as
the reference spectrum. As this model was based on SPEX ver-
sion 3.03, we imported it to Xspec by using flx2tab and com-
pared to the XIS spectrum in 6.38–6.68 keV. An energy shift
was then added as a free parameter, which was measured to be
+4.2±6.6 eV. This result shows that the FI energy scale at the
Fe-K band is highly reliable at a level of <
∼10 eV near the obser-
vation period of G306.3−0.9. The BI energy scale in this band,
on the other hand, showed a few 10 eV deviation from both the
FI and SXS energies, and was corrected to match the SXS. We
further checked possible energy shifts in the lower energy bands
below 4 keV using theoretical values of the Heα and Lyα lines
of Si, S, Ar, and Ca, but found no signiﬁcant shifts (i.e., shifts
larger than ≈10 eV), either in the FI or BI spectrum.

3.2.2 Single ejecta models

We performed spectral ﬁttings with models of optically thin
thermal plasma attenuated by interstellar absorption. Chemical
abundances (Z) of heavy elements with line detections (Ne,
Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe), as well as electron temperatures
(kTe), ionization timescales (τ ), emission measures (EM ), and
hydrogen-equivalent absorption column density (NH) were al-
lowed to be free in the ﬁttings. To start with, we tried single-
temperature plasma models either at collisional ionization equi-
librium (CIE) or non-equilibrium ionization (NEI), but obtained
poor ﬁts (χ2/dof ≈ 4) with large positive residuals above ≈
4 keV, which is consistent with the result studies by CO16 and
SE17.

Next, we tried two-temperature models. Even for the best
ﬁts, line-like residuals at ≈1.23 keV were always found. This is
likely due to known ﬂux deﬁcits of Fe-L lines from highly ex-
cited ions (n≥5: Brickhouse et al. 2000), and thus we thereafter
added a Gaussian at a ﬁxed energy of 1.23 keV. This is a crude
approximation because actual Fe-L lines are ensembles of many
different transitions, but it turned out to be sufﬁcient for the
present data given the energy resolution and statistics. Similar
treatments are found in the analysis of other SNRs (e.g., Sawada
& Koyama 2012, Sato et al. 2016, and Karpova et al. 2016). We
found that combinations of a low-temperature CIE with the so-
lar abundance and a high-temperature NEI with variable abun-
dance gave relatively good ﬁts. The CIE and NEI components
can be attributed to shocked ISM and ejecta, respectively. We
made several trial ﬁts with different initial values of the ﬁtting
parameters and found that there were two local minima. One
has relatively low temperatures of 0.2 keV for ISM and 1.6 keV
for ejecta, while the other has higher values of 0.6 keV and
2.8 keV. The two sets of the ﬁtted parameter values are sim-
ilar to those reported by CO16 and SE17, respectively. Both

the models explain ejecta emission as a single NEI component,
and thus we refer to these as the single-ejecta models (a) and
(b). The best-ﬁt parameters are listed in the columns (a) and (b)
of table 1. Although the previous studies reported that a single-
ejecta model was enough to reproduce the full-band spectrum of
G306.3−0.9, notable “N”-shaped residuals are seen around the
Fe Kα line (ﬁgure 3a and b). It should also be pointed out that,
even with the different calibration databases (section 3.2.3), the
“N”-shaped residuals were seen in the previous Suzaku ﬁtting
results (see ﬁgure 2 in SE17). These facts obviously show that
the applied single-ejecta models predict higher centroids than
the XIS data.

3.2.3 Band-limited ﬁttings

The failures in reproducing the Fe Kα centroid with the single
ejecta models indicate the difference of ionization timescales
between IME and Fe. Because the ionization timescale of
Fe ejecta is obtained from the Fe Kα centroid, we per-
formed a band-limited ﬁtting above 5 keV and derived the cen-
troid value. An empirical model consisting of Gaussians and
bremsstrahlung was applied. Figure 4 shows a close-up view
of the 5.0–10.5 keV band with the best-ﬁt model. The cen-
troid and width of the Gaussian for Fe Kα were derived to be
6477.2+7.5
−14.1 eV, respectively. There are also
hints of other emission lines particularly in the FI data. The line
centroids were measured at 5.51±0.08, ≈5.94, 7.15+0.24
−0.14 keV,
which indicate that these are likely the Cr Kα, Mn Kα, and
Fe Kβ lines, respectively. The signiﬁcances are 2.3, 1.1, and
1.7σ, respectively, requiring a future conﬁrmation. The relative
intensities to the Fe Kα line are 5.7±4.0%, 2.6 (<6.6)%, and
4.4±4.2%, respectively. The bremsstrahlung temperature was
measured to be 4.1+4.3

−9.5 eV and 57.8+12.1

−1.6 keV.

The measured centroid of Fe Kα is signiﬁcantly lower
than the previous results (6.52±0.01 keV by CO16 and
6.50±0.01 keV by SE17), and this is the reason why the present
spectra cannot be reproduced by the single-ejecta models. We
note that a part of the discrepancy between the two Suzaku re-
sults is likely due to a difference in the energy scale calibration;
we used the latest and ﬁnal calibration database to calculate the
energy scale, which was further tested against and matched to
the SXS. We then derived Fe Kα centroids for various sets of the
NEI parameters (kTe and τ ) from calculated spectra, as shown
with the colored ﬁlled contours in ﬁgure 5. Using this, we
mapped the measured Fe Kα centroid into the NEI parameter
space (dashed light blue contours in ﬁgure 5).

Separately, we can constrain possible combinations of the
NEI parameters for IME by ﬁtting the soft-band spectra in the
1.85–4.3 keV band. In this analysis, we started from the best-ﬁt
parameters with the full-band ﬁttings (section 3.2.2). We then
ﬁxed parameters which do not have major spectral features in
1.85–4.3 keV. These are NH, kTe and EM of the ISM com-

ponent (apec), FX of the Gaussian, and Z for Ne, Mg, Fe and
Ni of the ejecta component (vvnei). Leaving other parameters
free, we derived a two-dimensional conﬁdence limit on kTe and
τ of the ejecta using the steppar command in Xspec. As we
obtained two local minima in the full-band ﬁtting with single-
ejecta models (a and b), we repeated the same analysis for each
of them. The results, which we refer to as a′ and b′, are shown
in ﬁgure 5 with two sets of white contours.

The two conﬁdence limits (a′ and b′) show no overlap in
the parameter space within 5σ, but the inferred Fe Kα centroids
are similar to each other (≈6.53–6.55 keV) and are signiﬁcantly
higher than that actually measured at Fe Kα (≈6.48 keV). This
discrepancy already implies different ionization timescales be-
tween Fe and IME. The only case in which Fe and IME have
the consistent ionization timescales is that kTe of Fe is 1 keV
or lower. This possibility can safely be ruled out by the lower
limit of 2.5 keV obtained in the hard-band ﬁtting. This sets the
upper-limit on the ionization timescale of the Fe ejecta to be
log10 τ ≈10.3, suggesting lower τ value of the Fe ejecta than
IME. Below, we further examine this with the full-band analy-
sis.

3.2.4 Multi-τ ejecta models
To better describe the low ionization nature of the Fe Kα line
in the full-band analysis, we introduced the second NEI com-
ponent. In trial ﬁttings, the electron temperature was inferred
to be high, i.e. >3 keV. The temperature was as high as a few
10 keV. We found that the improvement of ﬁts were small and
only found at the Fe-L lines. Because the line centroid of Fe Kα
does not change above ≈5 keV (ﬁgure 5) and also the Fe-L
structure has relatively large systematic uncertainty in emission
models, we ﬁxed the electron temperature of the second NEI
at 5 keV. Between the two ejecta components, the ionization
timescale τ , abundance Z for Fe, and emission measure EM

Fig. 5. Constraints on the NEI parameters (kTe and τ ) with the band-limited
ﬁttings. The two sets of white contours (a′ and b′) show the results of the
IME-dominant band in 1.85–4.3 keV based on the two single-ejecta models
(a and b) as initial and ﬁxed parameters. The levels are at the 90%, 3σ, and
5σ intervals. The light blue dashed curves show the constraint by the Fe Kα
centroid at the 90% interval. The colored ﬁlled contours show the expected

were allowed to be different. Because the measured energy
centroid ratios between the Cr Kα, Mn Kα, and Fe Kα lines
are all consistent with being a single component (i.e., can be
described by the same kTe and τ ), Cr and Mn are likely associ-
ated with the Fe-dominated ejecta. Thus, the abundances of Cr
and Mn were set free for the Fe-dominant ejecta while those for
the IME-dominated ejecta were ﬁxed to the solar values. The
Ni abundance was assumed to be the same as Fe in relative val-
ues to the solar abundances because of no clear detection of the
Ni Kα line. The abundances of the other elements were all tied
to each other between the two ejecta components. This model
(“c”) signiﬁcantly improved the ﬁt (χ2/dof =1.17) as shown in
ﬁgure 3c. The best-ﬁt parameters are given in the column (c) of
table 1. As already indicated by the band-limited spectral anal-
ysis, the ionization timescale τ of the Fe-dominated component
(Ejecta 2 in table 1) is about one-order-of-magnitude smaller
than the IME-dominated one (Ejecta 1).

There are still small residuals in the Fe-K band with the two-
ejecta model (ﬁgure 3c), particularly for the FI data. One is
an asymmetric “M”-shaped feature found around Fe Kα with
larger excess at the lower-energy side. This indicates that the
current model underestimates the width. Actually, the line re-
quired a larger width (≈ 60 eV: section 3.2.3) than that expected
from the current model (≈ 45 eV). The excess broadening of
≈40 eV corresponds to a Doppler speed of σv ≈2000 km s−1
if bulk motions superposed on the line of sight are the cause.
On the other hand, the Heα lines of IME required no signiﬁ-
cant broadening (σ < 5 eV at the 90% upper limit). Because
the equivalent-width maps by CO16 showed no clear indica-
tion of Fe ejecta localized outside IME, it is very unlikely that

the Fe ejecta has a much larger bulk speed than the preceding
IME ejecta, making the Doppler broadening origin unfeasible.
Another possibility is thermal broadening. The 40 eV excess
broadening converts to kTFe ≈2 MeV, which is ≈400 times
higher than kTe.

An alternative idea to explain the broadening is that the Fe
ejecta consist of multiple components with different ionization
timescales. This idea is supported by the possible Fe Kβ line
at 7.15 keV. The feature is not well reproduced by the current
model. This is partly because the mismatch of the line cen-
troid; Fe atoms in Ejecta 2 are dominated by F- and O-like ions,
whose Fe Kβ line energies are expected around 7.35 keV. The
insufﬁcient line emissivity can also be attributed to the charge-
state distribution in the current model. As ionization stage gets
as high as O-like, Fe ions lose all n =3 electrons, which re-
sults in zero ﬂuorescence yield for the Kβ transition. Such a
Fe-K structure is reminiscent of Tycho’s remnant (Yamaguchi
et al. 2014b). The Fe-K spectrum of Tycho’s SNR is explained
by a combination of two components with different ionization
timescales. Therefore, we further examined models with multi-
ple τ for the Fe-dominated ejecta.

First we replaced Ejecta 2 with a plane-parallel shock plasma
by using vvpshock in Xspec, which assumes a continuous
τ distribution with a constant differential emission measure
against τ . This model (“d”) mitigated the residuals at the Fe Kα
and Kβ lines with χ2/dof =1.13 (ﬁgure 3d). We then tried
another model that assumes two discrete τ values for the Fe-
dominated ejecta by using two vvnei components (Ejecta 2
for higher τ and Ejecta 3 for lower τ ). All the parameters of
Ejecta 3 were ﬁxed to those of Ejecta 2 except for the emission
measure (EM ) and the ionization timescale (τ ). As shown in
ﬁgure 3e, this model (“e”) better explained the Fe Kβ feature
than the previous one, although the improvement for the entire
spectrum is marginal (≈1σ by F-test). The improvement from
(c), on the other hand, is signiﬁcant at ≈5σ. The best-ﬁt pa-
rameters for the models are given in the columns (d) and (e) of
table 1, respectively.

Even with the model (d) or (e), we still see some line-like
residuals. These are found at ≈1.55 keV and ≈2.60 keV. The
former is near Al Heα (1.598 keV for 1s–2p 1P1 and 1.575 keV
for 1s–2s 1S0), but is slightly lower. The abundance of Al, when
being set as a free parameter, was derived to be 1.62+0.35
−0.29 solar.
The super-solar abundance of Al is expected in ejecta of Type Ia
remnant, but both the line detection and measured abundance
value of Al may require a future conﬁrmation because of the
discrepancy in the line energy. The latter feature at ≈2.60 keV
indicates underestimation of S Lyα/Heα line ratio or the aver-
age charge of S ions, but we cannot conclude whether this is
real or not because it is only visible in the FI spectrum.

4 Discussion

4.1 Nature of Fe ejecta and chemical stratiﬁcation

As established in the spectral analysis, the Fe-dominated ejecta
(Ejecta 2 in table 1) has one-order-of-magnitude lower ioniza-
tion timescale than the IME-dominated ejecta (Ejecta 1). This
is the evidence for the lag in the shock-heating ages between Fe
and IME, which overturns the previous results of spectral anal-
yses by CO16 and SE17. A plausible interpretation of the lag is
a chemically stratiﬁed structure of the ejecta. The present data
do not allow us to directly investigate a layered structure using
X-ray images. CO16 argued that the Fe K emission is centrally
concentrated compared to IME. This would support our argu-
ment, but no quantitative or statistical examination was made.
A future study with a better spatial resolution and a large effec-
tive area up to the Fe-K band is needed. The shock-heated Fe
mass in Ejecta 1 is about one-third of that in Ejecta 2 (table 3),
indicating that a non-negligible fraction of the Fe ejecta exists
in relatively outer regions of the remnant. The outer Fe ejecta
may be formed either by an asymmetric explosion as suggested
for some Ia SNRs (e.g., SN 1006: Uchida et al. 2013) or by a
partial mixing of the stratiﬁed structure. Note that, however,
the Fe mass estimation of Ejecta 1 is highly uncertain as it is
primarily derived from the emission measure of Fe-L lines, and
thus the Fe mass ratio may also be inaccurate.

The spectral analysis also showed that an additional Fe-
ejecta component with a lower ionization timescale may be
needed (the models “d” or “e” in §3.2.4). While the ioniza-
tion structure in the model (d) is naturally expected even for
a simple ejecta evolution (Borkowski et al. 2001), that in the
model (e) requires some additional process. One possible cause
is a large non-uniformity of the Fe ejecta; if a denser clump ex-
ists in ejecta (e.g., Wang & Chevalier 2001), it gets larger τ .
Another possibility is anisotropy of reverse-shock arrival times
due for instance to a gradient in the ambient density. Toward
a denser direction, swept-up ISM mass dominates over ejecta
mass more quickly, and forms a reverse shock earlier, which re-
sults in a higher value of the ionization timescale. Finally we
address the third possibility, in which the dust contributes to X-
ray emission. If a signiﬁcant fraction of Fe is stored as dust, it
is gradually destroyed and melts into hot gas, supplying quasi-
neutral atoms in thermal plasma (Borkowski & Szymkowiak
1997). Such a component, if it exists, would have a lower ion-
ization timescale compared to the bulk gas component.

Figure 6 shows ionization timescales of IME-dominated and
Fe-dominated ejecta for a compilation of Ia (or candidate) SNRs
studied with Suzaku. Because the same instrument is used, this
plot enables us a straightforward comparison of the properties
of these remnants. We note that a systematic uncertainty orig-
inating from a possible variation in atomic codes is not shown
here but likely not so large as it interferes with the discussion

4.2 Updating the distance

In the previous X-ray studies (Reynolds et al. 2013, CO16, and
SE17), the distance has been assumed to be 8 kpc, a ﬁducial
value for the Galactic center (e.g., Reid 1993; Camarillo et al.
2018). This is consistent with the fact that we do not ﬁnd Hα
emission associated to the remnant in the SuperCOSMOS im-
ages (Parker et al. 2005), setting a lower limit of the distance to
be 4 kpc (Georgelin et al. 1988). The reported X-ray absorption
columns, NH = (1.5–2.0) × 1022 H cm−2, are indeed within a
typical range for objects in the Galactic center region. However,
the average ISM density in the direction of G306.3−0.9 is likely
much lower, suggesting a farther location of the remnant than
8 kpc. This is supported by the fact that the reported NH val-
ues are comparable to the Galactic total hydrogen column of
1.4×1022 H cm−2 along the line of sight (see below). Thus,
we further examine possible location of the remnant using the
velocity-decomposed Galactic hydrogen distribution.

The left panel of ﬁgure 7 shows the H I 21 cm emission ve-
locity proﬁle toward G306.3−0.9 with the Parkes Galactic All
Sky Survey (GASS: Kalberla & Haud 2015). There are four
major velocity groups arising from spiral arms at different dis-
tances d (table 2): the Centaurus arm at VLSR ≈ −30 km s−1,
the near and far sides of the Carina arm at −2 and +40 km s−1,
respectively, and the outer extension of the Perseus arm around
+80 km s−1, where VLSR is the velocity at the local standard
of rest. The locations of these intervening structures are shown
in the right panel of ﬁgure 7. The column densities contributed
by the atomic component (NH I) can be directly estimated from
the H I intensity. We ﬁt the proﬁle with an empirical model con-
sisting of 12 Gaussians, and derive NH I for each arm by mul-
tiplying a conversion factor of 1.82×1018 H cm−2 (km s−1)−1
(Spitzer 1978). For the molecular component (NH2 ), we uti-
lize the molecular fraction, fmol ≡ ΣH2 /(ΣH I + ΣH2 ), where Σ
is the surface number density of hydrogen atoms (Nakanishi &
Sofue 2016), as an indicator of the column density ratio along
the line of sight, i.e., NH2 ≈ fmol/(1 − fmol) · NH I. The total
hydrogen column densities for the individual arms are given in
table 2.

The NH values derived in the spectral ﬁttings correspond to
88–92% (models c–e; table 1) of the Galactic total. This indi-
cates that the most likely location of G306.3−0.9 is in the outer
extension of the Perseus arm at ∼20 kpc, which corresponds to
the column density of ≥88% of the Galactic total. This is sig-
niﬁcantly farther than the previously assumed distance, but it is
reasonable because in the direction to the remnant the average
density is lower than that toward the Galactic center. We note
that our estimation has systematic uncertainty. The ignorance of
the contribution from ionized material in table 2 would under-
estimate the total Galactic hydrogen column. Thus the distance
might be as near as the far side of the Carina arm (∼12 kpc),
but the 8 kpc distance is likely ruled out because the interven-

below (see appendix 1 for details). For those analyzed with
the plane-parallel shock (pshock) model (G337.2−0.7: Takata
et al. 2016 for both IME and Fe; N 103 B: Someya et al. 2014 for
Fe), only the upper-bound values τu are available, and thus we
estimate the average ionization timescales by ﬁtting simulated
pshock spectra with the simple nei model. We ﬁnd that the
approximated τ values are close to 0.5 τu as naturally expected
from the constant differential emission measure distribution in
pshock. The Galactic Ia SNRs show a systematic trend of dis-
tribution described as τ for Fe ≈ 0.1 τ for IME. G306.3−0.9
slightly extends this relation and occupies the top-right end, in-
dicating that it is one of the most thermally evolved systems.
The plot illustrates that the lagged shock heating of Fe ejecta
is ubiquitous in Galactic Ia SNRs over one order of magnitude
of τ . The trend could be explained at least partially by strati-
ﬁcation of ejecta in Type Ia SNRs. If these SNRs indeed have
stratiﬁed ejecta, our results suggest that the mixing of ejecta
is not so efﬁcient even in a relatively later stage of the Sedov
phase, where the interaction with ambient materials is not neg-
ligible. However, physical reality is undoubtedly more complex
and we need observations with higher angular resolution and
high spectral resolution to understand this better.

ing structures in this case (the near Carina and Centaurus arms)
account for only ≈70% of the Galactic total, leaving a signiﬁ-

distance would be even less likely if we adopt an alternative
X-ray NH value using an absorption model with a newer photo-
electric cross section (tbabs: Wilms et al. 2000); we get a 50%
larger NH, preferring an even farther distance to the remnant.
The different systematic factors may partially cancel to each
other. We hereafter adopt 20 kpc as the distance to this rem-
nant.

(MX) for each thermal emission component, as presented in ta-
ble 3, based on the best-ﬁt parameters with the multi-τ model
(c). Here we assume the total emitting region to be a hemi-
sphere with 11 pc radius because only the southern hemisphere
is bright in the Chandra images (CO16). For the ejecta, we
derive parameters individually for heavy elements with line de-
tections. Volume ﬁlling factors are not taken into account, and
thus the densities should be considered as lower limits and the
masses are upper limits. These parameters scale as d2, d−0.5,
and d2.5, respectively, where d is the distance to the remnant.

4.3 Global properties and evolutionary stage

With the parameters obtained by the spectral analysis (sec-
tion 3.2) and the updated distance (section 4.2), we here esti-
mate global properties of the SNR G306.3−0.9. At 20 kpc, the
angular radius of 110′′ converts to R =11 pc. We derive the vol-
ume emission measure (V EMX), ion density (nX), and mass

The total mass of the shocked ejecta is ≈1 M⊙ at 20 kpc.
This is in a good agreement with a view that the whole Ia ejecta
has been shock heated. The swept-up mass of the shocked ISM
(≈150 M⊙) is much greater than the ejecta mass. The Sedov
timescale ts, blast-wave shock speed vs = 0.4R/ts, and post-
shock temperature Ts are estimated as follows:

where d20, ρ1, and E51 are the distance, ambient medium mass
density, and explosion energy, in units of 20 kpc, 1 amu cm−3,
and 1051 erg, respectively. As shown in the equations, we
leave the ambient mass density as a parameter, ρ1, rather than
estimate it from the X-ray spectral ﬁts. This is mainly be-
cause it would largely be affected by systematic factors like
the ﬁlling factor. The series of evidence consistently sup-
ports that the SNR has already been entered into the Sedov
phase. The thermal timescale of ejecta after shock heat-
ing can be evaluated from the ionization timescale, which is
tioni ≈4.7 (ne/1 cm−3)−1 kyr for the IME-dominated ejecta.
This is consistent with the age of the remnant, whose upper limit
is set by the Sedov timescale derived above.

One may consider that the electron temperature of the Fe
ejecta (5 keV) is unusually high for the ejecta with an SNR
age of ∼6 kyr. Similarly high kTe values have been observed
in some SNRs, e.g., G272.2−3.2 (2.8 keV; Kamitsukasa et al.
2016) and G337.2−0.7 (3.1 keV; Takata et al. 2016). These

SNRs also have similar ionization timescales for IME (ﬁgure 6)
or a dynamical timescale (∼6 kyr for G272.2−3.2). The high-
est temperature components are always associated with the Fe
ejecta. This can naturally be explained by the fact that the
reverse-shock speed is initially low in frame of unshocked ejecta
but gradually gets higher as the shock penetrates into the inner
region (Truelove & McKee 1999), where the Fe-ejecta concen-
tration is expected if stratiﬁed.

In the spectral analysis, we found the excesses in the broad-
ening at Fe Kα (≈40 eV) and in the intensity of Fe Kβ with the
single-τ Fe ejecta modeling (the model c), which were later ex-
plained by the multi-τ components (in the model d or e). Here,
we brieﬂy revisit other possibilities for the origin of the broad-
ening in terms of consistency with the our ﬁndings discussed
above. The broadening corresponds to the velocity dispersion of
σv ≈2000 km s−1 if it is entirely due to the bulk motion. This is
comparable to the Sedov velocity (vs = 0.4R/ts ∼700 km s−1).
Alternatively, in the case of thermal broadening, the post-shock
Fe ion temperature of 2 MeV converts to the reverse-shock
speed of ∼5500 km s−1 if Coulomb cooling is ignored. These
estimates on the expansion speed (∼700 km s−1) and reverse
shock speed (∼5500 km s−1) consistently predict the shock-
heated age of Fe at ∼90% of the age at which the reverse shock
reaches to the center of the ejecta, using the analytical model by
Truelove & McKee (1999). The radial location of shock heated
Fe is estimated to be at ∼20% relative to the outer boundary
of the ejecta (or contact discontinuity; Tang & Chevalier 2017).
These numbers may have considerable uncertainties, but qual-
itatively agree with the global properties, namely that the SNR
has entered into the late Sedov phase and the reverse shock has
been reached to the innermost part where Fe is located.

The Ia origin argued by the previous studies is conﬁrmed
with our updated ejecta modeling. The Fe-K progenitor typing
method (Yamaguchi et al. 2014a) can discriminate Ia and core-
collapse origins and is even possible to constrain subtypes of
Ia SNRs by combining line centroid and intensity of the Fe Kα
line. The unabsorbed ﬂux of the Fe Kα line was measured at
(9.91+0.76
−0.77) × 10−6 photons cm−2 s−1. This corresponds to
the luminosity of 4.7 × 1041 photons s−1 at the 20 kpc dis-
tance. Combined with the line centroid at ≈ 6.48 keV, this puts
G306.3−0.9 at the middle of the allowed region for Ia SNRs
(ﬁgure 1 of Yamaguchi et al. 2014a). A recent proposal to dis-
tinguish Ia and core-collapse SNRs using the Fe/Ne ejecta mass
ratio (Takeuchi et al. 2016) can also be applied. In this method,
Fe ejecta is expected to have a larger mass than Ne in the case
of Ia SNRs. From table 3, we estimate the ratio to be 4.5+4.6
−2.7,
again conﬁrming the Ia origin. The relative abundances of trace
elements to Fe are also the key to constraining explosion mech-
anisms and progenitor subtypes. The Cr-to-Fe abundance ratio
is one example (Uchida et al. 2013). With the current data, how-
ever, the ratio ZCr/ZFe is poorly constrained to be 3.0<+4.6 so-

at ≈7.5 keV is also expected.

Finally we note that, in order to constrain the detailed ion-
ization structure in SNRs, not only high-resolution spectra but
also accurate and complete emission modeling is necessary.
Recently Hitomi observations of the Perseus cluster bench-
marked atomic codes for CIE plasma (Hitomi Collaboration
et al. 2018a). There is no such systematic benchmarks on NEI
plasma, but discrepancies between the existing atomic codes
(appendix 1) clearly indicate the need of substantial updates of
the atomic codes with laboratory data obtained by e.g., electron
beam ion traps.

5 Summary

We have presented a new Suzaku analysis result of the Galactic
SNR G306.3−0.9. The absolute energy scale of the XIS at 6–
7 keV was cross-calibrated to the micro-calorimeter data using
the Perseus cluster observations to study detailed thermal nature
of the Fe ejecta. We discover the lower ionization timescale of
Fe than IME using the band-limited ﬁttings, and establish multi-
component ejecta models to describe the full band spectrum.
The low ionization of Fe strongly suggests the chemically strat-
iﬁed structure of the ejecta, overturning the previous results. We
reﬁne the distance to the remnant to be ∼20 kpc using the H I
velocity proﬁle and X-ray absorption column density. By com-
bining the large ISM-to-ejecta mass ratio of ∼100, dynamical
timescale of ∼6 kyr, and lower ionization timescale for the Fe
ejecta, we identify a unique situation of this SNR where a pos-
sibly stratiﬁed ejecta survive in a dynamically evolved system.

mechanisms between delayed detonation model and classical
deﬂagration model (Iwamoto et al. 1999).

Resolve on XRISM (the same response as the SXS on Hitomi is assumed).
The black crosses are the simulated data based on the model (e) shown
with the black histogram. The light blue histogram indicates the contribution
from the lower τ component of the Fe-dominated ejecta (Ejecta 3 in table 1).
For comparison, the model (d) is shown with the gray ﬁlled histogram. The
Gaussian broadening with a velocity dispersion of σv =500 km s−1 is as-
sumed based on the forward-shock velocity derived in section 4.3. The ar-
rows indicate the structures with large differences between the two models.

High-resolution spectroscopy with micro-calorimeter spec-
trometers to be ﬂown on X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy
Mission (XRISM, formerly XARM) and Athena (Guainazzi &
Tashiro 2018) will extend the spectroscopic study of ejecta ion-
ization structure in Type Ia SNRs. The energy resolution of
≤5 eV combined with the energy calibration accuracy of ≤1–
2 eV makes the ionization timescale measurements much more
accurate. Also, as demonstrated by the recent Hitomi observa-
tion of the SNR N 132 D (Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2018b),
the ≈30 times better energy resolution enables us to detect and
characterize Fe Kα even with limited photon counts, extend-
ing the sample toward fainter SNRs. Also expected is to bet-
ter understand detailed nature of Fe ejecta, for instance multi-τ
components as suggested by the Suzaku spectrum in this work
(section 4.1). Here we brieﬂy demonstrate an example simula-
tion targeted for G306.3−0.9.

Figure 8 is a simulated spectrum for the Resolve micro-
calorimeter spectrometer on XRISM. With a reasonable expo-
sure time, we can easily distinguish the two competing models
with low ionization Fe. If the Fe ejecta has a discrete τ dis-
tribution (the model e, the black crosses and histogram), then
the spectrum exhibits narrow peaks at 6.40 and 7.10 keV (the
black arrows). These features have signiﬁcantly different en-
ergies or intensities in the case of the continuous τ under the
plane-parallel shock condition (the model d, the gray ﬁlled his-
togram), where the fraction of low-ionization ions of log10 τ <
∼9
is considerably suppressed. We note that the detection of Ni Kα

Appendix 1 Fe Kα centroids in ionizing
plasma with various atomic codes

Because the measurement of τ relies on the atomic databases
and spectral models (hereafter referred to as atomic codes),
here we summarize comparisons of calculations with different
atomic codes. Figure 9 shows ionization timescales based on
the Fe Kα centroids with major atomic codes, AtomDB/APEC
and SPEX. Model spectra were convolved with the XIS re-
sponse and ﬁtted in 6.0–6.9 keV with an empirical model of
a Gaussian plus bremsstrahlung. For the SPEX models, we im-
ported the simulated spectra into Xspec using flx2tab and the
atable model and analyzed them exactly in the same manner as
the AtomDB models to eliminate systematic differences in the
ﬁtting algorithms. In the old generation of the codes (version
2), the large inter-code deviations of ≈50 eV in the Fe Kα line
centroid or 0.5 in log10 τ are seen. For the recent codes (ver-
sion 3), the deviations are greatly reduced to the level within
±0.1 in log10 τ except for the very low ionization timescales of
log10 τ <10.0, but are still substantial even for the CCD resolu-
tion. These give a measure of typical systematic uncertainty in
observational constraints on τ (e.g., in ﬁgure 6). We note that
the deviations between different versions of the same code (e.g.,
SPEX versions 3.04 and 3.05) can be as large as those between
the different codes (AtomDB and SPEX) depending on the pa-
rameter range. Therefore it is important for both reproducibility
and clarifying a potential systematic uncertainty to describe in
a paper which version of an atomic code is used in the spectral
analysis, as done for analysis software packages and calibration
databases.

To get a basic idea on which factors are essential for the
inter-code differences, we further compare the Fe Kα spectra
in ﬁgure 10 for selected τ values with the recent versions of
the atomic codes. Thermal broadening assuming electron-ion
temperature equilibrium is applied4 but no convolution is made
for an instrumental response. The immediate result from the
comparison is that the number of emission lines and energies
of individual lines are the major factor on the deviations of τ
for the low ionization timescale of log10 τ ≈9.5. This is not
surprising as the atomic data are usually updated from higher to
lower ionization sequences (for instance, in SPEX, the atomic
line list of Fe ions for Mg-like or lower has not yet been updated
from version 2). On the other hand, this is not the case for the
higher τ values: the differences are rather seen in the relative in-
tensities of individual lines. The major source of the deviations
for log10 τ ≥10 is therefore either those in charge-state distri-
bution (Bryans et al. 2009 for AtomDB and Urdampilleta et al.

2017 for SPEX) or in relative emissivities particularly of inner-
shell excitation and ionization lines. For instance, the charge-
state distribution calculation by Bryans et al. (2009) does not
take into account the multiple-electron ionization due to inner-
shell ionization followed by one or more Auger ejections, which
partly accounts for the positive offset in τ of AtomDB 3.0.9
compared to SPEX 3.05. Even for relatively well calibrated
emission lines such as the He-like triplets and the satellite lines
of Li-like through C-like Fe ions in 6.55–6.70 keV, we see
many code-to-code and version-to-version differences, but for
the latest codes (AtomDB 3.0.9 and SPEX 3.05), these lines
show a close agreement in both the line energies and emissivi-
ties. This is likely due to the recent updates in the calculations
of inner-shell processes: a bug ﬁx on a factor-of-two overesti-
mated ﬂuorescence emissivities for Li-like through F-like Fe
ions in AtomDB (from 3.0.8 to 3.0.9)5 and improved Auger
rates for Be-like through N-like Fe ions in SPEX (from 3.03
based on Kaastra & Mewe 1993 to 3.05)6. The agreement, how-
ever, degrades toward the lower ionization lines, which results
in a larger systematic uncertainty in the τ measurement (ﬁg-
ure 9). This fact clearly demonstrates the need for further im-
provements on the atomic database and modeling particularly
for NEI spectra.
