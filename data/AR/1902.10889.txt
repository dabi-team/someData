Abstract 

Despite  the  recent  advances  in  augmented  reality  (AR),  which  has  shown  the  potential  to 

significantly impact on our daily lives by offering a new way to manipulate and interact with 

virtual  information,  minimizing  visual  discomfort  due  to  the  vergence–accommodation 

conflict remains a challenge. Emerging AR technologies often exploit focus-tunable optics to 

address  this  problem.  Although  they  demonstrated  improved  depth  perception  by  enabling 

proper focus cues, a bulky form factor of focus–tunable optics prevents their use in the form 

of  a  pair  of  eyeglasses.  Herein,  we  describe  an  ultrathin,  focus-tunable  liquid  crystal  (LC) 

diffractive lens with a large aperture, a low weight, and a low operating voltage. In addition, 

we show that the polarization dependence of the lens, which is an inherent optical property of 

LC  lenses,  can  be  eliminated  using  birefringent thin  films  as  substrates  and  by  aligning the 

optical  axes  of  the  birefringent  substrates  and  LC  at  a  specific  angle.  The  polarization 

independence eliminates the need for a polarizer, thus further reducing the form factor of the 

optical system. Next, we demonstrate a prototype of AR glasses with addressable focal planes 

using the ultrathin lens. The prototype AR glasses can adjust the accommodation distance of 

the  virtual  image,  mitigating  the  vergence–accommodation  conflict  without  substantially 

compromising  the  form  factor  or  image  quality.  This  research  on  ultrathin  lens  technology 

shows promising potential for developing compact optical displays in various applications. 

Keywords:  Augmented  reality,  vergence–accommodation  conflict,  focus  tunable  lens,

Augmented  reality  (AR)  is  a  technology  that  overlays  computer–generated  virtual 
information on a real-world environment  1,2. It allows users to  manipulate and interact with 

virtual  objects  in  the  context  of  the  real  world  around  them.  The  interface  between  an  AR 

system  and  a  user  has  evolved  to  the  form  of  a  pair  of  eyeglasses,  offering  users  a  more 

immersive  experience  in  various  applications  including  entertainment,  education,  training, 

and  marketing.  However,  conventional  AR  systems  have  been  known  to  suffer  from  the 
vergence–accommodation  conflict  for  the  past  decades  3,4,  which  causes  visual  discomfort 
such as visual fatigue 5 and depth perception error 4,6-9. Vergence is a binocular eye movement 

wherein the eyes are rotated in opposite directions to direct the visual axis of each eye on the 

same  object.  Accommodation  refers  to  the  adjustment  of  the  focal  power  (i.e.,  shape)  of  a 

crystalline lens to obtain a clear image at different depths. In a natural environment, vergence 

2 

 
 
 
 
and  accommodation  are  strongly  coupled.  Therefore,  the  vergence  distance,  which  is  the 

distance  between  the  eyes  and  a  point  where  two  visual  axes  intersect,  coincides  with  the 

accommodation  distance  (i.e.,  the  focal  distance).  In  conventional  AR  systems,  a  virtual 

image  is  formed  at  different  stereoscopic  distances  by  displaying  two  slightly  different 

images separately on each eye using see-through near-eye displays. This artificially induced 

binocular  disparity  leads  to  vergence,  yielding  a  different  vergence  distance.  However,  the 

accommodation distance is fixed at the optical distance of the displays. Therefore, a user may 

not  be  able  to  see  the  real  and  virtual  objects  in  focus  simultaneously.  This  limitation  is 

further  exacerbated  when  augmenting  a  relatively  close  real  object  with  a  virtual  image  or 
information, such as in surgical training 10.   
Among the various AR technologies that have been explored to address this problem 11-25, an 
interesting  approach  is  the  use  of  variable  focal  plane  near-eye  displays  10,26-32.  In  these 

systems,  the  focus-tunable  optics,  mostly  a  liquid  lens,  is  placed  in  the  optical  path  of  the 

virtual  image.  The  optical  power  of  the  focus-tunable  lens  is  adjusted  to  match  the  focal 

distance  of  the  virtual  image  with  the  vergence  distance.  Such  systems  exhibit  improved 
depth  perception  9,10,26-31,33  and  significantly  reduce  the  time  required  to  fuse  a  pair  of 
stereoscopic  images  34  in  a  human  visual  system.  However,  their  utility  is  compromised  by 

the bulky form factor and high operating voltage of the tunable lenses. Thus, these systems 

are  far  from  being  suitable  for  practical  use  in  the  form  of  a  pair  of  eyeglasses.  An  ideal 

focus-tunable  lens  for  compact  wearable  AR  glasses  should  be  thin  and  lightweight  while 

having a broad focus-tunable range, a large aperture, and a low operating voltage.   

Herein, we report an ultrathin (~266 μm), polarization-independent, and focus-tunable liquid 

crystal (LC) diffractive lens with a large area (a diameter of 20  mm), a low weight (1.5 g), 

and a low operating voltage (< 2.1 V). The lens was implemented using a nematic LC as an 

active layer and birefringent thin films as substrates. We show that a proper alignment of the 

optical axes of the birefringent substrates, which meet quarter-wave plate conditions, and LC 

helps  to  eliminate  the  polarization  dependence  of  the  LC  diffractive  lens.  In  addition,  we 

demonstrate  the  RGB  imaging  characteristics  of  the  lens  for  10  discrete,  switchable  optical 

powers ranging from −3 D to +3 D. Next, we demonstrate a monocular prototype of a near-

eye  see-through  AR  system  implemented  by  integrating  our  focus-tunable  lens  with 

commercial AR glasses. The prototype AR glasses can adjust the accommodation distance of 

the virtual image, providing improved depth perception without substantially compromising 

the form factor or image quality.

Figure  1a  shows  a  schematic  of  the  structure  of  the  lens.  The  homogeneously  aligned 

nematic LC is sandwiched between two birefringent substrates. The fabrication of the bottom 

substrate  started  from  the  indium  tin  oxide  (ITO)-coated  127  μm-thick  polyethylene 

terephthalate (PET) film. (See supplementary information section I for a detailed fabrication 

procedure). The 130 nm-thick ITO was patterned to form Fresnel zone pattern electrodes by 

photolithography. The Fresnel zone pattern electrodes consist of 46 Fresnel zones, with each 

Fresnel zone divided into 12 subzones with a 1 μm gap. The outer radii of each Fresnel zone 
35 and subzone  36 were determined corresponding to an optical power of 0.5 D and a phase 

difference  of  2π  at  each  Fresnel  zone  boundary  for  a  wavelength  of  543  nm.  As  shown  in 

Figure  1b,  the  subzones  with  the  same  indices  in  all  the  Fresnel  zones  are  electrically 

connected by an aluminum interconnect line (black lines) through via holes (red dots) on an 

SU-8 insulation layer. The Al lines are then extended to the contact pads. The top substrate 

consists of 130 nm-thick ITO coated on a PET as the ground electrode and poly(vinyl alcohol) 

(PVA)  as  an  LC  alignment  layer.  The  PVA  layers  on  the  top  and  bottom  substrates  were 

rubbed in an antiparallel direction using a velvet cloth. The two substrates were bonded using 

10 μm-thick adhesive spacers placed on the rim of one substrate. A commercial nematic LC 

(E7) was filled between the two substrates by capillary action. The thickness of the LC was 

uniformly  maintained  over  the  lens  area  using  bead  spacers  (diameter:  10  μm)  sprayed 

between the two substrates. Figure S1 shows the fabricated lens. As both the PET and LC are 

made  of  a  birefringent  material,  the  optical  properties  of  the  lens  strongly  depend  on  their 

thickness and optical axis alignment. To eliminate the polarization dependence of the lens, the 

extraordinary axis of the LC was aligned with those of the upper and lower PET films at 45°, 

while  the  optical  axes  of  the  upper  and  lower  PET  films  were  made  perpendicular  to  each 

other  as  shown  in  Figure  1a.  In  addition,  the  thickness  of  the  PET  films  should  meet  the 

quarter-wave plate conditions.   

To  demonstrate  the  polarization  independence  of  the  lens,  the  voltage-dependent  optical 

transmission of the homogeneously aligned LC sandwiched between the PET substrates was 

measured. For a direct comparison, the same measurement was performed for a conventional 

structure comprising a homogeneously aligned LC sandwiched between two glass substrates 

(glass/LC/glass). The measurements were performed in crossed polarizers for different angles 

(φ)  between  the  extraordinary  axis  of  the  LC  and  the  optical  axis  of  the  polarizer  while 

varying the voltage applied to the LC (see supplementary information section II). Figure 2a 

shows  the  maximum  (red  line)  and  minimum  (blue  dash  line)  optical  transmission  for  the 

4 

 
 
conventional  structure,  i.e.,  glass/LC/glass.  The  voltage-dependent  optical  transmission, 

which is translated into phase retardation, strongly depends on the angle between the optical 

axes of the LC and the polarizer. The electro-optic effects only arise for certain polarization 

states of the incident light, i.e., at angles of odd number multiples of π/4. For the angles of φ 

that are even number multiples of π/4, the optical transmission remains zero, regardless of the 

voltage applied to the LC. The polarization dependence problem in the conventional structure 

can be solved either by stacking two lenses with orthogonal extraordinary optical axes or by 
placing  a  polarizer  in  front  of  the  lens  37.  However,  both  approaches  decrease  the  optical 

transmittance  and  increase  the total  thickness  of  the  lens  substantially. Figure  2b  shows the 

numerical  prediction,  calculated  using  the  Jones  matrix,  of  the  voltage-dependent  optical 

transmission of the glass/LC/glass structure for different angles (φ). The prediction is in good 

agreement with the measurement results shown in Figure 2a. Figure 2c shows the maximum 

(red  line)  and  minimum  (blue  dash  line)  optical  transmission  values  of  the  LC  sandwiched 

between  the  PET  substrates  with  the  optical  axes  arranged  as  shown  in  Figure  1a,  i.e., 

(PET(0°)/LC(45°)/PET(90°)).  Unlike  that  in  the  conventional  structure,  the  electro-optic 

effect is induced for all angles of φ, indicating polarization independence of the structure. As 

shown in Figure S3a, the optical transmission oscillates between the minimum and maximum 

values as a function of the voltage applied to the LC. Figure S3b shows the phase retardation 

as a function of the voltage extracted from Figure S3a. The thickness and birefringence of the 

PET  are  127  μm  and  0.02215,  respectively.  This  yields  a  phase  retardation  of  65°  for  a 

wavelength  of  543  nm.  An  ideal  polarization-independent  lens  should  have  a  constant 

maximum and minimum optical transmission for all angles of φ. This can be achieved using a 

PET with a thickness of 128.5 μm, which meets the quarter-wave plate conditions. Figure 2d 

shows  the  numerical  predictions  of  the  voltage-dependent  optical  transmission  for  the 

arrangement  PET(0°)/LC(45°)/PET(90°),  calculated  using  the  following  Jones  matrix  (see

the tilt angle between the plane perpendicular to the propagating direction of the ray and the 

extraordinary axis of the LC, V is the voltage across the LC, d is the thickness of the LC, and 

λ  is  the  wavelength  of  the  incident  light.  Two  values  of  phase  retardation  of  the  PET  (∆1) 

were used in the calculation: the measured phase retardation of the PET and an odd number 

multiple of  π/2. The  calculation results for a phase retardation of 65° (red line) agrees well 

with the experimental results shown in Figure 2c. With  ∆1, which meets either one or three 

quarter-wave plate conditions, the polarization dependence was eliminated (green dash line), 

as the  above  matrix becomes  independent of φ (see supplementary information section III). 

Achieving  polarization  independence  eliminates  the  need  for  a  polarizer,  thus  further 

reducing the form factor of the optical system. 

Although the lens was designed to provide an optical power of 0.5 D with 12 discrete phase 

levels  per  a  phase  difference  of  2π,  it  can  be  electrically  reconfigured  to  provide  optical 

powers  of  ±1.0  D  with  six  phase  levels,  ±1.5  D  with  four  phase  levels,  ±2.0  D  with  three 

phase  levels,  and  ±3.0  D  with  two  phase  levels,  as  shown  in  Figure  3a  and  Figure  S5  (for 

±3.0 D with two phase levels). To demonstrate the characteristics of the lens, i.e., whether the 

optical power can be changed electrically, the images of a target located at different distances 

were  captured  using  a  model  eye  comprising  an  achromatic  refractive  lens  (with  a  focal 

length of 19.0 mm) and a charge coupled device (CCD). The LC lens was placed in front of 

the  model eye. The images were taken under white light illumination without a wavelength 

filter or a polarizer. Figure 3b shows the images of the USAF target printed in RGB colors on 

a  photo  paper,  captured  when  the  LC  lens  was  turned  off  (i)  and  on  (ii-v)  with  different 

optical powers. The target, which was placed at 48, 62, 93, and 193 cm away from the model 

eye, was brought into focus when the lens was on for optical powers of 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 

D,  respectively.  To  obtain  images  for  a  negative  LC  lens  power,  a  meniscus  lens  with  an 

opposite power was placed in front of the LC lens. The target located at a fixed distance of 60 

cm  away  from  the  model  eye  is  first  focused  using  the  model  eye  and  then  defocused  by 

placing a positive power meniscus lens in front of the LC lens, as shown in the first image (i) 

in Figure 3c. Finally, the  target  is brought into  focus again by compensating for the optical 

power of the meniscus lens using the negative power LC lens, as shown in Figure 3c (ii-v). 

Figure  3d  shows  the  modulation  transfer  function  (MTF)  of  the  entire  optical  system 

comprising the LC lens, a refractive lens, and a CCD with a resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels. 

The MTFs for different optical powers were determined by analyzing the images of slanted 

6 

 
 
edges  in  the  ISO  12233  resolution  chart  obtained  under  each  LC  lens  power.  The  MTF  50 

slightly decreases with the increase in the optical power, as shown in the inset of Figure 3d. 

This  is  because  the  higher the  optical  power,  the  lower  the  diffraction  efficiency.  The  MTF 

decreases  compared  to  that  of  the  model  eye  because  the  phase  retardation  of  the  PET 

substrate does not perfectly meet the one or three quarter-wave plate condition; nevertheless, 

this can be improved by engineering the thickness and birefringence of the PET, as shown in 

Figure 2d.   

To implement compact near-eye see-through AR glasses capable of controlling the depth of 

a virtual image, the LC lens is placed at the eye side of the commercial AR glasses, as shown 

in Figure 4a. It is noteworthy that only one ultrathin, lightweight LC lens was incorporated in 

the  commercial  AR  glasses.  Ideally,  an  LC  lens  should  be  placed  in  the  optical  path  of  the 

virtual image so that the AR glasses maintain the accommodation distance of the real object 

while correcting that of the virtual image using the LC lens. However, in this prototype, we 

deliberately utilize the zeroth and first diffraction orders of the LC lens to produce two foci: 

one for a nearer object and one for a farther object. When the lens is turned on, the zeroth-

order energy of the incident light is directed at the focal point of the refractive lens, whereas 

the first-order energy is directed at the effective focal point formed by the combination of the 

refractive and LC lenses. The first diffraction order efficiencies of the LC lens corresponding 

to  optical  powers  of  −2  D  (three  phase  levels),  −1.5  D  (four  phase  levels),  and  −1  D  (six 
phase  levels)  are  68.4,  81.1,  and  91.2%,  respectively,  in  theory  38.  The  remaining  incident 

light is distributed between the zeroth and higher orders.   

To  simulate  an  AR  training  task  performed  within  arm’s  reach,  for  example  in  surgical 

training, a real object (a teddy bear) was placed 45 cm away from the AR glasses. The virtual 

image (a heart) was displayed by the commercial near-eye see-through AR glasses at a focal 

distance of 310 cm. As shown in Figure 4b, the real object is seen in focus when focusing the 

model eye on the real object with the LC lens turned off, whereas the virtual image is out of 

focus  because  of  the  mismatch  between  their  accommodation  distances.  When  the  lens  is 

turned on with an optical power of −2 D, the focal distance of the virtual image is decreased 

to  45  cm,  bringing  both  the  real  and  virtual  objects  in  focus.  Figure  4c  shows  the  depth 

control  of  the  virtual  image  at  other  positions  for  LC  lens  powers  of  −1.5  and  −1  D, 

respectively. Three real targets were placed at 50 (K in red), 69 (N in green), and 97 cm (U in 

blue)  away  from  the  AR  glasses  as  references  to  the  depth  of  the  virtual  image.  When 

focusing the model eye at 69 and 97 cm, respectively, both the real and virtual toruses were 

7 

 
 
seen in focus for LC lens power of −1.5 and −1 D, respectively. The insets show the images 

captured  when  the  LC  lens  was  turned  off;  the  virtual  torus  is  out  of  focus  while  the  real 

target (K, N, U) is in focus.   

Despite the recent advancements in resolving the vergence–accommodation conflict in AR 

systems  using  focus-tunable  optics,  reducing  their  form  factor  remains  a  key  challenge  for 

developing  consumer-grade  AR  platforms.  We  report  a  substantial  progress  in  the 

development of focus tunable lenses that significantly reduce the form factor of AR systems 

by not only reducing the thickness of the lens but also by eliminating the need for a polarizer 

and a wavelength filter. Our initial study suggests that this lens technology can be potentially 

applied to AR glasses for improved depth perception without substantially compromising the 

form factor or image quality. In the future, we plan to develop compact gaze-contingent and 

adaptive  focusing  AR  glasses  by  integrating  the  lens  with  a  gaze  tracker.  Moreover,  time-

multiplexed operating of the lens will be explored. 

Materials and methods 

Details regarding the fabrication procedure for the lens and measurement procedure for the 

voltage-dependent  optical  transmission  are  given  in  the  supplementary  information  section. 

The  commercial  nematic  LC  (E7)  and  ITO-coated  PET  were  purchased  from  INSTEC,  Inc 

(USA) and Sigma Aldrich (USA), respectively. The birefringence of the PET was measured 

using a retardation film and material evaluation system (RETS-100, Otsuka Electronics Co., 

Ltd.)  with  a  wavelength  of  550  nm.  The  images  were  captured  using  the  model  eye 

comprising a achromatic refractive lens (with a focal length of 19.0 mm) and a CCD camera 

(DCU223C,  Thorlabs)  with  a  resolution  of  1024  ×  768  pixels.  The  12  voltage  waveforms 

used  to  drive  the  lens  were  generated  using  a  PCI-6723  analog  output  module  (NI).  Each 

channel generates a 100 Hz bipolar pulse with zero DC bias. The MTF was calculated using 

Imatest Master 5.1.22 (Imatest LLC). Commercial AR glasses (BT-300, Epson) was used for 

the prototype. The image of the heart was purchased from 123rf.com.

Numerical  prediction  of  the  voltage-dependent  optical  transmission  calculated  using  the 
Jones matrix for the PET(0°)/LC(45°)/PET(90°) structure with two different PET thicknesses. 
The  prediction  obtained  using  the  measured  PET  thickness  (127  μm,  red  solid  line)  agrees 
well with the  measured result. When using the thickness of the PET that  meets the quarter-
wave plate condition (128.5 μm, green dash line), there is no polarization dependence.

I. Lens Fabrication 

The lens fabrication started from cleaning an ITO coated PET substrate with acetone, IPA, 

and  DI  water  in  an  ultrasonic  bath  for  5  min  each.  The  sample  was  cleaned  in  UV  ozone 

chamber for 10 min. A photoresist, GXR 601, was spin-coated on the sample with 3500 rpm 

for  30  sec  and  soft  baked  at  110˚C  for  50  sec.  The  photoresist  was  exposured  to  UV 

wavelength  of  350  nm  with  an  energy  of  18  mJ  under  the  mask  for  Fresnel  zone  pattern 

electrode  in  the  mask  aligner  (MIDAS  MDA-8000B).  The  UV  exposed  area  of  the 

photoresist was developed by AZ300 developer for 50 sec. The photoresist pattern was then 

hard baked at 110˚C for 2 min. The ITO films not covered by the photoresist was etched by 

using  LCE  12K  diluted  by  DI  water  with  1:3  ratio.  After  rinsing  with  DI  water,  a  500  nm 

thick SU8 2000.5 layer was spin coated on the sample with 4000 rpm for 30 sec. The SU8 

was exposured to UV with energy of 26 mJ under the mask for via holes. The exposed area of 

the SU8 was developed by SU8 developer for 1 min 10 sec. The sample was then exposured 

to UV with a power of 10 mJ/sec for 5 min without a mask (flood exposure). The sample was 

rinsed with  acetone, IPA, and DI. A negative image reversal photoresist AZ 5214 was spin 

coated on the sample with 3500 rpm for 30 sec and baked  at 110˚C for 1  min. The  sample 

was  exposured  by  UV  light  with  energy  of  25  mJ  under  the  mask  for  aluminum  bus  lines 

followed by hard baking at 110˚C for 1 min 45 sec. The photoresist was developed in AZ300 

developer. The aluminum bus lines were formed by depositing 600 nm thick aluminum layer 

by using thermal evaporation followed by a lift-off process. The 2wt% of polyvinyl alcohol 

(PVA)  was  prepared  and  mixed  with  diameter  of  10  µm  bead  spacers.  The  PVA  was  then 

spin coated on the sample and baked at 90˚C for 1 hr. The PVA was also spin coated on ITO 

coated PET to fabricate a top substrate. The PVA layers on top and bottom substrates were 

rubbed by using a velvet cloth. A 10 µm thick adhesive spacers were placed on the rim of the 

bottom  substrate.  The  top  and  bottom  substrates  were  then  bonded  in  antiparallel  rubbing 

direction. A commercial E7 liquid crystal was filled into the cell by capillary action at 60˚C.

Figure S2. Measurement setup for the voltage–dependent optical transmission. 

 Figure  S2  shows  the  measurement  setup  for  voltage–dependent  optical  transmission  of  the 

homogeneously  aligned  LC  between  PET  substrates.  The  setup  is  comprising  a  543  nm 

wavelength He-Ne laser, an attenuator (ATT), a half wave plate, a spatial filter, a refractive 

lens (with focal length of 200 mm), an aperture, a polarizer, the LC lens, and an analyser. The 

intensity of the light incident on the LC was monitored by the optical power meter and kept 

constant  by  adjusting  an  attenuator  and  a  half  wave  plate  regardless  of  the  orientation  of 

optical axes of the polarizer. The spatial filter consists of a  microscope objective, a pinhole 

aperture, and a positioning mechanism. The refractive lens was used to collimate the beam. 

The angle between the optical axes of the polarizer and the LC was changed by rotating the 

optical  axes  of  the  polarizer  and  the  anlayzer.  The  angle  between  the  polarizer  and  the 

analyser was kept perpendicular to each other during rotation.  The optical transmission was 

measured for the different angles (φ) between the optical  axes of LC and the polarizer as  a

function  of  the  voltage  applied  to  the  LC.  All  12  electrodes  were  electrically  connected 

during the measurement.  

 Figure S3a shows the voltage–dependent optical transmission with angle between polarizer 

and  LC  lens  of  45  degrees.  The  optical  transmission  oscillates  between  the  minimum  and 

maximum value as a function of the voltage applied to the LC as the birefringence of the LC 

goes through full and half wave plate conditions. The voltage–dependent optical transmission 

can be translated into phase retardation of LC, and the relation between optical transmission 

in crossed polarizers (Icross) and phase retardation (δ) is described by

Icross=sin2(2φ)sin

(δ/2), 

(1) 

Where φ is the angle between optical axis of a polarizer and extraordinary axis of LC. Figure 

S3b shows the phase retardation as a function of voltage extracted from Figure S3a.   

III. Jones Matrix Equation    

The  retardation  in  birefringent  material  can  be  modelled  as  a  retardation  matrix.  We 

consider a PET and liquid crystal as retarders that introduce a phase difference (△) between 
ordinary  and  extraordinary  rays.  The  retardation  could  be  considered  as - △
2

 along  the  slow 

axis and + △
2

  along the fast axis. Thus, the incident light on a retarder can be represented by 

following complex number notation;  

                                                                P = (cid:3429)e-i△

A  retarder  introduces  a  rotation  (γ)  and  retardation  (△),  where  γ  is  the  angle  between  the 

ordinary  axis  of  the  PET  and  optical  axis  of  the  incident  light.  The  orientation  of 

extraordinary  and  ordinary  axes  of  the  retarder  with  respect  to  the  optical  axis  of  incident 

light can be represented as in the figure S4.
