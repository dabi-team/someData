Abstract

The current status of gaseous transport studies of the singly-charged lanthanide and actinide

ions is reviewed in light of potential applications to superheavy ions. The measurements and

calculations for the mobility of lanthanide ions in He and Ar agree well, and they are remarkably

sensitive to the electronic conﬁguration of the ion, namely, whether the outer electronic shells are

6s, 5d6s or 6s2. The previous theoretical work is extended here to ions of the actinide family with
zero electron orbital momentum: Ac+ (7s2, 1S), Am+ (5f77s 9S◦), Cm+ (5f77s2 8S◦), No+ (5f147s

2S) and Lr+ (5f147s2 1S). The calculations reveal large systematic diﬀerences in the mobilities of

the 7s and 7s2 groups of ions and other similarities with their lanthanide analogs. The correlation

of ion-neutral interaction potentials and mobility variations with spatial parameters of the electron

distributions in the bare ions is explored through the ionic radii concept. While the qualitative

trends found for interaction potentials and mobilities render them appealing for superheavy ion

research, lack of experimental data and limitations of the scalar relativistic ab initio approaches

in use make further eﬀorts necessary to bring the transport measurements into the inventory of

techniques operating in “one atom at a time” mode.

INTRODUCTION

While celebrating 1869 as the year of the Periodic Table’s discovery, one may also recall

other important milestones of its shaping towards the present form [1, 2]. The last element

found in nature was francium Z = 87 in 1939 [3], although a few more have been con-

ﬁrmed after being produced artiﬁcially. The synthetic era started in 1937 with technetium

Z = 43 [4]. The transuranium elements up to fermium Z = 100, discovered in 1952 [5], are

produced in nuclear reactors by neutron capture reactions. About the same time, mendele-

vium Z = 101 was synthesized [6] by a new recoil technique in “one atom at a time” mode.

This technique has opened the modern era of heavy ion fusion synthesis that is still being

used in high power accelerators [7, 8].

Although recent discoveries have been driven by physical methods, it is essentially chem-

istry that ﬁt them into the Periodic Table. Even the actinides had not found their proper

placement until the chemical analysis of neptunium Z = 93 and plutonium Z = 94 in the

1940’s [9, 10]. Since then, the chemical isolation of an element marks its discovery [11].

Sophisticated techniques of production, isolation and characterization of simple chemical

compounds in both gas and liquid phases are in use [7, 12–16] for superheavy elements to

determine their volatility, adsorption enthalpies and bonding parameters.

Information on the electronic structure and properties of bare heavy atoms and ions is

no less valuable. In particular, spectroscopic data enables ﬁrm assignments of ground state

conﬁgurations, irrespective of the chemical behavior.

In addition, it provides ﬁngerprint

spectral lines for use in the search for heavy and superheavy elements in the universe [17]

and benchmark data for ab initio methods of atomic and nuclear structure theory [18–24].

The recent review by [25] relates the progress in spectroscopic measurements to the use of

ion or buﬀer gas traps to collect a few atomic species emerging one by one from a recoil

separator.

It acknowledges that “quite good spectroscopic information is available up to

the element einsteinium (Z = 99)... up to the year 2003”. Since then, the bound has

been gradually pushed upward [26–28] to nobelium (Z = 102) owing to resonance ionization

spectroscopy of the neutral atoms inside buﬀer gas cells.

The extension of these technique to heavier elements is certainly challenging, mostly due

to decreasing production yield with increasing atomic number. Classical methods based on

ﬂuorescence detection suﬀer from low sensitivity, which renders them incompatible with one

2

atom at a time experiments [29]. Not surprisingly, studies of the gaseous transport properties

are currently being considered as prospective means for probing the superheavy ions [30],

not least for their compatibility with in-ﬂight separators that provide recoil ions [25].

From many measurements across the Periodic Table, gaseous ion mobility is known to

be sensitive to the electronic conﬁguration of open-shell ions [31–37]. It is a fundamental

property of an ion that deﬁnes, macroscopically, the rate of its steady-state drift through a

neutral buﬀer gas and reﬂects its microscopic interactions with the buﬀer-gas particles [38,

39]. In a sense, characterization of an ion through its gas-phase interaction with other species

is equivalent to chemical characterization by chromatography. By choosing monoatomic

inert gases as the buﬀers, one reduces the complexity of covalent chemical bonding to the

(relative) simplicity of the physical ion-atom polarization forces.

The theory of intermolecular forces tells us that the properties of a weakly bound dimer

can be reliably described by the properties of the constituting monomers [40, 41]. Thus,

ion-atom interaction potentials are very sensitive to the electronic structure of an ion, to

its electronic conﬁguration, electronic state symmetry, electric momenta, and static and

dynamic polarizabilities. Exemplary conﬁrmation of this for the main-group and transition-

metal ions has been provided by [42] and [43]. Ion mobility inherits this sensitivity. The

ﬁeld-induced drift discrimination of the ions in ground and excited electronic states [31–37],

known as the electronic-state chromatography eﬀect, is a direct consequence of the mobility

variation with electronic conﬁguration. It has been proposed recently [44] that this eﬀect

can be used for spectroscopic investigation of heavy and superheavy ions.

Measurements of ion mobility (equivalently, the drift time through a ﬁxed distance) are

indeed compatible with the separation and buﬀer gas trapping techniques. They are well

controlled by operating temperature, pressure and external ﬁeld strength. Potentially, they

can enrich our knowledge of electronic structure of ions produced in one atom at a time

mode.

The present paper addresses the current state-of-the-art in the studies of gaseous trans-

port of singly-charged lanthanide and actinide ions. Though far from being complete, exper-

imental and theoretical data for the lanthanide ions still permit us to analyze the relation

between the electronic structure of an ion and its mobility determined by the ab initio

ion-atom interaction potential. In particular, mobility trends for distinct electronic conﬁg-

urations and eﬀective sizes of an ion are established. To step into the actinide period, we

3

extend the scalar relativistic ab initio approaches tested for lanthanides to compute ion-

atom interaction potentials for selected actinide ions. We show that the trends found for

the lanthanides largely persist for the actinide family and thus can underlie experimental

exploration of their transport and, in turn, electronic structure properties. This also sheds

the light on potential use of transport properties for exploration of superheavy ions.

In sec. II we brieﬂy review the theoretical concepts and computational methods of ion

mobility in rare gases. Sec. III presents the review and analysis of the lanthanide results,

while ions of the actinide family are discussed in Sec. IV. Conclusions and outlook follow.

II.

ION MOBILITY AND INTERACTION POTENTIALS

Experimental techniques, general theoretical concepts and computational approaches rel-

evant to gaseous ion transport are described in detail in two monographs by [38] and by [39].

The macroscopic deﬁnition of the mobility, K, for trace amounts of drifting ions is given by

the equation

vd = KE,

(1)

where the vector, vd, is the ion drift velocity and E is the electric ﬁeld vector. Throughout

this paper, only the monoatomic rare gases He and Ar (collectively, RG) are considered as

the buﬀer gases. The ion mobility is deduced from the measured arrival time distribution

of the ions drifting through the tube of length l. In particular, the mean drift time td is

td = l/KE.

It is convenient to consider the standard mobility, K0, by the equation

K0 = n0K/N0,

(2)

(3)

where n0 and N0 = 2.6867805 m−3 are the buﬀer gas number density and the Loschmidt

number, respectively. The standard mobility depends on the reduced electric ﬁeld strength,

E/n0, and the temperature of the gas, T0.

From a rigorous theoretical standpoint, the ion mobility is a transport coeﬃcient deter-

mined by the solution of the Boltzmann equation, which accounts for anisotropic diﬀusion

and equilibration of the dragging electrostatic force by the momentum transfer that deter-

mines the stationary velocity of an ion through the buﬀer gas. The Boltzmann equation is

4

parameterized by collision integrals, which are expressed through the binary collision cross

sections [38, 39]. The cross sections are, in turn, fully determined by the ion-atom interaction

potential(s). Vice versa, knowledge of the zero-ﬁeld mobility over a reasonably wide range

of E/n0 or T0 is enough for direct reconstruction of the interaction potential [38, 45, 46].

The Gram-Charlier expansion of the ion distribution function provides the most sophis-

ticated approach for solving the Boltzmann equation for atomic ions drifting in atomic

gases [39, 47].

Its accuracy has been shown to be limited solely by the accuracy of the

underlying ion-atom potential [48, 49]. The Gram-Charlier method is used for all mobility

calculations considered in this paper. The results of these calculations have been placed in

the on-line database [50] within the LXCat project, that already has about 5000 tables of

theoretical and experimental results.

In the low-ﬁeld limit, which is the only situation considered here, K0 has only a slight

dependence on the gas temperature, as indicated by writing it as K0(T0). The Gram-Charlier

theory reduces in this situation to the one-temperature theory [38, 39] and the so-called zero-

ﬁeld mobility, K0(T0), obeys the fundamental low-ﬁeld ion mobility equation [39], which
contains the momentum-transfer collision integral, ¯Ω(1,1)(T0). According to [38] and [39],

this equation is

K0(T0) =

2π
µ0kBT0 !

1/2 3q
16N0

1 + αc(T0)
¯Ω(1,1)(T0)

,

(4)

where µ0 is the reduced mass of the ion-atom system, kB is the Boltzmann constant, q

is the ion charge (always +1 in electron charge units here), and αc(T0) is a temperature-

dependent correction term that is small enough to be neglected for heavy ions [39]. Note that
¯Ω(1,1)(T0) has the standard deﬁnition [51] as the temperature average of the energy-dependent

momentum-transfer cross section. Throughout this paper, the classical-mechanical cross

sections were computed using the program PC [52].

A complication arises when an ion has an open-shell electronic structure, as is the case for

the majority of singly-charged lanthanides and actinides. Non-zero electronic orbital angular

momentum, L, makes the ion-atom interaction anisotropic [53, 54]. The ion-atom collisions

controlling the ion transport may involve multiple underlying interaction potentials and the

respective cross sections depend on Λ, the projection of L onto the collision axis.

If, in

addition, an ion bears non-vanishing electronic spin, S, vectorial spin-orbit (SO) interaction

couples L and S into the total electronic angular momentum, J. The interaction remains

5

 
anisotropic in Ω, the projection of J onto the collision axis, if J ≥ 1. Moreover, if the SO

splitting is small, inelastic ﬁne-structure transitions can aﬀect the transport at elevated T0.

As the present paper primarily explores the relation between the ion electronic structure

and the ion mobility, through the ion-atom interaction potential, we will mostly consider

scalar-relativistic approaches. Vectorial SO coupling can be used in subsequent work for

accurate comparisons with experimental data.

Consideration of interaction anisotropy gives rise to some ambiguity. A transparent one-

to-one relation between the interaction potential and transport properties holds within the

so-called “isotropic scalar relativistic” (ISR) approximation that was ﬁrst introduced by [55]

for diﬀusion of neutral atoms. It assumes that the collisions changing Λ are very eﬃcient,

so that an atom “feels” an ion through the average isotropic potential V0. For ions in the
states of D symmetry (L = 2), like Gd+ (4f75d6s, 10D◦) and metastable Lu+ (4f145d6s, 3D)

of relevance here, the isotropic potential has the form

V0(R) = [VΣ(R) + 2VΠ(R) + 2V∆(R)]/5,

(5)

where Σ, Π and ∆ correspond to projections |Λ| = 0, 1 and 2, respectively, and R is the

ion-atom internuclear distance. Alas, the ISR approximation can be rather poor [56]. More

accurate is the “anisotropic” approximation (ASR), which assumes the conservation of Λ

during each ion-atom collision. The ASR implies that the transport cross sections should

be computed for each VΛ potential separately and then averaged with the same degeneracy

factors as appeared in eq. (5).

The sensitivity of the ion mobility to the interaction potential is well known [38, 39].

Extensive comparisons by [49] for ions lighter than caesium Z = 55 indicates that the poten-

tials calculated using an accurate single-reference ab initio technique, such as the CCSD(T)

(coupled cluster with singles, doubles and noniterative triples) method, normally provide

the zero-ﬁeld mobilities accurate within 0.05%. By contrast, multireference methods of the

conﬁguration interaction type (like MRCI, multireference conﬁguration interaction) are not

well suited for interaction potentials involving heavy ions. Accounting for the static elec-

tron correlation in a bare ion requires long expansions over conﬁgurations with multiple

high-angular momentum shell occupancies, while the recovery of the dynamic correlation

necessary to reproduce the polarization forces makes the problem intractable. As a result,

ab initio interaction potential calculations ﬁtting the accuracy required for transport prop-

6

erties are presently possible only for ions whose electron conﬁgurations are well described

in the single reference approximation. This limits the variety of ions studied using the

CCDS(T) method and considered below. Another concern is the strong relativistic eﬀects

inherent to heavy ions. Ion-atom interactions predominantly depend on the density of out-

ermost electrons and could be less sensitive to relativity than, say, electronic energy levels or

chemical bonding. Indeed, as we show below, scalar-relativistic eﬀective core potentials for

lanthanide ions permit one to reproduce the measured mobility quantitatively. The same

level of accuracy cannot be guaranteed for actinide ions and no direct comparison between

the measured and calculated mobilities is currently possible. However, we believe that scalar

relativistic CCSD(T) method is still able to capture qualitative trends in interaction poten-

tial and mobility variations along the family, while the applications of the more elaborate

relativistic method should be reserved for quantitative analysis to come.

Throughout this paper, we will use the following notations for ions. Complete speciﬁca-
63 Eu+(4f76s, 9S◦), includes the nuclear charge Z, the number of
neutrons in the nuclei, the electronic conﬁguration of outer shells and the term symbol in

the scalar relativistic approximation. Particular isotopes are speciﬁed mostly for measured

or calculated mobility data. In transparent cases, some of these symbols will be omitted.

When the SO splitting is considered explicitly, the J subscript is added to the term symbol.

III. LANTHANIDE IONS

A. Overview

Lanthanide ions provide a useful test case for assessments of the theoretical approaches to

heavy ion mobility and analysis of information about an ion’s electronic structure that can

be derived from the limited measurements. The ﬁrst relevant experimental study performed
64 Gd+
by [57] provided the zero-ﬁeld mobilities in Ar at 300 K for the 151
(4f75d6s, 10D◦), 159
70 Yb+
(4f146s, 2S) ions. Shortly after, two of us reported the ab initio CCSD(T) interaction poten-
71 Lu+(4f146s2, 1S)
in He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe for wide ranges of T0 and E/n0 (data available from the LXCat

63 Eu+ (4f76s, 9S◦), 156
68 Er+ (4f126s, 4H) and 174

tials and transport properties for the ground S-state ions Eu+, Yb+ and 175

65 Tb+ (4f96s, 7H◦), 165

67 Ho+ (4f116s, 5I◦), 168

database [50]). For the Gd+ ion in the rare gases, a combination of the CCSD(T) and MRCI

7

methods was applied together with an asymptotic model for SO coupling. Simultaneously,

the Eu+ (4f76s) interactions with the rare gases were calculated by [58] using the CCSD(T)

method combined with the large-core eﬀective core potentials (ECP), see also [59]. Man-

to 175

ions (2017) and then (2017) for the rest of the lanthanide family from 140

ard and Kemper measured the zero-ﬁeld mobilities in He at 295 K, ﬁrst for the same four
58 Ce+ (4f5d2, 4H◦)
71 Lu+ (4f146s2) except for 61Pm+ (4f56s, 7H◦). More sophisticated ab initio calculations
have allowed us to bring the Gd+ ion mobilities in He and Ar into agreement with the mea-
71 Lu+ (4f145d6s,

surements [56] and to evaluate the interaction potentials for the metastable 175

3D), as presented here.

Figure 1 provides an overview of the room-temperature zero-ﬁeld mobilities available

for lanthanide ions. Most of the ions have the 4fm6s ground-state conﬁguration and their

mobilities follow well-deﬁned trend lines. Remarkable deviations take place for a few ions

with diﬀerent outer shell occupancies: Ce+ (5d2), Gd+ (5d6s) and Lu+ (6s2). Noteworthy,

theory predicts quite similar mobilities for Gd+ and Lu+ in the metastable 3D state of the

same 5d6s conﬁguration, whereas the diﬀerence in the ground- and metastable-state Lu+

mobilities is huge comparing to the trend line variation. This clearly conﬁrms the sensitivity

of the ion transport to the ion electronic conﬁguration that underlies the electronic state

chromatography eﬀect [31–37]. On the other hand, the striking diﬀerence between the mo-

bilities in He and Ar gases looks surprising, not because of the magnitudes of the K0 values

(which arise due to the ion-neutral reduced masses and interaction strengths), but because

the trends with atomic number are so diﬀerent. While the mobility of the 4fm6s ions in He

generally increases with Z, that in Ar remains almost constant. Moreover, the change of

electronic conﬁguration causes opposite mobility variations in the two gases. This behavior

can only be understood by analyzing the features of the ion-atom interactions and their

manifestations in the transport properties. To justify such an analysis, we should emphasize

the very good agreement between the experimental and theoretical data shown in ﬁgure 1.

The most remarkable exception of the 156

64 Gd+ (4f75d6s) ion originates in fact from the vec-
torial SO coupling eﬀect [56]. Compared to the small-core CCSD(T) results, the potentials

obtained by the MRCI method lack the accuracy required for transport calculations [59].

Consideration of 151

63 Eu+ (4f76s) revealed worse performance of the large-core description of

lanthanide ions within the CCSD(T) framework [58, 59].

Interaction potentials

Here, we provide a brief presentation of the ab initio approach that was successfully

applied for the lanthanide ions to help understanding its extension to the actinide ions,

where no direct comparison with experiment is possible so far (see below). It relies on the

small-core (28 electron) ECPs adjusted at the quasi-relativistic, Wood-Boring, Hartree-Fock

level of theory, ECP28MWB [62]. The supplementary atomic natural orbital basis sets [63]

suﬀer from the lack of diﬀuse functions. The optimized s2pdfg diﬀuse augmentation [64] was

9

 
therefore used together with the segmented basis contraction [65]. He and Ar atoms were

described using the augmented, correlation-consistent, polarized basis sets aug-cc-pV5Z [66]

and the 3s3p2d2f1g bond function set [67] was placed at the midpoint of the ion-atom

distance. The CCSD(T) calculations were performed using the Hartree-Fock references

and kept the 4s24p64d10 shells of the ion and the 1s22s22p6 shells of the Ar atom in core.

For the states of D symmetry (Gd+ and Lu+ ions) Hartree-Fock reference wave functions

were obtained for each Λ separately, using either diﬀerent symmetry representations or

enforcing an electron population of the 5dσ or 5dδ orbital as described by [56]. The CCSD(T)
potentials were obtained on ﬁne grids of internuclear distances extending up to 25-40 ˚A and

corrected for basis set superposition error by means of the counterpoise procedure by [68].

The MOLPRO program package [69] was used for all calculations.

parameters of their minima, equilibrium distances Re and binding energies De, are presented

in table I. Tabulated potential functions are given in the LXCat database [50]. Note that for
the Gd+ (10D◦) and Lu+ (3D), only the isotropic potentials V0(R), eq. (5), are discussed here-
after. The lowest-order induction interaction, Vind(R) = −αRG/2R4, where αRG is the static

dipole polarizability of the rare gas atom (RG), does not depend on the nature of the ion and

determines the common features of interaction potentials at large separations. Indeed, the

deviations of De from Vind(Re) do not exceed 20%, being generally positive (more attraction)

for He and negative (more repulsion) for Ar. Equilibrium distance generally decreases with

Z for ions with the same valence electronic conﬁgurations. In contrast, population of the 5d

shell enhances the interaction energy and shrinks the equilibrium distance.

It is instructive to compare the overall shapes of the potentials by introducing the reduced

functions, V (R/Re)/De, as depicted in the right column of ﬁgure 2. In the case of He, the

reduced potentials are hardly distinguishable from each other except that for the Lu+ ion

with its unique closed-shell, 6s2 conﬁguration. The reduced potentials show an exception

for Lu+ with Ar too, but now with a softer repulsive wall. In contrast to He case, repulsive

interaction of the Eu+, Gd+ and Yb+, Lu+(3D) ions with Ar diﬀer slightly from each other.

This reﬂects the eﬀect of the 4f7 and 4f14 occupancies.

dot represents an accurate calculation [56] for the 156

example is used to illustrate the diﬀerence between ISR and ASR approximations.

While the good agreement between the experimental and theoretical mobilities at room

temperature demonstrated in ﬁgure 1 indicates reasonable accuracy of the scalar-relativistic

ab initio interaction potentials, only a wide temperature dependence of the mobility can fully

uncover the features pertinent to a particular ion-neutral interaction [38, 39]. Unfortunately,

no such measurements have been performed so far for the lanthanide ions, so only theoretical

12

 
 
dependences are available (see ﬁgure 3).

direct potential inversion [45, 46], summarized by Mason and McDaniel [38, chap.7] and

Viehland [39, chap.9], helps to connect, qualitatively, the radial dependence of the potential

and temperature dependence of the mobility. The low-temperature trend towards the po-

larization limit reﬂects the dominant interaction term, Vind, the mobility minimum features

an intermediate interaction range where attractive van der Waals forces of higher order are

also operative, the maximum is predominantly connected to the potential well, and the de-

creasing high-temperature branch reﬂects the repulsive interactions. Note that ﬂipping a

K0(T0) plot upside down and right to left, one sees a cartoon of an interaction potential. An

immediate conclusion is that the room temperature measurements in diﬀerent buﬀer gases

do not equally attest the properties of the ion. These and the ion-neutral reduced masses

provide a good but partial explanation for why the variations of the room-temperature mo-

bility with the nature of ion are so strikingly diﬀerent for He and Ar (see ﬁgure 2). However,

the electronic state diﬀerence also contributes substantially (ﬁgure 3). As a side note, the

slightly deeper mobility minimum in Ar can be mentioned for the reduced potentials of Gd+

and Lu+ (4f145d6s); these may reﬂect an interaction of the ion permanent quadrupole mo-

ment with the induced dipole moment of an atom, which is obviously absent for the S-state

ions [42].

D. Sensitivity to electronic conﬁguration

One way to quantify the mobility variations with the electronic conﬁguration of the ion

can be closely related to so-called electronic state chromatography eﬀect, or the discrim-

ination of the ground- and metastable-state ions by distinct mean drift times. Although

well studied experimentally for the transition metal ions [31–37], this eﬀect has not been

investigated for other ions. Theoretical results for Lu+ (4f145d6s) allow us to demonstrate

this eﬀect for the lanthanide family.

71 Lu+
through the individual mobilities. Figure 4 shows the zero-ﬁeld ∆K0/K0 ratios for 175
71 Lu+ (4f145d6s, 3D) ions as a function of temperature. The maximum
(4f146s2, 1S) and 175
diﬀerence in drift times in He and Ar amounts 30 and 15% at 750 and 1000 K, respectively.

The room-temperature diﬀerence in He, 22%, is comparable to those measured [35] for the

coinage metal ions (50, 25 and 13% for copper, silver and gold). These values attest the

discrimination between the ground nd10 and metastable nd9(n + 1)s conﬁgurations. Com-

parison for the third-row transition metal ions that have 6s and 6s2 ground and metastable

conﬁgurations, like Hf+, Re+ or Hg+, would be more relevant to Lu+ ion, but to our knowl-

edge none of these ions has been detected in metastable states in mobility experiments [33].

The same pictorial approach can be used for the mobilities of distinct ions in similar con-

ﬁgurations. From the present data, the eﬀect of “adding” a 5d electron to the 6s one can be

viewed for the Gd+-Eu+ and Lu+(3D)-Yb+ pairs. The corresponding ∆K0/K0 ratios (5d6s

ion is taken as the “metastable” state) are also plotted in ﬁgure 4. In general, they follow

a similar trend for each buﬀer gas, but the two trends are almost opposite. Interestingly,

the calculated mobilities demonstrate that higher sensitivity to electronic conﬁguration can

sometimes be achieved in Ar rather than He.

E.

Ionic radii

Eﬀective ionic radii are important parameters in crystallography, electronic structure

theory and molecular modeling. For heavy ions, their dependence on Z should reveal the

eﬀect of relativistic contraction. Though the eﬀective size of an ion can be extracted from

the ab initio interaction potentials themselves, it is important to understand whether or not

the transport measurements can provide a systematic means to probe the ionic radii, taking

into account exploratory experiments for the actinide ions [26, 70] and speculating to the

superheavy ions.

The ionic radius can be deﬁned simply as

Rion(R) = Re − RRG,

(8)

where Re is the equilibrium distance of the ion-RG interaction potential and RRG is the

15

atomic radius of the RG atom, here He or Ar. This deﬁnition was analyzed by [43] (WB),

who recommended the systematics based on He interactions (with the van der Waals radius of
1.49 ˚A) and noticed that signiﬁcant distortions of an ion electron density by Ar (RAr = 1.88
˚A) make the deﬁnition (8) inconsistent for that RG.

To deduce Rion (or, equivalently, Re) from the zero-ﬁeld mobility, one should use eq.
(4) and somehow relate ¯Ω(1,1)(T0) to the ion-neutral interaction potential. Within the hard

sphere (HS) model

¯Ω(1,1)(T0) = πR2
e.

Combining eqs. (4) and (9), one ﬁnds that

Re =

1/4

2
πµ0kBT0 !

1/2

3q
16N0K0(T0) !

.

(9)

(10)

Then one can easily obtain Rion from eq. (8).

In ﬁgure 5 radii obtained this way are compared with the parameters of the radial electron

distributions calculated by [71] for bare ions, namely, the mean radii of the 6s orbitals,

< rs >, and (if any) the 5d orbitals, < rd >, and with the maximum of the density of the

outermost orbital, rmax. The case of He provides a quite consistent picture. The WB radii
correlate well (within 15%) with the electronic parameters, being 1 and 0.8 ˚A larger than

rmax and < rs >, respectively, due to the presence of the He atom.

Eﬀective contraction of the bare ion radius in He when going from Eu+ to Yb+ amounts
to 0.15 ˚A, whereas the WB radius shrinks by 0.22 ˚A. In contrast, the HS model applied

to both experimental and calculated room-temperature mobility data gives smaller radii
and underestimates their contraction (0.09 ˚A for the Yb+-Eu+ pair). When applied to the

theoretical mobilities at their maxima, the HS model gives a more consistent trend; results
become closer to the WB deﬁnition and the Yb+-Eu+ contraction becomes 0.26 ˚A. Still,

the HS model works reasonably only for potentials of very similar shape. Even a minor

deviation at the repulsive wall in the case of Lu+-He interaction (see ﬁgure 2) causes an

artiﬁcial increase of the eﬀective radius.

In the case of Ar as the buﬀer gas, there is a much larger mismatch between the electronic

parameters and models based on ion-atom interactions and transport. The eﬀective ionic

radii derived from interaction potentials are too small in comparison to < rs > and even
rmax, show weaker Z-dependence and opposite variation for the “soft” Lu+-Ar interaction.

FIG. 5. The radii of the lanthanide ions determined from He (left panel) and Ar (right panel) data.

Presented are the WB radii from ab initio calculations and the results of the HS model applied to

experimental and calculated room-temperature mobilities “HS exptl” and “HS calc”, respectively)

and to the calculated mobility at its maximum (“HS calc max”). Blue color is used for 175

71 Lu+
(4f145d6s). Parameters of the ion electron distributions calculated by [71] are also shown; see text

for explanation.

This is in line with the analysis by [43] for lighter ions. The HS model works reasonably for

mobilities at their maxima but gives meaningless results for room-temperature mobilities.

IV. ACTINIDE IONS

The data on actinide ion mobility are very scarce. In fact, the only dedicated experiment
92 U+ (5f37s2) in He as a function of E/n0 and

is that of [72] who measured the mobility of 238

17

 
 
pressure near room temperature. Smoothed data are tabulated by [73] and are also available

in the LXCat database [50]. A few relative drift time measurements were carried out [26, 70]

in Ar for the 255

94 Pu+ (5f67s) ion pairs to
assess their eﬀective radii. Mobilities of U+ ion in all rare gases from He to Xe were also

a Large-core calculations, this work.

b Large-core calculations by [74].

Accepting scalar relativistic approximation for actinide ions, one can straightforwardly

extend the ab initio approach described above for the lanthanide family. Instead of the small-

core 28-electron ECP28MWB eﬀective core potentials, compatible 60-electron ECP60MWB

ones [75] with analogous segmented atomic natural orbital basis sets [76] have to be used.

The exponents of the spdfg set of the diﬀuse primitives (0.01, 0.008, 0.03, 0.07 and 0.05,

18

respectively) have been optimized for the polarizabilities of the neutral Am, No and Lr

atoms. The basis sets for He and Ar and other features of the CCSD(T) calculations remain

the same. The single-reference restriction limits the application of this approach to the

FIG. 6. Interaction potentials of the actinide ions with He (top panels) and Ar (bottom panels).

True and reduced potentials are shown on the left and on the right, respectively.

An alternative approach was suggested by [74].

It exploits large-core ECPs (“5f-in-

core”) that absorb 5s5p5d5f shells leaving for explicit consideration the outer 6s, 6p, 6d,

7s,... electrons only [77]. With this approach, electronic angular momenta and conﬁguration

mixing eﬀects due to incomplete 5f shell occupancies are hidden in the ECPs and the ground

electronic states of the ions acquire 1S or 2S eﬀective symmetry, except for 232Th+ (6d27s).

To test the diﬀerence with the small-core approach in a systematic way, we calculated the

CCSD(T) interaction potentials for the ground-state Ac+, U+, Cm+ and Lr+ ions with He

and Ar using the same large-core ECPs. In contrast to [74], we used the supplementary basis

sets of aug-cc-pVQZ quality without further modiﬁcation but augmented by the 3s3p2d2f1g

bond function set [67] placed in the middle of the ion-atom distance. The results are shown

in table II.

For the Ac+ ion without 5f electrons, the comparison apparently favors the large-core

description that gives slightly stronger ion-atom interactions. However, the opposite is seen

for the 5f7 and 5f14 conﬁgurations of Cm+ and Lr+ ions. The interaction strengths diﬀer

by 4-5% for He and by 5-6% in Ar, whereas the equilibrium distances diﬀer by 0.03-0.06
˚A. A reason for caution with the large-core approach is its modest accuracy for mobility

calculations of U+ in He [74] and for Eu+ in He [59] (with analogous “4f-in-core” ECP);

these were low by 8 and 4%, respectively, compared to the experimental values. Also, for

20

 
 
open-shell ions it permits only the simplest ISR calculation for collision cross sections and

transport properties. In what follows we will consider only the small-core approach, since it

is consistent with the lanthanide results summarized above.

The true and reduced interaction potentials for the actinide ions are shown in ﬁgure 6.

As in the lanthanide case shown in ﬁgure 2, interactions of the actinide ions with 7s and 7s2

outer shells diﬀer signiﬁcantly from each other. They exhibit weaker bonding and repulsion

that is stronger for He and softer for Ar. The dependence on the inner f-shell occupancy is

more pronounced than in lanthanides, in accord with the facts known from chemical inter-

actions. Actinide ions with the 7s conﬁguration interact with He more strongly than their
lanthanide counterparts, with Re reduced by almost 0.2 ˚A and De increased by more than
20%. In contrast, Re increases when switching from Lu+ to Lr+ ion with the ns2 conﬁg-

uration being accompanied by a marginal 2% increase of the binding energy. Interactions

with Ar are weaker for actinide ions regardless of the outer conﬁguration. Overall, the two

ion families demonstrate impressive similarity in their interaction potentials. This is illus-

trated in ﬁgure 7 that presents the potentials for various analogs. Especially telling are the

reduced potentials showing that the diﬀerence due to outer ns occupancy decreases from

the lanthanides to the actinides. Note that reduced potentials for the No+ and Yb+ are

indistinguishable from those of Am+ and Eu+ at the scale of the ﬁgure.

B.

Ion mobility

The interaction potentials described above were used to compute the mobilities of 227

89 Ac+
103Lr+ (5f147s2) in He and Ar.
The calculated temperature dependences shown in ﬁgure 8 exhibit trends similar to those

102No+ (5f147s) and 255

96 Cm+ (5f77s2), 254

95 Am+ (5f77s), 247

(7s2), 241

found in lanthanides. The mobility maxima in He for ions with both 7s and 7s2 conﬁgura-

tions are slightly reduced and shifted towards higher temperatures. The trend of increasing

mobility with Z is visible for ions of both groups, Am+-No+ and Ac+-Cm+-Lr+. Experi-

mental data by [72] for U+ in He, though somewhat uncertain, does not support the latter

trend, but ﬁts to the theoretical results for 7s2 group. In Ar, the mobility of the ions with 7s2

conﬁguration follows the reverse trend, decreasing along the Ac+-Cm+-Lr+ sequence, while

the diﬀerence in Am+ and No+ mobilities becomes marginal. As discussed above, such a

reversal also takes place for lanthanide ions of the 5d6s conﬁguration and, similarly, mirrors

lanthanide analog Lu+-Yb+. In He, all three pairs behave similarly, giving room-temperature

drift time diﬀerence of 10-15%. As has been already mentioned, the diﬀerence in the mobility

of 7s and 7s2 ions in Ar has the opposite sign. Interestingly, the diﬀerence due to 5f shell

occupancy between Cm+-Am+ and Lr+-No+ is larger than that between the lanthanide and

actinide families.

Overall, the eﬀect on the mobility in both buﬀer gases of outer ns shell occupancy in the

lanthanide and actinide ions is smaller than the eﬀect of 5d occupancy considered above for

the lanthanides. The ground-state calculations do not allow us to estimate the sensitivity of

actinide mobility to the 5d conﬁguration responsible for the electronic state chromatography

eﬀect for the metastable states. This would require interaction potential calculations for the

excited metastable states. Experience with the lanthanide family shows that the present

ab initio methods are likely applicable only for Ac+ and Lr+ ions in their 6d7s metastable

states.

D.

Ionic radii

The models used in sec. III E for lanthanide ionic radii can also be tested for actinide ions.

The results are summarized in ﬁgure 10 that follows the format of ﬁgure 5. Parameters of the

electron distributions of the bare ions taken from the same source [71] split into two parallel

23

 
trend lines for ions with the 7s2 (lower) and 7s (upper) outer shell conﬁgurations. The WB

radii for ion-He interactions available from the present calculations follow the opposite order.

The obvious reason already discussed is the enhancement of repulsive electronic interactions

for the ﬁlled outer s shell. The radii extracted from the mobility analysis within the HS

model show qualitatively similar variations and agree well in magnitude with the results for

the lanthanide ions. Figure 10 conﬁrms that the results of HS model are much less consistent

and informative in the case of Ar. The 7s and 7s2 trends are less evident for the parameters

derived from interaction potentials and mobilities, except for the room-temperature HS

result. The latter, however, wrongly predicts a general increase of ionic radii with Z. It

is important to mention in this regard the relative measurements of the drift times for the

Pu+-Am+ and Cf+-Fm+ pairs of ions in Ar [26, 70]. The HS model estimated the relative

contraction of the ionic radii in these pairs as 3.1±1.3 and 2%, respectively. [71] have already

discussed these variations in terms of electronic structure parameters of the bare ions. The

present analysis indicates that the drift times in Ar at room temperature correspond to the

mobility minimum and may not be sensitive to the eﬀective size of an ion. Quantitative

interpretation of such data within the oversimpliﬁed HS model requires caution, as pointed

out by [25].

V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Progress in the one atom at a time production of the heavy and superheavy elements

calls for new experimental techniques capable of characterizing the electronic structure of

nascent or neutralized fusion products. Measurements of transport properties of the ions,

in particular their gaseous mobilities, have already been counted among the most likely

approaches, at least from the technical standpoint [25, 30]. The lanthanide and actinide

families serve as a natural example for interpretation of such measurements in terms of elec-

tronic structure parameters. They can also provide solid grounds for assessing the accuracy

of ab initio calculations of ion-atom interaction potentials and transport properties, which

are invaluable for guiding complicated and expensive on-line experiments in one atom at a

time mode.

The conclusion of the present analysis is that the mobility is very sensitive to the electronic

conﬁguration of the ion. Both room-temperature measurements and ab initio theoretical

FIG. 10. The radii of the actinide ions determined from He (left panel) and Ar (right panel) data.

Presented are WB radii from ab initio calculations and the results of the HS model applied to

experimental and calculated room-temperature mobilities “HS exptl” and “HS calc”, respectively)

and to the calculated mobility at the maximum (“HS calc max”). Parameters of the ion electron

distribution calculated by [71] are also shown; see sec. III E for explanation.

calculations for the lanthanide ions reveal sharp deviations in the mobilities of the 5d6s and

6s2 ions from the trend line for the 6s ions, and slowly varying changes with 4f shell occupancy

(equivalently, atomic number). Comparison between experiment and theory shows that the

latter is presently able to predict the mobility diﬀerences for lanthanide ions in the ground

and metastable states and to determine the conditions (buﬀer gas temperature, reduced

electric ﬁeld strength, pressure, etc.) for achieving the best discrimination of the ions by their

drift times. Here, we have extended this conclusion to the actinides, which are unexplored

experimentally. We found signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the mobility of 7s and 7s2 ions, which ﬁnds

25

 
 
qualitative conﬁrmations in the spatial electron density distributions of the bare ions [71].
Supplementing the profound eﬀect of the ndm ↔ ndm−1(n + 1)s electron promotion on the

mobility already known for transition metal ions [31–37], discrimination of the ns, (n−1)dns

and ns2 conﬁgurations have direct implications for probing the electronic conﬁgurations of

the superheavy elements with Z = 104 − 112. Another important application is the so-

called laser resonance chromatography proposal for indirect detection of the spectroscopic

transitions by discrimination of the ions in metastable states [44], which is currently being

explored for the Lu+ and Lr+ ions.

The present overview demonstrates that the current theoretical state of the art allows

one to interpret and predict trends in the mobility of heavy ions. Standard (and relatively

cheap) scalar relativistic, single-reference, ab initio methods are able to link the electronic

structure of selected ions and their transport properties by means of the ion-atom interaction

potentials. Predicted changes in the mobility upon the electronic excitations are useful

for advancing experimental methods of ion discrimination. At the same time, the lack of

experimental data strongly limits the quantitative assessment of the ab initio results and

further development of the theory. Measurements of the mobility as function of temperature

or E/N are absent for most of the elements above Ba. Indeed, only two room-temperature

mobility values for lanthanide ions, i.e. for Gd+(10D) ion in He and Ar [57, 60], are available

to compare the performance of the single- and multi-reference methods, to assess the role of

vectorial spin-orbit coupling and to establish the uncertainty of the transport calculations

for heavy, open-shell ions. Careful analysis reported here roughly estimated the respective

variances as 20, 10 and 5% [56]. This indicates the need for testing multi-reference coupled

cluster techniques [78] in combination with SO conﬁguration interaction methods. Such

a demanding approach, however, will probably need to be customized for each particular

lanthanide ion for which experimental data exists. Experimental mobilities for the actinides

and even more diﬃcult theoretical calculations remain for the future. Only by means of

aligned experimental and theoretical eﬀorts can the frontier of ion transport studies be

pushed from the present scattered reconnaissance to a legitimate inventory of heavy- and

superheavy ion research.
