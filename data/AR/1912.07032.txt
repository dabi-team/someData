Abstract Using magnetographic data provided by the Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we analyzed the struc-
ture of magnetic ﬁelds and vertical electric currents in six active regions (ARs)
with diﬀerent level of ﬂare activity. We found that electric currents are well
balanced over the entire AR: for all of them the current imbalance is below 0.1%,
which means that any current system is closed within an AR. Decomposition of
the transverse magnetic ﬁeld vector into two components allowed us to reveal
the existence of large-scale vortex structures of the azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld
component around main sunspots of ARs. In each AR, we found a large-scale
electric current system occupying a vast area of an AR, which we call distributed
electric current. For ARs obeying the Hale polarity law and the hemispheric
helicity sign rule, the distributed current is directed upward in the leading part
of an AR and it appears to be closing back to the photosphere in the following
part of an AR through the corona and chromosphere. Our analysis of the time
variations of the magnitude of the distributed electric currents showed that low-
ﬂaring ARs exhibit small variations of the distributed currents in the range of
±20×1012 A, whereas the highly ﬂaring ARs exhibited signiﬁcant slow variations
of the distributed currents in the range of 30 − 95 × 1012 A. Intervals of the
enhanced ﬂaring appear to be co-temporal with smooth enhancements of the
distributed electric current.

1. Introduction

It is widely accepted that the energy released during solar ﬂares and coronal
mass ejections is stored in active regions (ARs) in the solar corona in the form
of the so-called “free” magnetic energy associated with the presence of electric
currents (e.g., Abramenko, Gopasiuk and Ogir’, 1991; Melrose, 1991; Wang et
al., 1996; Schrijver et al., 2005; Aschwanden, 2013; Fleishman and Pevtsov, 2018;
Toriumi and Wang, 2019, to mention a few).

The issues that are actively discussed over the last decades are (i) the origin
of these electric currents and (ii) whether these electric currents are neutralized.
The neutralization of electric currents implies that no net current over one
magnetic polarity of an AR at the photosphere level is present (Wheatland,
2000). In this case, the current system associated with a magnetic tube should
consist of a direct current (presumably ﬂowing in the central part of the tube)
and a return (surface) current.

There are two ways in which electric currents may be built up in the corona.

The ﬁrst one is due to twisting or shearing of a magnetic ﬂux tube by (sub)photospheric
plasma motions (e.g., McClymont and Fisher, 1989; T¨or¨ok and Kliem, 2003;
Aulanier, D´emoulin and Grappin, 2005; Dalmasse et al., 2015). Alternatively, a
current-carrying magnetic ﬂux tube may emerge from beneath the photosphere
(Leka et al., 1996; Longcope and Welsch, 2000), i.e, it could be twisted during
its formation and/or during buoyant rising through the convection zone (e.g.,
Cheung and Isobe, 2014).

Observations show that although electric currents integrated over the area
of the entire AR are balanced to a good degree (e.g., Abramenko, Wang and
Yurchishin, 1996; Schrijver et al., 2008; Georgoulis, Titov and Miki´c, 2012), the
current patterns remain non-neutralized at each magnetic polarity (Georgoulis,
Titov and Miki´c, 2012). One evidence of a non-neutralized current pattern is
the well-established hemispheric segregation rule of the sign of current helic-
ity in ARs (Seehafer, 1990; Pevtsov, Canﬁeld, and Metcalf, 1994; Abramenko,
Wang and Yurchishin, 1996; Bao and Zhang, 1998). Indeed, as it was argued by
Wheatland (2000), since most of ARs exhibit a non-zero averaged current helicity
hBzJzi the net electric current determined over opposite magnetic polarities
must be non-zero and must be of opposite signs.

Since uninterrupted high-spatial-resolution data on vector magnetic ﬁelds pro-

vided by space-borne instruments (e.g., the Solar Optical Telescope/Spectropolarimeter
on board Hinode, Kosugi et al., 2007; the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, SDO/HMI, Schou et al., 2012) have
become available, the evolution and dynamics of electric current patterns inside
ARs were analyzed by many researchers in more detail. The pattern of electric
currents in ﬂare-productive NOAA AR 10930 was studied in a number of works
(e.g., Ravindra et al., 2011; Georgoulis, Titov and Miki´c, 2012). This AR
with a strong polarity inversion line (PIL) was associated with emergence of
a new magnetic ﬂux and it produced several X- and M-class ﬂares (Kubo et al.,
2007). Ravindra et al. (2011) evaluated net electric currents in NOAA AR 10930
separately in positive and negative magnetic polarities. They found that the
net electric currents increased in both magnetic polarities simultaneously with

SOLA: ms6_arxiv.tex; 17 December 2019; 1:51; p. 2

Distributed Electric Currents in Solar ARs

the emergence of magnetic ﬂux. Besides, these net currents behaved in exactly
the opposite way implying that the current ﬂowed from one polarity to the
corona and returned back to the photosphere in the other polarity. The authors
attributed variations of net electric currents to the changes of the magnitude of
the shear along the PIL where the strongest currents were concentrated.

Georgoulis, Titov and Miki´c (2012) used a sophisticated technique to reveal
the existence of non-neutralized currents inside ARs. They analyzed the same
ﬂare-productive NOAA AR 10930 and ﬂare-quiet AR 10940. AR magnetograms
were divided into partitions, with each partition representing a distinct magnetic
element of one polarity. The net electric current was calculated in each partition.
A partition was assumed to be non-neutralized if the net current in it exceeded
an evaluated uncertainty. These authors found that the strongest net current
appeared in partitions located along the PIL in NOAA AR 10930. The net
currents in NOAA AR 10940 were not as pronounced as in NOAA AR 10930 since
the former did not possess a strong PIL. Interestingly, in both ARs magnetic
partitions of a given polarity had the same sign of the net electric current.

Gosain, D´emoulin and L´opez Fuentes (2014) analyzed current patterns in two
magnetically-isolated sunspots NOAA 11084 and 11092. High-spatial-resolution
data provided by Hinode/SOT-SP allowed them to analyze electric current dis-
tribution inside sunspot umbra and penumbra. Strong elongated electric current
patches of alternating sign were detected along the penumbral ﬁbrils in sunspots.
In order to reveal large-scale current patterns associated with the possible global
twist, these authors decomposed the electric current into parallel and orthogonal
components of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld. Although the analyzed sunspots
exhibited diﬀerent sense of twist, the current patterns were quite similar. In both
sunspots, a strong positive current was found at the central umbral part of the
orthogonal component. A thin annulus of a negative electric current outlined the
positive umbral current in both cases. The authors suggested that this feature
might be associated with return currents.

Liu et al. (2017) studied the relationship between net electric currents, mag-
netic shear angle, and eruption events in four ARs. They assumed that electric
currents of opposite signs within one magnetic polarity represent direct and
return currents. Their approach revealed that the ratio of direct to return cur-
rents is close to unity in ﬂare-quiet ARs, implying nearly full neutralization. On
the other hand, ARs with higher direct/return current ratio exhibited higher
level of ﬂare and eruptive activity thus supporting earlier results by Georgoulis,
Titov and Miki´c (2012) and Ravindra et al. (2011). These observational ﬁndings
suggest that ﬂaring activity of an AR may be inversely related to the degree
of current neutralization in the AR. This conclusion was further supported in
a recent statistical study by Kontogiannis et al. (2017) who compared non-
neutralized currents to ﬂare productivity of ARs. Their data covered 336 random
days between September 2012 and May 2016 resulting in almost ten thousand
of data points. The technique described in Georgoulis, Titov and Miki´c (2012)
was used to evaluate the net currents and their uncertainties. Kontogiannis et
al. (2017) showed that the total net current in an AR is a good predictor of its
ﬂare productivity.

The observational detection of return currents is an important milestone for
a number of theoretical models that are focused on connection between electric

currents and coronal mass ejections (e.g., D´emoulin and Aulanier 2010, see also
Introductions in Georgoulis, Titov and Miki´c 2012 and Dalmasse et al., 2015).
Simpliﬁed theoretical 2.5D models (Dalmasse et al., 2015) predict that, with
no respect to the exact mechanism of the electric current generation, electric
current in a well conﬁned and isolated twisted/sheared magnetic ﬂux tube must
be neutralized (e.g., Melrose, 1991; Parker, 1996). Melrose (1991) further sug-
gested that failure to detect return currents may be explained either by very low
magnitudes (below the detection threshold) of these currents that are distributed
over a vast area around ARs or by the fact that these currents are very strong and
highly concentrated over a small unresolved areas. An alternative explanation is
that the return currents may be located below the photosphere (see Figures 3
and 4 in Melrose 1995).

Instrumentation limitations could be overcome by sophisticated 3D magne-
tohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations. Thus, both direct and return
currents were found in initially potential magnetic ﬂux tube stressed by photo-
spheric twisting in simulations performed by Aulanier, D´emoulin and Grappin
(2005). Diﬀuse return currents were observed around each magnetic polarity. The
current neutralization problem was addressed in numerical 3D MHD simulations
of current-carrying magnetic ﬂux tube emergence carried out by T¨or¨ok et al.
(2014). In their experiment, an initially current-neutralized magnetic ﬂux buoy-
antly emerged to the plane stratiﬁed atmosphere. A complex redistribution of
electric currents observed after the onset of an intense emergence. Predominantly
direct currents appeared above the photosphere level resulting in a strong net
electric currents in the corona.

Formation of net currents was also scrutinized in a 3D MHD simulations by
Dalmasse et al. (2015), where potential line-tied magnetic ﬁelds were stressed by
photospheric twisting and shearing motions. These authors argued that buildup
of a neutralized electric currents system is an exception.

The above review shows that photospheric electric currents in an AR appear
to be non-neutralized. Moreover, the degree of non-neutralization seems to be
related to the ﬂaring productivity. In spite of the great importance of this con-
clusion, from both theoretical and ﬂare-forecast standpoints, the approach does
not oﬀer a reliable way to reveal a large-scale, widely distributed electric current
system because the requirement of unipolarity might be violated. In general, the
large signiﬁcant distributed currents may be spread over a large area with both
polarities. How to outline the boundary of such a current system then?

Here we renew an approach, which was proposed earlier in Abramenko and
Gopasyuk (1987) and later elaborated in Abramenko, Gopasiuk and Ogir’ (1991).
We decompose the observed transverse magnetic ﬁeld vector Bt into two com-
ponents: parallel to the calculated potential transverse ﬁeld, and orthogonal
to the potential transverse ﬁeld, Bt⊥. The latter, Bt⊥ component is generated
exclusively by the present electric currents.

In these studies we had found that in some areas of an AR the structure of
Bt⊥ is well organized and forms a large-scale vortex-like structure (with minor
disturbances). Such a structure represents an azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld associated
with a large vertical electric current and a boundary of the vortex encloses
the distributed electric current. We emphasize that this approach does not rely

Distributed Electric Currents in Solar ARs

on the polarity of magnetic elements covered by the vortex, nevertheless we
note that the main spots of an AR are usually located at center of the vortex.
With poor-resolution magnetographic data, we reported the magnitude of the
distributed current to be of order of 2×1012 A (Abramenko and Gopasyuk, 1987;
Abramenko, Gopasiuk and Ogir’, 1991). In these studies two bipolar ARs located
in diﬀerent hemispheres were analyzed. In each AR, two large vortexes were
revealed: one around the leading spot, and another, less pronounced, covered
the spots in the following part of the AR. In both ARs, the distributed electric
current was directed upward in the leading vortex and downward in the following
one. As soon as the (local small-scale) vertical currents were well-balanced in
both ARs, a conclusion was made that the distributed upward current of the
leading vortex is closed (through the chromosphere and corona) in the following
vortex.

In the present paper, we apply this approach to six ARs with diﬀerent mag-
netic class. In Section 2, we describe data selection and reduction, a procedure of
calculation of local (resolution-scale) and large distributed currents is discussed
in Section 3, analysis of time variations of currents and other AR parameters is
presented in Section 4, and our conclusions are listed in the last section.

2. Data Selection and Reduction

For our study we selected six ARs listed in Table 1. The guideline for selection
was as follows. First, the set must represent both ﬂare-quiet and ﬂare-productive
ARs. The top three ARs listed in Table 1 are low-ﬂaring groups. The other
three exhibited enhanced ﬂaring activity. The ARs in Table 1 are ordered by
the increasing ﬂare index, FI (4th column in Table 1), which represents ﬂare
productivity of an AR (Abramenko, 2005) and equals 1 (100) for an AR, that
produced one C1.0 (X1.0) ﬂare per day. Second, ﬂaring ARs should represent
the essential magnetic structures. Thus, AR NOAA 12158 is an anti-Hale group
(with wrong leading polarity), 12371 is a bipolar and 12192 is a multipolar group.
The main data source used in this work was SDO/HMI vector magnetic
ﬁeld measurements provided by the Joint Science Operation Center (JSOC,
http://jsoc.stanford.edu/). SDO/HMI is a 4096×4096 pixel full-disk ﬁl-
tergraph that routinely performs measurements of full Stokes vector in Fe I
6173 ˚A spectral line (Schou et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012). The Stokes vector
measurements are used to derive full-disk vector magnetograms, Dopplergrams,
and other quantities with a cadence of 720 s. The spatial resolution of the
instrument is 1 arcsec with the pixel size of 0.5×0.5 arcsec2. A special algorithm
is used (Turmon et al., 2010) to automatically identify and crop ARs patch from
the full-disk magnetograms. The patches of ARs are provided as Space-Weather
Active Region Patches (SHARPs Bobra et al., 2014; Hoeksema et al., 2014) that
include maps of magnetic ﬁeld strength, Bf , inclination, Bi, and azimuth, Ba.
To minimize the inﬂuence of the projection eﬀect we tracked ARs as long as
they were located within ±35 degrees of the central meridian (corresponding to a
four-day time interval, which are shown in the 3rd column of Table 1). Assigning

The averaged total unsigned ﬂux, hΦi, that an AR exhibited during the

analyzed period is shown in the 5th column of Table 1.

Flare activity of the ARs was evaluated using the 1–8 ˚A X-ray ﬂux mea-
surements acquired by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-15
(GOES-15, the data are available at https://satdat.ngdc.noaa.gov/sem/goes/data/full/).
We also used images of the Sun acquired at the 1600 ˚A spectral line by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board SDO (SDO/AIA, Lemen et al., 2012),
to analyze the structure and dynamics of the associated ﬂares.

3. Local and Distributed Electric Currents

One way to derive the magnitude of electric current density jz within an AR is
to use the diﬀerential form of Ampere’s law to compute a local electric current
map, i.e.:

jz =

1
µ0 (cid:18)

∂By
∂x

−

∂Bx
∂y (cid:19)

,

(2)

where µ0 is the magnetic constant, and By and Bx are components of the
transverse magnetic ﬁeld Bt. It is worth noting that due to shortcomings of
magnetographic instrumentation this approach may not be well suitable for de-
riving electric current density (Parker, 1996). Moreover, Fleishman and Pevtsov
(2018) argued that the use of partial derivatives may lead to enhancement of
errors of calculations.

In this work we used the integral form of the Ampere’s law to compute the

electric current density at each pixel of a magnetogram:

SOLA: ms6_arxiv.tex; 17 December 2019; 1:51; p. 6

where the integration is performed over a small closed contour L enclosing an
area s where the vertical electric current density is to be calculated. Our previous
study (Fursyak, 2018) showed that the contour size of 5×5 pixels is the best
compromise between the noise level and loss of information due to smoothing
by the integration. Thus, larger contours produce less intense and wide current
structures whereas a smaller contour produces no visible improvement compared
to the outcome of the diﬀerential formula. When using the 5×5 pixel contour, the
width of peaks remains the same and the noise level is much lower than that of
the diﬀerential method. That is because to calculate the electric current density
at the central pixel, the integral method uses 16 nodal points (for L=5×5 pixels)
versus only 9 points are used in the diﬀerential method. Moreover, integration
is performed using the Simpson formula to enhance the calculation accuracy.
The large-scale distributed currents were then derived by summing the current
density inside the area of interest.

Note, that the Ampere’s law was used for investigation of neutralized currents
as means of computing large-scale currents, distributed over an area covering
magnetic ﬁeld of one polarity (Wilkinson et al., 1992; Georgoulis, Titov and
Miki´c, 2012; Kontogiannis et al., 2017). An integration of the transverse mag-
netic ﬁeld along a vast contour was applied. To derive the current densities in
nodal points of a magnetogram, this method was applied for the ﬁrst time by
Abramenko and Gopasyuk (1987) and Abramenko, Gopasyuk and Ogir (1988).
Here we continue this way to utilize the Ampere’s law.

Typical distributions of local vertical electric currents in ARs are shown in
Figure 1. For each magnetogram acquired during the analyzed period we cal-
culated the unsigned total vertical current, Itot, as a sum of absolute values of
the current density multiplied by the pixel area. The averaged over time Itot are
presented in the 6th column of the Table 1. We can see that the magnitudes are
nearly similar (except for the strongest AR 12192), suggesting that the ﬂare-quiet
and ﬂare-productive ARs do not signiﬁcantly diﬀer.

We also calculated the imbalance of the local currents and the magnetic ﬂux
(their time-averaged values are listed in the last two columns of Table 1). We
used the commonly accepted formula for the imbalance (Abramenko, Wang and
Yurchishin, 1996):

S+ |jz(i, j)| −
S+ |jz(i, j)| +

S− |jz(i, j)|
S− |jz(i, j)|

× 100%,

(4)

ρjz =

P
P

P
P

where jz(i, j) is electric current density at pixel (i, j), S+ (S−) denotes a set of
pixels with jz(i, j) > 0 (jz(i, j) < 0).

Using the same approach we also calculated the imbalance of the vertical
component of the magnetic ﬁeld, ρBz (last column in Table 1). The numerator in
Equation (4) gives us the net current over a magnetogram, and its time-averaged
magnitude < Inet > is also presented in the 7th column of Table 1.

(c), 12158 (d), 12371 (e), and 12192 (f) derived from the transversal magnetic ﬁeld data by
equation 3. The maps are scaled from -0.02 A m−2 (black) to 0.02 A m−2 (white).

Comparison of the last two columns of Table 1 demonstrates that, for all ARs,
the current imbalance is very low (it does not exceed 0.1% percent), whereas
the ﬂux imbalance can be quite strong. This implies that the vertical electric
currents are closing within an AR, whereas signiﬁcant fraction of the magnetic
ﬂux of an AR may close elsewhere outside the AR. This is a common situation
especially during the solar maximum since UV images often show large-scale
loops connecting various ARs or an AR and a quiet Sun area. Moreover, this
also means that electric currents do not always ﬂow along the magnetic ﬁeld lines,
i.e., the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld is not a force-free ﬁeld and/or a substantial
part of the magnetic ﬂux is nearly potential and leaves the AR.

Structured local electric currents and elongated current ribbons of both signs
could be seen in the current distribution maps in Figure 1. If the surface-
distributed current does exist, it is not readily visible in these maps. To reveal it
we used a method introduced and tested in Abramenko and Gopasyuk (1987). A
distributed vertical electric current can manifest itself as a regular deviation from
potentiality, i.e., as an organized vortex-like azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore,
one may detect distributed electric currents by analyzing the deviation of the
observed magnetic ﬁeld lines from the corresponding potential conﬁguration.

We thus performed the following procedure. For each vector magnetogram,
we calculated a potential magnetic ﬁeld based on the observed Bz component
by IDL CFF1N code (Sakurai, 1982). At each pixel of the magnetogram, the

observed transverse magnetic ﬁeld vector (Bt) was decomposed into two com-
ponents: a component parallel to the transverse potential magnetic ﬁeld and
a component, Bt⊥, that is perpendicular to the transverse potential magnetic
ﬁeld. The latter is generated by vertical electric currents. We will refer to Bt⊥
as a non-potential component of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld (Figure 2, green
arrows).

Figure 2 shows that a vortex-like structure can be detected in each AR. Some
of them are very well pronounced (especially those around the main spot),
whereas others, spread over the following part of an AR (except NOAA AR
12192), demonstrate only a hint of a vortex-like structure with an opposite sense
of twist. The most complex AR 12192 (Figure 2f) displays at least three vortex-
like structures with the strongest one associated with the strongest negative
polarity spot. Note, that these vortexes are not exclusively connected to any
particular magnetic polarity, but may cover an extended area encompassing both
polarities, see Figure 2d, f.

We speculate that an observed vortex is associated with a large-scale dis-
tributed vertical electric current, which must close, in a loop-like manner, through
the chromosphere and the corona back to the photosphere, because the vertical
electric currents are very well balanced (see Table 1, column 9).

We thus possibly deal with a global electric current system of an AR, and to
evaluate the magnitude of this current, we need to integrate current densities
inside the area of the most coherent and strong vortex. In case of bipolar ARs,
the current seems to be closed predominantly over the vast following part: the
hints of opposite vortexes observed there support the suggestion. In a case of
very complex multipolar magnetic conﬁgurations (such as AR NOAA 12192),
several of such global current systems might coexist in one AR.

To this end, to calculate the magnitude of the distributed electric current, we
have to focus on a best-pronounced and strongest vortex of Bt⊥. We calculate
the magnitude of distributed electric current as follows:

Idistr =

jzds,

ZS

(5)

where S is an area enclosed by a contour C (note that the electric current
densities in Equation (5) are taken with their sign). This contour was manually
deﬁned such that the Bt⊥ arrows are oppositely directed on both sides of the
contour outline. The contour was deﬁned on the ﬁrst magnetogram, the shape
of the contour was kept the same during the observational interval and the
location of the contour was ﬁxed relative to the center of gravity of the sunspot.
The center of gravity was measured in magnetograms, the contour of the main
sunspot was determined as a level of ± 1000 Gauss in the vertical magnetic ﬁeld
component Bz. The summing (5) was performed over all pixels located inside
the contour C, regardless of the polarity of Bz. Note that the vertical magnetic
ﬁeld component does not pertain directly to calculations of Idistr, only indirectly
through the determination of the contour C (as a boundary condition for the
potential ﬁeld calculations). At the same time, one can notice (see Figure 2) that
small places of opposite (relative to the main spot) polarity inside the contour
are co-spatial with local disturbances of the coherent Bt⊥-vortex. We consider
appearance/disappearance of such disturbances as a signature of evolutional
changes in the distributed current.

The sign of Idistr is positive when the resulting current is directed toward the
observer and negative in the opposite case. The time-averaged Idistr for each
AR are presented in the 8th column of Table 1. Data in this table show that
for all ARs the net current over a magnetogram, Inet, is weaker than the net
current inside a contour, Idistr. This implies that the outlining a speciﬁc contour
to detect the global structure with prevailing current really makes sense.

The direction of the distributed electric current can also be derived from the
direction of the vortex structure of the non-potential transverse magnetic ﬁeld:
a distributed electric current directed toward the observer is associated with
predominantly counterclockwise direction of Bt⊥.

We can estimate the sign of magnetic twist, α, from the well-known relation-
ship: jz = αBz. In general, the direction of twist is related to magnetic helicity of
a magnetic ﬂux system. A number of various mechanisms is presumably responsi-
ble for helicity generation within a magnetic ﬂux tube (Coriolis eﬀect, diﬀerential
rotation, turbulent plasma motions to mention a few). Most of these mechanisms
are antisymmetric with respect to the solar equator, therefore the twist of ARs

Distributed Electric Currents in Solar ARs

in diﬀerent hemispheres should have opposite signs. This inference, known as
the hemispheric helicity sign rule, was observationally conﬁrmed in a number of
works (e.g., Seehafer, 1990; Pevtsov, Canﬁeld, and Metcalf, 1994; Abramenko,
Wang and Yurchishin, 1996, see also a review by Pevtsov et al., 2014). ARs
obeying the hemispheric rule should have counterclockwise (clockwise) direction
of the Bt⊥ arrows in the leading (following) parts regardless of the hemisphere
where they are located.

For ARs 12381 and 12674, located in the northern hemisphere, the Bz of the
leading spot is negative, therefore, magnetic twist, α, is also negative in accor-
dance with the hemispherical helicity rule. The upward (positive) distributed
current in the leading part is in accordance with the relationship jz = αBz.

For NOAA AR 12494 located in the southern hemisphere, we observed a
positive polarity leading sunspot and a positive eﬀective magnetic twist, as is
expected for an AR in the southern hemisphere according to the hemispherical
helicity rule. Accordingly, we observed the upward distributed current in the
leading part of the AR.

The situation is more diverse for ﬂaring ARs. Thus, in the case of NOAA
AR 12371, which is a bipolar AR and obeys both the Hale-polarity law and
the hemispheric helicity rule, the entire picture is similar to that for the ﬂare-
quiet ARs with one exception: the magnitude of the distributed current is much
higher, see the 8th column in Table 1.

NOAA AR 12158 was located in the northern hemisphere, however, contrary
to Hale polarity law, it had a positive polarity leading spot. The distributed
current over this positive polarity leading part turned out to be negative, which
resulted in the negative helicity α, which means that the AR obeyed the hemi-
spheric helicity rule. Indeed, the corresponding EUV images indicated the overall
counter-clockwise twist of coronal loops around the leading spot.

For NOAA AR 12192, we found an upward distributed electric current around
the main following spot, which implies that this AR does not obey the hemi-
spheric helicity rule. This peculiar and the largest AR of solar cycle 24 (Sheeley
and Wang, 2015) is discussed in detail in the next section.

The most interesting inference that follows from Table 1 is that the magnitude
of the distributed current found in the ﬂaring ARs signiﬁcantly exceeds that of
the ﬂare-quiet ARs. This fact motivated us to further explore time variations
of the distributed current and compare them to the activity time lines of these
ARs.

4. Temporal Variations of the Distributed Current in ARs of

Diﬀerent Flare Activity

We will study time variations of the distributed electric current, Idist, inside the
contours marked in Figure 2. The time variations of the distributed electric cur-
rent in ﬂare-quiet ARs, along with other AR parameters are shown in Figure 3,
while those for ﬂaring ARs are presented in Figure 4. We found that the largest
errors in calculations of Idistr come from possible variations in the manually-
derived contour C. For each AR, several contours were applied, and the largest

Yu.A. Fursyak et al.

deviation in Idistr was adopted as an error bar. The error bars for each third
magnetogram of NOAA AR 12674 are shown in the top panel of Figure 3, along
with the highest (during a 4-day interval) error bar, which is marked as a solid
bar. For the rest of ARs, only the highest error bar is shown in each panel of
Figures 3, 4.

We found that in all ARs the dominant orientation of the Bt⊥ vortex (coun-
terclockwise or clockwise) was largely preserved during the observed period.
However, the magnitude of the distributed current was changing with time.
Thus, ﬂare-quiet ARs (see Figure 3, red curves), show a rather low magnitude of
Idistr (in a range of ±20 × 1012 A), and the sign of Idistr can change as well. This
behavior may be explained by intrusion of new strong small-scale local electric
currents into the vortex area driven by sudden appearance/disappearance of
magnetic features.

Flaring ARs show much higher level of Idistr (up to 80 × 1012 A), so that the
possible disturbances by small-scale current features do not aﬀect the sign of
Idistr and time variations of the Idistr magnitude are very gradual. For two ARs
(12158 and 12192), we observed slight enhancements of the distributed current,
which were co-temporal with periods of enhanced ﬂaring.

We did not ﬁnd any one-to-one correspondence in time variations between
the total unsigned current Itot and the distributed current Idistr. This is not
surprising because Idistr constitutes only a tiny part (of about one thousandth) of
Itot (see Table 1 and Figures 3, 4). Nevertheless, energy stored in the distributed
current system of about (5 − 80)× 1012 A is about 1032 − 1033 erg, which is
comparable with energy released in any solar ﬂare. The energy magnitude was
estimated following Abramenko and Gopasyuk (1987): an azimuthal ﬁeld Bφ(r)
of the electric current I uniformly distributed over the cross-section of a cylinder
of radius a can be presented as Bφ(r) = (2I/ca2)/r. Here r is a distance from
the cylinder center (0 < r < a) and c is the speed of light. An integration of
B2
φ(r)/(8π) over the volume occupied by the current loop of typical length 1010
cm and typical radius 5 × 109 cm gives us the estimation of distributed electric
current energy.

The strongest (in sense of the total magnetic ﬂux and the ﬂaring index) NOAA
AR 12192 deserves more attention as this AR seemed to host two large-scale
distributed current systems.

We thus speculate that the ﬁrst distributed electric current system appeared
to connect the leading positive polarity sunspot with several small sunspots of
negative polarity located in the northern part of the AR. The direction of that
distributed electric current obeyed the hemispheric helicity rule. The second and
prevailing distributed electric current system could have connected the mature
following negative polarity sunspot with a vast positive polarity region located
to the south-west (the region is inside the ﬁeld-of-view, see Figure 2f, and, there-
fore, it was included in our calculation of the electric current imbalance). This
assumption is supported by data in Figure 5 showing ﬂare ribbons connecting
the two discussed regions. Flare ribbons are usually associated with eruption of
a large scale twisted current carrying structure as inferred from data analysis by
Sun et al. (2015), as well as from numerical simulations by Jiang et al. (2016).

Distributed Electric Currents in Solar ARs

We analyzed time variations of the second (prevailing) distributed electric
current system in NOAA AR 12192 associated with the mature following sunspot
(Figure 2f). Our choice was dictated by two facts. First, the transverse ﬁeld vor-
tex was more pronounced (in sense of stronger transversal ﬁeld) in this part of the
AR allowing us to more accurately deﬁne the boundary contour C. Second reason
is that at least one ﬂare brightening associated with strong ﬂares in this AR was
located in the vicinity of the following sunspot. The current time proﬁle shows
that the magnitude of the distributed current in NOAA AR 12192 is noticeably
higher than those found in other ﬂaring ARs under study (Figure 4). Note, that
NOAA AR 12192 also displayed the highest ﬂare index (see Table 1, column
4). Variations of the distributed electric current are also more pronounced than
those for other ARs. Thus we clearly observe that periods of enhanced ﬂaring
(M- and X-class ﬂares) are nearly co-temporal with the high level of distributed
electric current.

It should be noted that the magnitude of distributed electric current as well
as its temporal behavior only slightly depended on the shape of the boundary
contour C. In Figure 6 we show a set of diﬀerent contours that were used to
calculate Idistr and the corresponding temporal variations of Idistr are shown
in the right panel of Figure 6. One can see that all time curves exhibit similar
behavior and amplitudes.

5. Concluding Remarks and Discussion

Using SDO/HMI magnetic ﬁeld data for six ARs, we studied large scale organi-
zation of vertical electric currents. Our ﬁndings are as follows.

1. In all cases the imbalance ρjz of local vertical currents over the entire mag-
netogram was found to be very low (from 0.02 to 0.1%) and it remained
persistently low during the entire studied time interval (4 days). At the same
time, imbalance of the vertical magnetic ﬁeld was much higher (up to 14%).
This ﬁnding implies that, ﬁrst, vertical electric currents are closed inside the
AR and, second, the magnetic ﬁeld and electric currents do not always follow
each other, so that the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld either is not a force-free
ﬁeld, or a part of the magnetic ﬂux is potential and leaves an AR.
The highly fragmented structure of the local currents allowed us to suggest
that the bulk of the current is closed within low lying loops. This suggestion
is supported by NLFFF modeling of magnetic ﬁeld and currents above an AR
10930 (Schrijver et al., 2008, see Fig. 3 in this paper). Numerical simulations
(Georgoulis, Titov and Miki´c, 2012; Janvier et al., 2014; Dalmasse et al.,
2015, to mention a few) showed that places with signiﬁcant shear and strong
magnetic polarity inversion line are particularly associated with strong local
electric currents, that seem to be closed in short low-lying magnetic loops.
Using data-driven numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling, Jiang
et al. (2016) found that in the AR of our interest NOAA AR 12192, the
essential electric currents are concentrated below ≈20 Mm (see Fig. 2 in Jiang
et al., 2016). A logical consequence of this result is that the electric current

Figure 6. Left – LOS magnetogram and the vector of the non-potential component of the
transversal magnetic ﬁeld Bt⊥ (green arrows) of the following polarity of NOAA AR 12912.
Colored curves show diﬀerent manually chosen contours C to calculate the distributed electric
current magnitude. Right – Time variations of the distributed electric current magnitude are
shown by colored thick curves. The color of each curve denotes the contour that was used to
calculate the magnitude of distributed electric current by equation 5. GOES-15 X-ray ﬂux is
shown by black curve. The strongest ﬂares occurred in NOAA AR 12192 are marked.

density decreases with height, so that high loops (including those closing
outside the AR and carrying out magnetic ﬂux) are nearly potential. This
is supported by Abramenko and Yurchishin (1997), and by Schrijver (2016)
studies, who compared potential ﬁeld conﬁguration with observed EUV loops
for an extended sample of ARs.
Final and the most important inference of this study is that an electric current
system of any scale is closing within an AR.
There are only few studies of the electric currents imbalance over an entire
AR. Thus, Abramenko, Wang and Yurchishin (1996) analyzed 40 ARs using
Huairou Solar Observing Station (HSOS) data and found that the imbalance
of the vertical electric current is low (maximal imbalance of 3.5% and it was
lower than 1% for 26 ARs). Schrijver et al. (2008) reported the electric current
imbalance of NOAA AR 10930 to be 0.7%, while Georgoulis, Titov and Miki´c
(2012) reported 6.3% imbalance for NOAA AR 10940, which is four times
lower than the magnetic ﬂux imbalance.

Distributed Electric Currents in Solar ARs

Thus, the present study further supports the earlier ﬁnding that the vertical
electric currents in ARs are very well balanced.

2. Structures of electric currents of diﬀerent spatial scales co-exist within an AR.
Along with local currents, we found an active region-scale distributed current
Idistr associated with large-scale coherent vortexes of the non-potential com-
ponent Bt⊥ of the observed transverse magnetic ﬁeld. The leading part of an
AR is usually occupied by the upwardly directed distributed current, which
closes down to the photosphere through the chromosphere and the corona
over a vast area of the following part of the AR.
Note that the Bt⊥-vortex (over the leading or following part of an AR) covers
a large area that encompasses magnetic elements of both polarities. This is
essentially diﬀerent from the neutralized current investigations.

3. The magnitude of the distributed electric current in an AR diﬀers depending
on the level of ﬂare activity. Thus, low-ﬂaring ARs exhibit small variations
of the magnitude of the current system in the range of ±20 × 1012 A while
ARs with high level of ﬂaring show signiﬁcant variations of the distributed
electric current in the range of 30 − 95 × 1012 A. Qualitatively, this inference is
in a good agreement with the earlier ﬁndings on the non-neutralized electric
currents (Kontogiannis et al., 2017), however, there should be some caution
in the interpretation. Non-neutralized electric currents are associated with
the Lorentz force in the vicinity of polarity inversion lines (Georgoulis, Titov
and Miki´c, 2012) and thus emphasize local concentrations of electric currents
closing in relatively low loops. In the present study, global electric current
systems are investigated, which are, in principle, not associated with the
polarity inversion lines and seem to penetrate in the corona. An association
between these current systems is a subject of future investigations.
When compared to the total unsigned electric current in an AR, the magni-
tude of the distributed current is rather small, less than one percent of the
total current. However, energy stored in the distributed electric current of
(5 − 80) × 1012 A found in a typical AR is about 1032 − 1033 erg, which is
comparable with energy of any solar ﬂare.

4. We also found that periods of high level of the distributed electric currents

are nearly co-temporal with enhanced ﬂaring in an AR.
The magnitude of the distributed currents varies rather gradually with a
characteristic time-scale of several days, which agrees with Melrose (1991)
and Wheatland (2000) who argued that an AR-scale current system is rooted
deeply in the convection zone, and “the long inductive time associated with
such an extended current system precludes changes on the short time scale of
a ﬂare, and so currents will be conserved during a ﬂare (Wheatland, 2000). In
this sense, our inferences are in agreement with the so-called [E-J] paradigm,
which considers magnetic loops as deeply rooted electric circuits (Melrose,
1995), on the contrary to the [B-u] paradigm (Parker 1996) based on the
magnetohydrodynamical description of the magnetic ﬁeld B and velocity
ﬁeld u (see Georgoulis, 2018). This long-standing dichotomy between the
interpretations, where the non-neutralization of electric currents plays a key
role, seems to be far from a solution, however, recent results reported by Geor-
goulis, Titov and Miki´c (2012) and Georgoulis (2018) provided solid criteria
and physical reasons for observed non-neutralization of electric currents.

Results presented here are based on data from six ARs. Although the most
representative types of ARs were analyzed further investigation involving larger
statistics is necessary in order to understand the role of the large-scale global
current systems in AR stability and ﬂaring.
