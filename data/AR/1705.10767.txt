Abstract

A ﬁve-dimensional treatment of the Boltzmann equation is used to establish the
constitutive equations that relate thermodynamic ﬂuxes and forces up to ﬁrst order
in the gradients for simple charged ﬂuids in the presence of electromagnetic ﬁelds.
The formalism uses the ansatz ﬁrst introduced by Kaluza back in 1921, propos-
ing that the particle charge-mass ratio is proportional to the ﬁfth component of its
velocity ﬁeld. It is shown that in this approach, space-time curvature yields ther-
modynamic forces leading to generalizations of the well-known cross-eﬀects present
in linear irreversible thermodynamics.

Introduction

According to the tenets of general relativity, classical ﬁelds can be considered conse-
quences of space-time curvature produced by sources such as mass and electric charge.
In the case of gravitational ﬁelds, Einstein’s equations show that the Newtonian poten-
tial can be interpreted as a metric coeﬃcient, which in turn determines the geodesics
that structureless particles follow in physical situations such as planetary orbits. In the
same spirit, electromagnetic potentials can generate similar eﬀects curving space-time
so that the trajectories of charged particles correspond to geodesics in a 5D space-time.
In Kaluza’s approach [1], the charge-mass ratio acts as the ﬁfth component of the
mξ where q is the charge, m is the mass and ξ =
16πGǫ0/c2 is the coupling constant. The fundamental constants G, ǫ0 and c have

particle’s velocity ﬁeld; i.e. V 5 = q

their usual meanings. Kaluza also proposed the cylindrical condition:

∂
∂x5 = 0
which leads to the sourceless Maxwell equations and is compatible with the concept of
periodic, compact extra dimensions [1, 2]. In this work the capital latin letters run for 1
to 5, the Greek indices will indicate values from 1 to 4, lowercase latin indices will run
from 1 to 3 and the dot corresponds to total proper time (arc length) derivatives.
In Kaluza’s formalism, the charged particles follow geodesics given by

˙V µ = V AV µ

;A = V α ∂V µ

∂xα + Γµ

5BV BV 5 = 0

where Γµ

where F µ
λ is the usual electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor. Equation (2) corresponds to the equa-
tion of motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic ﬁeld. Maxwell’s equations can
be derived from Kaluza’s ansatz and the tenets of general relativity. The connection be-
tween the electromagnetic force and the 5D geometry is given through Eq. (5). Following
the standard approach, the potentials included in Eq. (4) are here treated as perturba-
tions of a ﬂat space-time. All the second order terms in the calculations regarding these
quantities will be assumed to be negligible.
This 5D approach was ﬁrst introduced to the phenomenological study of charged ﬂuids
within the framework of irreversible thermodynamics in Ref.
[3]. On the other hand,
the foundations of the corresponding microscopic theory were only recently established
in Ref.
[8]. The present work revisits these ideas, including magnetic ﬁelds in a fully
covariant fashion with the explicit introduction of the spatial projector which separates
space and time components. This formalism, in which the ﬁeld eﬀects are consequences
of the space-time curvature, is then used in order to obtain the heat ﬂux and the electric
current, consistently predicting the corresponding eﬀects related to transport processes
in simple charged ﬂuids.

2

To accomplish this task, we have divided the paper as follows, in Section 2 we
establish the conservation laws using the Boltzmann equation in Kaluza’s space-time.
The distribution function for the dissipative case to ﬁrst order in the local gradients is
obtained in Section 3 while the electromagnetic ﬁeld contributions for the heat ﬂux and
current density are established in Section 4. A brief discussion of the results and ﬁnal
remarks are included in the last section.

2 Boltzmann equation

The Boltzmann equation for a simple dilute gas in the Kaluza space-time is expressed
as

V Af,A + ˙V A ∂f

′

∂V A = J(f, f

),

(6)

In Eq. (6) J(f, f
molecular ﬁve-velocity of a single particle, namely

) is the collisional kernel, f is the distribution function and V A is the

V A = 

where vℓ is three-velocity and γ(v) is the usual Lorentz factor for the molecular velocity.
In order to obtain the balance equations, we multiply Eq. (6) by the collisional invariant
mV B and integrate in velocity space [4]. The conservation equations can be expressed
in terms of the particle and energy-momentum as follows (see the Appendix)

tion of T 5µ from Eq. (13) in Eq. (9) leads to the continuity equation namely,

(cid:18)

˙n + nθ = 0

(14)

where we have deﬁned the total derivative as ˙n = U An,A and θ = U A
;A. Notice that
due to the cylindrical condition given by Eq. (1), the particle conservation equation is
identical to the one obtained in the four dimensional formalism.

The internal energy balance follows from projecting Eq. (8) in the direction of the

hydrodynamic four-velocity, which leads to [6]

n ˙ε + pθ = 0

(15)

On the other hand, Euler’s equation for the evolution of the hydrodynamic four-velocity
is obtained by explicitly calculating the covariant derivative of the energy-momentum
tensor, which yields [6]

˜ρ ˙U ν + hναp,α = −2Γν

α5T 5α

(16)

The Christoﬀel symbol included in Eq. (16) is easily identiﬁed with the electromagnetic
ﬁeld tensor in accordance to Eq. (5), so that the well known relativistic hydrodynamic
momentum balance equation in the Euler regime is recovered:

˜ρ ˙U ν + hναp,α = nqF ν

λ U λ

(17)

where ˜ρ is given by

nε
c2 +
The right hand side of Eq. (17) corresponds to the Lorentz force which can be thus
viewed as an eﬀect of space-time curvature. We are now in position to analyze the
dissipative eﬀects up to ﬁrst order in the gradients.

3 Navier-Stokes regime

Dissipative eﬀects, which deviate the distribution function from its local equilibrium
value, can be introduced through the Chapman-Enskog expansion [7] namely,

f = f (0) + µf (1) + µ2f (2) + . . .

(19)

where the parameter µ is the Knudsen number.
For the sake of simplicity, the right hand side of the Boltzmann equation is here modeled
using a relaxation approximation as follows

J(f, f

f − f (0)

(20)

Use of the cylindrical condition (1) and the metric (4) in the standard treatment of the

It is important to notice that the last term of Eq. (21) vanishes since particles move

The index β in Eq. (22) appears instead of B in Eq. (21) since f (0) is independent of
the electric charge. The ﬁrst two terms of Eq. (22) have been already discussed in the
literature of relativistic ﬂuids and lead to the coupling of the dissipative ﬂuxes with the
temperature and density gradients [9]. Here we focus our attention in the last term,
which contains the electromagnetic ﬁeld and can be written as

where the second term after the last equality vanishes since it contains the contraction
of a symmetric and an antisymmetric tensor. Also, for the remaining term in Eq. (23)
it is convenient to separate space and time components using Eckart’s decomposition as
follows

to the coupling of the non-equilibrium distribution function with the gradient of the

which is similar to the corresponding expression established in Ref. [12] by using special
relativistic arguments. However, in the present case the contribution does not vanish in
the low temperature limit and thus Eq. (26) can be used to calculate the current density
in such regime. This will be addressed in the next section.

4 Electric current and heat ﬂux

In order to obtain an expression for the electric current, the ﬁrst order correction to the
distribution function due to the electromagnetic ﬁeld given in Eq. (26) is introduced in
the deﬁnition (11):

where use has been made of the fact that ˜ρ = nmG
. Notice that
in the electrostatic case J ℓ = σEℓ where σ is easily identifed as the electrical conductiv-
ity, which in the non-relativistic case is given by σ = nq2
m τc. This expression is similar to
its non-relativistic counterpart, obtained using the stationary state approximation [14].
It is important to emphasize at this point that the relation between the electrical current
and the electromagnetic ﬁeld cannot be directly established following standard kinetic
theory without neglecting the partial time derivative term in Boltzmann’s equation or
introducing similar assumptions. The result in Eq. (28), which is the electromagnetic
generalization of the one obtained in Ref. [8], shows that the introduction of the electro-
magnetic potential in the space-time geometry allows for Ohm’s law to be established
from microscopic grounds without such assumptions. Moreover, the dependence of the
corresponding conductivity with the temperature, here given through the relaxation time
τc, is consistent with the theoretical predictions which have been thoroughly veriﬁed.

5 Final Remarks

Equations (28) and (30) are the main results of this work. It is important to notice that
both expressions arise from the contribution of the ﬂuid as a whole, through the intro-
duction of Euler’s equation in the expression for f (1), as part of the Chapman-Enskog
procedure. This contribution, associated with the bulk, is not present in the stationary
state approach since the partial time derivative term of the equilibrium distribution func-
tion is neglected. Space-time curvature is identiﬁed as the source driving the dissipative
ﬂuxes through the covariant derivatives present in Kaluza’s-type approach.

The present formalism predicts stronger thermoelectric and thermomagnetic eﬀects
than the ones obtained in the special relativistic approach (see Eq. (32) in [15] and Eq.
(43) in [12]). Indeed the coeﬃcient here obtained is independent of the speed of light in
the low temperature limit. These eﬀects are measurable at low temperatures (z ≪ 1)

7

and are described in the theory of free electrons in solid state physics text books within
the stationary state approximation [13, 14]. Also, the fact that Ohm’s law is recovered
constitutes an improvement with respect to the 4-dimensional formalism. The present
paper generalizes such result, already established for the electrostatic case in Ref.
[8],
to the electromagnetic case in an arbitrary reference frame.
Future work includes the establishment of the complete set of transport equations in-
cluding the general force-ﬂux relations in the dynamics of the charged ﬂuid. The stability
analysis of such equations under linear perturbations in the state variables and the es-
tablishment of the corresponding entropy production for the simple charged ﬂuid in a
curved space-time are also important problems to be addressed. The present formalism
will also be generalized to a binary mixture in order to obtain the contribution to the
cross-eﬀects and the corresponding reciprocity relations. The approach here presented
is promising and could lead to the identiﬁcation of unnoticed general relativistic-type
eﬀects in the physics of charged ﬂuids.
