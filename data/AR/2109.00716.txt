Abstract 

Phase-change materials serve a broad field of applications ranging from non-volatile electronic memory to 

optical  data  storage  by  providing  reversible,  repeatable,  and  rapid  switching  between  amorphous  and 

crystalline states accompanied by large changes in the electrical and optical properties. Here, we demonstrate 

how  ion  irradiation  can  be  used  to  tailor  disorder  in  initially  crystalline  Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST)  thin  films  via  the 

intentional creation of lattice defects. We found that continuous Ar+-ion irradiation at room temperature of 

GST films causes complete amorphization of GST when exceeding 0.6 (for rock-salt GST) and 3 (for hexagonal 

GST)  displacements  per  atom  (ndpa).  While  the  transition  from  rock-salt  to  amorphous  GST  is  caused  by 

progressive amorphization via the accumulation of lattice defects, several transitions occur in hexagonal GST 

upon  ion  irradiation.  In  hexagonal  GST,  the  creation  of  point  defects  and  small  defect  clusters  leads  to 

disordering  of  intrinsic  vacancy  layers  (van  der  Waals  gaps)  that  drives  the  electronic  metal–insulator 

transition. Increasing disorder then induces a structural transition from hexagonal to rock-salt and then leads 

to  amorphization.  Furthermore,  we  observed  different  annealing  behavior  of  defects  for  rock-salt  and 

hexagonal GST. The higher amorphization threshold in hexagonal GST compared to rock-salt GST is caused 

by an increased defect-annealing rate, i.e., a higher resistance against ion-beam-induced disorder. Moreover, 

we observed that the recovery of defects in GST is on the time scale of seconds or less at room temperature.

I. INTRODUCTION 

At least theoretically, almost any material can be solidified into at least two distinct states—a disordered 

amorphous state and an ordered crystalline state. Thus, phase transitions between amorphous and crystalline 

states may occur for numerous materials. The class of phase-change materials (PCMs), however, is unique in 

that the phase transition at elevated temperatures can be exceptionally fast, and both phases are (meta)stable 

at ambient conditions1. Furthermore, in most PCMs, the structural transitions are accompanied by electronic 

transitions, which result in distinct electrical and optical properties between various phases, facilitating their 

uses in non-volatile electronic memory and optical data storage1–7. The most extensively studied PCMs are 

pseudo-binary GeTe–Sb2Te3 chalcogenide compounds, particularly Ge2Sb2Te5, which provides high switching 

speed  and  material  stability.  Ge2Sb2Te5  crystallizes  into  a  metastable  rock-salt-like  structure  and  a  stable 

hexagonal structure8. The rock-salt structure comprises face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cells, with octahedrally 

coordinated Te atoms occupying the anion-like fcc sublattice and randomly distributed Ge, Sb, and intrinsic 

vacancies  occupying  the  cation-like  lattice  sites9,10.  Ordering  the  randomly  distributed  vacancies  (when 

sufficient energy is provided) drives an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) caused by the formation of highly 

ordered vacancy layers within the stable hexagonal phase11–14. While the exact atomic arrangement in the 

hexagonal  unit  cell  is  still  a  matter  of  debate,  cubic  close-packed  stacking  (abcabc)  with  a  nine-plane 

periodicity comprising pure Te and mixed Ge/Sb basal planes along the c-axis is proposed11–13,15. There is a 

large separation between two adjacent Te layers corroborated by a significantly larger bond length (~ 3.7 °A) 

compared to the Ge/Sb-Te bond lengths (~ 3 °A). This ordered vacancy layer is accompanied by weak van der 

Waals  forces  between  low  (3)  coordinated  Te  atoms  (this  is  referred  to  as  a  van  der  Waals  gap).  It  is 

understood  that  the  van  der  Waals  gaps  are  responsible  for  metal-like  conduction  within  hexagonal  GST 

(which behaves as a degenerate p-type semiconductor16). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the IMT is 

purely driven by disorder-induced (Anderson) localization17. Thus, the electrical and optical properties of GST 

strongly depend on the degree of disorder, which facilitates tuning these properties by controlling the amount 

of disorder within the material. Apart from thermal annealing17, a variety of approaches have emerged for 

tuning disorder in GST compounds. These include laser excitation18,19, focused electron beam irradiation20, 

tuning of chemical composition21,22, interface templates22–24, or the application of pressure25–30, strain31,32, 

and voltage pulses33–35. Ion irradiation facilitates precisely tailoring disorder in solids via nuclear collision 

cascades of the impinging ions; thus, multiple studies have investigated the effect of defect engineering of 

GST  compounds36–44.  While  these  studies  report  on  different  properties  examined  with  various  structural, 

2 

 
optical, or electrical techniques either during (in-situ) or after (ex-situ) ion bombardment, the comparison of 

the same material property obtained from in-situ and ex-situ measurements is missing. Performing both in-

situ  and  ex-situ  measurements  would  yield  insights  into  the  annealing  behavior  of  ion-irradiation-induced 

defects. 

Here,  we  demonstrate  a  combined  approach  of  in-situ  optical/electrical  and  ex-situ  optical/structural 

measurements  during  and  after  noble-gas  ion  irradiation  of  crystalline  (rock-salt  and  hexagonal)  GST  thin 

films.  We  reveal  how  ion  irradiation  drives  various  electronic  and  structural  transitions  towards  complete 

amorphization of GST thin films via the intentional creation of structural disorder. Furthermore, our approach 

allows  us  to  investigate  the  effect  of  in-situ  annealing  of  defects  during  ion  bombardment.  For  this,  we 

compare, first, the in-situ and ex-situ measurements and, second, the influence of the ion flux on the in-situ 

measurements.  

II. ION-BEAM-INDUCED DISORDER: IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS 

Figure 1 Simultaneous in-situ optical/electrical measurements of ~100-nm-thick GST films on SiO2/Si, initially in either 
the hexagonal or rock-salt phase: (a) Reflectance at λ = 635 nm versus ion fluence (Ni) of initially hexagonal and rock-
salt GST films upon Ar+-ion irradiation at a constant flux of 2 x 1011 cm-2s-1. The dashed orange line corresponds to the 
calculated  reflectance  value  of  a  comparable  amorphous  GST  film  (using  optical  data  from  reference45).  (b) 
Simultaneously obtained normalized resistance (R(Ni)/R(0)) for both phases with the ion fluence dependent resistance 
R(Ni)  and  the  resistance  before  irradiation  R(0).  To  account  for  the  different  intrinsic  resistances  of  rock-salt  and 

3 

 
 
hexagonal GST films, the resistance of the rock-salt sample was normalized to the saturated resistance value of the 
(amorphized, R(5 x 1014 cm-2)) hexagonal sample. 

We performed in-situ characterizations to investigate the effect of ion irradiation on the electrical and optical 

properties of GST films that were initially in rock-salt and hexagonal phases, respectively. For this purpose, 

magnetron-sputtered, annealed GST thin films with a thickness of approximately 100 nm on SiO2/Si substrates 

were  irradiated  with  Ar+-ions  at  room  temperature  while  the  samples’  optical  reflectivity  and  electrical 

resistance  were  simultaneously  and  continuously  monitored  (for  details  on  the  setup  see  supplementary 

material). The insulating (~300 nm thick) SiO2 barrier prevents current flow through the substrate. Note that 

Ar is not chemically incorporated into the GST matrix, which allows the investigation of the effects of induced 

lattice damage without simultaneous impurity doping. We used an ion energy of 180 keV to create a damage 

profile  that  is  almost  uniform  across  the  film  thickness.  Note,  that  we  use  different  ion  energies  for  the 

specific experiment depending on whether the ions penetrate through the film-substrate-interface (see also 

supplementary material): While the uniformity of the defect distribution for high ion energies is mandatory for 

the  electrical  measurements,  maintaining  a  pristine  interface  using  low  ion  energies  is  advantageous  for 

optical  spectroscopy  measurements.  The  ion  flux  was  set  to  2x1011  cm-2s-1,  which  does  not  result  in 

substantial thermal heating by the ion beam46. In Fig. 1a, we plotted the optical reflectance at λ = 635 nm of 

initially  rock-salt  and  hexagonal  GST  films  upon  ion  irradiation  as  a  function  of  ion  fluence.  To  enable 

comparison with experiments under different conditions (e.g., using different ion energy), we converted the 

ion  fluence  into  the  number  of  displacements  per  lattice  atom,  ndpa,  (gray  upper  axis,  see  supplementary 

material). Note, however, that ndpa is derived from Monte-Carlo TRIM simulations at absolute zero47, and defect 

migration and recombination reduce the residual amount of lattice displacements at elevated temperatures. 

Since the TRIM simulation returns a depth-dependent value for the number of displacements per incident ion, 

we use the maximum of this curve to derive ndpa. Further, because our in-situ experimental setup only detects 

changes of the optical reflectivity, the absolute reflectance values were calculated for the intrinsic films using 

the optical constants of the different GST phases45. The reflectance of both of the two GST films decreases 

upon ion bombardment and saturates when ndpa > 0.6 for the rock-salt phase and ndpa > 3 for the hexagonal 

phase, which agrees well with the amorphization thresholds obtained in similar experiments by Privitera et 

al.37. Upon saturation, the reflectance of both films is close to the calculated reflectance of an amorphous 

(as-deposited) GST film (for details on the calculation see supplementary material). 

Simultaneous  resistance  measurements  during  ion  bombardment  are  shown  in  figure  1b.  Here,  relative 

changes were compared instead of absolute values due to different contact geometries of each sample. To 
4 

 
account for the different intrinsic resistances of rock-salt and hexagonal GST films, the resistance change of 

the rock-salt sample was normalized to the saturated resistance value of the (amorphized) hexagonal sample, 

because  the  specific  resistance  in  the  amorphous  phase  should  be  similar  for  both  samples.  Thus,  the 

resulting  resistance  difference  of  intrinsic  hexagonal  and  rock-salt  GST  is  ~200,  in  good  agreement  with 

reported values17,48. The resistance increases upon ion irradiation by 4 (2) orders of magnitude and saturates 

for ndpa values above 1.2 (0.24) for the hexagonal phase (rock-salt phase). These ndpa saturation values are 

slightly lower than those for the optical data, which might indicate a slightly different impact of the amount of 

induced disorder in the film to the optical and electrical properties.  

III. TAILORING DISORDER: EX-SITU MEASUREMENTS 

We  further  gain  insights  into  the  various  structural  and  electronic  transitions  in  GST  that  occur  upon  ion 

bombardment  by  performing  optical  spectroscopy  and  X-ray  diffraction.  Here,  in  contrast  to  the  in-situ 

measurements from above, the measurements were carried out after certain irradiation steps with increasing 

ion fluence on separate samples. For these ex-situ measurements, multiple initially rock-salt and hexagonal 

GST thin films (d ≈ 100 nm) on Si were irradiated at room temperature with Ar+-ions at an angle of incidence 

of 7°, with various ion fluences. Optical and structural measurements were performed ex-situ on both GST 

phases minutes to hours after the ion irradiation. Here, we used an ion energy of 55 keV to avoid interface 

mixing (see supplementary material for more details). Inadvertent interface mixing for higher ion energies 

may reduce thin-film interference effects, which would hamper the comparability between different samples. 

Note that each ion fluence (or ndpa) corresponds to an individual sample; thus, sample-to-sample variations 

should be considered.

A. Disorder-induced progressive amorphization of rock-salt GST 

Figure 2 Ar irradiation of rock-salt GST films: (a) Reflectance in the visible (635 nm, green) and infrared (3 μm, red) as 
a function of displacements per lattice atom ndpa, fitted using Boltzmann’s sigmoidal equation (solid lines). (b) Extracted 
Gaussian peak area from XRD measurements of the r(200) reflection, normalized to the value of the intrinsic rock-salt 
GST film. Note, the dotted lines between data points are guides for the eye. 

The reflectance change as a function of ndpa at visible (635 nm) and near-IR (3 μm) wavelengths of rock-salt 

GST films on Si is given in figure 2a. In both cases, the reflectance remains almost unaffected by ion irradiation 

up to ndpa values of ~0.05. Small deviations can be attributed to sample-to-sample variations. In this low-ion-

fluence regime, mainly point defects, such as vacancies and interstitials, are formed, which do not seem to 

alter the optical properties of rock-salt GST. With further increasing ndpa, the reflectance drastically decreases 

in the visible and saturates at ndpa ~ 0.5, corresponding to complete amorphization of GST. In the near-IR (at 

3 µm), however, the effective amorphization threshold shifts to higher ndpa values. Note, that ndpa is used for 

normalization of the ion fluence and do not resemble different defect concentrations in different depths. A 

refractive index gradient is present within the GST film due to the non-uniform damage profile of 55 keV Ar+-

ions (see supplementary material). While visible light probes roughly the first half of the film, at 3 μm the 

extinction of GST is significantly smaller than in the visible45; thus, the reflected light contains information 

from the entire film and interface. The shift in amorphization threshold is therefore caused by the smaller 

amount of defects near the film/substrate interface.  

6 

 
 
We also performed XRD measurements on the same set of samples. Figure 2b shows the peak area of the 

r(200) reflection, which is indicative of the rock-salt structure, as a function of ndpa, where the peak area was 

extracted using a Gaussian function fitting (for details see supplementary material). Upon ion irradiation, there 

is a reduction in the intensity of the r(200) peak. Moreover, the inflection point of the r(200) peak is in between 

the inflection points of reflectance curves at visible and near-IR wavelengths. This corroborates the lower 

defect  concentration  near  the  GST/Si  interface  due  to  the  non-uniform  damage  profile,  because  the  XRD 

pattern also contains information about the entire film. We observed no further peaks in the XRD pattern upon 

ion  irradiation,  indicating  progressive  amorphization  of  the  GST  film  (see  supplementary  material).  This 

progressive amorphization likely proceeds by accumulation of point defects and small defect clusters or by 

direct amorphization of small regions within the GST film.  

B. Disorder-driven electronic and structural transitions in hexagonal GST 

Figure 3 Ar irradiation of hexagonal GST films: (a) Reflectance in the visible (635 nm, blue) and near- (3 μm, green) and 
mid-infrared (20 μm, red) as a function of displacements per lattice atom, ndpa. Only the 635 nm data was fitted using 
Boltzmann’s sigmoidal equation (gray solid line). Note, the dotted lines between data points are guides for the eye. (b) 
Selected reflectance spectra in the infrared before and after irradiation with low ndpa values (blue to green). (c) Extracted 
Gaussian peak areas of some characteristic reflection peaks. The h(009) and h(013) peak areas are normalized to the 
values  corresponding  to  an  intrinsic  hexagonal  GST  film.  The  r(200)  area  values  are  normalized  to  the  value  of  the 

7 

 
 
 
intrinsic h(013) reflection to account for different contributions of rock-salt and hexagonal phases. (d) XRD patterns of 
intrinsic (hexagonal) and irradiated GST films with increasing ndpa around the region of the h(013) and r(200) reflections 
corresponding to the hexagonal and rock-salt phase, respectively. 

In figure 3a, we show the reflectance change of hexagonal GST films on Si after Ar+-ion irradiation as a function 

of ndpa at visible (635 nm), near-IR (3 μm), and mid-IR (20 µm) wavelengths. The reflectance in the visible 

reaches  the  value  of  the  amorphous  phase  for  ndpa  ≈  1,  which  matches  well  the  trend  in  the  in-situ 

measurements (compare figure 1). Due to the non-uniform damage profile within the GST film, the observable 

amorphization  threshold  is  shifted  towards  higher  ndpa  for  infrared  wavelengths.  Figure  3b  shows  the  IR 

reflectance spectra of hexagonal GST films prior and after irradiation with low ndpa values between 0.006 and 

0.12  (blue  to  green).  The  optical  properties  of 

intrinsic  hexagonal  GST—a  degenerate  p-type 

semiconductor16—are  dominated  by  a  pronounced  Drude  contribution  in  the  IR  spectral  region  caused  by 

intrinsic, ordered vacancy layers (van der Waals gaps). Note that the sputtered GST films are polycrystalline; 

thus, any optical anisotropy is averaged out. The van der Waals gaps are responsible for the high mobility in 

hexagonal GST due to delocalized states. The Drude contribution results in a high and increasing reflectance 

with respect to mid-IR wavelengths, which was clearly reduced upon ion irradiation with low ndpa values due to 

the  creation  of  point  defects  (vacancies,  interstitials,  or  replacements)  and  small  defect  clusters.  This 

decrease of the Drude contribution is caused by a reduction in the free-carrier concentration and/or mobility. 

Ion irradiation induces a disordering of the inherent vacancy layers37, which is accompanied by the formation 

of  localized  states  and  a  reduction  of  delocalized  states,  which  leads  to  a  reduction  of  carrier 

concentration/mobility and is indeed observed in the infrared spectra for low ion fluences in figure 3b. This 

disorder-driven metal-to-insulator transition can be regarded as the inverse process of the vacancy-ordering-

induced insulator-to-metal transition upon thermal annealing17. 

XRD measurements were performed on the hexagonal GST films after ion irradiation. Figure 3d displays some 

representative XRD patterns around 2θ ≈ 29°. Here, only the contributions of the h(013) (

 29.0°) and the 

r(200) (

 29.6°) reflections can be seen. Both reflections can be identified for the intrinsic, annealed GST film; 

∼

thus,  there  is  a  minor  portion  of  rock-salt  phase  within  the  intrinsic  hexagonal  GST  film  even  before  ion 

∼

bombardment. However, the contribution of each reflection changes upon ion bombardment, and thus reveals 

an  increased  portion  of  rock-salt  phase  compared  to  hexagonal  phase  for  increasing  ndpa.  There  are  no 

reflections for ndpa > 4, indicating complete amorphization. 

8 

 
 
The normalized area of the h(013) reflection, which is given in figure 3c, remains roughly constant upon ion 

bombardment for ndpa < 0.1 and then gradually decreases until vanishing due to complete amorphization. In 

contrast, the r(200) reflection area first increases up to ndpa ~ 0.5 before decreasing due to amorphization. 

This  further  reveals  an  increase  of  the  portion  of  rock-salt  phase  inside  the  film  for  low  ndpa  values 

accompanied with a reduction of the hexagonal phase.  

Density functional theory (DFT) simulations on vacancy layer formation in disordered crystalline GST37,49 have 

shown that the rock-salt structure has a lower formation energy compared to the hexagonal structure when 

both contain depleted layers with 50% vacancy concentrations. Thus, as the vacancy occupancy of the van 

der Waals gaps decreases upon ion irradiation to about 50%, the rock-salt structure becomes energetically 

more favorable. Hence, the energy penalty that occurs upon vacancy disordering in the hexagonal phase is 

causing the structural transition from hexagonal to rock-salt. 

Furthermore, the reduction of the h(009) reflection (figure 3c) is shifted to lower ndpa compared to the h(013) 

peak,  which  indicates  a  loss  of  the  nine-plane  periodicity  in  hexagonal  GST11–13,15,50.  This  reveals  that  the 

periodicity that is linked to the van der Waals gaps is lost prior to the phase transformation of the hexagonal 

structure. Moreover, the trend of the h(009) reflection correlates well with the trend for the reflectance at 20 

µm (figure 3a), corroborating the link between the van der Waals gaps and the carrier mobility, and thus the 

Drude response of hexagonal GST. 

Note also that the r(200) reflection and the optical reflectance at 3 µm correlate well, because rock-salt GST 

is more reflective than hexagonal GST48. Comparing these trends with that from h(009) and the reflectance at 

20 µm suggests that there is no direct correlation between the metal-insulator transition and the structural 

hexagonal to rock-salt transition, which is in good agreement with previous studies17,37.

IV. IN-SITU ANNEALING OF DEFECTS DURING ION IRRADIATION 

Figure 4  (a) Comparison of the reflectance at 635 nm of initially rock-salt (green) and hexagonal (blue) GST films on Si 
upon Ar irradiation for in-situ (constant flux of 2x1011 cm-2s-1, 100 keV, 45°) and ex-situ experiments (55 keV, 7°) as a 
function of displacements per lattice atom. The ex-situ measurements were fitted using Boltzmann’s sigmoidal equation 
(gray lines). (b) In-situ optical measurements of initially rock-salt (green) and hexagonal (blue) GST films on Si upon Ar 
irradiation (180 keV, 45°)  for different ion fluxes. (c,d) Extracted critical number of displacements per atom ndpa (defined 
as inflection point of reflectance curves) to compare (c) in-situ and ex-situ experiments and (d) different ion fluxes. 

Because all measurements were carried out at room temperature, the induced lattice damage may partially 

recover due to thermal recombination of mobile defects. Thus, the amount of created residual disorder is a 

consequence of two opposing effects: the rate of atomic displacements upon ion irradiation versus the rate 

of defect migration and recombination at a given temperature. The 635 nm reflectance of ~100 nm crystalline 

GST films on Si upon Ar+-ion irradiation is given in figure 4a for in-situ and ex-situ measurements, respectively. 

The basic difference between the in-situ and ex-situ measurements is the timeframe between irradiation and 

optical measurement. While the impact on the reflectance is measured directly during ion bombardment in 

the in-situ measurements, there are typically several minutes to hours between irradiation and ex-situ optical 

measurements. Note, that further measurements after weeks/months do not show further changes. For ease 

of comparison, the ion energy was chosen so that the irradiation defect depth profiles are similar for ex-situ 

10 

 
 
 
(ion energy: 55 keV, angle of incidence: 7°) and in-situ measurements (ion energy: 100 keV, angle of incidence: 

45°, see also supplementary material).  Note that the in-situ measurements shown in figure 4 are from different 

samples than the measurements shown in figure 1. 

The  reduction  in  reflectance  is  shifted  to  higher  ndpa  in  the  ex-situ  measurements  for  both  crystalline  GST 

phases. This can be attributed to annealing of lattice defects through migration and recombination at room 

temperature. Furthermore, for ex-situ measurements, the reflectance is roughly constant up to ndpa ≈ 0.05 and 

≈ 0.1 for the rock-salt and hexagonal phase, respectively. Thus, point defects and small defect clusters might 

be able to recover almost completely at room temperature within the ~hours between irradiation and optical 

measurement. Conversely, there is a gradual reduction of the in-situ reflectance for both phases at low ion 

fluences. In the in-situ measurements, apparently, the time between subsequent ion impacts into the same 

volume  is  not  sufficient  to  recover  even  for  small  amounts  of  point  defects  before  the  ongoing  ion 

bombardment leads to the formation of larger, more stable defects.  

Furthermore,  in-situ  optical  measurements  were  performed  with  different  ion  fluxes  (ion  energy:  180  keV, 

angle of incidence: 45°) of initially rock-salt and hexagonal GST films on Si (figure 4b), which corresponds to 

an altered rate of atomic displacements. However, the rate of defect migration and recombination should be 

independent of the ion flux and only depend on the sample’s temperature. Note that for the ion fluxes used 

here, significant macroscopic heating of the sample caused by the ion beam can be neglected; however, local 

heating  by  the  impinging  ions  may  occur  on  the  microscopic  scale  and  influences  the  annealing  effect. 

Apparently, increasing the ion flux by an order of magnitude leads to a shift of the amorphization threshold to 

smaller ndpa values for both phases resulting from an increased rate of atomic displacements. Moreover, this 

shift is smaller for the rock-salt than for the hexagonal phase, indicating a lower annealing rate. This is further 

corroborated by an overall lower amorphization threshold of rock-salt GST. By neglecting directional effects 

of ion-irradiated polycrystalline films, the rate of atomic displacements should be independent of the crystal 

structure of chemically identical media. However, the mobility and recombination of defects strongly depends 

on the crystal structure of GST. This is a consequence of different diffusion paths of defects and dislocated 

lattice atoms that clearly depend on the local atomic arrangement. It was reported that the van der Waals 

gaps in hexagonal GST serve as preferential sinks where displaced atoms are able to recombine39. Due to 

unfavorable Te-Te antibonds and low mobility of Te atoms, primarily Ge and Sb tend to migrate and recombine 

in  the  gaps.  As  these  gaps  are  not  found  in  rock-salt  GST,  the  resulting  annealing  rate  is  higher  in  the 

hexagonal phase, which leads to an increased critical ndpa for amorphization. 

11 

 
We extracted critical values of ndpa , which is defined as the inflection point of the reflectance curves, from 

Lorentzian fits to the derivatives of both ex-situ and in-situ measurements and the different ion fluxes (see 

supplementary  material),  which  are  depicted  in  figure  4c  and  d,  respectively.  While  ex-situ  measurements 

result in a ~1.5 times higher critical ndpa for hexagonal GST compared to in-situ, this ratio is reduced to ~1.2 

for  the  rock-salt  phase.  Coincidentally,  in  the  in-situ  measurements  very  similar  values  were  obtained  by 

comparing  the  different  ion  fluxes,  thus,  different  times  between  subsequent  ion  impacts  into  the  same 

volume. These observations further corroborate a higher defect mobility and recombination rate of hexagonal 

GST  compared  to  rock-salt  GST.  The  comparison  of  ex-situ  and  in-situ  measurements  suggests  that  the 

annealing of defects at room temperature is on the time scale of seconds or less. 

V. CONCLUSION 

In summary, we have demonstrated that ion irradiation can be utilized to tailor disorder in a phase-change 

material. In-situ optical and electrical measurements during noble gas ion bombardment of initially rock-salt 

and hexagonal GST thin films revealed complete amorphization at room temperature accompanied by large 

changes  of  the  reflectance  and  resistance.  Ex-situ  optical  and  structural  measurements  revealed  several 

structural and electronic transitions in GST thin films. While the transition from rock-salt to amorphous GST 

is caused by progressive amorphization via the accumulation of lattice defects, several transitions occur in 

hexagonal  GST  upon  ion  irradiation.  The  creation  of  point  defects  and  small  defect  clusters  leads  to 

disordering  of  the  inherent  vacancy  layers  (van  der  Waals  gaps)  that  are  responsible  for  the  metal-like 

conduction inside hexagonal GST. The vacancy disordering process drives the metal-insulator transition via 

the formation of localized states and a reduction of carrier mobility. XRD measurements revealed that further 

ion  irradiation  leads  to  a  transition  from  the  hexagonal  phase  to  the  rock-salt  phase,  until  eventually 

amorphization is reached at high ion fluences. By comparing in-situ and ex-situ measurements, and in-situ 

measurements with different ion fluxes, we found that hexagonal GST has a higher amorphization threshold 

compared to rock-salt GST, which is indicative of a higher resistance against ion-beam-induced disorder and 

thus a more stable hexagonal phase.

VI. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 

A. Sample Preparation 

GST thin films were grown by DC magnetron sputtering on (100)-silicon substrates and thermally oxidized 

SiO2/Si substrates. The magnetron sputtering conditions were 300 V and ~ 50 mA with an argon pressure of 

5 x 10-3 mbar at room temperature. Crystallization to the rock-salt phase of the as-deposited, amorphous GST 

films was achieved by heating the samples (heating rate: 10 K/min) up to 250°C in an Ar atmosphere while 

the  amplitude  of  the  reflection  at  635  nm  was  monitored.  Heating  the  samples  up  to  350°C  leads  to  the 

transition into hexagonal GST.  

B. Methods 

Crystalline  GST  films  were  irradiated  with  Ar+-ions  using  a  400  kV  single-ended  ion  accelerator  with  ion 

energies from 55 to 180 keV and beam fluxes from 1011 to 1012 cm−2s−1. The reflectivity and resistivity of the 

samples  in  the  in-situ  measurements  were  simultaneously  monitored  during  ion  bombardment.  The  light 

intensity reflected by the sample from a red laser diode (635 nm) is detected via a biased Si detector. Changes

Keithley 2000 multimeter. 

Reflectance  spectra  after  ion  irradiation  were  (ex-situ)  obtained  by  a  combination  of  UV-Vis  spectroscopy 

using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer and FTIR spectroscopy using a Varian 640-IR spectrometer. 

Structural  characterization  of  the  irradiated  GST  films  was  carried  out  using  a  Bruker  D8  Discovery  X-ray 

diffractometer in θ − 2θ mode and a Cu-Kα micro X-ray source.

S-I. IN-SITU EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

The  experimental  setup,  which  is  schematically  depicted  in  figure  S1,  allows  to  simultaneously  monitor 

changes  in  the  reflectivity  and/or  resistivity  of  a  sample  during  ion  bombardment.  Optical  measurements 

were conducted with a red laser diode (λc = 635 nm). The incoming and outgoing laser beams are guided 

through  a  window  (near-normal  incidence)  while  the  sample  is  tilted  to  45°  with  respect  to  the  ion  beam 

inside  the  irradiation  vacuum  chamber.  In  this  way,  changes  to  the  reflectivity  of  the  sample  upon  ion 

irradiation  are  directly  observed  by  detecting  the  light  intensity  reflected  by  the  sample  via  a  Si  detector. 

Simultaneously, changes to the resistivity are monitored by contacting the sample via conductive lacquer to 

a Keithley 2000 multimeter. Note that no predefined contacts were used; thus, absolute resistance values 

cannot  be  compared  due  to  different  contact  geometries  between  several  samples.  For  these  in-situ 

experiments,  the  beam  current  was  measured  via  Faraday  cups  with  a  defined  area  to  calculate  the  ion 

fluence.

Figure S2 (a,b) Ar concentration normalized to ion fluence c/Ni (top) and  total  displacements  per incident ion Ndispl 
(bottom) as a function of depth as simulated with TRIM1 for (a) 180 keV Ar+-ions at 45° incidence angle used in the in-
situ  measurements  and  (b)  55  keV  Ar+-ions  at  7°  incidence  angle  used  in  the  ex-situ  measurements.  (c)  Total 
displacements per incident ion Ndispl as a function of depth for 100 keV Ar+-ions at 45° incidence (top) and 55 keV Ar+-
ions at 7° incidence angle (bottom). For the comparison of in-situ and ex-situ measurements, the energy for the in-situ 
measurement  was  set  to  100  keV  to  achieve  a  very  comparable  damage  distribution  (compared  to  the  55  keV 
irradiation), because the angle of incidence changes for the different setups. 

To  account  for  different  Ndispl  of  the  respective  measurements,  the  number  of  displacements  per  lattice 

atom was calculated with: 

using the maximum of the number of displacements per incident ion 

 (with ion fluence NI). Note that 

𝑛𝑛𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 =  

𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚
𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑛𝑛𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎

× 𝑁𝑁𝐼𝐼

the atomic density nat slightly changes upon irradiation. As an approximation, for the calculation of ndpa only 

𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚
𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

the initial values of the respective GST phases were assumed. 

S-III. ION ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF LATTICE DEFECTS 

Multiple GST films (d ≈ 100 nm) on SiO2/Si and Si were irradiated with Ar+-ions at various energies. While in-

situ  optical  measurements  were  performed  during  ion  bombardment  of  GST  films  on  Si,  the  electrical 

measurements  required  the  SiO2/Si substrate.  The  results  from  both  measurement  setups  are  depicted  in 

figure S3. First, in-situ optical measurements were performed at 45° incidence angle for beam energies of 

100 keV and 180 keV at GST thin films on Si. The latter energy was used to ensure nearly uniform damage 

distribution across the entire film. Consequently, an inevitable amount of Ar+-ions reaches the substrate and

Figure S3 (a) Ar concentration per ion fluence c/Ni (top) and total displacements per incident ion Ndispl (bottom) for 
Ar+-ions into hexagonal GST with ion energies 100 keV and 180 keV and 45° incidence angle. (b) Reflectance at 635 
nm of initially hexagonal GST films on Si upon Ar irradiation at a constant flux of 2 × 1011 cm−2s−1 for the ion energies 
and  incidence  angle  of  (a).  (c)  Ar  concentration  per  ion  fluence  c/Ni  (top)  and  total  displacements  per  incident  ion 
Ndispl (bottom) as a function of depth for Ar+-ions into hexagonal GST with ion energies 55 keV and 150 keV and 7° 
incidence angle. (d) Resistance change of a GST film on SiO2/Si at a constant flux of 2 × 1011 cm−2s−1, which was first 
irradiated with an Ar ion energy of 55 keV and further irradiated with 150 keV at an incidence angle of 7°. 

possible interface mixing might influence the GST layer. Reducing the beam energy to 100 keV and keeping 

the angle at 45° leads to a non-uniform damage profile while most Ar+-ions remain in the film and interface 

mixing can be neglected. The reflectance change upon ion irradiation for these energies is given in figure 

S3b.  The  reflectance  decreases  down  to  the  expected  amorphous  value  in  both  cases  with  only  minor 

differences in the critical amount of induced lattice defects. This can be attributed to the different number 

of total displacements per ion for both energies (compare figure S3a). As the red laser light (λ = 635 nm) 

only  probes  roughly  the  first  50  nm  of  the  GST  film  (with  the  extinction  coefficient  being 

  4  for  both 

crystalline phases), the reflectance signal contains mainly information about the first half of the film. Thus, 

∼

the  slightly higher  amount  of  displacements  near  the  surface  for  the  100  keV  irradiation  compared  to  the 

higher beam energy of 180 keV explains the slightly smaller critical ion fluence for amorphization. 

A  similar  examination  was  performed  for  in-situ  electrical  measurements  on  approximately  100  nm  thick 

GST  films  on  SiO2/Si.  As  these  measurements  were  not  performed  simultaneously  to  the  in-situ  optical 

examination,  here,  an  incidence  angle  of  7°  was  chosen.  As  the  depth  distribution  of  damage  caused  by 

impinging  ions  is  also  determined  by  their  angle  of  incidence,  the  beam  energies  were  adjusted  properly. 

Similar damage profiles can be achieved by using 55 keV and 150 keV ions (see figure S3c). The resistance 

change  of  a  GST  film  upon  55  keV  ion  irradiation  is  depicted  in  figure  S3d.  Even  for  comparable  high  ion 

fluences well above previously obtained amorphization thresholds the resistance only slightly increases. On 

the other hand, subsequent irradiation with 150 keV ions of the same sample leads to a drastic increase in 
3 

 
 
 
resistance to the expected change caused by amorphization. As the induced lattice damage at the interface 

of the GST and SiO2 films is negligible for a beam energy of 55 keV, a non-damaged path with low resistance 

remains that mainly affects the total sheet resistance (see inset of figure S3d). Therefore, the beam energy 

and thus the penetration depth plays an important role for investigating disorder in GST films via electrical 

methods but has no significant impact on the in-situ optical measurements at 635 nm for rather thick films 

(

  100  nm).  However,  below  the  optical  gap  of  GST,  i.e.,  its  absorption-free  thus  transmissive  spectral 

region  (mainly  in  the  IR),  inadvertent  interface  mixing  for  higher  ion  energies  may  reduce  thin-film 
≳
interference effects that are then independent of changes in the refractive indices. Therefore, 55 keV Ar+-

ions were used for the ex-situ measurements to avoid interface mixing. 

S-IV. CALCULATION OF REFLECTANCE  

Light propagation through single and multilayer thin films can be described by using the Fresnel equations. 

Here,  we  used  a  MATLAB  based  code  that  relies  on  the  transfer  matrix  method  to  calculate  reflectance 

values  from  the  respective  refractive  indices  of  the  individual  layers.  Considering  Fresnel  and  Maxwell’s 

equations,  a  simple  2x2  matrix  can  be  used  to  describe  the  electric  field  within  a  single  layer.  The 

description  of  multi-layers  is  then  the  product  of  each  layer’s  matrix  and  can  be  solved  while  also 

considering internal reflections and interference of coherent light waves. Refractive index values were taken 

from references2–4.
