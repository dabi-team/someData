Abstract We analyze sunspots rotation and magnetic transients in NOAA AR 11429 dur-
ing two X-class (X5.4 and X1.3) ﬂares using the data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. A large leading sunspot with positive
magnetic polarity rotated counterclockwise. As expected, the rotation was signiﬁcantly
affected by the two ﬂares. The magnetic transients induced by the ﬂares were clearly ev-
ident in the sunspots with negative polarity. They were moving across the sunspots with
speed of order 3 − 7 km s−1. Furthermore, the trend of magnetic ﬂux evolution of these
sunspots exhibited changes associated with the ﬂares. These results may shed light on the
understanding of the evolution of sunspots.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sunspots are concentrations of strong magnetic ﬁeld on the solar surface, consisting of a dark umbra and
a ﬁbrous penumbra (Solanki 2003). It is generally accepted that eruption events such as ﬂares occurring
in upper atmosphere are associated with magnetic ﬁeld generated from the base of convection zone,
emerging as bipolar magnetic regions at solar surface, then extending to corona (Solanki et al. 2006).
So the visible sunspots play an important role in studying a variety of phenomena on the Sun.

The evolution of sunspots includes formation, movement, deformation and disappearance. Rotation
is an important feature during evolution. In general, there are two kinds of rotation: one sunspot rotates
around its umbral centre and one sunspot rotates around the other (Yan & Qu 2012). The rotation of
sunspots and spot-groups have been studied for many decades (see, e.g., Evershed 1910; St. John 1913;
Maltby 1964; Brown et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2007; Yan et al. 2009; Min & Chae 2009). Yan et al.
(2008b) found 182 signiﬁcantly rotating sunspots among 2959 active regions. Some authors believed
the rotational motion of sunspots may be involved with energy build-up and later release by ﬂares (e.g.,
Stenﬂo 1969; Barnes & Sturrock 1972; Hiremath et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2008). Furthermore, the rela-
tionships between the sunspot rotation and coronal consequence (Brown et al. 2003; Tian et al. 2008),
ﬂare productivity (Yan et al. 2008a; Zhang et al. 2008; Ruan et al. 2014), direction of the rotation (Zheng
et al. 2016), and magnetic helicities (Vemareddy et al. 2012) have been investigated. The association of

ﬂares with abnormal rotation rates (Hiremath et al. 2005) has been found. Speciﬁcally, Wang et al.
(2014) reported two sunspots in AR 11158 rotating along with a X2.2 ﬂare. Liu et al. (2016) reported a
non-uniform rotation induced by a M6.5 ﬂare in NOAA AR 12371, and Bi et al. (2016) found an abrupt
reverse rotation of sunspot in NOAA AR 12158 caused by back reaction of X1.6 ﬂare.

Besides, the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld changes during the ﬂares. The magnetic ﬁeld is distorted
enough to store energy powering ﬂare. After a ﬂare taking place, the distorted ﬁeld relax and restructure
(Sakurai & Hiei 1996). There are two kinds of changes of magnetic ﬁeld based on observations: the ﬁrst
is rapid short-term changes (Patterson & Zirin 1981; Zhao et al. 2009), which is due to ﬂare-induced
spectral line changes (Patterson 1984; Qiu & Gary 2003). It is generally believed that the rapid short-
term changes are not the real changes of magnetic ﬁeld (see, Ding et al. 2002). However, Harker &
Pevtsov (2013) also analyzed the magnetic transients during the M7.9 ﬂare in NOAA AR 11429 on 13
March 2012 and suggested that the magnetic transients represented a real change in the photospheric
magnetic ﬁled. Another is irreversible changes from pre-ﬂare to post-ﬂare (e.g., Spirock et al. 2002;
Wang et al. 2002; Wang 2006; Song & Zhang 2016). The irreversible changes were ﬁrst noticed by
Wang et al. (1994). They showed that magnetic shear increased after ﬂares with vector magnetic ﬁeld
data. Cameron & Sammis (1999) reported a change in the line-of-sight (LOS) ﬁeld during the X9.3 ﬂare
on 24 May 1990 with the videomagnetograph data from the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). Sudol
& Harvey (2005) and Petrie & Sudol (2010) analyzed the changes of the LOS magnetic ﬁeld during some
X- and M- class ﬂares with Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) magnetograms. The median
duration of changes was about 15 minutes and the median absolute value of changes was about 69 G.
Wang & Liu (2010) demonstrated that the change of LOS magnetic ﬁeld is due to increase of horizontal
magnetic ﬁeld near the polarity inversion line. With the seeing-free data of vector magnetograms, Liu
et al. (2012) found that the photospheric transverse magnetic ﬁeld enhancement was associated with the
M6.6 ﬂare in NOAA AR 11158. Wang et al. (2012) observed the same phenomenon associated with the
X2.2 ﬂare in this active region. These results suggested that the magnetic ﬁeld near the polarity inversion
line could become more horizontal after a ﬂare.

In this study, we analyze the evolution of sunspots in NOAA AR 11429. We will explore the rotation
of sunspots along with the ﬂares, i.e., how do the ﬂares and the rotation of sunspots affect each other.
The magnetic transients induced by ﬂares are studied in prior works. We further study the motion of the
magnetic transients to understand how the ﬂares inﬂuence sunspots. The paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we describe the data used and the entire structure of the active region. Section 3 shows data
processing. We summarize and discuss the results in Section 4.

2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA

The 45 s cadence and spatial sampling of 0′′.5 pixel−1 full-disk continuum intensity images and line-
of-sight magnetograms observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO) are used to analyze the variation of sunspots in NOAA
AR 11429. The images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board
SDO are used to investigate the chromospheric and coronal context: AIA 304 ˚A formed in transition
region and chromosphere, and AIA 1600 ˚A formed in upper photosphere and transition region.

AR 11429 appeared on the eastern limb on 3 March 2012, and then rapidly became complicated
reverse-polarity βγδ active region. The evolution and development of AR 11429 from 5 March to 12
March are displayed in Figure 1. It is interesting to note that the sunspots in this active region were
moving away from each other, i.e., the leading sunspots moving westward and the following sunspots
moving eastward. Several major eruptions were clearly visible in this active region. Typically, three X-
class ﬂares occurred: one (X1.1) on 5 March and two of interest (X5.4 and X1.3) on 7 March. The GOES
soft X-ray ﬂux (Figure 3a) indicates that the X5.4 ﬂare started at 00:02 UT, peaked at 00:27 UT, and
ended at 00:40 UT, and the X1.3 ﬂare started at 01:05 UT, peaked at 01:14 UT, and ended at 01:23 UT.
The evolution of ﬁve prominent sunspots, two positive polarity sunspots (P1 and P2) and three negative
polarity sunspots (N1, N2 and N3), were associated with these two ﬂares, as be discussed in the next
section.

3 ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

3.1 Sunspots rotating associated with ﬂares

To study the rotation, we take the rotation of individual sunspots as a simpliﬁed solid-body rotation (i.e.,
a sunspot rotates around its umbral center), and track the variation of the ellipses that best ﬁt individual
sunspots on time-series intensity images (see Bi et al. 2016). Take sunspot P1 as an example. The best-ﬁt
ellipses on the intensity images at 23:29:23 UT of 6 March and 01:28:38 UT of 7 March are shown in
Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b), respectively. Obviously, the major axis rotates counterclockwise about 7◦.
In the present study, the changes of the angle between the major axis and the horizontal direction of the
best-ﬁt ellipses are used to describe the rotation of the sunspot. The results together with the GOES soft
X-ray ﬂux are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3(b) shows that P1 rotated mainly counterclockwise from ∼23:30 UT of 6 March to ∼01:30
UT of 7 March. Before the start of the X5.4 ﬂare, the rotation was very fast with speed up to 7.92◦ hr−1.
From start to peak of the ﬂare, the rotation speed decreased slowly to about 4.89◦ hr−1 and the rotation
trend kept counterclockwise. Just after the peak of the ﬂare, the rotation trend reversed from counter-
clockwise to clockwise. Its speed was about 4.07◦ hr−1. After the ﬂare, the rotation direction returned
to counterclockwise with the rotation speed of about 6.56◦ hr−1, and the rotation speed increased grad-
ually until the beginning of the X1.3 ﬂare. Later, the rotation trend reversed to clockwise again with the
rotation speed of about 6.44◦ hr−1 and slowed down. These results indicate that the rotation of sunspot
P1 was signiﬁcantly affected by both ﬂares. The relative mean intensity proﬁles in different AIA wave-
lengths, obtained from the co-aligned with HMI images, are also plotted in Figure 3. The intensity in the
AIA wavelengths of 304 ˚A (green curve) and AIA 1600 ˚A (blue curve) started rising around 00:05 UT,
peaked at about 00:07 UT, and then decreased during the impulsive phase of the X5.4 ﬂare. At about
01:05 UT, the intensities started rising again and peaked at about 01:14 UT. It provides further support
for the view that solar ﬂares are often related to the rotation of sunspots.

The rotation of the sunspot N1 was complicated (Figure 3c). Before the peak of the X5.4 ﬂare, the
rotation trend was mainly counterclockwise, and then reversed to clockwise. The situation around the
X1.3 ﬂare was similar to that around the former ﬂare. The intensity of AIA wavelengths increased and
the rotation changed signiﬁcantly during the impulsive phases of the X5.4 and X1.3 ﬂares. As shown in
Figure 3(d), sunspot N2 rotated clockwise from ∼00:15 UT to ∼00:40 UT. The relative mean intensity
of 1600 ˚A in this sunspot started rising at ∼00:05 UT and reached its maximum at ∼00:20 UT. The
relative mean intensity of 304 ˚A started rising at ∼00:05 UT and reached its maximum at ∼00:30 UT.
So the X5.4 ﬂare affected the rotation of sunspot N2. The sunspot N3 remained stable during the two
ﬂares (Figure 3e). The rotation speed was poorly correlated with the intensity of AIA wavelengths, and
therefore the X5.4 and X1.3 ﬂares.

3.2 The motion of Magnetic Transient

Magnetic transients induced by ﬂares have been well investigated by Patterson (1984) and Qiu & Gary
(2003). They analyzed the cause, location and level of the magnetic transients. Here, we ﬁnd that there
are some magnetic transients moving through sunspots N1, N2 and N3, and there is no apparent mag-
netic transient motion in the sunspots P1 and P2. Because the polarity of the sunspots N1, N2 and
N3 is negative (black regions in the magnetograms), the magnetic transients means that the polarity is
reversed.

Figure 4 shows the changes of the magnetic ﬁeld in sunspot N1. At 01:09 UT of 7 March, the mag-
netic transients marked by red arrows in the umbra of the sunspot can be clearly seen. These magnetic
transients (the positive magnetic ﬁeld) moved toward the southeast direction. At 01:14 UT, the area with
positive magnetic ﬁeld became larger while the strength became weaker, as shown in Figure 4(a2). The
green line in Figure 4(a3) indicates the moving trajectory of the positive polarity points. To investigate
the kinematic evolution of the reversed polarity, the time-distance plots obtained along the green trajec-
tory line are shown in Figure 4(d). A white streak is clearly visible. It started at ∼01:07 UT and ended at

4

J.-C. Zheng et al.

∼01:16 UT, consistent with the time of the X1.3 ﬂare. It might imply that the reversed magnetic polarity
was caused by this ﬂare. The distance corresponding to the streak was about 5 arcsec. Thus, the moving
speed of the magnetic transients can be estimated to be about 6.59 km s−1. Similarly, some magnetic
transients (i.e., the reversed magnetic ﬁeld) were presented in sunspots N2 and N3, and probably asso-
ciated with the X5.4 ﬂare, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. They were moving toward southeast with speed
about 3.69 km s−1 and 3.22 km s−1 respectively.

In order to check whether the magnetic transients were co-spatial with ﬂare ribbons, we further
examined the co-aligned AIA 304 ˚A and AIA 1600 ˚A images corresponding to HMI magnetograms,
which are displayed in panels (b1)–(b3) and panels (c1)–c(3) in Figures 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The ﬂare
ribbons can be seen in these panels. They were separating from each other. The locations of sunspots
N1, N2 and N3 in AIA images, marked by magnetogram contours at -800 G, were moving with ﬂare
ribbons. This implies the magnetic transients were co-spatial with ﬂare ribbons.

We calculated magnetic ﬂux of sunspots N1, N2 and N3 for the regions marked by the red rect-
angular boxes in Figure 1. The magnetic ﬂux of sunspots with negative polarity together with GOES
soft X-ray ﬂux are shown in Figure 7. Before the start of the X5.4 ﬂare, the absolute value of magnetic
ﬂux in sunspot N1 decreased slowly. From the start to peak of the ﬂare, it decreased gradually. Then,
the value kept almost unchanged. At the end of the ﬂare, it increased slightly. During the period of the
X1.3 ﬂare, the absolute value of magnetic ﬂux decreased ﬁrst and then increased abruptly. These results
suggest that the changes of trend of magnetic ﬂux in sunspot N1 were caused by both the X5.4 ﬂare and
the X1.3 ﬂare.

The magnetic ﬂux of sunspot N2 mainly increased from 23:30 UT of 6 March to 01:30 UT of
7 March. There was an obvious change near the peak of X5.4 ﬂare. Speciﬁcally, the absolute value
decreased ﬁrst and then increased, as shown in Figure 7(c). The absolute magnetic ﬂux value of sunspot
N3 (Figure 7d) almost kept unchanged before the start of the X5.4 ﬂare. Similarly, during the X5.4 ﬂare
, the magnetic ﬂux decreased rapidly, and then increased monotonically. These results suggest that the
changes of trend of magnetic ﬂux in sunspots N2 and N3 were mainly due to the X5.4 ﬂare.

4 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

AR 11429 is a complicated active region with a reversed polarity structure, in contrast with the nature
of solar cycle 24. It has a large leading sunspot with positive magnetic polarity (P1) exhibiting signif-
icant counterclockwise rotation. The rotation underwent some changes during two X-class (X5.4 and
X1.3) ﬂares. It is possible that the ﬂares were triggered by the sunspot rotation (see Zhang et al. 2008;
Vemareddy et al. 2016), and in turn they reacted back and affected the sunspot P1 rotation.

The magnetic transients induced by the two X-class ﬂares can be seen in sunspots with negative
magnetic polarity (N1, N2 and N3). They moved outward with respect to the center of the active region
and moved through the sunspots quickly with speed up to about 6.59 km s−1. The magnetic transients
lasted for about ten minutes within the period of the X5.4 and X1.3 ﬂare. As expected, the magnetic
transients, which are clearly illustrated in sunspots N1, N2 and N3 were moving away from the polarity
inversion line shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6. The magnetic transients occurred during the X5.4 and X1.3
ﬂares were co-spatial with ﬂare ribbons. This is consistent with Maurya et al. (2012), who found that
magnetic transients in AR 11158 during a X2.2 ﬂare persisted for a few minutes and showed co-spatial
with ﬂare ribbons, which were separating out with a mean velocity of 8 km s−1.

During the evolution of sunspots (N1, N2 and N3), changes in the trend of magnetic ﬁeld evolution
were presented, and are associated with the two X-class ﬂares. Similar results in ﬁve δ sunspots were
found by Wang (2006). The increasing and decreasing tendency of the magnetic ﬂux in active region
might be attributed to magnetic ﬂux emergence and magnetic cancellation (van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green
2015).

The evolution of sunspots with complicated structure can be affected by many factors such as in-
teraction among sunspots within same active region, physical change induced by ﬂare, and interaction
between magnetic ﬁeld and plasma. In this study, we have found that the motion and the trend of mag-

netic ﬁeld evolution of sunspots are signiﬁcantly affected by ﬂares. Other inﬂuences on the evolution of
sunspots will be examined in future studies.

Fig. 4 The reversed magnetic ﬁeld moving through sunspot N1. The red arrows in (a1) and
(a2) indicate the location of the reversed magnetic ﬁeld and the green line in (a3) indicates
the trajectory of the moving reversed magnetic ﬁeld. (b1)–(b3) The co-aligned AIA 304 ˚A
images corresponding to HMI magnetograms. The blue contours represent the magnetic ﬁeld
of sunspot N1 at -800 G. (c1)–(c3) The co-aligned AIA 1600 ˚A images overlaid by magne-
togram contours of sunspot N1. (d) Time-slice plot of the trajectory. The blue dashed line
shows the evolution of the reversed magnetic ﬁeld. The red curve overlaid on the time-slice
plot is the GOES soft X-ray ﬂux.
