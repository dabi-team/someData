ABSTRACT
We study the triggering mechanism of a limb-prominence eruption and the associated coronal mass
ejection near AR 12342 using SDO and LASCO/SOHO observations. The prominence is seen with an
embedded ﬂux thread (FT) at one end and bifurcates from the middle to a diﬀerent footpoint loca-
tion. The morphological evolution of the FT is similar to an unstable ﬂux rope (FR), which we regard
as prominence embedded FR. The FR twist exceeds the critical value. In addition, the morphology
of the prominence plasma in 304˚A images marks the helical nature of the magnetic skeleton with a
total of 2.96 turns along arc length. The potential ﬁeld extrapolation model indicates that the critical
height of the background magnetic ﬁeld gradient falls within the inner corona (105Mm) consistent
with the extent of coronal plasma loops. These results suggest that the helical kink instability in
the embedded FR caused the slow rise of the prominence to a height of the torus instability domain.
Moreover, the diﬀerential emission measure analysis unveils heating of the prominence plasma to coro-
nal temperatures during eruption, suggesting a reconnection-related heating underneath the upward
rising embedded FR. The prominence starts with a slow rise motion of 10km/s, followed by fast and
slow acceleration phases having an average acceleration of 28.9m/s2, 2.4m/s2 in C2, C3 ﬁeld of view
respectively. As predicted by previous numerical simulations, the observed synchronous kinematic
proﬁles of the CME leading edge and the core supports the involved FR instability in the prominence
initiation.

1. INTRODUCTION
Solar prominences are the most common coronal
features, with plasma embedded in the magnetic en-
vironment lying along and above magnetic inversion
lines (Tandberg-Hanssen et al. 1974; Tandberg-Hanssen
1998). They contain cool and dense plasma indicating
thermally and pressure isolated from the surrounding
corona. They appear at the limb as bright features when
observed in optical and EUV lines, and in microwaves;
they appear dark, referred to as ﬁlaments, on the disk.
Of the many scientiﬁc aspects of prominences, explaining
their loss of equilibrium to erupt as part of coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) is one of the major aspects relevant to
space-weather (Vial & Engvold 2015).

The ﬁrst prominence model, proposed by Kippenhahn
& Schl¨uter (1957), assumes a magnetic conﬁguration
where the gravity force of the prominence is balanced
by the Lorentz force. This basic model has now evolved
into sheared arcade and ﬂux rope (Antiochos 1998; An-
tiochos et al. 1999; Pneuman 1983; Rust & Kumar 1996;
Amari et al. 2003) models. In both models, the promi-
nence material rests in the dipped regions of magnetic
ﬁeld lines (Mackay et al. 2010). Accordingly, breakout
(Antiochos et al. 1999) and tether-cutting (Moore et al.
2001; Moore & Sterling 2006) reconnection mechanisms
in the sheared arcade scenario, helical kink and torus-
instabilities (Forbes & Isenberg 1991; Priest & Forbes
2002; T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005; Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Zhang
et al. 2012) in the ﬂux rope scenario have been proposed
and employed to explain the underlying physical mecha-

vemareddy@iiap.res.in

nism in most of the observed prominence/ﬁlament erup-
tions. While reconnection plays a fundamental role in
the earlier models, ideal MHD instability leads to the
onset of eruption in the later models.

High quality space based multi-wavelength observa-
tions from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer
(TRACE; Handy et al. 1999 ) and Atmospheric Imag-
ing Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012)
have helped testing the proposed models with the ob-
servations. Tether-cutting reconnection has been found
to play a triggering role in several observational studies
(e.g., Liu et al. 2007; Yurchyshyn et al. 2006; Liu et al.
2010; Vemareddy et al. 2012b). A reconnection in the
overarching loop system, which is identiﬁed commonly as
a brightening, sets in the run-away tether-cutting recon-
nection below the sheared arcade, and subsequent erup-
tion of core ﬁeld as CME. The CME initiation by helical
kink-instability of ﬂux rope is evidenced in the recent ob-
servational studies (e.g., Williams et al. 2005; Alexander
et al. 2006; Srivastava et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2012).
Signatures of kinking-writhing of ﬂux rope like structure
are substantiated by the observed morphology in diﬀer-
ent wavelengths (Green et al. 2007; Gilbert et al. 2007).
In fact, local distribution of photospheric magnetic twist
supports the origin of the underlying twist (Vemareddy
& Zhang 2014; Vemareddy et al. 2016). The role of torus
instability becomes signiﬁcant after the ﬂux rope reached
a certain height, from where steeply decreasing magnetic
ﬁeld gradient in the ambient corona drives the eruption
(T¨or¨ok et al. 2004). Recent studies found a character-
istic curve of horizontal ﬁeld gradients with height for

eruptive ﬂares as an indication of the ability of the ﬂux
rope to experience torus instability (Cheng et al. 2011).
Most observational studies claim direct evidence of
ideal kink-instability with the ﬂux system underlying
the prominence body (e.g., Rust & Kumar 1996; Srivas-
tava et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2012). Sometimes promi-
nences appear as kinked illuminating in hot EUV chan-
nels. These are interpreted as twisted ﬂux ropes, which
are uncommon (Lites 2005; Zhang et al. 2012; Cheng
et al. 2014). Large-scale prominence structures, ﬁlled
with cool dense plasma, had been noticed with long-time
stability, even over months (Mackay et al. 2010). Such
cases require a diﬀerent mechanism for stability loss and
the subsequent eruption. Therefore, the global struc-
ture and equilibrium of the prominence environment is
an open question.

Recent observational studies ﬁnd that unstable part of
the ﬁlament belongs to a part of the magnetic structure
that the ﬁlament is hosted (Liu et al. 2012; Vemareddy
& Zhang 2014). Reconciling the diﬀerent structures ob-
served in ﬁlaments and prominences on the disk versus
limb is crucial for understanding the triggering mecha-
nisms of eruptions. With this background, we studied
an erupting prominence that occurred on May 9, 2015,
showing evidence for the prominence-associated ﬂux rope
undergoing ideal kink instability and causing the large-
scale CME eruption. Such cases are uncommon as the in-
stability part is generally the prominence itself and iden-
tifying it in on-disk observations is crucial in identifying
the trigger mechanism. For completeness, we also stud-
ied the prominence thermal properties and the kinemat-
ics of the associated CME. A brief description of the ob-
servational data is given in Section 2, the analysis results
are presented in Section 3 and Summary and discussion
are given in Section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONS
We use observations from the SDO and the Large An-
gle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO, Brueck-
ner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SoHO). The dynamics of the prominence,
and post eruption loops upto 1.2R(cid:12) are captured in the
multi-thermal EUV images of the AIA at a cadence of
12s. The magnetic roots of the coronal plasma struc-
tures are studied using photospheric line-of-sight mag-
netograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Schou et al. 2012). HMI obtains full disk line-of-
sight magnetograms at a cadence of 45s and vector mag-
netic ﬁelds at a cadence of 135s. The CME evolution in
the extended outer corona is imaged by white-light coro-
nagraphs LASCO/C2 (1.5-6R(cid:12)) and LASCO/C3 (3.5-
32R(cid:12)). In addition, we obtained GONG Hα images in
H i 6563˚A wavelength at 1(cid:48)(cid:48) per pixel resolution.

The prominence erupted on May 9, 2015, at 01:00UT
from NOAA active region (AR) 12342 located near the
east limb (N18E53). Figure 1 presents the erupting
prominence in the AIA 193˚A pass band and the white-
light LASCO observations of the CME. Time diﬀerence
maps in AIA 193˚A show the extended over-arching loops
and the surrounding less bright cavity region together
enveloping the core prominence oriented approximately
in north-south direction. When the prominence reached
the ﬁeld-of-view of the LASCO/C2, it was found to be

in the interior part of the CME preserving the three part
structure (Hundhausen 1987) up to a distance of approx-
imately 15R(cid:12).
Its further propagation in LASCO/C3
FOV follows merged and diﬀused structure with domi-
nant lateral expansion than radial motion.

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
3.1. Morphology
In Figure 2, we plotted the summary of a multitude
of observations showing the morphological evolution of
the prominence during the onset of the eruption (00:00–
01:14UT on May 9). Hα observations show the promi-
nence and the roots of its legs in the lower chromosphere.
The barb section, as a third leg, bifurcates from the apex
to a diﬀerent footpoint location (F3) in the lower chro-
mosphere, and it is visible while the prominence rises.
Movies reveal more details on the supporting magnetic
structure in the prominence system. There are essen-
tially two branches of ﬂux threads intermingled as a sin-
gle structure toward the southern footpoint F1. While
rising, the ﬂux threads from the leg of F3 appear to have
a diﬀerent branch than the main prominence. Recent
studies using AIA data interpret two diﬀerent ﬂux sys-
tems stacked over each other where the lower one, in the
form of sigmoid, sets to erupt (Vemareddy et al. 2012b;
Liu et al. 2012; Vemareddy & Zhang 2014) which is in
question in diﬀerent cases. The May 9 event is an ex-
ample to such cases having two branches of ﬂux threads
that are connected to each other at one end. The visibil-
ity of any ﬂux system depends on the thermal conditions
of the embedded plasma against the disk.

The AIA 304˚A images, which give plasma informa-
tion from the chromosphere and transition region (He ii
∼ 104K), show the prominence and its surroundings ﬁlled
with plasma. In both Hα and 304˚A, the prominence con-
tains bright emitting plasma. In hotter channels of 193,
211, 131˚A, the prominence plasma is opaque (optically
thick) and the coronal closed ﬁeld environment overly the
prominence. From simple scaling measurement, we in-
fer that the entrapping ﬁeld extends upto 110Mm above
the photosphere. Since the peak temperature sensitiv-
ity is > 106K in 131˚A, the prominence material appears
dim compared to the ambient plasma loops. Unlike the
Hα, EUV observations provide more details on the cur-
vature of the prominence. Its lower section, before the
onset, is curved and dipped down possibly due to the
helical nature of the magnetic ﬁeld (dotted curve). Such
structures appear to have S or inverse-S shape when seen
in projection onto the solar surface. From the observed
curvature, we infer an S-shaped prominence. Flare rib-
bons are formed in the chromosphere due to the coro-
nal reconnection under the rising prominence, and in-
deed have S-shape ribbon morphology as seen in UV
(see AIA 1600 211.mp4) and Hα observations.
In tan-
dem, post eruption arcade (PEA) is seen in EUV im-
ages straddling the polarity inversion line (PIL, see Fig-
ure 10). However, the PEA is too weak to be recognized
in disk-integrated GOES X-ray ﬂux. As the AR magnetic
ﬂux associated with footpoints is seen to be diﬀusing in
time, it is likely that the magnetic structure supporting
the prominence is formed by slow magnetic reconnec-
tion (Pneuman 1983; van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989;
Amari et al. 2003)) over days before this eruption.

193˚A showing clear three-part structure of core, cavity and leading edge, c) and d) erupted prominence being observed in LASCO C2 and
C3 as white-light CME.

3.2. Helical kink nature
The morphology of the prominence in 304˚A marks
the helical nature of the magnetic ﬁeld lines and their
handedness. When the magnetic threads are twisted
in a bundle, the gap between the threads appears as a
dark lane around the bundle compared to the thread in
304˚Aemission. The trace of either dark or bright feature
essentially provides the twisted nature of magnetic ﬁeld
in the prominence as can be clearly seen in 304˚A images
(dotted curves). Being clockwise skewed, the ﬁeld lines
(threads) are twisted in right hand direction with posi-
tive helicity (Figure 3)a. Note that ﬁeld line helicalness
is present well before the eruption but not as a conse-
quence of the eruption. Therefore, the system of promi-
nence and the enveloping stabilizing ﬁeld supports the
ﬂux rope models (e.g., Forbes & Isenberg 1991; Priest &

Forbes 2002; Roussev et al. 2003; T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005;
Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Zhang et al. 2012). Further, as
seen from footpoint F1, the entire prominence structure
is wound in clockwise direction, which is a signature of
magnetic writhe arising from excess twist.

After a careful examination of 304˚A movie, we sketch
the trace of the prominence and the embedded FR in Fig-
ure 3b for a possible magnetic conﬁguration. The back-
ground image HMI LOS magnetogram shows the mag-
netic connections of the prominence structure. Due to
projection, the ﬂux distribution appears very weak with
a ﬁeld strength less than 400G. The prominence appears
to be located in the periphery of the AR 12342 contain-
ing major negative polarity sunspot. Overall, the bipolar
distribution shows PIL along the projected length of the
prominence. The prominence footpoints F1 and F2 cor-
respond to positive and negative polarity respectively.

observations in AIA 304, 193, 131˚A pass bands. The chromospheric connections of prominence legs (F1, F2, F3) are clearly distinguishable
in Hα 01:14UT panel. In addition to core prominence, the AIA 193, 131˚A images also delineate the entrapping closed ﬁeld environment.
All panels are in heliographic coordinate system in arc second units.

As discussed earlier, the FR is intermigled with promi-
nence structure towards F1 and deviates from apex to-
wards negative polarity region F3. Being inclined to the
surface, the geometrical structure of FR is ambiguous
and indicates a low lying structure following curved PIL
below it.

As depicted in Figure 4, the FR exhibits a dynamical
evolution associated with the brightenings, pushing the

prominence upward and subsequently becomes an iso-
lated structure from a diﬀerent footpoint location be-
tween F1 and F2. While rising, both the prominence
and the FR stretch in length and the prominence exhibits
a rolling motion which is associated with the clockwise
rotation motion of the magnetic structure towards F1.
A section of the prominence is zoomed in the inset to
clearly indicate the presence of the right-helical threads.

twisted magnetic ﬂux threads, providing helicalness of magnetic ﬁeld. Also, as seen from F1, the entire magnetic structure winded in
right-hand, a signature of magnetic writhe, b) Trace of both prominence and the embedded MFR are plotted on LOS magnetogram.
Footpoints F1, F2, F3 are rooted in north, south, south polarity, respectively.

Since the footpoints of the prominence structure remain
attached to the surface (line-tied), the observed rotation
of magnetic structure is purely a consequence of transfor-
mation from (positive) writhe to (positive) twist of the
ﬁeldlines. Other possibilities, as discussed in Su & van
Ballegooijen (2013), related to twist increase by recon-
nection in the shared arcade, and/or untwisting of mag-
netic ﬁeld in the rising ﬂux rope during expansion and
relaxation can be ruled out because the observed con-
ditions are not supportive. Alternatively, we point that
the rotation of magnetic structure is also reported to be
driven by vortex motion of footpoints, which is clearly
not the case here, eﬃciently injecting twist into the coro-
nal magnetic structure (Bonet et al. 2010; Wedemeyer-
B¨ohm et al. 2012; Vemareddy et al. 2012a).

From these 304˚A images, we infer the half pitch length
(πp) of most observed helical tracers as 27Mm. And the
arc length (L) of the prominence at the time of its fast rise
(09/01:00UT, before expansion) is measured as 160Mm,
which is a typical value found in statistical studies (Wang
et al. 2010). With these observables, we deduce the num-
ber of turns (N = L
2πp , see Srivastava et al. 2010) that the
ﬁeld lines in the prominence body have is 2.96 (∼ 6π).
Because of this preexisted high twist number, the entire
prominence body is kinked (deformed), but still remains
in stable equilibrium presumably by the downward grav-
ity force of the entrapped mass and a strong strapping
eﬀect of the over-arching loops (Figure 1b).

3.3. Initiation mechanism
Initiation of the prominence rise commences from
09/00:00UT. The key information about the onset mech-
anism comes from AIA 1600˚A (C IV) images, which cap-

ture plasma emission from the upper photosphere and
transition region peaking at LogT [K] = 5.0 (Lemen et al.
2012). In Figure 5, we plotted the blended (diﬀerent pro-
portions of transparencies) AIA 1600 and 211˚A images at
diﬀerent epochs of the evolution. They clearly show dif-
ferent thermal conditions of the plasma across the promi-
nence body. Compact bright ﬂux threads belonging to
FR are illuminated in AIA 1600˚A images whereas the
surrounding twisted ﬂux threads, belonging to the main
prominence (see also Figure 3), are in a cool plasma envi-
ronment captured in 211˚A images. Similar to the recent
notion that more twisted ﬂux threads are illuminated in
hot passbands (Zhang et al. 2012), it implies that the ﬂux
threads from F3 are more compactly twisted than those
from F2. We regard this compact ﬂux thread (arrows in
Figure 5) as a distinct ﬂux rope, embedded in the large
scale prominence.

The compact ﬂux thread undergoes helical deformation
during the early activation period 00:00UT-00:40UT as
revealed by AIA 1600˚A images. The movie gives an im-
pression of right hand rotation of the apex, although the
handedness of ﬁeld line twist is not clear. Note that the
1600˚Aemission originates from around the central axis
of the prominence due to projection. During this pe-
riod, the enveloping prominence rises slowly with a reg-
istered outlier distorted shape in EUV observations. We
interpret this dynamical evolution of the embedded ﬂux
thread (or FR) as due to the helical kink instability, since
the magnetic twist exceeds the critical value (T¨or¨ok et al.
2004), and hence triggers the onset of prominence slow
rise. Importantly, the helical deformation related to the
kink instability in the FR needs to uplift the overlying
prominence, in addition to the entire closed ﬁeld envi-

ronment. Accounting for the smaller bulkiness of the FR
compared to the prominence, the FR instability leads
only to a slow upward lifting of the prominence over an
hour. Note that the ﬁeld lines enveloping the ﬂux thread
(belongs to main prominence) are also helical with right
handed (positive) twist, which are already at the theo-
retical critical value of the twist. As a result, the entire
prominence body is kinked (helically deformed) appear-
ing as S-shape morphology in projection.
It is worth
note that the exact amount of twist required for a kink
instability depends on several factors, including the loop
geometry and neighboring/overlying ﬁelds, but is gener-
ally agreed to be at least one full wind (Hood & Priest
1979; Baty 2001; T¨or¨ok et al. 2004).

In many well-observed cases, ﬂux systems with twists
exceeding the critical value undergo kinking and writhing
(see also the movie), with right (left) handed twist result-

ing in clockwise (anti-clockwise) apex rotation (Gilbert
et al. 2007; Alexander et al. 2006).
It is important to
point that the helical instability arises in FR with in-
dications of apex rotation that is not very clear in ob-
servations. With the observed dynamical activity of
the FR, the prominence rise is initiated from a preex-
isting marginal stability state (also see Discussion sec-
tion). With the onset of the rise motion, the promi-
nence exhibits rolling motion from FP2 to FP1. As a
consequence, the writhe (helical deformation of the axis)
converts to ﬁeldline twist (helicalness of the threads) as
per conservation of helicity. This writhe to twist trans-
formation is clearly indicated by the clockwise rotation
motion of the magnetic structure in the prominence leg
at F1 (Figure 4). To preserve the sign of the net helicity
content, the clockwise (positive) writhe gives right-hand
twist, which we see as the clockwise motion of the mag-

the cool prominence (211˚A) at one end and bifurcates from middle to a diﬀerent footpint location. Corresponding to the dynamic activity
of this ﬂux thread in time, similar to a kink unstable ﬂux rope, the entire prominence structure sets to slow upward motion. (also see

netic structure. We note the reconnection-related heat-
ing prevails mostly with the FR, which also supports our
presumption of two separate branches of ﬂux systems.

3.4. Plasma ﬂow in the prominence
To derive plasma ﬂow in the prominence structure, we
used the Diﬀerential Aﬃne Velocity Estimator (DAVE;
Schuck 2005) method on AIA 304˚A images of one minute
cadence. The method works on optical ﬂow principle to
detect transverse ﬂow velocity of features accounting for
contraction, dilation, and/or rotation. The procedure in-
volves induction equation expansion satisfying both con-
vection and advection models for a magnetoﬂuid. In our
case, a window of 15 pixels with advection is used to
derive the ﬂow velocity of the plasma.

In Figure 6, we show the plasma ﬂow velocity on AIA
304˚A images during the prominence slow rise. In diﬀer-
ent parts of the prominence, the ﬂow velocity exceeds
15km/s with diﬀerent ﬂow patterns, which is of the or-
der of slow rise velocity. The ﬂow vectors in the promi-
nence apex obviously indicate a net upward motion of
the prominence. Organized ﬂow vectors in the south leg,
indicated by a rectangular box, corresponds to clockwise
rotating motion as discussed earlier. The rotation mo-
tion is a process redistributing the twist of the ﬁeld lines
along the kinked prominence body. The derived plasma
ﬂow vectors captured this process remarkably during the
rolling and slow rise motions. The plasma drains down
along the threads in south leg as vector direction points

In order to capture further detailed
towards surface.
plasma ﬂow along the helical threads, high resolution
images are required, which are averaged in the tracking
window of AIA images.

3.5. Thermal properties
The thermal structure of the prominence is studied
with a diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) analysis us-
ing images in the six EUV channels of AIA. We used
xrt dem iterative2.pro, available in Solar Soft Ware
(SSW; Freeland & Handy 1998) package, with modiﬁ-
cations (Golub et al. 2004; Weber et al. 2004). The
code implements a forward ﬁtting procedure to construct
DEM at each pixel given its ﬂux and temperature re-
sponse function in each passband. Similar to earlier stud-
ies (Cheng et al. 2012; Vemareddy & Zhang 2014), we
constructed DEM maps of the prominence structure and
evaluated DEM-weighted average temperature ( ¯T ) and
thermal emission measure (EM) deﬁned as

¯T =

(cid:82) DEM (T )T dT
(cid:82) DEM (T ) dT ; EM =

(cid:90)

DEM (T ) dT

Integrations are evaluated over the temperature range
of 5.6 < logT < 7.3, which excludes the typical promi-
nence temperature of LogT = 4 . The temperature
and EM maps together with AIA 171˚A observations are
shown in Figure 7. The images are scaled appropriately
for a better contrast from the background emission. Till

Fig. 6.— Plasma ﬂow velocity (arrows) in the prominence. Organized ﬂow pattern in the south leg (rectangular box ) corresponds to
rotating motion, whereas those in the apex part corresponds to a net upward motion. Maximum length of arrows scales to 15km/s. Axis
units are in pixels of 0.6 arcsec size.

09/01:10UT, the EM and ¯T remain in orders of 27 and 6
respectively, as soon as activation ensues, both EM and
T increase by an order. We can notice the heated promi-
nence body with a better contrast (by an order) from the
background. The diameter of the prominence body be-
fore activation is 30Mm. Considering a mean EM value
of 5 × 1027cm−5 along the prominence body, the plasma
density (n = (cid:112)(EM/l)) comes out to be 1.29×109cm−3.
In order to study the time evolution, we further de-
rived DEM for the averaged intensity in 6 wavelength
band observations of the prominence at one-minute in-
tervals. To reduce the contribution of the background
emission, the chosen area minimally covers the promi-

nence in its entire rise motion. The light curves of this
average intensity are plotted in Figure 8(a). From these
light curves of diﬀerent wavebands, it is clear that the
background emission is dominant in the early rise phase
(before 01:15UT) compared to the later phase when the
prominence body expands to a maximum extent. Cor-
respondingly, the light curves show fall in their intensity
after 1:15UT in most AIA channels. Note that the in-
tensities are normalized to unity in each pass band, and
there exists excess emission in hot channels compared
to that of cold channels. It is indeed the case after the
prominence reached a certain height.

underneath rising ﬂuxrope (FR) is the source of heat-
ing (see AIA 304.mp4). Then the prominence appears in
hot channels due to the heated plasma emission and the
light curves recover from the dip after the onset of the
eruption.

The temperature dependence of DEM over time is plot-
ted in Figure 8(b) (see also Sun et al. 2014). The emis-
sion measure over the entire FOV varies in the range
1017−22cm−5. Its variation is about the mean tempera-
ture of 6.3MK, with major emission from low tempera-
tures in the early initiation phase, and dominant emis-
sion from high temperatures after the onset. This also
conﬁrms that the DEM is well constrained in the chosen
temperature range for valid observables (also see Cheng
et al. 2011; Vemareddy & Zhang 2014)

In Figure 8(c-d), we plot EM and ¯T derived by in-
tegrating the DEM in two temperature bands. One is
full temperature range 5.6 < LogT (K) < 7.3 and the
other is 5.6 < LogT (K) < 6.3 excluding the hotter emis-
sion. The later band is chosen to distinguish the promi-
nence from the background. Errors are deduced after
100 monte-carlo iteration runs of ﬁtting by introducing
errors to the input observations and are shown by verti-
cal bars. Over the entire temperature range, both ¯T and
EM show gradual increase(LogT:6.52-6.7, Log(EM):27.6-
27.7) since the onset of upward rise (00:40UT), which is
followed by a relatively high increase (up to factors of
6.9, 28) after the impulsive rise motion (1:15UT). The
fact that we see enhanced EM and ¯T while the light
curves in each band show sudden dip after 1:15UT is

due to a relatively intense ﬂux from hotter bands (193,
94, 131˚A) compared to the low temperature bands. It is
worth noting that after 1:20UT, the emission from PEA
contributes signiﬁcantly to ¯T and EM. However, in the
low temperature range, EM and ¯T varies about a mean
values, and a dip immediately after onset corresponds to
dip in light curves related to the dominant cool emission
from the prominence body. Since the sampling bands
are hotter than LogT = 5.6, the emission corresponds
to the prominence-corona transition region rather than

rising prominence and the FR are heated by progressive
reconnection upto 10MK.

3.6. Kinematic evolution
The erupted prominence appeared in the LASCO/C2
ﬁeld-of-view at 09/01:36UT and further in LASCO/C3
at 09/02:30UT. Since it is a limb event, the projec-
tion eﬀects have less inﬂuence in the derived kinematic
parameters. We derive the kinematic properties by
stacking the rectangular slit images obtained over the
CME/prominence evolution. In Figure 9(a-c), we show
the rectangular slits placed across the prominence/CME
apex. Their respective stack images are plotted in Fig-
ure 9(d-f). We then identiﬁed the bright feature corre-
sponding to the leading edge (LE) of the prominence in
AIA and the LE of the CME, core of the prominence
separately in LASCO observations (Gopalswamy et al.
2003).
In C2 stack plot, separate traces clearly corre-
spond to the LE and core. However, in the C3 stack

plot, both of these traces are visible in the early period
upto 04:30UT and become faint gradually. We carefully
followed these traces corresponding to the core and LE
and measured the position from the sun center for height
time history. The height-time history of the CME is also
given in the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog (Gopalswamy
et al. 2009). The LE had an average speed of 661 km/s
within the combined C2-C3 FOV1. and an average de-
celeration, -2.65 m/s2.

In Figure 9(g), we show the composite height-time plot
of the CME/prominence from AIA to LASCO/C3 ﬁelds-
of-view. Data points are ﬁtted with spline smoothing
procedure to minimize spikes in the measurements. The
velocity and acceleration are then derived. From them,
we show average acceleration value near the curves in the
same panel. During the activation period, the promi-
nence rises very slowly having a speed of 10-150km/s,
which corresponds to acceleration upto 0.9km/s2.
In
this phase, the prominence has an average acceleration
of 130m/s2 which essentially includes a slow average ac-
celeration of 18m/s2 upto 01:10UT before the fast rise.
In the LASCO FOV, both the CME LE and the promi-
nence core show nearly synchronous kinematic proﬁles,
indicating that the diﬀerent structures in the CME are

moving together. They contain fast and slow acceler-
ation stages in C2 and C3 height ranges. The LE at-
tained a peak velocity of 588km/s in C2 FOV, which was
slowed slightly to 573km/s in C3 FOV. However, this cor-
responds to signiﬁcant diﬀerence in average acceleration
(25.8m/s2, 2.6m/s2). The CME core has greater peak
velocity of 573km/s in C3 than in C2 of 523km/s.
It
has slightly higher average acceleration (28.9m/s2) than
CME LE. Thus in the outer coronagraph FOV, the CME
continued to accelerate as the case of Mar 11, 2012 CME
studied in Gopalswamy et al. (2015). Thus the kine-
matic study shows three stages of acceleration, slow, fast
and slow consistent with the general population of promi-
nence associated CMEs (Gopalswamy et al. 2003).

The synchronous kinematic proﬁles of CME LE and
core sheds some insights on the role of triggering mech-
anism on CME kinematics. The models that invoke FR
instability found a synchronized motion of CME LE and
the prominence (T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005) compared to those
explained by resistive instabilities like breakout or tether-
cutting models. For example, in a detailed study of a sim-
ulated breakout CME, Karpen et al. (2012) found that
the prominence-carrying portion of the structure moves
at Alfvenic speeds during the classic impulsive phase of
the CME/eruptive ﬂare, which then travels more slowly
than the CME front. This picture of kinematic prop-

CMEs (Mariˇci´c et al. 2009). Therefore, the identiﬁed
synchronous trajectory in our case also supports the FR
instability scenario.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
This work presents a detailed study of a prominence
eruption identifying the global magnetic structure and

the location of instability that led to the eruption. The
analysis shows that the identiﬁed instability occurs in a
ﬂux thread embedded in the prominence, despite both
are joined at one end. The AIA 1600˚A observations are
the key to identify the preeruptive dynamical activity of
the ﬂux thread in the prominence channel. The FR is
bifurcated at the apex of the prominence to a diﬀerent
footpoint location. Such cases are discovered in recent

12

studies, from the continuous AIA observations, as dou-
ble decker ﬁlaments (Vemareddy et al. 2012b; Liu et al.
2012; Vemareddy & Zhang 2014) when observed against
the disk. Depending on diﬀerent evolving conditions,
one of the branches will be subjected to instability. In
the case presented in Vemareddy & Zhang (2014), the
lower branch (although diﬃcult to determine in projec-
tion against the disk) is inferred to have FR character-
istics, and initiated to erupt by kink-instability. In the
present case, the onset mechanism is the helical kink-
instability that arose in the inner ﬂux system as an em-
bedded FR of the observed large scale prominence. The

DEM analysis characterizes the thermal emission and
temperature structure of the prominence-core transition
region. EM varies about mean temperature of 6.3MK,
with major emission from low temperature in the early
initiation phase, and dominant emission from high tem-
perature after the onset, suggesting reconnection related
heating in the later phase.

The associated CME moves at an average velocity of
545km/s in LASCO FOV, which is higher than the aver-
age value (475km/s) of the general population of CMEs
(Gopalswamy et al. 2003). Starting from an initial speed
of 10km/s, the CME moves away in slow, fast and slow
acceleration phases. The CME LE and core have aver-
age accelerations (25.8m/s2, 28.9m/s2) in C2 FOV. As a
typical behaviour of most CMEs associated with promi-
nences, the CME continues to accelerate in the outer
coronagraphic FOV.

In order to reveal the role of the background magnetic
ﬁeld in driving the eruption, we calculate the decay in-
dex n = − d log(Bh)
(Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006) of the hori-
d log h
zontal ﬁeld using potential ﬁeld source surface (PFSS)
code available in the SSW package. The code takes into
account the evolving ﬁeld on the full sphere by assimilat-
ing magnetograms into a ﬂux-dispersal model (Schrijver
& De Rosa 2003), and yields the coronal ﬁeld in spherical
coordinate system. After converting the ﬁeld to Carte-
sian coordinates, we calculate n at ten points along the
PIL below the prominence and plotted in Figure 10 as a
function of height from the solar surface. The error bars
are standard deviation of n at those 10 points. The curve
shows a bump at around 0.03R(cid:12) (20Mm), indicating that
the transverse ﬁeld in the low corona decreases rapidly
enough to allow an eruption to occur, which is consistent
with eruptive ﬂares for which the bump appears at 10Mm
in instantaneous local magnetograms (Cheng et al. 2011;
Vemareddy & Zhang 2014).

For the magnetograms of May 8 and 9, the theoretical
threshold of the torus instability, ncrit = 1.5 corresponds
to a height of 0.124, 0.151R(cid:12) respectively (sim105Mm).
Recall that the observed height of the extended closed
ﬁeld coronal environment is 110Mm (Figure 1b). The
dip in the curve (20-40Mm) can also be understood in
terms of the coronal ﬁeld conﬁguration and its strength
in constraining the prominence eruption. Recent studies
point to the signiﬁcant role of low-altitude ﬁeld strength,
and asymmetric ﬁeld conﬁguration in the conﬁnement
of prominence/ﬁlaments (Liu et al. 2009). A study by
Liu (2008) reports that the low-altitude ﬁeld strength
for failed eruptions is three times stronger than that
for full eruption cases. In the present case, the promi-
nence is lying horizontal to the surface and experiences
strong conﬁnement by the low-lying loops along the PIL,
causing very slow rise motion of the prominence in the
early phase despite being with critically twisted threads.
This is how the prominence achieves near stability dur-
ing 00:40UT-01:10UT even after introducing the insta-
bility with a large twist and is likely the regime of failed
eruptions of kink-unstable ﬁlaments as indicated in Liu
(2008). After crossing this elevated point, the promi-
nence stretches vertically with material draining down,
which accommodates the growth of the instability in the
ﬁeld of symmetric extended coronal loops up to 105Mm.
Altogether, the conﬁnement of the background ﬁeld is in
agreement with the height time (Figure 9) plot showing
the slow upward motion of the prominence up to 105Mm
(1:15UT) in AIA ﬁeld of view. This is the height range
in which the prominence rises under the inﬂuence of the
kink-instability against the background ﬁeld.

As soon as the prominence crosses this height, the self
force drives further eruption because the rapidly decay-

Prominence eruption by helical kink instability

13

ing closed ﬁeld can no more suppress the rise motion.
Recent observations indicate that the critical height for
torus stability is as high as 236Mm (Wang et al. 2017),
that in order to suppress the further eruption triggered
by kink instability. For a conﬁned eruption studied by
Guo et al. (2010), the n lies always below 101Mm be-
fore reaching the ncrit, suggesting a stronger restraining
ﬁeld over the ﬂux rope. While there is a dividing line
of n for failed and successful eruptions, the height of
ncrit depends on background ﬁeld strength which is dif-
ferent for diﬀerent cases. Also depending on the magni-
tude of erupting core ﬁeld related to hoop/self force, con-
ﬁned/ejective eruption is realised. For example, a kink-
unstable ﬁlament ascent is terminated within a projected
height of 80Mm to a failed eruption following M2.2 ﬂare

(Ji et al. 2003), however a similar kink-unstable ﬁlament
from AR 10696 rises to about 70Mm which subsequently
manifests as a fast CME (Williams et al. 2005).
