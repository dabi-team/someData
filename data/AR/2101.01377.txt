Abstract:  The  resonance  band  in  hollow-core  photonic  crystal  fiber  (HC-PCF),  while  leading  to 
high-loss  region  in  the  fiber  transmission  spectrum,  has  been  successfully  used  for  generating 
phase-matched  dispersive  wave  (DW).  Here,  we  report  that  the  spectral  width  of  the 
resonance-induced DW can be largely broadened due to plasma-driven blueshifting soliton. In the 
experiment,  we  observed  that  in  a  short  length  of  Ar-filled  single-ring  HC-PCF  the  soliton 
self-compression and photoionization effects caused a strong spectral blueshift of the pump pulse, 
changing the phase-matching condition of the DW emission process. Therefore, broadening of DW 
spectrum  to  the  longer-wavelength  side  was  obtained  with  several  spectral  peaks,  which 
correspond  to  the  generation  of  DW  at  different  positions  along  the  fiber.  In  the  simulation,  we 
used  super-Gauss  windows  with  different  central  wavelengths  to  filter  out  these  DW  spectral 
peaks,  and  studied  the  time-domain  characteristics  of  these  peaks  respectively  using  Fourier 
transform method. The simulation results verified that these multiple-peaks on the DW spectrum 
have  different  delays  in  the  time  domain,  agreeing  well  with  our  theoretical  prediction. 
Remarkably, we found that the whole time-domain DW trace can be compressed to ~29 fs using 
proper chirp compensation. The experimental and numerical results reported here provide some 
insight into the resonance-induced DW generation process in gas-filled HC-PCFs, they could also 
pave the way to ultrafast pulse generation using DW-emission mechanism.

1. Introduction 

Phase-matched  dispersive  wave  (DW),  arising  from  a  nonlinear  energy  transfer  from  a 
self-compressed  soliton,  has  attracted  great  research  interests  in  the  past  few  decades  [1-4].  In 
particular, the low-loss broadband-guiding gas-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (HC-PCFs), 
as ideal platforms, are widely used for studying the efficient generation of tunable phase-matched 
DW [5-7]. The phase-matched DW can not only be generated in a wide wavelength range such as 
ultraviolet  (UV)  [8]  and  mid-infrared  (MIR)  spectral  regions  [9],  but  its  wavelength  can  also  be 
effectively  tuned,  which  makes  this  kind  of  light  sources  have  many  applications,  especially  in 
ultrafast spectroscopy. 

  In  the  gas-filled  HC-PCFs,  the  combined  effects  of  self-compressed  soliton  and  high-order 
dispersion can result in phase-matched DW generated in the UV region [5,7]. As early as ten years 
ago,  Joly  et  al.  demonstrated  the  efficient  emission  of  DW  in  the  deep-UV  region  by  using  an 
Ar-filled kagomé-style HC-PCF [8]. The generated bright spatially coherent deep-UV laser source is 

 
 
tunable from 200 to 320 nm through varying the pulse energy and gas pressure. Belli et al. used a 
short  length  of  hydrogen-filled  kagomé-style  HC-PCF  to  develop  the  generation  of  vacuum-UV 
(VUV)  to  near-infrared  (NIR)  supercontinuum  [10].  The experimental  result showed that  a  strong 
VUV DW emission generated at  182 nm on  the  trailing edge  of  the  pulse, and  it also  proved  that 
kagomé-style  HC-PCF  works  well  in  the  VUV  spectral  region.  Simultaneously,  Ermolov  et  al. 
reported  on  the  generation  of  a  three-octave-wide  supercontinuum  from  VUV  to  NIR  region  in  a 
He-filled kagomé-style HC-PCF  [11].  The  VUV pulses  generated  through DW emission  is tunable 
from 120 to 200 nm, with efficiencies >1% and VUV pulse energy >50 nJ. It should be pointed out 
that in the strong-field regime, the plasma caused by gas ionization modifies the fiber dispersion, 
allowing  phase-matched  DW  generation  in  the  MIR  region.  Novoa  et  al.  first  predicted  the 
generation  of  MIR  DW,  and  established  a  new  model  to  explain  it  well  [12].  Köttig  et  al.  first 
experimentally  demonstrated  the  existence  of  MIR  DW  and  realized  a  4.7-octave-wide 
supercontinuum from 180 nm to 4.7 µm, with up to 1.7 W of total average power [9]. 

The  phase-matched  DW  can  not  only  be  generated  in  the  UV  and  MIR  spectral  regions,  but 
also in the visible and NIR regions. Sollapur et al. experimentally reported on the  generation of a 
three-octave-wide  supercontinuum  from  200  nm  to  1.7  µm  at  an  output  energy  of  ~23  µJ  in  a 
Kr-filled  HC-PCF  [13].  Simulations  showed  that  the  spectra  generated  in  the  visible  and  NIR 
resonance  bands  are  closely  related  to  the  emission  of  the  phase-matched  DW.  Tani  et  al.  further 
proved  that  the  narrow-band  spectral  peaks  generated  in  the  resonance  bands  are  based  on  the 
phase-matched  DW  emission  due  to  the  anti-crossing  dispersion  [14].  Recently,  Meng  et  al. 
demonstrated  the  generation  of  NIR  DW  in  the  resonance  bands  of  an  Ar-filled  kagomé-style 
HC-PCF  [15].  In  our  recent  experiments  [16,17],  we  reported  the  high-efficiency  emission  of 
phase-matched DW in the visible spectral region using a He-filled single-ring (SR) HC-PCF. As the 
input pulse energy increases, the central wavelength of the plasma-driven blueshifting soliton (BS) 
[18,19]  is  close  to  the  resonance  band  of  the  fiber,  high-efficiency  energy  transfer  from  the  pump 
light to the DW can be triggered. 

In this work, we demonstrated in the experiments that the photoionization-induced broadband 
DW in a 25-cm-long Ar-filled SR HC-PCF. In a certain pulse energy region, we observed that soliton 
self-compression of the input pulse results in a spectral expansion that overlaps with resonant DW 
frequencies,  leading  to  a  narrow-band  DW  spectral  peak  in  the  first  resonance  band  of  the  SR 
HC-PCF.  At  high  pulse  energy  levels,  we  observed  that  the  plasma-driven  BS  can  further  excite 
multiple DW peaks, which leads to the broadening of DW spectrum to the longer-wavelength side. 
In  addition,  we  theoretically  investigated  the  time-domain  characteristics  of  these  spectral  peaks 
filtered  by  the  super-Gauss  windows  using  Fourier  transform  method,  and  compressed  the  DW 
pulses to ~29 fs through suitable dispersion compensation. 

2. Experimental Set-up 

The  experimental  set-up  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  800  nm,  ~45  fs,  0.3  mJ  pulses  from  a 
commercial  Ti:Sapphire  laser  system  were  coupled  into  a  1-m-long  hollow-core  fiber  (HCF)  by 
using a concave mirror with a focal length of 1 m. The HCF has a core diameter of 250 µm and was 
placed  in  a  gas  cell  filled  with  212  mbar  Ar.  The  spectrum  of  the  pulses  after  propagating  the 
Ar-filled  HCF  was  broadened  due  to  self-phase  modulation  (SPM),  and  the  energy  transmission 
was  measured  to  be  ~70%.  Several  pairs  of  chirped  mirrors  (CMs)  were  not  only  used  to 
compensate the output pulses from the  gas-filled HCF, but also to pre-compensate the dispersion 
introduced by some optical elements, including half-wave plate (HWP), wire grid polarizer (WGP), 
and even plano-convex lens (PCL) and the window at the input port of the second gas cell. Then the 
compressed pulses were launched into a 25-cm-long SR HC-PCF filled with 1.4 bar Ar using a coated 
PCL with a focal length of 0.1 m. The insert indicates the scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the 
SR HC-PCF that has a core diameter of 24 µm and a wall thickness of ~0.26 µm.

The phase-matched DW is usually generated in the positive direction of the time axis. In Fig. 
5(a),  we  used  a  super-Gauss  window  to  filter  out  the  leftmost  DW  spectral  band  (marked  as  red 
dashed line, called DW-SB1), and the green solid line corresponds to the simulated spectrum at the 
output of the SR HC-PCF with the input pulse energy of 2.6 µJ.  Through  the  Fourier  transform  of 
DW-SB1, the corresponding temporal profile in Fig. 5(b) is located on the right side of the time axis 
and shows a long pulse duration of ~198 fs at FWHM due to a narrow spectral width. However, the 
plasma-driven  BS  located  in  the  anomalous  dispersion  region  has  a  higher  group  velocity  than 
input pulses, so  that  the  blueshifting pulses  accelerate as  the  propagation distance  increases. This 
causes  the  DW  radiation  to  approach  the  zero  point  of  the  time  axis,  and  even  appear  in  the 
negative  direction,  as  shown  in  Figs.  5(c)-5(f).  The  pulse  durations  corresponding  to  the  DW-SB2 
and DW-SB3 are ~171 fs and ~36 fs, respectively. In Fig. 5(h), we also plot the temporal intensity of 
BS  [see  Fig.  5(g)],  and  the  pulse  duration  is  about  13  fs.  Figure  5(j)  shows  the  complete  temporal 
profile of the output pulses. The main peak is the BS, and its peak position is about 44 fs, consistent 
with  Fig.  5(h).  In  addition,  the  left  side  of  the  main  peak  is  the  existing  pedestal  of  the  incident 
pulses  [see  Fig.  2(e)],  while  the  oscillations  on the  right  are  the  DW  radiation  and  residual  pump 
light. The self-compressed pulse duration can be as short as ~6 fs. These results can also be observed 
in Fig. 4(j). 

Figure 5. The green solid lines represent the simulated spectrum output of a 25-cm-long SR HC-PCF 
at an input energy of 2.6 µJ. In (b), (d), (f) and (h), the orange solid lines indicate the temporal profiles 
of the pulses through Fourier transforming the spectral bands (marked as red dashed lines) filtered 
by  super-Gauss  windows,  and  in  (j),  the  temporal  profile  of  the  pulse  obtained  by  Fourier 
transforming the entire output spectrum. In (a), (c) and (e), DW-SB = dispersive wave spectral band. 

Figure 6(a) shows the broadband DW spectrum filtered from the output spectrum of Fig. 5(i) 
through  using  a  super-Gauss  window  from  550  nm  to  610  nm,  and  the  corresponding  temporal 
profile after the Fourier transform is plotted in Fig. 6(b). Although the pulse duration at FWHM is 
~30  fs,  the  pulses  exhibit  long-decay  pedestals  on  the  trailing  edge  due  to  the  DW  radiation 
generated  at  different  positions  in  the  fiber.  We  found  that  after  -4634  fs2  group  delay  dispersion 
(GDD)  and  -44827  fs3  third-order  dispersion  (TOD)  compensation,  these  pedestals  can  be 
compressed into the main peak, showing a clean pulse leading edge. The compressed pulse duration 
is ~29 fs, which is very close to the Fourier transform limit (FTL) of ~24 fs.
