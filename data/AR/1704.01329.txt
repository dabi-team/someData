Abstract

We report on discharge probability studies with a single Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) under irradiation with alpha particles in
Ar- and Ne-based gas mixtures. The discharge probability as a function of the GEM absolute gain is measured for various distances
between an alpha source and the GEM. We observe that the discharge probability is the highest when the charge deposit occurs in
the closest vicinity of the GEM holes, and that the breakdown limit is lower for argon mixtures than for neon mixtures.

Our experimental ﬁndings are in line with the well-grounded hypothesis of the charge density being the limiting factor of GEM
stability against discharges. A detailed comparison of the measurements with GEANT4 simulations allowed us to extract the critical
charge density leading to the formation of a spark in a GEM hole. This number is found to be within the range of (5 − 9) × 106
electrons after ampliﬁcation, and it depends on the gas mixture.

1. Introduction

The requirements of a new generation of experiments in
particle physics determine the development of new detectors.
Novel devices must handle the envisaged high luminosities as
well as a substantial increase in active detector area. Among
the innovative detector techniques, Micro-Pattern Gaseous De-
tectors (MPGD), and in particular the Gas Electron Multiplier
(GEM) [1], have become a widely used technology for high-
rate experiments like COMPASS [2, 3], LHCb [4] or TOTEM
[5, 6] and are foreseen for new experiments or upcoming up-
grades, such as sPHENIX [7] or the upgraded ALICE TPC
[8, 9]. The key aspects for long-term operation of such detec-
tors in the harsh environment of high-rate experiments are radi-
ation hardness, ageing resistance and stability against electrical
discharges. In particular, the latter may pose a threat to the in-
tegrity of the GEM foil, as they may cause irreversible damages
to the detector, ranging from enhanced leakage currents to per-
manent electric short circuits that render the detector eﬀectively
blind.

In studies with parallel-plate counters [10], breakdown has
been measured to occur when the total charge in the avalanche
exceeds a critical value of the order of 108 electron–ion pairs
(the so-called Raether limit). Correspondingly, an avalanche
size of O(107) electron-ion pairs is expected to be the limiting
factor of the micro-pattern gaseous detectors stability against
electrical discharges [11].

Typical high-rate capabilities considered for GEM-based
trackers are of the order of 1 MHz/cm2 [2, 3, 4, 6]. Taking into

account the geometry of such detectors (few mm drift gaps) and
gas mixtures (Ar-based), a single MIP-like particle impinging
on the detector plane creates an average primary charge den-
sity of a few electrons per cm2. Even at these rates, taking into
account the electron drift time, no pile-up is expected. The re-
sulting primary charge density is far below the stability limits,
even if multiplied by typical gain values of O(104) at which
such detectors are operated. However, the occurrence of high
charge densities, possibly produced by the presence of highly
ionising particles in the closest vicinity of the GEM foil, may
signiﬁcantly alter the stability of the detector. Indeed, an alpha
particle may liberate up to 104 more electrons per cm than a
MIP.

So far, the only comprehensive discharge studies with single
and multiple GEM detectors exposed to highly-ionising alpha
particles were reported in [12] and concern mainly Ar-based
gas mixtures. By sharing the ampliﬁcation process between
two or more successive GEMs, the maximum sustainable gain
is shifted upward by several orders of magnitude. The charge
spread during the transport between adjacent foils dilutes the
charge densities approaching the last ampliﬁcation stage.

There are several ways to distribute the voltages among all
electrodes in a multi-GEM set-up. According to [12], where the
detector stability was studied using an external alpha source, the
most stable HV conﬁguration features an asymmetric choice of
potential diﬀerences across the GEM electrodes, in which the
highest ampliﬁcation occurs in the ﬁrst foil in the stack and suc-
cessively decreases towards the readout anode. Such a conﬁgu-
ration has been successfully used in the GEM-based trackers of
COMPASS [2, 3].

The experience of the LHCb experiment at CERN-LHC
with their triple GEM detectors points towards a reduction of

the gain by lowering the voltages applied to the ﬁrst two am-
pliﬁcation stages to the level of the third GEM in a stack [13].
Such a symmetric distribution helps to eliminate the occurrence
of fatal discharges in the ﬁrst GEM of a stack due to (what is
believed to be) neutrons converting in the detector material.

In case the application demands for a diﬀerent conﬁguration
of the potentials applied to the electrodes, the stability of the de-
tector may become compromised. For the application of GEMs
in a TPC, the suppression of the ion back-ﬂow is crucial in or-
der to keep the distortions of the drift ﬁeld by the back drifting
ions at a tolerable level (see e.g. [14] and references therein).
A typical suppression of the ion feedback is conducted by sub-
sequently increasing the gain of each GEM foil in the stack
towards the readout anode, as in this scenario ions created in
the inner layers are blocked more eﬃciently. The strong ampli-
ﬁcation in the last stage, in combination with the pre-ampliﬁed
charges from the upper GEMs may enhance the probability of
reaching the critical amount of charge and thus signiﬁcantly al-
ter the stability with respect to electrical discharges.

In all scenarios, the overall stability is driven by the prob-
ability of encountering a discharge in any of the GEMs. This
clearly demand for further studies of the intrinsic stability of
GEM-based detectors. Of particular interest are therefore mea-
surements of the breakdown limits which can be obtained in a
single-GEM detector, which will allow for the extrapolation of
the results to the situation in an arbitrary stack operated under
any HV settings. By measuring the stability of the simplest con-
ﬁguration, including only one GEM foil, the intrinsic stability
of the GEM foil against electrical discharges can be extracted
independently from eﬀects as the presence of transfer ﬁelds or
charge sharing and spreading between the foils.

In this paper we intend to determine critical charge limits
for a Gas Electron Multiplier by irradiating a single-GEM de-
tector with alpha particles. The studies are performed in Ne-
and Ar-based gas mixtures to investigate the inﬂuence of basic
gas properties on the detector stability.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces
the experimental setup and the main properties of the employed
gas mixtures. The measurements and their interpretation are
described in Sec. 3. Section 4 describes the simulation frame-
work and the corresponding analysis procedure which allow to
extract ﬁnal values of the critical charge density. Section 5 con-
cludes the paper with a summary of the main ﬁndings.

2. Experimental setup

2.1. GEM detector

A prototype was prepared to study the stability of single
GEM foils against electrical discharges. Figure 1 shows a sche-
matic drawing and the powering scheme of this setup.

The detector vessel contains a 10×10 cm2 GEM holder, a
drift cathode and a readout anode. Both the cathode and the
anode are made of a 1.5 mm thick PCB coated on one side with
copper (∼10×10 cm2).
In the middle of the cathode plate, a
7.8 mm diameter hole allows to irradiate the GEM plane with a
radioactive source. A single GEM foil is installed 2 mm above

discharge probability studies.

the readout plane. The GEM foil, produced at the CERN PCB
workshop with the double-mask technology, is of standard de-
sign: 50 µm thick polyimide (Apical) covered on both sides
with 5 µm layers of copper, with 50 µm (70 µm) inner (outer)
hole diameter and a pitch of 140 µm. The drift gap length (dis-
tance between the cathode and the GEM stack) can be adjusted
between 10 and 77 mm.

Two voltages are applied to the detector: a cathode potential
Ucat and, through a 10 MΩ protection resistor, a GEM potential
Utop. Both voltages are applied using two independent channels
of an ISEG EHS F060n 6 kV unit. A 5 MΩ resistor to ground
for the top GEM electrode is chosen to ensure a safe and fast
discharge of the GEM after a power supply trip. The bottom
side of the GEM is kept at ground potential.

Ucat and Utop deﬁne the drift ﬁeld Edrift above the GEM
and the potential diﬀerence across the GEM foil ∆UGEM (see
Fig. 1). A drift ﬁeld of 400 V/cm, used for all measurements
presented in this work, matches the value of the drift ﬁeld planned
for the upgraded ALICE TPC [8, 9]. The choice of Edrift de-
ﬁnes the drift properties in a given gas, which are discussed in
Sec. 2.3. The value of the induction ﬁeld (Eind) between the
bottom side of the GEM and the grounded readout anode is set
equal to zero in order to measure the absolute gain of the GEM
foil (see Sec. 2.4 for more details) and to decouple the eﬀect of
the induction ﬁeld on the discharges at the GEM.

The occurrence of a spark in the GEM foil is detected em-
ploying the readout scheme shown in Fig. 1. The signal in-
duced on the pad plane is processed by a discriminator unit.
The threshold of the discriminator is set to a few hundreds of a
mV to ﬁlter out signals induced by alpha particles and to trigger
on discharge signals with a much higher amplitude (a typical
discharge signal is displayed in Fig. 2).

The signal waveform shows modulations which are due to
the inductance of the system, resulting in periodic oscillations.
Therefore, a gate of O(100 µs) is opened when the discriminator
threshold is exceeded. A scaler registers the resulting counts. It
should be noted that with this procedure no dead-time is intro-
duced to the measurement (see Sec. 3.1 for details).

ous works [12], Ar-CO2 (90-10), Ne-CO2 (90-10) and the AL-
ICE TPC mixture Ne-CO2-N2 (90-10-5)1 [16]. Table 2 sum-
marises the basic properties of the gas mixtures. Electron drift
velocity (vd), longitudinal (DL) and transverse (DT) diﬀusion
coeﬃcients, and eﬀective ionisation potentials (Wi) are evalu-
ated using Magboltz [17], whereas the approximate value of the
maximum range (rα) of an alpha particle from the mixed radia-
tion source in a given gas mixture was extracted using GEANT
simulations (see Sec. 4.1 for more details).

2.4. Absolute gain determination

All discharge probability measurements presented here have
been performed as a function of the GEM absolute gain Gabs.
For the characterisation of a GEM foil, the diﬀerence is made
between the GEM absolute gain and the so-called eﬀective gain
Geﬀ = (cid:15)coll ×Gabs ×(cid:15)extr, where (cid:15)coll and (cid:15)extr are the electron col-
lection and extraction eﬃciencies, respectively. According to
our FEM calculations using the COMSOL Multiphysics R(cid:13) soft-
ware [18] the drift ﬁeld of 400 V/cm used in all the measure-
ments assures 100 % collection eﬃciency for primary electrons
In order to allow for a proper inter-
reaching the GEM foil.
pretation of the measurements, the latter are conducted at zero
induction ﬁeld in order to avoid any bias introduced by a possi-
ble focussing eﬀect which eﬀectively enhances the local charge
density inside the hole and accordingly increases the discharge
probability. With Eind = 0 the extraction eﬃciency to the pad
plane (cid:15)extr = 0, which means that all electrons produced in the
avalanche process are collected at the bottom side of the GEM
foil. Measuring the ampliﬁcation current at this electrode, how-
ever, corresponds to a situation in which all electrons are read
out and we thus ﬁnd Gabs = Geﬀ. The absolute gain of the GEM
is evaluated as the ratio of the ampliﬁcation current measured
at the bottom electrode of the GEM to the primary ionisation
current, created by the ionisation in the drift volume of the de-
tector. The latter is measured at the top GEM electrode (keep-
ing ∆UGEM = 0 and the bottom GEM electrode grounded) at
the nominal drift ﬁeld. The radiation source used in these stud-
ies (see Sec. 2.2) generates primary currents in the range of
10 to 20 pA. The measurement is performed using a Keithley
Instruments Model 6517B Electrometer in a low-noise environ-
ment provided by a shielding box surrounding the experimental
setup. The ﬁnal value of primary current is corrected for resid-
ual currents (oﬀset) measured before applying potential to the
electrodes.

Figure 3 shows typical GEM absolute gain values measured
as a function of the potential diﬀerence across the foil for the
four gas mixtures. It should be noted that the values of the abso-
lute gain are very high for single GEMs as the detector was op-
erated at high voltages in order to induce measurable discharge
rates. We consider the gain to follow an exponential behaviour
in the limited range of interest. Therefore, the gain curves are
ﬁtted with an exponential function in order to extrapolate or in-
terpolate the absolute gain value to the region where no data
points are available.

1The gas ratio should be normalised to the sum of all components, which

corresponds to (85.7-9.5-4.8) in standard notation.

setup, attenuated by 30 dB.

2.2. Radiation source

For the reported discharge studies, an alpha-emitting mixed
nuclide source is used which consists of 239Pu, 241Am and 244Cm.
The energies of the respective alpha particles emitted by the dif-
ferent constituents are summarised in Tab. 1.

The active material of the source is deposited on a coin-like
area in a form of an 8 mm diameter circle. To determine the rate
of the source, an ADC spectrum of alpha particles is recorded
within a given time and the background is subtracted. The re-
maining counts determine the rate R, which is R ≈ 600 Hz.
The rate is measured after each positioning of the source on the
cathode or each modiﬁcation of the drift gap length.

The discharge probability is deﬁned by the ratio of the dis-

charge rate to the measured source rate:

the high-rate measurements, we do not continue measurements
for spark rates larger than ∼1.5 Hz and, correspondingly, dis-
charge probabilities higher than ∼3 × 10−3.

The measurement of a single point on Fig. 4 takes no longer
than two hours in order to avoid large gain variations due to at-
mospheric conditions. It should be noted that the gain curve
is obtained before each measurement session (deﬁned by a gas
mixture anddsource). The latter is then accomplished within sev-
eral hours after the gain is evaluated to assure the validity of the
multiplication values throughout the complete session.

The discharge probability depends strongly on the gas mix-
ture and the diﬀerences are most prominent for the Ar-CO2 and
Ne-CO2 (90-10) mixtures for which the amount of quencher is
the same. For these two gases, the measurements have been car-
ried out for four diﬀerent values of dsource. For a given gain, the
discharge probability in Ar-CO2 (90-10) is higher by several
orders of magnitude than in Ne-CO2 (90-10). The diﬀerence
can be explained by basic features of the corresponding noble
gas. The range of alpha particles in the Ar-based mixture is al-
most 40 % shorter compared to the Ne-based. Additionally, the
number of primary electrons liberated by the incident particle
is higher in Argon due to the lower value of the eﬀective ion-
isation potential (see Table 2 for details). Accordingly, higher
local charge densities are obtained in Ar-based gas mixtures.
As a consequence, it is more likely to exceed the critical charge
limit and hence the discharge probability may be eﬀectively en-
hanced.

For dsource = 3.95 cm the discharge curves were measured
for all four mixtures. Both Ar-based mixtures have lower break-
down limits than any of the Ne-based. Concerning the addition
of a small fraction of N2 to Ne-CO2 (90-10), the larger amount
of quencher clearly enhances the stability of the mixture, while
the transport properties remain almost unaﬀected, as discussed
in [23]. A similar argument can be used to interpret the re-
sults with the Ar-CO2 (70-30) mixture. The larger amount of
quencher increases the stability of the GEM, however, taking
into account the alpha range and the eﬀective ionisation poten-
tial of this gas, one would expect similar charge densities and
thus discharge probability as in the 90-10 mixture. Therefore,
the resulting diﬀerence can be assigned to the diﬀerent transport
properties in this mixture, which accordingly alter the density
of primary ionisation.

It is worth noting that there are no discharge curves mea-
sured in Ar-CO2 (90-10) for higher values of dsource. The rea-
son for that is that the discharge probability for larger distances

3. Discharge probability in a single GEM

3.1. Gas mixture dependence

Figure 4 shows the discharge probability measured as a func-
tion of the GEM absolute gain for diﬀerent distances dsource be-
tween the source and the GEM foil.

The values of discharge probability spread over several or-
ders of magnitude for measurements at a given distance. With
the source rate of ∼600 Hz, the measurement of the probability
values higher than 10−3 is experimentally diﬃcult as the corre-
sponding discharge rate is higher than 1 Hz. The average time
between discharges is thus close to the system dead-time of
∼200 ms, which is the time needed after a discharge to restore
the nominal value of ∆UGEM across the GEM. The measured
value of discharge probability may thus be underestimated, as
the detector is not operated at full voltage. To correct for this ef-
fect we assume the spark occurrence undergoes a Poisson distri-
bution and, for the measured spark rate, calculate the probabil-
ity to encounter a discharge within a time interval correspond-
ing to the detector’s dead-time. For discharge rates of 1 Hz the
resulting probability is ∼16 % (at the level of the statistical er-
ror) which is also the measure of how much the ﬁnal discharge
probability is underestimated. For lower discharge rates the cor-
rections are negligible. In order to avoid major corrections to

quently no discharges can be measured within a reasonable amount
of time with a source rate of ∼600 Hz. It is therefore relevant
to look into the dependence on the distance between the source
and the GEM foil in more details.

3.2. dsource dependence

As there is no single gain value for which the discharge
probability is measured at all distances, the experimental re-
sults presented in Fig. 4 are ﬁtted with an exponential func-
tion (not shown in the ﬁgure) to extra-/interpolate the discharge
probability to the gain values of interest. The validity of this
approach was tested by comparing the such obtained values to
the measured data where possible. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences
were found within the uncertainties.

Figure 5 shows the discharge probability measured as a func-
tion of the distance dsource for a given absolute gain of 575 and
1375 for Ar-CO2 (90-10) and Ne-CO2 (90-10), respectively.
The measured dependencies indicate a monotonical increase of
the discharge probability with dsource. Beyond a certain distance
(∼5 cm and ∼7 cm for Ar- and Ne-CO2, respectively) the dis-
charge probability drops abruptly by several orders of magni-
tude such that only upper limits can be measured. The upper
limit is deﬁned as 1/ (tR), where t is the measurement time in
which no discharge has been recorded. It should be noted, that
the upper limits are measured for up to 30 hours at gains higher
than indicated in Fig. 5 which allow us to neglect possible gain
variations due to change of atmospheric conditions.

The distinctive behaviour of the measured dependence can
be interpreted in the following way. An enhanced discharge
probability is expected when alpha particles can pass through
the GEM holes or are stopped in their closest vicinity, which in
both cases yields the highest local primary charge densities in
single holes. When the distance is increased such that the al-
phas do no longer reach the GEM structure the discharge prob-
ability drops by orders of magnitude. Even though the primary
ionisation still reaches the GEMs due to the charge transport
in the drift ﬁeld, the resulting charge density is then already
signiﬁcantly diluted by diﬀusion and will therefore have less
probability to create a discharge.

The local energy deposit of the alpha particle is signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced towards the end of its trajectory, which is man-
ifested by an increase of the discharge probability with increas-
ing dsource values. In our case, however, this eﬀect is convoluted
with the emission of the particle within a solid angle element
deﬁned by the ﬁnite source dimensions and the hole in the cath-
ode PCB (see Sec. 2 for more details). Due to this complica-
tion, a simple comparison of the discharge curves in Fig. 5 to
the Bragg curve is not possible. Therefore, we employ full-
scale GEANT4 simulations of the setup, which allows us to
explicitly compute the local energy deposit. In order to further
verify the charge density hypothesis, we estimate the resulting
charge density after the drift inside single GEM holes with the
aim to obtain the critical charge limit responsible for the for-

been performed in [21].

4. Simulations

4.1. Detector simulation

For the simulation of the energy deposit in the active de-
tector medium, we use the latest version of GEANT4 (4.10.2)
[19], which is a commonly used tool for the simulation of in-
teractions of charged particles traversing matter in high-energy
physics. The particle transport in GEANT4 is performed step-
wise with an interaction taking place after each step. The dis-
tance between the steps is randomly sampled from the mean
free path of the particle computed taking into account the cross
sections of speciﬁed physics processes, which are summarised
in a so-called physics list. Among the recommended physics
lists for low-energetic applications [20], we employ G4EmLiver-
morePhysics in the course of our studies.

The description of the setup follows closely the geometry
of the detectors described in Sec. 2. A particle gun on the cath-
ode randomly emits alpha particles with energies and intensities
corresponding to the speciﬁcations of the mixed alpha-source as
summarised in Table 1. The eﬀect of the drift ﬁeld in the ac-
tive volume is included in the simulation, however without con-
sidering inhomogeneities resulting from the missing ﬁeld cage.
The resulting bias is found to be negligible. The exact position
and energy deposit of each individual GEANT4 hit is then used
in the further analysis steps. In total, about 500 million events
are simulated and processed for each gas which is suﬃcient to
compare the outcome of the simulation to the whole range of
measured discharge probabilities.

Of particular interest for the formation of discharges is the
energy deposit of the alpha-particles in the closest vicinity of
the GEM foil and the accordingly obtained charge densities in-
side single GEM holes. While the discharge itself is a fast phe-
nomenon taking place on time scales O(ns), it is not known how
long it takes to create the conditions in which a discharge can
develop, i.e. how long the charges can accumulate inside the
GEM hole before a discharge occurs. This time is linked to the
exact mechanism underlying the discharge formation and could
thus be used to diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent possible scenar-
ios, such e.g.
the accumulation of ion space charge. There-
fore, we introduce the integration time tint as a parameter in our
model.

The number of ionisation electrons is obtained by dividing
the energy deposit of each GEANT4 hit by the eﬀective ionisa-
tion energy Wi, which is depicted together with all other rele-
vant gas parameters in Table 2. All ionisation electrons located
dint = tint · vdrift above the GEM plane are then projected onto
the latter. Transverse and longitudinal diﬀusion is taken into
account by smearing the respective widths of the electron cloud
by Gaussian distributions according to the values reported in
Table 2. The electrons are then sorted into the honeycomb-like
grid of the GEM foil, taking into account the collection eﬃ-
ciency of the GEM which is 100 % for the drift ﬁeld used. This
procedure is illustrated in Fig. 6. The charges accumulated in-
side single GEM holes are then multiplied by the multiplication
factor of the GEM. The single electron multiplication distribu-
tion in a single GEM follows a Polya distribution [22], which
accommodates the ﬂuctuations of the ampliﬁcation process. In

gration volume and accordingly some hits might not be taken
into account in the analysis. An additional impact on the simu-
lated energy deposit may be introduced by the choice of physics
list, which steers the energy loss of the incident particle. By
varying the step length between 1 and 1000 µm and employing
a diﬀerent physics list (G4EmStandardPhysics option4), we
ﬁnd that the results are robust against the choice of the latter and
only impacted by very large step lengths O(100 µm). Hence, we
ﬁx the step length to 10 µm and smear the distance between the
GEANT4 hits according to a ﬂat distribution.

By not considering the ﬁeld distortions resulting from the
missing ﬁeld cage, an additional bias may be introduced to the
electron transport in the drift ﬁeld. Distortions of the drift ﬁeld
result in a non-constant drift velocity both with respect to mag-
nitude and direction, which would demand for a more sophis-
ticated treatment of the constant integration time tint. In order
to estimate the impact of the above described eﬀect, we have
conducted ﬁnite element calculations using the the COMSOL
Multiphysics R(cid:13) software [18] and found variations of the drift
ﬁeld below 1 % for the integration times of our interest, which
are therefore neglected.

4.2. Comparison to experimental data

In order to compare the measurements presented in the pre-
vious section to the outcome of the simulation, we vary dsource
in steps of 2 mm and the multiplication factor of the GEM in
steps of 50 for multiplication factors smaller than 1500 and in
steps of 250 above that.

In order to study the dependence of the two free parameters
of the model, tint and Qcrit, we compare the various simulation
outcomes with the data varying tint between 2 and 400 ns and
Qcrit in steps of 5 × 104 electrons between 1 × 105 and 1.25 × 107.
The best values of both parameters are then found with the help
of a χ2 minimisation procedure.

According to our observation, the data displayed in Fig. 5
are most sensitive to variations of tint. Therefore, we com-
pare the simulation outcomes to the measurements presented
in this plot to constrain the value of this parameter. Both tint
and Qcrit are varied within the above speciﬁed range for each
gas independently. For each combination of these values the
goodness of ﬁt χ2 is computed by comparing to the experimen-
tal data. The lowest χ2 determines the best value of tint with
the corresponding Qcrit as displayed in Fig. 7 for Ar-CO2 and
Ne-CO2 (90-10). For Ne-CO2 (90-10), the lowest values of
χ2 are achieved for integration times ranging between 20 and
90 ns, while for Ar-CO2 (90-10), the minimum is around 15 to
50 ns. The resulting critical charge limit Qcrit, however, varies
by about 10 % over the whole range of the probed values of tint
as shown in Fig. 7.

The best value of tint is then 50 ns for Ne-CO2 (90-10) and
30 ns for Ar-CO2 (90-10). If additionally all data of Fig. 4 are
considered for the best value of tint, the χ2 optimisation yields
slightly diﬀerent values of Qcrit for diﬀerent graphs. The result-
ing variation is below 10 % and accommodated by the bands
shown in Figs. 4 and 5 around the mean value of Qcrit for each
gas with a width is deﬁned by its RMS. The resulting values of

area of interest around a single GEM hole. The incident alpha particle is rep-
resented by the blue line, whilst the GEANT hits are displayed as yellow balls.
The resulting ionisation electrons are the gray dots. The height of the hexago-
nal shape deﬁnes the upper limit for charges that are taken into account for the
accumulation inside the GEM hole at its bottom. See text for details.

our case, however, a very large number of electrons is accu-
mulated inside a single GEM hole and therefore, according to
the central limit theorem, the shape of the ﬂuctuations is ex-
pected to become Gaussian and hence symmetric. Accordingly,
on average no impact on the discharge probability is expected.
Therefore, ﬂuctuations of the avalanche are not considered in
the model, which allows us to investigate the impact of solely
the primary charge density on the discharge probability.

As the dependence of the discharge probability on the accu-
mulated and multiplied charges inside a GEM hole is unknown,
we are left with the rather crude assumption of a ﬁxed thresh-
old of accumulated charges Qcrit. Accordingly, a discharge in
the simulation is deﬁned as an event in which the number of ac-
cumulated charges inside a single GEM hole exceeds the value
of the critical charge limit Qcrit. This corresponds to a situation
similar to the well-known Raether limit [10] for parallel plate
detectors. The exact critical limit valid for GEM-based detec-
tors will be estimated in the following way. The ﬁnal discharge
probability is deﬁned as the number of events in which Qcrit is
exceeded normalised to the number of simulated events for a
given drift gap and GEM multiplication factor and remarkably
requires no further normalisation. Note that only one such event
per drift gap, multiplication and event is possible as in this case
the potential diﬀerence across the GEM rapidly decreases and
thus prevents the formation of further discharges caused by the
very same incident particle.

The simulated energy deposit of the alpha-particles varies
with the penetration depth, reaching a distinctive maximum at
the very end of the particle’s track (Bragg peak). Therefore, a
signiﬁcant dependence of the GEANT4 step length on the latter
is expected. Consequently, in particular for very small integra-
tion times, the step length could be larger than the actual inte-

Qcrit for Ar-CO2 and Ne-CO2 (90-10) mixtures are summarised
in Table 3.

As only one dsource, i.e. one graph in Fig. 4, can be used to
constrain Qcrit for Ar-CO2 (70-30) and Ne-CO2-N2 (90-10-5),
it is not possible to apply the full χ2 minimization technique to
ﬁnd a best value of tint. Therefore, an integration time of 40 ns is
chosen which is a good compromise of the above found values
of tint. Even though the variation of Qcrit within the range of tint
is negligible, the resulting values should be considered with due
diligence and are therefore omitted in Fig. 7. The values of Qcrit
for Ar-CO2 (70-30) and Ne-CO2-N2 (90-10-5) are of the order
of 5 × 106 and 9 × 106, respectively, and therefore compatible
with the results in Table 3.

4.3. Conclusions from the model

The comparison of the model, taking into account only the
primary charge density at the GEM plane, to the measurements
in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 yields reasonable agreement and demon-
strates the validity of the assumption of a critical charge limit
underlying the discharge formation. Remarkably, the model re-
quires no further normalisation to ﬁt to the data. The resulting
values for this critical charge limit Qcrit are in line with the pre-
dictions based on the Raether limit and the values presented in
[11] and diﬀers between the gas mixtures used in the detector.

In our model we have introduced the integration time tint
to mimic the impact of charge accumulation inside the GEM
holes. For integration times larger than the transfer time of
electrons O(ns) [24], clearly an inﬂuence of a mechanism dif-
ferent than the simple accumulation of electrons is expected.
This holds, in particular, to the case in which charge accumu-
lation prior to a discharge occurs over a time of a few tens of
ns, which is of the same order as the transfer time of the ions
produced in the avalanche to the top GEM electrode [24]. The
accordingly accumulating space charge modiﬁes the ampliﬁca-
tion ﬁeld and thus leads to the development of a streamer, as
also concluded in [25]. Our results on the integration time tint
support this hypothesis.

The diﬀerence of the values of Qcrit and tint for the diﬀer-
ent gases might be related to the precise mechanism how the
discharge forms in the respective medium.

5. Summary

We have performed systematic studies of the discharge prob-
ability in a single GEM detector exposed to heavily ionising
alpha particles in Ar- and Ne-based gas mixtures. Our experi-
mental ﬁndings imply that large clusters of primary charge are
the main reason for the discharge formation in a GEM detector.
We show that the occurrence of sparks is more likely in argon
than in neon mixtures since in the latter the enhanced range of
alpha particles and higher ionisation potentials result in lower
primary charge densities.

The hypothesis was conﬁrmed by Monte-Carlo simulations
in which we explicitly calculate the number of primary elec-
trons liberated by alpha particles at a given distance between
the source and the GEM. Taking into account the primary ion-
isation distribution and basic transport properties of the gas
mixtures, we are able reproduce the experimentally measured
discharge probability by normalising the number of events in
which the charge contained inside a single GEM hole exceeds
a critical charge threshold Qcrit to the total number of emitted
alpha particles.

Simulation and experimental data sets allowed us to extract
the critical charge density which leads to a discharge in a GEM
hole. We obtain Qcrit of (4.7 ± 0.6) × 106 and (7.3 ± 0.9) × 106
electrons per GEM hole for Ar-CO2 (90-10) and Ne-CO2 (90-
10) mixtures respectively. The diﬀerence may point to an ad-
ditional inﬂuence of gas properties on the discharge formation
process.

We conclude that it is the number of particles that cross the
GEM volume which determines the discharge rate of the detec-
tor, and that the primary charge that reaches the readout cham-
bers after a (relatively) long drift has signiﬁcantly less impact
on the detector stability.

In multi-GEM systems the total gain can be shared between
several foils building a stack, and thus increasing its stability
against electrical discharges. However, the local charge densi-
ties approaching a single hole in any GEM of the stack should
be regarded as the driving criterion to trigger sparks. With the
expected primary charge distribution at hand, the approach pre-
