ABSTRACT 
We  analyze  spectropolarimetric  observations  of  the  chromospheric  Ca  II  8542  line  taken  by  the  Interferometric 
Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope and photospheric Fe I 6302 lines obtained with the Solar 
Optical  Telescope  (SOT)  of  Spectro-polarimeter  (SP)  on  board  the  Hinode  satellite.  The  data  were  obtained  on  2012 
January 29 targeting NOAA active region (AR) 11408 and AR 11410. By using the center-of-gravity (COG) method we 
compute the line-of-sight (LOS) field strength for observed lines of Fe I 6301.5/6302.5 with SP spacecraft at every places 
in the active region. Also, we construct a COG map for the chromospheric IBIS data of Ca II 8542 line in comparison 
with  COG  maps derived from the SP of field strength. We found the photospheric  field strength ranges  up to 2 kG in 
plages and up to 2 kG or higher values inside the umbral region. In the case of chromospheric field strength, the LOS 
field inside the umbral region increases up to 800 G, and the field strength decreases toward the edges of sunspot.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The IBIS is a two-dimensional spectro-polarimeter that has been installed for the polarimetry of the Sun (Cavallini 2006; 
Reardon  &  Cavallini  2008)  established  at  the  Dunn  Solar  Telescope.  It  produces  polarimetric  data  of  the  four  Stokes 
IQUV profiles using for measurements of the magnetic field on the Sun. The spectropolarimetric data allows us a best 
possibility to derive all components of the field strength with high spatial resolution, as recently determined by (Ichimoto 
& Shaltout 2012; Shaltout & Ichimoto 2015). 

The  Solar  Optical  Telescope  (SOT)  on  board  the  Hinode  Kosugi  et  al.  (2007)  satellite  has  provided  two  kinds  of 
spectropolarimetric data of spectral line profiles of full Stokes taken by Spectro-polarimeter and Stokes I and V images 
obtained by the Narrowband Filter Imager (NFI). Since the SOT/SP data have a spatial resolution of 0.3 arcsec per pixel. 
The  high  spatial  resolution  of  SP  observations  of  sunspots  show  that  there  are  a  lot  of  different  morphological 
phenomena of dark central regions, called umbra and a surrounding less dark filamentary region called penumbra. 

The COG is a simple approach to infer the LOS field strength from the observed Stokes I and V profiles without taking 
into account the filling factor of magnetic elements. It has been adopted in various investigations (Rees & Semel 1979; 
Cauzzi et al. 1993; Uitenbroek 2003; Balasubramaniam et al. 2004; Nagaraju et al. 2008; Kleint et al. 2009). The COG 
gives information on the polarity of field, weak and strong field regions, and it can be used for the comparison between 
photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields. 

In the current paper we employ the COG method described by Rees & Semel (1979) to obtain the magnetic field strength 
from the observational of chromospheric and photospheric data within an accuracy of about 10%. Given the advantage of 
the high-resolution observations, the COG can be applied without using model of radiative transfer. The observations are 
explained in section 2. The center-of-gravity and results are described in section 3. Finally, a conclusion is presented in 
section 4.

2.  OBSERVATIONS 
The  sunspot  of  NOAA  11408  was  observed  on  2012  January  29  with  the  IBIS,  which  has  been  provided  by  Schad 
(2015).  It  was  located  at  a  heliocentric  angle  of 
  at  the  time  of  observation.  The  IBIS  recorded  full 
  (effective  Landé  factor  g  =  1.10)  with  a  spatial  sampling  of  0˝.0976.  The 
Stokes  profiles  of  Ca  II  line  at  8542.1 
observation began at 16:33 UT and finished at 17:04 UT. The spectral sampling of Ca II 8542 was covered a range from 
8540.35  to  8542.85 
  over  the  whole  line  profile.  In  full  Stokes  mode,  six  modulated 
polarization states were measured (I+Q, I+V, I-Q, I-V, I-U, I+U) at each spectral sample. The wavelength points across 
the spectral line was about 20 with a cadence of 50 sec. The IBIS image has a field of view (FOV) of 45˝ x 95˝.

The SP data was observed on 2012 January 29 for determining the LOS field strength in active region. The target active 
region analyzed here is AR 11410 located at (X= -562ʺ, Y= 378ʺ) at the observed time. The SP listed full Stokes profiles 
 (g = 2.5). The Stokes IQUV spectral profiles 
of Fe I lines at 6301.5 
were obtained with an integration time of 3.9 s at each step.

The observations started at 22:01 UT and ended at 23:04 UT as a fast raster scan  mode. The SP image took about  60 
minutes with 1000 slit steps to map the FOV. The raster scan covered a FOV of 295ʺ x 162ʺ. We used the IDL standard 
routine, SP_PREP (Lites & Ichimoto 2013), available under Solar Software (SSW), to calibrate the SP data. Since the 
step size was set to 0ʺ.295 and the number of pixels along the slit was 512. The pixel size along the slit direction was 
0ʺ.317.

3.  CENTER-OF-GRAVITY (COG) METHOD AND RESULTS  
From the IBIS and SP data, we use the observed Stokes I and V profiles for given wavelengths with the COG method, as 
has been described in Nagaraju et al. (2008). Since the LOS magnetic field (in Gauss) was obtained by the formula:

The coefficient 
 value of Ca II 8542 line is 13.3 kG/Å but its value is 10.8 kG/Å for the Fe I 6302.5 line and 16.1 kG/Å 
for the Fe I 6301.5 line. The integration (summation) is over the spectral range of a given spectral line. Figure 2 shows 
the COG wavelengths selected at four places in active region for the illustration, as computed from Equation 2 with the 
observed IBIS data.

IBIS  images  selected  from  south-north  directions  passing  through  the  center  of  the 
sunspot.  

We  notice  that  the  blending  in  the  spectral  I  profiles  is  less  serious,  therefore,  we  did  not  use  cleaning  processes  as  a 
linear  combination  of  Gaussian  functions,  because  the  shapes  of  Stokes  I  and  V  profiles  look  familiar  in  the  umbral 
regions of sunspot, as shown in figure 2 at the top row of left panel.  The plots of photospheric and chromospheric LOS 
field strengths along two radial cuts are exhibited in figure 3. Using the SP data, the right side of figure 3 shows the plot 
of V/I profile versus the photospheric LOS magnetic field along a radial slice through the central umbra of the sunspot 
image. The photospheric field strength along this radial cut increases up to about 2000 G, which is consistent with the 
result suggested by Chae et al. (2007).  With the IBIS data, the V/I profile against the chromospheric LOS field strength 
is presented on the left side of figure 3. We take the same position on the sunspot image of IBIS, as done with SP data. 
The  chromospheric  field  strength  increases  up  to  about  800  G,  our  result  is  in  agreement  with  that  of  Nagaraju  et  al. 
(2008).

magnetic  field  strengths  of  Fe  I  6302  lines  in  regions  outside  sunspot.  The  solid  line 
refers to the line best fit. 

The photospheric field strength is larger in the umbral region and decreases toward the edges of the sunspot. In the case 
of  chromospheric  field  strength,  the  same  features  were  noticed,  but  the  chromospheric  field  values  are  considerably 
smaller as compared to the photospheric field. 
In  the  right  panel  of  figure  4,  we  show  the  V/I  profile  along  the  chromospheric  field  strength  in  the  umbral  region  of 
sunspot.  The  solid  line  represents  the  line  fit  through  these  points.  This  figure  indicates  a  coherent  result  of  magnetic 
fields  in  the  umbra,  showing  that  a  linear  relationship  between  V/I  and 
  results.  Also,  the  correlation  coefficient 
 is found to be 0.79 at umbral regions. Figure 4 (left panel) displays LOS magnetic field strengths 
between V/I and 
of Fe I 6301.5/6302.5 lines in regions outside sunspot, which obtained with the SP observation. The correlation between 
  of  Fe  I  6301  is  0.98  at  the  regions  outside  sunspots.  The  main  features  at  regions  outside  sunspots  are 
V/I  and 
plages and networks. Our result exhibits that these features have LOS fields ranged from –2 kG to 2 kG, and the same 
result was verified by Chae et al. (2007).

4.  CONCLUSION 
In  this  paper,  we  analyzed  the  chromospheric  LOS  component  of  magnetic  field  of  Ca  II  8542  taken  by  the  IBIS 
instrument and photospheric Fe I 6301.5/6302.5 observed on board the Hinode satellite, respectively. 
We adopted the COG approach proposed by Rees & Semel (1979) to derive the magnetic field strengths, showing that 
the chromospheric LOS field strength is from -1.5 kG to 0.5 kG, while the photospheric LOS field strength increases up 
to 2 kG. 
We compare the photospheric and chromospheric LOS magnetic field strengths in two active regions. The chromospheric 
magnetic  field  strength  is  weaker  as  compared  to  the  photospheric  field,  as  has  been  confirmed  by  (Solanki  2003; 
Nagaraju  et  al.  2008).  It  is  interesting  that  this  analysis  was  obtained  without  taking  into  account  the  filling  factor  of 
magnetic elements. 
The  photospheric  LOS  field  strengths  outside  sunspot  regions  are  scaled  over ranges  of  –2  kG  to  2  kG,  therefore,  our 
finding was supported by Chae et al. (2007).
