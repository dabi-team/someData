ABSTRACT

Context. Magnetic helicity is a physical quantity of great importance in the study of astrophysical and natural plasmas. Although a
density for helicity cannot be deﬁned, a good proxy for it is ﬁeld line helicity. The appropriate quantity for use in solar conditions is
relative ﬁeld line helicity (RFLH).
Aims. This work aims to study in detail the behaviour of RFLH, for the ﬁrst time, in a solar active region (AR).
Methods. The target active region is the large, eruptive AR 11158. In order to compute RFLH and all other quantities of interest we
use a non-linear force-free reconstruction of the AR coronal magnetic ﬁeld of excelent quality.
Results. We ﬁnd that the photospheric morphology of RFLH is quite diﬀerent than that of the magnetic ﬁeld or of the electrical
current, and this is not sensitive to the chosen gauge in the computation of RFLH. The value of helicity experiences a large decrease,
∼ 25% of its pre-ﬂare value, during an X-class ﬂare of the AR, a change that is also depicted in the photospheric morphology of
RFLH. Moreover, the area of this change coincides with the area that encompasses the ﬂux rope, the magnetic structure that later
erupted.
Conclusions. The use of RFLH can provide important information about the value and location of the magnetic helicity expelled
from the solar atmosphere during eruptive events.

1. Introduction

Magnetic helicity is a quantity that represents an important re-
striction in the evolution of astrophysical plasmas in the mag-
netohydrodynamics (MHD) description, since it is conserved
in ideal MHD (Woltjer 1958), and approximately conserved in
non-ideal conditions (Taylor 1974; Pariat et al. 2015). Mag-
netic helicity indicates the complexity of a magnetic ﬁeld, as
it measures the twist, writhe, and interlinking of the magnetic
ﬁeld lines. Mathematically, it is deﬁned as the volume integral
H = (cid:82)
V A · B dV, where B is the magnetic ﬁeld in the volume V,
and A the corresponding vector potential such that B = ∇ × A.
Helicity thus depends on the chosen gauge for A unless the vol-
ume of interest is bounded by a magnetic ﬂux surface. This con-
dition is not met in the Sun where magnetic ﬂux is exchanged
between the photosphere and the solar interior. The appropriate
quantity in this case is relative magnetic helicity (Berger & Field
1984), which is deﬁned with the help of a reference magnetic
ﬁeld.

An important application of the conservation property of
helicity in the Sun is to the initiation of coronal mass ejec-
tions (CMEs). These eruptions usually involve the expulsion of
highly-twisted, i.e., helical, magnetic structures, the ﬂux ropes
(FRs, Green et al. 2018; Patsourakos et al. 2020). According to
a popular scenario (Rust 1994; Low 1994), CMEs are the means
for the corona to remove the constantly accumulating helicity
from the solar interior. In cases like this it would be desirable
to be able to pinpoint the locations on the Sun, or in the solar
corona, where helicity is more important.

The classical and relative helicities however are non-local
quantities, due to their dependence on the vector potential, which
means that the respective densities lack a proper deﬁnition. The

most meaningful way to deﬁne a helicity density is with ﬁeld line
helicity (FLH, Antiochos 1987; Berger 1988). Field line helicity
is given by the line integral h = (cid:82)
C A · dl along a ﬁeld line C.
FLH is a function of the ﬁeld lines, which expresses the ﬂux of
the magnetic ﬁeld through the surface bounded by the ﬁeld line,
when this is closed, otherwise, it has no direct physical meaning.
The appropriate generalization of FLH for use at the solar
environment, the relative ﬁeld line helicity (RFLH), was only
recently developed (Yeates & Page 2018; Moraitis et al. 2019).
These works deﬁned two distinct forms for relative FLH which
diﬀer in the used gauge. Both forms however, accurately repro-
duce relative helicity when all ﬁeld lines that pierce the boundary
of the volume are considered.

Field line helicity, in its classical or relative form, has been
employed in various solar applications. In one application, FLH
was used to trace the connectivity changes caused by reconnec-
tion in a magnetic ﬁeld setup which simulated coronal loops
(Russell et al. 2015). In another example, Yeates & Hornig
(2016) have applied FLH to the global magnetic ﬁeld of the Sun
in order to study the distribution of helicity in the solar corona.
An interesting application of FLH was in the determination of
the FRs location in an approximation of the solar corona, through
a threshold in FLH (Lowder & Yeates 2017). The properties of
FLH have also been examined theoretically in Aly (2018). Most
of the applications of FLH and RFLH so far are therefore ei-
ther in idealized situations, or to simulations of the actual solar
environment.

A ﬁrst, more realistic application of RFLH to observed so-
lar ARs was made in Moraitis et al. (2019). Using a non-linear
force-free (NLFF) reconstruction of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld
of a solar active region at a speciﬁc instant, the authors examined
the relation of RFLH with the helicity ﬂux density (e.g., Pariat

et al. 2005). They showed that the two quantities exhibit overall
similar photospheric spatial distributions, while some minor dif-
ferences were also observed. This work highlighted the potential
of using RFLH in actual solar conditions.

In this work, we go one step further, as our purpose is to
study the behaviour of relative ﬁeld line helicity in a large ob-
served active region (AR) over an extended time interval. In
Sect. 2 we deﬁne all quantities of interest, and we describe the
observational data, as well as the implementation details, that we
use. In Sect. 3 we present the results of the application of RFLH
in the chosen AR, focusing on a speciﬁc large ﬂare. Finally, in
Sect. 4 we summarize and discuss the results of the paper.

2. Methodology

2.1. Active region selection

The active region chosen for the ﬁrst detailed study of the be-
haviour of RFLH in solar conditions is AR 11158. The reasons
for this choice are many. First, there is an extensive literature
about this AR, with many diﬀerent of its characteristics exam-
ined (e.g., Sun et al. 2012; Tziotziou et al. 2013). Second, during
the passage of the AR from the solar disk it exhibited a range of
behaviours, with most notable, the numerous ﬂares (up to the X-
class) and the CMEs that accompanied many of them. Third, a
high-quality reconstruction of the AR’s coronal magnetic ﬁeld,
that is necessary in our computations, was available to us (Thal-
mann et al. 2019b).

We employed two data products from the Solar Dynamic Ob-
servatory (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012) in this work. These were the
sharp_cea_720s data series from the Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012) instrument and the
lev1_uv_24s one at 1600 Å from the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) instrument (Lemen et al. 2012). The time in-
terval that we examined was between 12 February 2011, 00:00
UT and 16 February 2011, 00:00 UT. In this interval AR 11158
exhibited two M-class ﬂares, an M6.6 on 13 February with peak
time at 17:38 UT and an M2.2 on 14 February at 17:26 UT, and
the X2.2 ﬂare on 15 February at 01:56 UT, all of which were
eruptive.

2.2. Quantities of interest

2.2.1. Relative magnetic helicity

2.2.2. Energies

Although we are not interested in the evolution of the various en-
ergies in this work, there are energy-related parameters that help
us identify the quality of a given magnetic ﬁeld. We introduce
these parameters in the following.

The energy of a magnetic ﬁeld B is given by the well-known

relation
E = 1
2µ0

(cid:90)

V

B2dV,

(3)

where µ0 is the magnetic permeability of the vacuum. A use-
ful decomposition of this energy is based on the unique splitting
of the magnetic ﬁeld into potential and current-carrying compo-
nents, B = Bp + Bj. Following Valori et al. (2013), each com-
ponent can be further divided into solenoidal and non-solenoidal
parts, as Bp = Bp,s + Bp,ns and Bj = Bj,s + Bj,ns. By deﬁning
the energy of each component from Eq. (3) we end up with the
following decomposition

E = Ep,s + Ep,ns + Ej,s + Ej,ns + Emix,

(4)

where Emix denotes the energy corresponding to all the cross
terms. For a perfectly solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld, Eq. (4) reduces
to the more familiar form E = Ep,s + Ej,s, where Ej,s can be iden-
tiﬁed as the free energy.

The non-solenoidal parts of the magnetic ﬁelds and the re-
spective terms in Eq. (4) are non-physical and stem solely from
numerical reasons. Collecting these terms together, leads to the
deﬁnition of the energy

Ediv = Ep,ns + Ej,ns + |Emix|,

(5)

which is a measure of how much a numerical model of a mag-
netic ﬁeld deviates from solenoidality; lower values of Ediv,
and consequently of the energy ratio Ediv/E, indicate a less
solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld. Regarding helicity computations, Val-
ori et al. (2016) have set a threshold of Ediv/E (cid:46) 0.08 for helicity
values to be reliable, which was later reﬁned to Ediv/E (cid:46) 0.05
by Thalmann et al. (2019a), where the various energies for the
same AR 11158 were discussed.

Another energy ratio that is related to the quality of a mag-
netic ﬁeld with respect to its solenoidality is |Emix|/Ej,s, which
shows the importance of the cross term in Eq. (4) relative to the
free energy. Values of |Emix|/Ej,s (cid:46) 0.35 are related with mag-
netic ﬁelds of higher quality (Thalmann et al. 2020).

The appropriate magnetic helicity for the Sun is relative mag-
netic helicity (Berger & Field 1984). For a three-dimensional
(3D) magnetic ﬁeld B in a ﬁnite volume V, this is given by the
Finn & Antonsen (1985) formula

2.2.3. Relative ﬁeld line helicity

a. Unconstrained gauge

Hr =

(cid:90)

V

(A + Ap) · (B − Bp) dV.

(1)

The magnetic ﬁeld Bp serves as a reference ﬁeld, and usually it
is chosen to be potential, while A, Ap are the respective vector
potentials of the two magnetic ﬁelds. Relative magnetic helicity
is independent of the chosen gauges of the two vector potentials,
as long as the normal components of the magnetic ﬁelds are the
same on the boundary of the volume, ∂V. This condition can be
written as

ˆn · B|∂V = ˆn · Bp

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)∂V ,

(2)

with ˆn denoting the outward-pointing unit normal on ∂V.

The most general expression for the ﬁeld line helicity that cor-
responds to relative magnetic helicity was derived in Moraitis
et al. (2019), and it is reviewed here for completeness. Relative
ﬁeld line helicity (RFLH), hr, can be considered as the density
of relative magnetic helicity per unit magnetic ﬂux. This follows
from the relation

Hr =

(cid:73)

∂V

hr dΦ,

(6)

where dΦ = |ˆn · B| dS is the elementary magnetic ﬂux on the
boundary (dS : elementary area). Equation (6) results directly
from Eq. (1) after expanding the integrand of the latter and split-
ting the volume element along the ﬁeld lines of B as dV = dS·dl,
or, of Bp as dV = dS · dlp (dl, dlp: elementary lengths along

Moraitis et al.: Relative ﬁeld line helicity of AR 11158

respective ﬁeld lines). The only assumption made in deriving
Eq. (6) is the reasonable smoothness of the magnetic ﬁeld, and
especially the lack of null points where ﬁeld lines are discontin-
uous. Additionally, this relation is useful when most of the ﬁeld
lines of B are connected to the boundary at both ends, i.e., when
the number of closed ﬁeld lines inside the volume is limited.

As its name indicates, RFLH is a function of the ﬁeld lines
that assigns a single value to each ﬁeld line (pair of footpoints),
and so, it can be viewed as a 2D map that depends on the loca-
tion on the boundary. Denoting the part of the boundary where
magnetic ﬂux enters into (leaves) the volume as ∂V + (∂V −), and
the footpoints of a generic ﬁeld line of B as α+ ∈ ∂V +, α− ∈ ∂V −
(and as αp+ ∈ ∂V +, αp− ∈ ∂V − for Bp, respectively), then RFLH
is given by any of the following expressions

The ﬁrst expression involves the integration along ﬁeld lines of
B and Bp that have common their positive-polarity footpoints,
α+ = αp+, as shown by the red and green ﬁeld lines in Fig. 1.
When using h+
r in Eq. (6), only the positive-polarity part of the
boundary, ∂V +, should be considered, so that each ﬁeld line is
counted once.

Similarly, if the ﬁeld lines of the two ﬁelds have in common
the negative-polarity footpoints, α− = αp−, then the RFLH
expression given by Eq. (8) should be used along the ∂V −
boundary (red and blue ﬁeld lines in Fig. 1). When the whole
boundary is considered, the respective RFLH, Eq. (9), involves
all ﬁeld lines shown in Fig. 1. In all cases the RFLH is expressed
as a line integral along the ﬁeld lines of B relative to the same
quantity along those of Bp, thus justifying its name.

line helicity.

b. Berger & Field gauge

The expressions for RFLH given above make no assumption on
the gauge of the vector potentials. RFLH however is a gauge-
dependent quantity, as it can easily be seen from any of Eqs. (7)-
(9), and this can be exploited in order to derive simpler expres-
sions for the RFLH. A commonly-used gauge for the two vector
potentials is given by the relation
= ˆn × A|∂V .

ˆn × Ap

(10)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)∂V

This gauge condition can be fulﬁlled with the tangential compo-
nents of Ap determined from those of A, while the latter can be
in any gauge. The condition given by Eq. (10) leads to the elim-
ination of the cross terms in the integrand of Eq. (1), which then
reads

Hr =

(cid:90)

V

(cid:90)

A · B dV −

Ap · Bp dV.

V

(11)

This gauge was used in the original deﬁnition of relative mag-
netic helicity by Berger & Field (1984). Starting from Eq. (11),
Yeates & Page (2018) deﬁned the following relative ﬁeld line
helicity

˜h+
r

=

(cid:90) α−

(cid:90) αp−

written here for the positive-polarity boundary, with analogous
to Eqs. (8) and (9) relations holding for the other expressions,
˜h−
r , ˜h0
r . These relative RFLHs are constructed similarly to the
RFLHs in the uncontsrained gauge, they employ however a spe-
ciﬁc gauge condition.

2.3. Implementation

2.3.1. Magnetic ﬁeld modelling

All physical quantities that interest this work require as input
the 3D magnetic ﬁeld in the coronal volume. The 3D ﬁeld at
each instant is reconstructed from the corresponding observed
HMI magnetogram with a NLFF method. This uses a weighted
optimization approach (Wiegelmann & Inhester 2010), after pre-
processing the horizontal components of the ﬁeld on the photo-
sphere so that it becomes more compatible with the force-free
assumption, and additionally, smoothing of the original vector
magnetogram. The full details of the method can be found in
Thalmann et al. (2019b) where this reconstruction was ﬁrst used.
We only mention here that the original HMI data were
slightly cropped so that to leave quiet-Sun regions outside, and
then rebinned by a factor of four, to the resolution of 2(cid:48)(cid:48) per
pixel. The resulting NLFF ﬁeld occupies the volume 215 Mm ×
130 Mm × 185 Mm, and it is discretized by 148 × 92 × 128 grid
points. In total, there are 115 snapshots with the typical cadence
of 1 hr, except around the M6.6 and the X2.2 ﬂares, when HMI’s
highest cadence of 12 minutes was used.

The morphology of the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld for a
snapshot ∼ 1 hr before the X-class ﬂare is shown in Fig. 2. A
low-lying ﬂux rope surrounded by an arcade ﬁeld can be iden-
tiﬁed there, as is already known by other works (e.g., Sun et al.
2012; Nindos et al. 2012). Moreover, Fig. 2 shows that the RFLH
values of the ﬂux rope are higher than in the arcade ﬁeld.

One of the reasons for choosing the speciﬁc AR for this study
is the excellent quality of the reconstruction of the AR’s 3D mag-
netic ﬁeld. The quality of the ﬁeld is intended as the accuracy in
fulﬁlling the assumptions of the NLFFF method, as quantiﬁed
by the low values of divergence-, and force-freeness reported
in Thalmann et al. (2019b). The respective parameters used by
the authors are the average absolute fractional ﬂux increase and
the average current-weighted angle between the current and the
magnetic ﬁeld (Wheatland et al. 2000).

Besides these parameters the high level of divergence-
freeness of the magnetic ﬁeld is further shown with the follow-
ing three parameters. The ﬁrst is the recently-proposed modi-
ﬁcation of the fractional ﬂux increase which, unlike the origi-
nal parameter, is independent of the mesh size (Gilchrist et al.

3. Results

3.1. RFLH morphology

Following the methodology in Sect. 2 we calculate all quantities
of interest for all available snapshots of the NLFF magnetic ﬁeld
model. In Fig. 3 we show four snapshots from the evolution of
the morphology of RFLH on the photospheric plane, z = 0, in the
unconstrained gauge, h0
r , and also, of the vertical magnetic ﬁeld,
Bz, and of the vertical electrical current, jz = (∇ × B)z /µ0, also
on the photospheric level. Each snapshot provides an example of
the ﬁeld conﬁguration in each of the four intervals in which the
major ﬂares divide our study interval into: one before the M6.6
ﬂare, one between the two M-class ﬂares, one between the M2.2
and the X2.2 ﬂares, and one after the X2.2 ﬂare.

The morphology of the vertical magnetic ﬁeld evolved from
two initial nearby bipoles that converged into a highly sheared
bipolar ﬂux distribution internal to the outer polarities (e.g.,
Chintzoglou & Zhang 2013). The vertical current distribution
primarily develops around the polarity inversion lines (PILs),
and it follows to a large degree the evolution of the magnetic
ﬁeld, as the comparison with the respective contours shows in
Fig. 3. The RFLH morphology is however diﬀerent than the
other distributions. It is more extended, and it has a much less
coincidence with the magnetic ﬁeld contours. The sign of the
RFLH is mostly positive, in agreement with the AR helicity sign.
The highest (positive) RFLH values are located around the core
polarities of the AR. This central part of RFLH becomes more
intense until around the time of the X-class ﬂare, and ﬁnally re-
laxes to lower values. The behaviour of RFLH around the ﬂare
is examined in more detail in Sect. 3.3. The lowest RFLH values
are found to the east periphery of the AR (left in the respective
panels of Fig. 3), with only a small coincidence with the nearby
magnetic ﬁeld polarity.

The corresponding evolution of the relative helicity budgets,
as calculated by the volume method of Eq. (1), and of the RFLH
method of Eq. (6) on the full magnetogram, is shown in Fig. 4
with the black and grey curves, respectively. We note that from
13 February onwards, the helicities obtained with the two meth-
ods agree to a large extent. We quantify this agreement in the bot-
tom panel of Fig. 4 where we notice that the relative diﬀerence
between the two curves is within (cid:46) 5%, with an average absolute
value of 2.2%. In calculating these numbers we omit the day of
February 12 when the values of helicity are very low and conse-
quently the relative diﬀerence much higher than in the following
days. The closeness of the two helicity curves indicates that the
RFLH method works as expected, since it exhibits similar lev-
els of agreement as in Moraitis et al. (2019). It also shows that
most of the ﬁeld lines contributing to helicity are indeed rooted
in the phothosphere rather than on the lateral boundaries. Both
methods indicate a large drop in helicity during the X-class ﬂare,
which we further discuss in the following sections.

We note here that the morphology of RFLH is not sensitive to
the gauge used in its computation, at least in areas of high RFLH
values. This can be seen in Fig. 5 where we compare the mor-
phology obtained with the two gauges of Sect. 2 for the snapshot
at 07:59 UT of 15 February 2011. We see that the two distri-
butions have similar morphologies, although they also exhibit
some minor diﬀerences in small patches. The good agreement of
the two maps is depicted in the high value of the pixel-to-pixel
linear correlation coeﬃcient between them, which is 0.85. The
main diﬀerence between the two distributions is in the magni-
tude of RFLH which is by a factor of (cid:46) 2 smaller in the Berger &
Field gauge. The morphology in this gauge is also more smooth
because of the Coulomb gauge used in the computation of the

UT of 15 February 2011, for the NLFF extrapolation used in this work.
Field lines are coloured according to the value of RFLH, which is pos-
itive for all selected ﬁeld lines, and they are overplotted on the photo-
spheric distribution of the vertical magnetic ﬁeld, with the red contours

2020). This is quite low, with a mean value over all the 115
snapshots of (cid:104)| fd|(cid:105) = (1.50 ± 0.06) × 10−9 m−1. Additionally,
the energy ratio proposed by Valori et al. (2016) is well be-
low the threshold of 0.08, or even of 0.05, with a value of
Ediv/E = (6.1 ± 0.3) × 10−3. The other energy ratio (Thalmann
et al. 2020) is also much lower than the respective limit of 0.35,
with a value of |Emix|/Ej,s = 0.051 ± 0.006. Such high quality of
the reconstructed magnetic ﬁeld thus quarantees the reliability of
the subsequent helicity computations.

2.3.2. Numerical computations

The computation of all the physical quantities can be performed
in a three-step process, once the magnetic ﬁeld is provided by
the NLFF method. The ﬁrst step is the computation of the po-
tential ﬁeld that satisﬁes the condition of Eq. (2). This is derived
by numerically solving Laplace’s equation. The second step in-
volves the computation of the vector potentials from the respec-
tive magnetic ﬁelds. This is done by adopting the DeVore (2000)
gauge as this was modiﬁed by Valori et al. (2012). The full de-
tails involved in these two steps are described in Moraitis et al.
(2014).

The third step is required only for the RFLH computations,
and it involves two diﬀerent ﬁeld line integrations, one for B,
and one for Bp. These integrations are performed with the fast
and robust method that is described in Moraitis et al. (2019). A
diﬀerence with that work is that here we consider only the ﬁeld
lines with (at least one) footpoint on the photospheric part of
the boundary. We thus neglect the lateral and top parts of the
boundary, as our experience has shown that a very small piece
of information is lost. Once the ﬁeld lines are obtained, we com-
pute the RFLH expression in the unconstrained gauge, h0
r , from
Eq. (9).

For the computation of the RFLH in the Berger & Field
gauge, ˜h0
r , the three-step process is slightly diﬀerent than the one
just described. The reason is that the computation is performed
with the code provided by Yeates & Page (2018), which uses a
diﬀerent calculation for the potential magnetic ﬁeld, and treats
all vector quantities in a staggered grid instead of being colo-
cated.

vector potentials. Similar diﬀerences exhibit the other snapshots
as well.

3.2. Flare-related changes during the X2.2 ﬂare

We now focus on the X2.2 ﬂare of AR 11158 of 15 February
2011. The ﬂare’s onset time was 01:44 UT and its peak time
was 01:56 UT. Using observations from SDO’s AIA instrument
at 1600 Å we are able to identify two regions related to the oc-
curence of the ﬂare. The ﬁrst is the location of the ﬂare ribbons

which are shown in the top panel of Fig. 6, at the time of their
maximum extent (01:48 UT) before the saturation of the image
from the ﬂare emission. According to the standard model for the
3D ﬂares (Janvier et al. 2013), the ﬂare ribbons correspond to
the footprints of the quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) that separates
the ﬂux rope from the surrounding, conﬁning ﬁeld. This image
resulted after correcting the original AIA image with standard
methods (solar software’s aia_prep routine), and transforming
it to the same projection and ﬁeld of view (FOV) as the HMI
images of Fig. 3, following the recipes of Sun (2013). The lat-
ter procedure slightly deforms the shape of the image, but this is

minimal due to the proximity of the AR to the solar disk centre.
We approximate the region corresponding to the central, highest-
intensity contour with the red polygon shown in the bottom panel
of Fig. 6. The second region of interest includes the central po-
larities of the AR where the ﬂare originated during its peak (as
identiﬁed by eye inspection of AIA’s images), although nearly
the whole AR participated in this ﬂare. This region is shown as
a green box in the bottom panel of Fig. 6, and it encompasses
the area covered by the ribbons when they reach their maximum
extent.

In the panels (a), (b), (d), and (e) of Fig. 7 we show the evolu-
tion of the RFLH distribution in the corresponding areas around
the X-class ﬂare. We note that the overall morphology has small
variations in a two-hours interval around the ﬂare. The most im-
portant diﬀerence is the large decrease in the RFLH magnitude
between the snapshots at 01:47 UT and 01:59 UT, i.e., during the
maximum of the ﬂare. This is more evident in panels (c) and (f)
where the diﬀerence of the images at 01:47 UT and at 01:59 UT
with the image at 01:11 UT is shown, respectively. While the
ﬁrst diﬀerence image (panel c) shows small variations of both
signs in the whole FOV, the second image (panel f) depicts a
clear decrease in RFLH which is contained in the green box.

The use of RFLH thus enables us to identify the locations
where helicity is lost from the AR during the ﬂare and the re-
spective eruption, and to also calculate its value. It is also inter-
esting that the area of the RFLH decrease includes the location
of the ﬂux rope, and so we can deduce that a part of the ﬂux
rope was expelled during the ﬂare. In other words, we are able
to verify that the CME source coincides with the wider ﬂux rope
region. This conclusion agrees with many previous studies (e.g.,
Zhang et al. 2012; Patsourakos et al. 2013; Nindos et al. 2015;
Chintzoglou et al. 2015; Nindos et al. 2020).

intervals. We use this type of error as an indication for the actual
errors, since the computationally-deduced ones, by the method
of Moraitis et al. (2014), are very low.

In addition, Fig. 8 depicts the helicity budgets calculated by
the RFLH method for the two boxes of Fig. 6, as the green and
red lines. In calculating these, we employ Eq. (6) but consider
only those ﬁeld lines that have footpoints inside the respective
areas.

Figure 8 reiterates the good agreement of (cid:46) 5% between the
helicities obtained by the volume and the RFLH methods (black
and grey curves respectively). Both curves exhibit a 25% drop in
helicity during the ﬂare, which corresponds to 1.48 1042 Mx2 for
the volume method, and to the slightly larger 1.56 1042 Mx2 for
the RFLH one. The drop in the volume helicity is larger than the
computed errors and so it is not an artifact but a real drop, a con-
slusion that holds for the other helicity curves as well. Similar
sharp changes in other parameters related to the magnetic ﬁeld
have been reported previously for the same AR (Liu et al. 2012;
Sun et al. 2017).

Another conclusion that can be drawn from Fig. 8 is that the
helicities obtained by the RFLH method for the full FOV and
for the green box (grey and green curves respectively) agree to
a large extent. This can be explained with the majority of the
AR’s helicity being contained in the green box, a conclusion also
supported by the RFLH morphology in Fig. 7. The agreement is
more pronounced before the ﬂare, when the two curves agree to

3.3. Relation with the eruption of February 15

The X2.2 ﬂare of AR 11158 on February 15 was an eruptive one,
that is, it was accompanied by a CME. This was observed with
STEREO’s COR1 coronagraph at 2:05 UT of February 15, and
it had a peak velocity of ∼ 1300 km s−1 (Mariˇci´c et al. 2014).
The ejected structure took a part of the AR’s helicity which, ac-
cording to the previous section, should be positive (right-handed)
and no more than the maximum estimated helicity decrease of
∼ 1.5 1042 Mx2. The CME was recorded three days later, start-
ing at February 18 around 20:00 UT, as an Interplanetary Coro-
nal Mass Ejection (ICME), using in situ data at the Lagrange
point L1 from the Wind spacecraft (Mariˇci´c et al. 2014; Lepping
et al. 2015). This ICME was also listed in several other catalogs
(Richardson & Cane 2010; Chi et al. 2016; Hess & Zhang 2017)
at a similar time interval.

From the ﬁtting of the ICME with a linear force-free mag-
netic cloud (MC) model, Lepping et al. (2015, Table 2 therein)
ﬁnd a value for the axial magnetic ﬁeld strength of B0 = 11.4 nT,
and for the radius of the MC, r0 = 0.06 AU. Further assum-
ing the arbitrary, but consistent however with energetic elec-
tron recordings in ICMEs (Kahler et al. 2011), length for the
MC of L ∼ 2 AU, one can estimate the helicity of the ICME to
Hr ∼ 2 1041 Mx2, following the equations in Dasso et al. (2006).
This value is signiﬁcantly smaller than the entire AR’s helicity,
and also of the helicity contained in the two boxes. The compar-
ison with the corresponding helicity drops shows that the MC’s
helicity is a factor of ∼ 7 smaller than the helicity lost from the
whole AR, or from the green box area. It is closer however to
the helicity lost in the ﬂare ribbons’ area (red box), but still, a
factor of ∼ 3 smaller. A problem with the helicity reported in
Lepping et al. (2015) is that this is left-handed, i.e., it has oppo-
site sign compared to the AR. Moreover, as discussed by Lep-
ping et al. (2015), the quality of the MC ﬁtting for this ICME is
poor, exhibiting convergence issues. Therefore, this ICME does
not represent the most optimal case for comparisons with solar
observations. Despite all the uncertainties in the estimation of
the MC’s helicity, the absolute value obtained is consistent with
the upper limit derived from the helicity drop in the whole AR.

4. Discussion

Fig. 6. AIA image at 1600 Å of the same AR region shown in Fig. 3,
saturated at the intensity of 1180, and overplotted with the contours at
the same value, at the beginning of the X2.2 ﬂare of AR 11158 (top).
Zoom of the vertical magnetic ﬁeld 2D map at the same time, with the
two regions of interest (bottom). Red contours are the same as in the
top panel, only rebinned to the resolution of the magnetic ﬁeld image.
Yellow contours correspond to the magnetic ﬁeld value Bz = 0 G.

within 0.5%, while after the ﬂare this falls to 5%, which should
be attributed to the rearrangement of the magnetic ﬁeld during
the ﬂare, and to a lesser extent, to the evolution of the arc-shaped
RFLH structure just above the green box in Fig. 7. Finally, the
drop in helicity coming from the green box is 20%, a bit less than
in the full FOV, and it corresponds to a value of 1.35 1042 Mx2.
Focusing next to the red box that approximates the ﬂare’s rib-
bons we note that the helicity contained in it is the half of the en-
tire AR. The relative drop in helicity during the ﬂare is similar to
the other curves, ∼ 22 % of its pre-ﬂare value; its absolute value
however is much smaller, corresponding to 7.1 1041 Mx2. This
small relative drop indicates that the region stays non-potential
even after the expulsion of the ﬂux rope. On the other hand, the
higher (absolute) helicity drop within the green box suggests that
the eﬀect of the CME is to change the entire surrounding of the
ﬂux rope. An alternative explanation could be that the eruption
changes the mutual helicity between the systems of the ﬂux rope
and the surrounding ﬁeld, in which case, the RFLH would re-
ﬂect the non-local nature of helicity. This would also relate to
the mutual-to-self conversion of helicity (Tziotziou et al. 2013),
which was suggested for the same active region.

This work dealt with the ﬁrst detailed study of relative ﬁeld line
helicity in a solar active region. The target AR 11158 exhibited
intense activity during the four-days study interval. The compu-
tation of RFLH was based on the relevant recent developments,
and on a high-quality NLFF model for the AR’s coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld, thus ensuring reliable helicity estimations.

The examination of RFLH’s photospheric morphology
showed that this is quite diﬀerent than the respective distribu-
tions of the magnetic ﬁeld and of the electrical current. Further-
more, the morphology of RFLH was shown not to be sensitive
on the employed gauge in its computation. The total AR helicity
as estimated by the RFLH agrees to a large extent with the more
accurate, volume helicity method, as was already demonstrated
before.

Our results are consistent with the picture drawn by other
works on AR 11158, e.g., that of Jing et al. (2012). These authors
ﬁnd a similar helicity evolution, both overall, and during the X-
class ﬂare. The helicity of the AR exhibited a sharp decrease
during the X2.2 ﬂare, ∼ 25% of its pre-ﬂare value. A similar
sharp drop was reported in Jing et al. (2012), which, moreover,
resulted from the respective drop in the right-handed helicity.

The main advantage of using RFLH is the additional spatial
information that it can provide about the locations where helic-
ity is more important, and its respective values. In the case of
the X2.2 ﬂare of AR 11158, we found that the decrease in he-
licity is coming mostly from the wider ﬂux rope area. Addition-
ally, by examining two observationally-deduced, ﬂare-related re-
gions, we were able to monitor the individual helicity evolu-
tion in each of them. The helicity drop during the ﬂare in these
regions did not reveal a clear relation with the helicity of the
observed ICME, although there are many uncertainties in the
derivation of the latter.

As a conclusion, this work pointed out the usefulness of
RFLH in solar applications. The spatial information provided
by RFLH can help in situations such as the one examined in
this paper, i.e., in the determination of the pre-eruptive struc-
tures of coronal mass ejections. A possible next step in the study
of RFLH would be to perform similar analysis to a number of
ARs with diﬀerent levels of activity, and diﬀerent characteristics,
and juxtapose them with the helicity of the associated ICMEs at
1 AU or even much closer in the corona or inner heliosphere with
Parker Solar Probe (Fox et al. 2016) and Solar Orbiter (Müller
et al. 2020). This would enable the examination of the behaviour
of RFLH in diﬀerent environments, and of the possibility of dis-
criminating solar activity with the help of relative ﬁeld line he-
licity.
