Abstract 

The paper proposes a new approach to studying cathodoluminescence spectra of substrate-free 

rare-gas clusters produced in supersonic jets exhausting into a vacuum. The approach, which takes into 

account the fraction of the clustered substance in the jet, is applied to quantitatively analyze integrated 
+)* 
intensities of the luminescence bands of the neutral and charged excimer complexes (Rg2)* and (Rg4

measured for nanoclusters of three rare gases (Rg = Ar, Kr, and Xe) with average sizes ranging from 

100  to  18000  atoms  per  clusters  (diameters  varying  from  2  to  13 nm).  The  amount  of  the  clustered 

substance,  which  affects  the  absolute  values  of  integrated  intensity  of  the  bands,  is  shown  to  be 

proportional  to  the  logarithm  of  the  average  size  of  clusters  in  the  jet.  Analysis  of  normalized 

intensities  allowed  us  to  spectroscopically  find  two  ranges  of  average  sizes  of  Ar,  Kr,  and  Xe 

nanoclusters  which,  in  accordance  with  the  electron  diffraction  studies,  can  be  assigned  to 

quasicrystalline icosahedral and crystalline fcc structures in clusters, as well as to find the cluster size 

range in which both structures coexist. We show that in fcc clusters the luminescence of the neutral 
molecules (Rg2)* comes from within the volume of the cluster, while the charged excimer complexes 

(Rg4

+)* emit mostly from subsurface layers.

1. Introduction 

Clusters,  i.e.  small  aggregations  of  atoms  or  molecules  which  can  be  thought  of  as  an 

intermediate link between single particles and macroscopic solid objects, are of great interest from the 

viewpoint  of  both  fundamental  studies  and  practical  applications  making  use  of  new  cluster 

technologies [1-3]. Being, in a way, nuclei of the macroscopic phase, they allow one to study some of 

the fundamental properties of bulk solids and simulate the kinetics of the processes which result in the 

formation  of  various  macroscopic  structural  states  (see,  e.g.,  [4]).  At  the  same  time,  clusters  have  a 

number  of  unique  properties  which have  never  been  observed  in  bulk  samples.  For  example,  cluster 

properties depend greatly on their size: by varying it, it is possible to change the cluster structure and 

study  the  structural  transformations  [5].  Along  with  the  structural  phases  typical  of  bulk  samples, 

clusters may display some specific structural states, for instance, quasicrystalline structures with a 5-

fold axis of symmetry, which are not reported for bulk objects [6]. 

Weakly  bound  van-der-Waals  rare-gas  clusters  are  good  model  objects  for  studying  the 

electronic  subsystem.  These  clusters  are  known  to  have  a  comparatively  simple  electronic  structure, 

which, as was shown in a number of studies [7-11], is sensitive to their spatial organization. One of the 

most  efficient  methods  of  the  cluster  production  is  adiabatic  exhaustion  of  a  gaseous  jet  through  a 

supersonic  nozzle  into  a  vacuum  (see,  e.g.,  [12]).  An  important  advantage  of  this  technique  is  the 

possibility of generating substrate-free clusters with physical and chemical properties not affected by a 

substrate or a matrix. A convenient way to study the electronic subsystem of such clusters is to employ 

spectroscopic  methods,  including  the  cathodoluminescence  technique  used  in  the  present  study.  The 

technique allows one to effectively investigate the processes of formation of electronic excitations in 

clusters and their subsequent relaxation. 

One  of  the  main  problems  in  studying  clusters  produced  in  supersonic  jets  is  the  complex 

composition of the jet, which contains both substance condensed into clusters of various sizes and a 

residual  gaseous  component.  By  changing  the  jet  flow  regimes  (parameters  of  the  gas  at  the  nozzle 

inlet),  it  is  possible  to  change  the  weighted  average  size  of  the  generated  clusters,  which,  in  many 

aspects, determines their properties (including the structural ones). Yet, in the general case, a change in 

the  flow  regime  will  also  cause  a  change  in  the  level of the substance clustering in the jet (the total 

amount  of  the  clustered  substance),  which,  in  turn,  will  inevitably  impact  the  results  of  the 

measurements.  In  the  case  of  cathodoluminescence  studies,  this  change  will  affect  mostly  integrated 

intensity of the spectral bands, thus making it more difficult to analyze the spectra from the viewpoint 

of evolution of the spectral characteristics accompanying a change in the average cluster size and in 

the  size-related  cluster  structure  and  physical  properties.  To  solve  this  problem,  we  propose  a  new 

approach  to  studying  luminescence  spectra  of  van-der-Waals  clusters,  whose  basic  principles  were 

reported  in  our  short  communication  [13]  based  on  the  experimental  results  obtained  for  clusters  of 

2

 
 
argon. Here, we describe the new approach in more detail and communicate more experimental data 

for clusters of three rare gases – argon, krypton, and xenon. 

2. Experiment 

The paper studies substrate-free nanoclusters of argon, krypton, and xenon produced in gaseous 

jets adiabatically expanding a into a vacuum through a conical supersonic nozzle with a diameter of 

0.34 mm,  opening  angle  of  8.6°,  and  a  ratio  of  the  outlet  cross-section  to  the  critical  one  of  36.7  (a 

more  detailed  description  of  the  experimental  setup  is  available  in  Ref. [14]).  By  varying  the 

temperature  T0  of  the  gas  at  the  nozzle  inlet  while  keeping  the  stagnation  pressure  constant  at 

p0 = 1 atm,  we  produced  beams  with  clusters  of  different  average  sizes  and  structures.  The  clusters 

were excited by electrons in a narrow section of the jet at a distance of 30 mm away from the nozzle 

outlet,  where  their  average  size  (average  number  of  atoms  per  cluster,  N )  was  already  close  to  the 

maximum achievable value in a jet for given p0 and T0 and their structure was a thermodynamically 

equilibrium one. In this section of the jet, the average cluster size  N  can be quantitatively estimated 

with an error of approximately 30% by using this empirical relation (see, e.g., [15]):

In these relations, a0 is the cluster crystal lattice parameter, R is cluster radius, p0 (mbar) and 

T0 (K) are the pressure and temperature of the gas at the nozzle inlet, d (μm) is the critical diameter of 

the  conical  nozzle  (d = 340 μm),  2α  is  the  total  cone  opening  angle  (2α = 8.6°),  deq (μm)  is  the 

equivalent diameter of the nozzle, and kg are the constants characteristic of the gases used (kXe= 5500, 

kKr = 2890, kAr = 1650 [16]). The parameters γ and χ in Eq. (1) are different for different supersonic 

nozzles,  we  used  the  values  γ = 19.5  and  χ = 1.8  that  were  experimentally  verified  in  the  electron 

diffraction  measurements  [17]  for  a  nozzle  identical  to  ours  in  the  range 

*Γ  = 104-105,  that  is  for 

N  = 1⋅103-8⋅104 atoms per cluster (at/cl). 

The size range of the clusters we studied here was 500-8900 at/cl (cluster diameters being 3.3-

8.7 nm) in the case of argon, 100-8500 at/cl (2.1-9.1 nm) in the case of krypton, and 160-18000 at/cl

(amorphous polyicosahedral structure and quasicrystalline structure of the multilayer icosahedron [18, 

19]) and the crystalline fcc structure (with an eventual admixture of hcp phase in the largest clusters 

[20]).  The  temperature  of  clusters  was  virtually  constant  for  all  cluster  sizes:  about  40 K  for  argon, 

60 K for krypton, and 80 K for xenon. 

To obtain the emission spectra, we excited clusters with an electron beam of constant-density 

(Iel ≈ 20 mA) with a subthreshold electron energy Eel = 1 keV, as well as with photons with energy not 

exceeding Eph = 10 eV. The signal was registered in the VUV spectral range with the photon energies 

varying 6 to 11.7 eV. This section of the spectrum contains the main molecular continua related to the 

neutral and charged excited molecular centres (excimer complexes) in Ar, Kr, and Xe clusters. 

3. Results and discussion 

One of the main quantitative parameters of cathodoluminescence spectra is integrated intensity 

of  the  spectral  features  they  contain.  It  provides  valuable  information  on  the  processes  of  formation 

and  relaxation  of  electronic  excitations,  which,  in  the  case  of  clusters,  largely  depend  on  cluster 

composition  and  structure.  Since  integrated  intensity  characterizes  the  total  amount  of  the  excited 

substance clustered in the jet, its value is dependent not only on the physical parameters of one cluster, 

but also on the total number of clusters in the jet. The cluster size, which also determines the cluster 

structure,  depends  on  the  pressure  and  temperature  of  the  gas  mixture  at  the  nozzle  inlet.  Changing 

these  parameters,  one  not  only  changes  the  average  cluster  size  in  the  jet,  but  also  their  number. 

Therefore,  to  analyze  the  processes  occurring  inside  a  cluster,  the  measured  values  of  integrated 

intensity must be normalized, with the normalization factor being the number of clusters in the jet. 

Up  until  now,  the  contribution  of  the  variable  level  of  substance  clustering  in  the  jet  to  the 

intensity of spectral features was not taken into account. In this paper, we study the influence of cluster 

size on cluster spectra and take into consideration the changes in the absolute and relative amount of 

the clustered substance, which accompany any change in the average cluster size in the jet. Our studies 
+)* 
are  focused  on  emission  from  vibrationally  relaxed  states  of  the  neutral  (Rg2)*  and  charged  (Rg4

excimer  complexes  in  clusters  of  three  rare  gases:  Rg = Ar,  Kr  и  Xe.  The  choice  of  the  bands  was 

largely due to their high intensity in the spectra, which minimizes the possible error in the analysis. 

Integrated intensity of an emission band is a function of the excitation cross-section of a unit 

volume of the emitting substance, the flux density of the incident particles used to excite it, and the 

probability  of  implementation  of  the  radiative  relaxation  channel  which  is  responsible  for  the 

formation of the studied band, as well as of the total volume of the substance in which the processes of 

excitation  and  subsequent  radiation  take  place.  When  clusters  are  excited  by  a  constant-density 

electron  beam,  the  integrated  intensity  is  proportional  to  the  cluster  excitation  cross-section,  the 

4

 
 
 
number of excited clusters, and the probability of the electronic relaxation giving rise to the emission 

of the analyzed band: 

I ∼ σexcnclPrad,   

(3) 

here I is the integrated intensity of the emission band, σexc is the excitation cross-section of one cluster, 

ncl is the number of excited clusters, and Prad is the probability of the radiative relaxation channel. The 

parameter Prad is one that contains the main information about the physics of the relaxation processes 

which  occur  in  the  cluster.  To  get  that  information,  we  also  need  to  know  the  number  of  excited 

clusters and the cluster excitation cross-section. 

The  number  of  clusters  ncl  excited  in  the  jet  is  determined  by  the  total  amount  Ncl  of  the 

clustered  substance  in  the  jet  and  the  average  cluster  size  N   in  that  section  of  the  jet  where  it  is 

bombarded by electrons: 

ncl = Ncl /  N .   

The parameter Ncl is a function of the clustering level of the jet substance: 

Ncl = n0 ccl , 

(4) 

(5) 

n0 being the total number of atoms of the jet substance and ccl being the fraction of atoms condensed 

into clusters. Then we have: 

ncl = ccl n0 /  N . 

(6) 

To  find  ccl,  we  use  the  results  obtained  by  B.M. Smirnov  in  Ref. [21],  where  he  estimated 

theoretically the maximum concentration cmax of bound atoms at the end of expansion of pure atomic 

gas in the jet: 

cmax ∼ 

T
*
ε

0

ln Nmax, 

(7) 

here Nmax is the maximum number of atoms in a cluster at the end of the expansion process, T* is the 

condensation onset temperature, and ε0 is the mean binding energy of cluster atoms calculated per one 

atom. For those clusters that are quite large, the mean binding energy is virtually independent of the

cluster size and is close to its value for a macroscopic system, therefore the ratio 

T

 is pretty much 

constant. 

In  our  experiments,  clusters  were  excited  at  a  distance  from  the  nozzle  outlet  where  they 

already  had  an  average  size  close  to  the  maximum  achievable  one  and  their  growth  was  already 

extremely slow. Thus we can assume the maximum cluster size Nmax in the jet to be proportional to the 

weighted average size  N  of the clusters under study, Nmax = A N , so the fraction ccl of the clustered 

substance can be found from Eq. (7) with an accuracy set by the numerical factor A in the logarithmic 

term, ccl ∼ ln A N . In this case, Eq.  (6) can be presented as follows: 

ncl ∼ n0 ln N /  N  + n0 ln A /  N , 

or  

ncl ∼ n0 ln N /  N  

(8) 

(9) 

if we take into account that the second term in Eq.  (8) is negligibly small for the cluster sizes used in 

this study. 

The value n0 is determined by the stagnation pressure p0 (n0 ∼ p0): 

ncl ∼ p0 ln N /  N . 

In our experiments, the pressure p0 was constant, therefore 

ncl ∼ ln N /  N . 

(10) 

(11) 

The cross-section of cluster excitation by electrons, in the general case, is a function of electron 

energy and cluster size. If clusters are excited by electrons having the same energy, the cross-section 

σexc can be considered a geometrical cross-section of cluster, which is proportional to 

3/2N . So, taking 

into account the dependence σexc ∼ 

3/2N  and Eq. (11) for ncl, we arrive to the following expression for 

Eq. (3): 

I ∼ 

3/2N nclPrad ∼ 

3/1−N

ln  N  Prad.

Equation (12) allows us to use the experimentally measured integrated intensity I of a cluster 

luminescence  band  to  calculate  the  value  of  Prad,  which  reflects  the  physical  processes  taking  place 

inside a cluster, and thus being behind the radiative channels under study. 

To analyze the spectra, it would be convenient to separate the logarithmic and the power-law 

dependences and use the normalized integrated intensity I / ln N : 

I / ln N  ∼ 

3/1−N

Prad;   

Prad ∼ 

3/1N I / ln N .

Figure 1  shows  examples  of  cathodoluminescence  spectra  from  crystalline  clusters  of  argon, 

krypton, and xenon of approximately the same size which contain all spectral features studied in the 
paper. The most pronounced bands are related to the radiation of the neutral excimer molecules (Rg2)* 

and charged excimer complexes (Rg4

+)* inside the clusters (Rg = Ar, Kr, Xe).

The (Rg2)* bands reflect the transitions from the lowest vibrationally relaxed level (v = 0) of the 

states  3P1+1S0 (A ∑ +
u

3

1
, B ∑ +
u

) of the excimer molecule (Rg2)* (see, e.g., [14, 22, 23]). This band is 

formed as a result of the realization of one of the relaxation channels available for excited electrons in 

rare-gas cryocrystals, both bulk samples and clusters. Impurities and various defects and imperfections 

of the crystal lattice, including the crystal surface, can greatly intensify the relaxation process. In pure 

bulk  rare-gas  solids  with  a  perfect  crystalline  structure,  it  is  possible  to  observe  at  low  temperature 

transitions  from  both  coherent  and  localized  excitonic  states.  In  the  case  of  clusters,  however, 

7

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
luminescence at the wavelengths of free excitons was only observed for xenon with a small admixture 

of  argon  and  explained  by  formation  of  exciton-impurity  complexes  [24].  In  luminescence  spectra 

from  clusters  of  pure  argon,  krypton,  and  xenon,  only  emission  from  localized  states  has  been 
registered so far, mostly in the form of radiation of the neutral and charged excimer complexes (Rg2)* 
+)*.  This  emission  occurs  from  both  crystalline  clusters  and  clusters  with  an  icosahedral 

and  (Rg4

structure with no translational symmetry in the radial direction. 

In  the  case  of  argon  clusters,  the  radiation  from  the  lowest  vibrationally  relaxed  states  of  the 
(Ar2)*  excimer  is  accompanied  by  “hot”  luminescence  related  to  the  radiative  transitions  from 

vibrationally  excited  states.  This  short-wave  contribution  can  be  presented  as  a  superposition  of  two 

bands,  W′  and  W,  arising  from  the  transitions  from  vibrationally  partially  relaxed  and  non-relaxed 

states of the excimer, respectively [14, 25, 26]. They have to be taken into account to allow for more 
+)*. The short-wave section 
accurate quantitative parameters of the molecular continua (Ar2)* and (Ar4
of the spectrum ends with a narrow band corresponding to the transition from the excited state  3P1 to 
the  ground  state  1S0  in  single  atoms  of  argon  desorbed  from  the  cluster  after  excitation  by  electrons 

[14], as well as in argon atoms from the gaseous fraction of the jet not condensed into clusters. 

The charged complexes (Rg4

+)*, which are responsible for the formation of intense bands in the 
long-wave section of the spectrum, result from the interaction between a molecular ion (Rg2)+ and a 
neutral excimer molecule (Rg2)* [27]. Participation of the ion in the formation of the band is confirmed 

by  the  experiments  with  clusters  excited  by  particles  with  energies  above  and  below  the  cluster 

ionization energy. Figure 2 shows luminescence spectra from clusters of xenon and krypton excited by 

electrons with an energy of 1 keV and photons with energies not exceeding 10 eV. For both krypton 

(Fig. 2a)  and  xenon  (Fig. 2b)  clusters,  the  “red”  satellites  of  the  emission  bands  of  the  excimer 
molecules  (Rg2)*  are  centred  at  7.7 eV  and  6.5 eV,  respectively,  and  disappear  with  the  maximum 

excitation  energy  dropping  below  the  cluster  ionization  energy  (approx.  12 eV  for  krypton  clusters 

with sizes about 1⋅103 at/cl and approx. 10 V for xenon clusters with sizes about 3⋅103 at/cl [29]). 

It is interesting that in bulk samples of argon, krypton, and xenon, even if excited with photons 
+)*  complexes  is 

and  electrons  with  energies  exceeding  that  of  ionization,  no  emission  from  the  (Rg4

observed (see, e.g., [30]). This may be due to the fact that when the atom excitation occurs in the inner 

part of the sample away from its surface, there is a high probability of the atom recombining with the 
+)*  state.  This  radiation,  however,  should  be  significantly 

electron  before  radiating  from  the  (Rg4

facilitated in the subsurface layers of the sample, because in this case it would be much easier for the 

electron  released  during  the  ionization  to  leave  the  sample.  Unlike  clusters,  bulk  samples  have  a 
+)* bands must be 

relatively small fraction of the subsurface volume and thus the intensity of the (Rg4
much lower than that of the neutral band (Rg2)*.

3400 at/cl (b) in the spectral range of the molecular continua (Rg2)* and (Rg4
electrons and photons with energies not exceeding 10 eV. A decrease in the energy of incident particles below 
the  cluster  ionization  energy  results  in  extinction  of  the  emission  band  of  the  charged  excimer  complexes 
+)*, which verifies their ionic nature. The data for krypton clusters were taken from Ref. [28], the spectra for 
(Rg4
xenon clusters were measured in the present study. 

Excitation of crystalline clusters of krypton and xenon by photons with energies below 10 eV 

results  in  the  emission  of  only  one  band  in  the  analyzed spectral range – that of the neutral excimer 
molecules  (Rg2)*,  this  is  shown  schematically  in  Fig. 3a.  Excitation  by  electrons  with  an  energy  of 

1000 eV  leads  to  the  radiation  of  both  the  neutral  and  charged  excimers  from  the  cluster  (Fig. 3b). 

Bombardment  of  bulk  samples  by  electrons  with  the  same  energy  (see,  e.g.,  [31])  gives  rise  to 

emission  dominated  by  the  neutral excimer  molecules (Fig. 3c). The intensity of the radiation of the 
neutral excimer molecule (Rg2)* is expected to be function of the whole volume of the sample (in other 

words,  the  probability  of  implementation  of  this  radiative  channel  will  be  proportional  to  the  total 

number of atoms making up the sample: Prad ∼ N), while that of the charged excimer complex (Rg4
should be dependent on the volume of the sample subsurface layers (Prad ∼ N2/3).

energy  Eel = 1 keV  (b,  c).  In  bulk  samples,  only  radiation  of  the  (Rg2)*  molecules  is  observed  because  the 
subsurface volume of the sample is small in comparison with its whole volume. 

To  verify  these  relations,  we  measured  cathodoluminescence  spectra  from  substrate-free 

clusters  of  argon,  krypton,  and  xenon  in  a  wide  range  of  cluster  sizes  covering  both quasicrystalline 

structures with a 5-fold axis of symmetry and the crystalline fcc structure.

approximately 0.1 eV, the relative intensity of the “hot” luminescence (bands W′ and W) is an order of 

magnitude lower than that in clusters. In the case of bulk samples, the vibrationally relaxed band of the 
neutral excimer (Ar2)* is a superposition of two bands related to the radiative decay of (i) self-trapped 

excitons  (the  component  at  9.78 eV)  and  (ii)  excitons  trapped  by  structural  defects  and  various 

imperfections of the crystalline lattice, including those induced by electrons (the component at 9.6 eV) 

[30].  In  clusters,  the  most  efficient  channel  of  exciton  trapping  is  provided  by  numerous  defects 
formed  during  the  cluster  growth,  therefore  the  (Ar2)*  band  in  Fig. 4а  has  only  the  long-wave 

component at 9.6 eV and can be well described by a single Gaussian. The abnormally high intensity of 

the “hot” luminescence (W′ and W) is apparently due to the great contribution of molecules desorbed 

from the clusters (see, e.g., [14]). Since the surface, where desorption usually occurs, is much larger in 

relative  terms  in  clusters  than  in  bulk  samples,  the  intensity  of  the  bands  related  to  the  vibrationally 

excited states in clusters is also higher. 

Evolution of the neutral and ionic molecular continua (Ar2)* and (Ar4

+)* upon variation in size 

(and  structure)  of  clusters  was  studied  for  argon  clusters  with  the  average  size  ranging  from  500  to 

8900 at/cl.  For  each  value  of  the  average  cluster  size,  several  cathodoluminescence  spectra  were 
measured and used for calculation of the average values of integrated intensities I of the bands (Ar2)* 

and (Ar4

+)*. The size dependences of the intensities normalized by ln  N  in accordance with Eq. (13) 

are shown in Fig. 4b. We can see that both bands are characterized by two ranges of cluster sizes with 

different behaviour of the normalized integrated intensity I / ln N . 

In  the  case  of  bigger  clusters  ( N  ≥ 1800 at/cl),  the  normalized  intensities  tend  to  grow 

nonlinearly with  N . This growth can be well described by a power-law function, I / ln N  ∼ 

αN , with 

α = 2/3 for (Ar2)* and α = 1/3 for (Ar4

+)*. Equation (13) allows us to proceed from I  to  Prad, that is 

from  intensity  to  a  parameter  which  reflects  the  probability  of  the  relevant  molecular  emission  from 

one  cluster.  Then,  for  the  neutral  excimer  molecules  (Ar2)*  we  have  Prad ∼  N   and  for  the  charged 

excimer complexes – Prad ∼ 

3/2N . This actually means that the probability of radiation of the neutral 

excimer from an argon cluster is proportional to the total number of atoms in the cluster, that is to the 

entire cluster volume ( N  ∼ 

3R , Prad ∼ 

3R ,  R  being the average cluster radius), while radiation of the 

charged complex is function of the number of atoms residing in the subsurface layers of the cluster, the 

subsurface volume being proportional to the cluster surface (Prad ∼ 

3/2R ). This is in good agreement 

with the assumption that the radiative decay of the charged excimer complexes should occur mostly in 

near  the  sample  surface,  since  it  is  there  that  the  probability  of  emission  of  the  electrons  released 

during the ionization is the highest, and thus the probability of recombination of these electrons with 

the positively charged complexes is the lowest (see Fig. 3). 

12

 
For  cluster  size  range  1000-1800 at/cl,  there  is  a  transition  from  the  two  power-law 
+)* to a common dependence for 

dependencies of the normalized intensities of the bands (Ar2)* and (Ar4

both bands which, within the experimental error, can be presented as a linear function: I / ln N  ∼  N . 

The  electron  diffraction  measurements  performed  on  argon  clusters  demonstrate  that  clusters  with 

N  ≤ 2000 at/cl have structures with a 5-fold axis of symmetry (amorphous polyicosahedral structure 

and  quasicrystalline  structure  of  multilayer  icosahedron)  [19,  20],  while  larger  clusters  are 

characterized  by  an  fcc  structure  (with  a  possible  admixture  of  the  hcp  phase  in  clusters  with  the 
number of atoms of the order of 104) [20]. This suggests that the different behaviour of the normalized 
+)* bands can be due to the difference in the cluster structure. 
integrated intensity of the (Ar2)* and (Ar4

The  transitional  region  ( N  = 1000-1800 at/cl)  thus  reflects  the  simultaneous  presence  in  the  jet  of 

clusters with a crystalline (fcc) structure and those with a quasicrystalline (icosahedral) structure. The 

latter, which are characterized by the linear dependence of the normalized integrated intensity of both 

molecular continua, prevail in smaller clusters ( N  ≤ 1000 at/cl). 

The  additional  deviation  towards  lower  values  of  the  normalized  intensities  of  the  (Ar2)*  and 

(Ar4

+)* bands for icosahedral clusters ( N  ≤ 1000 at/cl) with respect to how they behave in the case of 

fcc phase can be qualitatively explained by a greater binding energy ε0 of atoms in the cluster with an 

icosahedral  structure  [34],  since  a  variable  ε0  in  Eq. (7)  implies  a  different  expression  for  Eq. (13): 

I / ln N  ∼ 

3/1−N

Prad / ε0. The close values of the intensity of both bands are most probably due to the 

fact  that  in  small  clusters  the  subsurface  layers  with  a  facilitated  emission  of  electrons  occupy  a 

significant volume of the cluster and thus it hardly makes any sense to speak in terms of surface and 

core: the largest clusters from this size range have 900-1000 atoms per cluster and are characterized by 

the  structure  of  multilayer  icosahedron  [18],  which  means  they  are  made  up  of  only  6  atomic  layers 

(Mackay spheres) around the central atom. 

The  cluster  structure  also  affects  the  “hot”-luminescence  band  W′,  which  reflects  transitions 
from partially vibrationally excited levels of the excited neutral excimer molecule (Ar2)* (see Fig. 4d). 

The  contributions  to  the  band  may  come  from  both  excimer  molecules  inside  the  cluster  and  those 

desorbed  from  it  (see  [14,  25]).  The  complexity  of  unequivocal  identification  of  the  band  profile 

complicates analysis of the size dependence of its normalized intensity: in the size range of crystalline 

clusters (1800-8900 at/cl), it can be considered constant (shown in Fig. 4d) or, alternatively, described 

satisfactorily  within  the  experimental  error  by  various  power-law  functions  (or,  rather,  by  a  linear 

combination  of  several  power-law  functions,  as  the  band’s  nature  would  suggest).  Anyway,  a 

qualitative analysis of the W′ band’s behaviour allows us to believe that, just like the emission bands 
+)*,  it  is  sensitive  to  the  cluster  structure  and 
of  the  vibrationally  relaxed  molecules  (Ar2)*  and  (Ar4

indicates  a  transition  from  the  quasicrystalline  phase  to  the  crystalline  one  in  the  same  cluster  size 

range – 1000-1800 at/cl.

3.2. Krypton clusters 

Analysis of the integrated intensities of the emission bands of the neutral and charged excimer 

complexes  in  krypton  clusters  is  shown  in  Figs. 5  and  6.  An  example  of  the  cathodoluminescence 

spectra  in  the  frequency  range  of  the  spectral  bands  is  shown  in  Fig. 5a  for  a  wide  range  of  cluster 

sizes, which covers both icosahedral and fcc phases. Similarly to argon clusters, the radiation intensity 

of the charged complexes is comparable to that of the neutral excimer molecules, this is also the case 

for large clusters.

+)* bands for crystalline 
(fcc)  krypton  clusters  with  8500  atoms  per  cluster  (1)  and  2600  atoms  per  cluster  (2)  and  quasicrystalline 
(icosahedral) clusters sized 1000 at/cl (3) and 290 at/cl (4) (a).Normalized intensity I / ln N  of the band (Kr2)* 
versus average cluster size  N  (b). 

The  normalized  integrated  intensity  curve  of  the  (Kr2)*  band  averaged  over  a  series  of 

measurements  is  shown  in  Fig. 5b  for  the  entire  range  of  cluster  sizes  studied  (100-8500 at/cl).  Just 

like  in  the  case  of  argon  clusters,  here  too  we  can  see  two  ranges  of  cluster  sizes  with  qualitatively 
14

 
 
 
 
 
 
different  behaviour  of  the  intensity  and  an  intermediate  range  in  between.  For  clusters  with 

3/2N ,  which,  see  Eq. (13),  implies  the 
N  ≥ 1500 at/cl,  the  normalized  intensity  is  proportional  to 
probability of radiation of the neutral molecule (Kr2)* from inside a cluster being proportional to the 

whole  cluster  volume  (Prad ∼  N ).  In  the  case  of  small  clusters  with  N  ≤ 600 at/cl,  the  normalized 

intensity  can  be  seen,  within  the  experimental  and  calculating  error,  as  a  linear  function.  The 

transitional region between the two types of curves thus refers to clusters with the average size ranging 

from  600  to  1500 at/cl.  This  corresponds  with  the  electron  diffraction  data  [35],  according  to  which 

clusters  of  krypton  sized  some  2000 at/cl  and  more  have  predominantly  fcc  structure,  while  smaller 

clusters have a broad intermediate size range between the quasicrystalline phase with an icosahedral 

structure and the crystalline fcc phase.

The  data  on  the  normalized  integrated  intensity  of  the  emission  band  of  the  charged  excimer 
+)*  for  the  whole  range  of  cluster  sizes  are  reported  in  Fig. 6.  Here,  for  clusters  with 

complexes  (Kr4

15

 
 
 
 
 
N  ≥ 1500 at/cl,  the  normalized  intensity  can  be  described  by  the  function  I / ln N  ∼ 
+)*  band,  in  analogy  with  the  (Ar4

means  that  the  probability  of  radiation  of  the  (Kr4

3/1N ,  which 
+)*  band,  is 

proportional  to  the  cluster  surface  area  and,  therefore,  the  charged  excimer  complexes  in  krypton 

radiate most effectively from some subsurface volume of the crystalline cluster. 

If  we  take  a  look  at  small  clusters,  N  ≤ 600 at/cl,  we  will  see  that  the  normalized  intensity 

changes  its  behaviour,  like  it  is  shown  on  a  larger  scale  in  Fig. 6b.  In  virtually  all  this  region, 

corresponding  to  the  icosahedral  cluster  structure,  the  normalized  intensity  data  fall  into  a  linear  fit 

line: I / ln N  ∼  N .

+)* bands for crystalline 
(fcc) xenon clusters with 18000 atoms per cluster (1), 6200 atoms per cluster (2), and 3500 atoms per cluster (3)

Let us now consider the similar measurements for clusters of xenon (see Figs. 7 and 8). Typical 
cathodoluminescence  spectra  with  the  molecular  continua  of  the  neutral  and  charged  (Xe2)*  and 
+)*  for  icosahedral  and  crystalline  clusters  of  different  sizes  are  shown  in  Fig. 7a.  The  emission 

(Xe4

band  of  the  charged  excimer  complexes  also  has  a  significant  intensity  which  is  close  to  that  of  the 
+)* band are shown in 

band of the neutral excimers. The curves of the normalized intensity of the (Xe4

Fig. 7b for clusters with sizes ranging from 160 to 18000 at/cl. We can see three cluster size ranges, 

each  with  its  own  intensity  evolution:  (i) a  size  range  of  crystalline  clusters  ( N  ≥ 3000 at/cl)  with 

I / ln N  ∼ 

3/2N , which implies that this type of radiation is formed in the entire cluster volume; (ii) a 

size range of icosahedral clusters ( N  ≤ 1000 at/cl) with a linear intensity, which reflects a change in 

the atom binding energy caused by the change in cluster structure, and (iii) an intermediate size range 

(1000 ≤  N  ≤ 3000 at/cl), which suggests that clusters of both phases are present in the jet.

+)* versus average cluster size in the whole range

The evolution of the (Xe4

+)* band is shown in Fig. 8. The function I / ln N  ∼ 

3/1N , typical of 

the molecules emitting from subsurface layers is observed for crystalline clusters (Fig. 8a), while the 

linear behaviour of the normalized intensity of the band related to the charged excimer complexes is 

thus  characteristic  of  icosahedral  clusters  (Fig. 8b).  For  both  krypton  and  xenon  clusters,  the 

experimental  data  did  not  allow  us  to  clearly  establish  the  cluster  size  range  which  is  “transitional” 

between  the  two  structures.  Yet,  the  transition  itself  is  quite  evident  and  falls  into  the  average  size 

range that follows from the analysis of the bands of the neutral excimers in these clusters. 

4. Conclusions 

The  present  study  deals  with  cathodo-  and  photoluminescence  spectra  in  the  VUV  frequency 
+)*  in 

range  of  the  emission  bands  of  the  neutral  and  charged  excimer  complexes  (Rg2)*  and  (Rg4

substrate-free nanoclusters of argon, krypton, and xenon with average sizes varying from 100 to 18000 

atoms per cluster to include the cluster size ranges of both quasicrystalline icosahedral and crystalline 

fcc  structures.  To  quantitatively  analyze  the  integrated  intensity  I  of  these  bands,  we  apply  our  new 

approach which takes into account the amount of the clustered substance in the supersonic jet. 

The obtained experimental results allow us to demonstrate that the fraction ccl of the substance 

condensed into clusters is proportional to logarithm of the average cluster size  N  in the jet, ccl ∼ ln N . 

This  finding  makes  it  possible  to  use  the  cathodoluminescence  spectra  to  establish  the  cluster  size 

ranges  which  correspond  to  quasicrystalline  clusters  with  a  5-fold  axis  of  symmetry  (multilayer 

icosahedron  and  amorphous  polyicosahedral  structure)  and  crystalline  fcc  clusters.  The  proposed 

technique can also be used to study the intermediate cluster size range with both icosahedral and fcc 

clusters present in the jet. 

We  find  that  in  crystalline  clusters  of  argon,  krypton,  and  xenon  the  radiation  of  the 
vibrationally  relaxed  neutral  excimer  molecules  (Rg2)*  occurs  from  within  the  whole  cluster 

(I / ln N  ∼ 

3/2N ),  while  the  charged  excimer  complexes  (Rg4

+)*  emit  from  some  subsurface  layers 

(I / ln N  ∼ 

3/1N ). 

The obtained results suggest that the proposed approach can be used for spectroscopic analysis 

of more complex rare-gas systems and some simple molecular substances, which can also shed light on 

their  structure.  The  new  approach  is  expected  to  be  helpful  in  opening  up  new  ways  for  complex 

studies  of  nanoclusters  which  combine  spectroscopic  (cathodoluminescence)  and  structural  (electron 

diffraction) techniques.
