Abstract 

Si-doped GaN films were grown on c-sapphire by rf magnetron reactive co-sputtering 

of GaAs and Si at various partial pressures of N2 in Ar-N2 growth atmosphere and their epitaxial 

character was ascertained by phi-scans. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy revealed ~2 at.% 

Si in all the films, but the N/Ga ratio decreased substantially as N2 percentage was reduced 

from 100% to 10%. High resolution x-ray diffraction revealed the dominant presence of edge 

dislocations (~1012 cm-2) in the films grown at 30% - 100% N2, which decreased to ~5 × 1011 

cm-2 at lower N2 percentages, at which, the density of screw dislocations was found to increase 

and attained values comparable to that of edge dislocations. The lattice parameters (a and c) 

were obtained independently to determine the in-plane and out-of-plane components of strain 

in films, which were analyzed to deduce the hydrostatic and biaxial strain contributions. The 

film  grown  at  100%  N2  displayed  large  micro-strain  and  hydrostatic  strain  due  to 

excess/interstitial nitrogen, both of which decreased with the initial reduction of N2 percentage, 

but increased again below 30% N2 due to Ar incorporation. The films grown above 75% N2 

displayed compressive biaxial stress, which is attributed to possible nitrogen incorporation into 

grain boundaries and tensile side of edge dislocations. The reversal of biaxial stress to tensile 

character in films grown below 75% N2 is explained by the prevalence of in-plane tensile stress 

generated  during  coalescence.  The  tensile  stress  decreased  in  films  grown  below  30%  N2, 

which is ascribed to the Ar incorporation and voided morphology. The presence of Si in the 

films does not have a significant influence on strain behaviour and appears to be masked by 

the dominant growth-related intrinsic effects.

1. Introduction 

GaN  and  related  III-V  alloys  have  received  exceptional  attention  as  futuristic 

semiconductor materials, owing to the wide range of their current and potential applications, 

extending from short wavelength optoelectronics and white light sources to high power and 

high frequency transistors [1-4]. The ever-increasing scope of GaN calls for exploring non-

conventional  approaches  of  material  growth  and  controlled  in-situ  doping,  as  well  as  the 

improved understanding of its structural properties, particularly those obtained by alternative 

methods.  GaN  films  have  been  grown  by  metal-organic  chemical  vapor  deposition 

(MOCVD/MOVPE) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) mostly on sapphire substrate, despite 

the substantial mismatch between lattice constants and coefficients of thermal expansion [5]. 

The heteroepitaxial GaN films have often revealed high density of threading dislocations in the 

range  of  108  -  1010  cm-2 [6-8],  but  unlike  most  other  compound  semiconductors,  have  been 

successfully utilized to fabricate high quality optoelectronic devices [9, 10]. However, due to 

limitations of high temperature operation in MOCVD and the scalability and high cost of MBE, 

alternative methods, such as sputtering have become attractive and continue to be explored for 

the growth of GaN [11-15]. In recent years, sputtering has demonstrated considerable promise 

for the growth of epitaxial GaN films, albeit with threading dislocations in the range of 109-

1012 cm-2 [16-18] and has been employed for obtaining undoped [16, 18, 19] and doped (with 

Si, Ge and Mg) [17, 20-22] GaN films, as well as fabrication of GaN based LEDs [23].  

Silicon (Si) is a commonly used n-type dopant in GaN, yielding carrier concentrations 

as high as ~2 × 1020 cm-3 in the films grown by different techniques and is used in various 

device structures [20, 24-26]. In an earlier work from our group, Si-doped GaN films have been 

grown by reactive co-sputtering of GaAs and Si [21], displaying resistivity in the range of 10-

3 -  1  Ω-cm,  depending  on  the  Si  area  coverage  of  GaAs  target  and  N2  percentage  in  Ar-N2 

growth atmosphere. More recently, sputtered Si-doped GaN films [27], containing ~2 at.% Si 

have been grown by this approach, which revealed concurrent increase of carrier concentration 

and mobility with reduction of N2 percentage in growth atmosphere from 100% to 10%, and 

displayed high conductivity, with carrier concentration ≳1020 cm-3 and mobility ≳20 cm2V-1s-

1  in films grown at ~10% N2. As GaN based optoelectronic and electronic devices are mostly 

fabricated on sapphire or Si substrates, the presence of substantial strain in doped GaN films 

often influences their electrical and optical behaviour and is a potential cause of degradation in 

device performance [28]. The covalent radius of Si (1.11 Å) is smaller than that of Ga (1.26 

Å), which is normally expected to cause a decrease in lattice parameters. It has however been 

shown [29, 30] by first-principles calculations that the net strain due to the substitution of Si in 

2 

 
GaN  lattice  is  negligibly  small,  since  the  effects  due  to  size  and  deformation  potentials  are 

nearly similar in magnitudes but opposite in sign. Strain measurements of Si-doped GaN films 

on  sapphire  by  several  workers  [29,  31-38]  have  also  found  marginal  effects  due  to  Si 

incorporation, but on the other hand, have widely reported the relaxation of in-plane (biaxial) 

compressive stress, or its change to tensile character, as will be summarized below. It may be 

mentioned  here  that  measurement  of  strain  in  Si-doped  GaN  films  grown  by  alternative 

approaches like sputtering, has not been reported.  

Early studies of strain in MOCVD/MOVPE grown Si-doped GaN films on sapphire by 

out-of-plane XRD measurements revealed the presence of compressive biaxial stress, which 

relaxed with the incorporation of Si [31-34]. Cremades et al. [35] used XRD measurements of 

symmetric  and  asymmetric  reflections  to  independently  deduce  the  a  and  c  parameters  of 

MOCVD  grown  Si-doped  GaN  with  different  doping  concentrations  and  found  that  the 

incorporation of Si in GaN not only led to stress relaxation, but also induced in-plane tensile 

stress in the films with higher carrier concentrations (n > 1018 cm-3). They also observed a shift 

towards higher lattice constants and ascribed it to tensile hydrostatical pressure due to point 

defects  [35].  Romano  et  al.  [29]  have  also  investigated  the  doping  effect  of  Si  on  the 

microstructure and strain behavior in MOCVD grown GaN films by obtaining the in-plane and 

out-of-plane components of strain and have observed the reversal of compressive biaxial strain 

to tensile, with increase of Si concentration. They have ascribed the strain reversal to crystallite 

coalescence effects, in accordance with the Nix and Clemens model for polycrystalline films 

[39], while ruling out any effect due Si incorporation. The stress studies in Si and Ge doped 

GaN films have also been shown [36] to result in a relatively larger increase of in-plane tensile 

strain with Si concentration. However, Xie et al. [37] have argued that the tensile strain in Si-

doped  GaN  films  depends  on  the  free  carrier  concentration.  In  another  study  on  Si-doped 

AlGaN films, Forghani et al. [38] have proposed that the tensile strain in Si-doped (Al)GaN 

epitaxial films may be attributed to the incorporation of Si on the compressive side of edge 

dislocations. The above studies show that Si doping in GaN films on sapphire usually induces 

in-plane tensile stress, although the reasons for the same are not evident. It may however be 

noted that growth-related intrinsic stresses, such as, those generated during coalescence or due 

to point defects and microstructure related effects have not been considered in most of these 

studies,  but  may  have  a  significant  role  in  determining  the  residual  stress  in  Si-doped  GaN 

films.  It  may  be  relevant  to  note  that  the  investigations  of  undoped  GaN  films  grown  on 

sapphire  by  different  methods  by  Kisielowski  et  al.  [40]  have  shown  that  both  biaxial  and 
hydrostatic strains may be concurrently present in these films. Joachim et al. [41] have also 

3 

 
shown the presence of hydrostatic strain in MOCVD and MBE grown GaN films and attributed 

it to point defects. Based on high resolution x-ray diffraction studies of GaN films grown over 

Ga1-xNx buffer layer on sapphire and subsequent analysis of strain data, Harutyunyan et al. [42] 

have also inferred that both hydrostatic and biaxial strains are present in these films.  

We  have  recently  shown  that  hydrostatic  as  well  as  biaxial  strains  are  concurrently 

present in undoped epitaxial GaN films grown on c-sapphire by reactive sputtering at different 

partial pressures of N2 (10% - 100%) in a growth atmosphere consisting of Ar-N2 mixture; and 

both of these are strongly influenced by the microstructure and defects present in the films [18]. 

The  films  grown  at  high  N2  percentages  (~100%)  displayed  large  hydrostatic  strain  and 

compressive biaxial stress, which were ascribed to the presence of nitrogen interstitials. With 

the  reduction  of  N2  percentage  in  growth  atmosphere,  the  hydrostatic  strain  in  the  films 

decreased substantially, along with the reversal of compressive biaxial residual stress to tensile, 

which  was  primarily  ascribed  to  growth-related  effects  during  crystallite  coalescence.  As 

mentioned above, in the case of epitaxial Si-doped GaN films, investigations of the dependence 

of residual stress on microstructure and defects and in particular, the role of intrinsic growth-

related effects are quite limited. Furthermore, the study of residual stress in sputtered Si-doped 

GaN films and its dependence on growth atmosphere becomes  more important, because the 

stress in sputtered films is known to be strongly influenced by the pressure and composition of 

growth  atmosphere  [43,  44].  The  present  study  thus  attempts  to  investigate  the  nature  and 

dependence  of  the  residual  stress  in  sputtered  epitaxial  Si-doped  GaN  films  on  the  partial 

pressure of N2 in growth atmosphere. Our results reveal the concurrent presence of hydrostatic 

and  compressive  biaxial  strains  in  the  films  grown  at  high  N2  percentages  (>50%),  which 

appear to be unaffected by Si incorporation. On the other hand, at lower N2 percentages, the 

films  display  a  dominant  intrinsic  tensile  stress  generated  during  coalescence,  which  is 

influenced by the microstructure and morphology of films, as well as, possible effects due to 

the incorporation of Si, Ar and excess nitrogen, depending upon the growth conditions. 

2. Experimental details 

Si-doped epitaxial GaN films were grown by reactive rf magnetron sputtering of GaAs 

and Si, as described earlier [21]. The Si area coverage of the erosion track of GaAs was fixed 

at ~5%, based on earlier results, which have indicated the deterioration of the structural quality 

of films grown with larger area coverages [21]. All the films were grown at 700 °C in Ar-N2 

mixture  (total  pressure,  0.86  Pa)  over  approximately  50  nm  thick  GaN  buffer  layers  on  c-

sapphire substrate, which were grown in 100% N2 at 300 °C. The Si-doped GaN films were 

4 

 
grown at different nitrogen partial pressures in the range of 0.086 Pa to 0.86 Pa, by changing 

the corresponding N2 percentage in growth atmosphere from 10% to 100%. Accordingly, the 

N2 percentage during growth will be used to label the films grown at various partial pressures 

of N2 in this work. The RF power was adjusted to maintain the growth rate of films at (1.0 ± 

0.1) μm hr-1, as the Ar percentage in growth atmosphere was increased. The film thickness was 

maintained in the range of 850 - 900 nm, implying nearly constant Ga deposition flux. With 

the reduction of N2 in growth atmosphere from 100% to 10%, the ratio of nitrogen impingement 

flux to Ga deposition flux decreased from ~2 × 103 to ~2 × 102. 

The  Si  content  in  doped  GaN  films  was  investigated  by  energy  dispersive  x-ray 

spectroscopy  (EDX)  using  JEOL  JSM-7600F  Field  Emission  Gun-Scanning  Electron 

Microscope. High resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD) measurements were carried out with 

a Cu rotating anode (9 kW), RIGAKU-Smart Lab-X-Ray diffractometer. The a-parameter of 

the films was obtained from ω-2 scans of an asymmetric reflection, which was achieved by 

tilting the film about χ axis, followed by the optimization of ϕ, ω, and χ. The a-parameter was 

also confirmed by in-plane measurements. The c-parameter was obtained from ω-2 scans of 

symmetric  (0002),  (0004),  and  (0006)  reflections.  The  ω  and  ω-2    scans  of  symmetric 

reflections were respectively used to obtain the mosaic tilt and micro-strain in the films. The 
mosaic twist was obtained in ϕ-rocking curve geometry by in-plane measurement of (112̅0) 

reflection,  using  parallel  slit  collimator  (PSC_1°)  and  analyzer  (PSA_1°).  Atomic  force 

microscopy (AFM) was caried out in contact mode with Nanoscope IV Multimode scanning 

probe to study the surface morphology over an area of 2 μm × 2 μm. 

3. Results and Discussion 

The  composition  of  Si-doped  GaN  films  was  investigated  by  EDX  and  the 

corresponding data (along with that of a commercially procured, MOCVD grown GaN film) is 

presented in Fig. S1 and Table S1 of supplementary material. It is seen that the measured N/Ga 

ratio in commercial GaN film is 0.70, while that for the Si-doped GaN films decreases from 

0.76 to 0.69, with the reduction of N2 in growth atmosphere from 100% to 10%. The EDX data 

also confirm the absence of arsenic and the presence of oxygen impurity (~3 at.%) in all the 

films. These results are in agreement with earlier x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 

secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) studies of undoped GaN films [18, 45], which also 

indicated the possibility of excess nitrogen in the films grown at higher N2 percentages. All the 

films,  which  were  grown  with  5%  Si  area  coverage,  reveal  the  presence  of  ~2  at.%  Si, 
irrespective of N2 percentage in growth atmosphere. Phi (ϕ) scans of (101̅1) reflection of GaN 

5 

 
were carried out to assess the epitaxial character and quality of Si-doped GaN films obtained 

at various N2 percentages in growth atmosphere and are shown as Fig. S2 of supplementary 
material. All the films exhibit the six (101̅1) peaks at intervals of 60°. The ϕ-scan of (101̅4) 

peaks of sapphire, which is also shown in the figure, reveals that these peaks are rotated by 30° 

with  respect  to  the  GaN  peaks,  thus  conforming  to  the  in-plane  epitaxial  relationship  of 
GaN[112̅0]║α-Al2O3[101̅0] [46]. These results indicate the alignment of GaN lattice with the 

oxygen sub-lattice of sapphire and confirm the epitaxial character and mosaic structure of the 

films. 

Figure 1(a) shows ω-2 high-resolution scans for symmetric (0002), (0004) and (0006) 

reflections  of  GaN,  from  which  the  average  values  of  c-parameter  for  all  the  films  were 

obtained, with an uncertainty of ± 0.001 Å. For the determination of a-parameter of the films, 

the ω-2 high-resolution (101̅1) asymmetric scans and the in-plane measurements of (112̅0) 

and  (202̅0)  reflections  were  carried  out.  Figure  1(b)  shows  the  ω-2  asymmetric  scans  of 

(101̅1) reflection for all the films, while the corresponding in-plane data for (112̅0) and (202̅0) 

reflections are shown in supplementary material as Fig. S3. These measurements were used to 

obtain the average values of a-parameter of the films, with an uncertainty of ± 0.002 Å. The 

reproducibility of measurements was confirmed by analyzing multiple films grown at each N2 

percentage. Fig. S4 shows the values of the lattice parameters, a and c (average with error bars), 

which are plotted against Ar and N2 percentages in growth atmosphere.  

The  microstructural  parameters  of  the  films,  namely,  the  out-of-plane  micro-strain, 

mosaic tilt and twist were obtained by HRXRD measurements and these results are shown for 

typical cases, in Figs. 2 – 4 and are summarized in Fig. 5. Figure 2(a) shows the ω-2 scans of 

symmetric  (0002),  (0004)  and  (0006)  reflections  and  the  Williamson-Hall  plots  of  the 

corresponding  reciprocal  space  broadening,  Δqz  versus  the  magnitude  of  reciprocal  lattice 

vector (q) are shown in Fig. 2(b), from which the out-of-plane micro-strain was obtained. A 

relatively large full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ω-2 peaks is seen in the film grown 

at 100% N2, which decreases initially with the reduction of N2 percentage, as is typically shown 

for 50% N2. However, the FWHM’s of ω-2 peaks are found to increase slightly at lower N2 

percentages. Figure 3(a) shows the ω scans of symmetric (0002), (0004) and (0006) reflections 

and the Williamson-Hall plots of the corresponding reciprocal space broadening, Δqx versus q 

are shown in  Fig. 3(b), from which the mosaic tilt was obtained.  In this case also,  the  film 

grown at 100% N2 displays a relatively large FWHM of ω scans, which decreases substantially 

for films grown in the range of 50% - 75% N2, but again displays a slight increase, as is shown 

6 

 
typically  for  30%  and  10%  N2.  Figure  4  shows  the  in-plane  ϕ-rocking  curves  of  (112̅0) 

reflection, from which, the mosaic twist of the films was obtained. The ϕ-rocking curve of film 

grown at 100% N2 displays a large FWHM, which decreases slightly to nearly the same values 

for films grown in the range of 30% - 75% N2. However, below 30% N2, the FWHM decreases 

substantially (shown typically for 10% N2), indicating a significantly reduced mosaic twist. 

The  mosaic  tilt  and  twist  values  obtained  from  above  were  used  to  calculate  the 

densities of screw and edge dislocations [47], which along with the micro-strain are plotted in 

Fig. 5, against Ar and N2 percentages in growth atmosphere. It may be mentioned here that in 

hexagonal systems, including GaN, the density of edge dislocations dominates over the density 

of screw dislocations [48, 49], which was also observed in the case of undoped sputtered GaN 

epitaxial films [18]. Figure 5 shows high densities of edge (~3 × 1012 cm-2) and screw (~5 × 

1011 cm-2) dislocations in the film grown at 100% N2, both of which decrease slightly as N2 is 

reduced  to  the  range  of  30%  -  50%.  Interestingly,  below  30%  N2,  the  density  of  edge 

dislocations continues to decrease, but that of screw dislocations tends to increase, thus both 

attaining comparable values in the range of (3 - 5) × 1011 cm-2, for the film grown at 10% N2. 

Figure 5 also shows that a large micro-strain (~1.5 × 10-2) is present in the film grown at 100% 

N2. As N2 is reduced to ~50%, the micro-strain decreases substantially (~2 × 10-3), but again 

increases marginally with reduction of N2 below 30%. The presence of substantial micro-strain 

is  attributed  to  the  high  density  of  screw  dislocations  in  these  films  [50].  However,  as  the 

sputtering of GaAs was carried out in Ar-N2 atmosphere of a widely varying composition (10% 

- 100% N2), there is also a possibility of the incorporation of excess nitrogen and/or argon in 

the films, depending on the N2 /Ar ratio, which may also contribute to the micro-strain [51, 52], 

as will be discussed below.  

The morphology of Si-doped GaN films grown at different N2 percentages in growth 

atmosphere  was  also  investigated  and  the  results  are  shown  for  typical  cases  in  Fig.  S5  of 

supplementary material, along with the corresponding root mean square (rms) roughness of the 

films.  The  morphology  of  films  grown  in  the  range  of  30%  -  100%  N2  are  nearly  similar, 

displaying uniform and well-rounded lateral surface features, along with rms roughness of 3-5 

nm. For the films grown at 20% - 30% N2, the lateral features become asymmetric and irregular, 

the surface morphology  becomes slightly voided and rms roughness increases substantially. 

Interestingly, in the films grown at lower than 20% N2, well-rounded, symmetric lateral surface 

features are again seen, but with a substantially voided surface morphology, which results in 

the high values of their rms roughness (15-20 nm). Since the growth rate of the films was nearly 

7 

 
constant, the changes in surface morphology with reduction of N2 percentage are ascribed to 

the increasing effect of Ar bombardment [53]. 

The values of the measured in-plane strain (𝜀1 = (a - 𝑎0)/ 𝑎0) and out-of-plane strain 

(𝜀2 = (c - 𝑐0)/ 𝑐0) were obtained from the data in Fig. S4 and are plotted in Fig. 6, against Ar 

and N2 percentages in growth atmosphere, where, 𝑎0 (3.189 Å) and 𝑐0 (5.185 Å) represent the 
unstrained lattice parameters. The extrinsic in-plane (biaxial) strain (𝜀th ≃ -1.28 x 10-3), due to 
the difference in coefficients of thermal expansion of GaN and c-sapphire (5.59 × 10-6 K-1 and 

7.5 × 10-6 K-1, respectively) corresponding to ΔT = 670 K (the difference between growth and 

room  temperatures)  is  compressive  in  the  present  case,  and  is  also  shown  in  Fig.  6  by  a 

horizontal line. The film grown at 100% N2 shows a relatively large out-of-plane tensile strain 

(~5 × 10-3), which becomes slightly compressive in those grown in the range of 20% - 50% N2, 

but regains mildly tensile character at lower N2 percentages. On the other hand, the in-plane 

strain in the film grown at 100% N2 is compressive (-2.2 × 10-3), which becomes tensile as N2 

is  reduced  below  75%.  It  attains  the  highest  value  of  ~2.5  ×  10-3  at  30%  N2,  but 

decreases substantially at lower N2 percentages.  

It is noted from Fig. 6 that the measured in-plane and out-of-plane strains do not display 

solely hydrostatic (𝜀1 = 𝜀2) or biaxial (𝜀2/𝜀1 ≃ - 0.53 for GaN [54, 55]) character in any of the 

films, indicating that both these contributions to strain are concurrently present. It is known 

that point defects like, VGa, VN, Gai, Ni, NGa, GaN, [56] and O interstitials [57] are present in 

epitaxial  GaN  films.  As  mentioned  above,  there  is  also  a  possibility  of  the  substantial 

incorporation of excess nitrogen and/or argon in the films, depending on the N2/Ar ratio during 

growth.  The hydrostatic strain may in general, originate from the above mentioned defects and 

impurities, causing expansive or compressive strain in wurtzite GaN. On the other hand, the 

in-plane  biaxial  strain  can  be  extrinsic,  due  to  the  substantial  difference  between  the 

coefficients of thermal expansion of GaN and sapphire or can also be intrinsic, due growth-

related  effects,  including  the  in-plane  tensile  stress  generated  during  coalescence.  Thus, 

considering the concurrent presence of hydrostatic and biaxial strains, the measured strain data 

of  these  films  and  its  dependences  on  N2/Ar  ratio  during  growth  have  been  quantitatively 

analyzed. In such a situation, the measured in-plane and out-of-plane components of strain (𝜀1 

and 𝜀2), are given by [40, 42]  

                                                        𝜀1 = 𝜀1b + 𝜀h                                                       (1) 

                                                        𝜀2 = 𝜀2b + 𝜀h                                                        (2)

while, 𝜀h is the hydrostatic strain, given by

and ν {= 𝑐13/(𝑐13 + 𝑐33)}is the Poisson ratio. For GaN, 𝑐13 = 106 GPa and 𝑐33 = 398 GPa are 

the values of elastic constants and ν is ~0.21 [42, 54]. Equations (1)-(3) were used to obtain the 

hydrostatic  and  biaxial  strain  contributions  in  all  the  films.  The  effect  of  thermal  strain 

contribution (𝜀th)  was  eliminated from the biaxial strain component (𝜀1b), which is elastically 

related to the biaxial strain component 𝜀2b (= -(2𝑐13/𝑐33)𝜀1b) [55], by subtracting 𝜀th from 𝜀1b.

Figure  7  shows  the  variations  of  𝜀h,  𝜀1b

growth atmosphere and their behaviour is summarized below. The plot of 𝜀h in Fig. 7(a) shows 
a large hydrostatic strain (~2.5 × 10-3) in the film grown at 100% N2. As N2 is reduced to 50%, 
−  
𝜀h decreases below 10-3 and increases slightly below 30% N2. The corresponding plots of 𝜀1b
and 𝜀2b are shown in Fig. 7(b). A large value of 𝜀2b (~2.5 × 10-3) is seen in the film grown at 
100 % N2, implying a tensile out-of-plane strain. Interestingly, with reduction of N2 to ~30%, 
𝜀2b changes its character from tensile to compressive (-10-3), but again becomes slightly tensile 
(~3.5 × 10-4) in the film grown at 10% N2. The intrinsic biaxial stress (𝜎f)  was obtained from 
− ) in Fig. 7(b), and is plotted in Fig. 7(c), which 
the growth-related, intrinsic in-plane strain (𝜀1b
shows that the film grown at 100% N2 possesses a relatively large compressive intrinsic stress 
−  ≈ - 3.4 × 10-3). However, the intrinsic compressive stress 𝜎f reverses its 
𝜎f ≈ - 1.6 GPa (𝜀1b
character to tensile below 75% N2 and remains so in the films grown in the range of 30% - 50% 
−  of (2 - 3) × 10-3). However, 𝜎f decreases to 

N2, with 𝜎f being in the range of 0.9 - 1.7 GPa (𝜀1b
≈ 0.3 GPa, as N2 in growth atmosphere is further reduced to ~10%. 

It  is  evident  from  above that the  Si-doped  GaN  films grown at  high N2 percentages 

(75% - 100 %) display  large  hydrostatic strain (>10-3), which relaxes  substantially with  the 

reduction of N2 percentage and tends to increase again in the films grown at 10% - 20% N2. 

Interestingly, this behaviour is quite similar to that of the micro-strain, as shown in Fig. 5. The 

hydrostatic strain in GaN films, which is characterized by the concomitant increase of a and c 

9 

 
has  been  ascribed  to  the  presence  of  self-interstitials  [58],  as  was  also  reported  recently  in 

undoped GaN films grown by sputtering [18]. As the EDX measurements have indicated, the 

films grown at N2 percentages ≳75% are likely to contain excess/interstitial nitrogen, which 

decreases with the reduction of N2 percentage in growth atmosphere. Thus, in the film grown 

at 100% N2 which has the highest N/Ga ratio, the large hydrostatic strain and micro-strain are 

attributed to excess/interstitial nitrogen; and their subsequent decrease at lower N2 percentages 

to the reduction of N/Ga ratio. Figure 7(a) also shows a slight increase of hydrostatic strain in 

the films grown at 10% - 20% N2, as is also seen in the case of micro-strain in Fig. 5, which is 

attributed to the incorporation of Ar in these films, as these are grown at high Ar percentages 

(80% - 90%). There is no evidence of compressive hydrostatic effect due to the incorporation 

of Si in these films, which is in tune with the theoretical predictions mentioned above; and in 

any case, it is likely to be masked by the dominant and expansive hydrostatic strain due to the 

presence of interstitial nitrogen and/or argon. 

Figure 7(c) shows that that an intrinsic biaxial stress is present in Si-doped GaN films, 

which  in  most  of  the  cases,  is  tensile  in  character,  except  for  the  films  grown  at  high  N2 

percentages (75% - 100%). This is in agreement with the studies on MOCVD grown Si-doped 

GaN films described above, in which a tensile biaxial stress has been usually reported. This 

behaviour is also similar to that observed in our earlier work [18] on undoped GaN films grown 

by  sputtering,  which  was  attributed  to  the  growth-related  tensile  stress  generated  during 

coalescence. The growth-related intrinsic tensile stress in polycrystalline thin films is known 

to develop during crystallite coalescence, due to the attraction between crystallites [39]. Nix 

and Clemens [39] have proposed a quantitative model under low adatom mobility condition, 

and have asserted that the tensile stress developed during crystallite coalescence is maintained 

during film growth. It has also been reported [59, 60] that edge type threading dislocations of 

high  density  (~1010  cm-2)  are  formed  at  the  coalescence  stage  during  the  mosaic  growth  of 

epitaxial GaN films, which subsequently lead to low-angle grain boundaries that are rotated 

about the c-axis. Potin et al. [60] have also observed high-angle grain boundaries arising from 

the  local  arrangements  of  threading  dislocations,  which  extend  throughout  the  thickness  of 

epitaxial GaN films. It appears that the high density of dislocations in sputtered Si-doped GaN 

films which originate during the initial stages of growth, lead to the formation of low and high 

angle grain boundaries, manifesting in the significant twist and tilt of mosaic blocks. It is thus 

inferred  that  the  tensile  stress  seen  in  most  of  the  sputtered  Si-doped  GaN  films  originates 

during crystallite coalescence, as was also suggested by Romano et al. [29] for MOCVD grown 

films. Although, the incorporation of Si on the compressive side of edge dislocations has also 

10 

 
been suggested to cause tensile in-plane stress [38], this effect appears to be marginal in the 

present case, owing to the similarity of the strain behaviour of Si-doped GaN films with that of 

undoped GaN films, which was reported earlier [18]. 

Interesting features are however seen in the behaviour of intrinsic biaxial stress at the 

higher and lower ends of N2 percentage. Firstly, in the film grown at 100% N2, the intrinsic 

stress  is  compressive  with  a  substantially  large  value  (-1.6  GPa),  but  reverses  to  tensile 

character in the films grown below 75% N2. Secondly, at the lower end of N2 percentage, the 

tensile intrinsic stress, tends to decrease substantially. Polycrystalline metal films deposited by 

sputtering are known to display a reversal of in-plane stress from tensile to compressive stress 

at low sputtering pressure [43, 44, 61, 62] and high negative substrate bias [61, 63], which has 

been ascribed to the incorporation of inert atoms [43, 44] and oxygen [64].  In the present work, 

all the Si-doped GaN films were grown at a fixed sputtering pressure, but as mentioned above, 

the N/Ga ratio is substantially larger in the films grown at higher N2 percentages, while the Si 

and O contents of the films remain practically unchanged. It is thus likely that the source of the 

compressive  intrinsic  stress  in  the  films  grown  at  high  N2  percentages  is  the  same  as  that 

invoked  for  explaining  the  large  hydrostatic  strain.  It  is  thus  inferred  that  incorporation  of 

excess nitrogen into grain boundaries is the source of compressive stress in the films grown at 

high N2 percentages [39, 65], while another possible cause could be the attraction of nitrogen 

interstitials towards tensile side of edge dislocations [66]. Thus, the large compressive stress in 

Si-doped GaN films grown at higher N2 percentages (~100%), is primarily attributed to the 

presence of excess/interstitial nitrogen, which is in tune with our earlier studies on undoped 

GaN films [18]. With the decrease in N/Ga ratio in the films grown at 30% - 50% N2, the effects 

due to excess nitrogen are suppressed, resulting in the reversal of intrinsic stress, which is now 

determined  primarily  by  the coalescence  related  intrinsic  tensile stress.  Finally,  in  the films 

grown  below  30%  N2,  a  reduction  of  tensile  stress  is  seen,  which  may  be  explained  as  the 

relaxation of coalescence related tensile stress by the incorporation of Ar in the films, which, 

as mentioned above, cannot be ruled out during the growth at high Ar percentages [44]. Thus, 

the  incorporation  of  Ar  in  the  films  grown  at  low  N2  percentages  consistently  explains  the 

increase in hydrostatic strain and micro-strain, together with the decrease of intrinsic tensile 

stress. It may also be mentioned that these films have a substantially voided morphology and 

large surface roughness, which may also possibly contribute to the reduction of intrinsic tensile 

stress, as observed in zone 1 type sputtered metal films [67, 68].

4. Conclusion 

Hetero-epitaxial  Si-doped  GaN  films  have  been  grown  on  sapphire  by  reactive  co-

sputtering of GaAs and Si in Ar-N2 growth atmosphere. The residual stress in the films grown 

at different N2 percentages in the range of 10% - 100% have been analyzed and correlated with 

microstructural parameters. EDX results show that all the films contain ~2 at.% Si and ~3 at.% 

oxygen impurity, while the N/Ga ratio decreases with reduction of N2 percentage in growth 

atmosphere.  The  in-plane  and  out-of-plane  strain  components  obtained  from  independent 

measurements of a and c parameters are strongly dependent on N2 percentage and reveal the 

concurrent presence of hydrostatic and biaxial strain contributions. The films grown at 30%-

100% N2 show the dominant presence of edge dislocations (density ~1012 cm-2), which decrease 

to ~5 × 1011 cm-2 in the films grown at ~10% N2. However, below 30% N2, the density of screw 

dislocations  increases  and  approaches  values comparable  to  those of edge dislocations. The 

film grown at 100% N2 also displays large micro-strain (~1.5 × 10-2) and hydrostatic strain 

(~2.5 × 10-3) due to the incorporation of nitrogen at interstitial locations,  as well as growth-

related compressive biaxial stress (-1.6 GPa), which is attributed to nitrogen incorporation into 

the  grain  boundaries  and  possibly  tensile  side  of  edge  dislocations.  The  micro-strain  and 

hydrostatic strain  decrease substantially with  the decrease of N/Ga ratio  in  the films grown 

below 75% N2, due the decrease of excess nitrogen, resulting in the prevalence of the intrinsic 

tensile stress, which is generated during coalescence. In the case of the films grown below 30% 

N2, the slight increase of micro-strain and hydrostatic strain as well as the reduction of intrinsic 

tensile stress are attributed to the incorporation of Ar, with the latter being also influenced by 

possibly the voided morphology of films. An interesting observation from the present work on 

sputtered Si-doped GaN films is that the high doping concentration of Si does not appear to 

have  any  hydrostatic  influence  on  the  strain  behaviour,  which  is  in  tune  with  theoretical 

predictions, as well as most of the earlier reported measurements on MOCVD grown films. 

Our results however show that in any case, the effect of Si incorporation is likely to be masked 

by growth-related stresses due to incorporation of nitrogen and/or argon in the films, and more 

importantly, by the intrinsic tensile stress generated during coalescence, which is dominant in 

most of the films.

1. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy 

Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was carried out to study the composition 

of Si-doped GaN films, and in particular, evaluate their Si content and confirm the absence of 

arsenic. The results are shown in Fig. S1 and the data obtained from EDX analysis are presented 

in Table S1, which show that all the films contain ~2 at.% Si. It is found that the Si content of 

the films remains  in the range of 2-3 at.%, irrespective of the increase of Si  area coverage, 

which results in deterioration of the structural quality of films.

(as indicated), which also include the data for a commercially procured, MOCVD grown undoped GaN film.

2. Phi (ϕ) scans 

The phi (ϕ) scans of (101̅1) reflections for Si doped GaN films grown at different N2 

percentages,  along  with  the  ϕ-scan  of  (101̅4)  reflections  of  sapphire  are  shown  in  Fig.  S2, 

which show six dominant peaks at intervals of 60º with each other, corresponding to (101̅1) 

reflections. The ϕ-scan of (101̅4) reflections of sapphire are rotated by 30°, which imply the 

in-plane epitaxial relationship of GaN[112̅0]║α-Al2O3[101̅0].

3. In-plane x-ray diffraction 

The in-plane measurements of (112̅0) and (202̅0) reflections were used to obtain the      

a-parameter of Si-doped GaN films grown at different N2 percentages in sputtering atmosphere. 

These results are shown in Fig. S3.

sapphire at different N2 percentages in growth atmosphere (as indicated). 

4. Lattice parameters 

The ω-2  high resolution scans of symmetric and asymmetric reflections as well as in-

plane  measurements  were  carried  out  to  independently  obtain  the  c  and  a  parameters  of 

epitaxial Si-doped GaN films grown at different N2 percentages. The average values of c and 

a parameters along with the error bars are plotted in Fig. S4 against Ar and N2 percentages in 

growth. The film grown at 100% N2 shows a significantly larger c-parameter (5.211 ± 0.01) Å 

and  a  marginally  smaller  a-parameter  (3.182  ±  0.0002)  Å,  compared  to  the  corresponding 

standard values for bulk GaN (c = 5.185 Å, a = 3.189 Å). With decrease of N2 percentage in 

growth atmosphere, the c-parameter decreases monotonically and becomes (5.181 ± 0.001) Å 

for the film grown at 30% N2, which is slightly smaller than the standard value. However, with 

further decrease of N2 percentage, the c-parameter increases again, becoming slightly larger 

than the standard value. On the other hand, the a-parameter increases initially with decrease of 

N2 percentage and becomes substantially larger than the standard value for the film grown at

substantially, displaying values comparable to the standard value.

respectively. 

5. Surface morphology 

The surface morphology of Si-doped GaN films grown at different N2 percentage was 

investigated by AFM in contact mode and the results are shown in Fig. S5 for typical cases, 

along with corresponding root mean square (rms) surface roughness data plotted against Ar/ 

N2 percentages in sputtering atmosphere.
