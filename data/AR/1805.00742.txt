One-dimensional  particle-in-cell  simulation  is  used  to  simulate  the  capacitively  coupled 

argon  plasma  for  a  range  of  driving  frequency  from  13.56  MHz  to  100  MHz.  The  argon 

chemistry  set  can,  selectively,  include  two  metastable  levels  enabling  multi-step  ionization 

and metastable pooling. The results show that the plasma density decreases when metastable 

atoms are included with higher discrepancy at higher excitation frequency. The contribution 

of  multistep  ionization  to  overall  density  increases  with  excitation  frequency.   The  electron 

temperature  increases  with  the  inclusion  of  metastable  atoms  and  decreases  with  excitation 
frequency. At lower excitation frequency, the density of Ar** (3p5 4p, 13.1 eV) is higher than 
Ar* (3p5 4s, 11.6 eV), whereas, at higher excitation frequencies the Ar* (3p5 4s, 11.6 eV) is 

the dominant metastable atom. The metastable and electron temperature profile evolve from a 

parabolic  profile  at  lower  excitation  frequency  to  a  saddle  type  profile  at  higher  excitation 

frequency.  With  metastable,  the  electron  energy  distribution  function  (EEDF)  changes  its 

shape  from  Druyvesteyn  type,  at  low  excitation  frequency,  to  bi-Maxwellian,  at  high 

frequency  plasma  excitation,  however  a  three-temperature  EEDF  is  observed  without 

metastable atoms. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

Capacitively  coupled  plasma  (CCP)  discharge  driven  at  13.56  MHz  remains  industrial 

standard tool for plasma processing applications including thin film depositions and reactive 
ion etching (RIE)1. A recent trend towards increase in the processing rates of CCP discharges

is utilizing plasma excitation in very high frequency (VHF) range, i.e. from 30 – 300 MHz. 

Further  benefits  of  VHF  CCP  discharges  are  low  temperature  processing,  lower  substrate 
damage and unique gas-phase chemistry2-7. Most recent example is the deposition of thin film 

of silicon nitride (Si3N4) on lithesome substrate for flexible organic electronic devices, where 

using 162 MHz plasma excitation a thin film of high optical transmittance and low WVTR is 
deposited at a substrate temperature of 1000 C8-9. In etching of S-MAP and organic low-k film 

having  an  inorganic  film  etch  mask,  the  100  MHz radio-frequency  (rf)  RIE  plasma  process 

have shown great improvement of the carbon film etch profile, high selectivity, less erosion 

of  the  SiO2  mask  edge,  and  straight  sidewall  profile  in  comparison  to  13.56  MHz  plasma 
excitation10.  

Besides  process  improvements,  the  VHF  plasma  excitation  showed  significant 

difference  in  the  discharge  characteristics  including  electron  heating  mechanism  when 

compared to 13.56 MHz CCP. For instance, the VHF excited CCP discharges produce high 
plasma density and low self-bias11. This is due to increase in the discharge current and plasma 

density  at  VHF  plasma  excitation  for  a  constant  discharge  power.  The  VHF  plasma 

excitations  also  exhibit  a  bi-Maxwellian  type  electron  energy  distribution  function  (EEDF), 
irrespective of gas pressure or gas type12-15. The transformation of EEDF to bi-Maxwellian at 
VHF was also predicted by particle-in-cell simulation16. The electron heating mechanism is 
mostly stochastic at a low gas pressure in 13.56 MHz CCP17, whereas, it is observed that the 

CCP discharges driven at VHF are mostly produced and sustained by “beam like electrons” 
which  are  produced  from  near  to  the  edge  of  expanding  sheath16,  18-19.    Furthermore,  it  is 

experimentally observed that the higher excitation frequency, 100 MHz in comparison to 60 
MHz,  yield  higher  densities  of  negative  ion  species  at  a  constant  rf  power20.  The 

enhancement  in  the  negative  ion  densities  with  excitation  frequency  is  further  suited  for 

etching  of  future  generation  micro-devices  with  a  sub-nm  characteristic  size  when  using  a 
pulsed plasma system21. 

Apart from neutrals and charged species, there exist long-lived metastable atoms and 

molecules in the discharge. These metastable are produced through various mechanisms but 

the  important  one  is  electron  impact  excitation  of  ground  state.  The  presence  of  metastable 

causes  obvious  electron  energy  dissipation  and  affects  the  discharge  characteristics 

significantly. However, the metastable existence could enhance plasma density through multi-

step ionization and metastable pooling. In gas mixtures, the metastable collisions with other 

species  further  drive  many  other  chemical  transformations.  In  the  past  decades,  many 

simulation,  theoretical  and  experimental  studies  have  been  performed  to  investigate  the

influence  of  metastable  on  discharge  characteristic  in  low  to  high  pressure  CCP  discharge 
excited  at  13.56  MHz22-35.  However,  there  exist  very  few  studies  describing  the  effect  of 
excitation frequency. Colgan et al6 performed fluid simulation and experiment in capacitively 

coupled argon discharge in the frequency range of 13.56 MHz to 54.4 MHz and at a fixed gas 

pressure of 250 mTorr. This study was emphasized on the scaling law at a constant discharge 
voltage and discharge current. Hebner et al35 measured optical emission and argon metastable 

density  along  with  line-integrated  electron  density  and  ion  saturation  current  in  a  dual-

frequency,  capacitively  coupled,  300  mm-wafer  plasma  processing  system  excited  in  the 

frequency  range  from  10  MHz  to  190  MHz.  They  discovered  that  the  argon  metastable 
density and spatial distribution were not a strong function of drive frequency. Zhang et al36 

used  fluid  simulation  to  simulate  the  capacitively  coupled  argon  plasma  including  the 

metastable in the frequency range from 0.5 to 30 MHz at a gas pressure of 300 mTorr and 1 

Torr.  For  both  pressure  conditions,  and  for  all  the  excitation  frequencies,  they  observed  a 

saddle distribution of metastable profile in the axial direction.   

The aim of this study to systematically investigate the influence of metastable atoms 

on  the  discharge  properties  including  EEDF  versus  excitation  frequency,  13.56  MHz  –  100 

MHz,  in  CCP  discharges.  We  employed  one-dimensional,  particle-in-cell  (PIC)  code  with 

Monte Carlo Collisions (MCCs). Although computationally expensive, the PIC, unlike fluid 

simulation, makes no implicit assumptions on the electron velocity distribution function and 

therefore provides useful insight of the plasma kinetics. The study is performed in a CCP with 

a discharge gap of 3.2 cm. The applied voltage and gas pressure is kept constant at 100 V and 

100 mTorr respectively. We further examined the effect of excitation frequency on the axial 

distribution of metastable densities and EEDF.  

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE PIC SIMULATION 

The  simulation  procedure,  which  is  used  in  present  research  work  is  based  on  Particle-  in-
Cell/Monte  Carlo  collision  (PIC/MCC)  methods37-38.    The  main  advantage  of  employing  a 

PIC code is that there are no assumptions to the calculation of electron velocity distribution 

function  (EEDF)  implicitly,  although  the  price  to  be  paid  is  that  a  PIC  code  is 

computationally  very  expensive.  We  have  used  well-tested  1D3V,  self-  consistent, 

electrostatic,  PIC  code  developed  at  Dublin  City  University,  Ireland  in  the  current  research 
work39.  This  code  was  recently  used  to  validate  the  analytical  models  predicting  stochastic 

heating, field reversal and ion reflection from the sheath region, and electric field transients in

The simulation region, 3.2 cm electrode separation, is divided into 512 number of grids and 

number of particles per cell is 100 for all cases. The time step has been chosen of the order of 
-11  s.  The  electrodes  are  planar  and  parallel  to  each  other  with  infinite  dimension  and 
secondary electron emission is also ignored. The electrodes are perfectly absorbing for both 

10

electrons  and  ions.  One  of  the  electrodes  is  grounded  while  an  RF  voltage  having  the 

following wave- form drives the other one:

The  metastable  or  neutral  excited  states  evolve  on  much  slower  time  scales  compared  to 

electrons because the argon to electron mass ratio is greater than ~70,000, and therefore the 
simulation  is  run  for  ~5200  RF  cycles  to  achieve  the  steady  states  for  all  cases28. We  have

considered three cases here: (1) Without metastable case, which includes equations 1, 4, 11, 

12 and 15 from table 1 (2) With metastable including multistep ionization, which includes all 

set of equations in table 1. (3) With metastable no multistep ionization, which includes all set 

of equations except equation 9 and 10 in table 1.  

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

Fig. 1 shows the plasma density and electron temperature versus excitation frequency at the 

centre of the discharge for without metastable, with metastable-multistep ionization and with 

metastable-no  multistep  ionization.  These  parameters  are  deduced  from  the  EEDF  using,

,  where  F(ε)  is 

EEDF and ε is the electron energy. As displayed in Fig. 1 (a), the plasma density increases 

with  excitation  frequency  for  all  cases.  However,  there  exist  substantial  difference  in  the 

absolute densities. At all excitation frequencies, the without-metastable case is producing the 

highest plasma density, whereas, with metastable-no multistep ionization the plasma density 

is the lowest. Including multistep ionization is boosting the plasma density when compared to 

no-multistep ionization but it is still lower than without metastable. Unlike plasma density, a 

reverse  trend  is  observed  for  the  electron  temperature.  As  shown  in  Fig.  1  (b),  the  electron 

temperature  decreases  with  increasing  excitation  frequency  for  with-metastable,  whereas,  it 

increases  with  frequency  when  the  metastable  are  not  considered  in  the  simulation.  The 

electron temperature is consistently lower for without metastable while it is highest for with 

metastable-no  multistep  ionization.  Including  multistep  ionization,  the  electron  temperature 

decreases slightly when compared to no multistep ionization, but its trend versus excitation 
frequency is same. These results are in contradict with previous fluid simulations6,  36 which 

predict either constant or an increase in the electron temperature, however, our results are in 
good agreement with the experiment12.

FIG. 1. (a) The plasma density and (b) electron temperature versus excitation frequency at the 

centre of the discharge for without metastable, with metastable-multistep ionization and with 

metastable-no multistep ionization.  

An increase in the plasma density with excitation frequency is mainly attributed to increase in 

the  discharge  current.  At  constant  discharge  voltage,  increase  in  the  excitation  frequency 

reduces sheath impedance which allows more current to flow through plasma, increasing the 

rf  power  into  the  plasma,  and  therefore  plasma  density  increases.  Without  metastable  case, 
we observed an increase in peak discharge current from 13 A/m2 at 13.56 MHz to 360 A/m2 

at 100 MHz. Similarly with metastable – multistep ionization and no multistep ionization, the 
discharge current increases from 10 A/m2 at 13.56 MHz to 300 A/m2 and 280 A/m2 at 100 

MHz respectively. The increasing trend of plasma density versus excitation frequency is also 

in  accordance  with,  𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑚𝑎  𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦   ∝    𝜔!"

!   as  predicted  for  a  constant  voltage  case1.  A 

decrease  in  the  plasma  density  with  the  inclusion  of  the  metastable  atoms  is  attributed  to 

power  losses  in  the  several  reactions  including  production  and  losses  of  metastable  atoms, 

table 1. Furthermore at constant pressure, the production of metastable decreases the ground 

state  atom  density.  Both  of  these  decreases  the  direct  electron  impact  ionization  rates  from 

the  ground  state  and  therefore  the  plasma  density  decreases.  The  inclusion  of  multistep 

ionization  increases  the  ion-electron  production  channel  which  in  turn  increases  the  plasma 

density,  however,  it  is  still  lower  than  without  metastable  case.    It  is  noteworthy  that  the 

difference between plasma density for with metastable - multistep ionization and no multistep 

ionization  increases  with  excitation  frequency.  At  13.56  MHz  the  percentage  difference  in 

plasma density is ~10 % which is increasing up to ~20 % at 100 MHz excitation frequency. 

These results show that the contribution of multistep ionization to plasma density is higher at 

higher excitation frequency.  With  metastable,  an  observed  decreasing  trend  of  electron 

Page	  6	  of	  14	  

	  	  
	  
 
 
temperature  versus  excitation  frequency,  Fig  1  (b),  is  attributed  to  an  increase  in  the 

population  of  low  energy  electrons.  This  is  mainly  due  to  enhanced  ionization  at  higher 

excitation frequency which produces low energy electrons. Figure 2 shows the EEDF at the 

centre of the discharge for different excitation frequencies from 13.56 – 100 MHz. As shown 

in Fig 2 (a), the low electron energy population increases with excitation frequency. The high 

energy  population  also  increases,  however,  it  increases  at  a  lower  rate  than  low  energy 

electron  population.  Furthermore,  a  peak  in  the  EEDF  is  observed  to  shift  towards  low 

energy.  Due  to  change  in  the  population  of  low  and  high  energy  electron  population  at  a 

different rate transforming the shape of EEDF from Druyvesteyn to bi-Maxwellian which is 
described previously16. The transformation of EEDF from Druyvesteyn at low frequency to 

bi-Maxwellian  at  very  high  frequency  was  also  predicted  and  in  agreement  with  the 
experiments12-15.  Without  metastable,  the  density  of  both  low  energy  electrons  and  tail 

electrons  increases,  albeit,  nearly  at  the  same  rate  (Fig  2  (b)),  and  therefore  the  electron 

temperature also increases.

FIG. 3. EEDF at the centre of the discharge for without metastable, with metastable-

multistep, with metastable-no multistep. (a) 13.56 MHz and (b) 100 MHz. 

Figure 3 (a) and 3(b) plot the EEDF for each of the three cases, at excitation of 13.56 MHz 

and  100  MHz,  respectively.  As  shown  in  Fig.  3  (a),  when  metastable  are  included  the  low 

energy  electron  population  decreases  and  a  depletion  of  the  high-energy  tail  is  observed. 

Similar results are obtained at 100 MHz excitation, Fig. 3 (b). A decrease in the population of 

low energy electrons and depletion of high-energy electrons in with-metastable case is mainly 

attributed to energy losses in the inelastic collisions. These processes significantly affect the 

ionization  rate  and  therefore  plasma  density  also  decreases.  It  is  interesting  that  the 

population  of  mid  energy  electrons,  i.e.  from  ~  4-13  eV,  is  higher  in  the  case  of  with 

metastable  when  compared  to  without  metastable.  One  of  the  reasons  for  observing  higher 

population of these mid energy range electrons is the production of metastable atoms. When 

metastable are included, they are mostly formed by electron impact excitation of the ground 

state. In the case of Ar, the maximum collision cross sections of such reactions are observed 
at  an  electron  energy  of  20-30  eV43,  and  therefore  large  number  of  mid  energy  range 

electrons are produced during metastable production process. An increase in the population 

of  these  mid  energy  electrons  justifies  higher  electron  temperature  as  observed  in  with 

metastable  cases.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2  (b),  the  fraction  of  mid  energy  range  electron  is 

decreasing  at  100  MHz  and  therefore  the  difference  between  electron  temperature  for  with 

and without metastable decreases with excitation frequency.

FIG. 4. The argon metastable densities versus excitation frequency at the centre of the 

discharge for with metastable-multistep ionization and with metastable-no multistep 

ionization. 

Fig.  4  plots  the  densities  of  Ar*  and  Ar**  at  the  centre  of  the  discharge  as  a  function  of 

excitation frequency. The densities are shown for both with and without multistep ionization.  
As shown in the figure the densities of Ar* and Ar** increases with excitation frequency. For 
multistep ionization, it is observed that the density of Ar* increases from ~5x1016 m-3 at 13.56 
MHz to ~2.2x1017 m-3 at 100 MHz, whereas, the density of Ar** increase from 9x1016 m-3 at 
13.56 MHz to 1.4x1017 m-3 at 100 MHz. This observed increase in Ar* and Ar** densities is 

again due to increase in the discharge current with increase in the excitation frequency, which 

increases the discharge power. As expected, for without multistep ionization, the densities of 
Ar*  and  Ar**  are  consistently  higher  in  comparison  to  with  multistep  ionization.  It  is 
important  to  note  that  there  is  a  crossover  in  the  densities  of  Ar*  and  Ar**  with  excitation 
frequency. At 13.56 MHz, Ar** is the dominant metastable atom, whereas, at 100 MHz the 
density  of  Ar*  is  higher  in  comparison  to  Ar**.  One  of  the  possible  reasons  for  this 

discrepancy is an overall decrease in the electron temperature with excitation frequency. The 
excitation energy of Ar* and Ar** are 11.6 eV and 13.1 eV respectively and therefore it very 
likely  to  produce  low  excitation  energy  Ar*  metastable  at  100  MHz  due  to  lower  electron 

temperature.  The  observed  trend  of  metastable  densities  versus  excitation  frequency  at  the

centre of the discharge may not be same at different locations in the discharge, and therefore 

we further examined the profile of metastable atom densities between the electrodes.

respectively. 

Fig.  5  shows  the  profile  of  Ar*  and  Ar**  densities  between  the  electrodes  for  different 

excitation  frequencies.  We  observed  that  the  metastable  densities  increase  with  excitation 

frequency  at  all  locations  between  the  electrodes.  Without  multistep  ionization,  the 
metastable densities are always higher. The Ar** density is higher than Ar* density at lower 
excitation frequency, whereas, at higher excitation frequency Ar* is the dominant metastable 

atom. It is interesting that the metastable profile changing its shape from parabolic, at 13.56 

MHz, to a saddle type distribution at higher excitation frequencies. The transformation of the 

metastable profile from parabolic to saddle type is also observed in the case without multistep 

ionization. This confirm that the dip in the metastable densities in the bulk plasma at higher 

excitation  frequency  is  not  due  to  step-wise  ionization  but  it  is  directly  related  to  the 

excitation  frequency  which  produces  higher  densities  of  metastable  atoms.  The  saddle 

profiles  were  also  observed  by  previous  authors  at  13.56  MHz  excitation  frequency  and  at 
higher  gas  pressures26-28.  They  attributed  this  effect  to  reduction  in  the  mean  free  path  of 

electrons at higher gas pressures resulted to enhanced excitation to metastable states near to 

the sheath edge. Since the production of metastable atoms is directly related with the electron 

temperature,  therefore,  we  further  examined  the  electron  temperature  profile  to  understand 

the  observed  saddle  type  profile  at  higher  excitation.  Fig.  6  shows  the  electron  temperature 

profile  for  different  excitation  frequencies  and  with  multistep  ionization.  As  shown  in  the

figure,  a  similar  type  of  transition  is  observed  in  the  electron  temperature  profile.  At  13.56 

MHz,  the  electron  temperature  is  maximum  at  the  centre  of  the  discharge  and  decreasing 

towards  the  electrodes.  At  higher  excitation  frequency,  off-centred  peak  in  the  electron 

temperature profile is observed. The variation of electron temperature between the electrodes 

represents  a  variation  in  the  mean  electron  energy  which  is  localized  near  to  the  sheath  at 

higher excitation frequency. The source term of metastable states is a function of gas density, 

electron density and excitation rate coefficients which is a function of electron temperature. 

At constant gas pressure the neutral gas density is constant. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 6 

(b), the electron density profile is also parabolic at higher excitation frequency, and therefore 

the  observed  saddle  profile  of  metastable  densities  is  mainly  attributed  to  non-uniform 

electron temperature profile.

IV. Summary and conclusions 

We have performed one-dimensional, self-consistent, particle-in-cell simulation to investigate 

the  effect  of  excitation  frequency  on  the  metastable  atoms  and  electron  energy  distribution 

function in a low pressure capacitively coupled Ar plasma. The excitation frequency is varied 

from 13.56 MHz to 100 MHz, and the simulation is performed for 3 cases namely; without 

metastable, with metastable-no multistep ionization and with metastable-multistep ionization 

for a constant discharge voltage and at a fixed gas pressure of 100 mTorr.   

It  is  shown  that  the  plasma  density  decreases  when  metastable  atoms  are  included. 

The  difference  is  higher  at  higher  excitation  frequency.  Including  multistep  ionization 

increases the plasma density when compared to without multistep ionization, however, it is 

still  lower  than  without  metastable  case.  These  results  suggest  that  the  multistep  ionization 

and metastable pooling doesn’t play significant role in overall plasma density in comparison

to ground state ionization. Meanwhile, the electron temperature is showing the reverse trend 

i.e. it is lower in the case of without metastable and higher in the case of with metastable-no 

multi step ionization. The EEDF comparison for 3 different cases shows that this discrepancy 

is due to the higher population of mid energy range electrons, 4-13 eV, which is possible due 

to the production of metastable atoms. Moreover, a change in the shape of EEDF is observed 

from  Druyvesteyn  type  at  lower  excitation  frequency  to  bi-Maxwellian  at  higher  exciation 
frequency.  An  increase  in  the  densities  of  both  Ar*  and  Ar**  is  observed  versus  excitation 
frequency. At lower excitation frequency, the density of Ar** is higher than Ar*, whereas, at 
higher excitation frequency Ar* is the dominant metastable atom. Additionally, the profile of 

metastable atoms is changing from parabolic shape at lower excitation frequency to a saddle 

type distribution at higher excitation frequency. This transformation is due to the change in 

the  profile  of  electron  temperature  which  is  also  showing  off-centred  peak  at  higher 

excitation frequency. The off-centred peak in the electron temperature profile is suggesting a 

heating mode transition which is subject of future publication.
