We report on the synthesis and characterization of nanocrystalline d -MoN by crystallization 

of  amorphous  thin  films  grown  on  (100)  Si  by  reactive  sputtering  at  room  temperature. 

Films with chemical composition MoN were grown using a deposition pressure of 5mTorr 

with a reactive mixture of Ar/(Ar+N2)=0.5. The as-grown films display mostly amorphous 
structure. Nanocrystalline  d -MoN phase is obtained after  annealing  at temperatures above 

600 °C. The superconducting critical temperature Tc depends on film thickness. Thick films 

(170 nm) annealed at 700 °C for 30 min display a Tc = 11.2 K (close to the one reported for 
bulk  specimens:  13  K),  which  is  gradually  suppressed    to  7.2  K  for  40  nm  thick  d -MoN 

films. Our results provide a simple method to synthesize superconducting nitride thin films 

on silicon wafers with Tc above the ones observed for conventional superconductors such as 

Nb.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 

2 

The  synthesis  of  superconducting  transition-metal  nitrides  is  of  technological  relevance 

in  the  design  of  devices  such  as  tunnel  junctions  [1]  and  electromagnetic  radiation 

detectors  [2,3].  The  molybdenum  nitrides  present  several  superconducting  crystalline 
phases:  g -Mo2N  (cubic)  with  Tc  ~  5  K  [4],  b -Mo2N  (tetragonal)  with  superconducting 
critical temperature Tc ~ 5 K [5] and d -MoN (hexagonal) with Tc ~ 13 K [6,7]. Thin films of 

the different crystalline structures have been sintered through chemical and physical routes 
d -MoN  is  that  sharp 

[8,9,10,11,12,13].  An  outstanding  feature  for 

g -Mo2N  and 

superconducting transitions have been observed for epitaxial and polycrystalline thin films 

[14,15,16]. Moreover, superconductivity has been observed for films with thicknesses of a 

few nanometers [14,15,17]. Recently, we have reported that the chemical concentration and 

Tc for Mo-N thin films grown at room temperature by reactive sputtering can be modified 

by  changing  the  Ar:N2  ratio  [18].  Films  grown  with  N2/(Ar+N2)  <  0.4  mixtures  are 
superconducting  with  nanocrystalline  g -Mo2N  phase.  Films  grown  with  N2/(Ar+N2)  >  0.4 
mixtures  are  mostly  amorphous  with  a  stoichiometry  Mo/N  »

  1  (close  to  the  one 

corresponding  to  d -MoN).  These  amorphous  films  do  not  display  superconducting 
transition.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  d -MoN  phase  displays  Tc  higher  than  Nb  (hence, 
displays larger superconducting gap D

 = 1.76*kB*Tc). In addition, hexagonal δ–MoN is the 

hardest superconductor metal nitride (relevant for coating) [7].  

In  this  work,  we  report  the  synthesis  of  nanocrystalline  δ-MoN  by  crystallization  of 

amorphous  thin  films.  Initially,  stoichiometric  MoN  thin  films  are  grown  by  reactive  DC 

sputtering  at  room  temperature  on  AlN  buffered  (100)  Si  substrates  using  a  N2/(Ar+N2)= 
0.5  mixture.  As-grown  thin  films  display  a  residual-resistivity  ratio  RRR  =  R300K/Ronset  »

0.8. Nanocrystalline d -MoN phase with RRR > 1 is obtained after annealing at temperatures 

above  600  °C.  The  annealed  films  display  very  smooth  surfaces.  The  superconducting 

critical temperature Tc is strongly affected by the film thickness. The successful synthesis 

of  δ-MoN  thin  films  on  Si  substrates  by  a  controllable  and  reproducible  route  (with  low 

roughness values), enhances the potential applications in superconducting devices. 

 
 
 
2. Material and methods

MoN films were deposited on 8 nm thick AlN buffered Si (100) substrates by reactive DC 

magnetron sputtering using  a N2/(Ar+N2)= 0.5 mixture without any intentional heating of 

the substrate [17,18]. The AlN buffer layer was introduced to avoid any chemical reaction 

between  the  Mo  and  the  SiO2  cup  layer  of  the  Si  wafers.  AlN  was  selected  because  it 

displays  high  stability  at  interfaces  with  transition  metal  nitrides  [1].  However,  no 

appreciable  differences  in  Tc  were  observed  for  thin  films  grown  with  and  without  the 
buffer  layer  (not  shown).  The  residual  pressure  of  the  chamber  was  less  than  10−6  Torr. 

Ultra-high purity Ar (99.999%) and N2 (99.999%) were used as gas sources. The AlN and 

MoN  layers  were  grown  by  RF  (100  W)  and  DC  (50  W)  magnetron  sputtering, 

respectively.  During  deposition  the  target  to  substrate  distance  was  ~  5.5  cm.  The  total 

pressure at the chamber was 5 mTorr. AlN buffer layers were grown using a N2/(Ar+N2)= 
0.2 mixture [17]. The deposition rate for MoN using a N2/(Ar+N2)= 0.5 mixture was »

 17 

nm  /  min.  Thermal  annealing  was  performed  in  vacuum  (to  avoid  surface  contamination) 
with  a  residual  pressure  of  10-5  Torr  at  temperatures  between  400  °C  and  700  °C  during 

periods of 30 min. In order to homogenize the temperature, the films were enveloped in a 

tantalum  foil  during  the  annealing  procedure.  Wherever  used,  the  notation  [d-T] 

corresponds  to  samples  with  thickness  d  annealed  at  T  °C  (with  T  =  400  °C,  600  °C  and 

700°C) for 30 min. The results shown here correspond to 40 nm, 60 nm, 100 nm and 170 

nm  thick  MoN  films.  However,  most  studies  are  performed  in  170  nm  thick  MoN  films, 

which display the highest Tc.  

X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  patterns  were  obtained  with  a  Panalytical  Empirean  equipment. 

The  structure  was  studied  by  transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM)  with  a  Philips 

CM200UT microscope operating at 200 kV. The TEM specimen was prepared by scraping 

the  surface  of  a  film  with  a  diamond  tip.  The  topology  of  the  films  was  characterized  by 
atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements in a Dimension 3100Brucker microscope. 

The AFM images were obtained in tapping mode. The chemical composition and thickness 

of  the  films  were  analyzed  by  Rutherford  Backscattering  Spectroscopy  (RBS)  with  a 

 
 
4 

TANDEM  accelerator  using  a  2  MeV  4He2+  ion  beam.  Surface  composition  analysis  was 

performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a standard Al/Mg twin-anode 

X-ray  gun  and  a  hemispherical  electrostatic  electron  energy  analyzer  (high  vacuum 
conditions  with  a  base  pressure  of  10-9  Torr).  The  electrical  transport  measurements  were 

performed using the standard four-point configuration. Magnetization measurements  were 

performed  in  a  SQUID  magnetometer.  Critical  current  densities  (Jc)  were  estimated 

considering the Bean model [19]. 

3. Results and discussion 

The  chemical  composition  of  the  films  was  verified  using  RBS.  The  composition 

MoN(1.00±0.05) was observed for pristine and annealed specimens. As-grown MoN thin films 
using  a  N2/(Ar+N2)=  0.5  mixture  are  mostly  amorphous  (a  little  reflection  attributed  to  g  

Mo2N  is  observed)  [18].  The  crystallization  of  δ-MoN  after  thermal  annealing  at 

temperatures  above  600  °C  was  confirmed  by  XRD  (see  Fig.  1).  The  lattice  parameters 

calculated from the (002) and (200) diffraction peaks, are a = 0.572(2) nm and c = 0.555(3) 

nm. These values are close to those observed in epitaxial δ-MoN [12]. Figures 2abc show 

TEM  images  for  [170-700].  Fig.  2a  shows  a  cross  section  bright  field  TEM  image  where 

the  film  thickness  homogeneity  can  be  observed.  Figure  2b  shows  a  dark  field  image 

obtained  from  the  (200)d -MoN  ring  (see  selected  area  electron  diffraction  (SAED)  in  the 

inset). The bright regions in the image correspond to nanometric δ-MoN grains with typical 

size between 5 nm and 10 nm. In addition, the 201 reflection -corresponding to a superficial 

MoO3 layer- is observed in the SAED [17]. Figure 2c shows a high resolution TEM image 

of  δ-MoN  grains.  The  spots  corresponding  to  the  200  reflections  are  identified  for  one  of 
the  grains.  In  addition,  planes  at  distances  of  »

  0.248  nm  can  be  identified  from  Fourier 

filtered  image.  Figure  3a  shows  the  AFM  image  for  [170-700]  (smother  surfaces  are 

observed  for  thinner  films).  The  film  displays  a  very  smooth  surface,  only  a  few  small 

morphologic inhomogeneities with a height less than 6 nm are observed (see profile in Fig. 
3b).  The  Root  Mean  Square  (RMS)  roughness  for  an  area  of  5  m m2  is  0.6  nm,  which 

 
 
 
5 

indicates  that  (compared  to  as-grown  films)  crystallization  does  not  significantly  alter  the 

morphology of the films [17]. The weak influence of the annealing in the surface topology 

can be attributed to the crystallization of grains with diameter of a few nanometers.  

XPS measurements were performed to obtain information about the chemical composition 

of the film and the chemical state of the Mo. The photoelectron peaks Mo3d, O1s, C1s and 

N1s were measured in detail. An overlap of the N1s and the Mo3p peaks was observed. In 

order to remove components related to superficial C and MoO3, the surface of the films was 
cleaned with Ar+ sputtering (2kV) [17]. The Mo3d binding energy region for the surface of 

as-grown  films  and  [170-700]  thin  films  is  shown  in  Figs.  4a  and  4b,  respectively.  The 

thickness  of  the  MoO3  surface  layer  was  estimated  in  1.6  nm  using  the  XPS  Mo3d 

intensities  of  the  MoO3  and  MoN  phase  [20].  In  the  as-grown  Mo3d  spectra  two 

components were identified: a major component at BE= 228.9eV attributed to the δ-MoN 
phase, and a minor component at BE=228.5eV attributed to the g -Mo2N phase [21,22]. In 

the [170-700] films only one major  component  was identified  at BE=228.9eV, which  can 

be  assigned  to  the  δ-MoN  phase.  Besides,  in  both  spectra  there  is  an  extra  component  at 

higher  binding  energies  that  can  be  ascribed  to  different  causes:  unscreened  peaks  of  the 
present  phases  as  observed  for  MoO2  [23],  the  presence  of  Mo4+  associated  to  MoO2 

impurities  or  as  a  consequence  of  overlooking  possible  asymmetric  behavior  of  the  main 

components, as suggested for MoO2 [24]. 

The  dependence  of  Tc  with  the  thickness  for  annealed  films  was  analyzed  measuring  the 

electrical  resistance  as  function  of  the  temperature.  To  understand  the  influence  of  the 

thermal  annealing  on  the  electrical  properties,  initially  a  170  nm  thick  MoN  film  was 
annealed at different temperatures (see Fig. 5a). As-grown thin films display a RRR »

 0.8 

(indicative  of  high  disorder  with  very  short  electronic  mean  free  path  l).  After 
crystallization to d -MoN (at »

 600 °C), the films show a metallic behavior. For [170-600] 

and  [170-700],  the  RRR  values  are  »

  1.3  and  »

  1.5,  and  they  display  a  superconducting 

transition  with  Tc  =  10.5  K  and  11.2  K,  respectively  (see  inset  Fig.  5a).  The 
superconducting transition width (defined as in Fig. 5b) is »

 1 K for [170-600] and »

 0.6 K 

[170-700]. A common feature for films with different thickness is that for longer annealing 

periods (> 30min) or for higher annealing temperatures (> 700°C), neither Tc is increased 

 
6 

nor  the  superconducting  transition  width  is  reduced.  In  particular,  annealing  temperatures 

higher  than  800  °C  produce  cracks  on  the  surface,  which  is  evidenced  in  wider 

superconducting  transitions  without  percolation.  Figure  5b  shows  the  superconducting 

transition observed for films with different thickness after annealing at 700 °C. The results 

show that Tc is gradually suppressed by thickness even for films as thicker as 100 nm (Tc = 
10.7 K). For epitaxial  d -MoN thin films, the reduction in Tc is usually observed for films 

thinner than 40 nm [27]. In our case, Tc for d = 40 nm decreases to 7.2 K, indicating that the 

thickness  affects  the  crystallization.  The  results  obtained  for  [170-600]  and  [170-700] 

suggest that the thickness dependence of Tc may be related to changes in the disorder and in 

the  average  grain  size.  Detailed  studies  of  the  microstructure  are  necessary  to  clarify  this 

point. 

Following  we  analyzed  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  upper  critical  field  Hc2  (T)  for 

[170-600] and [170-700], which allows to analyze the influence of Tc on Hc2 (T) for the 3 
dimensional (3D) limit (d >> coherence length x ). Figure 6 shows Hc2 (T) for the [170-600] 

and [170-700] with the magnetic field perpendicular (

2cH ) and parallel (

//

2cH ) to the surface. 

Inset in Fig. 6 shows comparison between Hc2 and the irreversibility line (Hirr, related to the 
superconducting  transition  width  D T).  The  results  show  negligible  upper  critical  field 

anisotropy  (g   = ^

2cH /

  1),  which  is  in  agreement  with  the  expectations  for  3D 

polycrystalline thin films. The temperature dependence of 

2cH can be analyzed by the WHH 

model developed for dirty one-band superconductors [25], which is given by:

quantifies  the  weakening  influence  of  the  Pauli  electron  spin  paramagnetism  on  the

The  parameter  α  =  0  corresponds  to  a  pure  “orbital  field  limit”  due  to  supercurrents 

circulating around the vortex cores. The Hc2(0) obtained from the extrapolation to zero field 
of the WHH model are 7.5 T (x  (0) = 6.6 nm) and 7.8 T (x  (0) = 6.5 nm) for [170-600] and 

[170-700],  respectively.  These  values  are  lower  than  the  »

  10  T  previously  obtained  in 

epitaxial  and  dirty  d -MoN  sintered  for  polymer  assisted  deposition  [27].  From  very  basic 

considerations  x 0 (cid:181)

  vF/Tc,  where  vF  is  the  Fermi  velocity  [28].  Similar  x 0Tc  values  (»

  70 

nm*K) are obtained for [170-600] and [170-700] and the films reported in Ref [27] (x 0Tc = 

5.6 nm*12.6 K), which indicates that the reduction in Hc2(0) can be mainly attributed to the 

suppression of Tc (corresponding to films in the dirty limit with very short electronic mean 

free path l). 

Finally,  for  comparison  with  d -MoN  obtained  by  chemical  methods  [12,15],  the  Jc  (H) 

dependences at 4.5 K for [100-700] and [170-700] were obtained (see Fig. 7). At low fields 

both samples display thermal vortex jumps, which affect the magnetization (see inset Fig. 
7).  The  Jc  (H)  dependences  are  plotted  for  m 0H  >  0.05  T.  The  obtained  values  Jc  at  low 
fields are »
 1.8 MAcm-2 [170-700], which are comparable to 
those reported for epitaxial thin films in refs. [12] and [15] (with values above 1 MA cm-2 

 1.24 MAcm-2[100-700] and »

for T = 4.5 K].  

4. Conclusions  

In  summary,  we  report  on  the  synthesis  and  the  superconducting  properties  in 
nanocrystalline  d -MoN  thin  films.  Initially,  amorphous  MoN  thin  films  were  grown  by 

reactive  sputtering  at  room  temperature  on  Si  wafers.  In  a  second  step,  the  films  were 

crystallized in vacuum to avoid surface contamination, at temperatures between 600 °C and 

700 °C. The annealed films display very smooth surfaces (relevant for tunnel junctions) and 

a  polycrystalline  microstructure  with  nanometric  grain  size.  The  superconducting  critical 

temperature Tc is strongly affected by the film thickness. Films thicker than 100 nm display 

 
 
 
8 

Tc > 10 K, being 11.2 K for d = 170 nm. The reported simple process to synthesize d -MoN 

thin  films  with  adequate  physical  properties  on  Si  substrates  enhances  its  potential  for 

developing  different  technological  applications,  varying  from  radiation  sensors  to 

Josephson tunnel junctions.
