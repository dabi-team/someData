Abstract—In this work, sidebands suppression induced by the
buffer gas argon (Ar) in 852 nm cesium Faraday anomalous
dispersion optical ﬁlter (FADOF) is investigated. FADOF perfor-
mances at different Ar pressures (0 torr, 1 torr, 5 torr and 10 torr)
are compared, and a single-peak transmittance spectrum with
peak transmittance up to 80% is achieved when the pressure of
Ar reaches 5 torr. A detailed analysis shows that, this sidebands
suppression comes from the depopulation enhancement by the
buffer gas. This result can be generalized to other FADOFs with
similar level structures such as the D2 lines of other alkali metal
atoms.

I. INTRODUCTION

A S the most commonly used atomic optical ﬁlter, Faraday

anomalous dispersion optical ﬁlter (FADOF), which is
based on the resonant Faraday effect, is well known for the
high transmittance, the narrow bandwidth and the excellent
out-of-band rejection [1]–[3]. These properties make it an
important device in the ﬁelds as free-space optical commu-
nication [4], lidar [5]–[7], laser frequency stabilization [8]. In
recent years, with the development of the technology and other
subjects, the areas which are in demand of FADOF are ob-
servably increased, and FADOF is widely used in more ﬁelds
such as ghost imaging [9], single photon generation [10], laser
mode selection, which are also called Faraday laser [11]–[14],
optical frequency standard [15], atomic spectrum recordance
[16], magnetometer [17], Raman spectroscopy [18], [19], and
the research of mollow triplet effect [20]. For convenience in
more applications and researches, a known useful tool ElecSus
which could easily analyze the alkali metal D line FADOF at
the extremely weak input signal is also provided [21].

Fig. 1. Experiment setup and level structure. Fig. 1(a) is the experiment
setup. P1 and P2 are a pair of orthogonal polarizers, between which is the
cesium vapor cell and the magnetic ﬁeld. Fig. 1(b) is the level structure of
852 nm FADOF [28]. Due to the hyperﬁne sublevels of 6S1/2 and 6P3/2, the
transmittance spectra of the ﬁlter exhibit multi-peak form.

FADOF is usually realized by alkali metal vapor cells [1],
[22], and will exhibits multi-peak transmittance spectra due
to the hyperﬁne structure of alkali elements [18], [23]–[25].
However, in some speciﬁc applications such as laser frequency
stabilization, Faraday laser, atomic spectrum recordance and
single photon generation [8], [10]–[14], [16], FADOF is used
to select signal light within an extremely narrow bandwidth. In
such cases, multiple peaks will introduce extra light modes and
more noises, which could be vital for the system. Thus, new
methods to suppress the sidebands of FADOF are signiﬁcant.

Some efforts have been made to suppress the sidebands.
Rotondaro et al. showed that
the transmittance spectrum
could exhibit a narrow single peak form if the magnetic ﬁeld
direction and the laser path form a speciﬁc angle, while the
spectrum is too sensitive to this angle [26]. Another method
is to use the buffer gas. Buffer gas is one of the common
methods to suppress the doppler absorption and change the
atomic spectrum. Inspired by this phenomenon, we tried a
FADOF at 780 nm using a rubidium cell ﬁlled with buffer gas
of 2 torr argon, and acquired a single peak spectrum with
the peak transmittance of about 30% [27]. Limited by the
resources, this work is lack of the detailed analysis or the
explanation.

In this Letter, using cesium atomic vapor cells ﬁlled with
argon of different pressures (0 torr, 1 torr, 5 torr and 10 torr),
the inﬂuence of the buffer gas on the Cs 852 nm FADOF is
investigated in details. Results show that the multiple peaks are
efﬁciently suppressed by the buffer gas Ar, and the single-peak
transmittance spectra can be achieved under high Ar pressures.
An explanation ascribed to the enhanced depopulation effect
by the buffer gas is also given. This suppression phenomenon

Fig. 2. The measured transmittance spectra at different magnetic ﬁeld
strengths, which reveal the sidebands suppression. The temperature is 44 ◦C.
The magnetic ﬁeld strengths of Fig. 2(a)–Fig. 2(f) are 200 G, 500 G, 700 G,
900 G, 1100 G and 1300 G, respectively. The laser spot diameter is 2.3 mm,
and the laser power is 700 µW

has also been found in the cell ﬁlled with buffer gas Xe.

II. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS

The experiment setup is shown in Fig. 1. Four Cesium vapor
cells (all 6 cm in length and 2 cm in width) ﬁlled with different
pressures of Ar are prepared. The strength of the magnetic ﬁeld
and the temperature are tunable.

Results for the inﬂuence of buffer gas Ar on the transmit-
tance spectra at different magnetic ﬁeld strengths are shown
in Fig. 2, the temperature is set to 44 ◦C, and the magnetic
ﬁeld strengths of Fig. 2(a)–Fig. 4(f) are 200 G, 500 G, 700
G, 900 G, 1100 G and 1300 G, respectively. The laser power
in the experiment is 700 µW , and the diameter of the laser
spot is 2.3 mm. The pressures of Ar compared in Fig. 2 are
0 torr, 5 torr and 10 torr. Due to the hyperﬁne sublevels of
6S1/2 and 6P3/2, when there is not buffer gas, the transmittance
spectra of 852 nm FADOF exhibit multi-peak forms(blue lines
in Fig. 2), and they become complicated as the magnetic ﬁeld
increases. The central peak is formed when the magnetic ﬁeld
is greater than 900 G, and the highest point is reached at 1100
G. When the buffer gas is added, the sidebands are observably
suppressed (red and green lines in Fig. 2), while the central
peak still holds the high transmittance (Fig. 2(d,e,f)). Higher
Ar pressures will introduce the stronger suppression effect.

It is obvious from Fig. 2 that the highest transmittance for all
pressures of Ar is reached when the magnetic ﬁeld is 1100 G.
The sidebands have been obviously suppressed by the buffer

Fig. 3. The measured transmittance spectra at 44 ◦C and 1100 G. The
pressures of Ar in Fig. 3(a)–Fig. 3(d) are 0 torr, 1 torr, 5 torr and 10 torr,
respectively. The red lines are the doppler absorption. The laser spot diameter
is 2.3 mm, and the laser power is 700 µW

gas and a high single peak remains at this point. For 5 torr
Ar, the transmittance is up to 80%. The stronger magnetic
ﬁeld will decrease the peak transmittance because of the over
Faraday rotation beyond 90 degree [1]. A comparison of the
results at 1100 G magnetic ﬁeld with different Ar pressures is
shown in Fig. 3. The pressures of Ar for Fig. 3(a)–Fig. 3(d) are
0 torr, 1 torr, 5 torr and 10 torr, respectively, these four graphs
clearly reveal the variation of the transmittance spectra at the
inﬂuence of the buffer gas Ar. The corresponding doppler
absorption signals are also obtained, which can account for
the slightly decreased central peak transmittance.

The suppression effect can be evaluated by the equivalent
noise bandwidth (ENBW): ENBW = R +∞
−∞ T (ν)dν/TMax [2], in
which ν is the detunning, TMax is the peak-transmittance, and
T (ν) is the transmittance as a function of the detunning. In
Fig. 3(a)–(d), ENBWs are calculated as 10.6 GHz, 7.0 GHz,
4.0 GHz, and 3.9 GHz, respectively.

III. ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS

In Fig. 2, The transmittance spectra exhibit central and
wing proﬁles under different magnetic ﬁelds. However, it is
obvious that only the sidebands are signiﬁcantly suppressed
by the buffer gas, while the central transmittance remains. An
explanation from the depopulation effect of optical pumping
is given as following.

We choose the results at 44 ◦C and 1100 G to analyze
the spectra. A typical pressure for Ar is 5 torr, at which the
sidebands are suppressed observably and a high single-peak
remains.

The transitions of cesium account for our work are shown
in Fig. 4(b). The transitions marked with red arrows (A, C) in
Fig. 4(b.3) are induced by the right circularly polarized light,
and those marked with blue arrows (B, D) are induced by the
left circularly polarized light. The relative intensities of these
transitions are displayed in Fig. 4(c).

The transmittance which depends upon the optical rotation
effect is proportional to the population in the lower levels [1],
[29]. The depopulation effect caused by the input light will
decrease the population in the lower levels and thus restrain the
optical rotation effect. As a result, the transmittance is reduced.
A strong absorption of the input light will also reduce the
transmittance. Hence, the high transmittance can only exhibit
in the frequency range with the remarkable optical rotation
effect, but without the strong depopulation effect or the strong
absorption of the signal light.

For transitions A and D, atoms will be pumped from
mS = 1/2 (6S1/2) to mS = −1/2 (6S1/2), and from mS = −1/2
(6S1/2) to mS = 1/2 (6S1/2), which will bring the depopulation
effect. But for transitions B and C, which represent mS = 1/2
(6S1/2) to mJ = 3/2 (6P3/2) and mS = −1/2 (6S1/2) to
mJ = −3/2 (6P3/2), atoms can only return to the original lower
levels. That is, transitions B and C cannot decrease the atoms
in the lower levels and cannot bring the depopulation effect.

Fig. 4. Analysis diagram. Fig. 4(a) shows the transmittance spectra at 44 ◦C
and 1100 G, in which the pressures of Ar are 0 torr and 5torr. In Fig. 4(b),
(b.1) shows the hyperﬁne structures of 6S1/2 and 6P3/2 of cesium, (b.2) is the
Zeeman splitting for these two levels, and the level structures at 1100 G are in
(b.3). The magnetic quantum number of electron mS for the red sublevels of
6S1/2 is −1/2, and for the blue sublevels is 1/2. As for 6P3/2, the sublevels
are marked with four colors, and the magnetic quantum numbers of electron
mJ for them are 3/2, 1/2, −1/2 and −3/2, respectively. The positions and
relative intensities of transitions in Fig. 4(b.3) are displayed in Fig. 4(c).

When the buffer gas is introduced, it will increase the relax-
ation time [30], which will weaken the relaxation effect and
make the depopulation effect remarkable. When the magnetic
ﬁeld is weak, the sidebands arise due to the transitions A,
B and C, D. But for the zero detuning, no dispersion of
transitions superposes here, and cannot produce the central
peak. Most atoms in the lower levels will be depopulated by
transitions A and D. Thus, with the buffer gas in the cell, when
the probe laser frequency is tuned to these transitions, only
small amounts of atoms can populate in the lower levels due to
the strong depopulation effect caused by the weak relaxation.
The optical rotation effect at these frequency ranges is then
suppressed, and so is the transmittance. The suppression effect
goes stronger as the pressure of Ar increases.

3

For transitions B and C, atoms in the lower levels cannot be
depopulated, and cannot bring the suppression effect. When
the magnetic ﬁeld increases, and in the frequency range
near the zero detuning, only the strong dispersion and weak
absorption of transitions B and C superpose here, which
cannot depopulate atoms in the lower levels. Thus, the strong
optical rotation effect and the weak absorption make the high
transmittance of the central peak.

IV. CONCLUSION

The inﬂuence of the buffer gas Ar on the transmittance
spectrum of 852 nm cesium FADOF is experimentally inves-
tigated. Ar buffer gases under different pressures are ﬁlled
in the cesium vapor cell. The results show that, due to
the depopulation effect by the buffer gas,
the multi-peak
sidebands are signiﬁcantly suppressed. The retained single-
peak is contributed by the transitions that cannot depopulate
atoms from the lower levels, and the vanished sidebands are by
the transitions which bring the depopulation effect. Our result
can be used for other atoms with similar level structures.
