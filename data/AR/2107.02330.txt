Abstract
A double-phase Ar detector can eﬃciently identify particles and reconstruct their positions. However, the properties of electrolumi-
nescence (EL) for secondary light emission in the gas phase are not fully understood. Earlier studies have explained the EL process
using an ordinary EL mechanism because of an Ar excimer; however, this mechanism does not predict the emission of visible light
(VL). Recent measurements have demonstrated VL components in Ar gas EL, to explain which a new mechanism called neutral
bremsstrahlung (NBrS) was proposed. In this study, we investigated gaseous Ar EL in the VL region from 300 to 600 nm at room
temperature and normal pressure using a gaseous time projection chamber (TPC). The secondary emission light from the TPC
luminescence region was dispersed using a spectrometer. The observed spectrum was interpreted using the ordinary EL and NBrS
models, and the eﬀect of nitrogen impurities is discussed herein.

1. Introduction

Liquid Ar is widely used as a radiation detector in particle
physics experiments [1, 2, 3]. The most important feature of
a liquid Ar detector is that it induces two signals: scintillation
photons and ionization electrons. The combination of these sig-
nals provides useful information for applications such as parti-
cle identiﬁcation and position reconstruction. In particular, the
double-phase argon detector technique is employed in experi-
ments for dark matter detection [2]. The ionization electrons
drifting upwards are extracted from the liquid to gas phases un-
der a high electric ﬁeld (few kV/cm). Subsequently, the ioniza-
tion electrons emit proportional electroluminescence (EL) by
scattering on the gaseous Ar (GAr) atoms.

Figure 1 is a simpliﬁed diagram of the EL mechanism of
GAr. It describes three emission processes for pure GAr (here-
inafter called “ordinary EL”). Two of them are well-known pro-
cesses: 128-nm vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light because of
transitions of Ar excimers,

Ar∗

2 → 2Ar + hν (VUV : 128nm),

(1)

and 700–850 nm infrared light (IR) owing to Ar atomic emis-
sion,

Ar∗(3p54p1) → Ar∗(3p54s1) + hν (IR : 700 − 850nm). (2)

The third one is a 170–300 nm ultraviolet light (UV) emission
that occurs due to the transitions of Ar molecular ions (here-
inafter called “third continuum”) [4],

Ar2+

2 → 2Ar+ + hν (UV : 170 − 300nm),

which is not well understood.

The EL process was explained by the ordinary mechanism,
but without VL emissions. Recent measurements, however,
demonstrated the presence of VL components in the EL of GAr,
which was explained by Buzulutskov et al.
[5] using a new
mechanism called neutral bremsstrahlung (NBrS). Because VL
photons are easier to detect using photosensors than VUV pho-
tons, the use of VL components in particle detectors has been
actively discussed [6, 7], and a detailed understanding of the
wavelength spectrum is important for such applications. Fig-
ure 2 illustrates the results of theoretical calculations of the EL
emission yields as a function of a reduced electric ﬁeld (E/N)
at room temperature (300 K) for the ordinary EL model (top)
[8] and the NBrS model (middle) [5]. Although ordinary EL
lights emit only above the 4-Td threshold, NBrS light also emits

length spectra are depicted in the bottom plot of Figure 2 [5].
The spectrum is a continuous distribution from 200 to 1,000
nm, which is diﬀerent from that of ordinary EL light.

As shown in Fig. 1, VL emissions (300–450 nm) for the Ar-
nitrogen gas mixture due to the nitrogen excimer are given by
the following process [9]:

E/N is deﬁned as the electric ﬁeld per molecular density of
the Ar gas. The molecular density is inversely proportional
to the temperature. E/N at temperatures T1 to T2 is given by
= T2/T1 with the same electric ﬁeld and pres-
(E/N)T1/(E/N)T2
sure. Thus, 1 Td at 87 K is equivalent to 3.4 Td at 300 K with
the same pressure and electric ﬁeld.

Nitrogen emission has a similar E/N dependence as the ordi-
nary EL with a 4-Td threshold, as it occurs due to the transition
of Ar∗. It is known that more than 1 ppm of nitrogen impurity
in liquid Ar degrades the Ar scintillation light [10]. Thus, the
nitrogen impurity inside the liquid phase is usually controlled at
less than 1 ppm for liquid Ar double-phase detectors. However,
the nitrogen impurity in the gas phase can be higher because
the boiling point of N (77 K) is less than that of Ar (87 K), and
nitrogen impurities tend to concentrate in the gas phase after a
certain amount of time. Thus, the eﬀect of nitrogen impurities
should be carefully considered in order to understand the VL
components.

trometer, and VL and VUV photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) (bottom).

Figure 3 shows a schematic of the experimental setup of a
GAr TPC with a ﬁducial volume of length 130 mm and diame-
ter 64 mm. The TPC was constructed with polytetraﬂuoroethy-
lene (PTFE) and Cu ﬁeld shaping rings. No wavelength shifter
was used to measure pure Ar luminescence. The grid was
placed 10 mm away from the anode, after which the anode and
cathode were used to generate luminescence and drift ﬁelds, re-
spectively. The anode was transparent indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-
coated quartz, which had a transmittance of more than 95% for
VL (>300 nm). An α-ray source (241Am, 300 Bq) was placed
inside the TPC for signals.

The TPC was placed inside a vacuum vessel with a quartz
viewport. A spectrometer (Shimadzu Corporation SPG-120S)
was placed outside the vessel near the viewport. We attached 2
mm slits to both the inlet and outlet of the spectrometer. The

represented by red characters represent the light yield at room temperature (300

In this study, detailed measurements of the wavelength spec-
trum of GAr EL in the VL region (300–600 nm) were con-
ducted under electric ﬁelds up to E/N = 10 Td at room tem-
perature (300 K) and normal pressure (1 bar) using a spectrom-
eter. Then, the spectra obtained using ordinary EL and NBrS
and nitrogen impurity are interpreted. Note that these emis-
sion processes are described as functions of a reduced electric
ﬁeld E/N when they are weakly associated with temperature
and pressure at the same E/N. Thus, the results of the mea-
surement at room temperature and normal pressure are also ap-
plicable to the liquid Ar temperature (87 K) for the same E/N.

These E/N values were chosen to match the mea-
surements and theoretical calculations in [5].

• Data for electric ﬁeld dependence

High-purity G1 gas was used to obtain these data. The
luminescence ﬁeld was scanned from 1 to 8 Td with 1-Td
pitch at 300, 400, and 500 nm. Additional data for the 300
nm wavelength were obtained at 10 Td.

• Data for nitrogen eﬀect

N10 and N100 gases were used for acquiring these data.
The spectrometer wavelength was scanned from 240 to
660 nm with a 20-nm pitch at a luminescence ﬁeld of 8.3
Td. The spectrometer wavelength for the N100 gas was
scanned from 300 to 450 nm with a 2.5-nm pitch. Six ad-
ditional wavelength datasets (316, 337, 358, 381, 406, and
434 nm) corresponding to the resonant wavelength of ni-
trogen emission were taken for the G1 and N10 gases [9].

Note that 1 Td of the reduced electric ﬁeld in the lumines-
cence region (room temperature, normal pressure, and 1 cm lu-
minescence region) corresponds to 245 V/cm.

3. Results

The primary scintillation light (S1) and ionization electrons
were produced by the interaction between the α-ray and the
GAr atoms. The typical ﬂight distance of the α-ray was 3 cm.
The ionization electrons drifted in the direction of the grid un-
der a ﬁxed drift ﬁeld of 100 V/cm (0.4 Td). The electrons emit-
ted secondary EL lights (S2) when they were in the 1 cm gap
between the grid and the anode under a luminescence ﬁeld (1–
10 Td).

distance between the anode and the outlet slit was approxi-
mately 250 mm. Figure 4 shows the responses of the spec-
trometer to monochromatic laser light with wavelengths of 450
nm (left) and 520 nm (right). These responses were approxi-
mately modeled by triangular functions T (λ) around the peak
wavelength λpeak,

where the width of the function w = 14 nm, and the height of the
peak A = 1. We observed a 5 nm shift in the responses caused
by the combination of performances of the spectrometer and
input laser. This shift was a source of systematic uncertainties
observed in the measurements.

Figure 5: Quantum eﬃciencies of the two PMTs (VUV PMT and VL PMT)
used in this measurement as a function of the wavelength.

Two PMTs with diﬀerent wavelength sensitivities were ar-
ranged near the spectrometer and cathode. The PMT near the
spectrometer (Hamamatsu-R11065 “VL PMT” in this study),
which had a quartz window, was sensitive to UV and VL, while
that near the cathode (Hamamatsu-R6835 called “VUV PMT”),
which had a MgF2 window, was only sensitive to VUV (Fig. 5).
A ﬂash analog-to-digital converter (ADC; Struck Innovative
Systeme SIS3316-250-14) with a sampling rate of 250 Ms/s and
a resolution of 14 bits was used to read the PMT signals.

The vacuum vessel was depressurized to 10−2 Pa using a
molecular turbo pump for at least one day before each mea-
surement. Subsequently, the detector was ﬁlled with GAr at
room temperature and normal pressure. The gas was pumped at
a constant ﬂow rate of 10 L/min during the experiment to avoid
impurities from outgassing. To evaluate the eﬀect of nitrogen
impurities, three admixtures of Ar and nitrogen gases (G1, N10,
and N100) were used in this measurement. The speciﬁcations
of the gases are listed in Table 1.

The typical waveform distributions measured by the Flash
ADC are illustrated in Fig. 6. The top and bottom plots cor-
respond to the VUV PMT and VL PMT signals, respectively.
These distributions were obtained without a spectrometer. The
actual light yield of the VL PMT with a spectrometer was less
than one photoelectron (PE). The sharp peak for the VUV PMT
at t = 0 corresponds to the S1 signal, while the broad peak at
approximately t = 15 µs corresponds to the S2 signal.

Five light yields (S1, S2, Signal, BG1, and BG2) were cal-
culated by integrating the waveform distributions of the VUV

vals are indicated by the hatched regions in Fig. 6. Events
were selected using S1 and S2 in the red box in the top-left
plot in Fig. 7. Data for the plot were obtained at a spectrom-
eter wavelength of 400 nm and a luminescence ﬁeld of 8.3 Td
using G1 gas, and 137,684 events were selected (N0). Distri-
butions of Signal, BG1, and BG2 for the selected events are
depicted in the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right plots
of Fig. 7, respectively. As mentioned earlier, no photons were
observed most of the time, and the peaks around 100 counts
corresponded to single PE events. The VL PMT was operated
with gain for single PE events of approximately 130 counts, and
the PMT had distinct separation between the noise level and
the single PE events [11]. The single PE events were selected
based on the light yields within the range of 30–300 counts,
and the selected events were NSignal = 943, NBG1 = 166, and
NBG2=502 for Signal, BG1, and BG2, respectively. The signal
region contained background events, mainly due to the acciden-
tal coincidence of the PMT dark counts. Background contam-
ination was estimated using BG1 and BG2 normalized to the
window width, NBackground = (25 µs/60 µs) × (NBG1 + NBG2) =
278, and the number of events after background subtraction was
NSignal − NBackground = 665. Assuming that the light yield fol-
lowed a Poisson distribution, the light yield in the unit of PEs
equaled the fraction of events in the single PE peak is (NSignal −
NBackground)/N0 = 0.00483.

By repeating the same analysis steps for diﬀerent conﬁgu-
rations (spectrometer wavelength, luminescence ﬁeld, and gas

type), we obtained the desired spectrum. The left plot in Fig. 8
illustrates the obtained wavelength spectra using G1 gas at a
luminescence ﬁeld of 8.3 Td. The blue, red, and black points
denote the light yields in the signal, background, and signal–
background region, respectively. As the light yield in the back-
ground region was steadily constant, the average value (red
line) was used for subtraction. Finally, the wavelength spec-
trum (right plot in Fig. 8) was obtained after correcting for the
VL PMT quantum eﬃciency in Fig. 5). Two sources of system-
atic uncertainties were considered for the observed light yield.

• PMT quantum eﬃciency.

As discussed in the previous section, the wavelength of
light after passing through the spectrometer followed the
distribution described by Eq. 6, and a systematic shift of
±5 nm was observed for the spectrometer. Thus, the wave-
length to be used to calculate the quantum eﬃciency of
the VL PMT is uncertain. The diﬀerence in quantum eﬃ-
ciency when changing the wavelength ±7 nm was assigned
as the systematic uncertainty of the observed light yield.

• Reproducibility of measurement

The stability of measurement during the data-acquisition
period was estimated by repeating the measurement. A
relative uncertainty of 5% was assigned to the observed
light yield.

The red inner error bars in the right plot of Fig 8 demonstrate
statistical uncertainty, and the outer error bars with black color
represent the total (

statistical2 + systematic2) uncertainty.

The wavelength spectra obtained are shown in Fig. 9. The
left plot shows the spectra for the G1 gas with electric ﬁelds of
4.6 Td (green points) and 8.3 Td (black points). The right plot
shows the spectra for the G1 gas (black points), N10 gas (blue
points), and N100 gas (red points) at E/N = 8.3 Td. The trans-
mittance of the ITO-quartz degraded for the wavelength below
300 nm, and there were background contributions from the sec-
ondary light of the spectrometer for the wavelength above 600
nm (300 nm×2). Thus, a wavelength range of 300–600 nm was
used for the rest of the analysis.

data points (300 nm with 2 Td and 500 nm with 4 Td) were
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of the ﬁtted function. Note
that the result did not change signiﬁcantly, even after excluding
the two points from the ﬁt. The bottom-right plot in Figure 10
shows S EL as a function of wavelength. The scale factor at 300
nm was the largest because of the signiﬁcant UV contribution
from the third continuum emission in Eq. (3). However, the
scale factor at 500 nm was consistent with zero within its un-
certainty. Although the spectrum of the ordinary EL emission
is not entirely understood, the wavelength dependence of the
scale factors is approximately a straight line,

4. Discussion

4.1. Electric Field Dependence

Figure 10 illustrates the results of the electric ﬁeld depen-
dence data at three wavelengths. The wavelength around each
nominal wavelength had an interval of approximately 14 nm
(width w of the spectrometer in Eq (6)). Light rays were ob-
served in low electric ﬁelds below 4 Td. The light yields ap-
peared saturated at higher electric ﬁelds. Thus, the ordinary EL
model is not enough to explain these distributions. To quanti-
tatively estimate the contribution of the NBrS model, the data
points were simultaneously ﬁtted to the following function,

FAr(λ, E/N) = S EL(λ)FEL(E/N) + S NBrSFNBrS(λ, E/N).(7)

FEL(E/N) and FNBrS(λ, E/N) are the light yield functions for
the ordinary EL and NBrS models in Fig. 2, respectively. The
scale factors, S EL(λ) and S NBrS, were determined by the ﬁt.

The ﬁt results are summarized in Table 3, and the ﬁtted func-
tions in Figure 10. The χ2/ndf of the ﬁt was 41.9/25, which is
marginally worse than that of the ﬁtted function because two

The eﬃciency was mainly ascribed to the geometrical accep-

the luminescence region to the outlet slit (25 cm), and the size

plained by the transmittance of the ITO quartz and the quartz
viewport (approximately 95% each), and the eﬃciency of the
spectrometer (>50% [13]). Thus, the absolute value of the ob-
served light yield of this measurement was approximately con-
sistent with the prediction of the NBrS model.

4.3. Wavelength Spectrum

Because the scale factors for the ordinary EL model (S EL)
and the NBrS model (S NBrS) help predict all wavelengths men-
tioned in the previous section, the model function of Eq. (7) ex-
plains the wavelength spectrum. Figure 11 depicts an overlay
of the model functions to the wavelength spectrum data at the
reduced electric ﬁelds of 8.3 Td (top) and 4.6 Td (bottom). The
χ2/nd f values between the data points and the model functions
were 16.4/16 and 32.0/16 for the 8.3 and 4.6 Td data, respec-
tively. The spectrum data and model functions were in good
agreement, except for two data points (340 and 360 nm with
4.6 Td). In this analysis, the spectrum for ordinary EL emis-
sion was modeled using a straight line (Eq. (8)). However, the
spectrum of G1 gas with 8.3 Td (Fig. 9) showed a signiﬁcant
discontinuity below 300 nm, which points to the existence of a
resonant-type structure for the ordinary EL emission. A ﬁner-
wavelength scan with more statistics will be required for a de-
tailed explanation of ordinary EL emission. The spectrum at
4.6 Td was explained by the nearly pure NBrS emission, and
the contribution of the EL emission was less than 10%.

a signiﬁcant excess between 300 and 400 nm in the N100 data
due to nitrogen. However, the N100, N10, and G1 wavelength
spectra are consistent above a wavelength of 450 nm. Thus,
we assumed that there were no signiﬁcant nitrogen contribu-
tions above 450 nm. Figure 12 shows the wavelength spectra
from 300 to 450 nm with an electric ﬁeld of 8.3 Td using G1
gas (black points), N10 gas (blue points), and N100 gas (red
points), respectively. The model curves of NBrS (dotted black
line) and NBrS + ordinary EL (solid black line) are shown (the
same curves as in Fig. 11). The N100 gas data had six reso-
nant structures consistent with the measurements reported by
Takahashi et al.[9]. The peak wavelengths (λpeak,i) and heights
(Ai) of the resonances were obtained by ﬁtting the N100 spectra
using a model function:

4.4. Nitrogen Eﬀect

As mentioned earlier, a possible explanation for the VL com-
ponent of the EL emission other than the NBrS model is the
nitrogen excimer emission. This eﬀect was estimated using an
Ar–N gas mixture. The right hand-side plot in Figure 9 shows

The wavelength spectrum with N10 gas was modeled using

the following function,

FN10(λ) = FAr(λ) + α

6(cid:88)

i=1

Ti(λ),

(14)

where FAr and Ti(λ) have the same functions as those in
Eqs. (12). The scale, α, was determined by ﬁtting the data
points to the wavelength spectrum Thus, α = 0.12 ± 0.01 was
obtained, which is consistent with the ratio of the nitrogen con-
tent of N10 (10 ± 1 ppm) to N100 (100 ± 10 ppm), i.e., 0.1. In
addition, the G1 data were ﬁtted to the model function,

FG1(λ) = βFAr(λ) + α

6(cid:88)

i=1

Ti(λ),

(15)

and the ﬁt result showed that α = 0.001 ± 0.007 and β =
0.96 ± 0.03. Therefore, the residual nitrogen impurity in the
G1 data was 0.1 ± 0.7 ppm, which is consistent with the un-
certainty of 0 ppm. In summary, a small amount of nitrogen
impurities (>10 ppm) can cause VL emission from 300 to 450
nm. However, the G1 data of this measurement contained nitro-
gen impurities of less than 1 ppm, as well as negligible nitrogen
emissions. As shown in Fig. 1, the nitrogen emission was pro-
duced from the transition of Ar∗, which requires at least 4 Td of
the reduced electric ﬁeld. Thus, nitrogen emissions cannot ex-
plain the VL emission below 4 Td. Even if small packets of VL
emissions were produced from unknown impurities inside the
Ar gas, it is highly unlikely that the emission occurred below
4 Td. Thus, NBrS emissions are the most reasonable model to
explain the observed VL emission. In addition, it is possible to
utilize nitrogen emissions in the gas phase for the double-phase
detector if the amount of nitrogen impurities in the liquid phase
can be maintained below 1 ppm.

5. Summary

The GAr EL in the VL region (300 to 600 nm) was studied
using the GAr TPC, with 241Am α-rays as the signal source at
room temperature and normal pressure. The secondary emis-
sion light waves from the TPC luminescence region were dis-
persed using a spectrometer. The wavelength spectrum and
luminescence-ﬁeld dependence of the light yield were com-
pared with those of the ordinary EL and NBrS models. The
eﬀect of nitrogen impurities on the light yield was evaluated
using the Ar-nitrogen mixture gas. We conclude that the ordi-
nary EL model and nitrogen emission alone cannot explain the
wavelength spectrum and electric ﬁeld dependences of the ob-
served light in the VL region. The inclusion of the NBrS model
can enable a comprehensive explanation of the phenomena.
