ABSTRACT
Using integral ﬁeld data we extract the optical spectra of shocked interstellar clouds in Kepler’s
supernova remnant located in the inner regions of our Galaxy, as well as in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), NGC6822 and IC 1613. Using self-consistent shock
modelling, we make a new determination of the chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM)
in N, O, Ne, S, Cl and Ar in these galaxies and obtain accurate estimates of the fraction of refractory
grains destroyed in the shock. By comparing our derived abundances with those obtained in recent
works using observations of B stars, F supergiant stars and HII regions, we provide a new calibration
for abundance scaling in the range 7.9 (cid:46) 12 + log O/H (cid:46) 9.1.

1. INTRODUCTION
An accurate calibration of the extragalactic abundance
scale is fundamental to our understanding of the chemical
evolution of galaxies, since it provides a fossil record of
the eﬀect of generations of star formation, modulated by
both inﬂows of inter-galactic gas, and outﬂows of heavy-
element enhanced gas back into the inter-galactic gas
pool.

Typically, for high redshift studies, we must rely on
“metallicity” calibrations based upon H II regions. How-
ever, commonly used calibrations may disagree by more
than an order of magnitude (Kewley & Ellison 2008).
This discrepancy has many potential causes, including
calibration errors resulting from reliance on measure-
ments of electron temperature Te (Pilyugin & Thuan
2005, 2007), hybrid approaches (van Zee et al. 1998),
relying only on strong emission line methods (McGaugh
1991), or modelling errors associated with calibrating the
theoretical photoionization models (L´opez-S´anchez et al.
2012). Other factors which may play a signiﬁcant role in
the abundance calibration using H II regions are varia-
tions in gas pressure and ionisation parameter, the cali-
bration of the N/O ratio at low metallicity and possible
changes in the shape of the Initial Mass Function (IMF)
(Brinchmann et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2008; Kewley et al.
2013; Blanc et al. 2015; Bian et al. 2016, 2018; Dopita
et al. 2016a).

Many of these issues, as well as the problem of the
corrections due to the fraction of heavy elements locked

in dust grains in the ISM, can be side-stepped by spec-
trophotometric observations of the photospheric abun-
dances of B-stars (Rolleston et al. 2000; Smartt et al.
2001; Korn et al. 2002, 2005; Hunter et al. 2009; Takeda
et al. 2010; Nieva & Przybilla 2012). These stars are
suﬃciently young to present ISM abundances at their
surface, and are relatively simple to model compared
with O-stars (which suﬀer from much stronger stellar
winds, and modiﬁcation of surface abundances from mix-
ing processes such as meridional circulation). However,
the intrinsic brightness of these stars limits detailed spec-
trophotometric studies to galaxies closer than the Virgo
cluster. The stellar calibration can be somewhat ex-
tended in distance by the use of F supergiants (Russell &
Dopita 1992; Andrievsky et al. 2001), but there remains
a question of whether the surface abundances of these
stars has been modiﬁed by stellar evolution. Recently,
Nicholls et al. (2017) have combined both stellar and
nebular abundances to provide an accurate estimate of
the chemical abundances in the ISM close to the sun (the
Local Galactic Concordance or LGC abundance set), and
has provided simple scaling relations to ﬁt stars in the
halo of the Galaxy, and local galaxies.

A direct way to probe abundances in the ISM is to
utilise radiative shocks propagating into dense, pris-
tine interstellar clouds. Such shocks are to be found
within supernova remnants (SNR). This technique was
pioneered by Dopita (1976) and was further developed
by Dopita et al. (1980); Binette et al. (1982) and Russell
& Dopita (1990). These early models either did not in-
clude, or did not fully include, cooling and line radiation
due to refractory elements such as Ca, Mg, Si, Fe and
Ni. Furthermore, the return of these elements to the gas
phase was not taken into account.

Recently, Dopita et al. (2016b) investigated grain de-
struction across the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNR
N49 using integral ﬁeld data, and determined that fast
shocks (vs (cid:38) 250 km/s) appear to rapidly destroy their
dust grains by classical thermal sputtering, but slower
shocks are ineﬀective in their grain destruction until the
dense recombination zone is reached, at which point the

Dopita et al.

dominant dust destruction process is the non-thermal
sputtering and grain-grain collision mechanism advo-
cated by Seab & Shull (1983) and Borkowski & Dwek
(1995). These results were replicated in the more recent
study of another LMC supernova remnant, N132D (Do-
pita et al. 2018).

Given that both the instrumental and analysis tech-
niques have greatly improved since the pioneering Rus-
sell & Dopita (1990) work, we were motivated to ﬁnd
to what extent the calibration of radiative cloud shock
spectroscopy in supernova remnants can complement the
existing data from H II regions, and from stellar spec-
troscopy of young stars, not only in our Galaxy, but in
the Magellanic Clouds and Local Group dwarf galaxies.
We present the results of this study here.
This paper is organised as follows.

In Section 2 we
present the observational material and the extracted line
ﬂuxes. In Section 3 we present the methodology and re-
sults of our self-consistent shock analysis of these data.
In Section 4 we present the derived abundances and the
dust depletion factors for the ions of various refractory
elements, while Section 5 compares our new SNR calibra-
tion of the abundance scale with that derived previously
using stellar or H II region calibrations.

2. OBSERVATIONS & DATA REDUCTION
The integral ﬁeld spectra of these SNR were obtained
using the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) (Dopita
et al. 2007, 2010). This is an integral ﬁeld spectrograph
mounted on the ANU 2.3m telescope at Siding Spring
Observatory, which oﬀers a ﬁeld of view of 25(cid:48)(cid:48)× 38(cid:48)(cid:48)at
a spatial resolution of either 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48)× 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)or 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48)× 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48),
depending on the binning on the CCD. In these observa-
tions, we operated in the binned 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48)x 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48) mode. Most
of the data were obtained in the low resolution mode
R ∼ 3000 (FWHM of ∼ 100 km/s) using the B3000 and
R3000 gratings in each arm of the spectrograph, with
the RT560 dichroic which provides a transition between
the two arms at around 560nm. This gives a continuous
wavelength coverage from 3400–8900˚A. For observations
of the two LMC SNR, N49 and N103B, the R7000 grat-
ing was used in the red (with the RT560 dichroic) giving
a wavelength coverage only up to ∼ 7200˚A. For details
on the various observing modes available on WiFeS, see
Dopita et al. (2007).

The data for the LMC SNR, N49, N103B and N132D
have already been described elsewhere (Dopita et al.
2016b; Ghavamian et al. 2017; Dopita et al. 2018). In
Table 1 we present the log of the observations on the
remaining targets.

The wavelength scale is calibrated using a series of Ne-
Ar or Cu-Ar arc lamp exposures, taken throughout the
night. Arc exposure times are 50s for the B3000 grat-
ing and 1s for the R3000 grating. Flux calibration was
performed using the STIS spectrophotometric standard
stars HD 009051, HD 031128, HD 074000, HD 111980 and
HD 2006548. For SNR Ho12 in NGC6822, HD 128279
and CD-3018140 were used for ﬂux calibration. In addi-
tion, B-type telluric standards HIP 8352, HIP 41323 were
observed to better correct for the OH and H2O telluric
absorption features in the red. The separation of these

the top while for the SMC remnant North is to the right. For
Kepler, the spectral extraction region is shown in yellow, while
the sky subtraction annulus is located between the yellow and the
turquoise circles. See Sankrit et al. (2016) for HST images of this

features by molecular species allows for a more accurate
telluric correction by accounting for night to night varia-
tions in the column density of these two species. All data
cubes were reduced using the PyWiFeS9 data reduction
pipeline (Childress et al. 2014b,a).

2.1. Spectral Extraction
The spectra were extracted from the global WiFeS mo-
saic datacubes using using QFitsView v3.1 rev.74110.
In order to extract the spectrum of the brightest shocked
clouds in the resolved SNR, or to integrate over the whole
SNR in the case of NGC6822 Ho12 and IC1613 S8, we
used a circular extraction aperture sized to best match
the size of the bright region or the full SNR. To remove
the residual night sky emission and (approximately) the
faint stellar contribution, we subtracted a mean sky ref-
erence annulus surrounding the extraction aperture. The
extraction regions were optimised by peaking up the sig-
nal in Hα in the red data cube, and in Hγ in the blue
data cube, respectively.
In ﬁgures 1 to 3 we show the
extraction regions. Clearly, in the case of Kepler’s SNR
and the Magellanic Cloud SNR, we are subtracting the
spectra of fainter parts of the SNR (whose signiﬁcance is
exaggerated in these images by the square-root stretch
that has been used to bring out the fainter regions.

In ﬁgure 4 we show the spectrum of the SNR Ho12 in
NGC6822 to give an idea of the quality of the resultant
extracted spectra.

FWHMs (in ˚A) and the continuum levels were measured
using the interactive routines in Graf11 and in Lines12.
The de-reddened line ﬂuxes relative to Hβ and their un-
certainties along with the measured velocity dispersions,
corrected for instrumental broadening, the adopted loga-
rithmic reddening correction at Hβ (c), and the absolute
Hβ surface brightness in units of erg/cm2/s/arcsec2, are
given for each of the SNR in Tables A1 – A3 in the Ap-
pendix.

Here the reddening has been determined using a Fis-
chera & Dopita (2005) foreground reddening screen with
a total to selective extinction R = 4.5. This model is
more realistic than a standard extinction law in extended
objects, since it accounts for the fractal-like nature of the
foreground attenuating dust screen, which avoids over-
correction in the UV. Given that the models (described
below) predict the intrinsic ﬂux of Hα to be in excess
of three times that of Hβ as a result of collisional exci-
tation to the n = 3 level of Hydrogen, we have iterated
the size of reddening correction applied to the observa-
tions to best match the Hα/Hβ/Hγ/Hδ ratios given by
the model.

3. EMISSION LINE DIAGNOSTICS
3.1. Self-Consistent Shock Modelling
To analyse the spectrophotometry we have built a fam-
ily of radiative shocks with self-consistent pre-ionisation
using the MAPPINGS 5.12 code, following the method-
ology described in Sutherland & Dopita (2017), and ap-
plied to the study of Herbig-Haro objects by Dopita &
Sutherland (2017) and to the LMC SNR N132D (Dopita
et al. 2018). In these models, the ionisation state of the
gas entering the shock is determined by the EUV pho-
tons generated in the cooling zone of the radiative shock,
and these models have an extended photoionisation zone
running ahead of the shock. Although the photoionized
precursor can, in principle, produce up to ∼ 25% of the
Hβ ﬂux produced by the radiative shock, shock curva-
ture and the ﬁnite extent of the radiative shock means
that most of the ionising photons escape from the pre-
cursor region, and will instead produce an extended halo
of photoionized gas around the SNR. Thus, in our pre-
vious modelling, we have ignored the contribution of the
emission from the precursor.

duced to rest wavelength, and then emission-line ﬂuxes in

photo-ionised precursor (as the gas enters the shock) is
assumed to be in equipartition with the gas pressure,
Pmag = Pgas, and the temperature of the gas entering
the shock is given by the self-consistent pre-ionisation
computation; see Sutherland & Dopita (2017) for details.
The line spectrum of a radiative shock is primarily de-
termined by three parameters, the ram pressure driv-
ing the shock, the velocity of the shock, and the abun-
dances of elements heavier than Hydrogen. The pre-
shock magnetic ﬁeld is a secondary parameter, since it
serves to limit the post-shock compression factor. For
slower shocks (vs (cid:46) 120 km/s), the pre-shock ionisation
state becomes an important factor, since partial ionisa-
tion of hydrogen entering the shock results in rapid cool-
ing, collisional excitation of neutral hydrogen atoms into
the n = 3 level, and an enhancement in the lines of lower
excitation.

Shocks faster than ∼ 180 km/s cool in a thermally-
unstable manner (Sutherland et al. 2003), in which small
initial inhomogeneities are ampliﬁed during a single cool-
ing timescale to result in a fractal distribution of ﬁla-
ments with enhanced local cooling. Such instabilities are
not captured in the 1-D models presented here, but may
in part be responsible for the lower-velocity shocks which
are a necessary element for our models to provide a good
global ﬁt to the observed spectrum.

Because these SNRs contain denser ISM clouds em-
bedded in a less dense medium, we allow for two shock
velocities driven by a common ram pressure. Typically,
the fast shock will have velocity ∼ 200 km/s, while the
slow shock will have vs ∼ 50 km/s. The velocity of the
slower shock is poorly constrained by the observations.
The relative balance between the contributions of each

of the two shock components is determined during the
L1-norm minimisation procedure. That is to say that
we measure the modulus of the mean logarithmic diﬀer-
ence in ﬂux (relative to Hβ) between the model and the
observations viz.;

the chemical abundances, and use these to estimate the
ram pressure and shock velocity by L1-norm minimisa-
tion. We then reﬁne the abundance set to provide better
agreement to the line ﬂuxes of elements which are less im-
portant than Oxygen in determining the cooling. Next,
we systematically scale the abundances of elements heav-
ier than He over the range ±0.3 dex in steps of 0.05 dex
to determine the best ﬁt abundance set by L1-norm min-
imisation. Finally we vary the shock velocity from 100 to
300 km/s to re-determine the best ﬁt shock velocity by
L1-norm minimisation, and make a ﬁnal reﬁnement to
the abundance set. Further details of this shock ﬁtting
procedure are presented below.

3.2. Derivation of the Shock Parameters
The ram-pressure driving the shocks is determined
primarily using the density-sensitive line ratio [S II]
λλ6731/6717 (which gives the electron density in the
region near the recombination zone of the shock). We

also make use of the density and temperature sensitive
ratios [S II] λλ(4067 + 4076)/(6717 + 6731) and [O II]
λλ(7321 + 7330)/(3727 + 3729) to help constrain the ram
pressure.

The abundance set is initially taken as a scaled Local
Galactic Concordance (LGC) (Nicholls et al. 2017) value
for each galaxy based upon the Oxygen abundances pre-
viously estimated from H II region modelling, of from B-
star measurements, but these are then iterated manually
to achieve a better ﬁt of the theoretical to the observed
spectra once the shock velocity and ram pressure have
been initially determined. In this and subsequent steps,
the mixing fractions of the fast and slow shock contri-
butions are chosen so as to minimise the value of the
L1-norm.

The depletion factors of the heavy elements (caused
by the condensation of these elements onto dust) are de-
ﬁned as the logarithm of the ratio of the gas phase abun-
dance to the total element abundance. The depletion fac-
tors are derived from the formulae of Jenkins (2009), ex-
tended to the other elements on the basis of their conden-
sation temperatures and/or their position on the periodic
table. In these shock models, following the ﬁndings of
Dopita et al. (2016b) and Dopita et al. (2018) we choose
an initial logarithmic Fe depletion, log DFe = −0.5. See
Dopita et al. (2018), Table 2, for the corresponding dust
depletion factors of the other refractory elements. Actual
depletion factors in various ions for Fe, Ca, and Mg are
determined by comparing the model predicted line ﬂuxes
with those actually observed.

With the ram pressure ﬁxed, we then investigate the
behaviour of the L1-norm as a function of shock velocity
for the fast shock (which apart from the SMC SNR domi-
nates the total ﬂux). Apart from the overall behaviour of
the L1-norm, this shock velocity can also be constrained
by the excitation as measured by He I and He II lines.
In Figures 5 and 6 we show two examples of L1-norm
ﬁtting, and the He line ratio ﬁtting as a function of the
shock velocity. In most of these SNR, the shock velocity
in the fast shock is of order 200 km/s, with the He lines
indicating a slightly lower velocity than the global spec-
trum. The inferred shock velocities are fairly consistent
with the measured velocity dispersions (corrected for the
instrumental resolution) presented in Tables A1 to A3, a
result previously noted by Dopita et al. (2012).

3.3. Modelling Individual Objects
Given that, apart from a wide range in chemical
abundances, the pre-shock densities, evolutionary status
and the supernova type of these SNR diﬀer widely,
each present diﬀerent modelling challenges. Here we
summarise the main issues.

This remnant of the historical
Kepler’s SNR
supernova of SN 1604 was Type Ia (Baade 1943; Ya-
maguchi et al. 2014). Recently Sankrit et al. (2016)
have made a detailed proper-motion study of the blast
wave using Hubble Space Telescope images separated
by about 10 yr to establish a distance of 5.1+0.8
−0.7 kpc to
the remnant, which with Galactic coordinates G4.5+6.8
puts it almost directly towards the Galactic centre.

showed that these were very dense (ne ∼ 1000 cm−3),
which led to the suggestion that they represent shocked
circum-stellar material, rather than pristine samples of
the ISM. However, densities this high are encountered
in other SNR, notably in the LMC SNR N132D (Dopita
et al. 2018) and these are the consequence of the blast
wave encountering the dense self-gravitating clouds of
the ISM. We discuss this possibility further below.

Blast wave velocities of up to ∼ 3000 km/s were

of these, the so-called ejecta knot ﬁrst appeared only
around 1970 (van den Bergh & Kamper 1977). Given
their positions relative to the blast wave shell, the bright
regions observed here (the Box1 region of Sankrit et al.
(2016)) cannot be much older. We therefore model them
as ﬁnite-age shocks with radiative ages of ∼ 50 yr.

spectra between λλ7100 − 9000 are not observed. This
precludes a determination of either the C abundance
using the [C I] 8727˚A line, the Ar abundance using the
[Ar III] 7135˚A or 7751˚A lines, and the Cl abundance
using the [Cl II] 8579˚A line. Furthermore, the mea-
surement of the dust depletion factors is compromised
by the lack of a measurement of the IR lines of [Fe II],
[Ca II] and [Ni II].

SMC SNR 0104-72.3 This SNR is rather faint, and
our measurements are of an extensive region of some-
what enhanced density towards the eastern boundary of
the SNR centred at 01:06:24.0 -72:05:35 (J2000). This
region is dominated by the slow shock component, which
renders the determination of the fast shock parameters
more uncertain. The faster shocks are marked by the

(blue) [O III] emission in Figure 1. As can be seen this
emission tends to delineate the current position of the
blast wave.

NGC6822 Ho12 & IC1613 S8
In both of
these cases, we are determining the global spectrum
of the SNR. If there are variations in the local shock
conditions, which is certainly the case (Kong et al.
2004), these will be lost in the averaging process.

3.4. Fits to Observed Spectra
While the plot of the L1-norms is useful to summarise
the quality of the ﬁt, it is instructive to see how the in-
dividual line intensities predicted by the model ﬁt to the
observations. We show this in Table 2, which gives the
quality of the ﬁts to over 50 lines for those objects ob-

case a clear minimum is found, although this tends to be
shallower for the highest abundance objects. This is due
to “saturation” of the emission line intensities, as each of
the principal cooling ions compete for the limited amount
of enthalpy in the cooling zone in which they emit. How-
ever, it is clear that these SNR measurements constrain
the global O/H abundance to within ±0.1 dex.

In Table 3 we list the derived shock parameters – the
ram pressure driving the shocks, Pram, the velocity of the
fast shock, Vs, and the fraction of the Hβ ﬂux emitted
by the fast shock, F . In the case of Kepler’s SNR, the
shocks are of ﬁnite radiative age (see below). We also
give the estimated age of these in Table 3.

The derived chemical abundances and their estimated
errors are also given in the table. For O the errors can
be gauged from Figure 8. These are determined primar-
ily from the [O II] and [O III] ﬁtting. The predictions
of the models for the [O I] lines are less secure, since
these arise in a narrow region around the H recombi-
nation zone. As discussed above, our models tend to
systematically under-estimate the strength of the [O I]
lines while over-estimating the strength of the [N I] lines,
which arise in the same zone. The errors in determin-
ing the He and the O abundances are appreciably less
than for those of other elements, since most of these de-
pend on the measured ﬂux in a single line or doublet.
The derived abundances of N and S are of intermediate
accuracy, since these have good measurements of both
their blue and red lines. Estimating the errors in any
particular measurement of the elemental abundance is
diﬃcult, given the non-linear nature of the ﬁtting proce-
dure. However, a further indicator of the errors can be
derived from the scatter in the abundances derived from
the two regions in the Kepler’s SNR, and from the scatter
in the abundances derived for the three LMC SNRs.

4.2. Depletion Factors
The derived depletion factors for the refractory ele-
ments depend on what is assumed for the Ca, Mg, Fe and
Ni abundances. For these we use the Ca/O, Mg/O and
Fe/O scaling vs. O/H abundance, as given by Nicholls
et al. (2017). For Ni, we assume that the Ni/O ratio
scales as the Fe/O ratio.

All the models were run with a ﬁxed pattern of de-
pletions of the refractory elements from the gas onto
dust, using the Jenkins (2009) scaling relations for an
iron depletion factor of -0.5. This gives log DFe = −0.50,
log DCa = −0.36, log DMg = −0.00 and log DNi = −0.40.
The ratios of the observed to predicted line intensities
diﬀerent elements and ionisation stages were then com-
pared to derive the actual value of the depletion factor
required to best match the observations, resulting in the
derived depletion factors listed in Table 3.

Note that, in Table 2 we do not attempt to ﬁt the lines
of the higher excitation species of iron, such as [Fe X] and
[Fe XIV]. These species arise in the faster non-radiative
shocks located as bow shocks around the dense clouds
measured here, as was clearly demonstrated in Dopita
et al. (2016b, 2018) for the LMC SNRs, N49 and N132D.
Within the errors, the depletion factors derived for Ke-
pler’s SNR are zero, consistent with almost total de-
struction of the dust grains. This result is not in-
consistent with the IR IRAC and MIPS observations
by Blair et al. (2007). These authors found that the

served with the R = 3000 gratings. The ﬁts are depicted
graphically in Figure 7. Here, we have used the relative
strengths of lines in blends as predicted by the model
to disentangle the individual line ﬂuxes from Table A1 –
A3. We have corrected the line ﬂuxes given by the model
for [Fe II], [Fe III], [Fe VII], [Mg I], Ca II and [Ca II] using
the depletion factors derived in Table 3, below.

Overall the ﬁt to the models is excellent. The out-
standing issues apparent from Table 2 are as follows.
First, the models tend to over-estimate the strength of
the [N I] λλ5198, 5200 doublet, while under-estimating
the strength of the [O I] λλ6300, 6363 doublet. Sec-
ond, the models do not quite succeed in reproducing the
He I λ4471/Hβ and the He II/He I λλ4686/4471 ratios,
as can be seen in Figure 6. For ease of comparison, we
present the comparison of the modelled and observed line
ﬂuxes for all the ﬁtted lines in Figure 7.

The [N I] and [O I]

lines are formed in the cool,
partially-ionised region deep within the recombination
zone of the shock region which is particularly diﬃcult to
model. The predicted line strengths are strongly depen-
dent on the ionisation parameter of the local hard radi-
ation ﬁeld, which is in turn strongly dependent on the
detailed geometry of the recombination zone. This ge-
ometry also depends on the degree of thermally-unstable
cooling, which is capable of generating many local low-
velocity shocks with a complex recombination zone ge-
ometry (Sutherland et al. 2003). Such issues will also
aﬀect the predictions of the [C I] line and the derived
C abundance. However, it is hard to properly quantify
these errors. We have placed an extra ±0.15 dex error on
the C abundance to make allowance for this uncertainty.

cooling function, so in general this velocity will corre-
spond to the fastest radiative shock.

5.2. Kepler’s SNR
Returning to the question of whether the shocked
clouds in Kepler represent circum-stellar or true inter-
stellar matter, we note that the estimated 12 + log(O/H)
of these clouds is 9.06 ± 0.1.
If the diﬀerence be-
tween this and the Local Galactic value, 8.72, is solely
due to a galactic abundance gradient, then at a dis-
tance of 5.1+0.8
−0.7 kpc derived by Sankrit et al. (2016), the
Galactic Abundance gradient in O would be −0.059 ±
0.022 dex/kpc. This is in close agreement with that de-
termined by Rolleston et al. (2000) from 80 early B-type
stars, −0.067 ± 0.008 dex/kpc and with that found from
the study of H II regions as cited by Rolleston et al.
(2000).

An extensive review by Gillessen et al. (2013) con-
cludes that the most likely distance to the Galactic cen-
tre is 8.20 ± 0.35 kpc. Using this distance puts Ke-
pler’s SNR at a distance of ∼ 3.1 kpc from the Galac-
tic centre. From the work of Smartt et al. (2001) who
studied the abundances of stars within the inner 5 kpc
of the Galaxy, we expect 12 + log(O/H) = 9.0 ± 0.2,
12 + log(N/H) = 8.3 ± 0.2 at R = 3.1 kpc, while we mea-
sure Kepler’s SNR to have 12 + log(O/H) = 9.06 ± 0.10
and 12 + log(N/H) = 8.35 ± 0.10.

The high value of the derived C abundance ( 12 +
log(C/H) = 8.99 − 9.06) might also be taken as an in-
dication that the clouds in Kepler are of circum-stellar
origin. However, at high abundances, C behaves as a sec-
ondary nucleosynthesis element such that the C/O ratio
increases in proportion to the O abundance. The abun-
dance scaling given in Nicholls et al. (2017) suggests that,
at the O abundance measured in Kepler, we would expect
to see log(C/O) = −0.05 ± 0.10, which is entirely consis-
tent with the observed value. Thus we conclude that the
shocked clouds in Kepler’s SNR are truly of interstellar
composition, given their location within the Galaxy.

It is clear, however, that the Kepler clouds are not
representative of a diﬀuse component of the ISM, given
that the inferred pre-shock density of these clouds is
nH ∼ 600 cm−3. Such high densities are atypical at a
distance of ∼ 500 pc from the Galactic plane and are
also inconsistent with hydrodynamical simulations that
indicate a medium with some symmetry about the SN
site (Tsebrenko & Soker 2013).

It is more likely that the “Box 1” cloud complex of
Sankrit et al. (2016) represents a self-gravitating entity.
Using our measured pre-shock density and adopting a
diameter of ∼ 30 − 40 arc sec derived from the IR image
presented in Sankrit et al. (2016), we infer a cloud mass
of 1.4 − 3.5 M(cid:12). This value is comparable to the masses
derived by Dopita et al. (2018) for the shocked clouds in
the LMC supernova remnant N132D; 0.1 − 20 M(cid:12) with
a mean of ∼ 4 M(cid:12). These N132D clouds were inferred
to represent the cool ISM and to be typical ISM self-
gravitating Bonnor-Ebert spheres such as those recently
investigated on a theoretical basis by Sipil¨a et al. (2011,
2017) and Fischera (2014). The nature of the Kepler
clouds is probably similar.

Because the shocked clouds in Kepler appear to repre-
sent gravitationally-conﬁned samples of the ISM as they
existed before the supernova event, and because these

pressures and mixing ratio of the fast and slow shock components

galaxy are marked.

current mass of dust in the warm dust component is
5.4 × 10−4 M(cid:12), and they inferred an original dust mass
of about 3 × 10−3 M(cid:12) before grain sputtering. These
ﬁgures would imply log D ∼ −0.09, which is similar to
the [Fe II] and [Fe III] depletion factors derived here.
This high dust destruction degree is presumably related
to the high density in the pre-shock gas of the fast shock
(nH ∼ 600 cm−3).

For the remaining SNRs, which are all likely to result
from Type II SNe, −0.47 < log DFeII < −0.11, −0.80 <
log DFeIII < −0.36 and −1.11 < log DFeVII < −0.24.
This result is consistent with the conclusions of (Dopita
et al. 2016b) and (Dopita et al. 2018) that dust has been
mostly destroyed in the region emitting the [Fe II] lines,
while a smaller fraction has been destroyed in the Fe III
and Fe VII zones, consistent with the gyro-spinup grain
destruction models of Seab & Shull (1983) and Borkowski
& Dwek (1995).

5. DISCUSSION
5.1. Shock Velocities
From Table 3, it is apparent that we derive a fast shock
velocity in the range 200 − 230 km/s for all the observed
SNRs. This seems to be an extraordinarily narrow range
which demands some physical explanation.

It is certainly true that our models with either a sin-
gle or two shock velocities are an over-simpliﬁcation of
reality, and that a wider range in shock velocities must
be present. If we consider an ensemble of shocks driven
into a medium with variable density by a common driv-
ing pressure, P , then the shock luminosity L of a shock
with velocity v is given by L ∝ ρv3 or, equivalently,
L ∝ P v. Therefore the most luminous shock will be
the fastest fully radiative shock. At a shock velocity of
200 − 230 km/s, the plasma is heated to the peak of the

clouds are dense enough that they would not be appre-
ciably aﬀected in their chemical composition by any pre-
supernova mass-loss, they should therefore present ideal
samples of pristine ISM in the galactic regions close to
the Galactic Center.

5.3. Abundance Scaling Relations
5.3.1. Oxygen
In Table 4, we present the comparison of the de-
rived SNR O-abundances for these SNRs, and for stars
and H II regions. For the H II regions, we distinguish
determination made using the collisionally-excited lines
(CELs) and using recombination lines (RLs). In the case
of Kepler, we use the stellar abundances from Smartt
et al. (2001) and for the H II regions the data from Aﬄer-
bach et al. (1997). For consistency, the stellar and H II
region measurements of the remaining galaxies, we have
used the curated compilation of Bresolin et al. (2016) (for
the data sources they used see their Table 3).

Overall, the O abundances determined using SNRs
agree with the stellar abundance scale to 0.034 dex, the
H II region CEL abundance scale to 0.024 dex, and to
the mean of the stellar and H II regions to 0.034 dex. It
is clear that the RL abundance scale lies systematically
high relative to the other methods of determination. The
most likely cause of this oﬀset is ﬂuorescent excitation of
lines of Oxygen by the UV radiation ﬁeld of the central
stars, as quantiﬁed in the study of the planetary nebula
IC 418 by Morisset & Georgiev (2009). This object is rel-
evant to the study of H II regions since the central star
has a vey similar eﬀective temperature to the O-stars
which excite H II regions.

A second source of the discrepancy could be the exis-
tence of a κ−distribution in the electrons (Nicholls et al.
2012; Dopita et al. 2013). Recently, Livadiodis (2018) has
provided the theoretical underpinning of this hypothesis
by proving that the most general, physically meaningful,
distribution function that particle systems are stabilized
into when reaching thermal equilibrium is the kappa dis-
tribution family, of which the Maxwell-Boltzmann distri-
bution is a limiting case.

5.3.2. Nitrogen
In determining the interstellar medium (ISM) abun-
dances of galaxies from their H II regions, we are heavily
reliant on an accurate measurement of the N/O ratio,
since this ratio increases continuously with O/H as N
starts to behave as if it were a secondary nucleosynthetic
element. For example, one of the best abundance diag-
nostics is based upon the [N II]/[O II] ratio (Kewley &

Fig. 9.— 12 + log(O/H) vs. log(N/O) for our SNRs (black ﬁlled
circles), the Sun (black open circle), and the stellar and H II re-
gion determinations referenced in the text (green and blue circles).
The solid black curve is the best-ﬁt relation presented by Nicholls
et al. (2017) by adopting primary and secondary nucleosynthetic
components shown as dotted lines.

Dopita 2002). At high redshift the [O II]λλ3727, 3729
doublet is often unobservable, and calibrations based
upon the [N II]/Hα ratio (Denicol´o et al. 2002), the
[N II]/[O III] ratio (Pettini & Pagel 2004) or else using
the [N II], Hα and [S II] together (Dopita et al. 2016a)
are used instead.

In Figure 9 we compare our SNR results with other
works on the 12 + log(O/H) vs. log(N/O) diagram. Fol-
lowing Nicholls et al. (2017), we have drawn our data
from Spite et al. (2005) which refer to halo metal-poor
unmixed giants, Israelian et al. (2004) who made UV ob-
servations of unevolved metal-poor stars, Fabbian et al.
(2009) who measured halo solar-type dwarfs and sub-
giants,Nieva & Przybilla (2012) who observed local B
stars, and with nebular data collected from Blue Com-
pact Galaxies from Izotov & Thuan (1999). Clearly
the agreement between the SNR, H II region and stel-
lar measurements are within the errors, suggesting that
the 12 + log(O/H) vs. log(N/O) calibration in the Local
Universe is now well-determined.

5.3.3. Ne, Ar and Cl
Neon and Argon are both α−process elements (and
should therefore scale as Oxygen), and are noble gases
(and therefore suﬀer no depletion onto dust grains). Fol-
lowing Nicholls et al. (2017), in Figure 10 we plot the
measured ratio of these elements with respect to Oxygen
vs. 12 + log(O/H) from our SNRs, and from both stellar
and nebular sources taken from van Zee et al. (1998), Izo-
tov & Thuan (1999), van Zee & Haynes (2006) and Berg
et al. (2013). In addition, we plot the Cl/O ratio from
Milky Way H II regions (Esteban et al. 2015) and from
extra-galactic H II regions from Izotov & Thuan (2004)
and Izotov et al. (2006).

All three elements, Ne, Ar and Cl appear to scale lin-

Cipriano et al. (2017).

For the heavy elements found in refractory grains, we
must rely on stellar abundance determinations. The
mean of these abundances were adopted in our models.
Note that Peimbert (2003) gives the Fe abundance de-
termined from the nebular [Fe III] lines in 30 Doradus,
which are approximately 1.0 dex lower than the stellar
Fe abundances, implying a logarithmic depletion of iron
in the nebular gas of log DFe = −1.0. At this deple-
tion, and using the depletion factors for other elements
derived from the formulae of Jenkins (2009), we infer
log DC = −0.16 and log DO = −0.02. The ﬁgures given
in Table 5 for H II regions have been corrected for dust
using the gas-phase abundances given in the various pa-
pers cited above.

The mean abundances for the LMC are given in the
second column of Table 5. Given that the recombination
line determinations are probably aﬀected by resonant ex-
citation of the permitted lines of C and O by the UV light
of the exciting stars (as noted above), we have not used

oﬀset noted above for the Ar abundance derived from
SNRs, we have not included these in the averaging. The
errors are estimated from the total scatter between the
diﬀerent determinations, rather from the internal errors
given in the papers cited.

Given the improvement in the observations and their
method of analysis, the abundances given in Table 5
agree remarkably well with those derived by Russell &
Dopita (1992). All elements agree within the stated er-
rors, although the error bars in the current work are ap-
preciably smaller than those given in the earlier work.

5.4.2. Small Magellanic Cloud

For the SMC we use the data from Hunter et al. (2009)
for B Type stars, and Bouret et al. (2013) for O Type
Dwarf stars. For the H II regions, we use the work by
Toribio San Cipriano et al. (2017); Carlos Reyes et al.
(2015); Pe˜na-Guerrero et al. (2012); Rela˜no et al. (2002);
Peimbert et al. (2000); Testor (2001) and Kurt et al.
(1999). The data from the [Fe III] lines reported by
Rela˜no et al. (2002) compared with the Fe abundance de-
rived by Hunter et al. (2009) implies log DFe = −0.6. At
this depletion, we expect log DC = −0.06 and log DO =
−0.01. The H II region values given in Table 6 have been
corrected by this amount. Once again, the recombination
line abundances for the H II regions are systematically
high, and have not been used in the averaging.

6. CONCLUSIONS
Although the idea of measuring abundances and abun-
dance gradients in the ISM using radiative supernova
shockwaves is not new (Dopita 1977; Dopita et al. 1980),
the advances in instrumental capability, analysis and
shockwave modelling warrant a re-examination of this
technique. In this paper we have provided integral ﬁeld
spectroscopy and analysis based upon L1-norm minimi-
sation which establishes that the technique can pro-
vide chemical abundances with a precision comparable
to those given by the analysis of B-type stars, or from
the analysis of H II regions.

It is interesting that the fast shocks which generate the
majority of the line emission in the SNRs studied here all

early with O. For Ne, the scaling agrees very well with
that derived by Nieva & Przybilla (2012) while for Cl,
the scaling agrees very well with that determined by Es-
teban et al. (2015). A less good agreement is found for
the SNRs in the case of Ar, with the SNR points falling
systematically low by ∼ 0.2−0.3 dex relative to the solar,
H II region and stellar determinations. The most likely
explanation is that one or more of the Ar charge exchange
reactions is in error, leading to a truncated Ar III zone
in these shock models.

5.4. Elemental Abundances of the Magellanic Clouds
5.4.1. Large Magellanic Cloud
Given that the SNRs add another method of deter-
mining interstellar abundances, it is useful to compare
these with the recent stellar and H II region determi-
nations, given for the LMC in Table 5. Here we have
drawn data for the B-stars from Hunter et al. (2009);
Korn et al. (2002) and Korn et al. (2005). In addition
we use data from F-supergiants from Andrievsky et al.
(2001). For the H II regions we use the work of Pe-
imbert (2003); Carlos Reyes et al. (2015) and Toribio
San Cipriano et al. (2017) for abundances determined
from collisionally-excited lines, while for recombination
line abundances we use Peimbert (2003) and Toribio San

Rela˜no et al. (2002) Fe abundance in parenthesis is the measured gas-phase value.

have shock velocities in the range 200 − 230 km/s. We
have shown that the most luminous shock will be the
fastest fully radiative shock and at a shock velocity of
200 − 230 km/s, the plasma is heated to the peak of the
cooling function, so in general this velocity will corre-
spond to the fastest radiative shock. However, it should
also be noted that such shocks are marginally thermally-
unstable, so the plane-parallel steady-ﬂow models used
here become somewhat questionable. The eﬀect of ther-
mal instabilities in a 3-D geometry is to break up the
ﬂow, and to generate weak secondary shocks (Suther-
land et al. 2003) which may collectively signiﬁcantly con-
tribute to the overall emission. This may be the physical
reason that our model ﬁts were much improved by the
addition of a slow-shock component.

We have shown that the radiative knots in Kepler
are dense interstellar clouds which have been recently
shocked, rather than representing material ejected by the
pre-supernova star. The abundance gradient inferred for
our Galaxy is compatible with that found in B-type stars.
For the LMC and the SMC we have combined recent data
taken from all available techniques to provide new esti-
mates of the chemical abundances in these systems.

It seems clear that the abundances delivered by the re-
combination lines of C and O are systematically higher
than those give by other techniques, even when the de-

pletion of these elements onto dust grains is taken into
account. The most likely explanation is that the inten-
sity of these lines is enhanced by UV ﬂuorescent processes
driven by the UV radiation ﬁeld of the central stars.

For the refractory elements normally trapped in dust
grains, our results are generally consistent with the con-
clusions of (Dopita et al. 2016b) and (Dopita et al. 2018)
that dust has been mostly destroyed in the region emit-
ting the [Fe II] lines, while a smaller fraction has been de-
stroyed in the Fe III and Fe VII zones, consistent with the
models of Seab & Shull (1983) and Borkowski & Dwek
(1995). However, in Kepler, virtually all dust has been
destroyed. Dust destruction is also rather advanced in
IC 1613 S8.
