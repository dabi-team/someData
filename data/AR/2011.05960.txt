Abstract: We calculate coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections on
spin-0 nuclei (e.g. 40Ar and 28Si) at energies below 100 MeV within the Standard Model
and account for all eﬀects of permille size. We provide a complete error budget including
uncertainties at nuclear, nucleon, hadronic, and quark levels separately as well as pertur-
bative error. Our calculation starts from the four-fermion eﬀective ﬁeld theory to explicitly
separate heavy-particle mediated corrections (which are absorbed by Wilson coeﬃcients)
from light-particle contributions. Electrons and muons running in loops introduce a non-
trivial dependence on the momentum transfer due to their relatively light masses. These
same loops, and those mediated by tau leptons, break the ﬂavor universality because of
mass-dependent electromagnetic radiative corrections. Nuclear physics uncertainties signif-
icantly cancel in ﬂavor asymmetries resulting in subpercent relative errors. We ﬁnd that
for low neutrino energies, the cross section can be predicted with a relative precision that
is competitive with neutrino-electron scattering. We highlight potentially useful applica-
tions of such a precise cross section prediction ranging from precision tests of the Standard
Model, to searches for new physics and to the monitoring of nuclear reactors.

Introduction

Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering [1–3], or CEνNS for short, is the most recently
discovered form of neutrino interaction with matter [4]. In these interactions, the momen-
tum transferred to a system is suﬃciently low, such that the neutrino probes the nucleus
as a whole, instead of distinguishing individual nucleons. Compared to the usual neutrino-
nucleon interactions, the most important feature of CEνNS is what has been dubbed the
“coherent enhancement”: the cross section is proportional to the square of the weak charge
of the nucleus. This enhances the CEνNS interaction rate 10- to 100-fold, depending on
the nucleus in question relative to incoherent cross sections.

This new way of detecting neutrinos has attracted a great deal of attention from the
high-energy community. The possibility of doing neutrino physics with relatively small
detectors in the kg [5–9] to tonne [10–13] scale, as opposed to 100-tonne [14–17] or even
kiloton detectors [14, 15, 18], opens up the possibility of competitively measuring neutrino
properties with small-scale projects [6, 8, 19–21]. CEνNS provides an unavoidable back-
ground ﬂoor for dark matter direct detection [22–35]. Moreover, as CEνNS is inherently
a low-energy process, it provides a natural window to study light, weakly-coupled, new
physics in the neutrino sector [4, 33, 36–104]. Nevertheless, taking advantage of CEνNS to
do precision neutrino physics is not without its challenges.

Besides obvious experimental challenges, such as detecting low nuclear recoils, suppress-
ing backgrounds suﬃciently or reconstructing the incoming neutrino energy, capitalizing on
CEνNS requires overcoming certain theoretical diﬃculties.
In this manuscript, we deal
with a few of these. We present a calculation of radiative corrections that is universal
to all neutral-current processes that may aﬀect the CEνNS cross section at the few %
level. This is required to properly interpret future precision physics studies with CEνNS,
including weak mixing angle [20, 38, 63, 69, 70, 75, 76, 104–107] and neutrino charge ra-
dius [48, 69, 70, 75, 76, 108–111] extractions. We also calculate the ﬂavor-dependent correc-
tions to this process, which can change the CEνNS cross section at the few % level. These
ﬂavor-dependent contributions are particularly interesting because they allow a neutral-
current process to statistically distinguish the neutrino ﬂavor. While small, the ﬂavor
dependence of neutral-current scattering is thresholdless (being dictated by experimental
limits) and permits the detection of neutrino ﬂavor independent of the associated charged
lepton’s mass. Remarkably, this ﬂavor sensitivity implies that the tau neutrino can be ac-
cessed at neutrino energies of order 10 MeV, well below the tau production threshold in
neutrino-nucleon scattering of Eν
3.5 GeV. CEνNS oﬀers a realistic avenue with which
to observe these eﬀects since its cross section is much larger than other neutral-current
processes such as neutrino-electron scattering.

∼

As mentioned above, despite CEνNS being a neutral-current process, it receives elec-
tromagnetic radiative corrections which are naively of O(α/π
0.2%), however they can
be enhanced by kinematic factors resulting in percent-level corrections to tree-level results.
The era of precision CEνNS detectors, from the perspective of the Standard Model, is
therefore deﬁned by O(1%) precision commensurate with the optimistic projections for next-
generation detectors mentioned above, see e.g. the future physics goals outlined in [112].

data. Consequently, all dominant nuclear physics uncertainties are contained in the weak

Figure 1.
Radiative corrections induce a photon-mediated interaction with nuclei. Charged
currents (left diagram) lead to ﬂavor-dependent calculable corrections. Neutral currents (right
diagram) lead to ﬂavor-independent corrections, some of which involve light quarks and are in-
herently nonperturbative. Rather than working directly with the Standard Model Lagrangian, we
use a more eﬃcient four-fermion treatment [119–121] presented in section 2.1, that incorporates all
electroweak physics and eﬀects due to running coupling constants and heavy-particle loops inside
Wilson coeﬃcients.

In contrast to corrections from nuclear eﬀects (e.g. in the weak form factor), radiative
corrections introduce qualitatively new ingredients to CEνNS that are not present at leading
order. For example, CEνNS is often idealized as a ﬂavor-independent process, however
this is only true at tree level. Loops with charged leptons depend on the mass of the
lepton resulting in ﬂavor-dependent corrections (see ﬁg. 1). These eﬀects are reasonably
well appreciated in the CEνNS literature at a qualitative level [111, 122–126]. According
to [127, 128], neutrino-photon interactions are induced via loops of charged particles. As
for any spin-1/2 particle, the on-shell vertex can be parameterized using Dirac spinors and
p2)2 (see e.g. [129] for a review in the
form factors ¯u(p2)Γµ(Q2)u(p1) with Q2 =
−
context of neutrinos). Extracting the form factor slope from the experimental data, one can
probe a conventionally deﬁned neutrino charge radius [109]. While we agree that CEνNS is
a probe of the neutrino’s electromagnetic properties, it probes the Q2 dependence of form
factors rather than their Q2

0 limit.

For concreteness, most of our discussion focuses on neutrinos from a pion decay-at-rest
source. We comment on other sources of low-energy neutrinos when needed. Although
typical momentum transfers Q2
(30 MeV)2 are small relative to the scales relevant
for nuclear coherence, they are large relative to the scales controlling quantum ﬂuctuations,
namely me and mµ.
0 limit can only be taken safely for virtual τ
loops and for loops with µ over some kinematic range, as we will see later. More precisely,
the ﬂavor-dependent contribution is proportional to the vacuum polarization function in
QED, and depends on both Q2/m2
neither of which is small for e.g. a neutrino
and Q2/m2

corrections in this paper.

uncertainties at the same requisite O(1%) level of precision.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we introduce the relevant
theory for CEνNS scattering on spin-0 nuclei. In section 2.1, we begin with a discussion
of CEνNS kinematics and a discussion of nuclear form factors. We then describe the four-
Fermi eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT), as outlined in [121], that is used in the rest of the paper.
In sections 2.2 and 2.3, we make use of this EFT framework to give self-consistent deﬁnitions
of the nucleon and nuclear form factors including the weak nuclear charge. In section 2.4,
we provide a comprehensive error budget for the cross section.
In section 3, we focus
on the ﬂavor dependence and speciﬁcally the ﬂavor diﬀerence of cross sections, the ﬂavor
asymmetry, deﬁned as (cid:0)σν(cid:96) −
(cid:1) /σν(cid:96)
. In section 3.1, we discuss how the ﬂavor asymmetry
can be computed at NLO, i.e. O(G2
Fα2), with substantially reduced nuclear uncertainties
(see section 3.2). We then brieﬂy sketch possible useful applications of our results and
discuss the future of CEνNS in section 4. Finally, in section 5, we summarize our ﬁndings
and reiterate the applicability of our work to the future CEνNS program.

2 Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) on spin-0 nuclei

We focus here on spin-0 nuclei both because they are simple (our focus is on radiative
corrections rather than nuclear physics) and because at least two nuclear targets of spin-
0 are relevant to upcoming CEνNS detectors. Liquid argon is used as a common liquid
noble detector material all of whose stable isotopes (40Ar, 38Ar, and 36Ar) are spin-0, and
silicon is the main material in Skipper-CCDs [5, 19, 130, 131], two of whose stable isotopes
(28Si and 30Si) are spin-0 and compose 95% of silicon’s natural abundance. Moreover,
because a detailed understanding of 40Ar’s nuclear physics is essential for the DUNE physics
program [132, 133], we are optimistic that the theoretical nuclear uncertainties relevant for
CEνNS will be steadily improved in coming years.

At tree level, neutrino neutral-current scattering on spin-0 nuclei can be described by a
single form factor. At next-to-leading order (NLO) in the electromagnetic coupling constant
α, photon-mediated scattering takes place and the cross section inherits a ﬂavor-dependent

CEνNS is a low-energy process. To describe the cross sections at a percent level of
precision or better, it is important to properly account for the running of Lagrangian
parameters from the weak scale down to the scales relevant for CEνNS. In the Standard
Model (SM), this is a cumbersome task, and it is much more eﬃcient to work within the
four-fermion EFT when W, Z, and h are explicitly integrated out. This drastically reduces
the number of contributing Feynman diagrams, while allowing for a full and systematic
treatment of any loop-induced corrections from heavy particles.

Such an EFT approach has been worked out in detail by one of us in [121], and has
been successfully applied to neutrino-electron scattering in [119]. This latter process and
CEνNS share many similar features. In what follows, we introduce the EFT description
appropriate to low-energy neutral-current interactions (such as CEνNS or elastic νe scat-
tering). We summarize how heavy-quark and lepton contributions can be included pertur-
batively, whereas light-quark contributions require a nonperturbative treatment at CEνNS
kinematics. The nonperturbative corrections are ﬂavor independent, such that CEνNS ﬂa-
vor diﬀerences are not aﬀected by corresponding errors.

2.1 Four-fermion eﬀective ﬁeld theory and radiative corrections

Neutrino-photon interactions scale with the photon momentum as Q2 and can be captured
by a dimension-six operator ∂λF λρ ¯ν(cid:96)γρPLν(cid:96). Following [121], this interaction can be conve-
niently removed via a ﬁeld redeﬁnition (see appendix A for a detailed discussion), leading

here are evaluated in the MS renormalization scheme at a scale µ (cid:38) 2 GeV appropriate for
a quark-level description.
In this Lagrangian, the photon-neutrino couplings have been
removed explicitly by the ﬁeld redeﬁnition discussed above, and shuﬄed into the contact
interaction Wilson coeﬃcients. By doing this, any diagram involving photon exchange with
the nucleus that is mediated by heavy degrees of freedom (e.g. the top or bottom quark)
is shuﬄed into the left- and right-handed quark couplings. This explicitly decouples low-
and high-energy degrees of freedom, and results in a modiﬁed deﬁnition of the weak nuclear
form factor (see eq. (2.15)). Such eﬀects are proportional to the nuclear charge form factor
Fch(Q2).

The Wilson coeﬃcients in eq. (2.3) are calculated via a detailed matching performed
at the scale µ = MZ (the Higgs ﬁelds, top quark, W and Z gauge bosons are integrated
out at this step), and then evolved down to low energy scales via a renormalization group
analysis, decoupling quark ﬂavors (b) as they become heavy (see [121] for a comprehensive
description). By performing the matching at µ = MZ and running the couplings down to
µ = 2 GeV, loop corrections from all heavy particles in the SM are systematically included.
Four quarks u, d, s, and c, are treated as dynamical degrees of freedom. The eﬀects of u, d,
and s are encoded via a nonperturbative charge-charge and charge-isospin current-current
correlators, ˆΠ(3)
, whereas the c quark is included perturbatively. Charged leptons
are kept as propagating degrees of freedom and their inﬂuence on the left- and right-handed
couplings is included explicitly via a loop expansion. For heavy particles (tau leptons, the
charm quark, and hadronic loops), the momentum transfer is approximated as Q2 = 0. For
light leptons (e and µ), the full Q2 dependence is essential.

For mf = me (in particular) and Q = 1
50 MeV, there is no sense in which a small Q2
approximation is justiﬁed, and the full Q2 dependence must be retained. Tau leptons are
suﬃciently heavy that the Q2

0 limit can be taken safely for CEνNS kinematics.

We also include αs contributions to the charm-quark closed loop; for analytical ex-
pressions see [119, 143–146] and references therein. It is instructive to note that radiative
corrections of vector type do not change the axial part of the nucleon current (see sec-
tion 2.2). Consequently, all radiative corrections (besides the nuclear vertex correction) are
described by substitutions of eq. (2.4) for nuclei of arbitrary spin. The factorizable part
of the vertex correction and photon bremsstrahlung from the heavy nucleus can be safely
neglected.

For nuclei of nonzero spin, QED vertex corrections introduce higher electromagnetic
moments of order α. These corrections are beyond the scope of this work, but can be
included in the deﬁnition of electromagnetic response functions and can therefore be folded
into any empirical determination of nuclear form factors. All residual eﬀects scale as Q2/M 2
A
and are negligible for heavy nuclei. We therefore expect that the results of this paper can
be extended to higher spin nuclei in a relatively straightforward manner.

2.3 Weak and charge nuclear form factors in CEνNS

Form factors entering the cross section expressions can be deﬁned as the product of nucleon-
level form factors with point-proton and point-neutron distributions inside the nucleus
(cid:0)Q2(cid:1). Using the isospin-decomposed nucleon form factors of eqs. (2.9)

and (2.10) yields the following deﬁnition for the renormalization scale-dependent weak and

4The neglected relative diﬀerence in nucleon masses contributes a correction below permille level. Isospin-
breaking eﬀects are expected in constituent quark model to be at the similar level [147–150]. According
to ChPT-based calculation of [151], they can be much larger. This question requires a further theoretical
investigation on the lattice.

As discussed above, heavy physics mediated loops are included implicitly in the deﬁni-

certain electromagnetic corrections, such as those proportional to δQCD, could reasonably
be shuﬄed into the deﬁnition of the weak form factor. Our convention separates electro-

This illustrates that the deﬁnition of a weak nuclear charge is not unique at one-loop order
and beyond. Rather, these quantities depend on choice of convention, on the renormaliza-
tion scheme and on the process in general.

One should not compare directly the weak form factor and the weak charge in our
deﬁnition to commonly used values in parity-violating electron scattering (PVES) [137].
The Wilson coeﬃcients that will be embedded inside nucleons are process dependent, i.e.

5The normalization of form factors fp and fn is ﬁxed by the number of protons (Z) and neutrons (N )

inside the nucleus as fp (0) = Z and fn (0) = N .

6At leading order, the weak charge of the nucleus is given approximately by the number of neutrons N

taken with opposite sign.

electron-quark and neutrino-quark couplings diﬀer after accounting for heavy-physics medi-
ated one-loop corrections. Moreover, one-loop radiative corrections depend on the process
even within the low-energy eﬀective theory. For example, in PVES electrons can exchange
a photon with the nucleus leading to a γ
Z box diagram at NLO. This cannot occur in
CEνNS because neutrinos do not couple directly to photons. A comparison of the weak
nuclear charge deﬁned in this work to conventions in the PVES literature will require a
proper account for one-loop running of electron-quark Wilson coeﬃcients from the elec-
troweak scale down to µ = 2 GeV and reliable treatment of radiative corrections in PVES.
[121], QCD and uncertain hadronic contributions cancel
in ﬂavor diﬀerences of charges in eqs. (2.19) and (2.20). One can precisely predict these

This provides a microscopic deﬁnition of nuclear form factors in terms of the Wilson
coeﬃcients in the four-fermion Lagrangian presented above, assuming a conventional picture
of nuclear physics. Trusting such a microscopic picture relies on a top-down approach to
nuclear physics, and one may worry that complicated eﬀects related to such a many-body
strongly interacting system are not well understood. One famous example is the EMC
eﬀect [167–169], where quark parton distribution functions inside nuclei were found to
diﬀer from those of nucleons in a vacuum. This eﬀect is still not understood. Nevertheless,
at momentum transfers of O(50 MeV) and below, one does not expect these eﬀects to be
important.

An alternative to this is the bottom-up approach based on the extraction of relevant
form factors, Fch(Q2) and FW(Q2), directly from experiments. In fact, Fch(Q2) is already
well determined with high precision for a number of nuclei [170, 171], including 40Ar [172],
through decades of elastic electron scattering experiments. For instance, the charge radius
of 208Pb extracted from experiment is known to about 0.02% precision [170]. Similarly,
FW(Q2) can be experimentally determined in a clean model-independent way from elec-
troweak probes such as CEνNS and PVES experiments [173].

A precise measurement of CEνNS cross section on a particular nucleus can be used
to extract FW(Q2) of that nucleus, using eq. (2.2). Note however that, while δν(cid:96) can be
calculated and Fch(Q2) can be measured with electron-nucleus scattering, the precision on
the determination of FW(Q2) will be limited by hadronic uncertainties stemming from δQCD.

7Our ﬂavor diﬀerences are in agreement with [165, 166] while central values for weak charges diﬀer due

to distinct matching and treatment of hadronic contributions in [165, 166] vs [121].

The latter nonperturbative object can be in principle constrained by lattice calculations or
performing measurements on nuclei with diﬀerent numbers of protons and neutrons, Z and
N respectively. Another possible way of measuring the weak form factor of the nucleus is
via PVES experiments, albeit subject to the diﬃculties outlined above relating to process-
dependent shifts in Wilson coeﬃcients and radiative corrections. To convey the basic idea,
we ignore these subtleties and work at leading order in the following discussion. The key
experimental observable in the elastic scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons from
the unpolarized spin-0 nucleus is the parity-violating asymmetry APV. The parity-violating
asymmetry arises from the interference of γ-mediated and Z-mediated scattering diagrams.
The asymmetry APV is determined from the fractional diﬀerence in cross sections between
the scattering of positive and negative helicity electrons, that is, APV = (σ+
σ−)/(σ++σ−),
where
refers to the polarization of the electron. This is similar to the parity violation
asymmetry in Möller scattering experiments. In the Born approximation at low momentum
transfer, APV is proportional to the ratio of the weak to the charge form factors of the
nucleus:8

where form factors are normalized to the nucleus’ weak and electric charges, that is, QW

FW(Q2 = 0) and Z
from elastic electron scattering experiment, one can extract FW(Q2) from measured APV
in eq. (2.24) at the momentum transfer of the experiment after accounting for radiative
corrections and Coulomb distortion eﬀects not considered in the Born approximation [174].
Coulomb distortions can be theoretically calculated by solving the Dirac equation for an
electron moving in a nuclear potential [175–179] and are relatively well understood [180].

In fact, the PREX experiment at JLab has done such measurement and provided

cision of the 208Pb form factor measured by PREX. The CREX experiment is planned to
measure the weak form factor of 48Ca [182]. Future facilities such as the MESA facility in
Mainz envisioned to start operations in a few years will also be suited for high-precision
parity-violating experiments [183].

It is worth noting that CEνNS can be used to probe the weak form factor only at
low momentum transfers where the process remains coherent, but accesses a continuum
of four-momentum transfers. In contrast, PVES experiments are usually carried out at a
single value of the momentum transfer at a time. A combination of measurements from
these two independent and complementary scattering techniques is ideal since systematic
uncertainties are largely uncorrelated. This will then provide an empirical extraction of a
nucleus’ weak form factor in clean and model-independent fashion.

8PVES is sensitive to Wilson coeﬃcients of electron-quark interaction and is subject to radiative correc-

tions distinct to the CEνNS process.

2.4 Cross sections and uncertainties for a monoenergetic source

In this section, we evaluate CEνNS cross sections and provide a complete error budget for
the case of 40Ar nucleus.9 We focus on three benchmark energies relevant for a CEνNS ex-
periment whose neutrino ﬂux is sourced by pion decay at rest (πDAR). We take Eν = 10, 30,
and 50 MeV. A proper treatment of ﬂux-averaged cross sections in a realistic experimental
setup would require a precise prediction of the daughter neutrinos from both pion and muon
decay. This necessarily involves an understanding of decay in ﬂight (DIF) contamination
and a more precise theoretical prediction of both the pion’s and muon’s decay spectrum
including radiative corrections; both eﬀects need to be understood at the percent or even
permille level. The former issue is experiment speciﬁc and must be addressed with Monte
Carlo simulations, while the latter is an interesting and important theoretical problem that
we leave to future work. We discuss some of these issues qualitatively in appendix C.

In what follows, we provide an estimated error budget accounting for uncertainties
stemming from a variety of sources. Our treatment is meant to be conservative and ex-
haustive. We include the following sources of uncertainties:

• Nuclear level: For the central values, we average over eight available nuclear cal-
culations for fp and fn [117, 118, 187, 188]. At small momentum transfer, we es-
timate the theoretical uncertainty using the small Q2 expansion in terms of point-
0.046 fm [170, 188, 189],10 i.e.
nucleon radii Rp = 3.338
n/6(cid:1), as the error propagated from point-
fp = Z (cid:0)1
proton and point-neutron radii added in quadrature to the error of next terms in the
σ(Rp, Rn = 0)]2 /σ(Rp, Rn). At larger mo-
Q2 expansion estimated as [σ(Rp, Rn)
mentum transfer, we take the largest diﬀerence between the theoretical calculations
of [117, 118, 187, 188, 190]. At intermediate region, we take the minimum of these
two estimates.

0.03) respectively. This modiﬁed error estimate increases the error of the ﬂavor asymmetry in table 3 at
energy Eν = 50 MeV by the last signiﬁcant digit, while the total error in table 3 at energy Eν = 30 MeV
increases as 0.35 → 0.40.

• Wilson coeﬃcients: We propagate central values and uncertainties of neutrino-

threshold matching errors.

• Perturbative expansion: We estimate the perturbative error as a diﬀerence be-
tween our results evaluated at scales µ = √2µ0 and µ = µ0/√2 with µ0 = 2 GeV.

To estimate the total uncertainty, we add all of the above errors in quadrature. We present
the relative size of uncertainties of total cross section in table 2 and for the diﬀerential
cross sections in ﬁg. 3. For convenience, we also provide the CEνNS cross sections for the

As we can see from table 2, at higher energies the main source of uncertainty for the
CEνNS cross section comes from nuclear physics. In fact, this can be traced down to the
error of the neutron distribution inside the nucleus. The error stemming from the charge-
isospin hadronic correlator, ˆΠ(3)
, is the second largest source of uncertainty for Eν (cid:38) 30
3γ
MeV, and actually dominates over the neutron distribution error at low energies. This
is because the point-neutron and point-proton form factors are normalized up to inﬁnite

precision at Q2
0 while deviations scale as Q2. Thus, much like in neutrino-electron
scattering [119], the charge-isospin correlator is the major theoretical bottleneck for precise
predictions. Fortunately, however, our knowledge of this object can be improved with future
lattice QCD studies [191–193], and since it’s contribution is α/π suppressed for neutrino
neutral-current scattering, an uncertainty on the order of 5% would reduce its contribution
to the error budget to the permille level. This would be below the precision necessary for
next-generation CEνNS experiments to achieve their goals. The third largest source of the
error is the uncertainty of neutrino-quark couplings from [121].

One interesting consequence of our calculations is that the dominant source of uncer-
tainty at low momentum transfers Q2 (cid:46) 100 MeV2 is given by microscopic particle physics
inputs rather than nuclear modeling. The reason for this is that the point-like treatment
of the nucleus becomes such a good approximation at low energies that all nuclear model-
ing details are subdominant to hadronic uncertainties. This motivates using CEνNS as a
precision observable at low neutrino energies as we discuss in section 4.3.

3 Flavor-dependent cross section diﬀerences

As emphasized above, radiative corrections in CEνNS can be split into a ﬂavor-independent
and ﬂavor-dependent parts, the latter being induced by charged-lepton loops. Noting that
proton and charge form factors induce a negligible uncertainty, and that hadronic and
neutron-related uncertainties are ﬂavor universal, one can give a precise description of
ﬂavor-dependent eﬀects.

This simple observation means that the ﬂavor diﬀerence can be calculated precisely at
Fα) subject only to uncertainties related to FW(Q2). The ﬂavor diﬀerence is expressed

O(G2

3.2 Uncertainties for a monoenergetic source

In this section, we focus on the ﬂavor asymmetry deﬁned in eq. (3.3) which can be reliably
computed to next-to-leading order. Moreover, the relative error for the ﬂavor asymmetry
is actually lower than the relative uncertainty of the total cross section as can be seen by
comparing table 2 vs tables 3 and 4.

The reason for the lessened uncertainty can be understood as follows. Most of the
nuclear uncertainties cancel in the ratio drastically decreasing the relative uncertainty at
higher energies of O(50 MeV). The hadronic contribution cancels in the numerator, and only
enters at next-to-leading order because of its’ entering the cross section in the denominator.
The same holds true for the quark couplings error.

The motivation for the precise calculation performed here is the rapid progress in technology
for CEνNS detector. In the three years since its discovery, the ﬁeld of CEνNS research has
blown up and we optimistically await improved detector technologies and larger exposures
that will drive down systematical and statistical uncertainties. With this outlook in mind,
we brieﬂy outline some potentially interesting applications of the work presented here that
we hope will motivate and inform future experiments.

4.1 Precision electroweak observables at low energy

To test the Standard Model of particle physics at low energies, our precise predictions of
cross sections with quantiﬁed uncertainties [119, 121] can be directly compared to experi-
mental measurements. Any signiﬁcant deviations between the theory and experiment will
indicate the presence of new physics and can be expressed as some conventional deﬁnition
for the low-energy property, traditionally referred to the Weinberg angle or the neutrino
charge radius. More generally, what can be probed is the weak form factor of a nucleus
and the neutrino’s electromagnetic form factor. Recent work has considered CEνNS as a
percent-level probe of physics both within [20, 38, 48, 63, 69, 70, 75, 76, 105–111] and be-
yond the Standard Model (BSM) [4, 19, 33, 36–42, 46–51, 53–101]. Our precise theoretical
treatment will allow us to consistently account for theoretical errors putting constraints
on standard and non-standard neutrino couplings either on more speciﬁc parameters or
concrete BSM scenarios.

We would like to stress that any analysis of low-energy properties at percent level or
better has to be supplemented with a complete treatment of electroweak and QCD virtual
corrections, at least at one-loop level. In particular, neutrino-electron scattering at energies
of accelerator neutrinos and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering require a complete
account for the kinematic dependence of radiative corrections which is often overlooked in
the literature.

Working with correct (i.e. physical and propagating) degrees of freedom at low ener-
gies is the other crucial physical feature that is typically not taken into account. Quarks
are not valid degrees of freedom at and below the QCD scale ΛQCD. One has to switch
to the hadronic description which introduces additional uncertainty in any neutral-current
neutrino-induced process due to the pure knowledge of the charge-isospin current-current
correlation function ˆΠ3γ. The knowledge of ˆΠ3γ at low energies can be improved by a fac-
tor 5-10 with precise lattice QCD studies [191–193]. We would like to stress that hadronic
physics introduces an error at a few permille level that is universal to all neutrino-induced
neutral-current scattering. Going to low energies where nuclear physics is under control,
these universal uncertainties dominate the error budget for both CEνNS and neutrino-
electron scattering. Therefore, we conclude that CEνNS is actually an ideal tool for preci-
sion tests of electroweak physics due to the relative ease with which high statistics samples
can be obtained (since the CEνNS cross section is much larger than the νe cross section).
In ﬁg. 6, to illustrate how much larger the CEνNS cross section is, we compare the CEνeNS
cross section on 40Ar with neutrino-electron cross sections of [119] multiplied by the factor

– 18 –

Z = 18. The main drawbacks for performing precision physics with CEνNS are experimen-
tal uncertainties such as quenching factor and background rejection and the uncertainty on
the neutrino ﬂux. While we expect future experiments to mitigate the former, the latter is
an issue shared by almost all neutrino sources.

Figure 6. On the upper plot, CEνeNS cross section on 40Ar (blue band) is compared to νee and
¯νee cross sections of [119] multiplied by the factor Z = 18. On the lower plot, the relative error of
the total CEνeNS cross section is presented.

4.2 Prompt to delayed ratios with decay-at-rest sources

One particularly interesting application of our results involves the prompt to delayed ratio
that is often considered at πDAR experiments. At COHERENT, for example, the ﬁnite
time required for a beam spill limits the eﬃciency of a timing cut to being O(10%) [194],
however this is a well-studied eﬀect, and it is reasonable to expect the collaboration to
understand the precision of this eﬃciency at the percent level. Such a timing cut generates
two samples of events: prompt and delayed, the former being composed of O(90%) νµ and
O(10%) ¯νµ, νe and vice-versa for the latter. As we have demonstrated above, the νe and νµ
CEνNS cross sections diﬀer at the level of a few percent, and the two event samples would
therefore be expected to yield event rates that also diﬀer from the naive 1:2 event ratio
at the percent level. Since ratios of prompt to delayed ﬂuxes are a standard “handle” for
πDAR data, understanding this eﬀect in detail for a given experiment’s timing eﬃciency is
an important issue to address.

(NSIs) [59, 75, 77, 81, 84, 89, 97] and sterile neutrino oscillations [63, 195]. As described
above, timing cuts allow one to probe the ﬂavor structure of a πDAR source, and ﬂavor-
dependent NSIs are easily capable of explaining any asymmetry between the prompt and
delayed samples. If similar studies are to be conducted with percent level precision at future
experiments then proper accounting for the SM ﬂavor asymmetry is once again mandatory.
Finally, in addition to ﬂavor-dependent corrections, the simple observation that the
cross section is shifted relative to its SM predicted value is important for experiments with
πDAR, nuclear reactor neutrino sources, and isotope decay-at-rest sources (IsoDAR) [196].
We will discuss the latter in the next section. A precise knowledge of the CEνNS cross
section could be coupled with an IsoDAR or πDAR source to provide high-precision cal-
ibrations of quenching factors [197–200] which could then be used in applications with
CEνNS detectors at nuclear reactor sources where ﬂux uncertainties are more severe, as we
will see shortly.

4.3

Isotope decay at rest

As alluded to at the end of section 2.4, the theoretical uncertainty of the CEνNS cross
section is incredibly small at low recoil energies being dominated by hadronic current-
current correlators and uncertainty on quark-level couplings in the eﬀective ﬁeld theory
description used here. Moreover, CEνNS is easily the largest neutrino cross section available
at low energies, surpassing both inverse beta decay and neutrino-electron scattering, and,
as we have emphasized in this work, is even sensitive to ﬂavor diﬀerences at the percent
10 MeV) neutrinos to exist,
level. Therefore, were a high-intensity source of low-energy (
CEνNS would represent a powerful tool with which to conduct precision experiments. One
would have both large statistics and high-precision predictions.

∼

Such a low-energy neutrino source has been recently proposed as part of the DAEδALUS
facility [201] being termed isotope decay at rest (IsoDAR) [196]. The basic premise is to
irradiate a beryllium target, liberating neutrons, which are subsequently captured in a
surrounding isotopically (99.9%) pure 7Li sleeve. Neutron capture in the absorber leads to
a large population of radioactive 8Li which then beta decays yielding a low-energy ¯νe. The
beta decay of 8Li has a relatively well-understood decay spectrum and an ongoing program
of Monte Carlo studies are underway [202] to have an accurate prediction for the ¯νe ﬂux.
The produced ¯νe ﬂux can then be detected via either elastic scattering or inverse beta
decay (IBD)11 ¯νep
ne+. A high-intensity IsoDAR source has many of the same ad-
vantages of a nuclear reactor source, without the complicated problem of uncertain and
time-dependent fuel composition. The energy is suﬃciently high that IBD thresholds are
easily overcome. Because the energy of the signal e+ from IBD is highly correlated with an-
tineutrino energy, many IsoDAR studies focus on its ability to yield a large ﬂux of neutrinos
with measurable energy.

→

Other complementary detector strategies for IsoDAR have also been proposed including
CEνNS and elastic neutrino-electron scattering. The latter of these two channels has a very

small cross section, but is often touted as a perfect setting in which to perform precision
tests of the Standard Model at low energies [203, 204]. While electrons are naively a
perfectly “clean” target, as we discuss in section 4.1 at O(G2
Fα), the same charge-isospin
hadronic correlator, introduced in eq. (2.6), enters the radiative corrections and dominates
the theoretical uncertainty of the cross section.
In [203], both a CEνNS detector and
a νe scattering detector were proposed on the merits of observing nuclear coherence and
conducting precision electroweak measurements respectively. At IsoDAR energies, however,
we ﬁnd that the SM prediction for the CEνNS cross section is competitive with the relative
precision of the νe scattering cross section, but would allow for a much larger statistical
sample. We therefore conclude that a CEνNS detector could perform both tasks at an
IsoDAR source.

4.4 Standard oscillations

As ﬂavor corrections lead to slightly diﬀerent CEνNS cross sections for each neutrino ﬂavor,
it raises the following question: “Can oscillation physics be studied with CEνNS”? The main
advantage here compared to other neutrino oscillation experiment is that CEνNS has no
particle production threshold. Therefore, one may study tau neutrino physics well below the
tau production threshold of about 3.5 GeV. For example, with a πDAR source the maximum
of tau appearance would require about 15 km baseline. In fact, exploring CEνNS to study
tau neutrinos would be the only way currently known to study ντ (¯ντ ) oscillations with
(statistical) ﬂavor identiﬁcation below the tau threshold.

Another advantage would be related to the size of the detector necessary to study neu-
trino oscillations. First, the large CEνNS cross section would allow for smaller detectors to
see a relatively large number of events. Second, the shorter baseline to observe oscillations,
compared to e.g. 810 km and 295 km of the current oscillation experiments NOvA [205]
and T2K [206], would also help getting more events. The obvious disadvantage lies in the
fact that the ﬂavor-dependent eﬀects in CEνNS are at a few percent level, and thus the
changes in event counts induced by oscillations are typically small.

To have an idea of what could be done, in principle, with a CEνNS detector for standard
oscillation physics, we have performed the following simple exercise. To estimate the statis-
tical precision one may achieve in such a setup, we have (very optimistically) assumed that a
total liquid argon detector and πDAR source such that (total number of pions produced)
×
(detector ﬁducial mass) = 20NA kton, where NA is the Avogadro number. If the detector
is deployed 15 km from the source, the prompt monochromatic line would lead to about
10,000 CEνNS interactions while the delayed continuous spectrum would lead to 30,000
events. This translates into 1% and 0.6% statistical uncertainties. The relative diﬀerence
in the number of events between unoscillated and oscillated neutrino ﬂuxes would be 1.3%
and 0.6% for the prompt and delayed neutrinos, assuming the best ﬁt oscillation parameters
of [207] and using the ﬂavor-dependent CEνNS cross section of eq. (3.5).

To obtain some understanding of these numbers, we ﬁrst note that the prompt ﬂux
of νµ almost entirely oscillates to ντ at 15 km. While a similar oscillation eﬀect happens
to the delayed ¯νµ component, νe disappearance is driven by the smallest mixing angle
0.09. Therefore, the oscillation eﬀect on the delayed component is about half
sin2 2θ13

of that in the prompt events, modulus the energy dependence of the delayed ﬂux and
Q2 dependence on asymmetries involving the electron ﬂavor. Also, contributions to the
asymmetry by νµ

νe oscillations have the opposite sign.

ντ and νµ

From these numbers, one could, within the proposed optimistic scenario, measure tau
appearance below the tau threshold at the couple of σ level. Note also that, while a near
detector would certainly be helpful, the ratio between prompt and delayed spectrum could
mitigate the uncertainties on the initial neutrino ﬂux.

→

→

Doing precision oscillation physics with such a setup would be quite a challenge: per-
cent level sensitivity to e.g. sin2 2θ23 would require at least a statistical uncertainty of a
few %, which seems a bit too optimistic (that is, unrealistic) for next, or even next-to-next
generation experiments. Nevertheless, studying tau neutrinos with this setup could provide
nontrivial information on the unitarity of the PMNS matrix [208–212]. As a ﬁnal remark,
future dark matter direct detection experiments like DARWIN [213] will be able to observe
CEνNS from the 8B solar neutrino ﬂux. The expected number of CEνNS events from this
ﬂux above the threshold is about 90 events per ton-year [214] which would translate into
36,000 events for a 40 ton dual-phase xenon detector running for 10 years. The number
of events could be increased if the nuclear recoil detection threshold is lowered, possibly
allowing for oscillation studies at DARWIN with CEνNS. To understand if a realistic exper-
imental setup could leverage the ﬂavor dependence of the CEνNS cross section to perform
oscillation physics studies is beyond the scope of this paper and may be pursued in the
future.

4.5 Oscillations to sterile neutrinos

The LSND [215] and MiniBooNE [216] anomalies present an outstanding conundrum in the
ﬁeld of neutrino physics. While these anomalies are consistent with the existence of light
sterile neutrinos at the eV, such an interpretation presents severe tension with numerous
experiments [217–220] and with standard ΛCDM cosmology [221–224]. The sterile neutrino
searches in most oscillation experiments primarily rely on charged-current interactions using
either an appearance signal, interpreted as an active ﬂavor oscillating to another active
ﬂavor, or a disappearance signal, interpreted as an active ﬂavor oscillating to any other
neutrino ﬂavor (active or sterile).

Oscillation probabilities are simplest for monoenergetic sources and πDAR provides a
high-intensity monoenergetic source of νµ, thus being a natural candidate for carrying out
high statistics searches for νµ disappearance. Importantly, however, the daughter neutrino
from πDAR is well below the charged-current threshold required to produce muons, and so
one must rely on neutral-current processes. In this context, CEνNS has been recognized as
being advantageous due to its relatively large cross section [42, 101, 225, 226]. Working at
lower energies allows for shorter baselines with equivalent L/Eν and consequently higher
ﬂuxes as compared to e.g. the SBN program.

Regarding the experimental landscape, currently a 10-ton liquid argon experiment,
Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) at Lujan center at LANL, is operational and plans to
study active-to-sterile neutrino oscillations using CEνNS [13] at multiple baselines from
the πDAR source. Future measurements with ton and multi-ton scale CEνNS detector at

– 22 –

the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL [227] and at the European Spallation Source [75]
are at planning stage. A key assumption in all of these proposals, however, is that CEνNS is
ﬂavor independent. As we have shown in this work, CEνNS has a precisely calculable de-
pendence on neutrino ﬂavor that enters at a few percent level and is especially pronounced
at low nuclear recoil energies. If CCM or similar experiments are to search for disappear-
ance probabilities on the order of a few percent, these SM radiative corrections become
obligatory for a proper analysis. Even with a near detector, ﬂavor-dependent corrections
to the CEνNS cross section are required to properly interpret precise experimental results.

4.6 Nuclear facility monitoring

Recent work has shown that neutrino detectors, both using IBD (i.e. ¯νe capture on free
protons) and CEνNS on nuclei, can serve as novel state of the art instruments for monitoring
nuclear facilities (see [228] for a review). This includes both civilian nuclear reactors, where
precise measurements of the ¯νe ﬂux can provide information about spent fuel [229, 230], and
the global excess of ﬁssile nuclear materials [231, 232]. These ideas have already motivated
the construction of one such neutrino-based nuclear reactor monitoring system [233].

In both cases, CEνNS occupies a unique and complementary position relative to IBD
because of its thresholdless nature [232, 234]. There are two ways in which CEνNS dif-
ferentiates itself from IBD. First, the cross section is much larger. This observation holds
true even after normalizing per unit of detector mass [234] provided the thresholds are low
enough (sub 100 eV). Perhaps more important, however, is the fact that certain neutrino
ﬂux components appear only below the IBD threshold, Eν (cid:46) 1.8 MeV, and so CEνNS is the
only tool available for certain applications. A notable example is the monitoring plutonium
blankets [232] as a marker of compliance with the Plutonium Management and Disposition
Agreement.12 Interestingly, it is in this low-energy, low-nuclear recoil limit where radiative
corrections are most sizeable as can be clearly seen by comparing the three panels of ﬁg. 3.
Moreover, (anti)neutrinos emitted in nuclear reactions are electron ﬂavor eigenstates for
whom radiative corrections are the largest (relative to muon and tau neutrino ﬂavors).

Neutrino energies substantially below the IBD threshold may be accessible in the fu-
ture by employing silicon-based Skipper-CCDs, which have recoil thresholds in the 10-20
eV range. The most abundant isotope of silicon, 28Si, composes over 90% of a naturally
occurring silicon source and is, fortuitously, a spin-0 nucleus. The other two stable isotopes,
29Si and 30Si, are spin-1/2 and spin-0 and have natural abundances of 5% and 3% respec-
tively. Although beyond the scope of this work, the eﬀective ﬁeld theory treatment can be
extended to spin-1/2 nuclei.

The level of precision achieved here paves the way for high-precision neutrino detection
of nuclear facilities. Having provided a permille level error budget for the CEνNS cross
section, we essentially guarantee that near-future neutrino probes of nuclear reactors will be
limited by either statistics or experimental systematics. CEνNS naturally complements IBD

because of its thresholdless nature allowing detectors to measure components of the neutrino
ﬂux with Eν (cid:46) 1.8 MeV below IBD thresholds. Some of these low-energy components are
essential for applications [232]. To measure low-energy neutrinos necessarily requires a low
nuclear recoil threshold, and it is interesting to note that the radiative corrections studied
in this work are largest in the low-recoil limit. We hope that the ability to conduct future
precision measurements of ¯νe spectra uninhibited by theoretical errors will serve as a useful
tool in the monitoring of civilian and military nuclear facilities.

5 Conclusions and outlook

We have provided a comprehensive treatment of CEνNS cross sections on spin-0 nuclei
appropriate for next-to-leading order accuracy of both the overall ﬂavor-dependent cross
section and ﬂavor asymmetries. Our calculation accounts for all sources of theoretical errors
including nuclear form factors, nucleon form factors, perturbative error in the determination
of low-energy Wilson coeﬃcients, and nonperturbative hadronic contributions to radiative
corrections. Extension to higher spin nuclei is possible after a careful account for nuclear
responses.

Surprisingly, the largest source of uncertainty at low energies comes from hadronic
physics and perturbative error in the determination of Wilson coeﬃcients. At larger ener-
gies, nuclear form factor uncertainties associated with the distribution of neutrons dominate.
Practically speaking, this means that the CEνNS cross section for low-energy neutrinos is
a precision observable on par with neutrino-electron scattering whose dominant theoretical
uncertainty is driven by the same hadronic charge-isospin correlator as the CEνNS cross
section.

Our results pave the way for future high-precision CEνNS experiments. While technical
hurdles must still be overcome to begin probing percent-level eﬀects and to reach enhanced
low-recoil cross sections, once these have been achieved CEνNS will be able to test SM
prediction of neutrino interactions and to search for new physics that leads to percent
level (or optimistically permille level) deviations from SM predictions. We think that a
CEνNS detector coupled with an IsoDAR source is especially promising. However, a πDAR
source could provide similarly high levels of precision provided the nuclear uncertainties that
enter at higher neutrino energies are reduced to a permille level.

In summary, we have provided a state of the art precision calculation of the CEνNS cross
section and ﬂavor asymmetries that we hope will enable and motivate future experimental
progress.

A Field redeﬁnition for the eﬀective Lagrangian

In this paper, we have emphasized the role of the photon in CEνNS but our eﬀective
Lagrangian does not contain any explicit neutrino-photon coupling. As discussed in the
main text, the absence of an explicit photon-neutrino coupling is a consequence of ﬁeld
redeﬁnition which induces an explicit vector-like (weak-electromagnetic) current-current
interaction between neutrinos and the nucleus. In this section, we oﬀer a brief discussion
of this ﬁeld redeﬁnition; for a detailed discussion see [121].

Prior to the ﬁeld redeﬁnition, the neutral-current interaction of neutrinos with quarks
Fα) is described by the eﬀective

and leptons relevant for scattering cross sections at O(G2
four-fermion Lagrangian [121, 235] (neglecting fermion kinetic terms)

The fact that neutrino-photon coupling only appears at dimension-6 is a manifestation of the
anapole-only neutrino-photon vertex appropriate for a massless (or massive and Majorana)
neutrino [129].

For neutral-current scattering applications, it is convenient to redeﬁne the photon ﬁeld13
such that neutrino-photon interactions are removed at NLO. The appropriate ﬁeld redeﬁ-
nition to achieve this feature is

B Comparison with eﬀective Weinberg angle convention

The literature surrounding CEνNS discusses ﬂavor-dependent radiative corrections, often
phrased as a measurement of the neutrino charge radius. In this appendix, we compare our
systematic treatment to the prescription commonly presented in the literature.

The prescription in the literature is to take a tree-level CEνNS cross section and to

make the following replacement [109–111],

for (anti)neutrino ﬂavor ν(cid:96)(¯ν(cid:96)).

An easy point of comparison is our expression for the diﬀerence of the diﬀerential cross
sections. In the prescription advocated in the CEνNS literature [109–111], the diﬀerence
would be given as

which is the same answer one would get starting from eq. (3.4) in me, mµ, mτ
(with me/mµ and mµ/mτ ﬁxed), such that a small Q2 expansion is justiﬁed.

limit

For realistic values of the lepton masses, this prescription is insuﬃcient for electron
(and quite often for muon) ﬂavor and misses crucial Q2 dependence leading to an over-
prediciton of the νe
100 MeV2.
A similar prescription, much closer to our conclusion, is presented in [236, 237] where the
Weinberg angle is replaced by the full Q2-dependent form factor. A low-Q2 expansion is
only permissible for Q2

C Flux-averaged cross sections

In this paper, we have presented precise SM predictions for CEνNS cross sections, but have
intentionally refrained from discussing the experimentally relevant question of event rates
from ﬂux-averaged cross sections. A prediction for the event rate in a given interval of recoil
energy T
[Tmin, Tmax] requires the cross section to be folded against a ﬂux prediction.
To predict the event rate at the few-% level, both the cross section and the ﬂux must be
known to the same level of precision.

∈

Consider a ﬂux of neutrinos sourced by a π+ beam that is stopped in a target. Often
these sources are termed pion decay at rest (πDAR) but they inevitably include contam-
ination from pion decay in ﬂight (πDIF) as well. The pions that do decay produce µ+,
which subsequently decay to ¯νµ, νe, e+. Both the pion and muon decays also receive radia-
tive corrections at the level of a few-%. If one would like to predict the event rate at such

– 26 –

an experiment at a percent level of precision then one requires a prediction for the πDIF
, the leading order πDAR ﬂux (neglecting radiative corrections) for each
component, ΦπDIF
, and the radiative corrections to this ﬂux for each neutrino ﬂavor, Φ(1)
neutrino ﬂavor, Φ(0)
.
ν(cid:96)
ν(cid:96)
Adding all of these together, one would ﬁnd the total ﬂux arriving at the detector accurate
up to corrections of the permille level.

(C.1)

The πDIF ﬂux was a few percent of the leading-order πDAR ﬂux at LSND [238] and is
expected to supply an O(0.5%) contamination at the SNS [194]. We therefore count this at
the same order as the radiative corrections for practical purposes, but ignore the µ− capture
discussed in [194] for brevity’s sake. This ﬂux then must be folded against the neutrino
energy-dependent cross section calculated in this paper

with the integrand evaluated at ﬁxed nuclear recoil energy. Since Q2 = 2MAT , the compli-
cated functional dependence on Q2 (c.f. eq. (2.7)) does not eﬀect the integration over Eν(cid:96)
.
The explicitly Eν-dependent prefactor in eq. (2.2) must be included in both the LO and
NLO expressions for the CEνNS cross section.

Using the expressions in this paper, the monochromatic πDAR ﬂux, and the well known
µDAR ﬂux (all without radiative corrections), the ﬁrst two terms in eq. (C.3) can be
calculated. To calculate the last two terms in the square brackets, predictions for the
corrections to the leading-order πDAR and µDAR ﬂuxes are needed, as is a prediction
for the πDIF component of the ﬂux. We leave a calculation of the πDAR and µDAR
radiative corrections to future work. The πDIF component (and µ− capture component if
it’s contribution is appreciable) requires a dedicated study for each experiment.
