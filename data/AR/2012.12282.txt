1. Introduction

A B S T R A C T

Inverse Heusler alloy Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlms, known as a spin-gapless semiconductor (SGS), grown
by three diﬀerent methods: ultra-high vacuum magnetron spattering, Ar-ion beam assisted sput-
tering, and molecular beam epitaxy, are investigated by comparing their electric transport proper-
ties, microstructures and atomic-level structures. Of the samples, the Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlm grown
by MBE consists of Mn- and Co-rich phases, the structures of which are determined to be the
𝐿21𝐵-type and disordered 𝐿21-type, respectively, according to anomalous XRD analysis. None
of them forms the 𝑋𝐴-type structure expected for SGS Heusler alloy, although they all show
SGS characteristics. We suggest, to validate SGS characteristics, it is necessary to extract not
only magnetic and electric transport properties but also information about microstructures and
atomic-scale structures of the ﬁlms including defects such as atomic swap.

Heusler alloys have attracted much attention over a century since the discovery of the ﬁrst ferromagnetic copper-
manganese-based alloys by Heusler in 1903 [1], due to its unique and diverse nature such as ferromagnetism, thermo-
electronics [2, 3, 4], magnetocaloric eﬀect [5], and shape memory eﬀect [6, 7]. Especially, its half-metal property, i.e.,
conduction electrons that are 100% spin-polarized due to a gap at the Fermi level (𝐸F) in the minority spin channel with
a ﬁnite density of states at the 𝐸F for the majority spin channel [8], is highly desirable for ferromagnetic (FM) materials
in spintronic devices. Among various potential half-metals, Co-based Heusler alloys are particularly promising as the
FM electrodes of magnetoresistive devices since most of them show half-metallicity [9] and high Curie temperatures
(𝑇c) [10].

Recently, a special class of semiconductor, so-called spin-gapless semiconductor (SGS), was proposed using ab-
initio calculations [11], and SGS-like behaviors have been reported experimentally for the Mn-based Heusler com-
pound Mn2CoAl [12] that has high 𝑇c like Co-based ones [10]. SGS, in which the conduction and valence band edges
meet at 𝐸F and there is no gap for one spin channel while there is a ﬁnite gap in another spin channel [11], gives rise
to combined properties of a half-metal and semiconductor. Therefore, SGSs have additional attractive properties other
than 100% spin-polarization such as tunability of 𝐸F by external electronic magnetic ﬁelds and carrier doping[11],
which lead to easy switching between electrons and holes modes. Thus, SGSs can provide highly spin polarized
channels with tunable magnetic properties, which is promising as highly eﬃcient spin injectors.

The Mn2CoAl compound has high Curie temperature (ca. 720 K), small Seebeck coeﬃcient (< 1𝜇 VK−1), low car-
rier concentration (∼ 1017 cm−3), low conductivity with semiconducting temperature dependence (∼ 103 Scm−1 ), and

positive magneto-resistance (MR) at low temperatures (< 100 K) [12], which are considered as characteristic magnetic
and electric transport properties of SGS. However, the recent work using scanning transmission electron microscope
(STEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDS) and synchrotron X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) reported that bulk
Mn2CoAl tends to show phase separation in the equilibrium state [13], suggesting that a stoichiometric Mn2CoAl com-
pound is thermodynamically unstable. For potential application of the material in devices, Mn2CoAl has been studied
in the thin-ﬁlm form as well [14]; however, the SGS features of Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlms largely depend on fabrication
conditions [15, 16, 17, 18]. This is considered to be due to the presence of various anti-site lattice defects in the thin
ﬁlms, which causes diﬀerent local symmetry that destroy the SGS character [19]. Of the many papers on SGSs, there
have been few reports on microstructures and atomic-scale structures, despite this information is critical to validate
their SGS characteristics. In this respect, laboratory-based XRD is not suﬃcient to distinguish structural diﬀerences in
Heusler alloys due to the nearly identical atomic scattering factors of the constituent elements, e.g., Co and Mn at the
Cu K-absorption edge. Therefore, more in-depth structural evaluations of SGS materials are essential to understand
their magnetic and transport properties. Synchrotron anomalous XRD is a solution to address this issue, which of-
fers an element-speciﬁc analysis of atomic-level structures in each crystalline phase and speciﬁc crystallographic sites
within the phase, i.e. the evaluation of the degree of order.

In this study, in addition to electric transport properties, the microstructures and atomic-level structures in Mn2CoAl
thin ﬁlms grown by magnetron sputtering (MS), ion-beam assisted sputtering (IBAS), and molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE) are investigated. Of the samples, the Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlm grown by MBE consists of Mn- and Co-rich phases,
the structures of which are determined to be the 𝐿21𝐵-type and disordered 𝐿21-type in the Strukturbericht designa-
tion [20, 21], respectively, according to synchrotron anomalous XRD. Although all the ﬁlms show SGS characteristics,
we ﬁnd none of them form the 𝑋𝐴-type structure required for the SGS band structure of Mn2CoAl.

2. Experiments

Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlms were prepared using three diﬀerent growth methods as described below. The ﬁrst sample
was grown by conventional ultra high vacuum (UHV) MS system using a sintered Mn50Co25Al25 alloy target. First,
a MgO(001) single crystalline substrate was installed in a UHV chamber (base pressure is about 5 × 10−7 Pa) and
cleaned by Ar ion bombardment. Then, a 50-nm-thick Mn2CoAl ﬁlm was grown by direct-current (DC) magnetron
sputtering at the elevated substrate temperature of 600◦C. The second Mn2CoAl ﬁlm was grown by IBAS. A 90-nm-
thick Mn2CoAl ﬁlm was grown from the Mn2CoAl target on a MgAl2O4 (001) substrate at the substrate temperature
of 400◦C. The Ar ion density from an Ar assist gun during deposition was ∼1013 cm−2 for the Ar beam and acceralator
voltage of 100 V and 400 V, respectively. This ﬁlm was grown by the same IBAS system with almost the same
deposition condition and procedure with the Mn2CoAl ﬁlm reported in a previous study [22]. The third Mn2CoAl ﬁlm
was grown on a MgAl2O4 (001) substrate by MBE. First, the surface of MgAl2O4 substrate was cleaned by the heat
treatment at 600◦C. After cooling down the substrate temperature to 300◦C, a 25-nm-thick Mn2CoAl ﬁlm was grown
by co-evaporating Mn, Co and Al sources using Knudsen cells.

For screening the crystal quality in the three Mn2CoAl ﬁlms, these ﬁlms were investigated by laboratory-based
XRD with Cu K𝛼 radiation. Longitudinal resistivity 𝜌xx was measured by a DC four-probe method. Transverse resis-
tivity 𝜌xy was measured by ﬂowing DC current and applying the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the ﬁlm. Thin samples
for STEM-EDS were prepared by the focused ion beam machine, FEI, Helios G4 UX. High-angle annular dark-ﬁeld
(HAADF) STEM images were acquired with a probe forming aberration corrector operated at 200 kV (FEI, Titan G2
80-200).

Synchrotron anomalous XRD was carried out on the beamline BL13XU [23] at SPring-8. Anomalous XRD has
following advantages: distinguishability of neighboring elements, sensitivity to speciﬁc crystalline phases and occu-
pancy sites adequate for the evaluation of high entropy materials such as Heusler alloys. Intense hard X-rays from the
in-vacuum undulator and the six-circle diﬀractometer are available on the beamline. After an asymmetric-cut Si111
double-crystal monochromator [24], two mirrors are located for rejecting higher harmonics from the undulator. The
double slits conﬁguration with a YAP scintillation detector in a 𝜃-2𝜃 scan was employed in the anomalous XRD mea-
surements, which were performed with an out-of-plane geometry. The X-ray energies near the Co (7.709 keV) and Mn
(6.539 keV) 𝐾-absorption edges were used.

3. Results
3.1. Laboratory XRD, micro structures and transport properties

Figs. 1(a)–(c) show the XRD patterns for the three Mn2CoAl ﬁlms grown by MS, IBAS and MBE, respectively. In
these out-of-plane 𝜃-2𝜃 scan proﬁles, we found only two peaks arising from the Mn2CoAl ﬁlm at around 31–32◦ and
64–66◦. The positions of these two peaks agree well with the peak positions of 002 superlattice and 004 fundamental
peaks expected in the 𝑋𝐴- or 𝐿21-type structure. We also measured a proﬁle by tilting the ﬁlm normal by 54.7◦ to
see the 111 superlattice peak that mainly originates from the ordering between Mn on B-site and Al on D-site in the
𝑋𝐴/𝐿21 structure. A clear peak was observed at around 26◦ only in the Mn2CoAl ﬁlm grown by MBE as shown
in the inset of Fig. 1(c). Therefore, these XRD results suggest the formation of a 𝑋𝐴- or 𝐿21-type structure in the
MBE-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm and those with Mn(B) and Al(D) disorder in MS- and IBAS-Mn2CoAl ﬁlms.

The temperature dependences of the longitudinal resistivity 𝜌xx for these three Mn2CoAl ﬁlms are shown in
Figs. 1(d)–(f). 𝜌xx in all ﬁlms increases with decreasing temperature, which is usually interpreted as the semicon-
ducting property of SGS. Figs. 1(g)–(i) show the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of transverse resistivity 𝜌xy measured at
diﬀerent temperatures for the three Mn2CoAl ﬁlms. The anomalous Hall conductivity 𝜎AHE evaluated from these Hall
curves at low temperature is 15, 10 and 4 Scm−1 for the MS, IBAS and MBE-Mn2CoAl ﬁlms, respectively. Compared
with the 𝜎AHE reported in the bulk Mn2CoAl, 22 Scm−1 at 2 K, by Ouardi et al [12], these 𝜎AHE are comparably small,
which also supports the SGS-like nature of these ﬁlms.

However, microstructure analyses for these ﬁlms using STEM showed diﬀerent aspects from what we expected from
the above-mentioned XRD and transport properties. The HAADF-STEM and EDS mapping for the MS-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm
show clear phase separations with Mn and Co as shown in Figs. 2(a)-(d). This phase separation is naturally understood
from the phase diagram of the MnCoAl in which there is no thermally equilibrium Mn2CoAl phase at 600◦C but
CoAl and Mn phases coexist [25]. Since CoAl phase is expected to have a 𝐵2-ordered structure with the lattice
constant of nearly half of that for Mn2CoAl, the diﬀraction peaks appear at around 32 and 64◦ in the XRD pattern
(Fig. 1(a)), that were regarded as 002 and 004 peaks of Mn2CoAl. However, these correspond to 001 and 002 peaks
of 𝐵2-CoAl, respectively. Although the origins for semiconducting temperature dependence of 𝜌xx and small 𝜌xy in
the MS-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm are unclear, it is inferred that the CoAl phase with a small amount of Mn dissolution might be
ferromagnetic, and this may be attribured to the anomalous Hall eﬀect.

In the IBAS-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm, the phase separation is much weaker than the MS-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm as shown in Figs. 2(e)-
(h), which is explained by relatively lower temperature of the substrate during deposition compared to that of the MS-
Mn2CoAl ﬁlm thanks to an assists from ion-beam bombardment. On the other hand, there is also Mn precipitates in the
IBAS-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm that was clearly conﬁrmed by high-resolution STEM and nano-beam diﬀraction images from the
corresponding region of the Mn precipitates (Figs. 2(i)-(k)). The composition analysis based on EDS mapping indicates
that there are regions with nearly Mn:Co:Al = 2:1:1, together with 𝐵2 ordered structure in the IBAS-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm,
which might contribute to observed SGS-like transport properties [22].

In contrast to the MS- and IBAS-Mn2CoAl ﬁlms, the MBE-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm shows almost homogeneous microstruc-
ture as shown in Fig. 3(a). High-resolution STEM and nano-beam diﬀraction images show only Heusler phase without
a Mn precipitation (Figs. 3(b)-(d)). The 111 diﬀraction spots are clearly detected in the nano-beam diﬀraction taken
from the [110] direction of the Mn2CoAl ﬁlm (Fig. 3(d)), suggesting the formation of 𝑋𝐴 or 𝐿21-phases. It is expected
that the high-quality Mn2CoAl ﬁlm was realized by a thermally non-equilibrium growth of a Mn2CoAl ﬁlm due to
a low temperature MBE technique [18]. In addition, careful analysis of EDS mapping of Mn, Co and Al revealed
that Co-rich and Mn-rich regions in 5 to 10 nm scale (Figs. 3(e)-(g)). The area selective composition analysis for the
Co-rich and Mn-rich regions averaging of total 20 areas for each estimated that the average composition ratio in the
Co-rich region is Mn:Co:Al = 40.8±2.6 : 43.9±5.1 : 15.3±3.6 and Mn-rich region is Mn:Co:Al = 54.0±2.3 : 21.7±3.3
: 24.3±3.3 (See Fig.S1 in supplementary ﬁle).

3.2. Synchrotron anomalous XRD

Fig. 4 shows the rocking curves of the 002 and 004 reﬂections from the three Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlms grown by MS,
IBAS, and MBE, and the corresponding lattice constants derived from the curve peaks. Among these samples, the
ﬁlm prepared by MBE most closely resembles to that of the bulk Mn2CoAl in terms of the 𝑋𝐴 structure (0.584 nm).
The structure of the 𝑋𝐴-type Mn2CoAl inverse Heusler compound with space group 𝐹 ̄43𝑚 is similar to that of the
𝐿21-type (𝐹 𝑚̄3𝑚) full Heusler compound Co2MnAl [19], as shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b), whereas only the 𝑋𝐴-type
structure is predicted to show the SGS properties. Figs. 5 (c) and (d) show the calculations of anomalous XRD for

ideal 𝑋𝐴-Mn2CoAl and 𝐿21-Co2MnAl, and their disordered structures. We observed a peak in the 002 reﬂection and
a dip in the 111 reﬂection for 𝐿21. On other hand, the ideal 𝑋𝐴 shows a dip in 002 and a peak in 111. Therefore, we
can easily distinguish the 𝑋𝐴 and 𝐿21 structures by anomalous XRD.

Figs. 6 (a) and (b) show the experimentally measured anomalous XRD of the 002 superlattice reﬂection and the
intensity ratios 𝐼002/𝐼004 of the 002 (𝐼002) and 004 fundamental reﬂection (𝐼004) near Mn 𝐾-edge, respectively, for
the three Mn2CoAl fabricated by MS, IBAS, and MBE. The 002 reﬂection in the Mn2CoAl ﬁlm grown by MBE only
shows a dip at the Mn K-edge as expected from the calculated results for the 𝑋𝐴 structure (Fig. 5(c)), while the trends
in 𝐼002/𝐼004 for all Mn2CoAl ﬁlms are similar to those calculated for both the 𝑋𝐴 and 𝐿21 structures, as shown in
the inset of Fig. 5(c). According to these results, only the MBE-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm is expected to have a plausible 𝑋𝐴
structure, but the others are not. Therefore, we further carried out a comprehensive atomic-level structural investigation
on the MBE-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm.

In the following structure analysis, the compositions for the two regions, estimated by STEM-EDS mapping
mentioned above, were set to adequate round numbers to simplify the analysis without losing accuracy as follows:
Mn:Co:Al = 40:45:15 for the Co-rich region and Mn:Co:Al = 55:25:20 and 55:20:25 for the Mn-rich region by con-
sidering ambiguity of the estimation. We assumed that the above two regions (Co-rich and Mn-rich regions) are
equally distibuted in the MBE-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm and consist of either the 𝑋𝐴 or 𝐿21 structures as expected from the
high-resolution STEM image in Fig. 3(b). Under these assumptions, we built all possible 13 candidates structural
models for the Co-rich region (Table 1) and 12 models for the Mn-rich region (Table 2) by arranging site occupations
by Mn, Co, and Al with 5% intervals within the 𝑋𝐴 or 𝐿21 framework. Each site A, B, C, and D in Tables 1 and 2
corresponds to the following Wyckoﬀ positions, 4a (0, 0, 0), 4c (1/4, 1/4, 1/4), 4b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), and 4d (3/4, 3/4, 3/4),
respectively.

From the previous study on the similar Co-based Heusler system, Co2(Mn0.6Fe0.4)Ge, reporting the high-formation
energy of Co-Ge than those of Co-Mn and Co-Fe conﬁrmed by ﬁrst principles calculations [26], it is known that Co
atom is reluctant to occupy the Al site, unlikely showing X-Z disorder. Therefore, we can reject model B-2 and B-6
with Co-rich 𝐿21 structure from the candidate in Table 1 at the ﬁrst glance.

For the next step, we calculated the X-ray energy dependence of diﬀraction intensities, 𝐼111, 𝐼002, and 𝐼004, for all
candidate models (25 models) in Tables 1 and 2 at around both the Co 𝐾-absorption edge and Mn 𝐾-absorption edge
by utilizing the analysis software for XRD (SISReX) developed by one of the authors [27]. Thus, totally 150 proﬁles
were investigated. For example, Fig. 7 shows the experimental and calculated energy dependence of the integrated
intensity ratio, 𝐼111/𝐼004 for both the Co-rich and Mn-rich regions. By comparing calculations with the experimental
results of 𝐼002, 𝐼111, 𝐼002∕𝐼004, and 𝐼111∕𝐼004, the best models for the Co-rich and Mn-rich regions were selected
by using the ﬁgure of merit (FOM) that is derived from the summation of all degree of agreements according to the
following ﬁrst criteria: +1: similar dip or peak shape; -1: opposite proﬁle; 0: no peak or dip shape. After the ﬁrst
screening using the FOM, 13 models were reduced to 2 models (A-6 and B-5) for the Co rich region and 12 models
were reduced to 4 models (D-6, D-7, E-1 and E-2) for the Mn-rich region (See the Supplemental ﬁle for in detail).

Then, as shown in Table 3, we consider 8 possible combinations to construct mixed structures from the selected
models of the Co-rich (2 models) and Mn-rich (4 models) regions. As shown in Table 3, we introduced the additive
criteria for deeper evaluations of the mixed structures: +1; a calculated proﬁle has similar shape and peak/dip height
with that experimentally obtained, 0; similar shape but diﬀerent peak/dip height, -1; opposite proﬁle or asymmetrical,
resulting in that the two combinations (B-5&D-7 and B-5&E-2) are plausible. (See the Supplemental ﬁle for in detail).
Now we notice that models Mn-rich 𝑋𝐴 D-7 and 𝐿21 E-2 are indeed identical in its crystallographic deﬁnitions.
Finally, we obtained the best mixed structure consists of models B-5 and D-7, which are attributed to disordered 𝐿21
structure in the Co-rich region and 𝐿21𝐵 structure in the Mn-rich region, respectively. Throughout the above analysis,
structural models which have 𝑋𝐴-like anomalous XRD proﬁles as shown in Figs. 5(c) and (d) tend to get low score
than those with 𝐿21-like proﬁles. These tendencies also support the structures of the MCA-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm are not the
𝑋𝐴-type.

Fig. 8 summarizes the ﬁnal results of anomalous XRD, showing experimental and calculated anomalous XRD
proﬁles and the ﬁnal structure models of the MBE-Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlm. We determined that 𝐿21𝐵 and disordered 𝐿21
crystal structures could be assigned to the Mn-rich and Co-rich regions of the MBE-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm, respectively. The
calculated anomalous XRD proﬁles at the Mn and Co K-edges were in good agreement with the experimental results.
As a result, none of the three ﬁlms including the MBE-Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlm was the 𝑋𝐴-type structure, contrary to our
expectations from their SGS-like transport properties.

4. Discussion

So far, the inﬂuence of various kinds of disorder in Heusler alloy on its functionalities have been discussed [1]. For
example, although it is no doubt that half-metal is the ideal candidate materials for spintronic applications, the spin
polarizations of Heusler alloys are degraded by structural disorder, surface/interface stoichiometry, thermal ﬂuctua-
tions, etc. Regarding Co-based full Heusler alloys Co2YZ, forming the 𝐿21 structure, its spin polarization is rapidly
degraded by introducing the 𝐷03-type structural disorder, while the 𝐵2-type disorder (Y-Z disorder) hardly aﬀect its
spin polarization [28, 29]. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the bulk spin polarization of the half-metal
Co2Mn(Ge0.75Ga0.25) crystalline ﬁlm is enhanced through suppressing the formation of CoMn antisites (Mn site oc-
cupied by Co atom) by increasing Mn composition rate [30], and even in the polycrystalline Co2(Mn0.6Fe0.4)Ge ﬁlm,
its current-perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresitive outputs are enhanced by improving the 𝐵2-order, i.e., elimi-
nating CoMn and CoFe antisites [26]. In contrast to the robustness of half-metallicity against several types of disorder
and defects mentioned above, the electronic structure of SGS is predicted to be very sensitive to any disorder and
defect. While plenty of Heusler alloys have been predicted to exhibit the SGS behavior [31, 32, 33] even in quater-
nary compounds [34, 35, 36], defects such as atomic swaps between sites with diﬀerent local symmetry easily destroy a
pseudo-gap of one spin-channel in the SGS, thus, only a half-metallic gap in another spin channel remains [19, 37, 38].
Although the Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlms prepared using three diﬀerent growth methods showed SGS characteristics, we re-
vealed that they do not have the 𝑋𝐴-type structure required for the SGS band structure. Without seeing microstructures
and atomic-scale structures, previous studies for Heusler-based SGS thin ﬁlms claimed the property of SGS based on
the semiconducting temperature dependence of resistivity and small anomalous Hall conductivity, as observed in the
Mn2CoAl ﬁlms. However, these properties cannot be evidence for a formation of the SGS band structure at all. We
emphasize that evaluation of the aforementioned structural disorder experimentally is critical to validate their SGS
characteristics. Synchrotron anomalous XRD deﬁnitely has addressed this issue by revealing disordered structures in
the MBE-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm at the atomic level, i.e., disorders between close elements, Co and Mn, even in the phase
separated Heusler alloy.

5. Conclusion

We have investigated the Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlms grown by MS, IBAS, and MBE by comparing their electric transport
properties, microstructures and atomic-level structures. Of the samples, the Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlm grown by MBE con-
sisted of Mn- and Co-rich phases, the structures of which have been determined to be 𝐿21𝐵-type and the disordered
𝐿21-type, respectively, according to anomalous XRD analysis. None of them have formed the 𝑋𝐴-type structure
required for the SGS band structure of Mn2CoAl, although they all showed SGS characteristics. The evaluation of var-
ious anti-site lattice defects in the ﬁlms that destroy the SGS band structure is critical to validate SGS characteristics.
Synchrotron anomalous XRD is one of the key solutions to address this issue.

1. Composition analysis

Figures S1(a) and (b) show the area selective composition analysis of the Mn2CoAl thin ﬁlm grown by molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE). Determined compositions of the MBE-Mn2CoAl ﬁlm in the Co-rich and Mn-rich regions are
Mn:Co:Al = 40.8±2.6 : 43.9±5.1 : 15.3±3.6, and 54.0 ±2.3 : 21.7±3.3 : 24.3±3.3, respectively, averaging composi-
tions of total 20 areas for each.

2. Analysis of anomalous XRD
2.1. Screening models in each region

Figures S2 and S3 show the X-ray energy dependence of diﬀraction intensity ratios 𝐼111∕𝐼004 and 𝐼002∕𝐼004 for
the structural models in Tables 1 (Co-rich region) and 2 (Mn-rich region) in the main text, respectively, at around both
the Co 𝐾-absorption edge (7.709 keV) and Mn 𝐾-absorption edge (6.539 keV), in addition to the experimental data.
The integrated intensities at each X-ray energy were measured by rocking scans and corrected by the Lorentz factor,
polarization factor (unity in our experiment), footprint factor, and absorption factor. Synchrotron anomalous X-ray
diﬀraction (XRD) was carried out on the beamline BL13XU [1, 2] at SPring-8. Figures S2(a) and S3(a) also appear
in Figs. 7(a) and (b) in the main text, respectively.

Tables S1 and S2 show the ﬁgure of merit (FOM) that is derived from the summation of all degree of agreements
according to the following ﬁrst criteria: +1: similar dip or peak shape; -1: opposite proﬁle; 0: no peak or dip shape, by
comparing calculations for the Co-rich region and Mn-rich region, respectively, with the experimental results of 𝐼002,
𝐼111, 𝐼002∕𝐼004, and 𝐼111∕𝐼004. Here, B-2 and B-6 models in Table S1 (Site occupations can be found in Table. 1 in
the main text) were rejected since excess amount of Co atom is not plausible to sit on D site in 𝐿21 structure [3]. After
the ﬁrst screening using the above FOM, 13 models were reduced to 2 models (A-6 and B-5) for the Co rich region
and 12 models were reduced to 4 models (D-6, D-7, E-1 and E-2) for the Mn-rich region.

2.2. Calculations for mixed structure

Figures S4 and S5 show the X-ray energy dependence of diﬀraction intensities 𝐼111 and 𝐼002, and intensity ratios
𝐼111∕𝐼004 and 𝐼002∕𝐼004, respectively, for the structural models in Tables 3 (mixed structures in Co-rich and Mn-rich

X-ray beam size of 100 × 100 𝜇m. For all reﬂections (002, 004, and 111), the ﬁlm showed the almost uniform peak-
intensity distribution over the irradiated area except for a few region the intensities were weak, which might reﬂect a
ﬁlm degradation by physical impact during sample handling. We measured synchrotron anomalous XRD at the center
of the sample that showed no ﬁlm degradation.
