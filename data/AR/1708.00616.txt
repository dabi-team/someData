Within the nuclear shell model, we investigate the correction δRO to the Fermi matrix element due
to a mismatch between proton and neutron single-particle radial wave functions. Eight superallowed
0+ → 0+ β decays in the sd-shell, comprised of 22Mg, 26mAl, 26Si, 30S, 34Cl, 34Ar, 38mK and 38Ca are
re-examined. The radial wave functions are obtained from a spherical Woods-Saxon potential whose
parametrizations are optimized in a consistent adjustment of the depth and the length parameter to
relevant experimental observables, such as nucleon separation energies and charge radii, respectively.
The chosen ﬁt strategy eliminates the strong dependence of the radial mismatch correction to a
speciﬁc parametrization, except for calculations with an additional surface-peaked term. As an
improvement, our model proposes a new way to calculate the charge radii, based on a parentage
expansion which accounts for correlations beyond the extreme independent-particle model. Apart
from the calculations with a surface-peak term and the cases where we used a diﬀerent model space,
the new sets of δRO are in general agreement with the earlier result of Towner and Hardy [1]. Small
diﬀerences of the corrected average Ft value are observed.

At present, 14 transitions ranging from 10C to
74Rb are known experimentally with a precision of
0.1% or better, therefore, we must consider all kinds
of side eﬀects of this order of magnitude and esti-
mate the necessary corrections before deducing the
t value. All previous investigations (Ref. [2] and
F
references therein) indicate that the current uncer-
tainty on
is dominated by a set of theoretical
corrections aimed to account for the radiative eﬀects
and the isospin-symmetry breaking in nuclear states.
The latter is strongly structure-dependent and has
the greatest eﬀect on reducing the scatter in the

Over the past 40 years, numerous theoretical work
has been devoted to δC within various approaches.
For example, Towner and Hardy [1, 3, 5] use a nu-
clear shell model with radial wave functions derived
from a Woods-Saxon (WS) potential. The calcula-
tions based on the density functional theory with a
spin and isospin projected technique have been real-
ized by Satula et al [6]. Another approach in which

a model where the main isospin-symmetry-breaking
eﬀects are attributed to the isovector monopole res-
onance. All those calculations lead to a signiﬁcant
spread in the obtained values of δC , raising thus the
question of credibility of the results.

The values for δC tabulated by Towner and Hardy
in Ref. [2] excellently support both the CVC hypoth-
esis over the full range of Z values and the top-row
unitarity of the CKM matrix. However, this agree-
ment is not suﬃcient to reject the other calculations,
since these aspects of the Standard Model could not

The dissensus between model predictions and the

this correction in a consistent approach.

F

Within the nuclear shell model [3, 9], the correc-
tion δC can be represented with good accuracy as a
sum of two terms 1:

δC ≈

δIM + δRO .

(3)

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side (δIM ) accounts
for the isospin mixing among 0+ state wave func-
tions in the parent and daughter nuclei. This part is
calculated from conﬁguration mixing within a shell-
model calculation using charge-dependent interac-
tions. The details of the calculations for δIM are
described in Refs. [3, 9–11]. The last term (δRO) in
Eq. (3) corrects for the deviation from unity of the
overlap integral between the radial part of proton
and neutron single-particle wave functions. The pro-
tons in the parent nucleus are typically less bound
than the neutrons in the daughter nucleus because
of the Coulomb repulsion.

Currently, two types of a mean-ﬁeld potential
are considered for evaluating the correction δRO.
The ﬁrst one is the phenomenological WS poten-
tial including a central, a spin-orbit and an electro-
static repulsion terms. A series of calculations using
this potential has been carried out by Towner and
Hardy [1, 3]. These authors adjusted case-by-case
the depth of the volume term or added an additional
surface-peak term to reproduce experimental pro-
ton and neutron separation energies.
In addition,
they adjusted the length parameter of the central
term to ﬁx the charge radius of the parent nuclei.
The second type of a mean-ﬁeld potential is that

of Towner and Hardy.

obtained from self-consistent HF calculations using
a zero-range Skyrme force, as was ﬁrst proposed by
Ormand and Brown in 1985 [9]. A more completed
compilation for δRO from these authors were pub-
lished later [10, 12].

The values for δRO obtained with both types
of a mean-ﬁeld potential are equivalently in good
agreement with the CVC hypothesis, however, those
resulted from Skyrme-HF calculations are consis-
tently smaller than the others. This discrepancy
has been commonly understood as insuﬃciency of
the Slater approximation for treating the Coulomb
exchange term. Towner and Hardy highlighted that
the asymptotic limit of the Coulomb potential in the
Slater approximation is overestimated by one unit of
Z. To retain this property, they proposed a modi-
ﬁed HF protocol [5], namely they performed a single
calculation for the nucleus with (A
1) nucleons and
1) protons and then using the proton and the
(Z
neutron eigenfunctions from the same calculation to
compute the radial overlap integrals. Their result
leads to a signiﬁcant increase of δRO and provides
a better agreement with the values obtained with
WS eigenfunctions. However, this method is rooted
to the Koopman’s theorem which is not fully re-
spected by such HF calculations, in particular, with
a density-dependent eﬀective interaction.

In the present paper, we propose a comprehen-
sive and detailed study of the radial-overlap correc-
tion to superallowed 0+

ments using the nuclear shell model with WS single-
particle wave functions. A special emphasis is given
on the choice of the WS potential parametrization
and optimization procedure. We limit ourselves to
the sd-shell nuclei, for which very precise shell-model
wave functions are available. Once the method is
established, we plan to extend this study to heavier
emitters, using large-scale shell-model diagonaliza-
tion and modern eﬀective interactions.

The article is organized as follows. The general
formalism is given in section II. Section III is devoted
to the selection of a WS potential parametrization
with brief discussion of physics aspects behind the
construction. In section IV, we carry out a simpli-
ﬁed calculation of δRO without taking into account
the sum over intermediate states. The sensitivity
to the choice of the parametrization and adjustment
procedure is investigated. In section V, we present
our ﬁnal results on the correction, obtained from
a full parentage expansion for both δRO correction
and charge radii of the parent nuclei. The charge
radii are computed using two diﬀerent methods with

tal data, under the assumption that the CVC hy-
pothesis is valid. Comparison with the previously

II. GENERAL FORMALISM

Even though the basic formulas we are going to
use are already described by several authors [3, 9,
13, 14], it is worth summarizing them here.

We start from the exact formalism developed in
Refs. [13, 14] which uses the basis states given by a
realistic mean-ﬁeld potential with presence of isospin
non-invariant terms. A mismatch between neutron
and proton radial wave functions leads to the nodal-
mixing relation:

βp =

a†
αn h

αn|

βpi

,

Xα

(4)

where we use the subscript p to indicate proton
states and n for neutron states, and the sum is over
the radial quantum number only. The operator aα
destroys a nucleon in quantum state α whereas the
operator a†
α creates a nucleon in that state, with
α standing for the whole set of spherical quantum
numbers: α = (nα, lα, jα, mα). The overlap matrix
in Eq. (4) is given by:

where

and the Kronecker delta, δ′
αβ, represents the orthog-
onality of the angular part of single-particle wave
functions due to the spherical symmetry, that is
δ′
δmαmβ . The symbol Rαn (r)
αβ = δlαlβ ×
and Rβp (r) denote single-particle radial wave func-
tions of a neutron and a proton respectively,

δjαjβ ×

Within Eq. (4), the nuclear matrix element for the

superallowed β+-decay can be expressed as

MF = M T H

F + δMF ,

(7)

where M T H
has been referred to as the Towner-
Hardy term and δMF is an interference term as sug-

where t+ is the exact isospin raising operator which
satisﬁes the isospin commutation relations (see dis-
denote the ini-
cussion in Ref. [14]), and

tial and the ﬁnal nuclear states, respectively. Here,
we use the proton-neutron formalism, therefore in
coordinate representation the operator t+ is equiva-
lent to the identity operator, thus the single-particle
matrix elements are reduced to

Here we notice that it is not possible to include the
interference term within the shell model because of
the nodal mixing which requires a large model space
(at least 2 oscillator shells). For this reason, we will
stay within the same approximation as Towner and
Hardy [1, 3] which considers only the diagonal term.

It has been pointed out by Miller and Schwenk [14]
on the basis of a schematic model that both terms in
Eq. (7) are of the same order of magnitude. No real-
istic calculation have been performed yet. Although
the model of Towner and Hardy lacks the interfer-
ence term, the calculated δC values eliminate much
of the important scatter present in the uncorrected
f t values. This may be considered as an evidence
that the terms omitted by Towner and Hardy must
be either nucleus independent or must have a negli-
gible eﬀect.

sition density due to the isospin-symmetry breaking

Since the isospin-symmetry-breaking eﬀect
is
small, it is convenient to neglect higher-order terms
of Eq. (13). In this way one obtains a suitable ex-
pression for δC as given in Eq. (3), with the radial
overlap part :

(17)

with i denoting either 0 for the central term (the
ﬁrst term on the the right-hand side of Eq. (16))
or s for the spin-orbit term (the second term on the
right-hand side of Eq. (16)). The radius, Ri, and the
diﬀuseness of the surface, ai, are ﬁxed parameters.
The independent-particle model utilizing the po-
tential given in Eq. (16) cannot be solved analyt-
ically, therefore it is not possible to separate out
the spurious center-of-mass contribution. To the au-
thors’ knowledge, the most practical way for elim-
inating such a contribution is to adopt artiﬁcially
the nucleon-core/target concept from the optical
model [15]. Based on that two-body picture, the
one-body Schrödinger equation could be solved in
relative coordinates by simply replacing the nucleon
mass, m with the reduced mass:

(15)

where A is the mass number of the composite nu-
cleus.

The initial and ﬁnal state wave functions will be
determined by diagonalization of a well-established
shell-model eﬀective Hamiltonian in a spherical
(harmonic-oscillator) many-body basis. With addi-
tion of isospin non-conserving terms, one can ob-
tain isospin-mixed wave functions that can be used
to compute δIM . The contribution δRO beyond the
model space is accounted for by the overlap inte-
grals, Ωα, which slightly deviate from unity when
evaluated with realistic radial wave functions.

Note also that all terms in Eq. (16) are local,
this corresponds to the Hartree approximation of
the self-consistent mean-ﬁeld theory. We therefore
encounter the self-interaction eﬀects due to the lack
of exchange terms. In general, this problem is reme-
died with the assumption that the mean-ﬁeld poten-
tial being generated by only the (A
1) nucleons
of the core nucleus, neglecting thus the contribution
of the nucleon of interest. Within this restriction,
any mass dependence should be expressed in terms
1) instead of A. Thus, the radii read

III. WOODS-SAXON POTENTIAL

The standard form of a WS potential is based
upon the sum of a spin-independent central term,
a spin-orbit term, an isospin-dependent term, and a

Ri = ri ×

(A

−

1)1/3 .

(19)

The Woods-Saxon form (17) decreases exponen-
tially with increasing radius. This is in strong agree-
ment with the fact that the density of nucleons in the
nucleus is fairly constant in the interior and drops
smoothly to zero beyond the nuclear radius [16], and

4

further it is eﬃcient in satisfying the saturation fea-
tures of nuclear forces.

The spin-orbit term is taken to have the Thomas
form [17], similar to that used for electrons in atoms
which was derived from the Dirac theory. Although
it takes a similar form, the nuclear spin-orbit cou-
pling is not a relativistic correction, but a ﬁrst order
term in the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction. It is
well known that such a force is responsible for the
shell structure of nuclei and of the opposite sign to
that in atoms. In general, the spin-orbit radius (rs)
is smaller than the radius (r0) of the volume term,
because of the very short range of the two-body spin-
orbit interaction [18].

There is numerous experimental evidence [15, 19,
20] from both positive and negative energies for the
shift between the nuclear part of neutron and proton
potentials. To account for this eﬀect, we have to add
to the nuclear single-particle potential an isospin-
dependent term. A number of authors [21, 22] have
proposed a simple form which tends to favor a bal-
anced conﬁguration of neutrons and protons, namely

T ′

where tz is the isospin projection of the nucleon, with
1/2 for proton, and T ′
tz = 1/2 for neutron and
z
is the isospin projection of the core/target nucleus.
The form factor in Eq. (20) is assumed to have the
same form as the volume term.

(20)

−

It was pointed out later by Lane [19, 20] that the
symmetry term (20) is an averaged version of a more
fundamental formula which contains a dependence
on the scalar product of the isospin operators of a
nucleon (t) and a core nucleus (T ′) (see also discus-
sion in Ref. [23]):

In principle, we could include all extended sym-
metry preserving terms which involve the nucleon
operators p, r, σ, t and the core spin and isospin
operators T ′ and J ′. However, most of these terms
were found to be small [15], only the isospin depen-
dence of the spin-orbit strength, i.e.

must be included for study of neutron-rich nuclei.

The depth of each term in Eq. (16) depends in
general on momentum, reﬂecting the nonlocal nature
of the nuclear potential [15, 19, 20]. However, the
higher order terms are usually neglected and only the
zero order term (a constant) is taken into account.
At last, the repulsive long-range Coulomb poten-
tial is determined from the assumption of a uni-
formly charged sphere of a radius Rc. For numer-
ous applications, this is a good approximation be-
cause the inﬂuence of the surface diﬀuseness of the
charge distribution on the strength of the Coulomb
potential is not strong. The well-known analytical

charge distribution of the proton and b being the

There exist in literature a number of the WS po-
tential parametrizations (Refs. [18, 23, 27–30] and
references therein), constructed with diﬀerent objec-
tives and relevant for diﬀerent nuclear mass regions.
In this work, we select two parametrizations that
seem to us to be appropriate for our purposes. One
of them is that of Bohr and Mottelson [18], modi-
ﬁed as proposed in Ref. [31] and denoted as BMm,
while the other is that of Schwierz, Wiedenhöver and
Volya (SWV), published in Ref. [23]. They diﬀer
mainly by the isovector term which represents the
second source of the isospin-symmetry violation in a

.

WS potential. The parametrization BMm includes
the symmetry term of the form Eq. (20), whereas
the other employs the isospin coupling as given in
Eq. (21). For heavy nuclei with large neutron excess,
the diﬀerence is small. However, it leads to signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent predictions in lighter nuclei around
N = Z line, which is the region of primary interest of
our study. Note also that in the SWV parametriza-
tion, the radii of the central and the spin-orbit terms
are calculated with respect to the composite nucleus,
A1/3, respectively.

The occupations nαp are equal to (2j +1) for fully-
ﬁlled orbitals of an inert core, while for valence or-
bitals the occupation numbers are obtained from the
shell-model diagonalization.

As seen from Fig. 1, for nuclei of the lower part of
the sd shell, including 22Mg, 26mAl, 26Si and 30S, the
calculated values of charge radii considerably over-
estimate the experimental data. At the same time,
for 34Cl and 38Ca our theoretical calculations work
rather well.

To date, all calculations of δRO include a reﬁne-
ment that accommodates the whole spectrum of the
1) nucleus. However, it is instruc-
intermediate (A
tive to ﬁrst consider the simplest approach which
assumes that the ground state of the (A
1) nu-
cleus is a unique parent. A calculation of this type
would be too crude to produce quantitative result
for δRO. Rather, our purpose here is to study the
parametrization dependence and to see how the cor-
rection will be changed when the calculation is car-
ried out with the full parentage expansion, as will
be done in the next section.

−

With the two parameter sets of a WS potential
from Table I, we have calculated the δRO correc-
tion using the formalism outlined in section II. We
choose only sd shell emitters which, most of them,
are well described by the so-called universal sd in-
teractions — USD, USDA/B [32, 33]. They include
22Mg, 26mAl, 26Si, 30S, 34Cl, 34Ar, 38mK and 38Ca.
Six of these transitions are used to deduce the most

the

Obviously,

δRO correction is

strongly
parametrization dependent, as illustrated in the
lower panel of Fig. 1. With both parameter sets,
there appears to be some sort of odd-even stag-
gering. Namely, for the parent nuclei with even
Z (N
= Z), we obtained a large overlap between
proton and neutron radial wave functions, thus δRO
increases.
In cases of odd Z (N = Z), the over-
lap is very closed to unity, thus resulting in a very
small correction value. This eﬀect is solely gener-
ated by the isovector terms which also violate the
isospin symmetry. The SWV parametrization has
a stronger odd-even oscillation, indicating that its
isospin-dependent term has a stronger eﬀect than
that of the other parametrization.

Note that the parameter sets in Table I were deter-
mined by a global ﬁt to various ground-state prop-
erties of nuclei around doubly-magic nuclei, they
are generally not adequate for open-shell nuclei far
including those
away from the valley of stability,
considered in the present study. One could also

These results are the averages of three values obtained
with the USD, USDA and USDB eﬀective interactions.
However, there is a great consensus among these inter-
actions, the resulting uncertainties are negligible. The
experimental data on 34Ar and 38K are taken from
Ref. [35], while Ref. [1] is used for the others.

notice that these parametrizations do not account
for the charge-symmetry-breaking eﬀects which have
been observed in nucleon-nucleon elastic scatter-
ing [36]. Furthermore, the charge symmetric isovec-
tor term (20) or (21) is somehow related to the diﬀer-
ence between neutron and proton numbers, thus can
vanish in some particular conditions. Obviously, this
latter property does not agree with the HF case [9],
because the isovector component of a self-consistent
mean ﬁeld can not be identically zero due to the
diﬀerence between proton and neutron densities.

22Mg

The WS potential is constructed based on the nu-
clear phenomenology, it does not have a direct con-
nection to the nucleon-nucleon interaction as in the
HF case. To improve the accuracy of the WS po-
tential, we could add either additional terms or in-
crease the number of parameters. For example, one
could deﬁne diﬀerently the form factor for the vol-
ume, spin-orbit and isospin-dependent terms. How-

26Al

30S

ever, this idea is always limited, because of the lack
of experimental data to constrain new parameters.
In general, we only have the charge radii and the sep-
aration energies which could be predicted by the WS
model. In what follows, we adopt the simplest strat-
egy, re-adjusted case-by-case the parameter r0 and
V0 to reproduce the charge radii and the separation
energies respectively, while the other parameters are
ﬁxed at the standard values.

According to the Koopman’s theorem, the en-
ergy of the highest occupied orbital is approximately
equal to the nucleon separation energy with an op-
posite sign. Therefore, one usually ﬁts the last occu-
pied single-particle state and keeps the same poten-
tial to get all the other radial wave functions. How-
ever, this corresponds to the extreme independent-
particle model. For the present study, we re-adjusted
V0 for each valence orbital separately. We believe
that this method is more consistent with the shell
model in which the single-particle states are partly
occupied.

The results obtained from these calculations are
illustrated in Fig 2, from which it can be seen that,
within the re-adjusted parametrizations, the stag-
gering on δRO becomes softer and the parametriza-
tion dependence is completely removed. The rea-
son is that the ﬁt of separation energies aﬀects the
original
isospin-dependence terms of the selected
parametrizations, and brings them to a new term
determined by the diﬀerence between neutron and
proton separation energies. We recall that in the
SWV parametrization, the radii of the potential are
expressed with A instead of (A
1), that is why
the resulting values of r0 are about 1.2% lower than
those obtained with the BMm parametrization.

−

Two sources of uncertainties are considered, one
is the error on the experimental data of charge radii
and the other is the spread of results obtained with
diﬀerent shell-model eﬀective interactions. We as-
sume that the calculations with diﬀerent interac-
tions provide a set of independent values, we can
thus apply statistics to describe this data set. Our
adopted values are the normal averages (arithmetic
means), while the spread of the individual values
being considered as a statistical uncertainty that fol-
lows a normal (or Gaussian) distribution. The un-
certainties are dominated by the errors on the exper-
imental charge radii and they only weakly depend
on a particular eﬀective interaction and as speciﬁc
parametrization of the WS potential. For this rea-
son, we consider this source of uncertainties as sys-
tematic. To cover the small spread, the maximum
value has to be chosen.

For each individual calculation, we compute the

34Cl

charge radii and the radial overlap correction for four
diﬀerent values of r0 around 1.26 fm. Both quanti-
ties can be very well approximated by linear func-
tions in the vicinity of 1.26 fm. So, we ﬁt the results
by straight lines, e.g.

where a, b, c and d are the regression coeﬃcients.

Once these coeﬃcients are determined, we can de-
duce the radial overlap correction and the length pa-
rameter that correspond to the experimental charge
radii. To extract the systematic uncertainty on δRO,
we followed the error propagation rule,

In this equation, σr0 is the systematic uncertainty

the coeﬃcients c and d, obtained from the ﬁt. Note
that, for all cases, the dispersion of the data points
around the straight line is almost negligible, thus the
errors σc and σd are generally not signiﬁcant.

It is important to remark that σsyst depends on
the sensitivity to the length parameter (on a and c
values in Eq. (29)) which can be varied from nucleus
to nucleus. This eﬀect will be discussed further in
the next section.

V. RADIAL OVERLAP CORRECTION
WITH FULL PARENTAGE EXPANSION

V.1. Formalism

Although the δRO correction is determined by the
overlap between the radial wave function of the de-
caying proton in the parent nucleus and that of the
resulting neutron in the daughter nucleus, both of
these particles are bound to the intermediate sys-
tem with (A
1) nucleons, therefore the structure of
this nucleus proves to be important as well [1, 3, 9].
In the previous section, we have taken only the
separation energies relative to the ground states.

Now, we extend our model to include more com-
plete information associated with that system as was
done in Refs. [1, 3, 9]. We expand the δRO correc-
tion by inserting a complete sum over intermediate
into the transition densities, be-
states

Under this assumption, we obtain,

Ei = Eπ + ǫαp and Ef = Eπ + ǫαn ,

(34)

where ǫα is the single-particle energy of a valence
orbital, Ei/Ef is the energy of the initial/ﬁnal state
and Eπ is the energy of an intermediate state.
From Eq. (34), we can extract ǫα from experimen-
tal ground-state masses and excitation energies of
the intermediate nucleus [37]. Where experimental
excitation energies are not available, we use those
predicted by the shell model.

The expression (32) allows us to go beyond the

α on the excitation energies of the in-

tune our potential so that the individual energies
of valence space orbitals match experimental proton
and neutron separation energies.

−

In general, it is not possible to account for all
intermediate states because of the computational
limit. However, since spectroscopic amplitudes de-
crease on average with increasing excitation energy
Eπ, one can impose a robust truncation at a cer-
M 0
tain number of states, Nπ. The variations of
F |
and δRO as a function of Nπ are displayed in Fig. 3.
From the top panel, it is seen that the Fermi matrix
element does not converge quickly. For the transi-
tions in the middle of the sd shell, with Nπ = 150 for
each spin and parity, the value of
is still oﬀ its
model-independent value. Fortunately, the correc-
, because
tion δRO converges much faster than
Ωπ
of the factor (1
α) which decreases monotonically
with increasing of Eπ and tends to zero ﬁnally. For
all sd-shell emitters, one can use Nπ=100 as a rea-
sonable cut-oﬀ for the number of intermediate states.

Within the shell model exploited here, only a lim-

spirit, we calculate the charge radii by two diﬀerent
methods. Following method I, we extract the contri-
bution of core orbitals from the experimental charge

For most cases, it is the ground state of the parent nu-
clei, except for 26Al and 38K. For these two cases, such a
state has an excitation energy of 228.3 keV and 130.4 keV,
respectively.

where ¯Z = Z/Zc is the ratio between the atomic
number of parent and core nucleus. The third line
of Eq. (39) accounts for the mass-dependence of the
potential. We obtained this term using harmonic os-
cillator wave functions (more details of the formal-
ism can be found in Ref. [38]). The symbols n′ and
l′ stand for the radial and orbital angular momen-
tum quantum numbers of the highest ﬁlled level of
the core, bc and Ac are the oscillator parameter and
the mass number, respectively, of the closed-shell nu-
cleus. The fourth line of Eq. (39) is the center-of-
mass correction for the closed-shell nucleus, similar
to that in Eq. (26). This method avoids the energy
dependence of the nuclear mean ﬁeld which could
be signiﬁcant for deeply bound states, as suggested
from the optical model [15, 19, 20] and also from HF
calculations using Skyrme forces [16].

With method II we calculate the charge radii with

10

where the sum in the second line of Eq. (40) runs
over all inactive orbits below the shell-model valence
space. Since these orbits are assumed to be fully
ﬁlled, the proton occupancies are taken as (2j + 1).
We notice that the energy dependence is not ac-
counted for in Eq. (40), however this method is free
from the mass-dependent correction which is neces-
sary in the previous method.

We have explored the predictive power of these
new approaches for charge radii. We found that,
with V0 as the only adjustable parameter, the pre-
dictive ability of our methods I and II is much bet-
ter than that of the traditional approach, except for
34Cl for which the value obtained from an isotope-
shift estimation [1] is particularly large.

As we have mentioned in the introduction, a se-
ries of calculations of δRO using the shell-model ap-
proach have been carried out by Towner and Hardy.

 
However, these authors determine the parameter r0
by requiring the mean-square radii computed from
the traditional approach, Eq. (27), to match the
experimental values, while the dependence on in-
termediate states is not taken into account. Then
the resulting r0 values are kept for the calculations
of δRO in the full parentage-expansion formalism.
In the latter step, the depth of the central term is
independently re-adjusted to reproduce the separa-
tion energies with respect to multiple-intermediate
states. We notice that, in principle, the two param-
eters could not be unambiguously determined in this
way, instead the ﬁt should be performed using the
least-squares method which ensures the optimization
of the resulting radial wave functions.

Thanks to the generalization of the formalism for
charge radii described above, we are able now to
adjust the potential depth, V0 and the length pa-
rameter, r0 in a self-consistent way. The ﬁnal indi-
vidual energy spectra and wave functions are capa-
ble thus to reproduce simultaneously the one-proton
and one-neutron separation energies and the exper-
imental charge radii of the parent nuclei. Our re-
sults with full parentage expansion are shown in
Fig. 4. Although we use two diﬀerent parametriza-
tions of the WS potential (SWV and BMm), when
the depth, V0 and the length parameter, r0 are re-
adjusted, they lead to very similar result. Note that
the same situation had occurred in our calculations
with the traditional approach (see discussions in sec-
tion IV). Moreover, the δRO correction does not sig-
niﬁcantly depend on the treatment of closed-shell
orbits, it is seen that each method only produces
marginally diﬀerent values throughout the sd shell.
However, the r0 values resulting from method II are
closer to 1.26 fm, the value obtained from a global
ﬁt [23]. We found in practice that the ﬁt of charge
radii based on method I is generally less appropri-
ate because of low sensitivity. Since the closed-shell
contribution is taken from the experimental data,
the charge radii calculated with Eq. (39) are almost
model-independent, particularly for a small number
of valence protons. Accordingly, the uncertainties
quoted in the BMm-I and SWV-I results are more
than twice larger than those produced by method II.
The numerical values of the r0 parameter and of the
δRO corrections are listed in Table V of Appendix.
Comparing these results with a result generated
by the traditional approach (BMm) in which the
depth and the length parameter are also re-adjusted
but only the ground state energy of the (A
1) nu-
cleus is considered, it is evident that the introduction
of multiple-intermediate states has the eﬀect of in-
creasing both the radial overlap correction and the

−

length parameter, particularly for the transitions in
the upper part of the sd shell.

V.3. Surface terms

Although the WS potential

is a kind of phe-
nomenological mean ﬁeld, it has its theoretical basis
related to the saturation properties of nuclear mat-
ter as discussed in section III. Thus, instead of con-
tinuously varying the central part of the potential,
it is recommended [39] to include an extra surface-
peaked term and adjust its strength to reproduce the
nucleon separation energies. Two terms have been
considered in the literature [1], namely,

where (~/mπc)
1.4 fm is the pion Compton wave-
length, while Vg and Vh being adjustable parameters.
However, we found that the term, Vh(r) has a very
weak eﬀect on the single-particle spectra, the ﬁt of
separation energies results thus a large value of Vh
and generates a high peak on the WS potential at
nuclear surface. Furthermore, the inclusion of Vh(r)
leads to an unusual (quadratic) correlation between
the charge radius and the length parameter as shown
in Fig. 5. This property is in disagreement with the
uniform-density liquid drop model [40], and more-
over it deteriorates our optimization procedure. For
these reasons, we do not use this term for our study
of δRO. On the contrary, the term, Vg(r) has a much
stronger eﬀect on the single-particle spectra, there-
fore the WS potential complemented with Vg(r) does
not encounter any particular problem.

Vh was adjusted separately for a proton and a neutron
to get the experimental energies relative to various in-
termediate states, whereas the length parameter, r0, was
re-adjusted to reproduce the experimental charge radius.

of the central term, V0, in such a way that the cal-
culated energy of the last occupied orbit matches
the experimental separation energy relative to the

tal charge radii of the parent nuclei. The other pa-
rameters are kept ﬁxed at the standard values. The
results of these calculations are reported in Fig. 6,
with the labels BMm-IIG and SWV-IIG.

Let us ﬁrst emphasize the eﬀect of the Vg(r) term
on the charge radii. With r0 being ﬁxed, they come
out to be larger and for most cases overestimate
the experimental values, especially the calculation

However, within the BMm parametrization the cal-
culated charge radii for 22Mg, 34Cl and 38Ca are
somewhat lower than the experimental values. The
numerical result of this calculation is reported in Ta-
ble II.

As the radii computed using WS radial wave func-
tions are generally proportional to the length param-
eter, our ﬁt results thus in smaller r0 as seen from
Fig. 6, except the three cases mentioned above. Al-
though these calculations produce smaller r0, the
δRO values for the cases with masses between A = 22
and 30, are in fair agreement with those obtained
in the calculations without the Vg(r) term. As for
the other transitions, the SWV-IIG values of δRO
are about 23% lower than the BMm-II or SWV-II
values, whereas those obtained from the BMm-IIG
model drop by about 13% only. Furthermore, in
this heavy-mass region, the inclusion of the Vg(r)
term leads to a signiﬁcant dependence on the WS
parametrization, even though the parameter V0 has
been also re-adjusted for the ground state. Note that
the uncertainties on these latter results are some-

 
 
 
what larger than the uncertainties on the results of
method II (see Table V), that is to say that the
sensitivity to r0 becomes lower (the coeﬃcient c in
Eq. (30) increases) when we include the Vg(r) term.

are the results for the radial overlap correction and
the length parameter as obtained based on method II,
while the parametrizations (BMm and SWV) are com-
plemented with the surface term Vg(r). Our calculations
without Vg(r) term (BMm-II and SWV-II) as well as the
earlier (TH2002 [1]) and the recent (TH2008 [3]) calcu-
lations of Towner and Hardy are shown for comparison.

V.4. Discussion

Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the present re-
sults with the recent (TH2008, Ref. [3]) and ear-
lier (TH2002, Ref. [1]) results of Towner and Hardy.
The latter correspond to the values tabulated in
the last column of Table V in Ref. [1], where the
shell-model calculations for nuclei between A = 22
and 34 have been done in the full sd shell and for
those with A = 38, the model space included the
0f7/2 orbital while the 0d5/2 orbital being frozen. In
2008 [3], these authors reported that the core polar-
ization has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on δRO. Since then

they evaluate the radial overlap correction with the
inclusion of the orbitals outside the valence space,
their method is based on shell-model calculations of
the spectroscopic amplitudes, but limits the sums
over single-particle orbitals to those for which large
spectroscopic factors have been observed in neutron
pick-up reactions. We do not consider this eﬀect in
the present study, our work in this direction is in
progress.

With the exception of 30S, the BMm-II or SWV-II
values for δRO are on average 12% larger than those
of TH2002. This augmentation could be understood
as due to the increase of r0 because our calcula-
tion takes into account all intermediate states for
the charge radius. Perhaps, for the cases of A = 38,
this eﬀect is partly due to the inclusion of the 0f7/2
orbital in the TH2002 calculation. The fact that
Towner and Hardy obtained a larger value for 30S
may rely on the cut-oﬀ for the sum over interme-
diate states (this information is not stated in their
articles). Although a full sd-shell model space cal-
culation is, at present, feasible for all nuclei with
20, the convergence of one hundred
8
states in the mid-shell region is still time-consuming.
The values obtained from the recent calculations of
Towner and Hardy (TH2008) are somewhat larger
than their earlier result (TH2002), especially for
22Mg. This may be due to the diﬀerent model spaces
used as we have mentioned above.
It can be seen
from Fig. 6 that the δRO values resulting from our
SWV-IIG calculation follow a very similar trend to
that of the TH2008 values, but they are about 16%
lower in magnitude. One could quickly guess that
these two sets of δRO will produce a very similar
agreement with the CVC hypothesis, but with dif-
ferent

t values.

N, Z

≤

≤

Note that the results of Towner and Hardy are
obtained from their assessment of all multiple-
parentage calculations made for each decay, includ-
ing the calculation without additional terms and the
calculation with the Vh(r) and Vg(r) terms. How-
ever, each of these calculations produced very simi-
lar values of δRO because they used the same set of
the length parameter which are determined using a
traditional method (see discussions in Ref. [1]).

F

We notice that the calculation with a surface-peak
term could be very dependent on the ﬁtting proce-
dure. For example if one ﬁxes the depth of the vol-
ume term (V0) the same for the proton and the neu-
tron, then one adjusts the parameter Vg and r0 to
reproduce the relevant experimental observables, the
conventional isovector terms presented in the central
part of the potential will not or only weakly be af-
fected by this optimization procedure because of the

13

 
 
diﬀerence between the form factor of the volume and
the surface term. Consequently, the resulting δRO
will show a stronger odd-even staggering as we have
seen in section IV.

the inaccuracy of the δRO values generated by this
method because of the sensitivity problem, as dis-
cussed in the previous section. Along these lines,
the BMm-I and SWV-I calculations must deﬁnitely
be rejected. Concerning the results of method II, the
agreement with CVC is somewhat better, but still
signiﬁcantly poorer than the two results of Towner
and Hardy. In contrast, the calculations which in-
clude the Vg(r) term represent the best model for
generating a set of δRO corrections, satisfying the
CVC hypothesis. The values resulting from the
BMm-IIG calculation are of similar quality to those
of TH2002, whereas the SWV-IIG calculation pro-
duce an even better result and are comparable to
that of TH2008.

F

In order to assess the constancy of the

t values
from the 8 sets of δRO on an equal footing, we per-
form a parallel analysis, by setting for all models,
the theoretical uncertainties on δRO to be equal to
zero. The outcome is given in the right part of Ta-
ble III, column 5 to 7. It is seen that the omission of
this source of uncertainties only slightly aﬀects the
weighted averages. The χ2/ν values are systemati-
cally increased, resulting thus in a lower conﬁdence
level. Nevertheless, the conclusions of a comparative
analysis of various methods remain unchanged.

3 To simplify, we take this value directly from Ref. [2]. Re-
garding their procedure, such uncertainty could depend on
the sample size and on the calculated δRO values.

However, it might be too early to draw any conclu-
sion about the Standard Model because our samples
are made up of only 6 out of the 14 best-known su-
perallowed transitions. Our purpose is rather to pro-

14

vide, at least qualitatively, an alternative assessment
for our theoretical models, and to compare with the
previous calculations.

VII. CVC TEST FOR δRO CORRECTION

±

In this section, we carry out the conﬁdence-level
test proposed recently by Towner and Hardy [42],
taking into account the experimental uncertainties,
as well as uncertainties on δRO and the other the-
oretical correction terms. The test is based on the
assumption that the CVC hypothesis is valid to at
0.03%, which is the level of precision cur-
least
rently attained by the best f t-value measurements.
This implies that a set of structure-dependent cor-
rections should produce a statistically consistent set
of

F
If we assume that the CVC hypothesis is satis-
ﬁed (
t is constant), without regarding the CKM
unitarity, we can convert those experimental f t val-
ues into experimental values for structure-dependent
corrections and compare the results with each theo-
retical calculation in turn. Since the isospin mixing
correction δIM is small compared to the radial over-
lap correction δRO and only one set of calculated
δN S correction exists [43], pseudo-experimental val-
ues for δRO can thus be deﬁned by

t values.

out to be greatly consistent with the CVC hypoth-
esis with the optimized values of χ2/ν ranging from
0.1 to 0.4 and the conﬁdence level being greater than
80 %. However, there is a signiﬁcant spread among
model calculations in the deduced

seen that with the exceptions of the BMm-IIG and
tR values are about 3 s lower

than the weighted averages,
From these results, we conclude that the statis-
tical analysis of this section has very low compar-
ative power. The result given in Table IV is not
accurate enough to make a clear decision on select-
ing one of the theoretical models. This indicates
that the χ2 test, Eq. (45), is not sensitive to small
spreads between the correction sets. Obviously, al-
though method I has been found to be inappropri-
ate, the present analysis yields a good agreement
of these correction values with the CVC hypothesis,
comparable to the other calculations summarized in
Table V. It is likely that a weak sensitivity of the χ2
test based on Eq. (45) is due to the small number of
transitions considered here and the result should be
reconsidered when more emitters are included.

To close this section, two remarks can be done:

•

The shell-model conﬁguration space for the
cases with A = 38 is relatively small. These
nuclei, having two holes coupled to the inert
40Ca core, have been the subject of recent in-
terest, both experimental and theoretical. Re-
sults of several theoretical calculations have

15

emphasized the inadequacy of the shell model
to explain their structure if the conﬁguration
is limited to the sd shell. One of the most ex-
plicit example is that such a model space can-
not generate negative-parity states. We expect
that the agreement of our results with CVC
will be improved if the conﬁguration space is
shell orbitals.
extended to cover the lowest pf

−

•

It is astonishing that our calculations that
include the surface term, Vg(r), are in very
good agreement with the CVC hypothesis. It
is demonstrated in the previous section that,
with ﬁxed r0, these calculations failed in re-
producing the experimental charge radii, espe-
cially the SWV-IIG model.

VIII. SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES

have

investigated

We have performed a detailed and critical study
of the radial overlap correction, which is the major
part of the isospin-symmetry-breaking correction to
superallowed 0+
0+ β decay. 8 emitters in the sd
shell have been re-examined, using the USD, USDA
and USDB eﬀective interactions, while the single-
particle matrix elements of the transition operator
are calculated with WS eigenfunctions.

parametrizations with diﬀerent
isovector terms,
optimizing them in a two-parameter grid (r0, V0)
to experimental nuclear charge radii and nucleon
separation energies. As a new feature, we have
introduced a parentage expansion to the nuclear
charge radius, allowing us to perform a consistent
adjustment of both parameters. All results have
been thoroughly studied with respect to conver-
gence as a function of the number of intermediate
states. Two diﬀerent approaches to nuclear charge
radii with respect to the treatment of closed-shell
orbitals and two diﬀerent choices for adjusting the
WS potential (variation of the central or surface
term) led us to propose a set of six calculations of
the correction for sd
shell nuclei. However, two
calculations have been found to be inappropriate
because of their low sensitivity when treating the
contribution of closed-shell orbits as a constant,
taken from experimental radii of closed-shell nuclei.
is not
We found that the surface term, Vh(r),
compatible with our consistent adjustment,
the
reason is that this term has a very small eﬀect on
single-particle spectra.

For 22Mg, 26Al and 26Si, the results on δRO ob-
tained stayed close to those obtained by Towner and

−

Hardy in 2002, where the same model space was ex-
ploited. All of our models produced smaller values
for 30S, we suppose that this discrepancy is due to
the diﬀerence in the cut-oﬀ for intermediate states.
In the cases of 34Cl, 34Ar, 38K and 38Ca, the correc-
tion is strongly dependent on the method for ﬁtting
the experimental data.

F

The calculated correction, δRO, combined with the
radiative corrections (δ′
R and δN S) and experimental
f t values as surveyed in Ref. [2] leads to six new sets
of corrected
t values. Most of these values are not
concordant with the weighted averages for the six
data points with a conﬁdence level of
0%. Nev-
ertheless, the scatter is much reduced for the values
resulting from the calculations that include the sur-
face term, Vg(r), the calculation based on the BMm
parametrization has a conﬁdence level of 38% and
within the SWV parametrization we obtained a con-
ﬁdence level of 81%.

∼

F

Within the assumption that CVC is valid, we per-
formed the analysis considering the
t value as an
adjustable parameter and minimizing the scatter be-
tween the calculated values of δRO and the pseudo-
experimental values. This analysis shows that all
sets of the correction generated by WS eigenfunc-
tions agree well with the CVC hypothesis. However,
it is most likely due to the lack of emitters under
consideration.

→

It will be interesting to perform a similar study
of lighter and heavier 0+
0+ emitters, as well
as to enlarge the model space for nuclei near the
cross shell using large-scale calculations. The aim
is to explore the sensitivity of the results to details
of the theoretical method and to robustly assign the
corresponding uncertainties. The importance stems
from the relevance for the most accurate tests of the
Standard Model of electroweak interactions.

Table V. Results of the calculations with full parentage expansion are tabulated with BMm-I, SWV-I, BMm-II,
SWV-II, BMm-IIG and SWV-IIG (see section V for detail). Results obtained in our preliminary study, which did not
include the multiple-intermediate states are denoted by BMm and SWV. These results correspond to those illustrated
in Fig. 2. The values taken from Ref. [1] and from Ref. [3] (with partial updates from Ref. [2]) are reported with the
label TH2002 and TH2008 respectively.
