The angstrom-scale coherence length describing the superﬂuid wavefunction of 4He at low tem-
peratures has prevented its preparation in a truly one-dimensional geometry. Mesoporous ordered
silica-based structures, such as the molecular sieve MCM-41, oﬀer a promising avenue towards phys-
ical conﬁnement, but the minimal pore diameters that can be chemically synthesized have proven
to be too large to reach the quasi-one-dimensional limit. We present an active nano-engineering
approach to this problem by pre-plating MCM-41 with a single, well controlled layer of Ar gas
before ﬁlling the pores with helium. The structure inside the pore is investigated via experimental
adsorption isotherms and neutron scattering measurements that are in agreement with large scale
quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate angstrom and kelvin scale tunability of
the eﬀective conﬁnement potential experienced by 4He atoms inside the MCM-41, with the Ar layer
reducing the diameter of the conﬁning media into a regime where a number of solid layers surround
a one-dimensional quantum liquid.

INTRODUCTION

The spatial dimension of a quantum many-body sys-
tem can be systematically controlled by applying con-
ﬁnement on a scale smaller than the length characteriz-
ing coherence of the wavefunction. In this manner, one-
dimensional (1D) phenomena have been explored in car-
bon nanotubes1–3, and low-density electronic quantum
wires4–7, where electron-beam lithography can achieve
transverse conﬁnement in the 10 nm to 100 nm range re-
quired to be smaller than the inverse Fermi wavevec-
tor. In ultra-cold atomic systems, laser trapping can pro-
duce conﬁnement on the scale of the thermal de Broglie
wavelength8–14. At higher densities, coherent quantum
phenomena in the elemental superﬂuid 4He is character-
ized by a length scale ξ(T ) ≈ 1 nm below the superﬂuid
transition temperature T < Tλ (cid:39) 2.12 K and engineering
1D conﬁnement at this sub-nanometer scale has turned
out to be a challenging task.

Current approaches to the physical conﬁnement of su-
perﬂuid helium fall into two categories: nanofabrication
and chemical synthesis.
In the ﬁrst, electron beams
have been employed to carve single short (L < 50 nm)
cylindrical pores with radii R = 3 nm to 100 nm15–17
while heavy-ion bombardment of polymer foils can cre-
ate longer (L = 1 µm to 100 µm) and wider (R =
15 nm to 200 nm) channels18–20. In both cases, the mea-
sured hydrodynamics of the conﬁned superﬂuid indicates
deviations from bulk three dimensional pressure driven
ﬂow, providing evidence for a crossover towards the 1D
limit. The second approach invokes chemistry to syn-
thesize silicates such as MCM-41 (Mobil Composition of
Matter No. 41)21 and FSM-16 (Folded Sheet Material)22
that consist of regular networks of hexagonal or cylindri-
cal pores. When ﬁlled with helium, they are amenable to

bulk probes at low temperature and have provided a large
body of evidence on the eﬀects of enhanced thermal and
quantum ﬂuctuations on the superﬂuid state23–38. How-
ever, the radii of the pores in these materials is ultimately
set by the speciﬁc reaction route and is not continuously
tunable, with the smallest possible diameter being on
the order of 2 nm. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations
of conﬁned 4He have indicated that sub-nm radii might
be required to observe truly 1D behavior39–44 and thus a
systematic approach to reducing the size of nanopores is
desirable to test these predictions.

In this paper, we introduce a proposed solution which
employs pre-plating MCM-41 nanopores with a single
adsorbed layer of argon gas45,46, thereby allowing tun-
ability of both the eﬀective pore radius seen by helium
atoms and the strength of the conﬁnement potential. We
combine experimental results employing N2 and 4He ad-
sorption isotherms with large scale quantum Monte Carlo
simulations to explore the atomic-scale structure within
the pores and identify a promising region where the den-
sity of a central core of helium atoms may be manipulated
upon ﬁlling.

A single nanopore of Ar pre-plated MCM-41 is mod-
elled by constructing an eﬀective conﬁnement potential
consisting of a superposition of Lennard-Jones terms for
He interacting with atoms in the porous material and a
single cylindrical shell of argon. The resulting potential
is tunable, both in terms of the location and depth of its
wall-proximate minima. Its speciﬁc form can be matched
to the microscopic geometry by extracting the width and
density of the argon layer via a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
(BET) analysis47 of experimental adsorption isotherms.
Once ﬁxed, this potential is employed in a grand canon-
ical quantum simulation of helium inside the nanopore
where the density can be tuned by modifying the chem-

ical potential (corresponding to the pressure of an ex-
ternal reservoir). As the pressure is increased, a series
of concentric cylindrical layers form with the outer-most
shells near the Ar exhibiting solid-like behavior. As the
pressure approaches that of saturated vapor, the pores
become fully ﬁlled and exhibit a central column of he-
lium which may realize the desired 1D behavior. The
existence of a central column is not a generic eﬀect, but
is instead a result of the ratio of the pore radius and the
location of the mimima of the He - He interaction poten-
tial being close to an integer value. Careful analysis of
simulation data allows for the determination of the re-
lation between the linear density (number of atoms) in
the pore center and the external pressure showing a nar-
row window, 0.0718 Pa to 1.635 Pa at T = 1.6 K, where
a compressible 1D liquid can be expected inside the pre-
plated nanopores.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
We ﬁrst describe the experimental synthesis of MCM-
41 and our pre-plating procedure followed by a char-
acterization of the nanoporous materials via adsorption
isotherms, elastic neutron scattering, and inelastic neu-
tron scattering. The results allow us to extract material
parameters that are essential in the construction of the
model pre-plated MCM-41 conﬁnement potential that is
employed in a quantum Monte Carlo methodology based
on path integrals. We next present the results of numer-
ical simulations detailing the structure inside the pore as
the external pressure is increased. We conclude with an
analysis of the resulting layer formation and discuss im-
plications for the discovery of a tunable 1D liquid in this
geometry.

II. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. Sample Characterization

MCM-41 is a mesoporous material with a hierarchical
structure produced using a surfactant templating tech-
nique. The surfactants used form rod-like micelles that
order in a hexagonal array. The pores of this material, af-
ter removal of the surfactant template, are monodisperse,
unidirectional, and have a regular 2D hexagonal struc-
ture. The typical aspect ratio of the pores is ∼ 1000 : 1.
Our sample was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich48 and
was characterized using X-ray powder diﬀraction and
N2 gas adsorption isotherm measurements. The X-ray
diﬀraction data indicated that the sample consisted of a
single phase with pores arranged on a hexagonal lattice
with a lattice constant of 4.7 nm. A Brunauer-Emmett-
Teller (BET) analysis49 of the N2 isotherm gave a surface
area of 915 m2/g. The pore diameter size distribution was
calculated using the Kruk-Jaroniec-Sayari method50 and
was found to be Gaussian with a mean value of 3.0 nm
and a full-width at half-maximum of 0.3 nm.

Adsorption isotherms were also carried out with re-
search grade Ar gas to determine the monolayer coverage

2

for the pores at 90 K. The results are shown in Figure 1.
A BET analysis of the isotherm yielded a monolayer cov-
erage of 8.994 mmol/g. This monolayer coverage, when
combined with the measured surface area, yields an aerial
coverage of 0.59 (cid:6)A
and, using the van der Waals radius
for Ar, a monolayer density of nAr = 0.017 (cid:6)A

sample collected under two diﬀerent conditions. The pur-
ple circles indicate the amount of argon adsorbed on the un-
treated material as a function of pressure at a ﬁxed temper-
ature of 90 K. Green squares illustrate the adsorption behav-
ior of 4He at 4.2 K on to MCM-41 already pre-plated with a
monolayer of Ar gas. Here P0 is the bulk equilibrium vapor
pressure of Ar (4He) for the purple circles (green squares).

B.

4He Isotherms

We also carried out 4He isotherms on MCM-41 pre-
plated with a single monolayer of Ar. The Ar pre-plating
was carried out at 90 K and then the sample was slowly
4He
cooled to 4.2 K over the course of several hours.
isotherms were then carried out at 4.2 K using standard
volumetric techniques. The results are shown in Figure 1.
The 4He initially adsorbed is strongly bound to the sur-
face resulting in zero pressure rise until ∼ 7.5 mmol/g
has been adsorbed. There is a small region between
∼ 7.5 mmol/g and 13 mmol/g where the pressure in-
creases. Once a ﬁlling of 13 mmol/g has been reached
no additional helium is adsorbed into the pores until the
pressure is close to the bulk vapor pressure. Once P/P0
is greater than ∼ 0.9, 4He capillary condenses between
the MCM-41 grains.

C. Neutron Scattering

Neutron scattering studies of 4He in Ar preplated
MCM-41 were performed to identify the phase (mo-
bile versus immobile) of the adsorbed helium. These
measurements were carried out using the Disc Chopper
Spectrometer (DCS) at the NIST Center for Neutron

Research51. This instrument is a direct geometry time-
of-ﬂight chopper spectrometer which views a cold mod-
erator. An incident wavelength of 2.5 (cid:6)A
was used for
these measurements. A top-loading liquid helium cryo-
stat with aluminum tails, commonly referred to as an “or-
ange” cryostat, was used to obtain the low temperatures
examined in this study. The sample cell was a cylindrical
aluminum can of outer diameter 1.5 cm, a height of 6 cm,
and a wall thickness of 1 mm. The cell contained 6.13 g
of MCM-41 in the form of cylindrical pellets 1 cm thick
separated by cadmium spacers to reduce multiple scat-
tering. Gas was loaded to the sample in situ from an ex-
ternal gas handling system. Measurements were carried
out at a temperature of 1.6 K. Standard data reduction
routines52 were used to convert the observed scattering
to the dynamic structure factor S(Q, E).

The sample was preplated with a monolayer of Ar
prior to the adsorbing 4He. The scattering from the
cell, MCM-41, and Ar monolayer were treated as back-
ground and subtracted from the results shown in Fig-
ure 2. The three panels show scattering at three diﬀer-
ent ﬁllings corresponding to (top) monolayer, (middle)
bilayer, and (bottom) full pore. For the purposes of this
discussion, we are only interested in the information the
scattering provides on the mobility of the adsobed he-
lium. A more complete analysis of the scattering will be
presented elsewhere. For the monolayer and bilayer, only
elastic scattering (E = 0) is observed. The strong scat-
tering at ∼ 2.5 (cid:6)A
represents the ﬁrst peak in the static
structure factor S(Q) for the adsorbed helium. The full
pore measurement, in contrast, exhibits inelastic scatter-
ing consistent with mobile 4He atoms.

−1

The lack of inelastic scattering for the monolayer and
bilayer indicate that when 4He is initially adsorbed on
the Ar plated MCM-41 pores it is strongly bound and
immobile. This is consistent with the predictions of the
simulations (discussed below) which predict high density
solid like layer formation for the ﬁrst few layers of 4He
adsorbed in the pores. The appearance of both elas-
tic scattering and inelastic scattering for the nearly full
pores is consistent with the simulation results that pre-
dict mobile (low density) helium at the center of the pores
surrounded by multiple solid layers.

side MCM-41 that has been pre-plated with a single layer
of Ar at 1.6 K. The scattering from the cell, MCM-41, and
the Ar layer have been subtracted. The panels from top to
bottom show results for pore ﬁllings 4.0 mmol/g, 6.8 mmol/g,
and 12.1 mmol/g and correspond to a single layer, double
layer, and a completely ﬁlled pore. The mostly elastic scat-
tering in the top and middle panel demonstrate the quasi-
two-dimensional solid-like behavior of the adsorbed helium
near the argon layer, while the dispersing inelastic intensity
emerging from |Q| (cid:39) 2 (cid:6)A supports the existence of a liquid
supporting density-wave excitations at the center of the pore.

III. MODEL AND SIMULATION DETAILS

The data obtained from the above experimental char-
acterization of the Ar pre-plated MCM-41 nanopores can
now be used to construct a theoretical model of the con-
ﬁnement geometry. We begin by simplifying the analysis
to a single pore, as their center-to-center separation of
4.7 nm means that atoms in diﬀerent pores are essen-
tially non-interacting. The one-pore system can then be

described by the N -body Hamiltonian:

mation now proceeds by generalizing previous results for
the conﬁnement of helium inside a cylinder carved out of
an inﬁnite homogeneous medium56–59.

We begin by considering the potential environment for
a 4He atom inside a single pore. Figure 3 shows a bird’s-
eye view of the structure of MCM-41 (z-axis points out of
the page) obtained via density functional theory60. The
atomic coordinates have been shifted such that the ori-
gin (0, 0, 0) is deﬁned to be at the center of a pore (as
indicated by the star). The black circle describes a per-
fect cylinder with radius R = 15.51 (cid:6)A constructed to ﬁt
within the quasi-hexagonal pores. This value is in agree-
ment with the average pore radii of MCM-41 extracted
from a BET analysis of experimental data. The result-
ing conﬁnement potential for a helium atom at position
ri is then formed from the usual sum over Lennard-Jones
pair-wise contributions:

The brute-force sum over j can be extended to a large
number of unit cells to obtain convergence to some ﬁxed
numerical precision with details, including all Lennard-
Jones parameters, described in Appendix A. The result
for a single slice at z = 0.0 (cid:6)A is shown in Figure 4
where the potential has only been plotted in the range
−200 K ≤ UMCM41(x, y, z = 0)/kB ≤ 200 K. In the deep
pockets near the pore walls indicated in the ﬁgure, the
depth of the well can drop to nearly −800 K for some
values of z. We expect that upon pre-plating the MCM-
41 with a light rare gas such as argon, these recesses
will be completely ﬁlled via adsorption eﬀects. Thus the
resulting potential seen by helium will be considerably
smoother. Motivated by this, we model the conﬁnement
potential felt by a helium atom at radius r from the cen-
ter of a pore using a radially symmetric eﬀective potential
inside a long uniform cylinder of radius R carved inside
a continuous media58. The resulting potential is now a

The values of σ, nε, and R in Eq. (4) can be extracted
through a non-linear least squares ﬁtting procedure of
UMCM41 to Ucyl as described in Appendix A. The result-
ing quantities are reported in Table I for helium inside
MCM-41.

With an eﬀective potential described by Eq. (4) for he-
lium inside MCM-41 we can now model the rare gas pre-
plating by superimposing a continuous cylindrical shell
with of width w = Rout − Rin that yields additional con-
ﬁnement

Ucyl and Rin = 11.75 (cid:6)A is the inner radius using the van

Jones parameters can be computed from the values in
Table II.

The full interaction potential U (r) = Ucyl(r)+Ushell(r)
for helium inside the Ar pre-plated MCM-41 system is

with MCM-41, Ucyl, is shown for comparison. We observe
that the density of the plated layer aﬀects both the depth
of the well and the location of the minimum, with this re-

density of the pre-plating layer provide substantial tune-
ability of the scale of the conﬁnement potential seen by
helium atoms while only producing a sub-(cid:6)A modiﬁcation
of its eﬀective radius. This indicates that substantially
diﬀerent levels of conﬁnement can be produced by mod-
ifying the species of rare gas when pre-plating. With an
estimate of the environment inside a single Ar preplated

simulation of conﬁned liquid helium at low temperature.

B. Quantum Monte Carlo

A system of N helium atoms described by Eq. (1)
inside the pore can be simulated using a Monte Carlo
technique that exploits the path integral representation
to map the quantum system in D = 3 spatial dimen-
sions to an eﬀective classical one in D + 1 = 4 that
can be eﬃciently sampled using the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm64. A grand canonical worm algorithm suit-
able for bosons in the spatial continuum introduced by
Boninsegni, Prokof’ev and Svistunov65,66 provides access
to ﬁnite temperature observables: (cid:104)O(cid:105) ∝ Tr O e−H/kBT
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, for systems com-
posed of a few thousand 4He atoms.

All results presented herein utilized our open source
path integral quantum Monte Carlo code in the grand
canonical ensemble (access details in Ref. [67]) and all
code, scripts, and data used in analysis and plotting are
available online68.

We considered pores of lengths L = 25 (cid:6)A to 100 (cid:6)A in
order to understand any ﬁnite size eﬀects (Appendix B 1),
and focused on chemical potentials in the range µ/kB =
−100 K to 0 K at two experimentally studied tempera-
tures: T = 4.2 K and 1.6 K. The imaginary time step
was ﬁxed at kBτ = 0.004 K−1 after comparing system-
atic Trotter and statistical errors for this value (see Ap-
pendix B 2).

In order to make connections between simulations and
experiment we can convert the chemical potential (simu-
lation tuning parameter) to pressure (experimental con-
trol knob). This was achieved by employing the virial
equation of state up to second order using the known
temperature dependence of the second coeﬃcient B2(T )
for bulk 4He at saturated vapor pressure69 which yields

the saturated vapor pressure of bulk helium, P0, and
is used throughout this work to convert between chem-
ical potential and pressure. The pure exponential de-
pendence holds over nearly the entire range of chemical
potentials with deviations appearing when P (cid:39) P0. A
more accurate ab initio estimation of the pressure inside
the pore can be obtained via quantum Monte Carlo64.
However, the eﬀective phase separation inside the pore
(see Section IV) makes statistical convergence of results
diﬃcult to obtain and we thus use the bulk relationship
here. This simpliﬁcation could introduce uncertainties
when comparing with experimental results manifested as
a pressure oﬀset that can be overcome by ﬁxing either
the onset (initial) or saturation (maximal) ﬁlling of the
pores.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

All results presented in this section for 4He inside Ar
plated MCM-41 have a ﬁxed pore length of L = 50 (cid:6)A,
pore radius R = 15.51 (cid:6)A, and employ U (r) described
in Section III A in the grand canonical ensemble yielding
N ≈ 600 helium atoms for the largest chemical potentials
studied.

A separate simulation was performed for each chemical
potential µ/kB in the range −100 K to −7 K at T = 1.6 K
and −100 K to 0 K at T = 4.2 K in steps of 1 K. The
number density ρ = N/V where V = πR2L is the vol-
ume of the pore, was computed with the results shown in
Figure 7. The adsorption isotherms demonstrate that the
pore remains empty until a temperature-dependent criti-
cal chemical potential is reached and atoms start to enter

step-like features indicative of layer formation consistent

has been converted to pressure via Eq. (6). The onset of
well-deﬁned peaks in the radial density correspond to the
steps in Figure 7. At low pressure, a quasi-solid layer of
helium forms near the hard wall created by the pre-plated
argon shell. As the pressure is increased, a sequence of
concentric quasi-2D shells form with near vacuum be-
tween them. The magnitude of the number density of
the shells places them all within the quasi-solid regime
for 4He.

When P is increased beyond 10−3P0 (µ/kB (cid:38) −17 K),
4He atoms begin to ﬁll an inner core. The insets of Fig. 8
show the density at the location of the ﬁrst minimum nor-
malized by the radial density at the center of the pore.
While there is an intermediate range of pressures where
atoms can move freely between the center of the pore and
ﬁrst shell, the density at the minima begins to drop pre-
cipitously at higher pressures. For P > 10−2P0 the den-
sity between the inner core and ﬁrst shell is vanishingly
small and particle exchanges are strongly suppressed in-
dicating that the core region is acting as a quasi-1D sys-
tem.

We note that the existence of this central core is not a
generic eﬀect and represents the fact that in the geome-
try considered here, the ratio of the eﬀective pore-radius
(set by the MCM-41 and Ar pre-plating geometry) to
the distance between shells (set by the helium interac-
tion potential) is approaching an integer. In nanopores
where the eﬀective radii is diﬀerent, the density of the
central core can be vanishingly small39,40.

We now focus on the details of the central core and
shells which can be characterized by one- and two-

lium atom (2.8 (cid:6)A) with over 95% of atoms falling within
this diameter when µ/kB > −17 K at both temperatures
studied. Moreover, the ﬁnal column of the table reports
the radial density at the location of the ﬁrst minima and
shows it 100× smaller than that in the center of the pore.
These combined results represents strong evidence for the
quasi-1D nature of the central core.

Evaluating Eqs. (8)–(9) inside the pore we observe a
strong pressure and temperature dependence of both the
1D linear and 2D coverage densities of the inner core and
surrounding shells as seen in Figure 9. At T = 1.6 K, the
inner core begins to ﬁll at lower pressures (P (cid:39) 10−5P0)
and we ﬁrst observe an increase in linear density which is
due to the leakage of particles from the ﬁrst shell as seen
in the lower panel of Figure 8. As the pressure is further
increased, the density between the inner core and ﬁrst
shell begins to reduce and the quasi-1D nature of the cen-
tral core becomes more apparent. It is in this regime that
we ﬁnd a decade of pressures (10−3P0 < P < 10−2P0)
where the inner core has a density equivalent to liquid
4He as indicated by the shaded bar in Figure 9. Fur-
ther increasing the pressure appears to quasi-solidify the
core which is consistent with the expectation that atoms
in 1D at high densities will seek to ﬁx the distance be-
tween them to minimize their interaction potential V (r).

ties at higher temperature.

information on the structure of 4He inside small con-
strictions. A BET analysis of experimental adsorption
isotherms was used to determine the average pore radii of
the grown MCM-41 (∼ 3 nm) and the density of a single-
layer of adsorbed Ar gas (0.017 (cid:6)A
). These values were
employed to build an eﬀective model of the pre-plated
adsorption potential which describes an inﬁnite cylin-
drical cavity carved inside a continuous Lennard-Jones
medium. While it is clear from the crystal structure and
resulting full conﬁnement potential shown in Figures 3
and 4 that the atomic structure of bare MCM-41 pro-
duces a rough potential landscape, it is assumed that the
pre-plating Ar gas will be ﬁrst adsorbed into the deep po-
tential pockets and resulting in a considerably smoothed
environment. This is justiﬁed by the agreement between
experimental and theoretical adsorption isotherms seen
in Figure 7. One of the main sources of uncertainty in
this work is the conversion between the chemical poten-

partial pressure (controlled in the experiments). It is ex-
pected that improvements could be made by implement-
ing a direct Monte Carlo estimator for the pressure inside
the nanopores combined with more sensitive determina-
tion of the pressure in the adsorption cell.

As discussed in the introduction and validated in §II
and §IV,
in this low-pressure regime, 4He atoms are
strongly attracted to the pre-plated walls of the MCM-
41 constriction and a quasi-2d solid layer adsorbs on the
surface, consistent with the scattering measurements at
4.0 mmol/g and 6.8 mmol/g in Figure 2. The Ar layer
has two main eﬀects: (1) its weaker interaction with he-
lium as compared to the MCM-41 reduces the potential
well depth (this can be controlled via the density of the
Ar layer); (2) the hard-cores of the Ar atoms decrease
the eﬀective radius of the constriction from 15.5 (cid:6)A to
∼ 11.75 (cid:6)A. We note that this is the exact reduction pre-
dicted from numerical simulations to ensure a cross-over
from a quasi-3D to quasi-1D superﬂuid39,41,44. Diﬀerent
conﬁnement radii and potential environments could be
obtained by changing the type of pre-plating rare gas,
and these techniques could be utilized with other porous
materials providing the opportunity to engineer a tar-
geted conﬁnement potential.

As the partial pressure of helium is further increased,
a series of concentric shells form separated by rm (cid:39) 3 (cid:6)A,
the distance at which two helium atoms in free space
would like to be situated to minimize their interaction en-
ergy. Shells near the Ar layer contain immobile helium,
while those nearer the center of the pore may exhibit
liquid-like behavior, consistent with the scattering results
presented here. The existence of ﬁnite density at the cen-
ter of the pore is not guaranteed for a generic nanoporous
system, even at large pressures40,44, and requires that the
pre-plated pore radii is nearly commensurate with rm.
Again, numerical simulations have demonstrated that
this central core can exhibit superﬂuid behavior41,43,44
at temperatures lower than those considered here.

In conclusion, we have shown that theoretical simu-
lations of 4He inside Ar pre-plated MCM-41 nanopores
are in agreement with experimental adsorption and scat-
tering results, and demonstrate the ability to stabilize
a quasi-one-dimensional quantum liquid at low tempera-
ture with a tunable density at the center of the pores. It
is expected that such a 1D liquid should lack long-range
order, instead displaying algebraically decaying density
and phase correlations, even at zero temperature. This
behavior could be conﬁrmed in future work by further
analyzing the results of experimental neutron scattering
measurements along with quantum Monte Carlo calcula-
tions of the dynamical structure factor within the context
of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory.

Appendix A: Determination of Parameters for
Eﬀective MCM-41 Potential

Eq. (2) in Section III A describes the full many-body
potential experienced by a single 4He atom conﬁned in-
side the MCM-41 matrix as a superposition of standard
6–12 Lennard-Jones interactions. Here we have used
the optimized atomic coordinates available in Ref. [60]
and the potential was computed on a 40 (cid:6)A × 40 (cid:6)A pore-
centered grid in the xy-plane at 101 diﬀerent z values
from z = −6.1 (cid:6)A to z = 6.1 (cid:6)A. At each of the grid points,
we considered a semi-inﬁnite crystal by summing over re-
peated unit cells until convergence was achieved at double
ﬂoating point precision.

We performed an extensive search for the opti-
mal Lennard-Jones parameters εij and σij to use in
UMCM41(ri) and found that a large range has been pre-
viously reported with minimal consensus in the litera-
ture. This included parameters based on Drieding force
ﬁeld calculations applied to silica, both with and with-
out the eﬀects of interacting hydrogen atoms76–81, and
including a large variation of the interaction strength
(75 K ≤ ε/kB ≤ 230 K) of both oxygen and silicon in
the MCM-4182–87. We have chosen to employ an alter-
native set of parameters that derived from consistent va-
lence force ﬁeld calculations88,89 that have been designed
speciﬁcally for silicates and have been able to reproduce
experimentally observed crystal structures. The appro-

With the full potential calculated, we next obtained
the eﬀective potential Ucyl in Eq. (4) to be employed in
grand canonical quantum Monte Carlo simulations via a
non-linear least squares ﬁtting procedure at each value of
z. This is made diﬃcult by the inﬁnitely repulsive pore
walls and the proximate deep attractive minima. To over-
come these extremal values two alternative methods were
employed to obtain a well-behaved dataset over which to
ﬁt: a potential cutoﬀ selected spatial grid-points inside
the MCM-41 pore where UMCM41/kB ≤ 0.0 K, and a spa-
tial cutoﬀ where all points within a ﬁxed radius set by
the closest point to the center with UMCM41/kB = 0.0 K
were chosen. The resulting spatial regions over which ﬁts
were performed at z = 0.0 (cid:6)A are compared in Figure 10.
The potential cutoﬀ method more accurately captures
the pore roughness as seen in the ﬁgure, while the radial
cutoﬀ method provides an improved description of the
region of the pore (r < 12.4 (cid:6)A) where the helium atoms

along the pore. The thick red line corresponds to the dis-
played parameters used for this study.

will reside after the pre-plating has occurred.

The ﬁtting procedure from UMCM41 to Ucyl then pro-
ceeds by determining the optimal set of parameters σ, n(cid:15),
and R in Eq. (4) at each of the 101 z-slices between
z = −6.1 (cid:6)A to 6.1 (cid:6)A. The resulting smooth symmetric
conﬁnement potentials for both methods are shown in
Figure 11. Upon comparison, it is clear that the raw
potential cutoﬀ does not provide a reasonable eﬀective
potential as it predicts a conﬁnement radius that is in-
consistent with experimental adsorption isotherms. This
is due to the fact that it is over-ﬁtting to the large po-
tential well depths within the rough areas of the pore
and neglecting the smoother lower potential region closer
to the center where the 4He will be conﬁned. As men-
tioned above, upon pre-plating we expect these volumes
to be ﬁlled by Ar and result in a considerably smoother
potential with a smaller eﬀective radius. This is better-
captured by the radial cutoﬀ method which also produces
an eﬀective conﬁnement radius that is in excellent agree-
ment with the experimentally determined pore diameter.
We thus focus on the results of the radial cutoﬀ approach
and determine the ﬁnal set of parameters by performing a
weighted average over the z-slices and choosing a value of
n(cid:15) that incorporates the expected added density of argon
due to its ﬁlling the extremal regions causing a deeper
potential well. The resulting eﬀective potential Ucyl is
shown as a red solid line in Figure 10 along with the pa-
rameters, which are also reported in Table I. We note
that there is considerable ambiguity in this procedure
and appeal to the reasonable agreement found between
theoretical and experimental results reported in §IV. A
more microscopic characterization of the helium–MCM-
41 interaction combing classical grand canonical Monte
Carlo with molecular dynamics simulations is ongoing,
but is beyond the scope of this study.

pores leading to a decay in the observed density oscilla-
tions. Finally, the total density of the 4He atoms inside
the pore comes with its own ﬁnite size errors due to the
1/N scaling of the chemical potential µ (see Ref. [90])
which has not been considered here. Correcting for this
would require the comparison of simulations performed
at diﬀerent length-dependent chemical potentials.

2. Trotter Error

Path integral quantum Monte Carlo is stochastically
exact at ﬁnite temperature, up to a systematic ﬁnite-time
step (Trotter) error that can be controlled through an
appropriate implementation of a composite factorization
scheme for the density matrix91. Here we use a O(τ 4)
approach for the He-He interaction, but are limited to a
primitive O(τ 2) approximation for the conﬁnement po-
tential. The resulting eﬀect on simulation results can be
seen in Figure 14, which shows the energy per particle of
4He inside Ar pre-plated MCM-41 as a function of imag-
inary time step τ at T = 1.6 K. The simulation data is
well ﬁt by a quadratic polynomial in τ as shown by the
solid line. The extrapolation of τ → 0 is within 1% of
the value at τ = 1/250 K−1 (vertical dotted line) that we
have utilized for all reported results to balance accuracy
with simulation eﬃciency.

L ≥ 50 (cid:6)A, the location of adsorbed shells (peaks) and the
minima between layers are mostly unaﬀected by the ﬁnite
pore length.

Appendix B: Simulation Scaling

1. Finite Size Eﬀects

To understand the eﬀects of ﬁnite pore length, we per-
formed grand canonical quantum path integral Monte
Carlo simulations for helium conﬁned within argon pre-
plated MCM-41 with L = 25.0 (cid:6)A to 100 (cid:6)A. Maximal ef-
fects were observed when the pore was completely ﬁlled
with µ/kB = −13.0 K at T = 1.6 K. Figure 12 shows
that there is little structural change, as captured by the
radial density with only minimal shifts of the peak den-
sities and minima between layers. As we are most inter-
ested in the 4He conﬁned at the very center of the pore,
we can quantify these eﬀects by studying the length de-
pendence of ρrad(r = 0) as well as the integrated linear
density ρ1D deﬁned in Eq. (8) as seen in Figure 13 for
the same set of simulation parameters. On this reduced
scale, the ﬁnite size eﬀects are more striking and exhibit
non-monotonic oscillatory behavior. This can be under-
stood as the conﬂuence of diﬀerent but related ﬁnite size
eﬀects. For L = 25 (cid:6)A, the aspect ratio of the pore is
∼ 1 : 1 and its length can accommodate approximately 6
helium atoms at its center. Such a small system can not
be expected to capture the physics in the thermodynamic
limit. As L is increased, there are oscillations caused by
the interplay between the length and the optimal inter-
particle separation rm (cid:39) 3 (cid:6)A set by the He-He interaction
as only an integer number of atoms can ﬁt in the center
of the pore. This eﬀect becomes less important for longer
