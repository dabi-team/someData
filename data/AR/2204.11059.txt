We present the results of fast spectrophotometry of ﬂares on the RS CVn-type star AR Lac with a time resolution
of 34 s and a spectroscopic resolution R ∼ 1300. The observations were performed on July 21-22, 2021 with the
2.0 m Karl Zeiss telescope at the Terskol Observatory. During the ﬂares, an additional emission appeared in the
spectrum of AR Lac at wavelengths nearby Ca II H&K (λ = 3933, 3968 Å), nearby Si IV lines (λ = 4089, 4116 Å).
Variations in these lines range from 2 to 5%. We have estimated the UBV magnitudes from spectrograms through
a mathematical convolution of the spectra with the ﬁlter transmission curves. The ﬂare amplitudes in the UBV
band up to 0.8 magnitudes were discovered. A detailed colorimetric analysis has allowed important parameters of
the ﬂares on AR Lac to be estimated: the temperatures at maximum light and their sizes. The color-color (U − B)
- (B − V ) diagrams conﬁrm that all the ﬂares at maximum light radiate as a blackbody. The temperatures at
maximum light were up to 12000 ± 300 K. Based on our colorimetric analysis, we have estimated the linear sizes
of the ﬂares at maximum light. The linear size of the ﬂares at the maximum luminosity is approximately 2% of the
radius of the star.

introduction

As presented in Berdyugina’s review [2], RS CVn stars represent a class of close detached binaries with
the more massive primary component being a G-K giant or subgiant and the secondary a subgiant or dwarf
of spectral classes G to M. They show optical variability interpreted as the rotationally modulated eﬀect of
cool spots on their surfaces. The primary appears more active than the secondary. Since they are tidally
locked close binaries, they are also fast rotators.

Thus, similar to other cool active stars, RS CVn-type variables are remarkable due to strong chromospheric
plages, coronal X-ray, and microwave emissions, as well as strong ﬂares in the optical, UV, radio, and X-ray.
Large amplitude brightness variations of RS CVn stars imply the presence of enormous starspots on their
surfaces covering up to 50% of the visible disc. Remarkable activity and high luminosity of these stars make
them favourite targets for light curve modelling, Doppler imaging and spectral line analysis. Most of the
present knowledge on starspots is based on studies of this type stars.

The totally eclipsing binary AR Lac (HD 210334, BD+4 53813) is a well known RS CVn double-lined
system whose components, a G2 IV and a K0 IV star, show signatures of an in tense solar-like activity (see
eg. Lanza et al. [6] and references therein).

The light curve solution made by Lanza et al. [6] supports the existence of compact starspots on the G2

IV primary star.

Several ﬂare events have been observed on AR Lac in various spectral regions from radio [9] to X-ray
[8], [10] including UV and EUV chromospheric and transition region lines [7], [12]. The ﬂare time-scales
generally range from a few hours to a few tens of hours. The long-lasting X-ray ﬂare observed by Ottmann &
Schmitt [8] had a total duration of about 20h, including two small events during the decay phase. Moreover,
the typical ﬂare light curve was followed by along-duration enhanced emission, lasting more than one orbital
period.

A high-cadence search was conducted on the known RS CVn-type ﬂare stars AR Lac, II Peg, and UX
Ari. Two optical ﬂares were observed in the B-band on AR Lac at 5 milliseconds (ms) resolution for a rate
of 0.04 ﬂare/hour. [4].

The ﬂare time-scales generally range from a few hours to a few tens of hours. In our work we present
results of optical ﬂare search on AR Lac on short time-scales. We demonstrate ﬂare events on time-scales of
minutes.

Observations and data processing

We collected a total of 198 spectra of the RS CVn star AR Lac on July 21-22, 2021 with the 2.0 m Karl Zeiss
telescope at the Terskol Observatory. The observations were obtained at the Cassegrain spectrograph with
intermediate resolution 1300 over the wavelength range 3500 - 5800 Å.

The ﬂat-ﬁeld spectra were obtained and subsequently averaged. We obtained the short "dark" spectra
after each exposure as well as "sky" spectra for subsequent processing. Pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations
were removed by dividing the stellar spectra by a mean ﬂat-ﬁeld spectrum assembled.

All the spectra collected were processed uniformly by means of programs in Interactive Data Language
(IDL). The baseline response of the CCD detector was subtracted from all the spectra by the acquisition
software at the Terskol Observatory.

To provide wavelength calibrations, we obtained spectra of the sky at the end of a night. The ﬁnal spectral

time series is represented by a two-dimensional array in-plane wavelength - time (Fig. 1).

Fig. 2 shows the white light curve of AR Lac as a wavelength-coordinate sum. One has clearly seen ﬂare

events lasting from half a minute to ﬁve minutes for a rate of 6 ﬂare/hour on an average.

In Fig. 4 we can see the peaks of activity at wavelengths nearby Ca II H&K (λ = 3933, 3968 Å), nearby
Si IV lines (λ = 4089, 4116 Å). The relative variations are equal to the ratio between the rms deviations in
the array of spectra and the average intensity of the spectrum. Variations in these lines range from 2 to 5%.
It is important to note the presence of activity in silicon Si IV lines (λ = 4089, 4116 Å). This indicates
the presence of hot plasma with a temperature above 10,000 K associated with ﬂares on the surface of a star.

Flare colorimetry

The modern approach to colorimetry is based on multicolor U BV RI spectrophotometry in the spectral
region from about of 3500 to approximately of 9000 Å. Colorimetry is a quantitative method for analyzing
radiation. It allows one to diagnose the radiation of a celestial body, determine the temperature, electron con-
centration, optical thickness of the emitting plasma based on theoretical diagnostic color diagrams calculated
for various radiation sources.

At ﬁrst, in each ﬁlter the intensities F U0, F B0, F V0 in a quiet state of a star were calculated in Fig. 3.
Then these values were subtracted from the corresponding values F U, F B, F V of the ﬂare intensities. Based
on the obtained residues, the color indices of the intrinsic emission of the ﬂare were determined:

where △U B = 0.26 + 2.5 lg
take into account the color indices of the star in a quiet state: U − B = 0.26, B − V = 0.72.

To develop two-color diagrams, we used the color indices of various radiation sources [11], [3]. The bright
area of the diagram (U − B) - (B − V ) in Fig. 5 corresponds to the color characteristics of a hydrogen plasma
that is optically thin in the Balmer continuum with Te ∼ 10000 K and Ne from 1014 to 1010 cm−3. The
dark region of the diagram corresponds to an optically thick plasma with Te from 15000 to 8000 K. Absolute
blackbody radiation is indicated by the bottom broken line.

Fig. 5 shows color tracks of the July 21-22, 2021 ﬂares on the (U - B)-(B - V) diagram. The 95% error
squares are shown. The squares mark ﬂare maxima. The color errors were calculated for Poissonian quantum
ﬂuxes.

The ﬂare luminosity in the U band can be determined by convolving the spectrum of a completely black

body with the transmission curve of the U ﬁlter. Flare area s can be deﬁned as [1]:

where S is the area of the visible disk of the star, △U is the amplitude of the ﬂare in the U band, F U0 and

Here U (λ) is the transmission curve of the U ﬁlter. Knowing the observed ﬂare amplitude in the U band,
the photosphere temperature of AR Lac (5039 K, [5]), and the temperature at the maximum of the ﬂare,
one can easily estimate the size of the ﬂare using the above formulas. The linear size of the ﬂares at the
maximum luminosity is approximately 2% of the radius of the star, or about 0.2% of the area of the visible
disk of the star.

The white light curve (Fig. 2) shows some periodicity in ﬂashes. The detrended light curve of AR Lac
(Fig. 6) shows a periodic "pilot signal", which control the ﬂares of a star. Its amplitude is small, several
thousandths of a magnitude in U-rays. We can see that all the ﬂares appear at the highs of the pilot signal.
This eﬀect is a new phenomenon that is not taken into account in modern theories of stellar ﬂares. For the
ﬁrst time periodic pilot signals have been detected in a quiet state of the ﬂaring star YZ CMi [13].

Conclusion

Flares on an RS CVn type star AR Lac are an example of fast processes. The brightness of a star and the
spectral composition of its radiation can change signiﬁcantly in fractions of a minute.

We performed a fast AR Lac spectrophotometry on July 21-22, 2021 using the 2.0-m Carl Zeiss telescope at
Terskol Observatory. The observations were obtained with a spectral resolution of R ∼ 1300; time resolution
34 s.

During the ﬂare, additional emission was detected in the Ca II H&K (λ = 3933, 3968 Å) and Si IV (λ =

4089, 4116 Å) lines. The excess of emissions is about two to ﬁve percent.

We estimated the UBV magnitudes of the ﬂares by mathematically convolving the spectra with the ﬁlter

transmission curves. UBV amplitudes reach 0.8 magnitudes.

From the color-color diagram (U-B)-(B-V) we found that the ﬂares at maximum brightness radiate as a
black body with a temperature of up to 12,000 ± 300 K. The linear size of the ﬂares is estimated at about
2% of the stellar radius.
