ABSTRACT

An X1.6 ﬂare occurred in AR 12192 on 2014 October 22 at 14:02 UT and was observed
by Hinode, IRIS, SDO, and RHESSI. We analyze a bright kernel which produces a white light
(WL) ﬂare with continuum enhancement and a hard X-ray (HXR) peak. Taking advantage of
the spectroscopic observations of IRIS and Hinode/EIS, we measure the temporal variation of
the plasma properties in the bright kernel in the chromosphere and corona. We found that
explosive evaporation was observed when the WL emission occurred, even though the intensity
enhancement in hotter lines is quite weak. The temporal correlation of the WL emission, HXR
peak, and evaporation ﬂows indicate that the WL emission was produced by accelerated electrons.
To understand the white light emission process, we calculated the energy ﬂux deposited by non-
thermal electrons (observed by RHESSI) and compared it to the dissipated energy estimated
from a chromospheric line (Mg II triplet) observed by IRIS. The deposited energy ﬂux from
the non-thermal electrons is about 3 ∼ 7.7 × 1010erg cm−2 s−1 for a given low energy cut-oﬀ of
30 ∼ 40 keV, assuming the thick target model. The energy ﬂux estimated from the temperature
changes in the chromosphere measured using the Mg II subordinate line is about 4.6 − 6.7 ×
109erg cm−2 s−1: ∼ 6 − 22% of the deposited energy. This comparison of estimated energy ﬂuxes
implies that the continuum enhancement was directly produced by the non-thermal electrons.

Introduction

Solar ﬂares are one of the most energetic en-
ergy release processes in the heliosphere. When a
ﬂare occurs we can observe the multi-wavelength
response from microwaves to X-rays such as ra-
dio bursts in the impulsive phase, Hα emission
along the ﬂare ribbons, soft X-ray emission in the
post ﬂare loop arcade, and hard X-ray emission at
the footpoints and looptop region (Fletcher et al.
2011).

Based on these multi-wavelength observa-
tions, several solar ﬂare models have been pro-
posed. The standard solar ﬂare model (CSHKP;
Carmichael (1964); Sturrock (1968); Hirayama
(1974); Kopp & Pneuman (1976)) proposes that
magnetic reconnection occurs at coronal heights
and the released magnetic energy is transported
the chro-
to the lower atmospheric layers (e.g.
mosphere) by thermal conduction (Nagai 1980;
Yokoyama & Shibata 2001), non-thermal particles
(Nagai & Emslie 1984; Fisher et al. 1985c,b,a), or
an Alfv´en wave poynting ﬂux (Fletcher & Hudson
2008). The transferred energy heats the plasma
and generates and overpressure in the lower at-
mosphere. Dense plasma is then evaporated to-
ward the corona along the magnetic ﬁeld (chro-
mospheric evaporation) and we then observe post
ﬂare loops emitting in the EUV and soft X-rays.
Sometimes strong ﬂares produce continuum en-
hancements as a photospheric response during the
impulsive phase of the ﬂare, and this is termed a
white light ﬂare (WLF) (Carrington 1859; ˇSvestka
1966). Previous observations in visible wave-
lengths and hard X-rays showed that the contin-
uum enhancement in WLFs is well correlated with
hard X-ray emission both spatially and temporally
(Neidig 1989; Hudson et al. 1992; Metcalf et al.
2003; Watanabe et al. 2010a; Krucker et al. 2015;
Kuhar et al. 2016). As a result of this correla-
tion, it has been thought that WLFs are produced
by the transported energy from accelerated parti-
cles such as non-thermal electrons (Brown 1971;
Hudson 1972).

With recent high spatial resolution observa-
tions, white light emission has been reported
(Matthews et al. 2003;
even in C-class ﬂares

Hudson et al. 2006). The electron ﬂux from these
low energy events is not enough to penetrate
and heat the photosphere directly. Therefore,
other heating mechanisms have also been consid-
ered. For example, Zirin & Neidig (1981) pro-
posed that high energy protons carry the energy,
and Machado et al. (1989) suggested that WL
emission is produced by electrons that heat the
chromosphere directly and the photosphere indi-
rectly through radiative backwarming. However,
the true heating mechanism in the lower atmo-
sphere remains unclear. We believe that under-
standing the ﬂare dynamics during the impulsive
phase, and the lower atmospheric response to the
ﬂare, are key to clarifying the heating and energy
transport processes.

From previous observational studies of chromo-
spheric evaporation, strong blue shifted emission
(> 100 km s−1) in coronal lines (Antonucci et al.
1982; Brosius 2003, 2009, 2013a,b; Milligan & Dennis
2009) and red asymmetries (40 − 100 km s−1)
in chromospheric lines

1984; Kamio et al. 2005; del Zanna et al. 2006)

have been found.
redshift in coronal
lines formed around a few
MK (Imada et al. 2008; Milligan & Dennis 2009;
Watanabe et al. 2010b), and direct imaging ob-
servations of chromospheric evaporation upﬂows
have been observed by Hinode/XRT (Nitta et al.
2012). Hydrodynamic simulations can re-produce
aspects of the observations and predict two diﬀer-
ent types of evaporative ﬂows depending on the
deposited energy ﬂux: ”explosive” and ”gentle”
evaporation (Fisher et al. 1985a,b,c).

Recently, the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrom-
eter (EIS, Culhane et al. (2007)) and Interface Re-
gion Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS, De Pontieu et al.
(2014)) have provided us with high spatial and
temporal resolution spectroscopic observations in
the EUV/UV (Li & Ding 2011; Tian et al. 2015;
Graham & Cauzzi 2015). The combined power
of the instruments allows us to investigate ﬂare
properties and dynamics through the entire at-
mospshere from chromosphere to corona (Li et al.
2015; Polito et al. 2015, 2016).

Most relevant to this work are several stud-
ies comparing the deposited ﬂare energy with ob-
served continuum enhancements. For example,
Watanabe et al. (2010a) found that the energy of
the white light emission observed by Hinode/Solar

Optical Telescope (SOT) was equivalent to the en-
ergy supplied by all the electrons accelerated to
above 40 keV, which suggests that highly acceler-
ated electrons are responsible for producing white
light emission. Recently, Kleint et al. (2016) in-
vestigated the radiated energy from the continuum
enhancement observed from the UV to IR during
a ﬂare using IRIS, Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO), and Facility Infrared Spectrometer (FIRS),
and also found that the deposited energy was suf-
ﬁcient to produce the UV and visible continuum
emission in the ﬂare.

(2015), Thalmann et al.

In this study, we describe the temporal evolu-
tion of the spectral properties and quantitatively
estimate the energy ﬂux of an X1.6 ﬂare using
combined observations from IRIS, EIS, Reuven
Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI, Lin et al. (2002)), and SDO. The whole
ﬂare evolution, from the beginning of the impul-
sive phase to the gradual phase, is captured by
these instruments simultaneously and the strong
ﬂare produces white light emission. Previously,
(2015), and
Li et al.
Veronig & Polanec (2015) also investigated this
well observed ﬂare using SDO, RHESSI and IRIS.
Thalmann et al. (2015) and Veronig & Polanec
(2015) mainly focused on the magnetic reconnec-
tion rates and the RHESSI HXR proﬁles of this
ﬂare, and Li et al. (2015) investigated the relation-
ship between Doppler velocity patterns derived
from IRIS Fe XXI and C I and the RHESSI HXR
intensity. Those studies showed that the ﬂare en-
ergy is injected into high energy electrons, and
that they could driver the evaporation ﬂow in the
ﬂare. We present the ﬂare observations from each
instrument in Section 2, and the temporal evolu-
tion of the spectral properties (intensity, Doppler
velocity, line width, density and temperature) of
the ﬂare kernel during the impulsive phase with
the other continuum and X-ray observations in
Section 3. We discuss the comparison between
the deposited energy from the non-thermal elec-
trons and the observed spectroscopic properties in
Section 4. A summary of our results is given in
Section 5.

2. Observations and data analysis

2.1. X1.6 ﬂare in AR 12192

We investigate an X1.6 ﬂare which occurred on
2014 October 22 in AR 12192. AR 12192 was the
largest active region in this solar cycle and it pro-
duced 6 X-class ﬂares and 31 M-class ﬂares. Fig-
ure 1 shows the GOES soft X-ray (0.5-4 ˚A and
1-8 ˚A) light curve, its time derivative, and the
RHESSI hard and soft X-ray light curves of the
ﬂare event. The ﬂare started at about 14:02 UT
and peaked at 14:28 UT. The gradual phase of the
ﬂare emission declined until an M-class ﬂare oc-
curred at 15:54 UT. The vertical dashed lines mark
the speciﬁc times at which we present the spec-
tral properties of the ﬂare: (a: the beginning of
the impulsive phase (14:06 UT), b: the rise phase
(14:09 UT), and c: the peak (14:24 UT); see sec-
tion 3). Positions a, b, and c also mark the peaks
of the time derivative of the soft X-ray curve which
correspond to the hard X-ray peaks (bottom), as
expected from the Neupert eﬀect (Neupert 1968).
Figure 2 shows context images of the ﬂare ob-
tained by SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA, Lemen et al. (2012)) in the 211 ˚A (a-c) and
1700 ˚A (e-g) channels, and IRIS C II 1330 ˚A slit
jaw images (SJIs) overlaid with EIS 195 ˚A con-
tours (panels i-k) for diﬀerent timings, before the
ﬂare (∼13:34 UT), the ﬁrst HXR peak (∼14:06
UT) and the SXR peak (∼14:24 UT). Panels (d)
and (h) display the SDO/Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager (HMI, Schou et al. (2012)) contin-
uum and a running diﬀerence image at the time
the white light ﬂare occurred, respectively. Panel
(l) shows the polarity inversion line from the HMI
magnetogram contoured on an IRIS SJI to show
the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration.

When we look at the continuum and lower at-
mospheric (AIA 1700 ˚A) images, we can see that
the ﬂare occurred at the boundary of the large
umbra and the satellite penumbra. When the ﬁrst
hard X-ray peak of the ﬂare was observed (around
14:06 UT), we can see continuum enhancements
(the white light ﬂare) at two bright kernels (panel
(h)) which correspond to the footpoints of the ﬂare
loop structure (panel (c)). Then, two ribbons ex-
tend in the east-west direction (panels (g) and
(k)). Before the ﬂare, around 13:34 UT (panels
(a), (e), and (i)), we can see a small brigtening
near the east side of the ﬂare kernel. This ker-

3

nel was observed simultaneously in the IRIS and
EIS scanning rasters. We analyzed the evolution
of the plasma properties of this bright kernel and
estimated the energy ﬂux.

2.2. Spectroscopic observations from Hin-

ode/EIS and IRIS

EIS captured the ﬂare with the study “HH Flare raster v6”

which ran from 13:01:56 UT to 15:56:56 UT. This
EIS study is designed for observing ﬂares using a
moderate cadence raster scan. The 2′′ slit scans
20 positions with a coarse 3′′ step between each
position and the ﬁeld of view is 59′′ × 152′′. The
exposure time at each position is 9 seconds and the
raster scan takes about 3.5 minutes. The study
has 12 spectral windows and we used 10 spectral
lines covering the temperature range from log T =
4.9-7.2. These are listed in Table 1. The spectral
resolution of the EIS is about 0.022 ˚A.

At the same time, IRIS was running a very large
coarse 8 step raster. It uses the 0.33′′ × 175′′ slit
and with 2′′ steps and so covers a ﬁeld of view of
about 14′′ × 175′′ in around 130 seconds. The ex-
posure time at each position is 16 seconds. The
spectral and spatial resolution of IRIS is 0.025 ˚A
and 0.32′′, respectively. The IRIS slit direction
was rotated 45 degrees relative to its center for
this observation. The observing program includes
9 spectral windows in the FUV (1332-1358 ˚A and
1389-1407 ˚A) and NUV (2783-2834 ˚A).
In this
study, we only analyze the spectral lines which
are close to optically thin, O I, Si IV, and Fe XXI,
for measuring the Doppler velocity, and used the
O IV and Mg II lines for investigating the chromo-
spheric response. The spectral lines we used are
summarized in Table 1.

To obtain the intensity, Doppler velocity, and
line width as a function of time, we ﬁtted the spec-
tral lines in Table 1 using single and multiple gaus-
sians. Figures 3 and 4 show examples of the line
proﬁles from EIS and IRIS, respectively. In Figure
3, the green solid line is the ﬁtted spectra and the
red dashed lines indicate each component of the
multiple Gaussian ﬁtting. The red and green dot-
ted vertical lines are the ﬁtted line center of each
spectral line component from a multiple Gaussian
ﬁtting, and the estimated velocities are written in
the Figure 3. To obtain a reference wavelength
for the EIS spectra, we measured the average line
centers before the ﬂare (between 13:01-13:51 UT),

4

and these are marked with vertical dashed lines.
In Figure 4, the green solid line is the ﬁtted spectra
and the dashed lines indicate each component of
the multiple Gaussian ﬁts. The red dashed ﬁtted
components are Fe XXI (in the upper panels) and
the second component of Si IV (in the lower pan-
els). The reference wavelengths for IRIS were de-
termined by taking the diﬀerence between the the-
oretical wavelengths and averaged observed wave-
lengths of O I 1355.60 ˚A and S I 1401.51 ˚A before
the ﬂare. These are marked by vertical dashed
lines in the Figure. The theoretical wavelength
of Fe XXI is taken from the CHIANTI atomic
database (Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al. 2012) and
is denoted by the vertical dot-dashed line.

2.3.

SDO and RHESSI observations

We also used AIA and HMI onboard SDO to
understand the global structure and magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁguration of the ﬂare. AIA provides multi-
ple temperature images covering log T = 3.7-7.2
with a high time cadence of about 12 seconds and
a spatial resolution of 1.2 arcsec. We used AIA
1700 ˚A and 211 ˚A ﬁlter images for context (Fig-
ure 2), and took advantage of the high temporal
resolution of AIA to investigate the ﬂare intensity
variations and compare them to what is observed
by EIS and IRIS. The temporal variation of the
intensity in diﬀerent AIA ﬁlters is plotted in Fig-
ure 5. HMI provides full Sun line of sight (LOS)
magnetograms and continuum images at a spatial
resolution of ∼ 1′′ and a temporal cadence of 45
seconds. Using the continuum data, we conﬁrmed
that the white light ﬂare kernel is coincident with
the same bright UV kernel we analyzed.

We also investigated the ﬂare hard and soft X-
ray emission using the RHESSI X-ray spectrome-
ter. We plotted the light curve of the emission in
the 30-100 keV and 12-25 keV range in Figure 1.
To obtain images of the HXR and SXR emission,
we used the ”Clean” method with 300 iterations
and a temporal resolution of 2 minutes, which is
similar to that of the IRIS raster. The left panel in
Figure 6 shows an HMI intensity diﬀerence image
with the cleaned RHESSI HXR and SXR intensity
contours (50, 60, 70, 80, and 90%) overlaid.

2.4. Co-alignment of SDO, Hinode/EIS, and

IRIS

We co-aligned the ﬂare observations from Hin-
ode, IRIS, RHESSI, and SDO as follows. First,
we used SDO/AIA observations as the reference
image and aligned the AIA 1600 ˚A image with the
IRIS SJI 1330 ˚A images. The IRIS slit was ro-
tated 45 degrees from the north-south direction,
so we de-rotated the SJI images and then aligned
them with the AIA images. Then, we aligned the
EIS Fe XII 195.12 ˚A raster images with AIA 193 ˚A
ﬁlter images. For this alignment we calculated the
oﬀset values using the procedure ‘align map.pro’
available in the Solar Software (SSW) package.
The oﬀset values vary within ∼2′′, and the EIS
and IRIS SJI images are overlaid in the bottom
panels of Figure 2.

3. Results

3.1. Temporal evolution of the continuum,
UV, and X-ray emission in the bright
kernel

We found that the white light ﬂare signature
of the bright kernel in the HMI images and the
HXR emission observed by RHESSI were located
at the same position (left panel in Figure 6). To
check the temporal evolution we plotted the light
curve of the HMI continuum intensity in the bot-
tom panel of Figure 7, and the HXR and SXR light
curves for the bright kernel location in the ﬁrst and
second rows. We also plotted the light curves for
the chromospheric and ﬂaring line intensities from
IRIS (O I, Si IV, Fe XXI) for comparison.

First, we note that the HXR peak and enhance-
ment of the chromospheric line intensity (O I) ap-
pear at the beginning of the ﬂare (∼14:04 UT).
Second, the continuum enhancement starts to ap-
pear around the same time and reaches its max-
imum within 2 minutes. Third, the SXR emis-
sion shows two borad humps, one near the HXR
peak time and another lower peak around 16 min-
utes later. This suggests that the heated plasma
was evaporated and the increased density and tem-
perature are observed as enhanced SXR emission.
Fourth, the emission from Fe XXI increases around
14:24 UT. We note that even although the inten-
sity of Fe XXI is weak, emission is detected at the
beginning of the ﬂare (14:04 ∼ 14:11 UT). It sug-

gests that the enhanced Fe XXI emission might
be caused by the density enhancement of the hot
plasma.

3.2. Temporal evolution of the spectral
properties of the bright kernel

3.2.1.

Intensity

Figures 5, 8, and 10 (upper panel) show the
temporal variation of the intensities of the bright
kernel at diﬀerent wavelengths from SDO, EIS,
and IRIS, respectively. The SDO/AIA intensities
in Figure 5 are normalized by their maximum in-
tensity during the period from 13:00 UT to 16:00
UT. Together EIS and IRIS provide the tempo-
ral variation of the intensity over a wide range of
temperature from log T=4.5 - 7.2.

From the intensity variation, we can see anal-
ogous behavior in certain temperature ranges, log
T= 4.5 - 5.8 (cooler), log T= 5.8 - 6.4 (middle),
and log T= 6.4 - 7.2 (hotter). It seems that the
temperature response of the ﬂare is similar in these
temperature ranges and transitions at log T∼ 5.8
and log T∼ 6.4. In the cooler temperature emis-
sion, such as 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A in Figure 5 or
He II or O V in Figure 8, the response of the ﬂare
is seen as a sharp intensity enhancement when the
ﬂare starts (time (a) in Figure 1) with no sig-
niﬁcant enhancement during the gradual phase.
For the hotter emission lines (e.g. Fe XXIV and
Fe XXIII), it seems that the intensities peak a lit-
tle later than in the cooler temperature lines and
there is a signiﬁcant intensity enhancement dur-
ing the gradual phase. In the middle temperature
range, e.g. Fe X - Fe XVI in Figure 8, there are
several peaks during the gradual phase. It seems
that after the main ﬂare, there are still bursts of
intensity enhancement albeit not strong enough to
produce white light or HXR emission.

3.2.2. Doppler velocity

The upper panel in Figure 9 and middle row
in Figure 10 show the temporal variation of the
Doppler velocity at diﬀerent wavelengths. The
most signiﬁcant velocity variation is seen at the
impulsive phase of the ﬂare around 14:06 UT. A
strong blue shift is observed in the ﬂaring tem-
perature lines, Fe XV - Fe XXIV, and a red shift
is observed in the chromospheric lines, O V and
Si IV, which is consistent with the Doppler veloc-

5

ity pattern expected from explosive evaporation
(Figures 3 and 9). After the impulsive phase the
blue shift in the higher temperature lines quickly
changes to a weak red shift which lasts more than
an hour; essentially until the hotter emission dis-
appears (Figure 10). A strong red shift is also
seen in the cooler temperature lines during the
impulsive phase and weak red-shifted emission is
observed during the gradual phase.

We plotted the velocity as a function of the line
formation temperature in Figure 11. Panels (a),
(b), and (c) show the velocity pattern before the
ﬂare, during the impulsive phase, and during the
gradual phase. The velocity pattern we discussed
is clearly seen in the Figure. Moreover, the veloc-
ity become larger at higher temperatures, which
is a similar behavior to what has been reported
previously by e.g. Milligan & Dennis (2009) and
Polito et al. (2016), and is consistent with theo-
retical expectations (Nagai & Emslie 1984).

We note that a strong blue shift was only ob-
served at the beginning of the ﬂare even though
the intensity enhancement in the hotter lines is
quite weak. Figure 10 shows that the Fe XXI in-
tensity from IRIS is weak, but the Doppler ve-
locity shows a strong outﬂow at the start time of
the ﬂare (∼ 14:06 UT). The EIS observations also
show that a strong blue shift is observed in the hot-
ter lines even when the intensity is weak (Figures
3 and 8). So, it appears that higher temperature
emission exists and we can observe the dynamics
even when there is no strong intensity signature.
The intensity may be weak because the density is
low in the high temperature plasma in the early
phase, which we tried to verify with density diag-
nostic measurements (see below).

3.2.3. Line width

We also checked the line width variation with
time, which is shown in the bottom panels of Fig-
ures 9 and 10. The strongest line width enhance-
ment was observed in the ﬂaring emission lines
(Fe XXI and Fe XXIII) at ∼14:06 UT when the
ﬁrst hard X-ray peak and Doppler velocity peak
in the hot plasma appears. We note that if the
emission has a bulk Doppler shifted velocity com-
ponent, it will make the line broader due to the
combination of the rest and moving component.
However, at the beginning of the ﬂare, the Doppler
velocity pattern of the lines can be ﬁtted with a

6

single gaussian, and the whole lines are blue or
red shifted without a rest component (see e.g. the
line proﬁles of Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV in Figure 3
and Fe XXI in Figure 4). This implies that the
enhanced line width at the beginning of the ﬂare
is related to non-thermal broadening, not Doppler
velocity.

The non-thermal broadening in UV and X-
ray emissions is usually regarded as a manifesta-
tion of unresolved mass motions of the plasma,
turbulence or waves
such as, multiple ﬂows,
(Alexander & MacKinnon 1993; Dere & Mason
1993; Chae et al. 1998; Hara et al. 2011; Kawate & Imada
2013). The signiﬁcant enhancement of the line
width and the HXR peak at the beginning of the
ﬂare are temporally well correlated. If the coronal
reconnection occurs at the HXR peak timing, or
the HXR comes from the accelerated electrons,
the non-thermal broadening possibly caused by
turbulence motion or waves due to the magnetic
reconnection or accelerated electrons.

There are several other peaks at diﬀerent times
in He II, Si IV and Fe XII that appear to be re-
lated to small chromospheric brightenings; one of
which may be a candidate for lower atmospheric
reconnection that triggers the ﬂare (Bamba et al.
2016).

3.2.4. Density

We measured the density of the bright kernel
in the chromosphere and corona during the ﬂare.
Assuming the plasma is optically thin, thermal,
and in collisional ionization equilibrium, we derive
the density using the intensity ratio of emission
lines from the allowed and forbidden transitions
which are sensitive to the density. The diagnostic
method is well described by Mariska (1992) and
Phillips et al. (2008).

The good density sensitive line pairs observed in
EIS and IRIS are reported in Young et al. (2007)
and Young (2015), respectively. We used the O IV
line pair for measuring the density in the transi-
tion region plasma, and the Fe XIV line pair for
the coronal plasma. Figure 12 shows the temporal
variation of the density measured by IRIS (upper
panel) and EIS (lower panel).

The O IV line pair (1399.77 ˚A and 1401.16 ˚A)
shows density sensitivity in the Log Ne = 10 − 13
range with an intensity ratio range of 0.17-0.43.

We plotted the intensity ratio with time rather
than the converted density because the inten-
sity ratio during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare
exceeds the maximum value of the theoretical
calculation. Therefore, we cannot measure the
density during the impulsive phase. Before and
after the impulsive phase, the averaged density
is about 6.3 × 1010 cm−3. The enhanced in-
tensity ratio during the impulsive phase implies
densities in excess of 1013 cm−3, which could
be the result of compression from the explo-
sive evaporation. Alternatively it could mean
that the plasma is not in ionization equilib-
rium (Kafatos & Tucker 1972; Imada et al. 2011;
Olluri et al. 2013; Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2016)
and therefore that the density measurements
are invalid during that period. However, the
ionization-relaxation time is only about 13 seconds
for a plasma with the average density measured
before and after the impulsive phase, which is
much shorter than the duration that the intensity
ratio was enhanced.

Another possibility is that the measured line
intensities are blended with cool lines which was
mentioned by Young (2015) and Polito et al.
(2016). For example, Fe II 1399.96 ˚A, S I 1401.51
˚A and unidentiﬁed lines at shorter wavelengths
are close to O IV. Even if we perform multiple
Gaussian ﬁtting to take these blended lines into
consideration, the intensity ratio is still enhanced
during the impulsive phase.

We measured the coronal density with EIS us-
ing the Fe XIV 264.79 ˚A and 274.20 ˚A line pair.
Compared to the results from O IV, Fe XIV shows
that the density is slightly enhanced in the early
phase of the ﬂare, then increases signiﬁcantly in
the later phase and peaks at the same time as the
SXR. The temporal variation of the density is sim-
ilar to the intensity variation, suggesting that the
low intensities observed when explosive evapora-
tion occurs are due to the low density of the higher
temperature plasma. After evaporation, intensity
enhancements can also be seen in the higher tem-
perature lines.

3.2.5. Chromospheric temperature: Mg II triplet

lines

We also checked the response of the chromo-
spheric Mg II line. Figure 13 shows the Mg II
line proﬁle and the green horizontal lines mark

7

the region we extracted for the spectral proﬁle.
The solid line shows the line proﬁle during the im-
pulsive phase (∼14:07) and the dotted line shows
the spectrum around 12:00 UT when there is no
speciﬁc brightening or X-ray response, as a ref-
erence. One interesting point to note is that the
Mg II triplet lines emit strongly during the im-
pulsive phase compared to during the non-ﬂaring
time.

Leenaarts et al. (2013) and Pereira et al. (2015)
proposed that Mg II h & k, and its subordinate
lines (a triplet: 2791.60 ˚A. 2798.75 ˚A, and 2798.82
˚A) can be used as diagnostic tools of the chromo-
spheric plasma. In particular, Pereira et al. (2015)
showed that the Mg II triplet blends at 2798.75
˚A and 2798.82 ˚A will be seen in emission when
chromospheric heating occurs, and the line core
to wing intensity ratio has a linear relationship
with the temperature increase.

We applied their quantitative method to inves-
tigate the temperature changes in this ﬂare kernel.
We measured the line core (the average intensity
between 2798.66-2798.93 ˚A) to wing (taken at the
2799.32 ˚A) intensity ratio of the two blended Mg II
triplet lines, 2798.75 ˚A and 2798.82 ˚A. The left
column in Figure 14 shows the variation of the in-
tensity ratio with time. We converted the intensity
ratio to ∆T from the linear relationship between
them derived from the ﬂare simulation conducted
by Pereira (private communication). The varia-
tion of ∆T with time is shown in the right column
of Figure 14. The estimated temperature changes
are about 3 kK for the ﬂare kernel and the tempo-
ral variation shows that the temperature suddenly
increased at the beginning of the impulsive phase.

3.3. Summary of results

• The ﬂare kernel is localized during the im-
pulsive phase and the HXR emission, chro-
mospheric intensity, and white light contin-
uum emission in the kernel are spatially and
temporally correlated. The bright kernel
peaks ﬁrst in intensity in the white light con-
tinuum and O I, and then HXR and SXR
emission peaks are observed consecutively.

• The Doppler velocity and line width are en-
hanced during the impulsive phase. The
strongest line width enhancement appears
during the ﬁrst HXR peak, which is just af-

ter the white light ﬂare (within a minute).
This may be a signature of turbulence from
reconnection or heating by non-thermal elec-
trons.

• Chromospheric (O IV) and coronal (Fe XVI)
density diagnostics show a strong enhance-
ment during the impulsive phase.
The
temporal variation indicates that the den-
sity is ﬁrst enhanced in the chromosphere
and later in the corona. This is consistent
with compression of the chromosphere, the
Doppler velocity pattern, and the chromo-
spheric evaporation process.

• The Mg II subordinate line blend is seen in
emission during the pre-ﬂare and impulsive
phase brightenings. The enhancement of the
Mg II core to wing intensity ratio implies the
existence of steep temperature gradients and
heating at the low atmosphere (Pereira et al.
2015). At the time the white light ﬂare oc-
curs, the ratio becomes over 10, suggesting
that strong heating occurs in the lower atmo-
sphere. Moreover, the strong enhancement
of the ratio is correlated to the hard X-ray
peak, which implies that the non-thermally
accelerated electron detected as the HXR
emission might be directly related to the low
atmospheric heating.

4. Discussion

4.1. Spectroscopic results related to the
evaporation ﬂow and white light ﬂare

The ﬂare kernel we discuss in this paper pro-
duced a white light ﬂare when the ﬁrst hard X-ray
peak appeared. The correlation of the HXR peak
and Doppler velocity variation in this ﬂare has al-
ready been reported by Li et al. (2015) using IRIS
observations, and they suggested that this implies
that the ﬂare is electron driven and that energy de-
position from non-thermal electrons produces the
chromospheric evaporation ﬂows and white light
ﬂare.

From electron beam heating simulations (Fisher et al.

1985c,b,a), it is expected that gentle and explosive
evaporation should be observed, depending on the
injected energy ﬂux, and that it can be detected
by examining the velocity variation at diﬀerent
temperatures. When the energy ﬂux injected is

8

high, the simulation shows a blueshift in coronal
evaporation”, and a red-
lines, ”chromospheric
shift in chromospheric lines, ”chromospheric con-
densation”. This is called explosive evaporation.
Conversely, if the injected energy is less than a
critical value, about F20 = 1010 ergs cm−2 s−1,
gentle evaporation is observed, and most spectral
lines are blue shifted.

Figure 11 shows that explosive evaporation oc-
curs at this bright kernel in the impulsive phase.
To conﬁrm the relationship between the deposited
energy from the accelerated electrons and the ob-
served Doppler velocity pattern, we compared the
deposited energy ﬂux measured by RHESSI to the
critical value of the energy ﬂux in the simulations.
Assuming this white light ﬂare is produced by
accelerated non-thermal electrons, we calculated
the total power (P ) in the non-thermal electrons
above a given electron energy (low cut-oﬀ en-
ergy) under the thick target approximation using
the equation (Hudson et al. 1978; Watanabe et al.
2010a),
P (ǫ > ǫc) = 4.3 × 1024 b(γ)
γ − 1

−(γ−1) (erg s

−1).

Aǫc

(1)
For this purpose, we ﬁt the RHESSI hard X-ray
photon spectrum. The right panel of Figure 6
shows the ﬁtted RHESSI spectrum when explosive
evaporation occurs (14:06 UT). ǫc is the low cut-oﬀ
energy, γ is the spectral index, and b(γ) is the aux-
iliary function from Brown (1971) for the relevant
range of γ. To measure the energy ﬂux, we deter-
mined the size of the hard X-ray emitting region
where the HXR (30-100 keV) integrated intensity
is greater than 60 % of the maximum intensity.
The calculated energy ﬂuxes in the non-thermal
electrons at the HXR peaks during the impulsive
phase (∼14:05 and 14:11 UT), assuming a cut-oﬀ
energy of 30 keV, is about 7.7×1010 ergs cm−2 s−1
and 6.1 × 1010 ergs cm−2 s−1, respectively (Fig-
ure 15). The energy of 30 keV is the lowest en-
ergy that contains a negligible amount of ther-
mal emission, and still contains large ﬂuxes of
non-thermal photons. We also estimated the de-
posited energy ﬂuxes by non-thermal HXR elec-
trons above diﬀerent threshold energies because
we don’t know which energy electrons aﬀected
to the WL emission. For example, non-thermal
electrons in low energies cannot penetrate to the
photosphere which produces WL emssion. On

the other hand, the higher energy electrons may
not transport enough energy due to the low pho-
ton ﬂux. Even though we assume the diﬀerent
threshold energies of 40 keV and 50 keV, the en-
ergy ﬂuxes at the impulsive phase are about 3.0 ×
1010 ergs cm−2 s−1 and 1.4 × 1010 ergs cm−2 s−1,
respectively. This shows that the deposited energy
from the hard X-rays is strong enough to produce
explosive evaporation and is consistent with the
observed Doppler velocity pattern.

Furthermore, the ﬂows from explosive evapo-
ration are expected to have a reversal, where the
ﬂows change from downﬂow in the chromosphere
to upﬂow in the corona, and our obsrvations show
such a reversal in the temperature range 0.5-2
MK. The velocities in this range also appear to
be fairly steady. Interestingly, Some downﬂows, of
5 km s−1 in the single gaussian ﬁts and 15 km s−1
when a double gaussian is used, are observed in
the coronal lines (T∼2MK), which is a surpris-
ingly high temperature. A similarly high tem-
perature velocity reversal has previously been re-
ported, however (Li & Ding 2011).

To explain the downﬂows in the coronal lines,
Imada et al. (2015) investigated the dependence of
the ﬂow reversal temperature on diﬀerent thermal

ported quickly by thermal conduction and this sce-
nario shows similar characteristics to the electron

weak, however, the energy is mainly transported
by the entalphy ﬂux and advection. In this case,
the enthalpy ﬂux dominant case, the ﬂow reversal
temperature is much hotter than in the thermal
conduction case. In our observations, a strong red
shift is seen at temperatures around 0.4MK, and
the Doppler velocities in the 0.5-2 MK tempera-
ture range are mostly steady. This implies that
the ﬂow reversal temperature in this ﬂare is not
very high, and is similar to that expected in the
electron beam model. However, the Doppler ve-
locity around 2MK also shows small downﬂows,
suggesting that we cannot neglect the possibility
of energy transport by direct enthalpy ﬂux, in ad-
dition to thermal conduction.

At the same time as the Doppler velocity peaks,
enhanced line widths are observed at ﬂaring tem-
peratures. This may indicate the presence of tur-
bulence from the non-thermal electrons or recon-

9

nection process high in the corona since there
is also a temporal correlation between the HXR
emission and Doppler velocity peak. Most of the
observations show that the electron beam heat-
ing model well explains this ﬂare, and the accel-
erated electrons can produce the white light con-
tinuum emission. However, we cannot rule out
the possibility of Alfv´en waves as a heating mech-
anism (Fletcher & Hudson 2008) given the large
non-thermal width in the lower temperature lines,
Fe XII, He II. Recently, Reep & Russell (2016)
showed that Alfv´en wave dissipation produces sim-
ilar heating signatures to electron beam heating,
for example, explosive evaporation and a signif-
icant temperature enhancement in the chromo-
sphere. If Alfv´en waves transport the energy ﬂux
to the low atmosphere, line widths can also be en-
hanced by the waves.

4.2. RHESSI and IRIS energy ﬂux compar-

ison

One of the important issues for understanding
the white light ﬂare mechanism is how the energy
is transferred to the lower atmosphere to produce
the photospheric emission. Recently, it has been
reported that not only strong ﬂares but also weak
ﬂares (C class ﬂares) can produce white light emis-
sion (Matthews et al. 2003; Hudson et al. 2006).
So it is important to know how much energy is dis-
sipated in the chromosphere and whether the en-
ergy transferred by the electrons is enough to pro-
duce a white light ﬂare. Until recently, it has been
diﬃcult to estimate the energy ﬂux in the chro-
mosphere due to a lack of observations. After the
launch of IRIS, however, high resolution spectro-
scopic observations of the chromosphere have be-
come routine, and Pereira et al. (2015) suggested
that the Mg II triplet could be used as a diagnos-
tic tool for quantitatively measuring temperature
changes in the chromosphere.

We have measured the temperature changes
during the ﬂare using the Mg II triplet intensity
ratio (section 3.1.5), and used the results to es-
timate the energy ﬂux deposited in the chromo-
sphere in response to the ﬂare. The Mg II h & k
components show similar peak intensities during
the ﬂare implying that they might be in emission
even though the plasma is optically thick. Fur-
thermore, the densities measured using the O IV
chromospheric line are strongly enhanced during

the impulsive phase (Figure 12), which suggests
the plasma may be in local thermodynamic equi-
librium (LTE). If we assume the plasma is op-
tically thick and in LTE, the energy ﬂux can
be determined by Stefan-Boltzmann’s law, F =
4. We estimate the temperature enhance-
σTef f
ment during the impulsive phase to be 3 ∼ 3.3 kK
(Figure 14), so the corresponding energy ﬂux is
4.6 − 6.7 × 109 ergs cm−2 s−1. Taking this energy
ﬂux as an estimate of the amount of energy dissi-
pated in the chromosphere, it is about 6 ∼ 22 %
of the deposited energy from the accelerated non-
thermal electrons measured by RHESSI assuming
the cut-oﬀ energy of 30 ∼ 40 keV. This result
implies that the majority of the energy from the
non-thermal electrons accelerated in the corona is
still available to directly produce a white light ﬂare
in this event.

Recently, Milligan et al. (2014) and Kleint et al.
(2016) investigated the continuum enhancement
across the EUV, UV, visible, and infra-red during
a ﬂare, and compared it to the energy deposited
by non-thermal electrons observed by RHESSI. In
their investigation, Milligan et al. (2014) showed
that 15 % of the deposited energy is radiated by
line and continuum emission in the lower atmo-
sphere and Kleint et al. (2016) found that 23%
of the deposited energy is radiated by continuum
emission. From their investigations, more than
60 % of the energy is unaccounted for, and they
suggested that it is dissipated by heating, plasma
motions, or radiated away in other spectral re-
gions or lines. Using IRIS and HMI continuum
observations, we also measured the energy ﬂux
from the UV and WL continuum. We converted
the observed Mg II DN to intensity using the
iris get response.pro routine in SolarSoft and we
calibrated the HMI intensity by comparison with
the disk intensity reported in the atlas of Brault
& Neckel. We then estimated the radiated power,
Pλ = π Iλ A ∆λ, using the intensities (Iλ) and
band widths (∆λ) of the IRIS and HMI continua.
The energy ﬂuxes from the RHESSI HXR, IRIS
Mg II triplet, and HMI continuum are shown in
Figure 15 and the energy ﬂuxes in the UV and
HMI continuum are only very small fractions of
the power in the HXR emission. The estimated
energy ﬂux from dissipation by heating in the
chromosphere may amount to ∼ 10% of the de-
posited energy.

In this study, even though we have not per-
formed any numerical modeling, we have been able
to measure the temperature changes in the chro-
mosphere quantitatively using the Mg II triplet
observed by IRIS, as suggested by Pereira et al.
(2015).
It is the ﬁrst attempt to apply this di-
agnostic technique to ﬂare observations, and the
results show that the temperature changes in the
chromosphere are about 3000 K, which is consis-
tent with the results from the numerical modeling
of the UV to IR spectra of Kleint et al. (2016).
The results support their suggestion from numer-
ical modeling that quite a strong temperature en-
hancement is needed in the chromosphere to pro-
duce noticeable continuum enhancement in the
ﬂare.

5. Summary

A bright kernel in an X1.6 ﬂare on 2014 Octo-
ber 22 was observed by Hinode, IRIS, SDO, and
RHESSI. The simultaneous observations covered
the whole duration of the ﬂare and the bright
kernel produces a multi-wavelength intensity en-
hancement from continuum to hard X-rays. We
investigated the temporal variation of the spectral
properties of this kernel and estimated the energy
ﬂux at diﬀerent wavelengths.

The multi-wavelength spectroscopic observa-
tions show that the ﬂare kernel is localized during
the impulsive phase and the HXR emission, chro-
mospheric intensity, and white light continuum
emission in the kernel are spatially and tempo-
rally correlated. We found that explosive evap-
oration occurs and there are strong line width
enhancements during the ﬁrst peak of the hard
X-ray emission, which is also coincident with the
timing of the white light ﬂare. This may indi-
cate that electron beam heating produces strong
evaporation ﬂows and there is turbulence from
the reconnection or non-thermal electron heating.
Furthermore, the Mg II subordinate line blend
is in emission during the impulsive phase. The
strong enhancement of the Mg II core to wing in-
tensity ratio line is correlated with the hard X-ray
peak, imply the existence of a steep temperature
gradient and heating. The correlated temporal
variation of the hard X-ray, white light, explosive
evaporation ﬂows, the Mg II line response and the
comparison of the energy ﬂux through the corona

10

to the chromosphere implies that the ﬂare heat-
ing and evaporation ﬂow is driven by non-thermal
electrons, though we cannot rule out a possible
contribution from Alf´en wave heating.

We have also estimated the energy ﬂux in the
bright kernel using the intensities and tempera-
ture changes in the chromosphere. Comparison of
the deposited energy in the corona and the dissi-
pated energy in the chromosphere shows that ac-
celerated electrons dissipate only ∼20 % of their
energy in the chromosphere and the remaining en-
ergy is enough to directly produce white light ﬂare
emission in the photosphere. The ﬂare we investi-
gated is quite strong: X 1.6, so while the acceler-
ated non-thermal electrons from this strong ﬂare
could produce a white light ﬂare directly in this
event, we still do not know whether most white
light ﬂares can be produced by the energy from
the accelerated electrons, or whether this process
works even in small ﬂares. Therefore, further stud-
ies applying similar techniques to other ﬂares that
produce white light emission are needed to con-
ﬁrm whether they can also be produced directly
or not.

Fig. 1.— GOES x-ray light curve (top) of the X1.6 ﬂare on 2014 October 22 14:06 UT and its time
derivative (middle). The RHESSI count rates for the diﬀerent energy bands are plotted in the bottom panel.
The vertical dashed lines (a-c) mark the times of the three peaks in the time derivative of the GOES X-ray
light curve.

Fig. 2.— Context SDO and IRIS/SJI C II 1330 ˚A images for the X1.6 class ﬂare on 2014 October 22. (a-c):
AIA 211 ˚A, (e-g): AIA 1700 ˚A channel images, (i-k): IRIS C II 1330 ˚A slit jaw images overlaid with EIS
195 ˚A intensity contours (gray line) taken before the ﬂare (∼13:37 UT), at the time of the ﬁrst HXR peak
(∼14:06 UT), and at the ﬂare peak (∼14:24 UT). The white dashed box in the IRIS SJI corresponds to the
location of the IRIS raster. Panels (d) and (h) display the SDO/HMI continuum and a running diﬀerence
image at 14:05:45 UT, respectively. Panel (l) depicts the polarity inversion line from the HMI magnetogram
on the IRIS SJI around timing (a) in Figure 1. The bright kernel we analyzed is marked with an arrow.

Fig. 3.— EIS spectral line proﬁles of each emission line for the bright kernel observed at 14:06:13 (impulsive
phase). The green solid lines and red dashed lines represent the total line proﬁles from single or multiple
Gaussian ﬁts and each Gaussian component, respectively. The black vertical dashed lines represent the rest
wavelengths obtained from averaging the line center before the ﬂare from 13:01 to 13:51 UT. The red green
vertical dotted lines correspond to the line centers of the ﬁtted line proﬁle for the single gaussian and the
shifted component from the multiple gaussian ﬁt.

17

Fig. 4.— IRIS spectral line proﬁles of Fe XXI (top) and Si IV (bottom) for the bright kernel observed
during the impulsive phase. The green solid lines and black dotted lines represent the total line proﬁles from
multiple Gaussian ﬁts and each Gaussian component, respectively. In the upper panels, the black vertical
dashed and dot-dashed lines represent the rest wavelengths relative to O I and the reference wavelengths
from the Chianti atomic database, respectively. In the lower panels, the dot-dashed and dashed lines show
the rest wavelength and the ﬁrst gaussian ﬁt component of Si IV, respectively. The red vertical dashed line
corresponds to the line center of the ﬁtted line proﬁle for the shifted component of Fe XXI and Si IV. The
Fe XXI emission and the second Gaussian ﬁt for Si IV are marked with a red dotted Gaussian line proﬁle.

Fig. 5.— SDO/AIA light curves for the bright kernel. Intensities are normalized by the maximum intensity
during the ﬂare observation. The dashed vertical lines correspond to the same times marked in Figure 1.

Fig. 6.— Left: HMI continuum diﬀerence image with HXR (30-100 keV) and SXR (12-25 keV) contours
overlaid from the RHESSI cleaned image covering 14:05:32-14:06:32 UT. Red and green contours correspond
to 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90% of the HXR and SXR intensity, respectively. Right: Fitted RHESSI spectrum
with energy for a ﬂux in the energy range of 20-100 keV during 14:05:32-14:06:32 UT. Black and red lines
indicate the observed and ﬁtted spectrum, respectively.

IRIS Fe XXI, (d) Si IV, (e) O I, and (f) SDO/HMI continuum. The intensities from the IRIS spectra are
normalized by the maximum intensity during the ﬂare. The HMI continuum intensity peak is enhanced by
around 3.8 × 104 erg cm−2 s−1 sr−1.

Fig. 8.— Temporal variation of the EIS spectral line intensities for the bright kernel. Intensities are nor-
malized by the maximum intensity during the ﬂare observation. The vertical dashed lines correspond to the
times marked in Figure 1.

Fig. 9.— Temporal variation of the Doppler velocity (top) and line width (bottom) for the bright kernel
from the EIS spectral lines, He II, Fe XII, Fe XV, and Fe XXIII. The vertical dashed lines correspond to the
same times as shown in Figure 1.

Fig. 10.— Temporal variation of the intensity (top), Doppler velocity (middle), and line width (bottom) for
the bright kernel from the IRIS spectral lines, O I (black), Si IV (red), and Fe XXI (blue). Intensities are
normalized by the maximum intensity during the ﬂare observation. The vertical dashed lines correspond to
the same times as shown in Figure 1.

Fig. 11.— Doppler velocities from EIS and IRIS as a function of the peak formation temperature for
the bright kernel at diﬀerent times, (a) before the ﬂare, (b) the impulsive phase, and (c) the gradual phase.
Diamonds indicate the Doppler velocities from the IRIS spectra while crosses represent the Doppler velocities
from the EIS spectra. Black and red indicate the velocities calculated from the single and multiple Gaussian
components relative to the rest wavelengths. The element and ionization information of the spectral lines
are noted at the bottom of the panel (a).

25

Fig. 12.— Top: temporal variation of the IRIS O IV 1399.8 ˚A / 1401.2 ˚A intensity ratio for the bright
kernel. The horizontal solid and dashed lines indicate the high density limit ratio of 0.43 (log Ne=13) and
the averaged intensity ratio before and after the impulsive phase, respectively. Bottom: temporal variation
of the density measured from the EIS Fe XIV 264.79 ˚A / 274.20 ˚A intensity ratio for the bright kernel. The
vertical dashed lines indicate the times marked in Figure 1.

26

Fig. 13.— IRIS detector images of the Mg II h & k spectral windows overlaid with the averaged spectral
line proﬁles at the location marked by the two horizontal green lines. The solid and dotted lines represent
the line proﬁles during the impulsive phase and before the ﬂare (around 12:00 UT), respectively. The arrows
indicate the red shifts in the Mg II spectral lines.
