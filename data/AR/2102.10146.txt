ABSTRACT

A recent study demonstrated that freedom of convection and strength of magnetic ﬁeld in the photospheric
feet of active-region (AR) coronal loops, together, can engender or quench heating in them. Other studies stress
that magnetic ﬂux cancellation at the loop-feet potentially drives heating in loops. We follow 24-hour movies
of a bipolar AR, using EUV images from SDO/AIA and line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from SDO/HMI,
to examine magnetic polarities at the feet of 23 of the brightest coronal loops. We derived FeXVIII emission
(hot-94) images (using the Warren et al. method) to select the hottest/brightest loops, and conﬁrm their foot-
point locations via non-force-free ﬁeld extrapolations. From 6”×6” boxes centered at each loop foot in LOS
magnetograms we ﬁnd that ∼40% of the loops have both feet in unipolar ﬂux, and ∼60% of the loops have at
least one foot in mixed-polarity ﬂux. The loops with both feet unipolar are ∼15% shorter lived on average than
the loops having mixed-polarity foot-point ﬂux, but their peak-intensity averages are equal. The presence of
mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux in at least one foot of majority of the loops suggests that ﬂux cancellation at the
footpoints may drive most of the heating. But, the absence of mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux (to the detection
limit of HMI) in ∼40% of the loops suggests that ﬂux cancellation may not be necessary to drive heating in
coronal loops – magnetoconvection and ﬁeld strength at both loop feet possibly drive much of the heating, even
in the cases where a loop foot presents mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux.

1. INTRODUCTION

Magnetic energy dissipated in coronal loops by unknown
processes heats the Sun’s corona to millions of Kelvin. The
brightest and hottest extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray so-
lar coronal loops are rooted in strong magnetic ﬂux in ac-
tive regions (ARs) (Golub et al. 1980; Fisher et al. 1998;
Dahlburg et al. 2018; Ugarte-Urra et al. 2019; Asgari-Targhi
et al. 2019). These loops have temperatures of 2-6 MK,
or more. The processes for heating them to these temper-
atures remain ill-determined (Zirker 1993; Schrijver et al.
1998; Moore et al. 1999; Aschwanden 2005; Katsukawa &
Tsuneta 2005; Klimchuk 2006; Reale 2014; Hinode Review
Team et al. 2019). The two most well-known mechanisms
that could explain these temperatures are magentohydrody-
namic (MHD) waves (e.g., van Ballegooijen et al. 2011, and
references therein) and nanoﬂare heating (Parker 1972, 1983,
1988).

In both cases, magnetoconvection most probably drives the
magnetic energy input (e.g., Tiwari et al. 2017). Photospheric
convection can produce MHD waves that transport energy

to higher parts of the Sun’s atmosphere (Priest et al. 1994,
2002). Photospheric convective motion can also randomly
shuﬄe the feet of the coronal loops so that they become en-
tangled and braided, dissipating the magnetic energy by cur-
rent sheet dissipation in the higher solar atmosphere (Parker
1983, 1988). Recent observations of an AR and modelling
show evidence of braided magnetic structures in the corona
(Cirtain et al. 2013; Thalmann et al. 2014; Tiwari et al. 2014;
Pontin et al. 2017).

Some studies (Falconer et al. 1997; Tiwari et al. 2014,
2017, 2019; Chitta et al. 2017, 2018; Priest et al. 2018) ﬁnd
the presence of mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux at the feet of the
brightest coronal loops and suggest a third manner of driving
heating – by ﬂux cancellation at the loop feet. According to
these studies, the brightest AR coronal loops most frequently
have at least one footpoint in a region of mixed-polarity mag-
netic ﬂux. This implies that over time, magnetoconvection
causes an increase in the injection of free magnetic energy
into the brightest coronal loops via some consequence of
the opposite-polarity ﬂux, which is most probably magnetic

ﬂux cancellation, often accompanied by small-scale mag-
netic ﬂux emergence (Tiwari et al. 2019; S¸ ahin et al. 2019).
Magnetic reconnection events taking place very low in the
chromosphere, accompanied by magnetic ﬂux cancellation,
evidenced by ﬁne-scale explosive events and chromospheric
inverted-Y-shaped jets in the lower solar atmosphere at these
sites, can feed energy and hot plasma into the corona (Chitta
et al. 2017; Tiwari et al. 2019; Panesar et al. 2019, 2020).
Magnetic ﬂux cancellation is most probably the result of
submergence of lower reconnected loops (e.g., Tiwari et al.
2019, and references therein). Priest et al. (2018) have de-
scribed a theoretical model of how chromospheric and coro-
nal heating of loops might depend on ﬂux cancellation speed,
ﬂux size, and ﬁeld strength in the loop (see also Syntelis &
Priest 2020). An observational test supporting this model was
recently performed by Park (2020).

Tiwari et al. (2017) demonstrated that photospheric mag-
netic rooting plays an important role in determining the
amount of heating in AR coronal loops – freedom of con-
vection and strength of magnetic ﬁeld in the loop-feet, to-
gether, can enhance or suppress heating in coronal loops. Us-
ing EUV observations and non-linear force-free modelling of
two ARs they found that the hottest loops of an AR are the
ones connecting sunspot umbra/penumbra at one end to (a)
penumbra, (b) unipolar plage, or (c) mixed-polarity plage on
the other end. The loops connecting dark sunspot umbra at
both ends were not visible in EUV images. Thus, these loops
are the coolest loops, despite being rooted in the strongest
magnetic ﬁeld regions. They concluded that both the ﬁeld
strength and freedom of convection at the loop feet play cru-
cial role in determining the heating magnitude of the loop. As
mentioned earlier, some recent investigations stress more on
the loop-foot mixed-polarity (above-mentioned connectivity
‘c’), suggesting that ﬂux cancellation is involved in heating
chromospheric and coronal loops. In the present work we in-
vestigate whether all or most of the hottest loops of an AR
have mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux at their feet. If not, what
percentage of them are rooted in unipolar magnetic ﬂux at
each end of the loop?

If it turns out that at least one foot of each hot loop has
mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux, then it would provide strong
evidence to the idea of ﬂux cancellation being involved in
driving heating of coronal loops. The presence of unipolar
ﬁeld at both feet of hot loops will support the idea that (ir-
respective of polarity mixture at the loop feet) heating of the
hottest coronal loops depends primarily on the freedom of
convection at the loop feet, together with the strength of the
magnetic ﬁeld there (Tiwari et al. 2017), not primarily on ﬂux
cancellation.

2. DATA AND MODELLING

We examine EUV/UV images of NOAA AR 12712 ob-
tained with Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen
et al. 2012) on-board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO
Pesnell et al. 2012) to investigate the hot emissions cen-
tered on the Fe XVIII line (6-8 MK), by treating the data
to omit the 1 MK plasma detection. To isolate the brightest
and hottest coronal loops of the AR in question, we use the
method laid out in Warren et al. (2012) to subtract out the
warm component of the 94 Å intensity:

I94warm = 0.39

where I171 and I193 are the respective intensities of AIA 171
Å and AIA 193 Å; f is determined to be 0.31; ai are, in order,
−7.31 × 10−2, 9.75 × 10−1, 9.90 × 10−2, and 2.84 × 10−3.

We refer to Fe XVIII emission images calculated by the
above method as hot 94 images. To create the hot 94 im-
ages, we downloaded 94 Å, 171 Å, and 193 Å AIA data at a
three-minute cadence for the 24 hours of May 29, 2018 from
Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) with two im patch
parameters: (1) a center at -230”, 270” and (2) a box height
and width of 600” (Figure 1). The EUV channels have a 12-
second temporal cadence and a 1.2” resolution (0.6” pixel
size) (Lemen et al. 2012). However a 3-minute cadence
worked well for our purpose because most of the hottest
loops lived well beyond 3-minutes, the shortest one living
for about 12 minutes (see Table 1).

The 94 Å channel captures the characteristic emission of
Fe XVIII from plasma at 6-8 MK, but also captures emis-
sion of plasma around 1 MK (Warren et al. 2012). The 171
Å channel detects the characteristic emission of the Fe IX
line from plasma at about 0.8 MK and the 193 Å channel
shows the characteristic emission of Fe XII from plasma at
around 1.5 MK (Reale et al. 2011; Lemen et al. 2012). All
images were normalized by dividing each image by its expo-
sure time.

For investigating photospheric magnetic ﬂux polarity at the
loop feet, we downloaded line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms
from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Schou
et al. 2012; Scherrer et al. 2012), also onboard SDO, of the
same ﬁeld of view (FOV) as AIA EUV images at a 3-minute
cadence, the same cadence as used for AIA images. In Fig-
ure 1, we show our active region NOAA 12712 in UV, EUV,
processed AIA images and a processed HMI magnetogram.
This AR is of interest because it is a bipolar region observed
close to the solar disk center during an otherwise quiet Sun.
This AR was also observed on this day (May 29, 2018) by
Hi-C 2.1 (Rachmeler et al. 2019).

All our generated maps (AIA and HMI) were processed
and de-rotated using SolarSoft routines (Freeland & Handy
1998). We discarded the one time frame in this set that shows
very large noise. We examined the UV AIA data at 1600 Å

to conﬁrm alignment between each of the EUV wavelengths
and LOS magnetograms. After these data treatments we fol-
lowed each hot loop in our 24-hour span of observations
to select the most clearly visible hot loops, which are suf-
ﬁciently isolated from other hot loops in the surroundings.
This led to selection of 23 hot loops in the 24 hours of data.
For each loop, we made a light curve of the emission in a 2”
x 2” box placed on the brightest segment of the loop top to
obtain the loop’s start, peak-brightness, and end times.

Note that in a few cases there are two loops tangled in the
way that they have a single foot on one end. Because these
loops are spatially isolated from other bright loops, we in-
cluded them in our study and counted these as two separate
loops.

After visual identiﬁcation of the footpoints of the hottest
coronal loops using a zoomed-in FOV, we chose the loca-
tions and placed boxes (of size 6”×6”) centered at the loop
feet (see pink boxes in Figure 2). To conﬁrm the place-
ment of these boxes we performed coronal magnetic ﬁeld

extrapolations from photospheric vector magnetograms. The
coronal magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations were from HMI vector
magnetograms (Space weather HMI Active Region Patches
– HMI SHARPs: Bobra et al. 2014) using the non-force-free
extrapolation technique described in Hu et al. (2010). The
visualizations were carried out in VAPOR software (Li et al.
2019). The extrapolation technique works best when the bot-
tom boundary is ﬂux-balanced and the ﬁeld strength is sig-
niﬁcantly higher than the magnetogram noise level.

Because the AR remained close to disk center (within 30
degrees from the disk center) during our observation period,
we did not deproject the magnetograms for our loop extrap-
olations. Deprojection is usually not required if the AR is
within 30 degrees from the solar disk center (e.g., Falconer
et al. 2016).

Coordinates and times had to be approximated between the
HMI SHARPs and HMI LOS Magnetograms due to their dif-
ferent temporal cadences of 12 and 3 minutes (used here),
respectively. To accommodate this approximation, we exam-

4

ined the three LOS magnetograms before and after the iden-
tiﬁed peak time of each loop to ensure no signiﬁcant ﬂux
changes occur. To ﬁnd the coordinates of each of the two
feet of each loop, we ﬁrst made sure that the observed loop
closely traced its model ﬁeld lines and then selected the co-
ordinates of each foot to be those of that foot of the model
ﬁeld lines.

For each of the footpoints of the 23 loops, we made a his-
togram of the LOS magnetic ﬁeld strength and polarity from
the 144 pixels inside the 6” x 6” box centered on the footpoint
to determine which loops had two unipolar footpoint boxes,
which had one unipolar box and one mixed-polarity box, and
which had mixed-polarity ﬂux in both footpoint boxes.

We also measured peak intensities of all loops. Based on
the size of the thinnest loops in our sample, we selected a box
size of 2” by 2” to measure the peak intensity of the loop,
see the yellow boxes in Figure 2. For this, we integrated
intensity of the hot 94 image inside the 2”×2” box during
the peak time of each loop. The box was placed at several
places along the loop to ﬁnd out the maximum value of the
integrated intensity. For each loop, we used the light curve
of the 2” x 2” box to ﬁnd the start time, the peak-brightness
time, and the end time of the loop, and to obtain the intensity
of the emission in the box at the peak-brightness time (the
loop’s peak intensity given in Table 1). The light curves for
three loops are shown in Figure 3.

3. RESULTS

We found 23 of the brightest coronal loops that qualify un-
der our selection criterion for loops described in Section 2
(e.g., loops should be bright and hot enough to be clearly
visible in hot 94, they should be fairly isolated from other
loops in the surroundings, and peak well in light curves). In
Table 1, we list the 23 selected hot coronal loops, three of
which are presented in detail in Figures 2, and 4. Each of the
23 loops is marked by pink arrows in Movie1.mp4, in three
frames (during the peak intensity time, on a frame just before
the peak intensity time, and on a frame just after the peak in-
tensity time). Our use of the hot 94 technique ensures that
the selected loops are over 1 MK (Warren et al. 2012).

In Table 1, we give the start, peak, and end times of each
loop found via visual tracking of the loops as well as from
light curves, and also give the overall lifetime of each loop.
We followed each loop from their peak time in forward and
backward directions in time, visually and in light curves, to
deﬁne the loop start/end time, which is when the loop gets al-
most invisible (or shows the lowest intensity in light curves)
in hot 94 images in backward/forward time from their peak
time. The lifetimes of diﬀerent hot loops vary from 12 min-
utes to two hours, with an average lifetime of 46±6 minutes.
Typical coronal loops have a lifetime of 20–30 minutes
(Mulu-Moore et al. 2011; Peter & Bingert 2012; Reale 2014),

but the lifetime of the smallest loops can be less than a minute
to a few minutes (Winebarger et al. 2013; Tiwari et al. 2019),
and the hottest loops can live upto multiple hours (L´opez
Fuentes et al. 2007; Klimchuk et al. 2010). Most of the
longest lived loops are probably a result of interaction of mul-
tiple loop strands, which sequentially heat making the loop
bundle live much longer than a loop strand (e.g., Warren et al.
2002). Loop 23 in Table 1 shows this behavior of sequential
heating (see Movie1.mp4).

The coordinates of the center of the box outlining the two
footpoints for each loop are also given in Table 1. For easy
identiﬁcation, the coordinates in bold font indicate that the
surrounding box has unipolar magnetic ﬂux; all others have
mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux. We quantiﬁed the distribution
of magnetic ﬁeld strength and polarity at each foot of each
loop via histograms of LOS magnetograms within the se-
lected footpoint region, in the way presented in Figure 5 for
three examples. We use a 6”×6” boxed area centered at each
foot to obtain LOS magnetogram histograms at each foot.
The 6”×6” size of the box ensures that the loop foot is com-
pletely covered within the box.

We have three categories of loops: 1. loops having unipo-
lar magnetic ﬂux in both feet, 2. loops having mixed-polarity
magnetic ﬂux in both feet, and 3. loops having one foot in
mixed-polarity ﬂux and the other foot in unipolar magnetic
ﬂux. Of the 23 loops that we examined, ∼40% (9/23) have
both feet in unipolar magnetic ﬂux, ∼4% of loops (1/23) have
both feet in mixed-polarity ﬂux, and ∼56% (13/23) have one
foot in unipolar and one in mixed-polarity ﬂux.

We have considered the presence of mixed-polarity only
when the LOS magnetogram at the loop foot contains values
≥ 20 G of positive or negative minority polarity ﬂux. The
random noise level in the LOS magnetograms is about 7 G
(Couvidat et al. 2016), fairly well below our selected lower
limit. We would have counted footpoint 2 of our only cat-
egory 2 loop as unipolar if there was no minority-polarity
pixel with a negative Bz value larger than 20 G, i.e., if there
were no pixel in the second bin (in 20–40 G range, bin size is
20 G) on the negative/minority polarity side of the zero line
in this footpoint box’s histogram in Figure 5. This case is the
most marginal one in our sample – in all other mix-polarity
cases there are several to many minority-polarity pixels with
the magnitude of Bz larger than 20 G.

Because there is only one loop in the category of both loop-
feet having mixed-polarity ﬂux, in our discussions we often
count that in the category of loops having at least one foot in
mixed-polarity ﬂux region.

In Figure 2 we show three example loops, one from each
of the three categories. In the top row of Figure 2, we show
an example loop that has both feet in unipolar magnetic ﬂux
(category 1); the peak time in the hot 94 image comes at
05:02:59 and the associated LOS HMI magnetogram is ob-

that for the loops having unipolar ﬂux at both feet comes out to be 1220±120 DN s−1. This shows that there is insigniﬁcant
diﬀerence in the peak intensities of the loops having mixed-polarity ﬂux or unipolar ﬂux at their feet.

(from Movie1.mp4) in hot 94 and the right column (panels b, d, f) presents the same FOV of LOS magnetograms. Insets b1, b2, d1, d2 and f1,
f2 are each a further zoomed-in view of the LOS magnetogram of each loop foot. White/black/grey colours in the LOS magnetograms are for
positive/negative/zero ﬁeld. Category 1 (uppermost row) has two unipolar feet – shown example is Loop 6 in Table 1; Category 2 (middle row)
has two mixed-polarity feet – shown example is Loop 8 in Table 1; Category 3 (bottom row) has one unipolar and one mixed-polarity foot –
shown example is Loop 4 in Table 1. Pink boxes on the hot 94 images and on the LOS magnetograms outline the 6” x 6” area examined in the
LOS magnetograms and give the corresponding ﬁeld-strength and polarity histograms (see Fig. 5). Yellow boxes on the loop outline the 2” x

loop for each of the three alternative categories. From Table 1, the example loop for category 1 is Loop 6, the example loop for category 2 is
Loop 8, and the example loop for category 3 is Loop 4. The left panels present histograms of footpoints 1 of the three loops (the foot located in
the negative majority polarity region) and the right panels present histograms of footpoints 2 of the three loops (the foot located in the positive
majority polarity region). The vertical pink line in each panel marks Bz = 0.

The last set of images in Figure 2 show an example loop
having one footpoint in unipolar magnetic ﬂux and the other
footpoint in mixed-polarity ﬂux (category 3). The peak time
in the hot 94 image is 04:44:59 and the closest LOS HMI
magnetogram is at 04:44:52. The bottom panel in Figure 4
contains the extrapolated ﬁeld lines. The bottom row of Fig-
ure 5 shows the histograms of the two feet of this loop.

Our non-force-free ﬁeld extrapolations match well with the
observed loops, conﬁrming the selection of footpoint loca-

tions (e.g., in Figure 4). Histograms of LOS magnetograms
clearly show whether a loop foot has a unipolar, or mixed-
polarity magnetic ﬁeld (e.g., in Figure 5). All of our results
are listed in Table 1.

We also measured the peak intensity of each loop inside a
2”×2” box during its peak intensity time (see yellow boxes
in Figure 2) and list the values in Table 1. The peak intensity
time for each loop was selected based on visual inspection of
loops in the hot 94 movie. The location of the area for calcu-

the loops. To make sure the selected area was on the bright-
est location of the loop, we placed our 2”×2” box at several
places, as needed, along each loop. There is no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in the peak intensities of two major categories of
loops (i) having unipolar ﬂux at both of their feet or (ii) hav-
ing at least one foot in mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux (see Ta-
ble 1, comment ‘e’).

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We performed our observational analysis and modelling
eﬀorts to investigate if magnetic ﬂux cancellation (inferred
from the presence of mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux) at the
loop feet could be a signiﬁcant heating mechanism for the
hottest and brightest loops in the solar corona of the NOAA
AR 12712.

Our ﬁnding that 60% of the loops (14 out of 23 loops un-
der investigation) contain HMI-detected mixed-polarity mag-
netic ﬂux at least at one of their feet is consistent with the
idea of magnetic ﬂux cancellation being involved in heating
these loops. The magnetic ﬂux cancellation at a footpoint
plausibly resulted from magnetic reconnection in the lower
solar atmosphere of coronal loops releasing stored magnetic
energy (Tiwari et al. 2014; Chitta et al. 2018; Tiwari et al.
2019). Recent examinations of magnetic ﬂux cancellation,
such as that of Chitta et al. (2018), note that only part of the
dissipating magnetic energy reaches into the corona – some
reaches only into the chromosphere.

However,

the absence of HMI-detected mixed-polarity
magnetic ﬂux from the feet of about 40% of the loops inves-
tigated here challenges this idea and allows the possibility
that magnetoconvection, in tandem with the magnetic ﬁeld
strength at the loop footpoints, could alone be responsible
for loop heating (Tiwari et al. 2017). The same mechanism
might dominate in heating the loops having mixed-polarity
magnetic ﬂux at one or both of their feet.

We did not visually notice any signiﬁcant magnetic ﬂux
emergence and/or cancellation near the loop-feet during life-
times of any loop. Furthermore, we could not establish mag-
netic ﬂux emergence and/or cancellation at the feet of the
loops over time because of not being able to track the adja-
cent opposite-polarity ﬂux adequately for this purpose. This
reason is also described in Tiwari et al. (2019) for several of
the loops found in the core of the same AR.

The process of loop selection beneﬁted signiﬁcantly by the
use of hot 94 emission. Most of the times hotter loops were
very cleanly isolated in hot 94 images and were not so clearly
isolated in AIA 94, 193 or 171 Å images. Many loops were
clearly identiﬁable in the hot 94 images, but not in 94 Å, 193
Å, or in 171 Å images. We selected the loops partially also
by our ability to perform non-force-free loop extrapolations
– we were forced to throw out the cases in which the VAPOR

9

software presented too many small loops making it diﬃcult
to isolate the loop of interest.

The AR investigated is at the peak of its lifetime during the
24-hour movie, and starts decaying during or immediately af-
ter the observations we use in our study. Thus, it is suitable
for investigations such as those presented here, avoiding ef-
fects of pervasive ﬂux emergence (found in the early phase of
ARs) or obvious cancellation (found in the decaying phase of
ARs).

The peak intensities of the loops with unipolar ﬂux at
both feet versus the loops with mixed-polarity ﬂux at least
at one foot do not show a signiﬁcant diﬀerence, thus sug-
gesting that polarity mixture at a loop-foot (or at both
feet) probably does not provide additional heating to the
loops. On the other hand, the loops having no HMI-detected
mixed-polarity ﬂux at either foot had marginally signiﬁ-
cantly shorter lifetime than the loops having some HMI-
detected mixed-polarity ﬂux at one foot or both feet. This
suggests that shorter-lived below-HMI-detectability mixed-
polarity ﬂux might have been present at the apparently unipo-
lar feet of these loops and might have been the main driver
of the shorter-lived coronal heating in these loops. We note
however that the brightness of the loops depends on other
factors such as loop length, and area expansion with height
(e.g., Klimchuk 2006; Winebarger et al. 2008; Reale 2014;
Dahlburg et al. 2018; Hinode Review Team et al. 2019),
which have not been taken into account. Thus, the loop-
heating problem requires extensive further investigation.

In the AR investigated here, there are no fully developed
sunspots, as compared to the ARs studied in Tiwari et al.
(2017). Therefore the loops selected here have mostly plage-
to-plage connections, and no sunspot connections as were de-
scribed in Tiwari et al. (2017). We have therefore studied
here coronal loops having plage-to-plage connections (only
one class of those described in the above-mentioned study),
and explored what percentage of such loops have mixed-
polarity ﬂux at their base and what percentage are unipolar
at both feet. We note that this percentage depends heavily on
the selection criterion of loops. Thus, our results have limited
absolute signiﬁcance and cannot be extended to all loops, not
even to hot ones only.

There are two possibilities from the present study: ei-
ther (i) future studies using new generation telescopes giv-
ing higher spatial resolution and higher sensitivity magne-
tograms will conﬁrm that the presence of mixed-polarity
magnetic ﬂux, thus ﬂux cancellation, is universal for coro-
nal loop heating, or (ii) the heating is mainly from unipolar
ﬂux and it does not matter much whether the loop feet con-
tains a mixed-polarity ﬂux or not —mainly ﬁeld strength and
convective freedom at the loop feet determine how much the
loop is heated.

10

Our loop extrapolations serve to conﬁrm where the foot-
points are for each of the loops investigated. Given the ca-
dence diﬀerence between the HMI LOS and HMI SHARP
magnetograms, some error might result. However, given that
the loop lifetimes are usually ≥ 24 minutes, the small dif-
ference in time between the HMI LOS and vector magne-
tograms is probably negligible. The excellent visual agree-
ment between the loops of interest as seen on the hot 94 im-
ages and the extrapolated loops viewed with VAPOR from
the correct orientation calculated from the outward normal at
the patch center gives us a high degree of conﬁdence in our
selection of the boxes surrounding the footpoints.

Further, the size of the box of 6” by 6” probably includes
the footpoint and little more. The selected foot area is slightly
larger to make sure any part of the loop foot is not missed for
the histograms. Thus, it is possible that we counted a few
pixels of surrounding area not in the foot of a loop. As a re-
sult we might have over-estimated the number of loops with
a foot (or both feet) in mixed-polarity. Thus, the number of
loops with a mixed-polarity foot in our study can be consid-
ered to be at the upper limit, while the ones with both feet
unipolar can be considered to be at their lower limit. This
would then result into a larger number of loops with unipo-
lar ﬂux at both of their feet, thus providing further strength
to the idea that only magnetoconvection, together with the
strength of magnetic ﬁeld at the loop feet (irrespective of the
presence/absence of mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux), drives
most of the loop heating.
In this scenario both pictures –
MHD waves and nanoﬂares, can contribute signiﬁcantly to
the bright-loop heating in AR 12712.

Further, Reale et al. (2019) found that hot spots in the tran-
sition region are the footpoints of very hot and transient coro-
nal loops, which often show strong magnetic interactions and
rearrangements. Thus, they concluded that hot bright loops

often result from magnetic tangling and presumably by large
angle reconnection, see also Testa et al. (2014, 2020) and
Testa & Reale (2020). A similar scenario is possible at least
in a few of our loops that are entangled (see, e.g., loops peak-
ing at 05:41:59, 06:47:59, and 12:53:59 UT).

Two main limitations of the present study are 1.

limited
sample of loops, and 2. limited spatial resolution of the HMI
LOS magnetograms. We also do not know if these results
based on one AR’s loops are valid for other larger and more
complicated ARs. Similar isolated ARs with proximity to
disk center would be suitable candidates for further investi-
gation. Future research using bigger samples of loops from
diﬀerent ARs and better magnetogram data, e.g., from the
Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (Tritschler et al. 2016),
should validate or challenge the present results.
