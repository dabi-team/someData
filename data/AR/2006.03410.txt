We report on an experimental and theoretical study of the ionization-fragmentation dynamics of
argon dimers in intense few-cycle laser pulses with a tagged carrier-envelope phase. We ﬁnd that
a ﬁeld-driven electron transfer process from one argon atom across the system boundary to the
other argon atom triggers sub-cycle electron-electron interaction dynamics in the neighboring atom.
This attosecond electron-transfer process between distant entities and its implications manifest
themselves as a distinct phase-shift between the measured asymmetry of electron emission curves of
the Ar+ + Ar2+ and Ar2+ + Ar2+ fragmentation channels. Our work discloses a strong-ﬁeld route
to controlling the dynamics in molecular compounds through the excitation of electronic dynamics
on a distant molecule by driving inter-molecular electron-transfer processes.

Photoinduced molecular charge-transfer (CT) across
system boundaries is a key step in many important nat-
ural or technical processes such as solar-driven energy
production [1, 2], photocatalysis [3, 4], or photosyn-
thetic activity [5, 6].
In these processes the relocation
of charge, initiated by the absorption of a single pho-
ton by a molecule, is determined by the energetic and
spatial structure of the system. A fundamentally diﬀer-
ent mechanism for determining charge-localization pro-
cesses becomes available in strong laser ﬁelds.
It was
shown that the intra-molecular localization of electrons
during the dissociation of isolated, small molecules can
be determined by multi-photon processes driven by in-
tense few-cycle laser pulses using their carrier-envelope
phase (CEP) as the control parameter [7–11].

An intriguing yet unexplored question is then, whether
strong-ﬁeld-driven multi-photon processes can inﬂuence
the localization of charge not only within one molecule
but also across system boundaries. Widely used model-
systems for investigating inter-system transfer reactions
are small van der Waals (vdW) clusters and dimers.
VdW dimers are used to study photoinduced biological
processes [12–14], photocatalytic reactions [15, 16], and
energy or charge transfer reactions induced by soft X-
ray photons [17–20] and electron impact [21]. VdW sys-
tems are also studied with strong laser ﬁelds, but in the
case of dimers with a focus on the ﬁeld-driven ionization
and fragmentation dynamics [22–35], or electronic energy
conversion processes in the case of larger clusters [36–41].
To the best of our knowledge, strong-ﬁeld driven electron
transfer-reactions across the system boundary from one
entity to another have thus far not been investigated.

In this Letter, we show experimentally and by simula-
tions, using the argon dimer, Ar2, as an example, that
electron transfer-reactions from one argon atom to the
other can be driven by a strong laser ﬁeld and, further-
more, that they are decisive for the ionization and frag-
mentation behavior of the dimer. Speciﬁcally, we demon-
strate that an electron liberated at one of the two Ar
atoms can be captured by the neighboring atom. This
process, which we refer to as the laser-induced trans-
fer of electron (LITE) process, determines the emission
timing of the electrons via electron-electron interaction
and thus, depending on the CEP, inﬂuences the mo-
menta of the emitted electrons. As a result, the eﬀect of
LITE can be observed in our experiments and simulations
when comparing the asymmetry of electron emission as
a function of CEP for the two ionization-fragmentation
channels Ar(1,2) and Ar(2,2), where Ar(n, m) denotes
Ar2

→ Arn+ + Arm+.
In our experiments, argon dimers created by super-
sonic expansion of a few bars of argon gas were ionized
by intense laser pulses, linearly polarized along z, with
a full width at half maximum (FWHM) duration in in-
tensity of 4.5 fs and a peak intensity, calibrated in in situ
[42], of 5 × 1014 W cm−1, inside the ultra-high vacuum
chamber of a reaction microscope [43]. Details on the
reaction microscope can be found in Refs. [44–46]. The
laser center wavelength was λ = 750 nm. The dura-
tion of the pulses and their CEP were measured with
a stereo electron spectrometer in phase-tagging mode
[47]. Upon laser ionization of the argon dimers, the two
vdW-bound argon atoms, separated by their equilibrium
internuclear distance (Req) undergo fragmentation via

phase shift of about 0.23π to that of the Ar(1,2) channel.
To understand this experimentally observed CEP-shift
between the two channels, we traced the correlated elec-
trons and the motion of the nuclei in the combined laser
and Coulomb ﬁelds by performing a 3D classical ensemble
model calculation [34, 49], described in Suppl. Mat. [48].
As the laser intensity is well above the over-the-barrier
threshold [50] the two outermost electrons are rapidly
stripped from each argon atom [49]. We therefore did
not model these two initial ionization events and instead
started from a dimer consisting of two singly charged ar-
gon ions (Ar+- Ar+), with one active electron situated
around the position of each ion.

The CEP-dependence of Az predicted by the simula-
tions for the Ar(1,2) and Ar(2,2) channels is shown in
Fig. 2(b). The simulated curves agree very well with
the measured ones, in particular the CEP left-shift of
the Ar(2,2) channel is very well reproduced. The ori-
gin of this phase-shift can be extracted from the simu-
lations by analyzing the distributions of ionization times
t1st and t2nd > t1st of the laser-driven electron trajec-
tories that lead to the channels Ar(1,2) and Ar(2,2), re-
spectively. The ionization time t1st marks the instant
at which the single-particle energy of the ﬁrst emitted
electron becomes positive for the ﬁrst time. Likewise,
t2nd marks this instant for the second emitted electron
in the Ar(2,2) channel. The distributions of t1st and t2nd
are plotted in Figs. 2(c)-(h) for the Ar(1,2) and Ar(2,2)
channels and three selected values of the CEP. For con-
venience of the following discussion, the ionization time-
distributions were separated depending on whether the
(sum) momentum of the electron (pair) reaches positive
(upper halves) or negative momentum (lower halves).

z

To explain the CEP left-shift between Ar(1,2) and
Ar(2,2), we start with the CEP-dependence of A(1,2)
. As
shown in Figs. 2(c)-(e), the distributions of the ioniza-
tion times (t1st) in this channel feature two maxima per
peak of the laser ﬁeld. The reason underlying these two
maxima will be explained below. For ϕCEP = 0, the
two maxima corresponding to the ﬁeld peak at tA are
marked by cyan and yellow boxes [Fig. 2(c)]. The max-
ima corresponding to the ﬁeld peaks at tB and tC are
much smaller for ϕCEP = 0. The emission directions
of electrons set free during these maxima (up or down,
indicated by positive or negative time-distributions) are
largely determined by the laser vector potential accord-
ing to the relation pe1 = −A(ti) = (cid:82) ti
−∞ E(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48) [51, 52]
with ti the ionization time. Positive values of A(ti) are
indicated by gray shading in Figs. 2(c)-(h). The small
deviations from pe1 = −A(ti) are due to the Coulomb
forces of the argon ions.

For ϕCEP = 0, most of the trajectories are emitted
with pe1 < 0. Therefore, A(1,2)
has a large negative
value, cf. Figs. 2(a,b). For increasing CEP, the laser ﬁeld-
maximum at tB shifts closer to the pulse peak and be-

By imposing momentum conservation conditions onto the

to momentum conservation, the sum momentum of the

mass of argon, for the Ar(1,1), Ar(1,2) and Ar(2,2) chan-
nels. For each channel, at least two characteristic main
peaks can be identiﬁed. The smaller peaks at higher
KER-values (marked by arrows) were attributed to the
process of frustrated tunnel ionization [22–24]. The dom-
inant peaks at lower KER-values, highlighted by colored
areas in Fig. 1(a), originate from Coulomb explosions of
the argon dimers at Req and are the focus of this work.
To obtain insight into the multiple ionization dynam-
ics underlying the colored lower-KER peaks in Fig. 1(a),
we introduce an asymmetry-parameter A(n,m)
= (nup −
ndn)/(nup + ndn), where nup (ndn) denote for the chan-
nel Ar(n,m) the number of events with a positive (neg-
ative) electron sum momentum along z. Alternatively
to A(n,m)
, one could also analyze the mean electron sum
z
momentum ¯p(n,m)
. But as we show in Suppl. Mat. [48],
the two quantities feature an almost identical dependence
on the CEP. In the following we will use A(n,m)
, as it has
the advantage that it can be visually connected to elec-
tron yields discussed below. The measured dependence
of Az on CEP for the Ar(1,2) and Ar(2,2) channels is
depicted in Fig. 2(a). The key feature in Fig. 2(a) is that
the Az-curve for the Ar(2,2) channel exhibits a clear left

comes stronger. Accordingly, the positive valued double-
peak structure corresponding to the ﬁeld maximum at tB
becomes gradually larger; at ϕCEP = 0.5π the negative
and positive double-peak structures are roughly equal in
area. As a consequence, A(1,2)
varies from a large neg-
z
ative value at ϕCEP = 0 to roughly 0 at ϕCEP = 0.5π.
Thus, the CEP-dependence of A(1,2)
in Figs. 2(a,b) can
to a good degree be explained straightforwardly using
standard strong-ﬁeld arguments based on the relation
pe1 = −A(ti) and the sub-cycle dependence of the ion-
ization rate on CEP.

z

z

To explain the CEP-dependence of A(2,2)

for Ar(2,2),
also the distribution of t2nd, blue-colored in Fig. 2, must
be considered. The distributions of t1st in the Ar(2,2)
channel, although diﬀerent in amplitude from those of
channel Ar(1,2), are also dominated by two peaks per
laser cycle.
In contrast, the distribution of t2nd for
ϕCEP = 0 in Fig. 2(f) is dominated by only one peak.
It is delayed by a laser-half-cycle to the strongest ﬁeld
maximum at tA and points into the negative direction.
Again, the reasons for the delay and the single peak-
structure will be discussed below. Together with the t1st
peaks that also point into the negative direction, this
single t2nd peak leads to A(2,2)
< 0 for ϕCEP = 0, in
z
agreement with Figs. 2(a,b). As the CEP increases, the
half-cycle-delayed negative t2nd peak due to the decreas-
ing ﬁeld-maximum at tA becomes weaker, and the posi-
tive t2nd peak due to the increasing ﬁeld maximum at tB
becomes stronger. Together with the t1st distributions
that behave similarly as in the Ar(1,2) case, this causes
that A(2,2)
z moves towards positive values, reaches ≈ 0 for
ϕCEP = 0.3π and a large positive value for ϕCEP = 0.5π
[see Figs. 2(a,b)].

We now turn to discussing the origin of the t1st double-

z

z

peak and the half-cycle delayed single-peak structure of
t2nd. As we will see, this will also explain the CEP
relative to A(1,2)
left-shift of A(2,2)
. To this end, we
traced the classical trajectories leading to the Ar(2,2)
channel. For simplicity, but without loss of generality, we
select for this in-depth analysis the electron pairs emitted
within [−0.25T, 0.75T ] and with negative sum momen-
tum for the case of ϕCEP = 0 [indicated by a green box
in Fig. 2(f)]. The resulting time-distributions, displayed
in Fig. 3(a), show that the emissions can be classiﬁed into
two types according to the relative emission time of the
ﬁrst and second electrons: One, where the two emissions
happen isolated of each other (t1st ∈ [−0.25T, 0.25T ]),
and a second one, where the two emission steps hap-
pen in a concerted manner within the same half-cycle
(t1st ∈ [0.25T, 0.75T ]).

Typical trajectories for both the isolated and concerted
case are displayed in Fig. 3. We show in the Suppl. Mat.
[48] that they are representative for all emitted trajecto-
ries. The trajectories for the isolated case of double ion-
ization (DI) [Figs. 3(b,c)] show that the ﬁrst electron is
immediately ﬂying away from its own parent nucleus (red
curve). The second electron, in contrast, is transferred
to the other nucleus, where it is subsequently temporally
captured by the Coulomb potential of the neighboring
Ar2+ ion. It becomes ionized only during the next laser-
half-cycle around the peak of the ﬁeld. We refer to this
electron transfer process across the system boundaries
and the subsequent capture process that results in the
ionization delay as LITE.

LITE also plays a signiﬁcant role in the concerted type
of DI. Two cases can be distinguished: Representative
electron trajectories [Figs. 3(d,e)] show that for case 1
one of the electrons is emitted at one site and trans-
ferred to the other site by LITE. There it is captured by

FIG. 4: Simulated CEP-dependence of the asymmetry Az
for channels Ar(1,2) and Ar(2,2). The latter is separated
into isolated and concerted two-electron emissions based on
∆t = t1st − tA,B,C , where tA,B,C (indicated in Fig. 2) are
the instants of the laser ﬁeld-maxima right before a given t1st
peak that initiates the electron emission at t1st: Isolated for
0 ≤ ∆t ≤ 0.25T , concerted for 0.25T ≤ ∆t ≤ 0.5T .

This second case is reminiscent of the recollision-
induced excitation with subsequent ﬁeld ionization
(RESI) process well-known for monomers [53–55]. Here,
however, the collision-excitation step takes place on a dis-
tant entity and is enabled only by a preceding LITE pro-
cess. Further explanations and a visualization of the role
of LITE in the three diﬀerent DI scenarios, as well as ad-
ditional data and discussion on the role of the alignment
of the argon dimer with respect to the laser polariza-
tion direction, the correlation between the two emitted
electrons due to the collisions induced by LITE, and a
spatio-temporal analysis of the electron transfer is pro-
vided in the Suppl. Mat. [48].

The ﬁnding that the DI dynamics to Ar(2,2) is dom-
inated by an electron transfer process (LITE), explains
why the second electron emission is delayed by a laser
half-cycle to its initiating laser ﬁeld-peak [cf.
the t2nd
distributions in Figs. 2(f)-(h)]. Likewise, also the double-
peak structure of t1st can be explained by LITE: In the
concerted cases of DI the ﬁrst electron is transferred and
therefore is emitted with delay, giving rise to the second
peak. The ﬁrst, undelayed peak arises during the isolated
cases of DI and during single ionization (SI) to Ar(1,2).
The delayed peak in SI corresponds to cases where the
ﬁrst electron becomes transferred but the second electron
stays bound, see Suppl. Mat. [48] for further details.

and A(2,2)

Finally, based on the fact that the ﬁrst ionization step
proceeds similarly for the Ar(1,2) and Ar(2,2) channels
[cf. Figs. 2(c)-(h)], we can now investigate which of the
two DI cases, the isolated or the concerted one, is re-
sponsible for the distinct CEP-shift observed between
the A(1,2)
curves in Figs. 2(a,b). To see this,
z
we plot in Fig. 4 A(2,2)
separately for the isolated and
concerted contributions to Ar(2,2), in comparison with
A(1,2)
taken from Fig. 2(b). The separated curves re-
z
veal that the uncorrelated two-electron emission of the
isolated case introduces a notable shift, but the main
shift is introduced by the concerted pathway. The rea-

the Coulomb potential, collides with the second electron
initially on this site, and produces a doubly excited neu-
tral atom, i.e., an Ar2+-Ar∗∗ dimer. The highly excited
Ar∗∗ atom is then doubly ionized before the next peak
of the laser ﬁeld, resulting in an Ar(2,2) dimer. Case 2
[Figs. 3(f,g)] starts similarly: An electron is emitted at
one site and is transferred to the other by LITE. How-
ever, in this case the energy exchange by collisions with
the second electron is larger, so that one of the electrons
gains enough energy to ionize soon. The other electron
loses some of its energy and is trapped by the Coulomb
potential, forming a transient Ar2+-Ar+∗ complex. The
captured electron ﬁnally ionizes at or after the next peak
of the laser ﬁeld and produces an Ar(2,2) dimer.

tion dynamics triggered in the excited argon atom upon
electron-transfer by LITE leads to electron emission over
a much broader range of time within the laser cycle as
compared to a purely ﬁeld-driven ionization dynamics
conﬁned to around the crests of the laser cycle.

In conclusion, we have experimentally and theoreti-
cally studied the ionization-fragmentation dynamics of
argon dimers in intense few-cycle laser pulses with a
known CEP. We observe a distinct CEP-shift of the elec-
tron emission asymmetry between the Ar+ + Ar2+ and
Ar2+ + Ar2+ fragmentation channels. Using a classical
ensemble model we ﬁnd that this CEP-shift is due to
electron-electron interaction mediated by a ﬁeld-driven
electron transfer process (LITE) from one argon atom
to the other. Our work, thus, heralds the possibility
to use strong laser ﬁelds for controlling sub-cycle inter-
molecular electron-transfer processes where the trans-
ferred electron can excite electronic dynamics on a dis-
tant molecule. This ﬁnding opens up a new route for
controlling molecular processes with intense laser pulses
beyond mere bond-breaking reactions.
