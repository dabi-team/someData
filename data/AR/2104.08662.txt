Abstract. We present our AstroSat soft X-ray observations of a compact binary system, AR Sco, and analysis
of its X-ray observations with Chandra that were taken only about a week before the AstroSat observations. An
analysis of the soft X-ray (0.3 − 2.0 keV) data limits the modulation of the spin, orbital, or beat periods to less than
0.03 counts s−1 or <10% of the average count rate. The X-ray ﬂux obtained from both observatories is found to
be almost identical (within a few percent) in ﬂux, and about 30% lower than reported from the nine months older
observations with XMM-Newton. A two-temperature thermal plasma model with the same spectral parameters ﬁt
Chandra and AstroSat data very well, and requires very little absorption in the line of sight to the source. The low-
temperature component has the same temperature (∼1 keV) as reported earlier, but the high-temperature component
has a lower temperature of 5.0+0.8
−0.7 keV as compared to 8.0 keV measured earlier, however, the diﬀerence is not
statistically signiﬁcant.

1. Introduction

1

A uniquely variable star, AR Scorpii (AR Sco) was ini-
tially mis-classiﬁed as a pulsating δ-Scuti type (Saty-
valdiev, V. 1971). The star is at a distance of 117±1 pc
based on parallax measurements given in Gaia Early
Data Release 3 by Gaia Collaboration, Brown et al.
(2020), with statistical error as given at the Gaia web-
site.
It gained prominence when it was identiﬁed
as a rare radio pulsing white dwarf (WD) binary sys-
tem by Marsh et al.
(2016). A very short spin pe-
riod of Ps=117.1 s, and a synodic (spin−orbital beat)
period, Pb=118.2 s and its harmonics, with very high
amplitudes of Pb in the ultraviolet, optical and infra-
red were found by Marsh et al. (2016). These periods
were also seen at radio frequencies, and a slowing of the
synodic period ( ˙Pb=3.92×10−13s s−1) was also reported

by Marsh et al (2016), thus implying a time-scale of
107 years for synchronization. However, in more recent
photometric studies by Stiller et al. (2018) and Gaibor
et al. (2020), the latter from data taken over a 5 year
baseline, a larger spin down rate of ˙Pb=6.82×10−13s
s−1 is derived, implying a commensurate decrease in
the synchonization time.

Marsh et al.

(2016) concluded that AR Sco is a
close binary system consisting of a WD and a cool low-
mass M-star, with an orbital period of 3.56 h. They fur-
ther pointed out that AR Sco is primarily spin-down
powered, and its broadband spectral energy distribu-
tion is well explained by synchrotron radiation from
relativistic electrons which likely originate from near
the WD or are generated in situ at the M star surface
through a direct interaction with the WD’s magneto-
sphere. Marsh et al. also reported on a short X-ray ob-
servation of AR Sco using the Swift X-ray Telescope
(XRT) that showed the X-ray luminosity of AR Sco
is very low (∼ 5 × 1030 ergs−1) and therefore, accre-

tion is not suﬃcient to power the system. In some re-
spects AR Scorpii resembles the cataclysmic variable
AE Aquarii (Ikhsanov 1998, Meintjes & Venter 2005,
Oruru & Meintjes 2012), which has a 33 s white dwarf
spin period and a ˙Pb=5.66×10−14s s−1 and is in a pro-
peller mass ejection phase, i.e., a system with very lit-
tle or no mass accretion. However, as pointed out by
Marsh et al. (2016) and Buckley et al. (2017), no ﬂick-
ering or broad emission lines in the optical are seen in
AR Sco, in contrast to AE Aqr. This implies that the
system is detached, with little or no mass loss from the
secondary star, and therefore by deﬁnition is not a cat-
aclysmic variable.

AR Sco also exhibits strong (up to ∼ 40%) linear
polarization in the optical, modulated strongly at Ps and
Pb (Buckley et al. 2017; Potter & Buckley 2018a),
which Buckley et al. used to derive an estimate of
the white dwarf’s magnetic ﬁeld of B∼108 Gauss at
its surface. Such a large ﬁeld was also shown to be
consistent with the system being powered by dipole ra-
diation of the slowing down white dwarf, caused by
the magnetic torque between the white dwarf and sec-
ondary star. A recent model proposed by Lyutikov et
al.
(2020) attempts to explain the properties of AR
Sco with a lower white dwarf magnetic ﬁeld, closer
to what is seen in the intermediate polar sub-class of
magnetic CVs, which would more easily explain the
initial spin-up of the white dwarf. However, the cur-
rent large spin-down rate, coupled to the very diﬀer-
ent polarimetric properties of AR Sco compared to in-
termediate polars, may be argue against a lower ﬁeld
strength. Optical photo-polarimetry and photometry by
Potter & Buckley (2018a,b) has identiﬁed several har-
monic components of the spin and beat periods, and
they have suggested a model in which the optical polar-
ized emission comes from two diametrically opposed
synchrotron emission regions in the magnetosphere of
the WD, consistent with the model proposed by Takata
et al. (2018). Finally, work by du Plessis et al. (2019),
where the RVM (rotating vector model) for pulsars was
successfully applied to the AR Sco polarimetric obser-
vations, is added evidence for the presence of a rotating
magnetic dipole in AR Sco.

AR Sco was observed in the UV and X-rays with
XMM-Newton by Takata et al. (2018), who found or-
bital modulation, but with no evidence of eclipses or ab-
sorption features. The XMM-Newton data also showed
strong X-ray pulsations at the synodic beat frequency
νb (=νs - νo) of 8.461100 mHz (Pb=118.2s), where νs is
the spin frequency at 8.5390 mHz (117.11 s) and νo is
the orbital frequency at 0.07792 mHz (3.56 h). These
modulations are seen mostly in the soft energy band of
0.15-2.0 keV (Takata et al. 2018). They also reported
a very weak signal corresponding to the side-band fre-

quency of νs + νo. The pulse proﬁles were similar in
UV and soft X-rays thus suggestive of similar origin,
though the pulse modulation in UV is about 3 times
higher than in X-rays.

The phase averaged X-ray spectrum reported by
Takata et al.
(2018) was best ﬁt by two-temperature
(1.1 keV and 8.0 keV) plasma emission models and
even better ﬁt by a three-temperature (0.6, 1.7 and 8.0
keV) plasma model with solar abundance, with total
ﬂux of 3.2×10−12ergs cm−2 s−1 in the energy band of
0.15 - 12 keV (Takata et al. 2018). The low absorp-
tion column density, NH of 4×1020 cm−2 and X-ray
luminosity of 4×1030 ergs s−1 are very diﬀerent from
that seen in intermediate polars. The X-ray emission
likely arises from a non-thermally heated plasma and
the system appears to be a WD analogue of a neutron
star radio pulsar, although no direct evidence is found
for the presence of a non-thermal component in the X-
ray spectrum. Data analyzed in the energy range from
100 MeV to 500 GeV from Fermi Large Area Telescope
(LAT) for the period August 4, 2008 to March 31, 2019,
did not lead to any statistically signiﬁcant detection ei-
ther (Singh et al. 2020). The exact emission mecha-
nism operating in AR Sco, therefore, continues to be a
mystery.

Here, we present X-ray observations of AR Sco
with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the AstroSat
Soft X-ray telescope carried out just a few days apart
from each other.

2. Observations

2.1 Chandra X-ray Observatory

AR Sco was observed with the Advanced CCD Imag-
ing Spectrometer (ACIS-I) onboard the Chandra X-ray
Observatory (CXO) from 2017 June 23, 23H:36M:13S
to June 24, 07H:25M:59S. The data from this obser-
vation (Observation ID: 19711) were downloaded from
archives maintained by NASA and analysed with Chan-
dra Interactive Analysis of Observations (CIAO) soft-
ware version 4.12. Each dataset was reprocessed with
the most recently-available calibration (CALDB ver-
sion 4.9.1 ) applied to it using the chandra repro script.
The reprocessing created a new level 2 event ﬁle for
each dataset which was used in all further analyses. The
level 2 event ﬁles were ﬁltered for Solar Particle ﬂares
by analysing their light curves (LCs), and a useful ex-
posure time of 24790 s was obtained.

2.2 AstroSat Soft X-ray Telescope

AstroSat (Singh et al. 2014) observed AR Sco with the
Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) (Singh et al. 2016, 2017)

J. Astrophys. Astr. (0000)000: ####

as the prime instrument in the photon counting (PC)
mode. SXT observed the source throughout an orbit of
the satellite taking care that the Sun avoidance angle is
≥ 45◦ and RAM angle (the angle between the payload
axis to the velocity vector direction of the spacecraft)
> 12◦ to ensure the safety of the mirrors and the de-
tector. The observation (Observation ID 9000001350)
was started on 2017 June 30 at 06H:36M:51S UT and
ended on 2017 Jul 2 at 10H:13M:53S UT. Level 1 Data
from individual orbits were received at the SXT POC
(Payload Operation Centre) from the ISSDC (Indian
Space Science Data Center). These data were pro-
cessed with the sxtpipeline, available in the SXT soft-
ware (AS1SXTLevel2, version 1.4b), thus calibrating
the source events and extracting Level-2 cleaned event
ﬁles for the individual orbits. The cleaned event ﬁles
of all the orbits were then merged into a single cleaned
event ﬁle using a Julia-based merger tool developed by
G. C. Dewangan to avoid the time-overlapping events
from the consecutive orbits. The XSELECT (V2.4d)
package was used to extract the source spectra and light
curves from the processed Level-2 cleaned event ﬁles
and a useful exposure time of 53610 sec was obtained.

3. Analysis and Results

An X-ray image of AR Sco obtained with the Chandra
ACIS is shown in Figure 1. The source lies towards
the edge of the ﬁeld-of-view. A circular region of 7
arcsec radius was used for extraction of counts from the
source. A box region of size 136”x93” in the vicinity
of the source was selected as the background region.

Figure 1. Chandra X-ray image of AR Sco in the energy
band of 0.3-7.0 keV showing the source region (circle)
and the background region (rectangle) for the extraction of
photons used in the analysis.

An X-ray image of AR Sco taken with the SXT is

shown in Figure 2. Source counts were extracted from
a circular region of 10 arcmin radius centered on AR
Sco. Both a light curve and a spectrum were extracted
from this region for further analysis.

of 0.3-7.1 keV showing the circular extraction region of 10
arcmin radius for source counts. Smoothing by a Gaussian
with kernel of 3 pixel radius (1 pixel=4 arcsec) has been
applied.

3.1 X-ray Light curves

The X-ray light curve in the energy range of 0.3 - 7.0
keV obtained from Chandra observations is shown in
Figure 3. The task ’dmextract’ was used to generate
the background subtracted source light curve shown. A
binsize of 3.364s was used for extraction. The back-
ground region was supplied via the ’dmextract’ task pa-
rameter ’bkg’.

The SXT light curve of AR Sco was extracted in
the useful energy band of 0.3 − 7.1 keV and is shown in
Figure 4. The light curve was extracted with the highest
time resolution of 2.3775s. We also extracted the light
curves in the soft energy band of 0.3-2.0 keV from both
the Chandra and SXT data, where most of the modula-
tion was seen by Takata et al. (2018), and studied their
power spectra.

Barycentric corrections are applied to both of the
light curves shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The light curves are
analyzed using the algorithm of Bretthorst (1988). This
algorithm is a formal derivation of the discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) using Bayesian statistics and is a gen-
eralization of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (see Ap-
pendix A). The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the re-
sulting power spectra for the 0.3–2.0 keV energy band

Chandra observation was used for extraction of spec-
tra and responses (Ancillary Response Function (ARF)
and spectral Response Matrix File (RMF)) with the
CIAO task ’specextract’. The background region was
supplied via the task parameter ’bkgﬁle’. The param-
eter ’correctpsf=yes’ was used to apply point-source
aperture correction to the source ARF ﬁle.

The source spectra from both the observations were
grouped using the grppha tool to ensure a minimum of
25 counts per energy bin, prior to further analysis here
and below. The average spectra obtained after back-
ground subtraction are shown in Figure 8. We obtained
a net count rate of 0.17 ± 0.0026 s−1 for the Chan-
dra data and 0.034± 0.0012 s−1 in the SXT spectrum
in the energy range 0.7−7.0 keV, used for a joint spec-
tral analysis. We conﬁned ourselves to the low energy
limit of 0.7 keV instead of 0.3 keV as the background
subtraction for this very weak source in the SXT indi-
cated almost negligible ﬂux below 0.7 keV while the
ﬂux in the Chandra data at this low energy was slightly
higher. This small discrepancy below 0.7 keV, though
not statistically signiﬁcant, would have compromised
the value of the column density obtained. A line at 6.7
keV is observed clearly (Figure 8) in the X-ray spec-
trum obtained from the Chandra observations. The line
which is very close to the line expected from ionised Fe
XXV indicates thermal emission in the source.

The two spectra were ﬁtted jointly with a simple
plasma emission models apec using the xspec program
(version 12.9.1; Arnaud (1996) distributed with the
heasoft package (version 6.20)). The atomic data base
AtomDB version 3.0.7 (http : //www.atomdb.org),
was used. We used a common absorber model Tbabs
as a multiplicative model with the model parameter NH,
i.e., the equivalent Galactic neutral hydrogen column
density. The plasma temperature (kT) and NH parame-
ter were kept free, at least initially. We used the abun-
dance table (cid:48)aspl(cid:48) given by Asplund et al. (2009) for
our analysis, and the abundances of all the elements
were tied together and could be varied together with re-
spect to the solar values as one parameter. The normal-
isation for the plasma component was kept free for the
two spectra, and χ2 minimisation technique was used
to ﬁnd the best ﬁt parameters. The column density, NH,

and AstroSat data injected with a 0.03 counts s−1 Poisson

of Chandra and AstroSat are shown in Figures 5 and
6, respectively. Neither ﬁgure shows a signal (or peak)
having a S/N ratio of > 5, or equivalently a signiﬁcance
of > 99%, indicating that no signal is detected. Fig-
ure 7 shows S/N obtained for the combined Chandra
and AstroSat light curves that include an injected sinu-
soidal Poisson signal with an amplitude of 0.03 counts
s−1 at a frequency of 5 mHz. The S/N ratio of the dom-
inant signal is about 3 or a likelihood of >90%. Note
that the S/N ratio decreases quickly from about 3 to 1
between 0.03 to 0.025 counts s−1. Based on this sim-
ulation, any modulation of the spin, orbital, and beat
periods in the combined Chandra and AstroSat soft X-
ray data are limited to less than about 0.03 counts s−1,
or a modulation amplitude of less than about 10%, as-
suming an average count rate of 0.3 counts s−1. Takata
et al. (2018) report an ≈14% pulse fraction of the beat
period in the XMM-Newton 0.15 − 0.20 keV X-ray data
and essentially no modulation in the 2 − 12 keV data
from XMM-Newton, thus indicating that the pulse frac-
tion decreases rapidly with increasing energy. We con-
clude that this spectral characteristic combined with the
lower energy cutoﬀ of the XMM-Newton X-ray band
compared to that of AstroSat (0.15 keV vs 0.3 keV),
and a small change in the X-ray pulse fraction between
the 2016 and 2017 observations, is the reason for the
non-detection of the beat period by AstroSat and Chan-
dra.

3.2 X-ray Spectra

X-ray spectra were extracted from both the Chandra
and SXT observations. The ﬁltered events ﬁle from

#### Page 6 of 1

was ﬁxed at the low value of 0.1×1021 cm−2 after it was
found to be tending toward zero. This simple model,
when ﬁtted to the spectra in the energy range of 0.7 -7.0
keV, gave a good ﬁt with a plasma temperature ∼4 keV
and solar elemental abundances. The best-ﬁt values for
this and other models used for ﬁtting are given in Ta-
ble 1. The normalisation of the apec model for the two
sets of data diﬀer only by ∼7%, most probably due to
systematic diﬀerences in the calibration of the two in-
struments used. The total ﬂux obtained for the energy
band of 0.5-10 keV is found to be (2.5±0.8)×10−12 ergs
cm2 s−1.

Assuming non-solar abundances for all the ele-
ments improved the ﬁt only slightly. We have ex-
plored the possibility of an additional thermal com-
ponent: a black body or a plasma component at dif-
ferent temperature. Addition of either of these gave
a signiﬁcant improvement in the χ2 (and based on
the F-statistic values) as can be seen in Table 1, with
the maximum improvement coming from the addition
of another thermal component. The additional black-
body component was best ﬁt for a temperature of 0.13
keV, but it required a signiﬁcant absorption column
density of 1.8-6.7×1021cm−2 for solar abundances and
2.3-8.2×1021cm−2 (90% conﬁdence range) for non-
solar abundances. The best ﬁt to the two-temperature
plasma models requires a low temperature component
of 0.95+0.20
−0.19 keV and a high temperature component of
5.0+0.8
−0.7 keV, elemental abundance of 0.6±0.3 solar, and
a negligible NH in the range of (0.0-2.1)×1021cm−2.
We also tried two-component mekal plasma models
to compare with the results of Takata et al.
(2018),
and found very similar results, except for the low-
temperature component which gave the best ﬁt for a
temperature of 0.77+0.18
−0.16, slightly lower but consistent
within the errors with that obtained from XMM-Newton
data by Takata et al. (2018).

4. Discussion and Conclusion

Our X-ray observations of AR Sco were carried out in
2017, June-July within a few days of each other with
Chandra and AstroSat SXT, and about nine months af-
ter the XMM-Newton observations (2016 Sept 19). We
ﬁnd that although on average AR Sco appears about
30% fainter this is not statistically signiﬁcant given our
errors. We ﬁnd that the spectral data from the two
instruments can be ﬁt with the same models with re-
markable agreement of normalization to within 7% of
each other. The spectra are clearly thermal as signif-
icant emission due to the presence of an ionised iron
(Fe XXV) line is seen clearly in the Chandra spec-
trum. The Fe line was also reported earlier by Takata

et al. (2018) in the XMM-Newton spectrum. The best-
ﬁt spectral models favour two temperature plasma apec
models with the best ﬁt high temperature (∼5 keV)
component diﬀering from ∼8 keV obtained from XMM-
Newton observations. It should be noted, however, that
the SXT has a negligible eﬀective area above the 7.1
keV limit used here, and Chandra has a very low area
above 8.0 keV, and in this particular case the Chan-
dra data above 7.0 keV were ﬂagged as unusable. This
could be the reason for the diﬀerence in the estimated
high energy component. The low-temperature compo-
nent (∼1 keV) and the low column density (negligible)
are in agreement, however.

The time series analysis of the Chandra and As-
troSat soft X-ray data show no periodicities at the WD
spin period, the orbital period, or the beat period of
the two. We believe that the lack of such periodici-
ties is due to the lower sensitivity of the Chandra and
AstroSat X-ray telescopes compared to that of XMM-
Newton. The XMM light curve contains about 20000
counts, while those of Chandra and AstroSat SXT con-
tain about a factor of ten less or about 2000 counts.
Therefore, the relative noise in the Chandra and As-
troSat periodograms are about a factor of three larger.
We also note that the counting statistics are Poissonian
because of the low count rates, which may increase the
noise in the data caused by quantization error. It is pos-
sible that longer exposures by either of these two tele-
scopes may increase the sensitivity enough to detect a
modulation of the soft X-ray ﬂux.

Appendix A

Arthur Schuster (1905) introduced the periodogram
near the beginning of the 20th century and this algo-
rithmic technique has been discussed by many authors
since that time; including Lomb (1976) and Scargle
(1982) for which the Lomb-Scargle algorithm is known
by the astronomical community. The periodogram
C(ω) is deﬁned as the squared magnitude of the dis-
crete Fourier transform of the data D = d1, d2, ..., dN:

where

R(ω) =

N(cid:88)

i=1

di cos(ωti)

and

I(ω) =

N(cid:88)

i=1

di sin(ωti).

in his Ph.D.

A generalization of the periodogram for any time
series function was derived using Bayesian prin-
thesis (1988).

where f (t) is some analytic expression of the time se-

amplitude of the model, and {ω} is a set of parame-
ters (in our case, frequencies). The Bayesian likelihood
function for data D is

and σ is the standard deviation of the noise. Q is an
m × m matrix that can be orthogonalized, resulting in
a set of eigenvectors of the likelihood equation. There-
fore f (t) can be written in terms of a set of orthonormal
functions:

If σ is unknown, then it’s considered a nuisance pa-
rameter and can be eliminated by integrating over all
values using the Jeﬀreys prior 1/σ. This gives an ex-
pression for the probability of the form of the ”Student
t-distribution”:

Although {A} and σ are described as nuisance pa-
rameters when deriving the likelihood of the frequency
parameters, they are actually of some interest. Bret-
thorst shows in Chapter 4 that the ﬁrst posterior mo-
ments, i.e., the expected amplitudes, are:

(9)

(cid:104)A j(cid:105) = h j,

(10)

the second posterior moments are:

(cid:104)A jAk(cid:105) = h j jk + σ2δ jk,

the noise variance is:

A change of functions (6) and variables (8) gives the

h j is the projection of the data onto the orthonormal
model function H j. Because we have no knowledge of
the amplitudes A j, they need to be marginalized, or in-
tegrated out, by performing j integrations, which gives
the likelihood
