Auger recombination (AR) being electron-hole annihilation with energy-momentum transfer to
another carrier is believed to speed up in materials with small band gap. We theoretically show
that this rule is violated in gapless three-dimensional materials with ultra-relativistic electron-hole
dispersion, Weyl semimetals (WSM). Namely, AR is prohibited by energy-momentum conservation
laws in prototypical WSM with a single Weyl node, even in the presence of anisotropy and tilt. In
real multi-node WSM, the geometric dissimilarity of nodal dispersions enables weak inter-node AR,
which is further suppressed by strong screening due to large number of nodes. While partial AR
rates between the nodes of the same node group are mutually equal, the inter-group processes are
non-reciprocal, so that one of groups is geometrically protected from AR. This geometrical protection
prolongs AR lifetime up to two orders of magnitude, to the level of nanoseconds.

Introduction.— The latest years of condensed matter
physics are marked by an intense search for solid-state re-
alizations of exotic fundamental particles1–3. The unique
electronic properties of graphene4, Weyl5–9, and Dirac10
semimetals enabled the tabletop observation of Klein
tunneling11, supercritical atomic collapse12, axial13 and
axial-gravitational14 anomalies. In this strive for high-
energy physics enabled by electronic properties of novel
materials, less attention is paid to the eﬀects prohibited
by these properties. Such negatory search still can be
fruitful. In particular, suppression of electron scattering,
relaxation, and recombination in solids15–17 would enable
the observation of new phases of ultra-clean matter, not
to say about ultrafast electronic and photonic devices.

In this Letter, we show that quasi-relativistic disper-
sion of fermions in recently discovered Weyl semimetals
(WSM) strongly suppresses the electron-hole recombina-
tion with energy-momentum transfer to another carrier,
known as Auger recombination (AR). The AR is among
key obstacles toward the realization of non-equilibrium
phases of electron-hole liquid18, excitonic19 and Floquet
topological insulators20.
In addition, AR is the pri-
mary ”killer” of population inversion and optical gain
in narrow-gap semiconductor lasers21,22 hindering their
promotion into terahertz range. Numerous attempts to
suppress AR invoked strain-engineering23, modiﬁcation
of wave function proﬁles24, and exchange eﬀects upon
scattering25. However, there has been no material with
”natural” AR suppression as it occurs in WSM.

We further elaborate the incompleteness of analogy be-
tween relativistic electrons and Weyl fermions, and re-
veal its consequences for AR. In real WSM, there exist
multiple Weyl nodes located at low-symmetry points of
the Brillouin zone (Fig. 1), which can be attributed to
one or several node groups (W1 and W2 in TaAs fam-
ily). As a result, the carrier energy spectrum acquires
anisotropy26–28 and tilt. We show that it is the dissim-
ilarity of energy spectra at diﬀerent nodes that enables
weak inter-node recombination, while the intra-node AR
remains prohibited. Similar inter-valley AR was noted
for lead salts29, however, strong suppression of intra-

the latter case, the interband transition occurs in W1 and the
intraband one – in W2 (or vice versa).

valley process was not realized. Adopting the relation
between recombination and dissipative part of polariz-
ability30, we derive an illustrative geometric construction
for evaluation of AR. We use it to reveal the key fea-
tures of interband population inversion dynamics. The
most intriguing one is non-reciprocity of AR between var-
ious node groups, and suppression of AR at nodes with
fast carrier velocity, which we call geometrically protected
population inversion. This protection, along with strong
screening due to large number of nodes, prolongs the non-
radiative lifetimes up to the level of several nanoseconds.

As the mass gap tends to zero and dispersion be-

comes pathological. Momentum conservation for Auger

kh1 are the momenta of recombining electron and hole
(counterpart of positron in solids), ke2 and k′
e2 are the
initial and ﬁnal momenta of ’hot’ electron. The energy
conservation implies ke1 + kh1 + ke2 = k′

ders all four momenta collinear. The phase space for
collinear collisions vanishes. However, the interaction
strength between collinear carriers diverges as their uni-
directional motion with equal velocities implies inﬁnite

To put the solution of AR problem in three dimensions
on a solid ground, we use a transparent yet not widely
adopted relation30 between recombination and imaginary
parts of inter- and intraband polarizations, ImΠ−+ and
ImΠss (here s =
1 is the index of conduction and va-
lence bands). The AR rate in this formalism involves the
product of electron-hole annihilation probability charac-
terized by ImΠ−+ , the squared amplitude of virtual pho-
ton propagation, and the probability of interband photon
absorption ImΠss. The formal expression for the rate of

transform implies that anisotropy and tilt of dispersion
translates in the respective deformation of the ”excitation
cone”. As a result, the inter- and intra-band excitations
within the same node still do not overlap in the pres-
ence of tilt and anisotropy, and intra-node AR remains
forbidden.

At the same time, deformation of the Weyl cones opens
up the inter-node recombination channel. Geometrically,
the overlap between inter- and intraband excitations in
diﬀerent nodes can be produced both by diﬀerent orienta-
tion of velocity tensors, tilt, and diﬀerent absolute values
of Weyl velocity (in multi-group WSM). These possibil-
ities are illustrated in Fig. 2(c-e). As far as diﬀerence
in dispersion of the nodes is small, the partial AR rate
involving the nodes i and j, R(s)

A striking feature of inter-node AR is its non-reciprocity,
i.e.
the absence of recombination in the group with
fastest Weyl velocity v⋆. Indeed, the virtual photon with
momentum q < ω/v⋆ emitted upon e-h annihilation in
”fast” group cannot be absorbed in ”slow” nodes (while
the opposite is possible). Thus, this peculiar ”fast”
node is geometrically protected from AR, provided the
anisotropy and tilt are weak. Below we show that geo-
metrical protection elongates the non-radiative lifetime
in real WSM up to several nanoseconds.

Visualization of AR in WSM: temporal dynamics.—
Once the interband population inversion is created in
WSM, its relaxation after relatively fast intraband equi-
libration (due to electron-electron scattering) is governed
by the interband processes. Assuming that AR lifetime
in WSM is shorter than the phonon-limited lifetime39, we
consider the temporal dynamics with AR channel only,

The speciﬁc band structure of WSM imprints on AR
rates already in materials with single node group (as
expected in strained HgTe40). Particularly, the rate at
strong pumping (quasi-Fermi level δµ
T ) never follows
the p3-law inherent to common semiconductors. The su-
perseding dynamics is summarized in Table I and Fig. 3.
Strong deviations from p3-law occur due to carrier de-
generacy and screening. The latter is proportional to the
total number of nodes η =
n ηn (24 in TaAs family and
8 in strained HgTe). This makes the total AR rate (al-
P
most) independent of the nodal degeneracy and the life-
times – nearly proportional to η, thus enhancing them
by more than an order of magnitude. Strong pumping
of intrinsic nodes (equilibrium Fermi level µ = 0) results
in sub-exponential relaxation, while strong pumping of
extrinsic ones (µ
T ) – in super-exponential one. Re-
combination at weak pumping and/or at ﬁnal stages is,
as expected, exponential. It is faster in extrinsic nodes
by almost an order of magnitude due to the parabolic
density of states in WSM.

If all eigenvalues of the Weyl velocity

nel of AR for W1 is locked. Additionally, the intra-group
channel is suppressed due to screening by the resident
carriers at W2. The band structure of TaAs, the ﬁrst ex-
perimentally discovered WSM, favours such scenario. It
possesses almost intrinsic 8-fold degenerate node group
W1, and extrinsic 16-fold degenerate node group W2 with

pression of AR due to phase space restrictions imposed
by energy and momentum conservation. The only al-
lowed Auger process involves scattering between Weyl
nodes with dissimilar carrier dispersion laws . In compar-
ison to graphene, the carrier lifetimes in realistic WSM
are elongated by several orders of magnitude thanks to
(1) ”geometrical” restrictions in phase space and (2)
strong screening of Coulomb interaction proportional to
the number of nodes.

The most striking feature of the inter-group AR in
WSM is the geometrical protection of the population
inversion in the ”fastest” node group W⋆, where the
rate of this process vanishes. The persistent recombi-
nation channels due to velocity anisotropy and tilt can
be strongly suppressed if W⋆ is intrinsic and there are
enough carriers outside of it to provide strong screening.
As a result, the lifetimes up to 10−8 s can be achieved in
WSM with geometrically protected node group. Experi-
mental studies of TaAs support the desired band struc-
ture, so the proposed scenario is highly realistic.

Our preliminary estimates show that account of dy-
namic screening further suppresses AR, as the real part
of the screening function has a logarithmic singularity at
the edge of the excitation cone41. This would result in an
extra large log factor in carrier lifetime, order of ln2
−1.
All these results allow us to consider WSM as promising
candidates for long-lasting non-equilibrium states and ef-
ﬁcient coherent terahertz emission.

We note, that the given expression for ARR is valid only if the dielectric function has no singularities in the frequency
range [˜ωi(Q), ˜ωj(Q)]. Otherwise, the ǫ(ω) dependence should be taken into account when calculating the integral
over ω. Analogically, due to the small diﬀerence in nodes’ i and j dispersions, qij ≈
q. Thus, integration over q and

Intra-group AR enabled by in-plane velocity anisotropy

In the W1 node group of TaAs, the Weyl velocity tensors has the form

where ϕi = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2. We evaluate the geometrical factor
ϕj = π/2 as an example. The explicit form of their velocity tensors is

Inter-group AR

The recombination between diﬀerent node groups is enabled already by the diﬀerence of absolute values of Weyl

velocities. For this reason, we omit tilt and consider velocity tensor as isotropic

ˆv(i) = ˆv(1) = v1δlm
ˆv(j) = ˆv(2) = v2δlm,

(S40)

(S41)

and the process is allowed only if v2 > v1. In this recombination mechanism, no symmetry relations between nodes
are required and the smallness of the domain of allowed (ω, q) is guaranteed by proximity of v2 and v1. Therefore

C. Tilt-enabled AR

(S42)

(S43)

(S44)

To highlight the eﬀect of tilt-enabled AR, we omit the velocity anisotropy from consideration and take the velocity

tensors of i-th and j-th nodes to be

The tilt vectors of the nodes can be, however, diﬀerent

ˆv(i,j) = v0δlm.

u(i) = (u(i)
u(j) = (u(j)

x , u(i)
x , u(j)

y , u(i)
z )
y , u(j)
z ).

(S45)

(S46)

(S47)

The indices i and j can belong to diﬀerent groups (Wn and Wn′ ) or to one group. In the latter case, the tilt vectors
are related via symmetry operations. In particular, for a pair of nodes from Sec. IIIA:

u(i) = (u(i)
x , u(i)
y , u(i)
u(i)
u(j) = (

y , u(i)
z )
x , u(i)
z ).

−

(S48)

(S49)

We note that in the case of tilt-enabled AR, the vectors u(j) and u(i) should not necessarily be close to each other.
Indeed, the smallness of domain of allowed frequencies ω is governed by

and is enabled by the smallness of u(i,j) as compared with Weyl velocity v0. Using the Weyl parameters from Sec.
IIIA, we obtain

∆(eq) =

(u(j)

IV. STATISTICAL FACTOR AND SCREENING

In this section, we give explicit expressions for statistical factors corresponding to various initial occupations and

pumping regimes and provide the particular form of distributions and dielectric functions used to calculate them.

Intra-group recombination. Sub-exponential relaxation in the intrinsic node group.

Intra-group recombination. Super-exponential relaxation in the extrinsic node group.

We consider strong pumping of n-doped node of WSM, such that the Fermi levels obey the inequalities

µv| ≪
where µ is the Fermi level at equilibrium, and the non-equilibrium value is µc = µ + δµc. The pumping is assumed
to be strong enough to push the hole quasi-Fermi level into valence band, µv < 0. Due to the high density of the
residual carries µc remains almost unaﬀected.

V. DISCUSSION OF THE RELAXATION DYNAMICS IN MULTI-GROUP WSM

In multi-group WSM the picture of relaxation becomes much more complicated. For two node groups, W1 and W2,
there are non-equilibrium densities p1,2 appended to the equilibrium ones of rather n-type or p-type, with degenerate,
non-degenerate or intermediate statistics, depending on temperature. In addition, there are two relaxation channels,
namely intra-group AR and inter-group AR, and the latter leads to interconnection between p1(t) and p2(t), as well as
screening. Also, there is the intra-band Coulomb or phonon-assisted scattering between the carriers occupying diﬀerent
node groups, which tends to equilibrate quasi-Fermi levels of the groups δµ1,2. However, such processes involve large
transfer of momentum (equal to distance between pairs of the nodes of W1 and W2), so they are usually slower than
the inter-band processes and are neglected here. Depending on details of a particular system and excitation, the shape
of relaxation can be quite intricate, and even if relaxation within each node group is exponential, the total dynamics
is multi-exponential.

For the multi-group WSM, considered in the main text, AR processes involving the intraband transitions in W1
dominate due to massive occupation of W1. So, relaxation of p2 is governed by the intra-group AR, while the dominant
channel of relaxation of p1 is inter-group AR, which can be locked by the geometry protection.

FIG. S4. Screening function for exponential relaxation via intra-group processes in the extrinsic nodes.

In this section, we consider the relaxation dynamics of the population inversion at unprotected group W1. In the
weak excitation regime carrier distributions in W1 and the valence band of W2 are non-degenerate, so the relaxation
is exponential in both node groups, but with diﬀerent lifetimes given by
