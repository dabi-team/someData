ABSTRACT

Circumbinary disks are common around post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars with a stellar companion on
orbital time scales of a few 100 to few 1000 days. The presence of a disk is usually inferred from the system’s spectral
energy distribution (SED), and conﬁrmed, for a sub-sample, by interferometric observations. We used the Spectro-
Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope to obtain extreme
adaptive optics assisted scattered light images of the post-AGB binary system AR Puppis. Data have been obtained
in the V , I, and H bands. Our observations have produced the ﬁrst resolved images of AR Puppis’ circumbinary disk
and conﬁrm its edge-on orientation. In our high angular-resolution and high dynamic-range images we identify several
structural components such as a dark mid-plane, the disk surface, and arc-like features. We discuss the nature of these
components and use complementary photometric monitoring to relate them to the orbital phase of the binary system.
Because the star is completely obscured by the disk at visible wavelengths, we conclude that the long-term photometric
variability of the system must be caused by variable scattering, not extinction, of star light by the disk over the binary
orbit. Finally, we discuss how the short disk life times and fast evolution of the host stars compared to the ages at
which protoplanetary disks are typically observed make systems like AR Puppis valuable extreme laboratories to study
circumstellar disk evolution and constrain the time scale of dust grain growth during the planet formation process.

1. INTRODUCTION

Low- and intermediate-mass stars (around 1 to 8 M(cid:12))
have their nuclear-burning lives terminated by stellar
wind mass loss on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)
if they are single stars, or possibly by mass transfer to a
companion if they are binary stars. When the hydrogen-
rich envelope of the AGB star becomes very small due
to mass loss, the star can no longer maintain its large ra-
dius and it shrinks. The shrinking causes an increase in
Teﬀ as the object evolves through the post-Asymptotic
Giant Branch (post-AGB) phase, up to Teﬀ ∼ 3 × 104 K
(see van Winckel 2003 for a review), followed by the
planetary nebula and white dwarf phases. Binarity is
thought to be the main driver for breaking the initially
largely spherical envelopes of AGB stars to form bipo-
lar protoplanetary and planetary nebulae (Soker 2004,
2006; Nordhaus & Blackman 2006; De Marco 2009; Bof-
ﬁn et al. 2012). Some binary stars will already interact
when the primary expands during its evolution on the
Red Giant Branch (RGB). Such systems, the dusty post-
RGB stars, have recently been identiﬁed in the Magel-
lanic Clouds (Kamath et al. 2016; Manick et al. 2018).
However, due to observational limitations, the binary
nature and orbital parameters of these systems are yet
to be fully explored.

Many close post-AGB binaries display disk-type spec-
tral energy distributions (SEDs). These are character-
ized by a clear near infrared excess indicating that a
fraction of the expelled circumstellar dust and gas must
be located close to the central star, near the sublimation
radius (van Winckel 2003).
It is now well established
that this feature in the SED indicates the presence of a
stable, compact, Keplerian circumbinary disk, and these
sources are referred to as disk sources (e.g., de Ruyter
et al. 2006; Hillen et al. 2014; Kamath et al. 2014, 2015).
All non-pulsating Galactic post-AGB disk sources are
proven to be binaries with binary orbital time scales of
the order of one to several years and therefore this spe-
ciﬁc characteristic of the SED is closely related to the
binary nature of the central star (van Winckel et al.
2009; Gezer et al. 2015). Many pulsating objects were
also proven to be binaries (e.g., Gorlova et al. 2014;
Manick et al. 2017), however, this is more diﬃcult to
prove as large amplitude pulsations (e.g., of RV Tauri
stars) induce large radial velocity variations. Another
interesting property common to most post-AGB objects
with disk-type SEDs is a peculiar photospheric compo-
sition depleted of refractory elements (Gezer et al. 2015;
Oomen et al. 2018, Kamath & Van Winckel 2018, subm.,
and references therein).

Initially, the study of the morphology and evolution
of post-AGB binaries and their disks was limited to the

analysis of spatially unresolved data of the star and in-
frared excess from the circumstellar dust. From this,
disk sizes (outer radii) of a few 100 AU to 1,000 AU were
inferred (de Ruyter et al. 2006). CO rotational mapping
has conﬁrmed the Keplerian rotation in a sample of sys-
tems (Bujarrabal et al. 2013a) and succeeded to resolve
the large scale gas disks and their kinematics in several
systems (Bujarrabal et al. 2003, 2013b, 2015, 2016, 2017,
2018). Only one similar disk around the central star of
the Red Rectangle (HD 44179) could be imaged in scat-
tered light with the Hubble Space Telescope (Osterbart
et al. 1997; Cohen et al. 2004). The ﬁrst spatially re-
solved size measurements of the inner dust disks in other
systems were obtained using optical long baseline inter-
ferometry at infrared wavelengths (Deroo et al. 2006).
The same technique provided a more detailed view of se-
lected disks (Deroo et al. 2007; Hillen et al. 2014, 2015)
and basic size measurements of the disks in 19 systems
(Hillen et al. 2017). The inner rim of the disk in the
IRAS 08544-4431 post-AGB system, as well as its inner
binary, were resolved in the H-band using interferomet-
ric imaging with VLTI/PIONIER (Hillen et al. 2016).
However, interferometric data are unable to provide the
high dynamic range and image ﬁdelity that direct imag-
ing can provide.

Disks around two less evolved giant stars have recently
been imaged using VLT/SPHERE: L2 Pup is an AGB
star (Kervella et al. 2015) and BP Psc is a ﬁrst ascent
giant star (Zuckerman et al. 2008; de Boer et al. 2017;
Gaia Collaboration 2018). We discuss these cases and
compare them to the post-AGB binary disks in Sect. 5.1.
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst spatially resolved
images of the disk around the post-AGB star AR Pup.
The SED of this system suggested a disk orientation
close to edge-on (Hillen et al. 2017) which is a favorable
case for direct imaging because the disk blocks the direct
star light. We observed the star for our pilot program to
demonstrate the feasibility of resolved imaging of post-
AGB binary disks in the visible using extreme adaptive
optics (AO) systems on 8-m-class telescopes. In Sect. 2
we present a brief summary of the current literature on
AR Pup, relevant to this study. We discuss our observ-
ing strategy and data reduction in Sect. 3. The resulting
images are presented and the observed structural com-
ponents of the disk are discussed in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we
discuss the connection of our imaging results with other
observables of the system, speciﬁcally the shape of its
SED and the photometric variability.
In Sect. 5.3 we
highlight the prospects of using post-AGB binary disks
as a laboratory to studying circumstellar disk evolution
– in particular dust grain growth – and discuss them in
the context of potential scenarios of second generation

Ertel et al.

In Fig. 1 we show selected photometry of the AR Pup
system (see Appendix A for a table), adding measure-
ments from the Herschel SPIRE Point Source Catalog
(Schulz et al. 2017) to the data analyzed in detail by
Hillen et al. (2017). To guide the eye, we overplot an
ATLAS9 model atmosphere (Castelli & Kurucz 2004)
for the stellar parameters of AR Pup, reddened with
E(B − V ) = 0.27 and scaled to match the visible pho-
tometry. A visual inspection clearly reveals the presence
of a near-infared excess, as typically seen for disk-type
sources (Sect. 1). The disk-type SED-based classiﬁca-
tion is further conﬁrmed by the position of AR Pup on
the WISE color-color plot (Gezer et al. 2015). The sys-
tem’s variability is obvious from the scatter of the vari-
ous measurements at similar wavelengths in the visible.
Hillen et al. (2017) found that the total infrared lumi-
nosity is higher than that derived from the dereddened
optical ﬂuxes. They concluded that the disk of AR Pup
must be oriented close to edge-on, so that the visible
component of the SED is likely dominated by scatter-
ing, with most direct star light being blocked by the
optically thick disk.

3. SPHERE DATA

The focus of this work is on high angular-resolution
observations of AR Pup at visible and near-infrared
wavelengths.
These data were obtained with the
extreme adaptive optics (AO) instrument SPHERE
(Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet RE-
search, Beuzit et al. 2008) using its cameras ZIMPOL
(Zurich Imaging Polarimeter, Thalmann et al. 2008)
in the V and I bands, IRDIS (Infra-Red Dual-beam
Imaging and Spectroscopy, Dohlen et al. 2008) in the H
band, and the IFS (integral ﬁeld spectrograph, Claudi
et al. 2008) in the Y to J band.
In this section we
describe the observations and data reduction.

3.1. Observations

Observations were carried out on 2016 Apr 4 in ser-
vice mode (project ID: 097.D-0385, PI: S. Ertel). Ob-
serving conditions were well suited for our high angular-
resolution imaging of the relatively bright target (R ∼
9.5) with a seeing between 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)8 and 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 and thin cir-
rus. The ZIMPOL observations were executed ﬁrst, fol-
lowed by the IRDIS and IFS observations in IRDIFS
mode which combines the two modes for simultaneous
use.
In both cases the observations were paired with
observations of a point spread function (PSF) reference
star (HD 74128 for ZIMPOL, observed after AR Pup,
R = 9.2, HD 75363 for IRDIS, observed before AR Pup,
R = 7.9). Both stars were chosen to have a similar
brightness as AR Pup in the observing bands used so

reddened version are over-plotted. Note that this model does

lengths (see Sect. 5.2 for a detailed discussion).

planet formation on the stellar post-main sequence. We
present our conclusions in Sect. 6.

2. TARGET DETAILS

AR Pup is a well studied post-AGB binary system
(Pollard et al. 1996; Kiss & B´odi 2017; Hillen et al.
2017). The study by Pollard et al. (1996) showed that
it is a RV Tauri1 variable of the photometric subclass
RVb.
It has a pulsation period of 76.66 days and a
RVb type modulation period of 1194 days (Kiss & B´odi
2017). The latter phenomenon is commonly attributed
to variable scattering and/or line of sight extinction
of the star light due to the binary’s orbital motion
(Waelkens et al. 1991, 1996) and thus constrains its or-
bital period (Manick et al., in prep.). The system’s dis-
tance is ∼1 to 6 kpc (van Leeuwen 2007; Gaia Collab-
oration 2018) and thus representative of nearby post-
AGB stars (de Ruyter et al. 2006). AR Pup has been
classifed as a G-type star based on the spectroscopi-
cally derived stellar parameters from Gonzalez et al.
(1997), who ﬁnd Teﬀ = 6000 K, log g = 1.5 (cgs system),
and a [Fe/H] = -1.0. A detailed chemical abundance
analysis has shown that AR Pup displays a photospheric
chemistry depleted of refractory elements and is consid-
ered to be a strongly depleted post-AGB star (Gezer
et al. 2015).

1 RV Tauri stars are luminous, variable stars (Type II Cepheids)
with alternating deep and shallow brightness minima. The RVb
subclass exhibits an additional long-term variation.

that the same observing setup (in particular exposure
time) as for the science target could be used. They also
have similar brightness in the R band and are close to
AR Pup in the sky, so that the AO performance on sci-
ence target and reference was as similar as possible. All
observations were carried out in pupil stabilized mode
to ensure that aberrations were as stable as possible.

For the ZIMPOL observations of both science target
and PSF reference star, a single nine point dither pat-
tern was executed. The number of exposures per dither
point was 16 for the science target, and 7 for the ref-
erence star. A detector integration time (DIT) of 4 s
was used for science target and reference star making
sure the source counts were within the linearity regime.
This resulted in a total of 144 exposures with a total
integration time of 576 s on the science target and 63
exposures with a total integration time of 252 s on the
PSF reference star. The observations were performed
simultaneously in the V (λ0 = 554.0 nm, ∆λ = 80.6 nm)
and N I (λ0 = 816.8 nm, ∆λ = 80.5 nm) ﬁlters using
the two detectors of ZIMPOL in classical imaging mode
(no polarization information obtained). A ﬁeld stop was
unintentionally inserted during the observations limiting
the ﬁeld of view (FoV) of our ZIMPOL observations to
1(cid:48)(cid:48).

The IRDIS data were obtained in dual band imaging
mode in the H2 (λc = 1588.8 nm, ∆λ = 53.1 nm) and
H3 (λc = 1667.1 nm, ∆λ = 55.6 nm) ﬁlters simultane-

ously. The observing strategy was analogous to that for
ZIMPOL. A 16 point dither pattern was used with three
and two exposures per point on the science target and
PSF reference star, respectively, and a DIT of 16 s. This
results in a total of 48 exposures with a total exposure
time of 786 s on the science target and 32 exposures with
a total exposure time of 512 s on the PSF reference star.
IFS observations in the Y to J band were carried
out in parallel with the IRDIS observations using the
integration time of 1024 s
IRDIFS mode. A total
(DIT=32 s, NDIT=16, NEXP=2) on the science tar-
get and 544 s (DIT=32 s, NDIT=17, NEXP=1) on the
reference star were used.

3.2. Data reduction

Data reduction was performed using the SPHERE

pipeline version 0.18.0 and our own Python scripts.

All ZIMPOL frames of both science and reference
observations were preprocessed using the pipeline to ex-
tract the informative component of the two detector
frames (cutting oﬀ prescan and overscan areas and re-
moving every second row which is masked on the detec-
tor) and to determine the overscan bias levels. In the
resulting frames, the overscan bias was subtracted and
each odd pixel was averaged with the following pixel in
a row, creating an eﬀective pixel scale of 7.2 mas. Flat
ﬁelding and bad pixel correction were not deemed neces-
sary given the image quality and the dither pattern per-

formed during the observations. The reference frames
were then centered on the source position (the location
of the peak brightness in our images of the target) with
an accuracy of 0.1 pix and stacked. The science frames
were centered, derotated, and stacked. For each science
frame, the stacked reference image was duplicated and
rotated by the same angle, so that stacking these rotated
PSFs results in the same rotational smearing of the re-
sulting reference PSF as the derotation of the science
frames.

Finally, the resulting science image was deconvolved
with the reference PSF using the Richardson-Lucy de-
convolution (Richardson 1972; Lucy 1974) which con-
verged within 100 iterations. The results of our ZIM-
POL data reduction are shown in Fig. 2.

Master background and ﬂat ﬁeld frames for the
IRDIS data were created using the pipeline and the
observatory provided calibration frames. These frames
were used to perform standard dark subtraction and
ﬂatﬁelding.
In the resulting frames, bad and hot pix-
els were corrected using a median ﬁltered map of each
frame and a sigma clipping approach. Finally, to further
reduce large scale detector cosmetics (stripes), we sub-
tracted from each column and row its respective median
in regions where no signiﬁcant source ﬂux was present.
The frames still contained two images of the source –
one for each ﬁlter. They were then cut to produce one
frame per ﬁlter and these frames were centered on the
source. From here the reduction was performed analo-
gous to the ZIMPOL reduction. Reference frames were
stacked, science frames were derotated and stacked, the
reference frames were duplicated, rotated the same way
as the science frames, and the results combined to pro-
duce a rotationally smeared reference PSF. The counts
in the H3 ﬁlter are by factors of ∼2 and ∼2.5 larger for
the calibrator and science target, respectively, compared
to the H2 ﬁlter. Thus, combining the two images did
not improve the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) compared to
using the H3 ﬁlter alone and we used only the H3 data
for the following image analysis.

The reference PSF was used to deconvolve the science
image using the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution which
converged within 50 iterations.
In addition, we per-
formed reference star diﬀerential imaging (RDI) on the
IRDIS data. This is diﬃcult, because the bright central
component of the science target is at least marginally
extended. As a consequence, our reference PSF ob-
tained by observing a point-like star is not an ideal rep-
resentation of the ﬂux distribution in our science image.
Scaling the PSF to the peak counts of the science tar-
get and subtracting it reveals the extended core of the
science target, but results in imperfect removal of the

core’s PSF from its surroundings. To reach a better
contrast further away from the peak emission, we scaled
the reference PSF to the same source counts as the sci-
ence target in a squared 40 × 40 pixel box (equivalent
to 490 × 490 mas, smaller than the AO control radius
of 800 mas). This results in a strong oversubtraction
of the core brightness, but a better removal of the core
emission from its surroundings. In both cases, the sub-
traction of the reference PSF leaves strong residuals due
to imperfect removal of the Airy rings, which are more
blurred for the science target due to its extended core.
The reduced IRDIS images are shown in Fig. 3.

For the IFS data, the pipeline was used to create mas-
ter background and ﬂat ﬁeld frames, a bad pixel map,
and to determine the wavelength calibration from the
observatory provided calibration frames as well as to
extract the spectral image cubes. We then reduced the
data for each spectral bin analogous to the IRDIS data.
The source structures in the resulting image are con-
sistent with those in the ZIMPOL and IRDIS images.
However, the S/N in these data is signiﬁcantly worse
than in the IRDIS data. It is dominated by residuals
from the data reduction, likely due to cross-talk, such
that combining multiple channels does not result in sig-
niﬁcant improvements. We thus do not further consider
these data in the present work.

3.3. Photometric calibration

We performed the photometric calibration of our im-
ages using the observed PSF reference stars as photo-
metric calibrators. Aperture photometry of the IRDIS
data was performed on each single frame. From the
scatter of the counts from those measurements we esti-
mated an uncertainty of 5%. We further add in quadra-
ture a conservative uncertainty of 10% since with one
calibrator observation we are not able to correct for var-
ious systematics related to air mass diﬀerences, vari-
able transmission (thin cirrus during the observations),
chromaticism, etc. We ﬁnd magnitudes of AR Pup of
6.4 ± 0.2 mag and 6.2 ± 0.2 mag in the H2 and H3 ﬁlters,
respectively, which is consistent within the uncertain-
ties with the 2MASS H magnitude of 6.824 ± 0.042 mag
(Skrutskie et al. 2006) and the object’s red near-infrared
color (J = 7.891 ± 0.029 mag, Ks = 5.285 ± 0.020 mag,
not considering variability2, Skrutskie et al. 2006). We
used our derived magnitude measurements to calibrate
the surface brightness of the extended emission.

2 2MASS observations in the J, H, and Ks band were obtained
simultaneously, so that colors derived from these measurements
are not aﬀected by temporal variability between measurements in
single bands.

Figure 3. IRDIS observations of AR Pup (top left), the PSF reference star HD 75363 (top right), and the RDI subtracted and
deconvolved images of AR Pup in the H3 ﬁlter (bottom row ). Both approaches for the RDI are shown, where for ‘peak RDI’ the
reference star image was scaled to the same peak counts as the AR Pup image and for ‘box RDI’ it was scaled to have the same
counts as the AR Pup image in a quadratic aperture centered on the peak.

Performing photometry on the ZIMPOL data is com-
plicated by the small FoV and the extended halo visible
in both the science and reference observations. This
cannot be distinguished from a halo around the source
expected from imperfect AO correction and thus has to
be considered instrumental. No such halo is visible in
the IRDIS images, which is also consistent with an AO
artifact, in which case its intensity would scale with the
inverse of the squared wavelength. We could assume
that the fraction of emission in the halo is the same
for the observations of science and reference target and
thus calibrate the total magnitude of our science tar-
get. However, to calibrate the surface brightness we
need the total source counts. We thus separated the
core and halo emission and approximated the halo with
a circular Gaussian. From this, we estimated the total
counts in the halo (inside and outside the FoV) and the
total source counts. These could then be used to cali-
brate the magnitude of AR Pup and the surface bright-
ness of the extended emission. We ﬁnd that about 45%
and 35% of the emission are in the halo in the V and I
bands, respectively, and 50% of the halo emission is out-
side the FoV in both bands. The counts from diﬀerent
frames suggest an uncertainty of about 10%. We conser-
vatively add in quadrature 25% uncertainty which is the
fraction of total ﬂux that we estimate to be outside the

FoV. The resulting brightness of AR Pup is estimated
to be 10.1 ± 0.3 mag and 9.0 ± 0.3 mag in the V and I
bands, respectively. This compares to a V magnitude of
9.6 at the time of the SPHERE observations estimated
from our variability monitoring analysis (Sect. 5.2). The
∼ 2σ diﬀerence is on the high end of what can be ex-
pected by random measurement errors and the fainter
ZIMPOL measurement may suggest that we underesti-
mate the emission in the extended halo. This illustrates
the diﬃculties of performing accurate absolute photom-
etry on AO data, in particular with a very small ﬁeld of
view.

4. IMAGING RESULTS

AR Pup’s disk is only the second bona-ﬁde post-AGB
binary disk that has successfully been imaged in the
visible and near-infrared. Thus the disk geometry and
the system’s spatial features inferred from our images
provide important insights; not only into the AR Pup
system, but also the whole class of objects.

4.1. General morphology

The reduced images from our observations of AR Pup
and the reference stars are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for
ZIMPOL and IRDIS, respectively. The stacked ZIM-

The same elongation can be surmised in the IRDIS data.
Deconvolution of the ZIMPOL images reveals a clear
‘double bowl’ structure separated by a dark band. This
is similar to the appearance of edge-on protoplanetary
disks. We thus interpret the dark band as the optically
thick disk mid-plane and the two ‘bowls’ as the two disk
surfaces scattering the star light. In the V and I bands
we see no indication of direct stellar light reaching us
through the disk (no central point source is visible). In
H band the lower angular resolution prevents us from
drawing a ﬁrm conclusion, but the elongated core of the
emission in Fig. 3 suggests that transmitted star light
only contributes a small fraction to the total brightness.
Ancillary optical long baseline interferometric data from
the Precision Integrated Optics Near-Infrared ExpeRi-
ment (PIONIER) at the Very Large Telescope Interfer-
ometer (VLTI) show that the contribution of direct stel-
lar light can be at most 10% of the total source bright-
ness in the H band (Appendix B).

The South-Eastern disk surface is brighter than the
North-Western one. This suggests that the South-
Eastern surface is oriented toward us, so that the star
light scattered on this surface reaches us directly. The
light scattered on the North-Eastern disk surface is
partly blocked by the disk following this interpretation.
The curvature of the disk mid-plane also supports this
view. The same structures are visible in the IRDIS data
after deconvolution or PSF subtraction, albeit less clear
due to the lower angular resolution and stronger resid-
uals from the post-processing. The described features
are the clearest in the deconvolved I band image de-
spite the nominally lower resolution compared to the
V band, which we attribute to a better AO correction
at longer wavelengths. This is supported by the images
of the reference star, where Airy rings are marginally
visible in the I band, but not in the V band. The dark
disk mid-plane has a radius of ∼50 mas, while bright
structures extend up to 300 mas from the disk center
in the deconvolved ZIMPOL images. The size in our
IRDIS images is somewhat smaller, most likely because
the higher noise and residuals from PSF subtraction or
deconvolution begin to dominate at smaller separations
than in the ZIMPOL images. The extended halo in the
ZIMPOL images has to be attributed to imperfect AO
correction as discussed in Sect. 3.3.

4.2. Disk orientation

We estimate the disk inclination and position angle
from the deconvolved V band image which provides
the highest angular resolution. To compensate approx-
imately for the geometric dilution of the star light be-
fore it is scattered by a dust grain at a given distance

nation. The counts in the deconvolved V band image have
been multiplied by the squared projected separation from
the peak location to approximately correct for the geometric
dilution of star light before being scattered by a dust grain.

tion angle and inclination, while the dashed lines and ellipse

form the star, we multiply the counts in the images by
the square of the projected separation from the peak
location of the emission (the approximate center of the
source). This further highlights the disk mid-plane. The
result is shown in Fig. 4. We then qualitatively ﬁt el-
lipses to the mid-plane to assess the plausible ranges for
the inclination and position angle of the disk. We esti-
mate a disk inclination of 75+10
−15 deg from face-on and a
position angle of the major axis of 45 ± 10 deg east of
north. A more formal analysis requires detailed radia-
tive transfer modeling due to the complex interplay of
disk orientation, scale hight, ﬂaring, optical depth, and
scattering phase function of the dust, which is beyond
the scope of this paper.

4.3. Disk substructure

In addition to the global features of the disk image dis-
cussed in the previous sections, there are a number of
arc-like substructures visible in both deconvolved ZIM-
POL images and in part in the non-deconvolved ZIM-
POL and deconvolved and PSF subtracted IRDIS im-
ages. We highlight the structures visible in the disk in
Fig. 5. To further illustrate the discussed features, we
show in Fig. 6 azimuthal proﬁles of the images in the

two ZIMPOL ﬁlters at a separation of 175 mas (25 pix-
els) from the location of the peak brightness. The dark
mid-plane is marked as feature A. The South-Eastern
bowl (feature B) has a sharp, bright, arc-like contour
which could be caused by a combination of geometric
and optical eﬀects (viewing angle along the surface of
the disk oriented toward Earth, forward scattering of
the light on large dust grains compared to the observ-
ing wavelength). The brightest part of the arc shows a
strong asymmetry and seems more extended toward the
East in both ZIMPOL images. This could be explained
by actual disk asymmetry or by an illumination eﬀect
due to the oﬀset of the bright post-AGB star from the
disk center on the binary orbit (see Sect 5.2.2 for a more
detailed discussion). Toward the South, the arc extends
into a long, fainter arm in the ZIMPOL V band and
IRDIS images. In the ZIMPOL I band image the faint
arc seems similarly extended toward the South. How-
ever, the arc appears fainter in the I band, so that it
partly blends with the rest of the disk emission. This

explains why the Southern peak B in Fig. 6 is only vis-
ible in the V band proﬁle, not the I band.

The North-Western bowl shows multiple, arc-like sub-
structures in the ZIMPOL images (features C). These
structures also have tentative counterparts in the de-
convolved IRDIS image, although they cannot be well
distinguished from deconvolution residuals. They are
weak modulations of the surface brightness and are not
obvious in the non-deconvolved images. Their locations
seem anti-correlated with the directions of two PSF fea-
tures best seen in the I band reference star image (beams
in both directions of the PSF peak at position angles of
∼120 deg and ∼160 deg East of North).
It is possible
that these features were not entirely stable during the
observations of science target and reference star. This
could have been overcompensated for during the decon-
volution process, resulting in dark artifacts at the loca-
tion of the PSF features, thus causing apparently bright
features at other locations. However, the PSF features
are symmetric around the core of the PSF. The fact that

10

Ertel et al.

disk material close to the star would suggest a shadowing
eﬀect. An outﬂow from the binary is expected to cause
a modulation of the features on the binary orbital time
scale.

5. DISCUSSION

5.1. Comparison to other disks around evolved stars

imaged in scattered light

The Red Rectangle is indubitably the case most sim-
ilar to AR Pup of a disk imaged around an evolved star
(Osterbart et al. 1997; Cohen et al. 2004). The disk
around the Red Rectangle’s post-AGB RVb binary cen-
tral star (Waelkens et al. 1996) could be imaged with
the Hubble Space Telescope due to its larger angular
size of ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48). It can be explained by a closer distance
(∼ 500 pc, van Leeuwen 2007), a larger physical disk
size, or a combination of both. This disk shows a sim-
ilar over-all shape with a double-bowl structure and a
dark mid-plane, but the two bowls show a weaker bright-
ness asymmetry, suggesting that the disk is seen closer
to edge-on. The primary is of spectral type B9 suggest-
ing that it is more evolved than AR Pup. The system
shows extended red emission which we would be unable
to detect in our data of AR Pup due to our small ﬁeld
of view (ZIMPOL) and limited sensitivity to faint, ex-
tended emission (IRDIS). No Hubble images of AR Pup
are available.

The disks around L2 Pup (Kervella et al. 2015) and
BP Psc (Zuckerman et al. 2008; de Boer et al. 2017)
are other potentially similar systems, albeit less clear:
L2 Pup has been characterized as a nearby AGB star
(d = 64 pc, van Leeuwen 2007) with a planetary mass
companion (Kervella et al. 2016; Homan et al. 2017) and
its disk is more compact with a size of ∼25 AU. The dis-
tance of BP Psc has recently been measured by Gaia
to be ∼350 pc (Gaia Collaboration 2018), conﬁrming
its nature as a ﬁrst ascent giant star (Zuckerman et al.
2008). The disk has a diameter of ∼35 AU (∼100 mas
at ∼350 pc), similar to that of L2 Pup. Neither L2 Pup
nor BP Psc are known to show long-term variability that
could be attributed to binary orbital motion.

If the planetary mass companion of L2 Pup was re-
sponsible for the formation of the disk, it cannot have
delivered as much angular momentum as the stellar mass
companion of AR Pup. This would explain the smaller
disk around L2 Pup and the fact that the star is still
characterized as an AGB star, i.e., the interaction with
the companion that created the disk did not terminate
the star’s AGB phase. The disk size and evolutionary
state of BP Psc as a ﬁrst ascent giant star (Zuckerman
et al. 2008) suggest that for this star, too, a companion

POL images at a separation of 175 mas (25 pixels) from the
location of the peak brightness (marked by the dotted cir-
cles in Fig. 5). The letters A, B, and C mark the locations of
the disk features discussed in Sect. 4.3 and shown in Fig. 5.
Uncertainties on the proﬁles are dominated by systematics

details).

the supposed disk features are only visible on one side
makes this scenario unlikely.

Understanding the origin of these arc-like features in
the North-Western side of the disk can give important
insights into the disk architecture, the system’s evolu-
tion, and binary-disk interaction. Kervella et al. (2015)
observed similar features in their images of the L2 Pup
disk (dubbed plumes in their paper). They suggested
the features originate in an outﬂow of material from the
binary star (wind or jet, as observed, e.g., by Bollen
et al. 2017 in the BD+46 442 system). An outﬂow in the
form of a disk wind as has been observed by Bujarra-
bal et al. (2018) for IRAS 08544-4431 would be another
possible explanation. If the features are indeed caused
by outﬂows, they could trace the processes producing
the bipolar morphologies observed in more evolved pro-
toplanetary nebulae and planetary nebulae.

Similar scattered light features have been observed
in young protoplanetary disks (Casassus et al. 2012;
Stolker et al. 2016; Benisty et al. 2017). These data re-
veal both spirals in the outer disk and structures in the
inner disk regions casting shadows onto the outer disk.
Price et al. (2018) modeled the binary-disk interaction
for the circumbinary disk HD 142527 and were able to
reproduce all observed features. These studies can in-
form similar studies of the features seen in the AR Pup
and L2 Pup images.

Monitoring the time evolution of the features can help
establishing their nature (Debes et al. 2017): A slow
evolution on the orbital time scale of material in the
outer disk would suggest actual structures in the outer
disk. Faster evolution on the orbital time scale of the

of planetary mass – rather than stellar mass – may be
responsible for the disk formation.

Given their small angular sizes compared to the an-
gular resolution of the instrument with which they were
imaged, it is no surprise that all four disks are seen close
to edge-on, at least partly obscuring their host stars.
Imaging disks oriented closer to face-on requires more
sophisticated high contrast techniques to reveal circum-
stellar disks of similar size, such as polarimetric diﬀer-
ential imaging. Such observations of post-AGB disks
have the potential to provide more insight into the disk
properties as they better allow us to image radial and
azimuthal brightness variations of the disk surface more
directly.

5.2. Connection to other observables of the system

We have demonstrated that it is now possible with
the newest extreme AO systems to image disks around
post-AGB binaries. This is, however, typically still only
possible for systems within a few kpc – depending on
linear disk size. Furthermore, AR Pup is particularly
well suited for this due to its edge-on disk masking the
bright stellar light, thus reducing the required image
contrast. Spatially resolved imaging of a few benchmark
systems such as AR Pup and connecting other observ-
ables of these systems to the properties of the disks is
vital to our understanding of systems that cannot be
resolved. Here we brieﬂy discuss AR Pup’s SED and
photometric variability in the light of our SPHERE im-
ages. A more comprehensive analysis will be enabled by
imaging a sample of post-AGB binary disks.

5.2.1. Spectral Energy Distribution

Hillen et al. (2017) found from their study of AR Pup’s
SED that the total infrared luminosity is higher than
that derived from the dereddened optical ﬂuxes. They
suggest that the disk of AR Pup must be seen close to
edge-on, so that most direct star light is blocked. We
conﬁrm this conclusion and expand on it with our re-
solved images of the system, showing that the light seen
at visible wavelengths stems entirely from star light scat-
tered in our direction by the dust on the disk surface.
The derived value of E(B − V ) has thus to be under-
stood as the result of a combination of eﬀects (Scicluna
& Siebenmorgen 2015): The light is altered by scatter-
ing events in the disk and aﬀected by circumstellar and
interstellar extinction on its indirect path from the star
toward us. The measured E(B − V ), however, heavily
underestimates the circumstellar extinction on the direct
line of sight from the star. Thus, the unreddened stellar
model in Fig. 1 heavily underestimates the total stel-
lar emission, so that it cannot be used to determine the

zontal, dotted line indicates the approximate mean magni-
tude of V = 9.5. The time of the SPHERE observations is
highlighted by the vertical, dashed line.

stellar luminosity or the star’s distance if the luminosity
is estimated or derived independently.

At near-infrared and longer wavelengths we start see-
ing the thermal emission of the disk. The onset of
this emission around the H band (Appendix B) indi-
cates that the hottest material has a temperature of
∼1200 K. The bulk emission peaks around 10 µm, in-
dicating a temperature around ∼550 K for the majority
of the dust. Detailed radiative transfer modeling of our
scattered light images and the SED can be used to de-
rive accurate disk parameters such as geometry and dust
properties.

5.2.2. RVb phenomenon

The fact that no direct stellar light is seen in the vis-
ible also has consequences for the interpretation of the
system’s observed RVb variability. To accurately deter-
mine the phase of the variability during our SPHERE
observations, we complement photometric time series
data from the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS, Po-
jmanski 2002) with own photometric monitoring ob-
servations between 2016 March 17 and 2016 June 9
(around the time of our SPHERE observations). Our
observations were performed at Mt. Kent Observa-
tory (near Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia) using
a PlaneWave CDK700 telescope equipped with an Alta
U16M Apogee camera. Data reduction and photometric
analysis were performed using the AstroImageJ software
package (Collins et al. 2017). We analyze the ASAS and

12

Ertel et al.

Mt. Kent data following Manick et al. (2017) and re-
cover the 76.66 days pulsation period and the 1194 days
RVb period found by Kiss & B´odi (2017) within the
uncertainties. We ﬁnd that the brightness of AR Pup
was increasing and close to its average value during our
SPHERE observations from both the pulsation variabil-
ity (∼5 days past minimum) and the long-term vari-
ability (∼300 days past minimum). This is illustrated
in Fig. 7.
Imaging the system at diﬀerent phases of
its variability will allow us to connect the photometric
variation, variations in the disk features, and the orbital
phase of the binary.

The origin of the long-term variability of RVb stars
has been attributed to either variable extinction or vari-
able scattering of star light by a circumbinary disk. For
example, Waelkens et al. (1991) concluded for HR 4049
based on the color dependence of the variability that it
likely stems from variable extinction. For the Red Rect-
angle, Waelkens et al. (1996) concluded that it must
stem from variable scattering because they don’t see any
color variation and the star is completely obscured by
the edge-on disk. Kiss & B´odi (2017) analyzed the am-
plitude variations of the short period variability of RVb
stars over the long period and conclude that they are
consistent with variable obscuration by the disk.

For AR Pup, we show that the star is fully obscured
by the disk, similar to the Red Rectangle. The star
was close to its mean brightness in both the long-term
and short-term variability cycles, so we cannot simply
see the moment of maximum obscuration over the cycle
of variable extinction. Instead, the variability must be
caused by variable scattering on the disk surface, similar
to the Red Rectangle. We ﬁnd the disk of AR Pup to
be slightly inclined away from edge-on and we see struc-
tures in the disk that may be attributed to illumination
eﬀects. We thus propose that variable disk illumination
over the binary’s orbital period is an alternative sce-
nario (although the two are not mutually exclusive) to
the variable scattering angle as the main source of the
brightness variations proposed by Waelkens et al. (1996)
for the Red Rectangle.

We illustrate in Fig. 8 how variable illumination of the
disk by the post-AGB star on its orbit can readily ex-
plain both the brightness variation and the asymmetric
brightness of the disk in our images. We start with a
disk that has a vertically thin inner edge. The side of the
disk closer to the bright post-AGB star on its orbit will
be brighter than the other side. When the star is on the
far side of its orbit, the far, visible side of the disk will
be brighter, while the near side of the disk will be fainter
(b). The system will thus be in a bright phase. As the
post-AGB star moves to the near side on its orbit, the

Figure 8. Illustration of the disk illumination eﬀect produc-
ing the RVb phenomenon in the AR Pup disk. A disk with
a vertically thin inner edge is shown (a) and its appearance
when viewed from various orientations is illustrated: (b) ap-
pearance if the post-AGB star is on the far side of its orbit,
(c) appearance if the post-AGB star is on the near side, and
(d) appearance if the post-AGB star is on the right. A disk
with an inﬂated inner edge is also shown (e), but the binary
phase is inverted so that the appearance of the disk in panels
(b), (c), and (d) is the same.

brightness of the system decreases, as visible side of the
disk becomes fainter (c). During our SPHERE observa-
tions, the star was approximately half way between the
near and far sides on its orbit, in which case the disk
would show a brightness asymmetry due to the way it is
illuminated (d). An orbital period of 1194 days implies
an orbital semi-major axis of (cid:38) 1 AU. If the inner edge
of the disk is plausibly at 5 AU, then the star would be
separated by (cid:38) 4 AU from one side and (cid:38) 6 AU from
the other side of the disk, causing a diﬀerence in illu-
mination by a factor (cid:38) 2.25. This is large enough to
explain the long-term variability of the system. Alter-
natively, the inner rim of the disk may be inﬂated due
to the heating from the star (e). This way, it would cast
a shadow onto the side of the outer disk close to the
post-AGB star. This side would then be fainter having
the opposite eﬀect compared to the scenario with a ver-
tically thin disk edge. The eﬀect may be enhanced by
the variable heating of the inner disk edge by the star on
its orbit with a larger scale height close to the post-AGB
star (Kluska et al. 2018). Disk structures created by the
gravitational interaction with the binary star may play
an additional role in the shadowing scenario.

Imaging of the AR Pup disk

These two scenarios demonstrate how resolved imag-
ing in combination with detailed knowledge of the binary
orbit can help us understand the structure of the disk
and its interaction with the binary star. Unfortunately,
for AR Pup a spectroscopic orbit is not available at the
moment. Obtaining such an orbit is one of the criti-
cal next steps in the study of this system. In addition,
multi-epoch imaging of the disk is important to monitor
the variation of the brightness asymmetry. Comparing
the time scale of this variability with the time scale of
the long-term variability is a critical test of the two sce-
narios described above.

(Andrews et al. 2013; Ansdell et al. 2016, 2017; Baren-
feld et al. 2016).

Several other studies have suggested a variety of av-
enues for second generation planet formation beyond a
star’s main sequence life time, suggesting this might not
be an uncommon process. The claimed3 discoveries of
planetary systems orbiting post-common envelope bi-
nary stars (e.g., Lee et al. 2009; Almeida et al. 2013;
Pulley et al. 2018) are best explained by such a scenario
(Mustill et al. 2013). The planets detected orbiting pul-
sars are another such example (Wolszczan & Frail 1992;
Wang et al. 2006). Recently, van Lieshout et al. (2018)
proposed a scenario how even Earth mass, rocky planets
could form in the habitable zones around white dwarfs.

5.3. An extreme laboratory for circumstellar disk

evolution

6. CONCLUSIONS

Several studies have now established the similari-
ties between post-AGB binary disks and protoplanetary
disks (de Ruyter et al. 2005; Gielen et al. 2011; Hillen
et al. 2014, 2015, 2017, Scicluna et al., in prep.). Our
results on AR Pup add to this picture by showing the
similar morphology and scale of this disk from high ﬁ-
delity images. In particular the presence of highly pro-
cessed grains up to millimeter size found by these works
may come as a surprise given the short disk life times
(∼104 years; Bujarrabal et al. 2018) and the fast evolu-
tion of their host stars (102 to 104 years, Miller Berto-
lami 2016; 103 to 104 years, Sahai et al. 2007; Gesicki
et al. 2010). Only recently, Harsono et al. (2018) were
able to infer the presence of millimeter sized dust grains
in the 105 year young disk around the protostar TMC1A,
while most protoplanetary disks are only observed at an
age of (cid:38) 106 years (e.g., Hartmann et al. 1998). Post-
AGB binary disks are thus interesting extreme labora-
tories to study circumstellar disk evolution and to con-
strain the time scales of dust grain growth, which is a
critical step in the planet formation process.

Due to their short life time, it remains questionable
if post-AGB binary disks could actually form planets.
However, large inner cavities such as the ones often at-
tributed to the presence of planets in transition disks (al-
though there may be other formation scenarios, Alexan-
der et al. 2014; Turner et al. 2014) have been found
in both the disks around the post-AGB binary AC Her
(Hillen et al. 2015) and the Class I protostar WL 17 (age
of a few 105 years) (Sheehan & Eisner 2017). In partic-
ular, the presence of a few large bodies such as left-over
planetesimals from the main sequence might act as a
catalyst in post-AGB binary disks (Birnstiel et al. 2012;
Garaud et al. 2013; Bitsch et al. 2015; Birnstiel et al.
2016). The dust masses estimated by de Ruyter et al.
(2005) seem consistent with those of protoplanetry disks

We have presented the ﬁrst resolved images of the cir-
cumbinary disk around the post-AGB star AR Pup. Us-
ing VLT/SPHERE observations in the visible and image
deconvolution with an observed reference star, as well as
reference star diﬀerential imaging, we were able to reveal
circumstellar emission in the V , I, and H bands. The
disk is optically thick in all our images and seen close to
edge-on. The dark disk mid-plane has a radius of about
50 mas and extended emission is detected out to a sep-
aration of about 300 mas from the source center. We
estimate an inclination of 75+10
−15 deg from face-on and a
position angle of the disk major axis of 45 ± 10 deg East
of North.

Several arc-like features are identiﬁed in the visible
images. We discussed various scenarios to explain these
features, including a disk wind, outﬂows or jets from the
central binary due to stellar wind or accretion, and shad-
ows cast onto the outer disk by disk structures closer in
due to binary-disk interactions. Resolved images at var-
ious phases of the binary orbit can potentially allow us
to distinguish between these scenarios.

There is no indication of direct stellar light in our
visible images and likely neither in the H band image.
We thus conclude that the long-term RVb photomet-
ric variability of the system must be caused by variable
scattering, not extinction, of star light over the binary
orbit. We propose a scenario of variable disk illumina-
tion in addition to previously discussed variations of the
scattering angle to explain this variability.

Finally, we highlight the value of post-AGB binary
disks as extreme laboratories to study circumstellar disk

3 A number of these candidates have been shown to be dynam-
ically unstable (e.g., Horner et al. 2011; Wittenmyer et al. 2013;
Pulley et al. 2018), which potentially casts doubt on the existence
of those claimed planets.

evolution. The high degree of dust processing observed
in these disks despite their short life times of < 105 years
strongly constrains the time scales at which dust pro-
cessing in disks can happen. If a connection to proto-
planetary disks can be made, this constrains the swift-
ness of the early stages of the planet formation pro-
cess. Along these lines, we argue that second generation
planet formation beyond a star’s main sequence life time
might not be uncommon.

Figure 9. PIONIER squared-visibility measurements of AR Pup in H band at a projected changing from 8.9 m to 9.1 m over
the ten minute sequence of exposures. Overplotted are a Gaussian source brightness distribution with FWHM = 25 mas and a
model consisting of a Gaussian (FWHM = 29 mas) plus a point source contributing 10% to the total source ﬂux.

B. PIONIER OBSERVATIONS

PIONIER (Le Bouquin et al. 2011) observations of AR Pup were carried out on 2015 Feb 24 (Project 094.D-0865,
PI: Hillen) using the compact array conﬁguration of the Auxiliary Telescopes of the VLTI (interferometric baselines
between 11.3 m and 34.3 m). Fringes could only be detected at the shortest baseline (projected baseline changing from
8.9 m to 9.1 m over the ten minute sequence of exposures). Five sequences of 100 scans each were recorded in six
spectral channels across the H band, resulting in 5 × 6 = 30 squared-visibility (V 2) measurements. HD 67556 was
observed after AR Pup as a calibration star in the same instrument setup. Data were reduced using version 3.30 of
the PIONIER pipeline. The squared-visibility measurements are shown in Fig. 9.

The bright central star of AR Pup is expected to be unresolved at short baselines (diameter ¡1 mas) and the contri-
bution of the faint companion is negligible, so that the stellar V 2 is expected to be one. The fact that fringes could
only be detected at the shortest baseline and the low visibility suggest that the source is extended. We show in Fig. 9
that a Gaussian source brightness distribution with a full width at half maximum (FWHM ) of 25 mas reproduces the
data well.

In order to put an upper limit on the amount of direct star light contributing to the total source emission in H band,
we add to the Gaussian brightness distribution an unresolved point source (the star) following, e.g., di Folco et al.
(2007). No satisfactory ﬁt with a substantial amount of direct star light could be achieved. We show in Fig. 9 a
model with a 10% point source and an FWHM of the Gaussian component of 29 mas, which produces a mediocre
ﬁt to the data. We thus put a conservative upper limit of 10% on the contribution of direct star light to the total
source emission. The fact that no fringes were detected at longer baselines also puts an upper limit of ∼ 10% on the
contribution of any point source to the total emission assuming the disk is fully resolved at these baselines and given
that a squared visibility of 1% can be detected by PIONIER.

Our measurements indicate that the contribution of direct star light to the total brightness of AR Pup in the
H band must be small. The strong brightness increase of AR Pup from the J band to the H band (Fig. 1) must thus
be dominated by the onset of hot thermal disk emission rather than the disk becoming optically thin and transmitting
direct star light.
