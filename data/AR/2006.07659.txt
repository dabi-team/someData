ABSTRACT

The evolution of magnetic helicity has a close relationship with solar eruptions and is of interest as a predictive diagnostic. In this
case study, we analyse the evolution of the normalised emergence, shearing and total magnetic helicity components in the case
of three ﬂaring and three non-ﬂaring active regions (ARs) using SHARPs (Spaceweather Helioseismic Magnetic Imager Active
Region Patches) vector magnetic ﬁeld data. The evolution of the three magnetic helicity components is analysed with wavelet
transforms, revealing signiﬁcant common periodicities of the normalised emergence, shearing and total helicity ﬂuxes before
ﬂares in the ﬂaring ARs. The three non-ﬂaring ARs do not show such common periodic behaviour. This case study suggests
that the presence of signiﬁcant periodicities in the power spectrum of magnetic helicity components could serve as a valuable
precursor for ﬂares.

1. INTRODUCTION
Space weather refers to the short-term interaction of diﬀer-
ent manifestations of solar activity with geospace that occurs
through a complex series of dynamic events. These inter-
actions can result in hazardous conditions for the function-
ing of many vital socioeconomic infrastructures, both ter-
restrial (e.g., long-distance oil/gas pipelines, electric power
grids, aviation-control, HF radio communication) and space-
based (e.g., communication satellites, global positioning sys-
tems, ISS), leading to a reduced or total lost capacity (East-
wood et al. 2017, and references therein). Advancements of
solar eruption forecasting capabilities through the identiﬁca-
tion of observable precursors at the Sun is crucial (see e.g.
Barnes et al. 2016; Leka et al. 2019, and references therein).
This forecasting is challenging, in particular understanding
the physical processes that underpin solar eruptions (see e.g.
Florios et al. 2018; Campi et al. 2019; Kors´os et al. 2019;
Wang et al. 2019).

Flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originate mostly
from magnetically complex, highly twisted and sheared ele-
ments of a δ-type active region (AR) (e.g. Toriumi & Wang
2019; Georgoulis et al. 2019, and references therein). The
evolution of the magnetic helicity (Elsasser 1956) is likely
to be a key physical process that precedes ﬂare and/or CME
events, and measurements of helicity derived from photo-
spheric magnetic ﬁeld data can provide insight into the un-

derlying mechanism(s) of these events. Many observational
studies have found a relationship between the temporal evo-
lution of helicity ﬂux and ﬂares/CMEs.

Moon et al. (2002a,b) found that a signiﬁcant amount of
helicity is injected before large ﬂare events. Smyrli et al.
(2010) investigated the helicity ﬂux in a case study of 10 ARs
and reported a sudden change in the helicity ﬂux was present
during six ﬂares. Park et al. (2008, 2012) discovered that the
helicity ﬂux slowly increases and then remains constant just
before ﬂares. Park et al. also reported that the injected he-
licity ﬂux changed its sign before some very impulsive ﬂare
and CMEs. Tziotziou et al. (2013) studied the dynamic evo-
lution of AR 11158 before ﬂares and CMEs, and found that
eruption-related decreases, and subsequent free-energy and
helicity budgets, were consistent with the observed eruption
magnitude. Other works addressed also that the helicity ﬂux
reversed sign around at the start of a ﬂare (Vemareddy et al.
2012; Wang et al. 2014; Gao 2018), caused by the interac-
tion between the associated magnetic ﬂux tubes with oppo-
site signs of helicity (Linton et al. 2001; Kusano et al. 2004;
Liu et al. 2007; Chandra et al. 2010; Romano et al. 2011;
Romano & Zuccarello 2011).
It is suggested that a CME
can also remove helicity from its source, leading to a lower
total AR potential magnetic energy (D´emoulin et al. 2002;
Smyrli et al. 2010). On the other hand, based on numerical
data, Pariat et al. (2017) claimed that magnetic energies and
the total relative helicity are not eﬀective diagnostics for ﬂare

 
 
 
 
 
 
prediction, but the decomposition of the relative magnetic he-
licity introduced by Berger (2003), in the current-carrying
component and its counterpart, may be useful. Based on so-
lar magnetic ﬁeld observations, Thalmann et al. (2019) gave
similar conclusions to Pariat et al. (2017). They reported that
the ratio of current-carrying to total helicity is capable of in-
dicating an eruptive AR, but not the magnitude of an upcom-
ing eruption.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have
found a relationship between the oscillatory behaviour of the
evolution of magnetic helicity (or its various components)
and ﬂaring activities that may be related to such oscillations.
A recent theoretical study by Prior et al. (2020) reported that
the multi-resolution wavelet decomposition is useful to anal-
yse the spatial scales of helicity in magnetic ﬁelds in a man-
ner which is consistently additive. To investigate distinctive
behaviour patterns of helicity ﬂux in ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring
ARs as a case study to demonstrate the concept, we focus
here on the evolution of the magnetic helicity injection rate
through wavelet analyses during the observable disk passage
period of six ARs.

The work is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the
adopted tools for the helicity ﬂux calculations and the selec-
tion criteria of these six investigated ARs. In Section 3, we
describe the analysis, and present the results. Key ﬁndings
and conclusions, along with a suggestion of future work, are
given in Section 4.

2. MAGNETIC HELICITY FLUX CALCULATION

The magnetic helicity is a proxy for the 3D complexity of
a magnetic ﬁeld in a volume, thus, it is often interpreted as
a generalisation of more local properties such as magnetic
twist and shear. Taylor (1974) and Woltjer (1958) introduced
the concept of magnetic helicity as a well-conserved quan-
tity, even in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Berger &
Field (1984) proved that helicity is conserved in conductive
plasma, meaning that helicity variations with respect to time
are essentially restricted to helicity ﬂow through a surface S .
Berger & Field (1984) showed that magnetic helicity dissi-
pates very slowly during the course of magnetic reconnec-
tion.

To monitor the helicity ﬂux (i.e., the helicity injection rate)
through the photosphere over an AR, we use the following
equation:

introduced by Berger (1984). Ap is the vector potential of
the potential magnetic ﬁeld Bp. Bh and Bz denote the tan-
gential and normal components of the magnetic ﬁeld vector
with respect to the surface S, and v⊥h and v⊥z are the tangen-
tial and normal components of velocity. The ﬁrst term on the
right side arises from twisted magnetic ﬂux tubes emerging
from the solar interior into the corona (emergence term here-

after), while the second term is generated by the shearing and
braiding of the ﬁeld lines by tangential motions on the solar
surface (shearing term hereafter). Ap is determined by the
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld and the Coulomb gauge (Berger
1997; Berger & Ruzmaikin 2000).

For magnetic helicity calculation, a reliable and continu-
ous photospheric vector magnetograms are required in or-
der to determine the associated photospheric velocity ﬁelds.
Therefore, we use hmi.sharp cea 720s vector magnetic ﬁeld
measurements of the Spaceweather Helioseismic Magnetic
Imager Active Region Patches (SHARPs1), with a 12-min
cadence (Bobra et al. 2014). The photospheric plasma ve-
locity is calculated by applying the Diﬀerential Aﬃne Ve-
locity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM2) al-
gorithm (Schuck 2008). The window size used in the cal-
culations is 19 pixels, which was determined by examining
the non-parametric Spearman rank order correlation coeﬃ-
cients, Pearson correlation coeﬃcients and slopes between
∆h · (vzBh − vhBz) and δBz/δt (Schuck 2008). The vector po-
tential Ap is derived using MUDPACK (for details see e.g.
Adams 1993), a multigrid software for solving elliptic partial
diﬀerential equations.

In this case study, we analyse the magnetic helicity ﬂux
evolution of six ARs, namely NOAA ARs 11166, 11785,
11890, 12192, 12470 and 12645 (see Fig. 1), which were
selected to satisfy the following criteria:

• The selected ARs respect

the Hale-Nicholson law
(Hale & Nicholson 1925) of solar cycle 24. Some
works claim that AR that violatethe HaleNicholson
law are more ﬂare/CME productive (Elmhamdi et al.
2014, and references therein).

• The ARs have a prevalent bipolar conﬁguration.

• The ARs have δ-spot(s).

• The ARs have two distinct behaviours in terms of ﬂare
activity. ARs 11166, 11890 and 12192 were host of
intense M and X-class ﬂares, and are grouped as “ﬂar-
ing”. ARs 11785, 12470 and 12645 only produced B-
and C-class ﬂares and are grouped as “non-ﬂaring”.

• The AR is not a cradle of signiﬁcant/fast CME erup-
tions that have linear velocities larger than ∼1000
km/s. In this regard, ARs 11166 and 11890 produced
slow CMEs only, with 400-700 km/s linear speeds. AR
12192 was rich in terms of ﬂaring but not in terms of
CMEs.

• In each of the ﬂaring/non-ﬂaring groups, one-one AR
is characterised to be dominantly either in formation

Table 1 summarises the time interval of observations of the
six ARs. Each time interval is limited to a duration when the
corresponding AR is between −60◦ and +60◦ with respect
to the central meridian to avoid extreme magnetic ﬁeld pro-
jection eﬀects (Bobra et al. 2014). Table 1 includes also the
onset time and the associated GOES class of the ﬂares oc-
curred in each AR, based on the GOES solar ﬂare catalog3.
Furthermore, Table 1 gives information on the dominant evo-
lutionary phases of the ARs, and on how long their δ-spots
were observed.

3. DATA ANALYSIS

The emergence and shearing components of the magnetic
helicity of the six ARs are calculated using Equation (1). The
total magnetic helicity ﬂux for a given AR was generated by
summing the emergence and shearing components. The three
helicity injection rates for each AR were obtained by inte-
grating the helicity ﬂux over the entire area of the AR. The
three helicity ﬂux components are further normalised by their
respective largest absolute value in order to facilitate compar-
ison on similar scales. The normalised emergence, shearing
and total helicity ﬂuxes are shown in the top panels of Fig-
ures 2–3. In the upper panels of Figs. 2–3, the blue line is
the emergence term, the red line the magnetic helicity ﬂux

associated with shearing motions at the photosphere, and the
black line is the total magnetic ﬂux.

By inspecting the top panels of Figures 2–3a-c, we can see
that the normalised shearing and total helicity ﬂux compo-
nents show similar evolution trends in each of the six AR
cases, which suggests that the shearing motion plays a more
important role in the evolution of total helicity. The emer-
gence helicity ﬂux develops diﬀerently when compared to
the two other components, see e.g. in case of AR 11890 or
12470. Furthermore, we can also identify various quasi-
periodic patterns in the evolution of the three helicity com-
ponents, for both ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring AR cases. However,
to reveal a possible diacritical periodic signal(s) between the
two groups, we construct wavelet power spectra (WPS) using
a software developed by Torrence & Compo (1998), employ-
ing the default Morlet wavelet proﬁle. The associated global
power spectrum (GPS) is also calculated as the WPS aver-
aged over time for each case. This is similar to a Fourier
power spectrum. The signiﬁcance level of the WPS, at one σ
conﬁdence level, is estimated using a white noise model and
the standard deviation of the input signal. This signiﬁcance
is a function of the periodicity. Therefore, the ratio of the
WPS to the signiﬁcance level is useful to identify signiﬁcant
periodicities - we call this value the signiﬁcance ratio. In Fig-
ures 2–3a-c, the natural logarithm of this ratio is displayed,
therefore values of 0 or higher (or within the black contours)
are signiﬁcant.

In Figures 2–3a-c, the WPS and GPS of the emergence
(EM), shearing (SH) and total (Total) helicity ﬂuxes are
shown, after application of a high-pass ﬁlter. The original
data series is smoothed with a time scale of two-third of the

normalised emergence (EM, blue), shearing (SH, red), and total (Total, black) helicity ﬂuxes. The red vertical lines mark the onset time of ﬂares.
The 2nd-4th rows show the wavelet power spectrum (WPS) of the normalised emergence, shearing, and total helicity ﬂuxes, respectively. Rather
than plotting power directly, the colour bars visualize the logarithm of the ratio of the power to the expected power for Gaussian-distributed
white noise and signiﬁcance compared to noise. The x-axis of each WPS is the observation time, and the y-axis is the period, both in hours. On
the WPS plots, the black lines bound the cone-of-inﬂuence, i.e. the domain where edge eﬀects become important. The plots to the right of each
WPS are the corresponding global wavelet spectra (power averaged over time, similar to a Fourier power spectrum). The orange dashed lines
mark the one σ conﬁdence in global wavelet spectrum analyses.

full length of the time series, and the resulting smoothed se-
ries is subtracted from the original data series, thus damping
power at long periods. This is an important step because slow
changes that are not of immediate interest for this study may
aﬀect the calculation of signiﬁcance levels at shorter periods
(McAteer et al. 2002). In this study, a signiﬁcant period is
identiﬁed as (i) a signiﬁcance ratio larger than 1 (i.e. that is 0
on the ln scale) measured in σ, and (ii) the peak in the GPS is
above the conﬁdence level (shown as the dashed orange line
in the GPS plots).

Based on Figures 2a-c, in the case of three ﬂaring ARs,
there are common peak(s) of the EM, SH, and total helicity
ﬂux components in the WPS and GPS preceding the ﬂare
occurrences. In particular:

• AR 11166: In Fig. 2a, a powerful the 34-hr periodicity
is present in the GPS of the EM, SH, and total helic-
ity ﬂuxes about 5 days prior to the X1.5 ﬂare occur-
rence. The WPS shows that 34-hr periodicity persists
for a lifetime of ∼3 cycles in the EM time series and

declines after the ﬂare. However, this periodicity con-
tinues to play an important role for 5 cycles in the SH
and total helicity ﬂuxes. The EM shows a 20-hr short-
lived periodicity (2 cycles) near the start of the time
series. This feature is a result of the abrupt large neg-
ative value in EM that is not present in the data of SH
and in the total ﬂux components. It is interesting to
note that the 20-hr periodicity coincides with the large
variations (and even a change in sign) in the EM, and
could be related to the ﬁndings of Smyrli et al. (2010)
and/or Park et al. (2008, 2012) mentioned in the Intro-
duction.

• AR 12192: There are two common peaks in periodici-
ties in the three helicity ﬂux components, see Fig. 2b.
First, a ∼35-hr strong periodicity is observable before
the M8.6 and X1.6 ﬂares in the EM, SH, and total ﬂux
time series, as shown in both the WPS and GPS. Af-
ter the M8.6 and X1.6 ﬂares, a ∼10-hr periodicity also
becomes dominant next to the ∼35-hr prior to the re-

maining three X-class ﬂares. This ∼10-hr common pe-
riodicity is sporadically present in the EM and SH time
series. However, this peak appears only after the X1.6
ﬂare in the evolution of the total ﬂux data. The lifetime
of the ∼35-hr periodicity is longer than 5 cycles in the
case of the three helicity ﬂux components. Neverthe-
less, the ∼10-hr period is observed through 20 cycles in
the case of the EM, while this periodicity is continued
during 13/11 cycles in the SH/total data.

• AR 11890: Similar to AR 12192, we identify common
peaks at two distinct periodicities in the three helic-
ity components prior to the X-class ﬂares in Fig. 2c.
The ﬁrst peak period is ∼8-hr, which appears before
the X3.3 and the ﬁrst X1.1 ﬂare, respectively. This ∼8-
hr period decays after 10 cycles, just after the ﬁrst X1.1
event. In the case of the second X1.1 ﬂare, the ∼28-
hr periodicity peak becomes a common feature only
from ∼115 hrs in the WPS of the EM, SH and total
ﬂux components. The ∼28-hr peak appears earlier and
is observable throughout 5 cycles in the EM, compared
to a lifetime of only 3 cycles in the SH and total ﬂux
components.

Common signiﬁcant periodicities are absent in the helicity
ﬂux components of the three non-ﬂaring AR. Only the EM

ﬂux time series of ARs 12470 and 12645 show some peaks
in the WPS and GPS of Fig. 3. In the case of AR 12645,
there are periods of 5/23/37-hr over 18/6/5 cycles, respec-
tively. AR 12470 also shows ∼7/9/19/39-hr periods which
are observed through 23/18/9/4 cycles in the evolution of the
EM ﬂux, respectively. In the case of AR 11785, the SH and
the total has a 23-hr period with 3 cycles only.

From Figures 2–3 we conclude that shorter periods (5-10-
hr) mostly appear when an AR is in the fully developed phase
(e.g. ARs 12192 and 12470). At this stage, small amounts
of ﬂux appear or disappear but the total ﬂux of an AR does
not change dramatically. AR 11890 has shorter periods until
the magnetic ﬂuxes start to break apart and slowly dissipate.
In the case of AR 12645, the 5-hr period becomes signiﬁcant
as the AR reached its fully developed phase. It seems that
long-term periodicities are present during the entire lifetime
of an AR.

The WPS and GPS of the non-ﬂaring ARs reveal no evi-
dence for the 24- or 12-hr oscillations that are claimed to be
present in HMI data due to the orbital motion of the SDO
spacecraft. This eﬀect has been reported by Liu et al. (2012),
where the Zeeman splitting coupled with the Doppler eﬀect
due to the Sun’s rotation and the spacecraft motion causes
the spectral line to shift every 12 and 24 hours. Smirnova
et al. (2013b,a) found that the amplitude of these oscillations

increases rapidly when the ﬁeld strength exceeds 2000 G in
the magnetic ﬁelds of ARs. Kutsenko & Abramenko (2016)
further argued for the presence of these two artiﬁcial oscilla-
tions by studying wavelet transform of the solar mean mag-
netic ﬁeld measurements. If these oscillations were indeed
signiﬁcant in the helicity components presented in this work,
we would expect to see them in the WPS of all ARs, par-
ticularly in the non-ﬂaring regions where there are very few
periodicities of signiﬁcant power. If they are present, they are
weak, and below the threshold signiﬁcant levels.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Comparing the evolution of the helicity ﬂuxes between the
ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs is important, since it reﬂects
the dynamic evolution of an AR. The magnetic helicity is
uniquely related to the geometrical complexity of the under-
lying magnetic system, determined by the twist and writhe of
individual magnetic ﬁeld lines, as well as their mutual entan-
glement. Therefore, the helicity plays an important role in
solar activity phenomena, and, the magnetic-helicity-based
quantities may be eﬃcient for the purpose of ﬂare prediction
(see e.g. Pariat et al. 2017; Thalmann et al. 2019, and refer-
ences therein). It remains still a challenging task to ﬁnd an
improved characterisation of the evolution of helicity injec-
tion inside an AR, and employ this information as a practical
tool in the context of ﬂare prediction.

In this work, we determine the emergence, shearing, and
total helicity components of six ARs by using the DAVE4VM
algorithm (Schuck 2008). Three ARs produced intensive so-
lar ﬂare eruptions and another three ARs were host of smaller
B- and C-class ﬂares only. In the case of ﬂaring/non-ﬂaring
groups, one AR was selected to represent each of the three
morphology phases of formation, fully developed, and decay.
Following a wavelet analysis of the time series of normalised
helicity ﬂux components, we found the following:

1. Flaring ARs show common and rather powerful pe-
riodicities in the time series of the normalised emer-
gence, shearing and total helicity ﬂuxes. These com-
mon periodicities tend to appear before the occurrence
of the large ﬂares.

2. Non-ﬂaring ARs do not possess such clear common
periodicities present in the three magnetic helicity
components.

3. Shorter periods, e.g. between 5-10-hr, are observ-
able when an AR is in its fully developed evolutionary

phase.

4. Longer periods are present during an AR’s lifetime.
The identiﬁed longer periods are found to be compa-
rable with the results of Goldvarg et al. (2005). They
found a 48-hr periodicity of the energy release of ARs
in a larger statistical example.

The periodicity of EM and SH components of magnetic
helicity may reﬂect the evolution of ARs where the mag-
netic ﬂux emergence, the complexity evolution, and the sub-
sequent energy release, do not occur monotonically but by al-
ternating and periodic phases. Supporting Pariat et al. (2017)
and Thalmann et al. (2019), we can also conclude that the
three helicity ﬂux components are together capable to reveal
the threat of a ﬂaring AR, but not the magnitude of an up-
coming eruption. Our ﬁndings demand a similar analysis on
a much larger dataset to draw more ﬁrm conclusions about
the ﬂaring precursor capability and accuracy of helicity ﬂux.
