Abstract. A new electron beam-optical procedure is proposed for quasi-cw pumping of high-pressure 
large-volume He–Ar laser on 4p[1/2]1 – 4s[3/2]2  argon atom transition at the wavelength of 912.5 nm. 
It consists of creation and maintenance of a necessary density of 4s[3/2]2  metastable state in the gain 
medium  by  a  fast  electron  beam  and  subsequent  optically  pumping  of  the  upper  laser  level  via  the 
classical  three-level  scheme  using  a  laser  diode.  Absorption  probing  is  used  to  study  collisional 
quenching of Ar* metastable in electron-beam-excited high-pressure He–Ar mixtures with a low con-
tent  of  argon.  The  rate  constants  for  plasma-chemical  reactions  Ar*+He+Ar-Ar2*+He    (3.6  +- 
0.4)x10–33  cm6/s,  Ar+2He-HeAr*+He  (4.4  +-  0.9)x10–36  cm6/s  and  Ar*+He-Products+He    (2.4  +- 
0.3)x10–15 cm3/s are for the first time measured.

1. Introduction 

A high-pressure He–Ar gas laser at 4p[1/2]1 – 4s[3/2]2   ArI transition with lasing wavelength of 912.5 nm was for 
the  first  time  launched  more  than  forty  years  ago  [1].  This  laser  pumped  by  a  fast  high-voltage  subnanosecond 
electric discharge is a classical representative of lasers on "self-terminating transitions" and has a very low lasing 
efficiency. The low efficiency is due to the fact that there is no effective mechanism for depopulating the lower 
laser  level  in  such  lasers.  The  metastable  level  in  this  He–Ar  laser  is  depopulated  by  rather  slow  quenching  in 
collisions with gain medium atoms. A development of lasing at such a transition leads to populating the lower laser 
level quite rapidly and, consequently, to lasing termination. 

In papers [2–4], a high-pressure He–Ar laser with combined two-step pumping was put into practice. At the first 
stage, a sufficient density of 4s[3/2]2  metastable Ar states was produced by conduction electrons in high-current 
electric  discharge  plasma.  In  the  second  stage,  a  population  inversion  on  the  laser  transition  was  formed  in 
accordance  with  the  classical  three-level  scheme  due  to  optical  excitation  of  4p[5/2]3  higher-lying  level  and 
subsequent collisional quenching to the upper laser level 4p[1/2]1. Optical pumping was accomplished with a laser 
diode via allowed optical transition 4p[5/2]3 - 4s[3/2]2   with a large oscillator strength and the wavelength of 811.5 
nm that is relatively close to the laser wavelength. 
In [1–4], pumping of high-pressure gain medium by an electric discharge imposed fundamental limitations on the 
maximum  values of excited volume and pump pulse width. Indeed,  their increase over tens of cubic centimeters 
and tens of nanoseconds, respectively, lead to the development in rare gas mixtures of various, primarily ionization, 
instabilities because of particular structure of rare gas atomic levels (small energy gap between the lowest excited 
states and ionization potential), which results in rapid discharge contraction. To bring into action a quasi-cw opera-
tion with a large gain volume, we propose to create and maintain the necessary density of excited metastable atoms 
in the active medium during a required time by a fast electron beam (figure 1).

Previously  we  employed  a  similar  approach  to  develop  a  high-power  electro-ionization  (i.e.  e-beam  sustained 
discharge)  Ar–Xe  laser  on  5d–6p  XeI  transitions  [5,  6].  A  fast  electron  beam  was  used  to  ionize  gas  mixture 
producing sufficient density of metastable 6s states of xenon and, thus, forming a gain medium with new electrical 
properties.  Applying  an  electric  field  to  the  ionized  gain  medium  with  such  new  properties  made  it  possible  to 
efficiently pump 5d–6p laser transitions via a four-level excitation scheme not from the ground state, but from the 6s 
states already produced by the electron beam, which brought Ar–Xe lasers to a qualitatively new level setting them on 
a par with the most powerful of the known lasers [5–8]. In the present paper, we also propose to form a gain medium 
with new properties by means of fast electron beam, which makes it possible to perform a quasi-cw (in contrast to [2–
4]) optical pumping of ArI  4p[1/2]1 - 4s[3/2]2  transition through a three-level scheme of figure 1 from metastable 
4s[3/2]2 state. Implication of such a quasi-cw "electron beam-optical" procedure has to highly increase both geometric 
dimension of the gain medium and laser pulse width and, consequently, substantially elevate the laser output. 

To estimate an efficiency of the proposed scheme before carrying out a complicated experiment, it is necessary to 
know,  in  particular,  rate  constants  for  the  collisional  plasma-chemical  reactions  in  He–Ar  mixtures.  However, 
relevant literature data are currently practically absent. This study is the first step in this direction and deals with 
collisional quenching of the 4s[3/2]2 lower laser level in following reactions:

In our research He–Ar mixtures excited by a beam of fast electrons were experimentally studied. Measurements of 
the reaction rate constants were performed by the method of absorption probing based on the dependences of the 
decay rate of 4s[3/2]2 state on the total gas pressure and concentration ratio between the working and buffer gas. 
For this purpose, the absorption time behavior of a probing light pulse at the wavelength of 912.3 nm (figure 2) in 
the afterglow of gas mixture excited by a high-power beam of fast electrons was recorded.

2. Experiment 

Our  experiments  were  carried  out  with  a  cold-cathode  electron  gun  being  a  part  of  the  pulsed  laser  facility 
"Tandem" [17]. An electron beam of 5100 cm2 cross section with a peak current density up to 1.5 A/cm2, bell-
shaped current pulse with full width of ~2.5 μs and electron energy of ~250 keV was injected into the measuring 
chamber with an active volume of 55100 cm3 perpendicular to its optical axis. This 5-l measuring chamber was 
made  of  stainless steel.  Before  filling,  the  measuring  chamber  was  evacuated through  a  liquid nitrogen  trap  to a 
residual pressure of ~10–5 Torr. Gas leakage into the evacuated chamber and its walls outgassing does not exceed 
10–3 Torr/hour. Helium of grade  "A" (99.998 vol %) and argon of high-purity  grade  (99.9992%)  in gas mixtures

The  optical  scheme  of  our  measurements  is  shown  in  figure  3.  A  broadband  ISI-1  (1)  light  source  with  a  pulse 
width of ~30 μs (figure 4, curve B) served as a source of the probing signal. The light was collimated into a nearly 
parallel beam of probe radiation 5 cm in diameter. After passing through the e-beam-pumped gas mixture in cham-
ber  5  it  was  focused  onto  the  entrance  slit  of  high-aperture  monochromator  MDR-2  (8)  equipped  with  a  600 
grooves/mm diffraction grating. The radiation selected by the monochromator tuned to the needed wavelength was 
detected by photodetector 10 comprised of a high-speed PIN-photodiode BPW34 of Infineon Technologies AG and 
AD8055  broadband  operational  amplifier  from  Analog  Devices  housed  in  a  metal  case  with  double  shielding.  A 
fraction  of  the  radiation  reflected  from  plane-parallel  glass  plate  4  set  in  front  of  the  measuring  chamber  was 
directed,  bypassing  the  measuring  chamber,  onto  other  MDR-2  monochromator  9  and  photodetector  11.  To 
suppress a short-wave radiation going on the photodetectors in the second diffraction order, an optical filter KS-10 
(3 ) was set into the probing radiation beam. Signals from the photodetectors were monitored using a two-channel 
PC-based digital storage oscilloscope DSO-2010 of Link Instruments Inc.

absorption is due to fluorescence on the transition under study. 

In this case, time evolution of the state population under our study is an exponential function 

[Ar*](t) = N0 exp(–kdt) 

(5) 

with the decay rate of 

kd = k1[Ar][He] + k2[He]2 +k3[He]. 

(6) 
Here  k1  and  k2  are  the  rate  constants  for  excimerization  in  reactions  (1)  and  (2),  respectively,  and  k3  is  the  rate 
constant for two-body reaction (3).  

When  monochromatic  radiation  at  the  wavelength  of  912.3  nm  passes  the  e-beam  excited  medium,  the  linear 

absorption coefficient k should be proportional to the density of the absorbing 

state: 

k(t) ~ [Ar*](t). 

(7) 
In our experiments, the width of input and output slits of the monochromator was ~0.2 mm providing a satisfactory 
signal-to-noise ratio, and the width of the monochromator instrumental function was much broader than absorption 
profile width of the line under study in the gas pressure range of 1.75–4.0 atm. In this case, the Bouguer-Lambert-
Beer  law  does  not  generally  hold,  and  one  has  to  use  an  empirical,  or  so-called  modified  form  of  the  Bouguer-
Lambert-Beer law [18, 19] relating the measured transmission coefficient T to the absorption coefficient k as 

ln(1/T) = (kL).  

(8) 
Here L is the length of the e-beam-excited absorbing medium and  is dimensionless factor which depends on the 
ratio  between  the  widths  of  the  absorption  line  and  the  monochromator  instrumental  function.  Plotting  the 
experimental dependences

proved applicability of the modified Bouguer-Lambert-Beer law under our conditions and allowed us to measure 
the dimensionless factor γ, which happened to be γ = 0.5 in our experiments (for more details see [20]). 

It follows from (8), taking into account relation (7) and the time dependence [Ar*](t) expected in accordance with 
(5), that the trailing edge of the "absorption pulse" ln(1/T) should be strictly exponential: 

ln[1/T(t)] ~ exp(–γkd t). 

(10) 
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the expression (10) results in the following linear expression for the 
time evolution of the transmittance T in the e-beam afterglow:

pressure  of  2.5  atm  for  the 
  transition  wavelength  are  shown  in  figure  4.  Amplitudes  of  the 
signals going into (B) and out of (A) the excited active medium allows one to find the medium transmittance T at the 
wavelength selected by the monochromator at each instant of time. Time evolution of the absorption pulse ln(1/T) in 
the excited He–Ar mixture derived from the oscilloscope traces in figure 4 is shown in figure 5a. The time evolution 
of the double logarithm ln ln(1/T ) at trailing edge of the absorption pulse is shown in figure 5b. One can see that the 
plotted dependence has a convex-concave shape and cannot be reasonably approximated by linear function (11) (bold 
line A in figure 5b). 

Such  a  time  behavior  of  the  ln ln(1/T)  function  has  two  reasons.  Firstly,  as  in  [11,  12],  collisional  quenching  of 
Ar(4s) level under study is so slow that it is necessary to take into account an influence on its population of even 
weak recombination flow that continue to populate this level in the afterglow within certain time after termination 
of the e-beam pulse. In the experiment, such recombination flow manifests itself in appearance of certain convexity 
within the beginning part of the bold curve B in figure 5b.

(bold curve B), for the oscilloscope traces in figure 4. 

 atomic transition turned out to lie within a broad absorption band 
Secondly, the wavelength of 
of excimer states (see figure 6) whose decay rates are lower than quenching rates of the argon level under study. 
This leads to additional  absorption  of  the  probe  pulse  and appearance of a  slow  "tail"  (certain  concavity)  on  the 
bold curve B in figure 5b (see also [13]). 

To "extract" the sought-for exponential component in the absorption pulse trailing edge with kd set by the reactions (1)–
(3), it was proposed in [13] to numerically simulate the time dependences like that presented in figure 5b using the fol-
lowing approximation: 

ln ln(1/T) = ln(pex exp(–kex (t–t0)) + pd exp(–(γg (t–t0))2) exp(–γkd (t–t0))),

To find the decay rate kd from the measured ln ln(1/T) time dependence, it was simulated by using the procedure of 
least squares by varying  pex, pd, kex, g and kd parameters in accordance with the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm 
(LMA) [21, 22]). A set of experimental data for the mixtures He–Ar = 50:1, 75:1, 100:1 and 200:1 at gas pressures 
from p = 1.75 to 4.0 atm was numerically calculated with a step of 0.25 atm. 
In the coordinates of figure 5a the function (12) corresponds to the function 

ln(1/T) = pex exp(–kex (t–t0)) + pd exp(–(γg (t–t0))2) exp(–γkd (t–t0)), 

where the first, slowly-decaying term of the right-hand side of (13) 

pex exp(–kex (t–t0)) 

describes a broadband absorption (γ = 1) of the probe pulse by the excimer molecules, whereas the second term 

pd exp(–(γg (t–t0))2) exp(–γkd (t–t0))  

describes the studied exponential process of collisional quenching of 

metastable state 

exp(–γkd (t–t0))  

with "Gaussian pre-exponent" 
exp(–(γg (t–t0))2),  

(17) 
which  provides  a  correction  for  the  recombination  and  relaxation  processes  of  populating  this  state  
[11, 12]. Obtaining a true form of the Gaussian pre-exponent in analytical form is hardly possible because of the 
variety and complexity of the relevant reactions depending, in particular, on the time-varying temperature and den-
sity  of  the  secondary  electrons.  However,  in  practice,  the  above  description  gives  satisfactory  results  within  the 
transmittance  dynamic  range  T  =  0.1  −  0.9  (see  figure  4).  To  illustrate,  in  figure 7  for  each  He–Ar  mixture  the 
values of kd [He]–1, i.e., the quenching rate reduced to He buffer-gas concentration, are plotted as a function of this 
concentration. In accordance with linear dependence expected from (6)  

 = ( k1 + k2)[He] + k3  

(18) 

(here  = [Ar]/[He]) the experimental points with good accuracy lie on the straight lines originating from a common 
point on the ordinate axis, which proves adequacy of the  representation (12) and (13) and correctness of the de-
scribed procedure of experimental data processing.

Processing of the experimental dependences lnln[1/T(t)] within the above-described technique but using a simpler 
linear approximation (the bold line A in figure 5b, see also [14]) allowed us to estimate the reaction rate constants 
with  rather  limited  accuracy,  which  estimate  makes  it  possible  to  find  an  "upper  bound"  for  the  rate  constants 
(Table 1). 

The results obtained in the present study demonstrate that under our experimental conditions collisional quenching 

of  4s  states  of  the  Ar  atom  in  He–Ar  mixture  occurs  through  the  three-body  reaction  with  formation  of 
homonuclear  dimer  (1)  and  two-body  reaction  (3).  The  three-body  reaction  (2)  with  formation  of  HeAr* 
heteronuclear  dimer  hardly  contribute  to  collisional  quenching  of  Ar*.  This  may  be  related  to  the  fact  that 
heteronuclear dimer HeAr*, a product  of reaction (2), turns out to be unstable because of its low binding energy 
[23]  and  rapidly  decomposes  into  the  initial  components  in  the  reverse  collisional  reaction.  Thus,  the  measured 
effective rate constant for the formation of HeAr* dimer happens to be negligible. 

3. Conclusion 
A new approach to the development of high-power high-pressure quasi-cw He–Ar laser with a large volume of gain 

medium at 

 ArI transition with electron beam-optical pumping is proposed in this paper. It is 

proposed to create and maintain the necessary  density of excited metastable states 
 in the  gain medium 
using a fast electron beam and then to pump the upper laser level by a laser diode in accordance with the classical 
three-level scheme. The offered technique does not set a fundamental limitation on the excited volume dimensions 
and lasing pulse width.

Collisional  quenching  of  lower  laser  level
  in  He–Ar  mixtures  excited  by  a  beam  of  fast  electrons  was 
experimentally studied. The rate constants for plasma-chemical reactions (1)–(3) are measured for the first time by 

the  procedure  of  absorption  probing.  It  is  shown  that  the  main  channels  of  quenching 

  state  are  the 

  dimer  with  rate  constant  3.610–33  cm6/s  and  quenching  by 
processes  of  excimerization  with  formation  of 
buffer gas with rate constant 2.410–15 cm3/s, whereas the reaction with formation of the heteronuclear dimer plays 
virtually no role. The measurements demonstrated that the rate of collisional quenching of 
 state is low 
being considerably inferior to the rates of similar processes in the mixtures of other rare gases measured earlier in 
[10–16]. This circumstance does indicate that production and maintenance of the necessary amount of argon atoms 
 state is feasible at very moderate current densities of pumping electron beam readily attainable with, 
in 
e.g.,  hot-cathode  electron  guns  whose  pulse  width  can  be  easily  regulated  up  to  a  cw  mode  of  operation. 
Experimentally demonstrated long lifetime of metastable argon up to tens of microseconds at pressures of e-beam-
excited He–Ar mixtures up to several atmospheres can lead, under electron beam-optical pumping, to a comparably 
long-lasting  population  inversion  and  laser  pulse.  Employment  of  appropriate  cw  e-beam  and  optical  pumping 
sources can make possible creation of a cw large-volume high-pressure near-IR He-Ar laser.
