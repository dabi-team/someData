Abstract. The NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron is pursuing
a rich programme on strong interactions, which covers the study of the onset of deconﬁnement
and aims to discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter by performing an energy
and system-size scan over the full CERN SPS beam momentum range. So far the scans of p+p,
p+Pb, Be+Be, and Ar+Sc interactions have been completed, samples of Pb+Pb data at three
energies have already been taken and Xe+La collisions will be registered this year.

Results from the diﬀerent reactions are now emerging, in particular the energy dependence
of hadron spectra and yields as well as ﬂuctuations. This contribution presents status and
preliminary results from this eﬀort, as well as an outlook for future extensions of the strong
interactions programme.

1. Introduction
NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target experiment at the CERN SPS. Tracking is provided by eight time
projection chambers. Additionally, particle identiﬁcation is aided by time-of-ﬂight detectors. A
modular calorimeter is used to determine the collision centrality for nucleus-nucleus collisions.
Both primary and secondary beams are available to the experiment, allowing data taking
with projectile sizes ranging from proton to Pb, as well as with π and K mesons. Besides
studying strong interactions, the experiment also performs precise hadron production reference
measurements for neutrino (Fermilab and T2K) and cosmic-ray (KASCADE and Pierre Auger
Observatory) physics.

The main goal of the strong interactions programme of the NA61/SHINE experiment is to
discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter and study the properties of the onset
of deconﬁnement. The programme is motivated by the discovery of the onset of deconﬁnement
in Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c by the NA49 experiment. To achieve this goal a two-
dimensional scan of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter is performed by varying
the beam momentum (13A-150/158A GeV/c) and the size of the colliding nuclei (p+p, p+Pb,
Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb).

2. Charged K spectra
NA61/SHINE has recently measured charged K production in violent Be+Be and Ar+Sc
collisions at mid-rapidity. The Be+Be analysis was performed for the 20% of events with
the smallest forward energy deposited in the PSD detector - the 20% most violent collisions.
The tof-dE/dx method of particle identiﬁcation was used (measurement in a wider rapidity
range, via the dE/dx method, is in progress). Transverse momentum spectra were ﬁtted [1, 2]
with an exponential function in mT and the resulting inverse slope parameters T are plotted

in Fig. 1. A step followed by a plateau is observed in the energy dependence of the inverse
slope parameter in central Pb+Pb collisions, which was predicted as a signature of the onset
of deconﬁnement [3]. NA61/SHINE results on violent Be+Be collisions and inelastic p+p
interactions are also consistent with such a plateau at SPS energies, though at a lower value of
T .

step-like structure with a following plateau is observed in the energy dependence of the K+/π+
ratio, however, at a much lower level.

Charged K spectra and yields for Ar+Sc interactions were measured at beam momenta of
30A, 40A and 75A GeV/c. Double diﬀerential pT , y spectra were obtained using the dE/dx
method of particle identiﬁcation. Then, spectra extrapolated in pT and rapidity were integrated
to derive mean multiplicities (in 4π) as seen in Fig. 2 (left). There is no clear energy dependence
and no horn structure visible in Ar+Sc collisions. The (cid:104)K+(cid:105)/(cid:104)π+(cid:105) ratio in Ar+Sc collisions is
between the ratio in inelastic p+p interactions and the one in violent Pb+Pb collisions. The
analysis of Ar+Sc data at 13A, 19A and 150A GeV/c is in progress.

3. Multiplicity ﬂuctuations
Multiplicity ﬂuctuations were measured for negatively charged hadrons in Be+Be and Ar+Sc
collisions. For cross-check, two diﬀerent measures were used:
the scaled variance of the
multiplicity distribution, ω[N], and the strongly intensive ﬂuctuation measure Ω[N,EP ] calculated
for the distributions of multiplicity N and energy of projectile participants EP . As expected ω[N]
for very violent (0-1% Be+Be) collisions coincides with Ω[N,EP ] for violent (0-10% Be+Be)
collisions [4].

Figure 3 presents the system size dependence of ω[N] for negatively charged hadrons at
30A and 150/158A GeV/c and shows an interesting eﬀect. A rapid decrease of ω[N] when
moving from violent Be+Be to Ar+Sc collisions is observed. Within the Wounded Nucleon
Model ω[N]AA=ω[N]pp provided the number of wounded nucleons W does not ﬂuctuate (dotted

lines in Fig. 3). The Wounded Nucleon Model with W ﬂuctuations results in ω[N]AA>ω[N]pp.
Thus Ar+Sc results are in qualitative disagreement with predictions of the Wounded Nucleon
Model. For an Ideal Boltzmann gas in the Grand Canonical Ensemble (IB-GCE) formalism
ω[N]=1 (Poisson multiplicity distribution), independently of the (ﬁxed) system volume. Volume
ﬂuctuations increase multiplicity ﬂuctuations resulting in ω[N]>1. Adding resonance decays and
Bose-Einstein statistics would further increase ω[N]. Consequently ω[N]AA<1 is forbidden in the
IB-GCE and its extensions. The observed small values of ω[N] in violent Ar+Sc collisions may
be due to conservation laws acting in a large volume system [5]. In statistical mechanics they
are introduced by using canonical and microcanonical ensembles. Finally, ω[N](cid:29)1, as seen in
p+p reactions at 158A GeV/c, can be understood in statistical models as a result of ﬂuctuations
of the ﬁreball volume and/or the energy converted into particle production [6].

4. System size dependence of particle yields
Figure 4 shows example plots of the system size dependence of the ratio of K+ and π+ yields
at mid-rapidity at two SPS energies. The scaled variance of multiplicity distributions were
already shown in Fig. 3. The Be+Be results are very close to those from p+p interactions
independently of collision energy. Moreover, the data show a jump between light (p+p, Be+Be)
and intermediate/heavy (Ar+Sc, Pb+Pb) systems. The K+/π+ ratio in p+p interactions is
below the predictions of statistical models. However, the ratio in central Pb+Pb collisions is
close to statistical model predictions for large volume systems [7]. In p+p interactions, and thus
also in Be+Be collisions, multiplicity ﬂuctuations are larger than predicted by statistical models
(see Fig. 3). However, they are close to statistical model predictions for large volume systems in
central Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb collisions [5]. Thus the observed rapid change of hadron production
properties that start when moving from Be+Be to Ar+Sc collisions can be interpreted as the
beginning of creation of large clusters of strongly interacting matter.

Furthermore hadron production properties in heavy ion collisions were found to change
sN N ≈10 GeV (for
rapidly with increasing collision energy in the low SPS energy domain,
a recent review see Ref. [8]). The results shown in Figures 1 and 2 indicate that this is also
the case in inelastic p+p interactions and probably also in Be+Be collisions. The phenomenon
in collisions of heavy nuclei is labelled as the onset of deconﬁnement and interpreted as the
beginning of creation of quark-gluon plasma with increasing collision energy [9].

5. φ meson production in p+p collisions
New results on φ meson production were obtained in inelastic p+p interactions at 40, 80, and
158A GeV/c. The ratio of mean multiplicity of φ and π mesons in p+p and central Pb+Pb
collisions as a function of centre of mass energy per nucleon pair
sN N is shown in Figure 5
(left), while the double ratio (Pb+Pb)/(p+p) of the ratios (cid:104)φ(cid:105)/(cid:104)π(cid:105) and (cid:104)K±(cid:105)/(cid:104)π±(cid:105) is presented

in Fig. 5 (right). As seen from Fig. 5 (left) the (cid:104)φ(cid:105)/(cid:104)π(cid:105) ratio increases with
sN N . In Pb+Pb
collisions it is approximately three times larger than in p+p collisions, independently of the
interaction energy. Figure 5 (right) shows that the enhancement between p+p and Pb+Pb of
the double ratio (cid:104)φ(cid:105)/(cid:104)π(cid:105) is close to that of (cid:104)K+(cid:105)/(cid:104)π+(cid:105) and systematically larger than that of
(cid:104)K−(cid:105)/(cid:104)π−(cid:105). More information can be found in Ref. [2].

6. Open Charm measurements
The strong interactions programme of the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS has
been expanded to allow precise measurements of particles with short lifetime. The study of
open charm meson production provides an important tool for new detailed investigations of the
properties of hot and dense matter formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions. In particular, it opens
new possibilities for studies of such phenomena as in-medium parton energy loss and quarkonium
dissociation and possible regeneration, thus bringing new information to probe deconﬁnement.
A new vertex detector was constructed for the NA61/SHINE experiment for measurements
of the very rare processes of open charm production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the SPS. It
was designed to meet the challenges of precise track registration and of high spatial resolution in
primary and secondary vertex reconstruction. A small-acceptance version of the vertex detector,
SAVD (Small Acceptance Vertex Detector), was installed last year with a Pb target in the Pb
beam of 150A GeV/c momentum, and a modest set of data were collected. The main goal of
the ongoing data analysis was to observe a signal from D0 mesons. Figure 6 shows the ﬁrst
indication of D0 production in the K + π decay channel [11].
