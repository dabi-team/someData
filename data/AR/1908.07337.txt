Abstract— Tactile Internet

is envisioned to create a
(TI)
paradigm shift from the content-oriented communications to
steer/control-based communications by enabling real-time trans-
mission of haptic information (i.e., touch, actuation, motion,
vibration, surface texture) over Internet in addition to the
conventional audiovisual and data trafﬁcs. This emerging TI
technology, also considered as the next evolution phase of Internet
of Things (IoT), is expected to create numerous opportunities for
technology markets in a wide variety of applications ranging from
teleoperation systems and Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR)
to automotive safety and eHealthcare towards addressing the
complex problems of human society. However, the realization
of TI over wireless media in the upcoming Fifth Generation
(5G) and beyond networks creates various non-conventional
communication challenges and stringent requirements in terms
of ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability, high data-rate connec-
tivity, resource allocation, multiple access and quality-latency-
rate tradeoff. To this end, this paper aims to provide a holistic
view on wireless TI along with a thorough review of the existing
state-of-the-art, to identify and analyze the involved technical
issues, to highlight potential solutions and to propose future
research directions. First, starting with the vision of TI and recent
advances and a review of related survey/overview articles, we
present a generalized framework for wireless TI in the Beyond 5G
Era including a TI architecture, the main technical requirements,
the key application areas and potential enabling technologies.
Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive review of the ex-
isting TI works by broadly categorizing them into three main
paradigms; namely, haptic communications, wireless AR/VR, and
autonomous, intelligent and cooperative mobility systems. Next,
potential enabling technologies across physical/Medium Access
Control (MAC) and network layers are identiﬁed and discussed
in detail. Also, security and privacy issues of TI applications are
discussed along with some promising enablers. Finally, we present
some open research challenges and recommend promising future
research directions.

10 Mbps per square kilometers areal capacity and 1 ms
round-trip latency [1]. While comparing these requirements
with the current 4G systems, 5G systems need to provide
10× improvement in throughout, a 10× decrease in latency,
a 100× improvement in the trafﬁc capacity, and a 100×
improvement
in the network efﬁciency [2]. Out of these
expected outcomes, two most challenging objectives of the
upcoming 5G and beyond systems are [3]: (i) achieving
ultra-high latency (about or less than 1 ms) and (ii) ultra-high
reliability (“ﬁve-nines” reliability,
i.e., one-in-one-million
chance of failure). Since these two requirements are very
essential
the TI applications, supporting TI
scenarios in wireless systems will bring unique research
challenges, and thus is the focus of this paper.

The emerging TI envisions the paradigm shift of the content-
oriented communications to the steer/control-based communi-
cations towards empowering people to control both the real
and virtual objects via wireless channels [4, 5]. In other words,
TI is envisioned to remotely provide the real-time control
and physical tactile experiences, and transform the content-

IoT incorporating Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Human-to-
Machine (H2M) interactions. It has a wide range of application
scenarios in the industrial, eHealthCare, education and enter-
tainment sectors, and it aims to revolutionize various aspects
of our everyday life [5]. As an example in the eHealthCare
sector, a remote surgery operation can be considered, which
requires the surgeon to perform the operation of a patient
at the distance by feeling the sensation of the touch and
providing force-feedback via haptic clothing/equipment and
by implementing the required control actions and adjustments
[7]. Another important example for the TI is a road safety
scenario [4], in which providing ultra-low latency and ultra-
high reliable communications is a crucial requirement for the
safety of passengers.

A. Vision for TI and Recent Advances

The TI is envisioned to be the next generation of IoT and to
revolutionize various societal, economical and cultural aspects
of our everyday life by enabling H2M interactions and real-
time communication in Beyond 5G (B5G) networks. The TI
will add various new features to the future IoT and B5G
networks such as high availability, ultra-fast reaction times,
high security, carrier-grade reliability and remote control of
haptic/tactile machines [8]. In contrast to the conventional
Internet and wireless networks which usually act as a medium

for audio and visual information, TI will provide a medium for
the transmission of touch and actuation in the real time along
with the audiovisual information. Although there are differ-
ences among the concepts of 5G, IoT networks and TI being
discussed in the literature in terms of enabling devices and
underlying communication paradigms, there exists a common
set of requirements for future B5G networks including ultra-
high reliability of about 99.999%, very low latency of about 1
ms, the coexistence of Human-Type-Communications (HTC)
and Machine-Type-Communications (MTC) and security [9].
The main focus of TI is on H2M communications and remote
operation by utilizing various tactile/haptic devices. In addi-
tion, the emerging M2M communications is also important
in TI use-cases including vehicles’ electronic stability control
and industrial robots [8].

Furthermore, TI is expected to signiﬁcantly enhance the
wellbeing of human life by contributing to various sectors
including personal safety, education, road trafﬁc, energy and
healthcare. Moreover, TI will contribute to address the com-
plex challenges faced by today’s human society such as
increasing demand for mobility, demographic changes with the
growing ageing population and transition to renewable energy
production [8]. More speciﬁcally, TI will enable a wide range
of applications and business use-cases including teleoperation
systems, wireless Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality
(VR), remote driving, cooperative automotive driving, smart
energy systems, Internet of drones, eHealthcare, intelligent
trafﬁc control, and tactile robots. In addition, various mis-
sion critical applications including transportation, healthcare,
mobility, manufacturing and transportation, and also the non-
critical applications including edutainment and events can be
considered promising use-cases of TI [10].

However, existing network infrastructures are conceptually
and technically insufﬁcient to support the emerging TI ap-
plications. TI brings various non-conventional demands and
stringent requirements in future B5G networks in terms of
reliability,
latency, sensors/actuators, access networks, sys-
tem architecture and mobile edge-clouds [8]. The design
requirements of TI systems/devices to achieve real-time in-
teractions are dependent on the participating human senses
since the speed of human’s interaction with the underlying
system/environment is limited by our perceptual processes.
Also, it is crucial to adapt the feedback of the system based
on human reaction time.

In addition to very low end-to-end latency and ultra-
high reliability design requirements of the TI, data secu-
rity, availability and dependability of systems need to be
ensured without violating the low-latency requirements while
also taking into account of encryption delays. Nevertheless,
existing centralized architectures are not sufﬁcient to meet
these requirements and more distributed network architectures
based on mobile-edge computing and cloudlets need to be
investigated to bring the TI applications closer to the end-
users [9]. Also,
to redesign future wireless
access networks by investigating novel resource allocation,
feedback mechanisms, interference management and medium-
access control techniques in order to meet the stringent re-
liability and latency requirements of TI applications [8]. In

it

addition to the enhancement in various aspects of physical
and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers, emerging network
technologies including Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN),
Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network coding and
edge/fog computing are considered promising paradigms for
supporting the TI applications in future B5G networks [11].
Over the last decade, there has been a signiﬁcant research at-
tention in developing smart tactile sensing systems, which are
mainly composed of tactile sensors (capacitive, piezo-resistive,
piezoelectric and optical) and intelligent signal processing
tools having the capability of information interpretation and
taking decisions [12]. However, several interdisciplinary re-
search efforts are needed in designing smart tactile sensing
systems in terms of device materials, fabrication technologies,
signal processing and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to
deal with the complex multi-dimensional data from the tactile
sensors. In addition, the transmission of tactile sense/data over
the wireless Internet while enabling the remote touch feeling
as well as the remote control, is another crucial aspect to be
addressed. In addition, various aspects of underlying wireless
communication networks such as reliability, latency, security
and availability need to be taken into the design of TI systems.
Several standardization works are expected in the near future
to create synergies between the TI’s application areas and the
evolution of existing wireless networks. From the regulatory
standards perspective, by considering TI under a “Technology
Watch” area, the telecommunication standardization sector of
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has published
a report on various aspects of TI including the applications in
both the mission-critical and non-critical areas, the advantages
for the society and implications for the equipment [13].

In terms of the ongoing standardization, a new standard
family IEEE P1918.X “Tactile Internet” has been deﬁned [14].
The scope of the baseline TI standard IEEE P1981.1 is to
deﬁne a TI framework, incorporating the descriptions of its
deﬁnitions and terminology, including the necessary functions
and technical assumptions, as well as the application scenarios
[10]. Within this, IEEE P1918.X deﬁnes the architecture
technology and assumptions in TI systems, IEEE P1918.X.1 is
dedicated for Codecs for the TI, IEEE P1918.X.2 is focussed
on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) for Tactile Internet and IEEE
P1918.X.3 is working towards MAC for the TI. Also, the
Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) (initiated by GE, CISCO,
AT&T, Intel and IBM, and which later supported by 160
companies) is developing a standard for low-latency Industrial
IoT (IIoT) for different smart cyber-physical systems including
smart transportation systems, smart manufacturing, and smart
healthcare systems [15, 16].

B. Review of Related Overview/Survey Articles

of IoT, massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC),
M2M communications, Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Com-
munications (URLLC), but only a few in the area of TI.
In Table I, we list the related topics under these domains
and the existing overview/survey articles. The existing survey
and overview articles [17–25] have discussed various aspects

of IoT/mMTC/M2M and URLLC systems including enabling
technologies/protocols, applications and challenges. Further-
more, the article [30] discussed various challenges and future
perspectives for scheduling M2M transmissions over LTE
networks and another article [31] provided a comprehensive
classiﬁcation of transmission scheduling techniques from the
M2M communications perspective. Moreover, some survey
and overview articles provided a comprehensive discussion
on various aspects of IoT data analytics including the related
architectures [32], network methodologies for real-time data
analytics [33] and collaborative edge-cloud processing [34].
In addition,
the authors in [35] provided an overview of
recent advances in information theoretic principles towards
characterizing the transmission of short packet transmissions
in IoT/mMTC systems.

In the direction of latency reduction techniques, which is
very crucial for TI applications, a few overview and survey
papers exist [36–38]. The authors in [36] provided a detailed
survey on the emerging technologies to achieve low latency
communications by considering different domains including
Radio Access Network (RAN), core network and caching
network. Another article [37] provided a thorough classiﬁ-
cation of latency reduction techniques based on the sources
of delay along with a comparison of the merits of different
techniques. In addition, the article [38] reviewed the URLLC
requirements for 3GPP LTE Releases 14 and 15 and 5G New
Radio (NR), and discussed novel enhancements to design the
control channels towards supporting URLLC.

In the area of TI, the authors in [4] provided a brief overview
of emerging TI application scenarios mainly in the areas of
healthcare, mobility, education, smart grids and manufacturing.
Another overview article in [9] discussed the vision, recent
advances and open challenges of TI by focusing on the
reliability and latency performance gains of Fiber-Wireless
(FiWi) enhanced LTE-Advanced networks. Furthermore, the
article [39] presented the technological concepts underlying
the intersection of emerging 5G systems and TI scenarios,
and outlined the key technical requirements and architectural
methods for TI regarding wireless access protocols, radio
resource management and edge-cloud capabilities.

In the context of haptic communications, there exist a few
overview and survey papers in the literature [5, 40, 41, 53]. The
authors in [40] provided a state-of-the-art review in haptic
communications both from the technical and psychophysical
perspectives, and also discussed the need of various objective

quality metrics for haptic communications. Another article [5]
provided a survey of the methodologies and technologies for
incorporating haptic communications in the 5G TI systems,
and also discussed various aspects related to haptic tele-
operation systems, haptic data reduction and compression,
haptic control systems and haptic data communication pro-
tocols. Furthermore, the overview article [41] discussed the
state-of-the-art and challenges of haptic data compression and
communication for teleaction and telepresence operations. In
the authors in [53] provided a summary of the
addition,
requirements and challenges of haptic communications along
with some possible solutions.

With regard to wireless AR/VR, the authors in [42] high-
lighted the importance of VR as a disruptive use-case for
5G and beyond wireless systems, and subsequently discussed
potential research avenues and scientiﬁc challenges for the
implementation of interconnected VR over wireless links.
Also, three different VR case studies related to joint resource
allocation and computing, proactive versus reactive computing,
and AR-enabled self-driving vehicles, were presented.

C. Contributions of the Paper

Although there exist a few surveys and overview articles in
the areas of TI, they fail to provide a holistic view on wireless
TI along with the issues involved with the transmission of
tactile trafﬁc in addition to the conventional audio-visual
and data trafﬁcs over the complex wireless communications
environment. In this direction, the main objectives of this
survey paper are: to provide a comprehensive view on wireless
TI along with a generalized TI framework (Fig. 2 in Section
II), to discuss current issues towards supporting TI applications
in 5G and beyond wireless networks, to provide a detailed
review of recent advances in the 5G and beyond TI use-cases,
to propose potential enabling technologies for wireless TI, to
identify open issues and to suggest future research directions.
In the following, we brieﬂy highlight the main contributions
of this survey paper.

1) We propose a generalized framework for wireless TI,
identify its main components, and subsequently discuss
various aspects of wireless TI including a basic TI ar-
chitecture, key technical requirements, main application

domains, namely, haptic communications, wireless

Section II-A. Furthermore, several physical/MAC layer and
cloud/network level technologies highlighted in Fig. 2 are
detailed in Section VI.

In the following subsections, we present a generalized
architecture of TI, the key technical requirements, the main
applications areas of TI, and a brief discussion on the state-
of-the-art work related to the analysis of existing technologies
with regard to the technical requirements of TI.

A. Tactile Internet Architecture

In contrast to the conventional Internet utilized for trans-
mitting audio and video information, TI envisions to transmit
touch and actuation information in addition to the audiovisual
information. From the communication perspective, the main
difference is that the feedback in an TI system can be in

terms of various kinesthetic and vibro-tactile parameters such
as position, motion, vibration and surface texture in addition
to audio/vidual feedback, thus forming a global control loop
while the conventional system utilizes only the audio/visual
feedback without any control
the haptic
sense in TI applications occurs bilaterally, for example, in a
telepresence system, the motion (i.e., velocity or position) is
transmitted to the tele-operator and the force/torque from the
environment is sent back to the Human System Interface (HSI)
[40].

loop [39]. Also,

In Fig. 3, we present a generalized architecture of a TI
system, which mainly comprises a master domain, a network
domain and a controlled domain. The master domain generally
consists of a human operator (tactile user) and the HSI,
which is responsible for converting the human input to the
tactile data by utilizing suitable tactile encoding techniques.
The tactile data generated by the HSI is transmitted to the

controlled domain via the network domain. The controlled
domain or environment comprises a remotely controlled robot
or teleoperator and with the help of various command signals
(i.e., velocity, position), the master domain directly controls
the controlled domain. The controlled domain then provides
feedback signals (i.e., force/position, surface texture) to the
master domain. In addition to the haptic feedback signals,
the master domain also receives audio/visual feedback signals
from the controlled domain. The master domain and controlled
domains are connected via a two-way communication link over
the network domain with the help of various command and
feedback signals, forming a global control loop. Out of the

aforementioned components of TI, the main focus of this paper
will be on the network domain, i.e., communication network.

The network domain of the TI system acts as the commu-
nication channel between tactile users (master domain) and
the remotely controlled environment (controlled domain). This
communication domain may be composed of an Internet/core
network, a Radio Access Network (RAN), and a tactile support
engine as depicted in Fig. 3. Furthermore, the underlying com-
munication channel needs to satisfy various requirements such
as ultra-responsive connectivity and ultra-reliable connectivity
highlighted later in Section II-B. The upcoming B5G net-
works should be adapted to satisfy these requirements towards

supporting emerging TI applications. The main functions of
B5G core network to support a TI system include handling of
edge-cloud interactions and access, application-aware Quality
of Service (QoS) provisioning and security. Similarly,
the
key functions of B5G RAN in the context of TI system
include the efﬁcient support of heterogeneous Radio Access
Technologies (RATs) including the conventional LTE/LTE-A
based cellular, 5G New Radio and emerging B5G technologies,
radio resource management and QoS aware scheduling of TI
users, the coexistence of TI applications with other verticals
including Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
(V2I), smart grid, M2M, and provisioning of reliable packet
delivery. Furthermore, the transmission and synchronization of
heterogeneous data streams via the communication medium
may face challenges due to packet loss, higher packet rate
and variable delay, demanding for intelligent packet-switched
network protocols capable of analyzing the network situations,
synchronizing the data streams and provisioning the required
QoS [43].

B. Key Technical Requirements

The main technical requirements for the TI include the

following [39, 44].

1) Ultra-responsive Connectivity: Most of the TI appli-
cations require the end-to-end latency/round trip delay
to be in the order of about 1 ms. The end-to-end
latency refers to the summation of the transmission
times required while sending the information from a
sensor/device (or human for the case of haptic com-
munication) via the communication infrastructure to a
control server, the information processing time at the
server, the processing at different communication hops
(i.e., routers, switches), and the retransmission times via
the communication infrastructure back to the end-device
(or human).

2) Ultra-reliable Connectivity: Another

important

re-
quirement for the TI is the ultra-reliable network con-
nectivity, in which reliability refers to the probability to
guarantee a required performance under given system
constraints and conditions over a certain time interval.
As an example, factory automation scenario in a smart
factory demands a reliability of about 99.999% for about
1 ms latency [45]. One of the potential solutions to
enhance the reliability for TI applications is to employ

concurrent connections with multiple links [46], and
also to utilize multiple paths for graph connectivity to
avoid a single point of failure. However, this approach
depends on the channel dynamics and the availability of
Channel State Information (CSI) knowledge. Including
higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) margins in the link
budget and employing stronger channel coding are also
important solutions towards enhancing the reliability of
a communication link. Improving the reliability will also
help to reduce the latency due to the lower number of
resulting retransmissions.

3) Distributed Edge Intelligence: Suitable Artiﬁcial Intel-
ligence (AI)/ML techniques need to be investigated to be
employed at the edge-side of the wireless TI networks
in order to facilitate the interpolation/extrapolation of
human activities and predictive caching for reducing the
end-to-end latency. Furthermore, AI/ML-based predic-
tive actuation methods need to be investigated in order
to enhance the range of tactile services/applications.
4) Transmission and Processing of Tactile Data: To
facilitate the transmission of tactile information over the
packet-switched networks, tactile encoding mechanisms
need to be developed. Also, to handle the highly multi-
dimensional nature of human tactile perception, an ef-
fective audio/visual sensory feedback mechanism needs
to be investigated.

5) Security and Privacy: Other key requirements of the
TI are security and privacy under strict latency con-
straints. To fulﬁll
layer
security techniques with low computational overhead,
secure coding techniques, and reliable and low-latency
methods to identify the legitimate receivers, need to be
investigated.

these requirements, physical

C. Application Areas

As highlighted earlier,

the TI is expected to inﬂuence
various aspects of human society and has a wide range of
application areas ranging from eHealthCare to industrial au-
tomation. Some of the application scenarios speciﬁed in the lit-
erature include [5]: (i) Haptic communications, (ii) Augmented
Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR), (iii) Remote monitoring
and surgery, (iv) Wireless controlled exoskeletons, (v) Remote
education (tele-mentoring), (vi) Remote driving/autonomous
vehicles, (vii) Trafﬁc control, (viii) Industrial tele-operation

including robotics and manufacturing, (ix) Smart grid, and (x)
Smart city.

Furthermore, the baseline TI standard IEEE 1918.1 has
provided the key features and performance metrics of the
following use-cases [47]: (i) Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR),
(ii) teleoperation, (iii) automotive, (iv) Internet of drones, (v)
interpersonal communications, (vi) live haptic-enabled broad-
cast and (vii) cooperative automotive driving. For example,
for IVR applications, the trafﬁc type for the slave (haptic
users) to master (IVR systems) is haptic feedback while in the
direction of master to slave, video, audio and haptic feedback
trafﬁc types are involved. For this IVR application, the latency
requirement for haptic feedback in the slave to master direction
is < 5 ms while in the other direction (master to slave), video
and audio have the latency requirement of < 10 ms and for
haptic feedback, the latency requirement is 1 − 50 ms [47].
The aforementioned main TI applications can be categorized
under the following headings [39, 48].

1. Teleoperation or remote Operation Systems: These
systems can perform the manipulation of
tasks in dis-
tant/inaccessible and hazardous places by enabling the inter-
action of humans with real/virtual objects. With the help of
haptic information, various aspects such as motion, vibration,
texture and force can be communicated to create the feeling
of being present in the remote environment. In contrast to
the conventional wired solutions over short distance, wireless
teleoperation systems face challenges in terms of meeting
the strict requirements of latency and reliability for timely
and reliable remote interaction. To this end, TI ﬁnds an
important application in enabling the remote interactions over
long distances via wireless links.

2. Immersive Entertainment and Edutainment Systems:
Another important application of TI is the entertainment
industry where the TI can enable a range of new immersive
entertainment services via real-time transmission of multi-
sensory information including audio, video and haptic. Also,
new gaming applications will beneﬁt from the emerging VR
and AR systems. Furthermore, live haptic broadcasting over
TI can provide the feeling of live event to the end-users [49].
Moreover, by enabling the haptic interaction between teachers
and students, TI can provide a completely new method of edu-
cation, thus enabling new edutainment applications. However,
this leads to the challenge of having a multimodal (auditory,
visual and haptic) H2M interface capable of operating with
very low end-to-end latency.

3. Autonomous, Intelligent and Cooperative Mobility
Systems: Under intelligent mobility systems, the main ap-
plications of TI include autonomous driving, remote driving,
vehicle platooning, virtually coupled train systems, aerial
drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Vehicle-to-
Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) commu-
nication systems are essential for self-driving capabilities in
future wireless systems. The aforementioned autonomous,
intelligent and cooperative mobility systems require future TI
systems to meet the stringent constraints in terms of latency,
reliability and stability control.

4. Wireless Networked Control Systems (NCS): Wireless
NCSs are distributed systems consisting of sensors, actuators,

and controllers, in which the control and feedback signals are
exchanged over a common communication network with the
help of a global control loop with strict latency constraints. The
NCSs face the challenge of instability in wireless channels due
to the involved time delays and packet losses and TI may be
a promising paradigm to enable wireless NCSs by providing
highly reliable and ultra-low latency connectivity solutions.

5. Smart Energy Systems: With the recent advances in
smart grid technologies, the existing energy ecosystem is being
transferred to Internet of Energy (IoE), which can enable
various operations such as distributed energy generation, in-
terconnected storage network and demand-side response [48].
The TI may provide ultra-responsive connectivity to meet
the challenge of achieving high dynamic control over the
distributed energy supply units since out-of-phase synchro-
nization power injection may result in the unusable reactive
power [8].

6. Tactile Robots: With the recent advances in electronics,
human-machine interaction technologies, AI techniques, and
haptic devices, the recently emerged kinesthetic soft robot
is expected to evolve its next generation, i.e., Tactile Robot.
Tactile Robot is envisioned to provide fully immersive remote
representation of a human enhanced with the AI and with
the capability of performing physical interactions and high-
ﬁdelity feedback to a human operator over signiﬁcant distances
[50]. Such a feedback from the tactile robot to the human is
provided with the help of connected wearables and various
modules such as tactile sensing, temperatures, pressure and
audiovisual perception. Over the current generation of soft
robots,
tactile robot provides several advantages including
safety algorithms, interoceptive and exteroceptive tactile feed-
back and enhanced quality metrics [50].

7. Industrial Automation: The industrial automation in
smart factories is one of the key application areas of the TI.
The emerging industrial revolution, i.e, Industry 4.0 consisting
of storage systems, smart machines and production facilities,
is expected to have the capabilities of real-time response,
autonomous information exchange over wireless,
increased
ﬂexibility, and self-organization [51]. In contrast to the today’s
control systems, future industrial control systems are expected
to be fully or partially operating over wireless links to enhance
the production ﬂexibility. This causes several issues to be
addressed in terms of reliability, latency, energy consumption
and security. Various industrial applications may have different
data rate, end-to-end latency and security requirements [52].
The emerging TI solutions may be signiﬁcantly useful in
meeting these requirements towards enabling full automation,
and highly agile and ﬂexible production process in smart
factories.

The aforementioned applications of TI can be broadly
considered under the following three main paradigms: (i)
haptic communications, (ii) wireless augmented and virtual
reality, and (iii) autonomous, intelligent and cooperative mo-
bility Systems, which are discussed in detail along with the
existing state-of-the-art review in Section III, Section IV and
Section V, respectively. In Table III, we have listed the main
research themes under these categories and the corresponding
references.

D. Feasibility Analysis of Existing Wireless Technologies

Since existing wireless technologies and protocols are
mostly designed for the conventional HTC trafﬁc, they are
not sufﬁcient to meet
the stringent latency and reliability
requirements of emerging TI applications which require M2M
and M2H interactions [78]. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze
the feasibility of the existing technologies/protocols for TI
application scenarios and to explore the adaptations of the
existing protocols for TI applications. In this regard, some
recent works have analyzed the feasibility of a few techniques
for TI applications in different settings, which are brieﬂy
discussed below.

The factory automation can be considered as an example
use case of TI, which has very strict requirements in terms
of latency and reliability, i.e., end-to-end latency of about
1 ms with a failure rate as low as 10−9 [45]. In contrast
to the conventional factory automation case which is mostly
based on the wired connectivity, location ﬂexibility of a large
number of various devices in a factory can be enhanced
with the robust and deterministic wireless connectivity. In this
regard, authors in [45] analyzed the feasibility of designing an
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based
5G radio interface for a mission critical MTC application.
By considering a factory automation example, the authors
showed the possibility of achieving sub-millisecond latency
and high reliability with a very high availability of coverage
while employing the considered OFDM-based 5G radio in-
terface. Furthermore, considering the similar factory automa-
tion scenario, authors in [79] explored the viability of using
wireless communications for low-latency and high-reliability
communications. Via simulation results, it has been shown that
by utilizing spatial diversity and short transmission intervals
without retransmissions, it is possible to obtain very low error
rates and delays over a wireless channel even in the scenarios
with fast fading signals, interference, antenna correlation and
channel estimation errors. Also, by considering a realistic
factory environment, authors in [80] evaluated the performance
of LTE and 5G cellular systems by considering the connection
of Base Station (BS) to the automated programmable logical
controller with a negligible latency. Via numerical results,
authors highlighted the need of new 5G radio interface for
the applications with about 99.999% reliability and less than
1 ms end-to-end latency requirements.

Another TI application scenario is the video communica-
tions system, which is envisioned to support emerging cyber-

physical networking, NCSs and dynamic interactive applica-
tions. In video communications, the end-to-end delay usually
refers to glass-to-glass delay, which is deﬁned as the difference
in time from the photons of an event passing via the glass
of a camera lens to the corresponding photons displayed on a
monitor being passed through the display’s glass [81]. Current
video systems suffer from a signiﬁcantly large glass-to-glass
delay of about 50 ms to 400 ms, which depends on the physical
separation of two ends and how many networks the photons
have to traverse. Through experimental results conducted in an
Android platform, authors in [82] showed that current digital
video applications are not yet suited for TI applications. Thus,
there is a crucial need to lower the video communications
delay in order to satisfy the requirements of TI applications
such as tele-operation, autonomous connected driving and
wireless AR/VR.

Due to time-varying channel fading and interference, pro-
viding reliable communications in wireless environments be-
comes challenging. To satisfy the stringent reliability require-
ments, one can study the signal quality outage performance by
analyzing some suitable performance metrics such as Signal to
Noise plus Interference (SINR) outage. In this regard, authors
in [83] performed the signal quality outage performance
analysis of a cellular network and noted that the conventional
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems with 2 × 2
or 4 × 4 antenna conﬁgurations are not sufﬁcient to satisfy
the stringent reliability requirements. To enhance this per-
formance, the same authors suggested to utilize macroscopic
diversity as well as interference management techniques along
with MIMO schemes to enhance the SINR outage perfor-
mance of a cellular network. However, while employing the
considered MIMO diversity techniques, diversity-multiplexing
tradeoff issue should be properly taken into account.

In terms of lab experimentation, authors in [84] demon-
strated the implementation of a Software Deﬁned Radio (SDR)
based wireless broadband communication system with 20
MHz bandwidth and measured the basic performance indica-
tors (throughput and delay) via the end-to-end measurements.
Via experimental results, the authors showed the feasibility of
real-time implementation of very low delay with a round-trip
delay of about 1 ms on an SDR-based platform. However, the
experiment was carried out with a single wireless link in a
basic setting without considering any interfering sources, and
various delay components such as queueing delay and protocol
delay were neglected.

Furthermore, authors in [85] studied the feasibility of the

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

10

existing IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) technology for low-latency TI
applications while considering both the IEEE 802.11 Direct-
Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) and IEEE 802.11g OFDM
schemes. Mainly, the effect of imperfect synchronization re-
sulting from the physically uncoupled devices utilized for
simultaneous Wi-Fi transmissions, i.e., concurrent timing off-
set and concurrent frequency offset, were studied with the
help of simulations by using SDR-based testbeds. The results
indicated different behaviors of the IEEE 802.11 DSSS and
IEEE 802.11 OFDM systems with regard to the aforemen-
tioned limiting factors resulted from concurrent transmissions.
Also, the main parameter limits under which the IEEE 802.11
technology can support ultra low-latency TI applications were
identiﬁed. Moreover, authors in [78] investigated the potential
of one of the latest MAC protocols of IEEE 802.11 networks,
namely the Hybrid Coordination function controlled Channel
Access (HCCA), towards supporting TI applications. Mainly,
the wireless queuing latency from a tactile user to the access
point has been analyzed for the IEEE 802.11 HCCA protocol,
and its closed-form expression has been provided which can
be used to select suitable HCCA parameters towards satisfying
the desired latency requirement. Besides these MAC protocols,
it is important to design load-aware MAC protocols for TI
applications since the latency and reliability are very much
dependent on the network trafﬁc load.

One of the enabling platforms for haptic communica-
tions in Internet enabled eHealthCare applications is Wireless
Body Area Networks (WBANs), where the on-body actua-
tors/sensors can be used to support steering/control and haptic
communications. The Smart Body Area Network (SmartBAN)
proposed by European Telecommunication Standards Institute
(ETSI) in 2015 [86] is considered as an important ultra-
low power and low-complexity WBAN technology for health
monitoring and reporting applications. In this regard, authors
in [87] carried out the delay performance analysis of downlink
transmission for SmartBANs with the objective of meeting the
1 ms delay constraint required for TI applications. Also, the
downlink delay of the SmartBAN system was modelled analyt-
ically and the impact of the selection of downlink transmission
duration on the downlink delay and energy performance was
studied. Via numerical results, it was shown that in contrast
to the conventional exhaustive transmission, a ﬁxed length
transmission mechanism can provide less than 1 ms delay
required for TI Healthcare applications.

The TI applications depend on the interactions of human
beings with the environment via our senses and these interac-
tion times depend on the sensory stimulus as well as the state
of whether the human is prepared for a particular situation or
not [13]. A faster reaction time is needed when a human is
prepared for a scenario. The speed of this interaction is limited
with our perceptual processes and the technical requirements
of TI systems required for real-time interactions depend on
the involved human senses. For example, the reaction time for
human auditory sense is about 100 ms and modern telephone
systems have been designed to transmit voice within 100 ms
in order not to feel the delayed conversation. Similarly, the
typical reaction time for human visual sense is in the range of
10 ms and modern TV sets use the minimum picture refresh

rate of about 100 Hz (which translates to the maximum inter-
picture delay of about 10 ms) for the users to experience
seamless video. However, very rapid response time of about 1
ms is required in the scenarios where speed is important for
humans including a response from the visual display and the
movement of heads while using VR goggles.

III. HAPTIC COMMUNICATIONS OVER WIRELESS TI

Haptic communications provides an additional dimension
over the conventional audiovisual communication to enable
truly immersive steering and control in remote environments
[54]. Although audio/visual information can provide the feel-
ing of being present in the remote environment, it is not
possible to have complete immersion without the exchange of
haptic information in the form of various parameters such as
force, motion, vibration and texture. The process of sending
command signals from the user to the remote environment
and the reception of the haptic feedback signals from the
remote environment form a closed control loop in a haptic
communication system [55].

The haptic communications using networked tele-operation
systems is one of the important application areas of the TI,
which demands for an efﬁcient and timely exchange of kines-
thetic or tactile information. In contrast to the communications
of audio and video signals, haptic signals in the bilateral
tele-operation systems are bidirectionally exchanged over the
networks, thus creating a global control loop between the
human users and the teleoperators/actuators [5]. The haptic
communications and TI have the service and medium rela-
tionship similar to the relation between voice over Internet
protocol and the Internet [54].

As depicted earlier in Fig. 3, a haptic communication
system usually consists of a master device (user) at one end,
a communication network in between, and the slave device
(tele-operator) at the other end. The master device sends the
position and/or velocity data while the slave device transmits
the haptic feedback data (surface texture, force/position) along
with the audio and video data streams via the underlying
communication channel [5].

The haptic sense, i.e., the sense of touch establishes the
links between the unknown environments and humans similar
to audio and visual senses. The main difference from the audio
and visual sense is that the haptic sense occurs bilaterally.
The haptic feedback is usually of two types: (i) kinesthetic
feedback which provides information about the velocity, force,
position and torque, and (ii) tactile feedback which provides
information about the texture, surface and friction [55].

A. Key Challenges

The main challenges for realizing haptic communications

over the wireless TI include the following [43, 53, 54].

1) Ultra-High Reliability: One of the crucial requirements
of TI applications over wireless networks is ultra-high
reliability, which can be impacted due to a number
of factors in wireless networks such as the lack of
resources, uncontrollable interference, reduced signal

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

11

strength and equipment failure [88]. Although the con-
ventional video and voice applications naturally allow
the graceful degradation of service quality in worse com-
munication situations, this is not applicable for haptic
applications due to the possible unstable situation which
may result from the delayed arrival or the loss of critical
haptic information [54]. Also, various layers of the
conventional protocol stack including the MAC layer,
transport layer and session layer need to be revisited to
enable ultra-high reliability in haptic communications.
For example, in the transport layer, the Transport Control
Protocol (TCP) provides high reliability at the expense
of a very high protocol and high latency while the user
datagram protocol can provide low protocol overhead
but at the cost of reliability [43, 53]. Also, maintaining
a small packet header to the payload ratio is one of the
main issues since the payload of haptic data packet for
3-DoF (Degrees of Freedom) haptic system is only 6
bytes, but the header size in IPV6 version is 40 bytes
[54].

2) Ultra-Responsive Connectivity: There are several chal-
lenges in achieving about 1 ms end-to-end latency re-
quired by many TI applications. All the factors contribut-
ing to this end-to-end latency across different protocols-
layers, air interface, backhaul, hardware and core In-
ternet, should be optimized to meet
this target. For
example,
layer, shorter Transmission
in the physical
Time Interval (TTI) is highly desirable to lower the
over-the-air latency, but this will require higher available
bandwidth. After investigating optimum combinations,
the achievable end-to-end latency is limited by the ﬁnite
speed of light, which sets an upper bound for the
maximum separation between the tactile ends.

3) Efﬁcient Resource Allocation: The radio allocation in
wireless/cellular networks becomes challenging with the
incorporation of haptic communications since the avail-
able resources need to be shared between haptic commu-
nications and Human-to-Human (H2H) communications
or machine-type communications, which have diverse
and conﬂicting service requirements. Among these sys-
tems, haptic communications should get priority for
resources due to its stringent QoS requirements. Also,
due to the bidirectional nature of haptic communications,
symmetric resource allocation with the guarantee of
minimum constant rate in both the uplink and the down-
link is required. Furthermore, ﬂexible resource allocation
techniques across different protocols layers including
adaptive ﬂow management and network slicing [89] with
the on-demand functionality needs to be investigated to
enable the coexistence of haptic communications with
other systems.

4) Multi-Modal Sensory Information: TI systems need
to consider audio and visual feedback in addition to
the haptic feedback in order to have the increased
perceptual performance. The main challenge here is
the cross-modal asynchrony, which may arise due to
the heterogeneous requirements of haptic, visual and
auditory modalities in terms of various parameters such

as latency, transmission rate and sampling rate. This
leads to the need of effective multiplexing scheme which
can integrate these different modalities by exploiting
their priorities. Although some works [90, 91] in the
literature have suggested application layer-based multi-
plexing schemes, further research on exploring effective
multiplexing schemes across different protocol layers
for integrating the aforementioned modalities in dynam-
ically varying wireless environments is needed.

5) Collaborative Multi-User Haptic Communications:
In multiuser haptic scenarios, multiple users need to
interact and collaborate in a shared remote environment,
thus requiring the formation of a peer-to-peer overlay
to enable the collaboration among multiple users [92].
This overlay creation step raises additional challenges
in terms of meeting the requirements of TI applications
since the overlay routing and IP-level routing may
further increase the end-to-end latency [54].

6) Area-Based Sensing and Actuation: In contrast to
the most existing haptic devices with the single-point
contact for the tactile and kinesthetic feedbacks, hap-
tic communications need to deal with the touch-based
sensations across the surfaces including the palm of
the hand or other parts of the body. For this purpose,
area-based or distributed sensing and actuation needs to
be incorporated in haptic devices [54]. Also, this will
signiﬁcantly impact the conventional communication re-
quirements due to the increased data rates and a different
perception for the case of a data loss.

7) Deﬁnition of Novel Performance Metrics: A common
approach to evaluate and compare the performance of
different haptic communications systems is still not
available and it is important to investigate suitable per-
formance metrics towards analyzing and comparing the
performance of various haptic systems over the TI [93].
A suitable mapping between the QoS metrics delivered
by the involved communication networks and haptic
data processing techniques (data reduction/control) is
necessary for the development of novel
joint opti-
mization techniques for communications, compression
and control. Some key performance metrics to eval-
uate the performance of haptic communications over
TI include Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and Quality-of-
Task (QoT). Out of these metrics, QoE mostly refers
to the difference of the physical interaction across a
network and the same manipulation carried out locally,
thus deﬁning the transparency of the system [94]. On
the other hand, QoT measures the accuracy by which a
tactile user can perform a particular task [93].

8) Stability for Haptic Control: The global control loop
in haptic communication involves different entities in-
cluding the human, the communication network, the
remote environment, and the energy exchange among
these components takes place via various commands and
feedback signals [54]. However, in practical wireless
environments, the system instability may arise due to
time varying delays and packet losses. Therefore, one
of the main challenges in wireless TI systems is to

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

12

maintain the stability of the control loop system since
the instability may lead to a signiﬁcant degradation of
the impressiveness to the remote environment.

9) Haptic Codecs: In order to perform the digitization of
haptic information, haptic signals are usually sampled at
the rate of 1 kHz, generating 1000 packets per second
[53]. Although different haptic data compression tech-
niques have been investigated by utilizing the limits of
human haptic communications, the main challenge in the
context of TI applications is to develop a standard family
of haptic codecs by incorporating both the kinesthetic
and tactile information. Also, the developed haptic codes
should be able to perform effectively in time-varying
wireless environments.

10) Haptic Sensors and Actuators: Haptic devices such
as haptic sensors and haptic actuators are important
components of haptic communications systems. Among
these devices, haptic sensors sense the tactile informa-
tion by interacting with the surroundings and they are
usually mounted at the tele-operator end. This sensed
information is then relayed back and transmitted to the
end-user in the form of the haptic feedback by the haptic
actuators (also called haptic feedback devices). In the
following, we brieﬂy describe the functionalities of these
devices and the associated issues [53].
Haptic sensors are mainly pressure sensors to detect the
underlying pressure. They mostly follow the capacitive
and resistive methods. The capacitive sensor is made
up of a ﬂexible dielectric in between two conducting
plates and the change in the capacitance occurs due to
a reduction in the distance between these two plates
caused by the pressure to be measured. On the other
hand, a resistive method uses a pressure-sensitive resis-
tive material whose resistance changes upon applying
the pressure. This resulted pressure in both cases can
then be measured with the help of an electric circuit
and digitized with an analog to digital converter. In
terms of the underlying materials, the capacitive haptic
sensors mostly use elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (also
called silicone) as a dielectric, while the resistive haptic
sensors commonly use pressure sensitive piezo-resistive
materials.
The main issues associated with the capacitative sen-
sors include non-idealities and sensitivity. Furthermore,
regardless of the type of the haptic devices, several pa-
rameters such as range, sensitivity, response time, spatial
resolution, cost, temperature dependance and complexity
need to be taken into account when selecting a haptic
sensor; and the importance of the aforementioned pa-
rameters depends on the employed use-case. Another
issue is the placement strategy for single-element sensors
and sensor arrays. With the increase in the array size,
the sensing time and the overall power consumption also
increase. Furthermore, another challenge is the design
of sensing circuits having high spatial resolution. In
summary, the optimization of the spatial resolution, scan
time, sensitivity, and placement is important for haptic
sensors.

Haptic actuators can be of type cutaneous or kinaes-
thetic. The cutaneous type deals with the muscle or
force tension and the sense of the relative position of
the neighbouring body parts. On the other hand, the ki-
naesthetic type mainly deals with the touch related to the
skin, including vibration, pressure, pain and temperature.
In haptic feedback systems over wireless TI, it is crucial
to provide a feeling of touch to the user which is similar
to the feeling the user would receive in the real-world
context. One of the main current challenges is to design
a practical and lightweight haptic display, which have
the capabilities of both the cutaneous and kinaesthetic
feedback.

B. Requirements and Potential Enablers

Towards supporting the haptic communications in LTE-
A based cellular networks, authors in [6] identiﬁed the key
requirements of haptic communications from the perspective
of radio resource allocation and studied the radio resource allo-
cation problem in LTE-A based networks. Due to the presence
of a global control loop and the bidirectional nature, haptic
communication has unique requirements for radio resource
allocation in LTE-A based cellular networks in contrast to
the radio resource allocation for voice/video communications.
These unique requirements are listed in the following [6, 55].

1) Symmetric resource allocation in both the uplink and
the downlink is required due to the involvement of the
bidirectional ﬂow of feedback and command signals
between the master domain (haptic device end) and the
slave domain (Teleoperator end).

2) Radio resources in the conventional multimedia com-
munications are usually allocated independently in the
uplink and downlink. This independent resource alloca-
tion approach is not suitable for haptic communications
because of the involved coupling of uplink and downlink
resulted due to the bidirectional information exchange.
The QoS degradation in the forward path of haptic
communications directly affects the QoS of the reverse
path [40], thus resulting in the need of joint resource
allocation in both the uplink and downlink.

3) The requirement of bounded delay needs to be consid-
ered in the resource allocation problem in order to ensure
the stability of the global control loop.

4) It is essential to guarantee the minimum rate throughout

a complete haptic session.

In the following, we review the related works which dis-
cussed the issues and potential enablers of haptic communi-
cations.

Authors in [6] translated the aforementioned radio resource
requirements into a power and Resource Block (RB) alloca-
tion problem considering the constraints of the uplink and
downlink multiple access schemes. The formulated problem
was decomposed by using the optimal power control policy,
and then was transformed into a binary integer programming
problem for the RB allocation. Also, the authors employed
a low-complexity heuristic algorithm for joint scheduling in

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

13

both the uplink and downlink by considering the unique
requirements of haptic communications.

Future 5G and beyond networks are expected to support
haptic communications, leading to the concept of human-in-
the-loop mobile networks in contrast to the past wired human-
in-the-loop solutions [55]. However, to enable the real-time
haptic interaction over wireless networks, current wireless
technologies need to be improved to satisfy the stringent
communication requirements in terms of very low latency and
ultra-high reliability. In this regard, authors in [55] discussed
various architectural aspects and radio resource allocation
requirements of the human-in-the-loop mobile networks.

Radio resource slicing can be considered as one of the
promising solutions to provide ﬂexible resource allocation
in haptic communications over 5G and beyond networks.
However, most of the existing radio resource slicing solutions
are unable to deal with the varying trafﬁc demands and channel
conditions of highly dynamic wireless environments, where
each network slice follows different dynamics and requires an
independent optimal slicing period (the period after which the
slice-size needs to be recalculated) [56]. In order to achieve
the maximum utilization of the limited radio resources in these
environments, the slicing strategy should be as dynamic as
possible in contrast to the conventional static slice allocation.
In the above context, authors in [56] proposed a radio re-
source slicing framework, named as Hap-SliceR, which deﬁnes
the network-wide optimum radio resource allocation strategy
for haptic communications over 5G networks. The proposed
strategy ﬂexibly allocates the radio resources to different
slices while taking the dynamics and utility requirements of
different slices into account. A Reinforcement Learning (RL)
based technique was utilized which enables the learning entity
(responsible for slicing) to not only learn the size of each slice,
but update it dynamically based on the underlying require-
ments. Furthermore, a post-decision state learning approach
[95] was employed on the top of the RL approach to further
enhance the efﬁciency of the slicing strategy.

In order to accurately predict haptic properties and interact
with the world, humans usually combine visual predictions and
feedback from the physical interactions. In this regard, authors
in [57] proposed a method to classify surfaces with haptic
adjectives by utilizing both the physical and visual interaction
data and demonstrated that more accurate haptic classiﬁcation
can be obtained with both the visual and physical interaction
signals.

Haptic communication needs to deal with the rapid transfer
of a large amount of haptic data due to a short sampling
period and high frequency communication requirements. The
bilateral control in haptic communication usually involves the
following types of information ﬂow: bidirectional communi-
cation of angle, angular velocity, and torque [96]. With the
growing number of haptic devices, the limited capacity of the
communication channel becomes one crucial aspect to be ad-
dressed. In this regard, investigating suitable trafﬁc reduction
techniques is one of the important research issues. To address
this, authors in [58] recently proposed an impedance control
method for the trafﬁc reduction of haptic data by utilizing
the equivalency between the impedance ﬁeld and the standard

bilateral control. This equivalency was validated theoretically,
and via simulation and experimental results, it was shown that
the transmission of only the force information can provide
similar performance to that of the standard bilateral control.
Towards meeting the necessary QoS requirements of hap-
tic data transfer over the Internet, the considered transport
protocol should possess several qualitative features includ-
ing reliability, prioritization, congestion/ﬂow control, buffer
optimization, differential coding, packetization and synchro-
nization [97]. In this regard, authors in [59] discussed the
transmission requirements of the haptic data and the necessary
QoS for the haptic data with the objective of maximizing the
quality of experience for the haptic users. With the help of
experiments, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of haptic
data transfer over the Internet subject to some limitations in
terms of geographical distance and network conditions.

One of the crucial issues in the area of bilateral teleoperation
is the delay involved with the communication channel between
the master and slave operators [98], which may result in
performance degradation and system instability. This delay
based performance degradation is mainly related to the band-
width and throughput trade-offs in the NCSs. To fulﬁll the
requirements of stability and better precision, the NCSs usually
demand for much higher sampling frequencies than those
needed for the high performance communication network [99],
thus the need of two different Nyquist frequencies (i.e., high
speed sampling for the controller and low speed sampling for
the network) [60].

Haptic communications can be broadly classiﬁed into open-
loop and closed-loop haptic communications, which have very
different communications requirements [93]. The exchange of
kinesthetic information in bilateral teleoperation systems with
the kinesthetic feedback can be considered as an example
of open-loop haptic communications while haptic perceptual
systems such as surface haptics can be considered as a use-
case example of closed-loop haptic communications. The
closed-loop haptic communications system needs to meet strict
latency constraints due to the requirement of sending new force
or sensor readings immediately while the open-loop haptic
systems do not suffer from these stringent delay requirements
since they do not involve a global control loop.

C. Use Case Example: Teleoperation Systems

Authors in [5] provided a detailed survey of haptic com-
munications in the networked tele-operation systems over
the TI by considering the remote environments of low and
intermediate dynamics. They investigated the following three
main domains: (i) reliable and low-latency communication
network, (ii) intelligent data processing, and (iii) stability
control methods. In the following, we brieﬂy discuss some
aspects related to haptic communications over the teleopera-
tion systems.

A multi-modal teleoperation (telepresence and teleaction)
system, also called telephatic system, usually comprises three
main entities: (i) one human operator with a haptic interface
(master device), (ii) a communication channel, and (iii) one
teleoperator (slave actuator) [5]. The main objective of this

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

14

system is to provide human users with multimodal feed-
back including visual, auditory, and haptic feedback with
the continuous development in the involved hardware and
software. Depending on the involved communication delays
and interaction levels that an end-user may experience, tele-
operation systems in general can be categorized into direct
control and supervisory control. The direct control system
can be further divided into closed-loop with the negligible
delay and the time-delayed closed loop, while the supervisory
control can be either autonomously or semi-autonomously
controlled.

From the communication perspective,

there are mainly
the following two challenges for the effective design and
operation of teleoperation systems. The ﬁrst challenge is that
communicating kinesthetic information between the master
and slave ends in a teleoperation system requires a high packet
transmission rate of about 1000 or more haptic data packets
per second,
leading to an inefﬁcient data communication
due to the depletion of the network resources. To address
this issue, suitable haptic data reduction and compression
techniques for teleoperation systems need to be investigated.
The second challenge is that teleoperation systems are very
sensitive to the latency and data loss [100]. Furthermore,
authors in [40] analyzed the force-velocity control architecture
of a telepresence system for the positions of human system
interface and teleoperator with and without considering the
involved communication delay. They reported that even a small
amount of delay or packet loss rate can cause stability issues in
a bilateral teleoperation system, leading to the service quality
degradation.

In many areas of telepresence and teleaction systems in-
tele-manipulation in dangerous en-
cluding tele-education,
vironments, teleconferences, telerobotics, minimally invasive
surgery and on-orbit teleservicing, a realistic presentation of
the remote environment is crucial to enhance the performance
of haptic transmission as well as to guarantee the QoE to
the haptic user. One of the important approaches to enhance
the high quality interaction in immersive communication is
to employ haptic data reduction with the help of haptic data
compression. In principle, the compression of haptic signals
is different than the compression of audio and video signals
due to the strict stability and delay requirements. In this
regard, authors in [41] provided a comprehensive discussion
on a number of haptic data reduction methods including
perceptual deadband-based haptic data reduction, velocity-
adaptive perceptual deadband-based, signal-based predictive
coding, model-based predictive coding and event-based coding
of haptics.

IV. WIRELESS AUGMENTED AND VIRTUAL REALITY

The emerging Virtual Reality (VR) provides an immersive
environment for the user to interact with the world by means
of a head-mounted display while the Augmented Reality (AR)
enables the user to visualize the superimposing content over
the real world in mobile devices including smart phones and
laptops. These VR and AR applications demand for real-time
interactions and the ﬂow of massive information, and thus will

introduce new design challenges in future networks in terms
of improving several performance metrics such as network
throughput, delay performance and capacity [63].

Wireless VR applications need to concurrently support
ultra-high data-rate, ultra-high responsive speed and ultra-high
reliability [62]. AR and VR have a signiﬁcant number of
emerging applications such as high mobility using automotive,
high-capacity upload from the event venues, high-bandwidth
6 DoF experiences, and low-latency remote control, and the
TI [2]. However, today’s powerful VR prototypes are mainly
based on wired/cable connection since the high resolution
video at high frame-rates cannot be achieved using today’s
wireless technologies and a perfect user interface is still
lacking [42]. Also, current VR applications are mostly based
on wired connections with the limited actions that the user
can take and it
is very important to deploy VR services
in the wireless environment to have truely immersive VR
applications. However, there are several issues regarding the
transmission of VR services in a wireless environment, i.e.,
in terms of tracking accuracy, data-rate and latency [42]. To
address these issues, there are several research attempts in the
direction of realizing interconnected VR, which are reviewed
in the following.

The main objective of the VR is to create a digital real-
time experience that reﬂects the full resolution of the human
perception,
i.e., regenerating every photons that our eyes
observe, including small vibrations that our ears can detect, as
well as other cognitive aspects such as smell and touch. In this
regard, the authors in [42] highlighted the current and future
trends of VR systems towards reaching a fully interconnected
VR society, and discussed scientiﬁc challenges and the key
enablers for total interconnected VR systems.

Furthermore, the transfer of VR video streaming needs to
satisfy the following three main requirements: (i) ultra-high
data rate, (ii) ultra-high responsive speed, and (iii) ultra-high
transfer reliability, which are also called three Ultra-High
(3UH) requirements. The ﬁrst requirement of ultra-high data
rate arises from the 360◦ view-port and high-deﬁnition video
quality while the second requirement of ultra-high responsive
speed arises from the low motion-to-photon latency request
(normally 10-20 milliseconds). Similarly, the third requirement
necessitates the need of guaranteeing a satisfactory Quality of
Experience (QoE).

In the context of multiple VR users, one of the main
challenges is to concurrently support the maximum number
of VR users while guaranteeing their 3UH QoE, thus leading
to the need of designing efﬁcient scheduling techniques. In this
regard, authors in [62] proposed a multiuser MAC scheduling
scheme for the VR service in MIMO-OFDM based 5G sys-
tems, which comprises three main functions, namely: video
frame differentiation and delay-based weight calculation, link
adaptation with dynamic Block-Error-Rate (BLER) target and
the maximum aggregate delay-capacity utility based spatial-
frequency user selection.

With regard to supporting VR applications with cellular net-
works, authors in [61] studied the resource management prob-
lem for a small-cell based wireless network having wireless
VR users, and proposed a multi-attribute utility theory based

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

VR model by jointly taking account different VR metrics
including processing delay, tracking accuracy and transmission
delay. In the considered scenario, the small-cell BSs acting as
VR control centers gather the tracking information from the
VR users over wireless links in the uplink, and subsequently
send the 3D images and the associated audio information to
the VR users in the downlink.

Due to the need of real-time interactions and the ﬂow of
massive information in VR/AR applications, future networks
need to address several new challenges mainly in terms of
meeting the network capacity demand and delay performance.
In contrast to the transmission of the traditional video applica-
tions, VR/AR applications have very strict uplink/dowlink la-
tency requirements. For example, for the transmission of 360◦
video in a VR application, Motion-to-Photon (MTP) latency
should be within 20 milliseconds in order for the users not to
feel dizzy. Towards meeting these requirements of low latency
and reliable data transmission in VR/AR applications, authors
in [63] recently proposed to utilize an SDN architecture for
5G small-cell networks, and subsequently utilized a multi-path
cooperative route scheme for fast wireless transmissions to the
desired user from multiple edge data-centers.

Furthermore, authors in [64] carried out the performance
analysis of interconnected VR systems by utilizing a stochastic
geometry tool in a 3D urban ultra-dense scenario consisting of
densely deployed low-power nodes. Subsequently, a two-stage
cooperative transmissions scheme was proposed to mitigate the
harmful inter-cell interference in the considered ultra-dense
scenario, and the expressions for average VR data-rate and
latency probability were derived. The accuracy of the derived
expressions and the practicability of the proposed two-stage
cooperation scheme was demonstrated via numerical results.
Moreover, the generation of VR video requires the knowl-
edge of tracking information related to the interactions of the
VR users with the underlying VR environment. The tracking
delay as well as the tracking accuracy will signiﬁcantly impact
the generation and transmission of VR videos, thus degrading
the users’ QoE. The tracking delay is a crucial aspect to be
considered in VR video transmission in contrast to the conven-
tional static High Deﬁnition (HD) videos [61]. Furthermore,
compared to the HD video where only the video transmission
delay is the main concern, several parameters such as video
transmission delay, tracking information transmission delay
and the delay occurred in generating VR videos based on the
tracking information need to be jointly considered in VR video
applications.

The resulting immersive experiences from the wireless
VR/AR will facilitate the new way of communicating, working
and entertainment in the next IoT era. Mainly, there are four
types of VR Head Mounted Device (HMD): (i) PC VR (exam-
ples: Oculus Rift and HTC Vive), (ii) Console VR (example:
playstation VR), (iii) mobile VR (example: Samsung gean
VR, Google Daydream), and (iv) wireless all-in-one HMD
device (example: Intel Alloy) [101]. Currently, these devices
are heavy and large, and industries are investigating the ways
to make them lighter and portable. In most of today’s HMDs,
the main processing happens locally, and therefore, this raises
the portability and mobility issues. To address these issues,

authors in [101] proposed to carry out rendering either at
the cloud-servers or at the edge-servers in order to enable
the mobility and portability of the VR experiences. They also
reported on the advantages and disadvantages of rendering at
the cloud-servers, edge-servers and local devices.

In terms of emerging applications,

the VR is enabling
important use-cases in the ﬁeld of medical surgery via im-
mersive VR and human-computer interaction. Recent techno-
logical advances in imaging techniques for the visualization
of organs/tissues and minimally invasive instruments such as
endoscope are leading to the possibility of immersive VR in
medical surgery applications [65]. One of the main issues
in implementing VR in surgery applications is to integrate
various technologies to facilitate surgeon in exploring and
treating a target organ/tissue in a way that they were inside
the patient. In this regard, authors in [65] investigated a 3D
immersive VR-based endoscopic system to support minimally
invasive interventions and intra-body cavities, and validated
the signiﬁcance of the proposed method with the support from
the skilled surgeons.

Another emerging application of VR is rehabilitation treat-
ment in the clinical practice. In this regard, authors in [66]
proposed an immersive VR rehabilitation training system with
wearable haptics towards enhancing the engagement of child
patients with neuromotor impairments. Also, an experimental
rehabilitation session was conducted with children, who suf-
fered from celebral palsy and development dyspraxia, and a
performance comparison of children and adult control groups
was carried out.

A. Key Technical Challenges

The main technical challenges for interconnected wireless

VR [42] are brieﬂy discussed below.

1) Novel Information Theoretic Principles: The inves-
tigation of basic information theoretic principles such
as Shannon theory for the wireless VR scenarios is
one of the important future research directions. Under
this theme, different enablers such as coding design to
minimize the feedback delay, haptic code design for
VR systems, source compression under the imperfect
knowledge of input distribution, source coding with
the complete knowledge and compressed sensing with
imperfect structural knowledge, need to be investigated
for wireless VR scenarios.

2) Quality-Rate-Latency Trade-off: Another important
issue is to investigate the quality level per content
which maximizes the quality of immersive VR expe-
rience under the given network topology, storage and
communication constraints. Furthermore, ﬁnding the op-
timal payload size for a given content to maximize the
information transfer rate under the given latency and rate
constraints for the self-driving car scenario is another
interesting optimization problem.

3) Scalability and Heterogeneity: Another challenge is to
analyze the very large VR systems and networks having
diverse views and raw information.

4) Localization and Tracking Accuracy: The accuracy of
the existing localization and tracking techniques needs to

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

16

be enhanced to achieve a fully immersive VR experience
in different scenarios such as human eyes tracking and
object localization.

5) Energy-efﬁcient VR: To achieve the green VR, power
consumption in terms of communication, computing and
storage should be minimized as much as possible for a
given target VR user’s immersive experience.

6) In-Network versus In-VR Computation: Another is-
sue is to ﬁnd out which level of task/computation should
take place in the VR headset and which component on
the network-side depending on bandwidth-latency-cost-
reliability trade-offs.

7) Quantum Computing: The emerging quantum comput-
ing paradigm [102] can address different issues related to
computation in VR systems by exploiting entanglement
and superposition principles and also by bridging the
virtual and physical worlds.

8) Privacy Preservation: It is a crucial challenge to inves-
tigate intelligent mechanisms which can automatically
preserve privacy without providing burden on the user-
side/haptic devices.

B. Potential Enablers

The key enablers for the interconnected wireless VR include

the following [42].

1) Caching/Storage/Memory: Caching/storage in different
entities of the VR systems will have a crucial role since
it is not efﬁcient to access the content-server each time
the request arises. Various kinds of side knowledge such
as the user’s location, mobility patterns and social ties
can be exploited to make the decision on which contents
to cache and where to cache them.

2) Collaborative Local/Fog/Edge and Cloud Comput-
ing/Processing: Due to the huge computational capacity
and storage capacity available at the cloud, it becomes
highly beneﬁcial to process computationally demanding
tasks at the cloud-center. However, this cloud-side pro-
cessing is not suitable for the applications demanding
low-latency and high QoS [34]. On the other hand,
edge/fog computing at
the devices/aggregators/access
points can support the applications/services demanding
low-latency, location-awareness, high mobility and high
QoS [103]. In this regard, collaborative edge/cloud pro-
cessing [34], which can utilize the beneﬁts of both the
computing/processing paradigms, seems one promising
enabler for wireless VR applications.

3) Short-Range Wireless Communications: Relevant
contextual information can be shared among collocated
VR uses by means of M2M or Device-to-Device (D2D)
communications to address the network congestion is-
sue.

4) Context-Awareness and Analytics: The acquisition of
contextual information and the analysis of the acquired
information to extract the meaningful information, play
a crucial role in optimizing complex wireless networks
including wireless TI. The contextual information may
be in-device and in-network side information such as

user location, velocity, employed MAC schemes and
battery level.

5) User’s Behavioral Data and Social VR: Other aspects
to be analyzed towards enhancing the user’s QoE are
the user’s behavioral data and social interactions. For
example, novel solutions to address the issue of switch-
ing among multiple screens should be developed for
wireless VR applications by utilizing a common data-
driven platform.

V. AUTONOMOUS, INTELLIGENT AND COOPERATIVE
MOBILITY SYSTEMS

In this section, we provide some discussions on TI applica-
tions in vehicular communications and unmanned autonomous
systems including automotive with V2X communications, co-
operative automated driving, Internet of drones and mobile
AR/VR.

1) Automotive with V2X Communications: V2V communi-
cation is considered as one of the enabling technologies for
low-latency communications among vehicles [104]. However,
a pure ad-hoc network architecture may not achieve the desired
latency requirement due to scalability issues, and thus Vehicle-
to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication is needed not only to
improve the communication reliability, but also to reduce
the reaction time of the vehicles. In this regard, authors in
[68] proposed a time dynamic optimization approach to deal
with the highly dynamic environment of vehicular networks
(involving both the V2V and V2I links) by employing a vir-
tualization technique. Two important rules to establish virtual
heterogeneous networks include the complete isolation among
different virtual networks and services and additional control
signalling overhead of the proposed scheme. The proposed
virtualization approach in [68] studied the optimization of
the spectrum resources by considering the constraints on
the
the network switching rate. Via the analytical results,
tradeoff between the network switching rate and the latency
performance was analyzed.

The safety critical services play a crucial role in enhancing
the driving experience via several emerging applications. How-
ever, the main challenge in the vehicular networks is to achieve
the desired low latency and high reliability of V2X services.
Furthermore, since the existing LTE-based vehicular networks
are based on the orthogonal multiple access technique and do
not fully utilize the limited frequency resources, this may lead
to the problem of data congestion and lower access efﬁciency
in dense vehicular networks. In this direction, authors in
[69] proposed a NOMA-based hybrid centralized/decentralized
scheme towards reducing the access collision and enhancing
the reliability of the network.

Furthermore, the V2I and V2I communications are impor-
tant to future cars for collaborative autonomous driving and
in-car entertainments [105]. In these applications, there arises
a need of transferring huge amount of information with a very
low latency and the desired latency depends on the dynamics
of the surrounding environments. Moreover, very high quality
of audio and video information transfer is required in arti-
ﬁcial intelligence-assisted collaborative autonomous driving.

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

17

In addition, in remote driving applications, the exchange of
haptic information requires very high degrees of freedom (in
the order of several tens to hundreds). The achievable latency
in the existing V2V and V2I links is more than 10 ms, and
this is not acceptable for handling autonomous vehicle trafﬁc
[106, 107].

Future V2V and V2I communications require very reliable
connectivity to handle life-critical situations and the sensing
data needs to be communicated to the drivers in real-time
to make reliable and timely decisions, thus leading to ultra-
low latency requirements and automotive high speed networks.
In this direction, some of the recent trends for supporting
drivers in life-critical conditions include high-resolution cam-
eras and sensors having high data-rate volume. Furthermore,
automotive audio-video bridging and time sensitive networks
are in the process of standardization [10]. Also, emerging
haptic applications in the automotive sector include the remote
driving support of trucks, shuttles and road machines in the
regions where it is difﬁcult to maintain or serve, and where
remote driving requires immediate feedback in order to make
reliable decisions in life-threatening cases.

2) Cooperative Automated Driving: One promising appli-
cation scenario of the TI is the cooperative automated driving,
which is composed of two fundamental domains, i.e., vehicular
networking and automated driving. In this TI application, one
of the crucial scenarios is cooperative adaptive cruise con-
trol or platooning since it demands for strict communication
requirements in terms of high reliability and low latency, in
order to ensure the safety gap of less than 5 m between the
cars. The message rates in the order of about 10 kHz is needed
for large networks. This is beyond the capacities of existing
vehicular networking technologies under the critical network
congestion and unreliable wireless links. In this regard, authors
in [70] discussed the future opportunities of utilizing TI
principles by integrating multidisciplinary technologies from
the mechanical engineering, control theory and communication
protocol design. Furthermore, future research challenges for
the realization of cooperative automated driving in terms of
scalability and dependability, security and privacy, and public
acceptance, have also been discussed.

The problem of scalability needs to be addressed from the
perspective of resource allocation rather than the congestion
resolution approach since this TI application may not be
able to wait for the congestion to be resolved. For ensuring
the full dependability of the automated driving system, the
underlying TI communications need to be completely coordi-
nated by means of different physical communication channels
(cellular, short-range radio techniques, mmWave and visible
light communications) and they should be as uncorrelated as
possible. Moreover, ensuring security is a critical issue since it
is directly related to the public safety. From the communication
perspective, there may occur two major types of attacks in the
TI, namely, tampering of the onboard unit and exploiting radio
for sending fake information but authenticated messages [70].
The main challenge in both of these attack scenarios is to have
the timely transmission of reliable information required for
cooperation. To address this, multiple communications links
should be utilized in parallel for redundant information, and

also the data should be combined and checked for consistency
before feeding to the control algorithms.

Cooperative automated driving envisions the collaborative
operation of a number of self-driving vehicles. However,
most of the self-driving vehicles are based on single-vehicle
control/sensing operations; moreover, the perception ﬁeld of
the vehicle is limited to the local coverage of onboard sensors.
In order to concurrently ensure the safety and trafﬁc efﬁciency,
single-vehicle based perception/control needs to be completely
transformed to multi-vehicle perception/control. In this regard,
TI can act as a potential paradigm by enabling fast and reliable
transfer of sensor data along with the haptic information
related to driving trajectories among the vehicles via V2V/V2I
or vehicle-to-any (V2X) communications. This will subse-
quently enable the functionalities of cooperative perception
and manuevering [71] for cooperative driving applications.
Also, TI can enable the extension of the sensing range of
the vehicle as well as the time horizon for the prediction of
underlying situations for ensuring the safety of autonomous
vehicles.

Platooning is considered as a potential approach to enhance
the trafﬁc ﬂow efﬁciency and road trafﬁc safety and it needs
to deal with the strict communication requirements in terms of
update frequency and reliability. In this regard, authors in [67]
exploited different communication strategies by considering
the synchronized communication, transmit power adaptation
and the requirements of the controller. Through simulation
results, the authors demonstrated the potential of the com-
bination of synchronized communication slots with transmit
power adaptation for cooperative driving applications.

3) Internet of Drones: Another promising application of TI
is Internet of drones. Due to recent advances in control and
communication technologies, future unmanned aerial vehicles,
i.e., drones are expected to extensively deliver packages or
emergency items such as medicine/medical equipment for
patients and other urgent components. In this regard, big
industrial players including Google, Amazon and DHL have
already tested the delivery feasibility via drones [10]. However,
during these tests, only a few number of drones has been
utilized, but the management of trafﬁc for delivery drones
becomes highly essential in the future by considering a huge
number of drones owned by several companies. In addition,
low-latency communication and dynamic route selection are
crucial to avoid drone collisions and any damages underneath.
In this regard, TI could be a promising paradigm for enabling
ultra-high reliability, ultra-low latency and overall safety of
future drone delivery systems. In addition to the transmission
of real-time location, audio and video data, haptic (tactile and
kinaesthetic) information can be transmitted over the under-
lying communication network to enhance the performance of
future drones/UAVs.

4) Mobile AR/VR: VR has been considered as an effec-
tive tool to reduce the procedural pain and psychological in
the patients undergoing surgery with its analgesic effects of
reducing respiration rate, heart rate, blood pressure and oral
secretion. With the recent advances in cheaper, lightweight,
and easy-to-use mobile technologies, there has been increasing
interest in employing VR technologies in tele-health and home

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

18

health-care scenarios, leading to the concept of mobile VR
[76]. Besides validating the palliative effects of VR systems
in clinical scenarios, there has been studies to analyze the
efﬁcacy of mobile phones in delivering VR services to the
patients [76, 108]. Although not as effective like the costly
wired HMDs, mobile devices are shown to mitigate the pain-
level and psychological indicators such as heart rate [109].
Such mobile VR approach can enable the paradigm shift of
moving palliative, rehabilitative and preventive care at the
remote distances from the patients’ homes and clinics.

Besides two dominant applications of mobile AR including
hardware-based mobile AR and app-based mobile AR, another
promising mobile AR applications is web AR. The main draw-
backs of hardware-based mobile AR are its implementation
cost and less ﬂexibility. On the other hand, app-based AR
applications are not suitable for a cross-platform deployment
since they require extra downloading and installation in ad-
vance. In contrast, web AR is capable of providing pervasive
mobile AR experience due to cross-platform service provision-
ing and the lightweight features of the web [77]. However, for
the implementation of web AR in practical scenarios, several
challenges exist in terms of energy efﬁciency, computational
efﬁciency and networking. To enhance the performance of web
AR applications, computational ofﬂoading to the cloud could
be an advantageous option, but this may introduce additional
communication delay, which may impact the user’s experience.
The spectrum efﬁciency and latency targets by the upcoming
B5G networks as well as the emerging technologies including
network slicing, D2D communications and multi-access edge
computing, can be promising enablers for the deployment of
web AR.

VI. ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR WIRELESS TACTILE
INTERNET

A. Review of Main Challenges

In Table IV, we have highlighted the key research chal-
lenges to be addressed for the practical realization of TI in
future wireless networks across various application domains
of TI. The main challenges concerning the connectivity issues
include achieving ultra-low latency of < 1 ms, ultra-high reli-
ability of > 99.99%, high data-rate for some TI applications in
the order of Gbps to Tbps and very high backhaul bandwidth.
In addition to the above connectivity challenges (as described
earlier in Section III),
the haptic domain presents several
other challenges including: (1) the selection of suitable haptic
codecs to capture the remote interactions, (2) the investigation
of suitable coordination mechanisms and interfaces for H2M
communications and suitable modalities for interactions, en-
suring the stability of haptic control loop, (3) the investigation
of suitable area-based or distributed sensing methods, (4) the
investigation of methods for effective multiplexing of multi-
model (haptic, audio and visual) sensory information, and (5)
the design of novel performance metrics to characterize the
system performance.

In the domain of Wireless Extended Reality (XR), i.e.,
the additional challenges on top of the
wireless AR/VR,
above mentioned connectivity challenges include balancing

the quality-rate-latency trade-off, dealing with the scalability
and heterogeneity, enhancing the localization and tracking
efﬁciency, selecting between in-VR and in-network compu-
tation and investigating novel information theoretic principles
to characterize the wireless XR systems. Furthermore, in the
domain of autonomous, intelligent and cooperative mobility
the main challenges
systems, as highlighted in Table IV,
include ensuring low latency and high reliability of V2X
services, dynamic route selection for the drones with low-
latency, and efﬁcient trafﬁc management for Internet of drones.
Also, suitable Machine Learning (ML)/Artiﬁcial Interference
(AI) techniques for the prediction of movement/action to com-
pensate for the physical limitations of remote latency, should
be investigated. In the following, we provide some discussions
on some of these challenges, along with the corresponding
references.

Providing stringent QoS for TI services in the upcom-
ing 5G and beyond wireless networks is a crucial research
challenge. To ensure the ultra-low round-trip latency and
ultra-high reliability for each short packet in TI application
scenarios, the main delay components including transmission
delay, processing delay and queueing delay should be bounded
with a small violation probability [106]. These delays can be
minimized at some level by using a short transmission frame
structure, a short TTI and short codes including polar codes.
Furthermore, the channel access delay at the access network
and the latency involved in the backbone network could be
minimized by utilizing novel access schemes and by adapting
the network architecture, respectively.

Another issue is to provide the desired QoS to the TI
services without signiﬁcantly degrading the spectral efﬁciency
and energy efﬁciency requirements of 5G and beyond networks
[110]. However, resource allocation needs to be conservative
(for example, channel inversion power allocation with un-
bounded power) to meet the strict delay requirements, leading
to the waste of useful energy and degradation in energy
efﬁciency. Although there are some attempts in enhancing the
energy efﬁciency under the delay bound violation probability
and queueing delay constraints [111, 112] in different system
settings, designing energy-efﬁcient resource allocation tech-
niques for TI applications under strict QoS constraints of TI
services is challenging.

Furthermore, most of the existing wireless systems are
designed to support the Human-Type Communications (HTC)
trafﬁc and may not be efﬁcient to handle a massive number of
short data packets generated from IoT devices in TI applica-
tions. In contrast to the transmission of long packets, short data
packet transmission differs mainly in the following two ways
[35, 113]. First, the assumption in the existing transmission
techniques is that the size of the control information (metadata)
is negligible with regard to the size of the information payload.
Nevertheless, for the case of short packet transmission, the
metadata size becomes no longer negligible and the above
assumption does not hold, thus resulting in the need of highly
efﬁcient encoding schemes. Secondly, for the case of long
packets, the thermal noise and channel distortions average
out due to the law of large numbers and it is feasible to
design channel codes which can enable the reconstruction of

the information payload with a high probability, however, this
averaging does not apply for the case of short packets and
the classical law of large numbers does not hold for IoT/TI
applications [35], resulting in the need of new information
theoretic principles.

Moreover, due to challenging requirements (mainly due
to the strict requirement of 1 ms round-trip latency), many
existing congestion control mechanisms, higher layer and link
layer based retransmission techniques for enhancing the com-
munication reliability may not be applicable in TI applications.
In order to achieve low latency required for TI applications, it
is crucial to reduce the time-consuming signalling caused by
different factors such as data transfer errors or loss detection
and correction, and congestion control [7, 114]. Moreover,
towards enabling the real-time human-machine interaction in
TI applications, the following two issues are critical in addition
to enhancing the speed of haptic data transmission [13]: (i)
the reaction time of the haptic system should ﬁt within the
time window deﬁned by the reaction time of the involved
human sense, and (ii) the time-lag of the feedback for different
senses needs to be imperceptible for the scenarios where
multiple senses (audio, visual, haptic) are being involved in
an interaction.

Although recent advances in network architecture/topology,
protocols and device hardware can reduce the end-to-end
delays in a communication network to some extent,
the
achievable delay is limited by the ﬁnite speed of light since
it provides an upper bound for the maximum range of tactile
communications. For example, the maximum distance between
the steering/control server from the tactile interaction point
is limited to 150 km as the light speed is 300 km/ms [4].
To address this limitation, signiﬁcant innovations are needed
in the existing technologies and infrastructure. One approach
to overcome this fundamental limitation caused by the ﬁnite
speed of light could be to employ suitable ML techniques to
incorporate some intelligence at the edge-network in a way
that a similar action can be autonomously taken while the
actual action is on its way from the network-side [54].

The IEEE P1918.1 Working Group on the TI has set the
following requirements for a tele-operation scenario [93]: (i)
At least 99.9% of network reliability for the haptic, audio
and video channels, (ii) The latency for high dynamic en-
vironments should be between 1 and 10 ms for the haptic
channel and between 10 and 20 ms for the audio and video
channels, while for the medium or low dynamic environments,
the latency requirement ranges between 10 and 100 ms for the
kinesthetics or 100 and 1000 ms for tactile devices and 30-
40 ms for the video channels and 50-150 ms for the audio
channels, respectively, and (iv) The required network band-
width for the haptic control and feedback channel is on the
order of 100 − 500 packets per second without employing any
compression techniques, and 1000 − 4000 packets per second
with compression, with 2-48 bytes packet size depending on
the number of DoFs of the teleoperator. Also, depending on
the features of the microphones, cameras, display devices and
speakers, the audio and video channels between the operator
and teleoperator require a bandwidth of about 5 − 512 kb/s
and 1 − 100 Mb/s, respectively.

In addition, wireless VR technologies should be able to
make an efﬁcient transfer of VR video streaming by satisfying
the following three UH requirements: (i) ultra-high data rate,
(ii) ultra-high responsive speed, and (iii) ultra-high transfer
reliability. The main difference between the scenarios having
a single VR client and multiple VR clients is on the inter-
user effects on the parallel
transfer in different domains
including spatial, temporal and frequency [62]. In this regard,
authors in [62] presented the design and optimization of a
multi-user MAC scheduling technique for multiple wireless
VR scenarios, with the objective of maximizing the number
of concurrent VR clients while guaranteeing three UH QoS
requirements. The proposed scheme is based on the following
functions: (i) video frame differentiation and delay-based
weight calculation, (ii) spatial-frequency user selection based
on aggregate delay-capacity utility, and (iii) link adaptation
it
with the dynamic BLER target. Via numerical results,
has been demonstrated that the proposed technique increases

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

20

the maximum number of concurrently served VR users by
about 31.6%, which is higher than the rate produced by
the conventional method relying on the ﬁxed BLER target-
based link adaptation and the maximum-sum-capacity-based
scheduling.

B. Enabling Technologies

In Table V, we present the key enabling techniques towards
supporting TI applications in 5G and beyond networks along
with the underlying sub-methods. In the following, we discuss
these enabling technologies along with a review of the related
references.

1) Physical and MAC Layer Solutions: In this subsection,
we discuss various physical and MAC layer solutions towards
the efﬁcient management of resources, latency minimization
and reliability enhancement for TI applications.
1. Dynamic Resource Allocation Techniques: Authors in
[110] studied the mechanisms to maximize the spectral ef-
ﬁciency and energy efﬁciency for TI applications under the
constraint of QoS by taking the transmission delay and queue-
ing delay into account. It was shown that the queueing delay
violation probability derived from the effective bandwidth can
be utilized for Poisson arrival process and for more burstier
arrival processes than the Poisson process in the applications
demanding ultra-low latency. Also, Queue State Information
(QSI) and CSI dependent resource allocation policies were
proposed to avoid energy wastage caused by the conservative
design of loose upper bound of the queueing delay violation
probability.

The incorporation of tactile data in a typical 5G and
beyond wireless network makes the system implementation
challenging due to different delay requirements of the TI data
than those of the traditional data [39]. Also, TI with the 1 ms
latency can highly revolutionize the mobility sector in various
applications including the safety of pedestrians, platooning of
the vehicles, and remote driving [4]. In the mobility related
applications, the current achievable delay with the V2V and
the V2I is still more than 10 ms and this is not sufﬁcient to
support the autonomous vehicles trafﬁc. Therefore, it is crucial
to optimize the delay in TI applications including autonomous
vehicles and remote driving.

Authors in [115] studied the problem of cross-layer opti-
mization by considering the error probability, the transmission
delay and the statistical queueing delay to ensure the QoS
requirements of ultra-low end-to-end latency and ultra-high
reliability in a TI system. By considering the dependency of
queueing delay violation probability, packet dropping proba-
bility and packet error probability on the transmission resource
and the policy, a joint optimization of the above three parame-
ters was considered towards minimizing the transmit power of
the BS. Via simulation results, it was shown that the optimized
probabilities are in the same order of magnitude and all these
factors need to be considered in the design of TI systems. Also,
authors in [107] considered a resource allocation problem
with the objective of maximizing the uplink sum-rate of the
conventional data while fulﬁlling the delay requirements of
the tactile data in an SCMA-based system model consisting
of both the tactile and conventional data.

Furthermore, investigating the potential of LTE-A based
cellular networks for TI applications may provide signiﬁcant
insights towards the deployment of TI applications in the
existing cellular networks. In this regard, authors in [6] inves-
tigated the radio resource allocation problem to support haptic
communications in the LTE-A based cellular networks by
taking the requirements for radio resource allocation in haptic
communications along with the constraints of downlink and
uplink multiple access techniques. To reduce the complexity of
the optimization problem, an optimal power control policy was
applied for the resource block allocation by ﬁrst decomposing
the problem and then transforming it
to a binary integer
programming.

it was shown that

Moreover, the authors in [116] presented three different
coordinated multi-cell resource allocation techniques including
narrowband muting, a single frequency network and macro-
diversity with soft combining for 5G URLLC scenarios in
indoor environment. Via system-level simulation
a typical
the inter-cell coordination is a
results,
promising approach to enhance the transmission reliability
without causing longer delays as in the case of retransmissions.
In addition, authors in [117] investigated the joint uplink
and downlink resource allocation problem to minimize the
total bandwidth under the strict constraints of end-to-end
delay and packet loss probability. A statistical multiplexing
queueing mode was employed to minimize the desired packet
rate for guaranteeing the queueing delay at the BSs’ buffers.
Furthermore, a joint optimization of downlink and uplink
transmissions delays, queueing delay and bandwidth alloca-
tion, were performed to minimize the total bandwidth required
to ensure the desired end-to-end delay and overall reliability.
This joint optimization problem was decomposed in two steps
with the ﬁrst step considering the optimization of bandwidth
with the given packet loss and delay components, and the
second step dealing with the optimization of downlink and
uplink transmission delays and queueing delay for the given
end-to-end delay requirement. Via the presented analytical and
numerical results, it was shown that there exists a tradeoff
between the downlink and uplink bandwidth, and the opti-
mization of delay components leads to the saving of almost
half of the total bandwidth as compared to the scenario which
does not consider the optimization of delays.

Although audio/visual information provides the feeling of
being present in the remote environment, only the exchange of
haptic information (force, motion, texture and vibration) can
provide the real immersion into the remote scenarios. This re-
mote operation along with the exchange of haptic information
can enable the formation of human-in-the-loop networks. The
emerging 5G-enabled TI is expected to transform the tradi-
tional human-in-the-loop networks to the human-in-the-loop
mobile networks by supporting haptic communications over
the 5G networks. In this regard, authors in [55] identiﬁed the
main architectural features of the human-in-the-loop mobile
networks and the key requirements of haptic communications
from the perspective of radio resource allocation. Also, in
contrast to the traditional multimedia communications where
uplink and downlink sessions are independent, uplink and
downlink sessions in haptic communications are coupled due

to the involved bidirectional haptic information exchange, and
the fact that the degradation of QoS in one direction also
impacts the QoS in the reverse direction. In this regard, authors
in [55] studied two distinct types of joint resource allocation
problems related to symmetric and perceptual coding scenarios
in haptic communications.

The TI aims to drastically revolutionize various aspects of
our daily life via new applications and services. However, it
is crucial to carefully evolve the underlying communication
infrastructure to support the TI applications requiring ultra-
high reliability, ultra-low latency and carrier-grade (ulra-high)
reliability. To enable the real-time haptic communications in
TI applications, it is important to keep the end-to-end latency
(i.e., system response time) in the order of 1 ms [4]. The
contributing factors for this end-to-end latency can be divided
into three main categories [39, 119]: (i) user interface (≈ 300
µs), (ii) radio interface (≈ 200 µs), and (iii) end-to-end latency
between the wireless access point/BS and the steering/control
server (≈ 500 µs).

While considering the aforementioned latency contributing
factors, it is also important to investigate novel techniques
which can minimize the end-to-end latency in the link between
the BS/access point and the control/steering server. In this
regard, optical ﬁber technology seems to be a promising solu-
tion, but needs to consider the involved delays for switching,
signal processing and protocol handling. Also, the distance
between the edge TI BS/access point and control/steering
server is limited to only a few kilometers [39] and it
is
important to investigate novel Local Area Network (LAN)
technologies which can support the reliable transfer of sen-
sor/steering/control information with very low latency in addi-
tion to the conventional high-bandwidth applications/services.
However, existing LAN technologies based on copper or/and
multimode ﬁber are not sufﬁcient to handle these heteroge-

neous types of trafﬁc with different bandwidth demands and
QoS requirements.

In the above context, the Passive Optical Local Area (POL)
technology has emerged as a promising solution to address
the heterogeneous requirements of future LANs since it can
concurrently support multiple services via time-division mul-
tiplexing by utilizing the Gigabit or Ethernet passive optical
network technology [118]. Towards supporting TI trafﬁc, time
division multiplexing-based POL technology can be extended
to time and wavelength division multiplexing-based POL. In
this regard, authors in [119] examined the effectiveness of
the time and wavelength division multiplexing-based POL by
employing a TI-enabled dynamic bandwidth and wavelength
allocation algorithm towards concurrently supporting the TI
trafﬁc and the traditional healthcare trafﬁc. The proposed
algorithm estimates the average bandwidth of the TI and
non-TI bandwidth at each integrated wireless access point or
optical network terminal and uses prediction mechanisms at
the central ofﬁce in order to predict and allocated wavelengths
and bandwidth to the accumulated trafﬁc. Also, the number of
active wavelengths is dynamically varied to avoid the network
congestion while fulﬁlling the end-to-end latency constraints.
2. Advanced Signal Processing Techniques: The mission
critical real-time applications over the TI such as tele-surgery
demands for both ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements.
The support for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications
is considered as one of the crucial requirements of the upcom-
ing 5G and beyond wireless networks. In this regard, authors in
[120] investigated the utilization of massive MIMO technology
for delivering URLLC in bilateral tele-operation systems as an
integral component of the TI.

For the CSI acquisition in wireless communications sys-
tems, two types of training strategies are being utilized before

wireless networks.

which the BS transmits pilot signals to the user, which then
estimates the downlink CSI and feeds back to the BS, and (ii)
uplink channel training strategy- in which the BS estimates
the uplink CSI based on the pilot signals transmitted by the
user and the corresponding downlink CSI is learnt based on
the channel reciprocity. Although these techniques have been
widely used in various conventional wireless systems, their
performance degrades in wireless systems, which need to sup-
port short packets transmitted by the machine-type devices. In
this regard, authors in [121] recently analyzed the performance
of two training strategies by considering ﬁnite block-length
constraints in short-packet transmissions, and derived closed-
form expressions for the lower bounds on the achievable data-
rates of these schemes. Furthermore, an approximate analytical
expression for minimum channel reciprocity coefﬁcient has
been derived, and it has been shown that
this coefﬁcient
decreases with the decrease in the block-length and with
the increase in the number of transmit antennas. This result
indicates that uplink channel training is more beneﬁcial in
short packet transmission with multiple transmit antennas.

Regarding the performance of short packet transmissions in
Rayleigh block-fading channels, authors in [154] investigated
the performance tradeoffs among the key metrics including
latency, throughput and reliability by considering a multiple
antennas scenario. Also, authors derived the ﬁnite block-length
bounds on the maximum achievable coding rate over a MIMO
Rayleigh block-fading channel without considering the prior
knowledge of the CSI at the transmitter and receiver. The
presented numerical results reveal that the conventional in-
ﬁnite block-length performance metrics including the ergodic
capacity and outage do not provide an accurate estimate of the
maximum coding rate and they fail to characterize the tradeoff
among throughput, latency, reliability and channel estimation
overhead.

As a typical example of URLLC applications, factory

automation can be considered, which demands for several
new wireless technologies to enable discrete manufacturing,
process automation and efﬁcient production. It is very chal-
lenging to meet the demanding requirements of industrial
automation in terms of ultra-high reliability and ultra-low
latency [45]. In order to analyze the performance of such
industrial wireless networks, authors in [155] deﬁned a new
performance metric (called QoS-constrained area spectral ef-
ﬁciency) by considering both the end-to-end delay and the
reliability constraints into account. Subsequently, the authors
solved an optimization problem to maximize the above metric
with the power allocation by considering the constraints on
the BS total power and QoS.

3. Transmission and Link Adaptation Schemes: Ensuring
URLLC between the remote device and the local operator is
one of the crucial challenges in TI applications. The trafﬁc
of TI applications is predicted to be bursty [132] and most
existing works have not considered this burstiness aspect into
account, thus resulting in either an underestimation of latency
and packet loss probability in high trafﬁc state or a sacriﬁce
of the resource usage efﬁciency due to conservative resource
reservation. To this end, authors in [122] employed a Neyman-
Pearson method to classify the packet arrival process into
low and high trafﬁc states, and then optimized the reserved
bandwidth for these categories towards guaranteeing reliability
and latency requirements. Via numerical results, the authors
demonstrated that the proposed method being aware of the
trafﬁc states can save a huge amount of bandwidth as com-
pared to the conventional case which is not aware of the trafﬁc
states. Also, the resulting bandwidth saving increases with the
burstiness of trafﬁc.

Furthermore, authors in [123] considered the problem of de-
signing the uplink transmission for TI scenarios, and analyzed
the impact of spatial diversity and frequency diversity towards
guaranteeing the transmission reliability. In this direction,
a two-state transmission model was proposed based on the
achievable rate with ﬁnite block-length channel codes. Also,
by considering the system set-up, where multiple sub-channels
were assigned to a device and each device selecting one
sub-channel, various parameters such as the number of sub-
channels, sub-channel bandwidth and the channel selection
threshold, were optimized to ensure the transmission reliabil-
ity.

In conventional sensor networks having the assumption of
long packets and high duty cycles, various coding schemes
such as Bose-ChaudhuriHoccquenghem (BCH), low-density
parity check, and convolutional codes can be utilized to
enhance the energy efﬁciency. However, in many IoT sensory
applications, the data packet size is very small and the duty
cycle is also very low,
therefore achieving higher energy
efﬁciency becomes difﬁcult due to various issues such as small
coding gain, time synchronization and phase coherency. Due to
low duty cycle, it becomes challenging to maintain time syn-
chronization, and the required overhead can be prohibitively
huge. Also, the resulted coding gain is smaller due to the
short packet length. In this regard, authors in [124] studied
the tradeoff between energy and bandwidth efﬁciency for short
packet transmission in non-coherent transmission systems. Via

23

numerical results, the authors showed that 16-ary or 32-ary
orthogonal schemes are suitable candidate methods for short-
packet transmission in wireless sensor networks. Also, the
convolutional coding scheme was found to be a good candidate
solution due to its simplicity, higher energy efﬁciency and
robustness against practical imperfections including estimation
errors.

With regard to low-latency and reliability requirements
of 5G systems, there arises a fundamental tradeoff between
latency and robustness of the system. For example, while
employing the Out-Of-Band (OOB) emission techniques such
as transmit windowing in OFDM-based systems, the OOB
emission is suppressed, but on the other hand, the system
becomes susceptible to channel-induced inter-symbol interfer-
ence and inter-carrier interference. In this regard, authors in
[125] proposed to replace the widely-used symmetric window
by an asymmetric window to improve the aforementioned
latency-robustness tradeoff in LTE-based systems.

One of the promising methods to enable low end-to-end
latency in TI applications is to employ short frame structures,
but the employed ﬁnite block-length channel codes will result
in transmission errors. This effect should be considered while
satisfying the high reliability requirement. In this regard,
authors in [156] studied cross-layer transmission optimization
for TI applications by taking account of both the transmission
delay and queueing delay in the end-to-end delay and different
packet loss/error probabilities for the reliability. Mainly, a
proactive packet dropping mechanism was proposed to satisfy
the QoS requirement with the ﬁnite transmit power, and
three different probabilities, namely, packet error probability,
queueing delay violation probability, and packet dropping
probability, were optimized to obtain the transmission and
packet dropping policies for TI applications. Via numerical
results,
the aforementioned
probabilities are of the same order, and therefore, they all
need to be considered equally while designing the transmission
policy.

it has been illustrated that all

Traditional industrial automation systems are mainly based
on wired communications, i.e., they use Fieldbus and Ethernet-
based solutions. However, these wired solutions are expensive
and cumbersome, and there is a need of replacing them with
wireless alternatives. In the context of mission-critical com-
munications for factory automation, providing ultra-reliable
and low-latency communications is a crucial challenge. To
this end, authors in [157] proposed a pilot-assisted variable
rate URLLC method for the downlink of a factory automation
network by considering a time-varying fading channel, and
they demonstrated the signiﬁcance of their proposed scheme
(i) in extending the spectral efﬁciency range as compared to the
schemes with the equal-rate transmission, and (ii) in providing
robust ultra-reliability for a wide range of data payload sizes.
In addition to emerging 5G technologies, it is important to
utilize the IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) technology for achieving the
low-latency communications in TI applications. In this regard,
authors in [85] studied the feasibility of using Wi-Fi in TI
applications, and highlighted the potential of macro-diversity
schemes for low-latency one-to-many communications via
concurrent transmissions (C-Tx). More speciﬁcally, the authors

analyzed the practical feasibility of using concurrent trans-
missions with IEEE 802.11 for both the DSSS and OFDM
schemes. Also, the effect of limiting factors caused due to
imperfect synchronization including concurrent carrier fre-
quency offset, concurrent phase offset and concurrent timing
offset has been investigated. The employed C-Tx ﬂooding
scheme in [85] exploits the macro-diversity with the spatially
distributed antenna arrays formed by combining the antennas
of numerous devices to enable communications in the same
time-frequency channel. This C-Tx ﬂooding scheme provides
several advantages including low-latency communications, re-
duction of overall network load/ congestion, lightweight oper-
ation, improved coverage and implicit time synchronization.
Another important aspect in short burst and low-latency
communications is to design suitable physical layer wave-
forms. In this regard, authors in [126] compared three can-
didate multi-carrier waveforms for the air-interface of 5G sys-
tems, namely, ﬁltered Cyclic Preﬁx (CP)-OFDM, Filter Bank
Multi-Carier (FBMC), and Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier
(UFMC). The time-frequency efﬁciency of these techniques
was analyzed by considering very small burst transmissions
and with very tight latency constraints. Via numerical results,
it has been shown in [126] that the UFMC is the best choice
in the short-packet and low-latency communications scenarios,
especially in MTC and TI applications. Although the FBMC
is efﬁcient with long sequence transmissions, it suffers from
the high time domain overheads and is subject to a signiﬁcant
performance degradation with short bursts/frames.

4. Multiple Access and Scheduling Techniques: One of
the important QoS criteria for the transfer of tactile informa-
tion such as touch and actuation related information is latency,
since they are very sensitive to the delay. In this regard, authors
in [127] considered a scenario having tactile body-worn de-
vices connected via an IEEE 802.11 network, and analyzed the
wireless communication latency involved while transmitting
from these tactile devices to the access point by considering
a Hybrid Coordination Function Controlled Channel Access
(HCCA) MAC protocol. Furthermore, a theoretical expression
for the average latency was derived by applying queueing
theory.

In contrast

to the existing LTE/LTE-A based wireless
networks, future wireless networks need to be designed to
support emerging new use-cases which demand for ultra-high
reliability and ultra-low latency. In this regard, authors in [128]
investigated various design aspects of URLLC by considering
factory automation as a use-case scenario. They showed that
with the appropriate selection of coding, modulation, diver-
sity technique and frequency/time resources, it is possible
to have a fair balanced design of both the downlink and
uplink control channels. Furthermore, by considering a similar
factory automation example, authors in [128] investigated the
feasibility of utilizing wireless communications for URLLC
applications with some key design choices, and they showed
the possibility of obtaining very low error rates and laten-
cies over a wireless channel even in the presence of a fast
fading channel, interference, antenna correlation and channel
estimation errors. Also, it has been demonstrated via numerical
results that promising enablers for high reliability and low

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

latency are diversity and short transmission intervals without
retransmissions, respectively.

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has been con-
sidered as one of the promising candidate techniques to
address the scalability issue in handling the massive number
of machine-type devices with short packets [129]. To this
end, a trade-off among transmission delay, transmission rate
and decoding error probability has been analyzed in two-
users downlink NOMA system by considering ﬁnite block-
length constraints. Another approach to enable short packet
transmissions in future networks is to minimize the signalling
overhead. To this end, authors in [130] proposed a signalling
minimization framework in which a user can move freely
within a dynamically allocated user-centric area and commu-
nicate with the network without the need of state transition
signaling of the existing radio resource control. In addition, the
packet transmission efﬁciency with short-packet transmissions
can be enhanced by optimizing the pilot overhead. In this
regard, authors in [158] studied the optimization problem of
achievable rate as a function of pilot length, block length
and error probability. The provided simulation results have
revealed the signiﬁcance of taking the packet size and error
probability into account.

5. Latency Minimization Techniques: In wireless IoT
systems, several factors across different protocol layers con-
tribute to the overall end-to-end latency, thus leading to the
need of promising physical layer and MAC layer techniques
to support the low-latency transmission of TI applications
over the wireless link. In the TI, some of the main delay
components to be considered include transmission delay and
queuing delay. If the average queuing delay is almost equal
to the channel coherence time, the average transmit power
may become unlimited. Therefore, the queuing delay is a key
parameter of TI applications and should be considered in the
TI implementation. This is especially the case when several
types of data exist in the network, each of which has its own
delay sensitivity.

the total

In an LTE-based cellular system,

latency can
be divided into two major parts, i.e., User-plane (U-plane)
latency and Control-plane (C-plane) latency [36]. The U-
plane latency is measured by the directional transmit time
of a packet to reach in the IP layer in between the User
Equipment (UE)/Evolved UMTS Terrestrial RAN (E-UTRAN)
node and the E-UTRAN node/UE. On the other hand, the C-
plane latency corresponds to the transition time of a UE to
switch from the idle state to the active state. Out of these
two categories, the U-plane latency is considered important
for latency minimization since the application performance is
mainly dependent on this component. In addition, regarding
the U-plane latency in a cellular network, it is contributed by
various segments including RAN, backhaul, core network and
Internet/data center.

Cross-layer interactions among different protocol layers are
complex in wireless networks, and it is very important to ad-
dress the issues associated with these cross-layer interactions
from the perspective of sub-milliseconds latency. Since end-to-
end communications usually involves multiple wireless access
technologies, as well as local area networks and core networks,

achieving the desired latency for the transfer of audio, visual
and haptic information is a crucial challenge [159]. This end-
to-end latency in wireless networks can be a function of vari-
ous factors including MAC and networking technologies, link
sharing, service/trafﬁc demands and processing algorithms.
Also, its contribution comes across different layers of the
protocol stack including physical, data-link and networking,
within a single network. If we focus on optimization of latency
in a single layer, it may create harmful effects in other layers
of the protocol. In this regard, authors in [159] carried out the
analysis and classiﬁcation of various enabling technologies for
achieving low-latency networking.

In Table VI, we list several latency reduction techniques
which can be employed across different segments of a wireless
network, i.e., RAN, backhaul and core [36], along with the
related sub-methods and references. In the RAN segment,
the main techniques include transmission frame design, ef-
ﬁcient modulation and design, transmitter design and control
signaling. Furthermore, the main latency minimization tech-
niques concerning the backhaul segment include optical wire-
less backhaul, edge caching, coordinated and mobile-aware
scheduling. Similarly, the main enabling techniques for latency
reduction in the core segment include NFV-based methods,
SDN-based methods, directory-based multicore architecture
and fog/edge computing based design.

The total End-to-End (E2E) latency in a cellular network

can be expressed as follows [36]:

TE2E = 2 × (TRAN + TBackhaul + TCore + TTransport),

(1)

where TRAN is contributed by the UEs, eNodeBs and radio
environment, and corresponds to the packet transmission time
between the UEs and eNodeB. It occurs due to various phys-
ical layer operations including transmission time, processing
time at the UE/eNodeB, retransmission time and propagation
delay. Here, the TRAN for a scheduled user can be expressed
in terms of several contributors as follows [131]:

TRAN = TQ + TFA + Ttx + Tbsp + Tuep,

(2)

where TQ denotes the queuing delay and depends on the
number of users that are multiplexed with the same radio
resources, TFA corresponds to the frame alignment delay and
depends on the transmission frame structure and the involved
duplexing modes, i.e., time division duplexing or frequency
division duplexing. Similarly, Ttx denotes the time required for
transmission processing and payload transmission while Tbsp
and Tuep correspond to the processing delay at the eNodeB
and UE, respectively.

In Equation (1), TBackhaul corresponds to the time required
to make connections between the core network, i.e., Evolved
Packet Core (EPC) and the eNodeB, and this latency depends
on the medium used, for example, microwave, copper or
optical ﬁber. Similarly, TCore refers to the processing time
required at the EPC and this is mainly contributed by various
network elements including SDN/NFV blocks, serving GPRS
support node and Mobility Management Entity (MME). Fur-
thermore, TTransport corresponds to the data communication
time between the EPC network and Cloud/Internet, and this
is contributed by various parameters including the distance

offs among several parameters including latency, reliability,

based system, latency is associated with the control overhead
(about 0.3 − 0.4 ms per transmitted packet) caused by various
ﬁelds including transmission mode, pilot symbols and cyclic
preﬁx [36]. Also, the retransmission time for each packet takes
around 8 ms, and the elimination of this period signiﬁcantly
affects the packet error rate.

6. Reliability Enhancement Techniques: Providing ultra-
high reliability and ultra-low latency with the available lim-
ited bandwidth is one of the crucial requirements in TI
applications. In the following, we discuss the existing works
on various reliability enhancement techniques for URLLC
scenarios including TI applications.

The existing multiple access control protocols in cellular
networks are mostly based on the request and grant mecha-
nism, i.e., the end-devices request for a scheduling request
and then the BS provides a scheduling grant to the users.
Although this Scheduling Request (SR) procedure can provide
deterministic delays,
it also introduces a signiﬁcant delay
due to the involved device-to-BS handshake procedure and
may not be able to meet the requirements of TI applications
[132]. To address this, one of the potential solutions could
be the reservation of some bandwidth for latency-sensitive

users so that
they can immediately transmit their data as
soon as they have some data to transmit. Although such a
bandwidth reservation method has been used in voice over
Internet services having known and ﬁxed transmit rate, the
trafﬁc pattern in TI applications is very bursty and irregular in
nature [190] and this requires efﬁcient bandwidth reservation
techniques.

In the above context, authors in [132] employed a soft
resource reservation scheme for the uplink scheduling of
LTE-based cellular users while addressing the particular re-
quirements of haptic data trafﬁc in cellular networks. In this
soft reservation scheme,
the uplink grant from one trans-
mission is reserved for the subsequent transmissions in a
softer manner without requiring the transmission of any new
information from the device to the BS. Via numerical results,
the performance of the proposed scheme was shown to be
signiﬁcantly better than the conventional SR scheme in terms
of latency minimization. Furthermore, by considering the
very bursty packet arrival processes in URLLC, authors in
[122] investigated the design of a spectrally-efﬁcient resource
management protocol by utilizing both data-driven and model-
based unsupervised learning techniques with the objective of
satisfying the required reliability and latency constraints while
also minimizing the usage of bandwidth. Mainly, to address
the issue of satisfying ultra-high reliability in the scenario with
inaccurate trafﬁc-state classiﬁcation, an optimization problem
was formulated with the objective of minimizing the reserved
bandwidth under the latency and reliability constraints while
also considering the classiﬁcation errors. Via numerical results,
it has been shown that the proposed burstiness-aware method
can save about 40%70% as compared to the traditional meth-
ods while also satisfying reliability and latency constraints.

One of the promising architectures for 5G and beyond
networks is the Cloud-RAN architecture, which can offer
ﬂexibility in terms of moving baseband functionalities to the
Central Unit (CU) which supports multiple remote Radio Units
(RUs) or radio heads via Fronthaul (FH). In addition to other
segments of the network, FH technologies should also be able
to support the low latency and reliable communications for TI

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

26

applications. The traditional FH consists of dedicated point-
to-point links from the CU to each RU; but recently, a more
economic solution of employing multi-path packet-based FH
network instead of dedicated links has emerged and this is
more challenging in terms of meeting high reliability and low
latency requirements of TI applications [133]. The latency
requirements of FH links vary signiﬁcantly between 55 µs
and 1 ms [191] depending on the split between the CU and
the RU.

To fulﬁll these strict requirements, in contrast to the con-
ventional solution of enhancing reliability with the feedback-
based retransmission, transmission redundancy over multiple
FH links between the CU and the RU seems to be an effective
solution. In this regard, authors in [133] proposed to employ
multi-path diversity over multiple FH links and the erasure
coding of the MAC frames to achieve the high reliability
and low latency transmission for TI applications in the C-
RAN based wireless network. The authors investigated the
average latency to achieve the reliable FH transmission as
well as the reliability-latency tradeoff by using a probabilistic
model. While considering the coexistence of enhanced Mobile
Broadband (eMBB) and URLLC services, it was shown that
efﬁcient management of FH resources through orthogonal
allocation can signiﬁcantly lower the average latency and error
probability as compared to the scenario where FH resources
are allocated in a non-orthogonal mode.

The emergence of TI applications including haptic commu-
nications, immersive VR and cooperative automated driving
has led to heterogeneous types of trafﬁc having varying data
rates and packet sizes, with different reliability and latency
requirements. In this regard, it is crucial to develop novel
technologies from the physical layer to the network layer in
order to support these diverse trafﬁcs. In this regard, authors
in [134] discussed some promising physical layer technologies
including multiple-access schemes, waveform multiplexing,
synchronization, channel code design and full-duplex based
transmission for spectrally efﬁcient URLLC in TI services.
Furthermore, to support the TI applications demanding high-
reliability and low-latency, it is extremely important to cat-
egorize the trafﬁc classes based on the trafﬁc features and
QoS requirements in a way that the trafﬁc packets having
the similar features and QoS can be incorporated in each
sub-channel of a multiple access technique. To this end,
authors in [134] have provided typical trafﬁc characteristics
and QoS for different TI applications including immersive
VR, teleoperation, automotive, Internet of drones, and haptic
interpersonal communications.

The reliability target of data transmission ρ is related with
the maximum BLER as: ρ = 1 − BLER and 3GPP targets
to achieve the reliable communications of 10−5 BLER with
1 ms radio latency in future cellular systems [192]. Towards
enabling URLLC applications including industrial automation,
e-Health, TI and vehicular communications in future B5G
communication systems, it is essential to meet the reliability
requirements of both the control and data channels. In this
regard, authors in [135] developed general communication
models for both the uplink and downlink URLLC scenarios by
taking the data and control channel errors into account. The

proposed models considered the reliability constraints on the
control information which deﬁne the conditions under which
a particular service can be supported. However, satisfying
the reliability constraints under the low SNR is challenging
and several enhancement
techniques in terms of channel
estimation and Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) reporting,
SR, Resource Grant (RG), and Acknowledgement (ACK)/Non-
Acknowledgement (NACK) detection have been suggested in
[135] to relax the strict constraints on the control channels. In
Table VII, we list the control channel reliability enhancement
methods under the aforementioned steps of radio access and
channel estimation procedure in cellular networks [135, 193].
Current LTE/LTE-A based cellular networks use feedback-
based link adaptation techniques, i.e., Hybrid Automatic Re-
peat Request (HARQ) based on incremental redundancy in
which the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) to be used
for transmission is ﬁrst selected based on the present chan-
nel condition and in case the transmission fails, subsequent
retransmission is performed by using a more conservative
MCS method. Nevertheless, this feedback-based link adap-
tation approach may increase the communication delay due
to the need of additional transmission time intervals while
waiting for the ACK/NACK message. In addition to the
increased latency, the spectral efﬁciency performance is also
impacted due to continuous exchange of the CSI and large
signalling/retransmission overheads per data packets while
employing feedback-based link adaptation schemes in mMTC
and URLLC systems. To this end, feedback-less of one-
shot transmission schemes can avoid the signalling overheads
involved in feedback-based link adaptation schemes; how-
ever, there appears a tradeoff between the reliability and the
achieved latency. In this regard, the 3GPP proposes to utilize
a scheduling-based radio access in the 5G New Radio (NR),
and it is crucial to perform the radio access conﬁguration at
the 5G NodeB in order to dynamically switch between the
feedback-based and feedback-less transmissions. To this end,
authors in [194] analyzed the tradeoffs between feedback-
less transmission and feedback-based transmission methods,
and proposed an RL-based multi-armed bandit approach to
harmonize the feedback-less and feedback-based transmissions
by utilizing the underlying exploitation-exploration tradeoff.

Furthermore, another critical issue in B5G URLLC-based
TI systems is to enhance the energy efﬁciency without making
a sacriﬁce on the end-to-end latency. To this end, authors in
[195] discussed several trade-offs between the user-plane delay
and energy efﬁciency for future URLLC systems while con-
sidering both the network infrastructure energy efﬁciency and
URLLC device energy efﬁciency. Regarding the infrastructure
energy efﬁciency, the BS on-off switching, retransmissions
and distributed network architectures have been discussed.
Similarly, for the energy efﬁciency enhancement of URLLC
devices, various techniques including discontinuous reception,
power saving mode, mobility measurements and handover
process, were discussed.

Moreover, authors in [193] discussed various technologies
for minimizing the latency and for enhancing the reliability
in the URLLC systems. For the latency minimization pur-
pose, various approaches including novel numerology and

TTI duration, scheduling policies such as non-slot/mini-slot
based scheduling and preemptive scheduling, and grant-free
transmission, can be investigated. Similarly, for the reliability
enhancement, signal power enhancement with micro-diversity
techniques, HARQ enhancement and interference management
techniques have been suggested. Furthermore, for enhancing
the reliability of control channels, several methods including
higher aggregation levels at the physical downlink control
channel transmission, repetition of scheduling information,
asymmetric detection of ACK/NACK and the adaptive con-
ﬁguration of CQI report, can be investigated.

Existing cloud-based computational solutions may suffer
from the long communication delay as well as a high probabil-
ity of error due to imperfections in the involved wireless links.
To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), which brings
the computing/processing units more closer to the user, has
emerged as a promising solution to reduce the delay caused
by the existing cloud computing based solutions. However,
different edge nodes may have varying channel qualities and
the available radio frequency to be allocated for ofﬂoading to
the MEC nodes is limited. Furthermore, it may be challenging
to ensure a sufﬁcient reliability concurrently while reducing
the involved computational and communication latencies. To
this end, authors in [196] formulated a joint optimization
problem to minimize the latency as well as the ofﬂoading
failure probability and proposed three algorithms based on
heuristic search, semi-deﬁnite relaxation and a linearization
technique to solve the formulated optimization problem.

7. Short-range Communication Technologies: In contrast
to the eMBB, the main performance metrics for URLLC in
emerging 5G scenarios such as industrial automation include
low-latency and ultra-reliability. The conventional broadcast-
ing strategy in an industrial factory may not be efﬁcient to
satisfy the URLLC requirements due to the massive number
of actuators to be supported. In this direction, authors in
[197] proposed a two-phase transmission protocol by forming
clusters of D2D networks to enable URLLC in 5G wireless
systems.

M2M is another promising short-range communication tech-
nology for providing ubiquitous connectivity among devices
the human control. The upcoming cellular tech-
without
nologies and infrastructures are expected to support M2M
communications; however, several challenges in terms of
supporting the massive number of connections, diverse QoS
requirements of different applications, energy efﬁciency and
spectral efﬁciency, need to be addressed [19]. Furthermore,

congestion and system overloading are other crucial issues
since the concurrent transmissions from a huge number of
M2M devices may create congestion in both the random access
and trafﬁc channels [114, 198]. For the provisioning of M2M
communications over the 3GPP LTE/LTE-A based cellular
networks, three main deployment paradigms have been deﬁned
by the 3GPP, namely, direct model, indirect model and hybrid
model [199]. In the direct model, the Application Server (AS)
directly connects to an operator to communicate with the M2M
devices without using the services of any external Service
Capability Service (SCS). Besides, in the indirect model, the
AS is connected to the operator networks indirectly via the
services of SCS to utilize the additional value added services
of M2M. Finally, the hybrid model concurrently utilizes both
the direct and indirect models for connecting the M2M devices
to an operator network by using direct communications or an
SCS.

2) Network Layer and Cloud-Level Solutions: In the fol-
lowing, we discuss various network layer and cloud-level
solutions towards supporting TI applications in B5G wireless
networks.
1. Software Deﬁned Networking: The transfer of high-
rate mission-critical trafﬁc in the upcoming 5G and beyond
networks needs the support from multiple radio access tech-
nologies and demands for dynamic orchestration of resources
across both the core network and radio access segments. It is
envisioned that 5G systems will be able to offer the features
of network slicing, multi-connectivity and end-to-end quality
provisioning mechanisms for transferring critical data within
a software-controlled network. In this regard, the contribution
in [136] introduced a softwarized 5G architecture to enhance
the end-to-end reliability of the mission-critical trafﬁc along
with the corresponding mathematical framework.

Furthermore, authors in [137] considered the problem of
reducing the communication latency in TI applications and
demonstrated the signiﬁcance of network coding in improving
the communication latency and in reducing the packet re-
transmission frequency. Also, a prototype to demonstrate the
seamless integration of network coding with SDN towards a
code centric network architecture was presented by imple-
menting encoders, recoders and decoders as virtual network
functions.

In order to guarantee the end-to-end reliability for the trans-
fer of high-rate mission-critical trafﬁc in 5G mobile networks,
the network should be capable of supporting multiple radio
access technologies and should perform dynamic allocation of

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

28

resources across the core network and radio access segments.
One of the promising platforms to achieve the desired end-
to-end reliability in 5G networks is to utilize the concept of
network softwarization to form a softwarized 5G architecture.
In this regard, authors in [138] employed SDN and Network
Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies to form an NFV-
based SDN architecture in which all 5G network functions run
as components of the software and the data plane is controlled
by the SDN-like features.

2. Network Virtualization: Network virtualization is an-
other promising technology enabler for supporting TI in B5G
wireless networks. The most challenging requirements of TI
applications are to meet the latency requirement of about less
than 1 ms and “ﬁve-nines” reliability, i.e., a one in a million
chance of failure. One of the TI scenario examples which need
such stringent requirements is the remote medical operations
in which a surgeon needs to feel the sensation of touch and
implement control actions by using force-feedback via the
haptic clothing and other equipments. To this end, authors
in [7] proposed the combined use of virtualized sub-GHz
radios and licensed mobile radio to realize the TI in medical
imagery applications. Also, the proposed concept was veriﬁed
by employing Ofcom TV whitespace as the sub-GHz medium.
In addition, authors in [139] proposed a ﬂexible cloud-
based RAN for TI applications by utilizing the principle
of dynamic network slicing, where the UE trafﬁc can be
temporarily ofﬂoaded from the operator’s provided networks to
the user’s provided network whenever needed. Subsequently,
a two-step matching game was employed for trafﬁc-aware
resource allocation in the proposed architecture with dynamic
network slicing and load balancing; also ofﬂoading principles
the concept of ﬂexible RAN. Via
were used to support
numerical results, the authors demonstrated the signiﬁcance
of this deployment to the network operators and the end-users
over the conventional CRANs.

3. Network Coding: Network coding can be considered as
a promising technique to effectively manage the distributed
communications and caching resources with a single code
structure [140]. With regard to TI applications, network coding
will facilitate the network operator in its task of increasing the
reliability of its storage data against the failure of caching
or computing nodes. The data reliability can be enhanced
via some redundancy, which can be in the form of coded
information or simple replication. Although the replication
process requires the transfer of minimal trafﬁc in case of a
node failure, different storage nodes are needed to replicate
the stored data. On the other hand, the conventional block
codes including ReedSolomon codes can drastically reduce the
storage cost as compared to that of the storage required by the
replication approach. However, all the information needs to be
transferred over the network to recover the lost information,
thus leading to a storage-repair trafﬁc tradeoff. To this end,
network coding can enable the operation of the system at the
optimal points by balancing the storage-repair trafﬁc tradeoff
[200]. The re-coding capability of network coding enhances
the information reliability as well as balances the storage-
repair tradeoff without the need of costly investments in the
network architecture [140].

Furthermore, authors in [141] utilized network coding to
optimize the transmission reliability while taking the unknown
and varying channel capacity into account. The multipath TCP
discussed in the literature utilizes multiple paths to improve
the throughput and reliability performance, but it suffers from
the higher delay due to the employed Automatic Repeat
Request (ARQ) as in the conventional TCP. To address these
issues, the utilization of different multiple TCP schedulers
[201] and rate allocation to minimize the latency [142] have
been discussed in the literature. In contrast, authors in [141]
considered the network coding-based approach with the ﬁxed-
rate application trafﬁc and time-varying channel capacity. The
proposed method compensates the loss of capacity with the
diversity of the paths and it is not dependent on the feedback
required to maintain the reliability. An optimization framework
was formulated to ﬁnd the rate allocation for the paths which
minimizes the error on all
the conﬁgurations of channel
capacities and the performance was evaluated with the help
of real-world measurements.

4. Collaborative Edge/Fog

and Cloud Comput-
ing/Processing: In contrast to the traditional Internet which
focuses on transferring audio and visual senses, TI aims to
transfer touch and actuation in the real-time. The MEC can be
considered as one of the enablers for TI to reduce the round
trip latency and perform the computational ofﬂoading from
the cellular network. Furthermore, the MEC can provide the
cloud-like functionalities including caching and computational
resources at the edge-side of the network in order to reduce the
latency and to better utilize the backhaul and core network re-
sources [146]. The MEC can beneﬁt from the already existing
ubiquitous coverage of cellular networks to support IoT and TI
applications. It can facilitate multi-service and multi-tenancy
operations to allow third-parties to utilize the edge-storage and
computing facilities by offering an open radio network edge
platform. In [143], the authors proposed a novel approach
for a multi-level cloud-based cellular system in which each
small-cell is equipped with edge computing capabilities via its
connection with a micro-cloud unit. In the considered multi-
level cloud architecture, micro-clouds are connected to the
mini-clouds and ultimately to the main central-cloud. Due to
the trade-off involved between the number of mini-clouds and
their costs, it is necessary to optimize the number of mini-
clouds and micro-clouds connected to the mini-cloud.

Various emerging future applications including industrial In-
ternet, smart grids and driverless cars simultaneously demand
for high bandwidth, resilience, low latency communication and
security. Also, there is a growing need of shifting the store-
and-forward networks towards the mobile edge cloud in order
to enable the movement of the cloud as the device moves
across the network. This novel concept of mobile edge cloud
will enable advanced migration techniques and will support
latency-sensitive services. In this regard, the authors in [144]
proposed an agile cloud migration method for mobilizing
the real-time and latency-sensitive applications frequently and
quickly between multiple servers over the Internet.

In TI applications related to robotics and human-to-robot
communications, limited energy, computing power and storage
resources become problematic, and efﬁcient task allocation

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

29

strategies need to be investigated. One of the promising
approaches in this regard is task ofﬂoading to the collaborative
nodes for enhancing the energy efﬁciency and task execution
time. To this end, authors in [145] investigated a task allocation
strategy by utilizing the conventional cloud, decentralized
cloudlets and neighboring nodes to perform computational
ofﬂoading. They have developed an analytical framework to
compute the energy consumption, task response time and
task allocation delay in integrated ﬁber-wireless multi-robot
networks.

5. Caching Techniques: To enable the support of URLLC
applications, it is crucial to redesign the wireless network
architecture, including the RAN, the core network and the
backhaul links between the RAN and the core network. Some
of the promising enablers include SDN, NFV, edge-caching
and MEC, and these technologies can contribute in reducing
the latency by providing seamless operation and indepen-
dence from the hardware functionality [36]. Furthermore,
new physical air interfaces with small packet sizes, small
transmission interval time, new waveforms, MCSs, need to be
investigated for latency minimization. Other emerging meth-
ods including radio resource optimization, carrier aggregation,
massive MIMO and priority based data transmission need to
be addressed towards this direction.

Moreover, proactive in-network caching has been receiving
a signiﬁcant attention in information-centric networking in
order to reduce the latency of the upcoming wireless sys-
tems [36]. This caching method mainly involves four types
of caching, namely, local caching, D2D caching, small BS
caching and macro BS caching. Out of these, local caching
refers to caching at the user devices and D2D caching relies on
D2D communications within the small cells. Similarly, small
BS and macro BS caching refer to caching at the respective
BSs. Furthermore, hybrid caching schemes can be exploited by
combining the aforementioned caching schemes. In this regard,
authors in [147] devised an energy-efﬁcient hybrid caching
scheme for TI applications along with a cache replacement
policy to match this hybrid caching scheme by considering the
Zipf distribution-based popularity of cached ﬁles. Via numeri-
cal results, it has been shown that the proposed hybrid scheme
can reduce the latency while enhancing the overall energy
efﬁciency for supporting TI applications in B5G networks. In
addition, predictive caching can help to overcome the range
limit of TI services due to the ﬁnite speed of light (the TI
service range is limited to 100 km while using ﬁber) [148].

6. Machine Learning (ML)/Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)
Techniques: One of the main issues in TI is to understand the
context of the remote terminals and the involved interactions,
which is referred to as tactile cognizance [151]. Understanding
such contextual information helps in delivering the perceived
real-time operation in addition to the quality and depth of
the haptic feedback. To this end, AI could be signiﬁcantly
useful in TI applications for different purposes including the
following [151]: (i) predicting the movement and action for
compensating the physical limitations of remote latency, (ii)
predicting the inference of movement and action for long-term
skill acquisition and replication, and (iii) predicting reliable
communication parameters.

In the above context, authors in [149] proposed a scalable
intelligence-enabled networking platform to remove the trafﬁc
redundancy in 5G audio-visual TI scenarios. The proposed
platform incorporates a control plane, a user plane, an intel-
ligent management plane and an intelligence-enabled plane.
Out of these planes, the intelligence-enabled plane comprises
a novel learning system that has decision making capability
for the generalization and personalization in the presence of
conﬂicting, imbalanced and partial data. Furthermore, authors
in [150] studied the application of ML intelligence in taking
effective decisions for dynamically allocating the frequency
resources in a heterogeneous ﬁber-wireless network. More
speciﬁcally, they investigated the utilization of an artiﬁcial
neural network for the following purposes: (i) in learning
network uplink latency performance by utilizing diverse net-
work features, and (ii) in taking ﬂexible bandwidth allocation
decisions towards reducing the uplink latency.

The upcoming 5G networks need to meet several require-
ments in terms of scalability, security, low latency, mobil-
ity on demand and compatibility. However, the current IP
address-based Internet architecture may not be capable of
meeting these requirements due its inherent limitations in
supporting on-demand mobility and scalable routing. In this
context, authors in [149] proposed a scalable intelligence-
enabled networking, which is realized by utilizing information-
centric networking schemes including identiﬁer-locator map-
ping, routing and forwarding, to test the performance in typical
5G scenarios such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB),
URLLC and mMTC. In addition, an intelligence-enabled plane
is also introduced by decoupling the functions of learning and
the decision making from the management and control planes.
7. Network Architectural Enhancements: To address the
challenging requirements of TI such as ultra-reliable and
ultra-responsive network connectivity, many segments of the
current mobile communication network infrastructures need to
be signiﬁcantly redesigned. Several enhancements need to be
carried out including the design at the chip/circuit level, the re-
design of the PHY/MAC layer solutions and cloud-computing
solutions. From the perspective of backhaul/fronthaul designs,
current individual and incompatible fronthaul/backhaul sys-
tems need to be migrated towards an integrated and ﬂexible
cross-haul network.

Furthermore, in contrast to the conventional Internet sys-
tem which is designed to mainly transfer audio and visual
information, TI should also be able to provide a medium to
transport touch and actuation in the real-time. In other words,
the architecture should be able to support both haptic and
non-haptic information via the Internet, requiring the need of
signiﬁcant enhancements in the current network architecture.
The end-to-end architecture of a basic TI system can be
divided into three main domains, namely master domain,
network domain and a slave domain [51], which are brieﬂy
described as follows.

As discussed earlier in Sec. II-A, the master domain of the
TI architecture is comprised of a human as an operator along
with an HSI which converts the human input to the tactile input
by using different tactile encoding techniques, and a machine
controller [48]. A haptic device acts as an HSI and it enables

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

30

a user to touch, feel and manipulate the objects in the virtual
and real environments via the exchange of haptic information.
In addition, the motion control devices can perform similar
remote interaction functions without the exchange of haptic
information, and the perceptual performance is enhanced via
auditory and visual feedbacks [48]. Also, multiple human
controllers can be involved in the master domain of some
applications in order to carry out the collaborative operation
of the slave domain. On the other hand, the machine controller
comprises some digital controllers for industrial applications
with several control algorithms with or without feedback.

Another component slave domain contains a tele-operator,
i.e., a controlled robot, which interacts with several objects
in the remote environment and is directly controlled by the
master domain via various commands. In the context of NCSs,
the slave domain comprises a system of sensors and actuators,
in which the sensors measure the system state while the
actuators adapt the system based on the commands obtained
from the controller. On the other hand, the network domain
provides a medium of bidirectional communication between
master and slave domains, i.e., the interactions of a human to a
remote environment. With the help of command and feedback
signals, a global control loop is closed with the information
exchanged between the master and controlled (slave) domains
[51]. TI applications need ultra-reliable and ultra-responsive
connectivity to enable the efﬁcient and timely delivery of
sensing/actuation, control and touch information in the real
time. Due to these stringent requirements of TI applications,
current wireless networks should be substantially modiﬁed in
terms of functional, architectural and protocol stack aspects.
One of the emerging concepts in the ﬁeld of TI is tactile
cyber-physical system, which has a wide variety of application
scenarios including connected cars, smart grids, telemedicine,
telepresence and interactive applications having actuators and
sensors. In this regard, authors in [152] provided a high level
block diagram of tactile cyber physical systems consisting of
three main components, namely, an operator end, a teleop-
erator end and a tactile support network. They also discussed
various underlying challenges from the system design perspec-
tive.

Moreover, one important design approach of TI is the
Human-Agent-Robot Teamwork (HART) [202]. In contrast
to the conventional approaches which divide the work only
between machines and humans without creating any syner-
gies, HART-based TI approach enables humans and robots
to act as intelligent multi-agent systems, by exploiting the
heterogeneous features of cognitive and physical tasks with the
help of the cloud-center and dencentralized cloudlet resources.
In such applications, collaborative robots (so-called cobots)
can sense the surrounding environment and cooperate with
other robots in contrast to the conventional stand-alone robots,
which are incapable of sense the environment. However, for
the efﬁcient design of an HART-centric approach, various
contextual aspects related to the task (deadline, task size, task-
type), the mobility, the latency, availability and capability of
the collaborative agent/robot needs to be properly considered.
In this regard, authors in [153] studied the context-aware
task migration techniques for efﬁciently performing real-time

collaborations among the cloud/cloudlets, collaborative robots
and human mobile users in the converged ﬁber-wireless com-
munication infrastructures. In addition to the selection of a
suitable cobot, the scheme suggested in [153] deals with the
migration of a task from one collaborative node to another
towards reducing the task execution latency.

VII. SECURITY AND PRIVACY FOR TI APPLICATIONS

In the 5G-based wireless TI system, it is highly important to
investigate techniques which can mitigate the radio jamming
attacks since the wireless medium is intrinsically vulnerable
to these attacks. The intelligent jamming attacks in wireless
systems can be mainly categorized into two types, namely,
control channel attacks and data channel attacks [148]. The
jamming of uplink or/and downlink control signals can result
in the failure of the transmissions and receptions of packets
over the data channels.

The security threat in IoT systems including TI may arise
in any phase of the data processing including data acquisition,
information ﬁltering, data fusion, representation, modeling,
processing and interpretation [34]. The main security issues in
IoT systems include terminal security (e.g., illegal intrusion in
device access, operation and control), data transmission secu-
rity (e.g., stealing or loss of data due to unsafe transmission
protocols), data processing security (e.g., revealing personal
information) and management security (e.g., scalability of
security techniques with massive data) [203]. As compared
to the conventional scenarios, privacy loss may occur with a
very high probability in wireless IoT systems due to various
factors including higher level of interaction with the smart
devices, location-based services and low awareness level on
the user-side, thus leading to the investigation of novel privacy
preserving mechanisms [204]. Also, due to the massive scale
and distributed nature of IoT networks, maintaining the privacy
of IoT data ﬂowing in the network and fusion of data with
privacy preservation are crucial aspects to be considered.

The conventional security policies are usually centralized
and are not effective in maintaining the security of dis-
tributed and heterogeneous IoT systems. In this regard, sev-
eral security enhancement and privacy preservation mecha-
nisms/frameworks have been recently suggested for IoT ap-
plications [135, 205–213]. In Table VIII, we provide the key
contributions of these works and their main focus on privacy
or security or both.

In the following, we discuss the key enabling technologies

to enhance the security and privacy of TI applications.

1. Blockchain: A blockchain consists of a list of records
or blocks which are linked to each-other by utilizing cryp-
tography. In the emerging content-oriented networks, content
providers may not have full control over their data due to
high cost and complexity, and a large amount of information
in the user’s content, including user name and location, can
be learned easily if the information is not properly encrypted.
To this end, it is crucial to develop effective access control
and encryption techniques to preserve the underlying privacy
information in future B5G networks supporting TI applica-
tions. The emerging blockchain technology can be considered

a promising solution to achieve privacy preservation in future
wireless systems since this distributed ledger system consisting
of a number of blocks is considered to be public, secure and
veriﬁed [214]. Each block of a blockchain contains a hash
to be used for the integrity veriﬁcation of the transaction
information and the hash value of a block is dependent on
the hash value of its preceding block.

Due to the openness and tamper-resistant features of the
blockchain ledger, it can be useful to guarantee the privacy
and access control of the content provider. To this end,
authors in [215] proposed a blockchain-based approach to
address privacy issues in future content-oriented 5G networks
by utilizing mutual trust between the users and the content
providers. The blockchain has been combined with encrypted
cloud storage based on the providers’ data records present
in the content-centric network. In this proposed approach
[215], the tamper-resistant access policy on the public ledger
enables the complete control of own information for each
data owner. Furthermore, other advantages of this approach
are that it enables reduced network congestion level, latency
minimization and effective cost control.

Although the blockchain technologies can enhance the
degree of trust between devices in a decentralized network,
some of its drawbacks include high equipment performance
requirements and large-scale network formation. To this end,
authors in [203] suggested a multi-layer distributed model
by combining the capabilities of the cloud-server and the
reliability and security of IoT with the help of blockchain tech-
niques. This blockchain-based multi-layer model is expected to
provide several advantages, including the local coordination of
IoT equipment with a centralized unit with improved safety, a
reduction of the computational and network load of IoT with
the help of multiple centers, and a secure and reliable IoT
network with the contract records in multiple blockchains.
On the contrary, such a model enhances the total network
cost and also consumes much network resources and time to
maintain the contracts [203]. In the similar context, authors in
[216] proposed a joint cloud computing-based IoT service to
address the privacy and data fusion issues of a single cloud
approach used in most of the existing IoT services. This joint
cloud computing based model in combination with blockchain
can provide a trusted environment in order to exchange the
resources among the clouds and to record all the involved
transactions with the help of blockchain.

2. Edge/Fog Computing: Edge/fog computing is consid-
ered as a promising paradigm to extend the cloud functional-
ities (computing, data storage, communication, and network-

ing) to the edge of the network; and it is signiﬁcantly useful
to support low-latency, mobility, location-awareness and geo-
distributed applications [34, 103]. However, the introduction
of fog/edge computing brings the issues of security and
privacy in IoT network including TI applications. Since the
devices may malfunction or become susceptible to malicious
attacks, it is highly essential to maintain a high level of trust
between IoT devices and fog nodes so that the fog nodes can
validate whether the service requesting devices are genuine
or not [211]. However, due to mobility issues and the lack
of a centralized management, the existing trust models used
in cloud computing platform cannot be directly applicable
to fog computing scenarios. For example, the widely-used
reputation-based trust models in e-commerce services may not
be applicable for fog computing due to the dynamic nature of
fog nodes and end-user devices in the fog layers. To this end,
measuring the trust of a fog service and deﬁning, verifying
and monitoring the key attributes which characterize the trust
of a fog service, are important aspects to be investigated.

Furthermore, it is important to ensure the security of the
communications between fog nodes and resource-constrained
IoT nodes, as well as communications among the distributed
fog nodes. Also, since the fog nodes which are in the proxim-
ity to the end-users may collect sensitive information such
as location, identity and utility usage, privacy preservation
becomes challenging in fog nodes as compared to privacy
preservation in cloud computing nodes. Moreover, since fog
nodes may act as data aggregation and control point of the
data gathered from the resource-constrained distributed IoT
devices, authentication at different levels of gateways is also
an important issue [217].

3. Machine Learning: In IoT networks including TI,
there may arise several security threats including Denial of
Service (DoS) attacks, jamming, spooﬁng, man-in-the-middle
attack, software attacks and privacy leakage. To minimize
these threats and to improve the network security in wireless
IoT networks, the emerging ML techniques seem promising.
To this end, different ML techniques including supervised,
unsupervised and reinforcement learning have been widely
employed for access control, authentication, malware detection
and anti-jamming ofﬂoading applications in different scenarios
[210]. However, the conventional ML techniques may not be
directly applicable for the resource-constrained IoT devices
and there exist several challenges in employing ML techniques
in an IoT environment, including limited computational, radio
and energy resources, distributed nature of devices, ultra-
reliable and low-latency requirements for the learning outputs

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

32

and the incorporation of heterogeneous trafﬁc, including the
traditional audio-visual, machine-type trafﬁc and haptic trafﬁc
[113]. To this end, it is important to investigate innovative
learning-based authentication, access control, secure ofﬂoad-
ing/storage for IoT/TI devices to protect from different attacks
including physical and MAC layer, jamming, eavesdropping
and smart attacks [210].

4. SDN-based Design: The SDN can greatly simplify the
network management and control, and it can be a promising
technology to enhance the security and privacy of IoT/TI
applications. The integration of SDN in an IoT environment
can provide the following advantages [218]: (i) The network’s
ability is enhanced by efﬁciently exploiting the under-utilized
resources, (ii) Various steps of information processing in IoT
networks including data/information acquisition, information
analysis and decision making become simpliﬁed, (iii) The
available network resources and access can be managed ef-
ﬁciently in a situation-aware manner to enhance the data link
capacity between the users/devices, (iv) IoT networks can be
made more scalable according to the demand and more agile
with the help of an SDN platform, and (v) SDN-based trafﬁc
pattern analyzers will signiﬁcantly help to simplify the data
collection tools from the IoT devices. Furthermore, due to the
decoupling of data plane from the control plane, hackers will
have hard time accessing the data even if they become able to
reach to the data plane. Also, SDN helps to automatically ﬁnd
an endpoint or a network segment impacted by the malware.
More importantly, since SDN can have a global view of the
underlying network including the mobility of nodes, trafﬁc
patterns and trafﬁc volumes, it becomes simpler to implement
security policies in SDN-enabled IoT networks than in the
traditional networks [218].

In the above context, some research works in the lit-
erature have studied the security aspects of SDN in IoT
networks. Authors in [219] proposed a security architecture
for IoT networks, which is capable of restricting the network
access to unauthorized devices by utilizing the capabilities
of SDN. Mainly, the integration of authorized ﬂows in the
IoT network and the authentication of IoT devices has been
utilized to secure IoT networks from malicious devices and
attacks. Furthermore, authors in [220] proposed a combination
of a centralized SDN control-plane, deterministic low-jitter
scheduling, and lightweight encryption in layer 2 as a novel
approach for enhancing the wireless security in emerging
industrial IoT systems,
including industrial IoT. With this
approach, deterministic scheduling of the source, destination,
time-slot and wireless channel can be achieved for every
wireless transmission, and any unauthorized transmissions,
even with a single packet, can be quickly detected in the layer
2 and this information can be sent to the SDN control plane
for the corrective action.

VIII. OPEN ISSUES AND FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

In the following subsections, we discuss some open research
issues and recommend some future research directions in
various topics related to wireless TI.

A. URLLC in TI Applications

In URLLC applications of TI including immersive VR,
teleoperation and cooperative automated driving, it is essential
to effectively deliver haptic trafﬁc (tactile and kinesthetic infor-
mation) in addition to the conventional audio and video trafﬁc
[221]. Such heterogeneous and sporadic trafﬁc types bring
challenges in terms of latency and reliability requirements,
thus leading to the need of novel technologies across the
physical layer to the network layer. Furthermore, in contrast
to the moderate reliability and very high rate for the visual
perception, haptic perception needs ﬁxed rate and high relia-
bility. Therefore, in visual-haptic VR communications, there is
a need to consider both aforementioned objectives in a single
underlying network. One promising technique to enable this
is network slicing, which can create two different slices: one
eMBB slice for the visual perception and a URLLC slice for
the haptic perception [222].

Balancing the tradeoff between energy efﬁciency and la-
tency is another crucial aspect to be addressed in URLLC
systems. To this end, one interesting future research direction
is to evaluate the energy efﬁciency and delay tradeoffs in
the unlicensed spectrum (i.e., 60 GHz) since the continuous
channel sensing required by the regulations in the unlicensed
band causes a limit on the maximum transmission time [195].
Another important research question is how to enable the
coexistence of TI systems operating under strict latency and re-
liability constraints with other systems such as eMBB systems
demanding high throughput applications, and mMTC systems
whose main target is to support a massive number of devices.
How to efﬁciently multiplex URLLC trafﬁc from TI systems
and the trafﬁc of other systems including URLLC and eMBB
in both the downlink and uplink of future wireless systems is
an important research issue to be addressed. Another crucial
issue is how to prioritize the TI trafﬁc with guarantees across
both the access layer and network layer.

One promising approach suggested by the 3GPP for the
multiplexing of URLLC and eMBB trafﬁc in the downlink
is preemptive scheduling [223], in which the eMBB trafﬁc is
scheduled on all the available radio resources with a longer
transmission time interval (i.e., 1 ms) and whenever the
URLLC packet arrives at the 5G eNodeB, it is transmitted
to the respective user immediately by overwriting the ongoing
eMBB transmission [193]. However, the main issue with this
approach is that the decoding performance of eMBB users
gets degraded. To mitigate this issue, the 3GPP has introduced
the parameter puncturing indication to inform the victim user
which part of the transmission has been overwritten so that
this effect can be considered during its transmission. Also,
for the uplink multiplexing of the eMBB and URLLC trafﬁc,
the pause and resume method proposed by the 3GPP enables
the URLLC user to take the already allocated resources from
the eMBB user [193]. In addition to inter-user multiplexing,
intra-user multiplexing of eMBB and URLLC trafﬁc could be
another issue since the same user may use both the eMBB and
URLLC services.

One of the promising future directions for enhancing the
reliability of TI applications over wireless networks is to utilize

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

33

the simultaneous connections with the help of multiple links.
Also, another promising method is to utilize multiple paths for
graph connectivity to avoid the single point of failure. Towards
this direction, emerging graph signal processing techniques
[224] can be utilized to address various issues in large-scale
wireless TI networks.

B. Latency Reduction in Wireless TI Systems

As highlighted earlier in Table VI,

there exist several
solutions towards reducing the latency in various segments of
a wireless network. However, it is crucial to investigate novel
methods across different segments of a wireless network to
further reduce the latency towards supporting TI applications
in B5G networks. In the RAN segment, although millimeter
wave (mmWave) communications seems to be a promising
technology, several issues including non-line-of-sight beam-
forming, channel modeling with delay spread and angular
spread, doppler, multi-path, atmospheric absorption and reﬂec-
tion/refraction/attenuation need further attention [225]. Fur-
thermore, due to small-packet transmissions in IoT applica-
tions including TI, the conventional assumption of averaging
out of the thermal noise and distortion for large packet sizes
does not hold. Therefore, it is an important future research
direction to investigate suitable transmission strategies and
channel modeling for short packets across diverse frequency
bands. Moreover, in most of the OFDM-based systems, syn-
chronization and orthogonality cause a bottleneck in obtaining
a lower latency and it is important to investigate suitable
non-orthogonal and asynchronous multiple access schemes
and waveforms which do not require much coordination and
can provide robustness in the presence of channel fading
and varying interference conditions [36, 126]. In addition, the
investigation of low complexity antenna structures, beam-
steering active antenna array with beam steering capability,
efﬁcient symbol detection including compressed sensing and
low-complexity sensing techniques,
is important for low-
latency communications. Other important future aspects in-
clude the treatment of latency sensitive packets either by
providing priority-based timely access to the latency sensitive
packets or by the reservation of resources. In addition, it is
crucial to investigate suitable load-aware MAC protocols for
TI applications to achieve the desired ultra-low latency with
ultra-high reliability.

In the core network side, the main issues include the man-
agement and orchestration of heterogeneous resources includ-
ing computing, network and storage [226] in the SDN/NFV-
based core network while also minimizing the latency, and the
need of intelligent, dynamic and adaptive techniques for the
effective utilization of the existing heterogeneous backhauling
networks. Moreover, further analysis and understanding of
various tradeoffs including memory versus data-rate, storage
versus link load and capacity versus latency in caching-
enabled mobile edge computing, is needed. In addition, some
important research directions in the context of caching-enabled
wireless networks include the investigation of the impact
location and wireless link parameters on
of caching size,
the end-to-end latency, the design of suitable protocols for

intra-cache communications and caching redundancy with the
latency constraint, and handover management in the scenarios
having diverse caching capability with lower latency [36].
Furthermore, to overcome the issue of range limitation due
to ﬁnite speed of light, emerging ML/AI techniques could be
incorporated into the edge-side of TI networks in a way that
necessary actions can be autonomously taken without the need
of waiting for the action result to propagate from the network.

C. Dynamic Resource Allocation in TI Systems

The effective allocation of the involved resources in TI sys-
tems while satisfying the stringent latency and reliability con-
straints calls for the investigation of novel resource allocation
techniques. In contrast to the conventional design approach of
independent resource allocation in the uplink and downlink,
joint uplink and downlink design is important for TI appli-
cations consisting of a closed-loop [55]. However, resource
allocation in TI systems is an unexplored domain that needs
signiﬁcant future attention. Various resources including com-
munication resources (backhaul/fronthaul/access bandwidth,
transmit power, antennas, device battery), computing resources
(processor speed, memory size, computation rate/power) and
caching resources (storage) [34] are distributed throughout the
B5G wireless networks supporting TI applications and they
need to be managed optimally in order to utilize the available
resources efﬁciently.

One promising direction to manage the distributed resources
is to employ edge/fog computing as well as the cooperation of
distributed edge computing nodes having different levels of en-
ergy and computing resources [103]. In such distributed edge
computing based TI systems, several challenges including the
energy efﬁciency and computational efﬁciency of edge nodes,
energy-efﬁcient task ofﬂoading and service response time of
the end-users, need to be addressed [227]. Furthermore, collab-
orative edge-cloud processing seems promising in utilizing the
advantages of both the cloud-computing and edge-computing
paradigms [34]. Moreover, efﬁcient management of admission
control and user association is another promising approach
to reduce the communication latency in wireless TI systems
since the users can be associated with a suitable BS/access
point which is able to serve them with the lowest latency.

In addition, towards enabling the priority-based resource
allocation to TI applications and tactile-speciﬁc scheduling
the SDN-based design and
techniques in B5G networks,
network virtualization seem promising. These paradigms will
enable the ﬂexible management of network/resource slices
along with the required isolation and customization across
different user devices and heterogeneous applications [54]. In
this direction, future research works should focus on investi-
gating suitable bandwidth-based and/or resource-based slicing
techniques, isolation techniques to isolate resources across user
devices or applications, and priority-based resource allocation
and scheduling techniques for haptic users/applications.

D. Haptic communications

In contrast to the traditional communications, haptic com-
munications demand for some speciﬁc requirements in terms

IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS (SUBMITTED DRAFT)

34

of symmetric resource allocation in both the uplink and
downlink, joint resource allocation in both the downlink and
uplink, the consideration of bounded delay and guaranteeing
the minimum rate throughout the haptic session. Furthermore,
as detailed earlier in Section III, there exist several challenges
in employing haptic communications in future B5G networks.
Some of these challenges include the efﬁcient design of haptic
devices and haptic codecs, maintaining the stability for control
loop system, the design of effective multiplexing schemes to
handle the cross-modal asynchrony due to the heterogeneous
requirements of visual, haptic and auditory modalities. Other
issues for the realization of haptic communications include:
(i) achieving ultra-high reliability and ultra-responsive con-
nectivity, (ii) prioritized and ﬂexible resource allocation, (iii)
incorporation of area-based or distributed sensing, (iv) overlay
creation for multiuser haptic communications, and (v) the
deﬁnition of novel performance metrics.

To address these issues, suitable physical/MAC layer and
cloud/network level based solutions (detailed in Section VI-B)
should be investigated. Furthermore, due to time-varying
delays and packet
the system instability could be
problematic in practical haptic communications systems. One
of the promising solutions to address this issue could be to
investigate the applicability of ML techniques for enhancing
the stability of the haptic control.

losses,

E. Wireless Augmented/Virtual Reality

One of the main issues in wireless AR/VR is to investigate
suitable B5G network architecture which can deliver AR/VR
capability, and to identify the corresponding interfaces to con-
nect the AR/VR devices/terminals with the wireless network
[228]. Also, another interesting research issue is how to utilize
the advantages of the emerging edge-caching, multicasting and
edge computing technologies for wireless AR/VR applica-
tions. Furthermore, other issues include identifying the rate
adaptation mechanism for AR/VR, satisfying the reliability
requirements of AR/VR at the network layer, characterizing
the motion prediction, adapting the transport protocols based
on the user channel information, characterizing QoS on the
real-time by utilizing the SDN-based platform, and deﬁning
the interactions with the SDN controller.

In contrast

to the conventional VR systems, which are
mostly deployed over wired systems, wireless medium can
provide much higher freedom of movement of immersion.
However, the deployment of VR applications in a wireless
environment faces a number of challenges, including how to
characterize the QoS of the VR systems, how to manage
both the tracking and QoS over highly dynamic wireless
channels and how to design high data-rate and low-latency
links to the VR services. Furthermore, other issues related to
compression, data analytics and signal processing, need to be
further investigated for wireless VR/AR systems.

Furthermore, with regard to mobile AR and web AR, there
exist several challenges including the requirement of powerful
computing versus limited computing capability of mobile de-
vices, the requirement of real-time perception versus network
delay, very high energy consumption versus limited battery

capability of mobile/edge AR devices and the requirement
of pervasive promotion versus diverse infrastructures (data
formats, operating systems, computing and display platforms
[77]. Also, related industries, academia and standardization
bodies need to work together to resolve the compatibility
issues arising from the diverse nature of devices, applications
and infrastructures, in order to realize pervasive mobile and
web AR.

F. Hardware, Computational and Network Architectural Is-
sues

It would be ideal to have a separate network for haptic
communications to meet the necessary requirements, however,
due to the involved capital and operating expenditures, this
is not a feasible solution [54]. Therefore, future B5G net-
works should be designed in a ﬂexible way that they can
simultaneously support various vertical applications including
haptic, M2M, V2V, conventional video/data/voice while sat-
isfying their diverse QoS requirements. One of the promising
approaches in this regard is network slicing, by which different
network slices can be allocated to different vertical sectors
and can provide network on demand functionalities. To realize
such a virtual network over a common physical network, the
emerging SDN and NFV technologies seem promising. Also,
self-organizing networking solutions can be utilized to bring
the SDN’s principle of separating control and data plane to the
RAN-segment of future cellular systems [229]. Furthermore,
most existing TI related works assume that both the master and
controlled domains are attached to the same wireless network.
However,
the network domain may comprise
different wireless networks, and this demands for suitable SDN
and virtualization-based network architectures to effectively
coordinate among these networks.

in practice,

In order to design effective tactile sensing systems, various
aspects related to sensor hardware such as sensitivity and abil-
ity to measure several parameters, the arrangement of tactile
sensors and the physical issues including spatial resolution and
conformability, need to be addressed. Also, future advances in
nano-technology and fabrication mechanisms are needed to
effectively integrate various sensing units and signal process-
ing modules [12]. In addition to the development of tactile
sensors, it is crucial to develop low-complex and hardware
friendly techniques to process the raw information captured
by these sensors.

In terms of computation in TI applications, the main chal-
lenges include [151]: (i) online processing of haptic feedback
for near real-time interactions, (ii) in-ﬁeld processing to reduce
ingress transmissions, and (iii) support of computationally
intensive AI processing and training at the tactile edge. One
of the promising approaches for enhancing the computational
capacity per unit area could be highly adaptive energy-efﬁcient
computing box vision, which can contain over 109 computing
nodes within a 10 cm3 space [230], and which relies on ultra-
short range optical wireless communication between chips
inside a cluster of computing nodes.

G. Joint Design of Control and Communication Systems

Most of TI systems need the fusion of control and com-
munication systems to meet the desired requirements in terms
of latency, reliability and system’s stability. In this regard, it
is necessary to design communication network protocols for
achieving real-time performance and also to design suitable
control algorithms to compensate the imperfections introduced
by the communication medium [48]. These aspects have been
independently handled by the communications and control the-
ory research communities, but sufﬁcient interactions between
these two communities are currently missing. In this direction,
it
to have an integrated approach to optimize
the network-aware control and control-aware network with
sufﬁcient interactions between the two research communities.
Furthermore, maximizing the user’s QoE while concurrently
guaranteeing the stable global control loop in the presence
of time-varying communication delay is one major challenge
to be addressed in the networked teleoperation system with
the haptic feedback. This will require the investigation of
suitable dynamic control switching strategies for teleoperation
systems for maximizing the QoE in the presence of time-
varying communications delay [190].

is crucial

Furthermore, in vehicular platooning communications, it is
essential to get the real-time information from the neighbor-
ing vehicles via inter-vehicle communications, and also to
employ a suitable control law to achieve the objective of
obtaining inter-vehicle spacing within the same platoon [231].
To achieve this goal, one of the future directions could be
to investigate a joint design of advanced control mechanisms
and efﬁcient IVC protocol for the safety and stability of
cooperative driving, and also for the reliable delivery of the
required information with low latency.

H. Advanced Signal Processing and ML for TI

The signals generated by the tactile sensors are usually
noisy, complex with higher dimensions, and include much
unnecessary information [232]. Therefore, it is crucial to inves-
tigate advanced signal processing techniques to process such
complex and multi-dimensional signals and low-complexity
ML techniques to extract meaningful information from the
raw data acquired by the tactile sensors.

To address the issues of high complexity (bad models),
inefﬁcient computation and slow convergence, AI/ML has
been attracting a lot of attention in the wireless community
and also it seems very promising for TI applications. How-
ever, various challenges due to fast time-varying channels,
short stationary interval, distributed data and limitations on
comptuation/energy, need to be addressed. In haptic communi-
cations over TI, it is challenging to have stable haptic control
due to time-varying wireless channel. In this regard, one of
the promising approaches is to utilize the recently emerging
concept of edge intelligence at the edge of TI networks. With
the help of edge caching and user-speciﬁc trafﬁc management,
congestion as well as the latency of haptic communications
can be reduced [54]. Also, by employing various emerging
ML/deep learning techniques [113], suitable predictive and
extrapolative/interpolative ML modules can be employed near

the edge of the network. With the help of such ML-enabled
TI support engines, the stability of haptic communications
can be enhanced and also the fundamental limitation caused
by the ﬁnite speed of light can be overcomed, thus enabling
high communication range between two tactile ends [54].
Furthermore, hybrid models which may combine both the data-
driven and model-driven paradigms should be exploited for
future B5G TI applications.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

Future Beyond 5G wireless networks are expected to sup-
port a broad variety of emerging TI applications having
diverse QoS requirements. For this, several non-conventional
challenges resulted due to the need of communicating haptic
information in addition to the conventional audio and visual
trafﬁcs over wireless media have to be addressed. The main
technical requirements in this regard include ultra-low latency,
ultra-high reliability, very high data-rate, energy efﬁciency,
spectral efﬁciency and network throughput. To this end, start-
ing with the vision of TI and recent advances, this survey
paper has presented a generalized framework for wireless TI
comprising the main technical requirements, key application
areas, a TI architecture and the main enabling technologies,
and has provided a comprehensive survey on various aspects
of wireless TI. Three main paradigms of TI, namely, haptic
communications, wireless AR/VR and autonomous, intelligent
and cooperative mobility systems have been extensively dis-
cussed, along with the existing state-of-the-art review, the main
challenges and potential enablers. Furthermore, key enablers
for supporting TI applications/users in B5G systems have been
identiﬁed and discussed along with the main sub-techniques.
Moreover, considering security and privacy as important as-
pects of the TI deployment, existing related works have been
reviewed along with the promising enablers. Finally, some
important research issues and interesting recommendations for
future research directions have been provided.
