Abstract—Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems
can provide high data rates but the system performance may
degrade signiﬁcantly due to mobile blockers and the user’s own
body. A high frequency of interruptions and long duration of
blockage may degrade the quality of experience. For example,
delays of more than about 10ms cause nausea to VR viewers.
Macro-diversity of base stations (BSs) has been considered a
promising solution where the user equipment (UE) can handover
to other available BSs, if the current serving BS gets blocked.
However, an analytical model for the frequency and duration of
dynamic blockage events in this setting is largely unknown. In this
paper, we consider an open park-like scenario and obtain closed-
form expressions for the blockage probability, expected frequency
and duration of blockage events using stochastic geometry. Our
results indicate that the minimum density of BS that is required
to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of AR/VR
and other low latency applications is largely driven by blockage
events rather than capacity requirements. Placing the BS at a
greater height reduces the likelihood of blockage. We present a
closed-form expression for the BS density-height trade-off that
can be used for network planning.

I. INTRODUCTION

Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems can
provide high data rates of the order of a few Gbps [1],
suitable for the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for
Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). For these
applications, the user-equipment (UE) requires the data rate to
be in the range of 100 Mbps to a few Gbps, and an end-to-end
latency in the range of 1 ms to 10 ms [2]. However, mmWave
communication systems are quite vulnerable to blockages
due to higher penetration losses and reduced diffraction [3].
Even the human body can reduce the signal strength by 20
dB [4]. Thus, an unblocked Line of Sight (LOS) link is highly
desirable for mmWave systems. Furthermore, a mobile human
blocker can block the LOS path between User Equipment
(UE) and Base Station (BS) for approximately 500 ms [4].
The frequent blockages of mmWave LOS links and a high
blockage duration can be detrimental
to ultra-reliable and
ultra-low latency applications.

One potential solution to blockages in the mmWave cellu-
lar network can be macro-diversity of BSs and coordinated
multipoint (CoMP) techniques. These techniques have shown
a signiﬁcant reduction in interference and improvement in
reliability, coverage, and capacity in the current Long Term
Evolution-Advance (LTE-A) deployments and other commu-
nication networks [5]. Furthermore, Radio Access Networks
(RANs) are moving towards the cloud-RAN architecture that

implements macro-diversity and CoMP techniques by pooling
a large number of BSs in a single centralized baseband unit
(BBU) [6], [7]. As a single centralized BBU handles multiple
BSs, the handover and beam-steering time can be reduced
signiﬁcantly [8]. In order to provide seamless connectivity for
ultra-reliable and ultra-low latency applications, the proposed
5G mmWave cellular architecture needs to consider key QoS
parameters such as the probability of blockage events, the fre-
quency of blockages, and the blockage duration. For instance,
to satisfy the QoS requirement of mission-critical applications
such as AR/VR, tactile Internet, and eHealth applications, 5G
cellular networks target a service reliability of 99.999% [9].
In general, the service interruption due to blockage events can
be alleviated by caching the downlink contents at the BSs or
the network edge [10]. However, caching the content more
than about 10ms may degrade the user experience and may
cause nausea to the users particularly for AR applications [11].
An alternative when blocked is to ofﬂoad trafﬁc to sub-6GHz
networks such as 4G, but this needs to be carefully engineered
so as to not overload them. Therefore, it is important to study
the blockage probability, blockage frequency, and blockage
duration to satisfy the desired QoS requirements.

This work presents a simple blockage model for the LOS
link using tools from stochastic geometry. In particular, our
contributions are as follow:

1) We provide an analytical model for dynamic blockage
(UE blocked by mobile blockers) and self-blockage (UE
blocked by the user’s own body). The expression for the
rate of blockage of LOS link is evaluated as a function
of the blocker density, velocity, height and link length.
2) We evaluate the closed-form probability and expected
frequency of simultaneous blockage of all BSs in the
range of the UE. Further, we present an approximation
for the expected duration of simultaneous blockage.
3) We verify our analytical results through Monte-Carlo
simulations by considering a random way-point mobility
model for blockers.

4) Finally, we present a case study to ﬁnd the minimum
required BS density for speciﬁc mission-critical services
and analyze the trade-off between BS height and density
to satisfy the QoS requirements.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The related
work is presented in Section II, and the system model is
described in Section III. Section IV provides an analysis of
blockage events and evaluates the key blockage metrics. The
validation of our theoretical results with MATLAB simulations

 
 
 
 
 
 
is presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the
paper.

II. RELATED WORK

A mmWave link may have three kinds of blockages, namely,
static, dynamic, and self-blockage. Static blockage due to
buildings and permanent structures has been studied in [12]
and [13] using random shape theory and a stochastic geom-
etry approach for urban microwave systems. The underlying
static blockage model is incorporated into the cellular system
coverage and rate analysis in [3]. Static blockage may cause
permanent blockage of the LOS link. However, for an open
area such as a public park, static blockages play a small
role. The second type of blockage is dynamic blockage due
to mobile humans and vehicles (collectively called mobile
blockers) which may cause frequent interruptions to the LOS
link. Dynamic blockage has been given signiﬁcant importance
by 3GPP in TR 38.901 of Release 14 [14]. An analytical model
in [15] considers a single access point, a stationary user, and
blockers located randomly in an area. The model in [16] is
developed for a speciﬁc scenario of a road intersection using a
Manhattan Poisson point process model. MacCartney et al. [4]
developed a Markov model for blockage events based on
measurements on a single BS-UE link. Similarly, Raghavan et
al. [17] ﬁts the blockage measurements with various statistical
models. However, a model based on experimental analysis is
very speciﬁc to the measurement scenario. The authors in [18]
considered a 3D blockage model and analyzed the blocker
arrival probability for a single BS-UE pair. Studies of spatial
correlation and temporal variation in blockage events for a
single BS-UE link are presented in [19] and [20]. However,
their analytical model is not easily scalable to multiple BSs,
important when considering the impact of macro-diversity..

Apart from static and dynamic blockage, self-blockage plays
a key role in mmWave performance. The authors of [21]
studied human body blockage through simulation. A statistical
self-blockage model is developed in [17] through experiments
considering various modes (landscape or portrait) of hand-
held devices. The impact of self-blockage on received signal
strength is studied in [13] through a stochastic geometry
model. They assume the self-blockage due to a user’s body
blocks the BSs in an area represented by a cone.

All the above blockage models consider the UE’s associa-
tion with a single BS. Macro-diversity of BSs is considered as
a potential solution to alleviate the effect of blockage events in
a cellular network. The authors of [22] and [23] proposed an
architecture for macro-diversity with multiple BSs and showed
the improvement in network throughput. A blockage model
with macro-diversity is developed in [24] for independent
blocking and in [25] for correlated blocking. However, they
consider only static blockage due to buildings.

cations such as AR/VR. In this paper, we present a simple
closed-form expression for a compact analysis to provide
insight
into the optimal density, height and other design
parameters and trade-offs of BS deployment.

III. SYSTEM MODEL

Our system model consists of the following settings:

•

•

•

•

BS Model: The mmWave BS locations are modeled as a
homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP) with density
λT . Consider a disc B(o, R) of radius R and centered
around the origin o, where a typical UE is located. We
assume that each BS in B(o, R) is a potential serving
BS for the UE. Thus, the number of BSs M in the disc
B(o, R) of area πR2 follows a Poisson distribution with
parameter λT πR2, i.e.,

.

Given the number of BSs m in the disc B(o, R), we
have a uniform probability distribution for BS locations.
The BSs distances
i = 1, . . . , m from the UE
are independent and identically distributed (iid) with

Self-blockage Model: The user blocks a fraction of BSs
due to his/her own body. The self-blockage zone is
deﬁned as a sector of the disc B(o, R) making an angle
ω towards the user’s body as shown in Figure 1(a). Thus,
all of the BSs in the self-blockage zone are considered
blocked.
Dynamic Blockage Model: The blockers are distributed
according to a homogeneous PPP with parameter λB.
Further, the arrival process of the blockers crossing the
ith BS-UE link is Poisson with intensity αi. The blockage
duration is independent of the blocker arrival process and
is exponentially distributed with parameter µ.
Connectivity Model: We say the UE is blocked when
all of the potential serving BSs in the disc B(o, R) are
blocked simultaneously.

The primary purpose of the blockage models in previous
papers was to study the coverage and capacity analysis of the
mmWave system. However, apart from the signal degradation,
blockage frequency and duration also affects the performance

For a sound understanding of the system model, consider a
single BS-UE LOS link in Figure 1(a). The distance between
the ith BS and the UE is ri and the LOS link makes an angle
θ with respect to the positive x-axis. Further, the blockers in

the positive x-axis, where ϕ

Following [20], we model the blocker arrival process as
Poisson with parameter αi blockers/sec (bl/s). Note that there
can be more than one blocker simultaneously blocking the
LOS link. The overall blocking process has been modeled
in [20] as an alternating renewal process with alternate periods
of blocked/unblocked intervals, where the distribution of the
blocked interval is obtained as the busy period distribution of
a general M/GI/
system. For mathematical simplicity, we
assume the blockage duration of a single blocker is exponen-
tially distributed with parameter µ, thus, forming an M/M/
∞
queuing system. We further approximate the overall blockage
process as an alternating renewal process with exponentially
distributed periods of blocked and unblocked intervals with
parameters αi and µ respectively. This approximation works
for a wide range of blocker densities as shown in Section V.
In the next section, we consider a generalized blockage
model for M BSs which are in the range of the UE. The
UE keeps track of all these M BSs using beam-tracking and

handover techniques. Since the handover process is assumed
to be very fast, we assume that the UE can instantaneously
connect to any unblocked BS when the current serving BS
gets blocked. Therefore, we consider the total blockage event
occurs only when all the potential serving BSs are blocked.

IV. ANALYSIS OF BLOCKAGE EVENTS

A. Coverage Probability under Self-blockage

Let there be N BSs out of total M BSs within the range of
the UE that are not blocked by self-blockage. The distribution
of the number of BSs (N ) outside the self-blockage zone and
in the disc B(o, R) is

would be pπR2). Let

at least one serving BS in the disc B(o, R) and outside the
self-blockage zone, i.e., N

Given that there are n BSs in the communication range
of the UE and are not blocked by the user’s body,
they
can still get blocked by mobile blockers. The blocking event
of these n BS-UE links is assumed to be independent on-
off processes with αi and µ as blocking and unblocking
rates, respectively. The probability of blockage of the ith
BS-UE link is αi/(αi + µ). Our objective is to develop a
blockage model for the mmWave cellular system where UE
can connect to any of the potential serving BSs. In this setting
the blockage occurs when all the BS-UE links are blocked
simultaneously. We deﬁne an indicator random variable B that
indicates the blockage of all available BSs in the range of
UE. The blockage probability P (B
) is conditioned
on the number of BSs N in the disc B(o, R) which are not
blocked by the user’s body and the link lengths

V. NUMERICAL EVALUATION

∼

This section compares our analytical results with MATLAB
simulation1 where the movement of blockers is generated
using the random waypoint mobility model [26], [27]. For the
simulation, we consider a rectangular box of 200 m
200 m
and blockers are located uniformly in this area. Our area
of interest is the disc B(o, R) of radius R = 100m, which
perfectly ﬁts in the considered rectangular area. The blockers
chose a direction randomly, and move in that direction for a
Unif[0, 60] sec. To maintain the density
time-duration of t
of blockers in the rectangular region, we consider that once a
blocker reaches the edge of the rectangle, they get reﬂected.
We consider two values of mobile blocker density, 0.01
and 0.1 bl/m2, and two values of the self-blocking angle ω
(0 and π/3) for our study. Figures 2, 3, and 4 present the
statistics of blockages when the UE has at least one serving
BS, i.e., the UE is always in the coverage area of at least
one BS. From Figure 2 and Figure 3, we can observe that
the blockage probability and the expected blockage frequency
decrease exponentially with BS density. From the point of
view of interactive applications such as AR/VR, video con-
ferencing, online gaming, and others, this means that a higher
BS density can potentially decrease interruptions in the data
transmission. For example, for a blocker density of 0.1 bl/m2, a
BS density of 100/km2 can decrease the interruptions to once
in ten seconds, 200/km2 can decrease them to once in 100
seconds, and 300/km2 decrease them to once in 1000 seconds.
Reducing the frequency of interruptions is particularly crucial
for AR/VR applications,
therefore from this perspective a
density of 200-300/km2 may be required. This corresponds
to about 6 to 9 BS, respectively, within the range of each
UE. From Figure 4, we can observe that caching of 100
ms worth of data is required for a BS density 200/km2 to
have uninterrupted services. For AR and tactile applications,
caching is not a solution and a delay of 100 ms may be an
unacceptable delay. Switching to microwave networks such

as 4G during blockage events may be an alternative solution
instead of deploying a high BS density, but then this may
need careful network planning so as to not overload the
4G network. The amount of required cached data decreases
with increasing BS density. A BS density of 300/km2 and
500/km2 can bring down the required cached data to 60 ms
and 40 ms, respectively. This may be acceptable for AR/VR
applications if these freezes are infrequent. Thus, the cellular
architecture needs to consider the optimal amount of cached
data and the optimal BS density needed to mitigate the effect
of these occasional high blockage durations to satisfy QoS
requirements for AR/VR application without creating nausea.
A tentative conclusion is that perhaps a minimum acceptable
density of 300/km2 (which corresponds to about 9 BS within
range of each UE) is needed to keep interruptions lasting about
60 ms to once every 1000 seconds.

We also observe that both simulation and analytical results
are approximately the same for a low blocker density of 0.01
bl/m2. From Figure 4, we observe our analytical result deviates
from the simulation result for lower values of BS densities.

BS density required for a maximum blockage probability

of 0.01 bl/m2 and self-blockage angle of 60o. For a higher
blocker density, the required BS density increases linearly.
Note that this again imposes a higher BS density than would
be necessary from most models based solely on capacity needs
(roughly 100 BS/km2 [1]).

The BS height vs. density trade-off is shown in Figure 5.
Note, for example, that doubling the height of the BS from
4m to 8 m reduces the BS station density requirement by
approximately 20%. The optimal BS height and density can
be obtained by performing a cost analysis.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we presented a simpliﬁed model for the key
QoS parameters such as blockage probability, frequency, and
duration in mmWave cellular systems. Our model considered
an open park-like area with dynamic blockage due to mobile
blockers and self-blockage due to user’s own body. We have
not considered Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) paths for such an
environment, but it will be included in future work. The user
is considered blocked when all potential BSs around the UE
are blocked simultaneously. We veriﬁed our theoretical model

with MATLAB simulations considering the random waypoint
mobility model for blockers. Our results tentatively show that
the density of BS required to provide acceptable quality of
experience to AR/VR applications is much higher than that
obtained by capacity requirements alone. This suggests that the
mmWave cellular networks may be blockage limited instead
of capacity limited. We also plan to study blockage effects in
networks with hexagonal cells in our future work.
