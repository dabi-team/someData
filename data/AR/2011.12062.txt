ABSTRACT

A long-standing problem is to predict the future ﬂare productivity of an active region (AR)
when it is on the stage of early emergence. The aim of this study is to probe two parameters
of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld, both derived during the emergence phase of an AR, and
to compare them with the ﬂare productivity of the well-developed AR. The parameters are:
(i) the index of the magnetic power spectrum (the slope of the spectrum) on the stage of
emergence, and (ii) the ﬂux emergence rate. Analysis of 243 emerging ARs showed that the
magnetic power index increases from values typical for quiet-Sun regions to the values typical
for mature ARs within a day while the emergence proceeds for several days; frequently, after
the increase, the value of the power index undulates around some mean value with ﬂuctuations
being several time less than the growth of the power index during the emergence onset. For a
subset of 34 ﬂare-productive ARs we found no correlation between the power spectrum index
at the stage of emergence and ﬂare index derived from the entire interval of the AR’s presence
on the disc. At the same time, the ﬂux emergence rate correlates well with the ﬂare index
(the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient is 0.74). We conclude that high ﬂux emergence rate is a
necessary condition for an AR to produce strong ﬂares in the future, and so, the ﬂux emergence
rate can be used to probe the future ﬂare productivity of the AR.

1 INTRODUCTION

The solar physics community puts great eﬀorts into development of
approaches capable to predict solar activity on long term (month-
years) time scales and solar ﬂares on short term (hours-days) time
scales. Solar ﬂares – intense explosive releases of electromagnetic
radiation – mostly take place in active regions (ARs). The energy
that feeds solar ﬂares is assumed to be stored in an AR in the
form of the so-called ‘free’ magnetic energy (e.g. Melrose 1991;
Schrĳver, et al. 2005). This energy is accumulated in the corona
due to non-potentiality of AR’s magnetic ﬁeld. It is supposed that
the energy release takes place as a consequence of magnetic lines
reconnections in the corona.

However, in the most of the cases, only data on photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld and continuum intensity are readily available for ﬂare
forecast. That is why the majority of ﬂare prediction methods are
based on the statistical correlation between AR parameters (usually
derived from line-of-sight (LOS) or vector magnetograms measured
at the photosphere level) and ﬂare productivity. These parameters
are the total vertical electric current (Leka & Barnes 2007), mag-
netic ﬂux near strong-gradient polarity inversion lines (Schrĳver
2007; Falconer, Moore & Gary 2008), fractal dimension measure of

an AR (McAteer, Gallagher & Ireland 2005), multifractality spec-
trum (Abramenko 2005a), the degree of non-neutralization of ver-
tical electric current within an AR (Kontogiannis, et al. 2017), and
many others. More than a dozen of AR’s parameters that were shown
to be related to solar ﬂare appearance (e.g Leka & Barnes 2003,
2007, and references therein) are routinely calculated in real-time
for Space-Weather Active Region Patches (SHARPs, Bobra et al.
2014) observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI, Schou et al. 2012).
These data are arguably appropriate inputs for real-time solar ﬂare
predictions (e.g. Lee, Park & Moon 2018).

Although a number of parameters derived from photospheric
vector magnetic ﬁeld exhibits mutual correlation with the ﬂare pro-
ductivity of an AR, Leka & Barnes (2007) argued that the state
of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld at a given time provides lim-
ited information on whether the AR will produce a ﬂare. It is
worth noting that more recent approaches intend to add all the
available data including chromospheric and coronal intensity maps
in the forecast model (e.g. Jonas, et al. 2018). A variety of other
methods such as machine learning (e.g. Bobra & Couvidat 2015;
Liu, et al. 2017; Raboonik, et al. 2017), analyses of AR morphol-
ogy (e.g. McIntosh 1990; Bloomﬁeld, et al. 2012), ﬂare statistics
(e.g. Wheatland 2004), radio emission ﬂuxes (e.g. Tanaka & Enome

A. S. Kutsenko et al.

1975; Bogod, et al. 2018) are also widely used to solve the ﬂare pre-
diction problem.

The list of ﬂare forecast approaches mentioned above is
far from being a comprehensive one. Barnes, et al. (2016) and
Leka, et al. (2019) compared the performance of currently operating
solar ﬂare prediction algorithms (see the list of currently operating
algorithms in table 1 in Leka, et al. 2019). They concluded that the
performance of diﬀerent algorithms is quite comparable, i.e. there
is no algorithm that performs much better than others. In the most
of the cases the algorithms make their forecasts for a time interval
of 24–48 h. The data on well-developed AR are usually required
to calculate ﬂare-related parameters used in most algorithms. For
example, one can not estimate the vertical current along the polarity
inversion line in emerging AR if this inversion line is not formed
yet. Is there a property or parameter of an AR that can be used to
predict AR’s ﬂare productivity in advance, say, as soon as the AR
starts to emerge? Can we use this parameter to conclude that the AR
is ‘born-bad’, i.e., it is capable to produce strong ﬂares in the future?
Alternatively, can we reveal ‘quiet’ ARs during early stages of their
emergence? We suppose that at least two parameters that can be
estimated during early stages of emergence of an AR – the index of
the magnetic power spectrum (power index) and the ﬂux emergence
rate – might be predictors for the future ﬂare productivity.

Abramenko (2005b) found a statistical relationship between
the time-averaged power index – the negative slope of the magnetic
power spectrum – of a well-developed AR and its ﬂare productivity
derived from the entire time interval when the AR was on the so-
lar disc. High-resolution magnetograms acquired by the Michelson
Doppler Interferometer on board the Solar and Heliospheric Obser-
vatory (SOHO/MDI Scherrer et al. 1995) were used to derive the
power spectra and power indices for 16 ARs. Abramenko (2005b)
showed that the power index tends to increase for ARs with higher
ﬂare productivity. Much more solid set of 217 ARs was considered
by Abramenko & Yurchyshyn (2010). The ARs were observed by
SOHO/MDI between 1997 and 2006 and were divided into well-
developed, emerging, decaying, and unipolar ARs subsets. The au-
thors conﬁrmed positive correlation between the power index and
the ﬂare productivity of an AR with Pearson’s 𝜌 = 0.57. Unipolar
spots exhibited the lowest values of both the ﬂare index and the
power index. No segregation between the subsets of emerging and
decaying ARs was found.

spectra of 53 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. The ARs were divided
into two subsets of ﬂare-quiet and ﬂare-productive (produced at
least one M1 class ﬂare) ARs. The analysis showed that 90% of
ﬂare-productive ARs and only 12% of ﬂare-quiet ARs exhibited the
power index greater than 2. The authors also argued that ﬂare-quiet
ARs may exhibit high day-to-day variations of the power index
while the power index of ﬂare-productive ARs remains stable
at relatively high level days before and days after ﬂare events.
Mandage & McAteer (2016) concluded that the power index can
be employed to forecast ﬂares several days in advance.

Findings

(2005b)

Previous studies of the power index and ﬂare productivity in
ARs used data for predominantly well-developed ARs. Although
6 out of 16 ARs studied in Abramenko (2005b) were classiﬁed as
emerging ARs, none of them was tracked since the very beginning
of the emergence. Instead, SOHO/MDI started to observe an AR in a
high-resolution mode as soon as the clear emergence of the magnetic
ﬂux was detected. Interestingly, the power index retrieved from the
ﬁrst provided magnetogram was quite close to those calculated from

magnetograms of the AR in a well-developed state. In general, the
power index seems to increase abruptly as soon as an AR starts to
emerge (Abramenko 2005b). Hewett et al. (2008) studied the power
index temporal evolution of NOAA AR 10488. They found the rapid
change of the power index from 0.5 to 2.5 within a day (see ﬁg. 8
in Hewett et al. 2008). Kutsenko, Kutsenko & Abramenko (2019)
analysed power index variations in four emerging ARs. All of them
exhibited abrupt increase of the power index as soon as ﬁrst imprints
of magnetic ﬂux appeared on the photosphere. An important point
is that the observed value of the power index was typical for mature
ARs and changed insigniﬁcantly during further evolution of the
ARs.

One more AR parameter

that can be estimated on
the early stages of emerging is the ﬂux emergence rate.
Canﬁeld, Priest, & Rust (1975) suggested the appearance of solar
ﬂare to be often related to the interaction between old and new
emerging magnetic ﬂuxes. This was later supported by Fu & Welsch
(2016) who concluded that the emergence of a new AR in the vicin-
ity of pre-existed ones is associated with the increase of strong ﬂares
occurrence. Fast-emerging ARs may disturb a pre-existed magnetic
conﬁguration and initiate magnetic reconnections and eruptions
(Archontis & Syntelis 2019). Thus, Schrĳver (2009) summarized
that the emergence of a highly-twisted magnetic ﬂux bundle into
pre-existed strong magnetic surroundings leads to strong ﬂares. In
addition, Golovko (1986) and Ishkov (2003) argued that high-rate
magnetic ﬂux emergence often results in the formation of structures
with high magnetic ﬁeld gradients that tend to erupt. These ﬁnd-
ings were recently supported by numerical simulations performed
by Toriumi & Takasao (2017). The authors concluded that complex
magnetic 𝛿-spot structures producing the largest X-class ﬂares are
formed due to interaction of several emerging magnetic ﬂux loops
or due to emergence of a highly-twisted magnetic ﬂux bundle.

The ﬂux emergence rate is in general proportional to the
peak magnetic ﬂux of an AR (e.g. Otsuji, et al. 2011; Norton, et al.
2017; Kutsenko, Abramenko & Pevtsov 2019). However, ARs with
similar peak magnetic ﬂux may exhibit signiﬁcant variations of
the ﬂux emergence rate (Abramenko, et al. 2017). Our analy-
sis of time proﬁles of the ﬂux emergence rate performed in
Kutsenko, Abramenko & Pevtsov (2019) suggested that ARs often
emerge monotonously at a constant rate. Hence, we suppose that
the ﬂux emergence rate can be estimated on the stage of early emer-
gence.

The aim of this work is to ﬁnd out whether the power index
and the ﬂux emergence rate derived during the early stages of the
emergence can be used to predict the ﬂare productivity of ARs in
the future. To achieve the goal, we intend (i) to analyse temporal
variations of the power index of a statistically signiﬁcant set of
emerging ARs, and (ii) to explore a relationship between each of
our parameters and ﬂare productivity.

2 DATA AND METHODS

The data set for 423 emerging ARs prepared previously in
Kutsenko, Abramenko & Pevtsov (2019) was utilized as a basis in
this study. For each AR the data set contains a time series of patches
extracted from full-disc LOS magnetograms acquired by SDO/HMI.
The patches represent the magnetic ﬁeld maps of isolated emerging
ARs as well as magnetic ﬁeld maps of the quiet Sun these ARs
emerge from. Each AR was tracked as long as the centre of the
patch was located within 60◦ from the central meridian. Both the
emergence onset and the peak total unsigned magnetic ﬂux were ob-

MNRAS 000, 1–7 (2020)

served within these longitudinal ranges. A number of parameters,
such as the peak total unsigned magnetic ﬂux, ﬂux emergence rate,
time of the emergence onset and of the emergence halt, are gath-
ered in the data set (see Kutsenko, Abramenko & Pevtsov 2019,
for details). The total unsigned magnetic ﬂux was calculated as a
sum of absolute magnetic ﬂux density values in LOS magnetogram
pixels multiplied by the projection-corrected pixel area. Only pix-
els with absolute magnetic ﬂux density above 18 Mx cm−2 (triple
noise level in 720-s LOS SDO/HMI magnetograms as measured by
Liu et al. 2012) were used in the summation. Before summation,
the 𝜇-correction was applied to each pixel in the magnetograms
(Leka, Barnes, & Wagner 2017).

From the entire data set, we selected only ARs with assigned
NOAA number and with the peak total unsigned magnetic ﬂux
between 0.6×1021 and 26×1021 Mx. The resulting subset consisting
of 243 ARs was analysed in this study. The list of the ARs and the
derived parameters described below are listed in Table 1. The full
table is attached to this article as a supplementary material. For
each NOAA AR, we calculated the magnetic power spectrum of the
LOS magnetic ﬁeld component. The procedure was developed in
Abramenko et al. (2001) and was described in detail in Abramenko
(2005b). Brieﬂy, a two-dimensional (2D) Fast Fourier Transform is
applied to observed LOS magnetograms acquired at time 𝑡 yielding
2D spectra. An integration of the spectrum power over thin anulus
between two concentric rings centred at the origin of the 2D-space
of wavenumbers is performed to retrieve the 1D power spectrum
𝐸 (𝑘, 𝑡), where 𝑘 = 2𝜋/𝑟 is the wavenumber and 𝑟 is the spatial
scale in Mm. An example of the power spectrum evolution for
NOAA AR 12219 is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. An important
characteristic of a power spectrum is its slope. Throughout this paper
we will refer to the negative slope of the power spectrum as the power
index, 𝛼. The power index depends on the turbulent regime, i.e., on
the energy transfer mechanism in the medium where the magnetic
ﬁeld evolves (e.g. Kolmogorov 1941; Biskamp 1993). Thus, the
power index of quiet-Sun regions is of about 1.0 while that of AR
ranges between 1.5 and 2.5. The power index is usually measured
by ﬁtting the power spectrum by a linear approximation within the
inertial range. The inertial range is the range of wavenumbers where
the spectrum is linear in a double logarithmic plot and a relationship
𝐸 (𝑘, 𝑡) ∝ 𝑘−𝛼 holds. The low-frequency (large-scale) limit of the
inertial range relies on the scale where the dominant energy injection
occurs (injection range). Thus, Mandage & McAteer (2016) argued
that this limit may depend on the size of magnetic elements in the
AR. The high-frequency (low-scale) limit is determined either by
the dissipation, or, as in our case, by the (triple) spatial resolution
of the telescope (Abramenko et al. 2001). Since we analyse both
quiet-Sun and AR patches, in order to achieve the homogeneity of
the measured power index we follow Abramenko (2005b) and deﬁne
the inertial range to be between 2.4 and 10 Mm (Fig. 1).

Time variations of the power index, 𝛼(𝑡), and of the total
unsigned magnetic ﬂux, Φ(𝑡), in NOAA AR 12219 are shown in
the middle panel of Fig. 1. An abrupt increase of the power index
is clearly seen just after the emergence onset while the total un-
signed magnetic ﬂux exhibits relatively gradual growth (cf. ﬁg. 3 in
Kutsenko, Kutsenko & Abramenko 2019). Magnetic power spectra
for three times labelled 𝑡0, 𝑡 𝛼, and 𝑡Φ are shown in the left panel of
Fig. 1. The time 𝑡0 corresponds to the emergence onset when both
power index and magnetic ﬂux start to increase. The spectrum at
𝑡0 has a shallow slope of about -1, which is typical for quiet Sun.
As the emergence proceeds an injection of magnetic energy occurs
at all spatial scales. However, the energy injection on larger scales
prevails resulting in the steepening of the spectrum. The power in-

dex saturates at time 𝑡 𝛼 and ﬂuctuates insigniﬁcantly around some
mean value during further emergence (the ﬂuctuations are several
times less in magnitude than the total increase of the power in-
dex during the emergence). Interestingly, by this time only ﬁrst
imprints of emerging AR are seen in the magnetogram (Fig. 1,
right top panel). The energy growth proceeds on all spatial scales
due to emergence of large magnetic elements and/or simultaneous
emergence and merging of smaller magnetic features (Hewett et al.
2008; Kutsenko, Kutsenko & Abramenko 2019). Although the total
energy increases (the spectrum moves upward, see the left panel in
Fig. 1), the slope of the spectrum changes insigniﬁcantly. The upper
spectrum in the left panel of Fig. 1 corresponds to the time of the
peak magnetic ﬂux, 𝑡Φ.

Using the data on time variations of the power index and of the
total magnetic ﬂux for each AR, we calculated a set of parameters:

(i) The time of the emergence onset, 𝑡0, and the time of the power
index saturation, 𝑡 𝛼. These times were determined by two ﬁttings of
the 𝛼(𝑡) curve with two-segment piece-wise linear functions (shown
in green and orange lines in the middle panel of Fig. 1). For each
ﬁtting, one segment was required to be horizontal while the other
could have arbitrary slope. The desired time point was deﬁned as
an intersection of the horizontal and inclined segments.

(ii) The time of the peak total unsigned magnetic ﬂux, 𝑡Φ was
similarly determined by ﬁtting the Φ(𝑡) curve with a two-segment
piece-wise linear function (marked with purple lines in the middle
panel of Fig. 1).

(iii) Saturated power index 𝛼𝑠𝑎𝑡 was deﬁned as the mean value
of the power index over the [𝑡 𝛼; 𝑡 𝛼 + 1ℎ] interval. Recall that the
inertial range was set to 2.7–10 Mm. Consequently, only magnetic
elements larger than 2.7 Mm may contribute to the slope of the
power spectrum. The characteristic lifetime of such elements is of
order of hours. Therefore, we suppose that the calculation of the
saturated power index as the mean value of the power index within
1-hour interval is reasonable. The uncertainty in the saturated power
index, 𝜎𝛼𝑠𝑎𝑡 , was estimated as the standard deviation of the 𝛼𝑠𝑎𝑡
during this 1-hour interval [𝑡 𝛼; 𝑡 𝛼 + 1ℎ]. Note that the small-scale
noise in the magnetograms aﬀects exclusively high-frequency tail
of the power spectrum (beyond the inertial range) and does not
inﬂuence the slope of the power spectrum.

(iv) Mean power index value 𝛼𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 = h𝛼(𝑡)i|𝑡Φ
𝑡𝛼

Similar to pre-
vious item, the uncertainty in the mean power index, 𝜎𝛼𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 , was
estimated as the standard deviation of 𝛼𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 over the [𝑡 𝛼; 𝑡Φ] in-
terval.

(v) Duration of the power index increase Δ𝑡 𝛼 = 𝑡 𝛼 − 𝑡0.
(vi) Duration of the magnetic ﬂux emergence Δ𝑡Φ = 𝑡Φ − 𝑡0.
(vii) Peak total unsigned magnetic ﬂux Φ𝑚𝑎 𝑥 = Φ(𝑡 = 𝑡Φ).
The error in Φ𝑚𝑎 𝑥 was calculated as 𝜎Φ𝑚𝑎𝑥
= Í𝑛 3𝜎𝐵 𝑠, where
3𝜎𝐵=18 Mx cm−2 is the triple noise level in the SDO/HMI magne-
tograms (Liu et al. 2012), 𝑛 is the number of pixels used to calculate
the total unsigned ﬂux at 𝑡 = 𝑡Φ, 𝑠 is a projection-corrected area of
one pixel.

(viii) Flux emergence rate 𝑅𝑎 𝑣 = (Φ𝑚𝑎 𝑥 − Φ(𝑡0))/Δ𝑡Φ. The
uncertainty of the ﬂux emergence rate is proportional to the relative
=
uncertainty of the peak magnetic ﬂux and was estimated as 𝜎𝑅𝑎𝑣
(Φ𝑚𝑎𝑥 −Φ(𝑡0)) · 𝑅𝑎 𝑣.

𝜎Φ𝑚𝑎𝑥

(ix) To evaluate the ﬂare productivity of an AR, we, following
Abramenko (2005b), calculated its ﬂare index (FI). FI is a normal-
ized measure of X-ray radiation emitted by an AR:

FI = (100𝑆 (𝑋) + 10𝑆 ( 𝑀 ) + 1.0𝑆 (𝐶) + 0.1𝑆 (𝐵) )/𝜏,

a certain ﬂare class (𝑋, 𝑀, 𝐶, 𝐵), 𝑁 𝑗
is the number of ﬂares
of a certain class, and 𝜏 is the total time interval of AR ob-
servation in days (Abramenko 2005b). The data on FI was pro-
vided by the CrAO Solar Application web resource available at
http://solar.dev.argh.team. The website aggregates data on
ARs and ﬂares from diﬀerent web sources. It provides information
on AR’s ﬁrst and last dates of observation, on the class and power of
the most intense ﬂare produced by the AR, on the duration of the AR
presence on the disc, and on the AR’s ﬂare index. The noise level of
GOES ﬂuxes is of about 2 × 10−8 W m−2 (Aschwanden & Freeland
2012) that is two orders of magnitude less than C1.0 class ﬂare.
Consequently, we suppose that the uncertainties in the ﬂare index
measurements are negligible.

3 RESULTS

In all, among 243 emerging ARs analysed in this study, only 34
of them exhibited the ﬂare index FI equal to or exceeding unity
(at least one C1 class ﬂare per day). We will refer to this 34 ARs
as a set of ﬂaring ARs through the rest of the paper. Such a low
fraction of ﬂare-productive ARs in the set can be explained, ﬁrst,

by low activity of Solar Cycle 24, and, second, by strong selection
rules: both the emergence onset and the peak magnetic ﬂux must
be observed within ±60◦ from the central meridian. In addition, a
majority of newly-emerged ARs were quite weak to produce strong
ﬂares or the ﬂaring might start after the ARs moved to the far-side
of the Sun.

3.1 Temporal evolution of the power index

Duration of the magnetic ﬂux emergence, Δ𝑡Φ, versus duration of
the power index increase, Δ𝑡 𝛼, for the entire data set is shown in
the upper panel of Fig. 2. The plot shows that in the most of the
cases Δ𝑡 𝛼 does not exceed one day (11 h on average) while the ﬂux
emergence may last for several days. Consequently, the value of
saturated power index can be estimated during initial stages of AR’s
emergence. A dotted diagonal line is plotted to emphasize that for
the majority of the cases, the power index increase is faster than the
increase of the total unsigned ﬂux (note also equal axis scales). Red
circles in Fig. 2 indicate the 34 ﬂaring ARs. As one can see, there
is no clear diﬀerence between the distributions of ﬂare-productive
and ﬂare-quiet ARs.

The lower panel of Fig. 2 shows the saturated power index

standard deviations of the power indices described in the previous
section. The Pearson’s linear correlation coeﬃcient of the distri-
bution equals 0.66 while the conﬁdence interval is shown for 95%
conﬁdence level. The corruption of the correlation coeﬃcient due to
uncertainties in the measured data was taken into account using the
technique described in Saccenti, Hendriks, & Smilde (2020). Most
of the data points are concentrated along the diagonal of the plot
suggesting that on average the saturated power index (measured dur-
ing the early stages of emergence) is a good estimator of the power
index observed during the entire duration of emergence.

3.2 Power index and ﬂare productivity of newly-emerged ARs

The relationships between the ﬂare index, FI, and power index values
𝛼𝑠𝑎𝑡 and 𝛼𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 are shown in the top and bottom panels of Fig. 3,
respectively. In these plots we used data on ﬂaring ARs with FI≥ 1.
The plots show the absence of correlation between ﬂare and power
indices. This result might be caused by a speciﬁc choice of ARs in
this work and is discussed in detail in Section 4.

3.3 Flux emergence rate and ﬂare productivity of

newly-emerged ARs

The scatter plots of the ﬂare index FI versus the peak magnetic
ﬂux Φ𝑚𝑎 𝑥 and FI versus the ﬂux emergence rate 𝑅𝑎 𝑣 are shown in
the upper and lower panels of Fig. 4, respectively. The ﬂare index
exhibits a good positive correlation with the peak total unsigned
ﬂux with Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient 𝜌 = 0.67 that is in a
good agreement with previous results (e.g. Leka & Barnes 2007).
The correlation between the ﬂux emergence rate and the ﬂare index
is even better. The Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient 𝜌 reaches 0.74
for the data set of the 34 ﬂaring ARs. Possible implications of this
ﬁnding are discussed in the next section 4. Note, however, that there
are ARs in our set of 243 ARs that exhibited high ﬂux emergence
rate but produced no signiﬁcant ﬂares.

An interesting example of fast-emerging and ﬂare-productive
AR is NOAA AR 12673 that was the most ﬂare-productive AR
in Solar Cycle 24. The AR produced a series of M- and X-class
ﬂares including the strongest X9.3 ﬂare on 2017 September 06 (e.g.
Wang et al. 2018). The AR appeared on the Eastern limb of the solar
disc as a decaying unipolar spot. During the passage across the disc,
an intense emergence of a new magnetic ﬂux started to the East from
the pre-existed sunspot (see Yang et al. 2017, for a morphological
analysis of AR’s evolution). Sun & Norton (2017) found that the
averaged ﬂux emergence rate was 4.93 × 1020 Mx h-1 that was

higher than ever reported previously. Although NOAA AR 12673
did not formally meet our requirements on emerging ARs (this AR
did not appear amidst quiet Sun), we plotted 𝑅𝑎 𝑣 and FI for this one
on the bottom panel of Fig. 4 by a red star symbol. The position of
the star agrees very well with the relationship between the averaged
ﬂux emergence rate and the magnitude of the ﬂare index as derived
from the set of the 34 ﬂaring ARs. Adding this data point to the set of
ﬂaring ARs increases the linear correlation coeﬃcient between 𝑅𝑎 𝑣
and 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐹 𝐼) and yields Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient 𝜌 = 0.82.
This experiment with NOAA AR 12673 allows us to suggest that
a general tendency of the relationship between the ﬂux emergence
rate and the ﬂare index is captured correctly.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We employed SDO/HMI data for 243 emerging ARs to carry out a
statistical analysis of temporal variations of the magnetic spectrum
power index during the emergence of an AR. We found that the
power index starts to increase abruptly as soon as the ﬁrst imprints
of magnetic ﬂux appear on the photosphere. The duration of the

power index growth from values typical for quiet-Sun to higher
values typical for ARs usually does not exceed 1 day. This interval
is several times shorter than the typical duration of magnetic ﬂux
emergence lasting up to 6 days for the largest AR observed in this
study. As the emergence proceeds, the power index usually stabilizes
at values typically observed in well-developed ARs and exhibits just
slight ﬂuctuations (with magnitude being several times less than the
power index increase) throughout the whole process of emergence.
Consequently, in most cases we can evaluate the averaged value of
the power index of a well-developed AR in advance if we observe
the AR since the onset of emergence.

We found no correlation between the power index of emerging
ARs and their future ﬂare productivity. The reason for this negative
result might be our restrict selection rules, and therefore, a scanty
data set, only 34 cases. Besides, the very low activity of Solar
Cycle 24 was the cause for the absence of strong ﬂaring ARs in
our data set. Note that Abramenko (2005b) analysed strong well-
developed ARs of Solar Cycle 23 with a wide range of ﬂare index
ranging from 0 to 130. In the present data set, the highest ﬂare index
magnitude is 41 for NOAA AR 11158, only two ARs exhibit the
ﬂare index exceeding 20 and 5 ARs have ﬂare index exceeding 10.
In ﬁg. 8 in Abramenko (2005b) there is a large scatter of power
indices values (from 1.8 to 2.1) for the range of ﬂare index 10–50
that is in accordance with our results. Seemingly, our restrictions
on emerging ARs do not allow us to include more ﬂare productive
ARs. Indeed, we required both the emergence onset and halt to be
observed within 60◦ from the central meridian, i.e. the total interval
of the AR tracking was limited to approximately 9 days. In that case,
the process of emergence of strong ARs capable to produce strong
ﬂares might not be captured and/or the ﬂaring might start when the
AR rotated to the far-side of the Sun. Summarizing, we conclude
that the power index of the magnetic spectrum, as a predictive
parameter, deserves further investigations based on data for other
solar cycles, more strong than the analysed here Solar Cycle 24.

An interesting result that can have implications for solar ﬂare
forecasting is the relationship between the ﬂare index and the ﬂux
emergence rate of ARs. For the 34 ﬂare-productive ARs (FI ≥ 1) the
logarithm of the ﬂare index was in a good linear correlation with the
ﬂux emergence rate (Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient is 0.74). Note
that in contrast to previous researches mentioned in section 1, in
the present study we considered only isolated ARs emerging amidst
quiet-Sun areas. Our results suggest that fast-emerging ARs tend to
ﬂare even if they emerge into areas with no pre-existed magnetic
ﬂux.

In our data set of 243 ARs there were a lot of rather small ARs
that exhibited high value of ﬂux emergence rate but produced no
signiﬁcant ﬂares. We argue that the high ﬂux emergence rate is a
necessary but not suﬃcient condition for an ARs to produce strong
ﬂares. At the same time, one should keep in mind that at least a part
of ARs with high ﬂux emergence rate start ﬂaring at the far-side of
the Sun after they rotate oﬀ the western limb.

The ﬂux emergence rate measurements might be employed to
make early forecast of AR’s ﬂaring activity. First, the ﬂux emergence
rate can be continuously re-evaluated as the emergence proceeds,
and therefore, the future ﬂare productivity might be continuously
evaluated more precisely. Second, the ﬂux emergence rate is an
easy-to-measure quantity that can be evaluated from, say, ultravio-
let maps of an AR (Schrĳver 1987). This is an advantage of 𝑅𝑎 𝑣
for solar ﬂare forecasting compared to other quantities since emer-
gence rate measurement does not require sophisticated magnetic
ﬁeld data. Thus, Ugarte-Urra et al. (2015) used 304 Å ultraviolet
observations provided by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observa-
