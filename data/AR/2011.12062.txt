ABSTRACT

A long-standing problem is to predict the future Ô¨Çare productivity of an active region (AR)
when it is on the stage of early emergence. The aim of this study is to probe two parameters
of the photospheric magnetic Ô¨Åeld, both derived during the emergence phase of an AR, and
to compare them with the Ô¨Çare productivity of the well-developed AR. The parameters are:
(i) the index of the magnetic power spectrum (the slope of the spectrum) on the stage of
emergence, and (ii) the Ô¨Çux emergence rate. Analysis of 243 emerging ARs showed that the
magnetic power index increases from values typical for quiet-Sun regions to the values typical
for mature ARs within a day while the emergence proceeds for several days; frequently, after
the increase, the value of the power index undulates around some mean value with Ô¨Çuctuations
being several time less than the growth of the power index during the emergence onset. For a
subset of 34 Ô¨Çare-productive ARs we found no correlation between the power spectrum index
at the stage of emergence and Ô¨Çare index derived from the entire interval of the AR‚Äôs presence
on the disc. At the same time, the Ô¨Çux emergence rate correlates well with the Ô¨Çare index
(the Pearson‚Äôs correlation coeÔ¨Écient is 0.74). We conclude that high Ô¨Çux emergence rate is a
necessary condition for an AR to produce strong Ô¨Çares in the future, and so, the Ô¨Çux emergence
rate can be used to probe the future Ô¨Çare productivity of the AR.

1 INTRODUCTION

The solar physics community puts great eÔ¨Äorts into development of
approaches capable to predict solar activity on long term (month-
years) time scales and solar Ô¨Çares on short term (hours-days) time
scales. Solar Ô¨Çares ‚Äì intense explosive releases of electromagnetic
radiation ‚Äì mostly take place in active regions (ARs). The energy
that feeds solar Ô¨Çares is assumed to be stored in an AR in the
form of the so-called ‚Äòfree‚Äô magnetic energy (e.g. Melrose 1991;
Schrƒ≥ver, et al. 2005). This energy is accumulated in the corona
due to non-potentiality of AR‚Äôs magnetic Ô¨Åeld. It is supposed that
the energy release takes place as a consequence of magnetic lines
reconnections in the corona.

However, in the most of the cases, only data on photospheric
magnetic Ô¨Åeld and continuum intensity are readily available for Ô¨Çare
forecast. That is why the majority of Ô¨Çare prediction methods are
based on the statistical correlation between AR parameters (usually
derived from line-of-sight (LOS) or vector magnetograms measured
at the photosphere level) and Ô¨Çare productivity. These parameters
are the total vertical electric current (Leka & Barnes 2007), mag-
netic Ô¨Çux near strong-gradient polarity inversion lines (Schrƒ≥ver
2007; Falconer, Moore & Gary 2008), fractal dimension measure of

an AR (McAteer, Gallagher & Ireland 2005), multifractality spec-
trum (Abramenko 2005a), the degree of non-neutralization of ver-
tical electric current within an AR (Kontogiannis, et al. 2017), and
many others. More than a dozen of AR‚Äôs parameters that were shown
to be related to solar Ô¨Çare appearance (e.g Leka & Barnes 2003,
2007, and references therein) are routinely calculated in real-time
for Space-Weather Active Region Patches (SHARPs, Bobra et al.
2014) observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI, Schou et al. 2012).
These data are arguably appropriate inputs for real-time solar Ô¨Çare
predictions (e.g. Lee, Park & Moon 2018).

Although a number of parameters derived from photospheric
vector magnetic Ô¨Åeld exhibits mutual correlation with the Ô¨Çare pro-
ductivity of an AR, Leka & Barnes (2007) argued that the state
of the photospheric magnetic Ô¨Åeld at a given time provides lim-
ited information on whether the AR will produce a Ô¨Çare. It is
worth noting that more recent approaches intend to add all the
available data including chromospheric and coronal intensity maps
in the forecast model (e.g. Jonas, et al. 2018). A variety of other
methods such as machine learning (e.g. Bobra & Couvidat 2015;
Liu, et al. 2017; Raboonik, et al. 2017), analyses of AR morphol-
ogy (e.g. McIntosh 1990; BloomÔ¨Åeld, et al. 2012), Ô¨Çare statistics
(e.g. Wheatland 2004), radio emission Ô¨Çuxes (e.g. Tanaka & Enome

A. S. Kutsenko et al.

1975; Bogod, et al. 2018) are also widely used to solve the Ô¨Çare pre-
diction problem.

The list of Ô¨Çare forecast approaches mentioned above is
far from being a comprehensive one. Barnes, et al. (2016) and
Leka, et al. (2019) compared the performance of currently operating
solar Ô¨Çare prediction algorithms (see the list of currently operating
algorithms in table 1 in Leka, et al. 2019). They concluded that the
performance of diÔ¨Äerent algorithms is quite comparable, i.e. there
is no algorithm that performs much better than others. In the most
of the cases the algorithms make their forecasts for a time interval
of 24‚Äì48 h. The data on well-developed AR are usually required
to calculate Ô¨Çare-related parameters used in most algorithms. For
example, one can not estimate the vertical current along the polarity
inversion line in emerging AR if this inversion line is not formed
yet. Is there a property or parameter of an AR that can be used to
predict AR‚Äôs Ô¨Çare productivity in advance, say, as soon as the AR
starts to emerge? Can we use this parameter to conclude that the AR
is ‚Äòborn-bad‚Äô, i.e., it is capable to produce strong Ô¨Çares in the future?
Alternatively, can we reveal ‚Äòquiet‚Äô ARs during early stages of their
emergence? We suppose that at least two parameters that can be
estimated during early stages of emergence of an AR ‚Äì the index of
the magnetic power spectrum (power index) and the Ô¨Çux emergence
rate ‚Äì might be predictors for the future Ô¨Çare productivity.

Abramenko (2005b) found a statistical relationship between
the time-averaged power index ‚Äì the negative slope of the magnetic
power spectrum ‚Äì of a well-developed AR and its Ô¨Çare productivity
derived from the entire time interval when the AR was on the so-
lar disc. High-resolution magnetograms acquired by the Michelson
Doppler Interferometer on board the Solar and Heliospheric Obser-
vatory (SOHO/MDI Scherrer et al. 1995) were used to derive the
power spectra and power indices for 16 ARs. Abramenko (2005b)
showed that the power index tends to increase for ARs with higher
Ô¨Çare productivity. Much more solid set of 217 ARs was considered
by Abramenko & Yurchyshyn (2010). The ARs were observed by
SOHO/MDI between 1997 and 2006 and were divided into well-
developed, emerging, decaying, and unipolar ARs subsets. The au-
thors conÔ¨Årmed positive correlation between the power index and
the Ô¨Çare productivity of an AR with Pearson‚Äôs ùúå = 0.57. Unipolar
spots exhibited the lowest values of both the Ô¨Çare index and the
power index. No segregation between the subsets of emerging and
decaying ARs was found.

spectra of 53 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. The ARs were divided
into two subsets of Ô¨Çare-quiet and Ô¨Çare-productive (produced at
least one M1 class Ô¨Çare) ARs. The analysis showed that 90% of
Ô¨Çare-productive ARs and only 12% of Ô¨Çare-quiet ARs exhibited the
power index greater than 2. The authors also argued that Ô¨Çare-quiet
ARs may exhibit high day-to-day variations of the power index
while the power index of Ô¨Çare-productive ARs remains stable
at relatively high level days before and days after Ô¨Çare events.
Mandage & McAteer (2016) concluded that the power index can
be employed to forecast Ô¨Çares several days in advance.

(2005b)

Previous studies of the power index and Ô¨Çare productivity in
ARs used data for predominantly well-developed ARs. Although
6 out of 16 ARs studied in Abramenko (2005b) were classiÔ¨Åed as
emerging ARs, none of them was tracked since the very beginning
of the emergence. Instead, SOHO/MDI started to observe an AR in a
high-resolution mode as soon as the clear emergence of the magnetic
Ô¨Çux was detected. Interestingly, the power index retrieved from the
Ô¨Årst provided magnetogram was quite close to those calculated from

magnetograms of the AR in a well-developed state. In general, the
power index seems to increase abruptly as soon as an AR starts to
emerge (Abramenko 2005b). Hewett et al. (2008) studied the power
index temporal evolution of NOAA AR 10488. They found the rapid
change of the power index from 0.5 to 2.5 within a day (see Ô¨Åg. 8
in Hewett et al. 2008). Kutsenko, Kutsenko & Abramenko (2019)
analysed power index variations in four emerging ARs. All of them
exhibited abrupt increase of the power index as soon as Ô¨Årst imprints
of magnetic Ô¨Çux appeared on the photosphere. An important point
is that the observed value of the power index was typical for mature
ARs and changed insigniÔ¨Åcantly during further evolution of the
ARs.

One more AR parameter

that can be estimated on
the early stages of emerging is the Ô¨Çux emergence rate.
CanÔ¨Åeld, Priest, & Rust (1975) suggested the appearance of solar
Ô¨Çare to be often related to the interaction between old and new
emerging magnetic Ô¨Çuxes. This was later supported by Fu & Welsch
(2016) who concluded that the emergence of a new AR in the vicin-
ity of pre-existed ones is associated with the increase of strong Ô¨Çares
occurrence. Fast-emerging ARs may disturb a pre-existed magnetic
conÔ¨Åguration and initiate magnetic reconnections and eruptions
(Archontis & Syntelis 2019). Thus, Schrƒ≥ver (2009) summarized
that the emergence of a highly-twisted magnetic Ô¨Çux bundle into
pre-existed strong magnetic surroundings leads to strong Ô¨Çares. In
addition, Golovko (1986) and Ishkov (2003) argued that high-rate
magnetic Ô¨Çux emergence often results in the formation of structures
with high magnetic Ô¨Åeld gradients that tend to erupt. These Ô¨Ånd-
ings were recently supported by numerical simulations performed
by Toriumi & Takasao (2017). The authors concluded that complex
magnetic ùõø-spot structures producing the largest X-class Ô¨Çares are
formed due to interaction of several emerging magnetic Ô¨Çux loops
or due to emergence of a highly-twisted magnetic Ô¨Çux bundle.

The Ô¨Çux emergence rate is in general proportional to the
peak magnetic Ô¨Çux of an AR (e.g. Otsuji, et al. 2011; Norton, et al.
2017; Kutsenko, Abramenko & Pevtsov 2019). However, ARs with
similar peak magnetic Ô¨Çux may exhibit signiÔ¨Åcant variations of
the Ô¨Çux emergence rate (Abramenko, et al. 2017). Our analy-
sis of time proÔ¨Åles of the Ô¨Çux emergence rate performed in
Kutsenko, Abramenko & Pevtsov (2019) suggested that ARs often
emerge monotonously at a constant rate. Hence, we suppose that
the Ô¨Çux emergence rate can be estimated on the stage of early emer-
gence.

The aim of this work is to Ô¨Ånd out whether the power index
and the Ô¨Çux emergence rate derived during the early stages of the
emergence can be used to predict the Ô¨Çare productivity of ARs in
the future. To achieve the goal, we intend (i) to analyse temporal
variations of the power index of a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant set of
emerging ARs, and (ii) to explore a relationship between each of
our parameters and Ô¨Çare productivity.

2 DATA AND METHODS

The data set for 423 emerging ARs prepared previously in
Kutsenko, Abramenko & Pevtsov (2019) was utilized as a basis in
this study. For each AR the data set contains a time series of patches
extracted from full-disc LOS magnetograms acquired by SDO/HMI.
The patches represent the magnetic Ô¨Åeld maps of isolated emerging
ARs as well as magnetic Ô¨Åeld maps of the quiet Sun these ARs
emerge from. Each AR was tracked as long as the centre of the
patch was located within 60‚ó¶ from the central meridian. Both the
emergence onset and the peak total unsigned magnetic Ô¨Çux were ob-

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì7 (2020)

served within these longitudinal ranges. A number of parameters,
such as the peak total unsigned magnetic Ô¨Çux, Ô¨Çux emergence rate,
time of the emergence onset and of the emergence halt, are gath-
ered in the data set (see Kutsenko, Abramenko & Pevtsov 2019,
for details). The total unsigned magnetic Ô¨Çux was calculated as a
sum of absolute magnetic Ô¨Çux density values in LOS magnetogram
pixels multiplied by the projection-corrected pixel area. Only pix-
els with absolute magnetic Ô¨Çux density above 18 Mx cm‚àí2 (triple
noise level in 720-s LOS SDO/HMI magnetograms as measured by
Liu et al. 2012) were used in the summation. Before summation,
the ùúá-correction was applied to each pixel in the magnetograms
(Leka, Barnes, & Wagner 2017).

From the entire data set, we selected only ARs with assigned
NOAA number and with the peak total unsigned magnetic Ô¨Çux
between 0.6√ó1021 and 26√ó1021 Mx. The resulting subset consisting
of 243 ARs was analysed in this study. The list of the ARs and the
derived parameters described below are listed in Table 1. The full
table is attached to this article as a supplementary material. For
each NOAA AR, we calculated the magnetic power spectrum of the
LOS magnetic Ô¨Åeld component. The procedure was developed in
Abramenko et al. (2001) and was described in detail in Abramenko
(2005b). BrieÔ¨Çy, a two-dimensional (2D) Fast Fourier Transform is
applied to observed LOS magnetograms acquired at time ùë° yielding
2D spectra. An integration of the spectrum power over thin anulus
between two concentric rings centred at the origin of the 2D-space
of wavenumbers is performed to retrieve the 1D power spectrum
ùê∏ (ùëò, ùë°), where ùëò = 2ùúã/ùëü is the wavenumber and ùëü is the spatial
scale in Mm. An example of the power spectrum evolution for
NOAA AR 12219 is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. An important
characteristic of a power spectrum is its slope. Throughout this paper
we will refer to the negative slope of the power spectrum as the power
index, ùõº. The power index depends on the turbulent regime, i.e., on
the energy transfer mechanism in the medium where the magnetic
Ô¨Åeld evolves (e.g. Kolmogorov 1941; Biskamp 1993). Thus, the
power index of quiet-Sun regions is of about 1.0 while that of AR
ranges between 1.5 and 2.5. The power index is usually measured
by Ô¨Åtting the power spectrum by a linear approximation within the
inertial range. The inertial range is the range of wavenumbers where
the spectrum is linear in a double logarithmic plot and a relationship
ùê∏ (ùëò, ùë°) ‚àù ùëò‚àíùõº holds. The low-frequency (large-scale) limit of the
inertial range relies on the scale where the dominant energy injection
occurs (injection range). Thus, Mandage & McAteer (2016) argued
that this limit may depend on the size of magnetic elements in the
AR. The high-frequency (low-scale) limit is determined either by
the dissipation, or, as in our case, by the (triple) spatial resolution
of the telescope (Abramenko et al. 2001). Since we analyse both
quiet-Sun and AR patches, in order to achieve the homogeneity of
the measured power index we follow Abramenko (2005b) and deÔ¨Åne
the inertial range to be between 2.4 and 10 Mm (Fig. 1).

Time variations of the power index, ùõº(ùë°), and of the total
unsigned magnetic Ô¨Çux, Œ¶(ùë°), in NOAA AR 12219 are shown in
the middle panel of Fig. 1. An abrupt increase of the power index
is clearly seen just after the emergence onset while the total un-
signed magnetic Ô¨Çux exhibits relatively gradual growth (cf. Ô¨Åg. 3 in
Kutsenko, Kutsenko & Abramenko 2019). Magnetic power spectra
for three times labelled ùë°0, ùë° ùõº, and ùë°Œ¶ are shown in the left panel of
Fig. 1. The time ùë°0 corresponds to the emergence onset when both
power index and magnetic Ô¨Çux start to increase. The spectrum at
ùë°0 has a shallow slope of about -1, which is typical for quiet Sun.
As the emergence proceeds an injection of magnetic energy occurs
at all spatial scales. However, the energy injection on larger scales
prevails resulting in the steepening of the spectrum. The power in-

dex saturates at time ùë° ùõº and Ô¨Çuctuates insigniÔ¨Åcantly around some
mean value during further emergence (the Ô¨Çuctuations are several
times less in magnitude than the total increase of the power in-
dex during the emergence). Interestingly, by this time only Ô¨Årst
imprints of emerging AR are seen in the magnetogram (Fig. 1,
right top panel). The energy growth proceeds on all spatial scales
due to emergence of large magnetic elements and/or simultaneous
emergence and merging of smaller magnetic features (Hewett et al.
2008; Kutsenko, Kutsenko & Abramenko 2019). Although the total
energy increases (the spectrum moves upward, see the left panel in
Fig. 1), the slope of the spectrum changes insigniÔ¨Åcantly. The upper
spectrum in the left panel of Fig. 1 corresponds to the time of the
peak magnetic Ô¨Çux, ùë°Œ¶.

Using the data on time variations of the power index and of the
total magnetic Ô¨Çux for each AR, we calculated a set of parameters:

(i) The time of the emergence onset, ùë°0, and the time of the power
index saturation, ùë° ùõº. These times were determined by two Ô¨Åttings of
the ùõº(ùë°) curve with two-segment piece-wise linear functions (shown
in green and orange lines in the middle panel of Fig. 1). For each
Ô¨Åtting, one segment was required to be horizontal while the other
could have arbitrary slope. The desired time point was deÔ¨Åned as
an intersection of the horizontal and inclined segments.

(ii) The time of the peak total unsigned magnetic Ô¨Çux, ùë°Œ¶ was
similarly determined by Ô¨Åtting the Œ¶(ùë°) curve with a two-segment
piece-wise linear function (marked with purple lines in the middle
panel of Fig. 1).

(iii) Saturated power index ùõºùë†ùëéùë° was deÔ¨Åned as the mean value
of the power index over the [ùë° ùõº; ùë° ùõº + 1‚Ñé] interval. Recall that the
inertial range was set to 2.7‚Äì10 Mm. Consequently, only magnetic
elements larger than 2.7 Mm may contribute to the slope of the
power spectrum. The characteristic lifetime of such elements is of
order of hours. Therefore, we suppose that the calculation of the
saturated power index as the mean value of the power index within
1-hour interval is reasonable. The uncertainty in the saturated power
index, ùúéùõºùë†ùëéùë° , was estimated as the standard deviation of the ùõºùë†ùëéùë°
during this 1-hour interval [ùë° ùõº; ùë° ùõº + 1‚Ñé]. Note that the small-scale
noise in the magnetograms aÔ¨Äects exclusively high-frequency tail
of the power spectrum (beyond the inertial range) and does not
inÔ¨Çuence the slope of the power spectrum.

(iv) Mean power index value ùõºùëöùëíùëéùëõ = hùõº(ùë°)i|ùë°Œ¶
ùë°ùõº

Similar to pre-
vious item, the uncertainty in the mean power index, ùúéùõºùëöùëíùëéùëõ , was
estimated as the standard deviation of ùõºùëöùëíùëéùëõ over the [ùë° ùõº; ùë°Œ¶] in-
terval.

(v) Duration of the power index increase Œîùë° ùõº = ùë° ùõº ‚àí ùë°0.
(vi) Duration of the magnetic Ô¨Çux emergence Œîùë°Œ¶ = ùë°Œ¶ ‚àí ùë°0.
(vii) Peak total unsigned magnetic Ô¨Çux Œ¶ùëöùëé ùë• = Œ¶(ùë° = ùë°Œ¶).
The error in Œ¶ùëöùëé ùë• was calculated as ùúéŒ¶ùëöùëéùë•
= √çùëõ 3ùúéùêµ ùë†, where
3ùúéùêµ=18 Mx cm‚àí2 is the triple noise level in the SDO/HMI magne-
tograms (Liu et al. 2012), ùëõ is the number of pixels used to calculate
the total unsigned Ô¨Çux at ùë° = ùë°Œ¶, ùë† is a projection-corrected area of
one pixel.

(viii) Flux emergence rate ùëÖùëé ùë£ = (Œ¶ùëöùëé ùë• ‚àí Œ¶(ùë°0))/Œîùë°Œ¶. The
uncertainty of the Ô¨Çux emergence rate is proportional to the relative
=
uncertainty of the peak magnetic Ô¨Çux and was estimated as ùúéùëÖùëéùë£
(Œ¶ùëöùëéùë• ‚àíŒ¶(ùë°0)) ¬∑ ùëÖùëé ùë£.

(ix) To evaluate the Ô¨Çare productivity of an AR, we, following
Abramenko (2005b), calculated its Ô¨Çare index (FI). FI is a normal-
ized measure of X-ray radiation emitted by an AR:

FI = (100ùëÜ (ùëã) + 10ùëÜ ( ùëÄ ) + 1.0ùëÜ (ùê∂) + 0.1ùëÜ (ùêµ) )/ùúè,

is the number of Ô¨Çares
of a certain class, and ùúè is the total time interval of AR ob-
servation in days (Abramenko 2005b). The data on FI was pro-
vided by the CrAO Solar Application web resource available at
http://solar.dev.argh.team. The website aggregates data on
ARs and Ô¨Çares from diÔ¨Äerent web sources. It provides information
on AR‚Äôs Ô¨Årst and last dates of observation, on the class and power of
the most intense Ô¨Çare produced by the AR, on the duration of the AR
presence on the disc, and on the AR‚Äôs Ô¨Çare index. The noise level of
GOES Ô¨Çuxes is of about 2 √ó 10‚àí8 W m‚àí2 (Aschwanden & Freeland
2012) that is two orders of magnitude less than C1.0 class Ô¨Çare.
Consequently, we suppose that the uncertainties in the Ô¨Çare index
measurements are negligible.

3 RESULTS

In all, among 243 emerging ARs analysed in this study, only 34
of them exhibited the Ô¨Çare index FI equal to or exceeding unity
(at least one C1 class Ô¨Çare per day). We will refer to this 34 ARs
as a set of Ô¨Çaring ARs through the rest of the paper. Such a low
fraction of Ô¨Çare-productive ARs in the set can be explained, Ô¨Årst,

by low activity of Solar Cycle 24, and, second, by strong selection
rules: both the emergence onset and the peak magnetic Ô¨Çux must
be observed within ¬±60‚ó¶ from the central meridian. In addition, a
majority of newly-emerged ARs were quite weak to produce strong
Ô¨Çares or the Ô¨Çaring might start after the ARs moved to the far-side
of the Sun.

3.1 Temporal evolution of the power index

Duration of the magnetic Ô¨Çux emergence, Œîùë°Œ¶, versus duration of
the power index increase, Œîùë° ùõº, for the entire data set is shown in
the upper panel of Fig. 2. The plot shows that in the most of the
cases Œîùë° ùõº does not exceed one day (11 h on average) while the Ô¨Çux
emergence may last for several days. Consequently, the value of
saturated power index can be estimated during initial stages of AR‚Äôs
emergence. A dotted diagonal line is plotted to emphasize that for
the majority of the cases, the power index increase is faster than the
increase of the total unsigned Ô¨Çux (note also equal axis scales). Red
circles in Fig. 2 indicate the 34 Ô¨Çaring ARs. As one can see, there
is no clear diÔ¨Äerence between the distributions of Ô¨Çare-productive
and Ô¨Çare-quiet ARs.

The lower panel of Fig. 2 shows the saturated power index

uncertainties in the measured data was taken into account using the
technique described in Saccenti, Hendriks, & Smilde (2020). Most
of the data points are concentrated along the diagonal of the plot
suggesting that on average the saturated power index (measured dur-
ing the early stages of emergence) is a good estimator of the power
index observed during the entire duration of emergence.

respectively. In these plots we used data on Ô¨Çaring ARs with FI‚â• 1.
The plots show the absence of correlation between Ô¨Çare and power
indices. This result might be caused by a speciÔ¨Åc choice of ARs in
this work and is discussed in detail in Section 4.

3.3 Flux emergence rate and Ô¨Çare productivity of

newly-emerged ARs

The scatter plots of the Ô¨Çare index FI versus the peak magnetic
Ô¨Çux Œ¶ùëöùëé ùë• and FI versus the Ô¨Çux emergence rate ùëÖùëé ùë£ are shown in
the upper and lower panels of Fig. 4, respectively. The Ô¨Çare index
exhibits a good positive correlation with the peak total unsigned
Ô¨Çux with Pearson‚Äôs correlation coeÔ¨Écient ùúå = 0.67 that is in a
good agreement with previous results (e.g. Leka & Barnes 2007).
The correlation between the Ô¨Çux emergence rate and the Ô¨Çare index
is even better. The Pearson‚Äôs correlation coeÔ¨Écient ùúå reaches 0.74
for the data set of the 34 Ô¨Çaring ARs. Possible implications of this
Ô¨Ånding are discussed in the next section 4. Note, however, that there
are ARs in our set of 243 ARs that exhibited high Ô¨Çux emergence
rate but produced no signiÔ¨Åcant Ô¨Çares.

An interesting example of fast-emerging and Ô¨Çare-productive
AR is NOAA AR 12673 that was the most Ô¨Çare-productive AR
in Solar Cycle 24. The AR produced a series of M- and X-class
Ô¨Çares including the strongest X9.3 Ô¨Çare on 2017 September 06 (e.g.
Wang et al. 2018). The AR appeared on the Eastern limb of the solar
disc as a decaying unipolar spot. During the passage across the disc,
an intense emergence of a new magnetic Ô¨Çux started to the East from
the pre-existed sunspot (see Yang et al. 2017, for a morphological
analysis of AR‚Äôs evolution). Sun & Norton (2017) found that the
averaged Ô¨Çux emergence rate was 4.93 √ó 1020 Mx h-1 that was

higher than ever reported previously. Although NOAA AR 12673
did not formally meet our requirements on emerging ARs (this AR
did not appear amidst quiet Sun), we plotted ùëÖùëé ùë£ and FI for this one
on the bottom panel of Fig. 4 by a red star symbol. The position of
the star agrees very well with the relationship between the averaged
Ô¨Çux emergence rate and the magnitude of the Ô¨Çare index as derived
from the set of the 34 Ô¨Çaring ARs. Adding this data point to the set of
Ô¨Çaring ARs increases the linear correlation coeÔ¨Écient between ùëÖùëé ùë£
and ùëôùëúùëî(ùêπ ùêº) and yields Pearson‚Äôs correlation coeÔ¨Écient ùúå = 0.82.
This experiment with NOAA AR 12673 allows us to suggest that
a general tendency of the relationship between the Ô¨Çux emergence
rate and the Ô¨Çare index is captured correctly.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We employed SDO/HMI data for 243 emerging ARs to carry out a
statistical analysis of temporal variations of the magnetic spectrum
power index during the emergence of an AR. We found that the
power index starts to increase abruptly as soon as the Ô¨Årst imprints
of magnetic Ô¨Çux appear on the photosphere. The duration of the

power index growth from values typical for quiet-Sun to higher
values typical for ARs usually does not exceed 1 day. This interval
is several times shorter than the typical duration of magnetic Ô¨Çux
emergence lasting up to 6 days for the largest AR observed in this
study. As the emergence proceeds, the power index usually stabilizes
at values typically observed in well-developed ARs and exhibits just
slight Ô¨Çuctuations (with magnitude being several times less than the
power index increase) throughout the whole process of emergence.
Consequently, in most cases we can evaluate the averaged value of
the power index of a well-developed AR in advance if we observe
the AR since the onset of emergence.

We found no correlation between the power index of emerging
ARs and their future Ô¨Çare productivity. The reason for this negative
result might be our restrict selection rules, and therefore, a scanty
data set, only 34 cases. Besides, the very low activity of Solar
Cycle 24 was the cause for the absence of strong Ô¨Çaring ARs in
our data set. Note that Abramenko (2005b) analysed strong well-
developed ARs of Solar Cycle 23 with a wide range of Ô¨Çare index
ranging from 0 to 130. In the present data set, the highest Ô¨Çare index
magnitude is 41 for NOAA AR 11158, only two ARs exhibit the
Ô¨Çare index exceeding 20 and 5 ARs have Ô¨Çare index exceeding 10.
In Ô¨Åg. 8 in Abramenko (2005b) there is a large scatter of power
indices values (from 1.8 to 2.1) for the range of Ô¨Çare index 10‚Äì50
that is in accordance with our results. Seemingly, our restrictions
on emerging ARs do not allow us to include more Ô¨Çare productive
ARs. Indeed, we required both the emergence onset and halt to be
observed within 60‚ó¶ from the central meridian, i.e. the total interval
of the AR tracking was limited to approximately 9 days. In that case,
the process of emergence of strong ARs capable to produce strong
Ô¨Çares might not be captured and/or the Ô¨Çaring might start when the
AR rotated to the far-side of the Sun. Summarizing, we conclude
that the power index of the magnetic spectrum, as a predictive
parameter, deserves further investigations based on data for other
solar cycles, more strong than the analysed here Solar Cycle 24.

An interesting result that can have implications for solar Ô¨Çare
forecasting is the relationship between the Ô¨Çare index and the Ô¨Çux
emergence rate of ARs. For the 34 Ô¨Çare-productive ARs (FI ‚â• 1) the
logarithm of the Ô¨Çare index was in a good linear correlation with the
Ô¨Çux emergence rate (Pearson‚Äôs correlation coeÔ¨Écient is 0.74). Note
that in contrast to previous researches mentioned in section 1, in
the present study we considered only isolated ARs emerging amidst
quiet-Sun areas. Our results suggest that fast-emerging ARs tend to
Ô¨Çare even if they emerge into areas with no pre-existed magnetic
Ô¨Çux.

In our data set of 243 ARs there were a lot of rather small ARs
that exhibited high value of Ô¨Çux emergence rate but produced no
signiÔ¨Åcant Ô¨Çares. We argue that the high Ô¨Çux emergence rate is a
necessary but not suÔ¨Écient condition for an ARs to produce strong
Ô¨Çares. At the same time, one should keep in mind that at least a part
of ARs with high Ô¨Çux emergence rate start Ô¨Çaring at the far-side of
the Sun after they rotate oÔ¨Ä the western limb.

The Ô¨Çux emergence rate measurements might be employed to
make early forecast of AR‚Äôs Ô¨Çaring activity. First, the Ô¨Çux emergence
rate can be continuously re-evaluated as the emergence proceeds,
and therefore, the future Ô¨Çare productivity might be continuously
evaluated more precisely. Second, the Ô¨Çux emergence rate is an
easy-to-measure quantity that can be evaluated from, say, ultravio-
let maps of an AR (Schrƒ≥ver 1987). This is an advantage of ùëÖùëé ùë£
for solar Ô¨Çare forecasting compared to other quantities since emer-
gence rate measurement does not require sophisticated magnetic
Ô¨Åeld data. Thus, Ugarte-Urra et al. (2015) used 304 √Ö ultraviolet
observations provided by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observa-
