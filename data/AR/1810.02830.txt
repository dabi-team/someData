ABSTRACT

We present chemical abundances and radial velocities of six H ii regions in the
extremely metal-poor star-forming dwarf galaxy DDO 68. They are derived from deep
spectra in the wavelength range 3500 - 10,000 ˚A, acquired with the Multi Object
Double Spectrograph (MODS) at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). In the three
regions where the [O III]λ4363 ˚A line was detected, we inferred the abundance of He, N,
O, Ne, Ar, and S through the “direct” method. We also derived the oxygen abundances
of all the six regions adopting indirect method calibrations. We conﬁrm that DDO 68
is an extremely metal-poor galaxy, and a strong outlier in the luminosity - metallic-
ity relation deﬁned by star-forming galaxies. With the direct-method we ﬁnd indeed
an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)=7.14±0.07 in the northernmost region of the
galaxy and, although with large uncertainties, an even lower 12+log(O/H)=6.96±0.09
in the “tail”. This is, at face value, the most metal-poor direct abundance detection
of any galaxy known. We derive a radial oxygen gradient of -0.06±0.03 dex/kpc (or
-0.30 dex R−1
25 ) with the direct method, and a steeper gradient of -0.12±0.03 dex/kpc
(or -0.59 dex R−1
25 ) from the indirect method. For the α-element to oxygen ratios we
obtain values in agreement with those found in other metal-poor star-forming dwarfs.
For nitrogen, instead, we infer much higher values, leading to log(N/O)∼ −1.4, at vari-
ance with the suggested existence of a tight plateau at −1.6 in extremely metal poor
dwarfs. The derived helium mass fraction ranges from Y=0.240±0.005 to Y=0.25±0.02,
compatible with standard big bang nucleosynthesis. Finally, we measured H ii region
radial velocities in the range 479−522 km/s from the tail to the head of the “comet”,
consistent with the rotation derived in the HI.

1 INTRODUCTION

DDO 68 (UGC 5340, SDSS J0956+2849) is a star-forming
dwarf galaxy of special interest in the framework of the Λ
Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) scenario for galaxy formation,
because it is one of the ﬁrst observed systems conﬁrming the
prediction that dark matter haloes host substructures down
to the resolution limit of the simulations (Diemand et al.
2008; Wheeler et al. 2015), i.e., down to the smallest mass

scales. In fact, in spite of being located in the huge Lynx-
Cancer void (Pustilnik & Tepliakva 2011) and of having
formed a total mass of stars of only 108 M⊙ (Sacchi et al.
2016), DDO 68 clearly suﬀers the presence of at least three
smaller companions, thus appearing as a ﬂea with smaller
ﬂeas that on him prey1 (Annibali et al. 2016).

DDO 68 is at a distance of ∼12.7 Mpc from us

(Cannon et al. 2014; Sacchi et al. 2016; Makarov et al.
2017). With an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)∼7.14
measured in a few H ii regions at
its northern edge
(Pustilnik et al. 2005, 2007; Izotov & Thuan 2007, 2009),
about 1/40 of
it
is an extremely metal-poor (XMP) dwarf, much metal-
poorer than typical dwarfs of similar mass (Pustilnik et al.
2005). As a consequence, DDO 68 strongly deviates from
the mean luminosity-metallicity relation deﬁned by star-
forming galaxies in the Local Universe (Lequeux et al. 1979;
Skillman et al. 1989; Berg et al. 2012).

Because of its very distorted morphology, DDO 68 was
suggested to be aﬀected by galaxy interaction already years
ago (Ekta, Chengalur & Pustilnik 2008; Cannon et al. 2014;
Tikhonov, Galazutdinova, & Lebedev 2014). Ekta et al. no-
ticed distortions in the H i distribution and interpreted the
observed features in terms of a late-stage merger of two gas-
rich progenitors. Tikhonov et al. proposed that the portion
of the galaxy that appears as a cometary tail is actually
a disrupted satellite currently being cannibalized by DDO
68, while Cannon et al. identiﬁed a possible H i satellite,
with MHI ≃ 3 × 107 M⊙, at a projected distance of ≃40 kpc
from the main body. Annibali et al. (2016), combining Hub-
ble Space Telescope (HST) and Large Binocular Telescope
(LBT) photometry, showed that, in addition to the known
cometary tail, there is a faint, small stellar stream falling on
the main body of DDO 68 and an arc possibly resulting from
tidal interactions. They found that the morphologies of tail,
stream, arc and main body are well reproduced by N-body
simulations of the interaction among three distinct bodies,
the main body and two smaller ones with masses 1/10 and
1/150 the mass of the main body.

H ii regions. From deep and accurate Colour-Magnitude
diagrams
obtained from HST photometry,
Sacchi et al. (2016) inferred a robust spatially resolved star
formation history (SFH) of the various regions of DDO 68,
ﬁnding that everywhere stars were already forming at the
oldest lookback time reached by the photometry, i.e. at
least 2-3 Gyr ago, corresponding to the minimum age of
the measured RGB stars. The measured RGB stars may
actually be up to 13 Gyr old, but the age-metallicity degen-
eracy aﬀecting the RGB prevents one to precisely age-date
these stars, since independent spectroscopic estimates of
their metallicity are not available. According to Sacchi et
al., DDO 68 is likely to have formed stars at a low rate
during its whole life, with a signiﬁcant enhancement a few
hundred million years ago, a peak activity of ∼ 4.6 × 10−2
M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2 between 20 and 60 Myr ago, and a current
much lower rate.

If the galaxy has formed stars for a Hubble time, al-
though at a relatively low rate, how did it manage to re-
main so metal-poor? Is it because it has recently accreted
signiﬁcant amounts of very low-metallicity gas that diluted
its medium, or because it got rid through diﬀerential galac-
tic winds of the elements produced by its stars? Chemi-
cal evolution models of late-type dwarfs have often invoked
both eﬀects to reproduce the observed low chemical abun-

dances of star-forming dwarfs (see e.g., Matteucci & Tosi
1985; Pilyugin 1992; Marconi et al. 1994; Romano et al.
2006; Recchi et al. 2008; Romano & Starkerburg 2013), sug-
gesting that the outﬂows triggered by supernova explosions
in these shallow potential well systems may be more eﬃ-
cient in ejecting some of the heavy elements (like the α-
elements and iron) than other chemical species such as H and
He. Indeed, hydrodynamical simulations of late-type dwarfs
(e.g., D’Ercole & Brighenti 1999; Mac Low & Ferrara 1999;
Scannapieco & Br¨uggen 2010) clearly show that the outﬂows
that blow out of these galaxies drive substantial amounts of
the metals produced in the starburst into the intergalactic
medium. Other authors have instead considered the infall
of primordial gas suﬃcient (see, e.g. Gavil`an et al. 2013) to
reproduce the observed metallicities. It has also been sug-
gested (e.g. Legrand et al. 2000) that a continuous, very low
star formation regime could account for the observed abun-
dances in some extremely metal poor dwarf galaxies.

The combination of a detailed SFH with chemical abun-
dances derived from accurate spectroscopy and with con-
straints on the dynamics of its various constituents is a key
ingredient to reconstruct a coherent and complete picture
of how DDO 68 (and, more in general, XMPs) formed and
evolved. To this aim, here we exploit the Multi Object Dou-
ble Spectrograph (MODS) mounted on the LBT to study
DDO 68’s H ii regions.

In this paper, Section 2 describes the observations and
data reduction, and Section 3 presents the procedure for the
derivation of the reddening-corrected emission line ﬂuxes.
The results of temperatures, densities, chemical abundances
are described in Section 4, while the derived abundances,
abundance ratios and abundance spatial distributions are
described in Section 5. Radial velocities are presented and
discussed in Section 6. The overall results are discussed and
summarised in Section 7.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

Our observations (LBT program 2016-2017-50, PI Annibali)
were performed on February 21, 2017, with MODS1 and
MODS2 mounted on LBT. The LBT, located at Mt. Gra-
ham (Arizona), is composed of two identical 8.4 m telescopes
that can work simultaneously in binocular mode, and it is
larger than all telescopes used for previous optical spectro-
scopic studies of DDO 68. When used in dichroic mode, the
MODS spectrographs provide high quality spectra in the
∼3400-5500 ˚A and ∼5700-9800 ˚A ranges for the blue and
red channels, respectively. The 6′ × 6′ ﬁeld of view of MODS
is perfectly suited to cover the whole DDO 68 system and its
surroundings. The target H ii regions were selected from our
HST (GO program 11578; PI: Aloisi) V, I, and Hα images. In
those images, H ii regions are resolved and appear as regions
of diﬀuse Hα and V (i.e. [OIII]λλ4959,5007) emission. In or-
der to look for diﬀerences (or lack thereof) in the abundances
of the diﬀerent structures, we selected H ii regions covering
all the main structural zones of DDO 68, and targeted six
of them for our observations. According to Hα images from
our HST program and from Pustilnik et al. (2005), no emis-
sion line region is found along the faint stream discovered by
Annibali et al. (2016). In addition, we targeted a candidate
star cluster (CL) and two potential companions of DDO 68

dances of He, N, O, Ne, S, and Ar. The observations were
performed in binocular mode using MODS1 and MODS2 si-
multaneously. The exposure times were dictated by the need
to observe the relatively faint [OIII]λ4363 auroral line with
a signal/noise of at least 3, to derive the nebular electronic
temperatures. We had 12 exposures in Run A and 10 in Run
B of 600 sec each, for a total of less than 4 hours. The seeing
varied between ∼0.5” and ∼0.8”, and the airmass from ∼1.0
to ∼1.1. In order to avoid signiﬁcant eﬀects from diﬀerential
atmospheric refraction (see e.g. Filippenko 1982), the slits
were approximately oriented along the parallactic angle (see
Table 1). We used the MODS observing planning tool2 to
check that our observations were not aﬀected by ﬂux losses
due to diﬀerential atmospheric refraction indeed.

The data acquired with MODS1 and MODS2 were
treated separately, since the two instruments turned out
to have diﬀerent sensitivities. However, to allow for the
potential detection of
intrinsically faint, key lines (e.g.,
[O III]λ4363), we also produced deep spectra combin-
ing together all the MODS1 and MODS2 sub-exposures.
Bias and ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections, and wavelength calibration
were executed by the Italian LBT Spectroscopic Reduc-
tion Facility at INAF-IASF Milano. They provided the cali-
brated two-dimensional (2D) spectra for the individual sub-
exposures. The accuracy of the wavelength calibration ob-
tained from the pipeline was checked against prominent sky
lines adopting the nominal sky wavelengths tabulated in
Hanuschik (2003). Then, the individual sub-exposures were
sky-subtracted and combined into ﬁnal 2D blue and red
frames. The sky subtraction was performed with the back-
ground task in IRAF3, typically choosing the windows at the
two opposite sides of the central source. The typical size of
our H II regions (FWHM.2”) is signiﬁcantly smaller than
the adopted slit lengths of 15”-20”, allowing for an adequate
removal of the sky background. The one-dimensional (1D)
spectra were extracted from the 2D wavelength-calibrated
and sky-subtracted spectra by running the apall task in the
twodspec IRAF package. The eﬀective spectral resolution of
our spectra, as measured from prominent sky lines in the
1D background-unsubtracted spectra, is R∼1400 at λ ∼ 5500
˚A and R∼1000 at λ ∼ 7200 ˚A.

The blue and red 1D spectra were ﬂux calibrated using
the sensitivity curves from the Italian LBT spectroscopic
reduction pipeline; the curves were derived using the spec-
trophotometric standard star GD 71, observed with both
MODS1 and MODS2 in dichroic mode with a 5′′-width slit
on the same night as our targets and at the same airmass.
Each MODS1/MODS2 spectrum was calibrated using the
appropriate sensitivity functions, while the deep, total com-
bined spectra were calibrated through an average sensitiv-
ity curve. After calibration, the MODS1, MODS2, and to-
tal combined spectra turned out to typically agree within
5−10 %. The ﬁnal calibrated MODS1 and MODS2 spectra
of our nine targets are shown in Figure 2 and Figures A1 to
A8 in the Appendix. As shown by the spectra, Gal. 1 and

our 9 MODS slits. Six slits (1, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9) were centred
on H ii regions in DDO 68, two slits (Gal 1 and Gal 2) on two
candidate galaxy companions, and one slit (dubbed CL) on a
candidate star cluster in DDO 68. For completeness, we also in-
dicate (in grey) Reg. 2 and Reg. 6 identiﬁed by Pustilnik et al.
(2005) and not observed in our study because of slit positioning

detected in our LBT images (dubbed Gal 1 and Gal 2). An
LBT image of DDO 68 with overimposed the positions of
our 9 slits is shown in Figure 1.

Four of our target H ii regions were already observed by
Pustilnik et al. (2005) and Izotov & Thuan (2009); for them
we adopt the names assigned by those authors, i.e. regions
1, 3, 4, and 7 (see Fig. 1.) Regions 8 and 9 are instead newly
observed H ii regions. One H ii region (Reg. 8) is close to the
centre of the main body, two (Reg. 7 and Reg. 9) lie along
the cometary tail, and three (Reg. 1, Reg. 3 and Reg. 4) in
the northern ring-like structure that some consider the head
of the comet (Makarov et al. 2017). Reg. 3 also includes the
Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) studied by Izotov & Thuan
(2009) and Pustilnik et al. (2016)

Observations and data reduction have been designed fol-
lowing the same strategy devised by Annibali et al. (2017)
for the star-forming irregular galaxy NGC 4449. We have
crafted the masks using our HST images, and adopting a
slit width of 1′′; for the H II regions, we adopted slit lengths
between 15” and 20”, suﬃcient to include also a portion of
the background without signiﬁcant nebular emission. We de-
signed two diﬀerent masks, implemented in two separate
runs (Run A and Run B) to be able to place the slits on
all our 9 target regions. We observed our targets using the
blue G400L (3200−5800 ˚A) and the red G670L (5000−10000
˚A) gratings on the blue and red channels in dichroic mode,
to cover the spectral range from the [OII]λ3727 nebular line
to the [SIII]λ9530 line, allowing the derivation of the abun-

Gal. 2 turned out to be background emission-line galaxies
at redshifts of z∼0.11 and z∼0.0148, respectively, and CL an
early-type galaxy at z∼0.42. Since they are not related to
DDO 68, these systems will be no longer discussed in the
paper.

3 EMISSION LINE MEASUREMENT

Emission line ﬂuxes were measured with the deblend func-
tion in the splot IRAF task. We ﬁtted all together lines
close in wavelengths (e.g. Hβ, HeIλ4922, [O III]λλ4959, 5007,
HeIλ5015) assuming a Gaussian proﬁle, leaving the centroids
and FWHM as free parameters, but imposing the FWHMs
to be the same for all ﬁtted lines. The continuum was de-
ﬁned choosing two continuum windows to the left and to
the right of the line or line complex, and ﬁtting it with a
linear regression. In the case of the [N II]λλ6548,84 lines,
blended with the much stronger Hα emission and therefore
diﬃcult to measure, we did not leave the centroids as free
but allowed a single shift with respect to the nominal zero-
velocity line wavelengths. Furthermore, we introduced an
additional broad Hα component in the ﬁt of Reg. 1 and 3
to properly reproduce the observed wings. The ﬁnal emis-
sion ﬂuxes were obtained repeating the measurement several
times with slightly diﬀerent continuum choices, and averag-
ing the results. The procedure was applied separately to the
MODS1 and the MODS2 spectra. We found that in gen-
eral MODS2 provided ﬂuxes about 5% higher than MODS1.
The ﬁnal line ﬂuxes were computed averaging the results
from MODS1 and MODS2, and the errors were computed

as the standard deviation from the two diﬀerent measure-
ments. The detection of intrinsically faint lines that are key
to the determination of the electronic temperatures (e.g.,
[O III]λ4363, [S III]λ6312, [O II]λλ7320,30) was checked on
the 2D spectra. The [O III]λ4363 line is well detected in
Reg. 1 and Reg. 3, is quite faint in Reg. 7, and is not de-
tected in the other regions. For Reg. 7, the measurement
of this important feature was performed on the deep total
combined spectrum.

Reg. 3 is known to host a LBV, discovered by
Pustilnik et al. (2008) from the presence of broad emission
components, P-Cygni proﬁles, and spectral variability. The
LBV experienced a very rare event of a giant eruption dur-
ing the years 2008-2011, and was in a “faint” state during
the years 2015-2016 (Pustilnik et al. 2017). During the out-
burst event, the Hβ emission of Reg. 3 was observed to over-
come that of the [O III]λ5007 line, as shown in Fig. 1 of
Pustilnik et al. (2008). All these properties are not observed
in our data of Reg. 3, which look more simular to the spec-
trum acquired in 2005 by Pustilnik et al, when the LBV was
at its minimum. We conclude therefore that at the epoch
of our observations the LBV was, as during the years 2015-
2016, in a rather quiescent phase.

The derived emission lines for the six H ii regions stud-
ied in DDO 68 are provided in Table B1 in the Appendix.

Balmer underlying absorption and reddening were de-
rived simultaneously through a χ2 minimization procedure.
Based on the measured Hδ, Hγ, Hβ and Hα ﬂuxes, we con-
structed the following χ2 from all possible line combinations:

In Eq. 3, FH β and FH α are the emission ﬂuxes mea-
sured on the spectra, CH β and CH α are the local continua,
and EWabs is the underlying unknown Balmer absorption in
equivalent width assumed to be the same for Hδ, Hγ, Hβ,
and Hα. This is a reasonable assumption since simple stel-
lar populations models (e.g. Leitherer et al. 2014, hereafter
SB99) show that the equivalent width ratios of these absorp-
tion lines are close to unity. As for the theoretical Balmer
line ratios, we adopted values of Rt eo

Eq. (1) are obtained by propagating the ﬂux errors on the

The χ2 minimization provides reddening values in the
range E(B-V)∼ 0.07 − 0.24 mag and absorption correc-
tions below EW∼1.5 ˚A for our six H ii regions in DDO 68,
consistent with previous works (e.g. Pustilnik et al. 2005).
As for Helium lines, the absorption correction was di-
rectly estimated from SB99 simple stellar population mod-
els with Z=0.001 (the lowest metallicity available for the
high-resolution spectra products) and age<10 Myr, result-
ing into EW(He Iλ4471)∼0.5 ˚A, EW(He Iλ5876)∼0.5 ˚A, and
EW(He Iλ6678)∼0.3 ˚A. The assumption of a young SSP for
the underlying continuum is a reasonable choice since, al-
though DDO 68 experienced a quite continuous SFH from
several Gyrs ago until present (Sacchi et al. 2016), the inte-
grated stellar light within its H II regions is dominated by
young massive stars. The derived E(B−V) values and the ﬁ-
nal emission-line ﬂuxes corrected for reddening and underly-
ing absorption are provided in Table 2 for our six H ii regions
in DDO 68.

4 TEMPERATURES, DENSITIES AND

CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES

Temperatures, densities, and chemical abundances were ob-
tained following the procedure described in Annibali et al.
(2017), using the getCrossTemDen and getIonAbundance
tasks of the PyNeb code (Luridiana et al. 2015). The
getCrossTemDen task simultaneously derives electron den-
sities (ne) and temperatures (Te) through an iterative
process assuming a density-sensitive and a temperature-
sensitive diagnostic line ratio. We used the density-
sensitive [S II] λ6716/λ6731 ratio to derive ne and,
when possible, three sets of temperature-sensitive line ra-
tios ([O III]λ4363/λ4959 + λ5007, [S III]λ6312/λ9069, and
[O II]λ7320 + λ7330/λλ3726, 29) to derive the tempera-
ture of the O++
ions, respectively. Table 3
summarises the results obtained for our H ii regions in
DDO 68. The derived densities are typically low, with
ne . 100 cm−3, in agreement with the results found for
other star-forming dwarf galaxies (see, e.g., Annibali et al.
2015, 2017). The O++
temperature could only be determined
for Reg. 1, Reg. 3, and Reg. 7. We found high Te(O++)

, and O+

, S++

in the range 17,000−19,000 K, in agreement with the re-
sults of Pustilnik et al. (2005) and Izotov & Thuan (2009).
The S++
temperature could only be obtained for Reg. 1,
due to the faintness of the [S III]λ6312 line in the other
regions; the derived value of ∼19,000 K is in very good
agreement with the theoretical relation between Te(O++) and
Te(S++) proposed by Garnett (1992) (see below). On the
other hand, the Te(O+) obtained for Reg. 1 (and for Reg. 4)
strongly deviates from the theoretical relations, a problem
that was already found and discussed by previous authors
(e.g. Kennicutt et al. 2003; Bresolin et al. 2009a; Berg et al.
2015) and that warns against the use of O+
temperatures
directly derived from the [O II]λλ7320, 30/λλ3726, 29 ratio.
Chemical abundances were derived for Reg. 1, Reg. 3,
and Reg. 7 assuming a three-zone model for the electron tem-
perature structure. The Te(O++) temperature was adopted
, He+2),
for the highest-ionization zone (O+2, Ne+2, He+
the Te(S++) temperature for the intermediate-ionization
zone (S+2, Ar+2), and the Te(O+) temperature for the low-
ionization zone (O+
, Fe+2). For sake of homogene-
ity, and because of the aforementioned potential problems
aﬀecting Te(O+) determinations, we computed the S++
and
O+
temperatures from the theoretical relations of Garnett
(1992):

, N +

, S+

Te[S I I I] = 0.83 × Te[O I I I] + 1700 K,

Te[O I I] = 0.70 × Te[O I I I] + 3000 K.

To determine the abundances of the various ions, we
used the extinction-corrected ﬂuxes (listed in Table 2) of
the following lines: He I λ4471, He I λ5876, and He I λ6678
, He II λ4686 (when available) for He+2, [N II]λ6584
for He+
, [O III]λλ4959,5007 for O+2, [O II]λλ3726,29 for O+
for N +
,
[Ne III]λ3869 for Ne+2, [S II]λλ6716,31 for S+
, [S III]λ9069
for S+2, and [Ar III]λ7136 for Ar+2. The PyNeb code adopts
the He I emissivities of Porter et al. (2012, 2013) including
collisional excitation, so no correction to the emission line
ﬂuxes for this eﬀect (Clegg 1987) needs to be applied. The
He I λ7065 line, which has a strong contribution from col-
lisional excitation, was not included in the computation of
the He+
; in fact, the uncertainties on the derived ne val-
ues translate into large errors on the He+
abundance due
to the strong dependence of the He I λ7065 emissivity on
density (see e.g. Fig. 4 of Porter et al. 2012). We did not use
the faint HeIλ4922 line or the HeIλ5015 line, blended to the
much stronger [O III]λ5007 emission. The ion abundance un-
certainties were derived running the getIonAbundance task
for ranges of temperatures, densities, and ﬂux ratios within
the ±1σ levels, and conservatively adopting the maximum
excursion around the nominal abundance value as our error.
In the case of He+
, the abundance was computed by averag-
ing the individual abundances from the HeIλ4471, HeIλ5876,
and HeIλ6678 lines.

Total element abundances were derived from the abun-
dances of ions seen in the optical spectra using ionization
correction factors (ICFs). For Oxygen, the total abundance
was computed as O/H = (O+ + O+2)/H+
; the contribution
of O+3 to the total oxygen abundance is in fact expected
to be <1%, since O+/(O+ + O+2) > 0.1 in our H ii regions
(Izotov et al. 2006). The He abundance was computed from

, with the exception of Reg. 1 where we added the contri-
bution from He+2. On the other hand, the contribution from
the broad He II λ4686 emission detected in Reg. 3 was not
included, since likely of stellar origin. For all the elements
other than O and He, we adopted the ICFs from Izotov et al.
(2006) for the low Z regime (Eq. (18) through (22) in that
paper) to obtain total abundances.

As mentioned in Section 2, the abundances of Reg. 1 and
Reg. 3 (as well as those of Reg. 2 and Reg. 6, not present
in our sample) were inferred with the direct Te method by
other authors (Pustilnik et al. 2005, 2008; Izotov & Thuan
2007, 2009). For these two regions, our abundances are con-
sistent with theirs: more speciﬁcally, we obtain for Reg. 1 an
abundance of 12 + log(O/H)=7.10±0.02, within 1 σ of the
value of 7.14±0.03 from Izotov & Thuan (2007) and within 2
σ of the value of 7.19±0.05 from Pustilnik et al. (2008); for
Reg. 3 we derive 12 + log(O/H)=7.14±0.07, within 1 σ of
the values of 7.15±0.04 and 7.10±0.06 from Izotov & Thuan
(2009) and Pustilnik et al. (2008), respectively. We therefore

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2018)

conﬁrm an extremely low oxygen abundance in DDO 68’
s H ii regions. Furthermore, we report for the ﬁrst time a
3-σ direct method abundance measurement in a region in
the “tail” of DDO 68, namely Reg. 7 (since Pustilnik et al.
(2005) reported there a 1-σ [O III]λ4363 detection), ﬁnding
an abundance of 12 + log(O/H)=6.96±0.09, even lower than
in the “head” of the comet. Our results are summarized in
Table 3.

4.1 Indirect method

Since [O III]λ4363 was measured only in half of our tar-
gets, for all the H ii regions in our sample we also derived
oxygen abundances using the indirect method. As widely
discussed in the literature, this method is aﬀected by much
larger uncertainties than the direct one, and furthermore
diﬀerent calibrations can disagree by as much as ∼0.5 dex
(Kewley & Ellison 2008). For our study, we considered the
two diﬀerent calibrations proposed by Yin et al. (2007) and

Pilyugin & Grebel (2016); we caution that these relations
have been calibrated on direct-method abundances of 12 +
> 7.10, whereas we are applying them to a lower
log(O/H) ∼
metallicity regime for our study of DDO 68. Figure 3 shows,
for Reg. 1, Reg. 3, and Reg. 7 , the comparison between the
abundances derived with the direct method and those ob-
tained with the two diﬀerent indirect-method calibrations.
We notice that for Reg. 1 and Reg. 3 the Pilyugin & Grebel
calibration provides the best agreement with the direct-Te
method. On the other hand, both calibrations underestimate
by more than 0.2 dex the abundance derived for Reg. 7, the
most metal-poor. The results from the two calibrations for
our six H ii regions are summarized in Table 4.

relative to hydrogen, whereas the primordial helium abun-
dance is usually estimated in mass fraction YP. We then con-
vert our measured He/H values to the corresponding mass
fraction Y via Pagel et al. (1992)’s simple relation:
Y ={4 He/H [1-20(O/H)]}/(1+4He/H).

(6)

We infer helium mass fractions of Y=0.246±0.007,
0.240±0.005, and 0.25±0.02 for Regions 1, 3 and 7, respec-
tively. Notice that the quoted errors do not include system-
atic uncertainties due to the underlying theoretical assump-
tions and adopted physical parameters in the abundance
computation. Peimbert et al. (2007), and references therein,
evaluated the consequences on the derived primordial helium
of several eﬀects, including new atomic data. Izotov et al.
(2007) extensively discussed all possible systematic eﬀects
that challenge high-accuracy determinations of helium abun-
dances in H II regions: He emissivities, reddening, tempera-
ture and ionization structure of the H II region, underlying
stellar He absorption, collisional excitation of hydrogen lines,
deviation from case B recombination. Using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo analysis, Aver et al. (2011) demonstrated that,
even in presence of high-quality spectra of H II regions, sta-
tistical and systematical uncertainties in the derived helium
abundances can be as high as several percents.

Figure 4 shows how DDO 68’s helium abundances de-
rived here compare with the distribution of Y vs O/H in
metal-poor star-forming galaxies. Our helium mass fractions
lie at the low-oxygen end of the plot, and cover a range
of values from slightly lower than in IZw18 (Izotov et al.
2007), to slightly higher than in Leo P (Skillman et al. 2013),
with the warning that the highest value shows a signiﬁ-
cantly large error. DDO 68’s helium abundances are con-
sistent with Izotov et al. (2014)’s, Aver et al. (2011)’s and
Fern´andez et al. (2018)’s primordial values within 3 σ un-
certainties. We notice that Fern´andez et al. (2018) excluded
from their linear regression the regions with higher He/H
and N/O, arguing that they could be contaminated by
nearby Wolf-Rayet stars. For this reason we do not attempt
to derive a new regression line including also our data points,
but simply show them in the plot.

Only in the last ten years or so, have people been
able to compare the predictions of SBBN with other strin-
gent constraints, resulting from the estimates of the baryon
density from the satellites devoted to measuring the cos-
mic background radiation, WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe, Spergel et al. 2003) and the more recent
Planck mission (Planck Collaboration et al. 2011). Under
the assumption of SBBN and of a neutron lifetime of ∼880 s
(Beringer et al. 2012), the baryon densities provided by the
WMAP or the Planck experiments imply a primordial he-
lium abundance of Yp=0.2467±0.0006 (Spergel et al. 2007;
Planck collaboration XIII 2016). The He abundances deter-
mined by us for DDO 68 are therefore compatible with the
primordial value from WMAP or Planck within the quoted
uncertainties.

5.2 Spatial distribution of oxygen abundance

We have analysed the spatial distribution of the oxygen
abundances inferred for our H ii regions looking for signa-
tures (or lack thereof) of the interactions with the galaxy’s
satellites. Table 4 and Figure 5 show that there is no clear

dance by number in DDO 68’s H ii regions (black squares) com-
pared with literature values for other metal-poor star-forming
galaxies. The blue triangles are the low-metallicity H ii regions
galaxies from Izotov et al. (2007), where we have highlighted the
value inferred for IZw18 with the large magenta triangle; the large
red circle corresponds to the helium mass fraction inferred by
Skillman et al. (2013) for Leo P.

5 ABUNDANCES AND ABUNDANCE RATIOS

OF H II REGIONS

As described in Section 2 and shown in Figure 1, Reg. 8
is close to the galaxy centre, Reg. 7 and Reg. 9 lie on the
cometary tail that is often considered the accreted satellite
of DDO 68, while Reg. 1, Reg. 3 and Reg. 4 design the
ring-like structure which might be either the head of the
comet/satellite or the periphery of the main body. We can
thus try to use the abundances listed in Table 3 to get in-
formation on the evolutionary status of DDO 68, in terms
either of a single galaxy or of two merged bodies.

5.1 Helium

Since the pioneering work by Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert
(1974), the helium abundance derived from spectroscopy
of the H ii regions in low-metallicity star-forming dwarfs
has been considered as the best tool in the quest of the
primordial helium abundance, and therefore an important
test of the predictions of standard big bang nucleosynthesis
(SBBN, e.g., Yang et al. 1984). However, to make inferences
on the SBBN, the primordial helium abundance must be
inferred with an accuracy better than one percent, which
is highly challenging, as widely discussed in the literature
(e.g. Olive & Skillman 2004; Izotov et al. 2007; Aver et al.
2011). XMPs are extremely valuable for the determination
of the primordial helium abundance, since the extrapolation
of the He/H vs O/H distribution, or its mass fraction ver-
sion ∆Y/∆Z, to zero metallicity is minimal. For instance,
from their samples of H ii regions in low-metallicity galax-
ies, Izotov et al. (2014) ﬁnd YP = 0.255 ± 0.002 (statistical
+ systematic error), Aver et al. (2013) infer YP = 0.2465 ±
0.0097, and Fern´andez et al. (2018) ﬁnd YP = 0.245 ± 0.007,
marginally consistent with each other within the errors.

The extremely low oxygen abundance of DDO 68 makes
it a key object in the deﬁnition of the actual slope of
He/H with O/H, that has been the subject of hot debates
over decades (see, e.g., Izotov et al. 2007; Peimbert et al.
2007, and references therein). What is measured from the
H ii region spectra is the abundance by number of helium

evidence for the presence of a metallicity dichotomy in
DDO 68, which could indicate a recent merging between two
systems with very diﬀerent initial metallicities. In particu-
lar, from an analysis of the color-magnitude diagram of the
resolved stars, Tikhonov, Galazutdinova, & Lebedev (2014)
claimed the presence of two diﬀerent metallicity components
of ∼1/4 and ∼1/16 solar, belonging to the main system and
to the accreted companion, respectively. However, from our
H ii region analysis we do not ﬁnd compelling evidence for
two distinct metallicity populations in DDO 68, and in par-
ticular we do not detect a component as high in metallicity
as ∼1/4 solar (although there is no direct O abundance mea-
surement in the most internal Reg. 8).

Rather than two separate metallicity populations, our
analysis suggests the presence of a “smooth” trend of de-
creasing metallicity from the galaxy center outwards. This is
observed both for the direct-method abundance sample and
for the indirect-method one. In Figure 5 the oxygen abun-
dance has been plotted as a function of the distance from
the galaxy centre, deﬁned as the point of maximum light
density (inferred from our HST and LBT imaging) and in-
dicated by a cross in Figure 1. The top panel of Fig. 5 shows
the abundance results obtained in this work with the direct-
Te method, complemented by direct-method abundances of
DDO 68 from the literature (Izotov & Thuan 2007, 2009).
The linear ﬁt to the combined sample provides a slope of
−0.06 ± 0.03 dex/kpc. In the bottom panel of Fig. 5 we show
instead the results obtained in this work with the Yin et al.

(2007) and Pilyugin & Grebel (2016)’s indirect-method cal-
ibrations (see Section 4.1). The separate ﬁts to the Yin et
al. and Pilyugin & Grebel abundance sets provides slopes
of −0.12 ± 0.03 dex/kpc and −0.10 ± 0.04 dex/kpc, steeper
than the direct-method. Notice that the steeper gradients
obtained with the indirect methods may be due to a poor
calibration of the empirical relations at 12 + log(O/H)<7.1,
as already discussed in Section 4.1. In conclusion, we get ev-
idence for a negative metallicity gradient in DDO 68, with
∆log(O/H)/∆R in the range −0.06 to −0.12 dex kpc−1, and
no obvious chemical signature of a merging in our data.

In the past, metallicity gradients were considered
quite small, or even absent, in dwarf galaxies (see, e.g.,
Skillman et al. 2013, and references therein). However, un-
til recently, very few, sometimes only one, H ii regions were
usually observed in galaxies outside the Local Group. Fur-
thermore, uncertainties on the derived abundances could
be quite large in absence of high signal-to-noise spectra.
Gradients have been found in star-forming dwarfs when
modern multi-object spectrographs have allowed people
to measure with signiﬁcantly improved accuracy several
H ii regions per galaxy (Annibali et al. 2015; Pilyugin et al.
2015; Annibali et al. 2017), which suggests that others may
have gone undetected for lack of appropriate data rather
than for actual absence.

For comparison with other literature studies it is use-
ful to express the metallicity gradient in DDO 68 as a
function of the isophotal radius R25. Adopting R25 = 1.3′
from de Vaucouleurs et al. (1991) and D=12.7 Mpc from
Sacchi et al. (2016), we obtain R25 = 4.95 kpc; the metal-
licity gradients are therefore −0.30 dex R−1
25 (direct method)
and −0.59 dex R−1
25 (indirect method). For comparison, the
metallicity gradients obtained with the direct method in
the dwarfs NGC 4449 and NGC 1705 are −0.29 ± 0.08
25 (Annibali et al. 2017) and −0.33 ± 0.08 dex R−1
dex R−1
25
(Annibali et al. 2015), similar to the value obtained for
DDO 68. Using a combination of direct and indirect-method
abundances, Pilyugin et al. (2015) found gradients in the
range −0.04 ± 0.04 to −0.36 ± 0.11 dex R−1
for a sam-
25
ple of 14 irregular galaxies, compatible with our direct-
method gradient of DDO 68, but signiﬁcantly ﬂatter than
the value obtained with the indirect method. Spiral galaxies
display gradients too; using the indirect method calibration
of Pilyugin et al. (2012), Zinchenko et al. (2016) found, for
a sample of 88 disc galaxies in the CALIFA survey, gradients
in the range between -0.07 and -0.30 dex R−1
25 , with a few ex-
ceptions with gradient -0.64 dex R−1
25 . Thus, the metallicity
gradient in DDO 68 is consistent with the steepest values
derived in spiral galaxies.

5.3 Abundance Ratios

Figure 6 shows the distribution of the abundance ratios
Ne/O, S/O and Ar/O as a function of the oxygen abun-
dance (direct method). The black squares correspond to the
values we have derived for DDO 68’s H ii regions, while the
other symbols show the corresponding literature values for
other metal-poor dwarfs. Neon, sulfur, and argon are all pro-
duced by the same massive stars that produce oxygen; hence,
their abundance ratios to oxygen are expected to be inde-
pendent of the oxygen abundance. This is indeed the case

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2018)

also in DDO 68, whose ratios lie all on the lower oxygen
tail of the ﬂat distribution inferred for the other dwarfs (see
references in the caption to Fig. 6). In this respect, although
extremely oxygen-poor, DDO 68 behaves well, following the
same average trend as the other galaxies.

Vice versa, DDO 68 does not appear to follow the gen-
eral trend for what concerns nitrogen. Figure 7 shows the
N/O ratio vs O/H in our H ii regions (black ﬁlled squares)
and in those of the same large sample of star-forming
dwarf galaxies plotted in Fig. 6. While the very metal poor
galaxy IZw 18, with its log(N/O)∼ −1.6, lies exactly on the
tight plateau identiﬁed by Izotov & Thuan (1999) for XMPs
(i.e., galaxies with 12+log(O/H)≤7.2), all the DDO 68’ s
H ii regions have even lower oxygen but signiﬁcantly higher
N/O, thus suggesting a hint of reverse trend with respect to
that described by less metal-poor galaxies.

The N/O vs O/H diagram has been used to discuss the
primary vs secondary nature of nitrogen for decades. A pri-
mary element is one (like oxygen) that can be synthesised in
stars directly from primordial compositions, whereas a sec-
ondary element can be produced only in stars that at birth
already contain seed/catalyst elements heavier than helium.
As described by, e.g., Tinsley (1980, and references therein),
the canonical prediction for the abundances of secondary
elements is that they increase as the square of primary
abundances; hence, a secondary/primary abundance ratio
is expected to scale linearly with the primary element abun-
dance. The circumstance that N/O seems proportional to
O/H in all galaxies with 12+log(O/H)≥7.5−8.0 (e.g., Pagel
1985; van Zee et al. 1998), led people to conclude that ni-
trogen is a secondary element, a conclusion in agreement
with standard stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions that re-
quire catalyst carbon to produce N. However, already forty
years ago, Lequeux et al. (1979) argued that the behaviour
of the N/O ratios observed in a few irregular and blue com-
pact galaxies should be ascribed to a non negligible frac-
tion of primary nitrogen. Indeed, in 1981, Renzini & Voli
(1981) showed that nitrogen can be synthesised as a pri-
mary element in favourable conditions, namely, when deep
convection brings the seeds necessary for the nitrogen pro-
duction to the appropriate stellar layer, even if they were
not present in the original composition but were synthe-
sised in the stellar core during earlier evolutionary phases.
In practice, they demonstrated that, in the Hot Bottom
Burning (HBB) evolutionary phase of intermediate mass
stars, nitrogen is synthesised during their hydrogen-envelope
burning, using as catalyst the carbon previously produced
in the core of the same star. The existence of a primary
(minority) fraction of N was conﬁrmed by the combina-
tion of chemical evolution models with H ii region obser-
vations in the Milky Way and other spiral and late-type
galaxies (e.g., Matteucci & Tosi 1985; Diaz & Tosi 1986;
Vila-Costas & Edmunds 1993; Marconi et al. 1994). In par-
ticular, it was shown that N/O is both observed and pre-
dicted to be rather ﬂat across individual galaxies even in
the oxygen-rich regime, although it increases with O/H from
one galaxy to the other.

A further challenge to the interpretation of nitro-
gen’s nature came from the N/O vs O/H diagram when
people (see, e.g., Garnett 1990; Kobulnicky & Skillman
1996; Izotov & Thuan 1999) suggested that in the lower
oxygen regime log(N/O) shows a plateau. In particular,

11

Izotov & Thuan (1999) proposed that XMPs have a plateau
at log(N/O)≃ −1.6. Even invoking a signiﬁcant fraction
of primary nitrogen from HBB, this evidence was diﬃ-
cult to reconcile with standard nucleosynthesis predictions
where oxygen is enriched much earlier than nitrogen be-
cause it is produced by massive, short-lived stars, while
N should come from intermediate-mass, longer-lived ones.
As a way out of this issue, Izotov & Thuan (1999) sug-
gested that nitrogen could not only be primary but also
be produced by low-metallicity massive stars, as partly
envisaged by Timmes, Woosley, & Weaver (1995). Indeed,
Maeder & Meynet (2001) new stellar evolution models with
rotation provided a theoretical support to this suggestion,
since they predicted signiﬁcant nitrogen enhancements in
massive stars, with the N excesses being larger at larger
stellar luminosities and at lower metallicity.

Now, we might be facing a new challenge, since the
log(N/O) we derived in all DDO 68’s H ii regions is deﬁnitely
higher than −1.6. The interesting point is that DDO 68 is not
a lonely outlier, but shows almost exactly the same high ratio
(red circle in Fig. 7) inferred for Leo P (Skillman et al. 2013),
another XMP, and for few other low-metallicity systems (see
e.g., Nava et al. 2006; van Zee & Haynes 2006; Izotov et al.
2009). Skillman et al. (2013) discussed at length the appar-
ent inconsistency of Leo P’s N/O with Izotov & Thuan’s
plateau, posing key questions, but without reaching ﬁrm
conclusions: is there actually a plateau or is it there a signiﬁ-
cant scatter (whether intrinsic or observational) as suggested
by Garnett (1990)? Are there systematic diﬀerences between
emission line galaxies and relatively quiescent dwarfs? Does
Leo P show high N/O because it is observed during a long
period of relative quiescence in which N enriches the medium
but O does not, as in the time delay scenario proposed by
Garnett (1990)?

We do not have conclusions either, but we agree with
them that in DDO 68, as in Leo P, the current SF activity,
although present, is much lower than in the XMPs that de-
ﬁned Izotov & Thuan (1999) plateau (IZw18, SBS1415+437,
SBS0335-052). Its has been suggested (e.g., Pilyugin 1992;
Henry et al. 2000) that the observed N/O ratio can be used
as a “clock” to indicate the time since the most recent burst
of star formation, due to the delayed release of N into
the ISM compared to O. Since the highest activity of SF
in DDO 68 has occurred between ∼10 and ∼300 Myr ago
(Sacchi et al. 2016), is it possible that the high N/O ratio
measured there is due to a substantial nitrogen enrichment
from the population of intermediate-mass stars, compared
to a relatively lower oxygen enrichment from the less active
recent SF?

Or, given the strong dependence on rotational veloc-
ity and metallicity of the nitrogen primary production in
massive stars (Maeder & Meynet 2001), could it be that in
these XMPs N is actually produced in stars more massive
than the O-producers, and is thus released to the surround-
ing medium earlier than O? In other words, could we invoke
a reversed time-delay model in XMPs, with N/O decreasing
for increasing O/H? The most conservative option would
be to attribute the high N/O (and the high He/H) to the
presence of Wolf-Rayet stars close to our H ii regions, fol-
lowing the argument by Fern´andez et al. (2018). Indeed, a
broad He IIλ4686 feature, possibly due to the presence of
WR stars, is detected in Reg.3.

DDO 68: abundances and velocities

13

For comparison, the HI velocities as inferred from the ve-
locity contours displayed in Fig. 2 of Cannon et al. (2014)
are ∼480 km/s for Reg. 7 and ∼530 km/s for Reg. 1 and
3, consistent with our values. For Reg. 4, the HI velocity is
∼525 km/s, while we ﬁnd a lower velocity of 508±4 km/s. For
Reg. 9, the HI velocity is ∼510 km/s versus our H ii region
value of 519±7 km/s, while for Reg. 8, the innermost one,
the HI velocity is ∼505 km/s versus our lower value of 487±6
km/s. Therefore we conclude that, on a ﬁrst approxima-
tion, the ionized gas kinematics trace the behaviour of the
HI; small deviations from the HI behaviour are nonetheless
present, which is not surprising since H ii region peculiar
velocities, caused by e.g. expanding shells, can signiﬁcantly
distort the disk velocity ﬁeld due to the relatively small am-
plitude of DDO 68 ’s rotation curve (Vc = 45 km/s at 11 kpc
radius, Cannon et al. 2014). Indeed, Pustilnik et al. (2017)
suggested that the arrangement of H ii regions in a ring-like
structure in the head of the comet is due to the feedback
eﬀect from a supergiant shell expanding at a velocity of ∼13
km/s.

As mentioned in the introduction, Annibali et al. (2016)
presented an N-body simulation of three interacting galaxies
that, under a given line of sight, is able to reproduce the
morphology of the tail, the stream and the arc in DDO 68.
With the new information from our derived radial velocities,
combined with literature studies of the ionized and HI gas,
we will be able to perform new better-constrained dynamical
simulations of the DDO 68 system.

7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented LBT/MODS spectroscopy of
six H ii regions in DDO 68, two candidate companion galax-
ies, and one candidate star cluster. Our target H ii regions
cover all the main components of the DDO 68 system
(namely: main body, cometary tail and northern ring), ex-
cept the small stream discovered by Annibali et al. (2016),
whose objects are too faint for spectroscopy even with the
LBT. Both the galaxies and the candidate cluster turned
out to be background galaxies.

We conﬁrm the extremely low metallicity of DDO 68
and furthermore provide the ﬁrst direct-method abun-
dance measurement in the “tail” (Reg. 7); here we de-
rive a metallicity as low as 12+log(O/H)=6.96±0.09, po-
tentially lower, within the uncertainties, than that of the
record-holder galaxy J0811+4730, whose oxygen abundance
is 12+log(O/H)=6.98±0.02 (Izotov et al. 2018).

As a consequence, we conﬁrm that DDO 68 is an ex-
treme outlier in the luminosity-metallicity relation. Fig-
ure 8 shows the relation as inferred from the data by var-
ious authors and our DDO 68 values for Reg. 1, 3 and
7, all obtained with the direct Te method; DDO 68’s ab-
solute B magnitude is MB = −15.9, computed adopting
B=14.69 (Taylor et al. 2005), a foreground extinction of
AB = 0.08 (Schlegel et al. 1998), and a distance modulus
of (m − M)0=30.52 (Sacchi et al. 2016). The average oxy-
gen abundance inferred for DDO 68’ s H II regions is a
factor of ∼ten lower than expected for its luminosity. We
also show in the ﬁgure a hypothetical central abundance for
DDO 68 obtained by extrapolating the linear ﬁt in Fig. 5 to
R=0; even this value is signiﬁcantly below the luminosity-

6 RADIAL VELOCITIES

Radial velocities were derived from the most prominent
emission lines in the spectra. We derived mean velocities
averaging the Hδ, Hγ, Hβ and [O III]λλ4959,5007 lines in
the blue MODS channel, and the He Iλ5876 and Hα lines
in the red channel. The operation was performed separately
for the MODS1 and MODS2 spectra, for a total of four ve-
locity estimates for each region. The velocity measurements
turned out to be more accurate (as quantiﬁed by the stan-
dard deviation) for the red channel than for the blue one,
and for MODS2 than for MODS1. The red and blue channel
velocities typically agreed within the uncertainties.

The ﬁnal velocities were then computed as the weighted
mean of the four diﬀerent values, and we adopted the
weighted standard deviation as our velocity uncertainty. The
derived velocities were transformed into heliocentric ones us-
ing the rvcorrect task in IRAF. The results are provided
at the end of Table 2. The velocities derived for our six
H ii regions range from 479±1 km/s to 522±1 km/s. For
comparison, systemic velocities for DDO 68 derived in the
literature from neutral and ionized gas are in the range
Vsys ∼500−510 km/s (Ekta, Chengalur & Pustilnik 2008;
Cannon et al. 2014; Moiseev 2014).

It is useful to compare our results with the velocity map
of the ionized gas derived by Moiseev (2014) for DDO 68 (see
their Fig. 1). Moiseev (2014) found a velocity gradient in the
north-south direction, with V − Vsys ranging from ∼-40 km/s
to ∼+40 km/s from the“tail” to the“head” of the comet. This
behaviour is consistent with the rotation observed in the
HI (Ekta, Chengalur & Pustilnik 2008; Cannon et al. 2014),
and indicates that neutral and ionized gas rotate in the same
direction. Our velocity measurements are consistent with
this trend since the most external Reg. 7 exhibits the lowest
radial velocity (479±1 km/s), whereas the highest velocity
(522±1 km/s) is found in Reg. 3 in the head of the comet.

metallicity relation, by a factor of about 5. If we attributed
the H ii regions to a secondary acquired body with mass,
and hence luminosity, ten times lower that DDO 68, and
thus shifted them to the left, they would still remain out-
side the plot area occupied by the other galaxies (see arrows
in Fig. 8), with only the extrapolated central value being
marginally consistent with the relation.

From synthetic CMDs, Sacchi et al. (2016) derived a to-
tal stellar mass of ∼ 108 M⊙ for DDO 68, which allows us to
explore the position of this galaxy on the mass-metallicity
(M-Z) relation; taking as reference the distribution of galax-
ies in Fig. 8 of Berg et al. (2012), we conclude that DDO 68
is an outlier also in the M-Z relation. It is worth recall-
ing that the other known XMPs do not deviate from the
overall relations. Also Leo P (Skillman et al. 2013), which
is somewhat similar to DDO 68 for what concerns the low
metallicity and the high N/O, is perfectly aligned with the
other dwarfs (Berg et al. 2012), thanks to its much lower
luminosity (and mass).

The overall interpretation of the luminosity - metallic-
ity relation is that late-type dwarfs with higher gas fractions
and lower masses are more ineﬃcient at chemically enrich-

ing their medium, both because they have proportionally
larger amounts of gas to pollute and because they have more
chances to lose their metals through galactic winds, due to
their lower potential well (e.g., Chisholm et al. 2018). This
scenario can still apply also to DDO 68, but the question is
why has its enrichment been so less eﬃcient than the others.
How did DDO 68 components manage to get rid of most of
the oxygen produced by their stars? Or to dilute it with ex-
ceptional amounts of primordial external gas? In the past,
some (Izotov & Thuan 1999) suggested that XMPs are ex-
periencing now their ﬁrst burst of star formation, and have
not had time to signiﬁcantly enrich and mix their medium.
However, we now know that this is not the case for any of the
dwarfs studied with deep HST photometry in the local Uni-
verse (see, e.g., Tolstoy, Hill & Tosi 2009; McQuinn et al.
2010; Weisz et al. 2011, and references therein), all of which
clearly contain stars as old as the lookback time reachable at
their distance. In particular, DDO 68, as well as IZw18 and
all the other XMPs within ∼18 Mpc, hosts also RGB stars,
i.e. stars at least 2-3 Gyr, possibly 13 Gyr old (Aloisi et al.
2007; Sacchi et al. 2016). The SFHs derived from our HST
photometry by Sacchi et al. (2016) and, independently, by
Makarov et al. (2017) agree that the system has been form-
ing stars since the oldest epochs, although at a quite low
rate until a few hundred Myr ago; hence oxygen must have
been synthesized.

Thanks to the space distribution of our targets, we have
been able to detect a dependence of the oxygen abundance
on the distance from the galaxy center, whose linear ﬁt slope
∆log(O/H)/∆R is in the range −0.06 to −0.12 dex kpc−1, or
−0.30 to −0.59 dex R−1
25 , with the ﬂatter values from the di-
rect Te method, and the steepest ones from the indirect one.
Unfortunately, the sample is too small to assess whether this
dependence is actually a metallicity gradient similar to those
observed in all spiral galaxies (see, e.g., Wilson & Rood
1994; Sanchez et al. 2014, and references therein) and, re-
cently, in some star-forming dwarfs (Annibali et al. 2015;
Pilyugin et al. 2015; Annibali et al. 2017), or the result of
a yet incomplete mixing of DDO 68’s two merging bodies,
the main body and its satellite cometary tail (with or with-
out the head in the northern ring). A combination of the
two explanations is also possible, since born-in-situ gradi-
ents are the consequence of the spatial dependence of the
ratio between star formation history (i.e. element produc-
tion, usually higher in the inner regions) and infall of metal-
poor gas (i.e. element dilution, usually higher in the outer
regions), with the possible complication of galactic outﬂows
(element loss, where the potential well is suﬃciently low). At
any rate, the H ii regions in the tail have oxygen abundances
lower than most of the others, hence the oxygen gradient ob-
served in DDO 68 may be the consequence of the accretion
of both metal-poor gas and the metal-poorer satellite.

In a forthcoming paper (Romano et al. in preparation),
we will address the evolution of the system with chemical
evolution models taking into account the known SFH, the
possible interaction histories of the system and the N-body
simulations presented by Annibali et al. (2016), to try to
disentangle whether the anomalously low observed oxygen
is more likely due to the interactions, to unusually high
accretion of primordial gas, or to galactic winds. We will
furthermore investigate the reason for the high N/O ob-
served in DDO 68, trying to disentangle whether it can

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2018)

be explained with nitrogen enrichment from massive, low-
metallicity rotating stars, as predicted by stellar models (e.g.
Maeder & Meynet 2001; Meynet & Maeder 2002), or if the
reason is the age of the strongest burst occurred in DDO 68
(from ∼10 Myr to ∼300 Myr ago), combined with the delayed
production of nitrogen with respect to oxygen (Henry et al.
2000).

Finally, we measured radial velocities in the range 479±1
km/s to 522±1 km/s from the tail to the head of the “comet”
in DDO 68, consistent with the rotation derived in the H I
by Cannon et al. (2014).

APPENDIX A: LBT/MODS SPECTRA OF
TARGET REGIONS.

The LBT/MODS spectra of H ii regions 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 in
DDO 68, of the two candidate companion galaxies (Gal. 1
and Gal. 2), and of the candidate star cluster (CL) are shown
in Figures A1 to A8.

APPENDIX B: “RAW” EMISSION LINE
FLUXES

We provide in Tables B1 the emission line ﬂuxes, with no
reddening correction applied, for the six H ii regions studied
in DDO 68. The reported ﬂuxes were obtained by averaging
the results from MODS1 and MODS2, as outlined in Sec-
tion 3, with the associated uncertainties computed as the
standard deviation of the two diﬀerent measurements.
