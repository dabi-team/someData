Abstract To assess the degree of equilibration of the matter
created in heavy-ion reactions at low to intermediate beam
energies, a hadronic transport approach (SMASH) is em-
ployed. By using a coarse-graining method, we compute the
energy momentum tensor of the system at ﬁxed time steps
and evaluate the degree of isotropy of the diagonal terms and
the relative magnitude of the off-diagonal terms. This study
focuses mostly on Au+Au collisions in the energy range
√
sNN= 2.4-7.7 GeV, but central collisions of lighter ions
like C+C, Ar+KCl and Ag+Ag are considered as well. We
ﬁnd that the conditions concerning local equilibration for a
hydrodynamic description are reasonably satisﬁed in a large
portion of the system for a signiﬁcant amount of time (sev-
eral fm/c) when considering the average evolution of many
events, yet they are rarely fulﬁlled on an event by event ba-
sis. This is relevant for the application of hybrid approaches
at low beam energies as they are or will be reached by the
HADES experiment at GSI, the future CBM experiment at
FAIR as well as the beam energy scan program at RHIC.

1 Introduction

Heavy ion collisions are a mesmerizing tool to deepen our
understanding of how matter interacts, clumps and collec-
tively behaves at nuclear and hadronic scales. Experimen-
tal programs, like HADES at GSI[1], BES at RHIC[2] and
the upcoming NICA at JINR[3] and CBM at FAIR[4], aim
at exploring the QCD phase diagram[5, 6] in the high net
baryon density region, around the critical point. With the
aid of transport approaches like UrQMD[7, 8], PHSD[9, 10]
or SMASH[11], it is possible to derive phenomenological
predictions from the theory that can be quantitatively tested
in experiments. Hydrodynamic modeling[12] has been also

introduced in heavy ion collisions and, since the emerging
of robust evidences[13–16] that a medium was formed at
RHIC, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), with liquid-like prop-
erties and very low viscosity over entropy density ratio[17],
it has become an established framework to study the proper-
ties of the QGP[18–21], constantly improved with many re-
ﬁnements over the years[22]. Hybrid approaches combining
the advantages of transport and hydrodynamic approaches
have been developed, as well (see [23] for a review and ref-
erences therein). After the determination of the initial state
with various approaches[24–26], the evolution of the ﬁre-
ball created in heavy ion collision is described by hydrody-
namics, followed by a hadronic transport approach [27] to
perform hadronic rescattering and particle decays. Recently
hydrodynamics has been used also to interpret collective be-
havior observed at LHC in small systems like p-Pb or even
sNN≈
p-p[28, 29]. In the low collision energy regime (
2-10 GeV/fm3) 3 ﬂuid hydrodynamics[30] has been im-
plemented and deployed with results achieving a reason-
able description of experimental data [31]. Indeed, as of to-
day hydrodynamic modeling plays a crucial role in relativis-
tic heavy ion research. On the theory side, strong efforts
have been put in establishing the microscopic foundations
of relativistic hydrodynamics[32], in particular from kinetic
theory[33–35], consolidated, over the years, by comparisons
with parton cascade codes [36] like BAMPS [37] and in-
vestigations about the degree of consistency of the hydro-
dynamic approach [38] in the context of heavy ion colli-
sions [39–42].

√

However, most of these studies focused on high collision
energies and in this article we want to partially ﬁll this gap
by further elaborating, in a broader and systematic way, the
investigations presented in Ref.[43] in the low energy range.
It is possible to properly validate a macroscopic model like
hydrodynamics only if the underlying microscopic model
provides a sufﬁciently reliable description of the natural pro-

cesses on a smaller scale. Differently to the realm of heavy
ion collisions at high energies, like those achieved at RHIC [44]
or LHC [45], in which QGP medium formation is expected,
in the range of energies that we consider most of the time the
basic degrees of freedoms are hadrons, therefore a hadronic
transport approach provides a suitable benchmark for hy-
drodynamic models. The aim is to quantitatively investigate
how much of the system created in heavy-ion collisions is
close to thermal local equilibrium. This is a prerequisite to
apply hydrodynamics or hybrid approaches in the very low
beam energy domain. For this purpose the SMASH (Simu-
lating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) ap-
proach is employed to assess the properties of the local en-
ergy momentum tensor. In contrast to former works exam-
ining the degree of equilibration in a rather large central cell
lengths 4-5 fm [46–48], we deal with the whole volume of
the system at the nodes of a three-dimensional lattice with
resolution 1 fm by using a coarse graining method based on
smearing kernels. We focus mostly on Au+Au collisions at
Elab = 1.23 AGeV in the 0-5% centrality class, but we also
sNN= 7.7 GeV, we
explore the energy dependence up to
look at variations as a function of centrality and we ana-
lyze light and medium ion collisions like C+C, Ar+KCl and
Ag+Ag, again in the 0-5% centrality class and with beam
energy between 1.58 and 2 AGeV. The choice of the sys-
tems and energies matches the corresponding experiments,
mainly by the HADES collaboration.
The structure of this article is the following: after an intro-
duction to the SMASH transport approach, we illustrate the
criterion that will be used to assess the degree of thermal-
ization of the system, namely the pressure anisotropy and
the off-diagonality of the energy momentum tensor in the
Landau frame[49]. Then, we present and discuss the results.
In most cases, we evaluate the quantities by using the aver-
age energy momentum tensor of all events together, but we
also consider, in a few cases, the ﬁnal average of the out-
comes obtained by evaluating the energy momentum ten-
sor of the system on an event by event basis. To get a sim-
ple overall idea of the situation, ﬁrst we focus on the time
evolution of the energy density, the pressure anisotropy and
the off-diagonality in the central point of the system, then
along the planes parallel to the axes of the frame of refer-
ence passing through the center. Afterwards, we display a
few two-dimensional histograms of the distributions of the
same quantities at a ﬁxed time to provide an overview of
their typical values. We continue by showing the time evo-
lution of the volume of the system satisfying a set of con-
straints based on the aforementioned quantities and its ratio
with respect to the total system volume. In the next step,
we display some computations of time integrals of the vol-
umes satisfying a few sets of constraints, more extensively
summarized in the appendix. We also present some basic
topological characteristics of these volumes for a speciﬁc

case. Next, we summarize our ﬁndings in the conclusions.
In the appendix, in addition to providing a broader overview
of the results organized in several tables, we make basic as-
sessments about the impact of spectator hadrons, the use of
test particles and the differences and similarities to former
UrQMD results.
For obvious reasons of brevity, this article displays only a
small subset of the results obtained in the study, with thou-
sands of plots, which are currently available in full on the
website https://theory.gsi.de/~smash/hc1, together
with a description of the workﬂow to reproduce them, also
included in the ancillary ﬁles of the arXiv pre-print.

2 Methods

2.1 SMASH

SMASH[11] is a transport approach that simulates the time
evolution of a system of strongly interacting hadrons by us-
ing a semi-classical approach, i.e. the hadrons are treated as
point-like particles following deterministic trajectories, but
they scatter according to cross sections obtained from exper-
imental data or calculated from effective ﬁeld theories. How-
ever, even if a complete implementation of the spin degree of
freedom is not yet available, quantum features like nuclear
Fermi motion or Pauli blocking are included in the model.
SMASH includes almost all known hadrons and resonances
up to a rest mass of 2.4 GeV[50], it takes into account reso-
nance excitations and decays and it handles, by exploiting
Pythia[51, 52], color string formation and fragmentation.
The reliability of SMASH is supported by semi-analytical
tests[53, 54], by comparison with other codes[55, 56] and
with experimental data[57].
For this work we use SMASH version 2.0.2[58] in the cas-
cade mode and we compute the energy momentum tensor in
the Landau frame[49] at the nodes of a regularly spaced cu-
bic lattice aligned with the beam axis and the reaction plane,
with a side length of 75 fm, center coincident with that of
the colliding system, space resolution of 1 fm and time in-
tervals of 0.5 fm. The energy momentum tensor T µν and the
four currents jµ at the position r are evaluated as:

T µν = ∑

and pµ
i , γi, ui, pi and ri are respectively the four momen-
tum components, the Lorentz factor, the three velocity, the
momentum and the spatial position of the ith hadron in the
computational frame, while σ is a parameter that tunes the
smearing of the kernel. Indeed, different values of σ can
have a signiﬁcant impact on the results[43], nevertheless we
believe that SMASH default σ = 1 fm for all particles rep-
resents a reasonable choice, given the typical hadron ﬁnite
size and our lattice resolution. To reduce the computational
time, SMASH introduces a cut-off distance and the smear-
ing kernels are set to 0 if r − ri > 4σ . In this work we ne-
glect the effects of nuclear potentials, therefore the particles
contribute to the dynamical evolution of the macroscopic
properties of the systems only through elastic and inelastic
collisions. Since hydrodynamics only concerns the hot and
dense collision region, it makes sense to exclude from the
summations in Eqs. (1) and (2) the hadrons that do not inﬂu-
ence this evolution, i.e. the particles that never collided with
other particles, the so called “spectators”, and include only
“participants”, identiﬁed as those particles who had at least
one collision with another particle from the beginning of the
simulation until the moment of the T µν evaluation. In Ap-
pendix B we provide a limited assessment of the impact of
the spectators on the energy momentum tensor components.

2.2 Conditions for hydrodynamics

As we already mentioned in the introduction, it is beyond
the scope of this article to investigate and elucidate the the-
oretical foundations of hydrodynamics. As in Ref. [43], we

during the time evolution of the system, up to t = 40 fm, in
which the averages, denoted by the angle brackets (cid:104). . .(cid:105), are
taken over the events. The “L” subscripts in Eqs.4-7 serve as
a reminder that the energy momentum tensor T µν
is calcu-
lated in the Landau frame [49], but for the sake of brevity
we will not use them further. To avoid issues with low en-
ergy density regions, we consider only the lattice points in
which the denominators of these quantities are larger than
0.1 MeV/fm3, a condition approximately corresponding to
requiring a positive pressure.
We clarify that when we write X (Eq. 4) and Y (Eq. 5), we
refer to the evaluation of these quantities from the average
energy momentum tensor of a series of events, while, when
we write Xebe (Eq. 6) and Yebe (Eq. 7), we refer to the aver-
age of these quantities computed on an event by event basis.
X and Xebe, called pressure anisotropy, measure the degree
of pressure isotropisation of the system, while Y and Yebe,
called off-diagonality, measure the relative magnitude be-
tween the spatial off-diagonal and the diagonal components
of the energy momentum tensor.
If the system is in local thermal equilibrium then X,Y (cid:39) 0
and we can decompose the energy momentum tensor into:

T µν = εuµ uν − p(gµν − uµ uν ),

(8)

where ε and p are the energy density and the pressure in
the local rest frame, respectively, gµν the metric tensor (with
[+,-,-,-] signature) and uµ the ﬂuid four-velocity components.
By using an Equation of State to relate p, ε and possibly
the density ρ of a conserved current jµ and imposing con-
servation laws ∂µ T µν = 0 and ∂µ jµ = 0 one gets a closed
system of differential equations that constitutes the basis
of ideal hydrodynamics[22]. When the condition of local
thermal equilibrium is relaxed, i.e. X and Y are allowed to
be small, but non negligible, the decomposition in Eq.(8)
must include additional terms like the shear-stress tensor
π µν or, especially in the early phase of high energy ion
collisions, distinguish between longitudinal and transverse
pressure[59, 60]. This problem has been already addressed
by developing causally consistent and stable approaches[61,
62], successfully implemented in various viscous hydrody-
namics codes[63–67]. Nevertheless, the conceptual founda-
tion of the derivation of viscous hydrodynamics from the
microscopic kinetic theory relies on series expansions[33–
35] that assume moderate deviations from the condition of
local thermal equilibrium. Adding more terms in the ex-
pansion series can improve the accuracy of the model, but
it also signiﬁcantly increases the complexity of numerical
codes and their execution time, it requires the knowledge
of more transport coefﬁcients and, anyway, it has intrinsic

4

limitations[68]. It is very hard to deﬁne a precise limit on the
magnitude of X (Xebe) and Y (Yebe) to decide whether hydro-
dynamics can be safely applied[69], as it strongly depends
on the details of the hydrodynamic approach and its imple-
mentation, so in this study we evaluate how large the volume
of the system under a certain threshold is. More precisely,
we explore X,Y < 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 2, focusing mostly on the
intermediate case 0.3, but without endorsing this choice as a
“safe” or “limiting” one. As a general statement, the smaller
the threshold the closer to equilibrium is the system, while
for larger deviations a signiﬁcant difference between a hy-
drodynamic evolution and the SMASH calculation that is
valid off equilibrium is expected. Given the importance of
the energy density, from now on called ε, for the equation
of state [70–73] and the particlization process [74–76], most
of the time we introduce also three energy density thresh-
olds and we restrict our analysis to the regions for which
ε ≥ 1, 100, 500 MeV/fm3.

3 Results

Before entering the discussion of the results, let us start with
some technical remarks to explain in detail our setup for
the calculation. For the results that we are going to present
we use the center of momentum frame of the colliding ions,
with orthogonal Cartesian coordinates x, y and z. The axes
x and z span the reaction plane[77], with z parallel to the
beam direction. We use natural units, distance and time are
expressed in fm, while energy density and pressure are ex-
pressed in GeV/fm3or MeV/fm3. SMASH sets time t=0
fm at the moment in which two Lorentz contracted spher-
ical nuclei would touch in a perfectly central collision[11].
The various quantities are evaluated at the nodes of a lattice
with 1 fm uniform spacing along all three spatial directions.
When dealing with volumes, we assume that the values of
the quantities remain constant within the cubic cells of size
1 fm3 centered around the lattice points. When integrating
in space, we sum up the values at the centers of the cells
(dx = dy = dz = 1 fm), when integrating in time we sum up
and multiply by the time interval (dt = 0.5 fm).
For each type of conﬁguration, we perform 1080 events3, a
sort of trade-off between stability of the results[43] and time
needed to run the simulations. In most cases we focus on the
centrality class 0-5%, which is what we mean with “central”
collisions.

2The results on https://theory.gsi.de/~smash/hc include also
0.2.
3This number, 1080, instead of 1000 (103) or 1024 (210), is due to
technical reasons related to available RAM and CPUs.

3.1 Conditions in the center of the system

Before analyzing the properties of the whole system, it is
useful to look at the time evolution in its central region, at
coordinates x=y=z=0. The idea is to validate our methodol-
ogy by looking at rather well known features like the time
evolution of the energy density in the center of the ﬁreball.
Also, the middle of the system contains the highest density
of particles and therefore more homogeneous conditions.

3.1.1 Au+Au vs collision energy

As a ﬁrst step, we evaluate the time evolution of the energy
density in the center of the system for Au+Au ions at dif-
ferent collision energies in the 0-5% centrality class (im-
pact parameter b within the range 0-3.3 fm[78]), displayed
in Fig. 1. As expected, not only the maximum of the energy
density gets higher with increasing collision energy, but the
dynamics of the system gets faster, with maxima at earlier
times followed by a steeper decrease. However, as shown
in Fig. 2, if we consider the maximum value of the energy
density εmax and the corresponding time tmax and we rescale
the plot by using these quantities, we observe that the scaled
dynamics of the various systems is approximately the same
until it reaches the peak, while at later times it is more dif-
ferentiated. This behavior suggests that the time evolution
of the energy density of the system at its center during the
compression phase is driven by the energy deposit of the
participant nucleons, which on average are approximately
the same in all cases, while during the subsequent expan-
sion phase is determined by the chemical composition of
the system, the multiplicity of the particles and their cross
sections, which are non linearly dependent on the collision
energy and signiﬁcantly change across the ﬁve cases under
examination. The average pressure anisotropy Xebe, shown
in the upper half of Fig. 3, is rather large in ﬁrst fm/c, it ap-
proaches the maximum limit of 2 for very high collision en-
ergies (due to the fact that initially the longitudinal pressure
dominates over the transverse pressure), then it decreases
to a local minimum. The off-diagonality Yebe, shown in the
lower half of Fig. 3, follows a similar pattern, but with a
smaller initial peak and a more rapid growth at later times,
when the system becomes very diluted. We restrict the dis-
played time evolution to t = 25 fm, since afterwards the sys-
tem is too dilute to obtain meaningful results. In both cases
for Xebe and Yebe we observe that higher collision energies
have a larger initial peak and smaller values at late evolu-
tion times than lower energies. We remind that we accept as
part of the system only the points in which ∑i=1..3 T ii > 0.1
MeV/fm3, therefore the denominator in Xebe and Yebe is al-
ways positive. The absolute values at the numerators of these
quantities ensure that Xebe and Yebe are non negative and they
also explain some abrupt changes of directions in the plotted

5

curves when approaching the x axis. The same applies for X
and Y (Fig. 4), whose time evolution exhibits a behavior sim-
ilar to Fig. 3 in its ﬁrst phase, but strikingly different after
the system is somehow on average equilibrated, with values
that always remain relatively small for the whole time in-
terval under examination. However, as the collision energy
grows, the lower half of Fig. 3 reveals a tendency to leave
the equilibrium phase earlier, which is signaled by increas-
ing values of Y . The faster dynamics of the system leads to
a faster dilution.
In the rest of the paper we will focus mostly on X and Y be-
cause they provide more stable results and better conditions
for the applicability of hydrodynamics. Since hydrodynam-
ics is a theory of macroscopic averages, it is consistent to
also look at the transport dynamics as a coarse-grained av-
erage.

3.1.2 Au+Au vs centrality

The present study focuses on central collisions, neverthe-
less it is useful to include a basic evaluation of the role of
centrality. We limit our assessment to Au+Au collisions at
Elab= 1.23 AGeV and, in addition to the 0-5% centrality
class, we consider the 5-20% and 20-50% centrality classes
(impact parameter b within the range 3.3-6.6 fm and 6.6-
10.4 fm, respectively[78]). In Fig. 5 we show the time evolu-
tion of the energy density in the center of the system for the
three centrality classes under examination. We notice that
the magnitude of the energy density decreases with increas-
ing impact parameter, as it is naturally expected given the di-
minishing number of participant nucleons in the overlapping
region. Fig. 6 shows the time evolution of X (upper half) and
Y (lower half), which do not reveal signiﬁcant differences in
their magnitude. In the case of peripheral collisions, we ob-
serve a slightly delayed evolution of the system in the pres-
sure anisotropy due to geometric reasons and a tendency to
depart earlier from equilibrium in the off-diagonality due to
the formation of a smaller system.

systems will be further away from thermal equilibrium, be-
cause of the reduced number of binary collisions, that con-
stitute the mechanism to redistribute energy and momentum.
We perform this comparison among different systems for the
0-5% centrality class, determining the corresponding impact
parameters for the light ions by using an optical Glauber
model calculation, more speciﬁcally by exploiting a Mathe-
matica worksheet written by Klaus Reygers. The parameters
for these series of simulations are listed in Table 1.

If we look at the time evolution of the average pressure
anisotropy X, shown in the upper half of Fig. 8, after the ini-
tial equilibration process the values of this parameter in most
of the systems are within the reach of viscous hydrodynam-
ics, with the noticeable exception of C+C collisions, which
create a smaller and more quickly dissolving system, that at
15 fm is already very diluted, as one can deduce from Fig. 7.

ion species until the system starts going out of equilibrium,
a process that for Carbon ions happens already between 10
fm and 15 fm, while for Ar+KCl between 20 fm and 23 fm.
Overall we observe a clear dependence of the degree of the
system equilibrium on the atomic number of the colliding
ions, that is on the number of collisions within the system,
which, for small ions like Carbon, seems hardly sufﬁcient
to reach a good level of thermalization before the system
dissolves. On the other hand, the good agreement between
the predictions of the invariant mass spectrum of dielec-
trons produced in C+C collisions made with SMASH [57]
in vacuum and the experimental data [79] already suggested
that no thermal medium is formed in such a small system at
HADES.

3.1.4 Fluctuations in event by event simulations

Our preliminary survey restricted to the center of the system
indicates that, on an event by event basis, it is difﬁcult to
reach a high degree of thermalization. However, ﬂuctuations[82–
84] in the positions of the colliding nuclei might allow the
formation of regions with more isotropic conditions. We con-
sider the case of central collisions for Ag+Ag at Elab= 1.58
sNN=
AGeV, Au+Au at Elab= 1.23 AGeV and Au+Au at
7.7 GeV and, in addition to the average value, we consider
also the standard deviation from the average. In Fig. 9 we
show the time evolution of the energy density, noticing that
typical ﬂuctuations can deviate from the average value up to
roughly 20%. In the case of Xebe and Yebe, shown in Fig. 10,
ﬂuctuations are much broader, allowing, in some events, to
achieve favorable conditions for the applicability of hydro-
dynamics, nevertheless, as we will see later, typically only
within rather small and fragmented volumes.

We now take a step forward from the case of a single cell and
we explore the spatial distribution of the energy density, the

top to bottom, shows the spatial distributions of Xebe, X, Yebe
and Y . We remind that we consider as part of the system
the regions with the sum of the diagonal energy momentum
tensor components larger than 0.1 MeV/fm3, a rather broad
acceptance threshold that includes many “cold” cells with
very low energy density, so in ε plots a relevant part of the
system fades into the background. We notice that both Xebe
and Yebe have considerably larger values than the X an Y ,
thus demonstrating that the smoothing effect due to the av-
eraging process is not limited to the central points, but sig-
niﬁcantly affects the whole system, including the peripheral
regions. However, we remark that in general the peripheral
regions are still farther away from isotropic equilibrium than
the central ones. As already emerged in the case of the cen-
tral point and as already noted in Ref. [43], the averaging
process has a somehow larger impact on the off-diagonality
than on the pressure anisotropy. The likely explanation of
this effect is that the averaging process smooths down the
statistical ﬂuctuations due to the different initial positions
and momenta of the nucleons of the colliding nuclei. Nev-
ertheless the system has a natural special direction given by
the beam axis and while the average of the components of
the initial momenta along the x and y directions is ≈ 0, this
is not the case of the z component.

3.3 Correlations between pressure anisotropy,
off-diagonality and energy density

In addition to evaluate the presence of regions satisfying cer-
tain constraints in the systems formed in heavy ion colli-
sions, it is interesting to assess what are the typical values of
the constraints that delimit these regions and how they are
related to each other. We focus on Au+Au collisions at Elab=
1.23 AGeV, 0-5% centrality class, and examine the distribu-
tion of the values of ε, X, Y , Xebe, Yebe at t = 14 fm from
1080 events. For the histograms we use the ranges and num-
ber of bins reported in Table 2. We choose 10 MeV/fm3as
the lower edge of the energy density bins to avoid some dis-
turbing “noise” below this threshold in the event by event
case.

plot displays a pattern with an increasing number of vol-
ume elements with higher pressure anisotropy by decreas-
ing energy density, particularly steep between X=0.35 and
X=0.5. Fig. 12b shows how replacing Xebe with X dramat-
ically shifts the distribution towards X values below 0.2,
leading to a dense 2D histogram region for ε < 0.2 GeV/fm3,
with a secondary pattern that extends up to 0.8 GeV/fm3.

Fig. 12c and Fig. 12d, in which Xebe and X are replaced
by Yebe and Y , respectively, display characteristics similar to
the previous ﬁgures, but the damping effect due to the aver-
aging process on the non-diagonal terms of energy momen-
tum tensor is stronger than on the diagonal terms, resulting
in a dramatic shift of the dense region of the 2D histogram
from Yebe > 0.5 to Y < 0.2 for the most part.

Fig. 12e shows the two-dimensional histograms of the
volume elements of the system with respect to the average
Xebe and Yebe. We notice that the area Xebe < 0.3, Yebe < 0.4
is almost completely depleted, while for higher values these
quantities are indeed strongly correlated and follow closely
an almost linear relation (rough visual estimate without per-
forming a ﬁt: Yebe ≈1.5 Xebe), albeit with some sparse points
all around. The case of X and Y , shown in Fig. 12f, is sig-
niﬁcantly different: the previous pattern of Fig. 12e is re-
placed by a rather compact cluster at low values, in partic-
ular for X,Y < 0.3. In general, the expected trend that high
energy densities correlate with cells closer to local equilib-

3.4.1 Constrained fraction of the average system vs time

For the sake of brevity, here we report only the results for
Au+Au collisions at Elab= 1.23 AGeV in the 0-5% central-
ity class. As we anticipated in the ﬁrst section and as we
will discuss again in section 3.4.3, we expect to see roughly
similar qualitative effects for other energies, centralities and
system sizes, with some relevant deviations only in the case
of the tiny C+C system. We focus on the energy momen-
tum tensor from averaged 1080 events. Fig. 13 shows the
time evolution of the fraction of the total system for cen-
tral Au+Au collisions at Elab= 1.23, 3.4, 8, 12 AGeV and
√
sNN= 7.7 GeV, under the constraints X,Y < 0.3 and ε > 1
MeV/fm3. We notice that, after an initial equilibration phase
which is shorter for more energetic collisions, most of the
volume satisﬁes the imposed constraints. Lower collision
energies reach higher maximum percentages than higher col-
lision energies.
Fig. 14 shows again, for the same collection of systems, the
time evolution of their fraction subjected to the constraints
X,Y < 0.3 and ε > 500 MeV/fm3. We notice that the higher
energy density threshold dramatically reduces the eligible
fraction of the system, whose peak decreases for decreas-
ing collision energy. Due to the rapid cooling of the system,
which is faster for more energetic collisions, already before
20 fm no system has any region that satisﬁes the given con-
straints anymore.
Fig. 15 shows the centrality dependence of the time evolu-
tion of the fraction of the system satisfying the constraints
X,Y < 0.3 and ε > 1 MeV/fm3for central Au+Au collisions
at Elab= 1.23 AGeV. We notice that there is a rather weak

11

dependence on the centrality class and that in more periph-
eral collisions, somehow counter intuitively, the fraction of
the system that fulﬁlls the given conditions at later times is
larger than in the more central ones.
Fig. 16 shows the time evolution of the fraction of the system
satisfying the constraints X,Y < 0.3 and ε > 1 MeV/fm3for
the reactions in Table 1. We notice that even in small sys-
tems like C+C there is an interval of time in which most
of the system satisﬁes the set of constraints. We also notice
that the smaller the system, the shorter the time interval, the
earlier the formation time of the thermalized region and the
sharper its ending.

3.4.2 Dependence on the number of events

Fig. 17 shows, for central Au+Au at Elab= 1.23 AGeV col-
lisions, the fraction of the system satisfying the constraints
X,Y < 0.3 and ε > 1 MeV/fm3depending on the number of
averaged events. We notice that there is a strong dependence
on the number of events, with a non-uniform, but steady
growth of the fraction of the system satisfying the selected
constraints directly proportional to their number. Given the
huge variety of possible settings by changing the constraints
or the number of events, it is not possible to provide unique
indications or speciﬁc recommendations about how many
events one should average to have most part of the system
respecting the constraints. At the end of the day, the ﬁnal
choice relies on how much the hydrodynamic model can tol-
erate deviations from local thermal equilibrium, which are
reduced by considering more events, and how important is
to take into account ﬂuctuations in the initial conditions, that
instead are washed out by the averaging process.
From a practical perspective, since anyway many typical
experimental observables are obtained as averages of bil-
lions of events, using test particles[11] to compute the ini-
tial conditions for hydrodynamic simulations can be consid-
ered, to some extent, as a viable compromise with respect
to pure event by event simulations, with multiple instead of
single space momentum samplings of nucleons conﬁgura-
tion at the beginning of each event. This approach, which is
brieﬂy summarized in Appendix A and compared to the av-
erage of many events, has already proved to be very useful
in Ref. [85] to handle and smooth down the large inhomo-
geneities of nuclear potentials due to their divergent behav-
ior near the hadrons.
Looking at recent alternative approaches, we remark the ex-
istence of a few different stochastic hydrodynamics formal-
isms [86, 87], in which off-equilibrium dynamics is incor-
porated into noise terms, which are collecting growing inter-
est to deal with ﬂuctuations, in particular around the QCD
critical point [83, 88].

3.4.3 Integrated volumes

To get a more global picture that allows to directly compare
different systems to each other, the spatial volumes shown
above are now integrated over time. Fig. 18, which refers
to central Au+Au collisions at Elab= 1.23 AGeV, displays
the time integrals (up to t = 40 fm), of the volumes fulﬁll-
ing the constraints X,Y < 0.3 and ε > 1 MeV/fm3. Within
the same Au+Au ion species the 4D volumes are bigger for
more energetic collisions and smaller for more peripheral
collisions, in line with the expectations of the system size
dependence on beam energy and centrality. Yet we stress
that, despite being reasonable, this pattern is not obvious,
because we are dealing with volumes subjected to a series
of conditions whose effects are hard to foresee. In Fig. 19
we plot the ratio between the time integral of the volume of
the system satisfying the chosen constraints and the total un-
constrained volume, that presents a few interesting features.
First, we notice that all systems lay in the range 0.6-0.8, but
with a bit weird pattern. The ratio is already slightly above
0.6 for C+C and it increases when considering the Ar+KCl
system, but then decreases for Ag+Ag and Au+Au, possi-
bly suggesting that the effect of the decreasing beam energy
per nucleon dominates over the increasing atomic number.
Then, consistently with Fig. 15, we notice that the ratio in-
creases for more peripheral collisions. Finally, we observe
that at the remaining Au+Au collision energies the ratio re-
mains substantially stable.

3.5 Morphology of the regions suitable for hydrodynamics

We now investigate how much fragmented or compact the
connected regions of the system that satisfy a certain set of
constraints, from now on simply called “clumps”, are. This
investigation is motivated by practical purposes involving
the implementation of hydrodynamic codes. For example,
the reliability of the results could be limited when model-
ing a large cubic volume which contains “bubbles” or with
internal spinodal instabilities[89] (not treated in this work)
by assuming that ﬂuid description applies everywhere in-
side it. Moreover, in general numerical hydrodynamics need
speciﬁc assumptions at the borders of the grid in which the
ﬂuid is discretized and evolved. In particular, in the context
of heavy ion collisions, depending on the details of the par-
ticlization process[90], the morphology of the clumps might
have practical implications when dealing with transitions
between hydrodynamic and transport descriptions. In fact,
a proper handling of the interfaces between the two regimes
is more challenging in the case of a ﬂuid with a complex
topology, with highly fragmented clumps and cavities, very
irregular shapes and small volume over surface ratios than
in the case of regular, smooth hypersurfaces.

It is worth to mention that the size and the shape of a ho-
mogeneous thermal region can be related to ﬂuctuations and
causal correlations, which can be assessed with two parti-
cle correlation analysis and Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT)
interferometry[91–93].
We limit this morphological investigation to the event by
event case, because we have just seen in Section 3.4.3 that
when considering the average energy momentum tensor most
of the system satisﬁes the constraints X,Y < 0.3 and ε > 1
MeV/fm3, so in that case fragmentation should be a less
relevant phenomenon. Given the complexity of this topic,
we limit our analysis to three basic properties: the average
number of clumps that form in the system, the percentage
of clumps which is composed by just one cell and a very
rough estimate of their average compactness. The compact-
ness is deﬁned simply as the ratio between the volume of
the smallest parallelepiped with faces parallel to the coordi-
nate planes that encloses the clump and the volume of the
cells of the clump. It is clear that this deﬁnition has several
shortcomings, for example it does not provide any informa-
tion about the presence of cavities and it can be misleading
in the case of clumps having irregular shapes, for example
in the case of ﬁlaments, with very different outcomes de-
pending on how much they are straight or bent. Neverthe-
less, a value of the compactness close to zero should suggest
heavily fragmented, irregular clumps, while a value above
0.5 should qualitatively indicate the formation of relatively
compact regions, ruling out structures like bubbles with big
cavities inside or shapes like curly ﬁlaments. In determin-
ing this quantity, we consider only clumps composed by at
least 2 cells, so to avoid that single cell clumps, which have
by deﬁnition compactness 1 despite their small dimensions,
lead to an overestimate the average compactness. In Fig. 20
we show the number of clumps subjected to the constraints
Xebe,Yebe < 0.3 versus time in the case of central Au+Au col-
lisions at Elab= 1.23 AGeV. We notice that the ﬁreball con-
tains on average up to 9 distinct clumps at t (cid:117) 15 fm when
considering a minimum energy density ε >100 MeV/fm3.
This amount is reduced to roughly 4 clumps at t (cid:117) 12.5
fm for ε >500 MeV/fm3. The formation of clumps starts
earlier and ends later when the energy density constraint is
lower, as expected in a system that transits from an initial
phase of compression and heating to a phase of expansion
and cooling. From a practical point of view, the simultane-
ous presence of several separated clumps should encourage
to pay a special attention in the particlization process when
a freeze-out hypersurface for a phase transition in a hydro
code is deﬁned at these low energy densities, not only re-
garding a precise determination of the hypersurface[90] and
the enforcement of conservation laws[76], but possibly also
from the inﬂux of hadrons emitted by another clump that
adds to the negative Cooper-Frye contributions[94]. Fig. 21
shows the average fraction of clumps composed by just one

cell of 1 fm3 volume. We notice that clumps consisting of
single cells dominate when clumps start to form and when
they are dissolving. However, between 10 and 15 fm, more
or less when the number of clumps is at its highest, the frac-
tion of small clumps represents only 20% of the total. Fig. 22
show the average compactness of clumps, which tends to be
larger at the beginning and the end of their presence, when
they are smaller, than between 10 and 15 fm, when it goes
down to 0.5.

4 Conclusions

We used the SMASH hadronic transport approach to com-
pute the energy momentum tensor of the systems of hadrons
created in heavy ion collisions, neglecting nuclear potentials
and taking into account only the particles that collided at
least once. The average pressure anisotropy (Eq.4) and off-
diagonality (Eq.5) have been evaluated either from the av-
erage energy momentum tensor of all runs of a certain type
of system (X,Y parameters) or from the energy momentum
tensor of individual event by event simulations (Xebe,Yebe pa-

In general, we found that, on an event by event basis, on av-

constraints on Xebe and Yebe that can be considered suitable
for the application of hydrodynamics consistent with kinetic
theory. The situation changes dramatically when consider-

taining bulk dynamics predictions from hydrodynamics in
agreement with coarse grained transport models even during
the ions compression stage if a proper EoS is chosen[95]. On
the other hand, after an initial phase of equilibration the av-
erage energy momentum tensor across many (≈ 1 K) events
seems to posses an overall good degree of thermalization
that can extend to most of the system volume (provided that
the constraints on X, Y are not too tight), albeit it tends to
rapidly wane as the system expands and dilutes.
We brieﬂy address what we think might be the most rele-
vant concerns about this work. 1) We based our assessments
on the pressure anisotropy X(Xebe) and the off-diagonality
Y (Yebe) because we considered these quantities as the most
signiﬁcant. However, X(Xebe) and Y (Yebe) represent just the
basic pre-requisites and many aspects which are still relevant
for a successful implementation of a hydrodynamic model
were left out. 2) All the results are based only on SMASH
and they would be more robust if conﬁrmed by other trans-
port codes like UrQMD or PHSD, which have different con-
ceptual and implementation details. We present a very lim-
ited comparison with previous results [43] obtained with
UrQMD in Appendix C. 3) The impact of lattice resolution
has not been fully investigated, neither we assessed what
could be the optimal discretization scale for hydrodynamic
simulations, that commonly adopt grid spacing around 0.2
fm.
Other minor points, like the impact of spectators and the al-
ternative use of test particles are treated in Appendix B and
Appendix A, respectively, together with a few tables with
the time integrated volumes of the system satisfying a cer-
tain set of X(Xebe), Y (Yebe), ε criteria. We also recall that it
is possible to visualize many more plots, covering the full
combination of the parameters chosen in this study, on the

Appendix A: Test particles

SMASH is able to run simulations by using test particles, i.e.
by sampling Nt p times the number N of initial nucleons, but
scaling at the same time the cross section of all interactions

ing the average energy momentum tensor of many events.
In this work we focused on 1080 events and we found that,
after a relatively short initial phase in which the nuclei have
not completely penetrated each other, for some time most of
the system with energy density above 1 MeV/fm3is close
to local equilibrium, albeit this percentage then steadily de-
creases with time. When considering higher energy density
thresholds, like 100 or 500 MeV/fm3, the fraction of the
system suitable for hydrodynamics is considerably smaller
and, due to the rapid cooling of the ﬁreball, it dissolves
faster.
As one would naively expect, we found that the volume sat-
isfying given X, Y constraints decreases from central to pe-
ripheral collisions, nevertheless, when considering the ratio
with the total unconstrained volume, the fraction of the sys-
tem suitable for hydrodynamics can be even larger. We also
found that light ions central collisions almost never meet
the criterion for hydrodynamic applicability in the event by
event case, in particular for small systems like C+C, nev-
ertheless, when considering the average energy momentum
tensor of many events, the situation is more favorable, albeit
these systems tend to dissolve quickly.
In conclusions, our investigations suggest that, when consid-
ering a single event, in simulations at HADES - CBM - (low
end) BESII energies based on hydrodynamic approaches it
might be challenging to get results consistent with transport
models, like SMASH, because in most cases a very large
part of the system signiﬁcantly deviates from the local ther-
mal equilibrium condition. However, physical observables
are extracted from a collection of many events and this cir-
cumstance does not seem to hinder the possibility of ob-

by the same factor Nt p[11]:

N → NNt p,

σ → σ /Nt p.

(A.1)

This replacement does not change the scattering rate, i.e. the
number of interactions per particle per unit of time, nev-
ertheless it makes the system smoother and similar to the
average system obtained by running Nt p simulations with
the same impact parameter. We validate this statement for
Au+Au collisions at Elab= 1.23 AGeV in the 0-5% centrality
class by comparing the distributions of the pressure anisotropy
X and the off-diagonality Y on the plane z = 0 at t = 10
fm. The variability of the impact parameter hinders precise
quantitative assessments, nevertheless the small range of the
sampling still allows for qualitative comparisons. Fig. 23
shows the distributions of X and Y computed from the aver-
age energy momentum tensor of 1080 events, while Fig. 24
shows the distributions of X and Y computed from the en-
ergy momentum tensor of a single event with 1080 test par-
ticles. We notice that the magnitudes of X and Y are roughly
the same in both contexts. In general, SMASH needs more
time to simulate one event with Nt p test particles than Nt p
events without this approach, however in some circumstances
test particles might provide a convenient method to initialize
the energy momentum tensor in hydrodynamic simulations.

Appendix B: Impact of spectators

As already mentioned in the description of the procedures
followed in this study, we compute the energy momentum
tensor of the system by taking into account only the par-
ticipant hadrons, i.e. the hadrons that had at least one col-
lision after the starting time of the simulation. Since we
are neglecting potentials, interactions between hadrons hap-
pen only via collisions, therefore the particles that do not
collide, called spectators, do not inﬂuence the evolution of
the system. Nevertheless, we believe that it is interesting to
explore what is their impact on the components of the en-
ergy momentum tensor. To this aim, we consider again 1080
Au+Au collisions at Elab= 1.23 AGeV, in the 0-5% central-
ity class, and we inspect the distributions at time t = 10 fm
on the plane z = 0 of the pressure anisotropy X and the
off-diagonality Y of the average energy momentum tensor.
Fig. 1 shows that at time t = 10 fm the energy density in
the center has not reached the peak, yet, suggesting that the
main collision process between the nuclei is not yet com-
pleted, so it is expected a detectable effect by the spectators
that, because the lack of interactions, are likely to have an
higher level of anisotropy than the rest of the system. Ac-
tually, as Fig. 25 shows, the inclusion of the spectators in
the computation of the energy momentum tensor leads to a
signiﬁcant increase both of the pressure anisotropy X and

the off-diagonality Y with respect to the case in which only
participants are taken into account (Fig. 23).

Appendix C: Comparison with UrQMD results

Here we perform a brief comparison with the results ob-
tained with UrQMD in Ref. [43] for Au+Au collisions at
Elab= 80 AGeV with b = 6 fm, by using approximately the
same method as in the present work.
Fig. 26, to be compared with Fig. 6 in Ref. [43], shows the
time evolution of X at x = 0, 2, 6 fm and y = z = 0 fm. The
number of events is slightly different, 1080 in our case and
1000 in the reference, and we also remind that the deﬁnitions
of the initial time t = 0 fm are not the same in the two codes,
nevertheless in the present context these differences do not
impede a qualitative comparison. We notice that the most
relevant features of the pressure anisotropy, like an initial
maximum close to the theoretical limit of 2, the minimum
at 3 < t < 4 fm, the relative maximum at t (cid:117) 6 fm and the
following decrease are common to both ﬁgures. However, in
our case X seems to be slightly smaller and in the point at
x = 6 fm we do not observe any increase after the minimum
when compared with the two other points, as it happens in
the plot in the Ref. [43], but instead a small delay shift in the
proﬁle. The fact that SMASH results produce smaller X val-
ues probably explains why in Fig. 27 we obtain, for t (cid:39) 10
fm, a percentage of the system larger than 80% that fulﬁlls
the condition X < 0.3, while in the left part of the Fig. 3 of
the Reference it does not exceed 60% until t = 15 fm, except
for an initial peak at around t = 5 fm that in our case is barely
visible. We also notice that in Fig. 27 there is not much dif-
ference between the curves based on 1080 or 10800 events
only until t = 8 fm, while at later times 1080 events are not
sufﬁcient to saturate the results, as it is the case in Ref. [43].
Overall, our new results based on SMASH seem to be in
broad qualitative agreement with the old ones based on UrQMD,
however it is also clear that there are non negligible differ-
ences in the dynamics of the system between the two codes,
which, in the case of the second plot, are probably empha-
sized by ﬁxing a precise threshold, thus leading to differ-
ences in accounting up to 20% of the system volume below
that threshold.

Appendix D: Integrated volume tables

Here we provide some tables with the time integrated vol-
ume of the system simultaneously satisfying the constraints
on the pressure anisotropy: X(Xebe) < 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and on
the off-diagonality: Y (Yebe) < 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, for various mini-
mum energy density thresholds, i.e 1, 100 and 500 MeV/fm3.
The systems under consideration are listed in table 4. The
results in tables 5-9 refer to the average volumes V1, V100,
