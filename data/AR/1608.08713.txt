ABSTRACT
Until now, systematic errors in strong gravitational lens modeling have been acknowledged but have
never been fully quantiﬁed. Here, we launch an investigation into the systematics induced by constraint
selection. We model the simulated cluster Ares 362 times using random selections of image systems
with and without spectroscopic redshifts and quantify the systematics using several diagnostics: image
predictability, accuracy of model-predicted redshifts, enclosed mass, and magniﬁcation. We ﬁnd that
for models with > 15 image systems, the image plane rms does not decrease signiﬁcantly when more
systems are added; however, the rms values quoted in the literature may be misleading as to the ability
of a model to predict new multiple images. The mass is well constrained near the Einstein radius in
all cases, and systematic error drops to < 2% for models using > 10 image systems. Magniﬁcation
errors are smallest along the straight portions of the critical curve, and the value of the magniﬁcation
is systematically lower near curved portions. For > 15 systems, the systematic error on magniﬁcation
is ∼ 2%. We report no trend in magniﬁcation error with fraction of spectroscopic image systems when
selecting constraints at random; however, when using the same selection of constraints, increasing this
fraction up to ∼ 0.5 will increase model accuracy. The results suggest that the selection of constraints,
rather than quantity alone, determines the accuracy of the magniﬁcation. We note that spectroscopic
follow-up of at least a few image systems is crucial because as models without any spectroscopic
redshifts are inaccurate across all of our diagnostics.

1. INTRODUCTION
Since the discovery of the ﬁrst gravitationally lensed
arc in the ﬁeld of cluster Abell 370 nearly three decades
ago (Soucail et al. 1988), astronomers have been tak-
ing advantage of the lensing magniﬁcation boost from
massive galaxy clusters to observe the distant Universe.
Gravitational lensing has the advantage of achromatic-
ity, making spectral observations of these lensed objects
comparable to unlensed sources in the ﬁeld. Addition-
ally, the strong lensing evidence traces the total mass
distribution of the cluster, allowing for accurate recon-
structions of the projected mass density of clusters, es-
pecially on small scales (< 100 kpc), where other mass
tracing methods are sensitive, yet lack the resolution of
strong lensing. Lensing is sensitive only to mass and not
to gas physics that can contribute to the uncertainties of
mass scaling relations where the observable depends on
the state of the hot intercluster medium.

However, one of the largest challenges in exploiting
gravitational lensing remains in calibrating these “cosmic
telescopes.” Both strong and weak lensing methods have
been used extensively to measure the mass distribution
of galaxy clusters. Numerous weak lensing surveys have
allowed for a deep investigation into the statistical and
systematic errors of weak lensing methods (Massey et al.
2013; Applegate et al. 2014; Shirasaki & Yoshida 2014).
Similar analyses for strong lensing have lagged behind
those of weak lensing for two main reasons: (1) accurate
strong lens models require an exquisite image quality to
robustly identify multiple images (Kneib et al. 1996), and

tljohn@umich.edu

(2) the occurrence of strong lensing events is lower than
weak lensing, making it more diﬃcult to ﬁnd strong lens-
ing clusters to model. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
has been the primary workhorse for strong lensing obser-
vations since the installation of WFPC2. The probability
of ﬁnding strong lenses is indeed small (Bartelmann et al.
1998; Wambsganss et al. 2004); but as predicted, several
hundred strong lensing clusters have been found directly
in several optical surveys (Gladders et al. 2003; Hennawi
et al. 2008) and after optical follow-up of clusters found
in X-ray-selected (Postman et al. 2012) and Sunaev-
Zel’dovich eﬀect-selected clusters (Menanteau et al. 2010;
Bleem et al. 2015). Strong lensing mass estimates of the
cores of these clusters, when combined with other proxies
for mass at larger scales, will allow for measurements of
the mass-concentration relation of galaxy clusters (Gralla
et al. 2011; Oguri et al. 2012; Merten et al. 2015) across
a range of cluster masses and redshifts. These strong
lensing clusters highly magnify numerous galaxies from
the peak of cosmic star formation density around z = 2
(Bayliss et al. 2011), allowing for zoomed-in studies of
star formation at a time when the Universe produced
most of its stars (Madau & Dickinson 2014). Currently,
strong lensing clusters are our best chance of ﬁnding the
most distant galaxies at z > 8, which may be responsible
for re-ionizing the universe (Zitrin et al. 2014; Atek et al.
2015; Coe et al. 2015; McLeod et al. 2015, to name a
few). With the ever increasing number of known strong
lenses, it will be important to fully understand how well
we can quantify both the statistical and systematic errors
in modeling strong lensing galaxy clusters.

Estimating the statistical errors in strong lens mod-

eling has become nearly routine with the advancement
in lens modeling codes to utilize Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to adequately explore param-
eter spaces. The literature only mentions instances where
systematic errors have been revealed between diﬀerent
models of the same cluster or when comparing new mod-
els of a cluster to earlier and obsolete models. For ex-
ample, Smith et al. (2009) found that including redshift
information of the strong lensing constraints has a signif-
icant eﬀect on constraining the slope of the mass distri-
bution. Similarly, Johnson et al. (2014) found that the
magniﬁcation can vary beyond the statistical errors when
the redshift information is added for a single system.
Jauzac et al. (2015a) report an overall increase in mag-
niﬁcation values for their new model of Abell 2744 using
full-depth Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) data; this eﬀect
has many possible causes: adding dozens of new image
systems as constraints, including new spectroscopic red-
shifts, and/or correcting a misidentiﬁed image system.

While it is true that each individual method has its
own systematic errors, all modeling methods are sub-
ject to errors due to the availability of constraints. The
HFF clusters and Abell 1689, with a wealth of deep mul-
tiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy, have unprece-
dented numbers of image systems identiﬁed and have
some of the most precise lens models of clusters in exis-
tence (Jauzac et al. 2014, 2015a, 2016; Diego et al. 2015;
Kawamata et al. 2016; Treu et al. 2016). Yet, these clus-
ters are seven unique lensing sight lines; in fact, most
clusters only have a handful of multiple images (see Fig-
ure 1). This reality stems from a few factors: (1) the
aforementioned clusters are some of the most massive
clusters, many showing signs of ongoing growth through
mergers (Merten et al. 2011; Jauzac et al. 2015b), result-
ing in larger lensing cross-sections, (2) they have some
of the deepest HST data allowing for identiﬁcation of
fainter multiple image systems, and (3) they have exten-
sive spectroscopic campaigns that allow for the redshift
conﬁrmation of multiple image systems. Determining to
what degree systematic errors are induced upon a lens
model due to the availability of constraints is a high
priority, especially for lower mass clusters, which tend
to lens fewer multiple image systems or massive clusters
with shallow observations.

In this paper, we begin to address several questions
surrounding the topic of systematic errors in lens model-
ing. How does changing the number of constraining mul-
tiple image systems in a lens model aﬀect the accuracy
of strong lens models? Similarly, how does increasing the
number of spectroscopic redshifts inﬂuence a model’s ac-
curacy? These questions are timely in this new era of
strong lensing where high-quality data are allowing for
the most precise (i.e., low statistical uncertainty) models
with high numbers of identiﬁed lensing constraints. An-
swering these questions will help guide the lensing com-
munity’s focus to improve the quality of future strong
lensing models. Spectroscopic campaigns are expensive:
lensed galaxies, while magniﬁed, are still faint and re-
quire long integrations on large telescopes, thus, we must
determine their necessity for strong lens modeling. We
show that it is critical for strong lens models to have at
least a few spectroscopically conﬁrmed redshifts of image
systems to dramatically reduce systematic errors.

This paper is organized as follows. We begin with

a description of the experimental design in §2.
In §3
we discuss the common methods used in strong lens
modeling. We describe the ﬁducial lens model in §4
used for our analysis.
In §5 we describe our method-
ology for quantifying lens modeling systematics and re-
port the results in §6. Finally, we summarize our work
in §7 and discuss plans for future work in §8. We as-
sume a ΛCDM universe with ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7,
and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1. This cosmology yields an
angular-physical scale of 1(cid:48)(cid:48) = 6.104 kpc to the Ares clus-
ter redshift z = 0.5.

2. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The goal of this study is to investigate quantitatively
how the selection of strong lensing constraints, i.e., the
redshifts and multiple images of strongly lensed galax-
ies, aﬀect lens models. We do this by generating 350
test models of the same gravitational lens, each test
model uses a diﬀerent random subset of the available
constraints. The results of the test models are compared
to a ﬁducial model that uses the full set of constraints
as input. In this section, we brieﬂy describe our choices,
while a thorough discussion is given in the following sec-
tions.

The best-case-scenario ﬁducial model is a lens model
of the simulated cluster Ares, a model that was initially
computed for the purpose of the lens modeling compar-
ison challenge (Meneghetti et al. 2016). The ﬁducial
model is constrained by 66 lensed galaxies with known
redshifts. All test models will be compared to this ﬁdu-
cial model, which uses all lensing constraints and the true
redshifts of the sources.

The parameter space that is covered by the test models
is the number of lensed galaxies with spectroscopic red-
shifts, and the number of lensed galaxies without spec-
troscopic redshifts that are used to constrain the model.
Each of those parameters is varied between 0 and 25. For
each combination of parameters, we generate 10 models,
with diﬀerent galaxies selected randomly as constraints
in each one. The tested combinations of numbers of lens-
ing constraints with and without spectroscopic redshifts
cover scenarios similar to the HFF clusters, including
early pre-HFF models with a small number of constraints
and as low as three spectroscopic redshifts, to the rich-
est post-HFF data sets with hundreds of multiple images
and dozens of new spectroscopic redshifts.

We compare the test models on a few metrics:

im-
age plane rms as a measure of predictability of multi-
ple images, model-predicted redshifts of systems without
spectroscopic redshifts, mass distribution, and magniﬁ-
cation. The results are compared with the ﬁducial model,
rather than the simulation, in order to separate the sys-
tematic error induced by the constraints from other po-
tential sources of systematics. The systematic error be-
tween the ﬁducial model and simulation truth may be
sensitive to the exact modeling algorithm and parame-
terization choice, which is beyond the scope of this paper,
yet will be important to investigate. We refer the reader
to Meneghetti et al. (2016) for current work, comparing
diﬀerent lensing methods.

While we are only investigating this eﬀect on a sin-
gle method, this study is applicable to all strong lensing
methods. Despite the variety of lensing methods (i.e.,
parametric versus non-parametric, see below), all meth-

HFF observations (Johnson et al. 2014; Richard et al. 2014), while the yellow stars show the most complete lens models to date on clusters

?). We also include several other clusters from the literature, including those from the CLASH survey that do not overlap with the HFF
clusters (Zitrin et al. 2015). Other clusters include well-known lensing clusters such as Abell 1689 (Diego et al. 2015), the Bullet Cluster
(Bradaˇc et al. 2009), El Gordo (Zitrin et al. 2013), Abell 1703 (Limousin et al. 2008), Abell 2218 (El´ıasd´ottir et al. 2007), and many others
(Zitrin et al. 2011; Sharon et al. 2012, 2014, 2015; Bayliss et al. 2014; Richard et al. 2007, 2010, 2015).

ods are using the same lensing evidence to infer the mass
distribution.

3. STRONG LENS MODELING
While diverse in computational algorithms, all strong
gravitational lens modeling codes have a common goal:
solve the lens equation

βij = θij − αij

(1)

for the image plane positions θij of each multiply im-
aged background source that map to location βij in the
source plane. The solution is the deﬂection ﬁeld tensor
αij, which can be diﬀerentiated to solve for the projected
surface mass density Σ,

∇ijαij =

4πG
c2

Dls(zl, zs)
Ds(zs)

Dl(zl) Σ,

(2)

where Ds, Dl, and Dls are the angular diameter distances
between the observer and the source at redshift zs, be-
tween the observer and the lens at redshift zl, and be-
tween the lens and source, respectively. When the lens-
ing mass is contained to a single plane at zl, then the
deﬂection angle scales only with the lensing fraction

Dls
Ds

(zs) =

αij(zs)

(3)

which is a function of a single variable zs. Thus, it is

clear that both the image plane position θij and the
source redshift zs are needed to determine the full three-
dimensional lensing geometry needed to constrain Σ.

Strong lens modeling can include other observable
strong lensing eﬀects that constrain other ﬁrst- and
second-order derivatives of the lensing potential, includ-
ing time delays, magniﬁcation ratios between diﬀerent
images of the same source, and ﬂexion (distortion of the
background source). These methods can be implemented
in lens modeling codes, but are more prone to systematic
error from the uncertainty of the observations themselves
(i.e., lack of measured time delays, microlensing eﬀects
on magniﬁcation ratios, need for high-quality imaging for
shape measurements). Measuring a centroid of an image
of a lensed galaxy is straight-forward and typically the
error in position is smaller than the errors in lensing due
to cosmic variance and structure along the line of sight
(Limousin et al. 2007).

There are generally two schools of thought for lens
modeling codes: parametric and non-parametric meth-
ods. Parametric methods (e.g., Lenstool, Jullo et al.
2007; glaﬁc, Oguri 2010; gravlens, Keeton 2001; light-
traces-mass, Broadhurst et al. 2005 and Zitrin et al. 2009;
GLEE, Suyu et al. 2012; Suyu & Halkola 2010) assume
that the lensing potential and mass distribution of the
lens can be expressed as a superposition of parameterized
density distributions, and those parameters can be solved
from the lensing evidence. A common assumption for
these models is that mass distribution follows that of the

Johnson et al.

light (i.e., cluster member galaxies are assigned their own
halos); however, this assumption can be applied more
rigorously or loosely depending on the method. Non-
parametric methods (e.g., SWunited, Bradaˇc et al. 2008;
SaW lens, Merten et al. 2011; LensPerfect, Coe et al.
2008; WSLAP, Diego et al. 2005, 2007; Grale, Liesen-
borgs et al. 2010) make no assumptions about the mass
distribution and instead solve for each “pixel” in the sur-
face mass density of an adaptive grid with higher resolu-
tion near the constraints and peak of the density distri-
bution. Some codes have been hybridized to include as-
pects of both parametric and non-parametric techniques
(ex., Jullo & Kneib 2009).

4. THE FIDUCIAL LENS MODEL
4.1. The simulated cluster Ares
A full description of the Ares simulated cluster is given
in Meneghetti et al. (2016). In short, the Ares cluster
simulation is designed to mimic a massive cluster that
is an eﬃcient gravitational lens. The publicly available
software MOKA (Giocoli et al. 2012) is used to create
simulated lensing signals from clusters, including a num-
ber of scaling relations derived from N -body simulations,
a mass-concentration relation, a subhalo mass function,
and subhalo tidal stripping eﬀects on truncation radii.
The main cluster potential is composed of two triaxial
clumps with masses 1.8×1015 M(cid:12) and 1.3×1015 M(cid:12) fol-
lowing the Navarro-Frenk-White proﬁle (NFW; Navarro
et al. 1997), separated by ∼ 570 kpc, along with two
central cluster galaxies near the centers of these grav-
itational wells, which are modeled by triaxial proﬁles.
The galaxy-scale halos are modeled as singular isother-
mal spheres.

The baryonic component of Ares follows a halo-
occupation distribution (HOD) technique, where it is as-
sumed that the stellar mass of a galaxy is tightly corre-
lated with the depth of the gravitational potential well
that it occupies. The B-band luminosities are assigned
to each halo by MOKA using the relations described in
Giocoli et al. (2012), which follow closely with the results
by Wang et al. (2006). Then, a spectral energy distribu-
tion is assigned to each galaxy based on this luminosity
and empirical relations such as the morphology-density
relation and the fraction of morphological types observed
in clusters as a function of radius. Foreground galaxies
and stars are added to the imaging; however, there is
no additional mass along the line of sight to the cluster
associated with these interlopers.

To simulate the lensed background Universe, the lens-
ing signal from the cluster Ares is input into SkyLens
(Meneghetti et al. 2010, 2008), which ray traces real
galaxies from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (Beckwith
et al. 2006) to the image plane. SkyLens creates mock
HST imaging of the results, which match the depth and
wavelength coverage of the HFF observations.

The primary utility of Ares is for the ongoing HFF
lens modeling comparison study (Meneghetti et al. 2016).
The same teams that modeled the HFF clusters, using
diﬀerent methods, were invited to compute lens mod-
els for Ares. Each team was given the simulated imaging
along with a catalog of all the multiple image systems and
redshifts, but were initially blind to the true mass distri-
bution. The goal of this study is to identify how diﬀerent

methods reproduce the true mass and magniﬁcation of
an HFF-like cluster when given identical inputs and to
identify systematic errors across lens models that can be
addressed when creating the best lens models. The ini-
tial “blind” modeling took place in mid-2014, after which
the mass and magniﬁcation were unveiled to the model-
ing teams. Our goals in this work can be thought of the
tangent of those for the comparison study: rather than
determine the systematics for diﬀerent modeling meth-
ods using identical inputs, we are testing with a single
method how varying the quantity and redshift informa-
tion of constraints induces systematic errors.

4.2. The lens model
We follow a similar methodology for modeling Ares as
Johnson et al. (2014). We use the publicly available para-
metric modeling software Lenstool (Jullo et al. 2007),
which utilizes a Bayesian MCMC to explore the param-
eter space of the lensing distribution. We construct a
lens model using all of the available lensing evidence that
accurately reproduces the simulation mass and magniﬁ-
cation. We refer to this model as the ﬁducial model,
representing the best possible model we can create with
our methods when all of the information (images, red-
shifts, mass distribution, etc.) is revealed. The ﬁducial
model critical curves and images are shown in Figure 2.
The mass distribution is parameterized by pseudo-
isothermal elliptical mass distributions (PIEMD or dPIE;
Limousin et al. 2005); the proﬁle is described by a ﬁdu-
cial velocity dispersion σ0 to normalize the potential, an
ellipticity and position angle, and core radius rcore and
cut radius rcut, which control the inner and outer slopes
of the proﬁle, respectively. A summary of those halo
parameters is given in Table 1. We use two halos to rep-
resent the dark matter cores in the cluster, which were
also included in our “blind” lens model. We include the
masses of galaxy cluster members as small perturbers to
the smooth dark matter potential of the cluster. The
galaxies are selected by red-sequence membership and
their halo parameters are scaled by their brightness fol-

ter galaxies (including the two brightest galaxies in both
cores), we allow some of the parameters to deviate from
the scaling relations and to be guided by the lensing of
nearby multiple images, as we routinely do in lens models
of real clusters. Galaxy halo #1 (as indicated in Table 1)
is a massive galaxy that has a signiﬁcant impact on the
location of the critical curve in the southwestern portion
of the image plane. Galaxy halos #2 and #3 lie near the
centers of the two massive cluster halos and thus have an
impact on the locations of the radial arcs across the en-
tire cluster. The fourth galaxy halo is massive enough to
produce its own protrusion of the tangential critical curve

the lensing of several nearby images. These four galaxies
are needed for models with many constraints; however,
their parameters are more diﬃcult to constrain in the
case when there are no images within a few arcseconds
of the halo.

Our treatment of the scaling relations for Ares deviate
from those of the models in Johnson et al. (2014) due to
the construction of the simulation. We did not include

shape information from the light distribution to guide
the galaxy shapes in the lens model and instead modeled
the halos as single isothermal spheres (ellipticity = 0,
rcore = 0) in order to match closely to the parameteriza-
tion of the simulation. We ran a simple optimization to
explore which scaling parameters produce a close match
between the simulated halos and lens model halos. All
three of these parameters are highly degenerate when de-
termining the mass of a halo and thus no single param-

Coordinates are relative to the origin deﬁned in Figure 2.

eter combination was determined to be a signiﬁcantly
better ﬁt over the others. Additionally, the typical scale
of rcut is several tens to 100 kiloparsecs; at this scale the
halo of a galaxy begins to overlap with neighboring galax-
ies and the main cluster potential starts to dominate the
local surface mass density. Thus, rcut is diﬃcult to con-
strain. We selected a parameter combination that was
reasonable with those of previous strong lensing models
and matched well with the simulation: σ(cid:63)
0 = 100 km s−1,
rcut = 20 kpc, and m(cid:63)
F606W = 20.0. Due to a diﬀerent

choice of scaling relations and photometric band used for
scaling, we do not expect the simulation and lens model
to match perfectly. Our goal with this optimization is
to minimize the eﬀects of scaling parameter selection on
the overall systematic errors of the lens model we are
attempting to measure. The mass of the ﬁducial model
is reconstructed with an accuracy of −0.24+0.23
−0.30% of the
simulation mass within 500 kpc of the cluster center.

A list of simulated multiple images, their locations,
and their redshifts was released along with the simulated

data. We altered this list to comply more closely with one
that would have been created by a lens modeler identify-
ing images by eye. We made slight adjustments (< 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1)
to the location of the image constraints to match the
same features of a galaxy in all its multiple images. Ad-
ditionally, for three image systems with more extended
sources, we include multiple positional constraints corre-
sponding to diﬀerent unique features within the lensed
galaxy. Finally, we purged the list of images that would
not be detectable if the search was done by eye (for exam-
ple, images behind a large galaxy, too faint to be visible),
such that our identiﬁcation quality matched that of deep
HFF-based lens models. Figure 2 shows the locations
and redshifts of our ﬁnal list of 232 multiple images from
66 unique sources (Nﬁducial = 66) with 0.91 < z < 5.80
(and are listed in Table 2). The image plane rms for
the ﬁducial lens model of Ares for all 66 image systems
is 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)58 (see §6.1 for deﬁnition and further discussion),
which is on par with the scatter quoted for Lenstool-
based models of the HFF clusters (Jauzac et al. 2014,
2015a, 2016; Johnson et al. 2014; Richard et al. 2014;
Sharon & Johnson 2015; Treu et al. 2016).

5. TEST MODELS
The ﬁducial model of Ares represents an idealized sce-
nario for creating a lens model, one where many image
systems are known with certainty and all systems have
conﬁrmed redshifts. However, this scenario would be
considered extreme compared to models of real clusters,
which typically have fewer multiple image systems and
even fewer spectroscopic redshifts. To represent types
of cluster lens models that currently exist, we create
new models of Ares using “jacknifed” subsets of images
from the full list of image systems. We randomly select
n = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 image systems with their known
(spectroscopic) redshifts and m = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 im-
age systems with unknown redshifts and remodel the
cluster with a total number of image systems N =
n + m < Nﬁducial. For the m systems without known
redshifts, we only include image positions as constraints
in the model and leave redshift as a free parameter with
a uniform random prior probability distribution function
range of 0.6 < z < 7 (see § 8.2 for a treatment/discussion
of photometric redshifts). We run 10 diﬀerent models for
each combination of n, m for better statistics, each with
a unique set of images. We refer to these models with
diﬀerent n, m as the “test models” from here-on.

We choose to run the test models with the same pa-
rameterization as the ﬁducial model (i.e., same free and
ﬁxed parameters and priors as Table 1) so that we can
directly compare these models with the ﬁducial model.
It is true that models with lower N may not be able to
constrain all of the free parameters of the ﬁducial model.
By basing the parameterization of the test models oﬀ of
the ﬁducial model, we are including some knowledge a
priori about the mass distribution for which a given set
of N images alone may not be able to provide enough
evidence (i.e., existence of a secondary halo, shape of

central galaxies, etc.).
likely that a lens modeler would choose a diﬀerent pa-
rameterization; however, the choice of parameterization
on a model-by-model basis is not easy to simulate. With
this caveat in mind, the systematic errors for smaller N
stated here are likely lower limits that do not reﬂect the

choice in parameterization as a function of N .

Lens modeling is a computationally intensive task, as
proper modeling in the image plane entails inverting the
lens equation and computing the scatter for each multiple
image, which requires scanning many image plane pixels
for matching source plane positions. The newest versions
of Lenstool (v6.7 and above) have built-in parallelization
that dramatically reduces computation time; however,
a model can take days to weeks to run under optimal
parallelization. Since we ran all of the models for this
work with image plane optimization, the computation
time is considerable. We used the Flux High Performance
Cluster at the University of Michigan to compute these
models, using Lenstool version 6.8 on eight nodes with
20 core processors (two 10-core 2.8 GHz Intel Xeon E5-
2680v2 processors) and 96 GB RAM over the course of
four months, where all 350 test models ran continuously
in queue.
In order to increase the number of models
running in parallel on a single node, the models with
fewer total image systems N were assigned to run below
node capacity, such that the Ncores = ﬂoor(N/2) + 1 and
up to 20 cores. Each model was run with the Lenstool
parameter for Bayesian rate set to the maximum of 0.5
and for only a set of 5010 models in the MCMC. The
total wall time for the test models clocks in at ∼ 329, 000
core-hours.

6. RESULTS
The diﬀerent combinations of n (spectroscopic red-
shifts) and m (free parameter / unknown redshifts) result
in 35 model families. For better statistics, each of these
combinations was sampled 10 times, for a total of 350
models. We now compare the lensing outputs of these 35
model families against each other and against the ﬁdu-
cial lens model. Below, we investigate the dependence of
several diagnostics on the total number of lensed galaxies
used as constraints (N = n + m), the number of spec-
troscopic redshifts (n), and the fraction of spectroscopic
redshifts (n/N ).

quantity that is being minimized during image plane op-
timization (the χ2 is the image plane rms normalized by
the estimated error in image position). The locations of
multiple images are transformed to the source plane and
then relensed to other locations in the image plane and
the scatter is computed based on the separation of the
predicted and observed locations.

To see the eﬀects of adding image systems with spec-
troscopic or unknown redshifts, we compute the image
plane rms using all 66 image systems and their true red-
shifts for each of the test models in Figure 3 (top panels).
This test shows how well the model can reproduce lensing
in many parts of the image plane, not only where con-
straints are located. We ﬁnd that increasing the total
number of systems N decreases the rms scatter asymp-
totically toward the ﬁducial model rms. We also ﬁnd that
this trend is true for increasing number of spectroscopic
redshifts n and only weakly for increasing free parameter
redshifts m for models with n < 10. Models will improve

Johnson et al.

signiﬁcantly in image predicting power when more image
systems are included in the model, especially those with
spectroscopic redshifts. However, this eﬀect plateaus for
models with either N > 25 or n > 20, when the exact
selection of the constraints rather than quantity deter-
mines the level of systematic error in image plane rms.
In clusters with many lensed galaxies, modelers often rely
on preliminary lens models in order to predict the loca-
tions and identify new sets of lensed images. This result
shows the importance of having spectroscopic redshifts
in these preliminary models, as at least n > 10 spectro-
scopic redshifts are needed in order to robustly distin-
guish between multiple image candidates based on their
model-predicted location (rms < 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0). In particular, all
models with no spectroscopic redshifts have poor rms.

It is worth emphasizing that the image plane rms we
computed using all 66 image systems would not be the
value quoted for a typical lens model of a real cluster
in the literature. In reality, modelers compute the rms
only for the image systems used in the model and use the
redshift solutions from the best-ﬁt model for the systems
without spectroscopic redshifts (not the true redshifts,
as these are not known). To demonstrate this discrep-
ancy, we plot the rms value computed using only the
image systems and the model-derived redshifts1 in Fig-
ure 3 (bottom panels). We see that this value tends to
be much lower than the ﬁducial value, and the trends
for this rms are the reverse of the top panels. The rms
value computed in the bottom panels is a measure of
goodness of ﬁt, adding more free parameter redshifts in-
creases model ﬂexibility and adding more spectroscopic
systems increases the number of constraints without in-
creasing the number of free parameters. Models that are
less ﬂexible with more constraints produce higher rms
values in the bottom panels, indicating a worse model
ﬁt; however, these models are better at predicting the
locations of images across the entire image plane, as in-
dicated by the rms in the top panels.

Figure 3 demonstrates the need for caution when re-
lying on the image plane rms value to judge lens model
ﬁdelity, especially when many image systems with un-
known redshifts are included in the model. Since the de-
ﬂection ﬁeld scales with distance to the source, the image
plane rms will depend on the redshift of the source. For
spectroscopic systems, the redshift is ﬁxed; however, the
free parameter redshift of image systems included in the
model, by the construction of a maximum likelihood op-
timization, will take on a value for the redshift that helps
to minimize the overall image plane rms, which may or
may not coincide with the correct redshift. While mod-
els without free parameter redshifts have ﬂexibility and
report low image plane rms, they have the potential to
encounter parameter degeneracies between the mass dis-
tribution and source plane redshifts.

6.2. Model-predicted Redshifts
We investigate how accurately models using free pa-
rameter redshifts predict the true redshift of those im-
age systems. Figure 4 shows the error between model-
derived redshift and the true redshift of the system. We
plot these errors in terms of the lensing fraction Dls/Ds

1 This image plane rms corresponds to the value from the output

ﬁle in the Lenstool software for the best-ﬁt model.

rather than zs; as shown in Equation 3, the deﬂection
angle tensor αij scales linearly with the lensing fraction.
The typical error in model predicted Dls/Ds is < 2%
in all cases and tends to be lower for models that have
higher fractions of image systems with spectroscopic red-
shifts. Interestingly, models with low fractions of image
systems that have spectroscopic redshifts tend to predict
redshift solutions that are more often biased to higher
values for systems with z > 2. Nearly all of the model-
predicted Dls/Ds of models with n = 0 are biased high
by 5-10%.

6.3. Mass
In Figure 5, we plot the projected mass proﬁle of the
cluster for the ﬁducial model (top) and residual from the
ﬁducial model for all of the test models (bottom). We
ﬁnd that the errors in the enclosed mass are typically
< 4% out to 1 Mpc for models with n > 0. Models with
n = 0 are generally biased toward lower masses, which
is consistent with the model predicting higher redshifts
for the free parameter image systems. For models with
n > 0, the errors are generally lowest at radii around
the “arc radius,” rarcs = 305 kpc, deﬁned as the me-
dian image plane projected distance of images used as
constraints in the ﬁducial model; it is comparable to the
formal deﬁnition of the Einstein radius. Test model com-
binations with at least ﬁve spectroscopic redshifts have
errors of < 1% around the arc radius.

6.4. Magniﬁcation
The magniﬁcation describes the ampliﬁcation of the
solid angle of a lensed object from source plane to image
plane and is derived from the lensing Jacobian tensor

Aij ≡

∂βij
∂θij

= δij −

∂αi
∂θj

,

(5)

which describes the translation from source plane β to
image plane θ. The magniﬁcation µ is the inverse deter-
minant of this tensor,

µ =

1
| det Aij|

,

(6)

which becomes a nonlinear combination of ﬁrst-order
derivatives of α. Based on its complexity, we expect the
magniﬁcation factor to have more complicated relations
with observable quantities than the diagnostics discussed
earlier.

In Figure 6, we plot the error in magniﬁcation at each
image plane position corresponding to a source at z = 2
for each test model combination (i.e., median magniﬁ-
cation of each pixel across all models with same n, m)
relative to the ﬁducial model magniﬁcation. These maps
eﬀectively show the bias in magniﬁcation when selecting
n, m. We choose to display z = 2 because it corresponds
to a middle value of Dls/Ds for all the sources used as
constraints.

For models with n > 0, the magniﬁcation errors are
all quite similar. Across all models, the magniﬁcation is
most accurate in regions of lower magniﬁcation (µ < 10)
and along the straight portion of the critical curve, the
region where most of the multiple images are located.
A straight critical curve implies that the vector of the

number of spectroscopic redshifts and the number of free parameter redshifts used in the model, respectively (see legend at the top). The
top panels show the image plane rms values computed for all 66 image systems using the true redshift values. The bottom panels show the
image plane rms values computed only from the images used as constraints in the lens model and model-predicted redshifts. The dashed

deﬂection angle is nearly constant in terms of direction
and only changes in amplitude; solving the lens equation
in this region becomes one-dimensional. At the high-
curvature portions of the critical curve, the tangential
shear is strong and the deﬂection angle changes rapidly
in both amplitude and direction. Also, objects here are
highly magniﬁed, but their image multiplicity becomes
unity. These singly imaged sources are indeed strongly
lensed, but are not used as strong lensing constraints
for this modeling method. Some methods can use sin-
gle images as constraints; however, doing so greatly in-
creases computing time in order to reject models produc-
ing multiple images. Additionally, the ﬂexion of these
highly magniﬁed single-image systems could be included
in modeling methods to better constrain the mass dis-
tribution where there are no multiple images (see Cain
et al. 2011).

While Figure 6 shows the bias of the magniﬁcation for
all regions in the image plane over a slew of diﬀerent
models, Figure 7 shows the interquartile range (IQR2) in
magniﬁcation, i.e., how consistent the systematic errors
in magniﬁcation are relative to the ﬁducial models when
diﬀerent sets of constraints are used for the same n, m.
We plot the IQR to eliminate the eﬀects of potential
outlying models in our analysis. We see similar trends
to those of Figure 6: the IQR in magniﬁcation between
models is lower for regions with low magniﬁcation and
along the straight portion of the critical curve. We see
a very clear trend with reduced spread in magniﬁcation
error throughout most of the image plane with higher N .
We attempt to quantify the systematic errors in Fig-

2 We deﬁne the IQR as the diﬀerence between the 75th and
25th percentile models. These percentiles correspond to the aver-
age magniﬁcation between the 8th/9th-ranked and 2nd/3rd-ranked
models, respectively.

ure 8 by looking at the distribution of magniﬁcation er-
rors across the image plane. We create histograms of the
magniﬁcation error for each pixel for each individual test
model. We only examine pixels located in a rectangular
region with bounds selected arbitrarily such that it lies in
the lower right (+x, −y), aligned roughly with the critical
curve of the cluster, to avoid pixels near the curved por-
tion of the critical curve. This region of pixels is shown
in Figure 2. We also only select pixels with µﬁducial < 20
to avoid high magniﬁcations induced locally by cluster
member galaxies. We see that models with lower N tend
to produce magniﬁcations that are typically biased low;
however, beyond N ≥ 25, the distributions of models ap-
pear to be similar and with negligible bias, with a typical
error of about 2%.

It is noticeable across all test models that the variation
in the distribution of magniﬁcations is quite signiﬁcant
for the low total number of image systems, even amongst
test models with identical n, m. This indicates that it
is not necessarily the quantity of image systems or red-
shifts, but rather the selection of these constraints that
drives systematic error. We examined closely a few of the
models with outlying distributions in Figure 8 and found
that the random selection of spectroscopic redshift sys-
tems for those models was either unevenly distributed
spatially in the image plane or unevenly distributed in
redshift space.

In Figure 9, we plot the relative magniﬁcation error
and spread for all test models (deﬁned as they are in
Figure 8) versus the fraction of spectroscopic redshifts
n/N and total number of image systems N . We report
no clear trend in magniﬁcation error or spread with spec-
troscopic redshift fraction, except that models with no
spectroscopic redshift are biased toward lower magniﬁ-
cations and have a 1σ spread of about 3%. There is a

7. DISCUSSION
7.1. Number of image systems in a model
The selection of image systems with or without con-
ﬁrmed redshifts is usually not a choice in building a lens
model because, for most clusters, the number of con-
straints is small regardless and thus modelers require a
minimum number of constraints to build a statistically
meaningful model. However, the paradigm has changed
with the onset of the HFF, where there is a seemingly
inﬁnite number of multiple image systems and several
spectroscopic redshifts from which to build our models.
Statistical errors in these scenarios are now much lower
than the systematics, so including or rejecting a candi-
date image systems in a model is now a question of its in-

ﬂuence on systematic error. Our results show that mod-
els reach a threshold in systematic errors across all diag-
nostics once N ≥ 25 and n > 0 have been established.
For the test models, the identiﬁcation of images and red-
shift measurements are known with certainty; however,
that is not the case in real scenarios. Beyond this thresh-
old, rejecting an incorrect image system or redshift based
on a high degree of uncertainty will likely deﬂate rather
than inﬂate systematic errors.

7.2. Finding new multiple image systems
From Figure 3, we learned that spectroscopic redshift
systems are needed to improve the image plane rms of
a model when few constraints are available (N < 15).
While this may have its applications for post-modeling,
image predictability is most applicable for improving an
existing model by using its deﬂection to ﬁnd new multi-
ple image systems. The results of this work emphasize
the importance of including more spectroscopic redshifts

early on in the stages of lens modeling because models
built using fewer spectroscopic redshifts have more error
in predictability and thus are more likely to ﬁnd false
image systems. While the brightest and largest multi-
ple image systems are obvious by morphology and color
without conﬁrmed redshifts, fainter and smaller systems
are more ambiguous, especially where many faint galax-
ies at all redshifts pass the detection limit and could be
confused for lensed galaxy candidates.

7.3. Constraining mass
Mass proﬁles of galaxy clusters are quite robust to red-
shift conﬁrmation of multiple image systems. Figure 5
shows that including more image systems in a model with
at least a handful of spectroscopic redshifts helps to re-

duce systematic errors in mass proﬁle. The systematic
error on total projected mass out to 1 Mpc is only 2% for
models with N ≥ 25 and n > 0 (4% for N < 25). This
result is promising for using strong lensing clusters for
cosmology – future large area surveys will ﬁnd hundreds
of clusters and complete spectroscopic follow-up will not
be a feasible task. Knowing that mass within the Ein-
stein radius has low systematic errors will add further
signiﬁcance to cosmological models constrained by strong
lensing masses. However, these low errors lie on top of
statistical errors and systematics due to structure along
the line of sight. We note that we only investigated the
mass proﬁle of a single, massive cluster in this work. It
would be important in future work to test if this result
holds for less massive clusters that lens only a handful of

images.

7.4. Improving magniﬁcation estimates
We ﬁnd that the regions of the lens map with the high-
est systematic error are those close to the critical curve
and/or along portions with signiﬁcant curvature where
the shear is high and there are few multiple images. The
lowest error regions are those covered by multiple images,
along portions of the critical curve that are straight. We
found that models with low N and low n tend to estimate
lower magniﬁcations overall. As we saw, the free param-
eter redshifts solved for in models with many free param-
eter redshifts tend to be biased high, which results in a
lower mass and thus lower magniﬁcation, which matches
the trends we see in Figures 4-8. While mostly qualita-
tive, this information is useful for anyone questioning the
accuracy of a magniﬁcation value. While it is trivial to
estimate the magniﬁcation and statistical uncertainties

for a single image plane position by blindly computing it
for one pixel in a magniﬁcation map, one needs to con-
sider the pixel position within the full image plane to
begin estimating the systematics.

7.5. Models without spectroscopic redshifts
Since the deﬂection angle depends on source redshift,
the mass estimate within the Einstein radius depends on
the redshift of the multiple images.
If the redshift of
the source is unknown, then the mass is degenerate with
redshift. Therefore, lens models need at least one spec-
troscopic redshift to break the degeneracy. We test this
theory by running models without spectroscopic redshifts
and ﬁnd that it is indeed the case that models built with
even a handful of spectroscopic redshifts outperform all
models built without any spectroscopic redshifts across

age system, and therefore under-predict the mass by up
to 10% at the Einstein radius, and produce magniﬁca-
tions that can be either highly under- or over-predicted
depending on the selection of constraints. When also
factoring in statistical errors, which are high for low N
systems, and other systematics like structure along the
line of sight, any lensing outputs from models with no
spectroscopic redshifts should be treated with caution.

7.6. Increasing the number of spectroscopic redshifts in

a single model

Our results in §6.4 showed that there was no trend in
systematic errors on magniﬁcation with the fraction of
spectroscopic redshifts used in a model when considering
random selections of n, m. However, in cluster lensing
scenarios similar to the HFF, the selection of image sys-
tems mostly stays the same and the fraction of spectro-
scopic redshifts n/N increases over time as more spectro-
scopic data are collected. Ongoing lensing analyses of the
HFF have so far indicated that increasing the fraction of
spectroscopic redshifts for a given cluster may decrease
systematic errors on its lens models. The tensions be-
tween observations of Supernova Tomas in Abell 2744
and Supernova Refsdal in MACS J1149.6+2223 and the

predictions from several diﬀerent lens models (i.e., mag-
niﬁcation, time delays) have weak negative correlations
with the fraction of spectroscopic redshifts (Rodney et al.
2015, 2016). In this scenario, the lens models are built
by diﬀerent teams using nearly the exact same identi-
ﬁcations of multiple image systems, with some models
including new spectroscopic systems in addition to exist-
ing sets.

To test whether we see this trend in the simulations,
we design a set of lens models that represent a progres-
sion in increasing spectroscopic redshift fraction. We
construct six new lens models of Ares, each using the
same set of 25 image systems. The ﬁrst model is con-
structed without any spectroscopic redshifts, the second
adds spectroscopic redshifts to 5 of these systems, the
third adds an additional ﬁve spectroscopic redshifts to
the existing 5 (10 total), etc., until all image systems
have spectroscopic redshifts. The 25 systems and each
additional spectroscopic system are selected carefully in
order to maintain a roughly uniform distribution of lo-
cations in the image plane and of redshift. Figure 10
shows the magniﬁcation error of these models with re-
spect to the model with n = N , in the same manner
as Figure 9. Here, it is clear that the accuracy of the

the MCMCs. The top row shows the image plane positions of the images from the 25 systems used as constraints. The blue and red
points represent systems with and without spectroscopic redshifts, respectively. Each map is 200(cid:48)(cid:48)×200(cid:48)(cid:48) centered on the origin deﬁned in
Figure 2. The green solid and dashed lines indicate the locations of the z = 2 critical curve and the region of multiple images, respectively.
The colored circles represent models using the same constraints as the models shown in the maps above; however, photometric redshift
measurements are used as the priors for the free parameter redshifts rather than a uniform random prior. The colors indicate the rms error
in the photometric redshifts used for that particular model: (zspec − zphot)/(1 + zspec) (see § 8.2).

magniﬁcation estimates improves with increasing n/N ,
indicating that measuring the spectroscopic redshifts of
known lensed galaxies that are used as constraints will
help decrease systematic errors while the precision is set
based on the total number of systems. This result is
consistent with those of Rodney et al. (2015, 2016), but
shows a much stronger correlation. It is likely that the
trends in the HFF models are weakened by systematics in
the modeling methods themselves and that the selection
of constraints were not exactly identical between models.
It is still important to note, however, that the model
with n = N is oﬀset in magniﬁcation error from the ﬁdu-
cial model by about -0.01 mag. This result is expected,
as we saw in Figure 8 that models with n = 25, m = 0
have a systematic error of 0.02 mag with respect to the
ﬁducial. With this in mind, increasing n/N for a single
model is most eﬀective at decreasing systematic errors
in magniﬁcation up to about n/N ∼ 0.5. Beyond that,
the exact selection of all the image systems used in the
model is a more signiﬁcant source of systematic error.

While an investigation of the eﬀect of photometric red-
shift information is beyond the scope of this paper, we
do include a test case where we constrain the free red-
shift parameters with priors from photometric redshift

catalogs. This preliminary analysis indicates that pho-
tometric redshifts may increase the accuracy of the lens
model, but can also result in signiﬁcantly inaccurate re-
sults if not handled with care. We discuss this in § 8.2
below.

8. FUTURE WORK
While we have begun to thoroughly investigate the
systematics of lens modeling in this paper, there are
still many contributing factors we have not yet explored.
Here, we considered how using diﬀerent random subsets
of spectroscopic and free parameter redshift image sys-
tems in a strong lens model aﬀects the resulting multiple
image predictability, mass proﬁles, and magniﬁcations.
As stated above, these results suggest that the exact se-
lection of constraints and redshift information may be
more inﬂuential on systematic errors than quantity, es-
pecially for the values of the magniﬁcation. Thus, we
plan to follow-up investigations of constraint selection in
our continuation of this work.

8.1. Observational limits on constraint selection

random by any means and is a function of image bright-

ness, which depends on the source’s intrinsic brightness,
luminosity distance from observer, and magniﬁcation in-
duced by the galaxy cluster. The faintest observed im-
ages are less likely to be identiﬁed as multiple images.
Similarly, obtaining spectroscopic redshifts can depend
on image brightness, redshift, and image plane position.
Multi-object spectrographs are limited in slit-packing ca-
pabilities and may only target the brightest systems for
redshift measurements. Spectra of images close to cluster
member galaxies might be contaminated, for which may
make determining a redshift more diﬃcult. HST grism
spectroscopy and integral ﬁeld spectrographs are able to
target many more images; however, they tend to have
a limited total ﬁeld of view. Additionally, completeness
of spectroscopic redshifts depends on redshift as bright
emission lines get shifted out of the instrument’s wave-
length coverage for certain redshifts, the so-called “red-
shift desert” where redshifts become more challenging to
measure. Factoring these selection eﬀects could highlight
position and redshift dependencies on the systematic er-
ror induced by spectroscopic selection eﬀects.

8.2. Photometric redshifts
The current analysis clearly leaves out possible useful
information in the form of photometric redshifts; these
are typically available for clusters with extensive mul-
tiwavelength imaging data. Photometric redshift mea-
surements are prone to their own systematic errors, and
while these measurements can become more precise with
increased number of bandpasses and deeper data, catas-
trophic failures can still occur. Photometric redshift
measurements can be implemented in the lens modeling
process by using the posterior probability distribution
for the photometric redshift as the prior for the free pa-
rameter redshift in the lens modeling. While we leave a
thorough investigation of the aﬀect of photometric red-
shifts on lensing systematics for future work, we present
here a case study.

We re-run the models we used in § 7.6 with n = 0 and
n = 10 three more times using diﬀerent realistic photo-
metric redshift estimates for the priors of images without
spectroscopic redshifts.
In this experiment, the lensed
galaxies used as constraints with spectroscopic redshifts
are treated the same as before. However, lensed galaxies
without spectroscopic redshifts are not assigned a uni-
form random prior on their free parameter redshift, but
rather a gaussian prior centered on an assumed photo-
metric redshift. We use the ASTRODEEP photometric
redshift catalogs for HFF clusters Abell 2744 and MACS
J0416 (Castellano et al. 2016) to determine our realis-
tic photometric redshift measurements, and supplement
the spectroscopic redshift sample of MACS 0416 with
the MUSE redshifts measured by Caminha et al. (2016).
We use the spectroscopic and photometric catalogs from
this sample to estimate the accuracy of a photometric
redshift given its true redshift. For each galaxy in our
models of Ares, where we do not include the spectro-
scopic redshift as a constraint, we draw a galaxy from
the ASTRODEEP catalog with a similar spectroscopic
redshift to its true redshift in the Ares simulation (within
0.04(1 + ztrue)). We then assign the photometric redshift
estimate obtained for that ASTRODEEP galaxy as the
center of gaussian prior for the Ares galaxy. We assign
a typical statistical error on photometric redshifts from

the ASTRODEEP catalog as the width of the gaussian
prior (these errors can vary signiﬁcantly from galaxy to
galaxy and across redshifts, from a few percent to up to
50%.) This procedure results in a realistic representa-
tion of scatter of photometric redshift values at a ﬁxed
spectroscopic redshift, as well as the rate of catastrophic
failures in ﬁelds that are by construction similar to our
simulation. We include these models in Figure 10 as col-
ored circles, where the color matches the rms error in
photometric redshift. The results show that photometric
redshifts can improve the lens modeling process, how-
ever, only when the photometric redshifts are relatively
accurate. As shown in Figure 10, using only photometric
redshift priors can actually increase systematic errors in
magniﬁcation over the use of broad uniform random pri-
ors when there are catastrophic failures in the photomet-
ric redshift measurements. One of the models we used
had no spectroscopic redshifts and a photometric redshift
rms error of 0.18, including a catastrophic failure with
zphot = 1.06 for zspec = 5.34. This model produced a
worse systematic oﬀset in magniﬁcations compared to the
ﬁducial model. After adding 10 spectroscopic redshifts,
the rms error dropped to 0.06, which is likely the result
of replacing a catastrophic failure photometric redshift
measurement with the true redshift of that system. The
resulting model performs slightly better than the model
without any photometric redshift information. The two
other models with no spectroscopic redshifts had a mod-
erate rms error (0.12) and reduced the systematic error
by 0.01-0.02 dex, but did not perform signiﬁcantly bet-
ter after adding more spectroscopic redshifts. Photomet-
ric redshifts have the highest impact on modeling when
there are few to no spectroscopic redshifts; however, this
only improves the model if those photometric redshifts
are reasonably accurate.

It is worth noting that there are a few aspects of in-
cluding photometric redshifts in lens modeling that are
diﬃcult to simulate because they are highly dependent
on the experience of the lens modeler. In the case of the
catastrophic failure like in one of the models we tested,
it is quite likely that a lens modeler would have rejected
any low-redshift solutions that are inconsistent with the
lensing geometry based on a model produced by the other
images with reasonable photometric redshifts (the z = 5
critical curve has a much larger extent than the z = 1
critical curve, so the multiple images should be closer
together). We also are not considering that the individ-
ual images may have diﬀerent photometric redshift esti-
mates. Brighter images may have more robust redshifts
while fainter or contaminated images may produce wildly
diﬀerent photometric redshifts. A system of images with
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent photometric redshifts may be less
likely to be identiﬁed as a system and therefore not used
in the lens model. It is unclear at this point how much
more photometric redshifts will improve lens modeling if
they are not reasonably accurate. However, future purely
photometric surveys will have few if no spectroscopic
redshifts for the many thousands of lensing clusters pre-
dicted to be found. Thus, it is important to investigate
how photometric redshifts impact lens modeling and we
plan to do so more extensively in future work.

8.3. Image multiplicity and misidentiﬁed multiple

images

Our analysis in this paper investigated how the number
of multiple image systems aﬀects the systematic errors in
lens modeling. However, we assume that every image sys-
tem is equal in constraining power and that each system
has been correctly identiﬁed. In reality, image systems
with higher multiplicity (e.g., 4-image systems versus 2-
image systems) have a higher weight in the lens model-
ing. Additionally, higher multiplicity image systems are
likely to include radial arcs that will have higher con-
straining power on the inner slope of the mass proﬁle.
From the suite of 350 models we ran, the average image
multiplicity (i.e., average number of images per system)
ranged from 2.8 to 3.8 for all combinations of n, m. We
found no trend in systematic errors in the inner and outer
slopes of the mass proﬁle nor the magniﬁcations with av-
erage image multiplicity. It is possible that trends could
occur when the number of image systems is fewer than
ﬁve, which was the lowest number of systems we inves-
tigated. Thus, image multiplicity should be investigated
in future work with clusters that have very few multiple
image systems to constrain lens models.

We did not account for image identiﬁcation error in our
analysis. The faintest images of a single system are the
most likely to be misidentifed because they can be easily
confused with other background sources or blended with
foreground objects. As stated in § 4.2, we did not include
some of these images that are likely to be misidentiﬁed
in our models. Therefore, our results show the best-
case scenario when lens modelers use only the highest
conﬁdence images in their lens models. Simulating the
eﬀects of misidentiﬁcation could be done in future work
by comparing models where the faintest image system is
perturbed by several arcseconds or not included in the
model.

8.4. Image plane and redshift distribution of lensing

constraints

For models with smaller numbers of image systems, it
is important to assess how the spatial distribution of im-
age systems in the image plane aﬀects systematic errors.
We found in this work that many of the outlier test mod-
els in mass and magniﬁcation had uneven spatial distri-
bution of spectroscopic systems. We also saw that mod-
els with smaller N had larger spread in mass and magniﬁ-
cation because the spatial distribution of the constraints
can vary signiﬁcantly from model to model. As more con-
straints are added, constraints will more evenly populate
the multiple image region. Ares simulates a very massive
cluster and it is likely that a cluster of this size will lens
more than a handful of image systems. Therefore, we
did not attempt to model Ares using fewer than ﬁve im-
age systems. We would consider instead modeling a less
massive cluster to assess how image plane distribution
aﬀects the outcome of a lens model.

As we found in this analysis, the elongated mass distri-
bution of Ares across the sky creates an elliptical critical
curve, where the magniﬁcation errors are lowest along
the straight portions of the critical curve. These elon-
gated mass distributions are common amongst the HFF
clusters, which lie at the cusp of mass assembly in the

investigate systematics on clusters with more spherical
mass distributions. A prime example would be Abell
1689, which has a large number of identiﬁed image sys-
tems with spectroscopic redshifts and for which existing
lens models suggest it has a more circular critical curve
(Broadhurst et al. 2005; Limousin et al. 2007; Coe et al.
2010; Diego et al. 2015).

The redshift distribution of lensed sources could po-
tentially increase systematic error as well. The sources
used in Ares were well distributed across redshifts from
z ∼ 0.9 − 6; however, this is not the case in reality be-
cause the luminosity function of galaxies and the area
of the caustic region both depend on redshift. There
is an observational bias toward selecting the brightest
sources, and as lensing conserves surface brightness, this
leads to a higher likelihood of low-redshift sources being
identiﬁed and used as constraints in a model. We found
that some models that were outliers in our analysis for
a given n, m had uneven distributions in redshifts. It is
well known that multiple redshifts of sources are needed
to establish the slope of the mass distribution in a lens
model (i.e., break the mass-sheet degeneracy, see Schnei-
der & Seitz 1995). In cases where all the lensed sources
are low redshift, it is possible to extrapolate the mass to
larger Einstein radii and thus predict the magniﬁcation
of higher redshift sources; however, the accuracy of doing
so is unknown and is worth investigating in the future.

For clusters such as Ares, built to resemble massive
lensing clusters such as the HFF, it is safe to say that
there will be a wealth of constraints across the image
plane and redshift space. More massive clusters have
a larger lensing cross-section and thus have access to a
much larger volume of background sources from which
to lens. The investigations into image plane and redshift
distribution of lensing constraints is best left to more
average mass clusters, which will likely only lens a hand-
ful of sources. As Ares is too massive to investigate the
parameter space of N < 5, these questions call for a dif-
ferent design in cluster lensing simulations and are best
left for future studies.

9. CONCLUSION
We have investigated the systematic errors of para-
metric strong lensing modeling induced by the selection
of constraints using our “unblinded” model of the sim-
ulated cluster Ares (Meneghetti et al. 2016). Here we
summarize our ﬁndings.

1. The image plane rms based on the full lensing ev-
idence, i.e., the image predictive power of a lens
model, improves mostly eﬀectively with increasing
number of spectroscopic redshift image systems.
This result indicates the necessity for obtaining
spectroscopic redshifts early on in the modeling
process because they are crucial to increasing the
accuracy of ﬁnding new multiple image systems.
We also have shown, however, that the image plane
rms values quoted in the literature, which are com-
puted only from image systems used in the model
using best-ﬁt model redshifts, shows the opposite
trend. While lower values of the rms computed this
way reveal a better model ﬁt with more free param-
eters and fewer constraints, it can be misleading as
a measure of model accuracy.

2. Lens models with at least a handful of spectro-
scopic redshifts are able to predict the redshifts
of image systems without spectroscopic redshifts
within 2% (in Dls/Ds); however, they are gener-
ally biased higher for image systems with z > 2.

3. The mass proﬁles are accurately measured for all
variations of lens model constraints with n > 0:
< 4% error within 1 Mpc and < 2% at the cluster
Einstein radius.

4. Qualitatively, the magniﬁcation error is lowest in
regions of the image plane where the multiple im-
ages are located and typically along the straight
portions of the critical curve. The magniﬁcation
error is larger at the curved portions of the critical
curve and typically biased toward lower values.

5. The accuracy of magniﬁcations increases with total
number of image systems, and for N > 20 plateaus
to 2%. We observe no trend in magniﬁcation accu-
racy with a fraction of spectroscopic redshift when
comparing models in which n, m are chosen ran-
domly, as long as this fraction is greater than zero.
However, we do ﬁnd that for a model with a ﬁxed
set of multiple images, increasing the fraction of
systems with spectroscopic redshifts helps improve
the accuracy while maintaining a nearly a constant
level of precision.

6. Lens models need at least a few spectroscopic sys-
tems in order to produce reasonable estimates of
the mass and magniﬁcation. Models computed
without spectroscopic redshifts are biased toward
lower masses (5 − 10%) and lower magniﬁcations
(> 2%). The systematic error will be lower for
models that use more image systems; however,
models built using many image systems without
spectroscopic redshifts still produce higher errors
than models with only a handful of spectroscopic
redshifts.

7. Photometric redshifts can be implemented in lens
modeling to improve upon the systematic errors on
magniﬁcation, especially when there are no spec-
troscopic data available for the constraints. How-
ever, inaccurate photometric redshifts (i.e., catas-
trophic failures) can actually inﬂate the systematic
errors of a lens model.

Based on our ﬁndings, we put forth the following rec-

ommendations with regards to strong lens modeling.

1. After obtaining new spectroscopic redshifts, newer
iterations on existing lens models should be recon-
structed using only spectroscopic systems ﬁrst be-
fore including systems with no spectroscopic red-
shifts as constraints. This method will likely lead
to a higher success rate of ﬁnding correct multiple
image systems.

2. Models with many unknown redshifts report the
image plane rms computed for only systems with
spectroscopic redshifts as a means to measure
model prediction locations of images versus the
truth.

3. In circumstances where there are ample numbers of
image systems (N > 25) it may be advantageous to
include only the highest conﬁdence image systems
(those that are spectroscopically conﬁrmed and/or
wholly unambiguous by color and morphology), as
removing less conﬁdent images may decrease sys-
tematics more than the cost of increasing statistical
errors.

4. Simply selecting a value from a best-ﬁt model and
quoting only statistical errors is not enough for
properly estimating magniﬁcations of background
sources, one needs to assess the location of that ob-
ject within the image plane (assuming the source
redshift is known) as well and determine whether
or not a pure strong lensing analysis is enough to
estimate the magniﬁcation.

While we have discussed the impact of constraint se-
lection on systematic errors, there are many sources
i.e.,
of error we leave to discuss in future papers,
image plane distribution of constraints, redshift, and
brightness-dependent selections, photometric redshifts
as constraints, unmodeled line-of-sight substructure
(e.g., D’Aloisio et al. 2014), cluster substructure (e.g.,
Limousin et al. 2007), cosmological parameter uncer-
tainty (e.g., Bayliss et al. 2015), and choice of lensing
algorithm (Meneghetti et al. 2016), which we have not
quantiﬁed here. Additionally, we would like to extend
these studies to real clusters in the ﬁeld and to less mas-
sive clusters that represent a larger fraction of the cluster
population.

This work is timely as projects such as the lens mod-
els for the HFF are continuously being upgraded with
several spectroscopic campaigns of multiple image sys-
tems underway (ex., Karman et al. 2015; Grillo et al.
2016; Jauzac et al. 2016; Treu et al. 2016). New and ex-
citing highly magniﬁed cluster-lensed galaxies are being
discovered frequently and the demand for precise and ac-
curate lens models has never been higher to understand
the lensed background Universe. We hope these results
and those to come will help guide and motivate lens mod-
elers and observers alike in meeting those demands and
utilize the full power of cosmic telescopes.

ful comments and feedback. Many thanks to Massimo
