ABSTRACT

High-resolution spectroscopy of the core of the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, using the
Hitomi satellite above 2 keV and the XMM-Newton Reﬂection Grating Spectrometer at lower
energies, provides reliable constraints on the abundances of O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr,
Mn, Fe, and Ni. Accounting for all known systematic uncertainties, the Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, and
Ni/Fe ratios are determined with a remarkable precision of less than 10%, while the con-
straints on Si/Fe, S/Fe, and Cr/Fe are at the 15% level, and Mn/Fe is measured with a 20%
uncertainty. The average biases in determining the chemical composition using archival CCD
spectra from XMM-Newton and Suzaku range typically from 15–40%. A simple model in
which the enrichment pattern in the Perseus Cluster core and the proto-solar nebula are iden-
tical gives a surprisingly good description of the high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy results,
with χ2 = 10.7 for 10 d.o.f. However, this pattern is challenging to reproduce with linear
combinations of existing supernova nucleosynthesis calculations, particularly given the pre-
cise measurements of intermediate α-elements enabled by Hitomi. We discuss in detail the
degeneracies between various supernova progenitor models and explosion mechanisms, and
the remaining uncertainties in these theoretical models. We suggest that including neutrino
physics in the core-collapse supernova yield calculations may improve the agreement with
the observed pattern of α-elements in the Perseus Cluster core. Our results provide a comple-
mentary benchmark for testing future nucleosynthesis calculations required to understand the
origin of chemical elements.

INTRODUCTION

Shortly after the Big Bang, all ordinary matter in the Universe was
in the form of hydrogen and helium gas, with only trace amounts of
other light elements like Li and Be. The chemical elements required
for the existence of life were later forged in stars and dispersed into
the interstellar medium by supernova explosions (Burbidge et al.
1957). Only a small fraction of the original gas reservoir has un-
dergone this process: 70 – 90 % of the baryonic mass content in
clusters of galaxies are in the form of hot (107 − 108 K), diﬀuse
X-ray emitting gas (Ettori & Fabian 1999) that ﬁlls the space be-
tween galaxies (so-called intra-cluster medium, or ICM). Never-
theless, metals produced in cluster member galaxies have been ex-
pelled into the ICM, such that a dominant fraction of the chemical
elements in the local Universe is now found in this X-ray emitting
plasma.

Remarkably, the spectral band of modern X-ray telescopes
covers emission lines from all the abundant chemical elements
(from C up to Ni; in astronomy, these are all collectively referred to
as “metals”). Moreover, interpreting spectra of the ICM is relatively
uncomplicated, because the plasma is (with very few exceptions)
optically thin and in collisional ionisation equilibrium. This makes
X-ray spectroscopy an ideal tool to probe the chemical evolution
history of the Universe.

The ICM in clusters of galaxies serves as the repository for
ejecta from billions of type Ia and core-collapse supernova explo-
sions (SNIa and SNcc, respectively), with very diﬀerent abundance
ratio patterns. Broadly speaking, the lighter metals, from O to Mg,
are mainly produced in massive stars and ejected in SNcc at the
end of their life time, while heavier elements from Cr to Ni are
mainly produced by SNIa (see, e.g. Tsujimoto et al. 1995). Both
supernova types contribute signiﬁcant amounts of intermediate el-
ements from Si to Ca. The fraction of SNIa to SNcc enriching the
ICM is therefore one of the main factors that aﬀects the observed
metal abundance patterns. The initial metallicity of the progenitors,
the initial mass function (IMF) of the stars that explode as SNcc,
and details about the exact SNIa explosion mechanism, also inﬂu-
ence the observed ratios between various elements (see reviews by
Werner et al. 2008 and Mernier et al. 2018).

Abundance measurements from ASCA, and later XMM-
Newton and Suzaku observations, have been used by several groups
to calculate the contribution of diﬀerent kinds of supernovae to the
ICM enrichment and to put constraints on the theoretical super-
nova models and properties of the stellar population responsible
for the chemical enrichment of the Universe on the largest scales
(e.g. Mushotzky et al. 1996; de Plaa et al. 2007; Sato et al. 2007).
In what is arguably the most comprehensive study on this topic to
date, Mernier et al. (2016a) used a large sample of XMM-Newton
observations to constrain the average abundances of 11 diﬀerent
metals (O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) in the cen-
tral ICM of 44 clusters of galaxies. Based on those measurements,
Mernier et al. (2016b) discuss the results and limitations of try-
ing to ﬁt the measured chemical enrichment pattern with various
combinations of nucleosynthesis models from the literature. This
study estimates that the fraction of SNIa over the total number of
SNe (SNIa+SNcc) contributing to the ICM enrichment ranges be-
tween 29–45%, in good agreement with previous estimates (e.g.
Simionescu et al. 2009; Bulbul et al. 2012). However, Mernier et al.
(2016b) also show that combinations of any commonly employed
SNIa and SNcc yields fail to reproduce the abundance pattern in
detail, with the observed Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios in particular being
signiﬁcantly underestimated by the models.

Some of this tension has been alleviated by the recent high-
spectral resolution observations of the Perseus Cluster performed
with the Soft X-ray-Spectrometer (SXS) onboard the Hitomi satel-
lite (Takahashi et al. 2016). The superb energy resolution of the
SXS of only 5 eV allows us to separate emission lines from Ni
and Fe, which appear blended in spectra measured with conven-
tional CCDs, and to test underlying atomic models. The resulting
best-ﬁt Ni/Fe ratio is much lower than initially reported in Mernier
et al. (2016a). In addition, weak lines from Cr and Mn are seen
with a much better contrast against the continuum emission. Hitomi
Collaboration (2017) (hereafter ZNpaper) focusses on the Cr/Fe,
Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios measured accurately for the ﬁrst time with
the SXS using an integrated spectrum from the entire ﬁeld of view
of the Hitomi observation, and discusses their implications for con-
straining the SN Ia progenitors.

On the other hand, the α-element to Fe ratios, together with
the absolute Fe/H, are also a powerful diagnostic both of supernova
nucleosynthesis details and of the stellar evolution in the cluster
member galaxies responsible for polluting the ICM with metals.
Early X-ray data had suggested that the α-element to Fe abundance
pattern was diﬀerent from Solar (Mushotzky et al. 1996), varied
from system to system (e.g. Fukazawa et al. 2000), or changed as a
function of distance from the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) (e.g.
Finoguenov et al. 2000; Rasmussen & Ponman 2009). Given that
very massive elliptical galaxies are known to have high α-element
to Fe ratios (Conroy et al. 2014), while on the other hand the rate
of SN Ia per unit star formation may be higher in cluster galaxies
than in the ﬁeld (Maoz & Graur 2017), these diﬀerences in chem-
ical composition between the ICM and the Milky Way were not
surprising, and promised to yield important clues towards under-
standing how star formation proceeds diﬀerently as a function of
environment.

However, with improvements in the photon statistics, instru-
ment calibration, and spectral modelling, more recent X-ray mea-
surements are converging on a scenario wherein the abundance ra-
tios in the ICM are in fact consistent with the Solar pattern. For
the nearby, X-ray bright Perseus Cluster, near-Solar relative abun-
dances with respect to Fe were found both in the core (Tamura et al.
2009) and on ∼ Mpc scales (Matsushita et al. 2013); in-depth stud-
ies of other individual clusters show that the α-element to Fe ratios
in the ICM appear to be consistent with Solar over an order of mag-
nitude in absolute metallicity, from the most metal-enriched clus-
ter core (the Centaurus Cluster with a central Z=2 Solar, Sanders
& Fabian 2006; Matsushita et al. 2007) all the way to the largest
cluster-centric distances probed to date (0.2 Solar near the virial
radius of the Virgo Cluster, Simionescu et al. 2015). Mernier et al.
(2017) ﬁnd that the relative abundances of all elements detected
by XMM-Newton with respect to Fe remain constant over a large
sample of cluster cores, despite a radial gradient in [Fe/H].

These two emerging paradigms – namely, a chemical compo-
sition of the ICM that is (i) close to Solar and (ii) spatially invariant
– need to be conﬁrmed (or ruled out) by using the full capabilities
of the best high-resolution spectroscopy observations that are ac-
cessible to date. In this paper, we expand upon the initial results
of Hitomi to present the most detailed view so far of the chemi-
cal abundance pattern in the Perseus Cluster core. In particular, we
derive constraints on the spatial variation of the measured metal
abundance ratios as a function of radius, within the limits allowed
by Hitomi’s point spread function and ﬁeld of view (Section 3.1);
we show the results of searching for weak line emission from other
elements such as Al, Cl, K, and Ti in the micro-calorimeter data
(Section 3.2); we discuss the implications of a Solar abundance pat-

tern in the Perseus Cluster core (Section 4.1); and we combine SXS
and XMM-Newton Reﬂection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) data to
provide updated constraints on the supernova yields using the high-
est available spectral resolution for all elements from O through Ni
that are detected in the X-ray band (Section 4.2), focusing in par-
ticular on the lighter α-elements not previously discussed in the
ZNpaper. In addition, the wealth of the Perseus observational data
obtained with both CCD and high-resolution spectroscopy instru-
ments provides an unique opportunity to accurately quantify the
systematic biases in a consistent way. Therefore, we compare the
results derived from high-resolution versus CCD spectroscopy in
order to estimate the reliability of previous estimates of the chemi-
cal composition of the ICM (Section 4.3).

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

We combine information from the recent Hitomi SXS observations,
together with a reanalysis of archival data from XMM-Newton and
Suzaku, to provide the most detailed picture of the chemical com-
position of a galaxy cluster core available to date. The observations
used in this work are listed in Table 1, and the data analysis meth-
ods for each instrument are described below. Due to diﬀerent sen-
sitivities, bandpasses, and spatial responses, diﬀerent instruments
will sample slightly diﬀerent parts of the central ICM with diﬀer-
ent weightings, even when identical spatial extraction regions are
considered. Therefore, in our analysis, the best-ﬁt spectral model
parameters are calculated separately for each of the various de-
tectors considered here. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, statis-
tical errors are quoted at the 68% conﬁdence level throughout the
manuscript, and abundances are expressed in units of the proto-
solar values reported by Lodders et al. (2009).

2.1 Hitomi Soft X-ray Spectrometer

The data reduction procedure used in this work is identical to that
presented in Hitomi Collaboration 2018c (hereafter Tpaper). In
summary, we use the cleaned event data in the third pipeline prod-
ucts, with the standard screening for the post-pipeline data reduc-
tion (Angelini et al. 2016). The spectral analysis was performed
using only GRADE Hp (high-resolution primary) events that have
the best energy resolution. The redistribution matrix (RMF) was
generated with the XL (extra-large) size option, which accounts for
the full components of the spectral response, including the main
peak, low-energy exponential tail, escape peaks, and electron-loss
continuum. The ancillary response ﬁle (ARF) was generated as-
suming a diﬀuse source with a radius of 12(cid:48) and with the surface
brightness distribution constrained by a Chandra image extracted
in the 1.8–9.0 keV band (excluding the AGN). The pixel-by-pixel
redshift correction and parabolic gain correction described in the
Tpaper were also applied (eﬀectively meaning that all spectra are
adjusted to match the redshift of 0.017284 determined in Hitomi
Collaboration 2018a). Non X-ray backgrounds were produced us-
ing the task sxsnxbgen and subtracted from the observed spectra.
Spectra were modelled in Xspec 12.9.1h (Arnaud 1996), em-
ploying the modiﬁed C-statistic (Cash 1979). Both AtomDB ver-
sion 3.0.9 (Foster et al. 2012) and the SPEX Atomic Code and Ta-
bles (SPEXACT) version 3.03.00 (Kaastra et al. 1996) were used
to calculate the plasma models under the assumption of collisional
ionisation equilibrium (CIE). A python program was used to gen-
erate APEC format table models from the spectral ﬁtting program

SPEX 31, allowing us to perform a direct comparison of the re-
sults using a consistent treatment of all other assumptions and ﬁt
procedures. Photoelectric absorption by cold matter in our Galaxy
was modelled using the TBabs code version 2.3 (Wilms et al. 2000)
with a ﬁxed hydrogen column density of 1.38×1021 cm−2 (Kalberla
et al. 2005). For extraction regions that include the central AGN, we
added to our model a power-law continuum and a neutral Fe K line
with parameters ﬁxed at the values described in Hitomi Collabora-
tion (2018e). To account for the eﬀects of resonant scattering de-
scribed in Hitomi Collaboration (2018b), the Fe XXV He-α w line
was removed from the thermal plasma models and ﬁtted separately
with a gaussian component with free width and normalisation.

We present the results obtained by modelling the cluster emis-
sion with both a single-temperature and a two-temperature model.
In order to fully utilise the line resolving power of the SXS, as well
as to avoid uncertainties related to the calibration of the eﬀective
area aﬀecting the continuum level, for the single-temperature ﬁt
we allowed the line temperature and the continuum temperature to
vary independently. This is implemented as the bvvtapec model in
Xspec, and referred to as the ‘modiﬁed 1 CIE model’ in the Tpaper
and throughout the rest of this manuscript. For the two-temperature
model (hereafter ‘2 CIE’), an additional component was added to
the ‘modiﬁed 1 CIE model.’ The line and continuum temperatures
for the second component cannot be constrained independently, and
were therefore assumed to have the same value. The metal abun-
dances were linked between the two thermal components in the 2
CIE model.

2.2 XMM-Newton

2.2.1 Reﬂection Grating Spectrometer

The Perseus Cluster is included in the CHemical Evolution RGS
Sample (CHEERS) (de Plaa et al. 2017), and we follow the data
analysis methods laid out by the CHEERS collaboration. In brief,
the RGS observations were reduced in the standard way using the
XMM-Newton Science Analysis Software (SAS) version 14.0.0.
RGS light curves extracted from CCD number 9, where hardly any
source emission is expected, were examined, and all time intervals
with a count rate deviating from the mean by more than 2σ were
excluded in order to avoid contamination from soft-proton ﬂares.

We extract the RGS source spectra in a region centered on
the peak of the source emission, with a width of 0.8(cid:48) in the cross-
dispersion direction. We use the model background spectrum cre-
ated by the standard RGS pipeline, which is a template background
ﬁle that is rescaled based on the count rate in CCD9 of the RGS. We
use the SPEX software package to ﬁt the RGS 1 and 2 source spec-
tra for the observations listed in Table 1 in parallel, with the relative
instrument normalisations treated as free parameters to account for
any small diﬀerences in calibration between the individual detec-
tors and observations.

Since the RGS is a slit-less spectrometer, photons originat-
ing from a region near the cluster center, but oﬀset in the direc-
tion along the dispersion axis, will be slightly shifted in wavelength
with respect to line emission from the cluster center. To correct for
this eﬀect, we use the surface brightness proﬁle extracted from the
XMM-Newton MOS1 detector, whose DETY coordinate direction
is parallel to the dispersion direction in RGS1 and RGS2. This spa-
tial proﬁle is convolved with the model spectrum during spectral
ﬁtting, using the lpro model component in SPEX.

The spectra were ﬁt in the 8–21Å wavelength range using a
two-temperature model plus a power-law component accounting
for the central AGN. The power-law index was ﬁxed to 1.9 (with
the normalization left free in the ﬁt) and the redshift was ﬁxed to
0.017284 (corresponding to the assumption for the Hitomi SXS
analysis). The lpro model allows for wavelength shifts, includ-
ing any uncertainty on the assumed redshift. Galactic absorption
was modeled as a hot component in SPEX, with a ﬁxed2 hydro-
gen column density of nH = 1.38 × 1021 cm−2. The abundances
of O, Ne, Mg, Fe, and Ni, as well as the spatial broadening and
wavelength shift in the lpro model, were coupled between the two
plasma temperature components and left free in the ﬁt; the abun-
dances of all other chemical elements are ﬁxed to 1 Solar. The
lpro model parameters were allowed to vary independently for
observations performed in diﬀerent years (2001 versus 2006). We
model the spectra using both the AtomDB v3.0.9 and SPEXACT
v3.03.00 emission line databases. However, because an equivalent
of the lpro model is not available in Xspec, the AtomDB v3.0.9
ﬁt is performed within SPEX. This is achieved by implementing a
user model that calls Xspec externally for every function evalua-
tion required by the ﬁt and returns the model calculation to SPEX.

2.2.2 European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC)

We reduced the data from the two MOS (metal oxide semiconduc-
tor) and one pn camera onboard XMM-Newton in the standard way,

2 when allowed as a free parameter in the 2T SPEXACT ﬁt, the best-ﬁt nH
is within 5% of the assumed value from Kalberla et al. (2005).

using the Science Analysis System (SAS) v14.0.0. The procedure is
described in detail in Mernier et al. (2015) and summarised below.
Soft proton ﬂares are removed using light curves in the 10–
12 keV energy band for MOS and 12–14 keV for pn, with a time
binning of 100 s; time intervals for which the count rate deviates by
more than 2σ from the mean value are excluded from the analysis.
We then repeat the procedure for the 0.3–10 keV band using 10 s
time bins. For spectroscopy, we impose the condition FLAG==0 to
select only the highest quality events, and we restrict the analysis
to the single to quadruple pixel MOS events (PATTERN (cid:54) 12), and
the single pixel pn events (PATTERN==0).

We extract spectra from a 3 × 3 arcmin box centred on (α
3:19:44.56, δ +41:31:13.36), with a position angle of 73 degrees.
This corresponds to the full ﬁeld of view of the longest Hitomi SXS
observations (ObsID 100400[2,3,4,5]0). A circular region with a
radius of 10(cid:48)(cid:48) around the central AGN was excised from the anal-
ysis. Instrument response ﬁles are generated using the dedicated
tasks rmfgen and arfgen.

We ﬁt the spectra using the SPEX package, employing a two-
temperature model modiﬁed by Galactic absorption, with the ele-
mental abundances assumed to be the same for both thermal com-
ponents. The metals whose abundances are not constrained by the
ﬁt are assumed to have the same concentration with respect to H
(expressed in Solar units) as Fe. The Galactic absorption is de-
scribed as a ‘hot’ model component with kT = 0.5 eV. We model
the local hot bubble, galactic thermal emission, unresolved point
sources, hard particle background, and soft-proton background fol-
lowing the method described extensively in Mernier et al. (2015,
2016a). The temperatures, spectral normalisations, and abundances
of the model components describing the cluster emission are al-
lowed to vary independently for MOS and pn. The Galactic absorp-
tion column density was free to vary, but assumed to be the same for
all spectra; as a consequence, the O abundance was also assumed to
be the same for both MOS and pn. To counteract small diﬀerences
in calibration, the redshifts and an overall normalisation factor of
order unity were allowed as free parameters for each detector of
each observation. Since Ne lines are blended within the Fe-L com-
plex, and since the shape of this spectral feature provides a strong
constraint on the multi-temperature structure, we have chosen to ﬁx
the Ne/Fe value in the ﬁt to that determined using the RGS.

The parameters (temperature, metal abundances, and spectral
normalisation) of the two CIE models were ﬁrst constrained based
on a ‘global ﬁt’ in the 0.6–10 keV band for pn and 0.5–10 keV
for MOS. For all elements except Ne and Fe (for which Fe L-shell
emission is important in the spectrum), we also re-ﬁt EPIC spec-
tra within local bands successively centred around the strongest K-
shell lines of each element, leaving only the (local) normalisation,
redshift, and the abundance of that metal free and ﬁxing all other
parameters to their global best-ﬁt values (hereafter referred to as
‘local ﬁts’). The boundaries of these local energy bands are, respec-
tively, 0.51–0.77 keV for O, 1.36–1.59 keV for Mg, 1.65–2.26 keV
for Si, 2.37–2.77 keV for S, 2.77–3.50 keV for Ar, 3.60–4.44 keV
for Ca, 5.01–5.90 keV for Cr, 5.70–6.29 keV for Mn, and 7.24–8.02

2.3 Suzaku X-ray Imaging Spectrometer

The Perseus Cluster was used as a Suzaku calibration source and, as
such, was observed regularly throughout the lifetime of the satellite.
We analyzed the data from all observations in the Suzaku archive
where the front illuminated XIS 0, 2 and 3, and back illuminated
XIS 1, were used in normal clocking mode and with no window

option. XIS 2 was lost to a putative micrometeoroid hit on 2006
November 9 and therefore its data are available only for a small
fraction of the observations. The total exposure time with Suzaku
XIS is 682 ks.

Initial cleaned event lists were obtained using the standard
screening criteria proposed by the XIS team 3. We ﬁltered out times
of low geomagnetic cut-oﬀ rigidity (imposing the condition COR
> 6 GV). For the XIS 1 data obtained after the reported charge-
injection level increase on 2011 June 1, we have excluded two ad-
jacent rows on either side of the charge-injected rows. The instru-
mental background was determined in a standard way using night-
Earth data. Tamura et al. (2009) estimate that the cosmic X-ray
background is well below 1% of the source over almost the en-
tire energy band, and we have therefore ignored this cosmic back-
ground in the analysis.

As for the EPIC analysis, we extract spectra from a spatial
region corresponding to the full ﬁeld of view of the longest Hit-
omi SXS observations. However, the Suzaku point spread function
does not allow us to isolate the emission from the central AGN;
hence, this is modelled as a separate spectral component. We ﬁt
the data in XSPEC using the 0.6–8.5 keV energy band for the
back-illuminated XIS1, and 0.7–8.5 keV for the front-illuminated
XIS0,2,3. To avoid calibration errors, we ignored energy ranges
around the Si-K edge (1.6–1.95 keV) and the Au-M edge (2.2–2.4
keV). We model the spectra using a two-temperature model plus
a power-law component with free normalization and a ﬁxed index
of 1.9. We present results using both AtomDB 3.0.9 and SPEX-
ACT 3.03.00. The Galactic absorption column density and redshift
were left as free parameters in the ﬁt. The data for each detector
of each observation was ﬁt with the same spectral model, up to an
overall normalization constant of order 1 that was left free in the
ﬁt in order to mitigate the eﬀects of small diﬀerences in calibration
between the individual detectors and their possible evolution over
the lifetime of the satellite. Suzaku XIS data allows us to constrain
the abundances of O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni,
which were assumed to be the same for both plasma temperature
components.

In order to allow a closer comparison to the XMM-Newton
EPIC analysis, we also present the constraints obtained by ﬁxing
the SPEXACT model parameters to their values measured from the
broad band, and re-ﬁtting the Suzaku spectra within narrow energy
ranges centred around the strongest K-shell lines of each element,
allowing the abundance of that respective element to vary. For these
‘local ﬁts’, an overall normalisation of order unity was left free for
each detector of each observation, allowing the local continuum to
adjust in order to compensate for any calibration inaccuracies; one
overall redshift (coupled between all Suzaku spectra) was also free
to vary during the ﬁt procedure.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Constraints on the spatial variation of metal abundance

ratios obtained with the Hitomi SXS

As detailed in the Tpaper, we use the Hitomi SXS observations
to investigate the spectral properties for four diﬀerent spatial re-
gions. The ‘entire core’ refers to the combined spectra from Ob-
sIDs 10040020, 10040030, 10040040, 10040050, and 10040060.

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

To look for any spatial variations, we divided this ‘entire core’ re-
gion into the ‘nebula’ region, where Hα emission was reported by
Conselice et al. (2001), and the ‘rim’ region located just beyond
this multi-phase core. Lastly the fourth region, which we refer to
as the ‘outer region’, is the entire FoV of ObsID 10040010, which
is oﬀset by ∼ 3(cid:48) towards the west-southwest of the Perseus Clus-
ter core. We refer the reader to Figure 1 of the Tpaper for a visual
representation of the choice of spatial regions, and to the contents
of that manuscript for a discussion of the detailed thermal structure
obtained from this analysis.

The best-ﬁt Fe abundance and ratios of other elements with
respect to Fe are summarised in Table 2. For the ‘entire core’, ‘neb-
ula’, and ‘rim’ regions, we show the results using both the ‘modi-
ﬁed 1 CIE’ and ‘2 CIE’ models described above; in the ‘outer’ re-
gion, including a second temperature component does not improve
the ﬁt signiﬁcantly and hence we only show the metal abundances
obtained from a single-temperature (‘modiﬁed 1 CIE’) model. We
ﬁnd an encouraging agreement between the results obtained with
AtomDB and SPEXACT. On the other hand, the best-ﬁt metal
abundances are sensitive to the assumed temperature structure, with
the ‘2 CIE’ model giving lower α-element to Fe ratios than the
‘modiﬁed 1 CIE’ model. As discussed in the Tpaper, the eﬀective
area calibration is an additional source of uncertainty that aﬀects
the measurements. Since the in-ﬂight calibration of Hitomi was not
completed because of its short life time, we assessed this uncer-
tainty using the modiﬁed ancillary response ﬁle (ARF) based on
the ground telescope calibration and the observed Crab data (Tsu-
jimoto et al. 2018). The best-ﬁt metal abundance ratios obtained
for the highest quality ‘entire core’ spectrum with these alterna-
tive choices of eﬀective area calibration are also given in Table 2;
the magnitude of the systematic error is similar to the extent of the
diﬀerences between the ‘modiﬁed 1 CIE’ and ‘2 CIE’ models.

Figure 1 compares the measured chemical abundance patterns
for the three spatially distinct regions considered here (‘nebula’,
‘rim’, and ‘outer’), using the standard ARF. While we ﬁnd a signif-
icant radial gradient in the Fe abundance (that decreases by ∼ 30%
from the ‘nebula’ to the ‘outer’ region), taking into account the sys-
tematic uncertainties described above, no signiﬁcant radial trends
in the relative abundances of other chemical elements with respect
to Fe are identiﬁed; the chemical composition of the ICM is roughly
consistent with the Solar metal abundance pattern in all of the spa-
tial regions considered.

3.2 Search for emission lines from rare elements

One of the main advantages of high-resolution spectroscopy is the
increased sensitivity to weak emission lines, and accuracy with
which these lines can be separated from the underlying continuum
emission. The Hitomi SXS observations of the core of the Perseus
Cluster allow us to easily identify emission lines from Cr and Mn
(see also ZNpaper). Hence, we have also searched for emission
from even weaker lines of other rare elements using the spectra
extracted from the ‘entire core’ region. No detection is found with
high conﬁdence, although hints of Al Lyβ, a blend of Cl Lyα and
K Heα, and Ti Heα are seen with a signiﬁcance between 1 − 2σ.
This is expected, as Kitayama et al. (2014) report that an exposure
time of at least 625 ks would be required to detect P, K, Ti, and
Co with a signiﬁcance above 5σ; Al and Cl should be detected in
much shorter exposure times using the full capabilities of the SXS,
but are not seen in our observation because the closed gate valve
limits the band pass and eﬀective area at softer energies.

In order to obtain approximate constraints on the abundances

of Al, Cl, K, and Ti, we then ﬁtted the ‘modiﬁed 1 CIE’ model to

element in each case (1.9–2.05 keV for Al, 2.65–3.03 keV for Cl,
3.3–3.7 keV for K, and 5.44–4.72 keV for Ti). All model param-
eters were ﬁxed based on the Tpaper, except the overall spectrum
normalisation (allowed to vary in order to account for any uncer-
tainties in calibrating the local continuum), the redshift, and the
abundances of any elements whose emission lines are found in the
considered local energy band. Figure 2 shows an example of the

spectral ﬁt around the Al Lyβ emission line (at a rest-frame en-
ergy of 2048.1 eV). For spectral plots of other energy bands con-
taining the Cl, K, and Ti lines, we refer the reader to Figure 1
of Aharonian et al. (2017) and Figure 24 of Hitomi Collaboration
(2018d) (hereafter Atomic paper).

Using AtomDB 3.0.9, we obtain 1σ conﬁdence intervals of
(2.2–7.8) for Al/Fe, (0.9–2.8) for Cl/Fe, (0.1–1.3) for K/Fe, and
(0.4–1.6) for Ti/Fe. Given the very large statistical uncertainties,
systematic errors due to the assumed temperature structure (‘modi-
ﬁed 1 CIE’ or ‘2 CIE’), as well as the atomic line emission models
(AtomDB or SPEXACT) are subdominant and not reported here.

Within these large statistical uncertainties, the abundances of
the rare elements with respect to Fe appear consistent with the So-
lar abundance pattern. We note, however, low-signiﬁcance hints of
super-solar Al/Fe. Nucleosynthesis models indicate that the abun-
dances of odd-Z elements like Al and Na depend on the initial
metallicity of core-collapse supernova progenitors (Nomoto et al.
2006; Kobayashi et al. 2006; Nomoto et al. 2013). While the cur-
rent data quality does not allow us to draw any ﬁrm conclusions, a
high abundance of Al, if conﬁrmed by future measurements, would
be a particularly interesting tracer of the properties of the under-
lying stellar population responsible for the enrichment. An alterna-
tive explanation for the inferred high abundance of Al is that its Lyβ
line may be blended with satellite transitions of Fe XXV charge ex-
change (CX) emission around a rest frame of 2.05 keV (Gu et al.
2016). The Atomic paper suggests a hint for Fe XXV CX direct
emission at ∼ 8.6 keV at 2.4σ signiﬁcance, in which case weak
emission from additional satellite lines could be naturally expected.

3.3 Abundances of light elements measured from the

XMM-Newton RGS

The best-ﬁt parameters obtained by performing a two-temperature
ﬁt to the XMM-Newton RGS archival data are presented in Table 3.
In Figure 3, the spectral models are compared to the stacked and
binned data obtained from both detectors (RGS1 and RGS2) and
from all observations used to constrain the ﬁt. While the RGS ex-
traction region is much narrower than the SXS FOV (0.8 compared
to 3 arcmin), we consider it to oﬀer the most reliable measurements
of the typical properties of the Perseus Cluster core, since the spec-
tral resolution is least degraded by the spatial extent of the source.
Since the use of AtomDB within the SPEX spectral ﬁtting
package was only implemented very recently, following the launch
of Hitomi, this oﬀers us one of the ﬁrst glimpses into directly com-
paring the two atomic line emission data bases in the soft X-ray
band using grating spectra. While Figure 3 shows that SPEXACT
and AtomDB produce nearly indistinguishable model curves, the
best-ﬁt parameters are somewhat diﬀerent, with AtomDB giving
higher temperatures, lower normalisations, and a slightly improved
C-stat compared to SPEXACT. In addition, while the Fe measure-
ments agree for both models, we notice important diﬀerences in the
best-ﬁt abundance ratios, with AtomDB giving O/Fe and Ne/Fe val-
ues that are roughly 30% higher than SPEXACT, while the Mg/Fe
values are consistent between the two codes. Within the statistical
error bars and the systematic uncertainty introduced by diﬀerences
between the atomic codes, all measured ratios are consistent with
the Solar composition, in line with the results for heavier elements
from Si to Ni revealed by Hitomi. We have furthermore checked
that the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios obtained by ﬁtting the sec-
ond order RGS spectra are in agreement with the ﬁrst order spectra
presented here.

We note several discrepancies between the RGS and Hitomi

SXS best-ﬁt parameters. Firstly, as discussed in detail in the Tpaper,
the best-ﬁt thermal structure for the two data sets is diﬀerent, with
the RGS spectra preferring much lower temperatures than the SXS.
This due to a combination of factors, including the diﬀerent en-
ergy bands that the two detectors are sensitive to, diﬀerent eﬀective
spatial extraction regions, and cross-calibration uncertainties. Sec-
ondly, due to the limited bandwidth of the RGS and thus the lack of
line-free continuum, the absolute abundance of Fe is strongly de-
generate with respect to the normalisation of the CIE component(s);
this would explain the lower Fe abundance measured with the RGS
compared to the SXS. Abundance ratios however, such as O/Fe,
Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, should not suﬀer from this degeneracy and are more
reliable than the absolute RGS abundance measurements. We refer
the reader to de Plaa et al. (2017) for a comprehensive discussion of
the systematic uncertainties associated with measuring these metal
abundance ratios from RGS spectra.

3.4 Summary of the chemical composition in the Perseus

Cluster core measured from high-resolution spectroscopy

To obtain one uniﬁed set of abundances that can be compared to
predictions from supernova yield calculations, we have combined
the results presented above (O, Ne, Mg from RGS, and Si through
Ni from the SXS ‘entire core’ region). As shown in the Tpaper,
the multi-phase thermal structure in the Hitomi spectrum is consis-
tent with the expected eﬀects of projecting the radial temperature
gradient known to exist in the cluster core along the line of sight;
hence, the ‘2 CIE’ models provide a better description of the data
(both in terms of the ﬁt quality and as a better approximation of
the physical characteristics of the cluster) and we will focus exclu-
sively on these results for the remainder of the manuscript. Figure 4
shows the best-ﬁt metal abundance ratios using the ‘standard’ ARF,
assuming a ‘2 CIE’ AtomDB and SPEXACT model.

As mentioned above, the assumed eﬀective area calibration in-
troduces a systematic uncertainty in the results. In addition to tests
with the ‘ground’ and ‘crab’ ARF shown in Table 2, the Atomic
paper presents an alternative method wherein residual calibration
errors on the eﬀective area are accounted for using correction func-
tions whose parameters are estimated within SPEX (see Appendix
1.2 of that paper), while on the other hand assuming the continuum
and line temperatures to be the same (unlike the approach used in
the Tpaper and adopted here). For comparison, the results of the
two-temperature model given in the Atomic paper are also shown
in Figure 4.

We hence estimate the total uncertainty budget for each of the
measured abundance ratios as follows. For O, Ne, Mg, we aver-
aged the abundances obtained from AtomDB and SPEXACT, and
added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty a systematic un-
certainty term corresponding to the diﬀerences due to the assumed
atomic data base. Typical uncertainties obtained in this way are of
order 20–30%, comparable to or larger than the expected system-
atic errors related to speciﬁcs of the RGS data analysis (estimated
at around 20% by de Plaa et al. 2017). For the abundances con-
strained from the SXS, we calculate the average among seven dif-
ferent values for each element (a combination of two spectral codes
with ARF ‘standard’, ‘ground’, or ’crab’, plus the Atomic paper
data points, assuming a two-temperature model in all cases). We
then add in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty a systematic
uncertainty term corresponding to the diﬀerence between the mini-
mum and maximum values among the seven measurements. Figure
4 and Table 4 summarise the conﬁdence interval for each metal
abundance ratio obtained in this way.

The excellent quality of the Hitomi SXS data allows the abun-
dance ratios with respect to Fe to be measured with a remarkable
precision of less than 10% for Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, and Ni/Fe, less than
15% for Si/Fe, S/Fe, and Cr/Fe, and 20% for Mn/Fe, when all sys-
tematic uncertainties are taken into account. It is noteworthy that

the abundances of some elements are measured more precisely than
the Solar composition itself. Figure 4 illustrates the diﬀerences be-
tween the Lodders et al. (2009) and Asplund et al. (2009) Solar ref-
erence units. In particular for Ar/Fe, the SXS constraints are much
tighter than the systematic uncertainty associated with the assumed
Solar abundance table. Hence, although X-ray spectra do not allow
us to measure the abundances of various isotopes independently,
our results can serve as an important benchmark for testing theo-
retical supernova yield calculations. This is discussed in detail in
Section 4.2.

3.5 Results from CCD spectroscopy

Prior to the launch of Hitomi, the workhorses of chemical abun-
dance studies in galaxy clusters were primarily XMM-Newton and
Suzaku. In this section, we compare the metal abundance con-
straints obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy to results from
CCD detectors onboard these two satellites. For both Suzaku and
XMM-Newton EPIC data, we reanalysed all available observations
of the Perseus Cluster core using the latest atomic line emission
data base updates, as well as an extraction region matched to the
Hitomi FOV (roughly the ‘entire core’ region). This allows us to
perform the closest possible direct comparison between the results,
varying only the type of detector while using the same atomic
model and sky region wherever possible. We note that, following
‘standard’ analysis methods used in previous chemical enrichment
studies, the eﬀects of resonant scattering were not modelled for
XMM-Newton and Suzaku data (but are expected to be small com-
pared to other systematic uncertainties; see Table 1 of the Atomic
paper and Figure 3 of ZNpaper). Figure 5 shows the count residu-
als obtained by subtracting the line-free continuum from the SXS,
RGS, EPIC, and XIS data, illustrating the X-ray signal used to de-
rive our results and comparing the data quality in each case.

The best-ﬁt parameters obtained using the spectral analysis
and modelling methods presented in Sections 2.2.2 (XMM-Newton
EPIC) and 2.3 (Suzaku XIS) are summarized in Table 5. Because
Ne lines are blended within the Fe-L complex, no ‘local ﬁts’ are
reported for the Ne/Fe values. Moreover, as noted in Section 2.2.2,

Figure 4. Summary of the metal abundance ratios with respect to Fe obtained using only the highest spectral resolution data sets available (O, Ne, Mg/Fe from
XMM-Newton RGS, Si through Ni to Fe ratios from Hitomi SXS). The light blue strip represents the systematic uncertainty on the Hitomi measurements from
the ‘entire core’ region due to the diﬀerences between AtomDB and SPEXACT and the eﬀective area calibration; the inferred conﬁdence range, including
these systematic errors as well as the statistical uncertainties, is shown as a grey strip. The measured values are given with respect to the proto-solar units of
Lodders et al. (2009); for comparison, the dashed grey line shows what the best-ﬁt mean abundance ratios (i.e. the mid-points of the grey strip) would be if
expressed instead in the Solar units of Asplund et al. (2009).

S, Ar, and Ca lines, illustrating why ﬂuctuations as small as ±3–
5% in the continuum level can lead to diﬀerent line ﬂuxes being
measured from various ﬁtting methods (‘local’ vs. ‘global’) and
from diﬀerent instruments. This highlights the importance of using
a high-spectral resolution detector like the SXS for performing pre-
cise measurements of the chemical enrichment history of the ICM;
a more quantitative assessment of the systematic uncertainties as-
sociated with CCD spectroscopy, based on the measurements given
in Table 5, is discussed in Section 4.3.

for the XMM-Newton EPIC analysis, Ne/Fe was tied to the RGS
measurement, and O abundances were coupled between MOS and
pn in the ‘global’ ﬁt. We thus do not report ‘global’ Ne/Fe and O/Fe
for XMM-Newton.

Table 5 shows a large spread in abundance ratios obtained
from various ﬁtting methods (‘local’ vs. ‘global’ ﬁtting) and var-
ious CCD detectors (MOS, pn, and XIS). We have also performed
an additional test in which we re-ﬁtted the MOS and pn spectra
in ‘local’ energy bands while ﬁxing the temperatures and ratio be-
tween the emission measures of the two components to the best-ﬁt
values obtained from Suzaku, and leaving only an overall normal-
ization as free parameter. We ﬁnd that diﬀerences between various
CCD results persist, with a roughly similar spread as before, and
therefore the temperature structure cannot be the leading cause of
these discrepancies. Instead, the inset of Figure 5 shows the diﬀer-
ences between the MOS, pn, and XIS signals around the Mg, Si,

4 DISCUSSION

4.1

Implications of a Solar chemical enrichment pattern in
the core of the Perseus Cluster

The metal abundance ratios summarised in Section 3.4 are remark-
ably close to the composition of the Sun. In fact, a ‘model’ in
which the chemical composition of the core of the Perseus Clus-
ter is exactly Solar (using the reference values of Lodders et al.
2009 adopted throughout this work) provides an excellent match to
the X-ray data, with a χ2 value of 10.7 for 10 degrees of freedom
(d.o.f.) and no free parameters. This is diﬀerent from the metal
abundance ratios typically observed in the most massive galaxies
in the Universe, such as central BCGs. As shown by Conroy et al.
(2014), the relative abundances of α elements, such as O, Mg, and
Si, with respect to Fe, increase as a function of the stellar veloc-
ity dispersion, σ∗, and stellar mass of a galaxy. Massive early type
galaxies with velocity dispersion σ∗ (cid:38) 200 km s−1 have typically
high α/Fe ratios (up to twice the Solar value), which are incon-
sistent with the composition observed in the ICM of the Perseus
Cluster core, as Figure 6 demonstrates. These ratios decrease with
decreasing galaxy mass, reaching near-solar values for less massive
galaxies, with σ∗ approaching 100 km s−1.

The standard interpretation of [α/Fe] is that this ratio is sen-
sitive to the length of the star formation period, with higher val-
ues corresponding to shorter timescales. In giant ellipticals, which
have very short star-formation timescales of < 1 Gyr, and perhaps
as short as 0.2 Gyr (Conroy et al. 2014), there is not enough time
for a signiﬁcant fraction of SN Ia to pollute the interstellar medium
(ISM) before the end of the starburst period. Although SN Ia con-
tinue to produce metals later on, these elements are no longer incor-
porated into stars once star formation ends, leading to a high [α/Fe]
ratio seen in stellar spectra. Galaxies with younger stellar popula-
tions and longer periods of star formation, on the other hand, show

a chemical composition closer to the Solar value and to the abun-
dance pattern observed in the ICM of the Perseus Cluster core.

This trend in [α/Fe] as a function of the timescale/level of
chemical enrichment can be seen even more clearly among individ-
ual stars in the Milky Way, whose abundances can be studied more
directly and with fewer assumptions than by using integrated spec-
tra of more distant galaxies. In Figure 6, we also provide a compar-
ison between the abundance ratios measured in the Perseus Cluster
using X-ray spectroscopy and the average composition of stars in
the Milky Way derived from a large spectroscopic infrared survey
(Hawkins et al. 2016), and high-resolution optical surveys (Bensby
et al. 2014; Battistini & Bensby 2015; Reggiani et al. 2017; Ja-
cobson et al. 2015). The chemical enrichment pattern observed in
the Perseus Cluster core is remarkably similar to the abundance ra-
tios of solar-metallicity stars in our Galaxy, while lower-metallicity
stars (which also formed much earlier than the Sun) show signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced [α/Fe] ratios. The Ca/Fe measurements in partic-
ular can be considered the most robust, since results from diﬀer-
ent stellar observations are consistent, and the [Ca/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]
trend provides a good match to the Galactic chemical evolution
model (Reggiani et al. 2017). The plateau of [Ca/Fe] in metal-poor
stars at twice the Solar ratio indicates that SNcc contribute signif-
icantly towards the production of Ca; as the relative contribution
from SN Ia and consequently [Fe/H] increase, the α-element to Fe
ratio becomes closer to the Solar value. The Hitomi SXS provides
a remarkably precise measurement of the Ca abundance in the ICM
of the Perseus Cluster, and the resulting Ca/Fe ratio is in excellent
agreement with that of Solar-metallicity stars.

Unlike [α/Fe], the ratios of Fe-group elements such as Cr/Fe,
Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe are close to the Solar composition, showing no
dependence on the stellar metallicity (for Milky Way stars), or on
the galaxy stellar mass (for the sample of galaxies considered by
Conroy et al. 2014). Early hints that the Mn/Fe ratio of Galac-

tic stars was decreasing with decreasing metallicity, possibly in-
dicating a diﬀerent origin for Mn than the other Fe-group metals,
were likely attributed to the eﬀects of non local-thermodynamical-
equilibrium (Battistini & Bensby 2015). The good agreement be-
tween the Galactic stars, the early-type galaxy sample of Conroy
et al. 2014, and the Perseus Cluster ICM further indicates that the
production of Cr, Mn, and Ni traces very closely that of Fe, inde-
pendently of the exact details of the chemical enrichment history.
This is expected if these Fe-group elements are all predominantly
produced through the same nucleosynthesis channel (namely, SN Ia
explosions with similar progenitor properties).

As summarised in Section 1, recent results (using either
moderate-resolution CCD spectroscopy or high-resolution spec-
troscopy based on a few elemental ratios only) point towards the
emerging picture of an ICM chemical composition that is consistent
with Solar and does not vary signiﬁcantly with radius, with [Fe/H],
or from cluster to cluster. Our present results, compiling the most
accurate abundance measurements that can be constrained in the
Perseus Cluster to date, are the latest addition in this line of recent
evidence, as they support both a Solar composition of the ICM (as
shown above), and a lack of spatial gradient in the chemical enrich-
ment pattern of all observed elements (Section 3.1). Unfortunately,
our measurements are limited to the central core (within ∼100 kpc),
containing a small fraction of the total ICM mass, and representing
an area within which the mass of metals trapped in stars is com-
parable to that in the gas component. Precise measurements of the
metal abundance ratios over a larger volume and in a larger sample
of systems are needed to further improve our understanding of the
chemical enrichment history of the ICM as a whole.

Nevertheless, it is worth noting that retrieving Solar abun-
dance ratios in the vicinity of Perseus Cluster’s BCG is surpris-
ing, at least at ﬁrst glance. The stellar population of the BCG it-
self, as argued above, is expected to have super-solar [α/Fe] ratios
which could contribute to the enrichment of the ICM through stellar
winds; on the other hand, SNcc are very rare in early-type galaxies
(Graham et al. 2012), such that the metal output by these old stellar
populations is dominated by SN Ia (Mannucci et al. 2008), reducing
the [α/Fe] in the ICM. It would be remarkable if these two enrich-
ment sources compensated each other to such a precision that the
composition of the ICM remains Solar, even within the small error
bars aﬀorded by the Hitomi SXS. However, one could also argue
that, when systems have a similar initial stellar mass function and
are old enough, such that most supernovae (both early core-collapse
and longer time scale SNIa) have already exploded, the abundance
pattern might be expected to be similar, even if the instantaneous
rate of release of metals into the surrounding gas has been diﬀerent
from system to system over time.

4.2 Constraints on the contribution from diﬀerent supernova

yield models to the enrichment of the ICM

Since we ﬁnd such a good agreement between the chemical enrich-
ment pattern in the Solar neighbourhood, typical Milky Way stars,
and the ICM in the core of the Perseus Cluster, it is important to test
how well current supernova yield calculations are able to reproduce
this abundance pattern that seems to pervade the Universe. To this
end, we construct a model consisting of a linear combination of the-
oretical SN Ia and SNcc yields from the literature, and compare it
to the observations. The various theoretical supernova yield calcu-
lations considered here are listed in Table 6, and described below.

(i) older calculations of “classical” SN Ia yields, focusing on
the most widely used WDD1,2,3 and W7 models of Iwamoto et al.
(1999);

(ii) a recent update of the WDD2 and W7 models using revised
electron capture and nuclear reaction rates (Nomoto & Leung 2018)
4;

(iii) two-dimensional delayed detonation near-Chandrasekhar
mass (MCh) explosion models from the 300-Z-c3-1 series of Le-
ung & Nomoto (2018), in order to study the eﬀect of progenitor
metallicity Z on the metal yields;

(iv) the latest

three-dimensional calculations for a delayed-
detonation of a near-MCh progenitor (model N100 from Seitenzahl
et al. 2013);

(v) as an alternative to the N100 model, we also test the 500-1-
c3-1 model from Leung & Nomoto (2018), which assumes a higher
central density of a single-degenerate progenitor such that neutron-
rich species are generated more eﬃciently;

(vi) a double degenerate scenario consisting of a violent merger
between two sub-MCh white dwarfs, described by model ‘1.1-0.9’
of Pakmor et al. (2012);

(vii) a

“dynamically-driven

double-
detonation” scenario (‘DDDDDD’), in which only one of the
white dwarfs involved in the collision is detonated (“mass = 1.0
M(cid:12), C/O = 50/50, metallicity = 0.02, 12+16 = 1.0” model from
Shen et al. 2018);

double-degenerate

While a variety of other SN Ia nucleosynthesis models is available
in recent literature, the ones listed above match the properties of
typical SN Ia explosions (e.g., the mass of 56Ni and hence the max-
imum brightness) most closely.

In terms of the core-collapse supernova yield calculations, we

consider:

(i) the “classical” mass-dependent values of Nomoto et al.
(2006, 2013) for various progenitor metallicities, averaged over an
initial mass function (IMF) assumed to have a power-law shape.
The most common assumption is that of a Salpeter IMF (Salpeter
1955) with slope -2.35 (hereafter ‘SP’), but we also test a shallower,
top-heavy IMF with a slope of -1.35 (hereafter ‘TH’).

(ii) more recent calculations by Sukhbold et al. (2016) which in-
clude a one-dimensional neutrino transport model for the explosion
and are calibrated to reproduce the observed energy for SN 1987A
(speciﬁcally, models W18 and N20 from that work).

For a combination of a single SN Ia and a single SNcc model,
the ﬁt has one free parameter representing the relative number of
SN Ia over the total number of SNe responsible for the enrichment
(which we denote as fIa). In addition, ZNpaper focused on the rel-
ative abundances of Fe-group elements determined from the SXS
spectra to show that a mixture of sub- and near-MCh SN Ia progen-
itors is preferred. Therefore, we also consider linear combinations
of two diﬀerent types of SN Ia progenitors together with a given
SNcc yield model. This introduces a second possible free parame-
ter, the fraction of near-MCh SN Ia explosions with respect to the
total number of SN Ia responsible for the enrichment (which we
denote as fch). The subsections that follow describe the constraints
on these parameters, and the extent to which the models are able to
reproduce the measured chemical enrichment pattern in the Perseus
Cluster core determined in Section 3.4.

As possible model yields for SN Ia, we use:

4.2.1 “Classical” supernova yield calculations

First, we consider models consisting of a linear combination of the
“classical” and widely used supernova yields from Iwamoto et al.
(1999) for SN Ia and Nomoto et al. (2006, 2013) for SNcc, with
fIa as the only free parameter. Since O, Ne, and Mg are mainly
forged by SNcc, their relative abundances compared to Fe, which is
a predominantly SN Ia product, are most sensitive to fIa. However,
due to the diﬀerent sensitivities of the RGS and SXS, the relative

error bars on the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios are signiﬁcantly
larger than the uncertainties in determining Si/Fe through Ni/Fe.
This could lead to biases wherein the best-ﬁt model misses the light
α-element to Fe measurements by a large margin in order to com-
pensate for uncertainties/imperfections in the model yields. Hence,
for the cases where fIa is the only free parameter, we have chosen to
estimate its best-ﬁt value using only O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe. The
constraints obtained in this way are summarised in Table 7, show-
ing both the χ2 value that was minimised in the ﬁt procedure (in

Table 7. Results of ﬁtting a combination of SNcc and SNIa yield models to the metal abundance ratios observed in the core of the Perseus Cluster. When fIa
is the only free parameter in the ﬁt, the χ2 value is minimised using only the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe measurements; when both fIa and fch are allowed to
vary, O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe are used to constrain the ﬁt parameters. The model obtained in this way is then extrapolated to the other
abundance measurements not used in the ﬁt procedure (denoted χ2/all). For a small subset of model combinations, we also show the results obtained if all 10
abundance ratios are used to constrain the ﬁt; in this case, the two χ2 columns are merged.

this case, for two degrees of freedom given by three data points and
one free parameter), and the χ2 value obtained by extrapolating the
resulting model to all 10 abundance measurements constrained by
the SXS/RGS data; the top panel of Figure 7 over-plots the model
predictions and the observed chemical enrichment pattern in the
core of the Perseus Cluster.

Within this set of models, the best-ﬁt values obtained for fIa
are in the range 21 ± 4%, independent of the choice of exact SN Ia
and SNcc progenitor properties. Figure 7 shows that signiﬁcantly
more precise measurements of the O, Ne, and Mg abundances are
needed to distinguish between various assumptions employed for
the SNcc yields. It is notable that, while slightly increasing the rel-
ative number of core-collapse supernovae that contribute to the en-
richment, a top-heavy IMF has a barely noticeable eﬀect on the
resulting abundance patterns, which will be diﬃcult to constrain
even with a marked improvement in data quality. The initial metal-
licity of the SNcc progenitors on the other hand has a larger im-
pact on the predicted O/Ne/Mg ratios than the assumed IMF; fu-
ture observations can be used to constrain this parameter but, at
present, the diﬀerences between models are still smaller than the
error bars associated with the current measurements. Throughout
the remainder of this manuscript, we will then focus on the ‘natu-
ral’ choice of Solar progenitor metallicity and Salpeter IMF. Note
that a top-heavy IMF is disfavoured by other considerations, such
as the observed metal-mass-to-light ratios in galaxy clusters (Mat-
sushita et al. 2013).

While the observed O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios are repro-
duced well by any choice of models in Figure 7, several noteworthy
discrepancies can be seen for other elements.

In terms of the Fe-group metals, it has long been proposed
that the nickel-to-iron ratio in the ICM can be used as a discrim-
inator between SN Ia explosion models, with high Ni/Fe pointing
towards a slow deﬂagration (W7) model, whereas delayed detona-

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

tion scenarios would result in a lower value of this ratio (Dupke
& White 2000). Figure 7 indeed shows the dramatic diﬀerence in
predicted Ni/Fe for the “classical” SN Ia yields of Iwamoto et al.
(1999). It is important to note, however, that updating the elec-
tron capture and nuclear reaction rates results in a substantially
diﬀerent Ni production. While deﬂagration models still result in
a larger Ni/Fe compared to delayed detonation models, this diﬀer-
ence is reduced signiﬁcantly compared to the older calculations of
Iwamoto et al. (1999). The largest diﬀerence between the ‘W7new’
and ‘WDD2new’ model (Nomoto & Leung 2018) is now in the
Cr/Fe ratio, which is much higher for the delayed detonation than
for the deﬂagration explosion.

Among the models tested in this subsection, the Nomoto et al.
(2006) SNcc calculations with Salpeter IMF and Solar initial metal-
licity of the progenitor, combined with the updated W7 SN Ia
deﬂagration model of Nomoto & Leung (2018), provide the best
description of the observed Perseus abundance pattern. However,
comparing this model to the 10 metal abundance ratios constrained
by the SXS/RGS data, we still obtain a high (extrapolated) χ2 value
of 30.38. For this model combination, we also provide a ﬁt obtained
by using all measured abundance ratios to minimise the χ2. The ﬁt
is still not acceptable, with χ2 = 25.91 for 9 d.o.f., and the value of
fIa is biased low compared to the ﬁt using only the light α-element
to Fe ratios. This model combination over-predicts all Fe-group to
Fe abundances compared to the observed data.

In addition, the abundances of intermediate α-elements are
also not reproduced well by the models considered so far. In partic-
ular, Si/Ar and Si/Ca are always over predicted, such that Ar and Ca
are underproduced when Si is well-ﬁt, and Si is overproduced when
Ar and Ca are well ﬁt. Similar ﬁt residuals for these intermediate
elements have been reported from previous CCD measurements of
the cluster sample presented by Mernier et al. (2016b), as well as
earlier work by de Plaa et al. (2007). Several solutions have been

et al. (1999); their updated calculations with revised electron capture and nuclear reaction rates by Nomoto & Leung (2018) are the labeled ‘new’. For SNcc,
we use the calculations of Nomoto et al. (2006, 2013), with Solar (‘Zsun’) or 0.2 Solar metallicity (‘0.2Zsun’), and assuming a Salpeter (‘SP’) or top-heavy
(‘TH’) IMF, as indicated by the labels. Bottom: Solid lines assume the ‘Nomoto Zsun SP’ SNcc yields, together with various SN Ia progenitor metallicities

data points with error bars show the conﬁdence range of the SXS/RGS measurements (Table 4), and the blue band illustrates the eﬀects of varying fIa within

we present the conﬁdence interval obtained by ﬁtting all data points.

discussed to explain the deﬁcit of calcium produced in theoretical
supernova models compared to values measured in the ICM us-
ing XMM-Newton data. de Plaa et al. (2007) suggest that using the
yields from an empirically modiﬁed delayed-detonation model cali-
brated on the Tycho type Ia supernova remnant improves the agree-
ment between the predicted and observed Ca/Fe. Alternatively, a
possible subclass of SNIa called “calcium-rich gap transients” may
also contribute to the enrichment of the ICM (Mulchaey et al.
2014). However, delayed detonation models tend to signiﬁcantly
over produce Cr (see above), and calcium-rich gap transients only
have a very minor contribution to Ar production (Mernier et al.
2016b). Hence, these previous explanations are not likely to ad-
dress the problem that the observed Si/Ar ratio is lower than the
model predictions for all cases tested in Figure 7.

These “classical” yield calculations, though still widely used
as baseline models in the literature until recently, were proposed
almost two decades ago. Since then, there have been recent im-
provements not only in the electron capture and nuclear reaction

rates (see above), but also in modelling 2D and 3D explosions (in-
troducing possible asymmetries in their geometry) as well as in pre-
dicting the SN Ia yield dependencies as a function of various prop-
erties of the progenitor and the explosion mechanism. Moreover,
for the best-ﬁt values of fIa presented here, the contribution from
SNcc always represents more than 50% of the total Si, S, Ar, Ca
budget predicted by the models. Updates to SNcc nucleosynthesis
calculations may therefore be equally important for improving the
agreement with the observed abundance pattern in the ICM. These
start-of-the-art models are considered in the next subsections.

4.2.2 Dependence on the SN Ia progenitor metallicity

As shown in the previous section, “classical” SN Ia yield models do
not reproduce well the observed Fe-group to Fe abundance ratios,
both in the case of delayed-detonation and deﬂagration models,
even when the latest electron capture and nuclear reaction rates are
applied. Here, we investigate whether relaxing the assumption of a

Solar SN Ia progenitor metallicity can lead to an improvement in
the ﬁt results. To this end, we begin by considering combinations of
the Nomoto et al. (2006) SNcc calculations with Salpeter IMF and
Solar initial metallicity, together with the delayed detonation single
degenerate explosion models from the 300-Z-c3-1 series of Leung
& Nomoto (2018) (where Z stands for the assumed SN Ia progen-
itor metallicity). Following the argument presented above, we rely
on the light α-element to Fe ratios to constrain fIa as the only free
parameter in the ﬁt. The results are given in Table 7 and illustrated
in the bottom panel of Figure 7. While the goodness-of-ﬁt for the
Solar progenitor metallicity SN Ia model of the 300-Z-c3-1 series
is similar to that obtained using the classical ‘W7new’ yields above
(with a χ2 of 30.90 compared to 30.38 for ‘W7new’), calculations
with a lower initial metallicity of the SN Ia result in lower Mn/Fe
and Ni/Fe (and a slight increase in Cr/Fe), providing overall a better
description of the data. Note that a similar trend of the Mn/Fe and
Ni/Fe as a function of initial metallicity of the SN Ia progenitor is
also found in the 3D calculations of Seitenzahl et al. (2013). Figure
7 also shows that the Cr/Fe ratio is signiﬁcantly reduced between
the 1D (e.g. ‘WDD2new’) and 2D (300-1-c3-1) delayed detonation
models, even for the same initial progenitor metallicity. The best ﬁt
is obtained by mixing the Nomoto et al. (2006) SNcc calculations
with Salpeter IMF and Solar initial metallicity and the zero metal-
licity model (300-0-c3-1) of Leung & Nomoto (2018). In fact, this
combination provides a statistically acceptable description of the
measurements; including all data points to constrain the ﬁt, we ob-
tain χ2 = 11.78 for 9 d.o.f.

Nevertheless, it seems somewhat unphysical to assume that
the SN Ia and SNcc progenitor metallicity would be so diﬀerent.
Models where both the initial metallicity of the SNcc and the SN Ia
are sub-Solar, on the other hand, provide signiﬁcantly worse ﬁts:
assuming SNcc progenitors with 0.2Z(cid:12), together with 0 metallic-
ity SN Ia, gives a clearly unacceptable χ2 = 54.82 (mainly due
to a very high Si and S compared to O, Ne, and Mg). Given that
several other lines of evidence had previously suggested an early
enrichment scenario in which many of the SN Ia that enrich the
ICM exploded already during the proto-cluster phase (e.g. Werner
et al. 2013; Mantz et al. 2017), it is tantalising to consider the pos-
sibility that these SN Ia progenitors may have indeed had a highly
sub-Solar metal content. However, the Fe-group to Fe abundance
ratios are sensitive to several other factors in addition to the pro-
genitor metallicity – in particular, various scenarios for sub- and
near-MCh SN Ia explosions can aﬀect the predicted yields signiﬁ-
cantly. In the following sections, we focus on searching for alterna-
tive model combinations that can explain the observed abundance
pattern without assuming a large discrepancy between the SN Ia
and SNcc progenitor metallicities.

4.2.3 Combinations of near- and sub-MCh SN Ia progenitors

As argued in ZNpaper, linear combinations of sub- and near-MCh
SN Ia progenitors also provide a good match to the Fe-group to Fe
abundance ratios observed in the Perseus Cluster. While the ZN-
paper assumed a 1:1 ratio between these two explosion channels,
here we attempt to constrain their relative contribution more quan-
titatively. To this end, we model the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Cr/Fe,
Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe data points with fIa and fch as free parameters.
The ratios of light elements with respect to Fe should determine
the best-ﬁt fIa, while the abundances of Fe-group elements should
be relatively insensitive to the choice of SNcc model and should
constrain fch. The abundances of intermediate elements (Si to Ca),
for which the dependance on fIa and fch is much more complex,

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

are not used in the ﬁt, unless stated otherwise. The results for vari-
ous sub-MCh and near-MCh models are summarised in Table 7 and
illustrated in Figure 8.

Assuming the metal production from SNcc to follow the cal-
culations of Nomoto et al. (2006) with Salpeter IMF and Solar
initial metallicity, the best-ﬁt to the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Cr/Fe,
Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe data points is given by a combination of the
N100 delayed detonation model for the near-MCh progenitors, and
the ‘1.1-0.9’ violent merger model for the sub-MCh explosion chan-
nel. The ﬁt describes the six considered data points well (with
a χ2 of 3.23 for 4 d.o.f and two free parameters) and suggests
fIa = 0.25 ± 0.06 (in agreement with results presented in the pre-
vious sections) and fch = 0.30 ± 0.14, i.e. about one third of SN Ia
progenitors are near-MCh. However, this model still suﬀers from the
same problems in reproducing the relative abundances of interme-
diate α-elements as the ‘classical’ models in the previous section.
In fact, because the total mass of the two white dwarfs involved
in the collision described by the ‘1.1-0.9’ model is relatively high,
a lot of unbound material undergoes incomplete burning, resulting
in a large amount of Si (and even the production of some lighter
elements from O to Mg, which are normally not expected to be
contributed by SN Ia in an appreciable quantity; see bottom left
panel of Figure 8). Hence, the Si/Ar ratio predicted by this model
is even higher, and in worse tension with the observations, than the
‘classical’ models discussed above. In the DDDDDD scenario, on
the other hand, only one of the WDs involved in the collision ex-
plodes, leaving the other one intact. The mass of unbound ejecta is
smaller, resulting in a smaller amount of light elements being pro-
duced. This leads to an overall better match to the observed Perseus
Cluster metal abundance pattern when all elements (including Si-
Ca) are considered. However, Si/Ar and Si/Ca are still higher than
the observed values (though the tension is less than when using
the N100+‘1.1-0.9’ model). In addition, the DDDDDD yields over
predict Cr, such that the goodness of ﬁt when considering only the
O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe data points is worse
than in the N100+‘1.1-0.9’ case.

Finally, we note that the best-ﬁt value of fch is sensitive to the
choice of near-MCh SN Ia model (while it seems to be robust to
the choice of sub-MCh model). Recent X-ray observations of the
supernova remnant 3C 397 indicated Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios much
higher than those predicted by typical near-MCh SN Ia models (Ya-
maguchi et al. 2015), suggesting that near-MCh white dwarfs might
have a higher central density than previously thought (Dave et al.
2017; Leung & Nomoto 2018). Using a higher density near-MCh
SN Ia model (‘500-1-c3-1’ from Leung & Nomoto 2018) as an
alternative to the N100 model, in combination with the ‘1.1-0.9’
sub-MCh model and the Nomoto et al. (2006) SNcc yields, we ob-
tain a lower fch = 0.13 ± 0.09. This combination of models how-
ever provides a worse ﬁt than the other two combinations described
above, both when considering only the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Cr/Fe,
Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe data points, and when extrapolating the model to
all Perseus measurements including Si,S,Ar,Ca.

4.2.4 The impact of diﬀerent SNcc model calculations

All combinations of SN Ia yields discussed above show the same
residuals in ﬁtting the intermediate α-elements from Si–Ca when
the SNcc yields are assumed to follow the model of Nomoto et al.
(2006). It is therefore possible that the diﬀerences between the ob-
served data and the models are due to remaining uncertainties in
SNcc nucleosynthesis calculations.

Recently, Sukhbold et al. (2016) presented an alternative set

Simionescu et al.

Figure 8. Results of ﬁtting a combination of near- and sub-MCh yield models for SN Ia, together with various assumptions for SNcc. All progenitor metallicities
are assumed to be Solar. For near-MCh SN Ia, we use the models N100 from Seitenzahl et al. (2013) and 500-1-c3-1 from Leung & Nomoto (2018); for sub-
MCh SN Ia, we test the calculations of Pakmor et al. (2012) (model ‘1.1-0.9’) and Shen et al. (2018) (labeled ‘DDDDDD’). For SNcc, models ‘SukN20’ and
‘SukW18’ are from Sukhbold et al. (2016), and ‘Nomoto’ from Nomoto et al. (2006). SNcc yields are integrated assuming a Salpeter IMF. In the top panel, we
compare the results of ﬁtting only the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios with various model combinations (the models were extrapolated to
predict the abundances of intermediate elements from Si to Ca). The blue band illustrates the eﬀects of varying fIa and fch within their allowed 1σ conﬁdence
interval. In the bottom panels, bars of diﬀerent colours show the contribution from various SN types to the enrichment model for two particular cases: on the
left, the combination that gives the best description of the Fe-group abundances; on the right, the combination that gives the best description of all abundance
ratios, including intermediate elements. For the latter case only (the bottom right plot), all abundance measurements were used to constrain the best-ﬁt model
parameters.

of SNcc nucleosynthesis calculations taking into account neutrino
transport. The models presented by Sukhbold et al. (2016) were
calibrated by adjusting the model parameters such that, when the
explosion engine is applied to a progenitor known to roughly match
that of SN 1987A, the resulting energy and nickel mass also agree
with the observational constraints for that event. With the parame-
ters determined in this way, the explosion model is then applied to
a suite of Solar-metallicity progenitors with a wide range of masses
from 9 to 120 M(cid:12) evolved from the main sequence. This calibration
leads to diﬀerent results depending on the exact progenitor model
assumed for SN 1987A; here we focus on two choices, namely the
N20 and W18 progenitor models.

N20 is a historical model wherein a main-sequence star of
21.0 M(cid:12) evolves into a red-supergiant, undergoes mass loss to be-
come a 16.3 M(cid:12) star, and then transforms into a blue-supergiant
as a result of extra artiﬁcial dredge-up of He into the envelope
(Saio et al. 1988). The star forms a 6.0 M(cid:12) He core, so that the
luminosity and radius are consistent with the observed progenitor
of SN 1987A. The evolution of the 6.0 M(cid:12) He core is calculated
separately through the early collapse of the Fe core (Nomoto &
Hashimoto 1988). The explosion model of the 16.3 M(cid:12) star sat-
isﬁes the observational constraints on the SN 1987A explosion

(Shigeyama & Nomoto 1990). Model W18 on the other hand is
based on an 18 M(cid:12) star that is evolved intact from the main se-
quence; the assumed high rotation leads to mixing of He into the
envelope, such that the star develops into a blue supergiant resem-
bling the progenitor of SN 1987A; however, this evolution leads
to a larger He core than suggested by the SN 1987A explosion
(Utrobin et al. 2015).

We have assumed a Salpeter IMF to compute the average of
the mass-dependent yields reported by Sukhbold et al. (2016), cal-
ibrated either to a W18 or N20 progenitor. The contribution from
both the explosion and pre-SN winds is included. The results are
shown in Table 7 and Figure 8. Both the W18 and N20 models pro-
duce signiﬁcantly more O, and a higher O/Mg ratio, than the yields
of Nomoto et al. (2006); as a result, in order to reproduce the O/Fe,
Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe measurements in the core of the Perseus Clus-
ter, the contribution from SNcc assuming the Sukhbold et al. (2016)
yields must be reduced, i.e. the best-ﬁt fIa ∼ 35±6% is signiﬁcantly
higher than when using the SNcc yields of Nomoto et al. (2006).
The N20 and W18 models provide a better ﬁt to the Si/Ar and Si/Ca
ratios compared to the SNcc model of Nomoto et al. (2006), when
mixed with a given combination of SN Ia products. However, the

W18 model overproduces S by a very large factor and is hence dis-
favoured by the data.

Fitting all metal abundance ratios measured with the
SXS/RGS with a combination of the Sukhbold et al. (2016) N20
yields, averaged over a Salpeter IMF, the N100 yields for near-MCh
SN Ia, and DDDDDD yields for sub-MCh SN Ia, gives an accept-
able goodness of ﬁt, with a χ2 of 15.73 for 8 d.o.f. and fIa = 38±6%.
This ﬁt does not require a signiﬁcant contribution from near-MCh
SN Ia, with fch spanning allowed values between 0 and 20%. We
note however that the Mn/Fe ratio is not reproduced well, and that
when intermediate elements from Si to Ca are excluded from the ﬁt,
the best χ2 is obtained by combining the Nomoto et al. (2006) SNcc
yields with the N100 and ‘1.1-0.9’ models for SN Ia (see previous
subsection).

Therefore, no single combination of the models considered
above clearly stands out as the best solution for explaining the
metal abundance ratios observed in the core of the Perseus Clus-
ter. Although mixing the Nomoto et al. (2006) SNcc yields for
a Solar progenitor metallicity with the Leung & Nomoto (2018)
delayed detonation near-MCh SN Ia model for zero metal abun-
dance of the progenitor gives a formally acceptable ﬁt, the dis-
crepancy required between the SNcc and SNIa progenitor compo-
sitions makes this unlikely to be a physically reasonable model.
If we require the SNcc and SNIa progenitors to have the same
metal abundance, the Sukhbold et al. (2016) N20 yields for SNcc,
together with the “dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-
detonation” sub-MCh SN Ia model, are preferred in order to repro-
duce the relative abundances of intermediate α-elements, while the
Nomoto et al. (2006) SNcc yields, together with the N100 and ‘1.1-
0.9’ models for near- and sub-MCh SN Ia, provide the best match to
the Fe-group elements. In addition, the lowest χ2 value obtained as-
suming SNcc and SNIa progenitors to have the same initial metal-
licity (15.73 for 8 d.o.f.) is still much worse than the simple as-
sumption that all ratios are equal to Solar (χ2 = 10.7 for 10 d.o.f.
and no free parameters).

In reality, it is likely that the picture is even more complex:
Type Iax supernovae (Jha 2017), as well as Ca-rich gap transients
(Waldman et al. 2011), may still contribute to the enrichment.
Given the uncertainties associated with current SN yields, it is dif-
ﬁcult to quantify the contribution from these additional processes
at this time. The fact that linear combinations of sets of SN Ia and
SNcc models do not reproduce the observed abundances well may
also be partly due to a failure in one of the implicit assumptions
underlying the linear combination model. This relatively simple ap-
proximation of the enrichment assumes that a few classes of super-
novae dominate the chemical enrichment, while in reality it may
have taken several generations of stars with many diﬀerent con-
ﬁgurations to form the currently observed (Universal) abundance
pattern in the ﬁrst few billion years after the Big Bang.

Implications for metal abundance studies using X-ray
CCDs

The exquisite multi-observatory data available for the core of the
Perseus Cluster allows us to perform a detailed comparison of the
chemical abundance pattern measured using various detectors and
ﬁtting techniques. While ZNpaper discussed the diﬀerences be-
tween previously published studies using CCD data and the Hit-
omi results, here we have ensured that the archival observations
are reprocessed such that the exact same spatial region and version
of the atomic line emission data base is used, in order to provide
the most direct comparison possible. Although any systematic un-

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

certainties identiﬁed for this system may not be representative for
spectra of other galaxy clusters with diﬀerent redshifts and ther-
mal structures, we hope that these results provide a useful gauge
of the residual calibration errors associated with X-ray CCD spec-
troscopy. This is particularly relevant in this context, since biased
abundance ratio measurements from previously utilised CCD data
may result in incorrect constraints on SNIa and/or SNcc yield mod-
els (see Section 4.2). In the top panel of Figure 9, we show the dif-
ferences between the metal abundance ratios measured with Suzaku
XIS, XMM-Newton EPIC, and the higher spectral resolution Hitomi
SXS and XMM-Newton RGS. For the CCD measurements, the re-
sults of both ‘local’ and ‘global’ ﬁts are compared, and described
in more detail below.

• The Fe/H abundances obtained with EPIC/MOS and
Suzaku/XIS are in good agreement with the Hitomi SXS result
(within about 5%), while EPIC/pn and XMM-Newton/RGS give
signiﬁcantly lower Fe/H values. This is a known issue with RGS
analysis that should not have a large impact on the relative abun-
dance ratios with respect to Fe (see Section 3.3). For EPIC/pn, how-
ever, it is less clear how the best-ﬁt metal abundance ratios are af-
fected by this systematic diﬀerence in the absolute Fe abundance
(which is about 20% lower than the SXS measurement).

• There is a large spread in the best-ﬁt O/Fe values. The Suzaku
XIS gives larger values of O/Fe than XMM-Newton EPIC, regard-
less of whether a ‘global’ or ‘local’ ﬁt method is used for Suzaku
(for EPIC, only ‘local’ ﬁt results are reported, since a global ﬁt
was not performed independently for MOS and pn for this ele-
ment). The RGS value falls between the XIS and EPIC measure-
ments. Both the O emission line and the O absorption edge from
the Galactic foreground, as well as the contamination layer cali-
bration of Suzaku, can contribute to these systematic diﬀerences.
Figure 5 shows very broad residuals around the O line in Perseus
for the XIS, illustrating the diﬃculty of obtaining a reliable best-ﬁt
value. Additionally, AtomDB results predict a systematically larger
O/Fe compared to SPEXACT.

• The Ne abundance is uncertain since the strongest lines from
this element are blended with the Fe-L complex, preventing ‘local’
ﬁtting methods from being applied. As for O, AtomDB ﬁts give a
larger Ne/Fe compared to SPEXACT. For a given assumption of
the atomic data base, Suzaku measurements of Ne/Fe lie within the
(relatively large) statistical conﬁdence interval of the corresponding
RGS measurements. For XMM-Newton EPIC, the Ne/Fe ratio in the
global ﬁts was ﬁxed to that obtained from RGS and is not reported.
• The Mg/Fe abundance ratios measured with Suzaku XIS and
EPIC/MOS are in good agreement with XMM-Newton RGS, while
EPIC/pn underestimates the Mg/Fe value.

• The Si/Fe ratio obtained from nearly all CCD measurements
is at the upper end of the conﬁdence interval of the Hitomi SXS
result, except the ‘global’ EPIC/pn value that is lower and in better
agreement with the SXS. In practice, given that the absolute Fe
abundance measured with EPIC/pn is signiﬁcantly lower than with
the SXS (by about 20%), this means that the absolute Si abundance
is underestimated by the EPIC/pn global ﬁt and overestimated by
other methods, compared to the SXS. We caution however that,
due to the eﬀective area attenuation by the closed gate valve, the Si
abundance is the most prone to systematic uncertainties among the
elements detected by Hitomi.

• there are statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the ‘lo-
cal’ and ‘global’ ﬁt results for S using both EPIC detectors and
for Ar using EPIC/MOS. The ‘global’ best-ﬁt values are typically
lower than the ‘local’ values; the SXS measurements for S/Fe and

Newton EPIC for both ‘local’ and ‘global’ ﬁts. For the ‘global’ ﬁts, absolute Fe/H measurements are also compared. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the
legend, the ﬁt was performed using SPEXACT v3.03.00. The data points are based on the values shown in Table 5. The conﬁdence interval obtained using the
higher spectral resolution SXS and RGS data is shown as a grey band. Bottom: the average relative bias of CCD results (calculated as the diﬀerence between
the CCD results and the SXS/RGS mean value, divided by the SXS/RGS mean value). Black squares are obtained by averaging the results of global ﬁts to
the CCD data (using only SPEXACT in order not to count the XIS results twice). Blue circles show the average of the local ﬁts, weighted by their respective
statistical errors. Error bars represent the standard deviation between XIS, MOS, and pn in each case. The grey band represents the conﬁdence interval of the
RGS/SXS measurements. The horizontal lines show no bias (solid black), ±15% bias (dotted red), and +40% bias (dotted black).

Ar/Fe lie between the EPIC/MOS ‘local’ and ‘global’ results, and
are in agreement with the EPIC/pn ‘global’ ﬁts. The Suzaku XIS
results for these elements are more stable with respect to diﬀer-
ences between the ‘global’ and ‘local’ ﬁts compared to the EPIC
measurements. The S/Fe ratio measured by Suzaku is within the
SXS conﬁdence interval, while Ar/Fe is overpredicted by the XIS
results.

• The XIS measurements of Ca/Fe are in relatively good agree-
ment with the Hitomi results, while all estimates of Ca/Fe from
XMM-Newton overestimate this ratio. This systematic uncertainty
may at least in part be responsible for previous claims that Ca-rich
gap transient contributions and/or alternative SNIa yield models
were required to explain the metal enrichment pattern in the ICM
(all papers discussing this eﬀect were based on XMM-Newton data;
see de Plaa et al. 2007; Mernier et al. 2016b). We note however that,
even though the Ca/Fe ratio obtained with the SXS is lower than
XMM-Newton it remains diﬃcult for many choices of “classic” su-
pernova models to produce enough Ca to match the observations
(see Section 4.2).

• For both Cr/Fe and Ni/Fe, the best-ﬁt ‘local’ XIS value is in
worse agreement with the SXS than the ‘global’ ﬁt. The ‘local’
MOS value of Cr/Fe is in agreement with the Hitomi result, while

Cr is not detected signiﬁcantly in the EPIC/pn ‘global’ ﬁts. Both
the ‘local’ and ‘global’ Cr/Fe measurements obtained with XIS, as
well as the ‘global’ EPIC results, are higher than the Hitomi value.
• Mn/Fe ratios are overestimated by all detectors and all ﬁtting
methods, with the possible exception of the ‘local’ EPIC/pn result
(the latter having large statistical uncertainties). The large discrep-
ancy between atomic codes for the XIS-derived ‘global’ Mn/Fe
values is somewhat mitigated by using ‘local’ ﬁts, which signiﬁ-
cantly decrease the Mn/Fe value measured with SPEXACT, while
the ‘local ﬁtting’ AtomDB result (Mn/Fe=1.43 ± 0.20, not plotted
in Figure 9) remains the same as the ‘global’ value. In addition, at
medium spectral resolution, the Mn lines may blend with Fe XXII
– Fe XXIV innershell transitions, known to be quite uncertain and
to diﬀer in strength between AtomDB and SPEXACT, contributing
to the large uncertainty in the Mn measurement.

• The Ni/Fe abundances obtained with both EPIC/pn and
EPIC/MOS ‘local’ ﬁts are in good agreement with the Hitomi re-
sults, while the XIS ‘global’ ﬁts slightly underestimate, and the
‘local’ ﬁt overestimates the SXS measurement. Leaving both Ni
and Fe to vary freely in the ‘local’ XIS ﬁt (i.e. using only the He-
β Fe line to measure the Fe abundance) on the other hand gives
Ni/Fe=0.80 ± 0.06, this time consistent with the Hitomi value. In

any case we note that, employing the latest updates to the emis-
sion line data bases in AtomDB and SPEXACT, the high values of
Ni/Fe reported by several previous studies of metal enrichment in
the ICM (Dupke & White 2000; Mernier et al. 2016a) are no longer
favoured.

• Except for O, Ne and Mn, abundances obtained with AtomDB

and SPEXACT are in good agreement.

It seems therefore that all choices of detector (XIS, MOS or
pn) and ﬁtting methodology (‘local’ or ‘global’) yield the ‘correct’
result in the case of some elements, but fail to match the high-
resolution spectroscopy results for other abundance ratios. Small
residual ‘wiggles’ in the eﬀective area calibration present at var-
ious energies for diﬀerent CCD instruments aﬀect the results for
that respective detector (see inset of Figure 5). Allowing the over-
all normalisation in a narrow energy band to be free in the ﬁt can
only shift the continuum level up or down, but not correct for any
‘curvature’ uncertainty in the eﬀective area calibration (i.e. the con-
tinuum is too high on one side of the line but too low on the other),
which is perhaps why ‘local’ ﬁts do not necessarily provide a better
agreement with the micro-calorimeter data than ‘global’ ﬁts.

To further quantify the average biases associated with CCD
spectroscopy, we have also computed the mean and standard devi-
ation of the results obtained with the diﬀerent detectors considered
here. In order not to count the XIS data set twice, we only use the
SPEXACT results for this calculation (as noted above, for all abun-
dances measured by the SXS, except Mn, SPEXACT and AtomDB
agree very well; for Mn/Fe, the AtomDB measurement with XIS
falls well within the spread in results obtained with SPEXACT
for the various CCD detectors considered here). We compute the
average values separately for the ‘global’ and ‘local’ ﬁts. For the
‘global’ ﬁts, the statistical error bars are formally very small, and
systematic errors clearly dominate; hence, we have computed a
simple mean value and standard deviation for the MOS, pn, and
XIS measurements. The ‘local’ ﬁts typically provide an acceptable
description of the limited energy band in question (i.e. a reasonable
goodness-of-ﬁt); hence, the statistical errors in this case (denoted
σstat) can be considered as more reliable, and we have computed
the average of the MOS, pn, and XIS measurements weighted by
stat. The upper limit on Cr/Fe from the pn local ﬁt is not used
1/σ2
in the calculation. The results are shown in the bottom panel of
Figure 9, where we plot the average relative bias (diﬀerence be-
tween the mean CCD and RGS/SXS measurement, divided by the
RGS/SXS result) and standard deviation of the abundance ratios
measured with lower-resolution spectra.

Within the scatter among various CCD detectors, the mean
O/Fe and Mg/Fe ratios agree well with the current RGS constraints.
Taking the average value between XMM-Newton and Suzaku re-
sults, the ‘global’ Fe/H, Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios are
recovered within 15% of the Hitomi SXS value, and within the
uncertainty range of the SXS measurements; Ca/Fe and Cr/Fe are
overestimated by 40% (for Ca, this could be corrected by using only
the XIS result, which agrees with the SXS value), while Mn/Fe is
overestimated by a large factor (200%). ‘Local’ ﬁts help to reduce
the Mn/Fe bias, but the measurement of this abundance ratio is still
80% higher than the Hitomi measurement. ‘Local’ and ‘global’ av-
erages are generally in agreement, although the ‘local’ ﬁts perform
slightly worse for Ar/Fe and Ni/Fe and slightly better for Ca/Fe
compared to ‘global’ ﬁts.

Hence, the systematic limit is quite quickly reached for abun-
dance measurements using X-ray CCD spectroscopy of clusters. It
is nevertheless quite remarkable that we are able to measure the

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

abundance of most of the elements well within 40% with a low-
resolution X-ray spectrometer in an object at a distance of ∼70
Mpc, compared to methods in other wavebands. The SXS instru-
ment aboard Hitomi has shown that high-resolution X-ray spec-
troscopy can help us reduce the systematic uncertainty budget sub-
stantially, and even improve the results from CCD spectrometers
by making spectral models more accurate. In particular, the Ni/Fe
measurements from CCD spectroscopy are now in better agreement
with the SXS results largely because Hitomi allowed us to measure
and update the emissivity of several Fe lines that appeared blended
with Ni at lower spectral resolution.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have combined the latest results obtained with the high spec-
tral resolution X-ray micro-calorimeter onboard the Hitomi satel-
lite, together with archival data, in order to perform an in-depth
study of the chemical enrichment pattern in the diﬀuse intra-cluster
medium at the core of the Perseus cluster of galaxies. Our results
can be summarised as follows:

• taking both statistical and systematic uncertainties into ac-
count, the Hitomi SXS provides tight constraints on the abundances
of 8 diﬀerent chemical elements: Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni.
The total uncertainty budget amounts to ∼10% for the absolute Fe
abundance as well as for S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Ni/Fe, ∼15% for Si/Fe
and Cr/Fe, and ∼20% for Mn/Fe.

• no lines from elements other than those listed in the previous
point were detected with high conﬁdence, although hints of Al Ly
β, a blend of Cl Ly α and K He α, and Ti He α are seen with a sig-
niﬁcance between 1 − 2σ. Within the large statistical uncertainties,
the abundances of these elements with respect to Fe are consistent
with the Solar ratios.

• while the absolute abundance (i.e., Fe/H) decreases by about
30% with increasing radius, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant spatial variations
in the relative abundance ratios of other detected elements with re-
spect to Fe over the area probed by the Hitomi SXS (extending from
the AGN in the BCG out to about 100 kpc).

• emission lines from lighter elements like O, Ne, and Mg fall
outside of the limited bandpass of the available SXS observations;
currently, the best constraints on their relative abundances with re-
spect to Fe are obtained from the XMM-Newton RGS, with typical
estimated uncertainties of ∼20–30%.

• both the RGS and SXS measurements of the chemical enrich-
ment pattern in the core of the Perseus Cluster are remarkably con-
sistent with the abundance ratios (relative to Fe) measured in the
proto-solar nebula (Lodders et al. 2009), in low-mass early type
galaxies (Conroy et al. 2014), and in optical and infrared studies
of other typical Milky Way stars with near-solar absolute metallic-
ity (Bensby et al. 2014; Battistini & Bensby 2015; Hawkins et al.
2016). The simple assumption that all abundance ratios are equal
to Solar gives an excellent description of the Perseus Cluster ICM,
with χ2 = 10.7 for 10 d.o.f. and no free parameters.

Furthermore, we have compared in detail the metal abundance
ratios measured using high-resolution spectra (RGS and SXS) with
those obtained from the XMM-Newton EPIC and Suzaku XIS de-
tectors for the same sky region, employing the latest updates to the
atomic line emission data bases. We conclude that:

• there is a signiﬁcant scatter among the results from CCD spec-
tra; for each element, at least one choice of detector (XIS, MOS or
pn) and ﬁtting technique (‘local’ or ‘global’, i.e. using narrow-band

20

or broad-band energy ranges) matches the high-resolution spec-
troscopy result, but no single method and instrument stand out as
being systematically more accurate over all.

• averaging the broadband results from the three diﬀerent CCD-
type instruments considered here, we ﬁnd that the Fe/H, Si/Fe,
S/Fe, Ar/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios for the core of the Perseus Cluster are
recovered within the uncertainty range of the SXS measurements,
while Ca/Fe and Cr/Fe are biased high by ∼ 40% in the lower reso-
lution spectra (with the Ca bias driven primarily by XMM-Newton,
while XIS and SXS values agree). The largest bias is found for
Mn/Fe, where the average value derived from CCD spectroscopy is
larger by a factor of 2–3 compared to the Hitomi measurement.

We caution the reader, however, that a conclusive study of the level
of systematic errors associated with abundance ratio measurements
from X-ray CCDs would require high-spectral resolution observa-
tions of a larger sample of clusters spanning a range of average
temperatures and redshifts.

As the ICM in clusters of galaxies incorporates the accumu-
lated ejecta from billions of type Ia and core-collapse supernova
explosions, the exact metal abundance pattern can be used to con-
strain the ratio of SN Ia to SNcc contributing to the enrichment,
as well as the exact details of the supernova explosion mechanisms
and progenitors. Previous studies in this respect focused primarily
on XMM-Newton (and, to a lesser extent, Suzaku) measurements,
which suﬀer from the systematic uncertainties discussed above. We
have conducted a detailed analysis to assess how well current super-
nova yield calculations are able to reproduce the abundance pattern
observed in the ICM, based on the most reliable high-resolution
spectroscopy constraints available for the core of the Perseus Clus-
ter. We ﬁnd that:

• the ‘classical’ SN Ia yields of Iwamoto et al. (1999) have been
updated recently by Nomoto & Leung (2018) to include the latest
electron capture and nuclear reaction rates, resulting in a substan-
tially diﬀerent Ni/Fe production. Contrary to arguments published
in previous literature (e.g. Dupke & White 2000), slow deﬂagra-
tion models for SN Ia do not necessarily imply a highly super-solar
Ni/Fe in the ICM; the latest W7 model is currently preferred over
the updated 1D delayed detonation models, since the latter heav-
ily overproduce Cr/Fe compared to the observations. Nevertheless,
none of the ‘classical’ SN Ia yields can reproduce the relative abun-
dances of Fe-group elements satisfactorily.

• mixing the Nomoto et al. (2006) SNcc yields for a Solar pro-
genitor metallicity with the Leung & Nomoto (2018) 2D delayed
detonation near-MCh SN Ia model for zero metal abundance of the
progenitor yields a formally acceptable ﬁt, although requiring such
a large discrepancy between the SNcc and SNIa progenitor compo-
sitions seems unphysical.

• assuming the SNcc and SNIa progenitors to have the same
initial metal abundance, the model that best reproduces both the
light α-element (O, Ne, Mg) and Fe-group element (Cr, Mn, Fe)
ratios with respect to Fe is given by combining the SNcc yields of
Nomoto et al. (2006) together with the N100 delayed detonation
plus the ‘1.1-0.9’ violent merger for the near- and sub-MCh explo-
sion channels, respectively (Seitenzahl et al. 2013; Pakmor et al.
2012). This model suggests that SN Ia represent 25±6% of the total
number of supernovae, and near-MCh SN Ia represent 30 ± 14% of
the total number of SN Ia. However, this model does not reproduce
the relative abundances of intermediate α-elements, in particular
over-predicting the Si/Ar and Si/Ca ratios.

• a mixture of the ‘N20’ SNcc model of Sukhbold et al.
(2016), the N100 model for near-MCh SN Ia, and a recently pub-

lished ‘dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation’
scenario for sub-MCh SN Ia (Shen et al. 2018) provides a better
agreement with the measured Si/Ar and Si/Ca ratio, although S/Si
is overproduced. This model suggests a SN Ia fraction of 38 ± 6%,
with up to 20% of SN Ia progenitors being near-MCh. Due to the
lower best-ﬁt fraction of near-MCh SN Ia, this model on the other
hand underproduces Mn/Fe; hence, currently, a better ﬁt to the α-
element to Fe ratios comes at the expense of obtaining a worse
description of the Fe-group to Fe composition.

• the Hitomi SXS provides much tighter constraints on the abun-
dance of Ar than stellar spectra or even measurements of the proto-
solar composition. The precise measurements of Si/Ar and S/Ar
enabled by Hitomi can be used to reﬁne future core-collapse su-
pernova yields. In particular, it seems that including the eﬀects of
neutrino transport in the SNcc yield calculation of Sukhbold et al.
(2016) can, in some model variants, reproduce the relative abun-
dances of various intermediate α-elements better than the Nomoto
et al. (2006) yields that do not account for these eﬀects.

Our results demonstrate the power of high-resolution X-ray
spectroscopy in determining the origin of various chemical ele-
ments in the Universe. Future progress in this ﬁeld will rely both on
obtaining precise measurements of the metal abundance pattern in
a larger sample of clusters of galaxies using high-resolution spec-
trometers on upcoming X-ray missions such as XRISM-Resolve
(Tashiro et al. 2018) and Athena X-IFU (Barret et al. 2018), but
also on improvements in our theoretical models of supernova nu-
cleosynthesis.
