ABSTRACT

A well-known precursor of an imminent solar eruption is the appearance of a hot
S-shaped loop, also known as sigmoid, in an active region (AR). Classically, the forma-
tion of such an S-shaped loop is envisaged to be implemented by magnetic reconnec-
tion of two oppositely oriented J-shaped loops. However, the details of reconnection
are elusive due to weak emission and subtle evolution during the pre-eruptive phase.
In this paper, we investigate how a single J-shaped loop transforms into an S-shaped
one through the slippage of one of its footpoints in NOAA AR 11719 on 2013 April
11. During an interval of about 16 min, the J-shaped loop slips through a low-corona
region of strong electric current density in a bursty fashion, reaching a peak apparent
speed as fast as over 1000 km s−1 at the slipping footpoint. The enhancement of
electric current density, as suggested by non-linear force-free ﬁeld modeling, indicates
that the “non-idealness” of coronal plasma becomes locally important, which may
facilitate magnetic reconnection. The loop segment undergoing slipping motions is
heated; meanwhile, above the ﬁxed footpoint coronal emission dims due to a combina-
tion eﬀect of the lengthening and heating of the loop, the latter of which is manifested
in the temporal variation of dimming slope and of emission measure. These features
together support an asymmetric scenario of sigmoid formation through slipping re-
connection of a single J-shaped loop, which diﬀers from the standard tether-cutting
scenario involving a double J-shaped loop system.

1. INTRODUCTION

Composed of a group of coherently twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines, magnetic ﬂux ropes
are an important structure in many models that have illuminated the key physics
of solar eruptions (see the recent reviews by Liu 2020; Patsourakos et al. 2020, and
references therein). However, the actual processes leading to the formation of mag-
netic ﬂux ropes and the subsequent onset of eruptions remain elusive. A ﬂux rope
may form in the convection zone and then emerge through the photosphere into the
corona (Fan & Gibson 2003; Cheung & Isobe 2014). The emerging process, how-
ever, can be severely hampered by heavy plasma trapped at the bottom of the rope.
Alternatively, a ﬂux rope may form in the corona via the so-called ‘tether cutting’
reconnection (Moore & Labonte 1980; Moore et al. 2001). This process can be driven
by photospheric shearing and converging ﬂows around the polarity inversion line (PIL;
van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989); consequently, magnetic shear increases near the
PIL, which is often manifested as the presence of a pair of opposing J-shaped loops.
Through magnetic reconnection between their inner legs, the double J-shaped loops
are converted into a longer twisted ﬂux rope and a shorter loop that consequently sub-
merges, exhibiting ﬂux cancellation in the photosphere (van Ballegooijen & Martens
1989; Green & Kliem 2009).

The tether-cutting scenario was motivated by the evolution of an S-shaped fea-
ture known as ‘sigmoid’, observed in soft X-rays (SXRs) or extreme-ultraviolet
(EUV). Soon after being discovered by the Soft X-Ray Telescope on-board Yohkoh
(Sakurai et al. 1992), sigmoids are recognized as an important CME progenitor
(Canﬁeld et al. 1999). Despite the low time cadence, Yohkoh images demonstrate
the sigmoid-to-arcade transformation (Sterling et al. 2000; Moore et al. 2001), i.e.,
a double J-shaped loop bundle is observed before eruptions whereas a cusp-shaped
ﬂare loop or arcade in the wake of eruptions. With high-cadence, high-resolution
SDO/AIA images, Liu et al. (2010) observed a complete transformation process from
a double-J-shaped loop bundle to a continuous S-shaped loop that subsequently de-
forms ceaselessly to an arc-shaped eruptive front. With a nonlinear-force-free ﬁeld
(NLFFF) model, Liu et al. (2013) traced magnetic ﬁeld lines from four brightening
kernels in AIA 1700 ˚A and found that the changes of magnetic-connectivity before
and after the ﬂare conform to the tether-cutting model.

It is natural to connect sigmoids with magnetic ﬂux ropes or highly sheared mag-
netic arcades, since the central section of a sigmoid is typically aligned with the pho-
tospheric PIL, indicating enhanced magnetic stresses and electric currents therein.
Rust & Kumar (1996) measured the aspect ratio (width to length) of 103 transient,
bright sigmoids in X-ray images taken by Yohkoh. They found that the peak dis-
tributed aspect ratio in observation is consistent with the one obtained from a kinked
ﬂux rope model. McKenzie & Canﬁeld (2008) reported a sigmoid lasting for about 3
days, comprising two separate J-shaped loop bundles. The persistence of the sigmoid

and the double-J conﬁguration provide strong support for the bald-patch separa-
trix surface model, and hence for the existence of a kinked ﬂux rope as argued by
Green & Kliem (2009). Sigmoids have since been considered as a proxy of magnetic
ﬂux ropes.

Built upon the two-dimensional (or 2.5-dimensional) ‘standard’ ﬂare model
(Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976), the
tether-cutting model still depicts a classical “cut-and-repaste” scenario. But in
reality, magnetic reconnection exhibits complex three-dimensional (3D) structures
(Priest & D´emoulin 1995; Priest et al. 2003; Pontin 2011). 3D reconnections take
place not just at topological separatrices and null points but in quasi-separatrix lay-
ers (QSL; D´emoulin 2006), where magnetic ﬁeld lines continually exchange magnetic
connectivities with neighboring lines, exhibiting ﬂipping or slipping motions of their
footpoints. Janvier et al. (2013) demonstrated through MHD simulations that the
temporal variation of slippage speed is strongly correlated with the spatial structure of
magnetic connectivity gradient, the latter of which can be quantiﬁed by the mapping
norm N (Priest & D´emoulin 1995) or squashing factor Q (Titov et al. 2002). Typi-
cally N and Q increase toward the center of QSLs, approaching inﬁnity at where sep-
aratrices or nulls are embedded (e.g., Liu et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2020). Many obser-
vational studies report slipping motions in SXRs and EUV (e.g., Aulanier et al. 2007;
Li & Zhang 2014; Dud´ık et al. 2014; Li & Zhang 2015; Dud´ık et al. 2016; Gou et al.
2016), with speeds ranging from several tens to slightly over one hundred kilometers
per second. The temporal variation of slippage speed, however, is diﬃcult to ob-
tain in observation, despite that it may provide a glimpse of magnetic structures in
reconnection regions.

In this paper, we investigate an EUV sigmoidal loop formed shortly before the ﬂare
onset. It evolves from a single J-shaped loop through footpoint slippage, rather than
from a double J-shaped loop system. The diﬀerence from the tether-cutting scenario
In the
may shed new light on the formation mechanism of magnetic ﬂux ropes.
remainder of the paper, we present the observations and data analysis in Section 2,
and discuss these results in Section 3.

2. OBSERVATION AND ANALYSIS

2.1. Instruments and Methods

In this study we use EUV images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA;
Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al.
2012) at a spatial scale of 0′′.6 pixel−1 and a cadence of 12 s. We focus on two hot
passbands (131 ˚A and 94 ˚A), in which the slippage of the coronal loop is visible. We
also use other AIA passbands, 335, 211, 193, and 171 ˚A, to study coronal dimming,
and the AIA 304 ˚A passband along with Hα images taken by the Kanzelh¨ohe Solar
Observatory (KSO) and by the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to exam-

ine the ﬁlament in the same AR. To diagnose the plasma temperature in the optically
thin corona, we employ an algorithm based on sparsity (Cheung et al. 2015; Su et al.
2018) to perform diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) inversions on coronal images
obtained by AIA’s six EUV passbands.

Photospheric magnetic ﬁeld is observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Hoeksema et al. 2014) on board SDO. We use HMI vector magnetograms (data
product hmi.sharp cea 720s) to extrapolate non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) with
an optimization approach (Wiegelmann 2004; Wiegelmann et al. 2012) and to de-
rive ﬂow ﬁeld by the Diﬀerential Aﬃne Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms
(DAVE4VM; Schuck 2008).

2.2. Overview

The eruption of interest is a GOES-class M6.5 two-ribbon ﬂare in NOAA AR 11719
(Figure 1(b)) on 2013 April 11, associated with a halo CME directed at the Earth.
The ﬂare started at 06:55 UT (Figure 2(b)) according to GOES 1–8 ˚A ﬂux. AR
11719 was featured by a large sunspot of negative polarity in the center, surrounded
by small spots and pores of mixed polarities (Figure 1(b)). To the south and east of
the large sunspot was a ﬁlament aligned along the PIL, with its southern branch half
circling the sunspot and the northern branch presenting a sinuous shape (Figure 1(a
& c)). Closely following the semicircular ﬁlament branch was a bright loop bundle,
clearly visible in relatively hot passbands, 131, 94, and 335 ˚A (e.g., Figure 1(e)). In
Hα images, the ﬁlament was long-lasting and remained stationary throughout the
eruption (Figure 3); however, the ﬁlament material was observed to ﬂow along the
loop when it was detached from the ﬁlament (§2.6). The semicircular loop bundle
was also stable prior to the eruption, but was obscured by post-ﬂare loops during the
eruption (see the animation accompanying Figure 1).

At 05:46 UT, over one hour before the ﬂare onset, the sinuous ﬁlament segment
brightened in EUV (e.g., Figure 1(c & d)), while the rest of the ﬁlament remained
dark. The brightening lasted for about 5 min. This observation indicates that the
sinuous segment was relatively independent of the rest of the ﬁlament. Apparently
crossing the sinuous ﬁlament segment from above, a J-shaped coronal loop became
visible at about 05:50 UT in 94 ˚A (Figure 1(e)) and 131 ˚A (not shown). From
06:28 to 06:46 UT, the western footpoint of the J-shaped loop, originally located
next to the eastern end of the semicircular ﬁlament (marked by ‘x’ symbols) slipped
through a curved trace around the major sunspot till near the western end of the
semicircular ﬁlament. Consequently, the single J-shaped loop was transformed into
an S-shaped structure (also referred to as sigmoid; Figure 1(f)) through the slipping
process. Starting from about 05:55 UT, a bundle of cusp-shaped loops rose slowly
and rotated into a helical shape, whose top section morphed into a diﬀuse blob at
about 06:25 UT, 3 minutes before the onset of the J-shaped loop’s slippage. The

blob of hot material then expanded and eventually erupted with the sigmoid (Figure
1(f) and accompanying animation). Vemareddy & Zhang (2014) studied the blob’s
evolution in detail and interpreted it as a kinked ﬂux rope.

2.3. Loop Slippage and Slipping Speed

At 06:26 UT, the J-shaped loop began to brighten in hot passbands, 131 and 94 ˚A.
Two minutes later, the western footpoint of the loop started to slip westward along
the PIL (Figure 4). The time range of the slipping process is marked with two red
dashed lines in Figure 2(b)-(d). Below, we took a series of steps to investigate the
evolution of the loop, especially of its slipping footpoint.

First, to enhance the visibility of the loop undergoing slipping motions, we paired
131 ˚A and 94 ˚A images that are closest in time stamp and added them in a ratio
that is optimized through trial and error. The running diﬀerence images of 131 ˚A
and 94 ˚A passbands are also combined in a similar fashion to highlight the slipping
motion. Then, we marked the loop in running diﬀerence images using ‘x’ symbols
(Figure 4), with the aid of the original images to locate the eastern section of the
loop that was relatively diﬀuse. During the early phase of the slippage, the western
section of the loop appeared to be attached to the sinuous ﬁlament segment (Figure
4(a–f)). But later, the loop was ‘torn’ oﬀ from the ﬁlament while the loop’s western
footpoint accelerated to slip away (Figure 4(g–l)). By contrast, the eastern section of
the loop was kept relatively ﬁxed. Finally, we calculated the slipping speed from the
western footpoint’s displacement observed in 14 time instants (only six of them are
plotted in Figure 4). The initial slipping speed was about 20 km s−1, then increased
to over 1000 km s−1, and ﬁnally slowed down when the slipping footpoint approached
the sunspot. The peak speed is at least one order of magnitude faster than those
reported in previous studies (e.g., Aulanier et al. 2007; Dud´ık et al. 2014; Li & Zhang
2014, 2015; Dud´ık et al. 2016).

To estimate the uncertainty in our pinpointing the slipping footpoint, we checked
the intensity variation across the footpoint. An example is shown in the inset of
Figure 4(j). We ﬁrst located the local maximum in the footpoint region. In practice,
this is done by enclosing the footpoint with a relatively large box (not shown) and
then searching for the pixel with maximum DN within the box. Centering around
this pixel, we obtained the averaged intensity over 5 pixels across the footpoint region
in the X- (light green) and Y -direction (dark green), respectively. The full width at
half maximum in the X- and Y -direction are shown by blue rectangles in Figure 4,
which indicate the double of measurement uncertainties adopted to derive the error
bars for slipping speeds (Figure 2(e)), following the propagation of uncertainties. In
some cases one can only determine half width at half maximum at one side, which is
then taken as the measurement uncertainty.

To understand the loop slippage in relation to the magnetic conﬁguration in AR
∇×B

11719, we calculated the current density in the reconstructed NLFFF by J = 1
µ0
under the magnetohydrodynamics assumption. Further, we integrated the absolute
value of current density within the height range of 2.9–47.4 Mm (or 4–65 pixel above
the surface in our NLFFF), i.e., from the top of the chromosphere extending up-
ward until about one hydrostatic scale height of the 1-MK corona (Aschwanden 2006,
Eq.(3.1.16)), to obtain the 2-D distribution of “column” current density in units of
A m−1 in the low corona (Figure 5(b)). We then superimposed the extracted posi-
tions of the slipping loop, which are color-coded by observed time, over the map of
column current densities. One can see that the trace of the slipping footpoint as
marked by asterisks mainly ran across the region with intense coronal current densi-
ties. As a sanity check, we found that in the selected height range current densities in
the region of interest signiﬁcantly exceed those in the background (represented by a
reference region of weak current densities; Figure 5(c)). It is remarkable that in pro-
jection photospheric regions with strong vertical current densities Jz (Figure 5(a)) can
be signiﬁcantly displaced from coronal regions with strong column current densities
(Figure 5(b)).

2.4. Asymmetric Heating

As a result of the slipping motion, a sigmoidal loop was produced (marked by
plus symbols in Figure 6) with temperatures as high as over log10 T [K] = 6.7. The
EM-weighted mean temperature (Figure 6(b)) was higher in the western part of the
sigmoidal loop than in the eastern part. One caveat is that the DEM analysis could
be compromised by the optically thick ﬁlament material (black solid curve in Figure
6(b)) that overlapped the sigmoidal loop along the line of sight, because the ﬁlament
material appeared in absorption in cold passbands but was obscured by brightening
structures in hot passbands. However, we noticed that the temperature enhancement
is also present along the loop segment with no ﬁlament material obstructing the line
of sight.

Further, we take the average of temperatures sampled at the extracted positions at
diﬀerent time instants (Figure 5(b)) from a eastern and western segment of the sig-
moidal loop, respectively; each segment roughly covers the curved end of the S-shaped
loop (yellow curves in Figure 6(a)). The average temperatures at both segments were
roughly equivalent and both increased gradually during the early slipping phase, but
at the western segment the temperature suddenly jumped from log T = 6.6 to 6.7
at 06:40 UT (Figure 2(f)), coinciding with the peak time of the slipping speed (Fig-
ure 2(e)). Hence we argued that the heating at the western, slipping section of the
sigmoidal loop is not a spurious eﬀect, but associated with the slipping process.

In comparison, we sampled the temperature of the blob from an 8′′ × 8′′ rectangle
in the center of the blob at 10 time instants. One can see that the blob was heated

Sigmoid Formation Through Loop Slippage

7

gradually during the slipping process (Figure 2(f)), and had a higher temperature
than the sigmoidal loop until the slipping speed peaked at about 06:40 UT, when
the western section of the sigmoidal loop was heated to a similar temperature. The
diﬀerent temperature-evolution proﬁles suggest that the blob and the sigmoidal loop
were most likely independent magnetic structures.

This inference can be further corroborated by investigating the evolution of the blob.
In the original and running diﬀerence images of AIA 131 and 94 ˚A passbands (see the
animation accompanying Figure 1), one can see a cusp-shaped loop bundle appeared
as early as 05:35 UT, almost one hour before the loops slippage, and later split into
two major bundles at about 06:00 UT, due to the slow rising and expanding of the
western bundle. It further rotated into a helical shape whose top section expanded
into the diﬀuse blob. The blob was anchored similarly as the cusp-shaped loop, with
one footpoint near the middle of the sinuous ﬁlament segment and the other in the
neighborhood of the western end of the semicircular ﬁlament segment.

2.5. Asymmetric Dimming

About 1 hour before the ﬂare onset, the area around the eastern footpoint of the
J-shaped loop system started to dim in both hot and cold passbands (Figure 7).
We acquired the evolution of dimming by taking the average intensity in one quasi-
elliptical area around the eastern footpoint. The obtained curves are plotted in Figure
2(c) in diﬀerent colors. One can see that the radiation from this area kept decreas-
ing during the pre-ﬂare phase, which is termed ‘pre-eruption dimming’. This phe-
nomenon has been reported in a few studies (Gopalswamy et al. 1999; Zhang et al.
2017; Qiu & Cheng 2017; Wang et al. 2019; Pan et al. 2021), in which dimming was
detected as early as 1 to 5 hours before a ﬂare/CME onset. It is generally explained
as density depletion due to the gradual expansion of the eruptive structure during its
slow rise.

Generally, the dimming depth and slope diﬀer among diﬀerent passbands. In our
case, we noticed that in 94, 335, and 211 ˚A the dimming slope changes greatly from
before to during the loop slippage. To quantify this, we obtained the average dimming
slope S from the slope of linear ﬁtting to the intensity lightcurves over the time interval
before (Spreslip) and during the loop slipping phase (Sslip). The ratio RS = Sslip/Spreslip
is given in Figure 2(c). The RS values are consistent with our impression that during
the slipping phase, the dimming slope is signiﬁcantly enhanced in 335 and 211 ˚A, but
depressed in 94 ˚A, compared with the pre-slipping phase. RS even turns negative in
94 ˚A because of a slight recovery in intensity during the slipping phase.

With the DEM analysis, we found that the EM of the dimming region exhibits a
complex temporal variation in its ‘hot bump’ at about log10 T [K] ∼ 6.85, which is the
formation temperature of the Fe XVIII emission line (λ = 93.93 ˚A) that dominates
the 94 ˚A passband (Figure 7; O’Dwyer et al. 2010). The variation indicates that

8

Pan et al.

the amount of hot mateiral at ∼ 6 MK decreases during the pre-slipping phase but
increases during the slipping phase. On the other hand, the temporal variation of the
‘warm bump’ at about log10 T [K] ∼ 6.4, which includes both Fe XVI (log10 T [K] =
6.45, λ = 335.41 ˚A) and Fe XIV (log10 T [K] = 6.3, λ = 211.32 ˚A) that dominates the
335 and 211 ˚A passband, respectively, indicates that the amount of warm material
at ∼ 2-3 MK keeps decreasing during the whole time interval of dimming. These are
consistent with the temporal variation of dimming slope among diﬀerent passbands,
especially for 94, 335, and 211 ˚A (Figure 2(c)).

Thus, we speculate that the dimming at the eastern footpoint of the sigmoidal
loop might be caused by the loop expansion during the pre-slipping phase, but by
a combination of the loop lengthening and heating during the slipping phase.
In
contrast to the eastern footpoint, no obvious dimming was seen around the western
footpoint during the whole time before the ﬂare.

2.6. Counter-Streaming Flow

Counter-streaming ﬂows were observed prior to the ﬂare onset, at speeds estimated
to be tens of kilometers per second, during a time interval between 06:41–06:49 UT
(marked by a shaded bar in Figure 2(b & c)), which coincides with the late phase
of slipping motions.
In Figure 8 we cut a strip from both original and running
diﬀerence images, rotate it to the vertical position, and marked a few episodes of
ﬂows discernible in the 304 and 131 ˚A passband by yellow and red arrows, respectively.
From the animation accompanying Figure 8, one can see multiple episodes of paired
ﬂows streaming away from where the J-shaped loop apparently crossed the ﬁlament.
The upward ﬂow is loaded onto, and moves eastward along, the loop, while the
downward ﬂow falls back to the surface.

We paid attention to the following observational features:

i) the ﬂows consist of
ﬁlament material that is preferentially visible in AIA 304 ˚A; ii) both upward and
downward ﬂows are released from the similar site and are nearly aligned, but one
is directed along the loop and the other along the ﬁlament; and iii) the draining
site of the downward ﬂow is close to the western footpoint of the original J-shaped
loop (plus symbol in Figure 8) but distinct from that of the full-ﬂedged sigmoidal
loop (asterisk symbol in Figure 8). The last feature, together with the fact that
the slipping motions start earlier and last more than two times longer than counter-
streaming ﬂows (Figure 2), suggests that the interaction of the loop’s eastern segment
with the ﬁlament is a separate process from the slippage of its western segment.

These observations indicate that the exchange of mass and magnetic connectivity
between the ﬁlament and the loop is associated with the release of oppositely directed
ﬂows. Thus, we interpreted the counter-streaming ﬂows as the outﬂows of magnetic
reconnection between the ﬁlament and the eastern segment of the sigmoidal loop.
The reconnection might have facilitated the loop’s splitting from the ﬁlament.

2.7. Evolution of the Source Region

Characterized by ﬂux cancellation (Figures 2(a) and 9(a-d)), the evolution of the
source region AR 11719, which is categorized as βγ according to the Mount Wilson
classiﬁcation, is typical of a decayed AR. The magnetic ﬂux in Figure 2(a) is obtained
from a rectangle (Figure 9(a)) enclosing the major sunspot pair in the AR, where the
slipping motions were mainly observed. The ﬂow ﬁeld calculated by DAVE4VM shows
that the two sunspots of opposite polarities both moved eastward, with a small con-
verging motion toward the PIL segment oriented in the southwest-northeast direction
(Figure 9(e)-(h)). As a result of the photospheric evolution, the column current den-
sity became increasingly strengthened and concentrated in the neighborhood of the
ﬂaring PIL within one day prior to the ﬂare (Figure 9(i–l)). The observed ﬂux cancel-
lation and converging motion in the hosting AR suggests that the photospheric condi-
tions that are favorable for tether-cutting reconnection (van Ballegooijen & Martens
1989; Green & Kliem 2009) may also work for the slipping reconnection.

3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

To summarize, we investigated the evolution of a J-shaped loop, focusing on the
slipping process of its western footpoint and its transformation into a sigmoid. Par-
tially aligned with the middle section of a ﬁlament, the J-shaped loop brightened and
its western footpoint slipped along the PIL above which the electric current density is
enhanced, leading to formation of a hot sigmoidal loop. Meanwhile, this “single-J to
S” transformation was accompanied by coronal dimming at the ﬁxed footpoint and
counter-streaming ﬂows along the loop.

3.1. Slipping Reconnection

The observation demonstrates that a sequence of slipping reconnection occurred
in a low-corona region with enhanced electric current density above the PIL. The
electric current density is related to the “nonidealness” R of plasma in terms of
Ohm’s law, i.e., R = E + v × B (Vasyliunas 1975). R is generally negligible in
the large-scale, low-β coronal plasma, but can become locally important, where the
steep gradients of magnetic ﬁeld are accompanied by large enhancements in electric
current density (Vasyliunas 1975) as well as in the squashing degree of elemental ﬂux
tubes (Titov et al. 2002; Boozer 2012; Janvier et al. 2013). Here we assume that such
regions are highly localized and remain unresolved by the telescope, considering that
the ion inertial length is on the order of 100 m in the coronal environment. However,
any “microscopic” slippage of plasma relative to the magnetic ﬁeld inside these regions
would be exponentially ampliﬁed (Boozer 2012), due to large squashing factors, into
“macroscopic” loop motions outside, where the force-free assumption remains valid
for the coronal plasma. Therefore, we argue that the observed coronal loops are
largely aligned along the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, despite their visibility depending on

10

Pan et al.

plasma temperature and density; hence their motions must represent the change of
magnetic conﬁguration.

The apparent ‘footpoints’ of coronal loops may be slightly diﬀerent from where they
are truly anchored in the dense chromosphere or photosphere, but they are least af-
fected by the projection eﬀect. Hence, tracking the footpoint motions is useful in
diagnosing the reconnection rate in the diﬀusion region, especially within the frame-
work of the standard 2D ﬂare model (Qiu et al. 2002). In 3D scenarios, that ﬁeld-line
footpoints slip at a sub- or super-Alfv´enic speed is termed slipping or slip-running re-
connection (Aulanier et al. 2006). In observational studies, slipping speeds reported
in the literature so far are below the acoustic speed in the corona (Aulanier et al.
2007; Dud´ık et al. 2014; Li & Zhang 2014, 2015; Dud´ık et al. 2016). In the present
event, the peak slippage speed is as fast as over 1000 km s−1, which is comparable
with the typical Alfv´enic speed in the corona. This is the fastest speed ever recorded,
probably falling in the slip-running regime.

Once the slippage of plasma relative to the magnetic ﬁeld is triggered, it would
produce an electric ﬁeld in the reference frame moving with the plasma, which further
enhances the nonidealness R.
If the increase in R, especially the parallel electric
ﬁeld Ek (Schindler et al. 1988), can help accelerate the slippage, a runaway process
would ensue, which might be the case here, as evidenced by the rapid increase in the
apparent slipping speed at about 06:40 UT (Figure 2(e)). However, the runaway is
not expect to last after the loop slips out of the region of strong current densities, as
also suggested by our observation (Figure 5).

3.2. J-to-S Transformation

This event presented several asymmetric features during the transformation from
the single J-shaped loop to sigmoid through slipping reconnection. We note that such
asymmetric features are not expected nor observed during the transformation from
a double J-shaped loop to a sigmoid through tether-cutting reconnection. Coronal
dimming was clearly detected around the eastern footpoint, which was relatively sta-
tionary, but not quite visible at the western fooptoint undergoing slipping motions,
even after the slipping speed had already slowed down. This suggests that the tempo-
ral scale for the development of coronal dimming is much longer than that of slipping
motions. The asymmetric temperature distribution along the fully ﬂedged S-shaped
loop, with its western segment signiﬁcantly hotter than the eastern one (Figure 6(b),
2(f)), resulted most likely from an accumulative eﬀect of the loop segment undergoing
slipping motions being heated up on the way. The slipping reconnection obviously
proceeded episodically, as evidenced by the bursty proﬁle of the slipping speed (Fig-
ure 2(e)), in the ∼ 16 min interval during which slipping motions were observed.
Hence the temporal scale for slipping reconnection heating must be much smaller

than that for plasma cooling, the latter of which is typically on the order of tens of
minutes in ﬂare plasmas (e.g., Chen et al. 2020, their Fig.6).

The “single-J to S” transformation through slipping reconnection distinguishes it-
self from the “double-J to S” transformation through tether-cutting reconnection.
Tether-cutting reconnection is so dubbed because it reduces the original four foot-
points of the double J-shaped loop to the two footpoints of the S-shaped loop. In
a mechanical analogy, the ﬁeld lines that provide the downward tension are analo-
gous to ground-anchored tethers that hold down a buoyant balloon. In contrast, the
slipping reconnection did not ‘cut’ any tethers but continually changed where the
J-shaped loop was anchored by shifting one of its footpoints. One might misidentify
the semicircular loop in the southwest as the other J-shaped loop in the prototypical
picture of the double-J to S transformation. In fact, the semicircular loop was distinct
from the loop under slipping motions (Figure 4), although they appear to share the
western footpoint by the end of the slipping phase. Further, the semicircular loop
remained nearly stationary throughout the J-to-S transformation as well as when the
sigmoidal loop started to rise upward to erupt (Figure 10), which argues against the
involvement of the semicircular loop in the formation of the sigmoid; nor there existed
any brightening compact loop straddling the PIL (cf. Figure 4), which argues against
the involvement of the standard tether-cutting reconnection in this transient J-to-S
transformation.

3.3. Structural Complexity

In addition to the high dynamic complexity, our investigation demonstrates high
structural complexity in this active region. It may possess a “triple decker” struc-
ture, in comparison to the “double deckers” that are more frequently observed (e.g.,
Liu et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2014; Awasthi et al. 2019; Pan et al. 2021). Since the
blob and the related cusp-shaped loops rose earlier than the S-shaped loop (Figure
2(d)) and their temperatures evolved diﬀerently from the S-shaped loop, they must
be independent of, and lying higher than, the S-shaped loop. On the other hand,
the long-lasting ﬁlament remained stationary throughout the slipping process and
the subsequent eruption in both Hα (Figure 3) and 304 ˚A, suggesting that it is low-
lying and relatively independent of the eruption. As a result, the S-shaped loop was
‘sandwiched’ by the underlying ﬁlament and the overlying blob. The observation of
counter-streaming ﬂows, however, indicates that there existed some interaction be-
tween the ﬁlament and the sigmoidal loop, most likely through a reconnection event
that was isolated from the slipping reconnection but facilitated the splitting of the
loop from the ﬁlament (§2.6).

3.4. Conclusion

12

Pan et al.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the pre-ﬂare slipping reconnection of a J-
shaped loop system, which slipped through a region of enhanced (column) electric
current density in an episodic and bursty fashion, at a speed comparable to the
Alfv´en speed. With one footpoint ﬁxed and the other shifting along the PIL, the
loop was transformed into a hot S-shaped loop that served as the core structure for
the subsequent eruption. Our analysis therefore suggests a new formation mecha-
nism for “seed” ﬂux ropes (Liu 2020), diﬀering from the prototypical scenario with a
double-J to S transformation; it also brings new insight into slipping reconnection by
revealing the variation of slipping speed, the asymmetric dimming at footpoints, and
asymmetric heating along the loop.

show composite 131 ˚A and 94 ˚A images (see §2.3), with the plus symbol indicating the west-
ern footpoint of the loop. Panels (d–f) & (j–l) show corresponding running diﬀerence images,
superimposed by the PIL (orange) derived from the HMI line-of-sight magnetograms, same
as in Figure 1b. The loop under slipping motions is marked by red plus symbols. The green
‘x’ symbols in (d) indicate the semicircular ﬁlament segment, same as in Figure 1. The
time stamp in each panel is given by the 131 ˚A passband. The insets in panels (d–f) &
(j–l) zoom into the rectangular region around the loop’s western footpoint. In panel (j) the
light and dark green curves show the average intensity variation across the footpoint region
in the X- and Y -direction, whose full width at half maximum is taken as the double of
measurement uncertainty σX and σY of the footpoint position, respectively (see §2.3). The
uncertainties are shown as the blue rectangle in each inset. An animation of the composite
131 ˚A and 94 ˚A images is available online, covering the time interval of 06:28–07:10 UT.
The animation includes a panel at the top to show the GOES 1–8 ˚A light curve, with an
animated vertical line indicating when the images were taken.

Figure 5. Current density distribution in the corona in relation to the loop slippage.
Panel (a) shows the vertical component Jz of current densities derived from HMI vector
magnetograms (hmi.sharp cea 720s data products) during the loop slippage. Vector mag-
netograms are smoothed by a 4 × 4 pixel2 running box before Jz is calculated. Panel (b)
shows the integration of the absolute value of column current density over the height range
from 2.9 to 47.4 Mm. The orange and blue contours in (a) and (b) indicate Bz component of
photospheric magnetic ﬁelds at ±400 G, respectively. The color-coded curves show the loop
position obtained from the composite of 131 and 94 ˚A running diﬀerence images at diﬀerent
time instants. Panel (c) gives the variation of electric current density with increasing height
in a representative region of strong current density (black box in (b)) and in a reference
region of weak current density (white box in (b)). The green shaded range indicate the
standard deviation of current densities in the selected box regions. The gray shaded bar
indicates the height range within which the column current density in (b) is obtained.

Figure 6. Temperature distribution. (a) AIA 131 ˚A image taken at 06:43 UT when the
sigmoidal loop (marked by red plus symbols) was fully ﬂedged through slipping reconnection.
Two yellow curves indicate where we sampled the temperature of the eastern and western
segments, respectively, of the sigmoidal loop (Figure 2(f)). (b) Map of the DEM-weighted
mean temperature. The black curve indicates the position of the semicircular ﬁlament
segment extracted from Figure 1(a). An animation of 131 ˚A images and temperature maps
is available online, covering the time interval of 05:30–07:00 UT. The animation includes
a panel at the top to show the GOES 1–8 ˚A light curve, with an animated vertical line
indicating when the images were taken.

Figure 7. Asymmetric dimming. Panels (a)-(f) show base diﬀerence images of six AIA

area in the dimming region is plotted in Figure 2(c). The red curve indicates the sigmoidal
loop, extracted from the image taken at 06:32 (Figure 4(e)). Panel (g) gives the EM =
DEM·∆T averaged over the elliptical dimming region at diﬀerent time instants (color coded)
within the temperature range log10 T [K] = [5.5, 7.1], which is divided into logarithmically
uniform intervals of log10 ∆T = 0.05 in the DEM analysis.

Figure 8. Counter-streaming ﬂows. Panels (a–d) show the sigmoidal loop in AIA 304
and 131 ˚A original and running diﬀerence images, respectively. The ‘+’ symbol marks the
termination of the downward ﬂow, while the asterisk marks the ﬁnal western footpoint of
the slipping loop. A rectangular region is cut from both original and running diﬀerence
images, rotated to the vertical position, and shown in (e–h) in chronological order. A few
episodes of counter-streaming ﬂows are marked by arrows. An animation of AIA 304 and
131 ˚A original and running diﬀerence images is available online, covering the time interval
of 06:30–07:00 UT. In the animation GOES 1–8 ˚A lightcurve is provided for context in the
top panel, with the time period of slipping motions marked by dashed lines and that of
counter-streaming ﬂows by a shaded bar. An animated vertical solid line indicates when
the images were taken.
