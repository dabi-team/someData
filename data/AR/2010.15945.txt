ABSTRACT
Active region (AR) outﬂows have been studied in detail since the launch of Hinode/EIS and are
believed to provide a possible source of mass and energy to the slow solar wind. In this work, we inves-
tigate the lower atmospheric counterpart of AR outﬂows using observations from the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ). We ﬁnd that the IRIS Si IV, C II and Mg II transition region (TR)
and chromospheric lines exhibit diﬀerent spectral features in the outﬂows as compared to neighboring
regions at the footpoints (“moss”) of hot AR loops. The average redshift of Si IV in the outﬂows region
(≈ 5.5 km s−1) is smaller than typical moss (≈ 12–13 km s−1) and quiet Sun (≈ 7.5 km s−1) values,
while the C II line is blueshifted (≈ -1.1–1.5 km s−1), in contrast to the moss where it is observed to
be redshifted by about ≈ 2.5 km s−1. Further, we observe that the low atmosphere underneath the
coronal outﬂows is highly structured, with the presence of blueshifts in Si IV and positive Mg II k2
asymmetries (which can be interpreted as signatures of chromospheric upﬂows) which are mostly not
observed in the moss. These observations show a clear correlation between the coronal outﬂows and
the chromosphere and TR underneath, which has not been shown before. Our work strongly suggests
that these regions are not separate environments and should be treated together, and that current
leading theories of AR outﬂows, such as the interchange reconnection model, need to take into account
the dynamics of the low atmosphere.

1. INTRODUCTION
Persistent upﬂows at the edges of active regions
(AR outﬂows) are routinely observed by the Hin-
ode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; Culhane et al.
2007) as blueshifts in the spectra of high-temperature
coronal lines (e.g., Harra et al. 2008; Del Zanna 2008;
Doschek et al. 2008; Baker et al. 2009; Brooks & Warren
2011; Hinode Review Team et al. 2019).
Stronger
blueshifts are typically observed in hotter lines (T ≈ 1–
2 MK, e.g. Del Zanna 2008), which often exhibit blue
asymmetries that also increase as a function of temper-
ature (e.g. Bryans et al. 2010). We note that blueshifts
at the edge of ARs were also observed before the launch
of Hinode (Marsch et al. 2004).

The AR outﬂows have often been invoked as a

possible source of slow solar wind (e.g. Sakao et al.
2007). EIS observations, combined with in-situ mea-
surements, have shown that the outﬂows have a slow-
wind plasma composition, in agreement with this hy-
pothesis (e.g. Brooks & Warren 2011, 2012; Brooks et al.
2015). Recent high-resolution observations from Hi-C 2.1
(Rachmeler et al. 2019) have also suggested the existence
of photospheric and coronal components to the outﬂows,
which may explain the variable composition of the slow
wind (Brooks et al. 2020).

Nevertheless, a deﬁnitive model to explain how the out-
ﬂows are driven and connected to the slow wind is still
lacking. A popular scenario assumes that interchange
reconnection between closed dense AR loops and neigh-
bouring open (or distantly connected) large-scale low-

density loops may act as a mechanism for driving the
outﬂows (e.g. Baker et al. 2009; Del Zanna et al. 2011a).
One issue with this picture is that the outﬂows are
not always observed in the vicinity of open ﬁeld lines
(e.g. Culhane et al. 2014), and Boutry et al. (2012) esti-
mated that a signiﬁcant fraction of the outﬂows propa-
gate into long loops connected to distant ARs. A solution
might be provided by a “two-step” reconnection process
(Culhane et al. 2014; Mandrini et al. 2015), where closed
loop plasma ﬁrst travels along long loops and then, in a
second step, is released into the open ﬁeld lines via in-
terchange reconnection.

The height at which the outﬂows are driven, whether in
the corona or the lower atmosphere, is still under debate.
Vanninathan et al. (2015) suggested that there was not
enough chromospheric jet-like activity or spectral asym-
metries in Hα to account for a connection with outﬂows.
On the other hand, He et al. (2010) found intermittent
upﬂows in Hinode/XRT images, associated with chromo-
spheric jets observed by Hinode/SOT and blueshifts in

the EIS He II line, suggesting a possible chromospheric
origin of the outﬂows.

These previous studies showcase the importance of ob-
serving the evolution of the outﬂows throughout diﬀerent
layers of the solar atmosphere.
In this work, we com-
bine EIS observations of coronal outﬂows with recent
spectroscopic observations from IRIS (De Pontieu et al.
2014) at high spatial (0.33–0.4′′) and spectral (≈ 1.5
km s−1) resolution. We focus on studying emission from
Si IV 1393.75 ˚A (TR), C II 1335.71 ˚A (upper chromo-
sphere to TR) and Mg II k 2796.35 ˚A (mid to upper
chromosphere) IRIS lines.

2. OBSERVATIONS
We select two ARs that were simultaneously observed
by IRIS and EIS: AR 12713 on 2018-06-17 (OBS1) and
AR 12672 on 2017-08-26 (OBS2, Figure 1), using large
rasters that covered both the moss and outﬂows at the
edge of the ARs. We selected ARs close to disk cen-
ter, to minimize possible projection eﬀects (Baker et al.
2017; Ghosh et al. 2019). The IRIS datasets were both
dense (slit width = 0.33′′) 320-step rasters, with expo-
sure times texp of 8s and 15s respectively. The EIS OBS1
study was a 87-step raster taken with a raster step of 3′′,
slit width of 2′′ and texp = 40s, while OBS2 was a dense

The two leftmost panels show the ARs under study

2011). The ﬁeld of view (FOV) of the IRIS and EIS
rasters are also overlaid. The third and fourth pan-
els show the intensity and Doppler shifts of the EIS

a single Gaussian ﬁt in each pixel. The Fe XII blueshifts

We used IRIS level 2 data that has been corrected
for geometrical, ﬂat-ﬁeld and dark current eﬀects and
for the orbital variation of the wavelength array. Fur-
ther, we use the O I photospheric line to check the ab-
solute wavelength calibration. After summing the O I
spectra in a quiet region outside the AR, we estimated
that the average velocity shift from the at-rest position
of 1355.598 ˚A was around 0.5 km s−1.

The EIS data are aﬀected by a series of issues which are
described at length in the instrument documentation1,
and that are carefully taken into account in our analysis.

an absolute wavelength calibration, the uncertainty in
the EIS Doppler shift velocities is usually estimated to
be at best ≈ 5 km s−1 (e.g. Young et al. 2012).

To co-align the IRIS and EIS spectroscopic observa-
tions, we ﬁrst compared the SJI 1330 ˚A (logT(K) ≈ 4.3,
De Pontieu et al. 2014) and AIA 1700 ˚A (logT(K) ≈ 4.2,
Sim˜oes et al. 2019) images, which are dominated by
plasma formed at similar temperatures. The EIS im-
ages formed in the He II 256 ˚A line (logT(K) ≈ 4.7)
were also co-aligned to AIA 304 ˚A images, which are
dominated by emission from He II (O’Dwyer et al. 2010;
Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2011). To co-align all the images
we used standard cross-correlation routines available in
SolarSoft, and also veriﬁed the alignment by eye. Us-
ing these diﬀerent methods we estimate a co-alignment
uncertainty between IRIS and EIS of ≈ 4′′, which is rea-
sonable considering that the full-width half maximum
(FWHM) of the EIS point-spread-function is ≈ 3′′.

2.1. IRIS observations of outﬂows
In this Section, we focus on observing the spectral fea-
tures of the IRIS lines in the region underneath the coro-
nal outﬂows. Figures 2 and 3 provide an overview of
the IRIS observations in Si IV (top), C II (middle) and
Mg II (bottom) for OBS1 and 2 respectively. The ﬁrst
row shows total intensity, Doppler shift, and FWHM of
the Si IV line, assuming a single Gaussian ﬁt, as well as
a red-blue (RB) asymmetry map, which was calculated

using the algorithm described in Tian et al. (2011) with
a ± 40 km s−1 velocity interval and a 5 km s−1 bin.
Zero-th (intensity), ﬁrst (velocity) and second (standard
deviation, expressed in km s−1) moments of the C II line
are shown in the second row. A map of ﬁrst moments,
only for proﬁles which are identiﬁed as single peaked, is
also shown in the third panel of the second row. Be-
ing optically thick, the C II line has a complex forma-
tion and can exhibit two or more peaks. We identiﬁed
the single peaked proﬁles using the method described in
Rathore et al. (2015). The bottom rows of Figs. 2 and 3
show the Mg II 2796 ˚A line k3 (line core) intensity and ve-
locity, the k2 peak asymmetry (diﬀerence between the in-
tensity of the red and blue k2 peaks) and peak separation
(diﬀerence between the wavelengths of the red and blue
k2 peaks, expressed as velocity). The k3 Doppler shifts
provide velocity diagnostics in the upper chromosphere,
where the line core is formed, while the k2 asymmetry
and separation have been shown to provide good diag-
nostics of ﬂows and velocity gradients (Leenaarts et al.
2013). In particular, a positive/negative k2 asymmetry is
typically indicative of up/downﬂows (because it is caused
by increased absorption in the blue/red wavelengths).
The contours of the Fe XII outﬂows are also overlaid
in yellow. Finally, each row includes a normalised his-
togram of Doppler velocities (for Si IV and C II, with bin
of 5 km s−1) or k2 asymmetries (for Mg II, with a bin of
100 DN) inside the two boxes overlaid in the respective

 
 
 
 
 
 
variable maps (black and blue boxes for moss and outﬂow
regions respectively). The percentage of pixels with neg-
ative velocity (for Si IV and C II) or positive counts (for
Mg II) are also reported in each panel for both moss and
outﬂow regions. Further, we calculated the percentage
of pixels taking into account the estimated error on our
velocities (0.5 km s−1) by setting the threshold velocity
to 0.5 and -0.5 km s−1. The percentages of Si IV upﬂows
and their associated range of values taking into account
this velocity uncertainty are: 14.4% (12–17%) in the out-
ﬂows and 3.3% (3.1–3.7%) in the moss for OBS1, and
12.9% (11–15%) in the outﬂows and 0.6% (0.5–0.7%) in
the moss for OBS2. These values suggest that the frac-
tion of pixels showing Si IV upﬂows in the outﬂow region
is signiﬁcantly higher (at least 4 times higher in OBS1)
than that in the moss.

Figures 2 and 3 show some clear features that dis-
tinguish the outﬂow from the moss region: (1) the av-
erage distribution of Si IV Doppler shift is shifted to-
wards the blue in the outﬂow regions, with an average
value of µout ≈ 5.4–5.6 km s−1 and standard devia-
tion σout ≈ 4.8–4.6 km s−1 for OBS1 and 2 (compared
to the moss values of µmoss ≈ 12.6–13.3 km s−1 and
σmoss ≈ 7.4–4.6 km s−1 respectively); (2) Si IV upﬂows
up to ≈ -10 km s−1 are observed in the outﬂow region
but not in the moss, where the line is consistently red-
shifted; (3) a similar trend is visible in C II, with the
diﬀerence that the velocity distributions in outﬂows and
moss regions are both shifted towards the blue compared
to those of Si IV. The values for C II are: µout ≈ -1.4 and
-1.1 km s−1, σout ≈ 2.3 and 2.4 km s−1, in contrast to
µmoss ≈ 2.6 and 2.4 km s−1, σmoss ≈ 3.5 and 2.5 km s−1
for OBS1 and OBS2 respectively; (4) we observe a higher
concentration of Mg II proﬁles with positive k2 asymme-
try (i.e. upﬂows) in the outﬂows than in the moss region.
The O I 1355.598 ˚A line also appears to be more
blueshifted in the outﬂows compared to the moss. How-
ever, since the line is faint, the Doppler shift measure-
ments can be uncertain. No peculiar features are ob-
served in the Mg II triplet lines in the outﬂow regions.

2.2. Combining IRIS and EIS observations for OBS1
Figure 4 shows an overview of the EIS lines (OBS1)
formed over a broad range of temperatures. The O V
192.9 ˚A line is close in wavelength to the hot Fe XI
192.83 ˚A and Ca XVII 192.82 ˚A lines (Young et al.
2007), but can be usually reliably resolved using a multi-
Gaussian ﬁt. We note that the unblended O V line at
248.46 ˚A was not included in this observation program,
while other oxygen TR lines such as O IV and O VI are
too faint. The Fe VIII 185.21 ˚A line is also blended with
the hotter Ni XVI 185.23 ˚A line which is mostly visi-
ble in the AR cores (Young et al. 2007). The Fe VIII
line is formed at the same temperature as the Si VII
275.75 ˚A line, which is largely free of blends and also
shown in Fig. 4. Both Fe VIII and Si VII show some
faint blueshifted emission in the outﬂow region.

Fe XIII 202.04 ˚A (logT(K) ≈ 6.25) lines are also
included in this study and they are both mostly free of
blends (Young et al. 2007; Del Zanna et al. 2011b).

Figure 5 summarizes the average velocities observed
by EIS and IRIS in the moss and outﬂows regions of
OBS1. These values have been obtained by averaging
the velocity inside the boxes highlighted in Fig. 2 and
Fig. 4. For Fe XII, we take the Doppler shifts of the
192.39 ˚A line, but also include the values obtained for
the 195.12 ˚A line (triangles) for reference. For the Mg II
line we used the k3 Doppler shift.
Figure 5 shows a similar

trend of

as that reported in Figure 3 of Del Zanna (2008). The
cooler EIS and IRIS lines (logT(K) ≈ 4–5.4) show that
the trend is almost inverted in the lower atmosphere,
with the O V, Si IV and Mg II lines being on average
redshifted, while interestingly the C II line is slightly
blueshifted.

For comparison, Figure 5 also shows the Doppler shift
trend for the moss region. The blueshifts are consis-
tently smaller while the redshifts are larger in the moss
as compared to the outﬂow region, although the trend of
Doppler shifts vs temperature appears to be similar in
the two regions.

It is important to note that Figs. 2 and 3 reveal a more
complicated picture than that suggested by the averaged
trend of Fig. 5, with the presence of small-scale TR and
chromospheric upﬂows in the high-resolution IRIS data.

3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
IRIS TR and chromospheric observations oﬀer a
unique view of the lower atmospheric counterpart of the
long-studied AR outﬂows at very high spatial and spec-
tral resolution. We analysed two observations of AR out-
ﬂows with IRIS and EIS and found that:

• IRIS reveals that the low atmosphere underneath
the coronal outﬂows appears to be highly struc-
tured, with a percentage of ≈ 13% pixels showing
small scale upﬂows in Si IV (up to ≈ -10 km s−1),
as compared to 3 % or less in the moss.

• The Si IV TR line is also on average less redshifted
in the outﬂow region (≈ 5.5 km s−1) than in the
moss (≈ 13 km s−1). The average Si IV redshift
in the outﬂows is also lower than typical QS val-
ues (7.5 km s−1 from an IRIS sample observation,
in agreement with measurements from previous in-
struments, e.g. Doschek et al. 1976; Brekke et al.
1997). In contrast with the moss region, where the
proﬁles show some red asymmetry, the Si IV spec-
tra show no asymmetry or a modest blue asymme-
try in the outﬂow region.

• The Mg II k2 asymmetry maps show more pro-
ﬁles with a higher red peak in the outﬂow re-
gion than in the moss. This can be interpreted
as evidence of upﬂows (i.e., more absorption in the
blue wing, Leenaarts et al. 2013; Sainz Dalda et al.
2019). The average k3 velocities in the outﬂow re-
gion are also smaller (≈ 2 km s−1) compared to the
moss (≈ 3 km s−1) .

Fig. 4.— Intensity (top) and Doppler shift (bottom) maps of EIS lines formed at diﬀerent temperatures for OBS1. The outﬂows and

moss boxed regions (same as those in Fig. 2) are overlaid on each panel.
• While being redshifted in the moss (≈ 2.5 km s−1),
the C II line is on average sligthly blueshifted (≈ -
1.1–1.5 km s−1) in the outﬂow region. As a com-
parison, Rathore et al. (2015) previously reported
median values of C II Doppler shifts (calculated
assuming Gaussian ﬁts) of ≈ 0 km s−1 in the QS
network and plage, and ≈-2.3 km s−1 in the QS
internetwork.

Our ﬁndings show that there is a clear correlation be-
tween the chromosphere and TR observed by IRIS and
the coronal AR outﬂows observed by EIS. Such correla-
tion has never been shown before and is surprising given
previous work which found no connection between chro-
mospheric activity and coronal outﬂows using Hα data
from IBIS (Vanninathan et al. 2015). However, it is not
clear why such a connection should make itself visible
through the asymmetry of an optically thick line with
a complex formation mechanism like Hα. Our results
suggest that the restricted focus on blue-ward asymme-
tries in the Hα line misses the actual association between
chromospheric and TR signals and coronal outﬂows.

There are no models that can currently explain the
regional diﬀerences of chromospheric and TR properties
between outﬂow regions and moss or QS. We cannot de-
termine from these preliminary studies whether this as-
sociation occurs because the mechanism that drives out-
ﬂows occurs at these low heights, or because the outﬂow
regions are actually driven in the larger coronal volume
but have a diﬀerent coronal thermodynamic environment
that indirectly aﬀects the lower-lying regions, due for ex-
ample to the fact that AR outﬂows may be connected
to open ﬁeld regions, as it is commonly assumed. Com-
parisons between the closed ﬁeld regions in QS and open
ﬁeld regions in coronal holes (CHs) have reported subtle
diﬀerences with CH network showing somewhat less red-
shifted proﬁles in low TR spectral lines (McIntosh et al.
2011), similarly to what we observe here. However,

from a preliminary analysis, other properties such as the
Si IV line widths and Mg II spectral properties seem to
behave diﬀerently in CHs and AR outﬂows.

Previous work has demonstrated that the dynam-
ics of the upper chromosphere and low TR in plage
are strongly aﬀected by processes that are driven
from the lower atmosphere. For instance, magneto-
acoustic shocks are ubiquitous in plage (Hansteen et al.
2006) and have a major impact on the properties
IV lines (e.g.,
h&k, C II and Si
of the Mg II
De Pontieu et al. 2015). Similarly, the disk counterparts
of type II spicules lead to sudden blueshifted excursions
in chromospheric lines and broadened linear features
in Si IV (Tian et al. 2014; Rouppe van der Voort et al.
2015; De Pontieu et al. 2017). Perhaps the modiﬁcation
of these phenomena in the open ﬁelds of outﬂow regions
plays a role in explaining our results? For example, it is
well known that spicules are taller and have diﬀerent dy-
namical properties in open ﬁelds (Beckers 1968). There
are also suggestions from numerical models that the mag-
netic topology of a region plays an important role and
that TR emission and ﬂow patterns are signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent in short, low-lying loops (that are not connected to
the corona), from those in longer, higher coronal loops,
with the height of heating determining the strength of
TR redshifts and/or blueshifts (Guerreiro et al. 2013;
Hansteen et al. 2014). Perhaps the observed diﬀerences
in TR properties are related to a diﬀerent proportion
of low-lying to higher loops or that heating occurs at a
diﬀerent height in AR outﬂow sites compared to moss
regions (or CHs)?

More extensive statistical studies and numerical mod-
eling are clearly required to settle these issues. The exact
impact of the open ﬁelds on the upper chromosphere and
low TR thus remains uncertain.

Nevertheless, our work strongly suggests that the low
atmosphere and the corona should not be treated as sep-
arate environments, but rather that the processes occur-

ring throughout diﬀerent layers of the solar atmosphere
are likely connected, and should be addressed together
by a global model. This is also supported by the fact
that the leading theories to explain the ﬁrst ionization
potential (FIP) eﬀect are based on the idea that the FIP
fractionation most likely takes place in the upper chro-
mosphere (e.g. Laming 2015; Laming et al. 2019).

So how do our IRIS observations ﬁt within the con-
text of the most recent models of outﬂows? These are
based on interchange reconnection between closed and
open ﬁeld lines. Modelling by Bradshaw et al. (2011) (in
1D) and Harra et al. (2012) (in 3D) has demonstrated
that coronal outﬂows could be explained as pressure-
driven ﬂows following reconnection between closed and
open ﬁeld lines. However, both papers mostly focused
on the synthesis of hotter emission observed by EIS.
Our work suggests that future outﬂow models need to
include a proper treatment of the chromosphere and TR
(i.e., including optically thick radiative losses, convective

7

motions, magneto-acoustic shocks, and spicules) to ex-
plain both EIS and IRIS observations. Such models may
be able to elucidate whether waves and heating associ-
ated with spicules (De Pontieu et al. 2017) plays any role
in outﬂow regions, possibly related to diﬀerences in the
underlying photospheric magnetic ﬁelds (Samanta et al.
2019).

Our work demonstrates that to understand the origin
of AR outﬂows it is crucial to follow the plasma dynam-
ics through diﬀerent layers of the atmosphere. Our re-
sults raise several unsolved questions about the nature of
outﬂow regions and provide a challenge to previous and
future models on outﬂows. Coordinated observations be-
tween IRIS and high-sensitivity radio observatories, such
as the Jansky Very Large Array, as well as the recent
Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter missions, will be
key to obtain a more complete picture of the outﬂow re-
gions and their connection to the solar wind.
