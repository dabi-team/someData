The production of the Higgs boson in photon-photon interactions with proton and nucleus beams at three planned
or proposed future CERN colliders — the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), the high-energy
LHC (HE-LHC), and the Future Circular Collider (FCC) — is studied. The cross sections for the process

puted with madgraph 5 modiﬁed to include the corresponding elastic γ ﬂuxes, for Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, Kr-Kr, Ar-Ar,
snn ≈ 3–100 TeV. Simulations of the
O-O, p-Pb, and p-p over the nucleon-nucleon collision energy range
γ γ → H → b¯b decay mode — including realistic (mis)tagging and reconstruction eﬃciencies for the ﬁnal-state
b-jets, as well as appropriate kinematical selection criteria to reduce the similarly computed γ γ → b¯b, c¯c, q¯q
continuum backgrounds — have been carried out. Taking into account the expected luminosities for all systems,
the yields and signiﬁcances for observing the Higgs boson in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) are estimated.
At the HL-LHC and HE-LHC, the colliding systems with larger Higgs signiﬁcance are Ar-Ar(6.3 TeV) and
Kr-Kr(12.5 TeV) respectively, but 3σ evidence for two-photon Higgs production would require 200 and 30
times larger integrated luminosities than those planned today at both machines. Factors of ten can be gained
by running for a year, rather than the typical 1-month heavy-ion LHC operation, but the process will likely
remain unobserved until a higher energy hadron collider, such as the FCC, is built. In the latter machine, the 5σ
observation of Higgs production in UPCs is feasible in just the ﬁrst nominal run of Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions at

INTRODUCTION

Heavy ions accelerated at high energies are surrounded by huge electromagnetic (e.m.) ﬁelds generated by the
collective action of their Z individual proton charges. In the equivalent photon approximation (EPA) [1], such strong
e.m. ﬁelds can be identiﬁed as quasireal photon beams with very low virtualities Q2 < 1/R2
A and large longitudinal
energies of up to ωmax ≈ γL/RA, where RA is the radius of the charge and γL = Ebeam/mN,p is the beam Lorentz factor
for nucleon or proton mass mN,p = 0.9315, 0.9382 GeV [2, 3]. On the one hand, since the photon ﬂux scales as
the squared charge of each colliding particle, photon-photon cross sections are enhanced millions of times for heavy
ions (up to Z4 ≈ 5 · 107 for Pb-Pb) compared to proton or electron beams. On the other, proton (and lighter ions)
feature larger ωmax values thanks to their lower radii RA and larger beam γL factors, and can thereby reach higher
photon-photon center-of-mass (c.m.) energies. At the energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), photons emitted
from nuclei (with radii RA ≈ 1.2 A1/3 fm) are almost on-shell (virtuality Q < 0.06 GeV, for mass numbers A > 16),
and reach longitudinal energies of up to hundreds of GeV, whereas photon ﬂuxes from protons (RA ≈ 0.7 fm)
have larger virtualities, Q ≈ 0.28 GeV, and longitudinal energies in the TeV range [3]. Table I summarizes the
relevant characteristics of photon-photon collisions in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of proton and nuclear beams
at three planned or proposed CERN future hadron colliders: the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [4], the high-
energy LHC (HE-LHC) [4, 5], and the Future Circular Collider (FCC) [6]. The beam luminosities for light- and
heavy-ions considered here are those discussed in Refs. [4, 6]. Although the beam luminosities for p-p are 7 orders
of magnitude larger than those for Pb-Pb, the running conditions with multiple pileup p-p collisions per bunch
crossing hinder the measurement of exclusive γ γ interactions with central masses at 125-GeV (unless one installs,
in the LHC case, very forward proton taggers at 420 m inside the tunnel1, with 10-picosecond time resolution [7]).

1 We note that a similar forward tagging of lead ions at the LHC is impossible, given that the ions carry a much larger longitudinal momentum,

pL = 5.5 TeV×A ≈ 600 TeV, than the protons, and thereby are barely deﬂected after a photon-photon interaction.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus, in the present study we take Lint = 1 fb−1 as the value potentially integrated under low-pileup conditions that
allow the reconstruction of exclusive photon-photon ﬁnal states in p-p collisions. In all cases in Table I, one can see
that the maximum photon-photon c.m. energy reaches above the kinematical threshold for Higgs boson production,
(cid:112)
γ γ (cid:38) mH = 125 GeV, through the process depicted in Fig. I (left). The observation of the γ γ → H process
smax
would provide, ﬁrst, an independent measurement of the H–photon loop-induced coupling based not on the Higgs
decay (as measured at the LHC [8]) but on its s-channel production mode. In addition, precise measurements of the
Γ(H → γ γ) partial width derived from σ(γ γ → H → b¯b) ∝ Γ(H → γ γ) · BR(H → b¯b), and of the Higgs branching
ratio BR(H→ γ γ) determined at a future e+e− collider, would also provide a model-independent extraction of the
total Higgs width, via Γtot
H

= Γ(H → γ γ)/BR(H → γ γ) [9].

The possibility to produce the Higgs boson by exploiting the huge photon ﬁelds in UPCs of ions, AA

γγ
−−→(A)H(A),
where the scalar boson is produced at midrapidity and the colliding ions (A) survive their electromagnetic interaction
(Fig. 1 left), was ﬁrst considered 30 years ago in several works [10]. Detailed studies of the actual measurement
of UPC-production of the Higgs boson in its dominant b¯b decay mode, including realistic experimental acceptance
and eﬃciencies for the signal and the γ γ → b¯b, c¯c, q¯q continuum backgrounds (Fig. 1 right), were ﬁrst presented in
Ref. [11] for ultraperipheral proton-nucleus (p-A) and nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions at LHC energies. This work
showed that, for the nominal integrated luminosities, the scalar boson was unobservable in UPCs at the LHC unless
one integrated at least 300 times more luminosity than that expected for the standard 1-month heavy-ion operation.
On the other hand, similar studies [12] carried out within the FCC project, have indicated that the observation
of Higgs production in UPCs was clearly possible in just the ﬁrst nominal run of Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions at
√
= 39 and 63 TeV respectively. We note also that detailed studies of γ γ → H were performed in the past in

the context of the photon collider project [9, 13, 14], exploiting the polarized and monochromatic γ beams resulting
from Compton-backscattering of laser light at future e+e− linear colliders, and with reduced backgrounds (thanks to
the γ polarization) compared to those considered in the present study. In this work here, we collect our UPC Higgs
results carried out in the context of the FCC studies, and discuss for the ﬁrst time the conditions needed for an UPC
Higgs boson measurement in the upcoming HL-LHC phase, as well as at the proposed HE-LHC with twice larger
c.m. energies. Our new work includes not only higher luminosities than originally planned for the LHC, but also
collisions of lighter ions (Xe-Xe, Kr-Kr, Ar-Ar, O-O) never considered before.

II. THEORETICAL SETUP

The madgraph 5 (v.2.6.5) Monte Carlo (MC) event generator [15] is employed to compute the UPC Higgs boson
and diquark continuum cross sections, modiﬁed following the implementation discussed in detail in [11], as well as to
generate the corresponding events for subsequent analysis. The Higgs cross section is obtained from the convolution
of the Weizs¨acker-Williams EPA photon ﬂuxes for the proton and/or ions, and the elementary γ γ → H cross section
(with H-γ coupling parametrized in the Higgs eﬀective ﬁeld theory [16]), via

(cid:90)

σA1A2→H =

dx1 dx2 fγ/A1 (x1) fγ/A2 (x2) ˆσγ γ→H ,

(1)

where x = ω/E is the fraction of the energy of the incoming ion carried by each photon. The same expression is
used for the b¯b, c¯c, q¯q continuums, where now the elementary ˆσγ γ→b¯b,c¯c,q¯q cross sections at diquark invariant masses
around the Higgs mass are directly calculated at leading order (LO) by madgraph 5. For protons, the madgraph 5
default γ ﬂux is used, given by the energy spectrum of Ref. [17]:

where xi = x mN bmin, K0, K1 are the zero- and ﬁrst-order modiﬁed Bessel functions of the second kind, and for the
diﬀerent nuclear radii RA, we use the data from elastic lepton-nucleus collisions [19]. We exclude nuclear overlap
by imposing b1 > RA1 and b2 > RA2 for each photon ﬂux, and applying a correcting factor on the ﬁnal cross section
that depends on the ratio of Higgs mass over

snn [20].

√

After cross section determination, the event generation is carried out for the dominant Higgs decay mode, H → b¯b
with 56% branching fraction [21], as it is the ﬁnal state that provides the largest number of signal events. The same
setup is used to generate the exclusive two-photon production of b¯b and (misidentiﬁed) c¯c and light-quark (q¯q) jet
pairs, which constitute the most important physical background for the H→ b¯b measurement. For the HL-LHC and
HE-LHC systems, the analysis is carried out at the parton level only, whereas for FCC energies, we have further used
pythia 8.2 [22] to shower and hadronize the two ﬁnal-state b-jets generated, which are then reconstructed with the
Durham kt algorithm [23] (exclusive 2-jets ﬁnal-state) using fastjet 3.0 [24]. Given that the ﬁnal state consists just
of two quarks (jets) exclusively produced, without any background that can potentially bias the four-momentum jet
(quark) reconstruction, and that we take into account realistic jet resolution eﬀects in the ﬁnal dijet invariant mass
analysis by appropriately smearing the parton-level results, no apparent diﬀerences exist between the parton- and
hadron-level results, as found previously in similar FCC-ee studies [25, 26] where, for the same set of kinematical
cuts, both results are fully consistent within statistical uncertainties.

III. TOTAL HIGGS CROSS SECTIONS

The computed ultraperipheral Higgs boson cross sections as a function of

snn are shown in Fig. 2 (left) and
listed in the before-last column of Table I for all p-p, p-A, and A-A systems considered. All theoretical cross

√

sections have a conservative 20% uncertainty (not quoted) to cover diﬀerent charge form factors and nuclear overlap
conditions [27, 28]. We note that the quoted cross sections are purely “elastic”, i.e. both incoming ions survive the
e.m. interaction. As discussed in [11], γ γ interactions can also be “semielastic”, and/or “resolved”, with one (or
both) quasireal photons being radiated from individual proton(s), and/or from individual quarks, inside the colliding
γγ
−−→A H X,
ions. In this latter case, one (or both) ions breakup at very forward rapidities after photon emission, AA
and the Higgs boson cross sections can be enhanced by about a factor of two compared to the pure elastic results.
We do not consider these cases here, and focus on the elastic processes alone.

Figure 2 (left) indicates that, as expected, the bigger the charge of the colliding ions, the larger the UPC Higgs
cross sections, but such an advantage is mitigated in terms of ﬁnal yields by the correspondingly reduced beam
luminosities for heavier ions. Figure 2 (right) shows the product of UPC Higgs cross section times the integrated
luminosities for each colliding system in the HL-LHC and HE-LHC energy range. At the LHC, we see that despite
the fact that Pb-Pb features the largest Higgs cross section, σ(γ γ → H) = 15 pb, there are about 2–3 times more
scalar bosons produced per month in Ar-Ar and Kr-Kr collisions (0.40 versus 0.15, last column of Table I) thanks
to the comparatively larger luminosities and c.m. energies of the latter with respect to lead beams. At the HE-LHC,
the Higgs cross sections are about a factor of 10 larger than at the LHC, and most colliding systems feature 1.5–2.5
Higgs bosons produced per month. The most competitive systems to try a measurement of UPC Higgs production are
Ar-Ar at HL-LHC and Kr-Kr at HE-LHC respectively. At the FCC, the cross sections are two orders of magnitude
= 39 and
larger than at the LHC, reaching σ(γ γ → H) = 1.75 nb and 1.5 pb in Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions at
63 TeV which, for the nominal Lint = 110 nb−1 and 29 pb−1 per-month integrated luminosities, yield ∼200 and 45
Higgs bosons (corresponding to 110 and 25 bosons in the b¯b decay mode), respectively.

IV. DATA ANALYSIS AND HIGGS BOSON SIGNIFICANCES

The observation of the Higgs boson in UPCs relies on the measurement of two exclusive b-jets with invariant
masses peaked at mH, on top of a background of exclusive γγ → b¯b, c¯c, q¯q continuum pairs, where charm and light
(q = u, d, s) quarks are misidentiﬁed as b-quarks. For all colliding systems, the pure MC-level background continuum
cross sections over mH ≈ 100–150 GeV, computed with the same madgraph 5 setup described above, are about 25,
200, and 500 times larger respectively than the Higgs signal. Experimentally, triggering the online selection of such
type of events is straightforward given their unique signature characterized by two back-to-back high transverse mo-
mentum (pT ) jets in an otherwise empty detector. The data analysis follows the strategy ﬁrst proposed in Ref. [11],
where more details, not repeated here, can be found. The following acceptance and reconstruction performances

have been assumed: jet reconstruction over |η| < 2 (< 5 for FCC), 7% b-jet energy resolution (resulting in a dijet
mass resolution of σ j j ≈ 6 GeV at the Higgs peak), 70% b-jet tagging eﬃciency, and 5% (1.5%) b-jet mistagging
probability for a c (light-ﬂavour q) quark. We note that the b-jet reconstruction and identiﬁcation performances are
expected to be better in the very “clean” exclusive environment of UPCs than in the current high-pileup p-p collisions
at the LHC [29]. The pseudorapidity acceptance cut |η| < 2 used for HL-LHC and HE-LHC keeps a large fraction
of signal jets (around 80%), while removing 2/3 of the background jets, which are much more forward/backward-
peaked. In terms of jet (mis)tagging eﬃciencies, for the double b-jet ﬁnal-state of interest, these lead to a ∼50%
eﬃciency for the MC-generated signal (S ), and a total reduction of the misidentiﬁed c¯c and q¯q continuum back-
grounds (B) by factors of ∼400 and ∼4500 respectively. The sum of remaining continuum backgrounds can be
further reduced through proper kinematical cuts by requiring [11]:

(i) both jets to have transverse momenta around half the Higgs mass, pT ≈ mH/2 ≈ 55–67 GeV, as expected for
two back-to-back jets from the decay of an UPC Higgs produced almost at rest, thereby suppressing more than
95% of the continuum, while removing about half of the signal;

(ii) the angle of the jets to be within | cos θ j1 j2 | < 0.5 — to exploit the fact that the angular distribution in the
helicity frame of the Higgs decay b-jets is isotropic while the continuum (with quarks propagating in the t-
or u- channels) is peaked in the forward–backward directions — further suppressing the backgrounds while
leaving almost untouched the number of signal events; and

(iii) the pair jet mass to be within ±1.4σ j j around the Higgs mass (i.e. 116 (cid:46) mb¯b
For all systems, the overall loss of Higgs signal events due to the acceptance and kinematical cuts (i.e. without
accounting for (mis)identiﬁcation eﬃciencies) is around a factor of two, whereas the backgrounds are reduced by
factors of 30 to 100, resulting in a ﬁnal S /B ≈ 1 for all colliding species.

(cid:46) 134 GeV).

The current analysis is based on LO estimates for the signal and background cross sections. The contributions
from higher-order corrections to γ γ → (H) → b¯b and γ γ → b¯b, that can be signiﬁcant in some regions of phase
space, have been studied in detail in [14] for the photon linear collider case. Our applied selection criteria, in
particular the exclusive back-to-back 2-jets requirement and the | cos θ j1 j2 | < 0.5 cut, eﬀectively remove most of such
higher-order contributions. Also, we note that any theoretical uncertainty on the photon ﬂuxes impacts in a similar
way the expected yields for signal and background, and thereby leaves the S /B ratio basically unaﬀected. Last
but not least, more advanced multivariate studies could be contemplated, rather than the simpler “cut-based” criteria
applied here, that could further improve the separation of signal over background.

Table II lists the cross sections after each event selection step, as well as the ﬁnal number of events expected (for
the nominal integrated luminosities per run) for signal and backgrounds in the systems with larger signal strength at
= 39 TeV, as
each collider (Fig. 2, right): Ar-Ar at
= 39, 63 TeV ﬁrst discussed in [12]. The last column
well as the full MC results obtained for Pb-Pb and p-Pb at
of Table II lists the ﬁnal number of signal and background events expected after all selection criteria for the nominal
1-month (106 s) run operation. The expected number of Higgs per month, after cuts, at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC
are below unity, whereas one expects 5 to 20 reconstructed H(b¯b) events at the FCC.

The ﬁnal signiﬁcance of the signal can be derived from the number of counts within ±1.4σ j j around the Gaussian
Higgs peak (i.e. 116 (cid:46) mb¯b
(cid:46) 134 GeV) over the dijet continuum remaining after cuts. In a simpliﬁed cut-and-
count approach, one can estimate the statistical sample increase needed for a 3σ evidence from the NHiggs values
listed in the last column of Table II. For an integrated luminosity two-hundred times larger than the nominal for
Ar-Ar(6.3 TeV), one has S /
12 ≈ 3. The same numbers at the HE-LHC, for thirty times more
luminosity integrated in Kr-Kr(12.5 TeV), yield S /
B ≈ 9/
10 ≈ 3. Thus, reaching 3σ evidence of UPC Higgs-
production at HL-LHC and at HE-LHC, requires at least factors of ×200 and ×30 more integrated luminosities in
Ar-Ar and Kr-Kr collisions, respectively, than currently designed. Figure 3 shows the expected invariant dijet mass
distributions after selection criteria for signal and backgrounds at the HL-LHC (Ar-Ar, left) and HE-LHC (Kr-Kr,
right) for such increased integrated luminosities. A factor of ten increase in Lint could be gained at both colliders
simply by running during the time (107 s) typical of a proton-proton run, instead of the nominal 1-month( 106 s)
heavy-ion run operation. Such a longer run, motivated by Higgs- rather than heavy-ion physics, would allow for an
evidence of the process at HE-LHC, by combining three experiments (or over three runs in a single one). Achieving
the same signiﬁcance at the HL-LHC seems out of reach, unless an extra factor of ×20 in the instantaneous Ar-Ar
luminosity is accomplished by some currently unidentiﬁed means. In any case, going from the simple evidence to a
5σ observation would require yet another extra (5/3)2 ≈ 2.8 increase in the collected data. These estimates indicate
that the UPC Higgs observation will very likely remain elusive at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC.

All the derived number of events and signiﬁcances are based on the aforementioned simple set of kinematical
cuts and signal-over-background estimates, and can be likely further improved by using more advanced multivari-
ate studies and a full parametric shape analysis for the signiﬁcance calculation. Notwithstanding such potential
improvements, the numbers presented here provide realistic estimates of the feasibility of the UPC Higgs boson
measurements at all currently (planned or under consideration) future CERN hadron colliders.

V. SUMMARY

We have presented prospect studies for the measurement of the two-photon production of the Higgs boson in
ultraperipheral Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, Kr-Kr, Ar-Ar, O-O, p-Pb, and p-p collisions at three planned CERN future hadron
colliders: HL-LHC, HE-LHC, and FCC. Cross sections have been obtained with madgraph 5, modiﬁed to include the
corresponding nuclear equivalent photon ﬂuxes with no hadronic overlap of the colliding beams, for nucleon-nucleon
= 3–100 TeV. The Higgs cross sections roughly rise by a factor of ten (one hundred) when
c.m. energies over
increasing the c.m. energy from the HL-LHC to the HE-LHC (FCC). At the HL-LHC and HE-LHC, although Pb-Pb
features the largest Higgs cross section, σ(γ γ → H) = 15, and 150 pb thanks to its Z4-ampliﬁed photon ﬂuxes, the
most competitive systems to try a measurement of UPC Higgs production are Ar-Ar and Kr-Kr respectively, thanks
to the larger available beam luminosities for such lighter species.

The observation of the Higgs boson in UPCs, via its dominant b¯b decay channel, relies on the measurement of
two exclusive b-jets with invariant masses peaked at mH, on top of a background of γγ → b¯b, c¯c, q¯q continuum pairs,
where charm and light (q = u, d, s) quarks are misidentiﬁed as b-quarks. The same madgraph 5 setup used to compute
Higgs cross sections and generate the corresponding events has been employed for the exclusive two-photon produc-
tion of b¯b, c¯c, and q¯q dijets. The HL-LHC and HE-LHC analyses have been carried out at the parton level, whereas
for FCC energies the b-quarks have been showered and hadronized with pythia 8, and reconstructed in a exclusive
two-jet ﬁnal-state with the kT algorithm. Given the simplicity of the exclusive ﬁnal states considered, no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between hadron- and parton-level results exist. By assuming realistic jet acceptance, reconstruction
performances, and (mis)tagging eﬃciencies, and applying appropriate kinematical cuts on the jet pT and angles, it
has been shown that the H(b¯b) signal can be reconstructed on top of the γ γ → b¯b, c¯c, q¯q continuum backgrounds.
On the one hand, reaching 3σ evidence of UPC Higgs-production at HL-LHC and at HE-LHC, requires factors of
about ×200 and ×30 more integrated luminosities in Ar-Ar and Kr-Kr collisions, respectively, than currently planned
for both machines. Factors of ten in integrated luminosity can be gained running for the duration (107 s) typical of a

proton-proton run, rather than the nominal 1-month heavy-ion operation. This would open up the possibility of a 3σ
evidence at the HE-LHC, but would still fall too short for any feasible measurement at the HL-LHC. On the other
hand, the measurement of γ γ → H → b¯b would yield about 20 (5) signal counts after cuts in Pb-Pb (p-Pb) collisions
for their nominal integrated luminosities per run. Observation of the photon-fusion Higgs production at the 5σ-level
is achievable in the ﬁrst FCC run by combining the measurements of two experiments (or doubling the luminosity in
a single one) in Pb-Pb, and by running for about 8 months (or 4 months and combining two experiments) in the p-Pb
case. The feasibility studies presented here indicate the Higgs physics potential open to study in γγ ultraperipheral
ion collisions at current and future CERN hadron colliders, eventually providing an independent measurement of the
H-γ coupling not based on Higgs decays but on a s-channel production mode, as well as of its total width combining
the photon-fusion measurement with the H → γ γ decay branching ratio accessible at a future e+e− collider.
