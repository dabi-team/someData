ABSTRACT

We report on observations of the two newly-identiﬁed reconnection geometries involving erupting
ﬂux ropes. In 3D, a ﬂux rope can reconnect either with a surrounding coronal arcade (recently named
“ar–rf” reconnection) or with itself (“rr–rf” reconnection), and both kinds of reconnection create a
new ﬂux rope ﬁeld line and a ﬂare loop. For the ﬁrst time, we identify all four constituents of both
reconnections in a solar eruptive event, the ﬁlament eruption of 2011 June 07 observed by SDO/AIA.
The ar–rf reconnection manifests itself as shift of one leg of the ﬁlament by more than 25(cid:48)(cid:48) northward.
At its previous location, a ﬂare arcade is formed, while the new location of the ﬁlament leg previously
corresponded to a footpoint of a coronal loop in 171 ˚A. In addition, the evolution of the ﬂare ribbon
hooks is also consistent with the occurrence of ar–rf reconnection as predicted by MHD simulations.
Speciﬁcally, the growing hook sweeps footpoints of preeruptive coronal arcades, and these locations
become inside the hook. Furthermore, the rr–rf reconnection occurs during the peak phase above the
ﬂare arcade, in an apparently X-type geometry involving a pair of converging bright ﬁlament strands
in the erupting ﬁlament. A new ﬂare loop forms near the leg of one of the strands, while a bright blob,
representing a remnant of the same strand, is seen ascending into the erupting ﬁlament. All together,
these observations vindicate recent predictions of the 3D standard solar ﬂare model.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares and eruptions are the brightest and the
most violent manifestations of solar magnetic activ-
ity (Fletcher et al. 2011; Schmieder et al. 2015). The
well-known 2D CSKHP standard solar ﬂare model
(Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp
& Pneuman 1976) was recently extended into three
dimensions (3D) by Aulanier et al. (2012, 2013) and
Janvier et al. (2013, 2015). The 3D model successfully
underwent a series of observational tests and explained
many inherently 3D ﬂare phenomena, such as the shape
of ﬂare ribbons and their hooks, relationship of these J-

shaped ribbons to electric currents (Janvier et al. 2014)
and apparent slipping motion of ﬂare loops (Dud´ık et al.
2014, 2016; Li & Zhang 2014, 2015; Li et al. 2016), as
well as the existence of the vortices at the ﬂanks of
the erupting magnetic ﬂux rope (Zuccarello et al. 2017;
Dud´ık et al. 2017), and eruption-induced changes in the
surface magnetic ﬁeld (Barczynski et al. 2019).

Recently, Aulanier & Dud´ık (2019) found that, in ad-
dition to the standard reconnection between coronal ar-
cades a, which builds the ﬂux rope r and creates ﬂare
loops f as described in the CSHKP model, denoted as
the aa–rf reconnection, new reconnection geometries can
also exist in three dimensions. The erupting ﬂux rope r
also undergoes reconnections with the surrounding coro-
nal arcades a, leading to creation of new rope ﬁeld lines
r and ﬂare loops f. This purely 3D ar–rf reconnec-
tion geometry erodes the ﬂux rope on the inner side,

where the straight part of the ﬂare ribbon curves into
its hooked section (see Figure 5 in Aulanier & Dud´ık
2019). This erosion of the rope on the inner side hap-
pens as the straight parts of the ribbons move outward.
Simultaneously, the hooks of the ribbons drift, and the
coronal arcades located previously on the outer edges of
the hooks become new ﬂux rope ﬁeld lines. This process
leads to drifting of the ﬂux rope footpoints during the
course of the eruption, in spite of the line-tying of the
ﬂux rope footpoints Aulanier & Dud´ık (2019). Finally,
the existence of the ar–rf reconnection means that ﬂare
loops rooted at the ends of the straight parts of J-shaped
ribbons are not formed by the same reconnection geom-
etry as the remainder of ﬂare loops within the same ﬂare
arcade, whose genesis is the standard aa–rf reconnection
between coronal arcades.

In addition to that, Aulanier & Dud´ık (2019) pre-
dicted the existence of the rr–rf reconnection: When
the eruption is well underway, the internal, near-vertical
legs of the erupting magnetic ﬂux rope reconnect to cre-
ate a new, multi-turn ﬂux rope ﬁeld line and a ﬂare loop.
The footpoints of the ﬁeld lines involved in the rr–rf re-
connection are located near the tips of the ﬂare ribbon
hooks. The rr–rf reconnection leads to increase of the
poloidal ﬂux of the erupting ﬂux rope.

While the standard aa–rf reconnection has been ob-
served in several events either as coronal inﬂows (e.g.,
Yokoyama et al. 2001; Zhu et al. 2016) or as apparently
slipping ﬂare loops (e.g., Dud´ık et al. 2014), the only
evidence for ar–rf reconnection as presented in Aulanier
& Dud´ık (2019) relied only on ribbon deformation. In
the works of Zemanova et al. (2019) and L¨orinˇc´ık et al.
(2019), the evidence was incomplete, as only some of the
four components of the ar–rf reconnection were visible.
In L¨orinˇc´ık et al. (2019), footpoints of an erupting ﬁla-
ment were swept by the ribbon hook and turned to ﬂare
loops, a signature of the ar–rf reconnection. Zemanova
et al. (2019) observed signiﬁcant drift of a ribbon hook
in another event, followed by complex evolution of this
hook, consistent with the ar–rf reconnection. As for the
rr–rf reconnection, to our knowledge, the evidence for
this reconnection geometry is wholly missing. Here, we
report on the occurrence of both ar–rf and rr–rf recon-
nections in the ﬁlament eruption of 2011 June 07. The
event is presented in Section 2. Sections 3 and 4 de-
tail observations of the ar–rf and rr–rf reconnections,
respectively. Conclusions are given in Section 5.

2. THE FILAMENT ERUPTION OF 2011 JUNE 07

The ﬁlament eruption studied here occurred within
the active region NOAA 11226 (hereafter, AR 11226),
see also Figure 1c). The AR is the westernmost part of

a larger complex of ARs, including AR 11227 and small
AR 11233 between them. The eruption involved an un-
usually massive ﬁlament (van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2014)
which became the bright core of a 3-part CME (Howard
et al. 2017).
It was associated with a long-duration
M2.5–class ﬂare that started at ≈06:08 UT, reached the
impulsive phase at 06:27 UT, and exhibited a broad peak
around 06:41 UT (Figure 1a). The Solar Object Locator
for this event is SOL2011-06-07T06:24:00.

The eruption is a well-known event. Inglis & Gilbert
(2013) studied the motion of hard X-ray emission within
the ﬂare ribbons. van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. (2014) stud-
ied the reconnections between the erupting ﬁlament and
the neighboring ARs within the AR complex, occurring
well after the peak phase of the ﬂare. Yardley et al.
(2016) investigated the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld
and found that strong ﬂux cancellations contributed to
the buildup of this large ﬁlament. Properties of ﬁla-
ment blobs, some of which were falling back to the Sun,
were investigated by Innes et al. (2012), Williams et al.
(2013), Carlyle et al. (2014), and Thompson & Young
(2016); the impacts themselves by Gilbert et al. (2013),
Reale et al. (2014), and Innes et al. (2016). Bright ﬁla-
ment ejecta in the outer corona were studied by Susino
et al. (2015), Wood et al. (2016), and Mishra et al.
(2018). However, none of these studies dealt with the
initial and impulsive phases of the eruption, and the
accompanying reconnection in the low corona at these
times.

To do that, we use the imaging data from the At-
mospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA Lemen et al. 2012)
onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO Pesnell
et al. 2012). AIA provides full-Sun observations in 10
spectral channels covering wide range of temperatures,
from the photosphere to the corona. Its spatial resolu-
tion is 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 with a pixel size of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6. Hot ﬂare emission is
documented in the 94 ˚A and 131 ˚A channels (O’Dwyer
et al. 2010). The coronal environment is observed in
171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, and 335 ˚A. In these ﬁlters, the ﬁl-
ament is visible as a dark structure due to the absorp-
tion by H and He continua (e.g., Heinzel et al. 2008;
Williams et al. 2013). The ﬂare ribbons are observed
in the 1600 ˚A channel containing C IV emission (Lemen
et al. 2012; Sim˜oes et al. 2019) originating in the tran-
sition region.

The ﬁlament eruption in AIA 193 ˚A is shown in Figure
1. At 06:15 UT (panel b), the ﬁlament is already rising.
Ribbon brightenings can be discerned near its southern
leg at [X,Y ] ≈ [675(cid:48)(cid:48),−390(cid:48)(cid:48)]. This ﬁlament leg is overlaid
by a multitude of closed coronal loops anchored in the
vicinity. Towards the impulsive phase, at 06:25 UT, the
ﬁlament undergoes a full eruption. Prominent ﬂare rib-

NRH1 and NRH2. The conjugate ribbon PR and its
hook PRH are also discernible.

During the eruption, many of the ﬁlament strands
have brightened, and are visible both in 193 ˚A and
1600 ˚A (panels d–e). Near the peak of the ﬂare at
06:35 UT, the ﬁlament is already escaping the Sun. Its
darkening is probably a combination of decreased AIA
193 ˚A exposure time and removal of foreground emis-
sion during the eruption. The growing arcade of bright
ﬂare loops is evident in 193 ˚A (panel f). PR and NR
spread away, with the straight NR closing NRH1 (panel
g). The closing of NRH1 is accompanied by a drift of
the southern leg of the ﬁlament to NRH2. At 06:35 UT,
it is at position [X,Y ] ≈ [675(cid:48)(cid:48),−365(cid:48)(cid:48)], a shift of about
25(cid:48)(cid:48) northward. Note that this happens well before the
reconnection of the erupting ﬁlament with surround-
ing ARs, which occurs only at ≈07:00 UT (van Driel-
Gesztelyi et al. 2014).

3. AR–RF RECONNECTION DURING THE

ERUPTION

To test whether the observed drift of the ﬁlament leg
could be due to the ar–rf reconnection predicted by
Aulanier & Dud´ık (2019), we study the AIA observa-
tions of both the ﬂare and surrounding corona.

3.1. Ribbon evolution

We ﬁrst examine the evolution of the ribbons and their
hooks. The AIA 1600 ˚A observations at 06:21, 06:27,
and 06:36 UT are shown in Figure 2. These times cover
the early, impulsive, and peak phases of the ﬂare, re-
spectively. The ribbons become well-visible after about
06:18 UT. Initially, NR and PR are close together near
the polarity inversion line (PIL). They subsequently sep-
arate with relative velocity of about 26 km s−1. This sep-

the NR and NRH1–2 at 06:21, 06:27, and 06:33 UT. Colored
circles denote the locations shown in Figures 4 and 5.

bons are observed nearby (panels d–e). The 1600 ˚A im-
age together with the SDO/HMI (Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager) line-of-sight magnetogram (Scherrer et al.
2012) shows that the southern leg of the ﬁlament is lo-
cated in the negative polarity, and is encircled by a hook
NRH1 of the negative ribbon NR. In addition, a second
hook NRH2 is present, located further north (Figure 1e).
In reality, both NRH1 and NRH2 are likely a part of a
single hook, deformed by the presence of other active
regions east of it (see Figure 1c and Figures 9b,d; 10a
of van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2014). We will neverthe-
less refer to the observed morphology and use the labels

2. The colored circles denote footpoints of individual reconnecting structures. The label ’a’ stands for arcade, ’r’ for ﬂux rope,
and ’f’ for ﬂare loop. Yellow arrow in panel b depict ﬂare loops rooted at the outer edge of NRH1.

Figure 5. Evolution of the overlying corona as seen in the 171 ˚A and 193 ˚A RD images (a–g). The color scale is saturated to
±150 DN s−1, with light (dark) colors indicating increase (decrease) of emission. Green arrows denote a reconnecting coronal
loop, whose footpoint is shown by the green circle denoted ’a’ (see Section 3.3). Panel h shows the zoomed-in original 171 ˚A image
at 06:21:50 UT. The location of the NRH2 at three times, corresponding to Figure 2a, are overlaid by colored lines.

aration causes NR to drift into NRH1, narrowing it (Fig-
ure 2a), since the outer edge of NRH1 does not move.

A composite image of the ribbon evolution at the three
times of Figure 2b–d is shown in panel a, using blue,
green, and red colors for 06:21, 06:27, and 06:36 UT,
respectively. In addition, Figure 3 shows the zoomed-

in manual tracing of the shape of NRH1–2 at these
three times. The ribbon tracing is done analogously to
Aulanier & Dud´ık (2019, Figure 7e–f therein). We note
that the tracing is only approximate due to ﬁnite width
of the ribbon, varying intensity along it, and local sat-
uration. The uncertainty is estimated to be at least the

is the same as analyzed in Aulanier & Dud´ık (2019). The QSL footprints in the model (where the squashing factor Q(z = 0)
reaches its maximum values), corresponding to ﬂare ribbons, are shown by black. Selected ﬁeld lines from the model are shown
during (a) at the onset of the eruption, and (b) during the eruption. The footpoints near the hook are ﬁxed and denoted by
circles.
AIA resolution of ±1.(cid:48)(cid:48)5, and is larger within saturated
areas.

Figures 2 and 3 show that the evolution of the NRH2
is a complex one. It expands between 06:21–06:27 UT
(blue–green), then changes shape as its curved part
(elbow) moves further west at 06:36 UT (red; Figure
2a). Similarly to the ﬂares investigated previously by
Aulanier & Dud´ık (2019) and Zemanova et al. (2019),
there exists an area (around X = 670(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = −365(cid:48)(cid:48))
which is outside of the ﬂux rope (NRH2) at 06:21 UT,
then inside the ﬂux rope at 06:27 UT, but is again out-
side of if at 06:36 UT. In line with previous works, this
suggests probable sequences of ar–rf reconnections in the
framework of the model predictions (Aulanier & Dud´ık
2019).

3.2. Evolution of ﬁlament and ﬂare loops

We next examined the evolution of the ﬂare itself.
Flare emission is well-observed in AIA 131 ˚A and 94 ˚A,
both of which show the same morphology of ﬂare loops.
The ﬂare emission is detected as early as 06:08 UT and
comes primarily from the ribbon hooks. Here, we focus
on NRH1 and NRH2, since PRH is largely obscured by
the erupting ﬁlament. Figure 4 shows the evolution of
the ﬂare emission in 131 ˚A. The location of the southern
leg of the ﬁlament is also evident as a dark, evolving
structure in this passband. Early in the ﬂare, the leg
of the rising ﬁlament in NRH1 is ﬂanked on it southern
edge by ﬂare loops. To better identify the initial ﬁlament
footpoint, the 131 ˚A image at 06:15 UT was replaced by
the 171 ˚A one, which does not contain the ﬂare emission.
The ﬁlament footpoint there is denoted by red circle ’r’.

At 06:21 UT (Figure 4b), the evolving ﬂare loops en-
velop the ﬁlament leg. Some of these ﬂare loops are
pointed out by yellow arrow. The ﬂare loops rooted in
NRH1 slip along its outer edge with apparent speeds of
about 23 ± 3 km s−1 (see animation accompanying Fig-
ure 4). At 06:27 UT, the original position of the ﬁlament
leg, denoted by red circle (Figure 4c), no longer cor-
responds to the ﬁlament leg, but to footpoints of ﬂare
loops ’f’ within a growing ﬂare loop arcade. The ﬁlament
leg itself drifts northward: In Figure 4c, the ﬁlament leg
is already located to the north of the red circle. We note
that the drift itself is not easy to follow, for example in a
time-distance plot, due to many overlapping structures,
as well as saturation and diﬀraction from bright ﬂare
loops, and changes in AIA exposure times. However, at
about 06:36 UT, the ﬁlament footpoint clearly reached
NRH2 (Figure 4d), more than 25(cid:48)(cid:48) northward. This shift
is much larger than the AIA resolution. Furthermore,
the ﬁlament leg in NRH2 is not overlapped by the bright
ﬂare arcade, permitting its unambiguous identiﬁcation.
In Figure 4d, the new position of the ﬁlament leg inside
NRH2 is marked by violet circle ’r’.

Inspecting the surrounding coronal emission, we ﬁnd
that before the ﬂare, at 06:15 UT, the location of the
violet circle corresponded to a footpoint of a faint coro-
nal loop seen in 171 ˚A, denoted again by a violet cir-
cle and letter ’a’. Thus, for the ﬁrst time, we identify
all four constituents of the 3D ar–rf reconnection: The
original rope ’r’ reconnects with a coronal arcade ’a’ to
become a ﬂare loop ’f’ and a new rope ﬁeld line ’r’. The
temporal gap between the occurrence of the ﬂare loop
(06:27 UT) and the new position of the ﬁlament leg in

observed by AIA 94 ˚A. Orange arrows show the newly-formed ﬂare loop, while the white arrow denote a bright blob ascending
into the erupting ﬁlament. The starting points of the arrows are kept the same.
(An animation of this Figure is available.)

NRH2 (06:36 UT) could be explained by the time the
ﬁlament material needs to fall back from high altitudes
where it was carried during the eruption. Note that van
Driel-Gesztelyi et al. (2014) shown that falling ﬁlament
material can fall down at locations initially unconnected
to the eruption by means of reconnections with loops
from neighboring active regions. Here, the mechanism
is analogous, but occurs earlier during the eruption, and
within the same erupting active region.

The locations of the red and violet circles, where the
footpoints of the constituents of the ar–rf reconnection
are rooted, are also shown in Figure 2a with respect
to NRH1 and NRH2.
It is seen that the red circle is
swept by the outward motion of NR away from the PIL,
in agreement with this location becoming a ﬂare loop.
Meanwhile, the violet circle enters the growing NRH2
and stays inside, in agreement with this location becom-
ing a footpoint of a ﬂux rope ﬁeld line (Aulanier & Dud´ık
2019, and references therein). We note that in this ﬂare,
the time the ribbon sweeps a particular feature can be
diﬃcult to identify, owing to the ﬁnite AIA resolution of
1.(cid:48)(cid:48)5. This uncertainty is translated into uncertainties of

identiﬁcation of both the footpoint locations as well as
the ribbon.

3.3. Reconnection of overlying coronal loops

Although in Section 3.2 we identify the four con-
stituents of the ar–rf reconnection, there is a multi-
tude of coronal loops overlying the ﬁlament, some of
which may also reconnect with the ﬁlament. Identifying
such reconnecting loops is however not an easy task,
since the coronal loops can be faint in 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A,
and 211 ˚A (hundreds of DN s−1) compared to the back-
ground and especially the ﬂare. The overall evolution
of coronal loops is nevertheless visible in the running-
diﬀerence (hereafter, “RD”) images, constructed with a
time delay of 48 s. We chose such delay to avoid the
AIA exposure control aﬀecting every second exposure,
and to enhance motion of structures compared to a 24 s
diﬀerence.

A series of 171 ˚A and 193 ˚A RD images is shown in Fig-
ure 5. These RD images are saturated to ±150 DN s−1,
with the conventional color scaling, where light and dark
colors indicate increase and decrease of emission, respec-
It is readily seen that there are many overly-
tively.

ing loops which exhibit motions during the eruption.
However, not all of the loops reconnect with the ﬁla-
ment: Some constitute the compression front (visible at
06:24 UT at X ≈ 650(cid:48)(cid:48); Figure 5c). Nevertheless, a series
of reconnection-candidate loops rooted near NRH2 can
be identiﬁed. Due to many overlapping structures, the
identiﬁcation of their footpoints is not straightforward.
One prominent example loop is however pointed out by
green arrow, while its footpoint is denoted by green cir-
cle. At 06:21 UT, the upper portion of this loop is better
visible in the 193 ˚A RD image, while its lower leg is more
intense in 171 ˚A RD (Figure 5b, f). Examination of the
171 ˚A emission at this time (panel h) reveals that the
footpoint of this loop is located at the outer edge of
NRH2. However, at 06:36 UT, this location resides in-
side NRH2, i.e., inside the ﬂux rope. This means that
the corresponding coronal loop has reconnected. RD
images reveal that after 06:21 UT, the loop contracts
towards the erupting ﬁlament (panels c and g), and is
no longer discernible at 06:28 UT (panel d).

The footpoint location of this loop (green circle) with
respect to the ribbons is also shown in Figure 2a. At
06:21 UT (blue), it is located on the opposite side of
NHR2 compared to the violet circle. Thus, loops from
both sides of the growing NRH2 reconnect with the
erupting ﬂux rope. This is consistent with the recent
extensions to the 3D model as analyzed in Aulanier &
Dud´ık (2019) from one MHD simulation of Zuccarello
et al. (2015): Initially, the footpoints of the coronal ar-
cades surround the hook (blue in Figure 6a), while the
erupting ﬂux rope (pink) is rooted inside the hook. The
ﬁxed footpoints of the ﬁeld lines plotted are in Figure 6
shown by circles. As the eruption progresses, the hook
grows, while the straight part of the ribbon moves away
from the PIL. The footpoints of the previous ﬂux rope
ﬁeld lines become footpoints of the ﬂare loops (pink in
Figure 6b), while the footpoints of arcades turn to foot-
points of the ﬂux rope (blue). Note however that in
the model, there is only one ribbon hook, while in our
event, the NRH1 and NRH2 are likely parts of a single
deformed hook (see Section 2). Finally, the evolution of
ribbons due to the ar–rf reconnection geometry is also
captured by the cartoon presented in Figure 2 of Ze-
manova et al. (2019).

Note also that in our event, the ﬁlament itself did not
seem to reach the location of the green circle as the ﬁeld
lines in Figure 6 do. The ﬁlament itself likely does not
represent the entirety of the erupting ﬂux rope, since ﬁl-
aments are only located in the lower, dipped portions of
long, ﬂat, sheared, or twisted ﬁeld lines (e.g., Gibson &
Fan 2006; Dud´ık et al. 2008; Luna et al. 2012; Zuccarello
et al. 2016; Xia & Keppens 2016; Gibson 2018; Gun´ar

et al. 2018), while the rest of the ﬂux rope may not be
readily apparent in observations. However, as the green
circle is located in a coronal dimming region (compare
Figure 2a with 4d), the corresponding coronal loop likely
reconnected with a ﬂux rope ﬁeld line not made visible
in observations by absorbing ﬁlament plasma.

4. LATE RR–RF RECONNECTION
UNDER THE ERUPTING FILAMENT

We also study the occurrence of the rr–rf reconnection
in our event. To do that, we use the AIA 94 ˚A observa-
tions, which show morphology similar to 131 ˚A, but are
less saturated in the impulsive and peak phases of the
ﬂare.

In the impulsive phase, bright ﬁlament strands are ob-
served at the inner side of its legs. At 06:29 UT, a pair
of bright strands start to converge towards one another.
The strand in the northern ﬁlament leg, denoted by red
dotted line, is visible sooner than the conjugate strand
within the southern leg, denoted by orange dotted line
(Figure 7a–c). The convergence of these bright strands
happens directly above the ﬂare arcade and lasts until
about 06:31:20 UT (panel d). Although an X-type ge-
ometry is suggestive, this is not an inﬂow of coronal ma-
terial (aa–rf reconnection) as reported previously (e.g.,
Yokoyama et al. 2001; Zhu et al. 2016). At 06:31:20 UT,
a bright new ﬂare loop appears above the ﬂare arcade,
retracting slightly with time (orange arrow in Figure 7f–
h). Finally, a bright blob, a remnant of the upper part
of the reconnecting southern bright strand, is seen as-
cending into the ﬁlament (white arrows), while the rest
of the strand disappears completely (panel f).

Based on the timing and the observed morphology,
both of which are consistent with the predictions of the
3D extensions to the standard model, we conclude that
we observe the rr–rf reconnection: In accordance with
the model, the rr–rf reconnection happens only when
the eruption is well developed, i.e., the ﬂux rope legs
are stretched vertically on both sides of the central part
of the ﬂaring PIL.

Since the new ﬂare loops resulting from the rr–rf re-
connection are formed above the existing ﬂare arcade,
we speculate that the rr–rf reconnection could be a can-
didate source for the supra-arcade downﬂowing loops
(e.g., Savage et al. 2012b,a). Note that we do not observe
any supra-arcades in this event to unfavorable on-disk
geometry.

5. SUMMARY

We analyze SDO/AIA imaging observations of the ﬁl-
ament eruption of 2011 June 07 and report on signatures
of the theoretically predicted 3D ar–rf and rr–rf recon-
nection geometries (Aulanier & Dud´ık 2019) involving

the erupting ﬂux rope. These reconnection geometries
are found in the well-known eruption of a solar ﬁlament
observed on 2011 June 07.

According to the theoretical predictions, in the ar–rf
reconnection geometry, the erupting magnetic ﬂux rope
r reconnects with a coronal arcade a to produce a new
ﬂux rope ﬁeld line r and a ﬂare loop f. In our event,
the ar–rf reconnection manifests itself in several ways.
First, the ﬁlament leg shifts its position by more than
25(cid:48)(cid:48) northward, to a position previously occupied by a
footpoint of a coronal arcade (loop), while the original
position of the ﬁlament leg becomes a ﬂare loop. The
ar–rf reconnection is also associated with the evolution
of the ﬂare ribbons and their hooks: as the straight part
of the observed ribbon moves away from the polarity in-
version line, it narrows down the hook from the inside.
Meanwhile the hook is growing, and footpoints of sev-
eral coronal arcades from both sides of the hook NRH2
become inside the hook. All this is consistent with the
evolution of the ribbon hook in the 3D extensions to the
standard solar ﬂare model.

The rr–rf reconnection geometry involves two legs of
the erupting ﬂux rope r and produces a new ﬂare loop
f and a new ﬂux rope ﬁeld line r. In our event, the ob-
served signatures of the rr–rf reconnection consist of the
convergence of two bright ﬁlament strands in an appar-
ently X-type geometry. This convergence is followed by
disappearance of the converging strands and appearance
of a new ﬂare loop near the leg of the southern strand,
while a bright blob, a remnant of one of the strands, is
observed to be ascending into the ﬁlament.

Thus, for the ﬁrst time, both types of reconnections
are identiﬁed in a single event and in a complete manner,
with all four constituents of both the ar–rf and rr–rf re-
connections being visible. These observations and their
locations are consistent with the recent predictions of 3D
extensions to the standard solar ﬂare model (Aulanier
& Dud´ık 2019). Further support for these theoretical
results comes from the observed timing with relation to

the evolution of the ﬂare. The ar–rf reconnection occurs
before the fast eruption and the impulsive phase of the
ﬂare, while the rr–rf occurs during the peak phase under
the erupting ﬁlament. These observations show that the
early to peak phases of an eruption are much richer and
varied in the reconnection geometries than previously
realized, with consequences for evolution of CMEs.

These observations of the 3D reconnection geometries,
together with the evidences for ar–rf reconnection pre-
sented by Zemanova et al. (2019) and L¨orinˇc´ık et al.
(2019), represent the latest successful tests of the predic-
tions of the 3D extensions to the standard ﬂare model.
Together with the previous ones (Dud´ık et al. 2014,
2016, 2017; Zuccarello et al. 2017; Aulanier & Dud´ık
2019), these observational tests contribute to the theo-
retical advancements in the study of the nature of solar
ﬂares and eruptions. They also provide new tools to link
interplanetary CME ﬂux ropes with their footpoints at
the Sun’s surface, in the context of the upcoming Solar
Orbiter mission.
