ABSTRACT

Context. Solar active region (AR) 12673 in 2017 September produced the two largest ﬂares in Solar Cycle 24: the X9.3 ﬂare on
September 6 and the X8.2 ﬂare on September 10.
Aims. We attempt to investigate the evolutions of the two large ﬂares and their associated complex magnetic system in detail.
Methods. Combining observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and results of nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) modeling,
we identify various magnetic structures in the AR core region and examine the evolution of these structures during the ﬂares.
Results. Aided by the NLFFF modeling, we identify a double-decker ﬂux rope conﬁguration above the polarity inversion line (PIL)
in the AR core region. The north ends of these two ﬂux ropes were rooted in a negative- polarity magnetic patch, which began to move
along the PIL and rotate anticlockwise before the X9.3 ﬂare on September 6. The strong shearing motion and rotation contributed to
the destabilization of the two magnetic ﬂux ropes, of which the upper one subsequently erupted upward due to the kink-instability.
Then another two sets of twisted loop bundles beside these ropes were disturbed and successively erupted within ﬁve minutes like a
chain reaction. Similarly, multiple ejecta components were detected as consecutively erupting during the X8.2 ﬂare occurring in the
same AR on September 10. We examine the evolution of the AR magnetic ﬁelds from September 3 to 6 and ﬁnd that ﬁve dipoles
emerged successively at the east of the main sunspot. The interactions between these dipoles took place continuously, accompanied
by magnetic ﬂux cancellations and strong shearing motions.
Conclusions. In AR 12673, signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence and successive interactions between the diﬀerent emerging dipoles resulted
in a complex magnetic system, accompanied by the formations of multiple ﬂux ropes and twisted loop bundles. We propose that the
eruptions of a multi-ﬂux-rope system resulted in the two largest ﬂares in Solar Cycle 24.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂares are explosive phenomena on the Sun that can be ob-
served from X-ray to radio wavelengths, and that release dra-
matic free magnetic energy stored in the solar atmosphere via
the process of magnetic reconnection (Priest & Forbes 2002;
Schmieder et al. 2015). In previous studies, the accumulation
of free magnetic energy in the solar atmosphere is demonstrated
to be mainly caused by three types of mechanisms: (1) magnetic
ﬂux emergence or cancellation (Wang & Shi 1993; Chen & Shi-
bata 2000; Zhang et al. 2001; Sterling et al. 2010; Louis et al.
2015), (2) shearing motion (Wang et al. 1994; Meunier & Koso-
vichev 2003; Sun et al. 2012), (3) sunspot rotation (Brown et al.
2003; Zhang et al. 2007; Török et al. 2013). Although the energy
accumulation has been investigated thoroughly, it is diﬃcult for
us to comprehend the detailed process of violent energy release
in various solar eruptions. Because it is widely accepted that
magnetic ﬂux ropes play key roles in triggering eruptive events
(Amari et al. 2000; Fan 2005; Kliem et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2010;
Green et al. 2011; Li et al. 2016; Yan et al. 2017), we can under-
stand these eruptive events such as solar ﬂares and coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) through studying magnetic ﬂux ropes.

A magnetic ﬂux rope is a set of magnetic ﬁeld lines winding
around a central axis in classical eruptive ﬂare models and many
CME observations. A huge amount of eﬀort has been made in

numerical simulations of the formation and dynamic activity of
ﬂux ropes (Forbes & Priest 1995; Aulanier et al. 2010). Amari et
al. (2000, 2003) simulated the evolution of a ﬂux rope and pro-
posed that a slow converging motion of the footpoints of ﬁeld
lines toward the polarity inversion line (PIL) contributed to the
formation of a ﬂux rope through magnetic reconnection. With
high-resolution observations, the existence of ﬂux ropes in the
solar atmosphere has also been recently evidenced (Guo et al.
2010, 2013; Cheng et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2014; Kumar et al.
2017; Guglielmino et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2017a; Yan et al.
2018a; Shen et al. 2018). Zhang et al. (2012) reported a ﬂux
rope observed as a hot extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channel before
and during the solar eruption and proposed that the instability
of this ﬂux rope triggered the eruption. Li & Zhang (2013a) in-
vestigated the successive eruptions of two ﬂux ropes during an
M-class ﬂare. Li & Zhang (2013b) presented four homologous
ﬂux ropes, which were formed successively at the same loca-
tion in an active region (AR). These observations imply that ﬂux
ropes may be ubiquitous on the Sun (Zhang et al. 2015; Hou et
al. 2016). In the present work, a magnetic ﬂux rope is deﬁned
as a set of magnetic ﬁeld lines winding around a central axis by
more than one full turn (Liu et al. 2016). Then aided by non-
linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) modeling and the calculation of

10. Here we investigate the evolutions of the two large ﬂares and
the associated complex magnetic system in detail.

Flux ropes are often related to various magnetohydrody-
namic (MHD) instability processes, which eventually trigger so-
lar ﬂares and CMEs (Alexander et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2007; Ku-
mar & Cho 2014). Kink MHD instability is triggered by the
azimuthal twist of magnetic tubes. Numerical simulations of
the kink instability suggest that if the twist of a ﬂux rope ex-
ceeds a critical value, then this rope becomes unstable (Kliem
et al. 2004). The exact value of required twist depends on vari-
ous factors such as loop geometry and overlying magnetic ﬁelds
(Hood & Priest 1979; Baty 2001; Fan & Gibson 2004; Leka et
al. 2005). In addition, observations of kink instability were re-
ported recently by many authors (Srivastava et al. 2010; Wang et
al. 2017b).

From 2017 September 4 to September 10, AR 12673 pro-
duced a total of 4 X-class ﬂares, 27 M-class ﬂares, and a mul-
titude of smaller ones (see the details in Yang et al. 2017). The
X9.3 ﬂare on September 6 is the largest ﬂare in Solar Cycle 24
and has been reported in several works (Wang et al. 2018; Verma
2018; Shen et al. 2018; Yan et al. 2018b; Jiang et al. 2018).
In this work, we identify a double-decker ﬂux rope conﬁgura-
tion above the PIL in the AR core region and detect successive
eruptions of multiple ﬂux ropes and twisted loop bundles within
ﬁve minutes before the peak of this large ﬂare. A similar phe-
nomenon was also observed during the X8.2 ﬂare on September

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section
2 contains the observations and data analysis taken in our study.
The detailed process of the two ﬂares and the evolution of the
magnetic ﬁelds in the AR core region are presented in Sect. 3.
Finally, in Sect. 4 we conclude this work and discuss the results.

2. Observations and data analysis

On 2017 September 6, an X9.3 ﬂare took place in NOAA AR
12673, which was the largest ﬂare in Solar Cycle 24. About four
days later, another X8.2 ﬂare happened in the same AR when
the AR rotated to the solar southwestern limb on September 10.
The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012)
on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al.
2012) successively observes multilayered solar atmosphere in
ten (E)UV passbands with a cadence of (12)24 s and a spatial
resolution of 1.′′2. The SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Schou et al. 2012) provides one-arcsecond resolution full-
disk line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms and intensitygrams ev-
ery 45 s, and photospheric vector magnetograms at a cadence of
720 s (Hoeksema et al. 2014). Here we employ the data of AIA
94 Å, 171 Å, 304 Å, HMI LOS magnetograms, intensitygrams
and the HMI data product called Space-weather HMI Active Re-
gion Patches (SHARP; Bobra et al. 2014) for the investigation of

the X9.3 ﬂare on September 6. The AIA 131 Å and 171 Å images
are used to study the X8.2 ﬂare on September 10. Moreover, the
observations from the Geostationary Operational Environmen-
tal Satellite (GOES) are also used to present the variation of soft
X-ray (SXR) 1-8 Å ﬂux from September 3 to September 11.

The AIA and HMI observations used in the X9.3 ﬂare are
all derotated to the reference time of 12:02 UT on September
6, and the AIA data of the X8.2 ﬂare are aligned to 16:06 UT
on September 10. To investigate the evolution of magnetic ﬁelds
in AR 12673 before the onset of the X9.3 ﬂare, we employ the
HMI LOS magnetograms and intensitygrams from September
3 to September 6 and derotate them to a middle time of 00:00

UT on September 05. To determine the horizontal photospheric
velocities, we apply the method of diﬀerential aﬃne velocity es-
timator (DAVE; Schuck 2006). The window size in DAVE is set
as 19 pixels, following the parameter given in Liu et al. (2013).

In order to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) coronal
structure in the target region, we utilize the “weighted optimiza-
tion" method to perform NLFFF extrapolation (Wiegelmann
2004; Wiegelmann et al. 2012) based on the observed photo-
spheric vector magnetic ﬁelds. To satisfy the force-free con-
dition, the vector magnetograms are preprocessed by a proce-
dure developed by Wiegelmann et al. (2006) towards suitable
photospheric boundary conditions. The calculation is performed

within a box of 512 × 448 × 256 uniform grid points (186 ×
162 × 93 Mm3), which covers nearly the entire AR. We further
calculate the twist number Tw (Berger & Prior 2006) of the ex-
trapolated ﬁeld using the code developed by R. Liu and J. Chen
(Liu et al. 2016).

3. Results

3.1. Overview of AR 12673

When AR 12673 approached the solar center on September 03,
signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence commenced in this region and per-
sisted for the following several days (Sun & Norton 2017). Be-
fore disappearing completely in the west solar limb on Septem-
ber 11, AR 12673 produced a total of 4 X-class ﬂares, 27 M-
class ﬂares, and numerous smaller ones. Figure 1(a) shows the
GOES SXR 1-8 Å ﬂux variation from September 3 to September
11, and four X-class ﬂares are denoted. The orange and green re-
gions in panel (a) respectively mark the two largest ﬂares in Solar
Cycle 24: the X9.3 ﬂare on September 6 and the X8.2 ﬂare on
September 10. In AIA 94 Å channel, the X9.3 ﬂare performed
complex structures accompanied by intense emission enhance-
ment (panel (b)). This ﬂare started around 11:53 UT and peaked
at 12:02 UT when the AR was centered around S09W34. Pan-
els (c) and (d) show the HMI continuum intensitygram and LOS
magnetogram of the AR at the onset of the ﬂare.

3.2. The X9.3 ﬂare on September6

Based on the photospheric vector magnetograms observed by
SDO/HMI, we extrapolated the 3D structure of the AR using
NLFFF modeling at 11:24 UT on September 6, just before the
occurrence of the X9.3 ﬂare. For visualizations of the magnetic

ﬁeld above the region of interest, we select a region from the
NLFFF extrapolation, with an FOV approximated by the white
box in Fig. 1(d), to display in Fig. 2. Moreover, we calculate
the twist number Tw of the reconstructed ﬁeld and then we can
obtain the photospheric twist map or vertical twist map in the
selected cutting plane. According to the photospheric twist map
and the deﬁnition of magnetic ﬂux rope mentioned in Sect. 1,
we plot the ﬁeld lines across the photosphere where the |Tw| ≧
1.0 near the PIL in the AR core region. As a result, we obtain
two magnetic ﬂux ropes with Tw ≦ –1.0, of which the upper
one (FR2) is located right above the lower one (FR1), forming a
double-decker ﬂux rope conﬁguration (Liu et al. 2012). Figures
2(a) and 2(b) show the top view and side view of the double-
decker ﬂux rope conﬁguration, respectively. The background is
the photospheric vertical magnetic ﬁeld (Bz). Panel (c) exhibits
the isosurfaces of Tw=–1 (white) and Tw=–1.75 (red) above the
PIL from the top view. It is clear that the isosurface of Tw=–1
roughly outlines the two ﬂux ropes and the |Tw| around the axes
of the two ﬂux ropes is beyond 1.75. Along the green cut marked
in panel (c), we make a twist map in the vertical (x-z) plane and
show it in panel (d). One can see that there are two regions with
high negative twist number in this vertical twist map, which cor-
respond to the cross sections of the two ﬂux ropes.

By examining the AIA 304 Å observations, we detected two
sets of ﬁlament threads located in the AR core region before the
occurrence of the X9.3 ﬂare (see F1 and F2 in Fig. 3(a1) and the
corresponding animation). According to Fig. 2, we suggest that
F1 corresponds to the upper ﬂux rope FR1 and F2 corresponds
to the lower rope FR2. Around 11:53:53 UT, brightening ap-
peared at the north cross site of these two ﬁlament threads (ﬂux
ropes) and continued for several minutes, implying the interac-
tion between rising FR1 and FR2. Then south ends of FR2 and
FR1 brightened in tandem at 11:54:41 UT and 11:54:29 UT, re-

spectively (Figures 3(a2)-3(a3)). At 11:54:41 UT, brightening at
the south cross site of FR1 and FR2 was detected as well. The
two ﬂux ropes then were tracked completely by the brightening
material, and FR2 began to moved upward as well (see panel
(a5)). In panel (a6), we can see that FR2 showed obvious twisted
threads while FR1 had erupted outwards. At 11:56:08 UT, the
writhed structure of FR2 appeared (see panel (a7)). As shown in
Figure 2(c), at 11:24 UT, the maximum |Tw| of FR2 was beyond
1.75, which is the threshold value of kink instability (Török et
al. 2004). Combined with the observations of writhed structure,
the high Tw of FR2 implied the occurrence of kink instability. In
94 Å channel, the two ﬂux ropes were also observed clearly at
11:55:23 UT (panel (b)).

Through checking the HMI data, we notice that the double-
decker ﬂux rope conﬁguration was lying above a semicircular
PIL (see Fig. 4). It is shown that the south ends of the two ﬂux
ropes were rooted in positive magnetic ﬁelds to the southwest
of the PIL, and their north ends in a negative-polarity patch to
the northeast of the PIL. Before the onset of the X9.3 ﬂare, this
negative magnetic patch kept moving northwestward along the
semicircular PIL and successively sheared with the adjacent pos-
itive ﬁelds (see panels (a1)-(a3) and the corresponding anima-
tion). Meanwhile, the HMI continuum intensitygrams reveal that
this negative patch exhibited a counterclockwise rotation motion

(panel (b1)). The shearing motion and rotation of this negative
magnetic patch can be seen clearly in the velocity map of panel
(c). As a result, the twist number of the two ﬂux ropes rooted
in this negative patch could gradually increase, and eventually
approach or exceed the threshold value of kink instability, lead-
ing to the onset of this large ﬂare. Furthermore, when the ﬂare
occurred, a white-light ﬂare can be identiﬁed in the HMI con-
tinuum intensitygram (panel (b2)), and the LOS magnetogram
exhibited magnetic transients as well (panel (a2)).

During the X9.3 ﬂare, we identify a total of two ﬂux ropes
and some twisted loop bundles in the ﬂaring region (see Fig. 5
and the corresponding animation). In 94 Å images of panels (a1)-
(a3), we show the interaction between the kink-unstable FR2 de-
scribed in Figs. 2 and 3, and the nearby loop bundles (LB1). They
are outlined respectively with red dotted and dashed curves. At
11:55:23 UT, FR2 was rising in the northwest direction, ap-
proaching the adjacent LB1. Around 11:56:23 UT, FR2 and LB1
interacted with each other in their middle parts (panel (a2)). Then
LB1 began to rise up rapidly (panel (a3)). In panels (b1)-(b3),
we show LB1 and another set of loop bundles (LB2) with a
larger scale. The green arc-sector domain “A-B” in panel (b1)
is approximately along the erupting directions of FR2 and LB1,
and the domain “C-D” in panel (b3) is in the direction of LB2.
Along the two arc-sector domains, we make two time-space plots

and show them in panels (d1) and (d2), respectively. Panel (d1)
shows that FR2 began to rise upward at about 11:55:30 UT, ac-
companied by the brightening at its base. Around 11:57:30 UT,
FR2 approached LB1 with a projected velocity of ∼280 km s−1,
and then FR2 started to erupt with a speed of ∼380 km s−1. As
shown in panel (d2), LB2 was disturbed around 12:00 UT and
then erupted with a projected velocity of ∼200 km s−1. After
the successive eruptions of multiple ﬂux ropes and twisted loop
bundles, the X9.3 ﬂare reached its peak at 12:02 UT.

In order to verify these structures illuminated in EUV chan-
nels and study their magnetic topologies, we reconstruct 3D
magnetic ﬁeld above the AR and select a larger FOV involv-
ing all the structures mentioned above to show in Fig. 6. Sim-
ilar to the analysis of Fig. 2, after calculating the Tw of the re-
constructed ﬁeld, we plot the ﬁeld lines across the photosphere
where the |Tw| ≧ 1.0 near the PIL in the AR core region and then
get two magnetic ﬂux ropes: the pink FR1 and the red FR2. Re-
setting the ﬁlter value of |Tw| as 0.5, we obtain a set of green
twisted loop bundles beside the FR2, which corresponds to the

sensed images compared with that seen from the top view in the

3.3. The formationand evolutionof the complex magnetic

ﬁelds of AR12673

Successive eruptions of multiple ﬂux ropes and twisted loop bun-
dles during the X9.3 ﬂare implies the existence of a complex
magnetic system in the AR core region. To investigate the for-
mation and evolution of such a complicated magnetic system,
we analyze the HMI observations in AR 12673 (see Fig. 7 and
the corresponding animation). At the initial stage of the AR evo-
lution, there was simply one main sunspot with positive polarity
in the AR center. Then on September 3, one pair of dipolar ﬁelds
emerged to the southeast of the main sunspot (see the “Dipole 1”
in Fig. 5(a)), followed by the emergence of another dipolar re-
gion to the northeast of the main sunspot (see the “Dipole 2”
in panel (b)). After this, the negative and positive patches of
“Dipole 1” separated in the east-west direction, as well as the
patches of “Dipole 2”. Due to the existence of the main sunspot
with strong ﬁelds, the positive patches of these two dipoles were
blocked (Yang et al. 2017). Thus, an elongated positive region
was formed on the east side of the main sunspot (see panel (b)).
Between the negative and positive patches of these two dipoles,
a semicircular channel was formed. Then on September 4, two
pairs of dipolar ﬁelds newly emerged within this semicircular
channel (see the “Dipole 3” and “Dipole 4” in panel (c)), and
their patches with opposite polarities separated along the north-
south axis of the channel. Here we speculate that magnetic re-
connection took place between “Dipole 1” and “Dipole 4”, form-
ing the FR1 and FR2 whose north ends were rooted in the neg-

ative patch of “Dipole 4” and south ends rooted in the positive
patch of “Dipole 1”. A similar process could have occurred be-
tween “Dipole 2” and “Dipole 3” and formed LB2.

The positive patch of “Dipole 3” moved southeastward while
the negative one of “Dipole 4” moved toward the northwest,
which then collided with each other eventually (panel (d)).
Meanwhile, a new bipolar region “Dipole 5” emerged to the west
of the positive patch of “Dipole 3” around September 5. We sug-
gest that part of the loops connecting the opposite patches of
“Dipole 5” would eventually evolve to LB1 due to the rotation of
their footpoints. On September 6, the negative patch of “Dipole
4” quickly intruded into the northwest positive region (see the
green solid arrow in panel (e)), which contributed to enhance-
ment of Tw of FR1 and FR2 and led to the onset of the X9.3 ﬂare
as mentioned in Fig. 4. The velocity ﬁeld in panel (f) derived
from the DAVE method shows that the velocity of the patch’s
motion reached up to ∼0.35 km s−1 at 10:59:04 UT, before the
X9.3 ﬂare’s onset.

3.4. The X8.2 ﬂare on September10

On September 10, an X8.2 ﬂare took place in AR 12673, which
was near the west solar limb. In this event, we also detect multi-
ple ejecta components erupting consecutively and their counter-
parts (twisted structures) before the ﬂare peaked at 16:06 UT (see
Fig. 8 and the corresponding animation). These ejected struc-
tures were observed clearly in the 131 Å channel and separately
denoted by the white, green, and red arrows in panels (a)-(b)).
At about 15:35 UT, the emission at the north end of the twisted
structure denoted by white arrows was enhanced. The bright-
ening propagated southwards and traced out the whole struc-
ture, which kept rising slowly during the following ten minutes.
Around 15:46 UT, another twisted structure marked by green
arrows was illuminated. Then the two structures erupted out-
ward with projected velocities of ∼250 km s−1 and ∼340 km s−1,
respectively (see panel (b)). Meanwhile, one tear-drop-shaped
structure appeared and rapidly moved outward with a velocity

of ∼440 km s−1 (see panel (c)). After the eruption of the tear-
drop-shaped structure, an evident current sheet was formed in
the core region and lasted for several hours (panel (d)). More-
over, the post-ﬂare candle-ﬂame-shaped structure (Guidoni et al.
2015; Gou et al. 2015, 2016) was detected clearly in the 131
Å channel (see panel (e)). In the 171 Å channel, one can see
three groups of post-ﬂare loops with diﬀerent orientations in the
ﬂaring region (see the arrows with diﬀerent colors in panel (f)).
These post-ﬂare loops probably resulted from the eruptions of
the multiple twisted structures mentioned above.

4. Conclusions and discussion

Employing the SDO observations, we investigate the two largest
ﬂares of Solar Cycle 24 occurring in AR 12673 and the evolu-
tion of the AR magnetic ﬁelds. On 2017 September 6, the largest
ﬂare of Solar Cycle 24 took place with its peak intensity reaching
X9.3. Aided by NLFFF modeling, we identify a double-decker
ﬂux rope conﬁguration above the PIL in the AR core region.
The north ends of these two ﬂux ropes were rooted at a neg-
ative magnetic patch, which began to move along the PIL and
kept shearing with adjacent positive ﬁelds before the X9.3 ﬂare
on September 6. The strong shearing motion as well as a con-
tinuous rotation contributed together to the destabilization of the
two magnetic ﬂux ropes. Then the upper ﬂux rope erupted up-

ward due to the kink-instability and led to the successive erup-
tions of another two sets of twisted loop bundles beside the ﬂux
ropes within ﬁve minutes like a chain reaction. Similarly, during
another X8.2 ﬂare occurring on September 10, we also detected
the successive eruptions of multiple ejecta components. The evo-
lution of the AR magnetic ﬁelds shows that ﬁve dipoles emerged
successively at the east of the main sunspot. The interactions
between these dipoles took place continuously, accompanied by
magnetic ﬂux cancellations and strong shearing motions.

Flux ropes have been thought to be closely connected with
CMEs and solar ﬂares (Lin & Forbes 2000; Fan 2005; Liu 2013).
Amari et al. (2000) proposed a model to approach the theory of
CMEs and two-ribbon ﬂares, in which twisted ﬂux ropes play a
crucial role. It was shown that the modeled magnetic conﬁgu-
ration could not stay in equilibrium, and a considerable amount
of magnetic energy was released during the eruption of the ﬂux
rope. Employing high-resolution observations from space plat-
forms, Zhang et al. (2015) detected 1354 ﬂux rope proxies over
the solar disk from 2013 January to 2013 December. Hou et al.
(2016) further implied the existence of multiple ﬂux ropes dur-
ing the evolution of AR 11897. The classical scenario assumes a
single ﬂux rope for each eruption, but it is easy to imagine mul-
tiple ﬂux ropes if the AR is complex and has extended curved
PIL (Liu et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2013; Awasthi
et al. 2018). Török et al. (2011) presented a 3D MHD simulation

to investigate three consecutive ﬁlament eruptions. They consid-
ered a conﬁguration that contains two coronal ﬂux ropes located
within a pseudo-streamer and one rope located next to it. It is
found that a sequence of eruptions was initiated by the eruption
of the ﬂux rope next to the streamer. The expansion of this rope
resulted in two successive reconnection events, each of which
triggered the eruption of a ﬂux rope by reducing the overlying
stabilizing ﬂux. In the observational domain, Shen et al. (2012)
reported the simultaneous occurrence of a partial and a full ﬁl-
ament eruption in two neighboring source regions. Cheng et al.
(2013) investigated successive eruptions of two ﬂux ropes with
an interval of several hours. In the present work, we identify a
double-decker ﬂux rope conﬁguration above the PIL in the AR
core region. The two ﬂux ropes (FR1 and FR2) erupted at the on-
set of the X9.3 ﬂare due to the shearing motion and rotation of
the negative magnetic patch where the ropes were rooted. Then
another two sets of twisted loop bundles (LB1 and LB2) beside
these ropes were disturbed and successively erupted within ﬁve
minutes like a chain reaction. The results from NLFFF modeling
show that the |Tw| of FR1 and FR2 are beyond 1.0 and the |Tw|
of LB1 is beyond 0.5. If we take a lower standard for deﬁning a
magnetic ﬂux rope (e.g., Chintzoglou et al. 2015, who consider a
half turn to be suﬃcient), then LB1 could be regarded as the third
ﬂux rope in this event. Therefore, we propose that the eruptions
of a multi-ﬂux-rope system rapidly released enormous magnetic
energy and led to the X9.3 ﬂare on September 6, the largest ﬂare
in Solar Cycle 24. Similar phenomenon was also observed dur-

ing another X8.2 ﬂare occurring in the same AR several days
later.

In recent years, the concept of double-decker ﬁlament (ﬂux
rope) was proposed by Liu et al. (2012) to explain two vertically
separated ﬁlaments (ﬂux ropes) over the same PIL. The com-
plex conﬁguration of double-decker ﬂux rope was observed and
modeled to exist prior to solar eruptive events (Cheng et al. 2014;
Kliem et al. 2014). Extrapolated NLFFF structures in this work
reveal that before the onset of the X9.3 ﬂare, two magnetic ﬂux
ropes were located separated vertically above the PIL in the AR
core region, forming a typical double-decker ﬂux rope conﬁgu-
ration. At the onset of the X9.3 ﬂare, the strong shearing motion
and rotation of the north ends of the two magnetic ﬂux ropes con-
tributed to their destabilization (Kliem et al. 2004; Srivastava et
al. 2010; Török et al. 2013; Yan et al. 2018b). The brightening at
the cross sites of these two ropes observed in EUV wavelength
indicated the interaction (magnetic reconnection) occurring be-
tween the two ﬂux ropes during their slow-rise phase. The sub-
sequent AIA observations revealed that the lower rope lost its
stability ﬁrst and erupted outwards while the upper ﬂux rope
kept rising upward. Then the upper magnetic ﬂux rope writhed
into a sigmoid shape. The calculation of twist number based on
the NLFFF results shows that the maximum |Tw| of the two ﬂux
ropes were all beyond 1.75 half an hour before the onset of the
ﬂare. It is worth noting that the exact value of twist required of
the kink instability depends on various factors such as the ﬂux
rope geometry and the surrounding magnetic ﬁelds. Török et al.

(2004) proposed that the threshold of instability increases with
rising aspect ratio and the number is 1.75 (3.5 π) at a loop as-
pect ratio R/a ≈ 5, which corresponds to a rather fat ﬂux rope.
Although the double-decker ﬂux ropes in the present work may
have a diﬀerent aspect ratio, we approximate the threshold value
of kink instability to 1.75 here. The facts that the twist of the
ﬂux rope is beyond the threshold value of kink instability and
its conversion into the writhe support the occurrence of the kink
instability during the eruption of the upper ﬂux rope. The erup-
tion of a kink-unstable ﬂux rope during this event has also been
investigated by Yang et al. (2017).

The existence of multiple ﬂux ropes and twisted loop bun-
dles during the two X-class ﬂares reported in the present paper
implies a complicated magnetic system in AR 12673. Examin-
ing the evolution of the magnetic ﬁelds in the AR core region,
we notice that signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence occurred in this region
(Sun & Norton 2017). Five dipoles emerged successively at the
east of the main sunspot. The negative and positive patches of the
ﬁrst two dipoles separated along the east-west direction. How-
ever, the patches of the latter two dipoles separated along the
north-south direction, perpendicular to the former one. The cross
separation of these dipole patches with opposite polarities led to
the continuous interactions between diﬀerent dipolar ﬁelds, ac-
companied by magnetic ﬂux cancellations at some places (To-
riumi et al. 2013; Louis et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017). Strong
shearing motions between the patches with opposite polarities
accumulated dramatic free energy (Shimizu et al. 2014; Tori-
umi & Takasao 2017) and could result in magnetic reconnection
(Moore et al. 2001), which would lead to the formation of ﬂux
ropes (Xue et al. 2017). The rotation of the associated magnetic
patch also contributes to the magnetic ﬂux rope buildup. In Sect.
3.3, we speculated on the detailed process concerning the for-
mations of these ﬂux ropes and twisted loop bundles. It is worth
mentioning that during the impulsive phase of the X9.3 ﬂare, a
white-light signal was detected as well as anomalous magnetic
transient near the PIL (see the animation corresponding to Fig.
4), indicating a violent release of energy (Hudson et al. 1992;
Song et al. 2018). We propose that in AR 12673 signiﬁcant ﬂux
emergence and successive cross-separations between the patches
of diﬀerent newly emerging dipoles resulted in the formation of
multiple ﬂux ropes and twisted loop bundles in the same AR and
the storage of dramatic magnetic energy.
