Abstract

Radar Wind Proﬁlers (RWP) are well-established in-
struments for the probing of the atmospheric boundary
layer, with the immense advantage of long-range and all-
weather operation capability. One of their main limita-
tions, however, is a relatively long integration time com-
pared to other instruments such as lidars. In the context
of L-band RWP we show that the use of Autoregressive
(AR) modeling for the antenna signals combined with the
Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) allows for a correct
estimation of radial wind velocity proﬁles even with very
short time samples. A systematical analysis of perfor-
mance is made with the help of synthetic data. These
numerical results are further conﬁrmed by an experimen-
tal dataset acquired near the landing runways of Paris
Charles de Gaulle (CDG) Airport, France, and validated
using a colocated optical lidar at the Aerological station
of Payerne, Switzerland. It is found that the AR-MEM
approach can successfully derive reliable wind estimates
using integration times as short as 2.5 s where the classical
spectral approach can barely provide any measurement.
In addition, the technique helps mitigating the impact of
uncooperative ﬂyers in the processing of the atmospheric
echo, leading to a more successful application of the wind
estimation algorithm.

Introduction

Radar wind proﬁlers (RWP) measure vertical proﬁles of
wind speed in the lower atmosphere under all kinds of me-
teorological conditions and are widely used in the context
of atmospheric research (e.g. [14, 26]), operational mete-
orology (e.g. [31, 4, 13]), data assimilation [39] or instru-
ments validation ([19, 8]). They generally operate in the
VHF or UHF frequency bands in pulse-Doppler mode [1],
even though there have been isolated attempts to develop
frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) systems
(e.g. [38, 24]). They work in a coherent integration mode
in order to record not only the strength of the echo but
also its Doppler shift. Contrarily to optical measurement

systems (lasers and lidars) they are not hindered or at-
tenuated by clouds or fog nor necessitate the presence
of aerosols as backscattering elements; contrarily to mi-
crowave weather radars, they are not bound to the sole
backscattering of hydrometeors but also have the unique
capability of capturing a “clear-air” return even in the
far range, up to a few dozen of kilometers in L-band [43].
In the classical electromagnetic theory, this is explained
by a Bragg scattering mechanism from the small turbu-
lent ﬂuctuations of the refractive index in the air volume
which follow the wind motion (e.g. [36, 25]). The radial
speed of atmospheric echoes is characterized by a Doppler
frequency peak which can be measured by a coherent in-
tegration of the backscattered signal [43]. It is in general
assumed that the mean velocity of the scattering struc-
tures in the atmosphere (obtained with the ﬁrst moment
of the Doppler spectrum) coincide with wind speed while
its dispersion (quantiﬁed with the second moment) quan-
tiﬁes the turbulence. The wind vector can be recombined
from the simultaneous measurement of radial speeds ob-
tained with several oblique antennas, a technique often
called Doppler Beam Swinging (DBS, [3]). Hence RWP
can provide all-weather, long-range reliable estimates of
the wind vector with a typical range resolution of 150 m
to 300 m corresponding to the transmitted pulse duration.

Now, detecting the very weak clear-air echoes and accu-
rately evaluating their speed dictates the use of “long” co-
herent integration time, that is a large number of emitted
pulses. This is necessary for both increasing the Signal-
to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and improving the estimation of
the Doppler spectrum. Doppler spectra are then inco-
herently averaged over integration times of the order of
20 s per beam which are far beyond the temporal scale
of many rapidly ﬂuctuating phenomena such as planes
and birds echoes, or vortex and wakes caused by ﬂying
objects.
In part because of this limitation but also for
practical reasons, RWP has been competed since the early
2000s with Doppler lidars which are compact and versatile
instruments. These active laser-based instruments mea-
sure wind speed and direction at smaller spatio-temporal
scales. Wind lidars indeed use much shorter integration
times, of the order of 1 s per beam (see, e.g., [18]), to-
gether with smaller range cell resolution (typically 50 m).
This has allowed for a number of studies of the turbulent
atmosphere in the context of emerging industrial applica-
tions, mostly linked to the monitoring of turbulent wakes
from planes or wind turbines (e.g. [2, 32, 20]). However,
this is at the expense of a much shorter range, typically

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
a few kilometers.

Nevertheless, the unique ability of RWP to study at-
mospheric turbulence in all-weather and the much longer
range they achieve as compared to optical sensors make
them irreplaceable if the limitation of long integration
time can be overcome. The aim of this paper is to show
that the reduced number of available samples for short
integration time can be mitigated by the use of non-
spectral signal-processing techniques, which bypass the
time-frequency trade-oﬀ of the Fourier analysis. One such
technique, based on an autoregressive (AR) representa-
tion of the backscattered signal associated with a maxi-
mum entropy method (MEM), has been successfully ap-
plied in the context of oceanographic radars [15] to obtain
Doppler spectra at rapid scale and capture some tran-
sient phenomena such as tsunamis-induced currents [17].
In the atmospheric context, the AR-MEM approach was
successfully used for the time-frequency analysis of vari-
ous transient phenomena at rapid time scale (see Figure
3 of [16]). Here, we apply the same method to RWP for
wind measurement and demonstrate its potential on an
experimental set of L-band data.

This article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
the mathematical framework used to process the atmo-
spheric backscattered signal with the AR representation
and the MEM for evaluating its coeﬃcients. The perfor-
mances of the method are assessed with synthetic RWP
data and compared to a classical Fourier analysis (Section
3). Section 4 presents a ﬁrst application of this method-
ology to an actual RWP dataset. Finally, the validity
of the short-time estimations is evaluated against lidar
measurements (Section 5).

2 AR Modeling of

the Atmo-

spheric Doppler Spectrum

We brieﬂy recall the backscattering mechanisms at play in
the turbulent atmosphere and the few signal processing
steps which are conventionally employed to extract the
spectral moments from the antenna voltage time-series.
The reader is referred to [41, 5, 7] for a complete review
of the processing scheme.

2.1 Atmospheric Doppler Spectrum

The theoretical Doppler spectrum σ(ω) is the limiting
form of the power spectral density (PSD) of the backscat-
tered range-resolved complex time-series s(t, r) for large
integration time and a given detection volume (the range
index r is implicit and will be omitted in the following).
To an amplitude factor, given by the radar equation, the
Doppler spectrum writes

where W (t) is a windowing function over the integration
time T and ω is the circular frequency. As it is well
known, the Doppler frequency shift is proportional to the

radial velocity Vr of scatterers, ω = 2πf = 4πVr/λ, where
λ is the radar wavelength. Hence the Doppler spectrum
can be interpreted as a power-weighted distribution of the
radial velocities within the resolution volume [43], where
the weighting function depends on the scatterers reﬂectiv-
ity and velocity. In the following we will therefore express
the Doppler spectra as a function of the radial speed v
rather than Doppler frequency Due to the random motion
of scatterers during the observation time, the shape of the
weighting function is generally assumed to be Gaussian

width is related to the distribution of the individual scat-
terer velocities which is spread by shear or turbulence.
It can happen that the assumption of Gaussian distribu-
tion of velocities is violated when some strong intermit-
tent clutter echoes (in particular from ﬂyers) is superim-
posed to the atmospheric return. Such parasitic echoes
should be ﬁltered or at least ignored when inferring radial
wind speed from Doppler spectrum. Therefore in the ab-
sence of noise and clutter, a Gaussian-shaped atmospheric
Doppler spectrum has the generic form [41]:

Complex voltage time-series are coherently recorded at
the output of a quadrature demodulator and sorted into
range cells. For each gate, around 50 to 100 samples
(that is 50 to 100 emitted pulses) are coherently summed
which is equivalent to a time-domain averaging. After
digital decimation the sampling frequency is of the or-
der of 150 to 200 Hz giving a typical Nyquist interval of
10 m.s−1. Note that the sampling strat-

tistical Averaging Method (SAM) of Merritt [29]. In the
SAM approach, it is assumed that the atmospheric sig-
nal has Gaussian statistics whereas intermittent echoes

(birds, planes, uncooperative ﬂyers, etc.) are larger, non-
Gaussian signals. Temporal variations of each range-
Doppler bin (or, equivalently, range-radial velocity bin)
should therefore comply to an exponential distribution
test as proposed by Hildebrand and Sekhon (HS) [22].
Hence the SAM makes only use of the frequency bin
passing the exponential energy distribution test of HS,
every other being considered as non-atmospheric echoes
and discarded from the average. The main strength of the
SAM is that it needs no assumption on the nature of the
intermittent echoes. However, as it is based on a statisti-
cal criterion, the SAM assumes that the atmosphere can
be observed free of parasitic echoes at each range gate and
frequency bin for at least one sample Doppler spectrum.
Once the “clean” Doppler spectra are obtained, a
Multipeaks Picking Procedure (MPP) is used (see e.g.
[11, 30, 40]) to identify at most three peaks for each
range gate as the averaged spectra may still contain some
ground-clutter and ﬂyers echoes in addition to the atmo-
spheric signal. Selection of one single peak would there-
fore lead to wrong estimates as non-atmospheric echoes
may remain after the SAM processing. The ﬁrst three
spectral moments of the identiﬁed peaks are computed
and used to remove those having speciﬁc non-atmospheric
signatures. Finally, some empirical criteria on the spec-
tral moments are used along with the constraint of veloc-
ity continuity with respect to range to select for the most
likely atmospheric peak. In the following, we will refer to
this standard processing scheme as the “FFT method”.

A typical RWP Doppler spectrum for a resolution vol-
ume in fair weather is shown in Figure 1. It is obtained
from an incoherent summation of NSPEC = 61 instan-
taneous spectra of 128 samples each. The sampling fre-
quency is 204 Hz, leading to an unambiguous (or Nyquist)
velocity of Nv = 12 m.s−1. Two echoes, labeled (a) and
(b), can be observed in the spectrum. The zero-velocity
peak corresponds to reﬂections from the ground or “ﬁxed-
echoes”, while the broader peak is a Gaussian-shaped at-
mospheric echo. Here, ﬁxed-echoes are of greater energy
than the atmospheric return, a situation commonly en-
countered in the lowest range gates. The mean radial
velocity is estimated to ˆVr = 4.50 m.s−1 and the spec-
trum width to ˆσv = 1.36 m.s−1. Note that the spectrum
width is often normalized by twice the Nyquist velocity,
so that ˆσvn = ˆσv/2Nv = 0.057.

The temporal resolution of the inverted wind velocity
is constrained by the minimal integration time T = N ∆t
of each individual Doppler spectra necessary to ensure a
satisfactory frequency (hence radial velocity) resolution
and SNR and a suﬃcient number NSPEC of incoherent
spectra to obtain a meaningful ensemble average. With
the typical experimental values T = 128
5 ms = 640 ms
for the coherent integration time and 50 for the number
of incoherent spectra, this leads to a temporal resolu-
tion of about 16 seconds for the wind velocity, an acquisi-
tion rate that might be too coarse for the observations of
some transitory phenomena. Due to the time-frequency
dilemma, the integration time cannot be further reduced
in the frame of the FFT method. This limits the accu-
racy of the velocity estimation and calls for an alternative,

where P(cid:15) is the white noise PSD. It must be underlined
that this derivation of the PSD presents important diﬀer-
ences with respect to the expression (4) obtained with a
classical FFT. In the AR approach, the signal is not as-
sumed to be periodic and the spectral estimation does not
suﬀer from windowing nor truncation. Furthermore, the
PSD (6) can be evaluated at arbitrary frequency ω and is
not bound to a discrete set of dual frequencies as imposed
by the FFT. As pointed out by [23], this is particularly
suitable for short time series, when the FFT would nei-
ther ensure suﬃcient frequency resolution nor statistical
convergence.

A key point in estimating the AR spectra is the choice
of the optimal order p, a problem that has been exten-
[33, 12]). Small
sively discussed in the literature (e.g.
values of p with respect to the number of samples N gen-
erally leads to a poor frequency resolution while large val-

According to (6), estimating the AR PSD is equivalent
to ﬁnding the AR coeﬃcients. Multiple methods have
been proposed, namely the Yule-Walker equations, the
Levinson-Durbin algorithm, or the Burg method (we re-
fer to [27] for a review). This last method is known to give
PSD estimates with high resolution, especially for short
records [34, 9], a property which motivated our choice in
the present context. In the Burg method [6] the AR co-
eﬃcients are obtained by minimizing the square sum of
the forward and backward prediction errors, considering
the AR model (5) as a linear prediction ﬁlter. Multi-
ple implementations of the Burg’s method are nowadays
available in most digital signal processing programming
languages. The Burg’s method can further be interpreted
in terms of signal entropy as it maximizes the random-
ness of the unknown time series. In agreement with the
radar literature [21], we will hereinafter refer to the Burg’s
method as the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) and its
combination with an AR process as the AR-MEM. The
standard processing scheme described in Section 2.1 with
the replacement of the FFT with the AR-MEM for the
computation of the Doppler spectrum will be referred to
in the following as the “AR-MEM method”.

3 Evaluation With

Synthetic

Data

To assess the performances of the AR-MEM in the con-
text of rapid scale wind proﬁling, we went through a se-
ries of tests using synthetic RWP-like time-series with a
known radial wind velocity. We used the method de-
scribed in [42] for constructing synthetic data with re-
alistic statistical properties. We could therefore generate
“weatherlike” voltage complex time series with prescribed
radial wind speed Vr, spectral width σvn and SNR. To do
this we ﬁrst construct the signal PSD as:

where σ is a centered Gaussian-shaped atmospheric PSD
(2), C is a narrow Gaussian-shaped PSD accounting for

white noise and X is an exponentially distributed random
variable. The complex spectral components lead to the
complex voltage time series through an inverse Fourier
transform:

where ωj = 2πj/T and ϕj are uniform independent ran-
dom phases. By construction, the amplitudes √P are
Rayleigh distributed and the individual frequency compo-
nents are complex Gaussian variables. The deterministic

We performed a series of numerical tests according to
the model (7), (8) and (2) for some typical values of the
radial wind speed Vr and spectral width σv and for a
wide range of samples sizes N and SNR. The instanta-
neous PSD was recalculated using either the AR-MEM
or the classical FFT approach by processing half over-
lapping series of variable length. The sample size was
increased from N = 16 to N = 128 corresponding to an
integration time from T = 80 ms to T = 640 ms. While
the number of available frequency bins with the FFT is
equal to the sample length, the AR-MEM makes it possi-
ble to evaluate the PSD using (6) over an arbitrary large
number of frequency bins (here 128). For each test case,
a total of 100 random time series were generated and
the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was calculated be-
tween estimated and simulated radial wind speed. Figure

(Figure 2(a)) and AR-MEM (Figure 2(b)). As expected,
the RMSE is smaller for “long” than “short” integration
times in both FFT and AR-MEM. Furthermore, in the

in AR-MEM is twice lower than in FFT (0.56 m.s

the estimation is robust to noise, as seen from the quasi-
constant value of the RMSE as the SNR is increased.
This is due to the barycentric method used by the MPP
to identify the precise peak location within the Doppler
spectrum. In the same manner we also assessed the ro-
bustness of the second-order moment (Figure 3). For
“long” time series (N = 128) FFT and AR-MEM provide

accurate estimates, with an RMSE close to 25 cm.s
However, the RMSE of the estimation obtained with FFT
increases signiﬁcantly when the sample size is decreased
−1 for N = 16). As previously stated the
(up to 1.5 m.s
frequency resolution of the FFT is insuﬃcient for such
short samples, causing the atmospheric echo to spread
over multiple frequency bins and mixing with the ground-
clutter echo. In AR-MEM, the frequency resolution re-
mains constant regardless of the integration time and the
atmospheric echo is adequately described in the Doppler
spectrum.

Finally we assessed the computational time needed to
produce AR-MEM Doppler spectra with respect to the
conventional FFT method. The latter is known to re-
quire O(N log N ) operations for a single sample of N time
steps. In AR-MEM, the authors estimated that the com-
putational time with an optimal order p = N/2 is of the
order of O(N 2) [15]. This should not prevent from us-
ing the AR-MEM as the average computational time per
beam for 60 range gates (that is, the average computa-
tional time requested for computing Doppler spectra as
Figure 6(c)) was found to be 21.40 s on a standard desk-
top computer, while being only of 2.18 s in FFT. In prac-
tice, this computational time can be further decreased
by diminishing the order (N/3 instead of N/2) without
signiﬁcantly deteriorating the spectral estimation.

4 Experimental assessment with a

L-band RWP

The potential of the AR-MEM to estimate wind velocities
at a rapid time scale in experimental conditions was eval-
uated on the basis of the measurements provided by the
PCL1300 UHF RWP manufactured by company Degre-
ane Horizon, operating at 1.274 GHz. The data set under
consideration was acquired on September 24, 2012, near
the landing runways of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport,
Roissy-en-France, France (49 °N, 2.75 °E, 107 m above sea
level). The weather was mostly cloudy with an average
relative humidity of 76 %. Four radar beams were pointed
θ = 17° from the zenith to the north, east, west and south
and a ﬁfth beam pointed to the zenith, using the classical
DBS technique. Uninterrupted time series of 3264 sam-
ples (17.5 s) were collected for each beam and range gate.
In order to achieve a trade-oﬀ between the range resolu-
tion and the available range, which are impacted in con-
tradictory ways by the pulse duration, two pulsing modes
were used alternatively. The ﬁrst sweep cycle was realized
on the 5 antennas in “high mode”, that is with a pulse

Figure 4: Data recorded by the Paris CDG RWP on
September 24, 2012, on the range gate 3 of “low mode
” (225 m range) and processed using the FFT method
from “short” time-series (N = 16 time steps).

duration of τ = 2.5 µs; a second sweep cycle was run in
“low mode” corresponding to a shorter pulse duration of
τ = 1 µs. The high mode provides measurements to a
maximal theoretical range of 8.5 km with a range resolu-
tion of 375 m while the low mode give access to a ﬁner
range resolution (150 m) over a shorter range interval (up
to 4.5 km). Hereinafter, the “reference” processing sce-
nario consists in using the FFT method over “long” half
overlapping samples (N = 128) and applying the SAM
over the resulting NSPEC = 61 individual PSD. This
corresponds to a total integration time of 17.5 s and pro-
vides a frequency resolution ∆f = 1.61 Hz allowing for a
velocity resolution ∆Vr = 0.19 m.s−1, assuming station-
ary wind over this duration.

We ﬁrst assessed the performances of the AR-MEM
in computing the Doppler spectrum from “short” time-
series. In this fast-time scenario the voltage time-series
were split into 487 overlapping sub-series of N = 16
time steps from which the individual PSD were computed
using the FFT and the AR-MEM. As an example the
temporal variations of the instantaneous PSD are shown
in the time-Doppler plane in Figs. 4(a) and 5(a) using
17.5 s of data. The FFT spectrogram yields a coarse fre-
quency resolution ∆f = 13.6 Hz (or velocity resolution
∆Vr = 1.6 m.s−1), while the short-time AR-MEM com-
puted with optimal order (p = 8) on a ﬁner frequency grid
(128 bins) exhibits a frequency resolution ∆f = 1.76 Hz
(that is ∆Vr = 0.21 m.s−1). In the former case (Figure
4(a)), the wind echo in the positive radial velocities is
mixed with the ground-clutter. A non-cooperative ﬂyer,
likely a bird, produces a strong echo between the 5th and
9th second on the time axis and cannot be distinguished

quency grid (128 bins) leads to a wind proﬁle which is
fully consistent with the reference scenario.

To conﬁrm this observation, a systematic comparison
of the two processing methods using long and short in-
tegration time was run using 24 h of the high-mode data
acquired along the 5 beams. We performed consistency
tests between the velocity estimates obtained with long
and short integration times and obtained using the dif-
ferent methods. The scatterplots in Fig. 7 show that
the FFT and AR-MEM method are perfectly consistent
for long integration times but quite diﬀerent for short in-
tegration time, where only the AR-MEM is capable of
reproducing the performances of the long time counter-
part.

In a similar way we investigated the accuracy of the
second-order moment σv. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the
spectral width parameter is signiﬁcantly overestimated

Again, the AR-MEM estimates beneﬁt from a ﬁner fre-

5 Validation with colocated Lidar

measurements

The validity of the short-time AR-MEM to infer radial
wind velocities from RWP experimental measurements
has ﬁrst been assessed by self-consistency tests with long-
time estimates (Figures 7 and 8). We now provide a fur-
ther validation of the method by comparison with a colo-
cated wind Doppler lidar. The comparison of radar and
lidar proﬁler is always challenging due to the very diﬀer-
ent spatio-temporal scales entering in play,. However, a
good agreement between the two types of instruments has
already been reported in the literature. For example us-
ing the NOAA high-resolution Doppler lidar (HRDL) and
a 915 MHz boundary layer RWP, [10], an excellent corre-
lation between lidar and RWP observations (R2 = 0.99)
−1) were re-
and a small mean absolute error (0.15 m.s
ported.

The integration times required with lidars are by at
least one order of magnitude smaller than those typi-
cally employed with RWP; this is therefore adapted to
evaluate the accuracy of short-time measurements with
RWP. Both instruments were operated at the Aerological
station of Payerne (7 °E, 47 °N, 491 m above sea level),
45 km North-East of Lausanne, Switzerland. This station
is part of a network owned by the Federal Oﬃce of Mete-
orology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss) intended to mon-
itor the atmosphere above the Swiss Plateau. The RWP
of Payerne has the same characteristics as the aforemen-
tioned Paris CDG RWP (see Section 4), except that its
oblique beams are rotated by 45° with respect to North,
hence pointing to North-East, South-East, South-West
and North-West, respectively, with an angle θ = 17° to
the zenith. The lidar is of type WindCube WLS200S
manufactured by company Vaisala. An overview of the

time-Doppler spectrogram (Figure 5(a)) preserves an ac-
curate description of the atmospheric echo, even in pres-
ence of the ﬂyer.

To conﬁrm these observations we further used the SAM
from 8 groups of NSPEC = 61 individual PSD (delimited
by dashed lines on Figs. 4(a) and 5(a)). The resulting
Doppler spectra are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) for the

time scenario using FFT (Fig. 5(b)), the atmospheric
echo is mixed with the ground-clutter for the near-zero
velocities. The MPP therefore fails to retrieve the wind
peak as the resolution of the Doppler spectrum is clearly
insuﬃcient. However the AR-MEM Doppler spectra (Fig.
4(b)) is able to identify unambiguously two distinct peaks
corresponding to the ground-clutter and the atmospheric
return.

We now assess the performances of AR-MEM with re-
spect to the FFT method by comparing the correspond-
ing range-Doppler proﬁles. Fig. 6 depicts such proﬁles
along the southern beam for the high mode data using
either method. Again, the PSD was computed using
NSPEC = 61 half overlapping time-series followed by
the SAM as previously described. The MPP is applied
on each range gate to identify 3 peaks and a consen-
sus algorithm is used to retain the most probable wind
peak. Both the aforementioned reference and fast-time
scenarios are tested with the FFT and AR-MEM meth-
ods. In the former scenario (Fig. 6(a)), a typical wind
echo is clearly identiﬁable up to 3 km with a radial veloc-
−1.
ity close to 5 m.s
In the fast-time scenario using FFT (Fig. 6(b)), the at-
mospheric echo is mixed with the ground-clutter in the
lowest range gates. The spectral moments could not be
properly retrieved as the resolution of the Doppler spec-
trum is very insuﬃcient, leading to obviously erroneous
wind estimates. However, the short-time AR-MEM (Fig.

diﬀerent methods when compared with the reference lidar
measurements are recap in Table 2. For long time-series,
the FFT and AR-MEM estimates (Figs. 9(a) and (b),
show similar performances (although a slightly

improvement is obtained with AR-MEM) with a global

ﬁcient. At short integration time (Figs. 9(c) and (d),
resp.), however, the use of the AR-MEM allows for an im-
portant increase in the number of available measurements
with respect to the conventional FFT method (from 167
to 522) as well as more accurate estimates, with a RMSE
reduced by about 20 % and a higher correlation coeﬃ-
cient.

For the purpose of the comparison with the RWP, the
lidar data under consideration were processed as follows.
First, the zonal, meridional and vertical wind compo-
nents (u, v, w) were projected along the four oblique radar
beams as

Ur,ϕ = u sin θ sin ϕ + v sin θ sin ϕ + w cos θ

(9)

where ϕ is the beam azimuth with respect to North. Then
the projected radial velocities were interpolated on the
radar range gates and the lidar measurements contained
within each radar integration time were averaged. The
comparisons were made using FFT and AR-MEM meth-
ods, using long (N = 128 time steps) and short (N = 16
time steps) time series. We chose to present only the mea-
surements performed on two opposite radar beams, here
the North-East and the South-West, but similar results
were obtained using the two remaining beams.

The results of the comparisons for each diﬀerent pro-
cessing are shown in Figure 9 using the lidar measure-
ments as reference. Additionally, the performances of the

6 Discussion and Conclusion

We have presented an application of the AR modeling
with MEM to the wind proﬁling of the lower atmo-
sphere using L-band Doppler radars. While the common
operational approach relies on the computation of the
Doppler spectrum using the FFT algorithm, we made use

−1, while being only of 2.10 m.s
short-time FFT was found to be 4.83 m.s

−1 in short-time AR-MEM.

It was shown that the AR-MEM can be used to visual-
ize the temporal variations of the Doppler spectrum at
high temporal rate, whereas the FFT fails to accurately
represents the atmospheric echo in such conditions. A
statistical analysis of the performances of wind proﬁling
using either method, AR-MEM and FFT, has been made
for short-time samples using long-time samples as refer-
ence. The main outcome is that the use of AR-MEM
allows for a signiﬁcant decrease in the RMSE of both
ﬁrst- and second-order spectral moments estimates. To
further validate the AR-MEM wind proﬁling we analyzed
a 12 h-dataset of colocated RWP and lidar measurements
in Payerne. Again, the AR-MEM velocity estimates were
found in closer agreement to the lidar for short-time sam-
ples.

RWP measurements are often contaminated by the spu-
rious and frequent returns of uncooperative ﬂyers such as
birds or planes. The robustness of the AR-MEM method
to these parasitic echoes even with short time series has
been assessed. This paves the way to new strategies to
mitigate the unwanted presence of uncooperative ﬂyers
in wind proﬁling. Another useful application of the rapid
wind proﬁling is the spectral analysis of clear-air turbu-
lence echoes which requires a large variety of temporal
scales. For both applications, dedicated measurement
campaigns will be carried out in the future.

time-series. This allowed to bypass the time-frequency
dilemma encountered when using the FFT. The MEM
was further found to be eﬃcient to estimate the AR co-
eﬃcients in the context of short radar samples. We have
ﬁrst tested the proposed AR-MEM approach on the basis
of noisy synthetic RWP time-series and quantiﬁed its aug-
mented performances with respect to the classical spectral
estimation in terms of robustness to noise when inverting
the ﬁrst- and second-order spectral moments from short
samples.

The AR-MEM approach was applied to a 24 h-set of
data recorded with a RWP during an experiment in the
vicinity of the landing runways of Paris CDG Airport.
