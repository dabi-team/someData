ABSTRACT
Strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters is a fundamental tool to study dark
matter and constrain the geometry of the Universe. Recently, the HST Frontier Fields
program has allowed a signiﬁcant improvement of mass and magniﬁcation measure-
ments but lensing models still have a residual RMS between 0.2” and few arcseconds,
not yet completely understood. Systematic errors have to be better understood and
treated in order to use strong lensing clusters as reliable cosmological probes. We have
analysed two simulated Hubble Frontier Fields-like clusters from the Hubble Frontier
Fields Comparison Challenge, Ares and Hera. We use several estimators (relative bias
on magniﬁcation, density proﬁles, ellipticity and orientation) to quantify the goodness
of our reconstructions by comparing our multiple models, optimized with the para-
metric software Lenstool, with the input models. We have quantiﬁed the impact of
systematic errors arising, ﬁrst, from the choice of diﬀerent density proﬁles and conﬁgu-
rations and, secondly, from the availability of constraints (spectroscopic or photometric
redshifts, redshift ranges of the background sources) in the parametric modelling of
strong lensing galaxy clusters and therefore on the retrieval of cosmological param-
eters. We ﬁnd that substructures in the outskirts have a signiﬁcant impact on the
position of the multiple images, yielding tighter cosmological contours. The need for
wide-ﬁeld imaging around massive clusters is thus reinforced. We show that competi-
tive cosmological constraints can be obtained also with complex multimodal clusters
and that photometric redshifts improve the constraints on cosmological parameters
when considering a narrow range of (spectroscopic) redshifts for the sources.

1 INTRODUCTION

Strong gravitational Lensing (SL, hereafter) is nowadays at
the very heart of important issues in modern cosmology, al-
lowing for instance to measure directly the total projected
mass distribution (baryonic and dark) of galaxy cluster cores
(e.g. Richard et al. 2010; Zitrin & Broadhurst 2016; Monna
et al. 2017; Mahler et al. 2017), to image very high redshift
sources otherwise too faint to be detected without the grav-

the geometry of the Universe (Jullo et al. 2010; D’Aloisio &

Type Ia supernovae (Riess et al. 1998), baryon acoustic os-
cillations (Beutler et al. 2011; Gil-Mar´ın et al. 2016), cosmic
shear (Massey et al. 2007; Heymans et al. 2012; Hildebrandt
et al. 2017), cluster abundances (de Haan et al. 2016), CMB
anisotropies (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016a) or time de-
lays (Suyu et al. 2016) are some of the several probes allow-
ing to better understand the constituents of the Universe
and their properties by putting tighter constraints on cos-
mological parameters.
However, in order to obtain robust estimates of cosmological
parameters, estimates from the diﬀerent cosmological probes
must be combined as each technique has distinct degenera-
cies and biases (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016b; Peel et al.
2017).
Among the previously mentioned cosmological probes, us-
ing the strong lensing features in galaxy clusters is a very
promising technique that yields orthogonal constraints in
an era of precise cosmology (Golse et al. 2002; Gilmore &
Natarajan 2009; Jullo et al. 2010). To perform cosmography
with strong lenses, a precise and accurate mass distribution
of the cluster is required, i.e, a large number of constraints
is crucial.
Recently, the Hubble Frontier Fields program1 (HFF; P.I.:
J. Lotz, Lotz et al. 2017) with the Hubble Space Telescope
(hereafter HST) has provided the deepest multi-colour imag-
ing of galaxy clusters to date, that combined with spec-
troscopy from ground-based surveys, has led to the discov-
ery of hundreds of multiple images and thus to a signiﬁcant
improvement of cluster mass estimates (Jauzac et al. 2014;
Diego et al. 2016; Lagattuta et al. 2016; Monna et al. 2017).
The mass modelling of strong lensing clusters can be carried
out in diﬀerent manners: parametric and non-parametric
methods are equally used; the primary distinction between
them being that parametric modelling assumes that lumi-
nous cluster galaxies trace the cluster mass whereas non-
parametric does not.
The FF-SIMS Challenge (Meneghetti et al. 2016), an archive
of mock HFF-like clusters, has provided the lensing commu-
nity with a set of simulated clusters in order to highlight for
the ﬁrst time the strengths and weaknesses of each meth-
ods: parametric and non-parametric. This work would allow
the non-lensing community to choose a method and soft-
ware according to their diﬀerent needs. This challenge has
shown that all lensing reconstruction methods provide reli-
able mass distributions. However, strong lensing modelling
appears to be still unable to match the HST observations
angular resolution (
0.05”) with a residual RMS between
0.2” and a few arcseconds (Limousin et al. 2016), a system-
atical error not yet completely understood and few studies
have addressed this issue.
Indeed, strong lensing mass modelling has various sources
of systematic errors, arising from the hypothesis behind our
models, which have recently started to be acknowledged
and analysed in a more quantitative way. Meneghetti et al.
(2010) studied the properties of
50000 strong lensing clus-
ters in the MARENOSTRUM cosmological simulation. They
ﬁnd that strong lenses tend to have their major axes oriented
along the line of sight. This orientation bias results for in-
stance in cluster concentrations estimations from the pro-

jected density proﬁles to be biased high (Giocoli et al. 2014;
Sereno et al. 2015). D’Aloisio & Natarajan (2011) quantiﬁed
that the modelling errors due to the scatter in the cluster-
galaxy scaling relations and unmodelled line-of-sight haloes
can result in errors of the order of a few arcseconds on aver-
age. Bayliss et al. (2015) studied the impact of assuming a
certain cosmological model on the determination of magniﬁ-
cation and mass proﬁles of the cluster core for HFF clusters
showing that cosmological parameter uncertainty is a non-
negligible source of errors for the lens modelling.
Foreground or background large-scale structures impacts the
SL modelling as well (Dalal et al. 2005; Host 2012), that
could introduce a systematic error of up to
1.4” on the
position of multiple images (Zitrin et al. 2015). Line of sight
eﬀects have then to be taken into account during the strong
lensing modelling in order to recover precise cosmological
parameters (Jullo et al. 2010; Caminha et al. 2016).
Systematic errors can also arise from the mass distribu-
tions assumed for the dark matter components as shown
in Limousin et al. (2016) where the observed constraints in
MACS0717 are equally well reproduced by a mass model
with a shallow large-scale DM component and one for which
this component is peaky. Harvey et al. (2016) analysed the
FF cluster MACSJ0416 (z = 0.397) and found that the as-
sumption that light traces mass can introduce an error of
0.5” on the position of the multiple images. Bouwens et al.
∼
(2016) studied the impact of magniﬁcation uncertainties on
luminosity functions from the ﬁrst four HFF clusters. John-
son & Sharon (2016) have led the ﬁrst investigation attempt-
ing to quantify systematic errors induced by the availability
of constraints in strong lensing clusters. They show that the
accuracy of the magniﬁcation is sensitive to the selection of
constraints rather than their amount.
In this paper we take advantage of the mock HFF-like clus-
ters archive from the FF-SIMS Challenge and use two of the
HFF-like mock strong lensing clusters (Ares and Hera) to
investigate how systematic errors in the strong lensing para-
metric modelling with Lenstool aﬀect the determination
of the total mass distribution in clusters and hence the re-
trieval of robust cosmological parameters such as the mean
matter density and dark energy equation of state parame-
ters ΩM and w, respectively.
First, we use four diﬀerent estimators (density proﬁles, rel-
ative bias on magniﬁcation, cluster’s ellipticity and orienta-
tion angle) to compare our reconstructions with the input
models in order to assess the impact of diﬀerent mass distri-
butions and conﬁgurations in the strong lensing modelling
of clusters and hence on the cosmography.
Secondly, we study how the availability of constraints aﬀects
the retrieval of unbiased cosmological parameters. We inves-
tigate if there is a more eﬃcient range of redshifts to recover
the input cosmology, if including photometric redshifts can
result in a more robust estimation of these parameters and
if taking into account an increasing number of photometric
families translates into an increasing precision in the cosmo-
logical parameters estimation.
The paper is organized as follows: the data used for this anal-
ysis is presented in Section 2, in Section 3 we describe the
methodology, in Section 4 we detail the diﬀerent modellings
for Ares and Hera, we then show the systematic uncertain-
ties in Section 5, their impact on cosmography in Section 6
and conclude in Section 7.

2 THE DATA

We have analysed two mock HFF-like clusters from the
FF-simulations Challenge archive (Meneghetti et al. 2016):
Ares and Hera. They were initially created for the lens
modelling comparison project, which, for the ﬁrst time,
compares
the reconstructions obtained using diﬀerent
techniques, such as parametric, non-parametric and hybrid,
performed by diﬀerent teams.
Both clusters have been simulated to reproduce, not only
the characteristics of the HST Advandced Camera for Sur-
vey (ACS) and Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observations
(depth, passbands and spatial resolution), but also the
complexity of the FF clusters themselves even if these two
have been created using diﬀerent techniques.
Both clusters have then been modelled to be realistic,
complex, bi-modal clusters (see Figure 1), generated in a
ﬂat ΛCDM cosmological model.
During the challenge, all participants ﬁrst performed a
blind analysis (i.e, not knowing the true mass distribution)
of these clusters for which only the HFF-like images as well
as catalogues of multiple images (position and spectroscopic
redshifts) and cluster galaxies (positions and magnitudes
in all ACS/WFC3 bands) were provided with mF814W < 24
(see Table 1 for further details).
Ares is a more powerful lens than Hera, producing thus
many more multiple images (Meneghetti et al. 2016). Their
respective redshift distributions are shown in Figure A1.
The source galaxies resemble the luminosity and the redshift
distribution of the galaxies in the Hubble Ultra-Deep-Field
(Coe et al. 2006).
For both clusters, the software Skylens (Meneghetti et al.
2008) was used to ray-trace the lensed galaxies to the image
plane and to create simulated HFF-like images in all bands.
After the unblinding, the convergence and shear maps
(calculated for a source at zs=9) were provided. They were
used to compare our reconstructions with the true values
and also to improve our models. The input cosmology was
also revealed. We refer the reader to Meneghetti et al.
(2016) for a detailed presentation on how Ares and Hera
mass distributions were generated, here we only present a
quick overview.

2.1 Ares

Ares is a semi-analytical cluster (created using MOKA2
by Giocoli et al. 2012) at z=0.5. This simulated cluster is
built with three components: two smooth dark matter tri-
axial haloes with a NFW proﬁle, a bright central cluster
galaxy (BCG) with an Hernquist proﬁle (Hernquist 1990)
and sub-haloes having a Singular Isothermal Sphere proﬁle

(Hernquist 1990). Dark matter sub-haloes are populated us-
ing a Halo Occupation Distribution technique (HOD) and
stellar and B-band luminosities are given for all galaxies
according to the mass of their sub-halo as in Wang et al.
(2006). The mass within the virial radius is then deﬁned as
Mvir = Msmooth + Σimsub,i.
Ares is generated in a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmological model with
a matter density parameter ΩM = 0.272.

2.2 Hera

Hera is from a N-body simulation of cluster-sized dark
matter halos for a ﬂat ΛCDM model (see Planelles et al.
2014) at z=0.507 which was re-simulated using a TreePM-
SPH GADGET-3 code with only collision-less dark matter
particles. The properties of cluster galaxies are created
from Semi-Analytic Methods of galaxy formation (De Lucia
& Blaizot 2007). Hera is also created in a ﬂat ΛCDM cos-
mological model with a matter density parameter ΩM = 0.24.

For both clusters, the software Skylens (Meneghetti
et al. 2008) was used to ray-trace the lensed galaxies to the
image plane and to create simulated HFF-like images in all
bands.

3 METHODOLOGY

3.1 Mass modelling

We perform the strong lensing modelling in the source
plane using the public software Lenstool3 (Kneib et al.
1996; Jullo et al. 2007) which performed very well
for
the FF-SIMS Challlenge. Lenstool utilizes a Bayesian
Markov chain Monte-Carlo (hereafter MCMC, see Jullo
et al. 2007, for details) sampler to optimize the model using
the positions of the multiply imaged systems. The matter
distribution of clusters is decomposed into several smooth
large scale components and individual contributions from
cluster galaxies. In this work, the reconstructions are based
on the strong lensing information only.

We have modelled both clusters as up to three compo-
nents: i) large-scale potentials, ii) brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) and iii) individual galaxies identiﬁed spectroscop-
ically, with masses scaling with luminosity. Each mass
component has a parameterized proﬁle such as the Pseudo
Isothermal Elliptical Mass Distribution (Kassiola & Kovner
1993, hereafter PIEMD), Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW)

instance, large-scale potentials are modelled with either a
NFW or PIEMD, BCGs with PIEMD or Hernquist proﬁles
and individual clusters members with a PIEMD proﬁle,
scaled according to the relations in Limousin et al. (2005).
These mass distributions are brieﬂy presented hereafter.

We used the NFW density proﬁle (Navarro et al. 1997)
to model Ares and Hera large-scale mass distributions. The
3D density proﬁle is given by:

This proﬁle behaves as ρ ∝ r−
at r = rs and as ρ ∝ r−
In Lenstool, this proﬁle has the following free param-
eters: x and y, the coordinates of the halo centre; e,
the ellipticity, deﬁned as e = (a2 + b2)/(a2
b2) with a
and b the semi-major and semi-minor axis respectively
and θ , the position angle (counted counter-clockwise from
the x axis); rs, the scale radius and σ , the velocity dispersion.

The pseudo isothermal density proﬁle (Limousin et al.
2005) is used to model dark matter haloes and/or individual

It has the following free parameters: the coordinates x, y;

and rcut and a velocity dispersion, σ .

We use the Hernquist proﬁle (Hernquist 1990) to model
the BCGs of the two clusters. BCGs are massive elliptical
galaxies with observed luminosities well represented by the

at small radii but the density falls as ρ ∝ r−
It is parametrized using the following free parameters: the
coordinates x, y; the ellipticity, e; angle position, θ ; a core
radius, rcore and a velocity dispersion, σ .

Once the mass components are deﬁned, the best-ﬁtting
model parameters are found by minimizing the distance be-
tween the observed and model-predicted positions of the
multiple images, and the parameter covariance is estimated

3.2 Cosmological parameters

6 for Ares and zs ∼

As both Ares and Hera have a large number of multiple
images with spectroscopic redshifts for all images -up to
3.5 for Hera (see Figure
redshift zs ∼
A1)- they represent good probes to constrain cosmological
parameters.
We brieﬂy outline here the methodology to estimate these
parameters with cluster strong lensing (further details can
be found in Golse et al. 2002; Gilmore & Natarajan 2009,
for instance).
Strong lensing is sensitive to the underlying geometry of the
Universe as the position of the multiple images not only
depends on the mass distribution of the lens, but also on
the angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens
(DOL), to the source (DOS), and from the lens to the source
(DLS). This dependence is used to put constraints on the
cosmological parameters ΩM and w.
Indeed, the lens equation can be written as:

(cid:126)βi = (cid:126)θi −

2
c2

DLS
DOLDOS

∇φ ((cid:126)θi),

(7)

where θ and β are the (multiple) image angular po-
sitions in the lens and source planes respectively, φ is the
projected Newtonian potential of the lens and the cosmo-
logical dependence is embedded into the angular diameter
distances.
When only one family of multiple images is available, the

6

A. Acebron et al.

ratio between the cosmological distances cannot be disen-
tangled from the gradient of the potential. However, if at
least 2 systems of images at diﬀerent redshifts are available,
this degeneracy can be broken and via the ’family ratio’ (see
Link & Pierce 1998) from which constraints on ΩM and w
can be obtained:

Ξ(zL, zs1, zs2; ΩM, w) =

DLS1 DOS2
DOS1 DLS2

,

(8)

with zL is the redshift of the lens, zs1 and zs2 are the redshifts
of two distinct source and D is the angular diameter distance.
This kind of analysis has already been carried out for galaxy
clusters Abell 2218, Abell 1689 and Abell S1063 (or RXC
J2248.7-4431) by Soucail et al. (2004); Jullo et al. (2010);
Caminha et al. (2016) respectively and also with simulated
data (Golse et al. 2002; Gilmore & Natarajan 2009; D’Aloisio
& Natarajan 2011).
In this work, the energy density of the total matter of the
universe ΩM and the equation-of-state parameter w are set
as free parameters in a ΛCDM ﬂat cosmological model.

3.3 Priors

In this section we describe the choice of boundaries for the
ﬂat priors of the free parameters mentioned below. Some
boundaries are set with a quite large interval. However oth-
ers have more narrow priors.
The positions of the haloes (for both cluster- and galaxy-
scale potentials), x and y, correspond to the light peak of
galaxies (the position of the BCGs being the central coor-
dinates for the dark matter haloes). The angle position of
haloes are also set by the luminous component’s angle. The
ellipticity is not allowed to reach very high values following
Despali et al. (2017). This work shows that high ellipticities
(e > 0.75) are not favored by theoretical predictions.
Finally, some parameters have quite narrow priors as models
have been run several times and in order to gain in comput-
ing time some prior ranges were tighten, checking that the
boundaries were not reached. Nonetheless, we checked that
a slight change in the boundaries had no impact on the pos-
terior distribution of the parameters.

4 STRONG LENSING MODELS

We here present the details of each model for the Ares and
Hera clusters, the free parameters for each potential and the
respective ﬂat priors. These models are presented in chrono-
logical order as we tried to model the clusters in a more
complex way (and also after the unblinding of the true mass
proﬁles).
Their id number throughout the paper is the last number of
their corresponding subsection. The ﬁrst term stands for the
density proﬁle used for the large-scale haloes, the second (if
any) for BCGs.
All coordinates are presented as the distance to the cen-
tre of the clusters (in arcseconds) shown as the magenta
cross in Figure 1. The centre has been arbitrarily chosen
to be (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (0”, 0”) and serves as reference for
Lenstool.

4.1 Ares

Thanks to the HST simulated images, we easily see that
this cluster is bimodal, all the models thereafter will have
two large-scale haloes whose coordinates stated below corre-
spond to those of the light peaks (see upper panel of Figure
1). Cluster member galaxies are taken from the given simu-
lated catalogues up to a magnitude of mF160W < 22.0 (being
a more complex cluster, we limited the sample with a mag-
nitude cut to gain in computing time, representing > 90% of
the total cluster luminosity) and the small scale haloes asso-
ciated to galaxy members are parametrized with a PIEMD
proﬁle with a ﬁxed core radius of 0.15 kpc, a velocity dis-
persion σ (cid:63) allowed to vary between 94 and 180 km/s, a cut
radius r(cid:63)
cut varying from 78 kpc to 272.00 kpc, considered
spherical, with a mag0 = 18.5 (the reference magnitude for
the scaling relations corresponding to L(cid:63) at the cluster’s red-
shift) and following the scaling relations (Faber & Jackson
1976).
Moreover, three massive galaxies were more carefully mod-
elled (shown as green diamonds in Figure 1) also using a
PIEMD density proﬁle. These massive galactic haloes were
modelled independently (not using the scaling relations) as
they appeared to have a signiﬁcant impact in the mass pro-
ﬁle and/or on the nearby multiple images. For the three of
them, the cut radius r(cid:63)
is ﬁxed to 1000 kpc as initially
cut
the modelling was undertaken as the merger of four haloes
(supported by the high velocity dispersions of these massives
galaxies).
The ﬁrst galaxy (labelled as 1 in Figure 1) is ﬁxed at
(δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+4.053”, +22.042”) away from the centre
of the cluster. Its ellipticity can go up to 0.6, the angle po-
sition is allowed to vary from 60.0 to 120.0 degrees and its
velocity dispersion σ from 100.0 to 400.0 km/s.
The galaxy labelled as 2 in Figure 1 is located at
(δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+30.78”, -45.98”) away from the centre of
the cluster with an ellipticity from 0.3 to 0.7, the angle po-
sition is allowed to vary from 0.0 to 90.0 degrees and its
velocity dispersion σ from 50.0 to 400.0 km/s.
Finally, the galaxy labelled as 3 in Figure 1 is located at
(δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+33.008”, -63.542”) away from the centre of
the cluster. From the input convergence contours it appeared
as a massive halo. It is modelled with ellipticity with values
between 0.1 - 0.7, the angle position is allowed to vary from
141 to 171 degrees and its velocity dispersion σ from 400.0
to 700.0 km/s.
All multiple images are included in the models with a posi-
tional uncertainty of 0.5” and the optimization is performed
in the source plane as it is less computing time expensive.
We checked that the results are similar with both source and
image plane optimizations.

4.1.1 PIEMD

This ﬁrst model contains two large-scale haloes whose co-
ordinates are ﬁxed at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+20.0”, -32.0”) and
(-40.0”, +40.0”) away from the centre of the cluster respec-
tively. These clumps do not harbour any additional halo
linked to the BCGs.
For the ﬁrst clump, we let the core radius vary from 20 kpc
to 65 kpc with a ﬁxed cut radius of 1000 kpc. The ellipticity
of this halo is allowed to reach values from 0.2 and as high

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2017)

as 0.7 and its orientation from 130 to 140 degrees and the
velocity dispersion can vary from 400 to 1700 km/s. The sec-
ond large-scale halo can have a core radius with any value
from 20 kpc to 60 kpc and the cut radius is ﬁxed to 1000
kpc. Its ellipticity can take any value from 0.3 to 0.6, its ori-
entation can vary from 105 to 115 degrees and the velocity
dispersion can vary from 400 to 1000 km/s.

4.1.2 PIEMD - PIEMD

This reconstruction is the same as the previous one but we
add two BCG components (modelled using the PIEMD pro-
ﬁle) whose coordinates are ﬁxed to main large-scale haloes’.
These BCGs are modelled separately and do not follow the
scaling relations (Newman et al. 2013).
The BCG centred in the ﬁrst clump (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+20.0”,
-32.0”) can have a core radius between 3.5 and 50.0 kpc, the
cut radius can vary from 25 to 320 kpc, the ellipticity from
0.2 to 0.7, the orientation from 120 to 180 degrees and the
velocity dispersion from 100 to 500km/s.
As for the BCG centred at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (-40.0”, +40.0”):
its core radius can vary between 25 and 35 kpc, the cut ra-
dius from 670 to 730 kpc. Its ellipticity is allowed to vary
between 0.4 and 0.65 kpc, the orientation angle from 105 to
115 degrees and the velocity dispersion from 80 to 420 km/s.

4.1.3 NFW

This reconstruction, as in 4.1.1, has two cluster-scale haloes
but modelled using a NFW density proﬁle instead.
The clump ﬁxed at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+20.0”, -32.0”) away
from the cluster centre can have an orientation between 130
and 140 degrees, its velocity dispersion can vary between
500.0 and 2000.0 km/s and its scale radius varies from 50 to
280kpc and we let the ellipticity vary from 0.2 to 0.6.
The ellipticity of the second clump - ﬁxed at (δ R.A., δ Dec)=
(-40.0”, +40.0”)- can reach values up to 0.6, the orientation
is set between 105 and 115 degrees, the velocity dispersion
is set to vary between 500 and 1800km/s and its scale radius
between from 50 and 280kpc.
Even if the ellipticity intervals are quite large for both
clumps, after optimization these clumps do no reach val-
ues e (cid:38) 0.4. This is in agreement with Golse & Kneib (2002)
who demonstrated that the NFW proﬁle is ill-deﬁned for
large ellipticities as deﬁned in Lenstool. This will remain
true for both clusters NFW models.

4.1.4 NFW - PIEMD

We add two BCG components (modelled with a PIEMD
proﬁle) to the reconstruction in 4.1.3, in the same way as in
4.1.2. At this point, we realized that the NFW models were a
better ﬁt to ARES (than PIEMD for the large-scale haloes)
as the improvement of the logarithm of the Evidence in Table
2 shows (conﬁrmed as the proﬁle used to generate Ares’s
large-scale haloes upon the unblinding during the challenge).
Therefore, the following models, more complex as they also
take into account more distant structures or an Hernquist
proﬁle, were only modelled using the NFW proﬁle for the
large-scale haloes.
The last two models are ”post-unblinding” models. Once the

some structures in the outskirts of the cluster, out of the

includes six
This model, together with the model 4.1.7,
additional dark matter components located in the outskirts
of the cluster. This model is exactly like 4.1.4 with the
additional substructures.
The substructures are located at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+110.9”,
-118.4”); (+84.3”, -138,8”); (+136.0”, -127,98”); (+57.6”,
-83.2”); (-108,9”, +136,9”); (+111.3”, -75.0”) away from the
cluster’s centre. They are modelled with NFW proﬁles,
considered as

allowed to vary between 100 and 500km/s and their scale

4.1.6 NFW - HERNQUIST

The large-scale clumps are modelled as in 4.1.4. The BCGs,
on the other hand have a diﬀerent density proﬁle: the Hern-
quist proﬁle as described in Section 3.1.
The BCG located at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+20.0”, -32.0”) has a
core radius between 1.0 and 40.0 kpc. Its ellipticity can reach
values up to 0.4, the orientation varies between 90 and 180
degrees and the velocity dispersion can vary from 100 to 400
km/s.
For the BCG located at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (-40.0”, +40.0”) the
core radius is allowed to vary between 1.0 and 40.0 kpc, the
ellipticity from 0.1 to 0.7, the orientation from 90 to 180 de-
grees and the velocity dispersion between 90 and 400 km/s.

4.1.7 NFW - HERNQUIST +SUBS

For this model, the large-scale haloes and BCGs components
are modelled as in 4.1.6 and the distant substructures as in
4.1.5.

4.1.8 NFW - PIEMD + shapes

Last, we consider how taking into account the shapes of the
galaxy-scale haloes impacts the reconstruction. The large-
scale haloes and BCGs components are modelled as in 4.1.4
but we use SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to measure
the semi-major and semi-minor axis of the ﬁtted ellipsis of
each cluster galaxy which are then taken into account in the
modelling.

4.2 Hera

In spite of the unimodal appearance of the cluster and its
convergence contours in the bottom panel of Figure 1, Hera
is also modelled as a bimodal cluster. Indeed, if this cluster
is ﬁtted with only one dark matter central clump the χ 2 is
twice larger.
The cluster members of the input catalogue were taken into
account with mF814W < 24.0 and were modelled in the same
way for all models: parametrized by a PIEMD proﬁle with

lowed to vary between 60.0 and 100.0 km/s, a cut radius r(cid:63)
cut
with values from 1.0 kpc to 200.00 kpc, considered spherical,
with mag0 = 19.8 and following the scaling relations (Faber
& Jackson 1976).
Moreover, in the same way as for Ares, four massive galaxies
were more carefully modelled (indicated as green diamonds
in Figure 1), using a PIEMD density proﬁle and ﬁtted in the
same way for each model.
The galaxy labelled as 1 in Figure 1 is located at
(δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+25.91”, +26.98”) away from the cluster
centre,considered spherical, an angle position of 72 degrees
and a core radius of 0.07 kpc. Its cut radius rcut can vary
from 10.0 to 100.0 kpc and its velocity dispersion σ from
50.0 to 200.0 km/s.
The next one, labelled as 2 in Figure 1, is positioned at
(δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+60.38”, +20.2”), with a core radius of 0.31
kpc. Its ellipticity can go up to 0.5, the angle position is set
between -65.0 and 90.0 degrees, the cut radius rcut can vary
from 30.0 to 400.0 kpc and its velocity dispersion σ from
50.0 to 500.0 km/s.
The third halo of a massive galaxy (labelled as 3 in Figure 1)
is located at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (-19.665”, -11.078”) with a core
radius of 0.1 kpc. Its ellipticity can vary between 0.1 to 0.7,
the angle position from 22 to 90 degrees, the cut radius rcut
is allowed to vary between 8.0 to 150 kpc and the velocity
dispersion σ from 400 to 200.0 km/s.
Finally, the last one is a very massive galactic halo (labelled
as 4 in Figure 1) having a signiﬁcant impact in the total mass
distribution proﬁle. This halo is located at (δ R.A., δ Dec)=
(-7.0”, -46.0”) with a core radius of 0.1, an ellipticity set
between 0.1 and 0.7, an angle position allowed to vary be-
tween 75.0 to 90.0 degrees, a cut radius rcut between 8.0 and
250.0 kpc and a velocity dispersion σ between 40.0 and 600.0
km/s.
All the multiple images provided were included in the model
with a positional uncertainty of 0.5” and the optimization is
performed in the source plane. As for Ares we checked that
image plane and source plane models were giving similar
results.

4.2.1 PIEMD

±

2.00”.

This model contains two large-scale halos whose coor-
dinates are placed at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (0.00”, 0.00”) and
(δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+20.0”, +2.00”) away from the centre of
the cluster respectively (and no BCGs). They are allowed
to move around by
For the ﬁrst clump, we let the core radius vary from 5 kpc
to 37 kpc with a ﬁxed cut radius of 3000 kpc. The ellipticity
of this halo is allowed to vary values from 0.0 and 0.7, its
orientation angle from 0.0 to 180.0 degrees and its velocity
dispersion can vary from 400 to 1500 km/s. The second dark
matter clump can have a core radius with any value from
5 kpc to 40 kpc and cut radius, also ﬁxed, of 3000 kpc. Its
ellipticity can take any value from 0.0 to 0.7, its orientation
can vary from 0.0 to 180 degrees and the velocity dispersion
can vary from 600 to 1000 km/s.

4.2.2 PIEMD - PIEMD

We add two BCG components (modelled with a PIEMD
proﬁle) to the reconstruction in 4.2.1.
The BCG ﬁxed at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (0.0”, 0.0”) has a ﬁxed
core radius of 0.5 kpc and a cut radius that can vary from
30.0 to 450.0 kpc. Its ellipticity can go from 0.0 to 0.4, the
orientation from 5 to 90 degrees and the velocity dispersion
from 100 to 500 km/s.
The (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+20.0”, +2.00”) centred BCG has a
ﬁxed core radius of 1.0 kpc, the cut radius can vary from
20.0 to 400.0 kpc, the ellipticity from 0.0 to 0.3, the ori-
entation angle from 12.0 to 90.0 degrees and the velocity
dispersion between 100 and 500 km/s.

4.2.3 PIEMD - HERNQUIST

In this reconstruction, the two added BCGs to the model
4.2.1 are modelled using an Hernquist density proﬁle.
The BCG located at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (0.0”, 0.0”) has a ﬁxed
core radius of 0.5kpc. Its ellipticity can reach values up to
0.4, the orientation angle is allowed to vary from 10 to 90
degrees and the velocity dispersion from 100 to 500 km/s.
For the BCG located at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (+20.0”, +2.00”),
the core radius is ﬁxed to 1.0 kpc, the ellipticity can vary
from 0.0 to 0.3, the orientation angle from 6 to 90 degrees
and the velocity dispersion between 100 and 500 km/s.

4.2.4 NFW

This model, as in 4.2.1, has two large-scale haloes but
modelled using a NFW density proﬁle instead.
For the clump located at (δ R.A., δ Dec)= (0.0”, 0.0”), aligned
with the centre of the cluster we let the ellipticity vary from
0.0 to 0.7, its orientation from 50 to 180 degrees. It can
have a velocity dispersion between 500 and 1500 km/s and
scale radius varying from 50 to 280 kpc.

5 ESTIMATORS

In this section we present four estimators used to assess the
quality of our reconstructions and quantify the impact of the
systematic errors arising from the choice of density proﬁles
and conﬁgurations in the modelling of both Ares and Hera.

Relative error of each model on the density for Ares (left) and Hera (right). The vertical dashed lines represent the radius below which
there are multiple images.

5.1 Statistical quality assessment

We use several statistical estimators to assess the quality
of each reconstruction: the logarithm of the Likelihood, the
RMS (in arcseconds) in the image plane, the reduced χ 2,
the logarithm of the Evidence and the Bayesian Informa-
tion Criterion (following Lagattuta et al. 2016). The results
are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3 for Ares and Hera
respectively.
We would like to draw the reader’s attention to the fact
that all estimators are consistent with each other but us-
ing the logarithm of the Evidence appears to be a better
way to diﬀerentiate between models. On the other hand,
the RMS does not necessarily reﬂect the improvement of the
reconstruction. However, both the BIC and AICc strongly
penalize models including the distant substructures in the
modelling. Indeed, the greater number of free parameters in
these models would not be justiﬁed be even though they im-
prove the mass distribution at large radii as well as tighten
the cosmological constraints (see Figures 2 and 6, respec-

tively).
As expected, in the case of Ares, considering a NFW pro-
ﬁle for the large-scale potentials improves the modelling and
Model 7 (NFW - HERNQUIST + subs) gives the best ﬁt for
this cluster as it is the closest to the true mass distribution.
We show that taking into account the substructures in the
cluster’s outskirts for Ares leads to an improvement in the
modelling of
20%. Wide ﬁeld imaging around strong lenses
is thus crucial in order to detect such structures and include
them in future reconstructions.
For the model NFW-PIEMD + shapes, we see that this ad-
ditional information worsens the modelling of Ares with a
lower value of log(Evidence) than the model without. This
is in agreement with the true model as input cluster galax-
ies are spherical (Meneghetti et al. 2016) thus showing that
our modelling technique is sensitive to the shapes of clus-
ter members. As for Hera, the resulting ﬁt is similar for all
models. As expected, the reduced χ 2 values are larger than
those for Ares, as the latter was modelled parametrically

modelling technique.

5.2 Density proﬁles

In this section we present the comparison between the radial
density proﬁle for all of our models and the true one.
In order to compare our projected mass maps to the input
convergence map (with sources assumed at zs=9), the latter
is normalised by multiplying the value of every pixel by Σcrit
(at zs = 9, and assuming the input cosmology) in order to
have the associated surface mass density Σ(x, y) as:
Σ((cid:126)θ ) = κ((cid:126)θ )Σcrit ,
where:

Σcrit =

(10)

with c, the speed of light, G the Newtonian constant and
Ds, Dl and Dls the angular diameter distances between
observer-source, observer-lens and source-lens, respectively.
Our maps and the true one have the same ﬁeld of view and
spatial resolution.
For each model of Section 4, we compute the radial density
proﬁle and compare it to the true proﬁle in Figure 2.

(i) Ares:

∼

Regardless of the proﬁle used for the large-scale potentials
and BCGs, the mass distribution is well constrained within
5% inside the radius below which there are constraints-
∼
deﬁned as the radius of the circle enclosing all multiple im-
ages (except for the model PIEMD, which is overestimating
the cluster’s density by
14%). However, the density proﬁle
in the outskirts of the Ares cluster (beyond the black vertical
dashed line, representing the radius containing multiple im-
ages) tends to be underestimated by up to
30%. Including
the substructures in the modelling helps to better constrain
the mass distribution, with an improvement between
5%
to
20% in the most distant regions of the cluster. On av-
erage, the statistical error is about 5% of the signal for all
models, although for Model 1 (PIEMD), it varies from 4%
in the inner regions to up to 8% in the outskirts.
We also display in Figure 3 the bias on the estimation of ΩM
and w (i.e the absolute error between the true value and the

∼

∼

∼

mode of the distribution for each of our models, see Figure
6) depending on the bias on the total mass (inside the ra-
dius below which there are multiple images) for all of our
models of Section 4.1 for Ares (as the constraints on ΩM −
w
for Hera in Figure 7 are too wide to draw any conclusion).
As expected the larger the bias on the mass is, the larger
the bias on the cosmological parameters. The bias on the
mass is therefore a cosmological quality estimator. Also we
show that the equation of state parameter w is more aﬀected
by a larger bias on the cluster mass than ΩM. This result
is in agreement with Golse et al. (2002) where the authors
showed that the matter density parameter ΩM can be better
constrained than ΩΛ for a set of simple mock strong lenses.
In this work we conﬁrm that ΩM is less sensitive to the mod-
elling than w, even for more complex clusters such as Ares.

(ii) Hera:

−

∼

As expected, Hera is less constrained inside the radius below
which there are multiple images (within
15%) and the
density proﬁle at the very core of the cluster diﬀers signiﬁ-
cantly from the true distribution. The density proﬁle is well
constrained by all models up to the radius containing multi-
ple images. In the outskirts of the cluster, the density proﬁle
diﬀers from the true distribution from
40%
depending on the model. The statistical error is larger than
for Ares, especially for models 3, 4 and 6 , for which it varies
from

5% in the center up to 10

5.3 Relative bias on magniﬁcation

In this section, we detail how we compute the magniﬁcations
from our lens models and compare them to the true values.

scribing the distortion (in shape and size) of images is then:

To obtain the true magniﬁcation for each multiple image
we use the true convergence and shear maps at zs = 9 at
any location in the image plane covering a ﬁeld of view of
300”
However, to have the true magniﬁcation at the source’s red-
shift, we multiply the true convergence κ and shear compo-
nents γ1, γ2 by a normalizing factor:

We are interested in how the measured magniﬁcation evolves
with an increasing number of multiple images. To do so,
we run SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to extract and
measure the magnitudes on the F814W image (deeper thus
more arcs detected) of all the multiple images which are
then divided into ﬁve diﬀerent catalogues with increasing
magnitude thresholds in the F814W ﬁlter (being uniformly
distributed in the ﬁeld).
We then run each lens model presented in Sections 4.1 and
4.2 with all of the new multiple image catalogues (with dif-
ferent magnitude thresholds). We compute the relative bias
on magniﬁcation per multiple image as well as the 25-th
and 75-th percentiles of this distribution. Finally for each
magnitude catalogue we compute an average bias on the
magniﬁcation with:

δ µ = p75

where µ f it is the mode of the magniﬁcation distribution per
catalogue.
We show in Figure 4 the relative bias on magniﬁcation
as a function of the number of images taken into account
in the modelling for both clusters (top panel) and the
precision of our measurements (bottom panel). The bias
on the magniﬁcation is of the order of
20% for Ares.
This bias can go up to 40% for the smallest bins. The
magniﬁcations of the multiple images in Hera are less
constrained with an average bias of
30%. The relative bias
on magniﬁcation is not reduced by an increasing number of
constraints for either of the clusters. However, the precision
on magniﬁcation improves by a factor
4 when increasing
the constraints in the modelling as stated in Jauzac et al.
(2014). All models provide similar measurements of the
magniﬁcation and modelling galaxy clusters in a more
complex way is not translated into an improvement in the
accuracy or precision of magniﬁcation.
Taking into account the substructures in the cluster’s
outskirts leads to a very localised improvement of the
15% but remains constant within
magniﬁcation bias of

5.4 Cluster ellipticity and orientation

We use the mass maps generated for each model and the
normalised true convergence map (as explained in 5.2) to
compute the cluster ellipticity as a function of the major
semi-axis and its position angle for each model of Section 4.
We set a list of iso-surface density thresholds to ﬁt an ellipse
to each contour. As both clusters are bimodal, the highest
iso-density contour is set to be the one that encloses both
clumps.
The ellipticity is then computed as follows:

e =

b2
a2
a2 + b2 ,
−

(15)

where a and b are the measured major and minor semi-axes
respectively. The radial proﬁles of the ellipticity and of the
orientation angle for both clusters are shown in Figure 5.
For each panel the true values are given by the black line.
Overall, the values of all the models are in good agreement
with the true value in the inner regions (before the dashed
vertical line, representing the radius up to where we have
multiple images) but tend to diﬀer in the outskirts as our
models do not have constraints anymore, thus extrapolating
from the core region. The ellipticity in the outskirts of Ares
is underestimated but overestimated for Hera. The values of
the cluster’s orientation angle are recovered within 5 degrees
for Ares and within 10 degrees for Hera.
This estimator does not allow to discriminate between the
diﬀerent models as all models are in perfect agreement.

6 COSMOGRAPHY

In this section we investigate the impact of considering dif-
ferent cluster modellings on the estimation of cosmological
parameters.
We assess ﬁrst if the choice of diﬀerent density proﬁles for
the cluster components (large-scale potentials and BCGs)
has a signiﬁcant impact on constraining the ΩM and w pa-
rameter space.

Figure 5. Top panels: radial proﬁle of the cluster’s ellipticity. Bottom panels: radial proﬁle of the orientation angle. The dashed vertical
lines represents the limit for which we have multiple images. Left panels: Ares cluster. Right panels: Hera cluster.

We also analyse the systematic error introduced when us-
ing diﬀerent redshift catalogues for the background sources
(spectroscopic only, spectroscopy and photometry) for the
lens modelling.

6.1 Estimation of ΩM and w

As mentioned before, for each model we have (taking into ac-
count all multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts), the
cosmological parameters ΩM and w are left as free param-
eters. The constraints obtained are shown in Figure 6 for
Ares and Figure 7 for Hera.
Using either diﬀerent density proﬁles for the large-scale
clumps and BCGs provides similar constraints on the ΩM
and w parameter-space (within the 1σ contours) if a large
number of multiple images is available (with spectroscopic
redshifts and with a positional error of 0.5”) and if the model
is realistic enough (all but model 1: PIEMD,which has the
largest mass bias in Figure 3).
However, including in the modelling massive substructures
in the cluster’s outskirts translates into a decrease of the
statistical errors as the cosmological contours are smaller:
at the risk of biasing the results. Our work is in agreement
with these previous studies showing that massive structures

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2017)

in the outskirts of clusters do impact, not only the mass dis-
tribution but also the constraints on cosmological parame-
ters yielding smaller contours. Not only do the line-of-sight
structures introduce a systematic error in the strong lens-
ing modelling (eg. Bayliss et al. 2014; Giocoli et al. 2016)
but also distant massive structures in the lens plane have a
considerable impact in the position of multiple images (Tu
et al. 2008; Limousin et al. 2010) and thus on the mass con-
straints. Indeed, in Mahler et al. (2017) the authors evaluate
the impact of the presence of mass clumps in the outskirts of
the cluster core of Abell 2744 (Jauzac et al. 2016) to change
the mass proﬁle by
6% at 200kpc. McCully et al. (2017)
have shown that considering the environmental and line of
sight perturbations should not be taken aside in the mod-
elling as in doing so, the ﬁt does not reproduce the input
lens system parameters or the Hubble constant.
The contours obtained with Hera are,
in general, much
larger than those from Ares. This can be explained by the
fact that the redshift range of Ares’s sources is twice larger
than for Hera. By running one of Ares models with multiple
images only up to z
3.5, we checked that, the contours were
larger indeed. The widening of the contours might then not
be due to the number of images taken into account as seen
in Figure 9. The left panels show the constraints on the ΩM

- w parameter space for one of Ares conﬁgurations. Consid-
ering the same number of multiple images, but spanning a
twice larger range of redshift, provides tighter constraints
than those obtained with Hera.
Finally, we would like to point out that recovering cosmolog-
ical parameters with strong lenses has been until now per-
formed for unimodal clusters (or more simple clusters than
the FF) which would be the preferred conﬁguration for cos-
mography. Recently, Caminha et al. (2016) performed the
ﬁrst cosmography analysis with a Frontier Fields cluster,
AS1063, which is the most relaxed cluster of the sample. By
carefully selecting a sub-sample of secured multiple images
they achieve a rms of 0.3” and put constraints on the ΩM, w
and ΩΛ parameters.
However, we show in this work that complex and multimodal
clusters such as Ares can yield tight and competitive con-
straints on the ΩM - w parameter space.

6.2 Redshift catalogues

In this section we investigate how the estimation of robust
cosmological parameters is aﬀected by the availability of dif-
ferent sets of constraints. We extend this study for three of
the models for Ares in Section 4.1 (models 2, 3, 6).
These analyses have been only carried out for the Ares clus-
ter as it has three times more multiple images (see Table 1)
and the range of redshift is twice wider than for Hera.

6.2.1 Redshift range

We investigate ﬁrst whether there is a redshift range of back-
ground sources more eﬃcient to recover the input cosmology
and if photometric redshifts can complete our samples.
We split the redshift catalogue into four bins of redshift:

Bin1 as zs ≤
1.96,
Bin2 as 1.96 < zs ≤
Bin3 as 3.08 < zs ≤
Bin4 as zs > 3.68.

3.08,
3.68,

•
•
•
•

and we build the new multiple images catalogues as follows:
for each of the new four multiple images catalogue we keep
the images whose redshift is inside each bin as spectroscopic
and the rest as photometric redshifts which have been vir-
tually created with a precision of 0.04(1 + z) and assuming
there are no catastrophic errors. This precision is already
achievable with the HFF data: Castellano et al. (2016) de-
termined a typical photometric redshift error on the multiple
images in Abell 2744 and MACS 0416 of 3
5%. Of the 242
total images provided we keep
60 with spectroscopic in-
formation per bin and the rest with photometric accuracy.
We also study if it is preferable to only use spectroscopic
information or add photometric redshifts as constraints so
we also use multiple images catalogues with only images
belonging to each bin (having then
60 images, with spec-
troscopy). We compare, for each bin of redshift stated above,
the constraints on the ΩM-w parameter-space with photo-
metric redshifts as additional information or not.
The results are shown in Figure 8. For reference, the ﬁducial
models of Figure 6 are also shown (black constraints). First,
we show that considering only spectroscopic redshifts from a

−

∼

∼

certain redshift range (blue points) biases the estimation of
cosmological parameters whatever the redshift bin consid-
ered is, the bias being similar whichever the proﬁle and/or
conﬁguration used are for the same bin considered.
By completing these spectroscopic redshifts catalogues with
multiple images with photometric information (red points),
spanning the ranges in redshift not covered by them, we re-
cover unbiased cosmology (golden star) in most cases or at
least reduce this bias. Note that, if cosmological parameters
are still biased, it is the equation of state parameter w which
is more aﬀected than ΩM.
Photometric redshifts are then a useful piece of additional
information to take into account in the modelling and com-
pleting the spectroscopic catalogue if the latter covers only
a narrow redshift range.

6.2.2 Photometric families

∼

Considering multiple images from a restricted range of red-
shift leads to an estimation of wider constraints (which are
biased) on the ΩM and w parameter space whatever the mass
distribution of the cluster is. This bias is due to the narrow
range of redshifts considered and not to a reduced number
of multiple images considered as seen below.
In this section, we consider as constraints a reduced cat-
alogue of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts by
creating two similar catalogues (but with a diﬀerent red-
shift distribution) which contain
60 images and spanning
all the redshift range available (see histograms in Figure 9).
We have considered the same three mass models (id 2, 3
and 6) of Section 4.1 for Ares. For clarity, we only show the
results obtained for one of them in Figure 9 as the results
were very similar for the 3 of them.
In the left and middle panels we show in black the con-
straints obtained with the ﬁducial model NFW- HERN-
QUIST of (Section 6), on top are the constraints with the
two reduced catalogues. As we can notice, the cosmological
parameters are unbiased.
We investigate if adding an increasing number of families of
multiple images with photometric redshifts (spanning all the
redshift range) in the modelling translates into an improve-
ment in the cosmology estimation (i.e a smaller systematic
than statistical error). This is shown in the right panels of
Figure 9 where the systematic and statistical errors (errors
bars) are plotted as a function of the increasing number of
photometric families taken in account. The coloured circles
show the bias on ΩM, the triangles on w. We observe the
same behaviour for the three models, where ΩM is less af-
fected by than w the modelling and the statistical errors are
smaller than the systematic uncertainties. w is systemati-
cally underestimated. We do not report, however, any trend
with the increasing number of photometric families.

6.3 On the positional uncertainty of the multiple

images

Throughout this paper, we have assumed an uncertainty of
0.5” for the position of multiple images, closer value to the
RMS in the image plane thus providing a reduced χ 2
1.
We show in Figure 10 the bias on the estimation of ΩM and
w for three positional errors of the multiple images assumed

in the modelling for two models of Section 4.1 for Ares. This
bias is the lowest for a positional uncertainty of the order
of the RMS. However, this Figure also shows that underes-
timating the uncertainties on the observations can lead to
biased constraints on the ΩM-w parameter space.

7 CONCLUSIONS

We have analysed two mock galaxy clusters, Ares and Hera
from the FF-SIMS Challenge (Meneghetti et al. 2016), both
complex and bi-modal, comparable to the FF clusters. We
have investigated the systematic errors in the strong lensing
parametric modelling arising from the choice of the density
proﬁles and conﬁgurations as well as from the availability
of constraints (spectroscopic or photometric redshifts) and
therefore the impact on the retrieval of robust cosmological
parameters.
Our main conclusions are the following:

(i) Galaxy clusters are not isolated systems and can
present large structures in the cluster outskirts (Jauzac
et al. 2016; Fo¨ex et al. 2017). With this work we provide
further evidence that distant massive substructures in the
lens-plane of galaxy clusters have a signiﬁcant impact on
the mass distribution. Wide-ﬁeld imaging around massive
clusters is thus needed to account for these structures in the
modelling. In an era of precise cosmology, we show that the
cluster’s environment cannot be ignored in order to yield a

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2017)

more precise mass reconstruction and therefore competitive
constraints on ΩM and w.

(ii) As expected, the smaller the bias on the mass, the
smaller the bias on cosmological parameters. The bias on
the total mass is a quality indicator for the cosmological
constraints. On the other hand, magniﬁcation, the cluster’s
ellipticity and orientation do not allow to discriminate
between models (assuming the same modelling technique).

(iii) Considering a positional error of 0.5”, the estimation
of cosmological parameters is not aﬀected by the choice of
diﬀerent mass proﬁles or conﬁgurations when a suﬃcient
number of constraints is available (nim >

60).

∼

(iv) The bias on the estimation of cosmological pa-
rameters is the lowest for a positional uncertainty of the
order of the RMS. Underestimating the uncertainty on the
observations can lead to biased constraints on the ΩM-w
parameter space.

(v) Considering multiple images, from a restricted range
of redshift leads to an estimation of biased cosmological
parameters. Taking into account multiple images from a
broader range of redshift with photometry information can
correct this bias or, at least, reduce it.

(vi) We do not report any trend between an increasing

number of photometric families taken into account in the
modelling and a more precise estimation of ΩM and w.

(vii) ΩM is less sensitive to systematic errors than w this
latter being systematically underestimated when recovered
biased.

Stronger constraints can be obtained by combining the es-
timates on ΩM and w from several strong lensing clusters
(D’Aloisio & Natarajan 2011). We show that, not only uni-
modal (or simpler clusters than Ares and Hera; Jullo et al.
2010; Caminha et al. 2016), but also more complex and mul-
timodal clusters can yield competitive constraints. Upcom-
ing surveys such as James Webb Space Telescope will make
strong lensing cosmography a very powerful tool by detect-
ing an even larger number of arcs than currently with HST.
