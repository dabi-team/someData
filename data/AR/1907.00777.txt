Introduction

The concept of statistical convergence was introduced by H. Fast[7] and independently by H. Steinhaus
in [23] as an applicable concept that generalizes the classical concept of usual convergence. This
convergence was studied for sequences of numbers in [8, 9, 20], for sequences of elements in uniform
spaces in[4, 16], for sequences of elements in paranormed spaces in [2, 11], for sequences of elements
in topological groups in [6], for sequences of elements in metric spaces in [3], for sequences of elements
in topological vector spaces in [15], and for sequences of elements in topological vector lattices in [1].
There are articles [17, 18] which study statistical convergence of double sequences and generalized
sequences. There are generalizations of this concept through ideals in the articles [12, 13, 14, 21].
Almost all applicable statistical convergence ideas depend on asymptotic densities of sets. These sets
may be subsets of N, N × N, N × N × N, ... , where N represents the set of all natural numbers.
So, if the concept of asymptotic density for subsets of directed sets is introduced, then the concept
of statistical convergence for nets can be introduced. This is done in the present article. For this
purpose, a natural restriction is made on directed sets. The restriction is the following:

For the directed sets (D, ≤) considered in this article, to each β ∈ D, the set {α ∈ D : α ≤ β}

is ﬁnite and the set {α ∈ D : α ≥ β} is inﬁnite.
It is assumed that all directed sets considered in this article satisfy this condition.

All directed sets considered through N, N × N, N × N × N, ..., in earlier studies for statistical

convergence satisfy this condition. Thus a common extension is proposed in this article.

There is an article [14] which discusses statistical convergence of nets through ideals, but not
through a concept of asymptotic density. The present article presents statistical convergence of nets
through a concept of asymptotic density for directed sets.

There are articles related to summability through statistical convergence (see [8, 22]) and articles
for generalizations of asymptotic density (see [5]). Let us ﬁrst introduce a concept of asymptotic
density for our purpose.

Example 2.2 Let D = {(x1, x2, x3) : xi ∈ N, i = 1, 2, 3}. Deﬁne ≤ on D by:
(x1, x2, x3) ≤ (y1, y2, y3) if and only if x1 ≤ y1, x2 ≤ y2 and x3 ≤ y3. Then to each (y1, y2, y3) ∈ D,
the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ D : (x1, x2, x3) ≤ (y1, y2, y3)} is ﬁnite, and it contains y1 · y2 · y3 elements.
Let A = {(x, x, x) : x ∈ N }. Then δ(A; D) = 0.

Example 2.3 Let D = N be the directed set with the usual order relation. Then to each α ∈ D,
Dα = {β ∈ D : β ≤ α} has precisely α elements. The asymptotic density introduced in Deﬁnition 2.1
for D coincides with the classical asymptotic density for subsets of N .

Deﬁnition 2.4 Let (D(1), ≤(1)) and (D(2), ≤(2)) be two directed sets. Let D = D(1) × D(2). Deﬁne
the product order ≤ in D by: (x1, x2) ≤ (y1, y2) if and only if x1 ≤(1) y1 and x2 ≤(2) y2. Observe
again that to each α ∈ D, the set Dα = {β ∈ D : β ≤ α} is ﬁnite. This deﬁnition can be extended to
any Cartesian product of a ﬁnite number of directed sets.

Remark 2.5 If A ⊆ D(1), and if δ(A; D(1)) exists then δ(A × D(2); D) = δ(A; D(1)); for the notations
used in the previous Deﬁnition 2.4. Moreover, if B ⊆ D(2) and δ(A; D(1)) = 0 then δ(A × B; D) =
δ(A; D(1)).

Proposition 2.6 Let D be one among the directed sets N, N ×N, N ×N ×N, · · · , when N is endowed
with the usual order, and the other sets are endowed with the corresponding product orders. Then, to
each γ ∈ D,
δ({α ∈ D : α not greater than or equal to γ}; D) = 0, and hence δ({α ∈ D : α ≥ γ}; D) = 1.

Proof. It is easy to verify the relation δ({x ∈ D : α ≥ γ}; D) = 1.

Example 2.7 Consider the set N with the following diﬀerent order relation. m ≤ n if and only if m
divides n. Then N is a directed set with the properties mentioned in the introduction. Fix k ∈ N \{1}.
Let A = {n ∈ N : n is not greater than or equal to k} = N \{k, 2k, 3k, · · · } = N \kN (say).
If m ∈ N \kN and if Dm = {n ∈ N : n ≤ m}, then, for i ∈ Dm, i ∈ N \kN and hence A ∩ Dm = Dm.
This shows that lim supm→∞
If m = ki for some i > 1, then Dm = {n ∈ N : n ≤ m} = {1, k, 2k, · · · , ki}, when A ∩ Dm = {1}.
|A∩Dm|
|Dm| = 0. In particular, δ(A; N ) does not exist. However, if A = {n ∈
This shows that lim inf m→∞
N : n is not greater than or equal to 1} = N \{1}, then δ(A; N ) = 1. Now, let D = N \{1} and
consider the order relation deﬁned above. To each β ∈ D, let Dβ = {α ∈ D : α ≤ β}. For a ﬁxed
γ ∈ D, let B = {α ∈ D : α ≥ γ}. Then lim supβ∈D

|A∩Dm|
|Dm| = 1.

|B∩Dβ |
|Dβ | = 1 > 0.

Deﬁnition 2.8 A directed set is said to satisfy the condition (*), if to each ﬁxed γ ∈ D, for the set
B = {α ∈ D : α ≥ γ}, it is true that lim supβ∈D

|B∩Dβ |
|Dβ | > 0, when Dβ = {α ∈ D : α ≤ β}.

3 Statistical convergence

Deﬁnition 3.1 Let (xα)α∈D be a net in a topological space (X, τ ) and let x ∈ X. Let us say that
(xα)α∈D converges statistically to x in (X, τ ), if, to each U ∈ τ such that x ∈ U , the relation
δ({α ∈ D : xα /∈ U }; D) = 0 is true.

Let us ﬁrst verify the uniqueness of statistical limits in Hausdorﬀ spaces.

Proposition 3.2 Suppose (xα)α∈D be a net in a Hausdorﬀ space (X, τ ) such that it converges sta-
tistically to x and y in X. Then x = y.

Proof. Suppose x 6= y. Then there are disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V . Then

{α ∈ D : xα /∈ U } ∪ {α ∈ D : xα /∈ V } = {α ∈ D : xα /∈ U ∩ V } = D.

But δ({α ∈ D : xα /∈ U } ∪ {α ∈ D : xα /∈ V }; D) = 0 and δ(D; D) = 1; which is a contradiction.
Therefore x = y. Observe that δ(A ∪ B; D) = 0 whenever δ(A; D) = 0 and δ(B; D) = 0, for subsets
A and B of D.

Proposition 3.3 Let (D(1), ≤(1)), (D(2), ≤(2)) and (D, ≤) be as in Deﬁnition 2.4. Let (X, τX ) and
(Y, τY ) be given topological spaces. Let τ be the product topology on X × Y . Let (xα)α∈D(1) and
(yβ)β∈D(2) be two nets in X and Y respectively. Then ((xα, yβ))(α,β)∈D converges statistically to some
(x, y) in (X × Y, τ ) if and only if (xα)α∈D(1) converges statistically to x in (X, τX ) and (yβ)β∈D(2)
converges statistically to y in (Y, τY ).

Proof. Suppose (xα)α∈D(1) converges statistically to x in (X, τX ) and (yβ)β∈D(2) converges statisti-
cally to y in (Y, τY ). Fix U ∈ τX and V ∈ τY such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V . Then

δ({α ∈ D(1) : xα /∈ U }; D(1)) = 0 and
δ({β ∈ D(2) : yβ /∈ V }; D(2)) = 0.

By Remark 2.5,

δ({α ∈ D(1) : xα /∈ U } × D(2) ∪ D(1) × {β ∈ D(2) : yβ /∈ V }; D) = 0.

Thus,

δ({(α, β) ∈ D : (xα, yβ) /∈ U × V }; D) = 0.

This implies that ((xα, yβ))(α,β)∈D converges statistically to (x, y) in (X × Y, τ ). Conversely, assume
that ((xα, yβ))(α,β)∈D converges statistically to (x, y) in (X × Y, τ ). Fix an open neighborhood U of
x in (X, τX ). Then

δ({(α, β) ∈ D : (xα, yβ) /∈ U × Y }; D) = 0.

So, δ({α ∈ D(1) : xα /∈ U }; D(1)) = 0. This implies that (xα)α∈D(1) converges statistically to x in
(X, τX ). Similarly, (yβ)β∈D(2) converges statistically to y in (Y, τY ).

Proposition 3.4 Let (X, τX ) , (Y, τY ) and (X × Y, τ ) be as in the previous Proposition 3.3. Let
(xα)α∈D be a net that converges statistically to some x in (X, τX ), for some directed set (D, ≤). Let
(yα)α∈D be a net that converges statistically to some y in (Y, τY ). Then ((xα, yα))α∈D converges
statistically to (x, y) in (X × Y, τ ). On the other hand, if ((xα, yα))α∈D converges statistically to
some (x, y) in (X × Y, τ ) then (xα)α∈D converges statistically to x in (X, τX ) and (yα)α∈D converges
statistically to y in (Y, τY ).

3

Proof. Suppose (xα)α∈D converges statistically to x and (yα)α∈D converges statistically to y.

Let U be an open neighbourhood of x in X and V be an open neighbourhood of y in Y. Then

δ({α ∈ D : xα /∈ U } ∪ {α ∈ D : yα /∈ V }; D) = 0.

T hat is, δ({α ∈ D : (xα, yα) /∈ U × V }; D) = 0.

So, ((xα, yα))α∈D converges statistically to (x, y).

Conversely assume that ((xα, yα))α∈D converges statistically to (x, y). Let U be an open neigh-

bourhood of x. Then

δ({α ∈ D : (xα, yα) /∈ U × Y }; D) = 0.

That is, δ({α ∈ D : xα /∈ U }; D) = 0. This implies that (xα)α∈D converges statistically to x. Similarly
(yα)α∈D converges statistically to y.

Remark 3.5 Proposition 3.3 and Proposition 3.4 can be extended to any Cartesian product of a ﬁnite
number of spaces.

Proposition 3.6 Let (X, τX ) and (Y, τY ) be topological spaces and let f : (X, τX ) → (Y, τY ) be a
function which is continuous at a point x in X. Let (xα)α∈D be a net that converges statistically to
some x in (X, τX ). Then (f (xα))α∈D converges statistically to f (x) in (Y, τY ).

Proof. Let U be an open neighbourhood of f (x) in (Y, τY ). Then there is an open neighbourhood
V of x in (X, τX ) such that f (V ) ⊆ U . Then {α ∈ D : f (xα) /∈ U } ⊆ {α ∈ D : xα /∈ V } and
δ({α ∈ D : xα /∈ V }; D) = 0. So, δ({α ∈ D : f (xα) /∈ U }; D) = 0. This proves that (f (xα))α∈D
converges statistically to f (x) in (Y, τY ).

Proposition 3.7 Let D(1), D(2) and D be as in Proposition 3.3. Let (xα)α∈D(1) and (yβ)β∈D(2) be
two nets in a topological vector space X over the ﬁeld of real numbers or the ﬁeld of complex numbers.
Let (aα)α∈D(1) be a net of scalars. If (xα)α∈D(1) , (yβ)β∈D(2) and (aα)α∈D(1) converge statistically to
x, y and a respectively, then (xα + yβ)(α,β)∈D and (aαyβ)(α,β)∈D converge statistically to x + y and ay
respectively.

Proof. Use Proposition 3.3 and Proposition 3.6. Observe that, it has been assumed that, the addition
and the scalar multiplication in a topological vector space are jointly continuous.

Proposition 3.8 Let (xα)α∈D and (yα)α∈D be two nets in a topological vector space X; with respect to
a common directed set D. Let (aα)α∈D be a net of scalars. If (xα)α∈D, (yα)α∈D and (aα)α∈D converge
statistically to x, y and a respectively, then (xα + yα)α∈D and (aαyα)α∈D converge statistically to x + y
and ay respectively.

Proof. Use Proposition 3.4 and Proposition 3.6.

Remark 3.9 One may derive results similar to Proposition 3.7 and Proposition 3.8 for the structures,
topological groups, topological rings, and topological algebras.

4 Statistically Cauchy nets

The concept of statistically Cauchy nets is to be introduced for uniform spaces. For the concepts
and notations in uniform spaces, one may refer to the book of Kelley [10] on General topology.
The following deﬁnition agrees with the known deﬁnitions for statistically Cauchy sequences and
statistically Cauchy double sequences(see [8, 17, 19]).

4

Deﬁnition 4.1 Let (X, U) be a uniform space with a uniformity U. A net (xα)α∈D in X is said to be
statistically Cauchy if, for given U ∈ U, there is a γ ∈ D such that

δ({α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ}; D) = 0.

It is easy to verify that every Cauchy net is a statistically Cauchy net, and hence every converging
It is also possible to prove that statistical

net is a statistically Cauchy net in a uniform space.
convergence implies statistical Cauchyness in a uniform space.

Proposition 4.2 Let D be a directed set. Then every statistically convergent net (xα)α∈D in a
uniform space is statistically Cauchy.

Proof. Let (xα)α∈D be a net which converges statistically to x in a uniform space (X, U). Fix U ∈ U.
Find a symmetric V ∈ U such that V ◦ V ⊆ U . For this V , δ({α ∈ D : (xα, x) /∈ V }; D) = 0 and hence
there is a γ ∈ D such that (xγ , x) ∈ V . Then {α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ U } ⊆ {α ∈ D : (xα, x) /∈ V }. Thus,
δ({α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ}; D) = 0. This proves that (xα)α∈D is statistically Cauchy.

Let us recall the order in product of two directed sets described in Deﬁnition 2.4.

Proposition 4.3 Let (xα)α∈D be a net that is statistically Cauchy in a uniform space (X, U). Then
for given U ∈ U, there is a γ ∈ D such that
δ({(α, β) ∈ D × D : (xα, xβ ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ, β ≥ γ}; D × D) = 0.

Proof. Fix U ∈ U. Find a symmetric V ∈ U such that V ◦ V ⊆ U . For this V, there is a γ ∈ D such
that δ({α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ V, α ≥ γ}; D) = 0. Since

{(α, β) ∈ D × D : (xα, xβ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ, β ≥ γ} ⊆ {(α, β) ∈ D × D : (xα, xγ) /∈ V

or (xβ , xγ) /∈ V, α ≥ γ, β ≥ γ}

⊆ ({α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ V, α ≥ γ} × D)

∪(D × {β ∈ D : (xβ, xγ) /∈ V, β ≥ γ}),

by Remark 2.5,

δ({(α, β) ∈ D × D : (xα, xβ ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ, β ≥ γ}; D × D) = 0.

Proposition 4.4 Let D(1), D(2) and D be as in Proposition 3.3. Let (X, UX) and (Y, UY ) be two
uniform spaces. Let U be the product uniformity on X × Y . Let (xα)α∈D(1) and (yβ)β∈D(2) be two nets
in X and Y respectively. Then ((xα, yβ))(α,β)∈D is statistically Cauchy in (X × Y, U) if (xα)α∈D(1) is
statistically Cauchy in (X, UX ) and (yβ)β∈D(2) is statistically Cauchy in (Y, UY ). Moreover, if D(1)
and D(2) satisfy the condition (*) mentioned in Deﬁnition 2.8, and ((xα, yβ))(α,β)∈D is statistically
Cauchy in (X × Y, U), then (xα)α∈D(1) is statistically Cauchy in (X, UX ) and (yβ)β∈D(2) is statistically
Cauchy in (Y, UY ).
Proof. The proof follows from the set relation: For U ∈ UX , V ∈ UY , γ1 ∈ D(1) and for γ2 ∈ D(2), it
is true that

{(α, β) ∈ D : ((xα, xγ1 ), (yβ, yγ2))

/∈ U × V, (α, β) ≥ (γ1, γ2)}
= ({α ∈ D(1) : (xα, xγ1 ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ1} × {β ∈ D(2) : β ≥ γ2})

∪({α ∈ D(1) : α ≥ γ1} × {β ∈ D(2) : (yβ, yγ2) /∈ V, β ≥ γ2}).

Proposition 4.5 Let (X, UX ) and (Y, UY ) be two uniform spaces. Let U be the product uniformity on
X × Y . Let (xα)α∈D and (yα)α∈D be nets in X and Y respectively. Then ((xα, yα))α∈D is statistically
Cauchy in X × Y if and only if (xα)α∈D is statistically Cauchy in X and (yα)α∈D is statistically
Cauchy in Y.

5

Proof. Suppose (xα)α∈D and (yα)α∈D be statistically Cauchy. Fix U ∈ UX and V ∈ UY . Then there
is a γ ∈ D such that δ({α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ}; D) = 0 and δ({α ∈ D : (yα, yγ) /∈ V, α ≥
γ}; D) = 0. The statistically Cauchyness of ((xα, yα))α∈D follows from the relation:

{α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ U or

(yα, yγ) /∈ V, α ≥ γ}

⊆ {α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ} ∪ {α ∈ D : (yα, yγ) /∈ V, α ≥ γ}.

Conversely, assume that ((xα, yα))α∈D is statistically Cauchy. Fix U ∈ U. Then there is a γ ∈ D

such that

δ({α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ}; D) = δ({α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ U or (yα, yγ) /∈ Y × Y, α ≥ γ}; D) = 0.

This shows that (xα)α∈D is statistically Cauchy. Similarly (yα)α∈D is statistically Cauchy.

Proposition 4.6 Let f : (X, U) → (Y, V) be a uniformly continuous function from a uniform space
(X, U) into a uniform space (Y, V). Let (xα)α∈D be a statistically Cauchy net in (X, U). Then
(f (xα))α∈D is a statistically Cauchy net in (Y, V).

Proof. Fix V ∈ V. Find a U ∈ U such that (f (x), f (y)) ∈ V , whenever (x, y) ∈ U . Find a γ ∈ D such
that δ({α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ}; D) = 0. Then δ({α ∈ D : (f (xα), f (xγ )) /∈ V, α ≥ γ}; D) = 0,
because {α ∈ D : (f (xα), f (xγ)) /∈ V, α ≥ γ} ⊆ {α ∈ D : (xα, xγ) /∈ U, α ≥ γ}.

Remark 4.7 Let (X, τ ) be a topological vector space. The usual uniformity on X implies the follow-
ing: A net (xα)α∈D is Cauchy in X if and only if for every neighbourhood U of 0 there is a γ ∈ D
such that

δ({α ∈ D : xα − xγ /∈ U, α ≥ γ}; D) = 0.

One can derive the following Proposition 4.8 and Proposition 4.9 which are similar to Proposition 3.7
and Proposition 3.8.

Proposition 4.8 Let D(1), D(2), D, (xα)α∈D(1) , (yβ)β∈D(2) , (aα)α∈D(1) and X be as in Proposition
3.7. Let x ∈ X and a be a scalar. If (xα)α∈D(1) , (yβ)β∈D(2) and (aα)α∈D(1) are statistically Cauchy,
then (xα + yβ)(α,β)∈D, (aαx)α∈D(1) and (axα)α∈D(1) are statistically Cauchy.

Proof. Use Proposition 4.6 and Proposition 4.4.

Proposition 4.9 Let (xα)α∈D, (yα)α∈D and X be as in Proposition 3.8. If (xα)α∈D and (yα)α∈D
are statistically Cauchy, then (xα + yα)α∈D is statistically Cauchy.

Proof. Use Proposition 4.5 and Proposition 4.6.

5 Net Spaces

Corresponding to sequence spaces, net spaces can be constructed. The following construction is similar
to the construction given in [20]. The following construction uses the Propositions 3.7, 3.8, 4.8 and
4.9. Since veriﬁcations part is a direct one, it is omitted.

Let (X, τ ) be a topological vector space with the natural uniformity U that induces the topology

τ . Let D be a ﬁxed directed set. Let M = {(xα)α∈D : {xα : α ∈ D}is a bounded subset of X}.

Let Mcy = {(xα)α∈D ∈ M : (xα)α∈D is statistically Cauchy}.
Let Mct = {(xα)α∈D ∈ M : (xα)α∈D converges statistically in X}.
Let M0 = {(xα)α∈D ∈ M : (xα)α∈D converges statistically to zero in X}.

6

To each balanced neighbourhood U of zero in X, deﬁne a function pU on M by

pU ((xα)α∈D) = sup{λ ≥ 0 : λxα ∈ U, ∀α ∈ D},

and deﬁne a subset NU of M by

NU = {(xα)α∈D ∈ M : pU ((xα)α∈D) < 1}.

Then the collection of the sets of the form NU forms a local base for M that makes M into a topological
vector space under pointwise algebraic operations. Also Mcy is a closed linear subspace of M . If (X, U)
is a complete topological vector space, then M is a complete topological vector space and Mct and
M0 are closed linear subspaces of M .
