Abstract

We report precision measurements of the Casimir interaction at larger separation distances be-

tween the Au-coated surfaces of a sphere and a plate in ultrahigh vacuum using a much softer

cantilever of the dynamic atomic force microscope-based setup and two-step cleaning procedure

of the vacuum chamber and test body surfaces by means of UV light and Ar-ion bombardment.

Compared to the previously performed experiment, two more measurement sets for the gradient

of the Casimir force are provided which conﬁrmed and slightly improved the results. Next, addi-

tional measurements have been performed with a factor of two larger oscillation amplitude of the

cantilever. This allowed obtaining meaningful results at much larger separation distances. The

comparison of the measurement data with theoretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the

dissipative Drude model to describe the response of Au to the low-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld

ﬂuctuations shows that this theoretical approach is experimentally excluded over the distances from

250 to 1100 nm (i.e., a major step forward has been made as compared to the previous work where

it was excluded up to only 820 nm). The theoretical approach using the dissipationless plasma

model at low frequencies is shown to be consistent with the data over the entire measurement range

from 250 to 1300 nm. The possibilities to explain these puzzling results are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Extensive studies of the Casimir force in the last two decades lead us to conclude that

this ﬂuctuation-induced quantum phenomenon is of considerable importance for both funda-

mental physics and its technological applications (see the monograph [1] and reviews [2–4]).

For almost half a century it was generally believed that the Lifshitz theory [5] provides

quite a satisfactory description of the van der Waals and Casimir forces acting between the

closely spaced surfaces made of various materials. In so doing the single input parameter

needed to make theoretical predictions was the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity

of the interacting bodies describing their response to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Contrary

to expectations, several precise measurements performed in the last ﬁfteen years resulted

in contradictions between experiment and theory which are sometimes called the Casimir

puzzle and Casimir conundrum to specify the problems arising for metallic and dielectric or

semiconductor materials, respectively [6, 7].

The Casimir puzzle consists in the fact that theoretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory

for metallic test bodies obtained with inclusion of the relaxation properties of conduction

electrons are excluded by the measurement data of all precise experiments at short sepa-

rations [8–17]. The dielectric response of metals used in computations is found from the

optical data extrapolated down to zero frequency by means of the Drude model, where the

relaxation parameter γ describes the energy losses of conduction electrons. It is puzzling

also that if one puts γ equal to zero (as if there were no energy losses at low frequencies)

the Lifshitz theory comes to good agreement with the measurement data of the same ex-

periments [8–17] (recall that all of them have been performed at separations below 750 nm

between the interacting bodies). This means that the dissipationless plasma model, which

is in fact applicable only at high frequencies in the region of infrared optics, works well for

some reasons even at low frequencies characteristic of the normal skin eﬀect. The problem is

aggravated by the fact that for metals with perfect crystal lattices the Casimir entropy cal-

culated within the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model violates the Nernst heat theorem

although the same satisﬁes it if the plasma model is used [18–23].

In a similar way, the term Casimir conundrum is applied in reference to the fact that the-

oretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory for dielectrics and dielectric-type semiconductors

obtained with the inclusion of the dc conductivity are excluded by the measurement data

2

of several experiments [24–28]. If the conductivity of dielectric materials at room tempera-

ture is disregarded, the Lifshitz theory comes to agreement with the same data [24–29]. By

analogy with the case of metals, it has been proven that the Casimir entropy calculated in

the framework of the Lifshitz theory violates the Nernst heat theorem if the conductivity

of dielectrics is taken into account which is otherwise satisﬁed [30–32]. Considering that all

dielectric materials possess a rather small but nonzero electric conductivity at any nonzero

temperature, the situation should be considered as paradoxical.

Resolution of the problems arising in the Lifshitz theory for both metallic and dielectric

materials is of major importance for applications of the Casimir force in nanotechnology.

With the decrease in separations between the moving parts of microelectromechanical devices

below a micrometer, the Casimir force becomes dominant. Because of this, it has long been

proposed [33] that the next generation of micro- and nanodevices will exploit the Casimir

force for their functionality. In the early twenty ﬁrst century, extensive studies of the role

of Casimir force in microdevices have been conducted and a lot of devices driven by the

Casimir force, such as oscillators, switches, microchips etc., have been proposed [34–48].

The description of their functionality on the basis of the Lifshitz theory essentially depends

on whether the dissipative Drude or the dissipationless plasma model is used in extrapolation

of the optical data to low frequencies. This places strong emphasis on the Casimir puzzle

and Casimir conundrum as they impact fundamental physics as well as technology.

All precision measurements of the Casimir interaction mentioned above lead to meaningful

results at relatively short separations below 750 nm between the test bodies (with the single

exception of measuring the Casimir-Polder force [29] relevant to the Casimir conundrum).

After the experiment [16] on measuring the diﬀerence Casimir force was performed, where

the theoretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude and plasma models diﬀer

by up to a factor of 1000, an exclusion of the former within this separation range was

conclusively established. In so doing the role of diﬀerent background eﬀects, such as the

surface roughness [49, 50], variations in the optical data [51], patch potentials [52, 53] etc.,

as well as the validity of calculation procedure (including the role of deviations from the

proximity force approximation [54–58]), were investigated in detail.

Special attention was paid to the background forces due to patch potentials which become

much larger than the Casimir force at separations of a few micrometers. Thus, in Ref. [59]

an attempt was undertaken to extract the Casimir force from up to an order of magnitude

3

larger forces between a centimeter-size spherical lens and a plate, presumably caused by the

patch potentials, by means of some ﬁtting procedure. The obtained Casimir force was found

to be in better agreement with the Drude model approach. It was shown [60], however, that

depending on uncontrolled imperfections on the lens surface the obtained results may agree

with equal ease either with the Drude or the plasma model approaches.

Taking into account the signiﬁcance of the above problems in Casimir physics, which

remain unsolved for almost twenty years, in Ref. [61] an upgraded atomic force microscope

(AFM)-based technique was developed and an advanced surface cleaning procedure was

used in order to eliminate the role of patch potentials and make progress towards a precision

measurement of the Casimir interaction at larger separations. For this purpose both interior

surfaces of the vacuum chamber and Au-coated test bodies (the sphere and the plate) were

successively cleaned by means of UV light and Ar ions. Another improvement was the use

of a much softer cantilever. These allowed the separation-independent and low residual

potential diﬀerence as well as a sixfold decrease of the systematic error in measuring the

gradient of the Casimir force. The measurement data have been compared with theoretical

predictions of the Lifshitz theory obtained using the extrapolations of the optical data of

Au to zero frequency by means of the Drude and plasma models. As a result, the Drude

model approach was excluded and the plasma model approach conﬁrmed by the data up to

the sphere-plate separation distance of 820 nm.

In this paper, we continue the investigation of the Casimir force between an Au-coated

sphere and a plate at larger separation distances using an upgraded technique and the

cleaning procedure of Ref. [61]. The results reported in the rapid communication [61] were

based on a single measurement set (the gradient of the Casimir force was measured for 21

times at each separation over the range from 250 to 950 nm with a step of 1 nm). Here, we

discuss the data of two additional measurement sets and present the mean results from all

the three sets. The comparison of these results with theoretical predictions of the Lifshitz

theory made using two diﬀerent statistical procedures leads to the exclusion of the Drude

model approach and conﬁrmation of the plasma model approach up to the separation of

850 nm.

Next we present additional measurements with increased oscillation amplitude of the

cantilever (20 nm instead of 10 nm in Ref. [61]) which decreased by the factor of 1.375

the systematic error in measuring the frequency shift. The obtained measurement data are

4

again compared with theoretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the two alternative

statistical approaches. As a result, the Drude model approach is excluded up to much larger

separation distance of 1100 nm. The plasma model approach is found to be consistent with

the data up to the separation of 1.3 µm. The importance and possibilities to test the Lifshitz

theory experimentally at even larger separations are discussed.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II we brieﬂy present the upgraded AFM-

based setup and some additional details of the cleaning procedure by means of UV light

and Ai-ion bombardment. Section III is devoted to the measurement results with relatively

small oscillation amplitude of the cantilever and their comparison with theory. In Sec. IV

the measurement results at larger separations are presented and compared with theoreti-

cal predictions. In Sec. V the reader will ﬁnd our conclusions and a discussion of future

prospects.

II. UPGRADED SETUP WITH A TWO-STEP SURFACE CLEANING

We have measured the gradient of the Casimir force between an Au-coated hollow glass

sphere and an Au-coated polished Si wafer by means of the AFM-based setup working in the

frequency-shift mode in ultrahigh vacuum. The main steps in making these measurements

are the following.

The force-sensitive element in our setup shown schematically in Fig. 1 is a rectangular

cantilever. As compared to previous experiments [12–15, 17], the precision of force measure-

ments here was improved by increasing the sensitivity of the cantilever through a decrease

of its spring constant. The cantilever spring constant is given by [62]

k =

wv3Y
4L3 ,

(1)

where w, v, and L are the width, thickness, and length of the cantilever beam, respectively,

and Y is its Young’s modulus. As is seen from Eq. (1), the spring constant can be eﬀectively

decreased by reducing the thickness of the beam.

This was achieved by means of the etching process. At ﬁrst, the cantilever was rinsed

with buﬀered HF solution (BOE 6:1) for 1 min. followed by DI water to remove the oxide

layer. Then the cantilever was etched with 60% KOH solution at T = 50 ◦C for 55 s. Mild

agitation by hand was used to obtain a uniform etching. Relatively high concentration of

5

KOH solution and high temperature were necessary to achieve suﬃciently smooth surfaces

after etching [63]. The spring constant was measured using the thermal oscillation spectrum

of the cantilever, as discussed in Ref. [64], both before and after the etching process and

the values k = 0.013 and 0.0063 N/m were obtained, respectively. As a result, the resonant

frequency of the cantilever ω0 was reduced from its original value 4.877

104 rad/s to

×

3.608

×

104 rad/s (see Fig. 2). These measurements were made in ambient conditions at

room temperature.

The ﬁrst test body of our setup is the hollow glass sphere of approximately 43 µm radius.

It was made from liquid phase which leads to almost perfectly spherical shape with less than

0.1% relative diﬀerence along any two perpendicular axes. The sphere was baked at 60 ◦C

for two hours to remove volatile components. Then it was picked up using a bare optical

ﬁber and attached to a cantilever using a very small amount of conducting silver epoxy (see

Fig. 1). The process of attachment was performed under an optical microscope.

Following the attachment of the sphere, the Au coating was applied on the cantilever and

the sphere using an E-beam evaporator at a pressure 5

10−6 Torr

×

0.7

×

≈

10−3 Pa. In

contrast to thermal evaporators used in previous experiments, the E-beam evaporator leads
to smoother surfaces and lower roughness. The Au coating speed was 2 ˚A/s and the thickness

of the Au layer was 118

±

1 nm. After the measurements of the Casimir force were completed,

the radius of the Au-coated sphere was measured to be R = 43.466

0.042 µm using a

±

calibrated scanning electron microscope and software ImageJ to precisely determine the

sphere boundary. Quantiﬁcation of the deviation from a perfect sphere was done by ﬁnding

the diﬀerence between the maximum and minimum diameters for any two perpendicular

line scans of the sphere diameter in ImageJ. The respective diﬀerence in the sphere radii

was taken into account in the total error of R indicated above. As a result, the error

in determination of the sphere radius was decreased as compared to previously reported

in the literature (see, e.g., Refs. [12, 65, 66]). The rms roughness on the sphere surface

δs = 1.13 nm was also measured when the work was completed. After the Au coating, the

spring constant of a cantilever with sphere attached increased to k = 0.007353 N/m, and its

resonant frequency decreased to ω0 = 0.9444

104 rad/s in ultrahigh vacuum.

×
The Au-coated sphere-cantilever system was attached to two block piezoelectric actuators.

The cantilever is electrically grounded (see Fig. 1). The cantilever motion was monitored

using a ﬁber optical interferometer with a laser light wavelength of 1550 nm. For so doing,

6

single mode 1550 nm ﬁbers were used. To improve the ﬁnesse of the Fabry-Perot cavity of

the interferometer, the reﬂectance of the top side of the cantilever was increased with a layer

of Au of 40 nm thickness.

The second test body of our setup is a polished Si wafer of 1

1 cm2 area and of 500 µm

×

thickness used as a plate. It can be considered inﬁnitely large as compared to the sphere (in

Fig. 1 the test bodies are not shown to scale). The Si wafer was HF washed and then coated

with 120

±

1 nm of Au using an E-beam evaporator. This resulted in the rms roughness

δp = 1.08 nm measured after ﬁnishing the Casimir force measurements. The plate was

mounted on a piezoelectric tube which is used to precisely control its position. The tube, in

its turn, was mounted on a XY Z linear translational stage which is used to perform a coarse

approach of the plate to the sphere. The ﬁne movement of the plate due to application of

voltage to the piezoelectric tube was measured by means of the second interferometer using

laser light of 520 nm wavelength. There is also a connection to a function generator which

can be used to apply diﬀerent voltages to the plate (see Fig. 1).

The experimental setup was placed inside a stainless steel vacuum chamber consisting of

a mechanical scroll pump and a turbo pump connected in series to achieve a pressure down

to 10−9 Torr

1.3

×

≈

10−7 Pa, and an ion pump for further reduction (see Refs. [12, 17]

for details). During the force measurements only the ion pump was used in order to reduce

the background mechanical noise to a minimum. In fact ultrahigh vacuum conditions are

necessary for precise measurements of the Casimir force and are closely connected to the

absence of contaminations on the Au surface. As discussed in Sec. I, the latter causes the

electric patch eﬀect and can lead to a distance-dependent residue potential V0 between two

Au surfaces. In addition, the desorption of contaminants from the chamber walls and their

deposition on the Au surfaces leads to a time-dependent V0. To reduce the drift rate of V0, an

ultra low and stable pressure is necessary. We have measured the drift rate of V0 at diﬀerent
10−5 Pa and

chamber pressures and found that it was 0.1 mV/min at 1

10−7 Torr

less than 0.005 mV/min at 5

It has been known that to reach ultrahigh vacuum in diﬀerent experiments of surface

physics the vacuum chamber is cleaned through a baking step when its temperature is

increased to more than 200 ◦C to desorb all contaminants which are then pumped out.

This procedure, however, cannot be used in precise Casimir force measurements because

changes in temperature would lead to misalignment of the two interferometers due to thermal

7

expansion.

The removal of contamination on the Au sphere-plate surfaces used in Casimir force

measurements by means of Ar-ion bombardment was suggested in Ref. [17]. An application

of this method has helped to lower the residual potential V0 by an order of magnitude and

thus, reduce the detrimental role of electrostatic forces. However, the ions emitted by the

Ar-ion gun mostly hit the surfaces of the sphere and the plate leaving almost untouched the

contaminants on the chamber walls. As a result, after some period of time, the V0 increases

due to desorption of contaminants from the chamber walls and their redeposition on the Au

surfaces of the samples.

In Ref. [61] the use of a two-step cleaning procedure in measurements of the Casimir force

was reported. It consisted of the illumination of the entire interior of the vacuum chamber

by UV light followed by the Ar-ion bombardment of the interacting surfaces. The UV light

has long been used for removing contaminants from both the chamber walls and surfaces

of the test bodies [67–72]. UV radiation can reﬂect oﬀ the inner surfaces of the chamber

leading to the excellent coverage of its entire volume. The UV light can desorb water vapor

and decompose oxidative hydrocarbon from the chamber walls.

In this experiment, the UV lamp (UVB-100 Water Desorption System, RBD Instruments,

Inc.) with dimensions of 10.5(cid:48)(cid:48) = 26.67 cm length and 1.3125(cid:48)(cid:48) = 3.3338 cm diameter has

been used. It was attached to the top of the vacuum chamber using a 2.75(cid:48)(cid:48) = 6.985 cm

ﬂange (see Fig. 1). This lamp uses a hot cathode mercury discharge tube as an emitter. It

emits a combination of light with 185 nm wavelength (30%) and with 254 nm wavelength

(70%). The radiated power was approximately 2 W at 185 nm and 5 W at 254 nm. The UV

light with 185 nm wavelength is important because it is absorbed by oxygen and thus, leads

to the generation of ozone, whereas the UV light with the 254 nm wavelength is absorbed by

most hydrocarbons and ozone leading to their ionization and disintegration. The resulting

volatile species can then be pumped out of the vacuum chamber.

The two-step cleaning procedure was performed as described below. At the ﬁrst step,

the vacuum chamber was pumped down to the pressure of 9

10−9 Torr

1.2

×

≈

10−6 Pa

×

by means of the scroll mechanical pump and the turbo pump. Next the UV lamp (see

Fig. 1) was turned on for 10 min. During the UV cleaning process, the valve of the ion

pump was closed to avoid its contamination. The volatile species released by the UV light

caused the increase of chamber pressure to 8

10−7 Torr

×

1.1

×

≈

10−4 Pa. These species

8

were pumped out by the turbo pump and mechanical pump. As a result, organic and water

contaminants on the Au surfaces of the test bodies and chamber walls were removed leading

to a modiﬁcation of the residual potential V0 between the sphere and the plate.

To study this modiﬁcation, a rough measurement of the V0 was done for a sphere-plate

separation of 1 µm before and after the UV cleaning. We applied diﬀerent voltages Vi to

the plate and by trial and error found the two voltages V1 and V2 which lead to the same
V0)2

frequency shift. Taking into account that the frequency shift is proportional to (Vi

−

(see Sec. III), V0 was estimated as (V1 + V2)/2. This results in V0 = 49.6

0.3 mV before

±

cleaning. During and immediately after (up to 60 min.) the UV treatment, measurements

of the frequency shift were not possible due to the ﬂuctuating interferometer signal induced

by the thermal eﬀects of the UV radiation. We have found that after the UV lamp was

turned oﬀ for 60 min., and the signal was stabilized, V0 reaches a higher value in the region

of 100–200 mV. The reason for this increase may be the exposure of inorganic contaminants

on the sample surface including the possible formation of nonstable oxides of Au.

In the second step, Ar-ion-beam bombardment was used to remove any additional organic

and also inorganic contaminations, including Au oxide, from the sample surfaces [17, 73, 74].

For this purpose, the sphere-plate separation was increased up to 500 µm and the Ar gas from

the Ar-ion gun (see Fig. 1) was released into the chamber until the pressure reached the value

of 1.2

×

10−5 Torr

1.6

×

≈

10−3 Pa (during the Ar-ion cleaning, the ion pump remained shut

oﬀ). The Ar ions were accelerated with a 500 V potential diﬀerence. This value was selected

so that the kinetic energy of Ar ions is high enough to break chemical bonds of Au oxide and

organic molecules but low enough to avoid any sputtering of Au surfaces. The anode current

of 4 µA was used as the ion beam ﬂux. The ﬁlament current was 2.1 A. At these conditions,

the Ar-ion cleaning was done in several 5-min stages. After each cleaning stage the turbo

pump gate valve was opened until the pressure reached 5

10−9 Torr

×

0.7

×

≈

10−6 Pa in

less than 30 min. Next the value of V0 was measured. This was repeated several times

until V0 reached the smallest value of few millivolts. The complete Ar-ion cleaning time was

typically between 20–30 min.

To reduce mechanical noise, the turbo and mechanical pumps were valved and then turned

oﬀ and the ion pump was turned on. As a result, the two-step cleaning procedure using the

UV light and Ar ions provides us with clean sphere-plate surfaces with low and time-stable

V0 ready for the force measurements at a ultrahigh vacuum of 5

III. MEASUREMENT RESULTS USING SMALL OSCILLATION AMPLITUDE

OF THE CANTILEVER AND COMPARISON WITH THEORY

As mentioned in Sec. I, we perform measurements of the gradient of the Casimir force in

the frequency-shift mode which is often referred to as frequency modulation. In so doing,

the cantilever with attached sphere is set to oscillate above a plate so that the separation

distance between them varies harmonically with time t as

a(t) = a + A cos ωrt,

(2)

where ωr is the resonant frequency of the cantilever under the inﬂuence of the Casimir,

electric or any other force and A is the oscillation amplitude. Changes in the resonant

frequency ∆ω = ωr

−

ω0, where ω0 is the proper resonant frequency of the cantilever measured

when it is far away from the plate, is detected. The feedback using a phase-locked loop (see

Fig. 1) allows one to keep the cantilever oscillating at its current resonant frequency with

constant amplitude [12, 62].

In our experiment the sphere is subjected to the Casimir force F and electric force Fel

caused by the constant voltages Vi applied to the plate and the residual potential diﬀerence

V0:

Then, in the linear regime, the frequency shift is given by [12, 62]

Ftot(a) = F (a) + Fel(a).

where C = ω0/(2k). The nonlinear corrections to this equation are investigated in Ref. [12].

The oscillation amplitude A in Eq. (2) should be chosen from the condition that nonlinear

corrections to Eq. (4) are negligibly small.

Substituting Eq. (3) in Eq. (4) and using the exact expression for the electrostatic force

between a metallic sphere and plate [1, 75], after the diﬀerentiation with respect to a one

Here, the parameter κ is deﬁned by cosh κ = 1 + a/R and (cid:15)0 is the permittivity of a free

space.

The ﬁrst three measurement sets were taken over the separations exceeding 250 nm. The

oscillation amplitude of the cantilever in all the three sets was chosen to be A = 10 nm.

According to Fig. 14 of Ref. [12] this ensures that the nonlinear corrections to Eq. (4) are

negligibly small. The two-step cleaning procedure described in Sec. II was done prior to the

beginning of each measurement set.

In each of the three sets, the measurements have been performed in the following way.

Ten diﬀerent voltages Vi (i = 1, . . . , 10) with the step of 0.01 V and eleven with ﬁxed Vi

(i = 11, . . . , 21) were sequentally applied to the plate and the cantilever frequency shift

was measured as a function of sphere-plate separation at time intervals corresponding to

0.14 nm. The frequency-shift signals at every 1 nm separation were found by interpolation

(details on the data acquisition are given in Ref. [12]).

In the ﬁrst, second, and third

sets, Vi (i = 1, . . . , 10) between the range (–0.04 V, 0.06 V), (–0.049 V, 0.051 V), and (–

0.049 V, 0.051 V), respectively, were applied. In the ﬁrst set, Vi (i = 11, . . . , 21) was equal

to 0.01 V, whereas in the second and third sets to 0.001 V corresponding to the diﬀerent

values of V0 (see below). The relative separation between the sphere and the plate zrel was

controlled by application of voltage to the piezoelectric tube situated below the Au-coated

plate (see Fig. 1). The interference fringes from the 520-nm ﬁber interferometer were used to

calibrate the distance moved by the plate. The absolute sphere-plate separation was deﬁned

as a = z0 + zrel, where z0 is the separation at the closest approach determined for each of

the measurement sets separately during electrostatic calibration.

The calibration of the setup, i.e., precise determination of the absolute values of param-

eters C, V0, and z0, was performed with corrections for the mechanical drift as described

in Ref. [12]. According to Eq. (5), at any separation the frequency shift ∆ω is described

by the parabolic function of Vi

−

V0. By ﬁtting the parabolas to the measured ∆ω, one

ﬁnds V0 from the position of the parabola maximum and γ from the quadratic coeﬃcient.

The obtained values of V0 over the entire measurement range from 250 to 1200 nm with

a step of 1 nm for the ﬁrst, second, and third sets are shown as dots in Figs. 3(a), 3(b),

and 3(c), respectively. From Fig. 3 it is seen that after the two-step cleaning procedure the

residual potential diﬀerence is almost independent of separation (compared with strongly

separation-dependent V0 in Fig. 2 of Ref. [17] measured between uncleaned surfaces). The

11

best ﬁt of the straight line V0 = Ka + b to these data leads to the following mean values of

V0 and the parameters K and b:

Next, we performed the least squares ﬁt of the analytic expression for γ in Eq. (6) to

the value of γ obtained from ﬁtting the measurement data for the frequency shift ∆ω to

the parabolas. This was done at diﬀerent separations with almost separation-independent

results for the calibration constant C and the separation at the closest approach z0 (compare

with Ref. [12]). The obtained mean values of these parameters are

for the ﬁrst, second, and third measurement sets, respectively. Note that the above values for

the calibration constant are almost an order of magnitude larger than that found in Ref. [12].

This is explained by the fact that now we use a softer cantilever with much smaller spring

constant k. Note also that the values of C are determined independently for each set of

data, i.e., for each experiment. The small random variations in C are probably from some

uncontrolled eﬀects of the cleaning process particular to that experiment.

For each of the three measurement sets, the 21 values of the gradient of the Casimir force

F (cid:48)(a) = ∂F/∂a at each separation distance with a step 1 nm were found from Eq. (5). The

mean measured Casimir forces for each set were obtained by averaging over 21 repetitions and

their random errors were determined at the 67% conﬁdence level. These random errors were

added in quadrature to the systematic errors mostly determined by the systematic error in

measuring the frequency shift (in the measurement sets 1–3 it was equal to 5.5

10−2 rad/s).

×

In this way, the total errors in each of the three measurement sets have been obtained as

functions of separation. Then the mean gradients of the Casimir force were averaged over
the three measurement sets. The total errors of the mean force gradients ¯F (cid:48) obtained

12

by averaging over the three sets is given by the mean of the total errors found for each

measurement set separately as described above [76].

The measurement results for the gradient of the Casimir force obtained from the three

sets are shown as crosses in Fig. 4(a-d) over the separation range from 250 to 950 nm (at

larger separations the data are not informative). The vertical arms of the crosses indicate the

total error in measuring the force gradient at the 67% conﬁdence level. The horizontal arms

are determined by the constant error in measuring the absolute separations ∆z = 0.5 nm.

For better visualization only each third data point is plotted in Fig. 4.

We now compare experiment and theory. The thicknesses of the Au coatings on the sphere

and the plate allow one to consider these bodies as made up entirely of Au in calculations of

the Casimir force [1]. At the relatively large separations considered in this work, the surface

roughness with rms characterized in Sec. II leads to only negligibly small contribution which

can be taken into account perturbatively. For a small ratio a/R < 0.022 the calculation of

the gradient of the Casimir force can be performed within the proximity force approximation

with inclusion of the ﬁrst-order corrections to this approximation in a/R [54–58] computed

with inclusion of the real material properties. As a result, the gradient of the Casimir force

acting between a sphere and a plate is given by

Numerical computations of the gradient of the Casimir force have been performed by

Eqs. (7)–(10) in the framework of the two approaches discussed in Sec. I, i.e., by using εl

The computational results are presented in Fig. 4(a–d) as a function of separation by

the bottom and top lines obtained using the Drude and the plasma model approaches,

respectively. The width of the lines characterizes the size of the theoretical error which is

largerly determined by inaccuracies in the optical data of Au.

From Fig. 4 one can conclude that the theoretical predictions using the Drude model ap-

proach (i.e., taking into account the energy losses by conduction electrons) are excluded by

the data over the separation range from 250 to 850 nm. As to the plasma model approach,

which disregards the energy losses of conduction electrons, it is consistent with the measure-

ment data over the entire separation region. Similar results have been obtained previously

in the separation range up to 420 nm with the help of the dynamic AFM [12, 17] and in

the separation range up to 750 nm with the help of micromechanical torsional oscillator

[1, 2, 8–11, 16]. In Ref. [61] only one of the three measurement sets, presented in this paper,

allowed an exclusion of the Drude model approach in the region of separations from 250 to

820 nm.

The obtained results are conﬁrmed using another method of comparison between ex-

periment and theory which considers the diﬀerences between mean experimental ¯F (cid:48)
theoretical F (cid:48)

theor gradients of the Casimir force. These diﬀerences are plotted as dots in

expt and

Fig. 5 with a step of 1 nm by the top and bottom sets found using the Drude and the

14

plasma model approaches for F (cid:48)

theor, respectively. In doing so the experimental gradients are

the mean values obtained from the three measurement sets. The lower and upper solid lines

in Fig. 5 are formed by the smoothly joined boundary points of the conﬁdence intervals for
the diﬀerences ¯F (cid:48)
expt −
in the quantity ¯F (cid:48)
expt −
known total experimental error of ¯F (cid:48)

theor. The width of these intervals is equal to twice the total error
F (cid:48)

theor. The latter is found by combining in quadrature the already
expt and the total theoretical error of F (cid:48)

theor, which is

F (cid:48)

determined by the errors arising from the inaccuracy of the optical data and from the cal-

culation of the force gradient at the separation distance determined with an error ∆z (see

Refs. [1, 9] for details). In the inset, the region of separations from 650 to 950 nm is shown

on an enlarged scale.

The meaning of the conﬁdence band in between the solid lines is the following. If the

theoretical approach is consistent with the data within some separation interval at the 67%

conﬁdence level, no less than 67% of the dots in this interval should belong to the conﬁdence

band. On the other hand, the theoretical approach is excluded by the data within some

interval at the same conﬁdence level if more than 33% of the dots fall outside the conﬁdence

band [1, 9, 78]. From Fig. 5 one can see that the plasma model approach is consistent with

the data over the entire measurement range from 250 to 950 nm. At the same time, the

Drude model approach is excluded by the data at all separations below 850 nm (note that

although some dots of the top set belong to the conﬁdence band at separations from 770

to 850 nm, the number of these dots does not reach 67% of all the dots belonging to this

interval).

Thus, the consideration of three measurement sets allows us not only to conﬁrm the

results obtained in Ref. [61] from a single set, but also to increase the upper boundary of

the separation interval up to 850 nm, where the Drude model approach is excluded by the

data.

IV. COMPARISON WITH THEORY OF THE MEASUREMENT RESULTS

WITH LARGER OSCILLATION AMPLITUDE

Next we have performed one more set of measurements of the gradient of the Casimir

force with much larger separation of the closest approach between the sphere and the plate.

This allows the use of a larger oscillation amplitude of the cantilever A

20 nm while

≈

15

preserving the linearity of Eq. (4).

After ﬁnishing the third measurement set it was checked to conﬁrm that the vacuum

conditions in the chamber remain stable. Because of this, it was not necessary to repeat

the two-step cleaning procedure done previously before each of the ﬁrst three measurement

sets. Measurements have been performed in the separation region from 600 nm to 2 µm in a

similar way to the ﬁrst three sets but the values of the applied voltages have been changed

for larger ones. Ten diﬀerent voltages Vi (i = 1, . . . , 10) with a step of 0.01V varied in the

interval (–0.092 V, 0.108 V) whereas eleven ﬁxed voltages Vi (i = 11, . . . , 21) were equal to

0.008 V close to V0.

The calibration of the setup was performed as described in Sec. III. First the residual

potential diﬀerence V0 was determined at each separation with a step of 1 nm. The obtained

results are shown by the dots in Fig. 6 as a function of separation. Similar to Fig. 3,

the residual potential diﬀerence is almost separation-independent. This conﬁrms that the

surfaces of both test bodies are suﬃciently clean and ready for the force measurements. The

best ﬁt of the straight line V0 = Ka + b to these data results in K = 3.23

10−4 mV/nm

×

and b = 7.50 mV in close analogy to the results obtained in the ﬁrst three measurement sets
(see Sec. III). The mean value of the V0 in this case was found to be ¯V0 = 7.92 mV.

Next the separation at the closest approach z0 = 571.9

1.1 nm and the calibration

±
105 s/kg were determined from the ﬁt as described above.

constant C = (6.342

0.004)

×

±

The latter is again in agreement with the values obtained in the ﬁrst three measurement

sets.

Then the 21 values of the gradient of the Casimir force at each separation with a step

of 1 nm were calculated using Eq. (5). These values were averaged and the random error

was found at the 67% conﬁdence level as a function of separation. The systematic error in

measurements of the frequency shift for this set was equal to 4.0

10−2 rad/s. The decrease

×

of this error as compared to the value used in Sec. III is due to the fact that with the larger

amplitude of the cantilever oscillations the corresponding interferometer signal is increased.

This increases the signal-to-noise ratio leading to a reduced error in the determination of

the cantilever frequency shift from the sphere-plate interaction forces. This error is used in

the calculation of the systematic error in measurements of the force gradient by Eq. (4) and

combined in quadrature with the random error to obtain the total experimental error in the
gradient of the Casimir force ¯F (cid:48).

16

The measured gradients are shown as crosses in Fig. 7(a,b) over the separation region

from 600 nm to 1.3 µm. The arms of the crosses indicate the total error in measuring the

force gradient and in measuring the absolute separations ∆z = 1.1 nm. Only each third

cross is plotted in Fig. 7 to make the ﬁgure more informative.

The theoretical force gradients are computed as described in Sec. III. The computational

results obtained using the Lifshitz theory and the optical data for Au extrapolated down to

zero frequency by means of either the Drude of the plasma models are shown in Fig. 7 as

functions of separation by the bottom and top lines, respectively. As is seen in this ﬁgure,

the theoretical predictions using the dissipationless plasma model are consistent with the

measurement data over the entire range from 600 nm to 1.3 µm. From the same ﬁgure, we

can conservatively conclude that the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the dissipative

Drude model for extrapolation are excluded at all separations up to 1.1 µm. Thus, the

range of separations where the Drude model is excluded by the data has been signiﬁcantly

extended.

Now we compare with theory the measurement data obtained at larger separations with

increased oscillation amplitude using another statistical approach discussed in Sec. III. The
diﬀerences between ¯F (cid:48)
top and bottom sets of dots are obtained using F (cid:48)

theor are plotted in Fig. 8 as dots with a step of 1 nm. The

theor calculated using the Drude and plasma

expt and F (cid:48)

model approaches, respectively. The two solid lines are formed by the boundary points of
the conﬁdence intervals for ¯F (cid:48)

theor determined as discussed in Sec. III. In the inset,

F (cid:48)

expt −

the region of largest separations from 1 to 1.3 µm is shown on an enlarged scale to gain a

better understanding.

From Fig. 8 it is seen that all the points of the bottom set belong to the conﬁdence interval,

i.e., the plasma model approach is consistent with the data. The Lifshitz theory combined

with the Drude model approach is excluded by the data over the region of separations from

0.6 to 1.1 µm. In the intervals belonging to this range more than 33% of dots lie outside

the conﬁdence band. Therefore, the second method of comparison between experiment and

theory leads to the same conclusions as the ﬁrst one which means that in this experiment

the region of separations where the Drude model approach is excluded is extended up to

1.1 µm.

17

V. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

In the foregoing, we have presented a description of the experiment on measuring the

gradient of the Casimir force between metallic surfaces of a sphere and a plate cleaned

by means of a two-step cleaning procedure using the UV light and Ar-ion bombardment.

Compared to Ref. [61], two additional measurement sets within the same separation range are

reported here, as well as the measurement results at larger separations with a factor of two

larger amplitude of the cantilever oscillations. The latter allowed one to signiﬁcantly increase

the range of separations where the experiment discriminates between the two theoretical

approaches used in the literature on Casimir physics. Speciﬁcally, theoretical predictions

based on the Lifshitz theory in combination with the dissipative Drude model for conduction

electrons were excluded by the measurement data up to the separation of 1.1 µm (to compare

with 820 nm in Ref. [61]).

As discussed in Sec. I, both the Casimir puzzle for metallic test bodies and the Casimir

conundrum for dielectric and semiconductor ones are the problems which still remain to

be solved. Prior to this there already was a reasonably good picture of the experimental

situation concerning the Casimir puzzle at separations below a few hundred nanometers,

but the situation at separations above 0.8 µm remained completely unresolved. This made

harder the theoretical solution to the problem and called for precise measurements of the

Casimir interaction in the micrometer separation range. Several experiments of this kind

directed to the resolution of the Casimir puzzle and Casimir conundrum have been proposed

recently [79–83].

The main improvements made in the experiment presented here are the use of much

softer cantilever, which allowed the increase of the calibration constant by up to an order

of magnitude, and implementation of the two-step cleaning procedure by means of the UV

light and Ar ions, which resulted in ultra clean surfaces of both the internal walls of vacuum

chamber and of the test bodies at ultrahigh (< 5

10−9 Torr

10−6 Pa) and stable

vacuum. This allowed to reach low (a few mV) and stable residual potential diﬀerence

which was independent of separation for the regular (not specially selected) samples. The

introduction of these tools has made it possible to discriminate between the theoretical

predictions with inclusion and neglect of the dissipative relaxation of conduction electrons

in three measurement sets with oscillation amplitude of cantilever equal to 10 nm up to

18

larger separation distances. As a result, the Drude model approach was excluded by the

data over the separation range from 250 to 850 nm, and the plasma model approach was

found to be consistent with the data.

It was checked that in the separation range from 0.6 to 2 µm the oscillator used is still in

the linear regime when the oscillation amplitude is increased to 20 nm. With this increased

oscillation amplitude, the measurements of the gradient of the Casimir force have been

repeated and compared with the same two theoretical approaches.

It is found that the

plasma model approach neglecting the relaxation of conduction electrons is again consistent

with the data over the entire measurement range from 0.6 to 1.3 µm. The Drude model

approach taking into account the relaxation properties of conduction electrons was excluded

over the separation range from 0.6 to 1.1 µm. Thus, by the results of measurements with 10-

and 20-nm oscillation amplitudes of the cantilever the Drude model approach is excluded

by the data over the separation range from 250 to 1100 nm.

The problem of why the Lifshitz theory is in contradiction with the measurement data

when it takes into account the relaxation properties of conduction electrons at low frequen-

cies is discussed in the literature but there is yet no consensus on how this puzzle can

be explained. In Refs. [61, 83, 84] it was hypothesized that a material system might not

respond similarly to electromagnetic ﬁelds with nonzero ﬁeld strength and to ﬂuctuations

with zero ﬁeld strength but nonzero dispersion. This hypothesis does not necessarily as-

sume a violation of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem, but might be connected with the

phenomenological character of the Drude model which describes well the response of metals

to real electromagnetic ﬁelds on the mass-shell but fails to give an adequate description for

ﬂuctuations that are not on the mass-shell. Future investigations will shed new light on this

problem.
