1. Introduction
In a recent review [1] the cross sections of α-induced reactions for target nuclei in the mass
range A ≈ 20 − 50 were studied. For comparison of cross sections of diﬀerent targets at various
energies the method of reduced cross sections σred and reduced energies Ered [2] was used:

The reduced energy Ered takes into account the diﬀerent heights of the Coulomb barrier in the
systems under consideration, whereas the reduced reaction cross section σred scales the measured
total reaction cross section σreac according to the geometrical size of the projectile-plus-target
system. (All energies are given as Ec.m. except explicitly noted.) In the A ≈ 20 − 50 mass
range under study the total reaction cross section σreac can often be taken from the dominating
(α,n) or (α,p) reaction channel. It was found in [1] that most of the experimental cross sections
show a general and smooth trend for σred vs. Ered. The two outliers 36Ar and 40Ar show
signiﬁcantly smaller cross sections; however, this ﬁnding is based only on one very old experiment
[3]. Surprisingly, two recent experiments on 23Na [4] and 33S [5] show unexpected huge cross
sections. In addition, the data for 23Na [4] show a steeper energy dependence, and the data for
33S show a ﬂatter energy dependence compared to most of the other nuclei in this mass region.
The present study presents two extensions to the recent review [1]. First, a relation between
the reduced energy Ered and the most eﬀective energy E0 for astrophysical reaction rates (the

 
 
 
 
 
 
so-called Gamow window) is derived. Second, the review [1] is updated with two data sets for
the previous outlier 23Na which were presented at this NPA-7 conference [6, 7] and have been
published now [8, 9]. These new data for 23Na show that 23Na should not be considered as
outlier any more. Some further information on the other outlier 33S was already given in [10].

with the charge numbers ZP and ZT of projectile and target, the reduced mass number
AP +AT , and the plasma temperature T9 in 109 Kelvin. Although it has been shown
Ared = AP AT
that the underlying simple approximation S(E) ≈ const. does not hold exactly [11], the energy
E0 is still a reasonable estimate for the most eﬀective energy, and the energy window around
E0 is usually called Gamow window.

According to Eq. (1), the corresponding reduced energy Ered,0 is given by

From the exponents of 1/3 in Eq. (6) already a relatively smooth dependence of Ered,0 on the
mass and charge numbers of projectile and target can be expected. A closer inspection of Eq. (6)
shows that there is a further compensation between the ﬁrst and second factor in Eq. (6) which
leads to a reduced Gamow energy Ered,0 which is almost independent of target charge and mass
for α-induced reactions (ZP = 2, AP = 4). The ﬁrst factor increases from light nuclei (with
NT ≈ ZT and thus AT /ZT ≈ 2) towards heavier nuclei (with NT ≈ 1.5 ZT or AT /ZT ≈ 2.5).
The second factor decreases with increasing target mass number AT . Some numerical examples
for f (ZP , ZT , AP , AT ) are f (20Ne) = 2.367, f (51V) = 2.288, and f (208Pb) = 2.165. In the mass
range under study f varies only by a few per cent, leading to

for the mass range under study. Explicitly, the numbers are Ered,0 ≈ 0.284 MeV for T9 = 1,
Ered,0 ≈ 0.451 MeV for T9 = 2, and Ered,0 ≈ 0.591 MeV for T9 = 3.

3. Update for 23Na + α
The total reaction cross section of α + 23Na is dominated by the 23Na(α,p)26Mg reaction at low
energies. The 23Na(α,n)26Al reaction has a negative Q-value of about −3 MeV.

Two new experimental data sets for the 23Na(α,p)26Mg reaction have been presented at this
NPA-7 conference [6, 8, 7, 9]. The results of both experiments agree with each other, but are in
disagreement with the previous result of [4].

At the Aarhus accelerator forward kinematics was applied [6, 8]. The target composition of
the NaCl target was carefully monitored using Rutherford scattering on 23Na and natCl. Because
of the relatively low beam current, no signiﬁcant deterioration of the target was observed.
Angular distributions for the p0 and p1 protons were measured over a broad angular range.
Thus, the derived absolute cross sections of the 23Na(α,p)26Mg reaction should be reliable within
the given uncertainties in [8] which are of the order of 15 − 25 per cent.

At the ISAC facility at TRIUMF a helium-ﬁlled gas cell was mounted in the TUDA scattering
chamber for a measurement in inverse kinematics [7, 9]. The number of target nuclei was
controlled via the gas pressure, and the number of beam particles was measured by Rutherford
backscattering on the gas cell entrance window and an additionally mounted thin gold foil.
Also this procedure should lead to a reliable absolute normalization of these experimental data.
Absolute uncertainties of slightly below 20 % at higher energies and about 30 − 40 % at the
lowest energies are reported in [9].

reduced energy Ered for the 23Na(α,p)26Mg
reaction. The reduced cross sections σred
slightly increase towards lower target masses;
the expected range is indicated by three
calculations for 21Ne, 36Ar, and 51V (taken
from [1]; for details see there). The new data
[8, 9] ﬁt into the general systematics whereas
the earlier data [4] are much higher.

In both experiments the target can be considered as relatively thick (≈ 80 − 100 keV in the
Aarhus experiment and ≈ 140 keV in the TRIUMF experiment in the c.m. system). Thus, the
data show a relatively smooth energy dependence because of the averaging of the cross section
in a broad energy interval. The high data point of the Aarhus experiment at Elab ≈ 2.5 MeV
corresponds to a strong resonance which has been seen also in earlier experiments [12, 13]. The
new data are shown together with previous data for the 23Na(α,p)26Mg [4] and 23Na(α,n)26Al

reactions [14, 15] in Fig. 1 as cross sections vs. Elab and in Fig. 2 as σred vs. Ered. These ﬁgures
are updates of the corresponding Figs. 56 and 57 of the review [1].

It is obvious from Fig. 1 that the new data from Howard et al. [8] and Tomlinson et al. [9]
are in good agreement with each other and with the prediction from the statistical model (taken
from [1]). Contrary, the previous data by Almarez-Calderon et al. [4] are more than one order of
magnitude higher. Fig. 2 shows the same data as reduced cross sections σred vs. reduced energies
Ered. Here it has been found in [1] that there is a smooth trend for increased σred towards lower
target masses. The typical range of σred for the A ≈ 20 − 50 mass range is indicated by three
calculations for the total reaction cross sections of α + 21Ne, α + 36Ar, and α + 51V (full lines
from left to right in Fig. 2; for details see [1]). The new data of [8, 9] are located very close to
the expectation from systematics.

4. Summary and Conclusions
It has been shown in [1] that α-induced reaction cross sections for targets in the A ≈ 20 − 50
mass range show a relatively smooth and systematic behavior. This behavior can be nicely
visualized using so-called reduced cross sections σred and reduced energies Ered. The present
work provides a simple relation between the reduced energy Ered and the most eﬀective energy
E0 for astrophysical reaction rates (the so-called Gamow window).

Four exceptions from the general systematics of α-induced reaction cross sections have been
identiﬁed in [1]: 36Ar and 40Ar with smaller cross sections [3], 23Na [4] and 33S [5] with larger
cross sections. New data [8, 9] for 23Na which have been presented ﬁrst at this NPA-7 conference
[6, 7] supersede the previous data [4]. Contrary to the previous data by [4], these new data [8, 9]
indicate a regular behavior of 23Na. New data for the remaining outliers 36Ar, 40Ar (and 38Ar
where no data are available) and 33S would be helpful to conﬁrm or reject the irregular behavior
of these nuclei.
Note added: During review of this paper, an Erratum was published by Almarez-Calderon et al.
[16]. The Erratum states that the 23Na(α,p)26Mg data of [4] have to be scaled down by a factor
of 0.01, thus bringing these data into agreement with the later data in [8, 9].
