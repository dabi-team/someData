Abstract We evaluate validity of NLFFF extrapolation performed with Op-
timization class (OPTI) codes. While explaining inevitable for OPTI partial
non-solenoidality caused by the gas pressure notable role in pressure balance
at photospheric heights and by mathematical aspects related to optimization
and BVP (boundary value problem), we justify elimination of the non-solenoidal
component (postprocessing) from the OPTI result obtained. In essence, postpro-
cessing converts the entire non-solenoidal part into a solenoidal force part, which
possibly reﬂects factual deviation of magnetic ﬁeld from its force-free pproxima-
tion on the photosphere and in the solar corona. Two forms of postprocessing
have been analyzed in this paper. Postprocessing I eliminates the non-solenoidal
component without changing transverse ﬁeld at the measurement level, and
Postprocessing II leaves the ﬁeld normal component unchanged. Extrapolation,
postprocessing, and then comparison of metric and energy characteristics are
performed over AR 11158 active region for a small fragment of its evolution
containing the February X-class ﬂare. Our version of OPTI code showed that
free energy decreased by ∼ 1032 erg within 1 hour, which corresponds to theo-
retical estimations of the ﬂare-caused magnetic energy loss. This result diﬀers
signiﬁcantly from the one in Sun et al. (2012). Therefore, we also comment on
some features of our OPTI code implementation, which may cause signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between our results and those obtained using the Wiegelmann (2004)
version of OPTI code in study by Sun et al. (2012).

1. Introduction

As it is commonly believed, extreme solar activity is provided by magnetic
energy of active regions (Forbes, 2000). According to Thomson’s (or Dirichlet’s)
theorem, e.g., Lawrence (1998), any solenoidal ﬁeld can be decomposed into
the current and potential parts. The energy of the latter corresponds to the
minimum possible under equal conditions for the normal component at the region
boundary. For this reason, only energy of the current component (free energy)
is responsible for the magnetic region ability to release energy, and can be used
for predicting solar ﬂares Barnes et al. (2016).

Obtaining magnetic structures and their energy characteristics from measure-
ment data accessible at photospheric heights is only possible if approximation of
the force-free ﬁeld is used. This approximation is applicable for the upper corona
due to low β the ratio of gas-kinetic pressure (exponentially falling with height)
to magnetic pressure (falling slower). At photospheric heights, parameter β can
be conventionally considered low only in regions with rather high ﬁeld module
|B|. In regions with lower |B|, parameter β can take values of order of 1 and
greater. Because it is a strong ﬁeld that generates the main structure of the
coronal magnetic ﬁeld, we can notionally use the force-free approximation. The
key point for our work will exactly be the fact that getting a ﬁeld model of
a real active region from the force-free approximation, we will inevitably face
disagreement with the real magnetic ﬁeld containing a certain force component.
In particular, free energy of the force-free approximation will also diﬀer from
free energy of a real solenoidal ﬁeld with the force component.

In practical extrapolation, many methods are developed from the force-free
approximation and applied (see, e.g. (Schrijver et al., 2006; Metcalf et al., 2008)).
In this paper we examine the code based on the optimization method (OPTI),
Wheatland, Sturrock, and Roumeliotis (2000), one of the most used in magnetog-
raphy applications of active regions. The expertise is of fundamental importance
in the context of signiﬁcant non-solenoidality of numerical OPTI results dis-
cussed in literature (Valori et al., 2013; Mastrano, Wheatland, and Gilchrist,
2018). Notable non-solenoidality of OPTI results is quite natural and is as-
sociated with two factors. First, the OPTI algorithm implements the search
for solution in the functional space of arbitrary non-solenoidal ﬁelds, on equal
terms minimizing both Lorenz’s power and divergence. If we solve a problem
with boundary values (BVs) providing a force-free result, the OPTI algorithm
(as known from the Low and Lou (1990) analytic force-free models) provides a
smallness of the non-solenoidal component at the level of numerical errors. In
case there is no force-free solution satisfying the BVP, it is natural to expect that
the algorithm will lead to occurrence of the ﬁnite Lorenz force and divergence
in the solution. Secondly, the BVP speciﬁcity for OPTI (a full set of the ﬁeld
boundary components Bx, By, Bz is speciﬁed) concedes the absence of any force-
free solution. In fact, we can cite the following example. If it is a force ﬁeld,
then quite natural are cases when the normal ﬁeld on the solar surface is zero
with the nonzero component of the current normal component. In this case, if
we try to deﬁne boundary conditions for a force-free ﬁeld using these data, we
come to a non-realistic inﬁnite value of the force-free parameter α. That is, for

SOLA: paper_free_energy_bbl.tex; 17 January 2020; 1:37; p. 2

Validity of NLFFF Optimization Reconstruction

this case, it is notionally impossible to ﬁnd a suitable force-free ﬁeld, and we
have the right to extend this statement to any real photospheric ﬁeld. Thus, in
OPTI solutions, we will always have the force and non-solenoidal components
consistent with the results by (Valori et al., 2013; Mastrano, Wheatland, and
Gilchrist, 2018). Desirable estimates of non-solenoidality for other extrapolation
techniques considered in Mastrano, Wheatland, and Gilchrist (2018), apparently,
can also be explained in terms of their features and speciﬁcs of their BVP. For
example, methods that belong to GradRubin CFIT, XTRAPOL and FEMQ
class from Mastrano, Wheatland, and Gilchrist (2018) are realized (exactly or
almost exactly) in the class of solenoidal ﬁelds and this is ﬁrst. Second, their
BVP is deﬁned by the pair Bn and α(Bn > 0). These two moments naturally
lead to force-free solutions, as shown in Mastrano, Wheatland, and Gilchrist
(2018). So, we have two basic diﬀerences in two approaches to magnetic ﬁeld
extrapolation. When trying to save accurate BVs of all ﬁeld components, the
OPTI technique leads to an approximate result with the force and non-solenoidal
components. In the second approach, we get some force-free and solenoidal result,
while giving away accurate reproduction of the boundary ﬁeld that we obtained
in measurements. Since the ﬁeld on the photosphere is diﬀerent from the force-
free ﬁeld, the force-free parameter α, strictly speaking, does not make sense in
its exact meaning, i.e. we to some extent select boundary values of the ﬁeld. In
this situation, no one can say results of which of the two approaches are more
realistic. It is likely that in an eﬀort to obtain an accurate force-free ﬁeld, we can
move further away from the real ﬁeld, which has a noticeable force component.
In order to clarify the OPTI problem highlighted in studies by (Valori et al.,
2013; Mastrano, Wheatland, and Gilchrist, 2018), we implement one of the
two types of postprocessing. Both types of postprocessing completely remove
non-solenoidality from our solution, and convert it into an additional force com-
ponent. Postprocessing I leaves the transverse ﬁeld unchanged at the bottom
boundary of the extrapolation box using the divergence cleaner algorithm by
Valori et al. (2013), Formula (B.4). On the contrary, Postprocessing II leaves
the normal ﬁeld unchanged by adding a compensating potential component to
the ﬁeld of Postprocessing I. After any postprocessing, ﬁnal solution includes
a certain non-zero force component. This force component, if not taken as a
mistake, is likely to indicate the above-mentioned deviation of the real solar
magnetic ﬁeld from the force-free ﬁeld.

Our research is conducted on a well-studied part of AR 11158 evolution that
contains the X-class ﬂare on February 15, 2011 01:44 UT. Extrapolation is carried
out with our own version of OPTI technical implementation. We compare the
AR 11158 energy characteristics within the selected time interval and the overall
structure of ﬁeld lines with the results of Sun et al. (2012). It is important that
our results before and after any postprocessing show approximately the same
∼ 1032 erg drop in free energy during one hour after the ﬂare onset. This matches
the estimates of the required reserve energy for X-class events (Hudson, 1991;
Bleybel et al., 2002). Such a great discrepancy with the result by Sun et al.
(2012) seems to be caused by the fundamental diﬀerence in some aspects of our
OPTI implementation that we point out here.

For results before and after one of the two postprocessings, we perform a

detailed analysis of the extrapolation metric parameters.

2. Determining extrapolation box and constructing boundary

conditions

For the entire series of calculations we use the same rectangular 3D box [214.56×
213.12 × 183.6]Mm. The center of its bottom face corresponds to approximate
center of AR 11158 at −20.85o latitude and 34.9o longitude. The X axis of the
bottom face is directed towards the North Pole. Coordinates x, y correspond to
the Lambert equal area projection (Calabretta and Greisen, 2002; Thompson,
2006). The initial z -coordinate corresponds to the solar radius. For calculation,
grid (299 × 297 × 256)is used, with a relevant pixel size of 720 km. For extrapo-
lation, we use SDO/HMI (hmi.B 720s) vector magnetograms without azimuthal
ambiguity. We remap data of the ﬁeld of view magnetograms (Bx, By, Bz) to
the box coordinate system on the bottom boundary of the box. Thus, we will
consider BVs for the extrapolation problem at the bottom boundary as given. To
specify BVs at the other boundaries of the box, we use a potential solenoidal ﬁeld,
whose normal component coincides at the bottom boundary with the magnetic
ﬁeld normal component deﬁned above. We calculate the potential ﬁeld with the
Fourier decomposition algorithm similar to (Alissandrakis, 1981) using FFT. At
the same time, in order avoid the zero harmonic problem in case the initial data
give non-zero total ﬂow of the normal ﬁeld, we specify the normal component on
the extended region that contains 4 initial quadrants of the bottom boundary
of our box. In the ﬁrst lower quadrant we set boundary values of our box. In
the diagonal one the same boundary values. In the rest quadrants there are
boundary values of opposite sign. Next, we calculate the potential ﬁeld in 3D
box only above the ﬁrst quadrant. Thus, we ensure that the calculated nor-
mal component coincides with the one speciﬁed at the bottom boundary. The
potential ﬁeld calculated in this way will be referred to as the ﬁeld of BV PpotI
Using the BV PpotI ﬁeld, we deﬁne boundary values for (Bx, By, Bz) at the
other boundaries of the box. We use the same potential ﬁeld to deﬁne the start-
ing ﬁeld in 3D box for OPTI extrapolation exactly according to the algorithm
described in Wheatland, Sturrock, and Roumeliotis (2000) without using the
weight function. To calculate the OPTI ﬁeld free energy (before postprocess-
ing), further we also use this potential ﬁeld. We calculate energies of OPTI
and BV PpotI ﬁelds in the root box [169.26 × 167.766 × 159.12] Mm with grid
(235 × 233 × 221).

To arrange Postprocessing II and to calculate free energies of Postprocessing I
and Postprocessing II ﬁelds, we need a potential ﬁeld corresponding to the given
normal ﬁeld on all faces of the box (BV PpotII ). To obtain this potential ﬁeld,
we use the code described in Rudenko and Anﬁnogentov (2017).

Further, for convenience, we will use the following abbreviations:

• Ball - full boundary of the box.
• Bb -bottom boundary of the box.
• Bst - boundary including side and upper boundaries of the box.
• BVall - boundary values Bx, By, Bz at Ball.
• BVb - boundary values Bx, By, Bz at Bb.
• BVst - boundary values Bx, By, Bz at Bst.

SOLA: paper_free_energy_bbl.tex; 17 January 2020; 1:37; p. 4

Validity of NLFFF Optimization Reconstruction

• BV nall - boundary values Bn at Ball.
• BV nb - boundary values Bn at Bb.
• BV nst - boundary values Bn at Bst.
• BV tall - boundary values of ﬁeld components (Bt) at Ball.
• BV tb - boundary values Bt at Bb.
• BV tst - boundary values Bt at Bst.

Therefore, the OPTI extrapolation problem is formulated as NLFF extrapolation
with BV POP T I : when BVb from vector magnetograms data and
Bst=Bst(BV PpotI ).

3. Features of OPTI extrapolation code

The code we use for OPTI extrapolation corresponds exactly to the Wheatland,
Sturrock, and Roumeliotis (2000) algorithm without using the weight function
with the ﬁxed shift of time parameter of the optimization process dt = 0.05∆2,
where ∆ is the pixel size of grid.The number of optimization process steps
is always constant and amounts 400000. It is with this number of steps that
the required quality of extrapolation results is achieved. The algorithm is built
on parallelized calculations. Calculation of one problem was performed using
a supercomputer with 36 processors. One extrapolation for a box with the
characteristics described above is performed within ∼ 20 h.

Since our extrapolation (R1) results can be compared with those (R2) by
Sun et al. (2012)), due to their signiﬁcant diﬀerences, we will list common and
diﬀerent elements of R1 and R2:

•
•

for R1 and R2, extrapolation boxes and grids are almost the same.
in R1 and R2, the potential ﬁeld is calculated in diﬀerent manner (their
energies are close to each other).

• preprocessing is not used in R1, but it is used in R2 (not to change mea-

•

surement data is our principled position).
in R1, weight function is not used in the Wheatland, Sturrock, and Roume-
liotis (2000) minimizing functional, in R2 it is used.

• R1 uses a ﬁxed dt step and a ﬁxed number of steps, R2 uses automatic
adjustment of dt step and the end of the optimization process based on cri-
terion of convergence of the functional L metric from Wheatland, Sturrock,
and Roumeliotis (2000) . In the second case, apparently, the optimization
ends too soon, bumping into the local minimum of L in the functional space.
In the ﬁrst case, the optimization process occurs with regular reduction of
L, without the requirement of reducing it at each step. Most likely, this last
point leads to a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in OPTI extrapolation.

4. Postprocessing

Suppose we have a non-solenoidal OPTI magnetic ﬁeld B complying with
BV POP T I . Since the ﬁeld ﬂow is zeroth, the following equations are valid at
Ball:

For this BV POP T I ﬁeld, we will consider two ways of cleaning the divergence.

4.1. Postprocessing I

According to Formula (B.4) from Valori et al. (2013), from B we can distinguish
the following solenoidal BsI component:

BsI = B + (cid:98)z ×

(cid:90) z2

z

(∇ · B)dz(cid:48),

(2)

where z2 is coordinate z of the box upper boundary. This equation (2) does not
change components Bx, By throughout the box. If ﬁeld B were strictly solenoidal,
the error in Bz would have the order of magnitude Bz at the top boundary of the
box, i.e. it would be negligible (in numerical implementation of Equation (2)).
Non-solenoidality of B leads to a signiﬁcant change in Bz(z = z0), therefore, the
reference potential ﬁeld (BV PpotII ) for BsI should change signiﬁcantly.

4.2. Postprocessing II

Postprocessing II is to ﬁnd the solenoidal ﬁeld of BsII in the form

BsII = BsI + ∇ψ(cid:48),

where the solenoidal potential ﬁeld ∇ψ(cid:48) provides equality

(BsII )z = Bz

f or

z = z0,

(3)

(4)

i.e. ∇ψ(cid:48) provides equal BVb of ﬁelds B and BsII compensating for BVb changes in
the BsI ﬁeld. We ﬁnd ﬁeld ∇ψ(cid:48) by solving the problem of BV PpotI numerically.
Thus, in Postprocessing II, situation is opposite at the bottom boundary of the
box, the transverse ﬁeld changes signiﬁcantly while the box normal component
remains unchanged. Changes in BVst are usually negligible for a compact mag-
netic region far enough from the boundaries. In addition, we don’t in urgent
need of preserving BVst that have rather artiﬁcial nature of origin. In practice,
energies of potential reference ﬁelds of B and BsII are very close to each other.
We should note a very important point of the presence of the common feature
for procedures of Postprocessing I and II, to which we will return again a little
later both procedures accurately retain the observed z component of current J
on Vb.

5. Analysis of OPTI results and their modiﬁcations

5.1. Conﬁguration of ﬁeld lines

For the same time point, for which the overall mapping of the ﬁeld lines con-
ﬁguration for AR 11158 was given in Sun et al. (2012), we give a similar rep-

resentation of ﬁeld lines in Figures 1-3.We see that our line images are well
correlated with those in Sun et al. (2012) and result in approximately the same
compliance with the real structure of ﬁeld lines highlighted on the AIA image.
It is quite diﬃcult to prefer one of our results or the result by Sun et al.
(2012). Note that without postprocessing, OPTI ﬁeld results in many broken
non-real ﬁeld lines (mostly coming from the weak ﬁeld regions). However, we
see that the basic structure is shown quite well. Procedures of Postprocessing I
and II yield smoother ﬁelds. The expected lines are easier to ﬁnd. From value
judgment, Postprocessing II results in a slightly smoother ﬁeld in relation to
ﬁeld of Postprocessing I.

The metrics of Equations (11) and (12) are similar to those introduced by
Wheatland, Sturrock, and Roumeliotis (2000). The former reﬂects deviation of
B from the force-free approximation, the latter solenoidality.

For the time investigated, metrics of Equations (5)-(12) are presented in

Tables (1) and (2). We see that OPTI+Postprocessing I reduces, and
OPTI+Postprocessing II, on the contrary, increases the energy relative to OPTI
by approximately the same values of 1032erg. OPTI+Postprocessing II practi-
cally does not change the potential ﬁeld energy, while it decreases signiﬁcantly
in OPTI+Postprocessing I. Free energies after both types of postprocessing
are equally (signiﬁcantly) increased by the same order of magnitude 1032erg,
2 × 1032erg greater than the
while the OPTI+Postprocessing II energy is
OPTI+Postprocessing I energy.

The OPTI result gives a relatively small ε1, i.e. formally we can consider this
solution close to the solenoidal one. If this value were not small, notionally no
compliance of OPTI extrapolation with the real ﬁeld could be expected. At the
same time, as we see from ε2, we cannot estimate the real free energy with fair ac-
curacy. Note that ε2 is consistent with the result obtained for OPTI in Mastrano,
Wheatland, and Gilchrist (2018). Values of ε1 and ε2 for OPTI+Postprocessing
I, II show that we succeed in getting rid of non-solenoidality. Besides, values of

Figure 4. Altitude dependence of θj : red - OPTI, green - OPTI+Postprocessing I, blue

ε2 are well consistent with similar ones (Mastrano, Wheatland, and Gilchrist,
2018) for NLFFF extrapolation methods operating with the class of solenoidal
ﬁelds. From f metric (Table 2), we can also see the result of eliminating the
non-solenoidality to the level of numerical errors, we hope. After elimination
of non-solenoidality we naturally obtain a certain increase in θj metric after
postprocessing, indicating deviation of the solution from the force-free approxi-
mation. We cannot estimate, to which extent this value reﬂects the error or eﬀect
of the real deviation of the ﬁeld from the force-free ﬁeld. Applying Equation 11
to each z layer and displaying θj in Figure 4 , we provide better representation of
the force-free characteristic of our results. We see that, starting at the same level,
all three characteristics decrease with height. Postprocessing II shows the highest
value. Starting from the height of ∼ 110 Mm, all three characteristics merge and
grow to a large value typical of the potential ﬁeld. The OPTI algorithm may not
signiﬁcantly change the initial potential ﬁeld at these altitudes. In any case, the
ﬁeld at these altitudes is quite small and does not essentially contribute to the
energy we are interested in.

6. Evolution of AR 11158 energy in OPTI results

Consider the results of the NLFF extrapolation of AR 11158 in the time interval
with the X-class ﬂare that began at 2011/02/15 01:44UT. Figure 5 describes
the time behavior of energies of all three of our extrapolations (solid lines) and
energies corresponding to the reference potential ﬁelds (dashed lines). These
dependencies reﬂect the X-ﬂare event well, but they have signiﬁcant shifts along
the energy axis, same as in the case discussed in the previous section. The lowest
energies result from OPTI+Postprocessing I, then OPTI and the highest belongs
to OPTI+Postprocessing II. Energies of the reference potential ﬁelds of OPTI
and OPTI+Postprocessing II, as expected, are very close to each other. Energies
of the OPTI+Postprocessing I reference potential ﬁeld is lower by 2.5 × 1032 erg.
For OPTI, energies of ﬁelds and reference potential ﬁeld were calculated (as it
is normally done) in the root domain of the box, using BV PpotI for the OPTI

reference potential ﬁeld. For all other cases, energies were calculated for the
entire box using BV PpotII for the reference potential ﬁelds In general, we can
say that energies calculated for the entire box or its root domain always have
little diﬀerence between each other, which can be clearly seen from graphs for
the OPTI and OPTI+Postprocessing II reference potential ﬁelds. They almost
coincide with each other despite diﬀerence of their BV nst.

Figures 6 and 7 describe the time behavior of free energies. Note that all three
current components of our solutions with zero BV nall diﬀer from each other
by only some potential (for OPTI non-solenoidal) ﬁelds. Therefore, due to the
solenoidality of OPTI+Postprocessings I, II, their free energies must coincide
with each other. That’s what we can observe in Figures 6 and 7. Inﬂuence
of non-solenoidality in OPTI leads to a general decrease in free energy with-
out fundamental changes in general nature of its behavior. As can be seen
from Figures 6 and 7, all three dependencies of free energy give the order of
its dropping −∆Ef ree 1032 erg during one hour after the X-ﬂare onset. This
corresponds to the estimate of released energy in X-class events (Hudson, 1991;
Bleybel et al., 2002). To explain signiﬁcant diﬀerence between this result and

that in Sun et al. (2012), we compare the height dependence of the mean free
energy density in Figure 8 with the same dependence for the same point in time
shown in Figure 4 from Sun et al. (2012). While heights and the value maxima
coincide, our mean free energy density has a much larger scale of descent. In Sun
et al. (2012), this value shows the ﬁeld proximity to the potential ﬁeld starting
already at 20M m heights. We have the same situation developing much higher
at ∼ 100Mm altitudes (which is also consistent with the behavior of the θj force-
free parameter in Figure 4). This diﬀerence in behavior of the mean free energy
density seems to be related, as mentioned in Section 3, to the earlier termination
of the optimization process in Sun et al. (2012). In our case, we go further, thus
calculating free energy more accurately.

Another important diﬀerence from Sun et al. (2012) is manifested in negative
values we obtain (for the entire time interval in question) of the mean free energy

density at zero height ( Figure 8)). This result is interesting from the physical
point of view. As it was shown in Livshits et al. (2015) ), for any force-free ﬁeld
above the sphere the following consequence of the virial theorem is true on the
sphere (r = R)), a ﬁeld is more radial in relation to the reference potential ﬁeld:

From Equation 13, considering equality of the normal components (B)n and
(Bpot)n it automatically follows:

(r = R).

(14)

Since the mean free energy density is proportional to the integral of Equation 14
, it should also be strictly negative for the force-free ﬁeld above the sphere. In
the case of rectangular box geometry, the statement above, strictly speaking, is
not necessarily valid. However, the real bottom boundary of our box corresponds
to the sphere, magnetic regions are mostly compact, and generally strong ﬁelds
should be force-free on the photosphere. Hence, negativity of the mean free
energy density at zero altitude is likely to manifest itself. That’s what we have.
Interestingly, the Low and Lou (1990) model has the same result for rectangular
box geometry [61 × 61 × 31], [36 × 36 × 1.5]Mm, with parameters l = 0.5, ϕ = 1.4,
core ([46, 46, 27],[2.256 × 2.256 × 1.3]Mm) and max(Bz) = 800Gs (see Figure 9).
In Figure 9, we see that this property of mean free energy density to take negative
values near zero altitude is equally manifested not only in the numerical OPTI
result, but also in the analytical ﬁeld model.

7. Conclusion

Evaluation of the OPTI extrapolation validity has shown signiﬁcant inﬂuence
of partial non-solenoidality on the free energy OPTI results. This eﬀect is dis-
played in a signiﬁcant shift in the free energy, but does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect
its time behavior character. Both with and without divergence cleaning, the
OPTI extrapolation gives the same reasonable estimates of changes in the active
region energy during powerful eruptive X-class events. The divergence cleaning
of OPTI results, regardless of the implementation method, leads to the same
values of free energy, only the energy levels being changed. Thus, we can trust
behavior of changes in free energy, both with and without divergence cleaning.
Converting the non-solenoidal part into the force component, divergence cleaning
is beneﬁcial to the obtained results. It signiﬁcantly reduces the number of non-
realistic entangled magnetic lines, without essential changes in the ﬁeld structure.
Divergence cleaning (Postprocessings II), which preserves the photospheric ﬁeld
normal component, does not change the reference potential ﬁeld energy. Di-
vergence cleaning (Postprocessings I), which preserves the photospheric ﬁeld
transverse components, reduces signiﬁcantly the energy of its reference potential
ﬁeld. In terms of undesirability of changes in the photospheric ﬁeld normal
component and obtaining high energies of the potential ﬁeld and energies of
the calculated ﬁeld, Postprocessing II looks more preferable. In our opinion,
the main advantage of the OPTI approach to NLFF extrapolation (both with
and without divergence cleaning) is preserving the unchanged photospheric (J)z
current component, which, in fact, allows to obtain adequate estimate of the real
energy release of the active region. From this point of view, a signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence can be expected between the reality and results of NLFF extrapolations
allowing modiﬁcation of the (J)z component. This, for example, takes place in
the approach based on the algorithms of Grad Rubin class. For the same reason,
preprocessing (the procedure removes most of the net force and torque from the
data, Wiegelmann, Inhester, and Sakurai (2006)) often used in practice (among
all, to OPTI extrapolation) is undesirable, because it inevitably leads to local
changes in (J)z.
