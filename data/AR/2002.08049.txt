THE UNIQUENESS OF COVERS OF WIDELY GENERALIZED
LINE GRAPHS

MICHITAKA FURUYA, SHO KUBOTA, TETSUJI TANIGUCHI, AND KIYOTO YOSHINO

Abstract. As a natural generalization of line graphs, Hoﬀman line graphs were
deﬁned by Woo and Neumaier. Especially, Hoﬀman line graphs are closely related
to the smallest eigenvalue of graphs, and the uniqueness of strict covers of a Hoﬀman
line graph plays a key role in such a study. In this paper, we prove a theorem for
the uniqueness of strict covers under a condition which can be checked in ﬁnite
time. Our result gives a generalization and a short proof for the main part of [Ars
Math. Contemp. 1 (2008) 81–98].

Throughout this paper, we consider only ﬁnite undirected graphs without loops or

For a graph G, the line graph L(G) of G is the graph obtained by V (L(G)) = E(G)
and E(L(G)) =
e′
. Line graphs have an important
∩
structure representing claw-free graphs (see [2]), and many researchers have studied
properties on line graphs. For example, Thomassen [6] conjectured that every 4-
connected line graph is Hamiltonian. To attack Thomassen’s conjecture or related
topics, we frequently focus on a graph GL such that L(GL) is isomorphic to the
target line graph L (where such a graph GL is called a preimage of L), and discuss
the existence of a closed trail with a good property in GL instead of the existence
of a Hamiltonian cycle in L. Thus it is important to analyze the structure of a
preimage of a line graph. However, in general, there exist line graphs having two
distinct preimages; for example, the triangle and the claw are distinct preimages of
the triangle. Furthermore, when we consider the diﬀerence for the correspondence
of the vertices of a line graph to the edges of a preimage, we can construct another
example of order 6 (cf. Figure 4 in Section 2). On the other hand, it is known that a
preimage of a line graph of order at least 7 is uniquely determined even if we consider
above diﬀerence (cf. Corollary 1.2).

A concept of Hoﬀman graphs appeared implicitly in [4] and was strictly deﬁned by
Woo and Neumaier [7] as a natural generalization of line graphs, and such graphs are
especially used in algebraic graph theory. Since the deﬁnition of a Hoﬀman line graph
is slightly complicated, we postpone giving its strict deﬁnition and related notations

to know strict signiﬁcance of our result are advised to previously read Section 2.)
We describe typical Hoﬀman graphs in Figure 1, where their names derive from a
traditional custom. It is a worthy fact that Hoﬀman graphs have “slim” vertices and
“fat” vertices. For a family H of Hoﬀman graphs, Woo and Neumaier [7] deﬁned a

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we deﬁne the concept of Hoﬀman
graphs and related topics. In Section 3, we give some lemmas which are used in the
argument for Hoﬀman graphs. Many lemmas in Subsection 3.1 have been used in
some existing research as folklore. However, to keep the paper self-contained, we give
their proof (and so the proof of some lemmas in Subsection 3.1 does not aﬀect to the
shortness of our proof). Hence readers familiar with Hoﬀman graphs are advised to
skip the proof. We give more essential lemmas for our proof in Subsections 3.2 and 3.3.
We prove Theorem 1.4 in Section 4. In Section 5, we prove further propositions used
in computer search, and we also demonstrate computer search to ﬁnd the existence
of N in Theorem 1.4 for a family of H other than

(see Example 5.8).

In this section, we deﬁne Hoﬀman graphs and related concepts.

2. Hoffman graph

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Hoﬀman graph). A Hoﬀman graph h is a pair (H, µ) of a graph
H and a labeling map µ : V (H)
, where V (H) denotes the vertex set of H,
satisfying the following conditions:

→ {

f, s

}

1) Every vertex with label f is adjacent to at least one vertex with label s; and
2) the vertices with label f are pairwise non-adjacent.

∈

N f

∪
h (x) (resp. N f
h (x)

Several symbols deﬁned below are analogous to ones used in graph theory. Let
h = (H, µ) be a Hoﬀman graph. The vertices of H are regarded as the vertices of h.
A vertex of H with label s (resp. label f ) is called a slim vertex (resp. a fat vertex).
We let Vs(h) (resp. Vf (h)) denote the set of slim vertices (resp. fat vertices) of H, and
Vf (h). We let E(h) denote the set of edges of H. For a vertex
let V (h) = Vs(h)
x of h, we let N s
h (x)) denote the set of neighbors labeled s (resp. f )
of x, and set Nh(x) = N s
y
h (x). For two vertices x and y, we write x
Nh(y). A Hoﬀman graph h = (H, µ) is called a slim graph if h has no fat
if x
vertices, i.e., µ(x) = s for every vertex x of h. We regard an ordinary graph with no
labeling as a slim graph. A Hoﬀman graph is said to be fat if every slim vertex is
adjacent to a fat vertex. A Hoﬀman graph h′ = (H ′, µ′) is called an induced (Hoﬀman)
subgraph of h if H ′ is an induced subgraph of H and µ
|V (H ′) = µ′. The rest of this

paper, “(Hoﬀman) subgraph” means “induced (Hoﬀman) subgraph”. For X

Note that a Hoﬀman graph h can be regarded as the sum of h and the empty Hoﬀman
graph. If h is the sum of two non-empty Hoﬀman graphs, then it is said to be de-
composable; otherwise, it is said to be indecomposable. Note that the sum of Hoﬀman
graphs satisﬁes commutative and associative law. Thus the sum of more than two
Hoﬀman graphs is naturally deﬁned, and the sum of only one Hoﬀman graph should
be itself. An example of a decomposable Hoﬀman graph are depicted in Figure 2.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that (1) implies (2). Suppose that the condition (1) holds, i.e.,
G has a unique strict ¯H-cover h. Let m be a non-negative integer such that G is a slim
H(m)-line graph. Then by applying Lemma 3.8 with H = H(m) and h, G has a strict
H(m)-cover g. This together with Lemma 3.16 implies that g is a strict H(m)-cover
of G, and hence g is also a strict ¯H-cover of G. By the uniqueness of h for strict
¯H-covers of G, it follows that h and g are equivalent, which leads to (2).

Next we show that (2) implies (1). Suppose that the condition (2) holds. Since G

is a ﬁnite slim H-line graph, there exists a suﬃciently large integer M such that

(a) G is a slim H(M)-line graph, and

(b) every strict ¯H-cover of G is a strict H(M)-cover.

By (2), G has a unique strict H(M)-cover h up to equivalence, and hence h is also
a strict ¯H-cover of G. By the uniqueness of h for strict H(M)-covers of G, it follows
from (b) that h is a unique strict ¯H-cover of G, which leads to (1).

Recall that the following is our main result in this paper.

Theorem 1.4 Let H

Considering Lemma 3.17, it suﬃces to show that the following holds:

We prove (4.1) by induction on m + n. If n = N, then the assumption of the theorem
