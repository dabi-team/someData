The electrical transport properties of anodically grown TiO2 nanotubes was investigated. Amor-
phous nanotubes were anodically grown on titanium foil and transformed through annealing into
the anatase phase. Amorphous and polycrystalline single nanotubes were isolated and contacted for
measurements of the electrical resistance. Non-linear current-voltage characteristics were explained
using the ﬂuctuation induced tunneling conduction model. A clear enhancement of the conductance
was induced in an insulating anatase nanotube through low-energy Ar/H ion irradiation. Confocal
Raman spectroscopy shows that the annealed samples were in anatase phase and a blueshift due to
phonon conﬁnement was observed.

INTRODUCTION

Titanium dioxide nanotube arrays, formed by self-
organizing anodization, have attracted considerable at-
tention. These 1D structures are used in wide range of
applications such as electrodes in catalysis1, photocataly-
sis2, dye-synthesized solar cells3, gas sensors4, photoelec-
trochemical water splitting5,6, in batteries7 or for CO2
reduction8,9. Biocompatible Ti46Si12O42 nanostructured
surfaces can be used to enhance cell attachment and pro-
liferation10. This outstanding ﬂexibility is a consequence
of diﬀerent electronic, chemical and ionic properties of
anatase, brookite and rutile11,12. Anatase is often more
interesting for applications, such as solar cells, due to the
larger electron mobility compared to rutile.13 The com-
bination with the large active surface area of nanostruc-
tures, results in a variety of dielectric, conducting, mag-
netic, catalytic and other physical and chemical proper-
ties. Doping can be used to enhance the photo catalytic
activity of TiO2 nanotubes, e.g. with W14–16, Au/W17,
Co18,19, or Co15.

The general mechanism of electron transport, partic-
ularly in nanostructures of TiO2 , is not well studied
and understood. Most of the published work focuses
on macroscopic samples such as nanotubular arrays20,21,
where parasite eﬀects such as contact contributions in
two-point (2P) measurements or the scattering of light
inside the tangle of tubes, can have considerable in-
ﬂuence on the measurements. Depending on the con-
tacts, non-metallic clusters (Au), Schottky barriers (Pt)
or oxide layers (Al, Cr) could be formed11. The mag-
netic22,23 and electrical transport properties of TiO2 de-
pend strongly on structural defects (single crystal band
3.2 eV24,25), such as oxygen or titanium va-
gap: 3.0
cancies. The transport properties can also be strongly

−

inﬂuenced by the scattering on the sample surface, as
was found for polycrystalline macroscopic arrays of TiO2
nanotubes26. In addition, it was shown that, intragrain
and intergrain conduction processes play an important
role in disordered nanowires and nanotubes27,28. There-
fore, a large number of diﬀerent resistivities have been re-
ported, e.g. 104 Ωcm (2P, top/bottom tube contacts)29,
102 . . . 103 Ωcm30 and 1 Ωcm31 using a four-point (4P)
probes method. For comparison, the obtained resistivity
of diﬀerent polycrystalline bulk anatase covers a large
range: 102 . . . 107 Ωcm13,32,33.

Recently, ﬂuctuation induced tunneling conductance
(FITC)34 has been proposed as a responsible mechanism
in ZnO nanowires27,
in bundles of double-walled car-
bon nanotubes35 and in nanoporous TiO2 thin ﬁlms36.
The FITC model predicts non-linear current-voltage I
−
V curves due to intrinsic barriers between grains in
the sample34. Other frequently used mechanisms in-
clude variable-range hopping and thermally activated
processes. However, they cannot explain the non-linear
V curves27 and the saturation of the re-
behavior of I
sistivity at low temperature37,38.

−

In this work, procedures to isolate single TiO2 nan-
otubes and to establish barrier free contacts for electrical
transport measurements are presented. The resistance of
amorphous and polycrystalline anatase samples were in-
vestigated in a broad temperature range. A FITC mech-
anism contributes to the conductivity in all measured
V curves. Additionally, the
samples with non-linear I
−
electrical transport of a highly insulating anatase nan-
otube was modiﬁed by means of defect production at the
surface using low-energy ion irradiation.

tures results in mixed phases of anatase and rutile, even-
tually, the single nanotubes would collapse40. Therefore,
only pure amorphous and anatase nanotubes were inves-
tigated.

×

Bundles of nanotubes were scratched oﬀ the foil onto
commercial, p-boron doped silicon substrates (5
5 mm)
with a 150 nm SiNx coating, see FIG. 1(b). By apply-
ing pressure and a slow circular motion using a second
substrate, some single nanotubes break oﬀ the bundles
and were stuck to the substrates because of electrostatic
attraction. Suitable tubes were selected using an opti-
cal microscope.
In order to ﬁx the nanotubes on the
substrate and to prepare them for contacting, electron
beam induced deposition (EBID) of tungsten carbide was
used, see FIG. 1(c). The deposited WCx is nearly in-
sulating42 and provides the necessary steps to compen-
sate the height diﬀerence between contacts and nanotube.
The substrates were covered with a positive working re-
sist (ALL-RESIST, PMMA 950 K, AP-R 671-05) and,
by means of electron beam lithography (EBL), the struc-
tures of the contacts were printed into the resist. After
developing, a bilayer ﬁlm composed of Cr (5 nm) and
Au (35 nm) was sputtered. The PMMA was later re-
moved by acetone. The width of the contacts exceeds
the WCx steps, in order to get a potential barrier-free
electrical connection. A prepared nanotube can be seen
in FIG. 1(d). An overview of the structural properties
and dimensions of the nanotubes can be seen in Table I.
For the transport measurements, each sample was con-
tacted on a chip carrier placed on the cold head of a stan-
dard closed cycle cooling system inside a vacuum bell
with a minimum temperature of T
30 K. The electri-
cal resistance was measured using the four-point probe
conﬁguration with a current source (Keithley 6221) and
a nano- voltmeter (Keithley 2182). The high resistance
measurements were performed with a constant applied
voltage using a DC source (Yokogawa 7651). The current
was monitored with a shunt resistance of Rs = 9.101 MΩ
in series with the samples. For low temperature mea-
surements down to T = 5 K, a commercial 4He cryostat
(Oxford Instruments) was used.

≈

The Ar ion irradiation was done in a self-made plasma
chamber with a parallel plate (copper) setup at room
temperature. The chamber was evacuated to a pressure
of P
0.1 mbar with an Ar/H gas mixture (Ar: 90 % and
H: 10 %, Air Liquide) ﬂowing through the chamber. The
12 cm away
chip carriers with samples were mounted

II. EXPERIMENTAL

The TiO2 nanotubes have been separated from nan-
otubular layers anodically grown on titanium foil (Advent
Research Materials Ltd., 99.6 % purity) in an electro-
chemical cell with ethylene glycol electrolyte containing
0.15 M ammonium ﬂuoride and 1 M H2O. The titanium
foil was anodized with a potential of 60 V applied for
5 hours. Finally, the nanotubular array was placed in
ethanol and dried with nitrogen gas. The grown nan-
otubes (see FIG. 1(a)) are initially in the amorphous
phase and were annealed in air using a Rapid Ther-
mal Annealer (Jet-ﬁrst Rapid Thermal Annealer, Jip-
ilec, France) in order to obtain polycrystalline anatase
samples. The heating/cooling rate was 15◦C/min with
annealing temperatures of 350◦C and 450◦C. After an-
nealing, the nanotubes were polycrystalline and exhib-
ited anatase morphology, for more detailed information
please refer to Refs.39–41. Annealing at higher tempera-

from the plasma center and a bias voltage of Ubias = 50 V
was used to accelerate the ions towards the sample, while
connected to ground, and the bias current was measured.
The energy used is too low to produce any relevant sput-
tering, which could induce a composition variation. Pre-
viously, the substrate was covered with PMMA and a
window was opened to shield the contacts using electron
beam lithography. The number of ions hitting the sample
was estimated to be

1014 Ar ions23.

Information about the sample structure was obtained
using the confocal Raman microscope alpha300R+ from
WITec with an incident laser light of wavelength λ =
532 nm. The device has a lateral resolution of
300 nm
and a depth resolution of
900 nm. The energy was kept
at
3 mW to avoid damage caused by heating eﬀects in
the sample.

III. RESULTS

Using XRD, it was shown that the as-prepared nan-
otube bundles are amorphous and they transform into
anatase after annealing39,40. However, some single nan-
otubes could remain in the amorphous state. Using
confocal Raman spectroscopy, single isolated samples
can be investigated. According to Ohsaka et al.43 for
bulk anatase, Raman peaks can be found at 639 cm−1,
197 cm−1 and 144 cm−1, assigned as Eg modes. B1g
modes are at 513 cm−1 and 399 cm−1, and the band
at 519 cm−1 corresponds to the A1g mode. The Ra-
man Eg band at 144 cm−1 is the most intense peak.
Our results are presented in FIG. 1(e), the peaks corre-
spond to the Eg band, the obtained values are 148 cm−1
and 633 cm−1, respectively, which are diﬀerent compared
to the above mentioned results for the bulk anatase.
This band shift is known as blueshift and is caused due
to phonon conﬁnement in the nanocrystals forming the
nanotube. This eﬀect was already reported for anatase
nanocrystals44, where the shift of the Eg peak as a func-
tion of the annealing temperature was investigated. A
blueshift to 148 cm−1 was obtained for nanocrystals an-
350◦ C, which is in agreement with the an-
nealed at
nealing temperature used for the TiO2 nanotube. From
the blueshift, a crystallite size of
8 nm could be ob-
tained44, which is in agreement with XRD results40. A
y) Raman scan is shown in the inset of FIG. 1(e),
(x
where the bright shades correspond to the Raman Eg
band at 148 cm−1.

The electrical properties of the nanotubes depend
strongly upon the phase and structural quality. A de-
fect free TiO2 anatase nanotubes is electrical insulating.
However, due to growth conditions, defects can be in-
troduced resulting in an electrical conductive material.
For example, such defects are oxygen vacancies (self dop-
ing) produced by a reduction of TiO2, e.g. through elec-
trochemical reactions, gas annealing or exposure to vac-
uum40,45–47, due to a separation of O2 or H2O from termi-
nal oxide or hydroxide groups and bridged oxide and Ti3+

exhibit non-linear I
V curves, which are usually neither
discussed, nor explained in the literature48. Such non-
ohmic behavior could be due to intergrain conduction or
barriers formed on the contacts used for measurements.
For convenience, the measured samples in this work are
sorted in three categories: polycrystalline nanotubes with
linear (Section III A) and non-linear (Section III B) I
V
curves, an amorphous sample (Section III C) and an in-
sulating anatase nanotube which was treated with low-
energy Ar ions (Section III D).

The current-voltage characteristics using Mott VRH
and activated transport processes correspond to linear

V curves (ohmic regime).Therefore, they fail to ex-
V curves as well as R(T ) for such
plain non-linear I
samples. The conduction of the polycrystalline nanotube
depends on the intragrain and intergrain conductivity.
When there is no doping, the grains are insulating with
3 eV. At intermediate doping, the
an energy gap of
charge carriers move to the crystal defects/boundaries
between the grains, which are acting as electronic traps,
and thus a depletion layer is formed with a potential bar-

As can be seen from these equations, the characteristic
temperatures can be obtained through ﬁtting the I

curves and the temperature dependent resistance R(T ).
However, in order to ﬁt the data, a temperature indepen-
dent term R0 in parallel to the FITC conduction process,
has to be added. The parallel contribution is due to dis-
order and impurities present in the TiO2 nanotubes.

In order to ﬁt the data and to reduce the amount of free
parameters, all curves were ﬁtted simultaneously (I
V
curves and R(T )) and the corresponding parameters were
taken as shared parameters for all curves. This means,
that Vc and Is (which depend only weakly on the tem-
V curves,
perature) are shared among the data of the I
and that T1 and T0 are shared among the I
V curves
and R(T ) results. The data and the ﬁts can be seen in

aries. This eﬀect could be avoided by employing long
term annealing at intermediate temperatures, as high-
temperature annealing would result in a collapse of the
TiO2 nanotubes40,41,56,57.

C. Amorphous nanotube

The temperature dependent resistance of an amor-
phous TiO2 nanotube NT3 is shown in FIG. 4. The room
temperature resistance is R(295 K) = 29 MΩ, and thus
much higher than the previously shown samples. There-
fore, the resistance was measured with a constant applied
voltage of V = 10 V and the current was monitored with
a shunt resistance. This implies a two point-probes tech-
nique to be used. However, a large inﬂuence of the con-
tacts is not expected, due to the very high resistance of
the TiO2 nanotube itself. This assumption is supported
by the result of a four-point probes measurement at room
temperature, which yields the same resistance as for the
two-point measurement. Therefore, the inﬂuence of the
contacts will be neglected. The data as well as the ﬁts
are shown in FIG. 4, in the inset the I
V curves can be
seen. As before, all measurements were ﬁtted simultane-
ously. In order to ﬁt the R(T ) data, not only the FITC
model has to be assumed but also a VRH hopping con-
tribution in parallel was needed, see Eq. (1). The shared

low temperature, the constant R0 term in parallel which
is due to impurities/defects, dominates the transport.

D. Ar ion irradiated nanotube

In order to investigate the inﬂuence of defects on the
transport properties of polycrystalline anatase TiO2 nan-
otubes, an almost insulating sample was chosen (see re-
sults in FIG. 5), indicating a high quality of the crys-
talline structure. The sample NT4 has been irradiated
using an Ar/H plasma. The results after irradiation of
the temperature dependent resistance measurements and
I
V curves can be seen in FIG. 5 and its inset. The
used energy of the plasma ions of 50 V and, accord-
ing to SRIM simulations, the resulting penetration depth
is
5 nm, implying that the nanotube is modiﬁed only at
the surface23,27. The sample consists then of an insulat-
ing polycrystalline nanotube surrounded by a conduct-

FIG. 5. The results of the temperature dependent mea-
surements at constant applied voltage of sample NT4 after
Ar/H ion irradiation are presented. The resistance at RT is
RRT = 500 MΩ. The inset shows the I − V curves at diﬀer-
ent temperatures. The continuous lines are the ﬁts obtained
following Eq. (3) for R(T ) and Eq. (5) for the I − V curves.
The resistance before ion irradiation was Ri = 36 GΩ at
T = 240 K and is indicated with blue crosses.

ing TiO2 shell. The FITC model is suitable to describe
such systems, which is in agreement with the non-linear
I
V curves. Although the sample was irradiated homo-
geneously, the conduction can be well described by the
FITC model. This indicates that the defects produced
in the grains induce ﬁnite conductivity, yet the regions
between the grains, i.e. the grain boundaries, remain in-
sulating and are less aﬀected by defects. The sample was
measured using the two-point probes method and shunt
resistance. Due to the high intrinsic resistance, the con-
tact contribution is neglected. The I
V curves and R(T )
were ﬁtted as before, using the characteristic tempera-
tures T1 and T0 and the saturation current Is and criti-
cal voltage Vc as shared parameters. The model to ﬁt the
data was the same as for the other polycrystalline sample
V curves, i.e. the FITC model in par-
with non-linear I

This indicates a larger barrier height compared to the

see Table I, is larger than of sample NT2, indicating a

IV. CONCLUSION

−

−

−

Several anodically grown amorphous and polycrys-
talline TiO2 nanotubes were isolated and prepared for
the measurement of their electrical transport proper-
ties. Raman spectroscopy reveals that the investigated
anatase samples are homogeneous and polycrystalline
with a grain size of a few nanometers. For nanotubes
with linear I
V characteristics a VRH transport mech-
anism explains the measured behavior. In order to de-
scribe the R(T ) and non-linear I
V curves, the FITC
as well as the VRH model are used. Using four contacts,
non-linear I
V curves were measured, which can be
explained considering a barrier formed at the interfaces
between the grains. The ﬂuctuation induced tunneling
conductance describes the resistance results as well as
the non-linear I
V curves for the polycrystalline TiO2
nanotubes. A combination of the FITC model and VRH
was used for the analysis of the resistance of an amor-
phous nanotube. The contacts on the crystalline sam-
ples are ohmic, i.e. there is no barrier, which is important
for future studies and applications. An insulating sample
was irradiated with low-energy Ar/H plasma, and a large
change in the resistivity was produced. This provides the
possibility to modify the electrical transport properties
of individual TiO2 nanotubes through controlled irradi-
ation with ions. In this work, the preparation of single
TiO2 nanotubes with ohmic contacts for electrical trans-
port measurements was demonstrated, which opens new
possibilities for future applications.
