Abstract. We present a quick-start guide to bond, a statistical method
to derive oxygen and nitrogen abundances in H ii regions. bond compares
a set of carefully selected strong and semistrong emission lines to a grid
photoionization models. The ﬁrst novelty, in comparison to other statisti-
cal methods, is that bond relies on the [Ar iii]/[Ne iii] emission line ratio
to break the oxygen abundance bimodality. In doing so, we can measure
oxygen and nitrogen abundances without assuming any a priori relation
between N/O and O/H. The second novelty is that bond takes into ac-
count changes in the hardness of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld, which can
come about due to the ageing of H ii regions or the stochastically sam-
pling of the IMF. We use the emission line ratio He i/Hβ, in addition to
commonly used strong lines, to constrain the hardness of the ionizing ra-
diation ﬁeld. Finally, we also stress the pragmatic considerations behind
our Bayesian inference.

1. Why a statistical method based on photoionization models

When direct temperature measurements are missing, statistical methods are used
to infer abundances in giant H ii regions. There are two families of statistical
methods. One is based on calibrating samples of objects for which the abundance
could be derived from temperature-based methods. The other is based on pho-
toionization model grids. The latter is free from observational biases, but the grid
must cover all the conﬁgurations that could be found in nature. bond (Bayesian
Oxygen and Nitrogen abundance Determinations) belongs to the second family.
bond infers oxygen and nitrogen abundances using carefully selected strong and
semistrong lines by comparing them to a grid of photoionization models. The
source code is open and freely available at http://bond.ufsc.br/. Full details
can be found at Vale Asari et al. (2016). This manuscript is intended to be a
quick-start guide to highlight the most important aspects of the method.

2. What sets bond apart

Common strong line methods based on simple calibrations ([O iii]/[N ii], [N ii]/Hα,
([O ii] + [O iii])/Hβ) assume that emission-line nebulae are a one-parameter fam-
ily, and that such parameter is the oxygen abundance. The ﬁrst to realise the
importance of introducing a secondary parameter to measure abundances was
McGaugh (1991), who considered the eﬀect of the ionization parameter U . Nowa-
days there is a plethora of methods to measure abundances based on the com-
parison of observed to theoretical emission lines from a grid of photoionization
models (McGaugh 1991; Kewley & Dopita 2002; Tremonti et al. 2004; Dopita
et al. 2013; Pérez-Montero 2014; Blanc et al. 2015). We will discuss the diﬀerence
of our method with respect to others.
One novelty in our grid of photoionization models is that we do not impose any a
priori relation between N/O and O/H. The only other method that also does not
tie in the nitrogen and oxygen abundances is the one by Pérez-Montero (2014),
with the diﬀerence that his method uses auroral lines (so it is not a strong line
method), and it selects models around the empirical N/O versus O/H relation if
auroral lines are not available.
Another novelty in our method is that it uses Bayesian inference to measure
abundances, not quite unlike the one by Blanc et al. (2015). The curious reader
is referred to Section 4 for the key points; we warn that, although Bayesian
inference is part and parcel of our method, it is not the most important aspect
of bond.
The killer features in bond are: (a) N/O is free to vary, (b) it distinguishes
between the lower and upper metallicity branches, and (c) it considers the eﬀect
of varying the hardness of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld. The next section shows
how we have tackled (a), (b) and (c), and explains the reasoning behind choosing
which emission lines need to be ﬁtted.

3.

Input emission lines for bond

Our grid of photoionization models spans a wide range in O/H, N/O, and U .
The ionizing radiation ﬁeld is provided by the instantaneous starburst models of
Mollá et al. (2009) for six diﬀerent ages. Two nebular geometries are considered
(thin shell and ﬁlled sphere). We thus have ﬁve parameters in our models. Even
though we are interested in measuring only two of them, O/H and N/O, we still
ought to have good constraints for the other three ‘uninteresting’ parameters:
U , the hardness of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld, and the density structure. That
is why we have chosen a set of emission lines carefully tailored to constrain those
ﬁve parameters all at once.
In the following we list these emission lines and explain the reason behind each
of them. Note that the (reddening-corrected) intensities of all of those lines with
respect to Hβ are needed to run bond.

• The strong lines Hβ, [O ii]λ3726 + λ3729, [O iii]λ5007, and [N ii]λ6584.
They were chosen because, to ﬁrst order, the strong line ratios ([O iii] +
[O ii])/Hβ, [N ii]/[O ii], and [O iii]/[O ii] map into O/H, N/O and U , re-
spectively. We ﬁt line intensities with respect to Hβ, and not the latter

A quick start guide to BOND

3

strong line ratios directly, because we assume that the intensities with re-
spect to Hβ follow a Gaussian distribution when we calculate likelihood
probabilities.

• The semistrong lines [Ar iii]λ7135 and [Ne iii]λ3869 (plus upper limits
for auroral lines of O++and N+). The ratio ([O iii] + [O ii])/Hβ is bi-
valued with respect to the oxygen abundance (see the inverted U shape
of the relation in Fig. 1, left). That is why some methods impose a ﬁxed
relation between N/O versus O/H in their photoionization models (e.g.
Dopita et al. 2013; Blanc et al. 2015). Since we are interested in inferring
both N/O and O/H, we did not want to use nitrogen lines to break the
bimodality in the oxygen abundance. Restricting our search to emission
lines easy to measure in typical optical spectra (though not always reported
in the literature), we found an ideal candidate in the emission line ratio
[Ar iii]/[Ne iii]. Ar++and Ne++are formed in roughly the same zone,
but the excitation potentials of [Ar iii] and [Ne iii] are very diﬀerent (1.7
and 3.2 eV, respectively), so the ratio of these lines is sensitive to the
electronic temperature. Argon and neon are primary elements and their
global abundance ratio is expected to be constant. Besides, they are both
inert, thus do not suﬀer dust depletion, so their abundance ratio in the
ionized gas phase remains constant. Fig. 1 (centre) shows the line ratio
[Ar iii]/[Ne iii] in our grid as a function of [O iii]/[O ii] (the latter traces
the ionization parameter U ). The points are colour-coded as falling in the
lower or upper metallicity branch (blue and red, respectively), showing
that [Ar iii]/[Ne iii] can break the bimodality in the oxygen abundance.
An extra help on ﬁnding the right metallicity branch can come from upper
limits in auroral lines.

• The semistrong line He iλ5876. This is the crucial part of bond. Since we
consider diﬀerent ionization scenarios, e.g. diﬀerent spectral energy distri-
butions (SED) of the ionizing radiation, we need to infer which of those
scenarios is more appropriate. We expect the SED to be diﬀerent in diﬀer-
ent H ii regions due to ageing (so the most massive stars have disappeared)
or due to stochastic eﬀects in low luminosity H ii regions when the upper
part in the stellar initial mass function of the ionizing cluster is not fully
sampled. Fig. 1 (left) shows how the emissivity of ([O iii] + [O ii])/Hβ de-
pends not only on the oxygen abundance (abscissa), but also on he hardness
of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld (colour code). Note that at high metallici-
ties a single value of ([O iii] + [O ii])/Hβ can span 1 dex in oxygen abun-
dance for diﬀerent ionizing radiation ﬁelds. Fig. 1 (right) shows that the
He iλ5876/Hβ line can be used as a proxy of the hardness of the ionizing
radiation ﬁeld.

4. Why go Bayesian

First, let us emphasise that the Bayesian inference is not what sets bond apart.
The heart and soul of bond is the set of carefully selected emission line ratios,
tailor-made both to infer the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in H ii regions,
and to take into account important secondary parameters. As reasoned in the

4

N. Vale Asari et al.

previous section, this allows us to (a) break the bimodality in oxygen abundance
without any a priori relation between N/O versus O/H, and (b) consider the
(previously neglected) role of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld in abundance determi-
nations.
That said, we have opted for Bayesian inference for good reasons. Before diving
into the most important Bayesian aspects, let us examine the method’s acronym.
bond stands for Bayesian Oxygen and Nitrogen abundance Determinations. Our
method is not called Oxygen and Nitrogen abundance, Ionization parameter, and
Hardness of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld Determinations (onihd). The reason
why the letters ih are not in the method’s name is the same reason why we have
decided to introduce the b for Bayesian in its name: the Ionization parameter and
Hardness of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld are nuisance parameters, and the only
way to get rid of them respecting dimensional analysis is by going Bayesian.
Let us lay out the problem to see how its resolution points to Bayesian infer-
ence. We start with a carefully designed photoionization grid, ﬁnely spaced and
spanning a wide range in O/H, N/O, and U . It also considers a few values of
hardness of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld mimicked by diﬀerent SED ages. Even
though the latter two parameters (U and ionizing radiation ﬁeld) are important
and need to be well modelled, they are of secondary interest. This is why our
acronym shifts from onihd to ond.
How do we get rid of parameters for which we do not care (a.k.a. nuisance
parameters)? If we want to consider the probabilities of all models in our grid
at the same time, then we can simply marginalise over the nuisance parameters.
Marginalising is nothing more than integrating over a parameter. For instance,
for a ﬁxed O/H and N/O, we marginalise over U simply by adding up all the
probabilities of all models of a given O/H and N/O for all U . The trick is that
to integrate, say, in dU , the probability density function (PDF) in the integrand
must have physical units of U −1. Ordinary likelihood PDFs (e.g. e−0.5χ2 for
Gaussian distributions1) have units which are the inverse of the observational
data being ﬁtted. So, from a pragmatic point of view, we are obliged to write
out the posterior PDFs, which have the correct physical units when we integrate
over a model parameter. For a thorough argument on the dimensional analysis
of PDFs, see Hogg (2012), especially the discussion around his equation 3.
In other words, going Bayesian gives us licence to kill the nuisance parameters, so
we need to add b to ond. To write the posterior PDFs, we need to spell out our
priors. This has a two-fold beneﬁt. First, we can plug in an informative prior:
if we have empirical evidence that some models are more probable in nature
than others, we can give them more weight by setting the prior probabilities just
right. In our code so far, we have taken the most conservative approach we can
and, following Blanc et al. (2015), we use an uninformative prior (speciﬁcally, a
Jeﬀrey’s prior that is logarithmic in O/H, N/O and U ).
The second beneﬁt of setting a prior is that we have an explicit prescription
for making a ﬁner grid. The problem of comparing data to a uniformly spaced
grid of models by using a χ2 likelihood is that most models will be very distant
from the observed data as measured by the uncertainties σj. If a grid is very

and cj is the computed line intensity.

very rough, the closest model might even be a few σj away from the model with
the highest likelihood. An ad hoc prescription to deal with this problem is by
setting up cooking factors to increase the observed uncertainties, thus decreasing
the distances between observed and computed emission lines. A cooking factor
has no real justiﬁcation and needs to be tailored to work for each new data point.
Since we are using a Bayesian prescription, we can do much better than relying
on ad hoc prescriptions. We simply interpolate our grid where we need—and
interpolation in log N/O, O/H and U is reasonable once the grid is ﬁne enough.
The interpolation is informed by posterior probability of each element in the
grid: if an element has a high probability, it is worth creating more grid points
inside its volume2.
Just a ﬁnal note on the Bayesian parlance. The outcome of a Bayesian inference
is the posterior PDF for a set of model parameters (say, O/H, N/O, U , hardness
of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld). Since we are interested only in O/H and N/O,
we can integrate out all other parameters and obtain the joint O/H and N/O
posterior PDF. The joint PDF is simply a two-dimensional function that gives
the probability of each point in the O/H versus N/O plane, which is the ultimate
goal of bond.
However, sometimes it is unpractical to work with the full joint PDF, so we need
a summarised description in the form 12 + log O/H = 8.35 ± 0.02. There are
many ways to transform a two-dimensional function into a nominal value and a
dispersion. One way is to set the nominal value for N/O and O/H to be the point
where the joint PDF is the highest. We call this number the maximum a poste-
riori (MAP), because it is calculated after (i.e. a posteriori) the marginalisation
of nuisance parameters. For the dispersion, we can deﬁne ellipses of credible
regions that encompass, say, 5, 50, 68 or 95% of the total joint PDF.
If we want to marginalise away either O/H or N/O (i.e. if we are interested
in one of those parameters alone), we can integrate over the other parameter.
Summarising the fully marginalised PDF also opens up a menu of choices. The
nominal value can be taken as the mean, median or mode (that is, its peak) of
the PDF. For the dispersion, the usual choices are either the 50, 68, or 95 percent
equal-tailed or highest density intervals. Note that the equal-tailed intervals are
related to the median. The median is the point in the PDF curve where 50
percent of the probability is to the left and 50 to the right. The equal-tailed
68% interval is the region of a curve where 16 percent of the probability is to
the right and 16 percent to the left. The highest density intervals, on the other
hand, are related to the mode. The mode is the point in the curve of highest
probability. The 68% highest density interval is the region around the mode
that adds up to 68 percent of the total probability. A nice visualisation tool
for those descriptions can be found at http://www.sumsar.net/blog/2014/10/
probable-points-and-credible-intervals-part-one/.

2The algorithm to do importance sampling in bond is the octree sampling, which is compu-
tationally inexpensive. The reader might be more familiar with MCMC samplers, which are
more adequate when one has to compute models on the ﬂy and does not have a pre-deﬁned
grid. In our case, it is much more sensible to compute many photoionization models a priori
and interpolate them on the ﬂy than generating photoionization models on the ﬂy.

Another minor nuisance parameter we marginalise away are the uncertainties.
For [Ar iii]/Hβ, [Ne iii]/Hβ and He i/Hβ, we consider an extra noise source
added in quadrature to the observational uncertainties which we allow to vary
from 2 to 100 percent of the line intensity. The extra noise source is needed
because, in nature, the Ar/O and Ne/O ratios may diﬀer somewhat from the
ones assumed in our model grid. Regarding He i/Hβ, the problem is that our
grid is only coarsely meshed as regards the hardness of the ionizing radiation
ﬁeld. We then calculate the marginalised likelihood PDF for those lines by using
all values of this extra noise and then marginalising it away. We do so because we
do not expect those lines to be completely correct in our photoionization models,
and they are used only to infer secondary parameters.

5. Conclusions

We have highlighted the main characteristics of bond, a method based on a grid
of photoionization models to measure oxygen and nitrogen abundances in giant
H ii regions using strong and semistrong lines. We show why it is important
to consider secondary parameters in abundance determinations, especially the
hardness of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld. The SEDs in H ii regions can vary from
region to region due to stellar ageing or to the stochastically sampling of the IMF.
We also show how one can break the metallicity bimodality without recourse
either to auroral lines or a ﬁxed relation between N/O and O/H. We use a
selective set of emission lines to infer all those parameters. Finally, we argue
why using Bayesian inference is the correct way (motivated by the dimensional
analysis of probability density functions) to treat the secondary parameters in
abundance determinations.
