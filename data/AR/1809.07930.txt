Abstract 

Infrared spectra of Rg1,2 - C6H6 complexes (Rg = He, Ne, Ar) are observed in the region 

of the 12 fundamental of C6H6 using a pulsed supersonic jet expansion and a tunable optical 

parametric oscillator laser source. The mixed trimer He - Ne - C6H6 is also detected. Four 

bands are analyzed for each complex, namely 12 itself (3048 cm-1) and three linked 

combination bands (3079, 3100, and 3102 cm-1). The results are consistent with previous 

ultraviolet and microwave results, with Ne2 - C6H6 and He - Ne - C6H6 being analyzed 

spectroscopically here for the first time.

1.  Introduction 

There is an extensive history of spectroscopic studies of weakly-bound rare gas (Rg) - 

benzene clusters [1], ranging from microwave to ultraviolet wavelength regions, and 

including techniques such as Fourier transform microwave, laser induced fluorescence, 

coherent ion dip, resonant enhanced two photon ionization, and nonlinear Raman 

spectroscopies [2-16]. Rg - benzene dimers have simple structures with the rare gas atom 

localized on the C6 symmetry axis at a distance of about r0 = 3.4 – 3.8 Å (depending on the 

Rg) from the plane of the benzene molecule. For the Rg2 - benzene trimers, the second rare 

gas atom takes up an equivalent position on the other side of the benzene. Thus the trimers 

have D6h point group symmetry similar to benzene monomer (assuming the same Rg atoms), 

while the dimers have C6v symmetry. 

However, there is relatively little work on Rg - benzene spectra in the infrared region, 

with the only previous report being our study of He -, Ne -, and Ar - C6D6 [16] in the region of 

the 12 C-D stretching band of C6D6 near 2289 cm-1. This involved two bands, the 12 

fundamental itself, and the 2 + 13 combination band which is strongly coupled to it by an 

anharmonic (Fermi-type) resonance [17,18]. In the present paper, we extend these C6D6 

results to the analogous C-H stretching band of the principal isotopologue, C6H6, and also 

detect the trimers (e.g. He2 - C6H6) in addition to the dimers. It turns out that the C6H6 12 

region is more complicated than that of C6D6, so that four bands are actually observed, the 

fundamental plus three linked combination vibrations.

2.  Results 

Spectra were obtained with our previously described pulsed supersonic slit jet apparatus 

at the University of Calgary, probed with a Lockheed Martin Aculight Argos optical 

parametric oscillator source [16,18-20]. The expansion gas mixtures contained approximately 

0.02% C6H6 in He carrier gas for He-C6D6, with the addition of a 0.5% Ne or Ar for Ne-C6H6 

or Ar-C6H6. Backing pressures were about 9 atmospheres, and etalon and N2O reference gas 

spectra were simultaneously recorded for wavenumber calibration. The PGopher computer 

program [21] was used for spectral simulation and fitting, including the appropriate nuclear 

spin weights. For C6H6 monomer and He2 -, Ne2 -, and Ar2 - C6H6, which have D6h symmetry, 

these spin weights are: 7 or 3 for K″  = 0, J″  = even or odd; and 11 : 9 : 14 : 9 : 11 : 10 for 

K″  = 1 + 6n : 2 + 6n : 3 + 6n : 4 + 6n : 5 + 6n : 6 + 6n, where n = 0, 1, 2, …. For Rg1 - C6H6 

and He – Ne - C6H6, which have C6v symmetry, the spin weight are: 10 for K″  = 0; and 22 : 

18 : 28 : 18 : 22 : 20 for K″  = 1 + 6n : 2 + 6n : 3 + 6n : 4 + 6n : 5 + 6n : 6 + 6n. 

  As usual for symmetric top molecules, the rotational constant for motion around the 

symmetry axis is not easily determined by spectroscopy and has little direct effect on other 

parameters. In the analyses below, we assume that this parameter (A or C) for the ground 

vibrational state of Rg-C6H6 complexes is equal to that of C6H6 itself, 0.0948753 cm-1 [22]. 

2.1. C6H6 

Our analyses are based on a large and detailed study of the C6H6 monomer spectrum 

made by Pliva and Pine [22] involving the 12 fundamental and 18 perturbing states, which 

5 

included over 8000 transitions and 112 adjustable parameters. Of these 18 perturbers, 3 are 

rather strongly coupled to the fundamental and to each other by Fermi-type interactions, with 

the result that they have band strengths comparable to that of the fundamental itself and are 

easily observed. This situation for C6H6 monomer, as determined in [22], is summarized in 

Table 1, where the four states are labelled A, B, C, and D, following Pliva and Pine. Note the 

very extensive and somewhat complicated mixing of these four vibrations, which results, for 

example, in a re-ordering of the energies of the original unperturbed basis states A, B, C, D to 

a perturbed (observed!) order of A, C, D, B. Note also that perturbed states D and B are 

separated by only about 1.5 cm-1, which means in practice that the two bands overlap each 

other.

a The anharmonic resonance (Fermi-type) parameters linking these vibrations are: WAB = 
23.0206, WBC = 9.0480, WAC = -1.1110, WAD = -1.0641, WBD = 1.5136, WCD = 0.0 cm-1. 
b Some of our perturbed origins do not agree exactly with the values quoted in the abstract of 
[22], notably that of C which was given there as 3078.614. But the “real” origin of C given 
here is indeed correct, as shown by fitting C in isolation which gives an origin of 3078.846. 
c Fractional parentages are the squares of the eigenvectors of the diagonalized energy matrix. 

We observed these same four bands for the Rg - C6H6 complexes, as described below. For 

their analysis, we followed the scheme of Pliva and Pine, and kept most of the anharmonic 

interaction parameters, W, fixed at their monomer values from [22].   

2.2. He - C6D6 and He2 - C6H6 

In 1979, Beck et al. [2] observed the S1  S0 61

0 vibronic band (38610 cm-1) for both 

He1 - C6H6 and He2 - C6H6 using laser induced fluorescence in a pulsed supersonic jet 

expansion with an effective rotational temperature of about 0.3 K. More recently, this band 

 
 
 
 
7 

was re-examined by Hayashi and Ohshima [3] with improved spectral resolution (<0.01 cm-1) 

using resonant enhanced two photon ionization spectroscopy. Their analysis yielded ground 

state B-values of 0.1220 and 0.0876 cm-1 for the dimer and trimer, respectively, which 

resulted in intermolecular distances of r0 = 3.602 or 3.596 Å (these are for the distance 

between the He atom(s) and the benzene plane). A detailed ab initio potential surface for 

He-C6H6 has been reported by Lee et al. [10], together with nonlinear Raman spectra of some 

intermolecular vibrations 

We observed He1,2 - C6H6 spectra accompanying all four benzene bands in the 3040 - 

3110 cm-1 range, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (recall that the B and D bands near 3100 cm-1 

overlap). The jet expansion conditions resulted in He1 and He2 spectra whose strongest 

features were not much weaker than those of the C6H6 monomer itself. This is shown by the 

simulated spectra in Fig. 1, which are based on our analyses described below. The strongest 

features are Q-branches which contain many transitions which are unresolved due to the low 

effective rotational temperature (2.5 K) and relatively small changes in B-values. Hence the 

number of assigned lines is considerably less than the number of assigned transitions. For 

example, the number of assigned lines for He1 - C6H6 was 191 while the number of transitions 

was 340. The spacing of these Q-branches varies greatly, so that the ‘look’ of each band also 

varies. Since this spacing is approximately given by 2[B' – C' (1 – ζ)], the Q-branches 

collapse into a single feature when ζ = (1 – B'/C'), as is (almost) the case for He1 – C6H6 at 

3101.92 cm-1 in the B band (Fig. 1).

a In all cases, C (or A) was fixed at the following C6H6 values from Pliva and Pine [22]: 0.0948573 (ground state); 0.0947423 (state A); 0.0946436 
(state B); 0.0946220 (state C); 0.0947774 (state D). Similarly, all anharmonic resonance parameters except WAB were fixed: WBC = 9.0480; WAC = 
-1.1110; WAD = -1.0641; WBD = 1.5136; WCD = 0.0; AB = -0.5540e-4; BC = 1.6339e-4 (all values in cm-1). C6H6 monomer parameters are from 
Table III of Pliva and Pine [22], except that the band origins were fitted to present data, with all other C6H6 parameters fixed at their Pliva and Pine 
values (see text). For Ne – and Ar – C6H6, ground state parameters are from Brupbacher et al. [13], and excited state DJ' and DJK' parameters are 
fixed at ground state values. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 

Our analysis was made using the symmetric rotor Hamiltonian in the PGopher program 

[21]. For He1 - C6H6, the ground state parameters B″ and DJ″ were varied, as well as the 

excited state parameters ν0, B', DJ', and ζ for each of the four vibrations A to D. In addition, 

the largest of the anharmonic interaction parameters, WAB, was varied. Meanwhile, many 

parameters were fixed at C6H6 values [22], including the ground and excited state C-values 

and the remaining interaction parameters, W and . For He2 - C6H6, the situation was the 

same except that some DJ parameters were not well determined and were fixed to zero. The 

results of these fits are shown in Table 2.   

2.3. Ne1 - C6D6, Ne2 - C6H6, and He - Ne - C6H6 

Ne1 - C6H6 has been studied previously by electronic [4] and microwave [12,13] 

spectroscopy, but as far as we know there are no previous reports of Ne2 - C6H6. The present 

Ne spectra are shown in Fig. 2. In analyzing the Ne1 spectrum, we had the advantage of very 

precise ground state parameters (B″, DJ″, and DJK″) from the microwave studies [13]. A total 

of 135 lines were assigned in terms of 380 transitions, and fitted by varying the excited state 

ν0, B', and ζ parameters for each of the four vibrations, plus the WAB interaction parameter 

(see Table 2). Other parameters were fixed as for He1 - C6H6, and in addition the excited state 

DJ', and DJK' parameters were fixed to their ground state microwave values.

For Ne2 - C6H6, the number of assigned lines was much smaller (41), as can perhaps be 

understood by looking at Fig. 2. Moreover, there were no previous data for the ground state 

(from symmetry, Ne2 - C6H6 has no permanent dipole moment and hence no microwave 

spectrum). The analysis varied the ground state B″, the excited state ν0, B', and ζ for the four 

vibrations, and WAB, with results as shown in Table 2. 

As already mentioned, helium was used as the carrier gas in the mixture used to obtain 

the Ne spectra, relying on the much larger binding energy of Ne to yield mostly Ne1,2 - C6H6 

in the resulting supersonic expansion. But in fact He1 - C6H6 was still present in our spectra, 

with an intensity roughly 10% that of Ne1 - C6H6. Furthermore, the mixed trimer He - Ne - 

C6H6 was also present and we were able to assign a number of lines to it. The resulting 

simulated spectra are shown at the bottom of the panels in Fig. 2. Most of the assigned lines 

were Q-branch transitions, which provide almost no information about B-values. By 

assigning some very weak observed R-branch transitions, and constraining the ground and 

excited B-values to be equal, we were able to obtain a meaningful, but tentative, value of 

0.02983 cm-1 for B. The He - Ne - C6H6 analysis is summarized in Table 3.

2.4. Ar1 - C6H6 and Ar2-C6H6 

Similar to the Ne case, Ar-benzene dimers have been extensively studied: a high level ab 

initio calculation and references to previous work are given by Fernández et al. [23], and 

accurate ground state constants (B, DJK, DJ) are available for Ar1 - C6H6 [13]. Our spectra are 

shown in Fig. 3. For the dimer, Ar1 - C6H6, a total of 138 lines involving 461 transitions were 

fitted to give the parameters listed in Table 2, varying the same 13 upper state parameters as 

for Ne1 - C6H6.   

For the trimer, Ar2 – C6H6, electronic spectra have been observed previously [5], and a 

ground state B″-value was thus available. But we felt that we could determine B″ with 

comparable accuracy and therefore allowed it to vary in the analysis along with the same 13 

upper state parameters as for Ne2 - C6H6, with results as shown in Table 2. There were 27 

assigned lines involving 211 transitions. There was some evidence for the presence of the 

mixed trimer He - Ar - C6H6 in our spectra, but the tentatively assigned transitions were 

insufficient for a meaningful analysis. 

3.  Discussion 

3.1. ζ-values, B-values, and intermolecular distances 

Tables 2 and 3 show that the addition of one or two rare gas atoms to C6H6 has little 

effect on the Coriolis zeta (ζ) parameters of the individual vibrational modes, just as observed 

for Rg – C6D6 dimers [16]. This is not surprising, since it simply indicates that the 

weakly-bound Rg atom does not have much effect on the interactions among the 

16 

intramolecular benzene vibrations. As noted above (Sec. 2.2), the quantity 2[B – C (1 – ζ)] 

has a significant effect on the overall appearance of the bands. The parameters C and ζ remain 

mostly unchanged with the addition of Rg atoms, but of course the B-value, and hence the 

band appearance, does change significantly. 

Our ground state B-values for He1- and He2 - C6H6 are 0.12203(5) and 0.08765(7) cm-1, 

respectively, which agree very well with the slightly less precise values of 0.1220(2) and 

0.0876(2) cm-1 reported by Hayashi and Ohshima [3] (these are 3 uncertainties). In the case 

of Ar2 - C6H6, our ground state B-value of 0.01514(3) cm-1 is slightly lower than value of 

0.01517(2) cm-1 reported by Weber and Neusser [5]. For Ne2 - C6H6 and He - Ne - C6H6 there 

are no previous B-value determinations with which to compare. Finally, for Ne1- and Ar1 - 

C6H6 there are very accurate previous microwave B-values, as already noted [12,13].

Effective intermolecular distances (Rg atom to benzene plane) resulting from these 

B-values are summarized in Table 4. Here we use the C6H6 B-value as given in Table 2 [22], 

and also assume that the rare gas atoms are rigidly located on the benzene symmetry axis. 

The latter point is discussed in [12], where it is shown that allowing for the off-axis motion of 

Ne significantly affects (0.05 Å) the intermolecular distance obtained for Ne – C6H6, but in 

most cases we do not have isotopic data to evaluate this effect. From Table 4 we see that the 

distances vary from 3.599 Å for He1, down to 3.458 Å for Ne1, and back up to 3.581 Å for 

Ar1, due to the competing effects of atomic ‘size’ (larger for Ar) and zero-point motion (larger 

for He). The distances become smaller when a second rare gas atom is added, as expected due 

to the (relatively weak) attractive effects between the two atoms. For Ar, the effect appears to 

be very small (0.001 Å), but this could be due to uncertainty in our Ar2 – C6H6 B-value (if the 

B-value from [5] is used, the shrinkage becomes 0.004 Å). We cannot separately evaluate the 

two intermolecular distances for He - Ne - C6H6, but the observed B-value is consistent with a 

slight shrinkage compared to He - C6H6 and Ne - C6H6.

Vibrational shifts 

The most novel results of the present study are perhaps the vibrational shifts, that is, the 

differences between the band origins of the various Rg – benzene clusters and those of 

benzene itself. However, ready interpretation of these shifts is made a bit difficult by the 

complicated nature of the four coupled benzene vibrations as described in Table 1. The 

observed shifts are summarized in Table 5, which give values for both the deperturbed and 

perturbed (observed) origins of bands A, B, C, and D. For each Rg atom, we list the shift for 

Rg1 - and Rg2 - C6H6 as well as twice the value of the Rg1 shift. In most cases, the Rg2 shift is 

quite similar to twice the Rg1 shift, as expected, and this is especially true for the ‘observed’

origins, which are probably more meaningful. For the mixed trimer, He - Ne - C6H6, we 

similarly compare shifts with the sum of those of He1 and Ne1 and also find rough agreement. 

The Ar shifts tend to be more negative (red shift) and larger in magnitude than those of 

He, with Ne falling in between. This trend is similar to many other weakly-bound complexes, 

for example Rg - CO [24]. Looking at the individual bands (observed origins), we find that 

band A is invariably the most red-shifted, and band B the least red-shifted, with C and D 

being intermediate and similar to each other. Table 5 contains rather subtle information about 

interactions between the Rg atoms and the various benzene vibrations, but any further 

interpretation is difficult at this point. 

4.  Conclusions 

In conclusion, we report here the first spectroscopic investigation of rare gas – C6H6 

complexes in the infrared region, complementing our earlier study of Rg – C6D6 [16]. Both 

Rg1 and Rg2 complexes were observed for Rg = He, Ne, and Ar, and the mixed trimer He - 

Ne - C6H6 was also detected. In all cases, the Rg atoms are located on the C6 symmetry axis 

at distances of about 3.5 Å from the plane of the benzene molecule. More precisely, the 

observed B-values give intermolecular distances of about 3.60, 3.45, and 3.58 Å for He, Ne, 

and Ar, respectively. The somewhat complicated pattern of four bands linked with the 12 

vibration of C6H6 is preserved virtually intact in the Rg complexes, with vibrational shifts of 

<1 cm-1 (<0.03%). As well, the Coriolis zeta parameters of the four modes remain little 

changed in the complexes.
