Abstract We analyzed temporal and periodic behavior of sunspot counts (SSCs)
in ﬂaring (C, M, or X class ﬂares), and non-ﬂaring active regions (ARs) for the
almost two solar cycles (1996 through 2016). Our main ﬁndings are as follows:
i) The temporal variation of monthly means of daily total SSCs in ﬂaring and
non-ﬂaring ARs are diﬀerent and these diﬀerences are also varying from cycle to
cycle; temporal proﬁle of non-ﬂaring ARs are wider than the ﬂaring ones during

the solar cycle 23, while they are almost the same during the current cycle 24.
The second peak (second maximum) of ﬂaring ARs are strongly dominate during
current cycle 24, while this diﬀerence is not such a remarkable during cycle 23.
The amplitude of SSCs in the non-ﬂaring ARs are comparable during the ﬁrst
and second peaks (maxima) of the current solar cycle, while the ﬁrst peak is
almost not existent in case of the ﬂaring ARs. ii) Periodic variations observed in
SSCs of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs are quite diﬀerent in both MTM spectrum
and wavelet scalograms and these variations are also diﬀerent from one cycle to
another; the largest detected period in the ﬂaring ARs is 113 days, while there
are much higher periodicities (327, 312, and 256 days) in non-ﬂaring ARs. There
are no meaningful periodicities in MTM spectrum of ﬂaring ARs exceeding 45
days during solar cycle 24, while a 113 days periodicity detected from ﬂaring
ARs of solar cycle 23. For the non-ﬂaring ARs the largest period is 72 days
during solar cycle 24, while the largest period is 327 days during current cycle.

1. Introduction

Our sun is a variable star and it shows diﬀerent kind of variations such as
sunspots, solar ﬂares, prominences, coronal mass ejections etc., as depending on
the observed wavelength and depth. These variations can be traced easily by
observing such solar activity indicators, as sunspot numbers (SSNs), sunspot
areas (SSAs), 10.7 cm solar radio ﬂux (F10.7), solar ﬂare index (FI), total solar
irradiance (TSI), etc. All of these indicators describe solar activity quite well.
Due to the longest temporal coverage (about 400 years), sunspots are one of
the most important and commonly used indicators. Studies on variations in
solar activity are important for understanding the mechanism behind the solar
activity and solar cycle, and also for predicting the level of activity (Hathaway,
2009; Petrovay, 2010). The properties of solar cycle are generally described by the
Zurich or international sunspot number, RZ = k(10g+f), where k is a correction
factor for the observer, g is the number of identiﬁed sunspot groups, and f is the
number of individual sunspots. According to this equation daily sunspot number
strongly related to the number of observed group for a day.

In the photosphere the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld is manifested
by the appearance of dark sunspots or pores and bright faculae representing
concentrated and dispersed magnetic ﬁelds, respectively. In general, sunspots
are observed as groups on the active regions (ARs) of solar surface and they
are classiﬁed according to their morphology and evolution. The ARs may be
classiﬁed in terms of the morphology of the sunspot groups. The most common
classiﬁcation of ARs was introduced by McIntosh (1990). The McIntosh Sunspot
Classiﬁcation Scheme (MSCS) assigns three descriptive codes characterizing the
size (A, B, C, D, E, F, H), penumbra (X, R, S, A, H, and K) and compactness (X,
O, I, and C) of ARs. The simplest ARs have bipolar magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations,
but ARs may be built-up by several bipoles emerging in close succession. In this
classiﬁcation A and B classes describe very tiny small SGs and they produce very

rare ﬂare, while D, E and F describe strongly evaluated complex ones and most
of the ﬂares produced by these evaluated groups. Note that in the calculation of
daily sunspot number all SGs have the same weight.

All solar activity indicators show a periodic behavior with period ranging
from days to hundreds of years. The best-known solar periodic variations are
the eleven year sunspot cycle and the 27-day solar rotation periodicity that is
induced by large long-lived ARs with lifetimes longer than one solar rotation.
Investigations of possible periodicities other than these two periods have been of
interest for a long time. Let us recall these studies; in 1984, Rieger (Rieger et al.,
1984) was the ﬁrst to reveal a 158-day periodicity in the Sun, while studying
γ-ray ﬂare data from Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) in solar cycle 21 (C21).
Approximately, the same periodicity was also discovered in X–ray ﬂares data
taken from the Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)
for the same solar cycle (Rieger et al., 1984). This was only the beginning in a
sequence of relevant investigations. In the context of these attempts, it is notable
that apart from the Rieger periodicity itself, numerous other periodicities were
discovered, such as 128, 102, 78 and 51-day periodicities (Bai and Sturrock, 1991;
Bai, 1992). Consequently, Rieger periodicity was connected to highly energetic
ﬂares which are presumably triggered by the emergence of photospheric magnetic
ﬂux with the same period (Ballester, Oliver, and Baudin, 1999; Ballester, Oliver,
and Carbonell, 2002). The most important short-time periodicities in diﬀerent
kinds of solar activity, as reported before, are as follows: i) a 153-day period in Hα
ﬂare importance (Ichimoto et al., 1985), hard X–ray peak rate (Dennis, 1985;
Bai and Sturrock, 1987; Verma et al., 1991), in ﬂare index (Ozguc and Atac,
1989, 1994; Ozguc, Atac, and Rybak, 2003), 10.7–cm radio peak ﬂux (Kile and
Cliver, 1991), and production of energetic electrons in the interplanetary space
(Droege et al., 1990); ii) 323– and 540-day periodicities in daily sunspot number
and sunspot area (Oliver, Carbonell, and Ballester, 1992) in ﬂare index (Kilcik
et al., 2010); iii) a quasi–period of about 160 days in the photospheric magnetic
ﬂux (Ballester, Oliver, and Carbonell, 2002); iv) 157±11 day periodicity in X–ray
ﬂares greater than M5 (Lou et al., 2003).

On the other hand, large-scale solar activity is produced by the energy stored
active region magnetic ﬁelds. Consequently ﬂares often occur at sites in active
regions overlying neutral lines where ﬁelds are strongly sheared. Observations
show that the photospheric topology of the magnetic ﬁeld is one of the key factors
in determining the evolution of ARs. There is a general trend for large ARs to
produce large ﬂares and for more complex ARs to generate more numerous and
larger ﬂares than other ARs of similar size (Sammis, Tang, and Zirin, 2000).
Here, we separated SGs in two categories based on their ARs ﬂare productivity:
if a sunspot group produced any ﬂare (C, M, and X class ﬂares) during its
evolution we count it as a ﬂaring AR, otherwise we count it as a non-ﬂaring
AR. Then, we analyzed temporal and periodic behavior of the sunspot counts
(SSCs) in these ARs and in an attempt to more comprehensively describe general
characteristics of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs for the last two solar cycles (1996
through 2016). We hope, this study will bring better understanding of the solar
cycle, the background physical phenomena, and consequently it may increase
the knowledge about Sun-Earth interactions.

2. Data and Analysis Method

In this study, we investigate temporal and periodic variations of sunspot counts
depending on the ﬂare production of ARs. The group classiﬁcation and the ﬂare
data are only available since August 1996. Therefore, the analyzed time interval
covers only solar cycle 23 (1996 through 2008) and the ascending and maximum
phases of current cycle 24 (2009 through 2016). The raw data are taken from
the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC)1. These data sets include all
X-Ray ﬂares and AR informations. The daily total sunspot counts for ﬂaring
and non-ﬂaring ARs were calculated. To compare the temporal variations of
sunspot counts (SSCs) in ﬂaring and nonﬂaring ARs for the investigated time
period the monthly mean values were calculated. Then, to remove the short term
ﬂuctuations and reveal the long term trend a 12 steps running averaging was
applied.

To reveal periodic variations in the SSC data two period analysis methods,
Multitaper Method (MTM) and Morlet Wavelet Analysis, were applied with red
noise approximations and 95% conﬁdence level. Both method have previously
been successfully used analysis of solar data (Prestes et al., 2006; Kilcik et al.,
2010; Mufti and Shah, 2011; Deng et al., 2013; Choudhary et al., 2014; Kilcik
et al., 2014b, 2016, and reference therein).

To obtain the periodicities with high conﬁdence level we used the MTM anal-
ysis method which enables us to detect low-amplitude harmonic oscillations in
relatively short time-series with a high degree of statistical signiﬁcance rejecting
larger amplitude harmonics if the F-test (variance test) fails. This feature is
an important advantage of the MTM over other classical methods (for details
see, (Jenkins and Watts, 1969; Ghil et al., 2002)). In this study we used three
sinusoidal tapers, and the frequency range was chosen from 0.0018 to 0.04 (i.e.
25 – 546 days).

To localize the periodicities obtained from the MTM analysis we applied the
Morlet Wavelet analysis method to the daily SSC data separately for ﬂaring and
nonﬂaring ARs. The Morlet wavelet is a complex sine wave, localized within a
Gaussian window (Morlet et al., 1982). The method is a powerful tool for analyz-
ing localized power variations within a time series (Torrence and Compo, 1998).
The standard Interactive Data Language (IDL) packages for Morlet wavelet
analysis were used, and the scalograms were obtained to study both the presence
and evolution of the periodicities.

3. Results

Figure 1 shows the temporal variations of SSCs in ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs
for the investigated time interval (from 1996 to 2016). In general, the monthly
means of the daily total SSCs in the ﬂaring ARs are four times larger than the
non-ﬂaring ones. We emphasize that the SSCs in both data sets follows sunspot

cycle with some diﬀerences: First, SSCs in the non-ﬂaring ARs show a wider
temporal proﬁle than that of the ﬂaring ARs. Second, SSCs in the non-ﬂaring
ARs have multiple peaks during the maximum phase of solar cycle 23, while
the ﬂaring ARs have two prominent peaks at the same phase. Third, SSCs in
the non-ﬂaring ARs have comparable magnitude of the ﬁrst and second peaks
in the current solar cycle, while the ﬁrst peak is almost not existent in case of
the ﬂaring ARs. Finally, there is a well deﬁned peak in SSCs of the non-ﬂaring
ARs during 2006–2007, while that peak is not so prominent in case of the ﬂaring
ARs.

Figure 2 and 3 show observed periods of SSCs in ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs
and their localizations during the solar cycle 23. Detected periods are quite
diﬀerent in both MTM spectrum and wavelet scalograms: i) the largest detected
period in the ﬂaring ARs is 113 days, while there are much higher periodicities
(327, 312, and 256 days) in non-ﬂaring ARs, ii) there is a very prominent 45
day peak in non-ﬂaring ARs, which does not appear in ﬂaring ARs. The only
similarity between the periodicities of the two data sets is the existence of solar
rotation periods (27-35 days). We note that all periods detected with the MTM
appear in the wavelet scalograms, but signiﬁcance level of some periodicities is
below the 95% conﬁdence level.

Figure 4 and 5 show the SSCs periodic variations for the ascending and
the maximum phases of solar cycle 24 which also show remarkable diﬀerences

between the ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs: There are no meaningful periodicities
in MTM spectrum of ﬂaring ARs exceeding 45 days, while we detect 72 day
periodicity in non-ﬂaring ARs. Note that some larger periodicities (about 250
and 600 days) appear in the wavelet scalograms of non-ﬂaring ARs. Again solar
rotation periodicities exist in both cases.

We also noted that in general, the appearance of all well deﬁned periodicities
(except the solar rotation period) are shifted toward the late phase of both cycle
wavelet scalograms of the ﬂaring ARs, while the non-ﬂaring ARs do not show
such a shift.

In Table 1, we list signiﬁcant periods that appeared in ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring
ARs in solar cycles 23 and 24. The table shows ﬁve signiﬁcant points: i) large
periods (>113 day) exist only in the SSCs of non-ﬂaring ARs, ii) a 113 day
periodicity appear only in ﬂaring ARs of solar cycle 23, iii) 72 and 55 days periods
exist only in the non-ﬂaring ARs of current cycle 24, iv) a 45 day periodicity

4. Conclusions and Discussions

Here we analyzed temporal and periodic behavior of SSCs in ﬂaring and non-
ﬂaring ARs and in an attempts to better explain diﬀerent behaviors of these ARs
for the last two solar cycles (1996 through 2016). We have two main ﬁndings.

i) The temporal variation of monthly means of daily total SSCs in ﬂaring and
non-ﬂaring ARs are diﬀerent and these diﬀerences are also varying from cycle
to cycle; temporal proﬁle of non-ﬂaring ARs are wider than the ﬂaring ones
during the solar cycle 23, while they are almost the same during the current
cycle 24. The second peak of ﬂaring ARs are strongly dominate during current
cycle 24, while this diﬀerence is not such a remarkable during solar cycle 23.
SSCs in the non-ﬂaring ARs have comparable magnitude of the ﬁrst and
second peaks in the current solar cycle, while the ﬁrst peak is almost not
existent in case of the ﬂaring ARs

peaks are labeled with the period in days in the MTM power spectrum. The horizontal dashed

ii) Periodic variations observed in SSCs of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs are quite
diﬀerent in both MTM spectrum and wavelet scalograms and these variations
are also diﬀerent from cycle to cycle; the largest detected period in the ﬂaring
ARs is 113 days, while there are much higher periodicities (327, 312, and
256 days) in non-ﬂaring ARs. There are no meaningful periodicities in MTM
spectrum of ﬂaring ARs exceeding 45 days during current cycle 24, while a
113 days periodicity detected from ﬂaring ARs of solar cycle 23. For the non-
ﬂaring ARs the largest period is 72 days during current cycle 24, while the
largest period is 327 days during solar cycle 23.

4.1. Temporal variation of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring active regions

In the recent years, many studies were focused on the understanding of temporal
variation of solar activity indicators (e.g. SSCs, SSAs, Solar X-Ray ﬂares) in
various categories and found that these variations change during a solar cycle and

from one cycle to another. Kilcik et al. (2011) ﬁrst separated sunspot groups in
two categories as small and large and analyzed the temporal variation of the SG
numbers for the last four solar cycles (Cycles 20, 21, 22 and 23). They conclude
that these two categories behave diﬀerently during a cycle. In the following years,
these diﬀerent behavior of sunspot groups are conﬁrmed by diﬀerent authors
from diﬀerent solar activity indicator data sets (Lefevre and Clette, 2011; Gao,
Shi, and Li, 2012; Nagovitsyn, Pevtsov, and Livingston, 2012; Javaraiah, 2013;
Gomez, Curto, and Gras, 2014; Kilcik et al., 2014a,b; Gao and Zhong, 2016,
and reference therein). Here, we separated sunspot groups in two categories
as ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs according to their ﬂare production. Then, we
investigated the temporal variations of sunspot counts in these ARs for the last
two solar cycles. We found that ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs behave diﬀerently for
diﬀerent cycles; ﬂaring ARs have remarkable peaks at the second peaks of both
solar cycle 23 and 24, while these two peaks have almost the same amplitude in
case of the non-ﬂaring ARs during the both cycles. SSCs in the non-ﬂaring ARs
show a wider temporal proﬁle than that of the ﬂaring ARs. Also SSCs in the non-
ﬂaring ARs have multiple peaks during the maximum phase of solar cycle 23,
while the ﬂaring ARs have two prominent peaks at the same phase.These results
show that the ﬂaring ARs are better describe the large sunspot groups compared
to non-ﬂaring ones. Thus, we conﬁrm that the most of the ﬂare activity occur
in large and complex SGs and further conclude that the temporal variations of
ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs are quite diﬀerent.

4.2. Periodic variation of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring active regions

Lean and Brueckner (1989) found a 323 day periodicity in various solar activity
indicators which were the sunspot-blocking function, Zurich sunspot numbers,
F10.7, and CaII K plage index. They concluded that this periodicity can have
a real solar origin. Later Kilcik et al. (2014a) separated sunspot groups in four
categories as small (A and B), medium (C), large (D, E, F) and ﬁnal (H Mod-
iﬁed Zurich Classes) and investigated the periodic variation of SSCs in these
categories. They found this periodicity as 315 – 348 days in all categories except
simple ones (A and B Zurich classes). Recently, Kilcik et al. (2016) analyzed
periodicities of the central latitude of SSGs (active latitude) and found about
300-370 days periodicities by using of MTM and the Morlet wavelet analysis
techniques for the South hemisphere of solar cycle 18, the North hemisphere
during solar cycle 20 and both North and South hemispheres of solar cycle 23.
Here we analyzed SSCs periodicities in ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs and found
that this periodicity exist only in SSCs of non-ﬂaring ARs of cycle 23.

293 and 256 days periodicities found in this study were also reported previ-
ously by diﬀerent authors (Sello, 2003; Lou et al., 2003; Kilcik et al., 2010, and
reference therein). Chowdhury, Khan, and Ray (2009) have reported a 261 day
period from sunspot areas by means of Scargle periodogram and Morlet wavelet
transform for cycles 22 and 23. Lou et al. (2003) have found these periods as
259.48 ±24.23 days by applying the Fourier power spectral analysis to X-ray
ﬂares exceeding M5 class during the maximum phase of Cycle 23 (1999 - 2003),
Scafetta and Willson (2013) were also found a 293 day periodicity from the TSI

to 2013.16 (descending phase of Cycle 23 and ascending phase of Cycle 24). Here
we found that these two periods also exist in non-ﬂaring active regions of solar
cycle 23. Note that about 256 days period appear in the wavelet scalogram of
SSCs in non-ﬂaring ARs of current cycle 24, but its signiﬁcance level is below
the 95% conﬁdence level in the MTM spectrum. Thus we may suggest that these
large periodicities may arise from the non-ﬂaring well developed SGs.

Lou et al. (2003) found 122.19±4.88 day periodicity by means of the Fourier
power spectra analysis of X-ray ﬂares exceeding M5 class during the maximum
phase of cycle 23 (1999 - 2003). Ozguc, Atac, and Rybak (2002) have investigated
the periodicity of solar H-alpha ﬂare index during the ascending branch and
the maximum phase of solar cycle 23, and reported that the 116- and 125-day
periodicities are in operation during the investigated time period. Later, Kilcik
et al. (2010) analyzed H-alpha solar ﬂare index data by using MTM and Morlet
wavelet analysis techniques for 1976-2007 time intervals. They investigated the
cyclic variation of whole data and each cycle (Cycle 21, 22, and 23) separately
and found a 113 day period from whole and cycle 23 data. Later, Kilcik et al.
(2014b) found this period in the SSCs of the simple and ﬁnal groups. We found
that this periodicity only appears in the ﬂaring ARs of solar cycle 23. Thus,
we conﬁrm above results and further argue that this periodicity is one of the
characteristic periodicity of solar ﬂares and also ﬂaring ARs.

We detected 72 and 54–56 day periods from only non-ﬂaring ARs of current
cycle 24. Those periods are also reported in the literature by diﬀerent authors
(Zieba et al., 2001; Bai, 2003; Ozguc, Atac, and Rybak, 2003; Dimitropoulou,
Moussas, and Strintzi, 2008; Kilcik et al., 2010; Chowdhury, Jain, and Awasthi,
2013; Kilcik et al., 2014b, 2016, and reference therein). Kilcik et al. (2010)
analyzed the periodicity of H-alpha ﬂare index data for the solar cycle 21, 22,
and 23. They detected these periodicities from solar cycles 21 and 22, but not
from solar cycle 23 data. Scafetta and Willson (2013)analyzed the TSI data
by using a multiscale dynamical spectral analysis technique from 2003.15 to
2013.16 (descending phase of Cycle 23 and ascending phase of Cycle 24) and
detected a 73 day period. Recently, Kilcik et al. (2014b) analyzed the periodic
variations of SSCs in diﬀerent categories and found these two periodicities; a 73
day periodicity found in all categories except ﬁnal (H groups) ones, and a 53
day periodicity detected in all categories. Note that about 55 day period exist
in all situations but their signiﬁcance level just below the 95% conﬁdence level,
also it appears in the wavelet scalograms.

We detect a 45 day period from SSCs of ﬂaring ARs of both solar cycle (Cycle
23 and 24). This periodicity also reported previously by diﬀerent authors (Bai,
2003; Lou et al., 2003; Lara et al., 2008; Dimitropoulou, Moussas, and Strintzi,
2008; Kilcik et al., 2010, 2014b, 2016, and reference therein). Lou et al. (2003)
investigate periodicities of X-Ray solar ﬂares by using Fourier power spectral
analyses method and Morlet wavelet analysis from 1999 to 2003 and found about
42 days period. Later, Lara et al. (2008) investigate the short term periodicity
of number of coronal mass ejection by means of the maximum entropy method
(MEM) and wavelet analysis during solar cycle 23 and found about 45 day
period. Recently, Chowdhury et al. (2015) studied quasi-periodic variations of

SSA/SSN, 10.7 cm solar radio ﬂux, average photospheric magnetic ﬂux by means
of Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Morlet wavelet analyses during solar cycle 24
(from 2009 January to 2013 August). They detected 43 and 45 day periods from
SSA and SSNs and 45 day period from 10.7 cm solar radio ﬂux, but not in the
average photospheric magnetic ﬂux data. We conﬁrm above results and further
found that a 45 day period is only appearing in the ﬂaring ARs data of both
solar cycles (Cycles 23 and 24). Thus we may conclude that this period is one of
the fundamental periods of only ﬂaring ARs and it may be used as a separator
between ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs.

26–35 days solar rotation periodicity reported in the literature by many au-
thors from diﬀerent solar activity indicators (Bouwer, 1992; Bai, 2003; Kilcik
et al., 2010; Chowdhury and Dwivedi, 2011; Kilcik et al., 2014b, 2016, and
reference therein). This periodicity does not show any AR preference. It can
be expected because the life time of many evaluated SGs are longer than one
solar rotation. Therefore those SGs may appear longer than one solar rotation
and aﬀect the observed daily SSCs. Slight variations could also occur if the
active region had a slow longitudinal movement ahead of, or lagging behind the
rotation.

4.3. Physical interpretation

Parker (1955)’s dynamo equations, which can be rigorously derived from the
general mean-ﬁeld dynamo equations are today the most common scheme of
magnetic ﬁeld generation (Fioc, Nesme-Ribes, and Sokoloﬀ, 1996; Krause and
Radler, 1980). In this scheme, the dipole magnetic ﬁeld is transformed by the
diﬀerential rotation into near-equatorial local ﬁeld of active regions (Ω branch
dynamo). At the second step the polar ﬁeld is restored from the local ﬁelds
(branch α). This assumes one cell of meridional circulation. Field transport from
the pole to the equator occurs at the lower boundary of the convection zone
(tachocline), while the movement from equator to pole just below the surface.

This is a greatly simpliﬁed scheme and is currently undergoing considerable
criticism and is complemented by a variety of details. In particular, it is unclear
how magnetic ﬁeld generated at the base of the convection zone rises up, and
in which form it is made available to the observations at the photosphere level.
Nevertheless, an important argument in favor of this branch of the dynamo is
the high correlation between the polar ﬁeld at the minimum of the cycle and the
next maximum (Obridko and Shelting, 2008).

But why change the polar ﬁeld? The process of restoration of the polar ﬁeld
to the end is not clear. The most common mechanism is of Babcock-Leighton
(Babcock, 1961; Leighton, 1969; Upton and Hathaway, 2014). However still un-
clear, what is the ratio of two processes - advection and diﬀusion (Georgieva,
2011; Obridko, Nagovitsyn, and Georgieva, 2012).

Some of the diﬃculties in the mechanism of Babcock-Leighton are that the
total magnetic ﬂux of sunspots varies over the 11-year cycle of 10-12 times,
while the large-scale ﬂux - less than 2 times. Moreover, the total magnetic ﬂux
of sunspots equal not more than 11-14% of the total solar magnetic ﬂux (Harvey,

SOLA: solphnew.tex; 5 April 2018; 7:43; p. 12

Comparison of Flaring and non-ﬂaring ARs

1996). In addition, the meridional ﬂow greatly vary over the cycle, and perhaps
are not the cause but the consequence of wave activity.

The simplest scheme suppose that the generated magnetic ﬁeld emerge from
the depth to the surface in the form of tubes. However, modes of active regions
appearance do not look like something that should be as a ﬂoating monolith
tubes. We observe clearly picking up the individual cells of the magnetic ﬁeld to
the general structure (Getling, Ishikawa, and Buchnev, 2015, 2016). Thus one
cannot directly identify the magnetic ﬂux that is generated at great depths, and
the number and size of active regions, although they are of course linked.

At present, already there is a lot of evidence to suggest that there should
be, an additional process that converts the generated at greater depths large
scale magnetic ﬁeld in the ﬁeld of sunspots. This could be distributed dynamo,
subsurface dynamo, small-scale dynamo. There are reasons to believe that in
the convective zone, there are not one but two or even three cells of generations
(Pipin, 2014; Pipin and Kosovichev, 2014, 2015; Du, 2015; Yadav et al., 2015).
Apparently, there are other processes that collect emerged weak ﬁeld on the
surface to strong ﬁelds of active regions (Getling, Ishikawa, and Buchnev, 2015,
2016; Brandenburg, Rogachevskii, and Kleeorin, 2016).

As a result of the presence of two related but diﬀerent processes there are two
important conclusions. Firstly, because of the large number of external parame-
ters diﬃcult to expect a complete coincidence of two cycles. Initial generation of
the magnetic ﬁeld provides a relatively stable 11- year variation. However, the
dependence of the internal activity on the phase of the cycle can vary greatly.
This also applies to the spectral composition of solar activity variations. On the
one hand, you can expect the existence of a rich spectrum of periodicity, the
individual frequencies can appear and disappear at diﬀerent phases of the cycle.
This is what is observed in results of this paper.

Second, it was to be expected that there are two populations of sunspots.
This conclusion is now fully conﬁrmed (Bludova, Obridko, and Badalyan, 2014;
Obridko and Badalyan, 2014; Nagovitsyn et al., 2016). Populations of large and
small groups have diﬀerent statistical properties. The non-ﬂaring active regions
correspond as a rule to the small size of AR and determined by the primary
dynamo mechanism. That is why the hump was observed during the declining
phase of solar cycle 23 (in 2005-2006). This maximum was observed by us earlier,
and its nature is studied in detail in the paper (Obridko et al. (2012), see Fig.1).
By virtue of wealth and temporal instability of the spectrum does not make
sense to discuss the nature of each peak in the spectrum. It can be noted that
the periods are divided into two groups. The ﬁrst group periods around 1 year
undoubtedly associated with large-scale ﬁelds, they seem connected with quasi-
biennial oscillations (QBO). It is known that QBO have a ﬁne structure and
essentially represent a set of pulses with a typical repetition rate of 1 to 3 years.
This whole set periods could not be reﬂected in the observed spectra due to the
short length of realization. They are best expressed in cycle 23, where large-scale
ﬁeld were more powerful.

Periods less than 100 days are clearly visible at 23 and 24 cycles in both types
of groups. They appear better in the period of the cycle maximum. Separately
should be said about the period of 113 days, which is shown only in the more

Kilcik et al.

powerful 23 cycle and only in ﬂaring (that means apparently larger) groups. One
can make a conservative assumption that it is related to the characteristic time
of the existence of large activity complexes 4-5 solar rotations.

Therefore we can suggest that the classical dynamo generates a distributed
large-scale ﬁeld, while the additional dynamic process gives rise to the appear-
ance of active regions. This second process does not end with the formation of
the active region, but is expressed in a variety of relative movements of sunspots
and the emergence of a magnetic ﬂux. Thus, the ﬂare is a natural extension of
the process of formation of the active region. In the active regions where the
second process has stopped, the active regions are formed less eﬀectively and
retain the statistical properties of the large-scale ﬁeld.
