Unconventional electromagnetic properties of the graphene quantum dots

S. E. Shafraniuk
Tegri LLC, Evanston, IL 60202

Quantum dots based on the graphene stripes show unconventional optical properties in the THz
frequency range. The graphene quantum dot (GQD) is made of electrically gated stripe with zigzag
edges. Inside the active region (AR), which is enclosed between the source and drain electrodes, there
are two sharp energy (±)-levels, whose separation 2∆ is controlled with Stark eﬀect by applying the
lateral dc electric ﬁeld. Such the edge states determine the unique nature of elementary excitations,
chiral fermions, that are responsible for the non-linear optical responce revealing a potential for
many applications. They are, e.g., the frequency multiplication and self-focusing of two dimensional
solitons. Furthemore, when injection of the non-equilibrium electrons causes an inverse population
of the levels localized in AR, the subsequent recombination of electrons and holes leads to a coherent
emission of the THz waves.

Unconventional optical properties of graphene in the
THz range with frequencies f = 0.5
100 THz attract
signiﬁcant attention of many researchers [1–7]. Interest
to the THz waves (T-rays) is motivated by variety of po-
tential applications in medicine, information technology,
communication and security. One example of the T-ray
application is the remote sensing of chemical and bio-
logical substances that requires powerful THz lasers and
high-resolution spectral analyzers. There are also sug-
gestions of quatum dot THz detectors [5, 6], frequency
multipliers [11–13] and self-focusing of two dimensional
solitons [14] in the electrically tunable metastructures.
Recently reported [5, 6] carbon nanotube THz receivers
and spectral analyzers exploit the ﬁeld-induced single-
electron tunneling and transitions between the quantized
electron levels. Furthermore, unique plasmonic char-
acteristics of graphene allow building the tunable THz
lasers [7]. The surface plasmons (SP), whose spectrum
changes versus the applied gate voltage have been ob-
served in several experiments [15–25] on graphene.

One remarkable feature of graphene is that the carrier
concentration, the electrochemical potential µ, and hence
its conductivity σ can be appropriately tuned, e.g., by
applying appropriate electric potentials to the gate elec-
trodes [15, 27–29]. Hence, optical properties of the 2D
atomic monolayers are readily tunable in the terahertz
(THz) spectral region [15, 30], enabling their application
in the compact electrically controllable THz optical de-
vices [31]. These opens new opportunities as compared
to the noble metals that are typically used in THz devices
[27]. Hence, the SP spectrum in the 2D atomic monolay-
ers is altered in situ, without any changes in the device’s
design while optical and plasmonic characteristics of the
2D materials are tunable in the terahertz (THz) spectral
region [15, 30].

Currently, there are several concepts of the THz emit-
ters made of the carbon nanotube and graphene [15–18].
A lot of attention is paid to the solid state laser involv-
ing localized quantum states arising in systems with re-
duced dimensionality, e.g., 2D (quantum wells) or 1D
(quantum dots). One example are the quantum cascade

lasers (QCL) based on layered semiconducting superlat-
tices where series of quantum wells with 2D electron spec-
trum are created. A ”proof of concept” tunable THz
laser based on the gain modulation by graphene plas-
mons in an aperiodic lattice and exploiting the unique
properties of graphene plasmons was built and tested
in Ref.
[7]. However, despite their remarkable perfor-
mance, such the quantum cascade lasers (QCL) have se-
rious setbacks. Basic problem is that the energy dissipa-
tion caused by electron-phonon and electron-electron col-
lisions leads to considerable intrinsic Joule heating raising
the internal local temperature far above the temperature
of the external environment. Such the local Joule heat-
ing causes an adverse negative eﬀect on the QCL perfor-
mance. To reduce the negative eﬀect of the local heating,
one should decrease the bias current below some thresh-
old value and also cool down the QCL structure below
200 K. The above measures complicate the QCL design
and limit the QCL system power and eﬃciency. Also
there are several concepts of the THz emitters made of
the carbon nanotube and graphene [15, 16]. A ”proof
of concept” tunable THz laser based on the gain modu-
lation by graphene plasmons in an aperiodic lattice and
exploiting the unique properties of graphene plasmons
was built and tested in Ref.

[7].

A possible fundamental solution to the above issue of
overheating represent systems with lowered dimensional-
ity, e.g., with 1D or even 0D instead of 2D. The elec-
tron bands in the 1D and 0D systems are much nar-
rower than in the 2D systems, which also means that the
phase space where the electron-phonon scattering occurs
is reduced and most of the electron-phonon scattering
processes are eliminated. Hence, in the 1D and 0D sys-
tems, the intrinsic energy dissipation due to suppression
of the electron phonon scattering is considerably lowered
as well. This motivates the interest to electromagnetic
properties of low-dimensional comprising quantum dots.
Promising examples are the novel 2D atomic monolayers
like graphene and its allotropes. The graphene stripes
and carbon nanotubes represent 1D systems, whose di-
mensionality is reduced further to 0D by introducing an

gates. Basically, quantum dot QD lasers are good candi-
dates for the next generation high-speed communication
and already are more promising than quantum well lasers
with respect to important features like threshold current,
temperature stability, chirp, and feedback insensitivity
[8–10]. However, there is a need to understand what lim-
its the performance and how it can be improved. This
requires a better understanding of the underlying dynam-
ics on a microscopic level. Below we study a graphene
quantum dot using microscopic approach for calculating
the optical susceptibility.

In this work we consider an all-electrically controlled
0D quantum dot based on the graphene stripe with zigzag
edges [32] that comprises a plasmonic THz microcavity.

opportunities for designing the tunable THz devices. We
utilize the unique intrinsic properties of graphene that
allow for building various devices with novel remark-
able properties. The study is focused on the ability of
graphene quantum dot (GQD) to dynamically modu-
late round-trip modal gain values and shows potential
to forming the laser emission. Such the gated 2D mono-
layer material serves as a powerful tool to controlling the
optical properties of GQD. The GQD device is instantly
tunable and is all electrical in nature, with minimal elec-
trical power demands.

The goal of this work is to compute the optical suscep-
tibility of the graphene quantum dots (GQD) that de-
scribe their unconventional electromagnetic (EM) prop-
erties. The eﬀorts are focused on the all-electrically con-
trolled GQD fabricated using the graphene stripes with
atomic zigzag edges. The knowledge of how the op-
tical susceptibility of GQD depends on the frequency
and electrochemical potential allows better understand-
ing the physical mechanisms related to the electrically
controlled absorption and emission of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. Furthermore, the computation results allow ﬁnd-
ing, e.g., the conditions to the THz waves emission by the

all-electrically controlled GQD. Furthermore our study
also focuses on ﬁnding the non-linear electromagnetic re-
sponse of GQD. We will see that the physical mechanism
of such the non-linearity originates from the unconven-
tional properties of chiral fermions in graphene stripes
with atomic zigzag edges.

II. SUSCEPTIBILITY OF GRAPHENE

Initially we consider a simplest case of the two-
dimensional (2D) electron gas in the atomic monolayer
representing a suspended pristine graphene. A general
expression for the optical susceptibility of free carriers in
graphene that are chiral fermions (HF) takes the form

I. THE MODEL

±

Geometry of the proposed device is shown in Fig. 1a
where the central part is the graphene stripe, whose prop-
erties are controlled by the source drain and gate elec-
trodes. The active region represents the graphene quan-
tum dot containing two sharp (
)-levels originating from
the edge states and spaced by 2∆. Since the edge states
are topologically protected [36], the (
)-levels are very
sharp and robust, even if the edge roughness and impuri-
ties are present. The magnitude of the level spacing 2∆
is controlled using the Stark eﬀect by setting the elec-
tric voltage between the split gates [37]. Besides, the
energy level positions En in the left (L) and right (R)
side sections of the graphene stripe are controlled by ap-
plying electric potentials VGL,R to the left and right side
bottom gate electrodes respectively. Furthermore, by ap-
plying a ﬁnite bias voltage between the source and drain
electrodes one injects the non-equilibrium electrons into
the upper level with energy E+ = +∆, thereby creat-
ing an inverse population of the upper (+)-level in the
active region. The electrons residing on the upper (+)
level then recombine to the lower (
) level by emitting
THz photons. Hence, the subsequent recombination of
∆ leads to
the electrons into the lower level with E− =
a emission of the T-rays with frequency f = 2∆/h. The
interaction between light and material is controlled by
the shape of the electromagnetic density-of-states (DOS)
in the micro resonator [38, 39]. These mean that the
magnitudes of lasing frequency f and the ampliﬁcation
of resonant modes are set by applying the split-gate volt-
age VSG across the active region of the laser and/or by
the source drain and bottom gate voltages as shown in
Fig. 1. The latter mechanism is studied in details be-
low in Sec. V. We will see that the resonant frequency
of THz emission depends not only on the split gate volt-
age VSG as mentioned above but also it varies versus the
electrochemical potential µ, which is controlled by apply-
ing voltage to the gate electrodes. This enables ﬂexible
all-electric manipulations the lasing emission parameters
[40–42].

An additional control of χ(ω, µ) is introduced with the

the respective local gate voltages control the both, the

III. ZZ STRIPE OF GRAPHENE

For graphene stripes, whose width W is ﬁnite, one
should also consider quantization of the HF excitations in
the lateral direction. Below we compute optical suscep-
tibility of the graphene stripe with atomic zigzag edges.
We use units with ~ = 1 and kB = 1 if not stated oth-
erwise. The edge states [4, 32, 34–37] emerging in the
graphene stripe change the HF excitation spectrum sig-
niﬁcantly. This happens because the chirality of excita-
tions in graphene imposes additional constrains on reﬂec-
tion processes due to conservation of two pseudospins.

Ey = 0, the electron reﬂections at the atomic zigzag
edges [34, 35, 37] cause a crisp narrow energy level to
arise at the energy ǫ = 0. When the transverse electric
= 0, such the zero-energy level experi-
ﬁeld is ﬁnite, Ey 6

that describe the constrain due to the pseudospin con-
servation during elastic reﬂections of the HF excitations
on atomic edges. The electron energy in graphene stripe
(4) depends on the two components of the electron (HF)
momentum, ky (longitudinal) and ky (transversal), which
are related by Eq. (5).
In an inﬁnitely long stripe by
width W , ky is continuous while kx discrete, because the
transversal momentum is quantized.
In the geometry
on Fig. 1a, the active region length La is La >> W ,
therefore the quantization along the y-axis is negligi-
ble. We will see that such the constrain allows reducing
the dimensionality of the system from 2D as in pristine
graphene to 1D for the stripe.
(4), (5), ǫk is
the HF energy variable, µ is the electrochemical poten-
tial, ∆ = eEyW is the Stark splitting of the zero-energy
level posing as the ”energy gap” in Eq.
In such
the case, the splitting energy also depends on the gate
eﬃciency α. Magnitude of µ is controlled by the bot-
tom (or top) gate electrodes, while ∆ is controlled by the
split gate electrodes depicted in Fig. 1a as illustrated by
energy diagram in Fig. 1b. The HF dispersion law is
computed by solving Eqs. (4), (5). The HF excitation
energy ǫ(ky) in the graphene stripe with zigzag edges is
shown in Fig. 2c versus the longitudinal momentum ky.
Technically, the electron density of states shown in Fig.
2d is computed as

Above we have used that the respective change of the HF

ﬁned by Eq. (4). The above Eqs. (5), (11) and (12) serve
as the closed system of transcendental equations allowing

in contrast to pristine graphene, whose the HF density
of states (3) is a smooth function of the energy variable
E, the respective density of states DZZ(ǫ) given by Eq.
(6) for the graphene stripe with zigzag (ZZ) edges shows
dramatically diﬀerent behavior, as illustrated in Fig. 2d.
Namely, owing to appearance of ZZ edge states in the
graphene stripe, the respective singularities in the density

The relevant energy scale in the above formulas (8)-
(14) is determined by the atomic edge geometry and by
the graphene stripe width W . Other energy scales in Eqs.
(8)-(14) are related to ω, ∆, µ and η. Typical magnitudes

of interest here are ω

energy is hf = 4 meV. Then, µ
hf = 4 meV, and
we also use η

which also determines the width of quantized levels local-
ized in the active region depends on coupling of GQD to
the substrate and also by the inelastic collisions, which
also depend on the temperature and GQD geometry.

IV. ELECTROMAGNETIC EMISSION FROM
GQD

ν ≈

ν ≈

A fundamental problem when designing the laser for
the frequency region 0.5-100 THz is that the THz pho-
ton energy ET
ν is relatively low, ET
4 meV - 0.4 eV,
as compared to a visible light photon for which EL
1.8
- 3 eV. Therefore, to ensure a monochromatic THz emis-
sion, the width η of quantized levels localized in the active
region is required to be much narrower than ∆. This
problem is solved by a proper designing the active re-
gion, which is the key element of any solid state laser.
Parameters of the active region must satisfy to a number
of requirements, which have to be observed in order to
get the T-ray emission out of it. In conventional visible
light lasers, η is typically much smaller than the level
spacing between the e/h-levels, i.e., η << ∆. Then, the
photon energy EL
ν is precisely equal to the level spacing
energy ∆, i.e., EL
∆ while the emitted light beam
ν ≡
is fairly monochromatic and coherent. The situation is
diﬀerent in the THz lasers where at the bottom part of
the THz domain the condition η << ∆ might fail if the
level broadening η exceeds ∆, which is relatively small,
∆
4 meV. In the latter case, the spectrum of photon
emission acquires the ﬁnite width (line broadening) while
the photon energy distribution becomes dependent also
on the width η of the electron energy level Eν. Then the
ﬁnite η causes an extra decoherence and broadening the
THz laser emission spectrum. In a worst case scenario
∆, which causes complete violat-
one can even get η
ing of the condition ET
∆. The latter example illus-
trates why creating the THz lasers is so diﬃcult. Other

very narrow electron energy levels in the active region
of the THz laser where η << ∆. Very sharp and narrow

contribute into the level width η. It is accomplished when
using of a narrow stripe having a deﬁnite orientation in
respect to crystallographic directions of the graphene lat-
tice. The lattice symmetry and the atomic edges im-
pose additional selection rules on the scattering prob-
ability involving just phonons with certain polarization
and wave vector on the one hand and electrons with one-
dimensional dispersion law on the other hand. Such the
restriction rules out many inelastic scattering processes
as irrelevant. Furthermore, due to narrow width δ of the
electron bands in GQD, the high-energy phonons with
frequency fph > δ/h do not participate in the electron-
phonon scattering as well. The other mechanism involv-
ing the electron-electron collisions is less signiﬁcant for
graphene in the THz frequency range. The above results

robust in respect to the lattice imperfections and ther-
mal excitations.

Here we consider the limit of high density of the charge
carriers, whose energy recombination time τHF is much
shorter than the change in polarization of the electromag-
netic wave. The polarization relaxes very fast, and is gov-
erned by the carrier–carrier and carrier–phonon scatter-
ing causing the relaxation to its quasi-equilibrium value,
which is determined by the momentary magnitudes of
the ﬁeld and the carrier density. This ensures the sim-
plest quasi-equilibrium conditions of a stationary exci-
tation when the carriers are in equilibrium with them-
selves while the graphene stripe is out of equilibrium. In
the quasi-equilibrium approximation, the ﬁeld intensity
is a slow functions of time. We disregard all the eﬀects
causing deviations from the quasi-equilibrium assump-
tion, such as spectral, spatial, or kinetic hole burning.
This enables using the electron–hole–pair rate equation

V. STEADY STATE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF GQD

Below we consider the eﬀect of the electrochemical po-
tential µ on the optical susceptibility of the graphene
quantum dot (GQD), which is controlled by applying
electric potentials to the back (or top) gate electrodes.
The calculation results for the steady state optical sus-
ceptibility χ (ω) are presented in Figs. 4, 5, 7 and 8.

χ (ω) parts are shown
in Fig. 4 as functions of frequency ω = 2πf for diﬀerent
values of the electrochemical potential µ, whose respec-
tive values are indicated in the ﬁgures. One can see that
the frequency dependence of χ (ω) dramatically changes
as µ varies. Physically, this reﬂects the drastic change
of the GQD optical properties since the magnitude of µ
determines the quantization conditions at the graphene
stripe edges. Remarkably, as µ changes, the signs and
magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts of χ (ω) al-
ter. In Fig. 5, we detalize the instability regions in the
narrower frequency intervals. One can see that in certain
frequency intervals the real part vanishes,
χ (ω) = 0,
while
χ (ω) < 0 remains negative. An important con-
clusion drawn from Figs. 4 and 5 is that there is a set
of resonant frequencies Ωp determined by the condition
χ (ω) < 0. Remarkably, the

Ωp magnitude depends on µ and ∆, so in experments
it can be controlled by applying appropriate electric po-
tentials to the gate electrodes. Hence, based on the data
presented in Figs. 4 and 5, one concludes that lasing con-
ditions are fulﬁlled at 6.93 < ω < 7.03, 6.96 < ω < 7.09
and 7.14 < ω < 7.22 (in units of ∆). However, when

due to the inelastic scattering is two orders of magnitude
lower than for conventional electrons with continuous dis-

excitations interact with phonons very weakly, because
the respective phase space is conﬁned. Therefore, the ac-

When designing the graphene THz lasers, there are
other potential issues as follows. (a) Pumping of non-
equilibrium electron and hole excitations into the active
region of the THz laser causes not only inverse popula-
tion of the e/h-levels. An adverse side eﬀect is that the
non-equilibrium electrons and holes eventually transfer
their excessive energy to the lattice oscillations and to
other excitations in the system. This leads to an over-
all heating of the active region during the induced emis-
sion process. Excessive Joule heating of the active region
might change its properties and can even adversely im-
pact the overall performance of the THz laser. There-
fore, one should pay attention to reducing the unwanted
heating. The adverse heating can be diminished by im-
plementing the active region with an appropriate geom-

this way one eliminates certain electron-phonon scat-
tering processes, e.g., by using a stripe-shaped active
region with zigzag edges. Similarly, one excludes the
indirect inter-level transitions which cause the acoustic
phonon emission. The remaining contribution originates
solely from the direct inter-level electron-hole recombina-
tion processes providing emission the THz photons out
the active region. (b) Forming an optimal energy spec-
trum inside the active region. An increased width of the
electron energy levels restricts the device performance,
widens overall frequency interval and causes line broad-
ening of the generated T-beam. One solution is to de-
signing an active region with narrow (η << ∆) quan-
tized energy levels.
It can be accomplished by placing
the appropriate split gates right on the top of graphene
sheet (see Fig. 2a). An example of the energy diagram of
the gate/open graphene region boundary is sketched in
Fig. 2b). The electric potential penetrates from the gate
region into the open graphene on the Debay screening
length 0.5-2 nm, depending on the temperature and the
charge carrier concentration. Figs. 2c,d show the electron
subband structure and the local electron density of states
in the active region respectively. (c) A distinguished fea-
ture of graphene is anisotropy of the microscopic trans-
port. Therefore one should design the active region with

major THz laser parameters can be well deﬁned during
the fabrication process.

There are several reasons why the graphene THz lasers
have a remarkable potential as compared to their con-
ventional semiconducting counterparts. (i) The intrin-
sic coherence in graphene is preserved far better than
in other non-superconducting electronic materials.
It
happens due to so-called pseudospin conservation which
is an intrinsic feature of graphene.
In particular, the
good intrinsic coherence helps to reducing the intrinsic
noises. (ii) The energy relaxation in graphene is typically
much slower than in other conductors. It allows achiev-
ing a considerable degree the inverse level population.
(iii) Technically, the energy dependence of the election
density of states in the 2D graphene enables manipulating
of their properties by mere applying electric potentials
to the gate electrodes. Furthermore, the 2D geometry is
well suitable to fabricating the bottom, top and side gate

VI. NON-LINEAR ELECTROMAGNETIC
PROPERTIES OF GQD

The unconventional excitation spectrum of the chi-
ral fermions in the graphene stripe results in non-linear
electromagnetic properties of this the two-dimensional
atomic monolayer material. In particular, graphene has

 
 
10

remarkable non-linear properties in the terahertz (THz)
frequency range. These create many suggestions for novel
photonic devices, such as THz devices [44], optical mod-
ulators [45], photodetectors [46] and polarizers [47]. One
promising direction is exploiting the non-linear electro-
magnetic response of the graphene stripe to an ac elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. Such the nonlinear eﬀect might be
used for the frequency multiplication or for self-focusing
of two dimensional Townes-like solitons in the electrically
tunable metastructure shown in Fig.1. Doping graphene
by applying the electric potentials to the gate electrodes
allows ﬁne-tuning the nonlinear properties of such the
metastructure. Total internal reﬂection at the bound-
aries of the dielectric waveguide causes the conﬁnement
of the E-ﬁeld along the lateral x-direction. As the y-
coordinate is varied along the stripe axis, the normal-
ized E-ﬁeld cross-section along the x-direction changes.
Such the change, which is larger than in planar nonlinear
waveguides corresponds to a signiﬁcant nonlinear optical
current supported by the 2D graphene stripe. Below we
ﬁnd that the third-order susceptibility in the graphene
stripe is large enabling to form the TE and TM spatial
optical solitons. Stable Townes-like spatial solitary waves
propagating in the longitudinal direction originate from
the intraband current dominating the electron dynamics
for THz excitations of doped graphene. Signiﬁcant mag-
nitudes of the nonlinear optical susceptibilities in the 2D
graphene sheets were theoretically predicted in Refs. [11],
[12]. They have been experimentally observed for third-
order nonlinear eﬀects by authors of Ref. [13].

A nonlinear eﬀect utilized to controlling light propa-
gation at the micro- and nano-scales is the formation of
temporal and spatial EM-solitons [14]. We analyze the
respective non-linear contribution for the graphene strip
in the geometry shown in Fig. 1. Consider a classical

According to Eq. (30), the non-linear eﬀect becomes es-

ship (30) is that the energy, gained by electrons from
the ac ﬁeld during the oscillation period should be large
as compared to their average equilibrium energy. In the
low-ﬁeld limit, the response is linear (i.e., the j(t) depen-
dence has a sinusoidal form), while at strong ﬁelds the
time dependence of the current tends to that given by Eq.
(25). The strong-ﬁeld condition (30) can be rewritten as

which means that the required ac electric ﬁeld grows lin-
early with the electromagnetic wave frequency and with
the square root of the electron density.

There are following limitations on applicability of the
quasi-classical method to describing the electromagnetic
response of graphene stripe. Physically, using the New-
ton equation (22), one takes into account contribution
the intra-band transitions to the ac electric current while
ignoring the inter-band transitions between the lower
quasi-hole and the upper quasi-electron bands. This is

vide just a simplest insight how the optical susceptibility
χ′′ (ω, t) evolves in response to a pulse of injection cur-
rent incurring a sharp change of the eﬀective electron
temperature T ∗ of GQD. Let us assume that the pulse
of injection current heats GQD, whose eﬀective temper-
ature increases up to T ∗. Basically, after the pulse ends,
the time evolution of the HF distribution function f (ǫ, t)
is found as a solution of Boltzmann equation. For the
sake of simplicity, we use the eﬀective temperature ap-
proximation that gives

simple model (35) and (36) allowing to determine the be-
havior of the graphene “particle” from the time that the
injection current pulse ends (t =0 ps) till reaching steady
state at t =2 ps. The graph in Fig. 10 helps to under-

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

Obtained results suggest that the considered design
of the graphene quantum dot (GQD) allows the all-
electrical control of the optical susceptibility χ(ω, µ).
This becomes possible because the magnitude and sign
of both the real and imaginary parts of χ(ω, µ) depend
on the electrochemical potential µ and on the frequency
variable ω. Technically, in the GQD structure one can
change the magnitudes of ∆ and µ by applying appro-
priate electric potentials to the local gates as depicted in
Fig. 1, thereby enabling the ﬂexible control of the GQD
optical properties.

Furthermore, likewise the pristine graphene, the GQD
structure has remarkable non-linear electromagnetic
properties stemming from the unconventional dispersion
law of the chiral fermions in the graphene stripe with
zigzag edges. A strong non-linear eﬀect arises because
the optical susceptibility depends on the ac ﬁeld inten-
sity. The magnitude of high-order harmonics is signiﬁ-
cant even in relatively weak ac ﬁelds, causing appearance
of variety the non-linear eﬀects.

In experiments, the THz radiation is detected in sev-
eral ways. For instance, one can form a Josephson junc-
tion in an adjacent area on the same substrate, which
will serve as a THz detector. Another option is to de-
posit GQD THz detector on the same substrate next to
the GQD THz emitter. Furthermore, one can use metal-
lic co-planar strip lines as THz antennas to detect the
T-rays. Special attention must be paid to creating of
the sharp and narrow electron quantized levels formed
between two timber-like multilayered gate electrodes de-
posited along the ZZ-direction. Such the energy levels are
robust in presence of lattice defects and imperfections
remaining to be very narrow and sharp since they are
topologically protected [4, 32, 36]. In the active region
of the THz emitter, the coherent monochromatic THz
waves originate from the quantum transitions between
the sharp localized levels. The energy level splitting is
readily controlled by the voltage diﬀerence between the
gate electrodes having a multilayered structure as de-
picted in Fig. 1.

The unconventional electromagnetic (EM) properties
of the graphene quantum dots (GQD) have a promis-
ing potential for practical applications. Experimentally,

 
it would be interesting to fabricating the all-electrically
controlled GQD based on the graphene stripes with
atomic zigzag edges. The calculation results of the opti-
cal susceptibility indicate strong dependence on the fre-
quency and electrochemical potential, which can be ex-
ploited for experimental observing the tunable THz emis-
sion. Another result is the non-linear electromagnetic

response of GQD, whose mechanism is related to the
unconventional properties of chiral fermions in graphene
stripes with atomic zigzag edges. The obtained data al-
low better understanding the physical mechanisms re-
lated to the electrically controlled GQD showing remark-
able electromagnetic properties.

A. Susceptibility of pristine graphene

Here we provide technical details concerning the op-
tical susceptibilty of pristine graphene. We use Eq. (1),
which is written for indirect interband transitions accom-
panied by the absorption/emission of a phonon with the
= 0. Here we use units with ~ = 1
ﬁnite momentum q
and kB = 1 if not stated otherwise. When the absorp-
tion/emission process is accompanied by the photon in-
stead of the phonon, the interband transitions become
direct and the above Eq. (1) is simpliﬁed. For the pho-
tons, whose absorption creates the electron-like HF (be-
low for brevity we call them electrons) in the conductive
band while the hole-like HF (we call them holes) in the
valence band (direct interband transitions), we set q = 0.
Then, using that ss′ =
1 we get the respective energy

In more realistic conditions, e.g., when the temperature
is ﬁnite while the graphene sheet is deposited on a sub-
strate and its electronic states are controlled by gate elec-
trodes, one ﬁnds the optical susceptibility numerically,

as described in the main text. Likewise, numeric solu-
tions also used for studying the non-stationary and non-
equilibrium properties of the graphene samples.
