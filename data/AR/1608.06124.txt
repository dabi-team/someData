Transient single-particle spectral function of BaFe2As2, a parent compound of iron-based superconductors,
has been studied by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an extreme-ultraviolet laser
generated by higher harmonics from Ar gas, which enables us to investigate the dynamics in the entire Brillouin
zone. We observed electronic modiﬁcations from the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordered state within ∼ 1 ps
after the arrival of a 1.5 eV pump pulse. We observed optically excited electrons at the zone center above EF at
0.12 ps, and their rapid decay. After the fast decay of the optically excited electrons, a thermalized state appears
and survives for a relatively long time. From the comparison with the density-functional theory band structure
for the paramagnetic and SDW states, we interpret the experimental observations as the melting of the SDW.
Exponential decay constants for the thermalized state to recover back to the SDW ground state are ∼ 0.60 ps
both around the zone center and the zone corner.

Ultrafast phenomena in condensed matter have been the
subject of intense research. In order to investigate nonequilib-
rium transient states in solids, the pulsed photons are divided
into pump and probe portions: the pump pulses excite the sys-
tem and the probe pulses measure various physical quantities
of the transient states after variable delay times. On the other
hand, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
is a versatile tool to study the electronic structure of solids
with momentum resolution. Combining these strengths, time-
and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES)
was realized shortly after the advent of laser-based ARPES.
TrARPES technique has been utilized to study ultrafast dy-
namics of various materials including charge-density-wave
materials [1, 2], cuprate superconductors [3], graphene [4, 5],
and topological insulators [6, 7].
The ultrafast dynamics of

iron-based superconductors
(FeSCs) has also been the focus of intense research. In par-
ticular, coherent A1g phonon oscillations of the As atoms
have been observed by various pump-probe experiments.
Mansart et al. [8] reported oscillatory components overlaid
on exponential decay in the transient reﬂectivity spectra of
Ba(Fe0.92Co0.08)2As2. TrARPES studies on Ba/EuFe2As2
[9, 10] found oscillations of the chemical potential of the elec-
trons after the pump pulse. Time-resolved x-ray diffraction
experiments [11, 12] measured the oscillations in the inten-
sity of the Bragg reﬂections from BaFe2As2 (Ba122). A nat-
ural question is how the electronic system is modiﬁed con-
comitantly with the lattice. Since the temperature scale of the
pump beam (1.5 eV ∼ 17400 K) is much higher than TN, it
may drive the electronic system to undergo a phase transi-
tion to the paramagnetic (PM) state. In equilibrium, the re-
construction of the band structure across the SDW transition
has been clearly observed by ARPES by changing temper-
ature [13]. Therefore, one expects that the phase transition

can be induced by optical pumping and the relaxation to the
SDW ground state is detectable by TrARPES. Furthermore,
since investigations into SDW materials by TrARPES have
been limited, TrARPES studies on Ba122 will give us insight
into the dynamics of SDW formation in general.

Conventional TrARPES typically utilizes 6-7 eV laser
achieved by wavelength conversion. For the FeSCs, however,
the information about electron pockets around the X point
cannot be obtained. To overcome this hurdle, we have em-
ployed higher harmonic generation (HHG) by focusing fun-
damental light to a cell ﬁlled with rare gas [14]. This method
can create photons in the extreme ultraviolet regime (hν > 20
eV), which are high enough to probe the entire Brillouin zone
(BZ) of FeSCs. A previous work by Yang et al. [15] utilized a
similar setup and observed a global oscillation of the chemical
potential due to the A1g phonon mode of As atoms both at the
Γ and X points. However, the time-resolved data in that work
were limited to the evolution of angle-integrated photoemis-
sion intensity.

In the present work, we have performed TrARPES mea-
surements of Ba122 in the SDW state in order to directly mea-
sure transient single-particle spectral functions both around
the zone center and zone corner. The fundamental laser sys-
tem is a 1 kHz Ti:Sapphire laser operating at wavelengths (λ )
of 800 nm with a pulse width of 90 fs. The second harmon-
ics with λ = 400 nm generated by a 0.5-mm-thick β -BaB2O4
crystal are employed as the source of HHG. Higher harmonics
(HHs) were generated by irradiating the second harmonics to a
cell ﬁlled with Ar gas and the 9th harmonics with hν = 28 eV
were selected by a pair of SiC/Mg multilayer mirrors by sup-
pressing other HHs [16]. Ba122 Single crystals were not de-
twinned and, therefore, the ARPES intensity is the superposi-
tion of intensities from two inequivalent domains in the SDW
state. The kinetic energies and the momenta of photoelectrons

 
 
 
 
 
 
were measured using a Scienta R4000 hemispherical electron
energy analyzer. The total energy resolution was 250 meV. All
the measurements were done at 10 K, which was well below
the TN of the equilibrium SDW transition. The ﬁrst BZs for
the PM and antiferromagnetic (AFM) states are shown in Fig.
1 (c). For simplicity, we shall use the notation of the PM BZ
to specify positions in the momentum space. In-plane (kX , kY )
and out-of-plane (kz) momenta are expressed in units of π/a
and 2π/c, respectively, where a = 3.97 ˚A and c = 13.00 ˚A are
the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice constants, respectively.

photoemission intensity around the (0, 0, 6.5) point of the Brillouin
zone (BZ). (b) Difference spectra of (a) from the average intensity
before the arrival of pump pulse. (c) First BZs of the paramagnetic
(black) and antiferromagnetic (red) states. We shall use the para-
magnetic notation below. Solid and dotted arrows indicate the mo-
mentum cuts for the (0, 0, 6.5) and (1, 1, 6.1) points, respectively. (d)
Temporal evolution of the electronic temperature (Te). Te is evalu-
ated by ﬁtting the photoemission intensity to the Fermi-Dirac dis-
tribution function convoluted with the instrumental gaussian func-
tion. Black dotted line shows the ﬁt to a decay function of the form
Te(t) = A + BΘ(t) exp(−t/τdecay), where Θ(t) is the Heaviside step
function.

Figure 1 (a) shows the temporal evolution of angle-
integrated photoemission (PES) spectra around the zone cen-
ter. With hν = 28 eV probe photons the momentum cut is on
the kz = 6.5(2π/c) plane as shown by a solid arrow in Fig.
1 (c). One observes that upon the arrival of a pump pulse
at t = 0, the electron population above the Fermi level (EF )
suddenly increases and it decays afterwards. To improve the
visibility of the data, we show the difference spectra in Fig.
1 (b). Here, the spectrum average before t = 0 has been sub-
tracted. It is clear that just after t = 0 the population above EF
increases while that below EF decreases, and that this pop-
ulation modiﬁcation decreases with delay time. In order to
quantify the transient state, we show in Fig. 1 (d) the elec-

2

tronic temperature Te as a function of delay time. Te was de-
termined by ﬁtting the PES intensity at each delay time to a
Fermi-Dirac distribution function convoluted with a Gaussian
with the instrumental resolution of 250 meV. After the pump
pulse, Te reaches ∼ 1400 K. Te was ﬁtted to a decay function
of the form Te(t) = A + BΘ(t) exp(−t/τdecay), where Θ(t) is
the Heaviside step function. The best ﬁt is shown by a dot-
ted curve. We obtained a decay constant of τdecay = 0.58 ps
around the (0,0,6.5) point.

In order to study the momentum-resolved spectral function
during the relaxation, we show in Fig. 2 (a) the TrARPES
spectra taken at different delay times. The momentum cut
is the same as that of Fig. 1. To highlight the change of
the spectra, we also show the difference TrARPES spectra in
Fig. 2 (b). Here, the spectrum at -0.47 ps has been subtracted
from each spectrum. Before the pump arrival (-0.47 ps), the
spectrum should represent that of the SDW state, although the
identiﬁcation is not obvious under the present experimental
resolution. We later argue that the spectrum represents that of
the SDW state. After the arrival of pump pulse (t ≥ −0.02
ps), electrons start to occupy states above EF . At 0.12 ps,
high-energy states are populated above the gap (E − EF > 0.6
eV) and the states have parabolic, electron-band-like intensity
distribution. At 0.41 ps, this population disappears, indicating
the fast decay of electrons in the high energy state. As for the
intensity between 0 < E − EF < 0.4 eV, it already exists at -
0.02 ps, reaches maximum around 0.12 ps, and slowly decays
as a function of time. At 1.42 ps, there is almost no separa-
tion of positive and negative area in the difference spectrum,
indicating that the electronic system has relaxed back to the
equilibrium state.

Here we discuss the implications of the present data for an
ultrafast phase transition. In the following, we argue that the
observed hot electron states are those of the PM states caused
by the melting of the SDW state. We compare in Figs. 3
(a) and (b) the difference spectrum at 0.12 ps with density-
functional theory (DFT) band structure at kz = 6.5 (2π/c) in
the PM state calculated within the generalized gradient ap-
proximation (GGA) [17]. The intensity increase is shown by
red in the difference spectrum in Fig. 3 (a). We can con-
ﬁrm high-energy population above 0.6 eV and a gap between
0.4 < E − EF < 0.6 eV. This is qualitatively consistent with
the calculated PM band structure shown in Fig. 3 (b), and
quantitatively the smaller gap in experiment can be ascribed
either to the renormalization of the band structure or to the
experimental resolution. We also show the DFT band struc-
tures for the SDW state in Fig. 3 (c). Since the Ba122 samples
were not detwinned, we show the results for two inequivalent
domains. One observes that the band structure near EF in the
SDW state is more entangled than that in the PM state, due
to the band folding caused by the AFM ordering. In particu-
lar, the band bottoms of domain 1 at 0.3 eV and the ﬂat band
at 0.6 eV of domain 2 are not clearly resolved in the present
measurement. From these comparisons, the electronic states
at 0.12 ps can be identiﬁed as that of the PM state, as expected
from the high Te > 1000 K after the optical pump.

(b) Difference

To gain further insight from the intensity decrease shown
in blue, equilibrium spectra taken with hν = 63 eV (Z point)
for the SDW (20K) and PM (150 K) states are shown in Figs.
3 (d) and (e), respectively. We note that the blue intensity in
panel (a) shows a parabolic, electron-band-like feature. We
ascribe this to a parabolic feature observed in the equilibrium
the SDW state as indicated by a black dotted line in Fig. 3
(e), which does not appear in the PM state [Fig. 3 (d)]. This
feature originates from the electron band bottom located at the
zone corner in the PM state. The disappearance of this feature
by raising the temperature from the SDW state to the PM state
is also reported in Ref. 13. Thus the data at -0.47 ps can be
naturally assigned to those of the SDW state, as expected from
the sample temperature of 10 K < TN.

Next we investigate the dynamics of excited electrons
around the zone corner. Figure 4 (a) shows the temporal evo-
lution of angle-integrated PES spectra at the (1,1,6.1) point.
We employed hν = 28 eV and the momentum cut in the BZ
is indicated by a dotted arrow in Fig. 1 (c). The difference
spectra are also shown in Fig. 4 (b). As in the case of the
(0,0,6.5) point, the intensity above EF increases and that be-
low EF decreases at t = 0, and this change weakens with time.
The evolution of Te is plotted in Fig. 4 (c). Te rises up to ∼
900 K just after the pump pulse. We obtain a decay constant
of 0.60 ps, close to 0.58 ps around the (0,0,6.5) point.

TrARPES spectra around the (1,1,6.1) point are shown in
Fig. 5 (a) and the difference spectra are shown in Fig. 5
(b). Although the modiﬁcations in the spectra are weaker than
those in the zone center, we observed an intensity increase af-
ter the pump pulse. Note that we did not observe high-energy
population well above EF within our measurement range. To
understand the difference between the results for the (0,0,6.5)
and (1,1,6.1) points, we show the calculated PM band struc-
ture in Fig. 5 (c). One of the two bands located around ∼ 1 eV
above EF is holelike and ﬂat; as a result, the lifetime of excited

electrons around the (1,1,6.1) point can be much shorter than
around that at (0,0,6.5), because they can easily decay into dif-
ferent momentum states via electron-phonon and/or electron-
electron interactions. To support the interpretation, we also
show the calculated SDW band structure for two domains in
Fig. 5 (d). As in the (0,0,6.5) point, there are more bands in
the SDW state than in the PM state. In particular, there are
three electron band bottoms between 0.2 < E − EF < 0.6 eV,
where long excitation lifetime is expected. The absence of the

4

more consistent with the band structure calculation of the PM
state than that of the SDW state, which is expected from the
high Te above 1000 K. After the fast decay of the optically ex-
cited electrons, a thermalized state appears and survives for a
relatively long time. Decay constants both around the Γ point
and the X point are ∼ 0.60 ps, in agreement with previous
TrARPES and time-resolved reﬂectivity measurements.

observation of transient population in this energy range cor-
roborates our assignment of the transient states between 0.1
and 0.2 ps to the PM state.

While the high-energy electrons above 0.6 eV around
(0, 0, 6.5) point decay quickly (< 0.41 ps), the hot electrons
close to EF persist for a longer time, which can be interpreted
as the thermalized electronic states. For the time scale of
the relaxation of near-EF states, we compare the present de-
cay constants with those from previous works. The present
value ∼ 0.60 ps for 10 K is close to 0.8 ps for EuFe2As2 [9],
0.38 ps for Ba122 [15] . Also, it is comparable with 0.6-0.8
ps for superconducting Ba1−xKxFe2As2 [18] estimated from
time-resolved reﬂectivity. As for the A1g phonon mode, we
did not observe any oscillatory intensity modulation near EF .
Mansart et al. [8] found that, while the phonon oscillation is
barely visible at ∼ 1.3 mJ/cm2 in the course of the exponential
decay of the reﬂectivity, it becomes more prominent at higher
ﬂux (∼ 2 mJ/cm2) and makes the relaxation slower. The ab-
sence of oscillations may suggest that our data represents the
electronic state in weakly pumped regime. Other possibilities
include the polarization and the width of the pump pulse. We
need further investigation into the dependence of the transient
states on ﬂuence, polarization and pump width in the future.

In conclusion, we have studied the ultrafast dynamics of
the BaFe2As2 in the SDW state by TrARPES using a HH from
rare gas. We observed electronic modiﬁcations from the SDW
band structure within ∼ 1 ps after the 1.5 eV pump pulse.
High-energy states above EF were observed at 0.12 ps at the
zone center and they decay rapidly. The 0.12 ps spectrum is
