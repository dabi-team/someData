Recent
NA61/SHINE

results from the strong interactions program of

Abstract. The NA61/SHINE experiment studies hadron production in hadron+hadron,
hadron+nucleus and nucleus+nucleus collisions. The strong interactions program has
two main purposes: study the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement and search for the
signatures of the critical point of strongly interacting matter. This aim is pursued by per-
forming a two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram by varying the energy/momentum
(13A-158A GeV/c) and the system size (p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La) of the collisions.
This publication reviews recent results from p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc interactions. Mea-
sured particle spectra are discussed and compared to NA49 results from Pb+Pb collisions.
The results illustrate the progress towards scanning the phase diagram of strongly inter-
acting matter.

1 The NA61/SHINE facility

The layout of the NA61/SHINE detector [1] is presented in Fig. 1. It consists of a large acceptance
hadron spectrometer with excellent capabilities in charged particle momentum measurements and
identiﬁcation by a set of ﬁve Time Projection Chambers as well as Time-of-Flight detectors. The high
resolution forward calorimeter, the Projectile Spectator Detector, measures energy ﬂow around the
beam direction, which in nucleus-nucleus reactions is primarily a measure of the number of spectator
(non-interacted) nucleons and is thus related to the centrality of the collision. An array of beam
detectors identiﬁes beam particles and measures precisely their trajectories. Primary and secondary
hadron as well as ion beams are used by the experiment.

2 Particle ratios in inelastic p+p collisions and inverse slope parameter T

The excellent particle identiﬁcation based on the Time-oﬀ-Flight (ToF) and energy loss (dE/dx) mea-
surements allows to calculate the ratio of yields K+/π+. The energy dependence of the K+/π+ ra-
tio at midrapidity for inelastic p+p interactions and central Pb+Pb/Au+Au collisions is presented in
Fig. 2 (left). The NA61/SHINE data suggest that even in inelastic p+p interactions the energy de-
pendence of the K+/π+ ratio exhibits rapid changes in the SPS energy range. However, the horn
structure [2] observed in central Pb+Pb collisions is reduced to a step. Data obtained beyond the SPS
energy range, namely at RHIC and LHC [3–7], continue the trend seen at the SPS.

p+p collision. The NA61/SHINE results from inelastic p+p collisions exhibit rapid changes like those
observed in central Pb+Pb interactions. World data for p+p and Pb+Pb/Au+Au reactions are plotted
for a comparison and were taken from Refs. [6, 8–10].

The dependence of the mean pion multiplicity divided by the mean number of wounded nucleons
(participants) as function of collision energy, the so called kink plot, is shown for inelastic p+p, Ar+Sc
and A+A interactions in Fig. 3. The pion multiplicity (cid:104)π(cid:105) in the SPS energy range increases faster
in central Pb+Pb than in p+p collisions. The two dependencies cross at about 40A GeV/c. For high
SPS energies results from Ar+Sc reactions follow the Pb+Pb trend while for low SPS energies Ar+Sc
follows the p+p tendency. The situation is opposite for Be+Be collisions.

Spectra of transverse mass mT − m0 of π− mesons in Ar+Sc are shown and compared to measure-
ments for p+p, Be+Be, and Pb+Pb collisions in Fig. 4. Spectra in p+p reactions are exponential. A
concave shape is observed in Pb+Pb, Ar+Sc and Be+Be collisions. The shape diﬀerence between
p+p and A+A reactions is attributed to transverse collective ﬂow in A+A.

3 Λ spectra in p+p interactions

The transverse momentum distributions of Λ hyperons shown in Fig. 5 (left) are for inelastic p+p col-
lisions at a beam momentum of 40 GeV/c. The yields are corrected for acceptance and for losses due
to the topological and track selection cuts. Integration and extrapolation of the transverse momentum
distributions provide the data points for the distributions of rapidity dn/dy and the Feynman variable
dn/dxF. The Feynman variable distribution of Λ hyperons produced in inelastic p+p reactions at
40 GeV/c is shown in Fig.5 (right).

The Λ cross-section produced in inelastic p+p interactions at 40 GeV is presented in Fig. 5 (left).
Results are shown as function of transverse momentum in rapidity intervals. Fig. 5 (right) depicts the
dependence of the Λ production cross-section as function of xF together with the extrapolation line
for determining the total yield.

Extrapolation of the xF distributions into the unmeasured region provides estimates of the Λ yields.
The corresponding multiplicities (average yields per event) are compared to world data in Fig. 6 (left)
sNN. The NA61 data follow the trend set by the world data and
as function of center-of-mass energy
at the same time reduce the uncertainties of the yields signiﬁcantly at the two energies analysed by
sNN = 19 GeV the experimental data have large errors and lie consistently below the
NA61. Above
EPOS model calculation. It is desirable to obtain new experimental data in this energy range. Below
10 GeV EPOS seems to overpredict Λ yields. However, this model is not meant to provide reliable
results at this energy and below. The ratio (cid:104)Λ(cid:105) / (cid:104)π(cid:105) is shown in Fig. 6 (right) as function of
sNN.
The presented NA61/SHINE results agree with the world data. Measurements in A+A collisions at
the AGS and by NA49 show a diﬀerent behaviour than that observed in p+p reactions.
