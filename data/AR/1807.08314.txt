In this review, we have studied the quasielastic production cross sections and polarization compo-
nents of Λ, Σ0 and Σ− hyperons induced by the weak charged currents in the antineutrino reactions
on the nucleon and the nuclear targets like 12C, 16O, 40Ar and 208Pb. It is shown that the energy
and the Q2 dependence of the cross sections and the various polarization components can be ef-
fectively used to determine the axial vector transition form factors in the strangeness sector and
test the validity of various symmetry properties of the weak hadronic currents like G-invariance,
T-invariance and SU(3) symmetry. In particular, the energy and the Q2 dependence of the polar-
ization components of the hyperons is found to be sensitive enough to determine the presence of the
second class current with or without T-invariance.

These hyperons decay dominantly into pions giving an additional contribution to the weak pion
production induced by the antineutrinos. This contribution is shown to be quantitatively signiﬁcant
as compared to the pion production by the ∆ excitation in the nuclear targets in the sub-GeV
energy region relevant for the ¯νµ cross section measurements in the oscillation experiments. We
have also included a few new results, based on our earlier works, which are in the kinematic region
of the present and future (anti)neutrino experiments being done with the accelerator (anti)neutrinos
at T2K, MicroBooNE, MiniBooNE, NOνA, MINERνA and DUNE, as well as for the atmospheric
(anti)neutrino experiments in this energy region.

INTRODUCTION

A simultaneous knowledge of the neutrino and antineutrino cross sections in the same energy region for the nuclear
targets is highly desirable in order to understand the systematics relevant for the analyses of various neutrino oscillation
experiments being done in search of CP violation in the leptonic sector and in the determination of neutrino mass
hierarchy [1–7]. Experimentally there are many results available in the cross section measurements for the various
weak processes induced by the neutrinos in nuclei in the sub-GeV and few-GeV energy region [8–11]. There are very
few measurements reported for the processes induced by the antineutrinos in the same energy region specially around
1 GeV [8, 12]. Theoretically, however, there exists quite a few calculations for the antineutrino-nucleus cross
E¯νµ ≈
sections and some of them have been incorporated in most of the neutrino event generators like GENIE [13], NEUT [14],
1.2 GeV, the most important processes
NuWro [15] and GiBUU [16]. In this energy region of antineutrinos, E¯νµ ≈
contributing to the nuclear cross sections are the quasielastic (QE) scattering and the inelastic scattering where
the excitation of ∆ resonance is the dominant process contributing to the single pion production (CC1π). There
is some contribution from the excitation of higher resonances and very little contribution from the deep inelastic
scattering (DIS) [17–21].

It is well known that the cross sections for the various weak processes induced by the neutrinos and antineutrinos
diﬀer by the sign of the interference terms between the vector and the axial vector currents making the antineutrino
cross sections smaller and fall faster with Q2 as compared to the neutrino cross sections [22–27]. There is another
diﬀerence between the neutrino and antineutrino induced processes on the nucleon and the nuclear targets which
has not been adequately emphasized in the context of the discussion of the systematics in the neutrino oscillation
experiments. This diﬀerence arises due to the phenomenological ∆S = ∆Q rule implicit in the standard model
(SM) in the charged current sector which allows the quasielastic production of hyperons on nucleons induced by the

antineutrinos, i.e. ¯νl + N
The hyperon production process is Cabibbo suppressed and its cross section is generally small as compared to the
quasielastic or ∆ production in the ∆S = 0 sector. However, in the lower energy region of the antineutrinos i.e.
E¯νµ << 1 GeV where the production of ∆ resonance is kinematically inhibited due to a higher threshold for the ∆
production as compared to Λ production, the hyperon production cross section may not be too small. These hyperons

dominantly decay into π− and πo and give additional contribution to the pion production induced by the antineutrinos
from the nucleon and the nuclear targets.

Since π− and πo are the largest misidentiﬁed background for the ¯νµ disappearance and ¯νe appearance channels in the
present neutrino oscillation experiments with the antineutrino beams, the hyperon production becomes an important
process to be considered in the accelerator experiments specially at T2K [8], MicroBooNE [9], MiniBooNE [10, 12]
and NOνA [28], where the antineutrino energies are in the sub-GeV energy region. Moreover, these experiments are
being done using nuclear targets like 12C, 16O, 40Ar, etc., where the pion production cross sections through the ∆
excitations are considerably suppressed due to the nuclear medium eﬀect (NME) and the ﬁnal state interaction (FSI)
eﬀect [17, 18]. On the other hand, the pions arising from the hyperons are expected to be less aﬀected by these eﬀects
due to the fact that the hyperon decay widths are highly suppressed in the nuclear medium making them live longer
and travel through most of the nuclear medium before they decay [29, 30]. Therefore, the two eﬀects discussed above
i.e. the lower threshold energy of the hyperon production and near absence of the FSI for the pions coming from the
hyperon decay compensate for the tan2 θc suppression as compared to the pions coming from the ∆ production. This
makes these processes important in the context of oscillation experiments with antineutrino beams in the sub-GeV
energy region.

Notwithstanding the importance of the hyperon production in the context of present day oscillation experiments
with the accelerator antineutrino beams at lower energies, the study of these processes is important in their own
right as these processes give us an opportunity to understand the weak interactions at higher energies in the ∆S = 1
sector through the study of the nucleon-hyperon transition form factors at higher energy and Q2. The information
about these form factors is obtained through the analysis of semileptonic hyperon decays which is limited to very low
Q2 [31–33]. It is for this reason that the work in the quasielastic production of hyperons induced by the antineutrino
was started more than 50 years back and many theoretical papers have reported results for the cross section and the
polarization of the hyperons in the literature [34–55] which have been summarized in the early works of Marshak
et al. [56], Llewellyn Smith [57] and Pais [58]. Experimentally, however, there are very few attempts made where
the quasielastic production of Λ, Σ0, Σ− have been studied, like at CERN [59–61], BNL [62], FNAL [63, 64] and
SKAT [65]. A summary of all the experimental results on the energy dependence of the total cross sections on the
hyperon production and its comparison with the theoretical calculations has been given by Kuzmin and Naumov [66]
and Raﬁ Alam et al. [67]. With the availability of the high intensity antineutrino beams at JPARC [68] and FNAL [69]
and the advances made in the detector technology, the feasibility of studying the quasielastic production of hyperons
and their polarizations have been explored in many theoretical calculations [66, 70–86]. Experimentally, while the
MINERνA [87] collaboration has included the study of quasielastic production of hyperons in its future plans, some
other collaborations are also considering the feasibility of making such measurements [88].

In this review, we have attempted to give an overview of the present and the earlier works done in the study of the
quasielastic production of hyperons induced by the antineutrinos from the nucleon [80] and the nuclear targets [82]
and its implications for the pion production [50, 67] relevant for the analysis of the oscillation experiments being
done with the antineutrino beams in the sub-GeV energy region. Speciﬁcally, we describe the energy and the Q2
dependence of the production cross section and polarizations of Λ, Σ0 and Σ− hyperons in the quasielastic reactions
on the nucleon and the nuclear targets like 12C, 16O, 40Ar and 208Pb. In view of the future experiments to be done
with the antineutrino beams in the medium energy region of few GeV, it is useful to review the current status of the
theoretical and experimental work on this subject.

We also take into account the nuclear medium eﬀects on the production cross section of hyperons in a local density
approximation [67, 82]. The eﬀect of the ﬁnal state interaction of the hyperons on the production cross section and its
Q2 dependence arising due to the strong interactions in the presence of the nucleons in the nuclear medium leading
to elastic and charge exchange reactions like ΣN
ΣN is also taken into account in a simple
model [49]. The eﬀect of the second class current with or without the presence of T-invariance [80, 81] on the total
and the diﬀerential cross sections, and the Q2 dependence of the polarization components of the hyperons have also
been presented.

These hyperons decay into pions through the diﬀerent Y

N π decay modes and contribute to the pion production
cross sections induced by the antineutrinos which is in addition to the pion production cross section through the
excitation of ∆0 and ∆− resonances. Keeping in mind the present and future (anti)neutrino experiments being done
with the accelerator (anti)neutrinos at T2K, MicroBooNE, MiniBooNE, NOνA, MINERνA and DUNE, as well as
the atmospheric (anti)neutrino experiments being planned in this energy region, we have also presented some new
results on the pion production in the kinematic region of these experiments based on the formalism discussed here in
brief in Sections II and III.

In Section II, we describe in brief the formalism for calculating the cross sections and the polarization components
of the Λ, Σ0 and Σ− hyperons produced in the quasielastic reactions of the antineutrinos from the nucleons in the
presence of the second class currents. We also reproduce the essential formalism for the excitation of ∆ in this section
and describe the process of pion production from the hyperon (Y) and ∆ decay. We describe in Section III the eﬀect of

If the T-invariance is assumed then all the vector and the axial vector form factors are real and the expression for
C(Q2) vanishes which implies that the transverse component of polarization, PT (Q2) perpendicular to the production
plane, vanishes.

III. NUCLEAR MEDIUM EFFECTS

A. Hyperons produced inside the nucleus

When the reactions shown in Eqs. (48), (49), (50) take place on nucleons which are bound in the nucleus, Fermi
motion and Pauli blocking eﬀects of initial nucleons are considered. In the present work the Fermi motion eﬀects
are calculated in a local Fermi gas model (LFGM), and the cross section is evaluated as a function of local Fermi
momentum pF (r) and integrated over the whole nucleus. The incoming antineutrino interacts with the nucleon moving
inside the nucleus of density ρN (r) such that the diﬀerential scattering cross section inside the nucleus is expressed
in terms of the diﬀerential scattering cross section for an antineutrino scattering from a free nucleon (Eq. (28)) as

B. Delta produced inside the nucleus

10

When an antineutrino interacts with a nucleon (Eq.38) inside a nuclear target, nuclear medium eﬀects come into
play like Fermi motion, Pauli blocking, etc. The produced ∆s have no such constraints in the production channel but
their decay is inhibited by the Pauli blocking of the ﬁnal nucleons. Also, there are other disappearance channels open
for ∆s through particle hole excitations and this leads to the modiﬁcation in the mass and width of the propagator
deﬁned in Eq.(47).

To take into account the nuclear medium eﬀects, we have evaluated the cross section using the local density
approximation, following the same procedure as mentioned in section-III A, and the diﬀerential scattering cross section
for the reactions given in Eqs. (38) and (39)is deﬁned as :

IV. FINAL STATE INTERACTION EFFECT

A. Pions produced inside the nucleus

1. Delta production

When the reactions, given in Eqs. (51)–(54) take place inside the nucleus, the pions may be produced in two ways,
through the coherent channel and the incoherent channel. If the target nucleus stays in the ground state and does
not loose its identity, giving all the transferred energy in the reaction to the outgoing pion, then the pion production
process is called coherent pion production otherwise if the nucleus can be excited and/or broken up then it leads to
the incoherent production of pions. The contribution of coherent pion production has been found to be less than
2
3% at the antineutrino energies of the present interest [18, 19], and is not discussed here. We have not considered
the contributions from the nonresonant background terms and higher resonances like P11(1440), S11(1535), etc.

where ρN (r) is the nucleon density deﬁned in terms of nuclear density ρ(r). In a nucleus, the contributions to π− and
πo productions come from the neutron and proton targets. These are taken into account using the Clebsch-Gordan
coeﬃcients written in Eqs. (51)–(54). The total production cross section for π− and πo from a nucleus can be written
by replacing ρN as

ρN (r) = ρn(r) +

ρN (r) =

(62)

The pions produced in these processes inside the nucleus may re-scatter or may produce more pions or may get
absorbed while coming out from the ﬁnal nucleus. We have taken the results of Vicente Vacas et al. [98] for the ﬁnal
state interaction of pions which is calculated in an eikonal approximation using probabilities per unit length as the
basic input. The details are given Ref. [98].

2. Hyperon production

→

→

The pions produced as a result of hyperon decays are shown in Eqs. (48), (49) and (50). However, when the hyperons
are produced in a nuclear medium, some of them disappear through the hyperon-nucleon interaction processes like
Y N
N N , though it is suppressed due to nuclear eﬀects [29, 30]. The pionic modes of hyperons are Pauli blocked as
the momentum of the nucleons available in these decays is considerably below the Fermi level of energy for most nuclei
leading to a long lifetime for the hyperons in the nuclear medium [29, 30]. Therefore, the hyperons which survive the
N N decay in the medium live long enough to travel the nuclear medium and decay outside the nucleus. In
Y N
view of this we have assumed no ﬁnal state interaction of the produced pions with the nucleons inside the nuclear
medium. In a realistic situation, all the hyperons produced in these reactions will not survive in the nucleus, and the
pions coming from the decay of hyperons will undergo FSI [49]. A quantitative analysis of the hyperon disappearance
N N interaction and the pions having FSI eﬀect, will require a dynamic nuclear model to estimate
through the Y N
the nonmesonic and mesonic decay of the hyperons in a nucleus which is beyond the scope of the present work. Our
results in the following section, therefore, represent an upper limit on the production of pions arising due to the
production of hyperons.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we ﬁrst present a review of the old experimental results on the total cross sections and their Q2
dependence in the case of hyperon production from CERN on Freon [60] and Propane [59, 61], FNAL on Neon [63, 64],
SKAT on Freon [65] and BNL on H2 [62] and compare them with the theoretical results. We also present the ex-
perimental results on the Lambda hyperon polarizations from CERN [61] and compare them with the most recent
theoretical calculations [82]. The theoretical calculations used for making comparisons with the experimental results

12

are done for the nucleon targets assuming the nuclear medium eﬀects in hyperon production to be small at the energies
relevant for these experiments [49, 61]. The results have also been presented for the total cross sections and their
Q2 dependence for nuclear targets like 12C, 16O, 40Ar and 208Pb with and without the nuclear medium (NME) and
ﬁnal state interaction (FSI) eﬀects. The results have also been presented for the longitudinal (PL(Q2)), perpendic-
ular (PP (Q2)) and transverse (PT (Q2)) components of the polarization vector of the hyperon in the presence of the
second class currents with and without T-invariance by taking the numerical values of g2(0) to be real and imaginary,
respectively.

The following points describe the inputs used for the numerical calculations which have been done to obtain these

results:

1. For the hyperon production cross section oﬀ the free nucleon target, we have integrated over Q2 in Eq. (28)
and obtained the results for the total scattering cross section. For the ∆ production cross section oﬀ the free
nucleon target in the charged current neutrino and antineutrino induced reactions, we have used Eq. (44) and
integrated over the ﬁnal lepton kinematical variables.

2. In the presence of nuclear medium eﬀects the expression of the cross sections given in Eqs.(55) and (56),
respectively for the Y production and the ∆ production, have been used. In the case of hyperon production FSI
arising due to the quasielastic and charge exchange hyperon nucleon scattering has been taken into account as
described in section-III A.

3. For the pion production cross section from the hyperons, we have used the same expression (Eq.(55)) with the
hyperon-nucleon interaction. For the pions arising from the ∆ decay with NME+FSI, we have used Eq. (61)
with the pion FSI eﬀect as described in section-IV A 1. Therefore, FSI eﬀect in the case of pion production from
the hyperons is diﬀerent from the FSI eﬀect for the pion production from the ∆ i.e. there is no pion absorption
in the case of hyperons giving rise to pions, whereas there is pion absorption inside the nucleus when ∆s give
rise to pions.

4. We have used ρp(r) = Z

A ρ(r) for the proton density, and ρn(r) = A−Z
is nuclear density taken as 3-parameter Fermi density for 12C, 16O, 40Ar and 208Pb given by:

second class currents with and without T-invariance. For the axial vector form factors, the expressions used in
Eqs. (18), (19) and (20) for gN Y

the nucleon form factors as they appear in Eqs. (13), (14) and (15) for f N Y

A. Hyperon and Delta productions from free nucleons

1. Hyperon production

In Fig. 3, we have presented the results for the hyperon production cross sections from the free nucleons presented
in Eqs. (1)–(3) as a function of antineutrino energies. These results are presented for the Λ, Σ− and Σ0 cross sections
at the two values of MA viz. MA = 1.026 GeV and 1.2 GeV. We ﬁnd that in this region there is very little dependence
of MA on the cross section in the case of Σ− and Σ0 production, while in the case of Λ production, the cross section
increases with energy and the increase is about 5% at E¯νµ = 1 GeV. In the case of free nucleon, the cross sections for
µ+ + Σ0 are related by a simple relation i.e. σ(¯νµp
µ+Σ−),
¯νµ + n

while no Σ+ is produced oﬀ the free nucleon target due to ∆S
= ∆Q rule. A comparison is made with available
experimental results from CERN [59–61], BNL [62], FNAL [63, 64] and SKAT [65] experiments as well as with
the theoretical calculations performed by Wu et al.[86] and Finjord and Ravndal [55] using quark model and the
calculations performed by Erriquez et al. [61], Brunner et al.[65] and Kuzmin and Naumov [70] based on the prediction
from Cabibbo theory. A reasonable agreement with the experimental results can be seen.

produced in the ﬁnal state at the diﬀerent antineutrino energies viz. E¯νµ = 0.5 GeV, 0.75 GeV and 1 GeV at the two
values of MA viz. MA = 1.026 GeV and 1.2 GeV. One may notice that the Q2-distribution is not much sensitive to
the choice of MA.

In Fig. 5, we have presented the comparison of present results for the Q2 distribution with the results given in Fig.
3 of Ref. [63]. Solid line represents the present results using MA = 1 GeV, dashed-dotted line represents the present
results obtained using Eq. (12) of Ref. [63] and the data points are taken from Ref. [63]. We have multiplied our
results with an arbitrary factor of 7 in order to compare our result with the experimental data points.

In order to compare with the experimental results of CERN experiment [61], we have performed the numerical
calculations for the ﬂux averaged cross section
polarization components
relevant for the antineutrino ﬂux of SPS antineutrino beam of Gargamelle experiment at CERN [99] and present our
results in Table-II. The results are compared with the available experimental results from CERN [59–61] experiment
and the theoretical results quoted by Erriquez et al. [61].

of the polarization provide an alternative method to determine the axial dipole mass, MA, nature of the second class
current (whether with or without TRI) and the pseudoscalar form factor independent of the total and the diﬀerential
scattering cross sections. Moreover, the experimental observation of the transverse component of polarization can be
used to study the physics of T-violation. In Fig. 6, we have made an attempt to explore the possibility of determining
the pseudoscalar form factor gN Y
= 1 sector and studied the sensitivity of the Q2-dependence on the
polarization components PL(Q2), PP (Q2) and PT (Q2) using the expression of Nambu [91] in Eq. (23) for the process
µ+Λ at E¯νµ =0.4 and 0.7 GeV. We see that at E¯νµ = 0.4 GeV, PL(Q2), PP (Q2) and PT (Q2) are sensitive to
¯νµp
gN Y
(Q2) are almost

the same. It seems, therefore, possible in principle, to determine the pseudoscalar form factor in the Λ polarization
measurements at lower antineutrino energies. The total cross section σ and the diﬀerential cross section dσ/dQ2 are
not found to be very sensitive to the values of gN Y

For the reaction ¯νµ + p

µ+ + Λ, we have also studied the dependence of the polarization components on the
second class currents with T-invariance and showed the results for PL(Q2) and PP (Q2) as a function of Q2 in Fig. 7.
These results are presented for the polarization components using the second class current form factor in the presence
of T invariance i.e. using the real values of gnp
3 and M2 = MA in Eq. (22) at the diﬀerent

high antineutrino energies, E¯νµ (say 0.7 GeV) in comparison to the lower energies (say 0.4 GeV). For example, in the
peak region of Q2, the diﬀerence is 80% at Eνµ = 0.7 GeV and it is 20% at Eνµ = 0.4 GeV as gR
2 (0) is changed from
0 to 3. In the case of PP (Q2) also, the Q2 dependence is quite strong and similar to PL(Q2).

2. ∆ production

The results for the ∆ production cross sections are presented in Fig. 9 for νµ and ¯νµ induced processes oﬀ the free
nucleon target. For νµ induced reaction, the leptonic current in Eq. (5) will read as lµ = ¯u(k′)γµ(1
γ5)u(k). In the
case of ∆ production, the cross sections are inhibited by the threshold eﬀect at lower energies, and there is almost no
cross section until E¯νµ = 0.4 GeV. In Fig. 10, the results for dσ/dQ2 are presented for the ∆s produced in the ﬁnal
state at the diﬀerent (anti)neutrino energies viz. Eνµ,¯νµ = 0.5, 0.75 and 1 GeV. The total cross section and its energy
dependence as well as the Q2 dependence have been discussed elsewhere in literature [24, 26, 50, 67, 95].

B. Hyperon and Delta production from nuclei

In Fig. 11, we have presented the results for σ vs E¯νµ , for the ∆0 produced oﬀ the proton bound in various nuclear
targets like 12C, 16O, 40Ar and 208Pb with and without the NMEs. It may be noticed that the NMEs due to the
modiﬁcation of the ∆ properties in nuclei reduce the cross section. In the case of lighter nuclei like 12C and 16O, this

respectively at E¯νµ = 1 GeV. We ﬁnd that the NMEs due to Pauli blocking and Fermi motion eﬀects, in the case
of hyperons in the ﬁnal state, are negligibly small and therefore we have not discussed these eﬀects and the results

of the cross sections are almost the same as for the free hyperon case (Fig. 3). Moreover, when the hyperon-nucleon
interaction i.e. the FSI eﬀect in the hyperon production, is taken into account the overall change in the hyperon
production cross section is very small. These results are used to obtain the ratio of total hyperon to ∆ production
cross sections i.e. σY
σ∆ which have been shown in the inset of these ﬁgures. It may be noticed that due to the threshold
eﬀect initially the hyperon production cross section dominates and with the increase in energy the ratio reduces. Due
to the substantial reduction in the cross section for the ∆ production, the ratio increases when NME is taken into
account in comparison to the free case. Moreover, this ratio is larger in heavy nuclei like 208Pb as NME increases
with the nucleon number.

C. Pion production

In this section the results are presented for the π− and πo productions respectively in the nuclei like 12C, 16O,
40Ar and 208Pb. We give a preview of our main results for π− and πo productions before they are presented in detail
in Figs. Figs. 12-15 and Figs. 16-19 for each case. These results are shown for the cross sections obtained without
and with NME+FSI eﬀect for the pion production arising due to the Λ production, total hyperon(Y) production
and the ∆ production. In the case of hyperon production, NMEs in the production process as well as the FSI due
to hyperon-nucleon interactions have been taken into account. Moreover, we do not include the FSI of pions within
the nuclear medium which are produced as a result of hyperon decays. This is because the decay width of pionic

decay modes of hyperons is highly suppressed in the nuclear medium. Due to which these hyperons live long enough
to pass through the nucleus and decay outside the nuclear medium. Thus, the produced pions are less aﬀected by
the strong interaction of nuclear ﬁeld. This is not the case with the pion produced through strong decays of ∆, as
they are further suppressed by the strong absorption of pions in the nuclear medium. Therefore, in the low energy
region the Cabibbo suppression in the case of pion production through hyperons get compensated by the threshold
suppression as well as by the strong pion absorption eﬀects in the case of the pions produced through the Delta
excitation. On the other hand, FSI due to Σ
N interactions in various channels tend to increase the
−
Λ production cross section and decrease the Σ− production cross section, which is mainly a threshold eﬀect. The
quantitative increase (decrease) in Λ(Σ) yield due to FSI increases with the increase in the nucleon number. The
interaction of hyperons with the nucleons bound inside the nucleus, separately aﬀect Σ− and Σ0 productions and the

FIG. 20: Results for the νµ induced π+ and πo production cross sections and ¯νµ induced π− and πo production cross sections.

is coming from the ∆ as well as the hyperons. The results are presented for 12C, 16O, 40Ar and 208Pb with NME+FSI. Notice
that π+ production cross section has been reduced by half to bring it on the same scale.

This ratio directly tells us the enhancement of the ratio RA due to NME+FSI with the increase in the mass number

while the change in the total hyperon production cross section results in a decrease in the cross section due to the
FSI eﬀect which is about 3

NME+FSI lead to a reduction of around 50% in the π− production for the antineutrino energies 0.6 < E¯νµ < 1GeV.
This results in the change in the ratio of RN (Eq. (65)) from 0.28 and 0.14 respectively at E¯νµ =0.6 and 1GeV to

In the case of heavy nuclear target like 208Pb, the change in the cross section due to NME+FSI is quite large and
the results for σ vs E¯νµ , for ¯νµ scattering oﬀ the nucleon in 208Pb nuclear target are shown in Fig.15. For example, the
reduction in the cross section due to NME+FSI when a ∆ is produced as the resonant state, is about 75% at E¯νµ =
0.6 GeV and 70% at E¯νµ = 1 GeV from the cross sections calculated without the medium eﬀect. The enhancement

In Figs. 16, 17, 18 and 19, we have presented the results for the total scattering cross section σ vs E¯νµ , for ¯νµ
scattering oﬀ nucleon in 12C, 16O, 40Ar and 208Pb nuclear targets giving rise to πo. These results are presented for
the pion production from ∆, Λ and Y with and without NME+FSI. In the case of πo arising due to hyperon decay,
the contribution comes from the Λ and Σ0 decay, while there is no contribution from Σ−. Due to the FSI eﬀect there
is substantial increase in the Λ production cross section and reduction in the Σ0 production cross section from the
free case, which leads to an overall increase in the πo production. Therefore, unlike the π− production where there is
overall reduction, in the case of πo production there is an increase in the cross section which is about 13
14% in 12C
and 16O, 22
38% in 208Pb for E¯νµ = 0.6 to 1 GeV. The diﬀerent Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients
for ∆ (in Eqs. (51)–(54)) and the branching ratios for the hyperons (in Eqs. (48), (49), (50)) give a diﬀerent ratios
of RN and RA. This results in the change in the ratio of RN from 0.58 and 0.26 respectively at E¯νµ = 0.6 and 1
GeV to RA
1.3 and 0.5 in 12C and 16O, from 0.55 and 0.25 respectively at E¯νµ = 0.6 and 1 GeV to 1.68 and
0.66 in 40Ar, and from 0.56 and 0.26 respectively at E¯νµ = 0.6 and 1 GeV to 3 and 1.2 in 208Pb. Thus, in the case
of πo production, there is signiﬁcant increase in Y

expression of ρN (r) in Eq. (62) will become ρN (r) = ρp(r) + 1
9 ρn(r). These results are shown for 12C, 16O, 40Ar and
208Pb with NME+FSI. For νµ scattering, the contribution to the pions is coming from ∆ only, while for ¯νµ scattering
the contribution to the pions is coming from the ∆ as well the hyperons. Though in the case of the pions produced
through the hyperon production, there is an overall suppression by a factor of sin2θc but these are kinematically
favored as the Λ production starts around E¯νµ = 250 MeV, while Σ− and Σ0 production start around E¯νµ = 325
MeV, and there is overall no NME eﬀect on the total hyperon production and no FSI eﬀect on the outgoing pions,
whereas the reduction is quite signiﬁcant for the pions arising from the ∆s.

In Figs. 21, 22, 23 and 24, we have presented the results for the Q2 distribution i.e. dσ

dQ2 vs Q2 in 12C, 16O, 40Ar and
208Pb nuclear targets with NME+FSI at the diﬀerent incident antineutrino energies viz. E¯νµ = 0.5 GeV, 0.75 GeV
and 1 GeV. These results are presented for the π− contribution from the ∆s and the hyperons. It may be observed
that at low E¯νµ , π− has signiﬁcant contribution from the hyperons, like at E¯νµ = 0.5 GeV, in the peak region of Q2,
40% in 12C, 16O and 40Ar and 50% in 208Pb of the total π− production, while with the increase
hyperons contribute
in energy the contribution from the hyperons decreases, for example, at E¯νµ = 1 GeV hyperons contribute 16% in
12C, 16O and 40Ar and 24% in 208Pb. The peak region of Q2 for the hyperons shifts towards the lower Q2 than the ∆s.
In the case of πo(not shown here), the results are similar except that the contributions from the hyperons dominate
at lower energies in all the nuclear targets in comparison to the ∆ contributions and the dominance increases with
the increase in the nuclear mass number.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have presented a review of the theoretical and experimental work done on the quasielatic production
of hyperons induced by antineutrinos which was started more than 50 years ago soon after the V
A theory of weak
interactions was extended to the strangeness sector by Cabibbo [41] using SU(3) symmetry properties of the weak
hadronic currents. The experimental results on the total cross sections and their Q2 dependence available from the
older experiments at CERN [59–61], FNAL [63, 64], SKAT [65] and BNL [62] and the results on Lambda hyperon
polarizations from CERN [61] are compared with the most recent theoretical results [81, 82].

−

In view of the future experiments proposed with the antineutrinos at the accelerator and atmospheric antineutrino
experiments in the medium energy region of few GeV on the nuclear targets like 12C, 16O, 40Ar and 208Pb. We have
also presented a summary of the recent theoretical works on the total cross sections, polarization components and
their Q2 dependence corresponding to many energies relevant for these experiments. These results may be useful
in determining the axial vector transition form factor in the strangeness sector specially for the pseudoscalar form
factor and the form factor corresponding to the second class currents with and without T-invariance and test the
validity of various symmetry properties of the weak hadronic currents. We have also studied the contribution of
hyperons produced in these reactions towards the ¯ν induced pion production cross sections in the neutrino oscillation
experiments being done at T2K, MINERνA, DUNE, SUPER-K and HYPER-K.

We summarize our results in the following:

(A) In the case of the nucleon targets:

(i) The hyperon production is generally Cabibbo suppressed as compared to the ∆ production but in the low
energy region of E¯νµ < 0.6 GeV it could be comparable to the ∆ production due to the threshold eﬀects.

(ii) (a) The Q2 distributions are sensitive to the pseudoscalar form factor at lower antineutrino energies.

(b) The longitudinal PL(Q2) as well as the perpendicular PP (Q2) components of the hyperon polarization

are sensitive to the pseudoscalar form factor g3(Q2) specially at lower energies.

(iii) In the presence of the second class currents with T-invariance:

(a) The Q2 distribution is not much sensitive to the presence of the second class current until its coupling

strength gR

2 (0) becomes large i.e.

gR
2 (0)
|

|

> 1.

(b) The longitudinal component of the polarization PL(Q2) is positive at lower antineutrino energies and
2 (0) > 1.
2 (0) taken

2 (0) taken to be positive and large i.e. gR
(c) The perpendicular component of the polarization PP (Q2) is negative for all the values of gR

becomes negative at higher energies for the values of gR

to be positive or negative in the energy range of the present interest.

(iv) In the presence of the second class currents without T-invariance:

(a) The Q2 distribution is not much sensitive to the second class current unless gI

2(0) > 1.

(b) The transverse component of the polarization PT (Q2) is nonvanishing and it increases with gI

2(0). It
2(0) is reversed and the absolute value of PT (Q2) increases with the

changes sign when the sign of gI
increase in the energy.

27

(c) The longitudinal(PL(Q2)) and the perpendicular(PP (Q2)) components of the polarization are not very

sensitive to the choice of gI

2(0).

(B) In the case of the nuclear targets:

(i) The eﬀect of NME and FSI is to increase the production of Λ-hyperon and to decrease the production of Σ-
Σ N , but

hyperons in the nuclear medium due to charge exchange processes like Σ N
the total hyperon production remains the same.

(ii) In the case of the ∆ production cross sections, the NME+FSI eﬀect reduces the cross section signiﬁcantly. This
reduction in the cross section increases with the increase in mass number, for example, at E¯νµ = 1 GeV in the
case of 12C, 16O and 40Ar, the reduction in the cross section is in the range of 40
50% which becomes 70% in
the case of 208Pb.

−

(iii) The reduction due to NME+FSI eﬀects in the case of pions obtained from ∆ excitation is large enough to
compensate for Cabibbo suppression of pions produced through the hyperon decay specially in the low energy
region. Because of this, the pion production from the hyperons is comparable to the pion production from the ∆
excitation up to the antineutrino energies of about 0.5 GeV for π− production and 0.65 GeV for πo production.

(iv) The ratio of pions produced through Y and ∆ excitations in nuclei increases with the mass number due to
the ﬁnal state interactions of the pions as the pions coming from the ∆ decays are suppressed due to FSI as
compared to the pions coming from the hyperons. This ratio decreases with the increase in the antineutrino
energies.

(v) We have also presented the numerical results for dσ/dQ2 in the various nuclear targets like 12C, 16O, 40Ar and

208Pb at the diﬀerent antineutrino energies.

Thus, to conclude, the contribution of hyperon production to the π− and πo productions induced by the antineu-

trinos on the nuclear targets is important specially in the sub-GeV energy region.
