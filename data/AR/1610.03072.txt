ABSTRACT

We present near-infrared spectra of ten planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Large
and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), acquired with the FIRE and
GNIRS spectrometers on the 6.5-m Baade and 8.1-m Gemini South Telescopes,
respectively. We detect Se and/or Kr emission lines in eight of these objects, the
ﬁrst detections of n-capture elements in Magellanic Cloud PNe. Our abundance
analysis shows large s-process enrichments of Kr (0.6–1.3 dex) in the six PNe in
which it was detected, and Se is enriched by 0.5–0.9 dex in ﬁve objects. We also
estimate upper limits to Rb and Cd abundances in these objects. Our abundance
results for the LMC are consistent with the hypothesis that PNe with 2–3 M⊙
progenitors dominate the bright end of the PN luminosity function in young gas-
rich galaxies. We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant correlations between s-process enrichments
and other elemental abundances, central star temperature, or progenitor mass,
though this is likely due to our small sample size. We determine S abundances
from our spectra and ﬁnd that [S/H] agrees with [Ar/H] to within 0.2 dex for
most objects, but is lower than [O/H] by 0.2–0.4 dex in some PNe, possibly due
to O enrichment via third dredge-up. Our results demonstrate that n-capture
elements can be detected in PNe belonging to nearby galaxies with ground-based
telescopes, allowing s-process enrichments to be studied in PN populations with
well-determined distances.

INTRODUCTION

Emission lines of neutron(n)-capture elements (atomic number Z > 30) were ﬁrst iden-
tiﬁed in a planetary nebula (PN) in 1994 (P´equignot & Baluteau 1994), and since have been
detected in more than 100 Galactic PNe (e.g., Sharpee et al. 2007; Sterling & Dinerstein
2008; Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. 2015). Trans-iron elements can be produced by slow n-capture
nucleosynthesis (the “s-process”) in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and transported
to the stellar envelope by third dredge-up (TDU) before being expelled via stellar winds and
PN ejection (Karakas & Lattanzio 2014). Comparisons of empirically-determined s-process
enrichments in PNe to theoretical predictions provide valuable constraints to models of AGB
nucleosynthesis (Karakas et al. 2009; Sterling et al. 2016).

To date, nebular n-capture element abundance determinations have almost exclusively
been limited to Galactic PNe, whose primarily statistical distances can have substantial
uncertainties (though improved calibrations to statistical distance scales show promise for
better accuracies; Frew et al. 2016, and references therein). Because of the uncertain dis-
tances, it has not been possible to study s-process enrichments along the PN luminosity
function (PNLF, Jacoby 1989) – which prevents robust estimates of the fraction of PNe that
are s-process enriched (Sterling & Dinerstein 2008) – or as a function of initial stellar mass.

Extragalactic PNe do not suﬀer from the distance uncertainties that plague Galactic
objects. However this advantage comes at a cost, as the large distances of these PNe render
the detection of faint emission lines diﬃcult. Nevertheless, it is possible to detect n-capture
elements in Local Group PNe with suﬃciently large-aperture telescopes.

The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) are optimal targets for such
a study, given their relative proximity (50 and 60 kpc, respectively; Keller & Wood 2006),
minimal foreground extinction, and relatively well-studied PN populations. A signiﬁcant
fraction of LMC and SMC PNe have been identiﬁed (Reid 2014; Draˇskovi´c et al. 2015),
and elemental abundances have been determined in a large number of these objects (e.g.,
Leisy & Dennefeld 2006, and references therein). In addition, progenitor star masses have
been estimated for some PNe in these galaxies (Villaver et al. 2003, 2004, 2007).

1This paper includes data obtained with the 6.5-m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Obser-

vatory, Chile, and with the Gemini-South Telescope at Cerro Pachon, Chile.

In this letter we present the detection of near-infrared [Kr III] and [Se IV] emission
lines in ten bright LMC and SMC PNe. To our knowledge these are the ﬁrst detections
of n-capture elements in extragalactic PNe other than the Sagittarius Dwarf (Wood et al.
2006; Otsuka et al. 2011).

2. OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTIONS

In Table 1 we provide an observing log and nebular and stellar parameters for our sam-
ple. Nine of the ten PNe were observed with the Folded-Port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE)
spectrograph (Simcoe et al. 2013) on the 6.5-m Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observa-
tory. We used a 0.′′75 slit width to provide a resolution R = 4800 in echelle mode, covering the
spectral range 0.83–2.45 µm. Because the targets have diameters comparable to or smaller
than the slit width, light loss primarily occurred due to seeing conditions, which were typi-
cally less than 1′′ but ranged from 2′′–4′′ for LMC SMP 73 and SMC SMP 15. We nodded
along the slit in ABBA sequences for maximum observing eﬃciency. The data were reduced
using the FIREHOSE IDL reduction pipeline2. Th-Ar lamps were used to wavelength cali-
brate the spectra, and A0V standard stars were observed for each object to perform relative
ﬂux calibrations and telluric corrections.

LMC SMP 62 and SMC SMP 20 were observed in the K band with the Gemini
Near-InfraRed Spectrograph (GNIRS) on the 8.1-m Gemini South telescope. We used the
111 l/mm grating in third order with a 0.′′45×99′′ slit, for an eﬀective resolving power of
R = 4000 in the wavelength range 2.1–2.3 µm. The data were taken in queue mode under
observing program GS-2006B-Q-51. We beam-switched by nodding the target along the slit.
The wavelength scale was established with an Ar arc lamp, and A0V standard stars were
observed for ﬂux calibration and telluric absorption corrections. The data were reduced us-
ing the FIGARO software package (Shortridge 1993). Fluxes and upper limits in the Gemini
K band spectrum of SMP 20 agree well with our FIRE data, and we restrict our analysis to
the FIRE data for this PN.

3. LINE MEASUREMENTS AND ABUNDANCE ANALYSIS

The FIRE spectra are very rich, with 80–110 emission lines detected in LMC objects and
60–85 in SMC PNe. We detect metal lines including [C I], [P II], [S II], [S III], [Fe III], [Kr III],

and [Se IV], and several LMC PNe exhibit H2 lines. We have also detected [Kr VI] 1.2333 µm3
in LMC SMP 47 and SMP 99, and will discuss this identiﬁcation in a forthcoming paper.
Notably, Kr and/or Se were detected in all seven of the observed LMC PNe, and in one of
the three SMC objects (Figure 1).

We measured line ﬂuxes by integrating under the proﬁle of each line above a local con-
tinuum using IDL routines, varying the continuum placement to estimate ﬂux uncertainties.
Gaussian ﬁts were performed for blended features. We also measured 3-σ upper limits to
the [Rb IV] 1.5973, [Cd IV] 1.7203, and [Ge VI] 2.1930 µm lines identiﬁed by Sterling et al.

(2016) and to [Se III] features. Line ﬂuxes and intensities relative to H I Brγ are reported in
Table 2.

For our abundance analysis, we adopt extinction coeﬃcients, temperatures, densities,
and ionic abundances used in ionization correction factors (ICFs) from the literature (see
Table 1 for references). We adopt 10% uncertainties for He ionic abundances from the
literature, and 30% for those of O and Ar. MD91 and LD06 do not report ionic abundances,
and we derived these values from their listed intensities.

We calculated ionic and elemental abundances with the PyNeb analysis package (Luridiana et al.

2015), using the atomic data sources of Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. (2015, see their Table 5), with
the exceptions of Rb3+, Cd3+, and Ge5+ for which we use the atomic data of Sterling et al.
(2016). To minimize uncertainties due to errors in the ﬂux calibration or adopted extinction
coeﬃcients, we computed ionic abundances relative to nearby H I lines: 11–3 for lines with
wavelengths ≤1.0 µm, Paβ for the J band, Brζ for H band lines, and Brγ in the K band.

The [Se IV] 2.2864 µm line can be contaminated by H2 3-2 S(2) 2.2870 µm in PNe with
ﬂuorescent H2 emission (Dinerstein 2001), and this must be accounted for when comput-
ing Se3+/H+ abundances. The strengths of H2 lines from the v = 2 and v = 3 levels in
LMC SMP 47 and 85 are indicative of ﬂuorescent excitation of moderately dense gas. For
such conditions, the intensity of H2 3-2 S(2) is about 0.8 times that of the 3-2 S(3) line (e.g.,
model 14 of Black & van Dishoeck 1987, for which n = 3 × 103 cm−3). We use these values
to correct the measured ﬂuxes at 2.287 µm for the contribution of H2. The absence of the
3-2 S(3) line indicates that such corrections are not needed for the other PNe.

We report ionic abundances in Table 3. The error bars include uncertainties in the line
ﬂuxes, and assumed error bars of 1000 K in Te and 20% for ne values from the literature.
All abundance uncertainties were propagated via Monte Carlo simulations.

To convert ionic abundances to elemental abundances, we employ the ICF formulae of
Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014) for light elements and those of Sterling et al. (2015, 2016) for n-
capture elements. Uncertainties to the ICFs are the recommendations of Delgado-Inglada et al.
(2014) for O, S, and Ar, and were propagated from the ionic and elemental abundances used
in the ICF prescriptions for n-capture elements. In the case of the Kr ICF, we use Equa-
tion 1 of Sterling et al. (2015), which depends on S2+/S, rather than Equation 2 (which
uses Ar2+/Ar), since [Ar III] lines were not detected in SMP 62 (LD06) and the derived Ar
abundance in SMP 85 is larger than the solar value (Asplund et al. 2009) and appears to be
inaccurate. The two equations produce Kr ICFs that agree to within 25% for our targets
except for SMC SMP 20 (in which Kr is not detected), with no systematic trends. Therefore
this choice does not aﬀect our results.

In Table 4 we give elemental abundances relative to the solar values of Asplund et al.
(2009), with uncertainties accounting for those in the ionic abundances and ICFs. Our
derived O abundances agree with literature values (MD91; T03; LD06; S10) to within 25%
or better, while those for Ar show more scatter but agree to within 40% for most PNe. Our
S abundances are factors of 2–14 lower than the values of LD06, in line with the ﬁndings of
Bernard-Salas et al. (2008) and Shaw et al. (2010).

4. ABUNDANCE PATTERNS AND ENRICHMENTS

4.1. Evidence for Third Dredge-Up and Choice of a Metallicity Reference

TDU conveys C-rich and s-process enriched material to the envelopes of AGB stars
(Karakas & Lattanzio 2014), and therefore C-rich PNe can be expected to exhibit s-process
enrichments. With the exceptions of LMC SMP 62 (Aller et al. 1987) and SMP 6 (no C
abundance available), all PNe in our sample have C/O ratios of unity or larger, and thus
experienced TDU.

To determine whether a PN is s-process enriched it is necessary to compare n-capture
element abundances to that of an element representative of the metallicity [Fe/H], since Fe
abundances cannot be accurately determined in nebulae due to depletion into dust (e.g.,
Delgado-Inglada & Rodr´ıguez 2014). In LMC ﬁeld giants, α-elements such as O, Mg, Si,
Ca, and Ti are approximately solar relative to Fe ([α/Fe] = −0.1 to 0.1) at the average
LMC metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.5 (e.g., Lapenna et al. 2012; Van der Swaelmen et al. 2013).
Similarly, in SMC red giants [α/Fe] = 0.0–0.1 (Mucciarelli 2014). Therefore α-elements
appear to be good tracers of [Fe/H] in these galaxies.

Of the α-species, oxygen is the most widely-used metallicity tracer in PNe since its abun-
dance is usually the most accurately determined. However, models of AGB nucleosynthesis
predict that at low metallicities TDU can enrich O, although the amount of enrichment dif-
fers among diﬀerent AGB evolutionary codes (e.g., Cristallo et al. 2015; Ventura et al. 2015;
Karakas & Lugaro 2016). Furthermore, these calculations all show that for initial masses
& 4 M⊙, O can be depleted by the CNO cycle during hot bottom burning (HBB: H-burning
at the base of the convective envelope).

LD06 found evidence for both O enrichment and destruction in a sample of 183 LMC
and SMC PNe. We ﬁnd similar eﬀects in our abundance analysis. In several of our observed
PNe, [O/(S, Ar)] = 0.2–0.4, indicating that TDU may have enhanced O in their progenitor
stars. In contrast the Type I PN LMC SMP 47, which likely experienced HBB based on
its large N/O ratio (LD06), has subsolar [O/(S, Ar)], indicating that O depletion may have
occurred. For some PNe, [O/(S, Ar)] is solar within the abundance uncertainties, but for
uniformity we use S and Ar as tracers of [Fe/H] for all of our targets.

4.2. Neutron-Capture Element Abundances

In assessing whether our targets are self-enriched by s-process nucleosynthesis, it should
be noted that the initial abundances of n-capture elements in the progenitor stars of our

– 12 –

sample may not follow the solar abundance pattern, due to the diﬀerent star formation
histories and chemical evolution of the Magellanic Clouds compared to the Milky Way.
Various studies ﬁnd diﬀerent ratios of trans-iron element abundances relative to Fe in pre-
AGB LMC stars. The case of the SMC appears simpler, if only because there are few
n-capture element abundance determinations in its red giant stars.

Se, Kr, and Rb lie on or below the ﬁrst (“light-s,” or ls) s-process peak, but these
elements have not been detected in the spectra of late-type stars in the LMC or SMC.
Instead we compare our results with Y and Zr, two light-s elements that are relatively
well-studied in stars. Pomp´eia et al. (2008) found [ls/Fe] = −0.4 to –0.5 dex in inner-disk
LMC stars, while [ls/Fe] is approximately solar in clusters (Colucci et al. 2012) and the disk
stars investigated by Van der Swaelmen et al. (2013). For elements belonging to the second
(“heavy-s,” or hs) peak (e.g., La), abundances from the above studies give [hs/Fe] = 0.2–0.5.
In SMC Cepheids, Luck et al. (1998) found that [ls/Fe] is slightly subsolar (–0.20 to –0.05
dex) while [hs/Fe] is 0.1–0.3 dex.

Based on this information, we consider Se, Kr, and Rb to be enriched in LMC and SMC
PNe if their abundances relative to S or Ar are larger than solar. Kr is strongly enriched in
all PNe in which it was detected, by 0.6 dex (SMP 63) to as much as 1.3 dex (SMP 85 and
SMP 99) in LMC PNe, and by 0.6 dex in SMC SMP 17. Se is also enriched in ﬁve of the
targets, by 0.5–0.9 dex in the LMC and 0.5 dex in SMP 17.

The derived Se and Kr enrichment factors in these PNe generally agree with model
predictions for these metallicities (Cristallo et al. 2015; Karakas & Lugaro 2016). Given that
these models predict that elements in the second s-process peak should be more strongly
enriched at low metallicities than those in the ﬁrst peak, the large Se and Kr enrichments
indicate that even greater enhancements of heavier n-capture elements can be expected.
While our nominal upper limits on [Cd/(S, Ar)] do not conform to this expectation, we
note that our Cd abundances in two Galactic PNe are lower than predicted by models
(Sterling et al. 2016), which suggests that the disagreement is likely due to uncertainties in
the atomic data and/or ICF for this element.

The Type I PN LMC SMP 47 has both C/O and N/O ratios exceeding unity, suggesting
that it experienced TDU after the cessation of HBB and has a progenitor mass ∼3.5 M⊙ ≤
M < 6 M⊙ (Ventura et al. 2015). The Rb abundance can also place limits on the progenitor
mass, since this element can be strongly enriched if 22Ne(α, n)25Mg dominates neutron
production (Garc´ıa-Hern´andez et al. 2009; Karakas et al. 2012) as opposed to 13C(α, n)16O,
the neutron source in less massive AGB stars. SMP 47 shows no signiﬁcant enrichment of
Rb, indicating that the 13C source dominated neutron production in its progenitor and that
its initial mass is . 5.5 M⊙ (Karakas & Lugaro 2016). This limit agrees with the predictions

– 13 –

of Ventura et al. (2015).

The fact that the distances to the Magellanic Clouds are well known enables us to study
the enrichment patterns as a function of PN luminosity and progenitor mass. Since this is a
brightness-limited sample, we preferentially selected objects at the bright end of the PNLF,
whose formation mechanism has been widely debated (e.g., Ciardullo et al. 2005, and refer-
ences therein). The substantial Se and especially Kr enrichments in the LMC PNe4 are consis-
tent with the interpretation (based on single-star evolution) that such bright PNe are primar-
ily produced by stars with initial masses of 2–3 M⊙ (which are expected to have the largest
s-process enrichments; e.g., Cristallo et al. 2015; Karakas & Lugaro 2016). The estimated
progenitor mass (1.5–2.0 M⊙) for SMP 63 (Villaver et al. 2003) approximately agrees with
this interpretation, but progenitor masses for our other LMC targets are unknown. Interest-
ingly, this result appears to be at odds with the statistical analysis of Badenes et al. (2015),
who found that the most luminous PNe in the LMC (L5007 ≥ 4 × 1034 erg s−1, corresponding
to m5007 ≤ 18.44) predominantly arise from stars with initial masses 1.0–1.2 M⊙. Binary star
formation mechanisms cannot be dismissed for luminous PNe (e.g., Ciardullo et al. 2005),
but comparisons of CNO abundances to nucleosynthesis models (Ventura et al. 2015) and
the progenitor masses computed by Villaver et al. (2003, 2007) provide evidence for a range
of initial stellar masses (from ∼1 M⊙ to as high as 6-8 M⊙) for LMC PNe within a few
magnitudes of the bright cutoﬀ. Our current sample is too small to support strong conclu-
sions regarding progenitor mass distributions. Determinations of s-process enhancements in
a larger number of Magellanic Cloud PNe are needed for statistically meaningful constraints
on the progenitors of luminous PNe in gas-rich galaxies.

We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant correlations between s-process enrichments and other nebular and
stellar parameters, including C/O and N/O, central star temperature, and progenitor mass.
The small size of our sample clearly limits our ability to test these relations, but the success
of our observations demonstrates that it is feasible to expand this study to other PNe in
the Magellanic Clouds. The James Webb Space Telescope will enable such investigations to
be extended to more distant Local Group galaxies, as well as to PNe well below the bright
cutoﬀ of the PNLF in these systems.
