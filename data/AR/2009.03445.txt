ABSTRACT
We report the temporal evolution of the excess brightness temperature ∆Tb above solar active
regions (ARs) observed with the Solar Submillimeter Telescope (SST) at 212 (λ = 1.4 mm) and 405
GHz (λ = 0.7 mm) during Cycles 23 and 24. Comparison with the sunspot number (SSN) yields a
Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient R = 0.88 and 0.74 for 212 and 405 GHz, respectively. Moreover, when
only Cycle 24 is taken into account the correlation coeﬃcients go to 0.93 and 0.81 for each frequency.
We derive the spectral index α between SST frequencies and found a slight anti-correlation with the
SSN (R = −0.25); however, since the amplitude of the variation is lower than the standard deviation
we cannot draw a deﬁnite conclusion. Indeed, α remains almost constant within the uncertainties with
a median value of ≈ 0 characteristic of an optically thick thermal source. Since the origin of the AR
submillimeter radiation is thermal continuum produced at chromospheric heights, the strong correlation
between ∆Tb and the magnetic cycle evolution could be related to the available free magnetic energy
to be released in reconnection events.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar active regions (ARs) are the “ The totality of all observable phenomena preceding, accompanying and following
the birth of sunspots including radio-, X-, EUV- and particle emission.” (extracted from van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green
2015). In particular at radio frequencies they are areas of enhanced brightness on the solar disk observed near sunspots.
At microwaves Selhorst et al. (2014) have shown the correlation between the monthly average of the maximum and
mean excess brightness temperatures at 17 GHz of ARs and the solar cycle, this work is based on images obtained by
the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH, Nakajima et al. 1994) with synthesized beam sizes of the order of 10 arcsec.
Kundu (1970) conducted the ﬁrst millimeter observations using the 11 m (36-foot) single dish antenna installed at
Kitt Peak (USA). Around 40 solar maps were obtained at 33.3, 85.6 and 249.8 GHz (although only three at the last
frequency) with spatial resolutions between 3(cid:48).5 and 1(cid:48).2 from which he derived typical brightness temperatures of
1000, 700 and 150 K for the three frequencies, respectively. Using the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) Bas-
tian et al. (1993) were able to analyze brightness observed at 352 GHz, associated with Hα ﬁlaments and determined
temperatures close to or below that of the quiet Sun. Moreover, they observed a prominence at 352 and 240 GHz; in
both cases they arrived to the conclusion that the millimeter/submillimeter emission of ﬁlaments and prominences is

optically thin. At higher frequencies Lindsey & Kopp (1995) used the James Clerck Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to
make maps of the Sun at 250, 350 and 855 GHz with beam sizes between 16 to 5 arcsec. They showed for the ﬁrst
time that sunspots, when observed at submillimeter wavelengths, have an umbra cooler than the quiet Sun, while
their penumbrae could have temperatures similar to that of the quiet Sun; furthermore, in some ARs, sunspots could
be as hot as the surrounding plages. Indeed, Iwai & Shimojo (2015) used the 45 m Nobeyama telescope to determine
the temperature of the umbra and penumbra at 85 and 115 GHz and also reported ﬁnding an umbra cooler than the
quiet Sun. These ﬁndings were recently conﬁrmed by Loukitcheva et al. (2017) and Iwai et al. (2017), using the images
obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) with a synthesized beam of 0.5 arcsec at frequencies of
100 (λ = 3.0 mm) and 239 GHz (λ = 1.2 mm). With lower spatial resolution, Silva et al. (2005) analyzed ARs during
23 days at 212 (λ = 1.4 mm) and 405 GHz (λ = 0.7 mm) with the Solar Submillimeter Telescope, adding complemen-
tary data from NoRH at 17 and 34 GHz (λ = 8.8 mm). They concluded that an overall AR behaves as an optically
thick thermal source, because of the average ﬂux density spectral index α (cid:39) 2. This result was conﬁrmed by Valle
Silva et al. (2020), who, besides SST and NoRH, included single dish ALMA maps at 107 (λ = 2.8 mm) and 239 GHz
(λ = 1.2 mm). Moreover, they showed that an AR without associated sunspots has a harder ﬂux density spectral index.

However, a study comprising a whole solar cycle at submillimeter wavelengths, analyzing possible changes in the AR
characteristics, was never before attempted. Garcia Pereira et al. (2020) used SST and NoRH observations obtained
between 2001 and 2017, and an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) algorithm, based on neural networks and computer vision,
to identify, extract, classify and obtain physical properties of ARs observed in more than 16,000 maps. They showed
that the number of ARs per year follows the solar cycle, and conﬁrmed, at a solar cycle time-scale, Silva et al. (2005)
and Valle Silva et al. (2020) conclusions. In the present work, we use the statistical results from Garcia Pereira et al.
(2020) and focus in the temporal evolution of the physical properties of ARs at submillimeter wavelengths.

2. DATA REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS

The SST (Kaufmann et al. 2008) is a multi-beam radio telescope, installed at the Complejo Astronmico El Leoncito
(CASLEO, Argentina), composed of six independent radiometers arranged in the focus of a Cassegrain 1.5 m antenna
that observe simultaneously. Daily and continuous observations started on March 2001 and, with few stops for
maintenance work, SST already gathered almost 20 years of data. SST main objective is to spectrally and spatially
characterize ﬂares at the frequencies of 212 and 405 GHz. SST nominal half-power beam widths (HPBW) are 4 and
2 arcmin for 212 and 405 GHz, respectively. However, structural problems of the antenna produce deformations to

and ∼ 2(cid:48) at the -3 dB (50 %) level along the major and minor axis, respectively. By making radial solar maps
and applying a tomographic reconstruction method, we determine the SST beams up to the level of -13 dB (5 %,
Costa et al. 2002). The reconstructed beams have similar characteristics among receivers of equal frequency.
In
order to assess the eﬀect of the beam shapes on the observed sources, we have simulated observations convolving
high resolution EUV images with the SST reconstructed beams. Simulations, instead of observations, are free from
other aspects that aﬀect diﬀerently observations at the two frequencies, such as atmospheric attenuation, receivers
temperatures and gains. On the other hand, we choose an SDO/AIA 304 ˚A image (Lemen et al. 2012) because it
is representative of thermal emission from the chromosphere/transition region, has a high contrast with respect to
the quiet Sun and presents features of diﬀerent sizes. Figure 1 shows the convolution of an SDO/AIA 304 ˚A image
taken on 26 March 2011 at 15:02 UT with a pixel size of 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48) × 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48) with a 212 GHz (top left) and 405 GHz beam
(top right). Despite the sources have diﬀerent sizes, all of them present similar characteristics after the convolution
with the beams at both wavelengths. This can be veriﬁed in the proﬁles also shown in the same ﬁgure (top middle):
(a) is a proﬁle in the X direction and (b) in the Y direction, their positions are represented with blue straight lines
in the simulated maps. Blue and red curves are the proﬁles across the disk in function of position for the 212 and
405 GHz synthesized maps, respectively. Black curves are the diﬀerence between proﬁles. The real observed maps
are shown in the bottom panel: the 212 GHz map on the left and the 405 GHz map on the right. In the middle
panel we include the SDO/AIA image used to synthesize the SST maps, with the antenna beams depicted in the insets.

The uncooled receivers have typical temperatures TR ≈ 2500 − 3500 K, similar bandwidths ∆ν = 4 GHz, and
integration times δt = 40 milliseconds. During a solar observation the maximum expected antenna temperature
is Ta ≈ 6000 K (i.e. no atmospheric attenuation and beam eﬃciency ≈ 1), yielding a root mean square system

More important than the noise temperature is the atmospheric opacity at El Leoncito which can mildly attenuate the
radiation at 212 GHz but can severely reduce the emission at 405 GHz (Melo et al. 2005; Cassiano et al. 2018).

SST provides several solar maps per day as a calibration procedure. These maps are the basic data of our work.
SST solar maps are typically made out of azimuth raster scans (on-the-ﬂy maps) of 60 arcmin length. The elevation
changes at every scan to make a square that covers the entire solar disk. A typical map has a separation between
scans equal to 2 arcmin. The scan speed is between 0.1 to 0.2 deg s−1. Since we use 40 millisecond integrated data,
these speeds produce a separation between successive points in azimuth between 0.24 to 0.48 arcmin. Therefore,
observations are oversampled in azimuth creating a rectanglular pixel of (0.24 − 0.48) × 2 arcmin2; maps have either
375 × 31 pixels or 187 × 31 pixels. We interpolate the raw data to create a square map with a ﬁeld of view of 31 arcmin
and 288 × 288 pixels. Then, the map is rotated with north up and the collected intensity units are converted to
temperature, using the Sun brightness temperature as a reference (see Silva et al. 2005). We note that there is no
need to equalize the beam sizes by convolving 405 GHz observations with the 212 GHz beam and vice versa, since,
from the results presented above, both beams have similar spatial response.

horizontal black line inside the box is the year median. Purple dots are the monthly mean sunspot number, with their error
bars deﬁned as 1 σ. The open circles represent the outliers of the distribution.

The artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) procedure implemented to detect ARs in SST maps is based on an artiﬁcial convo-
lutional neural network (ConvNet, Cire¸san et al. 2011; O’Shea & Nash 2015) composed of four convolutional layers
and two fully connected layers. Every convolutional layer has one max pooling and one ﬂattening layer. Including the
input layer, the neural network has a total of 13 layers used to classify every map in 11 diﬀerent categories. There
is only one category representing a map with one or more ARs. To train the ConvNet we use data augmentation
techniques (Bishop 2006; Goodfellow et al. 2016; Aloysius et al. 2017) to increase the size of the test data. We achieve
≈ 97 % and ≈ 98 % accuracy for testing and validation, respectively. The method reliability is increased by comparing
SST maps with 17 GHz images from the NoRH what should conﬁrm the presence of the AR. Maps with detected ARs
are binarized : a black (1) or white (0) pixel means it does or does not belong to an AR. The AR is extracted from
the map using the Canny algorithm (Canny 1986), and its physical properties: position, size and maximum excess
brightness temperature are automatically included in a data base for later analysis. More than 16,000 maps between
March 2001 and December 2017 are analyzed. Observing times are restricted to the Sun meridian transit (14:00 -
16:00 UTC) to reduce the atmospheric interference. Details of the methodology can be found in Garcia Pereira et al.
(2020), along with preliminary statistical analysis.

In this work we concentrate in the AR excess brightness temperature ∆Tb with respect to the quiet Sun, i.e. the
maximum temperature of the AR with respect to the quiet Sun. Since SST has beams with sizes of the order of
a typical AR size, we do not have spatial resolution to discriminate diﬀerent zones of the AR, and ∆Tb represents
the average over the whole region weighted by the telescope beams. Table 1 summarizes the observations. For every
year and month, a mark x and/or o indicates that ARs are detected at 212 or 405 GHz; at the end of each line we
show the total number of detected ARs during the year and the yearly median of ∆Tb, the super- and underscript
are the diﬀerences to the third and ﬁrst quartiles of the sample, respectively. The absence of marks means either
there are no observations or that no AR is detected. During some years (2003, 2004 and 2008) technical problems
temporarily stopped or reduced observations. On the other hand, it can be seen that there are more ARs detected at
212 GHz than at 405 GHz, an expected result since the opacity is much higher at 405 GHz. Another remark from the
table is that from mid May to mid October (Winter time) when the atmospheric humidity is lower we detect more ARs.

3.1. Excess Brightness Temperature Time Evolution

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the AR excess brightness temperature ∆Tb for the two SST observing frequencies
in the form of boxplots. Every box represents one year of observations, the central, horizontal black line is the median;
the lower (upper) limit of the box is the ﬁrst (third) quartile, and the vertical line extends from the minimum to the
maximum; the open circles represent the outliers of the distribution. Golden boxes represent results for 212 GHz while
green boxes for 405 GHz. The purple dots are the monthly mean values of the sunspot number (SSN) obtained from
the Sunspot Index and Longterm Solar Observations (SILSO) which is an activity of the Solar Inﬂuences Data Analysis
Center (SDIC) of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. The error bars correspond to 1 σ for the month. We can see
that ∆Tb at the two frequencies follow the solar cycle represented by the SSN. The overall cross correlation coeﬃcients

Table 1. Summary of AR observations. The symbol x (o) represents one or more ARs detected at 212 (405) GHz during
the month. No symbol means either no detection or no observation. The columns labeled Total show the total number of
ARs detected during the year, and the last two columns give median ∆Tb for the year with the ± uncertainties deﬁned as the
diﬀerence to the third quartile (superscript) and ﬁrst quartile (subscript) of the sample.

Figure 3. Green dots are the monthly median of the spectral index α, with error bars representing 1 σ. No error bar means
only one measurement. Purple circles are the monthly sunspot number.

between the annual median ∆Tb and the annual mean sunspot number are R = 0.88 for 212 GHz and R = 0.74 for 405
GHz; but if we restrict to the years 2009 and 2017, R = 0.93 and 0.81 for 212 and 405 GHz, respectively. One reason
why R increases after 2009 is that the antenna was in commissioning during almost the ﬁrst decade after installation in
1999. During 2008, in particular, we detected ARs during three months only, resulting in a small sample that produces
a signiﬁcant increase in the uncertainty (see the boxplot for 405 GHz in Figure 2). On the contrary, after 2009, we
observe that boxplots are smaller, an indication of a narrow data dispersion.

From ∆Tb we can derive the spectral index α deﬁned as

boxplot of the sample; both ways graphically show the rather symmetric distribution with a mean value (cid:104)α(cid:105) = 0.16
and median αmed = 0.05; implying that the sample dispersion is related to random noise. On the other hand, the
overall cross correlation coeﬃcient R = −0.25 is consistent with an apparent slight anti-correlation observed in Figure 3.

4. DISCUSSION

Previous works with better spatial resolution have shown that at submillimeter wavelengths the sunspot umbra
is cooler than the quiet Sun, while the penumbra has a similar temperature and the surrounding plage is much
hotter (Lindsey & Kopp 1995; Loukitcheva et al. 2017; Iwai et al. 2017). However, SST beam sizes, which are of
the same order of the AR, cannot resolve these spatial variations and ∆Tb is an average over the whole region, with
the penumbra and surrounding plages dominating the emission, i.e. what we are determining is the variation of the
umbra + penumbra + plage temperature averaged by the beam size along the solar cycle. Valle Silva et al. (2020)
have shown that there are many ARs observed at submillimeter wavelengths without a spot, as it was previously seen
by Selhorst et al. (2014) at cm-wavelength. We also note that, since we use the quiet Sun as a calibrator, and we
assume that the quiet Sun brightness temperature does not change with the cycle, the absolute ∆Tb may be diﬀerent
at diﬀerent phases of the cycle if this hypothesis is not correct. However, even if the quiet Sun temperature changes
during the cycle, ∆Tb variations are real.

Cycles 23 and 24 were double peaked with an evident gap in between them (see Gnevyshev 1967), Figure 2 shows
this behavior for the SSN. SST started observations in 2001, during the recovery from the Gnevyshev gap that was
relatively fast and took less than a year for the SSN. Therefore, it is not possible to identify the gap in the ∆Tb
time-series. In Cycle 24, the gap between peaks occurred between 2012-2013, which is not apparent in the ∆Tb time-
series. We cannot, however, draw any ﬁrm conclusion about this point, since SST data are limited by the atmospheric
attenuation and beam sizes that reduce the detected AR peak temperature, which may create false-negatives. For this
reason we present only one year average values. We are working now in an enhanced AI method to increase the AR
detectability in the SST data.

As it was already pointed out, Selhorst et al. (2014) have shown the correlation between the ARs brightness tem-
perature and the solar cycle at 17 GHz. This is an expected result at this frequency due to the emergence of ARs
with strong magnetic ﬁelds (|B| (cid:62) 2200 G at the photosphere, Vourlidas et al. 2006). These ARs may present gyro-
resonance contribution, that is able to increase their brightness temperatures from 2 − 3 × 104 K to values as high as
TB > 105 K, if the 17 GHz gyro-resonance third harmonic (2000 G) occurs above the transition region (Shibasaki et al.
1994; Vourlidas et al. 2006). However, within solar conditions, the same mechanism does not apply at submillimeter
wavelengths. The millimeter to submillimeter emission is mostly a thermal continuum produced at chromospheric

height in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE, e.g. Loukitcheva et al. 2017). Instead of the ﬂux density, as it was
used in previous works and which depends on the brightness temperature and the source solid angle, here we only use
the brightness temperature to characterize the spectrum, reducing the uncertainty of the spectral index. Indeed, after
the propagation of temperature uncertainties in Equation (1), the α uncertainty is

∆2α =

(cid:18) ∂α

(cid:19)2

∂∆Tb405

∆2(∆Tb405) +

(cid:18) ∂α

(cid:19)2

∂∆Tb212
(cid:19)2

∆2(∆Tb405)

(cid:18)

∆(∆Tb212)

where ∆(∆Tb405) and ∆(∆Tb212) are the total uncertainties in excess brightness temperatures for 405 and
212 GHz, respectively, while εr405 and εr212 are their relative uncertainties and Q = 1/ log(405/212). Substitut-
ing εr405 = εr212 ≈ 0.1 in Equation (2) we get ∆α ≈ 0.22, a value which agrees with Figure 4 and reinforces our
conclusion that the dispersion is produced by random noise. Therefore, we are very cautious to draw any conclusion
about the anti-correlation between α and the SSN given by the coeﬃcient R = −0.25. The spectral index α obtained
here represents the average source properties, encompassing plages, penumbra and umbra from one or more sunspots;
however, we note that the spectrum of an AR can be well represented by a unique spectral index from 34 GHz to
405 GHz when the spatial resolution is of order 1 arcmin (Silva et al. 2005; Valle Silva et al. 2020) lending support to
the optically thick emission of a thermal source.

The temporal variation of ∆Tb has to be also interpreted in terms of an average value. The evolution of an active
region is modulated by the magnetic ﬁeld; it is the magnetic energy dissipated the one that should heat the plasma.
As a solar cycle progresses the dissipated magnetic energy should increase or decrease following it, and therefore, the
active region average temperature should follow the cycle. However, to conﬁrm this hypothesis, a statistical study
relating the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld and ∆Tb should be accomplished.
