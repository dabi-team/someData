Abstract: 

Nowadays,  making  thermoelectric  materials  more  efficient  in  energy  conversion  is  still  a 
challenge.  In  this  work,  to  reduce  the  thermal  conductivity  and  thus  improve  the  overall 
thermoelectric performances, point and extended defects were generated in epitaxial 111-ScN 
thin films by implantation using argon ions. The films were investigated by structural, optical, 
electrical,  and  thermoelectric  characterization  methods.  The  results  demonstrated  that  argon 
implantation leads to the formation of stable defects (up to 750 K operating temperature). These 
were identified as interstitial type defect clusters and so-called argon-vacancy complexes. The 
insertion of those specific defects induces acceptor-type deep levels in the bandgap yielding to 
a  reduce  of  the  free  carrier  mobility.  With  a  reduced  electrical  conductivity,  the  irradiated 
sample exhibited higher Seebeck coefficient while maintaining the power factor of the film. 
The thermal conductivity is strongly reduced  from 12 to 3 W.m-1.K-1 at 300 K, showing the 
influence of defects in increasing phonon scattering. Subsequent high temperature annealing, 
at 1573 K, leads to the progressive evolution of those defects: the initial clusters of interstitials 
evolved to the benefit of smaller clusters and the formation of bubbles. Thus, the number of 
free carriers, the resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient are almost restored but the mobility of 
the carriers remains low and a 30% drop in thermal conductivity is still effective (ktotal  8.5 
W.m-1.K-1). This study shows that the control defect  engineering with defects introduced by 
irradiation using noble gases in a thermoelectric coating can be an attractive method to enhance 
the figure of merit of thermoelectric materials.

1 - INTRODUCTION 

Defects,  inevitable  in  materials,  are  classified  as  point  defects  (vacancy,  interstitial, 

impurity), linear (dislocation), planar (stacking fault, grain boundary) and volumetric defects 

(from nanocavity up to microcrack). They are known to influence properties of materials by 

themselves and by interacting with each other. Some specific defects can also be introduced 

deliberately,  particularly  after  the  material  has  been  subjected  to  irradiation/implantation  or 

plastic  deformation.  For  use,  impurities  are  introduced  into  semiconductors  to  tailor  their 

electrical conductivity 𝜎. On the contrary in metals such impurities can reduce the conductivity 

by  acting  as  obstacles  for  a  smooth  carrier  flow  and  play  a  key  role  in  extrinsic  phonon 

scattering in lowering the thermal conductivity ktotal. The ion implantation technique in which 

specific elements can be selected and then accelerated toward a target material is widely used 

in  several  fields  as  the  microelectronic  industry,  the  surface  modification  or  to  simulate  the 

behavior of materials under harsh environment (nuclear applications). The process results in 

the generation of a large concentration of Frenkel pairs via the collision cascades, which tend 

to recombine and/or condense to form various type of defects depending on the experimental 

conditions  such  as  the  species  of  implanted  atoms,  the  fluence,  the  incident  energy  and  the 

thermal budget. An advantage of ion implantation is that the as-induced changes in physical 

properties can be manipulated repeatedly which makes it a suitable technique for dealing with 

the transport properties of thin film thermoelectric (TE) materials. Indeed, the efficiency of a 
TE-material to convert heat to electricity is governed by its figure of merit 𝑍𝑇 = 𝑆2𝜎𝑇/𝑘𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙, 

where  T  is  the  absolute  operating  temperature,  S  the  Seebeck  coefficient,     the  electrical 

conductivity  and  ktotal  the  thermal  conductivity  being  the  sum  of  the  lattice  and  electronic 

thermal  conductivity  (𝑘𝑙𝑎𝑡 + 𝑘𝑒).  The  nanoscale  defects  generated  by  implantation  (may  be 

followed  by  high  temperature  annealing)  could  be  used  as  a  scattering  means  for  short 

wavelength phonons leading to a reduction of   𝑘𝑙𝑎𝑡. Besides, defects are currently seen as a 
promising  way  forward  in  a  strategy  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  TE-materials.1  Vacancy 

engineering strategy has been used to create dislocations in PbTe for reducing the lattice thermal 

conductivity.2 Similarly, introduction of excess Cu atoms in CuSe thin films reduces the Cu-

vacancies and introduces additional scattering centers, increasing the ZT.3 It should be noted 

that  other  strategies  for  enhancing  ZT  have  been  developed  as  for  example  the  quantum 

confinement,4,5 the use of antisite defects in ZrNiSn half-Heusler alloys or incorporation nano-

inclusions in the TE matrix.6,7 The controlled introduction of nanoscale defects by using ion 

2 

 
 
implantation  can  also  be  part  of  the  strategies  to  scatter  phonons  reducing  the  thermal 

conductivity in thin film TE-materials.  

This ion beam technique has recently been used in TE-films to modify the electronic 

transport  properties  in  relation  with  the  microstructural  modifications.  For  example,  the  S+ 

implantation  in  Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3  increases  the  thermoelectric  power  factor,  𝑃𝐹 = 𝑆2𝜎,  via  the 

generation of carriers due to the TeBi antisites.8 Similarly, the N implantation in SrTiO3 creates 

mainly oxygen vacancies acting as carrier donors while decreasing the grain size leading to an 

enhancement of PF value.9 In CoSb3 the Fe+ implantation changes the conductivity type due to 

the creation of vacancies and an increase of PF by more than a factor of 10 is reported.10 All 

these authors highlight the defects engineering in the applications of TE-devices by an increase 

of the PF. It should be noted, however, that it is mainly the direct or indirect doping effect that 

is at the origin of the modifications of the electronic properties. These are strongly dependent 

on the implantation conditions, and in particular on the dose. Ion implantation can also lead to 

the formation of distinct phases, as the Ag2Te phases in Ag-implanted PbTe, resulting in an 

increase  in  the  Seebeck  coefficient.11  In  summary,  implantation  in  TE-films  was  used  as  a 

means of controlling charge carrier properties but not as a means of introducing lattice defects 

to strength phonon scattering. 

Scandium  nitride  (ScN)  is  a  n-type  semiconductor  with  suitable  properties  such  as  a 

high carrier concentration in the range 1018-1022 cm-3 and low electrical resistivity of about 300 

µΩ.cm leading to an appreciable PF of about 3x10-3 Wm-1K-2 at 600 K.12,13 However, due to its 

high thermal conductivity, the overall ZT is limited, in the range 0.2-0.3.13-15 The total thermal 

conductivity, mainly dominated by the lattice conductivity klat,16 is found to be in the range 10-

12  Wm-1K-1  at  room  temperature  (RT)  and  decreases  with  increasing  temperature  due  to 

Umklapp  scattering  (7-8  Wm-1K-1  at  500  K).15  Attempts  were  made  to  reduce  the  thermal 

conductivity by alloy scattering such as the introduction of Nb (10 at. %) which leaded to a 

large decrease of the thermal conductivity, down to 2.2 Wm-1K-1 but deteriorated the Seebeck 

effect.17  More  recently  it  has  been  shown  that  defect  introduction  by  using  Mg-dopant 

implantation  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  Seebeck  coefficient  coupled  with  a  drop  in  thermal 

conductivity ktotal, down to 3.2 Wm-1K-1 for the ScN sample implanted with 2.2 at. % of Mg.18 

Another study has shown the potential on Li+-implanted ScN for which the thermal conductivity 

is divided by half in the 300-700K temperature range.19 Defect engineering by ion implantation 

and  other  techniques  have  shown  potential  for  improving  of  thermoelectric  properties. 

However, the control of the induced defect in a material is always challenge in terms of their 

3 

 
formation  during  irradiation/implantation,  the  type  of  defect,  and  their  stability  with 

temperature which is critical for thermoelectric applications.  

The underlined idea of the present work is to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, 

klat, of ScN by introducing a network of lattice defects (acting as phonons scattering centers) 

via the ion implantation while trying to keep the power factor constant and thereby improve the 

ZT value. To promote the introduction of defects and minimize the chemical doping effects of 

the  implanted  species,  a  heavy  noble  gas,  argon,  was  implanted  in  the  ScN  thin  films.  The 

effects  of  post  implantation  annealing  up  to  1573  K  were  also  investigated  to  discuss  the 

implantation-induced defects evolution in relation to changes in thermoelectric properties. In 

many  materials,  metals  and  semiconductors,20,21  the  interaction  of  gas  atom  with  excess 

vacancies  leads  to  the  formation  of  nanoscale  bubbles  that  can  turn  into voids  if  desorption 

takes  place  under  subsequent  high  temperature  annealing.  Results  show  that  these  Ar-

implantation  induced-defects  modify  the  physical  properties  of  ScN  films  by  reducing  the 

thermal conductivity while maintaining roughly constant the power factor, thus showing their 

potential for improving ZT.  

2 - MATERIAL and METHODS 

<111> degenerate n-type ScN thin films (thickness  240nm) were deposited using dc 

reactive  magnetron  sputtering  onto  Al2O3  (c-cut)  substrates  maintained  at  a  temperature  of 

800°C (for more details on the growth conditions see13). The thin films were then implanted 

with  argon ions,  Ar2+, at  room temperature using the implanter EATON  VN3206 at  Pprime 

Institute (Poitiers). The depth profiles of the displaced atoms and implanted ions in the ScN 

films (density of 4.29 g/cm3) were calculated using the SRIM 2013 software under the full-

damage cascade mode.22 To introduce a constant quantity of damage (called displacements per 

atom: dpa) along the thickness of the film, a multi-implantation protocol was designed. Three 

implantations with decreasing incident energies of 320 keV (projected ion mean range Rp  200 

nm with straggling Rp  60 nm), 160 keV (Rp  100 nm and Rp  35 nm) and 50 keV (Rp  

35 nm and Rp 15 nm) were carried out with fluences of 3.5x1015, 1x1015 and 1x1015 cm-2, 

respectively. These relevant fluences were chosen to implant the ScN film in the called high 

damage regime, i.e. 5-6 dpa, for which a previous study showed the impact of defects on thermal 

conductivity is the most significant.18 Fig.1 shows the resulting damage distribution (dpa) and 

4 

 
 
 
argon concentration. As seen, the dpa-profile is rather flat in the entire ScN film, around 5 dpa, 

while the argon concentration is bumpy in the range 0.1 − 0.3 𝑎𝑡. % and extends deep into the 

substrate. During implantation, the current beam density was kept below 5 µA.cm-2 to avoid 

any  temperature  increase.  SRIM  calculations  which  do  not  consider  any  dynamic 

recombination, result in a vacancies/ion ratio of 840 (for a given energy of 50 keV) showing 

that the defect formation is promoted over the effects of the implanted impurity. Subsequent 

annealing at 1573 K were conducted in a home-made lamp furnace under ambient atmosphere. 

The rate of heating was about 20°C/min and the annealing duration of 10 min. 

Figure 1 : (a) Displacement per atom (dpa) and (b) Ar concentration profiles as function of depth calculated by 
using the SRIM code. The ScN film was implanted with 320-160-50 keV Ar-ions at fluences of 3.5x1015, 1x1015 
and 1x1015 cm-2 respectively to obtain a flat damage profile of around 5 dpa throughout the film (grey). 

The macroscopic in-plane resistivity ρ(T) and mobility µ(T) were measured using by the 

van der Pauw method coupled with Hall effect (ECOPIA HMS-5000). Two cryostats were used: 

a low temperature cryostat, from 80 to 350 K and a high temperature cryostat, from 300 to 750 

5 

 
 
 
 
K. All these measurements were performed using a constant magnetic field up to 0.580 Tesla. 

The rate of temperature increase during measurements was close to 3 °C min-1.  

Optical measurements were carried out by using a J. A. Woollam M2000XI ellipsometer 

in  the  range  0.2-1.7µm.  Ellipsometric  data  were  acquired  at  55°,  65°  and  75°  angles  of 

incidence. To determine the optical properties, a three-oscillator model was developed using 

the J. A. Woollam CompleteEase software: a Tauc−Lorentz oscillator (TLO) centered close to 

2.4 eV modelling the direct band gap absorption of ScN; a Gaussian oscillator (GO) arbitrarily 

centered out of the measurement range at 7 eV to model all UV interband transitions; and a 

Drude oscillator (DO) modelling the free-carrier optical behavior in the NIR range. The optical 

properties of the Al2O3 substrate were modelled using the optical constants available in the J. 

A. Woollam database. 

XRD measurements were performed on a four-circle diffractometer (Seifert Space XRD 

TS-4) with a Cu X-ray source using a 0.5 mm collimator and a Meteor0D detector. The residual 

stress was analyzed using the sin² Ψ-method, which relies on the use of lattice plane spacing 

dhkl as an internal strain gauge. Along a given direction (Ψ, Φ), where Ψ is the angle between 

the surface normal and the normal to (hkl) planes and Φ is the azimuthal angle, the measured 

lattice strain 𝜀𝛹,𝛷 , is given by: 

𝜀𝜓,𝜙 =  

𝑎𝜓,𝜙−𝑎0
𝑎0

                 (1) 

where a0 is the stress-free lattice parameter and 𝑎𝛹,𝛷  is the lattice parameter determined from 

a given {hkl} reflection. The a0 parameter is generally unknown and might differ significantly 

from the 𝑎𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘  parameter, preventing a direct determination of the strain. 

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data were acquired using a TALOS F200S 

Thermofisher microscope operating at 200 kV. Slices, with a thickness of about 300 μm, were 

cut from the bulk sample. They were then pre-thinned up to a thickness of approximately 20 

μm by mechanical polishing and glued onto a copper grid. Finally, ion thinning down to electron 

transparency was performed by means of a Precision Ion Polishing System (Gatan-PIPS). A 

TEM thin foil was also extracted by focused ion beam (FIB) Helios G3 CX - from Thermofisher 

Dual Beam. The lamella was cut perpendicular to the basal plane, and was about 12 µm long, 

4 µm wide and 80 nm thick (approximate values). 

6 

 
 
The  in-plane  Seebeck  coefficient  and  the  electrical  resistivity  were  measured 

simultaneously under a low-pressure helium atmosphere using ULVAC-RIKO ZEM3 from RT 

up to 680 K.  

Thermal conductivity measurements were performed at room temperature by Frequency 

Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR) setup. This technique is non-contact  and nondestructive 

optical methods. The measurement of the temperature oscillation induced by the absorption of 

an intense modulated laser beam (pump) allows its thermal characterization. A thin metallic 

film (Aluminum, 67 nm) was deposited on top of the sample to confine the heat absorption and 

to sense the surface temperature by its reflectance change. The modulated CW pump laser is 

focused on top of the surface of the sample. The absorbed energy induces a periodic temperature 

change.  A  second  CW  laser  beam  (probe)  overlaps  the  heating  area  and  is  reflected  to  a 

photodiode.  The  relative  variation  of  the  probe  intensity  (

)  is  detected  with  a  lock-in 

amplifier synchronized on the pump frequency. The pump frequency (f) is swept from a few 

kHz up to 100 MHz and the best fit of the spectral response is then performed with multilayered 

model.  The  thermal  conductivity  (ktotal),  the  heat  capacity  (CTH)  and  the  thermal  contact 

resistance (Rcontact) are thus obtained.

Figure 2 shows a ω-2 (off set 0.2°) XRD scan of the as-deposited ScN thin film on 

sapphire  substrate.  The  peak  observed  at  34.5°  is  identified  as  (111)  ScN  with  a  lattice 

parameter of 4.50 Å, in good agreement with ICCD PDF 00-045-0978 (ScN). The inset shows 

the ϕ scan at azimuthal angle Ψ = 70.5° for ScN {111}. The presence of six peaks shows that 

ScN thin film grows epitaxially with the [111] out of plane direction and the presence of twin 

domains usually observed for the growth of cubic material system on c-plane sapphire.13,23 

  Figure 3 compares the diffraction peaks of the 333-diffraction peak for the as-deposited 

(reference),  implanted  and  annealed  ScN  samples.  Even  present  at  high  2θ  angle,  the  333 

reflection was chosen to observe more clearly any changes (shift, shapes intensity) compared 

to  other  lll  reflection.  As  seen,  the  reference  sample  exhibits  the  two  peaks  from  the  non-

monochromatic X-ray source (Kα1 and Kα2) showing the good crystallinity of the film. After 

implantation, a large drop in intensity is observed and the Kα1 and Kα2 split is no longer visible, 

suggesting a drastic change of the structure. The FWHM is also strongly enlarged meaning that 

the local strain heterogeneities are increased by the implantation. A shift towards the lower 2ϴ 

angles is observed indicating that the interplanar distance d333 is expended by the implantation. 

The subsequent annealing at high temperature (1573 K) results in the partial restoration of the 

structure of the sample.  

Figure 3: -2 X-ray diffraction pattern of ScN (333) peak after different steps of investigation of samples (reference, Ar-
implanted and annealed at 1573 K). 

The  effect  of  implantation  induced  damage  was  studied  by  quantifying  the  residual 

stresses applied to the film. The planes, not parallel to the surface, 333̅  were studied (at Ψ of 

8 

 
 
 
 
70.53°)  and  compared  to  the  333  reflection;  the  data  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  For  the 

reference sample, the inter-planar distances are almost equal between the growth direction and 

the  in-plane  direction  showing  that  no  (or  few)  residual  stress  is  present.  On  the  contrary, 

implanted, and annealed samples have different values of 𝑑333 and 𝑑333̅. After implantation, 

𝑑333 > 𝑑333̅ implies that the film undergoes compressive stress due to its expansion after the 

ion implantation. The same conclusion can be drawn from the stress values evaluated from the 

“sin² Ψ-method”. The stress obtained after implantation is negative, showing the drastic change 

in the structure and the induced compressive stress. After annealing, the residual stress is found 

to  be  positive  and  the  relation  𝑑333  <  𝑑333̅  is  observed  indicating  a  strong  recovery  of  the 

damage and thus a partial restoration of the film structure. However, the value of the residual 

stress is higher and lead to a compressive stress compared to the one from the reference film, 

suggesting that annealing has indeed restored the structure and in addition to recombination, a 

defect evolution has occurred during high temperature annealing.

The analysis of the optical properties (refractive index n and extinction coefficient k) of 

conductive materials gives access to local electrical properties, i.e., the in-grain mobility and 

carrier density.24 Figure 4 shows the variation of the optical extinction coefficient k versus the 

incident  wavelength.  The  curve  of  the  reference  ScN  sample  shows  different  domains:  a 

transparent region from 500 to 900 nm in-between two absorbing regions the inter- and intra-

band absorptions. These wavelength ranges are in good agreement with those already measured 

and calculated using density functional calculations onto single crystal ScN on MgO (001).25,26 

Starting at 900 nm, the curve is representative of the Drude’s model suggesting a behavior-like 

metallic character of ScN. By using an effective electron mass of 0.40m0 the mobility inside the 

grain  at  RT  has  been  determined  to  be  𝜇𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛
concentration of about 2.1x1021 cm-3.25 After implantation, the k-curve is drastically altered in 

𝑟𝑒𝑓 (𝑅𝑇) ~ 35 cm2V−1s−1  and  the  carrier 

agreement  with  XRD (figure  3). The transparent domain has  disappeared, and the electrical 

nature of the film is nearly lost due to the as-introduced defects preventing any Drude analysis 

and thus any determination of the electrical properties. The subsequent annealing at 1573 K 

9 

 
 
leads to the recovery of the optical constants and the sample tends to recover its initial color. 

The  carrier  concentration  is  found  to  be  fully  restored  in  contrast  to  the  mobility  which  is 

estimated to be 𝜇𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛

1573𝐾(𝑅𝑇) ~ 28 𝑐𝑚2𝑉−1𝑠−1. The optical measurements confirmed that some 

defects are still present within the ScN grains even after annealing. 

Figure 4: Extinction coefficient k of ScN film at different steps of the process: reference, Ar-implantation and annealed at 
1573K. The optical appearance of the film is presented on the right side. 

Figure 5 shows the TEM analysis of the ScN reference sample along with the implanted 

and the implanted/annealed one. Figure 5(a) is an overview cross-section TEM image of typical 

ScN  film.  Columnar  domains  are  visible  highlighting  the  highly  textured  polycrystalline 

character  of  the  film.  A  thickness  of  240  nm  can  be  estimated  from  the  image,  in  good 

agreement  with  the  X-Ray  Reflectometry  (XRR)  measurements.  After  implantation,  the 

implanted zone is clearly visible, figure 5(b). This zone comprises black contrast dots uniformly 

distributed  up  to  a  depth  of  about  300  nm,  in  agreement  with  the  SRIM  simulations 

(superimposed in the figure). These small dots cannot be resolved individually and suggest the 

formation of clusters of defects (interstitials). No other type of defects is observed. EDX-STEM 

mapping shows the presence of dispersed argon in the film and beyond into the substrate as 

expected from SRIMS simulations (Fig. 1).  

The  TEM image,  Fig.  5(c),  attests to  a change of the microstructure happening  after 

annealing at high temperature 1573 K on an ion implanted sample. Firstly, there is the formation 

of large argon-filled cavities (bubbles evidenced by EDS data) as well as dislocations in the 

implanted  area  of  the  substrate  (inset  (i)).  Most  bubbles  are  faceted  along  basal  planes;  the 

others, larger ones, are rather spherical. These observations are similar to those obtained after 

helium implantation performed on Al2O3 single crystal.27 In the ScN film the microstructure 

10 

 
 
looks different. There are less black contrast dots than before annealing revealing the columnar 

structure of the film is still preserved despite all the process. Bubbles in the ScN film are also 

observed,  but  they  are  heterogeneously  distributed.  Most  appear  spherical  and  small,  a  few 

nanometers  in  size  (inset  (iii)),  while  some  defects  with  a  more  elongated  shape  are  highly 

dispersed and can reach 30-40 nm (inset (ii)). It would also appear that many bubbles are present 

at the film/substrate interface resulting in an almost bubble-free zone of about 50nm inside the 

film, see the inset (i) in figure 5(d).

3.2 - PHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION 

Figure 6 : Resistivity (a) and mobility (b) as function of temperature of the reference, Ar-implanted and annealed ScN thin 
films. 

The  electrical  resistivity  measurements  are  plotted  in  figure  6(a)  in  the  operating 

temperature range 80-750 K. All curves show a similar appearance characteristic of metallic-

like behavior. With increasing temperature, the electrical resistivity exhibits a constant value 

from  80  K  up  to  150  K  approximately,  and  then  a  linear  positive  rise.  The  absence  of  any 

thermally activated transport at low temperature suggests an electrical resistivity controlled by 

impurities and the as-grown crystal defects. In the linear region (T0 > 150 K) the resistivity can 

be given by the following relation: 

𝜌(𝑇) = 𝜌𝑅 + 𝛼(𝑇 − 𝑇0) +   𝜌𝐷                 (2) 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
with 𝜌𝑅 the residual resistivity and 𝜌𝐷 the implantation-induced resistivity (𝜌𝐷
the slope of curves 2.2x10-7  0.1 Ω.cm.K-1 is found to be constant at any stage of the process 

𝑟𝑒𝑓 = 0). As seen 

meaning  that  the  interaction  electron-phonon  is  not  modified  by  the  implantation-induced 

defects  and  their  evolution  upon  annealing  at  1573  K:  only  𝜌𝐷changes.  For  the  5  dpa-Ar-
𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑑 = 1.25 × 10−3Ω. cm is found to be temperature independent in all the 

implantation 𝜌𝐷
investigated temperature range, no recovery of damage or defects recombination occurs during 

the electrical measurements. This suggests that all the defects produced by the Ar implantation 

are stable up to at least 750 K in contrary to what was observed for Mg dopant implantation in 

ScN.18 An annealing at 1573 K restored the electrical resistivity to comparable values as the 

reference film, the value of  𝜌𝐷

𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 is reduced by about 90%.  

Figure 6(b) shows the Hall mobility curves with temperature that helps to understand the carrier 

scattering  mechanism  and  reports  the  average  of  carrier  concentrations.  According  to  the

where  µ𝑙𝑎𝑡 is  the  lattice  mobility,  µ𝑅 the  residual  mobility  and  µ𝐷 the  implantation-induced

reference  sample  decreases  smoothly  with  temperature,  but  more  slowly  than  expected  for 

acoustical lattice scattering for which the relationship is 𝜇𝑙𝑎𝑡(𝑇) ~ 𝑇−1.5 (or 𝑇−1.29 as reported 
in MBE-ScN28). It can be well fitted by adding the carrier scattering by residual impurities (as-
grown  defects  and  grain  boundaries)  taken  as  𝜇𝑅 ~ 23  cm2V-1s-1  for  T  >  150  K.  The  Hall

The  carrier  concentrations  of  samples  are  found  to  be  high  and  independent  of 

temperature which is a typical trait of degenerate semiconductors. The Ar-implantation in this 

highly damaged regime reduced by a factor two the free carrier concentration showing that the 

13 

 
  
 
 
 
 
as-introduced  defects  act  like  traps  for  electrons.  In  contrast,  the  carrier  concentration  was 

almost recovered during annealing (carrier detrapping). However, defects are still present after 

annealing and affect the charge carrier mobility while being no longer electrically active. These 

electrical  measurements  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  optical  characterizations,  namely  a 

fully recovery of the carrier concentration after annealing and a partial recovery of the carrier 

mobility.

and annealed (1573K) samples. 

Seebeck  coefficients  measured  in  the  temperature  range  370-680  K  are  displayed  in 

figure 7. |𝑆| increases linearly with the measuring temperature for all the samples regardless of 

process step. The linear dependence with temperature suggests a constant carrier concentration 

in  agreement with  Hall-effect measurements  (figure  6(b)) At 600 K the  value of  |𝑆| for  the 

reference ScN is 35 µV.K-1 being close to the value previously reported for samples produced 

under similar conditions but lower than the one reported for ScN growth on MgO substrate by 

using MBE.15,18 This low value may be due to the large contamination from impurities acting 

as dopants resulting in the large carrier concentration measured. After implantation, the Seebeck 

coefficient absolute values in the high damage regime increases from 30 to 85 µV.K-1 at 600 

K. As seen the implantation process also increases the slope of the curve by a factor of close to 

three. After annealing at 1573 K, the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient is found to be 

slightly lower than reference value,  28 µV.K-1

 at 600 K, with, however, the slope back to the 

same value. The Seebeck coefficient must therefore be analyzed considering both the number 

of carriers and the presence of defects that change the Density of States (DOS).

Table 2 reports the values of the thermal conductivity of ScN measured at 300 K, the 

heat  capacity  of  the  ScN  thin  film  and  the  interface  thermal  resistance  between  the  top 

aluminum film and the layer of interest. The thermal conductivity value of the reference sample 

is 12.5 W.m-1K-1, in good agreement with the values reported earlier.14,18 After Ar-implantation, 

the sample exhibits a large drop of thermal conductivity down to 3 W.m-1K-1. As previously 

mentioned, annealing process afterwards restored partially the structure and the defects, leading 

a thermal conductivity towards its original value (around 8.5 W.m-1K-1) and highlighting again 

the presence of structural defects even after high temperature annealing. The heat capacity is 

not  affected  by  the  entire  process.  The  contact  thermal  resistance,  increase  slightly  after 

implantation and it recovers a value comparable to the reference sample after annealing. 

4 – DISCUSSION 

The large decrease of thermal conductivity in implanted ScN thin films either with noble 

gas (Ar in this study, see table 2), with dopants (Mg in a previous study) or by non-electrically 

active  element  (Li+)  may  be  explained  by  the  as-introduced  defects  which  reduce  the  mean 

phonons  free  path,  increasing  thus  the  level  of  scattering.18,19  The  increase  of  thermal 

conductivity  occurring  during  the  subsequent  high-temperature  annealing  suggests  a  partial 

recovery  of  defects.  However,  the  Seebeck  curves  and  electrical  characterizations  provide  a 

more complete picture. The implantation defects introduce deep acceptors level in the band gap 

then  reduce  the  concentration  of  free  carriers.  Moreover,  this  should  modify  locally  the 

electronic DOS. For degenerate semiconductors, the Seebeck coefficient is dependent on the 

effective mass of carriers at the Fermi surface.7 Besides, calculations showed that vacancies 

introduce asymmetrical peak close to the Fermi level in the electronic DOS of ScN, resulting 

in an enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient.29,30 As a result, the trapping of carriers and the 

15 

 
 
 
 
modification of the DOS caused by the implantation process led to an increase of both Seebeck 

value  and  slope  (x3  in  the  implanted  sample)  of  the  curve  S(T)  (figure  7),  in  the  whole 

investigated temperature range. This increase in slope is also observed on the previous study 

when implanting Mg-dopants in ScN.18 A higher S(T) slope was reported when measuring the 

thermoelectric properties up to the temperature at which the defects recombination starts to be 

active (any zero-dimensional defects such as the Frenkel pairs); i.e., at 450 K.18 This triggering 

of defect recombination results also in a progressive decrease of electrical resistivity during the 

measurement. This behavior was reported regardless of the concentration of implanted Mg.  

In  the  present  paper,  no  change  in  slope  is  observed  when  implanting  argon  at  high 

fluence  (figure  6);  the  Ar-atoms  therefore  operate  as  point  defect  stabilizers  preventing  any 

defect  recombination  (or  damage  recovery)  at  least  up  to  a  temperature  of  750  K  (see  the 

electrical  resistivity  and  Seebeck  curves  Fig.  2  and  3,  no  modifications  occur  during 

temperature range). Noble gas (NG) atoms are known to behave singularly when implanted in 

materials.20 Because of their low solubility in materials, they tend to aggregate resulting in the 

formation of NG-extended defect such as cavities or highly pressurized bubbles in fluid or in 

solid  form  depending  on  implantations  conditions.31  Electronic  structure  calculations  in  SiC 

and  Si  showed  that  the  trapping  of  argon  (as  other  heavy  gases)  by  mono-  or  divacancy  is 

energetically favorable.32,33 Implanted argon atoms in ScN are thus expected to be trapped by 

the  supersaturation  of  vacancies  introduced  by  the  collision  cascades.  Thus,  during  the 

implantation  process,  many  interstitials  recombine  with  vacancies  (dynamical  annealing)  or 

combine  with  other  to  form  interstitial  clusters  that  appears  as  black  spots  damage  in  TEM 

(figure  5(a)).  All  the  remaining  vacancies  trap  the  argon  atoms  to  form  argon-vacancies 

complexes,  ArnVm  with  m>n.  Up  to  750  K  neither  the  interstitials  clusters  nor  the  ArnVm 

complexes have sufficient energy to dissociate and no change in the slopes of the Seebeck and 

resistivity curves is reported with the measuring temperature (figures 6 and 7).  

All these defects contribute predominantly to scatter the free carriers and therefore to 

reduce drastically the electrical mobility. After annealing, the recovery of the Seebeck slope 

shows  the  removing  of  the  DOS  changes  caused  by  the  implantation.  The  values  of  |𝑆|  are 

however slightly lower than in the reference sample, highlighting the change in type of defects. 

Moreover,  this  evolution  is  coupled  with  a  change  in  the  stress  state  of  the  film  from 

compressive to tensile. 

16 

 
The different as-introduced defects, have an influence on the mobility of free carriers 

by reducing their free mean path. The black dots damage observed after implantation suggests 

that the primary knock-on-atoms go on to generate collision cascades in which Frenkel pairs 

are formed. Probably due to the low migration energies if many interstitials recombine with 

vacancies others combine to form clusters appearing as black spot damage on the TEM image, 

figure 5(b). According to the temperature of subsequent annealing such clusters have sufficient 

energy to dissociate giving rise to a lower density of larger black-spots as seen in figure 5(c) 

when  compared  to  figure  5(b).  The  continuous  recovery  of  the  resistivity  with  annealing 

suggests a size dependence of the dissociation energies of the clusters. The role of Ar-gas leads 

to the stabilization of vacancy-type defects as cavities (bubbles or voids) are observed before 

annealing. Upon annealing, the TEM observations suggest that some of the (ArnVm) complexes 

dissociate/migrate to other complexes until they form visible bubbles. However, their formation 

and  growth  appear  to  be  the  result  of  a  combination  of  several  factors  including  stresses 

evolution, film structure (as the presence of grains) and  defect mobility resulting in a rather 

heterogenous distribution of bubbles in the film. As an example, the growth of bubbles in SiC 

is  found  to  be  enhanced  on  grain  boundaries.34  In  ScN,  by  applying  Matthiessen’s  rules  to 

optical and Hall mobilities at RT, the mobility due to grain boundaries is found to be reduced 

after implantation and annealing from 𝜇𝐺𝐵
This shows that the grain boundary scattering is not neglectable for carrier mobility and that an 

𝑟𝑒𝑓(𝑅𝑇) ~ 35 cm2V−1s−1 to 𝜇𝐺𝐵

1573𝐾 ~ 13 cm2V−1s−1. 

accumulation  of  defects  also  occurs  on  the  grain  boundaries  during  the  1573K  annealing. 

Similarly, the interface (14% lattice mismatch) appears to act as a sink for bubbles formation. 

TEM observations are still in progress to obtain a clearer picture. All these defects will therefore 

influence the transport properties of ScN. 

Combining the Seebeck and electrical conductivity values the power factor at 600 K for 

the reference sample is found to be about 5x10-4 Wm-1K2. This value is relatively low compared 

to the previous studies on as-grown and Mg-implanted ScN due to the quality of the film;13,14,18 

i.e.,  the  unwanted  dopant  impurities  introduced  during  the  film  synthesis  as  the  amount  of 

oxygen  or  fluorine.  The  quality  of  the  ScN  film  is  a  critical  factor  in  improving  its 

thermoelectric properties. While implantation damage leads to a strong increase in the value of 

the Seebeck coefficient, it also strongly reduces the electrical conductivity, which in turn has 

no or few effects on the calculated value of the power factor, 5x10-4 Wm-1K2. On the contrary, 

the damage induces a strong reduction in thermal conductivity which is beneficial for improving 

the thermoelectric figure of merit of ScN, and these defects are stable to at least 750 K. Post 

17 

 
implantation annealing results in an evolution of defects leading to a de-trapping of free carriers 

but  these  defects  (interstitials  clusters,  bubbles,  vacancies-gas  complexes:  3D-defects)  still 

affect the mobility and also reduce the thermal conductivity which was the purpose of this study. 

Then, knowing that the types of defects are strongly dependent on the implantation and post-

processing  conditions,  these  must  be  optimized  to  find  the  best  balance  between  all  the 

interrelated parameters (S,  and ktotal). 

5 - CONCLUSIONS 

Argon implantation at room temperature in a high regime of damage (5-6 dpa) was carried out 

on ScN thin film to introduce defects in order to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity.  All 

implantation defects created are stable up to a minimum operating temperature of 750K: the 

use of argon therefore stabilizes implantation induced-defects. These defects act as carrier traps, 

reduce their mobility and also have a strong effect on the thermoelectric properties of ScN. In 

particular, the thermal conductivity is found to be reduced by a factor of four while keeping the 

PF constant. Post implantation annealing at high temperature restores the crystallinity of the 

ScN structure and the number of free carriers but also leads to the formation of nanosized 3D-

defects which both affect carrier mobility and phonon scattering. However, these defects have 

a detrimental effect on the power factor showing that the thermoelectric properties are strongly 

dependent on the size, morphology, and type of defects. 

Thus,  this  study  shows  that  the  controlled  introduction  of  defects,  or  the  defect 

engineering (via noble gas implantation for thin films), can be used as a strategy to introduce 

additional phonon scattering centers that is beneficial for the development of TE-materials.
