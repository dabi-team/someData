Abstract. Marsh et al. (2016) have recently reported the discovery of a radio-pulsing
white dwarf in the cataclysmic variable AR Sco. The period of pulsations which are also
seen in the optical and UV is about 117 seconds. High intensity of pulsing radiation and
non-thermal character of its spectrum leave little room for doubt that the white dwarf
in AR Sco operates as a spin-powered pulsar and, therefore, is in the ejector state. We
show that this system is very much resembling a well-known object AE Aqr. In both
systems the compact components are spin-powered and have relatively strong surface
magnetic ﬁeld of order of 100-500 MG. They originated due to accretion spin-up in the
previous epoch during which the magnetic ﬁeld of the white dwarf had substantially
evolved being initially buried by the accreted matter and recovered to its initial value
after the spin-up phase had ended.

Introduction

∼

∼

Information about unique properties of AR Sco has been published quite recently (Marsh
et al. 2016) and immediately excited much interest. This is a close binary with the or-
3.56 h containing a red dwarf of spectral type M and a white dwarf
bital period of
spinning at the period of
117 s. The most peculiar feature of this object is that the
spin period of the white dwarf is increasing so rapidly that its spin-down power exceeds
the bolometric luminosity of the system emitting electromagnetic radiation from radio
to X-rays. Moreover, the white dwarf is a radio-pulsar as well as a pulsar in the IR,
optical and UV spectral domains. The intensity of pulsed emission in the optical region
exceeds the total emission of the stellar components. The spectrum of radio-emission
is non-thermal and characterized by anomalously high brightness temperature. Marsh
et al. (2016) have concluded that the white dwarf in AR Sco is spin-powered and in the
ejector state.

In spite of all unique properties, AR Sco is not the only system containing a white
dwarf in the ejector state, i.e. spending its rotation energy according to the canonical
model of a radio-pulsar at a rate which exceeds the observed source luminosity.
It
shares this property with the white dwarf of AE Aquarii (AE Aqr) which is spinning at
1 (de Jager et al.
the period of 33 s and exhibits a period derivative of 5.64
1994). Its spin-down power under these conditions exceeds the bolometric luminosity
of the system (observed in the wide range from radio to X-rays) and can be explained
within the conventional spin-powered pulsar model provided the magnetic moment of

a spin-powered pulsar with the angular velocity ω and dipole magnetic moment µ can

3. Origin of AR Sco

3.1. Spin-up epoch

A possible formation of the ejector white dwarf in the process of binary evolution was
considered in detail in a previous paper (Ikhsanov & Beskrovnaya 2012) dedicated to
the overview of peculiar properties and origin of AE Aqr. The developed approach
can be used here since the white dwarf in AR Sco is currently spinning down at the
107 yr, while its age determined by the cooling time is much
time-scale tsd ≃
≃
longer. Indeed, the cooling time of the white dwarf with the surface temperature Twd ∼
> 109 yr (Schönberner et al. 2000). A
is
10 000 K and mass Mwd ∼

natural conclusion is that fast rotation of the white dwarf is not caused by the singularity
of its birth but is a consequence of peculiar binary evolution incorporating the stage of
rapid spin-up of the white dwarf due to high-rate accretion onto its surface.

A white dwarf can undergo a signiﬁcant accretion-driven spin-up only under con-
dition ˙Msu > ˙Mcr, where ˙Mcr ≃
/yr is a critical rate which provides a stable
burning of hydrogen in the matter accreted onto its surface (see, e.g. Nomoto et al.
2007, and references therein). Otherwise, the situation would resemble the dwarf no-
vae in which the angular momentum is eﬀectively carried away from the white dwarf by

In the process of accretion-driven spin-up the white dwarf could reach the period P

This means that the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the white dwarf should signiﬁcantly
vary in the course of AR Sco evolution. It decreased by a factor of
50 during the
spin-up epoch and returned to its initial value upon its completion. Such evolution of
the magnetic ﬁeld could result from its screening by the accreting material (Bisnovatyi-
Kogan & Komberg 1974). A possibility to bury the magnetic ﬁeld of accreting compact
objects was investigated for both the neutron stars (Konar & Choudhuri 2004; Lovelace
et al. 2005) and the white dwarfs (Cumming 2002). Studies have shown that under
favorable conditions the surface magnetic ﬁeld of a star can decrease by a factor of 100
with its subsequent reemerging due to diﬀusion through the layer of accreted plasma.
3.3. Spin evolution of AR Sco: general scheme and conditions

∼

≪

Following this approach we can outline the following scheme of the AR Sco evolution.
Prior to the stage of active mass transfer the magnetic ﬁeld strength on the surface of the
white dwarf in AR Sco was close to its current value and the mass exchange rate was
˙Msu. As the normal component overﬁlled its Roche lobe, the mass exchange rate
˙M
increased up to ˙Msu ∼
1. This led to decrease of the magnetospheric radius of
1019 g s−
the white dwarf down to R(0)
0.8 cm (here µ34 = µ/1034 G cm−

and start of disk accretion onto its surface provided R(0)
m < Rcor. The latter condition
could be satisﬁed if the initial spin period of the white dwarf was P0 ≥
Due to the surface ﬁeld of the white dwarf screening by plasma accumulating on
its polar caps the magnetospheric radius of the white dwarf was further decreasing. At
the ﬁnal stages of spin-up epoch the magnetic ﬁeld strength on the white dwarf surface
did not exceed 10 MG, that allowed spin-up of the white dwarf to the current value of
its rotation period.

Assuming that the magnetospheric radius of the white dwarf is decreasing at the
same rate as its corotation radius, one can estimate the minimum possible spin-up time
of the white dwarf with account for screening of its magnetic ﬁeld in the process of
accretion from equation I ˙ωs = ˙Msu (GMwdRcor)1/2 as

After the stage of active mass exchange is ﬁnished the magnetic ﬁeld of the white dwarf
is regenerating in the process of diﬀusion through the layer of degenerate matter. The
timescale of this process can be evaluated following Cumming (2002) as

For the magnetic ﬁeld of the white dwarf to reemerge before its spin period can signif-
icantly increase we should require τdiﬀ
tsd. Substituting expression (7) and solving
this inequality for ∆Ma we ﬁnd for the parameters of AR Sco:

Taking into account that the amount of matter accumulated on the white dwarf surface

during the spin-up stage can be estimated as ∆Ma ≥

its evolution to be described in terms of accretion-driven spin-up:

This condition is satisﬁed (Andronov & Yavorskij 1990) for any white dwarf of the
mass in the range 0.81
determined by Marsh et al. (2016). This indicates
that the origin of AR Sco can be explained within the scenario in which the accretion-
driven spin-up is accompanied by screening of the magnetic ﬁeld of the accretor initially
proposed for AE Aqr (for futher discussion see Ikhsanov & Beskrovnaya 2012).
