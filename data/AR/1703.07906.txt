DECOMPOSITION THEORY OF MODULES: THE CASE OF KRONECKER
ALGEBRA

HIDETO ASASHIBA, KEN NAKASHIMA, AND MICHIO YOSHIWAKI

Abstract. Let A be a ﬁnite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k. For any
ﬁnite-dimensional A-module M we give a general formula that computes the indecomposable de-
composition of M without decomposing it, for which we use the knowledge of AR-quivers that are
already computed in many cases. The proof of the formula here is much simpler than that in a prior
literature by Dowbor and Mr´oz. As an example we apply this formula to the Kronecker algebra A
and give an explicit formula to compute the indecomposable decomposition of M , which enables us
to make a computer program.

1. Introduction
Throughout this paper k is an algebraically closed ﬁeld, and all vector spaces, algebras and linear
maps are assumed to be ﬁnite-dimensional k-vector spaces, ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebras and k-linear
maps, respectively. Furthermore all modules over an algebra considered here are assumed to be
ﬁnite-dimensional left modules.

Let A be an algebra, L a complete set of representatives of isoclasses of indecomposable A-modules.
Then the Krull-Schmidt theorem states the following. For each A-module M , there exists a unique
map dM : L → N0 such that

M ∼=

L(dM (L)),

L∈L
M

which is called an indecomposable decomposition of M . Therefore, M ∼= N if and only if dM = dN for
all A-modules M and N , i.e., the map dM is a complete invariant of M under isomorphisms. Note
that since M is ﬁnite-dimensional, the support supp(dM ) := {L ∈ L | dM (L) 6= 0} of dM is a ﬁnite
set. We call such a theory a decomposition theory that computes the indecomposable decomposition
of a module.

Now Krull-Schmidt theorem reduces the description of the module category to that of the full
subcategory of indecomposable modules, for which the Auslander-Reiten theory was developed since
1970s in representation theory of algebras. Almost split sequences are the most important notion in the
theory that combine indecomposable modules by irreducible morphisms, by which unknown indecom-
posables are computed from known ones. In many cases it enabled us to compute the Auslander-Reiten
quiver (AR-quiver for short) of A that is a combinatorial description of the category of modules over
A, the vertex set of which can be identiﬁed with the list L. It is constructed by gluing all meshes that
is a visual form of almost split sequences over A. Thus all information on almost split sequences over
A are encoded in the AR-quiver in a visual way. Namely, if 0 → X → Y → Z → 0 is an almost split
(n ≥ 1) is an indecomposable decomposition of Y with Yi pairwise
sequence, and Y =

The purpose of this paper is to develop a decomposition theory by using the knowledge of AR-
quivers. Thus in the case that L is already computed and all almost split sequences are known, we
aim to compute
(I) dM and
(II) a ﬁnite set SM such that supp(dM ) ⊆ SM ⊆ L

for all A-modules M . Note that (II) is needed to give a ﬁnite algorithm. If A is representation-ﬁnite
(i.e., if the set L is ﬁnite), then the problem (II) is trivial because we can take SM := L.

In the topological data analysis, to analyse the topological features of a point cloud C, a set of
points in Ru for some ﬁxed positive integer u, the persistent homology MC may be used that encodes
topological information on C. Namely, ﬁx a sequence of positive real numbers r1 < r2 < · · · < rn. For
each i a simplicial complex X(ri) is deﬁned by considering balls of radius ri with center c (c ∈ C).
This deﬁnes a sequence MC of k-th homologies:

Hk(X(r1)) → Hk(X(r2)) → · · · → Hk(X(rn))

for a ﬁxed dimension k, which encodes the “lifetime” of the k-dimensional “hole”. Now the persistent
homology MC is just a module over the path algebra Λn = kQn of a quiver Qn of the form

1

α1−→ 2

α2−→ · · ·
of Dynkin type An for some positive integer n. Therefore to understand the topological features of
a point cloud C we can use the knowledge of the map dMC , which is nothing but the “persistence
diagram” of C. Usually the values of dMC (L) (L ∈ L) is presented by colors on L, and L is expressed
by a set of lattice points in a triangle. More precisely, the list L is given by {I(b, d) | 1 ≤ b ≤ d ≤ n}
thanks to Gabriel’s theorem on representations of Dynkin quivers, where I(b, d) is given by

αn−1−−−→ n

0 −→ · · · −→ 0 −→ k 1−→ k 1−→ · · · 1−→ k −→ 0 −→ · · · −→ 0
with k starting at the vertex b and stopping at d (this represents the “lifetime” d − b, “birth” b and
“death” d of a k-dimensional hole). Therefore there exists a 1-1 correspondence between L and the set
{(b, d) | 1 ≤ b ≤ d ≤ n}, which is a subset of Z2 forming a triangle (See for instance papers [11] and
[5]). Note that this set of vertices together with horizontal and vertical edges connecting them can
be regarded as the underlying graph of the AR-quiver of Λn. As an application of our decomposition

theory we gave an explicit formula for Λn-modules, i.e., for the persistent diagram (see formula (3.5)
in Example 3.7). We refer the reader to [9], [4], [5] and [7] for details on persistent homology and/or
topological data analysis.

To analyse some properties of a set of point clouds, e.g., a motion of a point cloud, persistent
homologies were generalized to persistence modules M , which turn out to be modules over an algebra
of the form Λm ⊗k Λn, where we allow any orientation of Qm and Qn. Namely, their underlying graphs
have the form

l

of type Al for l = m, n. Also in this case we need to compute the persistence diagram dM to investigate
the set of point clouds. It was done in [7] for the case (m, n) = (2, 3). Our argument here can be
applied to have a decomposition theory for persistence modules.

Example 1.1. The decomposition theory for polynomial algebras in one variable A = k[x] is already
well known. A ﬁnite-dimensional A-module is a pair (V, f ) of a ﬁnite-dimensional k-vector space V
and an endomorphism f of V , and by ﬁxing a basis of V we may regard V = kd for d := dim V and
f as a square matrix M of size d. In this way we identify (V, f ) with M . In this case we may have
L = {Ji(λ) | i ≥ 1, λ ∈ k}, where Ji(λ) is the Jordan cell of size i ≥ 1 with eigenvalue λ ∈ k. Let Λ
be the set of all distinct eigenvalues of M and set Mλ = M − λEd for λ ∈ Λ. Then the following is
well known.

Theorem 1.2. The problems (I) and (II) are solved as follows.

A solution to (I): Let i ∈ N and λ ∈ Λ. Then

(1.1)

dM (Ji(λ)) =

d + rank M 2
rank M i+1

λ − 2 rank Mλ
λ + rank M i−1

(

λ − 2 rank M i

(Note that by setting M 0
form as the second.)

λ to be the identity matrix of size d, the ﬁrst equality has the same

A solution to (II): SM = {Ji(λ) | i ≤ d, λ ∈ Λ}.

In this paper, we will solve the problem (I) in the decomposition theory for any ﬁnite-dimensional
algebra A. This turns out to be an extension of the result for A = k[x] above. In particular, for the

Kronecker algebra A = kQ with Q = (1

and a solution to the problem (II).

α

β

92 ), we will give an explicit formula for the problem (I)

After submitting the paper we are pointed out by Emerson Escolar and the referee that there was
already a similar investigation [6] by Dowbor and Mr´oz in the literature, which we did not know
before. Thus this work was done independently. We here list some relationships between their results
and ours.

(i) They also have the same statement as Theorem 3.4 and its dual version, namely a solution to
(I). Their proof is similar to the ﬁrst version of ours using a “Cartan matrix” of the module
category of an algebra A and an AR-matrix of A as its inverse, but the proof presented here
does not use them and is much simpliﬁed by using the minimal projective resolutions of simple
functors that are given by almost split sequences and sink maps into indecomposable injective
modules (Proposition 3.3). They also used this as a basic fact but not eﬃciently, namely other
considerations were superﬂuous for the proof.

(ii) Our Theorem 4.3 gives an explicit way of computation of the map dM for a module M by
using ranks of matrices constructed by the structure matrices of M , while they did not give
such formulas explicitly.

(iii) Let M := ( kd1

kd2 ) be a representation of the Kronecker algebra, where M (α), M (β)

M(α)

M(β)

are d2 × d1 matrices. To solve the problem (II) we ﬁrst compute a decomposition

(1.2)

M = PM ⊕ R′

M ⊕ R(∞)M ⊕ IM

of the module M into the preprojective part PM , the preinjective part IM , the regular part
R(∞)M with parameter ∞, and the regular part R′
M without parameter ∞ by using traces
and a reject as follows:

(1.3)

RM ⊕ IM = RejM (Pd2), IM = TrRM ⊕IM (Id1 ), and R(∞)M = TrRM (Rd(∞)),

where RM := R′
M ⊕ R(∞)M is the regular part of M . By applying Theorem 4.3 to each
of PM , R′
M , R(∞)M , and IM we obtain the indecomposable decomposition of the module M .
Note that each of these modules have the smaller dimensions than that of M , which reduces
the complexity of the computation.

On the other hand Dowbor and Mr´oz uses Proposition 4.4 of [6] stating that the regular

indecomposable module Rn(λ) appears as a direct summand of M if the following hold:

(1.4)

λ is a common root of all (d2 −

The main diﬀerence between ours and theirs is in (1.3) and (1.4). To check (1.4) we need
nP
i=1 si. Their complexity seems to
be much greater than that of (1.3) because the latter uses traces and rejects, which needs
(cid:0)
time but is computed only three times. Note also that the decomposition (1.2) given by (1.3)
has an important meaning in its own right. For instance Iwata–Shimizu [8] was interested in
each of the preprojective part PM , the preinjective part IM and the regular part R(∞)M with
parameter ∞ and in that case it is needed to take out those parts separately, which is made
possible by our method.

(iv) They investigated also the cases of general ˜A-quivers and representation-ﬁnite string algebras.

2. Preliminaries
Let m, n be non-negative integers. Then we denote by Mm,n(k) the vector space of m × n matrices
over k, and by En the identity matrix of size n (for n ≥ 1). By the isomorphism Mm,n(k) →
Homk(kn, km) sending each M ∈ Mm,n(k) to the linear map given by the left multiplication by M
we identify Mm,n(k) with Homk(kn, km), and regard each M ∈ Mm,n(k) as the corresponding linear
map kn → km. If m or n is zero, we denote the matrices corresponding to the zero maps kn → km by
Jm,n, respectively and call them empty matrices.

The Kronecker algebra A is a path algebra of the quiver Q = (1

α

β

92 ), and the category mod A of

ﬁnite-dimensional A-modules is equivalent to the category rep Q of ﬁnite-dimensional representations
of Q over k. We usually identify these categories. Recall that a representation M of Q is a diagram

M (1)

M(α)

M(β)

3 M (2) of vector spaces and linear maps, and the dimension vector of M is deﬁned to be

the pair dim M := (dim M (1), dim M (2)). When dim M = (d1, d2), without loss of generality we may
set M (i) = kdi for i = 1, 2 and M (α), M (β) ∈ Md2,d1(k). We denote M by the pair of matrices
(M (α), M (β)).

We here list well known facts on the Kronecker algebra (see Ringel [10, 3.2] for instance).

dim Pn = (n − 1, n), dim In = (n, n − 1), dim Rn(λ) = (n, n)

for all n ∈ N and λ ∈ P1(k) = k ∪ {∞}.

where dotted loops mean that for all n ∈ N the Auslander-Reiten translation τ sends Rn(λ) to

(3) Let X, Y ∈ L. If HomA(X, Y ) 6= 0, then X is “on the left” of Y , i.e., one of the following

occurs:
(i) X ∼= Pm, Y ∼= Pn with m ≤ n,
(ii) X ∈ P, Y ∈ R ∪ I,
(iii) X ∼= Rm(λ), Y ∼= Rn(µ) with λ = µ,

Then if there exists a monomorphism T → U (or an epimorphism U → T ) in mod A, we have
dim T ≤ dim U .

Deﬁnition 3.1. For an indecomposable A-module L we set

SL := HomA(L, -)/ rad HomA(L, -) : mod A → mod k.

It is well-known that SL is a simple functor.

Lemma 3.2. Let M be an A-module. Then for any indecomposable A-module L we have

dM (L) = dim SL(M ).

Proof. Since L is indecomposable, EndA(L) is a local algebra. Therefore SL(L) = EndA(L)/ rad(EndA(L))
is a ﬁnite-dimensional skew ﬁeld over the algebraically closed ﬁeld k, and hence SL(L) ∼= k. If X 6∼= L,
then EndA(L) = rad(EndA(L)), and SL(X) = 0. Thus

for all indecomposable A-modules X. Therefore, the indecomposable decomposition

SL(X) ∼=

k if X ∼= L
if X 6∼= L
0

(cid:26)

of M gives us

which shows the assertion.

M ∼=

SL(M ) ∼= k(dM (L)),

(cid:3)

Recall the following fundamental statement in the Auslander-Reiten theory (see Auslander-Reiten

[3] or Assem-Simson-Skowro´nski [2, IV, 6.11.]):

Proposition 3.3. Let L be an indecomposable A-module. When L is non-injective, let 0 → L

(X ∈ JL). When L is injective, let f : L → L/ soc L =

X (a(X)) be the canonical epimorphism

X∈JL
L

(note that JL = ∅ if L is simple injective). Then the simple functor SL has a minimal projective
resolution

0 → HomA(τ −1L, -)

where g = 0 and τ −1L = 0 if L is injective.

X∈JL
M

Proposition 3.3 together with Lemma 3.2 readily gives us the following.

Theorem 3.4. Let M be an A-module. Then for any indecomposable A-module L we have

dM (L) = dim HomA(L, M ) −

a(X) dim HomA(X, M ) + dim HomA(τ −1L, M ).

X∈JL
X

Remark 3.5. When an algebra A is of the form kQ/I for some quiver Q and some ideal I of kQ,
it is possible to compute dim HomA(H, M ) for every H, M ∈ mod A by using the rank of a suitable
matrix as follows, and thus dM (L) in Theorem 3.4 is computable. First regard A-modules H and
M as representations (H(i), H(α))i∈Q0,α∈Q1 and (M (i), M (α))i∈Q0,α∈Q1 of Q, respectively. Then by
deﬁnition we have

HomA(H, M ) = {(fi)i∈Q0 ∈

Homk(H(i), M (i)) | M (α)fi = fjH(α), ∀α : i → j in Q1}.

(3.1)

Therefore

i∈Q0

HomA(H, M ) ∼= {x ∈ kN | Bx = 0},

where N :=

dim H(i) dim M (i) and B is a c×N -matrix given as the coeﬃcient matrix of the ho-

mogeneous system of linear equations M (α)fi−fjH(α) = 0 for fi, where c :=

P

Hence we obtain the equality:

dim M (j) dim H(i).

α:i→j in Q1
X

dim HomA(H, M ) = N − rank B.
Example 3.6. Let A := k[x] be the polynomial algebra in one variable. Although it is an inﬁnite-
dimensional algebra, the category mod A of ﬁnite-dimensional A-modules is well understood because
k[x] is a principal ideal domain, and we can apply Auslander-Reiten theory to mod A. It is easy to
give all almost split sequences over k[x]. Namely, they are given as follows:

(3.2)

0 → J1(λ) → J2(λ) → J1(λ) → 0,
0 → Ji(λ) → Ji−1(λ) ⊕ Ji+1(λ) → Ji(λ) → 0
for all i ≥ 2 and λ ∈ k. This is veriﬁed by the similar argument used in the Nakayama algebra case
(cf. [2, 4.1 Theorem]). The reader may notice a similarity between (1.1) and (3.2), which will become
clear now. Let M = (kd, M ) be an A-module. Then we have

(3.3)

dim HomA(Ji(λ), M ) = d − rank M i
λ,

which together with Theorem 3.4 and the formula (3.2) yields the formula (1.1).

Indeed, let X ∈ Md,i(k), and put Xj to be the j-th column of X (j = 1, . . . , i). Then by (3.1)
X ∈ HomA(Ji(λ), M ) iﬀ M X = XJi(λ) = X(λEi + Ji(0)) = λX + XJi(0) iﬀ MλX = XJi(0) iﬀ
Mλ(X1, . . . , Xi) = (0, X1, . . . , Xi−1) iﬀ Mλ maps Xj’s as follows

Xi 7→ Xi−1 7→ · · · 7→ X1 7→ 0.

Hence the correspondence X 7→ Xi yields the isomorphism (the inverse is given by the correspondence
v 7→ [M i−1

v, . . . , Mλv, v])

HomA(Ji(λ), M ) ∼= {v ∈ kd | M i

which shows the equality (3.3).

important applications in the topological data analysis (See the introduction). Let M := (Mi)n

4. Solution to the problem (I) for the Kronecker algebra

the dimensions of the spaces HomA(L, M ) for all L ∈ L and M ∈ mod A following Remark 3.5.

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let M be an A-module. We ﬁrst deﬁne the following matrices with n ≥ 1, λ ∈ k
(note that P1(M ) = J0,1 is an empty matrix).

where we put Mλ(α, β) := λM (α) − M (β), and we deﬁne the following numbers.

p1(M ) := 0, pn(M ) := rank Pn(M ) (n ≥ 2),
i0(M ) := 0, in(M ) := rank In(M ) (n ≥ 1),
rn(λ, M ) := rank Rn(λ, M ) (n ≥ 1, λ ∈ P1(k)).

Using the data above we can compute the dimensions of Hom spaces HomA(L, M ) with L inde-

composable as follows.

Proposition 4.2. Let M be an A-module. Then we have the following formulas:

dim HomA(Pn, M ) =

(n − 1)d1 − pn−1(M )
d2

(n ≥ 2)
(n = 1)

(

dim HomA(In, M ) = nd1 − in(M )

(n ≥ 1)

dim HomA(Rn(λ), M ) = nd1 − rn(λ, M )

(n ≥ 1, λ ∈ P1(k))

Proof. Assume that n ≥ 2. Let (X, Y ) ∈ Md1,n−1(k) × Md2,n(k), and put Xi (resp. Yi) to be i-th
column of X (i = 1, . . . , n − 1) (resp. Y (i = 1, . . . , n)). Then by (3.1) (X, Y ) ∈ HomA(Pn, M ) iﬀ

Let B be the coeﬃcient matrix of this equation. Then a direct calculation shows that B is equivalent
to Pn−1(M ) ⊕ End2. Therefore rank B = nd2 + pn−1(M ), which shows that dim HomA(Pn, M ) =
(n − 1)d1 + nd2 − rank B = (n − 1)d1 − pn−1(M ), as desired. The remaining formulas are proved
(cid:3)
similarly.

Propositions 4.2 and Theorem 3.4 give us a solution to the problem (I) for the Kronecker algebra

as follows.

Theorem 4.3. Let M be an A-module. Then we have the following formulas:

dM (Pn) =

dM (In) =

dM (Rn(λ)) =

(

(

(

2pn(M ) − pn−1(M ) − pn+1(M )
d2 − p2(M )

(n = 1),

2in−1(M ) − in(M ) − in−2(M )

(n ≥ 2)
(n = 1),

rn−1(λ, M ) + rn+1(λ, M ) − 2rn(λ, M )
r2(λ, M ) − 2r1(λ, M )

(n ≥ 2)
(n = 1).

Here we note that dM (P1) and dM (I1) have obvious meanings that dM (P1) = dim Coker[M (β) M (α)]
and dM (I1) = dim Ker
(cid:20)

M (β)
M (α)

(cid:21)

.

Proof. Note that by Theorem 2.1(2) we know all the almost split sequences for the Kronecker al-
gebra. Therefore we can apply Theorem 3.4. We ﬁrst compute dM (P1) and dM (I1). Noting that
dim HomA(P2, M ) = d1 − p1(M ) = d1 the almost split sequence starting at P1 that is given by the
mesh starting at P1 in the AR-quiver shows that

dM (P1) = dim HomA(P1, M ) − 2 dim HomA(P2, M ) + dim HomA(P3, M )

= d2 − 2d1 + 2d1 − p2(M ) = d2 − p2(M )
= d2 − rank[M (β) M (α)] = dim Coker[M (β) M (α)].

Now since I1 is simple and injective, we have I1/ soc I1 = 0 and τ −1I1 = 0. Hence

dM (I1) = dim HomA(I1, M ) = d1 − i1(M )

= d1 − rank
(cid:20)

M (β)
M (α)

(cid:21)

= dim Ker

(cid:20)

M (β)
M (α)

(cid:21)

.

Next we compute dM (Pn) for n ≥ 2.

dM (Pn) = dim HomA(Pn, M ) − 2 dim HomA(Pn+1, M ) + dim HomA(Pn+2, M )

= (n − 1)d1 − pn−1(M ) − 2(nd1 − pn(M )) + (n + 1)d1 − pn+1(M )
= 2pn(M ) − pn−1(M ) − pn+1(M ),

as desired. The remaining cases are proved similarly.

5. Solution to the problem (II) for the Kronecker algebra

Let F :

L∈L L(dM (L)) → M be an isomorphism. Then we have

L

M = PM ⊕ RM ⊕ IM ,
L∈I L(dM (L)) by F ,
L∈P L(dM (L)),
where PM , RM and IM are the images of
respectively. To compute PM , RM and IM we here use the trace and reject in a module of a class of
modules (see Anderson–Fuller [1] for details). Let U be a class of modules in mod A and M ∈ mod A.
Recall that the trace TrM (U) of U in M and the reject RejM (U) of U in M are deﬁned by

L∈R L(dM (L)) and

L

L

L

TrM (U) :=

{Im f | f ∈ HomA(U, M ) for some U ∈ U}, and

RejM (U) :=

X

{Ker f | f ∈ HomA(M, U ) for some U ∈ U}.

When U = {U } is a singleton, we set TrM (U ) := TrM (U) and RejM (U ) := RejM (U). We cite the
following from [1, 8.18 Proposition].

\

Lemma 5.1. Let (Mi)i∈I be a family of A-modules indexed by a set I and U a class of modules in
mod A. Then we have

Tr

Li∈I Mi (U) =

TrMi (U)

and Rej

Li∈I Mi (U) =

RejMi (U).

i∈I

Proposition 5.2 (Calculation of RM ⊕ IM ). If {f1, . . . , fa} is a basis of HomA(M, Pd2), then we

(5.1)

By Lemma 5.1 we have

T

RejM (Pd2 ) = RM ⊕ IM .

RejM (Pd2 ) = RejPM ⊕RM ⊕IM (Pd2 ) = RejPM (Pd2 ) ⊕ RejRM (Pd2 ) ⊕ RejIM (Pd2 ).

By Theorem 2.1(3) we have HomA(RM , Pd2 ) = 0 and HomA(IM , Pd2) = 0, which shows that

RejRM (Pd2 ) = RM and RejIM (Pd2) = IM .
If a preprojective indecomposable module Pi is a direct summand of M , then it follows from (i−1, i) =
i=1 P (ai)
d2
dim Pi ≤ dim M = (d1, d2) that i ≤ d2 (see Remark 2.2(2)). Therefore, we have PM =
d2
i=1(RejPi (Pd2))(ai). Now if
for some ai ≥ 0 (we identify Pi with F (Pi)), and then RejPM (Pd2 ) =
i ≤ d2, then by Remark 2.2(1) we have a monomorphism Pi → Pd2, which shows that RejPi (Pd2 ) = 0
for all i ≤ d2, and therefore

L

Hence the equality (5.1) holds.

RejPM (Pd2 ) = 0.

have

By Theorem 2.1(3) we have HomA(Id1 , RM ) = 0, which shows that

TrRM (Id1 ) = 0.

If a preinjective indecomposable module Ii is a direct summand of M , then it follows from (i, i − 1) =
i=1 I (bi)
d1
for some bi ≥ 0 (we
dim Ii ≤ dim M = (d1, d2) that i ≤ d1. Therefore we have IM =
i
d1
i=1(TrIi (Id1 ))(bi). Now if i ≤ d1, then we have an
identify Ii with F (Ii)), and then TrIM (Id1) =
epimorphism Id1 → Ii, which shows that TrIi (Id1) = Ii for all i ≤ d1, and therefore

L

L

Hence the equality (5.2) holds.

(cid:3)

TrIM (Id1 ) = IM .

By Propositions 5.2 and 5.3 we have the following.

Proposition 5.4 (Calculation of RM ). Let {f1, . . . , fa} a basis of HomA(M, Pd2 ) and {g1, . . . , gb} a
basis of HomA(Id1,

a
i=1 Ker fi). Then we have

T

RM ∼=

By this isomorphism we identify RM with the right hand side. Since RM = (RM (α), RM (β)) is the
direct sum of regular indecomposable modules, both RM (α) and RM (β) are square matrices, say of
d
size d. Put R(∞) := TrRM (Rd(∞)). Note that TrRM (Rd(∞)) = TrRM (
n=1 Rn(∞)) because there
exists an epimorphism Rn(∞) → Rm(∞) for n ≥ m. Then RM = R(∞) ⊕ R′ for some A-submodule
R′ = (X ′, Y ′) of RM such that R′ has no direct summand of the form Rn(∞) for any n by Theorem
[Decompose RM into indecomposables of the form Rn(λ) with n ≥ 1, λ ∈ P1(k). Then
2.1(3)(iii).
R′ is given by the direct sum of those direct summands of the form Rn(λ) with λ 6= ∞ because
R(∞) is given by the direct sum of summands of the form Rn(∞). Note that R′ is also computed as
R′ = RejRM (Rd(∞)).] Since the matrix X ′ is invertible, we have

L

R′ ∼= (El, (X ′)−1Y ′)

for some l ≤ d. Therefore, the set Λ of eigenvalues of (X ′)−1Y ′ is ﬁnite.

Then by Propositions 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4, we obtain the following.

Theorem 5.5. Set

SM := {Pi, Ij, Rk(λ) | 1 ≤ i ≤ d2, 1 ≤ j ≤ d1, 1 ≤ k ≤ d, λ ∈ Λ ∪ {∞}}.

Then this gives a solution to the problem (II) for the Kronecker algebra.

Remark 5.6. Note that if R(∞) = 0, then we can replace SM by

{Pi, Ij, Rk(λ) | 1 ≤ i ≤ d2, 1 ≤ j ≤ d1, 1 ≤ k ≤ d, λ ∈ Λ}.

Similarly, we have pn(M ) = 2n for n ≥ 3. Hence by Theorem 4.3 we have
dM (P1) = 3 − p2(M ) = 0,
dM (P2) = 2p2(M ) − p1(M ) − p3(M ) = 6 − 0 − 6 = 0,
dM (P3) = 2p3(M ) − p2(M ) − p4(M ) = 12 − 3 − 8 = 1,

and for n ≥ 4,

dM (Pn) = 2pn(M ) − pn−1(M ) − pn+1(M ) = 2 · 2n − 2(n − 1) − 2(n + 1) = 0.

Thus we can conﬁrm dM (P3) = 1 and dM (Pn) = 0 for n 6= 3.

TrRejM (P2)(I2) = Im g1 + Im g2 = (J0,1, J0,1) = I1
with dim TrRejM (P2)(I2) = (1, 0), and RejM (P2)/ TrRejM (P2)(I2) ∼= R1(0). Thus we can conﬁrm the
process to get SM = {P1, P2, I1, I2, R1(0)} in Section 5.

The starting idea was made when the ﬁrst named author was at the lecture on the Kronecker
canonical form of singular mixed matrix pencils by S. Iwata at CREST meeting in February, 2016.
In fact, later we recognized that Iwata–Shimizu [8] had given relationships between values of ranks
pn(M ) (resp. in(M ), rn(0, M ), and rn(∞, M )) in Deﬁnition 4.1 and the values of dM (L) for L = Pn
(resp. In, Rn(0), and Rn(∞)) in Theorem 2.1. However, they did not mention regular indecomposables
Rn(λ) with λ 6= 0, ∞. The authors would like to thank S. Iwata for his lecture and M. Takamatsu for
informing us of the paper [8]. After submitting the paper E. Escolar and the referee pointed out that
the paper [6] is already published dealing with the same problem with similar results, for which we
are very thankful. This work is partially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientiﬁc Research 25610003
