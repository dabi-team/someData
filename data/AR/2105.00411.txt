Abstract In this article, we investigate the formation and disruption of a coro-
nal sigmoid from the active region (AR) NOAA 11909 on 07 December 2013,
by analyzing multi-wavelength and multi-instrument observations. Our analysis
suggests that the formation of the sigmoid initiated ≈ 1 hour before its eruption
through a coupling between two twisted coronal loop systems. This sigmoid can
be well regarded as of ‘transient’ class due to its short lifetime as the eruptive
activities started just after ≈ 20 min of its formation. A comparison between
coronal and photospheric images suggests that the coronal sigmoid was formed
over a simple β-type AR which also possessed dispersed magnetic ﬁeld structure
in the photosphere. The line-of-sight photospheric magnetograms also reveal
moving magentic features, small-scale ﬂux cancellation events near the polarity
inversion line, and overall ﬂux cancellation during the extended pre-eruption
phase which suggest the role of tether-cutting reconnection toward the build-up
of the ﬂux rope. The disruption of the sigmoid proceeded with a two-ribbon
eruptive M1.2 ﬂare (SOL2013-12-07T07:29). In radio frequencies, we observe
type III and type II bursts in meter wavelengths during the impulsive phase of
the ﬂare. The successful eruption of the ﬂux rope leads to a fast coronal mass
ejection (with a linear speed of ≈ 1085 km s−1) in SOHO/LASCO ﬁeld-of-view.
During the evolution of the ﬂare, we clearly observe typical “sigmoid-to-arcade”

transformation. Prior to the onset of the impulsive phase of the ﬂare, ﬂux rope
undergoes a slow rise (≈ 15 km s−1) which subsequently transitions into a fast
eruption (≈ 110 km s−1). The two-phase evolution of the ﬂux rope shows tem-
poral associations with the soft X-ray precursor and impulsive phase emissions
of the M-class ﬂare, respectively, thus pointing toward a feedback relationship
between magnetic reconnection and early CME dynamics.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂares are characterized by the sudden enhancement of localised brightness
in the solar atmosphere. During a ﬂare, a tremendous amount of energy, ranging
as high as 1028- 1032 erg, is released which manifests its signatures in the entire
electromagnetic spectrum i.e. γ-rays to radio waves (e.g. see review by Shibata
and Magara, 2011). It is now well understood that a ﬂare may be accompanied by
the expulsion of large amount of plasma from the corona into the interplanetary
space, i.e. Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). Contrary to such ‘eruptive ﬂares’, a
second class of ﬂares known as ‘conﬁned ﬂares’, do not show any association
with CMEs. The conﬁned ﬂares mostly undergo evolution in compact loop net-
works without causing signiﬁcant reconﬁguration of the large scale magnetic
conﬁguration (see e.g. Kushwaha et al., 2014). On the other hand, the eruptive
ﬂares and associated CMEs cause large-scale changes in the coronal magnetic
structure. Further, Earth-directed CMEs are known for their geo-eﬀectiveness.
It is, therefore, essential to study the source region characteristics of CMEs for
a better understanding of space weather phenomena.

Observations show that the CME-productive active regions exhibit some inter-
esting features during the pre-eruption phase such as coronal sigmoids, ﬁlaments
(or prominences), ﬁlament channels, and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) hot channels
(see reviews by Gibson et al., 2006; Alexander, 2006; Chen, 2011; Toriumi and
Wang, 2019). Among these features, ﬁlaments are the most studied structures
associated with solar eruptions. Filaments are dark thread-like structures which
consist of cool, dense plasma material embedded in the hot tenuous solar corona
(Martin, 1998). These structures are traditionally observed in ground based Hα
images. When observed above the solar limb, these structures appear bright
against dark background, hence, are termed as prominences (Parenti, 2014).
Filaments exist along the magnetic neutral line or polarity inversion line with
their legs rooted in the opposite polarity magnetic ﬂux regions. The narrow
lanes between opposite polarity magnetic ﬁelds where a ﬁlament can be formed,
are called ﬁlament channels (Engvold, 1997). Space based observations have
revealed important hot-plasma structures that form in the active region corona,
such as, sigmoids and hot channels. Sigmoids are S (or inverse S) shaped struc-
tures which are observed in soft X-ray (SXR; Manoharan et al., 1996; Rust and
Kumar, 1996) and EUV emissions (Cheng et al., 2014; Joshi et al., 2017a). With

the advent of multi-channel EUV imaging from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA; Lemen et al., 2012) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell,
Thompson, and Chamberlin, 2012), hot cohrent plasma structures (often termed
as hot channels) have been identiﬁed from several CME producing active regions
(Cheng et al., 2013; Patsourakos, Vourlidas, and Stenborg, 2013; Nindos et al.,
2015). These features essentially provide evidence of the magnetic ﬂux rope: a
set of magnetic ﬁeld lines winding around a common axis (Gibson and Fan,
2006). Contemporary, multiwavelength studies suggest these hot channels to be
the earliest signature of a CME in the source region (Cheng et al., 2011; Joshi
et al., 2017a; James et al., 2017; Mitra and Joshi, 2019; Sahu et al., 2020).

The formation mechanisms of the ﬂux ropes in the corona have been addressed
in many studies. It has been suggested that the presence of the coronal ﬂux ropes
is intrinsically related to their emergence from subphotospheric layers (Amari,
Luciani, and Aly, 2004; Archontis et al., 2004). Further, it has been recognised
that a magnetic ﬂux rope can be formed above the photosphere by shearing
motions, emergence or submergence of the photospheric ﬂux, or by the com-
binations of these processes; the above mechanisms essentially rely on the ﬂux
cancellation at the photosphere (Kusano, 2005; Mackay and van Ballegooijen,
2006; Green and Kliem, 2009; Green, Kliem, and Wallace, 2011; Cheng et al.,
2013). In view of the onset of an eruptive ﬂare, the observations suggest that the
ﬂux rope associated structures can be formed either during a solar eruption or
may exist well before it (Zhang, Cheng, and Ding, 2012; Patsourakos, Vourlidas,
and Stenborg, 2013; James et al., 2017; Mitra, Joshi, and Prasad, 2020). The
studies further indicates that the in-situ build-up of the ﬂux rope during or just
before an eruptive event is accomplished via magnetic reconnections (Cheng
et al., 2011; Patsourakos, Vourlidas, and Stenborg, 2013; Kumar et al., 2016). It
is noteworthy that the existance of the ﬂux rope in CMEs have been evidenced
by near-Earth spacecraft measurements, in particular, by the in-situ detection of
magnetic clouds (D´emoulin, Janvier, and Dasso, 2016; Wang et al., 2018; Syed
Ibrahim et al., 2019). Although the origin and basic structures of the ﬂux ropes
have been recognised and studied in many previous studies, there is a lot more to
learn about the formation process of the ﬂux ropes and temporal aspects of their
evolution with respect to the onset of CMEs in the source region. Simultaneous
multi-channel observations obtained from Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI;
Schou et al., 2012) and AIA onboard SDO at high spatial and temporal resolu-
tions have provided us with a unique opportunity for such investigations. The
multi-wavelength observations ensure the examination of various layers of the
solar atmosphere right from the photosphere to the lower corona. Once a ﬂux
rope formed in the corona, the dips in the helical magnetic structure provide
support for the ﬁlament material against gravity (Kuperus and Raadu, 1974;
Gibson and Fan, 2006, see also review by Gibson, 2018). However, the presence
of dipped magnetic structure does not provide the necessity for the ﬁlament.
The existance of the ﬁlament channel is more frequent than the ﬁlament itself,
pointing toward a magnetic environment which is able to support the ﬁlament
even if the ﬁlament does not exists itself. The ﬁlament is often overlaid by the
sigmoidal structure (Gibson et al., 2002). The relationship between the ﬁlament
and the sigmoid have been discussed in many previous studies (Gibson and Low,

2000; Pevtsov, 2002; R´egnier and Amari, 2004; Joshi et al., 2017a, see also review
by Gibson, 2018). By using Yohkoh SXR data and Hα full disk observation,
Pevtsov (2002) have studied sigmoid-ﬁlament association for six active regions.
He found a cospatial association between ﬁlament and sigmoid, through which
he concluded that both features are related to same topological structure. Based
on three-dimensional non-linear force free ﬁeld modelling, R´egnier and Amari
(2004) have investigated the relationship between ﬁlament and sigmoid in the
active region 8151. They have addresed that both the ﬁlament and the sigmoid
can be described by long twisted ﬂux tubes.

Sigmoids indicate the presence of sheared and weakly twisted coronal ﬁeld
lines with twist of around 1 turn in the ﬁeld. These sheared and twisted magnetic
ﬁeld structures can store free magnetic energy (Gibson et al., 2006) and have
been regarded as the source region of powerful CMEs. Using SXR images from
the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) on the Yohkoh satellite, Hudson et al. (1998)
examined the coronal structures associated with the halo CMEs and found a
characteristic pattern of sigmoid-to-arcade development with the passage of a
CME. Using SXT data, Canﬁeld, Hudson, and McKenzie (1999) classiﬁed active
regions according to their morphology (sigmoidal or non-sigmoidal) and nature of
activity (eruptive or non-eruptive). They have found that the sigmoidal active
regions are prone to be eruptive than the non-sigmoidal regions. In the case
study of a major geo-eﬀective CME from acive region NOAA 12371, Joshi et al.
(2018) found CME to be associated with a coronal sigmoid that displayed an
intense emission from its core before the onset of the eruption. Various studies
have been performed in order to understand the formation and eruption of the
sigmoids (Sterling et al., 2000; Savcheva et al., 2012; Joshi et al., 2017a). Joshi
et al. (2017a) studied the formation of a coronal sigmoid in the active region
NOAA 11719 and found that the development of sigmoid structure occurred
through the successive interaction between two J-shaped bundles of loops. Mi-
tra et al. (2018) examined two major X-class solar ﬂares from the sigmoidal
active region NOAA 12673 and found that the complex network of δ-sunspots
in the active region resulted to the formation of the sigmoid in the hot EUV
channel. Their study also revealed the ﬂux rope structure by coronal magnetic
ﬁeld modeling. The multiwavelength case studies of the build-up processes of
the coronal sigmoids and early evolutionary phases of CMEs from these regions
are therefore extremely important toward understanding the origin of large-scale
solar eruptions and development of methods for their forecast.

In view of the above scientiﬁc motivations, here we present a comprehensive
multi-wavelength analysis of the formation of coronal sigmoid and subsequent
disruption from the region that resulted into a fast CME (≈ 1085 km s−1)
and an M-class two-ribbon ﬂare (SOL2013-12-07T07:29). The sigmoidal ﬂux
rope was developed over a magnetically weaker and dispersed bipolar active
region (AR) NOAA 11909 on 07 December 2013. Further, sigmoidal structure
disrupted just ≈ 20 min after its complete formation; hence, it can be justiﬁably
called a ‘transient’ sigmoid. The ﬂux rope activates during the precursor phase
of the M1.2 ﬂare during which the ﬂux rope slowly rose. Subsequently, the ﬂux
rope moved to the phase of eruptive expansion with the onset of impulsive ﬂare
emission and exhibited important observational signatures in EUV and radio

wavelengths. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we discuss a brief ac-
count of the observational data and method used for the study. Multi-wavelength
observations and results are presented in Section 3. We discuss and interpret the
results in Section 4. A summary of the results is provided in Section 5.

2. Observational Data and Method

For the multi-wavelength study of M1.2 ﬂare on 07 December 2013 and its source
active region (NOAA 11909), we analyze data from multiple ground and space
borne instruments which are brieﬂy discussed below:

1. Observations of the diﬀerent solar atmospheric layers in (E)UV wavelengths
are obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al.,
2012) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO: Pesnell, Thompson, and
Chamberlin, 2012). SDO/AIA provides solar images in seven EUV channels:
94 ˚A, 131 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 304 ˚A, and 335 ˚A; two UV channels: 1600
˚A and 1700 ˚A; and one white light channel: 4500 ˚A. AIA provides 4096 ×
4096 pixel images at a high resolution of 0”.6 per pixel with a cadence of 12
sec.

2. For the photospheric observation of the Sun, we have used the data provided
by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI: Schou et al., 2012) of SDO. HMI
has spatial resolution of 0”.5 per pixel. We used white light continnum inten-
sity images and line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of the solar photosphere
with a temporal cadence of 45 sec.

3. CME observations are analysed by the C2 and C3 white light coronagraphs of
Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO: Brueckner et al., 1995)
on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO: Domingo, Fleck,
and Poland, 1995). The ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) for C2 and C3 coronagraphs are
1.5–6 R(cid:12) and 3.7–30 R(cid:12), respectively.

4. To study radio emission associated with this eruptive ﬂare, we have ana-
lyzed the data obtained from extended Compact Astronomical Low-cost Low-
frequency Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory 1 (e-
CALLISTO; Benz, Monstein, and Meyer, 2005). The radio observations pre-
sented in this study are taken from the Ooty station of the e-CALLISTO
network.

5. We have used the Hα observation with the Solar Flare Telescope (SFT;
Ichimoto et al., 1991) operated at National Astronomical Observatory of
Japan (NAOJ), Mitaka. SFT is the ground-based instrument of Solar Science
Observatory.

6. Soft X-Ray (SXR) images of the Sun has been taken from the observations of
Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) aboard Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite (GOES; Bornmann et al., 1996). SXI provides the full-disk images
of the Sun in X-rays with a temporal cadence of one minute.

In this study, coronal magnetic ﬁeld lines are modeled by employing the po-
tential ﬁeld extrapolation method by solving a Green’s function (Seehafer, 1978)
which is available in the SolarSoftware library encoded in the Interactive Data
Language (IDL). As the boundary condition for potential ﬁeld extrapolation,
we used z-component of photospheric vector magnetogram of 06:15 UT from
hmi.sharp cea 720s series of HMI/SDO at a spatial resolution of 0”.5 pixel−1
and temporal cadence of 720s. Here, the HMI magnetogram has a dimension
of 812×462 pixels which corresponds to a size of ≈294×160 Mm. Extrapola-
tion has been performed up to a height of ≈160 Mm from the photosphere.
The extrapolated ﬁeld lines are visualised by using Visualization and Analysis
Platform for Ocean, Atmosphere, and Solar Researchers (VAPOR; Clyne et al.,
2007) software.

3. Multiwavelength Observations and Results

3.1. Overview of Flaring Active Region NOAA 11909

On the day of the reported activity i.e. 07 December 2013, the AR NOAA 11909
was situated at the heliographic coordinate S16W49. This AR emerged from the
eastern limb of the Sun on 28 November 2013 as β-type sunspot and moved to
the far side of the Sun over the western limb on 10 December 2013 as α-type.
During its lifetime, its magnetic conﬁguration evolved as β - βγ - β - α- type
and produced three C-class and only one M-class solar ﬂares.

Figure 1 shows the multi-wavelength view of AR NOAA 11909 on 07 Decem-
ber 2013 at 05:49 UT, prior to the onset of the M-class ﬂare. Figures 1a and
b display the photospheric continnum intensity image and LOS magnetogram,
respectively. It is clear from these panels that the AR consists of several small
to medium size sunspots with dispersed magnetic ﬁeld. Among these sunspots,
the largest one (indicated by blue arrow) form the main sunspot of the leading
group. Comparison of Figures 1a and b conﬁrms that the leading sunspot group
largly consists of positive magnetic polarity while the trailing part of the AR is
of negative polarity. Notably, magnetic ﬂux in the trailing sunspot group is quite
dispersed and composed of a couple of smaller sunspots (shown by green arrows)
along with small ﬂux element of the plage region. The positive and negative ﬂux
regions exhibit a clear seperation so that a polarity inversion line (PIL) can be
easily drawn which is delineated by a dashed yellow curve in Figure 1b. The
clear distinction of bipolar region suggests this AR to be a β-type, prior to the
reported activity. Hα image of AR shows the presence of two ﬁlaments: F1 and
F2, lying approximately along the PIL which are indicated by red arrows in
Figure 1c. Filament F1 lies in the northern part while ﬁlament F2 lies in the
southern part of the PIL.

In Figure 2a, we show AIA 171 ˚A image of the active region at 06:24 UT.
For a clear visualisation of coronal features, the image is processed by Multi-
Scale Gaussian Normalisation (MGN; Morgan and Druckm¨uller, 2014) tech-
nique, which is based on localised normalisation of the data over a range of spatial
scales. In order to display the distribution of the photospheric LOS magnetic

ﬁeld, we have overplotted HMI magnetogram as contours. Red and blue contours
are used to distinguish positive and negative polarity ﬂuxes, respectively. Two
distinct sets of coronal loops can be observed from the AIA 171 ˚A image of
the AR (Figure 2a) that resemble a closed (white arrows) and an open (green
arrows) magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Notably, the following sunspot group is
associated with closed ﬁeld lines while closed as well as open ﬁeld lines originate
from the leading sunspot group. To conﬁrm the presence of open ﬁeld lines in
the AR, we have extrapolated coronal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration by the use
of potential ﬁeld extrapolation method (see Section 2). In Figures 2b and c, we
display extrapolated coronal ﬁeld lines from front and side views, respectively.
We noticed the presence of diﬀerent sets of closed coronal loops, connecting
the positive ﬂux region of leading sunspot group with the negative ﬂux of the
following sunspot group. The AR also contains open ﬁeld lines which originate
from the positive polarity regions of the leading sunspot group (shown by blue
and cyan color lines).

3.2. Build-up of Coronal Sigmoid in the Active Region

During ≈ 06:20 UT–07:00 UT, we observed signatures of the development of
a coronal sigmoid. In Figure 3, we present a series of AIA 94 ˚A images which
show sequential formation of sigmoid in the activity region. Much before the
onset of the ﬂare (≈ 1 hour), two bundles of coronal loops are identiﬁed which
are indicated by the arrows in Figure 3a. At this stage, we cannot identify any
connectivity between these two bundles of loops. From ≈ 06:36 UT, a connection
starts to develop between the loops (shown by arrow in Figure 3b). From ≈
06:36 UT–06:55 UT, the connecting loop system undergoes through continuous
evolution and expansion. As a result, we observe the establishment of the sigmoid
at ≈ 07:00 UT (shown by red curve in Figure 3e) which provides an evidence
for the presence of the magnetic ﬂux rope. A multi-wavelength view of the fully
developed sigmoid is presented in Figure 4. Figures 4a and b display the sigmoid
in EUV AIA 94 ˚A and 131 ˚A channels, respectively. Figure 4c shows the SXR
image of the sigmoid. For a clear identiﬁcation of the sigmoid, we have marked
the sigmoid structure by a dotted curve in all of the panels. This sigmoidal ﬂux
rope appeared till the begining of the M-class ﬂare at ≈ 07:17 UT. Afterward,
the sigmoid disrupted as the eruption of the ﬂux rope proceded (described in
Section 3.5).

3.3. Evolutionary Phases of M1.2 Flare

Figure 5a depicts the temporal variation of the SXR ﬂux in the 1–8 ˚A (shown
by violet curve) and 0.5–4 ˚A (shown by red curve) wavelength bands of the
GOES during the time interval 06:30 UT–09:30 UT on 07 December 2013. The
evolution of the ﬂare can be summarized by three phases: precursor (≈07:00
UT–07:17 UT), impulsive (≈07:17 UT–07:30 UT), and gradual phase (≈07:30
UT–08:55 UT). The precursor phase is characterised by small-scale and gradual
energy release during the slow rise of the sigmoidal ﬂux rope. For characterising
the impulsive phase of the ﬂare, we have analyzed the temporal variation of the

MK), 304 ˚A (50,000 K), and 1600 ˚A (10,000 K) wavelength bands of SDO/AIA
are presented in Figure 5b. The region selected for constructing the AIA light
curves is shown by the white box in Figure 3f. This region has been chosen
because the ﬂaring activity during the studied period was occurred within this
region. It is to be noted that the intensity variation at the hot AIA 94 ˚A channel
resembles the GOES soft X-ray proﬁles with some time delay in their peak
ﬂux which indicate that, in spite of diﬀerent temperature sensitivities of the
instruments, both emissions originate from hot ﬂaring plasma ﬁlled in the coronal
loops. Interestingly, time proﬁles of the intensity variations in other AIA channels
(except 1600 ˚A) display two stage evolution. In the ﬁrst stage, a sudden rise and
fall of the intensity is observed while in the second stage the intensity variation is
rather gradual. The intensity variation in AIA 1600 ˚A channel shows only single
stage evolution which resembles the ﬁrst stage of other AIA channels, viz. 171
˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, and 304 ˚A. Notably, the ﬁrst stage of the intensity variation
in these channels is noticed earlier than the peak of GOES ﬂux.

Build-up and Disruption of a Transient Sigmoid

3.4. Photospheric Magnetic Field Variations

In order to understand the formation of sigmoid and triggering mechanism of
the eruptive ﬂare, it is important to examine the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld
changes in the AR. Such changes result in the storage of magnetic energy in
the corona and start to contribute much before the eruption. In Figure 6a we
provide HMI magnetogram on 06 December 2013 at 00:10 UT, one day prior to
the ﬂaring activity. The region with signiﬁcant photospheric changes is marked
by the black box in Figure 6a (see the animation associated with Figure 6). To
probe, further magnetic changes, we provide a series of selected magnetograms
of the marked subregion from 00:10 UT on 06 December 2013 to 05:10 UT on 07
December 2013. The green and blue boxes in Figures 6b and 6j show the regions
associated with the prominent changes in negative and positive polarity ﬂuxes,
respectively. Comparing these two panels, we can clearly observe a signiﬁcant
cancellation of the negative polarity ﬂux as well as decay of the positive polarity
ﬂux. A small element of positive polarity is noticeable near the patch of negative
polarity (indicated by red arrow in Figure 6b). The negative polarity patch
undergoes continuous movement in northward direction and cancels out the
positive polarity element (marked by red arrow in Figure 6d). The negative
polarity patch continues its moving behaviour and disappears in the subsequent
intervel (marked by red arrows in Figure 6e–h). Few other moving magnetic
features of negative polarity are also noted near the PIL (indicated by yellow
and green arrows in Figures 6b–j) which also get cancelled out subsequently.

In Figure 7a, we plot the positive and negative ﬂuxes through the whole
AR (as shown in Figure 6a). For comparing magnetic ﬂux variation with the
coronal energy release, we plot the GOES SXR ﬂux in 1–8 and 0.5–4 ˚A wavelenth
channels in Figure 7b. We have found that the positive and negative polarity
magnetic ﬂuxes show large variations before the onset of the ﬂaring activity. It
decreases in a periodic manner. About ﬁve hour prior to the event (at ≈ 02:00
UT on 07 December 2013), the positive and negative ﬂuxes start to decrease
continuously. With the onset of the M1.2 ﬂare (indicated by vertical dashed line
in Figures 7a and b), both the ﬂuxes maintain an almost steady level.

3.5. Eruption of Sigmoidal Flux Rope

Examination of series of AIA 94 ˚A images suggests expansion of the sigmoidal
ﬂux rope structure after ≈ 07:00 UT which subsequently proceeds with its com-
plete eruption. For a clear visualisation of the sigmoidal ﬂux rope eruption, a
series of AIA 94 ˚A running diﬀerence images are presented in Figure 8. It is
observed that the eruption of the ﬂux rope starts in the precursor phase at ≈
07:03 UT in the northwest direction with two erupting fronts, which we call
as the leading front (red arrows in Figures 8c and d) and the following front
(black arrows in Figures 8c and d). The eruption of the leading front is clearly
visible for an extended time interval encompassing the precursor and impulsive
phases of the ﬂare. However, the signatures of expanding following front are
hard to distinguish during the impulsive phase and subsequently diminishes. The
leading edge of the ﬂux rope is shown by red arrows in Figure 8d. Coincidently,
the leading front of the erupting ﬂux rope is associated with the “elbow” of the
sigmoidal structure. Unlike the leading edge, the eruption of the central region
of the sigmoidal structure is much less pronounced during the precursor and
main phases of the ﬂare. Hence, to understand the kinematic evolution of the
ﬂux rope at the source region we consider the height-time measurements of the
leading front.

between ≈ 06:54 UT and ≈ 07:20 UT. Two arrows in panel (c) show the two erupting fronts
of the sigmoid. Arrows in panel (d) show the eruption of the sigmoid fronts.

In order to investigate the evolution of the sigmoidal ﬂux rope eruption, we
plot a time-slice diagram for the duration 07:00 UT to 07:29 UT (Figure 9) which
include both the precursor and impulsive phases of the ﬂare. For the purpose, we
have choosen a narrow slit S2S1 (Figure 9). Notably, the eruption of the leading
front of the ﬂux rope was observed to follow this path. The time-evolution of
this slit is presented in Figure 9b. For comparing the ascent of the ﬂux rope
with the evolutionary phases of the ﬂare, we overplot the GOES SXR ﬂux in
1–8 ˚A channel (shown by red curve in Figure 9b) which readily suggests that
during the precursor phase of the ﬂare i.e. ≈ 07:00 UT–07:17 UT, the ﬂux rope
undergoes through a slow rise with a linear speed ≈ 15 km s−1. After ≈ 07:17
UT i.e. as the ﬂare enters into the impulsive phase, the ﬂux rope attains an
acceleration phase with sudden rise in its speed to ≈ 110 km s−1.

observed a slow rise of the ﬂux rope with linear speed 15 km s−1. As the ﬂare entered into the
impulsive phase, the ﬂux rope eruption accelerated to high linear speed of ≈ 110 km s−1.

3.6. Multi-wavelength Flare Evolution

In Figure 10, we present a series of a few selected AIA 94 ˚A images showing
the evolution of the AR during diﬀerent phases of the M1.2 ﬂare. A clear erupt-
ing loop-like structure can be identiﬁed in Figure 10b. With the onset of the
impulsive phase (i.e. from ≈ 07:17 UT), we observed a set of parallel ribbons
(indicated as Rb1 and Rb2 in Figure 10d) which are situated on both sides of the
PIL. With the evolution of the ﬂare, the brightness of the ribbons enhances. Also,
the separation between them increases. During the gradual phase, we observed
formation of highly structured post-ﬂare arcade encompassing the entire active
region (Figures 10f–i).

The AIA 304 ˚A images clearly show ﬁlaments in the precursor phase and their
subsequent evolution during the M-class ﬂare. In Figure 11, we show a series
of AIA 304 ˚A images. To show the distribution of the positive and negative
polarities of the photospheric ﬂux, HMI LOS magnetogram is overplotted in
Figures 11a and e. We noticed the existance of two ﬁlaments along the PIL: F1
in the northern part (white arrows in Figure 11a) and F2 in the southern part
(green arrows in Figure 11a) of the AR. Filament F1 coincides with the “elbow”
of the sigmoidal structure implying a close spatial association with the sigmoid
(cf. Figures 10 and 11). Filament F2 is situated far from the sigmoid, but within
the AR. It is noticed that the ﬁlament F1 activates and undergoes through
eruption during the precursor phase (white arrows in Figure 11b). However,
no signiﬁcant changes are observed in the ﬁlament F2. The activation of the
ﬁlament F1 starts at ≈ 07:13 UT and it successfully erupts by ≈ 07:20 UT.
Afterward, we noticed the development of two-ribbon ﬂare (Figure 11d). As

discussed earlier, the increasing seperation between the ribbons can clealy be

post-ﬂare loop arcade start to appear from ≈ 08:19 UT (Figure 11i).

in 1–8 ˚A wavelength channel within the same time axis (shown by white curve).
From Figure 12, we readily observe that during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare,

a type III solar radio burst occurs at ≈ 07:24 UT. This type III burst is followed
by a split-band type II solar radio burst during ≈ 07:26 UT–07:29 UT. The
fundamental band of type II burst is observed with starting frequency of ≈ 173
MHz. Using the observations of fundamental band, we have calculated the shock
parameters using the Gopalswamy model (Gopalswamy et al., 2013). The shock
speed is estimated as ≈ 1143 km s−1 and the average height of shock formation
is ≈ 1.32 R(cid:12). The eruptive ﬂare, however, lacked solar proton event.

3.8. CME in the near-Sun region

According to SOHO/LASCO CME catalogue, the ﬂux rope eruption is associ-
ated with a halo CME which is detected by the LASCO C2 and C3 coronagraph
(Figure 13). The height-time plot corresponding to the CME within the LASCO
FOV is provided in Figure 14. The CME is ﬁrst detected in the LASCO C2
coronagraph at 07:36 UT at a height of ≈ 2.76 R(cid:12) and is visible in C2 till 08:00
UT (the C2 data points are denoted by asterisk symbol (*) in Figures 14a and
b). The CME is observed till 10:42 UT by C3, when it reached the height of 20.36
R(cid:12) (denoted by diamond symbols in Figures 14a and b). By applying a linear
ﬁt to the height-time data points (Figure 14a), we calculate the linear speed of
the CME to be ≈ 1085 km s−1. By using second order ﬁt to the height-time
data points, the acceleration of the CME is estimated as ≈ -41.68 m s−2. Thus,
we can infer that the ﬂux rope eruption led to a deccelerated high speed halo

CME. The speed of the CME is calculated as ≈ 855 km s−1 at a height of 20
R(cid:12).

4. Discussion

We study the formation of a transient coronal sigmoid and its subsequent disrup-
tion which led to an M-class ﬂare and fast halo CME. The activities occurred in
the AR 11909 on 07 December 2013. We summarize the chronology of the event
in Table 1.

We have observed the build-up and formation phase of a transient coronal
sigmoid, an evidence of magnetic ﬂux rope, in hot EUV channel of 94 ˚A. The AIA
94 ˚A observations cleary reveal that the formation process of coronal sigmoid
witnessed the joining of two twisted loop-like structures with an overall enhance-
ment in the brighteness which likely suggests that reconnection-coupling of the
two ﬂux ropes resulted into the build-up of a large sigmoidal ﬂux rope. About ≈
20 min after the complete formation of the coronal sigmoid, the eruptive activi-
ties started from the region which ultimately led to a two-ribbon ﬂare and fast
CME (≈ 1085 km s−1). The eruption of sigmoidal ﬂux rope caused large-scale
restructuring of the active region corona and typical “sigmoid-to-arcade” trans-
formation is observed. Transient sigmoids imply those sigmoids which appear for
a shorter time duration and usually observed to form prior to an eruptive ﬂare
(see e.g. Pevtsov, Canﬁeld, and Zirin, 1996; Joshi et al., 2017a). To understand
the evolution of the sigmoidal ﬂux rope in the AR, we have explored the coupling
between diﬀerent lower atmospheric layers i.e photosphere, chromosphere, and
transition region. The observations of the chromosphere and transition region
in Hα (Figure 1c) and AIA 304 ˚A channels (Figure 11) indicate the existence
of two ﬁlaments along the PIL. Filament F1 coincides with the sigmoid. Due
to the spatial correspondance of ﬁlament (F1) and sigmoid, we can infer that
both features correspond to the same ﬂux rope. Notably, ﬁlament F1 completely
erupts with the eruptive-expansion of the sigmoidal ﬂux rope. The existance of
the ﬁlament has been widely accepted as evidence of the magnetic ﬂux rope
(e.g. Joshi et al., 2017a, 2018; Mitra et al., 2020; Sahu et al., 2020). Through the

km s−1 while the second order ﬁt in panel (b) shows that the CME is deccelerating with
acceleration of ≈ 41.68 m s−2.

analysis of the HMI magnetogram, we observed the moving magnetic features
along with magnetic ﬁeld changes near the PIL. These features are supposed to
play important roles in the formation of ﬂux rope and its subsequent eruption
(e.g. Joshi et al., 2011; Kushwaha et al., 2014; Vasantharaju et al., 2019; Mitra,
Joshi, and Prasad, 2020).

The photospheric observations of the AR also depicts the ﬂux cancellation
near the PIL. As a consequence, we found a decrease in the net ﬂux of the AR. It
is likely that the ﬂux cancellation would lead to the tether-cutting reconnection
(Moore and Roumeliotis, 1992; Moore et al., 2001) among opposite polarity
foot points of the low-lying short loops that are rooted just across the PIL
thereby facilitating the development of the ﬂux ropes. With the progression
of the build-up phase of the sigmoid, the ﬂux rope acquires a large amount
of magnetic free enery, which is released during the magnetic reconnection in
the form of solar ﬂares and CMEs (e.g. Mitra et al., 2018; Mitra, Joshi, and
Prasad, 2020). The AIA 94 ˚A images suggest the coupling of two twisted loop-
like structures during the build-up phase of the coronal sigmoid which correlates
with our interpretation of observed ﬂux cancellation process close to the PIL.
Successful eruption of the ﬂux rope is found to be followed by a two-ribbon solar
ﬂare of M1.2 class. The increasing separation between the ﬂare ribbons is also
noticed in the study. The ﬂare ribbons represent the foot-points of the coronal
loops involved in the coronal magnetic reconnection process (e.g. see, Veronig
et al., 2006; Joshi et al., 2007, 2009). With the progression of a solar ﬂare, the
coronal loops rooted at the opposite polarity sides of the conjugate ﬂare ribbons
evolve from ‘stressed’ conﬁguration to nearly potential state (Joshi et al., 2017b).
The appearance of the sigmoidal structure in the AR is considered as a pro-
genitor of CMEs in the source region (Canﬁeld, Hudson, and Pevtsov, 2000).
The early evolution of the CMEs is associated with the activation of the ﬂux
rope. In this regard, we would like to further emphasize the two-phase evolution
of the sigmoidal ﬂux rope: slow rise and fast rise. The early dynamical evolution
of the ﬂux rope is identiﬁed by slow rise phase with a speed of ≈ 15 km s−1
which points toward the initiation phase of the CME (Zhang et al., 2001; Joshi
et al., 2016; Mitra and Joshi, 2019). The evolution of the ﬂux rope undergoes
sudden transition from state of slow rise to fast rise with the drastic increase
of its eruption speed to ≈ 110 km s−1. The fast rise state essentially marks the
impulsive acceleration phase of the CME (Zhang et al., 2001). Our measurement
of the ﬂux rope speed during its eruptive phase is in agreement with the speeds of
plasmoids, reported mainly during the limb events (e.g. Manoharan and Kundu,
2003; Joshi et al., 2016). Notably, the slow and fast rise phases of the sigmoidal
ﬂux rope are well correlated with the precursor and impulsive phases of the
ﬂare, respectively. In essence, the formation of transient sigmoid and activation
of EUV ﬂux rope support the scenario of the development of CME in the low
corona (see e.g. Manoharan et al., 2001; Cho et al., 2009; Joshi et al., 2018)

The radio dynamic spectrum shows the occurance of type III and type II
radio bursts during fast rise phase of the ﬂux rope or impulsive phase of the
ﬂare. Type III radio burst is observed at ≈ 07:24 UT and type II radio burst is
observed during ≈ 07:26 UT–07:29 UT. Type III radio bursts are produced due to
accelerated electrons propagating along the open magnetic ﬁeld lines (see review

SOLA: hema_ms.tex; 4 May 2021; 1:05; p. 23

H. Kharayat et al.

by Reid and Ratcliﬀe, 2014). The rapidly accelerating ﬂux rope structure would
drive a coronal shock. The type II radio burst in the frequency range of ≈ 50–300
MHz implies the fast eruption of the CME-ﬂux rope system in the lower coronal
heights (≈ 1.32 R(cid:12)). Considering the projected speed of erupting ﬂux rope as
≈ 110 km s−1 within the AIA 94 ˚A FOV (see Figure 9), the initiation time and
formation height of type II radio burst correlate with the imaging observations.
The CME is later detected on C2 coronagraph of LASCO at a height of 2.76 R(cid:12)
at 07:36 UT. Notably, the shock speed is found to be comparable to the speed
of the CME in the LASCO FOV.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we provide a multi-wavelength analysis of the build-up phase
of a sigmoidal ﬂux rope in the corona and its subsequent “sigmoid-to-arcade”
transformation. Notably, the sigmoid studied here is of transient category and its
disruption started just ≈ 20 min after its complete formation. The coronal sig-
moid is associated with a simple β-type AR which posseses relatively weaker and
dispersed magnetic ﬂux regions. Notably, both legs of the sigmoid are rooted in
the magnetically dispersed regions, devoid of sunspots. The photospheric moving
magnetic features and ﬂux cancellation events are observed during the build-
up phase of the sigmoid as well as its post-formation phase when the eruptive
activities set-in. In particular, the observed ﬂux cancellation near the PIL has
important bearing toward the strengthening and subsequent activation of the
magnetic ﬂux rope by tether-cutting magnetic reconnections. These small-scale,
episodic reconnection events will also contribute toward plasma heating which
enhances the temperature of the newly formed ﬂux rope. At this pre-eruption
stage, the ﬂux rope starts to become visible in SXR and hot EUV channels. The
“sigmoid-to-arcade” transformation accompanies a classical two-ribbon ﬂare (of
GOES M1.2 class) and a fast CME (≈ 1085 km s−1). The two-phase evolution
of the ﬂux rope clearly bifurcates the precursor and impulsive phases of the solar
ﬂare, which points toward the activation of ﬂux rope by tether-cutting process
and subsequent large-scale reconnection driven by expanding CME in the source
region.
