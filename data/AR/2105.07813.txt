Tidal deformability of neutron stars with exotic particles within a
density dependent relativistic mean ﬁeld model in R-squared gravity

K Nobleson, Tuhin Malik, and Sarmistha Banik

July 7, 2021

Abstract

There is a growing interest in investigating modiﬁed theories of gravity, primarily, with the aim
of explaining the universe’s accelerated expansion, which has been conﬁrmed by several independent
observations. Compact objects, like neutron stars, exhibit strong gravity eﬀects and therefore are used to
study modiﬁed gravity theories. We use the f (R) = R + aR2
model, where R is the Ricci scalar and a is
a free parameter. This model has been studied both perturbatively and non-perturbatively. However, it
was found that perturbative methods results in nonphysical solutions for the neutron stars. In this paper,
we examine neutron star properties, such as mass, radius, tidal deformability in non-perturbative f (R)
gravity model with density dependent relativistic equation of state with diﬀerent particle compositions.
The strange particles in the core of NS in the form of Λ hyperons, K −
condensate, and quarks are
considered. We have observed that while the mass-radius relation allows for a wide range of parameter
a, when tidal deformability is considered, the parameter a is constrained down by one order.

1 Introduction

Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity (GR) [1] has been the most inﬂuential theory of the twentieth century,
providing the most logical explanation of the Universe at large scales. It, along with the Standard Model
of particle physics, constitutes the ”Grand Uniﬁed Theory” from which all physics can be derived. The
most important insight of GR is that it deﬁnes gravity, one of the fundamental forces, not as a force but
as an intrinsic property of space-time that results from viewing the Universe as a geometric manifold. The
conceptual complications in quantizing Einstein’s theory, as well as, the astrophysical ﬁndings of accelerated
expansion of universe, indicated that GR might need to be modiﬁed.

In the recent years, there has been a lot of interest in studying modiﬁed theories of gravity, primarily
with the intention of ﬁnding physical explanations for the universe’s accelerated expansion, which has been
validated by many independent observations [2]. The cosmological constant is the simplest solution that can
be made consistent with recent observations of cosmic acceleration. However, the ﬁeld theoretic understanding
of cosmological constant is far from satisfactory, and its magnitude is signiﬁcantly smaller than predicted,
resulting in the well-known coincidence and ﬁne-tuning problems. To address this problem, many approaches
have been proposed in the literature [3]. The two most popular approaches that have been used are
either
introducing an additional scalar ﬁeld or replacing the Ricci scalar R in Einstein-Hilbert action with a general
function of the Ricci scalar f (R) [4]. The additional scalar degree of freedom in both formulations can
be conﬁgured to simulate the cosmological constant or any type of plausible cosmological evolution at any
cosmological scale. The functional form of f (R) = R + aR2 is used in this study. The modiﬁed theories
of gravity are well-motivated and compatible with observational evidence without the requirement of the
addition of a previously undetected component of matter. Such modiﬁcations, on the other hand, should
be subjected to all the astrophysical tests before being approved or dismissed. These models are veriﬁed
for their feasibility in the weak gravity regime by the laboratory tests [5] and solar system tests. However,
any coherent theory of gravity, whether classical or modiﬁed, should adhere to the strong gravity regime as
well. Compact stars, such as neutron stars, are ideal for studying strong gravity, high-energy nuclear physics,
QCD under extreme conditions, and putting alternate theories of gravity to the test, among other things.

In general, the equations in the f (R) model can be solved using two approaches: a) perturbative approach,
b) non-perturbative approach. In perturbative approach, the f (R) theories are considered as perturbation

 
 
 
 
 
 
to GR and the next to the leading order terms in a larger expansion are used to treat the diﬃculty of
ﬁeld equations [6–9]. In non-perturbative approach, the equations are solved self-consistently by solving the
interior and exterior equations with appropriate boundary conditions [10, 11]. Since, in the perturbative
approach, the interior and exterior solutions are not solved simultaneously and the allowed values of a can be
negative, it was argued in [10] that solutions in this method would yield non-physical results for the NS. In
order to avoid tachyonic instabilities and non-physical results, we use non-perturbative method to examine
the existence and properties of neutron star (NS) with realistic equation of state (EoS) in the context of the
f (R) model, and obtain the possible constraints on the parameter a.

The nature of high density matter in the interior of NS is still a subject of active research. The density
1017kg/m3) at the core. However, due to our limited
of NS exceeds the supra-nuclear density (ρ0 ∼
understanding beyond the saturation density, the high-density existence of nuclear matter remains unknown.
There are several models for constructing the EoS at these densities that are then modiﬁed based on nuclear
experimental ﬁndings and astrophysical observations. Usually two types of treatment exist for constructing
EoS i) Relativistic and ii) Non-relativistic. Although, non relativistic method have been extremely successful
in the description of nucleons inside atomic nuclei (ﬁnite nuclei) but for dense nuclear matter study relevant
for NS, the choice of relativistic eﬀect is more appropriate. The force or the interactions between two
nucleons is understood as the exchange of virtual particles known as mesons which transfer momentum and
energy between the two nucleons. In order to exchange them, the nucleons must be extremely close together
15m), beyond which the strong nuclear force decreases sharply and becomes
of the order of 1 Fermi (10−
almost negligible. This is the relativistic description of nuclear interaction and is the basis of all successful
models of nuclear structure. In this case, the nuclear matter is described by a Lagrangian density depicting
a many-body system. The ﬁrst ﬁeld-theoretic attempt to derive the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction via
pion-exchange was carried out by Yukawa [12] where baryons were interacting with a neutral scalar ﬁeld and
it was extended by proposing a neutral vector ﬁeld [13]. The empirical values of nuclear matter properties at
normal nuclear matter density, speciﬁcally, the binding energy, symmetry energy and its slope, eﬀective mass
of nucleons, compressibility constrain the relativistic EoSs of dense matter. Among the relativistic models,
the DD2 [14, 15] is constructed following the Walecka prescription [16] and is one of the successful models.
The interesting features of this kind of model is the high-density behaviour is considered through the density
dependence of the meson-baryon couplings. Later, this DD2 model extended nucleons with additional strange
components [17–19].

In the absence of direct evidence, the only reliable observables are its mass and radius measurements.
Since the GW170817 detection of the merger of two orbiting NS [20, 21], additional parameters like tidal
deformability (Λ) [22] is now available to study the interior of the NS. The high-density nucleus of a compact
star is believed to have more degrees of freedom than neutrons, protons, and electrons. The EoS softens in
the presence of exotic particles, resulting in an overall lower mass NS. Therefore, EoS can be constrained by
observational mass. The mass measurements of two massive pulsars, with masses of 1.928
[23]
and 2.01
[24], ruled out the soft EoS, which are incapable of supporting such a massive star.
However, a few exotic EoS comprising hyperons, antikaons, and quarks are consistent with the above ﬁndings.
GW170817, the ﬁrst observation of gravitational waves from a binary NS merger, has provided an upper
limit on tidal deformability [20, 21], which has been used by many authors to constrain the NS radius. A
comprehensive list can be found in Table 1 of the review [25]. A constraint of 9.8 < R1.4 < 13.2 km is given
in Ref [26], which is consistent with the radius measurement obtained from X-ray observations. Mass and
size data for the pulsar J0030+0451 [27] have been published by NASA’s Neutron star Interior Composition
13
Explorer (NICER). According to these studies [27,28], it has a mass of 1.3
km.

The dimensionless tidal deformability parameter can be used to decode the gravitational wave phase
evolution induced by the deformation. It is a measure of the neutron star’s response to gravitational pull
on the surface that correlates with the pressure gradient within the NS and is highly dependent on the NS
internal structure. Many authors investigated the rich connection between tidal deformability and the dense
matter EoS more intensely after the detection of gravitational waves from the GW170817 event [29–32]. To
investigate dense matter EoS, precise measurements of the Λ and radius of NS can be used as an eﬀective
probe [33].

Given an EoS, the physical properties, such as mass-radius of a NS are obtained by solving the Tolman-
Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ (TOV) equations. In f (R) formulation, a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass
distribution under hydrostatic equilibrium can be described by a set of modiﬁed TOV equations. In scalar
tensor theories of gravity these modiﬁed TOV solutions reproduce the correct behaviour at the weak gravity

2

limit as shown in [34]. Realistic EoS of the density-dependent models described above and the modiﬁed TOV
equations are used to derive the measurable properties of NS in this study.

Currently, there is an overlap in the uncertainties arising due to our lack of complete understanding of
the EoS and the free parameter of the modiﬁed gravity theories. A strong constraint of the free parameter
in the modiﬁed gravity theory will improve our understanding of the EoS and vice-versa. In an earlier work
by [10], they used EoS, such as, SLY4 and APR4 to calculate the mass, radius, tidal love number (k2), in
non-perturbative f (R). In this study, we investigate this further with EoS with diﬀerent constituents, such
as, quarks, strange particles, and calculate the mass and radius for diﬀerent values of a and place an upper
bound on a based on the observational constraints. Next, we calculate the tidal deformability and constrain
the value of a further based on the observational constraint from GW170817 event.

The following is the breakdown of the paper’s structure.

In section II, we use the non-perturbative
formalism to study the ﬁeld equations of the f (R) gravity model. The modiﬁed TOV equations are derived
from the non-perturbative forms of metric functions and hydrodynamical quantities. In section III, we present
an overview of the EoS used in this work and the results of the numerical solution of mass, radius, tidal love
number, and tidal deformability for various forms of the EoS, and various values of the free parameter a.
Finally, in the conclusion section, we comment on the numerical results as well as the constraint we obtained
for the free parameter a of the f (R) gravity model.

In comparison to the Jordan frame, the Einstein frame’s ﬁeld equations are much simpler. The appearance of
direct interaction between the scalar ﬁeld varphi and the matter ﬁelds in Einstein frame comes at a cost for
simplifying the action and the ﬁeld equations in this frame. By taking variation with respect to the metric
g∗µν and the scalar ﬁeld ϕ, the ﬁeld equations in the Einstein frame are derived. The ﬁnal quantities that we
obtain have to be transformed back to the physical Jordan frame. In addition, the equation of state of the
nuclear matter that we use will also be only in the Jordan frame [10].

The Jordan frame quantities ρ and p are naturally connected via the EoS of the neutron star matter p = p(ρ).
Furthermore, we should impose the standard boundary conditions – regularity at the star’s center and
asymptotic ﬂatness at inﬁnity. The equations describing the spacetime metric and the scalar ﬁeld outside
the neutron star are obtained by setting ρ = p = 0. In order to solve our systems of diﬀerential equations
for the interior and the exterior of the neutron star, we should provide the EoS for the neutron star matter
p = p(ρ) and impose the boundary conditions. We solve the interior and the exterior problems together using
the natural Einstein frame boundary conditions at the center of the star which are as follows:

At inﬁnity,

ρ(0) = ρc,

λ(0) = 0,

(0) = 0

φ(r) = 0,

(24)

(25)

To get the neutron star mass and radius, we need to solve numerically the equations (20, 21 and 23) together
with the boundary conditions equations (24) - (25) from center to surface of the star and then surface to
inﬁnity. In order to integrate those coupled diﬀerential equations from center of the star, we need to ﬁx the
value of φ for each central density of the star at the center such that it should exponentially decay and go
to zero at inﬁnity. The behaviour of φ with integrating radius can be seen in ﬁg 5 of Ref. [11]. The radius
of the star is calculated from the requirement of pressure vanishing at the stellar surface and the mass is
taken from the asymptotic expansion of the metric functions at inﬁnity. In Einstein frame, the star mass

It is important to note that for the considered R-squared gravity the mass in the Einstein and the Jordan
frame coincide, while the physical Jordan frame radius of the star RS is connected to the Einstein frame one
rs through the following relation

RS = A(ϕ(rs))rs

(26)

The dimensions of the parameter a is in terms of r2
g, where rg = 1.47664 km corresponds to one solar mass.
The m(r) proﬁle for inside and outside star for both the Einstein and the Jordan frame can be seen in ﬁg 4
of Ref. [11].

2.1 Tidal Love number

Consider a static, spherically symmetric star in R-squared gravity. The stationary perturbations of the metric
can be separated into magnetic/axial and electric/polar types. In this study, we will calculate only the tidal
Love number for the polar type and its corresponding tidal deformability. Even though the absolute value of
the axial Tidal Love Number can increase dramatically in R-squared gravity [37], recent estimates indicate
that they would have no observable impact on the gravitational wave signal, even for the next generation of
gravitational wave detectors [38].

applied to the case here since the equations for H and δ ˜ϕ are coupled and, in general, there exists no analytical
solution outside the star. Since we know that the scalar ﬁeld is massive, the problem is simpliﬁed. Since
the scalar ﬁeld and its perturbation die out exponentially at distances larger than the Compton wavelength
of the scalar ﬁeld λϕ = 2π/mϕ = 2π√6a, the analytical solution of GR can be used. The inner and outer
solutions are matched at a radius rmatch where the scalar ﬁeld and its perturbation are negligible rather than
at the stellar surface. Since rmatch is connected to the Compton wavelength of the scalar ﬁeld, rmatch is not
a constant but a function of the parameter a. For l = 2, we obtain

To compute this polar tidal love number numerically, we need to solve the simultaneous second order
diﬀerential equations 28 and 29 with some initial values for H, dH/dr. δϕ and dδϕ/dr at the center of the
neutron star. We have used χ2 minimization method to arrive at values for δϕ at the center of the star such
that the perturbation exponentially decays to the neighborhood of zero around the Compton wavelength.

For the values of a, it is only reasonable to assume that the scalar ﬁeld’s Compton wavelength to be smaller
than the orbital separation between merging neutron stars at the time when the ground-based detectors
are sensitive to observe and calculate the tidal deformability. Assuming that we can detect the emitted
gravitational waves with current instruments when the orbital separation decreases to a few hundreds of

3 Results

3.1 Neutron Star Model EoS

The motivation of this work is to investigate the eﬀect of strangeness on the properties of NS in modiﬁed
gravity. The interior temperature of the NS is low compared to the Fermi energy of the constituent fermions.
Hence the dense matter relevant to the NS core can be modeled in terms of zero temperature EoS. We consider
EoS corresponding to dense matter with A) nucleons only B) nucleons with additional strange components.
All the models considered in this work obey the mass-radius constraints of astrophysical observations [23,24,
40].

Nuclear EoS
Ideally, the dense matter in the NS core consists of neutron, protons, and electrons and is represented
by nucleonic EoS. We consider HS(DD2) EoS, an EoS based on relativistic mean ﬁeld model with density-
dependent parameter set [14, 15]. HS(DD2) is uniﬁed EoS in the sense that it employs the same Lagrangian
density to describe low-density crust as well as the high-density core and allows a smooth transition between
the core and crust. The non-homogeneous matter consists of an ensemble of nuclei and nucleons and is
described within the framework of the nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) model whereas the strong nucleon-
nucleon interaction in the uniform dense nuclear matter part is mediated by exchanges of scalar σ, vector
ω and ρ mesons [14, 41]. The high-density behaviour is considered through the density dependence of the
meson-baryon couplings. The saturation density, mass of σ meson, couplings at the saturation density,
obtained by ﬁtting properties of ﬁnite nuclei is known as the DD2 parameter set. Nuclear matter properties
at the saturation density are compatible with those obtained from nuclear physics experiments [41].

Strange EoS
The high-density core of the NS is hypothesized to be populated with strange hadrons such as antikaon
condensates, Λ hyperons and even quark matter under tremendous pressure. The onset of a new degree of
freedom softens the EoS and supports a star that is less massive and less compact compared to the ones
comprising of only nucleons. We consider three strange EoS consisting of i) Λ hyperons (BHBΛφ) [17], ii)
Λ hyperons and K − mesons (BHBΛφK −) [18] and iii) 2 ﬂavor quark matter (DD2-FRG) [19] in addition to
the nucleons. All three hybrid EoS are constructed from the HS(DD2) EoS for hadronic matter.

The Λ hyperon is populated when its in-medium chemical potential matches that of neutron. The
density-dependent Λ-vector meson hyperon couplings are obtained from the SU(6) symmetry of the quark
√2
model [42, 43] i.e. gωΛ = 2
3 gωN . On the other hand, the scalar meson coupling
to Λ hyperons are determined from their potential depth (-30MeV) in normal nuclear matter, obtained from
the experimental data of the single particle spectra of Λ hypernuclei. Other baryons of the octet are not
considered mainly due to the uncertainty in their experimental data. This EoS is known as BHBΛφ EoS.

Figure 3: Tidal Love Number (k2) versus Compactness (C) for density-dependent EoS under study

In the BHBΛφK − EoS, the kaon-nucleon interaction is considered in the same footing as the nucleon-
nucleon interaction. The K − condensate appears in the system when its in-medium energy equals to its
chemical potential given by µK− = µn
µp. The kaon-meson couplings do not depend on density and are
constants. They are estimated exploiting the quark model and iso-spin counting rule, i.e., gωK = 1
3 gωN and
gρK = gρN [43, 44]. The scalar coupling constant is determined from the real part of K − optical potential at
the saturation density, which we take as -120 MeV.

Finally, we consider DD2-FRG EoS for quark matter constructed within a model based on the underlying
chiral symmetry breaking of QCD. This is a non-perturbative two- and three-ﬂavored quark model obtained
with the functional renormalization group (FRG) [19]. The maximum hybrid star mass of about 2.1M
for
the two-ﬂavor model complies well with current mass observations, whereas the strange quark model does
not satisfy the mass limit. So in our calculation we used the two-ﬂavored DD2-FRG EoS. For the HS(DD2)
EoS, the GW170817 tidal deformability is ˜Λ
795 for a mass ratio of 0.8 of the two coalescing stars. This
value does not change signiﬁcantly for both the hybrid EoS as the quark matter onset occurs only for masses
slightly below 1.8M

and higher.

The above-mentioned EoSs are plotted in ﬁg. 1. The nucleonic HS(DD2) EoS is denoted by solid black
line. The other curves represent EoS containing additional exotic particles such as Λ hyperons (BHBΛφ),
Λ hyperons and anti(kaon) condensates (BHBΛφK −) and quarks (DD2-FRG) in the HS(DD2) model. The
addition of strange particles softens the EoS. The DD2-FRG is evidently the softest of the lot.

For GR, we derive and solve the TOV equations for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating neutron star
to obtain the mass and radius given an EoS and appropriate boundary conditions. For a chosen central
pressure P(0) and ǫ(0), we integrate from the center to the surface of NS with boundary conditions at the
center [m(0)=0] and on the surface [P(Rs)=0], total mass [M=m(Rs)] enclosed in the star of radius Rs. In
ﬁg. 2, we represent these using black solid lines. The four panels are for the four RMF EoS, mentioned above.
A comparison of these four mass-radius curves clearly shows the eﬀect of strangeness. Softer the EoS, lower
is the maximum mass, it can support. All of them are above 2M
for HS(DD2).

maximum masses in GR is in the range of 9.92 to 12.56 km.

Spherically symmetric conﬁgurations are obtained by solving the modiﬁed TOV equations [20-23] for
the R-squared gravity model in non-perturbative formalism for the same set of realistic EoS. The numerical
integration of the coupled diﬀerential equations are done using RK4 method with a step size of 0.001 km
and employing spline interpolation to obtain the intermediate energy densities. The mass and corresponding
radius for each entry of the EoS are calculated to plot the corresponding mass-radius relations. This procedure
is repeated for the value of a = 10, 50, and 100 and the diﬀerent EoS used in this study. For a = 10, the
radius corresponding to the maximum mass is in the range of 10.75
12.97 km; for a = 50, it is in the range
of 11.06
13.39 km. For each EoS as a increases the mass
13.27 km; for a = 100, it is in the range of 11.13
and radius of the neutron star increase compared to the GR mass and radius of the corresponding EoS. As
evident from the table 1, the radius of NS at 1.4 M
(M1.4) for all a is also well within the bounds of NICER
results (13.02+1.24
1.06) [28]. For the four EoS considered in this study, the change in maximum mass of NS with

4 Conclusion

In the recent years, there is an increasing interest in studying modiﬁed gravity theories, mainly to understand
the universe’s rapid expansion, which has been supported by many independent observations [2]. The modiﬁed
theories of gravity are well motivated and compatible with observational evidence without requiring the
addition of an ad hoc component of matter, that have so far eluded discovery. However, such modiﬁcations
should pass all astrophysical checks before becoming approved or rejected. In the weak regime, the solar
system test and laboratory experiments are used to verify the validity of the majority of these models.
However, compact stars, such as neutron stars, form excellent models for testing the impact of modiﬁed
gravity in the strong regime [5].

The investigation of the EoS at supra-nuclear densities is still an open problem as we do not know the
nature of nuclear interactions at these densities. One approach employed is to try diﬀerent nuclear models
and construct the dense matter EoS relevant to NS. The EoS is then used to to calculate various structure
in GR. The EoS that satisfy
properties such as mass, radius, tidal deformability, moment of inertia, etc.
the astrophysical observations are accepted. The other approach is to modify GR to see its eﬀect on the NS
properties. Currently, the diﬀerence between the R-squared gravity and GR overlap with the uncertainties in
the EoS which clouds our understanding [10]. Any information that aids in constraining the free parameter
’a’ in R-squared gravity will help us better understand the above-mentioned uncertainties.

In this work, we used the non-perturbative approach in R-squared gravity to derive the modiﬁed TOV
equations to study spherically symmetric, non-rotating neutron stars [10]. For this, we consider relativistic
mean ﬁeld EoS with density-dependent couplings [HS(DD2)] model EoS. As our objective is to study the
eﬀect of exotic particles such as (Λ, K −, and quark) in modiﬁed gravity, we consider EoS based on DD2
model. The nucleonic as well as the exotic EoS satisfy the maximum mass constraints of NS. We explored
the mass versus radius, compactness versus k2, and mass versus tidal deformability relations for EoS. We
found that while the addition of exotic particles reduces the maximum mass for all a > 0, the addition of Λ
and K − reduces the Λ1.4 for a > 0, whereas, the addition of quarks increases the Λ1.4. The maximum-mass
constraint allows a wide range of values for a (from 0-100) in R-squared gravity. To improve upon this, we
further investigated the allowed range of values for a using the tidal deformability in the light of results from
GW170817 [21].

We are able to constrain the value of a to be less than 10 for the type of EoS considered in this study.

11

We have conﬁned our attention to the EoS based on density-dependent relativistic mean ﬁeld model with
nucleonic as well as exotic degrees of freedom. For any given a > 0, the tidal deformability in f(R) is always
greater than that in GR. Some very soft EoS may satisfy the observational limits of tidal deformability in
f(R), but not in GR. However, they can never meet the maximum mass criteria and therefore will be ruled
out. In future, we would like to extend this work in a model-independent approach by considering diﬀerent
family of EoSs to study various universal relations, such as the “I-Love-Q” and “C-Love” relations [45, 46] in
the framework of f (R) Gravity, which is already well explored in GR.
