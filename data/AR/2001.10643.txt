ABSTRACT

We report X-ray spectroscopic results for four giant solar ﬂares occurred on 2005 September 7 (X17.0),
2005 September 8 (X5.4), 2005 September 9 (X6.2), and 2006 December 5 (X9.0), obtained from Earth
albedo data with the X-ray imaging spectrometer (XIS) onboard Suzaku. The good energy resolution
of the XIS (FWHM∼100 eV) enables us to separate a number of line-like features and detect the
underlying continuum emission. These features include Si Heα, Si Lyα, S Heα, S Lyα, Ar Heα,
and Ca Heα originating from solar ﬂares as well as ﬂuorescent Ar Kα and Ar Kβ from the Earth
atmosphere. Absolute elemental abundances (X/H) averaged over the four ﬂares are obtained to
be ∼2.0 (Ca), ∼0.7 (Si), ∼0.3 (S), and ∼0.9 (Ar) at around ﬂare peaks. This abundance pattern
is similar to those of active stars’ coronae showing inverse ﬁrst ionization potential (i-FIP) eﬀects,
i.e., elemental abundances decrease with decreasing FIP with a turnover at the low end of FIP. The
abundances are almost constant during the ﬂares, with an exception of Si which increases by a factor
of ∼2 in the decay phase. The evolution of the Si abundance is consistent with a picture that the i-FIP
plasma originates from the chromosphere evaporation and then mixes with the surrounding low-FIP
biased materials. Flare-to-ﬂare abundance varied by a factor of 2, agreeing with past observations of
solar ﬂares. Finally, we emphasize that Earth albedo data acquired by X-ray astronomy satellites like
Suzaku and XRISM can signiﬁcantly contribute to studies of solar physics.

1. INTRODUCTION

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

The plasma composition is one of the keys to understanding the physical processes associated with mechanisms
to transport, heat, and accelerate the plasma in the solar atmosphere. In the last half of the 20th century, it has
been revealed that the elemental composition of the solar corona is diﬀerent from that of the underlying photosphere
by extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray spectroscopy of the solar corona as well as in-situ measurements of solar-energetic
particles and solar winds. The discrepancy is understood to be caused by a dependence on the ﬁrst ionization potential
(FIP) of the element (e.g., Meyer 1985; Schmelz et al. 2012; Reames 2018). In the corona, elements with low FIP (.
10 eV) are enhanced by a factor of 2–4 comapred with the photospheric abundances (e.g., Feldman 1992; Dennis et al.
2015).1 This is widely known as the “FIP eﬀect”, but its mechanism has been one of the most enduring mysteries of
solar physics, besides the well-known coronal heating problem.

It has been shown that coronae of inactive stars exhibit similar solar-like FIP eﬀects (Drake et al. 1997; Laming & Drake

1999). In contrast, later spectral types with stronger magnetic ﬁelds show an “inverse FIP (i-FIP) eﬀect”, i.e., low-FIP
elements are under-abundant relative to high-FIP elements (e.g., Brinkman et al. 2001; G¨udel et al. 2001; Audard et al.
2003; Huenemoerder et al. 2003; Sanz-Forcada et al. 2003; Argiroﬃ et al. 2004). There is a clear relation between the
FIP bias (deﬁned by the ratio of elemental abundance in the corona to that in the photosphere) and the spectral
type; early G stars all have a solar-like FIP eﬀect, which decreases toward early K stars, reaching no FIP eﬀect at
about K5, and then reverses to the i-FIP eﬀect for later than K stars with the magnitude of the eﬀect increasing
with spectral type (Wood & Linsky 2010; Wood et al. 2018). For active stars showing i-FIP eﬀects, the abundances
decrease with decreasing FIP. However, there is emerging evidence that a turnover occurs at a very low FIP below
which the elemental abundances steeply increase (e.g., Huenemoerder et al. 2013). The origin of the turnover remains
unclear.
f Substantial eﬀorts have been devoted to interpret the FIP fractionation and there is a consensus that
the fractionation results from a separation of ions and neutrals in the upper chromosphere with a temperature of
6000–10000 K, where low-FIP elements are ionized but high-FIP elements are mostly in neutral states. Among several
theoretical models proposed (e.g., Henoux et al. 1998), the only model that can explain both FIP and i-FIP eﬀects is
the Laming model, which is involved in ponderomotive forces, a nonlineaer force that a charged particle experiences
in an inhomogeneous oscillating electromagnetic ﬁeld (Laming 2004, 2009, 2012, 2015). Ponderomotive forces in the
chromosphere may in principle be directed upward or downward, resulting in FIP and i-FIP eﬀects, respectively.
Since upward ponderomotive forces are common in solar condition, i.e., the Alfven wave energy ﬂux through the
chromosphere is nonzero (see Section 3.2 in Laming 2004, for more details), we generally see enhancements of low-FIP
elements in the solar corona. In coronal holes with open-ﬁeld lines, upward ponderomotive forces are expected to
become very weak, and thus a very low FIP eﬀect is expected there, which is indeed observed (Feldman & Widing
1993). In sunspots, where p-mode waves probably convert to fastmode waves and the fastmode waves get reﬂected back
toward the chromosphere (Laming 2015), downward ponderomotive forces are expected. Therefore, it is reasonable
that i-FIP eﬀects are observed in magnetically active stars whose surfaces are largely covered by starspots.

Elemental abundances during solar ﬂares have been reported to be coronal or intermediate between the coronal
and photospheric values (Sterling et al. 1993; Sylwester et al. 1998; Fludra & Schmelz 1999; Phillips & Dennis 2012;
Narendranath et al. 2014; Sylwester et al. 2015; Dennis et al. 2015). However, it was recently realized that the abun-
dance pattern is diﬀerent from coronal abundances, in that the boundary between low-FIP and high-FIP elements
is about 7 eV (Dennis et al. 2015), signiﬁcantly less than ∼10 eV that is normally observed for solar coronae or solar
energetic particles. This implies that the fractionation of ﬂare plasmas are cool and expected to be in lower chromo-
spheric altitudes than that of the normal coronal plasma. In fact, a few observations of solar ﬂares showed nearly
photospheric abundances (Veck & Parkinson 1981; Warren 2014), indicating that the bulk of the plasma evaporated
during a ﬂare comes from deep in the chromosphere (Warren 2014).

Recently, Doschek et al. (2015) discovered the i-FIP eﬀect on the Sun, for the ﬁrst time. They found unexpectedly
high Ar XIV / Ca XIV intensity ratios in small regions near sunspots during solar ﬂares. Since Ar and Ca are high- and
low-FIP elements, respectively, the result agrees with the prediction of the Laming model. One important question is
whether the i-FIP eﬀect is caused by an enhancement of the high-FIP element or a depletion of the low-FIP element.
In the Laming model, we expect the latter case, because the ponderomotive force is eﬀective only to low-FIP elements.
Doschek & Warren (2016) estimated the path length of the plasma to be smaller than what is expected for the plasma
with photospheric abundances, suggesting the depletion of the low-FIP elements. More recently, Brooks (2018) pointed
out that coronal loops showing i-FIP eﬀects persisted for ∼40 minutes, which is more than a factor of four longer than
the lifetime of the other loops exhibiting normal FIP eﬀects. This indicates the depletion of the low-FIP elements in

1 However, it has been still debated whether low-FIP elements are enhanced or high-FIP elements are depleted relative to the photospheric

values (e.g., Veck & Parkinson 1981; Raymond et al. 1997).

the i-FIP regions.

Suzaku was the ﬁfth in a series of Japanese X-ray astronomy satellites, launched on 2005 July 10 (Mitsuda et al.
2007). It was devoted to observations of celestial X-ray sources, whereas a large amount of Earth albedo of the solar
X-ray emission was observed as a by-product, because of its low Earth orbit at 550 km altitude combined with the 3-D
ﬁxed attitude during each observation. The Earth albedo data were obtained almost every orbit or ∼96 minutes, when
the telescope pointed at the bright Earth illuminated by the Sun (the duration is typically several minutes every orbit).
Therefore, Suzaku monitored the Sun throughout the 10-year lifetime of its mission with a ∼96-minutes cadence.

Suzaku carried three distinct co-aligned scientiﬁc instruments. The primary instrument was an X-ray micro-
calorimeter, which unfortunately became inoperable before performing observations due to unexpected evaporation of
liquid helium coolant in the early commissioning phase. The remaining two instruments, X-ray sensitive imaging CCD
cameras (X-ray Imaging Spectrometer, XIS: Koyama et al. 2007) and a non-imaging collimated Hard X-ray Detector
(HXD: Tanakashi et al. 2007) worked well through the entire mission. In this paper, we focus on the thermal X-ray
emission from the Sun, concentrating on the data taken by the XIS which covers an energy range of 0.2–12 keV.

We present absolute elemental abundances of Si, S, Ar, and Ca (relative to H) for four ﬂares with GOES classes from
X5.4 to X17.0, based on line-to-continuum ratios. Absolute abundances are much more diﬃcult to determine than rel-
ative abundances, because most of the hydrogen in the corona is ionized and no observable spectral lines are produced.
The amount of hydrogen (and helium) must be obtained by continuum emission. This is generally diﬃcult with so-
lar high-resolution dispersive spectrometers for several possible reasons, such as instrumental ﬂuorescence background
emission, an improper shape for instrumental spectral response (Sylwester et al. 2002). Some non-dispersive spectrom-
eters had the capability to reliably measure continuum emission, but their spectral resolutions were poor, e.g., FWHM
∼ 600 eV at 5.9 keV for MESSENGER/SAX (Dennis et al. 2015), FWHM ∼ 200 eV at 5.9 keV for Chandrayaan-1/XSM
(Narendranath et al. 2014), and FWHM ∼ 150 eV in 0.2–4 keV for Amptek/X123-SDD (Caspi et al. 2015), hampering
reliable measurements of absolute abundances. In this way, signiﬁcant systematic uncertainties still remain on coronal
absolute abundances. Thanks to the stable and low background of the XIS (Tawa et al. 2008) combined with better
spectral resolution of E/∆E ∼ 20 or FWHM∼120 eV at 3 keV than other non-dispersive spectrometers, we measured
the cleanest line-to-continuum ratios and absolute elemental abundances. We present the data and their reduction in
Section 2, and perform spectral analyses in Section 3. The results are discussed in Section 4. More details on the data
reduction and the simulation to examine spectral deformation due to Earth albedo are given in appendices 1 and 2,
respectively. The errors quoted in this paper are at the 1σ conﬁdence level, unless otherwise stated.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

Earth albedo emission observed with Suzaku/XIS is spatially unresolved, full disk integrated emission of the Sun,
and thus consists of various components such as active regions, quiet regions, and ﬂares. However, at a large, say
GOES X-class, solar ﬂare event, ﬂare emission itself dominates the observed X-ray emission by ∼90–99%, as can be
seen from the light curves and spectra in Figures 1 and 4. In such cases, we obtain nearly pure ﬂare emission. In
addition, the large X-ray ﬂuxes allow us to obtain enough photons for detailed spectroscopy. Therefore, we focus on
only large ﬂares in this paper.

Fifty nine X-class ﬂares occurred during the period when Suzaku was in operation. Among them, 14 ﬂares were
captured when Suzaku pointed at the bright Earth. Although these 14 ﬂares allow us to obtain suﬃcient photons for
our spectral analysis, we further selected early-epoch four ﬂares, i.e., Flares-1, 2, 3, and 4 occurred on 2005 September
7 (X17.0), 2005 September 8 (X5.4), 2005 September 9 (X6.2), and 2006 December 5 (X9.0), respectively. This is
because these early-epoch data have the best spectral resolution; spectral resolution of the XIS degrades with time due
to the integrated radiation damage of CCDs. Quantitatively, we set a criterion that one-sigma width of ﬂuorescent Ar
Kα is less than 50 eV. With this energy resolution, we can clearly separate ﬂuorescent Ar Kα and Ar Kβ lines, which
is necessary to measure the line intensity of the Ar Heα complex located between the two ﬂuorescences. Throughout
this paper, we use only front-illuminated CCDs, i.e., XIS0, 2, 3, because they have slightly better spectral resolution
than the back-illuminated CCD, XIS1.

Information of Suzaku observations used in this paper is summarized in Table 1. As described in Section 1, the
attitude of Suzaku is 3-D ﬁxed, and thus the scattering angle of solar X-rays at the Earth atmosphere is ﬁxed during
one observational sequence. The scattering angle can be calculated by “180 - (XRT-Sun angle) deg”, where the XRT-
Sun angle is the angle between the telescope axis and direction to the Sun. The scattering angles were close with each
other, agreeing within 7 degrees for the three observations of our interest.

4

We reprocessed the XIS data, following the standard screening criteria2 recommended by the calibration team of
Suzaku. One exception is the elevation angle, for which we changed the selection criteria from “ELV > 5 & DYE ELV
> 20” (by default) to “ELV < −10 & NTE ELV > 5” in order to extract the bright Earth data. In addition, we
developed a new method to infer better backgrounds of the XIS. We describe detailed techniques of this method in
appendix 1. Brieﬂy, the method re-estimates the dark level more precisely than the standard process does, based on
information about 16 pixels surrounding each event island. This method is also eﬀective to recover spectral resolution,
especially for the data taken during time periods showing more rapid time variation of background than the on-board
dark estimation, such as in the bright Earth observation.

Figure 1, top panels for each ﬂare section, show XIS light curves in the 1.65–5 keV band. They are averaged all over
available (two or three) front-illuminated CCDs. Middle panels show GOES X-ray light curves, and bottom panels
show elevation angles of the telescope (dashed lines) and the Sun (solid lines) measured from the Earth’s limb. In
the XIS light curves, the high-count-rate periods represent the bright Earth observation, which are conﬁrmed by the
elevation angles of the telescope and the Sun. The long-term variations of XIS light curves in the bright Earth periods
follow GOES X-ray light curves. However, there are signiﬁcant discrepancies between the XIS and GOES light curves
within individual bright Earth periods. This is because the XIS count rate in the bright Earth period is aﬀected not
only by the intrinsic solar X-ray ﬂux but also by the elevation angles of both the telescope and the Sun. Also, there
are abruptly dropping XIS data points in the bright Earth periods. These are caused by the telemetry saturation. To
check the eﬀect of the telemetry saturation, we compare spectra before and after excluding the telemery-saturation
periods for Flare-1b, as shown in Figure 2. This comparison demonstrates that the telemetry saturation does not
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the spectral shape, especially in the energy range of our interest, i.e., 1.65–5 keV. Thus, we decided
to use telemetry-saturated data in our analysis; otherwise we lost all the exposure times for Flare-1a and Flare-2a.

Our target, bright Earth during giant solar ﬂares, is indeed so bright that one may concern the pile-up eﬀects, i.e.,
more than one photons strike the same CCD pixel, which generally results in a ﬂux decrease and spectral hardening.
Maeda et al. (2009) investigated the XIS data for the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant, one of the brightest diﬀuse
X-ray sources, and concluded that pile-up does not aﬀect the XIS data. The XIS count rate of Cassiopeia A was about
118 s−1 for each front-illuminated CCD. This is comparable with that for Flare-1a which shows the maximum count
rate in the bright Earth. The emitting area of Cassiopeia A is about a radius of 3′, which is only ∼10% of the bright
Earth data extending the entire ﬁeld of view of the XIS. Therefore, the surface brightness of the bright Earth is an
order of magnitude smaller than that of Cassiopeia A, leading us to conclude that bright Earth is free from pile-up
eﬀects.

As shown in Figure 1, the four ﬂares of interest lasted much longer than Suzaku’s orbital period of 96 minutes.
Therefore, we extracted XIS spectra from a few bright Earth periods for each ﬂare (e.g., Flare-1a, Flare-1b, and
Flare-1c). The eﬀective exposure time for each spectrum is given in Table 1.

3. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

For a demonstration, we present in Figure 3 Suzaku/XIS’s bright Earth spectrum during Flare-2a. The data are
the sum of the three XIS sensors before subtracting the pre-ﬂare background which is only a 1% level of the source
in the energy range of interest (see Figure 4). There are several prominent features above the underlying continuum
emission. By ﬁtting the spectrum with eight Gaussians plus a broken power-law component, we derived the line
centroids, widths, and ﬂuxes summarized in Table 2. The line centroids allow us to identify them as Si Heα, Si Lyα,
S Heα, S Lyα, and Ca Heα features together with ﬂuorescent Ar Kα and Ar Kβ lines. The highly-ionized features
should originate from the Sun, whereas the ﬂuorescent lines should arise from the Earth atmosphere. If we expand
the energy range of the XIS spectrum, we can identify some other features including ﬂuorescent O Kα and N Kα
around 0.5 keV as well as Fe Heα complex and a possible Compton shoulder hump at ∼6.5 keV. In this paper, we will
focus only on the intermediate-mass elements, i.e., Si, S, Ar, and Ca arising from the solar ﬂares, because lines from
these elements are cleaner than those from other elements such as Mg (contaminated by instrumental Al lines) and Fe
(contaminated by emission reﬂected by the satellite). Analyses of other lines including ﬂuorescent K lines from N, O,
and Ar are ongoing, and will be presented elsewhere.

Figure 4 presents all the XIS spectra to be analyzed, i.e., the bright Earth data for the four ﬂares. The data in black
and grey are the sums of data and preﬂare backgrounds, respectively, for which we utilized only front-illuminated
CCDs. The background spectra, shown in grey in Figure 4, are taken from preﬂare bright Earth for each ﬂare. Since

5

Flare-1 and Flare-2 occurred continuously, we used the same background taken prior to Flare-1. Redistribution matrix
ﬁles (RMF) and auxiliary response ﬁles (ARF) were generated by using xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen (Ishisaki et al.
2007), respectively. Brieﬂy, the RMF is a probability map from incident photon energy space into detector’s calibrated
pulse height space, and the ARF gives eﬀective areas as a function of a photon energy. These two ﬁles are convolved
with a model spectrum to ﬁt the data. Details of the RMF and ARF are described in Section 4 in Ishisaki et al.
(2007).

3.1. Measuring Equivalent Widths

The spectral shape of solar X-ray emission is expected to be modiﬁed by the Earth atmospheric scattering. This
spectral deformation must be considered when interpreting the bright Earth data. In this work, we focus on equivalent
widths (EWs), which are not aﬀected by the spectral deformation, because both lines and their underlying continua
are equally deformed. We measured EWs directly from the original data, and converted them to absolute elemental
abundances.

We note that there is a pioneering work by Itoh et al. (2002) who analyzed the Earth albedo data obtained with
ASCA. To take into account the albedo eﬀects, they adopted the hrefl model in XSPEC (Arnaud 1996), which
was developed by Dr. Yaqoob to consider reﬂection by neutral matters. Itoh et al. (2002) assumed it to be a good
approximation for the Earth albedo. This assumption may be good enough. However, it is technically diﬃcult for the
hrefl model to take into account the Earth atmospheric abundances. Therefore, we did not use the hrefl model in
our analyses, but relied on EWs that are free from spectral deformation.

We ﬁtted the data with a simple combination model consisting of eight Gaussians and a continuum model. The
eight Gaussians include the prominent seven features listed above, and Ar Heα that is required to ﬁt the data between
ﬂuorescent Ar Kα and Ar Kβ. We adopted a broken power-law model for the continuum emission. In this way, we
measured EWs for individual features. The results are summarized in Table 3.

3.2. Converting EWs to Abundances

The EWs were then converted to absolute elemental abundances. To this end, we calculated model EWs as a function
of abundance to compare with our measurements. We adopted (1) a two-temperature (2T ) model with two values
of T and emission measure (EM ), and (2) a multi-temperature model with power-law dependence of the diﬀerential
emission measure (DEM) on the temperature, i.e., EM = constant × T α. Speciﬁcally, we used the vapec and
cevmkl models in XSPEC for the 2T and DEM cases, respectively, where both models give an emission spectrum from
collisionally-ionized diﬀuse gas, using the atomic database version of ATOMDB3.0.3. Ideally, it would be best if we
can constrain the two temperatures or the maximum temperature by our data themselves. This may be possible if we
can perform detailed spectral ﬁtting, taking account of the spectral deformation due to Earth albedo eﬀects. However,
such a sophisticated spectral modeling is beyond the scope of this paper. We thus assumed the temperatures (kT ) of
the 2T model to be 0.5 keV and 1.7 keV, based on previous studies showing a bimodal DEM with peak temperatures
of those values (e.g., Sylwester et al. 2014; Caspi et al. 2014). As for the DEM model, we assumed kTmax to be 2 keV,
because the lines of our interest (lines from He- and H-like ions of Si, S, Ar, and Ca) are formed by thermal plasmas
with a temperature range of 0.2–2 keV. For X-class ﬂares, there may be additional super-hot (kT & 3 keV) components
(e.g., Caspi et al. 2010). This component may contribute to the data to some extent, but not much in the energy
range below 5 keV.

In our case of the 2T (0.5 keV + 1.7 keV) model or the DEM model, the EW depends not only on the elemental
abundance but also on either the normalization ratio between the two components (N2/N1) or the index (α) of the
power-law temperature distribution. Therefore, to convert EWs to absolute abundances, we need to know these
parameters, which are sensitive to, and thus can be measured by intensity ratios between lines from diﬀerent charge
states of the same element. To this end, we chose a Si Lyα / Si Heα intensity ratio, as it is best constrained in our
data. Figure 5 illustrates how the Si Lyα / Si Heα depends on N2/N1 and α. Based on these plots combined with Si
Lyα / Si Heα ratios, we assessed N2/N1 and α values for all the spectra, as in Table 4.

It should be noted that the Si Lyα / Si Heα ratio increases due to the Earth albedo (the eﬀect of spectral hardening).
To take into account this eﬀect, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation. Details on the simulation are described in
appendix 2. Brieﬂy, the input of the simulation is the intrinsic solar X-ray spectrum, i.e., the apec model with a
typical solar ﬂare temperature of kT = 1.5 keV, and the output is an Earth albedo spectrum. The simulation indicated
that the intrinsic Si Lyα / Si Heα are 0.8 times the albedo data, namely observations. We used the corrected Si Lyα
/ Si Heα ratios to infer the values of N2/N1 and α in Table 4.

We computed model EWs as a function of absolute abundances at the best-estimated N2/N1 (2T model) or α

6

(DEM model) for individual spectra from Flare-1a to Flare-4b. In principle, the model EWs can be derived directly
from the emission models, i.e., vapec and cevmkl. However, we “measured” the model EWs by ﬁtting simulated XIS
spectra with the same model as we used to measure EWs. This process is important especially for X-ray CCDs with
moderate spectral resolution that cannot resolve individual lines; the Gaussians in our ﬁtting include not only the
main line(s) but also some other fainter lines that might aﬀect the EW measurements. Therefore, we ﬁrst generated
model spectra convolved with the XIS response function, by using the fakeit command in XSPEC. We then ﬁtted the
simulated XIS spectra with the same combination model as we did in our EW measurements for real data, obtaining
model EWs. Figure 6 exhibits DEM-model–based EWs as a function of absolute abundance for Flares-1a, 1b, and
1c. Using these plots, we converted the EWs to absolute elemental abundances, which are summarized in Table 5.
The uncertainties on the abundances estimated by varying the EWs within their uncertainties. Throughout this
paper, we give the abundances relative to the photospheric values by Lodders et al. (2003); Si/H = 3.47×10−5, S/H
= 1.55×10−5, Ar/H = 3.55×10−6, and Ca/H = 2.19×10−6 in number. These values are in between the classical
abundances by Anders & Grevesse (1989) and a more recent abundances by Asplund et al. (2009); the former gives
Si/H = 3.55×10−5, S/H = 1.62×10−5, Ar/H = 3.63×10−6, and Ca/H = 2.29×10−6, whereas the latter gives Si/H
= 3.24×10−5, S/H = 1.32×10−5, Ar/H = 2.51×10−6, and Ca/H = 2.19×10−6. Figure 7 shows the same absolute
abundances as a function of time after ﬂaring, where ﬂaring times were deﬁned as GOES X-ray rise-up times determined
by eyes.

We conﬁrmed that the Si Heα- and Si Lyα-based Si abundances generally agree with each other. This shows the
robustness of our conversion process from EWs to abundances. Also, the two abundances derived from the 2T and
DEM models are close with each other, showing the stability on the emission model assumed.

4. DISCUSSION

In Figure 8, we plot the absolute abundances as a function of FIP measured at around each ﬂare peak (i.e., Flare-[1-4]a
spectra). The averaged elemental abundances are calculated to be Ca∼2.0, Si∼0.7, S∼0.3, and Ar∼0.9 solar photo-
spheric values. This abundance pattern reminds us of the i-FIP eﬀect with a turnover at the low end of FIP as observed
in coronae of several active stars (Osten et al. 2003; Sanz-Forcada et al. 2003; Argiroﬃ et al. 2004; Huenemoerder et al.
2013). In fact, such i-FIP eﬀects from solar ﬂares are consistent with the picture that high/low-FIP enriched coronae
feature a relative enrichment of low/high-FIP elements during ﬂares (Nordon & Behar 2008). We note that their
suggestion is mainly based on Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of stars, while they did include the Sun as one
of the examples of low-FIP enriched coronae and high-FIP enhanced (relative to low-FIP elements) ﬂares.

In the decay phase of the ﬂares, the Si abundance signiﬁcantly increases up to ∼2 times the initial value, so that the
abundance approaches the coronal abundance. The same trend can be seen for S as well. This abundance evolution
is also seen for ﬂares in other stars; the abundance pattern exhibits the strong i-FIP/FIP eﬀect during ﬂare peaks,
and then evolves toward the preﬂare FIP/i-FIP basal state (e.g., Tsuru et al. 1989; Stern et al. 1992; Pan et al. 1997;
Tsuboi et al. 1998; Favata et al. 2000; Liefke et al. 2010). These properties can be explained by the scenario that the
excess emission of ﬂares is caused by the chromospheric evaporation, as discussed in Nordon & Behar (2008).

A similar Fe (a low-FIP element with FIP = 7.9 eV) abundance increase during solar ﬂares were found by Warren
(2014) who measured absolute abundances for 21 M9.3 to X6.9 class ﬂares using SDO/EVE spectra. On the other
hand, such low-FIP increases were not seen in many other observations of solar ﬂares (e.g., Narendranath et al. 2014;
Dennis et al. 2015; Sylwester et al. 2015). The reason of such ﬂare-to-ﬂare variations is unclear, but one notable
diﬀerence is the ﬂare size; those investigated by this work and (Warren 2014) are generally larger than those by
others. We speculate that the composition of larger ﬂares tends to show a greater departure (or a clearer i-FIP eﬀects)
compared with those in coronae. As a result, they may show signiﬁcant abundance evolution toward preﬂare states in
the decay phase.

It is interesting to compare our results with i-FIP patches recently discovered near sunspots during solar ﬂares (e.g.,
Doschek et al. 2015). First, the composition is diﬀerent between the i-FIP patches and the ﬂares of our interest. The
i-FIP patches exhibit anomalously high Ar XIV / Ca XIV intensity ratios, with an extreme case that the measured
relative Ar/Ca abundance is about 10 (30) times the photospheric (coronal) value. This does not agree with our
measured Ar/Ca ratios of about 3 times the solar photospheric value.
In addition, the absolute abundance of Ca
(Ca/H) appears to diﬀer, as well. At the i-FIP patches, there are two independent arguments that the Ca abundance
is depleted, which makes the relative Ar/Ca abundance very high, as observed (Doschek & Warren 2016; Brooks 2018).
This would disagree with our measurement, i.e., Ca/H ∼ 2 times the photospheric value. These composition diﬀerences
are not surprising, given that our data are spatially unresolved, full disk integration, whereas the i-FIP patches are
highly-localized small regions. Perhaps, the i-FIP patches would not make a signiﬁcant contribution to the total X-ray

7

emission from ﬂares.

The composition diﬀerence between i-FIP patches and our measurements could be explained by diﬀerent turnover
FIPs, by analogy to various turnover FIPs observed in active stars: a turnover above Al (FIP = 6.0 eV), Ca (FIP =
6.1 eV), Na (FIP = 5.1 eV), and K (FIP = 4.3 eV) for σ2 CrB (Osten et al. 2003), AB Dor (Sanz-Forcada et al. 2003),
PZ Tel (Argiroﬃ et al. 2004), and σ Gem (Huenemoerder et al. 2013), respectively. Namely, the i-FIP patches would
have a particularly low turnover FIP below Ca, whereas most of the ﬂaring region (responsible for our observations)
would have a relatively high turnover FIP between Ca and Si (FIP = 8.2 eV). Understanding the origin of such a
turnover and its spatial variation is left as an important future work.

One important question about the i-FIP patches in past observations was which element is enhanced and which ele-
ment is depleted. Based on direct measurements of EWs, combined with emission models of either a two-temperature
model or a multi-temperature model with power-law dependence of the diﬀerential emission measure on the temper-
ature, we revealed that the Si abundance is depleted around ﬂare peaks when the i-FIP eﬀect becomes evident. This
is consistent with the ponderomotive fractionation model proposed by Laming (2004, 2012, 2015, 2017), in which the
ponderomotive force, which can be directed either upward or downward depending on the situation, can act only on
low-FIP elements, so that enhanced and depleted low-FIP elements are expected for FIP and i-FIP eﬀects, respectively,
with high-FIP elements unmodiﬁed. The transition from depletion to enhancement of the Si abundance in the decay
phases of the ﬂares would be caused by plasma mixing with the surrounding FIP biased plasmas, as was proposed to
explain fading i-FIP patches (Baker et al. 2019).

We point out that the absolute abundances vary from ﬂare to ﬂare by a factor of 2 with no correlations with
other physical parameters such as the ﬂare class and temperature. This is consistent with previous results (e.g.,
Sylwester et al. 1998). On the other hand, we argued that i-FIP eﬀects may be present only for giant ﬂares in their
early-phases. Therefore, there might be an anti-correlation between the absolute abundance and the ﬂare class, if we
accumulate a large range of ﬂare classes and focus on the initial phase of ﬂares.

Finally, we note that the X-Ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM: Tashiro et al. 2018), the Japan-US X-ray
astronomy mission scheduled to be launched in early 2022, will dramatically improve abundance studies for solar ﬂares
and corona. XRISM will be in the same low-Earth orbit as Suzaku, allowing for a long-term, 96-minutes cadence
monitoring of the Sun via Earth albedo as a byproduct. Thanks to the superior energy resolution, FWHM.7 eV (or
E/∆E ∼ 600 at 3 keV) with little energy dependence in 0.2–12 keV, of the X-ray micro-calorimeter onboard XRISM,
we will be able to detect much more lines than Suzaku/XIS. These include lines from many elements such as C, N,
O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Fe, and Ni in addition to the four abundant intermediate-mass elements analyzed in this paper.
Therefore, we will be able to obtain detailed abundance patterns from individual ﬂares, as with the cases of the high-
resolution X-ray spectroscopy of stellar coronae with gratings onboard Chandra and XMM-Newton. Furthermore,
ﬂuorescent lines of N, O, Ar from the Earth atmosphere will be clearly detected. These will provide us with intriguing
information about upper atmosphere of the Earth.

5. CONCLUSION

We performed X-ray spectroscopy of four X-class ﬂares, using Earth albedo data obtained with Suzaku/XIS. The
good energy resolution and low background of Suzaku/XIS allow several features and underlying continuum emission
to be clearly detected. We measured EWs of line features from intermediate-mass elements, i.e., Si, S, Ar, and Ca, and
converted them to the absolute abundances (X/H). The absolute elemental abundances averaged over the four ﬂares
are obtained to be ∼2.0 (Ca), ∼0.7 (Si), ∼0.3 (S), and ∼0.9 (Ar) at around ﬂare peaks. This abundance pattern is
consistent with i-FIP eﬀects seen in active stars’ coronae. The depletion of Si (and S) is consistent with the Laming
model to explain both FIP and i-FIP eﬀects observed in stellar coronae. The abundances are almost constant during
the ﬂares, whereas Si increases by a factor of ∼2 in the decay phase. Such Si abundance evolution is consistent with
a picture that the i-FIP plasma originates from the chromosphere evaporation and then mixes with the surrounding
low-FIP biased materials.

A. A NEW METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE DARK LEVEL OF THE XIS

APPENDIX

The telemetry of each event in the Suzaku XIS data analyzed here contains the dark-subtracted pulse-height (PH)
values of 9 pixels, which are the event center pixel and the neighboring 8 pixels. The energy value of each event is
reconstructed from the 9 PH values in the ground processing based on the grade method3. The event telemetry also
contains two kinds of information about the surrounding 16 pixels, pOuterMost and sumOuterMost. pOuterMost is
a 16-bit “hit pattern” identifying which surrounding pixels have PH value grater than the threshold. pOuterMost
sumOuterMost is the summed PH value of all the surrounding pixels that have
is also used for event grading.
PH value less than or equal to the threshold. Note that the value of sumOuterMost would be around zero within
statistical ﬂuctuation if the on-board dark estimation follows the actual CCD pedestal value reasonably well. If not,
sumOuterMost would have signiﬁcant oﬀset from zero either positively or negatively. This situation could happen
in the case that the background level varies more rapidly than the on-board dark estimation could follow. Since the
number of surrounding pixels contributing sumOuterMost can be known from pOuterMost, we can measure the amount
of the deviation of the on-board dark estimation from the actual CCD pedestal value per pixel, correct the PH values
of the 9 central pixels by the amount, and recalculate the energy value of the event based on the corrected PH values.
Figure A1 shows a comparison of the bright Earth data spectra before and after applying the correction described
here. All the line structures become sharper after the correction, indicating the validity of this method. The sharpness is
more evident in the lower energy lines since the ratio of the amount of the correction to the event PH is relatively larger
in the lower energy events. We conﬁrm that this method is eﬃcient only for the bright Earth data; no improvement
can be seen for the standard data in which the satellite is pointing to the astronomical objects or the dark side of the
Earth. This fact indicates that the on-board dark estimation of the Suzaku XIS works well for the standard data and
that the intense optical light ﬂux, which is the major source to change the CCD pedestal value in the bright Earth
data, varies rapidly than the on-board dark estimation.

B. MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF EARTH ALBEDO EFFECTS

The spectral hardening due to the reﬂection by the Earth albedo would expect to increase the Si Lyα / Si Heα
line ratio and this eﬀect should be taken into account when interpreting the data. Since the calculation procedures of
the reﬂected X-ray spectrum by the Earth albedo is complicated due to various scattering processes such as Thom-
son scattering and Compton scattering, a Monte Carlo simulation including the intrinsic solar X-ray spectrum and
a relevant air composition of the Earth is an appropriate approach to estimate an expected scattered X-ray spec-
trum. In this paper, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation based on the GEANT4 toolkit library (version 10.04)
(Apostolakis et al. 2003; Allison et al. 2006, 2013), which is commonly used to perform a full Monte Carlo simulations
including complicated geometries. In this simulation framework, we input photons with the energy spectrum from
collisionally-ionized diﬀuse gas, named as apec, which is calculated by the atomic database with the XSPEC software
package (Arnaud 1996). The atomic database version for the simulation is ATOMDB2.0.2, which is diﬀerent from
that used for the X-ray data analysis in §3.1. We conﬁrmed that the model spectrum in 1–5 keV shows no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between ATOMDB2.0.2 and 3.0.3, and thus we conclude that our simulation using ATOMDB2.0.2 can be
applied for comparison to the data analysis.

We assume a typical solar ﬂare temperature of kT =1.5 keV (see § 3.1) with an abundance of solar photospheric
values. Photons are generated enough far from the Earth like a point source. The generated photon interacts the Earth
atmosphere in the simulation. The Earth’s atmosphere is composed of oxygen and nitrogen atoms and molecules, as
well as argon atoms, which were all included in the simulation. The density proﬁle of each component is taken into
account by implementing the 10 km thickness of sphere-shell-shape geometry up to 300 km altitude. It is known that
the density proﬁle would change slightly depending on the solar activity. We conﬁrmed that our simulation result is
not aﬀected by this eﬀect. Therefore, we apply the density proﬁle obtained during a solar maximum period, August
1st, 2013, which is provided by the publicly available NRLMSISE-00 atmosphere model.4

Since what we have to know is the reﬂected X-ray spectrum by the Earth albedo, we accumulated photons only
scattered by the Earth atmosphere. For this purpose, we put the photon detector at 500 km altitude in the simulation

3 See the Suzaku technical description for the detail, https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/suzaku/prop tools/suzaku td/

and record the photon only with the angle between incident and detected position of larger than π/2. Figure B1 (a)
shows the example of the input and the scattered X-ray spectrum, in which we can see that the hardening of the
continuum as well as some changes of line ratios due to the scattering. The simulated X-ray reﬂection spectrum is
converted to the XSPEC table model, so that we can estimate the line ratio by convolving with the detector response
of the Suzaku XIS as shown in Figure B1 (b). It should be noted that the solar X-ray scattering angles are around
110 deg in our cases (see Table 1). We conﬁrmed, however, that there is no obvious spectral diﬀerence around 2 keV
between reﬂection angles of 90–180 deg and 105–115 deg.

with temperatures of 1.7 keV and 0.5 keV (see text for more details). The scatter of the data points is due to the statistical
ﬂuctuation arising from spectral ﬁts to faked (simulated) XIS spectra. (b) Same as left but for the DEM model. The x-axis, α,

are responsible for Flare-1a, 1b, and 1c, respectively. Similarly to Figure 5, the scatter of the data points is the statistical
ﬂuctuation arising from spectral ﬁts to faked spectra.
