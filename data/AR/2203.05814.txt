The current status of the Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) project at Fermilab is reviewed. While
the installation of SBND is still in progress, ICARUS has taken its ﬁrst neutrino data on beam:
using both the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) and the Neutrino at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam.
MicroBooNE has presently completed its data taking and is producing the world’s ﬁrst high
statistics results on 𝜈-Ar interactions, in both inclusive and exclusive channels. In parallel, the
unexpected MiniBooNE “low energy excess” is under investigation, to search for sterile neutrinos.
The physics potential for sterile neutrino searches at SBN will be outlined, with emphasis on the
Neutrino-4 experiment and the possible ICARUS veriﬁcation of this claim.

Introduction

Anomalies observed in short baseline (SBL) oscillation experiments in the last 20 years (see
table 1), not ﬁtting inside the standard model of 3-ﬂavour neutrino mixing, may be explained by
a 3+1 oscillation model with a sterile neutrino, where Δ𝑚2 ∼ 𝑂 (1𝑒𝑉 2) and sin2(2𝜃) is relatively
small. Unluckily no model has so far been successful in ﬁtting all experimental results at once.

The Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino program (SBN) [5] has been proposed in 2015 to give
a deﬁnitive answer to the problem. The SBN program will have the unique possibility to exploit
both 𝜈𝑒 appearance and 𝜈𝜇 disappearance using the well known Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) 1
and employing three detectors based on the common technology of Liquid Argon (LAr) TPC. As
shown in ﬁgure 1, SBND is located at 100 m from the BNB target, followed by MicroBooNE at 470
m and Icarus at 600 m. BNB is a conventional horn-focussed 𝜈𝜇 beam with an energy spectrum
peaking at ∼ 700 MeV and with a well-known 𝜈𝑒 contamination (∼ 0.5%), see the right panel of
ﬁgure 1. While SBND will collect events from BNB at a rate of 0.25 Hz, Icarus will have a 0.03
Hz rate. Being at ground level, with a limited overburden, both detectors will have a sizeable rate
of cosmics: around 0.03 Hz at SBND and 0.14 Hz at Icarus. The mitigation of this issue is one
fundamental aspect of data taking for both experiments.

2. The SBN Physics Program

The SBN Physics Program was set up:

• to understand the nature of MiniBooNE “low energy excess”, with MicroBooNE (Phase I);

• to search search for sterile neutrinos both in appearance and disappearance channels, using
SBND as near and ICARUS as far detector (Phase II). The use of the same detector technology
will greatly reduce the systematics errors, while the good 𝜈𝑒 identiﬁcation capability of a LAr
TPC will help to reduce backgrounds.

• pave the ground for future long-baseline experiments, as DUNE [8], by a further development
of the LAr TPC technology and by a high-statistics measure of 𝜈−Ar cross sections in the
few GeV region.

SBND will accumulate ∼ 7 × 106 𝜈𝜇 and 5 × 104 𝜈𝑒 events in a 3-year run, to measure 𝜈−Ar cross
sections in the DUNE energy range. ICARUS will collect ∼ 105 events/year from the NuMI beam
(oﬀ-axis) producing high statistics electron neutrino cross sections. Five sigmas sensitivities will
be reached in the SBN program with 3-year data taking (6.6 × 1020 POT), to search for sterile
neutrinos in appearance or disappearance channels, in the currently allowed parameter region. The
expected sensitivities are shown in ﬁgure 2. In addition, a rich program of BSM searches will be

performed, looking for neutrino tridents, dark matter, heavy leptons, Lorentz and CPT violations ...
The reactor Neutrino-4 experiment has recently shown evidence at 2.7 𝜎 for an oscillatory
pattern with best ﬁt parameters Δ𝑚2
𝑁 4 = 7.30 eV2, sin2𝜃 𝑁 4 = 0.36. [9]. Having a similar L/E ratio,
ICARUS alone may provide a complete veriﬁcation of this claim in less than one year, by using
both the BNB and the NuMI beam [10]. About 11500 𝜈𝜇 CC events will be collected in 3 months
of data taking at BNB and about 5200 𝜈𝑒 interactions will be accumulated in 1 year of data taking
at NuMI. Survival 𝜈𝜇 (𝜈𝑒) probability are shown in ﬁgure 3, for the oscillation case. Neutrino-4
expectations are shown as black dotted line or blue continous line in the ﬁgure.

3. Status of the SBN Program

The SBN detectors are based on the LAr TPC technology introduced by C. Rubbia in 1977

[11] and developed by the ICARUS Collaboration in the following years [12].

A LAr TPC is a kind of “electronic bubble chamber” that gives detailed images as shown in
ﬁgure 4. As a ﬁgure of merit in the heavy freon bubble chamber “Gargamelle” the sensitive mass

CERN (left side) and by ICARUS T600 (right side). “Bubble” sizes are similar.

was 3 tons, compared to the 600 tons of ICARUS LAr TPC.

3.1 Phase I: MicroBooNe

MicroBooNE is currently the world’s longest running LAr TPC: from 2015 on. With a mass of
170 tons of liquid Argon (87 tons active volume), it consists of a TPC with 2.5 m drift, a system of 32
8” PMTs coated with TPB and a top/side cosmic ray tagger (CRT) to reject cosmics. It has presently
completed its physics run, with more than 33 published papers. It has produced the world’s ﬁrst
high statistics precision studies of 𝜈-Ar interactions, in both inclusive and exclusive ﬁnal states [13].
In addition, it is investigating the unexpected MiniBooNE excess (> 3𝜎 statistical and systematics
combined) at lower energies of neutrino interactions producing ﬁnal states electrons or photons.
The two possibilities may not be discriminated by a Cherenkov detector as MiniBooNE, in contrast

with MicroBooNE that uses a diﬀerent technology and thus has the possibility to assess if these
events are due to 𝜈𝑒 charged current interactions, see reference [14] for more details. Unfortunately,
due to its surface location, MicroBooNE has very limited capabilities in non-accelerator 𝜈 physics.

3.2 Phase II: SBND+Icarus

Phase II of the SBN program will use both SBND as near detector and ICARUS as far detector
to study SBL neutrino oscillations. With a mass of 260 tons of LAr (112 tons active mass) SBND is
made of 2 TPCs with 2m drift, a light detection system based on 120 8" PMTs (96 coated with TPB)
and 192 X-ARAPUCA photon traps instrumented with SiPMs and a 4𝜋 CRT. One central cathode
plane assembly (CPA) divides the TPC active volume ( 5 × 5 × 4𝑚3) in two drift volumes. The
readout is based on two anode planes assemblies (APA), made of 3 wire planes each (vertical, ±60◦)
with a wire pitch ∼ 3 mm, see ﬁgure 5 for details. Behind APAs, 24 photon detection modules

Figure 5: Left panel: layout of the SBND TPCs (top), layout of one PDS module (bottom). Rght panel:
cathode plane assembly (CPA) recently installed (top); ﬁrst APA plane on-site (bottom)

(PDS) are placed. Each is made of 5 PMTs and 8 X-ARAPUCA modules. Every side of the
detector will be covered by planes of extruded scintillator strips, making the CRT. In regards to the
installation at Fermilab, PMTs and X-ARAPUCAs have been tested and delivered, TPC installation
is under way as well as CRT and cryostat/cryogenics and will be ﬁnished by 2022.

ICARUS has an active mass of 476 tons of liquid Argon. It was refurbished at CERN in the
framework of the WA104 program [15]. Cold vessels and a purely passive insulation were installed;
a new scintillation light detection system (based on 360 PMTs coated with TPB) was provided; a
new TPC readout electronics was implemented and cryogenics and LAr puriﬁcation systems were
refurbished. The present installation status of the ICARUS cryogenic system at Fermilab, on the
top of the detector, is shown in ﬁgure 6. Aside the top CRT, installation activities in ICARUS are
completed, with latest adjustments during COVID-19 restricted operations. Since March 17th 2020

the detector is operated with 24/7 remote shifts and a minimal presence in situ. One of the main
problems in ICARUS data-taking is its installation at shallow depth, with a limited overburden.
ICARUS will thus be exposed to a continuos ﬂux of cosmic rays, containing high-energy muons
that may be misidentiﬁed as part of a neutrino interaction. To mitigate this problem, two handles
are available: a 4𝜋 CRT surrounding ICARUS TPCs and the timing in coincidence with the beam
spill, from the PMTs system. The 3m overburden, on the top of ICARUS, will absorb more than
99% of the incoming photons and hadrons. The CRT system is composed of a bottom, a side
and a top CRT. Each is made of two layers of plastic scintillators, partly recuperated from Double
CHOOZ and MINOS. The CRT will provide informations on incoming muons by their detection
and measurement of crossing time and coordinates. Preliminary results are shown in reference [17].
The new light detection system [18] is based on 360 8" R5912-MOD photomultipliers, installed
behind the TPCs wires, as shown in ﬁgure 6. The PMTs’ coating with TPB allows the detection
of the prompt scintillation light from LAr at 128 nm. The system will allow ICARUS to identify
the time of occurrence (𝑡0) of any ionizing event in the TPC with ∼ 1 ns timing resolution, localize
events with ≤ 50 cm spatial resolution and determine their rough topology and generate a trigger
signal for readout. Together with the beam bunched structure, this will allow an eﬃcient rejection of
the cosmics background. PMTs’ equalization of gain and timing is performed with a laser system,
ﬂashed on each PMT by a dedicated ﬁber system [19].

The other major issue in ICARUS data taking is the Argon purity level, that aﬀects the electron
drift lefeime 𝜏𝐷. As shown in ﬁgure 7 in RUN0 𝜏𝐷 reached up to ∼ 4.5(3) ns in the EAST
(WEST) cryostat, allowing eﬃcient signal detection over the full LAr volume. This was due
to improvements on poor performing GAr recirculation units and periodic venting (3 times/day).
Further improvements are expected from the installation of new higher capacity GAr ﬁlters.

ICARUS RUN0 with BNB and NuMI beamlines

During RUN0, up to end of July 2021, ICARUS has taken data with the following goals:

• certify the readiness of the detector for physics quality data, operating as primary BNB user;

• verify the possibility to run the detector in remote mode 24/7, with a limited on-site presence;

Figure 7: Left panel: measured electron drift lifetime during ICARUS RUN0. Right panel: delivered and
collected data during RUN0 from the ICARUS detector.

• test DAQ for diﬀerent triggers for both BNB and NuMI beam;

• accumulate data samples of good quality to tune neutrino and cosmics event reconstruction.

Two main triggers we used to collect BNB and NuMI events: a Minimum Bias Trigger, where
data were recorded for every beam spill and a “Majority trigger” using pairs of discriminated PMT
signals in coincidence with the beam spill gate. As shown in ﬁgure 7 about 27.8 × 1018(52.0 × 1018
POT were collected from BNB (NuMI) beams with an eﬃciency ∼ 95%. As examples of the
commissioning of ICARUS in RUN0, ﬁgure 8 shows the results of the PMTS’ gain equalization
using the laser system and single photoelectrons from the background 2 and of the measurement of
space charge eﬀects (SCE) using anode-cathode-crossing cosmic muons, looking at distortions in
the drift direction.

ment of SCE for the ICARUS TPC.

The ICARUS detector recorded its ﬁrst muon and electron neutrinos, thus demonstrating its
excellent detection capabilities. About 254 𝜈𝜇 CC and 15 𝜈𝑒 CC candidates were selected and
visually scanned during this run. Examples of charge current (CC) quasi-elastic (QE) candidates
from BNB and NuMI beams are shown in ﬁgure 9. The top panels of ﬁgure 9 show a picture of

clearly visible.

5. Conclusions

The SBN program at Fermilab is progressing well, with MicroBOONE now producing high
statistics measurements of 𝜈−Ar cross sections and getting closer to release the ﬁrst results on the
low energy excess of MiniBooNE, with 6 × 1020 POT.

ICARUS was activated in August 2020 and is currently taking data.
Assembly and installation of SBND detector are progressing and will ﬁnish by 2022.
