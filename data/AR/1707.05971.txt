Abstract
Seven-year long seeing-free observations of solar magnetic ﬁelds with the Helio-
seismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) were used to study the sources of the solar mean magnetic ﬁeld, SMMF,
deﬁned as the net line-of-sight magnetic ﬂux divided over the solar disk area.
To evaluate the contribution of diﬀerent regions to the SMMF, we separated
all the pixels of each SDO/HMI magnetogram into three subsets: weak (BW),
intermediate (BI), and strong (BS) ﬁelds. The BW component represents areas
with magnetic ﬂux densities below the chosen threshold; the BI component is
mainly represented by network ﬁelds, remains of decayed active regions (ARs),
and ephemeral regions. The BS component consists of magnetic elements in ARs.
To derive the contribution of a subset to the total SMMF, the linear regression
coeﬃcients between the corresponding component and the SMMF were calcu-
lated. We found that: i) when the threshold level of 30 Mx cm-2 is applied, the BI
and BS components together contribute from 65% to 95% of the SMMF, while
the fraction of the occupied area varies in a range of 2–6% of the disk area; ii) as
the threshold magnitude is lowered to 6 Mx cm-2, the contribution from BI+BS
grows to 98%, and the fraction of the occupied area reaches the value of about
40% of the solar disk. In summary, we found that regardless of the threshold
level, only a small part of the solar disk area contributes to the SMMF. This
means that the photospheric magnetic structure is an intermittent, inherently
porous medium, resembling a percolation cluster. These ﬁndings suggest that the

long-standing concept that continuous vast unipolar areas on the solar surface
are the source of the SMMF may need to be reconsidered.

1. Introduction

The solar mean magnetic ﬁeld (SMMF) is deﬁned as a mean line-of-sight (LOS)
magnetic ﬁeld calculated over the entire visible solar disk (Scherrer et al., 1977;
Garc´ıa et al., 1999). Since most of the magnetic regions on the Sun are bipolar
the SMMF has very low amplitude ranging from about 0.15 G during solar
activity minimum to 1 G during maximum (Livingston et al., 1991; Garc´ıa et
al., 1999). Thus, the magnitude of the SMMF represents the imbalance of the
LOS magnetic ﬂux density calculated over the entire solar disk.

The SMMF is closely related to the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF, Sev-
erny et al. (1970); Scherrer et al. (1977). The SMMF structure and polarity are
reproduced by in situ observations of the IMF near the Earth ﬁve to seven days
later (Bremer, 1996).

A commonly accepted point of view is that the SMMF magnitude is deﬁned
by vast areas on the solar surface that exhibit weak, large-scale magnetic ﬁelds
(Severny, 1971; Scherrer et al., 1977; Kotov, Stepanian, and Shcherbakova, 1977;
Haneychuk, Kotov, and Tsap, 2003; Xiang and Qu, 2016).

On the other hand, there are observational indications suggesting that the
SMMF is related, at least partly, to the presence of active regions (ARs) on the
solar disk. Kotov, Stepanian, and Shcherbakova (1977) analyzed contribution
of the background and AR magnetic ﬁelds to the SMMF, and concluded that
while the SMMF is predominantly deﬁned by vast regions of weak ﬁeld, ARs can
signiﬁcantly contribute to the SMMF during certain time intervals. Demidov
(2011) also reported that the inﬂuence of ARs on the SMMF can be rather
essential. Numerical simulations of the SMMF (Sheeley, DeVore, and Boris,
1985), that took into account only ARs on the solar disk as a source of magnetic
ﬂux, showed a good correlation with the observed SMMF. Indirect evidence of
the relationship between the SMMF and ARs can also be inferred from sunspots
statistics measured on time scales of a solar cycle (e.g. Xiang and Qu, 2016):
a long-period (years) component of the SMMF varies almost in phase with the
total area of sunspots. Both the SMMF and the total area of ARs reveal nearly
27 day variations caused by solar diﬀerential rotation (e.g. Boberg et al., 2002;
Haneychuk, Kotov, and Tsap, 2003).

The current state of the research topic and the availability of high quality full
disk magnetic ﬁeld data motivated us to further explore the role of ARs in the
SMMF formation.

During the last couple of decades an impressive progress in solar instru-
mentation was made, which substantially advanced our understanding of solar
magnetism in general and quiet-Sun magnetic ﬁelds in particular. Thus, analysis
of Hinode/SOT magnetograph data demonstrated the ubiquitous presence of

mixed polarity magnetic concentrations along with unipolar isolated magnetic
elements distributed all over the solar disk (Ishikawa and Tsuneta, 2010, 2011;
Lites et al., 2008), and separated by vast zones of noise (see Figure 1 in Ishikawa
and Tsuneta (2011)). The 1.6 m New Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar
Observatory (NST/BBSO) allowed us to estimate the minimal observed size of
magnetic ﬂux tubes, which turned out to be less than the diﬀraction limit (77
km) of the NST (Abramenko et al., 2010). The magnetic ﬁeld structure in areas
outside ARs was found to possess multifractal properties (Abramenko, 2013).
All this encourages us to reexamine the long-standing paradigm that vast areas
of weak magnetic ﬁelds outside ARs are essential contributors to the observed
SMMF.

Recently, we showed (Kutsenko and Abramenko, 2016) that the SMMF can be
calculated as an average of the magnetic ﬂux density from LOS magnetograms
provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Schou et al., 2012) on
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Scherrer et al. (2012); Liu et al.
(2012)). In the present article, we intend to determine the contribution to the
SMMF made by diﬀerent magnetic areas. We separated all pixels of SDO/HMI
magnetograms into three subsets: i) noise and/or quiet-Sun pixels (the weakest
magnetic areas), ii) AR areas (strongest magnetic areas), and iii) intermediate
areas (predominantly remains of ARs, ephemeral regions, network ﬁelds). To
evaluate their contributions, we determined a fraction of the magnetic ﬂux from
each subset in the total SMMF. The total area occupied by each subset was also
scrutinized. The seven-year time interval starting April, 2010 was analyzed.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

2.1. The SDO/HMI Data Set

Recently Kutsenko and Abramenko (2016) showed that SDO/HMI magnetograms
can be successfully used to calculate the SMMF by averaging the magnetic
ﬂux density in a full-disk magnetogram. A comparison to the patrol SMMF
measurements performed at the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO, Scherrer et
al. (1977)) showed that the conversion factor between the SDO/HMI and WSO
SMMFs is very close to unity (BHMI = (0.99±0.02)BWSO) and the correlation
coeﬃcient equals 0.86. In the present study, we used one LOS magnetogram per
day from the hmi.M 720s series covering a seven-year interval from April 2010
to November 2016.

The instrument produces a 4096×4096 pixel image with a pixel size 0.5”
and a spatial resolution of 1” (Scherrer et al., 2012; Schou et al., 2012; Liu
et al., 2012). A typical distribution function of the magnetic ﬂux density in a
hmi.M 720s magnetogram is shown in Figure 1. Following Hagenaar (2001) and
Liu et al. (2012), we approximated the core of the distribution function of each
magnetogram by a Gaussian ﬁt F (B) = F MAXexp(−(B−oﬀset)2/2σ2)

The noise level of magnetograms varies slightly around a mean value σ=5.9
Mx cm-2 that is consistent with the result by Liu et al. (2012) who obtained

Figure 1. A typical distribution function for the magnetic ﬂux density in a SDO/HMI mag-
netogram (black dots). A Gaussian ﬁt to the core of the distribution is shown in red. The
standard deviation of the Gaussian is 5.97 Mx cm-2, while the oﬀset of the ﬁt curve is -0.27
Mx cm-2

σ=6.3 Mx cm-2. The noise level is determined by the instrumental noise as well
as by the quiet-Sun ﬁelds.

Following Hagenaar (2001), we accepted 5σ=30 Mx cm-2 as the threshold
value for discriminating between true solar magnetic elements and the artiﬁcial
increase of magnetic ﬂux density that might be caused by instrumental noise.
Interestingly, the Gaussian ﬁts to the distribution function of ﬂux densities are
typically shifted toward negative values by approximately 0.20 Mx cm-2. This
diﬀers from Liu et al. (2012), who reported a positive oﬀset of 0.07 Mx cm-2.

2.2. Detection of Magnetic Flux Concentrations

A mask was built for each magnetogram to detect magnetic ﬂux concentrations
(MFCs). We consider a MFC as a group of touching pixels that comprises a
connected magnetic region in the photosphere. The mask was created by thresh-
olding a magnetogram with the value of 5σ. If the absolute magnetic ﬂux density
in a pixel exceeds the threshold, the correspondent pixel in the mask is set to
unity. At the next step of the analysis a region-growing technique similar to that
used by Benkhalil et al. (2006) was applied. A unity pixel nearest to the ﬁrst
element of the mask is selected as a “seed” pixel. The seed pixel is treated as
the initial element of an MFC: pixels of the expected MFC will be clustered
around it. This seed pixel is labeled uniquely and the four neighboring four
pixels (located to the left, right, bottom, and top) are scanned. If any of the four
pixels is also unity the pixel coordinates are stored and it is labeled as the initial
seed pixel and the procedure is repeated. In case there are no new pixels the
algorithm considers the cluster formation complete and proceeds to search for a
next unity pixel. We analyzed only those MFCs with an area of three or more
squared pixels and located within a circle of size 0.95 of the solar radius. As a
result we obtained a map of MFCs on the photosphere. Each isolated MFC has

Figure 2. SDO/HMI full-disk 720s magnetogram on 13 December, 2014 (left panel) and the
corresponding mask (right panel). The MFCs, which are attributed to ARs, are shown in white
while other MFCs are shown in black. Quiet-Sun areas are shown in gray. The magnetogram

a unique label and all its pixel coordinates are stored. The total ﬂux of an MFC
was then calculated as the sum of absolute values of the magnetic ﬂux density
in pixels multiplied by a pixel area. Note that groups of weak-ﬁeld pixels (below
the threshold) completely surrounded by MFCs remain uncaptured by these
surrounding MFCs and, consequently, their magnetic ﬂux does not contribute
to the total magnetic ﬂux of these MFCs. An example of such weak-ﬁeld groups
of pixels is shown in Figure 2, right panel.

We ﬁrst detected strong-ﬂux MFCs, i.e. those that belong to active regions
(ARs). To identify an AR-type MFC, we used the deﬁnition by Hagenaar, Schri-
jver, and Title (2003): a MFC is attributed to the AR-type if its total unsigned
ﬂux exceeds 3×1020 Mx. Note that an AR-type MFC may occupy an extended
area and include mixed polarity magnetic ﬁelds. An example of the mask is shown
in Figure 2, where the AR-type MFCs are shown in white. The contribution from
all AR-type MFCs into the SMMF will be denoted as the BS component.

The rest of the detected MFCs we considered as intermediate-type MFCs
(Figure 2, black). Their contribution into the SMMF is denoted as the BI
component.

Finally, all pixels with the absolute ﬂux density below the 5σ=30 Mx cm-2
threshold represent the weakest ﬁeld areas and their contribution to the SMMF
is denoted here as the BW component.

Note that, with certain exceptions, the pixels once attributed to intermediate-
or strong-ﬂux regions (at the stage of mask building where the pixel separation
by threshold is performed) cannot be reidentiﬁed as a weak-ﬁeld pixels (at the
stage of MFC ﬂux calculation where MFCs are only identiﬁed as intermediate-
or strong-ﬂux regions) and vice versa. The exceptions are pixels that compose a
MFC of an area of one or two pixels as mentioned above although their inﬂuence
is negligible. Note also that the noise may cause fragmentation of a MFC that
belongs to a real single magnetic region. In this case the algorithm may fail to

correctly identify the type of a region, nevertheless it aﬀects only the BI and BS
components.

To estimate the contribution of each of the three types separately, we calcu-
lated the total signed magnetic ﬂux over each of the AR-type and intermediate
MFCs, and all weakest/noise pixels. The obtained ﬂuxes were normalized by
the total area of the solar disk so that the obtained values mimic the SMMF
that would have been produced by a given MFC assuming that there are no
other sources of magnetic ﬂux on the disk. Naturally, the sum of these MFC
ﬂuxes gives the total SMMF. Note that the SMMF components are measured
in Mx cm-2 since they are obtained by dividing magnetic ﬂux by the solar disk
area.

A comparison of magnetograms and the corresponding masks (see Figure 2)
allows us to infer what kind of MFCs are associated with the intermediate-
ﬂux component. On one hand, analysis of the mask pattern shows that the
intermediate-ﬂux MFCs form hexagonal patterns and, consequently, they are
predominantly represented by network ﬁelds along the boundaries of supergran-
ules. On the other hand, the weakest detected MFC consists of three pixels of
30 Mx cm-2 and yields approximately 1017 Mx of magnetic ﬂux. Hence we can
conclude that the intermediate-ﬂux component BI is formed as a combination of:
i) network magnetic elements with ﬂuxes of 1017-1019 Mx, ii) ephemeral regions
with magnetic ﬂux of 1018-3×1020 Mx (Karak and Brandenburg, 2016), and iii)
remains of decayed ARs (Hagenaar, Schrijver, and Title, 2003).

3. Results

Following the above approach we calculated the three components of the SMMF
and the total SMMF from each of the 2392 magnetograms in the seven-year
long dataset. A sample of their time variations is shown in Figure 3. The
weak, intermediate, and AR-ﬂux components are plotted in blue, green, and
red colors, respectively. The total SMMF is shown in black. The plot covers a
one-year interval from April 2014 to March 2015. One can see that the weak-ﬂux
component, BW, slightly undulates around the zero level, while the intermediate,
BI, and the strong-ﬂux, BS, components exhibit relatively intense, often similar
in amplitude variations. Also there are intervals where the total SMMF is de-
termined predominantly by the strong-ﬂux component as, for example, during
June-August 2014.

To estimate the contribution of a given component to the total SMMF during
the entire period under study, we calculated linear regression coeﬃcients between
the component and the total SMMF (Figure 4), which shows that the BW compo-
nent contributes on average only 17% to the total SMMF, while the sum BI+BS
contributes the remaining 83%. The Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient between
BI+BS and the total SMMF equals 0.98 whereas the dependence between the
SMMF and BW is weaker: the Pearson’s R in this case equals 0.69. Note that
BI and BS separately contribute 49% and 34%, respectively.

We also examined temporal variations of the contributions with a solar cycle.
We chose a 150-day-long window initially centered on July, 15, 2010. The SMMF

and its three component values related to this temporal interval were extracted
from the data series and linear regression coeﬃcients between the total SMMF
and the BW, BI, and BS components were calculated. Then the window center
was shifted one day forward and the procedure repeated until the window center
reached 01 September, 2016. The results are the temporal variation plots with
2241 data points shown in the top panel of Figure 5. The window width was
selected to cover at least several solar rotations to suppress 27-day variations.
On the other hand, too long window might cause loss of information on relatively
fast temporal variations.

Figure 5. Top – The peak-to-peak amplitude of the observed SMMF (thick black curve, see
text). Blue, green, and red colored horizontal ribbons under the black curve represent the
values of BW, BI, and BS components, respectively. The variation of a fraction of a certain
component in the total SMMF is proportional to the width (in the vertical direction) of the
corresponding ribbon. Bottom – The variation of the total area of the sum BI+BS in terms
of percentage of the disk area (black), total area of the intermediate-ﬂux MFCs, BI (green),
and the total area of the strong-ﬂux MFCs, BS (red). All the area curves are averaged over
the 27-day interval.

The thick black curve in Figure 5 shows the peak-to-peak amplitude of the
SMMF. To calculate the peak-to-peak amplitude we applied a procedure sug-
gested by Sheeley and Wang (2015). For each point on the plot, we chose a
28-day interval coaligned with the center of the 150-day-long window described
above. The amplitude was calculated as an absolute diﬀerence of the maximum
value of the SMMF minus the minimum value of the SMMF in the interval. The
center of the interval was shifted synchronously with the 150-day-long window
center. At a ﬁnal step, the curve was smoothed by a 28-day-long sliding average.
The procedure performs demodulation of the SMMF amplitude caused by the
solar rotation.

The blue, green, and red colored horizontal ribbons under the black curve in
Figure 5 represent the values of the BW, BI, and BS components, respectively.
The contribution of each component is proportional to the width (in the vertical
direction) of the corresponding colored ribbon. One can see, for example, that
in 2016 the strong-ﬂux component (the red ribbon in Figure 5, top panel), BS,
is a rather weak contributor.

Contribution to the SMMF from Diﬀerent Solar Regions

Figure 5 (top panel) shows an interesting tendency in the BW behavior. In
2010, which is the year that followed the minimum of solar activity, due to
relatively low BI and BS values, the weak-ﬂux component, BW, contributes up
to one third to the SMMF. A tendency of a gradual growth of the fraction of
BW is observed after December, 2014, i.e. during the declining phase of solar
cycle 24.

In general, during the seven-year observational interval, the sum BI+BS
(black curve in the top panel of Figure 5) constituted between 65% to 95%
of the SMMF.

The highest values of the SMMF during cycle 24 were observed in November-
December 2014 (Figure 3) reaching a magnitude of up to 3 G (Kutsenko and
Abramenko, 2016). Sheeley and Wang (2015) thoroughly analyzed consequent
Carrington maps of HMI photospheric ﬁeld during CR2155-2160 to reveal the
reasons for this increase. They concluded that the increase was caused by “the
systematic emergence of ﬂux in active regions whose longitudinal distribution
greatly increased the Sun’s dipole moment”. We also made a brief analysis of this
event. The active region NOAA 12192, the largest naked-eye sunspot group since
1990 (Sheeley and Wang, 2015), culminated on October 23, 2014 and started to
decay (CR2156). In addition, during the next rotation (CR2157) a new active
region emerged among the dispersed following part of the former AR12192 (see
Figure 2 in Sheeley and Wang, 2015) that probably led to cancellation and a
decrease of some portion of the following part of negative-polarity magnetic ﬂux.
Due to the separation of the following and leading parts, on 13 December, 2014
(CR2158), the positive-polarity remains of AR12192 dominated the east-south
quarter of the visible solar disk (Figure 2, left panel). The mask of the HMI
magnetogram (Figure 2, right panel) indicates that this dispersed region was
identiﬁed by our algorithm as a strong-ﬂux MFC instead of an intermediate-ﬂux
one. This mistaken identiﬁcation can be explained by the large area occupied
by the MFC: the algorithm computes total magnetic ﬂux over the entire MFC
area rather than averaged over the MFC magnetic ﬂux density. Although the
hexagonal patterns imply that the region is practically decayed, the ﬁeld strength
in its pixels reaches values up to 700 Mx cm-2. Thus, the positive uncompensated
magnetic ﬂux of this region produced a rise in the SMMF. Sheeley and Wang
(2015) remarked that this event is not unique: such an increase of the SMMF was
observed during previous cycles and it usually marks the onset of the declining
phase of the cycle.

Time variations of the area fraction corresponding to the BI and BS com-
ponents are shown in Figure 5, bottom panel. The fraction of the total area of
the MFCs that form intermediate- and strong-ﬂux components, p(BI+BS), is
shown in the same panel in black, and it does not exceed 6%. Note that there is
not a perfect agreement between the area and the fraction of a given component
(Figure 5, top panel). The area of the BI component smoothly increases during
the rising phase of the cycle and smoothly decreases during the declining phase.
At the same time the absolute value of BI ﬂuctuates signiﬁcantly during the
same interval. Both the BI and the BS components exhibit variations that are
not in phase with the variations of the corresponding areas (see Section 5 for

discussion on the relationship between the area and the net magnetic ﬂux of
MFCs).

To reveal what kind of MFCs contribute the most to the BI component,
we binned the absolute value of the ﬂux of the intermediate-ﬂux MFCs and
calculated the contributions from each bin (see Figure 6, gray bars). For each
bin, we then determined the linear regression coeﬃcients (Figure 6) which show
that when considering only the intermediate-ﬂux MFCs, maximal contribution
to the SMMF comes from the MFCs with magnetic ﬂux of 1-30×1019 Mx and
they are predominantly associated with vast remains of decaying ARs. Note
that a smooth maximum of the area distribution of the intermediate-ﬂux MFCs
(circles in Figure 6) does not coincide with the maximum of the fraction, being
shifted toward the smaller ﬂuxes.

4. Possible Inﬂuence of the Choice of Threshold

The above analysis was performed with the threshold of 30 Mx cm-2. In order
to understand how the choice of the threshold aﬀects the result we repeated the
calculations for a set of thresholds ranging from 4 to 50 Mx cm-2 with a sampling
of 2 Mx cm-2. The fraction of the total area of the sum BI+BS averaged over
the seven-year interval, as well as their joint contribution to the SMMF, are
plotted versus the threshold in Figure 7. Changing the threshold from, say, 50 to
12 Mx cm-2 (twice the noise level) results in a change in the total area from 4%

to 16%. The total BI+BS area is still small compared to the area of weak-ﬂux
pixels and the joint contribution of BI+BS (0.75 at the 50 Mx cm-2 threshold
and 0.93 at the 12 Mx cm-2 threshold) still dominates in the SMMF. Further
decrease of the threshold results in a rapid increase of all parameters by up to
41% and 0.98 at the noise level 6 Mx cm-2. The experiment demonstrates that
only a small portion of the solar disk area determines the SMMF value and the
choice of the threshold does not critically aﬀect the results.

Strictly speaking, a MFC can transit from the AR-type subset to the intermediate-

ﬂux subset and vice versa due to decay, fragmentation, emergence of new ﬂux,
etc., as an AR passes across the solar disk. This may lead to rapid decrease
of BS and increase of BI. Also a MFC which belongs to a fragmented part of
an AR can be identiﬁed as an intermediate-ﬂux MFC. All this might aﬀect the
time proﬁles of the components. The damage can be estimated, in particular, by
lowering the threshold of 3×1020 Mx determining the AR-type MFCs. Thus we
checked all the intermediate-ﬂux MFCs with magnetic ﬂux greater than 1×1020
Mx (three times less than the AR threshold). If there was an AR-type MFC in
the vicinity of the intermediate-ﬂux MFC (approximately at a distance of a single
supergranule, 30 Mm) then this intermediate-ﬂux MFC was identiﬁed as an AR-
type MFC belonging to the closest AR. This procedure added dispersed isolated
AR‘ remains to the AR-type MFCs. As a result the averaged contribution of the
ARs to the SMMF increased from 34% to 43%, while the contribution of the
BI component decreased from 48% to 41%. The changes are noticeable but not

signiﬁcant. This implies that both these sources contribute almost equally to the
SMMF regardless of the identiﬁcation technique.

5. Conclusions and Discussion

An opportunity for seven-year long uninterrupted seeing-free observations of the
solar magnetic ﬁelds with the SDO/HMI instrument was used here to study the
sources of the solar mean magnetic ﬁeld, SMMF, deﬁned as the net line-of-sight
magnetic ﬂux divided by the solar disk area.

To evaluate the contribution of diﬀerent magnetic regions on the solar disk
to the SMMF, we separated all the pixels of each SDO/HMI magnetogram into
three subsets. Each subset predominantly includes a certain magnetic-activity
region at the photosphere comprising weak (BW), intermediate (BI), or strong
(BS) ﬁelds. The BW component represents areas with magnetic ﬂux densities
below the chosen threshold; the BI component is represented mainly by network
ﬁelds, remains of decayed ARs, and ephemeral regions. The last component, BS,
consists of magnetic elements in ARs. To measure the contribution of a certain
MFC subset to the total SMMF, the linear regression coeﬃcients between the
corresponding component and the SMMF were calculated.

We found the following:
i) With the threshold level of 30 Mx cm-2 (ﬁve standard deviations of the HMI
noise level), the intermediate- and strong-ﬂux components, BI and BS, together
contribute from 65% to 95% of the SMMF. At the same time, the fraction of the
area, p(BI+BS), varies in the range of 2-6% of the disk area.

ii) As the threshold magnitude is lowered to one standard deviation of the
HMI noise level, 6 Mx cm-2, the contribution from the BI+BS component grows
to 98%, and the fraction of the area, p(BI+BS), reaches the value of about 40%
of the solar disk.

iii) The intermediate-ﬂux component, BI, and the strong-ﬂux component,
BS, contribute almost equally into the SMMF regardless of the identiﬁcation
procedure details.

According to the pioneering studies of the SMMF (Severny, 1971; Scherrer et
al., 1977; Kotov, Stepanian, and Shcherbakova, 1977), the SMMF was thought to
be predominantly determined by vast areas of quiet-Sun regions covering more
than 80% of the solar surface. Such an overestimation of the quiet-Sun areas can
be explained by shortcomings of the data available at that time, in particular,
by the low spatial resolution of full-disk magnetograms. Indeed, Severny (1971)
pointed out that “resolution plays a most important role, because the eﬀect
of averaging at low resolution seriously distorts the pattern obtained with the
magnetograph and can produce ﬁctitious large-scale unipolar regions”. Thus,
strong magnetic ﬁelds of relatively compact and isolated regions of AR remains
become “smeared” over the integration area determined by the spatial resolution
of the instrument. Since decayed ARs exhibit neither sunspots nor pores in
continuum so there are no means to separate whether the magnetic ﬁeld element
originated in a small strong-ﬂux region or a vast region of weak ﬁelds.

Contribution to the SMMF from Diﬀerent Solar Regions

As we showed above, MFCs of magnetic ﬂux of 100-3000×1017 Mx make
the largest contribution to the intermediate-ﬁeld component, BI. Meanwhile the
peak of the total area distribution of the intermediate-ﬂux subsets is shifted
towards lower magnetic ﬂuxes. Mu˜noz-Jaramillo et al. (2015) argued that, at
least down to ﬂuxes of 1019 Mx, the magnetic ﬂux of a magnetic element is
proportional to its area. We may then assume that, as a rough approximation,
the same dependence extends to our lower limit of 1017 Mx. In this case, the
MFCs with magnetic ﬂux of 10-1000×1017 Mx posses the majority of the total
unsigned magnetic ﬂux among the intermediate-ﬂux MFC subset, although they
do not provide the largest contribution to the net ﬂux. Hagenaar, Schrijver,
and Title (2003) concluded that the distribution of such small magnetic regions
can be accurately approximated by a sum of two exponential functions. The low-
ﬂux end of the ﬂux distribution represents small ephemeral regions of ﬂux <1019;
their emergence is almost independent on the cycle phase and these ephemeral
regions emerge mostly as a small bipoles. Consequently, we can assume that their
ﬂux imbalance is small, i.e. they do not contribute much to the SMMF. A slight
increase of the emergence rate of these ephemeral regions is observed during
cycle minimum (Hagenaar, Schrijver, and Title, 2003; Karak and Brandenburg,
2016) that conﬁrms once again their rather weak inﬂuence on the SMMF: the
SMMF exhibits in-phase variation with the solar cycle (e.g. Xiang and Qu,
2016). The high-ﬂux (>1019 Mx) part of the distribution obtained by Hagenaar,
Schrijver, and Title (2003) is “dominated by unipolar areas, in which the cycle
modulation of the active regions that feed these areas is clearly reﬂected...”.
Thus, the intermediate-ﬂux MFCs in our study that contribute the most to the
SMMF are represented by unipolar remains of decayed ARs, which supports our
conclusion based on the analysis of the map of these MFCs.

The surprisingly high contribution of ARs to the SMMF may explain the
rapid variations of the SMMF (minutes to hours) that are not related to solar
rotation (e.g. Demidov, 1995, 2011). Indeed, during certain intervals, when the
contribution of ARs to the SMMF is high, short-period oscillations in the SMMF
can be caused by magnetic ﬂux changes inside ARs. Anyway, this topic requires
further investigation.

The weak-ﬁeld component contribution to the SMMF decreases from 16%
to 2% as the detection threshold is lowered from 30 to 6 Mx cm-2. This low
contribution into the total net ﬂux can be explained by the predominantly closed
nature of weak intranetwork “salt-and-pepper” magnetic features, see, e.g., the
high-resolution observations ﬁndings (Lites et al., 2008; Ishikawa and Tsuneta,
2010; Abramenko, 2013). At the same time, we show here that the weak-ﬂux
component, calculated with the threshold of 30 Mx cm-2, exhibits 27-day varia-
tions (see Figure 3) in phase with that of the strong-ﬂux component. This implies
that both variations might be caused by the same physical mechanisms, namely
the high concentrations of magnetic ﬂux at “active longitudes” (see, e.g., van
Driel-Gesztelyi and Green, 2015). We assume that this happens due to fragments
of ARs less than 1017 Mx. Recall that it takes more than a year for magnetic
ﬂux injected near the equator to migrate to a pole (Sheeley and DeVore, 1986).
So the small unipolar remains can stay at near the same place for many solar
rotations.

Regardless of the threshold level, only a small part of the solar disk area is
covered by magnetic ﬂux with density above the threshold value. This means
that the photospheric magnetic structure is an inherently porous medium, re-
sembling a percolation cluster. In other words, one can say that vast areas of
low activity are intermittent with rather small zones of high activity – a classical
deﬁnition of an intermittent structure with fractal properties (e.g. Frisch, 1995).
The multifractal behavior of various local patterns on the Sun (ARs, zones
in the undisturbed photosphere, etc.) are well demonstrated in the literature
(e.g. Lawrence, Ruzmaikin, and Cadavid, 1993; Abramenko, Yurchyshyn, and
Wang, 2008; McAteer et al., 2016, and references therein). The property of
multifractality of the entire solar disk has not been well explored so far.

As for the revealed signature of percolation, this ﬁnding seems to be a promis-
ing venue to study solar magnetism, similar to other processes in the cosmic
plasma (see, e.g., Milovanov et al., 2001). The ﬁrst steps to apply the percolation
theory in the solar ﬁeld of research were already undertaken (see, e.g., Wentzel
and Seiden, 1992; Pustil’nik, 1999; Schatten, 2007). The inherent properties of
any percolation process – power-law spectra, self-organization of large structures
amid chaos, spontaneous transitions into a critical state – are of vital importance
for our further understanding of the nature of solar magnetism.
