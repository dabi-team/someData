On the Role of Water Vapor and Process Gasses in Low-Temperature
Gold-Catalyzed Graphene Etching

Abstract

The ability to pattern graphene at low temperatures in a scalable manner is one of the greatest chal-
lenges facing graphene industrial adoption today. We demonstrate a simple method for low-temperature
gold-catalyzed etching of graphite with predictable characteristics using ambient air at 350 − 375 ◦C. The
naturally occurring water vapor in ambient air is necessary for this reaction to occur. In addition, we char-
acterize the etch characteristics as a function of process parameters. Ar annealing is required to obtain
crystallographically straight etches, and 375 ◦C is required to obtain single-layer deep etching. We anticipate
that this work can be adapted by future research to precisely control the shape of the etched areas, allowing
for the simple low-temperature creation of nanoscale graphite features, and ultimately can be applied to
single-layer graphene sheets for integrated device fabrication.

Introduction

The Bergius process has been used for more than a cen-
tury to hydrogenate coal and produce hydrocarbon fuel
(1–3). It requires high temperatures and pressure, and
the presence of a metal catalyst.
It has found other
uses as well, from the removal of carbon residue from
combustion mechanisms to boosting fuel cell eﬃciency
(4–6). As the need for nanoscale patterning techniques
for graphene has arisen since 2004, various avenues have
been taken to investigate this reaction as a potential so-
lution (7, 8). The ability of speciﬁc metals to provide
distinct etch patterns on graphite suggests the poten-
tial for catalytic cutting methods to provide a pathway
to the high-resolution patterning of graphene that is
desired.

Due to graphene’s excellent conductivity, tunable
electrical properties, and atomic size, there is consider-
able interest in incorporating it into electronic devices
(9). Its potential as a replacement for silicon in micro-
processors, could ultimately be applied to integrated
device fabrication through the simple low-temperature
creation of nanoscale graphene features. Additionally,
its high surface area and charge mobility make it a pop-
ular candidate for ultracapacitor research (10). Graphene
is a natural choice for future advanced DNA sequencing
techniques which rely on its unique thinness and high
conductivity to resolve small electrical variations across
individual DNA bases passing through a nanogap (11).
In order to be realized, all of these ambitions require
high-resolution patterning of single-layer graphene.

Previously developed patterning methods include

reactive-ion etching (12), scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) lithography (13), atomic force microscope local
oxidation lithography (14), transmission electron mi-
croscope drilling (15, 16), and chemically-derived tech-
niques (17).
In general, these techniques are too re-
source intensive to enable the simple cost-eﬀective pro-
duction of integrated graphene component devices. High-
temperature catalytic etching techniques appear par-
ticularly appealing since they can speciﬁcally etch in
the zig-zag direction (7, 8, 18–20). However,
it re-
quires high temperatures of 900 − 1100◦C for the re-
action to take place, limiting its usefulness. Recently,
a low-temperature catalytic etching technique was dis-
covered, but the only type of etched shapes that were
produced were nanopores and no crystallographic pref-
erence was observed (21, 22). Both Han et al. (21) and
Gethers et al. (22) argued that oxygen is responsible for
Au-catalyzed graphene etching. Here, we demonstrate
instead that hydrogen available in naturally present
water vapor is responsible. In addition, we also demon-
strate that control over the etching characteristics can
be attained with careful surface preparation and con-
trol of process parameters. This method may ulti-
mately be applied to single-layer graphene sheets for
integrated device fabrication.

Methods and materials

We tested samples to determine the viability of gold-
catalyzed etching, as well as to characterize the reac-
tion and the type of cuts produced.

Surface preparation

Control experiments

Firstly, we prepared thin ﬂakes of HOPG by separat-
ing them from a block of bulk material (NT-MDT Co.,
ZYB grade, 7 × 7 × 1.0 mm3). The top surface of our
HOPG block was “cleaned” of amorphous carbon and
other contaminants by exfoliating it with blue Nitto
tape (Nitto, SPV 224PRM). Next, a thin ﬂake (0.25 −
0.5 mm) of the HOPG was isolated from the bulk mass
by shearing it oﬀ using a razor blade. This graphite
ﬂake was then mounted to a glass microscope slide us-
ing double-sided tape and it was placed into a thermal
metal evaporator (Thermionics VE-90 Vacuum Evap-
orator), along with several pellets of 99.9% gold evap-
oration material (Super Conductor Materials Inc., lot
# 22810-16), and 2 nm of gold were deposited onto the
HOPG surface, under a vacuum pressure of ∼ 1 × 107 bar
at a rate of 0.2 ˚A s−1.

Argon anneal

Each sample was subjected to at least one heat treat-
ment step.
It is known that, for catalytic etching to
commence, the deposited gold ﬁlm must be annealed
and converted to discrete nanoparticles (7, 8, 19, 20).
In this process, heat is applied to the sample, causing
the metal to becoming molten and begin moving across
the surface driven by Brownian motion (20). A subset
of samples was annealed in a ﬂow of Ar at 0.600 L s−1.
We used a Thermo Scientiﬁc Lindberg Blue M furnace,
with a maximum temperature of 1100◦C, and an MKS
Multi Gas Controller Type 647C.

Air etching

Next, samples were heated in the presence of ambient
air to induce catalysis. The ambient air was temper-
ature controlled to 21 ◦C and had a relative humidity
level of 20 − 50% during the months over which these
experiments were performed. The ends of our furnace
tube were simply disconnected from the gas source, and
left open to the room air. Each 25◦ increment between
25◦C and 375◦C was tested, to determine the point at
which the etching starts. Once we had identiﬁed this
temperature as 350◦C, we tested the eﬀect of temper-
ature and etch duration.

Gold removal

Any residual gold was then removed by a 30 s immer-
sion in KI2-I2 gold etchant (Transene Company Inc.,
Gold Etch – Type TFA), followed by two 30 s immer-
sions in DI water, a 30 s immersion in isopropyl alcohol,
and ﬁnally being blown dry.

Once we had established the temperature and process-
ing steps to etch the graphite surface, we performed the
following control experiments. We demonstrated that
gold deposition and Argon anneal only does not cause
any etching, showing that it is one of the constituents
of air that is responsible. In addition, we tested that an
Argon anneal and hot air exposure without Au present
does not etch the graphite either, demonstrating that
the Au is a necessary component of this etch process.

Desiccated air

The eﬀect of the humidity level was tested by expos-
ing the tube surface to desiccated air. Ambient air
was pumped through a desiccator and then through a
chamber with a hygrometer. The desiccated air was
then ﬂushed through the furnace for 30 min while it
was held at 100 ◦C. The furnace was then closed at
both ends and raised to the desired ‘etch’ temperature.

Scan with STM

All samples were examined with an STM (Nanosurf
easyScan 2) for signs of etched areas or other notable
changes. The tip voltage was held at 50 mV, and the
current setpoint was set to 1 nA. These settings were
constant across all scans. Images were taken at many
scan sizes, from the maximum setting of 1.2 × 1.2 µm2
down to several nm2. Nanosurf’s Easyscan 2 software
was used to control the STM and record images [ﬁgure
1].

Analysis

Samples which showed signiﬁcant features as compared
to the controls were analyzed using various software
packages, including Gwyddion, Adobe Photoshop, and
GNU Octave. Etched areas were characterized for their
surface area, depth, straightness, and crystallographic
orientation.

Surface area etched

The surface area etched was determined by visually
masking oﬀ the etched areas using image editing soft-
ware and converting the number of masked pixels to a
physical surface area.

These quantities were recorded for many scans per
individual sample. In order to ﬁnd a trend correlating
the surface area removed with the total scan surface
area, a linear regression was performed over all of the
data points for each scan [ﬁgure 2]. The slopes of these
regression lines reveals a unique signature for each sam-
ple: the percent surface area etched. This quantity was
compared across all samples in order to look for trends.

Etch depth

Surface area etched

To determine the depth of an etched area, a height pro-
ﬁle was taken across it and read at the top and bottom
[ﬁgure 3].
In the case of trenches, the height diﬀer-
ence between both sides of the trench and the bottom
were taken and averaged, to account for any slope in
the original scan. This depth was then rounded to the
nearest graphene step height (335 pm) (23) in order to
obtain the number of graphene layers removed.

In the absence of an Ar anneal, there is no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between etching for 30 min at 350 and 375 ◦C
[ﬁgure 4]. With an Ar anneal step, the amount of sur-
face area etched more than doubles if the etch duration
If the etch duration is reduced to
is held at 30 min.
15 min, however, the etched area is reduced for 350 ◦C.
Finally, the amount of surface area etched is almost
null when the air is desiccated.

Etch direction

Etch depth

Previous studies of metal-nanoparticle-catalyzed graphene
etching have noted a strong crystallographic orienta-
tion to the resulting features, with the zig-zag axis be-
ing energetically favorable (7, 8, 19, 20). Seeking to
determine if this is also true for gold-catalyzed reac-
tions, we took high-magniﬁcation STM scans adjacent
to an etched area in order to image the graphene lat-
tice.

Etch straightness

A visual inspection of every etch feature visible was
made to determine its degree of straightness. Straight
etches are desirable because they indicate strong ad-
herence to a crystallographic axis, and because they
are more useful when considering possible uses of this
technique. The quantity of straight vs. non-straight
etches was calculated as a percentage for each sample,
and the percentages for each sample were compared to
ﬁnd any trends correlating percent straight etches and
the processing steps used to create that sample.

24 samples were tested across varying processing
and heating steps. Of these, only those samples which
received a catalytic heating step of 350 ◦C or higher
showed signs of catalytic etching. Across these samples,
∼ 100 distinct scans were taken, and ∼ 500 etched
features were examined.

Results

Of the samples which did show etched features, 4 pri-
mary types are seen [ﬁgure 1]; straight etched lines,
‘trenches’, which have a well-deﬁned width and pro-
ceed in a constant direction across the length of the
scan; ‘snaky’ trenches that show some deviation from
straightness, and whose width varies across the scan;
branching and amorphous areas, with many small straight
lines and large amorphous patches; and ‘edge cuts’,
which are rounded areas removed from graphite edges
.

The etch depth is analyzed for all process parameters
studied [ﬁgure 5]. We ﬁnd that Ar annealing alone does
not cause all etching to be only a single graphene layer
deep, while etching at 375 ◦C following an Ar anneal
causes all etches to be only a single graphene layer deep.

Etch direction

Atomic resolution images show that etching of trenches
occurs predominantly in the zig-zag direction, in line
with the work concerning other metal catalyst particles
[ﬁgure 6].

Etch straightness

The percentage of straight etches per sample was de-
termined by visual inspection. Samples that experi-
ences Ar annealing have a higher percentage of straight
etches [ﬁgure 7].

Ar annealing

Ar annealing was not necessary for catalytic etching
to be performed, although it did have an eﬀect on the
quality of the etches. Samples which underwent Ar
annealing have larger surface areas etched, and a higher
percentage of internal etches and straight etches [ﬁgure
4, 5, 7].

Discussion

Surface area and catalytic saturation

We ﬁnd that the activation energy for the catalytic re-
action is not reached until after 350 ◦C. From there, the
etch rate increases with time and temperature; how-
ever, the etched amount increases much more dramati-
cally when the time is doubled at 350 ◦C than at 375 ◦C.
It is important to note that catalyst particles have a
saturation point at which they lose their catalytic abil-
ity. Beyond this point, they become supersaturated
with carbon, and may actually begin to expel carbon
nanotubes (24, 25). We conclude that the increase in

3

surface area etched when going from 15 to 30 min at
375 ◦C is small because by 15 min, the catalyst is al-
ready approaching its saturation point, and thus the
catalytic activity given additional reaction time is lim-
ited. At 350 ◦C, the reaction occurs more slowly, and
thus the gains possible with additional time are more
signiﬁcant.

a higher proportion of straight etches – ones that are
more crystallographically oriented. We posit that an-
nealing the gold ﬁlm into nanoparticles under Ar pre-
vents them from performing any catalysis until they
have achieved a stable, well-deﬁned nanoparticle, which
would better hew to a single crystallographic axis when
cutting.

Etch origination and depth

Nature of the catalytic reaction

It appears that the gold catalyst particles are capable
of etching downward into the plane of a single graphene
layer, but at that point it becomes energetically favor-
able to continue in a lateral direction. Since they are
only consuming carbon from a single layer at a time,
these cuts can span large distances. However, cuts that
begin at an edge have carbon atoms from all of the lay-
ers included in the step height available to them, and
thus they can be much deeper. Accordingly, the gold
saturates much faster, and these cuts are typically not
as long. These results agree with ﬁndings with diﬀerent
metal catalysts at higher temperatures (7, 8).

Ar annealing and catalytic potential

Annealing in Ar has the eﬀect of increasing the amount
etched by a large margin. We argue that the deposited
gold ﬁlm must be annealed into individual droplets be-
fore any catalytic cutting can occur. If this happens in
the presence of an inert Ar atmosphere, then no carbon
is taken up by the gold as it assembles into particles.
Once the nanoparticles have formed under Ar, they can
begin etching the graphite without already containing
carbon, thus having more catalytic potential.
If this
step is skipped, then the gold must form nanoparticles
in a heated air atmostphere, so they begin to pick up
carbon even before they form the necessary droplets.
Other studies have similarly noted the deleterious ef-
fect of carbon-bearing contamination on etch potential
(8).

Notably, we observe that among the unannealed
samples, more area was etched at 350 ◦C than at 375 ◦C.
While this is counter-intuitive in light of previous con-
clusions, a look at other trends exhibited by the 375 ◦C
conditions also show the highest percentages of edge
etches and multi-layer etches indicating that the cata-
lyst on this sample was mostly spent on etching through
the side faces of multi-layer graphene steps.

Crystallographic orientation and straight-
ness

It appears that the etching of trenches occurs along
the zig-zag axis. This is the same observation made by
other groups exploring reactions with other metal cat-
alysts (7, 8, 19, 20). The Ar annealed samples exhibit

4

Both Han et al. (21) and Gethers et al. (22) argued
that oxygen is responsible for Au-catalyzed graphene
etching that we observe here, but did not provide con-
trols that point to oxygen conclusively. In contrast, we
demonstrate naturally present water vapor is respon-
sible for the etching behavior. We assume that the
reaction responsible for carbon etching is hydrogena-
tion, and the hydrogen source is chemisorbed on the
surface of the gold particles from ambient water vapor,
as is seen on nickel surfaces (26).

Due to the commonalities shared by these results
with those of other metal-nanoparticle catalytic etch-
ing studies (7, 8, 19, 20), it has been assumed here that
the reaction responsible for this is the same – hydro-
genation of carbon into methane.

Conclusion and Outlook

Here we have shown that a thin layer of gold, an-
nealed under Ar and heated in the presence of am-
bient air, can serve as an eﬀective catalyst to produce
useful and predictable etch patterns in bulk HOPG at
much reduced temperatures compared to previously-
investigated metal catalysts. Varying the time, tem-
perature, and pre-processing of this reaction can al-
low for the results to be tailored for the etch char-
acteristics desired. We demonstrate that water va-
por is a necessary ingredient for the etching to occur.
Ar annealing is required to obtain crystallographically
straight etches, and 375 ◦C is required to obtain single-
layer deep etching. We believe that this work can be
adapted to develop more advanced and speciﬁc etch-
ing techniques, such as patterning, and can ultimately
be adapted to single-layer graphene. This would allow
for a simple way to pattern an atomically-thin mate-
rial at the nanometer scale, while oﬀering ﬂexibility
in the fabrication process due to the reduced tempera-
ture necessary. Further, by varying the process to favor
the supersaturation of the gold nanoparticles instead of
single-layer trench etching, we believe that this method
could also potentially be adapted to deliberately culti-
vate carbon nanotube expulsion.

height and dotted red line shows calculated y-axis and x-
axis measurements adjusted for scanning-tip artifacts.

Figure 4: Etched area for conditions as indicated.
Blue and green bars indicated experiments without and
with Ar anneal, resp., and atmospheric air conditions.
The red bar indicates an Ar anneal and use of dessi-
cated air.

Figure 6: STM image of characteristic zig-zag trench
etching.
Inset image shows the atomic lattice in the
sampled area. Purple bars mark the crystallographic
alignment with etching happening preferably along the
zig-zag axis.
