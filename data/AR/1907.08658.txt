Recently, we developed a new method for generating eﬀective core potentials (ECPs) using valence
energy isospectrality with explicitly correlated all-electron (AE) excitations and norm-conservation
criteria. We apply this methodology to the 3rd-row main group elements, creating new correlation
consistent eﬀective core potentials (ccECPs) and also derive additional ECPs to complete the ccECP
table for H-Kr. For K and Ca, we develop Ne-core ECPs and for the 4p main group elements, we
construct [Ar]3d10-core potentials. Scalar relativistic eﬀects are included in their construction. Our
ccECPs reproduce AE spectra with signiﬁcantly better accuracy than many existing pseudopoten-
tials and show better overall consistency across multiple properties. The transferability of ccECPs
is tested on monohydride and monoxide molecules over a range of molecular geometries. For the
constructed ccECPs we also provide optimized DZ - 6Z valence Gaussian basis sets.

INTRODUCTION

Eﬀective core potentials (ECPs) are widely used in
electronic structure calculations of molecular and con-
densed systems. ECPs simplify these calculations by
eliminating the core electrons, which usually do not sig-
niﬁcantly contribute to the valence electronic structure.
Additionally, scalar and even spin-orbit relativistic eﬀects
can be included in the ECP in a straightforward way. For
some calculations, the use of ECPs is essentially unavoid-
able, especially for cases involving very heavy elements.
For instance, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods
(Z 5.5−6.5) [1, 2];
scale poorly with nuclear charge, Z, as
without the ability to reduce Z via an ECP, QMC simula-
tions would quickly become computationally prohibitive
for heavy elements.

O

In recent decades, a number of ECP tables have
been developed from various construction schemes
and concepts. One such strategy is to use shape-
consistency/norm-conservation of the single-particle or-
bitals, where for a given reference state the pseudo-
orbitals are made to match the all-electron orbitals out-
side of a chosen cut-oﬀ radius. An alternative approach
has been to ﬁt AE Hartree-Fock/Dirac-Fock (HF/DF)
atomic excitations and gaps, known as energy consis-
tency. These published tables have led to substan-
tial progress by enabling large-scale calculations of both

molecular and condensed systems. However, many of
these studies have involved methods with mixed levels
of accuracy such as Density Functional Theory (DFT)
or correlated wave function approaches far from conver-
gence.

Advancements in many-body theories and progress in
computational platforms have made the quality of ECPs
crucial for obtaining high accuracy for larger systems and
a broader range of elements. To the best of our knowl-
edge, the use of many-body theories and incorporation of
correlation eﬀects in the development of ECPs has been
rather limited [3–8].

Very recently, we have constructed correlation consis-
tent ECPs (ccECPs) for the ﬁrst two rows (period 2, 3)
[9, 10] as well as the 3d transition metal series [11]. In
this work, we expand the ccECP library to include the
3rd-row main group elements, i.e, K, Ca, Ga, Ge, As, Se,
Br, and Kr. We also derive additional ECPs, hitherto
missing from the ccECP table, i.e. H, He, Li, Be, F, and
Ne.

Let us brieﬂy recall the ideas and the guidelines in the

generation of ccECPs[9–11]:

1. We use a many-body construction, i.e., the incor-
poration of correlation eﬀects. Fully correlated,
relativistic AE calculations are taken as reference
as opposed to mean-ﬁeld frameworks such as HF
or DFT. Coupled cluster with singles, doubles and
perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) is used in the op-
timization.

the ECP. The ccECPs are expressed in a well-

established functional form [12] that is captured by
a few gaussians per symmetry channel.

We employ a semi-local ECP functional form given as:

3. We test the transferability of the ccECPs in molec-
ular systems, ranging from compressed to stretched
molecular geometries. This serves as a check on the
ccECP outside equilibrium.

4. We establish an open database for future devel-
opments. The ccECPs are hosted at http://
pseudopotentiallibrary.org with systematic la-
bels and updates which is open to other contribu-
tors.

Obviously, our ccECPs do not represent the ultimate
accuracy limit of pseudopotentials, although we believe
that we have obtained results that are close to these accu-
racy limits within the given form, number of parameters,
and core choices considered. Clearly, more elaborate pa-
rameterizations are possible for ﬁner accuracy targets.
For instance, core-polarization eﬀects and explicit spin-
orbit coupling operators could be added subsequently,
but that is beyond the scope of this paper. We have tried
to achieve chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol) for all proper-
ties and in many cases, we have been successful. In cases
where this demand was too strict, we have constructed
the ccECPs to show systematic and balanced errors that
are more consistent than most of the published tables
thus far.

The paper is structured as follows. We discuss the cho-
sen functional form and parameterization for the ccECPs
in Section II A. In Section II B, the objective function and
optimization strategies are examined. The results for K
and Ca are presented in Section III A and Ga - Kr are
presented in Section III B. We provide additional opti-
mized ccECPs for selected elements in Section III C that
includes H, He, Li, Be, F and Ne. Some of these addi-
tional ECPs also include an AE version that smooths out
the Coulomb divergence in the potential. Together with
our previous papers, this covers all the elements from
H through Kr. The optimization of valence basis sets is
discussed in Section III D. Finally, we present conclusions
and further discussions in Section IV.

II. METHODS

A. ECP Parametrization

The goal of this work is to approximate the relativistic
AE Hamiltonian with a simpler valence only Hamilto-
nian, Hval, where we assume the Born-Oppenheimer ap-
proximation [13]. The valence Hamiltonian is given by
the following expression in atomic units (a.u):

Hval =

(cid:88)

[T kin

where i is the electron index and ri is the electron-ion
distance. The non-local term contains angular momen-
tum projectors on (cid:96)m-th state. (cid:96)max is the maximum
angular momentum number of non-local channel projec-
tors included in the ECP. Here, we choose (cid:96)max = 2 for
4p elements due to 3d10 electrons being in the core. For
K and Ca, (cid:96)max = 1. Vloc(ri) is the local channel where
at the origin, Coulomb singularity is explicitly canceled
out and Vloc(ri)’s ﬁrst derivative vanishes at the origin
[12]:

where Zeﬀ is the eﬀective core charge, Zeﬀ = Z
Zcore
and α, β, γk and δk are coeﬃcients to be optimized. The
choice of a non-singular form results in smooth orbitals
that reduces computational resources such as sizes of ba-
sis sets as well as higher eﬃciency sampling in QMC. The
non-local term V(cid:96)(ri) has the following form:

−

V(cid:96)(r) =

(cid:88)

j=1

β(cid:96)je−α(cid:96)j r2

,

(4)

where βlj are αlj are optimized non-local channel coeﬃ-
cients. This simple and compact form of ECP is chosen
so that the ECPs can be readily used in standard quan-
tum chemistry packages and other electronic structure
codes in general. The simplicity of the form also makes
the optimization process easier as commented upon later.

B. Objective Function and Optimization
Methodologies

Similarly to our previous ccECP constructions, the ob-
jective function is a weighted combination of several com-
ponents such as energy consistency/isospectrality and
terms related to orbital shape and norm conservation.
The energy consistency part of the objective function is
given as follows

2 =

E

(cid:88)

s∈S

(cid:0)∆EECP

∆EAE
s

(cid:1)2

,

(5)

where the energy ”gap” ∆EECP
is the CCSD(T) energy
s
diﬀerence for the state s relative to the ground state of
the pseudoatom. The states that we include are several
neutral excitations, a number of ionized states, and elec-
tron aﬃnity states for anions that are bounded. ∆EAE
is
the corresponding quantity in the all-electron atom with

s

10th order scalar relativistic Douglass-Kroll-Hess Hamil-
tonian [14]. Therefore, relativistic eﬀects are inherently
included in our ccECPs.

It is important to note that all AE calculations in this
work are fully correlated. In other words, they include
valence-valence (VV), core-valence (CV) and core-core
correlations (CC). Typically, ECPs include only VV cor-
relations, however, the inclusion of CC+CV+VV correla-
tions in the AE reference is essential for several aspects as
well as in the optimization as it will be shown in Section
III.

Isospectrality is a crucial property of an ECP since it
relies on actual observable quantities. However, as we
have shown in previously, the optimization of the spec-
trum alone can result in reduced transferability of the
ECP since the atomic spectrum can be overﬁt at the ex-
pense of other properties. Therefore, we make use of ad-
ditional norm/shape conservation related function which
is given as:

where the following ECP quantities are matched to rel-
ativistic AE counterparts as explained below. (cid:15)AE
are
one-particle eigenvalues and these are matched for all
(cid:96) angular momentum channels. To evaluate the quan-
tities inside the brackets, a cut-oﬀ radius R(cid:96) is cho-
sen as the outer-most extremum of r 4
. Then, the
norm N AE

γ = 0 resulted in accurate molecular properties, however,
in some cases, we set γ = 1 to further improve the trans-
ferability. The total objective function is then:

Calculation of

2 is the most expensive/demanding
part of the objective function evaluation since we in-
cluded
10 atomic state energies where each must be
evaluated at CCSD(T) level with a large, uncontracted
basis set.
In order to alleviate this cost, we proposed
a recipe to signiﬁcantly speed up the optimization pro-
cedure in our 3d transition metal paper [11]. Here, we
brieﬂy recall that approach. It is known that the corre-
lation energies of various ECPs, even constructed in dif-
ferent approaches are essentially the same, unlike their
corresponding HF energies. This allows one to map the
CCSD(T) gaps to a mean-ﬁeld gap by shifting the corre-
sponding HF energy with a quantity related to diﬀerences
in AE and ECP correlation energies. Therefore, the ECP
correlation energies need not be calculated at every step
of the optimization and the objective function is evalu-
ated with a cheaper, appropriately shifted HF calcula-
tion. Furthermore, this enables us to use relatively small

3

basis-sets (unc-aug-ccpwCTZ) in the optimization since
the HF-level complete basis-set (CBS) values are reached
quickly. This methodology allows us to use CCSD(T) in
the optimization in a computationally less costly man-
ner while keeping essentially the same level of accuracy.
More detailed discussion is given in the aforementioned
work.

The quantum chemistry packages Molpro[15] and
PySCF[16] were used for evaluation of the objective
functions throughout this work. The nonlinear optimiza-
tion code Donlp2[17] was used to optimize the ccECP
parameters. Most ccECP parameters in the optimiza-
tion are initialized either from BFD[12] or STU[18–20]
pseudopotentials.

III. RESULTS

In this section, we provide the atomic spectrum results
and molecular transferability tests for all the elements
mentioned above. For each element, we show the quality
of the spectrum by tabulating the mean absolute devia-
tion (MAD) of the ECP gaps with respect to AE values.
The MAD is given as:

For Ga - Kr these quantities and errors are provided at
CBS limit and for the other lighter atoms these are given
at unc-aug-cc-pCV5Z basis set. In order to obtain the
CBS limit energy, SCF and correlation energies are ex-
trapolated separately. The HF energy extrapolation has
the following form

EHF

n = EHF

CBS + a exp(

bn),

−

(9)

where n is the basis size, EHF
CBS is the HF CBS limit value,
and a and b are ﬁt parameters. The correlation energy is
extrapolated as

Ecorr

n = Ecorr

CBS +

c
(n + 3/8)3 +

d
(n + 3/8)5 ,

(10)

where c and d are other ﬁt parameters. The basis set used
in extrapolation is uncontracted aug-cc-pwCVnZ[21, 22]
where n=(T, Q, 5).

We also evaluated the errors of other established ECPs
so as to demonstrate the degree of
improvement in
our ccECP pseudopotentials. The ECPs considered are
BFD[12], YSTU (Y=
),
SDF[18], MWB[19], MDF[20]
}
{
SBKJC[23, 24], eCEPP[8], CRENBL[25, 26]. We also
present the calculations for an AE uncorrelated-core
(UC), where there are only VV correlations considered
and the core is of the same size as in the ECPs. The
same uncontracted basis sets and extrapolation schemes
are used for these core approximations for consistency.
We note that only VV correlations are present in our

ccECP calculations.
In addition, we want to empha-
size that we did not include core polarization/relaxation
(CPP) terms into ccECPs, neither considered these when
using the other existing tables. One reason for this choice
has been our primary goal to probe for the limits of ac-
curacy of the very simplest ECP form. Additional reason
has been our aim for the widest possible use and the fact
that in majority of condensed/periodic matter codes such
terms are not currently implemented. Clearly, this can
be addressed in future studies.

For each element, the quality/transferability of the
ccECP is tested by comparing the binding energy of the
ECP for selected molecules to the fully correlated AE
case which utilizes relativistic DKH Hamiltonian. The
binding energy is calculated for a variety of molecular ge-
ometries, including for compressed geometries up to the
dissociation bond length, having in mind potential high-
pressure applications. The discrepancy ∆(r) between the
ECP and AE is plotted for all calculated molecules:

∆(r) = De(r)ECP

where µ is the reduced mass of the molecule. Fitted
De, re, ωe and Ddiss (binding energy at the dissociation
threshold at the short bond lengths) are compared to AE
counterparts to assess the transferability of an ECP for
a particular molecule.

We consider the monohydride and monoxide molecules
as our test systems to probe the σ and π bonds. In some
cases, the homonuclear dimer was also used if it formed
the same type of bonds as in the above cases. Other ECP
tests are included as well for comparison. Each oxygen
ECP is taken from the corresponding ECP table and our
ccECP hydrogen is used throughout all hydride tests.

All transferability tests were carried out at unc-aug-cc-
pwCV5Z basis sets unless otherwise speciﬁed. From lim-
ited tests on SeO, we observed that no signiﬁcant changes
occur in the discrepancy of binding energies ∆(r) com-
pared to the CBS limit (see supplementary material).

In table II, we show a summary of spectrum discrep-
ancies of all examined ECPs compared to AE spectrum.
The MAD of the entire spectrum and the MAD of some
selected low-lying states (LMAD) are given while for Li
and Be we give the MAD values only. MDFSTU and
MWBSTU are combined in one column since they are
mutually exclusive for each of the atoms considered in

this work. Only available ECP MADs are listed with
the rest left blank. The calculated AE spectrum and
ECP discrepancies for each atom can be found in the
supplementary material. A summary graph of MADs
and LMADs for 3rd-row main group elements is shown
in ﬁgure 1.

All optimized ccECP parameters are provided in ta-
bles I and V in semi-local form. The tables assume the
following common format of the potential

The core radii of ccECPs are tabulated in table VIII and
valence basis sets are discussed in Section III D.

elements. For each atom, we provide MAD of the entire
calculated spectrum and MAD of selected low-lying
atomic states (LMAD). The LMAD atomic states
include electron aﬃnity, ﬁrst and second ionizations
only. The solid lines represent MAD and the dashed
lines represent LMAD. The shaded region indicates the
band of chemical accuracy.

A. K and Ca atoms

In this subsection, we explain the results for K and Ca
atoms. These atoms use Ne-core ECPs and they involve
only s and p non-local projectors.

Table II shows the MAD and LMAD of the spectrum
discrepancies of various core approximations for the K
atom. The chosen spectrum includes neutral d exci-
tations, electron aﬃnity state, and all ionizations until

[Ne]3s2. Here, the least MAD corresponds to MDFSTU
and the least LMAD corresponds to BFD. Figure 2 shows
binding energy discrepancy ∆(r) of diﬀerent ECPs for
KH and KO molecules. The shaded region indicates the
chemical accuracy of 0.043 eV and the vertical dashed
line marks the equilibrium bond length. Although all
ECPs are within chemical accuracy, the ccECP is closest
to zero and ﬂatter near the KO molecule equilibrium ge-
ometry. Note that a ﬂat discrepancy curve will result in
a better vibrational frequency from the ﬁt. It should be
noted that CRENBL ECP produces also very accurate

molecular properties for KH and KO, however, it has
singularities in both the attractive/local and repulsive
nonlocal channels. Our ccECP has a reasonable balance
of MAD and LMAD but arguably is more accurate in
transferability, especially near the equilibrium region.

Atomic data for Ca atom is given in table II as well.
Here, ccECP has a signiﬁcantly lower MAD in the spec-
trum compared to all other core approximations. The
lowest LMAD corresponds to CRENBL although its
MAD is still signiﬁcantly higher than ccECP. Binding en-
ergy discrepancies for CaH and CaO are shown in ﬁgure

3. We see that in CaO, most core approximations un-
derbind as the bond is compressed whereas ccECP has
minimal errors throughout all geometries.

In table III, we give the MAD of all ﬁtted parameters
of Morse potential in Eqn. (12) for K and Ca molecules
(KH, KO, CaH, CaO) as a summary of transferability.
We ﬁnd that the ccECP results in almost the same trans-
ferability as CRENBL with a minor exception in ωe. It is
again worthwhile to mention that CRENBL, SBKJC, and
STU ECP parameterizations diﬀer from BFD, eCEPP,
and ccECP form where the Coulomb and other singu-
larities are absent by construction. Therefore, we con-
jecture that the accuracy achieved in ccECP is close to
the best possible ﬁt within the given form and additional

optimized gaussians will likely result in only mild and
diminishing improvements.

In summary, we see that due to the valence space being
large in K and Ca, chemical accuracy can be achieved for
molecules and for a large part of the atomic spectrum.

B. Ga - Kr atoms

This subsection discusses the results for 4p elements:
Ga - Kr. These atoms use a large [Ar]3d10 core ECPs
with s, p, and d non-local channel operators. In this set
of atoms, the valence space(4s and 4p) is smaller and the
energy scales are signiﬁcantly higher, resulting in larger

errors in both spectrum and molecular binding energies.
This is especially pronounced for higher ionization states
and in compressed bond regions.

Table II shows the MADs and LMADs of the consid-
ered spectrum for Ga - Kr atoms. For each element, we
choose a consistent set of excitations/gaps relative to the
ground state which represents the spectrum. The spec-
trum consists of electron aﬃnity, all ionization potentials
down to single electron in the valence space, 4s
4p
excited states and various 4d occupied states.

→

In all cases, our ccECP has

lower MAD and
LMAD compared to all core approximations including
uncorrelated-core (UC). The only exception to this is Ge
where SBKJC achieves lower MAD although it is higher
in LMAD while SDFSTU achieves lower LMAD but is
higher in MAD. We believe the ccECP is perhaps the
most reasonable compromise between these two; this be-
comes clearer by looking at molecular discrepancies (ﬁg-

ure 5). Speaking in general terms, signiﬁcant gains in
accuracy are obtained for As, Se, Br, and Kr elements
while Ga and Ge show modest improvements or are on
par with previously published constructions. However,
we are pleased to see more consistent improvements in
molecular properties in our ccECPs as follows.

We show the transferability results for these elements
in ﬁgures 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 which are hydride and oxide
molecules for Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr atoms respectively.
For GaO molecule, we omit the UC molecular binding
discrepancy curve where we were unable to converge the
coupled cluster molecular calculations correctly. For Kr,
we calculate the KrH+ discrepancies only. Similarly to
the picture seen in the MAD of the spectrum, the ccECP
has the lowest errors in molecular properties when com-
pared to all other core approximations. We observe im-
provements in Ga and Ge molecules while As molecular

properties show more notable gains in accuracy. Signiﬁ-
cant improvements are seen in Se, Br, and Kr where the
ccECP is essentially always within chemical accuracy for
both hydrides and oxides in all bond lengths up to disso-
ciation limit. The summary of MADs of Morse potential
ﬁt parameters can be seen in table IV. We can see that
our ccECP has the smallest errors on De, re and Ddiss
when compared to other ECPs. Only BFD has a smaller
error in ωe, however, this result is not fully consistent
with errors for the other parameters being notably larger.
In these 4p main group elements, we observe that
the achieved ccECP MADs are signiﬁcantly higher when
compared to K and Ca. Also, we were not able to achieve

chemical accuracy in some compressed oxides although
all ccECP hydrides are essentially within 1 kcal/mol.
This is mainly due to the smaller size of the valence space.
If higher accuracy is desired, a smaller core with a larger
valence space will be required, but it is beyond the scope
of this work.

and Ne

lished sets to complete our ccECP table for elements H
through Kr. The elements considered here are H, He, Li,
Be, F and Ne.

For H, He, Li and Be, we developed local pseudopo-
tentials, where there are no non-local operators and no
electrons are removed. These all-electron ECPs are used
to cancel the Coulomb singularity which can be useful for
computational eﬃciency purposes, thus resulting in soft,
regularized potentials. We indicate these ECPs by label
”reg” whenever there is ambiguity.

Although H ccECP was published before [11], we pro-
vide the missing molecular tests here. We show the qual-
ity of regularized H and He ECPs by transferability tests

on H2 and HeH+ molecules which are shown in ﬁgure 10.
Note that the originally published BFD ECP signiﬁcantly
over-binds the H2 molecule due to a rather signiﬁcant ra-
dial span of the regularized Coulomb potential.

For Li and Be, we also developed He-core ECPs with
an s non-local channel apart from all-electron pseu-
dopotentials. The spectrum and molecular tests for Li
and Be are given in table VI and ﬁgures 11, 12 re-
spectively. The ccECPs have the most accurate spec-
trum for both elements among all core approximations.
ccECP(reg) improves it signiﬁcantly further by achieving
MAD=0.00042 eV for Li and MAD=0.00195 eV for Be.
Note that both Li and Be dimer curves are perfectly

However, they notably underbind in F2 molecule whereas
ccECP is close AE values as can be seen in ﬁgure 13. In
Ne, the ccECP achieves the lowest MAD and LMAD in
the spectrum while achieving a more constant and overall
smaller error in NeH+ molecule, shown in ﬁgure 14.

A summary of binding parameter errors for H, He, Li,
Be, F and Ne are given in table VII. Here, ccECP has the
lowest errors when compared to all the other ECPs. In
fact, De and re show smaller errors than UC reﬂecting the
impact of taking CC and CV correlations into account.

D. Valence Basis Sets

For each ccECP pseudoatom, we generated corre-
sponding Gaussian correlation consistent basis sets. The
provided basis sets are cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pVnZ with
n = (D, T, Q, 5, 6). The generation scheme we followed
is similar to reference [12] which is brieﬂy outlined here.
First, the HF ground state energy is minimized by op-
timizing a set of primitive exponents. The number of
primitives is chosen in a way that the exact HF energy
can be achieved with mHa accuracy or less. The expo-
nents are optimized in an ”even-tempered” way, where
only the lowest/highest exponent and the ratio between
the exponents are optimized. Obtained HF orbital coef-
ﬁcients are contracted for every occupied orbital. For K
and Ca, an extra d contraction is also added by exciting
an electron to 3d orbital.

reproduced by ccECPs although oxides show consider-
able errors, as for all other ECPs. SDFSTU however,
is distinctly better near dissociation region in LiO and
BeO. We estimate that this is due to the ECP parame-
terization and the constraints of smoothness of our ECP
form.
If higher accuracy is desired, our ccECP(reg) is
essentially ﬂat and is always within 0.015 eV error in Li
and Be dimers and oxides.

For F and Ne, we use He-core ECPs with an s non-local
channel. The spectrum MADs for F and Ne atoms are
shown in table VI. In F, ccECP has the lowest LMAD, al-
though eCEPP, SBKJC and CRENBL have lower MAD.

interaction with singles and doubles (CISD) ground state

there is only 1 valence electron present, the dimer CISD
ground state energy is minimized. The number and the
size of contractions are kept the same for all cardinal
numbers n and correlation consistent exponents are also
optimized in an even-tempered way as described in ref-

sis sets in various code formats can be found at https:

Kr. The primary departure in the generation of ECPs
from previous schemes has been the use of highly accu-
rate many-body theories and methods in the construc-
tion. Another guide in the development was to carry out
thorough tests particularly in compressed hydrides and
oxides. These validation tests are imperative since one
needs to know the inherent biases in the ECPs in order to
be able to assess the corresponding biases in subsequent
calculations.

imation breaks down. While the accuracy of ccECPs
in those systems can be improved with more sophisti-
cated parameterizations, the fundamental complication
is the missing core-core classical electrostatic interactions
which can be improved by considering a smaller core par-
titioning. Previous studies have discussed the complica-
tions in ECP construction due to these eﬀects [29–31] and
the signiﬁcant overlap of the core tails with the valence
space [10, 32].

Our ccECPs have substantially improved isospectral
and transferable properties compared to previously tab-
ulated ECPs. We observed that in certain cases such
as compressed GaO and GeO, the eﬀective core approx-

On the other hand, we observed that using an ECP
is in fact quite beneﬁcial compared to using an uncor-
related core instead. Note, for instance, in 4p element
molecules, UC almost always underbinds considerably

and the ccECP is signiﬁcantly more accurate. This ef-
fect can be seen in spectral discrepancies too, where the
ccECP has smaller errors. The main reason for this
can be understood if we recall that the electrons cor-
relate more in an ECP than in UC, i.e, the magnitude
of ECP correlation energy is larger than the AE valence-
valence counterpart; see for instance reference [33]. This
is because ECP orbitals have fewer nodes which result
in higher probabilities for electrons to correlate. There-

fore, our ccECPs capture part of CV and CC correla-
tions resulting in better molecular properties. For this
reason, the inclusion of total AE correlation energies
(CC+CV+VV) is vitally important for proper reproduc-
tion of the valence properties.

We have shown that the accuracy and transferability
of ECPs can be substantially improved by the inclusion
of many-body eﬀects. In fact, we believe that electron
correlation has an important contribution to the ﬁnal
accuracy and additional parameters such as core polar-
ization and spin-orbit terms are of secondary importance
and can be implemented subsequently.

One achievement of this work is the demonstration of
systems where accurate results are not feasible with con-
ventionally used core approximations. For example, in
LiO and BeO (ﬁgure 11b, 12b) all [He]-core approxima-
tions have signiﬁcant errors and only by including the
missing 1s2 correlations one is able to recover chemical
accuracy. The improvements represented by ccECP(reg)
can further expand the applicability such as for very high
pressures/short bond lengths situations. As stated previ-
ously, having an upfront knowledge about the ECP biases
is important and one can expect these errors to enlarge
in solid/bulk calculations.

Another accomplishment of this work including previ-
ous papers is that it provides independent tests of pre-
viously tabulated ECPs. For instance, we observed that
CRENBL and SBKJC ECPs show very high accuracy
in molecules. SDFSTU pseudopotentials also demon-
strate respectable accuracy results in few valence elec-
tron atoms. Independent tests of ccECP have also been
carried out recently [34], where the authors carry out
selected molecular tests from G2 set using CCSD(T)
and ﬁxed-node diﬀusion Monte Carlo methods. In both
cases, they ﬁnd that ccECPs have lower MAD in atom-

ization energies from experimental values when compared
to other considered ECPs. Similarly, we believe that
ccECPs achieve the best overall consistency in accuracy
and we expect that the obtained results for hydrides and
oxides will carry over to other systems and cases.

We anticipate that ccECPs will be also used in meth-
ods such as DFT, that do not build upon explicitly cor-
related many-body wave functions. Since ccECPs repro-
duce the true many-body valence part of the spectrum,
we believe that they should be used as ab initio valence
Hamiltonians per se, even within such approaches.
In
addition, our ccECPs exhibit smooth densities in the
core so that one can expect at least some alleviation of
DFT biases caused by the high values and large gradi-
ents of the original core densities. However, one cannot
expect the same type of systematic errors from cores in
all-electronic calculations to automatically transfer into
ccECP valence calculations (and procedures similar to
nonlinear core corrections [35] might be then necessary).
Furthermore, we do not expect much improvement in
the errors that stem from genuine DFT shortcomings in
the valence space (errors in atomizations, gaps, reaction
paths, etc). Clearly, further insights and calculations in
this direction could be very helpful and useful.

Future related work is the calculation of accurate
atomic ground state energies of ccECPs with various
highly precise methods such as CCSDT(Q). These ac-
curate energies will serve as a benchmark for indepen-
dent calculations and methods such as ﬁxed-node diﬀu-
sion Monte Carlo. This will be published in a forthcom-
ing paper.

V. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

The additional information about ccECPs is included
in supplementary material. Therein are given calculated
AE spectra for each element and also corresponding dis-
crepancies of various core approximations. AE, UC, and
various ECP molecular ﬁt parameters for hydrides, ox-
ides, or dimers are provided. The ccECPs in semi-local
and Kleinman-Bylander projected forms as well as opti-
mized gaussian valence basis sets in various input formats
(Molpro, GAMESS, NWChem) can be found at web-
site [36].
